81,PREFACE.,
82,PREFACE.,
83,PREFACE.,The very miscellaneous nature of the contents of this third and last
84,PREFACE.,volume of the present edition of Crabbe’s _Poems_ obliges me to trouble
85,PREFACE.,"the reader with a rather lengthy series of prefatory remarks. Before,"
86,PREFACE.,"however, entering on these, I should like to supplement what was said in"
87,PREFACE.,the Preface to Vol. 1 with regard to the source of the earliest among
88,PREFACE.,the _Juvenilia_ there printed. Since writing that Preface I have at last
89,PREFACE.,had an opportunity of examining the whole set of Vols. I-VI (for the
90,PREFACE.,"years 1770–5) of the elusive _Lady’s Magazine_, of which Vol. I was"
91,PREFACE.,"published by Robinson and Roberts, and the remaining five volumes by"
92,PREFACE.,"Robinson. Curiously enough, the 1773 volume of this _Magazine_ contains,"
93,PREFACE.,"in the February number, a long piece of verse, apparently a prize poem,"
94,PREFACE.,entitled _An Essay on Hope_; but the six lines quoted by the younger
95,PREFACE.,Crabbe are not to be found in this poem any more than in that printed in
96,PREFACE.,the October number of the 1772 volume of the _Magazine_. By another
97,PREFACE.,"coincidence, a poem called _The Bee_, signed “Louisa Broughton,” appears"
98,PREFACE.,"in the April number of the same _Magazine_ for 1774. I may add, that the"
99,PREFACE.,"June number of the same volume contains a poem, in Shenstone’s manner,"
100,PREFACE.,"addressed “To Miss E——r M——,” and signed “G. C., Cambridge, May 2,"
101,PREFACE.,"1774.” It has an apologetic introductory note, which _might have been_"
102,PREFACE.,written by Crabbe.
103,PREFACE.,
104,PREFACE.,"To turn to the present volume. The _Tales of the Hall_ (Bks. XII-XXII),"
105,PREFACE.,"which occupy its earlier pages are, like the previous _Tales_ contained"
106,PREFACE.,"in Vol. II, printed from the edition of 1823; and the variants are taken"
107,PREFACE.,from the first edition (1819) and from the “Original MS.” readings given
108,PREFACE.,as footnotes in the edition of 1834. The _Posthumous Tales_ are printed
109,PREFACE.,from Vol. VIII of the _Poetical Works of Crabbe_ edited by his son
110,PREFACE.,(1834). The sources of the variants in the _Posthumous Tales_ will be
111,PREFACE.,indicated immediately.
112,PREFACE.,
113,PREFACE.,"With regard to the remaining contents of the present volume, it may be"
114,PREFACE.,"convenient if I here, in accordance with a promise made in the Preface"
115,PREFACE.,"to Vol. II of the present edition, furnish some account of the Crabbe"
116,PREFACE.,"MSS. now in the possession of the Cambridge University Press, as well as"
117,PREFACE.,of certain other collections of MSS. of which I have been fortunate
118,PREFACE.,"enough to be allowed to make use. In each case, I have, for purposes of"
119,PREFACE.,"reference, indicated the marks by which, in a list given at the end of"
120,PREFACE.,"the Bibliography included in the present volume, the previously"
121,PREFACE.,"unpublished pieces by Crabbe, here printed from transcripts of the"
122,PREFACE.,"originals in the several collections, have been distinguished."
123,PREFACE.,
124,PREFACE.,The MS. books acquired by the Cambridge University Press (U.P.) are five
125,PREFACE.,"in number. One of these, half-bound in red, is throughout in Crabbe’s"
126,PREFACE.,"handwriting, and contains, together with fragments of the _Posthumous"
127,PREFACE.,"Tales_ I, III, VI, VII and X, and a version of _Lines written at"
128,PREFACE.,"Warwick_ (p. 428), in each case offering some variants which have been"
129,PREFACE.,"duly noted, _Joseph’s Dream_ (p. 521) and some other pieces now printed"
130,PREFACE.,"for the first time. The writing, partly in pen, partly in pencil, on the"
131,PREFACE.,"first and the last four pages of this volume, has been disregarded, as"
132,PREFACE.,not sufficiently coherent to warrant an attempt at printing it. A note
133,PREFACE.,"superscribed “Duchess of Rutland, Oct. 11th, 1824” (perhaps the lines in"
134,PREFACE.,question were written in the Duchess’s album) states that the verses
135,PREFACE.,here entitled _On a View of Barford_ (p. 505) refer to a picture drawn
136,PREFACE.,"by Miss Bagot of that house, when occupied by Mr and Mrs Mills. This"
137,PREFACE.,note further states that _An Inscription at Guy’s Cliff_ which Crabbe
138,PREFACE.,"has marked as “By ——,” and the verses added by him (p. 504) refer to a"
139,PREFACE.,"picture of Guy’s Cliff near Leamington, the property of Mr Bertie"
140,PREFACE.,Greathead. Another note explains that the verses _On a Drawing of
141,PREFACE.,Cadlands_ (p. 518) refer to a picture of Mr Drummond’s seat of that name
142,PREFACE.,by Lady Elizabeth Drummond; and that the “drawing by the Hon. Mrs. Smith
143,PREFACE.,(Eliza Forrester)” (p. 519) consisted of “a Landscape and other pieces.”
144,PREFACE.,This MS. book also contains an earlier copy of the lines entitled _La
145,PREFACE.,Femme Jalouse_ (p. 507). The last three stanzas of the poem on a drawing
146,PREFACE.,of _Brompton Park Cottage_ (p. 506) are added from the version given in
147,PREFACE.,this MS. book. From it are also taken a few readings in the stanzas _For
148,PREFACE.,the Drawing of the Lady in the Green Mantle_ (p. 520). From it is also
149,PREFACE.,"printed the fragment _Joseph and Charles_ (p. 492), with which should be"
150,PREFACE.,"compared Vol. VIII, pp. 63 sq. of the edition of 1834, and indeed the"
151,PREFACE.,whole tale of _The Family of Love_. It also contains a draft of _The
152,PREFACE.,"Equal Marriage_ (_Posthumous Tales_, III), with a few variants, noted"
153,PREFACE.,among those printed at the end of the present volume; also a draft of
154,PREFACE.,"_Silford Hall_ (_Posthumous Tales_, I), with a considerable number of"
155,PREFACE.,"variants, of which the chief have been noted in the same place. There"
156,PREFACE.,"are also to be found here drafts of _Lines written at Warwick_ (p. 428),"
157,PREFACE.,"and of the lines _On a Drawing of the Elm Tree_ (p. 431), &c., there"
158,PREFACE.,"stated to be by Miss Chilibeen(?), both with variants. Finally, the same"
159,PREFACE.,MS. book contains the lines which I have entitled _Rest in the Lord_ (p.
160,PREFACE.,"523) and the unfinished lines _And He said unto her, “Thy Sins are"
161,PREFACE.,forgiven”_ (p. 524).
162,PREFACE.,
163,PREFACE.,On the fly-leaf of a second Crabbe MS. book in the possession of the
164,PREFACE.,Cambridge University Press (U.P.) is written: “This MS. is by the Poet
165,PREFACE.,Crabbe and in his autograph. It is one of his Memorandum Books.” This
166,PREFACE.,"book begins with three pages of almost illegible verse, which appear to"
167,PREFACE.,contain an earlier draft of a portion of what follows. Then ensues the
168,PREFACE.,"long MS. entitled _Tracy_, to which is prefixed, in Crabbe’s own"
169,PREFACE.,"handwriting, the date “1 Jan. 1813,” and which is interrupted at"
170,PREFACE.,intervals by further illegible passages. On pp. “18–19” of this MS. book
171,PREFACE.,"there is an account, only in part legible, of the beginning of the"
172,PREFACE.,"Lady’s Vision, which is continued in the portion printed in the present"
173,PREFACE.,"volume (from p. 450). The lines beginning “The good are happy,” appear"
174,PREFACE.,"to form no part of _Tracy_, though they have been inserted in the middle"
175,PREFACE.,"of it, and are therefore here printed as a separate piece, to which I"
176,PREFACE.,have given the title _Conscious Guiltiness_ (p. 498). The verses
177,PREFACE.,"superscribed _Jane Adair_, which are similarly inserted in the text of"
178,PREFACE.,"_Tracy_, are likewise printed separately (p. 512), as are also those"
179,PREFACE.,"which I have respectively called _Horatio_ (p. 513), _Jacob and Rachel_"
180,PREFACE.,"(p. 514), _David and Saul_ (p. 515), _Belief and Unbelief_ (p. 499), and"
181,PREFACE.,_The Task_ (p. 498). Then follows a version of the lines _On receiving
182,PREFACE.,from a Lady a Present of a Ring_ (p. 432); then a version of _Villars_
183,PREFACE.,"(_Posthumous Tales_, V); then the fragment of a tale, which I have"
184,PREFACE.,"entitled _Susan and her Lovers_ (p. 462), interspersed with some"
185,PREFACE.,"illegible passages; then another fragment of a tale, _Captain Godfrey_"
186,PREFACE.,"(p. 468); then a further fragment, _The Amours of G[eorge]_, which is"
187,PREFACE.,"obviously an early draft, in a different metre, of a large portion of"
188,PREFACE.,"_The Elder Brother_ (_Tales of the Hall_, Bk. VII); then the _Charade_"
189,PREFACE.,(_Modesty_) (p. 516); then a variant of the conclusion of the tale of
190,PREFACE.,"_Villars_ (see above); then the lines _Tragic Tales, Why?_ a fragment"
191,PREFACE.,"(p. 474). Opening this volume at the other end, we find it to contain"
192,PREFACE.,prose-sketches of certain of the _Tales_; a criticism of Gibbon and
193,PREFACE.,other miscellaneous matter; besides the verses on _Miss Waldron’s
194,PREFACE.,"Birthday_ (p. 502), and some partially illegible and quite incoherent"
195,PREFACE.,fragments.
196,PREFACE.,
197,PREFACE.,"A third, small, MS. book (U.P.), of which the writing is throughout"
198,PREFACE.,"remarkably clear, and which has few variants from the text of the 1834"
199,PREFACE.,"edition, contains, together with fifteen of the _Posthumous Tales_, _The"
200,PREFACE.,"Funeral of the Squire_, obviously designed as one of this series, and"
201,PREFACE.,now printed for the first time (p. 489). There is nothing in this book
202,PREFACE.,that has not been previously printed except _The Funeral_.
203,PREFACE.,
204,PREFACE.,"A fourth, small, MS. book (U.P.) contains, together with some fragments"
205,PREFACE.,"of _Tales of the Hall_, Bks. VII and XI, of which the variants have been"
206,PREFACE.,"noted in Vol. II of this edition, and a version of the lines _On the"
207,PREFACE.,"Death of Sir Samuel Romilly_ (p. 439), the stanzas entitled _Matilda_"
208,PREFACE.,(p. 516). A number of pages in pencil have been unavoidably disregarded.
209,PREFACE.,"In the same little book are a few fragmentary lines, hitherto unprinted,"
210,PREFACE.,that must originally have been intended to form part of the _Tales of
211,PREFACE.,the Hall_ (p. 473).
212,PREFACE.,
213,PREFACE.,"A fifth, also small, MS. book (U.P.) contains, besides a catalogue of"
214,PREFACE.,"Crabbe’s library at Trowbridge, and a few accounts, the two short pieces"
215,PREFACE.,printed in the present volume under the titles _Momentary Grief_ (p.
216,PREFACE.,507) and _Enigma_ (_Sovereign_) (p. 515). A number of pages at the end
217,PREFACE.,of this volume have been cut out.
218,PREFACE.,
219,PREFACE.,"Through the kind offices of the Vice-Master of Trinity College,"
220,PREFACE.,"Cambridge, Mr W. Aldis Wright, I was allowed to examine a MS. volume in"
221,PREFACE.,the Trinity Library (T.C.) which bears the following inscription: “This
222,PREFACE.,"volume, which formerly belonged to Crabbe the poet was given to the"
223,PREFACE.,"Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, by Edward FitzGerald, M.A.,"
224,PREFACE.,"April, 1871.” The obverse of the volume contains a list of Plants,"
225,PREFACE.,"beginning with _Cryptogamia_. On a fly-leaf are written, in a tremulous"
226,PREFACE.,"hand (probably Crabbe’s), the lines which I have entitled _A Fragment_"
227,PREFACE.,"(p. 497). Then follow, in Crabbe’s ordinary writing, the lines printed"
228,PREFACE.,in the present volume under the title of _Poverty and Love_ (_ib._); and
229,PREFACE.,"towards the end of the book, are, in Crabbe’s handwriting, the lines"
230,PREFACE.,here called _The Curate’s Progress_ (_ib._). The reverse of this MS.
231,PREFACE.,"book, which is on the cover very neatly dated September 23, 1793,"
232,PREFACE.,"contains, besides another shorter list of plants and much miscellaneous"
233,PREFACE.,"matter, a scribbled page of verse, from which I was only able to extract"
234,PREFACE.,the following entire couplet:
235,PREFACE.,
236,PREFACE.,“The Sum on Dress by this fair Creature spent
237,PREFACE.,Would more than equal Colin’s yearly rent.”
238,PREFACE.,
239,PREFACE.,"Professor E. Dowden, LL.D., of Trinity College, Dublin, has added to"
240,PREFACE.,previous obligations conferred on me in connexion with the present
241,PREFACE.,"edition by allowing me the use of two small books belonging to him, in"
242,PREFACE.,Crabbe’s handwriting (D.). One of these supplies the complete Tale of
243,PREFACE.,"_The Deserted Family_, now for the first time printed (pp. 477–488). The"
244,PREFACE.,other contains drafts of _Posthumous Tales_ VI-XVI and XXII; the more
245,PREFACE.,important variants offered by these are inserted in the list at the end
246,PREFACE.,of the present volume. From this MS. book are also taken the verses
247,PREFACE.,entitled _The Prodigal Going_ (p. 517).
248,PREFACE.,
249,PREFACE.,The originals of certain pieces contained in the present volume are to
250,PREFACE.,"be found in a book belonging to Mrs Mackay, of Trowbridge, which she has"
251,PREFACE.,with the utmost liberality placed at my service. This interesting
252,PREFACE.,portion of Mrs Mackay’s collection (M.) contains a series of
253,PREFACE.,"proof-engravings of Corbould’s, Westall’s and other illustrations of"
254,PREFACE.,certain among the earlier editions of Crabbe’s _Poems_. It also includes
255,PREFACE.,"a draft of a portion of _The Sisters_ (_Tales of the Hall_, Bk. VIII;"
256,PREFACE.,"see Vol. II, and variants, _ib._), and the lines _To Lady Jersey_ (p."
257,PREFACE.,"435), in a version, of which the variants have been duly noted. From"
258,PREFACE.,this book are taken the following poems: the stanzas called by me _The
259,PREFACE.,"Flowers of the Spring_ (p. 508), of which I have ventured to transpose"
260,PREFACE.,"the last two, and the fragment which I have named _La Belle Dame sans"
261,PREFACE.,Merci_ (p. 509). Both pieces are here printed for the first time. Mrs
262,PREFACE.,"Mackay’s collection also contains, written on separate leaves, the"
263,PREFACE.,"blank-verse lines entitled by me _The Passionate Pilgrim_ (p. 496),"
264,PREFACE.,"which are subscribed “Crabbe,” and of which the handwriting in several"
265,PREFACE.,respects resembles that in Crabbe’s autograph of _Midnight_ (see Vol.
266,PREFACE.,"I), though less flowing than this; the couplets called by me _Sorrow_"
267,PREFACE.,"(p. 496), which are not in the handwriting of Crabbe; and, finally, the"
268,PREFACE.,"lines _To the Hon. Mrs Spencer_ (p. 503), which are signed “Geo."
269,PREFACE.,Crabbe.”
270,PREFACE.,
271,PREFACE.,Mr Buxton-Forman has most generously allowed me to print a series of
272,PREFACE.,pieces from his collection of MSS. (B.F.). It includes the verses which
273,PREFACE.,"are entirely in Crabbe’s handwriting, as is perhaps the signature"
274,PREFACE.,"appended, and which I have called _Hopeless Love_ (p. 510); the fragment"
275,PREFACE.,"_David Jones_ (p. 476) of which the text may be, the title is certainly"
276,PREFACE.,"not, in Crabbe’s hand; and the fragment which I have called _Robert and"
277,PREFACE.,"Catharine_ (p. 475), as to which it seems uncertain whether the text is"
278,PREFACE.,in Crabbe’s hand. It is manifestly an early draft of _The Cousins_
279,PREFACE.,"(_Posthumous Tales_, XXI); but the actual phraseology in the two"
280,PREFACE.,versions is very rarely the same. The following pieces are also derived
281,PREFACE.,from the same collection: those called by me _Union_ (p. 511) and
282,PREFACE.,"_Revival_ (_ib._), of which latter the third stanza appears in a rather"
283,PREFACE.,different form on a separate leaf; _Metamorphosis_ (p. 512); and
284,PREFACE.,"_Contentment_ (p. 493), a fragment of a tale. Mr Buxton-Forman’s Crabbe"
285,PREFACE.,MSS. also include memoranda for Tales and drafts of parts of _The Will_
286,PREFACE.,"(_Posthumous Tales_, XX) and of _Belinda Waters_ (_ib._ XV). In neither"
287,PREFACE.,case are the variants offered by these drafts of importance.
288,PREFACE.,
289,PREFACE.,"Finally, the late Duke of Rutland was so kind as to allow several pieces"
290,PREFACE.,of verse in Crabbe’s own handwriting preserved at Belvoir to be
291,PREFACE.,"transcribed for insertion in the present edition (B). Some of these, I"
292,PREFACE.,"cannot but think, were transcribed by the Duke’s own hand. Most of them"
293,PREFACE.,were exhibited at the Crabbe Celebration held at Aldborough in
294,PREFACE.,"September, 1905, and successfully arranged and organised by Mr Charles"
295,PREFACE.,"Ganz. The _Verses to the Duke of Rutland_ dated Belvoir, August, 1784,"
296,PREFACE.,were most kindly transcribed for me after the death of the late Duke by
297,PREFACE.,"his Grace’s Chaplain and Librarian, the Rev. F. W. Knox. Of these"
298,PREFACE.,"pieces, the _Verses written for the Duke of Rutland’s Birthday_"
299,PREFACE.,"(_January 4, 1817_) (p. 499) and the lines entitled _La Femme Jalouse_"
300,PREFACE.,(_Teniers_) (p. 507) are here printed for the first time; to the latter
301,PREFACE.,a few variants have been furnished from an earlier copy in one of the
302,PREFACE.,MS. books in the possession of the University Press (U.P.). The stanzas
303,PREFACE.,"For _the Drawing of the Lady in the Green Mantle_ (p. 520), and"
304,PREFACE.,"_Brompton Park Cottage_ (p. 506), are also printed for the first time,"
305,PREFACE.,"from transcripts made by the late Duke of Rutland, or by his Grace’s"
306,PREFACE.,"instructions, from the originals at Belvoir. In the former case the"
307,PREFACE.,original states the “Fair Artist” who drew the picture to have been Miss
308,PREFACE.,Isabella Forrester. In the latter the drawing in question is stated to
309,PREFACE.,"have been made by Lady Sophia Norman, the cottage having been lent to"
310,PREFACE.,"the Duke, when ill, by Mr Greenwood. In the former case the last three"
311,PREFACE.,"stanzas, and in the latter a few various readings, have been supplied"
312,PREFACE.,from one of the Crabbe MS. books in the possession of the Cambridge
313,PREFACE.,"University Press (U.P.). To the lines _From Belvoir Castle_ (p. 389),"
314,PREFACE.,"_Storm and Calm_ (p. 396), and _To Sarah, Countess of Jersey, on her"
315,PREFACE.,"Birthday_ (p. 435), previously printed in the 1834 edition, variants"
316,PREFACE.,have been supplied from the Duke’s transcripts.
317,PREFACE.,
318,PREFACE.,Of the _Miscellaneous Verses previously printed_ reprinted in the
319,PREFACE.,"present volume the two _Poetical Epistles_ (April, 1780) are, by the"
320,PREFACE.,"kind permission of Mr Buxton-Forman, owner of the MSS., and of Dr W."
321,PREFACE.,"Robertson Nicoll and Mr T. J. Wise, editors of _Literary Anecdotes of"
322,PREFACE.,"the Nineteenth Century_ (1896), and of Messrs Hodder and Stoughton,"
323,PREFACE.,reproduced at length from Vol. II of that work. Ten lines from the
324,PREFACE.,_Epistle to Mira_ had already been printed in Vol. I (p. 67) from the
325,PREFACE.,_Life_ (p. 58) in Vol. I of the 1834 edition.
326,PREFACE.,
327,PREFACE.,"From this edition also come, with the exception of the last but two and"
328,PREFACE.,"the last, all the remaining shorter pieces already published (some with"
329,PREFACE.,"variants, duly noted, from the University Press and Belvoir MSS., from"
330,PREFACE.,"the MSS. of Mrs Mackay, and from an article entitled _Treasure Trove_"
331,PREFACE.,"contributed by Miss M. Jourdain to _The Book Monthly_ for May, 1906)."
332,PREFACE.,"This article, of which Miss Jourdain and her publishers (Messrs Simpkin,"
333,PREFACE.,"Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co.) kindly allowed me to make use, consists"
334,PREFACE.,of pieces printed from transcripts made at Belvoir Castle. In Miss
335,PREFACE.,Jourdain’s article is included stanza v of _The Friend in Love_ (p.
336,PREFACE.,"437), which is missing in the stanzas given in the _Life_ (1834). A few"
337,PREFACE.,variants in this version have been duly noted. I may add that between
338,PREFACE.,_The World of Dreams_ and _Sir Eustace Grey_ which in metre and
339,PREFACE.,"otherwise are so closely associated with one another, no actual"
340,PREFACE.,parallelisms either of sense or of form are noticeable. The exceptions
341,PREFACE.,"referred to are the following. _The Lines_ (_Edinburgh, August 15,"
342,PREFACE.,"1822_) (p. 440) are printed, without variants, from a separately printed"
343,PREFACE.,leaflet in my possession: and the _Lines addressed to the Dowager
344,PREFACE.,"Duchess of Rutland_ (p. 441) from _The Casket_ (1829), with variants"
345,PREFACE.,from Miss Jourdain’s article in _The Book Monthly_.
346,PREFACE.,
347,PREFACE.,_Of the Poems hitherto unpublished_ a list giving the source of each
348,PREFACE.,will be found at the close of the Bibliography in this volume. In the
349,PREFACE.,general sequence of these pieces I have so far as possible adopted a
350,PREFACE.,chronological order; the whole body of previously unpublished verse has
351,PREFACE.,"however been divided into two groups—viz. tales and fragments of tales,"
352,PREFACE.,"and lyrical pieces; and, where there was no indication of date, the"
353,PREFACE.,poems taken from the same collection of MSS. have been kept together.
354,PREFACE.,
355,PREFACE.,It remains for me to return my sincere thanks to the possessors of
356,PREFACE.,"Crabbe MSS. already mentioned, and to others who have in various ways"
357,PREFACE.,"aided me in making this concluding volume of Crabbe’s _Poems_, and"

680,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And hunt for votes to prop the fav’rite side?”
681,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“More private duty call’d me hence, to pay"
682,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"My friends respect on a rejoicing day,”"
683,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Replied the rector; “there is born a son,"
684,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Pride of an ancient race, who pray’d for one,"
685,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And long desponded. Would you hear the tale—
686,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Ask, and ’tis granted—of Sir Owen Dale?”      30"
687,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Grant,” said the Brothers, “for we humbly ask;"
688,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Ours be the gratitude, and thine the task."
689,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Yet dine we first; then to this tale of thine,"
690,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"As to thy sermon, seriously incline;"
691,_SIR OWEN DALE._,In neither case our rector shall complain
692,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Of this recited, that composed, in vain."
693,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Something we heard of vengeance, who appall’d,"
694,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Like an infernal spirit, him who call’d,"
695,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, ere he vanished, would perform his part,"
696,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Inflicting tortures on the wounded heart.      40
697,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Of this but little from report we know;
698,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"If you the progress of revenge can show,"
699,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Give it, and all its horrors, if you please;"
700,_SIR OWEN DALE._,We hear our neighbour’s sufferings much at ease.
701,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“Is it not so? For do not men delight—      }
702,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"We call them men—our bruisers to excite,      }"
703,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And urge with bribing gold, and feed them for the fight?      }"
704,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Men beyond common strength, of giant size,"
705,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And threat’ning terrors in each other’s eyes;
706,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When in their naked, native force display’d,      50"
707,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Look answers look, affrighting and afraid;"
708,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"While skill, like spurs and feeding, gives the arm"
709,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The wicked power to do the greater harm.
710,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Maim’d in the strife, the falling man sustains"
711,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Th’ insulting shout, that aggravates his pains—"
712,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Man can bear this; and shall thy hearers heed
713,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A tale of human sufferings? Come! proceed.”
714,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Thus urged, the worthy rector thought it meet"
715,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Some moral truth, as preface, to repeat;"
716,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Reflection serious—common-place, ’tis true;      60}"
717,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But he would act as he was wont to do,      }"
718,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And bring his morals in his neighbour’s view.      }
719,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“O! how the passions, insolent and strong,"
720,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Bear our weak minds their rapid course along;
721,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Make us the madness of their will obey;
722,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then die, and leave us to our griefs a prey!”"
723,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Sir Owen Dale his fortieth year had seen,"
724,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"With temper placid, and with mind serene;"
725,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Rich, early married to an easy wife,"
726,_SIR OWEN DALE._,They led in comfort a domestic life.      70
727,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He took of his affairs a prudent care,"
728,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And was by early habit led to spare;
729,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Not as a miser, but in pure good taste,"
730,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That scorn’d the idle wantonness of waste.
731,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In fact, the lessons he from prudence took"
732,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Were written in his mind, as in a book:"
733,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"There what to do he read, and what to shun;"
734,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And all commanded was with promptness done;
735,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He seem’d without a passion to proceed,"
736,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Or one whose passions no correction need.      80
737,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Yet some believed those passions only slept,"
738,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And were in bounds by early habits kept;
739,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Curb’d as they were by fetters worn so long,"
740,_SIR OWEN DALE._,There were who judged them a rebellious throng.
741,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To these he stood, not as a hero true,"
742,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Who fought his foes, and in the combat slew,"
743,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But one who all those foes, when sleeping, found,"
744,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, unresisted, at his pleasure bound."
745,_SIR OWEN DALE._,We thought—for I was one—that we espied
746,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Some indications strong of dormant pride:      90
747,_SIR OWEN DALE._,It was his wish in peace with all to live;
748,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And he could pardon, but could not forgive;"
749,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Nay, there were times when stern defiance shook"
750,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The moral man, and threaten’d in his look."
751,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Should these fierce passions—so we reason’d—break
752,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Their long-worn chain, what ravage will they make!"
753,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In vain will prudence then contend with pride,"
754,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And reason vainly bid revenge subside;
755,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Anger will not to meek persuasion bend,"
756,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor to the pleas of hope or fear attend;      100
757,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"What curb shall, then, in their disorder’d race,      }"
758,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Check the wild passions? what the calm replace?      }
759,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Virtue shall strive in vain; and has he help in grace?      }
760,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"While yet the wife with pure discretion ruled,"
761,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The man was guided, and the mind was school’d;"
762,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But then that mind unaided ran to waste:
763,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He had some learning, but he wanted taste;"
764,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Placid, not pleased—contented, not employ’d—"
765,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He neither time improved, nor life enjoy’d."
766,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"That wife expired, and great the loss sustain’d,      110"
767,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Though much distress he neither felt nor feign’d:
768,_SIR OWEN DALE._,He loved not warmly; but the sudden stroke
769,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Deeply and strongly on his habits broke.
770,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He had no child to soothe him, and his farm,"
771,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His sports, his speculations, lost their charm;"
772,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then would he read and travel, would frequent"
773,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Life’s busy scenes; and forth Sir Owen went.
774,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The mind, that now was free, unfix’d, uncheck’d,"
775,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Read and observed with wonderful effect;
776,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And still, the more he gain’d, the more he long’d      120"
777,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To pay that mind his negligence had wrong’d;
778,_SIR OWEN DALE._,He felt his pleasures rise as he improved;
779,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, first enduring, then the labour loved."
780,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But, by the light let in, Sir Owen found"
781,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Some of those passions had their chain unbound;
782,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"As from a trance they rose to act their part,"
783,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And seize, as due to them, a feeling heart."
784,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His very person now appear’d refined,"
785,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And took some graces from th’ improving mind;
786,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He grew polite without a fix’d intent,      130"
787,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And to the world a willing pupil went.
788,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Restore him twenty years—restore him ten—
789,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And bright had been his earthly prospect then;
790,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But much refinement, when it late arrives,"
791,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"May be the grace, not comfort, of our lives."
792,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Now had Sir Owen feeling: things of late
793,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Indifferent he began to love or hate;
794,_SIR OWEN DALE._,What once could neither good nor ill impart
795,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Now pleased the senses, and now touch’d the heart;"
796,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Prospects and pictures struck th’ awaken’d sight,      140"
797,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And each new object gave a new delight.
798,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He, like th’ imperfect creature who had shaped"
799,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"A shroud to hide him, had at length escaped;"
800,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Changed from his grub-like state, to crawl no more,"
801,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But a wing’d being, pleased and form’d to soar."
802,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Now, said his friends, while thus his views improve,"
803,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And his mind softens, what if he should love?"
804,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"True; life with him has yet serene appear’d,"
805,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And therefore love in wisdom should be fear’d;
806,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Forty and five his years, and then to sigh      150"
807,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For beauty’s favour!—Son of frailty, fly!"
808,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Alas! he loved; it was our fear, but ours,"
809,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His friends’, alone. He doubted not his pow’rs"
810,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To win the prize, or to repel the charm,"
811,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To gain the battle, or escape the harm;"
812,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For he had never yet resistance proved,"
813,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor fear’d that friends should say—“Alas! he loved.”
814,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Younger by twenty years, Camilla found"
815,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Her face unrivall’d when she smiled or frown’d;
816,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Of all approved; in manner, form, and air,      160"
817,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Made to attract; gay, elegant, and fair."
818,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She had, in beauty’s aid, a fair pretence"
819,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To cultivated, strong intelligence;"
820,_SIR OWEN DALE._,For she a clear and ready mind had fed
821,_SIR OWEN DALE._,With wholesome food; unhurt by what she read.
822,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She loved to please; but, like her dangerous sex,"
823,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To please the more whom she design’d to vex.
824,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"This heard Sir Owen, and he saw it true;      }"
825,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"It promised pleasure, promised danger too;      }"
826,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But this he knew not then, or slighted if he knew.      170}"
827,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Yet he delay’d, and would by trials prove"
828,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That he was safe; would see the signs of love;
829,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Would not address her while a fear remain’d;
830,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But win his way, assured of what he gain’d."
831,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"This saw the lady, not displeased to find"
832,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A man at once so cautious and so blind;
833,_SIR OWEN DALE._,She saw his hopes that she would kindly show
834,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Proofs of her passion—then she his should know:
835,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“So, when my heart is bleeding in his sight,"
836,_SIR OWEN DALE._,His love acknowledged will the pains requite;      180
837,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"It is, when conquer’d, he the heart regards;"
838,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Well, good Sir Owen! let us play our cards.”"
839,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He spake her praise in terms that love affords,"
840,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"By words select, and looks surpassing words."
841,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Kindly she listen’d, and in turn essay’d"
842,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To pay th’ applauses—and she amply paid,"
843,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A beauty flattering!—beauteous flatterers feel
844,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The ill you cause, when thus in praise you deal;"
845,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For surely he is more than man, or less,"
846,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When praised by lips that he would die to press,      190"
847,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And yet his senses undisturb’d can keep,"
848,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Can calmly reason, or can soundly sleep."
849,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Not so Sir Owen; him Camilla praised,"
850,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And lofty hopes and strong emotions raised;
851,_SIR OWEN DALE._,This had alone the strength of man subdued;
852,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But this enchantress various arts pursued.
853,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Let others pray for music—others pray’d
854,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In vain; Sir Owen ask’d, and was obey’d;"
855,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Let others, walking, sue that arm to take—"
856,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Unmoved she kept it for Sir Owen’s sake;      200
857,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Each small request she granted, and though small,"
858,_SIR OWEN DALE._,He thought them pledges of her granting all.
859,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And now the lover, casting doubt aside,"
860,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Urged the fond suit that—could not be denied;
861,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Joy more than reverence moved him when he said;
862,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Now banish all my fears, angelic maid!”"
863,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, as she paused for words, he gaily cried,"
864,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“I must not, cannot, will not be denied.”"
865,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Ah! good Sir Owen, think not favours, such"
866,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"As artful maids allow, amount to much;      210"
867,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The sweet, small, poison’d baits, that take the eye"
868,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And win the soul of all who venture nigh.
869,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Camilla listen’d, paused, and look’d surprise,"
870,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Fair witch! exulting in her witcheries!
871,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She turn’d aside her face, withdrew her hand,"
872,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And softly said, “Sir, let me understand.”"
873,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Nay, my dear lady! what can words explain,"
874,_SIR OWEN DALE._,If all my looks and actions plead in vain?
875,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"I love”—She show’d a cool, respectful air;"
876,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And he began to falter in his prayer,      220"
877,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Yet urged her kindness—-Kindness she confess’d;
878,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"It was esteem; she felt it, and express’d,"
879,_SIR OWEN DALE._,For her dear father’s friend; and was it right
880,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That friend of his—she thought of hers—to slight?
881,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"This to the wond’ring lover strange and new,"
882,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And false appear’d—he would not think it true.
883,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Still he pursued the lovely prize, and still"
884,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Heard the cold words, design’d his hopes to kill;"
885,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He felt dismay’d, as he perceived success"
886,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Had inverse ratio, more obtaining less;      230"
887,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And still she grew more cool in her replies,"
888,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And talk’d of age and improprieties.
889,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then to his friends, although it hurt his pride,      }"
890,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And to the lady’s, he for aid applied;      }"
891,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Who kindly woo’d for him, but strongly were denied.      }"
892,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And now it was those fiercer passions rose,"
893,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Urged by his love to murder his repose;
894,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Shame shook his soul to be deceived so long,"
895,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And fierce revenge for such contemptuous wrong;
896,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Jealous he grew, and jealousy supplied      240}"
897,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His mind with rage, unsooth’d, unsatisfied;      }"
898,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And grievous were the pangs of deeply wounded pride.      }
899,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His generous soul had not the grief sustain’d,"
900,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Had he not thought, “revenge may be obtain’d.”"
901,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Camilla grieved, but grief was now too late;"
902,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She hush’d her fears, and left th’ event to fate.—"
903,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Four years elapsed, nor knew Sir Owen yet"
904,_SIR OWEN DALE._,How to repay the meditated debt;
905,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The lovely foe was in her thirtieth year,"
906,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor saw the favourite of the heart appear;      250
907,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"’Tis sure, less sprightly the fair nymph became,"
908,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And spoke of former levities with shame;
909,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But this, alas! was not in time confess’d,"
910,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And vengeance waited in Sir Owen’s breast.
911,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But now the time arrives—the maid must feel
912,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And grieve for wounds that she refused to heal.
913,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Sir Owen, childless, in his love had rear’d"
914,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A sister’s son; and now the youth appear’d
915,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In all the pride of manhood, and, beside,"
916,_SIR OWEN DALE._,With all a soldier’s spirit and his pride;      260
917,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Valiant and poor, with all that arms bestow,"
918,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And wants that captains in their quarters know;
919,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Yet to his uncle’s generous heart was due
920,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The praise, that wants of any kind were few."
921,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When he appear’d, Sir Owen felt a joy"
922,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Unknown before, his vengeance bless’d the boy—"
923,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“To him I dare confide a cause so just;
924,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Love him she may—O! could I say, she must!”"
925,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Thus fix’d, he more than usual kindness show’d,"
926,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor let the captain name the debt he owed;      270
927,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But when he spoke of gratitude, exclaim’d,"
928,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“My dearest Morden! make me not ashamed;
929,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Each for a friend should do the best he can,"
930,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The most obliged is the obliging man;
931,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But if you wish to give as well as take,"
932,_SIR OWEN DALE._,You may a debtor of your uncle make.”
933,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Morden was earnest in his wish to know
934,_SIR OWEN DALE._,How he could best his grateful spirit show.
935,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Now the third dinner had their powers renew’d,"
936,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And fruit and wine upon the table stood;      280
937,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The fire brought comfort, and the warmth it lent"
938,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A cheerful spirit to the feelings sent;
939,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When thus the uncle—“Morden, I depend"
940,_SIR OWEN DALE._,On you for aid—assist me as a friend:
941,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Full well I know that you would much forego,"
942,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And much endure, to wreak me on my foe."
943,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Charles, I am wrong’d, insulted—nay, be still,"
944,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor look so fiercely—there are none to kill.
945,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“I loved a lady, somewhat late in life,"
946,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Perhaps too late, and would have made a wife;      290"
947,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Nay, she consented; for consent I call"
948,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The mark’d distinction that was seen of all,"
949,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And long was seen; but when she knew my pain,"
950,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Saw my first wish her favour to obtain,"
951,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And ask her hand—no sooner was it ask’d,"
952,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Than she the lovely Jezebel unmask’d;
953,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And by her haughty airs, and scornful pride,"
954,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"My peace was wounded—nay, my reason tried;"
955,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"I felt despised and fallen when we met,"
956,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And she, O folly! looks too lovely yet;      300"
957,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Yet love no longer in my bosom glows,"
958,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But my heart warms at the revenge it owes.
959,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“O! that I saw her with her soul on fire,"
960,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Desperate from love, and sickening with desire;"
961,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"While all beheld her just, unpitied pain,"
962,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Grown in neglect, and sharpen’d by disdain!"
963,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Let her be jealous of each maid she sees,      }"
964,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Striving by every fruitless art to please,      }"
965,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And when she fondly looks, let looks and fondness tease!      }"
966,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"So, lost on passion’s never resting sea,      310"
967,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Hopeless and helpless, let her think of me!"
968,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Charles, thou art handsome, nor canst want the art"
969,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To warm a cold or win a wanton heart;
970,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Be my avenger”——
971,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Charles, with smile, not vain,"
972,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Nor quite unmix’d with pity and disdain,"
973,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Sate mute in wonder; but he sate not long
974,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Without reflection:—“Was Sir Owen wrong?
975,_SIR OWEN DALE._,So must I think; for can I judge it right
976,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To treat a lovely lady with despite,"
977,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Because she play’d too roughly with the love      320
978,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Of a fond man whom she could not approve?
979,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And yet, to vex him for the love he bore"
980,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Is cause enough for his revenge, and more."
981,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“But, thoughts, to council!—Do I wear a charm"
982,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That will preserve my citadel from harm?
983,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Like the good knight, I have a heart that feels"
984,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The wounds that beauty makes and kindness heals:
985,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Beauty she has, it seems, but is not kind—"
986,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"So found Sir Owen, and so I may find."
987,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Yet why, O! heart of tinder, why afraid?      330"
988,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Comes so much danger from so fair a maid?
989,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Wilt thou be made a voluntary prize
990,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To the fierce firing of two wicked eyes?
991,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Think her a foe, and on the danger rush,"
992,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor let thy kindred for a coward blush.
993,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“But how if this fair creature should incline
994,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To think too highly of this love of mine,"
995,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, taking all my counterfeit address"
996,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For sterling passion, should the like profess?"
997,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Nay, this is folly; or, if I perceive      340"
998,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Ought of the kind, I can but take my leave;"
999,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And if the heart should feel a little sore,"
1000,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Contempt and anger will its ease restore.
1001,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Then, too, to his all-bounteous hand I owe"
1002,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"All I possess, and almost all I know;"
1003,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And shall I for my friend no hazard run,"
1004,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Who seeks no more for all his love has done?
1005,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“’Tis but to meet and bow, to talk and smile,"
1006,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To act a part, and put on love awhile;"
1007,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And the good knight shall see, this trial made,      350"
1008,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That I have just his talents to persuade;
1009,_SIR OWEN DALE._,For why the lady should her heart bestow      }
1010,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"On me, or I of her enamour’d grow,      }"
1011,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"There’s none can reason give, there’s none can danger show.”      }"
1012,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"These were his rapid thoughts, and then he spoke."
1013,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“I make a promise, and will not revoke;"
1014,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"You are my judge in what is fit and right,"
1015,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And I obey you—bid me love or fight;
1016,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Yet had I rather, so the act could meet"
1017,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"With your concurrence, not to play the cheat;      360"
1018,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In a fair cause”——“Charles, fighting for your king,"
1019,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Did you e’er judge the merits of the thing?
1020,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Show me a monarch who has cause like mine,"
1021,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And yet what soldier would his cause decline?”
1022,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Poor Charles or saw not, or refused to see,"
1023,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"How weak the reasoning of our hopes may be,"
1024,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And said—“Dear uncle, I my king obey’d,"
1025,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And for his glory’s sake the soldier play’d;
1026,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Now a like duty shall your nephew rule,"
1027,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And for your vengeance I will play the fool.”      370
1028,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"’Twas well; but ere they parted for repose,"
1029,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A solemn oath must the engagement close.
1030,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Swear to me, nephew, from the day you meet"
1031,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"This cruel girl, there shall be no deceit;"
1032,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That by all means approved and used by man
1033,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"You win this dangerous woman, if you can;"
1034,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"That, being won, you my commands obey,"
1035,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Leave her lamenting, and pursue your way;"
1036,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And that, as in my business, you will take"
1037,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"My will as guide, and no resistance make:      380"
1038,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Take now an oath—within the volume look,"
1039,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"There is the Gospel—swear, and kiss the book.”"
1040,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“It cannot be,” thought Charles, “he cannot rest"
1041,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In this strange humour—it is all a jest,"
1042,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"All but dissimulation—Well, sir, there;"
1043,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Now I have sworn as you would have me swear.”
1044,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“’Tis well,” the uncle said in solemn tone;"
1045,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Now send me vengeance, Fate, and groan for groan!”"
1046,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The time is come: the soldier now must meet
1047,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Th’ unconscious object of the sworn deceit.      390
1048,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"They meet; each other’s looks the pair explore,"
1049,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, such their fortune, wish’d to part no more."
1050,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Whether a man is thus disposed to break
1051,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"An evil compact he was forced to make,"
1052,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Or whether some contention in the breast
1053,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Will not permit a feeling heart to rest;
1054,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Or was it nature, who in every case"
1055,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Has made such mind subjected to such face:
1056,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Whate’er the cause, no sooner met the pair"
1057,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Than both began to love, and one to feel despair.      400"
1058,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But the fair damsel saw with strong delight
1059,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Th’ impression made, and gloried in the sight."
1060,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"No chilling doubt alarm’d her tender breast,"
1061,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But she rejoiced in all his looks profess’d;
1062,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Long ere his words her lover’s hopes convey’d,"
1063,_SIR OWEN DALE._,They warm’d the bosom of the conscious maid;
1064,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"One spirit seem’d each nature to inspire,"
1065,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And the two hearts were fix’d in one desire.
1066,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Now,” thought the courteous maid, “my father’s friend"
1067,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Will ready pardon to my fault extend;      410
1068,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He shall no longer lead that hermit’s life,"
1069,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But love his mistress in his nephew’s wife;
1070,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"My humble duty shall his anger kill,      }"
1071,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And I who fled his love will meet his will,      }"
1072,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Prevent his least desire, and every wish fulfil.”      }"
1073,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Hail, happy power! that to the present lends"
1074,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Such views; not all on Fortune’s wheel depends:
1075,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Hope, fair enchantress, drives each cloud away,"
1076,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And now enjoys the glad, but distant, day."
1077,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Still fears ensued; for love produces fear.—      420
1078,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“To this dear maid can I indeed be dear?
1079,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"My fatal oath, alas! I now repent;"
1080,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Stern in his purpose, he will not relent;"
1081,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Would, ere that oath, I had Camilla seen!"
1082,_SIR OWEN DALE._,I had not then my honour’s victim been;
1083,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"I must be honest, yet I know not how,"
1084,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"’Tis crime to break, and death to keep my vow.”"
1085,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Sir Owen closely watch’d both maid and man,"
1086,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And saw with joy proceed his cruel plan;
1087,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Then gave his praise—“She has it—has it deep      430}
1088,_SIR OWEN DALE._,In her capricious heart—it murders sleep;      }
1089,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"You see the looks that grieve, you see the eyes that weep;      }"
1090,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Now breathe again, dear youth, the kindling fire,"
1091,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And let her feel what she could once inspire.”
1092,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Alas! obedience was an easy task,"
1093,_SIR OWEN DALE._,So might he cherish what he meant to ask;
1094,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He ventured soon, for Love prepared his way,"
1095,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He sought occasion, he forbad delay;"
1096,_SIR OWEN DALE._,In spite of vow foregone he taught the youth
1097,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The looks of passion, and the words of truth;      440"
1098,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In spite of woman’s caution, doubt, and fear,"
1099,_SIR OWEN DALE._,He bade her credit all she wish’d to hear;
1100,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"An honest passion ruled in either breast,"
1101,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And both believed the truth that both profess’d.
1102,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But now, ’mid all her new-born hopes, the eyes"
1103,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Of fair Camilla saw through all disguise,"
1104,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Reserve, and apprehension—Charles, who now"
1105,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Grieved for his duty, and abhorr’d his vow,"
1106,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Told the full fact, and it endear’d him more;"
1107,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She felt her power, and pardon’d all he swore,      450"
1108,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Since to his vow he could his wish prefer,"
1109,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And loved the man who gave his world for her.
1110,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"What must they do, and how their work begin,"
1111,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Can they that temper to their wishes win?
1112,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"They tried, they fail’d; and all they did t’ assuage"
1113,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The tempest of his soul provoked his rage;
1114,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The uncle met the youth with angry look,"
1115,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And cried, “Remember, sir, the oath you took;"
1116,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"You have my pity, Charles, but nothing more,"
1117,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Death, and death only, shall her peace restore;      460"
1118,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And am I dying?—I shall live to view
1119,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The harlot’s sorrow, and enjoy it too."
1120,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“How! Words offend you? I have borne for years
1121,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Unheeded anguish, shed derided tears,"
1122,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Felt scorn in every look, endured the stare"
1123,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Of wondering fools, who never felt a care;"
1124,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"On me all eyes were fix’d, and I the while"
1125,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Sustain’d the insult of a rival’s smile.
1126,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“And shall I now—entangled thus my foe—
1127,_SIR OWEN DALE._,My honest vengeance for a boy forego?      470
1128,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"A boy forewarn’d, forearm’d? Shall this be borne,"
1129,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And I be cheated, Charles, and thou forsworn?"
1130,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Hope not, I say, for thou mayst change as well      }"
1131,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The sentence graven on the gates of hell—      }
1132,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Here bid adieu to hope—here hopeless beings dwell.      }
1133,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“But does she love thee, Charles? I cannot live"
1134,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Dishonour’d, unrevenged—I may forgive,"
1135,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But to thy oath I bind thee; on thy soul
1136,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Seek not my injured spirit to control;
1137,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Seek not to soften; I am hard of heart,      480}"
1138,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Harden’d by insult:—leave her now, and part,      }"
1139,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And let me know she grieves while I enjoy her smart.”      }
1140,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Charles first in anger to the knight replied,"
1141,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then felt the clog upon his soul, and sigh’d:"
1142,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To his obedience made his wishes stoop,"
1143,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And now admitted, now excluded hope;"
1144,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"As lovers do, he saw a prospect fair,"
1145,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And then so dark, he sank into despair."
1146,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The uncle grieved; he even told the youth
1147,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"That he was sorry, and it seem’d a truth;      490"
1148,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But, though it vex’d, it varied not his mind;"
1149,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He bound himself, and would his nephew bind."
1150,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“I told him this, placed danger in his view,"
1151,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Bade him be certain, bound him to be true;"
1152,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And shall I now my purposes reject,"
1153,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Because my warnings were of no effect?”
1154,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Thus felt Sir Owen as a man whose cause
1155,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Is very good—it had his own applause.
1156,_SIR OWEN DALE._,
1157,_SIR OWEN DALE._,*       *       *       *       *
1158,_SIR OWEN DALE._,
1159,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Our knight a tenant had in high esteem,"
1160,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His constant boast, when justice was his theme:      500"
1161,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He praised the farmer’s sense, his shrewd discourse,"
1162,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Free without rudeness, manly, and not coarse;"
1163,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"As farmer, tenant, nay, as man, the knight"
1164,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Thought Ellis all that is approved and right.
1165,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then he was happy, and some envy drew,"
1166,_SIR OWEN DALE._,For knowing more than other farmers knew;
1167,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"They call’d him learned, and it sooth’d their pride,"
1168,_SIR OWEN DALE._,While he in his was pleased and gratified.
1169,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Still more t’ offend, he to the altar led"
1170,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The vicar’s niece, to early reading bred;      510"
1171,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Who, though she freely ventured on the life,"
1172,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Could never fully be the farmer’s wife;
1173,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She had a softness, gentleness, and ease,"
1174,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Sure a coarse mind to humble and displease.
1175,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"O! had she never known a fault beside,"
1176,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"How vain their spite, how impotent their pride!"
1177,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Three darling girls the happy couple bless’d,"
1178,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Who now the sweetest lot of life possess’d;
1179,_SIR OWEN DALE._,For what can more a grateful spirit move
1180,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Than health, with competence, and peace, with love?      520"
1181,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Ellis would sometimes, thriving man! retire"
1182,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To the town inn, and quit the parlour fire;"
1183,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But he was ever kind where’er he went,      }"
1184,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And trifling sums in his amusements spent;      }
1185,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He bought, he thought, for her—she should have been content.      }"
1186,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Oft, when he cash received at Smithfield mart,"
1187,_SIR OWEN DALE._,At Cranbourn-alley he would leave a part;
1188,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, if to town he follow’d what he sold,"
1189,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Sure was his wife a present to behold.
1190,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Still, when his evenings at the inn were spent,      530"
1191,_SIR OWEN DALE._,She mused at home in sullen discontent;
1192,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, sighing, yielded to a wish that some"
1193,_SIR OWEN DALE._,With social spirit to the farm would come.
1194,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"There was a farmer in the place, whose name,"
1195,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And skill in rural arts, was known to fame;"
1196,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He had a pupil, by his landlord sent,"
1197,_SIR OWEN DALE._,On terms that gave the parties much content:
1198,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The youth those arts, and those alone, should learn;"
1199,_SIR OWEN DALE._,With aught beside his guide had no concern.
1200,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He might to neighb’ring towns or distant ride,      540"
1201,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And there amusements seek without a guide;
1202,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"With handsome prints his private room was graced,      }"
1203,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His music there, and there his books were placed;      }"
1204,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Men knew not if he farm’d, but they allow’d him taste.      }"
1205,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Books, prints, and music, cease, at times, to charm,"
1206,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And sometimes men can neither ride nor farm;
1207,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"They look for kindred minds, and Cecil found,"
1208,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In Farmer Ellis, one inform’d and sound;"
1209,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But in his wife—I hate the fact I tell—
1210,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"A lovely being, who could please too well;      550"
1211,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And he was one who never would deny
1212,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Himself a pleasure, or indeed would try."
1213,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Early and well the wife of Ellis knew
1214,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Where danger was, and trembled at the view;"
1215,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"So evil spirits tremble, but are still"
1216,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Evil, and lose not the rebellious will."
1217,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She sought not safety from the fancied crime,"
1218,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“And why retreat before the dangerous time?”
1219,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Oft came the student of the farm and read,"
1220,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And found his mind with more than reading fed:      560
1221,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"This Ellis seeing, left them, or he staid,"
1222,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"As pleased him, not offended nor afraid:"
1223,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He came in spirits with his girls to play,"
1224,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then ask excuse, and, laughing, walk away:"
1225,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When, as he entered, Cecil ceased to read,"
1226,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He would exclaim, “Proceed, my friend, proceed!”"
1227,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Or, sometimes weary, would to bed retire,"
1228,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And fear and anger by his ease inspire.
1229,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“My conversation does he then despise?
1230,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Leaves he this slighted face for other eyes?”      570
1231,_SIR OWEN DALE._,So said Alicia; and she dwelt so long
1232,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Upon that thought, to leave her was to wrong."
1233,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Alas! the woman loved the soothing tongue,"
1234,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That yet pronounced her beautiful and young;
1235,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The tongue that, seeming careless, ever praised;"
1236,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The eye that, roving, on her person gazed;"
1237,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The ready service, on the watch to please;"
1238,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And all such sweet, small courtesies as these."
1239,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Still there was virtue, but a rolling stone"
1240,_SIR OWEN DALE._,On a hill’s brow is not more quickly gone;      580
1241,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The slightest motion—ceasing from our care—
1242,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A moment’s absence—when we’re not aware—
1243,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When down it rolls, and at the bottom lies,"
1244,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Sunk, lost, degraded, never more to rise!"
1245,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Far off the glorious height from whence it fell,"
1246,_SIR OWEN DALE._,With all things base and infamous to dwell.
1247,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Friendship with woman is a dangerous thing—
1248,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Thence hopes avow’d and bold confessions spring;
1249,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Frailties confess’d to other frailties lead,"
1250,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And new confessions new desires succeed;      590
1251,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, when the friends have thus their hearts disclosed,"
1252,_SIR OWEN DALE._,They find how little is to guilt opposed.
1253,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The foe’s attack will on the fort begin,"
1254,_SIR OWEN DALE._,When he is certain of a friend within.
1255,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When all was lost—or, in the lover’s sight,"
1256,_SIR OWEN DALE._,When all was won—the lady thought of flight.
1257,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“What! sink a slave?” she said, “and with deceit"
1258,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The rigid virtue of a husband meet?
1259,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"No! arm’d with death, I would his fury brave,"
1260,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And own the justice of the blow he gave!      600
1261,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But thus to see him easy, careless, cold,"
1262,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And his confiding folly to behold;
1263,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To feel incessant fears that he should read,"
1264,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In looks assumed, the cause whence they proceed,"
1265,_SIR OWEN DALE._,I cannot brook; nor will I here abide
1266,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Till chance betrays the crime that shame would hide.
1267,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Fly with me, Henry!” Henry sought in vain"
1268,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To soothe her terrors and her griefs restrain;
1269,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He saw the lengths that women dared to go,"
1270,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And fear’d the husband both as friend and foe.      610
1271,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Of farming weary—for the guilty mind
1272,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Can no resource in guiltless studies find—
1273,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Left to himself, his mother all unknown,"
1274,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"His titled father, loth the boy to own,"
1275,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Had him to decent expectations bred,"
1276,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A favour’d offspring of a lawless bed;
1277,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And would he censure one who should pursue
1278,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The way he took? Alicia yet was new;
1279,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Her passion pleased him; he agreed on flight;
1280,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"They fix’d the method, and they chose the night.      620"
1281,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then, while the farmer read of public crimes,"
1282,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Collating coolly [Chronicle] and Times,"
1283,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The flight was taken by the guilty pair,"
1284,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That made one passage in the columns there.
1285,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The heart of Ellis bled; the comfort, pride,"
1286,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The hope and stay of his existence, died;"
1287,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Rage from the ruin of his peace arose,"
1288,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And he would follow and destroy his foes;
1289,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Would with wild haste the guilty pair pursue,"
1290,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And when he found—Good heaven? what would he do?      630

1295,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Bring death in view, and then the stroke suspend,"
1296,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And draw out tortures till his life should end;

1299,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In this bad world should all his business cease,"
1300,_SIR OWEN DALE._,He would not seek—he would not taste of peace;      640
1301,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But wrath should live till vengeance had her due,"
1302,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And with his wrath his life should perish too.
1303,_SIR OWEN DALE._,His girls—not his—he would not be so weak—
1304,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Child was a word he never more must speak!
1305,_SIR OWEN DALE._,How did he know what villains had defiled
1306,_SIR OWEN DALE._,His honest bed?—He spurn’d the name of child:
1307,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Keep them he must; but he would coarsely hide
1308,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Their forms, and nip the growth of woman’s pride;"
1309,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He would consume their flesh, abridge their food,"
1310,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And kill the mother-vices in their blood.      650

1316,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But urged the vengeance with a spirit strong,"
1317,_SIR OWEN DALE._,As one whose own rose high against the wrong.
1318,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He saw his tenant by this passion moved,"
1319,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Shared in his wrath, and his revenge approved."
1320,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Years now unseen, he mourn’d this tenant’s fate,"
1321,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And wonder’d how he bore his widow’d state;
1322,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Still he would mention Ellis with the pride
1323,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Of one who felt himself to worth allied.      660
1324,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Such were his notions—had been long, but now"
1325,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"He wish’d to see if vengeance lived, and how;"

1331,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"One scorn’d and hated, lost and perish’d one."
1332,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Yes, he would praise to virtuous anger give,"

1337,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Where she was wont in happier days to sit,"
1338,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Who paid with smiles his condescending wit.
1339,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"There the sad husband, who had seldom been"
1340,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Where prints acquired in happier days were seen,"
1341,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Now struck by these, and carried to the past,"
1342,_SIR OWEN DALE._,A painful look on every object cast.
1343,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Sir Owen saw his tenant’s troubled state,      680"
1344,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But still he wish’d to know the offenders’ fate.
1345,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Know you they suffer, Ellis?”—Ellis knew;"
1346,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“’Tis well! ’tis just! but have they all their due?
1347,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Have they in mind and body, head and heart,"
1348,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Sustain’d the pangs of their accursed part!”—
1349,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“They have!”—“’Tis well!”—“and wants enough to shake
1350,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The firmest mind, the stoutest heart to break.”—"
1351,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“But have you seen them in such misery dwell?”—
1352,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“In misery past description.”—“That is well.”
1353,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Alas! Sir Owen, it perhaps is just;      690"
1354,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Yet I began my purpose to distrust;
1355,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For they to justice have discharged a debt,"
1356,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That vengeance surely may her claim forget.”—
1357,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Man, can you pity?”—"
1358,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“As a man I feel
1359,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Miseries like theirs.”—
1360,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“But never would you heal?”—
1361,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Hear me, Sir Owen:—I had sought them long,"
1362,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Urged by the pain of ever present wrong,"
1363,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Yet had not seen; and twice the year came round—
1364,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Years hateful now—ere I my victims found.
1365,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But I did find them, in the dungeon’s gloom      700"
1366,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Of a small garret—a precarious home;
1367,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For that depended on the weekly pay,"
1368,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And they were sorely frighten’d on the day.
1369,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But there they linger’d on from week to week,"
1370,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Haunted by ills of which ’tis hard to speak;
1371,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For they are many and vexatious all,"
1372,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The very smallest—but they none were small.
1373,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“The roof, unceil’d in patches, gave the snow"

1377,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, when I enter’d, misery met my view      }"
1378,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In every shape she wears, in every hue,      }"
1379,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And the bleak icy blast across the dungeon flew;      }
1380,_SIR OWEN DALE._,There frown’d the ruin’d walls that once were white;
1381,_SIR OWEN DALE._,There gleam’d the panes that once admitted light;
1382,_SIR OWEN DALE._,There lay unsavoury scraps of wretched food;
1383,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And there a measure, void of fuel, stood."
1384,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But who shall part by part describe the state
1385,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Of these, thus follow’d by relentless fate?      720"
1386,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"All, too, in winter, when the icy air"
1387,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Breathed its bleak venom on the guilty pair.
1388,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“That man, that Cecil!—he was left, it seems,"
1389,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Unnamed, unnoticed: farewell to his dreams!"
1390,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Heirs made by law rejected him of course,"
1391,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And left him neither refuge nor resource.—
1392,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Their father’s? No; he was the harlot’s son      }
1393,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Who wrong’d them, whom their duty bade them shun;      }"

1395,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Now the lost pair, whom better times had led      730"
1396,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To part disputing, shared their sorrow’s bed;"
1397,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Their bed!—I shudder as I speak—and shared
1398,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Scraps to their hunger by the hungry spared.”—
1399,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“Man! my good Ellis! can you sigh?”—“I can:
1400,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In short, Sir Owen, I must feel as man;"
1401,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And could you know the miseries they endured,"
1402,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The poor, uncertain pittance they procured;"
1403,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"When, laid aside the needle and the pen,"
1404,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Their sickness won the neighbours of their den,"
1405,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Poor as they are—and they are passing poor—      740
1406,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To lend some aid to those who needed more;
1407,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Then, too, an ague with the winter came;      }"
1408,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, in this state—that wife I cannot name      }"
1409,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Brought forth a famish’d child of suffering and of shame.      }
1410,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“This had you known, and traced them to this scene,"
1411,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Where all was desolate, defiled, unclean,"
1412,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"A fireless room, and, where a fire had place,"
1413,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The blast loud howling down the empty space—
1414,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"You must have felt a part of the distress,"
1415,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Forgot your wrongs, and made their suffering less!”—      750"
1416,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Sought you them, Ellis, from the mean intent"
1417,_SIR OWEN DALE._,To give them succour?”—
1418,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“What indeed I meant
1419,_SIR OWEN DALE._,At first was vengeance; but I long pursued
1420,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The pair, and I at last their misery view’d"
1421,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"In that vile garret, which I cannot paint—"
1422,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The sight was loathsome, and the smell was faint;"
1423,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And there that wife, whom I had loved so well,"
1424,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And thought so happy, was condemn’d to dwell;"
1425,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The gay, the grateful wife, whom I was glad"

1427,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And to behold among our neighbours fine,"
1428,_SIR OWEN DALE._,More than perhaps became a wife of mine:
1429,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And now among her neighbours to explore,"
1430,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And see her poorest of the very poor!—
1431,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"I would describe it, but I bore a part,"
1432,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Nor can explain the feelings of the heart;
1433,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Yet memory since has aided me to trace
1434,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The horrid features of that dismal place.
1435,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"There she reclined unmoved, her bosom bare"
1436,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To her companion’s unimpassion’d stare,      770"
1437,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And my wild wonder—Seat of virtue! chaste,"
1438,_SIR OWEN DALE._,As lovely once! O! how wert thou disgraced!
1439,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Upon that breast, by sordid rags defiled,"
1440,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Lay the wan features of a famish’d child;—
1441,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"That sin-born babe in utter misery laid,"
1442,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Too feebly wretched even to cry for aid;
1443,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The ragged sheeting, o’er her person drawn,"
1444,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Served for the dress that hunger placed in pawn.
1445,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“At the bed’s feet the man reclined his frame;
1446,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Their chairs were perish’d to support the flame      780
1447,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"That warm’d his agued limbs, and, sad to see,"
1448,_SIR OWEN DALE._,That shook him fiercely as he gazed on me.
1449,_SIR OWEN DALE._,“I was confused in this unhappy view:
1450,_SIR OWEN DALE._,My wife! my friend! I could not think it true;
1451,_SIR OWEN DALE._,My children’s mother—my Alicia—laid
1452,_SIR OWEN DALE._,On such a bed! so wretched—so afraid!

1455,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And all the fear and terror in his look,"
1456,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Still more my mind to its foundation shook.      790
1457,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"At last he spoke:—‘Long since I would have died,      }"
1458,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But could not leave her, though for death I sigh’d,      }"

1464,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Ghastly he smiled;—I knew not what I felt,"
1465,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But my heart melted—hearts of flint would melt,"
1466,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"To see their anguish, penury, and shame,      800"
1467,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"How base, how low, how groveling they became."
1468,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"I could not speak my purpose, but my eyes"
1469,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And my expression bade the creature rise.
1470,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Yet, O! that woman’s look! my words are vain"
1471,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Her mix’d and troubled feelings to explain;
1472,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"True, there was shame and consciousness of fall,      }"
1473,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"But yet remembrance of my love withal,      }"
1474,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And knowledge of that power which she would now recal.      }
1475,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“But still the more that she to memory brought,"
1476,_SIR OWEN DALE._,The greater anguish in my mind was wrought;      810
1477,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The more she tried to bring the past in view,"
1478,_SIR OWEN DALE._,She greater horror on the present threw;
1479,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"So that, for love or pity, terror thrill’d"
1480,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"My blood, and vile and odious thoughts instill’d."
1481,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“This war within, these passions in their strife,"
1482,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"If thus protracted, had exhausted life;"
1483,_SIR OWEN DALE._,But the strong view of these departed years
1484,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Caused a full burst of salutary tears;
1485,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And, as I wept at large, and thought alone,"
1486,_SIR OWEN DALE._,I felt my reason re-ascend her throne.”      820

1490,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Strength, if not joy—their sufferings were their own.”—"
1491,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Alas, for them! their own in very deed!"
1492,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And they of mercy had the greater need;
1493,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Their own by purchase, for their frailty paid—"
1494,_SIR OWEN DALE._,And wanted heaven’s own justice human aid?
1495,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"And seeing this, could I beseech my God"
1496,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"For deeper misery, and a heavier rod?”      830"
1497,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“But could you help them?”—“Think, Sir Owen, how"
1498,_SIR OWEN DALE._,I saw them then—methinks I see them now!
1499,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"She had not food, nor aught a mother needs,"
1500,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Who for another life and dearer feeds.
1501,_SIR OWEN DALE._,I saw her speechless; on her wither’d breast
1502,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"The wither’d child extended, but not prest,"
1503,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"Who sought, with moving lip and feeble cry,"
1504,_SIR OWEN DALE._,Vain instinct! for the fount without supply.
1505,_SIR OWEN DALE._,"“Sure it was all a grievous, odious scene,      }"

1608,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,
1609,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Three weeks had past, and Richard rambles now"
1610,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Far as the dinners of the day allow;
1611,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He rode to Farley Grange and Finley Mere,"
1612,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That house so ancient, and that lake so clear:"
1613,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He rode to Ripley through that river gay,"
1614,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Where in the shallow stream the loaches play,"
1615,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And stony fragments stay the winding stream,"
1616,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And gilded pebbles at the bottom gleam,"
1617,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Giving their yellow surface to the sun,"
1618,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And making proud the waters as they run.      10
1619,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"It is a lovely place, and at the side"
1620,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Rises a mountain-rock in rugged pride;
1621,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And in that rock are shapes of shells, and forms"
1622,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of creatures in old worlds, of nameless worms,"
1623,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Whole generations lived and died ere man,"
1624,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A worm of other class, to crawl began."
1625,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"There is a town call’d Silford, where his steed"
1626,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Our traveller rested—He the while would feed
1627,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"His mind by walking to and fro, to meet,"
1628,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He knew not what adventure, in the street—      20"
1629,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,A stranger there; but yet a window-view
1630,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Gave him a face that he conceived he knew;
1631,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He saw a tall, fair, lovely lady, dress’d"
1632,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,As one whom taste and wealth had jointly bless’d;
1633,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He gazed, but soon a footman at the door"
1634,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Thundering, alarm’d her, who was seen no more."
1635,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“This was the lady whom her lover bound
1636,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In solemn contract, and then proved unsound:"
1637,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of this affair I have a clouded view,"
1638,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And should be glad to have it clear’d by you.”      30
1639,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So Richard spake, and instant George replied,"
1640,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"I had the story from the injured side,"
1641,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But when resentment and regret were gone,"
1642,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And pity (shaded by contempt) came on.
1643,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Frail was the hero of my tale, but still"
1644,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Was rather drawn by accident than will.
1645,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Some without meaning into guilt advance,"
1646,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"From want of guard, from vanity, from chance;"
1647,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Man’s weakness flies his more immediate pain,"
1648,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A little respite from his fears to gain,      40"
1649,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And takes the part that he would gladly fly,"
1650,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,If he had strength and courage to deny.
1651,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“But now my tale; and let the moral say,"
1652,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When hope can sleep, there’s danger in delay."
1653,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Not that for rashness, Richard, I would plead,"
1654,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For unadvised alliance—No, indeed."
1655,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Think ere the contract—but, contracted, stand"
1656,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"No more debating, take the ready hand."
1657,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When hearts are willing, and when fears subside,"
1658,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Trust not to time, but let the knot be tied;      50"
1659,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For when a lover has no more to do,      }"
1660,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He thinks in leisure, what shall I pursue?      }"
1661,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And then, who knows what objects come in view?      }"
1662,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For when, assured, the man has nought to keep"
1663,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"His wishes warm and active, then they sleep;"
1664,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Hopes die with fears; and then a man must lose
1665,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"All the gay visions, and delicious views,"
1666,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Once his mind’s wealth! He travels at his ease,"
1667,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Nor horrors now nor fairy-beauty sees.
1668,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When the kind goddess gives the wish’d assent,      60"
1669,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,No mortal business should the deed prevent;
1670,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But the blest youth should legal sanction seek
1671,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Ere yet the assenting blush has fled the cheek.
1672,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“And—hear me, Richard—man has reptile-pride"
1673,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That often rises when his fears subside;
1674,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When, like a trader feeling rich, he now"
1675,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Neglects his former smile, his humble bow,"
1676,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, conscious of his hoarded wealth, assumes"
1677,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"New airs, nor thinks how odious he becomes."
1678,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“There is a wandering, wavering train of thought      70"
1679,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That something seeks where nothing should be sought,"
1680,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And will a self-delighted spirit move
1681,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To dare the danger of pernicious love.”
1682,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,
1683,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,*       *       *       *       *
1684,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,
1685,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"First, be it granted all was duly said"
1686,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,By the fond youth to the believing maid;
1687,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Let us suppose with many a sigh there came
1688,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The declaration of the deathless flame;—
1689,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And so her answer—“She was happy then,"
1690,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Blest in herself, and did not think of men;"
1691,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, with such comforts in her present state,      80"
1692,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,A wish to change it was to tempt her fate;
1693,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That she would not; but yet she would confess      }
1694,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With him, she thought, her hazard would be less;      }"
1695,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Nay more, she would esteem, she would regard express;      }"
1696,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, to be brief—if he could wait and see"
1697,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,In a few years what his desires would be.”—
1698,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Henry for years read months, then weeks, nor found"
1699,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The lady thought his judgment was unsound;
1700,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“For months read weeks,” she read it to his praise,"
1701,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And had some thoughts of changing it to _days_.      90
1702,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And here a short excursion let me make,"
1703,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A lover tried, I think, for lovers’ sake;"
1704,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And teach the meaning in a lady’s mind,"
1705,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,When you can none in her expressions find.
1706,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Words are design’d that meaning to convey;      }
1707,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But often _Yea_ is hidden in a _Nay_!      }
1708,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, what the charmer wills, some gentle hints betray.      }"
1709,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then, too, when ladies mean to yield at length,"
1710,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"They match their reasons with the lover’s strength,"
1711,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, kindly cautious, will no force employ      100"
1712,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But such as he can baffle or destroy.
1713,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"As, when heroic lovers beauty woo’d,"
1714,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And were by magic’s mighty art withstood,"
1715,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The kind historian, for the dame afraid,"
1716,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Gave to the faithful knight the stronger aid.
1717,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A downright “_No!_” would make a man despair,"
1718,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Or leave for kinder nymph the cruel fair;
1719,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But “_No!_ because I’m very happy now;
1720,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Because I dread th’ irrevocable vow;
1721,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Because I fear papa will not approve;      110
1722,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Because I love not—No, I cannot love;"
1723,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Because you men of Cupid make a jest;
1724,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Because——in short, a single life is best.”"
1725,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A “_No!_” when back’d by reasons of such force,"
1726,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Invites approach, and will recede of course."
1727,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Ladies, like towns besieged, for honour’s sake,"
1728,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Will some defence or its appearance make;
1729,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On first approach there’s much resistance made,"
1730,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And conscious weakness hides in bold parade;
1731,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With lofty looks, and threat’nings stern and proud,      120"
1732,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Come, if you dare,” is said in language loud."
1733,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, if th’ attack be made with care and skill,"
1734,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Come,” says the yielding party, “if you will;”"
1735,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then each the other’s valiant acts approve,"
1736,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And twine their laurels in a wreath of love.—
1737,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"We now retrace our tale, and forward go,—"
1738,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Thus Henry rightly read Cecilia’s “No!”
1739,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"His prudent father, who had duly weigh’d,"
1740,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And well approved the fortune of the maid,"
1741,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Not much resisted—just enough to show      130
1742,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He knew his power, and would his son should know."
1743,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Harry, I will, while I your bargain make,"
1744,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That you a journey to our patron take.
1745,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,I know her guardian; care will not become
1746,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A lad when courting; as you must be dumb,"
1747,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"You may be absent; I for you will speak,"
1748,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And ask what you are not supposed to seek.”
1749,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Then came the parting hour—and what arise
1750,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When lovers part! expressive looks and eyes,"
1751,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Tender and tear-full—many a fond adieu,      140"
1752,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And many a call the sorrow to renew;
1753,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Sighs such as lovers only can explain,"
1754,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And words that they might undertake in vain.
1755,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia liked it not; she had, in truth,"
1756,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,No mind to part with her enamour’d youth;
1757,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But thought it foolish thus themselves to cheat,"
1758,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And part for nothing but again to meet.
1759,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Now Henry’s father was a man whose heart
1760,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Took with his interest a decided part;
1761,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He [knew] his lordship, and was known for acts      150"
1762,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That I omit—they were acknowledged facts;
1763,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"An interest somewhere—I the place forget,"
1764,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And the good deed—no matter—’twas a debt.
1765,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Thither must Henry, and in vain the maid"
1766,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Express’d dissent—the father was obey’d.
1767,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, though the maid was by her fears assail’d,"
1768,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Her reason rose against them, and prevail’d;"
1769,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Fear saw him hunting, leaping, falling—led,      }"
1770,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Maim’d and disfigured, groaning to his bed;      }"
1771,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Saw him in perils, duels—dying—dead.      160}"
1772,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But Prudence answer’d, “Is not every maid"
1773,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,With equal cause for him she loves afraid?”
1774,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And from her guarded mind Cecilia threw
1775,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The groundless terrors that will love pursue.
1776,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She had no doubts, and her reliance strong"
1777,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Upon the honour that she would not wrong.
1778,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Firm in herself, she doubted not the truth"
1779,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of him, the chosen, the selected youth;"
1780,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Trust of herself a trust in him supplied;      }
1781,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And she believed him faithful, though untried;      170}"
1782,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On her he might depend, in him she would confide.      }"
1783,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,If some fond girl express’d a tender pain
1784,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Lest some fair rival should allure her swain:
1785,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To such she answer’d, with a look severe,"
1786,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“Can one you doubt be worthy of your fear?”
1787,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"My lord was kind—a month had pass’d away,      }"
1788,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And Henry stay’d—he sometimes named a day;      }
1789,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But still my lord was kind, and Henry still must stay.      }"
1790,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,His father’s words to him were words of fate—
1791,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Wait, ’tis your duty; ’tis my pleasure, wait!”      180"
1792,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In all his walks, in hilly heath or wood,"
1793,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Cecilia’s form the pensive youth pursued;
1794,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In the gray morning, in the silent noon,      }"
1795,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In the soft twilight, by the sober moon,      }"
1796,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In those forsaken rooms, in that immense saloon;      }"
1797,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And he, now fond of that seclusion grown,"
1798,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"There reads her letters, and there writes his own."
1799,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Here none approach,” said he, “to interfere,"
1800,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But I can think of my Cecilia here!”
1801,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But there did come—and how it came to pass      190
1802,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Who shall explain?—a mild and blue-eyed lass.—
1803,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"It was the work of accident, no doubt—      }"
1804,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The cause unknown—we say, “as things fall out”—      }"
1805,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The damsel enter’d there, in wand’ring round about.      }"
1806,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"At first she saw not Henry; and she ran,"
1807,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"As from a ghost, when she beheld a man."
1808,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She was esteem’d a beauty through the hall,"
1809,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And so admitted, with consent of all;"
1810,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, like a treasure, was her beauty kept"
1811,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,From every guest who in the mansion slept;      200
1812,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Whether as friends who join’d the noble pair,"
1813,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Or those invited by the steward there.
1814,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She was the daughter of a priest, whose life"
1815,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Was brief and sad: he lost a darling wife,"
1816,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And Fanny then her father, who could save"
1817,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But a small portion; but his all he gave,"
1818,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With the fair orphan, to a sister’s care,"
1819,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And her good spouse; they were the ruling pair—
1820,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Steward and steward’s lady—o’er a tribe,"
1821,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Each under each, whom I shall not describe.      210"
1822,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"This grave old couple, childless and alone,"
1823,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Would, by their care, for Fanny’s loss atone:"
1824,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,She had been taught in schools of honest fame;
1825,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And to the hall, as to a home, she came,"
1826,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"My lord assenting; yet, as meet and right,"
1827,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Fanny was held from every hero’s sight,"
1828,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Who might in youthful error cast his eyes
1829,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On one so gentle as a lawful prize,"
1830,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On border land, whom, as their right or prey,"
1831,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,A youth from either side might bear away.      220
1832,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Some handsome lover of th’ inferior class
1833,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Might as a wife approve the lovely lass;
1834,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Or some invader from the class above,      }"
1835,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Who, more presuming, would his passion prove      }"
1836,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,By asking less—love only for his love.      }
1837,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"This much experienced aunt her fear express’d,"
1838,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And dread of old and young, of host and guest."
1839,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Go not, my Fanny, in their way,” she cried;      }"
1840,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“It is not right that virtue should be tried;      }
1841,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So, to be safe, be ever at my side.”      230}"
1842,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,She was not ever at that side; but still
1843,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Observed her precepts, and obey’d her will."
1844,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But in the morning’s dawn and evening’s gloom
1845,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,She could not lock the damsel in her room;
1846,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And Fanny thought, “I will ascend these stairs"
1847,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To see the chapel—there are none at prayers”;
1848,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"None, she believed, had yet to dress return’d,"
1849,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"By whom a timid girl might be discern’d,"
1850,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In her slow motion, looking, as she glides,"
1851,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On pictures, busts, and what she met besides,      240"
1852,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And speaking softly to herself alone,"
1853,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Or singing low in melancholy tone;
1854,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And thus she rambled through the still domain,"
1855,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Room after room, again, and yet again."
1856,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, to retrace our story, still we say,"
1857,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To this saloon the maiden took her way;
1858,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Where she beheld our youth, and frighten’d ran,"
1859,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And so their friendship in her fear began.
1860,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But dare she thither once again advance,"
1861,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And still suppose the man will think it chance?      250
1862,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Nay, yet again; and what has chance to do"
1863,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,With this?—I know not; doubtless Fanny knew.
1864,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Now, of the meeting of a modest maid"
1865,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And sober youth why need we be afraid?
1866,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And when a girl’s amusements are so few
1867,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"As Fanny’s were, what would you have her do?"
1868,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Reserved herself, a decent youth to find,"
1869,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And just be civil, sociable, and kind,"
1870,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And look together at the setting sun,"
1871,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Then at each other—What the evil done?      260
1872,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then Fanny took my little lord to play,"
1873,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And bade him not intrude on Henry’s way.
1874,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“O, he intrudes not!” said the youth, and grew"
1875,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Fond of the child, and would amuse him too;"
1876,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Would make such faces, and assume such looks—"
1877,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,He loved it better than his gayest books.
1878,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When man with man would an acquaintance seek,"
1879,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,He will his thoughts in chosen language speak;
1880,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And they converse on divers themes, to find"
1881,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,If they possess a corresponding mind;      270
1882,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But man with woman has foundation laid,"
1883,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And built up friendship ere a word is said.
1884,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"’Tis not with words that they their wishes tell,"
1885,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But with a language answering quite as well;
1886,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And thus they find, when they begin t’explore"
1887,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Their way by speech, they knew it all before."
1888,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And now it chanced again the pair, when dark,"
1889,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Met in their way, when wandering in the park;"
1890,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Not in the common path, for so they might,"
1891,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Without a wonder, wander day or night;      280"
1892,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, when in pathless ways their chance will bring"
1893,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A musing pair, we do admire the thing."
1894,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The youth in meeting read the damsel’s face,"
1895,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,As if he meant her inmost thoughts to trace;
1896,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On which her colour changed, as if she meant"
1897,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To give her aid, and help his kind intent."
1898,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Both smiled and parted, but they did not speak—"
1899,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The smile implied, “Do tell me what you seek.”"
1900,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"They took their different ways with erring feet,"
1901,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And met again, surprised that they could meet;      290"
1902,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Then must they speak—and something of the air
1903,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Is always ready—“’Tis extremely fair!”
1904,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“It was so pleasant!” Henry said; “the beam
1905,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Of that sweet light so brilliant on the stream;
1906,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And chiefly yonder, where that old cascade"
1907,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Has for an age its simple music made;
1908,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"All so delightful, soothing, and serene!"
1909,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Do you not feel it? not enjoy the scene?
1910,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Something it has that words will not express,      }"
1911,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But rather hide, and make th’ enjoyment less:      300}"
1912,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"’Tis what our souls conceive, ’tis what our hearts confess.”      }"
1913,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Poor Fanny’s heart at these same words confess’d
1914,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"How well he painted, and how rightly guess’d;"
1915,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, while they stood admiring their retreat,"
1916,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Henry found something like a mossy seat;
1917,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But Fanny sat not; no, she rather pray’d"
1918,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That she might leave him, she was so afraid—"
1919,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Not, sir, of you; your goodness I can trust;"
1920,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But folks are so censorious and unjust,"
1921,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"They make no difference, they pay no regard      310"
1922,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To our true meaning, which is very hard"
1923,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And very cruel; great the pain it cost
1924,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To lose such pleasure, but it must be lost."
1925,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Did people know how free from thought of ill
1926,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"One’s meaning is, their malice would be still.”"
1927,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,At this she wept; at least a glittering gem
1928,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Shone in each eye, and there was fire in them,"
1929,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For, as they fell, the sparkles, at his feet,"
1930,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,He felt emotions very warm and sweet.
1931,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“A lovely creature! not more fair than good;      320
1932,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"By all admired, by some, it seems, pursued;"
1933,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Yet self-protected by her virtue’s force
1934,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And conscious truth—What evil in discourse
1935,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With one so guarded, who is pleased to trust"
1936,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Herself with me, reliance strong and just?”"
1937,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Our lover then believed he must not seem
1938,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Cold to the maid who gave him her esteem;
1939,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Not manly this; Cecilia had his heart,"
1940,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But it was lawful with his time to part.
1941,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,It would be wrong in her to take amiss      330
1942,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,A virtuous friendship for a girl like this;
1943,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"False or disloyal he would never prove,"
1944,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But kindness here took nothing from his love.
1945,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Soldiers to serve a foreign prince are known,"
1946,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,When not on present duty to their own;
1947,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So, though our bosom’s queen we still prefer,"
1948,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,We are not always on our knees to her.
1949,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Cecilia present, witness yon fair moon,"
1950,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And yon bright orbs, that fate would change as soon"
1951,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,As my devotion; but the absent sun      340
1952,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Cheers us no longer when his course is run;
1953,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And then those starry twinklers may obtain
1954,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,A little worship till he shines again.”
1955,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The father still commanded “Wait awhile;”
1956,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And the son answer’d in submissive style,"
1957,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Grieved, but obedient; and obedience teased"
1958,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,His lady’s spirit more than grieving pleased.
1959,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That he should grieve in absence was most fit,"
1960,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But not that he to absence should submit;
1961,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And in her letters might be traced reproof,      350"
1962,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Distant indeed, but visible enough;"
1963,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,This should the wandering of his heart have stay’d;
1964,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Alas! the wanderer was the vainer made.
1965,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The parties daily met, as by consent,"
1966,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And yet it always seem’d by accident;
1967,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Till in the nymph the shepherd had been blind
1968,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"If he had fail’d to see a manner kind,"
1969,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With that expressive look, that seem’d to say,"
1970,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“You do not speak, and yet you see you may.”"
1971,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"O! yes, he saw, and he resolved to fly,      360"
1972,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And blamed his heart, unwilling to comply:"
1973,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He sometimes wonder’d how it came to pass,"
1974,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That he had all this freedom with the lass;
1975,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Reserved herself, with strict attention kept,"
1976,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And care and vigilance that never slept:
1977,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“How is it thus that they a beauty trust
1978,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With me, who feel the confidence is just?"
1979,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And they, too, feel it; yes, they may confide;”—"
1980,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He said in folly, and he smiled in pride."
1981,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"’Tis thus our secret passions work their way,      370"
1982,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And the poor victims know not they obey.
1983,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Familiar now became the wandering pair,"
1984,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And there was pride and joy in Fanny’s air;
1985,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For, though his silence did not please the maid,"
1986,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,She judged him only modest and afraid.
1987,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The gentle dames are ever pleased to find
1988,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Their lovers dreading they should prove unkind;
1989,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So, blind by hope, and pleased with prospects gay,      }"
1990,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The generous beauty gave her heart away      }
1991,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Before he said, “I love!”—alas! he dared not say.      380}"
1992,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia yet was mistress of his mind,"
1993,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But oft he wish’d her, like his Fanny, kind;"
1994,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Her fondness sooth’d him, for the man was vain,"
1995,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And he perceived that he could give her pain;
1996,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia liked not to profess her love,"
1997,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But Fanny ever was the yielding dove;
1998,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Tender and trusting, waiting for the word,"
1999,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And then prepared to hail her bosom’s lord.
2000,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia once her honest love avow’d,"
2001,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To make him happy, not to make him proud;      390"
2002,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But she would not, for every asking sigh,"
2003,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Confess the flame that waked his vanity;
2004,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But this poor maiden, every day and hour,"
2005,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Would, by fresh kindness, feed the growing power;"
2006,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And he indulged, vain being! in the joy,"
2007,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That he alone could raise it, or destroy;"
2008,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A present good, from which he dared not fly,"
2009,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia absent, and his Fanny by."
2010,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"O! vain desire of youth, that in the hour"
2011,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of strong temptation, when he feels the power,      400"
2012,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And knows how daily his desires increase,"
2013,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Yet will he wait, and sacrifice his peace;"
2014,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Will trust to chance to free him from the snare,"
2015,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of which, long since, his conscience said, beware!"
2016,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Or look for strange deliverance from that ill,"
2017,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That he might fly, could he command the will!"
2018,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"How can he freedom from the future seek,"
2019,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Who feels already that he grows too weak?
2020,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And thus refuses to resist, till time"
2021,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Removes the power, and makes the way for crime.      410"
2022,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Yet thoughts he had, and he would think, “Forego"
2023,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,My dear Cecilia? not for kingdoms! No!
2024,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But may I, ought I, not the friend to be"
2025,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Of one who feels this fond regard for me?
2026,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,I wrong no creature by a kindness lent
2027,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To one so gentle, mild, and innocent;"
2028,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And for that fair one, whom I still adore,"
2029,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,By feeling thus I think of her the more”—
2030,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And not unlikely, for our thoughts will tend"
2031,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To those whom we are conscious we offend.      420
2032,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Had Reason whisper’d, “Has Cecilia leave"
2033,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Some gentle youth in friendship to receive,"
2034,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And be to him the friend that you appear      }
2035,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To this soft girl?”—would not some jealous fear      }
2036,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Proclaim your thoughts, that he approach’d too near?      }"
2037,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But Henry, blinded still, presumed to write"
2038,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Of one in whom Cecilia would delight:
2039,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A mild and modest girl, a gentle friend,"
2040,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"If, as he hoped, her kindness would descend—"
2041,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But what he fear’d to lose or hoped to gain      430
2042,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"By writing thus, he had been ask’d in vain."
2043,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"It was his purpose, every morn he rose,"
2044,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The dangerous friendship he had made to close;
2045,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"It was his torment nightly, ere he slept,"
2046,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To feel his prudent purpose was not kept.
2047,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"True, he has wonder’d why the timid maid"
2048,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Meets him so often, and is not afraid;"
2049,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And why that female dragon, fierce and keen,      }"
2050,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Has never in their private walks been seen;      }
2051,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And often he has thought, “What can their silence mean?      440}"
2052,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“They can have no design, or plot, or plan,—"
2053,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In fact, I know not how the thing began,—"
2054,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"’Tis their dependence on my credit here,"
2055,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And fear not, nor, in fact, have cause to fear.”"
2056,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But did that pair, who seem’d to think that all"
2057,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Unwatch’d will wander and unguarded fall,"
2058,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Did they permit a youth and maid to meet
2059,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Both unreproved? were they so indiscreet?
2060,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"This sometimes enter’d Henry’s mind, and then,"
2061,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“Who shall account for women or for men?”      450
2062,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,He said; “or who their secret thoughts explore?
2063,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Why do I vex me? I will think no more.”
2064,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"My lord of late had said, in manner kind,"
2065,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“My good friend Harry, do not think us blind!”"
2066,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Letters had past, though he had nothing seen,"
2067,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,His careful father and my lord between;
2068,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But to what purpose was to him unknown—
2069,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"It might be borough business, or their own."
2070,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Fanny, it seem’d, was now no more in dread;"
2071,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"If one approach’d, she neither fear’d nor fled.      460"
2072,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,He mused on this—“But wherefore her alarm?
2073,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She knows me better, and she dreads no harm.”"
2074,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Something his father wrote that gave him pain:
2075,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“I know not, son, if you should yet remain;—"
2076,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Be cautious, Harry; favours to procure"
2077,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"We strain a point, but we must first be sure."
2078,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Love is a folly—that, indeed, is true—      }"
2079,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But something still is to our honour due;      }
2080,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,So I must leave the thing to my good lord and you.”      }
2081,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But from Cecilia came remonstrance strong:      470
2082,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“You write too darkly, and you stay too long;"
2083,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"We hear reports; and, Henry—mark me well—"
2084,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,I heed not every tale that triflers tell;—
2085,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Be you no trifler; dare not to believe
2086,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That I am one whom words and vows deceive:
2087,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"You know your heart, your hazard you will learn,"
2088,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And this your trial——instantly return.”—
2089,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Unjust, injurious, jealous, cruel maid!      }"
2090,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Am I a slave, of haughty words afraid?      }"
2091,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Can she who thus commands expect to be obey’d?      480}
2092,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"O! how unlike this dear assenting soul,"
2093,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Whose heart a man might at his will control!”
2094,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Uneasy, anxious, fill’d with self-reproof,"
2095,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,He now resolved to quit his patron’s roof;
2096,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And then again his vacillating mind
2097,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To stay resolved, and that her pride should find."
2098,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Debating thus, his pen the lover took,"
2099,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And chose the words of anger and rebuke.
2100,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Again, yet once again, the conscious pair"
2101,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Met, and “O, speak!” was Fanny’s silent prayer;      490"
2102,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And, “I must speak,” said the embarrass’d youth,"
2103,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Must save my honour, must confess the truth."
2104,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then, I must lose her; but, by slow degrees,"
2105,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She will regain her peace, and I my ease.”"
2106,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Ah! foolish man! to virtue true nor vice,"
2107,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He buys distress, and self-esteem the price;"
2108,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And what his gain?—a tender smile and sigh
2109,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,From a fond girl to feed his vanity.
2110,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Thus, every day they lived, and every time"
2111,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"They met, increased his anguish and his crime.      500"
2112,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Still in their meetings they were ofttimes nigh
2113,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The darling theme, and then past trembling by;"
2114,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,On those occasions Henry often tried
2115,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,For the sad truth—and then his heart denied
2116,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The utterance due: thus daily he became
2117,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The prey of weakness, vanity, and shame."
2118,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But soon a day, that was their doubts to close,"
2119,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,On the fond maid and thoughtless youth arose.
2120,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Within the park, beside the bounding brook,"
2121,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The social pair their usual ramble took;      510
2122,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And there the steward found them; they could trace
2123,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"News in his look, and gladness in his face."
2124,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He was a man of riches, bluff and big,"
2125,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With clean brown broad-cloth, and with white cut wig:"
2126,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He bore a cane of price, with riband tied,"
2127,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And a fat spaniel waddled at his side.
2128,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To every being whom he met he gave
2129,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"His looks expressive: civil, gay, or grave,"
2130,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But condescending all; and each declared
2131,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"How much he govern’d, and how well he fared.      520"
2132,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"This great man bow’d, not humbly, but his bow"
2133,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Appear’d familiar converse to allow.
2134,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The trembling Fanny, as he came in view,"
2135,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Within the chestnut grove in fear withdrew;
2136,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"While Henry wonder’d, not without a fear,"
2137,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Of that which brought th’ important man so near.
2138,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Doubt was dispersed by—“My esteem’d young man!”
2139,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,As he with condescending grace began——
2140,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“Though you with youthful frankness nobly trust
2141,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Your Fanny’s friends, and doubtless think them just;      530"
2142,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Though you have not, with craving soul, applied"
2143,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To us, and ask’d the fortune of your bride:"
2144,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Be it our care that you shall not lament
2145,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That love has made you so improvident.
2146,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“An orphan maid——Your patience! you shall have
2147,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Your time to speak, I now attention crave—"
2148,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Fanny, dear girl! has in my spouse and me"
2149,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Friends of a kind we wish our friends to be,"
2150,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"None of the poorest——nay, sir, no reply;"
2151,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,You shall not need——and we are born to die;      540
2152,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And one yet crawls on earth, of whom I say"
2153,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That what he has he cannot take away—
2154,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Her mother’s father, one who has a store"
2155,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of this world’s good, and always looks for more;"
2156,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, next his money, loves the girl at heart,"
2157,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And she will have it when they come to part.”
2158,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Sir,” said the youth, his terrors all awake,"
2159,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Hear me, I pray, I beg—for mercy’s sake!"
2160,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Sir, were the secrets of my soul confess’d,"
2161,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Would you admit the truths that I protest      550
2162,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Are such——your pardon”——
2163,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Pardon! good, my friend,"
2164,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"I not alone will pardon, I commend:"
2165,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Think you that I have no remembrance left
2166,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of youthful love, and Cupid’s cunning theft?"
2167,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"How nymphs will listen when their swains persuade,"
2168,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"How hearts are gain’d, and how exchange is made?—"
2169,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Come, sir, your hand”——"
2170,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“In mercy, hear me now!”"
2171,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“I cannot hear you, time will not allow."
2172,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"You know my station, what on me depends,"
2173,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,For ever needed—but we part as friends;      560
2174,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And here comes one who will the whole explain,"
2175,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,My better self—and we shall meet again.”
2176,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Sir, I entreat”——"
2177,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“Then be entreaty made
2178,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To her, a woman, one you may persuade;"
2179,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A little teasing, but she will comply,      }"
2180,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And loves her niece too fondly to deny.”      }
2181,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“O! he is mad, and miserable I!”      }"
2182,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Exclaim’d the youth; “But let me now collect
2183,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,My scatter’d thoughts; I something must effect.”
2184,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Hurrying she came—“Now, what has he confess’d,      570"
2185,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Ere I could come to set your heart at rest?
2186,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"What! he has grieved you! Yet he, too, approves"
2187,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The thing! but man will tease you, if he loves."
2188,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“But now for business: tell me, did you think"
2189,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,That we should always at your meetings wink?
2190,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Think you, you walk’d unseen? There are who bring"
2191,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To me all secrets—O, you wicked thing!"
2192,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Poor Fanny! now I think I see her blush
2193,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"All red and rosy, when I beat the bush;"
2194,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And ‘hide your secret,’ said I, ‘if you dare!’      580"
2195,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So out it came, like an affrighten’d hare."
2196,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“‘Miss!’ said I, gravely; and the trembling maid"
2197,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Pleased me at heart to see her so afraid;
2198,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And then she wept;—now, do remember this,"
2199,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Never to chide her when she does amiss;
2200,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For she is tender as the callow bird,"
2201,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And cannot bear to have her temper stirr’d;—
2202,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"‘Fanny,’ I said, then whisper’d her the name,"
2203,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And caused such looks—Yes, yours are just the same;"
2204,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But hear my story—When your love was known      590
2205,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"For this our child—she is, in fact, our own—"
2206,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then, first debating, we agreed at last"
2207,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To seek my lord, and tell him what had past.”"
2208,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“To tell the earl?”
2209,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Yes, truly, and why not?"
2210,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And then together we contrived our plot.”
2211,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“Eternal God!”
2212,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Nay, be not so surprised,—"
2213,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,In all the matter we were well advised;
2214,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"We saw my lord, and Lady Jane was there,"
2215,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And said to Johnson, ‘Johnson, take a chair.’"
2216,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"True, we are servants in a certain way,      600}"
2217,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But in the higher places so are they;      }
2218,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"We are obey’d in ours, and they in theirs obey.—      }"
2219,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So Johnson bow’d, for that was right and fit,"
2220,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And had no scruple with the earl to sit—
2221,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Why look you so impatient while I tell
2222,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,What they debated?—you must like it well.
2223,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“‘Let them go on,’ our gracious earl began;"
2224,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"‘They will go off,’ said, joking, my good man:"
2225,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,‘Well!’ said the countess—she’s a lover’s friend—
2226,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,‘What if they do? they make the speedier end.’——      610
2227,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But be you more composed, for that dear child"
2228,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Is with her joy and apprehension wild:
2229,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"O! we have watch’d you on from day to day,"
2230,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,‘There go the lovers!’ we were wont to say—
2231,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But why that look?”—
2232,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Dear madam, I implore"
2233,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,A single moment!”
2234,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“I can give no more:
2235,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Here are your letters—‘that’s a female pen,’"
2236,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Said I to Fanny—‘’tis his sister’s, then,’"
2237,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Replied the maid.—No! never must you stray;
2238,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Or hide your wanderings, if you should, I pray;      620"
2239,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"I know, at least I fear, the best may err,"
2240,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But keep the by-walks of your life from her:
2241,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That youth should stray is nothing to be told,"
2242,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When they have sanction in the grave and old,"
2243,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Who have no call to wander and transgress,"
2244,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But very love of change and wantonness.
2245,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“I prattle idly, while your letters wait,"
2246,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And then my lord has much that he would state,"
2247,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"All good to you—do clear that clouded face,"
2248,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And with good looks your lucky lot embrace.      630
2249,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Now, mind that none with her divide your heart,"
2250,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,For she would die ere lose the smallest part;
2251,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And I rejoice that all has gone so well,"
2252,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,For who th’ effect of Johnson’s rage can tell?
2253,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He had his fears when you began to meet,"
2254,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,But I assured him there was no deceit.
2255,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He is a man who kindness will requite,"
2256,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, injured once, revenge is his delight;"
2257,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And he would spend the best of his estates
2258,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To ruin, goods and body, them he hates;      640"
2259,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,While he is kind enough when he approves
2260,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"A deed that’s done, and serves the man he loves."
2261,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Come, read your letters—I must now be gone,"
2262,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And think of matters that are coming on.”
2263,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Henry was lost—his brain confused, his soul"
2264,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Dismay’d and sunk, his thoughts beyond control;"
2265,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Borne on by terror, he foreboding read"
2266,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Cecilia’s letter! and his courage fled;
2267,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"All was a gloomy, dark, and dreadful view,"
2268,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He felt him guilty, but indignant too:—      650"
2269,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And as he read, he felt the high disdain"
2270,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Of injured men—“She may repent, in vain.”"
2271,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia much had heard, and told him all"
2272,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That scandal taught—“A servant at the hall,"
2273,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Or servant’s daughter, in the kitchen bred,"
2274,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Whose father would not with her mother wed,"
2275,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Was now his choice! a blushing fool, the toy,"
2276,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Or the attempted, both of man and boy;"
2277,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"More than suspected, but without the wit"
2278,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Or the allurements for such creatures fit;      660
2279,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Not virtuous, though unfeeling; cold as ice,"
2280,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And yet not chaste; the weeping fool of vice;
2281,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Yielding, not tender; feeble, not refined;"
2282,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Her form insipid, and without a mind."
2283,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Rival! she spurn’d the word; but let him stay,"
2284,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Warn’d as he was, beyond the present day:"
2285,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Whate’er his patron might object to this,"
2286,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The uncle-butler, or the weeping miss—"
2287,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Let him from this one single day remain,"
2288,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And then return he would to her in vain!      670
2289,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"There let him then abide, to earn, or crave"
2290,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Food undeserved, and be with slaves a slave!”"
2291,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Had reason guided anger, govern’d zeal,"
2292,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Or chosen words to make a lover feel,"
2293,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,She might have saved him—anger and abuse
2294,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Will but defiance and revenge produce.
2295,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Unjust and cruel, insolent and proud!”"
2296,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He said, indignant; and he spoke aloud."
2297,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“‘Butler’! and ‘servant’! Gentlest of thy sex,"
2298,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Thou wouldst not thus a man who loved thee vex;      680
2299,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Thou wouldst not thus to vile report give ear,      }"
2300,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Nor thus enraged for fancied crimes appear—      }
2301,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"I know not what, dear maid!—if thy soft smiles were here.”      }"
2302,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And then, that instant, there appear’d the maid,"
2303,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,By his sad looks in her approach dismay’d;
2304,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Such timid sweetness, and so wrong’d, did more"
2305,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Than all her pleading tenderness before.
2306,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In that weak moment, when disdain and pride,"
2307,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And fear and fondness, drew the man aside,"
2308,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In this weak moment—“Wilt thou,” he began,      690"
2309,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“Be mine?” and joy o’er all her features ran;
2310,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“I will!” she softly whisper’d; but the roar
2311,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Of cannon would not strike his spirit more;
2312,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Ev’n as his lips the lawless contract seal’d
2313,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He felt that conscience lost her seven-fold shield,"
2314,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And honour fled; but still he spoke of love,"
2315,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And all was joy in the consenting dove.
2316,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That evening all in fond discourse was spent,      }"
2317,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When the sad lover to his chamber went,      }"
2318,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To think on what had past, to grieve and to repent.      700}"
2319,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Early he rose, and look’d with many a sigh"
2320,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,On the red light that fill’d the eastern sky;
2321,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Oft had he stood before, alert and gay,"
2322,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,To hail the glories of the new-born day;
2323,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But now dejected, languid, listless, low,"
2324,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He saw the wind upon the water blow,"
2325,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And the cold stream curl’d onward as the gale
2326,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,From the pine-hill blew harshly down the dale.
2327,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On the right side the youth a wood survey’d,"
2328,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,With all its dark intensity of shade;      710
2329,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Where the rough wind alone was heard to move,"
2330,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In this, the pause of nature and of love,"
2331,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When now the young are rear’d, and when the old,"
2332,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Lost to the tie, grow negligent and cold—"
2333,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Far to the left he saw the huts of men,"
2334,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Half hid in mist, that hung upon the fen;"
2335,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Before him swallows, gathering for the sea,"
2336,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Took their short flights, and twitter’d on the lea;"
2337,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And near the bean-sheaf stood, the harvest done,"
2338,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And slowly blacken’d in the sickly sun;      720
2339,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"All these were sad in nature, or they took"
2340,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Sadness from him, the likeness of his look,"
2341,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And of his mind—he ponder’d for a while,"
2342,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Then met his Fanny with a borrow’d smile.
2343,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Not much remain’d; for money and my lord
2344,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Soon made the father of the youth accord;
2345,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"His prudence half resisted, half obey’d,"
2346,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And scorn kept still the guardians of the maid.
2347,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Cecilia never on the subject spoke,"
2348,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,She seem’d as one who from a dream awoke;      730
2349,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"So all was peace, and soon the married pair"
2350,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Fix’d with fair fortune in a mansion fair.
2351,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Five years had past, and what was Henry then?"
2352,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The most repining of repenting men;
2353,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"With a fond, teasing, anxious wife, afraid"
2354,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Of all attention to another paid;
2355,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Yet, powerless she her husband to amuse"
2356,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Lives but t’ entreat, implore, resent, accuse;"
2357,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Jealous and tender, conscious of defects,"
2358,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She merits little, and yet much expects;      740"
2359,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She looks for love that now she cannot see,"
2360,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And sighs for joy that never more can be;
2361,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"On his retirements her complaints intrude,"
2362,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And fond reproof endears his solitude;
2363,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"While he her weakness (once her kindness) sees,"
2364,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And his affections in her languor freeze;
2365,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Regret, uncheck’d by hope, devours his mind,"
2366,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He feels unhappy, and he grows unkind."
2367,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"“Fool! to be taken by a rosy cheek,"
2368,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And eyes that cease to sparkle or to speak;      750
2369,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Fool! for this child my freedom to resign,"
2370,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When one, the glory of her sex, was mine;"
2371,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"While from this burthen to my soul I hide,"
2372,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"To think what Fate has dealt, and what denied."
2373,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,“What fiend possess’d me when I tamely gave
2374,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,My forced assent to be an idiot’s slave?
2375,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Her beauty vanish’d, what for me remains?"
2376,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Th’ eternal clicking of the galling chains.
2377,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Her person truly I may think my own,"
2378,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Seen without pleasure, without triumph shown:      760"
2379,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Doleful she sits, her children at her knees,"
2380,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And gives up all her feeble powers to please;
2381,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Whom I, unmoved, or moved with scorn, behold,"
2382,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Melting as ice, as vapid and as cold.”"
2383,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Such was his fate, and he must yet endure"
2384,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,The self-contempt that no self-love can cure.
2385,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Some business call’d him to a wealthy town
2386,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,When unprepared for more than Fortune’s frown;
2387,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"There at a house he gave his luckless name,"
2388,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"The master absent, and Cecilia came.      770"
2389,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Unhappy man! he could not, dared not speak,"
2390,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But look’d around, as if retreat to seek;"
2391,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"This she allow’d not; but, with brow severe,"
2392,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Ask’d him his business, sternly bent to hear."
2393,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"He had no courage, but he view’d that face      }"
2394,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,As if he sought for sympathy and grace;      }
2395,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,As if some kind returning thought to trace—      }
2396,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"In vain; not long he waited, but, with air"
2397,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That of all grace compell’d him to despair,"
2398,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"She rang the bell, and, when a servant came,      780"
2399,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Left the repentant traitor to his shame;
2400,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"But, going, spoke, “Attend this person out,"
2401,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And if he speaks, hear what he comes about!”"
2402,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then, with cool curtesy, from the room withdrew,"
2403,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"That seem’d to say, “Unhappy man, adieu!”"
2404,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,Thus will it be when man permits a vice
2405,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"First to invade his heart, and then entice;"
2406,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When wishes vain and undefined arise,"
2407,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"And that weak heart deceive, seduce, surprise;"
2408,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"When evil Fortune works on Folly’s side,      790"
2409,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,And rash Resentment adds a spur to Pride;
2410,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,"Then life’s long troubles from these actions come,"
2411,_DELAY HAS DANGER._,In which a moment may decide our doom.

2451,_THE NATURAL DEATH OF LOVE._,The very heathen taught the virtues too.

2540,_THE NATURAL DEATH OF LOVE._,"The passion failing, fading to complaint;"
2541,_THE NATURAL DEATH OF LOVE._,The gathering grief for joys remember’d yet;
2542,_THE NATURAL DEATH OF LOVE._,"The vain remonstrance, and the weak regret."
2543,_THE NATURAL DEATH OF LOVE._,First speaks the wife in sorrow; she is grieved
2544,_THE NATURAL DEATH OF LOVE._,"T’ admit the truth, and would be still deceived.”"

2548,_HENRY AND EMMA._,
2549,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ Well, my good sir, I shall contend no more;"
2550,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But, O! the vows you made, the oaths you swore—      110"
2551,_HENRY AND EMMA._,_H._ To love you always—I confess it true;
2552,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And do I not? If not, what can I do?"
2553,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Moreover think what you yourself profess’d,"
2554,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And then the subject may for ever rest.
2555,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ Yes, sir, obedience I profess’d; I know"
2556,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"My debt, and wish to pay you all I owe—"
2557,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Pay without murmur; but that vow was made
2558,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To you, who said it never should be paid.—"
2559,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Now truly tell me why you took such care
2560,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To make me err? I ask’d you not to swear,      120"
2561,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But rather hoped you would my mind direct,"
2562,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And say, when married, what you would expect."
2563,_HENRY AND EMMA._,You may remember—it is not so long
2564,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Since you affirm’d that I could not be wrong;
2565,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"I told you then—you recollect, I told"
2566,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The very truth—that humour would not hold;
2567,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Not that I thought, or ever could suppose,      }"
2568,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The mighty raptures were so soon to close—      }
2569,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Poetic flights of love all sunk in sullen prose.      }
2570,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Do you remember how you used to hang      130
2571,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Upon my looks? your transports when I sang?
2572,_HENRY AND EMMA._,I play’d—you melted into tears; I moved—      }
2573,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Voice, words, and motion, how you all approved;      }"
2574,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"A time when Emma reign’d, a time when Henry loved.      }"
2575,_HENRY AND EMMA._,You recollect?
2576,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._            Yes, surely; and then why"
2577,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The needless truths? do I the facts deny?
2578,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"For this remonstrance I can see no need,"
2579,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Or this impatience—if you do, proceed."
2580,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ O! that is now so cool, and with a smile"
2581,_HENRY AND EMMA._,That sharpens insult—I detest the style;      140
2582,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And, now I talk of styles, with what delight"
2583,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"You read my lines—I then, it seems, could write."
2584,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"In short, when I was present you could see"
2585,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But one dear object, and you lived for me;"
2586,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And now, sir, what your pleasure? Let me dress,"
2587,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Sing, speak, or write, and you your sense express"
2588,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Of my poor taste—my words are not correct;      }
2589,_HENRY AND EMMA._,In all I do is failing or defect—      }
2590,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Some error you will seek, some blunder will detect;      }"
2591,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And what can such dissatisfaction prove?      150
2592,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"I tell you, Henry, you have ceased to love."
2593,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ I own it not; but if a truth it be,"
2594,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"It is the fault of nature, not of me."
2595,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Remember you, my love, the fairy tale,"
2596,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Where the young pairs were spell-bound in the vale?
2597,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"When all around them gay or glorious seem’d,"
2598,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And of bright views and ceaseless joys they dream’d;
2599,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Young love and infant life no more could give—
2600,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"They said but half, when they exclaim’d, “We live!”"
2601,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"All was so light, so lovely, so serene,      160"
2602,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And not a trouble to be heard or seen;
2603,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Till, melting into truth, the vision fled,"
2604,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And there came miry roads and thorny ways instead.
2605,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Such was our fate, my charmer! we were found"
2606,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"A wandering pair, by roguish Cupid bound;"
2607,_HENRY AND EMMA._,All that I saw was gifted to inspire      }
2608,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Grand views of bliss, and wake intense desire      }"
2609,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Of joys that never pall, of flights that never tire;      }"
2610,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"There was that purple light of love, that bloom,"
2611,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"That ardent passions in their growth assume,      170"
2612,_HENRY AND EMMA._,That pure enjoyment of the soul—O! weak
2613,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Are words such loves and glowing thoughts to speak!
2614,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"I sought to praise thee, and I felt disdain"
2615,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Of my own effort; all attempts were vain.
2616,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Nor they alone were charming; by that light
2617,_HENRY AND EMMA._,All loved of thee grew lovely in my sight;
2618,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Sweet influence not its own in every place
2619,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Was found, and there was found in all things grace;"
2620,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Thy shrubs and plants were seen new bloom to bear;      }
2621,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Not the Arabian sweets so fragrant were,      180}"
2622,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Nor Eden’s self, if aught with Eden might compare.      }"
2623,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"You went the church-way walk, you reach’d the farm,"
2624,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And gave the grass and babbling springs a charm;
2625,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Crop, whom you rode—sad rider though you be—"
2626,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Thenceforth was more than Pegasus to me.
2627,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Have I not woo’d your snarling cur to bend
2628,_HENRY AND EMMA._,To me the paw and greeting of a friend?
2629,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And all his surly ugliness forgave,"
2630,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Because, like me, he was my Emma’s slave?"
2631,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Think you, thus charm’d, I would the spell revoke?      190"
2632,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Alas! my love, we married, and it broke!"
2633,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Yet no deceit or falsehood stain’d my breast,      }"
2634,_HENRY AND EMMA._,What I asserted might a saint attest;      }
2635,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Fair, dear, and good thou wert, nay, fairest, dearest, best.      }"
2636,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Nor shame, nor guilt, nor falsehood I avow,"
2637,_HENRY AND EMMA._,But ’tis by heaven’s own light I see thee now;
2638,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And if that light will all those glories chase,"
2639,_HENRY AND EMMA._,’Tis not my wish that will the good replace.
2640,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ O! sir, this boyish tale is mighty well,"
2641,_HENRY AND EMMA._,But ’twas your falsehood that destroy’d the spell.      200
2642,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Speak not of nature; ’tis an evil mind      }
2643,_HENRY AND EMMA._,That makes you to accustom’d beauties blind;      }
2644,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"You seek the faults yourself, and then complain you find.      }"
2645,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ I sought them not; but, madam, ’tis in vain"
2646,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The course of love and nature to restrain;
2647,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Lo! when the buds expand the leaves are green,"
2648,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Then the first opening of the flower is seen;
2649,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Then comes the honied breath and rosy smile,"
2650,_HENRY AND EMMA._,That with their sweets the willing sense beguile;
2651,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But, as we look, and love, and taste, and praise,      210"
2652,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And the fruit grows, the charming flower decays;"
2653,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Till all is gather’d, and the wintry blast"
2654,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Moans o’er the place of love and pleasure past.
2655,_HENRY AND EMMA._,So ’tis with beauty—such the opening grace
2656,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And dawn of glory in the youthful face;
2657,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Then are the charms unfolded to the sight,"
2658,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Then all is loveliness and all delight;
2659,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The nuptial tie succeeds, the genial hour,"
2660,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And, lo! the falling off of beauty’s flower;"
2661,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"So, through all nature is the progress made—      220"
2662,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The bud, the bloom, the fruit—and then we fade."
2663,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Then sigh no more—we might as well retain
2664,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The year’s gay prime as bid that love remain:
2665,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"That fond, delusive, happy, transient spell,"
2666,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"That hides us from a world wherein we dwell,"
2667,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And forms and fits us for that fairy ground,"
2668,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Where charming dreams and gay conceits abound;
2669,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Till comes at length th’ awakening strife and care,"
2670,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"That we, as tried and toiling men, must share."
2671,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ O! sir, I must not think that heaven approves      230"
2672,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Ungrateful man or unrequited loves;
2673,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Nor that we less are fitted for our parts
2674,_HENRY AND EMMA._,By having tender souls and feeling hearts.
2675,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ Come, my dear friend, and let us not refuse"
2676,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The good we have, by grief for that we lose;"
2677,_HENRY AND EMMA._,But let us both the very truth confess;
2678,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"This must relieve the ill, and may redress."
2679,_HENRY AND EMMA._,_E._ O! much I fear! I practised no deceit;
2680,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Such as I am I saw you at my feet;
2681,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"If for a goddess you a girl would take,      240"
2682,_HENRY AND EMMA._,’Tis you yourself the disappointment make.
2683,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ And I alone?—O! Emma, when I pray’d"
2684,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"For grace from thee, transported and afraid,"
2685,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Now raised to rapture, now to terror doom’d—"
2686,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Was not the goddess by the girl assumed?
2687,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Did not my Emma use her skill to hide—
2688,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Let us be frank—her weakness and her pride?
2689,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Did she not all her sex’s arts pursue,"
2690,_HENRY AND EMMA._,To bring the angel forward to my view?
2691,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Was not the rising anger oft suppress’d?      250
2692,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Was not the waking passion hush’d to rest?
2693,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And, when so mildly sweet you look’d and spoke,"
2694,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Did not the woman deign to wear a cloak?
2695,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"A cloak she wore, or, though not clear my sight,"
2696,_HENRY AND EMMA._,I might have seen her—Think you not I might?
2697,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ O! this is glorious!—while your passion lives,"
2698,_HENRY AND EMMA._,To the loved maid a robe of grace it gives;
2699,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And then, unjust! beholds her with surprise,"
2700,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Unrobed, ungracious, when the passion dies."
2701,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ For this, my Emma, I to Heaven appeal,      260"
2702,_HENRY AND EMMA._,I felt entirely what I seem’d to feel;
2703,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Thou wert all precious in my sight, to me"
2704,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The being angels are supposed to be;
2705,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And am I now of my deception told,"
2706,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Because I’m doom’d a woman to behold?
2707,_HENRY AND EMMA._,_E._ Sir! in few words I would a question ask—
2708,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Mean these reproaches that I wore a mask?
2709,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Mean you that I by art or caution tried
2710,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To show a virtue, or a fault to hide?"
2711,_HENRY AND EMMA._,_H._ I will obey you—When you seem’d to feel      270
2712,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Those books we read, and praised them with such zeal,"
2713,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Approving all that certain friends approved,"
2714,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Was it the pages, or the praise you loved?"
2715,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Nay, do not frown—I much rejoiced to find"
2716,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Such early judgment in such gentle mind;
2717,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But, since we married, have you deign’d to look"
2718,_HENRY AND EMMA._,On the grave subjects of one favourite book?
2719,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Or have the once-applauded pages power
2720,_HENRY AND EMMA._,T’ engage their warm approver for an hour?
2721,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Nay, hear me further—When we view’d that dell,      280"
2722,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Where lie those ruins—you must know it well—
2723,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"When that worn pediment your walk delay’d,"
2724,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And the stream gushing through the arch decay’d;
2725,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"When at the venerable pile you stood,"
2726,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Till the does ventured on our solitude,"
2727,_HENRY AND EMMA._,We were so still! before the growing day
2728,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Call’d us reluctant from our seat away—
2729,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Tell me, was all the feeling you express’d"
2730,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The genuine feeling of my Emma’s breast?
2731,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Or was it borrow’d, that her faithful slave      290"
2732,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The higher notion of her taste might have?
2733,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"So may I judge, for of that lovely scene"
2734,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The married Emma has no witness been;
2735,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"No more beheld that water, falling, flow"
2736,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Through the green fern that there delights to grow.
2737,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Once more permit me——Well, I know, you feel"
2738,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"For suffering men, and would their sufferings heal,"
2739,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But when at certain huts you chose to call,"
2740,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"At certain seasons, was compassion all?"
2741,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"I there beheld thee, to the wretched dear      300"
2742,_HENRY AND EMMA._,As angels to expiring saints appear
2743,_HENRY AND EMMA._,When whispering hope—I saw an infant press’d
2744,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And hush’d to slumber on my Emma’s breast!
2745,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Hush’d be each rude suggestion!—Well I know,"
2746,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"With a free hand your bounty you bestow,"
2747,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And to these objects frequent comforts send;
2748,_HENRY AND EMMA._,But still they see not now their pitying friend.
2749,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"A merchant, Emma, when his wealth he states,"
2750,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Though rich, is faulty if he over-rates"
2751,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"His real store; and, gaining greater trust      310"
2752,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"For the deception, should we deem him just?"
2753,_HENRY AND EMMA._,If in your singleness of heart you hide
2754,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"No flaw or frailty, when your truth is tried,"
2755,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And time has drawn aside the veil of love—
2756,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"We may be sorry, but we must approve;"
2757,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The fancied charms no more our praise compel,"
2758,_HENRY AND EMMA._,But doubly shines the worth that stands so well.
2759,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ O! precious are you all, and prizes too,"
2760,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Or could we take such guilty pains for you?
2761,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Believe it not—As long as passion lasts,      320"
2762,_HENRY AND EMMA._,A charm about the chosen maid it casts;
2763,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And the poor girl has little more to do
2764,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Than just to keep in sight as you pursue.
2765,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Chance to a ruin leads her; you behold,"
2766,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And straight the angel of her taste is told;
2767,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Chance to a cottage leads you, and you trace"
2768,_HENRY AND EMMA._,A virtuous pity in the angel’s face;
2769,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"She reads a work you chance to recommend,"
2770,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And likes it well—at least, she likes the friend;"
2771,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But, when it chances this no more is done,      330"
2772,_HENRY AND EMMA._,She has not left one virtue—No! not one!
2773,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But be it said, good sir, we use such art,"
2774,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Is it not done to hold a fickle heart,"
2775,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And fix a roving eye?—Is that design
2776,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Shameful or wicked that would keep you mine?
2777,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"If I confess the art, I would proceed"
2778,_HENRY AND EMMA._,To say of such that every maid has need.
2779,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Then, when you flatter—in your language, praise—"
2780,_HENRY AND EMMA._,In our own view you must our value raise;
2781,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And must we not, to this mistaken man,      340"
2782,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Appear as like his picture as we can?
2783,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"If you will call—nay, treat us as—divine,"
2784,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Must we not something to your thoughts incline?
2785,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"If men of sense will worship whom they love,"
2786,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Think you the idol will the error prove?
2787,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"What! show him all her glory is pretence,"
2788,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And make an idiot of this man of sense?
2789,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Then, too, suppose we should his praise refuse,"
2790,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And clear his mind, we may our lover lose;"
2791,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"In fact, you make us more than nature makes,      350"
2792,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And we, no doubt, consent to your mistakes;"
2793,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"You will, we know, until the frenzy cools,"
2794,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Enjoy the transient paradise of fools;
2795,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But, fancy fled, you quit the blissful state,"
2796,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And truth for ever bars the golden gate.
2797,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ True! but how ill each other to upbraid,"
2798,_HENRY AND EMMA._,’Tis not our fault that we no longer staid;
2799,_HENRY AND EMMA._,No sudden fate our lingering love supprest;
2800,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"It died an easy death, and calmly sank to rest."
2801,_HENRY AND EMMA._,To either sex is the delusion lent;      360}
2802,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And, when it fails us, we should rest content;      }"
2803,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"’Tis cruel to reproach, when bootless to repent.      }"
2804,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ Then wise the lovers who consent to wait,"
2805,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And always lingering, never try the state;"
2806,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But hurried on, by what they call their pain"
2807,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And I their bliss, no longer they refrain;"
2808,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To ease that pain, to lose that bliss, they run"
2809,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To the church magi, and the thing is done;"
2810,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"A spell is utter’d, and a ring applied,"
2811,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And forth they walk a bridegroom and a bride,      370"
2812,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To find this counter-charm, this marriage rite,"
2813,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Has put their pleasant fallacies to flight!
2814,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"But tell me, Henry, should we truly strive,"
2815,_HENRY AND EMMA._,May we not bid the happy dream revive?
2816,_HENRY AND EMMA._,_H._ Alas! they say when weakness or when vice
2817,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Expels a foolish pair from Paradise,"
2818,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The guardian power to prayer has no regard;
2819,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The knowledge once obtain’d, the gate is barr’d;"
2820,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Or, could we enter, we should still repine,"
2821,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Unless we could the knowledge too resign.—      380
2822,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Yet let us calmly view our present fate,"
2823,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And make a humbler Eden of our state;
2824,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"With this advantage, that what now we gain,"
2825,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Experience gives, and prudence will retain."
2826,_HENRY AND EMMA._,_E._ Ah! much I doubt—when you in fury broke
2827,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"That lovely vase by one impassion’d stroke,"
2828,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And thousand china-fragments met my sight,"
2829,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Till rising anger put my grief to flight:
2830,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"As well might you the beauteous jar repiece,"
2831,_HENRY AND EMMA._,As joy renew and bid vexation cease.      390
2832,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ Why then ’tis wisdom, Emma, not to keep"
2833,_HENRY AND EMMA._,These griefs in memory; they had better sleep.
2834,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"There was a time when this heaven-guarded isle,"
2835,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Whose valleys flourish—nay, whose mountains smile—"
2836,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Was steril, wild, deform’d, and beings rude"
2837,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Creatures scarce wilder than themselves pursued.
2838,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The sea was heard around a waste to howl;
2839,_HENRY AND EMMA._,The night-wolf answer’d to the whooting owl;
2840,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And all was wretched—Yet who now surveys
2841,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The land, withholds his wonder and his praise?      400"
2842,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Come, let us try and make our moral view"
2843,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Improve like this—this have we power to do.
2844,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_E._ O! I’ll be all forgetful, deaf and dumb,"
2845,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And all you wish, to have these changes come."
2846,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_H._ And come they may; if not as heretofore,"
2847,_HENRY AND EMMA._,We cannot all the lovely vase restore;
2848,_HENRY AND EMMA._,What we beheld in Love’s perspective glass
2849,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Has pass’d away—one sigh! and let it pass.
2850,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"It was a blissful vision, and it fled,"
2851,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And we must get some actual good instead:      410
2852,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Of good and evil that we daily find,"
2853,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"_That_ we must hoard, _this_ banish from the mind;"
2854,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The food of Love, that food on which he thrives,"
2855,_HENRY AND EMMA._,To find must be the business of our lives;
2856,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And when we know what Love delights to see,"
2857,_HENRY AND EMMA._,We must his guardians and providers be.
2858,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"As careful peasants, with incessant toil,"
2859,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Bring earth to vines in bare and rocky soil,"
2860,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"And, as they raise with care each scanty heap,"
2861,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Think of the purple clusters they shall reap:      420
2862,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"So those accretions to the mind we’ll bring,"
2863,_HENRY AND EMMA._,Whence fond regard and just esteem will spring;
2864,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Then, though we backward look with some regret"
2865,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"On those first joys, we shall be happy yet."
2866,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Each on the other must in all depend,"
2867,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"The kind adviser, the unfailing friend;"
2868,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Through the rough world we must each other aid,"
2869,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Leading and led, obeying and obey’d;"
2870,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Favour’d and favouring, eager to believe"
2871,_HENRY AND EMMA._,What should be truth—unwilling to perceive      430
2872,_HENRY AND EMMA._,What might offend—determined to remove      }
2873,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"What has offended, wisely to improve      }"
2874,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"What pleases yet, and guard returning love.      }"
2875,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Nor doubt, my Emma, but in many an hour"
2876,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"Fancy, who sleeps, shall wake with all her power;"
2877,_HENRY AND EMMA._,And we shall pass—though not perhaps remain—
2878,_HENRY AND EMMA._,"To fairy-land, and feel its charm again."

2900,_GRETNA GREEN._,
2901,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“I met,” said Richard, when return’d to dine,"
2902,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“In my excursion, with a friend of mine;"
2903,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Friend! I mistake—but yet I knew him well,"
2904,_GRETNA GREEN._,Ours was the village where he came to dwell;
2905,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He was an orphan born to wealth, and then"
2906,_GRETNA GREEN._,Placed in the guardian-care of cautious men;
2907,_GRETNA GREEN._,"When our good parent, who was kindness all,"
2908,_GRETNA GREEN._,Fed and caress’d him when he chose to call;
2909,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And this he loved, for he was always one"
2910,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For whom some pleasant service must be done,      10"
2911,_GRETNA GREEN._,Or he was sullen—He would come and play
2912,_GRETNA GREEN._,"At his own time, and at his pleasure stay;"
2913,_GRETNA GREEN._,But our kind parent soothed him as a boy      }
2914,_GRETNA GREEN._,Without a friend; she loved he should enjoy      }
2915,_GRETNA GREEN._,"A day of ease, and strove to give his mind employ.      }"
2916,_GRETNA GREEN._,"She had but seldom the desired success,"
2917,_GRETNA GREEN._,And therefore parting troubled her the less;
2918,_GRETNA GREEN._,Two years he there remain’d; then went his way—
2919,_GRETNA GREEN._,I think to school; and him I met to-day.
2920,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“I heard his name, or he had past unknown;      20"
2921,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, without scruple, I divulged my own."
2922,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His words were civil, but not much express’d,"
2923,_GRETNA GREEN._,‘Yes! he had heard I was my brother’s guest’;
2924,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Then would explain, what was not plain to me,"
2925,_GRETNA GREEN._,Why he could not a social neighbour be.
2926,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He envied you, he said, your quiet life,"
2927,_GRETNA GREEN._,And me a loving and contented wife;
2928,_GRETNA GREEN._,"You, as unfetter’d by domestic bond,"
2929,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Me, as a husband and a father fond."
2930,_GRETNA GREEN._,"I was about to speak, when to the right      30"
2931,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The road then turn’d, and lo! his house in sight."
2932,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“‘Adieu!’ he said, nor gave a word or sign"
2933,_GRETNA GREEN._,Of invitation—‘Yonder house is mine;
2934,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Your brother’s I prefer, if I might choose—"
2935,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But, my dear sir, you have no time to lose.’"
2936,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Say, is he poor? or has he fits of spleen?"
2937,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Or is he melancholy, moped, or mean?"
2938,_GRETNA GREEN._,"So cold, so distant——I bestow’d some pains"
2939,_GRETNA GREEN._,Upon the fever in my Irish veins.”—
2940,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Well, Richard, let your native wrath be tamed;      40"
2941,_GRETNA GREEN._,The man has half the evils you have named:
2942,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He is not poor, indeed, nor is he free"
2943,_GRETNA GREEN._,From all the gloom and care of poverty.”—
2944,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“But is he married?”—“Hush! the bell, my friend;"
2945,_GRETNA GREEN._,"That business done, we will to this attend;"
2946,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, o’er our wine engaged, and at our ease,"
2947,_GRETNA GREEN._,We may discourse of Belwood’s miseries;
2948,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Not that his sufferings please me—No, indeed;"
2949,_GRETNA GREEN._,But I from such am happy to be freed.”
2950,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Their speech, of course, to this misfortune led      50"
2951,_GRETNA GREEN._,A weak young man improvidently wed.
2952,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Weak,” answer’d Richard; “but we do him wrong"
2953,_GRETNA GREEN._,To say that his affection was not strong.”
2954,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“That we may doubt,” said George; “in men so weak"
2955,_GRETNA GREEN._,You may in vain the strong affections seek;
2956,_GRETNA GREEN._,They have strong appetites; a fool will eat
2957,_GRETNA GREEN._,As long as food is to his palate sweet;
2958,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His rule is not what sober nature needs,"
2959,_GRETNA GREEN._,But what the palate covets as he feeds;
2960,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He has the passions, anger, envy, fear,      60"
2961,_GRETNA GREEN._,"As storm is angry, and as frost severe;"
2962,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Uncheck’d, he still retains what nature gave,"
2963,_GRETNA GREEN._,And has what creatures of the forest have.
2964,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Weak boys, indulged by parents just as weak,"
2965,_GRETNA GREEN._,Will with much force of their affection speak;
2966,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But let mamma th’ accustom’d sweets withhold,"
2967,_GRETNA GREEN._,And the fond boys grow insolent and cold.
2968,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Weak men profess to love, and while untried"
2969,_GRETNA GREEN._,"May woo with warmth, and grieve to be denied;"
2970,_GRETNA GREEN._,But this is selfish ardour—all the zeal      70
2971,_GRETNA GREEN._,Of their pursuit is from the wish they feel
2972,_GRETNA GREEN._,For self indulgence—When do they deny      }
2973,_GRETNA GREEN._,Themselves? and when the favourite object fly?      }
2974,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Or, for that object’s sake, with her requests comply?      }"
2975,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Their sickly love is fed with hopes of joy,"
2976,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Repulses damp it, and delays destroy;"
2977,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Love, that to virtuous acts will some excite,"
2978,_GRETNA GREEN._,In others but provokes an appetite.
2979,_GRETNA GREEN._,"In better minds, when love possession takes"
2980,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And meets with peril, he the reason shakes;      80"
2981,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But these weak natures, when they love profess,"
2982,_GRETNA GREEN._,Never regard their small concerns the less.
2983,_GRETNA GREEN._,“That true and genuine love has Quixote-flights
2984,_GRETNA GREEN._,May be allow’d—in vision it delights;
2985,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But, in its loftiest flight, its wildest dream"
2986,_GRETNA GREEN._,Has something in it that commands esteem.
2987,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But this poor love to no such region soars,"
2988,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But, Sancho-like, its selfish loss deplores;"
2989,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Of its own merit and its service speaks,"
2990,_GRETNA GREEN._,And full reward for all its duty seeks.”—      90
2991,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“When a rich boy, with all the pride of youth,"
2992,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Weds a poor beauty, will you doubt his truth?"
2993,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Such love is tried—it indiscreet may be,"
2994,_GRETNA GREEN._,But must be generous”—
2995,_GRETNA GREEN._,“That I do not see.
2996,_GRETNA GREEN._,Just at this time the balance of the mind
2997,_GRETNA GREEN._,Is this or that way by the weights inclined;
2998,_GRETNA GREEN._,"In this scale beauty, wealth in that abides,"
2999,_GRETNA GREEN._,"In dubious balance, till the last subsides;"
3000,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Things are not poised in just the equal state,"
3001,_GRETNA GREEN._,That the ass stands stock-still in the debate;      100
3002,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Though, when deciding, he may slowly pass"
3003,_GRETNA GREEN._,And long for both—the nature of the ass;
3004,_GRETNA GREEN._,"’Tis but an impulse that he must obey,"
3005,_GRETNA GREEN._,When he resigns one bundle of the hay.”

3008,_GRETNA GREEN._,
3009,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Take your friend Belwood, whom his guardians sent"
3010,_GRETNA GREEN._,To Doctor Sidmere—full of dread he went;
3011,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Doctor they call’d him—he was not of us,"
3012,_GRETNA GREEN._,And where he was—we need not now discuss.
3013,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He kept a school; he had a daughter fair,"
3014,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He said, as angels—say, as women—are.      110"
3015,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Clara, this beauty, had a figure light;"
3016,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Her face was handsome, and her eyes were bright;"
3017,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Her voice was music, not by anger raised;"
3018,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And sweet her dimple, either pleased or praised;"
3019,_GRETNA GREEN._,All round the village was her fame allow’d;
3020,_GRETNA GREEN._,"She was its pride, and not a little proud."
3021,_GRETNA GREEN._,The ruling thought that sway’d her father’s mind
3022,_GRETNA GREEN._,Was this—I am for dignity design’d.
3023,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Riches he rather as a mean approved,"
3024,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Yet sought them early, and in seeking loved;      120"
3025,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For this he early made the marriage vow,"
3026,_GRETNA GREEN._,But fail’d to gain—I recollect not how;
3027,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For this his lady had his wrath incurr’d,"
3028,_GRETNA GREEN._,But that her feelings seldom could be stirr’d;
3029,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To his fair daughter, famed as well as fair,"
3030,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He look’d, and found his consolation there."
3031,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The Doctor taught of youth some half a score,"
3032,_GRETNA GREEN._,Well-born and wealthy—He would take no more;
3033,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His wife, when peevish, told him, “Yes! and glad”—"
3034,_GRETNA GREEN._,It might be so—no more were to be had.      130
3035,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Belwood, it seems, for college was design’d,"
3036,_GRETNA GREEN._,But for more study he was not inclined;
3037,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He thought of labouring there with much dismay,"
3038,_GRETNA GREEN._,And motives mix’d here urged the long delay.
3039,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He now on manhood verged, at least began"
3040,_GRETNA GREEN._,To talk as he supposed became a man.
3041,_GRETNA GREEN._,“Whether he chose the college or the school
3042,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Was his own act, and that should no man rule;"
3043,_GRETNA GREEN._,He had his reasons for the step he took;
3044,_GRETNA GREEN._,Did they suppose he stay’d to read his book?”      140
3045,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Hopeless, the Doctor said, “This boy is one"
3046,_GRETNA GREEN._,With whom I fear there’s nothing to be done.”
3047,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His wife replied, who more had guess’d or knew,"
3048,_GRETNA GREEN._,“You only mean there’s nothing he can do;
3049,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Ev’n there you err, unless you mean indeed"
3050,_GRETNA GREEN._,That the poor lad can neither think nor read.”—
3051,_GRETNA GREEN._,“What credit can I by such dunce obtain?”—
3052,_GRETNA GREEN._,“Credit? I know not—you may something gain;
3053,_GRETNA GREEN._,"’Tis true he has no passion for his books,"
3054,_GRETNA GREEN._,But none can closer study Clara’s looks;      150
3055,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And who controls him? now his father’s gone,"
3056,_GRETNA GREEN._,There’s not a creature cares about the son.
3057,_GRETNA GREEN._,"If he be brought to ask your daughter’s hand,"
3058,_GRETNA GREEN._,All that he has will be at her command;
3059,_GRETNA GREEN._,And who is she? and whom does she obey?
3060,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Where is the wrong, and what the danger, pray?"
3061,_GRETNA GREEN._,Becoming guide to one who guidance needs
3062,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Is merit surely—If the thing succeeds,"
3063,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Cannot you always keep him at your side,"
3064,_GRETNA GREEN._,And be his honour’d guardian and his guide?      160
3065,_GRETNA GREEN._,And cannot I my pretty Clara rule?
3066,_GRETNA GREEN._,Is not this better than a noisy school?”
3067,_GRETNA GREEN._,The Doctor thought and mused; he felt and fear’d;
3068,_GRETNA GREEN._,Wish’d it to be—then wish’d he had not heard;
3069,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But he was angry—that at least was right,"
3070,_GRETNA GREEN._,And gave him credit in his lady’s sight;—
3071,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Then, milder grown, yet something still severe,"
3072,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He said, “Consider, Madam, think and fear;”"
3073,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But, ere they parted, softening to a smile,"
3074,_GRETNA GREEN._,“Farewell!” said he—“I’ll think myself awhile.”      170
3075,_GRETNA GREEN._,"James and his Clara had, with many a pause"
3076,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And many a doubt, infringed the Doctor’s laws;"
3077,_GRETNA GREEN._,"At first with terror, and with eyes turn’d round"
3078,_GRETNA GREEN._,"On every side for fear they should be found,"
3079,_GRETNA GREEN._,"In the long passage, and without the gate,"
3080,_GRETNA GREEN._,"They met, and talk’d of love and his estate;"
3081,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Sweet little notes, and full of hope, were laid"
3082,_GRETNA GREEN._,Where they were found by the attentive maid;
3083,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And these she answer’d kindly as she could,"
3084,_GRETNA GREEN._,But still ‘I dare not’ waited on ‘I would;’      180
3085,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Her fears and wishes she in part confess’d,"
3086,_GRETNA GREEN._,Her thoughts and views she carefully suppress’d;
3087,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Her Jemmy said at length, “He did not heed"
3088,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His guardian’s anger—What was he, indeed?"
3089,_GRETNA GREEN._,"A tradesman once, and had his fortune gain’d"
3090,_GRETNA GREEN._,In that low way—such anger he disdain’d—
3091,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He loved her pretty looks, her eyes of blue,"
3092,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Her auburn-braid, and lips that shone like dew;"
3093,_GRETNA GREEN._,And did she think her Jemmy stay’d at school
3094,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To study Greek?—What, take him for a fool?      190"
3095,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Not he, by Jove! for what he had to seek"
3096,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He would in English ask her, not in Greek;"
3097,_GRETNA GREEN._,Will you be mine? are all your scruples gone?
3098,_GRETNA GREEN._,Then let’s be off—I’ve that will take us on.”
3099,_GRETNA GREEN._,’Twas true; the clerk of an attorney there
3100,_GRETNA GREEN._,Had found a Jew—the Jew supplied the heir.
3101,_GRETNA GREEN._,Yet had he fears—“My guardians may condemn
3102,_GRETNA GREEN._,The choice I make—but what is that to them?
3103,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The more they strive my pleasure to restrain,"
3104,_GRETNA GREEN._,The less they’ll find they’re likely to obtain;      200
3105,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For when they work one to a proper cue,"
3106,_GRETNA GREEN._,What they forbid one takes delight to do.”
3107,_GRETNA GREEN._,Clara exulted—now the day would come
3108,_GRETNA GREEN._,Belwood must take her in her carriage home;
3109,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Then I shall hear what Envy will remark,"
3110,_GRETNA GREEN._,When I shall sport the ponies in the park;
3111,_GRETNA GREEN._,"When my friend Jane will meet me at the ball,"
3112,_GRETNA GREEN._,And see me taken out the first of all;
3113,_GRETNA GREEN._,I see her looks when she beholds the men
3114,_GRETNA GREEN._,"All crowd about me—she will simper then,      210"
3115,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And cry with her affected air and voice,"
3116,_GRETNA GREEN._,"‘O! my sweet Clara, how do I rejoice"
3117,_GRETNA GREEN._,"At your good fortune!’—‘Thank you, dear,’ say I;"
3118,_GRETNA GREEN._,‘But some there are that could for envy die.’”
3119,_GRETNA GREEN._,Mamma look’d on with thoughts to these allied;
3120,_GRETNA GREEN._,She felt the pleasure of reflected pride;
3121,_GRETNA GREEN._,She should respect in Clara’s honour find—
3122,_GRETNA GREEN._,But she to Clara’s secret thoughts was blind;
3123,_GRETNA GREEN._,O! when we thus design we do but spread
3124,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Nets for our feet, and to our toils are led;      220"
3125,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Those whom we think we rule their views attain,"
3126,_GRETNA GREEN._,And we partake the guilt without the gain.
3127,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The Doctor long had thought, till he became"
3128,_GRETNA GREEN._,A victim both to avarice and shame;
3129,_GRETNA GREEN._,"From his importance, every eye was placed"
3130,_GRETNA GREEN._,On his designs—How dreadful if disgraced!
3131,_GRETNA GREEN._,“O! that unknown to him the pair had flown
3132,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To that same Green, the project all their own!"
3133,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, should they now be guilty of the act,"
3134,_GRETNA GREEN._,Am not I free from knowledge of the fact?      230
3135,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Will they not, if they will?”—’Tis thus we meet"
3136,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The check of conscience, and our guide defeat."
3137,_GRETNA GREEN._,"This friend, this spy, this counsellor at rest,"
3138,_GRETNA GREEN._,More pleasing views were to the mind address’d.
3139,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The mischief done, he would be much displeased,"
3140,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For weeks, nay, months, and slowly be appeased—"
3141,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Yet of this anger if they felt the dread,"
3142,_GRETNA GREEN._,Perhaps they dare not steal away to wed;
3143,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, if on hints of mercy they should go,"
3144,_GRETNA GREEN._,He stood committed—it must not be so.      240
3145,_GRETNA GREEN._,In this dilemma either horn was hard—
3146,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Best to seem careless, then, and off one’s guard;"
3147,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, lest their terror should their flight prevent,"
3148,_GRETNA GREEN._,His wife might argue—fathers will relent
3149,_GRETNA GREEN._,On such occasions—and that she should share
3150,_GRETNA GREEN._,The guilt and censure was her proper care.
3151,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Suppose them wed,” said he, “and at my feet,"
3152,_GRETNA GREEN._,I must exclaim that instant—‘Vile deceit!’
3153,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Then will my daughter, weeping while they kneel,"
3154,_GRETNA GREEN._,For its own Clara beg my heart may feel:      250
3155,_GRETNA GREEN._,"At last, but slowly, I may all forgive,"
3156,_GRETNA GREEN._,And their adviser and director live.”
3157,_GRETNA GREEN._,"When wishes only weak the heart surprise,"
3158,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Heaven, in its mercy, the fond prayer denies;"
3159,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But when our wishes are both base and weak,"
3160,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Heaven, in its justice, gives us what we seek."
3161,_GRETNA GREEN._,All pass’d that was expected; all prepared
3162,_GRETNA GREEN._,To share the comfort—What the comfort shared?
3163,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The married pair, on their return, agreed"
3164,_GRETNA GREEN._,That they from school were now completely freed;      260
3165,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Were man and wife, and to their mansion now"
3166,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Should boldly drive, and their intents avow:"
3167,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The acting guardian in the mansion reign’d,"
3168,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, thither driving, they their will explain’d."
3169,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The man awhile discoursed in language high,"
3170,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The ward was sullen, and made brief reply;"
3171,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Till, when he saw th’ opposing strength decline,"
3172,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He bravely utter’d—“Sir, the house is mine!”"
3173,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, like a lion, lash’d by self-rebuke,"
3174,_GRETNA GREEN._,His own defence he bravely undertook.      270
3175,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Well! be it right or wrong, the thing is past;"
3176,_GRETNA GREEN._,You cannot hinder what is tight and fast:
3177,_GRETNA GREEN._,The church has tied us; we are hither come
3178,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To our own place, and you must make us room.”"
3179,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The man reflected—“You deserve, I know,"
3180,_GRETNA GREEN._,Foolish young man! what fortune will bestow;
3181,_GRETNA GREEN._,"No punishment from me your actions need,"
3182,_GRETNA GREEN._,Whose pains will shortly to your fault succeed.”
3183,_GRETNA GREEN._,"James was quite angry, wondering what was meant"
3184,_GRETNA GREEN._,By such expressions—Why should he repent?      280
3185,_GRETNA GREEN._,New trial came—The wife conceived it right
3186,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To see her parents; “So,” he said, “she might,"
3187,_GRETNA GREEN._,"If she had any fancy for a jail,"
3188,_GRETNA GREEN._,But upon him no creature should prevail;
3189,_GRETNA GREEN._,No! he would never be again the fool
3190,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To go and starve, or study at a school!”—"
3191,_GRETNA GREEN._,“O! but to see her parents!”—“Well! the sight
3192,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Might give her pleasure—very like it might,"
3193,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And she might go; but, to his house restored,"
3194,_GRETNA GREEN._,He would not now be catechised and bored.”—      290
3195,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“It was her duty”—“Well!” said he again,"
3196,_GRETNA GREEN._,“There you may go—and there you may remain!”
3197,_GRETNA GREEN._,Already this?—Even so: he heard it said
3198,_GRETNA GREEN._,How rash and heedless was the part he play’d;
3199,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For love of money in his spirit dwelt,"
3200,_GRETNA GREEN._,And there repentance was intensely felt.
3201,_GRETNA GREEN._,His guardian told him he had bought a toy
3202,_GRETNA GREEN._,"At tenfold price, and bargain’d like a boy;"
3203,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Angry at truth, and wrought to fierce disdain,"
3204,_GRETNA GREEN._,He swore his loss should be no woman’s gain;      300
3205,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His table she might share, his name she must;"
3206,_GRETNA GREEN._,But if aught more—she gets it upon trust.
3207,_GRETNA GREEN._,For a few weeks his pride her face display’d—
3208,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He then began to thwart her, and upbraid;"
3209,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He grew imperious, insolent, and loud—"
3210,_GRETNA GREEN._,His blinded weakness made his folly proud;
3211,_GRETNA GREEN._,He would be master—she had no pretence
3212,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To counsel him, as if he wanted sense;"
3213,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He must inform her, she already cost"
3214,_GRETNA GREEN._,"More than her worth, and more should not be lost;      310"
3215,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But still concluding, “if your will be so"
3216,_GRETNA GREEN._,"That you must see the old ones, do it—go!”"
3217,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Some weeks the Doctor waited, and the while"
3218,_GRETNA GREEN._,His lady preach’d in no consoling style;
3219,_GRETNA GREEN._,At last she fear’d that rustic had convey’d
3220,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Their child to prison—yes, she was afraid,—"
3221,_GRETNA GREEN._,There to remain in that old hall alone
3222,_GRETNA GREEN._,"With the vile heads of stags, and floors of stone."
3223,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Why did you, sir, who know such things so well,"
3224,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And teach us good, permit them to rebel?      320"
3225,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Had you o’erawed and check’d them when in sight,"
3226,_GRETNA GREEN._,They would not then have ventured upon flight—
3227,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Had you”——“Out, serpent! did not you begin?"
3228,_GRETNA GREEN._,"What! introduce, and then upbraid, the sin?"
3229,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For sin it is, as I too well perceive;"
3230,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But leave me, woman, to reflection leave;"
3231,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Then to your closet fly, and on your knees"
3232,_GRETNA GREEN._,Beg for forgiveness for such sins as these.”
3233,_GRETNA GREEN._,“A moody morning!” with a careless air
3234,_GRETNA GREEN._,Replied the wife—“Why counsel me to prayer?      330
3235,_GRETNA GREEN._,I think the lord and teacher of a school
3236,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Should pray himself, and keep his temper cool.”"
3237,_GRETNA GREEN._,Calm grew the husband when the wife was gone—
3238,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“The game,” said he, “is never lost till won."
3239,_GRETNA GREEN._,"’Tis true, the rebels fly their proper home,"
3240,_GRETNA GREEN._,"They come not nigh, because they fear to come;"
3241,_GRETNA GREEN._,And for my purpose fear will doubtless prove
3242,_GRETNA GREEN._,Of more importance and effect than love.—
3243,_GRETNA GREEN._,Suppose me there—suppose the carriage stops:
3244,_GRETNA GREEN._,Down on her knees my trembling daughter drops;      340
3245,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Slowly I raise her, in my arms to fall,"
3246,_GRETNA GREEN._,And call for mercy as she used to call;
3247,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And shall that boy, who dreaded to appear"
3248,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Before me, cast away at once his fear?"
3249,_GRETNA GREEN._,’Tis not in nature! He who once would cower
3250,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Beneath my frown, and sob for half an hour;"
3251,_GRETNA GREEN._,He who would kneel with motion prompt and quick
3252,_GRETNA GREEN._,If I but look’d—as dogs that do a trick;
3253,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He still his knee-joints flexible must feel,"
3254,_GRETNA GREEN._,And have a slavish promptitude to kneel;      350
3255,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Soon as he sees me he will drop his lip,"
3256,_GRETNA GREEN._,And bend like one made ready for the whip.
3257,_GRETNA GREEN._,"O! come, I trifle, let me haste away—"
3258,_GRETNA GREEN._,"What! throw it up, when I have cards to play?”"
3259,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The Doctor went, a self-invited guest;"
3260,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He met his pupil, and his frown repress’d,"
3261,_GRETNA GREEN._,For in those lowering looks he could discern
3262,_GRETNA GREEN._,Resistance sullen and defiance stern;
3263,_GRETNA GREEN._,Yet was it painful to put off his style
3264,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Of awful distance, and assume a smile:      360"
3265,_GRETNA GREEN._,"So between these, the gracious and the grand,"
3266,_GRETNA GREEN._,Succeeded nothing that the Doctor plann’d.
3267,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The sullen youth, with some reviving dread,"
3268,_GRETNA GREEN._,Bow’d and then hang’d disconsolate his head;
3269,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, muttering welcome in a muffled tone,"
3270,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Stalk’d cross the park to meditate alone,"
3271,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Saying, or rather seeming to have said,"
3272,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Go! seek your daughter, and be there obey’d.”"
3273,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He went—The daughter her distresses told,"
3274,_GRETNA GREEN._,But found her father to her interests cold;      370
3275,_GRETNA GREEN._,He kindness and complacency advised;
3276,_GRETNA GREEN._,"She answer’d, “these were sure to be despised;"
3277,_GRETNA GREEN._,That of the love her husband once possess’d
3278,_GRETNA GREEN._,Not the least spark was living in his breast;
3279,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The boy repented, and grew savage soon;"
3280,_GRETNA GREEN._,There never shone for her a honey-moon.
3281,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Soon as he came, his cares all fix’d on one—"
3282,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Himself, and all his passion was a gun;"
3283,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, though he shot as he did all beside,"
3284,_GRETNA GREEN._,It still remained his only joy and pride.      380
3285,_GRETNA GREEN._,He left her there—she knew not where he went—
3286,_GRETNA GREEN._,But knew full well he should the slight repent;
3287,_GRETNA GREEN._,"She was not one his daily taunts to bear,"
3288,_GRETNA GREEN._,He made the house a hell that he should share;
3289,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For, till he gave her power herself to please,"
3290,_GRETNA GREEN._,Never for him should be a moment’s ease.”
3291,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“He loves you, child!” the softening father cried.—"
3292,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He loves himself, and not a soul beside."
3293,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Loves me!—why, yes, and so he did the pears"
3294,_GRETNA GREEN._,You caught him stealing—would he had the fears!      390
3295,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Would you could make him tremble for his life,"
3296,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And then to you return the stolen wife,"
3297,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Richly endow’d—but, O! the idiot knows"
3298,_GRETNA GREEN._,The worth of every penny he bestows.
3299,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Were he but fool alone, I’d find a way"
3300,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To govern him, at least to have my day;"
3301,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Or were he only brute, I’d watch the hour,"
3302,_GRETNA GREEN._,And make the brute-affection yield me power;
3303,_GRETNA GREEN._,But silly both and savage—O! my heart!
3304,_GRETNA GREEN._,It is too great a trial!—we must part.”—      400
3305,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Oblige the savage by some act!”—“The debt,"
3306,_GRETNA GREEN._,"You find, the fool will instantly forget;"
3307,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Oblige the fool with kindness or with praise,"
3308,_GRETNA GREEN._,And you the passions of the savage raise.”—
3309,_GRETNA GREEN._,“Time will do much.”—“Can time my name restore?”—
3310,_GRETNA GREEN._,"“Have patience, child.”—“I am a child no more,"
3311,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Nor more dependent; but, at woman’s age,"
3312,_GRETNA GREEN._,I feel that wrongs provoke me and enrage.
3313,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Sir, could you bring me comfort, I were cool;"
3314,_GRETNA GREEN._,But keep your counsel for your boys at school.”      410
3315,_GRETNA GREEN._,The Doctor then departed—Why remain      }
3316,_GRETNA GREEN._,"To hear complaints, who could himself complain,      }"
3317,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Who felt his actions wrong, and knew his efforts vain?      }"
3318,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The sullen youth, contending with his fate,"
3319,_GRETNA GREEN._,Began the darling of his heart to hate;
3320,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Her pretty looks, her auburn braid, her face,"
3321,_GRETNA GREEN._,All now remain’d the proofs of his disgrace;
3322,_GRETNA GREEN._,"While, more than hateful in his vixen’s eyes,"
3323,_GRETNA GREEN._,He saw her comforts from his griefs arise;
3324,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Who felt a joy she strove not to conceal,      420"
3325,_GRETNA GREEN._,When their expenses made her miser feel.
3326,_GRETNA GREEN._,War was perpetual: on a first attack
3327,_GRETNA GREEN._,"She gain’d advantage, he would turn his back;"
3328,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And, when her small-shot whistled in his ears,"
3329,_GRETNA GREEN._,He felt a portion of his early fears;
3330,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But, if he turn’d him in the battle’s heat,"
3331,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And fought in earnest, hers was then defeat;"
3332,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His strength of oath and curse brought little harm,"
3333,_GRETNA GREEN._,But there was no resisting strength of arm.
3334,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Yet wearied both with war, and vex’d at heart,      430"
3335,_GRETNA GREEN._,The slaves of passion judged it best to part.
3336,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Long they debated, nor could fix a rate"
3337,_GRETNA GREEN._,For a man’s peace with his contending mate;
3338,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But mutual hatred, scorn, and fear, assign’d"
3339,_GRETNA GREEN._,That price—that peace it was not theirs to find.
3340,_GRETNA GREEN._,The watchful husband lived in constant hope
3341,_GRETNA GREEN._,To hear the wife had ventured to elope;
3342,_GRETNA GREEN._,"But, though not virtuous, nor in much discreet,"
3343,_GRETNA GREEN._,He found her coldness would such views defeat;
3344,_GRETNA GREEN._,"And thus, by self-reproof and avarice scourged,      440"
3345,_GRETNA GREEN._,He wore the galling chains his folly forged.
3346,_GRETNA GREEN._,"The wife her pleasures, few and humble, sought,"
3347,_GRETNA GREEN._,And with anticipated stipend bought;
3348,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Without a home, at fashion’s call she fled"
3349,_GRETNA GREEN._,To an hired lodging and a widow’d bed;
3350,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Husband and parents banish’d from her mind,"
3351,_GRETNA GREEN._,She seeks for pleasures that she cannot find;
3352,_GRETNA GREEN._,And grieves that so much treachery was employ’d
3353,_GRETNA GREEN._,To gain a man who has her peace destroy’d.
3354,_GRETNA GREEN._,"Yet more the grieving father feels distress,      450"
3355,_GRETNA GREEN._,"His error greater, and his motives less;"
3356,_GRETNA GREEN._,"He finds too late, by stooping to deceit,"
3357,_GRETNA GREEN._,It is ourselves and not the world we cheat;
3358,_GRETNA GREEN._,"For, though we blind it, yet we can but feel"
3359,_GRETNA GREEN._,That we have something evil to conceal;
3360,_GRETNA GREEN._,Nor can we by our utmost care be sure
3361,_GRETNA GREEN._,That we can hide the sufferings we endure.

4390,_THE WIDOW._,_THE WIDOW._
4391,_THE WIDOW._,
4392,_THE WIDOW._,Richard one morning—it was custom now—
4393,_THE WIDOW._,Walk’d and conversed with labourers at the plough;
4394,_THE WIDOW._,With thrashers hastening to their daily task;
4395,_THE WIDOW._,With woodmen resting o’er the enlivening flask;
4396,_THE WIDOW._,"And with the shepherd, watchful of his fold"
4397,_THE WIDOW._,"Beneath the hill, and pacing in the cold."
4398,_THE WIDOW._,"Further afield he sometimes would proceed,"
4399,_THE WIDOW._,"And take a path, wherever it might lead."
4400,_THE WIDOW._,"It led him far about to Wickham Green,"
4401,_THE WIDOW._,Where stood the mansion of the village queen;      10
4402,_THE WIDOW._,"Her garden yet its wintry blossoms bore,"
4403,_THE WIDOW._,And roses graced the windows and the door—
4404,_THE WIDOW._,"That lasting kind, that through the varying year,"
4405,_THE WIDOW._,"Or in the bud or in the bloom, appear;"
4406,_THE WIDOW._,All flowers that now the gloomy days adorn
4407,_THE WIDOW._,"Rose on the view, and smiled upon that morn."
4408,_THE WIDOW._,"Richard a damsel at the window spied,"
4409,_THE WIDOW._,"Who kindly drew a useless veil aside,"
4410,_THE WIDOW._,"And show’d a lady who was sitting by,"
4411,_THE WIDOW._,"So pensive, that he almost heard her sigh;      20"
4412,_THE WIDOW._,"Full many years she could, no question, tell,"
4413,_THE WIDOW._,But in her mourning look’d extremely well.
4414,_THE WIDOW._,"“In truth,” said Richard, when he told at night"
4415,_THE WIDOW._,"His tale to George, “it was a pleasant sight;"
4416,_THE WIDOW._,"She look’d like one who could, in tender tone,"
4417,_THE WIDOW._,"Say, ‘Will you let a lady sigh alone?"
4418,_THE WIDOW._,"See! Time has touch’d me gently in his race,"
4419,_THE WIDOW._,And left no odious furrows in my face;
4420,_THE WIDOW._,"See, too, this house and garden, neat and trim,"
4421,_THE WIDOW._,Kept for its master——Will you stand for him?’      30
4422,_THE WIDOW._,"“Say this is vain and foolish if you please,"
4423,_THE WIDOW._,But I believe her thoughts resembled these.
4424,_THE WIDOW._,"‘Come!’ said her looks, ‘and we will kindly take"
4425,_THE WIDOW._,The visit kindness prompted you to make.’
4426,_THE WIDOW._,And I was sorry that so much good play      }
4427,_THE WIDOW._,Of eye and attitude were thrown away      }
4428,_THE WIDOW._,"On one who has his lot, on one who had his day.”      }"
4429,_THE WIDOW._,"“Your pity, brother,” George, with smile, replied,"
4430,_THE WIDOW._,"You may dismiss, and with it send your pride:"
4431,_THE WIDOW._,"No need of pity, when the gentle dame      40"
4432,_THE WIDOW._,Has thrice resign’d and reassumed her name;
4433,_THE WIDOW._,"And be not proud—for, though it might be thine,"
4434,_THE WIDOW._,She would that hand to humbler men resign.
4435,_THE WIDOW._,"“Young she is not,—it would be passing strange"
4436,_THE WIDOW._,If a young beauty thrice her name should change.
4437,_THE WIDOW._,Yes! she has years beyond your reckoning seen—
4438,_THE WIDOW._,Smiles and a window years and wrinkles screen;
4439,_THE WIDOW._,"But she, in fact, has that which may command"
4440,_THE WIDOW._,The warm admirer and the willing hand:
4441,_THE WIDOW._,"What is her fortune we are left to guess,      50"
4442,_THE WIDOW._,But good the sign—she does not much profess.
4443,_THE WIDOW._,Poor she is not—and there is that in her
4444,_THE WIDOW._,That easy men to strength of mind prefer;
4445,_THE WIDOW._,"She may be made, with little care and skill,"
4446,_THE WIDOW._,"Yielding her own, t’adopt an husband’s will."
4447,_THE WIDOW._,"Women there are, who of a man will take"
4448,_THE WIDOW._,The helm and steer—will no resistance make;
4449,_THE WIDOW._,"Who, if neglected, will the power assume,"
4450,_THE WIDOW._,And then what wonder if the shipwreck come?
4451,_THE WIDOW._,"Queens they will be, if man allow the means,      60"
4452,_THE WIDOW._,And give the power to these domestic queens;
4453,_THE WIDOW._,"Whom, if he rightly trains, he may create"
4454,_THE WIDOW._,And make obedient members of his state.”

4457,_THE WIDOW._,
4458,_THE WIDOW._,Harriet at school was very much the same
4459,_THE WIDOW._,"As other misses; and so home she came,"
4460,_THE WIDOW._,"Like other ladies, there to live and learn,"
4461,_THE WIDOW._,"To wait her season, and to take her turn."
4462,_THE WIDOW._,Their husbands maids as priests their livings gain:
4463,_THE WIDOW._,"The best, they find, are hardest to obtain."
4464,_THE WIDOW._,On those that offer both awhile debate—      70
4465,_THE WIDOW._,"“I need not take it, it is not so late;"
4466,_THE WIDOW._,"Better will come if we will longer stay,"
4467,_THE WIDOW._,And strive to put ourselves in fortune’s way:”
4468,_THE WIDOW._,"And thus they wait, till many years are past,"
4469,_THE WIDOW._,For what comes slowly—_but it comes at last_.
4470,_THE WIDOW._,"Harriet was wedded,—but it must be said,"
4471,_THE WIDOW._,The vow’d obedience was not duly paid.
4472,_THE WIDOW._,Hers was an easy man—it gave him pain
4473,_THE WIDOW._,To hear a lady murmur and complain;
4474,_THE WIDOW._,"He was a merchant, whom his father made      80"
4475,_THE WIDOW._,Rich in the gains of a successful trade;
4476,_THE WIDOW._,"A lot more pleasant, or a view more fair,"
4477,_THE WIDOW._,Has seldom fallen to a youthful pair.
4478,_THE WIDOW._,But what is faultless in a world like this?
4479,_THE WIDOW._,In every station something seems amiss.
4480,_THE WIDOW._,"The lady, married, found the house too small—"
4481,_THE WIDOW._,"“Two shabby parlours, and that ugly hall!"
4482,_THE WIDOW._,"Had we a cottage somewhere, and could meet"
4483,_THE WIDOW._,One’s friends and favourites in one’s snug retreat;
4484,_THE WIDOW._,"Or only join a single room to these,      90}"
4485,_THE WIDOW._,"It would be living something at our ease,      }"
4486,_THE WIDOW._,"And have one’s self, at home, the comfort that one sees.”      }"
4487,_THE WIDOW._,"Such powers of reason, and of mind such strength,"
4488,_THE WIDOW._,"Fought with man’s fear, and they prevail’d at length."
4489,_THE WIDOW._,The room was built—and Harriet did not know
4490,_THE WIDOW._,"A prettier dwelling, either high or low;"
4491,_THE WIDOW._,"But Harriet loved such conquests, loved to plead"
4492,_THE WIDOW._,"With her reluctant man, and to succeed;"
4493,_THE WIDOW._,It was such pleasure to prevail o’er one      }
4494,_THE WIDOW._,Who would oppose the thing that still was done;      100}
4495,_THE WIDOW._,"Who never gain’d the race, but yet would groan and run.      }"
4496,_THE WIDOW._,But there were times when love and pity gave
4497,_THE WIDOW._,Whatever thoughtless vanity could crave.
4498,_THE WIDOW._,"She now the carriage chose with freshest name,"
4499,_THE WIDOW._,And was in quite a fever till it came;
4500,_THE WIDOW._,But can a carriage be alone enjoy’d?
4501,_THE WIDOW._,The pleasure not partaken is destroy’d;
4502,_THE WIDOW._,“I must have some good creature to attend
4503,_THE WIDOW._,On morning visits as a kind of friend.”
4504,_THE WIDOW._,A courteous maiden then was found to sit      110
4505,_THE WIDOW._,"Beside the lady, for her purpose fit:"
4506,_THE WIDOW._,Who had been train’d in all the soothing ways
4507,_THE WIDOW._,And servile duties from her early days;
4508,_THE WIDOW._,One who had never from her childhood known
4509,_THE WIDOW._,"A wish fulfill’d, a purpose of her own."
4510,_THE WIDOW._,"Her part it was to sit beside the dame,"
4511,_THE WIDOW._,And give relief in every want that came;
4512,_THE WIDOW._,"To soothe the pride, to watch the varying look,"
4513,_THE WIDOW._,And bow in silence to the dumb rebuke.
4514,_THE WIDOW._,This supple being strove with all her skill      120
4515,_THE WIDOW._,To draw her master’s to her lady’s will;
4516,_THE WIDOW._,"For they were like the magnet and the steel,"
4517,_THE WIDOW._,At times so distant that they could not feel.
4518,_THE WIDOW._,"Then would she gently move them, till she saw"
4519,_THE WIDOW._,That to each other they began to draw;
4520,_THE WIDOW._,"And then would leave them, sure on her return"
4521,_THE WIDOW._,In Harriet’s joy her conquest to discern.
4522,_THE WIDOW._,"She was a mother now, and grieved to find"
4523,_THE WIDOW._,The nursery window caught the eastern wind;
4524,_THE WIDOW._,"What could she do, with fears like these oppress’d?      130"
4525,_THE WIDOW._,She built a room all window’d to the west;
4526,_THE WIDOW._,"For sure in one so dull, so bleak, so old,"
4527,_THE WIDOW._,She and her children must expire with cold.
4528,_THE WIDOW._,Meantime the husband murmur’d—“So he might;
4529,_THE WIDOW._,She would be judged by Cousins—Was it right?”
4530,_THE WIDOW._,"Water was near them, and her mind afloat;"
4531,_THE WIDOW._,"The lady saw a cottage and a boat,"
4532,_THE WIDOW._,And thought what sweet excursions they might make;      }
4533,_THE WIDOW._,How they might sail; what neighbours they might take;      }
4534,_THE WIDOW._,And nicely would she deck the lodge upon the lake.      140}
4535,_THE WIDOW._,"She now prevail’d by habit; had her will,"
4536,_THE WIDOW._,And found her patient husband sad and still.
4537,_THE WIDOW._,"Yet this displeased; she gain’d, indeed, the prize,"
4538,_THE WIDOW._,But not the pleasure of her victories;
4539,_THE WIDOW._,Was she a child to be indulged? He knew
4540,_THE WIDOW._,"She would have right, but would have reason too."
4541,_THE WIDOW._,"Now came the time, when in her husband’s face"
4542,_THE WIDOW._,"Care, and concern, and caution she could trace;"
4543,_THE WIDOW._,His troubled features gloom and sadness bore;
4544,_THE WIDOW._,"Less he resisted, but he suffer’d more;      150"
4545,_THE WIDOW._,His nerves were shook like hers; in him her grief
4546,_THE WIDOW._,"Had much of sympathy, but no relief."
4547,_THE WIDOW._,"She could no longer read, and therefore kept"
4548,_THE WIDOW._,A girl to give her stories while she wept;
4549,_THE WIDOW._,"Better for Lady Julia’s woes to cry,"
4550,_THE WIDOW._,Than have her own for ever in her eye.
4551,_THE WIDOW._,Her husband grieved; and o’er his spirits came
4552,_THE WIDOW._,"Gloom, and disease attack’d his slender frame;"
4553,_THE WIDOW._,He felt a loathing for the wretched state
4554,_THE WIDOW._,"Of his concerns, so sad, so complicate;      160"
4555,_THE WIDOW._,"Grief and confusion seized him in the day,"
4556,_THE WIDOW._,And the night pass’d in agony away.
4557,_THE WIDOW._,"“My ruin comes!” was his awakening thought,"
4558,_THE WIDOW._,And vainly through the day was comfort sought;
4559,_THE WIDOW._,"“There, take my all!” he said, and in his dream"
4560,_THE WIDOW._,"Heard the door bolted, and his children scream."
4561,_THE WIDOW._,"And he was right, for not a day arose"
4562,_THE WIDOW._,"That he exclaim’d not, “Will it never close?”"
4563,_THE WIDOW._,"“Would it were come!”—but still he shifted on,"
4564,_THE WIDOW._,"Till health, and hope, and life’s fair views were gone.      170"
4565,_THE WIDOW._,"Fretful herself, he of his wife in vain"
4566,_THE WIDOW._,For comfort sought—“He would be well again;
4567,_THE WIDOW._,Time would disorders of such nature heal!
4568,_THE WIDOW._,"O! if he felt what she was doom’d to feel,"
4569,_THE WIDOW._,Such sleepless nights! such broken rest! her frame
4570,_THE WIDOW._,Rack’d with diseases that she could not name!
4571,_THE WIDOW._,With pangs like hers no other was oppress’d!”
4572,_THE WIDOW._,"Weeping, she said, and sigh’d herself to rest."
4573,_THE WIDOW._,"The suffering husband look’d the world around,"
4574,_THE WIDOW._,And saw no friend: on him misfortune frown’d;      180
4575,_THE WIDOW._,Him self-reproach tormented; sorely tried
4576,_THE WIDOW._,"By threats, he mourn’d, and by disease, he died."
4577,_THE WIDOW._,"As weak as wailing infancy or age,"
4578,_THE WIDOW._,How could the widow with the world engage?
4579,_THE WIDOW._,"Fortune not now the means of comfort gave,"
4580,_THE WIDOW._,Yet all her comforts Harriet wept to have.
4581,_THE WIDOW._,"“My helpless babes,” she said, “will nothing know,”"
4582,_THE WIDOW._,Yet not a single lesson would bestow;
4583,_THE WIDOW._,"Her debts would overwhelm her, that was sure,"
4584,_THE WIDOW._,But one privation would she not endure.      190
4585,_THE WIDOW._,“We shall want bread! the thing is past a doubt.”—
4586,_THE WIDOW._,“Then part with Cousins!”—“Can I do without?”—
4587,_THE WIDOW._,"“Dismiss your servants!”—“Spare me them, I pray!”-"
4588,_THE WIDOW._,“At least your carriage!”—“What will people say?”—
4589,_THE WIDOW._,"“That useless boat, that folly on the lake!”—"
4590,_THE WIDOW._,“O! but what cry and scandal will it make!”
4591,_THE WIDOW._,"It was so hard on her, who not a thing"
4592,_THE WIDOW._,Had done such mischief on their heads to bring;
4593,_THE WIDOW._,"This was her comfort, this she would declare;"
4594,_THE WIDOW._,And then slept soundly on her pillow’d chair.      200
4595,_THE WIDOW._,"When not asleep, how restless was the soul"
4596,_THE WIDOW._,"Above advice, exempted from control;"
4597,_THE WIDOW._,"For ever begging all to be sincere,"
4598,_THE WIDOW._,And never willing any truth to hear.
4599,_THE WIDOW._,A yellow paleness o’er her visage spread;
4600,_THE WIDOW._,Her fears augmented as her comforts fled;
4601,_THE WIDOW._,Views dark and dismal to her mind appear’d;
4602,_THE WIDOW._,"And death she sometimes woo’d, and always fear’d."
4603,_THE WIDOW._,"Among the clerks there was a thoughtful one,"
4604,_THE WIDOW._,Who still believed that something might be done;      210
4605,_THE WIDOW._,"All in his view was not so sunk and lost,"
4606,_THE WIDOW._,But of a trial things would pay the cost.
4607,_THE WIDOW._,"He judged the widow, and he saw the way"
4608,_THE WIDOW._,In which her husband suffer’d her to stray;
4609,_THE WIDOW._,"He saw entangled and perplex’d affairs,"
4610,_THE WIDOW._,And Time’s sure hand at work on their repairs;
4611,_THE WIDOW._,"Children he saw; but nothing could he see,"
4612,_THE WIDOW._,Why he might not their careful father be;
4613,_THE WIDOW._,"And, looking keenly round him, he believed"
4614,_THE WIDOW._,That what was lost might quickly be retrieved.      220
4615,_THE WIDOW._,Now thought our clerk—“I must not mention love:
4616,_THE WIDOW._,That she at least must seem to disapprove;
4617,_THE WIDOW._,"But I must fear of poverty enforce,"
4618,_THE WIDOW._,And then consent will be a thing of course.”
4619,_THE WIDOW._,"“Madam!” said he, “with sorrow I relate,"
4620,_THE WIDOW._,That our affairs are in a dreadful state;
4621,_THE WIDOW._,"I call’d on all our friends, and they declared"
4622,_THE WIDOW._,They dared not meddle—not a creature dared;
4623,_THE WIDOW._,"But still our perseverance chance may aid,"
4624,_THE WIDOW._,"And, though I’m puzzled, I am not afraid;      230"
4625,_THE WIDOW._,"If you, dear lady, will attention give"
4626,_THE WIDOW._,"To me, the credit of the house shall live;"
4627,_THE WIDOW._,"Do not, I pray you, my proposal blame;"
4628,_THE WIDOW._,"It is my wish to guard your husband’s fame,"
4629,_THE WIDOW._,"And ease your trouble: then, your cares resign"
4630,_THE WIDOW._,"To my discretion—and, in short, be mine.”—"
4631,_THE WIDOW._,"“Yours! O! my stars!—Your goodness, sir, deserves"
4632,_THE WIDOW._,My grateful thanks—take pity on my nerves;
4633,_THE WIDOW._,"I shake and tremble at a thing so new,"
4634,_THE WIDOW._,And fear ’tis what a lady should not do;      240
4635,_THE WIDOW._,And then to marry upon ruin’s brink
4636,_THE WIDOW._,In all this hurry—What will people think?”—
4637,_THE WIDOW._,"“Nay, there’s against us neither rule nor law,"
4638,_THE WIDOW._,And people’s thinking is not worth a straw.
4639,_THE WIDOW._,Those who are prudent have too much to do
4640,_THE WIDOW._,With their own cares to think of me and you;
4641,_THE WIDOW._,"And those who are not are so poor a race,"
4642,_THE WIDOW._,That what they utter can be no disgrace.—
4643,_THE WIDOW._,Come! let us now embark; when time and tide
4644,_THE WIDOW._,"Invite to sea, in happy hour decide;      250"
4645,_THE WIDOW._,"If yet we linger, both are sure to fail,"
4646,_THE WIDOW._,The turning waters and the varying gale.
4647,_THE WIDOW._,"Trust me, our vessel shall be ably steer’d;"
4648,_THE WIDOW._,"Nor will I quit her, till the rocks are clear’d.”"
4649,_THE WIDOW._,"Allured and frighten’d, soften’d and afraid,"
4650,_THE WIDOW._,"The widow doubted, ponder’d, and obey’d."
4651,_THE WIDOW._,"So were they wedded, and the careful man"
4652,_THE WIDOW._,His reformation instantly began;
4653,_THE WIDOW._,"Began his state with vigour to reform,"
4654,_THE WIDOW._,And made a calm by laughing at the storm.      260
4655,_THE WIDOW._,Th’ attendant-maiden he dismiss’d—for why?
4656,_THE WIDOW._,She might on him and love like his rely;
4657,_THE WIDOW._,She needed none to form her children’s mind—
4658,_THE WIDOW._,That duty nature to her care assign’d.
4659,_THE WIDOW._,"In vain she mourn’d, it was her health he prized,"
4660,_THE WIDOW._,And hence enforced the measures he advised;
4661,_THE WIDOW._,"She wanted air; and walking, she was told,"
4662,_THE WIDOW._,"Was safe, was pleasant!—he the carriage sold;"
4663,_THE WIDOW._,He found a tenant who agreed to take
4664,_THE WIDOW._,The boat and cottage on the useless lake;      270
4665,_THE WIDOW._,"The house itself had now superfluous room,"
4666,_THE WIDOW._,And a rich lodger was induced to come.
4667,_THE WIDOW._,"The lady wonder’d at the sudden change,"
4668,_THE WIDOW._,"That yet was pleasant, that was very strange."
4669,_THE WIDOW._,When every deed by her desire was done.
4670,_THE WIDOW._,"She had no day of comfort—no, not one;"
4671,_THE WIDOW._,"When nothing moved or stopp’d at her request,"
4672,_THE WIDOW._,"Her heart had comfort, and her temper rest;"
4673,_THE WIDOW._,For all was done with kindness—most polite
4674,_THE WIDOW._,"Was her new lord, and she confess’d it right;      280"
4675,_THE WIDOW._,For now she found that she could gaily live
4676,_THE WIDOW._,On what the chance of common life could give:
4677,_THE WIDOW._,"And her sick mind was cured of every ill,"
4678,_THE WIDOW._,By finding no compliance with her will;
4679,_THE WIDOW._,"For, when she saw that her desires were vain,"
4680,_THE WIDOW._,She wisely thought it foolish to complain.
4681,_THE WIDOW._,"Born for her man, she gave a gentle sigh"
4682,_THE WIDOW._,"To her lost power, and grieved not to comply;"
4683,_THE WIDOW._,"Within, without, the face of things improved,"
4684,_THE WIDOW._,And all in order and subjection moved.      290
4685,_THE WIDOW._,"As wealth increased, ambition now began"
4686,_THE WIDOW._,To swell the soul of the aspiring man.
4687,_THE WIDOW._,"In some few years he thought to purchase land,"
4688,_THE WIDOW._,And build a seat that Hope and Fancy plann’d;
4689,_THE WIDOW._,To this a name his youthful bride should give!
4690,_THE WIDOW._,"Harriet, of course, not many years would live;"
4691,_THE WIDOW._,"Then he would farm, and every soil should show"
4692,_THE WIDOW._,The tree that best upon the place would grow:
4693,_THE WIDOW._,"He would, moreover, on the Bench debate"
4694,_THE WIDOW._,On sundry questions—when a magistrate;      300
4695,_THE WIDOW._,"Would talk of all that to the state belongs,"
4696,_THE WIDOW._,"The rich man’s duties, and the poor man’s wrongs;"
4697,_THE WIDOW._,"He would with favourites of the people rank,"
4698,_THE WIDOW._,And him the weak and the oppress’d should thank.
4699,_THE WIDOW._,"’Tis true those children, orphans then! would need"
4700,_THE WIDOW._,"Help, in a world of trouble to succeed!"
4701,_THE WIDOW._,And they should have it—He should then possess
4702,_THE WIDOW._,All that man needs for earthly happiness.
4703,_THE WIDOW._,"“Proud words, and vain!” said Doctor Young; and proud"
4704,_THE WIDOW._,They are; and vain were by our clerk allow’d;      310
4705,_THE WIDOW._,"For, while he dream’d, there came both pain and cough,"
4706,_THE WIDOW._,"And fever never tamed, and bore him off;"
4707,_THE WIDOW._,"Young as he was, and planning schemes to live"
4708,_THE WIDOW._,With more delight than man’s success can give;
4709,_THE WIDOW._,"Building a mansion in his fancy vast,"
4710,_THE WIDOW._,Beyond the Gothic pride of ages past!
4711,_THE WIDOW._,"While this was plann’d, but ere a place was sought,"
4712,_THE WIDOW._,"The timber season’d, or the quarry wrought,"
4713,_THE WIDOW._,Came Death’s dread summons; and the man was laid
4714,_THE WIDOW._,In the poor house the simple sexton made.      320
4715,_THE WIDOW._,"But he had time for thought when he was ill,"
4716,_THE WIDOW._,And made his lady an indulgent will:
4717,_THE WIDOW._,"’Tis said he gave, in parting, his advice,"
4718,_THE WIDOW._,“It is sufficient to be married twice;”
4719,_THE WIDOW._,"To which she answer’d, as ’tis said, again,"
4720,_THE WIDOW._,"“There’s none will have you, if you’re poor and plain;"
4721,_THE WIDOW._,"And, if you’re rich and handsome, there is none"
4722,_THE WIDOW._,Will take refusal—let the point alone.”
4723,_THE WIDOW._,"Be this or true or false, it is her praise"
4724,_THE WIDOW._,She mourn’d correctly all the mourning days;      330
4725,_THE WIDOW._,"But grieve she did not, for the canker grief"
4726,_THE WIDOW._,"Soils the complexion, and is beauty’s thief."
4727,_THE WIDOW._,"Nothing, indeed, so much will discompose"
4728,_THE WIDOW._,Our public mourning as our private woes;
4729,_THE WIDOW._,"When tender thoughts a widow’s bosom probe,"
4730,_THE WIDOW._,She thinks not then how graceful sits the robe;
4731,_THE WIDOW._,"But our nice widow look’d to every fold,"
4732,_THE WIDOW._,And every eye its beauty might behold!
4733,_THE WIDOW._,"It was becoming; she composed her face,"
4734,_THE WIDOW._,"She look’d serenely, and she mourn’d with grace.      340"
4735,_THE WIDOW._,Some months were pass’d; but yet there wanted three
4736,_THE WIDOW._,Of the full time when widows wives may be—
4737,_THE WIDOW._,"One trying year, and then the mind is freed,"
4738,_THE WIDOW._,And man may to the vacant throne succeed.
4739,_THE WIDOW._,"There was a tenant—he, to wit, who hired"
4740,_THE WIDOW._,"That cot and lake, that were so much admired;"
4741,_THE WIDOW._,"A man of spirit, one who doubtless meant,"
4742,_THE WIDOW._,"Though he delay’d awhile, to pay his rent;"
4743,_THE WIDOW._,"The widow’s riches gave her much delight,"
4744,_THE WIDOW._,And some her claims; and she resolved to write.      350
4745,_THE WIDOW._,"“He knew her grievous loss, how every care"
4746,_THE WIDOW._,"Devolved on her, who had indeed her share;"
4747,_THE WIDOW._,She had no doubt of him—but was as sure
4748,_THE WIDOW._,As that she breathed her money was secure;
4749,_THE WIDOW._,But she had made a rash and idle vow
4750,_THE WIDOW._,"To claim her dues, and she must keep it now."
4751,_THE WIDOW._,"So, if it suited——”"
4752,_THE WIDOW._,And for this there came
4753,_THE WIDOW._,A civil answer to the gentle dame.
4754,_THE WIDOW._,"Within the letter were excuses, thanks,"
4755,_THE WIDOW._,And clean Bank paper from the best of banks;      360
4756,_THE WIDOW._,"There were condolence, consolation, praise,"
4757,_THE WIDOW._,With some slight hints of danger in delays.
4758,_THE WIDOW._,With these good things were others from the lake:      }
4759,_THE WIDOW._,"Perch that were wish’d to salmon for her sake,      }"
4760,_THE WIDOW._,And compliment as sweet as new-born hope could make.      }
4761,_THE WIDOW._,"This led to friendly visits, social calls,"
4762,_THE WIDOW._,"And much discourse of races, rambles, balls;"
4763,_THE WIDOW._,"But all in proper bounds, and not a word"
4764,_THE WIDOW._,"Before its time—the man was not absurd,"
4765,_THE WIDOW._,"Nor was he cold; but, when she might expect,      370"
4766,_THE WIDOW._,"A letter came, and one to this effect:"
4767,_THE WIDOW._,"“That, if his eyes had not his love convey’d,"
4768,_THE WIDOW._,They had their master shamefully betray’d;
4769,_THE WIDOW._,"But she must know the flame, that he was sure,"
4770,_THE WIDOW._,"Nor she could doubt, would long as life endure."
4771,_THE WIDOW._,"Both were in widow’d state, and both possess’d"
4772,_THE WIDOW._,Of ample means to make their union bless’d;
4773,_THE WIDOW._,"That she had been confined he knew for truth,"
4774,_THE WIDOW._,And begg’d her to have pity on her youth;
4775,_THE WIDOW._,"Youth, he would say, and he desired his wife      380"
4776,_THE WIDOW._,To have the comforts of an easy life.
4777,_THE WIDOW._,"She loved a carriage, loved a decent seat"
4778,_THE WIDOW._,To which they might at certain times retreat;
4779,_THE WIDOW._,Servants indeed were sorrows—yet a few
4780,_THE WIDOW._,"They still must add, and do as others do;"
4781,_THE WIDOW._,"She too would some attendant damsel need,"
4782,_THE WIDOW._,"To hear, to speak, to travel, or to read.”"
4783,_THE WIDOW._,"In short, the man his remedies assign’d"
4784,_THE WIDOW._,For his foreknown diseases in the mind:—
4785,_THE WIDOW._,"“First,” he presumed, “that in a nervous case      390"
4786,_THE WIDOW._,Nothing was better than a change of place;”
4787,_THE WIDOW._,"He added, too, “’Twas well that he could prove"
4788,_THE WIDOW._,"That his was pure, disinterested love;"
4789,_THE WIDOW._,Not as when lawyers couple house and land
4790,_THE WIDOW._,In such a way as none can understand:
4791,_THE WIDOW._,"No! thanks to Him that every good supplied,"
4792,_THE WIDOW._,"He had enough, and wanted nought beside!"
4793,_THE WIDOW._,Merit was all.”
4794,_THE WIDOW._,"“Well! now, she would protest,"
4795,_THE WIDOW._,This was a letter prettily express’d.”
4796,_THE WIDOW._,To every female friend away she flew      400
4797,_THE WIDOW._,"To ask advice, and say, “What shall I do?”"
4798,_THE WIDOW._,"She kiss’d her children—and she said, with tears,"
4799,_THE WIDOW._,"“I wonder what is best for you, my dears?"
4800,_THE WIDOW._,"How can I, darlings, to your good attend      }"
4801,_THE WIDOW._,"Without the help of some experienced friend,      }"
4802,_THE WIDOW._,"Who will protect us all, or, injured, will defend?”      }"
4803,_THE WIDOW._,The widow then ask’d counsel of her heart—
4804,_THE WIDOW._,"In vain, for that had nothing to impart;"
4805,_THE WIDOW._,"But yet with that, or something, for her guide,"
4806,_THE WIDOW._,She to her swain thus guardedly replied:      410
4807,_THE WIDOW._,"“She must believe he was sincere, for why"
4808,_THE WIDOW._,Should one who needed nothing deign to lie?
4809,_THE WIDOW._,"But though she could and did his truth admit,"
4810,_THE WIDOW._,She could not praise him for his taste a bit;
4811,_THE WIDOW._,"And yet men’s tastes were various, she confess’d,"
4812,_THE WIDOW._,And none could prove his own to be the best;
4813,_THE WIDOW._,"It was a vast concern, including all"
4814,_THE WIDOW._,That we can happiness or comfort call;
4815,_THE WIDOW._,And yet she found that those who waited long
4816,_THE WIDOW._,"Before their choice, had often chosen wrong.      420"
4817,_THE WIDOW._,"Nothing, indeed, could for her loss atone,"
4818,_THE WIDOW._,But ’twas the greater that she lived alone;
4819,_THE WIDOW._,"She, too, had means, and therefore what the use"
4820,_THE WIDOW._,"Of more, that still more trouble would produce?"
4821,_THE WIDOW._,"And pleasure too she own’d, as well as care,"
4822,_THE WIDOW._,"Of which, at present, she had not her share."
4823,_THE WIDOW._,"“The things he offer’d, she must needs confess,"
4824,_THE WIDOW._,"They were all women’s wishes, more or less;"
4825,_THE WIDOW._,But were expensive—though a man of sense
4826,_THE WIDOW._,Would by his prudence lighten the expense.      430
4827,_THE WIDOW._,"Prudent he was, but made a sad mistake"
4828,_THE WIDOW._,When he proposed her faded face to take;
4829,_THE WIDOW._,And yet ’tis said there’s beauty that will last
4830,_THE WIDOW._,When the rose withers and the bloom be past.
4831,_THE WIDOW._,“One thing displeased her—that he could suppose
4832,_THE WIDOW._,He might so soon his purposes disclose;
4833,_THE WIDOW._,"Yet had she hints of such intent before,"
4834,_THE WIDOW._,And would excuse him if he wrote no more.
4835,_THE WIDOW._,What would the world—and yet she judged them fools
4836,_THE WIDOW._,Who let the world’s suggestions be their rules;      440
4837,_THE WIDOW._,What would her friends—Yet in her own affairs
4838,_THE WIDOW._,"It was her business to decide, not theirs.—"
4839,_THE WIDOW._,"Adieu! then, sir,” she added; “thus you find      }"
4840,_THE WIDOW._,"The changeless purpose of a steady mind,      }"
4841,_THE WIDOW._,"In one now left alone, but to her fate resign’d.”      }"
4842,_THE WIDOW._,The marriage follow’d; and th’ experienced dame
4843,_THE WIDOW._,Consider’d what the conduct that became
4844,_THE WIDOW._,A thrice-devoted lady—She confess’d
4845,_THE WIDOW._,That when indulged she was but more distress’d;
4846,_THE WIDOW._,"And, by her second husband when controll’d,      450"
4847,_THE WIDOW._,"Her life was pleasant, though her love was cold;"
4848,_THE WIDOW._,"“Then let me yield,” she said, and with a sigh,"
4849,_THE WIDOW._,"“Let me to wrong submit, with right comply.”"
4850,_THE WIDOW._,"Alas! obedience may mistake, and they"
4851,_THE WIDOW._,Who reason not will err when they obey;
4852,_THE WIDOW._,And fated was the gentle dame to find
4853,_THE WIDOW._,"Her duty wrong, and her obedience blind."
4854,_THE WIDOW._,"The man was kind, but would have no dispute,"
4855,_THE WIDOW._,His love and kindness both were absolute.
4856,_THE WIDOW._,She needed not her wishes to express      460
4857,_THE WIDOW._,To one who urged her on to happiness;
4858,_THE WIDOW._,"For this he took her to the lakes and seas,      }"
4859,_THE WIDOW._,"To mines and mountains, nor allow’d her ease;      }"
4860,_THE WIDOW._,"She must be pleased, he said, and he must live to please.      }"
4861,_THE WIDOW._,"He hurried north and south, and east and west,"
4862,_THE WIDOW._,When age required they would have time to rest;
4863,_THE WIDOW._,"He in the richest dress her form array’d,"
4864,_THE WIDOW._,"And cared not what he promised, what he paid;"
4865,_THE WIDOW._,"She should share all his pleasures as her own,"
4866,_THE WIDOW._,And see whatever could be sought or shown.      470
4867,_THE WIDOW._,"This run of pleasure for a time she bore,"
4868,_THE WIDOW._,And then affirm’d that she could taste no more;
4869,_THE WIDOW._,"She loved it while its nature it retain’d,"
4870,_THE WIDOW._,"But, made a duty, it displeased and pain’d."
4871,_THE WIDOW._,“Have we not means?” the joyous husband cried;
4872,_THE WIDOW._,"“But I am wearied out,” the wife replied."
4873,_THE WIDOW._,“Wearied with pleasure! Thing till now unheard—
4874,_THE WIDOW._,Are all that sweeten trouble to be fear’d?
4875,_THE WIDOW._,"’Tis but the sameness tires you—cross the seas,"
4876,_THE WIDOW._,And let us taste the world’s varieties.      480
4877,_THE WIDOW._,"“’Tis said, in Paris that a man may live"
4878,_THE WIDOW._,In all the luxuries a world can give;
4879,_THE WIDOW._,And in a space confined to narrow bound
4880,_THE WIDOW._,All the enjoyments of our life are found.
4881,_THE WIDOW._,"There we may eat and drink, may dance and dress,"
4882,_THE WIDOW._,And in its very essence joy possess;
4883,_THE WIDOW._,May see a moving crowd of lovely dames;
4884,_THE WIDOW._,May win a fortune at your favourite games;
4885,_THE WIDOW._,"May hear the sounds that ravish human sense,"
4886,_THE WIDOW._,And all without receding foot from thence.”      490
4887,_THE WIDOW._,"The conquer’d wife, resistless and afraid,"
4888,_THE WIDOW._,To the strong call a sad obedience paid.
4889,_THE WIDOW._,"As we an infant in its pain with sweets,"
4890,_THE WIDOW._,"Loved once, now loath’d, torment him till he eats,"
4891,_THE WIDOW._,Who on the authors of his new distress
4892,_THE WIDOW._,Looks trembling with disgusted weariness:
4893,_THE WIDOW._,"So Harriet felt, so look’d, and seem’d to say,"
4894,_THE WIDOW._,"“O! for a day of rest, an holiday!”"
4895,_THE WIDOW._,"At length, her courage rising with her fear,"
4896,_THE WIDOW._,"She said, “Our pleasures may be bought too dear!”      500"
4897,_THE WIDOW._,To this he answer’d—“Dearest! from thy heart
4898,_THE WIDOW._,Bid every fear of evil times depart;
4899,_THE WIDOW._,I ever trusted in the trying hour
4900,_THE WIDOW._,"To my good stars, and felt the ruling power;"
4901,_THE WIDOW._,"When want drew nigh, his threat’ning speed was stopp’d,"
4902,_THE WIDOW._,"Some virgin aunt, some childless uncle dropped;"
4903,_THE WIDOW._,"In all his threats I sought expedients new,"
4904,_THE WIDOW._,"And my last, best resource was found in you.”"
4905,_THE WIDOW._,"Silent and sad the wife beheld her doom,"
4906,_THE WIDOW._,"And sat her down to see the ruin come,      510"
4907,_THE WIDOW._,And meet the ills that rise where money fails—
4908,_THE WIDOW._,"Debts, threats and duns, bills, bailiffs, writs and jails."
4909,_THE WIDOW._,"These was she spared; ere yet by want oppress’d,"
4910,_THE WIDOW._,Came one more fierce than bailiff in arrest:
4911,_THE WIDOW._,"Amid a scene where Pleasure never came,"
4912,_THE WIDOW._,"Though never ceased the mention of his name,"
4913,_THE WIDOW._,The husband’s heated blood received the breath
4914,_THE WIDOW._,"Of strong disease, that bore him to his death."
4915,_THE WIDOW._,"Her all collected,—whether great or small"
4916,_THE WIDOW._,"The sum, I know not, but collected all—      520"
4917,_THE WIDOW._,"The widow’d lady to her cot retired,"
4918,_THE WIDOW._,And there she lives delighted and admired.
4919,_THE WIDOW._,"Civil to all, compliant and polite,      }"
4920,_THE WIDOW._,"Disposed to think, “whatever is, is right,”      }"
4921,_THE WIDOW._,"She wears the widow’s weeds, she gives the widow’s mite.      }"
4922,_THE WIDOW._,"At home awhile, she in the autumn finds"
4923,_THE WIDOW._,"The sea an object for reflecting minds,"
4924,_THE WIDOW._,"And change for tender spirits; there she reads,"
4925,_THE WIDOW._,And weeps in comfort in her graceful weeds.
4926,_THE WIDOW._,What gives our tale its moral? Here we find      530
4927,_THE WIDOW._,That wives like this are not for rule design’d
4928,_THE WIDOW._,"Nor yet for blind submission: happy they,"
4929,_THE WIDOW._,"Who while they feel it pleasant to obey,"
4930,_THE WIDOW._,Have yet a kind companion at their side      }
4931,_THE WIDOW._,"Who in their journey will his power divide,      }"
4932,_THE WIDOW._,"Or yield the reins, and bid the lady guide;      }"
4933,_THE WIDOW._,"Then points the wonders of the way, and makes"
4934,_THE WIDOW._,The duty pleasant that she undertakes;
4935,_THE WIDOW._,"He shows her objects as they move along,"
4936,_THE WIDOW._,And gently rules the movements that are wrong:      540
4937,_THE WIDOW._,"He tells her all the skilful driver’s art,"
4938,_THE WIDOW._,And smiles to see how well she acts her part;
4939,_THE WIDOW._,"Nor praise denies to courage or to skill,"
4940,_THE WIDOW._,In using power that he resumes at will.

4961,_ELLEN._,
4962,_ELLEN._,"Bleak was the morn—Said Richard, with a sigh,      }"
4963,_ELLEN._,"“I must depart!”—“That, Brother, I deny,”      }"
4964,_ELLEN._,Said George—“You may; but I perceive not why.”      }
4965,_ELLEN._,"This point before had been discuss’d, but still"
4966,_ELLEN._,The guest submitted to the ruling will;
4967,_ELLEN._,But every day gave rise to doubt and fear—
4968,_ELLEN._,"He heard not now, as he was wont to hear,"
4969,_ELLEN._,"That all was well!—though little was cxpress’d,"
4970,_ELLEN._,It seem’d to him the writer was distress’d;
4971,_ELLEN._,"Restrain’d! there was attempt and strife to please,      10"
4972,_ELLEN._,Pains and endeavour—not Matilda’s ease—
4973,_ELLEN._,Not the pure lines of love! the guileless friend
4974,_ELLEN._,In all her freedom—What could this portend?
4975,_ELLEN._,"“Fancy!” said George, “the self-tormentor’s pain”;—"
4976,_ELLEN._,And Richard still consented to remain.
4977,_ELLEN._,“Ride you this fair cool morning?” said the squire:      }
4978,_ELLEN._,"Do—for a purchase I have made inquire,      }"
4979,_ELLEN._,And with you take a will complacently t’admire:      }
4980,_ELLEN._,"Southward at first, dear Richard, make your way;"
4981,_ELLEN._,Cross Hilton Bridge; move on through Breken Clay;      20
4982,_ELLEN._,"At Dunham Wood turn duly to the east,"
4983,_ELLEN._,And there your eyes upon the ocean feast;
4984,_ELLEN._,"Then ride above the cliff, or ride below,"
4985,_ELLEN._,"You’ll be enraptured, for your taste I know:"
4986,_ELLEN._,"It is a prospect that a man might stay,"
4987,_ELLEN._,To his bride hastening on his wedding-day.
4988,_ELLEN._,"At Tilburn Sluice once more ascend, and view      }"
4989,_ELLEN._,"A decent house; an ample garden too,      }"
4990,_ELLEN._,"And planted well behind—a lively scene, and new:      }"
4991,_ELLEN._,"A little taste, a little pomp, display’d      30"
4992,_ELLEN._,"By a dull man, who had retired from trade"
4993,_ELLEN._,To enjoy his leisure—Here he came prepared
4994,_ELLEN._,"To farm, nor cost in preparation spared;"
4995,_ELLEN._,"But many works he purchased, some he read,      }"
4996,_ELLEN._,"And often rose with projects in his head,      }"
4997,_ELLEN._,"Of crops in courses raised, of herds by matching bred.      }"
4998,_ELLEN._,We had just found these little humours out;
4999,_ELLEN._,Just saw—he saw not—what he was about;
5000,_ELLEN._,"Just met as neighbours, still disposed to meet;"
5001,_ELLEN._,Just learn’d the current tales of Dowling Street;      40
5002,_ELLEN._,"And were just thinking of our female friends,"
5003,_ELLEN._,"Saying—‘You know not what the man intends,"
5004,_ELLEN._,"A rich, kind, hearty’—and it might be true"
5005,_ELLEN._,"Something he wish’d, but had not time to do—"
5006,_ELLEN._,A cold ere yet the falling leaf! of small
5007,_ELLEN._,"Effect till then, was fatal in the fall;"
5008,_ELLEN._,And of that house was his possession brief—
5009,_ELLEN._,Go; and guard well against the falling leaf.
5010,_ELLEN._,"“But hear me, Richard: looking to my ease,"
5011,_ELLEN._,Try if you can find something that will please.      50
5012,_ELLEN._,"Faults if you see, and such as must abide,"
5013,_ELLEN._,"Say they are small, or say that I can hide;"
5014,_ELLEN._,"But faults that I can change, remove, or mend,"
5015,_ELLEN._,These like a foe detect—or like a friend.
5016,_ELLEN._,"“Mark well the rooms, and their proportions learn;"
5017,_ELLEN._,"In each some use, some elegance discern;"
5018,_ELLEN._,"Observe the garden, its productive wall,"
5019,_ELLEN._,And find a something to commend in all.
5020,_ELLEN._,"Then, should you praise them in a knowing way,"
5021,_ELLEN._,I’ll take it kindly—that is well—be gay.      60
5022,_ELLEN._,“Nor pass the pebbled cottage as you rise
5023,_ELLEN._,"Above the sluice, till you have fix’d your eyes"
5024,_ELLEN._,"On the low woodbined window, and have seen,"
5025,_ELLEN._,"So fortune favour you, the ghost within."
5026,_ELLEN._,"Take but one look, and then your way pursue:"
5027,_ELLEN._,"It flies all strangers, and it knows not you.”"
5028,_ELLEN._,"Richard return’d, and by his Brother stood,"
5029,_ELLEN._,"Not in a pensive, not in pleasant mood;"
5030,_ELLEN._,"But by strong feeling into stillness wrought,"
5031,_ELLEN._,"As nothing thinking, or with too much thought;      70"
5032,_ELLEN._,"Or like a man who means indeed to speak,"
5033,_ELLEN._,But would his hearer should his purpose seek.
5034,_ELLEN._,"When George—“What is it, Brother, you would hide?      }"
5035,_ELLEN._,"Or what confess?”—“Who is she?” he replied,      }"
5036,_ELLEN._,"That angel whom I saw, to whom is she allied?      }"
5037,_ELLEN._,"Of this fair being let me understand,"
5038,_ELLEN._,"And I will praise your purchase, house and land."
5039,_ELLEN._,"“Hers was that cottage on the rising ground,"
5040,_ELLEN._,"West of the waves, and just beyond their sound;"
5041,_ELLEN._,"’Tis larger than the rest, and whence, indeed,      80"
5042,_ELLEN._,You might expect a lady to proceed;
5043,_ELLEN._,"But O! this creature, far as I could trace,"
5044,_ELLEN._,Will soon be carried to another place.
5045,_ELLEN._,"“‘Fair, fragile thing!’ I said, when first my eye"
5046,_ELLEN._,"Caught hers, ‘wilt thou expand thy wings and fly?"
5047,_ELLEN._,"Or wilt thou vanish? beauteous spirit, stay!—"
5048,_ELLEN._,For will it not’ (I question’d) ‘melt away?’
5049,_ELLEN._,"No! it was mortal—I unseen was near,"
5050,_ELLEN._,"And saw the bosom’s sigh, the standing tear!"
5051,_ELLEN._,"She thought profoundly, for I stay’d to look;      90"
5052,_ELLEN._,"And first she read, then laid aside her book;"
5053,_ELLEN._,"Then on her hand reclined her lovely head,"
5054,_ELLEN._,And seem’d unconscious of the tear she shed.
5055,_ELLEN._,"“‘Art thou so much,’ I said, ‘to grief a prey?’"
5056,_ELLEN._,"Till pity pain’d me, and I rode away."
5057,_ELLEN._,"“Tell me, my Brother, is that sorrow dread"
5058,_ELLEN._,For the great change that bears her to the dead?
5059,_ELLEN._,Has she connexions? does she love?—I feel
5060,_ELLEN._,Pity and grief; wilt thou her woes reveal?”—
5061,_ELLEN._,"They are not lasting, Richard; they are woes      100"
5062,_ELLEN._,Chastised and meek! she sings them to repose;
5063,_ELLEN._,"If not, she reasons; if they still remain,"
5064,_ELLEN._,"She finds resource, that none shall find in vain."
5065,_ELLEN._,"“Whether disease first grew upon regret,"
5066,_ELLEN._,"Or nature gave it, is uncertain yet,"
5067,_ELLEN._,"And must remain; the frame was slightly made,"
5068,_ELLEN._,"That grief assail’d, and all is now decay’d!"
5069,_ELLEN._,"“But though so willing from the world to part,"
5070,_ELLEN._,I must not call her case a broken heart;
5071,_ELLEN._,Nor dare I take upon me to maintain      110
5072,_ELLEN._,That hearts once broken never heal again.”
5073,_ELLEN._,
5074,_ELLEN._,*       *       *       *       *
5075,_ELLEN._,
5076,_ELLEN._,"She was an only daughter, one whose sire"
5077,_ELLEN._,Loved not that girls to knowledge should aspire;
5078,_ELLEN._,"But he had sons, and Ellen quickly caught"
5079,_ELLEN._,Whatever they were by their masters taught;
5080,_ELLEN._,This when the father saw—“It is the turn
5081,_ELLEN._,"Of her strange mind,” said he, “but let her learn;"
5082,_ELLEN._,’Tis almost pity with that shape and face—
5083,_ELLEN._,"But is a fashion, and brings no disgrace;"
5084,_ELLEN._,"Women of old wrote verse, or for the stage      120}"
5085,_ELLEN._,"Brought forth their works! they now are reasoners sage,      }"
5086,_ELLEN._,And with severe pursuits dare grapple and engage.      }
5087,_ELLEN._,"If such her mind, I shall in vain oppose;"
5088,_ELLEN._,"If not, her labours of themselves will close.”"
5089,_ELLEN._,"Ellen, ’twas found, had skill without pretence,"
5090,_ELLEN._,And silenced envy by her meek good sense;
5091,_ELLEN._,"That Ellen learnt, her various knowledge proved;"
5092,_ELLEN._,"Soft words and tender looks, that Ellen loved;"
5093,_ELLEN._,For he who taught her brothers found in her
5094,_ELLEN._,"A constant, ready, eager auditor;      130"
5095,_ELLEN._,"This he perceived, nor could his joy disguise:"
5096,_ELLEN._,"It tuned his voice, it sparkled in his eyes."
5097,_ELLEN._,"Not very young, nor very handsome he,"
5098,_ELLEN._,But very fit an Abelard to be;
5099,_ELLEN._,His manner and his meekness hush’d alarm
5100,_ELLEN._,In all but Ellen—Ellen felt the charm.
5101,_ELLEN._,Hers was fond “filial love”; she found delight
5102,_ELLEN._,To have her mind’s dear father in her sight;
5103,_ELLEN._,But soon the borrow’d notion she resign’d!
5104,_ELLEN._,He was no father—even to the mind.      140
5105,_ELLEN._,"But Ellen had her comforts—“He will speak,”"
5106,_ELLEN._,"She said, “for he beholds me fond and weak;"
5107,_ELLEN._,"Fond, and he therefore may securely plead—"
5108,_ELLEN._,"Weak, I have therefore of his firmness need;"
5109,_ELLEN._,"With whom my father will his Ellen trust,"
5110,_ELLEN._,Because he knows him to be kind and just.”
5111,_ELLEN._,Alas! too well the conscious lover knew
5112,_ELLEN._,"The parent’s mind, and well the daughter’s too;"
5113,_ELLEN._,"He felt of duty the imperious call,"
5114,_ELLEN._,"Beheld his danger, and must fly or fall.      150"
5115,_ELLEN._,"What would the parent, what his pupils think?"
5116,_ELLEN._,O! he was standing on perdition’s brink:
5117,_ELLEN._,"In his dilemma flight alone remain’d,"
5118,_ELLEN._,And could he fly whose very soul was chain’d?
5119,_ELLEN._,He knew she loved; she tried not to conceal
5120,_ELLEN._,A hope she thought that virtue’s self might feel.
5121,_ELLEN._,"Ever of her and her frank heart afraid,      }"
5122,_ELLEN._,"Doubting himself, he sought in absence aid,      }"
5123,_ELLEN._,"And had resolved on flight, but still the act delay’d;      }"
5124,_ELLEN._,"At last so high his apprehension rose,      160"
5125,_ELLEN._,That he would both his love and labour close.
5126,_ELLEN._,"“While undisclosed my fear each instant grows,"
5127,_ELLEN._,And I lament the guilt that no one knows:
5128,_ELLEN._,"Success undoes me, and the view, that cheers"
5129,_ELLEN._,"All other men, all dark to me appears!”"
5130,_ELLEN._,"Thus as he thought, his Ellen at his side"
5131,_ELLEN._,Her soothing softness to his grief applied;
5132,_ELLEN._,With like effect as water cast on flame:
5133,_ELLEN._,"For he more heated and confused became,"
5134,_ELLEN._,"And broke in sorrow from the wondering maid,      170}"
5135,_ELLEN._,Who was at once offended and afraid;      }
5136,_ELLEN._,"Yet “Do not go!” she cried, and was awhile obey’d.      }"
5137,_ELLEN._,"“Art thou then ill, dear friend?” she ask’d, and took"
5138,_ELLEN._,His passive hand—“How very pale thy look!
5139,_ELLEN._,"And thou art cold, and tremblest—pray thee tell"
5140,_ELLEN._,"Thy friend, thy Ellen, is her master well?"
5141,_ELLEN._,And let her with her loving care attend
5142,_ELLEN._,To all that vexes and disturbs her friend.”—
5143,_ELLEN._,"“Nay, my dear lady! we have all our cares,"
5144,_ELLEN._,And I am troubled with my poor affairs:      180
5145,_ELLEN._,"Thou canst not aid me, Ellen; could it be,"
5146,_ELLEN._,"And might it, doubtless I would fly to thee;"
5147,_ELLEN._,"But we have sundry duties, and must all,"
5148,_ELLEN._,"Hard as it may be, go where duties call—"
5149,_ELLEN._,"Suppose the trial were this instant thine,"
5150,_ELLEN._,Couldst thou the happiest of thy views resign
5151,_ELLEN._,"At duty’s strong command?”—“If thou wert by,”      }"
5152,_ELLEN._,"Said the unconscious maiden, “I would try!”—      }"
5153,_ELLEN._,And as she sigh’d she heard the soft responsive sigh.      }
5154,_ELLEN._,"And then, assuming steadiness, “Adieu!”      190"
5155,_ELLEN._,"He cried, and from the grieving Ellen flew;"
5156,_ELLEN._,And to her father with a bleeding heart
5157,_ELLEN._,"He went, his grief and purpose to impart;"
5158,_ELLEN._,"Told of his health, and did in part confess"
5159,_ELLEN._,That he should love the noble maiden less.
5160,_ELLEN._,The parent’s pride to sudden rage gave way—
5161,_ELLEN._,“And the girl loves! that plainly you would say—
5162,_ELLEN._,"And you with honour, in your pride, retire!—"
5163,_ELLEN._,"Sir, I your prudence envy and admire.”"
5164,_ELLEN._,"But here the father saw the rising frown,      200"
5165,_ELLEN._,And quickly let his lofty spirit down.
5166,_ELLEN._,“Forgive a parent!—I may well excuse
5167,_ELLEN._,A girl who could perceive such worth and choose
5168,_ELLEN._,To make it hers; we must not look to meet      }
5169,_ELLEN._,All we might wish;—Is age itself discreet?      }
5170,_ELLEN._,"Where conquest may not be, ’tis prudence to retreat.”      }"
5171,_ELLEN._,"Then, with the kindness worldly minds assume,"
5172,_ELLEN._,He praised the self-pronounced and rigorous doom;
5173,_ELLEN._,"He wonder’d not that one so young should love,"
5174,_ELLEN._,And much he wish’d he could the choice approve;      210
5175,_ELLEN._,"Much he lamented such a mind to lose,"
5176,_ELLEN._,"And begg’d to learn if he could aid his views,"
5177,_ELLEN._,"If such were form’d—then closed the short account,"
5178,_ELLEN._,And to a shilling paid the full amount.—
5179,_ELLEN._,"So Cecil left the mansion, and so flew      }"
5180,_ELLEN._,"To foreign shores, without an interview;      }"
5181,_ELLEN._,"He must not say, ‘I love’—he could not say, ‘Adieu!’      }"
5182,_ELLEN._,"Long was he absent—as a guide to youth,"
5183,_ELLEN._,"With grief contending, and in search of truth;"
5184,_ELLEN._,"In courting peace, and trying to forget      220"
5185,_ELLEN._,What was so deeply interesting yet.
5186,_ELLEN._,A friend in England gave him all the news—
5187,_ELLEN._,sad indulgence that he would not lose.
5188,_ELLEN._,He told how Ellen suffer’d; how they sent
5189,_ELLEN._,"The maid from home, in sullen discontent,"
5190,_ELLEN._,"With some relation on the Lakes to live,"
5191,_ELLEN._,In all the sorrow such retirements give;
5192,_ELLEN._,"And there she roved among the rocks, and took"
5193,_ELLEN._,"Moss from the stone, and pebbles from the brook;"
5194,_ELLEN._,"Gazed on the flies that settled on the flowers,      230"
5195,_ELLEN._,And so consumed her melancholy hours.
5196,_ELLEN._,Again he wrote—The father then was dead;
5197,_ELLEN._,"And Ellen to her native village fled,"
5198,_ELLEN._,"With native feeling—there she oped her door,"
5199,_ELLEN._,"Her heart, her purse, and comforted the poor,"
5200,_ELLEN._,"The sick, the sad—and there she pass’d her days,      }"
5201,_ELLEN._,"Deserving much, but never seeking praise:      }"
5202,_ELLEN._,"Her task to guide herself, her joy the fallen to raise.      }"
5203,_ELLEN._,"Nor would she nicely faults and merits weigh,"
5204,_ELLEN._,But loved the impulse of her soul t’ obey;      240
5205,_ELLEN._,"The prayers of all she heard, their sufferings view’d,"
5206,_ELLEN._,"Nor turn’d from any, save when Love pursued;"
5207,_ELLEN._,"For, though to love disposed, to kindness prone,"
5208,_ELLEN._,"She thought of Cecil, and she lived alone."
5209,_ELLEN._,Thus heard the lover of the life she past
5210,_ELLEN._,Till his return—and he return’d at last;
5211,_ELLEN._,"For he had saved, and was a richer man"
5212,_ELLEN._,Than when to teach and study he began;
5213,_ELLEN._,"Something his father left, and he could fly"
5214,_ELLEN._,To the loved country where he wish’d to die.      250
5215,_ELLEN._,"“And now,” he said, “this maid with gentle mind"
5216,_ELLEN._,"May I not hope to meet, as good, as kind,"
5217,_ELLEN._,As in the days when first her friend she knew
5218,_ELLEN._,And then could trust—and he indeed is true.
5219,_ELLEN._,"She knew my motives, and she must approve"
5220,_ELLEN._,The man who dared to sacrifice his love
5221,_ELLEN._,"And fondest hopes to virtue: virtuous she,"
5222,_ELLEN._,Nor can resent that sacrifice in me.”
5223,_ELLEN._,"He reason’d thus, but fear’d, and sought the friend"
5224,_ELLEN._,"In his own country, where his doubts must end.      260"
5225,_ELLEN._,"They then together to her dwelling came,"
5226,_ELLEN._,And by a servant sent her lover’s name—
5227,_ELLEN._,"modest youth, whom she before had known,"
5228,_ELLEN._,"His favourite then, and doubtless _then_ her own."
5229,_ELLEN._,They in the carriage heard the servants speak
5230,_ELLEN._,"At Ellen’s door—“A maid so heavenly meek,"
5231,_ELLEN._,Who would all pain extinguish! Yet will she
5232,_ELLEN._,"Pronounce my doom, I feel the certainty!”—"
5233,_ELLEN._,"“Courage!” the friend exclaim’d, “the lover’s fear"
5234,_ELLEN._,Grows without ground;” but Cecil would not hear:      270
5235,_ELLEN._,"He seem’d some dreadful object to explore,"
5236,_ELLEN._,"And fix’d his fearful eye upon the door,"
5237,_ELLEN._,Intensely longing for reply—the thing
5238,_ELLEN._,That must to him his future fortune bring;
5239,_ELLEN._,And now it brought! like Death’s cold hand it came—
5240,_ELLEN._,“The lady was a stranger to the name!”
5241,_ELLEN._,"Backward the lover in the carriage fell,"
5242,_ELLEN._,"Weak, but not fainting—“All,” said he, “is well!"
5243,_ELLEN._,Return with me—I have no more to seek!”
5244,_ELLEN._,And this was all the woful man would speak.      280
5245,_ELLEN._,"Quickly he settled all his worldly views,"
5246,_ELLEN._,"And sail’d from home, his fiercer pains to lose"
5247,_ELLEN._,And nurse the milder—now with labour less      }
5248,_ELLEN._,"He might his solitary world possess,      }"
5249,_ELLEN._,And taste the bitter-sweet of love in idleness.      }
5250,_ELLEN._,Greece was the land he chose; a mind decay’d      }
5251,_ELLEN._,And ruin’d there through glorious ruin stray’d;      }
5252,_ELLEN._,"There read, and walk’d, and mused—there loved, and wept, and pray’d."
5253,_ELLEN._,}
5254,_ELLEN._,"Nor would he write, nor suffer hope to live,"
5255,_ELLEN._,But gave to study all his mind could give;      290
5256,_ELLEN._,"Till, with the dead conversing, he began"
5257,_ELLEN._,"To lose the habits of a living man,"
5258,_ELLEN._,"Save that he saw some wretched, them he tried"
5259,_ELLEN._,"To soothe—some doubtful, them he strove to guide;"
5260,_ELLEN._,Nor did he lose the mind’s ennobling joy
5261,_ELLEN._,Of that new state that death must not destroy;
5262,_ELLEN._,What Time had done we know not—Death was nigh;      }
5263,_ELLEN._,To his first hopes the lover gave a sigh;      }
5264,_ELLEN._,But hopes more new and strong confirm’d his wish to die.      }
5265,_ELLEN._,Meantime poor Ellen in her cottage thought      300
5266,_ELLEN._,“That he would seek her—sure she should be sought
5267,_ELLEN._,"She did not mean—It was an evil hour,"
5268,_ELLEN._,"Her thoughts were guardless, and beyond her power;"
5269,_ELLEN._,"And for one speech, and that in rashness made!"
5270,_ELLEN._,Have I no friend to soothe him and persuade?
5271,_ELLEN._,"He must not leave me—He again will come,"
5272,_ELLEN._,"And we shall have one hope, one heart, one home!”"
5273,_ELLEN._,But when she heard that he on foreign ground
5274,_ELLEN._,"Sought his lost peace, hers never more was found;"
5275,_ELLEN._,But still she felt a varying hope that love      310
5276,_ELLEN._,Would all these slight impediments remove:—
5277,_ELLEN._,“Has he no friend to tell him that our pride
5278,_ELLEN._,Resents a moment and is satisfied?
5279,_ELLEN._,"Soon as the hasty sacrifice is made,"
5280,_ELLEN._,"A look will soothe us, and a tear persuade;"
5281,_ELLEN._,"Have I no friend to say ‘Return again,"
5282,_ELLEN._,"Reveal your wishes, and relieve her pain?’”"
5283,_ELLEN._,"With suffering mind the maid her prospects view’d,"
5284,_ELLEN._,That hourly varied with the varying mood;
5285,_ELLEN._,"As past the day, the week, the month, the year,      320"
5286,_ELLEN._,"The faint hope sicken’d, and gave place to fear."
5287,_ELLEN._,"No Cecil came!—“Come, peevish and unjust!”"
5288,_ELLEN._,"Sad Ellen cried, “why cherish this disgust?"
5289,_ELLEN._,Thy Ellen’s voice could charm thee once; but thou
5290,_ELLEN._,Canst nothing see or hear of Ellen now!”
5291,_ELLEN._,"Yes! she was right; the grave on him was closed,"
5292,_ELLEN._,And there the lover and the friend reposed.
5293,_ELLEN._,"The news soon reach’d her, and she then replied"
5294,_ELLEN._,In his own manner—“I am satisfied!”
5295,_ELLEN._,"To her a lover’s legacy is paid,      330"
5296,_ELLEN._,The darling wealth of the devoted maid;
5297,_ELLEN._,"From this her best and favourite books she buys,"
5298,_ELLEN._,From this are doled the favourite charities;
5299,_ELLEN._,"And when a tale or face affects her heart,"
5300,_ELLEN._,This is the fund that must relief impart.
5301,_ELLEN._,Such have the ten last years of Ellen been!
5302,_ELLEN._,Her very last that sunken eye has seen!
5303,_ELLEN._,That half-angelic being still must fade
5304,_ELLEN._,Till all the angel in the mind be made;—
5305,_ELLEN._,And now the closing scene will shortly come—      340
5306,_ELLEN._,She cannot visit sorrow at her home;
5307,_ELLEN._,But still she feeds the hungry; still prepares
5308,_ELLEN._,The usual softeners of the peasant’s cares;
5309,_ELLEN._,"And, though she prays not with the dying now,"
5310,_ELLEN._,"She teaches them to die, and shows them how."

5340,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,_WILLIAM BAILEY._
5341,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,
5342,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The letters Richard in a morning read
5343,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To quiet and domestic comforts led;
5344,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And George, who thought the world could not supply"
5345,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Comfort so pure, reflected with a sigh;"
5346,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Then would pursue the subject, half in play,"
5347,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Half earnest, till the sadness wore away."
5348,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They spoke of Passion’s errors, Love’s disease,"
5349,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"His pains, afflictions, wrongs, and jealousies;"
5350,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Of Herod’s vile commandment—that his wife
5351,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Should live no more, when he no more had life;      10"
5352,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He could not bear that royal Herod’s spouse
5353,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Should, as a widow, make her second vows;"
5354,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Or that a mortal with his queen should wed,"
5355,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Or be the rival of the mighty dead.
5356,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Herods,” said Richard, “doubtless may be found,"
5357,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But haply do not in the world abound;
5358,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Ladies, indeed, a dreadful lot would have,"
5359,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,If jealousy could act beyond the grave:
5360,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"No doubt Othellos every place supply,"
5361,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Though every Desdemona does not die;      20
5362,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But there are lovers in the world, who live"
5363,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Slaves to the sex, and every fault forgive.”"
5364,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“I know,” said George, “a happy man and kind,"
5365,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Who finds his wife is all he wish’d to find:
5366,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A mild, good man, who, if he nothing sees,"
5367,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Will suffer nothing to disturb his ease;
5368,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Who, ever yielding both to smiles and sighs,      }"
5369,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Admits no story that a wife denies—      }
5370,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She guides his mind, and she directs his eyes.      }"
5371,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Richard, there dwells within a mile a pair      30"
5372,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Of good examples—I will guide you there:
5373,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Such man is William Bailey—but his spouse
5374,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Is virtue’s self since she had made her vows.
5375,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"I speak of ancient stories, long worn out,"
5376,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,That honest William would not talk about;
5377,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But he will sometimes check her starting tear,"
5378,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And call her self-correction too severe.
5379,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“In their own inn the gentle pair are placed,"
5380,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Where you behold the marks of William’s taste.
5381,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They dwell in plenty, in respect, and peace,      40"
5382,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Landlord and lady of the Golden Fleece;
5383,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Public indeed their calling—but there come
5384,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"No brawl, no revel to that decent room;"
5385,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"All there is still, and comely to behold,"
5386,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Mild as the fleece, and pleasant as the gold."
5387,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But, mild and pleasant as they now appear,"
5388,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,They first experienced many a troubled year;
5389,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And that, if known, might not command our praise,"
5390,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Like the smooth tenor of their present days.
5391,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Our hostess, now so grave and steady grown,      50"
5392,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Has had some awkward trials of her own.
5393,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She was not always so resign’d and meek—
5394,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Yet can I little of her failings speak;
5395,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Those she herself will her misfortunes deem,"
5396,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And slides discreetly from the dubious theme.
5397,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But you shall hear the tale that I will tell,"
5398,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,When we have seen the mansion where they dwell.”
5399,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They saw the mansion,—and the couple made"
5400,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Obeisance due, and not without parade:"
5401,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“His honour, still obliging, took delight      60"
5402,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To make them pleasant in each other’s sight;
5403,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,It was their duty—they were very sure
5404,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,It was their pleasure.”
5405,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This they could endure,"
5406,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Nor turn’d impatient——In the room around
5407,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Were care and neatness: instruments were found
5408,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For sacred music, books with prints and notes"
5409,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"By learned men and good, whom William quotes"
5410,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In mode familiar—Beveridge, [Doddridge,] Hall,"
5411,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Pyle, Whitby, Hammond—he refers to all."
5412,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Next they beheld his garden, fruitful, nice,      70"
5413,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And, as he said, his little paradise."
5414,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In man and wife appear’d some signs of pride,"
5415,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Which they perceived not, or they would not hide—"
5416,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Their honest saving; their good name, their skill;      }"
5417,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"His honour’s land, which they had grace to till;      }"
5418,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And more, his favour shown, with all their [friends’] good will.” }"
5419,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This past, the visit was with kindness closed,"
5420,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And George was ask’d to do as he proposed.
5421,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Richard,” said he, “though I myself explore"
5422,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With no distaste the annals of the poor,      80"
5423,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And may with safety to a brother show      }
5424,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,What of my humble friends I chance to know:      }
5425,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Richard, there are who call the subjects low.      }"
5426,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“The host and hostess of the Fleece—’tis base—
5427,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Would I could cast some glory round the place!
5428,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“The lively heroine once adorn’d a farm—
5429,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And William’s virtue has a kind of charm;
5430,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Nor shall we, in our apprehension, need"
5431,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Riches or rank—I think I may proceed.
5432,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Virtue and worth there are who will not see      90
5433,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In humble dress; but low they cannot be.”
5434,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,
5435,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,*       *       *       *       *
5436,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,
5437,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The youth’s addresses pleased his favourite maid—      }
5438,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They wish’d for union, but were both afraid;      }"
5439,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,They saw the wedded poor—and fear the bliss delay’d;      }
5440,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Yet they appear’d a happier lass and swain
5441,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Than those who will not reason or refrain.
5442,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William was honest, simple, gentle, kind,"
5443,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Laborious, studious, and to thrift inclined;"
5444,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"More neat than youthful peasant in his dress,"
5445,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And yet so careful that it cost him less.      100
5446,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He kept from inns, though doomed an inn to keep,"
5447,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And all his pleasures and pursuits were cheap.
5448,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Yet would the youth perform a generous deed,"
5449,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,When reason saw or pity felt the need;
5450,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He of his labour and his skill would lend,"
5451,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Nay, of his money, to a suffering friend."
5452,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,William had manual arts—his room was graced
5453,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With carving quaint, that spoke the master’s taste;"
5454,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But if that taste admitted some dispute,"
5455,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He charm’d the nymphs with flageolet and flute.      110
5456,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Constant at church, and there a little proud,"
5457,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He sang with boldness, and he read aloud;"
5458,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Self-taught to write, he his example took"
5459,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And form’d his letters from a printed book.
5460,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,I’ve heard of ladies who profess’d to see
5461,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In a man’s writing what his mind must be;
5462,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"As Doctor Spurzheim’s pupils, when they look"
5463,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Upon a skull, will read it as a book—"
5464,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Our talents, tendencies, and likings trace,"
5465,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And find for all the measure and the place.      120
5466,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Strange times! when thus we are completely read
5467,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"By man or woman, by the hand or head!"
5468,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Believe who can—but William’s even mind
5469,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,All who beheld might in his writing find;
5470,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,His not the scratches where we try in vain
5471,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Meanings and words to construe or explain.
5472,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But with our village hero to proceed—
5473,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He read as learned clerks are wont to read;
5474,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Solemn he was in tone, and slow in pace,"
5475,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,By nature gifted both with strength and grace.      130
5476,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Black parted locks his polish’d forehead press’d;
5477,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,His placid looks an easy mind confess’d;
5478,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"His smile content, and seldom more, convey’d—      }"
5479,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Not like the smile of fair illusive maid,      }"
5480,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"When what she feels is hid, and what she wills betray’d.      }"
5481,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The lighter damsels call’d his manner prim,"
5482,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And laugh’d at virtue so array’d in him;
5483,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But they were wanton, as he well replied,"
5484,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And hoped their own would not be strongly tried:
5485,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Yet was he full of glee, and had his strokes      140"
5486,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Of rustic wit, his repartees and jokes;"
5487,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Nor was averse, ere yet he pledged his love,"
5488,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To stray with damsels in the shady grove;
5489,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"When he would tell them, as they walk’d along,"
5490,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"How the birds sang, and imitate their song."
5491,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In fact, our rustic had his proper taste;      }"
5492,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Was with peculiar arts and manners graced—      }
5493,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And Absolon had been, had Absolon been chaste.      }"
5494,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Frances, like William, felt her heart incline"
5495,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To neat attire—but Frances would be fine.      150
5496,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Though small the farm, the farmer’s daughter knew"
5497,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her rank in life, and she would have it too:"
5498,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This, and this only, gave the lover pain,"
5499,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He thought it needless, and he judged it vain."
5500,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Advice in hints he to the fault applied,"
5501,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And talk’d of sin, of vanity, and pride."
5502,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“And what is proud,” said Frances, “but to stand"
5503,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Singing at church, and sawing thus your hand?"
5504,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Looking at heaven above, as if to bring"
5505,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The holy angels down to hear you sing?      160
5506,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And, when you write, you try with all your skill,"
5507,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And cry, no wonder that you wrote so ill!"
5508,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For you were ever to yourself a rule,"
5509,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And humbly add, you never were at school—"
5510,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Is that not proud?—And I have heard beside,"
5511,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The proudest creatures have the humblest pride.
5512,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"If you had read the volumes I have hired,"
5513,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"You’d see your fault, nor try to be admired;"
5514,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,For they who read such books can always tell
5515,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The fault within, and read the mind as well.”      170"
5516,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,William had heard of hiring books before;
5517,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He knew she read, and he inquired no more."
5518,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,On him the subject was completely lost;
5519,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,What he regarded was the time and cost;
5520,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Yet that was trifling—just a present whim:
5521,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Novels and stories! what were they to him?”
5522,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With such slight quarrels, or with those as slight,"
5523,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They lived in love, and dream’d of its delight."
5524,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her duties Fanny knew, both great and small,"
5525,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And she with diligence observed them all.      180
5526,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"If e’er she fail’d a duty to fulfil,"
5527,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"’Twas childish error, not rebellious will;"
5528,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For her much reading, though it touch’d her heart,"
5529,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Could neither vice nor indolence impart.
5530,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Yet, when from William and her friends retired,"
5531,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She found her reading had her mind inspired
5532,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With hopes and thoughts of high mysterious things,"
5533,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Such as the early dream of kindness brings;
5534,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And then she wept, and wonder’d as she read,"
5535,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And new emotions in her heart were bred.      190
5536,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She sometimes fancied that, when love was true,"
5537,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,’Twas more than she and William ever knew;
5538,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,More than the shady lane in summer-eve;
5539,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,More than the sighing when he took his leave;
5540,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,More than his preference when the lads advance
5541,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And choose their partners for the evening dance;
5542,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Nay, more than midnight thoughts and morning dreams,"
5543,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Or talk when love and marriage are the themes:
5544,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In fact, a something not to be defined,      }"
5545,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Of all subduing, all commanding kind,      200}"
5546,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That fills the fondest heart, that rules the proudest mind.      }"
5547,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But on her lover Fanny still relied,      }"
5548,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her best companion, her sincerest guide,      }"
5549,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"On whom she could rely, in whom she would confide.      }"
5550,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,All jealous fits were past; in either now
5551,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Were tender wishes for the binding vow.
5552,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There was no secret one alone possess’d;
5553,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There was no hope that warm’d a single breast:
5554,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Both felt the same concerns their thoughts employ,"
5555,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And neither knew one solitary joy.      210
5556,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Then why so easy, William? why consent"
5557,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To wait so long? thou wilt at last repent;
5558,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Within a month,” does Care and Prudence say,"
5559,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"If all be ready, linger not a day;"
5560,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Ere yet the choice be made, on choice debate;"
5561,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But, having chosen, dally not with fate."
5562,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"While yet to wait the pair were half content,"
5563,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And half disposed their purpose to repent,"
5564,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A spinster-aunt, in some great baron’s place,"
5565,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Would see a damsel, pride of all her race;      220"
5566,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And Fanny, flatter’d by the matron’s call,"
5567,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Obey’d her aunt, and long’d to see the Hall."
5568,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For halls and castles in her fancy wrought,"
5569,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And she accounts of love and wonder sought;
5570,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There she expected strange events to learn,"
5571,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And take in tender secrets fond concern;
5572,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There she expected lovely nymphs to view,      }"
5573,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Perhaps to hear and meet their lovers too;      }
5574,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The Julias, tender souls! the Henrys kind and true.      }"
5575,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There she expected plottings to detect,      230"
5576,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And—but I know not what she might expect—
5577,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"All she was taught in books to be her guide,"
5578,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And all that nature taught the nymph beside.
5579,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Now that good dame had in the castle dwelt
5580,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,So long that she for all its people felt;
5581,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She kept her sundry keys, and ruled o’er all,"
5582,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Female and male, domestics in the hall;"
5583,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"By her lord trusted, worthy of her trust;"
5584,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Proud but obedient, bountiful but just."
5585,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She praised her lucky stars, that in her place      240"
5586,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She never found neglect, nor felt disgrace;"
5587,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"To do her duty was her soul’s delight,      }"
5588,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This her inferiors would to theirs excite,      }"
5589,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,This her superiors notice and requite;      }
5590,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"To either class she gave the praises due,"
5591,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And still more grateful as more favour’d grew.
5592,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her lord and lady were of peerless worth,"
5593,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In power unmatch’d, in glory and in birth;"
5594,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And such the virtue of the noble race,"
5595,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,It reach’d the meanest servant in the place.      250
5596,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"All, from the chief attendant on my lord"
5597,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"To the groom’s helper, had her civil word;"
5598,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"From Miss Montregor, who the ladies taught,"
5599,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To the rude lad who in the garden wrought;
5600,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"From the first favourite to the meanest drudge,"
5601,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Were no such women, heaven should be her judge;"
5602,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Whatever stains were theirs, let them reside"
5603,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In that pure place, and they were mundified;"
5604,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The sun of favour on their vileness shone,"
5605,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And all their faults like morning mists were gone.      260
5606,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There was Lord Robert! could she have her choice,"
5607,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,From the world’s masters he should have her voice;
5608,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"So kind and gracious in his noble ways,"
5609,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,It was a pleasure speaking in his praise;
5610,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And Lady Catharine—O! a prince’s pride
5611,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Might by one smile of hers be gratified;
5612,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With her would monarchs all their glory share,"
5613,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And in her presence banish all their care.
5614,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Such was the matron, and to her the maid"
5615,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Was by her lover carefully convey’d.      270
5616,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,When William first the invitation read
5617,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,It some displeasure in his spirit bred;
5618,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Not that one jealous thought the man possess’d:
5619,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He was by fondness, not by fear, distress’d;"
5620,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But, when his Fanny to his mind convey’d"
5621,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The growing treasures of the ancient maid;
5622,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The thirty years, come June, of service past;"
5623,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her lasting love, her life that would not last;"
5624,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Her power! her place! what interest! what respect
5625,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She had acquired—“and shall we her neglect?”—      280
5626,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“No, Frances, no!” he answer’d, “you are right;"
5627,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But things appear in such a different light!”
5628,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her parents blest her, and as well became"
5629,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Their love advised her, that they might not blame;"
5630,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They said, “If she should earl or countess meet"
5631,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She should be humble, cautious, and discreet;"
5632,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Humble, but not abased, remembering all"
5633,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Are kindred sinners—children of the fall;
5634,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That from the earth our being we receive,"
5635,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And are all equal when the earth we leave.”      290
5636,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,They then advised her in a modest way
5637,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To make replies to what my lord might say;
5638,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her aunt would aid her, who was now become"
5639,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With nobles noble, and with lords at home."
5640,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,So went the pair; and William told at night
5641,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Of a reception gracious and polite;
5642,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He spake of galleries long and pictures tall;
5643,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The handsome parlours, the prodigious hall;"
5644,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The busts, the statues, and the floors of stone;"
5645,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The storied arras, and the vast saloon,      300"
5646,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In which was placed an Indian chest and screen,"
5647,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,With figures such as he had never seen:
5648,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He told of these as men enraptured tell,"
5649,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And gave to all their praise, and all was well."
5650,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Left by the lover, the desponding maid"
5651,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Was of the matron’s ridicule afraid;
5652,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But, when she heard a welcome frank and kind,"
5653,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The wonted firmness repossess’d her mind;
5654,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Pleased by the looks of love her aunt display’d,"
5655,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her fond professions, and her kind parade.      310"
5656,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In her own room, and with her niece apart,"
5657,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She gave up all the secrets of her heart;
5658,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And, grown familiar, bid her Fanny come,"
5659,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Partake her cheer, and make herself at home."
5660,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Shut in that room, upon its cheerful board"
5661,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She laid the comforts of no vulgar hoard;
5662,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Then press’d the damsel both with love and pride,"
5663,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,For both she felt—and would not be denied.
5664,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Grace she pronounced before and after meat,"
5665,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And bless’d her God that she could talk and eat;      320
5666,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Then with new glee she sang her patron’s praise——
5667,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“He had no paltry arts, no pimping ways;"
5668,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She had the roast and boil’d of every day,"
5669,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,That sent the poor with grateful hearts away;
5670,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And she was grateful——Come, my darling, think"
5671,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Of them you love the best, and let us drink.”"
5672,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And now she drank the healths of those above,"
5673,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her noble friends, whom she must ever love;"
5674,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But not together, not the young and old,"
5675,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But one by one, the number duly told;      330"
5676,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And told their merits too—there was not one
5677,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Who had not said a gracious thing or done;
5678,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Nor could she praise alone, but she would take"
5679,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A cheerful glass for every favourite’s sake,"
5680,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And all were favourites—till the rosy cheek
5681,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Spoke for the tongue that nearly ceased to speak;
5682,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That rosy cheek that now began to shine,"
5683,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And show the progress of the rosy wine.
5684,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But there she ended—felt the singing head,"
5685,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Then pray’d as custom will’d, and so to bed.      340"
5686,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The morn was pleasant, and the ancient maid"
5687,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,With her fair niece about the mansion stray’d;
5688,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There was no room without th’ appropriate tale
5689,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Of blood and murder, female sprite or male;"
5690,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There was no picture that th’ historic dame
5691,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Pass’d by and gave not its peculiar fame;
5692,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The births, the visits, weddings, burials, all"
5693,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,That chanced for ages at the noble Hall.
5694,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"These, and each revolution, she could state,"
5695,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And give strange anecdotes of love and hate;      350
5696,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This was her first delight, her pride, her boast;      }"
5697,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She told of many an heiress, many a toast,      }"
5698,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Of Lady Ellen’s flight, of Lord Orlando’s ghost;      }"
5699,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The maid turn’d pale, and what should then ensue"
5700,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But wine and cake—the dame was frighten’d too.
5701,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The aunt and niece now walk’d about the grounds,"
5702,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And sometimes met the gentry in their rounds;
5703,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Do let us turn!” the timid girl exclaim’d—
5704,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Turn!” said the aunt, “of what are you ashamed?"
5705,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,What is there frightful in such looks as those?      360
5706,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"What is it, child, you fancy or suppose?"
5707,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Look at Lord Robert, see if you can trace"
5708,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,More than true honour in that handsome face!
5709,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"What! you must think, by blushing in that way,"
5710,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,My lord has something about love to say;
5711,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But I assure you that he never spoke
5712,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Such things to me in earnest or in joke;
5713,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And yet I meet him in all sorts of times,"
5714,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,When wicked men are thinking of their crimes.
5715,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There! let them pass——Why, yes, indeed ’tis true      370}"
5716,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That was a look, and was design’d for you;      }"
5717,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But what the wonder when the sight is new?      }
5718,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For my lord’s virtue you may take my word,"
5719,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He would not do a thing that was absurd.”
5720,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,A month had pass’d; “And when will Fanny come?”
5721,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The lover ask’d, and found the parents dumb;"
5722,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They had not heard for more than half the space,"
5723,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And the poor maiden was in much disgrace.
5724,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Silence so long they could not understand—
5725,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And this of one who wrote so neat a hand;      380
5726,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Their sister sure would send, were aught amiss;"
5727,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But youth is thoughtless—there is hope in this.
5728,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"As time elapsed, their wonder changed to wo:"
5729,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William would lose another day, and go."
5730,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Yet, if she should be wilful and remain,"
5731,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He had no power to take her home again.
5732,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But he would go.—He went, and he return’d—"
5733,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And in his look the pair his tale discern’d;
5734,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Stupid in grief, it seem’d not that he knew"
5735,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"How he came home, or what he should pursue.      390"
5736,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Fanny was gone!—her aunt was sick in bed,      }"
5737,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Dying, she said—none cared if she were dead;      }"
5738,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her charge, his darling, was decoy’d, was fled!      }"
5739,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But at what time, and whither, and with whom,"
5740,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"None seem’d to know—all surly, shy, or dumb."
5741,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Each blamed himself, all blamed the erring maid;"
5742,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They vow’d revenge, they cursed their fate, and pray’d."
5743,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Moved by his grief, the father sought the place,"
5744,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Ask’d for his girl, and talk’d of her disgrace;"
5745,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Spoke of the villain, on whose cursed head      400"
5746,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He pray’d that vengeance might be amply shed;
5747,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Then sought his sister, and beheld her grief,"
5748,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her pain, her danger,—this was no relief."
5749,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Where is my daughter? bring her to my sight!”—
5750,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Brother, I’m rack’d and tortured day and night.”—"
5751,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Talk not to me! What grief have you to tell,"
5752,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Is your soul rack’d, or is your bosom hell?"
5753,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Where is my daughter?”—“She would take her oath
5754,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For their right doing, for she knew them both,"
5755,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And my young lord was honour.”—“Woman, cease!      410}"
5756,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And give your guilty conscience no such peace—      }
5757,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"You’ve sold the wretched girl, you have betray’d your niece.”— }"
5758,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“The Lord be good! and O! the pains that come
5759,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In limb and body—Brother, get you home!"
5760,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Your voice runs through me—every angry word,"
5761,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"If he should hear it, would offend my lord.”—"
5762,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Has he a daughter? let her run away
5763,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With a poor dog, and hear what he will say!"
5764,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"No matter what, I’ll ask him for his son”—"
5765,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“And so offend? Now, brother, pray be gone!”      420"
5766,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"My lord appear’d, perhaps by pity moved,"
5767,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And kindly said he no such things approved;
5768,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Nay, he was angry with the foolish boy,"
5769,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Who might his pleasures at his ease enjoy;
5770,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The thing was wrong—he hoped the farm did well—
5771,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The angry father doom’d the farm to hell;
5772,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He then desired to see the villain-son,"
5773,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Though my lord warn’d him such excess to shun;
5774,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Told him he pardon’d, though he blamed such rage,"
5775,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And bade him think upon his state and age.      430
5776,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Think! yes, my lord! but thinking drives me mad—"
5777,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Give me my child!—Where is she to be had?
5778,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"I’m old and poor, but I with both can feel,"
5779,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And so shall he that could a daughter steal!
5780,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Think you, my lord, I can be so bereft"
5781,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And feel no vengeance for the villain’s theft?
5782,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Old if I am, could I the robber meet"
5783,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,I’d lay his breathless body at my feet—
5784,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Was that a smile, my lord? think you your boy"
5785,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Will both the father and the child destroy?”      440
5786,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"My lord replied—“I’m sorry, from my soul!"
5787,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But boys are boys, and there is no control.”—"
5788,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“So, for your great ones Justice slumbers, then!"
5789,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,If men are poor they must not feel as men—
5790,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Will your son marry?”—“Marry!” said my lord,"
5791,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Your daughter?—marry—no, upon my word!”"
5792,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“What then, our stations differ!—but your son"
5793,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Thought not of that—his crime has made them one,"
5794,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In guilt united—She shall be his wife,"
5795,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Or I th’ avenger that will take his life!”—      450
5796,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Old man, I pity and forgive you; rest      }"
5797,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In hope and comfort—be not so distress’d;      }
5798,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Things that seem bad oft happen for the best.      }
5799,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The girl has done no more than thousands do,"
5800,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Nor has the boy—they laugh at me and you.”—
5801,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“And this my vengeance—curse him!”—“Nay, forbear;"
5802,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"I spare your frenzy, in compassion spare.”—"
5803,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Spare me, my lord! and what have I to dread?"
5804,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"O! spare not, heaven, the thunder o’er his head—"
5805,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The bolt he merits!”——
5806,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Such was his redress;      460
5807,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And he return’d to brood upon distress.
5808,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And what of William?—William from the time
5809,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Appear’d partaker both of grief and crime;
5810,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He cared for nothing, nothing he pursued,"
5811,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But walk’d about in melancholy mood;
5812,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He ceased to labour—all he loved before
5813,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He now neglected, and would see no more;"
5814,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He said his flute brought only to his mind
5815,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"When he was happy, and his Fanny kind;"
5816,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And his loved walks, and every object near,      470"
5817,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And every evening-sound she loved to hear,"
5818,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The shady lane, broad heath, and starry sky,"
5819,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Brought home reflections, and he wish’d to die."
5820,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Yet there he stray’d, because he wish’d to shun"
5821,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The world he hated, where his part was done;"
5822,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"As if, though lingering on the earth, he there"
5823,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Had neither hope nor calling, tie nor care."
5824,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"At length a letter from the daughter came,"
5825,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"‘Frances’ subscribed, and that the only name;"
5826,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She “pitied much her parents, spoke of fate,      480"
5827,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And begg’d them to forget her, not to hate;"
5828,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Said she had with her all the world could give,"
5829,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And only pray’d that they in peace should live.
5830,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,That which is done is that we’re born to do—
5831,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This she was taught, and she believed it true;"
5832,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"True, that she lived in pleasure and delight,"
5833,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But often dream’d and saw the farm by night;
5834,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The boarded room that she had kept so neat,"
5835,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And all her roses in the window-seat;
5836,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The pear-tree shade, the jasmine’s lovely gloom,      490"
5837,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,With its long twigs that blossom’d in the room;
5838,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But she was happy, and the tears that fell      }"
5839,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,As she was writing had no grief to tell;      }
5840,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"We weep when we are glad, we sigh when we are well.”      }"
5841,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A bill inclosed, that they beheld with pain"
5842,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And indignation, they return’d again;"
5843,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There was no mention made of William’s name,"
5844,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Check’d as she was by pity, love, and shame."
5845,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William, who wrought for bread, and never sought"
5846,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"More than the day demanded when he wrought,      500"
5847,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Was to a sister call’d, of all his race"
5848,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The last, and dying in a distant place."
5849,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In tender terror he approach’d her bed,"
5850,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Beheld her sick, and buried her when dead;"
5851,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He was her heir, and what she left was more"
5852,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Than he required, who was content before."
5853,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With their minds’ sufferings, age, and growing pain,"
5854,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That ancient couple could not long remain,"
5855,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Nor long remain’d; and in their dying groan
5856,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The suffering youth perceived himself alone;      510
5857,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For of his health or sickness, peace or care,"
5858,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He knew not one in all the world to share.
5859,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Now every scene would sad reflections give,"
5860,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And most his home, and there he could not live;"
5861,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There every walk would now distressing prove,"
5862,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And of his loss remind him, and his love."
5863,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,With the small portion by his sister left
5864,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He roved about as one of peace bereft;
5865,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And by the body’s movements hoped to find
5866,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A kind of wearied stillness in the mind,      520"
5867,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And sooner bring it to a sleepy state,"
5868,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,As rocking infants will their pains abate.
5869,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Thus careless, lost, unheeding where he went,"
5870,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Nine weary years the wandering lover spent.
5871,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"His sole employment, all that could amuse,"
5872,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Was his companions on the road to choose;
5873,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With such he travell’d through the passing day,"
5874,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Friends of the hour, and walkers by the way;"
5875,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And from the sick, the poor, the halt, the blind,"
5876,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He learn’d the sorrows of his suffering kind.      530
5877,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He learn’d of many how unjust their fate,"
5878,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,For their connexions dwelt in better state;
5879,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They had relations famous, great or rich,"
5880,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Learned or wise, they never scrupled which;"
5881,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But while they cursed these kindred churls, would try"
5882,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"To build their fame, and for their glory lie."
5883,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Others delighted in misfortunes strange,"
5884,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The sports of fortune in her love for change.
5885,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Some spoke of wonders they before had seen,"
5886,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,When on their travels they had wandering been:      540
5887,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"How they had sail’d the world about, and found"
5888,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"The sailing plain, although the world was round;"
5889,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,How they beheld for months th’ unsetting sun;      }
5890,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,What deeds they saw! what they themselves had done!—      }
5891,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,What leaps at Rhodes!—what glory then they won!      }
5892,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There were who spoke in terms of high disdain
5893,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Of their contending against power in vain;
5894,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Suffering from tyranny of law long borne;
5895,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And life’s best spirits in contentions worn.
5896,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Happy in this, th’ oppressors soon will die,      550}"
5897,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Each with the vex’d and suffering man to lie—      }
5898,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And thus consoled exclaim, ‘And is not sorrow dry?’      }"
5899,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But vice offended: when he met with those
5900,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Who could a deed of violence propose,"
5901,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And cry, “Should they what we desire possess?      }"
5902,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Should they deprive us, and their laws oppress?”      }"
5903,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William would answer, “Ours is not redress.”—      }"
5904,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Would you oppression, then, for ever feel?”—"
5905,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“’Tis not my choice; but yet I must not steal.”—
5906,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“So, first they cheat us, and then make their laws      560"
5907,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To guard their treasures and to back their cause:
5908,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"What call you then, my friend, the rights of man?”—"
5909,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“To get his bread,” said William, “if he can;"
5910,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And if he cannot, he must then depend      }"
5911,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Upon a Being he may make his friend.”—      }
5912,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Make!” they replied; and conference had end.      }
5913,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But female vagrants would at times express
5914,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,A new-born pleasure at the mild address;
5915,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"His modest wish, clothed in accent meek,"
5916,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,That they would comfort in religion seek.      570
5917,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“I am a sinful being!” William cried;
5918,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Then, what am I?” the conscious heart replied;"
5919,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And oft-times ponder’d in a pensive way,"
5920,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“He is not happy, yet he loves to pray.”"
5921,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But some would freely on his thoughts intrude,"
5922,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And thrust themselves ’twixt him and solitude;
5923,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"They would his faith and of its strength demand,"
5924,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And all his soul’s prime motions understand.
5925,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“How!” they would say, “such we and such belief,"
5926,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Such trust in heaven, and yet on earth such grief!      580"
5927,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Thou art almost, my friend—thou art not all;"
5928,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Thou hast not yet the self-destroying call;
5929,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Thou hast a carnal wish, perhaps a will"
5930,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Not yet subdued—the root is growing still.
5931,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There is the strong man yet that keeps his own,"
5932,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Who by a stronger must be overthrown;
5933,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There is the burden that must yet be gone,"
5934,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And then the pilgrim may go singing on.”
5935,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William to this would seriously incline,"
5936,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And to their comforts would his heart resign;      590
5937,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"It soothed, it raised him—he began to feel"
5938,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Th’ enlivening warmth of methodistic zeal;
5939,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He learn’d to know the brethren by their looks—
5940,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He sought their meetings, he perused their books;"
5941,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But yet was not within the pale and yoke,"
5942,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And as a novice of experience spoke;
5943,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But felt the comfort, and began to pray"
5944,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,For such companions on the king’s highway.
5945,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William had now across the kingdom sped,"
5946,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To th’ Eastern ocean from St. David’s head;      600
5947,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And wandering late, with various thoughts oppress’d,"
5948,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,’Twas midnight ere he reach’d his place of rest—
5949,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A village inn, that one way-faring friend"
5950,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Could from experience safely recommend:
5951,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Where the kind hostess would be more intent
5952,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,On what he needed than on what he spent;
5953,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her husband, once a heathen, she subdued,"
5954,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And with religious fear his mind imbued;
5955,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Though his conviction came too late to save
5956,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,An erring creature from an early grave.      610
5957,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Since that event, the cheerful widow grew      }"
5958,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In size and substance—her the brethren knew—      }
5959,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And many friends were hers, and lovers not a few;      }"
5960,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But either love no more could warm her heart,"
5961,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Or no man came who could the warmth impart.
5962,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"William drew near, and saw the comely look"
5963,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Of the good lady, bending o’er her book;"
5964,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Hymns it appear’d—for now a pleasing sound
5965,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Seem’d as a welcome in his wanderings found.
5966,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He enter’d softly, not as they who think      620"
5967,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That they may act the ruffian if they drink,"
5968,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And who conceive, that for their paltry pence"
5969,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,They may with rules of decency dispense;
5970,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Far unlike these was William—he was kind,"
5971,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Exacting nothing, and to all resign’d."
5972,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He saw the hostess reading,—and their eyes"
5973,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Met in good will, and something like surprise."
5974,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"It was not beauty William saw, but more,"
5975,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Something like that which he had loved before—
5976,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Something that brought his Fanny to his view,      630"
5977,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In the dear time when she was good and true;
5978,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And his, it seem’d, were features that were seen      }"
5979,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,With some emotion—she was not serene;      }
5980,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And both were moved to ask what looks like those could mean.      }
5981,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"At first, she colour’d to the deepest red,"
5982,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"That hurried off, till all the rose was fled;"
5983,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She call’d a servant, whom she sent to rest,"
5984,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Then made excuse to her attentive guest;
5985,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"She own’d the thoughts confused—’twas very true,"
5986,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He brought a dear departed friend in view;      640
5987,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Then, as he listen’d, bade him welcome there      }"
5988,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With livelier looks and more engaging air,      }"
5989,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And stirr’d the fire of ling, and brush’d the wicker chair;      }"
5990,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Waiting his order, with the cheerful look"
5991,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,That proved how pleasant were the pains she took.
5992,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,He was refresh’d——They spake on various themes—      }
5993,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Our early pleasures, Reason’s first-drawn schemes,      }"
5994,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Youth’s strong illusions, Love’s delirious dreams;      }"
5995,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Then from her book he would presume to ask
5996,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A song of praise, and she perform’d the task.      650"
5997,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The clock struck twelve—He started—‘Must I go?’
5998,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"His looks spoke plainly, and the lady’s, ‘No;’"
5999,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"So down he sat—and, when the clock struck one,"
6000,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There was no start, no effort to be gone;"
6001,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Nor stay’d discourse——
6002,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“And so your loves were cross’d,"
6003,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And the loved object to your wishes lost?
6004,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But was she faithless, or were you to blame?"
6005,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,I wish I knew her—Will you tell her name?”—
6006,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Excuse me—that would hurt her if alive;
6007,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And, if no more, why should her fault survive?”      660"
6008,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“But love you still?”—
6009,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Alas! I feel I do,"
6010,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,When I behold her very looks in you!”—
6011,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Yet, if the frail one’s name must not be known,"
6012,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,My friendly guest may trust me with his own.”
6013,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This done, the lady paused, and then replied—"
6014,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,It grieves me much to see your spirit tried;—
6015,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But she was like me—how I came to know
6016,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The lamb that stray’d I will hereafter show.—
6017,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,We were indeed as sisters——Should I state
6018,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Her quiet end, you would no longer hate;      670"
6019,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"I see your heart—and I shall quickly prove,"
6020,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Though she deserved not, yet she priced your love:"
6021,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Long as she breathed was heard her William’s name—
6022,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And such affection half absolves her shame.
6023,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“Weep not, but hear me, how I came to know"
6024,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Thee and thy Frances—this to heaven I owe;
6025,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And thou shalt view the pledge, the very ring,"
6026,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The birth-day token—well you know the thing;
6027,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"‘This,’ if I ever—thus I was to speak,"
6028,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,As she had spoken—but I see you weak:      680
6029,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She was not worthy——”
6030,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“O! you cannot tell
6031,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,By what accursed means my Fanny fell!
6032,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"What bane, compulsion, threats—for she was pure;"
6033,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But from such toils what being is secure?
6034,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Force, not persuasion, robb’d me——”"
6035,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“You are right;
6036,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"So has she told me, in her Maker’s sight:"
6037,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She loved not vice——”
6038,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“O! no—her heart approved
6039,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,All that her God commanded to be loved;
6040,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And she is gone”——
6041,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Consider! death alone
6042,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Could for the errors of her life atone.”—      690
6043,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“Speak not of them; I would she knew how dear
6044,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,I hold her yet!—But dost thou give the tear
6045,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,To my loved Frances?—No! I cannot part
6046,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With one who has her face, who has her heart."
6047,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"With looks so pleasing, when I thee behold,"
6048,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,She lives—that bosom is no longer cold—
6049,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Then tell me—Art thou not—in pity speak—
6050,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"One whom I sought, while living meant to seek—"
6051,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Art thou my Fanny?—Let me not offend—
6052,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Be something to me—be a sufferer’s friend—      700
6053,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Be more—be all! ——The precious truth confess—      }
6054,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Art thou not Frances?”——      }
6055,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"“O, my William! yes!      }"
6056,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"But spare me, spare thyself, and suffer less.      }"
6057,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In my best days, the spring-time of my life,"
6058,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,I was not worthy to be William’s wife;
6059,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"A widow now—not poor, indeed—not cast"
6060,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"In outer darkness—sorrowing for the past,"
6061,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And for the future hoping—but no more:
6062,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Let me the pledges of thy love restore,"
6063,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,And give the ring thou gavest—let it be      710
6064,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,A token still of my regard for thee—
6065,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,But only that—and to a worthier now
6066,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Consign the gift.”——
6067,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,“The only worthy thou!”
6068,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Replied the lover; and what more express’d
6069,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,May be omitted—here our tale shall rest.
6070,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"This pair, our host and hostess of the Fleece,"
6071,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Command some wealth, and smile at its increase;"
6072,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"Saving and civil, cautious and discreet,"
6073,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,All sects and parties in their mansion meet;
6074,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There from their chapels teachers go to share      720
6075,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,The creature-comforts—mockery grins not there;
6076,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"There meet the wardens at their annual feast,"
6077,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,With annual pun—‘the parish must be fleeced’;
6078,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,There traders find a parlour cleanly swept
6079,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"For their reception, and in order kept;"
6080,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"And there the sons of labour, poor, but free,"
6081,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,Sit and enjoy their hour of liberty.
6082,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,So live the pair—and life’s disasters seem
6083,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In their unruffled calm a troubled dream;
6084,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,In comfort runs the remnant of their life—      730
6085,_WILLIAM BAILEY._,"He the fond husband, she the faithful wife."

6106,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,In their discourse again the Brothers dwelt
6107,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"On early subjects—what they once had felt,"

6110,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"George then reverted to the days of old,"
6111,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"When his heart fainted, and his hope was cold;"
6112,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"When by the power of fancy he was sway’d,"
6113,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And every impulse of the mind obey’d.
6114,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Then, my dear Richard,” said the ‘Squire, “my case"

6119,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The fine old mansion yet was left to stand,"
6120,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Not in this state, but old and much decay’d;"
6121,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Of this a part was habitable made;
6122,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The rest—who doubts?—was by the spirits seized,"
6123,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Ghosts of all kinds, who used it as they pleased."
6124,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“The worthy farmer tenant yet remain’d,"
6125,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Of good report—he had a fortune gain’d;      20
6126,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And his three daughters at their school acquired
6127,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The air and manner that their swains admired;
6128,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The mother-gossip and these daughters three
6129,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Talk’d of genteel and social company,"
6130,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And, while the days were fine, and walks were clean,"
6131,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A fresh assemblage day by day were seen.
6132,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“There were the curate’s gentle maids, and some"
6133,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,From all the neighbouring villages would come;
6134,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"There, as I stole the yew-tree shades among,"
6135,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I saw the parties walking, old and young,      30"
6136,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Where I was nothing—if perceived, they said,"
6137,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘The man is harmless, be not you afraid;"

6139,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"In love, and has in part his senses lost—"
6140,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"His health for certain, and he comes to spend"
6141,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,His time with us; we hope our air will mend
6142,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"A frame so weaken’d, for the learned tribe"
6143,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A change of air for stubborn ills prescribe;
6144,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And doing nothing often has prevail’d
6145,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,When ten physicians have prescribed and fail’d;      40
6146,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Not that for air or change there’s much to say,"
6147,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,But nature then has time to take her way;
6148,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And so we hope our village will restore
6149,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,This man to health that he possess’d before.
6150,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"He loves the garden avenues, the gloom      }"

6156,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"This harmless cypher, seeming not to see,"
6157,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet seeing all—unnoticed to appear,"
6158,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet noting all; and not disposed to hear,"
6159,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But to go forth—break in on no one’s plan,"
6160,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And hear them speak of the forsaken man.
6161,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“In scenes like these, a mansion so decay’d,"
6162,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"With blighted trees in hoary moss array’d,"
6163,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And ivy’d walls around, for many an hour"
6164,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I walk’d alone, and felt their witching power;"
6165,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,So others felt;—the young of either sex      60
6166,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Would in these walks their timid minds perplex
6167,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"By meeting terrors, and the old appear’d,"
6168,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Their fears upbraiding, like the young who fear’d."
6169,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Among them all some sad discourse at night
6170,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Was sure to breed a terrified delight:
6171,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Some luckless one of the attentive dames
6172,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Had figures seen like those within the frames,"
6173,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Figures of lords who once the land posses’d,"
6174,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And who could never in their coffins rest;
6175,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Unhappy spirits! who could not abide      70}
6176,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The loss of all their consequence and pride;      }
6177,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"’Twas death in all his power, their very names had died.      }"
6178,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“These tales of terror views terrific bred,"

6193,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The frighten’d bat’s low shriek, the beetle’s hum,"
6194,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,With nameless sounds we know not whence they come.
6195,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Such was the evening; and that ancient seat
6196,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The scene where then some neighbours chanced to meet.
6197,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Up to the door led broken steps of stone,"
6198,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Whose dewy surface in the moonlight shone;      90
6199,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"On vegetation, that with progress slow"
6200,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Where man forbears to fix his foot, will grow;"
6201,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The window’s depth and dust repell’d the ray
6202,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Of the moon’s light and of the setting day;
6203,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Pictures there were, and each display’d a face"
6204,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And form that gave their sadness to the place;
6205,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The frame and canvas show’d that worms unseen,"
6206,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Save in their works, for years had working been;"
6207,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A fire of brushwood on the irons laid      }
6208,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"All the dull room in fitful views display’d,      100}"
6209,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And with its own wild light in fearful forms array’d.      }
6210,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"In this old Hall, in this departing day,"
6211,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Assembled friends and neighbours, grave and gay;"
6212,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,When one good lady at a picture threw
6213,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A glance that caused inquiry.—“Tell us who?”
6214,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“That was a famous warrior; one, they said,"
6215,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,That by a spirit was awhile obey’d;
6216,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"In all his dreadful battles he would say,"
6217,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘Or win or lose, I shall escape to-day’;"
6218,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And, though the shot as thick as hail came round,      110"
6219,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,On no occasion he received a wound;
6220,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"He stood in safety, free from all alarm,"
6221,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Protected, heaven forgive him, by his charm."
6222,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But he forgot the date, till came the hour"
6223,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,When he no more had the protecting power;
6224,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And then he bade his friends around farewell!
6225,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘I fall!’ he cried, and in the instant fell."
6226,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,“Behold those infants in the frame beneath!
6227,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A witch offended wrought their early death;
6228,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"She form’d an image, made as wax to melt,      120"
6229,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And each the wasting of the figure felt;
6230,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The hag confess’d it when she came to die,"
6231,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And no one living can the truth deny.
6232,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“But see a beauty in King William’s days,"
6233,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"With that long waist, and those enormous stays;"
6234,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"She had three lovers, and no creature knew"
6235,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The one preferr’d, or the discarded two;"
6236,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,None could the secret of her bosom see;
6237,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Loving, poor maid, th’ attention of the three,"
6238,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"She kept such equal weight in either scale,      130"
6239,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,’Twas hard to say who would at last prevail.
6240,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Thus, you may think, in either heart arose"
6241,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"A jealous anger, and the men were foes;"
6242,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Each with himself concluded, two aside,"
6243,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The third may make the lovely maid his bride:
6244,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,This caused their fate—It was on Thursday night
6245,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The deed was done, and bloody was the fight;"
6246,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Just as she went, poor thoughtless girl! to prayers,"
6247,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Ran wild the maid with horror up the stairs;
6248,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Pale as a ghost, but not a word she said,      140"
6249,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And then the lady utter’d, ‘Coates is dead!’"
6250,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Then the poor damsel found her voice and cried,      }"
6251,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘Ran through the body, and that instant died!      }"
6252,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But he pronounced your name, and so was satisfied.’      }"
6253,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"A second fell, and he who did survive"
6254,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Was kept by skill and sovereign drugs alive;
6255,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘O! would she see me!’ he was heard to say,"
6256,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,‘No! I’ll torment him to his dying day!’
6257,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The maid exclaim’d; and every Thursday night
6258,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Her spirit came his wretched soul to fright.      150
6259,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Once, as she came, he cried aloud ‘Forgive!’"
6260,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘Never!’ she answer’d, ‘never while you live,"
6261,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Nor when you die, as long as time endures;"
6262,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"You have my torment been, and I’ll be yours!’"
6263,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"That is the lady, and the man confess’d"
6264,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Her vengeful spirit would not let him rest.”
6265,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,“But are there ghosts?” exclaim’d a timid maid;
6266,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,“My father tells me not to be afraid;
6267,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"He cries, when buried we are safe enough,"
6268,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And calls such stories execrable stuff.”      160
6269,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Your father, child,” the former lady cried,"
6270,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Has learning much, but he has too much pride;"
6271,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,It is impossible for him to tell
6272,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"What things in nature are impossible,"
6273,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Or out of nature, or to prove to whom"
6274,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Or for what purposes a ghost may come;
6275,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"It may not be intelligence to bring,"
6276,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,But to keep up a notion of the thing;
6277,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And though from one such fact there may arise
6278,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"An hundred wild improbabilities,      170"
6279,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet had there never been the truth, I say,"
6280,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The very lies themselves had died away.”
6281,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“True,” said a friend; “Heaven doubtless may dispense"
6282,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A kind of dark and clouded evidence;
6283,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,God has not promised that he will not send
6284,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A spirit freed to either foe or friend;
6285,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"He may such proof, and only such, bestow,"
6286,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Though we the certain truth can never know;
6287,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And therefore, though such floating stories bring"
6288,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"No strong or certain vouchers of the thing,      180"
6289,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Still would I not, presuming, pass my word"
6290,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,That all such tales were groundless and absurd.”
6291,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“But you will grant,” said one who sate beside,"
6292,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,“That all appear so when with judgment tried?”
6293,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“For that concession, madam, you may call,"
6294,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,When we have sate in judgment upon all.”
6295,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"An ancient lady, who with pensive smile"
6296,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Had heard the stories, and been mute the while,"
6297,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Now said, “Our prudence had been better shown"
6298,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,By leaving uncontested things unknown;      190
6299,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet, if our children must such stories hear,"
6300,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Let us provide some antidotes to fear;
6301,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"For all such errors in the minds of youth,"
6302,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"In any mind, the only cure is truth;"
6303,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And truths collected may in time decide
6304,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Upon such facts, or prove, at least, a guide."
6305,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"If, then, permitted I will fairly state"
6306,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"One fact, nor doubt the story I relate;"
6307,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I for your perfect acquiescence call,      }"
6308,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,’Tis of myself I tell.”——“O! tell us all!”      200}
6309,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Said every being there; then silent was the Hall.      }

6314,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Of man’s true honour I had noble proof;
6315,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"A generous lover who was worthy found,"
6316,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Where half his sex are hollow and unsound.

6323,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Then hastening on and threatening in its speed;
6324,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,It mock’d the powers of medicine; day by day
6325,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,I saw those helpers sadly walk away;
6326,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"So came the hand-like cloud, and with such power"
6327,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And with such speed, that brought the mighty shower."
6328,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Him nursed I dying, and we freely spoke"
6329,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Of what might follow the expected stroke;
6330,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"We talk’d of spirits, of their unknown powers,"
6331,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And dared to dwell on what the fate of ours;      220
6332,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But the dread promise, to appear again,"
6333,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Could it be done, I sought not to obtain;"
6334,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But yet we were presuming—‘Could it be,’"
6335,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"He said, ‘O Emma! I would come to thee!’"
6336,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“At his last hour his reason, late astray,"
6337,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Again return’d t’ illuminate his way.
6338,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,“In the last night my mother long had kept
6339,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Unwearied watch, and now reclined and slept;"
6340,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The nurse was dreaming in a distant chair,"
6341,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And I had knelt to soothe him with a prayer;      230

6354,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I judged it right, and was resolved to grieve.      240"
6355,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I lost my mother when there lived not one,"
6356,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Man, woman, child, whom I would seek or shun."
6357,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“The Dean, my uncle, with congenial gloom,"
6358,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Said, ‘Will you share a melancholy home?’"

6367,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Nor fell within, but till the day was gone"
6368,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The red faint fire upon the window shone.

6371,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Till I perceived no light, nor heard a sound,"
6372,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,That gave me notice of a world around.
6373,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Then had I grief’s proud thoughts, and said, in tone"
6374,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Of exultation, ‘World, I am alone!      260"
6375,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I care not for thee, thou art vile and base,"

6380,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Although but little in the world they gain;

6392,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And, saying this, I at the altar knelt,"
6393,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And painful joys and rapturous anguish felt;
6394,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Till strong, bold hopes possess’d me, and I cried,      280"
6395,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,‘Even at this instant is he at my side;

6403,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And thus th’ impression day by day renew’d;
6404,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I saw him always, always loved to see,      290"
6405,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"For, when alone, he was my company;"
6406,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"In company, with him alone I seem’d,"
6407,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And, if not dreaming, was as one who dream’d."
6408,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Thus, robb’d of sleep, I found, when evening came,"
6409,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,A pleasing torpor steal upon my frame;
6410,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,But still the habit drew my languid feet
6411,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,To the loved darkness of the favourite seat;
6412,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And there, by silence and by sadness press’d,"
6413,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I felt a world my own, and was at rest."
6414,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“One night, when urged with more than usual zeal,      300"
6415,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And feeling all that such enthusiasts feel,"
6416,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I paced the altar by, the pillars round,"
6417,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And knew no terror in the sacred ground;
6418,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,For mine were thoughts that banish’d all such fear—
6419,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I wish’d, I long’d, to have that form appear;"
6420,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And, as I paced the sacred aisles, I cried,"
6421,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,‘Let not thy Emma’s spirit be denied
6422,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The sight of thine; or if I may not see,"
6423,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Still by some token let her certain be!’
6424,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“At length the anxious thoughts my strength subdued,      310"
6425,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And sleep o’erpower’d me in my solitude;
6426,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Then was I dreaming of unearthly race,"
6427,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The glorious inmates of a blessed place;
6428,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Where lofty minds celestial views explore,"
6429,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Heaven’s bliss enjoy, and heaven’s great King adore;"
6430,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Him there I sought whom I had loved so well—
6431,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,For sure he dwelt where happy spirits dwell!
6432,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“While thus engaged, I started at a sound,"
6433,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Of what I knew not, but I look’d around;"
6434,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"For I was borne on visionary wings,      320"
6435,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And felt no dread of sublunary things;
6436,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But rising, walk’d.—A distant window threw"
6437,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"A weak, soft light, that help’d me in my view;"
6438,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Something with anxious heart I hoped to see,"
6439,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And pray’d, ‘O! God of all things, let it be!"
6440,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"For all are thine, were made by thee, and thou"
6441,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Canst both the meeting and the means allow;
6442,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Thou canst make clear my sight, or thou canst make"
6443,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"More gross the form that his loved mind shall take,"
6444,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Canst clothe his spirit for my fleshly sight,      330"
6445,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Or make my earthly sense more pure and bright.’
6446,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“So was I speaking, when without a sound"
6447,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,There was a movement in the sacred ground:
6448,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I saw a figure rising, but could trace"
6449,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"No certain features, no peculiar face;"
6450,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But I prepared my mind that form to view,"
6451,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Nor felt a doubt—he promised, and was true!"
6452,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I should embrace his angel, and my clay,"
6453,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And what was mortal in me, melt away."
6454,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“O! that ecstatic horror in my frame,      340"
6455,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"That o’er me thus, a favour’d mortal, came!"
6456,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Bless’d beyond mortals—and the body now
6457,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I judged would perish, though I knew not how;"
6458,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,The gracious power around me could translate
6459,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And make me pass to that immortal state:
6460,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Thus shall I pay the debt that must be paid,"
6461,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And dying live, nor be by death delay’d;"
6462,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And when so changed, I should with joy sustain"
6463,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The heavenly converse, and with him remain."
6464,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“I saw the distant shade, and went with awe,      350"
6465,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But not with terror, to the form I saw;"
6466,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet slowly went, for he I did believe"
6467,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Would meet, and soul to soul his friend receive;"
6468,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"So on I drew, concluding in my mind,"
6469,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,I cannot judge what laws may spirits bind;
6470,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Though I dissolve, and mingle with the blest,      }"
6471,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I am a new and uninstructed guest,      }"
6472,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And ere my love can speak, he should be first address’d.      }"
6473,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Thus I began to speak—my new-born pride,"
6474,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"My love, and daring hope, the words supplied.      360"
6475,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“‘Dear, happy shade! companion of the good,"
6476,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The just, the pure, do I on thee intrude?"
6477,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Art thou not come my spirit to improve,"
6478,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"To form, instruct, and fit me for thy love,"
6479,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And, as in love we parted, to restore"
6480,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The blessing lost, and then to part no more?"
6481,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Let me with thee in thy pure essence dwell,"
6482,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Nor go to bid them of my house farewell,"
6483,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,But thine be ever!’—How shall I relate
6484,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Th’ event that finish’d this ecstatic state?      370
6485,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet let me try.—It turn’d, and I beheld"
6486,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"An hideous form, that hope and zeal expell’d:"
6487,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"In a dim light the horrid shape appeared,"
6488,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"That wisdom would have fled, and courage fear’d:"
6489,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Pale, and yet bloated, with distorted eyes      }"
6490,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Distant and deep, a mouth of monstrous size,      }"
6491,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,That would in day’s broad glare a simple maid surprise.      }
6492,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"He heard my words, and cried, with savage shout,"
6493,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,‘Bah!—bother!—blarney!—What is this about?’
6494,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“Love, lover, longing, in an instant fled,—      380"
6495,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Now I had vice and impudence to dread;
6496,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And all my high-wrought fancies died away
6497,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"To woman’s trouble, terror, and dismay."
6498,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“‘What,’ said the wretch, ‘what is it you would have?"
6499,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Would’st hang a man for peeping in a grave?
6500,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Search me yourself, and try if you can feel"
6501,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Aught I have taken—there was nought to steal:
6502,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,’Twas told they buried with the corpse enough
6503,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"To pay the hazard—I have made the proof,"
6504,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Nor gain’d a tester—What I tell is true;      390}
6505,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"But I’m no fool, to be betray’d by you—      }"
6506,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"I’ll hazard nothing, curse me if I do!’      }"
6507,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“The light increased, and plainly now appear’d"
6508,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"A knavish fool, whom I had often fear’d,"
6509,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,But hid the dread; and I resolved at least
6510,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Not to expose it to the powerful beast.
6511,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“‘Come, John,’ I said, suppressing fear and doubt,"
6512,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘Walk on before, and let a lady out!’—"
6513,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘Lady!’ the wretch replied, with savage grin,"
6514,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,‘Apply to him that let the lady in:      400
6515,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"What! you would go, I take it, to the Dean,"
6516,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And tell him what your ladyship has seen’.
6517,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“When thus the fool exposed the knave, I saw      }"
6518,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The means of holding such a mind in awe,      }"
6519,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,And gain my safety by his dread of law.      }
6520,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“‘Alas!’ I cried, ‘I fear the Dean like you,"
6521,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"For I transgress, and am in trouble too."
6522,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"If it be known that we are here, as sure"
6523,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,As here we are we must the law endure:
6524,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Each other’s counsel therefore let us keep,      410"
6525,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"And each steal homeward to our beds and sleep,’"
6526,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“‘Steal!’ said the ruffian’s conscience—‘Well, agreed;"
6527,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Steal on, and let us to the door proceed:’—"
6528,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet, ere he moved, he stood awhile, and took"
6529,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Of my poor form a most alarming look;
6530,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"‘But, hark!’ I cried, and he to move began—"
6531,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,Escape alone engaged the dreadful man;
6532,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,With eager hand I oped the ponderous door—
6533,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"The wretch rush’d by me, and was heard no more."
6534,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"“So I escaped,—and when my dreams came on,      420"
6535,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,I check’d the madness by the thoughts of John;
6536,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,"Yet say I not what can or cannot be,"
6537,_THE CATHEDRAL-WALK._,But give the story of my ghost and me.”

6560,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,
6561,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,There was a widow in the village known
6562,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To our good Squire, and he had favour shown"
6563,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,By frequent bounty.—She as usual came;
6564,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And Richard saw the worn and weary frame,"
6565,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Pale cheek, and eye subdued, of her whose mind      }"
6566,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Was grateful still, and glad a friend to find,      }"
6567,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Though to the world long since and all its hopes resign’d.      }
6568,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Her easy form, in rustic neatness clad,"
6569,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Was pleasing still! but she for ever sad.
6570,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Deep is her grief?” said Richard—“Truly deep,      10"
6571,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And very still, and therefore seems to sleep."
6572,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To borrow simile to paint her woes,"
6573,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Theirs, like the river’s, motion seems repose,"
6574,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Making no petty murmuring—settled, slow,"
6575,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"They never waste, they never overflow."
6576,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Rachel is one of those—for there are some
6577,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Who look for nothing in their days to come,"
6578,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"No good nor evil, neither hope nor fear;"
6579,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Nothing remains or cheerful or severe;
6580,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"One day is like the past, the year’s sweet prime      20"
6581,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Like the sad fall—for Rachel heeds not time.
6582,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Nothing remains to agitate her breast;
6583,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Spent is the tempest, and the sky at rest;"
6584,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But, while it raged, her peace its ruin met;"
6585,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And now the sun is on her prospects set.—
6586,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Leave her, and let us her distress explore:"
6587,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,She heeds it not—she has been left before.”

6591,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There were two lads, call’d Shelley, hither brought,"
6592,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But whence we know not—it was never sought;
6593,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Their wandering mother left them, left her name,      30"
6594,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And the boys throve and valiant men became:
6595,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Handsome, of more than common size, and tall,"
6596,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, no one’s kindred, seem’d beloved of all;"
6597,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"All seem’d alliance by their deeds to prove,"
6598,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And loved the youths who could not claim their love.
6599,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"One was call’d James, the more sedate and grave,"
6600,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The other Robert—names their neighbours gave;
6601,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"They both were brave, but Robert loved to run"
6602,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And meet his danger—James would rather shun
6603,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The dangerous trial; but, whenever tried,      40"
6604,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He all his spirit to the act applied.
6605,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Robert would aid on any man bestow,      }"
6606,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James would his man and the occasion know;      }
6607,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,For that was quick and prompt—this temperate and slow.      }
6608,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Robert would all things he desired pursue,"
6609,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James would consider what was best to do;
6610,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"All spoke of Robert as a man they loved,"
6611,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And most of James as valued and approved.
6612,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Both had some learning: Robert his acquired
6613,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"By quicker parts, and was by praise inspired;      50"
6614,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James, as he was in his acquirements slow,"
6615,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Would learn the worth of what he tried to know.
6616,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In fact, this youth was generous—that was just;"
6617,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The one you loved, the other you would trust;"
6618,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Yet him you loved you would for truth approve,"
6619,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And him you trusted you would likewise love.
6620,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Such were the brothers—James had found his way      }
6621,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To Nether Hall, and there inclined to stay;      }"
6622,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He could himself command, and therefore could obey.      }"
6623,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He with the keeper took his daily round,      60"
6624,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"A rival grew, and some unkindness found;"
6625,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But his superior farm’d! the place was void,"
6626,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And James guns, dogs, and dignity enjoy’d."
6627,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Robert had scorn of service; he would be
6628,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"A slave to no man—happy were the free,"
6629,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And only they;—by such opinions led,"
6630,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Robert to sundry kinds of trade was bred.
6631,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Nor let us wonder if he sometimes made
6632,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,An active partner in a lawless trade;
6633,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Fond of adventure, wanton as the wave,      70"
6634,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He loved the danger and the law to brave;
6635,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But these were chance-adventures, known to few—"
6636,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Not that the hero cared what people knew.
6637,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The brothers met not often—When they met,"
6638,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James talk’d of honest gains and scorn of debt,"
6639,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Of virtuous labour, of a sober life,"
6640,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And what with credit would support a wife.
6641,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But Robert answer’d—“How can men advise
6642,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Who to a master let their tongue and eyes?
6643,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Whose words are not their own? whose foot and hand      80
6644,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Run at a nod, or act upon command?"
6645,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Who cannot eat or drink, discourse or play,"
6646,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Without requesting others that they may.
6647,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Debt you would shun; but what advice to give,"
6648,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Who owe your service every hour you live!
6649,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Let a bell sound, and from your friends you run,"
6650,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Although the darling of your heart were one;
6651,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But, if the bondage fits you, I resign"
6652,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,You to your lot—I am content with mine!”
6653,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Thus would the lads their sentiments express,      90"
6654,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And part in earnest, part in playfulness;"
6655,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Till Love, controller of all hearts and eyes,      }"
6656,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Breaker of bonds, of friendship’s holy ties,      }"
6657,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Awakener of new wills and slumbering sympathies,      }"
6658,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Began his reign—till Rachel, meek-eyed maid,"
6659,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"That form, those cheeks, that faultless face display’d—"
6660,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"That child of gracious nature, ever neat"
6661,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And never fine; a flowret simply sweet,"
6662,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Seeming at least unconscious she was fair;
6663,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Meek in her spirit, timid in her air,      100"
6664,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And shrinking from his glance if one presumed
6665,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,To come too near the beauty as it bloom’d.
6666,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Robert beheld her in her father’s cot
6667,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Day after day, and blest his happy lot;"
6668,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He look’d indeed, but he could not offend"
6669,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,By gentle looks—he was her father’s friend.
6670,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She was accustom’d to that tender look,"
6671,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And frankly gave the hand he fondly took;
6672,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She loved his stories, pleased she heard him play;      }"
6673,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Pensive herself, she loved to see him gay;      110}"
6674,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, if they loved not yet, they were in Love’s highway.      }"
6675,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But Rachel now to womanhood was grown,"
6676,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And would no more her faith and fondness own;
6677,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She called her latent prudence to her aid,"
6678,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And grew observant, cautious, and afraid;"
6679,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She heard relations of her lover’s guile,"
6680,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And could believe the danger of his smile.
6681,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,With art insidious rival damsels strove
6682,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To show how false his speech, how feign’d his love;"
6683,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, though her heart another story told,      120"
6684,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Her speech grew cautious, and her manner cold."
6685,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Rachel had village fame, was fair and tall,"
6686,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And gain’d a place of credit at the Hall;
6687,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Where James beheld her seated in that place,"
6688,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,With a child’s meekness and an angel’s face;
6689,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Her temper soft, her spirit firm, her words"
6690,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Simple and few as simple truth affords.
6691,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James could but love her—he at church had seen
6692,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The tall, fair maid; had met her on the green;"
6693,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Admiring always, nor surprised to find      130"
6694,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Her figure often present to his mind;
6695,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But now he saw her daily, and the sight"
6696,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Gave him new pleasure and increased delight.
6697,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But James, still prudent and reserved, though sure"
6698,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The love he felt was love that would endure,"
6699,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Would wait awhile, observing what was fit,"
6700,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And meet, and right, nor would himself commit."
6701,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Then was he flatter’d—James in time became
6702,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Rich, both as slayer of the Baron’s game,"
6703,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And as protector—not a female dwelt      140
6704,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,In that demesne who had not feign’d or felt
6705,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Regard for James; and he from all had praise
6706,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Enough a young man’s vanity to raise;
6707,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,With all these pleasures he of course must part
6708,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,When Rachel reign’d sole empress of his heart.
6709,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Robert was now deprived of that delight
6710,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He once experienced in his mistress’ sight;
6711,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For, though he now his frequent visits paid,"
6712,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He saw but little of the cautious maid;
6713,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The simple, common pleasures that he took      150"
6714,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Grew dull, and he the wonted haunts forsook;"
6715,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"His flute and song he left, his book and pen,"
6716,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And sought the meetings of adventurous men.
6717,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There was a love-born sadness in his breast,"
6718,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That wanted stimulus to bring on rest;
6719,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"These simple pleasures were no more of use,"
6720,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And danger only could repose produce;
6721,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He join’d th’ associates in their lawless trade,"
6722,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And was at length of their profession made.
6723,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He saw connected with th’ adventurous crew      160
6724,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Those whom he judged were sober men and true;
6725,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He found that some, who should the trade prevent,"
6726,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Gave it by purchase their encouragement;
6727,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He found that contracts could be made with those
6728,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Who had their pay these dealers to oppose;
6729,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And the good ladies whom at church he saw,"
6730,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"With looks devout, of reverence and awe,"
6731,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Could change their feelings as they change their place,"
6732,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, whispering, deal for spicery and lace:"
6733,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And thus the craft and avarice of these      170
6734,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Urged on the youth, and gave his conscience ease."
6735,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Him loved the maiden Rachel, fondly loved,"
6736,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"As many a sigh and tear in absence proved,"
6737,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And many a fear for dangers that she knew,"
6738,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And many a doubt what one so gay might do.
6739,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Of guilt she thought not—she had often heard
6740,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"They bought and sold, and nothing wrong appear’d;"
6741,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Her father’s maxim this; she understood
6742,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There was some ill—but he, she knew, was good;"
6743,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,It was a traffic—but was done by night—      180
6744,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"If wrong, how trade? why secrecy, if right?"
6745,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But Robert’s conscience, she believed, was pure—"
6746,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And that he read his Bible she was sure.
6747,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James, better taught, in confidence declared"
6748,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,His grief for what his guilty brother dared:
6749,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He sigh’d to think how near he was akin
6750,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,To one [seduced] by godless men to sin;
6751,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Who, being always of the law in dread,"
6752,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To other crimes were by the danger led,"
6753,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And crimes with like excuse——The smuggler cries,      190"
6754,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“What guilt is his who pays for what he buys?”
6755,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The poacher questions, with perverted mind,"
6756,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“Were not the gifts of heaven for all design’d?”
6757,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"_This_ cries, “I sin not—take not till I pay;”—"
6758,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"_That_, “My own hand brought down my proper prey.”—"
6759,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And while to such fond arguments they cling,"
6760,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,How fear they God? how honour they the king?
6761,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Such men associate, and each other aid,"
6762,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Till all are guilty, rash, and desperate made;"
6763,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Till to some lawless deed the wretches fly,      200"
6764,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And in the act or for the acting, die."
6765,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The maid was frighten’d—but, if this was true,"
6766,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Robert for certain no such danger knew;
6767,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He always pray’d ere he a trip begun,"
6768,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And was too happy for a wicked man.
6769,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"How could a creature, who was always gay,      }"
6770,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"So kind to all men, so disposed to pray,      }"
6771,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,How could he give his heart to such an evil way?      }
6772,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Yet she had fears—for she could not believe
6773,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"That James could lie, or purpose to deceive;      210"
6774,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But still she found, though not without respect"
6775,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For one so good, she must the man reject:"
6776,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For, simple though she was, full well she knew"
6777,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,What this strong friendship led him to pursue;
6778,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, let the man be honest as the light,"
6779,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Love warps the mind a little from the right;
6780,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And she proposed, against the trying day,"
6781,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,What in the trial she should think and say.
6782,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And now, their love avow’d, in both arose"
6783,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Fear and disdain—the orphan pair were foes.      220
6784,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Robert, more generous of the two, avow’d"
6785,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"His scorn, defiance, and contempt aloud."
6786,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James talk’d of pity in a softer tone,"
6787,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To Rachel speaking, and with her alone:"
6788,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“He knew full well,” he said, “to what must come"
6789,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"His wretched brother, what would be his doom.”"
6790,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Thus he her bosom fenced with dread about;
6791,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But love he could not with his skill drive out.
6792,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Still, he effected something—and that skill"
6793,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Made the love wretched, though it could not kill;      230"
6794,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And Robert fail’d, though much he tried, to prove"
6795,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He had no guilt—She granted he had love.
6796,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Thus they proceeded, till a winter came,"
6797,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,When the stern keeper told of stolen game.
6798,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Throughout the woods the poaching dogs had been;
6799,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And from him nothing should the robbers screen,"
6800,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"From him and law—he would all hazards run,"
6801,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Nor spare a poacher, were his brother one—"
6802,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Love, favour, interest, tie of blood should fail,"
6803,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Till vengeance bore him bleeding to the jail.      240
6804,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Poor Rachel shudder’d—smuggling she could name
6805,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Without confusion, for she felt not shame;"
6806,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But poachers were her terror, and a wood"
6807,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Which they frequented had been mark’d by blood;
6808,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, though she thought her Robert was secure"
6809,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In better thoughts, yet could she not be sure."
6810,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James now was urgent—it would break his heart
6811,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"With hope, with her, and with such views to part,"
6812,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"When one so wicked would her hand possess,"
6813,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And he a brother!—that was his distress,      250"
6814,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And must be hers——She heard him, and she sigh’d,"
6815,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Looking in doubt—but nothing she replied.
6816,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There was a generous feeling in her mind,"
6817,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That told her this was neither good nor kind.
6818,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James caused her terror, but he did no more—"
6819,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Her love was now as it had been before.
6820,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Their traffic fail’d—and the adventurous crew
6821,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,No more their profitless attempts renew.
6822,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Dig they will not, and beg they might in vain—"
6823,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Had they not pride, and what can then remain?      260"
6824,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Now was the game destroy’d, and not an hare"
6825,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Escaped at least the danger of the snare;
6826,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Woods of their feather’d beauty were bereft,"
6827,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The beauteous victims of the silent theft;
6828,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The well-known shops received a large supply,"
6829,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That they who could not kill at least might buy.
6830,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James was enraged, enraged his lord, and both"
6831,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Confirm’d their threatening with a vengeful oath;
6832,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Fresh aid was sought,—and nightly on the lands"
6833,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Walk’d on their watch the strong determined bands:      270
6834,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Pardon was offer’d, and a promised pay"
6835,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,To him who would the desperate gang betray.
6836,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Nor fail’d the measure—on a certain night
6837,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A few were seized—the rest escaped by flight;
6838,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Yet they resisted boldly ere they fled,"
6839,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And blows were dealt around, and blood was shed;"
6840,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Two groaning helpers on the earth were laid,"
6841,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,When more arrived the lawful cause to aid;
6842,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Then four determined men were seized and bound,"
6843,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And Robert in this desperate number found.      280
6844,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In prison fetter’d, he deplored his fate,"
6845,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And cursed the folly he perceived too late.
6846,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James was a favourite with his lord—the zeal
6847,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He show’d was such as masters ever feel;
6848,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"If he for vengeance on a culprit cried,"
6849,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Or if for mercy, still his lord complied;"
6850,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And now, ’twas said, he will for mercy plead,"
6851,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,For his own brother’s was the guilty deed;
6852,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"True, the hurt man is in a mending way,"
6853,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But must be crippled to his dying day.      290
6854,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Now James had vow’d the law should take its course,"
6855,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He would not stay it, if he did not force;"
6856,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He could his witness, if he pleased, withdraw,"
6857,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Or he could arm with certain death the law.
6858,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"This he attested to the maid; and true,"
6859,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"If this he could not, yet he much could do."
6860,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"How suffer’d then that maid—no thought she had,"
6861,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"No view of days to come, that was not sad:"
6862,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"As sad as life with all its hopes resign’d,"
6863,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,As sad as ought but guilt can make mankind.      300
6864,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,With bitter grief the pleasures she review’d      }
6865,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Of early hope, with innocence pursued,      }"
6866,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"When she began to love, and he was fond and good.      }"
6867,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He now must die, she heard from every tongue—"
6868,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Die, and so thoughtless! perish, and so young!"
6869,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Brave, kind, and generous, tender, constant, true,"
6870,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And he must die—then will I perish too!
6871,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A thousand acts in every age will prove
6872,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Women are valiant in a cause they love;
6873,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"If fate the favour’d swain in danger place,      310}"
6874,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,They heed not danger—perils they embrace;      }
6875,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"They dare the world’s contempt, they brave their name’s disgrace; }"
6876,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,They on the ocean meet its wild alarms;
6877,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,They search the dungeon with extended arms;
6878,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The utmost trial of their faith they prove,"
6879,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And yield the lover to assert their love.
6880,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James knew his power—his feelings were not nice—
6881,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Mercy he sold, and she must pay the price:"
6882,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"If his good lord forbore to urge their fate,"
6883,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And he the utmost of their guilt to state,      320"
6884,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The felons might their forfeit lives redeem.
6885,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And in their country’s cause regain esteem;
6886,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But never more that man, whom he had shame"
6887,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To call his brother, must she see or name."
6888,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Rachel was meek, but she had firmness too,"
6889,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And reason’d much on what she ought to do.
6890,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In Robert’s place, she knew what she should choose—"
6891,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But life was not the thing she fear’d to lose.
6892,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She knew that she could not their contract break,"
6893,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Nor for her life a new engagement make;      330
6894,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But he was man, and guilty—death so near"
6895,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Might not to his as to her mind appear;
6896,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And he might wish, to spare that forfeit life."
6897,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The maid he loved might be his brother’s wife,"
6898,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Although that brother was his bitter foe,"
6899,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And he must all the sweets of life forego.
6900,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"This would she try—intent on this alone,"
6901,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,She could assume a calm and settled tone;
6902,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She spake with firmness—“I will Robert see,"
6903,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Know what he wishes, and what I must be;”      340"
6904,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,For James had now discover’d to the maid
6905,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"His inmost heart, and how he must be paid,"
6906,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"If he his lord would soften, and would hide"
6907,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The facts that must the culprit’s fate decide.
6908,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Go not,” he said—for she her full intent"
6909,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Proclaime’d——To go she purposed, and she went;"
6910,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She took a guide, and went with purpose stern"
6911,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The secret wishes of her friend to learn.
6912,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She saw him fetter’d, full of grief, alone,"
6913,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Still as the dead, and he suppress’d a groan      350"
6914,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"At her appearance——Now she pray’d for strength,"
6915,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And the sad couple could converse at length.
6916,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,It was a scene that shook her to repeat—
6917,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Life fought with love, both powerful, and both sweet."
6918,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Wilt thou die, Robert, or preserve thy life?"
6919,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Shall I be thine own maid, or James’s wife?”—"
6920,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“His wife!—No!—Never will I thee resign—
6921,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"No, Rachel, no!”——“Then am I ever thine:"
6922,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,I know thee rash and guilty—but to thee
6923,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"I pledged my vow, and thine will ever be.      360"
6924,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Yet think again—the life that God has lent
6925,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Is thine, but not to cast away—Consent,"
6926,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,If ’tis thy wish; for this I made my way
6927,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To thy distress—Command, and I obey.”"
6928,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“Perhaps my brother may have gain’d thy heart?”—
6929,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Then why this visit, if I wish’d to part?"
6930,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Was it, ah, man ungrateful! wise to make"
6931,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Effort like this, to hazard for thy sake"
6932,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"A spotless reputation, and to be"
6933,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A suppliant to that stern man for thee?      370
6934,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But I forgive—thy spirit has been tried,"
6935,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And thou art weak; but still thou must decide.
6936,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“I ask’d thy brother, ‘James, would’st thou command,"
6937,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Without the loving heart, the obedient hand?’"
6938,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"I ask thee, Robert, lover, canst thou part"
6939,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"With this poor hand, when master of the heart?"
6940,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He answer’d, ‘Yes!’—I tarry thy reply,"
6941,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Resign’d with him to live, content with thee to die.”"
6942,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Assured of this, with spirits low and tame:"
6943,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Here, life so purchased—there, a death of shame;      380"
6944,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Death, once his merriment, but now his dread—"
6945,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And he with terror thought upon the dead:
6946,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“[Oh]! sure ’tis better to endure the care
6947,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And pain of life, than go we know not where!—"
6948,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And is there not the dreaded hell for sin,"
6949,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Or is it only this I feel within,"
6950,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"That, if it lasted, no man would sustain,"
6951,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But would by any change relieve the pain?
6952,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Forgive me, love! it is a loathsome thing      }"
6953,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,To live not thine; but still this dreaded sting      390}
6954,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Of death torments me—I to nature cling——      }
6955,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Go, and be his—but love him not, be sure—"
6956,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Go, love him not—and I will life endure:"
6957,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He, too, is mortal!”——Rachel deeply sigh’d,      }"
6958,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But would no more converse: she had complied,      }"
6959,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And was no longer free—she was his brother’s bride.      }
6960,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Farewell!” she said, with kindness, but not fond,"
6961,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Feeling the pressure of the recent bond,"
6962,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And put her tenderness apart to give
6963,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Advice to one who so desired to live.      400
6964,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She then departed, join’d the attending guide,"
6965,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Reflected—wept—was sad—was satisfied.
6966,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,James on her worth and virtue could depend—
6967,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He listen’d gladly to her story’s end;
6968,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Again he promised Robert’s life to save,"
6969,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And claim’d the hand that she in payment gave.
6970,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Robert, when death no longer was in view,"
6971,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Scorn’d what was done, but could not this undo."
6972,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The day appointed for the trial near
6973,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He view’d with shame, and not unmix’d with fear:—      410"
6974,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James might deceive him; and, if not, the schemes"
6975,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Of men may fail——“Can I depend on James?”
6976,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He might; for now the grievous price was paid—
6977,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James to the altar led the victim maid,"
6978,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And gave the trembling girl his faithful word
6979,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,For Robert’s safety; and so gave my lord.
6980,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But this, and all the promise hope could give,"
6981,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Gilded not life—it was not joy to live;
6982,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There was no smile in Rachel, nothing gay;"
6983,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The hours pass’d off, but never danced away.      420"
6984,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,When drew the gloomy day for trial near
6985,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,There came a note to Robert—“Banish fear!”
6986,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He knew whence safety came—his terror fled,"
6987,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But rage and vengeance fill’d his soul instead.
6988,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A stronger fear in his companions rose—
6989,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The day of trial on their hopes might close:
6990,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"They had no brothers, none to intercede"
6991,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For them, their friends suspected, and in need;"
6992,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Scatter’d, they judged, and could unite no more—"
6993,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Not so, they then were at the prison door.      430"
6994,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For some had met who sought the haunts they loved,"
6995,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And were to pity and to vengeance moved:
6996,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Their fellows perish! and they see their fall—
6997,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“Why not attempt the steep but guardless wall?”
6998,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Attempt was made, his part assign’d each man,"
6999,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And they succeeded in the desperate plan;
7000,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In truth, a purposed mercy smooth’d their way,"
7001,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But that they knew not—all triumphant they.
7002,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Safe in their well-known haunts, they all prepared"
7003,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To plan anew, and show how much they dared.      440"
7004,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"With joy the troubled heart of Robert beat,"
7005,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For life was his, and liberty was sweet;"
7006,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,He look’d around in freedom——in delight?
7007,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,O! no—his Rachel was another’s right!
7008,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“Right!—has he then preserved me in the day
7009,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Of my distress?—He has the lovely pay,"
7010,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But I no freedom at the [slave’s] request!
7011,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The price I paid shall then be repossess’d!
7012,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Alas! her virtue and the law prevent,"
7013,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Force cannot be, and she will not consent;      450"
7014,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But were that brother gone!—A brother?  No!
7015,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A circumventor!—and the wretch shall go!
7016,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Yet not this hand—How shifts about my mind,"
7017,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Ungovern’d, guideless, drifting in the wind;"
7018,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And I am all a tempest, whirl’d around"
7019,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"By dreadful thoughts, that fright me and confound!—"
7020,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,I would I saw him on the earth laid low!
7021,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"I wish the fate, but must not give the blow!”"
7022,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,So thinks a man when thoughtful; he prefers
7023,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A life of peace till man his anger stirs;      460
7024,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Then all the efforts of his reason cease,"
7025,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And he forgets how pleasant was that peace;
7026,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Till the wild passions what they seek obtain,"
7027,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And then he sinks into his calm again.
7028,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Now met the lawless clan—in secret met,"
7029,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And down at their convivial board were set;
7030,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The plans in view to past adventures led,      }"
7031,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And the past conflicts present anger bred;      }
7032,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"They sigh’d for pleasures gone, they groan’d for heroes dead;      }"
7033,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Their ancient stores were rifled—strong desires      470
7034,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Awaked, and wine rekindled latent fires."
7035,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,It was a night such bold desires to move:
7036,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Strong winds and wintry torrents fill’d the grove;
7037,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The crackling boughs that in the forest fell,"
7038,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The cawing rooks, the cur’s affrighten’d yell,"
7039,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The scenes above the wood, the floods below,      }"
7040,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Were mix’d, and none the single sound could know;      }"
7041,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Loud blow the blasts,” they cried, “and call us as they blow. }"
7042,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“In such a night”—and then the heroes told
7043,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,What had been done in better times of old:      480
7044,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"How they had conquer’d all opposed to them,"
7045,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"By force in part, in part by stratagem;"
7046,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And, as the tales inflamed the fiery crew,"
7047,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,What had been done they then prepared to do;
7048,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“’Tis a last night!” they said—the angry blast
7049,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And roaring floods seem’d answering, “’tis a last!”"
7050,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James knew they met, for he had spies about,"
7051,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Grave, sober men, whom none presumed to doubt;"
7052,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For, if suspected, they had soon been tried"
7053,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Where fears are evidence, and doubts decide.      490"
7054,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But these escaped——Now James companions took,"
7055,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Sturdy and bold, with terror-stirring look;"
7056,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He had before, by informations led,"
7057,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Left the afflicted partner of his bed;
7058,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Awaked his men, and through plantations wide,"
7059,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Deep woods, and trackless ling, had been their guide;"
7060,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And then return’d to wake the pitying wife,"
7061,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And hear her tender terrors for his life.
7062,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But in this night a sure informer came:
7063,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“They were assembled who attack’d his game;      500
7064,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Who more than once had through the park made way,"
7065,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And slain the dappled breed, or vow’d to slay;”"
7066,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The trembling spy had heard the solemn vow,"
7067,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And need and vengeance both inspired them now.
7068,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The keeper early had retired to rest
7069,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,For brief repose;—sad thoughts his mind possess’d;
7070,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In his short sleep he started from his bed,"
7071,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And ask’d in fancy’s terror “Is he dead?”
7072,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There was a call below, when James awoke,"
7073,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Rose from his bed, and arms to aid him took,      510"
7074,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Not all defensive!—there his helpers stood,"
7075,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Arm’d like himself, and hastening to the wood."
7076,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Why this?” he said, for Rachel pour’d her tears"
7077,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Profuse, that spoke involuntary fears:"
7078,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Sleep, that so early thou for us may’st wake,"
7079,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And we our comforts in return may take;
7080,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Sleep, and farewell!” he said, and took his way,"
7081,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And the sad wife in neither could obey.
7082,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She slept not nor well fared, but restless dwelt"
7083,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"On her past life, and past afflictions felt;      520"
7084,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The man she loved the brother and the foe
7085,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Of him she married!—It had wrought her woe:
7086,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Not that she loved, but pitied, and that now"
7087,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Was, so she fear’d, infringement of her vow."
7088,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"James too was civil, though she must confess"
7089,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That his was not her kind of happiness;
7090,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That he would shoot the man who shot a hare
7091,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Was what her timid conscience could not bear;
7092,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But still she loved him—wonder’d where he stray’d
7093,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,In this loud night! and if he were afraid.      530
7094,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"More than one hour she thought, and, dropping then,"
7095,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"In sudden sleep, cried loudly “Spare him, men!"
7096,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And do no murder!”—then, awaked, she rose,"
7097,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And thought no more of trying for repose.
7098,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,’Twas past the dead of night; when every sound
7099,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That nature mingles might be heard around;
7100,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But none from man—man’s feeble voice was hush’d,"
7101,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Where rivers swelling roar’d, and woods were crush’d;"
7102,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Hurried by these, the wife could sit no more,"
7103,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,But must the terrors of the night explore.      540
7104,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Softly she left her door, her garden gate,"
7105,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And seem’d as then committed to her fate;
7106,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To every horrid thought and doubt a prey,"
7107,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She hurried on, already lost her way;"
7108,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Oft as she glided on in that sad night,"
7109,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She stopp’d to listen, and she look’d for light."
7110,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"An hour she wander’d, and was still to learn"
7111,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Aught of her husband’s safety or return:
7112,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A sudden break of heavy clouds could show
7113,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"A place she knew not, but she strove to know.      550"
7114,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Still further on she crept with trembling feet,"
7115,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"With hope a friend, with fear a foe, to meet;"
7116,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And there was something fearful in the sight,"
7117,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And in the sound of what appear’d to-night;
7118,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"For now, of night and nervous terror bred,"
7119,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Arose a strong and superstitious dread;
7120,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She heard strange noises, and the shapes she saw"
7121,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Of fancied beings bound her soul in awe.
7122,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The moon was risen, and she sometimes shone"
7123,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Through thick white clouds, that flew tumultuous on,      560"
7124,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Passing beneath her with an eagle’s speed,"
7125,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That her soft light imprisoned and then freed;
7126,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The fitful glimmering through the hedge-row green
7127,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Gave a strange beauty to the changing scene;
7128,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And roaring winds and rushing waters lent
7129,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Their mingled voice that to the spirit went.
7130,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"To these she listen’d; but new sounds were heard,"
7131,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And sight more startling to her soul appear’d;
7132,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There were low, lengthen’d tones with sobs between,"
7133,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And near at hand, but nothing yet was seen;      570"
7134,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"She hurried on, and “Who is there?” she cried;"
7135,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,“A dying wretch!”—was from the earth replied.
7136,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"It was her lover, was the man she gave—"
7137,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The price she paid, himself from death to save—"
7138,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"With whom, expiring, she must kneel and pray,      }"
7139,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,While the soul flitted from the shivering clay      }
7140,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"That press’d the dewy ground, and bled its life away!      }"
7141,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"This was the part that duty bad her take,"
7142,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Instant and ere her feelings were awake;
7143,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But now they waked to anguish; there came then,      580"
7144,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Hurrying with lights, loud-speaking, eager men."
7145,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“And here, my lord, we met—And who is here?"
7146,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The keeper’s wife—Ah! woman, go not near!"
7147,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,There lies the man that was the head of all—
7148,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"See, in his temples went the fatal ball!"
7149,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And James that instant, who was then our guide,"
7150,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Felt in his heart the adverse shot, and died!"
7151,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"It was a sudden meeting, and the light"
7152,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Of a dull moon made indistinct our fight;
7153,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"He foremost fell!—But see, the woman creeps      590"
7154,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Like a lost thing, that wanders as she sleeps."
7155,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"See here, her husband’s body—but she knows"
7156,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That other dead! and that her action shows.
7157,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Rachel! why look you at your mortal foe?—
7158,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,She does not hear us—Whither will she go?”
7159,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Now, more attentive, on the dead they gazed,"
7160,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And they were brothers: sorrowing and amazed,"
7161,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"On all a momentary silence came,"
7162,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"A common softness, and a moral shame."
7163,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"“Seized you the poachers?” said my lord—“They fled,      600"
7164,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And we pursued not—one of them was dead,"
7165,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And one of us; they hurried through the wood,"
7166,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Two lives were gone, and we no more pursued."
7167,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Two lives of men, of valiant brothers lost!"
7168,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Enough, my lord, do hares and pheasants cost!”"
7169,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"So many thought, and there is found a heart"
7170,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,To dwell upon the deaths on either part;
7171,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Since this their morals have been more correct,"
7172,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,The cruel spirit in the place is check’d;
7173,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"His lordship holds not in such sacred care,      610"
7174,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Nor takes such dreadful vengeance for a hare;
7175,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"The smugglers fear, the poacher stands in awe"
7176,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Of Heaven’s own act, and reverences the law;"
7177,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"There was, there is a terror in the place"
7178,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,That operates on man’s offending race;
7179,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Such acts will stamp their moral on the soul,"
7180,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And while the bad they threaten and control,"
7181,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Will to the pious and the humble say,      }"
7182,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Yours is the right, the safe, the certain way,      }"
7183,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"’Tis wisdom to be good, ’tis virtue to obey.      620}"
7184,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"So Rachel thinks, the pure, the good, the meek,"
7185,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Whose outward acts the inward purpose speak.
7186,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"As men will children at their sports behold,"
7187,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"And smile to see them, though unmoved and cold;"
7188,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Smile at the recollected games, and then"
7189,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,Depart and mix in the affairs of men:
7190,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"So Rachel looks upon the world, and sees"
7191,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"It cannot longer pain her, longer please,"
7192,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"But just detain the passing thought, or cause"
7193,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,A gentle smile of pity or applause;      630
7194,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,And then the recollected soul repairs
7195,_SMUGGLERS AND POACHERS._,"Her slumbering hope, and heeds her own affairs."

7236,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And bid farewell! for he must go away.
7237,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He sought the Rector first, not lately seen,"
7238,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,For he had absent from his parish been;
7239,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Farewell!” the younger man with feeling cried,      20"
7240,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Farewell!” the cold but worthy priest replied;
7241,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“When do you leave us?”—“I have days but two.”—
7242,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“’Tis a short time—but, well—Adieu, adieu!”"
7243,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Now here is one,” said Richard, as he went"

7247,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Whose love professed, I question’d not, was true—"
7248,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And now to hear his heartless, ‘Well! adieu!’"
7249,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“But ’tis not well—and he a man of sense,      30"
7250,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Grave, but yet looking strong benevolence;"
7251,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Whose slight acerbity and roughness told
7252,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To his advantage; yet the man is cold;
7253,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Nor will he know, when rising in the morn,"
7254,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That such a being to the world was born.
7255,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Are such the friendships we contract in life?
7256,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,O! give me then the friendship of a wife!
7257,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Adieus, nay, parting-pains to us are sweet:"
7258,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,They make so glad the moments when we meet.
7259,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“For, though we look not for regard intense      40"
7260,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Or warm professions in a man of sense,"
7261,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Yet in the daily intercourse of mind
7262,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I thought that found which I desired to find,"
7263,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Feeling and frankness—thus it seem’d to me,"
7264,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And such farewell!—Well, Rector, let it be!”"
7265,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Of the fair sisters then he took his leave,"
7266,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Forget he could not, he must think and grieve;"
7267,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Must the impression of their wrongs retain,"
7268,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Their very patience adding to his pain;
7269,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And still, the better they their sorrows bore,      50"
7270,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,His friendly nature made him feel them more.
7271,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He judged they must have many a heavy hour
7272,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,When the mind suffers from a want of power;
7273,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"When, troubled long, we find our strength decay’d,"
7274,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And cannot then recal our better aid;
7275,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"For to the mind ere yet that aid has flown,"
7276,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Grief has possess’d, and made it all his own;"
7277,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And patience suffers, till, with gather’d might,"
7278,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,The scatter’d forces of the soul unite.
7279,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But few and short such times of suffering were      60
7280,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"In Lucy’s mind, and brief the reign of care."
7281,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Jane had, indeed, her flights, but had in them"
7282,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"What we could pity, but must not condemn;"
7283,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"For they were always pure and oft sublime,"
7284,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And such as triumph’d over earth and time:
7285,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Thoughts of eternal love that souls possess,"
7286,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Foretaste divine of Heaven’s own happiness.
7287,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Oft had he seen them, and esteem had sprung"
7288,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"In his free mind for maids so sad and young,"
7289,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"So good and grieving, and his place was high      70"
7290,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"In their esteem, his friendly brother’s nigh,"
7291,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But yet beneath; and when he said adieu!
7292,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Their tone was kind, and was responsive too."
7293,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Parting was painful; when adieu he cried,"
7294,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“You will return?” the gentle girls replied;
7295,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“You must return! your Brother knows you now,"
7296,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But to exist without you knows not how;
7297,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Has he not told us of the lively joy
7298,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He takes—forgive us—in the Brother-boy?
7299,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He is alone and pensive; you can give      80
7300,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Pleasure to one by whom a number live
7301,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"In daily comfort—sure for this you met,"
7302,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That for his debtors you might pay a debt—
7303,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"The poor are call’d ungrateful, but you still"
7304,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Will have their thanks for this—indeed you will.”
7305,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Richard but little said, for he of late"
7306,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Held with himself contention and debate.
7307,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“My Brother loves me, his regard I know,"
7308,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But will not such affection weary grow?
7309,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He kindly says, ‘defer the parting day,’      90"
7310,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But yet may wish me in his heart away;
7311,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Nothing but kindness I in him perceive,"
7312,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,In me ’tis kindness then to take my leave.
7313,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Why should I grieve if he should weary be?
7314,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,There have been visitors who wearied me;
7315,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He yet may love, and we may part in peace,"
7316,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Nay, in affection—novelty must cease—"
7317,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Man is but man; the thing he most desires
7318,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Pleases awhile—then pleases not—then tires;
7319,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,George to his former habits and his friends      100
7320,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Will now return, and so my visit ends.”"
7321,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thus Richard communed with his heart; but still
7322,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He found opposed his reason and his will;
7323,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Found that his thoughts were busy in this train,"
7324,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And he was striving to be calm in vain.
7325,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"These thoughts were passing, while he yet forbore"
7326,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To leave the friends whom he might see no more.
7327,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Then came a chubby child and sought relief,"
7328,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Sobbing in all the impotence of grief;
7329,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"A full-fed girl she was, with ruddy cheek,      110"
7330,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And features coarse, that grosser feelings speak,"
7331,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"To whom another miss, with passions strong,"
7332,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And slender fist, had done some baby-wrong."
7333,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,On Lucy’s gentle mind had Barlow wrought
7334,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"To teach this child, whom she had labouring taught"
7335,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,With unpaid love—this unproductive brain
7336,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Would little comprehend, and less retain."
7337,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"A farmer’s daughter, with redundant health,"
7338,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And double Lucy’s weight and Lucy’s wealth,"
7339,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Had won the man’s regard, and he with her      120"
7340,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Possess’d the treasure vulgar minds prefer.
7341,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"A man of thrift, and thriving, he possess’d"
7342,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,What he esteem’d of earthly good the best;
7343,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And Lucy’s well-stored mind had not a charm
7344,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"For this true lover of the well-stock’d farm,"
7345,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"This slave to petty wealth and rustic toil,"
7346,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,This earth-devoted wooer of the soil.—
7347,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But she with meekness took the wayward child,"
7348,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And sought to make the savage nature mild.
7349,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But Jane her judgment with decision gave—      130
7350,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Train not an idiot to oblige a slave.”
7351,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“And where is Bloomer?” Richard would have said,"
7352,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But he was cautious, feeling, and afraid;"
7353,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And little either of the hero knew,"
7354,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And little sought—he might be married too.
7355,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Now to his home, the morning visits past,"
7356,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Return’d the guest—that evening was his last.
7357,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He met his Brother, and they spoke of those"
7358,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,From whom his comforts in the village rose;
7359,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Spoke of the favourites, whom so good and kind      140"
7360,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,It was peculiar happiness to find;
7361,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Then for the sisters in their griefs they felt,"
7362,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And, sad themselves, on saddening subjects dwelt."
7363,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But George was willing all this woe to spare,"
7364,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And let to-morrow be to-morrow’s care.
7365,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He of his purchase talk’d—a thing of course,"
7366,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,As men will boldly praise a new-bought horse.
7367,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Richard was not to all its beauty blind,"
7368,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And promised still to seek, with hope to find:"
7369,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,The price indeed——”
7370,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Yes, that,” said George, “is high;      150"
7371,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But, if I bought not, one was sure to buy,"
7372,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Who might the social comforts we enjoy,"
7373,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And every comfort, lessen or destroy."
7374,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“We must not always reckon what we give,"
7375,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But think how precious ’tis in peace to live;
7376,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Some neighbour Nimrod might in very pride
7377,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Have stirr’d my anger, and have then defied;"
7378,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Or worse, have loved, and teased me to excess"
7379,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,By his kind care to give me happiness;
7380,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Or might his lady and her daughters bring      160
7381,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"To raise my spirits, to converse, and sing."
7382,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"’Twas not the benefit alone I view’d,"
7383,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But thought what horrid things I might exclude.
7384,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Some party man might here have sat him down,"
7385,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Some country champion, railing at the crown;"
7386,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Or some true courtier, both prepared to prove,"
7387,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Who loved not them, could not their country love:"
7388,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"If we have value for our health and ease,"
7389,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Should we not buy off enemies like these?”
7390,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"So pass’d the evening in a quiet way,      170"
7391,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"When, lo! the morning of the parting day."
7392,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Each to the table went with clouded look,"
7393,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And George in silence gazed upon a book;
7394,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Something that chance had offer’d to his view—
7395,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He knew not what, or cared not, if he knew."
7396,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Richard his hand upon a paper laid—
7397,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,His vacant eye upon the carpet stray’d;
7398,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"His tongue was talking something of the day,"
7399,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And his vex’d mind was wandering on his way.
7400,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,They spake by fits—but neither had concern      180
7401,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"In the replies—they nothing wish’d to learn,"
7402,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Nor to relate; each sat as one who tries
7403,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To baffle sadnesses and sympathies.
7404,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Each of his Brother took a steady view—
7405,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"As actor he, and as observer too."
7406,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Richard, whose heart was ever free and frank,"
7407,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Had now a trial, and before it sank:"
7408,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He thought his Brother—parting now so near—
7409,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Appear’d not as his Brother should appear;
7410,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He could as much of tenderness remark      190
7411,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,When parting for a ramble in the park.
7412,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Yet, is it just?” he thought; “and would I see"
7413,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,My Brother wretched but to part with me?
7414,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,What can he further in my mind explore?
7415,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He saw enough, and he would see no more."
7416,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Happy himself, he wishes now to slide      }"
7417,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Back to his habits——He is satisfied;      }
7418,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But I am not—this cannot be denied.      }
7419,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“He has been kind—so let me think him still;
7420,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Yet he expresses not a wish, a will      200"
7421,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To meet again!”——And thus affection strove
7422,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"With pride, and petulance made war on love."
7423,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He thought his Brother cool—he knew him kind—
7424,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And there was sore division in his mind.
7425,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Hours yet remain—’tis misery to sit
7426,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,With minds for conversation all unfit;
7427,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"No evil can from change of place arise,"
7428,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And good will spring from air and exercise:
7429,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Suppose I take the purposed ride with you,"
7430,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And guide your jaded praise to objects new,      210"
7431,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That buyers see?”——
7432,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And Richard gave assent      }
7433,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Without resistance, and without intent;      }"
7434,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,He liked not nor declined—and forth the Brothers went.      }
7435,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Come, my dear Richard! let us cast away      }"
7436,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"All evil thoughts—let us forget the day,      }"
7437,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And fight like men with grief till we like boys are gay.”      }
7438,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thus George—and even this in Richard’s mind
7439,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Was judged an effort rather wise than kind;
7440,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"This flow’d from something he observed of late,"
7441,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And he could feel it, but he could not state;      220"
7442,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He thought some change appear’d—yet fail’d to prove,"
7443,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Even as he tried, abatement in the love;"
7444,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But in his Brother’s manner was restraint
7445,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"That he could feel, and yet he could not paint."
7446,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"That they should part in peace full well he knew,"
7447,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But much he fear’d to part with coolness too.
7448,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"George had been peevish when the subject rose,"
7449,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And never fail’d the parting to oppose;
7450,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Name it, and straight his features cloudy grew"
7451,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To stop the journey as the clouds will do;—      230
7452,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And thus they rode along in pensive mood,"
7453,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Their thoughts pursuing, by their cares pursued."
7454,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Richard,” said George, “I see it is in vain"
7455,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,By love or prayer my Brother to retain;
7456,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And, truth to tell, it was a foolish thing"
7457,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,A man like thee from thy repose to bring
7458,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Ours to disturb——Say, how am I to live"
7459,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Without the comforts thou art wont to give?
7460,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,How will the heavy hours my mind afflict—
7461,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"No one t’ agree, no one to contradict;      240"
7462,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"None to awake, excite me, or prevent;"
7463,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"To hear a tale, or hold an argument;"
7464,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"To help my worship in a case of doubt,"
7465,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And bring me in my blunders fairly out.
7466,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Who now by manners lively or serene
7467,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Comes between me and sorrow like a screen,"
7468,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And giving, what I look’d not to have found,"
7469,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"A care, an interest in the world around?”"
7470,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Silent was Richard, striving to adjust"
7471,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"His thoughts for speech—for speak, he thought, he must.      250"
7472,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Something like war within his bosom strove—
7473,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"His mild, kind nature, and his proud self-love;"
7474,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Grateful he was, and with his courage meek—"
7475,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But he was hurt, and he resolved to speak."
7476,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Yes, my dear Brother! from my soul I grieve"
7477,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thee and the proofs of thy regard to leave.
7478,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thou hast been all that I could wish—my pride
7479,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Exults to find that I am thus allied;
7480,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Yet, to express a feeling—how it came,"
7481,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"The pain it gives, its nature and its name,      260"
7482,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I know not—but of late, I will confess,"
7483,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Not that thy love is little, but is less."
7484,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Hadst thou received me in thy present mood,"
7485,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Sure I had held thee to be kind and good;
7486,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But thou wert all the warmest heart could state,"
7487,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Affection dream, or hope anticipate;"
7488,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,I must have wearied thee yet day by day—
7489,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"‘Stay!’ said my Brother, and ’twas good to stay;"
7490,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But now, forgive me, thinking I perceive"
7491,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Change undefined, and as I think I grieve.      270"
7492,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Have I offended?—Proud although I be,"
7493,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I will be humble, and concede to thee."
7494,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Have I intruded on thee when thy mind
7495,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Was vex’d, and then to solitude inclined?"
7496,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,O! there are times when all things will molest
7497,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Minds so disposed, so heavy, so oppress’d;"
7498,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And thine, I know, is delicate and nice,"
7499,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Sickening at folly, and at war with vice:"
7500,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Then, at a time when thou wert vex’d with these,"
7501,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I have intruded, let affection tease,      280"
7502,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And so offended.”——
7503,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Richard, if thou hast,"
7504,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"’Tis at this instant, nothing in the past."
7505,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"No, thou art all a Brother’s love would choose;"
7506,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And, having lost thee, I shall interest lose"
7507,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,In all that I possess; I pray thee tell
7508,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Wherein thy host has fail’d to please thee well—
7509,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Do I neglect thy comforts?”—
7510,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“O! not thou,"
7511,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But art thyself uncomfortable now;
7512,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And ’tis from thee and from thy looks I gain
7513,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,This painful knowledge—’tis my Brother’s pain;      290
7514,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And yet, that something in my spirit lives,"
7515,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Something that spleen excites and sorrow gives,"
7516,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,I may confess—for not in thee I trace
7517,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Alone this change, it is in all the place."
7518,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Smile if thou wilt in scorn, for I am glad"
7519,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,A smile at any rate is to be had.
7520,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“But there is Jacques, who ever seem’d to treat"
7521,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thy Brother kindly as we chanced to meet;
7522,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Nor with thee only pleased our worthy guide,"
7523,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But, in the hedge-row path and green-wood side,      300"
7524,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,There he would speak with that familiar ease
7525,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"That makes a trifle, makes a nothing please."
7526,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“But now to my farewell—and that I spoke
7527,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"With honest sorrow—with a careless look,"
7528,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Gazing unalter’d on some stupid prose—
7529,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,His sermon for the Sunday I suppose—
7530,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,‘Going?’ said he: ‘why then the ’Squire and you
7531,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Will part at last—You’re going?—Well, adieu!’"
7532,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“True, we were not in friendship bound like those"
7533,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Who will adopt each other’s friends and foes,      310"
7534,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Without esteem or hatred of their own—
7535,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But still we were to intimacy grown;
7536,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And, sure, of Jacques when I had taken leave"
7537,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,It would have grieved me—and it ought to grieve;
7538,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But I in him could not affection trace—      }
7539,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Careless he put his sermons in their place,      }"
7540,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,With no more feeling than his sermon-case.      }
7541,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Not so those generous girls beyond the brook—
7542,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,It quite unmann’d me as my leave I took.
7543,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“But, my dear Brother! when I take at night,      320"
7544,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"In my own home and in their mother’s sight,"
7545,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"By turns my children, or together see"
7546,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,A pair contending for the vacant knee;
7547,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,When to Matilda I begin to tell
7548,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,What in my visit first and last befell—
7549,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Of this your village, of her tower and spire,"
7550,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And, above all, her Rector and her ‘Squire,"
7551,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,How will the tale be marr’d when I shall end—
7552,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,I left displeased the Brother and the friend?”
7553,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Nay, Jacques is honest—Marry, he was then      330"
7554,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Engaged—What! part an author and his pen?
7555,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Just in the fit, and when th’ inspiring ray"
7556,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Shot on his brain, t’ arrest it in its way!"
7557,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Come, thou shalt see him in an easier vein,"
7558,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Nor of his looks nor of his words complain;
7559,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Art thou content?”—
7560,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"If Richard had replied,"
7561,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“I am,” his manner had his words belied."
7562,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Even from his Brother’s cheerfulness he drew
7563,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Something to vex him—what, he scarcely knew;"
7564,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"So he evading said, “My evil fate      340"
7565,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Upon my comforts throws a gloom of late:
7566,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Matilda writes not; and, when last she wrote,"
7567,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,I read no letter—’twas a trader’s note—
7568,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"‘Yours I received,’ and all that formal prate"
7569,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"That is so hateful, that she knows I hate."
7570,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Dejection reigns, I feel, but cannot tell"
7571,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Why upon me the dire infection fell.
7572,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Madmen may say that they alone are sane,"
7573,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And all beside have a distemper’d brain;
7574,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Something like this I feel—and I include      350
7575,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Myself among the frantic multitude;
7576,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But, come, Matilda writes, although but ill,"
7577,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And home has health, and that is comfort still.”"
7578,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"George stopt his horse, and with the kindest look"
7579,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Spoke to his Brother—earnestly he spoke,"
7580,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,As one who to his friend his heart reveals.
7581,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And all the hazard with the comfort feels.
7582,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Soon as I loved thee, Richard—and I loved"
7583,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Before my reason had the will approved,"
7584,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Who yet right early had her sanction lent,      360"
7585,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And with affection in her verdict went—
7586,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"So soon I felt, that thus a friend to gain,"
7587,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And then to lose, is but to purchase pain."
7588,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Daily the pleasure grew, then sad the day"
7589,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That takes it all in its increase away!
7590,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Patient thou wert, and kind—but well I knew      }"
7591,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"The husband’s wishes, and the father’s too;      }"
7592,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I saw how check’d they were, and yet in secret grew.      }"
7593,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Once and again, I urged thee to delay"
7594,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Thy purposed journey, still deferr’d the day;      370"
7595,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And still on its approach the pain increased
7596,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Till my request and thy compliance ceased.
7597,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I could not further thy affection task,"
7598,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Nor more of one so self-resisting ask;
7599,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But yet to lose thee, Richard, and with thee"
7600,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,All hope of social joys—it cannot be.
7601,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Nor could I bear to meet thee, as a boy      }"
7602,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"From school his parents, to obtain a joy,      }"
7603,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"That lessens day by day, and one will soon destroy.      }"
7604,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“No! I would have thee, Brother, all my own,      380"
7605,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To grow beside me as my trees have grown:
7606,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"For ever near me, pleasant in my sight,"
7607,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And, in my mind, my pride and my delight."
7608,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Yet will I tell thee, Richard: had I found"
7609,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thy mind dependent and thy heart unsound;
7610,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Hadst thou been poor, obsequious, and disposed"
7611,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,With any wish or measure to have closed;

7613,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"The younger brother, the convenient friend:"
7614,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thy speculation its reward had made      390
7615,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Like other ventures—thou hadst gain’d in trade.
7616,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"What reason urged, or Jacques esteem’d thy due,"
7617,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Thine had it been, and I, a trader too,"
7618,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Had paid my debt, and home my Brother sent,"
7619,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Nor glad nor sorry that he came or went;
7620,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Who to his wife and children would have told,"
7621,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"They had an uncle, and the man was old;"
7622,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Till every girl and boy had learn’d to prate
7623,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Of uncle George, his gout, and his estate."
7624,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Thus had we parted; but as now thou art,      400"
7625,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,I must not lose thee—No! I cannot part;

7628,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"All social ease and comfort to forego,"
7629,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And live again the solitary? No!
7630,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“We part no more, dear Richard! thou wilt need"
7631,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Thy Brother’s help to teach thy boys to read;
7632,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And I should love to hear Matilda’s psalm,"
7633,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"To keep my spirit in a morning calm,"

7636,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Then thou and I, an independent two,"
7637,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"May have our parties, and defend them too;"
7638,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Thy liberal notions, and my loyal fears,"

7640,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"We will for truth alone contend and read,"
7641,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And our good Jacques shall oversee our creed.
7642,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Such were my views; and I had quickly made
7643,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Some bold attempts my Brother to persuade
7644,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To think as I did; but I knew too well      420
7645,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Whose now thou wert, with whom thou wert to dwell;"
7646,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And why, I said, return him doubtful home,"

7651,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Dallying ’twixt will and will-not many a day,      }"
7652,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And fret the gloss of hope, and hope itself, away.      }"
7653,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Jacques is my friend; to him I gave my heart:
7654,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"‘You see my Brother, see I would not part;      430"
7655,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Wilt thou an embassy of love disdain?
7656,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Go to this sister, and my views explain;"
7657,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Gloss o’er my failings; paint me with a grace
7658,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That Love beholds; put meaning in my face;
7659,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Describe that dwelling; talk how well we live,"
7660,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And all its glory to our village give;
7661,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Praise the kind sisters whom we love so much,"
7662,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And thine own virtues like an artist touch.
7663,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“‘Tell her, and here my secret purpose show,"
7664,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That no dependence shall my sister know;      440
7665,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Hers all the freedom that she loves shall be,"
7666,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And mine the debt—then press her to agree;
7667,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Say, that my Brother’s wishes wait on hers,"
7668,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And his affection what she wills prefers.’
7669,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Forgive me, Brother—these my words and more"
7670,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Our friendly Rector to Matilda bore;
7671,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"At large, at length, were all my views explain’d,"
7672,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And to my joy my wishes I obtain’d.
7673,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Dwell in that house, and we shall still be near,"
7674,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Absence and parting I no more shall fear;      450
7675,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Dwell in thy home, and at thy will exclude"
7676,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,All who shall dare upon thee to intrude.
7677,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“Again thy pardon—’twas not my design
7678,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To give surprise; a better view was mine;
7679,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,But let it pass—and yet I wish’d to see
7680,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That meeting too; and happy may it be!”
7681,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Thus George had spoken, and then look’d around,"
7682,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And smiled as one who then his road had found;
7683,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Follow!” he cried, and briskly urged his horse."
7684,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Richard was puzzled, but obey’d of course;      460"
7685,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"He was affected like a man astray,"
7686,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Lost, but yet knowing something of the way;"
7687,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Till, a wood clear’d, that still conceal’d the view,"
7688,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Richard the purchase of his Brother knew;
7689,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And something flash’d upon his mind not clear,"
7690,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But much with pleasure mix’d, in part with fear."
7691,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"As one who, wandering through a stormy night,"
7692,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Sees his own home, and gladdens at the sight,"
7693,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Yet feels some doubt if fortune had decreed
7694,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That lively pleasure in such time of need:      470
7695,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,So Richard felt—but now the mansion came
7696,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,In view direct—he knew it for the same;
7697,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"There too the garden walk, the elms design’d"
7698,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To guard the peaches from the eastern wind;
7699,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And there the sloping glass, that when he shines"
7700,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Gives the sun’s vigour to the ripening vines.—
7701,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,“It is my Brother’s!”—
7702,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“No!” he answers, “No!"
7703,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,’Tis to thy own possession that we go;
7704,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"It is thy wife’s, and will thy children’s be,"
7705,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Earth, wood, and water!—all for thine and thee;      480"
7706,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Bought in thy name—Alight, my friend, and come,"
7707,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"I do beseech thee, to thy proper home;"
7708,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,There wilt thou soon thy own Matilda view;
7709,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"She knows our deed, and she approves it too;"
7710,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Before her all our views and plans were laid,"
7711,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And Jacques was there t’ explain and to persuade.
7712,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Here, on this lawn, thy boys and girls shall run,"
7713,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And play their gambols when their tasks are done;
7714,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"There, from that window, shall their mother view"
7715,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"The happy tribe, and smile at all they do;      490"
7716,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"While thou, more gravely, hiding thy delight,"
7717,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Shalt cry ‘O! childish!’ and enjoy the sight.
7718,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"“Well, my dear Richard, there’s no more to say—"
7719,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Stay, as you will—do any thing—but stay;"
7720,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Be, I dispute not, steward—what you will,"
7721,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Take your own name, but be my Brother still."
7722,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"And hear me, Richard! if I should offend,"
7723,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Assume the patron, and forget the friend;"
7724,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,If aught in word or manner I express
7725,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,That only touches on thy happiness;      500
7726,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"If I be peevish, humorsome, unkind,"
7727,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Spoil’d as I am by each subservient mind;
7728,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,For I am humour’d by a tribe who make
7729,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Me more capricious for the pains they take
7730,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,To make me quiet; shouldst thou ever feel
7731,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"A wound from this, this leave not time to heal,"
7732,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But let thy wife her cheerful smile withhold,"
7733,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Let her be civil, distant, cautious, cold;"
7734,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Then shall I woo forgiveness, and repent,"
7735,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,Nor bear to lose the blessings Heaven has lent.”      510
7736,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"But this was needless—there was joy of heart,"
7737,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,All felt the good that all desired t’ impart;
7738,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Respect, affection, and esteem combined,"
7739,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,In sundry portions ruled in every mind;
7740,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And o’er the whole an unobtrusive air
7741,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,"Of pious joy, that urged the silent prayer,"
7742,_THE VISIT CONCLUDED._,And bless’d the new-born feelings——Here we close

8392,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",And sorely frighten’d—can you let me out?”—
8393,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","“Oh! yes, my child; it was indeed a sin,"
8394,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","Forgetful as I was, to bolt you in.      640"
8395,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","I left you reading, and from habit lock’d"

8404,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","The lady thank’d, her condescension praised,      650"
8405,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","And fix’d the hour for dinner, forth the Boy"
8406,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","Went in a tumult of o’erpowering joy,"
8407,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","To view the gardens, and what more was found"

8409,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","Till, with his thoughts bewilder’d, and oppress’d"
8410,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","With too much feeling, he inclined to rest."
8411,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","Then in the park he sought its deepest shade,"
8412,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","By trees more aged than the mansion made,"
8413,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",That ages stood; and there unseen a brook

8425,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",Rose on his passive fancy—then appear’d
8426,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",The fleshless forms of beings scorn’d or fear’d
8427,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",By just or evil men—the baneful race

8439,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",The waking boy obey’d that welcome sound.
8440,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","He went and sat, with equal shame and pride,"
8441,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._",A welcome guest at Madam Johnson’s side;
8442,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","At his right hand was Mistress Kitty placed,"
8443,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","And Lucy, maiden sly, the stripling faced."

8459,"_SILFORD HALL; OR, THE HAPPY DAY._","From whence he came, the road he should pursue;"

8499,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Where hopes of gain excite an anxious race;
8500,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Which dark, dense wreaths of cloudy volumes cloak,"
8501,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And mark, for leagues around, the place of smoke;"
8502,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Where fire to water lends its powerful aid,"
8503,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And steam produces—strong ally to trade—
8504,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Arrived a Stranger, whom no merchant knew,"
8505,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Nor could conjecture what he came to do.
8506,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He came not there his fortune to amend;
8507,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He came not there a fortune made to spend;      10
8508,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,His age not that which men in trade employ;
8509,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The place not that where men their wealth enjoy;
8510,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet there was something in his air that told
8511,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of competency gain’d, before the man was old."
8512,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He brought no servants with him; those he sought
8513,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Were soon his habits and his manners taught—
8514,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His manners easy, civil, kind, and free;"
8515,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His habits such as aged men’s will be,"
8516,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To self indulgent; wealthy men like him
8517,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Plead for these failings—’tis their way, their whim.      20"
8518,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His frank good-humour, his untroubled air,"
8519,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His free address, and language bold but fair,"
8520,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Soon made him friends—such friends as all may make,"
8521,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Who take the way that he was pleased to take.
8522,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He gave his dinners in a handsome style,"
8523,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And met his neighbours with a social smile;
8524,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The wealthy all their easy friend approved,"
8525,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Whom the more liberal for his bounty loved;
8526,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And ev’n the cautious and reserved began
8527,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To speak with kindness of the frank old man,      30"
8528,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who, though associate with the rich and grave,"
8529,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Laugh’d with the gay, and to the needy gave"
8530,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What need requires. At church a seat was shown,"
8531,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That he was kindly ask’d to think his own.
8532,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Thither he went, and neither cold nor heat,"
8533,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Pains or pretences, kept him from his seat."
8534,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"This to his credit in the town was told,"
8535,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And ladies said, “’Tis pity he is old;"

8537,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who, of his race, has no small part to run.”      40"
8538,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"No envy he by ostentation raised,"
8539,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And all his hospitable table praised.
8540,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His quiet life censorious talk suppress’d,"
8541,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And numbers hail’d him as their welcome guest.
8542,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"’Twas thought a man so mild, and bounteous too,"
8543,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,A world of good within the town might do;
8544,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To vote him honours, therefore, they inclined;"
8545,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But these he sought not, and with thanks resign’d;"
8546,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His days of business, he declared, were past,"
8547,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And he would wait in quiet for the last;      50
8548,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But for a dinner and a day of mirth
8549,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He was the readiest being upon earth.
8550,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Men call’d him Captain, and they found the name"
8551,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,By him accepted without pride or shame.
8552,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Not in the Navy—that did not appear:
8553,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Not in the Army—that at least was clear—
8554,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“But as he speaks of sea-affairs, he made,"
8555,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"No doubt, his fortune in the way of trade;"
8556,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He might, perhaps, an India-ship command—"
8557,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,We’ll call him Captain now he comes to land.”      60
8558,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The Stranger much of various life had seen,"
8559,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Been poor, been rich, and in the state between;"
8560,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Had much of kindness met, and much deceit,"
8561,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And all that man who deals with men must meet.
8562,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Not much he read; but from his youth had thought,"
8563,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And been by care and observation taught:
8564,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,’Tis thus a man his own opinions makes;
8565,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He holds that fast, which he with trouble takes;"
8566,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"While one whose notions all from books arise,      }"
8567,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Upon his authors, not himself, relies—      70}"

8573,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Man upon man depends, and, break the chain,"
8574,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He soon returns to savage life again;

8579,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"While to the general welfare all belong,"
8580,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The high in power, the low in number strong.”"
8581,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Such was the Stranger’s creed—if not profound,"
8582,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He judg’d it useful, and proclaimed it sound;"
8583,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And many liked it; invitations went
8584,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To Captain Elliot, and from him were sent—"
8585,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"These last so often, that his friends confess’d,"
8586,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The Captain’s cook had not a place of rest.
8587,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Still were they something at a loss to guess      90
8588,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,What his profession was from his address;
8589,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For much he knew, and too correct was he"
8590,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For a man train’d and nurtured on the sea;
8591,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet well he knew the seaman’s words and ways—
8592,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Seaman’s his look, and nautical his phrase:"
8593,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In fact, all ended, just where they began,"
8594,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,With many a doubt of this amphibious man.

8600,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Or by what ways, what virtues—not a cause"
8601,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Can we assign, for Fancy has no laws;"
8602,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But, as the Captain show’d them such respect,"
8603,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,We will not treat the Dysons with neglect.
8604,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Their Father died, while yet engaged by trade"
8605,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To make a fortune that was never made,"
8606,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But to his children taught; for he would say
8607,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“I place them—all I can—in Fortune’s way.”      110
8608,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"James was his first-born; when his father died,"
8609,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He, in their large domain, the place supplied,"
8610,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And found, as to the Dysons all appear’d,"
8611,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Affairs less gloomy than their sire had fear’d;
8612,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But then, if rich or poor, all now agree,"
8613,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Frugal and careful James must wealthy be:
8614,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, wealth in wedlock sought, he married soon,"
8615,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And ruled his Lady from the honey-moon.
8616,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nor shall we wonder; for, his house beside,      }"
8617,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He had a sturdy multitude to guide,      120}"
8618,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who now his spirit vex’d, and now his temper tried:      }"
8619,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Men who by labours live, and, day by day,"
8620,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Work, weave, and spin their active lives away;"
8621,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Like bees industrious, they for others strive,"
8622,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With, now and then, some murmuring in the hive."
8623,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,James was a churchman—’twas his pride and boast;
8624,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Loyal his heart, and “Church and King” his toast;"
8625,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He for Religion might not warmly feel,"
8626,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But for the Church he had abounding zeal.
8627,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet no dissenting sect would he condemn,      130"
8628,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“They’re nought to us,” said he, “nor we to them;"
8629,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"’Tis innovation of our own I hate,"
8630,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Whims and inventions of a modern date.
8631,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Why send you Bibles all the world about,"
8632,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That men may read amiss, and learn to doubt?"
8633,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Why teach the children of the poor to read,"
8634,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That a new race of doubters may succeed?
8635,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Now can you scarcely rule the stubborn crew,"
8636,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And what if they should know as much as you?
8637,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Will a man labour when to learning bred,      140"
8638,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Or use his hands who can employ his head?
8639,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Will he a clerk or master’s self obey,"
8640,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Who thinks himself as well-inform’d as they?”
8641,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"These were his favourite subjects—these he chose,"
8642,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And where he ruled no creature durst oppose.
8643,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“[We’re] rich,” quoth James; “but if we thus proceed,"
8644,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And give to all, we shall be poor indeed:"
8645,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,In war we subsidise the world—in peace
8646,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,We christianise—our bounties never cease;
8647,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"We learn each stranger’s tongue, that they with ease      150"
8648,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"May read translated Scriptures, if they please;"
8649,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"We buy them presses, print them books, and then"
8650,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Pay and export poor learned, pious men;"
8651,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Vainly we strive a fortune now to get,"
8652,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So tax’d by private claims, and public debt.”"
8653,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Still he proceeds—“You make your prisons light,"
8654,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Airy and clean, your robbers to invite;"
8655,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And in such ways your pity show to vice,"
8656,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That you the rogues encourage, and entice.”"
8657,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For lenient measures James had no regard—      160
8658,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Hardship,” he said, “must work upon the hard;"
8659,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Labour and chains such desperate men require;
8660,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To soften iron you must use the fire.”
8661,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Active himself, he labour’d to express,"
8662,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In his strong words, his scorn of idleness;"
8663,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,From him in vain the beggar sought relief—
8664,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Who will not labour is an idle thief,"
8665,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Stealing from those who will;” he knew not how
8666,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For the untaught and ill-taught to allow,"
8667,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Children of want and vice, inured to ill,      170"
8668,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Unchain’d the passions, and uncurb’d the will."
8669,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Alas! he look’d but to his own affairs,"
8670,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Or to the rivals in his trade, and theirs;"
8671,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Knew not the thousands who must all be fed,"
8672,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet ne’er were taught to earn their daily bread;
8673,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Whom crimes, misfortunes, errors only teach"
8674,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To seek their food where’er within their reach;
8675,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who for their parents’ sins, or for their own,"
8676,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Are now as vagrants, wanderers, beggars known,"
8677,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Hunted and hunting through the world, to share      180"
8678,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Alms and contempt, and shame and scorn to bear;"
8679,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Whom Law condemns, and Justice, with a sigh,"
8680,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Pursuing, shakes her sword and passes by.—"
8681,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If to the prison we should these commit,"
8682,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,They for the gallows will be render’d fit.
8683,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But James had virtues—was esteem’d as one
8684,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Whom men look’d up to, and relied upon."
8685,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Kind to his equals, social when they met—"
8686,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If out of spirits, always out of debt;"
8687,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"True to his promise, he a lie disdain’d,      190"
8688,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And e’en when tempted in his trade, refrain’d;"
8689,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Frugal he was, and loved the cash to spare,"
8690,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Gain’d by much skill, and nursed by constant care;"
8691,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet liked the social board, and when he spoke,"
8692,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some hail’d his wisdom, some enjoy’d his joke."
8693,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To him a Brother look’d as one to whom,"
8694,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If fortune frown’d, he might in trouble come;"
8695,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His Sisters view’d the important man with awe,"
8696,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As if a parent in his place they saw:
8697,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,All lived in Love; none sought their private ends:      200
8698,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The Dysons were a Family of Friends.
8699,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His brother David was a studious boy,"
8700,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet could his sports as well as books enjoy.
8701,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"E’en when a boy, he was not quickly read,"
8702,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If by the heart you judged him, or the head."
8703,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His father thought he was decreed to shine,"
8704,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And be in time an eminent Divine;
8705,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But if he ever to the Church inclined,"
8706,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,It is too certain that he changed his mind.
8707,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He spoke of scruples; but who knew him best      210
8708,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Affirm’d, no scruples broke on David’s rest."
8709,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Physic and Law were each in turn proposed,"
8710,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He weigh’d them nicely, and with Physic closed."
8711,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He had a serious air, a smooth address,"
8712,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And a firm spirit that ensured success.
8713,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He watched his brethren of the time, how they"
8714,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Rose into fame, that he might choose his way."
8715,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some, he observed, a kind of roughness used,"
8716,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And now their patients banter’d, now abused:"
8717,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The awe-struck people were at once dismay’d,      220"
8718,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As if they begg’d the advice for which they paid.
8719,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"There are who hold that no disease is slight,"
8720,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Who magnify the foe with whom they fight.
8721,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The sick was told that his was that disease
8722,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But rarely known on mortal frame to seize;
8723,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Which only skill profound, and full command"
8724,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of all the powers in nature could withstand.
8725,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Then, if he lived, what fame the conquest gave!"
8726,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And if he died—“No human power could save!”
8727,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Mere fortune sometimes, and a lucky case,      230"
8728,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Will make a man the idol of a place—
8729,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who last, advice to some fair duchess gave,"
8730,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Or snatch’d a widow’s darling from the grave,"
8731,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Him first she honours of the lucky tribe,"
8732,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Fills him with praise, and woos him to prescribe."
8733,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In his own chariot soon he rattles on,"
8734,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And half believes the lies that built him one.
8735,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But not of these was David: care and pain,"
8736,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And studious toil prepar’d his way to gain.
8737,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"At first observed, then trusted, he became      240"
8738,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"At length respected, and acquired a name."
8739,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Keen, close, attentive, he could read mankind,"
8740,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The feeble body, and the failing mind;"
8741,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And if his heart remain’d untouch’d, his eyes,"
8742,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His air, and tone, with all could sympathise."
8743,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"This brought him fees, and not a man was he"
8744,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,In weak compassion to refuse a fee.
8745,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet though the Doctor’s purse was well supplied,"
8746,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Though patients came, and fees were multiplied,"
8747,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some secret drain, that none presumed to know,      250"
8748,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And few e’en guess’d, for ever kept it low."
8749,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some of a patient spake, a tender fair,"
8750,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of whom the doctor took peculiar care,"
8751,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But not a fee; he, rather, largely gave,"
8752,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nor spared himself, ’twas said, this gentle friend to save."
8753,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Her case consumptive, with perpetual need"
8754,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Still to be fed, and still desire to feed;"
8755,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"An eager craving, seldom known to cease,"
8756,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And gold alone brought temporary peace.—
8757,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So, rich he was not; James some fear express’d,      260"
8758,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Dear Doctor David would be yet distress’d;
8759,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For if now poor, when so repaid his skill,"
8760,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What fate were his, if he himself were ill!"
8761,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In his religion, Doctor Dyson sought"
8762,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To teach himself—“A man should not be taught,"
8763,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Should not, by forms or creeds, his mind debase,"
8764,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That keep in awe an unreflecting race.”
8765,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He heeded not what Clarke and Paley say,"
8766,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But thought himself as good a judge as they;
8767,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet to the Church profess’d himself a friend,      270}"
8768,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And would the rector for his hour attend;      }
8769,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nay, praise the learn’d discourse, and learnedly defend.      }"
8770,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For, since the common herd of men are blind,"
8771,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He judged it right that guides should be assign’d;
8772,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And that the few who could themselves direct
8773,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Should treat those guides with honour and respect.
8774,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He was from all contracted notions freed,"
8775,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But gave his Brother credit for his creed;
8776,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, if in smaller matters he indulged,"
8777,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"’Twas well, so long as they were not divulged.      280"
8778,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oft was the spirit of the Doctor tried,"
8779,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,When his grave Sister wish’d to be his guide.
8780,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"She told him, “all his real friends were grieved"
8781,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To hear it said, how little he believed:"
8782,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of all who bore the name she never knew
8783,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,One to his pastor or his church untrue;
8784,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"All have the truth with mutual zeal profess’d,"
8785,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And why, dear Doctor, differ from the rest?”"
8786,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“’Tis my hard fate,” with serious looks replied"
8787,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The man of doubt, “to err with such a guide.”—      290"
8788,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“Then why not turn from such a painful state?”—
8789,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The doubting man replied, “It is my fate.”"
8790,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Strong in her zeal, by texts and reasons back’d,"
8791,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,In his grave mood the Doctor she attack’d;
8792,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Cull’d words from Scripture to announce his doom,"
8793,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And bade him “think of dreadful things to come.”
8794,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“If such,” he answer’d, “be that state untried,"
8795,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In peace, dear Martha, let me here abide;"
8796,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Forbear to insult a man whose fate is known,"
8797,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And leave to Heaven a matter all its own.”      300
8798,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In the same cause the Merchant, too, would strive;"
8799,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He ask’d, “Did ever unbeliever thrive?"
8800,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Had he respect? could he a fortune make?
8801,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And why not then such impious men forsake?”
8802,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Thanks, my dear James, and be assured I feel,"
8803,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If not your reason, yet at least your zeal;"
8804,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And when those wicked thoughts, that keep me poor,"
8805,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And bar respect, assail me as before"
8806,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With force combin’d, you’ll drive the fiend away;"
8807,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For you shall reason, James, and Martha pray.”      310"
8808,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But though the Doctor could reply with ease
8809,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To all such trivial arguments as these—
8810,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Though he could reason, or at least deride,"
8811,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,There was a power that would not be defied;
8812,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A closer reasoner, whom he could not shun,"
8813,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Could not refute, from whom he could not run:"
8814,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For Conscience lived within; she slept, ’tis true,"
8815,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But when she waked, her pangs awaken’d too."
8816,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"She bade him think; and, as he thought, a sigh"
8817,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of deep remorse precluded all reply.      320
8818,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"No soft insulting smile, no bitter jest,      }"
8819,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Could this commanding power of strength divest,      }"
8820,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But with reluctant fear her terrors he confess’d.      }
8821,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His weak advisers he could scorn or slight,      }"
8822,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But not their cause; for, in their folly’s spite,      }"
8823,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"They took the wiser part, and chose their way aright.      }"
8824,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Such was the Doctor, upon whom for aid"
8825,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Had some good ladies call’d, but were afraid—"
8826,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Afraid of one who, if report were just,"
8827,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The arm of flesh, and that alone, would trust.      330"
8828,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But these were few—the many took no care
8829,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of what they judged to be his own affair;
8830,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And if he them from their diseases freed,"
8831,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,They neither cared nor thought about his creed;
8832,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"They said his merits would for much atone,"
8833,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And only wonder’d that he lived alone.
8834,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The widow’d Sister near the Merchant dwelt,"
8835,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And her late loss with lingering sorrow felt.
8836,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Small was her jointure, and o’er this she sigh’d,      }"
8837,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That to her heart its bounteous wish denied,      340}"
8838,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Which yet all common wants, but not her all, supplied.      }"
8839,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Sorrows like showers descend, and as the heart"
8840,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For them prepares, they good or ill impart;"
8841,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some on the mind, as on the ocean rain,"
8842,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Fall and disturb, but soon are lost again;"
8843,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some, as to fertile lands, a boon bestow,"
8844,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And [seeds], that else had perish’d, live and grow;"
8845,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some fall on barren soil, and thence proceed"
8846,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The idle blossom, and the useless weed."
8847,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But how her griefs the Widow’s heart impress’d      350
8848,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Must from the tenor of her life be guess’d.
8849,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Rigid she was, persisting in her grief,"
8850,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Fond of complaint, and adverse to relief."
8851,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In her religion she was all severe,"
8852,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And as she was, was anxious to appear."
8853,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When sorrow died restraint usurp’d the place,"
8854,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And sate in solemn state upon her face.
8855,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Reading she loved not, nor would deign to waste"
8856,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Her precious time on trifling works of taste;
8857,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Though what she did with all that precious time      360
8858,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"We know not, but to waste it was a crime—"
8859,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"As oft she said, when with a serious friend"
8860,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,She spent the hours as duty bids us spend;
8861,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To read a novel was a kind of sin—
8862,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Albeit once Clarissa took her in;
8863,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And now of late, she heard with much surprise,"
8864,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Novels there were that made a compromise
8865,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Betwixt amusement and religion: these
8866,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Might charm the worldly, whom the stories please,"
8867,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And please the serious, whom the sense would charm,      370"
8868,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And thus, indulging, be secured from harm—"
8869,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A happy thought, when from the foe we take"
8870,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His arms, and use them for religion’s sake."
8871,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Her Bible she perused by day, by night;"
8872,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,It was her task—she said ’twas her delight;
8873,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Found in her room, her chamber, and her pew,"
8874,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For ever studied, yet for ever new—"
8875,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"All must be new that we cannot retain,"
8876,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And new we find it when we read again.
8877,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The hardest texts she could with ease expound,      380"
8878,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And meaning for the most mysterious found,"
8879,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Knew which of dubious senses to prefer.
8880,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The want of Greek was not a want in her;—
8881,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Instinctive light no aid from Hebrew needs—
8882,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But full conviction without study breeds;
8883,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"O’er mortal powers by inborn strength prevails,"
8884,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Where Reason trembles, and where Learning fails."
8885,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To the church strictly from her childhood bred,"
8886,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,She now her zeal with party-spirit fed:
8887,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For brother James she lively hopes express’d,      390"
8888,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But for the Doctor’s safety felt distress’d;
8889,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And her light Sister, poor, and deaf, and blind,"
8890,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Fill’d her with fears of most tremendous kind.
8891,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But David mocked her for the pains she took,"
8892,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And Fanny gave resentment for rebuke;
8893,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"While James approved the zeal, and praised the call,"
8894,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“That brought,” he said, “a blessing on them all:"
8895,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Goodness like this to all the House extends,"
8896,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For were they not a Family of Friends?”
8897,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Their sister Frances, though her prime was past,      400"
8898,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Had beauty still—nay, beauty form’d to last;"
8899,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"’Twas not the lily and the rose combined,"
8900,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Nor must we say the beauty of the mind;
8901,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But feature, form, and that engaging air,"
8902,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That lives when ladies are no longer fair.
8903,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Lovers she had, as she remember’d yet,"
8904,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For who the glories of their reign forget?
8905,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Some she rejected in her maiden pride      }
8906,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And some in maiden hesitation tried—      }
8907,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Unwilling to renounce, unable to decide.      410}"
8908,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"One lost, another would her grace implore,"
8909,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Till all were lost, and lovers came no more."
8910,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nor had she that, in beauty’s failing state,"
8911,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Which will recall a lover, or create;"
8912,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Hers was the slender portion, that supplied"
8913,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Her real wants, but all beyond denied."
8914,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When Fanny Dyson reach’d her fortieth year,"
8915,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,She would no more of love or lovers hear;
8916,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But one dear Friend she chose, her guide, her stay"
8917,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And to each other all the world were they;      420
8918,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For all the world had grown to them unkind,"
8919,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"One sex censorious, and the other blind."
8920,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The Friend of Frances longer time had known
8921,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The world’s deceits, and from its follies flown."
8922,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,With her dear Friend life’s sober joys to share
8923,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Was all that now became her wish and care.
8924,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"They walk’d together, they conversed and read,"
8925,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And tender tears for well-feign’d sorrows shed:
8926,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And were so happy in their quiet lives,"
8927,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"They pitied sighing maids, and weeping wives.      430"
8928,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But Fortune to our state such change imparts,"
8929,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That Pity stays not long in human hearts;
8930,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When sad for others’ woes our hearts are grown,"
8931,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,This soon gives place to sorrows of our own.
8932,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,There was among our guardian Volunteers
8933,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,A Major Bright—he reckoned fifty years:
8934,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A reading man of peace, but call’d to take"
8935,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,His sword and musket for his country’s sake;
8936,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Not to go forth and fight, but here to stay,"
8937,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Invaders, should they come, to chase or slay.      440"
8938,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Him had the elder Lady long admired,"
8939,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As one from vain and trivial things retired;
8940,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,With him conversed; but to a Friend so dear
8941,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Gave not that pleasure—Why? is not so clear.
8942,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But chance effected this; the Major now
8943,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Gave both the time his duties would allow;
8944,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In walks, in visits, when abroad, at home,"
8945,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The friendly Major would to either come.
8946,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He never spoke—for he was not a boy—
8947,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of ladies’ charms, or lovers’ grief and joy.      450"
8948,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"All his discourses were of serious kind,"
8949,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The heart they touch’d not, but they fill’d the mind."
8950,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet—oh, the pity! from this grave good man"
8951,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The cause of coolness in the Friends began.
8952,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The sage Sophronia—that the chosen name—
8953,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Now more polite, and more estranged became."
8954,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,She could but feel that she had longer known
8955,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,This valued friend—he was indeed her own;
8956,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But Frances Dyson, to confess the truth,"
8957,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Had more of softness—yes, and more of youth;      460"
8958,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, though he said such things had ceased to please,"
8959,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The worthy Major was not blind to these:
8960,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So without thought, without intent, he paid"
8961,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,More frequent visits to the younger Maid.
8962,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Such the offence; and, though the Major tried"
8963,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To tie again the knot he thus untied,"
8964,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,His utmost efforts no kind looks repaid—
8965,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He moved no more the inexorable maid.
8966,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The Friends too parted, and the elder told"
8967,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Tales of false hearts, and friendships waxing cold;      470"
8968,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And wonder’d what a man of sense could see
8969,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,In the light airs of wither’d vanity.
8970,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"’Tis said that Frances now the world reviews,"
8971,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Unwilling all the little left to lose;
8972,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"She and the Major on the walks are seen,"
8973,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And all the world is wondering what they mean.
8974,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Such were the four whom Captain Elliot drew
8975,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To his own board, as the selected few."
8976,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For why? they seem’d each other to approve,"
8977,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And called themselves a Family of Love.      480
8978,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"These were not all: there was a Youth beside,"
8979,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Left to his uncles when his parents died;
8980,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A Girl, their sister, by a Boy was led      }"
8981,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To Scotland, where a boy and girl may wed—      }"
8982,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And they return’d to seek for pardon, pence, and bread.      }"
8983,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Five years they lived to labour, weep, and pray,"
8984,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When Death, in mercy, took them both away."
8985,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Uncles and aunts received this lively child,"
8986,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Grieved at his fate, and at his follies smiled;"
8987,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But, when the child to boy’s estate grew on,      490"
8988,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The smile was vanish’d, and the pity gone."
8989,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Slight was the burden, but in time increased,"
8990,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Until at length both love and pity ceased.
8991,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Then Tom was idle; he would find his way
8992,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To his aunt’s stores, and make her sweets his prey;"
8993,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"By uncle Doctor on a message sent,"
8994,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He stopp’d to play, and lost it as he went."
8995,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His grave aunt Martha, with a frown austere"
8996,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And a rough hand, produced a transient fear;"
8997,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But Tom, to whom his rude companions taught      500"
8998,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Language as rude, vindictive measures sought;"
8999,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He used such words that, when she wish’d to speak"
9000,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of his offence, she had her words to seek."
9001,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The little wretch had call’d her—’twas a shame
9002,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To think such thought, and more to name such name."
9003,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Thus fed and beaten, Tom was taught to pray"
9004,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For his true friends; “but who,” said he, “are they?”"
9005,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"By nature kind, when kindly used, the Boy"
9006,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Hail’d the strange good with tears of love and joy;
9007,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But, roughly used, he felt his bosom burn      510"
9008,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,With wrath he dared not on his uncles turn;
9009,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So with indignant spirit, still and strong,"
9010,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He nursed the vengeance, and endured the wrong."
9011,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To a cheap school, far north, the boy was sent:"
9012,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Without a tear of love or grief he went;
9013,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Where, doom’d to fast and study, fight and play,"
9014,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He staid five years, and wish’d five more to stay."
9015,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He loved o’er plains to run, up hills to climb,"
9016,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Without a thought of kindred, home, or time;"
9017,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Till from the cabin of a coasting hoy,      520"
9018,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Landed at last the thin and freckled boy,"
9019,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With sharp keen eye, but pale and hollow cheek,"
9020,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,All made more sad from sickness of a week.
9021,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,His aunts and uncles felt—nor strove to hide
9022,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"From the poor boy, their pity and their pride;"
9023,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He had been taught that he had not a friend
9024,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Save these on earth, on whom he might depend;"
9025,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And such dependence upon these he had
9026,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"As made him sometimes desperate, always sad."
9027,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Awkward and weak, where can the lad be placed,      530"
9028,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And we not troubled, censured, or disgraced?"
9029,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Do, Brother James, th’ unhappy boy enrol"
9030,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Among your set; you only can control.”
9031,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"James sigh’d, and Thomas to the Factory went,"
9032,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Who there his days in sundry duties spent.
9033,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He ran, he wrought, he wrote—to read or play"
9034,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He had no time, nor much to feed or pray."
9035,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,What pass’d without he heard not—or he heard
9036,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Without concern, what he nor wish’d nor fear’d;"
9037,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Told of the Captain and his wealth, he sigh’d,      540"
9038,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And said, “how well his table is supplied!”"
9039,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But with the sigh it caused the sorrow fled;      }
9040,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He was not feasted, but he must be fed;      }"
9041,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And he could sleep full sound, though not full soft his bed.      }"
9042,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But still, ambitious thoughts his mind possess’d,"
9043,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And dreams of joy broke in upon his rest.
9044,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Improved in person, and enlarged in mind,"
9045,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The good he found not he could hope to find;
9046,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Though now enslaved, he hail’d the approaching day,"
9047,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,When he should break his chains and flee away.      550
9048,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Such were the Dysons: they were first of those
9049,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Whom Captain Elliot as companions chose;
9050,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Them he invited, and the more approved,"
9051,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As it appear’d that each the other loved.
9052,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Proud of their brothers were the sister pair;
9053,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, if not proud, yet kind the brothers were."
9054,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"This pleased the Captain, who had never known,"
9055,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Or he had loved, such kindred of his own;"
9056,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Them he invited, save the Orphan lad,"
9057,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Whose name was not the one his Uncles had;      560
9058,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"No Dyson he, nor with the party came—"
9059,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The worthy Captain never heard his name;
9060,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Uncles and Aunts forbore to name the boy,"
9061,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For then, of course, must follow his employ."
9062,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Though all were silent, as with one consent,"
9063,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"None told another what his silence meant,"
9064,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What hers; but each suppress’d the useless truth,"
9065,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And not a word was mentioned of the youth.
9066,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Familiar grown, the Dysons saw their host,"
9067,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With none beside them; it became their boast,      570"
9068,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Their pride, their pleasure; but to some it seem’d"
9069,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Beyond the worth their talents were esteem’d.
9070,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,This wrought no change within the Captain’s mind;
9071,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To all men courteous, he to them was kind."
9072,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"One day with these he sat, and only these,"
9073,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"In a light humour, talking at his ease."
9074,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Familiar grown, he was disposed to tell"
9075,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of times long past, and what in them befell—"
9076,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Not of his life their wonder to attract,"
9077,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But the choice tale, or insulated fact.      580"
9078,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Then, as it seem’d, he had acquired a right"
9079,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To hear what they could from their stores recite.
9080,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Their lives, they said, were all of common kind;"
9081,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He could no pleasure in such trifles find.
9082,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,They had an Uncle—’tis their father’s tale—
9083,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Who in all seas had gone where ship can sail;
9084,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who in all lands had been, where men can live;"
9085,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“He could indeed some strange relations give,"
9086,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And many a bold adventure; but in vain
9087,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,We look for him; he comes not home again.”      590
9088,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“And is it so? why then, if so it be,”"
9089,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Said Captain Elliot, “you must look to me:"
9090,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I knew John Dyson”——Instant every one
9091,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Was moved to wonder—“Knew my Uncle John!
9092,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Can he be rich? be childless? he is old,"
9093,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That is most certain—What! can more be told?
9094,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Will he return, who has so long been gone,"
9095,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And lost to us? Oh! what of Uncle John?”
9096,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,This was aside: their unobservant friend
9097,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Seem’d on their thoughts but little to attend;      600
9098,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A traveller speaking, he was more inclined"
9099,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To tell his story than their thoughts to find.
9100,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Although, my Friends, I love you well, ’tis true,      }"
9101,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,’Twas your relation turn’d my mind to you;      }
9102,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For we were friends of old, and friends like us are few;      }"
9103,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, though from dearest friends a man will hide"
9104,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His private vices in his native pride,"
9105,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet such our friendship from its early rise,"
9106,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"We no reserve admitted, no disguise;"
9107,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But ’tis the story of my friend I tell,      610"
9108,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And to all others let me bid farewell.
9109,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Take each your glass, and you shall hear how John,"
9110,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"My old companion, through the world has gone;"
9111,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I can describe him to the very life,"
9112,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Him and his ways, his ventures, and his wife.”"
9113,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Wife!” whisper’d all; “then what his life to us,"
9114,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His ways and ventures, if he ventured thus?”"
9115,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"This, too, apart; yet were they all intent,"
9116,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, gravely listening, sigh’d with one consent."
9117,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“My friend, your Uncle, was design’d for trade,      620"
9118,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To make a fortune as his father made;
9119,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But early he perceived the house declined,"
9120,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And his domestic views at once resign’d;
9121,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"While stout of heart, with life in every limb,"
9122,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He would to sea, and either sink or swim."
9123,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"No one forbad; his father shook his hand,"
9124,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Within it leaving what he could command.
9125,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“He left his home, but I will not relate"
9126,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What storms he braved, and how he bore his fate,"
9127,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Till his brave frigate was a Spanish prize,      630"
9128,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And prison-walls received his first-born sighs—
9129,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Sighs for the freedom that an English boy,"
9130,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Or English man, is eager to enjoy."
9131,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Exchanged, he breathed in freedom, and aboard"
9132,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"An English ship, he found his peace restored;"
9133,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"War raged around, each British tar was press’d"
9134,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To serve his king, and John among the rest;"
9135,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oft had he fought and bled, and ’twas his fate"
9136,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,In that same ship to grow to man’s estate.
9137,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Again ’twas war: of France a ship appear’d      640
9138,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of greater force, but neither shunn’d nor fear’d;"
9139,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"’Twas in the Indian Sea, the land was nigh,"
9140,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When all prepared to fight, and some to die;"
9141,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Man after man was in the ocean thrown,      }"
9142,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Limb after limb was to the surgeon shown,      }"
9143,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And John at length, poor John! held forth his own.—      }"
9144,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“A tedious case—the battle ceased with day,"
9145,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And in the night the foe had slipp’d away.
9146,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of many wounded were a part convey’d
9147,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To land, and he among the number laid.      650"
9148,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Poor, suffering, friendless—who shall now impart"
9149,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Life to his hope, or comfort to his heart?"
9150,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,A kind good priest among the English there
9151,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Selected him as his peculiar care;
9152,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, when recover’d, to a powerful friend"
9153,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Was pleased the lad he loved to recommend;
9154,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who read your Uncle’s mind, and, pleased to read,"
9155,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Placed him where talents will in time succeed.
9156,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“I will not tease you with details of trade,"
9157,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But say he there a decent fortune made—      660
9158,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Not such as gave him, if return’d, to buy"
9159,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A duke’s estate, or principality,"
9160,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But a fair fortune; years of peace he knew,"
9161,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That were so happy, and that seem’d so few."
9162,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“Then came a cloud; for who on earth has seen
9163,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A changeless fortune, and a life serene?"
9164,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Ah! then how joyous were the hours we spent!
9165,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But joy is restless, joy is not content."
9166,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“There one resided, who, to serve his friend,"
9167,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Was pleased a gay fair lady to commend;      670
9168,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Was pleased t’ invite the happy man to dine,"
9169,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And introduced the subject o’er their wine;
9170,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Was pleased the lady his good friend should know,"
9171,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And as a secret his regard would show.
9172,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“A modest man lacks courage; but, thus train’d,"
9173,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Your Uncle sought her favour and obtain’d.
9174,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To me he spake, enraptured with her face,"
9175,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Her angel smile, her unaffected grace;"
9176,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Her fortune small indeed; but, ‘curse the pelf,"
9177,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,She is a glorious fortune in herself!’      680
9178,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"‘John!’ answer’d I, ‘friend John, to be sincere,"
9179,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"These are fine things, but may be bought too dear."
9180,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"You are no stripling, and, it must be said,"
9181,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Have not the form that charms a youthful maid.
9182,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What you possess, and what you leave behind,"
9183,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When you depart, may captivate her mind;"
9184,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And I suspect she will rejoice at heart,"
9185,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Your will once made, if you should soon depart.’"
9186,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Long our debate, and much we disagreed;"
9187,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"‘You need no wife,’ I said—said he, ‘I need;      690"
9188,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I want a house, I want in all I see"
9189,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To take an interest; what is mine to me?’
9190,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So spake the man, who to his word was just,"
9191,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And took the words of others upon trust.
9192,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He could not think that friend in power so high,"
9193,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So much esteem’d, could like a villain lie;"
9194,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nor, till the knot, the fatal knot, was tied,"
9195,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Had urged his wedding a dishonour’d bride.
9196,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The man he challenged, for his heart was rent"
9197,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With rage and grief, and was to prison sent;      700"
9198,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For men in power—and this, alas! was one—"
9199,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Revenge on all the wrongs themselves have done;
9200,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And he whose spirit bends not to the blow      }
9201,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The tyrants strike shall no forgiveness know;      }
9202,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For ’tis to slaves alone that tyrants favour show.      }
9203,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“This cost him much; but that he did not heed;
9204,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The lady died, and my poor friend was freed."
9205,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"‘Enough of ladies!’ then said he, and smiled;"
9206,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,‘I’ve now no longings for a neighbour’s child.’
9207,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So patient he return’d, and not in vain,      710"
9208,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To his late duties, and grew rich again."
9209,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He was no miser; but the man who takes
9210,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Care to be rich will love the gain he makes;
9211,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Pursuing wealth, he soon forgot his woes;"
9212,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,No acts of his were bars to his repose.
9213,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Now John was rich, and, old and weary grown,"
9214,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Talk’d of the country that he calls his own—
9215,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And talk’d to me; for now, in fact, began"
9216,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,My better knowledge of the real man.
9217,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Though long estranged, he felt a strong desire,      720"
9218,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That made him for his former friends enquire;
9219,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What Dysons yet remain’d, he long’d to know,"
9220,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And doubtless meant some proofs of love to show.
9221,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His purpose known, our native land I sought,"
9222,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And with the wishes of my Friend am fraught.”
9223,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Fix’d were all eyes, suspense each bosom shook,"
9224,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And expectation hung on every look.
9225,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“‘Go to my kindred, seek them all around,"
9226,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Find all you can, and tell me all that’s found;"
9227,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Seek them if prosperous, seek them in distress,      730"
9228,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Hear what they need, know what they all possess;"
9229,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What minds, what hearts they have, how good they are,"
9230,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"How far from goodness—speak, and no one spare,"
9231,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And no one slander: let me clearly see
9232,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What is in them, and what remains for me.’"
9233,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Such is my charge, and haply I shall send"
9234,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Tidings of joy and comfort to my Friend.
9235,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oft would he say, ‘If of our race survive"
9236,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some two or three, to keep the name alive—"
9237,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I will not ask if rich or great they be,      740"
9238,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But if they live in love, like you and me.’"
9239,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“’Twas not my purpose yet awhile to speak
9240,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As I have spoken; but why further seek?
9241,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,All that I heard I in my heart approve;
9242,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,You are indeed a Family of Love;
9243,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And my old friend were happy in the sight
9244,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of those of whom I shall such tidings write.”
9245,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The Captain wrote not: he perhaps was slow;
9246,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Perhaps he wish’d a little more to know.
9247,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He wrote not yet; and, while he thus delay’d,      750"
9248,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Frances alone an early visit paid.
9249,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The maiden Lady braved the morning cold,"
9250,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To tell her Friend what duty bade be told,"
9251,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet not abruptly—she has first to say,"
9252,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“How cold the morning, but how fine the day!—"
9253,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I fear you slept but ill, we kept you long,"
9254,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"You made us all so happy, but ’twas wrong—"
9255,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So entertain’d, no wonder we forgot"
9256,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,How the time pass’d; I fear me you did not.”
9257,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,In this fair way the Lady seldom fail’d      760
9258,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To steer her course, still sounding as she sail’d."
9259,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Dear Captain Elliot, how your Friends you read!"
9260,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,We are a loving Family indeed;
9261,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Left in the world each other’s aid to be,"
9262,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And join to raise a fallen family.
9263,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oh! little thought we there was one so near,"
9264,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And one so distant, to us all so dear—"
9265,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"All, all alike; he cannot know, dear man!"
9266,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who needs him most, as one among us can:"
9267,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"One who can all our wants distinctly view,      770"
9268,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And tell him fairly what were just to do.
9269,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But you, dear Captain Elliot, as his friend,"
9270,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"As ours, no doubt, will your assistance lend."
9271,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Not for the world would I my Brothers blame;
9272,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Good men they are: ’twas not for that I came.
9273,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"No! did they guess what shifts I make, the grief"
9274,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That I sustain, they’d fly to my relief;"
9275,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But I am proud as poor; I cannot plead
9276,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"My cause with them, nor show how much I need."
9277,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But to my Uncle’s Friend it is no shame,      780"
9278,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nor have I fear, to seem the thing I am;"
9279,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"My humble pittance life’s mere need supplies,"
9280,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But all indulgence, all beyond denies."
9281,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I aid no pauper, I myself am poor;"
9282,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I cannot help the beggar at my door;
9283,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I from my scanty table send no meat;
9284,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Cook’d and recook’d is every joint I eat.
9285,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,At Church a sermon begs our help—I stop
9286,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And drop a tear; nought else have I to drop;
9287,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But pass the out-stretch’d plate with sorrow by,      790"
9288,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And my sad heart this kind relief deny.
9289,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,My dress—I strive with all my maiden skill
9290,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To make it pass, but ’tis disgraceful still;"
9291,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet from all others I my wants conceal—
9292,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oh! Captain Elliot, there are few that feel!"
9293,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But did that rich and worthy Uncle know      }
9294,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What you, dear Sir, will in your kindness show,      }"
9295,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,He would his friendly aid with generous hand bestow.      }
9296,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Good men my Brothers both, and both are raised"
9297,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Far above want—the Power that gave be praised!      800
9298,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"My Sister’s jointure, if not ample, gives"
9299,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"All she can need, who as a lady lives;"
9300,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But I, unaided, may through all my years"
9301,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Endure these ills—forgive these foolish tears.
9302,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Once, my dear Sir—I then was young and gay,"
9303,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And men would talk—but I have had my day:
9304,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Now all I wish is so to live, that men"
9305,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,May not despise me whom they flatter’d then.
9306,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If you, kind Sir——"
9307,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Thus far the Captain heard,"
9308,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Nor save by sign or look had interfered;      810
9309,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But now he spoke; to all she said agreed,"
9310,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And she conceived it useless to proceed.
9311,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Something he promised, and the Lady went"
9312,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Half-pleased away, yet wondering what he meant;"
9313,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Polite he was and kind, but she could trace"
9314,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A smile, or something like it, in his face;"
9315,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,’Twas not a look that gave her joy or pain—
9316,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"She tried to read it, but she tried in vain."
9317,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Then call’d the Doctor—’twas his usual way—
9318,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To ask “How fares my worthy friend to-day?”      820
9319,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To feel his pulse, and as a friend to give"
9320,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Unfee’d advice, how such a man should live;"
9321,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And thus, digressing, he could soon contrive,"
9322,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,At his own purpose smoothly to arrive.
9323,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“My Brother? yes, he lives without a care,"
9324,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, though he needs not, yet he loves to spare."
9325,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"James I respect; and yet it must be told,"
9326,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"His speech is friendly, but his heart is cold."
9327,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,His smile assumed has not the real glow
9328,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of love!—a sunbeam shining on the snow.      830
9329,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Children he has; but are they causes why
9330,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He should our pleas resist, our claims deny?"
9331,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Our father left the means by which he thrives,"
9332,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,While we are labouring to support our lives—
9333,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"_We_, need I say? my widow’d Sister lives"
9334,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"On a large jointure; nay, she largely gives;—"
9335,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And Fanny sighs—for gold does Fanny sigh?
9336,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Or wants she that which money cannot buy—
9337,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Youth and young hopes?—Ah! could my kindred share
9338,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The liberal mind’s distress, and daily care,      840"
9339,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The painful toil to gain the petty fee—
9340,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"They’d bless their stars, and join to pity me."
9341,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Hard is his fate, who would, with eager joy,"
9342,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To save mankind, his every power employ;"
9343,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet in his walk unnumber’d insults meets
9344,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And gains ‘mid scorn the food that chokes him as he eats.
9345,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Oh, Captain Elliot! you who know mankind,"
9346,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With all the anguish of the feeling mind,"
9347,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Bear to our kind relation these the woes
9348,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That e’en to you ’tis misery to disclose.      850
9349,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,You can describe what I but faintly trace—
9350,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,A man of learning cannot bear disgrace;
9351,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Refinement sharpens woes that wants create,"
9352,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And ’tis fresh grief such grievous things to state;
9353,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet those so near me let me not reprove—
9354,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I love them well, and they deserve my love;"
9355,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But want they know not—Oh! that I could say
9356,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I am in this as ignorant as they.”
9357,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The Doctor thus.—The Captain grave and kind,      }"
9358,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To the sad tale with serious looks inclined,      860}"
9359,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And promise made to keep th’ important speech in mind.      }
9360,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"James and the Widow, how is yet unknown,"
9361,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Heard of these visits, and would make their own."
9362,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"All was not fair, they judged, and both agreed"
9363,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To their good Friend together to proceed.
9364,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Forth then they went to see him, and persuade—"
9365,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As warm a pair as ever Anger made.
9366,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The Widow lady must the speaker be:
9367,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,So James agreed; for words at will had she;
9368,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And then her Brother, if she needed proof,      870"
9369,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Should add, “’Tis truth;”—it was for him enough."
9370,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Oh, sir! it grieves me”—for we need not dwell"
9371,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,On introduction: all was kind and well—
9372,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oh, sir! it grieves, it shocks us both to hear      }"
9373,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What has, with selfish purpose, gain’d your ear—      }"
9374,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Our very flesh and blood, and, as you know, how dear.      }"
9375,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Doubtless they came your noble mind t’ impress
9376,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,With strange descriptions of their own distress;
9377,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But I would to the Doctor’s face declare,      }"
9378,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That he has more to spend and more to spare,      880}"
9379,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With all his craft, than we with all our care.      }"
9380,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“And for our Sister, all she has she spends"
9381,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Upon herself; herself alone befriends.
9382,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"She has the portion that our father left,"
9383,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"While me of mine a careless wretch bereft,"
9384,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Save a small part; yet I could joyful live,"
9385,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Had I my mite—the widow’s mite—to give.
9386,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For this she cares not; Frances does not know
9387,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Their heartfelt joy who largely can bestow.
9388,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"You, Captain Elliot, feel the pure delight,      890"
9389,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That our kind acts in tender hearts excite,"
9390,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When to the poor we can our alms extend,"
9391,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And make the Father of all Good our friend;
9392,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, I repeat, I could with pleasure live,"
9393,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Had I my mite—the widow’s mite—to give.
9394,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“We speak not thus, dear Sir, with vile intent,"
9395,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Our nearest friends to wrong or circumvent;
9396,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But that our Uncle, worthy man! should know"
9397,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"How best his wealth, Heaven’s blessing, to bestow:"
9398,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What widows need, and chiefly those who feel      900"
9399,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,For all the sufferings which they cannot heal;
9400,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And men in trade, with numbers in their pay,"
9401,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who must be ready for the reckoning-day,"
9402,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Or gain or lose!”—
9403,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"—“Thank Heaven,” said James, “as yet"
9404,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I’ve not been troubled by a dun or debt.”
9405,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"—The Widow sigh’d, convinced that men so weak"
9406,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Will ever hurt the cause for which they speak;
9407,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"However tempted to deceive, still they"
9408,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Are ever blundering to the broad high-way
9409,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of very truth.—But Martha pass’d it by      910
9410,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"With a slight frown, and half-distinguish’d sigh.—"
9411,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Say to our Uncle, sir, how much I long"
9412,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To see him sit his kindred race among;
9413,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To hear his brave exploits, to nurse his age,"
9414,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And cheer him in his evening’s pilgrimage.
9415,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,How were I blest to guide him in the way
9416,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Where the religious poor in secret pray;
9417,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,To be the humble means by which his heart
9418,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And liberal hand might peace and joy impart!
9419,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But now, farewell!”—and slowly, softly fell      920"
9420,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The tender accents as she said “farewell!”
9421,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The Merchant stretch’d his hand, his leave to take,"
9422,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And gave the Captain’s a familiar shake;
9423,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Yet seem’d to doubt if this was not too free;
9424,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But, gaining courage, said, “Remember me.”"
9425,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Some days elaps’d; the Captain did not write,"
9426,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But still was pleased the party to invite;
9427,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, as he walk’d, his custom every day,"
9428,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"A tall pale stripling met him on his way,"
9429,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Who made some efforts, but they proved too weak,      930"
9430,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And only show’d he was inclined to speak.
9431,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“What would’st thou, lad?” the Captain ask’d, and gave"
9432,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The youth a power his purposed boon to crave,"
9433,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Yet not in terms direct—“My name,” quoth he,"
9434,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“Is Thomas Bethel; you have heard of me”—
9435,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Not good nor evil, Thomas—had I need"
9436,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Of so much knowledge;—but pray now proceed.”—
9437,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“Dyson’s my mother’s name; but I have not
9438,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That interest with you, and the worse my lot."
9439,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I serve my Uncle James, and run and write,      940"
9440,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And watch and work from morning until night;
9441,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Confined among the looms, and webs, and wheels,"
9442,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,You cannot think how like a slave one feels.
9443,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,’Tis said you have a ship at your command—
9444,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"An’ please you, sir, I’m weary of the land,"
9445,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And I have read of foreign parts such things
9446,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As make me sick of Uncle’s wheels and springs.”
9447,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“But, Thomas, why to sea? you look too slim"
9448,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For that rough work—and, Thomas, can you swim?”"
9449,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That he could not, but still he scorn’d a lie,      950"
9450,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And boldly answer’d, “No, but I can try.”—"
9451,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Well, my good lad, but tell me, can you read?”"
9452,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Now, with some pride he answer’d, “Yes, indeed!"
9453,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I construe Virgil, and our usher said,"
9454,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I might have been in Homer had I staid;
9455,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And he was sorry when I came away,"
9456,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And so was I, but Uncle would not pay;"
9457,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He told the master I had read enough,"
9458,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And Greek was all unprofitable stuff;
9459,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So all my learning now is thrown away,      960"
9460,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And I’ve no time for study or for play;
9461,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I’m ordered here and there, above, below,"
9462,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And call’d a dunce for what I cannot know;
9463,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Oh, that I were but from this bondage free!"
9464,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Do, please your honour, let me go to sea.”—"
9465,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“But why to sea? they want no Latin there;
9466,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Hard is their work, and very hard their fare.”"
9467,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“But then,” said Thomas, “if on land, I doubt"
9468,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,My Uncle Dyson soon would find me out;
9469,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, though he tells me what I yearly cost,      970"
9470,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,’Tis my belief he’d miss me were I lost.
9471,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For he has said, that I can act as well"
9472,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,As he himself—but this you must not tell.”—
9473,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Tell, Thomas! no, I scorn the base design,"
9474,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Give me your hand, I pledge my word with mine;"
9475,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And, if I cannot do thee good, my friend,"
9476,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Thou may’st at least upon that word depend.
9477,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And hark ye, lad, thy worthy name retain"
9478,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"To the last hour, or I shall help in vain;"
9479,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And then the more severe and hard thy part,      980"
9480,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Thine the more praise, and thine the happier art."
9481,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,We meet again—farewell!”—and Thomas went
9482,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Forth to his tasks, half angry, half content."
9483,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“I never ask’d for help,” thought he, “but twice,"
9484,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And all they then would give me was advice;
9485,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"My Uncle Doctor, when I begg’d his aid,"
9486,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Bade me work on, and never be afraid,"
9487,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But still be good; and I’ve been good so long,"
9488,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,I’m half persuaded that they tell me wrong.
9489,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And now this Captain still repeats the same;      990
9490,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But who can live upon a virtuous name,"
9491,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Starving and praised?—‘have patience—patience still!’
9492,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He said, and smiled; and, if I can, I will.”"
9493,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,So Thomas rested with a mind intent
9494,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,On what the Captain by his kindness meant.
9495,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Again the invited party all attend,"
9496,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"These dear relations, on this generous Friend."
9497,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"They ate, they drank, each striving to appear"
9498,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Fond, frank, forgiving—above all, sincere."
9499,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Such kindred souls could not admit disguise,      1000"
9500,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Or envious fears, or painful jealousies;"
9501,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So each declared, and all in turn replied,"
9502,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“’Tis just indeed, and cannot be denied.”"
9503,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Now various subjects rose—the country’s cause,"
9504,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The war, the allies, the lottery, and the laws."
9505,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The widow’d Sister then advantage took
9506,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Of a short pause, and, smiling softly, spoke:"
9507,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,She judged what subject would his mind excite—
9508,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“Tell us, dear Captain, of that bloody fight,"
9509,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"When our brave Uncle, bleeding at his gun,      1010"
9510,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Gave a loud shout to see the Frenchmen run.”
9511,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“Another day”—replied the modest host;
9512,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“One cannot always of one’s battles boast.
9513,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Look not surprise—behold the man in me!
9514,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Another Uncle shall you never see.
9515,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,No other Dyson to this place shall come;
9516,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Here end my travels, here I place my home;"
9517,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Here to repose my shatter’d frame I mean,"
9518,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Until the last long journey close the scene.”
9519,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,The Ladies softly brush’d the tear away;      1020
9520,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"James look’d surprise, but knew not what to say;"
9521,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But Doctor Dyson lifted up his voice,"
9522,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And said, “Dear Uncle, how we all rejoice!”"
9523,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“No question, Friends! and I your joy approve,"
9524,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"We are, you know, a Family of Love.”"
9525,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"So said the wary Uncle, but the while      }"
9526,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Wore on his face a questionable smile,      }"
9527,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That vanish’d, as he spake in grave and solemn style—      }"
9528,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“Friends and relations! let us henceforth seem
9529,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Just as we are, nor of our virtues dream,      1030"
9530,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That with our waking vanish.—What we are
9531,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Full well we know—t’ improve it be our care.
9532,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Forgive the trial I have made: ’tis one
9533,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That has no more than I expected done.
9534,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"If as frail mortals you, my Friends, appear,"
9535,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I look’d for no angelic beings here,"
9536,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For none that riches spurn’d as idle pelf,"
9537,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Or served another as he served himself.
9538,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Deceived no longer, let us all forgive;"
9539,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"I’m old, but yet a tedious time may live.      1040"
9540,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"This dark complexion India’s suns bestow,"
9541,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,These shrivell’d looks to years of care I owe;
9542,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,But no disease ensures my early doom—
9543,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And I may live—forgive me—years to come.
9544,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But, while I live, there may some good be done,"
9545,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Perchance to many, but at least to One.”—"
9546,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Here he arose, retired, return’d, and brought"
9547,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"The Orphan boy, whom he had train’d and taught"
9548,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"For this his purpose; and the happy boy,"
9549,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Though bade to hide, could ill suppress, his joy.—      1050"
9550,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“This young relation, with your leave, I take,"
9551,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,That he his progress in the world may make—
9552,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Not in my house a slave or spy to be,"
9553,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"And first to flatter, then to govern me;—"
9554,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"He shall not nurse me when my senses sleep,"
9555,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"Nor shall the key of all my secrets keep,"
9556,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And be so useful that a dread to part
9557,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,Shall make him master of my easy heart;—
9558,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"But to be placed where merit may be proved,"
9559,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And all that now impedes his way removed.      1060
9560,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,“And now no more on these affairs I dwell;      }
9561,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What I possess that I alone can tell,      }"
9562,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,And to that subject we will bid farewell.      }
9563,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"As go I must, when Heaven is pleased to call,"
9564,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"What I shall leave will seem or large or small,"
9565,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"As you shall view it. When this pulse is still,"
9566,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"You may behold my wealth, and read my will."
9567,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"“And now, as Captain Elliot much has known,"
9568,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,"That to your Uncle never had been shown,"
9569,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,From him one word of honest counsel hear—      1070
9570,_THE FAMILY OF LOVE._,_And think it always gain to be sincere_.”

9620,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,These fair enslavers with their own deceit.
9621,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Finch was a younger brother’s youngest son,"

9623,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Who call’d him ‘Bob,’ and ‘Captain,’ by that name"
9624,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Anticipating future rank and fame;
9625,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Not but there was for this some fair pretence—
9626,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,He was a cornet in the Home Defence.      50
9627,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The Youth was ever drest in dapper style,"
9628,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Wore spotless linen, and a ceaseless smile;"
9629,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"His step was measured, and his air was nice—"
9630,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"They bought him high, who had him at the price"
9631,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"That his own judgment and becoming pride,"

9633,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A life he loved of liberty and ease,"
9634,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And all his pleasant labour was to please;
9635,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Not call’d at present hostile men to slay,"
9636,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,He made the hearts of gentle dames his prey.      60
9637,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Hence tales arose, and one of sad report:"
9638,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A fond, fair girl became his folly’s sport—"
9639,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A cottage lass, who “knew the youth would prove"
9640,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"For ever true, and give her love for love;"
9641,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Sure when he could, and that would soon be known,"
9642,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,He would be proud to show her as his own.”
9643,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"But still she felt the village damsels’ sneer,"
9644,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And her sad soul was fill’d with secret fear;
9645,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"His love excepted, earth was all a void,"
9646,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And he, the excepted man, her peace destroy’d.      70"
9647,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"When the poor Jane was buried, we could hear"

9649,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Stories like this were told, but yet, in time"
9650,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Fair ladies lost their horror at the crime.
9651,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"They knew that cottage girls were forward things,"

9658,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Who “never saw such sweetness in her life.”
9659,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Now, as the rector was the Uncle’s friend,"
9660,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"It pleased the Nephew there his steps to bend,"

9663,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A face so fair, a look so meek, he found"
9664,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Had pierced that heart no other nymph could wound.
9665,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Oh, sweet Maria”—so began the Youth"
9666,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,His meditations—“thine the simple truth!      90
9667,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Thou hast no wicked wisdom of thy sex,"
9668,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,No wish to gain a subject-heart—then vex.
9669,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,That heavenly bosom no proud passion swells;

9676,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,But such a maid will lighter bonds refuse!”      100
9677,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And was this youth a rake?—In very truth;
9678,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Yet, feeling love, he felt it as a youth;"
9679,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"If he had vices, they were laid aside;"
9680,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,He quite forgot the simple girl who died;
9681,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"With dear Maria he in peace would live,"
9682,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And what had pass’d—Maria would forgive.
9683,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,The fair Coquette at first was pleased to find
9684,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,A swain so knowing had become so blind;
9685,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And she determined, with her utmost skill,"
9686,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,To bind the rebel to her sovereign will.      110
9687,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"She heard the story of the old deceit,"
9688,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And now resolved he should with justice meet;—
9689,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Soon as she saw him on her hook secure,"
9690,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,He should the pangs of perjured man endure.”
9691,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"These her first thoughts—but as, from time to time,"
9692,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The Lover came, she dwelt not on his crime—"
9693,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Crime could she call it? prudes, indeed, condemn"
9694,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,These slips of youth—but she was not of them.”
9695,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"So gentler thoughts arose as, day by day,"
9696,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,The Captain came his passion to display.      120
9697,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"When he display’d his passion, and she felt,"
9698,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Not without fear, her heart begin to melt—"
9699,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Joy came with terror at a state so new;
9700,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Glad of his truth; if he indeed were true!
9701,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"This she decided as the heart decides,"
9702,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Resolved to be the happiest of brides.
9703,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Not great my fortune—hence,” said she, “’tis plain,"
9704,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Me, and not mine, dear Youth! he hopes to gain;"
9705,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Nor has he much; but, as he sweetly talks,"
9706,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"We from our cot shall have delightful walks,      130"
9707,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Love, lord within it! I shall smile to see"
9708,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,My little cherubs on the father’s knee.”
9709,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Then sigh’d the nymph, and in her fancied lot,"
9710,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,She all the mischiefs of the past forgot.
9711,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Such were their tender meditations; thus
9712,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Would they the visions of the day discuss:
9713,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Each, too, the old sad habits would no more"
9714,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Indulge; both dare be virtuous and be poor.
9715,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,They both had past the year when law allows
9716,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Free-will to lover who would fain be spouse:      140
9717,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Yet the good youth his Uncle’s sanction sought—
9718,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Marry her, Bob! and are you really caught?"
9719,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Then you’ve exchanged, I warrant, heart for heart—"
9720,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,’Tis well! I meant to warn her of your art;
9721,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,This Parson’s Babe has made you quite a fool—
9722,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,But are you sure your ardour will not cool?
9723,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Have you not habits, Boy? but take your chance!"
9724,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,How will you live? I cannot much advance.
9725,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,But hear you not what through the village flies
9726,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,That this your dove is famed for her disguise?      150
9727,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Yet, say they not, she leads a gayish life?"
9728,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Art sure she’ll show the virtues of a wife?”—
9729,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Oh, Sir, she’s all that mortal man can love!”—"
9730,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Then marry, Bob! and that the fact will prove—"
9731,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Yet, in a kind of lightness, folk agree.”—      }"
9732,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Lightness in her! indeed, it cannot be—      }"
9733,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,’Tis Innocence alone that makes her manners free.”—      }
9734,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Well, my good friend! then Innocence alone"
9735,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Is to a something like Flirtation prone;
9736,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And I advise—but let me not offend—      160
9737,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"That Prudence should on Innocence attend,"
9738,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Lest some her sportive purity mistake,"
9739,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And term your angel more than half a rake.”
9740,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The Nymph, now sure, could not entirely curb"
9741,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,The native wish her lover to disturb.
9742,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Oft he observed her, and could ill endure"
9743,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,The gentle coquetry of maid so pure:
9744,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Men he beheld press round her, and the Fair"
9745,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Caught every sigh, and smiled at every prayer;"
9746,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And grieved he was with jealous pains to see      170
9747,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,The effects of all her wit and pleasantry.
9748,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Yet why alarm’d?”—he said; “with so much sense,"
9749,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"She has no freedom, dashing, or pretence:"
9750,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"’Tis her gay mind, and I should feel a pride"
9751,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"In her chaste levities”—he said, and sigh’d."
9752,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Yet, when apart from company, he chose"
9753,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,To talk a little of his bosom’s woes—
9754,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"But one sweet smile, and one soft speech, suppress’d"
9755,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"All pain, and set his feeling heart at rest."
9756,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Nay, in return, she felt, or feign’d, a fear:      180"
9757,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,“He was too lively to be quite sincere—
9758,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"She knew a certain lady, and could name      }"
9759,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A certain time”—So, even was the blame,      }"
9760,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And thus the loving pair more deep in love became.      }
9761,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,They married soon—for why delay the thing      }
9762,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,That such amazing happiness would bring?—      }
9763,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Now of that blissful state, O Muse of Hymen! sing.      }"
9764,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Love dies all kinds of death: in some so quick
9765,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,It comes—he is not previously sick;
9766,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,But ere the sun has on the couple shed      190
9767,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The morning rays, the smile of Love is fled."
9768,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And what the cause? for Love should not expire,"
9769,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And none the reason of such fate require.
9770,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Both had a mask, that with such pains they wore;"
9771,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Each took it off when it avail’d no more.
9772,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,They had no feeling of each other’s pain;
9773,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,To wear it longer had been crime in vain.
9774,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"As in some pleasant eve we view the scene,"
9775,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Though cool yet calm, if joyless yet serene—"
9776,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Who has not felt a quiet still delight      200
9777,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"In the clear, silent, love-befriending night?"
9778,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The moon so sweetly bright, so softly fair,"
9779,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,That all but happy lovers would be there—
9780,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Thinking there must be in her still domain
9781,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Something that soothes the sting of mortal pain;
9782,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"While earth itself is dress’d in light so clear,"
9783,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,That they might rest contented to be here!
9784,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Such is the night; but, when the morn awakes,"
9785,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The storm arises, and the forest shakes;"
9786,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"This mighty change the grieving travellers find,      210"
9787,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,The freezing snows fast drifting in the wind;
9788,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Firs deeply laden shake the snowy top,"
9789,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Streams slowly freezing, fretting till they stop;"
9790,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And void of stars the angry clouds look down
9791,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"On the cold earth, exchanging frown with frown."
9792,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Such seem’d, at first, the cottage of our pair—"
9793,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Fix’d in their fondness, in their prospects fair;"
9794,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Youth, health, affection, all that life supplies,"
9795,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Bright as the stars that gild the cloudless skies—
9796,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Were theirs—or seem’d to be; but soon the scene      220
9797,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Was black as if its light had never been.
9798,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Weary full soon, and restless then, they grew;      }"
9799,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Then off the painful mask of prudence threw;      }
9800,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"For Time has told them all, and taught them what to rue.      }"
9801,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,They long again to tread the former round
9802,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Of dissipation—“Why should he be bound,"
9803,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,While his sweet inmate of the cottage sighs
9804,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"For adulation, rout, and rhapsodies?"
9805,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Not Love himself, did love exist, could lead"
9806,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A heart like hers, that flutter’d to be freed.”      230"
9807,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"But Love, or what seem’d like him, quickly died;"
9808,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Nor Prudence, nor Esteem, his place supplied."
9809,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Disguise thrown off, each reads the other’s heart,"
9810,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And feels with horror that they cannot part.
9811,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Still they can speak—and ’tis some comfort still,"
9812,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,That each can vex the other when they will:
9813,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Words half in jest to words in earnest led,      }"
9814,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And these the earnest angry passions fed,      }"
9815,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Till all was fierce reproach, and peace for ever fled.      }"
9816,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“And so you own it! own it to my face,      240"
9817,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Your love is vanish’d—infamous and base!”—
9818,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Madam, I loved you truly, while I deem’d"
9819,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,You were the truthful being that you seem’d;
9820,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"But, when I see your native temper rise"
9821,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Above control, and break through all disguise,"
9822,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Casting it off, as serpents do their skin,      }"
9823,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And showing all the folds of vice within—      }
9824,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,What see I then to love? was I in love with Sin?”—      }
9825,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“So may I think, and you may feel it too;"
9826,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"A loving couple, Sir, were Sin and you!      250"
9827,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Whence all this anger? is it that you find
9828,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,You cannot always make a woman blind?
9829,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,You talk of falsehood and disguise—talk on!
9830,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,But all my trust and confidence are gone;
9831,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Remember you, with what a serious air"
9832,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"You talk’d of love, as if you were at prayer?"
9833,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"You spoke of home-born comforts, quiet, ease,"
9834,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And the pure pleasure, that must always please,"
9835,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"With an assumed and sentimental air,"
9836,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Smiting your breast, and acting like a player.      260"
9837,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Then your life’s comfort! and your holy joys!
9838,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Holy, forsooth! and your sweet girls and boys,"
9839,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"How you would train them!—All this farce review,"
9840,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And then, Sir, talk of being just and true!”—"
9841,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,“Madam! your sex expects that ours should lie.
9842,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"The simple creatures know it, and comply—"
9843,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,You hate the truth; there’s nothing you despise
9844,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Like a plain man, who spurns your vanities."
9845,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Are you not early taught your prey to catch?
9846,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,When your mammas pronounce—‘A proper match!’      270
9847,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"What said your own?—‘Do, daughter! curb your tongue,"
9848,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"And you may win him, for the man is young;"
9849,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"But if he views you as ourselves, good-by"
9850,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,To speculation!—He will never try.’
9851,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Then is the mask assumed, and then you bait"
9852,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Your hook with kindness! and as anglers wait,"
9853,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Now here, now there, with keen and eager glance,"
9854,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Marking your victims as the shoals advance;
9855,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"When, if the gaping wretch should make a snap,"
9856,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"You jerk him up, and have him in your trap:      280"
9857,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Who gasping, panting, in your presence lies,"
9858,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And you exulting view the imprison’d prize.
9859,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,“Such are your arts! while he did but intend
9860,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"In harmless play an idle hour to spend,"

9866,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Thus he, ingenuous, easy, fond, and weak,      290"
9867,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,Speaks the rash words he has been led to speak;
9868,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Puts the dire question that he meant to shun,"

9870,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Well!” said the Wife, “admit this nonsense true—"
9871,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,A mighty prize she gains in catching you!
9872,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"For my part, Sir, I most sincerely wish"

9878,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"“Your reputation, Madam!—rest secure:"
9879,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"That will all scandal and reproach endure,"
9880,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,And be the same in worth; it is like him

9882,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Half raised above the storm, half sunk below,"
9883,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"It just exists, and that is all we know."
9884,_THE EQUAL MARRIAGE._,"Such the good name that you so much regard,"

9939,_RACHEL._,"Blow wind, turn tide!—Be sure the fleet will come.”"
9940,_RACHEL._,"Grown wilder still, the frantic creature strode"
9941,_RACHEL._,With hurried feet upon the flinty road.
9942,_RACHEL._,On her departing form I gazed with pain—
9943,_RACHEL._,"“And should you not,” I cried, “her ways restrain?"
9944,_RACHEL._,What hopes the wild deluded wretch to meet?
9945,_RACHEL._,And means she aught by this expected fleet?
9946,_RACHEL._,Knows she her purpose? has she hope to see
9947,_RACHEL._,Some friend to aid her in her poverty?      50
9948,_RACHEL._,Why leave her thus bewilder’d to pursue
9949,_RACHEL._,"The fancy’s good, that never comes in view?”—"
9950,_RACHEL._,"“Nay! she is harmless, and, if more confined,"
9951,_RACHEL._,Would more distress in the coercion find.
9952,_RACHEL._,"Save at the times when to the coast she flies,"
9953,_RACHEL._,"She rests, nor shows her mind’s obliquities;"
9954,_RACHEL._,"But ever talks she of the sea, and shows"
9955,_RACHEL._,Her sympathy with every wind that blows.
9956,_RACHEL._,"We think it, therefore, useless to restrain"
9957,_RACHEL._,A creature of whose conduct none complain;      60
9958,_RACHEL._,"Whose age and looks protect her—should they fail,"
9959,_RACHEL._,Her craft and wild demeanour will prevail.
9960,_RACHEL._,A soldier once attack’d her on her way—
9961,_RACHEL._,"She spared him not, but bade him kneel and pray—"
9962,_RACHEL._,Praying herself aloud—th’ astonish’d man
9963,_RACHEL._,"Was so confounded, that away he ran."
9964,_RACHEL._,"“Her sailor left her, with, perhaps, intent"
9965,_RACHEL._,To make her his—’tis doubtful what he meant:
9966,_RACHEL._,"But he was captured, and the life he led"
9967,_RACHEL._,Drove all such young engagements from his head.      70
9968,_RACHEL._,"On him she ever thought, and none beside,"
9969,_RACHEL._,"Seeking her love, were favour’d or denied;"
9970,_RACHEL._,"On her dear David she had fix’d her view,"
9971,_RACHEL._,And fancy judged him ever fond and true.
9972,_RACHEL._,"Nay, young and handsome—Time could not destroy—"
9973,_RACHEL._,No—he was still the same—her gallant boy!
9974,_RACHEL._,"Labour had made her coarse, and her attire"
9975,_RACHEL._,Show’d that she wanted no one to admire;
9976,_RACHEL._,None to commend her; but she could conceive
9977,_RACHEL._,"The same of him, as when he took his leave,      80"
9978,_RACHEL._,"And gaily told what riches he would bring,"
9979,_RACHEL._,And grace her hand with the symbolic ring.
9980,_RACHEL._,“With want and labour was her mind subdued;
9981,_RACHEL._,She lived in sorrow and in solitude.
9982,_RACHEL._,"Religious neighbours, kindly calling, found"
9983,_RACHEL._,"Her thoughts unsettled, anxious, and unsound;"
9984,_RACHEL._,"Low, superstitious, querulous, and weak,"
9985,_RACHEL._,"She sought for rest, but knew not how to seek;"
9986,_RACHEL._,"And their instructions, though in kindness meant"
9987,_RACHEL._,Were far from yielding the desired content.      90
9988,_RACHEL._,"They hoped to give her notions of their own,"
9989,_RACHEL._,And talk’d of ‘feelings’ she had never known;
9990,_RACHEL._,"They ask’d of her ‘experience,’ and they bred"
9991,_RACHEL._,In her weak mind a melancholy dread
9992,_RACHEL._,"Of something wanting in her faith, of some—"
9993,_RACHEL._,"She knew not what—‘acceptance,’ that should come;"
9994,_RACHEL._,"And, as it came not, she was much afraid"
9995,_RACHEL._,That she in vain had served her God and pray’d.
9996,_RACHEL._,“She thought her Lover dead. In prayer she named
9997,_RACHEL._,"The erring Youth, and hoped he was reclaim’d.      100"
9998,_RACHEL._,"This she confess’d; and trembling, heard them say,"
9999,_RACHEL._,‘Her prayers were sinful—So the papists pray.
10000,_RACHEL._,"Her David’s fate had been decided long,"
10001,_RACHEL._,And prayers and wishes for his state were wrong.’
10002,_RACHEL._,"“Had these her guides united love and skill,"
10003,_RACHEL._,They might have ruled and rectified her will;
10004,_RACHEL._,"But they perceived not the bewilder’d mind,"
10005,_RACHEL._,And show’d her paths that she could never find.
10006,_RACHEL._,"The weakness that was Nature’s, they reproved,"
10007,_RACHEL._,And all its comforts from the Heart removed.      110
10008,_RACHEL._,"“Ev’n in this state, she loved the winds that sweep"
10009,_RACHEL._,"O’er the wild heath, and curl the restless deep;"
10010,_RACHEL._,"A turf-built hut beneath a hill she chose,"
10011,_RACHEL._,"And oft at night in winter storms arose,"
10012,_RACHEL._,"Hearing, or dreaming, the distracted cry"
10013,_RACHEL._,Of drowning seamen on the breakers by;
10014,_RACHEL._,"For there were rocks, that when the tides were low"
10015,_RACHEL._,"Appear’d, and vanish’d when the waters flow;"
10016,_RACHEL._,"And there she stood, all patient to behold"
10017,_RACHEL._,Some seaman’s body on the billows roll’d.      120
10018,_RACHEL._,"“One calm, cold evening, when the moon was high,"
10019,_RACHEL._,"And rode sublime within the cloudless sky,"
10020,_RACHEL._,"She sat within her hut, nor seem’d to feel"
10021,_RACHEL._,"Or cold or want, but turn’d her idle wheel,"
10022,_RACHEL._,And with sad song its melancholy tone
10023,_RACHEL._,"Mix’d, all unconscious that she dwelt alone."
10024,_RACHEL._,"“But none will harm her—Or who, willing can?"
10025,_RACHEL._,She is too wretched to have fear of man—
10026,_RACHEL._,"Not man! but something—if it should appear,"
10027,_RACHEL._,That once was man—that something did she fear.      130
10028,_RACHEL._,“No causeless terror!—In that moon’s clear light
10029,_RACHEL._,"It came, and seem’d a parley to invite;"
10030,_RACHEL._,It was no hollow voice—no brushing by
10031,_RACHEL._,"Of a strange being, who escapes the eye—"
10032,_RACHEL._,"No cold or thrilling touch, that will but last"
10033,_RACHEL._,"While we can think, and then for ever past."
10034,_RACHEL._,"But this sad face—though not the same she knew,"
10035,_RACHEL._,Enough the same to prove the vision true—
10036,_RACHEL._,Look’d full upon her!—starting in affright
10037,_RACHEL._,"She fled, her wildness doubling at the sight;      140"
10038,_RACHEL._,"With shrieks of terror, and emotion strong,"
10039,_RACHEL._,"She pass’d it by, and madly rush’d along"
10040,_RACHEL._,"To the bare rocks—While David, who, that day,"
10041,_RACHEL._,"Had left his ship at anchor in the bay,"
10042,_RACHEL._,"Had seen his friends who yet survived, and heard"
10043,_RACHEL._,Of her who loved him—and who thus appear’d—
10044,_RACHEL._,"He tried to soothe her, but retired afraid"
10045,_RACHEL._,"T’ approach, and left her to return for aid."
10046,_RACHEL._,“None came! and Rachel in the morn was found      }
10047,_RACHEL._,"Turning her wheel, without its spindles, round,      150}"
10048,_RACHEL._,"With household look of care, low singing to the sound.      }"
10049,_RACHEL._,"“Since that event, she is what you have seen;"
10050,_RACHEL._,"But time and habit make her more serene,"
10051,_RACHEL._,"The edge of anguish blunted—yet, it seems,"
10052,_RACHEL._,"Sea, ships, and sailors’ miseries are her dreams.”"

10059,_VILLARS._,_Poet._ Know you the fate of Villars?—
10060,_VILLARS._,_Friend._ What! the lad
10061,_VILLARS._,"At school so fond of solitude, and sad;"
10062,_VILLARS._,"Who broke our bounds because he scorn’d a guide,"
10063,_VILLARS._,And would walk lonely by the river’s side?—
10064,_VILLARS._,_P._ The same!—who rose at midnight to behold
10065,_VILLARS._,The moonbeams shedding their ethereal gold;
10066,_VILLARS._,"Who held our sports and pleasures in disgrace,"
10067,_VILLARS._,"For Guy of Warwick, and old Chevy Chase.—"
10068,_VILLARS._,"_F._ Who sought for friendships, gave his generous heart"
10069,_VILLARS._,"To every boy who chose to act the part,      10"
10070,_VILLARS._,Or judged he felt it—not aware that boys
10071,_VILLARS._,Have poor conceit of intellectual joys.
10072,_VILLARS._,"Theirs is no season for superfluous friends,"
10073,_VILLARS._,And none they need—but those whom Nature lends.—
10074,_VILLARS._,"_P._ But he, too, loved?—"
10075,_VILLARS._,"_F._ Oh, yes! his friend betray’d"
10076,_VILLARS._,The tender passion for the angel-maid.
10077,_VILLARS._,"Some child, whose features he at church had seen,"
10078,_VILLARS._,Became his bosom’s and his fancy’s queen;
10079,_VILLARS._,Some favourite look was on his mind impress’d—
10080,_VILLARS._,His warm and fruitful fondness gave the rest.—      20
10081,_VILLARS._,_P._ He left his father?—
10082,_VILLARS._,_F._ Yes! and rambled round
10083,_VILLARS._,The land on foot—I know not what he found.
10084,_VILLARS._,"Early he came to his paternal land,"
10085,_VILLARS._,And took the course he had in rambling plann’d.
10086,_VILLARS._,Ten years we lost him: he was then employ’d
10087,_VILLARS._,"In the wild schemes that he, perhaps, enjoy’d."
10088,_VILLARS._,"His mode of life, when he to manhood grew,"
10089,_VILLARS._,Was all his own—its shape disclosed to few.
10090,_VILLARS._,"Our grave, stern dames, who know the deeds of all,"
10091,_VILLARS._,Say that some damsels owe to him their fall;      30
10092,_VILLARS._,"And, though a Christian in his creed profess’d,"
10093,_VILLARS._,He had some heathen notions in his breast.
10094,_VILLARS._,"Yet we may doubt; for women, in his eyes,"
10095,_VILLARS._,"Were high and glorious, queens and deities;"
10096,_VILLARS._,"But he, perhaps, adorer and yet man,"
10097,_VILLARS._,"Transgress’d, yet worshipp’d. There are those who can."
10098,_VILLARS._,Near him a Widow’s mansion he survey’d—
10099,_VILLARS._,The lovely mother of a lovelier Maid;
10100,_VILLARS._,"Not great their wealth, though they were proud to claim"
10101,_VILLARS._,Alliance with a house of noblest name.      40
10102,_VILLARS._,"Now, had I skill, I would right fain devise"
10103,_VILLARS._,To bring the highborn spinster to your eyes.
10104,_VILLARS._,"I could discourse of lip, and chin, and cheek;"
10105,_VILLARS._,But you would see no picture as I speak.
10106,_VILLARS._,Such colours cannot—mix them as I may—
10107,_VILLARS._,Paint you this nymph—We’ll try a different way.
10108,_VILLARS._,"First take Calista in her glowing charms,"
10109,_VILLARS._,Ere yet she sank within Lothario’s arms—
10110,_VILLARS._,"Endued with beauties ripe, and large desires,"
10111,_VILLARS._,"And all that feels delight, and that inspires.      50"
10112,_VILLARS._,"Add Cleopatra’s great, yet tender, soul,"
10113,_VILLARS._,"Her boundless pride, her fondness of control,"
10114,_VILLARS._,"Her daring spirit, and her wily art,"
10115,_VILLARS._,"That, though it tortures, yet commands the heart;"
10116,_VILLARS._,"Add woman’s anger for a lover’s slight,"
10117,_VILLARS._,"And the revenge, that insult will excite;"
10118,_VILLARS._,"Add looks for veils, that she at will could wear,"
10119,_VILLARS._,"As Juliet fond, as Imogen sincere—"
10120,_VILLARS._,"Like Portia grave, sententious, and design’d"
10121,_VILLARS._,"For high affairs, or gay as Rosalind—      60"
10122,_VILLARS._,"Catch, if you can, some notion of the dame,"
10123,_VILLARS._,And let Matilda serve her for a name.
10124,_VILLARS._,"Think next how Villars saw th’ enchanting maid,"
10125,_VILLARS._,"And how he loved, pursued, adored, obey’d—"
10126,_VILLARS._,"Obey’d in all, except the dire command,"
10127,_VILLARS._,No more to dream of that bewitching hand.
10128,_VILLARS._,"His love provoked her scorn, his wealth she spurn’d,"
10129,_VILLARS._,"And frowns for praise, contempt for prayer return’d;"
10130,_VILLARS._,"But, proud yet shrewd, the wily sex despise"
10131,_VILLARS._,The would-be husband—yet the votary prize.      70
10132,_VILLARS._,"As Roman conquerors, of their triumph vain,"
10133,_VILLARS._,"Saw humbled monarchs in their pompous train,"
10134,_VILLARS._,"Who, when no more they swell’d the show of pride,"
10135,_VILLARS._,"In secret sorrow’d, or in silence died:"
10136,_VILLARS._,"So, when our friend adored the Beauty’s shrine,"
10137,_VILLARS._,"She mark’d the act, and gave the nod divine;"
10138,_VILLARS._,"And strove with scatter’d smiles, yet scarcely strove,"
10139,_VILLARS._,"To keep the lover, while she scorn’d his love."
10140,_VILLARS._,"These, and his hope, the doubtful man sustain’d;"
10141,_VILLARS._,For who that loves believes himself disdain’d?—      80
10142,_VILLARS._,"Each look, each motion, by his fondness read,"
10143,_VILLARS._,"Became Love’s food, and greater fondness bred;"
10144,_VILLARS._,"The pettiest favour was to him the sign,"
10145,_VILLARS._,"Of secret love, and said, “I’ll yet be thine!”"
10146,_VILLARS._,"One doleful year she held the captive swain,"
10147,_VILLARS._,"Who felt and cursed, and wore and bless’d, the chain;"
10148,_VILLARS._,"Who pass’d a thousand galling insults by,"
10149,_VILLARS._,For one kind glance of that ambiguous eye.
10150,_VILLARS._,"_P._ Well! time, perhaps, might to the coldest heart"
10151,_VILLARS._,Some gentle thought of one so fond impart;      90
10152,_VILLARS._,And pride itself has often favour shown
10153,_VILLARS._,"To what it governs, and can call its own."
10154,_VILLARS._,"_F._ Thus were they placed, when to the village came"
10155,_VILLARS._,"That lordly stranger, whom I need not name;"
10156,_VILLARS._,"Known since too well, but then as rich and young,"
10157,_VILLARS._,"Untried his prowess, and his crimes unsung."
10158,_VILLARS._,"Smooth was his speech, and show’d a gentle mind,      }"
10159,_VILLARS._,"Deaf to his praise, and to his merits blind,      }"
10160,_VILLARS._,"But raised by woman’s smile, and pleased with all mankind.      }"
10161,_VILLARS._,"At humble distance he this fair survey’d,      100"
10162,_VILLARS._,"Read her high temper, yet adored the Maid;"
10163,_VILLARS._,"Far off he gazed, as if afraid to meet,"
10164,_VILLARS._,Or show the hope her anger would defeat.
10165,_VILLARS._,"Awful his love, and kept a guarded way,"
10166,_VILLARS._,"Afraid to venture, till it finds it may."
10167,_VILLARS._,And soon it found! nor could the Lady’s pride
10168,_VILLARS._,"Her triumph bury, or her pleasure hide."
10169,_VILLARS._,"And jealous Love, that ever looks to spy"
10170,_VILLARS._,"The dreaded wandering of a lady’s eye,"
10171,_VILLARS._,"Perceived with anguish, that the prize long sought      110"
10172,_VILLARS._,A sudden rival from his hopes had caught.
10173,_VILLARS._,"Still Villars loved; at length, in strong despair,"
10174,_VILLARS._,O’er-tortured passion thus preferr’d its prayer:—
10175,_VILLARS._,“Life of my life! at once my fate decree—
10176,_VILLARS._,"I wait my death, or more than life, from thee."
10177,_VILLARS._,"I have no arts, nor powers, thy soul to move,"
10178,_VILLARS._,"But doting constancy, and boundless love;"
10179,_VILLARS._,"This is my all: had I the world to give,"
10180,_VILLARS._,Thine were its throne—now bid me die or live!”
10181,_VILLARS._,“Or die or live”—the gentle Lady cried—      120
10182,_VILLARS._,“As suits thee best; that point thyself decide!
10183,_VILLARS._,"But, if to death thou hast thyself decreed,"
10184,_VILLARS._,Then like a man perform the manly deed;
10185,_VILLARS._,"The well-charged pistol to the ear apply,"
10186,_VILLARS._,"Make loud report, and like a hero die!"
10187,_VILLARS._,Let rogues and rats on ropes and poison seize—
10188,_VILLARS._,Shame not thy friends by petty death like these;
10189,_VILLARS._,"Sure we must grieve at what thou think’st to do,"
10190,_VILLARS._,But spare us blushes for the manner too!”
10191,_VILLARS._,"Then with inviting smiles she turn’d aside,      130"
10192,_VILLARS._,"Allay’d his anger, and consoled his pride."
10193,_VILLARS._,Oft had the fickle fair beheld with scorn
10194,_VILLARS._,The unhappy man bewilder’d and forlorn;
10195,_VILLARS._,Then with one softening glance of those bright eyes
10196,_VILLARS._,"Restored his spirit, and dispersed his sighs."
10197,_VILLARS._,"Oft had I seen him on the lea below,"
10198,_VILLARS._,"As feelings moved him, walking quick or slow:"
10199,_VILLARS._,"Now a glad thought, and now a doleful came,"
10200,_VILLARS._,"And he adored or cursed the changeful dame,"
10201,_VILLARS._,Who was to him as cause is to effect—      140
10202,_VILLARS._,"Poor tool of pride, perverseness, and neglect!"
10203,_VILLARS._,Upon thy rival were her thoughts bestow’d;
10204,_VILLARS._,Ambitious love within her bosom glow’d;
10205,_VILLARS._,"And oft she wish’d, and strong was her desire,"
10206,_VILLARS._,The Lord could love her like the faithful Squire.
10207,_VILLARS._,But she was rivall’d in that noble breast—
10208,_VILLARS._,"He loved her passing well, but not the best;"
10209,_VILLARS._,"For self reign’d there; but still he call’d her fair,"
10210,_VILLARS._,"And woo’d the Muse, his passion to declare."
10211,_VILLARS._,"His verses all were flaming, all were fine,      150"
10212,_VILLARS._,"With sweetness, nay with sense, in every line—"
10213,_VILLARS._,"Not as Lord Byron would have done the thing,"
10214,_VILLARS._,But better far than lords are used to sing.
10215,_VILLARS._,"It pleased the Maid, and she, in very truth,"
10216,_VILLARS._,"Loved, in Calista’s love, the noble youth;"
10217,_VILLARS._,"Not, like sweet Juliet, with that pure delight,"
10218,_VILLARS._,"Fond and yet chaste, enraptur’d and yet right;"
10219,_VILLARS._,"Not like the tender Imogen, confined"
10220,_VILLARS._,"To one, but one! the true, the wedded mind;"
10221,_VILLARS._,"True, one preferr’d our sighing nymph as these,      160"
10222,_VILLARS._,"But thought not, like them, one alone could please."
10223,_VILLARS._,"Time pass’d, nor yet the youthful peer proposed"
10224,_VILLARS._,"To end his suit, nor his had Villars closed;"
10225,_VILLARS._,"Fond hints the one, the other cruel, bore;"
10226,_VILLARS._,"That was more cautious, this was kind the more:"
10227,_VILLARS._,"Both for soft moments waited—that, to take"
10228,_VILLARS._,"Of these advantage; fairly, this, to make."
10229,_VILLARS._,These moments came—or so my Lord believed—
10230,_VILLARS._,He dropp’d his mask; and both were undeceived.
10231,_VILLARS._,"She saw the vice that would no longer feign,      170"
10232,_VILLARS._,And he an angry beauty’s pure disdain.
10233,_VILLARS._,"Villars that night had in my ear confess’d,"
10234,_VILLARS._,He thought himself her spaniel and her jest.
10235,_VILLARS._,He saw his rival of his goddess sure;
10236,_VILLARS._,"“But then,” he cried, “her virtue is secure."
10237,_VILLARS._,"Should he offend, I haply may obtain"
10238,_VILLARS._,The high reward of vigilance and pain;
10239,_VILLARS._,"Till then I take, and on my bended knee,"
10240,_VILLARS._,"Scraps from the banquet, gleanings of the tree.”"
10241,_VILLARS._,"Pitying, I smiled; for I had known the time      180"
10242,_VILLARS._,Of Love insulted—constancy my crime.
10243,_VILLARS._,Not thus our friend: for him the morning shone
10244,_VILLARS._,"In tenfold glory, as for him alone;"
10245,_VILLARS._,"He wept, expecting still reproof to meet,"
10246,_VILLARS._,And all that was not cruel count as sweet.
10247,_VILLARS._,"Back he return’d, all eagerness and joy;"
10248,_VILLARS._,"Proud as a prince, and restless as a boy."
10249,_VILLARS._,"He sought to speak, but could not aptly find"
10250,_VILLARS._,"Words for his use, they enter’d not his mind;"
10251,_VILLARS._,"So full of bliss, that wonder and delight      190"
10252,_VILLARS._,Seem’d in those happy moments to unite.
10253,_VILLARS._,"He was like one who gains, but dreads to lose,"
10254,_VILLARS._,A prize that seems to vanish as he views;
10255,_VILLARS._,And in his look was wildness and alarm—
10256,_VILLARS._,"Like a sad conjuror, who forgets his charm"
10257,_VILLARS._,"And, when the demon at the call appears,"
10258,_VILLARS._,Cannot command the spirit for his fears:
10259,_VILLARS._,"So Villars seem’d by his own bliss perplex’d,"
10260,_VILLARS._,And scarcely knowing what would happen next.
10261,_VILLARS._,"But soon, a witness to their vows, I saw      200"
10262,_VILLARS._,"The maiden his, if not by love, by law;"
10263,_VILLARS._,The bells proclaim’d it—merry call’d by those
10264,_VILLARS._,Who have no foresight of their neighbours’ woes.
10265,_VILLARS._,"How proudly show’d the man his lovely bride,"
10266,_VILLARS._,"Demurely pacing, pondering, at his side!"
10267,_VILLARS._,"While all the loving maids around declared,"
10268,_VILLARS._,That faith and constancy deserved reward!
10269,_VILLARS._,The baffled Lord retreated from the scene
10270,_VILLARS._,"Of so much gladness, with a world of spleen;"
10271,_VILLARS._,"And left the wedded couple, to protest,      210}"
10272,_VILLARS._,"That he no fear, that she no love, possess’d;      }"
10273,_VILLARS._,"That all his vows were scorn’d, and all his hope a jest.      }"
10274,_VILLARS._,"Then fell the oaks, to let in light of day;"
10275,_VILLARS._,Then rose the mansion that we now survey;
10276,_VILLARS._,Then all the world flock’d gaily to the scene
10277,_VILLARS._,"Of so much splendour, and its splendid queen."
10278,_VILLARS._,"But, whether all within the gentle breast"
10279,_VILLARS._,"Of him, of her, was happy or at rest;"
10280,_VILLARS._,Whether no lonely sigh confess’d regret—
10281,_VILLARS._,"Was then unknown, and is a secret yet;      220"
10282,_VILLARS._,"And we may think, in common duty bound,"
10283,_VILLARS._,That no complaint is made where none is found.
10284,_VILLARS._,"Then came the Rival to his villa down,"
10285,_VILLARS._,Lost to the pleasures of the heartless town;
10286,_VILLARS._,"Famous he grew, and he invited all"
10287,_VILLARS._,Whom he had known to banquet at the Hall;
10288,_VILLARS._,"Talk’d of his love, and said, with many a sigh,"
10289,_VILLARS._,"“’Tis death to lose her, and I wish to die.”"
10290,_VILLARS._,Twice met the parties; but with cool disdain
10291,_VILLARS._,"In her, in him with looks of awe and pain.      230"
10292,_VILLARS._,"Villars had pity, and conceived it hard"
10293,_VILLARS._,That true regret should meet with no regard—
10294,_VILLARS._,"“Smile, my Matilda! virtue should inflict"
10295,_VILLARS._,"No needless pain, nor be so sternly strict.”"
10296,_VILLARS._,"The Hall was furnish’d in superior style,"
10297,_VILLARS._,And money wanted from our sister isle;
10298,_VILLARS._,The lady-mother to the husband sued—
10299,_VILLARS._,“Alas! that care should on our bliss intrude!
10300,_VILLARS._,You must to Ireland; our possessions there
10301,_VILLARS._,"Require your presence, nay, demand your care.      240"
10302,_VILLARS._,My pensive daughter begs with you to sail;
10303,_VILLARS._,"But spare your wife, nor let the wish prevail!”"
10304,_VILLARS._,"He went, and found upon his Irish land"
10305,_VILLARS._,Cases and griefs he could not understand.
10306,_VILLARS._,Some glimmering light at first his prospect cheer’d—
10307,_VILLARS._,"Clear it was not, but would in time be clear’d;"
10308,_VILLARS._,"But, when his lawyers had their efforts made,"
10309,_VILLARS._,No mind in man the darkness could pervade;
10310,_VILLARS._,’Twas palpably obscure: week after week
10311,_VILLARS._,"He sought for comfort, but was still to seek.      250"
10312,_VILLARS._,"At length, impatient to return, he strove"
10313,_VILLARS._,"No more with law, but gave the rein to love;"
10314,_VILLARS._,And to his Lady and their native shore
10315,_VILLARS._,"Vow’d to return, and thence to turn no more."
10316,_VILLARS._,"While yet on Irish ground in trouble kept,"
10317,_VILLARS._,The Husband’s terrors in his toils had slept;
10318,_VILLARS._,"But he no sooner touch’d the British soil,"
10319,_VILLARS._,Than jealous terrors took the place of toil—
10320,_VILLARS._,Where has she been? and how attended? Who
10321,_VILLARS._,"Has watch’d her conduct, and will vouch her true?      260"
10322,_VILLARS._,She sigh’d at parting; but methought her sighs
10323,_VILLARS._,Were more profound than would from nature rise;
10324,_VILLARS._,"And, though she wept as never wife before,"
10325,_VILLARS._,Yet were her eyelids neither swell’d nor sore.
10326,_VILLARS._,Her lady-mother has a good repute
10327,_VILLARS._,As watchful dragon of forbidden fruit;
10328,_VILLARS._,"Yet dragons sleep, and mothers have been known"
10329,_VILLARS._,To guard a daughter’s secret as their own;
10330,_VILLARS._,Nor can the absent in their travel see
10331,_VILLARS._,How a fond wife and mother may agree.      270
10332,_VILLARS._,"“Suppose the lady is most virtuous!—then,"
10333,_VILLARS._,What can she know of the deceits of men?
10334,_VILLARS._,"Of all they plan she neither thinks nor cares,"
10335,_VILLARS._,"But keeps, good lady! at her books and prayers."
10336,_VILLARS._,"“In all her letters there are love, respect,      }"
10337,_VILLARS._,"Esteem, regret, affection, all correct—      }"
10338,_VILLARS._,Too much—she fears that I should see neglect;      }
10339,_VILLARS._,"And there are fond expressions, but unlike"
10340,_VILLARS._,"The rest, as meant to be observed and strike;"
10341,_VILLARS._,"Like quoted words, they have the show of art,      280"
10342,_VILLARS._,And come not freely from the gentle heart—
10343,_VILLARS._,"Adopted words, and brought from memory’s store,"
10344,_VILLARS._,When the chill faltering heart supplies no more:
10345,_VILLARS._,"’Tis so the hypocrite pretends to feel,"
10346,_VILLARS._,"And speaks the words of earnestness and zeal,"
10347,_VILLARS._,"“Hers was a sudden, though a sweet consent;"
10348,_VILLARS._,May she not now as suddenly repent?
10349,_VILLARS._,My rival’s vices drove him from her door;
10350,_VILLARS._,But hates she vice as truly as before?
10351,_VILLARS._,"How do I know, if he should plead again,      290"
10352,_VILLARS._,That all her scorn and anger would remain?
10353,_VILLARS._,"“Oh, words of folly!—is it thus I deem"
10354,_VILLARS._,Of the chaste object of my fond esteem?
10355,_VILLARS._,Away with doubt! to jealousy adieu!
10356,_VILLARS._,"I know her fondness, and believe her true.—"
10357,_VILLARS._,"“Yet why that haste to furnish every need,"
10358,_VILLARS._,"And send me forth with comfort, and with speed?"
10359,_VILLARS._,Yes; for she dreaded that the winter’s rage
10360,_VILLARS._,And our frail hoy should on the seas engage.
10361,_VILLARS._,“But that vile girl! I saw a treacherous eye      300
10362,_VILLARS._,"Glance on her mistress! so demure and sly,"
10363,_VILLARS._,So forward too—and would Matilda’s pride
10364,_VILLARS._,"Admit of that, if there was nought beside?”"
10365,_VILLARS._,"Such, as he told me, were the doubt, the dread,"
10366,_VILLARS._,By jealous fears on observations fed.
10367,_VILLARS._,Home he proceeded: there remain’d to him
10368,_VILLARS._,But a few miles—the night was wet and dim;
10369,_VILLARS._,"Thick, heavy dews descended on the ground,"
10370,_VILLARS._,And all was sad and melancholy round.
10371,_VILLARS._,"While thinking thus, an inn’s far gleaming fire      310"
10372,_VILLARS._,Caused new emotions in the pensive Squire:
10373,_VILLARS._,"Here I may learn, and seeming careless too,"
10374,_VILLARS._,"If all is well, ere I my way pursue.—"
10375,_VILLARS._,"How fare you, landlord?—how, my friend, are all—"
10376,_VILLARS._,Have you not seen—my people at the Hall?
10377,_VILLARS._,"Well, I may judge?——”"
10378,_VILLARS._,"“Oh! yes, your Honour, well,"
10379,_VILLARS._,As Joseph knows; and he was sent to tell.”—
10380,_VILLARS._,"“How? sent?—I miss’d him—Joseph, do you say?"
10381,_VILLARS._,"Why sent, if well?—I miss’d him on the way.”"
10382,_VILLARS._,"There was a poacher on the chimney-seat,      320"
10383,_VILLARS._,"A gipsy, conjuror, smuggler, stroller, cheat."
10384,_VILLARS._,"The Squire had fined him for a captured hare,"
10385,_VILLARS._,"Whipp’d and imprison’d—he had felt the fare,"
10386,_VILLARS._,And he remember’d: “Will your Honour know
10387,_VILLARS._,How does my Lady? that myself can show.
10388,_VILLARS._,On Monday early—for your Honour sees
10389,_VILLARS._,"The poor man must not slumber at his ease,"
10390,_VILLARS._,"Nor must he into woods and coverts lurk,"
10391,_VILLARS._,"Nor work alone, but must be seen to work:"
10392,_VILLARS._,"’Tis not, your Honour knows, sufficient now      330"
10393,_VILLARS._,"For us to live, but we must prove it—how."
10394,_VILLARS._,"Stay, please your Honour—I was early up,"
10395,_VILLARS._,And forth without a morsel or a sup.
10396,_VILLARS._,There was my Lady’s carriage—Whew! it drove
10397,_VILLARS._,As if the horses had been spurr’d by Love.”
10398,_VILLARS._,"“A poet, John!” said Villars—feebly said,"
10399,_VILLARS._,"Confused with fear, and humbled and dismay’d—"
10400,_VILLARS._,"“And where this carriage?—but, my heart! enough—"
10401,_VILLARS._,Why do I listen to the villain’s stuff?—
10402,_VILLARS._,And where wert thou? and what the spur of thine      340
10403,_VILLARS._,That led thee forth?—we surely may divine!”
10404,_VILLARS._,"“Hunger, your Honour! I and my poor wife"
10405,_VILLARS._,Have now no other in our wane of life.
10406,_VILLARS._,"Were Phœbe handsome, and were I a Squire,"
10407,_VILLARS._,"I might suspect her, and young Lords admire.”—"
10408,_VILLARS._,"What, rascal!——”—“Nay, your Honour, on my word,"
10409,_VILLARS._,I should be jealous of that fine young Lord;
10410,_VILLARS._,"Yet him my Lady in the carriage took,"
10411,_VILLARS._,But innocent—I’d swear it on the book.”—
10412,_VILLARS._,"“You villain, swear!”—for still he wish’d to stay,      350"
10413,_VILLARS._,And hear what more the fellow had to say.—
10414,_VILLARS._,"“‘Phœbe,’ said I, ‘a rogue that had a heart"
10415,_VILLARS._,To do the deed would make his Honour smart.’—
10416,_VILLARS._,"Says Phœbe, wisely, ‘Think you, would he go,"
10417,_VILLARS._,"If he were jealous, from my Lady?—No.’”"
10418,_VILLARS._,"This was too much! poor Villars left the inn,"
10419,_VILLARS._,To end the grief that did but then begin.
10420,_VILLARS._,“With my Matilda in the coach!—what lies
10421,_VILLARS._,Will the vile rascal in his spleen devise?
10422,_VILLARS._,"Yet this is true, that on some vile pretence      360"
10423,_VILLARS._,Men may entrap the purest innocence.
10424,_VILLARS._,He saw my fears—alas! I am not free
10425,_VILLARS._,"From every doubt—but, no! it cannot be!”"
10426,_VILLARS._,"Villars moved slow, moved quick, as check’d by fear"
10427,_VILLARS._,"Or urged by Love, and drew his mansion near."
10428,_VILLARS._,"Light burst upon him, yet he fancied gloom,"
10429,_VILLARS._,Nor came a twinkling from Matilda’s room.—
10430,_VILLARS._,What then? ’tis idle to expect that all
10431,_VILLARS._,Should be produced at jealous fancy’s call;
10432,_VILLARS._,How! the park-gate wide open! who would dare      370
10433,_VILLARS._,"Do this, if her presiding glance were there?"
10434,_VILLARS._,"But yet, by chance—I know not what to think,"
10435,_VILLARS._,"For thought is hell, and I’m upon the brink!"
10436,_VILLARS._,"Not for a thousand worlds, ten thousand lives,"
10437,_VILLARS._,Would I——Oh! what depends upon our wives!
10438,_VILLARS._,"Pains, labours, terrors, all would I endure,"
10439,_VILLARS._,"Yes, all but this—and this, could I be sure——”"
10440,_VILLARS._,"Just then a light within the window shone,"
10441,_VILLARS._,"And show’d a lady, weeping and alone."
10442,_VILLARS._,"His heart beat fondly—on another view,      380"
10443,_VILLARS._,"It beat more strongly, and in terror too—"
10444,_VILLARS._,It was his Sister!—and there now appear’d
10445,_VILLARS._,"A servant, creeping like a man that fear’d."
10446,_VILLARS._,"He spoke with terror—“Sir, did Joseph tell?"
10447,_VILLARS._,Have you not met him?”—
10448,_VILLARS._,“Is your Lady well?”
10449,_VILLARS._,Well? Sir—your Honour——”
10450,_VILLARS._,“Heaven and earth! what mean
10451,_VILLARS._,"Your stupid questions? I have nothing seen,"
10452,_VILLARS._,"Nor heard, nor know, nor—Do, good Thomas, speak!"
10453,_VILLARS._,Your mistress——”
10454,_VILLARS._,"“Sir, has gone from home a week—"
10455,_VILLARS._,"My Lady, Sir, your sister”—— But, too late      390"
10456,_VILLARS._,Was this—my Friend had yielded to his fate.
10457,_VILLARS._,"He heard the truth, became serene and mild,"
10458,_VILLARS._,"Patient and still, as a corrected child;"
10459,_VILLARS._,At once his spirit with his fortune fell
10460,_VILLARS._,"To the last ebb, and whisper’d—‘It is well.’"
10461,_VILLARS._,Such was his fall; and grievous the effect!      }
10462,_VILLARS._,From henceforth all things fell into neglect—      }
10463,_VILLARS._,"The mind no more alert, the form no more erect.      }"
10464,_VILLARS._,"Villars long since, as he indulged his spleen"
10465,_VILLARS._,"By lonely travel on the coast, had seen      400"
10466,_VILLARS._,A large old mansion suffer’d to decay
10467,_VILLARS._,"In some law-strife, and slowly drop away."
10468,_VILLARS._,Dark elms around the constant herons bred;
10469,_VILLARS._,"Those the marsh dykes, the neighbouring ocean, fed;"
10470,_VILLARS._,"Rocks near the coast no shipping would allow,"
10471,_VILLARS._,And stubborn heath around forbad the plough;
10472,_VILLARS._,"Dull must the scene have been in years of old,"
10473,_VILLARS._,But now was wildly dismal to behold—
10474,_VILLARS._,"One level sadness! marsh, and heath, and sea,"
10475,_VILLARS._,"And, save these high dark elms, nor plant nor tree.      410"
10476,_VILLARS._,"In this bleak ruin Villars found a room,"
10477,_VILLARS._,"Square, small, and lofty—seat of grief and gloom."
10478,_VILLARS._,"A sloping skylight on the white wall threw,"
10479,_VILLARS._,"When the sun set, a melancholy hue;"
10480,_VILLARS._,"The Hall of Vathek has a room so bare,"
10481,_VILLARS._,"So small, so sad, so form’d to nourish care."
10482,_VILLARS._,"“Here,” said the Traveller, “all so dark within,"
10483,_VILLARS._,"And dull without, a man might mourn for sin,"
10484,_VILLARS._,Or punish sinners—here a wanton wife
10485,_VILLARS._,And vengeful husband might be cursed for life.”      420
10486,_VILLARS._,His mind was now in just that wretched state
10487,_VILLARS._,"That deems Revenge our right, and crime our fate."
10488,_VILLARS._,"All other views he banish’d from his soul,"
10489,_VILLARS._,And let this tyrant vex him and control;
10490,_VILLARS._,"Life he despised, and had that Lord defied,"
10491,_VILLARS._,But that he long’d for Vengeance e’er he died.
10492,_VILLARS._,"The law he spurn’d, the combat he declined,"
10493,_VILLARS._,And to his purpose all his soul resign’d.
10494,_VILLARS._,"Full fifteen months had pass’d, and we began"
10495,_VILLARS._,To have some hope of the returning man;      430
10496,_VILLARS._,Now to his steward of his small affairs
10497,_VILLARS._,"He wrote, and mention’d leases and repairs;"
10498,_VILLARS._,"But yet his soul was on its scheme intent,"
10499,_VILLARS._,And but a moment to his interest lent.
10500,_VILLARS._,His faithless wife and her triumphant peer
10501,_VILLARS._,"Despised his vengeance, and disdained to fear;"
10502,_VILLARS._,"In splendid lodgings near the town they dwelt,"
10503,_VILLARS._,"Nor fears from wrath, nor threats from conscience, felt."
10504,_VILLARS._,"Long time our friend had watch’d, and much had paid"
10505,_VILLARS._,"For vulgar minds, who lent his vengeance aid.      440"
10506,_VILLARS._,"At length one evening, late returning home,"
10507,_VILLARS._,"Thoughtless and fearless of the ills to come,"
10508,_VILLARS._,"The Wife was seized, when void of all alarm"
10509,_VILLARS._,And vainly trusting to a footman’s arm.
10510,_VILLARS._,"Death in his hand, the Husband stood in view,"
10511,_VILLARS._,"Commanding silence, and obedience too;"
10512,_VILLARS._,"Forced to his carriage, sinking at his side,"
10513,_VILLARS._,Madly he drove her—Vengeance was his guide.
10514,_VILLARS._,"All in that ruin Villars had prepared,"
10515,_VILLARS._,And meant her fate and sorrow to have shared;      450
10516,_VILLARS._,"There he design’d they should for ever dwell,"
10517,_VILLARS._,The weeping pair of a monastic cell.
10518,_VILLARS._,"An ancient couple from their cottage went,"
10519,_VILLARS._,"Won by his pay, to this imprisonment;"
10520,_VILLARS._,And all was order’d in his mind—the pain
10521,_VILLARS._,"He must inflict, the shame she must sustain;"
10522,_VILLARS._,"But such his gentle spirit, such his love,"
10523,_VILLARS._,The proof might fail of all he meant to prove.
10524,_VILLARS._,"Features so dear had still maintain’d their sway,"
10525,_VILLARS._,And looks so loved had taught him to obey;      460
10526,_VILLARS._,Rage and Revenge had yielded to the sight
10527,_VILLARS._,Of charms that waken wonder and delight;
10528,_VILLARS._,"The harsher passions from the heart had flown,"
10529,_VILLARS._,And LOVE regain’d his Subject and his Throne.

10539,THE FAREWELL AND RETURN,"to Mrs. Leadbetter, written in 1823, the poet says—“In my ‘Farewell and"

10633,II.,"Yes!—twenty years have pass’d, and I am come,"
10634,II.,"Unknown, unwelcomed, to my early home;"
10635,II.,"A stranger, striving in my walks to trace"
10636,II.,The youthful features in some aged face.
10637,II.,"On as I move, some curious looks I read;"
10638,II.,"We pause a moment, doubt, and then proceed."

10645,II.,They seem like me in doubt; but they can call
10646,II.,Their friends around them—I am lost to all.
10647,II.,The very place is alter’d. What I left
10648,II.,Seems of its space and dignity bereft:
10649,II.,"The streets are narrow, and the buildings mean;"
10650,II.,"Did I, or Fancy, leave them broad and clean?      80"
10651,II.,"The ancient church, in which I felt a pride,"
10652,II.,"As struck by magic, is but half as wide;"
10653,II.,"The tower is shorter, the sonorous bell"
10654,II.,Tells not the hour as it was wont to tell;
10655,II.,"The market dwindles, every shop and stall"
10656,II.,Sinks in my view; there’s littleness in all.
10657,II.,Mine is the error; prepossess’d I see;
10658,II.,And all the change I mourn is change in me.
10659,II.,One object only is the same; the sight
10660,II.,"Of the wide Ocean by the moon’s pale light,      90"
10661,II.,"With her long ray of glory, that we mark"
10662,II.,On the wild waves when all beside is dark.
10663,II.,"This is the work of Nature, and the eye"
10664,II.,In vain the boundless prospect would descry:
10665,II.,What mocks our view cannot contracted be;
10666,II.,We cannot lessen what we cannot see.
10667,II.,"Would I could now a single Friend behold,"
10668,II.,"Who would the yet mysterious facts unfold,"

10671,II.,"Much by myself I might in listening glean,"
10672,II.,"Mix’d with the crowd, unmark’d if not unseen;"

10681,II.,"I, as a ghost invisible, can stray"
10682,II.,"Among the crowd, and cannot lose my way;"

10687,II.,See I not One whom I before have seen?
10688,II.,"That face, though now untroubled and serene,"
10689,II.,"That air, though steady now, that look, though tame,"
10690,II.,"Pertain to one, whom, though I doubt to name,      120"
10691,II.,"Yet was he not a dashing youth and wild,"
10692,II.,"Proud as a man, and haughty when a child?"
10693,II.,"Talents were his; he was in nature kind,"
10694,II.,"With lofty, strong, and independent mind;"
10695,II.,"His father wealthy, but, in very truth,"

10698,II.,Told how his father’s money he would sport.
10699,II.,Yet in his dress and manner now appears
10700,II.,No sign of faults that stain’d his earlier years;      130

10703,II.,"Such as to ruin leads!—I may mistake,"

10705,II.,"He looks as one whom I should not offend,"
10706,II.,Address’d as him whom I would make a friend.
10707,II.,Men with respect attend him.—He proceeds
10708,II.,"To yonder public room—why, then he reads!"
10709,II.,Suppose me right—a mighty change is wrought;
10710,II.,But Time ere now has care and caution taught.      140
10711,II.,"May I address him? And yet, why afraid?      }"
10712,II.,"Deny he may, but he will not upbraid;      }"

10735,II.,Of living men; and memory then will trace

10737,II.,As they were borne to their last quiet homes—

11174,II.,"But ’tis that he may for my wrongs be paid,"
11175,II.,And feel the vengeance of the wretch he made.      130
11176,II.,“Not for myself I thy attention claim      }
11177,II.,My children dare not take their father’s name;      }
11178,II.,They know no parent’s love—love will not dwell with shame.      }
11179,II.,"What law would force, he not without it gives,"
11180,II.,"And hates each living wretch, because it lives!"
11181,II.,"Yet, with these sinful stains, the man is mine:      }"
11182,II.,How will he curse me for this rash design!      }
11183,II.,"Yes—I will bear his curse, but him will not resign.      }"
11184,II.,"“I see thee grieved; but, Lady, what thy grief?"
11185,II.,"It may be pungent, but it must be brief.      140"
11186,II.,"Pious thou art; but what will profit thee,"
11187,II.,"Match’d with a demon, woman’s piety?"
11188,II.,"Not for thy sake my wrongs and wrath I tell,"
11189,II.,"Revenge I seek! but yet, I wish thee well."
11190,II.,"And now I leave thee! Thou art warn’d by one,"
11191,II.,The rock on which her peace was wreck’d to shun.”
11192,II.,The Lover heard; but not in time to stay
11193,II.,A woman’s vengeance in its headlong way.
11194,II.,"Yet he essay’d, with no unpractised skill,"
11195,II.,"To warp the judgment, or at least the will;      150"
11196,II.,"To raise such tumults in the poor weak heart,"
11197,II.,"That Jane, believing all—yet should not dare to part."
11198,II.,But there was Virtue in her mind that strove
11199,II.,"With all his eloquence, and all her love;"
11200,II.,"He told what hope and frailty dared to tell,"
11201,II.,And all was answered by a stern _Farewell_!
11202,II.,Home with his consort he returned once more;
11203,II.,And they resumed the life they led before.
11204,II.,"Not so our maiden. She, before resign’d,      }"
11205,II.,Had now the anguish of a wounded mind—      160}
11206,II.,And felt the languid grief that the deserted find.      }
11207,II.,"On him she had reposed each worldly view,"
11208,II.,"And when he fail’d, the world itself withdrew,"
11209,II.,With all its prospects. Nothing could restore
11210,II.,To life its value; hope would live no more:
11211,II.,"Pensive by nature, she can not sustain"
11212,II.,The sneer of pity that the heartless feign;

11214,II.,"A quiet victim, and a patient prey;"
11215,II.,"The one bright view that she had cherish’d dies,      170"
11216,II.,And other hope must from the future rise.
11217,II.,"She still extends to grief and want her aid,"

11219,II.,Death is her soul’s relief; to him she flies

11339,II.,"When beams of golden light are shed around,"
11340,II.,And sweet is every night and every sound.
11341,II.,"Pass but this hill, and I shall then behold"
11342,II.,"The Seat so honour’d, no admired of old,"
11343,II.,And yet admired——
11344,II.,"Alas! I see a change,"
11345,II.,"Of odious kind, and lamentably strange."
11346,II.,Who had done this? The good old Lady lies      110
11347,II.,"Within her tomb; but, who could this advise?"
11348,II.,"What barbarous hand could all this mischief do,"
11349,II.,"And spoil a noble house, to make it new?"
11350,II.,Who had done this? Some genuine Son of Trade
11351,II.,Has all this dreadful devastation made;
11352,II.,"Some man with line and rule, and evil eye,"
11353,II.,"Who could no beauty in a tree descry,"
11354,II.,"Save in a clump, when stationed by his hand,"
11355,II.,And standing where his genius bade them stand;
11356,II.,"Some true admirer of the time’s reform,      120"
11357,II.,Who strips an ancient dwelling like a storm;
11358,II.,"Strips it of all its dignity and grace,"
11359,II.,To put his own dear fancies in their place.
11360,II.,He hates concealment: all that was enclosed
11361,II.,"By venerable wood is now exposed,"
11362,II.,"And a few stripling elms all oaks appear,"
11363,II.,"Fenced round by boards, to keep them from the deer."
11364,II.,"I miss the grandeur of the rich old scene,"
11365,II.,And see not what these clumps and patches mean!
11366,II.,This shrubby belt that runs the land around      130
11367,II.,Shuts freedom out! what being likes a bound?
11368,II.,"The shrubs indeed, and ill-placed flowers, are gay,      }"
11369,II.,"And some would praise; I wish they were away,      }"
11370,II.,That in the wild-wood maze I as of old might stray.      }
11371,II.,"The things themselves are pleasant to behold,"
11372,II.,But not like those which we beheld of old—
11373,II.,"That half-hid mansion, with its wide domain,      }"
11374,II.,Unbound and unsubdued!—but sighs are vain;      }
11375,II.,It is the rage of Taste—the rule and compass reign.      }
11376,II.,"As thus my spleen upon the view I fed,      140"
11377,II.,"A man approach’d me, by his grandchild led—"
11378,II.,"A blind old man, and she a fair young maid,"
11379,II.,Listening in love to what her grandsire said.
11380,II.,
11381,II.,And thus with gentle voice he spoke—
11382,II.,"“Come lead me, lassie, to the shade,"
11383,II.,Where willows grow beside the brook;
11384,II.,"For well I know the sound it made,"
11385,II.,"When, dashing o’er the stony rill,"
11386,II.,It murmur’d to St. Osyth’s Mill.”
11387,II.,
11388,II.,"The Lass replied—“The trees are fled,      150"
11389,II.,They’ve cut the brook a straighter bed:
11390,II.,"No shades the present lords allow,"
11391,II.,The miller only murmurs now;
11392,II.,"The waters now his mill forsake,"
11393,II.,And form a pond they call a lake.”—
11394,II.,
11395,II.,"“Then, lassie, lead thy grandsire on,"
11396,II.,And to the holy water bring;
11397,II.,"A cup is fasten’d to the stone,"
11398,II.,"And I would taste the healing spring,"
11399,II.,"That soon its rocky cist forsakes,      160"
11400,II.,And green its mossy passage makes.”—
11401,II.,
11402,II.,"“The holy spring is turn’d aside,"
11403,II.,"The rock is gone, the stream is dried;"
11404,II.,"The plough has levell’d all around,"
11405,II.,And here is now no holy ground.”—
11406,II.,
11407,II.,"“Then, lass, thy grandsire’s footsteps guide"
11408,II.,"To Bulmer’s Tree, the giant oak,"
11409,II.,"Whose boughs the keeper’s cottage hide,"
11410,II.,And part the church-way lane o’erlook;
11411,II.,"A boy, I climb’d the topmost bough,      170"
11412,II.,And I would feel its shadow now!
11413,II.,
11414,II.,"“Or, lassie, lead me to the west,"
11415,II.,"Where grew the elm-trees thick and tall,"
11416,II.,Where rooks unnumber’d build their nest—
11417,II.,"Deliberate birds, and prudent all:"
11418,II.,"Their notes, indeed, are harsh and rude,"
11419,II.,But they’re a social multitude.”
11420,II.,
11421,II.,"“The rooks are shot, the trees are fell’d,"
11422,II.,And nest and nursery all expell’d;
11423,II.,"With better fate the giant-tree,      180"
11424,II.,"Old Bulmer’s Oak, is gone to sea."
11425,II.,"The church-way walk is now no more,"
11426,II.,And men must other ways explore;
11427,II.,"Though this indeed promotion gains,"
11428,II.,For this the park’s new wall contains;
11429,II.,And here I fear we shall not meet
11430,II.,"A shade—although, perchance, a seat.”"
11431,II.,"“O then, my lassie, lead the way"
11432,II.,"To Comfort’s Home, the ancient inn:"
11433,II.,"That something holds, if we can pay—      190"
11434,II.,Old David is our living kin;
11435,II.,"A servant once, he still preserves"
11436,II.,"His name, and in his office serves.”"
11437,II.,
11438,II.,“Alas! that mine should be the fate
11439,II.,Old David’s sorrows to relate!
11440,II.,But they were brief; not long before
11441,II.,"He died, his office was no more."
11442,II.,"The kennel stands upon the ground,"
11443,II.,With something of the former sound.”
11444,II.,
11445,II.,"“O then,” the grieving Man replied,      200"
11446,II.,"“No further, lassie, let me stray;"
11447,II.,"Here’s nothing left of ancient pride,"
11448,II.,"Of what was grand, of what was gay;"
11449,II.,"But all is chang’d, is lost, is sold—"
11450,II.,"All, all that’s left is chilling cold."
11451,II.,I seek for comfort here in vain;
11452,II.,Then lead me to my cot again!”

11467,I.,"To doubt his memory—“Ha! your name, my friend?”"
11468,I.,He is the master of these things we see:
11469,I.,Those vessels proudly riding by the quay;

11486,I.,"Speaking in tone so high, as if the ware"

11588,II.,"He tells of wonders, by his bounty plann’d;"
11589,II.,"Tells of his traffic, where his vessels sail’d,"
11590,II.,And what a trade he drove—before he fail’d;
11591,II.,"Then what a failure, not a paltry sum,"
11592,II.,"Like a mean trader, but for half a plum;"
11593,II.,His Lady’s wardrobe was apprised so high
11594,II.,"At his own sale, that nobody would buy!—"

12062,II.,"He thinks of propping elms and clasping vines,"
12063,II.,And in her weakness thinks her virtue shines;
12064,II.,"On him not one of her desires is lost,"
12065,II.,And he admires her for this care and cost.
12066,II.,"But, when afflictions come, when beauty dies,      150"
12067,II.,"Or sorrows vex the heart, or danger tries—"
12068,II.,"When time of trouble brings the daily care,"

12077,II.,For some indulgence he cannot supply—
12078,II.,"When, in the midst of many a care, his “dear”"
12079,II.,"Would like a duchess at a ball appear,"

12093,I.,I.
12094,I.,
12095,I.,"Of all the beauties in our favour’d place,"
12096,I.,BELINDA WATERS was the pride and grace.
12097,I.,"Say ye, who sagely can our fortunes read,"
12098,I.,Shall this fair damsel in the world succeed?
12099,I.,"A rosy beauty she, and fresh and fair,"
12100,I.,Who never felt a caution or a care;
12101,I.,"Gentle by nature, ever fond of ease,"
12102,I.,And more consenting than inclined to please.
12103,I.,A tame good nature in her spirit lives—
12104,I.,She hates refusal for the pain it gives:      10
12105,I.,"From opposition arguments arise,"
12106,I.,"And, to prevent the trouble, she complies."
12107,I.,"She, if in Scotland, would be _fash’d_ all day,"
12108,I.,If call’d to any work or any play;
12109,I.,"She lets no busy, idle wish intrude,"
12110,I.,But is by nature negatively good.
12111,I.,In marriage hers will be a dubious fate:
12112,I.,She is not fitted for a high estate—
12113,I.,"There wants the grace, the polish, and the pride;      }"
12114,I.,Less is she fitted for a humble bride:      20}
12115,I.,Whom fair Belinda weds—let chance decide!      }
12116,I.,"She sees her father oft engross’d by cares,"
12117,I.,And therefore hates to hear of men’s affairs.
12118,I.,"An active mother in the household reigns,"
12119,I.,And spares Belinda all domestic pains;
12120,I.,"Of food she knows but this, that we are fed;"
12121,I.,"Though, duly taught, she prays for daily bread,"
12122,I.,"Yet, whence it comes, of hers is no concern—"
12123,I.,It comes; and more she never wants to learn.
12124,I.,"She on the table sees the common fare,      30"
12125,I.,"But, how provided, is beneath her care."
12126,I.,"Lovely and useless, she has no concern"
12127,I.,About the things that aunts and mothers learn;
12128,I.,"But thinks, when married—if she thinks at all—"
12129,I.,That what she needs will answer to her call.
12130,I.,"To write is business, and, though taught to write,"
12131,I.,She keeps the pen and paper out of sight;
12132,I.,What once was painful she cannot allow
12133,I.,To be enjoyment or amusement now.
12134,I.,She wonders why the ladies are so fond      40
12135,I.,"Of such long letters, when they correspond;"
12136,I.,"Crowded and cross’d by ink of different stain,"
12137,I.,She thinks to read them would confuse her brain;
12138,I.,Nor much mistakes; but still has no pretence
12139,I.,"To praise for this, her critic’s indolence."
12140,I.,Behold her now! she on her sofa looks
12141,I.,O’er half a shelf of circulating books.
12142,I.,"This she admired, but she forgets the name,"
12143,I.,"And reads again another, or the same."
12144,I.,"She likes to read of strange and bold escapes,      50}"
12145,I.,"Of plans and plottings, murders and mishaps,      }"
12146,I.,"Love in all hearts, and lovers in all shapes.      }"
12147,I.,"She sighs for pity, and her sorrows flow"
12148,I.,From the dark eyelash on the page below;
12149,I.,"And is so glad when, all the misery past,"
12150,I.,The dear adventurous lovers meet at last—
12151,I.,"Meet and are happy; and she thinks it hard,"
12152,I.,When thus an author might a pair reward—
12153,I.,"When they, the troubles all dispersed, might wed—"
12154,I.,"He makes them part, and die of grief instead!      60"
12155,I.,"Yet tales of terror are her dear delight,"
12156,I.,All in the wintry storm to read at night;
12157,I.,"And to her maid she turns in all her doubt,—"
12158,I.,“This shall I like? and what is that about?”
12159,I.,She had “Clarissa” for her heart’s dear friend—
12160,I.,Was pleased each well-tried virtue to commend.
12161,I.,And praised the scenes that one might fairly doubt
12162,I.,If one so young could know so much about.
12163,I.,"Pious and pure, th’ heroic beauty strove"
12164,I.,Against the lover and against the love;      70
12165,I.,"But strange that maid so young should know the strife,"
12166,I.,"In all its views, was painted to the life!"
12167,I.,"Belinda knew not—nor a tale would read,"
12168,I.,That could so slowly on its way proceed;
12169,I.,"And, ere Clarissa reach’d the wicked town,"
12170,I.,The weary damsel threw the volume down.
12171,I.,"“Give me,” she said, “for I would laugh or cry,"
12172,I.,"‘Scenes from the Life,’ and ‘Sensibility;’"
12173,I.,"‘Winters at Bath,’—I would that I had one!      }"
12174,I.,"‘The Constant Lover,’ the ‘Discarded Son,’      80}"
12175,I.,"‘The Rose of Raby,’ ‘Delmore,’ or ‘The Nun.’      }"
12176,I.,"These promise something, and may please, perhaps,"
12177,I.,"Like ‘Ethelinda,’ and the dear ‘Relapse.’”"
12178,I.,"To these her heart the gentle maid resign’d,"
12179,I.,And such the food that fed the gentle mind.
12180,I.,
12181,I.,
12182,II.,II.
12183,II.,
12184,II.,"_P._ Knew you the fair BELINDA, once the boast"
12185,II.,"Of a vain mother, and a favourite toast"
12186,II.,"Of clerks and young lieutenants, a gay set"
12187,II.,Of light admirers?—Is she married yet?
12188,II.,"_F._ Yes! she is married; though she waited long,      90"
12189,II.,"Not from a prudent fear of choosing wrong,"
12190,II.,"But want of choice.—She took a surgeon’s mate,"
12191,II.,"With his half-pay, that was his whole estate."
12192,II.,Fled is the charming bloom that nature spread      }
12193,II.,"Upon her cheek, the pure, the rosy red—      }"
12194,II.,"This, and the look serene, the calm, kind look, are fled.      }"
12195,II.,"Sorrow and sadness now the place possess,"
12196,II.,And the pale cast of anxious fretfulness.
12197,II.,"She _wonders_ much—as, why they live so ill;"
12198,II.,Why the rude butcher brings his weekly bill;      100
12199,II.,"She wonders why that baker will not trust,"
12200,II.,"And says, most truly says,—“Indeed, he must.”"
12201,II.,She wonders where her former friends are gone—
12202,II.,"And thus, from day to day, she wonders on."
12203,II.,"Howe’er she can—she dresses gaily yet,"
12204,II.,And then she wonders how they came in debt.
12205,II.,"Her husband loves her, and in accent mild"
12206,II.,"Answers, and treats her like a fretted child;"
12207,II.,"But when he, ruffled, makes severe replies,      }"
12208,II.,"And seems unhappy—then she pouts, and cries      110}"
12209,II.,"“She wonders when she’ll die!”—She faints, but never dies.      }"
12210,II.,"“How well my father lived!” she says.—“How well,"
12211,II.,"My dear, your father’s creditors could tell!”"
12212,II.,"And then she weeps, till comfort is applied,"
12213,II.,That soothes her spleen or gratifies her pride:
12214,II.,"Her dress and novels, visits and success"
12215,II.,"In a chance-game, are soft’ners of distress."
12216,II.,"So life goes on!—But who, that loved his life,"
12217,II.,Would take a fair Belinda for his wife!
12218,II.,"Who thinks that all are for their stations born,      120"
12219,II.,"Some to indulge themselves, and to adorn;"
12220,II.,"And some, a useful people, to prepare,"
12221,II.,"Not being rich, good things for those who are,"
12222,II.,"And who are born, it cannot be denied,"
12223,II.,To have their wants and their demands supplied.
12224,II.,"She knows that money is a needful thing,"
12225,II.,"That fathers first, and then that husbands bring;"
12226,II.,"Or, if those persons should the aid deny,"
12227,II.,"Daughters and wives have but to faint and die,"
12228,II.,Till flesh and blood cannot endure the pain;      130
12229,II.,And then the lady lives and laughs again.
12230,II.,"To wed an ague, and to feel, for life,"
12231,II.,Hot fits and cold succeeding in a wife;
12232,II.,"To take the pestilence with poison’d breath,"
12233,II.,"And wed some potent minister of death,"
12234,II.,Is cruel fate—yet death is then relief;
12235,II.,But thus to wed is ever-during grief.
12236,II.,"Oft have I heard, how blest the youth who weds"
12237,II.,Belinda Waters!—rather he who dreads
12238,II.,"That fate—a truth her husband well approves,      140"
12239,II.,"Who blames and fondles, humours, chides, and loves."

12246,_THE DEALER AND CLERK._,
12247,I.,I.
12248,I.,
12249,I.,Bad men are seldom cheerful; but we see
12250,I.,"That, when successful, they can merry be."
12251,I.,"ONE, whom I leave, his darling money lends,"
12252,I.,"On terms well known, to his unhappy friends;"
12253,I.,"He farms and trades, and in his method treats"
12254,I.,"His guests, whom first he comforts, then he cheats."
12255,I.,"He knows their private griefs, their inward groans,"
12256,I.,And then applies his leeches and his loans
12257,I.,"To failing, falling families—and gets,"
12258,I.,"I know not how, with large increase, their debts.      10"
12259,I.,"He early married, and the woman made"
12260,I.,A losing bargain; she with scorn was paid
12261,I.,For no small fortune. On this slave he vents
12262,I.,"His peevish slights, his moody discontents."
12263,I.,"Her he neglects, indulging, in her stead,"
12264,I.,One whom he bribed to leave a husband’s bed—
12265,I.,"A young fair mother too, the pride and joy"
12266,I.,Of him whom her desertion will destroy.
12267,I.,"The poor man walks by the adulterer’s door,"
12268,I.,"To see the wife, whom he must meet no more;      20"
12269,I.,She will not look upon the face of one
12270,I.,"Whom she has blighted, ruined, and undone."
12271,I.,He feels the shame; his heart with grief is rent;
12272,I.,"Hers is the guilt, and his the punishment."
12273,I.,The cruel spoiler to his need would lend
12274,I.,Unsought relief—his need will soon have end.
12275,I.,"Let a few wint’ry months in sorrow pass,"
12276,I.,And on his corse shall grow the vernal grass.
12277,I.,"Neighbours, indignant, of his griefs partake,"
12278,I.,And hate the villain for the victim’s sake;      30
12279,I.,Wond’ring what bolt within the stores of heaven
12280,I.,"Shall on that bold, offending wretch be driven."
12281,I.,"Alas! my grieving friends, we cannot know"
12282,I.,"Why Heaven inflicts, and why suspends, the blow."
12283,I.,"Meanwhile the godless man, who thus destroys"
12284,I.,"Another’s peace, in peace his wealth enjoys,"
12285,I.,"And, every law evaded or defied,"
12286,I.,Is with long life and prosperous fortune tried.
12287,I.,"“How long?” the Prophet cried, and we, “how long?”      }"
12288,I.,"But think how quick that Eye, that Arm how strong,      40}"
12289,I.,"And bear what seems not right, and trust it is not wrong!      }"
12290,I.,Does Heaven forbear? then sinners mercy find—
12291,I.,Do sinners fall? ’tis mercy to mankind.
12292,I.,"ADIEU! can one so miserable be,"
12293,I.,"Rich, wretched man, to barter fates with thee?"
12294,I.,
12295,I.,
12296,II.,II.
12297,II.,
12298,II.,"Yet, ere I go, some notice must be paid"
12299,II.,"To JOHN, his Clerk, a man full sore afraid"
12300,II.,Of his own frailty—many a troubled day
12301,II.,"Has he walk’d doubtful in some close by-way,"
12302,II.,"Beseeching Conscience on her watch to keep,      50"
12303,II.,Afraid that she one day should fall asleep.
12304,II.,A quiet man was John; his mind was slow;
12305,II.,"Little he knew, and little sought to know."
12306,II.,"He gave respect to worth, to riches more,"
12307,II.,And had instinctive dread of being poor.
12308,II.,"Humble and careful, diligent and neat,"
12309,II.,He in the Dealer’s office found a seat;
12310,II.,"Happy in all things, till a fear began"
12311,II.,"To break his rest—He served a wicked man,"
12312,II.,"Who spurn’d the way direct of honest trade,      60"
12313,II.,But praised the laws his cunning could evade.
12314,II.,"This crafty Dealer of religion spoke,"
12315,II.,"As if design’d to be the wise man’s cloak,"
12316,II.,"And the weak man’s encumbrance, whom it awes,"
12317,II.,And keeps in dread of conscience and the laws.
12318,II.,"Yet, for himself, he loved not to appear"
12319,II.,In her grave dress; ’twas troublesome to wear.
12320,II.,"This Dealer played at games of skill, and won"
12321,II.,Sums that surprised the simple mind of John;
12322,II.,"Nor trusted skill alone; for well he knew,      70"
12323,II.,What a sharp eye and dext’rous hand could do;
12324,II.,"When, if suspected, he had always by"
12325,II.,The daring oath to back the cunning lie.
12326,II.,"John was distress’d, and said, with aching heart,"
12327,II.,"“I from the vile, usurious man must part;"
12328,II.,"For, if I go not—yet I mean to go—"
12329,II.,This friend to me will to my soul be foe.
12330,II.,I serve my master: there is nought to blame;
12331,II.,"But, whom he serves, I tremble but to name.”"
12332,II.,From such reflections sprung the painful fear—      80
12333,II.,“The Foe of Souls is too familiar here;
12334,II.,"My master stands between: so far, so good;"
12335,II.,But ’tis at best a dangerous neighbourhood.”
12336,II.,Then livelier thoughts began this fear to chase—
12337,II.,"“It is a gainful, a convenient place."
12338,II.,"If I should quit—another takes the pen,"
12339,II.,And what a chance for my preferment then?
12340,II.,Religion nothing by my going gains;
12341,II.,"If I depart, my master still remains."
12342,II.,"True, I record the deeds that I abhor,      90"
12343,II.,But these that master has to answer for.
12344,II.,"Then say, I leave the office: his success,"
12345,II.,"And his injustice, will not be the less;"
12346,II.,"Nay, would be greater—I am right to stay;"
12347,II.,"It checks him, doubtless, in his fearful way."
12348,II.,"Fain would I stay, and yet be not beguiled;"
12349,II.,"But pitch is near, and man is soon defiled.”"
12350,II.,
12351,II.,
12352,III.,III.
12353,III.,
12354,III.,_P._ Such were the MAN and MASTER—and I now
12355,III.,"Would know if they together live, and how."
12356,III.,"To such enquiries, thus my Friend replied:—      100"
12357,III.,"_F._ The Wife was slain—or, say at least, she died."
12358,III.,But there are murders that the human eye
12359,III.,Cannot detect—which human laws defy.
12360,III.,"There are the wrongs insulted fondness feels,"
12361,III.,In many a secret wound that never heals;
12362,III.,The Savage murders with a single blow;
12363,III.,Murders like this are secret and are slow.
12364,III.,"Yet, when his victim lay upon her bier,"
12365,III.,There were who witness’d that he dropt a tear;
12366,III.,"Nay, more, he praised the woman he had lost,      110"
12367,III.,And undisputed paid the funeral cost.
12368,III.,"The Favourite now, her lord and master freed,"
12369,III.,"Prepared to wed, and be a wife indeed."
12370,III.,"The day, ’twas said, was fix’d, the robes were bought,"
12371,III.,"A feast was order’d; but a cold was caught,"
12372,III.,"And pain ensued, with fever—grievous pain,"
12373,III.,With the mind’s anguish that disturb’d the brain—
12374,III.,"Till nature ceased to struggle, and the mind"
12375,III.,"Saw clearly death before, and sin behind."
12376,III.,Priests and physicians gave what they could give;      120
12377,III.,"She turn’d away, and, shuddering, ceased to live."
12378,III.,The Dealer now appeared awhile as one
12379,III.,"Lost, with but little of his race to run,"
12380,III.,"And that in sorrow; men with one consent,"
12381,III.,"And one kind hope, said, “Bonner will repent.”"
12382,III.,"Alas! we saw not what his fate would be,"
12383,III.,But this we fear’d—no penitence had he;
12384,III.,"Nor time for penitence, nor any time,"
12385,III.,"So quick the summons, to look back on crime."
12386,III.,"When he the partner of his sin entomb’d,      130"
12387,III.,"He paused awhile, and then the way resumed,"
12388,III.,Ev’n as before; yet was he not the same:
12389,III.,"The tempter once, he now the dupe became."
12390,III.,"John long had left him, nor did one remain"
12391,III.,Who would his harlot in her course refrain;
12392,III.,"Obsequious, humble, studious of his ease,"
12393,III.,The present Phœbe only sought to please.
12394,III.,"“With one so artless, what,” said he, “to fear,"
12395,III.,"Or what to doubt, in one who holds me dear?"
12396,III.,"Friends she may have, but me she will not wrong;      140"
12397,III.,"If weak her judgment, yet her love is strong;"
12398,III.,And I am lucky now in age to find
12399,III.,"A friend so trusty, and a nurse so kind.”"
12400,III.,Yet neither party was in peace; the man
12401,III.,"Had restless nights, and in the morn began"
12402,III.,To cough and tremble; he was hot and cold—
12403,III.,"He had a nervous fever, he was told."
12404,III.,"His dreams—’twas strange, for none reflected less"
12405,III.,On his past life—were frightful to excess;
12406,III.,"His favourite dinners were no more enjoy’d,      150"
12407,III.,"And, in a word, his spirits were destroy’d."
12408,III.,And what of Phœbe? She her measures plann’d;
12409,III.,All but his money was at her command;
12410,III.,"All would be hers, when Heav’n her Friend should call;"
12411,III.,"But Heav’n was slow, and much she long’d for all:—"
12412,III.,"“Mine when he dies, mean wretch! and why not mine,"
12413,III.,When it would prove him generous to resign
12414,III.,"What he enjoys not!”—Phœbe, at command,"
12415,III.,Gave him his brandy with a liberal hand.
12416,III.,"A way more quick and safe she did not know,      160"
12417,III.,"And brandy, though it might be sure, was slow."
12418,III.,But more she dared not; for she felt a dread
12419,III.,"Of being tried, and only wish’d him dead."
12420,III.,Such was her restless strife of hope and fear—
12421,III.,He might cough on for many a weary year;
12422,III.,"Nay, his poor mind was changing, and, when ill,      }"
12423,III.,Some foe to her may wicked thoughts instil!      }
12424,III.,Oh! ’tis a trial sore to watch a Miser’s will!      }
12425,III.,"Thus, though the pair appear’d in peace to live,"
12426,III.,They felt that vice has not that peace to give.      170
12427,III.,There watch’d a cur before the Miser’s gate—
12428,III.,"A very cur, whom all men seem’d to hate;"
12429,III.,"Gaunt, savage, shaggy, with an eye that shone"
12430,III.,"Like a live coal, and he possess’d but one;"
12431,III.,"His bark was wild and eager, and became      }"
12432,III.,That meagre body and that eye of flame;      }
12433,III.,"His master prized him much, and _Fang_ his name.      }"
12434,III.,"His master fed him largely; but not that,"
12435,III.,"Nor aught of kindness, made the snarler fat."
12436,III.,"Flesh he devoured, but not a bit would stay;      180"
12437,III.,"He bark’d, and snarl’d, and growl’d it all away."
12438,III.,"His ribs were seen extended like a rack,"
12439,III.,And coarse red hair hung roughly o’er his back.
12440,III.,"Lamed in one leg, and bruised in wars of yore,"
12441,III.,Now his sore body made his temper sore.
12442,III.,"Such was the friend of him, who could not find,"
12443,III.,"Nor make him one, ‘mong creatures of his kind."
12444,III.,"Brave deeds of Fang his master often told,"
12445,III.,"The son of Fury, famed in days of old,"
12446,III.,From Snatch and Rabid sprung; and noted they      190
12447,III.,In earlier times—each dog will have his day.
12448,III.,"The notes of Fang were to his master known,"
12449,III.,And dear—they bore some likeness to his own;
12450,III.,"For both convey’d to the experienced ear,"
12451,III.,"“I snarl and bite, because I hate and fear.”"
12452,III.,None pass’d ungreeted by the master’s door;
12453,III.,"Fang rail’d at all, but chiefly at the poor;"
12454,III.,"And, when the nights were stormy, cold, and dark,"
12455,III.,The act of Fang was a perpetual bark;
12456,III.,"But though the master loved the growl of Fang,      200"
12457,III.,There were who vow’d the ugly cur to hang;
12458,III.,"Whose angry master, watchful for his friend,"
12459,III.,As strongly vow’d his servant to defend.
12460,III.,"In one dark night, and such as Fang before"
12461,III.,"Was ever known its tempests to outroar,"
12462,III.,To his protector’s wonder now express’d
12463,III.,No angry notes—his anger was at rest.
12464,III.,"The wond’ring master sought the silent yard,"
12465,III.,"Left Phœbe sleeping, and his door unbarr’d;"
12466,III.,Nor more returned to that forsaken bed—      210
12467,III.,"But lo! the morning came, and he was dead."
12468,III.,Fang and his master side by side were laid
12469,III.,In grim repose—their debt of nature paid!
12470,III.,The master’s hand upon the cur’s cold chest
12471,III.,"Was now reclined, and had before been press’d,"
12472,III.,As if he search’d how deep and wide the wound
12473,III.,That laid such spirit in a sleep so sound;
12474,III.,"And, when he found it was the sleep of death,"
12475,III.,A sympathising sorrow stopp’d his breath.
12476,III.,"Close to his trusty servant he was found,      220"
12477,III.,"As cold his body, and his sleep as sound."
12478,III.,We know no more; but who on horrors dwell
12479,III.,Of that same night have dreadful things to tell.
12480,III.,"Of outward force, they say, was not a sign—"
12481,III.,The hand that struck him was the Hand Divine;
12482,III.,"And then the Fiend, in that same stormy night,"
12483,III.,Was heard—as many thought—to claim his right;
12484,III.,"While grinning imps the body danced about,"
12485,III.,And then they vanish’d with triumphant shout.
12486,III.,"So think the crowd, and well it seems in them,      230"
12487,III.,That ev’n their dreams and fancies vice condemn;
12488,III.,"That not alone for virtue Reason pleads,"
12489,III.,But Nature shudders at unholy deeds;
12490,III.,"While our strong fancy lists in her defence,"
12491,III.,And takes the side of Truth and Innocence.
12492,III.,
12493,III.,
12494,IV.,IV.
12495,IV.,
12496,IV.,"_P._ But, what the fortune of the MAN, whose fear"
12497,IV.,Inform’d his Conscience that the foe was near;
12498,IV.,But yet whose interest to his desk confined
12499,IV.,That sober CLERK of indecisive mind?
12500,IV.,"_F._ JOHN served his master, with himself at strife,      240"
12501,IV.,For he with Conscience lived like man and wife;
12502,IV.,"Now jarring, now at peace,—the life they led"
12503,IV.,"Was all contention, both at board and bed:"
12504,IV.,"His meals were troubled by his scruples all,"
12505,IV.,And in his dreams he was about to fall
12506,IV.,Into some strong temptation—for it seems
12507,IV.,He never could resist it in his dreams.
12508,IV.,"At length his MASTER, dealer, smuggler, cheat,"
12509,IV.,"As John would call him in his temper’s heat,"
12510,IV.,"Proposed a something—what, is dubious still—      230"
12511,IV.,That John resisted with a stout good-will.
12512,IV.,"Scruples like his were treated with disdain,"
12513,IV.,Whose waking conscience spurn’d the offer’d gain.
12514,IV.,"“Quit then my office, scoundrel, and begone!”"
12515,IV.,"“I dare not do it,” said the affrighten’d John."
12516,IV.,"“What fear’st thou, driveller! can thy fancy tell?”"
12517,IV.,"“I doubt,” said John—“I’m sure, there is a hell.”"
12518,IV.,"“No question, wretch! thy foot is on the door;"
12519,IV.,"To be in hell, thou fool! is to be poor."
12520,IV.,"Wilt thou consent?”—But John, with many a sigh,      260"
12521,IV.,"Refused, then sank beneath his stronger eye,"
12522,IV.,Who with a curse dismiss’d the fool that dared
12523,IV.,Not join a venture which he might have shared.
12524,IV.,"The worthy Clerk then served a man in trade,"
12525,IV.,And was his friend and his companion made—
12526,IV.,"A sickly man, who sundry wares retail’d,"
12527,IV.,"Till, while his trade increased, his spirit fail’d."
12528,IV.,"John was to him a treasure, whom he proved,"
12529,IV.,"And, finding faithful, as a brother loved."
12530,IV.,"To John his views and business he consign’d,      270"
12531,IV.,And forward look’d with a contented mind;
12532,IV.,"As sickness bore him onward to the grave,"
12533,IV.,A charge of all things to his friend he gave.
12534,IV.,But neighbours talk’d—’twas idle—of the day
12535,IV.,When Richard Shale should walk the dark highway—
12536,IV.,And whisper’d—tatlers!—that the wife received
12537,IV.,"Such hints with anger, but she nothing grieved."
12538,IV.,"These whispers reach’d the man, who weak, and ill"
12539,IV.,"In mind and body, had to make his will;"
12540,IV.,"And, though he died in peace, and all resign’d,      280"
12541,IV.,’Twas plain he harbour’d fancies in his mind.
12542,IV.,"With jealous foresight, all that he had gain’d"
12543,IV.,"His widow’s was, while widow she remain’d;"
12544,IV.,"But, if another should the dame persuade"
12545,IV.,"To wed again, farewell the gains of trade:"
12546,IV.,"For if the widow’d dove could not refrain,"
12547,IV.,She must return to poverty again.
12548,IV.,"The man was buried, and the will was read,"
12549,IV.,"And censure spared them not, alive or dead!"
12550,IV.,"At first the Widow and the Clerk, her friend,      290"
12551,IV.,Spent their free days as prudence bade them spend.
12552,IV.,"At the same table they would dine, ’tis true,"
12553,IV.,And they would worship in the self-same pew:
12554,IV.,"Each had the common interest so at heart,"
12555,IV.,It would have griev’d them terribly to part;
12556,IV.,"And as they both were serious and sedate,"
12557,IV.,’Twas long before the world began to prate.
12558,IV.,"But when it prated—though without a cause,—"
12559,IV.,"It put the pair in mind of breaking laws,"
12560,IV.,Led them to reason what it was that gave      300
12561,IV.,"A husband power, when quiet in his grave."
12562,IV.,The marriage contract they had now by heart—
12563,IV.,"“Till death!”—you see, no longer—“do us part.”"
12564,IV.,"“Well! death has loosed us from the tie, but still"
12565,IV.,The loosen’d husband makes a binding will;
12566,IV.,Unjust and cruel are the acts of men.”
12567,IV.,"“Thus they—and then they sigh’d—and then—and then,"
12568,IV.,"’Twas snaring souls,” they said; and how he dared"
12569,IV.,They did not know—they wonder’d—and were snared.
12570,IV.,"“It is a marriage, surely! Conscience might      310"
12571,IV.,Allow an act so very nearly right;
12572,IV.,"Was it not witness to our solemn vow,"
12573,IV.,As man and wife? it must the act allow.”
12574,IV.,"But Conscience, stubborn to the last, replied,"
12575,IV.,“It cannot be! I am not satisfied;
12576,IV.,"’Tis not a marriage: either dare be poor,"
12577,IV.,"Or dare be virtuous—part, and sin no more!”"
12578,IV.,Alas! they many a fond evasion made;
12579,IV.,They could relinquish neither love nor trade.
12580,IV.,"They went to church, but, thinking, fail’d to pray;      320"
12581,IV.,They felt not ease or comfort at a play.
12582,IV.,If times were good—“We merit not such times;”
12583,IV.,If ill—“Is this the produce of our crimes?”
12584,IV.,When sick—“’Tis thus forbidden pleasures cease;”
12585,IV.,"When well—they both demand, “Had Zimri peace?"
12586,IV.,"For though our worthy master was not slain,"
12587,IV.,His injured ghost has reason to complain.”
12588,IV.,"Ah, John! bethink thee of thy generous joy,"
12589,IV.,When Conscience drove thee from thy late employ;
12590,IV.,"When thou wert poor, and knew not where to run,      330"
12591,IV.,"But then could say, “The will of God be done!”"
12592,IV.,"When thou that will, and not thine own, obey’d—"
12593,IV.,"Of Him alone, and not of man afraid."
12594,IV.,"Thou then hadst pity on that wretch, and, free"
12595,IV.,"Thyself, couldst pray for him who injured thee;"
12596,IV.,"Then how alert thy step, thyself how light"
12597,IV.,All the day long! thy sleep how sound at night!
12598,IV.,"But now, though plenty on thy board be found,"
12599,IV.,"And thou hast credit with thy neighbours round,"
12600,IV.,"Yet there is something in thy looks that tells,      340"
12601,IV.,An odious secret in thy bosom dwells.
12602,IV.,"Thy form is not erect, thy neighbours trace"
12603,IV.,A coward spirit in thy shifting pace.
12604,IV.,"Thou goest to meeting, not from any call,"
12605,IV.,"But just to hear, that we are sinners all—"
12606,IV.,"And equal sinners, or the difference made"
12607,IV.,’Twixt man and man has but the slightest shade;
12608,IV.,"That reformation asks a world of pains,"
12609,IV.,"And, after all, must leave a thousand stains;"
12610,IV.,"And, worst of all, we must the work begin      350"
12611,IV.,By first attacking the prevailing sin!—
12612,IV.,"These thoughts the feeble mind of John assail,"
12613,IV.,And o’er his reason and his fears prevail;
12614,IV.,"They fill his mind with hopes of gifts and grace,      }"
12615,IV.,"Faith, feelings!—something that supplies the place      }"
12616,IV.,Of true conversion—this will he embrace;      }
12617,IV.,For John perceives that he was scarcely tried
12618,IV.,"By the first conquest, that increased his pride,"
12619,IV.,"When he refused his master’s crime to aid,"
12620,IV.,And by his self-applause was amply paid.      360
12621,IV.,But now he feels the difference—feels it hard
12622,IV.,Against his will and favourite wish to guard;
12623,IV.,"He mourns his weakness, hopes he shall prevail"
12624,IV.,"Against his frailty, and yet still is frail."
12625,IV.,Such is his life! and such the life must be
12626,IV.,"Of all who will be bound, yet would be free;"
12627,IV.,Who would unite what God to part decrees—
12628,IV.,"The offended conscience, and the mind at ease:"
12629,IV.,"Who think, but vainly think, to sin and pray,"
12630,IV.,And God and Mammon in their turn obey.      370
12631,IV.,Such is his life!—and so I would not live
12632,IV.,For all that wealthy widows have to give.

12641,I.,
12642,I.,"The purest Friendship, like the finest ware,"
12643,I.,"Deserves our praises, but demands our care."
12644,I.,"For admiration we the things produce,"
12645,I.,But they are not design’d for common use;
12646,I.,"Flaws the most trifling from their virtue take,"
12647,I.,And lamentation for their loss we make;
12648,I.,"While common Friendships, like the wares of clay,"
12649,I.,"Are a cheap kind, but useful every day."
12650,I.,"Though crack’d and damaged, still we make them do;"
12651,I.,"And, when they’re broken, they’re forgotten too.      10"
12652,I.,There is within the world in which we dwell
12653,I.,"A Friendship, answering to that world full well:"
12654,I.,"An interchange of looks and actions kind,"
12655,I.,"And, in some sense, an intercourse of mind;"
12656,I.,"A useful commerce, a convenient trade,"
12657,I.,By which both parties are the happier made;
12658,I.,"And, when the thing is rightly understood,"
12659,I.,"And justly valued, it is wise and good."
12660,I.,I speak not here of Friendships that excite
12661,I.,In boys at school such wonder and delight—      20
12662,I.,"Of high, heroic Friends, in serious strife"
12663,I.,Contending which should yield a forfeit life—
12664,I.,"Such wondrous love, in their maturer days,"
12665,I.,"Men, if they credit, are content to praise."
12666,I.,"I speak not here of Friendships true and just,"
12667,I.,When friend can friend with life and honour trust;
12668,I.,"Where mind to mind has long familiar grown,"
12669,I.,"And every failing, every virtue known."
12670,I.,"Of these I speak not—things so rich and rare,"
12671,I.,"That we degrade with jewels to compare,      30"
12672,I.,Or bullion pure and massy.—I intend
12673,I.,"To treat of one whose Neighbour called him Friend,"
12674,I.,Or called him Neighbour; and with reason good—
12675,I.,The friendship rising from the neighbourhood:
12676,I.,"A sober kind, in common service known,"
12677,I.,Not such as is in death and peril shown;
12678,I.,"Such as will give or ask a helping hand,"
12679,I.,But no important sacrifice demand;
12680,I.,"In fact, a friendship that will long abide,"
12681,I.,"If seldom rashly, never strongly, tried.      40"
12682,I.,"Yes! these are sober friendships, made for use,"
12683,I.,And much convenience they in life produce:
12684,I.,"Like a good coat, that keeps us from the cold,"
12685,I.,The cloth of frieze is not a cloth of gold;
12686,I.,"But neither is it pyebald, pieced, and poor;"
12687,I.,"’Tis a good useful coat, and nothing more."
12688,I.,"Such is the Friendship of the world approved,"
12689,I.,And here the Friends so loving and so loved.—
12690,I.,"DANVERS and RAYNER, equals, who had made"
12691,I.,"Each decent fortune, both were yet in trade;      50"
12692,I.,"While sons and daughters, with a youthful zeal,"
12693,I.,Seem’d the hereditary love to feel;
12694,I.,"And ev’n their wives, though either might pretend"
12695,I.,"To claim some notice, call’d each other friend."
12696,I.,"While yet their offspring boys and girls appear’d,"
12697,I.,"The fathers ask’d, “What evil could be fear’d?”"
12698,I.,"Nor is it easy to assign the year,"
12699,I.,When cautious parents should begin to fear.
12700,I.,"The boys must leave their schools, and, by and by,"
12701,I.,The girls are sure to grow reserved and shy;      60
12702,I.,"And then, suppose a real love should rise,"
12703,I.,It but unites the equal families.
12704,I.,Love does not always from such freedom spring;
12705,I.,"Distrust, perhaps, would sooner cause the thing."
12706,I.,"“We will not check it, neither will we force”—"
12707,I.,Thus said the fathers—“Let it take its course.”
12708,I.,It took its course:—young Richard Danvers’ mind
12709,I.,In Phœbe Rayner found what lovers find—
12710,I.,"Sense, beauty, sweetness; all that mortal eyes"
12711,I.,"Can see, or heart conceive, or thought devise.      70"
12712,I.,"And Phœbe’s eye, and thought, and heart could trace"
12713,I.,In Richard Danvers every manly grace—
12714,I.,"All that e’er maiden wish’d, or matron prized—"
12715,I.,So well these good young people sympathised.
12716,I.,"All their relations, neighbours, and allies,"
12717,I.,"All their dependants, visitors, and spies,"
12718,I.,"Such as a wealthy family caress,"
12719,I.,"Said here was love, and drank to love’s success."
12720,I.,"’Tis thus I leave the parties, young and old,"
12721,I.,Lovers and Friends. Will Love and Friendship hold?      80
12722,I.,"Will Prudence with the children’s wish comply,"
12723,I.,And Friendship strengthen with that new ally?
12724,I.,

12726,II.,II.
12727,II.,
12728,II.,_P._ I see no more within our borough’s bound
12729,II.,The name of DANVERS! Is it to be found?
12730,II.,"Were the young pair in Hymen’s fetters tied,"
12731,II.,Or did succeeding years the Friends divide?
12732,II.,"_F._ Nay! take the story, as by time brought forth,"
12733,II.,And of such Love and Friendship judge the worth.
12734,II.,While the lad’s love—his parents call’d it so—
12735,II.,"Was going on, as well as love could go,      90"
12736,II.,"A wealthy Danvers, in a distant place,"
12737,II.,Left a large fortune to this favour’d race.
12738,II.,"To that same place the father quickly went,"
12739,II.,And Richard only murmur’d weak dissent.
12740,II.,Of Richard’s heart the parent truly guess’d:—
12741,II.,"“Well, my good lad! then do what suits thee best;"
12742,II.,No doubt thy brothers will do all they can
12743,II.,T’ obey the orders of the good old man.
12744,II.,"Well, I would not thy free-born spirit bind;"
12745,II.,"Take, Dick, the way to which thou’rt most inclined.”      100"
12746,II.,No answer gave the youth; nor did he swear
12747,II.,The old man’s riches were beneath his care;
12748,II.,"Nor that he would with his dear Phœbe stay,"
12749,II.,And let his heartless father move away.
12750,II.,"No! kind and constant, tender, faithful, fond—"
12751,II.,Thus far he’d go—but not one step beyond!
12752,II.,Not disobedient to a parent’s will—
12753,II.,A lover constant—but dependent still.
12754,II.,"Letters, at first, between the constant swain"
12755,II.,And the kind damsel banish’d all their pain.      110
12756,II.,Both full and quick they were; for lovers write
12757,II.,"With vast despatch, and read with vast delight—"
12758,II.,So quick they were—for Love is never slow—
12759,II.,"So full, they ever seem’d to overflow."
12760,II.,"Their hearts are ever fill’d with grief or joy,"
12761,II.,And these to paint is every hour’s employ;
12762,II.,"Joy they would not retain, and, for their grief,"
12763,II.,To read such letters is a sure relief.
12764,II.,"But, in due time, both joy and grief supprest,"
12765,II.,They found their comfort in a little rest.      120
12766,II.,"Mails went and came without the accustom’d freight,"
12767,II.,"For Love grew patient, and content to wait—"
12768,II.,"Yet was not dead, nor yet afraid to die;"
12769,II.,"For, though he wrote not, Richard wonder’d why."
12770,II.,"He could not justly tell how letters pass’d,"
12771,II.,"But, as to him appear’d, he wrote the last;"
12772,II.,In this he meant not to accuse the maid—
12773,II.,"Love, in some cases, ceases to upbraid."
12774,II.,"Yet not indifferent was our Lover grown,"
12775,II.,Although the ardour of the flame was flown;      130
12776,II.,"He still of Phœbe thought, her lip, her smile—"
12777,II.,But grew contented with his fate the while.
12778,II.,"Thus, not inconstant were the youthful pair—"
12779,II.,The Lad remembered still the Lass was fair;
12780,II.,"And Phœbe still, with half-affected sigh,"
12781,II.,Thought it a pity that such love should die;
12782,II.,"And had they then, with this persuasion, met,"
12783,II.,"Love had rekindled, and been glowing yet."
12784,II.,But times were changed; no mention now was made
12785,II.,"By the old Squire, or by the young, of trade.      140"
12786,II.,"The worthy Lady, and her children all,"
12787,II.,Had due respect—The People at the Hall.
12788,II.,"His Worship now read Burn, and talk’d with skill"
12789,II.,"About the poor-house, and the turnpike-bill;"
12790,II.,"Lord of a manor, he had serious claims,"
12791,II.,And knew the poaching rascals by their names.
12792,II.,"And, if the father thus improved his mind,"
12793,II.,Be sure the children were not far behind:
12794,II.,"To rank and riches what respect was due,"
12795,II.,"To them and theirs what deference, well they knew,      150"
12796,II.,"And, from the greatest to the least, could show"
12797,II.,What to the favouring few the favour’d many owe.
12798,II.,"The mind of man must have whereon to work,"
12799,II.,Or it will rust—we see it in the Turk;
12800,II.,"And Justice Danvers, though he read the news,"
12801,II.,And all of law that magistrates peruse—
12802,II.,Bills about roads and charities—yet still
12803,II.,Wanted employ his vacant mind to fill;
12804,II.,"These were not like the shipping, once his pride,"
12805,II.,"Now, with his blue surtout, laid all aside.      160"
12806,II.,"No doubt, his spirits in their ebb to raise,"
12807,II.,He found some help in men’s respect and praise—
12808,II.,"Praise of his house, his land, his lawn, his trees—"
12809,II.,He cared not what—to praise him was to please:
12810,II.,"Yet, though his rural neighbours called to dine,"
12811,II.,"And some might kindly praise his food and wine,"
12812,II.,"This was not certain, and, another day,"
12813,II.,He must the visit and the praise repay.
12814,II.,By better motives urged—we will suppose—
12815,II.,He thus began his purpose to disclose      170
12816,II.,"To his good lady:—“We have lived a year,"
12817,II.,And never ask’d our friends the Rayners here.
12818,II.,"Do let us ask them—as for Richard’s flame,"
12819,II.,"It went, we see, as idly as it came—"
12820,II.,"Invite them kindly—here’s a power of room,"
12821,II.,And the poor people will be glad to come.
12822,II.,"Outside and in, the coach will hold them all,"
12823,II.,And set them down beside the garden wall.”
12824,II.,"The Lady wrote, for that was all he meant,"
12825,II.,Kind soul! by asking for his wife’s assent;      180
12826,II.,And every Rayner was besought to come
12827,II.,To dine in Hulver Hall’s grand dining-room.
12828,II.,"About this time old Rayner, who had lost"
12829,II.,"His Friend’s advice, was by misfortune cross’d:"
12830,II.,"Some debtors fail’d, when large amounts were due,"
12831,II.,"So large, that he was nearly failing too;"
12832,II.,"But he, grown wary, that he might not fail,"
12833,II.,"Brought to in adverse gales, and shorten’d sail;"
12834,II.,"This done, he rested, and could now attend"
12835,II.,The invitation of his distant Friend.      190
12836,II.,"“Well! he would go; but not, indeed, t’ admire"
12837,II.,The state and grandeur of the new-made Squire;
12838,II.,"Danvers, belike, now wealthy, might impart"
12839,II.,"Some of his gold; for Danvers had a heart,"
12840,II.,"And may have heard, though guarded so around,"
12841,II.,That I have lost the fortune he has found.
12842,II.,"Yes! Dick is kind, or he and his fine seat"
12843,II.,Might go to——where we never more should meet.”
12844,II.,"Now, lo! the Rayners all at Hulver Place—"
12845,II.,Or Hulver Hall—’tis not a certain case;      200
12846,II.,’Tis only known that Ladies’ notes were sent
12847,II.,"Directed both ways, and they always went."
12848,II.,"We pass the greetings, and the dinner pass,"
12849,II.,"All the male gossip o’er the sparkling glass,"
12850,II.,"And female, when retired.—The Squire invites"
12851,II.,"His Friend, by sleep refresh’d, to see his sights—"
12852,II.,"His land and lions, granary, barns, and crops,      }"
12853,II.,"His dairy, piggery, pinery, apples, hops;—      }"
12854,II.,"But here a hill appears, and Peter Rayner stops.      }"
12855,II.,"“Ah! my old Friend, I give you joy,” he cries;      210"
12856,II.,"“But some are born to fall, and some to rise;"
12857,II.,"You’re better many a thousand, I the worse—"
12858,II.,"Dick, there’s no dealing with a failing purse;"
12859,II.,Nor does it shame me (mine is all mischance)
12860,II.,To wish some friendly neighbour would advance”—
12861,II.,——But here the guest on such a theme was low.
12862,II.,"His host, meantime, intent upon the show,"
12863,II.,In hearing heard not—they came out to see—
12864,II.,"And, pushing forward, “There’s a view,” quoth he;"
12865,II.,"“Observe that ruin, built, you see, to catch      220"
12866,II.,The gazer’s eye; that cottage with the thatch—
12867,II.,It cost me—guess you what?”—that sound of _cost_
12868,II.,"Was accidental, but it was not lost."
12869,II.,"“Ah! my good Friend, be sure such things as these"
12870,II.,Suit well enough a man who lives at ease.
12871,II.,"Think what ‘The Betsy’ _cost_, and think the shock"
12872,II.,Of losing her upon the Dodder-Rock!
12873,II.,The tidings reach’d me on the very day
12874,II.,"That villain robb’d us, and then ran away."
12875,II.,Loss upon loss! now if”——
12876,II.,“Do stay a bit;”      230
12877,II.,"Exclaim’d the Squire, “these matters hardly fit"
12878,II.,A morning ramble—let me show you now
12879,II.,"My team of oxen, and my patent plough."
12880,II.,Talk of your horses! I the plan condemn—
12881,II.,They eat us up—but oxen! we eat them;
12882,II.,"For first they plough and bring us bread to eat,"
12883,II.,And then we fat and kill them—there’s the meat.
12884,II.,What’s your opinion?”—
12885,II.,"—“I am poorly fed,"
12886,II.,"And much afraid to want both meat and bread,”"
12887,II.,"Said Rayner, half indignant; and the Squire      240}"
12888,II.,"Sigh’d, as he felt he must no more require      }"
12889,II.,"A man, whose prospects fail’d, his prospects to admire.      }"
12890,II.,"Homeward they moved, and met a gentle pair,"
12891,II.,"The poor man’s daughter, and the rich man’s heir."
12892,II.,"This caused some thought; but on the couple went,"
12893,II.,And a soft hour in tender converse spent.
12894,II.,"This pair, in fact, their passion roused anew,"
12895,II.,Alone much comfort from the visit drew.
12896,II.,"At home the Ladies were engaged, and all"
12897,II.,Show’d or were shown the wonders of the Hall;      250
12898,II.,"From room to room the weary guests went on,"
12899,II.,Till every Rayner wish’d the show was done.
12900,II.,Home they return’d; the Father deeply sigh’d      }
12901,II.,To find he vainly had for aid applied;      }
12902,II.,It hurt him much to ask—and more to be denied.      }
12903,II.,"The younger Richard, who alone sustain’d"
12904,II.,"The dying Friendship, true to Love remain’d."
12905,II.,"His Phœbe’s smiles, although he did not yet"
12906,II.,"Fly to behold, he could not long forget;"
12907,II.,"Nor durst he visit, nor was love so strong,      260"
12908,II.,That he could more than think his Father wrong;
12909,II.,"For, wrong or right, that father still profess’d"
12910,II.,The most obedient son should fare the best.
12911,II.,"So time pass’d on; the second spring appear’d,"
12912,II.,Ere Richard ventured on the deed he fear’d.—
12913,II.,"He dared at length; and not so much for love,"
12914,II.,"I grieve to add, but that he meant to prove"
12915,II.,"He had a will.—His father, in reply,"
12916,II.,"This known, had answer’d, “So, my son, have I.”"
12917,II.,"But Richard’s courage was by prudence taught,      270"
12918,II.,And he his nymph in secret service sought.
12919,II.,"Some days of absence—not with full consent,      }"
12920,II.,But with slow leave—were to entreaty lent;      }
12921,II.,"And forth the Lover rode, uncertain what he meant.      }"
12922,II.,"He reached the dwelling he had known so long,"
12923,II.,"When a pert damsel told him, “he was wrong;"
12924,II.,"Their house she did not just precisely know,"
12925,II.,But he would find it somewhere in _the Row_;
12926,II.,"The Rayners now were come a little down,"
12927,II.,Nor more the topmost people in the town.”      280
12928,II.,"She might have added, they their life enjoy’d,"
12929,II.,Although on things less hazardous employ’d.
12930,II.,"This was not much; but yet the damsel’s sneer,"
12931,II.,"And the Row-dwelling of a lass so dear,"
12932,II.,"Were somewhat startling. He had heard, indeed,"
12933,II.,That Rayner’s business did not well succeed:
12934,II.,"“But what of that? They lived in decent style,"
12935,II.,"No doubt, and Phœbe still retain’d her smile;"
12936,II.,"And why,” he asked, “should all men choose to dwell"
12937,II.,"In broad cold streets?—the Row does just as well,      290"
12938,II.,Quiet and snug;” and then the favourite maid
12939,II.,"Rose in his fancy, tastefully array’d,"
12940,II.,"Looking with grateful joy upon the swain,"
12941,II.,Who could his love in trying times retain.
12942,II.,"Soothed by such thoughts, to the new house he came,"
12943,II.,"Surveyed its aspect, sigh’d, and gave his name."
12944,II.,"But ere they opened, he had waited long,"
12945,II.,And heard a movement—Was there somewhat wrong?
12946,II.,"Nay, but a friendly party, he was told;      }"
12947,II.,"And look’d around, as wishing to behold      300}"
12948,II.,Some friends—but these were not the friends of old.      }
12949,II.,"Old Peter Rayner, in his own old mode,"
12950,II.,"Bade the Squire welcome to his new abode,"
12951,II.,"For Richard had been kind, and doubtless meant"
12952,II.,"To make proposals now, and ask consent."
12953,II.,"Mamma and misses, too, were civil all;"
12954,II.,"But what their awkward courtesy to call,"
12955,II.,He knew not; neither could he well express
12956,II.,His sad sensations at their strange address.
12957,II.,"And then their laughter loud, their story-telling,      310"
12958,II.,All seem’d befitting to that Row and dwelling;
12959,II.,The hearty welcome to the various treat
12960,II.,Was lost on him—he could nor laugh nor eat.
12961,II.,"But one thing pleased him, when he look’d around,"
12962,II.,His clearest Phœbe could not there be found:
12963,II.,"“Wise and discreet,” he says, “she shuns the crew"
12964,II.,"Of vulgar neighbours, some kind act to do;"
12965,II.,"In some fair house, some female friend to meet,"
12966,II.,Or take at evening prayer in church her seat.”
12967,II.,"Meantime there rose, amid the ceaseless din,      320}"
12968,II.,"A mingled scent, that crowded room within,      }"
12969,II.,"Rum and red-herring, Cheshire cheese and gin;      }"
12970,II.,"Pipes, too, and punch, and sausages, with tea,"
12971,II.,Were things that Richard was disturbed to see.
12972,II.,"Impatient now, he left them in disdain,"
12973,II.,"To call on Phœbe, when he call’d again;"
12974,II.,"To walk with her, the morning fair and bright,"
12975,II.,And lose the painful feelings of the night.
12976,II.,"All in the Row, and tripping at the side"
12977,II.,"Of a young Sailor, he the nymph espied,      330"
12978,II.,"As, homeward hastening with her happy boy,"
12979,II.,"She went to join the party, and enjoy."
12980,II.,"“Fie!” Phœbe cried, as her companion spoke,"
12981,II.,Yet laugh’d to hear the fie-compelling joke;—
12982,II.,"Then ’twas her chance to meet, her shame to know,      }"
12983,II.,"Her tender Richard, moving sad and slow,      }"
12984,II.,"Musing on things full strange, the manners of the Row.      }"
12985,II.,"At first amazed, and then alarm’d, the fair"
12986,II.,Late-laughing maid now stood in dumb despair.
12987,II.,As when a debtor meets in human shape      340
12988,II.,"The foe of debtors, and cannot escape,"
12989,II.,"He stands in terror, nor can longer aim"
12990,II.,"To keep his credit, or preserve his name,"
12991,II.,Stood Phœbe fix’d! “Unlucky time and place!
12992,II.,An earlier hour had kept me from disgrace!”
12993,II.,"She thought—but now the sailor, undismay’d,"
12994,II.,"Said, “My dear Phœbe, why are you afraid?"
12995,II.,"The man seems civil, or he soon should prove"
12996,II.,That I can well defend the girl I love.
12997,II.,Are you not mine?” She utter’d no reply:—      350}
12998,II.,"“Thine I must be,” she thought; “more foolish I!”      }"
12999,II.,While Richard at the scene stood mute and wondering by.      }
13000,II.,"His spirits hurried, but his bosom light,"
13001,II.,He left his Phœbe with a calm “good night!”
13002,II.,So Love like Friendship fell! The youth awhile
13003,II.,"Dreamt, sorely moved, of Phœbe’s witching smile—"
13004,II.,But learned in daylight visions to forego
13005,II.,"The Sailor’s laughing Lass, the Phœbe of the Row."
13006,II.,"Home turn’d young Richard, in due time to turn,"
13007,II.,"With all old Richard’s zeal, the leaves of Burn;      360"
13008,II.,And home turned Phœbe—in due time to grace
13009,II.,A tottering cabin with a tattered race.

13018,I.,
13019,I.,"The man who dwells where party-spirit reigns,"
13020,I.,"May feel its triumphs, but must wear its chains;"
13021,I.,He must the friends and foes of party take
13022,I.,"For his, and suffer for his honour’s sake;"
13023,I.,"When once enlisted upon either side,"
13024,I.,He must the rude septennial storm abide—
13025,I.,"A storm that when its utmost rage is gone,"
13026,I.,In cold and angry mutterings murmurs on;
13027,I.,"A slow unbending scorn, a cold disdain—"
13028,I.,Till years bring the full tempest back again.      10
13029,I.,"Within our Borough two stiff sailors dwelt,"
13030,I.,Who both this party storm and triumph felt;
13031,I.,"Men who had talents, and were both design’d"
13032,I.,"For better things, but anger made them blind."
13033,I.,"In the same year they married, and their wives"
13034,I.,"Had pass’d in friendship their yet peaceful lives,"
13035,I.,"And, as they married in a time of peace,"
13036,I.,Had no suspicion that their love must cease.
13037,I.,"In fact it did not; but they met by stealth,"
13038,I.,And that perhaps might keep their love in health;      20
13039,I.,"Like children watch’d, desirous yet afraid,"
13040,I.,Their visits all were with discretion paid.
13041,I.,"One Captain, so by courtesy we call"
13042,I.,Our [hoys’] commanders—they are captains all—
13043,I.,Had sons and daughters many; while but one
13044,I.,The rival Captain bless’d—a darling son.
13045,I.,"Each was a burgess to his party tied,"
13046,I.,"And each was fix’d, but on a different side;"
13047,I.,And he who sought his son’s pure mind to fill
13048,I.,"With wholesome food, would evil too instil.      30"
13049,I.,The last in part succeeded—but in part—
13050,I.,"For Charles had sense, had virtue, had a heart;"
13051,I.,And he had soon the cause of Nature tried
13052,I.,"With the stern father, but this father died;"
13053,I.,Who on his death-bed thus his son address’d:—
13054,I.,"“Swear to me, Charles, and let my spirit rest—"
13055,I.,"Swear to our party to be ever true,"
13056,I.,"And let me die in peace—I pray thee, do.”"
13057,I.,"With some reluctance, but obedience more,"
13058,I.,"The weeping youth reflected, sigh’d, and swore;      40"
13059,I.,"Trembling, he swore for ever to be true,"
13060,I.,And wear no colour but the untainted Blue.
13061,I.,"This done, the Captain died in so much joy,"
13062,I.,As if he’d wrought salvation for his boy.
13063,I.,"The female friends their wishes yet retain’d,"
13064,I.,"But seldom met, by female fears restrain’d;"
13065,I.,"Yet in such town, where girls and boys must meet,"
13066,I.,"And every house is known in every street,"
13067,I.,"Charles had before, nay since his father’s death,"
13068,I.,"Met, say by chance, the young Elizabeth;      50"
13069,I.,"Who was both good and graceful, and in truth"
13070,I.,Was but too pleasing to th’ observing youth;
13071,I.,"And why I know not, but the youth to her"
13072,I.,Seem’d just that being that she could prefer.
13073,I.,Both were disposed to think that party-strife
13074,I.,Destroy’d the happiest intercourse of life;
13075,I.,"Charles, too, his growing passion could defend—"
13076,I.,His father’s foe he call’d his mother’s friend.
13077,I.,"Mothers, indeed, he knew were ever kind;"
13078,I.,But in the Captain should he favour find?      60
13079,I.,He doubted this—yet could he that command
13080,I.,"Which fathers love, and few its power withstand."
13081,I.,The mothers both agreed their joint request
13082,I.,Should to the Captain jointly be address’d;
13083,I.,"And first the lover should his heart assail,      }"
13084,I.,"And then the ladies, and, if all should fail,      }"
13085,I.,"They’d singly watch the hour, and jointly might prevail.      }"
13086,I.,"The Captain’s heart, although unused to melt,"
13087,I.,A strong impression from persuasion felt;
13088,I.,"His pride was soften’d by the prayers he heard,      70"
13089,I.,And then advantage in the match appear’d.
13090,I.,At length he answer’d—“Let the lad enlist
13091,I.,"In our good cause, and I no more resist;"
13092,I.,"For I have sworn, and to my oath am true,"
13093,I.,"To hate that colour, that rebellious Blue."
13094,I.,"His father once, ere master of the brig,"
13095,I.,For that advantage turn’d a rascal Whig;
13096,I.,Now let the son—a wife’s a better thing—
13097,I.,"A Tory turn, and say, God save the King!"
13098,I.,"For I am pledged to serve that sacred cause,      80"
13099,I.,"And love my country, while I keep her laws.”"
13100,I.,"The women trembled, for they knew full well"
13101,I.,The fact they dare not to the Captain tell;
13102,I.,"And the poor youth declared, with tears and sighs,"
13103,I.,“My oath was pass’d; I dare not compromise.”
13104,I.,"But Charles to reason made his strong appeal,"
13105,I.,And to the heart—he bade him think and feel:
13106,I.,"The Captain answering, with reply as strong—"
13107,I.,"“If you be right, then how can I be wrong?"
13108,I.,You to your father swore to take his part;      90
13109,I.,"I to oppose it ever, head and heart;"
13110,I.,"You to a parent made your oath, and I"
13111,I.,To God! and can I to my Maker lie?
13112,I.,"Much, my dear lad, I for your sake would do,"
13113,I.,"But I have sworn, and to my oath am true.”"
13114,I.,"Thus stood the parties, when my fortunes bore"
13115,I.,Me far away from this my native shore;
13116,I.,"And who prevail’d, I know not—Young or Old;"
13117,I.,"But, I beseech you, let the tale be told."
13118,I.,

13120,II.,II.
13121,II.,
13122,II.,_P._ How fared these lovers? Many a time I thought      100
13123,II.,How with their ill-starr’d passion Time had wrought.
13124,II.,"Did either party from his oath recede,"
13125,II.,Or were they never from the bondage freed?
13126,II.,_F._ Alas! replied my Friend—the tale I tell
13127,II.,"With some reluctance, nor can do it well."
13128,II.,"There are three females in the place, and they,"
13129,II.,"Like skilful painters, could the facts portray"
13130,II.,In their strong colours—all that I can do      }
13131,II.,Is to present a weak imperfect view;      }
13132,II.,The colours I must leave—the outlines shall be true.      110}
13133,II.,"Soon did each party see the other’s mind,"
13134,II.,"What bound them both, and what was like to bind;"
13135,II.,"Oaths deeply taken in such time and place,"
13136,II.,To break them now was dreadful—was disgrace!
13137,II.,"“That oath a dying father bade me take,"
13138,II.,Can I—yourself a father—can I break?
13139,II.,"“That oath which I, a living sinner, took"
13140,II.,"Shall I make void, and yet for mercy look?”"
13141,II.,"The women wept; the men, themselves distress’d,"
13142,II.,The cruel rage of party zeal confess’d;      120
13143,II.,"But solemn oaths, though sprung from party zeal,"
13144,II.,"Feel them we must, as Christians ought to feel."
13145,II.,"Yet shall a youth so good, a girl so fair,"
13146,II.,From their obedience only draw despair?
13147,II.,Must they be parted? Is there not a way
13148,II.,For them both love and duty to obey?
13149,II.,Strongly they hoped; and by their friends around
13150,II.,"A way, at least a lover’s way, was found."
13151,II.,“Give up your vote; you’ll then no longer be
13152,II.,"Free in one sense, but in the better free.”      130"
13153,II.,"Such was of reasoning friends the kind advice,"
13154,II.,And how could lovers in such case be nice?
13155,II.,"A man may swear to walk directly on,"
13156,II.,"While sight remains; but how, if sight be gone?"
13157,II.,"“Oaths are not binding when the party’s dead,"
13158,II.,Or when the power to keep the oath is fled;
13159,II.,"If I’ve no vote, I’ve neither friend nor foe,"
13160,II.,Nor can be said on either side to go.”
13161,II.,"They were no casuists:—“Well!” the Captain cried,"
13162,II.,"“Give up your vote, man, and behold your bride!”      140"
13163,II.,"Thus was it fix’d, and fix’d the day for both"
13164,II.,"To take the vow, and set aside the oath."
13165,II.,"It gave some pain; but all agreed to say,"
13166,II.,"“You’re now absolved, and have no other way."
13167,II.,’Tis not expected you should love resign
13168,II.,"At man’s commands, for love’s are all divine.”"
13169,II.,"When all is quiet and the mind at rest,"
13170,II.,All in the calm of innocence are blest;
13171,II.,"But when some scruple mixes with our joy,"
13172,II.,We love to give the anxious mind employ.      150
13173,II.,"In autumn late, when evening suns were bright,"
13174,II.,The day was fix’d the lovers to unite;
13175,II.,But one before the eager Captain chose
13176,II.,"To break, with jocund act, his girl’s repose,"
13177,II.,"And, sailor-like, said, “Hear how I intend"
13178,II.,"One day, before the day of days, to spend!"
13179,II.,"All round the quay, and by the river’s side,"
13180,II.,Shall be a scene of glory for the bride.
13181,II.,"We’ll have a RACE, and colours will devise"
13182,II.,"For every boat, for every man, a prize;      160"
13183,II.,But that which first returns shall bear away
13184,II.,The proudest pendant—Let us name the day!”
13185,II.,They named the day; and never morn more bright
13186,II.,"Rose on the river, nor so proud a sight;"
13187,II.,"Or, if too calm appear’d the cloudless skies,"
13188,II.,Experienced seamen said the wind would rise.
13189,II.,To that full quay from this then vacant place
13190,II.,Thronged a vast crowd to see the promised Race.
13191,II.,"Mid boats new painted, all with streamers fair,"
13192,II.,That flagg’d or flutter’d in that quiet air—      170
13193,II.,"The Captain’s boat that was so gay and trim,"
13194,II.,"That made his pride, and seem’d as proud of him—"
13195,II.,"Her, in her beauty, we might all discern,"
13196,II.,"Her rigging new, and painted on the stern,"
13197,II.,"As one who could not in the contest fail,"
13198,II.,“Learn of _the little Nautilus_ to sail.”
13199,II.,"So forth they started at the signal gun,"
13200,II.,And down the river had three leagues to run;
13201,II.,"This sail’d, they then their watery way retrace,"
13202,II.,And the first landed conquers in the race.      180
13203,II.,"The crowd await, till they no more discern;"
13204,II.,"Then, parting, say, “At evening we return.”"
13205,II.,"I could proceed; but you will guess the fate,"
13206,II.,And but too well my tale anticipate.
13207,II.,_P._ True! yet proceed—
13208,II.,_F._ The lovers had some grief
13209,II.,"In this day’s parting, but the time was brief;"
13210,II.,"And the poor girl, between his smiles and sighs,"
13211,II.,"Ask’d, “Do you wish to gain so poor a prize?”"
13212,II.,"“But that your father wishes,” he replied,"
13213,II.,“I would the honour had been still denied:      190
13214,II.,"It makes me gloomy, though I would be gay,"
13215,II.,And oh! it seems an everlasting day.”
13216,II.,"So thought the lass, and as she said, “Farewell!”"
13217,II.,"Soft sighs arose, and tears unbidden fell."
13218,II.,"The morn was calm, and ev’n till noon the strong"
13219,II.,Unruffled flood moved quietly along;
13220,II.,"In the dead calm the billows softly fell,"
13221,II.,And mock’d the whistling sea-boy’s favourite spell:
13222,II.,"So rests at noon the reaper, but to rise"
13223,II.,With mightier force and twofold energies.      200
13224,II.,"The deep, broad stream moved softly, all was hush’d,"
13225,II.,When o’er the flood the breeze awakening brush’d;
13226,II.,"A sullen sound was heard along the deep,"
13227,II.,The stormy spirit rousing from his sleep;
13228,II.,"The porpoise rolling on the troubled wave,"
13229,II.,Unwieldy tokens of his pleasure gave;
13230,II.,"Dark, chilling clouds the troubled deep deform,"
13231,II.,"And, led by terror downward, rush’d the storm."
13232,II.,"As evening came, along the river’s side,"
13233,II.,"Or on the quay, impatient crowds divide,      210"
13234,II.,"And then collect; some whispering, as afraid"
13235,II.,"Of what they saw, and more of what they said,"
13236,II.,And yet must speak: how sudden and how great
13237,II.,"The danger seem’d, and what might be the fate"
13238,II.,"Of men so toss’d about in craft so small,"
13239,II.,"Lost in the dark, and subject to the squall."
13240,II.,"Then sounds are so appalling in the night,"
13241,II.,"And, could we see, how terrible the sight;"
13242,II.,"None knew the evils that they all suspect,"
13243,II.,And Hope at once they covet and reject.      220
13244,II.,"But where the wife, her friend, her daughter, where?"
13245,II.,"Alas! in grief, in terror, in despair—"
13246,II.,"At home, abroad, upon the quay. No rest"
13247,II.,"In any place, but where they are not, best."
13248,II.,"Fearful they ask, but dread the sad reply,"
13249,II.,And many a sailor tells the friendly lie—
13250,II.,"“There is no danger—that is, we believe,"
13251,II.,"And think—and hope”—but this does not deceive,"
13252,II.,"Although it soothes them; while they look around,"
13253,II.,Trembling at every sight and every sound.      230
13254,II.,"Let me not dwell on terrors——It is dark,"
13255,II.,"And lights are carried to and fro, and hark!"
13256,II.,"There is a cry—“a boat, a boat at hand!”      }"
13257,II.,What a still terror is there now on land!      }
13258,II.,"“Whose, whose?” they all enquire, and none can understand.      }"
13259,II.,At length they come—and oh! how then rejoice
13260,II.,A wife and children at that welcome voice!
13261,II.,It is not theirs—but what have these to tell?
13262,II.,“Where did you leave the Captain—were they well?”
13263,II.,"Alas! they know not, they had felt an awe      240"
13264,II.,"In dread of death, and knew not what they saw."
13265,II.,"Thus they depart—The evening darker grows,"
13266,II.,"The lights shake wildly, and as wildly blows"
13267,II.,"The stormy night-wind; fear possesses all,"
13268,II.,"The hardest hearts, in this sad interval."
13269,II.,But hark again to voices loud and high!
13270,II.,"Once more that hope, that dread, that agony,"
13271,II.,That panting expectation! “Oh! reveal
13272,II.,"What must be known, and think what pangs we feel!”"
13273,II.,In vain they ask! The men now landed speak      250
13274,II.,"Confused and quick, and to escape them seek."
13275,II.,"Our female party on a sailor press,      }"
13276,II.,But nothing learn that makes their terror less;      }
13277,II.,"Nothing the man can show, or nothing will confess.      }"
13278,II.,"To some, indeed, they whisper, bringing news"
13279,II.,"For them alone, but others they refuse;"
13280,II.,"And steal away, as if they could not bear"
13281,II.,"The griefs they cause and, if they cause, must share."
13282,II.,"They too are gone! and our unhappy Three,"
13283,II.,"Half wild with fear, are trembling on the quay.      260"
13284,II.,"They can no ease, no peace, no quiet find,"
13285,II.,The storm is gathering in the troubled mind;
13286,II.,"Thoughts after thoughts in wild succession rise,"
13287,II.,And all within is changing like the skies.
13288,II.,"Their friends persuade them, “Do depart, we pray!”      }"
13289,II.,"They will not, must not, cannot go away,      }"
13290,II.,"But chill’d with icy fear, for certain tidings stay.      }"
13291,II.,And now again there must a boat be seen—
13292,II.,Men run together! It must something mean!
13293,II.,"Some figure moves upon the [oozy] bound,      270"
13294,II.,Where flows the tide—Oh! what can he have found—
13295,II.,What lost? And who is he?—The only one
13296,II.,Of the loved three—the Captain’s younger son.
13297,II.,"Their boat was fill’d and sank—He knows no more,"
13298,II.,But that he only hardly reach’d the shore.
13299,II.,He saw them swimming—for he once was near—
13300,II.,"But he was sinking, and he could not hear;"
13301,II.,"And then the waves curl’d round him, but, at length,"
13302,II.,"He struck upon the boat with dying strength,"
13303,II.,"And that preserved him; when he turn’d around,      280}"
13304,II.,"Nought but the dark, wild, billowy flood was found—      }"
13305,II.,"That flood was all he saw, that flood’s the only sound—      }"
13306,II.,"Save that the angry wind, with ceaseless roar,"
13307,II.,Dash’d the wild waves upon the rocky shore.
13308,II.,The Widows dwell together—so we call
13309,II.,The younger woman; widow’d are they all;
13310,II.,"But she, the poor Elizabeth, it seems"
13311,II.,"Not life in her—she lives not, but she dreams;"
13312,II.,"She looks on Philip, and in him can find"
13313,II.,Not much to mark in body or in mind—      290
13314,II.,He who was saved; and then her very soul
13315,II.,"Is in that scene—her thoughts, beyond control,"
13316,II.,"Fix’d on that night, and bearing her along,"
13317,II.,Amid the waters terrible and strong;
13318,II.,Till there she sees within the troubled waves
13319,II.,"The bodies sinking in their wat’ry graves,"
13320,II.,"When from her lover, yielding up his breath,"
13321,II.,"There comes a voice,—“Farewell, Elizabeth!”"
13322,II.,"Yet Resignation in the house is seen,"
13323,II.,"Subdued Affliction, Piety serene,      300"
13324,II.,"And Hope, for ever striving to instil"
13325,II.,The balm for grief—“It is the Heavenly will.”
13326,II.,"And in that will our duty bids us rest,"
13327,II.,"For all that Heaven ordains is good, is best;"
13328,II.,"We sin and suffer—this alone we know,"

13537,II.,"But, or by prudence or by pity moved,      180"
13538,II.,She thought it time his folly was reproved;
13539,II.,"Then took her measures, not perchance without"
13540,II.,Some conscious pride in what she was about.
13541,II.,"Along the brook with gentle pace they go,"
13542,II.,The Youth unconscious of th’ impending woe;
13543,II.,"And oft he urged the absent Maid to talk,"
13544,II.,As she was wont in many a former walk;
13545,II.,"And still she slowly walk’d beside the brook,"
13546,II.,Or look’d around—for what could Fanny look?
13547,II.,"Something there must be! What, did not appear;      190"
13548,II.,"But William’s eye betray’d the anxious fear,"
13549,II.,The cause unseen!——
13550,II.,"But who, with giant-stride,"
13551,II.,"Bounds o’er the brook, and is at Fanny’s side?"
13552,II.,Who takes her arm? and oh! what villain dares
13553,II.,To press those lips? Not even her lips he spares!
13554,II.,"Nay, she herself, the Fanny, the divine,"
13555,II.,Lip to his lip can wickedly incline!
13556,II.,"The lad, unnerved by horror, with an air"
13557,II.,Of wonder quits her arm and looks despair;
13558,II.,"Nor will proceed. Oh no! he must return,      200"
13559,II.,Though his drown’d sight cannot the path discern.
13560,II.,"“Come, Master William! come, Sir, let us on."
13561,II.,What can you fear? You’re not afraid of John?”
13562,II.,"“What ails our youngster?” quoth the burly swain,"
13563,II.,Six feet in height—but he inquires in vain.
13564,II.,"William, in deep resentment, scans the frame"
13565,II.,"Of the fond giant, and abhors his name;"

13568,II.,"Again the monster spake in thoughtless joy,—      210"
13569,II.,"“We shall be married soon, my pretty Boy!"
13570,II.,"And dwell in Madam’s cottage, where you’ll see"

13593,I.,Thus to his Friend an angry Father spoke—
13594,I.,"Nay, do not think that I the WILL revoke."
13595,I.,"My cruel Son in every way I’ve tried,      }"
13596,I.,And every vice have found in him but pride;      }

13598,I.,"Money he wastes, I will not say he spends;      }"
13599,I.,He neither makes the poor nor rich his friends—      }
13600,I.,"To those he nothing gives, to these he never lends.      }"
13601,I.,“’Tis for himself each legal pale he breaks;
13602,I.,He joins the miser’s spirit to the rake’s.      10
13603,I.,"Like the worst Roman in the worst of times,"
13604,I.,He can be guilty of conflicting crimes;
13605,I.,"Greedy of others’ wealth, unknown the use,"
13606,I.,And of his own contemptuously profuse.
13607,I.,"“To such a mind shall I my wealth confide,"
13608,I.,"That you to nobler, worthier ends, may guide?"
13609,I.,"No! let my Will my scorn of vice express,"
13610,I.,And let him learn repentance from distress.”
13611,I.,"So said the Father; and the Friend, who spurn’d"
13612,I.,"Wealth ill-acquired, his sober speech return’d—      20"
13613,I.,"“The youth is faulty, but his faults are weigh’d"
13614,I.,"With a strong bias, and by wrath repaid;"
13615,I.,"Pleasure deludes him, not the vain design"
13616,I.,Of making vices unallied combine.
13617,I.,"He wastes your wealth, for he is yet a boy;"
13618,I.,"He covets more, for he would more enjoy."
13619,I.,"For, my good friend, believe me, very few,      }"
13620,I.,At once are prodigals and misers too—      }
13621,I.,The spendthrift vice engrafted on the Jew.      }
13622,I.,Leave me one thousand pounds; for I confess      30
13623,I.,"I have my wants, and will not tax you less."
13624,I.,But your estate let this young man enjoy:
13625,I.,"If he reforms, you’ve saved a grateful boy;"
13626,I.,"If not, a father’s cares and troubles cease,"
13627,I.,"You’ve done your duty, and may rest in peace.”"
13628,I.,"The Will in hand, the Father musing stood,"
13629,I.,"Then gravely answered, “Your advice is good;"
13630,I.,"Yet take the paper, and in safety keep;"
13631,I.,I’ll make another Will before I sleep;
13632,I.,"But, if I hear of some atrocious deed,      40"
13633,I.,"That deed I’ll burn, and yours will then succeed."
13634,I.,Two thousand I bequeath you. No reproof!
13635,I.,And there are small bequests—he’ll have enough;
13636,I.,"For, if he wastes, he would with all be poor;"
13637,I.,"And, if he wastes not, he will need no more.”"
13638,I.,"The Friends then parted; this the Will possess’d,"
13639,I.,And that another made—so things had rest.
13640,I.,"George, who was conscious that his Father grew"

13644,I.,"No fierce reproaches from deserted fair,"

13651,I.,"He sought his father’s closet, search’d around,"
13652,I.,To find a Will: the important Will was found.      60
13653,I.,"Well pleased he read, “These lands, this manor, all,"
13654,I.,Now call me master!—I obey the call.”
13655,I.,"Then from the window look’d the valley o’er,"
13656,I.,And never saw it look so rich before.
13657,I.,"He viewed the dairy, view’d the men at plough,      }"
13658,I.,"With other eyes, with other feelings now,      }"

13675,I.,"’Tis all his hand, no lawyer was employ’d"
13676,I.,"To write this prose, that ought to be destroy’d!"
13677,I.,To no attorney would my father trust:
13678,I.,He wished his son to judge of what was just;
13679,I.,"As if he said, ‘My boy will find the Will,"
13680,I.,"And, as he likes, destroy it or fulfil.’"
13681,I.,"This now is reason, this I understand—"
13682,I.,"What was at his, is now at my, command.      90"
13683,I.,"As for this paper, with these cousiny names,"
13684,I.,I—’tis _my_ Will—commit it to the flames.

13709,I.,They are in private—all about is still—
13710,I.,"When thus the Guest:—“Your father left a Will,"
13711,I.,"And I would see it.”—Rising in reply,"
13712,I.,"The youth beheld a fix’d and piercing eye,      120"
13713,I.,From which his own receded; and the sound
13714,I.,Of his own words was in disorder drown’d.
13715,I.,He answered softly—“I in vain have spent

13722,I.,"“Two days I give you; to my words attend,”      130"
13723,I.,"Was the reply, “and let the business end.”"
13724,I.,"Two days were past, and still the same reply"
13725,I.,To the same question—“Not a Will have I.”
13726,I.,"More grave, more earnest, then the Friend appear’d;"
13727,I.,"He spoke with power, as one who would be heard—"
13728,I.,“A Will your father made! I witness’d one.”
13729,I.,"The Heir arose in anger—“Sir, begone!"
13730,I.,Think you my spirit by your looks to awe?
13731,I.,"Go to your lodgings, friend, or to your law."
13732,I.,To what would you our easy souls persuade?      140
13733,I.,"Once more I tell you, not a Will was made;"
13734,I.,"There’s none with me, I swear it—now, deny"

13736,I.,"“That, surely, cannot I;"
13737,I.,"Nay, I believe you, and, as no such deed"
13738,I.,"Is found with you, _this_ surely will succeed!”—"
13739,I.,"He said, and from his pocket slowly drew      }"
13740,I.,"Of the first testament a copy true,      }"
13741,I.,"And held it spread abroad, that he might see it too.      }"
13742,I.,"“Read, and be sure; your parent’s pleasure see—"
13743,I.,Then leave this mansion and these lands to me.”      150
13744,I.,"He said, and terror seized the guilty youth;"
13745,I.,"He saw his misery, meanness, and the truth;"
13746,I.,"Could not before his stern accuser stand,"
13747,I.,"Yet could not quit that hall, that park, that land;"

13749,I.,Began to think in law to find relief.
13750,I.,"“While courts are open, why should I despair?"
13751,I.,Juries will feel for an abandon’d heir.

13753,I.,"“I must submit,” recurring fear replied.      160"
13754,I.,"As wheels the vane when winds around it play,"
13755,I.,So his strong passions turn’d him every way;

13892,I.,"For a young rake, to place him in her way,      30"
13893,I.,Or once admit him in his Uncle’s view;
13894,I.,"“But these,” said he, “are things that women do.”"
13895,I.,"Thus were the Cousins, young, unguarded, fond,"
13896,I.,Bound in true friendship—so they named the bond—
13897,I.,"Nor call’d it love—and James resolved, when free,"
13898,I.,A most correct and frugal man to be.
13899,I.,"He sought her prayers, but not for heavenly aid:"
13900,I.,"“Pray to my Uncle,” and she kindly pray’d—"
13901,I.,"“James will be careful,” said the Niece; “and I"
13902,I.,"Will be as careful,” was the stern reply.      40"
13903,I.,"Thus he resisted, and I know not how"
13904,I.,He could be soften’d—Is he kinder now?
13905,I.,Hard was his heart; but yet a heart of steel
13906,I.,"May melt in dying, and dissolving feel."
13907,I.,
13908,I.,
13909,II.,II.
13910,II.,
13911,II.,"_F._ What were his feelings I cannot explain,"
13912,II.,His actions only on my mind remain.
13913,II.,"He never married, that indeed we know,"
13914,II.,"But childless was not, as his foes could show—"
13915,II.,"Perhaps his friends—for friends, as well as foes,"
13916,II.,Will the infirmities of man disclose.      50
13917,II.,"When young, our Merchant, though of sober fame,"
13918,II.,Had a rude passion that he could not tame;
13919,II.,"And, not to dwell upon the passion’s strife,"
13920,II.,"He had a Son, who never had a wife;"
13921,II.,"The father paid just what the law required,"
13922,II.,"Nor saw the infant, nor to see desired."
13923,II.,"That infant, thriving on the parish fare,"
13924,II.,"Without a parent’s love, consent, or care,"
13925,II.,"Became a sailor, and sustain’d his part"
13926,II.,"So like a man, it touch’d his father’s heart.—      60"
13927,II.,"He for protection gave the ready pay,"
13928,II.,And placed the seaman in preferment’s way;
13929,II.,"Who doubted not, with sanguine heart, to rise,"
13930,II.,"And bring home riches, gain’d from many a prize."
13931,II.,"But Jack—for so we call’d him—Jack once more,"
13932,II.,"And never after, touch’d his native shore;"
13933,II.,"Nor was it known if he in battle fell,"
13934,II.,"Or sickening died—we sought, but none could tell."
13935,II.,"The father sigh’d—as some report, he wept;"
13936,II.,And then his sorrow with the Sailor slept;      70
13937,II.,"Then age came on; he found his spirits droop,"
13938,II.,And his kind Niece remain’d the only hope.
13939,II.,"Premising this, our story then proceeds—"
13940,II.,Our gentle Patty for her Cousin pleads;
13941,II.,"And now her Uncle, to his room confined,"
13942,II.,"And kindly nursed, was soften’d and was kind."
13943,II.,"James, whom the law had from his prison sent,      }"
13944,II.,"With much contrition to his Uncle went,      }"
13945,II.,"And, humbly kneeling, said, “Forgive me, I repent.”      }"
13946,II.,"Reproach, of course, his humbled spirit bore;      80"
13947,II.,He knew for pardon anger opes the door;
13948,II.,"The man, whom we with too much warmth reprove,"
13949,II.,Has the best chance our softening hearts to move;
13950,II.,"And this he had—“Why, Patty, love! it seems,”"
13951,II.,"Said the old man, “there’s something good in James;"
13952,II.,"I must forgive; but you my child, are yet"
13953,II.,My stay and prop; I cannot this forget.
13954,II.,"Still, my dear Niece, as a reforming man,"
13955,II.,"I mean to aid your Cousin, if I can.”"
13956,II.,Then Patty smiled; for James and she had now      90
13957,II.,"Time for their loves, and pledged the constant vow."
13958,II.,James the fair way to favouring thoughts discern’d—
13959,II.,"He learn’d the news, and told of all he learn’d;"
13960,II.,"Read all the papers in an easy style,"
13961,II.,And knew the bits would raise his Uncle’s smile;
13962,II.,"Then would refrain, to hear the good man say,"
13963,II.,“You did not come as usual yesterday;
13964,II.,"I must not take you from your duties, lad,"
13965,II.,But of your daily visits should be glad!”
13966,II.,Patty was certain that their Uncle now      100
13967,II.,Would their affection all it ask’d allow;
13968,II.,She was convinced her lover now would find
13969,II.,The past forgotten and old Uncle kind.
13970,II.,"“It matters not,” she added, “who receives"
13971,II.,The larger portion; what to one he leaves
13972,II.,"We both inherit! let us nothing hide,"
13973,II.,"Dear James, from him in whom we both confide.”"
13974,II.,“Not for your life!” quoth James. “Let Uncle choose
13975,II.,Our ways for us—or we the way shall lose.
13976,II.,"For know you, Cousin, all these miser men”——      110"
13977,II.,"“Nay, my dear James!”—"
13978,II.,"“Our worthy Uncle, then,"
13979,II.,"And all, like Uncle, like to be obey’d"
13980,II.,"By their dependants, who must seem afraid"
13981,II.,"Of their own will.—If we to wed incline,"
13982,II.,"You’ll quickly hear him peevishly repine,"
13983,II.,"Object, dispute, and sundry reasons give,"
13984,II.,To prove we ne’er could find the means to live;
13985,II.,"And then, due credit for his speech to gain,"
13986,II.,He’ll leave us poor—lest wealth should prove it vain.
13987,II.,"Let him propose the measure, and then we      120"
13988,II.,May for his pleasure to his plan agree.
13989,II.,"I, when at last assenting, shall be still"
13990,II.,But giving way to a kind Uncle’s will;
13991,II.,"Then will he deem it just, amends to make"
13992,II.,To one who ventures all things for his sake;
13993,II.,"So, should you deign to take this worthless hand,"
13994,II.,"Be sure, dear Patty, ’tis at his command!”"
13995,II.,"But Patty questioned—“Is it, let me ask,"
13996,II.,The will of God that we should wear a mask?”
13997,II.,"This startled James: he lifted up his eyes,      130"
13998,II.,"And said with some contempt, besides surprise,"
13999,II.,"“Patty, my love! the will of God, ’tis plain,"
14000,II.,Is that we live by what we can obtain;
14001,II.,"Shall we a weak and foolish man offend,"
14002,II.,And when our trial is so near our end?”
14003,II.,"This hurt the maiden, and she said, “’Tis well!"
14004,II.,"Unask’d I will not of your purpose tell,"
14005,II.,But will not lie.”—
14006,II.,"“Lie! Patty, no, indeed;"
14007,II.,Your downright lying never will succeed!
14008,II.,A better way our prudence may devise      140
14009,II.,Than such unprofitable things as lies.
14010,II.,"Yet, a dependant, if he would not starve,"
14011,II.,"The way through life must with discretion carve,"
14012,II.,"And, though a lie he may with pride disdain,"
14013,II.,He must not every useless truth maintain.
14014,II.,"If one respect to these fond men would show,"
14015,II.,Conceal the facts that give them pain to know;
14016,II.,"While all that pleases may be placed in view,"
14017,II.,"And, if it be not, they will think it true.”"
14018,II.,"The humble Patty dropp’d a silent tear,      150"
14019,II.,"And said, “Indeed, ’tis best to be sincere.”"
14020,II.,James answer’d not—there could be no reply
14021,II.,To what he would not grant nor could deny;
14022,II.,But from that time he in the maiden saw
14023,II.,What he condemn’d; yet James was kept in awe.
14024,II.,"He felt her virtue, but was sore afraid"
14025,II.,For the frank blunders of the virtuous maid.
14026,II.,Meantime he daily to his Uncle read
14027,II.,"The news, and to his favourite subjects led:"
14028,II.,"If closely press’d, he sometimes staid to dine,      160"
14029,II.,"Eat of one dish, and drank one glass of wine;"
14030,II.,"For James was crafty grown, and felt his way"
14031,II.,"To favour, step by step, and day by day;"
14032,II.,"He talk’d of business, till the Uncle prized"
14033,II.,"The lad’s opinion, whom he once despised,"
14034,II.,"And, glad to see him thus his faults survive,"
14035,II.,"“This Boy,” quoth he, “will keep our name alive."
14036,II.,"Women are weak, and Patty, though the best"
14037,II.,"Of her weak sex, is woman like the rest:"
14038,II.,"An idle husband will her money spend,      170"
14039,II.,And bring my hard-earn’d savings to an end.”
14040,II.,"Far as he dared, his Nephew this way led,"
14041,II.,"And told his tales of lasses rashly wed,"
14042,II.,"Told them as matters that “He heard, he knew"
14043,II.,"Not where,” he said—“they might be false or true:"
14044,II.,One must confess that girls are apt to dote
14045,II.,On the bright scarlet of a coxcomb’s coat;
14046,II.,And that with ease a woman they beguile
14047,II.,"With a fool’s flattery, or a rascal’s smile;—"
14048,II.,"But then,” he added, fearing to displease,      180"
14049,II.,“Our Patty never saw such men as these.”
14050,II.,“True! but she may—some scoundrel may command
14051,II.,"The girl’s whole store, if he can gain her hand."
14052,II.,"Her very goodness will itself deceive,"
14053,II.,And her weak virtue help her to believe;
14054,II.,"Yet she is kind; and, Nephew! go, and say,"
14055,II.,I need her now—You’ll come another day.”
14056,II.,"In such discourses, while the maiden went"
14057,II.,"About her household, many an hour was spent,"
14058,II.,"Till James was sure that when his Uncle died,      190}"
14059,II.,He should at least the property divide;      }
14060,II.,Nor long had he to wait—the fact was quickly tried.      }
14061,II.,"The Uncle now, to his last bed confined,"
14062,II.,To James and Patty his affairs resign’d;
14063,II.,The doctor took his final fee in hand;
14064,II.,The man of law received his last command;
14065,II.,"The silent priest sat watching in his chair,"
14066,II.,If he might wake the dying man to prayer—
14067,II.,"When the last groan was heard; then all was still,"
14068,II.,And James indulged his musings—on the Will.      200
14069,II.,"This in due time was read, and Patty saw"
14070,II.,Her own dear Cousin made the heir-by-law.
14071,II.,"Something indeed was hers, but yet she felt"
14072,II.,As if her Uncle had not kindly dealt;
14073,II.,"And but that James was one whom she could trust,"
14074,II.,She would have thought it cruel and unjust.
14075,II.,"Ev’n as it was, it gave her some surprise,"
14076,II.,And tears unbidden started in her eyes;
14077,II.,"Yet she confess’d it was the same to her,"
14078,II.,And it was likely men would men prefer.      210
14079,II.,Loth was the Niece to think her Uncle wrong;
14080,II.,And other thoughts engaged her—“Is it long
14081,II.,"That custom bids us tarry ere we wed,"
14082,II.,When a kind Uncle is so lately dead?
14083,II.,"At any rate,” the maiden judged, “’tis he"
14084,II.,That first will speak—it does not rest with me.”
14085,II.,"James to the Will his every thought confined,"
14086,II.,And found some parts that vex’d his sober mind.
14087,II.,"He, getting much, to angry thoughts gave way,"
14088,II.,"For the poor pittance that he had to pay,      220"
14089,II.,"With Patty’s larger claim. Save these alone,"
14090,II.,The weeping heir beheld the whole his own;
14091,II.,Yet something painful in his mind would dwell—
14092,II.,"It was not likely, but was possible—”"
14093,II.,"No—Fortune lately was to James so kind,"
14094,II.,He was determined not to think her blind:
14095,II.,"She saw his merit, and would never throw"
14096,II.,His prospects down by such malicious blow.”
14097,II.,"Patty, meanwhile, had quite enough betray’d"
14098,II.,Of her own mind to make her James afraid      230
14099,II.,Of one so simply pure: his hardening heart
14100,II.,Inclined to anger—he resolved to part.
14101,II.,"Why marry Patty?—if he look’d around,"
14102,II.,More advantageous matches might be found;
14103,II.,"But, though he might a richer wife command,"
14104,II.,He first must break her hold upon his hand.
14105,II.,She with a spinster-friend retired awhile—
14106,II.,"“Not long,” she said—and said it with a smile."
14107,II.,Not so had James determined.—He essay’d
14108,II.,To move suspicion in the gentle maid.      240
14109,II.,"Words not succeeding, he design’d to pass"
14110,II.,The spinster’s window with some forward lass.
14111,II.,"If in her heart so pure no pang was known,"
14112,II.,At least he might affect it in his own.
14113,II.,"There was a brother of her friend, and he,"
14114,II.,"Though poor and rude, might serve for jealousy."
14115,II.,"If all should fail, he, though of schemes bereft,"
14116,II.,"Might leave her yet!—They fail’d, and she was left."
14117,II.,"Poor Patty bore it with a woman’s mind,"
14118,II.,"And with an angel’s, sorrowing and resign’d.      250"
14119,II.,"Ere this in secret long she wept and pray’d,"
14120,II.,Long tried to think her lover but delay’d
14121,II.,"The union, once his hope, his prayer, his pride;—"
14122,II.,She could in James as in herself confide:
14123,II.,"Was he not bound by all that man can bind,"
14124,II.,"In love, in honour, to be just and kind?"
14125,II.,"Large was his debt, and, when their debts are large,"
14126,II.,The ungrateful cancel what the just discharge;
14127,II.,"Nor payment only in their pride refuse,"
14128,II.,"But first they wrong their friend, and then accuse.      260"
14129,II.,"Thus Patty finds her bosom’s claims denied,"
14130,II.,"Her love insulted, and her right defied."
14131,II.,"She urged it not; her claim the maid withdrew,      }"
14132,II.,For maiden pride would not the wretch pursue;      }
14133,II.,"She sigh’d to find him false, herself so good and true.      }"
14134,II.,"Now all his fears, at least the present, still—"
14135,II.,"He talk’d, good man! about his uncle’s will—"
14136,II.,"“All unexpected,” he declared—“surprised"
14137,II.,Was he—and his good uncle ill-advised.
14138,II.,"He no such luck had look’d for, he was sure,      270"
14139,II.,"Nor such deserved,” he said, with look demure;"
14140,II.,“He did not merit such exceeding love;
14141,II.,"But his, he meant, so help him God, to prove.”"
14142,II.,And he has proved it! all his cares and schemes
14143,II.,Have proved the exceeding love James bears to James.
14144,II.,But to proceed—for we have yet the facts
14145,II.,That show how Justice looks on wicked acts;
14146,II.,"For, though not always, she at times appears—"
14147,II.,To wake in man her salutary fears.
14148,II.,"James, restless grown—for no such mind can rest—      280"
14149,II.,"Would build a house, that should his wealth attest;"
14150,II.,"In fact, he saw, in many a clouded face,      }"
14151,II.,"A certain token of his own disgrace,      }"
14152,II.,And wish’d to overawe the murmurs of the place.      }
14153,II.,"The finish’d building show’d the master’s wealth,"
14154,II.,And noisy workmen drank his Honour’s health—
14155,II.,“His and his heirs”—and at the thoughtless word
14156,II.,A strange commotion in his bosom stirr’d.
14157,II.,“‘Heirs!’ said the idiots?”—and again that clause
14158,II.,In the strange Will corrected their applause.      290
14159,II.,Prophetic fears! for now reports arose
14160,II.,That spoil’d “his Honour’s” comforts and repose.
14161,II.,"A stout young Sailor, though in battle maim’d,"
14162,II.,"Arrived in port, and his possessions claim’d."
14163,II.,"The Will he read: he stated his demand,"
14164,II.,And his attorney grasp’d at house and land.
14165,II.,"The Will provided—“If my son survive,"
14166,II.,He shall inherit;” and lo! Jack’s alive!
14167,II.,"Yes! he was that lost lad, preserved by fate,"
14168,II.,And now was bent on finding his estate.      300
14169,II.,"But claim like this the angry James denied,"
14170,II.,And to the law the sturdy heir applied.
14171,II.,James did what men when placed like him would do—
14172,II.,"Avow’d his right, and fee’d his lawyer too:"
14173,II.,"The Will, indeed, provided for a son;"
14174,II.,But was this Sailor youth the very one?
14175,II.,"Ere Jack’s strong proofs in all their strength were shown,      }"
14176,II.,To gain a part James used a milder tone;      }
14177,II.,But the instructed tar would reign alone.      }
14178,II.,At last he reign’d: to James a large bequest      310
14179,II.,Was frankly dealt; the Seaman had the rest—
14180,II.,"Save a like portion to the gentle Niece,"
14181,II.,"Who lived in comfort, and regain’d her peace."
14182,II.,"In her neat room her talent she employ’d,"
14183,II.,With more true peace than ever James enjoy’d.
14184,II.,"The young, the aged, in her praise agreed—"
14185,II.,"Meek in her manner, bounteous in her deed;"
14186,II.,The very children their respect avow’d:
14187,II.,"“’Twas the good lady,” they were told, and bow’d."
14188,II.,The merry Seaman much the maid approv’d—      320
14189,II.,Nor that alone—he like a seaman loved;
14190,II.,Loved as a man who did not much complain;
14191,II.,"Loved like a sailor, not a sighing swain;"
14192,II.,"Had heard of wooing maids, but knew not how—"
14193,II.,"“Lass, if you love me, prithee tell me now,”"
14194,II.,Was his address—but this was nothing cold—
14195,II.,“Tell if you love me;” and she smiled and told.
14196,II.,"He brought her presents, such as sailors buy,      }"
14197,II.,"Glittering like gold, to please a maiden’s eye,      }"
14198,II.,"All silk and silver, fringe and finery;      330}"
14199,II.,"These she accepted in respect to him,"
14200,II.,And thought but little of the missing limb.
14201,II.,"Of this he told her, for he loved to tell"
14202,II.,"A warlike tale, and judged he told it well:—"
14203,II.,"“You mark me, love! the French were two to one,"
14204,II.,"And so, you see, they were ashamed to run;"
14205,II.,We fought an hour; and then there came the shot
14206,II.,That struck me here—a man must take his lot;—
14207,II.,"A minute after, and the Frenchman struck:"
14208,II.,One minute sooner had been better luck;      340
14209,II.,"But, if you can a crippled cousin like,"
14210,II.,You ne’er shall see him for a trifle strike.”
14211,II.,"Patty, whose gentle heart was not so nice"
14212,II.,"As to reject the thought of loving twice,"
14213,II.,"Judged her new Cousin was by nature kind,"
14214,II.,"With no suspicions in his honest mind,"
14215,II.,Such as our virtuous ladies now and then
14216,II.,Find strongly floating in the minds of men.
14217,II.,"So they were married, and the lasses vow’d"
14218,II.,That Patty’s luck would make an angel proud:      350
14219,II.,“Not but that time would come when she must prove
14220,II.,"That men are men, no matter how they love!”—"
14221,II.,And she has prov’d it; for she finds her man
14222,II.,As kind and true as when their loves began.
14223,II.,"James is unhappy; not that he is poor,"
14224,II.,"But, having much, because he has no more;"
14225,II.,Because a rival’s pleasure gives him pain;
14226,II.,Because his vices work’d their way in vain;
14227,II.,"And, more than these, because he sees the smile"
14228,II.,Of a wrong’d woman pitying man so vile.      360
14229,II.,"He sought an office, serves in the excise,      }"
14230,II.,"And every wish, but that for wealth, denies;      }"
14231,II.,"Wealth is the world to him, and he is worldly wise.      }"
14232,II.,But disappointment in his face appears;      }
14233,II.,"Care and vexation, sad regret and fears      }"
14234,II.,"Have fix’d on him their fangs, and done the work of years.      }"
14235,II.,"Yet grows he wealthy in a strange degree,"
14236,II.,And neighbours wonder how the fact can be.
14237,II.,"He lives alone, contracts a sordid air,"
14238,II.,And sees with sullen grief the cheerful pair;      370
14239,II.,"Feels a keen pang, as he beholds the door"
14240,II.,"Where peace abides, and mutters—“_I am poor!_”"

14248,I.,I.
14249,I.,
14250,I.,_P._ What I have ask’d are questions that relate
14251,I.,"To those once known, that I might learn their fate."
14252,I.,"But there was ONE, whom though I scarcely knew,"
14253,I.,Much do I wish to learn his fortunes too.
14254,I.,"Yet what expect?—He was a rich man’s Heir,"
14255,I.,"His conduct doubtful, but his prospects fair;"
14256,I.,"Thoughtless and brave, extravagant and gay,"
14257,I.,"Wild as the wind, and open as the day;"
14258,I.,His freaks and follies were a thousand times
14259,I.,Brought full in view; I heard not of his crimes.      10
14260,I.,"Like our Prince Hal, his company he chose"
14261,I.,"Among the lawless, of restraint the foes;"
14262,I.,"But, though to their poor pleasures he could stoop,"
14263,I.,"He was not, rumour said, their victim-dupe."
14264,I.,"His mother’s Sister was a maiden prim,"
14265,I.,"Pious and poor, and much in debt to him."
14266,I.,"This she repaid with volumes of reproof,"
14267,I.,"And sage advice, till he would cry “Enough!”"
14268,I.,His father’s Brother no such hints allow’d—
14269,I.,"Peevish and rich, and insolent and proud,      20"
14270,I.,"Of stern, strong spirit. Him the Youth withstood,"
14271,I.,At length; “Presume not” (said he) “on our blood!
14272,I.,"Treat with politeness him whom you advise,"
14273,I.,Nor think I fear your doting prophecies!”
14274,I.,"And fame has told of many an angry word,"
14275,I.,"When anger this, and that contempt had stirr’d."
14276,I.,"“Boy! thou wilt beg thy bread, I plainly see.”—"
14277,I.,"“Upbraid not, Uncle! till I beg of thee.”—"
14278,I.,“Oh! thou wilt run to ruin and disgrace.”—
14279,I.,“What! and so kind an Uncle in the place?”—      30
14280,I.,"“Nay, for I hold thee stranger to my blood.”—"
14281,I.,“Then must I treat thee as a stranger would;
14282,I.,"For, if you throw the tie of blood aside,"
14283,I.,You must the roughness of your speech abide.”—
14284,I.,“What! to your father’s Brother do you give
14285,I.,A challenge?—Mercy! in what times we live!”
14286,I.,"Now, I confess, the youth who could supply"
14287,I.,"Thus that poor Spinster, and could thus defy"
14288,I.,This wealthy Uncle;—who could mix with them
14289,I.,"Whom his strong sense and feeling must condemn,      40"
14290,I.,"And in their follies his amusement find,"
14291,I.,Yet never lose the vigour of his mind—
14292,I.,"A youth like this, with much we must reprove,"
14293,I.,Had something still to win esteem and love.
14294,I.,Perhaps he lives not; but he seem’d not made
14295,I.,To pass through life entirely in the shade.
14296,I.,_F._ Suppose you saw him—does your mind retain
14297,I.,"So much, that you would know the man again?"
14298,I.,"Yet hold in mind, he may have felt the press"
14299,I.,"Of grief or guilt, the withering of distress;      50"
14300,I.,"He now may show the stamp of woe and pain,"
14301,I.,And nothing of his lively cast remain.
14302,I.,Survey these features—see if nothing there
14303,I.,May old impressions on your mind repair!
14304,I.,Is there not something in this shattered frame
14305,I.,Like to that—
14306,I.,"_P._ No! not like it, but the same;"
14307,I.,"That eye so brilliant, and that smile so gay,"
14308,I.,"Are lighted up, and sparkle through decay."
14309,I.,But may I question? Will you that allow?
14310,I.,"There was a difference, and there must be now;      60"
14311,I.,"And yet, permitted, I would gladly hear"
14312,I.,What must have pass’d in many a troubled year.
14313,I.,
14314,I.,*       *       *       *       *
14315,I.,
14316,I.,_F._ Then hear my tale; but I the price demand:      }
14317,I.,"That understood, I too must understand      }"
14318,I.,"Thy wanderings through, or sufferings in, the land;      }"
14319,I.,"And, if our virtues cannot much produce,"
14320,I.,Perhaps our errors may be found of use.
14321,I.,"To all the wealth my Father’s care laid by,"
14322,I.,"I added wings, and taught it how to fly."
14323,I.,To him that act had been of grievous sight;      70
14324,I.,But he survived not to behold the flight.
14325,I.,"Strange doth it seem to grave and sober minds,"
14326,I.,"How the dear vice the simple votary blinds,"
14327,I.,"So that he goes to ruin smoothly on,"
14328,I.,"And scarcely feels he’s going, till he’s gone."
14329,I.,"I had made over, in a lucky hour,"
14330,I.,"Funds for my Aunt, and placed beyond my power:"
14331,I.,"The rest was flown, I speak it with remorse,"
14332,I.,And now a pistol seem’d a thing in course.
14333,I.,"But, though its precepts I had not obey’d,      80"
14334,I.,Thoughts of my Bible made me much afraid
14335,I.,"Of such rebellion, and, though not content,"
14336,I.,I must live on when life’s supports were spent;
14337,I.,"Nay, I must eat, and of my frugal Aunt"
14338,I.,Must grateful take what gracious she would grant;
14339,I.,"And true, she granted, but with much discourse—"
14340,I.,Oh! with what words did she her sense enforce!
14341,I.,"Great was her wonder, in my need that I"
14342,I.,Should on the prop myself had raised rely—
14343,I.,"I, who provided for her in my care,      90"
14344,I.,“Must be assured how little she could spare!”
14345,I.,"I stood confounded, and with angry tone,"
14346,I.,"With rage and grief, that blended oath and groan,"
14347,I.,I fled her presence—yet I saw her air
14348,I.,"Of resignation, and I heard her prayer;"
14349,I.,"“Now Heaven,” she utter’d, “make his burden light!”"
14350,I.,"And I, in parting, cried, “Thou hypocrite!”"
14351,I.,But I was wrong—she might have meant to pray;
14352,I.,Though not to give her soul—her cash—away.
14353,I.,"Of course, my Uncle would the spendthrift shun;      100"
14354,I.,So friends on earth I now could reckon none.
14355,I.,"One morn I rambled, thinking of the past,"
14356,I.,Far in the country—Did you ever fast
14357,I.,"Through a long summer’s day? or, sturdy, go"
14358,I.,"To pluck the crab, the bramble, and the sloe,"
14359,I.,"The hyp, the cornel, and the beech, the food"
14360,I.,And the wild solace of the gypsy brood?
14361,I.,"To pick the cress, embrown’d by summer sun,"
14362,I.,From the dry bed where streams no longer run?
14363,I.,"Have you, like school-boy, mingling play and toil,      110"
14364,I.,"Dug for the ground-nut, and enjoy’d the spoil?"
14365,I.,"Or chafed with feverish hand the ripening wheat,"
14366,I.,"Resolved to fast, and yet compell’d to eat?"
14367,I.,"Say, did you this, and drink the crystal spring,"
14368,I.,"And think yourself an abdicated king,"
14369,I.,Driv’n from your state by a rebellious race?
14370,I.,"And, in your pride contending with disgrace,"
14371,I.,"Could you your hunger in your anger lose,"
14372,I.,And call the ills you bear the ways you choose?
14373,I.,"Thus, on myself depending, I began      120"
14374,I.,To feel the pride of a neglected man;
14375,I.,"Not yet correct, but still I could command"
14376,I.,"Unshaken nerves, and a determined hand."
14377,I.,"“Lo! men at work!” I said, “and I, a man,"
14378,I.,"Can work! I feel it is my pride, I can.”"
14379,I.,"This said, I wander’d on, and join’d the poor,"
14380,I.,"Assumed a labourer’s dress, and was no more"
14381,I.,Than labour made—Upon the road I broke
14382,I.,"Stones for my bread, and startled at the stroke;"
14383,I.,"But every day the labour seem’d more light,      130"
14384,I.,"And sounder, sweeter still the sleep of every night."
14385,I.,"“Thus will I live,” I cried, “nor more return"
14386,I.,"To herd with men, whose love and hate I spurn."
14387,I.,"All creatures toil; the beast, if tamed or free,"
14388,I.,Must toil for daily sustenance like me;
14389,I.,"The feather’d people hunt as well as sing,"
14390,I.,And catch their flying food upon the wing.
14391,I.,"The fish, the insect, all who live, employ"
14392,I.,"Their powers to keep on life, or to enjoy,"
14393,I.,"Their life th’ enjoyment; thus will I proceed,      140"
14394,I.,A man from man’s detested favours freed.”
14395,I.,"Thus was I reasoning, when at length there came"
14396,I.,"A gift, a present, but without a name."
14397,I.,"“That Spinster-witch, has she then found a way"
14398,I.,"To cure her conscience, and her Nephew pay,"
14399,I.,"And sends her pittance? Well, and let it buy"
14400,I.,What sweetens labour; need I this deny?
14401,I.,I thank her not; it is as if I found
14402,I.,The fairy-gift upon this stony ground.”
14403,I.,"Still I wrought on; again occurred the day,      150"
14404,I.,And then the same addition to my pay.
14405,I.,"Then, lo! another Friend, if not the same,"
14406,I.,"For that I knew not, with a message came—"
14407,I.,“Canst keep accounts?” the man was pleased to ask—
14408,I.,“I could not cash!—but that the harder task.”
14409,I.,"“Yet try,” he said; and I was quickly brought"
14410,I.,"To Lawyer Snell, and in his office taught."
14411,I.,"Not much my pay, but my desires were less,"
14412,I.,And I for evil days reserved th’ excess.
14413,I.,"Such day occurr’d not: quickly came there one,      160"
14414,I.,When I was told my present work was done.
14415,I.,"My Friend then brought me to a building large,"
14416,I.,And gave far weightier business to my charge.
14417,I.,There I was told I had accounts to keep
14418,I.,"Of those vast Works, where wonders never sleep,"
14419,I.,"Where spindles, bobbins, rovings, threads, and pins,"
14420,I.,[Make] up the complex mass that ever spins.
14421,I.,"There, at my desk, in my six feet of room,"
14422,I.,I noted every power of every loom;
14423,I.,Sounds of all kinds I heard from mortal lungs—      170
14424,I.,"Eternal battle of unwearied tongues,"
14425,I.,"The jar of men and women, girls and boys,"
14426,I.,"And the huge Babel’s own dull whirring, grinding noise."
14427,I.,"My care was mark’d, and I had soon in charge"
14428,I.,"Important matters, and my pay was large."
14429,I.,"I at my fortune marvell’d; it was strange,"
14430,I.,"And so the outward and the inward change,"
14431,I.,Till to the Power who “gives and takes away”
14432,I.,"I turn’d in praise, and taught my soul to pray."
14433,I.,"Another came! “I come,” he said, “to show,      180"
14434,I.,Your unknown Friend—have you a wish to know?”
14435,I.,"Much I desired, and forth we rode, and found"
14436,I.,"My Uncle dying, but his judgment sound."
14437,I.,"The good old man, whom I abused, had been"
14438,I.,"The guardian power, directing but unseen;"
14439,I.,And thus the wild but grateful boy he led
14440,I.,To take new motives at his dying bed.
14441,I.,The rest you judge—I now have all I need—
14442,I.,"And now the tale you promised!—Come, proceed."

14465,I.,_P._ This might be done; but wonders I have none;

14467,I.,"_F._ What then? I grant you, if your way was clear,"

14590,EPISTLE I.,I behold so much Deviltry drop from the Press;
14591,EPISTLE I.,"But this is a Subject I will not say much on,"
14592,EPISTLE I.,Because what hereafter I purpose to touch on.      30
14593,EPISTLE I.,"At present to all, in their several Degrees,"
14594,EPISTLE I.,I pay my Respect in such Verses as these;
14595,EPISTLE I.,"And, my rough-moving Lines should your Critics condemn,"
14596,EPISTLE I.,I shall talk in a much rougher Language to them.
14597,EPISTLE I.,Ye Monarchs! Ye Rulers of Nations! attend
14598,EPISTLE I.,"To a Ruler, your Equal! the first Monarch’s Friend!"
14599,EPISTLE I.,"Whose Empire at least is as large as your own,"
14600,EPISTLE I.,"As crowded his Army, as splendid his Throne;"
14601,EPISTLE I.,"His Spirit as great, and, whatever his Cause,"
14602,EPISTLE I.,A greater Obedience is paid to his Laws!      40
14603,EPISTLE I.,Attend and receive your Instructions from me;
14604,EPISTLE I.,"Though a Counsellor famous, I covet no fee;"
14605,EPISTLE I.,Prefer me before all your ignoble Tribe—
14606,EPISTLE I.,What Mortal in Black ever acts without Bribe?
14607,EPISTLE I.,Let Empire unbounded your Bosoms possess;
14608,EPISTLE I.,"You’re as noble as Cæsar, and scorn to be less."
14609,EPISTLE I.,Be your Counsellors such as may aid your Designs—
14610,EPISTLE I.,"Good Jockeys, great Gamblers, rare Judges of Wines!"
14611,EPISTLE I.,"And then, should you happen to fail in your Ends,"
14612,EPISTLE I.,"Your People may lay all the Blame on your Friends,      50"
14613,EPISTLE I.,"And say, “’tis a pity a Monarch so just"
14614,EPISTLE I.,Such a pack of damn’d Villainous Fellows should trust.”
14615,EPISTLE I.,Nor judge in this Case my Advice is confin’d:
14616,EPISTLE I.,"Be it common as Air, and as free as the Wind;"
14617,EPISTLE I.,"Obey’d in the Climes which Sol scarce can appear in,"
14618,EPISTLE I.,Caress’d in the Countries he passes the year in!
14619,EPISTLE I.,Nor would I like him from my Friends fly away:
14620,EPISTLE I.,"Wherever I’m courted I constantly stay,"
14621,EPISTLE I.,"To Spain, France, or Flanders extending my Care,"
14622,EPISTLE I.,And England! in spite of my Enemies there.      60
14623,EPISTLE I.,"With its monarch of old I was social and free,"
14624,EPISTLE I.,And the Present must die—that’s some Comfort to me.
14625,EPISTLE I.,"Believe me, my Brethren—for when I advise"
14626,EPISTLE I.,"I always speak Truth, tho’ the Father of Lies—"
14627,EPISTLE I.,’Tis a foolish Mistake to imagine Mankind
14628,EPISTLE I.,Were not for their Monarch’s good Pleasure design’d.
14629,EPISTLE I.,We know and believe they’re as truly his own
14630,EPISTLE I.,"As the Farmer’s his Beast, or the wheat he has sown;"
14631,EPISTLE I.,And he’s a most stupid and scandalous Block
14632,EPISTLE I.,"Who would not be part of so noble a Stock,      70"
14633,EPISTLE I.,"To fetch and to carry, be curried and fed,"

14635,EPISTLE I.,"Ye Statesmen, I next to your Honours apply:"
14636,EPISTLE I.,Ye know the old Subject; ye ken who am I!
14637,EPISTLE I.,I would give each Advice how to act in his Station;
14638,EPISTLE I.,But most have without it entire Approbation.
14639,EPISTLE I.,"Nay, let us confess, and give Mortals their due,"
14640,EPISTLE I.,We borrow a great many Maxims from you!
14641,EPISTLE I.,"And would ne’er have you heed what your Satirists say,"
14642,EPISTLE I.,Who expose to the World all your pensions and pay.      80
14643,EPISTLE I.,"Such Wretches, by jealous Emotions betray’d,"
14644,EPISTLE I.,"Are as knavish as you, and yet never get paid."
14645,EPISTLE I.,"Sejanus politely his Compliments sends,"
14646,EPISTLE I.,"To show he remembers his very good Friends,"
14647,EPISTLE I.,"And tells you, with Grief which his Feelings betray,"
14648,EPISTLE I.,He hears ye are some of ye veering away.
14649,EPISTLE I.,"If this—and there’s Reason to fear it—be true,"
14650,EPISTLE I.,I’d have ye consider what end ye pursue;
14651,EPISTLE I.,"You’ll find you’ve a very bad bargain at last,"
14652,EPISTLE I.,Despis’d for the present and damn’d for the past.      90

14658,EPISTLE I.,"That it leads you directly, he need not say where."
14659,EPISTLE I.,"At a Crisis important to Europe and us,"
14660,EPISTLE I.,"It becomes us, my Friends, to act constantly thus:"
14661,EPISTLE I.,"To stick to our Cause with a strong perseverance,"
14662,EPISTLE I.,Else Nobody knows what may happen a year hence;      100
14663,EPISTLE I.,"For in Times of Disturbance ’tis frequently seen,"
14664,EPISTLE I.,That Virtue’s more busy than when they’re serene;
14665,EPISTLE I.,"And, from a good Spirit in brisk fermentation,"
14666,EPISTLE I.,A Clear-settled Habit may reign in each Nation;
14667,EPISTLE I.,The which to prevent ’tis my serious Command
14668,EPISTLE I.,You carefully lend each his Heart and his Hand.
14669,EPISTLE I.,"In England I’ve studied that People’s Condition,"
14670,EPISTLE I.,And seen the Contents of each County’s petition;
14671,EPISTLE I.,"By which I collect, with a Logic my own,"
14672,EPISTLE I.,The Seeds of Dissension are properly sown;      110
14673,EPISTLE I.,"And I’m not without Hope but, if suffer’d to grow,"
14674,EPISTLE I.,I may reap in due Time what I taught you to sow.
14675,EPISTLE I.,"But I’m sorry to find that, in spite of my Care"

14677,EPISTLE I.,"Whom though I’ve attended with studious Skill,"
14678,EPISTLE I.,I don’t know a people have us’d me so ill.
14679,EPISTLE I.,"Go, Wretches ingrate; see my Subjects in France,"
14680,EPISTLE I.,With what excellent skill they my Business advance!
14681,EPISTLE I.,"Do they stick to Agreements, or such Kind of Things?"
14682,EPISTLE I.,"Is there Truth in their Courtiers, or Faith in their Kings?"
14683,EPISTLE I.,"Their Notions of Honour, or keeping of Treaties,      121"
14684,EPISTLE I.,Are govern’d by that kind of Body their Fleet is;
14685,EPISTLE I.,While you of a Nation I take such Delight in
14686,EPISTLE I.,"Are inferior in Fraud, tho’ you beat them at fighting."
14687,EPISTLE I.,"Ye Spirits uncurb’d by the Dictates of Schools,"

14692,EPISTLE I.,Who know not the Depth of the Thing you’re about—      130
14693,EPISTLE I.,"But, I’m willing to own it, ’tis proper you should"
14694,EPISTLE I.,And Satan here thanks you: ye’ve done him much Good.
14695,EPISTLE I.,"Before ye began to reform Men’s Opinions,"

14698,EPISTLE I.,"I’ve a pretty good Footing, my Friends, in the Nation;      }"
14699,EPISTLE I.,And I’d have you go on with each learn’d Dissertation.      }
14700,EPISTLE I.,For our firmest Adherents we commonly call
14701,EPISTLE I.,The Man who believes there’s no Devil at all;
14702,EPISTLE I.,"And, as you so clearly convince your attendants      140"
14703,EPISTLE I.,"We’re nothing, and all our good Company send hence,"
14704,EPISTLE I.,"Your learned Opinion, I find as I read it,"
14705,EPISTLE I.,"Advances my Gain, whilst it shatters my Credit,"
14706,EPISTLE I.,"As Bankrupts who wilfully plunge into Shame,"

14708,EPISTLE I.,"For the learned, the wise, and the deep-sighted Few,"
14709,EPISTLE I.,I’ve an excellent Work which I’d have ye pursue!
14710,EPISTLE I.,"Your Genius may mend a dull Devil’s Designs,"
14711,EPISTLE I.,"May alter my Manner, and polish my Lines."
14712,EPISTLE I.,The Scheme is exalted! is quite in your walk;      150
14713,EPISTLE I.,And I care not in what kind of Language I talk.
14714,EPISTLE I.,"’Tis to prove to Mankind, to whom pleasures belong,"
14715,EPISTLE I.,"Your Moralists, too, as your Pastors, are wrong;"
14716,EPISTLE I.,That not to Religion alone is confin’d
14717,EPISTLE I.,"Our work, but a full Reformation’s design’d;"
14718,EPISTLE I.,"Till your Country all Kinds of Enjoyment excell in,"
14719,EPISTLE I.,And [become] much the Kind of a Place which we dwell in.
14720,EPISTLE I.,But first you’ll my Congratulations receive
14721,EPISTLE I.,"For the exquisite Pleasure your arguments give,"
14722,EPISTLE I.,Which we hear with a vast deal of Joy and Delight      160
14723,EPISTLE I.,"At Coachmakers’ Hall, almost every Night,"
14724,EPISTLE I.,And are so entertain’d with the things in that Style
14725,EPISTLE I.,That we’d thoughts of erecting our Houses-Carlisle.
14726,EPISTLE I.,But the Motion was quash’d on a due recollection—
14727,EPISTLE I.,Our good Subjects here ev’ry Party and Sect shun—
14728,EPISTLE I.,"That we have the same Constant Business in View,"
14729,EPISTLE I.,And can never dissent in opinion like you;
14730,EPISTLE I.,Nor suffer we here any Authors to write;
14731,EPISTLE I.,"And to talk of the State, why, ’tis deemed impolite;"
14732,EPISTLE I.,"And the Point Revelation, that’s banish’d your Creed,      170"
14733,EPISTLE I.,Would not move a Debate where we all are agreed;
14734,EPISTLE I.,Nor have we a Subject which Satan can reckon
14735,EPISTLE I.,Is fit for a Genius among us to speak on.
14736,EPISTLE I.,"But, by Way of Digression, we can but admire"
14737,EPISTLE I.,"That your Ladies to argue should cooly desire,"
14738,EPISTLE I.,Should one at a Time any Subject discuss:
14739,EPISTLE I.,They ne’er could be brought to that Order with us.
14740,EPISTLE I.,But they still altogether their Subjects pursue
14741,EPISTLE I.,With the Knack which they formerly had among you;
14742,EPISTLE I.,And we marvel that Men of Discretion can teach      180
14743,EPISTLE I.,To such Lips the all-conquering Graces of Speech!
14744,EPISTLE I.,"But my Plan to return to, ye Sages, assist;"
14745,EPISTLE I.,"Let’s our Heads lay together, our Arguments twist,"

14747,EPISTLE I.,"In our dearly beloved, our Toland and Tindal!"
14748,EPISTLE I.,"With Arguments all unresisted as these,"
14749,EPISTLE I.,That men have a right to do just what they please;

14751,EPISTLE I.,"My Actions, my Spirit, my Merit and Fame,"
14752,EPISTLE I.,With Modesty such as you can but approve      190
14753,EPISTLE I.,I shall speak in the Words of my Vot’ries above.
14754,EPISTLE I.,"Yet, again to digress: you must never suppose"
14755,EPISTLE I.,But even the learned are sometimes my Foes;
14756,EPISTLE I.,"Nor is it a volatile Genius alone,"
14757,EPISTLE I.,"Or eccentric Attempt, that proclaims you my own,"
14758,EPISTLE I.,"There was Priestley, they told me, had wrote in my Cause,"
14759,EPISTLE I.,And publish’d good Things with a deal of Applause;

14761,EPISTLE I.,"He scrawl in my Favour! No, damn him, not he!"

15469,BELVOIR CASTLE.,"When lo! another Castle rose in view,"
15470,BELVOIR CASTLE.,That in an instant all his pride o’erthrew.

15474,BELVOIR CASTLE.,Robb’d not the weightier parts of dignity;
15475,BELVOIR CASTLE.,"Nor what was ponderous hid the work of grace,"
15476,BELVOIR CASTLE.,"But all were just, and all in proper place."
15477,BELVOIR CASTLE.,"Terrace on terrace rose, and there was seen"

15495,BELVOIR CASTLE.,"The spirit view’d him with benignant grace,"

15507,BELVOIR CASTLE.,Some gentle spirit to my mind has brought
15508,BELVOIR CASTLE.,Forms of fair works to be hereafter wrought;      120

16014,FLIRTATION.,Would you to him present the naked mind?
16015,FLIRTATION.,"If it were clear as crystal, yet it checks"
16016,FLIRTATION.,One’s joy to think that he may fancy specks;
16017,FLIRTATION.,"And now, in five long years, we scarcely know"
16018,FLIRTATION.,"How the mind gets them, and how large they grow."
16019,FLIRTATION.,"Let woman be as rigid as a nun,"
16020,FLIRTATION.,She cannot censures and surmises shun.
16021,FLIRTATION.,"Wonder not, then, at tales that Scandal tells—"
16022,FLIRTATION.,Your father’s rooms were not like sisters’ cells;
16023,FLIRTATION.,"Nor pious monks came there, nor prosing friars,      30"
16024,FLIRTATION.,"But well-dress’d captains, and approving squires."
16025,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ What these to me, admit th’ account be true?"
16026,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Nay, that yourself describe—they came to you!"
16027,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ Well! to my friend I may the truth confess,"
16028,FLIRTATION.,Poor Captain Glimmer loved me to excess;
16029,FLIRTATION.,"Flintham, the young solicitor, that wrote"
16030,FLIRTATION.,"Those pretty verses, he began to dote;"
16031,FLIRTATION.,"That Youth from Oxford, when I used to stop"
16032,FLIRTATION.,"A moment with him, at my feet would drop;"
16033,FLIRTATION.,"Nor less your Brother, whom, for your dear sake,      40}"
16034,FLIRTATION.,I to my favour often used to take—      }
16035,FLIRTATION.,"And was, vile world! my character at stake?      }"
16036,FLIRTATION.,"If such reports my Sailor’s ear should reach,"
16037,FLIRTATION.,What jealous thoughts and fancies may they teach;
16038,FLIRTATION.,"If without cause ill-judging men suspect,"
16039,FLIRTATION.,What may not all these harmless Truths effect?
16040,FLIRTATION.,"And what, my Delia, if our virtues fail,"
16041,FLIRTATION.,What must we fear if conscious we are frail?
16042,FLIRTATION.,"And well you know, my friend, nor fear t’ impart,"
16043,FLIRTATION.,The tender frailties of the yielding heart.      50
16044,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Speak for yourself, fair lady! speak with care;"
16045,FLIRTATION.,"I not your frailties, but your suffering, share."
16046,FLIRTATION.,"You may my counsel, if you will, refuse;"
16047,FLIRTATION.,"But, pray, beware how you my name accuse!"
16048,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ Accuse you! No! there is no need of One,"
16049,FLIRTATION.,To do what long the public voice has done.
16050,FLIRTATION.,"What misses, then at school, forget the fall      }"
16051,FLIRTATION.,"Of Ensign Bloomer, when he leapt the wall?      }"
16052,FLIRTATION.,"That was a first exploit, and we were witness all;      }"
16053,FLIRTATION.,"And that sad night, upon my faithful breast,      60"
16054,FLIRTATION.,"We wept together, till we sank to rest."
16055,FLIRTATION.,You own’d your love——
16056,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ A girl, a chit, a child!"
16057,FLIRTATION.,"Am I for this, and by a friend, reviled?"
16058,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ Then lay your hand, fair creature! on your heart,"
16059,FLIRTATION.,And say how many there have had a part!
16060,FLIRTATION.,"Six I remember; and, if Fame be true,"
16061,FLIRTATION.,The handsome Serjeant had his portion too.
16062,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ A Serjeant! Madam, if I might advise,"
16063,FLIRTATION.,Do use some small discretion in such lies!
16064,FLIRTATION.,"A Serjeant, Celia?——"
16065,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ Handsome, smart, and clean.      70"
16066,FLIRTATION.,"Yes! and the fellow had a noble mien,"
16067,FLIRTATION.,"That might excuse you, had you giv’n your hand—"
16068,FLIRTATION.,But this your father could not understand.
16069,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Mercy! how pert and flippant are you grown,"
16070,FLIRTATION.,As if you’d not a secret of your own!
16071,FLIRTATION.,"Yet would you tremble, should your Sailor know"
16072,FLIRTATION.,"What I, or my small cabinet, could show:"
16073,FLIRTATION.,"He might suspect a heart with many a wound,"
16074,FLIRTATION.,"Shallow and deep, could never more be sound;"
16075,FLIRTATION.,"That of one pierced so oft, so largely bled,      80}"
16076,FLIRTATION.,"The feeling ceases, and the love is dead;      }"
16077,FLIRTATION.,"But sense exists, and passion serves instead.      }"
16078,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ Injurious Delia! cold, reproachful maid!"
16079,FLIRTATION.,Is thus my confidential faith repaid?
16080,FLIRTATION.,"Is this the counsel that we two have held,"
16081,FLIRTATION.,"When duty trembled, and desire rebell’d;"
16082,FLIRTATION.,"The sister-vows we made, through many a night,"
16083,FLIRTATION.,To aid each other in the arduous fight
16084,FLIRTATION.,With the harsh-minded powers who never think
16085,FLIRTATION.,"What nature needs, nor will at weakness wink?      90"
16086,FLIRTATION.,"And now, thou cruel girl! is all forgot,      }"
16087,FLIRTATION.,"The wish oft whisper’d, the imagined lot,      }"
16088,FLIRTATION.,"The secret Hymen, the sequester’d cot?      }"
16089,FLIRTATION.,"And will you thus our bond of friendship rend,"
16090,FLIRTATION.,And join the world in censure of your friend?
16091,FLIRTATION.,"Oh! ’tis not right! as all with scorn must see,"
16092,FLIRTATION.,Although the certain mischief falls on me.
16093,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Nay, never weep! but let this kiss restore"
16094,FLIRTATION.,And make our friendship perfect as before;
16095,FLIRTATION.,"Do not our wiser selves ourselves condemn,      100"
16096,FLIRTATION.,And yet we dearly love their faults and them?
16097,FLIRTATION.,So our reproofs to tender minds are shown:
16098,FLIRTATION.,We treat their wanderings as we treat our own;
16099,FLIRTATION.,"We are each other’s conscience, and we tell"
16100,FLIRTATION.,"Our friend her fault, because we wish her well;"
16101,FLIRTATION.,"We judge, nay prejudge, what may be her case,"
16102,FLIRTATION.,"Fore-arm the soul, and shield her from disgrace."
16103,FLIRTATION.,"Creatures in prison, ere the trying day,"
16104,FLIRTATION.,"Their answers practise, and their powers essay."
16105,FLIRTATION.,"By means like these they guard against surprise,      110"
16106,FLIRTATION.,And all the puzzling questions that may rise.
16107,FLIRTATION.,“Guilty or not?” His lawyer thus address’d
16108,FLIRTATION.,"A wealthy rogue—“Not guilty, I protest.”—"
16109,FLIRTATION.,"“Why, then, my friend, we’ve nothing here to say,"
16110,FLIRTATION.,But you’re in danger! prithee heed your way!
16111,FLIRTATION.,"_You_ know your truth, _I_ where your error lies:"
16112,FLIRTATION.,From your ‘_Not_ guilty’ will your danger rise.”—
16113,FLIRTATION.,"“Oh! but I _am_, and I have here the gain"
16114,FLIRTATION.,Of wicked craft”—“Then let it _here_ remain;
16115,FLIRTATION.,"For we must guard it by a sure defence,      120"
16116,FLIRTATION.,And not professions of your innocence;
16117,FLIRTATION.,"For that’s the way, whatever you suppose,"
16118,FLIRTATION.,To slip your neck within the ready noose.”
16119,FLIRTATION.,"Thus, my beloved friend, a girl, if wise,"
16120,FLIRTATION.,"Upon her Prudence, not her Truth, relies;"
16121,FLIRTATION.,"It is confess’d, that not the good and pure"
16122,FLIRTATION.,Are in this world of calumny secure—
16123,FLIRTATION.,And therefore never let a lass rely
16124,FLIRTATION.,Upon her goodness and her chastity!
16125,FLIRTATION.,Her very virtue makes her heedless: youth      130
16126,FLIRTATION.,"Reveals imprudent, nay injurious, truth;"
16127,FLIRTATION.,"Whereas, if conscious that she merit blame,"
16128,FLIRTATION.,"She grows discreet, and well defends her fame,"
16129,FLIRTATION.,"And thus, offending, better makes her way—"
16130,FLIRTATION.,As Joseph Surface argues in the play—
16131,FLIRTATION.,"Than when in virtue’s strength she proudly stood,"
16132,FLIRTATION.,"So wrongly right, and so absurdly good."
16133,FLIRTATION.,"Now, when your Charles shall be your judge, and try      }"
16134,FLIRTATION.,His own dear damsel—questioning how and why—      }
16135,FLIRTATION.,"Let her be ready, arm’d with prompt reply;      140}"
16136,FLIRTATION.,"No hesitation let the man discern,"
16137,FLIRTATION.,"But answer boldly, then accuse in turn:"
16138,FLIRTATION.,"Some trifling points with candid speech confess’d,"
16139,FLIRTATION.,You gain a monstrous credit for the rest.
16140,FLIRTATION.,"Then may you wear the Injured Lady frown,"
16141,FLIRTATION.,And with your anger keep his malice down;
16142,FLIRTATION.,"Accuse, condemn, and make him glad at heart"
16143,FLIRTATION.,"To sue for pardon, when you come to part."
16144,FLIRTATION.,"But let him have it; let him go in peace,"
16145,FLIRTATION.,And all inquiries of themselves will cease;      150
16146,FLIRTATION.,"To touch him nearer, and to hold him fast,"
16147,FLIRTATION.,Have a few tears _in petto_ at the last—
16148,FLIRTATION.,"But this with care! for ’tis a point of doubt,"
16149,FLIRTATION.,If you should end with weeping or without.
16150,FLIRTATION.,"’Tis true you much affect him by your pain,"
16151,FLIRTATION.,But he may want to prove his power again;
16152,FLIRTATION.,"And, then, it spoils the look, and hurts the eyes—"
16153,FLIRTATION.,A girl is never handsome when she cries.
16154,FLIRTATION.,"Take it for granted, in a general way,"
16155,FLIRTATION.,"The more you weep for men, the more you may.      160"
16156,FLIRTATION.,"Save your resources; for, though now you cry"
16157,FLIRTATION.,"With good effect, you may not by and by."
16158,FLIRTATION.,It is a knack; and there are those that weep
16159,FLIRTATION.,"Without emotion, that a man may sleep;"
16160,FLIRTATION.,"Others disgust—’tis genius, not advice,"
16161,FLIRTATION.,That will avail us in a thing so nice.
16162,FLIRTATION.,"If you should love him, you have greater need"
16163,FLIRTATION.,"Of all your care, and may not then succeed."
16164,FLIRTATION.,For that’s our bane—we should be conquerors all
16165,FLIRTATION.,With hearts untouch’d—our feelings cause our fall.      170
16166,FLIRTATION.,But your experience aids you: you can hide
16167,FLIRTATION.,Your real weakness in your borrow’d pride.
16168,FLIRTATION.,"But to the point—should so the Charge be laid,"
16169,FLIRTATION.,That nought against it fairly can be said—
16170,FLIRTATION.,How would you act? You would not then confess?—
16171,FLIRTATION.,_C._ Oh! never! no!—nor even my Truth profess!
16172,FLIRTATION.,To mute contempt I would alone resort
16173,FLIRTATION.,"For the Reporters, and for their Report."
16174,FLIRTATION.,"If he profess’d forgiveness, I would cry—"
16175,FLIRTATION.,“Forgive such faithlessness! so would not I!      180
16176,FLIRTATION.,Such errors pardon! he that so would act
16177,FLIRTATION.,"Would, I am sure, be guilty of the fact."
16178,FLIRTATION.,"Charles, if I thought your spirit was so mean,"
16179,FLIRTATION.,I would not longer in your walks be seen;
16180,FLIRTATION.,Could you such woman for a moment prize?
16181,FLIRTATION.,"You might forgive her, but you must despise.”"
16182,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Bravo, my girl! ’tis then our sex command,"
16183,FLIRTATION.,When we can seize the weapon in their hand;
16184,FLIRTATION.,"When we their charge so manage, that ’tis found"
16185,FLIRTATION.,To save the credit it was meant to wound.      190
16186,FLIRTATION.,"Those who by reasons their acquittal seek,"
16187,FLIRTATION.,Make the whole sex contemptible and weak;
16188,FLIRTATION.,"This, too, observe—that men of sense in love"
16189,FLIRTATION.,Dupes more complete than fools and blockheads prove;
16190,FLIRTATION.,"For all that knowledge lent them as a guide,"
16191,FLIRTATION.,Goes off entirely to the lady’s side;
16192,FLIRTATION.,"Whereas the blockhead rather sees the more,"
16193,FLIRTATION.,And gains perception that he lack’d before.
16194,FLIRTATION.,His honest passion blinds the man of sense.
16195,FLIRTATION.,While want of feeling is the fool’s defence;      200
16196,FLIRTATION.,Arm’d with insensibility he comes;
16197,FLIRTATION.,"When more repell’d, he but the more assumes,"
16198,FLIRTATION.,And thus succeeds where fails the man of wit;
16199,FLIRTATION.,"For, where we cannot conquer, we submit."
16200,FLIRTATION.,"But come, my love! let us examine now,      }"
16201,FLIRTATION.,"These Charges all—say, what shall we avow,      }"
16202,FLIRTATION.,"Admit, deny; and which defend, and how?      }"
16203,FLIRTATION.,"That old affair between your friend and you,"
16204,FLIRTATION.,"When your fond Sailor bade his home adieu,"
16205,FLIRTATION.,May be forgotten; yet we should prepare      210
16206,FLIRTATION.,For all events—and are you guarded there?
16207,FLIRTATION.,_C._ Oh! ’tis long since—I might the whole deny—
16208,FLIRTATION.,"“So poor, and so contemptible a lie!"
16209,FLIRTATION.,"Charles, if ’tis pleasant to abuse your friend,"
16210,FLIRTATION.,Let there be something that she may defend;
16211,FLIRTATION.,This is too silly—”
16212,FLIRTATION.,_D._ Well you may appear
16213,FLIRTATION.,With so much spirit—not a witness near;
16214,FLIRTATION.,"Time puzzles judgment; and, when none explain,"
16215,FLIRTATION.,You may assume the airs of high disdain.
16216,FLIRTATION.,"But, for my Brother—night and morn were you      220"
16217,FLIRTATION.,"Together found, th’ inseparable two,"
16218,FLIRTATION.,Far from the haunts of vulgar prying men—
16219,FLIRTATION.,In the old abbey—in the lonely glen—
16220,FLIRTATION.,In the beech-wood—within the quarry made
16221,FLIRTATION.,"By hands long dead—within the silent glade,"
16222,FLIRTATION.,Where the moon gleams upon the spring that flows
16223,FLIRTATION.,By the grey willows as they stand in rows—
16224,FLIRTATION.,Shall I proceed? there’s not a quiet spot
16225,FLIRTATION.,In all the parish where the pair were not
16226,FLIRTATION.,"Oft watch’d, oft seen. You must not so despise      230"
16227,FLIRTATION.,"This weighty charge—Now, what will you devise?"
16228,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ “Her brother! What, Sir? jealous of a child!"
16229,FLIRTATION.,"A friend’s relation! Why, the man is wild—"
16230,FLIRTATION.,"A boy not yet at college! Come, this proves"
16231,FLIRTATION.,Some truth in you! This is a freak of Love’s:
16232,FLIRTATION.,"I must forgive it, though I know not how"
16233,FLIRTATION.,A thing so very simple to allow.
16234,FLIRTATION.,"Pray, if I meet my cousin’s little boy,"
16235,FLIRTATION.,"And take a kiss, would that your peace annoy?"
16236,FLIRTATION.,"But I remember Delia—yet, to give      240"
16237,FLIRTATION.,"A thought to this is folly, as I live—"
16238,FLIRTATION.,But I remember Delia made her prayer
16239,FLIRTATION.,That I would try and give the Boy an air;
16240,FLIRTATION.,"Yet awkward he, for all the pains we took—"
16241,FLIRTATION.,"A bookish boy, his pleasure is his book;"
16242,FLIRTATION.,"And since the lad is grown to man’s estate,"
16243,FLIRTATION.,We never speak—Your bookish youth I hate.”
16244,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Right! and he cannot tell, with all his art,"
16245,FLIRTATION.,Our father’s will compelled you both to part.
16246,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ Nay, this is needless—"
16247,FLIRTATION.,"_D._ Oh! when you are tried, 250"
16248,FLIRTATION.,"And taught for trial, must I feed your pride?"
16249,FLIRTATION.,Oh! that’s the vice of which I still complain:
16250,FLIRTATION.,Men could not triumph were not women vain.
16251,FLIRTATION.,But now proceed—say _boyhood_ in this case
16252,FLIRTATION.,(The last obscure one) shields you from disgrace.
16253,FLIRTATION.,"But what of Shelley? all your foes can prove,"
16254,FLIRTATION.,"And all your friends, that here indeed was love."
16255,FLIRTATION.,"For three long months you met as lovers meet,"
16256,FLIRTATION.,And half the town has seen him at your feet;
16257,FLIRTATION.,"Then, on the evil day that saw you part,      260"
16258,FLIRTATION.,Your ashy looks betray’d your aching heart.
16259,FLIRTATION.,With this against you——
16260,FLIRTATION.,"_C._ This, my watchful friend,"
16261,FLIRTATION.,"Confess I cannot, therefore must defend."
16262,FLIRTATION.,"“Shelley! dear Charles, how enter’d he your mind?"
16263,FLIRTATION.,Well may they say that jealousy is blind!
16264,FLIRTATION.,"Of all the men who talk’d with me of love,"
16265,FLIRTATION.,His were the offers I could least approve;
16266,FLIRTATION.,"My father’s choice—and, Charles, you must agree      }"
16267,FLIRTATION.,That my good father seldom thinks with me—      }
16268,FLIRTATION.,"Or his had been the grief, while thou wert tost at sea!      }"
16269,FLIRTATION.,"It was so odious—when that man was near,      271"
16270,FLIRTATION.,My father never could himself appear;
16271,FLIRTATION.,"Had I received his fav’rite with a frown,"
16272,FLIRTATION.,Upon my word he would have knock’d me down.”
16273,FLIRTATION.,_D._ Well! grant you durst not frown—but people say
16274,FLIRTATION.,That you were dying when he went away.
16275,FLIRTATION.,Yes! you were ill! of that no doubts remain;
16276,FLIRTATION.,And how explain it?—
16277,FLIRTATION.,_C._ Oh! I’ll soon explain.
16278,FLIRTATION.,"“I sicken’d, say you, when the man was gone—"
16279,FLIRTATION.,"Could I be well, if sickness would come on?      280"
16280,FLIRTATION.,Fact follows fact; but is ‘t of Nature’s laws
16281,FLIRTATION.,That one of course must be the other’s cause?
16282,FLIRTATION.,"Just as her husband tried his fav’rite gun,"
16283,FLIRTATION.,My cousin brought him forth his first-born son—
16284,FLIRTATION.,"The birth might either flash or fright succeed,"
16285,FLIRTATION.,"But neither, sure, were causes of the deed."
16286,FLIRTATION.,"That Shelley left us, it is very true—"
16287,FLIRTATION.,"That sickness found me, I confess it too;"
16288,FLIRTATION.,"But that the one was cause, and one effect,"
16289,FLIRTATION.,Is a conceit I utterly reject.      290
16290,FLIRTATION.,"You may, my Friend, demonstrate, if you please,"
16291,FLIRTATION.,That disappointment will bring on disease;
16292,FLIRTATION.,"But, if it should, I would be glad to know"
16293,FLIRTATION.,If ’tis a quinsy that such griefs bestow?
16294,FLIRTATION.,"A heart may suffer, if a lady doat;"
16295,FLIRTATION.,But will she feel her anguish in the throat?
16296,FLIRTATION.,"I’ve heard of pangs that tender folks endure,"
16297,FLIRTATION.,But not that linctuses and blisters cure.”—
16298,FLIRTATION.,"Your thoughts, my Delia?"
16299,FLIRTATION.,_D._ What I think of this?
16300,FLIRTATION.,"Why! if he smile, it is not much amiss.      300"
16301,FLIRTATION.,"But there are humours; and, by them possess’d,"
16302,FLIRTATION.,A lover will not hearken to a jest.
16303,FLIRTATION.,"Well, let this pass!—but, for the next affair,"
16304,FLIRTATION.,We know your father was indignant there:
16305,FLIRTATION.,He hated Miller. Say! if Charles should press
16306,FLIRTATION.,"For explanation, what would you confess?"
16307,FLIRTATION.,You cannot there on his commands presume;
16308,FLIRTATION.,"Besides, you fainted in a public room;"
16309,FLIRTATION.,"There own’d your flame, and, like heroic maid,"
16310,FLIRTATION.,The sovereign impulse of your will obey’d.      310
16311,FLIRTATION.,"What, to your thinking, was the world’s disdain?"
16312,FLIRTATION.,You could retort its insolence again.
16313,FLIRTATION.,"Your boundless passion boldly you avow’d,"
16314,FLIRTATION.,And spoke the purpose of your soul aloud;
16315,FLIRTATION.,"Associates, servants, friends, alike can prove"
16316,FLIRTATION.,The world-defying force of Celia’s love.
16317,FLIRTATION.,"Did she not wish, nay vow, to poison her"
16318,FLIRTATION.,"Whom, some durst whisper, Damon could prefer?"
16319,FLIRTATION.,And then that frantic quarrel at the ball—
16320,FLIRTATION.,"It must be known, and he will hear it all.      320"
16321,FLIRTATION.,"Nay! never frown, but cast about, in time,"
16322,FLIRTATION.,How best to answer what he thinks a crime;
16323,FLIRTATION.,"For what he thinks might have but little weight,"
16324,FLIRTATION.,If you could answer—
16325,FLIRTATION.,_C._ Then I’ll answer straight—
16326,FLIRTATION.,Not without Truth; for who would vainly tell
16327,FLIRTATION.,"A wretched lie, when Truth might serve as well?"
16328,FLIRTATION.,Had I not Fever? is not that the bane
16329,FLIRTATION.,Of human wisdom? was I not insane?
16330,FLIRTATION.,"“Oh! Charles, no more! would you recall the day"
16331,FLIRTATION.,When it pleased Fate to take my wits away?      330
16332,FLIRTATION.,How can I answer for a thousand things
16333,FLIRTATION.,That this disorder to the sufferer brings?
16334,FLIRTATION.,"Is it not known, the men whom you dislike"
16335,FLIRTATION.,Are those who now the erring fancy strike?
16336,FLIRTATION.,"Nor would it much surprise me, if ’twere true,"
16337,FLIRTATION.,That in those days of dread I slighted you.

17048,TRACY.,
17049,TRACY.,(1 Jan. 1813.)
17050,TRACY.,
17051,TRACY.,The House of Tracy was of all belov’d:
17052,TRACY.,"A generous, gentle, valiant, virtuous Race,"
17053,TRACY.,"Admir’d for Courage and for Arts approv’d,"
17054,TRACY.,They shun’d Dishonour and they spurn’d Disgrace.
17055,TRACY.,"The Village Mansion was a noble Place,"
17056,TRACY.,Whose strong Foundations down a Vale were laid;
17057,TRACY.,"Pride of its Lords and of the Country Grace,"
17058,TRACY.,"Its Towers were o’er the western hill display’d,"
17059,TRACY.,And on an Eastern Stream broad cast their Evening Shade.
17060,TRACY.,
17061,TRACY.,"Twice twenty Steps of Stone, now mossy all,      10"
17062,TRACY.,Led wandering Strangers to the central Door
17063,TRACY.,"Of a vast Room, by name the marble Hall,"
17064,TRACY.,Whose squares discolour’d form’d the polish’d floor.
17065,TRACY.,Broad were the Stairs and black that rose before
17066,TRACY.,And led to Chambers fair and Galleries wide;
17067,TRACY.,"Here Tracys stood, Men fam’d in days of yore;"
17068,TRACY.,"These Pictures rare, by Taste and Wealth, supply’d"
17069,TRACY.,"The Pride of Tracy these, and worthy praise the pride."
17070,TRACY.,
17071,TRACY.,Th’ Improver’s Hand was seen in all the place;
17072,TRACY.,"But Mercy still was a Companion found,      20"
17073,TRACY.,"And spar’d the Statues fair, the Wood to grace,"
17074,TRACY.,And Waters clear that fell with murmuring sound
17075,TRACY.,"From the green Terrace on the higher Ground,"
17076,TRACY.,"With Flowers in Knolls on many a sunny Bank,"
17077,TRACY.,Where the white flocks o’er velvet Pasture bound;
17078,TRACY.,"Where Gold-fish long possess’d their marble Tank,"
17079,TRACY.,And steeds with silky Sides the living Water drank.
17080,TRACY.,
17081,TRACY.,"It was a lovely and a rich domain,"
17082,TRACY.,"Vex’d by no Debt, no Mortgage, no Decrease;"
17083,TRACY.,No Tenant came with unredress’d Complaint      30
17084,TRACY.,Of Churlish Steward or of rigorous Lease;
17085,TRACY.,"In the fair Village dwelt perpetual Peace,"
17086,TRACY.,"Far as a Patron could his power extend,"
17087,TRACY.,Hail’d at his birth and mourn’d at his discease;
17088,TRACY.,"Where all, where each, was pleas’d his help to lend"
17089,TRACY.,"To each, where all might seeking find a friend."
17090,TRACY.,
17091,TRACY.,"Two furlongs distant from that seat, its Pride,"
17092,TRACY.,"Was the fair Village plac’d upon a Green,"
17093,TRACY.,"By wood surrounded save the Eastern Side,"
17094,TRACY.,"Where the broad, silent, silvery flood was seen.      40"
17095,TRACY.,"There stood the peasants’ cots, a view serene"
17096,TRACY.,"On either side a small and central Lake,"
17097,TRACY.,That long the scene of rustic Sports had been.
17098,TRACY.,Unenvied People! may ye still partake
17099,TRACY.,"Life’s honest Joys and pure, and late may ye forsake!"
17100,TRACY.,
17101,TRACY.,The whiten’d Church and Vicar’s low Abode
17102,TRACY.,Are near each other and these Dwellings near;
17103,TRACY.,"But, far from Town and from the public Road,"
17104,TRACY.,"Few Travellers stray, few Strangers travel here;"
17105,TRACY.,"Where yet an Inn, “The Tracy’s Arms,” appear,      50"
17106,TRACY.,"The Mill, the Shop, and Trades that Peasants need,"
17107,TRACY.,But Farmers all; the Soil to all so dear
17108,TRACY.,Gives to the Peasant’s Cow a space to feed;
17109,TRACY.,"Such was the Tracys’ will, and Heav’n approves the Deed."
17110,TRACY.,
17111,TRACY.,"A numerous Race were these, and Sons were lent"
17112,TRACY.,To England’s Honour and were great in Arms;
17113,TRACY.,But now the generous Blood seems nearly spent.
17114,TRACY.,One Son one only Son had raised Alarms
17115,TRACY.,For Generations three! nor female Charms
17116,TRACY.,As heretofore had done their Parents Grace;      60
17117,TRACY.,"These Lords had dwelt amid their flocks and farms,"
17118,TRACY.,"A mild benevolent and virtuous Race,"
17119,TRACY.,Whose Lives accorded well with this their favourite Place.
17120,TRACY.,
17121,TRACY.,"Sir Edward Tracy was a valiant Man,"
17122,TRACY.,Who served in Flanders under Good Queen Anne;
17123,TRACY.,"Was wounded there, and in his pleasant seat"
17124,TRACY.,Found a fair Dame that made Retirement sweet.
17125,TRACY.,"There he enjoy’d a life of social Ease,"
17126,TRACY.,And died before its vital Spirits freeze.
17127,TRACY.,"He left a pensive, mild, domestic heir,      70"
17128,TRACY.,Pleas’d to improve his Mansion and repair;
17129,TRACY.,"The small Improvements in his farms to make,"
17130,TRACY.,And rustic bliss to foster and partake.
17131,TRACY.,"He was a man who never in his Life,"
17132,TRACY.,"For Joy or Business, left his charming wife;"
17133,TRACY.,"To all her failings, if she had them, blind,"
17134,TRACY.,"He saw her faultless, and he felt her kind."
17135,TRACY.,"With undirected, unaspiring Views,"
17136,TRACY.,"He scorn’d Oppression, but he took his Dues;"
17137,TRACY.,"For rural Works he shew’d some trifling Skill,      80}"
17138,TRACY.,And little prone to either Good or ill.      }
17139,TRACY.,"His Heart was kind, but cool; his Passions right, but still.      }"
17140,TRACY.,"He, with a feeble spark of Glory warm’d,"
17141,TRACY.,Wish’d his sole Boy to be with Study charm’d;
17142,TRACY.,"Wish’d him that Honour he had fail’d to gain,"
17143,TRACY.,And hail’d the Labour that was not in vain.
17144,TRACY.,"He liv’d, the Honour of his spotless Line,"
17145,TRACY.,Fram’d in the Senate and the Bar to shine;
17146,TRACY.,"But, unambitious at an early Age,"
17147,TRACY.,He buried all the Patriot in the Sage;      90
17148,TRACY.,"And with his Lady, by her worth endear’d,"
17149,TRACY.,"Read what was spoken when he, once, was heard."
17150,TRACY.,"She, form’d in Courts to shine, was pleas’d to shun"
17151,TRACY.,"A thousand Lovers, to be blest with one;"
17152,TRACY.,And bade adieu without a single Sigh
17153,TRACY.,To Passion’s Language and to Flattery’s Eye.
17154,TRACY.,"He, like his Fathers, left an only Boy,"
17155,TRACY.,Ere dawning Reason spurn’d the childish Toy;
17156,TRACY.,"Pleas’d to reflect [the] Mother’s years were few,"
17157,TRACY.,"Her Temper perfect, and her Judgment true;      100"
17158,TRACY.,"That she would train him, good herself and wise,"
17159,TRACY.,All that was base and wicked to despise;
17160,TRACY.,"The Strength of Rebell Passions to defeat,      }"
17161,TRACY.,"Life’s Cares and Sorrows with firm Soul to meet,      }"
17162,TRACY.,And from the Flatterer’s Voice indignant to retreat.      }
17163,TRACY.,"She train’d him thus, and early was he known"
17164,TRACY.,To seek her pleasure and disguise his own;
17165,TRACY.,"Yet, if her fondness could a failing spy,"
17166,TRACY.,His youthful Spirits were too strong and high.
17167,TRACY.,"She found, or fear’d, intemperate Love of Joy      110"
17168,TRACY.,And would correct what else might Time destroy.
17169,TRACY.,"Yet hard the Task, to Mothers doubly hard,"
17170,TRACY.,O’er the light Heart to keep incessant Guard;
17171,TRACY.,"Still she against his buoyant Spirit strove,"
17172,TRACY.,"Who smil’d at Duty, but bow’d down to Love."
17173,TRACY.,"This is our Hero, a fond Widow’s Son,"
17174,TRACY.,"Rich, of high spirits, and just twenty-one;"
17175,TRACY.,"Yet [most] for Learning fam’d, and, tho’ untried,"
17176,TRACY.,His native Courage not a Soul denied.
17177,TRACY.,"For, tho’ the Tracys were so well belov’d,      120"
17178,TRACY.,Their real Courage was but seldom prov’d;
17179,TRACY.,Yet never Tracy was by Honour call’d
17180,TRACY.,Who fled the Summons or who look’d appall’d.
17181,TRACY.,"The timid parent, when the Son would cry"
17182,TRACY.,"“To breathe is Joy, to live is Extacy;"
17183,TRACY.,"To feel this pleasure ever strong and new,"
17184,TRACY.,And wish that every being felt it too”—
17185,TRACY.,"“Beware, my Tracy! let these Spirits sleep"
17186,TRACY.,And for the days of certain sorrow keep!
17187,TRACY.,"Kind [are] thy wishes, but are all in vain:      130"
17188,TRACY.,"There will be Griefs, Sighs, Sufferings and pain!"
17189,TRACY.,Waste not the strength that [a] Kind Heaven affords
17190,TRACY.,In a vain flourish of Exulting Words;
17191,TRACY.,But train thyself for the uncertain task—
17192,TRACY.,I ask it fondly and ’tis all I ask!”—
17193,TRACY.,"“Friend of my Soul,” replied the youth, “suppress"
17194,TRACY.,These fearful Precepts and their fond Distress!
17195,TRACY.,"If Time indeed must all my Joys expell,"
17196,TRACY.,"Oh, let me feel them when at ease and well!"
17197,TRACY.,I war with Care; it is my wish to go      140
17198,TRACY.,Where he resides and treat him as a foe.
17199,TRACY.,"When in the Cot the ugly fiend I trace,"
17200,TRACY.,I ask his business in that favour’d place;
17201,TRACY.,A Golden Shield I cast before his Eyes
17202,TRACY.,And never leave him till away he flies.
17203,TRACY.,"Tho’ stubborn oft, his utmost Wrath I dare"
17204,TRACY.,"And sing exulting, Now begone, old Care!"
17205,TRACY.,"This Villain Care had pinch’d a modest Cheek,"
17206,TRACY.,And so opprest her that she fear’d to speak.
17207,TRACY.,"Her Lover’s father, of her Charms afraid,      150"
17208,TRACY.,Forc’d [her] fond Lover from the pining Maid.
17209,TRACY.,"Poor Ellen’s Mother shar’d her Daughter’s Pain,"
17210,TRACY.,And her best offer met the Earl’s disdain.
17211,TRACY.,"Grief held them all, when like an Hero true"
17212,TRACY.,I freed the Captives and the Giant slew;
17213,TRACY.,Held a fair Prospect in the father’s Eye
17214,TRACY.,And saw resistance in an instant die.
17215,TRACY.,"Oh, take my Horses, and my Hounds dismiss,"
17216,TRACY.,But [give] Thy Tracy such delight as this!
17217,TRACY.,*      *      *      *      War      160
17218,TRACY.,With grief and wish him from thy bosom far!
17219,TRACY.,"I for this cause      *      *     * strive,"
17220,TRACY.,And am content to seem but half alive;
17221,TRACY.,Yet can I never from myself conceal
17222,TRACY.,That giving Pleasure is the way to feel.
17223,TRACY.,"“Can I be sad, when I behold her mine,"
17224,TRACY.,A beauteous maiden with a Soul divine?
17225,TRACY.,"Did ever beauty meet the wond’ring Eye,"
17226,TRACY.,Perfect as that which shines in Emely?
17227,TRACY.,Does not her Father to our Love consent?      170
17228,TRACY.,"Then what [can] damp our joys, or what prevent?"
17229,TRACY.,"And is she not belov’d, esteem’d of thee?"
17230,TRACY.,"Oh I am happy,—happy let me be!"
17231,TRACY.,"“Want I a kindred mind, my Julian? Shame"
17232,TRACY.,Be to the Man who gave th’ Apostate’s Name
17233,TRACY.,"To one whose Virtues all who know must Prize,"
17234,TRACY.,And who from Truth will ne’er apostatize!
17235,TRACY.,"Guide of my Life, Companion of my Youth,"
17236,TRACY.,Thy modest Manners and thy love of Truth
17237,TRACY.,"Cheer, aid and sooth me in my earthly race;      180"
17238,TRACY.,And Want of Joy would [thus] be Want of Grace.”—
17239,TRACY.,"“All, all are thine,” the gentle Lady cried;"
17240,TRACY.,"“Wealth, Health and Friends has bounteous Heaven supply’d;"
17241,TRACY.,The happiest Spirits and the loveliest Maid
17242,TRACY.,That ever smil’d; and yet am I afraid.
17243,TRACY.,"For Friends have fallen off, and Love grown cold,"
17244,TRACY.,And failing Health sigh’d over useless Gold;
17245,TRACY.,"While the strong Spirits, once to Error led,"
17246,TRACY.,Have flam’d to Madness or in Anguish fled.
17247,TRACY.,"Nay, look not thus; against myself I plead;      190"
17248,TRACY.,"Bid thee be grave, and yet would not succeed."
17249,TRACY.,"No, let me think my Tracy, when away—"
17250,TRACY.,For thou must go—still innocent and Gay.
17251,TRACY.,Short is the Time; yet for a Month to part
17252,TRACY.,Shakes the faint Courage of a Mother’s Heart;
17253,TRACY.,But to her aid thy Emely will come
17254,TRACY.,And think thee happy while she prays thee home.
17255,TRACY.,"Our distant friends this Sacrifice demand,"
17256,TRACY.,E’er the lov’d Maid bestows her promis’d Hand.
17257,TRACY.,"Court the good Dean! nor be with Ease denied,      200"
17258,TRACY.,To come and bless thee with thy matchless Bride!
17259,TRACY.,"Invite each friend to view thy happy Choice,"
17260,TRACY.,"Nor doubt the favouring Eye, th’approving Voice;"
17261,TRACY.,"For not an Ear will hear, and not an Eye"
17262,TRACY.,Will see a Charmer like our Emely!
17263,TRACY.,But tak’st thou Julian?”
17264,TRACY.,“Can I leave behind
17265,TRACY.,The only Comfort I can hope to find.
17266,TRACY.,"Friends thou wilt see; yet them I may mistake,"
17267,TRACY.,And I am certain of the Friend I take.”
17268,TRACY.,"“Yet this, my Son, and I will cease to plead:      210"
17269,TRACY.,’Tis not in Youth the secret Soul to read;
17270,TRACY.,’Tis not in Age! for who can hope to scan
17271,TRACY.,"Man’s latent Thoughts, oft hidden from the Man?"
17272,TRACY.,’Tis surely dangerous for the best below
17273,TRACY.,A Brother’s Secrets like his own to know;
17274,TRACY.,"Thy failings, follies, weakness, all to learn"
17275,TRACY.,And half form’d wishes in their birth discern.
17276,TRACY.,[Loves] not thy friend—ah! let me judge him wrong—
17277,TRACY.,O’er Wine to sit—nay why that look?—too long?
17278,TRACY.,"Have I not seen the bright’ning Eye, the Cheek      220"
17279,TRACY.,"With pleasure fever’d, paint the Judgment weak;"
17280,TRACY.,"And hast not thou, all joyful as thou art,"
17281,TRACY.,Yet pour’d new spirit on the [bounding] Heart;
17282,TRACY.,"And art thou, Tracy—I will add no more—"
17283,TRACY.,"Alone, in thought, as happy as before?"
17284,TRACY.,"Is all within so pure, so gay, so bright"
17285,TRACY.,"In thine own feelings and thy Maker’s Sight,"

17626,TRACY.,"But this was error; she disdain’d to cheat,"
17627,TRACY.,When she could lawfully and fairly beat;
17628,TRACY.,"Beside, she felt a Scruple to the Deed,"
17629,TRACY.,Except in Times of the extremest Need.
17630,TRACY.,"Rebells she scorn’d, and wish’d, with all her Soul,"
17631,TRACY.,"That Ropes might choak whom Laws could not controul,"
17632,TRACY.,And a Staunch Patriot was to her a word
17633,TRACY.,"For factious wretches, impious and absurd."
17634,TRACY.,Yet to the Cause she lov’d with so much Zeal      550
17635,TRACY.,"She could no more than Approbation deal,"
17636,TRACY.,And had her Schemes to lessen or evade
17637,TRACY.,The fairest Tax that could on Man be laid;
17638,TRACY.,Thinking that one so loyal should requite
17639,TRACY.,Her Self for shewing what was just and right.
17640,TRACY.,"She kept her Church, and often would exclaim"
17641,TRACY.,"To her unwilling Partner, “What a Shame!"
17642,TRACY.,"Is it so much, a quiet hour to pass"
17643,TRACY.,And give Example to the lower Class!”
17644,TRACY.,"She heard of Battles, where ten thousand fell,      560"
17645,TRACY.,And beg’d that none would on the Subject dwell:
17646,TRACY.,"“Such Wounds and Carnage, fire, blood, and Smoke!"
17647,TRACY.,Good God! it poison’d every Meal she took!”
17648,TRACY.,"Active and able to contend, she still      }"
17649,TRACY.,Found in her Lord a Stubbornness of Will;      }
17650,TRACY.,"A dull resisting Strength, that baffled all her Skill;      }"
17651,TRACY.,"A _Vis inertiæ_—and, in fact, no stone"
17652,TRACY.,Could be more stubborn to be wrought upon—
17653,TRACY.,"A Mind at rest, that she could neither please      }"
17654,TRACY.,"By any Effort, nor by any teize;      570}"
17655,TRACY.,A Soul envelop’d deep in intellectual Ease—      }
17656,TRACY.,"But this not always; favourite points to gain,"
17657,TRACY.,He would a Warfare valiantly maintain;
17658,TRACY.,"And then her Prudence taught the Dame to yield,"
17659,TRACY.,That she with double strength might take the field;
17660,TRACY.,"And, when victorious in some grand affair,"
17661,TRACY.,She [yielded] others as beneath her Care.
17662,TRACY.,The first-born Child had every dawning Grace
17663,TRACY.,And promis’d Beauty in her form and face.
17664,TRACY.,"“We’ll call her Julie, if you please, my dear,”      580"
17665,TRACY.,"The Mother cry’d, “I doat on Julie Vere.”—"
17666,TRACY.,“What! no Remembrance of her Aunt! for shame!
17667,TRACY.,You doat indeed! be Barbara her name!”—
17668,TRACY.,"“Oh! never, never”—and a storm began"
17669,TRACY.,That quite o’erpower’d the Spirit of the Man.
17670,TRACY.,"The Babe was Julie, nor a Word was heard"
17671,TRACY.,That spoke his Wishes to have interfer’d.
17672,TRACY.,Succeeding Daughters came with feeble Cry
17673,TRACY.,"Who caus’d few Cares, and only liv’d to die;"
17674,TRACY.,"But ten years past, when, to the Father’s Joy      590"
17675,TRACY.,"And Mother’s Glory, she produc’d a Boy."
17676,TRACY.,"Now said the Lady, “If you would consent"
17677,TRACY.,"To call him Frederick, I should be content.”"
17678,TRACY.,"“Be [sure],” he answer’d with a Sneer, “my Love,"
17679,TRACY.,I’ll give the Boy a Name you must approve:
17680,TRACY.,He shall be Julian!” “An heroic Name
17681,TRACY.,Of some old fool!” said the indignant Dame.
17682,TRACY.,"“Fool!” said the Husband; “nay, a glorious Prince;"
17683,TRACY.,Nor have Mankind beheld his equal since.
17684,TRACY.,"He the whole World from Superstition free’d,      600"
17685,TRACY.,A[nd] left the Bigots neither Cross nor Creed.”
17686,TRACY.,"“Well,” said the Wife, with infinite Disdain,"
17687,TRACY.,“Could not the Bigots get a Creed again?
17688,TRACY.,And ’tis your Maxim that all Crimes are bred
17689,TRACY.,By Men with new Opinions in their Head;
17690,TRACY.,Was it not foolish in your Prince to force
17691,TRACY.,These quiet Bigots from their antient Course?”—
17692,TRACY.,"“Nay, you mistake; he wanted to restore"
17693,TRACY.,Things as they had been in the Times of yore.”
17694,TRACY.,“What!” quoth the Lady; “both a foe and friend      610
17695,TRACY.,To Superstition! this can you defend?
17696,TRACY.,"I knew him not; but I suppose, if known,"
17697,TRACY.,He wish’d his people’s folly like his own;
17698,TRACY.,"He whom he could of his Religion made,"
17699,TRACY.,And punish’d those whom he could not persuade.—
17700,TRACY.,But let your favourite Prince his name afford;
17701,TRACY.,I will not quarrel with you for a Word.”
17702,TRACY.,"The Name she thought would not ungraceful be,"
17703,TRACY.,And nothing knew of the Apostacy.
17704,TRACY.,"The Priest objected, but the Squire maintain’d      620"
17705,TRACY.,"The Point with Vigor, and his purpose gain’d."
17706,TRACY.,"Thus liv’d the Couple, daily to contend,"
17707,TRACY.,And never wish’d their Quarrels at an End.
17708,TRACY.,"They felt no fondness, and no more of hate"
17709,TRACY.,Than gave an Edge and pleasure to debate.
17710,TRACY.,Contentions sprang from themes of every kind
17711,TRACY.,And wak’d from Sloth to Energy the Mind;
17712,TRACY.,"Quarrels they took, like Bitters, to excite"
17713,TRACY.,And give Exertion to the Appetite.
17714,TRACY.,For twice ten years the sprightly Course they try’d;      630
17715,TRACY.,"When the Strife ended, and the Husband died."
17716,TRACY.,But first he thought that she who had been long
17717,TRACY.,A Plague to him would lead his Julian wrong;
17718,TRACY.,Nor would she fail to soothe and to decoy
17719,TRACY.,To her own Will th’affection of the boy.
17720,TRACY.,Therefore a Friend and Neighbour he besought
17721,TRACY.,That no such Evil on the Child be wrought;
17722,TRACY.,"And, tho’ the friend was Christian, all was well."
17723,TRACY.,This rather pleas’d the dying Infidel;
17724,TRACY.,"For he confess’d he had among them seen,      640"
17725,TRACY.,"As spake their Actions, some with Conscience clean;"
17726,TRACY.,And not Philosophers themselves were found
17727,TRACY.,Above all seeming and within all sound.
17728,TRACY.,"Julian was thus in purest knowledge train’d,"
17729,TRACY.,In all the Father slighted or disdain’d:
17730,TRACY.,Honour to value at the noblest price;
17731,TRACY.,To hold no parly with a pleading Vice;
17732,TRACY.,And true Religion to defend in Times
17733,TRACY.,When Truth and faith were heresies and Crimes.
17734,TRACY.,The Man whom Vere judg’d fittest to protect      650
17735,TRACY.,"His Boy, when young, and into Life direct"
17736,TRACY.,Was one who made of Talents no display:      }
17737,TRACY.,"A mild good Man, of whom his friends could say      }"
17738,TRACY.,That Foes in vain might blame the Lord of Etheringay—      }
17739,TRACY.,"The “virtuous Boyle,” a Name that he sustain’d,"
17740,TRACY.,And well preserv’d the fame that others gain’d.
17741,TRACY.,He with a widow’d Father past his Time
17742,TRACY.,In aiding Merit and suppressing Crime;
17743,TRACY.,Nor till his fortieth year had found the fair
17744,TRACY.,"For whom he sigh’d, and sigh’d not in Despair.      660"
17745,TRACY.,Happy with her he seem’d as Man could be—
17746,TRACY.,Still happier with the Infant Emely.
17747,TRACY.,"In her fifth year, she saw with childish Joy,"
17748,TRACY.,"Then in his tenth, her Sire’s adopted boy."
17749,TRACY.,"Tall, handsome, unabash’d, in Spirit gay"
17750,TRACY.,She found a friend in study and in play.
17751,TRACY.,But brief the happy Season; Summons stern
17752,TRACY.,"Call’d Julian hence in other place to learn,"
17753,TRACY.,"For other Studies of severer kind,"
17754,TRACY.,And by harsh Contest form the manly Mind.      670
17755,TRACY.,"But, in the time when youthful bosoms beat"
17756,TRACY.,"Twice in each year for the paternal Seat,"
17757,TRACY.,"A few Dull Days he with his Mother past,"
17758,TRACY.,But gave to Emely the best and last.
17759,TRACY.,"Young as he was, he found himself too old"
17760,TRACY.,This youthful beauty coolly to behold.
17761,TRACY.,"Domestics idly talk’d of future Tyes,"
17762,TRACY.,And Julian’s Mother of her new Allies.
17763,TRACY.,"She pleas’d her boy by praises of his choice,"
17764,TRACY.,"Before he chose, and gave, unask’d, her voice;      680"
17765,TRACY.,Bade him by Care assiduous to retain
17766,TRACY.,The Influence that his Sex and age must gain;
17767,TRACY.,"He was no Child, and, if he were, ’twas just"
17768,TRACY.,For him to look to what he had to trust.
17769,TRACY.,"His Father left him with involv’d Affairs,"
17770,TRACY.,Who had no Mercy on his Wife and Heirs;
17771,TRACY.,"He must take heed to what he was about,"
17772,TRACY.,Nor fill a Parent’s mind with foolish Doubt.
17773,TRACY.,"His Person, Mind, Connection, and Degree"
17774,TRACY.,Might win a wealthier Maid than Emely;      690
17775,TRACY.,"But still, as providence had seem’d to knit"
17776,TRACY.,"The destin’d knot, she deem’d it right and fit,"
17777,TRACY.,"And charged him, on her blessing, well to play"
17778,TRACY.,"His Cards, and never throw his Luck away!"
17779,TRACY.,"Young as he was, the Boy was not at ease."
17780,TRACY.,He now had Motives [and] designs to please;
17781,TRACY.,"They hurt his feelings, and he seem’d to trace"
17782,TRACY.,Something unpleasant in his Guardian’s face.
17783,TRACY.,"He now had thoughts that he could not express,"
17784,TRACY.,And fear’d that Guardian more and lov’d him less.      700
17785,TRACY.,"But still, to please his Emely, he strove"
17786,TRACY.,With all the eager Haste of boyish Love.
17787,TRACY.,"She, pure and thoughtless, of all meaning void,"
17788,TRACY.,"Their walks, their Sports, their Liberty enjoy’d,"
17789,TRACY.,But was at times offended by the Care
17790,TRACY.,And strange politeness she disdain’d to share.
17791,TRACY.,"When with his Mother Tracy chanc’d to come,"
17792,TRACY.,"Who had no Care, no Manhood, to assume,"
17793,TRACY.,"The happy Damsel join’d the laughing boy,"
17794,TRACY.,And all was careless Ecstacy and Joy.      710
17795,TRACY.,"He had no Love, no Hate, nor Fear nor Hope,"
17796,TRACY.,But gave [his] Humour and his passions Scope;
17797,TRACY.,"And oft, when Julian warn’d the nymph to shun"
17798,TRACY.,"The Rain and Cold, the Shadow and the Sun,"
17799,TRACY.,Her favourite Cecil to the roughest Play
17800,TRACY.,"Would call, and quarrel if she dar’d delay."
17801,TRACY.,"Yet she perversely from the Kindness fled,"
17802,TRACY.,And follow’d Cecil wheresoe’er he led;
17803,TRACY.,Nor had the Garden or the Lawn a spot
17804,TRACY.,Where they could venture and they ventur’d not.      720
17805,TRACY.,Now from domestic Joy and Youthful Love
17806,TRACY.,To woes domestic we awhile remove.
17807,TRACY.,"[Ere] the Good Man his fiftieth year had seen,"
17808,TRACY.,With those he number’d who had living been.
17809,TRACY.,"Slight was the Warning, and as slight the Need,"
17810,TRACY.,When the pure Soul was from the Body freed;
17811,TRACY.,When the griev’d Wife and antient Parent shed
17812,TRACY.,Their Tears of envying Anguish o’er the Dead.
17813,TRACY.,"They saw before them but a length of Woes,"
17814,TRACY.,"And long’d for Death, and languish’d for repose.      730"
17815,TRACY.,"But the fair Child, their pity and their pride,"
17816,TRACY.,"Their sad affections to the World allied,"
17817,TRACY.,And on their natures’ Tenderness she wrought;      }
17818,TRACY.,Till they some transient fits of Pleasure caught      }
17819,TRACY.,"And, first forbidding, next received them sought.      }"
17820,TRACY.,Seldom the Boys their fairy Mistress met;
17821,TRACY.,The Mother sigh’d and lov’d retirement yet;
17822,TRACY.,"Nor could she part with the consoling Aid,"
17823,TRACY.,But purchas’d Help to teach the willing Maid.
17824,TRACY.,"Joy of her House, the Child sustained her part,      740"
17825,TRACY.,And won from woe severe the wounded Heart.
17826,TRACY.,"The good old Man, to Heav’n’s will resign’d,"
17827,TRACY.,With Faith and Hope sustain’d his modest Mind.
17828,TRACY.,"Time and Reflection had their sure Success,"
17829,TRACY.,And soft’ned Sorrow rose from deep distress.
17830,TRACY.,To this Religion added thoughts that force
17831,TRACY.,The keenest Anguish from its wasteful Course.
17832,TRACY.,"Oft would the Widow, oft the Sire, relate"
17833,TRACY.,Their lofty Hopes of an eternal State;
17834,TRACY.,Of Souls that meet in regions where they dwell      750
17835,TRACY.,In bliss untold and indescribable.
17836,TRACY.,"Then, when unceasing Love had brought in View"
17837,TRACY.,"A Form so graceful and an Heart so true,"
17838,TRACY.,And every Action painted to the Life
17839,TRACY.,"For the fond father and deserted wife,"
17840,TRACY.,Hope stronger still before the Image cast
17841,TRACY.,"A veil oblivious, to conceal the past;"
17842,TRACY.,Then on the future threw so bright a ray
17843,TRACY.,That Sorrow smil’d in Tears and softly died away.
17844,TRACY.,"So, when the heavy Rain[s] more gentle grow      760}"
17845,TRACY.,"O’er the soft Shower bright gleams the colour’d bow,      }"
17846,TRACY.,That never shines abroad till first the Waters flow;      }
17847,TRACY.,"But on the Eye no cheerful Colours fall,"
17848,TRACY.,"When not a Cloud appears, or when ’tis cloudy all."
17849,TRACY.,"Now for the World their Emely they train’d,"
17850,TRACY.,Who in that World their only good remain’d;
17851,TRACY.,"For her they read, and, to enlarge her Views,      }"
17852,TRACY.,"Gave Books t’ instruct her, to inform, amuse,      }"
17853,TRACY.,And [chose] the best of each; and well they knew to choose.      }
17854,TRACY.,"Some were forbid, and these they laid aside      770"
17855,TRACY.,Nor [raised] a Wish that was not gratified;
17856,TRACY.,Nor were these Parents so extremely nice
17857,TRACY.,That their fair Charge must not be told of Vice.
17858,TRACY.,They better knew the texture of the Mind;
17859,TRACY.,"Nor kept a lively Lass, and curious, blind;"
17860,TRACY.,But of the useful and the good supplied
17861,TRACY.,"A copious Store, and she was satisfied."
17862,TRACY.,"The kind old Student, to oblige the Maid,"
17863,TRACY.,The Tricks of Science with its pride display’d:
17864,TRACY.,"The Captive Mouse, half-dead for want of Air,      780"
17865,TRACY.,"Had Freedom granted at the Virgin’s prayer,"
17866,TRACY.,Who had no pleasure in th’ exhausted House
17867,TRACY.,To view the panting of the captive Mouse.
17868,TRACY.,"[For her] Electric fire illum’d the Gloom,"
17869,TRACY.,And mimic Lightning flash’d along the room;
17870,TRACY.,"Maidens and men, the nymph to entertain,"
17871,TRACY.,With rueful Wonder felt the numbing pain;
17872,TRACY.,Amaz’d to think what Creature could bestow
17873,TRACY.,Strokes without force and pain without a blow.
17874,TRACY.,"All on a Stool, high raised on feet of Glass,      790"
17875,TRACY.,She saw the fiery Sparks her fingers pass;
17876,TRACY.,All who approached the pungent Spark sustain’d;
17877,TRACY.,They felt alike who gave it and who gain’d;
17878,TRACY.,No Arrows Cupid sent from Heart to Heart
17879,TRACY.,Were so alike or gave such equal Smart.
17880,TRACY.,"A Pleasant Sight it was the Sire to view,"
17881,TRACY.,"In loose, long gown, that brush’d the morning Dew,"
17882,TRACY.,"With feeble Call the lively Girl delay,"
17883,TRACY.,And his light Learning mid her flowers display;
17884,TRACY.,"Then show the Species, Genus, Order, Class      800"
17885,TRACY.,To the half-wond’ring and half-laughing Lass.
17886,TRACY.,With Care parental he the learned Swede
17887,TRACY.,From all his folly and Allusion freed;
17888,TRACY.,"And, when they spake of Stamina and threads,      }"
17889,TRACY.,Nor Wives nor Husbands floated in their Heads;      }
17890,TRACY.,"And flowers were flowers alone, and were not bridal beds.      }"
17891,TRACY.,Polygamy in all its various kind
17892,TRACY.,Was never suffer’d to disturb the Mind;
17893,TRACY.,Nor could she in a simple Daisy see
17894,TRACY.,"(Ah, Crime!) superfluous polygamy;      810"
17895,TRACY.,In a bright Sunflower she had not the pain
17896,TRACY.,To find this same polygamy again;
17897,TRACY.,Nor could a Marigold the more approve
17898,TRACY.,To find it there was necessary Love.
17899,TRACY.,"As up the hill and o’er the heath they stray’d,"
17900,TRACY.,A curious form beside the hawthorn laid.
17901,TRACY.,A silvery white its outer surface shone;
17902,TRACY.,"Its bottom ended in a pointed Cone,"
17903,TRACY.,One inch in length; and in the broader Space
17904,TRACY.,Was the faint picture of an human face—      820
17905,TRACY.,"Dead to the Eye, but in the hand a Strife"
17906,TRACY.,Of waking Nature shew’d the latent Life.
17907,TRACY.,"“Now tell me, Maiden, from that silver shape,"
17908,TRACY.,What prison’d Beauty shall from hence escape?
17909,TRACY.,"Shall a slow Moth the silvery Prison leave,"
17910,TRACY.,"That, when a Worm, she left her food to weave,"
17911,TRACY.,And slowly flutter in the dying day—
17912,TRACY.,The Schoolboy’s Pleasure and the Swallow’s prey?
17913,TRACY.,"Or shall, with broader Wing and brighter dyes,"
17914,TRACY.,"A soaring Creature from her Coffin rise,      830"
17915,TRACY.,Spread to the Morning Sun her glowing Hue
17916,TRACY.,Hang o’er the honey’d flower and drink the nectar dew?”
17917,TRACY.,"Young Emely the pencil’d figure view’d,      }"
17918,TRACY.,"And knew the Image that would soon [protrude],      }"
17919,TRACY.,That she with rapture o’er the Hills pursu’d.      }
17920,TRACY.,"“I know her well,” the infant Beauty cried:"
17921,TRACY.,“The Woodland Glory and the Garden’s pride;
17922,TRACY.,"I see the Colours o’er her form bespread,"
17923,TRACY.,"The softned brown, faint green and dusky red,"
17924,TRACY.,And [glowing] eye of [a] bright azure blue      840
17925,TRACY.,On either [angle] of the Wings I view.
17926,TRACY.,"Beneath, her shading puts all art to Shame;"
17927,TRACY.,"Queen of her race she reigns, and Io is her Name.”"
17928,TRACY.,Sometimes the Rock within the Quarry gave
17929,TRACY.,The Shell that roll’d beneath the Ocean’s wave—
17930,TRACY.,"Shell now no more: a gradual Change came on,"
17931,TRACY.,And the thin Shell became the Solid Stone.
17932,TRACY.,"Yet Shape and Size and Hue and Hinge remain’d,"
17933,TRACY.,And a Stone-fish the rocky Valves contain’d.
17934,TRACY.,This led to Questions from the curious Mind;      850
17935,TRACY.,But who shall Answers to these Questions find?
17936,TRACY.,"“Such Wonders are,” replied the Sire; “no more"
17937,TRACY.,"I know, my Child; be silent and adore!”"
17938,TRACY.,Oft would the Lass with either Parent go
17939,TRACY.,And hear the wonted Tales of village woe.
17940,TRACY.,"She saw their bounteous Hand the bliss impart,"
17941,TRACY.,And they the Gladness of her feeling Heart;
17942,TRACY.,"Yet Prudence here the various Tale explain’d,"
17943,TRACY.,The Signs of Grief sincere and Sorrow feign’d.
17944,TRACY.,"Yet here they own’d how much our rules deceive,      860"
17945,TRACY.,"And, e’en when wrong, ’tis Kindness to believe."
17946,TRACY.,"By Preachers guided, by her Parents train’d"
17947,TRACY.,The favour’d Beauty Grace and Knowledge gain’d;
17948,TRACY.,"A happy Temper and a Soul sincere,"
17949,TRACY.,"A lively Spirit and a Conscience clear,"
17950,TRACY.,A Taste that seem’d instinctively to fly
17951,TRACY.,"The base and mean, were found in Emely."
17952,TRACY.,"Hers was a Beauty every Eye approv’d,"
17953,TRACY.,Hers the meek sweetness that all tempers mov’d.
17954,TRACY.,"The Grave esteem’d her, and the gay and light      870"
17955,TRACY.,Affected Prudence in the Virgin’s sight.
17956,TRACY.,"Thus Good and happy, of her Friends the pride,"
17957,TRACY.,"No Wishes hidden and no Wants denied,"
17958,TRACY.,"She liv’d serenely, honour’d and belov’d,"
17959,TRACY.,"Meek tho’ indulged, and modest tho’ approv’d,"
17960,TRACY.,"The Sick, the Poor, the suffering and oppress’d"

18851,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,To muse in secret and indulge your Woe.
18852,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Pride of my Life, but Grief as well as Pride,"
18853,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Why will you thus in Wretchedness abide?
18854,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Why in these Scenes of Solitude delight?
18855,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"It may be soothing, but cannot be right.”"
18856,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Thus spake the Squire; for he was vext to find      30
18857,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,His Sister sad; for all he meant was kind.
18858,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Yet this he added—“I will not believe
18859,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"In thy Religion, if I see thee grieve."
18860,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Of that Religion hast thou not enough
18861,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,To baffle Grief and make thee Sorrow-Proof?
18862,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Hast thou not said, that all Mankind endure"
18863,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Finds in their Faith a Comfort or a Cure?
18864,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"I know thy Prayers are offered day by day,"

18866,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"To war with Grace—Come, take a chearful View      40"
18867,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Of Life, and think its Pleasures are thy due!"
18868,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“Why mourn an Husband, were he good, so long?"
18869,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,But One like thine! ’Tis desperately wrong!
18870,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"One who deceived thee, whom we should despise"
18871,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"A Wretch, all Falsehood, Treachery and Disguise!"
18872,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“Nay, my Matilda, let me not offend:"
18873,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Would’st have thy Brother be a Villain’s Friend?
18874,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"A vile, false, flattering Scoundrel—nay, but how"
18875,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Can you thus grieve? I’m speaking kindly now—
18876,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"A base deceiver, studied to betray;      50"
18877,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"But, come! he’s gone, and I’ve no more to say.”"
18878,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Pensive and silent, passive in her Woe,"
18879,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"She went with him, though indisposed to go;"
18880,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,And to the loud Reproof and threat’ning tone
18881,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"She school’d her Heart, and said, “I’ll grieve alone.”"
18882,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"When near their Home, again the Brother cried:"
18883,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“Come let thy Griefs be still, thine Eyes be dried!"
18884,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Here Captain Gale, the May’r too from the Town,"

18889,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“He was not foreign,” that alone she said,"
18890,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,And that he heard not.—Then the hours were spent
18891,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,In small discourse and petty merriment—
18892,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Such as the Men with little Minds admire;
18893,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Such as became the May’r and pleased the Squire;
18894,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Such as the Mayor’s and the Captain’s Wife
18895,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Could best display and picture to the Life—
18896,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,All the small Scandal of a Place so small      70
18897,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,That we might wonder whence arose it all;
18898,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"With Borough-Business of such high Concern,"
18899,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,That poor Matilda was compell’d to learn
18900,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"What Honours fell upon their Heads, and how"
18901,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"The worthy Burgess took the Member’s Bow,"
18902,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"And how returned, and what a joyous Look"

18904,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"The Brother, grieving for the patient Grief"
18905,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Of the fair Mourner, strove for her Relief;"
18906,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"And, finding Wrath disturbed her gentle Breast,      80"
18907,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,In gentler Tone his Love and Care exprest.
18908,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“’Tis now five Years, and this about the day,"
18909,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Since the Bellair was wreckt in Liddel-Bay;

18911,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,As for our Sins destroying Angels come.
18912,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"He came alone, in Misery, to our Care;"

18922,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"To seek this Angel-Dæmon, Friend and Foe.”"
18923,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,The gentle Mourner for a while appeared
18924,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Absorbed in thought; her Brother’s Words she feared,"
18925,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"His Love she owned; she thanked him from her Soul,"
18926,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,But begged he would these angry thoughts controul.      100
18927,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“You must not meet,” she said, with deep-drawn Sigh"
18928,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"And flowing Tears—“you must not, nor must I.”"
18929,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,There was a Pause; but Richard could not hide
18930,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,The rising Anger or the wounded Pride.
18931,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“Ask me not, Sister, while Your Wrong is mine,"

18933,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"But, if I could my Sense of Wrong subdue,"
18934,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,I must revenge an Insult offered you.
18935,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Let him for all account, for all repent,"
18936,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,For all atone; and then I may relent.      110
18937,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Him I must seek; for never Man of Sense

18944,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Let all that Death can touch untroubled lie,"
18945,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,And who would strive with that which cannot die!”—
18946,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,“Is he no more?”—
18947,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,“’Tis painful to reply.
18948,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,To us he is; and let the Subject die!      120
18949,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"For, if he lives, he suffers, and he feels"

18953,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"You may forgive your Husband, if you can;"
18954,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,But I must wreak my Vengeance on the Man.
18955,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,You had refused him; but for my Request

18960,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,The better Spirit of the Man was dead.
18961,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,You saw he grieved and moped alone about;

18963,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"He for a Man of Worth awhile was known,"
18964,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,And then the Devil came to claim his own.”—
18965,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“No more, my Brother! I must now prepare"

18981,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Then, was it so? Alas! ere yet he fled,"
18982,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,I saw that something in his Mind had bred.
18983,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"But yet I spoke not, thinking every Day"

19244,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Within the neighbouring Town were some whose Cares

19278,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Here you can scarsely live, and there you can but die.”      }"
19279,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"This was not said, but something not so rude—"
19280,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"And this was meant, and this was understood."
19281,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Against Advice the placid Mother strove;
19282,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"She fought with Learning, but complied with Love."
19283,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,The Coast of France appear’d new Strength to give
19284,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"And Hope, exulting, told that she would live."
19285,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,“But she must move; must ever be employed;

19289,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“Now where, Matilda, shall we go to-day?”"
19290,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"So Richard said, as he was wont to say;"
19291,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,“Where bend our Steps?” He took his Glass in Hand:
19292,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,“Here comes a Boat; suppose we see it land?”
19293,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"They saw it land—“And, Boatmen, who are these?”—"
19294,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"“A Priest they say, and from beyond the Seas."
19295,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,But he who leans upon the Friend beside
19296,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Is going fast; we judged he must have died—
19297,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Coming for Health; and, if he means to stay      450"
19298,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Till it arrives, he’ll never go away.”"
19299,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"So spake the Seamen; when, approaching nigh,"
19300,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Matilda stopt and, with an heavy sigh,"
19301,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"Dropt on the Shore. Her Brother, frightened, flew"
19302,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"To give her Aid—she breathed, and, “Is it true?”"

19320,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,To lose all Comfort in this World and live      470
19321,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,Without one Joy that Life or Love can give;

19340,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"He told what Hovels then he sought, and where      490"

19342,THE DESERTED FAMILY.,"He sought the Mine, and in that World below"

21057,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,All else past off like Summer Clouds;
21058,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"And that fair Youth, a Slave no more,"
21059,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Was now attended by applauding Crowds,"
21060,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,And Robes of royal State he wore;
21061,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"And ever, as this Youth the Dreamer viewed,"
21062,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,He seemed his very Self to [see];
21063,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Save that this other Self was new indued
21064,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,With Power that his must never be;
21065,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"For how could one be great, who felt he was not free!"
21066,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,
21067,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He saw that other self beside a Throne,      30"
21068,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Ennobled and admired of noble Men;
21069,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He saw him too, retired, alone,"
21070,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Virtuous, and still more happy, then."
21071,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He seemed as fitted for his State,"
21072,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,And not by Love of Greatness led;
21073,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,But as a Man advanced by Fate
21074,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,To be a mighty People’s Head;
21075,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"For, though so high, so near a Throne,"
21076,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,He served his God aright and worshipped Him alone.
21077,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,
21078,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Then he again beheld that Youth      40
21079,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,With Wonder and increased delight!
21080,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"For the young Dreamer saw the inward Truth,"
21081,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"And saw that all he did was just and right,"
21082,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Acting as ever in his Mother’s sight;
21083,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"And much he loved, but knew not why,"
21084,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,As Hearts are drawn by secret Chain;
21085,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"When soon he heard a Voice that said, “Draw nigh,"
21086,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,And see what Truth and Piety obtain!”
21087,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,
21088,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"While yet the Voice was heard, behold, there came"
21089,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"A Princess fair, or one in princely Guise;      50"
21090,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"The sleeping Shepherd feels a sudden flame,"
21091,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,And in his Slumber sighs.
21092,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Yet, when he saw that noble Youth address"
21093,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"The royal Maiden in a lover’s Style,"
21094,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He felt no jealous Pangs his Heart oppress,"
21095,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"But joyful saw the soft, assenting Smile."
21096,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,
21097,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Scenes change.—The Pair are wedded and are blest;
21098,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He ruled the Land, but sterile was the Earth—"
21099,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Dry as the parchèd Rock, yet not distress’d—"
21100,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"An unseen Plenty came upon the Dearth,      60"
21101,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Like a full Stream; and lo! as Merchants came
21102,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"A mingled race, to buy their Households food,"
21103,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,All praise his foresight; all revere his Name—
21104,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"The Great, the Wise, the Bountiful and Good!"
21105,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Then by that noble Youth, behold, there stood—"
21106,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Strange Fate!—his Brothers, trembling at their Lot."
21107,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,The Lordly Man them question’d; they replied:
21108,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"“Our Father lives; One Brother, and beside"
21109,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"That one”—they looked abashed—“one more, my Lord, is not.”"
21110,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,
21111,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He then beheld his Father and his Race,      70"
21112,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Who found Protection from that bounteous hand.
21113,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Jacob had Honour, and his Brethren Grace,"
21114,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,And Joseph saw them in that Presence stand.
21115,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Strange joy he felt; for in his Dream
21116,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,He as that princely Youth did seem;
21117,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,And felt that Glory new of all the Scene.
21118,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"But, as the Tidings of that Glory rose,"
21119,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,The gorgeous Scene appeared about to close;
21120,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"For all the People shout, and all the Host"
21121,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Of Egypt join’d, along the Red-Sea Coast,      80"
21122,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,In one loud peal of Praise; and was it joy?
21123,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"Oh, no! it was the call his Masters gave,"
21124,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,That from his Vision drew the Hebrew Boy
21125,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,To know himself a Slave!
21126,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"While on his Ear that Shout of Triumph broke,"
21127,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,Joseph unwilling to the Call awoke;
21128,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"He saw far off the Egyptian Turrets gleam,"
21129,JOSEPH’S DREAM.,"And wept his cruel Fate, and longed again to dream."
