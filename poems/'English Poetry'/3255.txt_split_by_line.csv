2216,IN HER PRECINCTS,And the square of each window a dull black blur
2217,IN HER PRECINCTS,Where showed no stir:
2218,IN HER PRECINCTS,"Yes, her gloom within at the lack of me"
2219,IN HER PRECINCTS,Seemed matching mine at the lack of her.

2237,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,SILENTLY I footed by an uphill road
2238,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,That led from my abode to a spot yew-boughed;
2239,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,"Yellowly the sun sloped low down to westward,"
2240,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,And dark was the east with cloud.
2241,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,
2242,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,"Then, amid the shadow of that livid sad east,"
2243,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,"Where the light was least, and a gate stood wide,"
2244,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,"Something flashed the fire of the sun that was facing it,"
2245,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,Like a brief blaze on that side.
2246,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,
2247,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,Looking hard and harder I knew what it meant—
2248,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene;

2250,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,"Turning to the road from his green,"
2251,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,
2252,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,To take his last journey forth—he who in his prime
2253,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,Trudged so many a time from that gate athwart the land!
2254,A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES,"Thus a farewell to me he signalled on his grave-way,"

4241,IN A WAITING-ROOM,
4242,IN A WAITING-ROOM,But next there came
4243,IN A WAITING-ROOM,Like the eastern flame
4244,IN A WAITING-ROOM,"Of some high altar, children—a pair—"
4245,IN A WAITING-ROOM,Who laughed at the fly-blown pictures there.
4246,IN A WAITING-ROOM,"“Here are the lovely ships that we,"
4247,IN A WAITING-ROOM,"Mother, are by and by going to see!"
4248,IN A WAITING-ROOM,"When we get there it’s ’most sure to be fine,"

4250,IN A WAITING-ROOM,
4251,IN A WAITING-ROOM,It rained on the skylight with a din
4252,IN A WAITING-ROOM,As we waited and still no train came in;
4253,IN A WAITING-ROOM,But the words of the child in the squalid room
4254,IN A WAITING-ROOM,Had spread a glory through the gloom.

4665,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,"Then younger, younger she freshed, to the year"

4670,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,“Thus far is good—

4672,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,But alas for me.  He shook his head:

4674,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,"And she waned child-fair,"
4675,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,And to babyhood.
4676,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,
4677,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,Still less in mien
4678,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,"To my great sorrow became she slowly,"

4680,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,In his checkless griff;
4681,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,And it was as if

4683,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,
4684,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,"“Better,” I plained,"
4685,THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS,“She were dead as before!  The memory of her

4728,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,That at some moments fall thereon
4729,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,"From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing,"
4730,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,And they shaped in my imagining

4741,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,That there was nothing in my belief.
4742,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,
4743,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,Yet I wanted to look and see

4746,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,"A shape which, somehow, there may be.”"
4747,THE SHADOW ON THE STONE,"So I went on softly from the glade,"

5470,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,The woman passing came to a pause
5471,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,"By the heaped white shapes of wreath and cross,"
5472,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,And looked upon where the other was.
5473,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,
5474,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,And as she mused there thus spoke she:

5485,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,
5486,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,“‘I would change for that lass here and now!

5497,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,
5498,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,“And I pray each hour for your soul’s repose

5505,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,
5506,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,"“O sweetheart, neither shall I clasp you,"
5507,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,"For the foe this day has pierced me through,"
5508,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,And sent me to where she is.  Adieu!—
5509,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,
5510,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,“And forget not when the night-wind’s whine
5511,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,"Calls over this turf where her limbs recline,"

5513,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,
5514,THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE,"There was a cry by the white-flowered mound,"
