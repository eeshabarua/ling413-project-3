41,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,We propose to introduce our 'Specimens' by a short Essay on the Origin
42,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and Progress of English Poetry on to the days of Chaucer and of Gower.
43,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Having called, in conjunction with many other critics, Chaucer 'the"
44,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Father of English Poetry,' to seek to go back further may seem like"
45,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"pursuing antenatal researches. But while Chaucer was the sun, a certain"
46,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"glimmering dawn had gone before him, and to reflect that, is the object"
47,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of the following pages.
48,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
49,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
50,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Britain, when the Romans invaded it, was a barbarous country; and although"
51,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"subjugated and long held by that people, they seem to have left it nearly"
52,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as uncultivated and illiterate as they found it. 'No magnificent remains,'"
53,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"says Macaulay, 'of Latian porches and aqueducts are to be found in Britain."
54,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,No writer of British birth is to be reckoned among the masters of Latin
55,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"poetry and eloquence. It is not probable that the islanders were, at any"
56,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"time, generally familiar with the tongue of their Italian rulers. From"
57,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Atlantic to the vicinity of the Rhine the Latin has, during many"
58,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"centuries, been predominant. It drove out the Celtic--it was not driven"
59,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"out by the Teutonic--and it is at this day the basis of the French,"
60,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Spanish, and Portuguese languages. In our island the Latin appears never"
61,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to have superseded the old Gaelic speech, and could not stand its ground"
62,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,before the German.' It was in the fifth century that that modification
63,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of the German or Teutonic speech called the Anglo-Saxon was introduced
64,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,into this country. It soon asserted its superiority over the British
65,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"tongue, which seemed to retreat before it, reluctantly and proudly, like"
66,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a lion, into the mountain-fastnesses of Wales or to the rocky sea-beach"
67,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Cornwall. The triumph was not completed all at once, but from the"
68,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"beginning it was secure. The bards of Wales continued to sing, but their"
69,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"strains resembled the mutterings of thunder among their own hills, only"
70,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"half heard in the distant valleys, and exciting neither curiosity nor awe."
71,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For five centuries, with the exception of some Latin words added by the"
72,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"preachers of Christianity, the Anglo-Saxon language continued much as it"
73,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"was when first introduced. Barbarous as the manners of the people were,"
74,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,literature was by no means left without a witness. Its chief cultivators
75,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"were the monks and other religious persons, who spent their leisure in"
76,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"multiplying books, either by original composition or by transcription,"
77,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"including treatises on theology, historical chronicles, and a great"
78,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,abundance and variety of poetical productions. These were written at first
79,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"exclusively in Latin, but occasionally, in process of time, in the Anglo-"
80,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Saxon tongue. The theology taught in them was, no doubt, crude and"
81,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"corrupted, the history was stuffed with fables, and the poetry was rough"
82,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and bald in the extreme; but still they furnished a food fitted for the
83,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,awakening mind of the age. When the Christian religion reached Great
84,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Britain, it brought necessarily with it an impulse to intellect as well"
85,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as to morality. So startling are the facts it relates, so broad and deep"
86,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the principles it lays down, so humane the spirit it inculcates, and so"
87,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"ravishing the hopes it awakens, that, however disguised in superstition"
88,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and clouded by imperfect representation, it never fails to produce, in all"
89,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"countries to which it comes, a resurrection of the nation's virtue, and a"
90,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"revival, for a time at least, of the nation's political and intellectual"
91,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,energy and genius. Hence we find the very earliest literary names in our
92,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,early annals are those of Christian missionaries. Such is said to have
93,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"been Gildas, a Briton, who lived in the first part of the sixth century,"
94,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and is the reputed author of a short history of Britain in Latin. Such was
95,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the still more apocryphal Nennius, also called, till of late, the writer"
96,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of a small Latin historical work. Such was St Columbanus, who was born"
97,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,in Ireland in 560; became a monk in the Irish monastery of Benchor; and
98,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"afterwards, at the head of twelve disciples, preached Christianity, in its"
99,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"most ascetic form, in England and in France; founded in the latter country"
100,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"various monasteries; and, when banished by Queen Brunehaut on account of"
101,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"his stern inflexibility of character, went to Switzerland, and then to"
102,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Lombardy, proselytising the heathen, and defending, by his letters and"
103,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"other writings, the peculiar tenets of the Irish Church in reference to"
104,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the time of the celebration of Easter and to the popular heresies of the
105,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"day. He died October 2, 615, in the monastery of Bobbio; and his religious"
106,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,treatises and Latin poetry gave an undoubted impulse to the age's progress
107,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,in letters.
108,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
109,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"About this period the better sort of Saxons, both clergy and laity, got"
110,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"into the habit of visiting Rome; while Rome, in her turn, sent emissaries"
111,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to England. Thus, while the one insensibly imbibed new knowledge as well"
112,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as devotion from the great centre, the other brought with them to our"
113,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"shores importations of books, including copies of such religious classics"
114,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as Josephus and Chrysostom, and of such literary classics as Homer. About"
115,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"680, died Caedmon, a monk of Whitby, one of the first who composed in"
116,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Anglo-Saxon, and some of whose compositions are preserved. Strange and"
117,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,myth-like stories are told by Bede about this remarkable natural genius.
118,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"He was originally a cow-herd. Partly from want of training, and partly"
119,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"from bashfulness, when the harp was given him in the hall, and he was"
120,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"asked, as all others were, to raise the voice of song, Caedmon had often"
121,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to abscond in confusion. On one occasion he had retired to the stable,"
122,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,where he fell into a sound sleep. He dreamed that a stranger appeared to
123,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"him, and said, 'Caedmon, sing me something.' Caedmon replied that it was"
124,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,his incapacity to sing which had brought him to take refuge in the stable.
125,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'Nay,' said the stranger, 'but thou hast something to sing.' 'What shall I"
126,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"sing?' rejoined Caedmon. 'Sing the Creation,' and thereupon he began to"
127,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"pour out verses, which, when he awoke, he remembered, repeated, and to"
128,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"which he added others as good. The first lines are, as translated into"
129,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"English, the following:--"
130,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
131,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Now let us praise
132,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The Guardian of heaven,"
133,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The might of the Creator
134,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,And his counsel--
135,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Glory!--Father of men!
136,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"He first created,"
137,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For the children of men,"
138,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Heaven as a roof--
139,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The holy Creator!
140,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Then the world--
141,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Guardian of mankind!
142,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Eternal Lord!
143,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Produced afterwards
144,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Earth for men--
145,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Almighty Master!'
146,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
147,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Our readers all remember the well-known story of Coleridge falling asleep
148,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,over Purchas's 'Pilgrims'; how the poem of 'Kubla Khan' came rushing
149,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"from dreamland upon his soul; and how, when awakened, he wrote it down,"
150,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and found it to be, if not sense, something better--a glorious piece"
151,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of fantastic imagination. We knew a gentleman who, slumbering while in"
152,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a state of bad health, produced, in the course of a few hours, one or"
153,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"two thousand rhymed lines, some of which he repeated in our hearing"
154,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"afterwards, and which were full of point and poetry. We cannot see that"
155,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Caedmon's lines betray any weird inspiration; but when rehearsed the next
156,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"day to the Abbess Hilda, to whom the town-bailiff of Whitby conducted him,"
157,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,she and a circle of learned men pronounced that he had received the gift
158,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of song direct from heaven! They, after one or two other trials of his"
159,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"powers, persuaded him to become a monk in the house of the Abbess, who"
160,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,commanded him to transfer to verse the whole of the Scripture history. It
161,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,is said that he was constantly employed in repeating to himself what he
162,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"had heard; or, as one of his old biographers has it, 'like a clean animal"
163,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"ruminating it, he turned it into most sweet verse.' In this way he wrote"
164,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"or rather improvised a vast quantity of poetry, chiefly on religious"
165,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"subjects. Thorpe, in his edition of this author, has preserved a speech"
166,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Satan, bearing a striking resemblance to some parts of Milton:--"
167,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
168,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'Boiled within him
169,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"His thought about his heart,"
170,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Hot was without him,"
171,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,His due punishment.
172,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"""This narrow place is most unlike"
173,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,That other that we formerly knew
174,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"High in heaven's kingdom,"
175,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Which my master bestowed on me,"
176,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Though we it, for the All-Powerful,"
177,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,May not possess.

184,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Shall possess
185,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,My strong seat;

187,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"And we endure this torment,"

198,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Me hath the clasping of these rings,"
199,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"This hard-polished band,"
200,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Impeded in my course,"
201,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Debarred me from my way.
202,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"My feet are bound,"
203,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,My hands manacled;
204,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Of these hell-doors are
205,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The ways obstructed,"
206,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,So that with aught I cannot
207,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,From these limb-bonds escape.
208,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,About me lie
209,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Huge gratings
210,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Of hard iron,"
211,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Forged with heat,"
212,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,With which me God
213,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Hath fastened by the neck.
214,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind,"
215,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"And that he knew also,"
216,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The Lord of hosts,"
217,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,That should us through Adam
218,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Evil befall,"
219,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"About the realm of heaven,"
220,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Where I had power of my hands.""'"
221,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
222,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Through these rude lines there flashes forth, like fire through a thick"
223,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"dull grating, a powerful conception--one which Milton has borrowed and"
224,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,developed--that of the Evil One feeling in his dark bosom jealousy at
225,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"young Man, almost overpowering his hatred to God; and another conception"
226,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"still more striking, that of the devil's thorough conviction that all"
227,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"his plans and thoughts are entirely known by his great Adversary, and"
228,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,are counteracted before they are formed--
229,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
230,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind.'
231,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
232,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Compare this with Milton's lines--
233,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
234,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'So should I purchase dear
235,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Short intermission, bought with double smart."
236,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,_This knows_ my Punisher; therefore as far
237,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"From granting he, as I from begging peace.'"
238,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
239,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Caedmon saw, without being able fully to express, the complex idea of"
240,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Satan, as distracted between a thousand thoughts, all miserable--tossed"
241,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"between a thousand winds, all hot as hell--'pale ire, envy, and despair'"
242,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,struggling within him--fury at man overlapping anger at God--remorse and
243,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,reckless desperation wringing each other's miserable hands--a sense of
244,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"guilt which will not confess, a fear that will not quake, a sorrow that"
245,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"will not weep, a respect for God which will not worship; and yet,"
246,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"springing out of all these elements, a strange, proud joy, as though"
247,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the torrid soil of Pandemonium should flower, which makes 'the hell he"
248,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"suffers seem a heaven,' compared to what his destiny might be were he"
249,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"either plunged into a deeper abyss, or taken up unchanged to his former"
250,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"abode of glory. This, in part at least, the monk of Whitby discerned;"
251,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,but it was reserved for Milton to embody it in that tremendous figure
252,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"which has since continued to dwindle all the efforts of art, and to"
253,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"haunt, like a reality, the human imagination."
254,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
255,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Passing over some interesting but subordinate Saxon writers, such as"
256,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Ceolfrid, Abbot of Wearmouth; Aldhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury; Felix of"
257,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Croyland; and Alcuine, King Egbert's librarian at York, we come to one"
258,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,who himself formed an era in the history of our early literature--the
259,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,venerable Bede. This famous man was educated in the monastery of
260,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Wearmouth, and there appears to have spent the whole of his quiet,"
261,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"innocent, and studious life. He was the very sublimation of a book-worm."
262,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"One might fancy him becoming at last, as in the 'Metamorphoses' of Ovid,"
263,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"one of the books, or rolls of vellum and parchment over which he con-"
264,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stantly pored. That he did not marry, or was given in marriage, we are"
265,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"certain; but there is little evidence that he even ate or drank, walked"
266,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,or slept. To read and to write seemed the 'be all and the end all' of
267,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,his existence. Important as well as numerous were his contributions
268,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,to literature. He translated from the Scriptures. He wrote religious
269,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"treatises, biographies, and commentaries upon portions of Holy Writ."
270,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Besides his very valuable Ecclesiastical History, he composed various"
271,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,pieces of Latin poetry. His works in all were forty-four in number: and
272,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,it is said that on the very day of his death (it took place in 735) he
273,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"was dictating to his amanuensis, and had just completed a book. His works"
274,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"are wonderful for his time, and not the less interesting for a fine"
275,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"cobweb of fable which is woven over parts of them, and which seems in"
276,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"keeping with their venerable character. Thus, in speaking of the Magi who"
277,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"visited the infant Redeemer, he is very particular in describing their"
278,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"age, appearance, and offerings. Melchior, the first, was old, had gray"
279,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"hair, and a long beard; and offered 'gold' to Christ, in, acknowledgment"
280,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of His sovereignty. Gaspar, the second, was young, and had no beard;"
281,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and he offered 'frankincense,' in recognition of our Lord's divinity."
282,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Balthasar, the third, was of a dark complexion, had a large beard, and"
283,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"offered 'myrrh' to our Saviour's humanity. We should, we confess, miss"
284,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,such pleasant little myths in other old books besides Bede's Histories.
285,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"They seem appropriate to ancient works, as the beard is to the goat"
286,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,or the hermit; and the truth that lies in them is not difficult to
287,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,eliminate. The next name of note in our literary annals is that of the
288,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"great Alfred. Surely if ever man was not only before his age, but before"
289,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'all ages,' it was he. A palm of the tropics growing on a naked Highland"
290,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"mountain-side, or an English oak bending over one of the hot springs of"
291,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Hecla, were not a stranger or more preternatural sight than a man like"
292,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Alfred appearing in a century like the ninth. A thousand theories about
293,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"men being the creatures of their age, the products of circumstances, &c.,"
294,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,sink into abeyance beside the facts of his life; and we are driven to the
295,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,good old belief that to some men the 'inspiration of the Almighty giveth
296,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"understanding;' and that their wisdom, their genius, and their excellency"
297,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,do not proceed from them-selves. On his deeds of valour and patriotism it
298,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,is not necessary to dwell. These form the popular and bepraised side of
299,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"his character, but they give a very inadequate idea of the whole. On one"
300,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,occasion he visited the Danish camp--a king disguised as a harper; but
301,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"he was, all his life long, a harper disguised as a king. He was at once"
302,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a warrior, a legislator, an architect, a shipbuilder, a philosopher,"
303,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a scholar, and a poet. His great object, as avowed in his last will,"
304,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,was to leave his people 'free as their own thoughts.' Hence he bent the
305,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"whole force of his mind, first, to defend them from foreign foes, by"
306,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,encouraging the new naval strength he had himself established; and then
307,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to cultivate their intellects, and make them, as well as their country,"
308,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,worth defending. Let us quote the glowing words of Burke:--'He was
309,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,indefatigable in his endeavours to bring into England men of learning in
310,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"all branches from every part of Europe, and unbounded in his liberality"
311,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,to them. He enacted by a law that every person possessed of two hides of
312,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,land should send their children to school until sixteen. He enterprised
313,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,even a greater design than that of forming the growing generation--to
314,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"instruct even the grown, enjoining all his sheriffs and other officers"
315,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"immediately to apply themselves to learning, or to quit their offices."
316,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Whatever trouble he took to extend the benefits of learning among his
317,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"subjects, he shewed the example himself, and applied to the cultivation"
318,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of his mind with unparalleled diligence and success. He could neither
319,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"read nor write at twelve years old, but he improved his time in such"
320,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a manner, that he became one of the most knowing men of his age, in"
321,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"geometry, in philosophy, in architecture, and in music. He applied"
322,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,himself to the improvement of his native language; he translated several
323,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"valuable works from Latin, and wrote a vast number of poems in the Saxon"
324,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,tongue with a wonderful facility and happiness. He not only excelled in
325,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the theory of the arts and sciences, but possessed a great mechanical"
326,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"genius for the executive part. He improved the manner of shipbuilding,"
327,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"introduced a more beautiful and commodious architecture, and even taught"
328,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,his countrymen the art of making bricks; most of the buildings having
329,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"been of wood before his time--in a word, he comprehended in the greatness"
330,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of his mind the whole of government, and all its parts at once; and what"
331,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,is most difficult to human frailty was at the same time sublime and
332,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,minute.'
333,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
334,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Some exaggeration must be allowed for in all this account of Alfred the
335,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Great. But the fact that he left a stamp in his age so deep,--that"
336,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"nothing except what was good and great has been ascribed to him,--that"
337,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the very fictions told of him are of such _vraisemblance_ and magnitude
338,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as to FIT IN to nothing less than an extraordinary man,--and that, as"
339,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Burke says, 'whatever dark spots of human frailty may have adhered to"
340,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"such a character, are entirely hid in the splendour of many shining"
341,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"qualities and grand virtues, that throw a glory over the obscure period"
342,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in which he lived, and which is for no other reason worthy of our"
343,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"knowledge,'--all proclaim his supremacy. Like many great men,--like"
344,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Julius Caesar, with his epilepsy--or Sir Walter Scott and Byron, with"
345,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"their lameness--or Schleiermacher, with his deformed appearance,--a"
346,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"physical infirmity beset Alfred most of his life, and at last carried"
347,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"him off at a comparatively early age. This was a disease in his bowels,"
348,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"which had long afflicted him, 'without interrupting his designs, or"
349,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"souring his temper.' Nay, who can say that the constant presence of such"
350,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a memento of weakness and mortality did not operate as a strong, quiet"
351,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stimulus to do with his might what his hand found to do--to lower pride,"
352,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and to prompt to labour? If Saladin had had for his companion some such
353,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"faithful hound of sorrow, it would have saved him the ostentatious flag"
354,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stretched over his head, in the hour of wassail, with the inscription,"
355,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'Saladin, Saladin, king of kings! Saladin must die!'"
356,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
357,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Alfred wrote little that was original, but he was a copious translator."
358,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,He rendered into the Anglo-Saxon tongue--which he sought to enrich with
359,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the fatness of other soils--the historical works of Orosius and of Bede;
360,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"nay, it is said the Fables of Aesop, and the Psalms of David--desirous,"
361,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"it would seem, to teach his people morality and religion, through the"
362,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"fine medium, of fiction and poetry."
363,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
364,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Alfric, Archbishop of Canterbury, is the name of another important"
365,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,contributor to Saxon literature. He wrote a grammar of his native
366,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language, which procured him the name of the 'Grammarian,' besides a"
367,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"collection of homilies, some theological treatises, and a translation"
368,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of the first seven books of the Old Testament. In imitation of Alfred,"
369,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"he devoted all his energies to the instruction of the common people,"
370,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"constantly writing in Anglo-Saxon, and avoiding as much as possible the"
371,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"use of compound or obscure words. After him appeared Cynewulf, Bishop of"
372,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Winchester, Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, and others of some note. There"
373,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"was also slowly piled up in the course of ages, and by a succession of"
374,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"authors, that remarkable production, 'The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.' This"
375,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"is thought to have commenced soon after the reign of Alfred, and"
376,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"continued till the times of Henry II. Previous, however, to the Norman"
377,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"invasion, there had been a decided falling off in the learning of the"
378,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Saxons. This arose from various causes. Incessant wars tended to
379,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,conserve and increase the barbarism of the people. Various libraries
380,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of value were destroyed by the incursions of the Danes. And not a few
381,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"bishops, and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, began to consider"
382,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,learning as prejudicial to piety-and grammar and ungodliness were
383,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,thought akin. The effect of this upon the subordinate clergy was most
384,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"pernicious. In the tenth century, Oswald, Archbishop of Canterbury,"
385,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"found the monks of his province so grossly ignorant, not only of"
386,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"letters, but even of the canonical rules of their respective orders,"
387,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,that he required to send to France for competent masters to give them
388,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,instruction.
389,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
390,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"At length came the Conqueror, William, and one battle gave England to"
391,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Normans, which had cost the Romans, the Saxons, and the Danes so"
392,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"much time and blood to acquire. The people were not only conquered, but"
393,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,cowed and crushed. England was as easily and effectually subdued as was
394,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Ireland, sometime after, by Henry II. But while the Conquest was for a"
395,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"season fatal to liberty, it was from the first favourable to every"
396,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"species of literature, art, and poetry. 'The influence,' says Campbell,"
397,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'of the Norman Conquest upon the language of England was like that of a
398,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"great inundation, which at first buries the face of the landscape under"
399,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"its waters, but which, at last subsiding, leaves behind it the elements"
400,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of new beauty and fertility. Its first effect was to degrade the Anglo-
401,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Saxon tongue to the exclusive use of the inferior orders, and by the"
402,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"transference of estates ecclesiastical benefices, and civil dignities to"
403,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Norman possessors, to give the French language, which had begun to"
404,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"prevail at court from the time of Edward the Confessor, a more complete"
405,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,predominance among the higher classes of society. The native gentry of
406,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"England were either driven into exile, or depressed into a state of"
407,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"dependence on their conqueror, which habituated them to speak his"
408,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language. On the other hand, we received from the Normans the first"
409,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,germs of romantic poetry; and our language was ultimately indebted to
410,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,them for a wealth and compass of expression which it probably would not
411,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,have otherwise possessed.'
412,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
413,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The Anglo-Saxon, however, held its place long among the lower orders,"
414,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and specimens of it, both in prose and verse, are found a century after"
415,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Conquest. Gradually the Norman tongue began to amalgamate with it,"
416,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and the result was, the English. At what precise year our language might"
417,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"be said to begin, it is impossible to determine. Throughout the whole of"
418,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the twelfth century, great changes were taking place in the grammatical"
419,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"construction, as well as in the substance of the Anglo-Saxon. Some new"
420,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"words were imported from the Norman, but, as Dr Johnson remarks, 'the"
421,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language was still more materially altered by the change of its sounds,"
422,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the cutting short of its syllables, and the softening down of its"
423,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"terminations, and inflections of words.' Somewhere between 1180 and"
424,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"1216, the majestic speech in which Shakspeare was to write 'Macbeth'"
425,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and 'King Lear,' Lord Bacon his 'Advancement of Learning,' Milton his"
426,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'Paradise Lost' and 'Areopagitica,' Burke his 'Reflections,' and Sir"
427,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Walter Scott the Waverley Novels, and whose rough, but manly accents"
428,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"were to be spoken by at least a hundred million tongues, commenced its"
429,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"career, and not since Homer,"
430,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
431,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"""on the Chian strand,"
432,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssee
433,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea,"""
434,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
435,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,had a nobler era been marked in the history of literature. For here was
436,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a tongue born which was destined to mate even with that of Greece in
437,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"richness and flexibility, to make the language of Cicero and Virgil seem"
438,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stiff and stilted in comparison, and, if not to vie with the French in"
439,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"airy grace, or with the Italian in liquid music, to excel them far in"
440,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,teeming resources and robust energy. Memorable and hallowed for ever be
441,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the hour when the 'well of English undefiled' first sparkled to the day!
442,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
443,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Previous to this the chief of the poets, after the Conquest, were"
444,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Normans. The country whence that people came had for some time been
445,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"celebrated for poetry. France was, as to its poetic literature, divided"
446,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,into two great sections--the Provençal and the Northern. The first was
447,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"like the country where it flourished--gay, flowery, and exuberant; it"
448,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"swam in romance, and its rhymers delighted, when addressing large"
449,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"audiences under the open skies of their delightful climate, to indulge"
450,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in compliment and fanfaronade, to sing of war, wine, and love."
451,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
452,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Normans produced a race of simpler poets. That some of them were men
453,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as well as singers, is proved by the fact that it was a bard named"
454,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Taillefer who first broke the English ranks at the battle of Hastings.
455,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"After him came Philippe de Thaun, who tried to set to song the science"
456,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of his day; Thorold, the author of a romance entitled 'Roland;' Samson"
457,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"de Nauteuil, the translator of Solomon's Proverbs into French verse;"
458,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Geoffrey Gaimar, who wrote a Chronicle of the Saxon kings; and one"
459,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"David, a minstrel of no little note and power in his day. But a more"
460,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"remarkable writer succeeded, and his work, like Aaron's rod, swallowed"
461,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"up all the productions of these clever but petty poets. This was Wace,"
462,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"commonly called Maistre Wace, a native of Jersey. In 1160, or as some"
463,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"say 1155, Wace finished his 'Brut d'Angleterre' which is in reality a"
464,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"translation into French of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote a History"
465,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of Britain from the imaginary Brutus of Troy down to Cadwallader in
466,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,689. Literature owes not a little to Wace's poem. He collected into
467,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a permanent shape a number of traditions and legends--many of them
468,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"interesting--which had been floating through Europe, just as Macpherson"
469,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"preserved in Ossian not a few real fragments of the songs of Selma. And,"
470,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as we shall see immediately, Wace's production became the basis of the"
471,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,earliest of English poems.
472,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
473,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Maistre Wace is the author also of a History of the Normans, which he"
474,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"calls 'Roman de Rou;' or, 'The Romance of Rollo.' He was a great favourite"
475,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"with Henry II., who bestowed on him a canonry in the Cathedral of Bayeux."
476,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Besides Wace, there flourished about the same time Benoit, who wrote a"
477,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"History of the Dukes of Normandy; and Guernes, a churchman of Pont St"
478,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Maxence in Picardy, who wrote in verse a Life of St Thomas à Becket."
479,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
480,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"At the beginning of the century following the Conquest, the chief authors,"
481,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"such as Peter of Blois, John of Salisbury, Joseph of Exeter, and Geoffrey"
482,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Monmouth, all wrote in Latin. Layamon, however, a priest of Ernesley-"
483,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"upon-Severn, used the vernacular in a poem which, as we have already"
484,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"hinted, was essentially a translation of Wace's 'Brut d'Angleterre.' The"
485,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,most remarkable thing about Layamon's poem is the language in which it is
486,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,written-language in which you catch English in the very act of chipping
487,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Saxon shell, or, as Campbell happily remarks, 'the style of Layamon is"
488,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,as nearly the intermediate state of the old and new languages as can be
489,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,found in any ancient specimen --something like the new insect stirring its
490,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,wings before it has shaken off the aurelia state.'
491,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
492,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Between Layamon and Robert of Gloucester a good many miscellaneous
493,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"strains--some of a satirical, others of an amatory, and others again of"
494,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a legendary and devout style--were produced. It was customary then for
495,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"minstrels, at the instance of the clergy, to sing on Sundays devotional"
496,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"strains on the harp to the assembled multitudes. At public entertainments,"
497,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"during week-days, gay ditties were common. One of these is extant, but"
498,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"is too coarse for quotation. It is entitled 'The Land of Cokayne,' an"
499,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"allegorical satire on the luxury and vice of the Church, given under the"
500,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"description of an imaginary paradise, in which the nuns are represented"
501,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as houris, and the black and grey monks as their paramours. 'Richard of"
502,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Alemaine' is a ballad, composed by an adherent of Simon de Montfort, Earl"
503,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Leicester, after the defeat of the Royal party at the battle of Lewes"
504,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in 1264. In the year after that battle the Royal cause rallied, and the"
505,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Earl of Warren and Sir Hugh Bigod returned from exile, and helped the King"
506,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in his victory. In the battle of Lewes, Richard, King of the Romans, his"
507,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"brother Henry III., and Prince Edward, with many others of the Royal"
508,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"party, were taken prisoners."
509,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"[Note: See 'Richard of Alemaine,' Percy's Reliques, vol. ii., p. 2.]"
510,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
511,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The spirit and the allusions of this song shew that it was composed by
512,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Leicester's party in the moment of their victory, and not after the"
513,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"reaction which took place against their cause, and it must therefore"
514,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"belong to the thirteenth century. To this period, too, probably belongs"
515,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a political satire, published by Ritson, and which Campbell thus charac-"
516,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"terises:--'It is a ballad on the execution of the Scottish patriots, Sir"
517,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,William Wallace and Sir Simon Frazer. The diction is as barbarous as we
518,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,should expect from a song of triumph on such a subject. It relates the
519,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,death and treatment of Wallace very minutely. The circumstance of his
520,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"being covered with a mock crown of laurel in Westminster Hall, which Stow"
521,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"repeats, is there mentioned, and that of his legs being fastened with iron"
522,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"fetters ""_under his horse's wombe_"" is told with savage exultation. The"
523,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,piece was probably indited in the very year of the political murders which
524,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"it celebrates, certainly before 1314, as it mentions the skulking of"
525,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Robert Bruce, which, after the battle of Bannockburn, must have become"
526,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a jest out of season.'
527,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
528,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Campbell quotes a love-ditty of this period, which is not devoid of"
529,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,merit:--
530,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
531,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'For her love I cark and cave,"
532,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For her love I droop and dare,"
533,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For her love my bliss is bare,"
534,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,And all I wax wan.
535,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
536,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'For her love in sleep I slake,[1]"
537,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For her love all night I wake,"
538,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,For her love mourning I make
539,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,More than any man.'
540,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
541,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,[1] 'In sleep I slake:' am deprived of sleep.
542,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
543,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
544,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,And another of a pastoral vein:--
545,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
546,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'When the nightingale singës the woods waxen green,"
547,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Leaf, grass, and blossom springs in Avril I ween,"
548,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"And love is to my heart gone, with one spear so keen,"
549,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Night and day my blood it drinks, my heart doth me teen.'"
550,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
551,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,About a hundred years after Layamon (in 1280) appeared a poet not
552,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"dissimilar to him, named Robert of Gloucester. His surname is unknown, and"
553,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,so are the particulars of his history. We know only that he was a monk of
554,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Gloucester Abbey, that he lived in the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I.,"
555,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and that he translated the Legends of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and continued"
556,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the History of England down to the time of Edward I. This work is wonder-
557,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"fully minute, and, generally speaking, accurate in its topography as well"
558,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as narrative, and was of service to Selden when he wrote his Notes to"
559,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Drayton's 'Polyolbion.' It is more valuable in this respect than as a
560,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,piece of imagination.
561,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
562,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,He narrates the grandest events--such as the first crusaders bursting
563,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"into Asia, with a sword of fire hung in the firmament before them, and"
564,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,beckoning them on their way--as coolly as he might the emigration of a
565,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"colony of ants. Yet, although there is little animation or poetry in his"
566,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"general manner, he usually succeeds in riveting the reader's attention;"
567,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and the speeches he puts into the mouths of his heroes glow with at
568,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,least rhetorical fire. And as a critic truly remarks--'Injustice to the
569,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"ancient versifier, we should remember that he had still only a rude"
570,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language to employ, the speech of boors and burghers, which, though it"
571,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"might possess a few songs and satires, could afford him no models of"
572,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,heroic narration. In such an age the first occupant passes uninspired
573,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,over subjects which might kindle the highest enthusiasm in the poet of
574,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a riper period, as the savage treads unconsciously in his deserts over"
575,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"mines of incalculable value, without sagacity to discover or inplements"
576,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,to explore them.' We give the following extracts from Robert of
577,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Gloucester's poem:--

1380,A BATTLE,"Davie was also the author of an original poem, entitled, 'Visions in"
1381,A BATTLE,"Verse,' and of the 'Battle of Jerusalem,' in which he versifies a French"
1382,A BATTLE,romance. In this production Pilate is represented as challenging our
1383,A BATTLE,Lord to single combat!
1384,A BATTLE,
1385,A BATTLE,"In 1349, died Richard Rollo, a hermit, and a verse-writer. He lived a"
1386,A BATTLE,"secluded life near the nunnery of Hampole in Yorkshire, and wrote a"
1387,A BATTLE,"number of devotional pieces, most of them very dull. In 1350, Lawrence"
1388,A BATTLE,Minot produced some short narrative ballads on the victories of Edward
1389,A BATTLE,"III., beginning with Halidon Hill, and ending with the siege of Guisnes"
1390,A BATTLE,Castle. His works lay till the end of the last century obscure in a MS.
1391,A BATTLE,"of the Cotton Collection, which was supposed to be a transcript of the"
1392,A BATTLE,Works of Chaucer. On a spare leaf of the MS. there had been accidentally
1393,A BATTLE,"written a name, probably that of its original possessor, 'Richard"
1394,A BATTLE,Chawsir.' This the getter-up of the Cotton catalogue imagined to be the
1395,A BATTLE,"name of Geoffrey Chaucer. Mr Tyrwhitt, while foraging for materials to"
1396,A BATTLE,"his edition of 'The Canterbury Tales,' accidentally found out who the"
1397,A BATTLE,"real writer was; and Ritson afterwards published Minot's ballads, which"
1398,A BATTLE,"are ten in number, written in the northern dialect, and in an alliterative"
1399,A BATTLE,"style, and with considerable spirit and liveliness. He has been called the"
1400,A BATTLE,Tyrtaeus of his age.
1401,A BATTLE,
1402,A BATTLE,We come now to the immediate predecessor of Chaucer--Robert Langlande.
1403,A BATTLE,"He was a secular priest, born at Mortimer's Cleobury, in Shropshire,"
1404,A BATTLE,"and educated at Oriel College, Oxford. He wrote, towards the end of the"
1405,A BATTLE,"fourteenth century, a very remarkable work, entitled, 'Visions of William"
1406,A BATTLE,concerning Piers Plowman.' The general object of this poem is to denounce
1407,A BATTLE,"the abuses of society, and to inculcate, upon both clergy and laity, their"
1408,A BATTLE,respective duties. One William is represented as falling asleep among the
1409,A BATTLE,"Malvern Hills, and sees in his dream a succession of visions, in which"
1410,A BATTLE,"great ingenuity, great boldness, and here and there a powerful vein of"
1411,A BATTLE,"poetry, are displayed. Truth is described as a magnificent tower, and"
1412,A BATTLE,"Falsehood as a deep dungeon. In one canto Religion descends, and gives"
1413,A BATTLE,a long harangue about what should be the conduct of society and of
1414,A BATTLE,"individuals. Bribery and Falsehood, in another part of the poem, seek a"
1415,A BATTLE,"marriage with each other, and make their way to the courts of justice,"
1416,A BATTLE,where they find many friends. Some very whimsical passages are introduced.
1417,A BATTLE,"The Power of Grace confers upon Piers Plowman, who stands for the"
1418,A BATTLE,"Christian Life, four stout oxen, to cultivate the field of Truth. These"
1419,A BATTLE,"are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the last of whom is described as the"
1420,A BATTLE,gentlest of the team. She afterwards assigns him the like number of stots
1421,A BATTLE,"or bullocks, to harrow what the evangelists had ploughed, and this new"
1422,A BATTLE,"horned team consists of Saint or Stot Ambrose, Stot Austin, Stot Gregory,"
1423,A BATTLE,and Stot Jerome.
1424,A BATTLE,
1425,A BATTLE,"Apart from its fantastic structure, 'Piers Plowman' was not only a sign"
1426,A BATTLE,"of the times, but did great service in its day. His voice rings like"
1427,A BATTLE,that of Israel's minor prophets--like Nahum or Hosea--in a dark and
1428,A BATTLE,"corrupt age. He proclaims liberal and independent sentiments, he attacks"
1429,A BATTLE,"slavery and superstition, and he predicts the doom of the Papacy as with"
1430,A BATTLE,a thunder-knell. Chaucer must have felt roused to his share of the
1431,A BATTLE,reformatory work by the success of 'Piers Plowman;' Spenser is suspected
1432,A BATTLE,"to have read and borrowed from him; and even Milton, in his description"
1433,A BATTLE,"of a lazar-house in 'Paradise Lost,' had him probably in his eye. (See"
1434,A BATTLE,our last extract from 'Piers.')

2066,ADVERTISEMENT.,
2067,ADVERTISEMENT.,On a further examination of the material for 'Specimens and Memoirs of the
2068,ADVERTISEMENT.,"less-known British Poets,' it has been deemed advisable to devote three"
2069,ADVERTISEMENT.,"volumes to this _résumé_, and merely to give extracts from Cowley, instead"
2070,ADVERTISEMENT.,of following out the arrangement proposed when the issue for this year was
2071,ADVERTISEMENT.,announced. In this space it has been found possible to present the reader
2072,ADVERTISEMENT.,with specimens of almost all those authors whose writings were at any
2073,ADVERTISEMENT.,"period esteemed. The series will thus be rendered more perfect, and will"
2074,ADVERTISEMENT.,include the complete works of the authors whose entire writings are by
2075,ADVERTISEMENT.,a general verdict regarded as worthy of preservation; together with
2076,ADVERTISEMENT.,"representations of the style, and brief notices of the poets who have,"
2077,ADVERTISEMENT.,"during the progress of our literature, occupied a certain rank, but whose"
2078,ADVERTISEMENT.,popularity and importance have in a great measure passed.

2080,ADVERTISEMENT.,It is confidently hoped that the arrangements now made will give a
2081,ADVERTISEMENT.,completeness to the First Division of the Library Edition of the British
2082,ADVERTISEMENT.,Poets--from Chaucer to Cowper--which will be acceptable and satisfactory

2319,JOHN GOWER,
2320,JOHN GOWER,
2321,JOHN GOWER,Very little is told us (as usual in the beginnings of a literature) of
2322,JOHN GOWER,"the life and private history of Gower, and that little is not specially"
2323,JOHN GOWER,authentic or clearly consistent with itself. His life consists mainly of
2324,JOHN GOWER,"a series of suppositions, with one or two firm facts between--like a few"
2325,JOHN GOWER,stepping-stones insulated in wide spaces of water. He is said to have
2326,JOHN GOWER,"been born about the year 1325, and if so must have been a few years"
2327,JOHN GOWER,"older than Chaucer; whom he, however, outlived. He was a friend as well"
2328,JOHN GOWER,"as contemporary of that great poet, who, in the fifth book of his"
2329,JOHN GOWER,"'Troilus and Cresseide,' thus addresses him:--"
2330,JOHN GOWER,
2331,JOHN GOWER,"'O moral Gower, this bookë I direct,"
2332,JOHN GOWER,"To thee and the philosophical Strood,"
2333,JOHN GOWER,"To vouchsafe where need is to correct,"
2334,JOHN GOWER,Of your benignities and zealës good.'
2335,JOHN GOWER,
2336,JOHN GOWER,"Gower, on the other hand, in his 'Confessio Amantis,' through the mouth"
2337,JOHN GOWER,"of Venus, speaks as follows of Chaucer:--"
2338,JOHN GOWER,
2339,JOHN GOWER,"'And greet well Chaucer when ye meet,"
2340,JOHN GOWER,As my disciple and my poët;
2341,JOHN GOWER,"For 'in the flower of his youth,"
2342,JOHN GOWER,"In sundry wise, as he well couth,"
2343,JOHN GOWER,"Of ditties and of songës glad,"
2344,JOHN GOWER,"The whichë for my sake he made,"
2345,JOHN GOWER,"The laud fulfill'd is over all,' &c."
2346,JOHN GOWER,
2347,JOHN GOWER,The place of Gower's birth has been the subject of much controversy.
2348,JOHN GOWER,"Caxton asserts that he was a native of Wales. Leland, Bales, Pits,"
2349,JOHN GOWER,"Hollingshed, and Edmondson contend, on the other hand, that he belonged"
2350,JOHN GOWER,"to the Statenham family, in Yorkshire. In proof of this, a deed is"
2351,JOHN GOWER,"appealed to, which is preserved among the ancient records of the Marquis"
2352,JOHN GOWER,"of Stafford. To this deed, of which the local date is Statenham, and the"
2353,JOHN GOWER,"chronological 1346, one of the subscribing witnesses is _John Gower_ who"
2354,JOHN GOWER,"on the back of the deed is stated, in the handwriting of at least a"
2355,JOHN GOWER,"century later, to be '_Sr John Gower the Poet_'. Whatever may be thought"
2356,JOHN GOWER,"of this piece of evidence, 'the proud tradition,' adds Todd, who had"
2357,JOHN GOWER,"produced it, 'in the Marquis of Stafford's family has been, and still"
2358,JOHN GOWER,"is, that the poet was of Statenham; and who would not consider the"
2359,JOHN GOWER,dignity of his genealogy augmented by enrolling among its worthies the
2360,JOHN GOWER,moral Gower?'
2361,JOHN GOWER,
2362,JOHN GOWER,"From his will we know that he possessed the manor of Southwell, in the"
2363,JOHN GOWER,"county of Nottingham, and that of Multon, in the county of Suffolk. He"
2364,JOHN GOWER,"was thus a rich man, as well as probably a knight. The latter fact is"
2365,JOHN GOWER,inferred from the circumstance of his effigies in the church of St Mary
2366,JOHN GOWER,"Overies wearing a chaplet of roses, such as, says Francis Thynne, 'the"
2367,JOHN GOWER,"knyghtes in old time used, either of gold or other embroiderye, made"
2368,JOHN GOWER,"after the fashion of roses, one of the peculiar ornamentes of a knighte,"
2369,JOHN GOWER,"as well as his collar of S.S.S., his guilte sword and spurres. Which"
2370,JOHN GOWER,"chaplett or circle of roses was as well attributed to knyghtes, the"
2371,JOHN GOWER,"lowest degree of honor, as to the higher degrees of duke, erle, &c.,"
2372,JOHN GOWER,"being knyghtes, for so I have seen John of Gaunte pictured in his"
2373,JOHN GOWER,"chaplett of roses; and King, Edwarde the Thirde gave his chaplett to"
2374,JOHN GOWER,"Eustace Rybamonte; only the difference was, that as they were of lower"
2375,JOHN GOWER,"degree, so had they fewer roses placed on their chaplett or cyrcle of"
2376,JOHN GOWER,"golde, one ornament deduced from the dukes crowne, which had the roses"
2377,JOHN GOWER,"upon the top of the cyrcle, when the knights had them only upon the"
2378,JOHN GOWER,cyrcle or garlande itself.'
2379,JOHN GOWER,
2380,JOHN GOWER,It has been said that Gower as well as Chaucer studied in the Temple.
2381,JOHN GOWER,"This, however, Thynne doubts, on the ground that 'it is most certeyn"
2382,JOHN GOWER,to be gathered by cyrcumstances of recordes that the lawyers were not
2383,JOHN GOWER,in the Temple until towardes the latter parte of the reygne of Kinge
2384,JOHN GOWER,"Edwarde the Thirde, at whiche tyme Chaucer was a grave manne, holden in"
2385,JOHN GOWER,"greate credyt and employed in embassye;' and when, of course, Gower,"
2386,JOHN GOWER,"being his senior, must have been 'graver' still."
2387,JOHN GOWER,
2388,JOHN GOWER,There is scarcely anything more to relate of the personal career of our
2389,JOHN GOWER,"poet. In his elder days he became attached to the House of Lancaster,"
2390,JOHN GOWER,"under Thomas of Woodstock, as Chaucer did under John of Gaunt. It is"
2391,JOHN GOWER,"said that the two poets, who had been warm friends, at last quarrelled,"
2392,JOHN GOWER,"but obscurity rests on the cause, the circumstances, the duration, and"
2393,JOHN GOWER,"the consequences of the dispute. Gower, like some far greater bards,"
2394,JOHN GOWER,"--Milton for instance, and those whom Milton has commemorated,"
2395,JOHN GOWER,
2396,JOHN GOWER,"'Blind Thamyris and blind Moeonides,"
2397,JOHN GOWER,"And Tiresiaa and Phineus, prophets old,'--"
2398,JOHN GOWER,
2399,JOHN GOWER,"was sometime ere his death deprived of his sight, as we know on his own"
2400,JOHN GOWER,"authority. It appears from his will that he was still living in 1408,"
2401,JOHN GOWER,having outlived Chaucer eight years. This will is a curious document.
2402,JOHN GOWER,"It is that of a very rich and very superstitious Catholic, who leaves"
2403,JOHN GOWER,"bequests to churches, hospitals, to priors, sub-priors, and priests,"
2404,JOHN GOWER,"with the significant request '_ut orent pro me_'--a request which, for"
2405,JOHN GOWER,"the sake of the poor soul of the 'moral Gower,' was we trust devoutly"
2406,JOHN GOWER,"obeyed, although we are irresistibly reminded of the old rhyme,"
2407,JOHN GOWER,
2408,JOHN GOWER,"'Pray for the soul of Gabriel John,"
2409,JOHN GOWER,Who died in the year one thousand and one;
2410,JOHN GOWER,"You may if you please, or let it alone,"
2411,JOHN GOWER,For it's all one
2412,JOHN GOWER,"To Gabriel John,"
2413,JOHN GOWER,Who died in the year one thousand and one.'
2414,JOHN GOWER,
2415,JOHN GOWER,"There is no mention of children in the will, and hence the assertion of"
2416,JOHN GOWER,"Edmondson, who, in his genealogical table of the Statenham family, says"
2417,JOHN GOWER,"that Thomas Gower, the governor of the castle of Mans in the times of"
2418,JOHN GOWER,"the Fifth and Sixth Henrys, was the only son of the poet, and that of"
2419,JOHN GOWER,"Glover, who, in his 'Visitation of Yorkshire,' describes Gower as"
2420,JOHN GOWER,"married to a lady named Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Sadbowrughe,"
2421,JOHN GOWER,"Baron of the Exchequer, by whom he had five sons and three daughters,"
2422,JOHN GOWER,"must both fall to the ground. According to the will, Gower's wife's name"
2423,JOHN GOWER,"was Agnes, and he leaves to her £100 in legacy, besides his valuable"
2424,JOHN GOWER,"goods and the rents accruing from his aforesaid manors of Multon, in"
2425,JOHN GOWER,"Suffolk, and Southwell, in Nottinghamshire. His body was, according"
2426,JOHN GOWER,"to his own direction, buried in the monastery of St Mary Overies, in"
2427,JOHN GOWER,"Southwark, (afterwards the church of St Saviour,) where a monument, and"
2428,JOHN GOWER,"an effigies, too, were erected, with the roses of a knight girdling the"
2429,JOHN GOWER,"brow of one who was unquestionably a true, if not a great poet."
2430,JOHN GOWER,
2431,JOHN GOWER,"In Warton's 'History of English Poetry,' and in the 'Illustrations of"
2432,JOHN GOWER,"the Lives and Writings of Gower and Chaucer' by Mr Todd, there will be"
2433,JOHN GOWER,"found ample and curious details about MS. poems by Gower, such as fifty"
2434,JOHN GOWER,"sonnets in French; a 'Panegyrick on Henry IV.,' half in Latin and half"
2435,JOHN GOWER,"in English, a short elegiac poem on the same subject, &c.; besides a"
2436,JOHN GOWER,"large work, entitled 'Speculum Meditantis,' a poem in French of a moral"
2437,JOHN GOWER,"cast; and 'Vox Clamantis,' consisting of seven books of Latin elegiacs,"
2438,JOHN GOWER,and chiefly filled with a metrical account of the insurrections of the
2439,JOHN GOWER,Commons in the reign of Richard II. In the dedication of this latter
2440,JOHN GOWER,"work to Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, Gower speaks of his blindness"
2441,JOHN GOWER,"and his age. He says, 'Hanc epistolam subscriptam corde devoto misit"
2442,JOHN GOWER,_senex et cecus_ Johannes Gower reverendissimo in Christo patri ac
2443,JOHN GOWER,"domino suo precipuo domino Thome de Arundell, Cantuar. Archiepö.' &c."
2444,JOHN GOWER,"Warton proves that the 'Vox Clamantis' was written in the year 1397, by"
2445,JOHN GOWER,"a line in the Bodleian manuscript of the poem, 'Hos ego _bis deno_"
2446,JOHN GOWER,"Ricardo regis in anno.' Richard II. began, it is well known, to reign in"
2447,JOHN GOWER,"the year 1377, when ten years of age, and, of course, the year 1397 was"
2448,JOHN GOWER,"the twentieth of his reign. It follows from this, that for eleven years"
2449,JOHN GOWER,"at least before his death Gower had been _senex et cecus_, helpless"
2450,JOHN GOWER,through old age and blindness.
2451,JOHN GOWER,
2452,JOHN GOWER,The 'Confessio Amantis' is the only work of Gower's which is printed and
2453,JOHN GOWER,in English. The rest are still slumbering in MS.; and even although the
2454,JOHN GOWER,'Vox Clamantis' should put in a sleepy plea for the resurrection of
2455,JOHN GOWER,"print, on the whole we are disposed to say, better for all parties that"
2456,JOHN GOWER,it and the rest should slumber on. But the 'Confessio Amantis' is
2457,JOHN GOWER,altogether a remarkable production. It is said to have been written at
2458,JOHN GOWER,"the command of Richard II., who, meeting our poet rowing on the Thames,"
2459,JOHN GOWER,"near London, took him on board the royal barge, and requested him to"
2460,JOHN GOWER,"_book some new thing_. It is an English poem, in eight books, and was"
2461,JOHN GOWER,"first printed by Caxton in the year 1483. The 'Speculum Meditantis,'"
2462,JOHN GOWER,"'Vox Clamantis,' and 'Confessio Amantis,' are, properly speaking, parts"
2463,JOHN GOWER,"of one great work, and are represented by three volumes upon Gower's"
2464,JOHN GOWER,curious tomb in the old conventual church of St Mary Overies already
2465,JOHN GOWER,"alluded to--a church, by the way, which the poet himself assisted in"
2466,JOHN GOWER,rebuilding in the elegant shape which it retains to this day.
2467,JOHN GOWER,
2468,JOHN GOWER,"The 'Confessio' is a large unwieldy collection of poetry and prose,"
2469,JOHN GOWER,"superstition and science, love and religion, allegory and historical"
2470,JOHN GOWER,"facts. It is crammed with all varieties of learning, and a perverse but"
2471,JOHN GOWER,infinite ingenuity is shewn in the arrangement of its heterogeneous
2472,JOHN GOWER,materials. In one book the whole mysteries of the Hermetic philosophy
2473,JOHN GOWER,"are expounded, and the wonders of alchymy dazzle us in every page."
2474,JOHN GOWER,"In another, the poet scales the heights and sounds the depths of"
2475,JOHN GOWER,Aristotelianism. From this we have extracted in the 'Specimens' a
2476,JOHN GOWER,"glowing account of 'The Chariot of the Sun.' Throughout the work, tales"
2477,JOHN GOWER,and stories of every description and degree of merit are interspersed.
2478,JOHN GOWER,"These are principally derived from an old book called 'Pantheon; or,"
2479,JOHN GOWER,"Memoriae Seculorum,'--a kind of universal history, more studious of"
2480,JOHN GOWER,"effect than accuracy, in which the author ranges over the whole history"
2481,JOHN GOWER,"of the world, from the creation down to the year 1186. This was a"
2482,JOHN GOWER,"specimen of a kind of writing in which the Middle Ages abounded--namely,"
2483,JOHN GOWER,"chronicles, which gradually superseded the monkish legends, and for"
2484,JOHN GOWER,a time eclipsed the classics themselves; a kind of writing hovering
2485,JOHN GOWER,"between history and fiction, embracing the widest sweep, written in a"
2486,JOHN GOWER,"barbarous style, and swarming with falsehoods; but exciting, interesting,"
2487,JOHN GOWER,"and often instructive, and tending to kindle curiosity, and"
2488,JOHN GOWER,create in the minds of their readers a love for literature.
2489,JOHN GOWER,
2490,JOHN GOWER,"Besides chronicles, Gower had read many romances, and alludes to them"
2491,JOHN GOWER,in various parts of his works. His 'Confessio Amantis' was apparently
2492,JOHN GOWER,"written after Chaucer's 'Troilus and Cresseide,' and after 'The Flower"
2493,JOHN GOWER,"and the Leaf,' inasmuch as he speaks of the one and imitates the other"
2494,JOHN GOWER,"in that poem. That Chaucer had not, however, yet composed his 'Testament"
2495,JOHN GOWER,"of Love,' appears from the epilogue to the 'Confessio,' where Gower is"
2496,JOHN GOWER,"ordered by Venus, who expresses admiration of Chaucer for the early"
2497,JOHN GOWER,"devotion of his muse to her service, to say to him at the close--"
2498,JOHN GOWER,
2499,JOHN GOWER,"'Forthy, now in his daies old,"
2500,JOHN GOWER,"Thou shalt him tell this message,"
2501,JOHN GOWER,That he upon his later age
2502,JOHN GOWER,"To set an end of all his work,"
2503,JOHN GOWER,"As he which is mine owen clerk,"
2504,JOHN GOWER,"Do make his Testament of Love,"
2505,JOHN GOWER,"As thou hast done thy shrift above,"
2506,JOHN GOWER,So that my court it may record'--
2507,JOHN GOWER,
2508,JOHN GOWER,the 'shrift' being of course the 'Confessio Amantis.' In 'The Canterbury
2509,JOHN GOWER,Tales' there are several indications that Chaucer was indebted to Gower
2510,JOHN GOWER,"--'The Man of Law's Tale' being borrowed from Gower's 'Constantia,' and"
2511,JOHN GOWER,'The Wife of Bath's Tale' being founded on Gower's 'Florent.'
2512,JOHN GOWER,
2513,JOHN GOWER,"After all, Gower cannot be classed with the greater bards. He sparkles"
2514,JOHN GOWER,brightly chiefly from the depth of the darkness through which he shines.
2515,JOHN GOWER,"He is more remarkable for extent than for depth, for solidity than for"
2516,JOHN GOWER,"splendour, for fuel than for fire, for learning than for genius."

2841,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2842,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2843,JOHN BARBOUR.,The facts known about this Scottish poet are only the following. He
2844,JOHN BARBOUR.,"seems to have been born about the year 1316, in, probably, the city of"
2845,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen. This is stated by Hume of Godscroft, by Dr Mackenzie, and"
2846,JOHN BARBOUR.,"others, but is not thoroughly authenticated. Some think he was the son"
2847,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of one Andrew Barbour, who possessed a tenement in Castle Street,"
2848,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen; and others, that he was related to one Robert Barbour, who, in"
2849,JOHN BARBOUR.,"1309, received a charter of the lands of Craigie, in Forfarshire, from"
2850,JOHN BARBOUR.,"King Robert the Bruce. These, however, are mere conjectures, founded"
2851,JOHN BARBOUR.,"upon a similarity of name. It is clear, from Barbour's after rank in"
2852,JOHN BARBOUR.,"the Church, that he had received a learned education, but whether in"
2853,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Arbroath or Aberdeen is uncertain. We know, however, that a school of"
2854,JOHN BARBOUR.,divinity and canon law had existed at Aberdeen since the reign of
2855,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Alexander II., and it is conjectured that Barbour first studied there,"
2856,JOHN BARBOUR.,"and then at Oxford. In the year 1357, he was undoubtedly Archdeacon of"
2857,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen, since we find him, under this title, nominated by the Bishop"
2858,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of that diocese, one of the Commissioners appointed to meet in Edinburgh"
2859,JOHN BARBOUR.,"to take measures to liberate King David, who had been captured at the"
2860,JOHN BARBOUR.,"battle of Nevil's Cross, and detained from that date in England. It"
2861,JOHN BARBOUR.,"seems evident, from the customs of the Roman Catholic Church, that he"
2862,JOHN BARBOUR.,"must have been at least forty when he was created Archdeacon, and this"
2863,JOHN BARBOUR.,is a good reason for fixing his birth in the year 1316.
2864,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2865,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In the same year, Barbour obtained permission from Edward III., at the"
2866,JOHN BARBOUR.,"request of the Scottish King, to travel through England with three"
2867,JOHN BARBOUR.,"scholars who were to study at Oxford, probably at Balliol College, which"
2868,JOHN BARBOUR.,"had, a hundred years nearly before, been founded and endowed by the wife"
2869,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of the famous John Balliol of Scotland. Some years afterwards, in"
2870,JOHN BARBOUR.,"November 1364, he got permission to pass, accompanied by four horsemen,"
2871,JOHN BARBOUR.,"through England, to pursue his studies at the same renowned university."
2872,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In the year 1365, we find another casual notice of our Scottish bard. A"
2873,JOHN BARBOUR.,passport has been found giving him permission from the King of England
2874,JOHN BARBOUR.,"to travel, in company with six horsemen, through that country on their"
2875,JOHN BARBOUR.,"way to St Denis', and other sacred places. It is evident that this was"
2876,JOHN BARBOUR.,a religious pilgrimage on the part of Barbour and his companions.

2878,JOHN BARBOUR.,"A most peripatetic poet; verily, he must have been; for we find another"
2879,JOHN BARBOUR.,"safe-conduct, dated November 1368, granted by Edward to Barbour,"
2880,JOHN BARBOUR.,"permitting him, to pass through England, with two servants and their"
2881,JOHN BARBOUR.,"horses, on his way to France, for the purpose of pursuing his studies"
2882,JOHN BARBOUR.,there. Dr Jamieson (see his 'Life of Barbour') discovers the poet's name
2883,JOHN BARBOUR.,in the list of Auditors of the Exchequer.
2884,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2885,JOHN BARBOUR.,Barbour has himself told us that he commenced his poem in the 'yer of
2886,JOHN BARBOUR.,"grace, a thousand thre hundyr sevynty and five,' when, of course, he"
2887,JOHN BARBOUR.,"was in his sixtieth year, or, as he says, 'off hys eld sexty.' It is"
2888,JOHN BARBOUR.,supposed that David II.--who died in 1370--had urged Barbour to engage
2889,JOHN BARBOUR.,"in the work, which was not, however, completed till the fifth year of"
2890,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his successor, Robert II., who gave our poet a pension on account of it."
2891,JOHN BARBOUR.,This consisted of a sum of ten pounds Scots from the revenues of the
2892,JOHN BARBOUR.,"city of Aberdeen, and twenty shillings from the burgh mails. Mr James"
2893,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce, to whose interesting Life of Barbour, in his 'Eminent Men of"
2894,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen,' we are indebted for many of the facts in this narrative,"
2895,JOHN BARBOUR.,"says, 'The latter of these sums was granted to him, not merely during"
2896,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his own life, but to his assignees; and the Archdeacon bequeathed it to"
2897,JOHN BARBOUR.,"the dean, canons, the chapter, and other ministers of the Cathedral of"
2898,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen, on condition that they should for ever celebrate a yearly mass"
2899,JOHN BARBOUR.,"for his soul. At the Reformation, when it came to be discovered that"
2900,JOHN BARBOUR.,"masses did no good to souls in the other world, it is probable that this"
2901,JOHN BARBOUR.,endowment reverted to the Crown.'
2902,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2903,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Barbour also wrote a poem under what seems now the strange title, 'The"
2904,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Brute.' This was in reality a metrical history of Scotland, commencing"
2905,JOHN BARBOUR.,"with the fables concerning Brutus, or 'Brute,' who, according to ancient"
2906,JOHN BARBOUR.,"legends, was the great-grandson of Aeneas--came over from Italy, the"
2907,JOHN BARBOUR.,"land of his birth--landed at Totness, in Devonshire--destroyed the"
2908,JOHN BARBOUR.,giants who then inhabited Albion--called the island 'Britain' from his
2909,JOHN BARBOUR.,"own name, and became its first monarch. From this original fable,"
2910,JOHN BARBOUR.,Barbour is supposed to have wandered on through a hundred succeeding
2911,JOHN BARBOUR.,"stories of similar value, till he came down to his own day. There can be"
2912,JOHN BARBOUR.,"little regret felt, therefore, that the book is totally lost. Wynton, in"
2913,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his 'Chronicle,' refers to it in commendatory terms; but it cannot be"
2914,JOHN BARBOUR.,ascertained from his notices whether it was composed in Scotch or in
2915,JOHN BARBOUR.,Latin.
2916,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2917,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Barbour died about the beginning of the year 1396, eighty years of age."
2918,JOHN BARBOUR.,Lord Hailes ascertained the time of his death from the Chartulary of
2919,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen, where, under the date of 10th August 1398, mention is made of"
2920,JOHN BARBOUR.,"'quondam Joh. Barber, Archidiaconus, Aberd., and where it is said that"
2921,JOHN BARBOUR.,"he had died two years and a half before, namely, in 1396.'"
2922,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2923,JOHN BARBOUR.,"His great work, 'The Bruce,' or more fully, 'The History of Robert"
2924,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce, King of the Scots,' does not appear to have been printed till"
2925,JOHN BARBOUR.,"1616 in Edinburgh. Between that date and the year 1790, when Pinkerton's"
2926,JOHN BARBOUR.,"edition appeared, no less than twenty impressions were published, (the"
2927,JOHN BARBOUR.,"principal being those of Edinburgh in 1620 and 1648; Glasgow, 1665; and"
2928,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Edinburgh, 1670--all in black letter,) so popular immediately became the"
2929,JOHN BARBOUR.,"poem. Pinkerton's edition is in three volumes, and has a preface, notes,"
2930,JOHN BARBOUR.,"and a glossary, all of considerable value. The MS. was copied from a"
2931,JOHN BARBOUR.,"volume in the Advocates' Library, of the date of 1489, which was in the"
2932,JOHN BARBOUR.,"handwriting of one John Ramsay, believed to have been the prior of a"
2933,JOHN BARBOUR.,Carthusian monastery near Perth. Pinkerton first divided 'The Bruce'
2934,JOHN BARBOUR.,"into books. It had previously, like the long works of Naerius and"
2935,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Ennius, the earliest Roman poets, consisted of one entire piece, woven"
2936,JOHN BARBOUR.,"'from the top to the bottom without seam,' like the ancient simple"
2937,JOHN BARBOUR.,"garments in Jewry. The late respectable and very learned Dr Jamieson, of"
2938,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Nicolson Street United Secession Church, Edinburgh, well known as the"
2939,JOHN BARBOUR.,"author of the 'Scottish Dictionary,' 'Hermes Scythicus,' &c., published,"
2940,JOHN BARBOUR.,"in 1820, a more accurate edition of 'The Bruce,' along with Blind"
2941,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Harry's 'Wallace,' in two quarto volumes."
2942,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2943,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In strict chronology Barbour belongs to an earlier date than Chaucer,"
2944,JOHN BARBOUR.,having been born and having died a few years before him. But as the
2945,JOHN BARBOUR.,"first Scotch poet who has written anything of length, with the exception"
2946,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of the author of the 'Romance of Sir Tristrem,' he claims a conspicuous"
2947,JOHN BARBOUR.,place in our 'Specimens.' He was singularly fortunate in the choice of
2948,JOHN BARBOUR.,"a subject. With the exception of Wallace, there is no name in Scottish"
2949,JOHN BARBOUR.,history that even yet calls up prouder associations than that of Robert
2950,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce. The incidents in his history,--the escape he made from English"
2951,JOHN BARBOUR.,bondage to rescue his country from the same yoke; his rise refulgent
2952,JOHN BARBOUR.,"from the stroke which, in the cloisters of the Gray Friars, Dumfries,"
2953,JOHN BARBOUR.,laid the Red Comyn low; his daring to be crowned at Scone; his frequent
2954,JOHN BARBOUR.,"defeats; his lion-like retreat to the Hebrides, accompanied by one or"
2955,JOHN BARBOUR.,"two friends, his wife meanwhile having been carried captive, three of"
2956,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his brothers hanged, and himself supposed to be dead; the romantic"
2957,JOHN BARBOUR.,"perils he survived, and the victories he gained amidst the mountains"
2958,JOHN BARBOUR.,"where the deep waters of the river Awe are still telling of his name,"
2959,JOHN BARBOUR.,and the echoes of Ben Cruachan repeating the immortal sound; his sudden
2960,JOHN BARBOUR.,"reappearance on the west coast of Scotland, where, as he 'shook his"
2961,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Carrick spear,' his country rose, kindling around him like heather on"
2962,JOHN BARBOUR.,flame; the awful suspense of the hour when it was announced that Edward
2963,JOHN BARBOUR.,"I., the tyrant of the Ragman's Roll, the murderer of Wallace, was"
2964,JOHN BARBOUR.,approaching with a mighty army to crush the revolt; the electrifying
2965,JOHN BARBOUR.,"news that he had died at Sark, as if struck by the breath of the fatal"
2966,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Border, which he had reached, but could not overpass; the bloody"
2967,JOHN BARBOUR.,"summer's day of Bannockburn, in which Edward II. was repelled, and the"
2968,JOHN BARBOUR.,gallant army of his father annihilated; the energy and wisdom of the
2969,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce's civil administration after the victory; the less famous, but"
2970,JOHN BARBOUR.,"noble battle of Byland, nine years after Bannockburn, in which he again"
2971,JOHN BARBOUR.,smote the foes of his country; and the recognition which at last he
2972,JOHN BARBOUR.,"procured, on the accession of Edward III., of the independence of"
2973,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Scotland in 1329, himself dying the same year, his work done and his"
2974,JOHN BARBOUR.,"glory for ever secured,--not to speak of the beautiful legends which"
2975,JOHN BARBOUR.,have clustered round his history like ivy round an ancestral tower--of
2976,JOHN BARBOUR.,"the spider on the wall, teaching him the lesson of perseverance, as he"
2977,JOHN BARBOUR.,lay in the barn sad and desponding in heart--of the strange signal-light
2978,JOHN BARBOUR.,"upon the shore near his maternal castle of Turnberry, which led him to"
2979,JOHN BARBOUR.,"land, while"
2980,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2981,JOHN BARBOUR.,"'Dark red the heaven above it glow'd,"
2982,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Dark red the sea beneath it flow'd,"
2983,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Red rose the rocks on ocean's brim,"
2984,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In blood-red light her islets swim,"
2985,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Wild screams the dazzled sea-fowl gave,"
2986,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Dropp'd from their crags a plashing wave,"
2987,JOHN BARBOUR.,"The deer to distant covert drew,"
2988,JOHN BARBOUR.,"The blackcock deem'd it day, and crew;'"
2989,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2990,JOHN BARBOUR.,"and last, not least, the adventures of his gallant, unquenchable heart,"
2991,JOHN BARBOUR.,"when, in the hand of Douglas,--meet casket for such a gem!--it marched"
2992,JOHN BARBOUR.,"onwards, as it was wont to do, in conquering power, toward the Holy"
2993,JOHN BARBOUR.,Land;--all this has woven a garland round the brow of Bruce which every
2994,JOHN BARBOUR.,"civilised nation has delighted to honour, and given him besides a share"
2995,JOHN BARBOUR.,"in the affections and the pride of his own land, with the joy of which"
2996,JOHN BARBOUR.,'no stranger can intermeddle.'
2997,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2998,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce has been fortunate in his laureates, consisting of three of"
2999,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Scotland's greatest poets,--Barbour, Scott, and Burns. The last of these"
3000,JOHN BARBOUR.,"has given us a glimpse of the patriot-king, revealing him on the brow of"
3001,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bannockburn as by a single flash of lightning. The second has, in 'The"
3002,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Lord of the Isles,' seized and sung a few of the more romantic passages"
3003,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of his history. But Barbour has, with unwearied fidelity and no small"
3004,JOHN BARBOUR.,"force, described the whole incidents of Bruce's career, and reared to"
3005,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his memory, not an insulated column, but a broad and deep-set temple of"
3006,JOHN BARBOUR.,poetry.
3007,JOHN BARBOUR.,
3008,JOHN BARBOUR.,Barbour's poem has always been admired for its strict accuracy of
3009,JOHN BARBOUR.,"statement, to which Bower, Wynton, Hailes, Pinkerton, Jamieson, and Sir"
3010,JOHN BARBOUR.,Walter Scott all bear testimony; for the picturesque force of its
3011,JOHN BARBOUR.,"natural descriptions; for its insight into character, and the lifelike"
3012,JOHN BARBOUR.,spirit of its individual sketches; for the martial vigour of its battle-
3013,JOHN BARBOUR.,"pictures; for the enthusiasm which he feels, and makes his reader feel,"
3014,JOHN BARBOUR.,"for the valiant and wise, the sagacious and persevering, the bold,"
3015,JOHN BARBOUR.,"merciful, and religious character of its hero, and for the piety which"
3016,JOHN BARBOUR.,"pervades it, and proves that the author was not merely a churchman in"
3017,JOHN BARBOUR.,"profession, but a Christian at heart. Its defects of rude rhythm,"
3018,JOHN BARBOUR.,"irregular constructions, and obsolete phraseology, are those of its age;"
3019,JOHN BARBOUR.,"but its beauties, its unflagging interest, and its fine poetic spirit,"
3020,JOHN BARBOUR.,are characteristic of the writer's own genius.

3144,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"This author, who was prior of St Serf's monastery in Loch Leven, is the"
3145,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,author of what he calls 'An Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland.' It appeared
3146,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,about the year 1420. It is much inferior to the work of Barbour in
3147,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"poetry, but is full of historical information, anecdote, and legend. The"
3148,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,language is often sufficiently prosaic. Thus the poet begins to describe
3149,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"the return of King David II. from his captivity, referred to above."
3150,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,

3160,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"Contemporary, or nearly so, with Wyntoun were several other Scottish"

3162,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"designated of the 'Awle Ryall,' or of the Royal Hall or Palace, and that"
3163,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"he wrote a metrical romance, of which two cantos remain, called 'The"
3164,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"Gest of Arthur;' and another, named Clerk of Tranent, the author of a"
3165,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"romance, entitled 'The Adventures of Sir Gawain.' Of this latter also"
3166,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,two cantos only are extant. Although not perhaps deserving to have even
3167,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"portions of them extracted, they contain a good deal of poetry. A"
3168,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"person, too, of the name of Holland, about whose history we have no"
3169,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"information, produced a satirical poem, called 'The Howlate,' written in"

3179,BLIND HARRY.,Although there are diversities of opinion as to the exact time when this
3180,BLIND HARRY.,"blind minstrel flourished, we prefer alluding to him at this point,"
3181,BLIND HARRY.,"where he stands in close proximity to Barbour, the author of a poem on"
3182,BLIND HARRY.,a subject so cognate to 'Wallace' as 'Bruce.' Nothing is known of Harry
3183,BLIND HARRY.,"but that he was blind from infancy, that he composed this poem, and"
3184,BLIND HARRY.,gained a subsistence by reciting or singing portions of it through the
3185,BLIND HARRY.,"country. Another Wandering Willie, (see 'Redgauntlet,') he 'passed like"
3186,BLIND HARRY.,"night from land to land,' led by his own instincts, and wherever he met"
3187,BLIND HARRY.,"with a congenial audience, he proceeded to chant portions of the noble"
3188,BLIND HARRY.,"knight's achievements, his eyes the while twinkling, through their sad"
3189,BLIND HARRY.,"setting of darkness, with enthusiasm, and often suffused with tears."
3190,BLIND HARRY.,In some minds the conception of this blind wandering bard may awaken
3191,BLIND HARRY.,"ludicrous emotions, but to us it suggests a certain sublimity. Blind"
3192,BLIND HARRY.,Harry has powerfully described Wallace standing in the light and

3195,BLIND HARRY.,"light of the ghost of Wallace, and it ministers to him, not terror, but"
3196,BLIND HARRY.,"inspiration. Entering a cot at night, and asked for a tale, he begins,"
3197,BLIND HARRY.,"in low tones, to recite that frightful apparition at Gaskhall, and the"
3198,BLIND HARRY.,aged men and the crones vie with the children in drawing near the 'ingle

3211,BLIND HARRY.,High in the sphere the signs he made declare.

3214,BLIND HARRY.,
3215,BLIND HARRY.,and the simple villagers wonder at hearing these images from one who is
3216,BLIND HARRY.,"blind, not seeing the sun. As the leaves are rustling down from the"
3217,BLIND HARRY.,"ruddy trees of late autumn, he sings to a little circle of wayside"

3231,BLIND HARRY.,"and about to set as if for ever, then is the Minstrel's voice heard"

3233,BLIND HARRY.,went down while it was yet day.

3238,BLIND HARRY.,With a bauld sprite guid Wallace blent about.'
3239,BLIND HARRY.,
3240,BLIND HARRY.,"There can be little doubt that Blind Harry, during his lifetime, became"
3241,BLIND HARRY.,"a favourite, nay, a power in the realm. Wherever he circulated, there"
3242,BLIND HARRY.,"circulated the fame of Wallace; there, his deeds were recounted; there,"
3243,BLIND HARRY.,"hatred of a foreign foe, and love to their native land, were inculcated"
3244,BLIND HARRY.,as first principles; and long after the Homer of Scotland had breathed
3245,BLIND HARRY.,"his last, and been consigned perhaps to some little kirkyard among the"
3246,BLIND HARRY.,"uplands, his lays continued to live; and we know that such a man as"
3247,BLIND HARRY.,Burns (who read them in the modern paraphrase of William Hamilton of
3248,BLIND HARRY.,"Gilbertfield, a book which was, till within a somewhat recent period,"
3249,BLIND HARRY.,a household god in the libraries of the Scotch) derived from the old
3250,BLIND HARRY.,singer much of 'that national prejudice which boiled in his breast till
3251,BLIND HARRY.,"the floodgates of life shut in eternal rest.' If Barbour, as we said,"
3252,BLIND HARRY.,"was fortunate in his subject, still more was Blind Harry in his. The"
3253,BLIND HARRY.,interest felt in Wallace is of a deeper and warmer kind than that which
3254,BLIND HARRY.,we feel in Bruce. Bruce was of royal blood; Wallace was from an ancient
3255,BLIND HARRY.,but not wealthy family. Bruce stained his career by one great crime
3256,BLIND HARRY.,"--great in itself, but greater from the peculiar notions of the age"
3257,BLIND HARRY.,--the murder of Comyn in the sanctuary of Dumfries; on the character of
3258,BLIND HARRY.,Wallace no similar imputation rests. Wallace initiated that plan of
3259,BLIND HARRY.,"guerilla warfare,--that fighting now on foot and now on the wing, now"
3260,BLIND HARRY.,"with beak and now with talons, now with horns and now with hoofs,--which"
3261,BLIND HARRY.,"Bruce had only to perfect. Wallace was unsuccessful, and was besides"
3262,BLIND HARRY.,treated by the King of England with revolting barbarity; while Bruce
3263,BLIND HARRY.,"became victorious: and, as we saw in our remarks on Chaucer, it is the"
3264,BLIND HARRY.,unfortunate brave who stamp themselves most forcibly on a nation's
3265,BLIND HARRY.,"heart, and it is the red letters, which tell of suffering and death,"
3266,BLIND HARRY.,which are with most difficulty erased from a nation's tablets. On Bruce
3267,BLIND HARRY.,"we look somewhat as we regard Washington,--a great, serene man, who,"
3268,BLIND HARRY.,"after long reverses, nobly sustained, gained a notable national triumph;"
3269,BLIND HARRY.,"to Wallace we feel, as the Italians do to Garibaldi, as a demon of"
3270,BLIND HARRY.,"warlike power,--blending courage and clemency, enthusiasm and skill,"
3271,BLIND HARRY.,"daring and determination, in proportions almost superhuman,--and we cry"
3272,BLIND HARRY.,"with the poet,"
3273,BLIND HARRY.,
3274,BLIND HARRY.,"'The sword that seem'd fit for archangel to wield,"
3275,BLIND HARRY.,Was light in his terrible hand.'
3276,BLIND HARRY.,
3277,BLIND HARRY.,"We have often regretted that Sir Walter Scott, who, after all, has not"
3278,BLIND HARRY.,done full justice to Bruce in that very unequal and incondite poem 'The
3279,BLIND HARRY.,"Lord of the Isles,' had not bent his strength upon the Ulysses bow of"
3280,BLIND HARRY.,"Wallace, and filled up that splendid sketch of a part of his history to"
3281,BLIND HARRY.,"be found near the beginning of 'The Fair Maid of Perth.' As it is, after"
3282,BLIND HARRY.,"all that a number of respectable writers, such as Miss Porter, Mrs"
3283,BLIND HARRY.,"Hemans, Findlay, the late Mr Macpherson of Glasgow, and others, have"
3284,BLIND HARRY.,"done--in prose or verse, in the novel, the poem, or the drama--to"
3285,BLIND HARRY.,"illustrate the character and career of the Scottish hero, Blind Harry"
3286,BLIND HARRY.,remains his poet.
3287,BLIND HARRY.,
3288,BLIND HARRY.,"It is necessary to notice that Harry derived, by his own account, many"
3289,BLIND HARRY.,"of the facts of his narrative from a work by John Blair, a Benedictine"
3290,BLIND HARRY.,"monk from Dundee, who acted as Wallace's chaplain, and seems to have"
3291,BLIND HARRY.,"composed a life of him in Latin, which is lost. Besides these, he"
3292,BLIND HARRY.,"doubtless mingled in the story a number of traditions--some true, and"
3293,BLIND HARRY.,some false--which he found floating through the country. His authority
3294,BLIND HARRY.,"in reference to certain disputed matters, such as Wallace's journey to"
3295,BLIND HARRY.,"France, and his capture of the Red Rover, Thomas de Longueville, who"
3296,BLIND HARRY.,"became his fast friend and fellow-soldier, was not long ago entirely"
3297,BLIND HARRY.,established by certain important documents brought to light by the
3298,BLIND HARRY.,Maitland Club. It is probable that some other of his supposed
3299,BLIND HARRY.,misstatements--always excepting his ghost-stories--may yet receive from
3300,BLIND HARRY.,"future researches the confirmation they as yet want. Blind Harry, living"
3301,BLIND HARRY.,"about a century and a half after the era of Wallace, and at a time when"
3302,BLIND HARRY.,"tradition was the chief literature, was not likely to be able to test"
3303,BLIND HARRY.,the evidence of many of the circumstances which he narrated; but he
3304,BLIND HARRY.,"seems to speak in good faith: and, after all, what Paley says is"
3305,BLIND HARRY.,unquestionably true as a general principle--'Men tell lies about minute
3306,BLIND HARRY.,"circumstantials, but they rarely invent.'"

3588,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3589,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Here we have a great ascent from our former subject of biography--from
3590,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Blind Harry to James I.--from a beggar to a king. But in the Palace of
3591,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Poetry there are 'many mansions,' and men of all ranks, climes,"
3592,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"characters, professions, and we had almost added _talents_, have been"
3593,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"welcome to inhabit there. For, even as in the House Beautiful, the weak"
3594,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Ready-to-halt and the timid Much-afraid were as cheerfully received as
3595,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,the strong Honest and the bold Valiant-for-truth; so Poetry has inspired
3596,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"children, and seeming fools, and maniacs, and mendicants with the finest"
3597,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,breath of her spirit. The 'Fable-tree' Fontaine is as immortal as
3598,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Corneille; Christopher Smart's 'David' shall live as long as Milton's
3599,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"'Paradise Lost;' and the rude epic of a blind wanderer, whose birth,"
3600,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"parentage, and period of death are all alike unknown, shall continue to"
3601,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,rank in interest with the productions of one who inherited that kingdom
3602,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of Scotland, the independence of which was bought by the successive"
3603,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,efforts and the blended blood of Wallace and Bruce.
3604,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3605,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Let us now look for a moment at the history and the writings of this
3606,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,'Royal Poet.' The name will suggest to all intelligent readers the title
3607,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,of one of the most pleasing papers in Washington Irving's 'Sketch-book.'
3608,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"James I. was the son of Robert III. of Scotland,--a character familiar"
3609,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"to all from the admirable 'Fair Maid of Perth,'--and of Annabella"
3610,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Stewart. He was created Earl of Carrick; and after the miserable death
3611,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of the Duke of Rothesay, his elder brother, his father, apprehensive of"
3612,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the further designs of Albany, determined to send James to France, to"
3613,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,find an asylum and receive his education in that friendly Court. On his
3614,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"way, the vessel was captured off Flamborough Head by an English cruiser,"
3615,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"(the 13th of March 1405,) and the young prince, with his attendants, was"
3616,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"conveyed to London, and committed to the Tower. As there was a truce"
3617,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"between the two nations at the time, this was a flagrant outrage on the"
3618,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"law of nations, and has indelibly disgraced the memory of Henry IV.,"
3619,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"who, when some one remonstrated with him on the injustice of the"
3620,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"detention, replied, with cool brutality, 'Had the Scots been grateful,"
3621,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"they ought to have sent the youth to me, for I understand French well.'"
3622,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Here for nineteen years,--during the remainder of the life of Henry IV.,"
3623,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"and the whole of the reign of Henry V.,--James continued. He was"
3624,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"educated, however, highly, according to the fashion of these times,"
3625,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"--instructed in the languages, as well as in music, painting,"
3626,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"architecture, horticulture, dancing, fencing, poetry, and other"
3627,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,accomplishments. Still it must have fretted his high spirit to be
3628,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"passing his young life in prison, while without horses were stamping,"
3629,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"plumes glistening, trumpets sounding, tournaments waging, and echoes"
3630,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,from the great victories of Henry V. in France ringing around. One
3631,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"sweetener of his solitude, however, he at length enjoyed. Having been"
3632,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"transferred from the Tower to Windsor Castle, he beheld one day from its"
3633,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"windows that beautiful vision he has described in 'The King's Quhair,'"
3634,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"(see 'Specimens.') This was Lady Jane or Joanna Beaufort, daughter of"
3635,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the Earl of Somerset, niece of Richard II., and grand-daughter of John"
3636,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. She was a lady of great beauty and"
3637,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"accomplishments as well as of high rank, and James, even before he knew"
3638,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"her name, became deeply enamoured. The passion was returned, and their"
3639,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,mutual attachment had by and by an important bearing upon his prospects.
3640,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3641,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"In 1423, the Duke of Bedford being now the English Regent, the friends"
3642,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,of James renewed negotiations--often attempted before in vain--for his
3643,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"return to his native land, where his father had been long dead, and"
3644,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"which, torn by factions and steeped in blood, was sorely needing his"
3645,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,presence. Commissioners from the two kingdoms met at Pontefract on the
3646,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"12th of May 1423, when, in presence of the young King, and with his"
3647,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"consent, matters were arranged. The English coolly demanded £40,000 to"
3648,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"defray the expense of James's nurture and education, (as though a _bill_"
3649,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,were handed in to a man who had been unjustly detained in prison on
3650,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"a false charge, ere he left its walls,) insisted on the immediate"
3651,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"departure of the Scots from France, where a portion of them were"
3652,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fighting in the French army, and procured the assent of the Scottish"
3653,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Privy Council to the marriage of James with his beloved Jane Beaufort.
3654,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"A truce, too, with Scotland was concluded for seven years. All this was"
3655,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"settled; and soon after, in the Church of St Mary Overies, Southwark,"
3656,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"so often alluded to in the 'Life of Gower,' the happy pair were wed."
3657,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"It seemed a most auspicious event for both countries, and to augur"
3658,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,the substitution of permanent peace for casual and temporary truces.
3659,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"To Lady Jane Beaufort it gave a crown, and a noble, gallant, and gifted"
3660,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"prince to share it withal. On James it bestowed a lady of great beauty,"
3661,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"who was regarded, too, with gratitude as having lightened the load of"
3662,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"his captivity, and been a sunshine in his shady place, and--least"
3663,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"consideration--who brought him a dowry of £10,000, which was, in fact,"
3664,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,a remission of the fourth part of his ransom.
3665,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3666,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Attended by a magnificent retinue, the royal pair set out for Scotland."
3667,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,They were met at Durham by three hundred of the principal nobility and
3668,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"gentry, twenty-eight of whom were retained by the English as hostages"
3669,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"for the national faith. Arrived on his native soil, James, at Melrose"
3670,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Abbey, gave his solemn assent on the Holy Gospels to the treaty; and"
3671,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,seldom have the Eildon Hills returned a louder and more joyous shout
3672,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,of acclamation than now welcomed back to the kingdom of his fathers
3673,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the 'Royal Poet.' He proceeded to Edinburgh, where he celebrated Easter"
3674,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"with great pomp, and a month later, he and his queen were solemnly"
3675,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,crowned inthe Abbey Church at Scone. This was in 1424. He lived after
3676,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,this only thirteen years; but the period of his reign has always been
3677,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,thought a glorious interlude in the dark early history of Scotland.
3678,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"He set himself, with considerable success, to curb the exorbitant"
3679,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"power of the nobles, sacrificing some of them, such as Albany, to his"
3680,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,just indignation. He passed many useful regulations in reference to
3681,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the coinage, the constitution, and the commerce of the country. He"
3682,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,suppressed with a strong hand some of the gangs of robbers and 'sorners'
3683,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"which abounded, founding instead the order of Bedesmen or King's"
3684,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Beggars, immortalised since in the character of Edie Ochiltree. He"
3685,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,stretched a strong hand over the refractory Highland chieftains. While
3686,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"keeping at first on good terms with the English Court, he turned with a"
3687,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fonder eye to the French as the ancient allies of Scotland, and in 1436"
3688,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,gave his daughter Margaret in marriage to the Dauphin. This step roused
3689,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the jealousy of his southern neighbours, who tried even to intercept the"
3690,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fleet that was conveying the bride across the Channel, whereupon James,"
3691,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"stung to fury, proclaimed war against England, and in August commenced"
3692,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the siege of Roxburgh Castle. The castle, after being environed for"
3693,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fifteen days, was about to fall into his hands, when the Queen suddenly"
3694,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"arrived in the camp, and communicated some information, probably"
3695,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"referring to a threatened conspiracy of the nobles, which induced him"
3696,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"to throw up the siege, disband his army, and return northward in haste."
3697,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"This unexpected step probably retarded, but could not prevent the"
3698,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,dreadful purpose of death which had already been formed against the
3699,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,King.
3700,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3701,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"In October 1436, he held his last Parliament in Edinburgh, in which,"
3702,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"amidst many other enactments, we find, curiously enough, a prefiguration"
3703,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of the Forbes Mackenzie Act, in a decree that all taverns should be shut"
3704,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,at nine o'clock. In the end of the year he determined on retiring to
3705,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Perth, where (in the language of Gibbon, applied to Timour) 'he was"
3706,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"expected by the Angel of Death.' It is said that, when about to cross"
3707,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the Frith of Forth, then called the Scottish Sea, a Highland woman, who"
3708,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"claimed the character of a prophetess, like Meg Merrilees in fiction,"
3709,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"met the cavalcade, and cried out, with a loud voice, 'My Lord the King,"
3710,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,if you pass this water you shall never return again alive;' but as she
3711,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"was concluded to be mad or drunk, her warning was scorned. He betook"
3712,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"himself to the convent of the Black Friars, where Christmas was being"
3713,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"celebrated with great pomp and splendour. Meanwhile Robert Grahame, and"
3714,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Walter, Earl of Athole, the King's own uncle, actuated, the former by"
3715,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,revenge on account of the resumption of some lands improperly granted
3716,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"to his family, and the latter by a desire to succeed to the Crown, had"
3717,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"formed a plot against James's life. Several warnings, besides that of"
3718,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the Highland seeress, the King received, but he heeded them not, and,"
3719,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"like most of the doomed, was in unnaturally high spirits, as if the"
3720,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,winding-sheet far up his breast had been a wedding-robe.
3721,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3722,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,It is the evening of the 20th of February 1437. James and his nobles and
3723,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"ladies are seated at table till deep into the night, engaged in chess,"
3724,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"music, and song. Athole, like another Judas, has supped with them, and"
3725,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,gone out at a late hour. A tremendous knocking is heard at the gate. It
3726,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"is the Highland prophetess, who, having followed the monarch to Perth,"
3727,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"is seeking to force her way into the room. The King tells her, through"
3728,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"his usher, that he cannot receive her to-night, but will hear her"
3729,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"tidings to-morrow. She retires reluctantly, murmuring that they will for"
3730,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,ever rue their refusal to admit her into the royal presence. About an
3731,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"hour after this, James calls for the _Voidee_, or parting-cup, and the"
3732,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"company disperse. Sir Robert Stewart, the chamberlain, who is in the"
3733,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"confidence of the conspirators, is the last to retire, having previously"
3734,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,destroyed the locks and removed the bars of the doors of the royal bed-
3735,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,chamber and the outer room adjoining. The King is standing before the
3736,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fire, in his night-gown and slippers, and talking gaily with the Queen"
3737,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"and her ladies, when torches are seen flashing up from the garden, and"
3738,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,the clash of arms and the sound of angry voices is heard from below. A
3739,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,sense of the dread reality bursts on them in an instant. The Queen and
3740,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the ladies run to secure the door of the chamber, while James, seizing"
3741,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the tongs, wrenches up one of the boards of the floor and takes refuge"
3742,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"in a vault beneath. This was wont to have an opening to the outer court,"
3743,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"but it had unfortunately been built up of late by his own orders. There,"
3744,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"under the replaced boards, cowers the King, while the Queen and her"
3745,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"women seek to barricade the door. One brave young lady, Catherine"
3746,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Douglas, thrusts her beautiful arm into the staple from which the bolt"
3747,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"had been removed. It is broken in a moment, and she sinks back, to bear,"
3748,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,with her descendants--a family well known in Scotland--the name of
3749,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"_Barlass_ ever since. The murderers, who had previously killed in the"
3750,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"passage one Walter Straiton, a page, rush in, with naked swords,"
3751,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"wounding the ladies, striking, and well-nigh killing the Queen, and"
3752,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"crying, with frantic imprecations, 'This is but a woman! Where is"
3753,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"James?' Finding him not in the chamber, they leave it, and disperse"
3754,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,through the neighbouring apartments in search.
3755,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3756,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"James, who had become wearied of his immurement, and thought the"
3757,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"assassins were gone, calls now on one of the ladies to aid him in coming"
3758,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"out of his place of concealment. But while this is being effected, one"
3759,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of the murderers returns. The cry, 'Found, found,' rings through the"
3760,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"halls; and after a violent but unarmed resistance, the King is, with"
3761,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"circumstances of horrible barbarity, first mangled, then run through the"
3762,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"body, and then despatched with daggers. In vain he offers half his"
3763,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"kingdom for his life; and when he seeks a confessor from Grahame, the"
3764,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"ruffian replies, 'Thou shalt have no confessor but this sword.' It is"
3765,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"satisfactory to know that the Queen made her escape, and that the"
3766,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"criminals were punished, although the tortures they endured are such"
3767,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"as human nature shrinks from conceiving, and history with a shudder"
3768,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,records.

3773,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,although there is so little of it that a sentence or two will suffice.
3774,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"'The King's Quhair' is a poem conceived very much in the spirit, and"
3775,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"written in the style of Chaucer, whose works were favourites with James."
3776,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"There is the same sympathy with nature, and the same perception of _its_"
3777,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"relation to and unconscious sympathy with human feelings, and the same"
3778,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"luscious richness in the description, alike of the early beauties of"
3779,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"spring and of youthful feminine loveliness, although this seems more"
3780,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,natural in the young poet James than in the sexagenarian author of 'The
3781,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Canterbury Tales.' There is nothing even in Chaucer we think finer than

3864,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"except Cromwell, to whom, however, the term 'genius,' in its common"

4011,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,The first of these is the only versifier that can be assigned to England
4012,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"in the reign of Henry IV. His name was John Walton, though he was"
4013,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,generally known as _Johannes Capellanus_ or 'John the Chaplain.' He was
4014,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"canon of Oseney, and died sub-dean of York. He, in the year 1410,"
4015,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"translated Boethius' famous treatise, 'De Consolatione Philosophiae,'"
4016,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,into English verse. He is not known to have written anything original.
4017,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"--Thomas Occleve appeared in the reign of Henry V., about 1420. Like"
4018,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"Chaucer and Gower, he was a student of municipal law, having attended"
4019,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"Chester's Inn, which stood on the site of the present Somerset House;"
4020,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"but although he trod in the footsteps of his celebrated predecessors, it"
4021,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"was with far feebler powers. His original pieces are contemptible, both"
4022,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,in subject and in execution. His best production is a translation of
4023,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"'Egidius De Regimine Principum.' Warton, alluding to the period at which"
4024,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"these writers appeared, has the following oft-quoted observations:"
4025,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,--'I consider Chaucer as a genial day in an English spring. A brilliant
4026,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual lustre; the sudden
4027,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"appearance of cloudless skies, and the unexpected warmth of a tepid"
4028,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"atmosphere, after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter,"
4029,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer, and we"
4030,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity.
4031,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,But winter returns with redoubled horrors; the clouds condense more
4032,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"formidably than before, and those tender buds and early blossoms which"
4033,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sunshine, are"
4034,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"nipped by frosts and torn by tempests.' These sentences are, after all,"
4035,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"rather pompous, and express, in the most verbose style of the _Rambler_,"
4036,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"the simple fact, that after Chaucer's death the ground lay fallow, and"
4037,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,that for a while in England (in Scotland it was otherwise) there were
4038,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"few poets, and little poetry."

4043,JOHN LYDGATE.,JOHN LYDGATE.
4044,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4045,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4046,JOHN LYDGATE.,This copious and versatile writer flourished in the reign of Henry VI.
4047,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Warton affirms that he reached his highest point of eminence in 1430,"
4048,JOHN LYDGATE.,although some of his poems had appeared before. He was a monk of the
4049,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Benedictine Abbey at Bury, in Suffolk. He received his education at"
4050,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Oxford; and when it was finished, he travelled through France and Italy,"
4051,JOHN LYDGATE.,"mastering the languages and literature of both countries, and studying"
4052,JOHN LYDGATE.,"their poets, particularly Dante, Boccaccio, and Alain Chartier. When he"
4053,JOHN LYDGATE.,"returned, he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of"
4054,JOHN LYDGATE.,the nobility composition and the art of versification. His acquirements
4055,JOHN LYDGATE.,"were, for the age, universal. He was a poet, a rhetorician, an astronomer,"
4056,JOHN LYDGATE.,"a mathematician, a public disputant, and a theologian. He was born in"
4057,JOHN LYDGATE.,"1370, ordained sub-deacon in 1389, deacon in 1393, and priest in 1397."
4058,JOHN LYDGATE.,"The time of his death is uncertain. His great patron was Humphrey, Duke"
4059,JOHN LYDGATE.,"of Gloucester, to whom he complains sometimes of necessitous circumstances,"
4060,JOHN LYDGATE.,"which were, perhaps, produced by indulgence, since he confesses himself to"
4061,JOHN LYDGATE.,be 'a lover of wine.'
4062,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4063,JOHN LYDGATE.,The great merit of Lydgate is his versatility. This Warton has happily
4064,JOHN LYDGATE.,"expressed in a few sentences, which we shall quote:--"
4065,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4066,JOHN LYDGATE.,'He moves with equal ease in every form of composition. His hymns and
4067,JOHN LYDGATE.,his ballads have the same degree of merit; and whether his subject be
4068,JOHN LYDGATE.,"the life of a hermit or a hero, of Saint Austin or Guy, Earl of Warwick,"
4069,JOHN LYDGATE.,"ludicrous or legendary, religious or romantic, a history or an allegory,"
4070,JOHN LYDGATE.,"he writes with facility. His transitions were rapid, from works of the"
4071,JOHN LYDGATE.,"most serious and laborious kind, to sallies of levity and pieces of"
4072,JOHN LYDGATE.,popular entertainment. His muse was of universal access; and he was not
4073,JOHN LYDGATE.,"only the poet of his monastery, but of the world in general. If a"
4074,JOHN LYDGATE.,"disguising was intended by the Company of Goldsmiths, a mask before His"
4075,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Majesty at Eltham, a May game for the sheriffs and aldermen of London,"
4076,JOHN LYDGATE.,"a mumming before the Lord Mayor, a procession of pageants, from the"
4077,JOHN LYDGATE.,"""Creation,"" for the Festival of Corpus Christi, or a carol for the"
4078,JOHN LYDGATE.,"coronation, Lydgate was consulted, and gave the poetry.'"
4079,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4080,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Lydgate is, so far as we know, the first British bard who wrote for"
4081,JOHN LYDGATE.,"hire. At the request of Whethamstede, the Abbot of St Alban's, he"
4082,JOHN LYDGATE.,"translated a 'Life of St Alban' from Latin into English rhymes, and"
4083,JOHN LYDGATE.,"received for the whole work one hundred shillings. His principal poems,"
4084,JOHN LYDGATE.,"all founded on the works of other authors, are the 'Fall of Princes,'"
4085,JOHN LYDGATE.,"the 'Siege of Thebes,' and the 'Destruction of Troy.' They are written"
4086,JOHN LYDGATE.,"in a diffuse and verbose style, but are generally clear in sense, and"
4087,JOHN LYDGATE.,often very luxuriant in description. 'The London Lyckpenny' is a
4088,JOHN LYDGATE.,"fugitive poem, in which the author describes himself coming up to town"
4089,JOHN LYDGATE.,"in search of legal redress for a wrong, and gives some curious"
4090,JOHN LYDGATE.,particulars of the condition of that city in the early part of the
4091,JOHN LYDGATE.,fifteenth century.

4242,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,
4243,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,John Harding flourished about the year 1403. He fought at the battle of
4244,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,Shrewsbury on the Percy side. He is the author of a poem entitled 'The
4245,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Chronicle of England unto the Reign of King Edward the Fourth, in"
4246,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Verse.' It has no poetic merit, and little interest, except to the"
4247,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,antiquary. In the reign of the above king we find the first mention of
4248,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"a Poet Laureate. John Kay was appointed by Edward, when he returned from"
4249,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Italy, Poet Laureate to the king, but has, perhaps fortunately for the"
4250,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"world, left behind him no poems. Would that the same had been the case"
4251,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"with some of his successors in the office! There is reason to believe,"
4252,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"that for nearly two centuries ere this date, there had existed in the"
4253,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"court a personage, entitled the King's Versifier, (versificator,) to"
4254,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"whom one hundred shillings a-year was the salary, and that the title"
4255,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"was, by and by, changed to that of Poet Laureate, _i.e._, Laurelled"
4256,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,Poet. It had long been customary in the universities to crown scholars
4257,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"when they graduated with laurel, and Warton thinks that from these the"
4258,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"first poet laureates were selected, less for their general genius than"
4259,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,for their skill in Latin verse. Certainly the earliest of the Laureate
4260,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"poems, such as those by Baston and Gulielmus, who acted as royal poets"
4261,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"to Richard I. and Edward II., and wrote, the one on Richard's Crusade,"
4262,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"and the other on Edward's Siege of Stirling Castle, are in Latin. So"
4263,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"too are the productions of Andrew Bernard, who was the Poet Laureate"
4264,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,successively to Henry VII. and Henry VIII. It was not till after the
4265,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,Reformation had lessened the superstitious veneration for the Latin
4266,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,tongue that the laureates began to write in English. It is almost a
4267,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"pity, we are sometimes disposed to think, that, in reference to such"
4268,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"odes as those of Pye, Whitehead, Colley Cibber, and even some of"
4269,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Southey's, the old practice had not continued; since thus, in the first"
4270,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"place, we might have had a chance of elegant Latinity, in the absence of"
4271,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"poetry and sense; and since, secondly, the deficiencies of the laureate"
4272,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"poems would have been disguised, from the general eye at least, under"
4273,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,the veil of an unknown tongue. It is curious to notice about this period
4274,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"the uprise of two didactic poets, both writing on alchymy, the chemistry"
4275,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"of that day, and neither displaying a spark of genius. These are John"
4276,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Norton and George Ripley, both renowned for learning and knowledge of"
4277,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"their beloved occult sciences. Their poems, that by Norton, entitled"
4278,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"'The Ordinal,' and that by Ripley, entitled 'The Compound of Alchemie,'"
4279,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"are dry and rugged treatises, done into indifferent verse. One rather"
4280,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,fine fancy occurs in the first of these. It is that of an alchymist who
4281,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"projected a bridge of gold over the Thames, near London, crowned with"
4282,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"pinnacles of gold, which, being studded with carbuncles, should diffuse"
4283,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,a blaze of light in the dark! Alchymy has had other and nobler singers
4284,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"than Ripley and Norton. It has, as Warton remarks, 'enriched the store-"
4285,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,house of Arabian romance with many magnificent imageries.' It is the
4286,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,inspiration of two of the noblest romances in this or any language
4287,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"--'St. Leon' and 'Zanoni.' And its idea, transfigured into a transcen-"
4288,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"dental form, gave light and life and fire, and the loftiest poetry, to"
4289,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"the eloquence of the lamented Samuel Brown, whose tongue, as he talked"
4290,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"on his favourite theme, seemed transmuted into gold; nay, whose lips,"
4291,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"like the touch of Midas, seemed to create the effects of alchymy upon"
4292,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"every subject they approached, and upon every heart over which they"
4293,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,wielded their sorcery.
4294,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,
4295,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,We pass now from this comparatively barren age in the history of English
4296,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,poetry to a cluster of Scottish bards. The first of these is ROBERT
4297,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"HENRYSON. He was schoolmaster at Dunfermline, and died some time before"
4298,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,1508. He is supposed by Lord Hailes to have been preceptor of youth in
4299,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,the Benedictine convent in that place. He is the author of 'Robene and
4300,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Makyne,' a pastoral ballad of very considerable merit, and of which"
4301,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Campbell says, somewhat too warmly, 'It is the first known pastoral,'"
4302,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"(he means in the Scottish language of course,) 'and one of the best, in"
4303,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,a dialect rich with the favours of the pastoral muse.' He wrote also a
4304,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,sequel to Chaucer's 'Troilus and Cresseide' entitled 'The Testament of
4305,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Cresseide,' and thirteen Fables, of which copies, in MS., are preserved"
4306,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. One of these, 'The Town and"
4307,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Country Mouse,' tells that old story with considerable spirit and"
4308,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,humour. 'The Garment of Good Ladies' is an ingenious and beautiful
4309,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"strain, written in that quaint style of allegorising which continued"
4310,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"popular as far down as the days of Cowley, and even later."

4548,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4549,WILLIAM DUNBAR,This was a man of the true and sovereign seed of genius. Sir Walter
4550,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Scott calls Dunbar 'a poet unrivalled by any--that Scotland has ever
4551,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"produced.' We venture to call him the Dante of Scotland; nay, we"
4552,WILLIAM DUNBAR,question if any English poet has surpassed 'The Dance of the Seven
4553,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Deadly Sins through Hell' in its peculiarly Dantesque qualities of
4554,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"severe and purged grandeur; of deep sincerity, and in that air of moral"
4555,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"disappointment and sorrow, approaching despair, which distinguished the"
4556,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"sad-hearted lover of Beatrice, who might almost have exclaimed, with one"
4557,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"yet mightier than he in his misery and more miserable in his might,"
4558,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4559,WILLIAM DUNBAR,'Where'er I am is Hell--myself am Hell.'
4560,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4561,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Foster, in an entry in his journal, (we quote from memory,) says, 'I"
4562,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"have just seen the moon rising, and wish the impression to be eternal."
4563,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"What a look she casts upon earth, like that of a celestial being who"
4564,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"loves our planet still, but has given up all hope of ever doing her any"
4565,WILLIAM DUNBAR,good or seeing her become any better--so serene she seems in her settled
4566,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"and unutterable sadness.' Such, we have often fancied, was the feeling"
4567,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"of the great Florentine toward the world, and which--pained, pitying,"
4568,WILLIAM DUNBAR,yearning enthusiast that he was!--escaped irresistibly from those deep-
4569,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"set eyes, that adamantine jaw, and that brow, wearing the laurel, proudly"
4570,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"yet painfully, as if it were a crown of everlasting fire! Dunbar was not"
4571,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"altogether a Dante, either in melancholy or in power, but his 'Dance'"
4572,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"reveals kindred moods, operating at times on a kindred genius."
4573,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4574,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"In Dante humour existed too, but ere it could come up from his deep"
4575,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"nature to the surface, it must freeze and stiffen into monumental scorn"
4576,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"--a laughter that seemed, while mocking at all things else, to mock at"
4577,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"its own mockery most of all. Aird speaks in his 'Demoniac,' of a smile"
4578,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"upon his hero's brow,"
4579,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4580,WILLIAM DUNBAR,'Like the lightning of a hope about to DIE
4581,WILLIAM DUNBAR,For ever from the furrow'd brows of Hell's Eternity.'
4582,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4583,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Dante's smile may rather be compared to the RISING of a false and self-
4584,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"detected hope upon the lost brows where it is never to come to dawn, and"
4585,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"where, nevertheless, it remains for ever, like a smile carved upon"
4586,WILLIAM DUNBAR,a sepulchre. Dunbar has a more joyous disposition than his Italian
4587,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"prototype and master, and he indulges himself to the top of his bent,"
4588,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"but in a style (particularly in his 'Twa Married Women and the Widow,'"
4589,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"and in 'The Friars of Berwick,' which is not, however, quite certainly"
4590,WILLIAM DUNBAR,his) too coarse and prurient for the taste of this age.
4591,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4592,WILLIAM DUNBAR,'The Merle and the Nightingale' is one of the finest of Moelibean poems.
4593,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Beautiful is the contest between the two sweet singers as to whether the
4594,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"love of man or the love of God be the nobler, and more beautiful still"
4595,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"their reconciliation, when"
4596,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4597,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"'Then sang they both with voices loud and clear,"
4598,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Merle sang, ""Man, love God that has thee wrought."""
4599,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Nightingale sang, ""Man, love the Lord most dear,"
4600,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"That thee and all this world made of nought."""
4601,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Merle said, ""Love him that thy love has sought"
4602,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"From heaven to earth, and here took flesh and bone."""
4603,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Nightingale sang. ""And with his death thee bought:"
4604,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"All love is lost, but upon him alone."""
4605,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4606,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"_'Then flew these birds over the boughis sheen,"
4607,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Singing of love among the leaves small.'_
4608,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4609,WILLIAM DUNBAR,William Dunbar is said to have been born about the year 1465. He
4610,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"received his education at St Andrews, and took there the degree of M.A."
4611,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"in 1479. He became then a friar of the Franciscan order, (Grey Friars,)"
4612,WILLIAM DUNBAR,and in the exercise of his profession seems to have rambled over all
4613,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Scotland, England, and France, preaching, begging, and, according to his"
4614,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"own confession, cheating, lying, and cajoling. Yet if this kind of life"
4615,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"was not propitious, in his case, to morality, it must have been to the"
4616,WILLIAM DUNBAR,development of the poetic faculty. It enabled him to see all varieties
4617,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"of life and of scenery, although here and there, in his verses, you find"
4618,WILLIAM DUNBAR,symptoms of that bitterness which is apt to arise in the heart of a
4619,WILLIAM DUNBAR,wanderer. He was subsequently employed by James IV. in some official
4620,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"work connected with various foreign embassies, which led him to Spain,"
4621,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Italy, and Germany, as well as England and France. This proves that he"
4622,WILLIAM DUNBAR,was no less a man of business-capacity and habits than a poet. For these
4623,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"services he, in 1500, received from the King a pension of ten pounds,"
4624,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"afterwards increased to twenty, and, in fine, to eighty. He is said to"
4625,WILLIAM DUNBAR,have been employed in the negotiations preparatory to the marriage of
4626,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"James with Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII., which took place in"
4627,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"1503, and which our poet celebrated in his verses, 'The Thistle and the"
4628,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Rose.' He continued ever afterwards in the Court, hovering in position"
4629,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"between a laureate and a court-fool, charming James with his witty"
4630,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"conversation as well as his verses, but refused the benefices for which"
4631,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"he petitioned, and gradually devoured by chagrin and disappointment."
4632,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Seldom has genius so great been placed in a falser position, and this"
4633,WILLIAM DUNBAR,has given a querulous tinge to many of his poems. He seems to have died
4634,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"about 1520. Even after his death, misfortune pursued him. His works"
4635,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"were, with the exception of two or three pieces, locked up in an obscure"
4636,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"MS. till the middle of last century. Since then, however, their fame has"
4637,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"been still increasing. In 1834, Mr David Laing, so favourably known as"
4638,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"one of our first antiquarians, published a complete and elaborate edition"
4639,WILLIAM DUNBAR,of Dunbar's works; and in a newspaper this very day (May 23) we see another
4640,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"edition announced, in a popular and modernised shape, of the poetry of this"
4641,WILLIAM DUNBAR,great old Scottish _Makkar_.

5038,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,
5039,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"This eminent prelate was a younger son of Archibald, the fifth Earl of"
5040,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,Angus. He was born in Brechin about the year 1474. He studied at the
5041,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"University of Paris. He became a churchman, and yet united with"
5042,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,attention to the duties of his calling great proficiency in polite
5043,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"learning. In 1513 he finished a translation, into Scottish verse, of"
5044,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Virgil's 'Aeneid,' which, considering the age, is an extraordinary"
5045,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,performance. It occupied him only sixteen months. The multitude of
5046,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"obsolete terms, however, in which it abounds, renders it now, as a"
5047,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"whole, illegible. After passing through various subordinate offices,"
5048,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"such as the 'Provostship' of St Giles's, Edinburgh, and the 'Abbotship'"
5049,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"of Arbroath, he was at length appointed Bishop of Dunkeld. Dunkeld was"
5050,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"not then the paradise it has become, but Birnam hill and the other"
5051,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"mountains then, as now, stood round about it, the old Cathedral rose up"
5052,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"in mediaeval majesty, and the broad, smooth Tay flowed onward to the"
5053,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"ocean. And, doubtless, Douglas felt the poetic inspiration from it quite"
5054,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"as warmly as did Thomas Brown, when, three centuries afterwards, he set"
5055,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"up the staff of his summer rest at the beautiful Invar inn, and thence"
5056,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,delighted to diverge to the hundred scenes of enchantment which stretch
5057,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"around. The good Bishop was an ardent politician as well as a poet, and"
5058,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"was driven, by his share in the troubles of the times, to flee from his"
5059,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"native land, and take refuge in the Court of Henry VIII. The King"
5060,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"received him kindly, and treated him with much liberality. In 1522 he"
5061,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"died at London of the plague, and was interred in the Savoy Church."
5062,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"He was, according to Buchanan, about to proceed to Rome to vindicate"
5063,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,himself before the Pope against certain charges brought by his enemies.
5064,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Besides the translation of the 'Aeneid,' Douglas is the author of a long"
5065,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"poem entitled the 'Palace of Honour;' it is an allegory, describing"
5066,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,a large company making a pilgrimage to Honour's Palace. It bears
5067,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"considerable resemblance to the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' and some suppose"
5068,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,that Bunyan had seen it before composing his allegory. 'King Hart' is
5069,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"another production of our poet's, of considerable length and merit. It"
5070,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"gives, metaphorically, a view of human life. Perhaps his best pieces are"
5071,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"his 'Prologues,' affixed to each book of the 'Aeneid.' From them we have"
5072,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,selected 'Morning in May' as a specimen. The closing lines are fine.
5073,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,
5074,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"'Welcome the lord of light, and lamp of day,"
5075,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome fosterer of tender herbis green,"
5076,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome quickener of flourish'd flowers sheen,"
5077,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome support of every root and vein,"
5078,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome comfort of all kind fruit and grain,' &c."
5079,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,
5080,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,Douglas must not be named with Dunbar in strength and grandeur of
5081,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"genius. His power is more in expression than in conception, and hence"
5082,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,he has shone so much in translation. His version of the 'Aeneid' is the
5083,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"first made of any classic into a British tongue, and is the worthy"
5084,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,progenitor of such minor miracles of poetical talent--all somewhat more
5085,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"mechanical than inspired, and yet giving a real, though subordinate"
5086,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"glory to our literature-as Fairfax's 'Tasso,' Dryden's 'Virgil,' and"
5087,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Pope's, Coper's, and Sotheby's 'Homer.' The fire in Douglas' original"
5088,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"verses is occasionally lost in smoke, and the meaning buried in flowery"
5089,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,verbiage. Still he was an honour alike to the Episcopal bench and the
5090,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Muse of Scotland. He was of amiable manners, gentle temperament, and a"
5091,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,noble and commanding appearance.

5276,MORNING IN MAY.,"Stephen Hawes, a native of Suffolk, wrote about the close of the"
5277,MORNING IN MAY.,"fifteenth century. He studied at Oxford, and travelled much in France,"
5278,MORNING IN MAY.,"where he became a master of French and Italian poetry. King Henry VII.,"
5279,MORNING IN MAY.,struck with his conversation and the readiness with which he repeated
5280,MORNING IN MAY.,"old English poets, especially Lydgate, created him groom of the privy"
5281,MORNING IN MAY.,"chamber. Hawes has written a number of poems, such as 'The Temple of"
5282,MORNING IN MAY.,"Glasse,' 'The Conversion of Swearers,' 'The Consolation of Lovers,' 'The"
5283,MORNING IN MAY.,"Pastime of Pleasure,' &c. Those who wish to see specimens of the strange"
5284,MORNING IN MAY.,"allegories and curious devices of thought in which it abounds, may find"
5285,MORNING IN MAY.,them in Warton's 'History of English Poetry.'
5286,MORNING IN MAY.,
5287,MORNING IN MAY.,"In that same valuable work we find an account of Alexander Barclay, author"
5288,MORNING IN MAY.,"of 'The Ship of Fools.' He was educated at Oriel College in Oxford, and"
5289,MORNING IN MAY.,"after travelling abroad, was appointed one of the priests or prebendaries"
5290,MORNING IN MAY.,"of the College of St Mary Ottery, in Devonshire--a parish famous in later"
5291,MORNING IN MAY.,days for the birth of Coleridge. Barclay became afterwards a Benedictine
5292,MORNING IN MAY.,"monk of Ely monastery; and at length a brother of the Order of St Francis,"
5293,MORNING IN MAY.,"at Canterbury. He died, a very old man, at Croydon, in Surrey, in the year"
5294,MORNING IN MAY.,"1552. His principal work, 'The Ship of Fools,' is a satire upon the vices"
5295,MORNING IN MAY.,"and absurdities of his age, and shews considerable wit and power of"
5296,MORNING IN MAY.,sarcasm.

5304,SKELTON.,John Skelton is the name of the next poet. He flourished in the earlier
5305,SKELTON.,part of the reign of Henry VIII. Having studied both at Oxford and
5306,SKELTON.,"Cambridge, and been laureated at the former university in 1489, he was"
5307,SKELTON.,"promoted to the rectory of Diss or Dysse, in Norfolk. Some say he had"
5308,SKELTON.,acted previously as tutor to Henry VIII. At Dysse he attracted attention
5309,SKELTON.,"by satirical ballads against the mendicants, as well as by licences of"
5310,SKELTON.,"buffoonery in the pulpit. For these he was censured, and even, it is"
5311,SKELTON.,"said, suspended, by Nykke, Bishop of Norwich. Undaunted by this, he flew"
5312,SKELTON.,"at higher game--ventured to ridicule Cardinal Wolsey, then in his power,"
5313,SKELTON.,and had to take refuge from the myrmidons of the prelate in Westminster
5314,SKELTON.,Abbey. There Abbot Islip kindly entertained and protected him till his
5315,SKELTON.,"dying day. He breathed his last in the year 1529, and was buried in the"
5316,SKELTON.,adjacent church of St Margaret's.
5317,SKELTON.,
5318,SKELTON.,Skelton as well as Barclay enjoyed considerable popularity in his own
5319,SKELTON.,age. Erasmus calls him 'Britannicarum literarum lumen et decus!' How
5320,SKELTON.,dark must have been the night in which such a Will-o'-wisp was mistaken
5321,SKELTON.,"for a star! He has wit, indeed, and satirical observation; but his wit"
5322,SKELTON.,"is wilder than it is strong, and his satire is dashed with personality"
5323,SKELTON.,"and obscenity. His style, Campbell observes, is 'almost a texture of"
5324,SKELTON.,"slang phrases, patched with shreds of French and Latin.' His verses on"
5325,SKELTON.,"Margaret Hussey, which we have quoted, are in his happiest vein. The"
5326,SKELTON.,"following lines, too, on Cardinal Wolsey, are as true as they are"
5327,SKELTON.,terse:--
5328,SKELTON.,
5329,SKELTON.,'Then in the Chamber of Stars
5330,SKELTON.,All matter there he mars.
5331,SKELTON.,"Clapping his rod on the board,"

5390,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Returning to Scotland, we find a Skelton of a higher order and a"
5391,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"brawnier make in Sir David Lyndsay, or, as our forefathers were wont"
5392,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"familiarly to denominate him, 'Davie Lyndsay.' Lyndsay was descended"
5393,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"from a noble family, a younger branch of Lyndsay of the Byres, and born"
5394,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"in 1490, probably at the Mount, the family-seat, near Cupar-Fife. He"
5395,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"entered the University of St Andrews in the year 1505, and four years"
5396,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"later left it to travel in Italy. He must, however, have returned to"
5397,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Scotland before the 12th of October 1511, since we learn from the"
5398,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,records of the Lord Treasurer that he was presented with a quantity of
5399,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,'blue and yellow taffety to be a playcoat for the play performed in the
5400,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,King and Queen's presence in the Abbey of Holyrood.' On the 12th of
5401,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"April 1512, Lyndsay, then twenty-two years of age, was appointed"
5402,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"gentleman-usher to James V., who had been born that very day. In his"
5403,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"poem called 'The Dream,' he reminds the King of his having borne him"
5404,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,in his arms ere he could walk; of having wrapped him up warmly in his
5405,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"little bed; of having sung to him with his lute, danced before him to"
5406,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"make him laugh, and having carried him on his shoulders like a 'pedlar"
5407,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his pack.' He continued to be page and companion to the King till 1524,"
5408,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"when, in consequence of the unprincipled machinations of the Queen-"
5409,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"mother--who was acting as Regent--he, as well as Bellenden, the learned"
5410,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"translator of Livy and Boece, was ejected from his office. When, however,"
5411,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"in 1528, the young King, by a noble effort, emancipated himself from the"
5412,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"thraldom of his mother and the Douglasses, Lyndsay wrote his 'Dream,' in"
5413,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"which, amidst much poetic or fantastic matter, he congratulates James on"
5414,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his deliverance; reminds him, as aforesaid, of his early services; and"
5415,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,takes occasion to paint the evils the country had endured during his
5416,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"minority, and to give him some bold and salutary advice as to his future"
5417,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"conduct. The next year (1529) he produced 'The Complaint,' a poem in"
5418,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"which he recurs to former themes, and remonstrates with great freedom"
5419,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and severity against the treatment he had undergone. Here, too, the"
5420,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,religious reformer peeps out. He exhorts the King to compel the clergy
5421,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,to attend to the duties of their office; to preach more earnestly; to
5422,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,administer the sacraments according to the institution of Christ; and not
5423,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"to deceive their people with superstitious pilgrimages, vain traditions,"
5424,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and prayers to graven images, contrary to the written command of God. He"
5425,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"with quaint iron says, that if his Grace will lend him"
5426,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5427,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'Of gold ane thousand pound or tway,'"
5428,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5429,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"he will give him a sealed bond, obliging himself to repay the loan when"
5430,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,the Bass and the Isle of May are set upon Mount Sinai; or the Lomond
5431,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"hills, near Falkland, are removed to Northumberland; or"
5432,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5433,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'When kirkmen yairnis [desire] na dignity,"
5434,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Nor wives na soveranitie.'
5435,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5436,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Still finer the last lines of the poem. 'If not,' he says, 'my God"
5437,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5438,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,'Shall cause me stand content
5439,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"With quiet life and sober rent,"
5440,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"And take me, in my latter age,"
5441,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Unto my simple hermitage,"
5442,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"To spend the gear my elders won,"
5443,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,As did Diogenes in his tun.'
5444,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5445,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"This 'Complaint' proved successful, and in the next year (1530) Lyndsay"
5446,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,was appointed Lion King-at-Arms--an office of great dignity in these
5447,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,days. The Lion was the chief judge of all matters connected with
5448,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,heraldry in the realm; was also the official ambassador from his
5449,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,sovereign to foreign countries; and was inaugurated in his office with
5450,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"a pomp and circumstance little inferior to those of a royal coronation,"
5451,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the King crowning him with his own hands, anointing him with wine"
5452,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"instead of oil, and putting on his head the Royal Crown of Scotland,"
5453,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,which he continued to wear till the close of the feast. It is of Lyndsay
5454,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,in the full accoutrements of this office that Sir Walter Scott speaks in
5455,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his 'Marmion,' although he antedates by sixteen years the time when he"

5488,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Lord Lion King-at-Arms.'
5489,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5490,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Soon after this appointment, Lyndsay wrote 'The Complaint of the King's"
5491,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Papingo,' in which, through the mouth of a dying parrot, he gives some"
5492,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"sharp counsel to the king, his courtiers and nobles, and administers"
5493,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,severe satirical chastisement to the corruptions of the clergy. It is an
5494,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"exceedingly clever production, and has some beautiful poetry as well as"
5495,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"stinging sarcasm. Take the following address to Edinburgh, Stirling,"
5496,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Linlithgow, and Falkland:--"
5497,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5498,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Adieu, Edinburgh! thou high triumphant town,"
5499,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Within whose bounds right blitheful have I been;

5501,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Most ready to receive court, king, and queen;"
5502,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Thy policy and justice may be seen;

5504,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"And credence tint, they micht be found in thee."
5505,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5506,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Adieu, fair Snawdoun! [Stirling] with thy towers hie,"
5507,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Thy chapel-royal, park, and table round;"
5508,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"May, June, and July would I dwell in thee,"
5509,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Were I a man to hear the birdis sound,"
5510,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Which doth against the royal rock rebound.
5511,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Adieu, Lithgow! whose palace of pleasance"
5512,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Meets not its peer in Portingale or France.
5513,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5514,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Farewell, Falkland! the forteress of Fife,"
5515,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Thy velvet park under the Lomond Law;
5516,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Sometime in thee I led a lusty life.

5518,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Caust men to come to thee, they have great awe, &c."
5519,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5520,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"In the year 1535, Lyndsay wrote his remarkable drama, 'The Satire of the"
5521,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Three Estates'--Monarch, namely, Barons, and Clergy. It is made up in"
5522,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"nearly three equal parts of ingenuity, wit, and grossness. It is a drama,"
5523,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and was acted several times--first, in 1535, at Cupar-Fife, on a large"
5524,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"green mound called Moot-hill; then, in 1539, in an open park near"
5525,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Linlithgow, by the express desire of the king, who with all the ladies"
5526,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,of the Court attended the representation; then in the amphitheatre of
5527,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"St Johnston in Perth; and in 1554, at Edinburgh, in the village of"
5528,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Greenside, which skirted the northern base of the Calton Hill, in the"
5529,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,presence of the Queen Regent and an enormous concourse of spectators.
5530,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Its exhibition appears to have occupied nearly the whole day. In the
5531,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'Pictorial History of Scotland,' chapter xxiv., our readers will find a"
5532,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,full and able analysis with extracts of this extraordinary performance.
5533,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,It is said to have done much good in opening the eyes of the people to
5534,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the evils of the Papacy, and in paving the way for the Reformation."
5535,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5536,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"In 1536 Sir David, in company with Sir John Campbell of Lundie, was sent"
5537,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,to the Court of France to demand in marriage for James V. a daughter of
5538,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,the House of Vendome; but the King chose rather to take the matter in
5539,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his own hands, and, going over in person, wedded Magdalene, daughter of"
5540,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Francis. She died two months after her arrival in Scotland, universally"
5541,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"regretted; and Lyndsay made the sad event the subject of a poem,"
5542,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"entitled 'Deploration of the Death of Queen Magdalene,' whom he"
5543,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,designates
5544,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5545,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'The flower of France, and comfort of Scotland.'"
5546,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5547,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"When James subsequently married Mary of Guise, Sir David's ingenuity was"
5548,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"strained to the utmost in providing pageants, masques, and shows to"
5549,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"welcome her Majesty. For forty days in St Andrews, festivities continued;"
5550,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and it was during this prolonged festival that the Lion King, as if sick"
5551,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and satiated with vanities, wrote two poems, one entitled 'The Justing"
5552,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"between James Watson and John Barbour,' a dull satire on tournaments, &c.,"
5553,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and the other a somewhat cleverer piece, entitled 'Supplication directed"
5554,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"to the King's Grace in Contemptioun of Side Tails,' the long trains then"
5555,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"worn by the ladies. It met, we presume,with the fate of _Punch's_ sarcasms"
5556,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"against crinoline,--the 'phylacteries' would for a season, instead of"
5557,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"being lessened, be enlarged, till Fashion lifted up her omnipotent rod,"
5558,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,and told it to be otherwise.
5559,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5560,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"King James died prematurely on the 14th of December 1542, and Lyndsay"
5561,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"closed his eyes at Falkland, and mourned for him as a brother. From that"
5562,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,day forth he probably felt that there was 'less sunshine in the sky for
5563,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"him.' In the troublous times which succeeded this, he had to retire for"
5564,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"a season from the Court, having become obnoxious to the rigid Papists on"
5565,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,account of his writings. After the death of Cardinal Beatoun he wrote
5566,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the tragedy of 'The Cardinal,' a poem in which the spectre of the"
5567,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Cardinal is the spokesman, and which teems with good advice to all and"
5568,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"sundry. The execution, however, is not so felicitous as the plan. In"
5569,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,1548 Lyndsay went to Denmark to negotiate a free trade with Scotland. On
5570,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,his return in 1550 he wrote his very pleasing and chivalric 'History of
5571,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Squire Meldrum,' founded on the actual adventures of William Meldrum,"
5572,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the Laird of Cleish and Binns, a distinguished friend of the poet, who"
5573,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,had gained laurels as a warrior both in Scotland and in France. This
5574,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"poem is, in a measure, an anticipation of the rhymed romances of Scott,"
5575,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,and is full of picturesque description and spirit-stirring adventure. In
5576,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"1553 he completed his last and most elaborate work, which had occupied"
5577,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"him for years, entitled 'The Monarchic,' containing an account of the"
5578,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"most famous monarchies which have existed on earth, and carrying on the"
5579,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,history to the general judgment. From this date we almost entirely lose
5580,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"sight of our poet. He seems to have retired into private life, and is"
5581,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,supposed to have died about the close of 1557. He was probably buried in
5582,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the family vault at Ceres, but no stone marks the spot. Dying without"
5583,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"issue, his estates passed to his brother Alexander, and were continued"
5584,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,in the possession of his descendants till the middle of last century.
5585,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,They now belong to the Hopes of Rankeillour. The office of Lord Lion was
5586,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"held by two of the poet's relatives successively--Sir David, his"
5587,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"nephew, who became Lion King in 1591, and his son-in-law, Sir Jerome"
5588,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Lyndsay, who succeeded to it in 1621."
5589,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5590,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Sir David Lyndsay, unlike most satirists, was a good, a blameless, and a"
5591,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"religious man. The occasional loftiness of his poetic vein, the breadth"
5592,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"of his humour, the purity of his purpose, and his strong reforming zeal"
5593,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,combined to make his poetry exceedingly popular in Scotland for a number
5594,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"of ages, particularly among the lower orders. Scott introduces Andrew"
5595,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Fairservice, in 'Rob Roy,' saying, in reference to Francis Osbaldistone's"
5596,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"poetical efforts, 'Gude help him! twa lines o' Davie Lyndsay wad ding a'"
5597,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"he ever clerkit,' and even still there are districts of the country where"
5598,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,his name is a household word.

5888,MORAL REFLECTIONS ON THE WIND.,"Borde, Bale, Bryan, Annesley, John Rastell, Wilfred Holme, and Charles"
5889,MORAL REFLECTIONS ON THE WIND.,"Bansley, all writers of minor and forgotten poems. John Heywood, called"

6168,"THOMAS SACKVILLE, LORD BUCKHURST AND EARL OF DORSET.",thirty years of age. In the same year (1557) he formed the plan of a

6549,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6550,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6551,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,All hail to Sidney!--the pink of chivalry--the hero of Zutphen--the author
6552,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"of the 'Arcadia,'--the gifted, courteous, genial and noble-minded man! He"
6553,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"was born November 29, 1554, at Penshurst, Kent. His father's name was"
6554,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Henry. He studied at Shrewsbury, at Trinity College, Cambridge, and at"
6555,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Christ Church, Oxford. At the age of eighteen he set out on his travels,"
6556,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"and, in the course of three years, visited France, Flanders, Germany,"
6557,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Hungary, and Italy. On his return he was introduced at Court, and became a"
6558,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"favourite with Queen Elizabeth, who sent him on an embassy to Germany. He"
6559,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"returned home, and shortly after had a quarrel at a tournament with Lord"
6560,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Oxford. But for the interference of the Queen, a duel would have taken"
6561,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"place. Sidney was displeased at the issue of the affair, and retired, in"
6562,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"1580, to Wilton, in Wiltshire, where he wrote his famous 'Arcadia,'--that"
6563,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"true prose-poem, and a work which, with all its faults, no mere sulky and"
6564,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,spoiled child (as some have called him in the matter of this retreat)
6565,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"could ever have produced. This production, written as an outflow of his"
6566,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"mind in its self-sought solitude, was never meant for publication, and did"
6567,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,not appear till after its author's death. As it was written partly for his
6568,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"sister's amusement, he entitled it 'The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia.'"
6569,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"In 1581, Sidney reappeared in Court, and distinguished himself in the"
6570,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,jousts and tournaments celebrated in honour of the Duke of Anjou; and on
6571,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"the return of that prince to the Continent, he accompanied him to Antwerp."
6572,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,In 1583 he received the honour of knighthood. He published about this time
6573,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"a tract entitled 'The Defence of Poesy,' which abounds in the element the"
6574,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"praise of which it celebrates, and which is, besides, distinguished by"
6575,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,acuteness of argument and felicity of expression. In 1585 he was named one
6576,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"of the candidates for the crown of Poland; but Queen Elizabeth, afraid of"
6577,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"'losing the jewel of her times,' prevented him from accepting this honour,"
6578,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,and prevented him also from accompanying Sir Francis Drake on an
6579,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"expedition against the Spanish settlements in America. In the same year,"
6580,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"however, she made him Governor of Flushing, and subsequently General of"
6581,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"the Cavalry, under his uncle, the Earl of Leicester, who commanded the"
6582,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,troops sent to assist the oppressed Dutch Protestants against the
6583,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Spaniards. Here our hero greatly distinguished himself, particularly when"
6584,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"capturing, in 1586, the town of Axel. His career, however, was destined"
6585,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,to be short. On the 22d of September of the same year he accidentally
6586,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,encountered a convoy of the enemy marching toward Zutphen. In the
6587,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"engagement which followed, his party triumphed; but their brave commander"
6588,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"received a shot in the thigh, which shattered the bone. As he was carried"
6589,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"from the field, overcome with thirst, he called for water, but while about"
6590,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"to apply it to his lips, he saw a wounded soldier carried by who was"
6591,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"eagerly eyeing the cup. Sidney, perceiving this, instantly delivered to"
6592,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"him the water, saying, in words which would have made an ordinary man"
6593,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"immortal, but which give Sir Philip a twofold immortality, 'Thy necessity"
6594,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"is greater than mine.' He was carried to Arnheim, and lingered on till"
6595,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"October 17, when he died. He was only thirty-two years of age. His death"
6596,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,was an earthquake at home. All England wore mourning for him. Queen
6597,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Elizabeth ordered his remains to be carried to London, and to receive a"
6598,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"public funeral in St Paul's. He was identified with the land's Poetry,"
6599,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Politeness, and Protestantism; and all who admired any of the three,"
6600,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,sorrowed for Sidney.
6601,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6602,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Sidney's 'Sonnets and other Poems' contain much that is quaint, but also"
6603,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,much that is beautiful and true; yet they are the least poetical of his
6604,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,works. His 'Arcadia' is a glorious unfinished and unpolished wilderness
6605,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"of fancy. It is a vineyard, the scattered clusters of which are so heavy,"
6606,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"that, like the grapes of Eshcol of old, they must be carried on a staff."
6607,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,Here is one of those rich clusters:--
6608,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6609,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"'There were hills, which garnished their proud heights with stately"
6610,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"trees; humble valleys, whose base estate seemed comforted with the"
6611,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"refreshing of silver rivers; meadows, enamelled with all sorts of"
6612,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"eye-pleasing flowers; thickets, which, being lined with most pleasant"
6613,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"shade, were witnessed so, too, by the cheerful disposition of many"
6614,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"well-tuned birds; each pasture stored with sheep, feeding with sober"
6615,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"security; while the pretty lambs, with bleating oratory, craved the"
6616,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"dams' comfort; _here a shepherd's boy, piping as though he should"
6617,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"never be old;_ there a young shepherdess, knitting and withal singing,"
6618,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to work, and her"
6619,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,hands kept time to her voice-music.'
6620,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6621,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"From 'The Defence of Poesy' we could cull, did space permit, a hundred"
6622,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"passages even superior to the above, full of dexterous reasoning, splendid"
6623,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"rhetoric, and subtle fancy, and substantiating all that has been said in"
6624,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"favour of Sir Philip Sidney's accomplishments, chivalric earnestness, and"
6625,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,richly-endowed genius.

6765,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6766,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6767,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Robert Southwell was born in 1560, at St. Faith's, Norfolk. His parents"
6768,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"were Roman Catholics, and sent him when very young to be educated at the"
6769,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"English College of Douay, in Flanders. Thence he went to Borne, and when"
6770,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,sixteen years of age he joined the Society of the Jesuits--a strange bed
6771,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"for the rearing of a poet. In 1585, he was appointed Prefect of Studies,"
6772,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,and was soon after despatched as a missionary of his order to England.
6773,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"There, notwithstanding a law condemning to death all members of his"
6774,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"profession found in this country, he laboured on for eight years,"
6775,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"residing chiefly with Anne, Countess of Arundel, who died afterwards in"
6776,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"the Tower. In July 1592, Southwell was arrested in a gentleman's house"
6777,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,at Uxendon in Middlesex. He was thrust into a dungeon so filthy that
6778,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,when he was brought out to be examined his clothes were covered with
6779,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,vermin. This made his father--a man of good family--petition Queen
6780,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,Elizabeth that if his son was guilty of anything deserving death he
6781,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"might suffer it, but that, meanwhile, being a gentleman, he should be"
6782,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,treated as a gentleman. In consequence of this he was somewhat better
6783,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"lodged, but continued for nearly three years strictly confined to"
6784,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,prison; and as the Queen's agents imagined that he was in the secret of
6785,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"some conspiracies against the Government, he was put to the torture ten"
6786,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"times. In despair, he entreated to be brought to trial, whereupon Cecil"
6787,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"coolly remarked, 'that if he was in such haste to be hanged, he should"
6788,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"quickly have his desire.' On the 20th of February 1595, he was brought"
6789,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"to trial at King's Bench, and having confessed himself a Papist and a"
6790,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Jesuit, he was condemned to death, and executed at Tyburn next day, with"
6791,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,all the nameless barbarities enjoined by the treason laws of these
6792,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,unhappy times. He is believed to have borne all his sufferings with
6793,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"unalterable serenity of mind and sweetness of temper. 'It is fitting,'"
6794,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"says Burke, 'that those made to suffer should suffer well.' And suffer"
6795,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"well throughout all his short life of sorrow, Southwell did."
6796,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6797,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"He was, undoubtedly, although in a false position, a true man, and a"
6798,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"true poet. To hope all things and believe all things, in reference to"
6799,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"a Jesuit, is a difficult task for Protestant charity. Yet what system"
6800,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,so vile but it has sometimes been gloriously misrepresented by its
6801,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,votaries? Who that ever read Edward Irving's 'Preface to Ben Ezra'--that
6802,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,modern Areopagitica--combining the essence of a hundred theological
6803,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,treatises with the spirit and grandeur of a Pindaric or Homeric ode--has
6804,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"forgot the pictures of Ben Ezra, or Lacunza the Jesuit? His work, 'The"
6805,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty,' Irving translated from"
6806,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Spanish into his own noble English prose, and he describes the author as"
6807,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"a man of primitive manners, ardent piety, and enormous erudition, and"
6808,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"expresses a hope, long since we trust fulfilled, of meeting with the"
6809,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,'good old Jesuit' in a better world. To this probably small class of
6810,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"exceptions to a general rule (it surely is no uncharity to say this,"
6811,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,since the annals of Jesuitism have confessedly been so stained with
6812,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"falsehood, treachery, every insidious art, and every detestable crime)"
6813,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,seems to have belonged our poet. No proof was produced that he had any
6814,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"connexion with the treacherous and bloody designs of his party, although"
6815,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,he had plied his priestly labours with unwearied assiduity. He was too
6816,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,sincere-minded a man to have ever been admitted to the darker secrets of
6817,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,the Jesuits.
6818,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6819,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"His verses are ingenious, simpler in style than was common in his time"
6820,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"--distinguished here by homely picturesqueness, and there by solemn"
6821,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"moralising. A shade of deep but serene and unrepining sadness, connected"
6822,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"partly with his position and partly with his foreseen destiny, (his"
6823,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"larger works were written in prison,) rests on the most of his poems."

7056,WARWICK.,When Nature first in hand did take

7059,WARWICK.,"And was compell'd of very force,"
7060,WARWICK.,"With mould in hand, to flee to skies,"
7061,WARWICK.,To end the work she did devise.
7062,WARWICK.,
7063,WARWICK.,"The gods that then in council sate,"
7064,WARWICK.,"Were half-amazed, against their kind,[1]"
7065,WARWICK.,To see so near the stool of state
7066,WARWICK.,"Dame Nature stand, that was assign'd"
7067,WARWICK.,"Among her worldly imps[2] to wonne,[3]"
7068,WARWICK.,As she until that day had done.
7069,WARWICK.,
7070,WARWICK.,"First Jove began: 'What, daughter dear,"
7071,WARWICK.,Hath made thee scorn thy father's will?
7072,WARWICK.,"Why do I see thee, Nature, here,"
7073,WARWICK.,That ought'st of duty to fulfil
7074,WARWICK.,Thy undertaken charge at home?
7075,WARWICK.,What makes thee thus abroad to roam?
7076,WARWICK.,
7077,WARWICK.,"'Disdainful dame, how didst thou dare,"
7078,WARWICK.,So reckless to depart the ground
7079,WARWICK.,That is allotted to thy share?'
7080,WARWICK.,And therewithal his godhead frown'd.
7081,WARWICK.,"'I will,' quoth Nature, 'out of hand,"
7082,WARWICK.,Declare the cause I fled the land.
7083,WARWICK.,
7084,WARWICK.,'I undertook of late a piece
7085,WARWICK.,"Of clay a featured face to frame,"
7086,WARWICK.,"To match the courtly dames of Greece,"

7088,WARWICK.,"But, O good father, now I see"
7089,WARWICK.,This work of mine it will not be.
7090,WARWICK.,
7091,WARWICK.,"'Vicegerent, since you me assign'd"

7093,WARWICK.,"On mortal wights, and will'd that kind"
7094,WARWICK.,"Should make and mar, as she saw cause:"
7095,WARWICK.,"Of right, I think, I may appeal,"
7096,WARWICK.,And crave your help in this to deal.'
7097,WARWICK.,
7098,WARWICK.,"When Jove saw how the case did stand,"
7099,WARWICK.,"And that the work was well begun,"
7100,WARWICK.,He pray'd to have the helping hand
7101,WARWICK.,Of other gods till he had done:
7102,WARWICK.,"With willing minds they all agreed,"
7103,WARWICK.,And set upon the clay with speed.
7104,WARWICK.,
7105,WARWICK.,"First Jove each limb did well dispose,"
7106,WARWICK.,And makes a creature of the clay;
7107,WARWICK.,"Next, Lady Venus she bestows"
7108,WARWICK.,Her gallant gifts as best she may;
7109,WARWICK.,"From face to foot, from top to toe,"
7110,WARWICK.,She let no whit untouch'd to go.
7111,WARWICK.,
7112,WARWICK.,When Venus had done what she could
7113,WARWICK.,"In making of her carcase brave,"
7114,WARWICK.,Then Pallas thought she might be bold
7115,WARWICK.,Among the rest a share to have;
7116,WARWICK.,A passing wit she did convey
7117,WARWICK.,Into this passing piece of clay.
7118,WARWICK.,
7119,WARWICK.,"Of Bacchus she no member had,"
7120,WARWICK.,Save fingers fine and feat[4] to see;
7121,WARWICK.,"Her head with hair Apollo clad,"
7122,WARWICK.,That gods had thought it gold to be:
7123,WARWICK.,So glist'ring was the tress in sight
7124,WARWICK.,Of this new form'd and featured wight.
7125,WARWICK.,
7126,WARWICK.,"Diana held her peace a space,"
7127,WARWICK.,Until those other gods had done;
7128,WARWICK.,"'At last,' quoth she, 'in Dian's chase"
7129,WARWICK.,With bow in hand this nymph shall run;
7130,WARWICK.,And chief of all my noble train
7131,WARWICK.,I will this virgin entertain.'
7132,WARWICK.,
7133,WARWICK.,"Then joyful Juno came and said,"
7134,WARWICK.,"'Since you to her so friendly are,"
7135,WARWICK.,I do appoint this noble maid
7136,WARWICK.,To match with Mars his peer for war;
7137,WARWICK.,"She shall the Countess Warwick be,"
7138,WARWICK.,And yield Diana's bow to me.'
7139,WARWICK.,
7140,WARWICK.,"When to so good effect it came,"
7141,WARWICK.,"And every member had his grace,"
7142,WARWICK.,There wanted nothing but a name:
7143,WARWICK.,"By hap was Mercury then in place,"
7144,WARWICK.,"That said, 'I pray you all agree,"
7145,WARWICK.,Pandora grant her name to be.
7146,WARWICK.,

7148,WARWICK.,"With one assent this noble dame,"
7149,WARWICK.,"And each to her a virtue gave,"
7150,WARWICK.,This term agreeth to the same.'
7151,WARWICK.,The gods that heard Mercurius tell
7152,WARWICK.,"This tale, did like it passing well."
7153,WARWICK.,
7154,WARWICK.,"Report was summon'd then in haste,"
7155,WARWICK.,"And will'd to bring his trump in hand,"
7156,WARWICK.,"To blow therewith a sounding blast,"
7157,WARWICK.,That might be heard through Brutus' land.

7634,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"This remarkable man, from his intimate connexion with Fletcher, is better"

7636,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"descended from an ancient family, which was settled at Grace Dieu in"
7637,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"Leicestershire. He was born in 1585-86, and educated at Cambridge. Thence"
7638,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"he passed to study in the Inner Temple, but seems to have preferred poetry"
7639,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,and the drama to law. He was married to the daughter of Sir Henry Isley of
7640,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"Kent, who bore him two daughters. He died in his 30th year, and was buried"
7641,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"March 9, 1615-16, in St Benedict's Chapel, Westminster Abbey. More of his"

7779,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"The verses attributed to this illustrious man are few, and the"
7780,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"authenticity of some of them is doubtful. No one, however, who has"
7781,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"studied his career, or read his 'History of the World,' can deny him"
7782,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the title of a great poet.
7783,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7784,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"We cannot be expected, in a work of the present kind, to enlarge on a"
7785,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"career so well known as that of Sir Walter Kaleigh. He was born in 1552,"
7786,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"at Hayes Farm, in Devonshire, and descended from an old family there. He"
7787,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"went early to Oxford, but finding its pursuits too tame for his active"
7788,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and enterprising spirit, he left it, and became a soldier at seventeen."
7789,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"For six years he fought on the Protestant side in France, besides serving"
7790,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"a campaign in the Netherlands. In 1579, he went a voyage, which proved"
7791,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"disastrous, to Newfoundland, in company with his half-brother, Sir"
7792,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Humphrey Gilbert. There can be no doubt that this early apprenticeship
7793,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,to war and navigation was of material service to the future explorer and
7794,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"historian. In 1580, he fought in Ireland against the Earl of Desmond,"
7795,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"who had raised a rebellion there, and on one occasion is said to have"
7796,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"defended a ford of Shannon against a whole band of wild Irish rebels,"
7797,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,till the stream ran purple with their blood and his own. With the Lord-
7798,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Deputy, Lord Grey de Wilton, he got into a dispute, and to settle it came"
7799,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"over to England. Here high favour awaited him. His handsome appearance,"
7800,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his graceful address, his ready wit and chivalric courtesy, dashed with"
7801,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"a fine poetic enthusiasm, (see them admirably pictured in 'Kenilworth,')"
7802,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,combined to exalt him in the estimation of Queen Elizabeth. On one
7803,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"occasion he flung his rich plush cloak over a miry part of the way, that"
7804,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,she might pass on unsoiled. By this delicate piece of enacted flattery he
7805,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'spoiled a cloak and made a fortune.' The Queen sent him, along with some"
7806,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"other courtiers, to attend the Duke of Anjou, who had in vain solicited"
7807,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"her hand, back to the Netherlands. In 1584, he fitted two ships, and sent"
7808,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,them out for the discovery and settlement of those parts of North America
7809,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"not already appropriated by Christian states, and the next year there"
7810,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,followed a fleet of seven ships under the command of Sir Richard
7811,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Grenville, Raleigh's kinsman. The attempt to colonise America at that"
7812,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"time failed, but two important things were transplanted through means of"
7813,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the expedition from Virginia to Britain, namely, tobacco and the potato,"
7814,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,--the former of which has ever since been offered up in smoky sacrifice to
7815,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Raleigh's memory throughout the whole world, and the latter of which has"
7816,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,become the most valuable of all our vegetable esculents. Raleigh first
7817,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"planted the potato in Ireland, a country of which it has long been the"
7818,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,principal food. A ludicrous story is told about this. It is said that he
7819,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"had invited a number of his neighbours to an entertainment, in which the"
7820,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"new root was to form a prominent part, but when the feast began Raleigh"
7821,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"found, to his horror, that the servants had boiled the plums, a most"
7822,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"unsavoury mess, and immediately, we suppose, 'tabulae solvuntur risu.'"
7823,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"In 1584 the Queen had knighted him, and shortly after she granted him"
7824,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"certain lucrative monopolies, and an estate in Ireland, in addition to"
7825,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"one he had possessed for some years. In 1588, he was of material service"
7826,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"as one of Her Majesty's Council of War, formed to resist the Spanish"
7827,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Armada, and as one of the volunteers who joined the English fleet with"
7828,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,ships of their own. Next year he accompanied a number of his countrymen
7829,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"in an expedition, which had it in view to restore Don Antonio to the"
7830,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"throne of Portugal, of which the Spaniards had deprived him. On his"
7831,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"return he lost caste considerably, both with the Queen and country, by"
7832,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"taking bribes, and otherwise abusing the influence he had acquired at"
7833,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Court. Yet, about this time, his active mind was projecting what he"
7834,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"called an 'Office of Address,'--a plan for facilitating the designs of"
7835,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"literary and scientific men, promoting intercourse between them, gaining,"
7836,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"in short, all those objects which are now secured by our literary"
7837,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,associations and philosophical societies. Raleigh was eminently a man
7838,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"before his age, but, alas! his age was too far behind him."
7839,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7840,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"While visiting Ireland, after his expedition to Portugal, he contracted"
7841,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"an intimacy with Spenser. (See our 'Life of Spenser,' vol. ii.) In 1592,"
7842,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"he commanded a large naval expedition, destined to attack Panama and"
7843,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"intercept the Spanish Plate-fleet, but was recalled by the Queen, not,"
7844,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"however, till he had seized on an important prize, and, in common"
7845,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"parlance, had 'feathered his nest.' On his return he excited Her"
7846,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Majesty's wrath, by an intrigue with Elizabeth Throgmorton, one of the"
7847,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"maids of honour, and, although Raleigh afterwards married her, the Queen"
7848,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,imprisoned both the offending parties for some months in the Tower.
7849,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Spenser is believed to allude to this in the 4th Book of his great poem.
7850,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"(See vol. in. of our edition, p. 88.) Even after he was released from"
7851,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Tower, Raleigh had to leave the Court in disgrace; instead, however,"
7852,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of wasting time in vain regrets, he undertook, at his own expense, an"
7853,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"expedition against Guiana, where he captured the city of San Joseph, and"
7854,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,which he occupied in the Queen's name. After his return he published an
7855,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"account of his expedition, more distinguished by glowing eloquence than"
7856,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"by rigid regard to truth. In 1596, having in some measure regained the"
7857,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Queen's favour, he was appointed to a command in the expedition against"
7858,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Cadiz, under the Earl of Essex. In this, as well as in the expedition"
7859,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"against the Spanish Plate-fleet the next year, he won laurels, but was"
7860,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,unfortunate enough to excite the jealousy of his Commander-in-Chief.
7861,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"When the favourite got into trouble, Raleigh eagerly joined in the hunt,"
7862,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"wrote a letter to Cecil urging him to the destruction of Essex, and"
7863,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,witnessed his execution from a window in the Armoury. This is
7864,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,undoubtedly a deep blot on the escutcheon of our hero.
7865,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7866,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Cecil had been glad of Raleigh's aid in ruining Essex, but he bore him"
7867,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"no good-will otherwise, and is said to have poisoned James, who now"
7868,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"succeeded to the English throne, against him. Assuredly the new King was"
7869,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"no friend of Raleigh's. Stimulated by Cecil, after first depriving him"
7870,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of his office of Captain of the Guards, he brought him to trial for high"
7871,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"treason. He was accused of conspiring to establish Popery, to dethrone"
7872,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the King, and to put the crown on the head of Arabella Stewart. Sir"
7873,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Edward Coke, the Attorney-General, led the accusation, and disgraced"
7874,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"himself by heaping on Raleigh's head every foul epithet, calling him"
7875,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'viper,' 'damnable atheist,' 'monster,' 'traitor,' 'spider of hell,'"
7876,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"&c., and by his violence, although to his own surprise, as he never"
7877,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"expected to gain his cause in full, he browbeat the jury to bring in a"
7878,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,verdict of high treason.
7879,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7880,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Raleigh's defence was a masterpiece of temper, dignity, strength of"
7881,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"reasoning, and eloquence, and his enemies were ashamed of the decision"
7882,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to which they had driven the jury. He was therefore reprieved, and"
7883,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"committed to the Tower, where his wife was allowed to bear him company,"
7884,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and where his youngest son was born. His estates were, in general,"
7885,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"preserved to him, but Carr, the infamous minion of the King, under some"
7886,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"pretext of a flaw in the conveyance of it by Raleigh to his son, seized"
7887,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,upon his manor of Sherborne. In the Tower he continued for twelve years.
7888,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,These years his industry and genius rendered the happiest probably of
7889,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,his life. Immured in the
7890,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7891,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,"
7892,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"By many a foul and midnight murder fed,'"
7893,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7894,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his winged soul soared away, like the dove of the Deluge, over the wild"
7895,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"ocean of the past. The Tower confined his body, but this great globe the"
7896,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,world seemed too little for the sweep of his spirit. To fill up the vast
7897,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"void which a long imprisonment created around him, and to shew that his"
7898,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"powers retained all their elasticity, he projected a work on the largest"
7899,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"scale, and with the noblest purpose--'The History of the World.' In this"
7900,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,undertaking he found literary men ready to lend him their aid. A hundred
7901,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"hands were generously stretched out to gather materials, and to bring"
7902,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,them to the captive in the Tower. Cart-loads of books were sent. One
7903,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Burrell, formerly his chaplain, assisted him in much of the critical and"
7904,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,chronological drudgery. Rugged Ben Jonson sent in a piece of rugged
7905,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"writing on the Punic War, which Raleigh polished and set as a carved"
7906,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"stone in his magnificent temple. Some have, on this account, sought to"
7907,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,detract from the merit of the author. As if ever an architect could rear
7908,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,a building without hodmen! But in Raleigh's case the hodmen were Titans.
7909,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,'The best wits in England assisted him in his undertaking;' and what a
7910,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,compliment was this to the strength and stature of the master-builder!
7911,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7912,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,This great work was never finished. The part completed comprehended only
7913,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the period from the Creation to the Downfall of the Macedonian Empire
7914,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,--one hundred and seventy years before Christ. He tarries too long amidst
7915,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the misty and mythical ages which precede the dawn of history; his
7916,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"speculations on the site of the original Paradise, on the Flood, &c.,"
7917,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,are more ingenious than instructive; but his descriptions of the Greek
7918,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"battles--his account of the rise of Rome--the extensive erudition, on"
7919,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"all subjects displayed in the book--the many acute, profound, and"
7920,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,eloquently-expressed observations which are sprinkled throughout--and
7921,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the style, massive, dignified, rich, and less involved in structure than"
7922,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,that of almost any of his contemporaries--shall always rank it amongst
7923,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the great literary treasures of the language. It was published in 1614.
7924,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Besides it, Raleigh was the author of various works, all full of"
7925,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"sagacious thought and brilliant imagery, such as 'The Advice to a Son on"
7926,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Choice of a Wife,' 'The Sceptic,' 'Maxims of State,' &c. At last he"
7927,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"was released by the advance of a large sum of money to Villiers, Duke of"
7928,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Buckingham, James's favourite; and, to retrieve his fortunes, projected"
7929,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"another expedition to America. James granted him a patent, under the"
7930,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Great Seal, for making a settlement in Guiana, but ungenerously did not"
7931,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,grant him a pardon for the sentence which had been passed on him for
7932,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"treason. He set sail, 1617, in a ship built by himself, called the"
7933,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"_Destiny_, with eleven other vessels. Having reached the Orinoco, he"
7934,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,despatched a portion of his forces to attack the new Spanish settlement
7935,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of St Thomas. This was captured, with the loss of Raleigh's eldest son."
7936,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"The expected plunder, however, proved of little value; and Sir Walter"
7937,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,having in vain attempted to induce his captains to attack other
7938,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"settlements of the Spaniards, was compelled to return home--his golden"
7939,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dreams dissolved, and his prophetic soul forewarning him of the doom"
7940,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"that awaited him on his native shores. In July 1618, he landed at"
7941,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Plymouth; 'whence,' says Howell, in his 'Familiar Letters,' 'he thought"
7942,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to make an escape, and some say he tampered with his body by physic to"
7943,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"make him look sickly, that he might be the more pitied, and permitted to"
7944,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,lie in his own house.' James was at this time seeking the hand of the
7945,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Infanta for his son Charles, and was naturally disposed to side with the"
7946,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Spanish cause. He was, besides, stirred up by the Spanish ambassador,"
7947,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Count Gondomar, who sent to desire an audience with His Majesty, and"
7948,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"said, that he had only one word to say to him. 'The King wondered what"
7949,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"could be delivered in one word, whereupon, when he came before him, he"
7950,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"said only, ""Pirates! pirates! pirates!"" and so departed.'"
7951,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7952,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Raleigh consequently was arrested and sent back to his old lodgings in
7953,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Tower. He was not tried, as might have been expected, for the new"
7954,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"offence of waging war against a power then at amity with England, but"
7955,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"James, with consummate meanness and cruelty, determined to revive his"
7956,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"former sentence. He was brought before the King's Bench, where his old"
7957,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"enemy, Sir Edward Coke, now sat as Chief Justice, and officially"
7958,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"condemned him to death. His language, however, was considerably modified"
7959,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to the prisoner. He said, 'I know you have been valiant and wise, and I"
7960,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"doubt not but you retain both these virtues, for now you shall have"
7961,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"occasion to use them. Your faith hath heretofore been questioned, but I"
7962,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"am resolved you are a good Christian; for your book, which is an"
7963,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"admirable work, doth testify as much. I would give you counsel, but I"
7964,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,know you can apply unto yourself far better than I can give you. Yet
7965,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"will I (with the good neighbour in the Gospel, who, finding one in the"
7966,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"way wounded and distressed, poured oil into his wounds and refreshed"
7967,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"him) give unto you the oil of comfort, though, in respect that I am a"
7968,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"minister of the law, mixed with vinegar.' Such was Coke's comfort to the"
7969,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,brave and gifted man who stood untrembling before his bar.
7970,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7971,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"On the 26th of October 1618, the day after his condemnation, Raleigh was"
7972,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,beheaded. He met his fate with dignity and composure. Having addressed
7973,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the multitude in vindication of his conduct, he took up the axe, and"
7974,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"said to the sheriff, 'This is a sharp medicine, but a sound cure for all"
7975,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,diseases.' He told the executioner that he would give the signal by
7976,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"lifting up his hand, and 'then,' he said, 'fear not, but strike home.'"
7977,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"He next laid himself down, but was asked by the executioner to alter the"
7978,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"position of the head. 'So the heart be right,' he replied, 'it is no"
7979,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,matter which way the head lies.' The headsman became uncertain and
7980,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"tremulous when the signal was given, whereupon Ealeigh exclaimed, 'Why"
7981,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dost thou not strike? Strike, man!' and by two blows that gallant,"
7982,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"witty, and richly-stored head was severed from the body. He was in his"
7983,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,sixty-fifth year. He had the night before composed the following verse:--
7984,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7985,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Even such is Time, that takes on trust"
7986,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Our youth, our joys, our all we have,"
7987,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,And pays us but with age and dust;
7988,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Who in the dark and silent grave,"
7989,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"When we have wander'd all our ways,"
7990,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Shuts up the story of our days.'
7991,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7992,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Thus perished Sir Walter Raleigh. There has been ever one opinion as to
7993,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the breadth and brilliance of his genius. His powers were almost
7994,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,universal in their range. He commented on Scripture with the ingenuity
7995,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of a Talmudist, and wrote love verses (see the lines in Campbell's"
7996,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'Specimens,' entitled 'Dulcina') with the animus and graceful levity of"
7997,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,a Thomas Moore. He was deep at once in 'all the learning of the
7998,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Egyptians,' and in that of the Greeks and Romans. In his large mind lay"
7999,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dreams of golden lands, which even Australia has not yet fully verified,"
8000,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,alongside of maxims of the most practical wisdom. He was learned in all
8001,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,that had been; well-informed as to all that was; and speculative and
8002,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,hopeful as to all that might be and was yet to be. Disgust at the
8003,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"scholastic methods, blended with the adventurous character of his mind,"
8004,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and perhaps also with some looseness of moral principle, led him at one"
8005,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"time to the brink of universal scepticism; but disappointment, sorrow,"
8006,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and the solitude of the Tower, made him a sadder and wiser man, and he"
8007,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,returned to the verities of the Christian religion. The stains on his
8008,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"character seem to have arisen chiefly from his position. He was, like"
8009,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"some greater and some smaller men of eminence, undoubtedly, to a certain"
8010,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"extent, a brilliant adventurer--a class to whom justice is seldom done,"
8011,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and against whom every calumny is believed. He was a _novus homo_, in an"
8012,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"age of more than common aristocratic pretence; sprang, indeed, from an"
8013,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"ancient family, but possessing nothing himself, save his cloak, his"
8014,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"sword, his tact, and his genius. We all know how, in later times, such"
8015,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"spirits, kindred in many points to Raleigh, in some superior, and in"
8016,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"others inferior--as Burke, Sheridan, and Canning--were used, less for"
8017,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"their errors of temper or of life, than because they had gained immense"
8018,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"influence, not by birth or favour, but by the force of extraordinary"
8019,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"talent and no less remarkable address. Raleigh, however, was undoubtedly"
8020,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,imprudent in a high degree. He had once or twice outraged common
8021,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,morality; his enemies were constantly accusing him of gasconading and of
8022,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'pride.' His success at first was too early and too easy, and hence a"
8023,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,reverse might have been anticipated as certain and as remarkable as his
8024,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,rise had been. His fall ultimately is understood to have been
8025,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"precipitated by the base complicity of James with the Spaniards, who"
8026,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"were informed by the King of Raleigh's motions in America, and prepared"
8027,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to counteract them, as well as by the loud-sounding invectives and legal"
8028,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,lies of the unscrupulous instruments of his tyrannical power. With all
8029,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his faults and follies, (of 'crimes,' it has been justly said, Raleigh"
8030,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"can hardly be accused,) he stood high in that crowd of giants who"
8031,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"illustrated the reign of the Amazonian Queen. What an age it was! Bacon,"
8032,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"with still brighter powers, and far darker and meaner faults than"
8033,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Raleigh, was sitting on the woolsack in body, while his spirit was"
8034,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"presiding over the half-born philosophies of the future, and beholding"
8035,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the cold rod of Induction blossom in an after-day into the Aaronic
8036,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,flowers and fruits of a magnificent science; Cecil was nodding out
8037,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,wisdom or transcendental craft in the Cabinet; Sir Philip Sidney was
8038,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,carrying the spirit of 'Arcadia' into the field of battle; Spenser was
8039,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,dreaming his one beautiful lifelong Dream; and Shakspeare was holding up
8040,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his calm mirror to the heart of man and the universe of nature; while,"
8041,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"on the prow of the British vessel, carrying on those lofty spirits and"
8042,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"enterprises, there appeared a daring mariner, the Poet and 'Shepherd of"
8043,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Ocean,' with bright eye, sanguine countenance, step treading the"
8044,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"deck like a throne, and look contemplating the sunset, as if it were the"
8045,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dawning, and the Evening, as if it were the Morning Star. It was the"
8046,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"hopeful and the brilliant Raleigh, who, while he 'opened up to Europe"
8047,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the New World, was the historian of the Old.' Alas that this illustrious"
8048,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'Marinere' was doomed to a life so troubled and a death so dreadful, and"
8049,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,that the glory of one of England's prodigies is for ever bound up with

8195,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,
8196,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"Joshua Sylvester is the next in the list of our imperfectly-known, but"
8197,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,real poets. Very little is known of his history. He was a merchant-
8198,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"adventurer, and died at Middleburg, aged fifty-five, in 1618. He is said"
8199,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"to have applied, in 1597, for the office of secretary to a trading"
8200,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"company in Stade, and to have been, on this occasion, patronised by"
8201,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,the Earl of Essex. He was at one time attached to the English Court as
8202,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,a pensioner of Prince Henry. He is said to have been driven abroad by
8203,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,the severity of his satires. He seems to have had a sweet flow of
8204,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"conversational eloquence, and hence was called 'The Silver-tongued.' He"
8205,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"was an eminent linguist, and wrote his dedications in various languages."
8206,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"He published a large volume of poems, very unequal in their value, and"
8207,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"inserted in it 'The Soul's Errand,' with interpolations, as we have seen,"
8208,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,which prove it not to be his own. His great work is the translation of
8209,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"the 'Divine Weeks and Works' of the French poet, Du Bartas, which is a"
8210,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,marvellous medley of flatness and force--of childish weakness and soaring
8211,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"genius--with more _seed poetry_ in it than any poem we remember, except"
8212,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"'Festus,' the chaos of a hundred poetic worlds. There can be little doubt"
8213,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"that Milton was familiar with this work in boyhood, and many remarkable"
8214,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,coincidences have been pointed out between it and 'Paradise Lost.'
8215,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"Sylvester was a Puritan, and his publisher, Humphrey Lownes, who lived"
8216,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"in the same street with Milton's father, belonged to the same sect; and,"
8217,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"as Campbell remarks, 'it is easily to be conceived that Milton often"
8218,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"repaired to the shop of Lownes, and there met with the pious didactic"
8219,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"poem.' The work, therefore, some specimens of which we subjoin, is"
8220,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"interesting, both in itself, and as having been the _prima stamina_ of"
8221,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,the great masterpiece of English poetry.

8455,ALEXANDER HUME.,"This Scottish poet was the second son of Patrick, fifth Baron of"
8456,ALEXANDER HUME.,"Polwarth. He was born about the middle of the sixteenth century, and"
8457,ALEXANDER HUME.,"died in 1609. He resided for some years, in the early part of his life,"
8458,ALEXANDER HUME.,"in France. Returning home, he studied law, and then tried his fortune at"
8459,ALEXANDER HUME.,"Court. Here he was eclipsed by a rival, named Montgomery; and after"
8460,ALEXANDER HUME.,"assailing his rival, who rejoined, in verse, he became a clergyman in"
8461,ALEXANDER HUME.,"disgust, and was settled in the parish of Logie. Here he darkened into"
8462,ALEXANDER HUME.,"a sour and savage Calvinist, and uttered an exhortation to the youth of"
8463,ALEXANDER HUME.,"Scotland to forego the admiration of classical heroes, and to read no"
8464,ALEXANDER HUME.,"love-poetry save the 'Song of Solomon.' In another poetic walk, however,"
8465,ALEXANDER HUME.,"that of natural description, Hume excelled, and we print with pleasure"
8466,ALEXANDER HUME.,"some parts of his 'Summer's Day,' which our readers may compare with Mr"

8790,SAMUEL DANIEL.,
8791,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"This ingenious person was born in 1562, near Taunton, in Somersetshire."
8792,SAMUEL DANIEL.,His father was a music-master. He was patronised by the noble family
8793,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"of Pembroke, who probably also maintained him at college. He went to"
8794,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Magdalene Hall, Oxford, in 1579; and after studying there, chiefly"
8795,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"history and poetry, for seven years, he left without a degree. When"
8796,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"twenty-three years of age, he translated Paulus Jovius' 'Discourse of"
8797,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Rare Inventions.' He became tutor to Lady Anne Clifford, the elegant"
8798,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"and accomplished daughter of the Earl of Cumberland. She, at his death,"
8799,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"raised a monument to his memory, and recorded on it, with pride, that"
8800,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"she had been his pupil. After Spenser died, Daniel became a 'voluntary"
8801,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"laureat' to the Court, producing masques and pageants, but was soon"
8802,SAMUEL DANIEL.,supplanted by 'rare Ben Jonson.' In 1603 he was appointed Master of the
8803,SAMUEL DANIEL.,Queen's Revels and Inspector of the Plays to be enacted by juvenile
8804,SAMUEL DANIEL.,performers. He was also promoted to be Gentleman Extraordinary and Groom
8805,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"of the Chambers to the Queen. He was a varied and voluminous writer,"
8806,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"composing plays, miscellaneous poems, and prose compositions, including"
8807,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"a 'Defence of Rhyme' and a 'History of England,'--an honest, but somewhat"
8808,SAMUEL DANIEL.,dry and dull production. While composing his works he resided in Old
8809,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Street, St Luke's, which was then thought a suburban residence; but he"
8810,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"was often in town, and mingled on intimate terms with Selden and"
8811,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Shakspeare. When approaching sixty, he took a farm at Beckington, in"
8812,SAMUEL DANIEL.,Somersetshire--his native shire--and died there in 1619.
8813,SAMUEL DANIEL.,
8814,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Daniel's Plays and History are now, as wholes, forgotten, although the"
8815,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"former contained some vigorous passages, such as Richard II.'s soliloquy"
8816,SAMUEL DANIEL.,on the morning of his murder in Pomfret Castle. His smaller pieces and
8817,SAMUEL DANIEL.,his Sonnets shew no ordinary poetic powers.

8949,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"This knight, says Campbell, 'wrote, at twenty-five years of age, a poem"
8950,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"on the ""Immortality of the Soul,"" and at fifty-two, when he was a judge"
8951,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"and a statesman, another on the ""_Art of Dancing_.""  Well might the"
8952,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"teacher of that noble accomplishment, in Molière's comedy, exclaim, ""_La"
8953,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"philosophie est quelque chose--mais la danse!_""  This, however, is more"
8954,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"pointed than correct, since the first of these poems was written in"
8955,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"1592, when the author was only twenty-two years of age, and the latter"
8956,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"appeared in 1599, when he was only twenty-nine."
8957,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,
8958,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Tisbury, in Wiltshire, was the birthplace of this poet, and 1570 the"
8959,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,date of his birth. His father was a practising lawyer. John was expelled
8960,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"from the Temple for beating one Richard Martyn, afterwards Recorder, but"
8961,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"was restored, and subsequently elected for Parliament. In 1592, as"
8962,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"aforesaid, appeared his poem, 'Nosce Teipsum; or, The Immortality of the"
8963,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Soul.' Its fame soon travelled to Scotland; and when Davies, along with"
8964,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Lord Hunsdon, visited that country, James received him most graciously"
8965,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"as the author of 'Nosce Teipsum.' His history became, for some time, a"
8966,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"list of promotions. He was appointed, in 1603, first Solicitor and then"
8967,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Attorney-General in Ireland, was next made Sergeant, was then knighted,"
8968,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"then appointed King's Sergeant, next elected representative of the"
8969,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"county of Fermanagh, and, in fine, after a violent contest between the"
8970,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Roman Catholic and Protestant parties, was chosen Speaker of the House"
8971,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,of Commons in the Protestant interest. While in Ireland he married
8972,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Eleanor, a daughter of Lord Audley, who turned out a raving prophetess,"
8973,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"and was sent, in 1649, to the Tower, and then to Bethlehem Hospital, by"
8974,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"the Revolutionary Government. In 1616, Sir John returned to England,"
8975,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"continued to practise as a barrister, sat in Parliament for Newcastle-"
8976,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"under-Lyne, and received a promise of being made Chief-Justice of"
8977,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,England; but was suddenly cut off by apoplexy in 1626.

9409,GILES FLETCHER.,"Giles Fletcher was the younger brother of Phineas, and died twenty-three"
9410,GILES FLETCHER.,"years before him. He was a cousin of Fletcher the dramatist, and the son"
9411,GILES FLETCHER.,"of Dr Giles Fletcher, who was employed in many important missions in the"
9412,GILES FLETCHER.,"reign of Queen Elizabeth, and, among others, negotiated a commercial"
9413,GILES FLETCHER.,treaty with Russia greatly in the favour of his own country. Giles is
9414,GILES FLETCHER.,supposed to have been born in 1588. He studied at Cambridge; published his
9415,GILES FLETCHER.,"noble poem, 'Christ's Victory and Triumph,' in 1610, when he was twenty-"
9416,GILES FLETCHER.,"three years of age; was appointed to the living of Alderston, in Suffolk,"
9417,GILES FLETCHER.,"where he died, in 1623, at the early age of thirty-five, 'equally loved,'"
9418,GILES FLETCHER.,"says old Wood, 'of the Muses and the Graces.'"
9419,GILES FLETCHER.,
9420,GILES FLETCHER.,"The poem, in four cantos, entitled 'Christ's Victory and Triumph,' is one"
9421,GILES FLETCHER.,"of almost Miltonic magnificence. With a wing as easy as it is strong, he"
9422,GILES FLETCHER.,"soars to heaven, and fills the austere mouth of Justice and the golden"
9423,GILES FLETCHER.,lips of Mercy with language worthy of both. He then stoops down on the
9424,GILES FLETCHER.,"Wilderness of the Temptation, and paints the Saviour and Satan in colours"
9425,GILES FLETCHER.,"admirably contrasted, and which in their brightness and blackness can"
9426,GILES FLETCHER.,"never decay. Nor does he fear, in fine, to pierce the gloom of Calvary,"
9427,GILES FLETCHER.,"and to mingle his note with the harps of angels, saluting the Redeemer, as"
9428,GILES FLETCHER.,"He sprang from the grave, with the song, 'He is risen, He is risen--and"
9429,GILES FLETCHER.,"shall die no more.' The style is steeped in Spenser--equally mellifluous,"
9430,GILES FLETCHER.,"figurative, and majestic. In allegory the author of the 'Fairy Queen' is"
9431,GILES FLETCHER.,"hardly superior, and in the enthusiasm of devotion Fletcher surpasses him"
9432,GILES FLETCHER.,"far. From the great light, thus early kindled and early quenched, Milton"
9433,GILES FLETCHER.,did not disdain to draw with his 'golden urn.' 'Paradise Regained' owes
9434,GILES FLETCHER.,much more than the suggestion of its subject to 'Christ's Victory;' and is
9435,GILES FLETCHER.,"it too much to say that, had Fletcher lived, he might have shone in the"
9436,GILES FLETCHER.,same constellation with the bard of the 'Paradise Lost?' The plan of our
9437,GILES FLETCHER.,"'Specimens' permits only a few extracts. Let those who wish more, along"
9438,GILES FLETCHER.,"with a lengthened and glowing tribute to the author's genius, consult"
9439,GILES FLETCHER.,_Blackwood_ for November 1835. The reading of a single sentence will
9440,GILES FLETCHER.,convince them that the author of the paper was Christopher North.

9835,JOHN DONNE.,
9836,JOHN DONNE.,"John Donne was born in London, in the year 1573. He sprung from a"
9837,JOHN DONNE.,"Catholic family, and his mother was related to Sir Thomas More and to"
9838,JOHN DONNE.,Heywood the epigrammatist. He was very early distinguished as a prodigy
9839,JOHN DONNE.,"of boyish acquirement, and was entered, when only eleven, of Harthall,"
9840,JOHN DONNE.,"now Hertford College. He was designed for the law, but relinquished the"
9841,JOHN DONNE.,"study when he reached nineteen. About the same time, having studied the"
9842,JOHN DONNE.,"controversies between the Papists and Protestants, he deliberately went"
9843,JOHN DONNE.,"over to the latter. He next accompanied the Earl of Essex to Cadiz, and"
9844,JOHN DONNE.,"looked wistfully over the gulf dividing him from Jerusalem, with all its"
9845,JOHN DONNE.,"holy memories, to which his heart had been translated from very boyhood."
9846,JOHN DONNE.,"He even meditated a journey to the Holy Land, but was discouraged by"
9847,JOHN DONNE.,reports as to the dangers of the way. On his return he was received by
9848,JOHN DONNE.,the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere into his own house as his secretary. Here
9849,JOHN DONNE.,"he fell in love with Miss More, the daughter of Sir George More, Lord-"
9850,JOHN DONNE.,"Lieutenant of the Tower, and the niece of the Chancellor. His passion"
9851,JOHN DONNE.,"was returned, and the pair were imprudent enough to marry privately."
9852,JOHN DONNE.,"When the matter became known, the father-in-law became infuriated. He"
9853,JOHN DONNE.,"prevailed on Lord Ellesmere to drive Donne out of his service, and had"
9854,JOHN DONNE.,him even for a short time imprisoned. Even when released he continued in
9855,JOHN DONNE.,"a pitiable plight, and but for the kindness of Sir Francis Wooley, a son"
9856,JOHN DONNE.,"of Lady Ellesmere by a former marriage, who received the young couple"
9857,JOHN DONNE.,"into his family and entertained them for years, they would have"
9858,JOHN DONNE.,perished.
9859,JOHN DONNE.,
9860,JOHN DONNE.,"When Donne reached the age of thirty-four, Dr Merton, afterwards Bishop"
9861,JOHN DONNE.,"of Durham, urged him to take orders, and offered him a benefice, which"
9862,JOHN DONNE.,"he was generously to relinquish in his favour. Donne declined, on"
9863,JOHN DONNE.,"account, he said, of some past errors of life, which, 'though repented"
9864,JOHN DONNE.,"of and pardoned by God, might not be forgotten by men, and might cast"
9865,JOHN DONNE.,dishonour on the sacred office.'
9866,JOHN DONNE.,
9867,JOHN DONNE.,"When Sir F. Wooley died, Sir Robert Drury became his next protector."
9868,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne attended him on an embassy to France, and his wife formed the"
9869,JOHN DONNE.,romantic purpose of accompanying her husband in the disguise of a page.
9870,JOHN DONNE.,Here was a wife fit for a poet! In order to restrain her from her
9871,JOHN DONNE.,"purpose, he had to address to her some verses, commencing,"
9872,JOHN DONNE.,
9873,JOHN DONNE.,'By our strange and fatal interview.'
9874,JOHN DONNE.,
9875,JOHN DONNE.,"Isaak Walton relates how the poet, one evening, as he sat alone in"
9876,JOHN DONNE.,"Paris, saw his wife appearing to him in vision, with a dead infant in"
9877,JOHN DONNE.,her arms--a proof at once of the strength of his love and of his
9878,JOHN DONNE.,"imagination. This beloved and admirable woman died in 1617, a few days"
9879,JOHN DONNE.,"after giving birth to her twelfth child, and Donne's grief approached"
9880,JOHN DONNE.,distraction.
9881,JOHN DONNE.,
9882,JOHN DONNE.,"When he had reached the forty-second year of his age, our poet, at the"
9883,JOHN DONNE.,"instance of King James, became a clergyman, and was successively"
9884,JOHN DONNE.,"appointed Chaplain to the King, Lecturer to Lincoln's Inn, Dean of St"
9885,JOHN DONNE.,"Dunstan's in the West, and Dean of St Paul's. In the pulpit he attracted"
9886,JOHN DONNE.,"great attention, particularly from the more thoughtful and intelligent"
9887,JOHN DONNE.,"of his auditors. He continued Dean of St Paul's till his death, which"
9888,JOHN DONNE.,"took place in 1631, when he was approaching sixty. He died of consumption,"
9889,JOHN DONNE.,a disease which seldom cuts down a man so near his grand climacteric.
9890,JOHN DONNE.,
9891,JOHN DONNE.,"'He was buried,' says Campbell, 'in St Paul's, where his figure yet"
9892,JOHN DONNE.,"remains in the vault of St Faith's, carved from a painting, for which he"
9893,JOHN DONNE.,"sat a few days' (it should be weeks) 'before his death, dressed in his"
9894,JOHN DONNE.,winding-sheet.' He kept this portrait constantly by his bedside to
9895,JOHN DONNE.,remind him of his mortality.
9896,JOHN DONNE.,
9897,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne's Sermons fill a large folio, with which we were familiar in"
9898,JOHN DONNE.,"boyhood, but have not seen since. De Quincey says, alluding partly"
9899,JOHN DONNE.,"to them, and partly to his poetry,--'Few writers have shewn a more"
9900,JOHN DONNE.,"extraordinary compass of powers than Donne, for he combined--what no"
9901,JOHN DONNE.,other man has ever done--the last sublimation of dialectical subtlety
9902,JOHN DONNE.,and address with the most impassioned majesty. Massy diamonds compose
9903,JOHN DONNE.,"the very substance of his poem on the 'Metempsychosis,'--thoughts and"
9904,JOHN DONNE.,descriptions which have the fervent and gloomy sublimity of Ezekiel or
9905,JOHN DONNE.,Aeschylus; while a diamond-dust of rhetorical brilliances is strewed
9906,JOHN DONNE.,over the whole of his occasional verses and his prose.' We beg leave
9907,JOHN DONNE.,"to differ, in some degree, from De Quincey in his estimate of the"
9908,JOHN DONNE.,"'Metempsychosis,' or 'The Progress of the Soul,' although we have given"
9909,JOHN DONNE.,"it entire. It has too many far-fetched conceits and obscure allegories,"
9910,JOHN DONNE.,"although redeemed, we admit, by some very precious thoughts, such as"
9911,JOHN DONNE.,
9912,JOHN DONNE.,"'This soul, to whom Luther and Mahomet were Prisons of flesh.'"
9913,JOHN DONNE.,
9914,JOHN DONNE.,Or the following quaint picture of the apple in Eden--
9915,JOHN DONNE.,
9916,JOHN DONNE.,"'Prince of the orchard, fair as dawning morn,"
9917,JOHN DONNE.,"Fenced with the law, and ripe as soon as born.'"
9918,JOHN DONNE.,
9919,JOHN DONNE.,Or this--
9920,JOHN DONNE.,
9921,JOHN DONNE.,"'Nature hath no jail, though she hath law.'"
9922,JOHN DONNE.,
9923,JOHN DONNE.,"If our readers, however, can admire the account the poet gives of Abel"
9924,JOHN DONNE.,"and his bitch, or see any resemblance to the severe and simple grandeur"
9925,JOHN DONNE.,of Aeschylus and Ezekiel in the description of the soul informing a
9926,JOHN DONNE.,"body, made of a '_female fish's sandy roe' 'newly leavened with the"
9927,JOHN DONNE.,"male's jelly_,' we shall say no more."
9928,JOHN DONNE.,
9929,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne, altogether, gives us the impression of a great genius ruined by"
9930,JOHN DONNE.,a false system. He is a charioteer run away with by his own pampered
9931,JOHN DONNE.,"steeds. He begins generally well, but long ere the close, quibbles,"
9932,JOHN DONNE.,"conceits, and the temptation of shewing off recondite learning, prove"
9933,JOHN DONNE.,"too strong for him, and he who commenced following a serene star, ends"
9934,JOHN DONNE.,"pursuing a will-o'-wisp into a bottomless morass. Compare, for instance,"
9935,JOHN DONNE.,the ingenious nonsense which abounds in the middle and the close of his
9936,JOHN DONNE.,"'Progress of the Soul' with the dark, but magnificent stanzas which are"
9937,JOHN DONNE.,the first in the poem.
9938,JOHN DONNE.,
9939,JOHN DONNE.,In no writings in the language is there more spilt treasure--a more lavish
9940,JOHN DONNE.,"loss of beautiful, original, and striking things than in the poems of"
9941,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne. Every second line, indeed, is either bad, or unintelligible, or"
9942,JOHN DONNE.,"twisted into unnatural distortion, but even the worst passages discover a"
9943,JOHN DONNE.,"great, though trammelled and tasteless mind; and we question if Dr Johnson"
9944,JOHN DONNE.,"himself, who has, in his 'Life of Cowley,' criticised the school of poets"
9945,JOHN DONNE.,"to which Donne belonged so severely, and in some points so justly,"
9946,JOHN DONNE.,"possessed a tithe of the rich fancy, the sublime intuition, and the lofty"
9947,JOHN DONNE.,spirituality of Donne. How characteristic of the difference between these
9948,JOHN DONNE.,"two great men, that, while the one shrank from the slightest footprint of"
9949,JOHN DONNE.,"death, Donne deliberately placed the image of his dead self before his"
9950,JOHN DONNE.,"eyes, and became familiar with the shadow ere the grim reality arrived!"
9951,JOHN DONNE.,
9952,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne's Satires shew, in addition to the high ideal qualities, the rugged"
9953,JOHN DONNE.,"versification, the fantastic paradox, and the perverted taste of their"
9954,JOHN DONNE.,"author, great strength and clearness of judgment, and a deep, although"
9955,JOHN DONNE.,"somewhat jaundiced, view of human nature. That there must have been"
9956,JOHN DONNE.,something morbid in the structure of his mind is proved by the fact that
9957,JOHN DONNE.,"he wrote an elaborate treatise, which was not published till after his"
9958,JOHN DONNE.,"death, entitled, 'Biathanatos,' to prove that suicide was not necessarily"
9959,JOHN DONNE.,sinful.

10962,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"At such time as the year brings on the pleasant spring,"
10963,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,But hunts-up to the morn the feather'd sylvans sing:
10964,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"And in the lower grove, as on the rising knoll,"
10965,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Upon the highest spray of every mounting pole,"
10966,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Those choristers are perch'd with many a speckled breast.
10967,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Then from her burnish'd gate the goodly glitt'ring east

10975,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"T'awake the lustless sun, or chiding, that so long"
10976,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"He was in coming forth, that should the thickets thrill;"
10977,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"The woosel near at hand, that hath a golden bill;"
10978,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"As nature him had mark'd of purpose, t'let us see"
10979,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,That from all other birds his tunes should different be:
10980,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"For, with their vocal sounds, they sing to pleasant May;"
10981,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Upon his dulcet pipe the merle doth only play.
10982,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"When in the lower brake, the nightingale hard by,"
10983,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"In such lamenting strains the joyful hours doth ply,"
10984,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"As though the other birds she to her tunes would draw,"

11019,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"To our old Arden here, most fitly it belongs:"
11020,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Yet shall she not invoke the muses to her aid;
11021,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"But thee, Diana bright, a goddess and a maid:"

11037,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"On entering of the thick by pressing of the greaves,"
11038,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Where he had gone to lodge. Now when the hart doth hear

11048,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Rechating with his horn, which then the hunter cheers,"

11050,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"His body showing state, with unbent knees upright,"
11051,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Expressing from all beasts, his courage in his flight."
11052,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"But when the approaching foes still following he perceives,"

11054,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"And o'er the champain flies: which when the assembly find,"
11055,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Each follows, as his horse were footed with the wind."
11056,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"But being then imbost, the noble stately deer"
11057,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,When he hath gotten ground (the kennel cast arrear)
11058,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Doth beat the brooks and ponds for sweet refreshing soil:
11059,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"That serving not, then proves if he his scent can foil,"
11060,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"And makes amongst the herds, and flocks of shag-wooled sheep,"
11061,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,Them frighting from the guard of those who had their keep.
11062,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"But when as all his shifts his safety still denies,"
11063,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Put quite out of his walk, the ways and fallows tries."
11064,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Whom when the ploughman meets, his team he letteth stand"

11067,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"When, with tempestuous speed, the hounds and huntsmen follow;"
11068,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Until the noble deer through toil bereaved of strength,"
11069,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"His long and sinewy legs then failing him at length,"
11070,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"The villages attempts, enraged, not giving way"
11071,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,To anything he meets now at his sad decay.
11072,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"The cruel ravenous hounds and bloody hunters near,"
11073,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"This noblest beast of chase, that vainly doth but fear,"
11074,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"Some bank or quickset finds: to which his haunch opposed,"
11075,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"He turns upon his foes, that soon have him enclosed."
11076,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"The churlish-throated hounds then holding him at bay,"
11077,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"And as their cruel fangs on his harsh skin they lay,"

11079,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,
11080,DESCRIPTION OF MORNING.,"The hunter, coming in to help his wearied hounds,"

11095,EDWARD FAIRFAX.,"Fuystone, a place near Knaresborough Forest. Here he spent part of his"
11096,EDWARD FAIRFAX.,"time in managing his elder brother, Lord Fairfax's property, and partly in"
11097,EDWARD FAIRFAX.,"literary pursuits. He wrote a strange treatise on Demonology, a History of"
11098,EDWARD FAIRFAX.,"Edward the Black Prince, which has never been printed, some poor Eclogues,"
11099,EDWARD FAIRFAX.,"and a most beautiful translation of Tasso, which stamps him a true poet as"

11109,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"1  It was the time, when 'gainst the breaking day"
11110,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Rebellious night yet strove, and still repined;"
11111,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"For in the east appear'd the morning gray,"
11112,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And yet some lamps in Jove's high palace shined,"
11113,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"When to Mount Olivet he took his way,"
11114,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And saw, as round about his eyes he twined,"
11115,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Night's shadows hence, from thence the morning's shine;"
11116,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"This bright, that dark; that earthly, this divine:"
11117,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11118,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,2  Thus to himself he thought: 'How many bright
11119,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And splendent lamps shine in heaven's temple high!
11120,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Day hath his golden sun, her moon the night,"

11126,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11127,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"3  Thus as he mused, to the top he went,"
11128,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And there kneel'd down with reverence and fear;

11130,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,His thoughts above all heavens uplifted were--

11133,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Remember not, but let thy mercy fall,"
11134,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And purge my faults and my offences all.'
11135,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11136,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,4  Thus prayed he; with purple wings up-flew
11137,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"In golden weed the morning's lusty queen,"
11138,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Begilding, with the radiant beams she threw,"
11139,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"His helm, his harness, and the mountain green:"
11140,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Upon his breast and forehead gently blew
11141,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The air, that balm and nardus breathed unseen;"
11142,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And o'er his head, let down from clearest skies,"
11143,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,A cloud of pure and precious dew there flies:
11144,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11145,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"5  The heavenly dew was on his garments spread,"
11146,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"To which compared, his clothes pale ashes seem,"
11147,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And sprinkled so, that all that paleness fled,"
11148,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And thence of purest white bright rays outstream:
11149,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"So cheered are the flowers, late withered,"
11150,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,With the sweet comfort of the morning beam;
11151,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And so, return'd to youth, a serpent old"
11152,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Adorns herself in new and native gold.
11153,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11154,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,6  The lovely whiteness of his changed weed
11155,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The prince perceived well and long admired;

11157,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Resolved, as such adventures great required:"
11158,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Thither he came, whence, shrinking back for dread"
11159,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Of that strange desert's sight, the first retired;"
11160,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,But not to him fearful or loathsome made
11161,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"That forest was, but sweet with pleasant shade."
11162,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11163,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"7  Forward he pass'd, and in the grove before"
11164,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"He heard a sound, that strange, sweet, pleasing was;"
11165,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There roll'd a crystal brook with gentle roar,"
11166,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There sigh'd the winds, as through the leaves they pass;"
11167,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There did the nightingale her wrongs deplore,"
11168,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There sung the swan, and singing died, alas!"
11169,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There lute, harp, cittern, human voice, he heard,"
11170,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And all these sounds one sound right well declared.
11171,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11172,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"8  A dreadful thunder-clap at last he heard,"
11173,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The aged trees and plants well-nigh that rent,"
11174,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Yet heard the nymphs and sirens afterward,"
11175,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Birds, winds, and waters, sing with sweet consent;"
11176,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Whereat amazed, he stay'd, and well prepared"
11177,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"For his defence, heedful and slow forth-went;"
11178,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Nor in his way his passage ought withstood,"
11179,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Except a quiet, still, transparent flood:"
11180,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11181,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"9  On the green banks, which that fair stream inbound,"
11182,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Flowers and odours sweetly smiled and smell'd,"
11183,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Which reaching out his stretched arms around,"
11184,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"All the large desert in his bosom held,"
11185,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And through the grove one channel passage found;
11186,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"This in the wood, in that the forest dwell'd:"
11187,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Trees clad the streams, streams green those trees aye made,"
11188,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And so exchanged their moisture and their shade.
11189,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11190,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"10 The knight some way sought out the flood to pass,"
11191,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And as he sought, a wondrous bridge appear'd;"
11192,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"A bridge of gold, a huge and mighty mass,"
11193,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,On arches great of that rich metal rear'd:
11194,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"When through that golden way he enter'd was,"
11195,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Down fell the bridge; swelled the stream, and wear'd"
11196,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The work away, nor sign left, where it stood,"
11197,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And of a river calm became a flood.
11198,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11199,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"11 He turn'd, amazed to see it troubled so,"
11200,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Like sudden brooks, increased with molten snow;"
11201,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The billows fierce, that tossed to and fro,"
11202,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The whirlpools suck'd down to their bosoms low;
11203,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"But on he went to search for wonders mo,[1]"
11204,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Through the thick trees, there high and broad which grow;"
11205,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And in that forest huge, and desert wide,"
11206,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The more he sought, more wonders still he spied:"
11207,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11208,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"12 Where'er he stepp'd, it seem'd the joyful ground"
11209,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Renew'd the verdure of her flowery weed;
11210,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"A fountain here, a well-spring there he found;"
11211,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Here bud the roses, there the lilies spread:"
11212,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The aged wood o'er and about him round
11213,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Flourish'd with blossoms new, new leaves, new seed;"
11214,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And on the boughs and branches of those treen
11215,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The bark was soften'd, and renew'd the green."
11216,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11217,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,13 The manna on each leaf did pearled lie;
11218,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The honey stilled[2] from the tender rind:
11219,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Again he heard that wonderful harmony
11220,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Of songs and sweet complaints of lovers kind;
11221,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The human voices sung a treble high,"
11222,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"To which respond the birds, the streams, the wind;"
11223,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"But yet unseen those nymphs, those singers were,"
11224,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Unseen the lutes, harps, viols which they bear."
11225,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11226,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"14 He look'd, he listen'd, yet his thoughts denied"
11227,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,To think that true which he did hear and see:
11228,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"A myrtle in an ample plain he spied,"
11229,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And thither by a beaten path went he;
11230,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The myrtle spread her mighty branches wide,"
11231,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Higher than pine, or palm, or cypress tree,"
11232,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And far above all other plants was seen
11233,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"That forest's lady, and that desert's queen."
11234,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11235,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"15 Upon the tree his eyes Rinaldo bent,"

11239,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Clad in rare weeds and strange habiliment,"
11240,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"A nymph, for age able to go to man;"
11241,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"An hundred plants beside, even in his sight,"

11388,SIR HENRY WOTTON,"and adroitness. Toward the end of his days, in order to gain the Provost-"

11390,SIR HENRY WOTTON,"72d year of his age. His writings were published in 1651, under the title"
11391,SIR HENRY WOTTON,"of 'Reliquitae Wottonianae,' and Izaak Walton has written an entertaining"
11392,SIR HENRY WOTTON,account of his life. His poetry has a few pleasing and smooth-flowing

11488,RICHARD CORBET.,
11489,RICHARD CORBET.,
11490,RICHARD CORBET.,This witty and good-natured bishop was born in 1582. He was the son of
11491,RICHARD CORBET.,"a gardener, who, however, had the honour to be known to and sung by Ben"
11492,RICHARD CORBET.,Jonson. He was educated at Westminster and Oxford; and having received
11493,RICHARD CORBET.,"orders, was made successively Bishop of Oxford and of Norwich. He was"
11494,RICHARD CORBET.,a most facetious and rather too convivial person; and a collection of
11495,RICHARD CORBET.,"anecdotes about him might be made, little inferior, in point of wit and"
11496,RICHARD CORBET.,"coarseness, to that famous one, once so popular in Scotland, relating to"
11497,RICHARD CORBET.,"the sayings and doings of George Buchanan. He is said, on one occasion,"
11498,RICHARD CORBET.,to have aided an unfortunate ballad-singer in his professional duty by
11499,RICHARD CORBET.,"arraying himself in his leathern jacket and vending the stock, being"
11500,RICHARD CORBET.,"possessed of a fine presence and a clear, full, ringing voice."
11501,RICHARD CORBET.,"Occasionally doffing his clerical costume he adjourned with his chaplain,"
11502,RICHARD CORBET.,"Dr Lushington, to the wine-cellar, where care and ceremony were both"
11503,RICHARD CORBET.,"speedily drowned, the one of the pair exclaiming, 'Here's to thee,"
11504,RICHARD CORBET.,"Lushington,' and the other, 'Here's to thee, Corbet.' Men winked at"
11505,RICHARD CORBET.,"these irregularities, probably on the principle mentioned by Scott, in"
11506,RICHARD CORBET.,"reference to Prior Aymer, in 'Ivanhoe,'--'If Prior Aymer rode hard in"
11507,RICHARD CORBET.,"the chase, or remained late at the banquet, men only shrugged up their"
11508,RICHARD CORBET.,shoulders by recollecting that the same irregularities were practised by
11509,RICHARD CORBET.,"many of his brethren, who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone"
11510,RICHARD CORBET.,"for them.' Corbet, on the other hand, was a kind as well as a convivial"
11511,RICHARD CORBET.,--a warm-hearted as well as an eccentric man. He was tolerant to the
11512,RICHARD CORBET.,Puritans and sectaries; his attention to his duties was respectable; his
11513,RICHARD CORBET.,"talents were of a high order, and he had in him a vein of genius of no"
11514,RICHARD CORBET.,"ordinary kind. He died in 1635, but his poems were not published till"
11515,RICHARD CORBET.,"1647. They are of various merit, and treat of various subjects. In his"
11516,RICHARD CORBET.,"'Journey to France,' you see the humorist, who, on one occasion, when the"
11517,RICHARD CORBET.,"country people were flocking to be confirmed, cried, 'Bear off there, or"
11518,RICHARD CORBET.,"I'll confirm ye with my staff.' In his lines to his son Vincent, we see,"
11519,RICHARD CORBET.,"notwithstanding all his foibles, the good man; and in his 'Farewell to"
11520,RICHARD CORBET.,the Fairies' the fine and fanciful poet.

11754,BEN JONSON.,"in Annandale, having died before his birth. His mother marrying a"
11755,BEN JONSON.,"bricklayer, Ben was brought up to the same employment. Disliking this,"
11756,BEN JONSON.,"he enlisted in the army, and served with credit in the Low Countries."
11757,BEN JONSON.,"When he came home, he entered St John's College, Cambridge; but his stay"

11761,BEN JONSON.,"performer, for which he was committed to prison, but released without"
11762,BEN JONSON.,a trial. He resumed his labours as a writer for the stage; but having
11763,BEN JONSON.,"failed in the acting department, he forsook it for ever. His first hit"
11764,BEN JONSON.,"was, 'Every Man in his Humour,' a play enacted in 1598, Shakspeare being"

11767,BEN JONSON.,"Scottish nation in one of his comedies,--he was appointed in 1619 poet-"
11768,BEN JONSON.,"laureate, with a pension of 100 marks,--he made the same year a journey"

12207,ROBERT BURTON.,
12208,ROBERT BURTON.,"The great, though whimsical author of the 'Anatomy of Melancholy' was"
12209,ROBERT BURTON.,"born at Lindley, in Leicestershire, 1576, and educated at Christ Church,"
12210,ROBERT BURTON.,"Oxford. He became Rector of Seagrave, in his native shire. He was a man"
12211,ROBERT BURTON.,"of vast erudition, of integrity and benevolence, but his happiness,"
12212,ROBERT BURTON.,"like that of Burns, although in a less measure, 'was blasted _ab"
12213,ROBERT BURTON.,origine_ by an incurable taint of hypochondria;' and although at times a
12214,ROBERT BURTON.,"most delightful companion, at other times he was so miserable, even when"
12215,ROBERT BURTON.,"a young student at Oxford, that he had no resource but to go down to the"
12216,ROBERT BURTON.,"river-side, where the coarse jests of the bargemen threw him into fits"
12217,ROBERT BURTON.,"of laughter. This surely was a violent remedy, and one that must have"
12218,ROBERT BURTON.,"reacted into deeper depression. In 1621, he wrote and published, as a"
12219,ROBERT BURTON.,"safety-valve to his morbid feelings, his famous 'Anatomie of Melancholy,"
12220,ROBERT BURTON.,"by Democritus Junior.' It became instantly popular, and sold so well,"
12221,ROBERT BURTON.,that the publisher is said to have made a fortune by it. Nothing more of
12222,ROBERT BURTON.,"consequence is recorded of the author, who died in 1640. Although"
12223,ROBERT BURTON.,
12224,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Melancholy mark'd him for her own,'"
12225,ROBERT BURTON.,
12226,ROBERT BURTON.,she failed to kill him till he had passed his grand climacteric. He was
12227,ROBERT BURTON.,"buried in Christ Church, with the following epitaph, said to have been"
12228,ROBERT BURTON.,composed by himself:--
12229,ROBERT BURTON.,
12230,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Paucis notus, paucioribus ignotus."
12231,ROBERT BURTON.,"Hic jacet Democritus Junior,"
12232,ROBERT BURTON.,Cui vitam pariter et mortem
12233,ROBERT BURTON.,Dedit _Melancholia_!
12234,ROBERT BURTON.,
12235,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Known [by name] to few, unknown [as the author of the ""Anatomy""]"
12236,ROBERT BURTON.,"to fewer, here lies D. J., who owes his death [as a man] and his"
12237,ROBERT BURTON.,life [as an author] to Melancholy.'
12238,ROBERT BURTON.,
12239,ROBERT BURTON.,"His work is certainly a most curious and bewitching medley of thought,"
12240,ROBERT BURTON.,"information, wit, learning, personal interest, and poetic fancy. We all"
12241,ROBERT BURTON.,know it was the only book which ever drew the lazy Johnson from his bed
12242,ROBERT BURTON.,"an hour sooner than he wished to rise. The subject, like the flesh of"
12243,ROBERT BURTON.,"that 'melancholy' creature the hare, may be dry, but, as with that, an"
12244,ROBERT BURTON.,astute cookery prevails to make it exceedingly piquant; the sauce is
12245,ROBERT BURTON.,"better than the substance. Burton's melancholy is not, like Johnson's,"
12246,ROBERT BURTON.,"a deep, hopeless, 'inspissated gloom,' thickened by memories of remorse,"
12247,ROBERT BURTON.,"and lighted up by the lurid fires of feared perdition; it is not, like"
12248,ROBERT BURTON.,"Byron's, dashed with the demoniac element, and fretted into universal"
12249,ROBERT BURTON.,"misanthropy; it is not, like Foster's, the sad, fixed fascination of"
12250,ROBERT BURTON.,"a pure intelligence contemplating the darker side of things, as by a"
12251,ROBERT BURTON.,"necessity of nature, and ignoring, without denying, the existence of the"
12252,ROBERT BURTON.,"bright; nor is it, like that of the 'melancholy Jacques,' in 'As you"
12253,ROBERT BURTON.,"Like it,' a wild, woodland, fantastical habit of thought, as of one"
12254,ROBERT BURTON.,"living collaterally and aside to the world, and which often explodes"
12255,ROBERT BURTON.,into laughter at itself and at all things else;--Burton's is a wide-
12256,ROBERT BURTON.,"spread but tender shade, like twilight, diffused over the whole horizon"
12257,ROBERT BURTON.,"of his thought, and is nourished at times into a luxury, and at times"
12258,ROBERT BURTON.,paraded as a peculiar possession. In his form of melancholy there are
12259,ROBERT BURTON.,"pleasures as well as pains. 'Most pleasant it is,' he says, 'to such"
12260,ROBERT BURTON.,"as are to melancholy given, to lie in bed whole days and keep their"
12261,ROBERT BURTON.,"chambers; to walk alone in some solitary grove, betwixt wood and water,"
12262,ROBERT BURTON.,"by a brook-side, to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant subject;"
12263,ROBERT BURTON.,and a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise and build
12264,ROBERT BURTON.,castles in the air.' Religious considerations have little to do with
12265,ROBERT BURTON.,"Burton's melancholy, and remorse or fear apparently nothing. Hence his"
12266,ROBERT BURTON.,"book, although its theme be sadness, never shadows the spirit, but, on"
12267,ROBERT BURTON.,"the contrary, from his dark, Lethean poppies, his readers are made to"
12268,ROBERT BURTON.,"extract an element of joyful excitement, and the anatomy, and the cure,"
12269,ROBERT BURTON.,"of the evil, are one and the same."
12270,ROBERT BURTON.,
12271,ROBERT BURTON.,"As a writer, Burton ranks, in some points, with Montaigne, and in others"
12272,ROBERT BURTON.,"with Sir Thomas Browne. He resembles the first in simplicity, _bonhommie_,"
12273,ROBERT BURTON.,"and miscellaneous learning, and the other in rambling manner, quaint"
12274,ROBERT BURTON.,"phraseology, and fantastic imagination. Neither of the three could be said"
12275,ROBERT BURTON.,"to write books, but they accumulated vast storehouses, whence thousands of"
12276,ROBERT BURTON.,"volumes might be, and have been compiled. There is nothing in Burton so"
12277,ROBERT BURTON.,"low as in many of the 'Essays' of Montaigne, but there is nothing so lofty"
12278,ROBERT BURTON.,as in passages of Browne's 'Religio Medici' and 'Urn-Burial.' Burton has
12279,ROBERT BURTON.,"been a favourite quarry to literary thieves, among whom Sterne, in his"
12280,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Tristram Shandy,' stands pre-eminent. To his 'Anatomy' he prefixes a poem,"
12281,ROBERT BURTON.,a few stanzas of which we extract.

12567,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12568,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12569,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,This witty baronet was born in 1608. He was the son of the Comptroller
12570,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,of the Household of Charles I. He was uncommonly precocious; at five is
12571,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"said to have spoken Latin, and at sixteen had entered into the service"
12572,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"of Gustavus Adolphus, 'the lion of the North, and the bulwark of the"
12573,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,Protestant faith.'
12574,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12575,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"On his return to England, he was favoured by Charles, and became, in his"
12576,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"turn, a most enthusiastic supporter of the Royal cause; writing plays for"
12577,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"the amusement of the Court; and when the Civil War broke out, raising, at"
12578,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"his own expense of £1200, a regiment for the King, which is said to have"
12579,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,been distinguished only by its 'finery and cowardice.' When the Earl of
12580,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"Strafford came into trouble, Suckling, along with some other cavaliers,"
12581,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"intrigued for his deliverance, was impeached by the House of Commons,"
12582,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,and had to flee to France. Here an early death awaited him. His servant
12583,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"having robbed him, he drew on, in vehement haste, his boots, to pursue"
12584,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"the defaulter, when a rusty nail, or, some say, the blade of a knife,"
12585,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"which was concealed in one of them, pierced his heel. A mortification"
12586,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"ensued, and he died, in 1641, at thirty-three years of age."
12587,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12588,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"Suckling has written five plays, various poems, besides letters,"
12589,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"speeches, and tracts, which have all been collected into one thin volume."
12590,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"They are of various merit; none, in fact, being worthy of print, or at"
12591,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"least of preservation, except one or two of his songs, and his 'Ballad"
12592,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,upon a Wedding'. This last is an admirable expression of what were his
12593,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"principal qualities--_naiveté_, sly humour, gay badinage, and a delicious"

12812,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,
12813,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"Cartwright was born in 1611, and was the son of an innkeeper--once a"
12814,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"gentleman--in Cirencester. He became a King's scholar at Westminster,"
12815,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"and afterwards took orders at Oxford, where he distinguished himself,"
12816,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"according to Wood, as a 'most florid and seraphic preacher.' One is"
12817,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"reminded of the description given of Jeremy Taylor, who, when he first"
12818,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"began to preach, by his 'young and florid beauty, and his sublime and"
12819,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"raised discourses, made men take him for an angel newly descended from"
12820,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"the climes of Paradise.' Cartwright was appointed, through his friend"
12821,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"Bishop Duppa, Succentor of the Church of Salisbury in 1642. He was one"
12822,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"of a council of war appointed by the University of Oxford, for providing"
12823,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"troops in the King's cause, to protect, or some said to overawe, the"
12824,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,Universities. He was imprisoned by the Parliamentary forces on account
12825,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"of his zeal in the Royal cause, but soon liberated on bail. In 1643,"
12826,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"he was appointed Junior Proctor of his University, and also Reader in"
12827,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,Metaphysics. At this time he is said to have studied sixteen hours
12828,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"a-day. This, however, seems to have weakened his constitution, and"
12829,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"rendered him an easy victim to what was called the camp-fever, then"
12830,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"prevalent in Oxford. He died December 23, 1643, aged thirty-two. The"
12831,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"King, then in Oxford, went into mourning for him. His works were"
12832,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"published in 1651, and to them were prefixed fifty copies of encomiastic"
12833,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,verses from the wits and poets of the time. They scarcely justify the
12834,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"praises they have received, being somewhat crude and harsh, and all of"
12835,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"them occasional. His private character, his eloquence as a preacher, and"
12836,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"his zeal as a Royalist, seem to have supplemented his claims as a poet."
12837,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"He enjoyed, too, in his earlier life, the friendship of Ben Jonson, who"
12838,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"used to say of him, 'My son Cartwright writes all like a man;' and such"
12839,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,a sentence from such an authority was at that time fame.

12999,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"a lovely part of a lovely county. He was educated at Oxford, and went"
13000,WILLIAM BROWNE.,thence to the Inner Temple. He was at one time tutor to the Earl of
13001,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Carnarvon, and afterwards, when that nobleman perished in the battle of"
13002,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Newbury, in 1643, he was patronised by the Earl of Pembroke, in whose"
13003,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"house he resided, and is even said to have become so rich that he"
13004,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"purchased an estate. In 1645 he died, at Ottery St Mary, the parish"
13005,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"where, in 1772, Coleridge was born."

13007,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Browne began his poetical career early, and closed it soon. He published"

13009,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"shortly after, his 'Shepherd's Pipe;' and, in 1620, produced his 'Inner"
13010,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Temple Masque' which was then enacted, but not printed till a hundred"

13287,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13288,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13289,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"A man of much finer gifts than Stirling, was the famous Drummond. He"
13290,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"was born, December 13, 1585, at Hawthornden, his father's estate, in"
13291,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Mid- Lothian. It is one of the most beautiful spots, along the sides"
13292,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"of one of the fairest streams in all Scotland, and well fitted to be"
13293,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the home of genius. He studied civil law for four years in France, but,"
13294,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"in 1611, the estate of Hawthornden became his own, and here he fixed his"
13295,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"residence, and applied himself to literature. At this time he courted,"
13296,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"and was upon the point of marrying, a lady named Cunningham, who died;"
13297,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"and the melancholy which preyed on his mind after this event, drove him"
13298,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"abroad in search of solace. He visited Italy, Germany, and France; and"
13299,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"during his eight years of residence on the Continent, used his time"
13300,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"well, conversing with the learned, admiring all that was admirable in"
13301,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the scenery and the life of foreign lands, and collecting rare books and"
13302,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"manuscripts. He had, before his departure, published, first, a volume"
13303,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"of occasional poems; next, a moral treatise, in prose, entitled, 'The"
13304,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Cypress Grove;' and then another work, in verse, 'The Flowers of Zion.'"
13305,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Returned once more to Scotland, he retired to the seat of his brother-"
13306,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"in-law, Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet, and there wrote a 'History of"
13307,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the Five James's of Scotland,' a book abounding in bombast and slavish"
13308,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"principles. When he returned to his own lovely Hawthornden, he met a"
13309,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"lady named Logan, of the house of Restalrig, whom he fancied to bear a"
13310,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"striking resemblance to his dead mistress. On that hint he spake, and"
13311,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"she became his wife. He proceeded to repair the house of Hawthornden,"
13312,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"and would have spent his days there in great peace, had it not been for"
13313,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,the distracted times. His politics were of the Royalist complexion; and
13314,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the party in power, belonging to the Presbyterians, used every method to"
13315,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"annoy him, compelling him, for instance, to furnish his quota of men and"
13316,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"arms to support the cause which he opposed. In 1619, Ben Jonson visited"
13317,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,him at Hawthornden. The pair were not well assorted. Brawny Ben and
13318,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"dreaming Drummond seem, in the expressive coinage of De Quincey, to have"
13319,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"'interdespised;' and is not their feud, with all its circumstances,"
13320,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,recorded in the chronicles of the 'Quarrels of Authors' compiled by the
13321,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,elder Disraeli? The death of a lady sent Drummond travelling over Europe
13322,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,--the death of a King sent him away on a farther and a final journey.
13323,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,His grief for the execution of Charles I. is said to have shortened his
13324,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"days. At all events, in December of the year of the so-called"
13325,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"'Martyrdom,' (1649,) he breathed his last."
13326,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13327,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,He was a genuine poet as well as a brilliant humorist. His 'Polemo
13328,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Middinia,' a grotesque mixture of bad Latin and semi-Latinised Scotch,"
13329,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"has created, among many generations, inextinguishable laughter. His"
13330,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"'Wandering Muses; or, The River of Forth Feasting,' has some gorgeous"
13331,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"descriptions, particularly of Scotland's lakes and rivers, at a time"
13332,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,when

13335,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,Ayont New Holland;'
13336,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13337,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,but his sonnets are unquestionably his finest productions. They breathe
13338,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,a spirit of genuine poetry. Each one of them is a rose lightly wet
13339,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"with the dew of tenderness, and one or two suggest irresistibly the"
13340,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"recollection of our Great Dramatist's sonnets, although we feel that"

14528,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,WILLIAM HABINGTON.
14529,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14530,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14531,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,This poet might have been expected to have belonged to the 'Spasmodic
14532,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"school,' judging by his parental antecedents. His father was accused of"
14533,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"having a share in Babington's conspiracy, but was released because he"
14534,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"was godson to Queen Elizabeth. Soon after, however, he was imprisoned a"
14535,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"second time, and condemned to death on the charge of having concealed"
14536,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,some of the Gunpowder-plot conspirators; but was pardoned through the
14537,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"interest of Lord Morley. His uncle, however, was less fortunate,"
14538,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"suffering death for his complicity with Babington. The poet's mother,"
14539,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"the daughter of Lord Morley, was more loyal than her husband or his"
14540,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"brother, and is said to have written the celebrated letter to Lord"
14541,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Monteagle, in consequence of which the execution of the Gunpowder-plot"
14542,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,was arrested.
14543,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14544,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Our poet was born at Hindlip, Worcestershire, on the very day of the"
14545,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"discovery of the plot, 5th November 1605. The family were Papists, and"
14546,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,William was sent to St Omers to be educated. He was pressed to become
14547,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"a Jesuit, but declined. On his return to England, his father became"
14548,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"preceptor to the poet. As he grew up, instead of displaying any taste"
14549,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"for 'treasons, stratagems, and spoils,' he chose the better part, and"
14550,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"lived a private and happy life. He fell in love with Lucia, daughter of"
14551,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"William Herbert, the first Lord Powis, and celebrated her in his long"
14552,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"and curious poem entitled 'Castara.' This lady he afterwards married,"
14553,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"and from her society appears to have derived much happiness. In 1634,"
14554,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"he published 'Castara.' He also, at different times, produced 'The Queen"
14555,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"of Arragon,' a tragedy; a History of Edward IV.; and 'Observations upon"
14556,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"History.' He died in 1654, (not as Southey, by a strange oversight,"
14557,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"says, 'when he had just completed his fortieth year,') forty-nine years"
14558,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"of age, and was buried in the family vault at Hindlip."
14559,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14560,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"'Castara' is not a consecutive poem, but consists of a great variety of"
14561,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"small pieces, in all sorts of style and rhythm, and of all varieties of"
14562,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"merit; many of them addressed to his mistress under the name of Castara,"
14563,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"and many to his friends; with reflective poems, elegies, and panegyrics,"
14564,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,intermingled with verses sacred to love. Habington is distinguished by
14565,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"purity of tone if not of taste. He has many conceits, but no obscenities."
14566,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"His love is as holy as it is ardent. He has, besides, a vein of sentiment"
14567,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"which sometimes approaches the moral sublime. To prove this, in addition"
14568,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"to the 'Selections' below, we copy some verses entitled--"
14569,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14570,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14571,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,'NOX NOCTI INDICAT SCIENTIAM.'--_David_.

14576,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Doth like an Ethiop bride appear,"
14577,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,

14579,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And heavenward flies,"

14582,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14583,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,For the bright firmament

14599,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"That far-stretch'd power,"

14601,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Is but the triumph of an hour;
14602,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14603,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"That, from the furthest North,"
14604,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Some nation may,"
14605,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Yet undiscover'd, issue forth,"
14606,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And o'er his new-got conquest sway,--"
14607,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14608,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Some nation, yet shut in"
14609,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"With hills of ice,"
14610,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,May be let out to scourge his sin
14611,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Till they shall equal him in vice;
14612,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14613,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,And then they likewise shall
14614,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Their ruin brave;
14615,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"For, as yourselves, your empires fall,"
14616,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,_And every kingdom hath a grave_.
14617,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14618,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Thus those celestial fires,"
14619,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Though seeming mute,"

14621,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And all the pride of life, confute;"
14622,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14623,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,For they have watch'd since first
14624,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"The world had birth,"
14625,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And found sin in itself accurst,"
14626,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,And nothing permanent on earth.
14627,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14628,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
14629,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,There is something to us particularly interesting in the history of this
14630,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,poet. Even as it is pleasant to see the sides of a volcano covered with
14631,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"verdure, and its mouth filled with flowers, so we like to find the"
14632,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"fierce elements, which were inherited by Habington from his fathers,"
14633,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"softened and subdued in him,--the blood of the conspirator mellowed into"
14634,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"that of the gentle bard, who derived all his inspiration from a pure"
14635,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,love and a mild and thoughtful religion.

14846,THE MORNING STAR.,"parish of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, in 1574. He studied and"
14847,THE MORNING STAR.,took orders at Cambridge. He acted for some time as master of the school
14848,THE MORNING STAR.,"of Tiverton, in Devonshire. It is said that the accidental preaching of"
14849,THE MORNING STAR.,a sermon before Prince Henry first attracted attention to this eminent
14850,THE MORNING STAR.,divine. Promotion followed with a sure and steady course. He was chosen
14851,THE MORNING STAR.,"to accompany King James to Scotland as one of his chaplains, and"
14852,THE MORNING STAR.,subsequently attended the famous Synod of Dort as a representative of
14853,THE MORNING STAR.,"the English Church. He had before this, while quite a young man, (in"
14854,THE MORNING STAR.,"1597,) published, under the title of 'Virgidemiarum,' his Satires. In"
14855,THE MORNING STAR.,"the year 1600 he produced a satirical fiction, entitled, 'Mundus alter"
14856,THE MORNING STAR.,"et idem;' in which, while pretending to describe a certain _terra"
14857,THE MORNING STAR.,"australis incognita_, he hits hard at the existent evils of the actual"
14858,THE MORNING STAR.,"world. Hall was subsequently created Bishop of Exeter, where he exposed"
14859,THE MORNING STAR.,"himself to obloquy by his mildness to the Puritans. 'Had,' Campbell"
14860,THE MORNING STAR.,"justly remarked, 'such conduct been, at this critical period, pursued by"
14861,THE MORNING STAR.,"the High Churchmen in general, the history of a bloody age might have"
14862,THE MORNING STAR.,been changed into that of peace; but the violence of Laud prevailed over
14863,THE MORNING STAR.,"the milder counsels of a Hall, an Usher, and a Corbet.' Yet Hall was a"
14864,THE MORNING STAR.,"zealous Episcopalian, and defended that form of government in a variety"
14865,THE MORNING STAR.,of pamphlets. In the course of this controversy he carne in collision
14866,THE MORNING STAR.,"with the mighty Milton himself, who, unable to deny the ability and"
14867,THE MORNING STAR.,"learning of his opponent, tried to cover him with a deluge of derision."
14868,THE MORNING STAR.,
14869,THE MORNING STAR.,"Besides these pamphlets, the Bishop produced a number of Epistles"
14870,THE MORNING STAR.,"in prose, of Sermons, of Paraphrases, and a remarkable series of"
14871,THE MORNING STAR.,"'Occasional Meditations,' which became soon, and continue to be,"
14872,THE MORNING STAR.,popular.
14873,THE MORNING STAR.,
14874,THE MORNING STAR.,"Hall, who had in his early days struggled hard with narrow circumstances"
14875,THE MORNING STAR.,"and neglect, seemed to reach the climax of prosperity when he was, in"
14876,THE MORNING STAR.,"1641, created by the King Bishop of Norwich. But having, soon after,"
14877,THE MORNING STAR.,unfortunately added his name to the Protest of the twelve prelates
14878,THE MORNING STAR.,against the authority of any laws which should be passed during their
14879,THE MORNING STAR.,"compulsory absence from Parliament, he was thrown into the Tower, and"
14880,THE MORNING STAR.,subsequently threatened with sequestration. After enduring great
14881,THE MORNING STAR.,"privations, he at last was permitted to retire to Higham, near Norwich,"
14882,THE MORNING STAR.,"where, reduced to a very miserable allowance, he continued to labour as"
14883,THE MORNING STAR.,"a pastor, with unwearied assiduity, till, in 1656, death closed his"
14884,THE MORNING STAR.,"eyes, at the advanced age of eighty-two. Bishop Hall, if not fully"
14885,THE MORNING STAR.,"competent to mate with Milton, was nevertheless a giant, conspicuous"
14886,THE MORNING STAR.,even in an age when giants were rife. He has been called the Christian
14887,THE MORNING STAR.,"Seneca, from the pith and clear sententiousness of his prose style. His"
14888,THE MORNING STAR.,"'Meditations,' ranging over almost the whole compass of Scripture, as"
14889,THE MORNING STAR.,"well as an incredible variety of ordinary topics, are distinguished by"
14890,THE MORNING STAR.,"their fertile fancy, their glowing language, and by thought which, if"
14891,THE MORNING STAR.,"seldom profound, is never commonplace, and seems always the spontaneous"
14892,THE MORNING STAR.,and easy outcome of the author's mind. In no form of composition does
14893,THE MORNING STAR.,excellence depend more on spontaneity than in the meditation. The ruin
14894,THE MORNING STAR.,"of such writers as Hervey, and, to some extent, Boyle, has been, that"
14895,THE MORNING STAR.,they seem to have set themselves elaborately and convulsively to extract
14896,THE MORNING STAR.,"sentiment out of every object which met their eye. They seem to say,"
14897,THE MORNING STAR.,"'We will, and we must meditate, whether the objects be interesting or"
14898,THE MORNING STAR.,"not, and whether our own moods be propitious to the exercise, or the"
14899,THE MORNING STAR.,"reverse.' Hence have come exaggeration, extravagance, and that shape"
14900,THE MORNING STAR.,"of the ridiculous which mimics the sublime, and has been so admirably"
14901,THE MORNING STAR.,"exposed in Swift's 'Meditation on a Broomstick.' Hall's method is, in"
14902,THE MORNING STAR.,"general, the opposite of this. The objects on which he muses seem to"
14903,THE MORNING STAR.,"have sought him, and not he them. He surrounds himself with his thoughts"
14904,THE MORNING STAR.,"unconsciously, as one gathers burs and other herbage about him by the"
14905,THE MORNING STAR.,"mere act of walking in the woods. Sometimes, indeed, he is quaint and"

14941,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',iniquis_. And he is unquestionably the father of British satire. It is
14942,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',remarkable that all his satires were written in youth. Too often the
14943,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',satirical spirit grows in authors with the advance of life; and it is a

14960,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"ideal, and thus becoming the best as well as the first of our satirical"
14961,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"poets. His style--imitated from Persius and Juvenal--is too elliptical,"
14962,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',and it becomes true of him as well as of Persius that his points are

15169,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15170,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15171,RICHARD LOVELACE.,This unlucky cavalier and bard was born in 1618. He was the son of Sir
15172,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"William Lovelace, of Woolwich, in Kent. He was educated some say at"
15173,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Oxford, and others at Cambridge--took a master's degree, and was"
15174,RICHARD LOVELACE.,afterwards presented at Court. Anthony Wood thus describes his personal
15175,RICHARD LOVELACE.,appearance at the age of sixteen:--'He was the most amiable and
15176,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"beautiful person that eye ever beheld,--a person also of innate modesty,"
15177,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"virtue, and courtly deportment, which made him then, but especially"
15178,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"after when he retired to the great city, much admired and adored by the"
15179,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"fair sex.' Soon after this, he was chosen by the county of Kent to"
15180,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"deliver a petition from the inhabitants to the House of Commons, praying"
15181,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"them to restore the King to his rights, and to settle the government."
15182,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Such offence was given by this to the Long Parliament, that Lovelace was"
15183,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"thrown into prison, and only liberated on heavy bail. His paternal"
15184,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"estate, which amounted to £500 a-year, was soon exhausted in his efforts"
15185,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"to promote the royal cause. In 1646, he formed a regiment for the"
15186,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"service of the King of France, became its colonel, and was wounded at"
15187,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Dunkirk. Ere leaving England, he had formed a strong attachment to a"
15188,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Miss Lucy Sacheverell, and had written much poetry in her praise,"
15189,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"designating her as _Lux-Casta_. Unfortunately, hearing a report that"
15190,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Lovelace had died at Dunkirk of his wounds, she married another, so"
15191,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"that, on his return home in 1648, he met a deep disappointment; and to"
15192,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"complete his misery, the ruling powers cast him again into prison, where"
15193,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"he lay till the death of Charles. Like some other men of genius, he"
15194,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"beguiled his confinement by literary employment; and in 1649, he"
15195,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"published a book under the title of 'Lucasta,' consisting of odes,"
15196,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"sonnets, songs, and miscellaneous poems, most of which had been"
15197,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"previously composed. After the execution of the King, he was liberated;"
15198,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"but his funds were exhausted, his heart broken, and his constitution"
15199,RICHARD LOVELACE.,probably injured. He gradually sunk; and Wood says that he became very
15200,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"poor in body and purse, was the object of charity, 'went in ragged"
15201,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"clothes, and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places.' Alas for the"
15202,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Adonis of sixteen, the beloved of Lucasta, and the envied of all! Some"
15203,RICHARD LOVELACE.,have doubted these stories about his extreme poverty; and one of his
15204,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"biographers asserts, that his daughter and sole heir (but who, pray, was"
15205,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"his wife and her mother?) married the son of Lord Chief-Justice Coke,"
15206,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"and brought to her husband the estates of her father at Kingsdown, in"
15207,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Kent. Aubrey however, corroborates the statements of Wood; and, at all"
15208,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"events, Lovelace seems to have died, in 1658, in a wretched alley near"
15209,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Shoe Lane.
15210,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15211,RICHARD LOVELACE.,There is not much to be said about his poetry. It may be compared to his
15212,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"person--beautiful, but dressed in a stiff mode. We do not, in every"
15213,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"point, homologate the opinions of Prynne, as to the 'unloveliness of"
15214,RICHARD LOVELACE.,love-locks;' but we do certainly look with a mixture of contempt and
15215,RICHARD LOVELACE.,pity on the self-imposed trammels of affectation in style and manner
15216,RICHARD LOVELACE.,which bound many of the poets of that period. The wits of Charles II.
15217,RICHARD LOVELACE.,were more disgustingly licentious; but their very carelessness saved
15218,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"them from the conceits of their predecessors; and, while lowering the"
15219,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"tone of morality, they raised unwittingly the standard of taste. Some of"
15220,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"the songs of Lovelace, however, such as 'To Althea, from Prison,' are"
15221,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"exquisitely simple, as well as pure. Sir Egerton Brydges has found out"
15222,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"that Byron, in one of his be-praised  paradoxical beauties, either"
15223,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"copied, or coincided with, our poet. In the 'Bride of Abydos' he says of"
15224,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Zuleika--
15225,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15226,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"'The mind, the _music_ breathing from her face.'"
15227,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15228,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Lovelace had, long before, in the song of 'Orpheus Mourning for his"
15229,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Wife,' employed the words--"
15230,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15231,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"'Oh, could you view the melody"
15232,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Of every grace,"
15233,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"And _music of her face_,"
15234,RICHARD LOVELACE.,You'd drop a tear;
15235,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Seeing more harmony
15236,RICHARD LOVELACE.,In her bright eye
15237,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Than now you hear.'
15238,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15239,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"While many have praised, others have called this idea nonsense;"
15240,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"although, if we are permitted to speak of the harmony of the tones of a"
15241,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"cloud, why not of the harmony produced by the consenting lines of a"
15242,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"countenance, where every grace melts into another, and the various"
15243,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"features and expressions fluctuate into a fine whole? Whatever, whether"
15244,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"it be the beauty of the human face, or the quiet lustre of statuary, or"
15245,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"the mild glory of moonlight, gives the effects of music, and, like that"
15246,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"divine art,"
15247,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15248,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"'Pours on mortals a beautiful disdain,'"
15249,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
15250,RICHARD LOVELACE.,may surely become music's metaphor and poetic analogy.

15379,ROBERT HERRICK.,ROBERT HERRICK.
15380,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15381,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15382,ROBERT HERRICK.,"This poet--a bird with tropical plumage, and norland sweetness of song"
15383,ROBERT HERRICK.,"--was born in Cheapside, London, in 1591. His father, was an eminent"
15384,ROBERT HERRICK.,goldsmith. Herrick was sent to Cambridge; and having entered into holy
15385,ROBERT HERRICK.,"orders, and being patronised by the Earl of Exeter, he was, in 1629,"
15386,ROBERT HERRICK.,"presented by Charles I. to the vicarage of Dean Prior, in Devonshire."
15387,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Here he resided for twenty years, till ejected by the civil war. He"
15388,ROBERT HERRICK.,seems all this time to have felt little relish either for his profession
15389,ROBERT HERRICK.,"or parishioners. In the former, the cast of his poems shews that he must"
15390,ROBERT HERRICK.,have been 'detained before the Lord;' and the latter he describes as a
15391,ROBERT HERRICK.,"'wild, amphibious race,' rude almost as 'salvages,' and 'churlish as the"
15392,ROBERT HERRICK.,"seas.' When he quitted his charge, he became an author at the mature age"
15393,ROBERT HERRICK.,"of fifty-six--publishing first, in 1647, his 'Noble Numbers; or, Pious"
15394,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Pieces;' and next, in 1648, his 'Hesperides; or, Works both Human and"
15395,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Divine of Robert Herrick, Esq.'--his ministerial prefix being now laid"
15396,ROBERT HERRICK.,aside. Some of these poems were sufficiently unclerical--being wild and
15397,ROBERT HERRICK.,"licentious in cast--although he himself alleges that his life was,"
15398,ROBERT HERRICK.,"sexually at least, blameless. Till the Restoration he lived in Westminster,"
15399,ROBERT HERRICK.,"supported by the rich among the Royalists, and keeping company with the"
15400,ROBERT HERRICK.,popular dramatists and poets. It would seem that he had been in the habit
15401,ROBERT HERRICK.,"of visiting London previously, while still acting as a clergyman, and had"
15402,ROBERT HERRICK.,become a boon companion of Ben Jonson. Hence his well-known lines--
15403,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15404,ROBERT HERRICK.,"'Ah, Ben!"
15405,ROBERT HERRICK.,Say how or when
15406,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Shall we, thy guests,"
15407,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Meet at those lyric feasts,"
15408,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Made at the ""Sun,"""
15409,ROBERT HERRICK.,"The ""Dog,"" the ""Triple Tun,"""
15410,ROBERT HERRICK.,Where we such clusters had
15411,ROBERT HERRICK.,"As made us nobly wild, not mad?"
15412,ROBERT HERRICK.,And yet each verse of thine
15413,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine."
15414,ROBERT HERRICK.,My Ben!
15415,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Or come again,"
15416,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Or send to us,"
15417,ROBERT HERRICK.,Thy wit's great overplus.
15418,ROBERT HERRICK.,But teach us yet
15419,ROBERT HERRICK.,Wisely to husband it;
15420,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Lest we that talent spend,"
15421,ROBERT HERRICK.,And having once brought to an end
15422,ROBERT HERRICK.,"That precious stock, the store"
15423,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Of such a wit, the world should have no more.'"
15424,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15425,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15426,ROBERT HERRICK.,"With the Restoration, fortune began again to smile on our poet. He was"
15427,ROBERT HERRICK.,"replaced in his old charge, and seems to have spent the rest of his life"
15428,ROBERT HERRICK.,"quietly in the country, enjoying the fresh air and the old English"
15429,ROBERT HERRICK.,"sports--'repenting at leisure moments,' as Shakspeare has it, of the"
15430,ROBERT HERRICK.,"early pruriencies of his muse; or, as the same immortal bard says of"
15431,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Falstaff, 'patching up his old body' for a better place. The date of his"
15432,ROBERT HERRICK.,death is not exactly ascertained; but he seems to have got considerably
15433,ROBERT HERRICK.,to the shady side of seventy years of age.
15434,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15435,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Herrick's poetry was for a long time little known, till worthy Nathan"
15436,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Drake, in his 'Literary Hours,' performed to him, as to some others,"
15437,ROBERT HERRICK.,the part of a friendly resurrectionist. He may be called the English
15438,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Anacreon, and resembles the Greek poet, not only in graceful, lively,"
15439,ROBERT HERRICK.,"and voluptuous elegance and richness, but also in that deeper sentiment"
15440,ROBERT HERRICK.,which often underlies the lighter surface of his verse. It is a great
15441,ROBERT HERRICK.,mistake to suppose that Anacreon was a mere contented sensualist and
15442,ROBERT HERRICK.,"shallow songster of love and wine. Some of his odes shew that, if he"
15443,ROBERT HERRICK.,"yielded to the destiny of being a Cicada, singing amidst the vines of"
15444,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Bacchus, it was despair--the despair produced by a degraded age and a"
15445,ROBERT HERRICK.,bad religion--which reduced him to the necessity. He was by nature an
15446,ROBERT HERRICK.,eagle; but he was an eagle in a sky where there was no sun. The cry of
15447,ROBERT HERRICK.,"a noble being, placed in the most untoward circumstances, is here and"
15448,ROBERT HERRICK.,"there heard in his verses, and reminds you of the voice of one of the"
15449,ROBERT HERRICK.,"transmuted victims of Circe, or of Ariel from that cloven pine, where he"
15450,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15451,ROBERT HERRICK.,'howl'd away twelve winters.'
15452,ROBERT HERRICK.,
15453,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Herrick might be by constitution a voluptuary,--and he has unquestionably"
15454,ROBERT HERRICK.,"degraded his genius in not a few of his rhymes,--but in him, as well as"
15455,ROBERT HERRICK.,"in Anacreon, Horace, and Burns, there lay a better and a higher nature,"
15456,ROBERT HERRICK.,"which the critics have ignored, because it has not found a frequent or"
15457,ROBERT HERRICK.,full utterance in his poetry. In proof that our author possessed profound
15458,ROBERT HERRICK.,"sentiment, mingling and sometimes half-lost in the loose, luxuriant"
15459,ROBERT HERRICK.,"leafage of his imagery, we need only refer our readers to his 'Blossoms'"
15460,ROBERT HERRICK.,"and his 'Daffodils.' Besides gaiety and gracefulness, his verse is"
15461,ROBERT HERRICK.,exceedingly musical--his lines not only move but dance.

16101,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16102,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16103,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,The 'melancholy' and musical Cowley was born in London in the year 1618.
16104,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"He was the posthumous son of a worthy grocer, who lived in Fleet Street,"
16105,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"near the end of Chancery Lane, and who is supposed, from the omission of"
16106,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his name in the register of St Dunstan's parish, to have been a"
16107,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Dissenter. His mother was left poor, but had a strong desire for her"
16108,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"son's education, and influence to get him admitted as a king's scholar"
16109,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"into Westminster. His mind was almost preternaturally precocious, and"
16110,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,received early a strong and peculiar stimulus. A copy of Spenser lay in
16111,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the window of his mother's apartment, and in it he delighted to read,"
16112,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,and became the devoted slave of poetry ever after. When only ten he
16113,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"wrote 'The Tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe,' and at twelve"
16114,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,'Constantia and Philetus.' Pope wrote a lampoon about the same age as
16115,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Cowley these romantic narratives; and we have seen a pretty good copy of
16116,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"verses on Napoleon, written at the age of seven, by one of the most"
16117,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,distinguished rising poets of our own day. When fifteen (Johnson calls
16118,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"it thirteen, but he and some other biographers were misled by the"
16119,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"portrait of the poet being, by mistake, marked thirteen) Cowley"
16120,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"published some of his early effusions, under the title of 'Poetical"
16121,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Blossoms.' While at school he produced a comedy of a pastoral kind,"
16122,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"entitled, 'Love's Riddle,' but it was not published till he went to"
16123,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Cambridge. To that university he proceeded in 1636, and two years after,"
16124,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"there appeared the above-mentioned comedy, with a poetical dedication to"
16125,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Sir Kenelm Digby, one of the marvellous men of that age; and also"
16126,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Naufragium Joculare,' a comedy in Latin, inscribed to Dr Comber, master"
16127,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"of the college. When the Prince of Wales afterwards visited Cambridge,"
16128,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the fertile Cowley got up the rough draft of another comedy, called 'The"
16129,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Guardian,' which was repeated to His Royal Highness by the scholars."
16130,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"This was afterwards, to the poet's great annoyance, printed during his"
16131,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"absence from the country. In 1643 he took his degree of A.M., and was,"
16132,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the same year, through the prevailing influence of the Parliament,"
16133,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"ejected, with many others, from Cambridge. He took refuge in St John's"
16134,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"College, Oxford, where he published a satire, entitled 'The Puritan and"
16135,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Papist,' and where, by his loyalty and genius, he gained the favour of"
16136,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,such distinguished courtiers as Lord Falkland. During this agitated
16137,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,period he resided a good deal in the family of the Lord St Albans; and
16138,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,when Oxford fell into the hands of the Parliament he followed the Queen
16139,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to Paris, and there acted as Secretary to the same noble lord. He"
16140,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"remained abroad about ten years, and during that period made various"
16141,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"journeys in the furtherance of the Royal cause, visiting Flanders,"
16142,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Holland, Jersey, Scotland, &c. His chief employment, however, was"
16143,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,carrying on a correspondence in cipher between the King and the Queen.
16144,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Sprat says, 'he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the greatest"
16145,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"part of the letters that passed between their Majesties, and managed a"
16146,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"vast intelligence in other parts, which, for some years together, took"
16147,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,up all his days and two or three nights every week.' This does not seem
16148,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"employment very suitable to a man of genius. He seems, however, to have"
16149,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"found time for more congenial avocations; and, in 1647, he published his"
16150,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Mistress,' a work which seems to glow with amorous fire, although"
16151,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Barnes relates of the author that he was never in love but once, and"
16152,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,then had not resolution to reveal his passion. And yet he wrote 'The
16153,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Chronicle,' from which we might infer that his heart was completely"
16154,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"tinder, and that his series of love attachments had been an infinite"
16155,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,one!
16156,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16157,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"In 1556, being of no more use in Paris, Cowley was sent back to England,"
16158,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,that 'under pretence of privacy and retirement he might take occasion of
16159,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,giving notice of the posture of things in this nation.' For some time he
16160,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"lay concealed in London, but was at length seized by mistake for another"
16161,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"gentleman of the Royal party; and being thus discovered, he was continued"
16162,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"in confinement, was several times examined, and ultimately succeeded,"
16163,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"although with some difficulty, in obtaining his liberation, Dr Scarborough"
16164,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,becoming his bail for a thousand pounds. In the same year he published a
16165,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"collection of his poems, with a querulous preface, in which he expresses"
16166,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"a strong desire to 'retire to some of the American plantations, and to"
16167,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,forsake the world for ever.' Meanwhile he gave himself out as a physician
16168,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"till the death of Cromwell, when he returned to France, resumed his former"
16169,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"occupation, and remained till the Restoration. In 1657 he was created"
16170,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Doctor of Medicine at Oxford. Having studied botany to qualify himself for
16171,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his physician's degree, he was induced to publish in Latin some books on"
16172,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"plants, flowers, and trees."
16173,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16174,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,The Restoration brought him less advantage than he had anticipated.
16175,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Probably he expected too much, and had expressed his sanguine hopes in a"
16176,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"song of triumph on the occasion. He had been promised, both by Charles"
16177,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"I. and Charles II., the Mastership of the Savoy, (a forgotten sinecure"
16178,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"office;) but lost it, says Wood, 'by certain persons, enemies to the"
16179,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Muses.' He brought on the stage at this time his old comedy of 'The
16180,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Guardian,' under the title of 'Cutter of Coleman Street;' but it was"
16181,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"thought a satire on the debauchery of the King's party, and was received"
16182,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"with coldness. Cowley, according to Dryden, 'received the news of his"
16183,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,ill success not with so much firmness as might have been expected from
16184,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"so great a man.' There are few who, like Dr Johnson, have been able to"
16185,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"declare, after the rejection of a play or poem, that they felt 'like the"
16186,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Monument.' Cowley not only entertained, but printed his dissatisfaction,"
16187,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"in the form of a poem called 'The Complaint,' which, like all selfish"
16188,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"complaints, attracted little sympathy or attention. In this he calls"
16189,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"himself the 'melancholy Cowley,' an epithet which has stuck to his"
16190,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,memory.
16191,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16192,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"He had always, according to his own statement, loved retirement. When he"
16193,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"was a young boy at school, instead of running about on holidays, and"
16194,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"playing with his fellows, he was wont to steal from them, and walk into"
16195,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the fields alone with a book. This passion had been overlaid, but not"
16196,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"extinguished, during his public life; and now, swelled by disgust, it"
16197,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"came back upon him in great strength. He seems, too, if we can believe"
16198,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Sprat, to have had an extraordinary attachment to Nature, as it 'was"
16199,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"God's;' to the whole 'compass of the creation, and all the wonderful"
16200,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"effects of the Divine wisdom.' At all events, he retired first to Barn"
16201,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Elms, and then to Chertsey in Surrey. He had obtained, through Lord St"
16202,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Albans and the Duke of Buckingham, the lease of some lands belonging to"
16203,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the Queen, which brought him in an income of £300 a year. Here, then,"
16204,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"having, at the age of forty-two, reached the peaceful hermitage,' he set"
16205,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"himself with all his might to enjoy it. He cultivated his fields, and"
16206,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,renewed his botanical studies in his woods and garden. He wrote letters
16207,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to his friends, which are said to have been admirable, and might have"
16208,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"ranked with those of Gray and Cowper, but unfortunately they have not"
16209,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"been preserved. He renewed his intimacy with the Greek and Latin poets,"
16210,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"and he set himself to retouch the 'Davideis,' which he had begun in"
16211,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"early youth, but which he never lived to finish, and to compose his"
16212,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"beautiful prose essays. But he soon found that Chertsey, no more than"
16213,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Paris, was Paradise. He had no wife nor children. He had sweet solitude,"
16214,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,but no one near him to whom to whisper 'how sweet this solitude is!' The
16215,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"peasants were boors. His tenants would pay him no rent, and the cattle"
16216,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,of his neighbours devoured his meadows. He was troubled with rheums and
16217,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"colds. He met a severe fall when he first came to Chertsey, of which he"
16218,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"says, half in jest and half in earnest--'What this signifies, or may"
16219,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"come to in time, God knows; if it be ominous, it can end in nothing less"
16220,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,than hanging.' Robert Hall said of Bishop Watson that he seemed to have
16221,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"wedded political integrity in early life, and to have spent all the rest"
16222,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,of his days in quarrelling with his wife. So Cowley wedded his long-
16223,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"sought-for bride, Solitude, and led a miserable life with her ever"
16224,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"after. Fortunately for him, if not for the world, his career soon came"
16225,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,to a close.
16226,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16227,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"One hot day in summer, he stayed too long among his labourers in the"
16228,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"meadows, and was seized with a cold, which, being neglected, carried him"
16229,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,off on the 28th of July 1667. He was not forty-nine years old. He died
16230,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"at the Porch House, Chertsey, and his remains were buried with great"
16231,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"pomp near Chaucer and Spenser; and King Charles, who had neglected him"
16232,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"during life, pronounced his panegyric after death, declaring that 'Mr"
16233,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Cowley had not left behind him a better man in England.' It was in
16234,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,keeping with the character of Charles to make up for his deficiency in
16235,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"action, by his felicity of phrase."
16236,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16237,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"If we may differ from such a high authority as 'Old Rowley,' we would"
16238,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,venture to doubt whether Cowley was the best--certainly he was not the
16239,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"greatest--man then in England. Milton was alive, and the 'Paradise Lost'"
16240,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,appeared in the very year when the author of the 'Davideis' departed.
16241,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Cowley gives us the impression of having been an amiable and blameless,"
16242,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"rather than a good or great man. At all events, there was nothing"
16243,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"_active_ in his goodness, and his greatness could not be called"
16244,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,magnanimity. He was a scholar and a poet misplaced during early life;
16245,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"and when he gained that retirement for which he sighed, he had, by his"
16246,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"habits of life, lost his capacity of relishing it. 'He that would enjoy"
16247,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"solitude,' it has been said, 'must either be a wild beast or a god;' and"
16248,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Cowley was neither. How different his grounds of dissatisfaction with
16249,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the world from those of Milton! Cowley was wearied of ciphering, and his"
16250,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,'Cutter of Coleman Street' had been cut; that was nearly the whole
16251,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,matter of his complaint; while Milton had fallen from being the second
16252,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"man in England into poverty, blindness, contempt, danger, and the"
16253,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,disappointment of the most glorious hopes which ever heaved the bosom of
16254,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,patriot or saint.
16255,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16256,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,We find the want of greatness which marked the man characterising the
16257,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"poet. Infinite ingenuity, a charming flexibility and abundance of fancy,"
16258,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"a perception of remote analogies almost unrivalled, great command of"
16259,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"versification and language, learning without bounds, and an occasional"
16260,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,gracefulness and sparkling ease (as in 'The Chronicle') superior to even
16261,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Herrick or Suckling, are qualities that must be conceded to Cowley. But"
16262,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,the most of his writings are cold and glittering as the sun-smitten
16263,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"glacier. He is seldom warm, except when he is proclaiming his own"
16264,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"merits, or bewailing his own misfortunes. Hence his 'Wish,' and even his"
16265,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Complaint,' are very pleasing and natural specimens of poetry. But his"
16266,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Pindaric Odes,' his 'Hymn to Light,' and most of his 'Davideis,' while"
16267,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"displaying great power, shew at least equal perversion, and are more"
16268,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"memorable for their faults than for their beauties. In the 'Davideis,'"
16269,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,he describes the attire of Gabriel in the spirit and language of a
16270,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,tailor; and there is no path so sacred or so lofty but he must sow it
16271,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"with conceits,--forced, false, and chilly. His 'Anacreontics,' on the"
16272,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"other hand, are in general felicitous in style and aerial in motion. And"
16273,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"in his Translations, although too free, he is uniformly graceful and"
16274,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,spirited; and his vast command of language and imagery enables him often
16275,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to improve his author--to gild the refined gold, to paint the lily, and"
16276,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to throw a new perfume on the violet, of the Grecian and Roman masters."
16277,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
16278,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"In prose, Cowley is uniformly excellent. The prefaces to his poems,"
16279,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"especially his defence of sacred song in the prefix to the 'Davideis,'"
16280,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his short autobiography, the fragments of his letters which remain, and"
16281,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his posthumous essays, are all distinguished by a rich simplicity of"
16282,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,style and by a copiousness of matter which excite in equal measure
16283,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"delight and surprise. He had written, it appears, three books on the"
16284,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Civil War, to the time of the battle of Newbury, which he destroyed. It"
16285,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"is a pity, perhaps, that he had not preserved and completed the work."
16286,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,His intimacy with many of the leading characters and the secret springs
16287,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"of that remarkable period,--his clear and solid judgment, always so"
16288,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,except when he was following the Daedalus Pindar upon waxen Icarian
16289,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"wings, or competing with Dr Donne in the number of conceits which he"
16290,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"could stuff, like cloves, into his subject-matter,--and the bewitching"
16291,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"ease and elegance of his prose style, would have combined to render it"
16292,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"an important contribution to English history, and a worthy monument of"
16293,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,its author's highly-accomplished and diversified powers.

17065,THE CONTENTS.,"Gentler than light, yet powerful as a flame:"
17066,THE CONTENTS.,He saw his valour by their safety proved;
17067,THE CONTENTS.,"He saw all this, and as he saw, he loved."
17068,THE CONTENTS.,
17069,THE CONTENTS.,"What art thou, Love! thou great mysterious thing?"
17070,THE CONTENTS.,From what hid stock does thy strange nature spring?
17071,THE CONTENTS.,"'Tis thou that movst the world through every part,"
17072,THE CONTENTS.,"And holdst the vast frame close, that nothing start"
17073,THE CONTENTS.,From the due place and office first ordained;
17074,THE CONTENTS.,"By thee were all things made, and are sustained."
17075,THE CONTENTS.,"Sometimes we see thee fully, and can say"
17076,THE CONTENTS.,"From hence thou tookst thy rise, and wentst that way;"
17077,THE CONTENTS.,But oftener the short beams of Reason's eye
17078,THE CONTENTS.,"See only there thou art, not how, nor why."
17079,THE CONTENTS.,"How is the loadstone, Nature's subtle pride,"
17080,THE CONTENTS.,"By the rude iron woo'd, and made a bride?"
17081,THE CONTENTS.,How was the weapon wounded? what hid flame
17082,THE CONTENTS.,The strong and conquering metal overcame?
17083,THE CONTENTS.,Love (this world's grace) exalts his natural state;
17084,THE CONTENTS.,"He feels thee, Love! and feels no more his weight."
17085,THE CONTENTS.,"Ye learned heads whom ivy garlands grace,"
17086,THE CONTENTS.,Why does that twining plant the oak embrace?
17087,THE CONTENTS.,"The oak, for courtship most of all unfit,"
17088,THE CONTENTS.,And rough as are the winds that fight with it.
17089,THE CONTENTS.,How does the absent pole the needle move?
17090,THE CONTENTS.,How does his cold and ice beget hot love?
17091,THE CONTENTS.,Which are the wings of lightness to ascend?
17092,THE CONTENTS.,Or why does weight to the centre downwards bend?
17093,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus creatures void of life obey thy laws,"
17094,THE CONTENTS.,"And seldom we, they never, know the cause."
17095,THE CONTENTS.,"In thy large state, life gives the next degree,"
17096,THE CONTENTS.,Where sense and good apparent places thee;
17097,THE CONTENTS.,But thy chief palace is man's heart alone;
17098,THE CONTENTS.,Here are thy triumphs and full glories shown:
17099,THE CONTENTS.,"Handsome desires, and rest, about thee flee,"
17100,THE CONTENTS.,"Union, inheritance, zeal, and ecstasy,"
17101,THE CONTENTS.,"With thousand joys, cluster around thine head,"
17102,THE CONTENTS.,O'er which a gall-less dove her wings does spread:
17103,THE CONTENTS.,"A gentle lamb, purer and whiter far"
17104,THE CONTENTS.,"Than consciences of thine own martyrs are,"
17105,THE CONTENTS.,Lies at thy feet; and thy right hand does hold
17106,THE CONTENTS.,The mystic sceptre of a cross of gold.
17107,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus dost thou sit (like men, ere sin had framed"
17108,THE CONTENTS.,"A guilty blush) naked, but not ashamed."
17109,THE CONTENTS.,"What cause, then, did the fab'lous ancients find,"
17110,THE CONTENTS.,When first their superstition made thee blind?
17111,THE CONTENTS.,"'Twas they, alas! 'twas they who could not see,"
17112,THE CONTENTS.,"When they mistook that monster, Lust, for thee."
17113,THE CONTENTS.,"Thou art a bright, but not consuming, flame;"
17114,THE CONTENTS.,"Such in the amazed bush to Moses came,"
17115,THE CONTENTS.,"When that, secure, its new-crown'd head did rear,"
17116,THE CONTENTS.,And chid the trembling branches' needless fear;
17117,THE CONTENTS.,"Thy darts are healthful gold, and downwards fall,"
17118,THE CONTENTS.,Soft as the feathers that they are fletched withal.
17119,THE CONTENTS.,"Such, and no other, were those secret darts"
17120,THE CONTENTS.,Which sweetly touched this noblest pair of hearts:
17121,THE CONTENTS.,"Still to one end they both so justly drew,"
17122,THE CONTENTS.,As courteous doves together yoked would do:
17123,THE CONTENTS.,No weight of birth did on one side prevail;
17124,THE CONTENTS.,Two twins less even lie in Nature's scale:
17125,THE CONTENTS.,"They mingled fates, and both in each did share;"
17126,THE CONTENTS.,"They both were servants, they both princes were."
17127,THE CONTENTS.,"If any joy to one of them was sent,"
17128,THE CONTENTS.,It was most his to whom it least was meant;
17129,THE CONTENTS.,"And Fortune's malice betwixt both was cross'd,"
17130,THE CONTENTS.,"For striking one, it wounded the other most."
17131,THE CONTENTS.,"Never did marriage such true union find,"
17132,THE CONTENTS.,Or men's desires with so glad violence bind;
17133,THE CONTENTS.,"For there is still some tincture left of sin,"
17134,THE CONTENTS.,And still the sex will needs be stealing in.
17135,THE CONTENTS.,"Those joys are full of dross, and thicker far;"
17136,THE CONTENTS.,"These, without matter, clear and liquid are."
17137,THE CONTENTS.,"Such sacred love does heaven's bright spirits fill,"
17138,THE CONTENTS.,"Where love is but to understand and will,"
17139,THE CONTENTS.,With swift and unseen motions such as we
17140,THE CONTENTS.,Somewhat express in heighten'd charity.
17141,THE CONTENTS.,O ye bless'd One! whose love on earth became
17142,THE CONTENTS.,"So pure, that still in heaven 'tis but the same!"
17143,THE CONTENTS.,"There now ye sit, and with mix'd souls embrace,"
17144,THE CONTENTS.,"Gazing upon great Love's mysterious face,"
17145,THE CONTENTS.,"And pity this base world, where friendship's made"
17146,THE CONTENTS.,"A bait for sin, or else at best a trade."
17147,THE CONTENTS.,"Ah, wondrous prince! who a true friend couldst be"
17148,THE CONTENTS.,"When a crown flatter'd, and Saul threaten'd thee!"
17149,THE CONTENTS.,"Who held'st him dear whose stars thy birth did cross,"
17150,THE CONTENTS.,And bought'st him nobly at a kingdom's loss!
17151,THE CONTENTS.,"Israel's bright sceptre far less glory brings,"
17152,THE CONTENTS.,There have been fewer friends on earth than kings.
17153,THE CONTENTS.,
17154,THE CONTENTS.,"To this strong pitch their high affections flew,"
17155,THE CONTENTS.,Till Nature's self scarce looked on them as two.
17156,THE CONTENTS.,"Hither flies David for advice and aid,"
17157,THE CONTENTS.,As swift as love and danger could persuade;
17158,THE CONTENTS.,"As safe in Jonathan's trust his thoughts remain,"
17159,THE CONTENTS.,As when himself but dreams them o'er again.
17160,THE CONTENTS.,
17161,THE CONTENTS.,"'My dearest lord! farewell,' said he, 'farewell;"
17162,THE CONTENTS.,Heaven bless the King; may no misfortune tell
17163,THE CONTENTS.,The injustice of his hate when I am dead:
17164,THE CONTENTS.,They're coming now; perhaps my guiltless head
17165,THE CONTENTS.,"Here, in your sight, must then a-bleeding lie,"
17166,THE CONTENTS.,And scarce your own stand safe for being nigh.
17167,THE CONTENTS.,"Think me not scared with death, howe'er 't appear;"
17168,THE CONTENTS.,I know thou canst not think so: it is a fear
17169,THE CONTENTS.,From which thy love and Dammin speaks me free;
17170,THE CONTENTS.,"I've met him face to face, and ne'er could see"
17171,THE CONTENTS.,One terror in his looks to make me fly
17172,THE CONTENTS.,When virtue bids me stand; but I would die
17173,THE CONTENTS.,"So as becomes my life, so as may prove"
17174,THE CONTENTS.,"Saul's malice, and at least excuse your love.'"
17175,THE CONTENTS.,
17176,THE CONTENTS.,"He stopped, and spoke some passion with his eyes."
17177,THE CONTENTS.,'Excellent friend!' the gallant prince replies;
17178,THE CONTENTS.,"'Thou hast so proved thy virtues, that they're known"
17179,THE CONTENTS.,"To all good men, more than to each his own."
17180,THE CONTENTS.,Who lives in Israel that can doubtful be
17181,THE CONTENTS.,Of thy great actions? for he lives by thee.
17182,THE CONTENTS.,"Such is thy valour, and thy vast success,"
17183,THE CONTENTS.,That all things but thy loyalty are less;
17184,THE CONTENTS.,"And should my father at thy ruin aim,"
17185,THE CONTENTS.,'Twould wound as much his safety as his fame.
17186,THE CONTENTS.,"Think them not coming, then, to slay thee here,"
17187,THE CONTENTS.,But doubt mishaps as little as you fear;
17188,THE CONTENTS.,"For, by thy loving God, whoe'er design"
17189,THE CONTENTS.,"Against thy life, must strike at it through mine,"
17190,THE CONTENTS.,But I my royal father must acquit
17191,THE CONTENTS.,"From such base guilt, or the low thought of it."
17192,THE CONTENTS.,"Think on his softness, when from death he freed"
17193,THE CONTENTS.,The faithless king of Am'lek's cursed seed;
17194,THE CONTENTS.,"Can he t' a friend, t' a son, so bloody grow,"
17195,THE CONTENTS.,He who even sinned but now to spare a foe?
17196,THE CONTENTS.,Admit he could; but with what strength or art
17197,THE CONTENTS.,Could he so long close and seal up his heart?
17198,THE CONTENTS.,"Such counsels jealous of themselves become,"
17199,THE CONTENTS.,And dare not fix without consent of some;
17200,THE CONTENTS.,"Few men so boldly ill great sins to do,"
17201,THE CONTENTS.,Till licensed and approved by others too.
17202,THE CONTENTS.,"No more (believe it) could he hide this from me,"
17203,THE CONTENTS.,"Than I, had he discovered it, from thee.'"
17204,THE CONTENTS.,
17205,THE CONTENTS.,"Here they embraces join, and almost tears,"
17206,THE CONTENTS.,Till gentle David thus new-proved his fears:
17207,THE CONTENTS.,"'The praise you pleased, great prince! on me to spend,"
17208,THE CONTENTS.,"Was all outspoken, when you styled me friend:"
17209,THE CONTENTS.,"That name alone does dangerous glories bring,"
17210,THE CONTENTS.,And gives excuse to the envy of a king.
17211,THE CONTENTS.,"What did his spear, force, and dark plots, impart"
17212,THE CONTENTS.,But some eternal rancour in his heart?
17213,THE CONTENTS.,Still does he glance the fortune of that day
17214,THE CONTENTS.,"When, drowned in his own blood, Goliath lay,"
17215,THE CONTENTS.,And covered half the plain; still hears the sound
17216,THE CONTENTS.,"How that vast monster fell, and strook the around:"
17217,THE CONTENTS.,"The dance, and, David his ten thousand slew,"
17218,THE CONTENTS.,"Still wound his sickly soul, and still are new."
17219,THE CONTENTS.,"Great acts t' ambitious princes treason grow,"
17220,THE CONTENTS.,So much they hate that safety which they owe.
17221,THE CONTENTS.,Tyrants dread all whom they raise high in place;
17222,THE CONTENTS.,"From the good danger, from the bad disgrace."
17223,THE CONTENTS.,"They doubt the lords, mistrust the people's hate,"
17224,THE CONTENTS.,Till blood become a principle of state.
17225,THE CONTENTS.,"Secured not by their guards nor by their right,"
17226,THE CONTENTS.,"But still they fear even more than they affright,"
17227,THE CONTENTS.,"Pardon me, sir; your father's rough and stern;"
17228,THE CONTENTS.,"His will too strong to bend, too proud to learn."
17229,THE CONTENTS.,"Remember, sir, the honey's deadly sting!"
17230,THE CONTENTS.,"Think on that savage justice of the King,"
17231,THE CONTENTS.,When the same day that saw you do before
17232,THE CONTENTS.,"Things above man, should see you man no more."
17233,THE CONTENTS.,"'Tis true, the accursed Agag moved his ruth;"
17234,THE CONTENTS.,He pitied his tall limbs and comely youth;
17235,THE CONTENTS.,"Had seen, alas! the proof of Heaven's fierce hate,"
17236,THE CONTENTS.,And feared no mischief from his powerless fate;
17237,THE CONTENTS.,"Remember how the old seer came raging down,"
17238,THE CONTENTS.,And taught him boldly to suspect his crown.
17239,THE CONTENTS.,"Since then, his pride quakes at the Almighty's rod,"
17240,THE CONTENTS.,Nor dares he love the man beloved by God.
17241,THE CONTENTS.,Hence his deep rage and trembling envy springs;
17242,THE CONTENTS.,Nothing so wild as jealousy of kings.
17243,THE CONTENTS.,"Whom should he counsel ask, with whom advise,"
17244,THE CONTENTS.,Who reason and God's counsel does despise?
17245,THE CONTENTS.,"Whose headstrong will no law or conscience daunt,"
17246,THE CONTENTS.,"Dares he not sin, do you think, without your grant?"
17247,THE CONTENTS.,"Yes, if the truth of our fixed love he knew,"
17248,THE CONTENTS.,"He would not doubt, believe it, to kill even you.'"
17249,THE CONTENTS.,
17250,THE CONTENTS.,"The prince is moved, and straight prepares to find"
17251,THE CONTENTS.,The deep resolves of his grieved father's mind.
17252,THE CONTENTS.,"The danger now appears, love can soon show it,"
17253,THE CONTENTS.,And force his stubborn piety to know it.
17254,THE CONTENTS.,"They agree that David should concealed abide,"
17255,THE CONTENTS.,Till his great friend had the Court's temper tried;
17256,THE CONTENTS.,"Till he had Saul's most sacred purpose found,"
17257,THE CONTENTS.,And searched the depth and rancour of his wound.
17258,THE CONTENTS.,
17259,THE CONTENTS.,"'Twas the year's seventh-born moon; the solemn feast,"
17260,THE CONTENTS.,That with most noise its sacred mirth express'd.
17261,THE CONTENTS.,"From opening morn till night shuts in the day,"
17262,THE CONTENTS.,On trumpets and shrill horns the Levites play:
17263,THE CONTENTS.,Whether by this in mystic type we see
17264,THE CONTENTS.,"The new-year's day of great eternity,"
17265,THE CONTENTS.,"When the changed moon shall no more changes make,"
17266,THE CONTENTS.,And scattered death's by trumpets' sound awake;
17267,THE CONTENTS.,"Or that the law be kept in memory still,"
17268,THE CONTENTS.,Given with like noise on Sinai's shining hill;
17269,THE CONTENTS.,Or that (as some men teach) it did arise
17270,THE CONTENTS.,"From faithful Abram's righteous sacrifice,"
17271,THE CONTENTS.,"Who, whilst the ram on Isaac's fire did fry,"
17272,THE CONTENTS.,His horn with joyful tunes stood sounding by;
17273,THE CONTENTS.,"Obscure the cause, but God his will declared,"
17274,THE CONTENTS.,And all nice knowledge then with ease is spared.
17275,THE CONTENTS.,"At the third hour Saul to the hallowed tent,"
17276,THE CONTENTS.,"'Midst a large train of priests and courtiers, went;"
17277,THE CONTENTS.,"The sacred herd marched proud and softly by,"
17278,THE CONTENTS.,Too fat and gay to think their deaths so nigh.
17279,THE CONTENTS.,Hard fate of beasts more innocent than we!
17280,THE CONTENTS.,Prey to our luxury and our piety!
17281,THE CONTENTS.,"Whose guiltless blood on boards and altars spilt,"
17282,THE CONTENTS.,"Serves both to make and expiate, too, our guilt!"
17283,THE CONTENTS.,"Three bullocks of free neck, two gilded rams,"
17284,THE CONTENTS.,"Two well-washed goats, and fourteen spotless lambs,"
17285,THE CONTENTS.,"With the three vital fruits, wine, oil, and bread,"
17286,THE CONTENTS.,(Small fees to Heaven of all by which we're fed)
17287,THE CONTENTS.,"Are offered up: the hallowed flames arise,"
17288,THE CONTENTS.,And faithful prayers mount with them to the skies.
17289,THE CONTENTS.,"From thence the King to the utmost court is brought,"
17290,THE CONTENTS.,"Where heavenly things an inspired prophet taught,"
17291,THE CONTENTS.,"And from the sacred tent to his palace gates,"
17292,THE CONTENTS.,With glad kind shouts the assembly on him waits;
17293,THE CONTENTS.,"The cheerful horns before him loudly play,"
17294,THE CONTENTS.,And fresh-strewed flowers paint his triumphant way.
17295,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus in slow pace to the palace-hall they go,"
17296,THE CONTENTS.,Rich dressed for solemn luxury and show:
17297,THE CONTENTS.,"Ten pieces of bright tapestry hung the room,"
17298,THE CONTENTS.,"The noblest work e'er stretched on Syrian loom,"
17299,THE CONTENTS.,"For wealthy Adriel in proud Sidon wrought,"
17300,THE CONTENTS.,"And given to Saul when Saul's best gift he sought,"
17301,THE CONTENTS.,The bright-eyed Merab; for that mindful day
17302,THE CONTENTS.,No ornament so proper seemed as they.
17303,THE CONTENTS.,
17304,THE CONTENTS.,"There all old Abram's story you might see,"
17305,THE CONTENTS.,And still some angel bore him company.
17306,THE CONTENTS.,His painful but well-guided travels show
17307,THE CONTENTS.,"The fate of all his sons, the church below."
17308,THE CONTENTS.,Here beauteous Sarah to great Pharaoh came;
17309,THE CONTENTS.,"He blushed with sudden passion, she with shame:"
17310,THE CONTENTS.,"Troubled she seemed, and labouring in the strife,"
17311,THE CONTENTS.,'Twixt her own honour and her husband's life.
17312,THE CONTENTS.,"Here on a conquering host, that careless lay,"
17313,THE CONTENTS.,"Drowned in the joys of their new-gotten prey,"
17314,THE CONTENTS.,The patriarch falls; well-mingled might you see
17315,THE CONTENTS.,The confused marks of death and luxury.
17316,THE CONTENTS.,In the next piece bless'd Salem's mystic king
17317,THE CONTENTS.,Does sacred presents to the victor bring;
17318,THE CONTENTS.,"Like Him whose type he bears, his rights receives,"
17319,THE CONTENTS.,"Strictly requires his due, yet freely gives:"
17320,THE CONTENTS.,"Even in his port, his habit, and his face,"
17321,THE CONTENTS.,"The mild and great, the priest and prince, had place."
17322,THE CONTENTS.,Here all their starry host the heavens display;
17323,THE CONTENTS.,"And, lo! a heavenly youth, more fair than they,"
17324,THE CONTENTS.,"Leads Abram forth; points upwards; 'Such,' said he,"
17325,THE CONTENTS.,'So bright and numberless thy seed shall be.'
17326,THE CONTENTS.,"Here he with God a new alliance makes,"
17327,THE CONTENTS.,And in his flesh the marks of homage takes:
17328,THE CONTENTS.,"Here he the three mysterious persons feasts,"
17329,THE CONTENTS.,Well paid with joyful tidings by his guests:
17330,THE CONTENTS.,"Here for the wicked town he prays, and near,"
17331,THE CONTENTS.,Scarce did the wicked town through flames appear:
17332,THE CONTENTS.,"And all his fate, and all his deeds, were wrought,"
17333,THE CONTENTS.,Since he from Ur to Ephron's cave was brought.
17334,THE CONTENTS.,But none 'mongst all the forms drew then their eyes
17335,THE CONTENTS.,Like faithful Abram's righteous sacrifice:
17336,THE CONTENTS.,"The sad old man mounts slowly to the place,"
17337,THE CONTENTS.,With Nature's power triumphant in his face
17338,THE CONTENTS.,"O'er the mind's courage; for, in spite of all,"
17339,THE CONTENTS.,From his swoln eyes resistless waters fall.
17340,THE CONTENTS.,The innocent boy his cruel burden bore
17341,THE CONTENTS.,"With smiling looks, and sometimes walked before,"
17342,THE CONTENTS.,And sometimes turned to talk: above was made
17343,THE CONTENTS.,"The altar's fatal pile, and on it laid"
17344,THE CONTENTS.,"The hope of mankind: patiently he lay,"
17345,THE CONTENTS.,"And did his sire, as he his God, obey."
17346,THE CONTENTS.,"The mournful sire lifts up at last the knife,"
17347,THE CONTENTS.,"And on one moment's string depends his life,"
17348,THE CONTENTS.,In whose young loins such brooding wonders lie.
17349,THE CONTENTS.,"A thousand sp'rits peeped from the affrighted sky,"
17350,THE CONTENTS.,"Amazed at this strange scene, and almost fear'd,"
17351,THE CONTENTS.,For all those joyful prophecies they'd heard;
17352,THE CONTENTS.,"Till one leaped nimbly forth, by God's command,"
17353,THE CONTENTS.,"Like lightning from a cloud, and stopped his hand."
17354,THE CONTENTS.,The gentle sp'rit smiled kindly as he spoke;
17355,THE CONTENTS.,New beams of joy through Abram's wonder broke
17356,THE CONTENTS.,"The angel points to a tuft of bushes near,"
17357,THE CONTENTS.,"Where an entangled ram does half appear,"
17358,THE CONTENTS.,"And struggles vainly with that fatal net,"
17359,THE CONTENTS.,"Which, though but slightly wrought, was firmly set:"
17360,THE CONTENTS.,"For, lo! anon, to this sad glory doomed,"
17361,THE CONTENTS.,The useful beast on Isaac's pile consumed;
17362,THE CONTENTS.,"Whilst on his horns the ransomed couple played,"
17363,THE CONTENTS.,And the glad boy danced to the tunes he made.
17364,THE CONTENTS.,
17365,THE CONTENTS.,"Near this hall's end a shittim table stood,"
17366,THE CONTENTS.,Yet well-wrought plate strove to conceal the wood;
17367,THE CONTENTS.,"For from the foot a golden vine did sprout,"
17368,THE CONTENTS.,And cast his fruitful riches all about.
17369,THE CONTENTS.,"Well might that beauteous ore the grape express,"
17370,THE CONTENTS.,Which does weak man intoxicate no less.
17371,THE CONTENTS.,"Of the same wood the gilded beds were made,"
17372,THE CONTENTS.,"And on them large embroidered carpets laid,"
17373,THE CONTENTS.,"From Egypt, the rich shop of follies, brought;"
17374,THE CONTENTS.,But arts of pride all nations soon are taught.
17375,THE CONTENTS.,"Behold seven comely blooming youths appear,"
17376,THE CONTENTS.,"And in their hands seven silver washpots bear,"
17377,THE CONTENTS.,"Curled, and gay clad, the choicest sons that be"
17378,THE CONTENTS.,"Of Gibeon's race, and slaves of high degree."
17379,THE CONTENTS.,"Seven beauteous maids marched softly in behind,"
17380,THE CONTENTS.,"Bright scarves their clothes, their hair fresh garlands bind,"
17381,THE CONTENTS.,"And whilst the princes wash, they on them shed"
17382,THE CONTENTS.,"Rich ointments, which their costly odours spread"
17383,THE CONTENTS.,"O'er the whole room; from their small prisons free,"
17384,THE CONTENTS.,With such glad haste through the wide air they flee.
17385,THE CONTENTS.,"The King was placed alone, and o'er his head"
17386,THE CONTENTS.,"A well-wrought heaven of silk and gold was spread,"
17387,THE CONTENTS.,"Azure the ground, the sun in gold shone bright,"
17388,THE CONTENTS.,But pierced the wandering clouds with silver light.
17389,THE CONTENTS.,"The right-hand bed the King's three sons did grace,"
17390,THE CONTENTS.,"The third was Abner's, Adriel's, David's place:"
17391,THE CONTENTS.,"And twelve large tables more were filled below,"
17392,THE CONTENTS.,With the prime men Saul's court and camp could show.
17393,THE CONTENTS.,"The palace did with mirth and music sound,"
17394,THE CONTENTS.,And the crowned goblets nimbly moved around:
17395,THE CONTENTS.,"But though bright joy in every guest did shine,"
17396,THE CONTENTS.,"The plenty, state, music, and sprightful wine,"
17397,THE CONTENTS.,Were lost on Saul: an angry care did dwell
17398,THE CONTENTS.,"In his dark breast, and all gay forms expel."
17399,THE CONTENTS.,"David's unusual absence from the feast,"
17400,THE CONTENTS.,To his sick sp'rit did jealous thoughts suggest:
17401,THE CONTENTS.,"Long lay he still, nor drank, nor ate, nor spoke,"
17402,THE CONTENTS.,And thus at last his troubled silence broke.
17403,THE CONTENTS.,
17404,THE CONTENTS.,'Where can he be?' said he. 'It must be so.'
17405,THE CONTENTS.,With that he paused awhile. 'Too well we know
17406,THE CONTENTS.,"His boundless pride: he grieves, and hates to see"
17407,THE CONTENTS.,The solemn triumphs of my court and me.
17408,THE CONTENTS.,"Believe me, friends! and trust what I can show"
17409,THE CONTENTS.,From thousand proofs; the ambitious David now
17410,THE CONTENTS.,"Does those vast things in his proud soul design,"
17411,THE CONTENTS.,That too much business give for mirth or wine.
17412,THE CONTENTS.,"He's kindling now, perhaps, rebellious fire"
17413,THE CONTENTS.,"Among the tribes, and does even now conspire"
17414,THE CONTENTS.,"Against my crown, and all our lives, whilst we"
17415,THE CONTENTS.,Are loth even to suspect what we might see.
17416,THE CONTENTS.,By the Great Name 'tis true.'
17417,THE CONTENTS.,"With that he strook the board, and no man there,"
17418,THE CONTENTS.,"But Jonathan, durst undertake to clear"
17419,THE CONTENTS.,"The blameless prince: and scarce ten words he spoke,"
17420,THE CONTENTS.,When thus his speech the enraged tyrant broke:
17421,THE CONTENTS.,
17422,THE CONTENTS.,'Disloyal wretch! thy gentle mother's shame!
17423,THE CONTENTS.,"Whose cold, pale ghost even blushes at thy name!"
17424,THE CONTENTS.,"Who fears lest her chaste bed should doubted be,"
17425,THE CONTENTS.,And her white fame stained by black deeds of thee!
17426,THE CONTENTS.,Canst thou be mine? A crown sometimes does hire
17427,THE CONTENTS.,Even sons against their parents to conspire;

17646,THE CONTENTS.,In life's fresh morn his fame did early crow:
17647,THE CONTENTS.,"Fair was the promise of his dawning ray,"

17651,THE CONTENTS.,"So Amaziah lives, so ends his reign,"

17655,THE CONTENTS.,"Down a precipice, deep down he casts them all;"
17656,THE CONTENTS.,The mimic shapes in several postures fall:
17657,THE CONTENTS.,"But then (mad fool!) he does those gods adore,"
17658,THE CONTENTS.,Which when plucked down had worshipped him before.
17659,THE CONTENTS.,Thus all his life to come is loss and shame:

17661,THE CONTENTS.,
17662,THE CONTENTS.,"All this Uzziah's strength and wit repairs,"
17663,THE CONTENTS.,Leaving a well-built greatness to his heirs;

17799,THE CONTENTS.,And with full beams their mingled light devours.
17800,THE CONTENTS.,"An angel straight broke from a shining cloud,"

17846,THE CONTENTS.,
17847,THE CONTENTS.,When Gabriel (no bless'd sp'rit more kind or fair)

17866,THE CONTENTS.,Caught gliding o'er pure streams on which he plays.
17867,THE CONTENTS.,
17868,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus dressed, the joyful Gabriel posts away,"
17869,THE CONTENTS.,And carries with him his own glorious day
17870,THE CONTENTS.,Through the thick woods; the gloomy shades a while
17871,THE CONTENTS.,"Put on fresh, looks, and wonder why they smile;"
17872,THE CONTENTS.,The trembling serpents close and silent lie;

17874,THE CONTENTS.,"A sudden spring waits on him as he goes,"
17875,THE CONTENTS.,Sudden as that which by creation rose.

18437,GEORGE WITHER,
18438,GEORGE WITHER,"This remarkable man was born in Hampshire, at Bentworth, near Alton, in"
18439,GEORGE WITHER,"1588. He was sent to Magdalene College, Oxford, but had hardly been"
18440,GEORGE WITHER,there till his father remanded him home to hold the plough--a reversal
18441,GEORGE WITHER,of the case of Cincinnatus which did not please the aspiring spirit of
18442,GEORGE WITHER,our poet. He took an early opportunity of breaking loose from this
18443,GEORGE WITHER,"occupation, and of going to London with the romantic intention of making"
18444,GEORGE WITHER,"his fortune at Court. Finding that to rise at Court, flattery was"
18445,GEORGE WITHER,"indispensable, and determined not to flatter, he, in 1613, published his"
18446,GEORGE WITHER,"'Abuses Whipt and Stript,' for which he was committed for some months"
18447,GEORGE WITHER,"to the Marshalsea. Here he wrote his beautiful poem, 'The Shepherd's"
18448,GEORGE WITHER,Hunting;' and is said to have gained his manumission by a satire to
18449,GEORGE WITHER,"the King, in which he defends his former writings. Soon after his"
18450,GEORGE WITHER,"liberation, he published his 'Hymns and Songs of the Church,' a book"
18451,GEORGE WITHER,"which embroiled him with the clergy, but procured him the favour of King"
18452,GEORGE WITHER,"James, who encouraged him to finish a translation of the Psalms. He"
18453,GEORGE WITHER,"travelled to the court of the Queen of Bohemia, (James's daughter,) in"
18454,GEORGE WITHER,"fulfilment of a vow, and presented her with a copy of his completed"
18455,GEORGE WITHER,translation.
18456,GEORGE WITHER,
18457,GEORGE WITHER,"In 1639, he was a captain of horse in the expedition against the Scotch."
18458,GEORGE WITHER,"When the Civil War broke out, he sold his estate to raise a troop of"
18459,GEORGE WITHER,"horse on the Parliamentary side, and soon after was made a major. In"
18460,GEORGE WITHER,"1642, he was appointed captain and commander of Farnham Castle, in"
18461,GEORGE WITHER,"Surrey; but owing to some neglect or cowardice on his part, it was ceded"
18462,GEORGE WITHER,the same year to Sir William Waller. He was made prisoner by the
18463,GEORGE WITHER,"Royalists some time after this, and would have been put to death had not"
18464,GEORGE WITHER,"Denham interfered, alleging that as long as Wither survived, he (Denham)"
18465,GEORGE WITHER,could not be accounted the worst poet in England. He was afterwards
18466,GEORGE WITHER,appointed Cromwell's major-general of all the horse and foot in the
18467,GEORGE WITHER,"county of Surrey. He made money at this time by Royalist sequestrations,"
18468,GEORGE WITHER,"but lost it all at the Restoration. He had, on the death of Cromwell,"
18469,GEORGE WITHER,"hailed Richard with enthusiasm, and predicted him a happy reign; which"
18470,GEORGE WITHER,"makes Campbell remark, 'He never but once in his life foreboded good,"
18471,GEORGE WITHER,and in that prophecy he was mistaken.' Wither was by no means pleased
18472,GEORGE WITHER,"with the loss of his fortune, and remonstrated bitterly; but for so"
18473,GEORGE WITHER,doing he was thrown into prison again. Here his mind continued as active
18474,GEORGE WITHER,"as ever, and he poured out treatises, poems, and satires--sometimes,"
18475,GEORGE WITHER,"when pen and ink were denied him, inscribing his thoughts with red ochre"
18476,GEORGE WITHER,"upon a trencher. After three years, he was, in 1663, released from"
18477,GEORGE WITHER,"Newgate, under bond for good behaviour; and four years afterwards he"
18478,GEORGE WITHER,died in London. This was on the 2d of May 1667. He was buried between
18479,GEORGE WITHER,"the east door and the south end of the Savoy church, in the Strand."
18480,GEORGE WITHER,
18481,GEORGE WITHER,"Wither was a man of real genius, but seems to have been partially"
18482,GEORGE WITHER,insane. His political zeal was a frenzy; and his religion was deeply
18483,GEORGE WITHER,tinged with puritanic gloom. His 'Collection of Emblems' never became so
18484,GEORGE WITHER,"popular as those of Quarles, and are now nearly as much forgotten as his"
18485,GEORGE WITHER,"satires, his psalms, and his controversial treatises. But his early"
18486,GEORGE WITHER,"poems are delightful--full of elegant and playful fancy, ease of"
18487,GEORGE WITHER,"language, and delicacy of sentiment. Some passages in 'The Shepherd's"
18488,GEORGE WITHER,"Hunting,' and in the 'Address to Poetry,' resemble the style of Milton"
18489,GEORGE WITHER,in his 'L'Allegro' and 'Penseroso.' His 'Christmas' catches the full
18490,GEORGE WITHER,"spirit of that joyous carnival of Christian England. Altogether, it is"
18491,GEORGE WITHER,refreshing to turn from the gnarled oak of Wither's struggling and
18492,GEORGE WITHER,"unhappy life, to the beautiful flowers, nodding over it, of his poesy."

18865,ROGET.,Is not more loathsome: 'tis a cur will range

18879,ROGET.,"Yet many times he'll much outstrip his bounds,"
18880,ROGET.,And hunts not closely with the other hounds:
18881,ROGET.,He'll venture on a lion in his ire;
18882,ROGET.,"Curst Choler was his dam, and Wrong his sire."
18883,ROGET.,"This Choler is a brach that's very old,"
18884,ROGET.,And spends her mouth too much to have it hold:
18885,ROGET.,"She's very testy, an unpleasing cur,"
18886,ROGET.,"That bites the very stones, if they but stur:"
18887,ROGET.,"Or when that ought but her displeasure moves,"

18893,ROGET.,"The sire, a poor deformed cur, named Fear,"
18894,ROGET.,As shagged and as rough as is a bear:
18895,ROGET.,"And yet the whelp turned after neither kind,"
18896,ROGET.,"For he is very large, and near-hand blind;"
18897,ROGET.,"At the first sight he hath a pretty colour,"
18898,ROGET.,"But doth not seem so, when you view him fuller;"
18899,ROGET.,"A vile suspicious beast, his looks are bad,"
18900,ROGET.,And I do fear in time he will grow mad.
18901,ROGET.,"To him I couple Avarice, still poor;"
18902,ROGET.,Yet she devours as much as twenty more:
18903,ROGET.,"A thousand horse she in her paunch can put,"
18904,ROGET.,Yet whine as if she had an empty gut:
18905,ROGET.,"And having gorged what might a land have found,"
18906,ROGET.,"She'll catch for more, and hide it in the ground."
18907,ROGET.,Ambition is a hound as greedy full;
18908,ROGET.,But he for all the daintiest bits doth cull:

18910,ROGET.,"He'll fetch 't from boards and shelves, if he be able:"
18911,ROGET.,"Nay, he can climb if need be; and for that,"
18912,ROGET.,With him I hunt the martin and the cat:
18913,ROGET.,"And yet sometimes in mounting he's so quick,"
18914,ROGET.,He fetches falls are like to break his neck.
18915,ROGET.,"Fear is well-mouth'd, but subject to distrust;"
18916,ROGET.,A stranger cannot make him take a crust:
18917,ROGET.,"A little thing will soon his courage quail,"
18918,ROGET.,And 'twixt his legs he ever claps his tail;
18919,ROGET.,"With him Despair now often coupled goes,"
18920,ROGET.,Which by his roaring mouth each huntsman knows.
18921,ROGET.,"None hath a better mind unto the game,"
18922,ROGET.,"But he gives off, and always seemeth lame."

19095,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
19096,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
19097,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","The author of 'Gondibert,' was the son of a vintner in Oxford, and born"
19098,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",in February 1605. Gossip says--but says with her usual carelessness about
19099,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","truth--that he was the son of no less a person than William Shakspeare,"
19100,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","who used, in his journeys between London and Stratford, to stop at the"
19101,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Crown, an inn kept by Davenant's reputed father. This story is hinted at"
19102,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","by Wood, was told to Pope by Betterton the player, and believed by Malone,"
19103,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",but seems to be a piece of mere scandal. It is true that Davenant had a
19104,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","great veneration for Shakspeare, and expressed it, when only ten years"
19105,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","old, in lines 'In remembrance of Master William Shakspeare,' beginning"
19106,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",thus:--
19107,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
19108,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","'Beware, delighted poets, when you sing,"
19109,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","To welcome nature in the early spring,"
19110,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Your numerous feet not tread
19111,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","The banks of Avon, for each flower"
19112,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",(As it ne'er knew a sun or shower)
19113,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Hangs there the pensive head.'
19114,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
19115,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Southey says--'The father was a man of melancholy temperament, the mother"
19116,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",handsome and lively; and as Shakspeare used to put up at the house on his
19117,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","journeys between Stratford and London, Davenant is said to have affected"
19118,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","the reputation of being Shakspeare's son. If he really did this, there"
19119,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","was a levity, or rather a want of feeling, in the boast, for which social"
19120,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","pleasantry, and the spirits which are induced by wine, afford but little"
19121,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",excuse.'
19122,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
19123,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",He was entered at Lincoln College; he next became page to the Duchess of
19124,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Richmond; and we find him afterwards in the family of Fulk Greville, Lord"
19125,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Brooke--famous as the friend of Sir Philip Sidney. He began to write for
19126,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",the stage in 1628; and on the death of Ben Jonson he was made Poet Laureate
19127,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","--to the disappointment of Thomas May, so much praised by Johnson and"
19128,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","others for his proficiency in Latin poetry, as displayed in his supplement"
19129,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",to Lucan's 'Pharsalia.' He became afterwards manager of Drury Lane; but
19130,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","owing to his connexion with the intrigues of that unhappy period, he was"
19131,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","imprisoned in the Tower, and subsequently made his escape to France. On his"
19132,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","return to England, he distinguished himself greatly in the Royal cause; and"
19133,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","when that became desperate, he again took refuge in France, and wrote part"
19134,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",of his 'Gondibert.' He projected a scheme for carrying over a colony to
19135,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Virginia; but his vessel was seized by one of the Parliamentary ships--he
19136,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","himself was conveyed a prisoner to Cowes Castle, in the Isle of Wight, and"
19137,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","thence to the Tower, preparatory to being tried by the High Commission. But"
19138,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","a giant hand, worthy of having saved him had he been Shakspeare's veritable"
19139,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","son, was now stretched forth to his rescue--the hand of Milton. In this"
19140,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","generous act Milton was seconded by Whitelocke, and by two aldermen of"
19141,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","York, to whom our poet had rendered some services. Liberated from the"
19142,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Tower, Davenant was also permitted, through the influence of Whitelocke,"
19143,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","to open, in defiance of Puritanic prohibition, a kind of theatre at Rutland"
19144,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","House, and by enacting his own plays there, he managed to support himself"
19145,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","till the Restoration. He then, it is supposed, repaid to Milton his"
19146,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","friendly service, and shielded him from the wrath of the Court. From this"
19147,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",period Davenant continued to write for the stage--having received the
19148,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","patent of the Duke's Theatre, in Lincoln's Inn--till his death. This event"
19149,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","took place on April 7, 1668. His last play, written in conjunction with"
19150,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Dryden, was an alteration and pollution of Shakspeare's 'Tempest,' which"
19151,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",was more worthy of Trincula than of the authors of 'Absalom and Ahithophel'
19152,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","and of 'Gondibert.' Supposing Davenant the son of Shakspeare, his act to"
19153,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","his father's masterpiece reminds us, in the excess of its filial impiety,"
19154,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",of Ham's conduct to Noah.
19155,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
19156,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","'Gondibert' is a large and able, without being a great poem. It has the"
19157,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","incurable and indefensible defect of dulness. 'The line labours, and the"
19158,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","words move slow.' The story is interesting of itself, but is lost in the"
19159,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","labyrinthine details. It has many lines, and some highly and successfully"
19160,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",wrought passages; but as a whole we may say of it as Porson said of
19161,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","certain better productions, 'It will be read when the works of Homer and"
19162,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Virgil are forgotten--but _not till then_.'

19963,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"acquaintance and friend of that poet. It was not, however, till 1683"

19965,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"toral romance, which, he stated, had been written long since by John"
19966,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"Chalkhill, Esq. He says of the author, 'that he was in his time a man"

19968,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"in his behaviour--a gentleman, a scholar, very innocent and prudent,"

19975,JOHN CHALKHILL.,that of the author of 'Thealma' is adventurous and fantastic. Walton

19981,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"resembles that work of Sir Philip Sidney, not only in subject, but in"
19982,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"execution. Its plot is dark and puzzling, its descriptions are rich to"
19983,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"luxuriance, its narrative is tedious, and its characters are mere"
19984,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"shadows. But although a dream, it is a dream of genius, and brings"
19985,JOHN CHALKHILL.,beautifully before our imagination that early period in the world's
19986,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"history, in which poets and painters have taught us to believe, when the"
19987,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"heavens were nearer, the skies clearer, the fat of the earth richer, the"
19988,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"foam of the sea brighter, than in our degenerate days;--when shepherds,"
19989,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"reposing under broad, umbrageous oaks, saw, or thought they saw, in the"
19990,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"groves the shadow of angels, and on the mountain-summits the descending"
19991,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"footsteps of God. Chalkhill resembles, of all our modern poets, perhaps"
19992,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"Shelley most, in the ideality of his conception, the enthusiasm of his"
19993,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"spirit, and the unmitigated gorgeousness of his imagination."

20345,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,Very little is known of the life of this lady-poet. She was born in
20346,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"1631. Her maiden name was Fowler. She married James Phillips, Esq., of"
20347,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"the Priory of Cardigan. Her poems, published under the name of ""Orinda,"""
20348,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"were very popular in her lifetime, although it was said they were"
20349,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,published without her consent. She translated two of the tragedies of
20350,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"Corneille, and left a volume of letters to Sir Charles Cotterell. These,"
20351,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"however, did not appear till after her death. She died of small-pox"
20352,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,--then a deadly disease--in 1664. She seems to have been a favourite
20353,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,alike with the wits and the divines of her age. Jeremy Taylor addressed
20354,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"to her his ""Measures and Offices of Friendship;"" Dryden praised her; and"
20355,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,"Flatman and Cowley, besides imitating her poems while she was living,"
20356,CATHARINE PHILLIPS.,paid rhymed tributes to her memory when dead. Her verses are never

20537,THOMAS STANLEY.,"poetical. He was the only son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Camberlow Green,"
20538,THOMAS STANLEY.,"in Hertfordshire, and was born in 1620. He received his education at"
20539,THOMAS STANLEY.,"Pembroke College, Oxford; and after travelling for some years abroad,"

20543,THOMAS STANLEY.,"'Kisses' of Secundus, as well as from Marino, Boscan, Tristan, and"

20730,ANDREW MARVELL.,
20731,ANDREW MARVELL.,
20732,ANDREW MARVELL.,"This noble-minded patriot and poet, the friend of Milton, the Abdiel of a"
20733,ANDREW MARVELL.,"dark and corrupt age,--'faithful found among the faithless, faithful only"
20734,ANDREW MARVELL.,"he,'--was born in Hull in 1620. He was sent to Cambridge, and is said"
20735,ANDREW MARVELL.,"there to have nearly fallen a victim to the proselytising Jesuits, who"
20736,ANDREW MARVELL.,"enticed him to London. His father, however, a clergyman in Hull, went"
20737,ANDREW MARVELL.,"in search of and brought him back to his university, where speedily, by"
20738,ANDREW MARVELL.,"extensive culture and the vigorous exercise of his powerful faculties,"
20739,ANDREW MARVELL.,"he emancipated himself for ever from the dominion, and the danger of the"
20740,ANDREW MARVELL.,"dominion, of superstition and bigotry. We know little more about the early"
20741,ANDREW MARVELL.,"days of our poet. When only twenty, he lost his father in remarkable"
20742,ANDREW MARVELL.,"circumstances. In 1640, he had embarked on the Humber in company with a"
20743,ANDREW MARVELL.,"youthful pair whom he was to marry at Barrow, in Lincolnshire. The weather"
20744,ANDREW MARVELL.,"was calm; but Marvell, seized with a sudden presentiment of danger, threw"
20745,ANDREW MARVELL.,"his staff ashore, and cried out, 'Ho for heaven!' A storm came on, and the"
20746,ANDREW MARVELL.,"whole company perished. In consequence of this sad event, the gentleman,"
20747,ANDREW MARVELL.,"whose daughter was to have been married, conceiving that the father had"
20748,ANDREW MARVELL.,"sacrificed his life while performing an act of friendship, adopted young"
20749,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Marvell as his son. Owing to this, he received a better education, and"
20750,ANDREW MARVELL.,was sent abroad to travel. It is said that at Rome he met and formed a
20751,ANDREW MARVELL.,"friendship with Milton, then engaged on his immortal continental tour."
20752,ANDREW MARVELL.,"We find Marvell next at Constantinople, as Secretary to the English"
20753,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Embassy at that Court. We then lose sight of him till 1653, when he was"
20754,ANDREW MARVELL.,engaged by the Protector to superintend the education of a Mr Dutton at
20755,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Eton. For a year and a half after Cromwell's death, Marvell assisted"
20756,ANDREW MARVELL.,Milton as Latin Secretary to the Protector. Our readers are all familiar
20757,ANDREW MARVELL.,"with the print of Cromwell and Milton seated together at the council-table,"
20758,ANDREW MARVELL.,"--the one the express image of active power and rugged grandeur, the other"
20759,ANDREW MARVELL.,of thoughtful majesty and ethereal grace. Marvell might have been added as
20760,ANDREW MARVELL.,"a third, and become the emblem of strong English sense and incorruptible"
20761,ANDREW MARVELL.,"integrity. A letter of Milton's was, not long since, discovered, dated"
20762,ANDREW MARVELL.,"February 1652, in which he speaks of Marvell as fitted, by his knowledge"
20763,ANDREW MARVELL.,"of Latin and his experience of teaching, to be his assistant. He was not"
20764,ANDREW MARVELL.,"appointed, however, till 1657. In 1660, he became member for Hull, and was"
20765,ANDREW MARVELL.,"re-elected as long as he lived. He was absent, however, from England for"
20766,ANDREW MARVELL.,"two years, in the beginning of the reign, in Germany and Holland. After-"
20767,ANDREW MARVELL.,wards he sought leave from his constituents to act as Ambassador's
20768,ANDREW MARVELL.,Secretary to Lord Carlisle at the Northern Courts; but from the year 1665
20769,ANDREW MARVELL.,"to his death, his attention to his parliamentary duties was unremitting."
20770,ANDREW MARVELL.,He constantly corresponded with his constituents; and after the longest
20771,ANDREW MARVELL.,"sittings, he used to write out for their use a minute account of public"
20772,ANDREW MARVELL.,"proceedings ere he went to bed, or took any refreshment. He was one of"
20773,ANDREW MARVELL.,the last members who received pay from the town he represented; (2s.
20774,ANDREW MARVELL.,"a-day was probably the sum;) and his constituents were wont, besides, to"
20775,ANDREW MARVELL.,send him barrels of ale as tokens of their regard. Marvell spoke little
20776,ANDREW MARVELL.,in the House; but his heart and vote were always in the right place. Even
20777,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Prince Eupert continually consulted him, and was sometimes persuaded by"
20778,ANDREW MARVELL.,him to support the popular side; and King Charles having met him once in
20779,ANDREW MARVELL.,"private, was so delighted with his wit and agreeable manners, that he"
20780,ANDREW MARVELL.,thought him worth trying to bribe. He sent Lord Danby to offer him a mark
20781,ANDREW MARVELL.,"of his Majesty's consideration. Marvell, who was seated in a dingy room"
20782,ANDREW MARVELL.,"up several flights of stairs, declined the proffer, and, it is said,"
20783,ANDREW MARVELL.,called his servant to witness that he had dined for three successive days
20784,ANDREW MARVELL.,"on the same shoulder of mutton, and was not likely, therefore, to care"
20785,ANDREW MARVELL.,"for or need a bribe. When the Treasurer was gone, he had to send to a"
20786,ANDREW MARVELL.,"friend to borrow a guinea. Although, a silent senator, Marvell was a"
20787,ANDREW MARVELL.,copious and popular writer. He attacked Bishop Parker for his slavish
20788,ANDREW MARVELL.,"principles, in a piece entitled 'The Rehearsal Transposed,' in which he"
20789,ANDREW MARVELL.,takes occasion to vindicate and panegyrise his old colleague Milton. His
20790,ANDREW MARVELL.,anonymous 'Account of the Growth of Arbitrary Power and Popery in England'
20791,ANDREW MARVELL.,"excited a sensation, and a reward was offered for the apprehension of the"
20792,ANDREW MARVELL.,author and printer. Marvell had many of the elements of a first-rate
20793,ANDREW MARVELL.,"political pamphleteer. He had wit of a most pungent kind, great though"
20794,ANDREW MARVELL.,"coarse fertility of fancy, and a spirit of independence that nothing could"
20795,ANDREW MARVELL.,"subdue or damp. He was the undoubted ancestor of the Defoes, Swifts,"
20796,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Steeles, Juniuses, and Burkes, in whom this kind of authorship reached its"
20797,ANDREW MARVELL.,"perfection, ceased to be fugitive, and assumed classical rank."
20798,ANDREW MARVELL.,
20799,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Marvell had been repeatedly threatened with assassination, and hence,"
20800,ANDREW MARVELL.,"when he died suddenly on the 16th of August 1678, it was surmised that"
20801,ANDREW MARVELL.,he had been removed by poison. The Corporation of Hull voted a sum to
20802,ANDREW MARVELL.,"defray his funeral expenses, and for raising a monument to his memory;"
20803,ANDREW MARVELL.,"but owing to the interference of the Court, through the rector of the"
20804,ANDREW MARVELL.,"parish, this votive tablet was not at the time erected. He was buried in"
20805,ANDREW MARVELL.,St Giles-in-the-Fields.
20806,ANDREW MARVELL.,
20807,ANDREW MARVELL.,"'Out of the strong came forth sweetness,' saith the Hebrew record. And"
20808,ANDREW MARVELL.,so from the sturdy Andrew Marvell have proceeded such soft and lovely
20809,ANDREW MARVELL.,"strains as 'The Emigrants,' 'The Nymph complaining for the Death of her"
20810,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Fawn,' 'Young Love,' &c. The statue of Memnon became musical at the dawn;"
20811,ANDREW MARVELL.,"and the stern patriot, whom no bribe could buy and no flattery melt, is"
20812,ANDREW MARVELL.,found sympathising in song with a boatful of banished Englishmen in the
20813,ANDREW MARVELL.,"remote Bermudas, and inditing 'Thoughts in a Garden,' from which you might"
20814,ANDREW MARVELL.,"suppose that he had spent his life more with melons than with men, and was"
20815,ANDREW MARVELL.,better acquainted with the motions of a bee-hive than with the contests of
20816,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Parliament, and the distractions of a most distracted age. It was said"
20817,ANDREW MARVELL.,"(not with thorough truth) of Milton, that he could cut out a Colossus from"
20818,ANDREW MARVELL.,"a rock, but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones--a task which his"
20819,ANDREW MARVELL.,"assistant may be said to have performed in his stead, in his small but"
20820,ANDREW MARVELL.,delectable copies of verse.

21177,IZAAK WALTON.,"This amiable enemy of the finny tribe was born in Stafford, in August"
21178,IZAAK WALTON.,"1593. We hear of him first as settled in London, following the trade"
21179,IZAAK WALTON.,"of a sempster, or linen-draper, having a shop in the Royal Burse, in"
21180,IZAAK WALTON.,"Cornhill, which was 'seven feet and a half long, and five wide,' and"
21181,IZAAK WALTON.,where he became possessed of a moderate fortune. He spent his leisure
21182,IZAAK WALTON.,"time in fishing 'with honest Nat and R. Roe.' From the Royal Burse, he"
21183,IZAAK WALTON.,"removed to Fleet Street, where he had 'one half of a shop,' a hosier"
21184,IZAAK WALTON.,"occupying the other half. In 1632, he married Anne, the daughter of"
21185,IZAAK WALTON.,"Thomas Ken of Furnival's Inn, and sister of Dr Ken, the celebrated"
21186,IZAAK WALTON.,"Bishop of Bath and Wells. Through her and her kindred, he became"
21187,IZAAK WALTON.,"acquainted with many eminent men of the day. His wife, 'a woman of"
21188,IZAAK WALTON.,"remarkable prudence and primitive piety,' died long before him. He"
21189,IZAAK WALTON.,"retired from business in 1643, and lived, for forty years after, a life"
21190,IZAAK WALTON.,"of leisure and quiet enjoyment, spending much of his time in the houses"
21191,IZAAK WALTON.,"of his friends, and much of it by the still waters, which he so dearly"
21192,IZAAK WALTON.,loved. Walton commenced his literary career by writing a Life of Dr
21193,IZAAK WALTON.,"Donne, and followed with another of Sir Henry Wotton, prefixed to his"
21194,IZAAK WALTON.,"literary remains. In 1653 appeared his 'Complete Angler,' four editions"
21195,IZAAK WALTON.,"of which were called for before his decease. He wrote, in 1662, a Life"
21196,IZAAK WALTON.,"of Richard Hooker; in 1670, a Life of George Herbert; and, in 1678, a"
21197,IZAAK WALTON.,Life of Bishop Sanderson--all distinguished by _naïveté_ and heart. In
21198,IZAAK WALTON.,"1680, he published an anonymous discourse on the 'Distempers of the"
21199,IZAAK WALTON.,"Times.' In 1683, he printed, as we have seen, Chalkhill's 'Thealma and"
21200,IZAAK WALTON.,"Clearchus;' and on the 15th of December in the same year, he died at"
21201,IZAAK WALTON.,"Winchester, while residing with his son-in-law, Dr Hawkins, Prebendary"
21202,IZAAK WALTON.,of Winchester Cathedral.

21204,IZAAK WALTON.,Walton is one of the most loveable of all authors. Your admiration of
21205,IZAAK WALTON.,him is always melting into affection. Red as his and is with the blood
21206,IZAAK WALTON.,"of fish, you pant to grasp it and press it to yours. You go with him"
21207,IZAAK WALTON.,"to the fishing as you would with a bright-eyed boy, relishing his"
21208,IZAAK WALTON.,"simple-hearted enthusiasm, and leaning down to listen to his precocious"
21209,IZAAK WALTON.,"remarks, and to pat his curly head. It is the prevalence of the"
21210,IZAAK WALTON.,childlike element which makes Walton's 'Angler' rank with Bunyan's
21211,IZAAK WALTON.,"'Pilgrim,' 'Robinson Crusoe,' and White's 'Natural History of Selborne,'"
21212,IZAAK WALTON.,as among the most delightful books in the language. Its descriptions of
21213,IZAAK WALTON.,"nature, too, are so fresh, that you smell to them as to a green leaf."
21214,IZAAK WALTON.,"Walton would not have been at home fishing in the Forth or Clyde, or in"
21215,IZAAK WALTON.,"such rivers as are found in Norway, the milk-blue Logen, or the grass-"
21216,IZAAK WALTON.,"green Rauma, uniting, with its rich mediation, Romsdale Horn to the"
21217,IZAAK WALTON.,tremendous Witch-Peaks which lower on the opposite side of the valley;
21218,IZAAK WALTON.,"--the waters of his own dear England, going softly and somewhat drowsily"
21219,IZAAK WALTON.,"on their path, are the sources of his inspiration, and seem to sound like"
21220,IZAAK WALTON.,the echoes of his own subdued but gladsome spirit. Johnson defined angling
21221,IZAAK WALTON.,"as a rod with a fish at one end, and a fool at the other; in Walton's"
21222,IZAAK WALTON.,"case, we may correct the expression to 'a rod with a fish at one end, and"
21223,IZAAK WALTON.,"a fine old fellow--the ""ae best fellow in the world""--at the other'--"

21269,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","We hear of the Spirit of Evil on one occasion entering into swine, but,"
21270,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","if possible, a stranger sight is that of the Spirit of Poesy finding a"
21271,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",similar incarnation. Certainly the connexion of genius in the Earl of
21272,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",Rochester with a life of the most degrading and desperate debauchery is
21273,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",one of the chief marvels of this marvellous world.
21274,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21275,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","John Wilmot was the son of Henry, Lord Rochester, and was born April 10,"
21276,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","1647, at Ditchley in Oxfordshire. He was taught grammar at the school of"
21277,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Burford. He then 'entered a nobleman' into Wadham College, when twelve"
21278,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","years old, and at 1661, when only fourteen, he was, in conjunction with"
21279,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","some others of rank, made M.A. by Lord Clarendon in person. Pursuing his"
21280,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","travels in France and Italy, he went in 1665 to sea with the Earl of"
21281,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Sandwich, and distinguished himself at Bergen in an attack on the Dutch"
21282,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","fleet. Next year, while serving under Sir Edward Spragge, his commander"
21283,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",sent him in the heat of an engagement with a reproof to one of his
21284,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",captains--a duty which Wilmot gallantly accomplished amidst a storm of
21285,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",shot. With this early courage some of his biographers have contrasted
21286,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","his subsequent reputation for cowardice, his slinking away out of"
21287,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","street-quarrels, his refusing to fight the Duke of Buckingham, &c. This"
21288,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",diversity at different periods may perhaps be accounted for on the
21289,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","ground of the nervousness which continued dissipation produces, and"
21290,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","perhaps from his poetical temperament. A poet, we are persuaded, is"
21291,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","often the bravest, and often the most pusillanimous of men. Byron was"
21292,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","unquestionably in general a brave, almost a pugnacious man; and yet he"
21293,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","confesses that at certain times, had one proceeded to horsewhip him,"
21294,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","he would not have had the hardihood to resist. Shelley, who, in a"
21295,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","tremendous storm, behaved with dauntless heroism, and who would at any"
21296,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","time have acted on the example of his own character in 'Prometheus,'"
21297,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","who, in a shipwreck,"
21298,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21299,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",'gave an enemy
21300,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","His plank, then plunged aside to die,'"
21301,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21302,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","was yet subject to paroxysms of nervous horror, which made him perspire"
21303,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",and tremble like a spirit-seeing steed. Rochester had the same
21304,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","temperament, and a similar creed, with these men, although inferior to"
21305,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",them both in _morale_ and in genius.
21306,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21307,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",His character was certainly very depraved. He told Burnet on his
21308,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","deathbed that for five years he had not known the sensation of sobriety,"
21309,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","having been all that time either totally drunk, or mad through the dregs"
21310,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","of drunkenness. He on one occasion, while in this state, erected a stage"
21311,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","on Tower Hill, and addressed the mob as a naked mountebank. Even after"
21312,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","he became more temperate, he continued and even increased his"
21313,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","licentiousness--one devil went out, and seven entered in. He pursued low"
21314,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",amours in disguise; he practised occasionally as a quack doctor; and at
21315,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","other times he retired to the country, and, like Byron, amused himself"
21316,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",by libelling all his acquaintances--every line in each libel being a
21317,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","lie. Notwithstanding all this, he was a favourite with Charles II., who"
21318,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","made him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, and comptroller of"
21319,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Woodstock Park. In his lucid intervals he recurred to his studies, wrote"
21320,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","occasional verses, read in French Boileau and in English Cowley, and is"
21321,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",called by Wood the best scholar among all the nobility.
21322,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21323,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","At last, ere he was thirty-one, the 'dreary old sort of feel,' and the"
21324,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","'rigid fibre and stiffening limbs,' of which Byron and Burns, when"
21325,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","scarcely older, complained, began to assail Rochester. He had exhausted"
21326,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","his capacity of enjoyment by excess, and had deprived himself of the"
21327,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",consolations of religion by infidelity. His unbelief was not like
21328,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Shelley's--the growth of his own mind, and the fruit of unbridled,"
21329,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","though earnest, speculation;--it was merely a drug which he snatched"
21330,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","from the laboratories of others to deaden his remorse, and enable him to"
21331,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",look with desperate calmness to the blotted Past and the lowering
21332,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Future. At this stage of his career, he became acquainted with Bishop"
21333,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Burnet, who has recorded his conversion and edifying end in a book"
21334,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","which, says Johnson, 'the critic ought to read for its elegance, the"
21335,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","philosopher for its arguments, and the saint for its piety.' To this,"
21336,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","after Johnson's example, we refer our readers. Eochester died July 26,"
21337,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","1680, before he had completed his thirty-fourth year. He was married,"
21338,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","and left three daughters and a son named Charles, who did not long"
21339,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","survive his father. With him the male line ceased, and the title was"
21340,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",conferred on a younger son of Lord Clarendon. His poems appeared in the
21341,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","year of his death, professing on the title-page to be printed at"
21342,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Antwerp. They contain much that is spurious, but some productions that"
21343,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","are undoubtedly Rochester's. They are at the best, poor fragmentary"
21344,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","exhibitions of a vigorous, but undisciplined mind. His songs are rather"
21345,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",easy than lively. His imitations are distinguished by grace and spirit.
21346,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","His 'Nothing' is a tissue of clever conceits, like gaudy weeds growing"
21347,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","on a sterile soil, but here and there contains a grand and gloomy image,"
21348,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",such as--
21349,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21350,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",'And rebel Light obscured thy reverend dusky face.'
21351,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21352,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","His 'Satire against Man' might be praised for its vigorous misanthropy,"
21353,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",but is chiefly copied from Boileau.
21354,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
21355,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",Rochester may be signalised as the first thoroughly depraved and vicious
21356,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","person, so far as we remember, who assumed the office of the satirist,"
21357,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","--the first, although not, alas! the last human imitator of 'Satan"
21358,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","accusing Sin.' Some satirists before him had been faulty characters,"
21359,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","while rather inconsistently assailing the faults of others; but here,"
21360,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","for the first time, was a man of no virtue, or belief in virtue whatever,"
21361,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","(his tenderness to his family, revealed in his letters, is just that of"
21362,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","the tiger fondling his cubs, and seeming, perhaps, to _them_ a 'much-"
21363,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","misrepresented character,') and whose life was one mass of wounds,"
21364,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","bruises, and putrefying sores,--a naked satyr who gloried in his shame,"
21365,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",--becoming a severe castigator of public morals and of private character.
21366,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Surely there was a gross anomaly implied in this, which far greater"
21367,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",genius than Rochester's could never have redeemed.

21407,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21408,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21409,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Wentworth Dillon, Earl of Roscommon, was the son of James Dillon and"
21410,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Elizabeth Wentworth. She was the sister of the infamous Strafford, who"
21411,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,was at once uncle and godfather to our poet. In what exact year Dillon
21412,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"was born is uncertain, but it was some time about 1633. His father had"
21413,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,been converted from Popery by Usher; and when the Irish Rebellion broke
21414,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"out, Strafford, afraid of the fury of the Irish, sent for his godson,"
21415,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"and took him to his own seat in Yorkshire, where he was taught Latin"
21416,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"with great care. He was sent afterwards to Caen, where he studied under"
21417,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Bochart. It is said that while playing extravagantly there at the
21418,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"customary games of boys, he suddenly paused, became grave, and cried"
21419,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"out, 'My father is dead,' and that a fortnight after arrived tidings"
21420,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,from Ireland confirming his impression. Johnson is inclined to believe
21421,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"this story, and we are more than inclined. Since the lexicographer's"
21422,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"day, many of what used to be called his 'superstitions' have been"
21423,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"established as certain facts, although their explanation is still"
21424,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,shrouded in darkness. Roscommon was then only ten years of age.
21425,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21426,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"From Caen he travelled to Italy, where he obtained a profound knowledge"
21427,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"of medals. At the Restoration he returned to England, where he was made"
21428,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Captain of the Band of Pensioners, and subsequently Master of the Horse"
21429,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"to the Duchess of York. He became unfortunately addicted to gambling,"
21430,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"and, through this miserable habit, he got embroiled in endless quarrels,"
21431,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,as well as in pecuniary embarassments.
21432,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21433,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Business compelled him to visit Ireland, where the Duke of Orrnond made"
21434,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"him Captain of the Guards. On his return to England in 1662, he married"
21435,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"the Lady Frances, daughter of the Earl of Burlington. By her he had no"
21436,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"issue. His second wife, whom he married in 1674, was Isabella, daughter"
21437,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"of Matthew Beynton of Barmister, in Yorkshire."
21438,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21439,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Roscommon now began to meditate and execute literary projects. He
21440,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"produced an 'Essay on Translated Verse,' (in 1681,) a translation of"
21441,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Horace's 'Art of Poetry,' and other pieces. He projected, in conjunction"
21442,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"with his friend Dryden, a plan for refining our language and fixing its"
21443,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"standard, as if Time were not the great refiner, fixer, and enricher of"
21444,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"a tongue. While busy with these schemes and occupations, the troubles of"
21445,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"James II.'s reign commenced. Roscommon determined to retire to Rome,"
21446,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"saying, 'It is best to sit near the chimney when the chamber smokes.'"
21447,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Death, however, prevented him from reaching the beloved and desired"
21448,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"focus of Roman Catholic darkness. He was assailed by gout, and an"
21449,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"ignorant French empiric, whom he consulted, contrived to drive the"
21450,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"disease into the bowels. Roscommon expired, uttering with great fervour"
21451,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"two lines from his own translation of the 'Dies Irae,'--"
21452,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21453,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"'My God, my Father, and my Friend,"
21454,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Do not forsake me in my end.'
21455,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
21456,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,This was in 1684. He received a pompous interment in Westminster Abbey.

21458,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Roscommon does not deserve the name of a great poet. He was a man of
21459,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,varied accomplishments and exquisite taste rather than of genius. His
21460,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"'Essay on Translated Verse' is a sound and sensible, not a profound and"
21461,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,brilliant production. In one point he went before his age. He praises
21462,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' although unfortunately he selects for encomium"
21463,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,the passage in the sixth book describing the angels fighting against
21464,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,each other with fire-arms--a passage which most critics have considered
21465,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,a blot upon the poem.

21693,CHARLES COTTON.,"Hearty, careless 'Charley Cotton' was born in 1630. His father, Sir"
21694,CHARLES COTTON.,"George Cotton, was improvident and intemperate in his latter days, and"
21695,CHARLES COTTON.,"left the poet an encumbered estate situated at Ashbourne, in Derbyshire,"
21696,CHARLES COTTON.,near the river Dove. This place will recall the words quoted by O'Connell
21697,CHARLES COTTON.,in Parliament in reference to the present Lord Derby:--
21698,CHARLES COTTON.,
21699,CHARLES COTTON.,"'Down thy fair banks, romantic Ashbourne, glides"
21700,CHARLES COTTON.,"The Derby dilly, with its six insides.'"
21701,CHARLES COTTON.,
21702,CHARLES COTTON.,"Charles studied at Cambridge; and after travelling abroad, married the"
21703,CHARLES COTTON.,"daughter of Sir Thomas Owthorp in Nottinghamshire, who does not appear"
21704,CHARLES COTTON.,"to have lived long. His extravagance keeping him poor, he was compelled"
21705,CHARLES COTTON.,"to eke out his means by translating works from the French and Italian,"
21706,CHARLES COTTON.,including those of a spirit somewhat kindred to his own--Montaigne. At
21707,CHARLES COTTON.,"the age of forty, he obtained a captain's commission in the army, and"
21708,CHARLES COTTON.,"went to Ireland. There he met with his second wife, Mary, Countess"
21709,CHARLES COTTON.,"Dowager of Ardglass, the widow of Lord Cornwall. She possessed a"
21710,CHARLES COTTON.,"jointure of £1500 a-year, secured, however, after marriage, from her"
21711,CHARLES COTTON.,husband's imprudent and reckless management. He returned to his English
21712,CHARLES COTTON.,"estate, where he became passionately fond of fishing,--intimate with"
21713,CHARLES COTTON.,"Izaak Walton, whom he invited in a poem, although now eighty-three years"
21714,CHARLES COTTON.,"old, to visit him in the country--and where he built a fishing-house,"
21715,CHARLES COTTON.,with the initials of Izaak's name and his own united in ciphers over
21716,CHARLES COTTON.,"the door; the walls, too, being painted with fishing scenes, and the"
21717,CHARLES COTTON.,portraits of Cotton and Walton appearing upon the beaufet. Poor Charles
21718,CHARLES COTTON.,"had a less fortunate career than his friend, dying insolvent at"
21719,CHARLES COTTON.,Westminster in 1687.
21720,CHARLES COTTON.,
21721,CHARLES COTTON.,"Careless gaiety and reckless extravagance, blended with heart, sense,"
21722,CHARLES COTTON.,"and sincerity, were the characteristics of Cotton as a man, and were, as"
21723,CHARLES COTTON.,"is usually the case, transferred to his poetry. He squandered his pence"
21724,CHARLES COTTON.,and his powers with equal profusion. His travestie of the 'Aeneid' is
21725,CHARLES COTTON.,"pronounced by Christopher North (who must have read it, however,) a"
21726,CHARLES COTTON.,"beastly book. Campbell says, with striking justice, of another of"
21727,CHARLES COTTON.,"Cotton's productions, 'His imitations of Lucian betray the grossest"
21728,CHARLES COTTON.,"misconception of humorous effect, when he attempts to burlesque that"
21729,CHARLES COTTON.,which is ludicrous already.' It is like trying to turn the 'Tale of
21730,CHARLES COTTON.,"a Tub' into ridicule. But Cotton's own vein, as exhibited in his"
21731,CHARLES COTTON.,"'Invitation to Walton,' his 'New Year,' and his 'Voyage to Ireland,'"
21732,CHARLES COTTON.,(which anticipates in some measure the style of Anstey in the 'New Bath
21733,CHARLES COTTON.,"Guide,') is very rich and varied, full of ease, picturesque spirit, and"
21734,CHARLES COTTON.,"humour, and stamps him a genuine, if not a great poet."

21831,CANTO I.,
21832,CANTO I.,"'Twas now the most beautiful time of the year,"
21833,CANTO I.,"The days were now long, and the sky was now clear,"
21834,CANTO I.,"And May, that fair lady of splendid renown,"
21835,CANTO I.,"Had dressed herself fine, in her flowered tabby gown,"
21836,CANTO I.,"When about some two hours and an half after noon,"
21837,CANTO I.,"When it grew something late, though I thought it too soon,"
21838,CANTO I.,"With a pitiful voice, and a most heavy heart,"
21839,CANTO I.,I tuned up my pipes to sing _'loth to depart;_'
21840,CANTO I.,"The ditty concluded, I called for my horse,"
21841,CANTO I.,"And with a good pack did the jument endorse,"
21842,CANTO I.,"Till he groaned and he f----d under the burden,"
21843,CANTO I.,For sorrow had made me a cumbersome lurden:
21844,CANTO I.,"And now farewell, Dove, where I've caught such brave dishes"
21845,CANTO I.,"Of over-grown, golden, and silver-scaled fishes;"
21846,CANTO I.,"Thy trout and thy grayling may now feed securely,"
21847,CANTO I.,I've left none behind me can take 'em so surely;
21848,CANTO I.,"Feed on then, and breed on, until the next year,"
21849,CANTO I.,But if I return I expect my arrear.
21850,CANTO I.,
21851,CANTO I.,"By pacing and trotting betimes in the even,"
21852,CANTO I.,"Ere the sun had forsaken one half of the heaven,"
21853,CANTO I.,"We all at fair Congerton took up our inn,"
21854,CANTO I.,Where the sign of a king kept a King and his queen:
21855,CANTO I.,But who do you think came to welcome me there'?
21856,CANTO I.,"No worse a man, marry, than good master mayor,"
21857,CANTO I.,"With his staff of command, yet the man was not lame,"
21858,CANTO I.,"But he needed it more when he went, than he came;"
21859,CANTO I.,"After three or four hours of friendly potation,"
21860,CANTO I.,"We took leave each of other in courteous fashion,"
21861,CANTO I.,"When each one, to keep his brains fast in his head,"
21862,CANTO I.,"Put on a good nightcap, and straightway to bed."
21863,CANTO I.,
21864,CANTO I.,"Next morn, having paid for boiled, roasted, and bacon,"
21865,CANTO I.,"And of sovereign hostess our leaves kindly taken,"
21866,CANTO I.,"(For her king, as 'twas rumoured, by late pouring down,"
21867,CANTO I.,"This morning had got a foul flaw in his crown,)"
21868,CANTO I.,"We mounted again, and full soberly riding,"
21869,CANTO I.,Three miles we had rid ere we met with a biding;
21870,CANTO I.,"But there, having over-night plied the tap well,"
21871,CANTO I.,We now must needs water at a place called Holmes Chapel:
21872,CANTO I.,"'A hay!' quoth the foremost, 'ho! who keeps the house?'"
21873,CANTO I.,"Which said, out an host comes as brisk as a louse;"
21874,CANTO I.,"His hair combed as sleek as a barber he'd been,"
21875,CANTO I.,A cravat with black ribbon tied under his chin;
21876,CANTO I.,"Though by what I saw in him, I straight 'gan to fear"
21877,CANTO I.,That knot would be one day slipped under his ear.
21878,CANTO I.,"Quoth he (with low conge), 'What lack you, my lord?'"
21879,CANTO I.,"'The best liquor,' quoth I, 'that the house will afford.'"
21880,CANTO I.,"'You shall straight,' quoth he; and then calls out, 'Mary?"
21881,CANTO I.,"Come quickly, and bring us a quart of Canary.'"
21882,CANTO I.,"'Hold, hold, my spruce host! for i' th' morning so early,"
21883,CANTO I.,I never drink liquor but what's made of barley.'
21884,CANTO I.,"Which words were scarce out, but, which made me admire,"
21885,CANTO I.,My lordship was presently turned into 'squire:
21886,CANTO I.,
21887,CANTO I.,"'Ale, 'squire, you mean?' quoth he nimbly again,"
21888,CANTO I.,"'What, must it be purled'--'No, I love it best plain.'"
21889,CANTO I.,"'Why, if you'll drink ale, sir, pray take my advice,"
21890,CANTO I.,"Here's the best ale i' th' land, if you'll go to the price;"
21891,CANTO I.,"Better, I sure am, ne'er blew out a stopple;"
21892,CANTO I.,"But then, in plain truth, it is sixpence a bottle.'"
21893,CANTO I.,"'Why, faith,' quoth I, 'friend, if your liquor be such,"
21894,CANTO I.,"For the best ale in England, it is not too much:"
21895,CANTO I.,"Let's have it, and quickly.'--'o sir! you may stay;"
21896,CANTO I.,A pot in your pate is a mile in your way:
21897,CANTO I.,"Come, bring out a bottle here presently, wife,"
21898,CANTO I.,Of the best Cheshire hum he e'er drank in his life.'
21899,CANTO I.,"Straight out comes the mistress in waistcoat of silk,"
21900,CANTO I.,"As clear as a milkmaid, as white as her milk,"
21901,CANTO I.,"With visage as oval and sleek as an egg,"
21902,CANTO I.,"As straight as an arrow, as right as my leg:"
21903,CANTO I.,"A curtsey she made, as demure as a sister,"
21904,CANTO I.,"I could not forbear, but alighted and kissed her:"
21905,CANTO I.,"Then ducking another, with most modest mien,"
21906,CANTO I.,"The first word she said was, 'Will 't please you walk in?"
21907,CANTO I.,"I thanked her; but told her, I then could not stay,"
21908,CANTO I.,For the haste of my business did call me away.
21909,CANTO I.,"She said, she was sorry it fell out so odd,"
21910,CANTO I.,"But if, when again I should travel that road,"
21911,CANTO I.,"I would stay there a night, she assured me the nation"
21912,CANTO I.,Should nowhere afford better accommodation:
21913,CANTO I.,"Meanwhile my spruce landlord has broken the cork,"
21914,CANTO I.,"And called for a bodkin, though he had a fork;"
21915,CANTO I.,"But I showed him a screw, which I told my brisk gull"
21916,CANTO I.,A trepan was for bottles had broken their skull;
21917,CANTO I.,"Which, as it was true, he believed without doubt,"
21918,CANTO I.,"But 'twas I that applied it, and pulled the cork out."
21919,CANTO I.,"Bounce, quoth the bottle, the work being done,"
21920,CANTO I.,"It roared, and it smoked, like a new-fired gun;"
21921,CANTO I.,"But the shot missed us all, or else we'd been routed,"
21922,CANTO I.,"Which yet was a wonder, we were so about it."
21923,CANTO I.,"Mine host poured and filled, till he could fill no fuller:"
21924,CANTO I.,"'Look here, sir,' quoth he, 'both for nap and for colour,"
21925,CANTO I.,"Sans bragging, I hate it, nor will I e'er do 't;"
21926,CANTO I.,"I defy Leek, and Lambhith, and Sandwich, to boot.'"
21927,CANTO I.,"By my troth, he said true, for I speak it with tears,"
21928,CANTO I.,"Though I have been a toss-pot these twenty good years,"
21929,CANTO I.,"And have drank so much liquor has made me a debtor,"
21930,CANTO I.,"In my days, that I know of, I never drank better:"
21931,CANTO I.,"We found it so good and we drank so profoundly,"
21932,CANTO I.,That four good round shillings were whipt away roundly;
21933,CANTO I.,"And then I conceived it was time to be jogging,"
21934,CANTO I.,"For our work had been done, had we stay'd t' other noggin."
21935,CANTO I.,
21936,CANTO I.,"From thence we set forth with more metal and spright,"
21937,CANTO I.,"Our horses were empty, our coxcombs were light;"
21938,CANTO I.,"O'er Dellamore forest we, tantivy, posted,"
21939,CANTO I.,Till our horses were basted as if they were roasted:
21940,CANTO I.,"In truth, we pursued might have been by our haste,"
21941,CANTO I.,"And I think Sir George Booth did not gallop so fast,"
21942,CANTO I.,"Till about two o'clock after noon, God be blest,"
21943,CANTO I.,"We came, safe and sound, all to Chester i' th' west."
21944,CANTO I.,
21945,CANTO I.,"And now in high time 'twas to call for some meat,"
21946,CANTO I.,"Though drinking does well, yet some time we must eat:"
21947,CANTO I.,"And i' faith we had victuals both plenty and good,"
21948,CANTO I.,Where we all laid about us as if we were wood:
21949,CANTO I.,"Go thy ways, Mistress Anderton, for a good woman,"
21950,CANTO I.,Thy guests shall by thee ne'er be turned to a common;
21951,CANTO I.,"And whoever of thy entertainment complains,"
21952,CANTO I.,"Let him lie with a drab, and be poxed for his pains."
21953,CANTO I.,
21954,CANTO I.,"And here I must stop the career of my Muse,"
21955,CANTO I.,"The poor jade is weary, 'las! how should she choose?"
21956,CANTO I.,"And if I should further here spur on my course,"
21957,CANTO I.,"I should, questionless, tire both my wits and my horse:"
21958,CANTO I.,"To-night let us rest, for 'tis good Sunday's even,"
21959,CANTO I.,"To-morrow to church, and ask pardon of Heaven."
21960,CANTO I.,"Thus far we our time spent, as here I have penned it,"
21961,CANTO I.,"An odd kind of life, and 'tis well if we mend it:"
21962,CANTO I.,"But to-morrow (God willing) we'll have t' other bout,"
21963,CANTO I.,"And better or worse be 't, for murder will out,"
21964,CANTO I.,"Our future adventures we'll lay down before ye,"
21965,CANTO I.,For my Muse is deep sworn to use truth of the story.
21966,CANTO I.,
21967,CANTO I.,
21968,CANTO II,CANTO II
21969,CANTO II,
21970,CANTO II,"After seven hours' sleep, to commute for pains taken,"
21971,CANTO II,"A man of himself, one would think, might awaken;"
21972,CANTO II,"But riding, and drinking hard, were two such spells,"
21973,CANTO II,"I doubt I'd slept on, but for jangling of bells,"
21974,CANTO II,"Which, ringing to matins all over the town,"
21975,CANTO II,"Made me leap out of bed, and put on my gown."
21976,CANTO II,"With intent (so God mend me) t' have gone to the choir,"
21977,CANTO II,When straight I perceived myself all on a fire;
21978,CANTO II,"For the two forenamed things had so heated my blood,"
21979,CANTO II,That a little phlebotomy would do me good:
21980,CANTO II,"I sent for chirurgeon, who came in a trice,"
21981,CANTO II,"And swift to shed blood, needed not be called twice,"
21982,CANTO II,"But tilted stiletto quite thorough the vein,"
21983,CANTO II,From whence issued out the ill humours amain;
21984,CANTO II,"When having twelve ounces, he bound up my arm,"
21985,CANTO II,"And I gave him two Georges, which did him no harm:"
21986,CANTO II,"But after my bleeding, I soon understood"
21987,CANTO II,It had cooled my devotion as well as my blood;
21988,CANTO II,"For I had no more mind to look on my psalter,"
21989,CANTO II,Than (saving your presence) I had to a halter;
21990,CANTO II,"But, like a most wicked and obstinate sinner,"
21991,CANTO II,Then sat in my chamber till folks came to dinner:
21992,CANTO II,"I dined with good stomach, and very good cheer,"
21993,CANTO II,"With a very fine woman, and good ale and beer;"
21994,CANTO II,"When myself having stuffed than a bagpipe more full,"
21995,CANTO II,I fell to my smoking until I grew dull;
21996,CANTO II,"And, therefore, to take a fine nap thought it best,"
21997,CANTO II,"For when belly full is, bones would be at rest:"
21998,CANTO II,"I tumbled me down on my bed like a swad,"
21999,CANTO II,"Where, oh! the delicious dream that I had!"
22000,CANTO II,"Till the bells, that had been my morning molesters,"
22001,CANTO II,"Now waked me again, chiming all in to vespers:"
22002,CANTO II,"With that starting up, for my man I did whistle,"
22003,CANTO II,And combed out and powdered my locks that were grizzle;
22004,CANTO II,"Had my clothes neatly brushed, and then put on my sword,"
22005,CANTO II,Resolved now to go and attend on the word.
22006,CANTO II,
22007,CANTO II,"Thus tricked, and thus trim, to set forth I begin,"
22008,CANTO II,"Neat and cleanly without, but scarce cleanly within;"
22009,CANTO II,"For why, Heaven knows it, I long time had been"
22010,CANTO II,A most humble obedient servant to sin;
22011,CANTO II,"And now in devotion was even so proud,"
22012,CANTO II,I scorned forsooth to join prayer with the crowd;
22013,CANTO II,"For though courted by all the bells as I went,"
22014,CANTO II,"I was deaf, and regarded not the compliment,"
22015,CANTO II,"But to the cathedral still held on my pace,"
22016,CANTO II,"As't were, scorning to kneel but in the best place."
22017,CANTO II,"I there made myself sure of good music at least,"
22018,CANTO II,"But was something deceived, for 'twas none of the best:"
22019,CANTO II,But however I stay'd at the church's commanding
22020,CANTO II,"Till we came to the 'Peace passes all understanding,'"
22021,CANTO II,"Which no sooner was ended, but whir and away,"
22022,CANTO II,Like boys in a school when they've leave got to play;
22023,CANTO II,"All save master mayor, who still gravely stays"
22024,CANTO II,Till the rest had made room for his worship and's mace:
22025,CANTO II,"Then he and his brethren in order appear,"
22026,CANTO II,"I out of my stall, and fell into his rear;"
22027,CANTO II,"For why, 'tis much safer appearing, no doubt,"
22028,CANTO II,"In authority's tail, than the head of a rout."
22029,CANTO II,
22030,CANTO II,In this rev'rend order we marched from prayer;
22031,CANTO II,The mace before me borne as well as the mayor;
22032,CANTO II,"Who looking behind him, and seeing most plain"
22033,CANTO II,"A glorious gold belt in the rear of his train,"
22034,CANTO II,"Made such a low congé, forgetting his place,"
22035,CANTO II,I was never so honoured before in my days:
22036,CANTO II,"But then off went my scalp-case, and down went my fist,"
22037,CANTO II,"Till the pavement, too hard, by my knuckles was kissed;"
22038,CANTO II,"By which, though thick-skulled, he must understand this,"
22039,CANTO II,That I was a most humble servant of his;
22040,CANTO II,"Which also so wonderful kindly he took,"
22041,CANTO II,"(As I well perceived both b' his gesture and look,)"
22042,CANTO II,"That to have me dogg'd home he straightway appointed,"
22043,CANTO II,"Resolving, it seems, to be better acquainted."
22044,CANTO II,"I was scarce in my quarters, and set down on crupper,"
22045,CANTO II,"But his man was there too, to invite me to supper:"
22046,CANTO II,"I start up, and after most respective fashion"
22047,CANTO II,Gave his worship much thanks for his kind invitation;
22048,CANTO II,"But begged his excuse, for my stomach was small,"
22049,CANTO II,And I never did eat any supper at all;
22050,CANTO II,"But that after supper I would kiss his hands,"
22051,CANTO II,And would come to receive his worship's commands.
22052,CANTO II,"Sure no one will say, but a patron of slander,"
22053,CANTO II,That this was not pretty well for a Moorlander:
22054,CANTO II,"And since on such reasons to sup I refused,"
22055,CANTO II,I nothing did doubt to be holden excused;
22056,CANTO II,But my quaint repartee had his worship possess'd
22057,CANTO II,"With so wonderful good a conceit of the rest,"
22058,CANTO II,That with mere impatience he hoped in his breeches
22059,CANTO II,To see the fine fellow that made such fine speeches:
22060,CANTO II,"'Go, sirrah!' quoth he, 'get you to him again,"
22061,CANTO II,"And will and require, in his Majesty's name,"
22062,CANTO II,"That he come; and tell him, obey he were best, or"
22063,CANTO II,I'll teach him to know that he's now in West-Chester.'
22064,CANTO II,"The man, upon this, comes me running again,"
22065,CANTO II,"But yet minced his message, and was not so plain;"
22066,CANTO II,"Saying to me only, 'Good sir, I am sorry"
22067,CANTO II,To tell you my master has sent again for you;
22068,CANTO II,"And has such a longing to have you his guest,"
22069,CANTO II,"That I, with these ears, heard him swear and protest,"
22070,CANTO II,"He would neither say grace, nor sit down on his bum,"
22071,CANTO II,"Nor open his napkin, until you do come.'"
22072,CANTO II,"With that I perceived no excuse would avail,"
22073,CANTO II,"And, seeing there was no defence for a flail,"
22074,CANTO II,"I said I was ready master may'r to obey,"
22075,CANTO II,And therefore desired him to lead me the way.
22076,CANTO II,"We went, and ere Malkin could well lick her ear,"
22077,CANTO II,"(For it but the next door was, forsooth) we were there;"
22078,CANTO II,"Where lights being brought me, I mounted the stairs,"
22079,CANTO II,The worst I e'er saw in my life at a mayor's:
22080,CANTO II,But everything else must be highly commended.
22081,CANTO II,"I there found his worship most nobly attended,"
22082,CANTO II,"Besides such a supper as well did convince,"
22083,CANTO II,A may'r in his province to be a great prince;
22084,CANTO II,"As he sat in his chair, he did not much vary,"
22085,CANTO II,"In state nor in face, from our eighth English Harry;"
22086,CANTO II,"But whether his face was swelled up with fat,"
22087,CANTO II,"Or puffed up with glory, I cannot tell that."
22088,CANTO II,"Being entered the chamber half length of a pike,"
22089,CANTO II,And cutting of faces exceedingly like
22090,CANTO II,"One of those little gentlemen brought from the Indies,"
22091,CANTO II,"And screwing myself into congés and cringes,"
22092,CANTO II,"By then I was half-way advanced in the room,"
22093,CANTO II,"His worship most rev'rendly rose from his bum,"
22094,CANTO II,"And with the more honour to grace and to greet me,"
22095,CANTO II,Advanced a whole step and a half for to meet me;
22096,CANTO II,"Where leisurely doffing a hat worth a tester,"
22097,CANTO II,He bade me most heartily welcome to Chester.
22098,CANTO II,"I thanked him in language the best I was able,"
22099,CANTO II,And so we forthwith sat us all down to table.
22100,CANTO II,
22101,CANTO II,"Now here you must note, and 'tis worth observation,"
22102,CANTO II,That as his chair at one end o' th' table had station;
22103,CANTO II,"So sweet mistress may'ress, in just such another,"
22104,CANTO II,"Like the fair queen of hearts, sat in state at the other;"
22105,CANTO II,"By which I perceived, though it seemed a riddle,"
22106,CANTO II,The lower end of this must be just in the middle:
22107,CANTO II,"But perhaps 'tis a rule there, and one that would mind it"
22108,CANTO II,Amongst the town-statutes 'tis likely might find it.
22109,CANTO II,"But now into the pottage each deep his spoon claps,"
22110,CANTO II,"As in truth one might safely for burning one's chaps,"
22111,CANTO II,"When straight, with the look and the tone of a scold,"
22112,CANTO II,Mistress may'ress complained that the pottage was cold;
22113,CANTO II,"'And all 'long of your fiddle-faddle,' quoth she."
22114,CANTO II,"'Why, what then, Goody Two-Shoes, what if it be?"
22115,CANTO II,"Hold you, if you can, your tittle-tattle,' quoth he."
22116,CANTO II,"I was glad she was snapped thus, and guessed by th' discourse,"
22117,CANTO II,"The may'r, not the gray mare, was the better horse,"
22118,CANTO II,"And yet for all that, there is reason to fear,"
22119,CANTO II,She submitted but out of respect to his year:
22120,CANTO II,"However 'twas well she had now so much grace,"
22121,CANTO II,"Though not to the man, to submit to his place;"
22122,CANTO II,"For had she proceeded, I verily thought"
22123,CANTO II,"My turn would the next be, for I was in fault:"
22124,CANTO II,"But this brush being past, we fell to our diet,"
22125,CANTO II,And every one there filled his belly in quiet.
22126,CANTO II,"Supper being ended, and things away taken,"
22127,CANTO II,Master mayor's curiosity 'gan to awaken;
22128,CANTO II,"Wherefore making me draw something nearer his chair,"
22129,CANTO II,He willed and required me there to declare
22130,CANTO II,"My country, my birth, my estate, and my parts,"
22131,CANTO II,And whether I was not a master of arts;
22132,CANTO II,"And eke what the business was had brought me thither,"
22133,CANTO II,"With what I was going about now, and whither:"
22134,CANTO II,"Giving me caution, no lie should escape me,"
22135,CANTO II,"For if I should trip, he should certainly trap me."
22136,CANTO II,"I answered, my country was famed Staffordshire;"
22137,CANTO II,"That in deeds, bills, and bonds, I was ever writ squire;"
22138,CANTO II,"That of land I had both sorts, some good, and some evil,"
22139,CANTO II,But that a great part on't was pawned to the devil;
22140,CANTO II,"That as for my parts, they were such as he saw;"
22141,CANTO II,"That, indeed, I had a small smatt'ring of law,"
22142,CANTO II,"Which I lately had got more by practice than reading,"
22143,CANTO II,"By sitting o' th' bench, whilst others were pleading;"
22144,CANTO II,"But that arms I had ever more studied than arts,"
22145,CANTO II,And was now to a captain raised by my deserts;
22146,CANTO II,That the business which led me through Palatine ground
22147,CANTO II,"Into Ireland was, whither now I was bound;"
22148,CANTO II,"Where his worship's great favour I loud will proclaim,"
22149,CANTO II,And in all other places wherever I came.
22150,CANTO II,"He said, as to that, I might do what I list,"
22151,CANTO II,"But that I was welcome, and gave me his fist;"
22152,CANTO II,"When having my fingers made crack with his gripes,"
22153,CANTO II,He called to his man for some bottles and pipes.
22154,CANTO II,
22155,CANTO II,To trouble you here with a longer narration
22156,CANTO II,"Of the several parts of our confabulation,"
22157,CANTO II,Perhaps would be tedious; I'll therefore remit ye
22158,CANTO II,"Even to the most rev'rend records of the city,"
22159,CANTO II,"Where, doubtless, the acts of the may'rs are recorded,"
22160,CANTO II,"And if not more truly, yet much better worded."
22161,CANTO II,
22162,CANTO II,"In short, then, we piped and we tippled Canary,"
22163,CANTO II,Till my watch pointed one in the circle horary;
22164,CANTO II,"When thinking it now was high time to depart,"
22165,CANTO II,His worship I thanked with a most grateful heart;
22166,CANTO II,"And because to great men presents are acceptable,"
22167,CANTO II,"I presented the may'r, ere I rose from the table,"
22168,CANTO II,With a certain fantastical box and a stopper;
22169,CANTO II,"And he having kindly accepted my offer,"
22170,CANTO II,"I took my fair leave, such my visage adorning,"
22171,CANTO II,"And to bed, for I was to rise early i' th' morning."

22173,CANTO II,
22174,CANTO III.,CANTO III.
22175,CANTO III.,
22176,CANTO III.,"The sun in the morning disclosed his light,"
22177,CANTO III.,With complexion as ruddy as mine over night;
22178,CANTO III.,"And o'er th' eastern mountains peeping up's head,"
22179,CANTO III.,"The casement being open, espied me in bed;"
22180,CANTO III.,"With his rays he so tickled my lids that I waked,"
22181,CANTO III.,"And was half ashamed, for I found myself naked;"
22182,CANTO III.,"But up I soon start, and was dressed in a trice,"
22183,CANTO III.,"And called for a draught of ale, sugar, and spice;"
22184,CANTO III.,"Which having turned off, I then call to pay,"
22185,CANTO III.,"And packing my nawls, whipt to horse, and away."
22186,CANTO III.,"A guide I had got, who demanded great vails,"
22187,CANTO III.,For conducting me over the mountains of Wales:
22188,CANTO III.,"Twenty good shillings, which sure very large is;"
22189,CANTO III.,"Yet that would not serve, but I must bear his charges;"
22190,CANTO III.,"And yet for all that, rode astride on a beast,"
22191,CANTO III.,"The worst that e'er went on three legs, I protest:"
22192,CANTO III.,"It certainly was the most ugly of jades,"
22193,CANTO III.,His hips and his rump made a right ace of spades;
22194,CANTO III.,"His sides were two ladders, well spur-galled withal;"
22195,CANTO III.,"His neck was a helve, and his head was a mall;"
22196,CANTO III.,"For his colour, my pains and your trouble I'll spare,"
22197,CANTO III.,For the creature was wholly denuded of hair;
22198,CANTO III.,"And, except for two things, as bare as my nail,"
22199,CANTO III.,"A tuft of a mane, and a sprig of a tail;"
22200,CANTO III.,"And by these the true colour one can no more know,"
22201,CANTO III.,"Than by mouse-skins above stairs, the merkin below."
22202,CANTO III.,"Now such as the beast was, even such was the rider,"
22203,CANTO III.,"With a head like a nutmeg, and legs like a spider;"
22204,CANTO III.,"A voice like a cricket, a look like a rat,"
22205,CANTO III.,"The brains of a goose, and the heart of a cat:"
22206,CANTO III.,"Even such was my guide and his beast; let them pass,"
22207,CANTO III.,"The one for a horse, and the other an ass."
22208,CANTO III.,"But now with our horses, what sound and what rotten,"
22209,CANTO III.,"Down to the shore, you must know, we were gotten;"
22210,CANTO III.,"And there we were told, it concerned us to ride,"
22211,CANTO III.,Unless we did mean to encounter the tide;
22212,CANTO III.,"And then my guide lab'ring with heels and with hands,"
22213,CANTO III.,"With two up and one down, hopped over the sands,"
22214,CANTO III.,"Till his horse, finding the labour for three legs too sore,"
22215,CANTO III.,"Foaled out a new leg, and then he had four:"
22216,CANTO III.,"And now by plain dint of hard spurring and whipping,"
22217,CANTO III.,Dry-shod we came where folks sometimes take shipping;
22218,CANTO III.,"And where the salt sea, as the devil were in 't,"
22219,CANTO III.,Came roaring t' have hindered our journey to Flint;
22220,CANTO III.,"But we, by good luck, before him got thither,"
22221,CANTO III.,"He else would have carried us, no man knows whither."
22222,CANTO III.,
22223,CANTO III.,"And now her in Wales is, Saint Taph be her speed,"
22224,CANTO III.,"Gott splutter her taste, some Welsh ale her had need;"
22225,CANTO III.,"For her ride in great haste, and    *     *"
22226,CANTO III.,For fear of her being catched up by the fishes:
22227,CANTO III.,"But the lord of Flint castle's no lord worth a louse,"
22228,CANTO III.,For he keeps ne'er a drop of good drink in his house;
22229,CANTO III.,But in a small house near unto 't there was store
22230,CANTO III.,"Of such ale as, thank God, I ne'er tasted before;"
22231,CANTO III.,"And surely the Welsh are not wise of their fuddle,"
22232,CANTO III.,For this had the taste and complexion of puddle.
22233,CANTO III.,"From thence then we marched, full as dry as we came,"
22234,CANTO III.,"My guide before prancing, his steed no more lame,"
22235,CANTO III.,"O'er hills and o'er valleys uncouth and uneven,"
22236,CANTO III.,"Until 'twixt the hours of twelve and eleven,"
22237,CANTO III.,"More hungry and thirsty than tongue can well tell,"
22238,CANTO III.,We happily came to Saint Winifred's well:
22239,CANTO III.,"I thought it the pool of Bethesda had been,"
22240,CANTO III.,By the cripples lay there; but I went to my inn
22241,CANTO III.,"To speak for some meat, for so stomach did motion,"
22242,CANTO III.,Before I did further proceed in devotion:
22243,CANTO III.,"I went into th' kitchen, where victuals I saw,"
22244,CANTO III.,"Both beef, veal, and mutton, but all on 't was raw;"
22245,CANTO III.,"And some on't alive, but soon went to slaughter,"
22246,CANTO III.,For four chickens were slain by my dame and her daughter;
22247,CANTO III.,"Of which to Saint Win. ere my vows I had paid,"
22248,CANTO III.,They said I should find a rare fricasée made:
22249,CANTO III.,"I thanked them, and straight to the well did repair,"
22250,CANTO III.,"Where some I found cursing, and others at prayer;"
22251,CANTO III.,"Some dressing, some stripping, some out and some in,"
22252,CANTO III.,"Some naked, where botches and boils might be seen;"
22253,CANTO III.,"Of which some were fevers of Venus I'm sure,"
22254,CANTO III.,And therefore unfit for the virgin to cure:
22255,CANTO III.,"But the fountain, in truth, is well worth the sight,"
22256,CANTO III.,The beautiful virgin's own tears not more bright;
22257,CANTO III.,"Nay, none but she ever shed such a tear,"
22258,CANTO III.,"Her conscience, her name, nor herself, were more clear."
22259,CANTO III.,"In the bottom there lie certain stones that look white,"
22260,CANTO III.,"But streaked with pure red, as the morning with light,"
22261,CANTO III.,"Which they say is her blood, and so it may be,"
22262,CANTO III.,"But for that, let who shed it look to it for me."
22263,CANTO III.,"Over the fountain a chapel there stands,"
22264,CANTO III.,Which I wonder has 'scaped master Oliver's hands;
22265,CANTO III.,"The floor's not ill paved, and the margin o' th' spring"
22266,CANTO III.,Is inclosed with a certain octagonal ring;
22267,CANTO III.,"From each angle of which a pillar does rise,"
22268,CANTO III.,Of strength and of thickness enough to suffice
22269,CANTO III.,To support and uphold from falling to ground
22270,CANTO III.,A cupola wherewith the virgin is crowned.
22271,CANTO III.,"Now 'twixt the two angles that fork to the north,"
22272,CANTO III.,"And where the cold nymph does her basin pour forth,"
22273,CANTO III.,"Under ground is a place where they bathe, as 'tis said,"
22274,CANTO III.,"And 'tis true, for I heard folks' teeth hack in their head;"
22275,CANTO III.,"For you are to know, that the rogues and the * *"
22276,CANTO III.,Are not let to pollute the spring-head with their sores.
22277,CANTO III.,"But one thing I chiefly admired in the place,"
22278,CANTO III.,"That a saint and a virgin endued with such grace,"
22279,CANTO III.,Should yet be so wonderful kind a well-willer
22280,CANTO III.,"To that whoring and filching trade of a miller,"
22281,CANTO III.,As within a few paces to furnish the wheels
22282,CANTO III.,Of I cannot tell how many water-mills:
22283,CANTO III.,"I've studied that point much, you cannot guess why,"
22284,CANTO III.,"But the virgin was, doubtless, more righteous than I."
22285,CANTO III.,"And now for my welcome, four, five, or six lasses,"
22286,CANTO III.,"With as many crystalline liberal glasses,"
22287,CANTO III.,Did all importune me to drink of the water
22288,CANTO III.,"Of Saint Winifreda, good Thewith's fair daughter."
22289,CANTO III.,"A while I was doubtful, and stood in a muse,"
22290,CANTO III.,"Not knowing, amidst all that choice, where to choose."
22291,CANTO III.,"Till a pair of black eyes, darting full in my sight,"
22292,CANTO III.,From the rest o' th' fair maidens did carry me quite;
22293,CANTO III.,"I took the glass from her, and whip, off it went,"
22294,CANTO III.,I half doubt I fancied a health to the saint:
22295,CANTO III.,"But he was a great villain committed the slaughter,"
22296,CANTO III.,For Saint Winifred made most delicate water.
22297,CANTO III.,"I slipped a hard shilling into her soft hand,"
22298,CANTO III.,Which had like to have made me the place have profaned;
22299,CANTO III.,"And giving two more to the poor that were there,"
22300,CANTO III.,"Did, sharp as a hawk, to my quarters repair."
22301,CANTO III.,
22302,CANTO III.,"My dinner was ready, and to it I fell,"
22303,CANTO III.,"I never ate better meat, that I can tell;"
22304,CANTO III.,"When having half dined, there comes in my host,"
22305,CANTO III.,"A catholic good, and a rare drunken toast;"
22306,CANTO III.,"This man, by his drinking, inflamed the scot,"
22307,CANTO III.,"And told me strange stories, which I have forgot;"
22308,CANTO III.,"But this I remember, 'twas much on's own life,"
22309,CANTO III.,"And one thing, that he had converted his wife."
22310,CANTO III.,
22311,CANTO III.,"But now my guide told me, it time was to go,"
22312,CANTO III.,For that to our beds we must both ride and row;
22313,CANTO III.,"Wherefore calling to pay, and having accounted,"
22314,CANTO III.,"I soon was down-stairs, and as suddenly mounted:"
22315,CANTO III.,"On then we travelled, our guide still before,"
22316,CANTO III.,"Sometimes on three legs, and sometimes on four,"
22317,CANTO III.,"Coasting the sea, and over hills crawling,"
22318,CANTO III.,"Sometimes on all four, for fear we should fall in;"
22319,CANTO III.,"For underneath Neptune lay skulking to watch us,"
22320,CANTO III.,"And, had we but slipped once, was ready to catch us."
22321,CANTO III.,"Thus in places of danger taking more heed,"
22322,CANTO III.,And in safer travelling mending our speed:
22323,CANTO III.,"Redland Castle and Abergoney we past,"
22324,CANTO III.,And o'er against Connoway came at the last:
22325,CANTO III.,"Just over against a castle there stood,"
22326,CANTO III.,"O' th' right hand the town, and o' th' left hand a wood;"
22327,CANTO III.,'Twixt the wood and the castle they see at high water
22328,CANTO III.,"The storm, the place makes it a dangerous matter;"
22329,CANTO III.,"And besides, upon such a steep rock it is founded,"
22330,CANTO III.,"As would break a man's neck, should he'scape being drowned:"
22331,CANTO III.,"Perhaps though in time one may make them to yield,"
22332,CANTO III.,But 'tis prettiest Cob-castle e'er I beheld.
22333,CANTO III.,
22334,CANTO III.,"The sun now was going t' unharness his steeds,"
22335,CANTO III.,"When the ferry-boat brasking her sides 'gainst the weeds,"
22336,CANTO III.,"Came in as good time as good time could be,"
22337,CANTO III.,To give us a cast o'er an arm of the sea;
22338,CANTO III.,"And bestowing our horses before and abaft,"
22339,CANTO III.,O'er god Neptune's wide cod-piece gave us a waft;
22340,CANTO III.,"Where scurvily landing at foot of the fort,"
22341,CANTO III.,"Within very few paces we entered the port,"
22342,CANTO III.,"Where another King's Head invited me down,"
22343,CANTO III.,For indeed I have ever been true to the crown.

22348,DR HENRY MORE.,DR HENRY MORE.
22349,DR HENRY MORE.,
22350,DR HENRY MORE.,
22351,DR HENRY MORE.,This eminent man was the son of a gentleman of good family and estate
22352,DR HENRY MORE.,"in Grantham, Lincolnshire. He was born in 1614. His father sent him to"
22353,DR HENRY MORE.,"study at Eton, and thence, in 1631, he repaired to Cambridge, where he"
22354,DR HENRY MORE.,was destined to spend the most of his life. Philosophy attracted him
22355,DR HENRY MORE.,"early, in preference to science or literature, and he became a follower"
22356,DR HENRY MORE.,"of Plato, so decided and enthusiastic as to gain for himself the title"
22357,DR HENRY MORE.,"of 'The Platonist' _par excellence_. In 1639, he graduated M.A.; and the"
22358,DR HENRY MORE.,"next year, he published the first part of 'Psychozoia; or, The Song of"
22359,DR HENRY MORE.,"the Soul,' containing a Christiano-Platonical account of Man and Life."
22360,DR HENRY MORE.,"In preparing the materials of this poem, he had studied all the"
22361,DR HENRY MORE.,"principal Platonists and mystical writers, and is said to have read"
22362,DR HENRY MORE.,"himself almost to a shadow. And not only was his body emaciated, but"
22363,DR HENRY MORE.,"his mind was so overstrung, that he imagined himself to see spiritual"
22364,DR HENRY MORE.,"beings, to hear supernatural voices, and to converse, like Socrates,"
22365,DR HENRY MORE.,"with a particular genius. He thought, too, that his body 'exhaled the"
22366,DR HENRY MORE.,"perfume of violets!' Notwithstanding these little peculiarities, his"
22367,DR HENRY MORE.,"genius and his learning, the simplicity of his character, and the"
22368,DR HENRY MORE.,"innocence of his life, rendered him a general favourite; he was made"
22369,DR HENRY MORE.,"a fellow of his college, and became a tutor to various persons of"
22370,DR HENRY MORE.,"distinguished rank. One of these was Sir John Finch, whose sister, Lady"
22371,DR HENRY MORE.,"Conway, an enthusiast herself, brought More acquainted with the famous"
22372,DR HENRY MORE.,"John Baptist Van Helment, a man after whom, in the beginning of the"
22373,DR HENRY MORE.,"seventeenth century, the whole of Europe wondered. He was a follower and"
22374,DR HENRY MORE.,"imitator of Paracelsus, like him affected universal knowledge, aspired"
22375,DR HENRY MORE.,"to revolutionise the science of medicine, and died with the reputation"
22376,DR HENRY MORE.,"of one who, with great powers and acquirements, instead of becoming a"
22377,DR HENRY MORE.,"great man, ended as a brilliant pretender, and was rather an 'architect"
22378,DR HENRY MORE.,"of ruin' to the systems of others, than the founder of a solid fabric of"
22379,DR HENRY MORE.,"his own. More admired, of course, not the quackery, but the adventurous"
22380,DR HENRY MORE.,"boldness of Helment's genius, and his devotion to chemistry; which is"
22381,DR HENRY MORE.,"certainly the most spiritual of all the sciences, and must, especially"
22382,DR HENRY MORE.,"in its transcendental forms, have had a great charm for a Platonic"
22383,DR HENRY MORE.,"thinker. Our author was entirely devoted to study, and resisted every"
22384,DR HENRY MORE.,inducement to leave what he called his 'Paradise' at Cambridge. His
22385,DR HENRY MORE.,"friends once tried to decoy him into a bishopric, and got him the length"
22386,DR HENRY MORE.,of Whitehall to kiss the king's hand on the occasion; but when he
22387,DR HENRY MORE.,"understood their purpose, he refused to go a single step further. His"
22388,DR HENRY MORE.,"life was a long, learned, happy, and holy dream. He was of the most"
22389,DR HENRY MORE.,"benevolent disposition; and once observed to a friend, 'that he was"
22390,DR HENRY MORE.,"thought by some to have a soft head, but he thanked God he had a soft"
22391,DR HENRY MORE.,"heart.' In the heat of the Rebellion, the Republicans spared More,"
22392,DR HENRY MORE.,"although he had refused to take the Covenant. Campbell says of him,"
22393,DR HENRY MORE.,"'He corresponded with Descartes, was the friend of Cudworth, and, as a"
22394,DR HENRY MORE.,"divine and a moralist, was not only popular in his own time, but has"
22395,DR HENRY MORE.,been mentioned with admiration both by Addison and Blair.' One is rather
22396,DR HENRY MORE.,"amused at the latter clause. That a man of More's massive learning,"
22397,DR HENRY MORE.,"noble eloquence, and divine genius should need the testimony of a mere"
22398,DR HENRY MORE.,"elegant wordmonger like Blair, seems ludicrous enough; and Addison"
22399,DR HENRY MORE.,"himself, except in wit and humour, was not worthy to have untied the"
22400,DR HENRY MORE.,shoelatchets of the old Platonist. We were first introduced to this
22401,DR HENRY MORE.,"writer by good Dr John Brown, late of Broughton Place, Edinburgh, and"
22402,DR HENRY MORE.,"shall never forget hearing him, in his library, read some splendid"
22403,DR HENRY MORE.,"passages from More's work, in those deep, mellow, antique tones which"
22404,DR HENRY MORE.,"flavoured whatever he read, like the crust on old wine. His chief works"
22405,DR HENRY MORE.,"are, 'A Discourse on the Immortality of the Soul,' 'The Mystery of"
22406,DR HENRY MORE.,"Godliness,' 'The Mystery of Iniquity,' 'Divine Dialogues,' 'An Antidote"
22407,DR HENRY MORE.,"against Atheism,' 'Ethical and Metaphysical Manuals,' &c. In writing"
22408,DR HENRY MORE.,"such books, and pursuing the recondite studies of which they were the"
22409,DR HENRY MORE.,"fruit, More spent his life happily. In 1661, he became a Fellow of"
22410,DR HENRY MORE.,"the Royal Society. For twenty years after the Restoration, his works"
22411,DR HENRY MORE.,are said to have sold better than any of their day--a curious and
22412,DR HENRY MORE.,"unaccountable fact, considering the levity and licentiousness of the"
22413,DR HENRY MORE.,"period. In September 1687, the fine old spiritualist, aged seventy-"
22414,DR HENRY MORE.,"three, went away to that land of 'ideas' to which his heart had been"
22415,DR HENRY MORE.,translated long before.
22416,DR HENRY MORE.,
22417,DR HENRY MORE.,"More's prose writings give us, on the whole, a higher idea of his powers"
22418,DR HENRY MORE.,"than his poem. This is not exactly, as a recent critic calls it, 'dull"
22419,DR HENRY MORE.,"and tedious,' but it is in some parts prosaic, and in others obscure."
22420,DR HENRY MORE.,"The gleams of fancy in it are genuine, but few and far between. But his"
22421,DR HENRY MORE.,"prose works constitute, like those of Cudworth, Charnock, Jeremy Taylor,"
22422,DR HENRY MORE.,"and John Scott, a vast old quarry, abounding both in blocks and in gems"
22423,DR HENRY MORE.,"--blocks of granite solidity, and gems of starry lustre. The peculiarity"
22424,DR HENRY MORE.,"of More is in that poetico-philosophic mist which, like the autumnal"
22425,DR HENRY MORE.,"gossamer, hangs in light and beautiful festoons over his thoughts, and"
22426,DR HENRY MORE.,which suggests pleasing memories of Plato and the Alexandrian school.
22427,DR HENRY MORE.,"Like all the followers of the Grecian sage, he dwells in a region of"
22428,DR HENRY MORE.,"'ideas,' which are to him the only realities, and are not cold, but"
22429,DR HENRY MORE.,warm; he sees all things in Divine solution; the visible is lost in the
22430,DR HENRY MORE.,"invisible, and nature retires before her God. Surely they are splendid"
22431,DR HENRY MORE.,reveries those of the Platonic school; but it is sad to reflect that
22432,DR HENRY MORE.,"they have not cast the slightest gleam of light on the dark, frightful,"
22433,DR HENRY MORE.,faith-shattering mysteries which perplex all inquirers. The old shadows
22434,DR HENRY MORE.,"of sin, death, damnation, evil, and hell, are found to darken the 'ideas'"
22435,DR HENRY MORE.,"of Plato's world quite as deeply as they do the actualities of this weary,"
22436,DR HENRY MORE.,"work-day earth, into which men have, for some inscrutable purpose, been"
22437,DR HENRY MORE.,"sent to be, on the whole, miserable,--so often to toil without compen-"
22438,DR HENRY MORE.,"sation, to suffer without benefit, and to hope without fulfilment."

22775,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"taste, too, was finical at times, says of Vaughan--'He is one of the"
22776,HENRY VAUGHAN.,harshest even of the inferior order of the school of conceit; but he has
22777,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"some few scattered thoughts that meet the eye amidst his harsh pages,"
22778,HENRY VAUGHAN.,like wild flowers on a barren heath.' Surely this is rather 'harsh'
22779,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"judgment. At the same time, it is not a little laughable to find that"
22780,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Campbell has himself appropriated one of these 'wild flowers.' In his
22781,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"beautiful 'Rainbow,' he cries--"
22782,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22783,HENRY VAUGHAN.,'How came the world's gray fathers forth
22784,HENRY VAUGHAN.,To mark thy sacred sign!'
22785,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22786,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Vaughan had said--
22787,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22788,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"'How bright wert thou, when Shem's admiring eye,"
22789,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Thy burnished, flaming arch did first descry;"
22790,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"When Terah, Nahor, Haran, Abram, Lot,"
22791,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"The youthful world's gray fathers in one knot,"
22792,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Did with intentive looks watch every hour
22793,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"For thy new light, and trembled at each shower!'"
22794,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22795,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Indeed, all Campbell's 'Rainbow' is just a reflection of Vaughan's, and"
22796,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"reminds you of those faint, pale shadows of the heavenly bow you"
22797,HENRY VAUGHAN.,sometimes see in the darkened and disarranged skies of spring. To steal
22798,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"from, and then strike down the victim, is more suitable to robbers than"
22799,HENRY VAUGHAN.,to poets.
22800,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22801,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Perhaps the best criticism on Vaughan may be found in the title of his
22802,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"own poems, 'Silex Scintillans.' He had a good deal of the dulness and"
22803,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"hardness of the flint about his mind, but the influence of poverty and"
22804,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"suffering,--for true it is that"
22805,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22806,HENRY VAUGHAN.,'Wretched men
22807,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Are cradled into poetry by wrong;
22808,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"They learn in suffering what they teach in song,'--"
22809,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
22810,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"and latterly the power of a genuine, though somewhat narrow piety,"
22811,HENRY VAUGHAN.,struck out glorious scintillations from the bare but rich rock. He ranks
22812,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"with Crashaw, Quarles, and Herbert, as one of the best of our early"
22813,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"religious poets; like them in their faults, and superior to all of them"
22814,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"in refinement and beauty, if not in strength of genius."

24240,MISERY.,"And having thus performed that part,"
24241,MISERY.,Feed on those vomits of my heart.
24242,MISERY.,I break the fence my own hands made
24243,MISERY.,Then lay that trespass in the shade;
24244,MISERY.,"Some fig-leaves still I do devise,"
24245,MISERY.,As if thou hadst not ears nor eyes.
24246,MISERY.,"Excess of friends, of words, and wine"
24247,MISERY.,"Take up my day, while thou dost shine"
24248,MISERY.,"All unregarded, and thy book"
24249,MISERY.,Hath not so much as one poor look.
24250,MISERY.,If thou steal in amidst the mirth
24251,MISERY.,"And kindly tell me, I am earth,"
24252,MISERY.,"I shut thee out, and let that slip;"
24253,MISERY.,Such music spoils good fellowship.
24254,MISERY.,"Thus wretched I and most unkind,"
24255,MISERY.,"Exclude my dear God from my mind,"
24256,MISERY.,"Exclude him thence, who of that cell"
24257,MISERY.,"Would make a court, should he there dwell."
24258,MISERY.,"He goes, he yields; and troubled sore"
24259,MISERY.,His Holy Spirit grieves therefore;
24260,MISERY.,"The mighty God, the eternal King"
24261,MISERY.,"Doth grieve for dust, and dust doth sing."
24262,MISERY.,"But I go on, haste to divest"
24263,MISERY.,"Myself of reason, till oppressed"
24264,MISERY.,"And buried in my surfeits, I"
24265,MISERY.,Prove my own shame and misery.
24266,MISERY.,Next day I call and cry for thee
24267,MISERY.,Who shouldst not then come near to me;
24268,MISERY.,"But now it is thy servant's pleasure,"
24269,MISERY.,Thou must and dost give him his measure.
24270,MISERY.,"Thou dost, thou com'st, and in a shower"
24271,MISERY.,Of healing sweets thyself dost pour
24272,MISERY.,Into my wounds; and now thy grace
24273,MISERY.,(I know it well) fills all the place;
24274,MISERY.,"I sit with thee by this new light,"
24275,MISERY.,And for that hour thou'rt my delight;
24276,MISERY.,"No man can more the world despise,"
24277,MISERY.,Or thy great mercies better prize.
24278,MISERY.,"I school my eyes, and strictly dwell"
24279,MISERY.,Within the circle of my cell;
24280,MISERY.,"That calm and silence are my joys,"
24281,MISERY.,Which to thy peace are but mere noise.
24282,MISERY.,"At length I feel my head to ache,"
24283,MISERY.,"My fingers itch, and burn to take"
24284,MISERY.,"Some new employment, I begin"
24285,MISERY.,To swell and foam and fret within:
24286,MISERY.,"'The age, the present times are not"
24287,MISERY.,To snudge in and embrace a cot;
24288,MISERY.,"Action and blood now get the game,"
24289,MISERY.,Disdain treads on the peaceful name;
24290,MISERY.,Who sits at home too bears a load
24291,MISERY.,Greater than those that gad abroad.'
24292,MISERY.,Thus do I make thy gifts given me
24293,MISERY.,The only quarrellers with thee;
24294,MISERY.,"I'd loose those knots thy hands did tie,"
24295,MISERY.,"Then would go travel, fight, or die."
24296,MISERY.,Thousands of wild and waste infusions
24297,MISERY.,Like waves beat on my resolutions;
24298,MISERY.,"As flames about their fuel run,"
24299,MISERY.,"And work and wind till all be done,"
24300,MISERY.,"So my fierce soul bustles about,"
24301,MISERY.,And never rests till all be out.
24302,MISERY.,"Thus wilded by a peevish heart,"
24303,MISERY.,"Which in thy music bears no part,"
24304,MISERY.,"I storm at thee, calling my peace"
24305,MISERY.,"A lethargy, and mere disease;"
24306,MISERY.,Nay those bright beams shot from thy eyes
24307,MISERY.,"To calm me in these mutinies,"
24308,MISERY.,"I style mere tempers, which take place"
24309,MISERY.,"At some set times, but are thy grace."
24310,MISERY.,
24311,MISERY.,"Such is man's life, and such is mine,"
24312,MISERY.,"The worst of men, and yet still thine,"
24313,MISERY.,"Still thine, thou know'st, and if not so,"
24314,MISERY.,Then give me over to my foe.
24315,MISERY.,Yet since as easy 'tis for thee
24316,MISERY.,"To make man good as bid him be,"
24317,MISERY.,"And with one glance, could he that gain,"
24318,MISERY.,"To look him out of all his pain,"
24319,MISERY.,"Oh, send me from thy holy hill"
24320,MISERY.,So much of strength as may fulfil
24321,MISERY.,"All thy delights, whate'er they be,"
24322,MISERY.,And sacred institutes in me!
24323,MISERY.,"Open my rocky heart, and fill"
24324,MISERY.,It with obedience to thy will;
24325,MISERY.,"Then seal it up, that as none see,"
24326,MISERY.,So none may enter there but thee.
24327,MISERY.,
24328,MISERY.,"Oh, hear, my God! hear him, whose blood"
24329,MISERY.,Speaks more and better for my good!
24330,MISERY.,"Oh, let my cry come to thy throne!"
24331,MISERY.,"My cry not poured with tears alone,"
24332,MISERY.,"(For tears alone are often foul,)"
24333,MISERY.,But with the blood of all my soul;
24334,MISERY.,"With spirit-sighs, and earnest groans,"
24335,MISERY.,"Faithful and most repenting moans,"
24336,MISERY.,"With these I cry, and crying pine,"

24615,PSALM CIV.,
24616,PSALM CIV.,3  The beams of thy bright chambers thou dost lay
24617,PSALM CIV.,"In the deep waters, which no eye can find;"
24618,PSALM CIV.,"The clouds thy chariots are, and thy pathway"
24619,PSALM CIV.,The wings of the swift wind.
24620,PSALM CIV.,
24621,PSALM CIV.,"4  In thy celestial, gladsome messages"
24622,PSALM CIV.,"Despatched to holy souls, sick with desire"
24623,PSALM CIV.,"And love of thee, each willing angel is"
24624,PSALM CIV.,Thy minister in fire.
24625,PSALM CIV.,
24626,PSALM CIV.,5  Thy arm unmoveable for ever laid
24627,PSALM CIV.,And founded the firm earth; then with the deep
24628,PSALM CIV.,As with a vail thou hidd'st it; thy floods played
24629,PSALM CIV.,Above the mountains steep.
24630,PSALM CIV.,
24631,PSALM CIV.,"6  At thy rebuke they fled, at the known voice"
24632,PSALM CIV.,Of their Lord's thunder they retired apace:
24633,PSALM CIV.,"Some up the mountains passed by secret ways,"
24634,PSALM CIV.,Some downwards to their place.
24635,PSALM CIV.,
24636,PSALM CIV.,"7  For thou to them a bound hast set, a bound"
24637,PSALM CIV.,"Which, though but sand, keeps in and curbs whole seas:"
24638,PSALM CIV.,"There all their fury, foam, and hideous sound,"
24639,PSALM CIV.,Must languish and decrease.
24640,PSALM CIV.,
24641,PSALM CIV.,"8  And as thy care bounds these, so thy rich love"
24642,PSALM CIV.,"Doth broach the earth; and lesser brooks lets forth,"
24643,PSALM CIV.,"Which run from hills to valleys, and improve"
24644,PSALM CIV.,Their pleasure and their worth.
24645,PSALM CIV.,
24646,PSALM CIV.,9  These to the beasts of every field give drink;
24647,PSALM CIV.,There the wild asses swallow the cool spring:
24648,PSALM CIV.,And birds amongst the branches on their brink
24649,PSALM CIV.,"Their dwellings have, and sing."
24650,PSALM CIV.,
24651,PSALM CIV.,"10 Thou from thy upper springs above, from those"
24652,PSALM CIV.,"Chambers of rain, where heaven's large bottles lie,"
24653,PSALM CIV.,"Dost water the parched hills, whose breaches close,"
24654,PSALM CIV.,Healed by the showers from high.
24655,PSALM CIV.,
24656,PSALM CIV.,"11 Grass for the cattle, and herbs for man's use"
24657,PSALM CIV.,"Thou mak'st to grow; these, blessed by thee, the earth"
24658,PSALM CIV.,"Brings forth, with wine, oil, bread; all which infuse"
24659,PSALM CIV.,To man's heart strength and mirth.
24660,PSALM CIV.,
24661,PSALM CIV.,"12 Thou giv'st the trees their greenness, even to those"
24662,PSALM CIV.,"Cedars in Lebanon, in whose thick boughs"
24663,PSALM CIV.,The birds their nests build; though the stork doth choose
24664,PSALM CIV.,The fir-trees for her house.
24665,PSALM CIV.,
24666,PSALM CIV.,"13 To the wild goats the high hills serve for folds,"
24667,PSALM CIV.,The rocks give conies a retiring place:
24668,PSALM CIV.,"Above them the cool moon her known course holds,"
24669,PSALM CIV.,And the sun runs his race.
24670,PSALM CIV.,
24671,PSALM CIV.,"14 Thou makest darkness, and then comes the night,"
24672,PSALM CIV.,In whose thick shades and silence each wild beast
24673,PSALM CIV.,"Creeps forth, and, pinched for food, with scent and sight"
24674,PSALM CIV.,Hunts in an eager quest.
24675,PSALM CIV.,
24676,PSALM CIV.,"15 The lion's whelps, impatient of delay,"
24677,PSALM CIV.,"Roar in the covert of the woods, and seek"
24678,PSALM CIV.,"Their meat from thee, who dost appoint the prey,"
24679,PSALM CIV.,And feed'st them all the week.
24680,PSALM CIV.,
24681,PSALM CIV.,"16 This past, the sun shines on the earth; and they"
24682,PSALM CIV.,Retire into their dens; man goes abroad
24683,PSALM CIV.,"Unto his work, and at the close of day"
24684,PSALM CIV.,Returns home with his load.
24685,PSALM CIV.,
24686,PSALM CIV.,"17 O Lord my God, how many and how rare"
24687,PSALM CIV.,Are thy great works! In wisdom hast thou made
24688,PSALM CIV.,"Them all; and this the earth, and every blade"
24689,PSALM CIV.,Of grass we tread declare.
24690,PSALM CIV.,
24691,PSALM CIV.,"18 So doth the deep and wide sea, wherein are"
24692,PSALM CIV.,"Innumerable creeping things, both small"
24693,PSALM CIV.,"And great; there ships go, and the shipmen's fear,"
24694,PSALM CIV.,"The comely, spacious whale."
24695,PSALM CIV.,
24696,PSALM CIV.,"19 These all upon thee wait, that thou mayst feed"
24697,PSALM CIV.,Them in due season: what thou giv'st they take;
24698,PSALM CIV.,"Thy bounteous open hand helps them at need,"
24699,PSALM CIV.,And plenteous meals they make.
24700,PSALM CIV.,
24701,PSALM CIV.,"20 When thou dost hide thy face, (thy face which keeps"
24702,PSALM CIV.,"All things in being,) they consume and mourn:"
24703,PSALM CIV.,"When thou withdraw'st their breath their vigour sleeps,"
24704,PSALM CIV.,And they to dust return.
24705,PSALM CIV.,
24706,PSALM CIV.,"21 Thou send'st thy Spirit forth, and they revive,"
24707,PSALM CIV.,The frozen earth's dead face thou dost renew.
24708,PSALM CIV.,"Thus thou thy glory through the world dost drive,"
24709,PSALM CIV.,And to thy works art true.
24710,PSALM CIV.,
24711,PSALM CIV.,"22 Thine eyes behold the earth, and the whole stage"
24712,PSALM CIV.,"Is moved and trembles, the hills melt and smoke"
24713,PSALM CIV.,With thy least touch; lightnings and winds that rage
24714,PSALM CIV.,At thy rebuke are broke.
24715,PSALM CIV.,
24716,PSALM CIV.,23 Therefore as long as thou wilt give me breath
24717,PSALM CIV.,I will in songs to thy great name employ
24718,PSALM CIV.,"That gift of thine, and to my day of death"
24719,PSALM CIV.,Thou shalt be all my joy.
24720,PSALM CIV.,
24721,PSALM CIV.,"24 I'll spice my thoughts with thee, and from thy word"
24722,PSALM CIV.,Gather true comforts; but the wicked liver
24723,PSALM CIV.,"Shall be consumed. O my soul, bless thy Lord!"

24730,THE TIMBER.,"Many bright mornings, much dew, many showers"
24731,THE TIMBER.,"Passed o'er thy head; many light hearts and wings,"
24732,THE TIMBER.,"Which now are dead, lodged in thy living bowers."
24733,THE TIMBER.,
24734,THE TIMBER.,2  And still a new succession sings and flies;
24735,THE TIMBER.,"Fresh groves grow up, and their green branches shoot"
24736,THE TIMBER.,"Towards the old and still-enduring skies,"
24737,THE TIMBER.,While the low violet thrives at their root.
24738,THE TIMBER.,
24739,THE TIMBER.,"3  But thou, beneath the sad and heavy line"
24740,THE TIMBER.,"Of death, doth waste all senseless, cold, and dark;"
24741,THE TIMBER.,"Where not so much as dreams of light may shine,"
24742,THE TIMBER.,"Nor any thought of greenness, leaf, or bark."
24743,THE TIMBER.,
24744,THE TIMBER.,"4  And yet, as if some deep hate and dissent,"
24745,THE TIMBER.,"Bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee,"
24746,THE TIMBER.,"Were still alive, thou dost great storms resent,"
24747,THE TIMBER.,"Before they come, and know'st how near they be."
24748,THE TIMBER.,
24749,THE TIMBER.,"5  Else all at rest thou liest, and the fierce breath"
24750,THE TIMBER.,Of tempests can no more disturb thy ease;
24751,THE TIMBER.,But this thy strange resentment after death
24752,THE TIMBER.,Means only those who broke in life thy peace.
24753,THE TIMBER.,
24754,THE TIMBER.,"6  So murdered man, when lovely life is done,"
24755,THE TIMBER.,"And his blood freezed, keeps in the centre still"
24756,THE TIMBER.,"Some secret sense, which makes the dead blood run"
24757,THE TIMBER.,At his approach that did the body kill.
24758,THE TIMBER.,
24759,THE TIMBER.,7  And is there any murderer worse than sin?
24760,THE TIMBER.,Or any storms more foul than a lewd life?
24761,THE TIMBER.,Or what resentient can work more within
24762,THE TIMBER.,"Than true remorse, when with past sins at strife?"
24763,THE TIMBER.,
24764,THE TIMBER.,"8  He that hath left life's vain joys and vain care,"
24765,THE TIMBER.,"And truly hates to be detained on earth,"
24766,THE TIMBER.,"Hath got an house where many mansions are,"
24767,THE TIMBER.,And keeps his soul unto eternal mirth.
24768,THE TIMBER.,
24769,THE TIMBER.,"9  But though thus dead unto the world, and ceased"
24770,THE TIMBER.,"From sin, he walks a narrow, private way;"
24771,THE TIMBER.,"Yet grief and old wounds make him sore displeased,"
24772,THE TIMBER.,"And all his life a rainy, weeping day."
24773,THE TIMBER.,
24774,THE TIMBER.,"10 For though he should forsake the world, and live"
24775,THE TIMBER.,As mere a stranger as men long since dead;
24776,THE TIMBER.,Yet joy itself will make a right soul grieve
24777,THE TIMBER.,To think he should be so long vainly led.
24778,THE TIMBER.,
24779,THE TIMBER.,"11 But as shades set off light, so tears and grief,"
24780,THE TIMBER.,"Though of themselves but a sad blubbered story,"
24781,THE TIMBER.,"By showing the sin great, show the relief"
24782,THE TIMBER.,"Far greater, and so speak my Saviour's glory."
24783,THE TIMBER.,
24784,THE TIMBER.,"12 If my way lies through deserts and wild woods,"
24785,THE TIMBER.,Where all the land with scorching heat is cursed;
24786,THE TIMBER.,Better the pools should flow with rain and floods
24787,THE TIMBER.,"To fill my bottle, than I die with thirst."
24788,THE TIMBER.,
24789,THE TIMBER.,"13 Blest showers they are, and streams sent from above;"
24790,THE TIMBER.,Begetting virgins where they use to flow;
24791,THE TIMBER.,"The trees of life no other waters love,"
24792,THE TIMBER.,"Than upper springs, and none else make them grow."
24793,THE TIMBER.,
24794,THE TIMBER.,14 But these chaste fountains flow not till we die.
24795,THE TIMBER.,Some drops may fall before; but a clear spring
24796,THE TIMBER.,"And ever running, till we leave to fling"
24797,THE TIMBER.,"Dirt in her way, will keep above the sky."

24839,THE JEWS.,"His only Son to make it free,"
24840,THE JEWS.,Whose Spirit too doth mourn and grieve
24841,THE JEWS.,"To see man lost, will for old love"

24843,THE JEWS.,
24844,THE JEWS.,"4 Faith sojourned first on earth in you,"
24845,THE JEWS.,You were the dear and chosen stock:

25549,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"This writer, though little known, appears to us to stand as high almost"
25550,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"as any name in the present volume, and we are proud to reprint here some"
25551,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,considerable specimens of his magnificent poetry.
25552,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
25553,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,Joseph Beaumont was sprung from a collateral branch of the ancient
25554,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"family of the Beaumonts, that family from which sprung Sir John Beaumont,"
25555,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"the author of 'Bosworth Field,' and Francis Beaumont, the celebrated"
25556,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"dramatist. He was born at Hadleigh, in Suffolk. Of his early life nothing"
25557,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"is known. He received his education at Cambridge, where, during the Civil"
25558,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"War, he was fellow and tutor of Peterhouse. Ejected by the Republicans"
25559,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"from his offices, he retired to Hadleigh, and spent his time in the com-"
25560,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"position of his _magnum opus_, 'Psyche.' This poem appeared in 1648; and"
25561,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"in 1702, three years after the author's death, his son published a second"
25562,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"edition, with numerous corrections, and the addition of four cantos by the"
25563,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"author. Beaumont also wrote several minor pieces in English and Latin, a"
25564,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"controversial tract in reply to Henry More's 'Mystery of Godliness,' and"
25565,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"several theological works which are still in MS., according to a provision"
25566,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,in his will to that effect. Peace and perpetuity to their slumbers!
25567,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
25568,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"After the Restoration, our author was not only reinstated in his former"
25569,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"situations, but received from his patron, Bishop Wren, several valuable"
25570,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"pieces of preferment besides. Afterwards, he exercised successively the"
25571,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"offices of Master of Jesus and of Peterhouse, and was King's Professor"
25572,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,of Divinity from 1670 to 1699. In the latter year he died.
25573,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
25574,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"While praising the genius of Beaumont, we are far from commending his"
25575,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"'Psyche,' either as an artistic whole, or as a readable book. It is,"
25576,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"sooth to say, a dull allegory, in twenty-four immense cantos, studded"
25577,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,with the rarest beauties. It is considerably longer than the 'Faery
25578,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Queen,' nearly four times the length of the 'Paradise Lost,' and five or"
25579,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,six times as long as the 'Excursion.' To read it through now-a-days were
25580,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,to perform a purgatorial penance. But the imagination and fancy are
25581,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Spenserian, his colouring is often Titianesque in gorgeousness, and his"
25582,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"pictures of shadows, abstractions, and all fantastic forms, are so"
25583,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"forcible as to seem to start from the canvas. In painting the beautiful,"
25584,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,his verse becomes careless and flowing as a loosened zone; in painting
25585,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"the frightful and the infernal, his language, like his feeling, seems to"
25586,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"curdle and stiffen in horror, as where, speaking of Satan, he says--"
25587,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
25588,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,'His tawny teeth
25589,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Were ragged grown, by endless _gnashing at"
25590,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,The dismal riddle of his living death._'
25591,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
25592,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"The 'Psyche' may be compared to a palace of Fairyland, where successive"
25593,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,doors fly open to the visitor--one revealing a banqueting-room filled
25594,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"with the materials of exuberant mirth; another, an enchanted garden,"
25595,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"with streams stealing from grottos, and nymphs gliding through groves;"
25596,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,a third conducting you to a dungeon full of dead men's bones and all
25597,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"uncleanness; a fourth, to a pit which seems the mouth of hell, and"
25598,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"whence cries of torture come up, shaking the smoke that ascendeth up for"
25599,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"ever and ever; and a fifth, to the open roof, over which the stars are"
25600,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"seen bending, and the far-off heavens are opening in glory; and of these"
25601,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"doors there is no end. We saw, when lately in Copenhagen, the famous"
25602,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"tower of the Trinity Church, remarkable for the grand view commanded"
25603,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"from the summit, and for the broad spiral ascent winding within it"
25604,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"almost to the top, up which it is said Peter the Great, in 1716, used to"
25605,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,drive himself and his Empress in a coach-and-four. It was curious to
25606,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"feel ourselves ascending on a path nearly level, and without the"
25607,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"slightest perspiration or fatigue; and here, we thought, is the"
25608,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,desiderated 'royal road' to difficulties fairly found. Large poems
25609,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"should be constructed on the same principle; their quiet, broad interest"
25610,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,should beguile their readers alike to their length and their loftiness.
25611,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,It is exactly the reverse with 'Psyche.' But if any reader is wearied of
25612,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"some of the extracts we have given, such as his verses on 'Eve,' on"
25613,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"'Paradise,' on 'End,' on 'The Death of his Wife,' and on 'Imperial"
25614,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Rome,' we shall be very much disposed to question his capacity for"
25615,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,appreciating true poetry.

25719,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,8 Now complimental Mercury was come
25720,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"To the quaint margin of his courtly sphere,"
25721,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,And bid us eloquent welcome to his home.
25722,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Scarce could we pass, so great a crowd was there"
25723,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Of points and lines; and nimble Wit beside
25724,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Upon the back of thousand shapes did ride.
25725,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25726,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"9 Next Venus' face, heaven's joy and sweetest pride,"
25727,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"(Which brought again my mother to my mind,)"
25728,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Into her region lured my ravished guide.
25729,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"This strewed with youth, and smiles, and love we find;"
25730,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,And those all chaste: 'tis this foul world below

25732,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25733,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"10 Then rapt to Phoebus' orb, all paved with gold,"

25735,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Most gladly there I would have stayed, and told"
25736,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"How many crowns and thorns his dwelling decked,"
25737,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"What life, what verdure, what heroic might,"
25738,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"What pearly spirits, what sons of active light."
25739,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25740,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"11 But I was hurried into Mars his sphere,"
25741,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Where Envy, (oh, how cursed was its grim face!)"
25742,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"And Jealousy, and Fear, and Wrath, and War"
25743,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Quarrelled, although in heaven, about their place."
25744,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Yea, engines there to vomit fire I saw,"
25745,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Whose flame and thunder earth at length must know.
25746,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25747,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"12 Nay, in a corner, 'twas my hap to spy"
25748,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Something which looked but frowardly on me:
25749,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,And sure my watchful guide read in mine eye
25750,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"My musing troubled sense; for straightway he,"
25751,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Lest I should start and wake upon the fright,"
25752,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Speeded from thence his seasonable flight.
25753,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25754,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"13 Welcome was Jupiter's dominion, where"
25755,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Illustrious Mildness round about did flow;
25756,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Religion had built her temple there,"
25757,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,And sacred honours on its walks did grow:
25758,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"No mitre ever priest's grave head shall crown,"
25759,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Which in those mystic gardens was not sown.
25760,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25761,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"14 At length, we found old Saturn in his bed;"
25762,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"And much I wondered how, and he so dull,"
25763,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Could climb thus high: his house was lumpish lead,"
25764,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Of dark and solitary comers full;
25765,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Where Discontent and Sickness dwellers be,"
25766,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Damned Melancholy and dead Lethargy.
25767,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,
25768,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"15 Hasting from hence into a boundless field,"
25769,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Innumerable stars we marshalled found
25770,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,In fair array: this earth did never yield
25771,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"Such choice of flowery pride, when she had crowned"
25772,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,"The plains of Shechem, where the gaudy Spring"
25773,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,Smiles on the beauties of each verdant thing.

25780,PARADISE.,Where living crystal found a sweet pretence
25781,PARADISE.,"With musical impatience to flow,"
25782,PARADISE.,And delicately chide the gems beneath
25783,PARADISE.,Because no smoother they had paved its path.
25784,PARADISE.,
25785,PARADISE.,2 The nymphs which sported on this current's side
25786,PARADISE.,"Were milky Thoughts, tralucid, pure Desires,"
25787,PARADISE.,"Soft turtles' Kisses, Looks of virgin brides,"
25788,PARADISE.,"Sweet Coolness which nor needs nor feareth fires,"

25791,PARADISE.,
25792,PARADISE.,3 The early gales knocked gently at the door
25793,PARADISE.,"Of every flower, to bid the odours wake;"
25794,PARADISE.,"Which, catching in their softest arms, they bore"
25795,PARADISE.,"From bed to bed, and so returned them back"
25796,PARADISE.,"To their own lodgings, doubled by the blisses"
25797,PARADISE.,They sipped from their delicious brethren's kisses.
25798,PARADISE.,
25799,PARADISE.,4 Upon the wings of those enamouring breaths
25800,PARADISE.,"Refreshment, vigour, nimbleness attended;"
25801,PARADISE.,"Which, wheresoe'er they flew, cheered up their paths,"
25802,PARADISE.,And with fresh airs of life all things befriended:
25803,PARADISE.,For Heaven's sweet Spirit deigned his breath to join
25804,PARADISE.,And make the powers of these blasts divine.
25805,PARADISE.,
25806,PARADISE.,5 The goodly trees' bent arms their nobler load
25807,PARADISE.,Of fruit which blest oppression overbore:
25808,PARADISE.,"That orchard where the dragon warder stood,"
25809,PARADISE.,"For all its golden boughs, to this was poor,"
25810,PARADISE.,"To this, in which the greater serpent lay,"
25811,PARADISE.,"Though not to guard the trees, but to betray."
25812,PARADISE.,
25813,PARADISE.,6 Of fortitude there rose a stately row;
25814,PARADISE.,"Here, of munificence a thickset grove;"
25815,PARADISE.,"There, of wise industry a quickset grew;"
25816,PARADISE.,"Here, flourished a dainty copse of love;"

25821,PARADISE.,"Under whose sheltering shadow piety,"
25822,PARADISE.,"Devotion, mildness, friendship planted were;"
25823,PARADISE.,Next stood renown with head exalted high;
25824,PARADISE.,"Then twined together plenty, fatness, peace."
25825,PARADISE.,"O blessed place, where grew such things as these!"
25826,PARADISE.,

25828,EVE.,EVE.
25829,EVE.,
25830,EVE.,"1  Her spacious, polished forehead was the fair"
25831,EVE.,And lovely plain where gentle majesty
25832,EVE.,Walked in delicious state: her temples clear
25833,EVE.,"Pomegranate fragments, which rejoiced to lie"
25834,EVE.,"In dainty ambush, and peep through their cover"
25835,EVE.,Of amber-locks whose volume curled over.
25836,EVE.,
25837,EVE.,2  The fuller stream of her luxuriant hair
25838,EVE.,Poured down itself upon her ivory back:
25839,EVE.,In which soft flood ten thousand graces were
25840,EVE.,Sporting and dallying with every lock;
25841,EVE.,"The rival winds for kisses fell to fight,"
25842,EVE.,And raised a ruffling tempest of delight.
25843,EVE.,
25844,EVE.,"3  Two princely arches, of most equal measures,"
25845,EVE.,"Held up the canopy above her eyes,"
25846,EVE.,"And opened to the heavens far richer treasures,"
25847,EVE.,Than with their stars or sun e'er learn'd to rise:
25848,EVE.,"Those beams can ravish but the body's sight,"
25849,EVE.,These dazzle stoutest souls with mystic light.
25850,EVE.,
25851,EVE.,4  Two garrisons were these of conquering love;
25852,EVE.,"Two founts of life, of spirit, of joy, of grace;"
25853,EVE.,"Two easts in one fair heaven, no more above,"
25854,EVE.,But in the hemisphere of her own face;
25855,EVE.,Two thrones of gallantry; two shops of miracles;
25856,EVE.,Two shrines of deities; two silent oracles.
25857,EVE.,
25858,EVE.,5  For silence here could eloquently plead;
25859,EVE.,Here might the unseen soul be clearly read:
25860,EVE.,"Though gentle humours their mild mixture made,"
25861,EVE.,They proved a double burning-glass which shed
25862,EVE.,"Those living flames which, with enlivening darts,"
25863,EVE.,Shoot deaths of love into spectators' hearts.
25864,EVE.,
25865,EVE.,"6  'Twixt these, an alabaster promontory"
25866,EVE.,Sloped gently down to part each cheek from other;
25867,EVE.,"Where white and red strove for the fairer glory,"
25868,EVE.,Blending in sweet confusion together.
25869,EVE.,The rose and lily never joined were
25870,EVE.,In so divine a marriage as there.
25871,EVE.,
25872,EVE.,7  Couchant upon these precious cushionets
25873,EVE.,"Were thousand beauties, and as many smiles,"
25874,EVE.,"Chaste blandishments, and modest cooling heats,"
25875,EVE.,"Harmless temptations, and honest guiles."
25876,EVE.,"For heaven, though up betimes the maid to deck,"
25877,EVE.,Ne'er made Aurora's cheeks so fair and sleek.
25878,EVE.,
25879,EVE.,"8  Enamouring neatness, softness, pleasure, at"
25880,EVE.,Her gracious mouth in full retinue stood;
25881,EVE.,"For, next the eyes' bright glass, the soul at that"
25882,EVE.,Takes most delight to look and walk abroad.
25883,EVE.,"But at her lips two threads of scarlet lay,"
25884,EVE.,"Or two warm corals, to adorn the way,--"
25885,EVE.,
25886,EVE.,"9  The precious way whereby her breath and tongue,"
25887,EVE.,"Her odours and her honey, travelled,"
25888,EVE.,Which nicest critics would have judged among
25889,EVE.,Arabian or Hyblaean mountains bred.
25890,EVE.,"Indeed, the richer Araby in her"
25891,EVE.,Dear mouth and sweeter Hybla dwelling were.
25892,EVE.,
25893,EVE.,10 More gracefully its golden chapiter
25894,EVE.,No column of white marble e'er sustained
25895,EVE.,Than her round polished neck supported her
25896,EVE.,"Illustrious head, which there in triumph reigned."
25897,EVE.,"Yet neither would this pillar hardness know,"
25898,EVE.,Nor suffer cold to dwell amongst its snow.
25899,EVE.,
25900,EVE.,11 Her blessed bosom moderately rose
25901,EVE.,"With two soft mounts of lilies, whose fair top"
25902,EVE.,"A pair of pretty sister cherries chose,"
25903,EVE.,And there their living crimson lifted up.
25904,EVE.,The milky countenance of the hills confessed
25905,EVE.,What kind of springs within had made their nest.
25906,EVE.,
25907,EVE.,12 So leggiadrous were her snowy hands
25908,EVE.,That pleasure moved as any finger stirred:
25909,EVE.,Her virgin waxen arms were precious bands
25910,EVE.,And chains of love: her waist itself did gird
25911,EVE.,"With its own graceful slenderness, and tie"
25912,EVE.,Up delicacy's best epitome.
25913,EVE.,
25914,EVE.,"13 Fair politure walked all her body over,"
25915,EVE.,And symmetry rejoiced in every part;
25916,EVE.,"Soft and white sweetness was her native cover,"
25917,EVE.,From every member beauty shot a dart:
25918,EVE.,"From heaven to earth, from head to foot I mean,"
25919,EVE.,No blemish could by envy's self be seen.
25920,EVE.,
25921,EVE.,14 This was the first-born queen of gallantry;
25922,EVE.,"All gems compounded into one rich stone,"
25923,EVE.,All sweets knit into one conspiracy;
25924,EVE.,A constellation of all stars in one;
25925,EVE.,"Who, when she was presented to their view,"
25926,EVE.,Both paradise and nature dazzled grew.
25927,EVE.,
25928,EVE.,"15 Phoebus, who rode in glorious scorn's career"
25929,EVE.,"About the world, no sooner spied her face,"
25930,EVE.,"But fain he would have lingered, from his sphere"
25931,EVE.,"On this, though less, yet sweeter, heaven, to gaze"
25932,EVE.,"Till shame enforced him to lash on again,"
25933,EVE.,And clearer wash him in the western main.
25934,EVE.,
25935,EVE.,16 The smiling air was tickled with his high
25936,EVE.,"Prerogative of uncontrolled bliss,"
25937,EVE.,Embracing with entirest liberty
25938,EVE.,"A body soft, and sweet, and chaste as his."
25939,EVE.,All odorous gales that had but strength to stir
25940,EVE.,Came flocking in to beg perfumes of her.
25941,EVE.,
25942,EVE.,"17 The marigold her garish love forgot,"
25943,EVE.,And turned her homage to these fairer eyes;
25944,EVE.,"All flowers looked up, and dutifully shot"
25945,EVE.,"Their wonder hither, whence they saw arise"
25946,EVE.,"Unparching courteous lustre, which instead"

25949,EVE.,"18 The sturdiest trees, affected by her dear"

25951,EVE.,At their hard pith; whilst all the birds whose clear
25952,EVE.,"Pipes tossed mirth about the branches, felt"
25953,EVE.,The influence of her looks; for having let
25954,EVE.,"Their song fall down, their eyes on her they set."

27021,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,
27022,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,
27023,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,Sedley was one of those characters who exert a personal fascination over
27024,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,their own age without leaving any works behind them to perpetuate the
27025,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"charm to posterity. He was the son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford, in"
27026,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Kent, and was born in 1639. When the Restoration took place he repaired"
27027,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"to London, and plunged into all the licence of the time, shedding,"
27028,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"however, over the putrid pool the sheen of his wit, manners, and genius."
27029,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Charles was so delighted with him, that he is said to have asked him"
27030,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,whether he had not obtained a patent from Nature to be Apollo's viceroy.
27031,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"He cracked jests, issued lampoons, wrote poems and plays, and, despite"
27032,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"some great blunders, was universally admired and loved. When his comedy"
27033,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"of 'Bellamira' was acted, the roof fell in, and a few, including the"
27034,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"author, were slightly injured. When a parasite told him that the fire of"
27035,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"the play had blown up the poet, house and all, Sedley replied, 'No; the"
27036,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"play was so heavy that it broke down the house, and buried the poet in"
27037,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"his own rubbish.' Latterly he sobered down, entered parliament, attended"
27038,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"closely to public business, and became a determined opponent of the"
27039,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,arbitrary measures of James II. To this he was stimulated by a personal
27040,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"reason. James had seduced Sedley's daughter, and made her Countess of"
27041,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Dorchester. 'For making my daughter a countess,' the father said, 'I"
27042,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"have helped to make his daughter' (Mary, Princess of Orange,) 'a queen.'"
27043,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Sedley, thus talking, acting, and writing, lived on till he was sixty-"
27044,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,two years of age. He died in 1701.
27045,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,
27046,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"He has left nothing that the world can cherish, except such light and"
27047,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"graceful songs, sparkling rather with point than with poetry, as we"

27225,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
27226,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
27227,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"This noble earl was rather a patron of poets than a poet, and possessed"
27228,THE EARL OF DORSET.,more wit than genius. Charles Sackville was born on the 24th January
27229,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"1637. He was descended directly from the famous Thomas, Lord Buckhurst."
27230,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"He was educated under a private tutor, travelled in Italy, and returned"
27231,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"in time to witness the Restoration. In the first parliament thereafter,"
27232,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"he sat for East Grinstead, in Surrey, and might have distinguished"
27233,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"himself, had he not determined, in common with almost all the wits of"
27234,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"the time, to run a preliminary career of dissipation. What a proof of"
27235,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"the licentiousness of these times is to be found in the fact, that young"
27236,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Lord Buckhurst, Sir Charles Sedley, and Sir Thomas Ogle were fined for"
27237,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"exposing themselves, drunk and naked, in indecent postures on the public"
27238,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"street! In 1665, the erratic energies of Buckhurst found a more"
27239,THE EARL OF DORSET.,legitimate vent in the Dutch war. He attended the Duke of York in the
27240,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"great sea-fight of the 3d June, in which Opdam, the Dutch admiral, was,"
27241,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"with all his crew, blown up. He is said to have composed the song,"
27242,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"quoted afterwards, 'To all you ladies now at land,' on the evening"
27243,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"before the battle, although Dr Johnson (who observes that seldom any"
27244,THE EARL OF DORSET.,splendid story is wholly true) maintains that its composition cost him
27245,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"a whole week, and that he only retouched it on that remarkable evening."
27246,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Buckhurst was soon after made a gentleman of the bed-chamber, and"
27247,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"despatched on short embassies to France. In 1674, his uncle, James"
27248,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Cranfield, the Earl of Middlesex, died, and left him his estate, and"
27249,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"the next year the title, too, was conferred on him. In 1677, he became,"
27250,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"by the death of his father, Earl of Dorset, and inherited the family"
27251,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"estate. In 1684, his wife, whose name was Bagot, and by whom he had no"
27252,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"children, died, and he soon after married a daughter of the Earl of"
27253,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Northampton, who is said to have been celebrated both for understanding"
27254,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"and beauty. Dorset was courted by James, but found it impossible to"
27255,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"coincide with his violent measures, and when the bishops were tried"
27256,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"at Westminster Hall, he, along with some other lords, appeared to"
27257,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"countenance them. He concurred with the Revolution settlement, and,"
27258,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"after William's accession, was created lord chamberlain of the"
27259,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"household, and received the Order of the Garter. His attendance on the"
27260,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"king, however, eventually cost him his life, for having been tossed with"
27261,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"him in an open boat on the coast of Holland for sixteen hours, in very"
27262,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"rough weather, he caught an illness from which he never recovered. On"
27263,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"19th January 1705-6, he died at Bath."
27264,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
27265,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"During his life, Dorset was munificent in his kindness to such men of"
27266,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"genius as Prior and Dryden, who repaid him in the current coin of the"
27267,THE EARL OF DORSET.,poor Parnassus of their day--gross adulation. He is now remembered
27268,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"mainly for his spirited war-song, and for such pointed lines in his"
27269,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"satire on Edward Howard, the notorious author of 'British Princes,' as"
27270,THE EARL OF DORSET.,the following:--
27271,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
27272,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"'They lie, dear Ned, who say thy brain is barren,"
27273,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"When deep conceits, like maggots, breed in carrion;"

27386,JOHN PHILIPS.,Bampton in Oxfordshire was the birthplace of this poet. He was born
27387,JOHN PHILIPS.,"on the 30th of December 1676. His father, Dr Stephen Philips, was"
27388,JOHN PHILIPS.,"archdeacon of Salop, as well as minister of Bampton. John, after some"
27389,JOHN PHILIPS.,"preliminary training at home, was sent to Winchester, where he"
27390,JOHN PHILIPS.,"distinguished himself by diligence and good-nature, and enjoyed two"
27391,JOHN PHILIPS.,"great luxuries,--the reading of Milton, and the having his head combed"
27392,JOHN PHILIPS.,by some one while he sat still and in rapture for hours together. This
27393,JOHN PHILIPS.,"pleasure he shared with Vossius, and with humbler persons of our"
27394,JOHN PHILIPS.,"acquaintance; the combing of whose hair, they tell us,"
27395,JOHN PHILIPS.,
27396,JOHN PHILIPS.,"'Dissolves them into ecstasies,"
27397,JOHN PHILIPS.,And brings all heaven before their eyes.'
27398,JOHN PHILIPS.,
27399,JOHN PHILIPS.,"In 1694, he entered Christ Church, Cambridge. His intention was to"
27400,JOHN PHILIPS.,"prosecute the study of medicine, and he took great delight in the"
27401,JOHN PHILIPS.,cognate pursuits of natural history and botany. His chief friend was
27402,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Edmund Smith, (Rag Smith, as he was generally called,) a kind of minor"
27403,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Savage, well known in these times as the author of 'Phaedra and"
27404,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Hippolytus,' and for his cureless dissipation. In 1703, Philips produced"
27405,JOHN PHILIPS.,"'The Splendid Shilling,' which proved a hit, and seems to have diverted"
27406,JOHN PHILIPS.,his aspirations from the domains of Aesculapius to those of Apollo.
27407,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Bolingbroke sought him out, and employed him, after the battle of"
27408,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Blenheim, to sing it in opposition to Addison, the laureate of the"
27409,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Whigs. At the house of the magnificent but unprincipled St John, Philips"
27410,JOHN PHILIPS.,"wrote his 'Blenheim,' which was published in 1705. The year after, his"
27411,JOHN PHILIPS.,"'Cider,' a poem in two books, appeared, and was received with great"
27412,JOHN PHILIPS.,"applause. Encouraged by this, he projected a poem on the Last Day,"
27413,JOHN PHILIPS.,"which all who are aware of the difficulties of the subject, and the"
27414,JOHN PHILIPS.,"limitations of the author's genius, must rejoice that he never wrote."
27415,JOHN PHILIPS.,Consumption and asthma removed him prematurely on the 15th of February
27416,JOHN PHILIPS.,"1708, ere he had completed his thirty-third year. He was buried in"
27417,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Hereford Cathedral, and Sir Simon Harcourt, afterwards Lord Chancellor,"
27418,JOHN PHILIPS.,erected a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey.
27419,JOHN PHILIPS.,
27420,JOHN PHILIPS.,Bulwer somewhere records a story of John Martin in his early days. He
27421,JOHN PHILIPS.,"was, on one occasion, reduced to his last shilling. He had kept it, out"
27422,JOHN PHILIPS.,"of a heap, from a partiality to its appearance. It was very bright. He"
27423,JOHN PHILIPS.,"was compelled, at last, to part with it. He went out to a baker's shop"
27424,JOHN PHILIPS.,to purchase a loaf with his favourite shilling. He had got the loaf into
27425,JOHN PHILIPS.,"his hands, when the baker discovered that the shilling was a bad one,"
27426,JOHN PHILIPS.,"and poor Martin had to resign the loaf, and take back his dear, bright,"
27427,JOHN PHILIPS.,bad shilling once more. Length of time and cold criticism in like manner
27428,JOHN PHILIPS.,"have reduced John Philips to his solitary 'Splendid Shilling.' But,"
27429,JOHN PHILIPS.,"though bright, it is far from bad. It is one of the cleverest of"
27430,JOHN PHILIPS.,"parodies, and is perpetrated against one of those colossal works which"
27431,JOHN PHILIPS.,the smiles of a thousand caricatures were unable to injure. No great or
27432,JOHN PHILIPS.,good poem was ever hurt by its parody:--the 'Paradise Lost' was not by
27433,JOHN PHILIPS.,'The Splendid Shilling'--'The Last Man' of Campbell was not by 'The Last
27434,JOHN PHILIPS.,Man' of Hood--nor the 'Lines on the Burial of Sir John Moore' by their
27435,JOHN PHILIPS.,"witty, well-known caricature; and if 'The Vision of Judgment' by Southey"
27436,JOHN PHILIPS.,"was laughed into oblivion by Byron's poem with the same title, it was"
27437,JOHN PHILIPS.,"because Southey's original was neither good nor great. Philip's poem,"
27438,JOHN PHILIPS.,"too, is the first of the kind; and surely we should be thankful to the"
27439,JOHN PHILIPS.,author of the earliest effort in a style which has created so much
27440,JOHN PHILIPS.,innocent amusement. Dr Johnson speaks as if the pleasure arising from
27441,JOHN PHILIPS.,such productions implied a malignant 'momentary triumph over that
27442,JOHN PHILIPS.,"grandeur which had hitherto held its captives in admiration.' We think,"
27443,JOHN PHILIPS.,"on the contrary, that it springs from our deep interest in the original"
27444,JOHN PHILIPS.,"production, making us alive to the strange resemblance the caricature"
27445,JOHN PHILIPS.,"bears to it. It is our love that provokes our laughter, and hence the"
27446,JOHN PHILIPS.,admirers of the parodied poem are more delighted than its enemies. At
27447,JOHN PHILIPS.,"all events, it is by 'The Splendid Shilling' alone--and that principally"
27448,JOHN PHILIPS.,from its connexion with Milton's great work--that Philips is memorable.
27449,JOHN PHILIPS.,"His 'Cider' has soured with age, and the loud echo of his Blenheim"
27450,JOHN PHILIPS.,battle-piece has long since died away.

28052,THOMAS TICKELL.,
28053,THOMAS TICKELL.,
28054,THOMAS TICKELL.,Tickell is now chiefly remembered from his connexion with Addison. He
28055,THOMAS TICKELL.,"was born in 1686, at Bridekirk, near Carlisle. In April 1701, he became"
28056,THOMAS TICKELL.,"a member of Queen's College in Oxford. In 1708, he was made M.A., and"
28057,THOMAS TICKELL.,"two years after was chosen Fellow. He held his Fellowship till 1726,"
28058,THOMAS TICKELL.,"when, marrying in Dublin, he necessarily vacated it. He attracted"
28059,THOMAS TICKELL.,"Addison's attention first by some elegant lines in praise of Rosamond,"
28060,THOMAS TICKELL.,"and then by the 'Prospect of Peace,' a poem in which Tickell, although"
28061,THOMAS TICKELL.,"called by Swift Whiggissimus, for once took the Tory side. This poem"
28062,THOMAS TICKELL.,"Addison, in spite of its politics, praised highly in the _Spectator_,"
28063,THOMAS TICKELL.,which led to a lifelong friendship between them. Tickell commenced
28064,THOMAS TICKELL.,"contributing to the _Spectator_, among other things publishing there a"
28065,THOMAS TICKELL.,"poem entitled the 'Royal Progress.' Some time after, he produced a"
28066,THOMAS TICKELL.,"translation of the first book of the Iliad, which Addison declared to be"
28067,THOMAS TICKELL.,superior to Pope's. This led the latter to imagine that it was Addison's
28068,THOMAS TICKELL.,"own, although it is now, we believe, certain, from the MS., which still"
28069,THOMAS TICKELL.,"exists, that it was a veritable production of Tickell's. When Addison"
28070,THOMAS TICKELL.,"went to Ireland, as secretary to Lord Sunderland, Tickell accompanied"
28071,THOMAS TICKELL.,"him, and was employed in public business. When Addison became Secretary"
28072,THOMAS TICKELL.,"of State, he made Tickell Under-Secretary; and when he died, he left him"
28073,THOMAS TICKELL.,"the charge of publishing his works, with an earnest recommendation to"
28074,THOMAS TICKELL.,"the care of Craggs. Tickell faithfully performed the task, prefixing to"
28075,THOMAS TICKELL.,"them an elegy on his departed friend, which is now his own chief title"
28076,THOMAS TICKELL.,"to fame. In 1725, he was made secretary to the Lords-Justices of"
28077,THOMAS TICKELL.,"Ireland, a place of great trust and honour, and which he retained till"
28078,THOMAS TICKELL.,"his death. This event happened at Bath, in the year 1740."
28079,THOMAS TICKELL.,
28080,THOMAS TICKELL.,"His genius was not strong, but elegant and refined, and appears, as we"
28081,THOMAS TICKELL.,"have just stated, to best advantage in his lines on Addison's death,"
28082,THOMAS TICKELL.,"which are warm with genuine love, tremulous with sincere sorrow, and"
28083,THOMAS TICKELL.,"shine with a sober splendour, such as Addison's own exquisite taste"
28084,THOMAS TICKELL.,would have approved.

28364,RICHARD SAVAGE.,Savage must excuse our doing more than mentioning the leading dates of
28365,RICHARD SAVAGE.,his history. He was the son of the Earl of Rivers and the Countess of
28366,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"Macclesfield, and was born in London, 1698. His mother, who had begot"
28367,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"him in adultery after having openly avowed her criminality, in order to"
28368,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"obtain a divorce from her husband, placed the boy under the care of a"
28369,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"poor woman, who brought him up as her son. His maternal grandmother,"
28370,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"Lady Mason, however, took an interest him and placed him at a grammar"
28371,RICHARD SAVAGE.,school at St Alban's. He was afterwards apprenticed to a shoemaker. On
28372,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"the death of his nurse, he found some letters which led to the discovery"
28373,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"of his real parent. He applied to her, accordingly, to be acknowledged"
28374,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"as her son; but she repulsed his every advance, and persecuted him with"
28375,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"unrelenting barbarity. He found, however, some influential friends, such"
28376,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"as Steele, Fielding, Aaron Hill, Pope, and Lord Tyrconnell. He was,"
28377,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"however, his own worst enemy, and contracted habits of the most"
28378,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"irregular description. In a tavern brawl he killed one James Sinclair,"
28379,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"and was condemned to die; but, notwithstanding his mother's interference"
28380,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"to prevent the exercise of the royal clemency, he was pardoned by the"
28381,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"queen, who afterwards gave him a pension of £50 a-year. He supported"
28382,RICHARD SAVAGE.,himself in a precarious way by writing poetical pieces. Lord Tyrconnell
28383,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"took him for a while into his house, and allowed him £200 a-year, but he"
28384,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"soon quarrelled with him, and left. When the queen died he lost his"
28385,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"pension, but his friends made it up by an annuity to the same amount. He"
28386,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"went away to reside at Swansea, but on occasion of a visit he made to"
28387,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"Bristol he was arrested for a small debt, and in the prison he sickened,"
28388,RICHARD SAVAGE.,and died on the 1st of August 1743. He was only forty-five years of age.

28586,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28587,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28588,JONATHAN SWIFT.,In contemplating the lives and works of the preceding poets in this
28589,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"third volume of 'Specimens,' we have been impressed with a sense, if not"
28590,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"of their absolute, yet of their comparative mediocrity. Beside such"
28591,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"neglected giants as Henry More, Joseph Beaumont, and Andrew Marvell, the"
28592,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Pomfrets, Sedleys, Blackmores, and Savages sink into insignificance. But"
28593,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"when we come to the name of Swift, we feel ourselves again approaching"
28594,JONATHAN SWIFT.,an Alpine region. The air of a stern mountain-summit breathes chill
28595,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"around our temples, and we feel that if we have no amiability to melt,"
28596,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"we have altitude at least to measure, and strange profound secrets of"
28597,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"nature, like the ravines of lofty hills, to explore. The men of the"
28598,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may be compared to Lebanon, or"
28599,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Snowdown, or Benlomond towering grandly over fertile valleys, on which"
28600,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"they smile--Swift to the tremendous Romsdale Horn in Norway, shedding"
28601,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"abroad, from a brow of four thousand feet high, what seems a scowl of"
28602,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"settled indignation, as if resolved not to rejoice even over the wide-"
28603,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"stretching deserts which, and nothing but which, it everlastingly"
28604,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"beholds. Mountains all of them, but what a difference between such a"
28605,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"mountain as Shakspeare, and such a mountain as Swift!"
28606,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28607,JONATHAN SWIFT.,Instead of going minutely over a path so long since trodden to mire as
28608,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"the life of Swift, let us expend a page or two in seeking to form some"
28609,JONATHAN SWIFT.,estimate of his character and genius. It is refreshing to come upon a
28610,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"new thing in the world, even though it be a strange or even a bad thing;"
28611,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and certainly, in any age and country, such a being as Swift must have"
28612,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"appeared an anomaly, not for his transcendent goodness, not for his"
28613,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"utter badness, but because the elements of good and evil were mixed in"
28614,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"him into a medley so astounding, and in proportions respectively so"
28615,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"large, yet unequal, that the analysis of the two seemed to many"
28616,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"competent only to the Great Chymist, Death, and that a sense of the"
28617,JONATHAN SWIFT.,disproportion seems to have moved the man himself to inextinguishable
28618,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"laughter,--a laughter which, radiating out of his own singular heart as"
28619,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"a centre, swept over the circumference of all beings within his reach,"
28620,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and returned crying, 'Give, give,' as if he were demanding a universal"
28621,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"sphere for the exercise of the savage scorn which dwelt within him, and"
28622,JONATHAN SWIFT.,as if he laughed not more 'consumedly' at others than he did at himself.
28623,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28624,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Ere speaking of Swift as a man, let us say something about his genius."
28625,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"That, like his character, was intensely peculiar. It was a compound of"
28626,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"infinite ingenuity, with very little poetical imagination--of gigantic"
28627,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"strength, with a propensity to incessant trifling--of passionate"
28628,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"purpose, with the clearest and coldest expression, as though a furnace"
28629,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"were fuelled with snow. A Brobdignagian by size, he was for ever toying"
28630,JONATHAN SWIFT.,with Lilliputian slings and small craft. One of the most violent of
28631,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"party men, and often fierce as a demoniac in temper, his favourite motto"
28632,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"was _Vive la bagatelle_. The creator of entire new worlds, we doubt if"
28633,JONATHAN SWIFT.,his works contain more than two or three lines of genuine poetry. He may
28634,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"be compared to one of the locusts of the Apocalypse, in that he had a"
28635,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"tail like unto a scorpion, and a sting in his tail; but his 'face is not"
28636,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"as the face of man, his hair is not as the hair of women, and on his"
28637,JONATHAN SWIFT.,head there is no crown like gold.' All Swift's creations are more or
28638,JONATHAN SWIFT.,less disgusting. Not one of them is beautiful. His Lilliputians are
28639,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"amazingly life-like, but compare them to Shakspeare's fairies, such"
28640,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"as Peaseblossom, Cobweb, and Mustardseed; his Brobdignagians are"
28641,JONATHAN SWIFT.,excrescences like enormous warts; and his Yahoos might have been spawned
28642,JONATHAN SWIFT.,in the nightmare of a drunken butcher. The same coarseness characterises
28643,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"his poems and his 'Tale of a Tub.' He might well, however, in his old"
28644,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"age, exclaim, in reference to the latter, 'Good God! what a genius I"
28645,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"had when I wrote that book!' It is the wildest, wittiest, wickedest,"
28646,JONATHAN SWIFT.,wealthiest book of its size in the English language. Thoughts and
28647,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"figures swarm in every corner of its pages, till you think of a"
28648,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"disturbed nest of angry ants, for all the figures and thoughts are black"
28649,JONATHAN SWIFT.,and bitter. One would imagine the book to have issued from a mind that
28650,JONATHAN SWIFT.,had been gathering gall as well as sense in an antenatal state of being.
28651,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28652,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Swift, in all his writings--sermons, political tracts, poems, and"
28653,JONATHAN SWIFT.,fictions--is essentially a satirist. He consisted originally of three
28654,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"principal parts,--sense, an intense feeling of the ludicrous, and"
28655,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"selfish passion; and these were sure, in certain circumstances, to"
28656,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"ferment into a spirit of satire, 'strong as death, and cruel as the"
28657,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"grave.' Born with not very much natural benevolence, with little purely"
28658,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"poetic feeling, with furious passions and unbounded ambition, he was"
28659,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"entirely dependent for his peace of mind upon success. Had he become, as"
28660,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"by his talents he was entitled to be, the prime minister of his day, he"
28661,JONATHAN SWIFT.,would have figured as a greater tyrant in the cabinet than even Chatham.
28662,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"But as he was prevented from being the first statesman, he became the"
28663,JONATHAN SWIFT.,first satirist of his time. From vain efforts to grasp supremacy for
28664,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"himself and his party, he retired growling to his Dublin den; and there,"
28665,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"as Haman thought scorn to lay his hand on Mordecai, but extended his"
28666,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"murderous purpose to all the people of the Jews,--and as Nero wished"
28667,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"that Rome had one neck, that he might destroy it at a blow,--so Swift"
28668,JONATHAN SWIFT.,was stung by his personal disappointment to hurl out scorn at man and
28669,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"suspicion at his Maker. It was not, it must be noticed, the evil which"
28670,JONATHAN SWIFT.,was in man which excited his hatred and contempt; it was man himself. He
28671,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"was not merely, as many are, disgusted with the selfish and malignant"
28672,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"elements which are mingled in man's nature and character, and disposed"
28673,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"to trace them to any cause save a Divine will, but he believed man to"
28674,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"be, as a whole, the work and child of the devil; and he told the"
28675,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"imaginary creator and creature to their face, what he thought the"
28676,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"truth,--'The devil is an ass.' His was the very madness of Manichaeism."
28677,JONATHAN SWIFT.,That heresy held that the devil was one of two aboriginal creative
28678,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"powers, but Swift seemed to believe at times that he was the only God."
28679,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"From a Yahoo man, it was difficult to avoid the inference of a demon"
28680,JONATHAN SWIFT.,deity. It is very laughable to find writers in _Blackwood_ and elsewhere
28681,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"striving to prove Swift a Christian, as if, whatever were his"
28682,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"professions, and however sincere he might be often in these, the whole"
28683,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"tendency of his writings, his perpetual and unlimited abuse of man's"
28684,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"body and soul, his denial of every human virtue, the filth he pours upon"
28685,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"every phase of human nature, and the doctrine he insinuates--that man"
28686,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"has fallen indeed, but fallen, not from the angel, but from the animal,"
28687,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"or, rather, is just a bungled brute,--were not enough to shew that"
28688,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"either his notions were grossly erroneous and perverted, or that he"
28689,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"himself deserved, like another Nebuchadnezzar, to be driven from men,"
28690,JONATHAN SWIFT.,and to have a beast's heart given unto him. Sometimes he reminds us of
28691,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"an impure angel, who has surprised man naked and asleep, looked at him"
28692,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"with microscopic eyes, ignored all his peculiar marks of fallen dignity"
28693,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and incipient godhood, and in heartless rhymes reported accordingly."
28694,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28695,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Swift belonged to the same school as Pope, although the feminine element"
28696,JONATHAN SWIFT.,which was in the latter modified and mellowed his feelings. Pope was a
28697,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"more successful and a happier man than Swift. He was much smaller, too,"
28698,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"in soul as well as in body, and his gall-organ was proportionably less."
28699,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Pope's feeling to humanity was a tiny malice; Swift's became, at length,"
28700,JONATHAN SWIFT.,a black malignity. Pope always reminds us of an injured and pouting hero
28701,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"of Lilliput, 'doing well to be angry' under the gourd of a pocket-flap,"
28702,JONATHAN SWIFT.,or squealing out his griefs from the centre of an empty snuff-box; Swift
28703,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"is a man, nay, monster of misanthropy. In minute and microscopic vision"
28704,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"of human infirmities, Pope excels even Swift; but then you always"
28705,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"conceive Swift leaning down a giant, though gnarled, stature to behold"
28706,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"them, while Pope is on their level, and has only to look straight before"
28707,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"him. Pope's wrath is always measured; Swift's, as in the 'Legion-Club'"
28708,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"is a whirlwind of 'black fire and horror,' in the breath of which no"
28709,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"flesh can live, and against which genius and virtue themselves furnish"
28710,JONATHAN SWIFT.,no shield.
28711,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28712,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"After all, Swift might, perhaps, have put in the plea of Byron--"
28713,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28714,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"'All my faults perchance thou knowest,"

28717,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"There was a black spot of madness in his brain, and another black spot"
28718,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"in his heart; and the two at last met, and closed up his destiny in"
28719,JONATHAN SWIFT.,night. Let human nature forgive its most determined and systematic
28720,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"reviler, for the sake of the wretchedness in which he was involved all"
28721,JONATHAN SWIFT.,his life long. He was born (in 1667) a posthumous child; he was brought
28722,JONATHAN SWIFT.,up an object of charity; he spent much of his youth in dependence; he
28723,JONATHAN SWIFT.,had to leave his Irish college without a degree; he was flattered with
28724,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"hopes from King William and the Whigs, which were not fulfilled; he was"
28725,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"condemned to spend a great part of his life in Ireland, a country he"
28726,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"detested; he was involved--partly, no doubt, through his own blame--in"
28727,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"a succession of fruitless and miserable intrigues, alike of love and"
28728,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"politics; he was soured by want of success in England, and spoiled by"
28729,JONATHAN SWIFT.,enormous popularity in Ireland; he was tried by a kind of religious
28730,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"doubts, which would not go out to prayer or fasting; he was haunted by"
28731,JONATHAN SWIFT.,the fear of the dreadful calamity which at last befell him; his senses
28732,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and his soul left him one by one; he became first giddy, then deaf, and"
28733,JONATHAN SWIFT.,then mad; his madness was of the most terrible sort--it was a 'silent
28734,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"rage;' for a year or two he lay dumb; and at last, on the 19th of"
28735,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"October 1745,"
28736,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
28737,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"'Swift expired, a driveller and a show,'"

30356,ISAAC WATTS.,"dark tragic story of Swift, and his dubious and unhappy character, to"
30357,ISAAC WATTS.,"contemplate the useful career of a much smaller, but a much better man,"
30358,ISAAC WATTS.,Isaac Watts. This admirable person was born at Southampton on the 17th
30359,ISAAC WATTS.,"of July 1674. His father, of the same name, kept a boarding-school for"
30360,ISAAC WATTS.,"young gentlemen, and was a man of intelligence and piety. Isaac was the"
30361,ISAAC WATTS.,"eldest of nine children, and began early to display precocity of genius."
30362,ISAAC WATTS.,"At four he commenced to study Latin at home, and afterwards, under one"
30363,ISAAC WATTS.,"Pinhorn, a clergyman, who kept the free-school at Southampton, he"
30364,ISAAC WATTS.,"learned Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. A subscription was proposed for"
30365,ISAAC WATTS.,"sending him to one of the great universities, but he preferred casting"
30366,ISAAC WATTS.,"in his lot with the Dissenters. He repaired accordingly, in 1690, to"
30367,ISAAC WATTS.,"an academy kept by the Rev. Thomas Rowe, whose son, we believe, became"
30368,ISAAC WATTS.,"the husband of the celebrated Elizabeth Rowe, the once popular author"
30369,ISAAC WATTS.,of 'Letters from the Dead to the Living.' The Rowes belonged to the
30370,ISAAC WATTS.,"Independent body. At this academy Watts began to write poetry, chiefly"
30371,ISAAC WATTS.,"in the Latin language, and in the then popular Pindaric measure. At the"
30372,ISAAC WATTS.,"age of twenty, he returned to his father's house, and spent two quiet"
30373,ISAAC WATTS.,"years in devotion, meditation, and study. He became next a tutor in the"
30374,ISAAC WATTS.,family of Sir John Hartopp for five years. He was afterwards chosen
30375,ISAAC WATTS.,"assistant to Dr Chauncey, and, after the Doctor's death, became his"
30376,ISAAC WATTS.,"successor. His health, however, failed, and, after getting an assistant"
30377,ISAAC WATTS.,"for a while, he was compelled to resign. In 1712, Sir Thomas Abney, a"
30378,ISAAC WATTS.,"benevolent gentleman of the neighbourhood, received Watts into his"
30379,ISAAC WATTS.,"house, where he continued during the rest of his life--all his wants"
30380,ISAAC WATTS.,"attended to, and his feeble frame so tenderly cared for that he lived"
30381,ISAAC WATTS.,to the age of seventy-five. Sir Thomas died eight years after Dr Watts
30382,ISAAC WATTS.,"entered his establishment, but the widow and daughters continued"
30383,ISAAC WATTS.,unwearied in their attentions. Abney House was a mansion surrounded by
30384,ISAAC WATTS.,"fine gardens and pleasure-grounds, where the Doctor became thoroughly"
30385,ISAAC WATTS.,"at home, and was wont to refresh his body and mind in the intervals"
30386,ISAAC WATTS.,"of study. He preached regularly to a congregation, and in the pulpit,"
30387,ISAAC WATTS.,"although his stature was low, not exceeding five feet, the excellence"
30388,ISAAC WATTS.,"of his matter, the easy flow of his language, and the propriety of his"
30389,ISAAC WATTS.,"pronunciation, rendered him very popular. In private he was exceedingly"
30390,ISAAC WATTS.,"kind to the poor and to children, giving to the former a third part"
30391,ISAAC WATTS.,"of his small income of £100 a-year, and writing for the other his"
30392,ISAAC WATTS.,"inimitable hymns. Besides these, he published a well-known treatise"
30393,ISAAC WATTS.,"on Logic, another on 'The Improvement of the Mind,' besides various"
30394,ISAAC WATTS.,"theological productions, amongst which his 'World to Come' has been"
30395,ISAAC WATTS.,"preeminently popular. In 1728, he received from Edinburgh and Aberdeen"
30396,ISAAC WATTS.,"an unsolicited diploma of Doctor of Divinity. As age advanced, he found"
30397,ISAAC WATTS.,"himself unable to discharge his ministerial duties, and offered to remit"
30398,ISAAC WATTS.,"his salary, but his congregation refused to accept his demission. On the"
30399,ISAAC WATTS.,"25th November 1748, quite worn out, but without suffering, this able and"
30400,ISAAC WATTS.,worthy man expired.
30401,ISAAC WATTS.,
30402,ISAAC WATTS.,"If to be eminently useful is to fulfil the highest purpose of humanity,"
30403,ISAAC WATTS.,it was certainly fulfilled by Isaac Watts. His logical and other
30404,ISAAC WATTS.,"treatises have served to brace the intellects, methodise the studies,"
30405,ISAAC WATTS.,and concentrate the activities of thousands--we had nearly said of
30406,ISAAC WATTS.,"millions of minds. This has given him an enviable distinction, but he"
30407,ISAAC WATTS.,shone still more in that other province he so felicitously chose and
30408,ISAAC WATTS.,so successfully occupied--that of the hearts of the young. One of his
30409,ISAAC WATTS.,detractors called him 'Mother Watts.' He might have taken up this
30410,ISAAC WATTS.,"epithet, and bound it as a crown unto him. We have heard of a pious"
30411,ISAAC WATTS.,"foreigner, possessed of imperfect English, who, in an agony of"
30412,ISAAC WATTS.,"supplication to God for some sick friend, said, 'O Fader, hear me!"
30413,ISAAC WATTS.,"O Mudder, hear me!' It struck us as one of the finest of stories, and"
30414,ISAAC WATTS.,containing one of the most beautiful tributes to the Deity we ever
30415,ISAAC WATTS.,"heard, recognising in Him a pity which not even a father, which only"
30416,ISAAC WATTS.,a mother can feel. Like a tender mother does good Watts bend over the
30417,ISAAC WATTS.,"little children, and secure that their first words of song shall be"
30418,ISAAC WATTS.,"those of simple, heartfelt trust in God, and of faith in their Elder"
30419,ISAAC WATTS.,"Brother. To create a little heaven in the nursery by hymns, and these"
30420,ISAAC WATTS.,"not mawkish or twaddling, but beautifully natural and exquisitely simple"
30421,ISAAC WATTS.,"breathings of piety and praise, was the high task to which Watts"
30422,ISAAC WATTS.,"consecrated, and by which he has immortalised, his genius."

30757,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
30758,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"William Hamilton, of Bangour, was born in Ayrshire in 1704. He was of"
30759,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"an ancient family, and mingled from the first in the most fashionable"
30760,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,circles. Ere he was twenty he wrote verses in Ramsay's 'Tea-Table
30761,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"Miscellany.' In 1745, to the surprise of many, he joined the standard"
30762,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"of Prince Charles, and wrote a poem on the battle of Gladsmuir, or"
30763,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"Prestonpans. When the reverse of his party came, after many wanderings"
30764,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"and hair's-breadth escapes in the Highlands, he found refuge in France."
30765,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"As he was a general favourite, and as much allowance was made for his"
30766,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"poetical temperament, a pardon was soon procured for him by his friends,"
30767,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"and he returned to his native country. His health, however, originally"
30768,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"delicate, had suffered by his Highland privations, and he was compelled"
30769,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"to seek the milder clime of Lyons, where he died in 1754."
30770,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
30771,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"Hamilton was what is called a ladies'-man, but his attachments were not"
30772,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"deep, and he rather flirted than loved. A Scotch lady, who was annoyed"
30773,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"at his addresses, asked John Home how she could get rid of them. He,"
30774,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"knowing Hamilton well, advised her to appear to favour him. She acted on"
30775,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"the advice, and he immediately withdrew his suit. And yet his best poem"
30776,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"is a tale of love, and a tale, too, told with great simplicity and"
30777,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"pathos. We refer to his 'Braes of Yarrow,' the beauty of which we never"
30778,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"felt fully till we saw some time ago that lovely region, with its 'dowie"
30779,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"dens,'--its clear living stream,--Newark Castle, with its woods and"
30780,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"memories,--and the green wildernesses of silent hills which stretch on"
30781,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"all sides around; saw it, too, in that aspect of which Wordsworth sung"
30782,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,in the words--
30783,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
30784,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,'The grace of forest charms decayed
30785,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,And pastoral melancholy.'
30786,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
30787,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,It is the highest praise we can bestow upon Hamilton's ballad that it
30788,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"ranks in merit near Wordsworth's fine trinity of poems, 'Yarrow"

30948,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
30949,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
30950,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Crawford Muir, in Lanarkshire, was the birthplace of this true poet. His"
30951,ALLAN RAMSAY.,father was manager of the Earl of Hopetoun's lead-mines. Allan was born
30952,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"in 1686. His mother was Alice Bower, the daughter of an Englishman who"
30953,ALLAN RAMSAY.,had emigrated from Derbyshire. His father died while his son was yet in
30954,ALLAN RAMSAY.,infancy; his mother married again in the same district; and young Allan
30955,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"was educated at the parish school of Leadhills. At the age of fifteen,"
30956,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"he was sent to Edinburgh, and bound apprentice to a wig-maker there."
30957,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"This trade, however, he left after finishing his term. He displayed"
30958,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"rather early a passion for literature, and made a little reputation by"
30959,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"some pieces of verse,--such as 'An Address to the Easy Club,' a convivial"
30960,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"society with which he was connected,--and a considerable time after by"
30961,ALLAN RAMSAY.,a capital continuation of King James' 'Christis Kirk on the Green.'
30962,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"In 1712, he married a writer's daughter, Christiana Ross, who was his"
30963,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"affectionate companion for thirty years. Soon after, he set up a"
30964,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"bookseller's shop opposite Niddry's Wynd, and in this capacity edited"
30965,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"and published two collections,--the one of songs, some of them his own,"
30966,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"entitled 'The Tea-Table Miscellany,' and the other of early Scottish"
30967,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"poems, entitled 'The Evergreen.' In 1725, he published 'The Gentle"
30968,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Shepherd.' It was the expansion of one or two pastoral scenes which he
30969,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"ad shewn to his delighted friends. The poem became instantly popular,"
30970,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"and was republished in London and Dublin, and widely circulated in the"
30971,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"colonies. Pope admired it. Gay, then in Scotland with his patrons the"
30972,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Queensberry family, used to lounge into Ramsay's shop to get explanations"
30973,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"of its Scotch phrases to transmit to Twickenham, and to watch from the"
30974,ALLAN RAMSAY.,window the notable characters whom Allan pointed out to him in the
30975,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Edinburgh Exchange. He now removed to a better shop, and set up for his"
30976,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"sign the heads of Ben Jonson and Drummond, who agreed better in figure"
30977,ALLAN RAMSAY.,than they had done in reality at Hawthornden. He established the first
30978,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"circulating library in Scotland. His shop became a centre of intelligence,"
30979,ALLAN RAMSAY.,and Ramsay sat a Triton among the minnows of that rather mediocre day
30980,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"--giving his little senate laws, and inditing verses, songs, and fables."
30981,ALLAN RAMSAY.,At forty-five--an age when Sir Walter Scott had scarcely commenced his
30982,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Waverley novels, and Dryden had by far his greatest works to produce"
30983,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"--honest Allan imagined his vein exhausted, and ceased to write, although"
30984,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"he lived and enjoyed life for nearly thirty years more. At last, after"
30985,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"having lost money and gained obloquy, in a vain attempt to found the"
30986,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"first theatre in Edinburgh, and after building for himself a curious"
30987,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"octagon-shaped house on the north side of the Castle Hill, which, while"
30988,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"he called it Ramsay Lodge, his enemies nicknamed 'The Goose-pie,' and"
30989,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"which, though altered, still, we believe, stands, under the name of"
30990,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Ramsay Garden, the author of 'The Gentle Shepherd' breathed his last on"
30991,ALLAN RAMSAY.,the 7th of January 1758. He died of a scurvy in the gums. His son became
30992,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"a distinguished painter, intimate with Johnson, Burke, and the rest of"
30993,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"that splendid set, although now chiefly remembered from his connexion"
30994,ALLAN RAMSAY.,with them and with his father.
30995,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
30996,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Allan Ramsay was a poet with very few of the usual poetical faults. He
30997,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"had an eye for nature, but he had also an eye for the main chance. He"
30998,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"'kept his shop, and his shop kept him.' He might sing of intrigues, and"
30999,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"revels, and houses of indifferent reputation; but he was himself a"
31000,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"quiet, _canny_, domestic man, seen regularly at kirk and market. He had"
31001,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"a great reverence for the gentry, with whom he fancied himself, and"
31002,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"perhaps was, through the Dalhousie family, connected. He had a vast"
31003,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"opinion of himself; and between pride of blood, pride of genius, and"
31004,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"plenty of means, he was tolerably happy. How different from poor maudlin"
31005,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Fergusson, or from that dark-browed, dark-eyed, impetuous being who was,"
31006,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"within a year of Ramsay's death, to appear upon the banks of Doon,"
31007,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"coming into the world to sing divinely, to act insanely, and prematurely"
31008,ALLAN RAMSAY.,to die!
31009,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
31010,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"A bard, in the highest use of the word, in which it approaches the"
31011,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"meaning of prophet, Ramsay was not, else he would not have ceased so"
31012,ALLAN RAMSAY.,soon to sing. Whatever lyrical impulse was in him speedily wore itself
31013,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"out, and left him to his milder mission as a broad reflector of Scottish"
31014,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"life--in its humbler, gentler, and better aspects. His 'Gentle Shepherd'"
31015,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"is a chapter of Scottish still-life; and, since the pastoral is"
31016,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"essentially the poetry of peace, the 'Gentle Shepherd' is the finest"
31017,ALLAN RAMSAY.,pastoral in the world. No thunders roll among these solitary crags; no
31018,ALLAN RAMSAY.,lightnings affright these lasses among their _claes_ at Habbie's Howe;
31019,ALLAN RAMSAY.,the air is still and soft; the plaintive bleating of the sheep upon the
31020,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"hills, the echoes of the city are distant and faintly heard, so that the"
31021,ALLAN RAMSAY.,very sounds seem in unison and in league with silence. One thinks of
31022,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Shelley's isle 'mid the Aegean deep:--
31023,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
31024,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"'It is an isle under Ionian skies,"
31025,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Beautiful as the wreck of Paradise;
31026,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"And for the harbours are not safe and good,"
31027,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"The land would have remained a solitude,"
31028,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"But for some pastoral people, native there,"
31029,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Who from the Elysian clear and sunny air
31030,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,"
31031,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Simple and generous, innocent and bold."
31032,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
31033,ALLAN RAMSAY.,*       *       *       *       *
31034,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
31035,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"The winged storms, chanting their thunder psalm"
31036,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm"
31037,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,"
31038,ALLAN RAMSAY.,From whence the fields and woods ever renew
31039,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Their green and golden immortality.'
31040,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
31041,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Yet in the little circle of calm carved out by the magician of 'The
31042,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Gentle Shepherd' there is no insipidity. Lust is sternly excluded, but"
31043,ALLAN RAMSAY.,love of the purest and warmest kind there breathes. The parade of
31044,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"learning is not there; but strong common sense thinks, and robust and"
31045,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"manly eloquence declaims. Humour too is there, and many have laughed at"
31046,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Mause and Baldy, whom all the frigid wit of 'Love for Love' and the"
31047,ALLAN RAMSAY.,'School for Scandal' could only move to contempt or pity. A _dénouement_
31048,ALLAN RAMSAY.,of great skill is not wanting to stir the calm surface of the story by
31049,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"the wind of surprise; the curtain falls over a group of innocent,"
31050,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"guileless, and happy hearts, and as we gaze at them we breathe the"
31051,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"prayer, that Scotland's peerage and Scotland's peasantry may always thus"
31052,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"be blended into one bond of mutual esteem, endearment, and excellence."
31053,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Well might Campbell say--'Like the poetry of Tasso and Ariosto, that of"
31054,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"the ""Gentle Shepherd"" is engraven on the memory of its native country."
31055,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Its verses have passed into proverbs, and it continues to be the delight"
31056,ALLAN RAMSAY.,and solace of the peasantry whom it describes.'
31057,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
31058,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Ramsay has very slightly touched on the religion of his countrymen. This
31059,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"is to be regretted; but if he had no sympathy with that, he, at least,"
31060,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"disdained to counterfeit it, and its poetical aspects have since been"
31061,ALLAN RAMSAY.,adequately sung by other minstrels.

31693,ROBERT LLOYD.,Robert Lloyd was born in London in 1733. He was the son of one of the
31694,ROBERT LLOYD.,"under-masters of Westminster School. He went to Cambridge, where he"
31695,ROBERT LLOYD.,became distinguished for his talents and notorious for his dissipation.
31696,ROBERT LLOYD.,"He became an usher under his father, but soon tired of the drudgery, and"
31697,ROBERT LLOYD.,"commenced professional author. He published a poem called 'The Actor,'"
31698,ROBERT LLOYD.,"which attracted attention, and was the precursor of 'The Rosciad.' He"
31699,ROBERT LLOYD.,"wrote for periodicals, produced some theatrical pieces of no great"
31700,ROBERT LLOYD.,"merit, and edited the _St James' Magazine_. This failed, and Lloyd,"
31701,ROBERT LLOYD.,"involved in pecuniary distresses, was cast into the Fleet. Here he was"
31702,ROBERT LLOYD.,"deserted by all his boon companions except Churchill, to whose sister he"
31703,ROBERT LLOYD.,"was attached, and who allowed him a guinea a-week and a servant, besides"
31704,ROBERT LLOYD.,promoting a subscription for his benefit. When the news of Churchill's
31705,ROBERT LLOYD.,"death arrived, Lloyd was seated at dinner; he became instantly sick,"

31834,DAVID MALLETT.,
31835,DAVID MALLETT.,"David Mallett was the son of a small innkeeper in Crieff, Perthshire,"
31836,DAVID MALLETT.,"where he was born in the year 1700. Crieff, as many of our readers know,"
31837,DAVID MALLETT.,"is situated on the western side of a hill, and commands a most varied and"
31838,DAVID MALLETT.,"beautiful prospect, including Drummond Castle, with its solemn shadowy"
31839,DAVID MALLETT.,"woods, and the Ochils, on the south,--Ochtertyre, one of the loveliest"
31840,DAVID MALLETT.,"spots in Scotland, and the gorge of Glenturrett, on the north,--and the"
31841,DAVID MALLETT.,"bold dark hills which surround the romantic village of Comrie, on the"
31842,DAVID MALLETT.,"west. Crieff is now a place of considerable note, and forms a centre"
31843,DAVID MALLETT.,of summer attraction to multitudes; but at the commencement of the
31844,DAVID MALLETT.,eighteenth century it must have been a miserable hamlet. _Malloch_ was
31845,DAVID MALLETT.,"originally the name of the poet, and the name is still common in that"
31846,DAVID MALLETT.,"part of Perthshire. David attended the college of Aberdeen, and became,"
31847,DAVID MALLETT.,"afterwards, an unsalaried tutor in the family of Mr Home of Dreghorn,"
31848,DAVID MALLETT.,"near Edinburgh. We find him next in the Duke of Montrose's family, with"
31849,DAVID MALLETT.,"a salary of £30 per annum. In 1723, he accompanied his pupils to London,"
31850,DAVID MALLETT.,"and changed his name to Mallett, as more euphonious. Next year, he"
31851,DAVID MALLETT.,"produced his pretty ballad of 'William and Margaret,' and published it"
31852,DAVID MALLETT.,in Aaron Hill's 'Plain Dealer.' This served as an introduction to the
31853,DAVID MALLETT.,"literary society of the metropolis, including such names as Young and"
31854,DAVID MALLETT.,"Pope. In 1733, he disgraced himself by a satire on the greatest man then"
31855,DAVID MALLETT.,"living, the venerable Richard Bentley. Mallett was one of those mean"
31856,DAVID MALLETT.,"creatures who always worship a rising, and turn their backs on a setting"
31857,DAVID MALLETT.,"sun. By his very considerable talents, his management, and his address,"
31858,DAVID MALLETT.,he soon rose in the world. He was appointed under-secretary to the Prince
31859,DAVID MALLETT.,"of Wales, with a salary of £200 a-year. In conjunction with Thomson, to"
31860,DAVID MALLETT.,"whom he was really kind, he wrote in 1740, 'The Masque of Alfred,' in"
31861,DAVID MALLETT.,"honour of the birthday of the Princess Augusta. His first wife, of whom"
31862,DAVID MALLETT.,"nothing is recorded, having died, he married the daughter of Lord"
31863,DAVID MALLETT.,"Carlisle's steward, who brought him a fortune of £10,000. Both she and"
31864,DAVID MALLETT.,Mallett himself gave themselves out as Deists. This was partly owing to
31865,DAVID MALLETT.,"his intimacy with Bolingbroke, to gratify whom, he heaped abuse upon Pope"
31866,DAVID MALLETT.,"in a preface to 'The Patriot-King,' and was rewarded by Bolingbroke"
31867,DAVID MALLETT.,leaving him the whole of his works and MSS. These he afterwards
31868,DAVID MALLETT.,"published, and exposed himself to the vengeful sarcasm of Johnson, who"
31869,DAVID MALLETT.,"said that Bolingbroke was a scoundrel and a coward;--a scoundrel, to"
31870,DAVID MALLETT.,"charge a blunderbuss against Christianity; and a coward, because he durst"
31871,DAVID MALLETT.,"not fire it himself, but left a shilling to a beggarly Scotsman to draw"
31872,DAVID MALLETT.,the trigger after his death. Mallett ranked himself among the
31873,DAVID MALLETT.,"calumniators and, as it proved, murderers of Admiral Byng. He wrote a"
31874,DAVID MALLETT.,"Life of Lord Bacon, in which, it was said, he forgot that Bacon was a"
31875,DAVID MALLETT.,"philosopher, and would probably, when he came to write the Life of"
31876,DAVID MALLETT.,"Marlborough, forget that he was a general. This Life of Bacon is now"
31877,DAVID MALLETT.,"utterly forgotten. We happened to read it in our early days, and thought"
31878,DAVID MALLETT.,it a very contemptible performance. The Duchess of Marlborough left £1000
31879,DAVID MALLETT.,in her will between Glover and Mallett to write a Life of her husband.
31880,DAVID MALLETT.,"Glover threw up his share of the work, and Mallett engaged to perform the"
31881,DAVID MALLETT.,"whole, to which, besides, he was stimulated by a pension from the second"
31882,DAVID MALLETT.,"Duke of Marlborough. He got the money, but when he died it was found that"
31883,DAVID MALLETT.,he had not written a line of the work. In his latter days he held the
31884,DAVID MALLETT.,lucrative office of Keeper of the Book of Entries for the port of London.
31885,DAVID MALLETT.,He died on the 2lst April 1765.
31886,DAVID MALLETT.,
31887,DAVID MALLETT.,"Mallett is, on the whole, no credit to Scotland. He was a bad, mean,"
31888,DAVID MALLETT.,"insincere, and unprincipled man, whose success was procured by despicable"
31889,DAVID MALLETT.,"and dastardly arts. He had doubtless some genius, and his 'Birks of"
31890,DAVID MALLETT.,"Invermay,' and 'William and Margaret,' shall preserve his name after his"
31891,DAVID MALLETT.,"clumsy imitation of Thomson, called 'The Excursion,' and his long,"
31892,DAVID MALLETT.,rambling 'Amyntor and Theodora;' have been forgotten.

32109,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32110,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"This writer possessed some true imagination, although his claim to"
32111,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,immortality lies in the narrow compass of one poem--his 'Ode to
32112,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Solitude.' Little is known of his personal history. He was born in 1721
32113,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"--belonging to a gentleman's family in Cumberland. He studied medicine,"
32114,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and was for some time a surgeon connected with the army. When the peace
32115,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"came, he established himself in London as a medical practitioner. In"
32116,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"1755, he published his 'Solitude,' which found many admirers, including"
32117,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Dr Johnson, who pronounced its opening lines 'very noble.' He afterwards"
32118,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"indited several other pieces, wrote a translation of Tibullus, and"
32119,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"became one of the critical staff of the _Monthly Review_. He was unable,"
32120,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"however, through all these labours to secure a competence, and, in 1759,"
32121,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,he sought the West Indies. In St Christopher's he commenced practising
32122,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"as a physician, and married the Governor's daughter, who brought him a"
32123,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,fortune. He wrote a poem entitled 'The Sugar-cane.' This was sent over
32124,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"to London in MS., and was read at Sir Joshua Reynold's table to a"
32125,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"literary coterie, who, according to Boswell, all burst out into a laugh"
32126,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"when, after much blank-verse pomp, the poet began a new paragraph thus--"
32127,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32128,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Now, Muse, let's sing of _rats_!"
32129,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32130,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"And what increased the ridicule was, that one of the company, slily"
32131,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"overlooking the reader, found that the word had been originally 'mice,'"
32132,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,but had been changed to rats as more dignified.
32133,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32134,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Boswell goes on to record Johnson's opinion of Grainger. He said, 'He"
32135,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"was an agreeable man, a man that would do any good that was in his"
32136,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"power.' His translation of Tibullus was very well done, but 'The Sugar-"
32137,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"cane, a Poem,' did not please him. 'What could he make of a Sugar-cane?"
32138,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"one might as well write ""The Parsley-bed, a Poem,"" or ""The Cabbage"
32139,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Garden, a Poem.""' Boswell--'You must then _pickle_ your cabbage with the"
32140,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,_sal Atticum_.' Johnson--'One could say a great deal about cabbage. The
32141,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,poem might begin with the advantages of civilised society over a rude
32142,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"state, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no cabbages till Oliver"
32143,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Cromwell's soldiers introduced them, and one might thus shew how arts"
32144,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"are propagated by conquest, as they were by the Roman arms.' Cabbage, by"
32145,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"the way, in a metaphorical sense, might furnish a very good subject for"
32146,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,a literary _satire_.
32147,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32148,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Grainger died of the fever of the country in 1767. Bishop Percy
32149,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"corroborates Johnson's character of him as a man. He says, 'He was not"
32150,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"only a man of genius and learning, but had many excellent virtues, being"
32151,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"one of the most generous, friendly, benevolent men I ever knew.'"
32152,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32153,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Grainger in some points reminds us of Dyer. Dyer staked his reputation
32154,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"on 'The Fleece;' but it is his lesser poem, 'Grongar Hill,' which"
32155,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,preserves his name; that fine effusion has survived the laboured work.
32156,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,And so Grainger's 'Solitude' has supplanted the stately 'Sugar-cane.'
32157,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,The scenery of the West Indies had to wait till its real poet appeared
32158,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,in the author of 'Paul and Virginia.' Grainger was hardly able to cope
32159,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"with the strange and gorgeous contrasts it presents of cliffs and crags,"
32160,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"like those of Iceland, with vegetation rich as that of the fairest parts"
32161,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"of India, and of splendid sunshine, with tempests of such tremendous"
32162,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"fury that, but for their brief continuance, no property could be secure,"
32163,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and no life could be safe.
32164,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32165,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"The commencement of the 'Ode to Solitude' is fine, but the closing part"
32166,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,becomes tedious. In the middle of the poem there is a tumult of
32167,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"personifications, some of them felicitous and others forced."
32168,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
32169,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Sage Reflection, bent with years,'"
32170,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"may pass, but"
32171,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Conscious Virtue, void of fears,'"
32172,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is poor.
32173,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Halcyon Peace on moss reclined,'"
32174,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is a picture;
32175,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Retrospect that scans the mind,'"
32176,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is nothing;
32177,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Health that snuffs the morning air,'"
32178,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is a living image; but what sense is there in
32179,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Full-eyed Truth, with bosom bare?'"
32180,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and how poor his
32181,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Laughter in loud peals that breaks,'"
32182,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,to Milton's
32183,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Laughter, holding both his sides!'"
32184,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"The paragraph, however, commencing"
32185,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'With you roses brighter bloom,'"
32186,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and closing with
32187,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'The bournless macrocosm's thine,'"
32188,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"is very spirited, and, along with the opening lines, proves"
32189,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Grainger a poet.

32322,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32323,MICHAEL BRUCE.,We refer our readers to Dr Mackelvie's well-known and very able Life of
32324,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"poor Bruce, for his full story, and for the evidence on which his claim"
32325,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"to the 'Cuckoo' is rested. Apart from external evidence, we think that"
32326,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"poem more characteristic of Bruce's genius than of Logan's, and have"
32327,MICHAEL BRUCE.,therefore ranked it under Bruce's name.
32328,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32329,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Bruce was born on the 27th of March 1746, at Kinnesswood, parish of"
32330,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Portmoak, county of Kinross. His father was a weaver, and Michael was"
32331,MICHAEL BRUCE.,the fifth of a family of eight children.
32332,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32333,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Poor as his parents were, they were intelligent, religious, and most"
32334,MICHAEL BRUCE.,conscientious in the discharge of their duties to their children. In the
32335,MICHAEL BRUCE.,summer months Michael was sent out to herd cattle; and one loves to
32336,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"imagine the young poet wrapt in his plaid, under a whin-bush, while the"
32337,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"storm was blowing,--or gazing at the rainbow from the summit of a"
32338,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"fence,--or admiring at Lochleven and its old ruined castle,--or weaving"
32339,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"around the form of some little maiden, herding in a neighbouring field"
32340,MICHAEL BRUCE.,--some 'Jeanie Morrison'--one of those webs of romantic early love which
32341,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"are beautiful and evanescent as the gossamer, but how exquisitely"
32342,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"relished while they last! Say not, with one of his biographers, that his"
32343,MICHAEL BRUCE.,'education was retarded by this employment;' he was receiving in these
32344,MICHAEL BRUCE.,solitary fields a kind of education which no school and no college could
32345,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"furnish; nay, who knows but, as he saw the cuckoo winging her way from"
32346,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"one deep woodland recess to another, or heard her dull, divine monotone"
32347,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"coming from the heart of the forest, the germ of that exquisite strain,"
32348,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'least in the kingdom' of the heaven of poetry in size, but immortal in"
32349,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"its smallness, was sown in his mind? In winter he went to school, and"
32350,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"profited there so much, that at fifteen (not a very early period, after"
32351,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"all, for a Scotch student beginning his curriculum--in our day twelve"
32352,MICHAEL BRUCE.,was not an uncommon age) he was judged fit for going to college. And
32353,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"just in time a windfall came across the path of our poet, the mention of"
32354,MICHAEL BRUCE.,which may make many of our readers smile. This was a legacy which was
32355,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"left his father by a relative, amounting to 200 merks, or £11, 2s.6d."
32356,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"With this munificent sum in his pocket, Bruce was sent to study at"
32357,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Edinburgh College. Here he became distinguished by his attainments, and"
32358,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"particularly his taste and poetic powers; and here, too, he became"
32359,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"acquainted with John Logan, afterwards his biographer. After spending"
32360,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"three sessions at college, supported by his parents and other friends,"
32361,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"he returned to the country, and taught a school at Gairney Bridge (a"
32362,MICHAEL BRUCE.,place famous for the first meeting of the first presbytery of the
32363,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Seceders) for £11 of salary. Thence he removed to Foresthill, near"
32364,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Alloa, where a damp school-room, poverty, and hard labour in teaching,"
32365,MICHAEL BRUCE.,united to injure his health and depress his spirits. At Foresthill he
32366,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"wrote his poem 'Lochleven,' which discovers no small descriptive power."
32367,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Consumption began now to make its appearance, and he returned to the"
32368,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"cottage of his parents, where he wrote his 'Elegy on Spring,' in which"
32369,MICHAEL BRUCE.,he refers with dignified pathos to his approaching dissolution. On the
32370,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"5th of July 1767, this remarkable youth died, aged twenty-one years and"
32371,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"three months. His Bible was found on his pillow, marked at the words,"
32372,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Jer. xxii. 10, 'Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep"
32373,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his"
32374,MICHAEL BRUCE.,native country.'
32375,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32376,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Lord Craig wrote some time afterwards an affecting paper in the _Mirror_,"
32377,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"recording the fate, and commending the genius of Bruce. John Logan, in"
32378,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"1770, published his poems. In the year 1807, the kind-hearted Principal"
32379,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Baird published an edition of the poems for the behoof of Bruce's mother,"
32380,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"then an aged widow. And in 1837, Dr William Mackelvie, Balgedie, Kinross-"
32381,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"shire, published what may be considered the standard Life of this poet,"
32382,MICHAEL BRUCE.,along with a complete edition of his Works.
32383,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32384,MICHAEL BRUCE.,It is impossible from so small a segment of a circle as Bruce's life
32385,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"describes, to infer with any certainty the whole. So far as we can judge"
32386,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"from the fragments left, his power was rather in the beautiful, than in"
32387,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"the sublime or in the strong. The lines on Spring, from the words 'Now"
32388,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"spring returns' to the close, form a continuous stream of pensive"
32389,MICHAEL BRUCE.,loveliness. How sweetly he sings in the shadow of death! Nor let us too
32390,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"severely blame his allusion to the old Pagan mythology, in the words--"
32391,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32392,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'I hear the helpless wail, the shriek of woe,"
32393,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"I see the muddy wave, the dreary shore;'"
32394,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32395,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"remembering that he was still a mere student, and not recovered from"
32396,MICHAEL BRUCE.,that fine intoxication in which classical literature drenches a young
32397,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"imaginative soul, and that at last we find him 'resting in the hopes of"
32398,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"an eternal day.' 'Lochleven' is the spent echo of the 'Seasons,' although,"
32399,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"as we said before, its descriptions possess considerable merit. His 'Last"
32400,MICHAEL BRUCE.,Day' is more ambitious than successful. If we grant the 'Cuckoo' to be
32401,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"his, as we are inclined decidedly to do, it is a sure title to fame,"
32402,MICHAEL BRUCE.,being one of the sweetest little poems in any language. Shakspeare would
32403,MICHAEL BRUCE.,have been proud of the verse--
32404,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32405,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'Sweet bird! thy bower is ever green,"
32406,MICHAEL BRUCE.,Thy sky is ever clear;
32407,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,"
32408,MICHAEL BRUCE.,No winter in thy year.'
32409,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32410,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Bruce has not, however, it has always appeared to us, caught so well as"
32411,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Wordsworth the differentia of the cuckoo,--its invisible, shadowy,"
32412,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"shifting, supernatural character--heard, but seldom seen--its note so"
32413,MICHAEL BRUCE.,limited and almost unearthly:--
32414,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32415,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'O Cuckoo, shall I call thee bird,"
32416,MICHAEL BRUCE.,Or but a _wandering voice_?'
32417,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
32418,MICHAEL BRUCE.,How fine this conception of a separated voice--'The viewless spirit of a
32419,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"_lonely_ sound,' plaining in the woods as if seeking for some incarnation"
32420,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"it cannot find, and saddening the spring groves by a note so contradictory"
32421,MICHAEL BRUCE.,to the genius of the season. In reference to the note of the cuckoo we
32422,MICHAEL BRUCE.,find the following remarks among the fragments from the commonplace-book
32423,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"of Dr Thomas Brown, printed by Dr Welsh:--'The name of the cuckoo has"
32424,MICHAEL BRUCE.,generally been considered as a very pure instance of imitative harmony.
32425,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"But in giving that name, we have most unjustly defrauded the poor bird of"
32426,MICHAEL BRUCE.,a portion of its very small variety of sound. The second syllable is not
32427,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"a mere echo of the first; it is the sound reversed, like the reading of"
32428,MICHAEL BRUCE.,a sotadic line; and to preserve the strictness of the imitation we should
32429,MICHAEL BRUCE.,give it the name of Ook-koo.' _This_ is the prose of the cuckoo after its
32430,MICHAEL BRUCE.,poetry.

32593,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32594,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,We hear of 'Single-speech Hamilton.' We have now to say something of
32595,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'Single-poem Smart,' the author of one of the grandest bursts of"
32596,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,devotional and poetical feeling in the English language--the 'Song to
32597,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"David.' This poor unfortunate was born at Shipbourne, Kent, in 1722."
32598,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"His father was steward to Lord Barnard, who, after his death, continued"
32599,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"his patronage to the son, who was then eleven years of age. The Duchess"
32600,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of Cleveland, through Lord Barnard's influence, bestowed on Christopher"
32601,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"an allowance of £40 a-year. With this he went to Pembroke Hall, Cam-"
32602,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"bridge, in 1739; was in 1745 elected a Fellow of Pembroke, and in 1747"
32603,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"took his degree of M.A. At college, Smart began to display that reckless"
32604,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,dissipation which led afterwards to such melancholy consequences. He
32605,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"studied hard, however, at intervals; wrote poetry both in Latin and"
32606,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"English; produced a comedy called a 'Trip to Cambridge; or, The Grateful"
32607,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Fair,' which was acted in the hall of Pembroke College; and, in spite of"
32608,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"his vices and follies, was popular on account of his agreeable manners"
32609,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"and amiable dispositions. Having become acquainted with Newberry,"
32610,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the benevolent, red-nosed bookseller commemorated in 'The Vicar of"
32611,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Wakefield,'--for whom he wrote some trifles,--he married his step-"
32612,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"daughter, Miss Carnan, in the year 1753. He now removed to London, and"
32613,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"became an author to trade. He wrote a clever satire, entitled 'The"
32614,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Hilliad,' against Sir John Hill, who had attacked him in an underhand"
32615,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"manner. He translated the fables of Phaedrus into verse,--Horace into"
32616,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"prose ('Smart's Horace' used to be a great favourite, under the rose,"
32617,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,with schoolboys); made an indifferent version of the Psalms and
32618,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Paraphrases, and a good one, at a former period, of Pope's 'Ode on St"
32619,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Cecilia's Day,' with which that poet professed himself highly pleased."
32620,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,He was employed on a monthly publication called _The Universal Visitor_.
32621,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,We find Johnson giving the following account of this matter in Boswell's
32622,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Life:--'Old Gardner, the bookseller, employed Rolt and Smart to write a"
32623,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,monthly miscellany called _The Universal Visitor_.' There was a formal
32624,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"written contract. They were bound to write nothing else,--they were to"
32625,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"have, I think, a third of the profits of the sixpenny pamphlet, and the"
32626,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,contract was for ninety-nine years. I wrote for some months in _The
32627,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Universal Visitor_ for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing"
32628,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the terms on which he was engaged to write, and thinking I was doing him"
32629,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"good. I hoped his wits would soon return to him. Mine returned to me, and"
32630,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,I wrote in _The Universal Visitor_ no longer.'
32631,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32632,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,Smart at last was called to pay the penalty of his blended labour and
32633,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,dissipation. In 1763 he was shut up in a madhouse. His derangement had
32634,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,exhibited itself in a religious way: he insisted upon people kneeling
32635,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"down along with him in the street and praying. During his confinement,"
32636,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"writing materials were denied him, and he used to write his poetical"
32637,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"pieces with a key on the wainscot. Thus, 'scrabbling,' like his own hero,"
32638,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"on the wall, he produced his immortal 'Song to David.' He became by and"
32639,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"by sane; but, returning to his old habits, got into debt, and died in the"
32640,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"King's Bench prison, after a short illness, in 1770."
32641,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32642,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,The 'Song to David' has been well called one of the greatest curiosities
32643,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of literature. It ranks in this point with the tragedies written by Lee,"
32644,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,and the sermons and prayers uttered by Hall in a similar melancholy state
32645,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of mind. In these cases, as well as in Smart's, the thin partition"
32646,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"between genius and madness was broken down in thunder,--the thunder of a"
32647,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,higher poetry than perhaps they were capable of even conceiving in their
32648,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"saner moments. Lee produced in that state--which was, indeed, nearly his"
32649,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"normal one--some glorious extravagancies. Hall's sermons, monologised"
32650,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"and overheard in the madhouse, are said to have transcended all that he"
32651,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"preached in his healthier moods. And, assuredly, the other poems by Smart"
32652,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,scarcely furnish a point of comparison with the towering and sustained
32653,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,loftiness of some parts of the 'Song to David.' Nor is it loftiness
32654,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"alone,--although the last three stanzas are absolute inspiration, and"
32655,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,you see the waters of Castalia tossed by a heavenly wind to the very
32656,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"summit of Parnassus,--but there are innumerable exquisite beauties and"
32657,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"subtleties, dropt as if by the hand of rich haste, in every corner of"
32658,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the poem. Witness his description of David's muse, as a"
32659,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32660,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'Blest light, still gaining on the gloom,"
32661,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"The more _than Michal of his bloom_,"

32680,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,And wisdom hides her skill.'
32681,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32682,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"And, not to multiply instances to repletion, this stanza about gems--"
32683,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32684,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'Of gems--their virtue and their price,"
32685,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Which, hid in earth from man's device,"
32686,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,Their _darts of lustre sheath_;
32687,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"The jasper of the master's stamp,"
32688,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"The topaz blazing like a lamp,"
32689,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,Among the mines beneath.'
32690,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
32691,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,Incoherence and extravagance we find here and there; but it is not the
32692,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"flutter of weakness, it is the fury of power: from the very stumble of"
32693,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the rushing steed, sparks are kindled. And, even as Baretti, when he"
32694,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"read the _Rambler_, in Italy, thought within himself, If such are the"
32695,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"lighter productions of the English mind, what must be the grander and"
32696,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"sterner efforts of its genius? and formed, consequently, a strong desire"
32697,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"to visit that country; so might he have reasoned, If such poems as"
32698,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'David' issue from England's very madhouses, what must be the writings"
32699,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of its saner and nobler poetic souls? and thus might he, from the"
32700,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"parallax of a Smart, have been able to rise toward the ideal altitudes"
32701,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of a Shakspeare or a Milton. Indeed, there are portions of the 'Song to"
32702,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"David,' which a Milton or a Shakspeare has never surpassed. The blaze of"
32703,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,the meteor often eclipses the light of
32704,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,

33317,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33318,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33319,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,The history of this 'marvellous boy' is familiar to all the readers of
33320,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"English poetry, and requires only a cursory treatment here. Thomas"
33321,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Chatterton was born in Bristol, November 20, 1752. His father, a teacher"
33322,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in the free-school there, had died before his birth, and he was sent to"
33323,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,be educated at a charity-school. He first learned to read from a black-
33324,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"letter Bible. At the age of fourteen, he was put apprentice to an"
33325,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"attorney; a situation which, however uncongenial, left him ample leisure"
33326,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"for pursuing his private studies. In an unlucky hour, some evil genius"
33327,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"seemed to have whispered to this extra-ordinary youth,--'Do not find or"
33328,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"force, but forge thy way to renown; the other paths to the summit of the"
33329,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"hill are worn and common-place; try a new and dangerous course, the"
33330,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"rather as I forewarn thee that thy time is short.' When, accordingly,"
33331,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"the new bridge at Bristol was finished in October 1768, Chatterton sent"
33332,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"to a newspaper a fictitious account of the opening of the old bridge,"
33333,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,alleging in a note that he had found the principal part of the
33334,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,description in an ancient MS. And having thus fairly begun to work the
33335,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"mint of forgery, it was amazing what a number of false coins he threw"
33336,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"off, and with what perfect ease and mastery! Ancient poems, pretending"
33337,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,to have been written four hundred and fifty years before; fragments of
33338,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"sermons on the Holy Spirit, dated from the fifteenth century; accounts"
33339,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,of all the churches of Bristol as they had appeared three hundred years
33340,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,before; with drawings and descriptions of the castle--most of them
33341,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"professing to be drawn from the writings of 'ane gode prieste, Thomas"
33342,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Rowley'--issued in thick succession from this wonderful, and, to use"
33343,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"the Shakspearean word in a twofold sense, 'forgetive' brain. He next"
33344,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"ventured to send to Horace Walpole, who was employed on a History of"
33345,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"British Painters, an account of eminent 'Carvellers and Peyneters,' who,"
33346,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"according to him, once flourished in Bristol. These labours he plied in"
33347,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"secret, and with the utmost enthusiasm. He used to write by the light of"
33348,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"the moon, deeming that there was a special inspiration in the rays of"
33349,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"that planet, and reminding one of poor Nat Lee inditing his insane"
33350,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,tragedies in his asylum under the same weird lustre. On Sabbaths he was
33351,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"wont to stroll away into the country around Bristol, which is very"
33352,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"beautiful, and to draw sketches of those objects which impressed his"
33353,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,imagination. He often lay down on the meadows near St Mary's Redcliffe
33354,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Church, admiring the ancient edifice; and some years ago we saw a"
33355,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"chamber near the summit of that edifice where he used to sit and write,"
33356,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"his 'eye in a fine frenzy rolling,' and where we could imagine him, when"
33357,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"a moonless night fell, composing his wild Runic lays by the light of a"
33358,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,candle burning in a human skull. It was actually in one of the rooms of
33359,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"this church that some ancient chests had been deposited, including one"
33360,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"called the 'Coffre of Mr Canynge,' an eminent merchant in Bristol, who"
33361,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,had rebuilt the church in the reign of Edward IV. This coffer had been
33362,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"broken up by public authority in 1727, and some valuable deeds had been"
33363,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"taken out. Besides these, they contained various MSS., some of which"
33364,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Chatterton's father, whose uncle was sexton of the church, had carried"
33365,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,off and used as covers to the copy-books of his scholars. This furnished
33366,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,a hint to Chatterton's inventive genius. He gave out that among these
33367,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"parchments he had found many productions of Mr Canynge's, and of the"
33368,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"aforesaid Thomas Rowley's, a priest of the fifteenth century, and a"
33369,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,friend of Canynge's. Chatterton had become a contributor to a periodical
33370,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"of the day called _The Town and Country Magazine_, and to it from time"
33371,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,to time he sent these poems. A keen controversy arose as to their
33372,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"genuineness. Horace Walpole shewed some of them, which Chatterton had"
33373,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"sent him, to Gray and Mason, who were deemed, justly, first-rate"
33374,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"authorities on antiquarian matters, and who at once pronounced them"
33375,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"forgeries. It is deeply to be regretted that these men, perceiving, as"
33376,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"they must have done, the great merit of these productions, had not made"
33377,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"more particular inquiries about them, and tried to help and save the"
33378,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"poet. Walpole, to say the least of it, treated him coldly, telling him,"
33379,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"when he had discovered the forgery, to attend to his own business, and"
33380,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"keeping some of his MSS. in his hands, till an indignant letter from the"
33381,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,author compelled him to restore them.
33382,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33383,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,Chatterton now determined to go to London. His three years' apprenticeship
33384,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"had expired, and there was in Bristol no further field for his aspiring"
33385,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"genius. He found instant employment among the booksellers, and procured"
33386,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"an introduction to Beckford, the patriot mayor, who tried to get him"
33387,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,engaged upon the Opposition side in politics. Our capricious and
33388,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"unprincipled poet, however, declared that he was a poor author that could"
33389,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,not write on both sides; and although his leanings were to the popular
33390,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"party, yet on the death of Beckford he addressed a letter to Lord North"
33391,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in support of his administration. He had projected some large works, such"
33392,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"as a History of England and a History of London, and wrote flaming"
33393,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"letters to his mother and sisters about his prospects, enclosing them at"
33394,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,the same time small remittances of money. But his bright hopes were soon
33395,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"overcast. Instead of a prominent political character, he found himself a"
33396,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,mere bookseller's hack. To this his poverty no more than his will would
33397,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"consent, for though that was great it was equalled by his pride. His life"
33398,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in the country had been regular, although his religious principles were"
33399,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"loose; but in town, misery drove him to intemperance, and intemperance,"
33400,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in its reaction, to remorse and a desperate tampering with the thought,"
33401,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33402,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,'There is one remedy for all.'
33403,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33404,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"At last, after a vain attempt to obtain an appointment as a surgeon's"
33405,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"mate to Africa, he made up his mind to suicide. A guinea had been sent"
33406,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"him by a gentleman, which he declined. Mrs Angel, his landlady, knowing"
33407,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"him to be in want, the day before his death offered him his dinner, but"
33408,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"this also he spurned; and, on the 25th of August 1770, having first"
33409,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"destroyed all his papers, he swallowed arsenic, and was found dead in"
33410,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,his bed.
33411,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33412,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,He was buried in a shell in the burial-place of Shoe-Lane Workhouse.
33413,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,He was aged seventeen years nine months and a few days. Alas for
33414,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33415,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,'The sleepless soul that perished in his pride!'
33416,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
33417,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Chatterton, had he lived, would, perhaps, have become a powerful poet,"
33418,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,or a powerful character of some kind. But we must now view him chiefly
33419,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,as a prodigy. Some have treated his power as unnatural--resembling a
33420,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"huge hydrocephalic head, the magnitude of which implies disease,"
33421,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"ultimate weakness, and early death. Others maintain that, apart from the"
33422,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"extraordinary elements that undoubtedly characterised Chatterton, and"
33423,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"constituted him a premature and prodigious birth intellectually, there"
33424,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,was also in parts of his poems evidence of a healthy vigour which only
33425,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,needed favourable circumstances to develop into transcendent excellence.
33426,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Hazlitt, holding with the one of these opinions, cries, 'If Chatterton"
33427,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"had had a great work to do by living, he would have lived!' Others"
33428,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"retort on the critic, 'On the same principle, why did Keats, whom you"
33429,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"rate so high, perish so early?' The question altogether is nugatory,"
33430,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,seeing it can never be settled. Suffice it that these songs and rhymes
33431,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"of Chatterton have great beauties, apart from the age and position of"
33432,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"their author. There may at times be madness, but there is method in it."
33433,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"The flight of the rhapsody is ever upheld by the strength of the wing,"
33434,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"and while the reading discovered is enormous for a boy, the depth of"
33435,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"feeling exhibited is equally extraordinary; and the clear, firm judgment"
33436,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"which did not characterise his conduct, forms the root and the trunk of"
33437,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,much of his poetry. It was said of his eyes that it seemed as if fire
33438,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"rolled under them; and it rolls still, and shall ever roll, below many"
33439,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,of his verses.

33711,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles he heard the horses' feet
33712,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,A-prancing on the ground:
33713,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33714,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,55 And just before the officers
33715,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"His loving wife came in,"
33716,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Weeping unfeigned tears of woe,"
33717,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,With loud and dismal din.

33724,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,57 'Sweet Florence! why those briny tears?

33729,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,58 ''Tis but a journey I shall go

33733,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,

33743,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33744,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,61 And now the officers came in
33745,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"To bring Sir Charles away,"
33746,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Who turned to his loving wife,"
33747,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And thus to her did say:
33748,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33749,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"62 'I go to life, and not to death;"
33750,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Trust thou in God above,"
33751,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And teach thy sons to fear the Lord,"
33752,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And in their hearts him love:
33753,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33754,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,63 'Teach them to run the noble race

33757,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Ye officers, lead on.'"
33758,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33759,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"64 Then Florence raved as any mad,"
33760,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And did her tresses tear;--
33761,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"'Oh, stay, my husband, lord, and life!'--"
33762,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles then dropped a tear;--
33763,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33764,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"65 Till tired out with raving loud,"
33765,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,She fell upon the floor:
33766,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Sir Charles exerted all his might,"
33767,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And marched from out the door.
33768,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33769,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"66 Upon a sledge he mounted then,"
33770,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,With looks full brave and sweet;
33771,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Looks that did show no more concern
33772,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Than any in the street.
33773,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33774,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"67 Before him went the council-men,"
33775,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"In scarlet robes and gold,"
33776,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And tassels spangling in the sun,"
33777,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Much glorious to behold:
33778,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33779,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,68 The friars of St Augustine next
33780,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Appeared to the sight,"
33781,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,All clad in homely russet weeds
33782,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Of godly monkish plight:
33783,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33784,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,69 In different parts a godly psalm
33785,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Most sweetly they did chaunt;
33786,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Behind their backs six minstrels came,"
33787,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Who tuned the strong bataunt.
33788,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33789,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,70 Then five-and-twenty archers came;
33790,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Each one the bow did bend,"
33791,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,From rescue of King Henry's friends
33792,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles for to defend.
33793,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33794,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"71 Bold as a lion came Sir Charles,"
33795,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Drawn on a cloth-laid sled
33796,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"By two black steeds, in trappings white,"
33797,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,With plumes upon their head.
33798,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33799,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,72 Behind him five-and-twenty more
33800,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Of archers strong and stout,"
33801,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"With bended bow each one in hand,"
33802,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Marched in goodly rout:
33803,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33804,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"73 Saint James's friars marched next,"
33805,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Each one his part did chaunt;
33806,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Behind their backs six minstrels came
33807,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Who tuned the strong bataunt:
33808,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33809,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"74 Then came the mayor and aldermen,"
33810,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,In cloth of scarlet decked;
33811,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And their attending men, each one"
33812,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Like eastern princes tricked:
33813,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33814,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,75 And after them a multitude
33815,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Of citizens did throng;
33816,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The windows were all full of heads,"
33817,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,As he did pass along.
33818,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33819,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"76 And when he came to the high cross,"
33820,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Sir Charles did turn and say,--"
33821,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"'O Thou that savest man from sin,"
33822,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Wash my soul clean this day!'
33823,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33824,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,77 At the great minster window sat
33825,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The king in mickle state,"
33826,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,To see Charles Bawdin go along
33827,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,To his most welcome fate.
33828,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33829,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,78 Soon as the sledge drew nigh enough
33830,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"That Edward he might hear,"
33831,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The brave Sir Charles he did stand up,"
33832,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And thus his words declare:
33833,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33834,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"79 'Thou seest me, Edward! traitor vile!"
33835,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Exposed to infamy;
33836,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"But be assured, disloyal man!"
33837,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,I'm greater now than thee.
33838,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33839,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"80 'By foul proceedings, murder, blood,"
33840,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Thou wearest now a crown;
33841,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And hast appointed me to die,"
33842,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,By power not thine own.
33843,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33844,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,81 'Thou thinkest I shall die to-day;
33845,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"I have been dead till now,"
33846,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And soon shall live to wear a crown
33847,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,For ever on my brow:
33848,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33849,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"82 'Whilst thou, perhaps, for some few years"
33850,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Shall rule this fickle land,"
33851,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,To let them know how wide the rule
33852,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,'Twixt king and tyrant hand:
33853,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33854,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"83 'Thy power unjust, thou traitor slave!"
33855,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Shall fall on thy own head'----
33856,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,From out of hearing of the king
33857,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Departed then the sled.
33858,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33859,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"84 King Edward's soul rushed to his face,"
33860,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"He turned his head away,"
33861,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And to his brother Gloucester
33862,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,He thus did speak and say:
33863,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33864,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,85 'To him that so much dreaded death
33865,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"No ghastly terrors bring,"
33866,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Behold the man! he spake the truth,"
33867,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,He's greater than a king!'
33868,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33869,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,86 'So let him die!' Duke Richard said;
33870,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,'And may each of our foes
33871,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Bend down their necks to bloody axe,"
33872,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And feed the carrion crows!'
33873,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33874,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,87 And now the horses gently drew
33875,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles up the high hill;
33876,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The axe did glisten in the sun,"
33877,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,His precious blood to spill.
33878,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
33879,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"88 Sir Charles did up the scaffold go,"
33880,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,As up a gilded car
33881,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Of victory, by valorous chiefs,"
33882,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Gained in the bloody war:
33883,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,

34239,TRANSLATED FROM THE SAXON.,"Centwin of the vale arose, he seized the massy spear; terrible was his"

34397,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Dr Johnson said once of Chesterfield, 'I thought him a lord among wits,"
34398,LORD LYTTELTON.,but I find him to be only a wit among lords.' And so we may say of Lord
34399,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lyttelton, 'He is a poet among lords, if not a lord among poets.' He was"
34400,LORD LYTTELTON.,"the son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, of Hagley in Worcestershire, and was"
34401,LORD LYTTELTON.,"born in 1709. He went to Eton and Oxford, where he distinguished himself."
34402,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Having gone the usual grand tour, he entered Parliament, and became an"
34403,LORD LYTTELTON.,opponent of Sir Robert Walpole. He was made secretary to the Prince of
34404,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Wales, and was in this capacity useful to Mallett and Thomson. In 1741,"
34405,LORD LYTTELTON.,"he married Lucy Fortescue, of Devonshire, who died five years afterwards."
34406,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lyttelton grieved sincerely for her, and wrote his affecting 'Monody' on"
34407,LORD LYTTELTON.,"the subject. When his party triumphed, he was created a Lord of the"
34408,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Treasury, and afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a peerage. He"
34409,LORD LYTTELTON.,"employed much of his leisure in literary composition, writing a good"
34410,LORD LYTTELTON.,"little book on the Conversion of St Paul, a laboured History of Henry II.,"
34411,LORD LYTTELTON.,"and some verses, including the stanza in the 'Castle of Indolence'"
34412,LORD LYTTELTON.,describing Thomson--

34414,LORD LYTTELTON.,"'A bard there dwelt, more fat than bard beseems,' &c.--"
34415,LORD LYTTELTON.,
34416,LORD LYTTELTON.,"and a very spirited prologue to Thomson's 'Coriolanus,' which was written"
34417,LORD LYTTELTON.,"after that author's death, and says of him,"
34418,LORD LYTTELTON.,
34419,LORD LYTTELTON.,--'His chaste muse employed her heaven-taught lyre
34420,LORD LYTTELTON.,None but the noblest passions to inspire:

34422,LORD LYTTELTON.,"_One line which, dying he could wish to blot_.'"
34423,LORD LYTTELTON.,
34424,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lyttelton himself died August 22, 1773, aged sixty-four. His History is"
34425,LORD LYTTELTON.,"now little read. It took him, it is said, thirty years to write it, and"
34426,LORD LYTTELTON.,he employed another man to point it--a fact recalling what is told of
34427,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Macaulay, that he sent the first volume of his 'History of England' to"
34428,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lord Jeffrey, who overlooked the punctuation and criticised the style."
34429,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Of a series of Dialogues issued by this writer, Dr Johnson remarked,"
34430,LORD LYTTELTON.,"with his usual pointed severity, 'Here is a man telling the world what"
34431,LORD LYTTELTON.,the world had all his life been telling him.' His 'Monody' expresses
34432,LORD LYTTELTON.,"real grief in an artificial style, but has some stanzas as natural in"
34433,LORD LYTTELTON.,the expression as they are pathetic in the feeling.

34543,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,
34544,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,We know very little of the history of this pleasing poet. He was born in
34545,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"1729, the son of a wine-cooper in Dublin. At the age of seventeen he"
34546,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"wrote a farce; entitled 'Love in a Mist,' and shortly after came to"
34547,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,Britain as an actor. He was for a long time a performer in Digges'
34548,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"company in Edinburgh, and subsequently resided in Newcastle-upon-Tyne."
34549,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"Here he seems to have fallen into distressed circumstances, and was"
34550,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"supported by a benevolent printer, at whose house he died in 1773. His"
34551,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,poetry is distinguished by a charming simplicity. This characterises
34552,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"'Kate of Aberdeen,' given below, and also his 'Content: a Pastoral,' in"
34553,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,which he says allegorically--
34554,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,
34555,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"'Her air was so modest, her aspect so meek,"
34556,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,So simple yet sweet were her charms!
34557,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"I kissed the ripe roses that glowed on her cheek,"
34558,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,And locked the dear maid in my arms.
34559,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,
34560,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"'Now jocund together we tend a few sheep,"
34561,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"And if, by yon prattler, the stream,"
34562,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,"Reclined on her bosom, I sink into sleep,"
34563,JOHN CUNNINGHAM.,Her image still softens my dream.'

34608,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
34609,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
34610,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,This unfortunate Scottish bard was born in Edinburgh on the 17th (some
34611,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"say the 5th) of October 1751. His father, who had been an accountant to"
34612,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"the British Linen Company's Bank, died early, leaving a widow and four"
34613,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,children. Robert spent six years at the grammar schools of Edinburgh and
34614,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Dundee, went for a short period to Edinburgh College, and then, having"
34615,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"obtained a bursary, to St Andrews, where he continued till his seven-"
34616,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,teenth year. He was at first designed for the ministry of the Scottish
34617,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Church. He distinguished himself at college for his mathematical
34618,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"knowledge, and became a favourite of Dr Wilkie, Professor of Natural"
34619,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Philosophy, on whose death he wrote an elegy. He early discovered a"
34620,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"passion for poetry, and collected materials for a tragedy on the subject"
34621,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"of Sir William Wallace, which he never finished. He once thought of"
34622,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"studying medicine, but had neither patience nor funds for the needful"
34623,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"preliminary studies. He went away to reside with a rich uncle, named"
34624,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"John Forbes, in the north, near Aberdeen. This person, however, and poor"
34625,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Fergusson unfortunately quarrelled; and, after residing some months in"
34626,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his house, he left it in disgust, and with a few shillings in his pocket"
34627,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"proceeded southwards. He travelled on foot, and such was the effect of"
34628,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his vexation and fatigue, that when he reached his mother's house he fell"
34629,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,into a severe fit of illness.
34630,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
34631,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"He became, on his recovery, a copying-clerk in a solicitor's, and"
34632,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"afterwards in a sheriff-clerk's office, and began to contribute to"
34633,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,_Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine_. We remember in boyhood reading some odd
34634,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"volumes of this production, the general matter in which was inconceivably"
34635,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"poor, relieved only by Fergusson's racy little Scottish poems. His"
34636,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"evenings were spent chiefly in the tavern, amidst the gay and dissipated"
34637,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"youth of the metropolis, to whom he was the 'wit, songster, and mimic.'"
34638,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"That his convivial powers were extraordinary, is proved by the fact of"
34639,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"one of his contemporaries, who survived to be a correspondent of Burns,"
34640,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,doubting if even he equalled the fascination of Fergusson's converse.
34641,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Dissipation gradually stole in upon him, in spite of resolutions dictated"
34642,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"by remorse. In 1773, he collected his poems into a volume, which was"
34643,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"warmly received, but brought him, it is believed, little pecuniary"
34644,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"benefit. At last, under the pressure of poverty, toil, and intemperance,"
34645,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his reason gave way, and he was by a stratagem removed to an asylum."
34646,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Here, when he found himself and became aware of his situation, he uttered"
34647,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"a dismal shriek, and cast a wild and startled look around his cell. The"
34648,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,history of his confinement was very similar to that of Nat Lee and
34649,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Christopher Smart. For instance, a story is told of him which is an exact"
34650,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,duplicate of one recorded of Lee. He was writing by the light of the
34651,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"moon, when a thin cloud crossed its disk. 'Jupiter, snuff the moon,'"
34652,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"roared the impatient poet. The cloud thickened, and entirely darkened the"
34653,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"light. 'Thou stupid god,' he exclaimed, 'thou hast snuffed it out.' By"
34654,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"and by he became calmer, and had some affecting interviews with his"
34655,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"mother and sister. A removal to his mother's house was even contemplated,"
34656,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"but his constitution was exhausted, and on the 16th of October 1774, poor"
34657,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Fergusson breathed his last. It is interesting to know that the New
34658,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Testament was his favourite companion in his cell. A little after his
34659,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"death arrived a letter from an old friend, a Mr Burnet, who had made a"
34660,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"fortune in the East Indies, wishing him to come out to India, and"
34661,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,enclosing a remittance of £100 to defray the expenses of the journey.
34662,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
34663,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Thus in his twenty-fourth year perished Robert Fergusson. He was buried
34664,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"in the Canongate churchyard, where Burns afterwards erected a monument to"
34665,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his memory, with an inscription which is familiar to most of our readers."
34666,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
34667,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Burns in one of his poems attributes to Fergusson 'glorious pairts.' He
34668,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"was certainly a youth of remarkable powers, although 'pairts' rather"
34669,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"than high genius seems to express his calibre, he can hardly be said to"
34670,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"sing, and he never soars. His best poems, such as 'The Farmer's Ingle,'"
34671,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,are just lively daguerreotypes of the life he saw around him--there is
34672,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,nothing ideal or lofty in any of them. His 'ingle-bleeze' burns low
34673,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,compared to that which in 'The Cottar's Saturday Night' springs up aloft
34674,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"to heaven, like the tongue of an altar-fire. He stuffs his poems, too,"
34675,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"with Scotch to a degree which renders them too rich for even, a Scotch-"
34676,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"man's taste, and as repulsive as a haggis to that of an Englishman. On"
34677,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"the whole, Fergusson's best claim to fame arises from the influence he"
34678,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"exerted on the far higher genius of Burns, who seems, strangely enough,"
34679,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,to have preferred him to Allan Ramsay.

35103,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"This 'learned and jovial parson,' as Campbell calls him, was born in 1721,"
35104,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"in Yorkshire. He studied at Cambridge, and became curate at Croydon, in"
35105,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"Surrey. Here he obtained the friendship of Archbishop Herring, and was by"
35106,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"him appointed vicar of Orpington in Kent, a situation which he ultimately"
35107,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"exchanged for the rectory of Hayes, in the same county. He translated"
35108,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"various minor Greek poets, including Anacreon, Sappho, Bion and Moschus,"
35109,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"Theocritus, &c. He died in 1777. His 'Brown Jug' breathes some of the"
35110,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"spirit of the first of these writers, and two or three lines of it were"
35111,FRANCIS FAWKES.,"once quoted triumphantly in Parliament by Sheil, while charging Peel, we"

35149,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"Left fatherless at four years old, his mother fulfilled her double charge"
35150,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"of duty with great tenderness and assiduity. He was educated at Appleby,"
35151,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"and subsequently became assistant at the free-school of Wakefield, took"
35152,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"deacon's orders, and gave promise, although very young, of becoming a"
35153,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"popular preacher. After various vicissitudes of life and fortune, and"
35154,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"publishing a number of works in prose and verse, Langhorne repaired to"
35155,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"London, and obtained, in 1764, the curacy and lectureship of St John's,"
35156,JOHN LANGHORNE.,Clerkenwell. He soon afterwards became assistant-preacher in Lincoln's
35157,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"Inn Chapel, where he had a very intellectual audience to address, and"
35158,JOHN LANGHORNE.,bore a somewhat trying ordeal with complete success. He continued for a
35159,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"number of years in London, maintaining his reputation both as a preacher"
35160,JOHN LANGHORNE.,and writer. His most popular works were the 'Letters of Theodosius and
35161,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"Constantia,' and a translation of Plutarch's Lives, which Wrangham"
35162,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"afterwards corrected and improved, and which is still standard. He was"
35163,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"twice married, and survived both his wives. He obtained the living of"
35164,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"Blagden in Somersetshire, and in addition to it, in 1777, a prebend in"
35165,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"the Cathedral of Wells. He died in 1779, aged only forty-four; his death,"
35166,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"it is supposed, being accelerated by intemperance, although it does not"
35167,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"seem to have been of a gross or aggravated description. Langhorne, an"
35168,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"amiable man, and highly popular as well as warmly beloved in his day,"
35169,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"survives now in memory chiefly through his Plutarch's Lives, and through"
35170,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"a few lines in his 'Country Justice,' which are immortalised by the well-"
35171,JOHN LANGHORNE.,known story of Scott's interview with Burns. Campbell puts in a plea
35172,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"besides for his 'Owen of Carron,' but the plea, being founded on early"
35173,JOHN LANGHORNE.,"reading, is partial, and has not been responded to by the public."

35544,JOHN SCOTT.,
35545,JOHN SCOTT.,
35546,JOHN SCOTT.,This poet is generally known as 'Scott of Amwell.' This arises from the
35547,JOHN SCOTT.,"fact that his father, a draper in Southwark, where John was born in"
35548,JOHN SCOTT.,"1730, retired ten years afterwards to Amwell. He had never been"
35549,JOHN SCOTT.,"inoculated with the small-pox, and such was his dread of the disease,"
35550,JOHN SCOTT.,"and that of his family, that for twenty years, although within twenty"
35551,JOHN SCOTT.,"miles of London, he never visited it. His parents, who belonged to the"
35552,JOHN SCOTT.,"amiable sect of Quakers, sent him to a day-school at Ware, but that too"
35553,JOHN SCOTT.,"he left upon the first alarm of infection. At seventeen, although his"
35554,JOHN SCOTT.,"education was much neglected, he began to relish reading, and was"
35555,JOHN SCOTT.,materially assisted in his studies by a neighbour of the name of
35556,JOHN SCOTT.,"Frogley, a master bricklayer, who, though somewhat illiterate, admired"
35557,JOHN SCOTT.,"poetry. Scott sent his first essays to the _Gentleman's Magazine_, and"
35558,JOHN SCOTT.,"in his thirtieth year published four elegies, which met with a kind"
35559,JOHN SCOTT.,"reception, although Dr Johnson said only of them, 'They are very well,"
35560,JOHN SCOTT.,but such as twenty people might write.' He produced afterwards 'The
35561,JOHN SCOTT.,"Garden,' 'Amwell,' and other poems, besides some rather narrow 'Critical"
35562,JOHN SCOTT.,"Essays on the English Poets.' When thirty-six years of age, he submitted"
35563,JOHN SCOTT.,"to inoculation, and henceforward visited London frequently, and became"
35564,JOHN SCOTT.,"acquainted with Dr Johnson, Sir William Jones, Mrs Montague, and other"
35565,JOHN SCOTT.,"eminent characters. He was a very active promoter of local improvements,"
35566,JOHN SCOTT.,and diligent in cultivating his grounds and garden. He was twice
35567,JOHN SCOTT.,"married, his first wife being a daughter of his friend Frogley. He died"
35568,JOHN SCOTT.,"in 1783, not of that disease which he so 'greatly feared,' but of a"
35569,JOHN SCOTT.,"putrid fever, at Radcliff. One note of his, entitled 'Ode on Hearing the"
35570,JOHN SCOTT.,"Drum,' still reverberates on the ear of poetic readers. Wordsworth has"
35571,JOHN SCOTT.,"imitated it in his 'Andrew Jones.' Sir Walter makes Rachel Geddes say,"
35572,JOHN SCOTT.,"in 'Redgauntlet,' alluding to books of verse, 'Some of our people do"
35573,JOHN SCOTT.,"indeed hold that every writer who is not with us is against us, but"
35574,JOHN SCOTT.,"brother Joshua is mitigated in his opinions, and correspondeth with our"
35575,JOHN SCOTT.,"friend John Scott of Amwell, who hath himself constructed verses well"
35576,JOHN SCOTT.,approved of even in the world.'

35641,ALEXANDER ROSS.,
35642,ALEXANDER ROSS.,Of this fine old Scottish poet we regret that we can tell our readers so
35643,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"little. He was born in 1698, became parish schoolmaster at Lochlee in"
35644,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"Angusshire, and published, by the advice of Dr Beattie, in 1768, a"
35645,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"volume entitled 'Helenore; or, The Fortunate Shepherdess: a Pastoral Tale"
35646,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"in the Scottish Dialect; along with a few Songs.' Some of these latter,"
35647,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"such as 'Woo'd, and Married, and a',' became very popular. Beattie loved"
35648,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"the 'good-humoured, social, happy old man,' who was 'passing rich' on"
35649,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"twenty pounds a-year, and wrote in the _Aberdeen Journal_ a poetical"
35650,ALEXANDER ROSS.,letter in the Scotch language to promote the sale of his poem. Ross died
35651,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"in 1784, about eighty-six years old, and is buried in a churchyard at the"
35652,ALEXANDER ROSS.,east end of the loch.
35653,ALEXANDER ROSS.,
35654,ALEXANDER ROSS.,Lochlee is a very solitary and romantic spot. The road to it from the
35655,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"low country, or Howe of the Mearns, conducts us through a winding,"
35656,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"unequal, but very interesting glen, which, after bearing at its foot"
35657,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"many patches of corn, yellowing amidst thick green copsewood and birch"
35658,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"trees, fades and darkens gradually into a stern, woodless, and rocky"
35659,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"defile, which emerges on a solitary loch, lying 'dern and dreary' amidst"
35660,ALEXANDER ROSS.,silent hills. It is one of those lakes which divide the distance between
35661,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"the loch and the tarn, being two miles in length and one in breadth. The"
35662,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"hills, which are stony and savage, sink directly down upon its brink."
35663,ALEXANDER ROSS.,A house or two are all the dwellings in view. The celebrated Thomas
35664,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"Guthrie dearly loves this lake, lives beside it for months at a time,"
35665,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"and is often seen rowing his lonely boat in the midst of it, by sunlight"
35666,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"and by moonlight too. On the west, one bold, sword-like summit, Craig"
35667,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"Macskeldie by name, cuts the air, and relieves the monotony of the other"
35668,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"mountains. Fit rest has Ross found in that calm, rural burying-place,"
35669,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"beside 'the rude forefathers of the hamlet,' with short, sweet, flower-"
35670,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"sprinkled grass covering his dust, the low voice of the lake sounding"
35671,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"a few yards from his cold ear, and a plain gravestone uniting with his"
35672,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"native mountains to form his memorial. 'Fortunate Shepherd,' (shall we"
35673,ALEXANDER ROSS.,call him?) to have obtained a grave so intensely characteristic of a
35674,ALEXANDER ROSS.,Scottish poet!

35764,RICHARD GLOVER.,
35765,RICHARD GLOVER.,
35766,RICHARD GLOVER.,Glover was a man so remarkable as to be thought capable of having written
35767,RICHARD GLOVER.,"the letters of Junius, although no one now almost names his name or reads"
35768,RICHARD GLOVER.,"his poetry. He was the son of a Hamburgh merchant in London, and born"
35769,RICHARD GLOVER.,"(1712) in St Martin's Lane, Cannon Street. He was educated at a private"
35770,RICHARD GLOVER.,"school in Surrey, but being designed for trade, was never sent to a"
35771,RICHARD GLOVER.,"university, yet by his own exertions he became an excellent classical"
35772,RICHARD GLOVER.,"scholar. At sixteen he wrote a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton,"
35773,RICHARD GLOVER.,and at twenty-five produced nine books of his 'Leonidas.' Partly through
35774,RICHARD GLOVER.,"its own merits, partly through its liberal political sentiments, and"
35775,RICHARD GLOVER.,"partly through the influence of Lord Cobham, to whom it was inscribed,"
35776,RICHARD GLOVER.,"and the praise of Fielding and Chatham, it became very popular. In 1739,"
35777,RICHARD GLOVER.,"he produced a poem entitled 'London; or, The Progress of Commerce,' and a"
35778,RICHARD GLOVER.,"spirited ballad entitled 'Admiral Hosier's Ghost,' which we have given,"
35779,RICHARD GLOVER.,both designed to rouse the national spirit against the Spaniards.
35780,RICHARD GLOVER.,
35781,RICHARD GLOVER.,"Glover was a merchant, and very highly esteemed among his commercial"
35782,RICHARD GLOVER.,"brethren, although at one time unfortunate in business. When forced by"
35783,RICHARD GLOVER.,"his failure to seek retirement, he produced a tragedy on the subject of"
35784,RICHARD GLOVER.,"Boadicea, which ran the usual nine nights, although it has long since"
35785,RICHARD GLOVER.,ceased to be acted or read. In his later years his affairs improved; he
35786,RICHARD GLOVER.,"returned again to public life, was elected to Parliament, and approved"
35787,RICHARD GLOVER.,"himself a painstaking and popular M.P. In 1770, he enlarged his"
35788,RICHARD GLOVER.,"'Leonidas' from nine books to twelve, and afterwards wrote a sequel to"
35789,RICHARD GLOVER.,"it, entitled 'The Athenais.' Glover spent his closing years in opulent"
35790,RICHARD GLOVER.,"retirement, enjoying the intimacy and respect of the most eminent men of"
35791,RICHARD GLOVER.,"the day, and died in 1785."
35792,RICHARD GLOVER.,
35793,RICHARD GLOVER.,"'Leonidas' may be called the epic of the eighteenth century, and betrays"
35794,RICHARD GLOVER.,the artificial genius of its age. The poet rises to his flight like a
35795,RICHARD GLOVER.,"heavy heron--not a hawk or eagle. Passages in it are good, but the effect"
35796,RICHARD GLOVER.,"of the whole is dulness. It reminds you of Cowper's 'Homer,' in which all"
35797,RICHARD GLOVER.,"is accurate, but all is cold, and where even the sound of battle lulls"
35798,RICHARD GLOVER.,"to slumber--or of Edwin Atherstone's 'Fall of Nineveh,' where you are"
35799,RICHARD GLOVER.,"fatigued with uniform pomp, and the story struggles and staggers under a"
35800,RICHARD GLOVER.,"load of words. Thomson exclaimed when he heard of the work of Glover, 'He"
35801,RICHARD GLOVER.,"write an epic, who never saw a mountain!' And there was justice in the"
35802,RICHARD GLOVER.,remark. The success of 'Leonidas' was probably one cause of the swarm of
35803,RICHARD GLOVER.,epics which appeared in the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of
35804,RICHARD GLOVER.,"the nineteenth century.--Cottle himself being, according to De Quincey,"
35805,RICHARD GLOVER.,"'the author of four epic poems, _and_ a new kind of blacking.' Their day"
35806,RICHARD GLOVER.,seems now for ever at an end.

36417,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
36418,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"This poet was born in Langholm, Dumfriesshire, in 1734. His father was"
36419,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"minister of the parish, but removed to Edinburgh, where William, after"
36420,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"attending the High School, became clerk to a brewery, and ultimately"
36421,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"a partner in the concern. In this he failed, however; and in 1764 he"
36422,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,repaired to London to prosecute literature. Lord Lyttelton became his
36423,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"patron, although he did him so little service in a secular point of"
36424,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"view, that Mickle was fain to accept the situation of corrector to the"
36425,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Clarendon Press at Oxford. Here he published his 'Pollio,' his 'Concubine,'"
36426,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"--a poem in the manner of Spenser, very sweetly and musically written,"
36427,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"which became popular,--and in 1771 the first canto of a translation of"
36428,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the 'Lusiad' of Camoens. This translation, which he completed in 1775,"
36429,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"was published by subscription, and at once increased his fortune and"
36430,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,established his fame. He had resigned his office of corrector of the
36431,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"press, and was residing with Mr Tomkins, a farmer at Foresthill, near"
36432,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Oxford. In 1779, he went out to Portugal as secretary to Commodore"
36433,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Johnstone, and, as the translator of Camoens, was received with much"
36434,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"distinction. On his return with a little money, he married Mr Tomkins'"
36435,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"daughter, who had a little more, and took up his permanent residence at"
36436,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Foresthill, where he died of a short illness in 1788."
36437,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
36438,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"His translation of the 'Lusiad' is understood to be too free and flowery,"
36439,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,and the translator stands in the relation to Camoens which Pope does to
36440,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Homer. 'Cumnor Hall' has suggested to Scott his brilliant romance of
36441,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"'Kenilworth,' and is a garland worthy of being bound up in the beautiful"
36442,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,locks of Amy Robsart for evermore. 'Are ye sure the news is true?' is a
36443,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"song true to the very soul of Scottish and of general nature, and worthy,"

36657,LORD NUGENT.,"wards made peace with the Court, and received various promotions and"
36658,LORD NUGENT.,"marks of favour besides the peerage. In 1739, he published anonymously"
36659,LORD NUGENT.,a volume of poems possessing considerable merit. He was converted from
36660,LORD NUGENT.,"Popery, and wrote some vigorous verses on the occasion. Unfortunately,"
36661,LORD NUGENT.,"however, he relapsed, and again celebrated the event in a very weak poem,"
36662,LORD NUGENT.,"entitled 'Faith.' He died in 1788. Although a man of decided talent, as"

36847,JOHN LOGAN.,JOHN LOGAN.
36848,JOHN LOGAN.,
36849,JOHN LOGAN.,
36850,JOHN LOGAN.,John Logan was born in the year 1748. He was the son of a farmer at
36851,JOHN LOGAN.,"Soutra, in the parish of Fala, Mid-Lothian. He was educated for the"
36852,JOHN LOGAN.,"church at Edinburgh, where he became intimate with Robertson, afterwards"
36853,JOHN LOGAN.,"the historian. So, at least, Campbell asserts; but he strangely calls him"
36854,JOHN LOGAN.,"a student of the same standing, whereas, in fact, Robertson saw light in"
36855,JOHN LOGAN.,"1721, and had been a settled minister five years before Logan was born."
36856,JOHN LOGAN.,"After finishing his studies, he became tutor in the family of Mr Sinclair"
36857,JOHN LOGAN.,"of Ulbster, and the late well-known Sir John Sinclair was one of his"
36858,JOHN LOGAN.,"pupils. When licensed to preach, Logan became popular, and was in his"
36859,JOHN LOGAN.,"twenty-fifth year appointed one of the ministers of South Leith. In 1781,"
36860,JOHN LOGAN.,"he read in Edinburgh a course of lectures on the Philosophy of History,"
36861,JOHN LOGAN.,"and in 1782, he printed one of them, on the Government of Asia. In the"
36862,JOHN LOGAN.,"same year he published a volume of poems, which were well received. In"
36863,JOHN LOGAN.,"1783, he wrote a tragedy called 'Runnymede,' which was, owing to some"
36864,JOHN LOGAN.,"imagined incendiary matter, prohibited from being acted on the London"
36865,JOHN LOGAN.,"boards, but which was produced on the Edinburgh stage, and afterwards"
36866,JOHN LOGAN.,"published. This, along with some alleged irregularities of conduct on the"
36867,JOHN LOGAN.,"part of Logan, tended to alienate his flock, and he was induced to retire"
36868,JOHN LOGAN.,"on a small annuity. He betook himself to London, where, in conjunction"
36869,JOHN LOGAN.,"with the Rev. Mr Thomson,--who had left the parish of Monzievaird, in"
36870,JOHN LOGAN.,"Perthshire, owing to a scandal,--he wrote for the _English Review_, and"
36871,JOHN LOGAN.,"was employed to defend Warren Hastings. This he did in an able manner,"
36872,JOHN LOGAN.,"although a well-known story describes him as listening to Sheridan, on"
36873,JOHN LOGAN.,"the Oude case, with intense interest, and exclaiming, after the first"
36874,JOHN LOGAN.,"hour, 'This is mere declamation without proof'--after the next two, 'This"
36875,JOHN LOGAN.,is a man of extraordinary powers'--and ere the close of the matchless
36876,JOHN LOGAN.,"oration, 'Of all the monsters in history, Warren Hastings is the vilest.'"
36877,JOHN LOGAN.,"Logan died in the year 1788, in his lodgings, Marlborough Street. His"
36878,JOHN LOGAN.,"sermons were published shortly after his death, and if parts of them are,"
36879,JOHN LOGAN.,"as is alleged, pilfered from a Swiss divine, (George Joachim Zollikofer,)"
36880,JOHN LOGAN.,"they have not remained exclusively with the thief, since no sermons have"
36881,JOHN LOGAN.,been so often reproduced in Scottish pulpits as the elegant orations
36882,JOHN LOGAN.,issued under the name of Logan.
36883,JOHN LOGAN.,
36884,JOHN LOGAN.,"We have already declined to enter on the controversy about 'The Cuckoo,'"
36885,JOHN LOGAN.,"intimating, however, our belief, founded partly upon Logan's unscrupulous"
36886,JOHN LOGAN.,"character and partly on internal evidence, that it was originally written"
36887,JOHN LOGAN.,"by Bruce, but probably polished to its present perfection by Logan, whose"
36888,JOHN LOGAN.,other writings give us rather the impression of a man of varied
36889,JOHN LOGAN.,"accomplishments and excellent taste, than of deep feeling or original"
36890,JOHN LOGAN.,"genius. If Logan were not the author of 'The Cuckoo,' there was a special"
36891,JOHN LOGAN.,"baseness connected with the fact, that when Burke sought him out in"
36892,JOHN LOGAN.,"Edinburgh, solely from his admiration of that poem, he owned the soft and"
36893,JOHN LOGAN.,"false impeachment, and rolled as a sweet morsel praise from the greatest"
36894,JOHN LOGAN.,"man of the age, which he knew was the rightful due of another."

37288,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.
37289,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
37290,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
37291,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,The amiable Dr Blacklock deserves praise for his character and for his
37292,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"conduct under very peculiar circumstances, much more than for his"
37293,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"poetry. He was born at Annan, where his father was a bricklayer, in"
37294,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"1721. When about six months old, he lost his eyesight by small-pox. His"
37295,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"father used to read to him, especially poetry, and through the kindness"
37296,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,of friends he acquired some knowledge of the Latin tongue. His father
37297,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"having been accidentally killed when Thomas was nineteen, it might"
37298,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"have fared hard with him, but Dr Stevenson, an eminent medical man"
37299,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"in Edinburgh, who had seen some verses composed by the blind youth,"
37300,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"took him to the capital, sent him to college to study divinity, and"
37301,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"encouraged him to write and to publish poetry. His volume, to which"
37302,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"was prefixed an account of the author, by Professor Spence of Oxford,"
37303,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"attracted much attention. Blacklock was licensed to preach in 1759, and"
37304,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"three years afterwards was married to a Miss Johnstone of Dumfries, an"
37305,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"exemplary but plain-looking lady, whose beauty her husband was wont to"
37306,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,praise so warmly that his friends were thankful that his infirmity was
37307,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"never removed, and thought how justly Cupid had been painted blind. He"
37308,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"was even, through the influence of the Earl of Selkirk, appointed to the"
37309,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"parish of Kirkcudbright, but the parishioners opposed his induction on"
37310,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"the plea of his want of sight, and, in consideration of a small annuity,"
37311,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"he withdrew his claims. He finally settled down in Edinburgh, where he"
37312,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,supported himself chiefly by keeping young gentlemen as boarders in his
37313,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,house. His chief amusements were poetry and music. His conduct to (1786)
37314,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,and correspondence with Burns are too well known to require to be
37315,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,noticed at length here. He published a paper of no small merit in the
37316,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"'Encyclopaedia Britannica' on Blindness, and is the author of a work"
37317,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"entitled 'Paraclesis; or, Consolations of Religion,'--which surely none"
37318,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,require more than the blind. He died of a nervous fever on the 7th of
37319,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"July 1791, so far fortunate that he did not live to see the ruin of his"
37320,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,immortal _protégé_.
37321,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
37322,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"Blacklock was a most amiable, genial, and benevolent being. He was"
37323,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"sometimes subject to melancholy--_un_like many of the blind, and one"
37324,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"especially, whom we name not, but who, still living, bears a striking"
37325,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"resemblance to Blacklock in fineness of mind, warmth of heart, and high-"
37326,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"toned piety, but who is cheerful as the day. As to his poetry, it is"
37327,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"undoubtedly wonderful, considering the circumstances of its production,"
37328,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"if not _per se_. Dr Johnson says to Boswell,--'As Blacklock had the"
37329,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"misfortune to be blind, we may be absolutely sure that the passages in"
37330,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,his poems descriptive of visible objects are combinations of what he
37331,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,remembered of the works of other writers who could see. That foolish
37332,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,fellow Spence has laboured to explain philosophically how Blacklock may
37333,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"have done, by his own faculties, what it is impossible he should do. The"
37334,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"solution, as I have given it, is plain. Suppose I know a man to be so"
37335,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"lame that he is absolutely incapable to move himself, and I find him in a"
37336,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"different room from that in which I left him, shall I puzzle myself with"
37337,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"idle conjectures that perhaps his nerves have, by some unknown change,"
37338,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"all at once become effective? No, sir; it is clear how he got into a"
37339,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,different room--he was CARRIED.'
37340,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
37341,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,Perhaps there is a fallacy in this somewhat dogmatic statement. Perhaps
37342,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,the blind are not so utterly dark but they may have certain dim
37343,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,_simulacra_ of external objects before their eyes and minds. Apart from
37344,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"this, however, Blacklock's poetry endures only from its connexion with"
37345,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"the author's misfortune, and from the fact that through the gloom he"
37346,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,groped greatly to find and give the burning hand of the peasant poet the
37347,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"squeeze of a kindred spirit,--kindred, we mean, in feeling and heart,"
37348,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,although very far removed in strength of intellect and genius.

37469,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"Minto, sister of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto, wrote the first and the"
37470,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"finest of the two versions. Mrs Cockburn, the author of the second, was a"
37471,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"remarkable person. Her maiden name was Alicia Rutherford, and she was the"
37472,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"daughter of Mr Rutherford of Fernilee, in Selkirkshire. She married Mr"
37473,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"Patrick Cockburn, a younger son of Adam Cockburn of Ormiston, Lord"

37476,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"on a long and serious correspondence on religious subjects, in which it"

37479,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,and saw and proclaimed the wonderful promise of Walter Scott. She wrote
37480,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"a great deal, but the 'Flowers of the Forest' is the only one of her"
37481,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"effusions that has been published. A ludicrous story is told of her son,"

37860,JAMES MACPHERSON.,
37861,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"Now we come to one who, with all his faults, was not only a real, but a"
37862,JAMES MACPHERSON.,great poet. The events of his life need not detain us long. He was born
37863,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"at Kingussie, Inverness-shire, in 1738, and educated at Aberdeen. At"
37864,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"twenty he published a very juvenile production in verse, called 'The"
37865,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"Highlandman: a Heroic Poem, in six cantos.' He taught for some time the"
37866,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"school of Ruthven, near his native place, and became afterwards tutor"
37867,JAMES MACPHERSON.,in the family of Graham of Balgowan. While attending a scion of this
37868,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"family--afterwards Lord Lynedoch--at Moffat Wells, Macpherson became"
37869,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"acquainted with Home, the author of 'Douglas,' and shewed to him some"
37870,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"fragments of Gaelic poetry, translated by himself. Home was delighted"
37871,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"with these specimens, and the consequence was, that our poet, under the"
37872,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"patronage of Home, Blair, Adam Fergusson, and Dr Carlyle, (the once"
37873,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"famous 'Jupiter Carlyle,' minister of Inveresk--called 'Jupiter' because"
37874,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"he used to sit to sculptors for their statues of 'Father Jove,' and"
37875,JAMES MACPHERSON.,declared by Sir Walter Scott to have been the 'grandest demigod he ever
37876,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"saw,') published, in a small volume of sixty pages, his 'Fragments of"
37877,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"Ancient Poetry, translated from the Gaelic or Erse language.' This"
37878,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"_brochure_ became popular, and Macpherson was provided with a purse to"
37879,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"go to the Highlands to collect additional pieces. The result was, in"
37880,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"1762, 'Fingal: an Epic Poem;' and, in the next year, 'Temora,' another"
37881,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"epic poem. Their sale was prodigious, and the effect not equalled till,"
37882,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"twenty-four years later, the poems of Burns appeared. He realised £1200"
37883,JAMES MACPHERSON.,by these productions. In 1764 he accompanied Governor Johnston to
37884,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"Pensacola as his secretary, but quarrelled with him, and returned to"
37885,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"London. Here he became a professional pamphleteer, always taking the"
37886,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"ministerial side, and diversifying these labours by publishing a"
37887,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"translation of Homer, in the style of his Ossian, which, as Coleridge"
37888,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"says of another production, was 'damned unanimously.' Our readers are"
37889,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"familiar with his row with Dr Johnson, who, when threatened with"
37890,JAMES MACPHERSON.,personal chastisement for his obstinate and fierce incredulity in the
37891,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"matter of Ossian, thus wrote the author:--"

37910,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"like Mallett before him, but with twenty times his abilities, pursued"
37911,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"his peculiar course. He was appointed agent for the Nabob of Arcot,"
37912,'SAM. JOHNSON.',and became M.P. for Carnelford. In this way he speedily accumulated a
37913,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"handsome fortune, and in 1789, while still a youngish man, he retired to"
37914,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"his native parish, where he bought the estate of Raitts, and founded a"
37915,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"splendid villa, called Belleville, where, in ease and affluence, he spent"
37916,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"his remaining days. Surviving Johnson, his ablest opponent, by twelve"
37917,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"years, he died on the 17th of February 1796, in the full view of Ossian's"
37918,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"country. One of his daughters became his heir, and another was the first"
37919,'SAM. JOHNSON.',wife of Sir David Brewster. Macpherson in his will ordered that his body
37920,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"should be buried in Westminster Abbey, and left a sum of money to erect a"
37921,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"monument to him near Belleville. He lies, accordingly, in Poets' Corner,"
37922,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"and a marble obelisk to his memory may be seen near Kingussie, in the"
37923,'SAM. JOHNSON.',centre of some trees.

37925,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"There is nothing new that is true, or true that is new, to be said about"
37926,'SAM. JOHNSON.',the questions connected with Ossian's Poems. That Macpherson is the sole
37927,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"author is a theory now as generally abandoned as the other, which held"
37928,'SAM. JOHNSON.',that he was simply a free translator of the old bard. To the real
37929,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"fragments of Ossian, which he found in the Highlands, he acted very much"
37930,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"as he did to the ancient property of Raitts, in his own native parish."
37931,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"This he purchased in its crude state, and beautified into a mountain"
37932,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"paradise. He changed, however, its name into Belleville, and it had been"
37933,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"better if he had behaved in a similar way with the poems, and published"
37934,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"them as, with some little groundwork from another, the veritable writings"
37935,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"of James Macpherson, Esq. The ablest opponent of his living reputation"
37936,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"was, as we said, Johnson; and the ablest enemy of his posthumous fame has"
37937,'SAM. JOHNSON.',been Macaulay. We are at a loss to understand _his_ animosity to the
37938,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"author of Ossian. Were the Macphersons and Macaulays ever at feud, and"
37939,'SAM. JOHNSON.',did the historian lose his great-great-grandmother in some onslaught made
37940,'SAM. JOHNSON.',on the Hebrides by the progenitors of the pseudo-Ossian? Macpherson as
37941,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"a man we respect not, and we are persuaded that the greater part of"
37942,'SAM. JOHNSON.',Ossian's Poems can be traced no further than his teeming brain. Nor are
37943,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"we careful to defend his poetry from the common charges of monotony,"
37944,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"affectation, and fustian. But we deem Macaulay grossly unjust in his"
37945,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"treatment of Macpherson's genius and its results, and can fortify our"
37946,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"judgment by that of Sir Walter Scott and Professor Wilson, two men as far"
37947,'SAM. JOHNSON.',superior to the historian in knowledge of the Highlands and of Highland
37948,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"song, and in genuine poetic taste, as they were confessedly in original"
37949,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"imagination. The former says, 'Macpherson was certainly a man of high"
37950,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"talents, and his poetic powers are honourable to his country.' Wilson, in"
37951,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"an admirable paper in _Blackwood_ for November 1839, while admitting many"
37952,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"faults in Ossian, eloquently proclaims the presence in his strains of"
37953,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"much of the purest, most pathetic, and most sublime poetry, instancing"
37954,'SAM. JOHNSON.',the 'Address to the Sun' as equal to anything in Homer or Milton. Both
37955,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"these great writers have paid Macpherson a higher compliment still,--they"
37956,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"have imitated him, and the speeches of Allan Macaulay (a far greater"
37957,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"genius than his namesake), Ranald MacEagh, and Elspeth MacTavish, in the"
37958,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"'Waverley Novels,' and such, articles by Christopher North as 'Cottages,'"
37959,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"'Hints for the Holidays,' and a 'Glance at Selby's Ornithology,' are all"
37960,'SAM. JOHNSON.',coloured by familiarity and fellow-feeling with Ossian's style. Best of
37961,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"all, the Highlanders as a nation have accepted Ossian as their bard; he"
37962,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"is as much the poet of Morven as Burns of Coila, and it is as hopeless to"
37963,'SAM. JOHNSON.',dislodge the one from the Highland as the other from the Lowland heart.
37964,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"The true way to learn to appreciate Ossian's poetry is not to hurry, as"
37965,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"Macaulay seems to have done, in a steamer from Glasgow to Oban, and"
37966,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"thence to Ballachulish, and thence through Glencoe, (mistaking a fine"
37967,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"lake for a 'sullen pool' on his way, and ignoring altogether its peculiar"
37968,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"features of grandeur,) and thence to Inverness or Edinburgh; but it is to"
37969,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"live for years--as Macpherson did while writing Ossian, and Wilson also"
37970,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"did to some extent--under the shadow of the mountains,--to wander through"

37974,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"spray of cataracts,--to plough a solitary path into the heart of forests,"
37975,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"and to sleep and dream for hours amidst their sunless glades,--to meet"
37976,'SAM. JOHNSON.',on twilight hills the apparition of the winter moon rising over snowy
37977,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"wastes,--to descend by her ghastly light precipices where the eagles"
37978,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"are sleeping,--and, returning home, to be haunted by night-visions of"
37979,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"mightier mountains, wilder desolations, and giddier descents;--experience"
37980,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"somewhat like this is necessary to form a true 'Child of the Mist,' and"
37981,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"to give the full capacity for sharing in or appreciating the shadowy,"
37982,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"solitary, pensive, and magnificent spirit which tabernacles in Ossian's"

37984,'SAM. JOHNSON.',
37985,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"Never, at least, can we forget how, in our boyhood, while feeling, but"

37987,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"shapes of mountains resting against the stars, mirrored from below in"
37988,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"lakes and wild torrents, and quaking sometimes in concert with the"
37989,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"quaking couch of the half-slumbering earthquake, the poems of Ossian"

38035,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,fox looked out from the windows; the rank grass of the wall
38036,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,waved round its head. Desolate is the dwelling of Moina;
38037,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,silence is in the house of her fathers. Raise the song of
38038,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,"mourning, O bards! over the land of strangers. They have but"
38039,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,fallen before us: for one day we must fall. Why dost thou
38040,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,"build the hall, son of the winged days? Thou lookest from"
38041,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,"thy towers to-day: yet a few years, and the blast of the"
38042,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,"desert comes; it howls in thy empty court, and whistles"
38043,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,round thy half-worn shield. And let the blast of the desert
38044,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,come! we shall be renowned in our day! The mark of my arm
38045,DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA.,shall be in battle; my name in the song of bards. Raise the

38054,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38055,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,Night came down on the sea; Roma's bay received the ship. A
38056,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,rock bends along the coast with all its echoing wood. On the
38057,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"top is the circle of Loda, the mossy stone of power! A"
38058,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"narrow plain spreads beneath, covered with grass and aged"
38059,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"trees, which the midnight winds, in their wrath, had torn"
38060,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,from the shaggy rock. The blue course of a stream is there!
38061,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistle's beard. The
38062,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,flame of three oaks arose: the feast is spread around: but
38063,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"the soul of the king is sad, for Carric-thura's chief"
38064,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,distressed.
38065,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38066,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"The wan, cold moon, rose in the east; sleep descended on the"
38067,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,youths! Their blue helmets glitter to the beam; the fading
38068,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,fire decays. But sleep did not rest on the king: he rose in
38069,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"the midst of his arms, and slowly ascended the hill, to"
38070,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,behold the flame of Sarno's tower.
38071,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38072,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"The flame was dim and distant, the moon hid her red face in"
38073,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"the east. A blast came from the mountain, on its wings was"
38074,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"the spirit of Loda. He came to his place in his terrors, and"
38075,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,shook his dusky spear. His eyes appear like flames in his
38076,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,dark face; his voice is like distant thunder. Fingal
38077,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"advanced his spear in night, and raised his voice on high."
38078,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38079,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"Son of night, retire: call thy winds, and fly! Why dost thou"
38080,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"come to my presence, with thy shadowy arms? Do I fear thy"
38081,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"gloomy form, spirit of dismal Loda? Weak is thy shield of"
38082,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"clouds: feeble is that meteor, thy sword! The blast rolls"

38085,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38086,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,Dost thou force me from my place? replied the hollow voice.
38087,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,The people bend before me. I turn the battle in the field of
38088,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"the brave. I look on the nations, and they vanish: my"
38089,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,nostrils pour the blast of death. I come abroad on the
38090,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,winds: the tempests are before my face. But my dwelling is
38091,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"calm, above the clouds; the fields of my rest are pleasant."
38092,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38093,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"Dwell in thy pleasant fields, said the king; let Comhal's"

38096,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,spirit of dismal Loda? Why then dost thou frown on me? Why
38097,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,shake thine airy spear? Thou frownest in vain: I never fled
38098,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,from the mighty in war. And shall the sons of the wind
38099,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,frighten the king of Morven? No: he knows the weakness of
38100,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,their arms!
38101,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38102,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"Fly to thy land, replied the form: receive the wind, and"
38103,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,fly! The blasts are in the hollow of my hand: the course of
38104,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"the storm is mine. The king of Sora is my son, he bends at"
38105,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,the storm of my power. His battle is around Carric-thura;
38106,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"and he will prevail! Fly to thy land, son of Comhal, or feel"
38107,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,my flaming wrath!
38108,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38109,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,He lifted high his shadowy spear! He bent forward his
38110,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"dreadful height. Fingal, advancing, drew his sword; the"
38111,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,blade of dark-brown Luno. The gleaming path of the steel
38112,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,winds through the gloomy ghost. The form fell shapeless into
38113,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"air, like a column of smoke, which the staff of the boy"
38114,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"disturbs, as it rises from the half-extinguished furnace."
38115,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,
38116,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"The spirit of Loda shrieked, as, rolled into himself, he"
38117,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"rose on the wind. Inistore shook at the sound, the waves"
38118,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,heard it on the deep. They stopped in their course with
38119,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,"fear: the friends of Fingal started at once, and took their"
38120,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,heavy spears. They missed the king; they rose in rage; all
38121,FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA.,their arms resound!

38489,JOSEPH WARTON.,
38490,JOSEPH WARTON.,
38491,JOSEPH WARTON.,This accomplished critic and poet was born in 1722. He was son to the
38492,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Vicar of Basingstoke, and brother to Thomas Warton. (See a former volume"
38493,JOSEPH WARTON.,"for his life.) Joseph was educated at Winchester College, and became"
38494,JOSEPH WARTON.,intimate there with William Collins. He wrote when quite young some
38495,JOSEPH WARTON.,poetry in the _Gentleman's Magazine_. He was in due time removed to Oriel
38496,JOSEPH WARTON.,"College, where he composed two poems, entitled 'The Enthusiast,' and 'The"
38497,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Dying Indian.' In 1744, he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Oxford,"
38498,JOSEPH WARTON.,and was ordained to his father's curacy at Basingstoke. He went thence
38499,JOSEPH WARTON.,"to Chelsea, but did not remain there long, owing to some disagreement"
38500,JOSEPH WARTON.,"with his parishioners, and returned to Basingstoke. In 1746, he published"
38501,JOSEPH WARTON.,"a volume of Odes, and in the preface expressed his hope that it might"
38502,JOSEPH WARTON.,be successful as an attempt to bring poetry back from the didactic and
38503,JOSEPH WARTON.,"satirical taste of the age, to the truer channels of fancy and description."
38504,JOSEPH WARTON.,"The motive of this attempt was, however, more praiseworthy than its success"
38505,JOSEPH WARTON.,was conspicuous.
38506,JOSEPH WARTON.,
38507,JOSEPH WARTON.,"In 1748, Warton was presented by the Duke of Bolton to the rectory of"
38508,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Winslade, and he straightway married a Miss Daman, to whom he had for"
38509,JOSEPH WARTON.,"some time been attached. In the same year he began, and in 1753 he"
38510,JOSEPH WARTON.,"finished and printed, an edition of Virgil in English and Latin. Of this"
38511,JOSEPH WARTON.,"large, elaborate work, Warton himself supplied only the life of Virgil,"
38512,JOSEPH WARTON.,"with three essays on pastoral, didactic, and epic poetry, and a poetical"
38513,JOSEPH WARTON.,"version of the Eclogues and the Georgics, more correct but less spirited"
38514,JOSEPH WARTON.,"than Dryden's. He adopted Pitt's version of the Aeneid, and his friends"
38515,JOSEPH WARTON.,"furnished some of the dissertations, notes, &c. Shortly after, he"
38516,JOSEPH WARTON.,"contributed twenty-four excellent papers, including some striking"
38517,JOSEPH WARTON.,"allegories, and some good criticisms on Shakspeare, to the _Adventurer_."
38518,JOSEPH WARTON.,"In 1754, he was appointed to the living of Tunworth, and the next year"
38519,JOSEPH WARTON.,was elected second master of Winchester School. Soon after this he
38520,JOSEPH WARTON.,"published anonymously 'An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope,'"
38521,JOSEPH WARTON.,"which, whether because he failed in convincing the public that his"
38522,JOSEPH WARTON.,"estimate of Pope was the correct one, or because he stood in awe of"
38523,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Warburton, he did not complete or reprint for twenty-six years. It is a"
38524,JOSEPH WARTON.,"somewhat gossiping book, but full of information and interest."
38525,JOSEPH WARTON.,
38526,JOSEPH WARTON.,"In May 1766, he was made head-master of Winchester. In 1768, he lost his"
38527,JOSEPH WARTON.,"wife, and next year married a Miss Nicholas of Winchester. In 1782, he"
38528,JOSEPH WARTON.,"was promoted, through Bishop Lowth, to a prebend's post in St Paul's, and"
38529,JOSEPH WARTON.,"to the living of Thorley, which he exchanged for that of Wickham. Other"
38530,JOSEPH WARTON.,"livings dropped in upon him, and in 1793 he resigned the mastership of"
38531,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Winchester, and went to reside at Wickham. Here he employed himself in"
38532,JOSEPH WARTON.,"preparing an edition of Pope, which he published in 1797. In 1800 he"
38533,JOSEPH WARTON.,died.
38534,JOSEPH WARTON.,
38535,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Warton, like his brother, did good service in resisting the literary"
38536,JOSEPH WARTON.,"despotism of Pope, and in directing the attention of the public to the"
38537,JOSEPH WARTON.,forgotten treasures of old English poetry. He was a man of extensive
38538,JOSEPH WARTON.,"learning, a very fair and candid, as well as acute critic, and his 'Ode"
38539,JOSEPH WARTON.,to Fancy' proves him to have possessed no ordinary genius.

38997,A PASTORAL.,"1  My time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,"
38998,A PASTORAL.,When Phoebe went with me wherever I went;
38999,A PASTORAL.,Ten thousand sweet pleasures I felt in my breast:
39000,A PASTORAL.,Sure never fond shepherd like Colin was blest!
39001,A PASTORAL.,"But now she is gone, and has left me behind,"
39002,A PASTORAL.,What a marvellous change on a sudden I find!
39003,A PASTORAL.,"When things were as fine as could possibly be,"
39004,A PASTORAL.,I thought 'twas the Spring; but alas! it was she.
39005,A PASTORAL.,
39006,A PASTORAL.,"2  With such a companion to tend a few sheep,"
39007,A PASTORAL.,"To rise up and play, or to lie down and sleep:"
39008,A PASTORAL.,"I was so good-humoured, so cheerful and gay,"
39009,A PASTORAL.,My heart was as light as a feather all day;
39010,A PASTORAL.,"But now I so cross and so peevish am grown,"
39011,A PASTORAL.,"So strangely uneasy, as never was known."
39012,A PASTORAL.,"My fair one is gone, and my joys are all drowned,"
39013,A PASTORAL.,And my heart--I am sure it weighs more than a pound.
39014,A PASTORAL.,
39015,A PASTORAL.,"3  The fountain that wont to run sweetly along,"
39016,A PASTORAL.,And dance to soft murmurs the pebbles among;
39017,A PASTORAL.,"Thou know'st, little Cupid, if Phoebe was there,"
39018,A PASTORAL.,"'Twas pleasure to look at, 'twas music to hear:"
39019,A PASTORAL.,"But now she is absent, I walk by its side,"
39020,A PASTORAL.,"And still, as it murmurs, do nothing but chide;"
39021,A PASTORAL.,"Must you be so cheerful, while I go in pain?"
39022,A PASTORAL.,"Peace there with your bubbling, and hear me complain."
39023,A PASTORAL.,
39024,A PASTORAL.,"4  My lambkins around me would oftentimes play,"
39025,A PASTORAL.,And Phoebe and I were as joyful as they;
39026,A PASTORAL.,"How pleasant their sporting, how happy their time,"
39027,A PASTORAL.,"When Spring, Love, and Beauty, were all in their prime!"
39028,A PASTORAL.,"But now, in their frolics when by me they pass,"
39029,A PASTORAL.,I fling at their fleeces a handful of grass:
39030,A PASTORAL.,"Be still, then, I cry, for it makes me quite mad,"
39031,A PASTORAL.,To see you so merry while I am so sad.
39032,A PASTORAL.,
39033,A PASTORAL.,5  My dog I was ever well pleased to see
39034,A PASTORAL.,Come wagging his tail to my fair one and me;
39035,A PASTORAL.,"And Phoebe was pleased too, and to my dog said,"
39036,A PASTORAL.,"'Come hither, poor fellow;' and patted his head."
39037,A PASTORAL.,"But now, when he's fawning, I with a sour look"
39038,A PASTORAL.,Cry 'Sirrah;' and give him a blow with my crook:
39039,A PASTORAL.,And I'll give him another; for why should not Tray
39040,A PASTORAL.,"Be as dull as his master, when Phoebe's away?"
39041,A PASTORAL.,
39042,A PASTORAL.,"6  When walking with Phoebe, what sights have I seen,"
39043,A PASTORAL.,"How fair was the flower, how fresh was the green!"
39044,A PASTORAL.,"What a lovely appearance the trees and the shade,"
39045,A PASTORAL.,"The corn-fields and hedges, and everything made!"
39046,A PASTORAL.,"But now she has left me, though all are still there,"
39047,A PASTORAL.,They none of them now so delightful appear:
39048,A PASTORAL.,"'Twas nought but the magic, I find, of her eyes,"
39049,A PASTORAL.,Made so many beautiful prospects arise.
39050,A PASTORAL.,
39051,A PASTORAL.,"7  Sweet music went with us both all the wood through,"
39052,A PASTORAL.,"The lark, linnet, throstle, and nightingale too;"
39053,A PASTORAL.,"Winds over us whispered, flocks by us did bleat,"
39054,A PASTORAL.,And chirp went the grasshopper under our feet.
39055,A PASTORAL.,"But now she is absent, though still they sing on,"
39056,A PASTORAL.,"The woods are but lonely, the melody's gone:"
39057,A PASTORAL.,"Her voice in the concert, as now I have found,"
39058,A PASTORAL.,Gave everything else its agreeable sound.
39059,A PASTORAL.,
39060,A PASTORAL.,"8  Rose, what is become of thy delicate hue?"
39061,A PASTORAL.,And where is the violet's beautiful blue?
39062,A PASTORAL.,Does ought of its sweetness the blossom beguile?
39063,A PASTORAL.,"That meadow, those daisies, why do they not smile?"
39064,A PASTORAL.,"Ah! rivals, I see what it was that you dressed,"
39065,A PASTORAL.,And made yourselves fine for--a place in her breast:
39066,A PASTORAL.,"You put on your colours to pleasure her eye,"
39067,A PASTORAL.,"To be plucked by her hand, on her bosom to die."
39068,A PASTORAL.,
39069,A PASTORAL.,9  How slowly Time creeps till my Phoebe return!
39070,A PASTORAL.,While amidst the soft zephyr's cool breezes I burn:
39071,A PASTORAL.,"Methinks, if I knew whereabouts he would tread,"
39072,A PASTORAL.,"I could breathe on his wings, and 'twould melt down the lead."
39073,A PASTORAL.,"Fly swifter, ye minutes, bring hither my dear,"
39074,A PASTORAL.,And rest so much longer for't when she is here.
39075,A PASTORAL.,"Ah, Colin! old Time is full of delay,"
39076,A PASTORAL.,Nor will budge one foot faster for all thou canst say.
39077,A PASTORAL.,
39078,A PASTORAL.,"10 Will no pitying power, that hears me complain,"
39079,A PASTORAL.,"Or cure my disquiet, or soften my pain?"
39080,A PASTORAL.,"To be cured, thou must, Colin, thy passion remove;"
39081,A PASTORAL.,But what swain is so silly to live without love!
39082,A PASTORAL.,"No, deity, bid the dear nymph to return,"
39083,A PASTORAL.,For ne'er was poor shepherd so sadly forlorn.
39084,A PASTORAL.,Ah! what shall I do? I shall die with despair;
39085,A PASTORAL.,"Take heed, all ye swains, how ye part with your fair."
