4873,THE LADY,
4874,THE LADY,Yesterday I thought to roam
4875,THE LADY,"Idly through the fields of home,"
4876,THE LADY,And I came at morning's end
4877,THE LADY,To our brook's familiar bend.
4878,THE LADY,"There I raised my eyes, and there,"
4879,THE LADY,"Shining through an ampler air,"
4880,THE LADY,Folded in by hills of blue
4881,THE LADY,"Such as Wessex never knew,"
4882,THE LADY,Changed as in a waking dream
4883,THE LADY,Flowed the well-remembered stream.
4884,THE LADY,
4885,THE LADY,Now a line of wattled pale
4886,THE LADY,"Fenced the downland from the vale,"
4887,THE LADY,Now the sedge was set with reeds
4888,THE LADY,"Fitter for Arcadian meads,"
4889,THE LADY,And where I was wont to find
4890,THE LADY,"Only things of timid kind,"
4891,THE LADY,Now the Genius of the pool
4892,THE LADY,Mocked me from his corner cool.
4893,THE LADY,"Eyes he had with malice quick,"
4894,THE LADY,"Tufted hair and ears a-prick,"
4895,THE LADY,"And, above a tiny chin,"
4896,THE LADY,Lips with laughter wide a-grin.

4899,THE LADY,
4900,THE LADY,Therewithal a shaggy flank
4901,THE LADY,"In the crystal clear he sank,"
4902,THE LADY,And beneath the unruffled tide
4903,THE LADY,A little pair of hooves I spied.
4904,THE LADY,
4905,THE LADY,"Yet though plainly there he stood,"
4906,THE LADY,"Creature of the wave and wood,"
4907,THE LADY,Under his satyric grace
4908,THE LADY,"Something manlike I could trace,"
4909,THE LADY,And the eyes that mocked me there
4910,THE LADY,Like a gleam of memory were.
4911,THE LADY,
4912,THE LADY,"""So,"" said I at last to him,"
4913,THE LADY,"Frowning from the river's brim,"
4914,THE LADY,"""This is where you come to play,"
4915,THE LADY,"Heedless of the time of day."""
4916,THE LADY,
4917,THE LADY,"""Nay,"" replied the youthful god,"
4918,THE LADY,"Leaning on the flowery sod,"
4919,THE LADY,"""Here there are no clocks, and so"
4920,THE LADY,"Time can neither come nor go."""
4921,THE LADY,
4922,THE LADY,"""Little goat,"" said I, ""you're late,"
4923,THE LADY,And your dinner will not wait:
4924,THE LADY,"If to-day you wish to eat,"
4925,THE LADY,"Trust me, you must find your feet."""
4926,THE LADY,
4927,THE LADY,"""Father,"" said the little goat,"
4928,THE LADY,"""Do you know that I can float?"
4929,THE LADY,
4930,THE LADY,{188}
4931,THE LADY,
4932,THE LADY,Do you know that I can dive
4933,THE LADY,As deep as any duck alive?
4934,THE LADY,Would you like to see me drop
4935,THE LADY,"Out of yonder willow's top?"""
4936,THE LADY,
4937,THE LADY,"Sternly I replied again,"
4938,THE LADY,"""You may spare your boasting vain;"
4939,THE LADY,All that you can do I did
4940,THE LADY,"When I was myself a kid."""
4941,THE LADY,Laughter followed such as pealed
4942,THE LADY,Through the first unfurrowed field.
4943,THE LADY,"""Then what mother says is true,"
4944,THE LADY,"And your hoof is cloven too!"""
4945,THE LADY,
4946,THE LADY,"Ah!--but that irreverent mirth,"
4947,THE LADY,"Learnt of the primeval earth,"
4948,THE LADY,Surely was with magic fraught
4949,THE LADY,That upon my pulses wrought:
4950,THE LADY,I too felt the air of June
4951,THE LADY,"Humming with a merry tune,"
4952,THE LADY,"I too reckoned, like a boy,"
4953,THE LADY,Less of Time and more of Joy:
4954,THE LADY,"Till, as homeward I was wending,"
4955,THE LADY,"I perceived my back unbending,"
4956,THE LADY,And before the mile was done
4957,THE LADY,Ran beside my truant son.

4965,THE LADY,
4966,THE LADY,"The Squire sat propped in a pillowed chair,"
4967,THE LADY,"His eyes were alive and clear of care,"
4968,THE LADY,But well he knew that the hour was come
4969,THE LADY,To bid good-bye to his ancient home.
4970,THE LADY,
4971,THE LADY,"He looked on garden, wood, and hill,"
4972,THE LADY,"He looked on the lake, sunny and still:"
4973,THE LADY,The last of earth that his eyes could see
4974,THE LADY,Was the island church of Orchardleigh.
4975,THE LADY,
4976,THE LADY,The last that his heart could understand
4977,THE LADY,Was the touch of the tongue that licked his hand
4978,THE LADY,"""Bury the dog at my feet,"" he said,"
4979,THE LADY,"And his voice dropped, and the Squire was dead."
4980,THE LADY,
4981,THE LADY,"Now the dog was a hound of the Danish breed,"
4982,THE LADY,Staunch to love and strong at need:
4983,THE LADY,He had dragged his master safe to shore
4984,THE LADY,When the tide was ebbing at Elsinore.
4985,THE LADY,
4986,THE LADY,"From that day forth, as reason would,"
4987,THE LADY,"He was named ""Fidele,"" and made it good:"
4988,THE LADY,When the last of the mourners left the door
4989,THE LADY,Fidele was dead on the chantry floor.
4990,THE LADY,
4991,THE LADY,{190}
4992,THE LADY,
4993,THE LADY,"They buried him there at his master's feet,"
4994,THE LADY,And all that heard of it deemed it meet:
4995,THE LADY,"The story went the round for years,"
4996,THE LADY,Till it came at last to the Bishop's ears.
4997,THE LADY,
4998,THE LADY,"Bishop of Bath and Wells was he,"
4999,THE LADY,Lord of the lords of Orchardleigh;
5000,THE LADY,And he wrote to the Parson the strongest screed
5001,THE LADY,That Bishop may write or Parson read.
5002,THE LADY,
5003,THE LADY,The sum of it was that a soulless hound
5004,THE LADY,Was known to be buried in hallowed ground:
5005,THE LADY,From scandal sore the Church to save
5006,THE LADY,They must take the dog from his master's grave.
5007,THE LADY,
5008,THE LADY,"The heir was far in a foreign land,"
5009,THE LADY,The Parson was wax to my Lord's command:
5010,THE LADY,He sent for the Sexton and bade him make
5011,THE LADY,A lonely grave by the shore of the lake.
5012,THE LADY,
5013,THE LADY,The Sexton sat by the water's brink
5014,THE LADY,Where he used to sit when he used to think:
5015,THE LADY,"He reasoned slow, but he reasoned it out,"
5016,THE LADY,And his argument left him free from doubt.
5017,THE LADY,
5018,THE LADY,"""A Bishop,"" he said, ""is the top of his trade;"
5019,THE LADY,But there's others can give him a start with the spade:
5020,THE LADY,"Yon dog, he carried the Squire ashore,"
5021,THE LADY,"And a Christian couldn't ha' done no more."""
5022,THE LADY,
5023,THE LADY,{191}
5024,THE LADY,
5025,THE LADY,The grave was dug; the mason came
5026,THE LADY,And carved on stone Fidele's name;
5027,THE LADY,But the dog that the Sexton laid inside
5028,THE LADY,Was a dog that never had lived or died.
5029,THE LADY,
5030,THE LADY,"So the Parson was praised, and the scandal stayed,"
5031,THE LADY,"Till, a long time after, the church decayed,"
5032,THE LADY,"And, laying the floor anew, they found"
5033,THE LADY,In the tomb of the Squire the bones of a hound.
5034,THE LADY,
5035,THE LADY,As for the Bishop of Bath and Wells
5036,THE LADY,No more of him the story tells;
5037,THE LADY,"Doubtless he lived as a Prelate and Prince,"
5038,THE LADY,And died and was buried a century since.
5039,THE LADY,
5040,THE LADY,And whether his view was right or wrong
5041,THE LADY,Has little to do with this my song;
5042,THE LADY,"Something we owe him, you must allow;"
5043,THE LADY,And perhaps he has changed his mind by now.
5044,THE LADY,
5045,THE LADY,"The Squire in the family chantry sleeps,"
5046,THE LADY,The marble still his memory keeps:
5047,THE LADY,"Remember, when the name you spell,"
5048,THE LADY,There rest Fidele's bones as well.
5049,THE LADY,
5050,THE LADY,"For the Sexton's grave you need not search,"
5051,THE LADY,'Tis a nameless mound by the island church:
5052,THE LADY,"An ignorant fellow, of humble lot--"
5053,THE LADY,But he knew one thing that a Bishop did not.

5067,THE LADY,Ruddy of cheek is John and bright of eye;

5069,THE LADY,"Civil enough, but short: perhaps he thinks:"
5070,THE LADY,"Words come once in a mile, and always dry."
5071,THE LADY,
5072,THE LADY,Has he a mind or not?  I wonder; but soon
5073,THE LADY,"We turn through a leafless wood, and there to the right,"
5074,THE LADY,"Like a sun bewitched in alien realms of night,"
5075,THE LADY,Mellow and yellow and rounded hangs the moon.
5076,THE LADY,
5077,THE LADY,"Strangely near she seems, and terribly great:"
5078,THE LADY,The world is dead: why are we travelling still?
5079,THE LADY,Nightmare silence grips my struggling will;

6053,"EXETER,","NOTE.--The foregoing parody, which first appeared in _The Monthly"
6054,"EXETER,","Review_ some years ago, was an attempt to sum up and commemorate a"
6055,"EXETER,","literary discussion of the day.  On Saturday night, November 15, 1902,"
6056,"EXETER,","at the Working Men's College, Great Ormond Street, Sir Edward Clarke,"
6057,"EXETER,","K.C., delivered an address on ""The Glory and Decay of English"
6058,"EXETER,","Literature in the Reign of Victoria."" 'Sir Edward Clarke, who mentioned"
6059,"EXETER,","incidentally that he lectured at the college forty years ago, said that"
6060,"EXETER,",there was a rise from the {229} beginning of that reign to the period
6061,"EXETER,","1850-60, and that from the latter date there had been a very strange"
6062,"EXETER,","and lamentable decline to the end of the reign, would he thought, be"
6063,"EXETER,",amply demonstrated.  A glorious galaxy of talent adorned the years
6064,"EXETER,","1850-60.  There were two great poets, two great novelists, and two"
6065,"EXETER,",great historians.  The two great poets were Alfred Tennyson and Robert
6066,"EXETER,",Browning.  The first named would always stand at the head of the
6067,"EXETER,",literature of the Victorian period.  There was no poet in the whole
6068,"EXETER,",course of our history whose works were more likely to live as a
6069,"EXETER,","complete whole than he, and there was not a line which his friends"
6070,"EXETER,",would wish to see blotted out.  Robert Browning was a poet of strange
6071,"EXETER,",inequality and of extraordinary and fantastic methods in his
6072,"EXETER,","composition.  However much one could enjoy some of his works, one could"
6073,"EXETER,",only hope that two-thirds of them would be as promptly as possible
6074,"EXETER,","forgotten--not, however, from any moral objection to what he wrote.  He"
6075,"EXETER,","was the Carlyle of poetry.  By his Lives of Schiller and Sterling,"
6076,"EXETER,","Carlyle showed that he _could_ write beautiful and pure English, but"
6077,"EXETER,",that he should descend to the style of some of his later works was a
6078,"EXETER,",melancholy example of misdirected energy. . . .  Charles Dickens was
6079,"EXETER,",perhaps the most extraordinary genius of those who had endeavoured to
6080,"EXETER,",deal with fiction as illustrative of the actual experiences of life.
6081,"EXETER,","With Dickens there stood the great figure of Thackeray, who had left a"
6082,"EXETER,","great collection of books, very unequal in their quality, but"
6083,"EXETER,",containing amongst them some of the finest things ever written in the
6084,"EXETER,",English tongue.  The two great historians were Macaulay and Froude.
6085,"EXETER,",To-day we had no great novelist.  Would anyone suggest we had a poet?
6086,"EXETER,",(Laughter.)  After the year 1860 there were two great names in
6087,"EXETER,",poetry--the two Rossettis.  There had been no book produced in the last
6088,"EXETER,",ten years which could compete with any one of the books produced from
6089,"EXETER,",1850 to 1860.'
6090,"EXETER,",
6091,"EXETER,",To this Mr. Edmund Gosse replied a week later at the Dinner of the
6092,"EXETER,",Encyclopaedia Britannica.  He reminded his audience that even the most
6093,"EXETER,",perspicuous people in past times had made the grossest blunders when
6094,"EXETER,",they judged their own age.  Let them remember the insensibility of
6095,"EXETER,","Montaigne to the merits of all his contemporaries.  In the next age,"
6096,"EXETER,","and in their own country, Ben Jonson took occasion at the very moment"
6097,"EXETER,","when Shakespeare was producing his masterpieces, to lament the total"
6098,"EXETER,",decay of poetry in England.  We could not see the trees for the wood
6099,"EXETER,","behind them, but we ought to be confident they were growing all the"
6100,"EXETER,",time.

6103,"EXETER,",
6104,"EXETER,","Mr. Gosse also wrote to the _Times_ on behalf of ""the Profession"" of"
6105,"EXETER,","Letters, reminding Sir Edward of the names of Swinburne and William"
6106,"EXETER,","Morris, Hardy and Stevenson, Creighton and Gardiner, and asking what"
6107,"EXETER,",would be the feelings of the learned gentleman if Meredith or Leslie
6108,"EXETER,",Stephen (of whose existence he was perhaps unaware) should put the
6109,"EXETER,","question in public, ""Would anyone suggest we have an Advocate?"""
6110,"EXETER,",
6111,"EXETER,","Sir Edward, in his rejoinder, had no difficulty in showing that Mr."
6112,"EXETER,",Gosse's citation of Montaigne and Jonson was not verbally exact.  Mr.
6113,"EXETER,",Birrell added some comments which were distinguished by being printed
6114,"EXETER,",in type of a markedly different size.
6115,"EXETER,",
6116,"EXETER,","To the author of these lines, the controversy appears so typical and so"
6117,"EXETER,","likely to arise again, that he desires to record, in however slight a"
6118,"EXETER,","form, his recollection of it, and his own personal bias, which is in no"
6119,"EXETER,",degree lessened by reconsideration after ten years.
