34,BROWN WILLIAM,"the darkness of his complexion_, _who was shot at Hango Hill_, _near"

36,BROWN WILLIAM,"alleged treason to the Derby family_, _who long possessed the sovereignty"
37,BROWN WILLIAM,"of Man_. . . ._ The ballad of_ “_Brown William_,” _which gives an account"
38,BROWN WILLIAM,"of the betrayal of the poor patriot_, _and the vengeance taken by the"

40,BROWN WILLIAM,songs of Ellan Vannin_.
41,BROWN WILLIAM,
42,BROWN WILLIAM,"Let no one in greatness too confident be,"
43,BROWN WILLIAM,"Nor trust in his kindred, though high their degree;"
44,BROWN WILLIAM,For envy and rage will lay any man low:

46,BROWN WILLIAM,
47,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thou wast the Receiver of Mona’s fair state,"
48,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy conduct was noble, thy wisdom was great,"

50,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
51,BROWN WILLIAM,
52,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy right hand was Earley, and Theah thy right eye;"
53,BROWN WILLIAM,Thy state caused thy foemen with rage to swell high;
54,BROWN WILLIAM,And envy and rage will lay any man low:
55,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
56,BROWN WILLIAM,
57,BROWN WILLIAM,How blest thy condition in fair Ronaldsway!
58,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy mansion, how stately! thy garden, how gay!"
59,BROWN WILLIAM,But oh! what disasters from envy do flow:
60,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
61,BROWN WILLIAM,
62,BROWN WILLIAM,"’Twas said at thy trial, by men void of faith,"
63,BROWN WILLIAM,"The king, by a letter, demanded thy death;"
64,BROWN WILLIAM,"The jury was frighten’d, and dared not say “No!”"
65,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
66,BROWN WILLIAM,
67,BROWN WILLIAM,The clan of wild Colcad could ne’er be at rest
68,BROWN WILLIAM,Whilst the race of Christeen their own acres possess’d;
69,BROWN WILLIAM,And envy and spite will bring any man low:
70,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
71,BROWN WILLIAM,
72,BROWN WILLIAM,"A band of adulterers, curst and unholy,"
73,BROWN WILLIAM,"For Ronaldsway lust, as they did for Logh Molley;"
74,BROWN WILLIAM,"Of Naboth, the tragedy’s played here anew:"
75,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
76,BROWN WILLIAM,
77,BROWN WILLIAM,"Not one of the band but received his just meed,"
78,BROWN WILLIAM,Who acted a part in that damnable deed;
79,BROWN WILLIAM,To dwindle away the whole band was not slow:
80,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
81,BROWN WILLIAM,
82,BROWN WILLIAM,"To Callaghyn-doo, and to Vannyster roam,"
83,BROWN WILLIAM,And call on the Colcad till hoarse ye become;
84,BROWN WILLIAM,"Gone, gone is the name so well known long ago:"
85,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
86,BROWN WILLIAM,
87,BROWN WILLIAM,"A cripple was Robin for many years long,"
88,BROWN WILLIAM,Who troubled and bullied the island when strong;
89,BROWN WILLIAM,His own friends of tending him weary did grow:
90,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
91,BROWN WILLIAM,
92,BROWN WILLIAM,"Sly Richard took ship with thy blood on his hand,"
93,BROWN WILLIAM,But God can avenge on the sea as on land;
94,BROWN WILLIAM,"The waves would not bear him, but whelm’d him, I trow:"
95,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
96,BROWN WILLIAM,
97,BROWN WILLIAM,"And now, if a few of the seed do remain,"
98,BROWN WILLIAM,They’re vile as the thistles and briars of the plain;
99,BROWN WILLIAM,They ply for their neighbours the pick and the hoe:
100,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
101,BROWN WILLIAM,
102,BROWN WILLIAM,"Should ye walk through all Man you’ll find no one, I reckon,"
103,BROWN WILLIAM,To mourn for the name that was once in Beemachan;
104,BROWN WILLIAM,But thousands of poor who rejoice that ’tis low:
105,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
106,BROWN WILLIAM,
107,BROWN WILLIAM,"Proceed to Creganyn, and Balla-logh green,"
108,BROWN WILLIAM,But where’s there a Colcad to bid ye walk in?
109,BROWN WILLIAM,By strangers their homes and their lands are held now:
110,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
111,BROWN WILLIAM,
112,BROWN WILLIAM,"Great Scarlett, in wealth who dwelt down by the bay,"
113,BROWN WILLIAM,Must toil now with paupers for sixpence a-day;
114,BROWN WILLIAM,"And oft, as I’ve heard, has no morsel to chew:"
115,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
116,BROWN WILLIAM,
117,BROWN WILLIAM,The band by whose weapons the great Cæsar died
118,BROWN WILLIAM,"Were hunted by foes, and all peace were denied;"
119,BROWN WILLIAM,"Not one died the death of kind Nature, O, no!"
120,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
121,BROWN WILLIAM,
122,BROWN WILLIAM,"So it fared with the band by whom Willie did die,"
123,BROWN WILLIAM,"Their lands are a waste, their names stink to the sky;"
124,BROWN WILLIAM,They melted like rime in the ruddy sun’s glow:
125,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
126,BROWN WILLIAM,
127,BROWN WILLIAM,"But comfort I take, for ’tis common report"
128,BROWN WILLIAM,"There are shoots of dear Will who are sitting at court,"
129,BROWN WILLIAM,"Who have punished his foes by king’s mandate, although"
130,BROWN WILLIAM,"Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe."
131,BROWN WILLIAM,
132,BROWN WILLIAM,"O, ’tis pleasant to think, when one’s wither’d and grey,"
133,BROWN WILLIAM,"There’s race of Brown William in fair Ronaldsway,"
134,BROWN WILLIAM,"That his foemen are crush’d, and their faces can’t show,"
135,BROWN WILLIAM,While the clan of Christeen have no trouble or woe. {10}
136,BROWN WILLIAM,
137,BROWN WILLIAM,"To the counsellors false, both in church and in state,"
138,BROWN WILLIAM,"Bear the public of Mona both loathing and hate,"
139,BROWN WILLIAM,"Who set man against man, and the peace would break now,"
140,BROWN WILLIAM,"As thy murder, Brown William, broke hearts long ago."
141,BROWN WILLIAM,
142,BROWN WILLIAM,"The lord of our island, Duke Athol the great,"
143,BROWN WILLIAM,"They would gladly persuade, with their parle and their prate,"
144,BROWN WILLIAM,"The corner-stones high of his house to lay low,"
145,BROWN WILLIAM,"And to King, Duke and Mona are foemen, I trow."

352,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
353,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"Abroad his black wings the Raven threw,"

366,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Dashing the wine on the marble floor.
367,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
368,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"Hildebrand hies him into the stall,"
369,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,There he beholds the coursers all.
370,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
371,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"He viewed the brown, and the gray as well,"
372,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,On the black he laid the gilded selle.
373,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
374,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Blacklille, Blacklille, if me thou’lt bear,"
375,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Thou on winnowed wheat all thy days shalt fare.”

377,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Then willingly, willingly, thee I’ll bear,"
378,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,But to breathe my name thou must not dare.”
379,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
380,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"He placed himself Blacklille’s back upon,"
381,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,And across the sea then away he ran.
382,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
383,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"And when to the midst of the Sound they came,"
384,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,He in evil hour uttered Blacklille’s name.
385,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
386,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"Blacklille quickly swam to the land,"
387,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,But down to the bottom sank Hildebrand.
388,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
389,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"On the Ting stood the damsel at break of day,"
390,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Then heard she afar off Blacklille neigh.
391,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
392,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"Blacklille ran towards the Ting in wrath,"
393,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Back scattered both women and men from his path.
394,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
395,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"Blacklille he kicked, the Raven he hewed,"
396,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,With the blood of men was his beak embrued.
397,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
398,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"Black took on his back the fair young dame,"
399,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,He went from the Ting and with her was tame.
400,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
401,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"And when they reached the yellow sand,"
402,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Upon it was standing Hildebrand.
403,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
404,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Welcome, sweet Kirsten, dear sister mine,"
405,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Why is so pallid that cheek of thine?”
406,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
407,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“The reason my cheek so pale is seen,"
408,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Is because I’ve far from my dear home been.”
409,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
410,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Now let no honest man,” she said,"
411,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,“Into foreign lands his daughter wed.
412,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
413,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Of gold perhaps he may get a store,"
414,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,But her happiness goeth for evermore.”
415,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
416,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Hildebrand kissed her o’er and o’er:
417,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“My darling sister, pray sorrow no more."
418,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
419,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Kirsten, I pray thee, pardon me"
420,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,For bringing thee into this misery.”
421,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
422,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,Then spake Blacklille as he stood:
423,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,“I’ve saved thee by shedding human blood.
424,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
425,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"“Give me, Kirsten, one little kiss,"
426,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,And the Raven one on that beak of his.”
427,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
428,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,On their mouths she kissed them both with glee—
429,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,From hideous thrall were they both set free.
430,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
431,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"She kissed them both with good will, I ween,"
432,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,They changed to her brothers who lost had been.
433,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,
434,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,"They all pressed her fondly to their breast,"
435,THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE,From sorrow and woe she is now at rest.

441,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
442,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
443,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"As one day I wandered lonely, in extreme distress of mind,"
444,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"I a pleasant garden entered, hoping comfort there to find."
445,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Up and down I paced the garden till an open space I spied,"
446,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"There I saw a crowd of people, and I heard a voice that cried:"
447,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"“Come and see what Love is doing, here is Love performing more"
448,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Wondrous feats than e’er were witnessed at Olympian games of yore:
449,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"This he conquers, that he conquers, young and old before him lie,"
450,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Great and small alike he conquers, none with him a fall must try."
451,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
452,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Hearing this at once I entered ’midst the crowd collected there,"
453,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Some of whom no doubt were eager like myself to banish care.
454,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"I would fain behold this being, this same wondrous lad survey,"
455,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Who ’twas said in each encounter bore with ease the prize away.
456,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Quickly I the crowd divided, soon I pierced the multitude,"
457,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"And this Love stood full before me, and what think you ’twas I view’d?"
458,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Why a boy, a little darling, full of captivating grace,"
459,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Rather roguish were his glances, but how lovely was his face!"
460,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
461,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Soon as I beheld this warrior gibings I began to throw
462,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,At the wretches who had suffered fell defeat from such a foe.
463,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Then, to me his visage turning, of the conquered standing by"
464,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"One replied, and in replying tears he shed abundantly:"
465,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"“O, poor youth,” ’twas thus he answered, “little, little dost thou know"
466,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"That in coming here thou comest not to joy, but bitter woe."
467,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Tears, and pains, and wounds most ghastly, wounds for which there is no"
468,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"cure,"
469,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Every kind of evil treatment such as no one can endure.”
470,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
471,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"When these words I heard him utter I was filled with bitter rage,"
472,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,And forthwith made preparation with the warrior to engage.
473,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"“Hearken, Master Love,” I shouted, “from this spot stir not away,"
474,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"You and I must have a battle, must engage in deadly fray;"
475,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,That it may be known for certain which is strongest of us two.”
476,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Then into the arena bounding there I stood in all men’s view,"
477,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"In the midst of it expecting firm the onset of the foe,"
478,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Doubting not should he attack me him at once to overthrow.
479,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Love he was not slow to follow with a blythe and joyous air,"
480,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Crying out, “My dearest fellow, for the fight yourself prepare!"
481,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Round the waist each other clasping now let’s strive like wrestlers true,"
482,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Do your best and I will show you what young Master Love can do.”
483,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
484,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Then around the waist I clasped him, he his arms around me wound,"
485,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Long we hugged and hugged each other, each his match in t’other found."
486,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Said at length the urchin to me: “Sadly tired, friend, am I,"
487,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Very much fatigued and weary, really friend just fit to die."
488,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Therefore take from me, I prythee, what thou anxiously hast sought,"
489,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,And for which in this arena with me gallantly hast fought.”
490,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
491,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Then a blast of wild consuming fire he breathed into my breast,"
492,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Straight my breast it quick enkindled, all deprived was I of rest,"
493,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Then he ran away exulting to some other wretched wight,"
494,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Such a zest he has for conflict, in such fray is his delight."
495,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
496,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"As for me I fell half senseless on the fatal, fatal spot,"
497,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Fierce consuming fire within me, never sure was one so hot."
498,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Rising up I followed shrieking, “Oh have mercy, Love, on me!"
499,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"See my tears, my sad affliction, cure me of my misery!”"
500,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
501,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Then he cried, “Dost not remember all the boasts thy lips out-pour’d?"
502,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,Know henceforth in every region Love is Conqueror and Lord.”
503,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,
504,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,"Thus he cried, and proudly left me, and wherever now I rove,"
505,THE WRESTLING-MATCH,I reproach myself for thinking I could vanquish mighty Love.
