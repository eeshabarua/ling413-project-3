49,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"OF the miscellaneous collection of verse that follows, only four pieces"
50,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"have been published, though many were written long ago, and other partly"
51,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,written.  In some few cases the verses were turned into prose and printed
52,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"as such, it having been unanticipated at that time that they might see"
53,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,the light.

55,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"Whenever an ancient and legitimate word of the district, for which there"
56,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"was no equivalent in received English, suggested itself as the most"
57,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"natural, nearest, and often only expression of a thought, it has been"
58,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"made use of, on what seemed good grounds."
59,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,
60,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,The pieces are in a large degree dramatic or personative in conception;
61,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,and this even where they are not obviously so.
62,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,
63,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,The dates attached to some of the poems do not apply to the rough
64,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"sketches given in illustration, which have been recently made, and, as"
65,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,"may be surmised, are inserted for personal and local reasons rather than"
66,PREFACE TO WESSEX POEMS,for their intrinsic qualities.

894,THE BURGHERS,"THE sun had wheeled from Grey’s to Dammer’s Crest,"
895,THE BURGHERS,And still I mused on that Thing imminent:
896,THE BURGHERS,At length I sought the High-street to the West.
897,THE BURGHERS,
898,THE BURGHERS,The level flare raked pane and pediment
899,THE BURGHERS,"And my wrecked face, and shaped my nearing friend"
900,THE BURGHERS,Like one of those the Furnace held unshent.
901,THE BURGHERS,
902,THE BURGHERS,"“I’ve news concerning her,” he said.  “Attend."
903,THE BURGHERS,They fly to-night at the late moon’s first gleam:
904,THE BURGHERS,Watch with thy steel: two righteous thrusts will end
905,THE BURGHERS,
906,THE BURGHERS,Her shameless visions and his passioned dream.
907,THE BURGHERS,"I’ll watch with thee, to testify thy wrong—"
908,THE BURGHERS,"To aid, maybe.—Law consecrates the scheme.”"
909,THE BURGHERS,
910,THE BURGHERS,"I started, and we paced the flags along"
911,THE BURGHERS,Till I replied: “Since it has come to this
912,THE BURGHERS,I’ll do it!  But alone.  I can be strong.”
913,THE BURGHERS,
914,THE BURGHERS,"Three hours past Curfew, when the Froom’s mild hiss"
915,THE BURGHERS,"Reigned sole, undulled by whirr of merchandize,"
916,THE BURGHERS,"From Pummery-Tout to where the Gibbet is,"
917,THE BURGHERS,
918,THE BURGHERS,"I crossed my pleasaunce hard by Glyd’path Rise,"
919,THE BURGHERS,"And stood beneath the wall.  Eleven strokes went,"
920,THE BURGHERS,"And to the door they came, contrariwise,"
921,THE BURGHERS,
922,THE BURGHERS,And met in clasp so close I had but bent
923,THE BURGHERS,My lifted blade upon them to have let
924,THE BURGHERS,Their two souls loose upon the firmament.
925,THE BURGHERS,
926,THE BURGHERS,But something held my arm.  “A moment yet
927,THE BURGHERS,As pray-time ere you wantons die!” I said;
928,THE BURGHERS,And then they saw me.  Swift her gaze was set
929,THE BURGHERS,
930,THE BURGHERS,With eye and cry of love illimited
931,THE BURGHERS,Upon her Heart-king.  Never upon me
932,THE BURGHERS,Had she thrown look of love so thorough-sped! . . .
933,THE BURGHERS,
934,THE BURGHERS,At once she flung her faint form shieldingly
935,THE BURGHERS,"On his, against the vengeance of my vows;"
936,THE BURGHERS,"The which o’erruling, her shape shielded he."
937,THE BURGHERS,
938,THE BURGHERS,"Blanked by such love, I stood as in a drowse,"
939,THE BURGHERS,"And the slow moon edged from the upland nigh,"
940,THE BURGHERS,My sad thoughts moving thuswise: “I may house
941,THE BURGHERS,
942,THE BURGHERS,"And I may husband her, yet what am I"
943,THE BURGHERS,But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair?
944,THE BURGHERS,"Says Charity, Do as ye would be done by.” . . ."
945,THE BURGHERS,
946,THE BURGHERS,"Hurling my iron to the bushes there,"
947,THE BURGHERS,"I bade them stay.  And, as if brain and breast"
948,THE BURGHERS,"Were passive, they walked with me to the stair."
949,THE BURGHERS,
950,THE BURGHERS,Inside the house none watched; and on we prest
951,THE BURGHERS,"Before a mirror, in whose gleam I read"
952,THE BURGHERS,"Her beauty, his,—and mine own mien unblest;"
953,THE BURGHERS,
954,THE BURGHERS,"Till at her room I turned.  “Madam,” I said,"
955,THE BURGHERS,“Have you the wherewithal for this?  Pray speak.
956,THE BURGHERS,Love fills no cupboard.  You’ll need daily bread.”
957,THE BURGHERS,
958,THE BURGHERS,"“We’ve nothing, sire,” said she; “and nothing seek."
959,THE BURGHERS,’Twere base in me to rob my lord unware;
960,THE BURGHERS,Our hands will earn a pittance week by week.”
961,THE BURGHERS,
962,THE BURGHERS,And next I saw she’d piled her raiment rare
963,THE BURGHERS,"Within the garde-robes, and her household purse,"
964,THE BURGHERS,"Her jewels, and least lace of personal wear;"
965,THE BURGHERS,
966,THE BURGHERS,"And stood in homespun.  Now grown wholly hers,"
967,THE BURGHERS,"I handed her the gold, her jewels all,"
968,THE BURGHERS,And him the choicest of her robes diverse.
969,THE BURGHERS,
970,THE BURGHERS,"“I’ll take you to the doorway in the wall,"
971,THE BURGHERS,"And then adieu,” I to them.  “Friends, withdraw.”"
972,THE BURGHERS,They did so; and she went—beyond recall.
973,THE BURGHERS,
974,THE BURGHERS,And as I paused beneath the arch I saw
975,THE BURGHERS,"Their moonlit figures—slow, as in surprise—"
976,THE BURGHERS,"Descend the slope, and vanish on the haw."
977,THE BURGHERS,
978,THE BURGHERS,"“‘Fool,’ some will say,” I thought.  “But who is wise,"
979,THE BURGHERS,"Save God alone, to weigh my reasons why?”"
980,THE BURGHERS,—“Hast thou struck home?” came with the boughs’ night-sighs.
981,THE BURGHERS,
982,THE BURGHERS,"It was my friend.  “I have struck well.  They fly,"
983,THE BURGHERS,But carry wounds that none can cicatrize.”
984,THE BURGHERS,"—“Not mortal?” said he.  “Lingering—worse,” said I."

1546,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1547,HER DEATH AND AFTER,The rooms within had the piteous shine

1549,HER DEATH AND AFTER,From the stairway floated the rise and fall
1550,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Of an infant’s call,"
1551,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Whose birth had brought her to this.
1552,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1553,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Her life was the price she would pay for that whine—
1554,HER DEATH AND AFTER,For a child by the man she did not love.
1555,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"“But let that rest for ever,” I said,"

1600,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1601,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"All that year and the next year whiled,"

1609,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Was treated ill when offspring came
1610,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Of the new-made dame,"
1611,HER DEATH AND AFTER,And marked a more vigorous line.

1613,HER DEATH AND AFTER,[Picture: Sketch of cemetery]
1614,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1615,HER DEATH AND AFTER,A smarter grief within me wrought

1617,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Dead the being whose soul my soul suffused,"
1618,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Her child ill-used,"
1619,HER DEATH AND AFTER,I helpless to interfere!

1621,HER DEATH AND AFTER,One eve as I stood at my spot of thought
1622,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"In the white-stoned Garth, brooding thus her wrong,"
1623,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Her husband neared; and to shun his view
1624,HER DEATH AND AFTER,By her hallowed mew
1625,HER DEATH AND AFTER,I went from the tombs among
1626,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1627,HER DEATH AND AFTER,To the Cirque of the Gladiators which faced—
1628,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"That haggard mark of Imperial Rome,"
1629,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Whose Pagan echoes mock the chime

1631,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"It was void, and I inward clomb."
1632,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1633,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Scarce night the sun’s gold touch displaced
1634,HER DEATH AND AFTER,From the vast Rotund and the neighbouring dead
1635,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"When her husband followed; bowed; half-passed,"
1636,HER DEATH AND AFTER,With lip upcast;
1637,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Then, halting, sullenly said:"

1639,HER DEATH AND AFTER,“It is noised that you visit my first wife’s tomb.

1649,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"—Sir, I’ve nothing more to say.”"
1650,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1651,HER DEATH AND AFTER,A desperate stroke discerned I then—
1652,HER DEATH AND AFTER,God pardon—or pardon not—the lie;
1653,HER DEATH AND AFTER,She had sighed that she wished (lest the child should pine
1654,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Of slights) ’twere mine,"
1655,HER DEATH AND AFTER,So I said: “But the father I.

1664,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"I’ll take her, and rear her, and spare you toil."
1665,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Think it more than a friendly act none can;
1666,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"I’m a lonely man,"
1667,HER DEATH AND AFTER,While you’ve a large pot to boil.

1669,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"“If not, and you’ll put it to ball or blade—"

1671,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"I’ll meet you here . . . But think of it,"
1672,HER DEATH AND AFTER,And in season fit
1673,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Let me hear from you again.”
1674,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1675,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"—Well, I went away, hoping; but nought I heard"
1676,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Of my stroke for the child, till there greeted me"
1677,HER DEATH AND AFTER,A little voice that one day came
1678,HER DEATH AND AFTER,To my window-frame
1679,HER DEATH AND AFTER,And babbled innocently:
1680,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1681,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"“My father who’s not my own, sends word"
1682,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"I’m to stay here, sir, where I belong!”"
1683,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Next a writing came: “Since the child was the fruit
1684,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Of your lawless suit,"
1685,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"Pray take her, to right a wrong.”"
1686,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1687,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"And I did.  And I gave the child my love,"
1688,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"And the child loved me, and estranged us none."
1689,HER DEATH AND AFTER,But compunctions loomed; for I’d harmed the dead
1690,HER DEATH AND AFTER,By what I’d said
1691,HER DEATH AND AFTER,For the good of the living one.
1692,HER DEATH AND AFTER,
1693,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"—Yet though, God wot, I am sinner enough,"
1694,HER DEATH AND AFTER,"And unworthy the woman who drew me so,"
1695,HER DEATH AND AFTER,Perhaps this wrong for her darling’s good

1739,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,No sin or sign of ill to be
1740,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,In one who walked so decently
1741,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The duteous helpmate’s round.
1742,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1743,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Two sons were born, and bloomed to men,"
1744,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And roamed, and were as not:"
1745,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Alone was Jenny left again
1746,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,As ere her mind had sought
1747,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"A solace in domestic joys,"
1748,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,And ere the vanished pair of boys
1749,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Were sent to sun her cot.
1750,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1751,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She numbered near on sixty years,"
1752,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And passed as elderly,"
1753,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"When, in the street, with flush of fears,"
1754,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"One day discovered she,"
1755,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,From shine of swords and thump of drum.
1756,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Her early loves from war had come,"
1757,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The King’s-Own Cavalry.
1758,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1759,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She turned aside, and bowed her head"
1760,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Anigh Saint Peter’s door;
1761,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,“Alas for chastened thoughts!” she said;
1762,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"“I’m faded now, and hoar,"
1763,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And yet those notes—they thrill me through,"
1764,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,And those gay forms move me anew
1765,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,As in the years of yore!” . . .
1766,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1767,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"’Twas Christmas, and the Phœnix Inn"
1768,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Was lit with tapers tall,"
1769,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,For thirty of the trooper men
1770,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Had vowed to give a ball
1771,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,As “Theirs” had done (’twas handed down)
1772,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,When lying in the selfsame town
1773,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Ere Buonaparté’s fall.
1774,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1775,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"That night the throbbing “Soldier’s Joy,”"
1776,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The measured tread and sway
1777,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Of “Fancy-Lad” and “Maiden Coy,”"
1778,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Reached Jenny as she lay
1779,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Beside her spouse; till springtide blood
1780,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Seemed scouring through her like a flood
1781,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,That whisked the years away.
1782,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1783,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She rose, and rayed, and decked her head"
1784,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Where the bleached hairs ran thin;
1785,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Upon her cap two bows of red
1786,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,She fixed with hasty pin;
1787,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Unheard descending to the street,"
1788,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She trod the flags with tune-led feet,"
1789,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,And stood before the Inn.
1790,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1791,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Save for the dancers’, not a sound"
1792,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Disturbed the icy air;
1793,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,No watchman on his midnight round
1794,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Or traveller was there;
1795,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"But over All-Saints’, high and bright,"
1796,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Pulsed to the music Sirius white,"
1797,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The Wain by Bullstake Square.
1798,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1799,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She knocked, but found her further stride"
1800,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Checked by a sergeant tall:
1801,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"“Gay Granny, whence come you?” he cried;"
1802,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,“This is a private ball.”
1803,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,—“No one has more right here than me!
1804,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Ere you were born, man,” answered she,"
1805,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,“I knew the regiment all!”
1806,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1807,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,“Take not the lady’s visit ill!”
1808,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Upspoke the steward free;
1809,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"“We lack sufficient partners still,"
1810,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"So, prithee let her be!”"
1811,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"They seized and whirled her ’mid the maze,"
1812,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,And Jenny felt as in the days
1813,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Of her immodesty.
1814,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1815,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Hour chased each hour, and night advanced;"
1816,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,She sped as shod with wings;
1817,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Each time and every time she danced—
1818,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Reels, jigs, poussettes, and flings:"
1819,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"They cheered her as she soared and swooped,"
1820,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,(She’d learnt ere art in dancing drooped
1821,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,From hops to slothful swings).
1822,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1823,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The favourite Quick-step “Speed the Plough”—
1824,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"(Cross hands, cast off, and wheel)—"
1825,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"“The Triumph,” “Sylph,” “The Row-dow-dow,”"
1826,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Famed “Major Malley’s Reel,”"
1827,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"“The Duke of York’s,” “The Fairy Dance,”"
1828,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"“The Bridge of Lodi” (brought from France),"
1829,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She beat out, toe and heel."
1830,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1831,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"The “Fall of Paris” clanged its close,"
1832,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And Peter’s chime told four,"
1833,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"When Jenny, bosom-beating, rose"
1834,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,To seek her silent door.
1835,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"They tiptoed in escorting her,"
1836,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Lest stroke of heel or clink of spur
1837,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Should break her goodman’s snore.
1838,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1839,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The fire that late had burnt fell slack
1840,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,When lone at last stood she;
1841,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Her nine-and-fifty years came back;
1842,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,She sank upon her knee
1843,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Beside the durn, and like a dart"
1844,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,A something arrowed through her heart
1845,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,In shoots of agony.
1846,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1847,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Their footsteps died as she leant there,"
1848,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Lit by the morning star
1849,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Hanging above the moorland, where"
1850,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The aged elm-rows are;
1851,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And, as o’ernight, from Pummery Ridge"
1852,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,To Maembury Ring and Standfast Bridge
1853,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"No life stirred, near or far."
1854,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1855,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Though inner mischief worked amain,"
1856,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,She reached her husband’s side;
1857,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Where, toil-weary, as he had lain"
1858,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Beneath the patchwork pied
1859,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"When yestereve she’d forthward crept,"
1860,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And as unwitting, still he slept"
1861,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Who did in her confide.
1862,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1863,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,A tear sprang as she turned and viewed
1864,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,His features free from guile;
1865,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"She kissed him long, as when, just wooed,"
1866,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,She chose his domicile.
1867,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,She felt she could have given her life
1868,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,To be the single-hearted wife
1869,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,That she had been erstwhile.
1870,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1871,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Time wore to six.  Her husband rose
1872,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,And struck the steel and stone;
1873,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"He glanced at Jenny, whose repose"
1874,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Seemed deeper than his own.
1875,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"With dumb dismay, on closer sight,"
1876,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"He gathered sense that in the night,"
1877,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Or morn, her soul had flown."
1878,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1879,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,When told that some too mighty strain
1880,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,For one so many-yeared
1881,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Had burst her bosom’s master-vein,"
1882,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,His doubts remained unstirred.
1883,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,His Jenny had not left his side
1884,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Betwixt the eve and morning-tide:
1885,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,—The King’s said not a word.
1886,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,
1887,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"Well! times are not as times were then,"
1888,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,Nor fair ones half so free;
1889,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And truly they were martial men,"
1890,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,The King’s-Own Cavalry.
1891,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,And when they went from Casterbridge
1892,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,"And vanished over Mellstock Ridge,"
1893,THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX,’Twas saddest morn to see.

2082,MY CICELY,Triple-ramparted Maidon gloomed grayly
2083,MY CICELY,"Above me from southward,"
2084,MY CICELY,"And north the hill-fortress of Eggar,"
2085,MY CICELY,And square Pummerie.

2087,MY CICELY,"The Nine-Pillared Cromlech, the Bride-streams,"
2088,MY CICELY,"The Axe, and the Otter"
2089,MY CICELY,"I passed, to the gate of the city"
2090,MY CICELY,Where Exe scents the sea;
2091,MY CICELY,
2092,MY CICELY,"Till, spent, in the graveacre pausing,"
2093,MY CICELY,I learnt ’twas not my Love
2094,MY CICELY,To whom Mother Church had just murmured
2095,MY CICELY,A last lullaby.
2096,MY CICELY,
2097,MY CICELY,"—“Then, where dwells the Canon’s kinswoman,"
2098,MY CICELY,My friend of aforetime?”—
2099,MY CICELY,(’Twas hard to repress my heart-heavings
2100,MY CICELY,And new ecstasy.)
2101,MY CICELY,
2102,MY CICELY,“She wedded.”—“Ah!”—“Wedded beneath her—
2103,MY CICELY,She keeps the stage-hostel
2104,MY CICELY,"Ten miles hence, beside the great Highway—"
2105,MY CICELY,The famed Lions-Three.
2106,MY CICELY,
2107,MY CICELY,“Her spouse was her lackey—no option
2108,MY CICELY,’Twixt wedlock and worse things;
2109,MY CICELY,A lapse over-sad for a lady
2110,MY CICELY,Of her pedigree!”
2111,MY CICELY,
2112,MY CICELY,"I shuddered, said nothing, and wandered"
2113,MY CICELY,To shades of green laurel:
2114,MY CICELY,Too ghastly had grown those first tidings
2115,MY CICELY,So brightsome of blee!
2116,MY CICELY,
2117,MY CICELY,"For, on my ride hither, I’d halted"
2118,MY CICELY,"Awhile at the Lions,"
2119,MY CICELY,And her—her whose name had once opened
2120,MY CICELY,My heart as a key—
2121,MY CICELY,
2122,MY CICELY,"I’d looked on, unknowing, and witnessed"
2123,MY CICELY,"Her jests with the tapsters,"
2124,MY CICELY,"Her liquor-fired face, her thick accents"
2125,MY CICELY,In naming her fee.
2126,MY CICELY,
2127,MY CICELY,"“O God, why this seeming derision!”"
2128,MY CICELY,I cried in my anguish:
2129,MY CICELY,"“O once Loved, O fair Unforgotten—"
2130,MY CICELY,That Thing—meant it thee!
2131,MY CICELY,
2132,MY CICELY,"“Inurned and at peace, lost but sainted,"
2133,MY CICELY,Were grief I could compass;
2134,MY CICELY,Depraved—’tis for Christ’s poor dependent
2135,MY CICELY,A cruel decree!”
2136,MY CICELY,
2137,MY CICELY,I backed on the Highway; but passed not
2138,MY CICELY,The hostel.  Within there
2139,MY CICELY,Too mocking to Love’s re-expression
2140,MY CICELY,Was Time’s repartee!
2141,MY CICELY,
2142,MY CICELY,"Uptracking where Legions had wayfared,"
2143,MY CICELY,"By cromlechs unstoried,"
2144,MY CICELY,"And lynchets, and sepultured Chieftains,"
2145,MY CICELY,"In self-colloquy,"
2146,MY CICELY,
2147,MY CICELY,A feeling stirred in me and strengthened
2148,MY CICELY,"That _she_ was not my Love,"
2149,MY CICELY,"But she of the garth, who lay rapt in"
2150,MY CICELY,Her long reverie.
2151,MY CICELY,
2152,MY CICELY,And thence till to-day I persuade me
2153,MY CICELY,That this was the true one;
2154,MY CICELY,That Death stole intact her young dearness
2155,MY CICELY,And innocency.
2156,MY CICELY,
2157,MY CICELY,"Frail-witted, illuded they call me;"
2158,MY CICELY,I may be.  ’Tis better
2159,MY CICELY,To dream than to own the debasement
2160,MY CICELY,Of sweet Cicely.
2161,MY CICELY,
2162,MY CICELY,Moreover I rate it unseemly
2163,MY CICELY,To hold that kind Heaven
2164,MY CICELY,Could work such device—to her ruin
2165,MY CICELY,And my misery.
2166,MY CICELY,
2167,MY CICELY,"So, lest I disturb my choice vision,"
2168,MY CICELY,"I shun the West Highway,"
2169,MY CICELY,"Even now, when the knaps ring with rhythms"
2170,MY CICELY,From blackbird and bee;
2171,MY CICELY,
2172,MY CICELY,And feel that with slumber half-conscious
2173,MY CICELY,"She rests in the church-hay,"
2174,MY CICELY,Her spirit unsoiled as in youth-time
2175,MY CICELY,When lovers were we.

2187,HER IMMORTALITY,
2188,HER IMMORTALITY,
2189,HER IMMORTALITY,UPON a noon I pilgrimed through
2190,HER IMMORTALITY,"A pasture, mile by mile,"
2191,HER IMMORTALITY,Unto the place where I last saw
2192,HER IMMORTALITY,My dead Love’s living smile.
2193,HER IMMORTALITY,
2194,HER IMMORTALITY,And sorrowing I lay me down
2195,HER IMMORTALITY,Upon the heated sod:
2196,HER IMMORTALITY,It seemed as if my body pressed
2197,HER IMMORTALITY,The very ground she trod.
2198,HER IMMORTALITY,
2199,HER IMMORTALITY,"I lay, and thought; and in a trance"
2200,HER IMMORTALITY,She came and stood me by—
2201,HER IMMORTALITY,"The same, even to the marvellous ray"
2202,HER IMMORTALITY,That used to light her eye.
2203,HER IMMORTALITY,
2204,HER IMMORTALITY,"“You draw me, and I come to you,"
2205,HER IMMORTALITY,"My faithful one,” she said,"
2206,HER IMMORTALITY,In voice that had the moving tone
2207,HER IMMORTALITY,It bore ere breath had fled.
2208,HER IMMORTALITY,
2209,HER IMMORTALITY,She said: “’Tis seven years since I died:
2210,HER IMMORTALITY,Few now remember me;
2211,HER IMMORTALITY,My husband clasps another bride;
2212,HER IMMORTALITY,My children’s love has she.
2213,HER IMMORTALITY,
2214,HER IMMORTALITY,"“My brethren, sisters, and my friends"
2215,HER IMMORTALITY,Care not to meet my sprite:
2216,HER IMMORTALITY,Who prized me most I did not know
2217,HER IMMORTALITY,Till I passed down from sight.”
2218,HER IMMORTALITY,
2219,HER IMMORTALITY,I said: “My days are lonely here;
2220,HER IMMORTALITY,I need thy smile alway:
2221,HER IMMORTALITY,"I’ll use this night my ball or blade,"
2222,HER IMMORTALITY,And join thee ere the day.”
2223,HER IMMORTALITY,
2224,HER IMMORTALITY,"A tremor stirred her tender lips,"
2225,HER IMMORTALITY,Which parted to dissuade:
2226,HER IMMORTALITY,"“That cannot be, O friend,” she cried;"
2227,HER IMMORTALITY,"“Think, I am but a Shade!"
2228,HER IMMORTALITY,
2229,HER IMMORTALITY,“A Shade but in its mindful ones
2230,HER IMMORTALITY,Has immortality;
2231,HER IMMORTALITY,"By living, me you keep alive,"
2232,HER IMMORTALITY,By dying you slay me.
2233,HER IMMORTALITY,
2234,HER IMMORTALITY,“In you resides my single power
2235,HER IMMORTALITY,Of sweet continuance here;
2236,HER IMMORTALITY,On your fidelity I count
2237,HER IMMORTALITY,Through many a coming year.”
2238,HER IMMORTALITY,
2239,HER IMMORTALITY,"—I started through me at her plight,"
2240,HER IMMORTALITY,So suddenly confessed:
2241,HER IMMORTALITY,"Dismissing late distaste for life,"
2242,HER IMMORTALITY,I craved its bleak unrest.
2243,HER IMMORTALITY,
2244,HER IMMORTALITY,"“I will not die, my One of all!—"
2245,HER IMMORTALITY,To lengthen out thy days
2246,HER IMMORTALITY,I’ll guard me from minutest harms
2247,HER IMMORTALITY,That may invest my ways!”
2248,HER IMMORTALITY,
2249,HER IMMORTALITY,She smiled and went.  Since then she comes
2250,HER IMMORTALITY,"Oft when her birth-moon climbs,"
2251,HER IMMORTALITY,Or at the seasons’ ingresses
2252,HER IMMORTALITY,Or anniversary times;
2253,HER IMMORTALITY,
2254,HER IMMORTALITY,"But grows my grief.  When I surcease,"
2255,HER IMMORTALITY,"Through whom alone lives she,"
2256,HER IMMORTALITY,"Ceases my Love, her words, her ways,"
2257,HER IMMORTALITY,Never again to be!

2266,THE IVY-WIFE,And be as high as he:
2267,THE IVY-WIFE,"I stretched an arm within his reach,"
2268,THE IVY-WIFE,And signalled unity.
2269,THE IVY-WIFE,"But with his drip he forced a breach,"
2270,THE IVY-WIFE,And tried to poison me.
2271,THE IVY-WIFE,
2272,THE IVY-WIFE,I gave the grasp of partnership
2273,THE IVY-WIFE,To one of other race—
2274,THE IVY-WIFE,A plane: he barked him strip by strip
2275,THE IVY-WIFE,From upper bough to base;
2276,THE IVY-WIFE,"And me therewith; for gone my grip,"
2277,THE IVY-WIFE,My arms could not enlace.
2278,THE IVY-WIFE,
2279,THE IVY-WIFE,In new affection next I strove
2280,THE IVY-WIFE,"To coll an ash I saw,"
2281,THE IVY-WIFE,And he in trust received my love;
2282,THE IVY-WIFE,Till with my soft green claw
2283,THE IVY-WIFE,I cramped and bound him as I wove . . .
2284,THE IVY-WIFE,Such was my love: ha-ha!
2285,THE IVY-WIFE,
2286,THE IVY-WIFE,By this I gained his strength and height
2287,THE IVY-WIFE,Without his rivalry.
2288,THE IVY-WIFE,But in my triumph I lost sight
2289,THE IVY-WIFE,"Of afterhaps.  Soon he,"
2290,THE IVY-WIFE,"Being bark-bound, flagged, snapped, fell outright,"
2291,THE IVY-WIFE,And in his fall felled me!

2298,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2299,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,AS evening shaped I found me on a moor
2300,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Which sight could scarce sustain:
2301,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"The black lean land, of featureless contour,"
2302,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Was like a tract in pain.
2303,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2304,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"“This scene, like my own life,” I said, “is one"
2305,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Where many glooms abide;
2306,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun—
2307,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Lightless on every side.
2308,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2309,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught"
2310,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,To see the contrast there:
2311,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought,"
2312,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,“There’s solace everywhere!”
2313,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2314,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood
2315,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,I dealt me silently
2316,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,As one perverse—misrepresenting Good
2317,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,In graceless mutiny.
2318,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2319,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Against the horizon’s dim-discernèd wheel
2320,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"A form rose, strange of mould:"
2321,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel"
2322,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Rather than could behold.
2323,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2324,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"“’Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent"

2327,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,On my new reasoning.
2328,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,
2329,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,“Yea—but await awhile!” he cried.  “Ho-ho!—
2330,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Look now aloft and see!”
2331,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,"I looked.  There, too, sat night: Heaven’s radiant show"
2332,A MEETING WITH DESPAIR,Had gone.  Then chuckled he.

2981,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,
2982,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,Then tender Tim Tankens he searched here and there

2989,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"There was one thing to do, and that one thing he did,"

2992,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"Tim turned to the winder, as modesty bid,"

2996,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"In the tallet he stowed her; there huddied she lay,"
2997,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"Shortening sleeves, legs, and tails to her limbs;"
2998,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"But most o’ the time in a mortal bad way,"
2999,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,Well knowing that there’d be the divel to pay
3000,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"If ’twere found that, instead o’ the elements’ prey,"
3001,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,She was living in lodgings at Tim’s.
3002,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,
3003,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,“Where’s the tranter?” said men and boys; “where can er be?”
3004,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,“Where’s the tranter?” said Barbree alone.
3005,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,“Where on e’th is the tranter?” said everybod-y:
3006,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"They sifted the dust of his perished roof-tree,"
3007,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,And all they could find was a bone.
3008,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,
3009,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"Then the uncle cried, “Lord, pray have mercy on me!”"
3010,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,And in terror began to repent.
3011,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"But before ’twas complete, and till sure she was free,"
3012,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"Barbree drew up her loft-ladder, tight turned her key—"
3013,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,Tim bringing up breakfast and dinner and tea—
3014,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,Till the news of her hiding got vent.
3015,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,
3016,THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S,"Then followed the custom-kept rout, shout, and flare"

3134,THE TWO MEN,Such press of power had brought much gold
3135,THE TWO MEN,Applied to things of meaner mould.
3136,THE TWO MEN,
3137,THE TWO MEN,Sometimes he wished his aims had been
3138,THE TWO MEN,To gather gains like other men;
3139,THE TWO MEN,Then thanked his God he’d traced his track
3140,THE TWO MEN,Too far for wish to drag him back.
3141,THE TWO MEN,
3142,THE TWO MEN,He lookèd from his loft one day
3143,THE TWO MEN,To where his slighted garden lay;
3144,THE TWO MEN,"Nettles and hemlock hid each lawn,"

3152,THE TWO MEN,"He met her with a careless air,"

3166,THE TWO MEN,
3167,THE TWO MEN,"And, living long so closely penned,"
3168,THE TWO MEN,He had not kept a single friend;
3169,THE TWO MEN,"He dwindled thin as phantoms be,"
3170,THE TWO MEN,And drooped to death in poverty . . .
3171,THE TWO MEN,
3172,THE TWO MEN,Meantime his schoolmate had gone out
3173,THE TWO MEN,To join the fortune-finding rout;
3174,THE TWO MEN,"He liked the winnings of the mart,"

3176,THE TWO MEN,
3177,THE TWO MEN,"He turned to seek a privy lair,"
3178,THE TWO MEN,"Neglecting note of garb and hair,"

3256,LINES,Vitalized without option: who shall say
3257,LINES,That did Life hang on choosing—Yea or Nay—
3258,LINES,"They had not scorned it with such penalty,"
3259,LINES,And nothingness implored of Destiny?
3260,LINES,
3261,LINES,And yet behind the horizon smile serene
3262,LINES,"The down, the cornland, and the stretching green—"
3263,LINES,Space—the child’s heaven: scenes which at least ensure
3264,LINES,Some palliative for ill they cannot cure.

3266,LINES,Dear friends—now moved by this poor show of ours
3267,LINES,To make your own long joy in buds and bowers
3268,LINES,"For one brief while the joy of infant eyes,"
3269,LINES,Changing their urban murk to paradise—
3270,LINES,You have our thanks!—may your reward include
3271,LINES,"More than our thanks, far more: their gratitude."
