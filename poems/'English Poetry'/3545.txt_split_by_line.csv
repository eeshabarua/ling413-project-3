31,PREFATORY NOTE,"This volume is a reprint, extended and revised, of the _Selected Poems_"
32,PREFATORY NOTE,"of Goldsmith issued by the Clarendon Press in 1887. It is ‘extended,’"
33,PREFATORY NOTE,because it now contains the whole of Goldsmith’s poetry: it is ‘revised’
34,PREFATORY NOTE,"because, besides the supplementary text, a good deal has been added in the"
35,PREFATORY NOTE,"way of annotation and illustration. In other words, the book has been"
36,PREFATORY NOTE,"substantially enlarged. Of the new editorial material, the bulk has been"
37,PREFATORY NOTE,collected at odd times during the last twenty years; but fresh Goldsmith
38,PREFATORY NOTE,facts are growing rare. I hope I have acknowledged obligation wherever it
39,PREFATORY NOTE,"has been incurred; I trust also, for the sake of those who come after me,"
40,PREFATORY NOTE,that something of my own will be found to have been contributed to the
41,PREFATORY NOTE,literature of the subject.

182,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
183,INTRODUCTION,
184,INTRODUCTION,
185,INTRODUCTION,"Two of the earlier, and, in some respects, more important _Memoirs_"
186,INTRODUCTION,"of Oliver Goldsmith open with a quotation from one of his minor works, in"
187,INTRODUCTION,which he refers to the generally uneventful life of the scholar. His own
188,INTRODUCTION,chequered career was a notable exception to this rule. He was born on the
189,INTRODUCTION,"10th of November, 1728, at Pallas, a village in the county of Longford in"
190,INTRODUCTION,"Ireland, his father, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith, being a clergyman of the"
191,INTRODUCTION,Established Church. Oliver was the fifth of a family of five sons and
192,INTRODUCTION,"three daughters. In 1730, his father, who had been assisting the rector of"
193,INTRODUCTION,"the neighbouring parish of Kilkenny West, succeeded to that living, and"
194,INTRODUCTION,"moved to Lissoy, a hamlet in Westmeath, lying a little to the right of the"
195,INTRODUCTION,road from Ballymahon to Athlone. Educated first by a humble relative named
196,INTRODUCTION,"Elizabeth Delap, the boy passed subsequently to the care of Thomas Byrne,"
197,INTRODUCTION,"the village schoolmaster, an old soldier who had fought Queen Anne’s"
198,INTRODUCTION,"battles in Spain, and had retained from those experiences a wandering and"
199,INTRODUCTION,"unsettled spirit, which he is thought to have communicated to one at least"
200,INTRODUCTION,"of his pupils. After an attack of confluent small-pox, which scarred him"
201,INTRODUCTION,"for life, Oliver was transferred from the care of this not-uncongenial"
202,INTRODUCTION,preceptor to a school at Elphin. From Elphin he passed to Athlone; from
203,INTRODUCTION,"Athlone to Edgeworthstown, where he remained until he was thirteen or"
204,INTRODUCTION,fourteen years of age. The accounts of these early days are contradictory.
205,INTRODUCTION,"By his schoolfellows he seems to have been regarded as stupid and heavy,—‘little"
206,INTRODUCTION,better than a fool’; but they
207,INTRODUCTION,
208,INTRODUCTION,"admitted that he was remarkably active and athletic, and that he was an"
209,INTRODUCTION,"adept in all boyish sports. At home, notwithstanding a variable"
210,INTRODUCTION,"disposition, and occasional fits of depression, he showed to greater"
211,INTRODUCTION,advantage. He scribbled verses early; and sometimes startled those about
212,INTRODUCTION,"him by unexpected ‘swallow-flights’ of repartee. One of these, an"
213,INTRODUCTION,oft-quoted retort to a musical friend who had likened his awkward antics
214,INTRODUCTION,"in a hornpipe to the dancing of Aesop,—"
215,INTRODUCTION,
216,INTRODUCTION,"Heralds! proclaim aloud! all saying,"
217,INTRODUCTION,
218,INTRODUCTION,"See _Aesop_ dancing, and his _monkey_ playing,—"
219,INTRODUCTION,
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,reads more like a happily-adapted recollection than the actual impromptu
222,INTRODUCTION,"of a boy of nine. But another, in which, after a painful silence, he"
223,INTRODUCTION,replied to the brutal enquiry of a ne’er-do-well relative as to when he
224,INTRODUCTION,"meant to grow handsome, by saying that he would do so when the speaker"
225,INTRODUCTION,"grew good,—is characteristic of the easily-wounded spirit and"
226,INTRODUCTION,‘exquisite sensibility of contempt’ with which he was to enter upon the
227,INTRODUCTION,battle of life.
228,INTRODUCTION,
229,INTRODUCTION,"In June, 1744, after anticipating in his own person, the plot of his later"
230,INTRODUCTION,play of _She Stoops to Conquer_ by mistaking the house of a
231,INTRODUCTION,"gentleman at Ardagh for an inn, he was sent to Trinity College, Dublin."
232,INTRODUCTION,The special dress and semi-menial footing of a sizar or poor scholar—for
233,INTRODUCTION,"his father, impoverished by the imprudent portioning of his eldest"
234,INTRODUCTION,"daughter, could not afford to make him a pensioner—were scarcely"
235,INTRODUCTION,"calculated to modify his personal peculiarities. Added to these, his tutor"
236,INTRODUCTION,"elect, Dr. Theaker Wilder, was a violent and vindictive man, with whom his"
237,INTRODUCTION,ungainly and unhopeful pupil found little favour. Wilder had a passion for
238,INTRODUCTION,"mathematics which was not shared by Goldsmith, who, indeed, spoke"
239,INTRODUCTION,"contemptuously enough of that science in after life. He could, however, he"
240,INTRODUCTION,"told Malone, ‘turn an Ode of Horace into English better than any of them.’"
241,INTRODUCTION,But his academic career was not a success.

247,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
248,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"In May, 1747, the year in which his father died,—an event that"
249,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"further contracted his already slender means,—he became involved in"
250,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"a college riot, and was publicly admonished. From this disgrace he"
251,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,recovered to some extent in the following month by obtaining a trifling
252,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"money exhibition, a triumph which he unluckily celebrated by a party at"
253,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his rooms. Into these festivities, the heinousness of which was aggravated"
254,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"by the fact that they included guests of both sexes, the exasperated"
255,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Wilder made irruption, and summarily terminated the proceedings by"
256,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,knocking down the host. The disgrace was too much for the poor lad. He
257,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"forthwith sold his books and belongings, and ran away, vaguely bound for"
258,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"America. But after considerable privations, including the achievement of a"
259,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"destitution so complete that a handful of grey peas, given him by a girl"
260,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"at a wake, seemed a banquet, he turned his steps homeward, and, a"
261,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"reconciliation having been patched up with his tutor, he was received once"
262,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"more at college. In February, 1749, he took his degree, a low one, as"
263,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"B.A., and quitted the university, leaving behind him, for relics of that"
264,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"time, a scratched signature upon a window-pane, a _folio_ Scapula"
265,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"scored liberally with ‘promises to pay,’ and a reputation for much"
266,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,loitering at the college gates in the study of passing humanity. Another
267,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,habit which his associates recalled was his writing of ballads when in
268,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,want of funds. These he would sell at five shillings apiece; and would
269,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,afterwards steal out in the twilight to hear them sung to the
270,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,indiscriminate but applauding audience of the Dublin streets.
271,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
272,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"What was to be done with a genius so unstable, so erratic? Nothing,"
273,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"apparently, but to let him qualify for orders, and for this he is too"
274,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"young. Thereupon ensues a sort of ‘Martin’s summer’ in his changing life,—a"
275,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"disengaged, delightful time when ‘Master Noll’ wanders"
276,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"irresponsibly from house to house, fishing and flute-playing, or, of"
277,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"winter evenings, taking the chair at the village inn. When at last the"
278,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"moment came for his presentation to the Bishop of Elphin, that prelate,"
279,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"sad to say, rejected him, perhaps because of his college reputation,"
280,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"perhaps because of actual incompetence, perhaps even, as tradition"
281,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"affirms, because he had the bad taste to appear before his examiner in"
282,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"flaming scarlet breeches. After this rebuff, tutoring was next tried. But"
283,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"he had no sooner saved some thirty pounds by teaching, than he threw up"
284,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his engagement, bought a horse, and started once more for America, by way"
285,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of Cork. In six weeks he had returned penniless, having substituted for"
286,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his roadster a sorry jade, to which he gave the contemptuous name of"
287,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Fiddleback. He had also the simplicity to wonder, on this occasion, that"
288,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,his mother was not rejoiced to see him again. His next ambition was to be
289,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"a lawyer; and, to this end, a kindly Uncle Contarine equipped him with"
290,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,fifty pounds for preliminary studies. But on his way to London he was
291,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"decoyed into gambling, lost every farthing, and came home once more in"
292,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"bitter self-abasement. Having now essayed both divinity and law, his next"
293,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"attempt was physic; and, in 1752, fitted out afresh by his long-suffering"
294,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"uncle, he started for, and succeeded in reaching, Edinburgh. Here more"
295,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,memories survive of his social qualities than of his studies; and two
296,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"years later he left the Scottish capital for Leyden, rather, it may be"
297,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"conjectured, from a restless desire to see the world than really to"
298,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,exchange the lectures of Monro for the lectures of Albinus. At Newcastle
299,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,(according to his own account) he had the good fortune to be locked up as
300,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"a Jacobite, and thus escaped drowning, as the ship by which he was to have"
301,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,sailed to Bordeaux sank at the mouth of the Garonne. Shortly afterwards he
302,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,arrived in Leyden. Gaubius and other Dutch professors figure
303,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
304,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,sonorously in his future works; but whether he had much experimental
305,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"knowledge of their instructions may be doubted. What seems undeniable is,"
306,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"that the old seduction of play stripped him of every shilling; so that,"
307,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"like Holberg before him, he set out deliberately to make the tour of"
308,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Europe on foot. _Haud inexpertus loquor,_ he wrote in after days,"
309,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,when praising this mode of locomotion. He first visited Flanders. Thence
310,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"he passed to France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, supporting himself"
311,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"mainly by his flute, and by occasional disputations at convents or"
312,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"universities. ‘Sir,’ said Boswell to Johnson, ‘he _disputed_ his"
313,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"passage through Europe.’ When on the 1st February, 1756, he landed at"
314,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Dover, it was with empty pockets. But he had sent home to his brother in"
315,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Ireland his first rough sketch for the poem of _The Traveller_.
316,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
317,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"He was now seven-and-twenty. He had seen and suffered much, but he was to"
318,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,have further trials before drifting definitely into literature. Between
319,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Dover and London, it has been surmised, he made a tentative appearance as"
320,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,a strolling player. His next ascertained part was that of an apothecary’s
321,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"assistant on Fish Street Hill. From this, with the opportune aid of an"
322,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Edinburgh friend, he proceeded—to use an eighteenth-century phrase—a"
323,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"poor physician in the Bankside, Southwark, where least of all, perhaps,"
324,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"was London’s fabled pavement to be found. So little of it, in fact, fell"
325,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"to Goldsmith’s share, that we speedily find him reduced to the rank of"
326,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"reader and corrector of the press to Samuel Richardson, printer, of"
327,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Salisbury Court, author of _Clarissa_. Later still he is acting"
328,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,as help or substitute in Dr. Milner’s ‘classical academy’ at Peckham.
329,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Here, at last, chance seemed to open to him the prospect of a literary"
330,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"life. He had already, says report, submitted a manuscript tragedy to"
331,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Richardson’s judgement; and something he said at Dr. Milner’s table
332,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,attracted the attention of an occasional
333,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"visitor there, the bookseller Griffiths, who was also proprietor of the"
334,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,_Monthly Review._ He invited Dr. Milner’s usher to try his hand
335,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"at criticism; and finally, in April, 1757, Goldsmith was bound over for a"
336,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,year to that venerable lady whom George Primrose dubs ‘the _antiqua
337,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"mater_ of Grub Street’—in other words, he was engaged for bed,"
338,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"board, and a fixed salary to supply copy-of-all-work to his master’s"
339,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,magazine.
340,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
341,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,The arrangement thus concluded was not calculated to endure. After some
342,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"five months of labour from nine till two, and often later, it came"
343,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"suddenly to an end. No clear explanation of the breach is forthcoming, but"
344,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,mere incompatability of temper would probably supply a sufficient ground
345,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"for disagreement. Goldsmith, it is said, complained that the bookseller"
346,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"and his wife treated him ill, and denied him ordinary comforts; added to"
347,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"which the lady, a harder taskmistress even than the _ antiqua mater_"
348,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"above referred to, joined with her husband in ‘editing’ his articles, a"
349,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"course which, hard though it may seem, is not unprecedented. However this"
350,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"may be, either in September or October, 1757, he was again upon the world,"
351,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,existing precariously from hand to mouth. ‘By a very little practice as a
352,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"physician, and very little reputation as a poet [a title which, as Prior"
353,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"suggests, possibly means no more than author], I make a shift to live.’ So"
354,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,he wrote to his brother-in-law in December. What his literary occupations
355,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"were cannot be definitely stated; but, if not prepared before, they"
356,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,probably included the translation of a remarkable work issued by Griffiths
357,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,and others in the ensuing February. This was the _Memoirs of a
358,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Protestant, condemned to the Galleys of France for his Religion,_"
359,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,being the authentic record of the sufferings of one Jean Marteilhe of
360,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Bergerac, a book of which Michelet has said that it is ‘written as if"
361,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"between earth and heaven.’ Marteilhe, who died at Cuylenberg"
362,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
363,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"in 1777, was living in Holland in 1758; and it may be that Goldsmith had"
364,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"seen or heard of him during his own stay in that country. The translation,"
365,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"however, did not bear Goldsmith’s name, but that of James Willington, one"
366,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of his old class-fellows at Trinity College. Nevertheless, Prior says"
367,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,distinctly that Griffiths (who should have known) declared it to be by
368,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Goldsmith. Moreover, the French original had been catalogued in Griffiths’"
369,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"magazine in the second month of Goldsmith’s servitude, a circumstance"
370,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,which colourably supplies the reason for its subsequent rendering into
371,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,English.
372,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
373,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,The publication of Marteilhe’s _Memoirs_ had no influence upon
374,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Goldsmith’s fortunes, for, in a short time, he was again installed at"
375,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Peckham, in place of Dr. Milner invalided, waiting hopefully for the"
376,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,fulfilment of a promise by his old master to procure him a medical
377,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"appointment on a foreign station. It is probably that, with a view to"
378,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"provide the needful funds for this expatriation, he now began to sketch"
379,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the little volume afterwards published under the title of _An Enquiry
380,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe_, for towards"
381,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the middle of the year we find him addressing long letters to his
382,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,relatives in Ireland to enlist their aid in soliciting subscriptions for
383,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"this book. At length the desired advancement was obtained,—a"
384,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,nomination as a physician and surgeon to one of the factories on the coast
385,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,of Coromandel. But banishment to the East Indies was not to be his
386,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,destiny. For some unexplained reason the project came to nothing; and then—like
387,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Roderick Random—he presented himself at Surgeons’ Hall for the more
388,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"modest office of a hospital mate. This was on the 21st of December, 1758."
389,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,The curt official record states that he was ‘found not qualified.’ What
390,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"made matters worse, the necessity for a decent appearance before the"
391,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"examiners had involved him in new obligations to Griffiths,"
392,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
393,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"out of which arose fresh difficulties. To pay his landlady, whose husband"
394,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"was arrested for debt, he pawned the suit he had procured by Griffiths’"
395,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,aid; and he also raised money on some volumes which had been sent him for
396,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,review. Thereupon ensued an angry and humiliating correspondence with the
397,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"bookseller, as a result of which Griffiths, nevertheless, appears to have"
398,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,held his hand.
399,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
400,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,By this time Goldsmith had moved into those historic but now non-existent
401,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"lodgings in 12 Green Arbour Court, Old Bailey, which have been"
402,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,photographed for ever in Irving’s _Tales of a Traveller._ It
403,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,was here that the foregoing incidents took place; and it was here also
404,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"that, early in 1759, ‘in a wretched dirty room, in which there was but one"
405,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"chair,’ the Rev. Thomas Percy, afterwards Bishop of Dromore, found him"
406,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,composing (or more probably correcting the proofs of) _The Enquiry._
407,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,‘At least spare invective ’till my book with Mr. Dodsley shall be
408,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"publish’d,’—he had written not long before to the irate Griffiths—‘and"
409,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,then perhaps you may see the bright side of a mind when my professions
410,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,shall not appear the dictates of necessity but of choice.’ _The
411,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Enquiry_ came out on the 2nd of April. It had no author’s name, but"
412,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,it was an open secret that Goldsmith had written it; and to this day it
413,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"remains to the critic one of the most interesting of his works. Obviously,"
414,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"in a duodecimo of some two hundred widely-printed pages, it was impossible"
415,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,to keep the high-sounding promise of its title; and at best its author’s
416,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"knowledge of the subject, notwithstanding his continental wanderings, can"
417,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,have been but that of an external spectator. Still in an age when critical
418,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"utterance was more than ordinarily full-wigged and ponderous, it dared to"
419,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"be sprightly and epigrammatic. Some of its passages, besides, bear upon"
420,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the writer’s personal experiences, and serve to piece the imperfections of"
421,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his biography. If it brought him no sudden wealth,"
422,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
423,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,it certainly raised his reputation with the book-selling world. A
424,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,connexion already begun with Smollett’s _Critical Review_ was
425,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,drawn closer; and the shrewd Sosii of the Row began to see the importance
426,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,of securing so vivacious and unconventional a pen. Towards the end of the
427,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,year he was writing for Wilkie the collection of periodical essays
428,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,entitled _The Bee_; and contributing to the same publisher’s
429,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_Lady’s Magazine_, as well as to _The Busy Body_ of"
430,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"one Pottinger. In these, more than ever, he was finding his distinctive"
431,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"touch; and ratifying anew, with every fresh stroke of his pen, his bondage"
432,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,to authorship as a calling.
433,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
434,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"He had still, however, to conquer the public. _The Bee_,"
435,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,although it contains one of his most characteristic essays (‘A City
436,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Night-Piece’), and some of the most popular of his lighter verses (‘The"
437,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Elegy on Mrs. Mary Blaize’), never attained the circulation essential to"
438,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"healthy existence. It closed with its eighth number in November, 1759. In"
439,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the following month two gentlemen called at Green Arbour Court to enlist
440,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the services of its author. One was Smollett, with a new serial, _"
441,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"The British Magazine_; the other was Johnson’s ‘Jack Whirler,’"
442,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,bustling Mr. John Newbery from the ‘Bible and Sun’ in St. Paul’s
443,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Churchyard, with a new daily newspaper, _The Public Ledger_."
444,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"For Smollett, Goldsmith wrote the ‘Reverie at the Boar’s Head Tavern’ and"
445,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the ‘Adventures of a Strolling Player,’ besides a number of minor papers."
446,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"For Newbery, by a happy recollection of the _Lettres Persanes_"
447,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of Montesquieu, or some of his imitators, he struck almost at once into"
448,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"that charming epistolary series, brimful of fine observation, kindly"
449,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"satire, and various fancy, which was ultimately to become the English"
450,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,classic known as _The Citizen of the World_. He continued to
451,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"produce these letters periodically until the August of the following year,"
452,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,when they were
453,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
454,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,announced for republication in ‘two volumes of the usual _Spectator_
455,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"size.’ In this form they appeared in May, 1762."
456,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
457,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,But long before this date a change for the better had taken place in
458,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Goldsmith’s life. Henceforth he was sure of work,—mere journey-work"
459,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"though much of it must have been;—and, had his nature been less"
460,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"improvident, of freedom from absolute want. The humble lodgings in the Old"
461,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Bailey were discarded for new premises at No. 6 Wine Office Court, Fleet"
462,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Street; and here, on the 31st of May, 1761, with Percy, came one whose"
463,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"name was often in the future to be associated with Goldsmith’s, the great"
464,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Dictator of London literary society, Samuel Johnson. Boswell, who made"
465,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Johnson’s acquaintance later, has not recorded the humours of that supper;"
466,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,but it marks the beginning of Goldsmith’s friendship with the man who of
467,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,all others (Reynolds excepted) loved him most and understood him best.
468,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
469,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,During the remainder of 1761 he continued busily to ply his pen. Besides
470,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,his contributions to _The Ledger_ and _The British
471,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Magazine_, he edited _The Lady’s Magazine_, inserting in"
472,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"it the _Memoirs of Voltaire_, drawn up some time earlier to"
473,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,accompany a translation of the _Henriade_ by his crony and
474,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,compatriot Edward Purdon. Towards the beginning of 1762 he was hard at
475,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"work on several compilations for Newbery, for whom he wrote or edited a"
476,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_History of Mecklenburgh_, and a series of monthly volumes of"
477,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,an abridgement of _Plutarch’s Lives_. In October of the same
478,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"year was published the _Life of Richard Nash_, apparently the"
479,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,outcome of special holiday-visits to the then fashionable watering-place
480,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of Bath, whence its fantastic old Master of the Ceremonies had only very"
481,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"lately made his final exit. It is a pleasantly gossiping, and not"
482,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"unedifying little book, which still holds a respectable place among its"
483,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,author’s minor works. But a recently discovered entry in an old ledger
484,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,shows that during the latter half
485,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
486,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of 1762 he must have planned, if he had not, indeed, already in part"
487,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"composed, a far more important effort, _The Vicar of Wakefield_."
488,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"For on the 28th of October in this year he sold to one Benjamin Collins,"
489,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"printer, of Salisbury, for 21 pounds, a third in a work with that title,"
490,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"further described as ‘2 vols. 12mo.’ How this little circumstance,"
491,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"discovered by Mr. Charles Welsh when preparing his Life of John Newbery,"
492,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"is to be brought into agreement with the time-honoured story, related"
493,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"(with variations) by Boswell and others, to the effect that Johnson"
494,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,negotiated the sale of the manuscript for Goldsmith when the latter was
495,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,arrested for rent by his incensed landlady—has not yet been
496,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"satisfactorily suggested. Possibly the solution is a simple one, referable"
497,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,to some of those intricate arrangements favoured by ‘the Trade’ at a time
498,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,when not one but half a score publishers’ names figured in an imprint. At
499,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"present, the fact that Collins bought a third share of the book from the"
500,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"author for twenty guineas, and the statement that Johnson transferred the"
501,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"entire manuscript to a bookseller for sixty pounds, seem irreconcilable."
502,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"That _The Vicar of Wakefield_ was nevertheless written, or was"
503,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"being written, in 1762, is demonstrable from internal evidence."
504,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
505,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,About Christmas in the same year Goldsmith moved into lodgings at
506,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Islington, his landlady being one Mrs. Elizabeth Fleming, a friend of"
507,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Newbery, to whose generalship this step seems attributable. From the"
508,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"curious accounts printed by Prior and Forster, it is clear that the"
509,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"publisher was Mrs. Fleming’s paymaster, punctually deducting his"
510,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"disbursements from the account current between himself and Goldsmith, an"
511,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,arrangement which as plainly indicates the foresight of the one as it
512,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,implies the improvidence of the other. Of the work which Goldsmith did for
513,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the businesslike and not unkindly little man, there is no very definite"
514,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"evidence; but various prefaces,"
515,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"introductions, and the like, belong to this time; and he undoubtedly was"
516,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the author of the excellent _ History of England in a Series of
517,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Letters addressed by a Nobleman to his Son_, published anonymously"
518,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"in June, 1764, and long attributed, for the grace of its style, to"
519,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Lyttelton, Chesterfield, Orrery, and other patrician pens. Meanwhile his"
520,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"range of acquaintance was growing larger. The establishment, at the"
521,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"beginning of 1764, of the famous association known afterwards as the"
522,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"‘Literary Club’ brought him into intimate relations with Beauclerk,"
523,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Reynolds, Langton, Burke, and others. Hogarth, too, is said to have"
524,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"visited him at Islington, and to have painted the portrait of Mrs."
525,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Fleming. Later in the same year, incited thereto by the success of"
526,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Christopher Smart’s _Hannah_, he wrote the Oratorio of _The"
527,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Captivity_, now to be found in most editions of his poems, but never"
528,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"set to music. Then after the slow growth of months, was issued on the 19th"
529,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,December the elaboration of that fragmentary sketch which he had sent
530,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"years before to his brother Henry from the Continent, the poem entitled"
531,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_The Traveller; or, A Prospect of Society_."
532,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
533,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"In the notes appended to _The Traveller_ in the present volume,"
534,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,its origin and progress are sufficiently explained. Its success was
535,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"immediate and enduring. The beauty of the descriptive passages, the subtle"
536,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"simplicity of the language, the sweetness and finish of the versification,"
537,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"found ready admirers,—perhaps all the more because of the contrast"
538,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,they afforded to the rough and strenuous sounds with which Charles
539,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Churchill had lately filled the public ear. Johnson, who contributed a few"
540,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"lines at the close, proclaimed _The Traveller_ to be the best"
541,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,poem since the death of Pope; and it is certainly not easy to find its
542,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,equal among the works of contemporary bards. It at once raised Goldsmith
543,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"from the condition of a clever newspaper essayist, or—as men like"
544,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Sir John
545,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Hawkins would have said—a mere ‘bookseller’s drudge,’ to the"
546,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,foremost rank among the poets of the day. Another result of its success
547,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"was the revival of some of his earlier work, which, however neglected by"
548,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the author, had been freely appropriated by the discerning pirate. In"
549,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"June, 1765, Griffin and Newbery published a little volume of _Essays"
550,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"by Mr. Goldsmith_, including some of the best of his contributions"
551,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"to _The Bee, The Busy Body, The Public Ledger_, and _The"
552,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"British Magazine_, besides ‘The Double Transformation’ and ‘The"
553,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Logicians Refuted,’ two pieces of verse in imitation of Prior and Swift,"
554,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,which have not been traced to an earlier source. To the same year belongs
555,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the first version of a poem which he himself regarded as his best work,"
556,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,and which still retains something of its former popularity. This was the
557,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"ballad of _Edwin and Angelina_, otherwise known as _The"
558,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Hermit_. It originated in certain metrical discussions with Percy,"
559,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,then engaged upon his famous _Reliques of English Poetry_; and
560,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"in 1765, Goldsmith, who through his friend Nugent (afterwards Lord Clare)"
561,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"had made the acquaintance of the Earl of Northumberland, printed it"
562,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,privately for the amusement of the Countess. In a revised and amended form
563,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,it was subsequently given to the world in _The Vicar of Wakefield_.
564,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
565,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,With the exception of an abortive attempt to resume his practice as a
566,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"medical man,—an attempt which seems to have been frustrated by the"
567,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"preternatural strength of his prescriptions,—the next memorable"
568,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,thing in Goldsmith’s life is the publication of _The Vicar of
569,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Wakefield_ itself. It made its appearance on the 27th of March,"
570,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"1766. A second edition followed in May, a third in August. Why, having"
571,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"been sold (in part) to a Salisbury printer as far back as October, 1762,"
572,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"it had remained unprinted so long; and why, when published, it was"
573,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"published by Francis Newbery and not by John Newbery, Goldsmith’s"
574,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
575,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"employer,—are questions at present unsolved. But the charm of this"
576,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,famous novel is as fresh as when it was first issued. Its inimitable
577,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"types, its happy mingling of Christianity and character, its wholesome"
578,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"benevolence and its practical wisdom, are still unimpaired. We smile at"
579,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the inconsistencies of the plot; but we are carried onward in spite of
580,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"them, captivated by the grace, the kindliness, the gentle humour of the"
581,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,story. Yet it is a mistake to suppose that its success was instantaneous.
582,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Pirated it was, of course; but, according to expert investigations, the"
583,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,authorized edition brought so little gain to its first proprietors that
584,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the fourth issue of 1770 started with a loss. The fifth, published in"
585,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"April, 1774, was dated 1773; and had apparently been withheld because the"
586,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"previous edition, which consisted of no more than one thousand copies, was"
587,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,not exhausted. Five years elapsed before the sixth edition made its tardy
588,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,appearance in 1779. These facts show that the writer’s contemporaries were
589,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,not his most eager readers. But he has long since appealed to the wider
590,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"audience of posterity; and his fame is not confined to his native country,"
591,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,for he has been translated into most European languages. Dr. Primrose and
592,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,his family are now veritable ‘citizens of the world.’
593,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
594,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"A selection of _Poems for Young Ladies_, in the ‘Moral’"
595,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,division of which he included his own _Edwin and Angelina_; two
596,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"volumes of _Beauties of English Poesy_, disfigured with strange"
597,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"heedlessness, by a couple of the most objectionable pieces of Prior; a"
598,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"translation of a French history of philosophy, and other occasional work,"
599,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,followed the publication of the _Vicar_. But towards the middle
600,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of 1766, he was meditating a new experiment in that line in which"
601,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Farquhar, Steele, Southerne, and others of his countrymen had succeeded"
602,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"before him. A fervent lover of the stage, he detested the vapid and"
603,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,colourless ‘genteel’
604,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,comedy which had gradually gained ground in England; and he determined to
605,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"follow up _The Clandestine Marriage_, then recently adapted by"
606,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Colman and Garrick from Hogarth’s _Marriage A-la-Mode_, with"
607,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"another effort of the same class, depending exclusively for its interest"
608,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"upon humour and character. Early in 1767 it was completed, and submitted"
609,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,to Garrick for Drury Lane. But Garrick perhaps too politic to traverse the
610,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"popular taste, temporized; and eventually after many delays and"
611,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"disappointments, _The Good Natur’d Man_, as it was called, was"
612,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"produced at Covent Garden by Colman on the 29th of January, 1768. Its"
613,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,success was only partial; and in deference to the prevailing craze for the
614,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"‘genteel,’ an admirable scene of low humour had to be omitted in the"
615,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"representation. But the piece, notwithstanding, brought the author 400"
616,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"pounds, to which the sale of the book, with the condemned passages"
617,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"restored, added another 100 pounds. Furthermore, Johnson, whose"
618,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"‘Suspirius’ in _The Rambler_ was, under the name of ‘Croaker,’"
619,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"one of its most prominent personages, pronounced it to be the best comedy"
620,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,since Cibber’s _Provok’d Husband_.
621,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
622,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"During the autumn of 1767, Goldsmith had again been living at Islington."
623,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"On this occasion he had a room in Canonbury Tower, Queen Elizabeth’s old"
624,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"hunting-lodge, and perhaps occupied the very chamber generally used by"
625,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"John Newbery, whose active life was, in this year, to close. When in"
626,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,London he had modest housing in the Temple. But the acquisition of 500
627,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,pounds for _The Good Natur’d Man_ seemed to warrant a change of
628,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"residence, and he accordingly expended four-fifths of that sum for the"
629,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"lease of three rooms on the second floor of No. 2 Brick Court, which he"
630,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"straightway proceeded to decorate sumptuously with mirrors, Wilton"
631,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"carpets, moreen curtains, and Pembroke tables. It was an unfortunate step;"
632,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,and he would have done well to remember the _Nil_
633,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_te quaesiveris extra_ with which his inflexible monitor, Johnson,"
634,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,had greeted his apologies for the shortcomings of some earlier lodgings.
635,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,One of its natural results was to involve him in a new sequence of
636,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"task-work, from which he never afterwards shook himself free. Hence,"
637,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,following hard upon a _Roman History_ which he had already
638,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"engaged to write for Davies of Russell Street, came a more ambitious"
639,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"project for Griffin, _A History of Animated Nature_; and after"
640,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"this again, another _History of England_ for Davies. The pay"
641,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"was not inadequate; for the first he was to have 250 guineas, for the"
642,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"second 800 guineas, and for the last 500 pounds. But as employment for the"
643,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"author of a unique novel, an excellent comedy, and a deservedly successful"
644,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"poem, it was surely—in his own words—‘to cut blocks with a"
645,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,razor.’
646,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
647,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"And yet, apart from the anxieties of growing money troubles, his life"
648,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,could not have been wholly unhappy. There are records of pleasant
649,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,occasional junketings—‘shoe-maker’s holidays’ he called them—in
650,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the still countrified suburbs of Hampstead and Edgware; there was the
651,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"gathering at the Turk’s Head, with its literary magnates, for his severer"
652,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"hours; and for his more pliant moments, the genial ‘free-and-easy’ or"
653,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"shilling whist-club of a less pretentious kind, where the student of mixed"
654,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,character might shine with something of the old supremacy of George
655,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Conway’s inn at Ballymahon. And there must have been quieter and more
656,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"chastened resting-places of memory, when, softening towards the home of"
657,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his youth, with a sadness made more poignant by the death of his brother"
658,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Henry in May, 1768, he planned and perfected his new poem of _The"
659,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Deserted Village_.
660,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
661,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"In December, 1769, the recent appointment of his friend Reynolds as"
662,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,President of the Royal Academy brought him the honorary office of
663,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Professor of History to that
664,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,institution; and to Reynolds _The Deserted Village_ was
665,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"dedicated. It appeared on the 26th of May, 1770, with a success equal, if"
666,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"not superior, to that of _The Traveller_. It ran through five"
667,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,editions in the year of its publication; and has ever since retained its
668,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"reputation. If, as alleged, contemporary critics ranked it below its"
669,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"predecessor, the reason advanced by Washington Irving, that the poet had"
670,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"become his own rival, is doubtless correct; and there is always a"
671,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"prejudice in favour of the first success. This, however, is not an"
672,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,obstacle which need disturb the reader now; and he will probably decide
673,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,that in grace and tenderness of description _The Deserted Village_
674,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,in no wise falls short of _The Traveller_; and that its central
675,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"idea, and its sympathy with humanity, give it a higher value as a work of"
676,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,art.
677,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
678,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"After _The Deserted Village_ had appeared, Goldsmith made a"
679,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"short trip to Paris, in company with Mrs. and the two Miss Hornecks, the"
680,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"elder of whom, christened by the poet with the pretty pet-name of ‘The"
681,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Jessamy Bride,’ is supposed to have inspired him with more than friendly"
682,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,feelings. Upon his return he had to fall again to the old ‘book-building’
683,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,in order to recruit his exhausted finances. Since his last poem he had
684,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,published a short _Life of Parnell_; and Davies now engaged him
685,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"on a _Life of Bolingbroke_, and an abridgement of the _Roman"
686,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"History_. Thus, with visits to friends, among others to Lord Clare,"
687,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,for whom he wrote the delightful occasional verses called _The Haunch
688,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of Venison_, the months wore on until, in December, 1770, the"
689,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,print-shops began to be full of the well-known mezzotint which Marchi had
690,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,engraved from his portrait by Sir Joshua.
691,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
692,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,His chief publications in the next two years were the above-mentioned
693,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_History of England_, 1771; _Threnodia Augustalis_,"
694,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"a poetical lament-to-order on the death of the Princess Dowager of Wales,"
695,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,1772; and the abridgement
696,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of the _Roman History_, 1772. But in the former year he had"
697,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"completed a new comedy, _She Stoops to Conquer; or, The Mistakes of a"
698,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Night_, which, after the usual vexatious negotiations, was brought"
699,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"out by Colman at Covent Garden on Monday, the 15th of March, 1773. The"
700,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,manager seems to have acted Goldsmith’s own creation of ‘Croaker’ with
701,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"regard to this piece, and even to the last moment predicted its failure."
702,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,But it was a brilliant success. More skilful in construction than _The
703,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Good Natur’d Man_, more various in its contrasts of character,"
704,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"richer and stronger in humour and _vis comica_, _She Stoops to"
705,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Conquer_ has continued to provide an inexhaustible fund of laughter
706,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"to more than three generations of playgoers, and still bids fair to retain"
707,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"the character generally given to it, of being one of the three most"
708,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"popular comedies upon the English stage. When published, it was gratefully"
709,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"inscribed, in one of those admirable dedications of which its author above"
710,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"all men possessed the secret, to Johnson, who had befriended it from the"
711,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"first. ‘I do not mean,’ wrote Goldsmith, ‘so much to compliment you as"
712,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"myself. It may do me some honour to inform the public, that I have lived"
713,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,many years in intimacy with you. It may serve the interests of mankind
714,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"also to inform them, that the greatest wit may be found in a character,"
715,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,without impairing the most unaffected piety.’
716,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
717,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,His gains from _She Stoops to Conquer_ were considerable; but
718,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,by this time his affairs had reached a stage of complication which nothing
719,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,short of a miracle could disentangle; and there is reason for supposing
720,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,that his involved circumstances preyed upon his mind. During the few
721,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"months of life that remained to him he published nothing, being doubtless"
722,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,sufficiently occupied by the undertakings to which he was already
723,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,committed. The last of his poetical efforts was the poem entitled
724,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
725,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_Retaliation_, a group of epitaph-epigrams prompted by some"
726,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,similar _jeux d’esprit_ directed against himself by Garrick and other
727,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"friends, and left incomplete at his death. In March, 1774, the combined"
728,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"effects of work and worry, added to a local disorder, brought on a nervous"
729,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"fever, which he unhappily aggravated by the use of a patent medicine"
730,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"called ‘James’s Powder.’ He had often relied upon this before, but in the"
731,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"present instance it was unsuited to his complaint. On Monday, the 4th of"
732,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"April, 1774, he died, in his forty-sixth year, and was buried on the 9th"
733,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"in the burying-ground of the Temple Church. Two years later a monument,"
734,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"with a medallion portrait by Nollekens, and a Latin inscription by"
735,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Johnson, was erected to him in Westminster Abbey, at the expense of the"
736,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Literary Club. But although the inscription contains more than one phrase
737,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"of felicitous discrimination, notably the oft-quoted _affectuum potens,"
738,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"at lenis dominator_, it may be doubted whether the simpler words used"
739,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,by his rugged old friend in a letter to Langton are not a fitter farewell
740,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"to Oliver Goldsmith,—‘Let not his frailties be remembered; he was a"
741,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,very great man.’
742,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
743,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,In person Goldsmith was short and strongly built. His complexion was
744,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"rather fair, but he was deeply scarred with small-pox; and—if we"
745,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,may believe his own account—the vicissitudes and privations of his
746,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,early life had not tended to diminish his initial disadvantages. ‘You
747,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"scarcely can conceive,’ he writes to his brother in 1759, ‘how much eight"
748,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"years of disappointment, anguish, and study, have worn me down. . . ."
749,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Imagine to yourself a pale melancholy visage, with two great wrinkles"
750,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"between the eye-brows, with an eye disgustingly severe, and a big wig; and"
751,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"you may have a perfect picture of my present appearance,’ i.e. at thirty"
752,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"years of age. ‘I can neither laugh nor drink,’ he goes on; ‘have"
753,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"contracted an hesitating, disagreeable manner of speaking, and a visage"
754,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"that looks ill-nature itself; in short, I have thought myself into a"
755,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"settled melancholy, and an utter disgust of all that life brings with it.’"
756,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,It is obvious that this description is largely coloured by passing
757,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"depression. ‘His features,’ says one contemporary, ‘were plain, but not"
758,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"repulsive,—certainly not so when lighted up by conversation.’"
759,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Another witness—the ‘Jessamy Bride’—declares that ‘his
760,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"benevolence was unquestionable, and his countenance bore every trace of"
761,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,it.’ His true likeness would seem to lie midway between the grotesquely
762,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"truthful sketch by Bunbury prefixed in 1776 to the _Haunch of Venison_,"
763,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"and the portrait idealized by personal regard, which Reynolds painted in"
764,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"1770. In this latter he is shown wearing, in place of his customary wig,"
765,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his own scant brown hair, and, on this occasion, masquerades in a furred"
766,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"robe, and falling collar. But even through the disguise of a studio"
767,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"‘costume,’ the finely-perceptive genius of Reynolds has managed to suggest"
768,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"much that is most appealing in his sitter’s nature. Past suffering,"
769,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"present endurance, the craving to be understood, the mute deprecation of"
770,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"contempt, are all written legibly in this pathetic picture. It has been"
771,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"frequently copied, often very ineffectively, for so subtle is the art that"
772,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,the slightest deviation hopelessly distorts and vulgarizes what Reynolds
773,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"has done supremely, once and for ever."
774,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
775,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Goldsmith’s character presents but few real complexities. What seems most
776,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"to have impressed his contemporaries is the difference, emphasized by the"
777,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"happily-antithetic epigram of Garrick, between his written style and his"
778,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"conversation; and collaterally, between his eminence as a literary man and"
779,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,his personal insignificance. Much of this is easily intelligible. He had
780,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"started in life with few temporal or physical advantages, and with a"
781,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,native susceptibility that intensified his defects. Until
782,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"he became a middle-aged man, he led a life of which we do not even now"
783,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,know all the degradations; and these had left their mark upon his manners.
784,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"With the publication of _The Traveller_, he became at once the"
785,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"associate of some of the best talent and intellect in England,—of"
786,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"fine gentlemen such as Beauclerk and Langton, of artists such as Reynolds"
787,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"and Garrick, of talkers such as Johnson and Burke. Morbidly"
788,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"self-conscious, nervously anxious to succeed, he was at once forced into a"
789,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,competition for which neither his antecedents nor his qualifications had
790,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"prepared him. To this, coupled with the old habit of poverty, must be"
791,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"attributed his oft-cited passion for fine clothes, which surely arose less"
792,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,from vanity than from a mistaken attempt to extenuate what he felt to be
793,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,his most obvious shortcomings. As a talker especially he was ill-fitted to
794,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"shine. He was easily disconcerted by retort, and often discomfited in"
795,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,argument. To the end of his days he never lost his native brogue; and (as
796,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"he himself tells us) he had that most fatal of defects to a narrator, a"
797,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,slow and hesitating manner. The perspicuity which makes the charm of his
798,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,writings deserted him in conversation; and his best things were momentary
799,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,flashes. But some of these were undoubtedly very happy. His telling
800,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Johnson that he would make the little fishes talk like whales; his
801,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,affirmation of Burke that he wound into a subject like a serpent; and
802,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,half-a-dozen other well-remembered examples—afford ample proof of
803,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,this. Something of the uneasy jealousy he is said to have exhibited with
804,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,regard to certain of his contemporaries may also be connected with the
805,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,long probation of obscurity during which he had been a spectator of the
806,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"good fortune of others, to whom he must have known himself superior. His"
807,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"improvidence seems to have been congenital, since it is to be traced ‘even"
808,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,from his boyish days.’ But though it cannot justly be ascribed to any
809,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"reaction from want to sufficiency, it can still less be supposed to have"
810,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"been diminished by that change. If he was careless of money, it must also"
811,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,be remembered that he gave much of it away; and fortune lingers little
812,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,with those whose ears are always open to a plausible tale of distress. Of
813,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,his sensibility and genuine kindheartedness there is no doubt. And it is
814,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"well to remember that most of the tales to his disadvantage come, not from"
815,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"his more distinguished companions, but from such admitted detractors as"
816,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Hawkins and Boswell. It could be no mean individuality that acquired the
817,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"esteem, and deserved the regret, of Johnson and Reynolds."
818,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
819,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,
820,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"In an edition of Goldsmith’s poems, any extended examination of his"
821,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"remaining productions would be out of place. Moreover, the bulk of these is"
822,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,considerably reduced when all that may properly be classed as hack-work has
823,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"been withdrawn. The histories of Greece, of Rome, and of England; the"
824,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_Animated Nature_; the lives of Nash, Voltaire, Parnell, and Bolingbroke,"
825,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"are merely compilations, only raised to the highest level in that line because"
826,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,they proceeded from a man whose gift of clear and easy exposition lent a charm
827,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"to everything he touched. With the work which he did for himself, the case is"
828,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"different. Into _The Citizen of the World_, _The Vicar of Wakefield_,"
829,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"and his two comedies, he put all the best of his knowledge of human nature, his"
830,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"keen sympathy with his kind, his fine common-sense and his genial humour. The"
831,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"same qualities, tempered by a certain grace and tenderness, also enter into the"
832,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,best of his poems. Avoiding the epigram of Pope and the austere couplet of
833,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Johnson, he yet borrowed something from each, which he combined with a delicacy"
834,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"and an amenity that he had learned from neither. He himself, in all"
835,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"probability, would have rested his fame on his three chief metrical efforts,"
836,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_The Traveller_, _The Hermit_, and _The Deserted Village_. But,"
837,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"as is often the case, he is remembered even more favourably by some of those"
838,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"delightful familiar verses, unprinted during his lifetime, which he threw off"
839,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,with no other ambition than the desire to amuse his friends.
840,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_Retaliation_, _ The Haunch of Venison_, the _Letter in Prose and"
841,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"Verse to Mrs. Bunbury_, all afford noteworthy exemplification of that"
842,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,playful touch and wayward fancy which constitute the chief attraction of this
843,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"species of poetry. In his imitations of Swift and Prior, and his variations"
844,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"upon French suggestions, his personal note is scarcely so apparent; but the two"
845,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,Elegies and some of the minor pieces retain a deserved reputation. His
846,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,ingenious prologues and epilogues also serve to illustrate the range and
847,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"versatility of his talent. As a rule, the arrangement in the present edition is"
848,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,chronological; but it has not been thought necessary to depart from the
849,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,practice which gives a time-honoured precedence to _The Traveller_ and
850,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"_The Deserted Village_. The true sequence of the poems, in their order of"
851,PANE OF GLASS WITH GOLDSMITH’S AUTOGRAPH,"publication, is, however, exactly indicated in the table which follows this"

1311,"DEAR SIR,","DEAR SIR,"
1312,"DEAR SIR,",I am sensible that the
1313,"DEAR SIR,",friendship between us can acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a
1314,"DEAR SIR,",Dedication; and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to prefix your name to
1315,"DEAR SIR,","my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this"
1316,"DEAR SIR,","Poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with"
1317,"DEAR SIR,","propriety, be only inscribed to you. It will also throw a light upon many"
1318,"DEAR SIR,","parts of it, when the reader understands, that it is addressed to a man,"
1319,"DEAR SIR,","who, despising Fame and Fortune, has retired early to Happiness and"
1320,"DEAR SIR,","Obscurity, with an income of forty pounds a year."
1321,"DEAR SIR,",
1322,"DEAR SIR,","I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of your humble choice. You"
1323,"DEAR SIR,","have entered upon a sacred office, where the harvest is great, and the"
1324,"DEAR SIR,","labourers are but few; while you have left the field of Ambition, where"
1325,"DEAR SIR,","the labourers are many, and the harvest not worth carrying away. But of"
1326,"DEAR SIR,","all kinds of ambition, what from the refinement of the times, from"
1327,"DEAR SIR,","different systems of criticism, and from the divisions of party, that"
1328,"DEAR SIR,",which pursues poetical fame is the wildest.
1329,"DEAR SIR,",
1330,"DEAR SIR,",Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations; but in a
1331,"DEAR SIR,","country verging to the extremes of refinement, Painting and Music come in"
1332,"DEAR SIR,",for a share. As these offer the feeble mind a less laborious
1333,"DEAR SIR,","entertainment,"
1334,"DEAR SIR,",
1335,"DEAR SIR,","they at first rival Poetry, and at length supplant her; they engross all"
1336,"DEAR SIR,","that favour once shown to her, and though but younger sisters, seize upon"
1337,"DEAR SIR,",the elder’s birthright.
1338,"DEAR SIR,",
1339,"DEAR SIR,","Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is still in"
1340,"DEAR SIR,",greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it.
1341,"DEAR SIR,","What criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verse, and"
1342,"DEAR SIR,","Pindaric odes, choruses, anapaests and iambics, alliterative care and"
1343,"DEAR SIR,",happy negligence! Every absurdity has now a champion to defend it; and as
1344,"DEAR SIR,","he is generally much in the wrong, so he has always much to say; for error"
1345,"DEAR SIR,",is ever talkative.
1346,"DEAR SIR,",
1347,"DEAR SIR,","But there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous, I mean Party."
1348,"DEAR SIR,","Party entirely distorts the judgment, and destroys the taste. When the"
1349,"DEAR SIR,","mind is once infected with this disease, it can only find pleasure in what"
1350,"DEAR SIR,","contributes to increase the distemper. Like the tiger, that seldom desists"
1351,"DEAR SIR,","from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh, the reader,"
1352,"DEAR SIR,","who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the"
1353,"DEAR SIR,",most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation. Such readers generally
1354,"DEAR SIR,","admire some half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having"
1355,"DEAR SIR,",lost the character of a wise one. Him they dignify with the name of poet;
1356,"DEAR SIR,","his tawdry lampoons are called satires, his turbulence is said to be"
1357,"DEAR SIR,","force, and his frenzy fire."
1358,"DEAR SIR,",
1359,"DEAR SIR,","What reception a Poem may find, which has neither abuse, party, nor blank"
1360,"DEAR SIR,","verse to support it, I cannot tell, nor am I solicitous to know. My aims"
1361,"DEAR SIR,","are right. Without espousing the cause of any party, I have attempted to"
1362,"DEAR SIR,","moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to show, that there may be"
1363,"DEAR SIR,","equal happiness in states, that are differently governed from our own;"
1364,"DEAR SIR,","that every state has a particular principle of happiness, and that this"
1365,"DEAR SIR,",principle in each may be carried to a mischievous excess. There are few
1366,"DEAR SIR,","can judge, better than yourself, how far these positions are illustrated"
1367,"DEAR SIR,",in this Poem.

1369,"DEAR SIR,","I am, dear Sir,"

1455,SOCIETY,May gather bliss to see my fellows bless’d.
1456,SOCIETY,
1457,SOCIETY,"But where to find that happiest spot below,"
1458,SOCIETY,"Who can direct, when all pretend to know?"
1459,SOCIETY,The shudd’ring tenant of the frigid zone                      65
1460,SOCIETY,"Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own,"
1461,SOCIETY,"Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,"

1465,SOCIETY,"Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,"

1467,SOCIETY,"Such is the patriot’s boast, where’er we roam,"
1468,SOCIETY,"His first, best country ever is, at home."

1471,SOCIETY,"Though patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find"
1472,SOCIETY,"An equal portion dealt to all mankind,"
1473,SOCIETY,"As different good, by Art or Nature given,"
1474,SOCIETY,To different nations makes their blessings even.              80
1475,SOCIETY,
1476,SOCIETY,"Nature, a mother kind alike to all,"
1477,SOCIETY,Still grants her bliss at Labour’s earnest call;
1478,SOCIETY,With food as well the peasant is supplied
1479,SOCIETY,On Idra’s cliffs as Arno’s shelvy side;
1480,SOCIETY,"And though the rocky-crested summits frown,                   85"
1481,SOCIETY,"These rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down."
1482,SOCIETY,From Art more various are the blessings sent;
1483,SOCIETY,"Wealth commerce, honour, liberty, content."
1484,SOCIETY,"Yet these each other’s power so strong contest,"
1485,SOCIETY,That either seems destructive of the rest.                    90
1486,SOCIETY,"Where wealth and freedom reign, contentment fails,"
1487,SOCIETY,And honour sinks where commerce long prevails.
1488,SOCIETY,"Hence every state to one lov’d blessing prone,"
1489,SOCIETY,Conforms and models life to that alone.
1490,SOCIETY,"Each to the favourite happiness attends,                      95"
1491,SOCIETY,And spurns the plan that aims at other ends;
1492,SOCIETY,"Till, carried to excess in each domain,"
1493,SOCIETY,This favourite good begets peculiar pain.
1494,SOCIETY,
1495,SOCIETY,"But let us try these truths with closer eyes,"
1496,SOCIETY,And trace them through the prospect as it lies:              100

1513,THE TRAVELLER,(R. Westall)
1514,THE TRAVELLER,
1515,THE TRAVELLER,"Could Nature’s bounty satisfy the breast,"
1516,THE TRAVELLER,The sons of Italy were surely blest.
1517,THE TRAVELLER,"Whatever fruits in different climes were found,"
1518,THE TRAVELLER,"That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground;"
1519,THE TRAVELLER,"Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,                     115"
1520,THE TRAVELLER,Whose bright succession decks the varied year;
1521,THE TRAVELLER,Whatever sweets salute the northern sky
1522,THE TRAVELLER,With vernal lives that blossom but to die;
1523,THE TRAVELLER,"These here disporting own the kindred soil,"
1524,THE TRAVELLER,Nor ask luxuriance from the planter’s toil;                  120
1525,THE TRAVELLER,While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand
1526,THE TRAVELLER,To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.
1527,THE TRAVELLER,
1528,THE TRAVELLER,"But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,"
1529,THE TRAVELLER,And sensual bliss is all the nation knows.
1530,THE TRAVELLER,"In florid beauty groves and fields appear,                   125"
1531,THE TRAVELLER,Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.
1532,THE TRAVELLER,Contrasted faults through all his manner reign;
1533,THE TRAVELLER,"Though poor, luxurious; though submissive, vain;"
1534,THE TRAVELLER,"Though grave, yet trifling; zealous, yet untrue;"
1535,THE TRAVELLER,And e’en in penance planning sins anew.                      130
1536,THE TRAVELLER,"All evils here contaminate the mind,"
1537,THE TRAVELLER,That opulence departed leaves behind;
1538,THE TRAVELLER,"For wealth was theirs, not far remov’d the date,"
1539,THE TRAVELLER,When commerce proudly flourish’d through the state;
1540,THE TRAVELLER,"At her command the palace learn’d to rise,                   135"
1541,THE TRAVELLER,Again the long-fall’n column sought the skies;
1542,THE TRAVELLER,"The canvas glow’d beyond e’en Nature warm,"
1543,THE TRAVELLER,The pregnant quarry teem’d with human form;
1544,THE TRAVELLER,"Till, more unsteady than the southern gale,"
1545,THE TRAVELLER,Commerce on other shores display’d her sail;                 140
1546,THE TRAVELLER,"While nought remain’d of all that riches gave,"
1547,THE TRAVELLER,"But towns unmann’d, and lords without a slave;"
1548,THE TRAVELLER,"And late the nation found, with fruitless skill,"
1549,THE TRAVELLER,Its former strength was but plethoric ill.
1550,THE TRAVELLER,
1551,THE TRAVELLER,Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied              145
1552,THE TRAVELLER,"By arts, the splendid wrecks of former pride;"
1553,THE TRAVELLER,From these the feeble heart and long-fall’n mind
1554,THE TRAVELLER,An easy compensation seem to find.
1555,THE TRAVELLER,"Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array’d,"
1556,THE TRAVELLER,The paste-board triumph and the cavalcade;                   150
1557,THE TRAVELLER,"Processions form’d for piety and love,"
1558,THE TRAVELLER,A mistress or a saint in every grove.
1559,THE TRAVELLER,"By sports like these are all their cares beguil’d,"
1560,THE TRAVELLER,The sports of children satisfy the child;
1561,THE TRAVELLER,"Each nobler aim, repress’d by long control,                  155"
1562,THE TRAVELLER,"Now sinks at last, or feebly mans the soul;"
1563,THE TRAVELLER,"While low delights, succeeding fast behind,"
1564,THE TRAVELLER,In happier meanness occupy the mind:
1565,THE TRAVELLER,"As in those domes, where Caesars once bore sway,"
1566,THE TRAVELLER,"Defac’d by time and tottering in decay,                      160"
1567,THE TRAVELLER,"There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,"
1568,THE TRAVELLER,"The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed,"
1569,THE TRAVELLER,"And, wond’ring man could want the larger pile,"
1570,THE TRAVELLER,"Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile."
1571,THE TRAVELLER,
1572,THE TRAVELLER,"My soul, turn from them; turn we to survey                 165"
1573,THE TRAVELLER,"Where rougher climes a nobler race display,"
1574,THE TRAVELLER,"Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread,"
1575,THE TRAVELLER,And force a churlish soil for scanty bread;
1576,THE TRAVELLER,"No product here the barren hills afford,"
1577,THE TRAVELLER,"But man and steel, the soldier and his sword;                170"
1578,THE TRAVELLER,"No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,"
1579,THE TRAVELLER,But winter ling’ring chills the lap of May;
1580,THE TRAVELLER,"No Zephyr fondly sues the mountain’s breast,"
1581,THE TRAVELLER,"But meteors glare, and stormy glooms invest."
1582,THE TRAVELLER,
1583,THE TRAVELLER,"Yet still, e’en here, content can spread a charm,          175"
1584,THE TRAVELLER,"Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm."
1585,THE TRAVELLER,"Though poor the peasant’s hut, his feasts though small,"
1586,THE TRAVELLER,He sees his little lot the lot of all;
1587,THE TRAVELLER,Sees no contiguous palace rear its head
1588,THE TRAVELLER,To shame the meanness of his humble shed;                    180
1589,THE TRAVELLER,No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal
1590,THE TRAVELLER,To make him loathe his vegetable meal;
1591,THE TRAVELLER,"But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,"
1592,THE TRAVELLER,"Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil."
1593,THE TRAVELLER,"Cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose,                 185"
1594,THE TRAVELLER,"Breasts the keen air, and carols as he goes;"
1595,THE TRAVELLER,"With patient angle trolls the finny deep,"
1596,THE TRAVELLER,Or drives his vent’rous plough-share to the steep;
1597,THE TRAVELLER,"Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way,"
1598,THE TRAVELLER,And drags the struggling savage into day.                    190
1599,THE TRAVELLER,"At night returning, every labour sped,"
1600,THE TRAVELLER,He sits him down the monarch of a shed;
1601,THE TRAVELLER,"Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys"
1602,THE TRAVELLER,"His children’s looks, that brighten at the blaze;"
1603,THE TRAVELLER,"While his lov’d partner, boastful of her hoard,              195"
1604,THE TRAVELLER,Displays her cleanly platter on the board:
1605,THE TRAVELLER,"And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,"
1606,THE TRAVELLER,With many a tale repays the nightly bed.
1607,THE TRAVELLER,
1608,THE TRAVELLER,"Thus every good his native wilds impart,"
1609,THE TRAVELLER,"Imprints the patriot passion on his heart,                   200"
1610,THE TRAVELLER,"And e’en those ills, that round his mansion rise,"
1611,THE TRAVELLER,Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies.
1612,THE TRAVELLER,"Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,"
1613,THE TRAVELLER,And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms;
1614,THE TRAVELLER,"And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,                  205"
1615,THE TRAVELLER,"Clings close and closer to the mother’s breast,"
1616,THE TRAVELLER,"So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind’s roar,"
1617,THE TRAVELLER,But bind him to his native mountains more.
1618,THE TRAVELLER,
1619,THE TRAVELLER,Such are the charms to barren states assign’d;
1620,THE TRAVELLER,"Their wants but few, their wishes all confin’d.              210"
1621,THE TRAVELLER,"Yet let them only share the praises due,"
1622,THE TRAVELLER,"If few their wants, their pleasures are but few;"
1623,THE TRAVELLER,"For every want that stimulates the breast,"
1624,THE TRAVELLER,Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest.
1625,THE TRAVELLER,"Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies,          215"
1626,THE TRAVELLER,"That first excites desire, and then supplies;"
1627,THE TRAVELLER,"Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,"
1628,THE TRAVELLER,To fill the languid pause with finer joy;
1629,THE TRAVELLER,"Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame,"
1630,THE TRAVELLER,"Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame.            220"
1631,THE TRAVELLER,"Their level life is but a smould’ring fire,"
1632,THE TRAVELLER,"Unquench’d by want, unfann’d by strong desire;"
1633,THE TRAVELLER,"Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer"
1634,THE TRAVELLER,"On some high festival of once a year,"
1635,THE TRAVELLER,"In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,                 225"
1636,THE TRAVELLER,"Till, buried in debauch, the bliss expire."
1637,THE TRAVELLER,
1638,THE TRAVELLER,But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow:
1639,THE TRAVELLER,"Their morals, like their pleasures, are but low;"
1640,THE TRAVELLER,"For, as refinement stops, from sire to son"
1641,THE TRAVELLER,"Unalter’d, unimprov’d the manners run;                       230"
1642,THE TRAVELLER,And love’s and friendship’s finely pointed dart
1643,THE TRAVELLER,Fall blunted from each indurated heart.
1644,THE TRAVELLER,Some sterner virtues o’er the mountain’s breast
1645,THE TRAVELLER,"May sit, like falcons cow’ring on the nest;"
1646,THE TRAVELLER,"But all the gentler morals, such as play                     235"
1647,THE TRAVELLER,"Through life’s more cultur’d walks, and charm the way,"
1648,THE TRAVELLER,"These far dispers’d, on timorous pinions fly,"
1649,THE TRAVELLER,To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.
1650,THE TRAVELLER,
1651,THE TRAVELLER,"To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,"
1652,THE TRAVELLER,I turn; and France displays her bright domain.               240
1653,THE TRAVELLER,"Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease,"
1654,THE TRAVELLER,"Pleas’d with thyself, whom all the world can please,"
1655,THE TRAVELLER,"How often have I led thy sportive choir,"
1656,THE TRAVELLER,"With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire!"
1657,THE TRAVELLER,"Where shading elms along the margin grew,                    245"
1658,THE TRAVELLER,And freshen’d from the wave the Zephyr flew;
1659,THE TRAVELLER,"And haply, though my harsh touch falt’ring still,"
1660,THE TRAVELLER,"But mock’d all tune, and marr’d the dancer’s skill;"
1661,THE TRAVELLER,"Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,"
1662,THE TRAVELLER,"And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.                  250"
1663,THE TRAVELLER,Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days
1664,THE TRAVELLER,"Have led their children through the mirthful maze,"
1665,THE TRAVELLER,"And the gay grandsire, skill’d in gestic lore,"
1666,THE TRAVELLER,Has frisk’d beneath the burthen of threescore.
1667,THE TRAVELLER,
1668,THE TRAVELLER,"So bless’d a life these thoughtless realms display,        255"
1669,THE TRAVELLER,Thus idly busy rolls their world away:
1670,THE TRAVELLER,"Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,"
1671,THE TRAVELLER,For honour forms the social temper here:
1672,THE TRAVELLER,"Honour, that praise which real merit gains,"
1673,THE TRAVELLER,"Or e’en imaginary worth obtains,                             260"
1674,THE TRAVELLER,"Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,"
1675,THE TRAVELLER,It shifts in splendid traffic round the land:
1676,THE TRAVELLER,"From courts, to camps, to cottages it strays,"
1677,THE TRAVELLER,And all are taught an avarice of praise;
1678,THE TRAVELLER,"They please, are pleas’d, they give to get esteem,           265"
1679,THE TRAVELLER,"Till, seeming bless’d, they grow to what they seem."
1680,THE TRAVELLER,
1681,THE TRAVELLER,"But while this softer art their bliss supplies,"
1682,THE TRAVELLER,It gives their follies also room to rise;
1683,THE TRAVELLER,"For praise too dearly lov’d, or warmly sought,"
1684,THE TRAVELLER,Enfeebles all internal strength of thought;                  270
1685,THE TRAVELLER,"And the weak soul, within itself unblest,"
1686,THE TRAVELLER,Leans for all pleasure on another’s breast.
1687,THE TRAVELLER,"Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,"
1688,THE TRAVELLER,Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;
1689,THE TRAVELLER,"Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,                        275"
1690,THE TRAVELLER,And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace;
1691,THE TRAVELLER,"Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,"
1692,THE TRAVELLER,To boast one splendid banquet once a year;
1693,THE TRAVELLER,"The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,"
1694,THE TRAVELLER,Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause.                 280
1695,THE TRAVELLER,
1696,THE TRAVELLER,"To men of other minds my fancy flies,"
1697,THE TRAVELLER,Embosom’d in the deep where Holland lies.
1698,THE TRAVELLER,"Methinks her patient sons before me stand,"
1699,THE TRAVELLER,"Where the broad ocean leans against the land,"
1700,THE TRAVELLER,"And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,                       285"
1701,THE TRAVELLER,Lift the tall rampire’s artificial pride.
1702,THE TRAVELLER,"Onward, methinks, and diligently slow,"
1703,THE TRAVELLER,The firm-connected bulwark seems to grow;
1704,THE TRAVELLER,"Spreads its long arms amidst the wat’ry roar,"
1705,THE TRAVELLER,"Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore;                  290"
1706,THE TRAVELLER,"While the pent ocean rising o’er the pile,"
1707,THE TRAVELLER,Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile;
1708,THE TRAVELLER,"The slow canal, the yellow-blossom’d vale,"
1709,THE TRAVELLER,"The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,"
1710,THE TRAVELLER,"The crowded mart, the cultivated plain,                      295"
1711,THE TRAVELLER,A new creation rescu’d from his reign.
1712,THE TRAVELLER,
1713,THE TRAVELLER,"Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil"
1714,THE TRAVELLER,"Impels the native to repeated toil,"
1715,THE TRAVELLER,"Industrious habits in each bosom reign,"
1716,THE TRAVELLER,And industry begets a love of gain.                          300
1717,THE TRAVELLER,"Hence all the good from opulence that springs,"
1718,THE TRAVELLER,"With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,"
1719,THE TRAVELLER,Are here displayed. Their much-lov’d wealth imparts
1720,THE TRAVELLER,"Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;"
1721,THE TRAVELLER,"But view them closer, craft and fraud appear,                305"
1722,THE TRAVELLER,E’en liberty itself is barter’d here.
1723,THE TRAVELLER,"At gold’s superior charms all freedom flies,"
1724,THE TRAVELLER,"The needy sell it, and the rich man buys;"
1725,THE TRAVELLER,"A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,"
1726,THE TRAVELLER,"Here wretches seek dishonourable graves,                     310"
1727,THE TRAVELLER,"And calmly bent, to servitude conform,"
1728,THE TRAVELLER,Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm.
1729,THE TRAVELLER,
1730,THE TRAVELLER,Heavens! how unlike their Belgic sires of old!
1731,THE TRAVELLER,"Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold;"
1732,THE TRAVELLER,"War in each breast, and freedom on each brow;                315"
1733,THE TRAVELLER,How much unlike the sons of Britain now!
1734,THE TRAVELLER,
1735,THE TRAVELLER,"Fir’d at the sound, my genius spreads her wing,"
1736,THE TRAVELLER,And flies where Britain courts the western spring;
1737,THE TRAVELLER,"Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride,"
1738,THE TRAVELLER,And brighter streams than fam’d Hydaspes glide.              320
1739,THE TRAVELLER,"There all around the gentlest breezes stray,"
1740,THE TRAVELLER,There gentle music melts on ev’ry spray;
1741,THE TRAVELLER,"Creation’s mildest charms are there combin’d,"
1742,THE TRAVELLER,Extremes are only in the master’s mind!
1743,THE TRAVELLER,"Stern o’er each bosom reason holds her state,                325"
1744,THE TRAVELLER,With daring aims irregularly great;
1745,THE TRAVELLER,"Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,"
1746,THE TRAVELLER,"I see the lords of human kind pass by,"
1747,THE TRAVELLER,"Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,"
1748,THE TRAVELLER,"By forms unfashion’d, fresh from Nature’s hand;              330"
1749,THE TRAVELLER,"Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,"
1750,THE TRAVELLER,"True to imagin’d right, above control,"
1751,THE TRAVELLER,"While e’en the peasant boasts these rights to scan,"
1752,THE TRAVELLER,And learns to venerate himself as man.
1753,THE TRAVELLER,
1754,THE TRAVELLER,"Thine, Freedom, thine the blessings pictur’d here,         335"
1755,THE TRAVELLER,Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;
1756,THE TRAVELLER,"Too bless’d, indeed, were such without alloy,"
1757,THE TRAVELLER,"But foster’d e’en by Freedom, ills annoy:"
1758,THE TRAVELLER,"That independence Britons prize too high,"
1759,THE TRAVELLER,"Keeps man from man, and breaks the social tie;               340"
1760,THE TRAVELLER,"The self-dependent lordlings stand alone,"
1761,THE TRAVELLER,All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown;
1762,THE TRAVELLER,"Here by the bonds of nature feebly held,"
1763,THE TRAVELLER,"Minds combat minds, repelling and repell’d."
1764,THE TRAVELLER,"Ferments arise, imprison’d factions roar,                    345"
1765,THE TRAVELLER,"Repress’d ambition struggles round her shore,"
1766,THE TRAVELLER,"Till over-wrought, the general system feels"
1767,THE TRAVELLER,"Its motions stop, or frenzy fire the wheels."
1768,THE TRAVELLER,
1769,THE TRAVELLER,"Nor this the worst. As nature’s ties decay,"
1770,THE TRAVELLER,"As duty, love, and honour fail to sway,                      350"
1771,THE TRAVELLER,"Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,"
1772,THE TRAVELLER,"Still gather strength, and force unwilling awe."
1773,THE TRAVELLER,"Hence all obedience bows to these alone,"
1774,THE TRAVELLER,"And talent sinks, and merit weeps unknown;"
1775,THE TRAVELLER,"Time may come, when stripp’d of all her charms,              355"
1776,THE TRAVELLER,"The land of scholars, and the nurse of arms,"
1777,THE TRAVELLER,"Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame,"
1778,THE TRAVELLER,"Where kings have toil’d, and poets wrote for fame,"
1779,THE TRAVELLER,"One sink of level avarice shall lie,"
1780,THE TRAVELLER,"And scholars, soldiers, kings, unhonour’d die.               360"
1781,THE TRAVELLER,
1782,THE TRAVELLER,"Yet think not, thus when Freedom’s ills I state,"
1783,THE TRAVELLER,"I mean to flatter kings, or court the great;"
1784,THE TRAVELLER,"Ye powers of truth, that bid my soul aspire,"
1785,THE TRAVELLER,Far from my bosom drive the low desire;
1786,THE TRAVELLER,"And thou, fair Freedom, taught alike to feel                 365"
1787,THE TRAVELLER,"The rabble’s rage, and tyrant’s angry steel;"
1788,THE TRAVELLER,"Thou transitory flower, alike undone"
1789,THE TRAVELLER,"By proud contempt, or favour’s fostering sun,"
1790,THE TRAVELLER,"Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure,"
1791,THE TRAVELLER,I only would repress them to secure:                         370
1792,THE TRAVELLER,"For just experience tells, in every soil,"
1793,THE TRAVELLER,That those who think must govern those that toil;
1794,THE TRAVELLER,"And all that freedom’s highest aims can reach,"
1795,THE TRAVELLER,Is but to lay proportion’d loads on each.
1796,THE TRAVELLER,"Hence, should one order disproportion’d grow,                375"
1797,THE TRAVELLER,Its double weight must ruin all below.
1798,THE TRAVELLER,
1799,THE TRAVELLER,"O then how blind to all that truth requires,"
1800,THE TRAVELLER,Who think it freedom when a part aspires!
1801,THE TRAVELLER,"Calm is my soul, nor apt to rise in arms,"
1802,THE TRAVELLER,Except when fast-approaching danger warms:                   380
1803,THE TRAVELLER,"But when contending chiefs blockade the throne,"
1804,THE TRAVELLER,Contracting regal power to stretch their own;
1805,THE TRAVELLER,When I behold a factious band agree
1806,THE TRAVELLER,To call it freedom when themselves are free;
1807,THE TRAVELLER,"Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw,                   385"
1808,THE TRAVELLER,"Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law;"
1809,THE TRAVELLER,"The wealth of climes, where savage nations roam,"
1810,THE TRAVELLER,Pillag’d from slaves to purchase slaves at home;
1811,THE TRAVELLER,"Fear, pity, justice, indignation start,"
1812,THE TRAVELLER,"Tear off reserve, and bare my swelling heart;                390"
1813,THE TRAVELLER,"Till half a patriot, half a coward grown,"
1814,THE TRAVELLER,I fly from petty tyrants to the throne.
1815,THE TRAVELLER,
1816,THE TRAVELLER,"Yes, brother, curse with me that baleful hour,"
1817,THE TRAVELLER,When first ambition struck at regal power;
1818,THE TRAVELLER,"And thus polluting honour in its source,                     395"
1819,THE TRAVELLER,Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force.
1820,THE TRAVELLER,"Have we not seen, round Britain’s peopled shore,"
1821,THE TRAVELLER,Her useful sons exchang’d for useless ore?
1822,THE TRAVELLER,"Seen all her triumphs but destruction haste,"
1823,THE TRAVELLER,Like flaring tapers bright’ning as they waste;               400
1824,THE TRAVELLER,"Seen opulence, her grandeur to maintain,"
1825,THE TRAVELLER,"Lead stern depopulation in her train,"
1826,THE TRAVELLER,"And over fields where scatter’d hamlets rose,"
1827,THE TRAVELLER,In barren solitary pomp repose?
1828,THE TRAVELLER,"Have we not seen, at pleasure’s lordly call,                 405"
1829,THE TRAVELLER,The smiling long-frequented village fall?
1830,THE TRAVELLER,"Beheld the duteous son, the sire decay’d,"
1831,THE TRAVELLER,"The modest matron, and the blushing maid,"
1832,THE TRAVELLER,"Forc’d from their homes, a melancholy train,"
1833,THE TRAVELLER,To traverse climes beyond the western main;                  410
1834,THE TRAVELLER,"Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around,"
1835,THE TRAVELLER,And Niagara stuns with thund’ring sound?
1836,THE TRAVELLER,
1837,THE TRAVELLER,"E’en now, perhaps as there some pilgrim strays"
1838,THE TRAVELLER,"Through tangled forests, and through dangerous ways;"
1839,THE TRAVELLER,"Where beasts with man divided empire claim,                  415"
1840,THE TRAVELLER,And the brown Indian marks with murd’rous aim;
1841,THE TRAVELLER,"There, while above the giddy tempest flies,"
1842,THE TRAVELLER,"And all around distressful yells arise,"
1843,THE TRAVELLER,"The pensive exile, bending with his woe,"
1844,THE TRAVELLER,"To stop too fearful, and too faint to go,                    420"
1845,THE TRAVELLER,"Casts a long look where England’s glories shine,"
1846,THE TRAVELLER,And bids his bosom sympathise with mine.
1847,THE TRAVELLER,
1848,THE TRAVELLER,"Vain, very vain, my weary search to find"
1849,THE TRAVELLER,That bliss which only centres in the mind:
1850,THE TRAVELLER,"Why have I stray’d from pleasure and repose,                 425"
1851,THE TRAVELLER,To seek a good each government bestows?
1852,THE TRAVELLER,"In every government, though terrors reign,"
1853,THE TRAVELLER,"Though tyrant kings, or tyrant laws restrain,"
1854,THE TRAVELLER,"How small, of all that human hearts endure,"
1855,THE TRAVELLER,That part which laws or kings can cause or cure.             430
1856,THE TRAVELLER,"Still to ourselves in every place consign’d,"
1857,THE TRAVELLER,Our own felicity we make or find:
1858,THE TRAVELLER,"With secret course, which no loud storms annoy,"
1859,THE TRAVELLER,Glides the smooth current of domestic joy.
1860,THE TRAVELLER,"The lifted axe, the agonising wheel,                         435"
1861,THE TRAVELLER,"Luke’s iron crown, and Damiens’ bed of steel,"
1862,THE TRAVELLER,"To men remote from power but rarely known,"
1863,THE TRAVELLER,"Leave reason, faith, and conscience all our own."

1883,TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS,
1884,"DEAR SIR,","DEAR SIR,"
1885,"DEAR SIR,",I can have no expectations in
1886,"DEAR SIR,","an address of this kind, either to add to your reputation, or to establish"
1887,"DEAR SIR,","my own. You can gain nothing from my admiration, as I am ignorant of that"
1888,"DEAR SIR,",art in which you are said to excel; and I may lose much by the severity of
1889,"DEAR SIR,","your judgment, as few have a juster taste in poetry than you. Setting"
1890,"DEAR SIR,","interest therefore aside, to which I never paid much attention, I must be"
1891,"DEAR SIR,",indulged at present in following my affections. The only dedication I ever
1892,"DEAR SIR,","made was to my brother, because I loved him better than most other men. He"
1893,"DEAR SIR,",is since dead. Permit me to inscribe this Poem to you.
1894,"DEAR SIR,",
1895,"DEAR SIR,",How far you may be pleased with the versification and mere mechanical
1896,"DEAR SIR,","parts of this attempt, I don’t pretend to enquire; but I know you will"
1897,"DEAR SIR,",object (and indeed several of our best and wisest friends concur in the
1898,"DEAR SIR,","opinion) that the depopulation it deplores is no where to be seen, and the"
1899,"DEAR SIR,",disorders it laments are only to be found in the poet’s own imagination.
1900,"DEAR SIR,",To this I can scarce make any other answer than that I sincerely believe
1901,"DEAR SIR,","what I have written; that I have taken all possible pains, in my country"
1902,"DEAR SIR,","excursions, for these four or five years past, to be certain of what I"
1903,"DEAR SIR,",allege; and that all my views and enquiries have led me to believe those
1904,"DEAR SIR,","miseries real, which I here attempt to display. But this is not the place"
1905,"DEAR SIR,","to enter into an enquiry, whether the country be depopulating or not; the"
1906,"DEAR SIR,","discussion would take up much room, and I should prove myself, at best, an"
1907,"DEAR SIR,","indifferent politician, to tire the reader with a long preface, when I"
1908,"DEAR SIR,",want his unfatigued attention to a long poem.
1909,"DEAR SIR,",
1910,"DEAR SIR,","In regretting the depopulation of the country, I inveigh against the"
1911,"DEAR SIR,",increase of our luxuries; and here also I expect the shout of modern
1912,"DEAR SIR,","politicians against me. For twenty or thirty years past, it has been the"
1913,"DEAR SIR,",fashion to consider luxury as one of the greatest national advantages; and
1914,"DEAR SIR,","all the wisdom of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous. Still"
1915,"DEAR SIR,","however, I must remain a professed ancient on that head, and continue to"
1916,"DEAR SIR,","think those luxuries prejudicial to states, by which so many vices are"
1917,"DEAR SIR,","introduced, and so many kingdoms have been undone. Indeed so much has been"
1918,"DEAR SIR,","poured out of late on the other side of the question, that, merely for the"
1919,"DEAR SIR,","sake of novelty and variety, one would sometimes wish to be in the right."
1920,"DEAR SIR,",
1921,"DEAR SIR,","I am, Dear Sir,"
1922,"DEAR SIR,",
1923,"DEAR SIR,","Your sincere friend, and ardent admirer,"

1938,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"SWEET AUBURN! loveliest village of the plain,"
1939,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where health and plenty cheer’d the labouring swain,"
1940,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,"
1941,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And parting summer’s lingering blooms delay’d:
1942,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,                      5"
1943,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Seats of my youth, when every sport could please,"
1944,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"How often have I loiter’d o’er thy green,"
1945,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where humble happiness endear’d each scene;
1946,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"How often have I paus’d on every charm,"
1947,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The shelter’d cot, the cultivated farm,                       10"
1948,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The never-failing brook, the busy mill,"
1949,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The decent church that topp’d the neighbouring hill,"
1950,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,"
1951,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,For talking age and whisp’ring lovers made;
1952,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"How often have I bless’d the coming day,                      15"
1953,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When toil remitting lent its turn to play,"
1954,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And all the village train, from labour free,"
1955,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree;
1956,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While many a pastime circled in the shade,"
1957,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The young contending as the old survey’d;                     20
1958,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And many a gambol frolick’d o’er the ground,"
1959,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And sleights of art and feats of strength went round;
1960,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And still as each repeated pleasure tir’d,"
1961,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspir’d;
1962,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The dancing pair that simply sought renown,                   25"
1963,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,By holding out to tire each other down;
1964,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,"
1965,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,While secret laughter titter’d round the place;
1966,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The bashful virgin’s side-long looks of love,"
1967,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The matron’s glance that would those looks reprove:           30
1968,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"These were thy charms, sweet village; sports like these,"
1969,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With sweet succession, taught e’en toil to please;"
1970,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,"
1971,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,These were thy charms—But all these charms are fled.
1972,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1973,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,               35"
1974,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;"
1975,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Amidst thy bowers the tyrant’s hand is seen,"
1976,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And desolation saddens all thy green:
1977,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"One only master grasps the whole domain,"
1978,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain:                  40
1979,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,"
1980,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But chok’d with sedges, works its weedy way."
1981,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Along thy glades, a solitary guest,"
1982,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;
1983,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,                    45"
1984,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And tires their echoes with unvaried cries.
1985,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,"
1986,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And the long grass o’ertops the mould’ring wall;
1987,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And trembling, shrinking from the spoiler’s hand,"
1988,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Far, far away, thy children leave the land.                   50"
1989,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1990,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Ill fares the land, to hast’ning ills a prey,"
1991,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:"
1992,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;"
1993,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"A breath can make them, as a breath has made;"
1994,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But a bold peasantry, their country’s pride,                  55"
1995,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When once destroy’d, can never be supplied."
1996,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1997,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"A time there was, ere England’s griefs began,"
1998,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,When every rood of ground maintain’d its man;
1999,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"For him light labour spread her wholesome store,"
2000,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Just gave what life requir’d, but gave no more:               60"
2001,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"His best companions, innocence and health;"
2002,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And his best riches, ignorance of wealth."
2003,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2004,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,But times are alter’d; trade’s unfeeling train
2005,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Usurp the land and dispossess the swain;
2006,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Along the lawn, where scatter’d hamlets rose,                 65"
2007,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Unwieldy wealth, and cumbrous pomp repose;"
2008,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And every want to opulence allied,"
2009,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And every pang that folly pays to pride.
2010,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,"
2011,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those calm desires that ask’d but little room,                70"
2012,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those healthful sports that grac’d the peaceful scene,"
2013,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Liv’d in each look, and brighten’d all the green;"
2014,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"These, far departing, seek a kinder shore,"
2015,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And rural mirth and manners are no more.
2016,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2017,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Sweet AUBURN!  parent of the blissful hour,                 75"
2018,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant’s power.
2019,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here as I take my solitary rounds,"
2020,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Amidst thy tangling walks, and ruin’d grounds,"
2021,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, many a year elaps’d, return to view"
2022,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,              80"
2023,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,"
2024,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain."
2025,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2026,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"In all my wand’rings round this world of care,"
2027,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In all my griefs—and GOD has given my share—
2028,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,                   85"
2029,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;
2030,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To husband out life’s taper at the close,"
2031,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And keep the flame from wasting by repose.
2032,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,"
2033,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Amidst the swains to show my book-learn’d skill,              90"
2034,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Around my fire an evening group to draw,"
2035,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;"
2036,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,"
2037,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,"
2038,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"I still had hopes, my long vexations pass’d,                  95"
2039,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Here to return—and die at home at last.
2040,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2041,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"O blest retirement, friend to life’s decline,"
2042,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Retreats from care, that never must be mine,"
2043,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"How happy he who crowns in shades like these,"
2044,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,A youth of labour with an age of ease;                       100
2045,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Who quits a world where strong temptations try
2046,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, since ’tis hard to combat, learns to fly!"
2047,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"For him no wretches, born to work and weep,"
2048,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;"
2049,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,No surly porter stands in guilty state                       105
2050,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To spurn imploring famine from the gate;
2051,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But on he moves to meet his latter end,"
2052,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Angels around befriending Virtue’s friend;
2053,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Bends to the grave with unperceiv’d decay,"
2054,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,While Resignation gently slopes the way;                     110
2055,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, all his prospects bright’ning to the last,"
2056,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,His Heaven commences ere the world be pass’d!

2064,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening’s close"
2065,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;
2066,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"There, as I pass’d with careless steps and slow,             115"
2067,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The mingling notes came soften’d from below;
2068,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,"
2069,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The sober herd that low’d to meet their young;
2070,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The noisy geese that gabbled o’er the pool,"
2071,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The playful children just let loose from school;             120
2072,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The watchdog’s voice that bay’d the whisp’ring wind,"
2073,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;
2074,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,"
2075,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And fill’d each pause the nightingale had made.
2076,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But now the sounds of population fail,                       125"
2077,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,"
2078,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread,"
2079,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,For all the bloomy flush of life is fled.
2080,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"All but yon widow’d, solitary thing"

2082,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"She, wretched matron, forc’d in age, for bread,"
2083,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,"
2084,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,"
2085,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;"
2086,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"She only left of all the harmless train,                     135"
2087,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The sad historian of the pensive plain.
2088,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2089,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Near yonder copse, where once the garden smil’d,"
2090,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And still where many a garden flower grows wild;
2091,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,"
2092,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The village preacher’s modest mansion rose.                  140
2093,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"A man he was to all the country dear,"
2094,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And passing rich with forty pounds a year;
2095,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Remote from towns he ran his godly race,"
2096,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Nor e’er had chang’d, nor wished to change his place;"
2097,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Unpractis’d he to fawn, or seek for power,                   145"
2098,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,By doctrines fashion’d to the varying hour;
2099,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,"
2100,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,More skill’d to raise the wretched than to rise.
2101,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"His house was known to all the vagrant train,"
2102,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"He chid their wand’rings, but reliev’d their pain;           150"
2103,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The long-remember’d beggar was his guest,"
2104,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;
2105,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The ruin’d spendthrift, now no longer proud,"
2106,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Claim’d kindred there, and had his claims allow’d;"
2107,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,                     155"
2108,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Sat by his fire, and talk’d the night away;"
2109,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Wept o’er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,"
2110,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Shoulder’d his crutch, and show’d how fields were won."
2111,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Pleas’d with his guests, the good man learn’d to glow,"
2112,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And quite forgot their vices in their woe;                   160
2113,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Careless their merits, or their faults to scan,"
2114,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,His pity gave ere charity began.
2115,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2116,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,"
2117,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And e’en his failings lean’d to Virtue’s side;
2118,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But in his duty prompt at every call,                        165"
2119,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"He watch’d and wept, he pray’d and felt, for all."
2120,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, as a bird each fond endearment tries"
2121,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To tempt its new-fledg’d offspring to the skies,"
2122,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"He tried each art, reprov’d each dull delay,"
2123,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Allur’d to brighter worlds, and led the way.                 170"
2124,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2125,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Beside the bed where parting life was laid,"
2126,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay’d,"
2127,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The reverend champion stood. At his control,"
2128,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
2129,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,             175"
2130,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And his last falt’ring accents whisper’d praise.
2131,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2132,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"At church, with meek and unaffected grace,"
2133,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,His looks adorn’d the venerable place;
2134,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Truth from his lips prevail’d with double sway,"
2135,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And fools, who came to scoff, remain’d to pray.              180"
2136,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The service pass’d, around the pious man,"
2137,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;"
2138,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Even children follow’d with endearing wile,"
2139,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And pluck’d his gown, to share the good man’s smile."
2140,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"His ready smile a parent’s warmth express’d,                 185"
2141,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Their welfare pleas’d him, and their cares distress’d;"
2142,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,"
2143,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.
2144,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,"
2145,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,           190"
2146,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,"
2147,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
2148,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2149,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,"
2150,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With blossom’d furze unprofitably gay,"
2151,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"There, in his noisy mansion, skill’d to rule,                195"
2152,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The village master taught his little school;
2153,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"A man severe he was, and stern to view;"
2154,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"I knew him well, and every truant knew;"
2155,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Well had the boding tremblers learn’d to trace
2156,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The day’s disasters in his morning face;                     200
2157,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Full well they laugh’d, with counterfeited glee,"
2158,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;"
2159,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Full well the busy whisper, circling round,"
2160,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Convey’d the dismal tidings when he frown’d;
2161,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Yet he was kind; or if severe in aught,                      205"
2162,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The love he bore to learning was in fault;
2163,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The village all declar’d how much he knew;
2164,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"’Twas certain he could write, and cypher too;"
2165,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,"
2166,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And e’en the story ran that he could gauge.                  210
2167,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"In arguing too, the parson own’d his skill,"
2168,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"For e’en though vanquish’d, he could argue still;"
2169,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,While words of learned length and thund’ring sound
2170,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Amazed the gazing rustics rang’d around,"
2171,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And still they gaz’d, and still the wonder grew,             215"
2172,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,That one small head could carry all he knew.
2173,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2174,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,But past is all his fame. The very spot
2175,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where many a time he triumph’d, is forgot."
2176,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,"
2177,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,             220"
2178,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspir’d,"
2179,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retir’d,"
2180,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where village statesmen talk’d with looks profound,"
2181,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And news much older than their ale went round.
2182,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Imagination fondly stoops to trace                           225
2183,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The parlour splendours of that festive place;
2184,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The white-wash’d wall, the nicely sanded floor,"
2185,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The varnish’d clock that click’d behind the door;
2186,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The chest contriv’d a double debt to pay,"
2187,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;                   230"
2188,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The pictures plac’d for ornament and use,"
2189,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;"
2190,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The hearth, except when winter chill’d the day,"
2191,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;"
2192,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,                 235"
2193,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Rang’d o’er the chimney, glisten’d in a row."
2194,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2195,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Vain, transitory splendours! Could not all"
2196,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall!
2197,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart"
2198,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,An hour’s importance to the poor man’s heart;                240
2199,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Thither no more the peasant shall repair
2200,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To sweet oblivion of his daily care;
2201,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No more the farmer’s news, the barber’s tale,"
2202,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,No more the wood-man’s ballad shall prevail;
2203,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No more the smith his dusky brown shall clear,               245"
2204,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Relax his pond’rous strength, and lean to hear;"
2205,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The host himself no longer shall be found
2206,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;
2207,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Nor the coy maid, half willing to be press’d,"
2208,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.                   250
2209,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2210,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,"
2211,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,These simple blessings of the lowly train;
2212,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To me more dear, congenial to my heart,"
2213,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"One native charm, than all the gloss of art;"
2214,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,                 255"
2215,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;"
2216,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Lightly they frolic o’er the vacant mind,"
2217,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Unenvied, unmolested, unconfin’d:"
2218,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,"
2219,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With all the freaks of wanton wealth array’d,                260"
2220,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,"
2221,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;
2222,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, e’en while fashion’s brightest arts decoy,"
2223,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy."
2224,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2225,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey              265"
2226,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The rich man’s joys increase, the poor’s decay,"
2227,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"’Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand"
2228,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Between a splendid and a happy land.
2229,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,"
2230,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;                270
2231,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Hoards, e’en beyond the miser’s wish abound,"
2232,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And rich men flock from all the world around.
2233,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name
2234,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,That leaves our useful products still the same.
2235,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Nor so the loss. The man of wealth and pride                 275
2236,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
2237,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Space for his lake, his park’s extended bounds,"
2238,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;"
2239,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
2240,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Has robb’d the neighbouring fields of half their growth,     280"
2241,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"His seat, where solitary sports are seen,"
2242,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;
2243,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Around the world each needful product flies,"
2244,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,For all the luxuries the world supplies:
2245,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While thus the land adorn’d for pleasure, all                285"
2246,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.
2247,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2248,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"As some fair female unadorn’d and plain,"
2249,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,"
2250,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Slights every borrow’d charm that dress supplies,"
2251,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes:                 290
2252,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But when those charms are pass’d, for charms are frail,"
2253,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When time advances, and when lovers fail,"
2254,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,"
2255,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In all the glaring impotence of dress.
2256,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Thus fares the land, by luxury betray’d,                     295"
2257,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In nature’s simplest charms at first array’d;
2258,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But verging to decline, its splendours rise,"
2259,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;"
2260,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While scourg’d by famine from the smiling land,"
2261,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The mournful peasant leads his humble band;                  300
2262,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And while he sinks, without one arm to save,"
2263,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The country blooms—a garden, and a grave."
2264,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2265,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where then, ah! where, shall poverty reside,"
2266,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To ’scape the pressure of continuous pride?
2267,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"If to some common’s fenceless limits stray’d,                305"
2268,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,"
2269,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,"
2270,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And e’en the bare-worn common is denied.
2271,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2272,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,If to the city sped—What waits him there?
2273,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To see profusion that he must not share;                     310
2274,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To see ten thousand baneful arts combin’d
2275,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;"
2276,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To see those joys the sons of pleasure know
2277,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Extorted from his fellow creature’s woe.
2278,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here, while the courtier glitters in brocade,                315"
2279,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;
2280,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here, while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,"
2281,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,There the black gibbet glooms beside the way.
2282,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign
2283,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here, richly deck’d, admits the gorgeous train;              320"
2284,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,"
2285,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare."
2286,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Sure scenes like these no troubles e’er annoy!
2287,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Sure these denote one universal joy!
2288,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Are these thy serious thoughts?—Ah, turn thine eyes         325"
2289,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where the poor houseless shiv’ring female lies.
2290,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"She once, perhaps, in village plenty bless’d,"
2291,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Has wept at tales of innocence distress’d;
2292,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,"
2293,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;               330
2294,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,"
2295,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Near her betrayer’s door she lays her head,"
2296,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, pinch’d with cold, and shrinking from the shower,"
2297,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,"
2298,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When idly first, ambitious of the town,                      335"
2299,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,She left her wheel and robes of country brown.
2300,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2301,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Do thine, sweet AUBURN, thine, the loveliest train,"
2302,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?
2303,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"E’en now, perhaps by cold and hunger led,"
2304,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,At proud men’s doors they ask a little bread!                340
2305,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
2306,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene,"
2307,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where half the convex world intrudes between,"
2308,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,"
2309,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.
2310,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Far different there from all that charm’d before,            345"
2311,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The various terrors of that horrid shore;
2312,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,"
2313,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And fiercely shed intolerable day;
2314,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those matted woods where birds forget to sing,"
2315,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;                    350
2316,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those pois’nous fields with rank luxuriance crown’d,"
2317,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;
2318,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
2319,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;
2320,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,              355"
2321,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And savage men more murd’rous still than they;
2322,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,"
2323,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Mingling the ravag’d landscape with the skies.
2324,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Far different these from every former scene,"
2325,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,                  360"
2326,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The breezy covert of the warbling grove,"
2327,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,That only shelter’d thefts of harmless love.

2334,THE DEPARTURE,
2335,THE DEPARTURE,(Thomas Bewick)
2336,THE DEPARTURE,
2337,THE DEPARTURE,"Good heaven! what sorrows gloom’d that parting day,"
2338,THE DEPARTURE,That call’d them from their native walks away;
2339,THE DEPARTURE,"When the poor exiles, every pleasure pass’d,                 365"
2340,THE DEPARTURE,"Hung round their bowers, and fondly look’d their last,"
2341,THE DEPARTURE,"And took a long farewell, and wish’d in vain"
2342,THE DEPARTURE,For seats like these beyond the western main;
2343,THE DEPARTURE,"And shudd’ring still to face the distant deep,"
2344,THE DEPARTURE,"Return’d and wept, and still return’d to weep.               370"
2345,THE DEPARTURE,"The good old sire, the first prepar’d to go"
2346,THE DEPARTURE,"To new-found worlds, and wept for others’ woe;"
2347,THE DEPARTURE,"But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,"
2348,THE DEPARTURE,He only wish’d for worlds beyond the grave.
2349,THE DEPARTURE,"His lovely daughter, lovlier in her tears,                   375"
2350,THE DEPARTURE,"The fond companion of his helpless years,"
2351,THE DEPARTURE,"Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,"
2352,THE DEPARTURE,And left a lover’s for a father’s arms.
2353,THE DEPARTURE,"With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,"
2354,THE DEPARTURE,And bless’d the cot where every pleasure rose                380
2355,THE DEPARTURE,"And kiss’d her thoughtless babes with many a tear,"
2356,THE DEPARTURE,"And clasp’d them close, in sorrow doubly dear;"
2357,THE DEPARTURE,Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
2358,THE DEPARTURE,In all the silent manliness of grief.
2359,THE DEPARTURE,
2360,THE DEPARTURE,"O Luxury! thou curs’d by Heaven’s decree,                  385"
2361,THE DEPARTURE,How ill exchang’d are things like these for thee!
2362,THE DEPARTURE,"How do thy potions, with insidious joy"
2363,THE DEPARTURE,Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy!
2364,THE DEPARTURE,"Kingdoms, by thee, to sickly greatness grown,"
2365,THE DEPARTURE,Boast of a florid vigour not their own;                      390
2366,THE DEPARTURE,"At every draught more large and large they grow,"
2367,THE DEPARTURE,A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;
2368,THE DEPARTURE,"Till sapp’d their strength, and every part unsound,"
2369,THE DEPARTURE,"Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round."
2370,THE DEPARTURE,
2371,THE DEPARTURE,"E’en now the devastation is begun,                         395"
2372,THE DEPARTURE,And half the business of destruction done;
2373,THE DEPARTURE,"E’en now, methinks, as pond’ring here I stand,"
2374,THE DEPARTURE,I see the rural virtues leave the land:

2785,A TALE,Jack Book-worm led a college life;
2786,A TALE,A fellowship at twenty-five
2787,A TALE,Made him the happiest man alive;
2788,A TALE,"He drank his glass and crack’d his joke,           5"
2789,A TALE,And freshmen wonder’d as he spoke.
2790,A TALE,
2791,A TALE,"Such pleasures, unalloy’d with care,"
2792,A TALE,Could any accident impair?
2793,A TALE,Could Cupid’s shaft at length transfix
2794,A TALE,"Our swain, arriv’d at thirty-six?                 10"
2795,A TALE,O had the archer ne’er come down
2796,A TALE,To ravage in a country town!
2797,A TALE,Or Flavia been content to stop

2799,A TALE,O had her eyes forgot to blaze!                   15
2800,A TALE,Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze.
2801,A TALE,"O!——But let exclamation cease,"
2802,A TALE,Her presence banish’d all his peace.
2803,A TALE,So with decorum all things carried;
2804,A TALE,"Miss frown’d, and blush’d, and then was—married.  20"
2805,A TALE,
2806,A TALE,Need we expose to vulgar sight

2810,A TALE,"Let it suffice, that each had charms;             25"
2811,A TALE,He clasp’d a goddess in his arms;
2812,A TALE,"And though she felt his usage rough,"
2813,A TALE,Yet in a man ’twas well enough.
2814,A TALE,
2815,A TALE,"The honey-moon like lightning flew,"
2816,A TALE,The second brought its transports too.            30
2817,A TALE,"A third, a fourth, were not amiss,"
2818,A TALE,The fifth was friendship mix’d with bliss:
2819,A TALE,"But when a twelvemonth pass’d away,"
2820,A TALE,Jack found his goddess made of clay;
2821,A TALE,Found half the charms that deck’d her face        35
2822,A TALE,"Arose from powder, shreds, or lace;"
2823,A TALE,"But still the worst remain’d behind,"
2824,A TALE,That very face had robb’d her mind.
2825,A TALE,
2826,A TALE,Skill’d in no other arts was she
2827,A TALE,"But dressing, patching, repartee;                 40"
2828,A TALE,"And, just as humour rose or fell,"
2829,A TALE,By turns a slattern or a belle;
2830,A TALE,"’Tis true she dress’d with modern grace,"
2831,A TALE,Half naked at a ball or race;
2832,A TALE,"But when at home, at board or bed,                45"
2833,A TALE,Five greasy nightcaps wrapp’d her head.
2834,A TALE,Could so much beauty condescend

2838,A TALE,"In short, by night, ’twas fits or fretting;"

2840,A TALE,"Fond to be seen, she kept a bevy"
2841,A TALE,Of powder’d coxcombs at her levy;
2842,A TALE,"The ’squire and captain took their stations,      55"
2843,A TALE,And twenty other near relations;
2844,A TALE,"Jack suck’d his pipe, and often broke"
2845,A TALE,A sigh in suffocating smoke;
2846,A TALE,While all their hours were pass’d between
2847,A TALE,Insulting repartee or spleen.                     60
2848,A TALE,
2849,A TALE,"Thus as her faults each day were known,"
2850,A TALE,He thinks her features coarser grown;
2851,A TALE,"He fancies every vice she shows,"
2852,A TALE,"Or thins her lip, or points her nose:"
2853,A TALE,"Whenever rage or envy rise,                       65"
2854,A TALE,"How wide her mouth, how wild her eyes!"
2855,A TALE,"He knows not how, but so it is,"
2856,A TALE,Her face is grown a knowing phiz;
2857,A TALE,"And, though her fops are wond’rous civil,"
2858,A TALE,He thinks her ugly as the devil.                  70
2859,A TALE,
2860,A TALE,"Now, to perplex the ravell’d noose,"
2861,A TALE,"As each a different way pursues,"
2862,A TALE,"While sullen or loquacious strife,"
2863,A TALE,"Promis’d to hold them on for life,"
2864,A TALE,"That dire disease, whose ruthless power           75"
2865,A TALE,Withers the beauty’s transient flower:
2866,A TALE,"Lo!  the small-pox, whose horrid glare"
2867,A TALE,Levell’d its terrors at the fair;
2868,A TALE,"And, rifling ev’ry youthful grace,"
2869,A TALE,Left but the remnant of a face.                   80
2870,A TALE,
2871,A TALE,"The glass, grown hateful to her sight,"
2872,A TALE,Reflected now a perfect fright:
2873,A TALE,Each former art she vainly tries
2874,A TALE,To bring back lustre to her eyes.
2875,A TALE,"In vain she tries her paste and creams,           85"
2876,A TALE,"To smooth her skin, or hide its seams;"
2877,A TALE,"Her country beaux and city cousins,"
2878,A TALE,"Lovers no more, flew off by dozens:"
2879,A TALE,"The ’squire himself was seen to yield,"
2880,A TALE,And e’en the captain quit the field.              90
2881,A TALE,
2882,A TALE,"Poor Madam, now condemn’d to hack"
2883,A TALE,"The rest of life with anxious Jack,"
2884,A TALE,"Perceiving others fairly flown,"
2885,A TALE,Attempted pleasing him alone.
2886,A TALE,Jack soon was dazzl’d to behold                   95
2887,A TALE,Her present face surpass the old;
2888,A TALE,"With modesty her cheeks are dy’d,"
2889,A TALE,Humility displaces pride;
2890,A TALE,For tawdry finery is seen
2891,A TALE,A person ever neatly clean:                      100
2892,A TALE,"No more presuming on her sway,"
2893,A TALE,She learns good-nature every day;
2894,A TALE,"Serenely gay, and strict in duty,"
2895,A TALE,Jack finds his wife a perfect beauty.

3841,A POEM,
3842,A POEM,
3843,A POEM,"OF old, when Scarron his companions invited,"
3844,A POEM,"Each guest brought his dish, and the feast was united;"
3845,A POEM,"If our landlord supplies us with beef, and with fish,"
3846,A POEM,"Let each guest bring himself, and he brings the best dish:"
3847,A POEM,"Our Dean shall be venison, just fresh from the plains;      5"
3848,A POEM,"Our Burke shall be tongue, with a garnish of brains;"
3849,A POEM,"Our Will shall be wild-fowl, of excellent flavour,"
3850,A POEM,And Dick with his pepper shall heighten their savour:
3851,A POEM,"Our Cumberland’s sweet-bread its place shall obtain,"
3852,A POEM,"And Douglas is pudding, substantial and plain:             10"
3853,A POEM,Our Garrick’s a salad; for in him we see
3854,A POEM,"Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree:"
3855,A POEM,"To make out the dinner, full certain I am,"
3856,A POEM,"That Ridge is anchovy, and Reynolds is lamb;"
3857,A POEM,"That Hickey’s a capon, and by the same rule,               15"
3858,A POEM,Magnanimous Goldsmith a gooseberry fool.
3859,A POEM,"At a dinner so various, at such a repast,"
3860,A POEM,"Who’d not be a glutton, and stick to the last?"
3861,A POEM,"Here, waiter! more wine, let me sit while I’m able,"
3862,A POEM,Till all my companions sink under the table;               20
3863,A POEM,"Then, with chaos and blunders encircling my head,"
3864,A POEM,"Let me ponder, and tell what I think of the dead."
3865,A POEM,
3866,A POEM,"Here lies the good Dean, re-united to earth,"
3867,A POEM,"Who mix’d reason with pleasure, and wisdom with mirth:"
3868,A POEM,"If he had any faults, he has left us in doubt,             25"
3869,A POEM,"At least, in six weeks, I could not find ’em out;"
3870,A POEM,"Yet some have declar’d, and it can’t be denied ’em,"
3871,A POEM,That sly-boots was cursedly cunning to hide ’em.
3872,A POEM,
3873,A POEM,"Here lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such,"
3874,A POEM,"We scarcely can praise it, or blame it too much;           30"
3875,A POEM,"Who, born for the Universe, narrow’d his mind,"
3876,A POEM,And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.
3877,A POEM,"Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat"
3878,A POEM,To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote;
3879,A POEM,"Who, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining,     35"
3880,A POEM,"And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining;"
3881,A POEM,"Though equal to all things, for all things unfit,"
3882,A POEM,"Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit:"
3883,A POEM,"For a patriot, too cool; for a drudge, disobedient;"
3884,A POEM,And too fond of the _right_ to pursue the _expedient._         40
3885,A POEM,"In short, ’twas his fate, unemploy’d, or in place, Sir,"
3886,A POEM,"To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor."
3887,A POEM,
3888,A POEM,"Here lies honest William, whose heart was a mint,"
3889,A POEM,While the owner ne’er knew half the good that was in’t;
3890,A POEM,"The pupil of impulse, it forc’d him along,                 45"
3891,A POEM,"His conduct still right, with his argument wrong;"
3892,A POEM,"Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to roam,"
3893,A POEM,"The coachman was tipsy, the chariot drove home;"
3894,A POEM,Would you ask for his merits? alas! he had none;
3895,A POEM,"What was good was spontaneous, his faults were his own.    50"
3896,A POEM,
3897,A POEM,"Here lies honest Richard, whose fate I must sigh at;"
3898,A POEM,"Alas, that such frolic should now be so quiet!"
3899,A POEM,What spirits were his! what wit and what whim!
3900,A POEM,"Now breaking a jest, and now breaking a limb;"
3901,A POEM,"Now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball,           55"
3902,A POEM,"Now teasing and vexing, yet laughing at all!"
3903,A POEM,"In short, so provoking a devil was Dick,"
3904,A POEM,That we wish’d him full ten times a day at Old Nick;
3905,A POEM,"But, missing his mirth and agreeable vein,"
3906,A POEM,As often we wish’d to have Dick back again.                60
3907,A POEM,
3908,A POEM,"Here Cumberland lies, having acted his parts,"
3909,A POEM,"The Terence of England, the mender of hearts;"
3910,A POEM,"A flattering painter, who made it his care"
3911,A POEM,"To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are."
3912,A POEM,"His gallants are all faultless, his women divine,          65"
3913,A POEM,And comedy wonders at being so fine;
3914,A POEM,"Like a tragedy queen he has dizen’d her out,"
3915,A POEM,Or rather like tragedy giving a rout.
3916,A POEM,His fools have their follies so lost in a crowd
3917,A POEM,"Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud;           70"
3918,A POEM,"And coxcombs, alike in their failings alone,"
3919,A POEM,"Adopting his portraits, are pleas’d with their own."
3920,A POEM,"Say, where has our poet this malady caught?"
3921,A POEM,"Or, wherefore his characters thus without fault?"
3922,A POEM,"Say, was it that vainly directing his view                 75"
3923,A POEM,"To find out men’s virtues, and finding them few,"
3924,A POEM,"Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,"
3925,A POEM,"He grew lazy at last, and drew from himself?"
3926,A POEM,
3927,A POEM,"Here Douglas retires, from his toils to relax,"
3928,A POEM,"The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks:            80"
3929,A POEM,"Come, all ye quack bards, and ye quacking divines,"
3930,A POEM,"Come, and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines:"
3931,A POEM,"When Satire and Censure encircl’d his throne,"
3932,A POEM,"I fear’d for your safety, I fear’d for my own;"
3933,A POEM,"But now he is gone, and we want a detector,                85"
3934,A POEM,"Our Dodds shall be pious, our Kenricks shall lecture;"
3935,A POEM,"Macpherson write bombast, and call it a style,"
3936,A POEM,"Our Townshend make speeches, and I shall compile;"
3937,A POEM,"New Lauders and Bowers the Tweed shall cross over,"
3938,A POEM,No countryman living their tricks to discover;             90
3939,A POEM,"Detection her taper shall quench to a spark,"
3940,A POEM,"And Scotchman meet Scotchman, and cheat in the dark."
3941,A POEM,
3942,A POEM,"Here lies David Garrick, describe me, who can,"
3943,A POEM,An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man;
3944,A POEM,"As an actor, confess’d without rival to shine:             95"
3945,A POEM,"As a wit, if not first, in the very first line:"
3946,A POEM,"Yet, with talents like these, and an excellent heart,"
3947,A POEM,"The man had his failings, a dupe to his art."
3948,A POEM,"Like an ill-judging beauty, his colours he spread,"
3949,A POEM,And beplaster’d with rouge his own natural red.           100
3950,A POEM,"On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;"
3951,A POEM,’Twas only that when he was off he was acting.
3952,A POEM,"With no reason on earth to go out of his way,"
3953,A POEM,He turn’d and he varied full ten times a day.
3954,A POEM,"Though secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick        105"
3955,A POEM,"If they were not his own by finessing and trick,"
3956,A POEM,"He cast off his friends, as a huntsman his pack,"
3957,A POEM,For he knew when he pleas’d he could whistle them back.
3958,A POEM,"Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow’d what came,"
3959,A POEM,And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame;           110
3960,A POEM,"Till his relish grown callous, almost to disease,"
3961,A POEM,Who pepper’d the highest was surest to please.
3962,A POEM,"But let us be candid, and speak out our mind,"
3963,A POEM,"If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind."
3964,A POEM,"Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls so grave,           115"
3965,A POEM,"What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave!"
3966,A POEM,"How did Grub-street re-echo the shouts you rais’d,"
3967,A POEM,"While he was be-Roscius’d, and you were be-prais’d!"
3968,A POEM,"But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,"
3969,A POEM,"To act as an angel, and mix with the skies:               120"
3970,A POEM,"Those poets, who owe their best fame to his skill,"
3971,A POEM,"Shall still be his flatterers, go where he will."
3972,A POEM,"Old Shakespeare, receive him, with praise and with love,"
3973,A POEM,And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.
3974,A POEM,
3975,A POEM,"Here Hickey reclines, a most blunt, pleasant creature,  125"
3976,A POEM,And slander itself must allow him good nature:
3977,A POEM,"He cherish’d his friend, and he relish’d a bumper;"
3978,A POEM,"Yet one fault he had, and that one was a thumper."
3979,A POEM,Perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser!
3980,A POEM,"I answer, no, no, for he always was wiser:                130"
3981,A POEM,"Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat?"
3982,A POEM,His very worst foe can’t accuse him of that:
3983,A POEM,"Perhaps he confided in men as they go,"
3984,A POEM,And so was too foolishly honest! Ah no!
3985,A POEM,"Then what was his failing? come, tell it, and burn ye!    135"
3986,A POEM,"He was, could he help it?—a special attorney."
3987,A POEM,
3988,A POEM,"Here Reynolds is laid, and, to tell you my mind,"
3989,A POEM,He has not left a better or wiser behind:
3990,A POEM,"His pencil was striking, resistless, and grand;"
3991,A POEM,"His manners were gentle, complying, and bland;            140"
3992,A POEM,"Still born to improve us in every part,"
3993,A POEM,"His pencil our faces, his manners our heart:"
3994,A POEM,"To coxcombs averse, yet most civilly steering,"
3995,A POEM,When they judg’d without skill he was still hard of hearing:
3996,A POEM,"When they talk’d of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff, 145"
3997,A POEM,"He shifted his trumpet, and only took snuff."

4001,POSTSCRIPT,
4002,POSTSCRIPT,"After the Fourth Edition of this Poem was printed, the Publisher received"
4003,POSTSCRIPT,"an Epitaph on Mr. Whitefoord, from a friend of the late Doctor Goldsmith,"
4004,POSTSCRIPT,"inclosed in a letter, of which the following is an abstract:—"
4005,POSTSCRIPT,
4006,POSTSCRIPT,"‘I have in my possession a sheet of paper, containing near forty lines in"
4007,POSTSCRIPT,"the Doctor’s own hand-writing: there are many scattered, broken verses, on"
4008,POSTSCRIPT,"Sir Jos. Reynolds, Counsellor Ridge, Mr. Beauclerk, and Mr. Whitefoord."
4009,POSTSCRIPT,The Epitaph on the last-mentioned gentleman is the only one that is
4010,POSTSCRIPT,"finished, and therefore I have copied it, that you may add it to the next"
4011,POSTSCRIPT,edition. It is a striking proof of Doctor Goldsmith’s good-nature. I saw
4012,POSTSCRIPT,"this sheet of paper in the Doctor’s room, five or six days before he died;"
4013,POSTSCRIPT,"and, as I had got all the other Epitaphs, I asked him if I might take it."
4014,POSTSCRIPT,"“_In truth you may, my Boy_,” (replied he,) “_for it will be of no"
4015,POSTSCRIPT,use to me where I am going._”’
4016,POSTSCRIPT,
4017,POSTSCRIPT,"HERE Whitefoord reclines, and deny it who can,"
4018,POSTSCRIPT,"Though he _merrily_ liv’d, he is now a ‘grave’ man;"
4019,POSTSCRIPT,"Rare compound of oddity, frolic, and fun!"
4020,POSTSCRIPT,"Who relish’d a joke, and rejoic’d in a pun;               150"
4021,POSTSCRIPT,"Whose temper was generous, open, sincere;"
4022,POSTSCRIPT,"A stranger to flatt’ry, a stranger to fear;"
4023,POSTSCRIPT,Who scatter’d around wit and humour at will;
4024,POSTSCRIPT,Whose daily _bons mots_ half a column might fill;
4025,POSTSCRIPT,"A Scotchman, from pride and from prejudice free;          155"
4026,POSTSCRIPT,"A scholar, yet surely no pedant was he."
4027,POSTSCRIPT,
4028,POSTSCRIPT,"What pity, alas! that so lib’ral a mind"
4029,POSTSCRIPT,Should so long be to news-paper essays confin’d;
4030,POSTSCRIPT,"Who perhaps to the summit of science could soar,"
4031,POSTSCRIPT,Yet content ‘if the table he set on a roar’;              160
4032,POSTSCRIPT,"Whose talents to fill any station were fit,"
4033,POSTSCRIPT,Yet happy if Woodfall confess’d him a wit.
4034,POSTSCRIPT,
4035,POSTSCRIPT,Ye news-paper witlings! ye pert scribbling folks
4036,POSTSCRIPT,"Who copied his squibs, and re-echoed his jokes;"
4037,POSTSCRIPT,"Ye tame imitators, ye servile herd, come,                 165"

4096,A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LORD,A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LORD
4097,CLARE,CLARE
4098,CLARE,
4099,CLARE,
4100,CLARE,"THANKS, my Lord, for your venison, for finer or fatter"
4101,CLARE,"Never rang’d in a forest, or smok’d in a platter;"
4102,CLARE,"The haunch was a picture for painters to study,"
4103,CLARE,"The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy."
4104,CLARE,"Though my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help regretting  5"
4105,CLARE,To spoil such a delicate picture by eating;
4106,CLARE,"I had thoughts, in my chambers, to place it in view,"
4107,CLARE,To be shown to my friends as a piece of _virtù_;
4108,CLARE,"As in some Irish houses, where things are so so,"
4109,CLARE,One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show:                    10
4110,CLARE,"But for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,"
4111,CLARE,They’d as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in.
4112,CLARE,But hold—let me pause—Don’t I hear you pronounce
4113,CLARE,This tale of the bacon a damnable bounce?
4114,CLARE,"Well, suppose it a bounce—sure a poet may try,              15"
4115,CLARE,"By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly."
4116,CLARE,
4117,CLARE,"But, my Lord, it’s no bounce:  I protest in my turn,"
4118,CLARE,It’s a truth—and your Lordship may ask Mr. Byrne.
4119,CLARE,"To go on with my tale—as I gaz’d on the haunch,"
4120,CLARE,I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch;          20
4121,CLARE,"So I cut it, and sent it to Reynolds undress’d,"
4122,CLARE,"To paint it, or eat it, just as he lik’d best."
4123,CLARE,Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose;
4124,CLARE,’Twas a neck and a breast—that might rival M—r—’s:
4125,CLARE,"But in parting with these I was puzzled again,              25"
4126,CLARE,"With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when."
4127,CLARE,"There’s H—d, and C—y, and H—rth, and H—ff,"
4128,CLARE,I think they love venison—I know they love beef;
4129,CLARE,There’s my countryman H—gg—ns—Oh! let him
4130,CLARE,"alone,"
4131,CLARE,"For making a blunder, or picking a bone.                    30"
4132,CLARE,"But hang it—to poets who seldom can eat,"
4133,CLARE,Your very good mutton’s a very good treat;
4134,CLARE,"Such dainties to them, their health it might hurt,"
4135,CLARE,"It’s like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt."
4136,CLARE,"While thus I debated, in reverie centred,                   35"
4137,CLARE,"An acquaintance, a friend as he call’d himself, enter’d;"
4138,CLARE,"An under-bred, fine-spoken fellow was he,"
4139,CLARE,And he smil’d as he look’d at the venison and me.
4140,CLARE,"‘What have we got here?—Why, this is good eating!"
4141,CLARE,"Your own, I suppose—or is it in waiting?’                   40"
4142,CLARE,"‘Why, whose should it be?’ cried I with a flounce,"
4143,CLARE,‘I get these things often;’—but that was a bounce:
4144,CLARE,"‘Some lords, my acquaintance, that settle the nation,"
4145,CLARE,Are pleas’d to be kind—but I hate ostentation.’
4146,CLARE,
4147,CLARE,"‘If that be the case, then,’ cried he, very gay,          45"
4148,CLARE,‘I’m glad I have taken this house in my way.
4149,CLARE,To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;
4150,CLARE,No words—I insist on’t—precisely at three:
4151,CLARE,"We’ll have Johnson, and Burke; all the wits will be there;"
4152,CLARE,"My acquaintance is slight, or I’d ask my Lord Clare.        50"
4153,CLARE,"And now that I think on’t, as I am a sinner!"
4154,CLARE,We wanted this venison to make out the dinner.
4155,CLARE,"What say you—a pasty? it shall, and it must,"
4156,CLARE,"And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust."
4157,CLARE,"Here, porter!—this venison with me to Mile-end;             55"
4158,CLARE,No stirring—I beg—my dear friend—my dear friend!
4159,CLARE,"Thus snatching his hat, he brush’d off like the wind,"
4160,CLARE,And the porter and eatables follow’d behind.
4161,CLARE,
4162,CLARE,"Left alone to reflect, having emptied my shelf,"
4163,CLARE,‘And nobody with me at sea but myself’;                     60
4164,CLARE,"Though I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,"
4165,CLARE,"Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good venison pasty,"
4166,CLARE,"Were things that I never dislik’d in my life,"
4167,CLARE,"Though clogg’d with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife."
4168,CLARE,"So next day, in due splendour to make my approach,          65"
4169,CLARE,I drove to his door in my own hackney coach.
4170,CLARE,
4171,CLARE,"When come to the place where we all were to dine,"
4172,CLARE,(A chair-lumber’d closet just twelve feet by nine:)
4173,CLARE,"My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite dumb,"
4174,CLARE,With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come;         70
4175,CLARE,"‘For I knew it,’ he cried, ‘both eternally fail,"
4176,CLARE,"The one with his speeches, and t’other with Thrale;"
4177,CLARE,"But no matter, I’ll warrant we’ll make up the party"
4178,CLARE,"With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty."
4179,CLARE,"The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew,                    75"
4180,CLARE,They[’re] both of them merry and authors like you;
4181,CLARE,"The one writes the _Snarler_, the other the _Scourge_;"
4182,CLARE,Some think he writes _Cinna_—he owns to _Panurge._’
4183,CLARE,"While thus he describ’d them by trade, and by name,"
4184,CLARE,They enter’d and dinner was serv’d as they came.            80
4185,CLARE,
4186,CLARE,"At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen,"
4187,CLARE,At the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureen;
4188,CLARE,At the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot;
4189,CLARE,In the middle a place where the pasty—was not.
4190,CLARE,"Now, my Lord as for tripe, it’s my utter aversion,          85"
4191,CLARE,And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian;
4192,CLARE,"So there I sat stuck, like a horse in a pound,"
4193,CLARE,While the bacon and liver went merrily round.
4194,CLARE,"But what vex’d me most was that d—’d Scottish rogue,"
4195,CLARE,"With his long-winded speeches, his smiles and his brogue;   90"
4196,CLARE,"And, ‘Madam,’ quoth he, ‘may this bit be my poison,"
4197,CLARE,A prettier dinner I never set eyes on;
4198,CLARE,"Pray a slice of your liver, though may I be curs’d,"
4199,CLARE,But I’ve eat of your tripe till I’m ready to burst.’
4200,CLARE,"‘The tripe,’ quoth the Jew, with his chocolate cheek,       95"
4201,CLARE,‘I could dine on this tripe seven days in the week:
4202,CLARE,I like these here dinners so pretty and small;
4203,CLARE,"But your friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.’"
4204,CLARE,"‘O—Oh!’ quoth my friend, ‘he’ll come on in a trice,"
4205,CLARE,He’s keeping a corner for something that’s nice:           100
4206,CLARE,"There’s a pasty’—‘A pasty!’ repeated the Jew,"
4207,CLARE,‘I don’t care if I keep a corner for’t too.’
4208,CLARE,"‘What the de’il, mon, a pasty!’ re-echoed the Scot,"
4209,CLARE,"‘Though splitting, I’ll still keep a corner for thot.’"
4210,CLARE,"‘We’ll all keep a corner,’ the lady cried out;             105"
4211,CLARE,"‘We’ll all keep a corner,’ was echoed about."
4212,CLARE,"While thus we resolv’d, and the pasty delay’d,"
4213,CLARE,"With look that quite petrified, enter’d the maid;"
4214,CLARE,"A visage so sad, and so pale with affright,"
4215,CLARE,Wak’d Priam in drawing his curtains by night.              110
4216,CLARE,"But we quickly found out, for who could mistake her?"
4217,CLARE,That she came with some terrible news from the baker:
4218,CLARE,"And so it fell out, for that negligent sloven"
4219,CLARE,Had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven
4220,CLARE,Sad Philomel thus—but let similes drop—                    115
4221,CLARE,"And now that I think on’t, the story may stop."
4222,CLARE,"To be plain, my good Lord, it’s but labour misplac’d"
4223,CLARE,To send such good verses to one of your taste;
4224,CLARE,You’ve got an odd something—a kind of discerning—
4225,CLARE,A relish—a taste—sicken’d over by learning;                120
4226,CLARE,"At least, it’s your temper, as very well known,"
4227,CLARE,That you think very slightly of all that’s your own:
4228,CLARE,"So, perhaps, in your habits of thinking amiss,"
4229,CLARE,"You may make a mistake, and think slightly of this."

5250,LETTER IN PROSE AND VERSE TO MRS. BUNBURY,
5251,"MADAM,","MADAM,"
5252,"MADAM,",I read your letter with all that allowance
5253,"MADAM,","which critical candour could require, but after all find so much to object"
5254,"MADAM,","to, and so much to raise my indignation, that I cannot help giving it a"
5255,"MADAM,",serious answer.
5256,"MADAM,",
5257,"MADAM,","I am not so ignorant, Madam, as not to see there are many sarcasms"
5258,"MADAM,","contained in it, and solecisms also. (Solecism is a word that comes from"
5259,"MADAM,","the town of Soleis in Attica, among the Greeks, built by Solon, and"
5260,"MADAM,","applied as we use the word Kidderminster for curtains, from a town also of"
5261,"MADAM,","that name;—but this is learning you have no taste for!)—I say,"
5262,"MADAM,","Madam, there are sarcasms in it, and solecisms also. But not to seem an"
5263,"MADAM,","ill-natured critic, I’ll take leave to quote your own words, and give you"
5264,"MADAM,",my remarks upon them as they occur. You begin as follows:—
5265,"MADAM,",
5266,"MADAM,",
5267,"MADAM,","‘I hope, my good Doctor, you soon will be here,"
5268,"MADAM,",
5269,"MADAM,","And your spring-velvet coat very smart will appear,"
5270,"MADAM,",
5271,"MADAM,",To open our ball the first day of the year.’
5272,"MADAM,",
5273,"MADAM,","Pray, Madam, where did you ever find the epithet ‘good,’ applied to the"
5274,"MADAM,","title of Doctor? Had you called me ‘learned Doctor,’ or ‘grave Doctor,’ or"
5275,"MADAM,","‘noble Doctor,’ it might be allowable, because they belong to the"
5276,"MADAM,","profession. But, not to cavil at trifles, you talk of my ‘spring-velvet"
5277,"MADAM,","coat,’ and advise me to wear it the first day in the year,—that is,"
5278,"MADAM,",in the middle of winter!—a spring-velvet in the middle of winter!!!
5279,"MADAM,",That would be
5280,"MADAM,",
5281,"MADAM,","a solecism indeed! and yet, to increase the inconsistence, in another part"
5282,"MADAM,","of your letter you call me a beau. Now, on one side or other, you must be"
5283,"MADAM,","wrong. If I am a beau, I can never think of wearing a spring-velvet in"
5284,"MADAM,","winter: and if I am not a beau, why then, that explains itself. But let me"
5285,"MADAM,",go on to your two next strange lines:—
5286,"MADAM,",
5287,"MADAM,",
5288,"MADAM,","‘And bring with you a wig, that is modish and gay,"
5289,"MADAM,",
5290,"MADAM,",dance with the girls that are makers of hay.’
5291,"MADAM,",
5292,"MADAM,","The absurdity of making hay at Christmas, you yourself seem sensible of:"
5293,"MADAM,",you say your sister will laugh; and so indeed she well may! The Latins
5294,"MADAM,","have an expression for a contemptuous sort of laughter, ‘Naso contemnere"
5295,"MADAM,","adunco’; that is, to laugh with a crooked nose. She may laugh at you in"
5296,"MADAM,",the manner of the ancients if she thinks fit. But now I come to the most
5297,"MADAM,","extraordinary of all extraordinary propositions, which is, to take your"
5298,"MADAM,",and your sister’s advice in playing at loo. The presumption of the offer
5299,"MADAM,",raises my indignation beyond the bounds of prose; it inspires me at once
5300,"MADAM,",with verse and resentment. I take advice! and from whom? You shall hear.
5301,"MADAM,",
5302,"MADAM,","First let me suppose, what may shortly be true,"
5303,"MADAM,","The company set, and the word to be, Loo;"
5304,"MADAM,","All smirking, and pleasant, and big with adventure,"
5305,"MADAM,",And ogling the stake which is fix’d in the centre.
5306,"MADAM,","Round and round go the cards, while I inwardly damn             5"
5307,"MADAM,",At never once finding a visit from Pam.
5308,"MADAM,","I lay down my stake, apparently cool,"
5309,"MADAM,",While the harpies about me all pocket the pool.
5310,"MADAM,","I fret in my gizzard, yet, cautious and sly,"
5311,"MADAM,",I wish all my friends may be bolder than I:                    10
5312,"MADAM,","Yet still they sit snug, not a creature will aim"
5313,"MADAM,",By losing their money to venture at fame.
5314,"MADAM,","’Tis in vain that at niggardly caution I scold,"
5315,"MADAM,",’Tis in vain that I flatter the brave and the bold:
5316,"MADAM,","All play their own way, and they think me an ass,—             15"
5317,"MADAM,","‘What does Mrs. Bunbury?’ ‘I, Sir? I pass.’"
5318,"MADAM,","‘Pray what does Miss Horneck? Take courage, come do,’—"
5319,"MADAM,","‘Who, I? let me see, Sir, why I must pass too.’"
5320,"MADAM,","Mr. Bunbury frets, and I fret like the devil,"
5321,"MADAM,","To see them so cowardly, lucky, and civil.                     20"
5322,"MADAM,","Yet still I sit snug, and continue to sigh on,"
5323,"MADAM,","Till made by my losses as bold as a lion,"
5324,"MADAM,","I venture at all,—while my avarice regards"
5325,"MADAM,","The whole pool as my own—‘Come, give me five cards.’"
5326,"MADAM,","‘Well done!’ cry the ladies; ‘Ah, Doctor, that’s good!         25"
5327,"MADAM,",The pool’s very rich—ah! the Doctor is loo’d!’
5328,"MADAM,","Thus foil’d in my courage, on all sides perplex’d,"
5329,"MADAM,",I ask for advice from the lady that’s next:
5330,"MADAM,","‘Pray, Ma’am, be so good as to give your advice;"
5331,"MADAM,",Don’t you think the best way is to venture for ’t twice?’      30
5332,"MADAM,","‘I advise,’ cries the lady, ‘to try it, I own.—"
5333,"MADAM,","Ah! the Doctor is loo’d! Come, Doctor, put down.’"
5334,"MADAM,","Thus, playing, and playing, I still grow more eager,"
5335,"MADAM,","And so bold, and so bold, I’m at last a bold beggar."
5336,"MADAM,","Now, ladies, I ask, if law-matters you’re skill’d in,          35"
5337,"MADAM,",Whether crimes such as yours should not come before Fielding?
5338,"MADAM,","For giving advice that is not worth a straw,"
5339,"MADAM,",May well be call’d picking of pockets in law;
5340,"MADAM,","And picking of pockets, with which I now charge ye,"
5341,"MADAM,","Is, by quinto Elizabeth, Death without Clergy.                 40"
5342,"MADAM,","What justice, when both to the Old Bailey brought!"
5343,"MADAM,","By the gods, I’ll enjoy it; though ’tis but in thought!"
5344,"MADAM,","Both are plac’d at the bar, with all proper decorum,"
5345,"MADAM,","With bunches of fennel, and nosegays before ’em;"
5346,"MADAM,",Both cover their faces with mobs and all that;                 45
5347,"MADAM,","But the judge bids them, angrily, take off their hat."
5348,"MADAM,","When uncover’d, a buzz of enquiry runs round,—"
5349,"MADAM,",‘Pray what are their crimes?’—‘They’ve been pilfering found.’
5350,"MADAM,","‘But, pray, whom have they pilfer’d?’—‘A Doctor, I hear.’"
5351,"MADAM,","‘What, yon solemn-faced, odd-looking man that stands near!’    50"
5352,"MADAM,",‘The same.’—‘What a pity! how does it surprise one!
5353,"MADAM,",Two handsomer culprits I never set eyes on!’
5354,"MADAM,","Then their friends all come round me with cringing and leering,"
5355,"MADAM,","To melt me to pity, and soften my swearing."
5356,"MADAM,","First Sir Charles advances with phrases well strung,           55"
5357,"MADAM,","‘Consider, dear Doctor, the girls are but young.’"
5358,"MADAM,","‘The younger the worse,’ I return him again,"
5359,"MADAM,",‘It shows that their habits are all dyed in grain.’
5360,"MADAM,","‘But then they’re so handsome, one’s bosom it grieves.’"
5361,"MADAM,","‘What signifies _handsome_, when people are thieves?’            60"
5362,"MADAM,",‘But where is your justice? their cases are hard.’
5363,"MADAM,",‘What signifies _justice_? I want the _reward_.

5365,"MADAM,",
5366,"MADAM,",There’s the parish of Edmonton offers forty pounds;
5367,"MADAM,","there’s the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, offers forty pounds;"
5368,"MADAM,","there’s the parish of Tyburn, from the Hog-in-the-Pound to St. Giles’s"
5369,"MADAM,","watchhouse, offers forty pounds,—I shall have all that if I convict"
5370,"MADAM,",them!’—
5371,"MADAM,",
5372,"MADAM,","‘But consider their case,—it may yet be your own!"
5373,"MADAM,",And see how they kneel! Is your heart made of stone?’
5374,"MADAM,","This moves:—so at last I agree to relent,                      65"
5375,"MADAM,","For ten pounds in hand, and ten pounds to be spent."
5376,"MADAM,",
5377,"MADAM,",
5378,"MADAM,","I challenge you all to answer this: I tell you, you cannot. It cuts deep;—but"
5379,"MADAM,",now for the rest of the letter: and next— but I want room—so I
5380,"MADAM,",believe I shall battle the rest out at Barton some day next week.

5519,TRANSLATED,Wing’d with swift death to pierce through ev’ry part.
5520,TRANSLATED,"The fiery steed, regardless of the reins,"

5523,TRANSLATED,Leaps o’er a double space at ev’ry bound:                  130 |
5524,TRANSLATED,And shifts from white or black to diff’rent colour’d ground.   |
5525,TRANSLATED,"But the fierce Queen, whom dangers ne’er dismay,"

5527,TRANSLATED,"In a straight line spreads her destruction wide,"
5528,TRANSLATED,"To left or right, before, behind, aside.                   135"
5529,TRANSLATED,Yet may she never with a circling course
5530,TRANSLATED,Sweep to the battle like the fretful Horse;
5531,TRANSLATED,"But unconfin’d may at her pleasure stray,"
5532,TRANSLATED,If neither friend nor foe block up the way;
5533,TRANSLATED,"For to o’erleap a warrior, ’tis decreed                    140"
5534,TRANSLATED,Those only dare who curb the snorting steed.
5535,TRANSLATED,With greater caution and majestic state
5536,TRANSLATED,The warlike Monarchs in the scene of fate
5537,TRANSLATED,"Direct their motions, since for these appear"
5538,TRANSLATED,"Zealous each hope, and anxious ev’ry fear.                 145"
5539,TRANSLATED,"While the King’s safe, with resolution stern"
5540,TRANSLATED,They clasp their arms; but should a sudden turn
5541,TRANSLATED,"Make him a captive, instantly they yield,"
5542,TRANSLATED,Resolved to share his fortune in the field.
5543,TRANSLATED,He moves on slow; with reverence profound                  150
5544,TRANSLATED,"His faithful troops encompass him around,"
5545,TRANSLATED,"And oft, to break some instant fatal scheme,"
5546,TRANSLATED,"Rush to their fates, their sov’reign to redeem;"
5547,TRANSLATED,"While he, unanxious where to wound the foe,"
5548,TRANSLATED,Need only shift and guard against a blow.                  155
5549,TRANSLATED,"But none, however, can presume t’ appear"
5550,TRANSLATED,"Within his reach, but must his vengeance fear;"
5551,TRANSLATED,For he on ev’ry side his terror throws;
5552,TRANSLATED,"But when he changes from his first repose,"
5553,TRANSLATED,"Moves but one step, most awfully sedate,                   160"
5554,TRANSLATED,"Or idly roving, or intent on fate."
5555,TRANSLATED,These are the sev’ral and establish’d laws:
5556,TRANSLATED,Now see how each maintains his bloody cause.
5557,TRANSLATED,"Here paused the god, but (since whene’er they wage"
5558,TRANSLATED,War here on earth the gods themselves engage               165
5559,TRANSLATED,"In mutual battle as they hate or love,"
5560,TRANSLATED,"And the most stubborn war is oft above),"
5561,TRANSLATED,Almighty Jove commands the circling train
5562,TRANSLATED,"Of gods from fav’ring either to abstain,"
5563,TRANSLATED,And let the fight be silently survey’d;                    170
5564,TRANSLATED,And added solemn threats if disobey’d.
5565,TRANSLATED,Then call’d he Phoebus from among the Powers
5566,TRANSLATED,"And subtle Hermes, whom in softer hours"
5567,TRANSLATED,Fair Maia bore: youth wanton’d in their face;
5568,TRANSLATED,"Both in life’s bloom, both shone with equal grace.         175"
5569,TRANSLATED,Hermes as yet had never wing’d his feet;
5570,TRANSLATED,As yet Apollo in his radiant seat
5571,TRANSLATED,"Had never driv’n his chariot through the air,"
5572,TRANSLATED,Known by his bow alone and golden hair.
5573,TRANSLATED,"These Jove commission’d to attempt the fray,               180"
5574,TRANSLATED,And rule the sportive military day;
5575,TRANSLATED,"Bid them agree which party each maintains,"
5576,TRANSLATED,And promised a reward that’s worth their pains.
5577,TRANSLATED,The greater took their seats; on either hand
5578,TRANSLATED,"Respectful the less gods in order stand,                   185"
5579,TRANSLATED,"But careful not to interrupt their play,"
5580,TRANSLATED,By hinting when t’ advance or run away.
5581,TRANSLATED,"Then they examine, who shall first proceed"
5582,TRANSLATED,"To try their courage, and their army lead."
5583,TRANSLATED,"Chance gave it for the White, that he should go            190"
5584,TRANSLATED,First with a brave defiance to the foe.
5585,TRANSLATED,Awhile he ponder’d which of all his train
5586,TRANSLATED,Should bear his first commission o’er the plain;
5587,TRANSLATED,And then determined to begin the scene
5588,TRANSLATED,With him that stood before to guard the Queen.             195
5589,TRANSLATED,He took a double step: with instant care
5590,TRANSLATED,Does the black Monarch in his turn prepare
5591,TRANSLATED,"The adverse champion, and with stern command"
5592,TRANSLATED,Bid him repel the charge with equal hand.
5593,TRANSLATED,"There front to front, the midst of all the field,          200"
5594,TRANSLATED,With furious threats their shining arms they wield;
5595,TRANSLATED,"Yet vain the conflict, neither can prevail"
5596,TRANSLATED,While in one path each other they assail.
5597,TRANSLATED,On ev’ry side to their assistance fly
5598,TRANSLATED,"Their fellow soldiers, and with strong supply              205"
5599,TRANSLATED,"Crowd to the battle, but no bloody stain"
5600,TRANSLATED,Tinctures their armour; sportive in the plain
5601,TRANSLATED,"Mars plays awhile, and in excursion slight"
5602,TRANSLATED,"Harmless they sally forth, or wait the fight."
5603,TRANSLATED,"But now the swarthy Foot, that first appear’d            210"
5604,TRANSLATED,"To front the foe, his pond’rous jav’lin rear’d"
5605,TRANSLATED,"Leftward aslant, and a pale warrior slays,"
5606,TRANSLATED,"Spurns him aside, and boldly takes his place."
5607,TRANSLATED,"Unhappy youth, his danger not to spy!"
5608,TRANSLATED,"Instant he fell, and triumph’d but to die.                 215"
5609,TRANSLATED,At this the sable King with prudent care
5610,TRANSLATED,"Removed his station from the middle square,"
5611,TRANSLATED,"And slow retiring to the farthest ground,"
5612,TRANSLATED,"There safely lurk’d, with troops entrench’d around."
5613,TRANSLATED,Then from each quarter to the war advance                  220
5614,TRANSLATED,"The furious Knights, and poise the trembling lance:"
5615,TRANSLATED,"By turns they rush, by turns the victors yield,"
5616,TRANSLATED,Heaps of dead Foot choke up the crimson’d field:
5617,TRANSLATED,They fall unable to retreat; around
5618,TRANSLATED,The clang of arms and iron hoofs resound.                  225
5619,TRANSLATED,But while young Phoebus pleased himself to view
5620,TRANSLATED,"His furious Knight destroy the vulgar crew,"
5621,TRANSLATED,Sly Hermes long’d t’ attempt with secret aim
5622,TRANSLATED,Some noble act of more exalted fame.
5623,TRANSLATED,"For this, he inoffensive pass’d along                      230"
5624,TRANSLATED,"Through ranks of Foot, and midst the trembling throng"
5625,TRANSLATED,"Sent his left Horse, that free without confine"
5626,TRANSLATED,"Rov’d o’er the plain, upon some great design"
5627,TRANSLATED,"Against the King himself. At length he stood,"
5628,TRANSLATED,"And having fix’d his station as he would,                  235"
5629,TRANSLATED,Threaten’d at once with instant fate the King
5630,TRANSLATED,And th’ Indian beast that guarded the right wing.
5631,TRANSLATED,"Apollo sigh’d, and hast’ning to relieve"
5632,TRANSLATED,"The straiten’d Monarch, griev’d that he must leave"
5633,TRANSLATED,"His martial Elephant expos’d to fate,                      240"
5634,TRANSLATED,And view’d with pitying eyes his dang’rous state.
5635,TRANSLATED,First in his thoughts however was his care
5636,TRANSLATED,"To save his King, whom to the neighbouring square"
5637,TRANSLATED,"On the right hand, he snatch’d with trembling flight;"
5638,TRANSLATED,"At this with fury springs the sable Knight,                245"
5639,TRANSLATED,"Drew his keen sword, and rising to the blow,"
5640,TRANSLATED,Sent the great Indian brute to shades below.
5641,TRANSLATED,O fatal loss! for none except the Queen
5642,TRANSLATED,Spreads such a terror through the bloody scene.
5643,TRANSLATED,"Yet shall you ne’er unpunish’d boast your prize,           250 |"
5644,TRANSLATED,The Delian god with stern resentment cries;                    |
5645,TRANSLATED,"And wedg’d him round with Foot, and pour’d in fresh supplies.  |"
5646,TRANSLATED,Thus close besieg’d trembling he cast his eye
5647,TRANSLATED,"Around the plain, but saw no shelter nigh,"
5648,TRANSLATED,"No way for flight; for here the Queen oppos’d,             255"
5649,TRANSLATED,The Foot in phalanx there the passage clos’d:
5650,TRANSLATED,"At length he fell; yet not unpleas’d with fate,"
5651,TRANSLATED,Since victim to a Queen’s vindictive hate.
5652,TRANSLATED,"With grief and fury burns the whiten’d host,"
5653,TRANSLATED,One of their Tow’rs thus immaturely lost.                  260
5654,TRANSLATED,As when a bull has in contention stern
5655,TRANSLATED,"Lost his right horn, with double vengeance burn"
5656,TRANSLATED,"His thoughts for war, with blood he’s cover’d o’er,"
5657,TRANSLATED,"And the woods echo to his dismal roar,"
5658,TRANSLATED,"So look’d the flaxen host, when angry fate                 265"
5659,TRANSLATED,O’erturn’d the Indian bulwark of their state.
5660,TRANSLATED,"Fired at this great success, with double rage"
5661,TRANSLATED,"Apollo hurries on his troops t’ engage,"
5662,TRANSLATED,"For blood and havoc wild; and, while he leads"
5663,TRANSLATED,"His troops thus careless, loses both his steeds:           270"
5664,TRANSLATED,"For if some adverse warriors were o’erthrown,"
5665,TRANSLATED,He little thought what dangers threat his own.
5666,TRANSLATED,But slyer Hermes with observant eyes
5667,TRANSLATED,"March’d slowly cautious, and at distance spies"
5668,TRANSLATED,"What moves must next succeed, what dangers next arise.     275"
5669,TRANSLATED,"Often would he, the stately Queen to snare,"
5670,TRANSLATED,"The slender Foot to front her arms prepare,"
5671,TRANSLATED,And to conceal his scheme he sighs and feigns
5672,TRANSLATED,Such a wrong step would frustrate all his pains.
5673,TRANSLATED,"Just then an Archer, from the right-hand view,             280"
5674,TRANSLATED,"At the pale Queen his arrow boldly drew,"
5675,TRANSLATED,"Unseen by Phoebus, who, with studious thought,"
5676,TRANSLATED,From the left side a vulgar hero brought.
5677,TRANSLATED,"But tender Venus, with a pitying eye,"
5678,TRANSLATED,"Viewing the sad destruction that was nigh,                 285"
5679,TRANSLATED,Wink’d upon Phoebus (for the Goddess sat
5680,TRANSLATED,By chance directly opposite); at that
5681,TRANSLATED,"Roused in an instant, young Apollo threw"
5682,TRANSLATED,His eyes around the field his troops to view:
5683,TRANSLATED,"Perceiv’d the danger, and with sudden fright          |    290"
5684,TRANSLATED,"Withdrew the Foot that he had sent to fight,          |"
5685,TRANSLATED,And sav’d his trembling Queen by seasonable flight.   |
5686,TRANSLATED,But Maia’s son with shouts fill’d all the coast:
5687,TRANSLATED,"The Queen, he cried, the important Queen is lost."
5688,TRANSLATED,"Phoebus, howe’er, resolving to maintain                    295"
5689,TRANSLATED,"What he had done, bespoke the heavenly train."
5690,TRANSLATED,"What mighty harm, in sportive mimic flight,"
5691,TRANSLATED,"Is it to set a little blunder right,"
5692,TRANSLATED,When no preliminary rule debarr’d?
5693,TRANSLATED,"If you henceforward, Mercury, would guard                  300"
5694,TRANSLATED,"Against such practice, let us make the law:"
5695,TRANSLATED,"And whosoe’er shall first to battle draw,"
5696,TRANSLATED,"Or white, or black, remorseless let him go"
5697,TRANSLATED,"At all events, and dare the angry foe."
5698,TRANSLATED,"He said, and this opinion pleased around:                305"
5699,TRANSLATED,"Jove turn’d aside, and on his daughter frown’d,"
5700,TRANSLATED,"Unmark’d by Hermes, who, with strange surprise,"
5701,TRANSLATED,"Fretted and foam’d, and roll’d his ferret eyes,"
5702,TRANSLATED,And but with great reluctance could refrain
5703,TRANSLATED,From dashing at a blow all off the plain.                  310
5704,TRANSLATED,"Then he resolved to interweave deceits,—"
5705,TRANSLATED,To carry on the war by tricks and cheats.
5706,TRANSLATED,"Instant he call’d an Archer from the throng,"
5707,TRANSLATED,And bid him like the courser wheel along:
5708,TRANSLATED,"Bounding he springs, and threats the pallid Queen.         315"
5709,TRANSLATED,"The fraud, however, was by Phoebus seen;"
5710,TRANSLATED,"He smiled, and, turning to the Gods, he said:"
5711,TRANSLATED,"Though, Hermes, you are perfect in your trade,"
5712,TRANSLATED,"And you can trick and cheat to great surprise,          |"
5713,TRANSLATED,These little sleights no more shall blind my eyes;      |  320
5714,TRANSLATED,"Correct them if you please, the more you thus disguise. |"
5715,TRANSLATED,The circle laugh’d aloud; and Maia’s son
5716,TRANSLATED,(As if it had but by mistake been done)
5717,TRANSLATED,"Recall’d his Archer, and with motion due,"
5718,TRANSLATED,"Bid him advance, the combat to renew.                      325"
5719,TRANSLATED,"But Phoebus watch’d him with a jealous eye,"
5720,TRANSLATED,"Fearing some trick was ever lurking nigh,"
5721,TRANSLATED,"For he would oft, with sudden sly design,"
5722,TRANSLATED,Send forth at once two combatants to join
5723,TRANSLATED,"His warring troops, against the law of arms,               330"
5724,TRANSLATED,Unless the wary foe was ever in alarms.
5725,TRANSLATED,Now the white Archer with his utmost force
5726,TRANSLATED,"Bent the tough bow against the sable Horse,"
5727,TRANSLATED,"And drove him from the Queen, where he had stood"
5728,TRANSLATED,Hoping to glut his vengeance with her blood.               335
5729,TRANSLATED,Then the right Elephant with martial pride
5730,TRANSLATED,"Roved here and there, and spread his terrors wide:"
5731,TRANSLATED,"Glittering in arms from far a courser came,"
5732,TRANSLATED,Threaten’d at once the King and Royal Dame;
5733,TRANSLATED,"Thought himself safe when he the post had seized,          340"
5734,TRANSLATED,And with the future spoils his fancy pleased.
5735,TRANSLATED,"Fired at the danger a young Archer came,"
5736,TRANSLATED,"Rush’d on the foe, and levell’d sure his aim;"
5737,TRANSLATED,"(And though a Pawn his sword in vengeance draws,"
5738,TRANSLATED,Gladly he’d lose his life in glory’s cause).               345
5739,TRANSLATED,"The whistling arrow to his bowels flew,"
5740,TRANSLATED,And the sharp steel his blood profusely drew;
5741,TRANSLATED,"He drops the reins, he totters to the ground,"
5742,TRANSLATED,And his life issued murm’ring through the wound.
5743,TRANSLATED,"Pierced by the Foot, this Archer bit the plain;     |      350"
5744,TRANSLATED,The Foot himself was by another slain;              |
5745,TRANSLATED,"And with inflamed revenge, the battle burns again.  |"
5746,TRANSLATED,"Towers, Archers, Knights, meet on the crimson ground,"
5747,TRANSLATED,And the field echoes to the martial sound.
5748,TRANSLATED,"Their thoughts are heated, and their courage fired,        355"
5749,TRANSLATED,Thick they rush on with double zeal inspired;
5750,TRANSLATED,"Generals and Foot, with different colour’d mien,    |"
5751,TRANSLATED,"Confusedly warring in the camps are seen,—          |"
5752,TRANSLATED,Valour and fortune meet in one promiscuous scene.   |
5753,TRANSLATED,"Now these victorious, lord it o’er the field;              360"
5754,TRANSLATED,"Now the foe rallies, the triumphant yield:"
5755,TRANSLATED,Just as the tide of battle ebbs or flows.
5756,TRANSLATED,As when the conflict more tempestuous grows
5757,TRANSLATED,"Between the winds, with strong and boisterous sweep"
5758,TRANSLATED,They plough th’ Ionian or Atlantic deep!                   365
5759,TRANSLATED,"By turns prevail the mutual blustering roar,"
5760,TRANSLATED,And the big waves alternate lash the shore.
5761,TRANSLATED,But in the midst of all the battle raged
5762,TRANSLATED,"The snowy Queen, with troops at once engaged;"
5763,TRANSLATED,"She fell’d an Archer as she sought the plain,—             370"
5764,TRANSLATED,As she retired an Elephant was slain:
5765,TRANSLATED,"To right and left her fatal spears she sent,"
5766,TRANSLATED,"Burst through the ranks, and triumph’d as she went;"
5767,TRANSLATED,"Through arms and blood she seeks a glorious fate,"
5768,TRANSLATED,"Pierces the farthest lines, and nobly great                375"
5769,TRANSLATED,"Leads on her army with a gallant show,"
5770,TRANSLATED,"Breaks the battalions, and cuts through the foe."
5771,TRANSLATED,"At length the sable King his fears betray’d,"
5772,TRANSLATED,And begg’d his military consort’s aid:
5773,TRANSLATED,"With cheerful speed she flew to his relief,                380"
5774,TRANSLATED,And met in equal arms the female chief.
5775,TRANSLATED,"Who first, great Queen, and who at last did bleed?"
5776,TRANSLATED,How many Whites lay gasping on the mead?
5777,TRANSLATED,"Half dead, and floating in a bloody tide,"
5778,TRANSLATED,"Foot, Knights, and Archer lie on every side.               385"
5779,TRANSLATED,Who can recount the slaughter of the day?
5780,TRANSLATED,How many leaders threw their lives away?
5781,TRANSLATED,"The chequer’d plain is fill’d with dying box,"
5782,TRANSLATED,"Havoc ensues, and with tumultuous shocks"
5783,TRANSLATED,"The different colour’d ranks in blood engage,              390"
5784,TRANSLATED,And Foot and Horse promiscuously rage.
5785,TRANSLATED,With nobler courage and superior might
5786,TRANSLATED,"The dreadful Amazons sustain the fight,"
5787,TRANSLATED,"Resolved alike to mix in glorious strife,"
5788,TRANSLATED,Till to imperious fate they yield their life.              395
5789,TRANSLATED,"Meanwhile each Monarch, in a neighbouring cell,"
5790,TRANSLATED,"Confined the warriors that in battle fell,"
5791,TRANSLATED,"There watch’d the captives with a jealous eye,"
5792,TRANSLATED,"Lest, slipping out again, to arms they fly."
5793,TRANSLATED,"But Thracian Mars, in stedfast friendship join’d           400"
5794,TRANSLATED,"To Hermes, as near Phoebus he reclined,"
5795,TRANSLATED,"Observed each chance, how all their motions bend,"
5796,TRANSLATED,Resolved if possible to serve his friend.
5797,TRANSLATED,He a Foot-soldier and a Knight purloin’d
5798,TRANSLATED,Out from the prison that the dead confined;                405
5799,TRANSLATED,And slyly push’d ’em forward on the plain;               |
5800,TRANSLATED,"Th’ enliven’d combatants their arms regain,              |"
5801,TRANSLATED,"Mix in the bloody scene, and boldly war again.           |"
5802,TRANSLATED,"So the foul hag, in screaming wild alarms"
5803,TRANSLATED,"O’er a dead carcase muttering her charms,                  410"
5804,TRANSLATED,(And with her frequent and tremendous yell
5805,TRANSLATED,Forcing great Hecate from out of hell)
5806,TRANSLATED,Shoots in the corpse a new fictitious soul;              |
5807,TRANSLATED,"With instant glare the supple eyeballs roll,             |"
5808,TRANSLATED,"Again it moves and speaks, and life informs the whole.   | 415"
5809,TRANSLATED,Vulcan alone discern’d the subtle cheat;
5810,TRANSLATED,"And wisely scorning such a base deceit,"
5811,TRANSLATED,Call’d out to Phoebus.  Grief and rage assail
5812,TRANSLATED,Phoebus by turns; detected Mars turns pale.
5813,TRANSLATED,Then awful Jove with sullen eye reproved                   420
5814,TRANSLATED,"Mars, and the captives order’d to be moved"
5815,TRANSLATED,To their dark caves; bid each fictitious spear
5816,TRANSLATED,"Be straight recall’d, and all be as they were."
5817,TRANSLATED,And now both Monarchs with redoubled rage
5818,TRANSLATED,"Led on their Queens, the mutual war to wage.               425"
5819,TRANSLATED,"O’er all the field their thirsty spears they send,"
5820,TRANSLATED,Then front to front their Monarchs they defend.
5821,TRANSLATED,"But lo! the female White rush’d in unseen,"
5822,TRANSLATED,And slew with fatal haste the swarthy Queen;
5823,TRANSLATED,"Yet soon, alas! resign’d her royal spoils,                 430"
5824,TRANSLATED,Snatch’d by a shaft from her successful toils.
5825,TRANSLATED,"Struck at the sight, both hosts in wild surprise"
5826,TRANSLATED,"Pour’d forth their tears, and fill’d the air with cries;"
5827,TRANSLATED,"They wept and sigh’d, as pass’d the fun’ral train,"
5828,TRANSLATED,As if both armies had at once been slain.                  435
5829,TRANSLATED,"And now each troop surrounds its mourning chief,"
5830,TRANSLATED,"To guard his person, or assuage his grief."
5831,TRANSLATED,One is their common fear; one stormy blast
5832,TRANSLATED,Has equally made havoc as it pass’d.
5833,TRANSLATED,"Not all, however, of their youth are slain;                440"
5834,TRANSLATED,Some champions yet the vig’rous war maintain.
5835,TRANSLATED,"Three Foot, an Archer, and a stately Tower,"
5836,TRANSLATED,For Phoebus still exert their utmost power.
5837,TRANSLATED,"Just the same number Mercury can boast,"
5838,TRANSLATED,"Except the Tower, who lately in his post                   445"
5839,TRANSLATED,"Unarm’d inglorious fell, in peace profound,"
5840,TRANSLATED,Pierced by an Archer with a distant wound;
5841,TRANSLATED,"But his right Horse retain’d its mettled pride,—"
5842,TRANSLATED,The rest were swept away by war’s strong tide.
5843,TRANSLATED,"But fretful Hermes, with despairing moan,                450"
5844,TRANSLATED,"Griev’d that so many champions were o’erthrown,"
5845,TRANSLATED,Yet reassumes the fight; and summons round
5846,TRANSLATED,"The little straggling army that he found,—"

5848,TRANSLATED,Resolved with greater caution to engage                    455
5849,TRANSLATED,"In future strife, by subtle wiles (if fate"
5850,TRANSLATED,Should give him leave) to save his sinking state.
5851,TRANSLATED,"The sable troops advance with prudence slow,"
5852,TRANSLATED,Bent on all hazards to distress the foe.
5853,TRANSLATED,"More cheerful Phoebus, with unequal pace,                  460"
5854,TRANSLATED,Rallies his arms to lessen his disgrace.
5855,TRANSLATED,But what strange havoc everywhere has been!        |
5856,TRANSLATED,A straggling champion here and there is seen;      |
5857,TRANSLATED,"And many are the tents, yet few are left within.   |"
5858,TRANSLATED,"Th’ afflicted Kings bewail their consorts dead,          465"
5859,TRANSLATED,And loathe the thoughts of a deserted bed;
5860,TRANSLATED,And though each monarch studies to improve
5861,TRANSLATED,"The tender mem’ry of his former love,"
5862,TRANSLATED,Their state requires a second nuptial tie.
5863,TRANSLATED,Hence the pale ruler with a love-sick eye                  470
5864,TRANSLATED,"Surveys th’ attendants of his former wife,"
5865,TRANSLATED,And offers one of them a royal life.
5866,TRANSLATED,"These, when their martial mistress had been slain,"
5867,TRANSLATED,Weak and despairing tried their arms in vain;
5868,TRANSLATED,"Willing, howe’er, amidst the Black to go,                  475"
5869,TRANSLATED,They thirst for speedy vengeance on the foe.
5870,TRANSLATED,"Then he resolves to see who merits best,"
5871,TRANSLATED,"By strength and courage, the imperial vest;"
5872,TRANSLATED,"Points out the foe, bids each with bold design"
5873,TRANSLATED,"Pierce through the ranks, and reach the deepest line:      480"
5874,TRANSLATED,For none must hope with monarchs to repose
5875,TRANSLATED,"But who can first, through thick surrounding foes,"
5876,TRANSLATED,"Through arms and wiles, with hazardous essay,"
5877,TRANSLATED,Safe to the farthest quarters force their way.
5878,TRANSLATED,"Fired at the thought, with sudden, joyful pace             485"
5879,TRANSLATED,They hurry on; but first of all the race
5880,TRANSLATED,"Runs the third right-hand warrior for the prize,—"
5881,TRANSLATED,The glitt’ring crown already charms her eyes.
5882,TRANSLATED,Her dear associates cheerfully give o’er             |
5883,TRANSLATED,"The nuptial chase; and swift she flies before,       |     490"
5884,TRANSLATED,"And Glory lent her wings, and the reward in store.   |"
5885,TRANSLATED,"Nor would the sable King her hopes prevent,"
5886,TRANSLATED,"For he himself was on a Queen intent,"
5887,TRANSLATED,"Alternate, therefore, through the field they go."
5888,TRANSLATED,"Hermes led on, but by a step too slow,                     495"
5889,TRANSLATED,His fourth left Pawn: and now th’ advent’rous White
5890,TRANSLATED,"Had march’d through all, and gain’d the wish’d for site."
5891,TRANSLATED,Then the pleased King gives orders to prepare
5892,TRANSLATED,"The crown, the sceptre, and the royal chair,"
5893,TRANSLATED,And owns her for his Queen: around exult                   500
5894,TRANSLATED,"The snowy troops, and o’er the Black insult."
5895,TRANSLATED,"Hermes burst into tears,—with fretful roar"
5896,TRANSLATED,"Fill’d the wide air, and his gay vesture tore."
5897,TRANSLATED,The swarthy Foot had only to advance
5898,TRANSLATED,One single step; but oh! malignant chance!                 505
5899,TRANSLATED,"A towered Elephant, with fatal aim,"
5900,TRANSLATED,Stood ready to destroy her when she came:
5901,TRANSLATED,"He keeps a watchful eye upon the whole,"
5902,TRANSLATED,"Threatens her entrance, and protects the goal."
5903,TRANSLATED,"Meanwhile the royal new-created bride,                     510"
5904,TRANSLATED,"Pleased with her pomp, spread death and terror wide;"
5905,TRANSLATED,"Like lightning through the sable troops she flies,"
5906,TRANSLATED,"Clashes her arms, and seems to threat the skies."
5907,TRANSLATED,"The sable troops are sunk in wild affright,"
5908,TRANSLATED,And wish th’ earth op’ning snatch’d ’em from her sight.    515
5909,TRANSLATED,"In burst the Queen, with vast impetuous swing:          |"
5910,TRANSLATED,"The trembling foes come swarming round the King,        |"
5911,TRANSLATED,"Where in the midst he stood, and form a valiant ring.   |"
5912,TRANSLATED,"So the poor cows, straggling o’er pasture land,"
5913,TRANSLATED,"When they perceive the prowling wolf at hand,              520"
5914,TRANSLATED,"Crowd close together in a circle full,"
5915,TRANSLATED,And beg the succour of the lordly bull;
5916,TRANSLATED,"They clash their horns, they low with dreadful sound,"
5917,TRANSLATED,And the remotest groves re-echo round.
5918,TRANSLATED,"But the bold Queen, victorious, from behind              525"
5919,TRANSLATED,Pierces the foe; yet chiefly she design’d
5920,TRANSLATED,"Against the King himself some fatal aim,"
5921,TRANSLATED,And full of war to his pavilion came.
5922,TRANSLATED,"Now here she rush’d, now there; and had she been"
5923,TRANSLATED,"But duly prudent, she had slipp’d between,                 530"
5924,TRANSLATED,"With course oblique, into the fourth white square,"
5925,TRANSLATED,"And the long toil of war had ended there,"
5926,TRANSLATED,"The King had fallen, and all his sable state;"
5927,TRANSLATED,And vanquish’d Hermes cursed his partial fate.
5928,TRANSLATED,"For thence with ease the championess might go,             535"
5929,TRANSLATED,"Murder the King, and none could ward the blow."
5930,TRANSLATED,"With silence, Hermes, and with panting heart,"
5931,TRANSLATED,"Perceived the danger, but with subtle art,"
5932,TRANSLATED,"(Lest he should see the place) spurs on the foe,"
5933,TRANSLATED,"Confounds his thoughts, and blames his being slow.         540"
5934,TRANSLATED,For shame! move on; would you for ever stay?
5935,TRANSLATED,"What sloth is this, what strange perverse delay?—"
5936,TRANSLATED,How could you e’er my little pausing blame?—
5937,TRANSLATED,What! you would wait till night shall end the game?
5938,TRANSLATED,"Phoebus, thus nettled, with imprudence slew                545"
5939,TRANSLATED,"A vulgar Pawn, but lost his nobler view."
5940,TRANSLATED,"Young Hermes leap’d, with sudden joy elate;"
5941,TRANSLATED,"And then, to save the monarch from his fate,"
5942,TRANSLATED,"Led on his martial Knight, who stepp’d between,"
5943,TRANSLATED,Pleased that his charge was to oppose the Queen—           550
5944,TRANSLATED,"Then, pondering how the Indian beast to slay,"
5945,TRANSLATED,"That stopp’d the Foot from making farther way,—"
5946,TRANSLATED,From being made a Queen; with slanting aim
5947,TRANSLATED,"An archer struck him; down the monster came,"
5948,TRANSLATED,And dying shook the earth: while Phoebus tries             555
5949,TRANSLATED,Without success the monarch to surprise.
5950,TRANSLATED,"The Foot, then uncontroll’d with instant pride,"
5951,TRANSLATED,"Seized the last spot, and moved a royal bride."
5952,TRANSLATED,"And now with equal strength both war again,"
5953,TRANSLATED,And bring their second wives upon the plain;               560
5954,TRANSLATED,"Then, though with equal views each hop’d and fear’d,"
5955,TRANSLATED,"Yet, as if every doubt had disappear’d,"
5956,TRANSLATED,"As if he had the palm, young Hermes flies"
5957,TRANSLATED,"Into excess of joy; with deep disguise,"
5958,TRANSLATED,"Extols his own Black troops, with frequent spite           565"
5959,TRANSLATED,And with invective taunts disdains the White.
5960,TRANSLATED,Whom Phoebus thus reproved with quick return—
5961,TRANSLATED,As yet we cannot the decision learn
5962,TRANSLATED,"Of this dispute, and do you triumph now?"
5963,TRANSLATED,"Then your big words and vauntings I’ll allow,              570"
5964,TRANSLATED,When you the battle shall completely gain;
5965,TRANSLATED,At present I shall make your boasting vain.
5966,TRANSLATED,"He said, and forward led the daring Queen;"
5967,TRANSLATED,Instant the fury of the bloody scene
5968,TRANSLATED,"Rises tumultuous, swift the warriors fly                   575"
5969,TRANSLATED,From either side to conquer or to die.
5970,TRANSLATED,"They front the storm of war: around ’em Fear,"
5971,TRANSLATED,"Terror, and Death, perpetually appear."
5972,TRANSLATED,"All meet in arms, and man to man oppose,"
5973,TRANSLATED,Each from their camp attempts to drive their foes;         580
5974,TRANSLATED,Each tries by turns to force the hostile lines;
5975,TRANSLATED,Chance and impatience blast their best designs.
5976,TRANSLATED,The sable Queen spread terror as she went
5977,TRANSLATED,Through the mid ranks: with more reserved intent
5978,TRANSLATED,"The adverse dame declined the open fray,                   585"
5979,TRANSLATED,And to the King in private stole away:
5980,TRANSLATED,"Then took the royal guard, and bursting in,"
5981,TRANSLATED,With fatal menace close besieged the King.
5982,TRANSLATED,"Alarm’d at this, the swarthy Queen, in haste,"
5983,TRANSLATED,From all her havoc and destructive waste                   590
5984,TRANSLATED,"Broke off, and her contempt of death to show,          |"
5985,TRANSLATED,"Leap’d in between the Monarch and the foe,             |"
5986,TRANSLATED,To save the King and state from this impending blow.   |
5987,TRANSLATED,But Phoebus met a worse misfortune here:
5988,TRANSLATED,"For Hermes now led forward, void of fear,                  595"
5989,TRANSLATED,"His furious Horse into the open plain,"
5990,TRANSLATED,"That onward chafed, and pranced, and pawed amain."
5991,TRANSLATED,Nor ceased from his attempts until he stood
5992,TRANSLATED,"On the long-wished-for spot, from whence he could"
5993,TRANSLATED,"Slay King or Queen.  O’erwhelm’d with sudden fears,        600"
5994,TRANSLATED,"Apollo saw, and could not keep from tears."
5995,TRANSLATED,Now all seem’d ready to be overthrown;
5996,TRANSLATED,"His strength was wither’d, ev’ry hope was flown."
5997,TRANSLATED,"Hermes, exulting at this great surprise,"
5998,TRANSLATED,"Shouted for joy, and fill’d the air with cries;            605"
5999,TRANSLATED,"Instant he sent the Queen to shades below,"
6000,TRANSLATED,And of her spoils made a triumphant show.
6001,TRANSLATED,"But in return, and in his mid career,"
6002,TRANSLATED,"Fell his brave Knight, beneath the Monarch’s spear."
6003,TRANSLATED,"Phoebus, however, did not yet despair,                   610"
6004,TRANSLATED,But still fought on with courage and with care.
6005,TRANSLATED,"He had but two poor common men to show,"
6006,TRANSLATED,And Mars’s favourite with his iv’ry bow.
6007,TRANSLATED,The thoughts of ruin made ’em dare their best
6008,TRANSLATED,"To save their King, so fatally distress’d.                 615"
6009,TRANSLATED,But the sad hour required not such an aid;
6010,TRANSLATED,And Hermes breathed revenge where’er he stray’d.
6011,TRANSLATED,"Fierce comes the sable Queen with fatal threat,"
6012,TRANSLATED,Surrounds the Monarch in his royal seat;
6013,TRANSLATED,"Rushed here and there, nor rested till she slew            620"
6014,TRANSLATED,The last remainder of the whiten’d crew.
6015,TRANSLATED,"Sole stood the King, the midst of all the plain,"
6016,TRANSLATED,"Weak and defenceless, his companions slain."
6017,TRANSLATED,As when the ruddy morn ascending high
6018,TRANSLATED,"Has chased the twinkling stars from all the sky,           625"
6019,TRANSLATED,"Your star, fair Venus, still retains its light,"
6020,TRANSLATED,"And, loveliest, goes the latest out of sight."
6021,TRANSLATED,"No safety’s left, no gleams of hope remain;"
6022,TRANSLATED,"Yet did he not as vanquish’d quit the plain,"
6023,TRANSLATED,"But tried to shut himself between the foe,—          |     630"
6024,TRANSLATED,"Unhurt through swords and spears he hoped to go,     |"
6025,TRANSLATED,Until no room was left to shun the fatal blow.       |
6026,TRANSLATED,"For if none threaten’d his immediate fate,"
6027,TRANSLATED,"And his next move must ruin all his state,"
6028,TRANSLATED,"All their past toil and labour is in vain,           |     635"
6029,TRANSLATED,"Vain all the bloody carnage of the plain,—           |"
6030,TRANSLATED,"Neither would triumph then, the laurel neither gain. |"
6031,TRANSLATED,"Therefore through each void space and desert tent,"
6032,TRANSLATED,By different moves his various course he bent:
6033,TRANSLATED,"The Black King watch’d him with observant eye,             640"
6034,TRANSLATED,"Follow’d him close, but left him room to fly."
6035,TRANSLATED,"Then when he saw him take the farthest line,"
6036,TRANSLATED,"He sent the Queen his motions to confine,"
6037,TRANSLATED,"And guard the second rank, that he could go"
6038,TRANSLATED,No farther now than to that distant row.                   645
6039,TRANSLATED,The sable monarch then with cheerful mien
6040,TRANSLATED,"Approach’d, but always with one space between."
6041,TRANSLATED,"But as the King stood o’er against him there,"
6042,TRANSLATED,"Helpless, forlorn, and sunk in his despair,"
6043,TRANSLATED,"The martial Queen her lucky moment knew,          |        650"
6044,TRANSLATED,"Seized on the farthest seat with fatal view,      |"
6045,TRANSLATED,Nor left th’ unhappy King a place to flee unto.   |
6046,TRANSLATED,"At length in vengeance her keen sword she draws,    |"
6047,TRANSLATED,"Slew him, and ended thus the bloody cause:          |"
6048,TRANSLATED,And all the gods around approved it with applause.  |      655
6049,TRANSLATED,"The victor could not from his insults keep,"
6050,TRANSLATED,But laugh’d and sneer’d to see Apollo weep.
6051,TRANSLATED,"Jove call’d him near, and gave him in his hand"
6052,TRANSLATED,"The powerful, happy, and mysterious wand"
6053,TRANSLATED,"By which the Shades are call’d to purer day,               660"
6054,TRANSLATED,When penal fire has purged their sins away;
6055,TRANSLATED,By which the guilty are condemn’d to dwell
6056,TRANSLATED,In the dark mansions of the deepest hell;
6057,TRANSLATED,"By which he gives us sleep, or sleep denies,"
6058,TRANSLATED,And closes at the last the dying eyes.                     665
6059,TRANSLATED,"Soon after this, the heavenly victor brought"
6060,TRANSLATED,"The game on earth, and first th’ Italians taught."
6061,TRANSLATED,For (as they say) fair Scacchis he espied
6062,TRANSLATED,"Feeding her cygnets in the silver tide,"
6063,TRANSLATED,"(Sacchis, the loveliest Seriad of the place)               670"
6064,TRANSLATED,"And as she stray’d, took her to his embrace."
6065,TRANSLATED,"Then, to reward her for her virtue lost,"
6066,TRANSLATED,"Gave her the men and chequer’d board, emboss’d"
6067,TRANSLATED,With gold and silver curiously inlay’d;
6068,TRANSLATED,And taught her how the game was to be play’d.              675
6069,TRANSLATED,Ev’n now ’tis honour’d with her happy name;
6070,TRANSLATED,And Rome and all the world admire the game.

6184,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,No collected edition of Goldsmith’s poetical works appeared until after
6185,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"his death. But, in 1775, W. Griffin, who had published the _Essays_"
6186,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"of ten years earlier, issued a volume entitled _The Miscellaneous"
6187,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"Works of Oliver Goldsmith, M.B., containing all his Essays and Poems_."
6188,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"The ‘poems’ however were confined to ‘The Traveller,’ ‘The Deserted"
6189,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"Village,’ ‘Edwin and Angelina,’ ‘The Double Transformation,’ ‘A New"
6190,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"Simile,’ and ‘Retaliation,’—an obviously imperfect harvesting. In"
6191,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"the following year G. Kearsly printed an eighth edition of _Retaliation_,"
6192,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"with which he included ‘The Hermit’ (‘Edwin and Angelina’), ‘The Gift,’"
6193,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"‘Madam Blaize,’ and the epilogues to _The Sister_ and _She"
6194,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,stoops to Conquer_;* while to an edition of _The Haunch of
6195,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"Venison_, also put forth in 1776, he added the ‘Epitaph on Parnell’"
6196,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,and two songs from the oratorio of _The Captivity_. The next
6197,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,collection appeared in a volume of _Poems and Plays_ published
6198,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"at Dublin in 1777, where it was preceded by a ‘Life,’ written by W."
6199,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"Glover, one of Goldsmith’s ‘Irish clients.’ Then, in 1780, came vol. i of"
6200,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"T. Evans’s _ Poetical and Dramatic Works, etc., now first collected_,"
6201,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"also having a ‘Memoir,’ and certainly fuller than anything which had gone"
6202,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"before. Next followed the long-deferred _Miscellaneous Works,_"
6203,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"etc., of 1801, in four volumes, vol. ii of which comprised the plays and"
6204,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"poems. Prefixed to this edition is the important biographical sketch,"
6205,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"compiled under the direction of Bishop Percy, and usually described as the"
6206,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"_Percy Memoir_, by which title it is referred to in the ensuing"
6207,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,notes. The next memorable edition was that edited for the Aldine Series in
6208,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"1831, by the Rev. John Mitford. Prior and Wright’s edition in vol. iv of"
6209,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"the _Miscellaneous Works_, etc., of 1837, comes after this;"
6210,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,then Bolton Corney’s excellent _Poetical Works_ of 1845; and
6211,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"vol. i of Peter Cunningham’s _Works_, etc. of 1854. There are"
6212,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"other issues of the poems, the latest of which is to be found in vol. ii"

6226,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"in Cunningham’s notes are here transferred to Prior, some of Prior’s to"
6227,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"Mitford, and so forth. As regards the notes themselves, care has been"
6228,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"taken to make them full enough to obviate the necessity, except in rare"
6229,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,"instances, of further investigation. It is the editor’s experience that"

6234,EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.,* In this connexion may be recalled the dictum of Hume quoted by Dr.

6245,THE TRAVELLER.,It was on those continental wanderings which occupied Goldsmith between
6246,THE TRAVELLER.,"February, 1755 and February, 1756 that he conceived his first idea of"
6247,THE TRAVELLER.,"this, the earliest of his poems to which he prefixed his name; and he"
6248,THE TRAVELLER.,"probably had in mind Addison’s _Letter from Italy to Lord Halifax_,"
6249,THE TRAVELLER.,"a work in which he found ‘a strain of political thinking that was, at that"
6250,THE TRAVELLER.,"time [1701]. new in our poetry.’ (_Beauties of English Poesy_,"
6251,THE TRAVELLER.,"1767, i. III). From the dedicatory letter to his brother—which says"
6252,THE TRAVELLER.,"expressly, ‘as a part of this Poem was formerly written to you from"
6253,THE TRAVELLER.,"Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only inscribed"
6254,THE TRAVELLER.,to you’—it is plain that some portion of it must have been actually
6255,THE TRAVELLER.,"composed abroad. It was not, however, actually published until the 19th of"
6256,THE TRAVELLER.,"December, 1764, and the title-page bore the date of 1765.* The publisher"
6257,THE TRAVELLER.,"was John Newbery, of St. Paul’s Churchyard, and the price of the book, a"
6258,THE TRAVELLER.,"quarto of 30 pages, was 1s. 6d. A second, third and fourth edition quickly"
6259,THE TRAVELLER.,"followed, and a ninth, from which it is here reprinted, was issued in"
6260,THE TRAVELLER.,"1774, the year of the author’s death. Between the first and the sixth"
6261,THE TRAVELLER.,"edition of 1770 there were numerous alterations, the more important of"
6262,THE TRAVELLER.,which are indicated in the ensuing notes.
6263,THE TRAVELLER.,
6264,THE TRAVELLER.,
6265,THE TRAVELLER.,* This is the generally recognized first edition. But the late Mr.
6266,THE TRAVELLER.,"Frederick Locker Lampson, the poet and collector, possessed a quarto copy,"
6267,THE TRAVELLER.,"dated 1764, which had no author’s name, and in which the dedication ran as"
6268,THE TRAVELLER.,"follows:—‘This poem is inscribed to the Rev. Henry Goldsmith, M.A."
6269,THE TRAVELLER.,"By his most affectionate Brother Oliver Goldsmith.’ It was, in all"
6270,THE TRAVELLER.,"probability, unique, though it is alleged that there are octavo copies"
6271,THE TRAVELLER.,which present similar characteristics. It has now gone to America with the
6272,THE TRAVELLER.,Rowfant Library.
6273,THE TRAVELLER.,
6274,THE TRAVELLER.,"In 1902 an interesting discovery was made by Mr. Bertram Dobell, to"
6275,THE TRAVELLER.,whom the public are indebted for so many important literary ‘finds.’ In a
6276,THE TRAVELLER.,parcel of pamphlets he came upon a number of loose printed leaves entitled
6277,THE TRAVELLER.,_A Prospect of Society_. They obviously belonged to _The
6278,THE TRAVELLER.,"Traveller_; but seemed to be its ‘formless unarranged material,’ and"
6279,THE TRAVELLER.,contained many variations from the text of the first edition. Mr. Dobell’s
6280,THE TRAVELLER.,"impression was that ‘the author’s manuscript, written on loose leaves, had"
6281,THE TRAVELLER.,"fallen into confusion, and was then printed without any attempt at"
6282,THE TRAVELLER.,re-arrangement.’ This was near the mark; but the complete solution of the
6283,THE TRAVELLER.,riddle was furnished by Mr. Quiller Couch in an article in the _Daily
6284,THE TRAVELLER.,"News_ for March 31, 1902, since recast in his charming volume _From"
6285,THE TRAVELLER.,"a Cornish Window_, 1906, pp. 86–92. He showed conclusively that"
6286,THE TRAVELLER.,_The Prospect_ was ‘merely an early draft of _The
6287,THE TRAVELLER.,Traveller_ printed backwards in fairly regular sections.’ What had
6288,THE TRAVELLER.,"manifestly happened was this. Goldsmith, turning over each page as"
6289,THE TRAVELLER.,"written, had laid it on the top of the preceding page of MS. and forgotten"
6290,THE TRAVELLER.,"to rearrange them when done. Thus the series of pages were reversed; and,"
6291,THE TRAVELLER.,"so reversed, were set up in type by a matter-of-fact compositor. Mr."
6292,THE TRAVELLER.,Dobell at once accepted this happy explanation; which—as Mr. Quiller
6293,THE TRAVELLER.,Couch points out—has the advantage of being a ‘blunder just so
6294,THE TRAVELLER.,natural to Goldsmith as to be almost postulable.’ One or two of the
6295,THE TRAVELLER.,"variations of Mr. Dobell’s ‘find’—variations, it should be added,"
6296,THE TRAVELLER.,antecedent to the first edition—are noted in their places.
6297,THE TRAVELLER.,
6298,THE TRAVELLER.,The didactic purpose of _The Traveller_ is defined in the
6299,THE TRAVELLER.,"concluding paragraph of the _Dedication_; and, like many of the"
6300,THE TRAVELLER.,"thoughts which it contains, had been anticipated in a passage"
6301,THE TRAVELLER.,"of _The Citizen of the World_, 1762, i. 185:—‘Every mind"
6302,THE TRAVELLER.,"seems capable of entertaining a certain quantity of happiness, which no"
6303,THE TRAVELLER.,"institutions can encrease, no circumstances alter, and entirely"
6304,THE TRAVELLER.,independent on fortune.’ But the best short description of the poem is
6305,THE TRAVELLER.,"Macaulay’s:—‘In the _Traveller_ the execution, though"
6306,THE TRAVELLER.,"deserving of much praise, is far inferior to the design. No philosophical"
6307,THE TRAVELLER.,"poem, ancient or modern, has a plan so noble, and at the same time so"
6308,THE TRAVELLER.,"simple. An English wanderer, seated on a crag among the Alps, near the"
6309,THE TRAVELLER.,"point where three great countries meet, looks down on the boundless"
6310,THE TRAVELLER.,"prospect, reviews his long pilgrimage, recalls the varieties of scenery,"
6311,THE TRAVELLER.,"of climate, of government, of religion, of national character, which he"
6312,THE TRAVELLER.,"has observed, and comes to the conclusion, just or unjust, that our"
6313,THE TRAVELLER.,"happiness depends little on political institutions, and much on the temper"
6314,THE TRAVELLER.,"and regulation of our own minds.’ (_Encyclop. Britannica_,"
6315,THE TRAVELLER.,"Goldsmith, February, 1856.)"
6316,THE TRAVELLER.,
6317,THE TRAVELLER.,The only definite record of payment for _ The Traveller_ is
6318,THE TRAVELLER.,"‘Copy of the Traveller, a Poem, 21_l_,’ in Newbery’s MSS.; but as the"
6319,THE TRAVELLER.,"same sum occurs in Memoranda of much later date than 1764, it is possible"
6320,THE TRAVELLER.,that the success of the book may have prompted some supplementary fee.
6321,THE TRAVELLER.,
6322,THE TRAVELLER.,"A Prospect, i.e. ‘a view.’ ‘I went to Putney, and"
6323,THE TRAVELLER.,"other places on the Thames, to take ‘prospects’ in crayon, to carry into"
6324,THE TRAVELLER.,"France, where I thought to have them engraved’ (Evelyn, _Diary_,"
6325,THE TRAVELLER.,"20th June, 1649). And Reynolds uses the word of Claude in his Fourth"
6326,THE TRAVELLER.,Discourse:—‘His pictures are a composition of the various draughts
6327,THE TRAVELLER.,which he had previously made from various beautiful scenes and prospects’
6328,THE TRAVELLER.,"(_Works_, by Malone, 1798, i. 105). The word is common on old"
6329,THE TRAVELLER.,"prints, e.g. _An Exact Prospect of the Magnificent Stone Bridge at"
6330,THE TRAVELLER.,"Westminster_, etc., 1751."
6331,THE TRAVELLER.,
6332,THE TRAVELLER.,"Dedication. The Rev. Henry Goldsmith, says the"
6333,THE TRAVELLER.,"Percy _ Memoir_, 1801, p. 3, ‘had distinguished himself both at"
6334,THE TRAVELLER.,"school and at college, but he unfortunately married at the early age of"
6335,THE TRAVELLER.,"nineteen; which confined him to a Curacy, and prevented his rising to"
6336,THE TRAVELLER.,preferment in the church.’
6337,THE TRAVELLER.,
6338,THE TRAVELLER.,with an income of forty pounds a year. Cf. _The
6339,THE TRAVELLER.,"Deserted Village_, ll. 141–2:—"
6340,THE TRAVELLER.,
6341,THE TRAVELLER.,
6342,THE TRAVELLER.,"A man he was, to all the country dear,"
6343,THE TRAVELLER.,
6344,THE TRAVELLER.,And passing rich with _forty pounds a year_.
6345,THE TRAVELLER.,
6346,THE TRAVELLER.,
6347,THE TRAVELLER.,"Cf. also Parson Adams in ch. iii of _Joseph Andrews_, who has"
6348,THE TRAVELLER.,"twenty-three; and Mr. Rivers, in the _Spiritual Quixote_,"
6349,THE TRAVELLER.,1772:—‘I do not choose to go into orders to be a curate all my
6350,THE TRAVELLER.,"life-time, and work for about fifteen-pence a day, or twenty-five pounds"
6351,THE TRAVELLER.,"a year’ (bk. vi, ch. xvii). Dr. Primrose’s stipend is thirty-five in the"
6352,THE TRAVELLER.,"first instance, fifteen in the second (_Vicar of Wakefield_,"
6353,THE TRAVELLER.,"chapters ii and iii). But Professor Hales (_Longer English Poems_,"
6354,THE TRAVELLER.,"1885, p. 351) supplies an exact parallel in the case of Churchill, who, he"
6355,THE TRAVELLER.,"says, when a curate at Rainham, ‘prayed and starved on _ forty pounds a"
6356,THE TRAVELLER.,"year_.’ The latter words are Churchill’s own, and sound like a"
6357,THE TRAVELLER.,quotation; but he was dead long before _The Deserted Village_
6358,THE TRAVELLER.,appeared in 1770. There is an interesting paper in the _Gentleman’s
6359,THE TRAVELLER.,"Magazine_ for November, 1763, on the miseries and hardships of the"
6360,THE TRAVELLER.,‘inferior clergy.’
6361,THE TRAVELLER.,
6362,THE TRAVELLER.,"But of all kinds of ambition, etc. In the first"
6363,THE TRAVELLER.,"edition of 1765, p. ii, this passage was as follows:—‘But of all"
6364,THE TRAVELLER.,"kinds of ambition, as things are now circumstanced, perhaps that which"
6365,THE TRAVELLER.,"pursues poetical fame, is the wildest. What from the encreased refinement"
6366,THE TRAVELLER.,"of the times, from the diversity of judgments produced by opposing systems"
6367,THE TRAVELLER.,"of criticism, and from the more prevalent divisions of opinion influenced"
6368,THE TRAVELLER.,"by party, the strongest and happiest efforts can expect to please but in a"
6369,THE TRAVELLER.,very narrow circle. Though the poet were as sure of his aim as the
6370,THE TRAVELLER.,"imperial archer of antiquity, who boasted that he never missed the heart;"
6371,THE TRAVELLER.,"yet would many of his shafts now fly at random, for the heart is too often"
6372,THE TRAVELLER.,in the wrong place.’ In the second edition it was curtailed; in the sixth
6373,THE TRAVELLER.,it took its final form.
6374,THE TRAVELLER.,
6375,THE TRAVELLER.,they engross all that favour once shown to her.
6376,THE TRAVELLER.,First version—‘They engross all favour to themselves.’

6379,THE TRAVELLER.,"compares Dryden’s epistle _To Sir Godfrey Kneller_, II. 89–92:—"

6388,THE TRAVELLER.,"Has seized the blessing first, like Jacob’s race."
6389,THE TRAVELLER.,
6390,THE TRAVELLER.,_Party_=faction. Cf. lines 31–2 on Edmund Burke in

6392,THE TRAVELLER.,
6393,THE TRAVELLER.,
6394,THE TRAVELLER.,"Who, born for the Universe, narrow’d his mind,"
6395,THE TRAVELLER.,
6396,THE TRAVELLER.,And to _party_ gave up what was meant for mankind.
6397,THE TRAVELLER.,
6398,THE TRAVELLER.,"Such readers generally admire, etc. ‘I suppose this"
6399,THE TRAVELLER.,"paragraph to be directed against Paul Whitehead, or Churchill,’ writes"
6400,THE TRAVELLER.,"Mitford. It was clearly aimed at Churchill, since Prior (_Life_,"
6401,THE TRAVELLER.,"1837, ii. 54) quotes a portion of a contemporary article in the _St."
6402,THE TRAVELLER.,"James’s Chronicle_ for February 7–9, 1765, attributed to Bonnell"
6403,THE TRAVELLER.,"Thornton, which leaves little room for doubt upon the question. ‘The"
6404,THE TRAVELLER.,"latter part of this paragraph,’ says the writer, referring to the passage"
6405,THE TRAVELLER.,"now annotated, ‘we cannot help considering as a reflection on the memory"
6406,THE TRAVELLER.,"of the late Mr. Churchill, whose talents as a poet were so greatly and so"
6407,THE TRAVELLER.,"deservedly admired, that during his short reign, his merit in great"
6408,THE TRAVELLER.,measure eclipsed that of others; and we think it no mean acknowledgment of
6409,THE TRAVELLER.,"the excellencies of this poem [_The Traveller_] to say that,"
6410,THE TRAVELLER.,"like the stars, they appear the more brilliant now that the sun of our"
6411,THE TRAVELLER.,"poetry is gone down.’ Churchill died on the 4th of November, 1764, some"
6412,THE TRAVELLER.,"weeks before the publication of _The Traveller_. His powers, it"
6413,THE TRAVELLER.,"may be, were misdirected and misapplied; but his rough vigour and his"
6414,THE TRAVELLER.,manly verse deserved a better fate at Goldsmith’s hands.
6415,THE TRAVELLER.,
6416,THE TRAVELLER.,tawdry was added in the sixth edition of 1770.
6417,THE TRAVELLER.,
6418,THE TRAVELLER.,blank verse. Cf. _The Present State of Polite
6419,THE TRAVELLER.,"Learning_, 1759, p. 150—‘From a desire in the critic of"
6420,THE TRAVELLER.,"grafting the spirit of ancient languages upon the English, has proceeded"
6421,THE TRAVELLER.,"of late several disagreeable instances of pedantry. Among the number, I"
6422,THE TRAVELLER.,think we may reckon _blank verse_. Nothing but the greatest sublimity
6423,THE TRAVELLER.,"of subject can render such a measure pleasing; however, we now see it used"
6424,THE TRAVELLER.,on the most trivial occasions’—by which last remark Goldsmith
6425,THE TRAVELLER.,"probably, as Cunningham thinks, intended to refer to the efforts of"
6426,THE TRAVELLER.,"Akenside, Dyer, and Armstrong. His views upon blank verse were shared by"
6427,THE TRAVELLER.,"Johnson and Gray. At the date of the present dedication, the latest"
6428,THE TRAVELLER.,offender in this way had been Goldsmith’s old colleague on _The
6429,THE TRAVELLER.,"Monthly Review_, Dr. James Grainger, author of _The Sugar Cane_,"
6430,THE TRAVELLER.,"which was published in June, 1764. (Cf. also _The Bee_ for 24th"
6431,THE TRAVELLER.,"November, 1759, ‘An account of the Augustan Age of England.’)"
6432,THE TRAVELLER.,

6434,THE TRAVELLER.,"this read—‘and that this principle in each state, and in our own in"
6435,THE TRAVELLER.,"particular, may be carried to a mischievous excess.’"
6436,THE TRAVELLER.,
6437,THE TRAVELLER.,"Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow. Mitford"
6438,THE TRAVELLER.,"(Aldine edition, 1831, p. 7) compares the following lines from Ovid:—"

6448,THE TRAVELLER.,
6449,THE TRAVELLER.,slow. A well-known passage from Boswell must here be
6450,THE TRAVELLER.,"reproduced:—‘Chamier once asked him [Goldsmith], what he meant by _slow_,"
6451,THE TRAVELLER.,"the last word in the first line of _The Traveller_,"
6452,THE TRAVELLER.,
6453,THE TRAVELLER.,

6455,THE TRAVELLER.,
6456,THE TRAVELLER.,
6457,THE TRAVELLER.,"Did he mean tardiness of locomotion? Goldsmith, who would say something"
6458,THE TRAVELLER.,"without consideration, answered “yes.” I [Johnson] was sitting by, and"
6459,THE TRAVELLER.,"said, “No, Sir, you do not mean tardiness of locomotion; you mean, that"
6460,THE TRAVELLER.,sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude.” Chamier believed
6461,THE TRAVELLER.,then that I had written the line as much as if he had seen me write it.’
6462,THE TRAVELLER.,"[Birkbeck Hill’s _Boswell_, 1887, iii. 252–3.) It is quite"
6463,THE TRAVELLER.,"possible, however, that Goldsmith meant no more than he said."
6464,THE TRAVELLER.,
6465,THE TRAVELLER.,"the rude Carinthian boor. ‘Carinthia,’ says"
6466,THE TRAVELLER.,"Cunningham, ‘was visited by Goldsmith in 1755, and still (1853) retains"
6467,THE TRAVELLER.,its character for inhospitality.’
6468,THE TRAVELLER.,
6469,THE TRAVELLER.,"Campania. ‘Intended,’ says Bolton Corney, ‘to denote"

6472,THE TRAVELLER.,
6473,THE TRAVELLER.,a lengthening chain. Prior compares Letter iii of
6474,THE TRAVELLER.,"_The Citizen of the World_, 1762, i. 5:—‘The farther I"

6476,THE TRAVELLER.,"bind me to my native country, and you, are still unbroken. By every"
6477,THE TRAVELLER.,"remove, I only drag a greater length of chain.’ But, as Mitford points"
6478,THE TRAVELLER.,"out, Cibber has a similar thought in his _Comical Lovers_,"
6479,THE TRAVELLER.,"1707, Act v:—‘When I am with Florimel, it [my heart] is still your"
6480,THE TRAVELLER.,"prisoner, _it only draws a longer chain after it_.’ And earlier still"
6481,THE TRAVELLER.,"in Dryden’s ‘All for Love’, 1678, Act ii, Sc. 1:—"

6635,THE TRAVELLER.,Goldsmith’s shoulder at the writing on his desk. It seemed to be some

6725,THE TRAVELLER.,"Goldsmith, if we may trust George Colman’s _Prologue_ to Miss"

6861,THE TRAVELLER.,"Mr. Forster thinks (_Life_, 1871, i. 375) that Goldsmith"

6911,THE TRAVELLER.,"an entirely different couplet to that in the text, and certainly more"
6912,THE TRAVELLER.,"logical. (Dobell’s _Prospect of Society_, 1902, pp. xi, 2, and"
6913,THE TRAVELLER.,"Notes, v, vi). Mr. Dobell plausibly suggests that this Tory substitution"
6914,THE TRAVELLER.,is due to Johnson.
6915,THE TRAVELLER.,
6916,THE TRAVELLER.,"Have we not seen, etc. These lines contain the"
6917,THE TRAVELLER.,first idea of the subsequent poem of _The Deserted Village_ (_q.v._).
6918,THE TRAVELLER.,
6919,THE TRAVELLER.,Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around. The
6920,THE TRAVELLER.,Oswego is a river which runs between Lakes Oneida and Ontario. In the
6921,THE TRAVELLER.,"_Threnodia Augustalis_, 1772, Goldsmith writes:—"

6924,THE TRAVELLER.,Oswego’s dreary shores shall be my grave.
6925,THE TRAVELLER.,

6933,THE TRAVELLER.,
6934,THE TRAVELLER.,"pensive exile. This, in the version mentioned in"
6935,THE TRAVELLER.,"the next note, was ‘famish’d exile.’"
6936,THE TRAVELLER.,
6937,THE TRAVELLER.,"To stop too fearful, and too faint to go. This"
6938,THE TRAVELLER.,"line, upon Boswell’s authority, is claimed for Johnson (Birkbeck Hill’s"
6939,THE TRAVELLER.,"_ Boswell_, 1887, ii. 6). Goldsmith’s original ran:—"
6940,THE TRAVELLER.,
6941,THE TRAVELLER.,
6942,THE TRAVELLER.,"And faintly fainter, fainter seems to go."
6943,THE TRAVELLER.,
6944,THE TRAVELLER.,
6945,THE TRAVELLER.,"(Dobell’s _Prospect of Society_, 1902, p. 3)."
6946,THE TRAVELLER.,
6947,THE TRAVELLER.,"How small, of all, etc. Johnson wrote these"
6948,THE TRAVELLER.,concluding
6949,THE TRAVELLER.,ten lines with the exception of the penultimate couplet. They and line 420
6950,THE TRAVELLER.,were all—he told Boswell—of which he could be sure (Birkbeck
6951,THE TRAVELLER.,"Hill’s _Boswell_, _ut supra_). Like Goldsmith, he"
6952,THE TRAVELLER.,sometimes worked his prose ideas into his verse. The first couplet is
6953,THE TRAVELLER.,"apparently a reminiscence of a passage in his own _Rasselas_,"
6954,THE TRAVELLER.,"1759, ii. 112, where the astronomer speaks of ‘the task of a king . . ."
6955,THE TRAVELLER.,"who has the care only of a few millions, to whom he cannot do much good or"
6956,THE TRAVELLER.,"harm.’ (Grant’s _Johnson_, 1887, p. 89.) ‘I would not give half"
6957,THE TRAVELLER.,"a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another,’ he"
6958,THE TRAVELLER.,"told that ‘vile Whig,’ Sir Adam Fergusson, in 1772. ‘It is of no moment to"
6959,THE TRAVELLER.,"the happiness of an individual’ (Birkbeck Hill’s _ Boswell_,"
6960,THE TRAVELLER.,"1887, ii. 170)."
6961,THE TRAVELLER.,
6962,THE TRAVELLER.,The lifted axe. Mitford here recalls Blackmore’s
6963,THE TRAVELLER.,
6964,THE TRAVELLER.,
6965,THE TRAVELLER.,"Some the sharp axe, and some the painful wheel."
6966,THE TRAVELLER.,
6967,THE TRAVELLER.,"The ‘lifted axe’ he also traces to Young and Blackmore, with both of whom"
6968,THE TRAVELLER.,Goldsmith seems to have been familiar; but it is surely not necessary to
6969,THE TRAVELLER.,assume that he borrowed from either in this instance.
6970,THE TRAVELLER.,
6971,THE TRAVELLER.,"Luke’s iron crown. George and Luke Dosa, or Doscha,"
6972,THE TRAVELLER.,headed a rebellion in Hungary in 1513. The former was proclaimed king by
6973,THE TRAVELLER.,"the peasants; and, in consequence suffered, among other things, the"
6974,THE TRAVELLER.,torture of the red-hot iron crown. Such a punishment took place at
6975,THE TRAVELLER.,"Bordeaux when Montaigne was seventeen (Morley’s Florio’s _ Montaigne_,"
6976,THE TRAVELLER.,"1886, p. xvi). Much ink has been shed over Goldsmith’s lapse of ‘Luke’ for"
6977,THE TRAVELLER.,"George. In the book which he cited as his authority, the family name of"
6978,THE TRAVELLER.,"the brothers was given as Zeck,—hence Bolton Corney, in his edition"
6979,THE TRAVELLER.,"of the _ Poetical Works_, 1845, p. 36, corrected the line to—"
6980,THE TRAVELLER.,
6981,THE TRAVELLER.,
6982,THE TRAVELLER.,"_Zeck’s_ iron crown, etc.,"
6983,THE TRAVELLER.,
6984,THE TRAVELLER.,
6985,THE TRAVELLER.,an alteration which has been adopted by other editors. (See also Forster’s
6986,THE TRAVELLER.,"_Life_, 1871, i. 370.)"
6987,THE TRAVELLER.,
6988,THE TRAVELLER.,"Damien’s bed of steel. Robert-Francois Damiens,"
6989,THE TRAVELLER.,1714–57. Goldsmith writes ‘Damien’s.’ In the _Gentlemen’s Magazine_
6990,THE TRAVELLER.,"for 1757, vol. xxvii. pp. 87 and 151, where there is an account of this"
6991,THE TRAVELLER.,poor half-witted wretch’s torture and execution for attempting to
6992,THE TRAVELLER.,"assassinate Louis XV, the name is thus spelled, as also in other"
6993,THE TRAVELLER.,contemporary records and caricatures. The following passage explains the
6994,THE TRAVELLER.,‘bed of steel’:—‘Being conducted
6995,THE TRAVELLER.,"to the Conciergerie, an ‘iron bed’, which likewise served for a chair, was"
6996,THE TRAVELLER.,"prepared for him, and to this he was fastened with chains. The torture was"
6997,THE TRAVELLER.,"again applied, and a physician ordered to attend to see what degree of"
6998,THE TRAVELLER.,"pain he could support,’ etc. (Smollett’s _History of England_,"
6999,THE TRAVELLER.,"1823, bk. iii, ch. 7, § xxv.) Goldsmith’s own explanation—according"
7000,THE TRAVELLER.,"to Tom Davies, the bookseller—was that he meant the rack. But Davies"
7001,THE TRAVELLER.,"may have misunderstood him, or Goldsmith himself may have forgotten the"
7002,THE TRAVELLER.,"facts. (See Forster’s _Life_, 1871, i. 370.) At pp. 57–78 of"
7003,THE TRAVELLER.,"the _ Monthly Review_ for July, 1757 (upon which Goldsmith was"
7004,THE TRAVELLER.,"at this date employed), is a summary, ‘from our correspondent at Paris,’"
7005,THE TRAVELLER.,"of the official record of the Damiens’ Trial, 4 vols. 12 mo.; and his deed"

7019,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"After having been for some time announced as in preparation, _The"
7020,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"Deserted Village_ made its first appearance on May 26, 1770.* It was"
7021,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"received with great enthusiasm. In June a second, third, and fourth"
7022,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"edition followed, and in August a fifth was published. The text here given"
7023,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"is that of the fourth edition, which was considerably revised. Johnson, we"
7024,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"are told, thought _The Deserted Village_ inferior to _The"
7025,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"Traveller_: but ‘time,’ to use Mr. Forster’s words, ‘has not"
7026,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,confirmed _that_ judgment.’ Its germ is perhaps to be found in ll.
7027,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,397–402 of the earlier poem.
7028,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,
7029,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,
7030,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"* In the American _Bookman_ for February, 1901, pp."
7031,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"563–7, Mr. Luther S. Livingston gives an account (with facsimile"
7032,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,title-pages) of three _octavo_ (or rather duodecimo) editions all
7033,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"dated 1770; and ostensibly printed for ‘W. Griffin, at Garrick’s Head, in"
7034,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"Catherine-street, Strand.’ He rightly describes their existence as ‘a"
7035,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,bibliographical puzzle.’ They afford no important variations; are not
7036,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,mentioned by the early editors; and are certainly not in the form in which
7037,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"the poem was first advertised and reviewed, as this was a quarto. But they"
7038,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,are naturally of interest to the collector; and the late Colonel Francis
7039,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"Grant, a good Goldsmith scholar, described one of them in the _Athenaeum_"
7040,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"for June 20, 1896 (No. 3582)."
7041,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,
7042,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,Much research has been expended in the endeavour to identify the scene
7043,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"with Lissoy, the home of the poet’s youth (see _Introduction_, p."
7044,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,ix); but the result has only been partially successful. The truth seems
7045,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"that Goldsmith, living in England, recalled in a poem that was English in"
7046,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,its conception many of the memories and accessories of his early life in
7047,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"Ireland, without intending or even caring to draw an exact picture. Hence,"
7048,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"as Lord Macaulay has observed, in a much criticized and characteristic"
7049,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"passage, ‘it is made up of incongruous parts. The village in its happy"
7050,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,days is a true English village. The village in its decay is an Irish
7051,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,village. The felicity and the misery which Goldsmith has brought close
7052,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"together belong to two different countries, and to two different stages in"
7053,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,the progress of society. He had assuredly never seen in his native island
7054,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"such a rural paradise, such a seat of plenty, content, and tranquillity,"
7055,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,as his “Auburn.” He had assuredly never seen in England all the
7056,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,inhabitants of such a paradise turned out of their homes in one day and
7057,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,forced to emigrate in a body to America. The hamlet he had probably seen
7058,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"in Kent; the ejectment he had probably seen in Munster; but, by joining"
7059,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"the two, he has produced something which never was and never will be seen"
7060,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"in any part of the world.’ (_Encyclop. Britannica_, 1856.) It"
7061,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,is obvious also that in some of his theories—the depopulation of the
7062,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"kingdom, for example—Goldsmith was mistaken. But it was not for its"
7063,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"didactic qualities then, nor is it for them now, that _The Deserted"
7064,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,Village_’ delighted and delights. It maintains its popularity by its
7065,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"charming _genre_-pictures, its sweet and tender passages, its"
7066,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"simplicity, its sympathetic hold upon the enduring in human nature. To"
7067,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"test it solely with a view to establish its topographical accuracy, or to"
7068,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"insist too much upon the value of its ethical teaching, is to mistake its"
7069,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,real mission as a work of art.
7070,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,
7071,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,Dedication. I am ignorant of that art in which you are
7072,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,said to excel. This modest confession did not prevent Goldsmith from
7073,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,making fun of the contemporary connoisseur. See the letter from the young
7074,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"virtuoso in _The Citizen of the World_, 1762, i. 145,"
7075,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,announcing that a famous ‘torse’ has been discovered to be not ‘a

7092,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"continuing the quotation on p. 169, was of the opinion that ‘the sudden"
7093,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,"affluence occasioned by trade, forced open all the sluices of luxury, and"
7094,THE DESERTED VILLAGE.,overflowed the land with every species of profligacy and corruption.’ (_Humphry

7143,HAWTHORN TREE,"(the grandfather of the gentleman who now [1807] lives in the house,"

7240,HAWTHORN TREE,

7244,HAWTHORN TREE,"years.’ (_Percy Memoir_, 1801, i. 49). But in another letter,"
7245,HAWTHORN TREE,"written towards the close of his life, it is still a thing to come. ‘I am"

7336,HAWTHORN TREE,"in front of Lissoy parsonage, of which there is a sketch in Newell’s _Poetical"
7337,HAWTHORN TREE,"Works_, 1811. When Newell wrote, it was already known as"
7338,HAWTHORN TREE,‘Goldsmith’s mount’; and the poet himself refers to it in a letter to his
7339,HAWTHORN TREE,"brother-in-law Hodson, dated Dec. 27, 1757:—‘I had rather be placed"
7340,HAWTHORN TREE,"on the little mount before Lishoy gate, and there take in, to me, the most"

7364,HAWTHORN TREE,Catherine Giraghty (or Geraghty). Her children (he said) were still living
7365,HAWTHORN TREE,in the neighbourhood of Lissoy in 1807. (Mangin’s _Essay on Light

7368,HAWTHORN TREE,The village preacher’s modest mansion rose. ‘The

7399,HAWTHORN TREE,upon the country at the conclusion of the ‘Seven Years’ War’ was a
7400,HAWTHORN TREE,"familiar figure at this period. Bewick, in his _Memoir_"
7401,HAWTHORN TREE,"(‘Memorial Edition’), 1887, pp. 44–5, describes some of these ancient"
7402,HAWTHORN TREE,campaigners with their battered old uniforms and their endless stories of
7403,HAWTHORN TREE,Minden and Quebec; and a picture of two of them by T. S. Good of Berwick
7404,HAWTHORN TREE,belonged to the late Mr. Locker Lampson. Edie Ochiltree (_Antiquary_)—it

7410,HAWTHORN TREE,"And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray."
7411,HAWTHORN TREE,Prior compares the opening lines of Dryden’s _Britannia Rediviva_:—
7412,HAWTHORN TREE,
7413,HAWTHORN TREE,
7414,HAWTHORN TREE,"Our vows are heard betimes, and heaven takes care"
7415,HAWTHORN TREE,

7417,HAWTHORN TREE,
7418,HAWTHORN TREE,"Preventing angels met it half the way,"

7420,HAWTHORN TREE,"And sent us back to praise, who came to pray."
7421,HAWTHORN TREE,
7422,HAWTHORN TREE,"As some tall cliff, etc. Lucan, Statius, and"
7423,HAWTHORN TREE,Claudian have been supposed to have helped Goldsmith to this fine and
7424,HAWTHORN TREE,"deservedly popular simile. But, considering his obvious familiarity with"
7425,HAWTHORN TREE,"French literature, and the rarity of his ‘obligations to the ancients,’ it"
7426,HAWTHORN TREE,"is not unlikely that, as suggested by a writer in the _Academy_"
7427,HAWTHORN TREE,"for Oct. 30, 1886, his source of suggestion is to be found in the"
7428,HAWTHORN TREE,following passage of an Ode addressed by Chapelain (1595–1674) to
7429,HAWTHORN TREE,Richelieu:—
7430,HAWTHORN TREE,
7431,HAWTHORN TREE,
7432,HAWTHORN TREE,Dans un paisible mouvement
7433,HAWTHORN TREE,
7434,HAWTHORN TREE,"Tu t’élèves au firmament,"

7444,HAWTHORN TREE,"Or another French model—indicated by Mr. Forster (_Life_,"
7445,HAWTHORN TREE,"1871, ii. 115–16) by the late Lord Lytton—may have been these lines"
7446,HAWTHORN TREE,from a poem by the Abbé de Chaulieu (1639–1720):—

7498,HAWTHORN TREE,"Full well they laugh’d, etc. Steele, in _Spectator_,"
7499,HAWTHORN TREE,"No. 49 (for April 26, 1711) has a somewhat similar thought:—‘_Eubulus_"

7546,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,"schoolmaster in his father’s village, who had been a quartermaster in the"

7548,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,having travelled over a considerable part of Europe and being of a very
7549,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,"romantic turn, he used to entertain Oliver with his adventures; and the"
7550,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,impressions these made on his scholar were believed by the family to have
7551,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,given him that wandering and unsettled turn which so much appeared in his
7552,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,"future life.’ (_Percy Memoir_, 1801, pp. 3–4.) The name of this"

7591,THE SCHOOL HOUSE,progresses according to the numbers he throws with the dice. At every

8261,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,"‘poet, in shabby finery,’ who asserts that he has composed them the day"
8262,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,"before. After some preliminary difficulties, arising from the fact that"
8263,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,the laws of the club do not permit any author to inflict his own works
8264,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,"upon the assembly without a money payment, he introduces them as"
8265,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,"follows:—‘Gentlemen, says he,"
8266,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,the present piece is not one of your common epic
8267,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,"poems, which come from the press like paper kites in summer; there are"

8270,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,and hear with the same enthusiasm with which I have written. The poem
8271,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,begins with the description of an author’s bedchamber: the picture was
8272,DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR’S BEDCHAMBER.,"sketched in my own apartment; for you must know, gentlemen, that I am"

8417,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,"xxviii, pp. 241–45. This is the text here followed. The poem is an obvious"
8418,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,imitation of what its author calls (_Letters from a Nobleman to his
8419,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,"Son_, 1764, ii. 140) that ‘French elegant easy manner of telling a"
8420,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,"story,’ which Prior had caught from La Fontaine. But the inherent"
8421,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,simplicity of Goldsmith’s style is
8422,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,curiously evidenced by the absence of those illustrations and ingenious
8423,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,allusions which are Prior’s chief characteristic. And although Goldsmith
8424,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,included _The Ladle_ and _Hans Carvel_ in his _Beauties
8425,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,"of English Poesy_, 1767, he refrained wisely from copying the"

8428,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,Jack Book-worm led a college life. The version of
8429,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,1765 reads ‘liv’d’ for ‘led’.

8438,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,
8439,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,Her presence banish’d all his peace. Here in the
8440,THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION.,"first version the paragraph closes, and a fresh one is commenced as"

8518,A NEW SIMILE.,second edition of 1766 it occupies pp. 246–8 and forms Essay xix. The
8519,A NEW SIMILE.,"text here followed is that of the second edition, which varies slightly"
8520,A NEW SIMILE.,from the first. In both cases the poem is followed by the enigmatical
8521,A NEW SIMILE.,"initials ‘*J. B.,’ which, however, as suggested by Gibbs, may simply stand"
8522,A NEW SIMILE.,for ‘Jack Bookworm’ of _The Double Transformation_. (See p.

8591,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"This ballad, usually known as _The Hermit_, was written in or"
8592,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"before 1765, and printed privately in that year ‘for the amusement of the"
8593,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"Countess of Northumberland,’ whose acquaintance Goldsmith had recently"
8594,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,made through Mr. Nugent. (See the prefatory note to _The Haunch of
8595,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,Venison_.) Its title was ‘_Edwin and Angelina. A Ballad_.
8596,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"By Mr. Goldsmith.’ It was first published in _The Vicar of Wakefield_,"
8597,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"1766, where it appears at pp. 70–7, vol. i. In July, 1767, Goldsmith was"
8598,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,accused [by Dr. Kenrick] in the _St. James’s Chronicle_ of
8599,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,having taken it from Percy’s _ Friar of Orders Gray_. Thereupon
8600,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"he addressed a letter to the paper, of which the following is the material"
8601,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,portion:—‘Another Correspondent of yours accuses me of having
8602,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"taken a Ballad, I published some Time ago, from one by the ingenious Mr."
8603,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,Percy. I do not think there is any great Resemblance between the two
8604,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"Pieces in Question. If there be any, his Ballad is taken from mine. I read"
8605,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"it to Mr. Percy some Years ago, and he (as we both considered these Things"
8606,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"as Trifles at best) told me, with his usual Good Humour, the next Time I"
8607,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"saw him, that he had taken my Plan to form the fragments of Shakespeare"
8608,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"into a Ballad of his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may so"
8609,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"call it, and I highly approved it. Such petty Anecdotes as these are"
8610,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"scarce worth printing, and were it not for the busy Disposition of some of"
8611,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"your Correspondents, the Publick should never have known that he owes me"
8612,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"the Hint of his Ballad, or that I am obliged to his Friendship and"
8613,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"Learning for Communications of a much more important Nature.—I am,"
8614,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"Sir, your’s etc. OLIVER GOLDSMITH.’ (_St."
8615,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"James’s Chronicle_, July 23–5, 1767.) No contradiction of this"
8616,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,statement appears to have been offered by Percy; but in re-editing his
8617,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"_Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_ in 1775, shortly after"
8618,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"Goldsmith’s death, he affixed this note to _The Friar of Orders Gray_:—‘As"
8619,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,the foregoing song has been thought to have suggested to our late
8620,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"excellent poet, Dr. Goldsmith, the plan of his beautiful ballad of _Edwin"
8621,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"and Emma_ [_Angelina_], first printed [published?] in his"
8622,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"_ Vicar of Wakefield_, it is but justice to his memory to"
8623,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"declare, that his poem was written first, and that if there is any"
8624,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"imitation in the case, they will be found both to be indebted to the"
8625,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"beautiful old ballad, _Gentle Herdsman, etc._, printed in the"
8626,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"second volume of this work, which the doctor had much admired in"
8627,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"manuscript, and has finely improved’ (vol. i. p. 250). The same story is"
8628,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"told, in slightly different terms, at pp. 74–5 of the _Memoir_"
8629,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,of Goldsmith drawn up under Percy’s superintendence for the _Miscellaneous
8630,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"Works_ of 1801, and a few stanzas of _Gentle Herdsman_,"
8631,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"which Goldsmith is supposed to have had specially in mind, are there"
8632,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,reproduced. References to them will be found in the ensuing notes. The
8633,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,text here adopted (with exception of ll. 117–20) is that of the fifth
8634,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"edition of _The Vicar of Wakefield_, 1773[4], i. pp. 78–85; but"
8635,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"the variations of the earlier version of 1765 are duly chronicled,"
8636,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,together with certain hitherto neglected differences between the first and
8637,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,later editions of the novel. The poem was also printed in the _Poems
8638,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"for Young Ladies_, 1767, pp. 91–8.* The author himself, it may be added,"
8639,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"thought highly of it. ‘As to my “Hermit,” that poem,’ he is reported to"
8640,EDWIN AND ANGELINA.,"have said, ‘cannot be amended.’ (Cradock’s _Memoirs_, 1828, iv."

9353,‘OMNES.,"could recognize the sincerity of men, who, like Wesley, travelled ‘nine"
9354,‘OMNES.,"hundred miles in a month, and preached twelve times a week’ for no"

9356,‘OMNES.,"especially in the extravagancies of its camp followers, nothing but cant"
9357,‘OMNES.,and duplicity. It was this which prompted on the stage Foote’s _Minor_
9358,‘OMNES.,"(1760) and Bickerstaffe’s _ Hypocrite_ (1768); in art the _Credulity,"
9359,‘OMNES.,"Superstition, and Fanaticism_ of Hogarth (1762); and in literature"

9365,‘OMNES.,satirised sectaries came from one of the originals of the _Retaliation_
9366,‘OMNES.,gallery. Scott highly praises the character of Ezekiel Daw in Cumberland’s
9367,‘OMNES.,"_ Henry_, 1795, adding, in his large impartial fashion, with"
9368,‘OMNES.,reference to the general practice of representing Methodists either as
9369,‘OMNES.,"idiots or hypocrites, ‘A very different feeling is due to many, perhaps to"
9370,‘OMNES.,"most, of this enthusiastic sect; nor is it rashly to be inferred, that he"
9371,‘OMNES.,"who makes religion the general object of his life, is for that sole reason"
9372,‘OMNES.,to be held either a fool or an impostor.’ (Scott’s _Miscellaneous

9500,RETALIATION.,"and Person, furnished Subjects of Witticism.—The Doctor was called"
9501,RETALIATION.,"on for’ Retaliation, ‘and at their next Meeting produced the following"
9502,RETALIATION.,"Poem, which I think adds one Leaf to his immortal Wreath._ This account"
9503,RETALIATION.,"seems to have sufficed for Evans, Percy, and the earlier editors. But in"
9504,RETALIATION.,"vol. i. p. 78 of his edition of Goldsmith’s _Works_, 1854, Mr."
9505,RETALIATION.,Peter Cunningham published for the first time a fuller version of the
9506,RETALIATION.,"circumstances, derived from a manuscript lent to him by Mr. George Daniel"
9507,RETALIATION.,of Islington; and (says Mr. Cunningham) ‘evidently designed as a preface
9508,RETALIATION.,to a collected edition of the poems which grew out of Goldsmith’s trying
9509,RETALIATION.,his epigrammatic powers with Garrick.’ It is signed ‘D. Garrick.’ ‘At a
9510,RETALIATION.,"meeting’—says the writer—‘of a company of gentlemen, who were"
9511,RETALIATION.,"well known to each other, and diverting themselves, among many other"
9512,RETALIATION.,"things, with the peculiar oddities of Dr. Goldsmith, who would never allow"
9513,RETALIATION.,"a superior in any art, from writing poetry down to dancing a horn-pipe,"
9514,RETALIATION.,the Dr. with great eagerness insisted upon trying his epigrammatic powers
9515,RETALIATION.,"with Mr. Garrick, and each of them was to write the other’s epitaph. Mr."
9516,RETALIATION.,"Garrick immediately said that his epitaph was finished, and spoke the"
9517,RETALIATION.,following distich extempore:—
9518,RETALIATION.,
9519,RETALIATION.,
9520,RETALIATION.,"Here lies NOLLY Goldsmith, for shortness call’d Noll,"
9521,RETALIATION.,
9522,RETALIATION.,"Who wrote like an angel, but talk’d like poor Poll."
9523,RETALIATION.,
9524,RETALIATION.,
9525,RETALIATION.,"Goldsmith, upon the company’s laughing very heartily, grew very"
9526,RETALIATION.,"thoughtful, and either would not, or could not, write anything at that"
9527,RETALIATION.,"time: however, he went to work, and some weeks after produced the"
9528,RETALIATION.,"following printed poem called _ Retaliation_, which has been"
9529,RETALIATION.,"much admired, and gone through several editions.’ This account, though"
9530,RETALIATION.,"obviously from Garrick’s point of view, is now accepted as canonical, and"
9531,RETALIATION.,"has superseded those of Davies, Cradock, Cumberland, and others, to which"
9532,RETALIATION.,some reference is made in the ensuing notes. A few days after the
9533,RETALIATION.,"publication of the first edition, which appeared on the 18th or 19th of"
9534,RETALIATION.,"April, a ‘new’ or second edition was issued, with four pages of"
9535,RETALIATION.,"‘Explanatory Notes, Observations, etc.’ At the end came the following"
9536,RETALIATION.,"announcement:—‘G. Kearsly, the Publisher, thinks it his duty to"
9537,RETALIATION.,"declare, that"
9538,RETALIATION.,"Dr. Goldsmith wrote the Poem as it is here printed, a few errors of the"
9539,RETALIATION.,"press excepted, which are taken notice of at the bottom of this page.’"
9540,RETALIATION.,From this version _ Retaliation_ is here reproduced. In the
9541,RETALIATION.,"third edition, probably in deference to some wounded susceptibilities, the"
9542,RETALIATION.,too comprehensive ‘most Distinguished Wits of the Metropolis’ was
9543,RETALIATION.,"qualified into ‘_some of the most_ Distinguished Wits,’ etc., but no"
9544,RETALIATION.,further material alteration was made in the text until the suspicious
9545,RETALIATION.,lines on Caleb Whitefoord were added to the fifth edition.
9546,RETALIATION.,
9547,RETALIATION.,"With the exception of Garrick’s couplet, and the fragment of Whitefoord"
9548,RETALIATION.,"referred to at p. 234, none of the original epitaphs upon which Goldsmith"
9549,RETALIATION.,was invited to ‘retaliate’ have survived. But the unexpected ability of
9550,RETALIATION.,the retort seems to have prompted a number of _ex post facto_
9551,RETALIATION.,"performances, some of which the writers would probably have been glad to"
9552,RETALIATION.,"pass off as their first essays. Garrick, for example, produced three short"
9553,RETALIATION.,"pieces, one of which (‘Here, Hermes! says Jove, who with nectar was"
9554,RETALIATION.,mellow’) hits off many of Goldsmith’s contradictions and foibles with
9555,RETALIATION.,"considerable skill (_v._ Davies’s _Garrick_, 2nd ed.,"
9556,RETALIATION.,"1780, ii. 157). Cumberland (_v. Gent. Mag._, Aug. 1778, p. 384)"
9557,RETALIATION.,"parodied the poorest part of _ Retaliation_, the comparison of"
9558,RETALIATION.,"the guests to dishes, by likening them to liquors, and Dean Barnard in"
9559,RETALIATION.,return rhymed upon Cumberland. He wrote also an apology for his first
9560,RETALIATION.,"attack, which is said to have been very severe, and conjured the poet to"
9561,RETALIATION.,"set his wit at Garrick, who, having fired his first shot, was keeping out"
9562,RETALIATION.,of the way:—
9563,RETALIATION.,
9564,RETALIATION.,
9565,RETALIATION.,On him let all thy vengeance fall;
9566,RETALIATION.,
9567,RETALIATION.,On me you but misplace it:
9568,RETALIATION.,
9569,RETALIATION.,Remember how he called thee _Poll_—
9570,RETALIATION.,
9571,RETALIATION.,"But, ah! he dares not face it."
9572,RETALIATION.,
9573,RETALIATION.,
9574,RETALIATION.,"For these, and other forgotten pieces arising out of _Retaliation_,"
9575,RETALIATION.,Garrick had apparently prepared the above-mentioned introduction. It may
9576,RETALIATION.,"be added that the statement, prefixed to the first edition, that"
9577,RETALIATION.,"_Retaliation_, as we now have it, was produced at the ‘next meeting’ of"
9578,RETALIATION.,"the Club, is manifestly incorrect. It was composed and circulated in"
9579,RETALIATION.,"detached fragments, and Goldsmith was still working at it when he was"
9580,RETALIATION.,seized with his last illness.

9586,RETALIATION.,published by Griffin in 1776.
9587,RETALIATION.,
9588,RETALIATION.,"Each guest brought his dish. ‘Chez Scarron,’—says"
9589,RETALIATION.,"his editor, M. Charles Baumet, when speaking of the poet’s entertainments,—‘venait"

9603,RETALIATION.,"an occasional club.’ This, it should be stated, was not the famous"
9604,RETALIATION.,"‘Literary Club,’ which met at the Turk’s Head Tavern in Gerrard Street."
9605,RETALIATION.,"The St. James’s Coffee-house, as familiar to Swift and Addison at the"
9606,RETALIATION.,"beginning, as it was to Goldsmith and his friends at the end of the"
9607,RETALIATION.,"eighteenth century, was the last house but one on the south-west corner"
9608,RETALIATION.,"of St. James’s Street. It now no longer exists. Cradock (_Memoirs_,"
9609,RETALIATION.,"1826, i. 228–30) speaks of dining _at the bottom of St. James’s Street_"
9610,RETALIATION.,"with Goldsmith, Percy, the two Burkes (_v. infra_), Johnson, Garrick,"

9650,RETALIATION.,Unfortunately in Cumberland’s septuagenarian recollections the ‘truth
9651,RETALIATION.,severe’ is mingled with an unusual amount of ‘fairy fiction.’ However Sir

9676,RETALIATION.,"i. 369–71, he gives an account of the origin of _ Retaliation_,"

9691,RETALIATION.,"Christian name, however, was _Joseph_ (Letter of Burke, November 8,"
9692,RETALIATION.,"1774). He was a jovial, good-natured, over-blunt Irishman, the legal"
9693,RETALIATION.,adviser of both Burke and Reynolds. Indeed it was Hickey who drew the
9694,RETALIATION.,conveyance of the land on which Reynolds’s house ‘next to the Star and
9695,RETALIATION.,Garter’ at Richmond (Wick House) was built by Chambers the architect.
9696,RETALIATION.,"Hickey died in 1794. Reynolds painted his portrait for Burke, and it was"
9697,RETALIATION.,exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1772 (No. 208). In 1833 it belonged to
9698,RETALIATION.,Mr. T. H. Burke. Sir Joshua also painted Miss Hickey in 1769–73. Her

9702,RETALIATION.,Magnanimous Goldsmith. According to Malone

9707,RETALIATION.,afterwards first Viscount Sydney. He died in 1800. Junius says Bolton
9708,RETALIATION.,"Corney, gives a portrait of him as _still life_. His presence in"
9709,RETALIATION.,_ Retaliation_ is accounted for by the fact that he had
9710,RETALIATION.,"commented in Parliament upon Johnson’s pension. ‘I am well assured,’ says"
9711,RETALIATION.,"Boswell, ‘that Mr. Townshend’s attack upon Johnson was the occasion of his"
9712,RETALIATION.,"“hitching in a rhyme”; for, that in the original copy of Goldsmith’s"
9713,RETALIATION.,"character of Mr. Burke, in his _ Retaliation_ another person’s"
9714,RETALIATION.,name stood in the couplet where Mr. Townshend is now introduced.’
9715,RETALIATION.,"(Birkbeck Hill’s _ Boswell_, 1887, iv. 318.)"
9716,RETALIATION.,
9717,RETALIATION.,too deep for his hearers. ‘The emotion to which he
9718,RETALIATION.,"commonly appealed was that too rare one, the love of wisdom, and he"
9719,RETALIATION.,combined his thoughts and knowledge in propositions of wisdom so weighty
9720,RETALIATION.,"and strong, that the minds of ordinary hearers"
9721,RETALIATION.,"were not on the instant prepared for them.’ (Morley’s _Burke_,"
9722,RETALIATION.,"1882, 209–10.)"
9723,RETALIATION.,
9724,RETALIATION.,"And thought of convincing, while they thought of"
9725,RETALIATION.,"dining. For the reason given in the previous note, many of Burke’s"
9726,RETALIATION.,"hearers often took the opportunity of his rising to speak, to retire to"
9727,RETALIATION.,dinner. Thus he acquired the nickname of the ‘Dinner Bell.’
9728,RETALIATION.,
9729,RETALIATION.,To eat mutton cold. There is a certain resemblance
9730,RETALIATION.,"between this character and Gray’s lines on himself written in 1761,"
9731,RETALIATION.,"beginning ‘Too poor for a bribe, and too proud to importune.’ (See Gosse’s"
9732,RETALIATION.,"_Gray’s Works_, 1884, i. 127.) But both Gray and Goldsmith may"
9733,RETALIATION.,have been thinking of a line in the once popular song of _Ally
9734,RETALIATION.,Croaker_:—
9735,RETALIATION.,
9736,RETALIATION.,
9737,RETALIATION.,"Too dull for a wit, too grave for a joker."
9738,RETALIATION.,
9739,RETALIATION.,"honest William, i.e. William Burke (_v. supra_)."
9740,RETALIATION.,
9741,RETALIATION.,"Now breaking a jest, and now breaking a limb. A"
9742,RETALIATION.,"note to the second edition says—‘The above Gentleman [Richard Burke,"
9743,RETALIATION.,"_v. supra_] having slightly fractured one of his arms and legs, at"
9744,RETALIATION.,"different times, the Doctor [i.e. Goldsmith] has rallied him on those"
9745,RETALIATION.,"accidents, as a kind of _retributive_ justice for breaking his jests"
9746,RETALIATION.,on other people.’
9747,RETALIATION.,
9748,RETALIATION.,Here Cumberland lies. According to Boaden’s _Life
9749,RETALIATION.,"of Kemble_, 1825, i. 438, Mrs. Piozzi rightly regarded this portrait"
9750,RETALIATION.,"as wholly ironical; and Bolton Corney, without much expenditure of acumen,"
9751,RETALIATION.,discovers it to have been written in a spirit of _persiflage_.
9752,RETALIATION.,"Nevertheless, Cumberland himself (_Memoirs_, 1807, i. 369)"
9753,RETALIATION.,seems to have accepted it in good faith. Speaking of Goldsmith he says—I
9754,RETALIATION.,conclude my account of him with gratitude for the epitaph he bestowed on
9755,RETALIATION.,me in his poem called _ Retaliation_.’ From the further details
9756,RETALIATION.,"which he gives of the circumstances, it would appear that his own"
9757,RETALIATION.,"performance, of which he could recall but one line—"
9758,RETALIATION.,
9759,RETALIATION.,
9760,RETALIATION.,"All mourn the poet, I lament the man—"
9761,RETALIATION.,
9762,RETALIATION.,"was conceived in a less malicious spirit than those of the others, and had"
9763,RETALIATION.,predisposed the sensitive bard in his favour. But no very genuine
9764,RETALIATION.,cordiality could be expected to exist between the rival authors of _The
9765,RETALIATION.,West Indian_ and _She Stoops to Conquer_.
9766,RETALIATION.,
9767,RETALIATION.,And Comedy wonders at being so fine. It is
9768,RETALIATION.,instructive
9769,RETALIATION.,here to transcribe Goldsmith’s serious opinion of the kind of work which
9770,RETALIATION.,Cumberland essayed:—‘A new species of Dramatic Composition has been
9771,RETALIATION.,"introduced, under the name of _ Sentimental_ Comedy, in which the"
9772,RETALIATION.,"virtues of Private Life are exhibited, rather than the Vices exposed; and"
9773,RETALIATION.,"the Distresses rather than the Faults of Mankind, make our interest in the"
9774,RETALIATION.,"piece. . . . In these Plays almost all the Characters are good, and"
9775,RETALIATION.,exceedingly generous; they are lavish enough of their _Tin_ Money on
9776,RETALIATION.,"the Stage, and though they want Humour, have abundance of Sentiment and"
9777,RETALIATION.,"Feeling. If they happen to have Faults or Foibles, the Spectator is taught"
9778,RETALIATION.,"not only to pardon, but to applaud them, in consideration of the goodness"
9779,RETALIATION.,"of their hearts; so that Folly, instead of being ridiculed, is commended,"
9780,RETALIATION.,and the Comedy aims at touching our Passions without the power of being
9781,RETALIATION.,"truly pathetic.’ (_Westminster Magazine_, 1772, i. 5.) Cf. also"
9782,RETALIATION.,"the _Preface to The Good Natur’d Man_, where he ‘hopes that too"
9783,RETALIATION.,"much refinement will not banish humour and character from our’s, as it has"
9784,RETALIATION.,already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now
9785,RETALIATION.,"become so very elevated and sentimental, that it has not only banished"
9786,RETALIATION.,"humour and _Moliere_ from the stage, but it has banished all"
9787,RETALIATION.,spectators too.’
9788,RETALIATION.,
9789,RETALIATION.,"The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks. Dr."
9790,RETALIATION.,John Douglas (_v. supra_) distinguished himself by his exposure of
9791,RETALIATION.,"two of his countrymen, Archibald Bower, 1686–1766, who, being secretly a"
9792,RETALIATION.,"member of the Catholic Church, wrote a _History of the Popes_;"
9793,RETALIATION.,"and William Lauder 1710–1771, who attempted to prove Milton a plagiarist."

9818,RETALIATION.,"fifth Earl of Chesterfield, to whom he had been tutor. His life previously"
9819,RETALIATION.,had long been scandalous enough to justify Goldsmith’s words. Johnson made

9836,RETALIATION.,"1738–96, who, in 1773, had followed up his Erse epics by a prose"

9860,RETALIATION.,"‘The lines on Garrick,’ says Forster, _Life of Goldsmith_,"

9870,RETALIATION.,"1770; _The School for Wives_, 1774, and other _sentimental"

9872,RETALIATION.,"Garrick’s prologue as a ‘Sermon,’ ‘preach’d in Acts,’ was produced at"
9873,RETALIATION.,Drury Lane just six days before Goldsmith’s comedy of _The Good
9874,RETALIATION.,"Natur’d Man_ appeared at Covent Garden, and obtained a success which"
9875,RETALIATION.,it ill deserved. _False Delicacy_—said Johnson truly
9876,RETALIATION.,"(Birkbeck Hill’s _ Boswell_, 1887, ii. 48)—‘was totally"
9877,RETALIATION.,"void of character,’—a crushing accusation to make against a drama."
9878,RETALIATION.,"But Garrick, for his private ends, had taken up Kelly as a rival to"
9879,RETALIATION.,Goldsmith; and the _comédie sérieuse_ or _ larmoyante_
9880,RETALIATION.,"of La Chaussée, Sedaine, and Diderot had already found votaries in"
9881,RETALIATION.,"England. _False Delicacy_, weak, washy, and invertebrate as it"
9882,RETALIATION.,"was, completed the transformation of ‘genteel’ into ‘sentimental’ comedy,"
9883,RETALIATION.,"and establishing that _genre_ for the next few years, effectually retarded"
9884,RETALIATION.,the wholesome reaction towards humour and character which Goldsmith had

9919,RETALIATION.,Here Reynolds is laid. This shares the palm with
9920,RETALIATION.,"the admirable epitaphs on Garrick and Burke. But Goldsmith loved Reynolds,"
9921,RETALIATION.,and there are no satiric strokes in the picture. If we are to believe
9922,RETALIATION.,"Malone (Reynolds’s _Works_, second edition, 1801, i. xc),"

9928,RETALIATION.,refers to his ‘equal and placid temper.’ Cf. also Dean Barnard’s verses

9934,RETALIATION.,"the Vatican in 1751, Reynolds caught so severe a cold ‘as to occasion a"
9935,RETALIATION.,deafness which obliged him to use an ear-trumpet for the remainder of his
9936,RETALIATION.,"life.’ (Taylor and Leslie’s _Reynolds_, 1865, i. 50.) This"
9937,RETALIATION.,instrument figures in a portrait of himself which he painted for Thrale
9938,RETALIATION.,about 1775. See also Zoffany’s picture of the ‘Academicians gathered about
9939,RETALIATION.,"the model in the Life School at Somerset House,’ 1772, where he is shown"

9943,RETALIATION.,"snuff-taker. His snuff-box, described in the Catalogue as the one"

9945,RETALIATION.,"with his spectacles and other personal relics, at the Grosvenor Gallery in"
9946,RETALIATION.,1883–4. In the early editions this epitaph breaks off abruptly at the word
9947,RETALIATION.,‘snuff.’ But Malone says that half a line more had been written. Prior
9948,RETALIATION.,"gives this half line as ‘By flattery unspoiled—,’ and affirms that"
9949,RETALIATION.,among several erasures in the manuscript sketch devoted to Reynolds it
9950,RETALIATION.,"‘remained unaltered.’ (_Life_, 1837, ii. 499.) See notes to ll."

9953,RETALIATION.,Here Whitefoord reclines. The circumstances which
9954,RETALIATION.,led to the insertion of these lines in the fifth edition are detailed in
9955,RETALIATION.,the prefatory words of the publisher given at p. 92. There is more than a
9956,RETALIATION.,suspicion that Whitefoord wrote them himself; but they have too long been
9957,RETALIATION.,accepted as an appendage to the poem to be now displaced. Caleb Whitefoord
9958,RETALIATION.,"(born 1734) was a Scotchman, a wine-merchant, and an art connoisseur, to"
9959,RETALIATION.,"whom J. T. Smith, in his _Life of Nollekens_, 1828, i. 333–41,"
9960,RETALIATION.,devotes several pages. He was one of the party at the St. James’s
9961,RETALIATION.,Coffee-house. He died in 1810. There is a caricature of him in
9962,RETALIATION.,"‘Connoisseurs inspecting a Collection of George Morland,’ November, 16,"
9963,RETALIATION.,"1807; and Wilkie’s _Letter of Introduction_, 1814, was a"
9964,RETALIATION.,"reminiscence of a visit which, when he first came to London, he paid to"
9965,RETALIATION.,Whitefoord. He was also painted by Reynolds and Stuart. Hewins’s _Whitefoord

10022,RETALIATION.,"(Northcote’s _Life of Reynolds_, 2nd ed., 1819, i. 217). What"
10023,RETALIATION.,"is perhaps more remarkable is, that Johnson spoke of Whitefoord’s"
10024,RETALIATION.,"performances as ‘ingenious and diverting’ (Birkbeck Hill’s _Boswell_,"
10025,RETALIATION.,"1887, iv. 322); and Horace Walpole laughed over them till he cried (Letter"
10026,RETALIATION.,"to Montagu, December 12, 1766). To use Voltaire’s witticism, he is _bien"
10027,RETALIATION.,"heureux_ who can laugh now. It may be added that Whitefoord did not, as"
10028,RETALIATION.,"he claimed, originate the ‘Cross Readings.’ They had been anticipated in"

10149,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"_Collection of Poems by Several Hands_, 4th ed., 1755. One of"
10150,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"the Epistles, beginning ‘Clarinda, dearly lov’d, attend The Counsels of a"
10151,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"faithful friend,’ seems to have betrayed Goldsmith into the blunder of"
10152,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"confusing it, in the _Poems for Young Ladies_. 1767, p. 114,"
10153,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,with Lyttelton’s better-known _ Advice to a Lady_ (‘The
10154,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,counsels of
10155,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"a friend, Belinda, hear’), also in Dodsley’s miscellany; while another"
10156,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"piece, an _Ode to William Pultney, Esq._, contains a stanza so"
10157,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,good that Gibbon worked it into his character of Brutus:—
10158,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,
10159,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,
10160,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"What tho’ the good, the brave, the wise,"
10161,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,

10171,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,
10172,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Detraction, however, has insinuated that Mallet, his step-son’s tutor, was"
10173,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,Nugent’s penholder in this instance. ‘Mr. Nugent sure did not write his
10174,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"own Ode,’ says Gray to Walpole (Gray’s _Works_, by Gosse, 1884,"
10175,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"ii. 220). Earl Nugent died in Dublin in October, 1788, and was buried at"
10176,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Gosfield in Essex, a property he had acquired with his second wife. A _"
10177,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,Memoir_ of him was written in 1898 by Mr. Claud Nugent. He is described
10178,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"by Cunningham as ‘a big, jovial, voluptuous Irishman, with a loud voice, a"
10179,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"strong Irish accent, and a ready though coarse wit.’ According to Percy (_Memoir_,"
10180,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"1801, p. 66), he had been attracted to Goldsmith by the publication of"
10181,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"_The Traveller_ in 1764, and he mentioned him favourably to the"
10182,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Earl of Northumberland, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A note in"
10183,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Forster’s _Life_, 1871, ii. 329–30, speaks of Goldsmith as a"
10184,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"frequent visitor at Gosfield, and at Nugent’s house in Great George"
10185,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Street, Westminster, where he had often for playmate his host’s daughter,"
10186,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Mary, afterwards Marchioness of Buckingham."
10187,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,
10188,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,Scott and others regarded _The Haunch of Venison_ as
10189,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"autobiographical. To what extent this is the case, it is difficult to say."
10190,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,That it represents the actual thanks of the poet to Lord Clare for an
10191,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"actual present of venison, part of which he promptly transferred to"
10192,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Reynolds, is probably the fact. But, as the following notes show, it is"
10193,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"also clear that Goldsmith borrowed, if not his entire fable, at least some"
10194,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"of its details from Boileau’s third satire; and that, in certain of the"
10195,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"lines, he had in memory Swift’s _Grand Question Debated_, the"
10196,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,measure of which he adopts. This throws more than a doubt upon the truth
10197,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,of the whole. ‘His genius’ (as Hazlitt says) ‘was a mixture of originality
10198,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,and imitation’; and fact and fiction often mingle inseparably
10199,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,in his work. The author of the bailiff scene in the _Good Natur’d Man_
10200,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,was quite capable of inventing for the nonce the tragedy of the unbaked
10201,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"pasty, or of selecting from the Pilkingtons and Purdons of his"
10202,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,acquaintance such appropriate guests for his Mile End Amphitryon as the
10203,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,writers of the _Snarler_ and the _Scourge_. It may
10204,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"indeed even be doubted whether, if _The Haunch of Venison_ had"
10205,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"been absolute personal history, Goldsmith would ever have retailed it to"
10206,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"his noble patron at Gosfield, although it may include enough of real"
10207,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,experience to serve as the basis for a _jeu d’esprit_.

10252,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Such dainties to them! It _would_ look like a flirt,"

10257,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Cunningham quotes a similar idea from T. Brown’s _Laconics, Works_,"
10258,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"1709, iv. 14. ‘To treat a poor wretch with a bottle of Burgundy, or fill"
10259,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"his snuff-box, is like giving a pair of lace ruffles to a man that has"
10260,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"never a shirt on his back.’ But Goldsmith, as was his wont, had already"
10261,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"himself employed the same figure. ‘Honours to one in my situation,’ he"
10262,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"says in a letter to his brother Maurice, in January, 1770, when speaking"
10263,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"of his appointment as Professor of Ancient History to the Royal Academy,"
10264,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,‘are something like ruffles to a man that wants a shirt’ (_Percy
10265,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Memoir_, 1801, 87–8). His source was probably, not Brown’s _Laconics_,"
10266,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,but those French ‘ana’ he knew so well. According to M. J. J. Jusserand (_English
10267,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Essays from a French Pen_, 1895, pp. 160–1), the originator of this"
10268,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"conceit was M. Samuel de Sorbieres, the traveller in England who was"
10269,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,assailed by Bishop Sprat. Considering himself inadequately rewarded by his
10270,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"patrons, Mazarin, Louis XIV, and Pope Clement IX, he said bitterly—‘They"
10271,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,give lace cuffs to a man without a shirt’; a ‘consolatory witticism’ which
10272,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"he afterwards remodelled into, ‘I wish they would send me bread for the"
10273,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,butter they kindly provided me with.’ In this form it appears in the
10274,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,"Preface to the _Sorberiana_, Toulouse, 1691."
10275,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,
10276,THE HAUNCH OF VENISON.,_a flirt_ is a jibe or jeer. ‘He would sometimes . . . cast out a

10778,‘SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.’,"Housemaid; or, Piety in Pattens_, which did as much as _ She"
10779,‘SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.’,Stoops_ to laugh false sentiment away. Foote warned his audience
10780,‘SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.’,"that they would not discover ‘much wit or humour’ in the piece, since ‘his"
10781,‘SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.’,"brother writers had all agreed that it was highly improper, and beneath"

10785,‘SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.’,"explained, he had, like them, given up the sensual for the sentimental"

11089,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,Forster thus describes the MS. of this poem in his _Life of Goldsmith_:—‘It
11090,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"is a small quarto manuscript of thirty-four pages, containing 679 lines,"
11091,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,to which a fly-leaf is appended in which Goldsmith notes the differences
11092,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,of nomenclature between Vida’s chessmen and our own. It has occasional
11093,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"interlineations and corrections, but such as would occur in transcription"
11094,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,rather than in a first or original copy. Sometimes indeed choice appears
11095,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,to have been made (as at page 29) between two words equally suitable to
11096,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"the sense and verse, as “to” for “toward”; but the insertions and erasures"
11097,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,refer almost wholly to words or lines accidentally omitted and replaced.
11098,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,The triplet is always carefully marked; and seldom as it is found in any
11099,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,other of Goldsmith’s poems. I am disposed to regard its frequent
11100,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"recurrence here as even helping, in some degree, to explain the motive"
11101,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,which had led him to the trial of an experiment in rhyme comparatively new
11102,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"to him. If we suppose him, half consciously, it may be, taking up the"
11103,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"manner of the great master of translation, Dryden, who was at all times so"
11104,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"much a favourite with him, he would at least, in so marked a peculiarity,"
11105,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,be less apt to fall short than to err perhaps a little on the side of
11106,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,excess. Though I am far from thinking such to be the result in the present
11107,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"instance. The effect of the whole translation is pleasing to me, and the"
11108,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,mock-heroic effect I think not a little assisted by the reiterated use of
11109,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,the triplet and alexandrine. As to any evidence of authorship derivable
11110,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"from the appearance of the manuscript, I will only add another word. The"
11111,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"lines in the translation have been carefully counted, and the number is"
11112,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,marked in Goldsmith’s hand at the close of his transcription. Such a fact
11113,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"is, of course, only to be taken in aid of other proof; but a man is not"
11114,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"generally at the pains of counting, still less, I should say in such a"
11115,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"case as Goldsmith’s, of elaborately transcribing, lines which are not his"
11116,VIDA’S GAME OF CHESS.,"own.’ (Forster’s _Goldsmith_, 1871, ii. 235–6)."

11155,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,PORTRAITS of Goldsmith are not numerous; and the best known
11156,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,are those of Reynolds and H. W. Bunbury. That by Sir Joshua was painted in
11157,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"1766–70, and exhibited in the Royal Academy (No. 151) from April 24th to"
11158,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,May 28th in the latter year. It represents the poet in a plain white
11159,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"collar, furred mantle open at the neck, and holding a book in his right"
11160,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,hand. Its general characteristics are given at p. xxviii of the
11161,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,‘Introduction.’ It was scraped in mezzotint in 1770 by Reynolds’s Italian
11162,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"pupil, Giuseppe, or Joseph Marchi; and it is dated 1st December.*"
11163,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Bunbury’s portrait first appeared, after Goldsmith’s death, as a"
11164,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,frontispiece to the _Haunch of Venison_; and it was etched in
11165,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"facsimile by James Bretherton. The plate is dated May 24, 1776. In his"
11166,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"loyal but despotic _Life of Goldsmith_ (Bk. iv, ch. 6), Mr."
11167,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"John Forster reproduces these portraits side by side; in order, he"
11168,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"professes, to show ‘the distinction between truth and a caricature of it.’"
11169,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Bunbury, it may be, was primarily a caricaturist, and possibly looked at"
11170,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,most things from a more or less grotesque point of view; but this sketch—it
11171,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"should be observed—was meant for a likeness, and we have the express"
11172,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"testimony of one who, if she was Bunbury’s sister-in-law, was also"
11173,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Goldsmith’s friend, that it rendered Goldsmith accurately. It ‘gives the"
11174,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,head with admirable fidelity’—says the ‘Jessamy Bride’ (afterwards
11175,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,Mrs. Gwyn)—‘as he actually lived among us; nothing can exceed its
11176,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"truth’ (Prior’s _Life_, 1837, ii. 380). In other words, it"
11177,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"delineates Goldsmith as his contemporaries saw him, with bulbous"
11178,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"forehead, indecisive chin, and long protruding upper lip,—awkward,"
11179,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"insignificant, ill at ease,—restlessly burning ‘to get in and"
11180,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,shine.’ It enables us moreover to understand how people who knew nothing
11181,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"of his better and more lovable qualities, could speak of him as an"
11182,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"‘inspired idiot,’ as ‘silly Dr. Goldsmith,’ as ‘talking like poor Poll.’"
11183,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"It is, in short, his external, objective presentment. The picture by Sir"
11184,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Joshua, on the contrary, is almost wholly subjective. Draped judiciously"
11185,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"in a popular studio costume, which is not that of the sitter’s day, it"
11186,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,reveals to us the author of _The Deserted Village_ as Reynolds
11187,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"conceived him to be at his best, serious, dignified, introspective, with"
11188,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"his physical defects partly extenuated by art, partly over-mastered by his"
11189,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,intellectual power. To quote the ‘Jessamy Bride’ once more—it is ‘a
11190,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"fine poetical head for the admiration of posterity, but as it is divested"
11191,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"of his wig and with the shirt collar open, it was not the man as seen in"
11192,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,daily life’ (_Ib_. ii. 380). Had Goldsmith lived in our era of
11193,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"photography, photography would doubtless have given us something which"
11194,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"would have been neither the one nor the other, but more like Bunbury than"
11195,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,Reynolds. Yet we may be grateful for both. For Bunbury’s sketch and
11196,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,Reynolds’s portrait are alike indispensable to the true comprehension of
11197,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,Goldsmith’s curiously dual personality.**
11198,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,
11199,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,
11200,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,* This was the print to which Goldsmith referred in a well-known
11201,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"anecdote. Speaking to his old Peckham pupil, Samuel Bishop, whom, after"
11202,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"many years, he met accidentally in London, he asked him eagerly whether he"
11203,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"had got an engraving of the new portrait, and finding he had not, ‘said"
11204,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"with some emotion, “if your picture had been published, I should not have"
11205,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,suffered an hour to elapse without procuring it.”’ But he was speedily
11206,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"‘appeased by apologies.’ (Prior’s _Life_, 1837, i. 219–20.)"
11207,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,
11208,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,** There is in existence another undated etching by Bretherton after
11209,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Bunbury on a larger scale, which comes much nearer to Reynolds; and it is"
11210,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"of course possible, though not in our opinion probable, that Mrs. Gwyn may"
11211,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,have referred to this. But Forster selected the other for his comparison;
11212,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,it is prefixed to the _Haunch of Venison_; it is certainly the
11213,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,better known; and (as we believe) cannot ever have been intended for a
11214,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,caricature.
11215,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,
11216,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"The portrait by Reynolds, above referred to, was painted for the Thrale Gallery"
11217,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"at Streatham, on the dispersion of which, in May, 1816, it was bought for the"
11218,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,Duke of Bedford for £133 7s. It is now at Woburn Abbey (Cat. No. 254). At
11219,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Knole, Lord Sackville possesses another version (Cat. No. 239), which was"
11220,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"purchased in 1773 by the Countess Delawarr, and was shown at South Kensington"
11221,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,in 1867. Here the dress is a black coat and a brown mantle with fur. The
11222,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"present owner exhibited it at the Guelph Exhibition of 1891. A third version,"
11223,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"now in the Irish National Gallery, once belonged to Goldsmith himself, and then"
11224,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"to his brother-in-law, Daniel Hodson. Finally there is a copy, by a pupil of"
11225,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Reynolds, in the National Portrait Gallery, to which it was bequeathed in 1890"
11226,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"by Dr. Leifchild, having formerly been the property of Caleb Whitefoord. Caleb"
11227,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Whitefoord also had an ‘admirable miniature’ by Reynolds, which"
11228,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"belongs to the Rev. Benjamin Whitefoord, Hon. Canon of Salisbury (_Whitefoord"
11229,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Papers_, 1898, p. xxvii). A small circular print, based upon Reynolds, and"
11230,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"etched by James Basire, figures on the title-page of _Retaliation_. Some"
11231,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"of the plates are dated April 18, 1774.* The National Portrait Gallery has also"
11232,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"a silhouette, attributed to Ozias Humphry, R.A., which was presented in 1883 by"
11233,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Sir Theodore Martin, K.C.B. Then there is the portrait by Hogarth shown at"
11234,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,South Kensington in 1867 by the late Mr. Studley Martin of Liverpool. It
11235,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"depicts the poet writing at a round table in a black cap, claret-coloured coat"
11236,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,and ruffles. Of this there is a wood-cut in the later editions of
11237,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Forster’s _ Life_ (Bk. iii, ch. 14). The same exhibition of 1867"
11238,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"contained a portrait of Goldsmith in a brown coat and red waistcoat, ‘as"
11239,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"a young man.’ It was said to be extremely like him in face, and was"
11240,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,attributed to Gainsborough. In Evans’s edition of the _Poetical and
11241,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"Dramatic Works_ is another portrait engraved by Cook, said, on some copies,"
11242,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,to be ‘from an original drawing’; and there is in the Print Room at
11243,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"the British Museum yet another portrait still, engraved by William Ridley"
11244,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"‘from a painting in the possession of the Rev. Mr. Williams,’ no"
11245,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"doubt Goldsmith’s friend, the Rev. David Williams, founder of the Royal"
11246,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,Literary Fund. One of these last may have been the work to which the poet
11247,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"refers in a letter to his brother Maurice in January, 1770. ‘I have sent"
11248,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,my cousin Jenny [Jane Contarine] a miniature picture of myself . . . The face
11249,PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.,"you well know, is ugly enough, but it is finely painted’ (_Misc."

11380,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,taken by the reader with the needful grain of salt. Goldsmith probably
11381,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"remembered the hawthorn bush, the church upon the hill, the watercress"
11382,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"gatherer, and some other familiar objects of the ‘seats of his youth.’ But"
11383,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,distance added charm to the regretful retrospect; and in the details his
11384,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"fancy played freely with his memories. It would be unwise, for example, to"
11385,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,infer—as Mr. Hogan did—the decorations of the _Three
11386,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,Pidgeons_ at Lissoy from the account of the inn in the poem.* Some
11387,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"twelve years before its publication, when he was living miserably in Green"
11388,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"Arbour Court, Goldsmith had submitted to his brother Henry a sample of a"
11389,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,heroi-comic poem describing a Grub Street writer in bed in ‘a paltry
11390,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"ale-house.’ In this ‘the sanded floor,’ the ‘twelve good rules’ and the"
11391,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"broken tea-cups all played their parts as accessories, and even the"
11392,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"double-dealing chest had its prototype in the poet’s night-cap, which was"
11393,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,‘a cap by night—a stocking all the day.’ A year or two later he
11394,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"expanded these lines in the _Citizen of the World_, and the"
11395,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,scene becomes the Red Lion in Drury Lane. From this second version he
11396,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"adapted, or extended again, the description of the inn parlour in _The"
11397,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"Deserted Village_. It follows therefore, either that he borrowed for"
11398,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"London the details of a house in Ireland, or that he used for Ireland the"
11399,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"details of a house in London. If, on the other hand, it be contended that"
11400,THE SCHOOL-HOUSE.,"those details were common to both places, then the identification in these"

11424,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,are ‘not’ to be found in the Doctor’s collection. According to Mr. Sidney
11425,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,Lee’s admirable article in the _Dictionary of National Biography_
11426,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"on Sterne, that author is to be regarded as the ‘only begetter’ of the"

11428,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,the future author of _Tristram Shandy_ to the Miss Lumley he
11429,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,afterwards married. Here is the precise and characteristic passage:—‘I
11430,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"gave a thousand pensive, penetrating looks at the chair thou hadst so"
11431,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"often graced, in those quiet and _sentimental_ repasts—then"
11432,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"laid down my knife and fork, and took out my handkerchief, and clapped it"
11433,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"across my face, and wept like a child’ (Sterne’s _Works_ by"
11434,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"Saintsbury, 1894, v. 25). Nine years later, however circulated,"
11435,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,‘sentimental’ has grown ‘so much in vogue’ that it has reached from London
11436,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,to the provinces. ‘Mrs. Belfour’ (Lady Bradshaigh) writing from
11437,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"Lincolnshire to Richardson says:—‘Pray, Sir, give me leave to ask"
11438,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"you . . . what, in your opinion, is the meaning of the word _sentimental_,"
11439,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"so much in vogue amongst the polite, both in town and country? In letters"
11440,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"and common conversation, I have asked several who make use of it, and have"
11441,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"generally received for answer, it is—it is—_sentimental_."
11442,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,Every thing clever and agreeable is comprehended in that word; but [I] am
11443,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"convinced a wrong interpretation is given, because it is impossible every"
11444,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,thing clever and agreeable can be so common as this word. I am frequently
11445,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,astonished to hear such a one is a _sentimental_ man; we were a _sentimental_
11446,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,party; I have been taking a _ sentimental_ walk. And that I might be
11447,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"reckoned a little in the fashion, and, as I thought, show them the proper"
11448,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"use of the word, about six weeks ago, I declared I had just received a _"
11449,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"sentimental_ letter. Having often laughed at the word, and found fault"
11450,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"with the application of it, and this being the first time I ventured to"
11451,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"make use of it, I was loudly congratulated upon the occasion: but I should"
11452,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"be glad to know your interpretation of it’ (Richardson’s _Correspondence_,"
11453,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"1804, iv. pp. 282–3). The reply of the author of _Clarissa_,"
11454,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"which would have been interesting, is not given; but it is clear that by"
11455,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,this date (1749) ‘sentimental’ must already have been rather overworked by
11456,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,‘the polite.’ Eleven years after this we meet with it in the Prologue to

11476,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"fashionable one!’ (_Journal_, February 11, 1772). In 1773,"
11477,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,Goldsmith puts it in the ‘Dedication’ to _She Stoops_:—‘The
11478,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"undertaking a comedy, not merely _sentimental_, was very dangerous;’ and"
11479,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,Garrick (forgetting Kelly and _False Delicacy_) uses it more
11480,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"than once in his ‘Prologue’ to the same play, e.g.—‘Faces are blocks"
11481,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"in _sentimental_ scenes.’ Further examples might easily be multiplied, for"
11482,THE EPITHET ‘SENTIMENTAL.’,"the word, in spite of Johnson, had now come to stay. Two years"

11596,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,the following short account of the state of poetry in the first quarter of
11597,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,the Eighteenth Century.
11598,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,
11599,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"‘But, of all the other arts, poetry in this age was carried to the"
11600,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"greatest perfection. The language, for some ages, had been improving, but"
11601,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,now it seemed entirely divested of its roughness and barbarity. Among the
11602,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"poets of this period we may place John Philips, author of several poems,"
11603,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"but of none more admired than that humourous one, entitled, _The"
11604,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"Splendid Shilling_; he lived in obscurity, and died just above want."
11605,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"William Congreve deserves also particular notice; his comedies, some of"
11606,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"which were but coolly received upon their first appearance, seemed to mend"
11607,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"upon repetition; and he is, at present, justly allowed the foremost in"
11608,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,that species of dramatic poesy. His wit is ever just and brilliant; his
11609,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,sentiments new and lively; and his elegance equal to his regularity. Next
11610,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"him Vanbrugh is placed, whose humour seems more natural, and characters"
11611,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"more new; but he owes too many obligations to the French, entirely to pass"
11612,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"for an original; and his total disregard to decency, in a great measure,"
11613,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"impairs his merit. Farquhar is still more lively, and, perhaps more"
11614,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,entertaining than either; his pieces still continue the favourite
11615,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"performances of the stage, and bear frequent repetition without satiety;"
11616,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"but he often mistakes pertness for wit, and seldom strikes his characters"
11617,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"with proper force or originality. However, he died very young; and it is"
11618,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"remarkable, that he"
11619,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"continued to improve as he grew older; his last play, entitled _The"
11620,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"Beaux’ Strategem_, being the best of his productions. Addison, both"
11621,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"as a poet and prose writer, deserves the highest regard and imitation. His"
11622,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"_Campaign_, and _Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy_,"
11623,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"are masterpieces in the former, and his _Essays_ published in"
11624,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,the _ Spectator_ are inimitable specimens of the latter.
11625,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,Whatever he treated of was handled with elegance and precision; and that
11626,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"virtue which was taught in his writings, was enforced by his example."
11627,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,Steele was Addison’s friend and admirer; his comedies are perfectly
11628,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"polite, chaste, and genteel; nor were his other works contemptible; he"
11629,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"wrote on several subjects, and yet it is amazing, in the multiplicity of"
11630,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"his pursuits, how he found leisure for the discussion of any. Ever"
11631,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"persecuted by creditors, whom his profuseness drew upon him, or pursuing"
11632,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"impracticable schemes, suggested by ill-grounded ambition. Dean Swift was"
11633,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,the professed antagonist both of Addison and him. He perceived that there
11634,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,was a spirit of romance mixed with all the works of the poets who preceded
11635,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"him; or, in other words, that they had drawn nature on the most pleasing"
11636,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"side. There still therefore was a place left for him, who, careless of"
11637,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"censure, should describe it just as it was, with all its deformities; he"
11638,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"therefore owes much of his fame, not so much to the greatness of his"
11639,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"genius, as to the boldness of it. He was dry, sarcastic, and severe; and"
11640,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"suited his style exactly to the turn of his thought, being concise and"
11641,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,nervous. In this period also flourished many of subordinate fame. Prior
11642,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,was the first who adopted the French elegant easy manner of telling a
11643,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"story; but if what he has borrowed from that nation be taken from him,"
11644,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,scarce anything will be left upon which he can lay any claim to applause
11645,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,in poetry. Rowe was only outdone by Shakespeare and Otway as a tragic
11646,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"writer; he has fewer absurdities than either; and is, perhaps, as pathetic"
11647,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"as they; but his flights are not so bold, nor his characters so strongly"
11648,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,marked. Perhaps his coming later than the rest may have contributed to
11649,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"lessen the esteem he deserves. Garth had success as a poet; and, for a"
11650,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"time, his fame was even greater than his desert. In his principal work,"
11651,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"_The Dispensary_, his versification is negligent; and his plot"
11652,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"is now become tedious; but whatever he may lose as a poet, it would be"
11653,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,improper to rob him of the merit he deserves for having written the prose
11654,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"dedication, and preface, to the poem already mentioned; in which he"
11655,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"has shown the truest wit, with the most refined elegance. Parnell, though"
11656,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"he has written but one poem, namely, _The Hermit_, yet has"
11657,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"found a place among the English first rate poets. Gay, likewise, by his"
11658,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"_Fables_ and _Pastorals_, has acquired an equal"
11659,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"reputation. But of all who have added to the stock of English Poetry,"
11660,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"Pope, perhaps, deserves the first place. On him, foreigners look as one of"
11661,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,the most successful writers of his time; his versification is the most
11662,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,"harmonious, and his correctness the most remarkable of all our poets. A"
11663,GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND  GEORGE THE FIRST.,noted contemporary of his own calls the English the finest writers on
