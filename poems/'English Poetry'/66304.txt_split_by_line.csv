62,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,
63,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,In these translations from the Danish I have adhered strictly to the
64,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"metres of the original; this, however, is not the case with those from"
65,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,the Old Norse. The original ballads are not versifications of Northern
66,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"legends, but, like those in my previous volume, so far as matter goes,"
67,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,pure inventions of my own.
68,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,
69,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"The “Drowning of John Remorsson” is, according to Professor Gründtvig,"
70,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"in treatment, though not in subject, a Danish parallel to the Scottish"
71,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"“Sir Patrick Spens.” “Agnes and the Merman” seems to me interesting, as"
72,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,having possibly suggested to Matthew Arnold his “Forsaken Merman.”
73,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,
74,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"With regard to “The Awakening of Angantheow” and “The Lay of Thrym,” I"
75,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,have little but apologies to offer. No one can be more sensible than
76,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"myself of their short-comings. My excuse is, that I could learn of no"
77,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,other English metrical versions--and we all know _who_ rush in where
78,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,angels fear to tread! If my inadequacies exasperate some better poet
79,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,than myself to the production of versions nearer to the magnificent
80,AUTHOR’S PREFACE,"originals, they will at least have justified their existence."

142,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,"_NOTE.--Swafurlami, a king of the seed of Odin, stole the sword Tyrfing"
143,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,(ripper) from the dwarfs who forged it. They laid on it a curse--that it
144,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,should bring death to its bearer; that no wound made by it should be
145,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,healed; and that three deeds of woe should be wrought by it. Swafurlami
146,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,"is slain by Arngrim, who inherits the sword. Eyfura, his wife, has"
147,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,"twelve sons, all of whom become Vikings. Angantheow, the eldest, and his"
148,THE WAKING OF ANGANTHEOW,"brothers, are eventually all slain near Upsala by Hjalmar, and his"

354,THE LAY OF THRYM,
355,THE LAY OF THRYM,"When Thor awoke, his wrath was grim"
356,THE LAY OF THRYM,To find his hammer gone from him.
357,THE LAY OF THRYM,"He shook his beard, he tossed his hair,"
358,THE LAY OF THRYM,The Son of Earth sought here and there.
359,THE LAY OF THRYM,
360,THE LAY OF THRYM,And first of all he spake this word:
361,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Listen, Loki! never was heard"
362,THE LAY OF THRYM,In earth or heaven what now I say--
363,THE LAY OF THRYM,The Thunderer’s hammer is stolen away!”
364,THE LAY OF THRYM,
365,THE LAY OF THRYM,"To Freyja the fair their way they take,"
366,THE LAY OF THRYM,And this is the word that first he spake:
367,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Lend me thy feather-fell, I pray,"
368,THE LAY OF THRYM,"To seek my hammer, that’s stolen away.”"
369,THE LAY OF THRYM,
370,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Were it of silver, or were it of gold,"
371,THE LAY OF THRYM,"That would I give thee, that should’st thou hold.”"
372,THE LAY OF THRYM,
373,THE LAY OF THRYM,Loki he flew in the rustling fell
374,THE LAY OF THRYM,Out of the halls where the Aesir dwell
375,THE LAY OF THRYM,"To Jôtunheim. On a howe sat Thrym,"
376,THE LAY OF THRYM,"King o’ the giants, a-twisting trim"
377,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Golden bands for his hounds of speed,"
378,THE LAY OF THRYM,And smoothing the mane of his trusty steed;
379,THE LAY OF THRYM,And this is the word that first he said:
380,THE LAY OF THRYM,“What of the Aesir? What of the Elves?
381,THE LAY OF THRYM,Why art thou come to the Giant’s door?”
382,THE LAY OF THRYM,
383,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“’Tis ill with the Aesir, ill with the Elves!"
384,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Say, hast thou hidden the hammer of Thor?”"
385,THE LAY OF THRYM,
386,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Yea, I have hidden the hammer of thunder"
387,THE LAY OF THRYM,Eight full fathoms the earth down under;
388,THE LAY OF THRYM,No man shall win it in all his life
389,THE LAY OF THRYM,Until he shall bring me Freyja to wife.”
390,THE LAY OF THRYM,
391,THE LAY OF THRYM,Loki he flew in the rustling fell
392,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Out of the halls where the Giants dwell,"
393,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Until he came to Asgard’s bound,"
394,THE LAY OF THRYM,And Thor in the midmost garth he found.
395,THE LAY OF THRYM,And this is the word that first he said:
396,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“What tidings, toiling, hast thou won?"
397,THE LAY OF THRYM,"For a man that sits tells a stumbling tale,"
398,THE LAY OF THRYM,"And a man that lies, a lying one.”"
399,THE LAY OF THRYM,
400,THE LAY OF THRYM,“News for my toiling do I bring;
401,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Thrym has thine hammer, the Giant’s king,"
402,THE LAY OF THRYM,No man may win it in all his life
403,THE LAY OF THRYM,Until he take him Freyja to wife.”
404,THE LAY OF THRYM,
405,THE LAY OF THRYM,"To Freyja the fair their way they take,"
406,THE LAY OF THRYM,And this is the word that first he spake:
407,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Bind on thy bridal-veil amain,"
408,THE LAY OF THRYM,"For to Jôtunheim we must fare, we twain.”"
409,THE LAY OF THRYM,
410,THE LAY OF THRYM,Wroth was Freyja! she caught her breath--
411,THE LAY OF THRYM,"The hall of the Aesir shook beneath,"
412,THE LAY OF THRYM,The Brising necklace snapped in three.
413,THE LAY OF THRYM,“Marriage-mad is the name for me
414,THE LAY OF THRYM,If to Jôtunheim I fare with thee!”
415,THE LAY OF THRYM,
416,THE LAY OF THRYM,"All the Aesir to council went,"
417,THE LAY OF THRYM,"The mighty ones to parliament,"
418,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Gods and goddesses, all in wonder"
419,THE LAY OF THRYM,How to win back the hammer of thunder.
420,THE LAY OF THRYM,
421,THE LAY OF THRYM,"It was Heimdall spake amain,"
422,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Whitest of gods, the wily Wane:"
423,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Now bind on Thor the veil so fair,"
424,THE LAY OF THRYM,The Brising necklace let him wear;
425,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Hang round him many a clinking key,"
426,THE LAY OF THRYM,Let woman’s weeds fall to his knee;
427,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Jewels broad on his breast shall shine,"
428,THE LAY OF THRYM,And neatly shall ye the topknot twine!”
429,THE LAY OF THRYM,
430,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Up spake he, mightiest at need:"
431,THE LAY OF THRYM,“Call me a coward’s name indeed
432,THE LAY OF THRYM,If ever I wear a woman’s weed!”
433,THE LAY OF THRYM,
434,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Up spake Loki, Laufey’s son:"
435,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Thor, with thy witless words have done!"
436,THE LAY OF THRYM,Soon shall the Giants in Asgard reign
437,THE LAY OF THRYM,Unless thou win thine hammer again.”
438,THE LAY OF THRYM,
439,THE LAY OF THRYM,"On Thor they bound the veil so fair,"
440,THE LAY OF THRYM,The Brising necklace did he wear;
441,THE LAY OF THRYM,"They hung him with many a clinking key,"
442,THE LAY OF THRYM,Let women’s weeds fall to his knee;
443,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Jewels broad on his breast did shine,"
444,THE LAY OF THRYM,And neatly did they the topknot twine.
445,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Then Loki, son of Laufey, said:"
446,THE LAY OF THRYM,“I will go with thee as waiting-maid!”
447,THE LAY OF THRYM,
448,THE LAY OF THRYM,The goats they harness by two and by one--
449,THE LAY OF THRYM,"To the shafts they are shackled, well can they run!"
450,THE LAY OF THRYM,Valley and hill burst into flame
451,THE LAY OF THRYM,When Odin’s son to the Giants came.
452,THE LAY OF THRYM,
453,THE LAY OF THRYM,The King o’ the Giants did loudly call:
454,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Up now, Giants! strew the benches all!"
455,THE LAY OF THRYM,"See where the bride they bring adown,"
456,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Daughter of Niord, from Noa-town!"
457,THE LAY OF THRYM,
458,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Kine go here with gilded horn,"
459,THE LAY OF THRYM,Oxen black my garth adorn;
460,THE LAY OF THRYM,Gold have I and goods galore--
461,THE LAY OF THRYM,For Freyja alone I long so sore.”
462,THE LAY OF THRYM,
463,THE LAY OF THRYM,Evening fell on the blithe bridàle;
464,THE LAY OF THRYM,The Giants sat a-drinking ale.
465,THE LAY OF THRYM,"The greedy spouse of Sif, he ate"
466,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Seven salmon, every cate"
467,THE LAY OF THRYM,"For the ladies spread, and a goodly steer--"
468,THE LAY OF THRYM,"And he drank three tuns, his heart to cheer."
469,THE LAY OF THRYM,
470,THE LAY OF THRYM,"The King o’ the Giants, he up and cried:"
471,THE LAY OF THRYM,“Never was known such a hungry bride!
472,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Ne’er saw I lady so full of greed,"
473,THE LAY OF THRYM,Nor maiden drink so deep of mead!”
474,THE LAY OF THRYM,
475,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Sitting apart, the wily maid"
476,THE LAY OF THRYM,Answered what the Giant said:
477,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“This se’nnight past no meat had she,"
478,THE LAY OF THRYM,So fain she was to come to thee!”
479,THE LAY OF THRYM,
480,THE LAY OF THRYM,"He lifted the veil to kiss the bride,"
481,THE LAY OF THRYM,And the hall’s full length he sprang aside:
482,THE LAY OF THRYM,“Why are her eyes so full of ire?
483,THE LAY OF THRYM,Methinks they are darting sparks of fire!”
484,THE LAY OF THRYM,
485,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Sitting apart, the wily maid"
486,THE LAY OF THRYM,Answered what the Giant said:
487,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“This se’nnight past no sleep had she,"
488,THE LAY OF THRYM,So fain she was to come to thee!”
489,THE LAY OF THRYM,
490,THE LAY OF THRYM,"The Giant’s sister entered in,"
491,THE LAY OF THRYM,Greedy a bridal-gift to win:
492,THE LAY OF THRYM,"“Give me thy ring of red, red gold,"
493,THE LAY OF THRYM,If thou my love wouldst have and hold!”
494,THE LAY OF THRYM,
495,THE LAY OF THRYM,"The King o’ the Giants, he up and cried:"
496,THE LAY OF THRYM,“Bear in the hammer to hallow the bride!
497,THE LAY OF THRYM,"To the maiden’s knees now Miöllni bring,"
498,THE LAY OF THRYM,And Var shall hallow our hand-fasting.”
499,THE LAY OF THRYM,
500,THE LAY OF THRYM,"Deep in his breast laughed the heart of Thor,"
501,THE LAY OF THRYM,When his hammer he held once more!
502,THE LAY OF THRYM,"He slew the King o’ Giants, Thrym,"
503,THE LAY OF THRYM,And all his race smote after him.
504,THE LAY OF THRYM,"He smote the Giant’s sister old,"
505,THE LAY OF THRYM,She who begged a gift of gold--
506,THE LAY OF THRYM,"For pence, a pound was what she won,"
507,THE LAY OF THRYM,And a hammer-blow for a gay guerdòn!
508,THE LAY OF THRYM,
509,THE LAY OF THRYM,Thus back to his hammer came Odin’s son!

523,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,All up in the northern land;
524,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Unto the King of Norroway
525,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,He’s given his daughter’s hand.
526,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,(Woe was her heart in the winter!)
527,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
528,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,All for the King of Norroway
529,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,They spread the bridal-feast--
530,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,But it was young Sir Biörn
531,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,The maiden loved the best.
532,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
533,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Up spake the King of Norroway
534,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Before the blithe bridàle--
535,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“Why weeps she, haughty Hyldelil?"
536,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Why is her cheek so pale?”
537,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
538,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"He spake, the King of Norroway,"
539,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Unto his pages three--

541,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,And speak a word to me.”
542,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
543,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"In came he, young Sir Biörn,"
544,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,And stood before the board:
545,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“What wilt thou, King of Norroway,"
546,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,That thou hast sent me word?”
547,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
548,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“Now hearken, young Sir Biörn,"
549,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Thou knight so fair and fine!
550,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"Say, wilt thou be my seneschal,"
551,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,And pour my bridal wine?”
552,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
553,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“Yea, fain will I be seneschal"
554,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"All at thy bridal fair,"
555,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"If I may pour the red, red wine,"
556,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Before the bride to bear.”
557,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
558,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"Sir Biörn poured the mead so brown,"
559,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"And poured the red, red wine;"
560,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"The bride she sat full sorrowful,"
561,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,And wept for dule and pine.
562,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
563,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,It was the young Sir Biörn
564,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"That leaned across the board,"
565,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,And whispered to that weeping bride
566,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Full many a wooing word:
567,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
568,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“Dost mind now, haughty Hyldelil,"
569,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"What passed between us both,"
570,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"When, sitting in thy maiden’s bower,"
571,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Thou plightedst me thy troth?”
572,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
573,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"The bride she sat so sorrowful,"
574,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,And ne’er a word she said--
575,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"But her fair face grew white and wan,"
576,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,That as a rose was red.
577,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
578,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Up spake the King of Norroway
579,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,In purple wrapped and vair;
580,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“What sayest thou, oh young Sir Biörn,"
581,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Unto my bride so fair?
582,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
583,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“Away, thou young Sir Biörn!"
584,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Let be thy cozening tale!
585,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Her face that as a rose was red
586,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Is now grown wan and pale.”
587,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
588,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“There sitt’st thou, King of Norroway,"
589,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"A-drinking red, red wine!"
590,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,The lady that thou lovest
591,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Was first true love o’ mine!”
592,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
593,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,“And if the lady that I love
594,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"Has plighted troth to thee,"
595,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Then never will I bear her home
596,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,To Norroway with me.
597,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
598,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“Now tell me on thy faith and troth,"
599,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"What I shall ask, my bride!"
600,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"Wilt reign a queen in Norroway,"
601,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Or a dame in Denmark bide?”
602,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
603,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,“Liefer I’d bide a simple dame
604,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"A good knight’s name to bear,"
605,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"Than go with thee to Norroway,"
606,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,A queenly crown to wear!”
607,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
608,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,It was the King of Norroway
609,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,Smote hand upon the board--
610,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,“Ne’er have I known a knight’s daughter
611,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,That e’er spake such a word!”
612,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
613,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,It was the King of Norroway
614,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"That laughed, and made right merry--"
615,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"“And dost thou love him more than me,"
616,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,With him I trow shalt tarry!”
617,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
618,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"They rode away, the King his men,"
619,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"So sadly over the land,"
620,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,All but the young Sir Biörn
621,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,That won the maiden’s hand.
622,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,
623,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"They rode away, the King his men,"
624,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,So sadly over the ice--
625,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,"All but the young Sir Biörn,"
626,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,For he has won the prize!
627,THE NORSE KING’S BRIDAL,

637,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,She was the fairest maiden that e’er the sun shone on.
638,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"(Oh, oh, ha! all by the water wan!"
639,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,She was the fairest maiden that e’er the sun shone on.)

650,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"There came a cunning gipsy a-roaming to the town,"
651,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,They gave him gold and guerdon to bring her pride adown.
652,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
653,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"“Now lend to me a saddle, a mantle, and a beast,"
654,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"And I’ll ride a-wooing, as proud as any priest!”"
655,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
656,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"He rode, the cunning gipsy, unto the castle fair;"
657,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"There she stood, the maiden, a-combing of her hair."
658,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
659,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"“Good-morrow, my lady, so fair, and so fine!"
660,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"Say, wilt thou come to be true-love o’ mine?”"
661,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
662,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"“Away with thee, thou gipsy! I scorn thy words so free!"
663,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,Counts and mighty princes have come a-wooing me!”

680,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"“Where are thy goodly acres, and where thy lands so broad?"

688,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
689,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"“I have no dappled palfreys, a-tossing of their crest;"
690,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"But only my long hunting-knife, of all my goods the best!”"
691,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
692,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"And she may laugh, the lady, or she may weep for woe,"
693,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"But the gipsy she must follow, wherever he may go."
694,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,
695,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"The lady must turn up her silken sleeves so gay,"
696,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,And help that cunning gipsy the slaughtered beasts to flay.

698,THE GIPSY’S BRIDE,"Now must she quit her kirtle and her silken sark so fair,"

819,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Seven long years as a lowly squire
820,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,I served mine own liege-lord;
821,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,But of his daughter fair to see
822,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,They told me never a word.
823,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"(And is she glad, then I rejoice.)"

828,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,When she should go to Mass.
829,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,
830,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Thus it went from Easter
831,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,All unto Whitsuntide;
832,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,The maiden donned her fairest weed
833,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Unto the kirk to ride.
834,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,
835,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,The maiden donned her fairest weed
836,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Unto the kirk to ride;
837,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,I set my saddle on my steed
838,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,And went at the maiden’s side
839,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,
840,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"There, as I rode by the maiden’s side,"
841,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Like red gold shone her hair;

843,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,My heart was full of care.
844,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,
845,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,We rode across the lee-land
846,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"To the good greenwood amain,"
847,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,And never did my hand loose hold

850,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"“Hold off, hold off, thou fair young squire,"
851,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,And do not ride so near!

856,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,I dwell in dule and pine--

870,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"“Then come into the ladies’ bower,"
871,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"And stand thou not too near,"

874,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,
875,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"I went into the ladies’ bower,"
876,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Right sore afraid was I!
877,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,I looked not at my own true love
878,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Lest the serving-maid should spy.
879,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,
880,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,"She smiled, the lovely lady,"
881,THE LOWLY SQUIRE,Beneath her veil so thin;

1030,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“Bind him, Sir Dalebo, have him and hold!"
1031,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Bind him, Sir Dalebo Jonsen!”"
1032,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1033,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Up sprang the captains on their steeds of dapple grey,"
1034,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,And forth they galloped faster than a bird can fly away--
1035,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,For they knew not Dalebo Jonsen!
1036,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1037,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Now they are come to his castle fair and great,"
1038,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,And there stood his mother a-tarrying by the gate;
1039,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Show us Sir Dalebo Jonsen!”
1040,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1041,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“I cannot show you Dalebo, I know not where he be,"
1042,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,For it is seven years and more he rode away from me--
1043,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I can show him not, Dalebo Jonsen.”"
1044,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1045,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"The captain pulled off his cap of blue,"
1046,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,A thousand gold-pieces he told so true--
1047,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Now show us Sir Dalebo Jonsen!”
1048,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1049,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“To the east o’ the court, in the bower above,"
1050,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Sir Dalebo talks with his own true love;
1051,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Ye can find him there, Dalebo Jonsen.”"
1052,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1053,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,They knocked at the door with shield and with spear;
1054,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Up sprang Sir Dalebo: “Whom have we here?
1055,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Who are these?” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1056,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1057,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"He put on his armour all shining and bright,"
1058,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Little Kirsten she clasped it, the best that she might--"
1059,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Clasp it hard!” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1060,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1061,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Sir Dalebo out of the window sprang--
1062,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,His gold-hilted sword at his girdle rang--
1063,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“I come!” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1064,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1065,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"He struck down one, he struck down two--"
1066,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“’Tis thus the goodly game should go!
1067,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Doth it like ye?” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1068,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1069,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"He struck down three, he struck down four--"
1070,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“The game goes better than of yore!
1071,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,What think ye?” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1072,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1073,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Sir Dalebo he mounted his steed of dapple-grey,"
1074,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"And forth he galloped faster than a bird can fly away,"
1075,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Tread softly!” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1076,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1077,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Sir Dalebo has come to his castle fair and great,"
1078,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"There stood his mother, a-tarrying by the gate--"
1079,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Good-morrow!” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1080,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1081,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“Hearken, dear mother, to what I ask of thee!"
1082,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,What didst thou with the money my foemen paid for me?
1083,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I ask it, Sir Dalebo Jonsen.”"
1084,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1085,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“Ah, Dalebo, ah, Dalebo, and wilt thou work me woe?"
1086,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Never for all the world would I sell thee to thy foe--
1087,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I sold thee not, Dalebo Jonsen.”"
1088,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1089,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"He drew his shining sword, and struck her where she stood,"
1090,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,And all so small he hewed her as the beech-leaves in the wood--
1091,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Lie thou there!” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1092,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1093,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Sir Dalebo he mounted his steed of dapple-grey,"
1094,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,And forth he galloped faster than a bird that flies away--
1095,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,For wroth was Sir Dalebo Jonsen.
1096,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1097,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,Sir Dalebo has ridden to the castle fair and great;
1098,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"There stood the King o’ Danes, a-tarrying by the gate."
1099,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,“Good greeting!” said Dalebo Jonsen.
1100,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1101,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“Hearken now, Sir Dalebo, and look thou tell to me!"
1102,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Where are they, my champions, I sent of late to thee?"
1103,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"Tell me that, Sir Dalebo Jonsen!”"
1104,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1105,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“Oh some of them are sick, and some of them are sore,"
1106,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"And some are lying still, to rise again no more,"
1107,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,That thou sentest to Dalebo Jonsen.
1108,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1109,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“Go then, get thy salt, bid thy scullions ready be,"
1110,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,If thou wilt salt the flesh that I have carved for thee!
1111,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I rede thee, Sir Dalebo Jonsen.”"
1112,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1113,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“I pray thee, dear Sir Dalebo, now sheathe thy shining brand!"
1114,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,For freely will I give thee mine only daughter’s hand!
1115,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I pray thee, Sir Dalebo Jonsen!”"
1116,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,
1117,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"“What reck I of your wenches, or your serving-maids so gay?"
1118,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I have mine own true sweetheart, that’s fairer far than they!"
1119,SIR DALEBO’S VENGEANCE,"I say it, Dalebo Jonsen!”"

1198,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Agnes she walked on the cliff so steep;
1199,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Up came a merman out of the deep.
1200,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"(Ha, ha, ha!"
1201,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Up came a merman out of the deep.)
1202,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1203,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Hearken now, Agnes, so fair and so fine!"
1204,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"Say, wilt thou come to be true love o’ mine?”"
1205,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1206,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Yes, good sooth, that will I be--"
1207,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,But how can I dwell in the depths of the sea?”
1208,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1209,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"He has stopped her ears, and stopped her mouth as well;"
1210,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"So he bore her down, all in the sea to dwell."
1211,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1212,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,She dwelt with the merman eight years and more--
1213,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Seven fair sons to him she bore.
1214,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1215,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"Agnes she sat by the cradle and sang,"
1216,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,And she heard how the bells of England rang.
1217,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1218,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Unto the merman she then did say:
1219,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,“May I go up to the kirk to pray?”
1220,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1221,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Yes, thou shalt go, and pray withal;"
1222,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,But see thou come back to thy children small.
1223,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1224,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“When thou hast entered the kirkyard fair,"
1225,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Then shalt thou not let down thy shining golden hair.
1226,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1227,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“And when thou hast entered the door so wide,"
1228,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Then sit not down by thy mother’s side.
1229,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1230,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“When the priest names the Name of dread,"

1232,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1233,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"He has stopped her ears, and stopped her mouth amain;"
1234,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,So he bore her up to the English strand again.
1235,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1236,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"When she came to the kirkyard fair,"
1237,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Then she let down her shining golden hair.
1238,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1239,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"And when she entered the door so wide,"
1240,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,She sat her down by her mother’s side.
1241,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1242,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"When she heard the Name of dread,"
1243,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Then she bowed down her head.
1244,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1245,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Hearken now, Agnes, to what I ask of thee--"
1246,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Where hast thou been eight years away from me?”
1247,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1248,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,“I dwelt in the sea eight years and more;
1249,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Seven sons so fair I to the merman bore.”
1250,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1251,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Tell me, dear daughter, and fear no blame,"
1252,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,What did he give for thy maiden fame?”
1253,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1254,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,“He gave me a ring of golden sheen--
1255,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Never a better one hath the queen.
1256,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1257,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,“Of golden shoon he gave me a pair--
1258,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Never a better the queen may wear.
1259,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1260,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“He gave me a harp of gold so gay,"
1261,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"That I might play upon, to drive my cares away.”"
1262,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1263,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,The merman he made him a path so straight
1264,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Up from the strand to the kirkyard gate.
1265,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1266,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"Into the kirk he went, that selfsame day,"
1267,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"And all the holy images, they turned their heads away."
1268,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1269,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"Like the red, red gold was his shining hair;"
1270,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,His eyes were full of sorrow and care.
1271,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1272,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Hearken now, Agnes, hearken unto me!"
1273,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,All thy little children are longing after thee.”
1274,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1275,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Let them long as they will, yea, let them long so sore!"
1276,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,I shall return to them never more.”
1277,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1278,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“Think of the big ones, and think of the small!"
1279,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Of the baby in the cradle think thou most of all.”
1280,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,
1281,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,"“I think not of the big ones, I think not of the small!"
1282,AGNES AND THE MERMAN,Of the baby in the cradle I’ll think no more at all.”

1327,MORS JANUA VITÆ,The time was come for mirth.
1328,MORS JANUA VITÆ,"No place, by that glad hearth,"

1330,MORS JANUA VITÆ,For care funereal.

1340,MORS JANUA VITÆ,Of dreams that went and came--
1341,MORS JANUA VITÆ,But by the sleeper’s head
1342,MORS JANUA VITÆ,An angel watched the bed;
1343,MORS JANUA VITÆ,His pure and piercing glance
1344,MORS JANUA VITÆ,Was like a sword of flame.

1412,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Walked in the blowing meads,"
1413,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"And she marked how the tide came in from sea,"
1414,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And whispered among the reeds.
1415,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1416,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"The tide so free came in from sea,"

1420,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1421,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Ragnar the rover leapt to land

1429,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,His secret thoughts she found.
1430,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1431,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"And all the tale he might not tell,"
1432,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"The lore of the North and the South,"
1433,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Was in the look of his eyes, and the kiss"
1434,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,That he pressed on her trembling mouth.
1435,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1436,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Up and spake the mermaiden,"
1437,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Beneath the keel did swim:

1440,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1441,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"The mermaid fell, she spoke a spell,"

1445,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,

1449,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,She vanished from out his arm.
1450,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1451,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,It was the mermaid fair and fell
1452,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,That sang by the good ship’s side
1453,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“Ho, ho, for the kiss of the salt sea-spray,"
1454,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And the toss o’ the turning tide!”
1455,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1456,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Alone in the mead the maiden stood
1457,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Like one in a waking dream;

1462,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1463,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,“Oh the gulls fly out with the turning tide

1467,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1468,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"When days were done and years came on,"
1469,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Her sire did speak and say:
1470,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,“Let bells be rung and Mass be sung
1471,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,For a blithesome bridal-day!”
1472,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1473,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,“Oh sweeter to me the wind from sea
1474,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"That whispers among the reeds,"
1475,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Than the wooing words of a bridegroom blithe,"
1476,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Or the tramp of the festal steeds!”
1477,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1478,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Up and spake the groom so gay:
1479,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“Come, pour the red, red wine!"
1480,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Play up, play up, ye minstrel men,"
1481,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,To cheer this bride o’ mine!
1482,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1483,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“For the evening-star, like a bridal lamp,"
1484,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Over the tower doth stand;
1485,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,While thin and pale as a wedding-veil
1486,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,The mist steals o’er the land.”
1487,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1488,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"She let the golden cup fall down,"
1489,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And stared as she were wood;
1490,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“Oh is it wine ye pour for me,"
1491,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Or a beaker of red, red blood?"
1492,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1493,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,“Like a dirge for the dead is the music glad

1496,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Is white as a waiting shroud!”
1497,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1498,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Up and spake the mermaiden
1499,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,All under the waning moon:
1500,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“Ho, ho for the ship that sails at dawn,"
1501,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And sinks ere afternoon!

1506,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And I will have him yet!”
1507,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1508,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"It was Sir Ragnar, the rover bold,"
1509,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Clung to a floating spar
1510,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And drifted in with the turn o’ the tide
1511,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Across the harbour-bar.
1512,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1513,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Oh his look was shent, and his helm was bent,"
1514,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"And his mail was riven and brast,"
1515,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And the stream that was so clear before
1516,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Ran red where’er he passed.
1517,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1518,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Red, red his blood ran down the flood--"
1519,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"And, wavering, drowned, and dim,"
1520,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Like the face of death, from the dark beneath,"
1521,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,The cold moon stared at him.
1522,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1523,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Into the hall Sir Ragnar went--
1524,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"God wot, his face was pale!"
1525,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"The spray was on his dinted helm,"
1526,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,The red blood on his mail.
1527,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1528,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“Turn round, turn round, thou beauteous bride!"
1529,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Turn round and look on me!
1530,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"Say, wilt thou wed a living man,"
1531,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Or a dead man out o’ the sea?”
1532,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1533,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,She took him in her lily-white arms--
1534,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,She kissed him on the brow--
1535,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“I loved thee well for seven long years,"
1536,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,And well I love thee now!”
1537,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1538,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,It was Sir Ragnar laid him down
1539,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Dead at the maiden’s feet;
1540,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"She’s wrapped him in her bridal veil,"
1541,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,All for a winding-sheet.
1542,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1543,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Up and spake the shaven priest--

1548,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,“Cast out his corse to sink or swim

1552,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1553,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,Up and spake the mermaiden--

1557,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,
1558,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,"“Ho, ho! for see where he comes to"
1559,BALLAD OF THE TURNING TIDE,A-floating down so fast!

1580,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,
1581,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,"Beneath the sombre pine he has laid him down to sleep,"

1587,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,"“Lo, is it naught?” said the voice in the sobbing strings that sighed--"

1594,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,"And stirred his stiffened hair, and sighed from string to string,"
1595,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,
1596,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,"And sobbed into speech; “Is it naught,” the low voice singing said,"
1597,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,“Is it naught to thee at all that dust of uncounted dead
1598,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,
1599,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,“Is mixed in this lean grey soil? that on this moorland lone

1626,BALLAD OF ALL SOULS’ EVE,"“Oh for the age that I heard, dying alone in the dark,"

1718,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1719,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The King went forth at dawning
1720,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,To watch the turn of the tide:
1721,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"“Be still, my soul, be still!"
1722,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,To-day shall bring the bride.
1723,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1724,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"“Sea-gull, oh sea-gull,"
1725,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Stay thy shifting wings!
1726,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"Hast seen the ship a-sailing,"
1727,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,My love that brings?
1728,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1729,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,“The ship with sails of scarlet
1730,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Where threads of gold entwine--
1731,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"With maids and merry minstrels,"
1732,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"And gifts of mine,"
1733,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1734,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"“A veil for her head, and a girdle,"
1735,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"And a bracelet all of gold,"
1736,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Wrought by a cunning craftsman
1737,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,With labours manifold.”
1738,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1739,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The King went forth at even
1740,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,To watch the silver web
1741,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Woven by wavering moonbeams
1742,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Over the tide at ebb.
1743,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1744,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,“Oh nights are short in summer!
1745,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,She will come to me soon;
1746,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,To-morrow at dawn of day
1747,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Or at height of noon.”
1748,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1749,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Oh the sea grew hoary and grey
1750,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,At the turn of the year;
1751,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"The fire of the whin was faded,"
1752,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The heather was brown and sere.
1753,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1754,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,All the air was filled
1755,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,With the moan of the mourning main;
1756,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,And the ship with sails of scarlet
1757,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Came not home again.
1758,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1759,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The King went forth in the night--
1760,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,For care he could not sleep--
1761,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Down the perilous pathway--
1762,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Down to the edge of the deep.
1763,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1764,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,There was never a star to shine;
1765,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"Nor sea from shore he wist,"
1766,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Till he felt around his feet
1767,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The chill of the foam that hissed.
1768,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1769,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"There was never a star in the skies,"
1770,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,And the face of the deep was dim--
1771,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Yet he saw a wavering wanness
1772,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Like the cold moon sink and swim.
1773,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1774,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"Yea, as in the heart of the billow"
1775,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"Quivers the wan sea-flame,"
1776,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Drifting in the darkness
1777,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The mermaiden came.
1778,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1779,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"And on the long sea-swell,"
1780,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"Like to a foam-wreath pale,"
1781,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Among her locks a-floating
1782,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"He saw a costly veil,"
1783,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1784,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,That a queen might wear to wed in--
1785,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,And on her arm so cold
1786,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,He saw a gallant bracelet
1787,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"All of the gleaming gold,"
1788,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Wrought by a cunning craftsman
1789,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,With labours manifold.
1790,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1791,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,"Then the eyes of the King were darkened,"
1792,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,And his shuddering soul went down
1793,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Like a stone in the dark o’ the deeps
1794,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Where shipwrecked sailors drown.
1795,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1796,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The mermaid shimmering sank
1797,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Like a moon that clouds eclipse--
1798,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,And the spray of the salt sea mingled
1799,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,With the salt tears on his lips.
1800,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1801,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The King goes forth at even
1802,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,By the sea-side;
1803,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,He hears in the long dark caverns
1804,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,The sobbing of the tide.
1805,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,
1806,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Pale is the face of the King
1807,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Like one in a deadly swoon;
1808,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Wan o’er the waste of waters
1809,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,Glimmers the waning moon.
1810,THE BRIDE’S BRACELET,

1814,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD
1815,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1816,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1817,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Ho for the white of the withered bough
1818,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And the red of the wrinkled leaf!
1819,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Sir Arngrim sits in Ironwood,"
1820,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And his heart is filled with grief.
1821,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1822,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The sun sinks down on Ironwood
1823,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Blood-red behind the trees;
1824,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Sir Arngrim stares upon the sword
1825,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,That lies across his knees.
1826,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1827,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"“Oh my father died a death of blood,"
1828,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And my mother of wasting woe;
1829,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And their spirits dwell in the rocky fell
1830,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Where the trees of Ironwood grow.
1831,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1832,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,“And still the guilt of the life-blood spilt
1833,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Doth unavenged remain;
1834,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And in the red of the wrinkled leaf
1835,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,I read my father’s pain.
1836,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1837,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"“Oh the kings were three, sailed o’er the sea"
1838,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,To work us havoc and harm;
1839,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And I see in the white of the wizened bough
1840,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,My mother’s beckoning arm.”
1841,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1842,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Sir Arngrim stood with the sea beneath
1843,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"And the rocky fell behind,"
1844,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And there he saw three gallant ships
1845,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,That sailed before the wind.
1846,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1847,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"“Oh red of hand, they come to land"
1848,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,With a host and a mighty horde!
1849,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And how shall I wreak my father’s death
1850,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,With the power of a single sword?”
1851,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1852,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,When the writhen shadows in Ironwood
1853,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Grew long, and the fading rim"
1854,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Of the sun sank low behind the fell,"
1855,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The witch-wife came to him.
1856,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1857,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"“Now hearken to me, thou goodly knight!"
1858,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"And, if thou grant me grace,"
1859,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,I’ll work a spell shall serve thee well
1860,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,For love of thy fair young face.
1861,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1862,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,“Oh a maid am I from dawn till dusk--
1863,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"But by night of a magic rune,"
1864,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"And a weird of woe, a wolf I go"
1865,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,O’ nights beneath the moon.
1866,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1867,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,“Thou shalt slay three hosts in Ironwood
1868,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,That the wolf her fill may feed--
1869,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Then as lover true, when the fight is done,"
1870,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Shalt pay the maiden’s meed.”
1871,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1872,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Sir Arngrim looked upon the witch,"
1873,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And her face was fair to see.
1874,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,He’s plighted her troth on his knightly oath
1875,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And sealed it with kisses three.
1876,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1877,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,It was the first o’ the hosts came on
1878,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,With the rush of a roaring gale--
1879,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,But they might not stir the single sword
1880,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,That bit through bone and mail.
1881,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1882,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Oh half o’ the host at eve were slain,"
1883,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And half o’ the host were fled;
1884,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And all night long in Ironwood
1885,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The wolf howled o’er the dead.
1886,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1887,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,It was the second host came on
1888,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,As levin leaps from the sky;
1889,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,But they might not quell the witch’s spell
1890,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And the sword of grammarye.
1891,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1892,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Oh half o’ the host at eve were fled,"
1893,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And half in their blood lay still;
1894,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And all night long in Ironwood
1895,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The wolf did feed her fill.
1896,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1897,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,It was the third o’ the hosts came on
1898,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Like the waves of a winter sea;
1899,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,But they broke on the sword as billows break
1900,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Where the hidden skerries be.
1901,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1902,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Oh half o’ the host at eve were slain,"
1903,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And half were fled away;
1904,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"And like the dead, among the dead,"
1905,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,In a swoon Sir Arngrim lay.
1906,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1907,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The moon shone down on Ironwood
1908,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Above the trees so tall;
1909,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And lo! the red and wrinkled leaves
1910,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Upon his face did fall.
1911,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1912,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,And lo! the shade of the withered bough
1913,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"Across his face lay dim,"
1914,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"And the wolf she leapt, and seized, and tore"
1915,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The warrior limb from limb.
1916,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1917,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Ho ho for the red of the wrinkled leaf!
1918,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,His spirit has gone to dwell
1919,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,With the grimly ghosts of the ancient hosts
1920,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,That haunt the rocky fell!
1921,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1922,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Ho ho for the white of the withered bough!
1923,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,The witch she wails full sore;
1924,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,"And Ironwood, for that deed of blood,"
1925,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,Is accursèd evermore!
1926,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
1927,THE WOLF OF IRONWOOD,
