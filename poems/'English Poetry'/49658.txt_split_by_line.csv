98,I,A tent that is pitched at the base:
99,I,A wagon that comes from the night:
100,I,A stretcher—and on it a Case:
101,I,"A surgeon, who’s holding a light."
102,I,The Infantry’s bearing the brunt—
103,I,O hark to the wind-carried cheer!
104,I,A mutter of guns at the front:
105,I,A whimper of sobs at the rear.
106,I,"And it’s _War_!  ’Orderly, hold the light."
107,I,You can lay him down on the table: so.
108,I,Easily—gently!  Thanks—you may go.’

117,II,"A bottle that’s stuck by the pole,"

119,II,The flickering light of a soul
120,II,"On the wondering eyes of The Wreck,"
121,II,"And it’s _War_!  ’Orderly, hold his hand."
122,II,"I’m not going to hurt you, so don’t be afraid."
123,II,A ricochet!  God! what a mess it has made!’
124,II,And it’s _War_! and a very unhealthy trade.

213,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,_’Tis good that England’s soldier men_
214,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,_To-day can do the same._
215,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,
216,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They have proved their worth,"
217,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,To the ends of the earth.
218,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They have striven and won,—and failed!"
219,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They have shown their might,"
220,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"On the Dargai Height,"
221,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,When the _mollah’s_ bullets hailed.

226,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They have buried at night,"
227,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"By a lantern light,"
228,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,In a grave that they scooped in the sand.
229,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,
230,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"And far and wide,"
231,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They have done and died,"
232,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"By donga, and veldt, and kloof."
233,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"And the lonely grave,"
234,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Of the honoured brave,"
235,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Is a proof—if we need a proof,"
236,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They won—and died,"
237,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,And we glorified
238,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,The men of the barrack schools.
239,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"They died—and failed,"
240,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,And in wrath we railed
241,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,At the fault of the bungling fools!
242,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,
243,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,And perhaps it is good
244,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"That we change our mood,"
245,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"And perchance it is well to blame,"
246,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"And to seek elsewhere,"

248,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,The weight of our foolish shame.
249,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"But the fight hard fought,"
250,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,Must it go for nought
251,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,Because of its hapless turn?
252,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Must we then withhold,"
253,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"For the life hard sold,"
254,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,The Honour it died to earn?
255,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,
256,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"When hot and tired,"
257,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"With the last round fired,"
258,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,And never a ray of hope—
259,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,What then the shame?
260,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,They were just the same
261,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,Who charged Talana’s slope!
262,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"You may give and take,"
263,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"As the shrapnels rake,"
264,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,When your batt’ry has replied;
265,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,But you cannot live
266,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"When there’s too much give,"

269,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Good men are they,"
270,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Who gain the day,—"
271,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"And victory is sweet,—"
272,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,And just as brave
273,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,Who do not rave
274,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,At every small defeat.
275,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,For the fight hard fought
276,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Must not go for nought,"
277,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,Because of its hapless turn;
278,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"Nor we withhold,"
279,*NICHOLSON’S NEK*,"For the life hard sold,"
