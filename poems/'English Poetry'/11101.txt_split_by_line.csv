120,I. THE BEGINNINGS,I. THE BEGINNINGS
121,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
122,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
123,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Coleridge lived in what may safely be called the most momentous period
124,I. THE BEGINNINGS,of modern history. In the year following his birth Warren Hastings was
125,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"appointed first governor-general of India, where he maintained English"
126,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"empire during years of war with rival nations, and where he committed"
127,I. THE BEGINNINGS,those acts of cruelty and tyranny which called forth the greatest
128,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"eloquence of the greatest of English orators, in the famous impeachment"
129,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"trial at Westminster, when Coleridge was a sixteen-year-old schoolboy in"
130,I. THE BEGINNINGS,London. A few years before his birth the liberal philosophy of France
131,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"had found a popular voice in the writings of Rousseau, which became the"
132,I. THE BEGINNINGS,gospel of revolution throughout Europe in Coleridge's youth and early
133,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"manhood. ""The New Héloise"" in the field of sentiment and of the relation"
134,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"of the sexes, ""The Social Contract"" In political theory, and ""Émile"" in"
135,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"matters of education, were books whose influence upon Coleridge's"
136,I. THE BEGINNINGS,generation it would be hard to estimate. When Coleridge was four years
137,I. THE BEGINNINGS,old the English colonies in America declared their independence and
138,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"founded a new nation upon the natural rights of man,--a nation that has"
139,I. THE BEGINNINGS,grown to be the mightiest and most beneficent on the globe. Coleridge
140,I. THE BEGINNINGS,was seventeen when the French Revolution broke out; he was forty-three
141,I. THE BEGINNINGS,when Napoleon was sent to St. Helena. He saw the whole career of the
142,I. THE BEGINNINGS,greatest political upheaval and of the greatest military genius of the
143,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"modern world. Fox, Pitt, and Burke,--the greatest Liberal orator, the"
144,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"greatest Parliamentary leader, and the greatest philosophic statesman"
145,I. THE BEGINNINGS,that England has produced--were at the height of their glory when
146,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Coleridge went up to Cambridge in 1791.
147,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
148,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"In literature--naturally, since literature is but an interpretation of"
149,I. THE BEGINNINGS,life--the age was not less remarkable. Dr. Johnson was still alive when
150,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Coleridge came up to school at Christ's Hospital, Goldsmith had died"
151,I. THE BEGINNINGS,eight years before. But a new spirit was abroad in the younger
152,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"generation. Macpherson's ""Fingal,"" alleged to be a translation from the"
153,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"ancient Gaelic poet Ossian, had appeared in 1760; Thomas Percy's"
154,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"""Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,"" a collection of folk-ballads and"
155,I. THE BEGINNINGS,rude verse-romances such as the common people cherished but critics had
156,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"long refused to consider as poetry, was published in 1765. These two"
157,I. THE BEGINNINGS,books were of prime importance in fostering a new taste in
158,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"literature,--a love of natural beauty, of simplicity, and of rude"
159,I. THE BEGINNINGS,strength. The new taste hailed with delight the appearance of a native
160,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"lyric genius in Burns, whose first volume of poems was printed in 1786."
161,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"It welcomed also the homely, simple sweetness, what Coleridge and Lamb"
162,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"called the ""divine chit-chat,"" of Cowper, whose ""Task"" appeared in the"
163,I. THE BEGINNINGS,preceding year. But it was in Coleridge himself and his close
164,I. THE BEGINNINGS,contemporaries and followers that the splendor of the new poetry showed
165,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"itself. He was two years younger than Wordsworth, a year younger than"
166,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Scott; he was sixteen at the birth of Byron, twenty at that of Shelley,"
167,I. THE BEGINNINGS,twenty-four at that of Keats; and he outlived all of them except
168,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Wordsworth. His genius blossomed early. ""The Ancient Mariner,"" his"
169,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"greatest poem, was published some years before Wordsworth's ""Ode on the"
170,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Intimations of Immortality"" was written, or Scott's ""Lay of the Last"
171,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Minstrel."" He was in the prime of life, or what should have been the"
172,I. THE BEGINNINGS,prime of life--forty years old--when Byron burst into sudden fame with
173,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"the first two cantos of ""Childe Harold"" in 1812; he was forty-six when"
174,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Keats published ""Endymion""; he was fifty-one when Shelley was drowned."
175,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"And of all this gifted company Coleridge, though not the strongest"
176,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"character or the most prolific poet, was the profoundest intellect and"
177,I. THE BEGINNINGS,the _most originative poetic spirit_.
178,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
179,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"There was little hint, however, of future greatness or of fellowship"
180,I. THE BEGINNINGS,with great names in his birth and early circumstances. His father was a
181,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"country clergyman and schoolmaster in the village of Ottery St. Mary, in"
182,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Devonshire, a simple-hearted unworldly man, full of curious learning and"
183,I. THE BEGINNINGS,not very attentive to practical affairs. His mother managed the
184,I. THE BEGINNINGS,household and brought up the children. Both his parents were of simple
185,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"West-country stock; but his father, having a natural turn for study and"
186,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"having done well in his early manhood as a schoolmaster, went at the age"
187,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"of thirty-one as a sizar, or poor student, to Sidney-Sussex College,"
188,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Cambridge, took orders, and was afterwards given the living of Ottery"
189,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"St. Mary. Here he continued his beloved work of teaching, in addition to"
190,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"his pastoral duties, and by means of this combination won the humble"
191,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"livelihood which, through his wife's careful economy, sufficed for"
192,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"rearing his large family. Coleridge tells us that his father ""had so"
193,I. THE BEGINNINGS,little of parental ambition in him that he had destined his children to
194,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"be blacksmiths, etc."" (though he had ""resolved that I should be a"
195,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"parson""), ""and had accomplished his intention but for my mother's pride"
196,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"and spirit of aggrandizing her family."" Several of the children rewarded"
197,I. THE BEGINNINGS,their mother's care by distinguishing themselves in a modest way in the
198,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"army or in the church, but the only one about whom the world is curious"
199,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"now was the youngest of the ten, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was born"
200,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"at Ottery St. Mary, October 21, 1772."
201,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
202,I. THE BEGINNINGS,The essential traits of his later character appeared in his early
203,I. THE BEGINNINGS,childhood. Almost from infancy he lived in his imagination rather than
204,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"in the world of reality. ""The schoolboys drove me from play, and were"
205,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"always tormenting me, and hence I took no pleasure in boyish sports, but"
206,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"read incessantly.... I became a _dreamer_, and acquired an indisposition"
207,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"to all bodily activity; and I was fretful, and inordinately"
208,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"passionate."" ""Sensibility, imagination, vanity, sloth,"" were ""prominent"
209,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"and manifest"" in his character before he was eight years old. Such is"
210,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"his own account of his childhood, written to his friend Poole in 1797;"
211,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"and it is an accurate description, as far as it goes, of the grown man."
212,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"But of the religious temper, too, the love of freedom and of virtue, the"
213,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"hatred of injustice, cruelty, and falsehood that guided his uneven steps"
214,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"through all the pitiful struggle of his middle life, of the conscience"
215,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"that made his weakness hell to him--of these, too, we may be sure that"
216,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"the beginnings were to be seen in the boy at Ottery St. Mary, as indeed"
217,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"they were before his eyes in the person of his father, who, if not a"
218,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"first-rate genius, was, says his son, ""a first-rate Christian."""
219,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
220,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"The good vicar died in 1781; and the next year, a ""presentation"" to"
221,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Christ's Hospital having been secured for him, little Samuel, not yet"
222,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"eleven years old, went up to London to enter the famous old city school."
223,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Here,"
224,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
225,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"""In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,"""
226,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
227,I. THE BEGINNINGS,where he
228,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
229,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"""Saw nought lovely but the sky and stars,"""
230,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
231,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"one of some seven hundred Blue-Coat boys, Coleridge lived for nine"
232,I. THE BEGINNINGS,years.
233,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
234,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Most of the boys at Christ's Hospital, then as now, were given a"
235,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"""commercial"" education (which none the less included a very thorough"
236,I. THE BEGINNINGS,training in Latin); but a few of the most promising students were each
237,I. THE BEGINNINGS,year selected by the masters for a classical training in preparation for
238,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"the universities, whence they were known as Grecians. Coleridge was"
239,I. THE BEGINNINGS,elected a Grecian in 1788. The famous Boyer--famous for his enthusiasm
240,I. THE BEGINNINGS,alike in teaching the classics and in wielding the birch--laid the
241,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"foundation of Coleridge's later scholarship. Here, too, Coleridge did a"
242,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"great amount of reading not laid down in the curriculum,--Latin and"
243,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Greek poetry and philosophy, mediaeval science and metaphysics--and won"
244,I. THE BEGINNINGS,the approval of his teachers by the excellence of his verses in Greek
245,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"and Latin, such as boys at school and students at the universities were"
246,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"expected to write in those days. In the great city school, as in the"
247,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Devonshire vicarage, he lived in the imagination, inert of body and"
248,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"rapacious of intellect; but he was solitary no longer, having found his"
249,I. THE BEGINNINGS,tongue and among his more intellectual schoolfellows an interested
250,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"audience. While yet a boy, he would hold an audience spellbound by his"
251,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"eloquent declamation or the fervor of his argument till, as Lamb, who"
252,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"was one of his hearers, tells us, ""the walls of the old Grey Friars"
253,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"re-echoed to the accents of the _inspired charity boy_!"" That is the way"
254,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"his conversation,--or monologue, as it often was,--affected not boys"
255,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"only, but men, and especially young men, to his dying day. He cast a"
256,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"spell upon men by his speech; upon his schoolfellows, upon young men at"
257,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"the universities in the Pantisocracy days, upon Lloyd and Poole at"
258,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Nether Stowey, upon earnest young thinkers in his last days at Highgate;"
259,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"so that even if he had never written ""The Ancient Mariner"" and the"
260,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"_Biographia, Literaria_ he would still be remembered for the inspiration"
261,I. THE BEGINNINGS,of his talk.
262,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
263,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Further details of the life at Christ's Hospital must be sought in
264,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Lamb's two essays, especially that on ""Christ's Hospital Five-and-Thirty"
265,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Years Ago."" In 1791, having secured a Christ's Hospital ""exhibition,"" he"
266,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"entered Jesus College, Cambridge."
267,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
268,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"His university life extended over three years, from October, 1791, to"
269,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"December, 1794. It was an unhappy time for him and an uneasy time for"
270,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"his respectable relatives, for reasons that were partly in his own"
271,I. THE BEGINNINGS,nature and partly in the temper of the times.
272,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
273,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Even Boyer's severe training, while it had made him a hard student and"
274,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"an unusual scholar for his years, had failed to give him what he most"
275,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"needed as a balance to his intellect and imagination, stability of"
276,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"character. There is evidence that after the first few months, during"
277,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"which the habits of his hard school life had not yet broken, the new"
278,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"liberty of university life led him into extravagance, if not"
279,I. THE BEGINNINGS,dissipation. Work he doubtless did (he won the Browne medal for a Greek
280,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"ode on the slave-trade in 1792), but fitfully, giving less and less"
281,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"attention to his regular studies and more to conviviality and, above"
282,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"all, to dreams of literary fame. He wrote verses after various models,"
283,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"sentimental, fanciful, or gallant; he was enthusiastic in praise of a"
284,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"contemporary sonneteer, the Rev. William Bowles, whose ""divine"
285,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"sensibility"" seemed to him the height of poetic feeling; and in"
286,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"connection with Wordsworth's younger brother Christopher, who entered"
287,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Cambridge in 1793, he formed a literary society that discussed, among"
288,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"other things, Wordsworth's volume of early poetry, ""Descriptive"
289,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Sketches,"" published in that year. Wordsworth himself was a Cambridge"
290,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"man, but had taken his degree in 1791 and gone abroad, so that the two"
291,I. THE BEGINNINGS,men whose personal friendship was to mean so much in English poetry did
292,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"not meet until 1796. Already in 1793, however, Coleridge had developed"
293,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"political theories, or rather sympathies, which were preparing him for"
294,I. THE BEGINNINGS,fellowship with Wordsworth.
295,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
296,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"The French Revolution, which, after years of preparation, took concrete"
297,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"shape in 1789, did not look to young Englishmen in 1791-4 as it looks to"
298,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"us now, nor even as it was to look to those same Englishmen in 1800. In"
299,I. THE BEGINNINGS,those first years warm-hearted young enthusiasts at the universities saw
300,I. THE BEGINNINGS,in the violence of their fellow-men across the Channel only the
301,I. THE BEGINNINGS,struggles of the beautiful Spirit of Liberty bursting the chains of
302,I. THE BEGINNINGS,age-long tyranny and corruption and calling men up to the heights to
303,I. THE BEGINNINGS,breathe diviner air.
304,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
305,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"""Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,"
306,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"But to be young was very Heaven!"""
307,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
308,I. THE BEGINNINGS,wrote Wordsworth afterwards; and in the glow of his young idealism he
309,I. THE BEGINNINGS,had gone over to France in the autumn of 1791 and was on the point of
310,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"throwing in his lot with the revolutionists, when his parents compelled"
311,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"his return by cutting off his supplies. And many who, like Coleridge,"
312,I. THE BEGINNINGS,merely watched from afar shared his faith that a new order of things was
313,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"to be established, wherein Love should be Law and man's inhumanity to"
314,I. THE BEGINNINGS,man become but a memory of things outworn.
315,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
316,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Less generous men, with a selfish interest in established privileges;"
317,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"timid men, who looked with terror upon any prospect of change; older and"
318,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"wiser men, who better understood the foundations of social order and the"
319,I. THE BEGINNINGS,nature of man--all these looked with distrust upon the revolutionary
320,I. THE BEGINNINGS,idealism that was spreading from France through the younger generation
321,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"of Englishmen. The new notions of liberty, it was felt, threatened not"
322,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"only the vested rights of property and the prescriptions of rank, but"
323,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"the Church, too, and religion. Some of the would-be reformers were"
324,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"avowed atheists; some (Coleridge and his friends, for instance, in the"
325,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Pantisocracy period) were communists. In general, they ascribed all the"
326,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"evils of society to ""institutions,"" and wanted them abolished."
327,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
328,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Just how far Coleridge had gone in this direction by the autumn of 1793
329,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"we do not know; far enough at least to disturb his view of the future,"
330,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"to worry his elder brother George, a clergyman and school-teacher, who"
331,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"had in some measure filled a father's place to the young genius, and,"
332,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"most important of all, to alarm and distress a gentle girl in London."
333,I. THE BEGINNINGS,For before he left Christ's Hospital for Cambridge he had become
334,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"intimate at the house of a Mrs. Evans, and most of the letters preserved"
335,I. THE BEGINNINGS,from his first two years at the University were addressed to her or to
336,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"one of her two daughters, Anne and Mary. With the latter Coleridge was"
337,I. THE BEGINNINGS,in love; and that she had some regard for him is apparent from a letter
338,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"she sent him in 1794. Before that, however, Coleridge had taken a step"
339,I. THE BEGINNINGS,that seemed likely to close at once his college career and his prospects
340,I. THE BEGINNINGS,of literary fame. The reasons have not been recorded: probably pecuniary
341,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"embarrassment, the yeasty state of his religious and political ideas,"
342,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"and impatience or despondency over his love-affair with Mary Evans,"
343,I. THE BEGINNINGS,combined to precipitate his flight; what we know is that he ran away
344,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"from Cambridge and in December, 1793, enlisted as a dragoon in the"
345,I. THE BEGINNINGS,army.
346,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
347,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Coleridge had hardly taken the step before he repented of it. His
348,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"letters to his brother George, who with other friends bestirred himself"
349,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"for Coleridge's release as soon as his whereabouts was discovered, are"
350,I. THE BEGINNINGS,rather distressing in their self-abasement. The efforts of his friends
351,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"were successful and in April he returned to the University, where a"
352,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"public admonition was the extent of his punishment, and he continued in"
353,I. THE BEGINNINGS,receipt of his Christ's Hospital exhibition.
354,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
355,I. THE BEGINNINGS,But Coleridge's college days were practically over. He was now nearly
356,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"twenty-two years old, and the revolutionary unrest which had doubtless"
357,I. THE BEGINNINGS,contributed to his first escapade soon resulted in the formation of
358,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"schemes that took him away from Cambridge for good and all. In June,"
359,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"1794, he made a visit to an old schoolfellow at Oxford. Here he met"
360,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Robert Southey of Balliol College. A friendship sprang up between them
361,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"out of which, before the end of the summer, grew the Utopian scheme of"
362,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Pantisocracy. A company of gentlemen and ladies were to emigrate to
363,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"America, take up lands in the Susquehanna valley, and there establish an"
364,I. THE BEGINNINGS,ideal community in which all should bear rule equally and find happiness
365,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"in a life of justice, labor, and love. The education of the young in the"
366,I. THE BEGINNINGS,principles of ideal humanity was an important part of the scheme. We are
367,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"reminded of the Brook Farm experiment in New England a generation later,"
368,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"which bears a daughter's likeness to Pantisocracy, the chief difference"
369,I. THE BEGINNINGS,being that the New England enthusiasts were mature men and women and
370,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"really put the idea into practice, whereas the Pantisocrats were for the"
371,I. THE BEGINNINGS,most part collegians and never got beyond the stage of talking and
372,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"writing about their plans. The scheme was further elaborated at Bristol,"
373,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"where Coleridge, returning from a vacation tour in Wales, again met"
374,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Southey, and at Bath, the home of Southey and of Southey's betrothed and"
375,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"her sister, Edith and Sarah Fricker--""two sisters, milliners of Bath,"""
376,I. THE BEGINNINGS,as Byron contemptuously called them.
377,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
378,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"To the other sister, Sarah, Coleridge rather precipitately engaged"
379,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"himself. His love for Mary Evans was not dead, but he seems to have"
380,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"despaired of winning her and to have determined, by uniting himself"
381,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"domestically with Southey and his friends, to make retreat from their"
382,I. THE BEGINNINGS,communistic scheme impossible. A few weeks later he is back at
383,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Cambridge, tortured apparently between his old love and his new"
384,I. THE BEGINNINGS,engagement. Mary Evans has written to him deploring his wild notions and
385,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"the mad plan of Pantisocracy, yet confident that he has ""too much"
386,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"sensibility to be an infidel."" Southey has reproved him rather sharply"
387,I. THE BEGINNINGS,for failing to write to his betrothed at Bath. Our next glimpse of him
388,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"is at London, discussing poetry and philosophy with Lamb at the"
389,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"""Salutation and Cat"" tavern and perhaps trying to get a sight of Mary"
390,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Evans. In December he is again at Bristol, in lively correspondence with"
391,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Southey about democracy, Pantisocracy, and poetry, but at the same time"
392,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"he addresses a last appeal to Miss Evans. Her answer is kind, but final;"
393,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"that chapter is closed, and Coleridge writes to Southey that he will ""do"
394,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"his duty,"" by which he means apparently that he will be faithful to"
395,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Pantisocracy and marry Sarah Fricker.
396,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
397,I. THE BEGINNINGS,The Pantisocracy scheme could not in the nature of things be long-lived.
398,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"As a matter of fact it lasted little more than a year, ending in a"
399,I. THE BEGINNINGS,rupture between the two leading spirits just when they became
400,I. THE BEGINNINGS,brothers-in-law. Coleridge spent the summer of 1795 in Bristol in
401,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"company with Southey, writing and lecturing. In October he was married"
402,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"to Sarah Fricker in ""St. Mary's Redcliff, poor Chatterton's church."" In"
403,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"November Southey married Edith Fricker and set sail for Lisbon, where"
404,I. THE BEGINNINGS,his uncle was the English chaplain; and Pantisocracy was dead.
405,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
406,I. THE BEGINNINGS,The break with Southey was the natural result of attempting to force
407,I. THE BEGINNINGS,through a scheme impracticable in itself and doubly impracticable for
408,I. THE BEGINNINGS,the men who conceived it. Its collapse did not altogether sever their
409,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"literary relations. The collaboration begun in ""The Fall of Robespierre"""
410,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"(Cambridge, 1794) was continued in Southey's ""Joan of Arc"" (1796), to"
411,I. THE BEGINNINGS,which Coleridge contributed the part afterwards printed (with some
412,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"additions) as ""The Destiny of Nations,"" and in Coleridge's first volume"
413,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"of ""Poems"" (Bristol, 1796). A more important contributor to this volume,"
414,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"however, was Charles Lamb, whose initials were appended to four of the"
415,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"pieces. A second edition appeared in June, 1797, with eleven additions"
416,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"from Coleridge besides verses by Lamb and Charles Lloyd, all under the"
417,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"title: ""Poems by S.T. Coleridge. Second Edition. To which are added"
418,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Poems by Charles Lamb, and Charles Lloyd."" The publisher of both"
419,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"editions was Joseph Cottle, a bookseller of Bristol, who played the part"
420,I. THE BEGINNINGS,of provincial Murray to the young poets in these years.
421,I. THE BEGINNINGS,
422,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Meanwhile Coleridge, after a period of lecturing and projecting, had as"
423,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"we have seen married Sarah Fricker, with whom he was now very much in"
424,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"love, and had begun housekeeping in a cottage at Clevedon near the"
425,I. THE BEGINNINGS,Bristol Channel. The beauty of the place and his happiness there are
426,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"celebrated in ""The Aeolian Harp"" and ""Reflections on Leaving a Place of"
427,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Retirement"" (better known by its opening words, ""Low was our pretty"
428,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"cot""). His next residence was in Bristol--rather a base of operations"
429,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"than a home, for Coleridge was on the road much of the time, lecturing,"
430,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"preaching, soliciting subscriptions for his political and philosophical"
431,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"paper ""The Watchman"" (which ran from March to May, 1796), and trying in"
432,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"various other ways to provide for his family, which was increased by the"
433,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"birth of a son in September, 1796. At last in December he secured the"
434,I. THE BEGINNINGS,little cottage at Nether Stowey in the Quantock Hills (south of the
435,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Bristol Channel, in Somerset), close to the house of his beloved friend,"
436,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"Thomas Poole, where he lived until his departure for Germany in"
437,I. THE BEGINNINGS,"September, 1798."

442,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
443,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,The Stowey period was the blossoming time of Coleridge's genius. All the
444,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"poems in this volume except the last four, and besides these ""This"
445,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Lime-Tree Bower My Prison,"" ""Frost at Midnight,"" and ""Fears in"
446,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Solitude""--the bulk of his achievement in poetry--were either written or"
447,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"begun in 1797 and 1798. It will be proper, then, to dwell a little on"
448,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"his circumstances, his friends, and his ideas during these two years."
449,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
450,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,The means of livelihood for himself and his family when he went to
451,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,Stowey were a subscription of about £40 that Poole and some friends got
452,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"together for him, £20 that Cottle paid for the second edition of the"
453,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"""Poems,"" the promise of £80 from the father of Charles Lloyd, who was to"
454,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"live with him and study under his direction, and such money as he could"
455,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"earn by reviews and magazine articles, which he estimated at £40 a year;"
456,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,not a munificent provision for a household of three adults and a child.
457,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,But the theories of the simple life that had made Pantisocracy seem a
458,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"feasible project still inspired him with confidence. ""Sixteen"
459,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"shillings,"" he wrote to Poole, ""would cover all the weekly expenses of"
460,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"my wife, infant, and myself. This I say from my wife's own"
461,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"calculations."" Further, he will support himself by the labor of his"
462,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"hands. ""If you can instruct me to manage an acre and a half of land, and"
463,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"to raise in it, with my own hands, all kinds of vegetables and grain,"
464,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,enough for myself and my wife and sufficient to feed a pig or two with
465,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"the refuse, I hope that you will have served me _most_ effectually by"
466,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"placing me out of the necessity of being served."" This was in December,"
467,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,just before he moved to Stowey. In February he wrote from his new home
468,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"to another friend: ""From seven till half past eight I work in my garden;"
469,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"from breakfast till twelve I read and compose, then read again, feed the"
470,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"pigs, poultry, etc., till two o'clock; after dinner work again till tea;"
471,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"from tea till supper, _review_. So jogs the day, and I am happy.... I"
472,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"raise potatoes and all manner of vegetables, have an orchard, and shall"
473,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"raise corn with the spade, enough for my family. We have two pigs, and"
474,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,ducks and geese. A cow would not answer the keep: we have whatever milk
475,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"we want from T. Poole."""
476,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
477,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,There is a suspicious regularity about this schedule. Lamb wrote from
478,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"London in January: ""Is it a farm that you have got? And what does your"
479,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"worship know about farming?"" His agricultural activity, in the month of"
480,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"February, must have been chiefly prospective; and we may safely assume"
481,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"that Poole supplied other things besides milk, and that the poet spent"
482,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"more time reading, dreaming, and talking than he did raising potatoes. A"
483,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,good deal of time must have been spent in the actual composition of his
484,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"poetry, including his play ""Osorio,"" which was written in 1797, and in"
485,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,studying the landscape beauties of the Quantocks. After the coming of
486,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,the Wordsworths to Alfoxden he spent much of the time walking between
487,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Alfoxden and Stowey, or further afield with Wordsworth and his sister."
488,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"""My walks,"" he wrote afterwards, ""were almost daily on the top of"
489,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Quantock, and among its sloping coombs. With my pencil and"
490,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"memorandum-book in my hand, I was making studies, as the artists call"
491,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"them, and often moulding them into verse with the objects and imagery"
492,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"immediately before my eyes."" This does not sound much like ""raising corn"
493,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"with the spade."""
494,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
495,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,On Sundays he would sometimes preach before such Unitarian
496,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"congregations, within walking distance, as cared to hear him. But as he"
497,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,would take no pay for his services his preaching contributed nothing
498,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"toward the support of his family. Lloyd, who was epileptic and subject"
499,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"to moody variation in his attachments, was but an irregular housemate"
500,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"after the first few months, and his contribution to the household"
501,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,expenses was correspondingly uncertain. The future looked so dark in
502,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"October, 1797, that in spite of misgivings and former scruples he had"
503,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"concluded that he ""must become a Unitarian minister, as a less evil than"
504,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"starvation."" Accordingly he was in Shrewsbury in January, 1798,"
505,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,preaching in the Unitarian church and on the point of accepting the
506,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"pastorate at a salary of £150 a year, when the sky brightened in another"
507,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"quarter. Thomas and Josiah Wedgwood, sons of the famous potter and"
508,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"friends of Thomas Poole, offered him an equal sum annually as a free"
509,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"gift. They were wealthy men, well able to afford it; they attached no"
510,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,condition to the gift except that he should devote himself entirely to
511,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"the study of poetry and philosophy, which was precisely what he wanted"
512,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"to do; and he was not long in determining to accept the offer. ""I"
513,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"accepted it,"" he wrote to Wordsworth while still at Shrewsbury, ""on the"
514,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"presumption that I had talents, honesty, and propensities to perseverant"
515,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"effort."" The propensities, alas, remained propensities, never acquiring"
516,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"the force of habit. The pension, however, continued to be paid in full"
517,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"until 1812, when Josiah Wedgwood withdrew his half of it. The other"
518,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"half, upon the death of Thomas Wedgwood in 1805, had been secured to"
519,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,Coleridge for life; and this annuity must have constituted the chief
520,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,reliance of Mrs. Coleridge for many years.
521,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
522,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"If Coleridge did not prosper financially, he was at least fortunate in"
523,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,his friends; and a man's friends are after all the best testimony to the
524,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"character of his mind and heart. When he went to Stowey in December,"
525,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"1796, he was again on good terms with Southey, though the enthusiasm of"
526,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"their first fellowship was gone. The friendship with Lamb, begun in"
527,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"their school-days and renewed at the ""Salutation and Cat"" in 1794, was"
528,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,maintained by an eager correspondence and by Lamb's visit to Stowey in
529,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"July, 1797; and although Lloyd's vagaries led to a coolness between the"
530,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"old friends in the following year, the breach was soon healed, and the"
531,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,friendship continued till death. Another with whom Coleridge maintained
532,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"a voluminous correspondence in 1796-7 was John Thelwall, theoretical"
533,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"democrat, atheist, and admirer of Godwin, whose visit to Coleridge and"
534,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,Wordsworth in the summer of 1797 so shocked the good conservatives of
535,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,the neighborhood that Wordsworth had to leave Alfoxden in consequence of
536,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,it. But without doubt the dearest and most influential friend Coleridge
537,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,had before the Wordsworths came into his life was Thomas Poole. It was
538,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,in order to be in daily intercourse with Poole that he moved to Stowey;
539,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"and Poole's hesitation about securing the cottage for him, arising,"
540,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Coleridge seemed to fear, from imperfect confidence and friendship, was"
541,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,a source of agonized apprehension to the sensitive poet. When we
542,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"consider that Poole was a self-educated man, a Somersetshire tanner with"
543,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"no claim to literary genius or philosophical acquirements, Coleridge's"
544,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,devotion to him and dependence on him bring out in a strong light the
545,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"substantial, elemental character of the man. ""O Poole!"" Coleridge wrote"
546,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"to him from Germany afterwards, ""you are a noble heart as ever God"
547,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"made!"" Poole had indeed in a marked degree the genius for friendship."
548,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Strength of character, sympathy, and self-effacing devotion, combined"
549,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"with prudence and sincerity, made this man a tower of refuge for the"
550,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,unstable spirit of the poet.
551,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
552,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"No other single relation, however, can compare in importance, for"
553,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Coleridge's poetic development, with that which sprang up in the summer"
554,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,of 1797 between him and William Wordsworth. Just when they first met is
555,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,not recorded. We have seen that Coleridge was acquainted with
556,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Wordsworth's younger brother in his college days, and discussed with him"
557,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Wordsworth's first published poems. In January, 1797, he told Cottle"
558,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"that he wished to submit his ""Visions of the Maid of Arc"" to Wordsworth"
559,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,for criticism. The earliest definite record of their personal
560,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,acquaintance is a letter Coleridge wrote to Cottle while on a visit to
561,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,Wordsworth at Racedown (just over the Somerset border in Dorsetshire)
562,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,early in June. About the beginning of July he is again at Racedown; and
563,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,when he returns he brings Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy with him for
564,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,a visit. On the 7th Lamb arrived for his long-planned reunion with
565,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Coleridge. The second week of July, 1797, was thus a rich and"
566,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"long-remembered time for all of them, despite the fact that Mrs."
567,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Coleridge ""accidentally emptied a skillet of boiling milk"" on her"
568,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"husband's foot, which confined him ""during the whole time of Charles"
569,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Lamb's stay."" The others took long walks in the neighborhood, amid such"
570,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"scenery as is described in ""This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison,"" a poem"
571,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"that admirably voices the happiness, of those days of spiritual"
572,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"fellowship. The Wordsworths did not return to Racedown. ""By a"
573,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"combination of curious circumstances a gentleman's seat, with a park and"
574,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"woods, elegantly and completely furnished,... in the most beautiful and"
575,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"romantic situation by the seaside, four miles from Stowey--this we have"
576,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"got for Wordsworth at the _rent of twenty-three pounds a year, taxes"
577,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"included_!"" Coleridge triumphantly announced to Southey; and in this"
578,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"house, the Manor of Alfoxden, the Wordsworths remained for a year, in"
579,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,daily companionship with Coleridge and surrounded by scenes of natural
580,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,beauty that have left a lasting mark on the work of both poets.
581,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
582,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,What the friendship with Coleridge meant to Wordsworth may best be seen
583,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"in ""The Prelude: or, Growth of a Poet's Mind,"" Wordsworth's greatest"
584,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"long poem, written some years afterwards and addressed throughout to"
585,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,Coleridge.
586,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
587,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"""There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,"
588,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"No languor, no dejection, no dismay,"
589,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"No absence scarcely can there be, for those"
590,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Who love as we do."""
591,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
592,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,What Wordsworth was to Coleridge is more important for us here. The
593,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,admiration which the brilliant child of genius felt for the great
594,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"preacher-poet is chiefly, one feels, an admiration for his character. As"
595,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"a matter of fact, Wordsworth had written nothing, up to his coming to"
596,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Alfoxden, that would have preserved his name as a poet, nothing so"
597,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,noteworthy or promising as what Coleridge had already written. But
598,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Coleridge felt in this lean and thoughtful young man a strength of mind,"
599,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,a depth and sureness of heart that compelled his allegiance and even
600,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"imparted, for the time, some of that resolution in which he was by"
601,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,nature so sadly deficient. The character of their friendship is to be
602,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,seen not only in the published work of the two poets from this time on
603,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"(notably in ""Dejection""), but perhaps even more clearly in Dorothy"
604,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Wordsworth's Journal and in Coleridge's letters. ""I speak with"
605,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"heart-felt sincerity,"" he wrote to Cottle in June, 1797, ""and (I think)"
606,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"unblinded judgment, when I tell you that I feel myself _a little man by"
607,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"his side_, and yet do not think myself the less man than I formerly"
608,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,thought myself.... T. Poole's opinion of Wordsworth is that he is the
609,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"greatest man he ever knew; I coincide."" Wordsworth's influence is"
610,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"evident in a letter from Coleridge to his brother George in April, 1798:"
611,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"""I love fields and woods and mountains with almost a visionary fondness."
612,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,And because I have found benevolence and quietness growing within me as
613,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"that fondness has increased, therefore I should wish to be the means of"
614,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"implanting it in others, and to destroy the bad passions not by"
615,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"combating them but by keeping them in inaction."" Under the calming and"
616,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,clarifying influence of the stronger Northern spirit the fever of his
617,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"revolutionary dreams abated, he found happiness in the conscious"
618,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"exercise of his poetic powers, and for one year in his troubled"
619,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,existence his genius showed itself in all its splendor.
620,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,
621,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"The immediate poetic result of their friendship was the ""Lyrical"
622,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Ballads,"" published by Cottle in September, 1798. The origin of the work"
623,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"has been described both by Wordsworth (in a prefatory note to ""We Are"
624,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Seven"") and by Coleridge (in the _Biographia Literaria_, chap. xiv.). At"
625,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"first, they were to collaborate in writing a poem the proceeds of which"
626,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,should pay the expenses of a little tour they were making when the plan
627,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"was thought of, in November, 1797; and thus ""The Ancient Mariner"" was"
628,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"begun. As this poem grew under Coleridge's ""shaping-spirit of"

661,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,an eager visionary reformer upborne by generous enthusiasm and ardent
662,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"religious feeling. ""O! never can I remember those days,"" he wrote in the"
663,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"_Biographia_, ""with either shame or regret. For I was most sincere, most"
664,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,disinterested! My opinions were indeed in many and most important points
665,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"erroneous; but my heart was single. Wealth, rank, life itself, then"
666,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"seemed cheap to me, compared with the interest of (what I believed to"

692,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,Wordsworth gave his feelings a new object and his philosophy a higher

694,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"already quoted, Coleridge wrote: ""I have for some time past withdrawn"
695,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"myself totally from the consideration of _immediate causes_, which are"
696,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"infinitely complex and uncertain, to muse on fundamental and general"
697,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"causes, the 'causae causarum.' I devote myself to such works as encroach"
698,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"not on the anti-social passions--in poetry, to elevate the imagination"
699,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,and set the affections in right tune by the beauty of the inanimate

703,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"capable of becoming."" This last sentence is a sort of half-prophetic"
704,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"summary of his life's work; but the poetry soon gave way to the prose,"
705,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,and he never again so nearly realized his poetical ideal as he had

709,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"are various contemporary accounts. To Thelwall, in November, 1796, he"
710,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"sent the following description of himself: ""... my face, unless when"
711,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"animated by immediate eloquence, expresses great sloth, and great,"
712,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"indeed almost idiotic good-nature. 'Tis a mere carcass of a face; fat,"
713,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"flabby, and expressive chiefly of inexpression. Yet I am told that my"
714,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"eyes, eyebrows, and forehead are physiognomically good; but of this the"
715,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"deponent knoweth not. As to my shape, 'tis a good shape enough if"
716,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"measured, but my gait is awkward, and the walk of the whole man"
717,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,indicates _indolence capable of energies_.... I cannot breathe through
718,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"my nose, so my mouth, with sensual thick lips, is almost always open. In"
719,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"conversation I am impassioned, and oppose what I deem error with an"
720,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,eagerness which is often mistaken for personal asperity; but I am ever

723,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"remembered him as ""a tall, dark, handsome young man, with long, black,"

729,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"that every student of Coleridge's life and poetry should read),"
730,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,describing him as he appeared on his visit to Hazlitt's father at Wem in
731,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"1798, says: ""His complexion was at that time clear, and even bright. His"

735,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"chin good-humored and round, but his nose, the rudder of the face, the"
736,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"index of the will, was small, feeble, nothing--like what he has done."""
737,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,And Dorothy Wordsworth (to close with a contemporary and sympathetic
738,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,impression) set him down in her journal after their first meeting at
739,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"Racedown thus: ""He is a wonderful man. His conversation teems with soul,"
740,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"mind, and spirit.... At first I thought him very plain, that is for"
741,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"about three minutes: he is pale, thin, has a wide mouth, thick lips, and"
742,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"not very good teeth, longish, loose-growing, half-curling, rough black"
743,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,hair. But if you hear him speak for five minutes you think no more of
744,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"them. His eye is large and full, and not very dark, but grey[2]--such an"
745,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,eye as would receive from a heavy soul the dullest expression; but it
746,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,speaks every emotion of his animated mind; it has more of 'the poet's
747,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,eye in a fine frenzy rolling' than I ever witnessed. He has fine dark
748,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"eyebrows, and an overhanging forehead."" The friendly and keen-sighted"
749,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,woman gives a more sympathetic picture than the others; but there must
750,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"have been truth, too, in the view of the equally keen-sighted and less"
751,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"friendly Hazlitt, whose description accords well with Coleridge's"
752,II. AT NETHER STOWEY,"self-portraiture, and in the last sarcastic item, too well, with the"

859,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,narcotics and the inability to control his creative faculty are alike
860,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,symptoms of a temperamental malady which had its roots in his nature
861,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,close to the seat of that special faculty. Under a favorable conjunction
862,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"of outward circumstance and inward state, imagination came; it possessed"
863,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"him, and he labored in it, happily. Afterwards he could revise what he"

865,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,he could not proceed in the creative act after the inspiration had left
866,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"him. His own description of his nature--""_indolence capable of"
867,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"energies_""--is accurate as far as it goes. The opium, resorted to often,"
868,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"no doubt, to quicken the dreams in his brain as well as to relieve his"
869,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"bodily suffering, helped to enfeeble his will; but the ""indolence"" was"
870,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"in him before he became addicted to opium, and he was never ""capable of"

873,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,
874,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,Poetically it is perhaps as well. Had he been like his friend Wordsworth
875,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,in strength and steadiness of purpose--which is to suppose him another
876,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"nature than he was--his life would have been happier and more edifying,"
877,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"but he would hardly have given us anything better than ""Christabel"" and"
878,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"""The Ancient Mariner."" Romantic poetry of the higher type is essentially"
879,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,the creature of mood. Even Wordsworth's long and conscientious labors
880,III. THE REST OF THE STORY,"produced but a small bulk of poetry of this character, amid dreary"

921,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""",itself (to which of us I do not recollect) that a series of poems might
922,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","be composed of two sorts. In the one, the incidents and agents were to"
923,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","be, in part at least, supernatural; and the excellence aimed at was to"

928,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","under supernatural agency. For the second class, subjects were to be"

975,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","""The Ancient Mariner"" is not a ballad in the sense in which ""Sir Patrick"

1020,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","""I told her that in my opinion the poem had too much; and that the only,"
1021,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral"
1022,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""",sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a
1023,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""",work of such pure imagination. It ought to have had no more moral than

1025,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","the side of a well, and throwing the shells aside, and lo! a genie"

1028,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""",But the poet of 1798 knew better than the metaphysician of 1830. The

1034,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""",quite in accord with the simplicity which marked the whole conception of

1037,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","without the moral sense, and who have written poetry quite free from any"
1038,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","moral, like Poe and his landscape visions, but wonderful as they are,"

1040,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","It may be that Wordsworth, as one infers from recollections of the"
1041,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""","composition of the poem, suggested the moral plot; but if so it entered"
1042,"""THE ANCIENT MARINER""",at once and completely into Coleridge's imagination and governed the

1111,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","""Christabel"" and ""Kubla Khan"" were first printed in 1816, in a pamphlet"
1112,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","along with ""The Pains of Sleep,"" a sort of contrast to ""Kubla Khan"""
1113,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",composed in 1803. In the Preface to this pamphlet Coleridge informs us
1114,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","that the first part of ""Christabel"" was written at Stowey in 1797 and"
1115,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","the second part at Keswick, Cumberland, in 1800. The poem was intended"
1116,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","originally for the ""Lyrical Ballads,"" and it was with the hope of"
1117,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",finishing it for the second edition that Coleridge took it up again in
1118,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",the fall of 1800. There is a good deal of uncertainty as to just how
1119,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",much of the work was done at that time. In two letters of that period he
1120,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","speaks of it as ""running up to 1300 lines,"" and ""swelled into a poem of"
1121,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","1400 lines,"" so that it is no longer suitable for the ""Lyrical Ballads"";"
1122,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",but hardly half of this amount was printed in the 1816 pamphlet or has
1123,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",ever been found since. One suspects that already in 1800 dreams and
1124,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",projects had begun to be confounded with performance. In the latter of
1125,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","the two letters mentioned above he relates how his ""verse-making"
1126,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","faculties returned"" to him, after long and unsuccessful struggles with"
1127,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","""barrenness"" and deep ""dejection,"" as the result of drinking, ""at the"
1128,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","house of a neighbouring clergyman, ... so much wine, that I found some"
1129,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",effort and dexterity requisite to balance myself on the hither edge of
1130,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","sobriety."" On the whole, it seems probable that ""Christabel"" owes little"
1131,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",to the forced efforts of his first year in the Lake country. Like most
1132,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","of the other poems in this volume, it is a product of the great year at"
1133,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","Stowey. He himself told a friend in later years: ""I had the whole of the"

1187,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","Coleridge was fully aware of a special power, both of imagination and of"

1194,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","""The metre of the 'Christabel' is not, properly speaking, irregular,"
1195,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","though it may seem so from its being founded on a new principle: namely,"
1196,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","that of counting in each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the"
1197,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","latter may vary from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents will"
1198,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",be found to be only four. Nevertheless this occasional variation in
1199,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","number of syllables is not introduced wantonly, or for the mere ends of"
1200,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","convenience, but in correspondence with some transition, in the nature"
1201,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","of the imagery or passion."" This is not to be taken quite literally. The"
1202,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","accentual principle was assuredly nothing new in English verse, and"
1203,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","syllable-counting, though introduced by Chaucer, had to be reintroduced"
1204,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",by the Renaissance poets and did not become an unquestioned convention
1205,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",till the latter part of the seventeenth century. But the return to free
1206,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","accentual verse in the ""Christabel"" was an innovation at the beginning"
1207,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","of the nineteenth century. It is to be noted, too, that there are lines"
1208,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",of three and even of two accents in Part I.

1225,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a
1226,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects"
1227,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading

1230,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",stately garden thereunto. And thus ten miles of fertile ground were
1231,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",inclosed with a wall.' The author continued for about three hours in a
1232,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he"
1233,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than"
1234,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can be called
1235,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","composition in which all the images rose up before him as _things_,"
1236,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any"
1237,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",sensation or consciousness of effort. On awaking he appeared to himself
1238,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink,"
1239,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here"
1240,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",preserved. At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on

1242,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""","return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification,"
1243,"""CHRISTABEL"" AND ""KUBLA KHAN""",that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the

1824,PART IV,And drew my eyes away;
1825,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting deck,"
1826,PART IV,And there the dead men lay.
1827,PART IV,
1828,PART IV,"I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;"
1829,PART IV,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,                                    245"
1830,PART IV,"A wicked whisper came, and made"
1831,PART IV,My heart as dry as dust.
1832,PART IV,
1833,PART IV,"I closed my lids, and kept them close,"
1834,PART IV,And the balls like pulses beat;
1835,PART IV,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky                   250"
1836,PART IV,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
1837,PART IV,And the dead were at my feet.
1838,PART IV,
1839,PART IV,[Sidenote: But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.]
1840,PART IV,
1841,PART IV,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
1842,PART IV,Nor rot nor reek did they:
1843,PART IV,The look with which they looked on me
1844,PART IV,Had never passed away.
1845,PART IV,
1846,PART IV,An orphan's curse would drag to hell
1847,PART IV,A spirit from on high;
1848,PART IV,But oh! more horrible than that
1849,PART IV,Is a curse in a dead man's eye!
1850,PART IV,"Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,"
1851,PART IV,And yet I could not die.
1852,PART IV,
1853,PART IV,[Sidenote: In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the
1854,PART IV,"journeying Moon, and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move"
1855,PART IV,"onward; and every where the blue sky belongs to them, and is their"
1856,PART IV,"appointed rest, and their native country and their own natural homes,"
1857,PART IV,"which they enter unannounced, as lords that are certainly expected and"
1858,PART IV,yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.]
1859,PART IV,
1860,PART IV,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
1861,PART IV,And nowhere did abide:
1862,PART IV,"Softly she was going up,"
1863,PART IV,And a star or two beside--
1864,PART IV,
1865,PART IV,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main,"
1866,PART IV,Like April hoar-frost spread;
1867,PART IV,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
1868,PART IV,The charmed water burnt alway
1869,PART IV,A still and awful red.
1870,PART IV,
1871,PART IV,[Sidenote: By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the
1872,PART IV,great calm.]
1873,PART IV,
1874,PART IV,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
1875,PART IV,I watched the water-snakes:
1876,PART IV,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
1877,PART IV,"And when they reared, the elfish light"
1878,PART IV,Fell off in hoary flakes.
1879,PART IV,
1880,PART IV,Within the shadow of the ship
1881,PART IV,I watched their rich attire:
1882,PART IV,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
1883,PART IV,They coiled and swam; and every track                              280
1884,PART IV,Was a flash of golden fire.
1885,PART IV,
1886,PART IV,[Sidenote: Their beauty and their happiness.]
1887,PART IV,
1888,PART IV,[Sidenote: He blesseth them in his heart.]
1889,PART IV,
1890,PART IV,O happy living things! no tongue
1891,PART IV,Their beauty might declare:
1892,PART IV,"A spring of love gushed from my heart,"
1893,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware:                                        285
1894,PART IV,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
1895,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware.
1896,PART IV,
1897,PART IV,[Sidenote: The spell begins to break.]
1898,PART IV,
1899,PART IV,The selfsame moment I could pray;
1900,PART IV,And from my neck so free
1901,PART IV,"The Albatross fell off, and sank                                   290"
1902,PART IV,Like lead into the sea.
1903,PART IV,
1904,PART IV,
1905,PART IV,
1906,PART V,PART V
1907,PART V,
1908,PART V,"Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,"
1909,PART V,Beloved from pole to pole!
1910,PART V,To Mary Queen the praise be given!
1911,PART V,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,                             295"
1912,PART V,That slid into my soul.
1913,PART V,
1914,PART V,"[Sidenote: By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed"
1915,PART V,with rain.]
1916,PART V,
1917,PART V,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
1918,PART V,"That had so long remained,"
1919,PART V,I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
1920,PART V,"And when I awoke, it rained.                                       300"
1921,PART V,
1922,PART V,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
1923,PART V,My garments all were dank;
1924,PART V,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
1925,PART V,And still my body drank.
1926,PART V,
1927,PART V,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:                              305"
1928,PART V,I was so light--almost
1929,PART V,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
1930,PART V,And was a blessed ghost.
1931,PART V,
1932,PART V,[Sidenote: He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in
1933,PART V,the sky and the element.]
1934,PART V,
1935,PART V,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
1936,PART V,It did not come anear;                                             310
1937,PART V,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
1938,PART V,That were so thin and sere.
1939,PART V,
1940,PART V,The upper air burst into life!
1941,PART V,"And a hundred fire-flags sheen,"
1942,PART V,To and fro they were hurried about!                                315
1943,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
1944,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
1945,PART V,
1946,PART V,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
1947,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
1948,PART V,And the rain poured down from one black cloud;                     320
1949,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
1950,PART V,
1951,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
1952,PART V,The Moon was at its side.
1953,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
1954,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,                               325"
1955,PART V,A river steep and wide.
1956,PART V,
1957,PART V,"[Sidenote: The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired, and the ship"
1958,PART V,moves on;]
1959,PART V,
1960,PART V,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
1961,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
1962,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
1963,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.                                         330
1964,PART V,
1965,PART V,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,"
1966,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
1967,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
1968,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
1969,PART V,
1970,PART V,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;                           335"
1971,PART V,Yet never a breeze up blew;
1972,PART V,"The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,"
1973,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
1974,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
1975,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.                                            340
1976,PART V,
1977,PART V,The body of my brother's son
1978,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
1979,PART V,"The body and I pulled at one rope,"
1980,PART V,"But he said nought to me."""
1981,PART V,
1982,PART V,"[Sidenote: But not by the souls of the men, nor by daemons of earth or"
1983,PART V,"middle air, but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the"
1984,PART V,invocation of the guardian saint.]
1985,PART V,
1986,PART V,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!""                                    345"
1987,PART V,"""Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!"
1988,PART V,"'T was not those souls that fled in pain,"
1989,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
1990,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
1991,PART V,
1992,PART V,"For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,"
1993,PART V,And clustered round the mast;                                      350
1994,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
1995,PART V,And from their bodies passed.
1996,PART V,
1997,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
1998,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;                                            355
1999,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
2000,PART V,"Now mixed, now one by one."
2001,PART V,
2002,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
2003,PART V,I heard the sky-lark sing;
2004,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,                               350"
2005,PART V,How they seemed to fill the sea and air
2006,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
2007,PART V,
2008,PART V,"And now 't was like all instruments,"
2009,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
2010,PART V,"And now it is an angel's song,                                     365"
2011,PART V,That makes the heavens be mute.
2012,PART V,
2013,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
2014,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
2015,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
2016,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,                                        370"
2017,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
2018,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
2019,PART V,
2020,PART V,"Till noon we quietly sailed on,"
2021,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
2022,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,                                 375"
2023,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
2024,PART V,
2025,PART V,[Sidenote: The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship
2026,PART V,"as far as the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still"
2027,PART V,requireth vengeance.]
2028,PART V,
2029,PART V,"Under' the keel nine fathom deep,"
2030,PART V,"From the land of mist and snow,"
2031,PART V,The spirit slid: and it was he
2032,PART V,That made the ship to go.                                          380
2033,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
2034,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
2035,PART V,
2036,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
2037,PART V,Had fixed her to the ocean:
2038,PART V,"But in a minute she 'gan stir,                                     385"
2039,PART V,With a short uneasy motion--
2040,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
2041,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
2042,PART V,
2043,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
2044,PART V,She made a sudden bound:                                           390
2045,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
2046,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.
2047,PART V,
2048,PART V,"[Sidenote: The Polar Spirit's fellow-daemons, the invisible inhabitants"
2049,PART V,"of the element, take part in his wrong; and two of them relate, one to"
2050,PART V,"the other, that penance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been"
2051,PART V,"accorded to the Polar Spirit, who returneth southward.]"
2052,PART V,
2053,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
2054,PART V,I have not to declare;
2055,PART V,"But ere my living life returned,                                   395"
2056,PART V,I heard and in my soul discerned
2057,PART V,Two voices in the air.
2058,PART V,
2059,PART V,"'Is it he?' quoth one, 'Is this the man?"
2060,PART V,"By him who died on cross,"
2061,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low                                400
2062,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
2063,PART V,
2064,PART V,The spirit who bideth by himself
2065,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
2066,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
2067,PART V,Who shot him with his bow?'                                        405
2068,PART V,
2069,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
2070,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
2071,PART V,"Quoth he, 'The man hath penance done,"
2072,PART V,And penance more will do.'
2073,PART V,
2074,PART V,
2075,PART V,
2076,PART VI,PART VI
2077,PART VI,
2078,FIRST VOICE,FIRST VOICE
2079,FIRST VOICE,
2080,FIRST VOICE,"'But tell me, tell me! speak again, 410"
2081,FIRST VOICE,Thy soft response renewing--
2082,FIRST VOICE,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
2083,FIRST VOICE,What is the ocean doing?'
2084,FIRST VOICE,
2085,SECOND VOICE,SECOND VOICE
2086,SECOND VOICE,
2087,SECOND VOICE,"'Still as a slave before his lord,"
2088,SECOND VOICE,The ocean hath no blast; 415
2089,SECOND VOICE,His great bright eye most silently
2090,SECOND VOICE,Up to the Moon is cast--
2091,SECOND VOICE,
2092,SECOND VOICE,If he may know which way to go;
2093,SECOND VOICE,For she guides him smooth or grim.
2094,SECOND VOICE,"See, brother, see! how graciously 420"
2095,SECOND VOICE,She looketh down on him.'
2096,SECOND VOICE,
2097,FIRST VOICE,FIRST VOICE
2098,FIRST VOICE,
2099,FIRST VOICE,[Sidenote: The Mariner hath been cast into a trance; for the angelic

2102,FIRST VOICE,
2103,FIRST VOICE,'But why drives on that ship so fast?
2104,FIRST VOICE,Without or wave or wind?'
2105,FIRST VOICE,
2106,SECOND VOICE,SECOND VOICE
2107,SECOND VOICE,
2108,SECOND VOICE,"'The air is cut away before,"
2109,SECOND VOICE,And closes from behind. 425
2110,SECOND VOICE,
2111,SECOND VOICE,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"
2112,SECOND VOICE,Or we shall be belated:
2113,SECOND VOICE,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
2114,SECOND VOICE,When the Mariner's trance is abated.
2115,SECOND VOICE,
2116,SECOND VOICE,"[Sidenote: The supernatural motion is retarded; the Mariner awakes, and"
2117,SECOND VOICE,his penance begins anew.]
2118,SECOND VOICE,
2119,SECOND VOICE,"I woke, and we were sailing on                                     430"
2120,SECOND VOICE,As in a gentle weather:
2121,SECOND VOICE,"'T was night, calm night, the moon was high,"
2122,SECOND VOICE,The dead men stood together.
2123,SECOND VOICE,
2124,SECOND VOICE,"All stood together on the deck,"
2125,SECOND VOICE,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:                                      435
2126,SECOND VOICE,"All fixed on me their stony eyes,"
2127,SECOND VOICE,That in the Moon did glitter.
2128,SECOND VOICE,
2129,SECOND VOICE,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
2130,SECOND VOICE,Had never passed away:
2131,SECOND VOICE,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,                              440"
2132,SECOND VOICE,Nor turn them up to pray.
2133,SECOND VOICE,
2134,SECOND VOICE,[Sidenote: The curse is finally expiated.]
2135,SECOND VOICE,
2136,SECOND VOICE,And now this spell was snapt: once more
2137,SECOND VOICE,"I viewed the ocean green,"
2138,SECOND VOICE,"And looked far forth, yet little saw"
2139,SECOND VOICE,Of what had else been seen--                                       445
2140,SECOND VOICE,
2141,SECOND VOICE,"Like one, that on a lonesome road"
2142,SECOND VOICE,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
2143,SECOND VOICE,"And having once turned round walks on,"
2144,SECOND VOICE,And turns no more his head;
2145,SECOND VOICE,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend                                450"
2146,SECOND VOICE,Doth close behind him tread.
2147,SECOND VOICE,
2148,SECOND VOICE,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
2149,SECOND VOICE,Nor sound nor motion made:
2150,SECOND VOICE,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
2151,SECOND VOICE,In ripple or in shade.                                             455
2152,SECOND VOICE,
2153,SECOND VOICE,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek"
2154,SECOND VOICE,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
2155,SECOND VOICE,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
2156,SECOND VOICE,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
2157,SECOND VOICE,
2158,SECOND VOICE,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,                                    460"
2159,SECOND VOICE,Yet she sailed softly too:
2160,SECOND VOICE,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
2161,SECOND VOICE,On me alone it blew.
2162,SECOND VOICE,
2163,SECOND VOICE,[Sidenote: And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.]
2164,SECOND VOICE,
2165,SECOND VOICE,Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
2166,SECOND VOICE,The light-house top I see?                                         465
2167,SECOND VOICE,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
2168,SECOND VOICE,Is this mine own countree?
2169,SECOND VOICE,
2170,SECOND VOICE,"We drifted o'er the harbor-bar,"
2171,SECOND VOICE,And I with sobs did pray--
2172,SECOND VOICE,"O let me be awake, my God!                                         470"
2173,SECOND VOICE,Or let me sleep alway.
2174,SECOND VOICE,
2175,SECOND VOICE,"The harbor-bay was clear as glass,"
2176,SECOND VOICE,So smoothly it was strewn!
2177,SECOND VOICE,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
2178,SECOND VOICE,And the shadow of the Moon.                                        475
2179,SECOND VOICE,
2180,SECOND VOICE,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,"
2181,SECOND VOICE,That stands above the rock:
2182,SECOND VOICE,The moonlight steeped in silentness
2183,SECOND VOICE,The steady weathercock.
2184,SECOND VOICE,
2185,SECOND VOICE,And the bay was white with silent light                            480
2186,SECOND VOICE,"Till rising from the same,"
2187,SECOND VOICE,
2188,SECOND VOICE,"[Sidenote: The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,]"
2189,SECOND VOICE,
2190,SECOND VOICE,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
2191,SECOND VOICE,In crimson colors came.
2192,SECOND VOICE,
2193,SECOND VOICE,[Sidenote: And appear in their own forms of light.]
2194,SECOND VOICE,
2195,SECOND VOICE,A little distance from the prow
2196,SECOND VOICE,Those crimson shadows were:                                        485
2197,SECOND VOICE,I turned my eyes upon the deck--
2198,SECOND VOICE,"Oh, Christ! what saw I there!"
2199,SECOND VOICE,
2200,SECOND VOICE,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
2201,SECOND VOICE,"And, by the holy rood!"
2202,SECOND VOICE,"A man all light, a seraph-man,                                     490"
2203,SECOND VOICE,On every corse there stood.
2204,SECOND VOICE,
2205,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
2206,SECOND VOICE,It was a heavenly sight!
2207,SECOND VOICE,"They stood as signals to the land,"
2208,SECOND VOICE,Each one a lovely light;                                           495
2209,SECOND VOICE,
2210,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
2211,SECOND VOICE,No voice did they impart--
2212,SECOND VOICE,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
2213,SECOND VOICE,Like music on my heart.
2214,SECOND VOICE,
2215,SECOND VOICE,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,                                 500"
2216,SECOND VOICE,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
2217,SECOND VOICE,"My head was turned perforce away,"
2218,SECOND VOICE,And I saw a boat appear.
2219,SECOND VOICE,
2220,SECOND VOICE,"The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,"
2221,SECOND VOICE,I heard them coming fast:                                          505
2222,SECOND VOICE,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
2223,SECOND VOICE,The dead men could not blast.
2224,SECOND VOICE,
2225,SECOND VOICE,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
2226,SECOND VOICE,It is the Hermit good!
2227,SECOND VOICE,He singeth loud his godly hymns                                    510
2228,SECOND VOICE,That he makes in the wood.
2229,SECOND VOICE,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
2230,SECOND VOICE,The Albatross's blood.

2236,PART VII,"[Sidenote: The Hermit of the Wood,]"
2237,PART VII,
2238,PART VII,This Hermit good lives in that wood
2239,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.                                      515
2240,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
2241,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
2242,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
2243,PART VII,
2244,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
2245,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:                                           520
2246,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
2247,PART VII,The rotted old oak-stump.
2248,PART VII,
2249,PART VII,"The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,"
2250,PART VII,"'Why, this is strange, I trow!"
2251,PART VII,"Where are those lights, so many and fair,                          525"
2252,PART VII,That signal made but now?'
2253,PART VII,
2254,PART VII,[Sidenote: Approacheth the ship with wonder.]
2255,PART VII,
2256,PART VII,"'Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit said--"
2257,PART VII,'And they answered not our cheer!
2258,PART VII,"The planks looked warped! and see those sails,"
2259,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!                                        530
2260,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"
2261,PART VII,Unless perchance it were

2263,PART VII,Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
2264,PART VII,My forest-brook along;

2266,PART VII,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"

2268,PART VII,
2269,PART VII,'Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--

2272,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
2273,PART VII,
2274,PART VII,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
2275,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirred;
2276,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
2277,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.                                    545
2278,PART VII,
2279,PART VII,[Sidenote: The ship suddenly sinketh.]
2280,PART VII,
2281,PART VII,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
2282,PART VII,Still louder and more dread:
2283,PART VII,"It reached the ship, it split the bay;"
2284,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
2285,PART VII,
2286,PART VII,[Sidenote: The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat.]
2287,PART VII,
2288,PART VII,"Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,                           550"
2289,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
2290,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drowned
2291,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
2292,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
2293,PART VII,Within the Pilot's boat.                                           555
2294,PART VII,
2295,PART VII,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
2296,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
2297,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
2298,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
2299,PART VII,
2300,PART VII,I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked                                560
2301,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
2302,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
2303,PART VII,And prayed where he did sit.
2304,PART VII,
2305,PART VII,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
2306,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,                                             565"
2307,PART VII,"Laughed loud and long, and all the while"
2308,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
2309,PART VII,"'Ha! ha!' quoth he, 'full plain I see,"
2310,PART VII,The Devil knows how to row.'
2311,PART VII,
2312,PART VII,"And now, all in my own countree,                                   570"
2313,PART VII,I stood on the firm land!
2314,PART VII,"The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,"
2315,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
2316,PART VII,
2317,PART VII,[Sidenote: The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to

2319,PART VII,
2320,PART VII,"'O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!'"

2322,PART VII,"'Say quick,' quoth he, 'I bid thee say--"
2323,PART VII,What manner of man art thou?'
2324,PART VII,
2325,PART VII,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
2326,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"
2327,PART VII,Which forced me to begin my tale;                                  580
2328,PART VII,And then it left me free.
2329,PART VII,

2332,PART VII,
2333,PART VII,"Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
2334,PART VII,That agony returns:

2336,PART VII,This heart within me burns.                                        585
2337,PART VII,
2338,PART VII,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
2339,PART VII,I have strange power of speech;
2340,PART VII,"That moment that his face I see,"
2341,PART VII,I know the man that must hear me:

2355,PART VII,
2356,PART VII,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"

2536,PART THE FIRST,Took the key that fitted well;

2538,PART THE FIRST,All in the middle of the gate;
2539,PART THE FIRST,"The gate that was ironed within and without,"
2540,PART THE FIRST,Where an army in battle array had marched out.
2541,PART THE FIRST,"The lady sank, belike through pain,"

2543,PART THE FIRST,"Lifted her up, a weary weight,"
2544,PART THE FIRST,Over the threshold of the gate:

2548,PART THE FIRST,"So free from danger, free from fear,                               135"
2549,PART THE FIRST,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
2550,PART THE FIRST,And Christabel devoutly cried
2551,PART THE FIRST,"To the lady by her side,"
2552,PART THE FIRST,"""Praise we the Virgin all divine"
2553,PART THE FIRST,"Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!""                          140"

2555,PART THE FIRST,"""I cannot speak for weariness."""
2556,PART THE FIRST,"So free from danger, free from fear,"

2560,PART THE FIRST,"Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold."
2561,PART THE FIRST,"The mastiff old did not awake,"
2562,PART THE FIRST,Yet she an angry moan did make!
2563,PART THE FIRST,And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
2564,PART THE FIRST,Never till now she uttered yell                                    150
2565,PART THE FIRST,Beneath the eye of Christabel.
2566,PART THE FIRST,Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:

2568,PART THE FIRST,
2569,PART THE FIRST,"They passed the hall, that echoes still,"

2571,PART THE FIRST,"The brands were flat, the brands were dying,"

2573,PART THE FIRST,"But when the lady passed, there came"
2574,PART THE FIRST,"A tongue of light, a fit of flame;"
2575,PART THE FIRST,"And Christabel saw the lady's eye,                                 160"
2576,PART THE FIRST,"And nothing else saw she thereby,"
2577,PART THE FIRST,"Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,"
2578,PART THE FIRST,Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
2579,PART THE FIRST,"""O softly tread,"" said Christabel,"

2584,PART THE FIRST,"They steal their way from stair to stair,"

2604,PART THE FIRST,"She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,"
2605,PART THE FIRST,"And left it swinging to and fro,"

2616,PART THE FIRST,"Christabel answered--""Woe is me!"
2617,PART THE FIRST,She died the hour that I was born.
2618,PART THE FIRST,I have heard the gray-haired friar tell
2619,PART THE FIRST,"How on her death-bed she did say,"
2620,PART THE FIRST,That she should hear the castle-bell                               200

2627,PART THE FIRST,"I have power to bid thee flee."""

2638,PART THE FIRST,"""Alas!"" said she, ""this ghastly ride--"

2644,PART THE FIRST,"Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,"
2645,PART THE FIRST,"And from the floor whereon she sank,"
2646,PART THE FIRST,The lofty lady stood upright:

2654,PART THE FIRST,"Even I in my degree will try,"
2655,PART THE FIRST,"Fair maiden, to requite you well."
2656,PART THE FIRST,But now unrobe yourself; for I

2660,PART THE FIRST,"And as the lady bade, did she."
2661,PART THE FIRST,"Her gentle limbs did she undress,"
2662,PART THE FIRST,And lay down in her loveliness.
2663,PART THE FIRST,

2672,PART THE FIRST,And slowly rolled her eyes around;
2673,PART THE FIRST,"Then drawing in her breath aloud,"
2674,PART THE FIRST,"Like one that shuddered, she unbound"
2675,PART THE FIRST,The cincture from beneath her breast:

2683,PART THE FIRST,Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
2684,PART THE FIRST,Deep from within she seems half-way
2685,PART THE FIRST,"To lift some weight with sick assay,"
2686,PART THE FIRST,And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
2687,PART THE FIRST,"Then suddenly, as one defied,                                      260"
2688,PART THE FIRST,"Collects herself in scorn and pride,"

2692,PART THE FIRST,And with low voice and doleful look                                265
2693,PART THE FIRST,These words did say:
2694,PART THE FIRST,"""In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,"

2842,PART THE SECOND,"And pacing on through page and groom,                              395"
2843,PART THE SECOND,Enter the Baron's presence-room.
2844,PART THE SECOND,
2845,PART THE SECOND,"The Baron rose, and while he prest"
2846,PART THE SECOND,"His gentle daughter to his breast,"
2847,PART THE SECOND,With cheerful wonder in his eyes
2848,PART THE SECOND,"The lady Geraldine espies,                                         400"
2849,PART THE SECOND,"And gave such welcome to the same,"
2850,PART THE SECOND,As might beseem so bright a dame!
2851,PART THE SECOND,
2852,PART THE SECOND,"But when he heard the lady's tale,"
2853,PART THE SECOND,"And when she told her father's name,"
2854,PART THE SECOND,"Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale,                                     405"
2855,PART THE SECOND,"Murmuring o'er the name again,"
2856,PART THE SECOND,Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?
2857,PART THE SECOND,
2858,PART THE SECOND,Alas! they had been friends in youth;
2859,PART THE SECOND,But whispering tongues can poison truth;
2860,PART THE SECOND,And constancy lives in realms above;                               410
2861,PART THE SECOND,And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
2862,PART THE SECOND,And to be wroth with one we love
2863,PART THE SECOND,Doth work like madness in the brain.
2864,PART THE SECOND,"And thus it chanced, as I divine,"
2865,PART THE SECOND,With Roland and Sir Leoline.                                       415
2866,PART THE SECOND,Each spake words of high disdain
2867,PART THE SECOND,And insult to his heart's best brother:
2868,PART THE SECOND,They parted--ne'er to meet again!
2869,PART THE SECOND,But never either found another
2870,PART THE SECOND,To free the hollow heart from paining--                            420
2871,PART THE SECOND,"They stood aloof, the scars remaining,"
2872,PART THE SECOND,Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
2873,PART THE SECOND,A dreary sea now flows between.
2874,PART THE SECOND,"But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,"
2875,PART THE SECOND,"Shall wholly do away, I ween,                                      425"
2876,PART THE SECOND,The marks of that which once hath been.
2877,PART THE SECOND,
2878,PART THE SECOND,"Sir Leoline, a moment's space,"
2879,PART THE SECOND,Stood gazing on the damsel's face:
2880,PART THE SECOND,And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine
2881,PART THE SECOND,Came back upon his heart again.                                    430
2882,PART THE SECOND,
2883,PART THE SECOND,"O then the Baron forgot his age,"
2884,PART THE SECOND,His noble heart swelled high with rage;
2885,PART THE SECOND,He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side
2886,PART THE SECOND,"He would proclaim it far and wide,"
2887,PART THE SECOND,"With trump and solemn heraldry,                                    435"
2888,PART THE SECOND,"That they, who thus had wronged the dame"
2889,PART THE SECOND,Were base as spotted infamy!
2890,PART THE SECOND,"""And if they dare deny the same,"
2891,PART THE SECOND,"My herald shall appoint a week,"
2892,PART THE SECOND,And let the recreant traitors seek                                 440
2893,PART THE SECOND,My tourney court--that there and then
2894,PART THE SECOND,I may dislodge their reptile souls
2895,PART THE SECOND,"From the bodies and forms of men!"""
2896,PART THE SECOND,He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!
2897,PART THE SECOND,For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned                  445
2898,PART THE SECOND,In the beautiful lady the child of his friend!
2899,PART THE SECOND,
2900,PART THE SECOND,"And now the tears were on his face,"
2901,PART THE SECOND,And fondly in his arms he took
2902,PART THE SECOND,"Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace,"
2903,PART THE SECOND,Prolonging it with joyous look.                                    450
2904,PART THE SECOND,"Which when she viewed, a vision fell"
2905,PART THE SECOND,"Upon the soul of Christabel,"
2906,PART THE SECOND,"The vision of fear, the touch and pain!"
2907,PART THE SECOND,"She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again--"
2908,PART THE SECOND,"(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,                                   455"
2909,PART THE SECOND,Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)
2910,PART THE SECOND,
2911,PART THE SECOND,"Again she saw that bosom old,"
2912,PART THE SECOND,"Again she felt that bosom cold,"
2913,PART THE SECOND,And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:
2914,PART THE SECOND,"Whereat the Knight turned wildly round,                            460"
2915,PART THE SECOND,"And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid"
2916,PART THE SECOND,"With eyes upraised, as one that prayed."
2917,PART THE SECOND,
2918,PART THE SECOND,"The touch, the sight, had passed away,"
2919,PART THE SECOND,"And in its stead that vision blest,"
2920,PART THE SECOND,"Which comforted her after-rest,                                    465"
2921,PART THE SECOND,"While in the lady's arms she lay,"
2922,PART THE SECOND,"Had put a rapture in her breast,"
2923,PART THE SECOND,And on her lips and o'er her eyes
2924,PART THE SECOND,Spread smiles like light!
2925,PART THE SECOND,"With new surprise,"
2926,PART THE SECOND,"""What ails then my beloved child?""                                 470"
2927,PART THE SECOND,The Baron said--His daughter mild
2928,PART THE SECOND,"Made answer, ""All will yet be well!"""
2929,PART THE SECOND,"I ween, she had no power to tell"
2930,PART THE SECOND,Aught else: so mighty was the spell.
2931,PART THE SECOND,
2932,PART THE SECOND,"Yet he, who saw this Geraldine,                                    475"
2933,PART THE SECOND,Had deemed her sure a thing divine.
2934,PART THE SECOND,"Such sorrow with such grace she blended,"
2935,PART THE SECOND,As if she feared she had offended
2936,PART THE SECOND,"Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!"
2937,PART THE SECOND,And with such lowly tones she prayed                               480
2938,PART THE SECOND,She might be sent without delay
2939,PART THE SECOND,Home to her father's mansion.
2940,PART THE SECOND,"""Nay!"
2941,PART THE SECOND,"Nay, by my soul!"" said Leoline."
2942,PART THE SECOND,"""Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!"
2943,PART THE SECOND,"Go thou, with music sweet and loud,                                485"
2944,PART THE SECOND,"And take two steeds with trappings proud,"
2945,PART THE SECOND,And take the youth whom thou lov'st best
2946,PART THE SECOND,"To bear thy harp, and learn thy song,"
2947,PART THE SECOND,"And clothe you both in solemn vest,"
2948,PART THE SECOND,"And over the mountains haste along,                                490"
2949,PART THE SECOND,"Lest wandering folk, that are abroad,"
2950,PART THE SECOND,Detain you on the valley road.
2951,PART THE SECOND,
2952,PART THE SECOND,"""And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,"
2953,PART THE SECOND,"My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes"
2954,PART THE SECOND,"Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,                           495"
2955,PART THE SECOND,And reaches soon that castle good
2956,PART THE SECOND,Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.
2957,PART THE SECOND,
2958,PART THE SECOND,"""Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,"
2959,PART THE SECOND,"Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,"
2960,PART THE SECOND,More loud than your horses' echoing feet!                          500
2961,PART THE SECOND,"And loud and loud to Lord Roland call,"
2962,PART THE SECOND,'Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!
2963,PART THE SECOND,Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free--
2964,PART THE SECOND,Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me.
2965,PART THE SECOND,He bids thee come without delay                                    505
2966,PART THE SECOND,With all thy numerous array
2967,PART THE SECOND,And take thy lovely daughter home:
2968,PART THE SECOND,And he will meet thee on the way
2969,PART THE SECOND,With all his numerous array
2970,PART THE SECOND,White with their panting palfreys' foam':                          510
2971,PART THE SECOND,"And, by mine honour! I will say,"
2972,PART THE SECOND,That I repent me of the day
2973,PART THE SECOND,When I spake words of fierce disdain
2974,PART THE SECOND,To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!--
2975,PART THE SECOND,"--For since that evil hour hath flown,                             515"
2976,PART THE SECOND,Many a summer's sun hath shone;
2977,PART THE SECOND,Yet ne'er found I a friend again
2978,PART THE SECOND,"Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine."""
2979,PART THE SECOND,
2980,PART THE SECOND,"The lady fell, and clasped his knees,"
2981,PART THE SECOND,"Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;                           520"
2982,PART THE SECOND,"And Bracy replied, with faltering voice,"
2983,PART THE SECOND,His gracious hail on all bestowing;
2984,PART THE SECOND,"""Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,"
2985,PART THE SECOND,Are sweeter than my harp can tell;
2986,PART THE SECOND,"Yet might I gain a boon of thee,                                   525"
2987,PART THE SECOND,"This day my journey should not be,"
2988,PART THE SECOND,So strange a dream hath come to me;
2989,PART THE SECOND,That I had vowed with music loud
2990,PART THE SECOND,"To clear yon wood from thing unblest,"
2991,PART THE SECOND,Warned by a vision in my rest!                                     530
2992,PART THE SECOND,"For in my sleep I saw that dove,"
2993,PART THE SECOND,"That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,"
2994,PART THE SECOND,And call'st by thy own daughter's name--
2995,PART THE SECOND,"Sir Leoline! I saw the same,"
2996,PART THE SECOND,"Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,                             535"
2997,PART THE SECOND,Among the green herbs in the forest alone.
2998,PART THE SECOND,"Which when I saw and when I heard,"
2999,PART THE SECOND,I wondered what might ail the bird;
3000,PART THE SECOND,"For nothing near it could I see,"
3001,PART THE SECOND,Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.            540
3002,PART THE SECOND,
3003,PART THE SECOND,"""And in my dream, methought, I went"
3004,PART THE SECOND,To search out what might there be found;
3005,PART THE SECOND,"And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,"
3006,PART THE SECOND,That thus lay fluttering on the ground.
3007,PART THE SECOND,"I went and peered, and could descry                                545"
3008,PART THE SECOND,No cause for her distressful cry;
3009,PART THE SECOND,But yet for her dear lady's sake
3010,PART THE SECOND,"I stooped, methought, the dove to take,"
3011,PART THE SECOND,When lo! I saw a bright green snake
3012,PART THE SECOND,Coiled around its wings and neck.                                  550
3013,PART THE SECOND,"Green as the herbs on which it couched,"
3014,PART THE SECOND,Close by the dove's its head it crouched;
3015,PART THE SECOND,"And with the dove it heaves and stirs,"
3016,PART THE SECOND,Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!
3017,PART THE SECOND,"I woke; it was the midnight hour,                                  555"
3018,PART THE SECOND,The clock was echoing in the tower;
3019,PART THE SECOND,"But though my slumber was gone by,"
3020,PART THE SECOND,This dream it would not pass away--
3021,PART THE SECOND,It seems to live upon my eye!
3022,PART THE SECOND,And thence I vowed this self-same day                              560
3023,PART THE SECOND,With music strong and saintly song
3024,PART THE SECOND,"To wander through the forest bare,"
3025,PART THE SECOND,"Lest aught unholy loiter there."""
3026,PART THE SECOND,
3027,PART THE SECOND,"Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,"
3028,PART THE SECOND,Half-listening heard him with a smile;                             565
3029,PART THE SECOND,"Then turned to Lady Geraldine,"
3030,PART THE SECOND,His eyes made up of wonder and love;
3031,PART THE SECOND,"And said in courtly accents fine,"
3032,PART THE SECOND,"""Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,"
3033,PART THE SECOND,"With arms more strong than harp or song,                           570"
3034,PART THE SECOND,"Thy sire and I will crush the snake!"""
3035,PART THE SECOND,"He kissed her forehead as he spake,"
3036,PART THE SECOND,And Geraldine in maiden wise
3037,PART THE SECOND,"Casting down her large bright eyes,"
3038,PART THE SECOND,With blushing cheek and courtesy fine                              575
3039,PART THE SECOND,She turned her from Sir Leoline;
3040,PART THE SECOND,"Softly gathering up her train,"
3041,PART THE SECOND,That o'er her right arm fell again;
3042,PART THE SECOND,"And folded her arms across her chest,"
3043,PART THE SECOND,"And couched her head upon her breast,                              580"
3044,PART THE SECOND,And looked askance at Christabel--
3045,PART THE SECOND,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
3046,PART THE SECOND,
3047,PART THE SECOND,"A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy,"
3048,PART THE SECOND,"And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,"
3049,PART THE SECOND,"Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,                                 585"
3050,PART THE SECOND,"And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,"
3051,PART THE SECOND,At Christabel she looked askance!--
3052,PART THE SECOND,One moment--and the sight was fled!
3053,PART THE SECOND,But Christabel in dizzy trance
3054,PART THE SECOND,Stumbling on the unsteady ground                                   590
3055,PART THE SECOND,"Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;"
3056,PART THE SECOND,"And Geraldine again turned round,"
3057,PART THE SECOND,"And like a thing, that sought relief,"
3058,PART THE SECOND,"Full of wonder and full of grief,"
3059,PART THE SECOND,She rolled her large bright eyes divine                            595
3060,PART THE SECOND,Wildly on Sir Leoline.
3061,PART THE SECOND,
3062,PART THE SECOND,"The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,"
3063,PART THE SECOND,She nothing sees--no sight but one!
3064,PART THE SECOND,"The maid, devoid of guile and sin,"
3065,PART THE SECOND,"I know not how, in fearful wise,                                   600"
3066,PART THE SECOND,So deeply had she drunken in
3067,PART THE SECOND,"That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,"
3068,PART THE SECOND,That all her features were resigned
3069,PART THE SECOND,To this sole image in her mind:
3070,PART THE SECOND,And passively did imitate                                          605
3071,PART THE SECOND,That look of dull and treacherous hate!
3072,PART THE SECOND,"And thus she stood, in dizzy trance,"
3073,PART THE SECOND,Still picturing that look askance
3074,PART THE SECOND,With forced unconscious sympathy
3075,PART THE SECOND,Full before her father's view--                                    610
3076,PART THE SECOND,As far as such a look could be
3077,PART THE SECOND,In eyes so innocent and blue!
3078,PART THE SECOND,
3079,PART THE SECOND,"And when the trance was o'er, the maid"
3080,PART THE SECOND,"Paused awhile, and inly prayed:"
3081,PART THE SECOND,"Then falling at the Baron's feet,                                  615"
3082,PART THE SECOND,"""By my mother's soul, do I entreat"
3083,PART THE SECOND,"That thou this woman send away!"""
3084,PART THE SECOND,She said: and more she could not say:
3085,PART THE SECOND,"For what she knew she could not tell,"
3086,PART THE SECOND,O'er-mastered by the mighty spell.                                 620
3087,PART THE SECOND,
3088,PART THE SECOND,"Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,"
3089,PART THE SECOND,Sir Leoline? Thy only child
3090,PART THE SECOND,"Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,"
3091,PART THE SECOND,"So fair, so innocent, so mild;"
3092,PART THE SECOND,"The same, for whom thy lady died!                                  625"
3093,PART THE SECOND,"O, by the pangs of her dear mother"
3094,PART THE SECOND,Think thou no evil of thy child!
3095,PART THE SECOND,"For her, and thee, and for no other,"
3096,PART THE SECOND,She prayed the moment ere she died:
3097,PART THE SECOND,"Prayed that the babe for whom she died,                            630"
3098,PART THE SECOND,Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!
3099,PART THE SECOND,"That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,"
3100,PART THE SECOND,Sir Leoline!
3101,PART THE SECOND,"And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,"
3102,PART THE SECOND,Her child and thine?                                           635
3103,PART THE SECOND,
3104,PART THE SECOND,Within the Baron's heart and brain
3105,PART THE SECOND,"If thoughts, like these, had any share,"
3106,PART THE SECOND,"They only swelled his rage and pain,"
3107,PART THE SECOND,And did but work confusion there.
3108,PART THE SECOND,
3109,PART THE SECOND,"His heart was cleft with pain and rage,                            640"
3110,PART THE SECOND,"His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,"
3111,PART THE SECOND,Dishonoured thus in his old age;
3112,PART THE SECOND,"Dishonour'd by his only child,"
3113,PART THE SECOND,And all his hospitality
3114,PART THE SECOND,To the insulted daughter of his friend                             645
3115,PART THE SECOND,By more than woman's jealousy
3116,PART THE SECOND,Brought thus to a disgraceful end--
3117,PART THE SECOND,He rolled his eye with stern regard
3118,PART THE SECOND,"Upon the gentle minstrel bard,"
3119,PART THE SECOND,"And said in tones abrupt, austere--                                650"
3120,PART THE SECOND,"""Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?"
3121,PART THE SECOND,"I bade thee hence!"" The bard obeyed;"
3122,PART THE SECOND,"And turning from his own sweet maid,"
3123,PART THE SECOND,"The aged knight, Sir Leoline,"
3124,PART THE SECOND,Led forth the lady Geraldine!                                      655

3140,THE CONCLUSION TO PART THE SECOND,Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together
3141,THE CONCLUSION TO PART THE SECOND,Thoughts so all unlike each other;

3158,KUBLA KHAN,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
3159,KUBLA KHAN,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
3160,KUBLA KHAN,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
3161,KUBLA KHAN,Through caverns measureless to man
3162,KUBLA KHAN,Down to a sunless sea.                                             5
3163,KUBLA KHAN,So twice five miles of fertile ground
3164,KUBLA KHAN,With walls and towers were girdled round:
3165,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were gardens bright with sinuous rills,"
3166,KUBLA KHAN,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
3167,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,                         10"
3168,KUBLA KHAN,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
3169,KUBLA KHAN,
3170,KUBLA KHAN,But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
3171,KUBLA KHAN,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
3172,KUBLA KHAN,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
3173,KUBLA KHAN,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted                           15
3174,KUBLA KHAN,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
3175,KUBLA KHAN,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"
3176,KUBLA KHAN,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
3177,KUBLA KHAN,A mighty fountain momently was forced:
3178,KUBLA KHAN,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst                             20
3179,KUBLA KHAN,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
3180,KUBLA KHAN,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
3181,KUBLA KHAN,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
3182,KUBLA KHAN,It flung up momently the sacred river.
3183,KUBLA KHAN,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion                            25
3184,KUBLA KHAN,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
3185,KUBLA KHAN,"Then reached the caverns measureless to man,"
3186,KUBLA KHAN,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
3187,KUBLA KHAN,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
3188,KUBLA KHAN,Ancestral voices prophesying war!                                   30
3189,KUBLA KHAN,
3190,KUBLA KHAN,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
3191,KUBLA KHAN,Floated midway on the waves;
3192,KUBLA KHAN,Where was heard the mingled measure
3193,KUBLA KHAN,From the fountain and the caves.
3194,KUBLA KHAN,"It was a miracle of rare device,                                    35"
3195,KUBLA KHAN,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
3196,KUBLA KHAN,
3197,KUBLA KHAN,A damsel with a dulcimer
3198,KUBLA KHAN,In a vision once I saw:
3199,KUBLA KHAN,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"
3200,KUBLA KHAN,"And on her dulcimer she played,                                 40"
3201,KUBLA KHAN,Singing of Mount Abora.
3202,KUBLA KHAN,Could I revive within me.
3203,KUBLA KHAN,"Her symphony and song,"
3204,KUBLA KHAN,"To such a deep delight 'twould win me,"
3205,KUBLA KHAN,"That with music loud and long,                                      45"
3206,KUBLA KHAN,"I would build that dome in air,"
3207,KUBLA KHAN,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
3208,KUBLA KHAN,"And all who heard should see them there,"
3209,KUBLA KHAN,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
3210,KUBLA KHAN,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!                               50"
3211,KUBLA KHAN,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
3212,KUBLA KHAN,"And close your eyes with holy dread,"
3213,KUBLA KHAN,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
3214,KUBLA KHAN,And drunk the milk of Paradise.

3235,LOVE,
3236,LOVE,"She leant against the armed man,"
3237,LOVE,The statue of the armed knight;

3245,LOVE,
3246,LOVE,"I played a soft and doleful air,"
3247,LOVE,I sang an old and moving story--
3248,LOVE,"An old rude song, that suited well"
3249,LOVE,That ruin wild and hoary.
3250,LOVE,
3251,LOVE,"She listened with a flitting blush,                                 25"
3252,LOVE,With downcast eyes and modest grace;
3253,LOVE,"For well she knew, I could not choose"
3254,LOVE,But gaze upon her face.
3255,LOVE,
3256,LOVE,I told her of the Knight that wore
3257,LOVE,Upon his shield a burning brand;                                    30
3258,LOVE,And that for ten long years he wooed
3259,LOVE,The Lady of the Land.
3260,LOVE,
3261,LOVE,I told her how he pined: and ah!
3262,LOVE,"The deep, the low, the pleading tone"
3263,LOVE,"With which I sang another's love,                                   35"
3264,LOVE,Interpreted my own.
3265,LOVE,
3266,LOVE,"She listened with a flitting blush,"
3267,LOVE,"With downcast eyes, and modest grace"
3268,LOVE,"And she forgave me, that I gazed"
3269,LOVE,Too fondly on her face!                                           40
3270,LOVE,
3271,LOVE,But when I told the cruel scorn
3272,LOVE,"That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,"
3273,LOVE,"And that he crossed the mountain-woods,"
3274,LOVE,Nor rested day nor night;
3275,LOVE,
3276,LOVE,"That sometimes from the savage den,                                 45"
3277,LOVE,"And sometimes from the darksome shade,"
3278,LOVE,And sometimes starting up at once
3279,LOVE,"In green and sunny glade,--"
3280,LOVE,
3281,LOVE,There came and looked him in the face
3282,LOVE,An angel beautiful and bright;                                      50
3283,LOVE,"And that he knew it was a Fiend,"
3284,LOVE,This miserable Knight!
3285,LOVE,
3286,LOVE,"And that unknowing what he did,"
3287,LOVE,"He leaped amid a murderous band,"
3288,LOVE,And saved from outrage worse than death                             55
3289,LOVE,The Lady of the Land!
3290,LOVE,
3291,LOVE,"And how she wept, and clasped his knees;"
3292,LOVE,And how she tended him in vain--
3293,LOVE,And ever strove to expiate
3294,LOVE,The scorn that crazed his brain;--                                60
3295,LOVE,
3296,LOVE,And that she nursed him in a cave;
3297,LOVE,"And how his madness went away,"
3298,LOVE,When on the yellow forest-leaves
3299,LOVE,A dying man he lay;--
3300,LOVE,
3301,LOVE,His dying words--but when I reached                                 65
3302,LOVE,"That tenderest strain of all the ditty,"
3303,LOVE,My faltering voice and pausing harp
3304,LOVE,Disturbed her soul with pity!
3305,LOVE,
3306,LOVE,All impulses of soul and sense
3307,LOVE,Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve;                                70
3308,LOVE,"The music and the doleful tale,"
3309,LOVE,The rich and balmy eve;
3310,LOVE,
3311,LOVE,"And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,"
3312,LOVE,"An undistinguishable throng,"
3313,LOVE,"And gentle wishes long subdued,                                     75"
3314,LOVE,Subdued and cherished long!
3315,LOVE,
3316,LOVE,"She wept with pity and delight,"
3317,LOVE,"She blushed with love, and virgin-shame;"
3318,LOVE,"And like the murmur of a dream,"
3319,LOVE,I heard her breathe my name.                                      80
3320,LOVE,
3321,LOVE,"Her bosom heaved--she stepped aside,"
3322,LOVE,As conscious of my look she stepped--
3323,LOVE,"Then suddenly, with timorous eye"
3324,LOVE,She fled to me and wept.
3325,LOVE,
3326,LOVE,"She half enclosed me with her arms,                                 85"
3327,LOVE,She pressed me with a meek embrace;
3328,LOVE,"And bending back her head, looked up,"
3329,LOVE,And gazed upon my face.
3330,LOVE,
3331,LOVE,"'Twas partly love, and partly fear,"
3332,LOVE,"And partly 'twas a bashful art,                                     90"
3333,LOVE,"That I might rather feel, than see,"
3334,LOVE,The swelling of her heart.
3335,LOVE,
3336,LOVE,"I calmed her fears, and she was calm,"
3337,LOVE,And told her love with virgin pride;
3338,LOVE,"And so I won my Genevieve,                                          95"
3339,LOVE,My bright and beauteous Bride.

3846,THE ANCIENT MARINER,Dict. gives no examples of its use as a nautical term. Probably
3847,THE ANCIENT MARINER,Coleridge used it to give a suggestion of ante-Reformation times. The

3908,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"is often a mere exclamation of wonder and surprise, and so Coleridge"
3909,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"uses it here,--*grin*. Coleridge says (""Table Talk"" May 31, 1830): ""I"
3910,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"took the thought of 'grinning for joy' from my companion's remark to me,"
3911,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"when we had climbed to the top of Plinlimmon [in Wales, in the summer of"

3914,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"me: 'You grinned like an idiot.' He had done the same."" To ""grin"" was"
3915,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"originally to snarl and show the teeth as animals do when angry. ""They"

3921,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"companions, their muscles stiffened by drought, could show their"

3930,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"Second Day). It is seen in storms, driving by with all sails set, and is"
3931,THE ANCIENT MARINER,generally held to be an omen of disaster. Coleridge has shaped the
3932,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"legend to his own purposes. The ship appears in a calm, not in a storm,"
3933,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"and sailing without, rather than against, wind and tide; and instead of"
3934,THE ANCIENT MARINER,a crew of dead men it carries only Death and Life-in-Death. Possibly he
3935,THE ANCIENT MARINER,was acquainted with a form of the legend found in Bechstein's _Deutsches
3936,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"Sagenbuch_ (pointed out by Dr. Sykes), in which ""Falkenberg, for murder"

4005,THE ANCIENT MARINER,fevered pulse. The poem is full of this quality.
4006,THE ANCIENT MARINER,
4007,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"13, 297--*silly*. This word meant in Old English timely (from _soel_,"
4008,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"time, occasion) hence fortunate, blessed. From this was developed, under"
4009,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"the influence of medieval religious teaching, the meaning innocent,"
4010,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"harmless, simple; and from this again our modern meaning, foolish,"
4011,THE ANCIENT MARINER,simple in a derogatory sense. Chaucer has the word in all these
4012,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"meanings, and also in another, a modification of the second--wretched,"
4013,THE ANCIENT MARINER,"pitiable. Another shade of the same meaning appears in Spenser's ""silly"

4177,KUBLA KHAN,"Kubla Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, was a Mongolian conqueror who"
4178,KUBLA KHAN,stretched his empire from European Russia to the eastern shores of China
4179,KUBLA KHAN,"in the thirteenth century. His exploits, like those of his grandfather"
4180,KUBLA KHAN,"and those of the Mohammedan Timur in the next century, made a deep"
4181,KUBLA KHAN,impression on the imagination of Western Europe. Compilers of
4182,KUBLA KHAN,"travellers's tales, like Hakluyt and Purchas, caught up eagerly whatever"
4183,KUBLA KHAN,"they could find, history or legend, concerning the extent of his domain,"
4184,KUBLA KHAN,"the methods of his government, or the splendors of his court. The"
4185,KUBLA KHAN,"passage in ""Purchas his Pilgrimage"" to which Coleridge refers is as"

4188,KUBLA KHAN,"""In Xamdu did Cublai Can build a stately Palace, encompassing sixteene"

4196,KUBLA KHAN,"""It reads like an arras of reminiscences from several accounts of"

4202,KUBLA KHAN,"when Adam and Eve were driven from its gates, has exercised the"
4203,KUBLA KHAN,imagination of the Christian world from the early Middle Ages.
4204,KUBLA KHAN,Lactantius described it in the fourth century; the author of the
4205,KUBLA KHAN,"""Phoenix,"" probably in the eighth century, translated Lactantius' Latin"
4206,KUBLA KHAN,"into Anglo-Saxon verse; Sir John Mandeville, in the fourteenth century,"
4207,KUBLA KHAN,"though he did not reach it himself because he ""was not worthy,"" gives an"
4208,KUBLA KHAN,"account of it from what he has ""heard say of wise Men beyond;"" Milton"
4209,KUBLA KHAN,"described it enchantingly in ""Paradise Lost;"" Dr. Johnson used a"
4210,KUBLA KHAN,"modification of it in ""Rasselas;"" and William Morris in our own time"
4211,KUBLA KHAN,made it the framework for a delightful series of world-old tales. The
4212,KUBLA KHAN,"idea, indeed, is not peculiar to Christianity, but is probably to be"
4213,KUBLA KHAN,found in every civilization. Christian Europe has naturally located it
4214,KUBLA KHAN,"in the East; and since the Crusades, which brought Western Europe more"
4215,KUBLA KHAN,"in contact with the East, various eastern legends have been attached to"
4216,KUBLA KHAN,or confounded with the original notion. One of these is the Abyssinian
4217,KUBLA KHAN,"legend of the hill Amara (cf. l. 41, where Coleridge's ""Mount Abora"""
4218,KUBLA KHAN,seems to stand for Purchas's Amara). Amara in Purchas's account is a
4219,KUBLA KHAN,"hill in a great plain in Ethiopia, used as a prison for the sons of"
4220,KUBLA KHAN,"Abyssinian kings. Its level top, twenty leagues in circuit and"
4221,KUBLA KHAN,"surrounded by a high wall, is a garden of delight. ""Heauen and Earth,"
4222,KUBLA KHAN,"Nature and Industrie, have all been corriuals to it, all presenting"

4227,KUBLA KHAN,"Rocke, not with staires, but ascending little by little,"" and closed"
4228,KUBLA KHAN,"above and below with gates guarded by soldiers. ""Toward the South"" of"

4243,KUBLA KHAN,Mr. E.H. Coleridge (the poet's grandson) has recently shown that in the

4245,KUBLA KHAN,"through ... the Cherokee Country,"" by the American botanist William"
4246,KUBLA KHAN,Bartram. Chapter VII. of Bartram's book contains an account of some
4247,KUBLA KHAN,natural wonders in the Cherokee country that almost certainly afforded
4248,KUBLA KHAN,"part of the imagery of ""Kubla Khan."" Bartram, says Mr. Coleridge,"
4249,KUBLA KHAN,"""speaks of waters which 'descend by slow degrees through rocky caverns"
4250,KUBLA KHAN,"into the bowels of the earth, whence they are carried by subterraneous"
4251,KUBLA KHAN,channels into other receptacles and basons.' He travels for several
4252,KUBLA KHAN,miles over 'fertile eminences and delightful shady forests.' He is
4253,KUBLA KHAN,enchanted by a 'view of a dark sublime grove;' of the grand fountain he
4254,KUBLA KHAN,"says that the 'ebullition is astonishing and continual, though its"
4255,KUBLA KHAN,greatest force of fury intermits' (note the word 'intermits') 'regularly
4256,KUBLA KHAN,for the space of thirty seconds of time: the ebullition is perpendicular
4257,KUBLA KHAN,"upward, from a vast rugged orifice through a bed of rock throwing up"
4258,KUBLA KHAN,small particles of white shells.' He is informed by 'a trader' that when
4259,KUBLA KHAN,the Great Sink was forming there was heard 'an inexpressible rushing
4260,KUBLA KHAN,"noise like a mighty hurricane or thunderstorm,' that 'the earth was"
4261,KUBLA KHAN,"overflowed by torrents of water which came wave after wave rushing down,"
4262,KUBLA KHAN,"attended with a terrific noise and tremor of the earth,' that the"
4263,KUBLA KHAN,"fountain ceased to flow and 'sank into a huge bason of water;' but, as"
4264,KUBLA KHAN,"he saw with his own eyes, 'vast heaps of fragments of rock' (Coleridge"
4265,KUBLA KHAN,"writes 'huge fragments'), 'white chalk, stones, and pebbles had been"
4266,KUBLA KHAN,thrown up by the original outbursts and forced aside into the lateral
4267,KUBLA KHAN,"valleys.'"""
4268,KUBLA KHAN,
4269,KUBLA KHAN,From these and from other like sources Coleridge's mind was no doubt
4270,KUBLA KHAN,"stored with suggestions of tropical wonder and loveliness, which fell"
4271,KUBLA KHAN,together--if his own account of the making of the poem is to be relied
4272,KUBLA KHAN,"on--into the kaleidoscopic beauty of ""Kubla Khan."" It is not unlikely,"
4273,KUBLA KHAN,"too (cf. ll. 12-13), that the ash-tree dell at Stowey, which he had"
4274,KUBLA KHAN,"already used for a scene of supernatural terror in ""Osorio,"" bears some"
4275,KUBLA KHAN,part in his avowed dream of Xanadu.

4280,KUBLA KHAN,"16--*demon-lover.* The demon-lover (or more often, with sexes"
4281,KUBLA KHAN,"reversed, the fairy mistress) is a favorite theme of romance, taken from"
4282,KUBLA KHAN,"folk-lore, where it appears in many forms. Cf. the ballads of ""Thomas"
4283,KUBLA KHAN,"Rymer,"" ""Tam Lin,"" and ""The Demon Lover,"" in Child's ""English and"

4291,KUBLA KHAN,there by the aphis or plant-louse. It was supposed to be the food of
4292,KUBLA KHAN,"fairies. Not improbably Coleridge was thinking of manna, a saccharine"
4293,KUBLA KHAN,exudation found upon certain plants in the East. Mandeville describes it
4294,KUBLA KHAN,"as found in ""the Land of Job:"" ""This Manna is clept Bread of Angels. And"
4295,KUBLA KHAN,"it is a white Thing that is full sweet and right delicious, and more"

4301,KUBLA KHAN,"Professor Cooper, in the article cited in the introductory note above,"
4302,KUBLA KHAN,points out that this part of the poem contains perhaps reminiscences of
4303,KUBLA KHAN,the stories told of the Old Man of the Mountain. This was the title
4304,KUBLA KHAN,popularly given to the head of a fanatical sect of Mohammedans in Syria
4305,KUBLA KHAN,"in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, whose method of getting rid of"
4306,KUBLA KHAN,their enemies has given us the word _assassin_. To quote from
4307,KUBLA KHAN,"Mandeville's ""Travels,"" which has the essentials of the story, though"
