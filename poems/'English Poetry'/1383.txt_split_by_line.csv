418,VII,At night in a whirly dingle!

451,I,"A REVELATION came on Jane,"
452,I,The widow of a labouring swain:
453,I,"And first her body trembled sharp,"

461,II,
462,II,
463,II,"For past our hearing was the air,"
464,II,"Beyond our speaking what it bare,"

466,II,"Of heaven at work to cleanse outright,"
467,II,To make of her a mansion fit
468,II,For angel hosts inside to sit.

473,III,

475,III,"They entered, and forthwith entranced,"

485,IV,
486,IV,
487,IV,"These knew she had been reading books,"
488,IV,The which was witnessed by her looks
489,IV,Of late: she had a mania
490,IV,"For mad folk in America,"
491,IV,"And said for sure they led the way,"
492,IV,But meat and beer were meant to stay.

512,VI,Her arms and feet like those who hang:

514,VI,And neither pair contributed.
515,VI,She jumped in silence: she was thought

521,VII,

523,VII,The villagers were mostly dazed;

525,VII,"’Twas guessed by some she was inspired,"
526,VII,And some would have it she had hired
527,VII,"An engine in her petticoats,"

574,XI,"Then short like hobbled horses reared,"
575,XI,And down upon the grass they plumped:
576,XI,Alone their Jane to glory jumped.

593,XIII,

595,XIII,"When turnips were a filling crop,"
596,XIII,In scorn they jumped a butcher’s shop:
597,XIII,"Or, spite of threats to flog and souse,"
598,XIII,They jumped for shame a public-house:
599,XIII,And much their legs were seized with rage
600,XIII,If passing by the vicarage.

647,XVII,"And straight the legs, with just a knee"
648,XVII,For bending in a mild degree.

655,XVIII,The villagers might call them mad;
656,XVIII,"An endless holiday they had,"
657,XVIII,Of pleasure in a serious work:
658,XVIII,"They taught by leaps where perils lurk,"
659,XVIII,And with the lambkins practised sports

670,XIX,"Of light, our secret is to dance,"
671,XIX,And hold the tongue from hindering peace;
672,XIX,To dance out preacher and police.

681,XX,"With withies cut from hedge or copse,"
682,XX,"They treated them as whipping-tops,"
683,XX,And flung big stones with cruel aim;
684,XX,Yet all the flock jumped on the same.
685,XX,
686,XX,
687,XX,
688,XXI,XXI
689,XXI,

691,XXI,For what could persecution do
692,XXI,"To worry such a blessed crew,"
693,XXI,"On whom it was as wind to fire,"
694,XXI,Which set them always jumping higher?
695,XXI,"The parson and the lawyer tried,"

704,XXII,"As well, and this the Bishop too;"
705,XXII,When inner warnings proved him plain
706,XXII,The chase for Jump-to-glory Jane.
707,XXII,She knew it by his being sent
708,XXII,To bless the feasting in the tent.

711,XXII,
712,XXIII,XXIII
713,XXIII,

716,XXIII,The Squire had been the Bishop’s friend:
717,XXIII,"And his poor tenants, harmless ones,"
718,XXIII,"With souls to save! fed not on buns,"
719,XXIII,But angry meats: she took her place
720,XXIII,Outside to show the way to grace.

728,XXIV,The crowding people kindly viewed.
729,XXIV,A gaunt grey woman he saw rise
730,XXIV,"On air, with most beseeching eyes:"
731,XXIV,And evident as light in dark
732,XXIV,"It was, she set to him for mark."

735,XXIV,
736,XXV,XXV
737,XXV,
738,XXV,
739,XXV,Her highest leap had come: with ease
740,XXV,She jumped to reach the Bishop’s knees:
741,XXV,"Compressing tight her arms and lips,"
742,XXV,She sought to jump the Bishop’s hips:
743,XXV,"Her aim flew at his apron-band,"
744,XXV,That he might see and understand.

746,XXV,
747,XXV,
748,XXVI,XXVI
749,XXVI,
750,XXVI,
751,XXVI,The mild inquiry of his gaze
752,XXVI,"Was altered to a peaked amaze,"
753,XXVI,"At sight of thirty in ascent,"
754,XXVI,To gain his notice clearly bent:
755,XXVI,And greatly Jane at heart was vexed
756,XXVI,By his ploughed look of mind perplexed.
757,XXVI,
758,XXVI,
759,XXVI,
760,XXVII,XXVII
761,XXVII,
762,XXVII,
763,XXVII,"In jumps that said, Beware the pit!"
764,XXVII,More eloquent than speaking it—
765,XXVII,"That said, Avoid the boiled, the roast;"
766,XXVII,"The heated nose on face of ghost,"
767,XXVII,Which comes of drinking: up and o’er
768,XXVII,The flesh with me! did Jane implore.

772,XXVIII,XXVIII
773,XXVIII,
774,XXVIII,
775,XXVIII,She jumped him high as huntsmen go
776,XXVIII,"Across the gate; she jumped him low,"
777,XXVIII,To coax him to begin and feel
778,XXVIII,"His infant steps returning, peel"
779,XXVIII,"His mortal pride, exposing fruit,"
780,XXVIII,And off with hat and apron suit.

788,XXIX,"And out and out, and through and through,"
789,XXIX,"When we would gentlefolk address,"
790,XXIX,However we may seek to bless:
791,XXIX,At times they hide them like the beasts
792,XXIX,From sacred beams; and mostly priests.

800,XXX,Nor she of faintness or despair.
801,XXX,"Inflamed with hope that she might win,"
802,XXX,"If she but coaxed him to begin,"
803,XXX,She used all arts for making fain;
804,XXX,The mother with her babe was Jane.

814,XXXI,"The head of Jane, like flickering light,"
815,XXXI,"As in a charger, they beheld"
816,XXXI,Ere she was from the park expelled.

820,XXXII,XXXII
821,XXXII,
822,XXXII,
823,XXXII,"Her grief, in jumps of earthly weight,"

825,XXXII,For that the moment when began
826,XXXII,"The holy but mistaken man,"
827,XXXII,"In view of light, to take his lift,"
828,XXXII,They cut him from her charm adrift!

830,XXXII,
831,XXXII,
832,XXXIII,XXXIII
833,XXXIII,
834,XXXIII,
835,XXXIII,And he was lost: a banished face
836,XXXIII,"For ever from the ways of grace,"
837,XXXIII,Unless pinched hard by dreams in fright.
838,XXXIII,They saw the Bishop’s wavering sprite
839,XXXIII,"Within her look, at come and go,"
840,XXXIII,Long after he had caused her woe.
841,XXXIII,
842,XXXIII,
843,XXXIII,
844,XXXIV,XXXIV
845,XXXIV,
846,XXXIV,
847,XXXIV,Her greying eyes (until she sank
848,XXXIV,"At Fredsham on the wayside bank,"
849,XXXIV,Like cinder heaps that whitened lie
850,XXXIV,From coals that shot the flame to sky)
851,XXXIV,"Had glassy vacancies, which yearned"

862,XXXV,"At palaces and titled names,"
863,XXXV,Depart in such a cheerful strain
864,XXXV,As did our Jump-to-glory Jane!

866,XXXV,
867,XXXV,
868,XXXVI,XXXVI
869,XXXVI,
870,XXXVI,
871,XXXVI,Her end was beautiful: one sigh.
872,XXXVI,She jumped a foot when it was nigh.
873,XXXVI,A lily in a linen clout
874,XXXVI,She looked when they had laid her out.
875,XXXVI,It is a lily-light she bears
876,XXXVI,For England up the ladder-stairs.

932,I,He could have made the sovereign heights resound
933,I,With questions of the wherefore of her state:
934,I,He on far other but an hour before
935,I,"Intent.  And was it man, or was it mate,"
936,I,That she disdained? or was there haply more?
937,I,
938,I,About her mouth a placid humour slipped

981,II,Across his path the spouseless Lady cast
982,II,"Her shadow, and the man that thing became."
983,II,His youth uprising called his age the Past.
984,II,"This was the strong grey head of laurelled name,"
985,II,And in his bosom an inverted Sage
986,II,Mistook for light of morn the light which sank.
987,II,But who while veins run blood shall know the page
988,II,Succeeding ere we turn upon our blank?
989,II,"Comes Beauty with her tale of moon and cloud,"
990,II,Her silvered rims of mystery pointing in
991,II,"To hollows of the half-veiled unavowed,"
992,II,"Where beats her secret life, grey heads will spin"
993,II,"Quick as the young, and spell those hieroglyphs"
994,II,"Of phosphorescent dusk, devoutly bent;"
995,II,They drink a cup to whirl on dizzier cliffs
996,II,"For their shamed fall, which asks, why was she sent!"
997,II,"Why, and of whom, and whence; and tell they truth,"
998,II,The legends of her mission to beguile?
999,II,
1000,II,Hard likeness to the toilful apes of youth
1001,II,"He bore at times, and tempted the sly smile;"
1002,II,And not on her soft lips was it descried.
1003,II,She stepped her way benevolently grave:
1004,II,"Nor sign that Beauty fed her worm of pride,"
1005,II,"By tossing victim to the courtier knave,"
1006,II,"Let peep, nor of the naughty pride gave sign."
1007,II,"Rather ’twas humbleness in being pursued,"
1008,II,As pilgrim to the temple of a shrine.
1009,II,Had he not wits to pierce the mask he wooed?
1010,II,All wisdom’s armoury this man could wield;
1011,II,And if the cynic in the Sage it pleased
1012,II,"Traverse her woman’s curtain and poor shield,"
1013,II,For new example of a world diseased;
1014,II,"Showing her shrineless, not a temple, bare;"
1015,II,A curtain ripped to tatters by the blast;
1016,II,Yet she most surely to this man stood fair:
1017,II,"He worshipped like the young enthusiast,"
1018,II,Named simpleton or poet.  Did he read
1019,II,"Right through, and with the voice she held reserved"
1020,II,Amid her vacant ruins jointly plead?
1021,II,
1022,II,Compassion for the man thus noble nerved
1023,II,"The pity for herself she felt in him,"
1024,II,"To wreak a deed of sacrifice, and save;"
1025,II,"At least, be worthy.  That our soul may swim,"
1026,II,We sink our heart down bubbling under wave.
1027,II,It bubbles till it drops among the wrecks.
1028,II,"But, ah! confession of a woman’s breast:"
1029,II,"She eminent, she honoured of her sex!"
1030,II,"Truth speaks, and takes the spots of the confessed,"
1031,II,"To veil them.  None of women, save their vile,"
1032,II,Plays traitor to an army in the field.
1033,II,The cries most vindicating most defile.
1034,II,"How shall a cause to Nature be appealed,"
1035,II,"When, under pressure of their common foe,"
1036,II,"Her sisters shun the Mother and disown,"
1037,II,On pain of his intolerable crow
1038,II,"Above the fiction, built for him, o’erthrown?"
1039,II,"Irrational he is, irrational"
1040,II,"Must they be, though not Reason’s light shall wane"
1041,II,"In them with ever Nature at close call,"
1042,II,Behind the fiction torturing to sustain;
1043,II,"Who hear her in the milk, and sometimes make"
1044,II,"A tongueless answer, shivered on a sigh:"
1045,II,Whereat men dread their lofty structure’s quake
1046,II,"Once more, and in their hosts for tocsin ply"
1047,II,"The crazy roar of peril, leonine"
1048,II,For injured majesty.  That sigh of dames
1049,II,Is rare and soon suppressed.  Not they combine
1050,II,"To shake the structure sheltering them, which tames"
1051,II,"Their lustier if not wilder: fixed are they,"
1052,II,In elegancy scarce denoting ease;
1053,II,"And do they breathe, it is not to betray"
1054,II,The martyr in the caryatides.
1055,II,Yet here and there along the graceful row
1056,II,"Is one who fetches breath from deeps, who deems,"
1057,II,"Moved by a desperate craving, their old foe"
1058,II,"May yield a trustier friend than woman seems,"
1059,II,And aid to bear the sculptured floral weight
1060,II,Massed upon heads not utterly of stone:
1061,II,May stamp endurance by expounding fate.
1062,II,"She turned to him, and, This you seek is gone;"
1063,II,"Look in, she said, as pants the furnace, brief,"
1064,II,Frost-white.  She gave his hearing sight to view
1065,II,The silent chamber of a brown curled leaf:
1066,II,Thing that had throbbed ere shot black lightning through.
1067,II,No further sign of heart could he discern:
1068,II,The picture of her speech was winter sky;
1069,II,"A headless figure folding a cleft urn,"
1070,II,Where tears once at the overflow were dry.
1071,II,
1072,II,
1073,II,
1074,III,III
1075,III,
1076,III,
1077,III,So spake she her first utterance on the rack.
1078,III,"It softened torment, in the funeral hues"
1079,III,"Round wan Romance at ebb, but drove her back"
1080,III,"To listen to herself, herself accuse"
1081,III,Harshly as Love’s imperial cause allowed.
1082,III,"She meant to grovel, and her lover praised"
1083,III,"So high o’er the condemnatory crowd,"
1084,III,That she perforce a fellow phoenix blazed.
1085,III,
1086,III,"The picture was of hand fast joined to hand,"
1087,III,"Both pushed from angry skies, their grasp more pledged"
1088,III,Under the threatened flash of a bright brand
1089,III,"At arm’s length up, for severing action edged."
1090,III,"Why, then Love’s Court of Honour contemplate;"
1091,III,"And two drowned shorecasts, who, for the life esteemed"
1092,III,"Above their lost, invoke an advocate"
1093,III,"In Passion’s purity, thereby redeemed."
1094,III,
1095,III,"Redeemed, uplifted, glimmering on a throne,"
1096,III,The woman stricken by an arrow falls.
1097,III,"His advocate she can be, not her own,"
1098,III,"If, Traitress to thy sex! one sister calls."
1099,III,Have we such scenes of drapery’s mournfulness
1100,III,"On Beauty’s revelations, witched we plant,"
1101,III,"Over the fair shape humbled to confess,"
1102,III,"An angel’s buckler, with loud choiric chant."
1103,III,
1104,III,
1105,III,
1106,IV,IV
1107,IV,
1108,IV,
1109,IV,"No knightly sword to serve, nor harp of bard,"
1110,IV,The lady’s hand in her physician’s knew.
1111,IV,"She had not hoped for them as her award,"
1112,IV,When zig-zag on the tongue electric flew
1113,IV,"Her charge of counter-motives, none impure:"
1114,IV,"But muteness whipped her skin.  She could have said,"
1115,IV,"Her free confession was to work his cure,"
1116,IV,Show proofs for why she could not love or wed.
1117,IV,Were they not shown?  His muteness shook in thrall
1118,IV,Her body on the verge of that black pit
1119,IV,"Sheer from the treacherous confessional,"
1120,IV,"Demanding further, while perusing it."
1121,IV,
1122,IV,Slave is the open mouth beneath the closed.
1123,IV,She sank; she snatched at colours; they were peel
1124,IV,"Of fruit past savour, in derision rosed."
1125,IV,For the dark downward then her soul did reel.
1126,IV,A press of hideous impulse urged to speak:
1127,IV,A novel dread of man enchained her dumb.
1128,IV,"She felt the silence thicken, heard it shriek,"
1129,IV,Heard Life subsiding on the eternal hum:
1130,IV,"Welcome to women, when, between man’s laws"
1131,IV,"And Nature’s thirsts, they, soul from body torn,"
1132,IV,"Give suck at breast to a celestial cause,"
1133,IV,"Named by the mouth infernal, and forsworn."
1134,IV,"Nathless her forehead twitched a sad content,"
1135,IV,"To think the cure so manifest, so frail"
1136,IV,Her charm remaining.  Was the curtain’s rent
1137,IV,Too wide? he but a man of that herd male?
1138,IV,She saw him as that herd of the forked head
1139,IV,"Butting the woman harrowed on her knees,"
1140,IV,Clothed only in life’s last devouring red.
1141,IV,Confession at her fearful instant sees
1142,IV,Judicial Silence write the devil fact
1143,IV,"In letters of the skeleton: at once,"
1144,IV,"Swayed on the supplication of her act,"
1145,IV,"The rabble reading, roaring to denounce,"
1146,IV,"She joins.  No longer colouring, with skips"
1147,IV,"At tangles, picture that for eyes in tears"
1148,IV,"Might swim the sequence, she addressed her lips"
1149,IV,To do the scaffold’s office at his ears.
1150,IV,
1151,IV,Into the bitter judgement of that herd
1152,IV,"On women, she, deeming it present, fell."
1153,IV,Her frenzy of abasement hugged the word
1154,IV,"They stone with, and so pile their citadel"
1155,IV,To launch at outcasts the foul levin bolt.
1156,IV,"As had he flung it, in her breast it burned."
1157,IV,Face and reflect it did her hot revolt
1158,IV,"From hardness, to the writhing rebel turned;"
1159,IV,"Because the golden buckler was withheld,"
1160,IV,"She to herself applies the powder-spark,"
1161,IV,"For joy of one wild demon burst ere quelled,"
1162,IV,Perishing to astound the tyrant Dark.
1163,IV,
1164,IV,"She had the Scriptural word so scored on brain,"
1165,IV,"It rang through air to sky, and rocked a world"
1166,IV,That danced down shades the scarlet dance profane;
1167,IV,"Most women! see! by the man’s view dustward hurled,"
1168,IV,"Impenitent, submissive, torn in two."
1169,IV,"They sink upon their nature, the unnamed,"
1170,IV,"And sops of nourishment may get some few,"
1171,IV,"In place of understanding, scourged and shamed."
1172,IV,
1173,IV,Barely have seasoned women understood
1174,IV,"The great Irrational, who thunders power,"
1175,IV,"Drives Nature to her primitive wild wood,"
1176,IV,And courts her in the covert’s dewy hour;
1177,IV,"Returning to his fortress nigh night’s end,"
1178,IV,With execration of her daughters’ lures.
1179,IV,"They help him the proud fortress to defend,"
1180,IV,"Nor see what front it wears, what life immures,"
1181,IV,The murder it commits; nor that its base
1182,IV,Is shifty as a huckster’s opening deal
1183,IV,"For bargain under smoothest market face,"
1184,IV,"While Gentleness bids frigid Justice feel,"
1185,IV,Justice protests that Reason is her seat;
1186,IV,"Elect Convenience, as Reason masked,"
1187,IV,Hears calmly cramped Humanity entreat;
1188,IV,"Until a sentient world is overtasked,"
1189,IV,And rouses Reason’s fountain-self: she calls
1190,IV,On Nature; Nature answers: Share your guilt
1191,IV,In common when contention cracks the walls
1192,IV,Of the big house which not on me is built.
1193,IV,
1194,IV,The Lady said as much as breath will bear;
1195,IV,To happier sisters inconceivable:
1196,IV,"Contemptible to veterans of the fair,"
1197,IV,"Who show for a convolving pearly shell,"
1198,IV,"A treasure of the shore, their written book."
1199,IV,As much as woman’s breath will bear and live
1200,IV,"Shaped she to words beneath a knotted look,"
1201,IV,That held as if for grain the summing sieve.
1202,IV,"Her judge now brightened without pause, as wakes"
1203,IV,Our homely daylight after dread of spells.
1204,IV,Lips sugared to let loose the little snakes
1205,IV,Of slimy lustres ringing elfin bells
1206,IV,"About a story of the naked flesh,"
1207,IV,"Intending but to put some garment on,"
1208,IV,"Should learn, that in the subject they enmesh,"
1209,IV,A traitor lurks and will be known anon.
1210,IV,"Delusion heating pricks the torpid doubt,"
1211,IV,Stationed for index down an ancient track:
1212,IV,And ware of it was he while she poured out
1213,IV,A broken moon on forest-waters black.
1214,IV,
1215,IV,Though past the stage where midway men are skilled
1216,IV,"To scan their senses wriggling under plough,"
1217,IV,"When yet to the charmed seed of speech distilled,"
1218,IV,"Their hearts are fallow, he, and witless how,"
1219,IV,"Loathing, had yielded, like bruised limb to leech,"
1220,IV,Not handsomely; but now beholding bleed
1221,IV,"Soul of the woman in her prostrate speech,"
1222,IV,The valour of that rawness he could read.
1223,IV,"Thence flashed it, as the crimson currents ran"
1224,IV,"From senses up to thoughts, how she had read"
1225,IV,Maternally the warm remainder man
1226,IV,"Beneath his crust, and Nature’s pity shed,"
1227,IV,In shedding dearer than heart’s blood to light
1228,IV,His vision of the path mild Wisdom walks.
1229,IV,Therewith he could espy Confession’s fright;
1230,IV,Her need of him: these flowers grow on stalks;
1231,IV,"They suck from soil, and have their urgencies"
1232,IV,Beside and with the lovely face mid leaves.
1233,IV,"Veins of divergencies, convergencies,"
1234,IV,Our botanist in womankind perceives;
1235,IV,"And if he hugs no wound, the man can prize"
1236,IV,That splendid consummation and sure proof
1237,IV,"Of more than heart in her, who might despise,"
1238,IV,"Who drowns herself, for pity up aloof"
1239,IV,To soar and be like Nature’s pity: she
1240,IV,Instinctive of what virtue in young days
1241,IV,"Had served him for his pilot-star on sea,"
1242,IV,To trouble him in haven.  Thus his gaze
1243,IV,"Came out of rust, and more than the schooled tongue"
1244,IV,Was gifted to encourage and assure.
1245,IV,He gave her of the deep well she had sprung;
1246,IV,"And name it gratitude, the word is poor."
1247,IV,"But name it gratitude, is aught as rare"
1248,IV,From sex to sex?  And let it have survived
1249,IV,"Their conflict, comes the peace between the pair,"
1250,IV,Unknown to thousands husbanded and wived:
1251,IV,"Unknown to Passion, generous for prey:"
1252,IV,"Unknown to Love, too blissful in a truce."
1253,IV,Their tenderest of self did each one slay;
1254,IV,"His cloak of dignity, her fleur de luce;"
1255,IV,"Her lily flower, and his abolla cloak,"
1256,IV,"Things living, slew they, and no artery bled."
1257,IV,A moment of some sacrificial smoke
1258,IV,"They passed, and were the dearer for their dead."
1259,IV,
1260,IV,He learnt how much we gain who make no claims.
1261,IV,A nightcap on his flicker of grey fire
1262,IV,"Was thought of her sharp shudder in the flames,"
1263,IV,"Confessing; and its conjured image dire,"
1264,IV,"Of love, the torrent on the valley dashed;"
1265,IV,"The whirlwind swathing tremulous peaks; young force,"
1266,IV,Visioned to hold corrected and abashed
1267,IV,Our senile emulous; which rolls its course
1268,IV,Proud to the shattering end; with these few last
1269,IV,"Hot quintessential drops of bryony juice,"
1270,IV,Squeezed out in anguish: all of that once vast!
1271,IV,"And still, though having skin for man’s abuse,"
1272,IV,Though no more glorying in the beauteous wreath
1273,IV,"Shot skyward from a blood at passionate jet,"
1274,IV,"Repenting but in words, that stand as teeth"
1275,IV,Between the vivid lips; a vassal set;
1276,IV,"And numb, of formal value.  Are we true"
1277,IV,"In nature, never natural thing repents;"
1278,IV,"Albeit receiving punishment for due,"
1279,IV,Among the group of this world’s penitents;
1280,IV,"Albeit remorsefully regretting, oft"
1281,IV,"Cravenly, while the scourge no shudder spares."
1282,IV,
1283,IV,Our world believes it stabler if the soft
1284,IV,Are whipped to show the face repentance wears.
1285,IV,"Then hear it, in a moan of atheist gloom,"
1286,IV,Deplore the weedy growth of hypocrites;
1287,IV,"Count Nature devilish, and accept for doom"
1288,IV,The chasm between our passions and our wits!
1289,IV,
1290,IV,"Affecting lunar whiteness, patent snows,"
1291,IV,It trembles at betrayal of a sore.
1292,IV,"Hers is the glacier-conscience, to expose"
1293,IV,Impurities for clearness at the core.
1294,IV,
1295,IV,"She to her hungered thundering in breast,"
1296,IV,"_Ye shall not starve_, not feebly designates"
1297,IV,"The world repressing as a life repressed,"
1298,IV,Judged by the wasted martyrs it creates.
1299,IV,"How Sin, amid the shades Cimmerian,"
1300,IV,"Repents, she points for sight: and she avers,"
1301,IV,The hoofed half-angel in the Puritan
1302,IV,Nigh reads her when no brutish wrath deters.
1303,IV,
1304,IV,"Sin against immaturity, the sin"
1305,IV,"Of ravenous excess, what deed divides"
1306,IV,Man from vitality; these bleed within;
1307,IV,Bleed in the crippled relic that abides.
1308,IV,"Perpetually they bleed; a limb is lost,"
1309,IV,"A piece of life, the very spirit maimed."
1310,IV,But culprit who the law of man has crossed
1311,IV,With Nature’s dubiously within is blamed;
1312,IV,"Despite our cry at cutting of the whip,"
1313,IV,"Our shiver in the night when numbers frown,"
1314,IV,"We but bewail a broken fellowship,"
1315,IV,"A sting, an isolation, a fall’n crown."
1316,IV,
1317,IV,"Abject of sinners is that sensitive,"
1318,IV,"The flesh, amenable to stripes, miscalled"
1319,IV,Incorrigible: such title do we give
1320,IV,To the poor shrinking stuff wherewith we are walled;
1321,IV,"And, taking it for Nature, place in ban"
1322,IV,"Our Mother, as a Power wanton-willed,"
1323,IV,"The shame and baffler of the soul of man,"
1324,IV,"The recreant, reptilious.  Do thou build"
1325,IV,Thy mind on her foundations in earth’s bed;
1326,IV,"Behold man’s mind the child of her keen rod,"
1327,IV,For teaching how the wits and passions wed
1328,IV,To rear that temple of the credible God;
1329,IV,"Sacred the letters of her laws, and plain,"
1330,IV,"Will shine, to guide thy feet and hold thee firm:"
1331,IV,"Then, as a pathway through a field of grain,"
1332,IV,"Man’s laws appear the blind progressive worm,"
1333,IV,"That moves by touch, and thrust of linking rings"
1334,IV,"The which to endow with vision, lift from mud"
1335,IV,"To level of their nature’s aims and springs,"
1336,IV,"Must those, the twain beside our vital flood,"
1337,IV,"Now on opposing banks, the twain at strife"
1338,IV,(Whom the so rosy ferryman invites
1339,IV,"To junction, and mid-channel over Life,"
1340,IV,"Unmasked to the ghostly, much asunder smites)"
1341,IV,"Instruct in deeper than Convenience,"
1342,IV,In higher than the harvest of a year.
1343,IV,Only the rooted knowledge to high sense
1344,IV,"Of heavenly can mount, and feel the spur"
1345,IV,"For fruitfullest advancement, eye a mark"
1346,IV,"Beyond the path with grain on either hand,"
1347,IV,Help to the steering of our social Ark
1348,IV,Over the barbarous waters unto land.
1349,IV,
1350,IV,"For us the double conscience and its war,"
1351,IV,"The serving of two masters, false to both,"
1352,IV,"Until those twain, who spring the root and are"
1353,IV,"The knowledge in division, plight a troth"
1354,IV,Of equal hands: nor longer circulate
1355,IV,"A pious token for their current coin,"
1356,IV,"To growl at the exchange; they, mate and mate,"
1357,IV,Fair feminine and masculine shall join
1358,IV,"Upon an upper plane, still common mould,"
1359,IV,Where stamped religion and reflective pace
1360,IV,"A statelier measure, and the hoop of gold"
1361,IV,Rounds to horizon for their soul’s embrace.
1362,IV,Then shall those noblest of the earth and sun
1363,IV,Inmix unlike to waves on savage sea.
1364,IV,"But not till Nature’s laws and man’s are one,"
1365,IV,Can marriage of the man and woman be.
1366,IV,
1367,IV,
1368,IV,
1369,V,V
1370,V,
1371,V,
1372,V,He passed her through the sermon’s dull defile.
1373,V,Down under billowy vapour-gorges heaved
1374,V,The city and the vale and mountain-pile.
1375,V,She felt strange push of shuttle-threads that weaved.
1376,V,
1377,V,A new land in an old beneath her lay;
1378,V,"And forth to meet it did her spirit rush,"
1379,V,"As bride who without shame has come to say,"
1380,V,"Husband, in his dear face that caused her blush."
1381,V,
1382,V,"A natural woman’s heart, not more than clad"
1383,V,"By station and bright raiment, gathers heat"
1384,V,From nakedness in trusted hands: she had
1385,V,"The joy of those who feel the world’s heart beat,"
1386,V,After long doubt of it as fire or ice;
1387,V,Because one man had helped her to breathe free;
1388,V,Surprised to faith in something of a price
1389,V,Past the old charity in chivalry:—
1390,V,Our first wild step to right the loaded scales
1391,V,Displaying women shamefully outweighed.
1392,V,The wisdom of humaneness best avails
1393,V,For serving justice till that fraud is brayed.
1394,V,Her buried body fed the life she drank.
1395,V,And not another stripping of her wound!
1396,V,"The startled thought on black delirium sank,"
1397,V,"While with her gentle surgeon she communed,"
1398,V,And woman’s prospect of the yoke repelled.
1399,V,Her buried body gave her flowers and food;
1400,V,"The peace, the homely skies, the springs that welled;"
1401,V,"Love, the large love that folds the multitude."
1402,V,"Soul’s chastity in honesty, and this"
1403,V,"With beauty, made the dower to men refused."
1404,V,And little do they know the prize they miss;
1405,V,Which is their happy fortune!  Thus he mused
1406,V,
1407,V,"For him, the cynic in the Sage had play"
1408,V,"A hazy moment, by a breath dispersed;"

1619,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Eye of the waters, and throb of the tree,"

1627,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Shone she a lure of the honey-bag swarm,"
1628,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Most was her beam on the knightly: she led
1629,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For the honours of manhood more than the prize;
1630,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Waved her magnetical yoke
1631,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Whither the warrior bled,"
1632,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Ere to the bower of sighs.
1633,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And shy of her secrets she was; under deeps

1644,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,A whirling seized thy head;
1645,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The vision of beauty was flecked.
1646,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Note well the how and the when,"
1647,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The thing that prompted and sped.
1648,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thereanon the keen passions clapped wing,"
1649,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Fixed eye, and the world was prey."
1650,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"No simple world of thy greenblade Spring,"

1744,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To those having nought to reflect it, ’tis nought;"
1745,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To those who are misty, ’tis mist on the beach"
1746,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,From the billow withdrawing; to those who see
1747,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Earth, our mother, in thought,"
1748,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Her spirit it is, our key."
1749,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1750,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Ay, the Life and the Death are her words to us here,"
1751,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Of one significance, pricking the blind."
1752,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,This is thy gain now the surface is clear:
1753,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,To read with a soul in the mirror of mind
1754,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Is man’s chief lesson.—Thou smilest!  I preach!
1755,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Acid smiling, my friend, reveals"
1756,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Abysses within; frigid preaching a street
1757,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Paved unconcernedly smooth
1758,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"For the lecturer straight on his heels,"
1759,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Up and down a policeman’s beat;
1760,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Bearing tonics not labelled to soothe.
1761,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Thou hast a disgust of the sermon in rhyme.
1762,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,It is not attractive in being too chaste.
1763,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The popular tale of adventure and crime
1764,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Would equally sicken an overdone taste.
1765,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"So, then, onward.  Philosophy, thoughtless to soothe,"
1766,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Lifts, if thou wilt, or there leaves thee supine."
1767,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1768,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thy condition, good sooth, has no seeming of sweet;"
1769,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"It walks our first crags, it is flint for the tooth,"
1770,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For the thirsts of our nature brine.
1771,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"But manful has met it, manful will meet."
1772,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And think of thy privilege: supple with youth,"
1773,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To have sight of the headlong swine,"
1774,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Once fouling thee, jumping the dips!"
1775,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,As the coin of thy purse poured out:
1776,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,An animal’s holiday past:
1777,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And free of them thou, to begin a new bout;"
1778,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,To start a fresh hunt on a resolute blast:
1779,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,No more an imp-ridden to bournes of eclipse:
1780,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Having knowledge to spur thee, a gift to compare;"
1781,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Rubbing shoulder to shoulder, as only the book"
1782,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Of the world can be read, by necessity urged."
1783,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"For witness, what blinkers are they who look"
1784,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,From the state of the prince or the millionnaire!
1785,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"They see but the fish they attract,"
1786,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The hungers on them converged;
1787,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And never the thought in the shell of the act,"
1788,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Nor ever life’s fangless mirth.
1789,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"But first, that the poisonous of thee be purged,"
1790,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Go into thyself, strike Earth."
1791,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"She is there, she is felt in a blow struck hard."
1792,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thou findest a pugilist countering quick,"
1793,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Cunning at drives where thy shutters are barred;
1794,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Not, after the studied professional trick,"
1795,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Blue-sealing; she brightens the sight.  Strike Earth,"
1796,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Antaeus, young giant, whom fortune trips!"
1797,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And thou com’st on a saving fact,"
1798,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,To nourish thy planted worth.
1799,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1800,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Be it clay, flint, mud, or the rubble of chips,"
1801,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Thy roots have grasp in the stern-exact:
1802,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The redemption of sinners deluded! the last
1803,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Dry handful, that bruises and saves."
1804,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To the common big heart are we bound right fast,"
1805,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,When our Mother admonishing nips
1806,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"At the nakedness bare of a clout,"
1807,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And we crave what the commonest craves.
1808,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1809,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"This wealth was a fortress-wall,"
1810,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Under which grew our grim little beast-god stout;
1811,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Self-worshipped, the foe, in division from all;"
1812,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"With crowds of illogical Christians, no doubt;"
1813,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Till the rescuing earthquake cracked.
1814,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Thus are we man made firm;
1815,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Made warm by the numbers compact.
1816,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"We follow no longer a trumpet-snout,"
1817,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"At a trot where the hog is tracked,"
1818,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Nor wriggle the way of the worm.
1819,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1820,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Thou wilt spare us the cynical pout
1821,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,At humanity: sign of a nature bechurled.
1822,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,No stenchy anathemas cast
1823,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Upon Providence, women, the world."
1824,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Distinguish thy tempers and trim thy wits.
1825,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"The purchased are things of the mart, not classed"
1826,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Among resonant types that have freely grown.
1827,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1828,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Thy knowledge of women might be surpassed:
1829,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,As any sad dog’s of sweet flesh when he quits
1830,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The wayside wandering bone!
1831,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,No revilings of comrades as ingrates: thee
1832,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"The tempter, misleader, and criminal (screened"
1833,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,By laws yet barbarous) own.
1834,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1835,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"If some one performed Fiend’s deputy,"
1836,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,He was for awhile the Fiend.
1837,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Still, nursing a passion to speak,"
1838,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"As the punch-bowl does, in the moral vein,"
1839,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"When the ladle has finished its leak,"
1840,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And the vessel is loquent of nature’s inane,"
1841,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Hie where the demagogues roar
1842,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Like a Phalaris bull, with the victim’s force:"
1843,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Hurrah to their jolly attack
1844,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,On a City that smokes of the Plain;
1845,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"A city of sin’s death-dyes,"
1846,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Holding revel of worms in a corse;
1847,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"A city of malady sore,"
1848,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Over-ripe for the big doom’s crack:
1849,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,A city of hymnical snore;
1850,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Connubial truths and lies
1851,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Demanding an instant divorce,"
1852,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Clean as the bright from the black.
1853,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,It were well for thy system to sermonize.
1854,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"There are giants to slay, and they call for their Jack."
1855,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1856,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Then up stand thou in the midst:
1857,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thy good grain out of thee thresh,"
1858,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Hand upon heart: relate
1859,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,What things thou legally didst
1860,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For the Archseducer of flesh.
1861,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Omitting the murmurs of women and fate,"
1862,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Confess thee an instrument armed
1863,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To be snare of our wanton, our weak,"
1864,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Of all by the sensual charmed.
1865,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For once shall repentance be done by the tongue:
1866,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Speak, though execrate, speak"
1867,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,A word on grandmotherly Laws
1868,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Giving rivers of gold to our young,"
1869,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,In the days of their hungers impure;
1870,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To furnish them beak and claws,"
1871,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And make them a banquet’s lure.
1872,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1873,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thou the example, saved"
1874,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Miraculously by this poor skin!
1875,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Thereat let the Purse be waved:
1876,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The snake-slough sick of the snaky sin:
1877,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"A devil, if devil as devil behaved"
1878,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Ever, thou knowest, look thou but in,"
1879,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Where he shivers, a culprit fettered and shaved;"
1880,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"O a bird stripped of feather, a fish clipped of fin!"
1881,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1882,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And commend for a washing the torrents of wrath,"
1883,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Which hurl at the foe of the dearest men prize
1884,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Rough-rolling boulders and froth.
1885,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Gigantical enginery they can command,"
1886,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For the crushing of enemies not of great size:
1887,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,But hold to thy desperate stand.
1888,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Men’s right of bequeathing their all to their own
1889,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,(With little regard for the creatures they squeezed);
1890,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Their mill and mill-water and nether mill-stone
1891,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Tied fast to their infant; lo, this is the last"
1892,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Of their hungers, by prudent devices appeased."
1893,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The law they decree is their ultimate slave;
1894,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Wherein we perceive old Voracity glassed.
1895,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"It works from their dust, and it reeks of their grave."
1896,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Point them to greener, though Journals be guns;"
1897,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,To brotherly fields under fatherly skies;
1898,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Where the savage still primitive learns of a debt
1899,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,He has owed since he drummed on his belly for war;
1900,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And how for his giving, the more will he get;"
1901,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"For trusting his fellows, leave friends round his sons:"
1902,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Till they see, with the gape of a startled surprise,"
1903,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Their adored tyrant-monster a brute to abhor,"
1904,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The sun of their system a father of flies!
1905,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1906,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"So, for such good hope, take their scourge unashamed;"
1907,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"’Tis the portion of them who civilize,"
1908,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Who speak the word novel and true:
1909,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"How the brutish antique of our springs may be tamed,"
1910,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Without loss of the strength that should push us to flower;
1911,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"How the God of old time will act Satan of new,"
1912,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,If we keep him not straight at the higher God aimed;
1913,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For whose habitation within us we scour
1914,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,This house of our life; where our bitterest pains
1915,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Are those to eject the Infernal, who heaps"
1916,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Mire on the soul.  Take stripes or chains;
1917,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Grip at thy standard reviled.
1918,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And what if our body be dashed from the steeps?
1919,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Our spoken in protest remains.
1920,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,A young generation reaps.
1921,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1922,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"The young generation! ah, there is the child"
1923,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Of our souls down the Ages! to bleed for it, proof"
1924,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"That souls we have, with our senses filed,"
1925,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Our shuttles at thread of the woof.
1926,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"May it be braver than ours,"
1927,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To encounter the rattle of hostile bolts,"
1928,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,To look on the rising of Stranger Powers.
1929,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,May it know how the mind in expansion revolts
1930,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"From a nursery Past with dead letters aloof,"
1931,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And the piping to stupor of Precedents shun,"
1932,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,In a field where the forefather print of the hoof
1933,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Is not yet overgrassed by the watering hours,"
1934,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And should prompt us to Change, as to promise of sun,"
1935,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Till brain-rule splendidly towers.
1936,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For that large light we have laboured and tramped
1937,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thorough forests and bogland, still to perceive"
1938,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Our animate morning stamped
1939,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,With the lines of a sombre eve.
1940,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1941,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"A timorous thing ran the innocent hind,"
1942,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"When the wolf was the hypocrite fang under hood,"
1943,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"The snake a lithe lurker up sleeve,"
1944,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And the lion effulgently ramped.
1945,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Then our forefather hoof did its work in the wood,"
1946,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,By right of the better in kind.
1947,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,But now will it breed yon bestial brood
1948,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Three-fold thrice over, if bent to bind,"
1949,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"As the healthy in chains with the sick,"
1950,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Unto despot usage our issuing mind.
1951,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,It signifies battle or death’s dull knell.
1952,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Precedents icily written on high
1953,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Challenge the Tentatives hot to rebel.
1954,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Our Mother, who speeds her bloomful quick"
1955,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"For the march, reads which the impediment well."
1956,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,She smiles when of sapience is their boast.
1957,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,O loose of the tug between blood run dry
1958,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And blood running flame may our offspring run!
1959,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,May brain democratic be king of the host!
1960,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Less then shall the volumes of History tell
1961,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Of the stop in progression, the slip in relapse,"
1962,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,That counts us a sand-slack inch hard won
1963,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Beneath an oppressive incumbent perhaps.
1964,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1965,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Let the senile lords in a parchment sky,"
1966,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And the generous turbulents drunken of morn,"
1967,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Their battle of instincts put by,"
1968,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,A moment examine this field:
1969,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"On a Roman street cast thoughtful eye,"
1970,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Along to the mounts from the bog-forest weald.
1971,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"It merits a glance at our history’s maps,"
1972,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To see across Britain’s old shaggy unshorn,"
1973,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Through the Parties in strife internecine, foot"
1974,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The ruler’s close-reckoned direct to the mark.
1975,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"From the head ran the vanquisher’s orderly route,"
1976,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,In the stride of his forts through the tangle and dark.
1977,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"From the head runs the paved firm way for advance,"
1978,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"And we shoulder, we wrangle!  The light on us shed"
1979,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Shows dense beetle blackness in swarm, lurid Chance,"
1980,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"The Goddess of gamblers, above.  From the head,"
1981,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Then when it worked for the birth of a star
1982,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Fraternal with heaven’s in beauty and ray,"
1983,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Sprang the Acropolis.  Ask what crown
1984,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Comes of our tides of the blood at war,"
1985,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For men to bequeath generations down!
1986,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And ask what thou wast when the Purse was brimmed:
1987,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,What high-bounding ball for the Gods at play:
1988,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"A Conservative youth! who the cream-bowl skimmed,"
1989,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Desiring affairs to be left as they are.
1990,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
1991,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"So, thou takest Youth’s natural place in the fray,"
1992,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"As a Tentative, combating Peace,"
1993,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Our lullaby word for decay.—
1994,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,There will come an immediate decree
1995,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"In thy mind for the opposite party’s decease,"
1996,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,If he bends not an instant knee.
1997,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Expunge it: extinguishing counts poor gain.
1998,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And accept a mild word of police:—
1999,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Be mannerly, measured; refrain"
2000,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,From the puffings of him of the bagpipe cheeks.
2001,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Our political, even as the merchant main,"
2002,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,A temperate gale requires
2003,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For the ship that haven seeks;
2004,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Neither God of the winds nor his bellowsy squires.
2005,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
2006,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Then observe the antagonist, con"
2007,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,His reasons for rocking the lullaby word.
2008,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,You stand on a different stage of the stairs.
2009,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"He fought certain battles, yon senile lord."
2010,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"In the strength of thee, feel his bequest to his heirs."
2011,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"We are now on his inches of ground hard won,"
2012,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,For a perch to a flight o’er his resting fence.
2013,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
2014,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Does it knock too hard at thy head if I say,"
2015,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,That Time is both father and son?
2016,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Tough lesson, when senses are floods over sense!—"
2017,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Discern the paternal of Now
2018,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,As the Then of thy present tense.
2019,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"You may pull as you will either way,"
2020,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,You can never be other than one.
2021,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"So, be filial.  Giants to slay"
2022,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Demand knowing eyes in their Jack.
2023,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
2024,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,There are those whom we push from the path with respect.
2025,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Bow to that elder, though seeing him bow"
2026,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"To the backward as well, for a thunderous back"
2027,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Upon thee.  In his day he was not all wrong.
2028,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Unto some foundered zenith he strove, and was wrecked."
2029,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,He scrambled to shore with a worship of shore.
2030,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The Future he sees as the slippery murk;
2031,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,The Past as his doctrinal library lore.
2032,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,He stands now the rock to the wave’s wild wash.

2052,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,To the game our brutes best play.
2053,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
2054,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"But with rhetoric loose, can we check man’s brute?"
2055,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Assemblies of men on their legs invoke
2056,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Excitement for wholesome diversion: there shoot
2057,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Electrical sparks between their dry thatch

2062,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Then may it be rather the well-worn joke
2063,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Thou repeatest, to stop conflagration, and write"
2064,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Penance for rhetoric.  Strange will it seem,"

2088,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Rings it for Reason a melody clear,"
2089,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,We have bidden old Chaos retreat;

2097,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,It embraces or mortally bites.
2098,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,We have then the key-note for debate:

2100,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"Over discords, to shape and amend."
2101,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,
2102,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,And no singer is needed to serve
2103,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"The musical God, my friend."
2104,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Needs only his law on a sensible nerve:
2105,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,"A law that to Measure invites,"
2106,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Forbidding the passions contend.
2107,A SERMON TO OUR LATER PRODIGAL SON,Is it accepted of Song?

2339,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Robing the gilded beast, exact"
2340,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Abjection, while the crackskull name of Fate"
2341,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Is used to stamp and hallow printed fact;
2342,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A cruel corner lengthens up thy lips;
2343,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,These are thy game wherever men engage:
2344,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"These and, majestic in a borrowed shape,"
2345,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The major and the minor potentate,"
2346,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Creative of their various ape;—
2347,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The tiptoe mortals triumphing to write
2348,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Upon a perishable page
2349,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,An inch above their fellows’ height;—
2350,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The criers of foregone wisdom, who impose"
2351,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Its slough on live conditions, much for the greed"
2352,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of our first hungry figure wide agape;—
2353,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Call up thy hounds of laughter to their run.
2354,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"These, that would have men still of men be foes,"
2355,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Eternal fox to prowl and pike to feed;
2356,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Would keep our life the whirly pool
2357,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of turbid stuff dishonouring History;
2358,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The herd the drover’s herd, the fool the fool,"
2359,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Ourself our slavish self’s infernal sun:
2360,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,These are the children of the heart untaught
2361,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"By thy quick founts to beat abroad, by thee"
2362,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Untamed to tone its passions under thought,"
2363,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The rich humaneness reading in thy fun.
2364,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of them a world of coltish heels for school
2365,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,We have; a world with driving wrecks bestrewn.
2366,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2367,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"’Tis written of the Gods of human mould,"
2368,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Those Nectar Gods, of glorious stature hewn"
2369,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To quicken hymns, that they did hear, incensed,"
2370,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Satiric comments overbold,"
2371,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,From one whose part was by decree
2372,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The jester’s; but they boiled to feel him bite.
2373,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Better for them had they with Reason fenced
2374,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Or smiled corrected!  They in the great Gods’ might
2375,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Their prober crushed, as fingers flea."
2376,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Crumbled Olympus when the sovereign sire
2377,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"His fatal kick to Momus gave, albeit"
2378,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Men could behold the sacred Mount aspire,"
2379,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The Satirist pass by on limping feet.
2380,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Those Gods who saw the ejected laugh alight
2381,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Below had then their last of airy glee;
2382,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"They in the cup sought Laughter’s drownèd sprite,"
2383,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Fed to dire fatness off uncurbed conceit.
2384,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Eyes under saw them waddle on their Mount,"
2385,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And drew them down; to flattest earth they rolled.
2386,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,This know we veritable.  O Sage of Mirth!
2387,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Can it be true, the story men recount"
2388,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of the fall’n plight of the great Gods on earth?
2389,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"How they being deathless, though of human mould,"
2390,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"With human cravings, undecaying frames,"
2391,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Must labour for subsistence; are a band
2392,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Whom a loose-cheeked, wide-lipped gay cripple leads"
2393,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,At haunts of holiday on summer sand:
2394,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And lightly he will hint to one that heeds
2395,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Names in pained designation of them, names"
2396,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Ensphered on blue skies and on black, which twirl"
2397,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Our hearing madly from our seeing dazed,"
2398,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Add Bacchus unto both; and he entreats
2399,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,(His baby dimples in maternal chaps
2400,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Running wild labyrinths of line and curl)
2401,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Compassion for his masterful Trombone,"
2402,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Whose thunder is the brass of how he blazed
2403,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Of old: for him of the mountain-muscle feats,"
2404,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Who guts a drum to fetch a snappish groan:
2405,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For his fierce bugler horning onset, whom"
2406,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A truncheon-battered helmet caps . . .
2407,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The creature is of earnest mien
2408,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,To plead a sorrow darker than the tomb.
2409,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"His Harp and Triangle, in tone subdued,"
2410,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,He names; they are a rayless red and white;
2411,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The dawn-hued libertine, the gibbous prude."
2412,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And, if we recognize his Tambourine,"
2413,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,He asks; exhausted names her: she has become
2414,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A globe in cupolas; the blowziest queen
2415,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of overflowing dome on dome;
2416,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Redundancy contending with the tight,"
2417,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Leaping the dam!  He fondly calls, his girl,"
2418,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The buxom tripper with the goblet-smile,"
2419,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Refreshful.  O but now his brows are dun,"
2420,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Bunched are his lips, as when distilling guile,"
2421,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To drop his venomous: the Dame of dames,"
2422,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Flower of the world, that honey one,"
2423,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"She of the earthly rose in the sea-pearl,"
2424,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,To whom the world ran ocean for her kiss;
2425,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"He names her, as a worshipper he names,"
2426,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And indicates with a contemptuous thumb.
2427,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The lady meanwhile lures the mob, alike"
2428,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Ogles the bursters of the horn and drum.
2429,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Curtain her close! her open arms
2430,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Have suckers for beholders: she to this?
2431,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For that she could not, save in fury, hear"
2432,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A sharp corrective utterance flick
2433,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Her idle manners, for the laugh to strike"
2434,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Beauty so breeding beauty, without peer"
2435,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Above the snows, among the flowers?  She reaps"
2436,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,This mouldy garner of the fatal kick?
2437,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Gross with the sacrifice of Circe-swarms,"
2438,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Astarte of vile sweets that slay, malign,"
2439,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"From Greek resplendent to Phoenician foul,"
2440,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The trader in attractions sinks, all brine"
2441,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To thoughts of taste; is ’t love?—bark, dog! hoot, owl!"
2442,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And she is blushless: ancient worship weeps.
2443,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Suicide Graces dangle down the charms
2444,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Sprawling like gourds on outer garden-heaps.
2445,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,She stands in her unholy oily leer
2446,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"A statue losing feature, weather-sick"
2447,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Mid draggled creepers of twined ivy sere.
2448,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The curtain cried for magnifies to see!—
2449,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,We cannot quench our one corrupting glance:
2450,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The vision of the rumour will not flee.
2451,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Doth the Boy own such Mother?—shoot his dart
2452,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To bring her, countless as the crested deeps,"
2453,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Her subjects of the uncorrected heart?
2454,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"False is that vision, shrieks the devotee;"
2455,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Incredible, we echo; and anew"
2456,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Like a far growling lightning-cloud it leaps.
2457,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Low humourist this leader seems; perchance
2458,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Pitched from his University career,"
2459,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Adept at classic fooling.  Yet of mould
2460,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Human those Gods were: deathless too:
2461,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,On high they not as meditatives paced:
2462,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Prodigiously they did the deeds of flesh:
2463,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Descending, they would touch the lowest here:"
2464,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And she, that lighted form of blue and gold,"
2465,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Whom the seas gave, all earth, all earth embraced;"
2466,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Exulting in the great hauls of her mesh;
2467,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Desired and hated, desperately dear;"
2468,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Most human of them was.  No more pursue!
2469,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Enough that the black story can be told.
2470,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,It preaches to the eminently placed:
2471,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For whom disastrous wreckage is nigh due,"
2472,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Paints omen.  Truly they our throbber had;
2473,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The passions plumping, passions playing leech,"
2474,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Cunning to trick us for the day’s good cheer.
2475,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Our uncorrected human heart will swell
2476,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To notions monstrous, doings mad"
2477,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,As billows on a foam-lashed beach;
2478,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Borne on the tides of alternating heats,"
2479,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Will drug the brain, will doom the soul as well;"
2480,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Call the closed mouth of that harsh final Power
2481,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To speak in judgement: Nemesis, the fell:"
2482,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Of those bright Gods assembled, offspring sour;"
2483,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The last surviving on the upper seats;
2484,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,As with men Reason when their hearts rebel.
2485,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2486,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Ah, what a fruitless breeder is this heart,"
2487,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Full of the mingled seeds, each eating each."
2488,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Not wiser of our mark than at the start,"
2489,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,It surges like the wrath-faced father Sea
2490,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To countering winds; a force blind-eyed,"
2491,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,On endless rounds of aimless reach;
2492,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Emotion for the source of pride,"
2493,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The grounds of faith in fixity
2494,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Above our flesh; its cravings urging speech,"
2495,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Inspiring prayer; by turns a lump
2496,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Swung on a time-piece, and by turns"
2497,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A quivering energy to jump
2498,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For seats angelical: it shrinks, it yearns,"
2499,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Loves, loathes; is flame or cinders; lastly cloud"
2500,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Capping a sullen crater: and mankind
2501,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"We see cloud-capped, an army of the dark,"
2502,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Because of thy straight leadership declined;
2503,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,At heels of this or that delusive spark:
2504,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Now when the multitudinous races press
2505,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Elbow to elbow hourly more,"
2506,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A thickened host; when now we hear aloud
2507,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Life for the very life implore
2508,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A signal of a visioned mark;
2509,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Light of the mind, the mind’s discourse,"
2510,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The rational in graciousness,"
2511,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Thee by acknowledgement enthroned,"
2512,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,To tame and lead that blind-eyed force
2513,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"In harmony of harness with the crowd,"
2514,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For payment of their dues; as yet disowned,"
2515,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Save where some dutiful lone creature, vowed"
2516,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To holy work, deems it the heart’s intent;"
2517,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Or where a silken circle views it cowled,"
2518,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The seeming figure of concordance, bent"
2519,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,On satiating tyrant lust
2520,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Or barren fits of sentiment.
2521,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2522,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Thou wilt not have our paths befouled
2523,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"By simulation; are we vile to view,"
2524,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The heavens shall see us clean of our own dust,"
2525,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Beneath thy breezy flitting wing:
2526,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,They make their mirror upon faces true;
2527,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And where they win reflection, lucid heave"
2528,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The under tides of this hot heart seen through.
2529,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Beneficently wilt thou clip
2530,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"All oversteppings of the plumed,"
2531,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The puffed, and bid the masker strip,"
2532,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And into the crowned windbag thrust,"
2533,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Tearing the mortal from the vital thing,"
2534,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"A lightning o’er the half-illumed,"
2535,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Who to base brute-dominion cleave,"
2536,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Yet mark effects, and shun the flash,"
2537,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Till their drowsed wits a beam conceive,"
2538,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To spy a wound without a gash,"
2539,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"The magic in a turn of wrist,"
2540,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And how are wedded heart and head regaled
2541,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"When Wit o’er Folly blows the mort,"
2542,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And their high note of union spreads
2543,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Wide from the timely word with conquest charged;
2544,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Victorious laughter, of no loud report,"
2545,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,If heard; derision as divinely veiled
2546,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"As terrible Immortals in rose-mist,"
2547,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Given to the vision of arrested men:
2548,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Whereat they feel within them weave
2549,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Community its closer threads,"
2550,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And are to our fraternal state enlarged;
2551,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Like warm fresh blood is their enlivened ken:
2552,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"They learn that thou art not of alien sort,"
2553,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Speaking the tongue by vipers hissed,"
2554,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Or of the frosty heights unsealed,"
2555,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Or of the vain who simple speech distort,"
2556,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Or of the vapours pointing on to nought
2557,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Along cold skies; though sharp and high thy pitch;
2558,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"As when sole homeward the belated treads,"
2559,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And hears aloft a clamour wailed,"
2560,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,That once had seemed the broomstick witch
2561,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Horridly violating cloud for drought:
2562,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"He, from the rub of minds dispersing fears,"
2563,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Hears migrants marshalling their midnight train;
2564,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Homeliest order in black sky appears,"
2565,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Not less than in the lighted village steads.
2566,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,So do those half-illumed wax clear to share
2567,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,A cry that is our common voice; the note
2568,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Of fellowship upon a loftier plane,"
2569,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Above embattled castle-wall and moat;
2570,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And toning drops as from pure heaven it sheds.
2571,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"So thou for washing a phantasmal air,"
2572,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For thy sweet singing keynote of the wise,"
2573,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Laughter—the joy of Reason seeing fade
2574,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Obstruction into Earth’s renewing beds,"
2575,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Beneath the stroke of her good servant’s blade—
2576,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Thenceforth art as their earth-star hailed;
2577,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Gain of the years, conjunction’s prize."
2578,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The greater heart in thy appeal to heads
2579,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"They see, thou Captain of our civil Fort!"
2580,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,By more elusive savages assailed
2581,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,On each ascending stage; untired
2582,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Both inner foe and outer to cut short,"
2583,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And blow to chaff pretenders void of grist:
2584,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Showing old tiger’s claws, old crocodile’s"
2585,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Yard-grin of eager grinders, slim to sight,"
2586,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Like forms in running water, oft when smiles,"
2587,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"When pearly tears, when fluent lips delight:"
2588,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,But never with the slayer’s malice fired:
2589,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,As little as informs an infant’s fist
2590,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Clenched at the sneeze!  Thou wouldst but have us be
2591,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Good sons of mother soil, whereby to grow"
2592,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Branching on fairer skies, one stately tree;"
2593,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Broad of the tilth for flowering at the Court:
2594,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Which is the tree bound fast to wave its tress;
2595,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of strength controlled sheer beauty to bestow.
2596,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Ambrosial heights of possible acquist,"
2597,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Where souls of men with soul of man consort,"
2598,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And all look higher to new loveliness
2599,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Begotten of the look: thy mark is there;
2600,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"While on our temporal ground alive,"
2601,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Rightly though fearfully thou wieldest sword
2602,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Of finer temper now a numbered learn
2603,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,That they resisting thee themselves resist;
2604,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And not thy bigger joy to smite and drive,"
2605,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Prompt the dense herd to butt, and set the snare"
2606,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Witching them into pitfalls for hoarse shouts.
2607,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"More now, and hourly more, and of the Lord"
2608,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Thou lead’st to, doth this rebel heart discern,"
2609,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,When pinched ascetic and red sensualist
2610,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Alternately recurrent freeze or burn,"
2611,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And of its old religions it has doubts.
2612,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,It fears thee less when thou hast shown it bare;
2613,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Less hates, part understands, nor much resents,"
2614,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"When the prized objects it has raised for prayer,"
2615,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For fitful prayer;—repentance dreading fire,"
2616,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Impelled by aches; the blindness which repents
2617,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Like the poor trampled worm that writhes in mire;—
2618,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Are sounded by thee, and thou darest probe"
2619,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Old institutions and establishments,"
2620,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Once fortresses against the floods of sin,"
2621,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,For what their worth; and questioningly prod
2622,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"For why they stand upon a racing globe,"
2623,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Impeding blocks, less useful than the clod;"
2624,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Their angel out of them, a demon in."
2625,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2626,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"This half-enlightened heart, still doomed to fret,"
2627,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"To hurl at vanities, to drift in shame"
2628,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Of gain or loss, bewailing the sure rod,"
2629,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Shall of predestination wed thee yet.
2630,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Something it gathers of what things should drop
2631,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,At entrance on new times; of how thrice broad
2632,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The world of minds communicative; how
2633,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"A straggling Nature classed in school, and scored"
2634,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"With stripes admonishing, may yield to plough"
2635,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Fruitfullest furrows, nor for waxing tame"
2636,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Be feeble on an Earth whose gentler crop
2637,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Is its most living, in the mind that steers,"
2638,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"By Reason led, her way of tree and flame,"
2639,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Beyond the genuflexions and the tears;
2640,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Upon an Earth that cannot stop,"
2641,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Where upward is the visible aim,"
2642,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"And ever we espy the greater God,"
2643,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,For simple pointing at a good adored:
2644,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Proof of the closer neighbourhood.  Head on,"
2645,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Sword of the many, light of the few! untwist"
2646,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Or cut our tangles till fair space is won
2647,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Beyond a briared wood of austere brow,"
2648,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Believed of discord by thy timely word
2649,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,At intervals refreshing life: for thou
2650,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Art verify Keeper of the Muse’s Key;
2651,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Thyself no vacant melodist;
2652,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,On lower land elective even as she;
2653,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,"Holding, as she, all dissonance abhorred;"
2654,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Advising to her measured steps in flow;
2655,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,And teaching how for being subjected free
2656,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,Past thought of freedom we may come to know
2657,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,The music of the meaning of Accord.
2658,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2659,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2660,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2661,TO THE COMIC SPIRIT,
2662,YOUTH IN MEMORY,YOUTH IN MEMORY
2663,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2664,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2665,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"DAYS, when the ball of our vision"
2666,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Had eagles that flew unabashed to sun;
2667,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"When the grasp on the bow was decision,"
2668,YOUTH IN MEMORY,And arrow and hand and eye were one;
2669,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"When the Pleasures, like waves to a swimmer,"
2670,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Came heaving for rapture ahead!—
2671,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Invoke them, they dwindle, they glimmer"
2672,YOUTH IN MEMORY,As lights over mounds of the dead.
2673,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2674,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Behold the winged Olympus, off the mead,"
2675,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"With thunder of wide pinions, lightning speed,"
2676,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Wafting the shepherd-boy through ether clear,"
2677,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To bear the golden nectar-cup.
2678,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"So flies desire at view of its delight,"
2679,YOUTH IN MEMORY,When the young heart is tiptoe perched on sight.
2680,YOUTH IN MEMORY,We meanwhile who in hues of the sick year
2681,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"The Spring-time paint to prick us for our lost,"
2682,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Mount but the fatal half way up—
2683,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Whereon shut eyes!  This is decreed,"
2684,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"For Age that would to youthful heavens ascend,"
2685,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"By passion for the arms’ possession tossed,"
2686,YOUTH IN MEMORY,It falls the way of sighs and hath their end;
2687,YOUTH IN MEMORY,A spark gone out to more sepulchral night.
2688,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Good if the arrowy eagle of the height
2689,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Be then the little bird that hops to feed.
2690,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2691,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Lame falls the cry to kindle days
2692,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Of radiant orb and daring gaze.
2693,YOUTH IN MEMORY,It does but clank our mortal chain.
2694,YOUTH IN MEMORY,For Earth reads through her felon old
2695,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"The many-numbered of her fold,"
2696,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Who forward tottering backward strain,"
2697,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And would be thieves of treasure spent,"
2698,YOUTH IN MEMORY,With their grey season soured.
2699,YOUTH IN MEMORY,She could write out their history in their thirst
2700,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"To have again the much devoured,"
2701,YOUTH IN MEMORY,And be the bud at burst;
2702,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"In honey fancy join the flow,"
2703,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Where Youth swims on as once they went,"
2704,YOUTH IN MEMORY,All choiric for spontaneous glee
2705,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Of active eager lungs and thews;
2706,YOUTH IN MEMORY,They now bared roots beside the river bent;
2707,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Whose privilege themselves to see;
2708,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Their place in yonder tideway know;
2709,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The current glass peruse;
2710,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The depths intently sound;
2711,YOUTH IN MEMORY,And sapped by each returning flood
2712,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Accept for monitory nourishment
2713,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Those worn roped features under crust of mud,"
2714,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Reflected in the silvery smooth around:
2715,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Not less the branching and high singing tree,"
2716,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"A home of nests, a landmark and a tent,"
2717,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Until their hour for losing hold on ground.
2718,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Even such good harvest of the things that flee
2719,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Earth offers her subjected, and they choose"
2720,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Rather of Bacchic Youth one beam to drink,"
2721,YOUTH IN MEMORY,And warm slow marrow with the sensual wink.
2722,YOUTH IN MEMORY,So block they at her source the Mother of the Muse.
2723,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2724,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Who cheerfully the little bird becomes,"
2725,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Without a fall, and pipes for peck at crumbs,"
2726,YOUTH IN MEMORY,May have her dolings to the lightest touch;
2727,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"As where some cripple muses by his crutch,"
2728,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Unwitting that the spirit in him sings:
2729,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"‘When I had legs, then had I wings,"
2730,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"As good as any born of eggs,"
2731,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"To feed on all aërial things,"
2732,YOUTH IN MEMORY,When I had legs!’
2733,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And if not to embrace he sighs,"
2734,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"She gives him breath of Youth awhile,"
2735,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Perspective of a breezy mile,"
2736,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Companionable hedgeways, lifting skies;"
2737,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Scenes where his nested dreams upon their hoard
2738,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Brooded, or up to empyrean soared:"
2739,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Enough to link him with a dotted line.
2740,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"But cravings for an eagle’s flight,"
2741,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To top white peaks and serve wild wine
2742,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Among the rosy undecayed,"
2743,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Bring only flash of shade
2744,YOUTH IN MEMORY,From her full throbbing breast of day in night.
2745,YOUTH IN MEMORY,By what they crave are they betrayed:
2746,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And cavernous is that young dragon’s jaw,"
2747,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Crimson for all the fiery reptile saw
2748,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"In time now coveted, for teeth to flay,"
2749,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Once more consume, were Life recurrent May."
2750,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"They to their moment of drawn breath,"
2751,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Which is the life that makes the death,"
2752,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The death that makes ethereal life would bind:
2753,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The death that breeds the spectre do they find.
2754,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Darkness is wedded and the waste regrets
2755,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Beating as dead leaves on a fitful gust,"
2756,YOUTH IN MEMORY,By souls no longer dowered to climb
2757,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Beneath their pack of dust,"
2758,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Whom envy of a lustrous prime,"
2759,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Eclipsed while yet invoked, besets,"
2760,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And dooms to sink and water sable flowers,"
2761,YOUTH IN MEMORY,That never gladdened eye or loaded bee.
2762,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Strain we the arms for Memory’s hours,"
2763,YOUTH IN MEMORY,We are the seized Persephone.
2764,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Responsive never to the soft desire
2765,YOUTH IN MEMORY,For one prized tune is this our chord of life.
2766,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"’Tis clipped to deadness with a wanton knife,"
2767,YOUTH IN MEMORY,In wishes that for ecstasies aspire.
2768,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Yet have we glad companionship of Youth,"
2769,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Elysian meadows for the mind,"
2770,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Dare we to face deeds done, and in our tomb"
2771,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Filled with the parti-coloured bloom
2772,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Of loved and hated, grasp all human truth"
2773,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Sowed by us down the mazy paths behind.
2774,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To feel that heaven must we that hell sound through:
2775,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Whence comes a line of continuity,"
2776,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"That brings our middle station into view,"
2777,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Between those poles; a novel Earth we see,"
2778,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"In likeness of us, made of banned and blest;"
2779,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"The sower’s bed, but not the reaper’s rest:"
2780,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"An Earth alive with meanings, wherein meet"
2781,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Buried, and breathing, and to be."
2782,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Then of the junction of the three,"
2783,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Even as a heart in brain, full sweet"
2784,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"May sense of soul, the sum of music, beat."
2785,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2786,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Only the soul can walk the dusty track
2787,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Where hangs our flowering under vapours black,"
2788,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And bear to see how these pervade, obscure,"
2789,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Quench recollection of a spacious pure.
2790,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"They take phantasmal forms, divide, convolve,"
2791,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Hard at each other point and gape,"
2792,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Horrible ghosts! in agony dissolve,"
2793,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To reappear with one they drape
2794,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"For criminal, and, Father! shrieking name,"
2795,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Who such distorted issue did beget.
2796,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Accept them, them and him, though hiss thy sweat"
2797,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Off brow on breast, whose furnace flame"
2798,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Has eaten, and old Self consumes."
2799,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Out of the purification will they leap,"
2800,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Thee renovating while new light illumes
2801,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"The dusky web of evil, known as pain,"
2802,YOUTH IN MEMORY,That heavily up healthward mounts the steep;
2803,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Our fleshly road to beacon-fire of brain:
2804,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Midway the tameless oceanic brute
2805,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Below, whose heave is topped with foam for fruit,"
2806,YOUTH IN MEMORY,And the fair heaven reflecting inner peace
2807,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"On righteous warfare, that asks not to cease."
2808,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2809,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Forth of such passage through black fire we win
2810,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Clear hearing of the simple lute,"
2811,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Whereon, and not on other, Memory plays"
2812,YOUTH IN MEMORY,For them who can in quietness receive
2813,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Her restorative airs: a ditty thin
2814,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"As note of hedgerow bird in ear of eve,"
2815,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Or wave at ebb, the shallow catching rays"
2816,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"On a transparent sheet, where curves a glass"
2817,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To truer heavens than when the breaker neighs
2818,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Loud at the plunge for bubbly wreck in roar.
2819,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Solidity and bulk and martial brass,"
2820,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Once tyrants of the senses, faintly score"
2821,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"A mark on pebbled sand or fluid slime,"
2822,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"While present in the spirit, vital there,"
2823,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Are things that seemed the phantoms of their time;
2824,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Eternal as the recurrent cloud, as air"
2825,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Imperative, refreshful as dawn-dew."
2826,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Some evanescent hand on vapour scrawled
2827,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Historic of the soul, and heats anew"
2828,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Its coloured lines where deeds of flesh stand bald.
2829,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"True of the man, and of mankind ’tis true,"
2830,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Did we stout battle with the Shade, Despair,"
2831,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Our cowardice, it blooms; or haply warred"
2832,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Against the primal beast in us, and flung;"
2833,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Or cleaving mists of Sorrow, left it starred"
2834,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Above self-pity slain: or it was Prayer
2835,YOUTH IN MEMORY,First taken for Life’s cleanser; or the tongue
2836,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Spake for the world against this heart; or rings
2837,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Old laughter, from the founts of wisdom sprung;"
2838,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Or clap of wing of joy, that was a throb"
2839,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"From breast of Earth, and did no creature rob:"
2840,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"These quickening live.  But deepest at her springs,"
2841,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Most filial, is an eye to love her young."
2842,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And had we it, to see with it, alive"
2843,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Is our lost garden, flower, bird and hive."
2844,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Blood of her blood, aim of her aim, are then"
2845,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The green-robed and grey-crested sons of men:
2846,YOUTH IN MEMORY,She tributary to her aged restores
2847,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The living in the dead; she will inspire
2848,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Faith homelier than on the Yonder shores,"
2849,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Abhorring these as mire,"
2850,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Uncertain steps, in dimness gropes,"
2851,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"With mortal tremours pricking hopes,"
2852,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And, by the final Bacchic of the lusts"
2853,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Propelled, the Bacchic of the spirit trusts:"
2854,YOUTH IN MEMORY,A fervour drunk from mystic hierophants;
2855,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Not utterly misled, though blindly led,"
2856,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Led round fermenting eddies.  Faith she plants
2857,YOUTH IN MEMORY,In her own firmness as our midway road:
2858,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Which rightly Youth has read, though blindly read;"
2859,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Her essence reading in her toothsome goad;
2860,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Spur of bright dreams experience disenchants.
2861,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"But love we well the young, her road midway"
2862,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The darknesses runs consecrated clay.
2863,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Despite our feeble hold on this green home,"
2864,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And the vast outer strangeness void of dome,"
2865,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Shall we be with them, of them, taught to feel,"
2866,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Up to the moment of our prostrate fall,"
2867,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The life they deem voluptuously real
2868,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Is more than empty echo of a call,"
2869,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Or shadow of a shade, or swing of tides;"
2870,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"As brooding upon age, when veins congeal,"
2871,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Grey palsy nods to think.  With us for guides,"
2872,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Another step above the animal,"
2873,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To views in Alpine thought are they helped on.
2874,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Good if so far we live in them when gone!
2875,YOUTH IN MEMORY,
2876,YOUTH IN MEMORY,And there the arrowy eagle of the height
2877,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Becomes the little bird that hops to feed,"
2878,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Glad of a crumb, for tempered appetite"
2879,YOUTH IN MEMORY,To make it wholesome blood and fruitful seed.
2880,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Then Memory strikes on no slack string,"
2881,YOUTH IN MEMORY,Nor sectional will varied Life appear:
2882,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Perforce of soul discerned in mind, we hear"
2883,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Earth with her Onward chime, with Winter Spring."
2884,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"And ours the mellow note, while sharing joys"
2885,YOUTH IN MEMORY,No more subjecting mortals who have learnt
2886,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"To build for happiness on equipoise,"
2887,YOUTH IN MEMORY,The Pleasures read in sparks of substance burnt;
2888,YOUTH IN MEMORY,"Know in our seasons an integral wheel,"
2889,YOUTH IN MEMORY,That rolls us to a mark may yet be willed.

2953,NIGHT OF FROST IN MAY,"Across the tracks of rimy tan,"
2954,NIGHT OF FROST IN MAY,Some busy thread at whiles would shoot;

2985,NIGHT OF FROST IN MAY,Ere men desired and joyed or wept.
2986,NIGHT OF FROST IN MAY,Or now a legion ravishing
2987,NIGHT OF FROST IN MAY,Musician rivals did unite

3423,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"—Despair lies down and grovels, grapples not"

3431,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"That know I, though the echoes of it wail,"
3432,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,For one step upward on the crags you scale.

3454,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"No extramural God, the God within"
3455,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Alone gives aid to city charged with sin.
3456,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,A world that for the spur of fool and knave
3457,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Sweats in its laboratory what shall save?
3458,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,But men who ply their wits in such a school
3459,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Must pray the mercy of the knave and fool.
3460,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
3461,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,—Much have I studied hard Necessity!
3462,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To know her Wisdom’s mother, and that we"
3463,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,May deem the harshness of her later cries
3464,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"In labour a sure goad to prick the wise,"
3465,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,If men among the warnings which convulse
3466,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Can gravely dread without the craven’s pulse.
3467,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Long ere the rising of this age of ours,"
3468,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The knave and fool were stamped as monstrous Powers.
3469,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Of human lusts and lassitudes they spring,"
3470,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And are as lasting as the parent thing.
3471,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Yet numbering locust hosts, bent they to drill,"
3472,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,They might o’ermatch and have mankind at will.
3473,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Behold such army gathering; ours the spur,"
3474,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"No scattered foe to face, but Lucifer."
3475,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Not fool or knave is now the enemy
3476,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"O’ershadowing men, ’tis Folly, Knavery!"
3477,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,A sea; nor stays that sea the bastioned beach.
3478,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Now must the brother soul alive in each
3479,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,His traitorous individual devildom
3480,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Hold subject lest the grand destruction come.
3481,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Dimly men see it menacing apace

3486,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Shines visible as life on either field.
3487,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"That is my comfort, following shock on shock,"
3488,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Which sets faith quaking on their firmest rock.
3489,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Since with his weapons, all the arms of Night,"
3490,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Frail men have challenged Lucifer to fight,"
3491,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Have matched in hostile ranks, enrolled, erect,"
3492,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The human and Satanic intellect,"
3493,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Determined for their uses to control
3494,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"What forces on the earth and under roll,"
3495,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Their granite rock runs igneous; now they stand
3496,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Pledged to the heavens for safety of their land.
3497,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"They cannot learn save grossly, gross that are:"

3501,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Their field of tares they take for pasture grass.
3502,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,How waken them that have not any bent
3503,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Save browsing—the concrete indifferent!
3504,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Friend Lucifer supplies them solid stuff:
3505,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,They fear not for the race when full the trough.
3506,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,They have much fear of giving up the ghost;
3507,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And these are of mankind the unnumbered host.
3508,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
3509,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"—If I could see with you, and did not faint"

3511,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Those massed indifferents will learn to quake:
3512,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Now meanwhile is another mass awake,"
3513,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Once denser than the grunters of the sty.

3519,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"—O true, they have a cause, and woe for us,"
3520,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,While still they have a cause too piteous!
3521,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Yet, happy for us when, their cause defined,"
3522,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"They walk no longer with a stumbler blind,"
3523,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And quicken in the virtue of their cause,"
3524,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,To think me a poor mouther of old saws!
3525,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,I wait the issue of a battling Age;

3527,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Instructing them, through their acutest sense,"
3528,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,How close the dangers of indifference!
3529,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Already have my people shown their worth,"
3530,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"More love they light, which folds the love of Earth."
3531,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,That love to love of labour leads: thence love
3532,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Of humankind—earth’s incense flung above.
3533,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,

3548,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"At intervals, in proof of whom they came."
3549,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,To strengthen our foundations is the task
3550,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Of this tough Age; not in your beams to bask,"

3553,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,My sister sees no round beyond her mood;

3555,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Out of the course of ancient ruts and grooves,"
3556,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,It moves: O much for me to say it moves!
3557,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"About his Æthiop Highlands Nile is Nile,"
3558,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Though not the stream of the paternal smile:
3559,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And where his tide of nourishment he drives,"
3560,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,An Abyssinian wantonness revives.
3561,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Calm as his lotus-leaf to-day he swims;
3562,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"He is the yellow crops, the rounded limbs,"
3563,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The Past yet flowing, the fair time that fills;"
3564,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Breath of all mouths and grist of many mills.
3565,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To-morrow, warning none with tempest-showers,"
3566,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,He is the vast Insensate who devours
3567,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"His golden promise over leagues of seed,"
3568,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Then sits in a smooth lake upon the deed.
3569,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The races which on barbarous force begin
3570,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Inherit onward of their origin,"
3571,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And cancelled blessings will the current length
3572,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Reveal till they know need of shaping strength.
3573,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,’Tis not in men to recognize the need

3580,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Save for the troublous blood which makes him strong.
3581,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,—That rings of truth!  More do your people thrive;

3583,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Than erewhile when I gloried in the page
3584,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Of radiant singer and anointed sage.
3585,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Greece was my lamp: burnt out for lack of oil;

3595,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"At which oppressive scene, beyond arrest,"

3893,V,"To cloud celestially sown,"
3894,V,Ran venom of what nourishment
3895,V,Her dark sustainer subterrene

3897,V,"Alive in the shrewd nerves, the seething brains,"

3906,VI,Her skies shot black.
3907,VI,Now was it visioned infamy to drink
3908,VI,"Of earth’s cool dew, and through the vines"
3909,VI,"Frolic in pearly laughter with her young,"
3910,VI,"Watching the healthful, natural, happy signs"
3911,VI,"Where hands of lads and maids like tendrils clung,"
3912,VI,"After their sly shy ventures from the leaf,"
3913,VI,And promised bunches.  Now it seemed
3914,VI,"The world was one malarious mire,"
3915,VI,Crying for purification: chief
3916,VI,This land of France.  It seemed
3917,VI,A duteous desire

3926,VII,"Her lover flew,"
3927,VII,There swept a shudder over men.
3928,VII,"Her heavenly lover fled her, and she laughed,"

3937,VIII,Her heart a flaring torch usurped her wits.
3938,VIII,Such enemies of her next-drawn breath she had!
3939,VIII,To tread her down in her live grave beneath
3940,VIII,"Their dancing floor sunned blind by the Royal wreath,"
3941,VIII,They ringed her steps with crafty prison pits.
3942,VIII,"Without they girdled her, made nest within."
3943,VIII,"There ramped the lion, here entrailed the snake."
3944,VIII,They forced the cup to her lips when she drank blood;
3945,VIII,"Believing it, in the mother’s mind at strain,"
3946,VIII,"In the mother’s fears, and in young Liberty’s wail"
3947,VIII,"Alarmed, for her encompassed children’s sake,"
3948,VIII,The sole sure way to save her priceless bud.
3949,VIII,"Wherewith, when power had gifted her to prevail,"
3950,VIII,Vengeance appeared as logically akin.
3951,VIII,Insanely rational they; she rationally insane;

3961,IX,The Fury mourned and raged and bled for France
3962,IX,Breathing from exultation to despair
3963,IX,At every wild-winged hope struck by mischance
3964,IX,Soaring at each faint gleam o’er her abyss.
3965,IX,"Heard still, to be heard while France shall stand erect,"
3966,IX,"The frontier march she piped her sons, for where"

4067,XIII,"False to her bridegroom lord of the miracle day,"

4076,XIII,More strongly the divine in him than when
4077,XIII,Joy of her as she sprang from mould
4078,XIII,Drew him the midway heavens adown
4079,XIII,To clasp her in his arms espoused
4080,XIII,"Before the sight of wondering men,"
4081,XIII,And put upon the day a deathless crown.
4082,XIII,"The veins and arteries of her, fold in fold,"
4083,XIII,"His alien love laid open, to divide"
4084,XIII,The martyred creature from her crimes; he knew
4085,XIII,What cowardice in her valour could reside;
4086,XIII,What strength her weakness covered; what abased
4087,XIII,"Sublimity so illumining, and what raised"
4088,XIII,"This wallower in old slime to noblest heights,"
4089,XIII,Up to the union on the midway blue:—
4090,XIII,Day that the celestial grave Recorder hangs
4091,XIII,"Among dark History’s nocturnal lights,"
4092,XIII,With vivid beams indicative to the quick
4093,XIII,Of all who have felt the vaulted body’s pangs
4094,XIII,Beneath a mind in hopeless soaring sick.
4095,XIII,"She had forgot how, long enslaved, she yearned"
4096,XIII,To the one helping hand above;
4097,XIII,"Forgot her faith in the Great Undiscerned,"
4098,XIII,Whereof she sprang aloft to her Angelical love
4099,XIII,"That day: and he, the bright day’s husband, still with love,"
4100,XIII,"Though alien, though to an upper seat retired,"
4101,XIII,"Behold a wrangling heart, as ’twere her soul"
4102,XIII,On eddies of wild waters cast;
4103,XIII,In wilderness division; fired
4104,XIII,"For domination, freedom, lust,"
4105,XIII,"The Pleasures; lo, a witch’s snaky bowl"
4106,XIII,Set at her lips; the blood-drinker’s madness fast
4107,XIII,"Upon her; and therewith mistrust,"
4108,XIII,Most of herself: a mouth of guile.
4109,XIII,"Compassionately could he smile,"
4110,XIII,"To hear the mouth disclaiming God,"
4111,XIII,And clamouring for the Just!
4112,XIII,"Her thousand impulses, like torches, coursed"
4113,XIII,City and field; and pushed abroad
4114,XIII,"O’er hungry waves to thirsty sands,"
4115,XIII,Flaring at further; she had grown to be
4116,XIII,The headless with the fearful hands;
4117,XIII,"To slaughter, else to suicide, enforced."
4118,XIII,"But he, remembering how his love began,"
4119,XIII,"And of what creature, pitied when was plain"
4120,XIII,Another measure of captivity:
4121,XIII,The need for strap and rod;
4122,XIII,The penitential prayers again;
4123,XIII,Again the bitter bowing down to dust;
4124,XIII,"The burden on the flesh for who disclaims the God,"
4125,XIII,The answer when is call upon the Just.
4126,XIII,Whence her lost virtue had found refuge strode
4127,XIII,"Her master, saying, ‘I only; I who can!’"
4128,XIII,"And echoed round her army, now her chain."
4129,XIII,"So learns the nation, closing Anarch’s reign,"
4130,XIII,That she had been in travail of a Man.

4281,IV,At fettered wrists and violated laws
4282,IV,"Faith in a rectitude Supernal shook,"
4283,IV,"Till worship of him shone as her last rational state,"
4284,IV,The slave’s apology for gemmed disgrace.

4286,IV,Midway on high; or felt as a troubled pool;
4287,IV,"Or as a broken sleep that hunts a dream half lost,"
4288,IV,Arrested and rebuked by the common school
4289,IV,Of daily things for truancy.  She could rejoice

4291,IV,"Her crowned possessor, and, on every sense"

4299,IV,Scarce felt she that she bled when battle scored
4300,IV,On riddled flags the further conjured line;
4301,IV,From off the meteor gleam of his waved sword
4302,IV,Reflected bright in permanence: she bled
4303,IV,As the Bacchante spills her challengeing wine
4304,IV,With whirl o’ the cup before the kiss to lip;
4305,IV,"And bade drudge History in his footprints tread,"
4306,IV,For pride of sword-strokes o’er slow penmanship:

4339,VI,But whom those errant moans accused
4340,VI,"As Liberty’s murderous mother, cried accursed,"
4341,VI,France blew to deafness: for a space she mused;
4342,VI,"She smoothed a startled look, and sought,"
4343,VI,"From treasuries of the adoring slave,"
4344,VI,Her surest way to strangle thought;
4345,VI,Picturing her dread lord decree advance
4346,VI,"Into the enemy’s land; artillery, bayonet, lance;"
4347,VI,His ordering fingers point the dial’s to time their ranks:
4348,VI,"Himself the black storm-cloud, the tempest’s bayonet-glaive."
4349,VI,"Like foam-heads of a loosened freshet bursting banks,"
4350,VI,By mount and fort they thread to swamp the sluggard plains.
4351,VI,"Shines his gold-laurel sun, or cloak connivent rains."
4352,VI,They press to where the hosts in line and square throng mute;
4353,VI,"He watchful of their form, the Audacious, the Astute;"
4354,VI,"Eagle to grip the field; to work his craftiest, fox."
4355,VI,"From his brief signal, straight the stroke of the leveller falls;"
4356,VI,"From him those opal puffs, those arcs with the clouded balls:"
4357,VI,He waves and the voluble scene is a quagmire shifting blocks;
4358,VI,"They clash, they are knotted, and now ’tis the deed of the axe on the"
4359,VI,log;
4360,VI,"Here away moves a spiky woodland, and yon away sweep"
4361,VI,"Rivers of horse torrent-mad to the shock, and the heap over heap"
4362,VI,"Right through the troughed black lines turned to bunches or shreds, or"
4363,VI,a fog
4364,VI,"Rolling off sunlight’s arrows.  Not mightier Phoebus in ire,"
4365,VI,"Nor deadlier Jove’s avengeing right hand, than he of the brain"
4366,VI,"Keen at an enemy’s mind to encircle and pierce and constrain,"
4367,VI,Muffling his own for a fate-charged blow very Gods may admire.
4368,VI,Sure to behold are his eagles on high where the conflict raged.
4369,VI,"Rightly, then, should France worship, and deafen the disaccord"
4370,VI,Of those who dare withstand an irresistible sword
4371,VI,To thwart his predestined subjection of Europe.  Let them submit!
4372,VI,"She said it aloud, and heard in her breast, as a singer caged,"
4373,VI,"With the beat of wings at bars, Earth’s fluttering little lyre."
4374,VI,"No more at midway heaven, but liker midway to the pit:"
4375,VI,"Not singing the spirally upward of rapture, the downward of pain"
4376,VI,"Rather, the drop sheer downward from pressure of merciless weight."
4377,VI,
4378,VI,"Her strangled thought got breath, with her worship held debate;"
4379,VI,"To yield and sink, yet eye askant the mark she had missed."
4380,VI,"Over the black-blue rollers of that broad Westerly main,"
4381,VI,"Steady to sky, the light of Liberty glowed"
4382,VI,"In a flaming pillar, that cast on the troubled waters a road"
4383,VI,"For Europe to cross, and see the thing lost subsist."
4384,VI,"For there ’twas a shepherd led his people, no butcher of sheep;"
4385,VI,Firmly there the banner he first upreared
4386,VI,Stands to rally; and nourishing grain do his children reap
4387,VI,"From a father beloved in life, in his death revered."
4388,VI,"Contemplating him and his work, shall a skyward glance"
4389,VI,Clearer sight of our dreamed and abandoned obtain;
4390,VI,"Nay, but as if seen in station above the Republic, France"
4391,VI,Had view of her one-day’s heavenly lover again;
4392,VI,"Saw him amid the bright host looking down on her; knew she had erred,"
4393,VI,"Knew him her judge, knew yonder the spirit preferred;"
4394,VI,"Yonder the base of the summit she strove that day to ascend,"
4395,VI,"Ere cannon mastered her soul, and all dreams had end."
4396,VI,
4397,VI,
4398,VII,VII
4399,VII,
4400,VII,
4401,VII,Soon felt she in her shivered frame
4402,VII,A bodeful drain of blood illume
4403,VII,Her wits with frosty fire to read
4404,VII,The dazzling wizard who would have her bleed
4405,VII,On fruitless marsh and snows of spectral gloom
4406,VII,For victory that was victory scarce in name.
4407,VII,"Husky his clarions laboured, and her sighs"
4408,VII,O’er slaughtered sons were heavier than the prize;
4409,VII,"Recalling how he stood by Frederic’s tomb,"
4410,VII,With Frederic’s country underfoot and spurned:
4411,VII,"There meditated; till her hope might guess,"
4412,VII,"Albeit his constant star prescribe success,"
4413,VII,"The savage strife would sink, the civil aim"
4414,VII,To head a mannered world breathe zephyrous
4415,VII,Of morning after storm; whereunto she yearned;
4416,VII,"And Labour’s lovely peace, and Beauty’s courtly bloom,"
4417,VII,The mind in strenuous tasks hilarious.
4418,VII,"At such great height, where hero hero topped,"
4419,VII,Right sanely should the Grand Ascendant think
4420,VII,No further leaps at the fanged abyss’s brink
4421,VII,True Genius takes: be battle’s dice-box dropped!
4422,VII,
4423,VII,"She watched his desert features, hung to hear"
4424,VII,"The honey words desired, and veiled her face;"
4425,VII,Hearing the Seaman’s name recur
4426,VII,"Wrathfully, thick with a meaning worse"
4427,VII,Than call to the march: for that inveterate Purse
4428,VII,"Could kindle the extinct, inform a vacant place,"
4429,VII,Conjure a heart into the trebly felled.
4430,VII,"It squeezed the globe, insufferably swelled"
4431,VII,To feed insurgent Europe: rear and van
4432,VII,Were haunted by the amphibious curse;
4433,VII,"Here flesh, there phantom, livelier after rout:"
4434,VII,"The Seaman piping aye to the rightabout,"
4435,VII,"Distracted Europe’s Master, puffed remote"
4436,VII,"Those Indies of the swift Macedonian,"
4437,VII,"Whereon would Europe’s Master somewhiles doat,"
4438,VII,In dreamings on a docile universe
4439,VII,Beneath an immarcessible Charlemagne.
4440,VII,
4441,VII,"Nor marvel France should veil a seer’s face,"
4442,VII,And call on darkness as a blest retreat.
4443,VII,Magnanimously could her iron Emperor
4444,VII,Confront submission: hostile stirred to heat
4445,VII,"All his vast enginery, allowed no halt"
4446,VII,"Up withered avenues of waste-blood war,"
4447,VII,"To the pitiless red mounts of fire afume,"
4448,VII,As ’twere the world’s arteries opened!  Woe the race!
4449,VII,Ask wherefore Fortune’s vile caprice should balk
4450,VII,"His panther spring across the foaming salt,"
4451,VII,From martial sands to the cliffs of pallid chalk!
4452,VII,There is no answer: seed of black defeat
4453,VII,"She then did sow, and France nigh unto death foredoom."
4454,VII,See since that Seaman’s epicycle sprite
4455,VII,"Engirdle, lure and goad him to the chase"
4456,VII,Along drear leagues of crimson spotting white
4457,VII,"With mother’s tears of France, that he may meet"
4458,VII,"Behind suborned battalions, ranked as wheat"
4459,VII,"Where peeps the weedy poppy, him of the sea;"
4460,VII,Earth’s power to baffle Ocean’s power resume;
4461,VII,Victorious army crown o’er Victory’s fleet;
4462,VII,"And bearing low that Seaman upon knee,"
4463,VII,"Stay the vexed question of supremacy,"
4464,VII,Obnoxious in the vault by Frederic’s tomb.
4465,VII,

4468,VIII,
4469,VIII,
4470,VIII,Poured streams of Europe’s veins the flood
4471,VIII,Full Rhine or Danube rolls off morning-tide
4472,VIII,Through shadowed reaches into crimson-dyed:
4473,VIII,And Rhine and Danube knew her gush of blood
4474,VIII,Down the plucked roots the deepest in her breast.
4475,VIII,"He tossed her cordials, from his laurels pressed."
4476,VIII,"She drank for dryness thirstily, praised his gifts."
4477,VIII,The blooded frame a powerful draught uplifts
4478,VIII,Writhed the devotedness her voice rang wide
4479,VIII,"In cries ecstatic, as of the martyr-Blest,"
4480,VIII,"Their spirits issuing forth of bodies racked,"
4481,VIII,"And crazy chuckles, with life’s tears at feud;"
4482,VIII,While near her heart the sunken sentinel
4483,VIII,"Called Critic marked, and dumb in awe reviewed"
4484,VIII,"This torture, this anointed, this untracked"
4485,VIII,"To mortal source, this alien of his kind;"
4486,VIII,"Creator, slayer, conjuror, Solon-Mars,"
4487,VIII,"The cataract of the abyss, the star of stars;"
4488,VIII,Whose arts to lay the senses under spell
4489,VIII,Aroused an insurrectionary mind.
4490,VIII,
4491,VIII,
4492,IX,IX
4493,IX,
4494,IX,
4495,IX,"He, did he love her?  France was his weapon, shrewd"
4496,IX,"At edge, a wind in onset: he loved well"
4497,IX,"His tempered weapon, with the which he hewed"
4498,IX,"Clean to the ground impediments, or hacked,"
4499,IX,Sure of the blade that served the great man-miracle.
4500,IX,"He raised her, robed her, gemmed her for his bride,"
4501,IX,Did but her blood in blindness given exact.
4502,IX,"Her blood she gave, was blind to him as guide:"
4503,IX,"She quivered at his word, and at his touch"
4504,IX,Was hound or steed for any mark he espied.
4505,IX,"He loved her more than little, less than much."
4506,IX,The fair subservient of Imperial Fact
4507,IX,Next to his consanguineous was placed
4508,IX,"In ranked esteem; above the diurnal meal,"
4509,IX,"Vexatious carnal appetites above,"
4510,IX,"Above his hoards, while she Imperial Fact embraced,"
4511,IX,And rose but at command from under heel.
4512,IX,"The love devolvent, the ascension love,"
4513,IX,"Receptive or profuse, were fires he lacked,"
4514,IX,Whose marrow had expelled their wasteful sparks;
4515,IX,"Whose mind, the vast machine of endless haste,"
4516,IX,Took up but solids for its glowing seal.
4517,IX,"The hungry love, that fish-like creatures feel,"
4518,IX,"Impelled for prize of hooks, for prey of sharks,"
4519,IX,"His night’s first quarter sicklied to distaste,"
4520,IX,In warm enjoyment barely might distract.
4521,IX,A head that held an Europe half devoured
4522,IX,Taste in the blood’s conceit of pleasure soured.
4523,IX,"Nought save his rounding aim, the means he plied,"
4524,IX,"Death for his cause, to him could point appeal."
4525,IX,His mistress was the thing of uses tried.
4526,IX,"Frigid the netting smile on whom he wooed,"
4527,IX,But on his Policy his eye was lewd.
4528,IX,That sharp long zig-zag into distance brooked
4529,IX,No foot across; a shade his ire provoked.
4530,IX,The blunder or the cruelty of a deed
4531,IX,His Policy imperative could plead.
4532,IX,"He deemed nought other precious, nor knew he"
4533,IX,Legitimate outside his Policy.
4534,IX,"Men’s lives and works were due, from their birth’s date,"
4535,IX,"To the State’s shield and sword, himself the State."
4536,IX,"He thought for them in mass, as Titan may;"
4537,IX,For their pronounced well-being bade obey;
4538,IX,"O’er each obstructive thicket thunderclapped,"
4539,IX,And straight their easy road to market mapped.
4540,IX,Watched Argus to survey the huge preserves
4541,IX,He held or coveted; Mars was armed alert
4542,IX,"At sign of motion; yet his brows were murk,"
4543,IX,"His gorge would surge, to see the butcher’s work,"
4544,IX,The Reaper’s field; a sensitive in nerves.
4545,IX,He rode not over men to do them hurt.
4546,IX,As one who claimed to have for paramour
4547,IX,"Earth’s fairest form, he dealt the cancelling blow;"
4548,IX,"Impassioned, still impersonal; to ensure"
4549,IX,"Possession; free of rivals, not their foe."
4550,IX,
4551,IX,"The common Tyrant’s frenzies, rancour, spites,"
4552,IX,He knew as little as men’s claim on rights.
4553,IX,"A kindness for old servants, early friends,"
4554,IX,Was constant in him while they served his ends;
4555,IX,"And if irascible, ’twas the moment’s reek"
4556,IX,From fires diverted by some gusty freak.
4557,IX,His Policy the act which breeds the act
4558,IX,"Prevised, in issues accurately summed"
4559,IX,"From reckonings of men’s tempers, terrors, needs:—"
4560,IX,"That universal army, which he leads"
4561,IX,Who builds Imperial on Imperious Fact.
4562,IX,Within his hot brain’s hammering workshop hummed
4563,IX,"A thousand furious wheels at whirr, untired"
4564,IX,As Nature in her reproductive throes;
4565,IX,"And did they grate, he spake, and cannon fired:"
4566,IX,The cause being aye the incendiary foes
4567,IX,Proved by prostration culpable.  His dispense
4568,IX,Of Justice made his active conscience;
4569,IX,His passive was of ceaseless labour formed.
4570,IX,So found this Tyrant sanction and repose;
4571,IX,"Humanly just, inhumanly unwarmed."
4572,IX,Preventive fencings with the foul intent
4573,IX,"Occult, by him observed and foiled betimes,"
4574,IX,Let fool historians chronicle as crimes.
4575,IX,His blows were dealt to clear the way he went:
4576,IX,Too busy sword and mind for needless blows.
4577,IX,The mighty bird of sky minutest grains
4578,IX,On ground perceived; in heaven but rays or rains;
4579,IX,"In humankind diversities of masks,"
4580,IX,For rule of men the choice of bait or goads.
4581,IX,The statesman steered the despot to large tasks;
4582,IX,The despot drove the statesman on short roads.
4583,IX,"For Order’s cause he laboured, as inclined"
4584,IX,A soldier’s training and his Euclid mind.
4585,IX,His army unto men he could present
4586,IX,As model of the perfect instrument.
4587,IX,"That creature, woman, was the sofa soft,"
4588,IX,"When warriors their dusty armour doffed,"
4589,IX,And read their manuals for the making truce
4590,IX,With rosy frailties framed to reproduce.
4591,IX,"He farmed his land, distillingly alive"
4592,IX,"For the utmost extract he might have and hive,"
4593,IX,"Wherewith to marshal force; and in like scheme,"
4594,IX,Benign shone Hymen’s torch on young love’s dream.
4595,IX,Thus to be strong was he beneficent;
4596,IX,"A fount of earth, likewise a firmament."
4597,IX,
4598,IX,The disputant in words his eye dismayed:
4599,IX,Opinions blocked his passage.  Rent
4600,IX,Were Councils with a gesture; brayed
4601,IX,By hoarse camp-phrase what argument
4602,IX,Dared interpose to waken spleen
4603,IX,"In him whose vision grasped the unseen,"
4604,IX,"Whose counsellor was the ready blade,"
4605,IX,Whose argument the cannonade.
4606,IX,"He loathed his land’s divergent parties, loth"
4607,IX,"To grant them speech, they were such idle troops;"
4608,IX,"The friable and the grumous, dizzards both."
4609,IX,Men were good sticks his mastery wrought from hoops;
4610,IX,"Some serviceable, none credible on oath."
4611,IX,The silly preference they nursed to die
4612,IX,"In beds he scorned, and led where they should lie."
4613,IX,"If magic made them pliable for his use,"
4614,IX,Magician he could be by planned surprise.
4615,IX,"For do they see the deuce in human guise,"
4616,IX,"As men’s acknowledged head appears the deuce,"
4617,IX,And they will toil with devilish craft and zeal.
4618,IX,Among them certain vagrant wits that had
4619,IX,Ideas buzzed; they were the feebly mad;
4620,IX,Pursuers of a film they hailed ideal;
4621,IX,But could be dangerous fire-flies for a brain
4622,IX,"Subdued by fact, still amorous of the inane."
4623,IX,"With a breath he blew them out, to beat their wings"
4624,IX,"The way of such transfeminated things,"
4625,IX,And France had sense of vacancy in Light.
4626,IX,
4627,IX,"That is the soul’s dead darkness, making clutch"
4628,IX,Wild hands for aid at muscles within touch;
4629,IX,Adding to slavery’s chain the stringent twist;
4630,IX,Even when it brings close surety that aright
4631,IX,She reads her Tyrant through his golden mist;
4632,IX,Perceives him fast to a harsher Tyrant bound;
4633,IX,"Self-ridden, self-hunted, captive of his aim;"
4634,IX,"Material grandeur’s ape, the Infernal’s hound;"
4635,IX,"Enormous, with no infinite around;"
4636,IX,"No starred deep sky, no Muse, or lame"
4637,IX,"The dusty pattering pinions,"
4638,IX,The voice as through the brazen tube of Fame.
4639,IX,
4640,IX,
4641,X,X
4642,X,
4643,X,
4644,X,"Hugest of engines, a much limited man,"
4645,X,"She saw the Lustrous, her great lord, appear"
4646,X,Through that smoked glass her last privation brought
4647,X,To point her critic eye and spur her thought:
4648,X,A heart but to propel Leviathan;
4649,X,A spirit that breathed but in earth’s atmosphere.
4650,X,Amid the plumed and sceptred ones
4651,X,"Irradiatingly Jovian,"
4652,X,The mountain tower capped by the floating cloud;
4653,X,A nursery screamer where dialectics ruled:
4654,X,"Mannerless, graceless, laughterless, unlike"
4655,X,"Herself in all, yet with such power to strike,"
4656,X,That she the various features she could scan
4657,X,"Dared not to sum, though seeing: and befooled"
4658,X,"By power which beamed omnipotent, she bowed,"
4659,X,Subservient as roused echo round his guns.
4660,X,"Invulnerable Prince of Myrmidons,"
4661,X,"He sparkled, by no sage Athene schooled."
4662,X,"Partly she read her riddle, stricken and pained;"
4663,X,"But irony, her spirit’s tongue, restrained."
4664,X,"The Critic, last of vital in the proud"
4665,X,"Enslaved, when most detectively endowed,"
4666,X,"Admired how irony’s venom off him ran,"
4667,X,Like rain-drops down a statue cast in bronze:
4668,X,"Whereby of her keen rapier disarmed,"
4669,X,"Again her chant of eulogy began,"
4670,X,"Protesting, but with slavish senses charmed."
4671,X,
4672,X,"Her warrior, chief among the valorous great"
4673,X,"In arms he was, dispelling shades of blame,"
4674,X,With radiance palpable in fruit and weight.
4675,X,"Heard she reproach, his victories blared response;"
4676,X,"His victories bent the Critic to acclaim,"
4677,X,As with fresh blows upon a ringing sconce.
4678,X,Or heard she from scarred ranks of jolly growls
4679,X,"His veterans dwarf their reverence and, like owls,"
4680,X,"Laugh in the pitch of discord, to exalt"
4681,X,"Their idol for some genial trick or fault,"
4682,X,"She, too, became his marching veteran."
4683,X,Again she took her breath from them who bore
4684,X,"His eagles through the tawny roar,"
4685,X,"And murmured at a peaceful state,"
4686,X,"That bred the title charlatan,"
4687,X,"As missile from the mouth of hate,"
4688,X,"For one the daemon fierily filled and hurled,"
4689,X,"Cannon his name,"
4690,X,Shattering against a barrier world;
4691,X,Her supreme player of man’s primaeval game.
4692,X,
4693,X,"The daemon filled him, and he filled her sons;"
4694,X,"Strung them to stature over human height,"
4695,X,As march the standards down the smoky fight;
4696,X,"Her cherubim, her towering mastodons!"
4697,X,"Directed vault or breach, break through"
4698,X,"Earth’s toughest, seasons, elements, tame;"
4699,X,Dash at the bulk the sharpened few;
4700,X,Count death the smallest of their debts:
4701,X,Show that the will to do
4702,X,Is masculine and begets!
4703,X,
4704,X,These princes unto him the mother owed;
4705,X,These jewels of manhood that rich hand bestowed.
4706,X,"What wonder, though with wits awake"
4707,X,"To read her riddle, for these her offspring’s sake;—"
4708,X,"And she, before high heaven adulteress,"
4709,X,"The lost to honour, in his glory clothed,"
4710,X,"Else naked, shamed in sight of men, self-loathed;—"
4711,X,"That she should quench her thought, nor worship less"
4712,X,Than ere she bled on sands or snows and knew
4713,X,"The slave’s alternative, to worship or to rue!"
4714,X,
4715,X,
4716,XI,XI
4717,XI,
4718,XI,
4719,XI,"Bright from the shell of that much limited man,"
4720,XI,"Her hero, like the falchion out of sheath,"
4721,XI,"Like soul that quits the tumbled body, soared:"
4722,XI,"And France, impulsive, nuptial with his plan,"
4723,XI,"Albeit the Critic fretting her, adored"
4724,XI,"Once more.  Exultingly her heart went forth,"
4725,XI,"Submissive to his mind and mood,"
4726,XI,The way of those pent-eyebrows North;
4727,XI,For now was he to win the wreath
4728,XI,Surpassing sunniest in camp or Court;
4729,XI,"Next, as the blessed harvest after years of blight,"
4730,XI,"Sit, the Great Emperor, to be known the Good!"
4731,XI,
4732,XI,"Now had the Seaman’s volvent sprite,"
4733,XI,"Lean from the chase that barked his contraband,"
4734,XI,"A beggared applicant at every port,"
4735,XI,"To strew the profitless deeps and rot beneath,"
4736,XI,"Slung northward, for a hunted beast’s retort"
4737,XI,"On sovereign power; there his final stand,"
4738,XI,"Among the perjured Scythian’s shaggy horde,"
4739,XI,The hydrocephalic aërolite
4740,XI,"Had taken; flashing thence repellent teeth,"
4741,XI,Though Europe’s Master Europe’s Rebel banned
4742,XI,"To be earth’s outcast, ocean’s lord and sport."
4743,XI,
4744,XI,Unmoved might seem the Master’s taunted sword.
4745,XI,"Northward his dusky legions nightly slipped,"
4746,XI,As on the map of that all-provident head;
4747,XI,"He luting Peace the while, like morning’s cock"
4748,XI,The quiet day to round the hours for bed;
4749,XI,No pastoral shepherd sweeter to his flock.
4750,XI,Then Europe first beheld her Titan stripped.
4751,XI,"To what vast length of limb and mounds of thews,"
4752,XI,"How trained to scale the eminences, pluck"
4753,XI,"The hazards for new footing, how compel"
4754,XI,"Those timely incidents by men named luck,"
4755,XI,"Through forethought that defied the Fates to choose,"
4756,XI,Her grovelling admiration had not yet
4757,XI,Imagined of the great man-miracle;
4758,XI,And France recounted with her comic smile
4759,XI,"Duplicities of Court and Cabinet,"
4760,XI,"The silky female of his male in guile,"
4761,XI,Wherewith her two-faced Master could amuse
4762,XI,"A dupe he charmed in sunny beams to bask,"
4763,XI,Before his feint for camisado struck
4764,XI,The lightning moment of the cast-off mask.
4765,XI,
4766,XI,Splendours of earth repeating heaven’s at set
4767,XI,Of sun down mountain cloud in masses arched;
4768,XI,"Since Asia upon Europe marched,"
4769,XI,Unmatched the copious multitudes; unknown
4770,XI,"To Gallia’s over-runner, Rome’s inveterate foe,"
4771,XI,"Such hosts; all one machine for overthrow,"
4772,XI,"Coruscant from the Master’s hand, compact"
4773,XI,As reasoned thoughts in the Master’s head; were shown
4774,XI,Yon lightning moment when his acme might
4775,XI,Blazed o’er the stream that cuts the sandy tract
4776,XI,Borussian from Sarmatia’s famished flat;
4777,XI,"The century’s flower; and off its pinnacled throne,"
4778,XI,Rayed servitude on Europe’s ball of sight.
4779,XI,

4781,XII,XII
4782,XII,
4783,XII,
4784,XII,Behind the Northern curtain-folds he passed.
4785,XII,There heard hushed France her muffled heart beat fast
4786,XII,"Against the hollow ear-drum, where she sat"
4787,XII,"In expectation’s darkness, until cracked"
4788,XII,The straining curtain-seams: a scaly light
4789,XII,Was ghost above an army under shroud.
4790,XII,Imperious on Imperial Fact
4791,XII,Incestuously the incredible begat.
4792,XII,"His veterans and auxiliaries,"
4793,XII,"The trained, the trustful, sanguine, proud,"
4794,XII,"Princely, scarce numerable to recite,—"
4795,XII,Titanic of all Titan tragedies!—
4796,XII,"That Northern curtain took them, as the seas"
4797,XII,Gulp the great ships to give back shipmen white.
4798,XII,
4799,XII,"Alive in marble, she conceived in soul,"
4800,XII,"With barren eyes and mouth, the mother’s loss;"
4801,XII,The bolt from her abandoned heaven sped;
4802,XII,The snowy army rolling knoll on knoll
4803,XII,"Beyond horizon, under no blest Cross:"
4804,XII,By the vulture dotted and engarlanded.
4805,XII,
4806,XII,Was it a necromancer lured
4807,XII,To weave his tense betraying spell?
4808,XII,A Titan whom our God endured
4809,XII,"Till he of his foul hungers fell,"
4810,XII,By all his craft and labour scourged?
4811,XII,"A deluge Europe’s liberated wave,"
4812,XII,"Pæan to sky, leapt over that vast grave."
4813,XII,Its shadow-points against her sacred land converged.
4814,XII,"And him, her yoke-fellow, her black lord, her fate,"
4815,XII,"In doubt, in fevered hope, in chills of hate,"
4816,XII,"That tore her old credulity to strips,"
4817,XII,"Then pressed the auspicious relics on her lips,"
4818,XII,His withered slave for foregone miracles urged.
4819,XII,"And he, whom now his ominous halo’s round,"
4820,XII,"A three parts blank decrescent sickle, crowned,"
4821,XII,"Prodigious in catastrophe, could wear"
4822,XII,The realm of Darkness with its Prince’s air;
4823,XII,Assume in mien the resolute pretence
4824,XII,"To satiate an hungered confidence,"
4825,XII,Proved criminal by the sceptic seen to cower
4826,XII,Beside the generous face of that frail flower.
4827,XII,
4828,XII,
4829,XIII,XIII
4830,XIII,
4831,XIII,
4832,XIII,Desire and terror then had each of each:
4833,XIII,His crown and sword were staked on the magic stroke;
4834,XIII,Her blood she gave as one who loved her leech;
4835,XIII,And both did barter under union’s cloak.
4836,XIII,An union in hot fever and fierce need
4837,XIII,"Of either’s aid, distrust in trust did breed."
4838,XIII,Their traffic instincts hooded their live wits
4839,XIII,To issues.  Never human fortune throve
4840,XIII,"On such alliance.  Viewed by fits,"
4841,XIII,From Vulcan’s forge a hovering Jove
4842,XIII,Evolved.  The slave he dragged the Tyrant drove.
4843,XIII,Her awe of him his dread of her invoked:
4844,XIII,His nature with her shivering faith ran yoked.
4845,XIII,"What wisdom counselled, Policy declined;"
4846,XIII,All perils dared he save the step behind.
4847,XIII,Ahead his grand initiative becked:
4848,XIII,"One spark of radiance blurred, his orb was wrecked."
4849,XIII,"Stripped to the despot upstart, for success"
4850,XIII,He raged to clothe a perilous nakedness.
4851,XIII,"He would not fall, while falling; would not be taught,"
4852,XIII,While learning; would not relax his grasp on aught
4853,XIII,"He held in hand, while losing it; pressed advance,"
4854,XIII,Pricked for her lees the veins of wasted France;
4855,XIII,"Who, had he stayed to husband her, had spun"
4856,XIII,"The strength he taxed unripened for his throw,"
4857,XIII,"In vengeful casts calamitous,"
4858,XIII,"On fields where palsying Pyrrhic laurels grow,"
4859,XIII,The luminous the ruinous.
4860,XIII,"An incalescent scorpion,"
4861,XIII,And fierier for the mounded cirque
4862,XIII,"That narrowed at him thick and murk,"
4863,XIII,This gambler with his genius
4864,XIII,"Flung lives in angry volleys, bloody lightnings, flung"
4865,XIII,"His fortunes to the hosts he stung,"
4866,XIII,With victories clipped his eagle’s wings.
4867,XIII,By the hands that built him up was he undone:
4868,XIII,"By the star aloft, which was his ram’s-head will"
4869,XIII,Within; by the toppling throne the soldier won;
4870,XIII,"By the yeasty ferment of what once had been,"
4871,XIII,To cloud a rational mind for present things;
4872,XIII,"By his own force, the suicide in his mill."
4873,XIII,Needs never God of Vengeance intervene
4874,XIII,When giants their last lesson have to learn.
4875,XIII,"Fighting against an end he could discern,"
4876,XIII,The chivalry whereof he had none
4877,XIII,He called from his worn slave’s abundant springs:
4878,XIII,Not deigning spousally entreat
4879,XIII,"That ever blinded by his martial skill,"
4880,XIII,But harsh to have her worship counted out
4881,XIII,"In human coin, her vital rivers drained,"
4882,XIII,"Her infant forests felled, commanded die"
4883,XIII,"The decade thousand deaths for his Imperial seat,"
4884,XIII,Where throning he her faith in him maintained;
4885,XIII,Bound Reason to believe delayed defeat
4886,XIII,Was triumph; and what strength in her remained
4887,XIII,"To head against the ultimate foreseen rout,"
4888,XIII,"Insensate taxed; of his impenitent will,"
4889,XIII,"Servant and sycophant: without ally,"
4890,XIII,"In Python’s coils, the Master Craftsman still;"
4891,XIII,"The smiter, panther springer, trapper sly,"
4892,XIII,"The deadly wrestler at the crucial bout,"
4893,XIII,"The penetrant, the tonant, tower of towers,"
4894,XIII,Striking from black disaster starry showers.
4895,XIII,"Her supreme player of man’s primaeval game,"
4896,XIII,"He won his harnessed victim’s rapturous shout,"
4897,XIII,"When every move was mortal to her frame,"
4898,XIII,"Her prayer to life that stricken he might lie,"
4899,XIII,She to exchange his laurels for earth’s flowers.
4900,XIII,
4901,XIII,"The innumerable whelmed him, and he fell:"
4902,XIII,A vessel in mid-ocean under storm.
4903,XIII,"Ere ceased the lullaby of his passing bell,"
4904,XIII,"He sprang to sight, in human form"
4905,XIII,"Revealed, from no celestial aids:"
4906,XIII,"The shades enclosed him, and he fired the shades."
4907,XIII,
4908,XIII,"Cannon his name,"
4909,XIII,"Cannon his voice, he came."
4910,XIII,"The fount of miracles from drought-dust arose,"
4911,XIII,"Amazing even on his Imperial stage,"
4912,XIII,Where marvels lightened through the alternate hours
4913,XIII,And winged o’er human earth’s heroical shone.
4914,XIII,"Into the press of cumulative foes,"
4915,XIII,"Across the friendly fields of smoke and rage,"
4916,XIII,A broken structure bore his furious powers;
4917,XIII,"The man no more, the Warrior Chief the same;"
4918,XIII,Match for all rivals; in himself but flame
4919,XIII,"Of an outworn lamp, to illumine nought anon."
4920,XIII,Yet loud as when he first showed War’s effete
4921,XIII,"Their Schoolman off his eagre mounted high,"
4922,XIII,"And summoned to subject who dared compete,"
4923,XIII,The cannon in the name Napoleon
4924,XIII,Discoursed of sulphur earth to curtained sky.
4925,XIII,"So through a tropic day a regnant sun,"
4926,XIII,"Where armies of assailant vapours thronged,"
4927,XIII,"His glory’s trappings laid on them: comes night,"
4928,XIII,Enwraps him in a bosom quick of heat
4929,XIII,"From his anterior splendours, and shall seem"
4930,XIII,"Day instant, Day’s own lord in the furnace gleam,"
4931,XIII,"The virulent quiver on ravished eyes prolonged,"
4932,XIII,"When severed darkness, all flaminical bright,"
4933,XIII,Slips vivid eagles linked in rapid flight;
4934,XIII,"Which bring at whiles the lionly far roar,"
4935,XIII,"As wrestled he with manacles and gags,"
4936,XIII,"To speed across a cowering world once more,"
4937,XIII,"Superb in ordered floods, his lordly flags."
4938,XIII,"His name on silence thundered, on the obscure"
4939,XIII,Lightened; it haunted morn and even-song:
4940,XIII,"Earth of her prodigy’s extinction long,"
4941,XIII,"With shudderings and with thrillings, hung unsure."
4942,XIII,
4943,XIII,"Snapped was the chord that made the resonant bow,"
4944,XIII,"In France, abased and like a shrunken corse;"
4945,XIII,"Amid the weakest weak, the lowest low,"
4946,XIII,"From the highest fallen, stagnant off her source;"
4947,XIII,Condemned to hear the nations’ hostile mirth;
4948,XIII,"See curtained heavens, and smell a sulphurous earth;"
4949,XIII,Which told how evermore shall tyrant Force
4950,XIII,Beget the greater for its overthrow.
4951,XIII,The song of Liberty in her hearing spoke
4952,XIII,A foreign tongue; Earth’s fluttering little lyre
4953,XIII,"Unlike, but like the raven’s ravening croak."
4954,XIII,Not till her breath of being could aspire
4955,XIII,"Anew, this loved and scourged of Angels found"
4956,XIII,Our common brotherhood in sight and sound:
4957,XIII,"When mellow rang the name Napoleon,"
4958,XIII,And dim aloft her young Angelical waved.
4959,XIII,"Between ethereal and gross to choose,"
4960,XIII,"She swung; her soul desired, her senses craved."
4961,XIII,"They pricked her dreams, while oft her skies were dun"
4962,XIII,Behind o’ershadowing foemen: on a tide
4963,XIII,They drew the nature having need of pride
4964,XIII,Among her fellows for its vital dues:
4965,XIII,"He seen like some rare treasure-galleon,"
4966,XIII,"Hull down, with masts against the Western hues."

4979,I,"An orb of nations, radiating food"
4980,I,For body and for mind alway.
4981,I,Where is the Shape of glad array;
4982,I,"The nervous hands, the front of steel,"
4983,I,The clarion tongue?  Where is the bold proud face?

4994,II,Which was as lightning to reveal
4995,II,"New seasons, with the swifter play"
4996,II,"Of pulses, and benigner day;"
4997,II,She that divinely shook the dead
4998,II,From living man; that stretched ahead
4999,II,"Her resolute forefinger straight,"
5000,II,And marched toward the gloomy gate
5001,II,"Of earth’s Untried, gave note, and in"
5002,II,The good name of Humanity
5003,II,"Called forth the daring vision! she,"
5004,II,"She likewise half corrupt of sin,"
5005,II,Angel and Wanton! can it be?
5006,II,"Her star has foundered in eclipse,"
5007,II,The shriek of madness on her lips;

5021,III,"Still thrilling like a lyre,"
5022,III,Amazed to shivering discord from a fall
5023,III,Sudden as that the lurid hosts recall
5024,III,Who met in heaven the irreparable mischance.
5025,III,O that is France!
5026,III,"The brilliant eyes to kindle bliss,"
5027,III,"The shrewd quick lips to laugh and kiss,"

5039,IV,"Mother of Pride, her sanctuary shamed:"
5040,IV,"Mother of Delicacy, and made a mark"

5046,IV,"Mother of Honour, and dishonoured: Mother"
5047,IV,"Of Glory, she condemned to crown with bays"

5052,IV,"Like grass, her young ones!  Yea, in the low groan"
5053,IV,And under the fixed thunder of this hour

5088,V,And of their terrors and humiliations
5089,V,Wove her the starry wreath that earthward lowers
5090,V,Now in the figure of a burning yoke!
5091,V,"Her legions traversed North and South and East,"
5092,V,Of triumph they enjoyed the glutton’s feast:
5093,V,"They grafted the green sprig, they lopped the oak."
5094,V,"They caught by the beard the tempests, by the scalp"
5095,V,"The icy precipices, and clove sheer through"
5096,V,"The heart of horror of the pinnacled Alp,"
5097,V,Emerging not as men whom mortals knew.
5098,V,"They were the earthquake and the hurricane,"
5099,V,"The lightnings and the locusts, plagues of blight,"
5100,V,"Plagues of the revel: they were Deluge rain,"
5101,V,And dreaded Conflagration; lawless Might.

5103,V,"Where under frozen mists they may be tracked,"
5104,V,"Who men and elements provoked to foes,"

5106,V,"Abhorred of all.  Yet, how they sucked the teats"
5107,V,"Of Carnage, thirsty issue of their dam,"
5108,V,"Whose eagles, angrier than their oriflamme,"

5112,V,Forgetful is green earth; the Gods alone
5113,V,Remember everlastingly: they strike
5114,V,"Remorselessly, and ever like for like."

5124,VI,That once the sweetest and the proudest shone;
5125,VI,Scoring for hideous dismemberment
5126,VI,"Her limbs, as were the anguish-taking breath"
5127,VI,Gone out of her in the insufferable descent
5128,VI,"From her high chieftainship; as were she death,"
5129,VI,"Who hears a voice of justice, feels the knife"
5130,VI,"Of torture, drinks all ignominy of life."
5131,VI,"They are with her, and the painful Gods might weep,"
5132,VI,If ever rain of tears came out of heaven
5133,VI,"To flatter Weakness and bid conscience sleep,"
5134,VI,"Viewing the woe of this Immortal, driven"
5135,VI,For the soul’s life to drain the maddening cup
5136,VI,Of her own children’s blood implacably:
5137,VI,Unsparing even as they to furrow up
5138,VI,The yellow land to likeness of a sea:
5139,VI,"The bountiful fair land of vine and grain,"
5140,VI,"Of wit and grace and ardour, and strong roots,"
5141,VI,"Fruits perishable, imperishable fruits;"
5142,VI,Furrowed to likeness of the dim grey main

5146,VII,VII
5147,VII,

5150,VII,Whom they abandon misery persecutes
5151,VII,No more: them half-eyed apathy may loan
5152,VII,The happiness of pitiable brutes.
5153,VII,"Whom the just Gods abandon have no light,"
5154,VII,No ruthless light of introspective eyes
5155,VII,That in the midst of misery scrutinize
5156,VII,The heart and its iniquities outright.
5157,VII,"They rest, they smile and rest; have earned perchance"
5158,VII,Of ancient service quiet for a term;
5159,VII,Quiet of old men dropping to the worm;
5160,VII,And so goes out the soul.  But not of France.
5161,VII,"She cries for grief, and to the Gods she cries,"
5162,VII,"For fearfully their loosened hands chastize,"
5163,VII,And icily they watch the rod’s caress
5164,VII,"Ravage her flesh from scourges merciless,"
5165,VII,"But she, inveterate of brain, discerns"
5166,VII,That Pity has as little place as Joy
5167,VII,Among their roll of gifts; for Strength she yearns.
5168,VII,"For Strength, her idol once, too long her toy."
5169,VII,"Lo, Strength is of the plain root-Virtues born:"
5170,VII,"Strength shall ye gain by service, prove in scorn,"
5171,VII,"Train by endurance, by devotion shape."
5172,VII,Strength is not won by miracle or rape.
5173,VII,"It is the offspring of the modest years,"
5174,VII,"The gift of sire to son, thro’ those firm laws"
5175,VII,"Which we name Gods; which are the righteous cause,"
5176,VII,"The cause of man, and manhood’s ministers."
5177,VII,"Could France accept the fables of her priests,"
5178,VII,"Who blest her banners in this game of beasts,"
5179,VII,And now bid hope that heaven will intercede
5180,VII,"To violate its laws in her sore need,"
5181,VII,She would find comfort in their opiates:
5182,VII,Mother of Reason! can she cheat the Fates?
5183,VII,"Would she, the champion of the open mind,"
5184,VII,The Omnipotent’s prime gift—the gift of growth—
5185,VII,"Consent even for a night-time to be blind,"
5186,VII,"And sink her soul on the delusive sloth,"
5187,VII,"For fruits ethereal and material, both,"
5188,VII,In peril of her place among mankind?
5189,VII,The Mother of the many Laughters might
5190,VII,Call one poor shade of laughter in the light
5191,VII,Of her unwavering lamp to mark what things
5192,VII,"The world puts faith in, careless of the truth:"
5193,VII,"What silly puppet-bodies danced on strings,"
5194,VII,"Attached by credence, we appear in sooth,"
5195,VII,"Demanding intercession, direct aid,"
5196,VII,When the whole tragic tale hangs on a broken blade!
5197,VII,
5198,VII,She swung the sword for centuries; in a day
5199,VII,"It slipped her, like a stream cut off from source."
5200,VII,"She struck a feeble hand, and tried to pray,"
5201,VII,"Clamoured of treachery, and had recourse"
5202,VII,To drunken outcries in her dream that Force
5203,VII,Needed but hear her shouting to obey.
5204,VII,Was she not formed to conquer?  The bright plumes
5205,VII,Of crested vanity shed graceful nods:
5206,VII,"Transcendent in her foundries, Arts and looms,"
5207,VII,Had France to fear the vengeance of the Gods?
5208,VII,Her faith was on her battle-roll of names
5209,VII,Sheathed in the records of old war; with dance
5210,VII,"And song she thrilled her warriors and her dames,"
5211,VII,Embracing her Dishonour: gave him France
5212,VII,"From head to foot, France present and to come,"
5213,VII,So she might hear the trumpet and the drum—
5214,VII,Bellona and Bacchante! rushing forth
5215,VII,On yon stout marching Schoolmen of the North.
5216,VII,
5217,VII,"Inveterate of brain, well knows she why"
5218,VII,"Strength failed her, faithful to himself the first:"
5219,VII,"Her dream is done, and she can read the sky,"
5220,VII,And she can take into her heart the worst
5221,VII,Calamity to drug the shameful thought
5222,VII,Of days that made her as the man she served
5223,VII,"A name of terror, but a thing unnerved:"
5224,VII,"Buying the trickster, by the trickster bought,"
5225,VII,"She for dominion, he to patch a throne."

5254,X,"The Man; for sacrifice unripe,"
5255,X,She too must fill a Vulture’s beak.
5256,X,"Deride the vanquished, and acclaim"
5257,X,"The conqueror, who stains her fame,"

5265,XI,She shall rise worthier of her prototype
5266,XI,Thro’ her abasement deep; the pain that runs
5267,XI,From nerve to nerve some victory achieves.
5268,XI,They lie like circle-strewn soaked Autumn-leaves
5269,XI,"Which stain the forest scarlet, her fair sons!"
5270,XI,And of their death her life is: of their blood
5271,XI,"From many streams now urging to a flood,"
5272,XI,"No more divided, France shall rise afresh."
5273,XI,Of them she learns the lesson of the flesh:—
5274,XI,"The lesson writ in red since first Time ran,"
5275,XI,A hunter hunting down the beast in man:
5276,XI,"That till the chasing out of its last vice,"
5277,XI,The flesh was fashioned but for sacrifice.
5278,XI,
5279,XI,Immortal Mother of a mortal host!
5280,XI,"Thou suffering of the wounds that will not slay,"
5281,XI,Wounds that bring death but take not life away!—
5282,XI,Stand fast and hearken while thy victors boast:
5283,XI,"Hearken, and loathe that music evermore."
5284,XI,Slip loose thy garments woven of pride and shame:
5285,XI,"The torture lurks in them, with them the blame"
5286,XI,Shall pass to leave thee purer than before.
5287,XI,"Undo thy jewels, thinking whence they came,"
5288,XI,"For what, and of the abominable name"
5289,XI,Of her who in imperial beauty wore.
5290,XI,
5291,XI,O Mother of a fated fleeting host
5292,XI,"Conceived in the past days of sin, and born"
5293,XI,"Heirs of disease and arrogance and scorn,"
5294,XI,"Surrender, yield the weight of thy great ghost,"
5295,XI,"Like wings on air, to what the heavens proclaim"
5296,XI,With trumpets from the multitudinous mounds
5297,XI,Where peace has filled the hearing of thy sons:
5298,XI,Albeit a pang of dissolution rounds
5299,XI,"Each new discernment of the undying ones,"
5300,XI,Do thou stoop to these graves here scattered wide
5301,XI,"Along thy fields, as sunless billows roll;"
5302,XI,These ashes have the lesson for the soul.
5303,XI,"‘Die to thy Vanity, and strain thy Pride,"
5304,XI,"Strip off thy Luxury: that thou may’st live,"
5305,XI,"Die to thyself,’ they say, ‘as we have died"
5306,XI,"From dear existence and the foe forgive,"
5307,XI,Nor pray for aught save in our little space
5308,XI,To warn good seed to greet the fair earth’s face.’
5309,XI,"O Mother! take their counsel, and so shall"
5310,XI,"The broader world breathe in on this thy home,"
5311,XI,"Light clear for thee the counter-changing dome,"
5312,XI,"Strength give thee, like an ocean’s vast expanse"
5313,XI,"Off mountain cliffs, the generations all,"
5314,XI,"Not whirling in their narrow rings of foam,"
5315,XI,But as a river forward.  Soaring France!
5316,XI,Now is Humanity on trial in thee:
5317,XI,Now may’st thou gather humankind in fee:
5318,XI,Now prove that Reason is a quenchless scroll;
5319,XI,"Make of calamity thine aureole,"
5320,XI,And bleeding head us thro’ the troubles of the sea.

5378,II,
5379,II,Voice of Earth’s very soul to the soul she would see renewed:

5382,II,"In sandy alleys of woodland silence, shedding to bare."
5383,II,"Daughters of Earth and men, they piped of her natural brood;"
5384,II,Her patient helpful four-feet; wings on the flit or in nest;
5385,II,Paws at our old-world task to scoop a defensive lair;
5386,II,Snouts at hunt through the scented grasses; enhavened scuts
5387,II,Flashing escape under show of a laugh nigh the mossed burrow-mouth.
5388,II,"Sack-like droop bronze pears on the nailed branch-frontage of huts,"
5389,II,To greet those wedded toilers from acres where sweat is a shower.
5390,II,"Snake, cicada, lizard, on lavender slopes up South,"
5391,II,Pant for joy of a sunlight driving the fielders to bower.
5392,II,Sharpened in silver by one chance breeze is the olive’s grey;

5403,II,"Treasureless, fetterless; free of the bonds of a great conceit:"
5404,II,Unwounded even by cruel blows on a body that writhes;
5405,II,Nor whimpering under misfortune; elusive of obstacles; prompt

5413,II,"Pushes of tentative curves, embryonic upwreathings in air;"
5414,II,Not always the sprouts of Earth’s root-Laws preserving her brutes;

5430,II,"Though broken at intervals, clipped, and barren in seeming it be."
5431,II,"For this at our nature arises rejuvenescent from Earth,"
5432,II,"However respersive the blow and nigh on infernal the fall,"
5433,II,The chastisement drawn down on us merited: are we of worth
5434,II,"Amid our satanic excrescences, this, for the less than a call,"
5435,II,"Will Earth reprime, man cherish; the God who is in us and round,"
5436,II,"Consenting, the God there seen.  Impiety speaks despair;"
5437,II,"Religion the virtue of serving as things of the furrowy ground,"
5438,II,Debtors for breath while breath with our fellows in service we share.

5447,III,Eastward of Paris morn is high;
5448,III,And darkness on that Eastward side
5449,III,The heart of France beholds: a thorn
5450,III,Is in her frame where shines the morn:
5451,III,"A rigid wave usurps her sky,"
5452,III,With eagle crest and eagle-eyed
5453,III,To scan what wormy wrinkles hint
5454,III,Her forces gathering: she the thrown
5455,III,"From station, lopped of an arm, astounded, lone,"
5456,III,Reading late History as a foul misprint:
5457,III,"Imperial, Angelical,"
5458,III,At strife commingled in her frame convulsed;
5459,III,"Shame of her broken sword, a ravening gall;"
5460,III,Pain of the limb where once her warm blood pulsed;
5461,III,These tortures to distract her underneath
5462,III,Her whelmed Aurora’s shade.  But in that space
5463,III,"When lay she dumb beside her trampled wreath,"
5464,III,"Like an unburied body mid the tombs,"
5465,III,Feeling against her heart life’s bitter probe
5466,III,"For life, she saw how children of her race,"
5467,III,"The many sober sons and daughters, plied,"
5468,III,"By cottage lamplight through the water-globe,"
5469,III,"By simmering stew-pots, by the serious looms,"
5470,III,"Afield, in factories, with the birds astir,"
5471,III,Their nimble feet and fingers; not denied
5472,III,"Refreshful chatter, laughter, galliard songs."
5473,III,"So like Earth’s indestructible they were,"
5474,III,"That wrestling with its anguish rose her pride,"
5475,III,"To feel where in each breast the thought of her,"
5476,III,"On whom the circle Hours laid leaded thongs,"
5477,III,Was constant; spoken sometimes in low tone
5478,III,"At lip or in a fluttered look,"
5479,III,A shortened breath: and they were her loved own;
5480,III,"Nor ever did they waste their strength with tears,"
5481,III,"For pity of the weeper, nor rebuke,"
5482,III,"Though mainly they were charged to pay her debt,"
5483,III,The Mother having conscience in arrears;
5484,III,"Ready to gush the flood of vain regret,"
5485,III,Else hearken to her weaponed children’s moan
5486,III,"Of stifled rage invoking vengeance: hell’s,"
5487,III,If heaven should fail the counter-wave that swells
5488,III,In blood and brain for retribution swift.
5489,III,Those helped not: wings to her soul were these who yet
5490,III,"Could welcome day for labour, night for rest,"
5491,III,"Enrich her treasury, built of cheerful thrift,"
5492,III,"Of honest heart, beyond all miracles;"
5493,III,And likened to Earth’s humblest were Earth’s best.

5501,IV,As aids that might the low-laid cripple lift;
5502,IV,"And one among them hummed devoutly leal,"
5503,IV,While passed the sighing breeze along her breast.
5504,IV,Of Kings by the festive vanquishers rammed down
5505,IV,"Her gorge since fell the Chief, she knew their crown;"
5506,IV,"Upon her through long seasons was its grasp,"
5507,IV,For neither soul’s nor body’s weal;
5508,IV,"As much bestows the robber wasp,"
5509,IV,"That in the hanging apple makes a meal,"
5510,IV,And carves a face of abscess where was fruit
5511,IV,Ripe ruddy.  They would blot
5512,IV,"Her radiant leap above the slopes acute,"
5513,IV,Of summit to celestial; impute
5514,IV,The wanton’s aim to her divinest shot;
5515,IV,Bid her walk History backward over gaps;
5516,IV,Abhor the day of Phrygian caps;
5517,IV,"Abjure her guerdon, execrate herself;"
5518,IV,"The Hapsburg, Hohenzollern, Guelph,"
5519,IV,Admire repentant; reverently prostrate
5520,IV,Her person unto the belly-god; of whom
5521,IV,Is inward plenty and external bloom;
5522,IV,Enough of pomp and state
5523,IV,And carnival to quench
5524,IV,"The breast’s desires of an intemperate wench,"
5525,IV,The head’s ideas beyond legitimate.
5526,IV,
5527,IV,She flung them: she was France: nor with far frown
5528,IV,Her lover from the embrace of her refrained:
5529,IV,"But in her voice an interwoven wire,"
5530,IV,"The exultation of her gross renown,"
5531,IV,"Struck deafness at her heavens, and they waned"
5532,IV,Over a look ill-gifted to aspire.
5533,IV,"Wherefore, as an abandonment, irate,"
5534,IV,"The intemperate summoned up her trumpet days,"
5535,IV,Her treasure-galleon’s wondrous freight.
5536,IV,The cannon-name she sang and shrieked; transferred
5537,IV,"Her soul’s allegiance; o’er the Tyrant slurred,"
5538,IV,"Tranced with the zeal of her first fawning gaze,"
5539,IV,To clasp his trophy flags and hail him Saint.

5542,V,V
5543,V,

5547,V,The virgin who conceived a France when funeral glooms
5548,V,Across a land aquake with sharp disseverance hung:
5549,V,"Conceived, and under stress of battle brought her forth;"
5550,V,Crowned her in purification of feud and foeman’s taint;
5551,V,"Taught her to feel her blood her being, know her worth,"
5552,V,"Have joy of unity: the Jeanne bescreeched, bescoffed,"
5553,V,"Who flamed to ashes, flew up wreaths of faggot fumes;"
5554,V,Through centuries a star in vapour-folds aloft.
5555,V,
5556,V,"For her people to hail her Saint,"
5557,V,"Were no lifting of her, Earth’s gem,"
5558,V,"Earth’s chosen, Earth’s throb on divine:"
5559,V,"In the ranks of the starred she is one,"
5560,V,While man has thought on our line:
5561,V,"No lifting of her, but for them,"
5562,V,"Breath of the mountain, beam of the sun"
5563,V,"Through mist, out of swamp-fires’ lures release,"
5564,V,"Youth on the forehead, the rough right way"
5565,V,"Seen to be footed: for them the heart’s peace,"
5566,V,By the mind’s war won for a permanent miracle day.
5567,V,
5568,V,"Her arms below her sword-hilt crossed,"
5569,V,The heart of that high-hallowed Jeanne
5570,V,Into the furnace-pit she tossed
5571,V,"Before her body knew the flame,"
5572,V,"And sucked its essence: warmth for righteous work,"
5573,V,An undivided power to speed her aim.
5574,V,She had no self but France: the sainted man
5575,V,"No France but self.  Him warrior and clerk,"
5576,V,"Free of his iron clutch; and him her young,"
5577,V,In whirled imagination mastodonized;
5578,V,"And him her penmen, him her poets; all"
5579,V,For the visioned treasure-galleon astrain;
5580,V,"Sent zenithward on bass and treble tongue,"
5581,V,Till solely through his glory France was prized.
5582,V,She who had her Jeanne;
5583,V,The child of her industrious;
5584,V,"Earth’s truest, earth’s pure fount from the main;"
5585,V,"And she who had her one day’s mate,"
5586,V,In the soul’s view illustrious
5587,V,"Past blazonry, her Immaculate,"
5588,V,Those hours of slavish Empire would recall;
5589,V,Thrill to the rattling anchor-chain
5590,V,She heard upon a day in ‘I who can’;
5591,V,"Start to the softened, tremulous bugle-blare"
5592,V,Of that Caesarean Italian
5593,V,"Across the storied fields of trampled grain,"
5594,V,As to a Vercingetorix of old Gaul
5595,V,Blowing the rally against a Caesar’s reign.
5596,V,Her soul’s protesting sobs she drowned to swear
5597,V,"Fidelity unto the sainted man,"
5598,V,Whose nimbus was her crown; and be again
5599,V,"The foreigner in Europe, known of none,"
5600,V,"None knowing; sight to dazzle, voice to stun."
5601,V,"Rearward she stepped, with thirst for Europe’s van;"
5602,V,"The dream she nursed a snare,"
5603,V,The flag she bore a pall.

5610,VI,Hard on the rock Reality do we dash
5611,VI,"To be shattered, if the material dream propels."
5612,VI,The worship to departed splendour vowed
5613,VI,"Conjured a simulacrum, wove her lash,"
5614,VI,For the slow measure timed her peal of bells.
5615,VI,
5616,VI,Thereof was the cannon-name a mockery round her hills;
5617,VI,"For the will of wills,"
5618,VI,"Its flaccid ape,"
5619,VI,Weak as the final echo off a giant’s bawl:
5620,VI,"Napoleon for disdain,"
5621,VI,His banner steeped in crape.
5622,VI,Thereof the barrier of Alsace-Lorraine;
5623,VI,The frozen billow crested to its fall;
5624,VI,Dismemberment; disfigurement;
5625,VI,Her history blotted; her proud mantle rent;
5626,VI,"And ever that one word to reperuse,"
5627,VI,With eyes behind a veil of fiery dews;
5628,VI,Knelling the spot where Gallic soil defiled
5629,VI,Showed her sons’ valour as a frenzied child
5630,VI,In arms of the mailed man.
5631,VI,"Word that her mind must bear, her heart put under ban,"
5632,VI,"Lest burst it: unto her eyes a ghost,"
5633,VI,Incredible though manifest: a scene
5634,VI,Stamped with her new Saint’s name: and all his host
5635,VI,A wattled flock the foeman’s dogs between!
5636,VI,
5637,VI,
5638,VII,VII
5639,VII,
5640,VII,
5641,VII,Mark where a credible ghost pulls bridle to view that bare
5642,VII,"Corpse of a field still reddening cloud, and alive in its throes"
5643,VII,Beneath her Purgatorial Saint’s evocative stare:
5644,VII,"Brand on his name, the gulf of his glory, his Legend’s close."
5645,VII,"A lustreless Phosphor heading for daybeam Night’s dead-born,"
5646,VII,His underworld eyeballs grip the cast of the land for a fray
5647,VII,"Expugnant; swift up the heights, with the Victor’s instinctive scorn"
5648,VII,"Of the trapped below, he rides; he beholds, and a two-fold grey,"
5649,VII,"Even as the misty sun growing moon that a frost enrings,"
5650,VII,Is shroud on the shrouded; he knows him there in the helmeted ranks.
5651,VII,"The golden eagles flap lame wings,"
5652,VII,The black double-headed are round their flanks.
5653,VII,"He is there in midst of the pupils he harried to brains awake, trod"
5654,VII,"into union; lo,"
5655,VII,"These are his Epic’s tutored Dardans, yon that Rhapsode’s Achaeans to"
5656,VII,know.
5657,VII,"Nor is aught of an equipollent conflict seen, nor the weaker’s flashed"
5658,VII,device;
5659,VII,"Headless is offered a breast to beaks deliberate, formal, assured,"
5660,VII,precise.
5661,VII,"Ruled by the mathematician’s hand, they solve their problem, as on a"
5662,VII,slate.
5663,VII,"This is the ground foremarked, and the day; their leader modestly"
5664,VII,hazarded date.
5665,VII,His helmeted ranks might be draggers of pools or reapers of plains for
5666,VII,the warrior’s guile
5667,VII,"Displayed; they haul, they rend, as in some orderly office mercantile."
5668,VII,And a timed artillery speaks full-mouthed on a stuttering feeble
5669,VII,reduced to nought.
5670,VII,"Can it be France, an army of France, tricked, netted, convulsive, all"
5671,VII,writhen caught?
5672,VII,Arterial blood of an army’s heart outpoured the Grey Observer sees:
5673,VII,"A forest of France in thunder comes, like a landslide hurled off her"
5674,VII,Pyrenees.
5675,VII,"Torrent and forest ramp, roll, sling on for a charge against iron,"
5676,VII,"reason, Fate;"
5677,VII,"It is gapped through the mass midway, bare ribs and dust ere the"
5678,VII,helmeted feel its weight.
5679,VII,So the blue billow white-plumed is plunged upon shingle to screaming
5680,VII,"withdrawal, but snatched,"
5681,VII,Waved is the laurel eternal yielded by Death o’er the waste of brave
5682,VII,men outmatched.
5683,VII,"The France of the fury was there, the thing he had wielded, whose"
5684,VII,honour was dearer than life;
5685,VII,"The Prussia despised, the harried, the trodden, was here; his pupil,"
5686,VII,the scholar in strife.
5687,VII,
5688,VII,"He hated to heel, in a spasm of will,"
5689,VII,"From sleep or debate, a mannikin squire"
5690,VII,With head of a merlin hawk and quill
5691,VII,Acrow on an ear.  At him rained fire
5692,VII,"From a blast of eyeballs hotter than speech,"
5693,VII,To say what a deadly poison stuffed
5694,VII,"The France here laid in her bloody ditch,"
5695,VII,Through the Legend passing human puffed.
5696,VII,
5697,VII,"Credible ghost of the field which from him descends,"
5698,VII,"Each dark anniversary day will its father return,"
5699,VII,"Haling his shadow to spy where the Legend ends,"
5700,VII,That penman trumpeter’s part in the wreck discern.
5701,VII,
5702,VII,"There, with the cup it presents at her lips, she stands,"
5703,VII,"France, with her future staked on the word it may pledge."
5704,VII,The vengeance urged of desire a reserve countermands;
5705,VII,The patience clasped totters hard on the precipice edge.
5706,VII,"Lopped of an arm, mother love for her own springs quick,"
5707,VII,"To curdle the milk in her breasts for the young they feed,"
5708,VII,"At thought of her single hand, and the lost so nigh."
5709,VII,"Mother love for her own, who raised her when she lay sick"
5710,VII,"Nigh death, and would in like fountains fruitlessly bleed,"
5711,VII,Withholds the fling of her heart on the further die.
5712,VII,
5713,VII,"Of love is wisdom.  Is it great love, then wise"
5714,VII,"Will our wild heart be, though whipped unto madness more"
5715,VII,By its mentor’s counselling voice than thoughtfully reined.
5716,VII,"Desire of the wave for the shore,"
5717,VII,"Passion for one last agony under skies,"
5718,VII,"To make her heavens remorseful, she restrained"
5719,VII,
5720,VII,
5721,VIII,VIII
5722,VIII,
5723,VIII,
5724,VIII,On her lost arm love bade her look;
5725,VIII,On her one hand to meditate;
5726,VIII,The tumult of her blood abate;
5727,VIII,"Disaster face, derision brook:"
5728,VIII,"Forbade the page of her Historic Muse,"
5729,VIII,"Until her demon his last hold forsook,"
5730,VIII,"And smoothly, with no countenance of hate,"
5731,VIII,Her conqueror she could scan to measure.  Thence
5732,VIII,"The strange new Winter stream of ruling sense,"
5733,VIII,"Cold, comfortless, but braced to disabuse,"
5734,VIII,Ran through the mind of this most lowly laid;
5735,VIII,"From the top billow of victorious War,"
5736,VIII,Down in the flagless troughs at ebb and flow;
5737,VIII,"A wreck; her past, her future, both in shade."
5738,VIII,She read the things that are;
5739,VIII,Reality unaccepted read
5740,VIII,"For sign of the distraught, and took her blow"
5741,VIII,To brain; herself read through;
5742,VIII,Wherefore her predatory Glory paid
5743,VIII,Napoleon ransom knew.
5744,VIII,Her nature’s many strings hot gusts did jar
5745,VIII,"Against the note of reason uttered low,"
5746,VIII,"Ere passionate with duty she might wed,"
5747,VIII,"Compel the bride’s embrace of her stern groom,"
5748,VIII,"Joined at an altar liker to the tomb,"
5749,VIII,"Nest of the Furies their first nuptial bed,"
5750,VIII,They not the less were mated and proclaimed
5751,VIII,The rational their issue.  Then she rose.
5752,VIII,
5753,VIII,See how the rush of southern Springtide glows
5754,VIII,"Oceanic in the chariot-wheel’s ascent,"
5755,VIII,"Illuminated with one breath.  The maimed,"
5756,VIII,"Tom, tortured, winter-visaged, suddenly"
5757,VIII,"Had stature; to the world’s wonderment,"
5758,VIII,"Fair features, grace of mien, nor least"
5759,VIII,"The comic dimples round her April mouth,"
5760,VIII,Sprung of her intimate humanity.
5761,VIII,She stood before mankind the very South
5762,VIII,Rapt out of frost to flowery drapery;
5763,VIII,Unshadowed save when somewhiles she looked East.
5764,VIII,
5765,VIII,
5766,IX,IX
5767,IX,
5768,IX,
5769,IX,"Let but the rational prevail,"
5770,IX,Our footing is on ground though all else fail:
5771,IX,Our kiss of Earth is then a plight
5772,IX,To walk within her Laws and have her light.
5773,IX,Choice of the life or death lies in ourselves;
5774,IX,There is no fate but when unreason lours.
5775,IX,"This Land the cheerful toiler delves,"
5776,IX,"The thinker brightens with fine wit,"
5777,IX,"The lovelier grace as lyric flowers,"
5778,IX,Those rosed and starred revolving Twelves
5779,IX,Shall nurse for effort infinite
5780,IX,While leashed to brain the heart of France the Fair
5781,IX,Beats tempered music and its lead subserves.
5782,IX,"Washed from her eyes the Napoleonic glare,"
5783,IX,"Divinely raised by that in her divine,"
5784,IX,Not the clear sight of Earth’s blunt actual swerves
5785,IX,"When her lost look, as on a wave of wine,"
5786,IX,"Rolls Eastward, and the mother-flag descries"
5787,IX,Caress with folds and curves
5788,IX,"The fortress over Rhine,"
5789,IX,Beneath the one tall spire.
5790,IX,"Despite her brooding thought, her nightlong sighs,"
5791,IX,"Her anguish in desire,"
5792,IX,"She sees, above the brutish paw"
5793,IX,Alert on her still quivering limb—
5794,IX,"As little in past time she saw,"
5795,IX,"Nor when dispieced as prey,"
5796,IX,As victrix when abhorred—
5797,IX,"A Grand Germania, stout on soil;"
5798,IX,Audacious up the ethereal dim;
5799,IX,The forest’s Infant; the strong hand for toil;
5800,IX,The patient brain in twilights when astray;
5801,IX,Shrewdest of heads to foil and counterfoil;
5802,IX,The sceptic and devout; the potent sword;
5803,IX,With will and armed to help in hewing way
5804,IX,For Europe’s march; and of the most golden chord
5805,IX,Of the Heliconian lyre
5806,IX,"Excellent mistress.  Yea, she sees, and can admire;"
5807,IX,Still seeing in what walks the Gallia leads;
5808,IX,And with what shield upon Alsace-Lorraine
5809,IX,Her wary sister’s doubtful look misreads
5810,IX,A mother’s throbs for her lost: so loved: so near:
5811,IX,"Magnetic.  Hard the course for her to steer,"
5812,IX,The leap against the sharpened spikes restrain.
5813,IX,"For the belted Overshadower hard the course,"
5814,IX,"On whom devolves the spirit’s touchstone, Force:"
5815,IX,"Which is the strenuous arm, to strike inclined,"
5816,IX,That too much adamantine makes the mind;
5817,IX,Forgets it coin of Nature’s rich Exchange;
5818,IX,Contracts horizons within present sight:
5819,IX,"Amalekite to-day, across its range"
5820,IX,Indisputable; to-morrow Simeonite.
5821,IX,

5824,X,
5825,X,
5826,X,The mother who gave birth to Jeanne;
5827,X,Who to her young Angelical sprang;
5828,X,"Who lay with Earth and heard the notes she sang,"
5829,X,And heard her truest sing them; she may reach
5830,X,Heights yet unknown of nations; haply teach
5831,X,A thirsting world to learn ’tis ‘she who can.’
5832,X,
5833,X,She that in History’s Heliaea pleads
5834,X,The nation flowering conscience o’er the beast;
5835,X,"With heart expurged of rancour, tame of greeds;"
5836,X,With the winged mind from fang and claw released;—
5837,X,Will such a land be seen?  It will be seen;—
5838,X,Shall stand adjudged our foremost and Earth’s Queen.
5839,X,Acknowledgement that she of God proceeds
5840,X,"The invisible makes visible, as his priest,"
5841,X,To her is yielded by a world reclaimed.
5842,X,"And stands she mutilated, fancy-shamed,"
5843,X,"Yet strong in arms, yet strong in self-control,"
5844,X,"Known valiant, her maternal throbs repressed,"
5845,X,"Discarding vengeance, Giant with a soul;—"
5846,X,My faith in her when she lay low
5847,X,Was fountain; now as wave at flow
5848,X,"Beneath the lights, my faith in God is best;—"
5849,X,On France has come the test
5850,X,Of what she holds within
5851,X,Responsive to Life’s deeper springs.
5852,X,She above the nations blest
5853,X,"In fruitful and in liveliest,"
5854,X,"In all that servant earth to heavenly bidding brings,"
5855,X,"The devotee of Glory, she may win"
5856,X,"Glory despoiling none, enrich her kind,"
5857,X,"Illume her land, and take the royal seat"
5858,X,Unto the strong self-conqueror assigned.
5859,X,"But ah, when speaks a loaded breath the double name,"
5860,X,Humanity’s old Foeman winks agrin.
5861,X,"Her constant Angel eyes her heart’s quick beat,"
5862,X,The thrill of shadow coursing through her frame.
5863,X,Like wind among the ranks of amber wheat.
5864,X,"Our Europe, vowed to unity or torn,"
5865,X,"Observes her face, as shepherds note the morn,"
5866,X,And in a ruddy beacon mark an end
5867,X,That for the flock in their grave hearing rings.
5868,X,Specked overhead the imminent vulture wings
5869,X,"At poise, one fatal movement indiscreet,"
5870,X,"Sprung from the Aetna passions’ mad revolts,"
5871,X,Draws down; the midnight hovers to descend;
5872,X,And dire as Indian noons of ulcer heat
5873,X,"Anticipating tempest and the bolts,"
5874,X,"Hangs curtained terrors round her next day’s door,"
5875,X,Death’s emblems for the breast of Europe flings;
5876,X,The breast that waits a spark to fire her store.
5877,X,"Shall, then, the great vitality, France,"
5878,X,Signal the backward step once more;
5879,X,Again a Goddess Fortune trace
5880,X,"Amid the Deities, and pledge to chance"
5881,X,One whom we never could replace?
5882,X,Now may she tune her nature’s many strings
5883,X,"To noble harmony, be seen, be known."
5884,X,
5885,X,"It was the foreign France, the unruly, feared;"
5886,X,Little for all her witcheries endeared;
5887,X,"Theatrical of arrogance, a sprite"
5888,X,"With gaseous vapours overblown,"
5889,X,"In her conceit of power ensphered,"
5890,X,Foredoomed to violate and atone;
5891,X,Her the grim conqueror’s iron might
5892,X,"Avengeing clutched, distrusting rent;"
5893,X,Not that sharp intellect with fire endowed
5894,X,"To cleave our webs, run lightnings through our cloud;"
5895,X,"Not virtual France, the France benevolent,"
5896,X,"The chivalrous, the many-stringed, sublime"
5897,X,"At intervals, and oft in sweetest chime;"
5898,X,"Though perilously instrument,"
5899,X,A breast for any having godlike gleam.
5900,X,"This France could no antagonist disesteem,"
5901,X,To spurn at heel and confiscate her brood.
5902,X,"Albeit a waverer between heart and mind,"
5903,X,"And laurels won from sky or plucked from blood,"
5904,X,"Which wither all the wreath when intertwined,"
5905,X,This cherishable France she may redeem.
5906,X,"Beloved of Earth, her heart should feel at length"
5907,X,How much unto Earth’s offspring it doth owe.
5908,X,"Obstructions are for levelling, have we strength;"
5909,X,’Tis poverty of soul conceived a foe.
5910,X,Rejected be the wrath that keeps unhealed
5911,X,Her panting wound; to higher Courts appealed
5912,X,The wrongs discerned of higher: Europe waits:
5913,X,She chooses God or gambles with the Fates.
5914,X,"Shines the new Helen in Alsace-Lorraine,"
5915,X,"A darker river severs Rhine and Rhone,"
5916,X,Is heard a deadlier Epic of the twain;
5917,X,We see a Paris burn
5918,X,Or France Napoleon.
5919,X,
5920,X,For yet he breathes whom less her heart forswears
5921,X,While trembles its desire to thwart her mind:
5922,X,The Tyrant lives in Victory’s return.
5923,X,What figure with recurrent footstep fares
5924,X,"Around those memoried tracks of scarlet mud,"
5925,X,To sow her future from an ashen urn
5926,X,"By lantern-light, as dragons’ teeth are sown?"
5927,X,Of bleeding pride the piercing seër is blind.
5928,X,"But, cleared her eyes of that ensanguined scud"
5929,X,"Distorting her true features, to be shown"
5930,X,"Benignly luminous, one who bears"
5931,X,"Humanity at breast, and she might learn"
5932,X,How surely the excelling generous find
5933,X,Renouncement is possession.  Sure
5934,X,"As light enkindles light when heavenly earthly mates,"
5935,X,"The flame of pure immits the flame of pure,"
5936,X,Magnanimous magnanimous creates.
5937,X,So to majestic beauty stricken rears
5938,X,Hard-visaged rock against the risen glow;
5939,X,"And men are in the secret with the spheres,"
5940,X,Whose glory is celestially to bestow.
5941,X,
5942,X,"Now nation looks to nation, that may live"
5943,X,"Their common nurseling, like the torrent’s flower,"
5944,X,Shaken by foul Destruction’s fast-piled heap.
5945,X,On France is laid the proud initiative
5946,X,"Of sacrifice in one self-mastering hour,"
5947,X,Whereby more than her lost one will she reap;
5948,X,"Perchance the very lost regain,"
5949,X,To count it less than her superb reward.
5950,X,"Our Europe, where is debtor each to each,"
5951,X,"Pass measure of excess, and war is Cain,"
5952,X,"Fraternal from the Seaman’s beach,"
5953,X,"From answering Rhine in grand accord,"
5954,X,"From Neva beneath Northern cloud,"
5955,X,"And from our Transatlantic Europe loud,"
5956,X,Will hail the rare example for their theme;
5957,X,"Give response, as rich foliage to the breeze;"
5958,X,In their entrusted nurseling know them one:
5959,X,"Like a brave vessel under press of steam,"
5960,X,"Abreast the winds and tides, on angry seas,"
5961,X,"Plucked by the heavens forlorn of present sun,"
5962,X,"Will drive through darkness, and, with faith supreme,"
5963,X,Have sight of haven and the crowded quays.

6331,A GARDEN IDYL,"This muted drama, hour by hour,"
6332,A GARDEN IDYL,"I watched amid a world in flower,"
6333,A GARDEN IDYL,Ere yet Autumnal threads had laid
6334,A GARDEN IDYL,"Their gray-blue o’er the grass’s blade,"
6335,A GARDEN IDYL,And still along the garden-run
6336,A GARDEN IDYL,"The blindworm stretched him, drunk of sun."
6337,A GARDEN IDYL,Arachne crouched unmoved; perchance
6338,A GARDEN IDYL,Her visitor performed a dance;
6339,A GARDEN IDYL,She puckered thinner; he the same
6340,A GARDEN IDYL,As when on that light wind he came.
6341,A GARDEN IDYL,
6342,A GARDEN IDYL,Next day was told what deeds of night
6343,A GARDEN IDYL,Were done; the web had vanished quite;
6344,A GARDEN IDYL,With it the strange opposing pair;
6345,A GARDEN IDYL,"And listless waved on vacant air,"
6346,A GARDEN IDYL,"For her adieu to heart’s content,"
6347,A GARDEN IDYL,A solitary filament.

6516,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In dusk of the underworld’s perpetual eve,"
6517,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The paths among the meadow asphodel,"
6518,WITH THE PERSUADER,Remembering.  Never there her face
6519,WITH THE PERSUADER,Is planetary; reddens to shore sea-shell
6520,WITH THE PERSUADER,Around such whiteness the enamoured air
6521,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Of noon that clothes her, never there."
6522,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Daughter of light, the joyful light,"
6523,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She stands unveiled to nuptial sight,"
6524,WITH THE PERSUADER,Sweet in her disregard of aid
6525,WITH THE PERSUADER,Divine to conquer or persuade.
6526,WITH THE PERSUADER,A fountain jets from moss; a flower
6527,WITH THE PERSUADER,Bends gently where her sunset tresses shower.
6528,WITH THE PERSUADER,By guerdon of her brilliance may be seen
6529,WITH THE PERSUADER,With eyelids unabashed the passion’s Queen.
6530,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6531,WITH THE PERSUADER,Shorn of attendant Graces she can use
6532,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her natural snares to make her will supreme.
6533,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A simple nymph it is, inclined to muse"
6534,WITH THE PERSUADER,Before the leader foot shall dip in stream:
6535,WITH THE PERSUADER,One arm at curve along a rounded thigh;
6536,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her firm new breasts each pointing its own way
6537,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A knee half bent to shade its fellow shy,"
6538,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Where innocence, not nature, signals nay."
6539,WITH THE PERSUADER,The bud of fresh virginity awaits
6540,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The wooer, and all roseate will she burst:"
6541,WITH THE PERSUADER,She touches on the hour of happy mates;
6542,WITH THE PERSUADER,Still is she unaware she wakens thirst.
6543,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6544,WITH THE PERSUADER,And while commanding blissful sight believe
6545,WITH THE PERSUADER,"It holds her as a body strained to breast,"
6546,WITH THE PERSUADER,Down on the underworld’s perpetual eve
6547,WITH THE PERSUADER,She plunges the possessor dispossessed;
6548,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And bids believe that image, heaving warm,"
6549,WITH THE PERSUADER,Is lost to float like torch-smoke after flame;
6550,WITH THE PERSUADER,The phantom any breeze blows out of form;
6551,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A thirst’s delusion, a defeated aim."
6552,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6553,WITH THE PERSUADER,The rapture shed the torture weaves;
6554,WITH THE PERSUADER,The direst blow on human heart she deals:
6555,WITH THE PERSUADER,The pain to know the seen deceives;
6556,WITH THE PERSUADER,Nought true but what insufferably feels.
6557,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And stabs of her delicious note,"
6558,WITH THE PERSUADER,"That is as heavenly light to hearing, heard"
6559,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Through shelter leaves, the laughter from her throat,"
6560,WITH THE PERSUADER,We answer as the midnight’s morning’s bird.
6561,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6562,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She laughs, she wakens gleeful cries;"
6563,WITH THE PERSUADER,In her delicious laughter part revealed;
6564,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yet mother is she more of moans and sighs,"
6565,WITH THE PERSUADER,For longings unappeased and wounds unhealed.
6566,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yet would she bless, it is her task to bless:"
6567,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yon folded couples, passing under shade,"
6568,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Are her rich harvest; bidden caress, caress,"
6569,WITH THE PERSUADER,Consume the fruit in bloom; not disobeyed.
6570,WITH THE PERSUADER,"We dolorous complainers had a dream,"
6571,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Wrought on the vacant air from inner fire,"
6572,WITH THE PERSUADER,We saw stand bare of her celestial beam
6573,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The glorious Goddess, and we dared desire."
6574,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6575,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Thereat are shown reproachful eyes, and lips"
6576,WITH THE PERSUADER,Of upward curl to meanings half obscure;
6577,WITH THE PERSUADER,And glancing where a wood-nymph lightly skips
6578,WITH THE PERSUADER,She nods: at once that creature wears her lure.
6579,WITH THE PERSUADER,Blush of our being between birth and death:
6580,WITH THE PERSUADER,Sob of our ripened blood for its next breath:
6581,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her wily semblance nought of her denies;
6582,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Seems it the Goddess runs, the Goddess hies,"
6583,WITH THE PERSUADER,The generous Goddess yields.  And she can arm
6584,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her dwarfed and twisted with her secret charm;
6585,WITH THE PERSUADER,Benevolent as Earth to feed her own.
6586,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Fully shall they be fed, if they beseech."
6587,WITH THE PERSUADER,But scorn she has for them that walk alone;
6588,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Blanched men, starved women, whom no arts can pleach."
6589,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The men as chief of criminals she disdains,"
6590,WITH THE PERSUADER,And holds the reason in perceptive thought.
6591,WITH THE PERSUADER,"More pitiable, like rivers lacking rains,"
6592,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Kissing cold stones, the women shrink for drought."
6593,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Those faceless discords, out of nature strayed,"
6594,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Rank of the putrefaction ere decayed,"
6595,WITH THE PERSUADER,In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths:
6596,WITH THE PERSUADER,Their lives are where harmonious Pleasure breathes
6597,WITH THE PERSUADER,For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew.
6598,WITH THE PERSUADER,Comes there a tremor of night’s forest horn
6599,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Across her garden from the insaner crew,"
6600,WITH THE PERSUADER,She darkens to malignity of scorn.
6601,WITH THE PERSUADER,A shiver courses through her garden-grounds:
6602,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Grunt of the tusky boar, the baying hounds,"
6603,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The hunter’s shouts, are heard afar, and bring"
6604,WITH THE PERSUADER,Dead on her heart her crimsoned flower of Spring.
6605,WITH THE PERSUADER,"These, the irreverent of Life’s design,"
6606,WITH THE PERSUADER,Division between natural and divine
6607,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Would cast; these vaunting barrenness for best,"
6608,WITH THE PERSUADER,In veins of gathered strength Life’s tide arrest;
6609,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And these because the roses flood their cheeks,"
6610,WITH THE PERSUADER,Vow them in nature wise as when Love speaks.
6611,WITH THE PERSUADER,With them is war; and well the Goddess knows
6612,WITH THE PERSUADER,What undermines the race who mount the rose;
6613,WITH THE PERSUADER,"How the ripe moment, lodged in slumberous hours,"
6614,WITH THE PERSUADER,Enkindled by persuasion overpowers:
6615,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds,"
6616,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The strong when Beauty gleams o’er Nature’s needs,"
6617,WITH THE PERSUADER,And timely guile unguarded finds them lie.
6618,WITH THE PERSUADER,"They who her sway withstand a sea defy,"
6619,WITH THE PERSUADER,At every point of juncture must be proof;
6620,WITH THE PERSUADER,Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge
6621,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge
6622,WITH THE PERSUADER,For the one whelming wave to spring aloof.
6623,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She, tenderness, is pitiless to them"
6624,WITH THE PERSUADER,Resisting in her godhead nature’s truth.
6625,WITH THE PERSUADER,"No flower their face shall be, but writhen stem;"
6626,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Their youth a frost, their age the dirge for youth."
6627,WITH THE PERSUADER,"These miserably disinclined,"
6628,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The lamentably unembraced,"
6629,WITH THE PERSUADER,Insult the Pleasures Earth designed
6630,WITH THE PERSUADER,To people and beflower the waste.
6631,WITH THE PERSUADER,Wherefore the Pleasures pass them by:
6632,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For death they live, in life they die."
6633,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6634,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her head the Goddess from them turns,"
6635,WITH THE PERSUADER,As from grey mounds of ashes in bronze urns.
6636,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She views her quivering couples unconsoled,"
6637,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And of her beauty mirror they become,"
6638,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Like orchard blossoms, apple, pear and plum,"
6639,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Free of the cloud, beneath the flood of gold."
6640,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Crowned with wreaths that burn in dew,"
6641,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her couples whirl, sun-satiated,"
6642,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Athirst for shade, they sigh, they wed,"
6643,WITH THE PERSUADER,They play the music made of two:
6644,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Oldest of earth, earth’s youngest till earth’s end:"
6645,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Cunninger than the numbered strings,"
6646,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For melodies, for harmonies,"
6647,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For mastered discords, and the things"
6648,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Not vocable, whose mysteries"
6649,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Are inmost Love’s, Life’s reach of Life extend."
6650,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6651,WITH THE PERSUADER,Is it an anguish overflowing shame
6652,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And the tongue’s pudency confides to her,"
6653,WITH THE PERSUADER,"With eyes of embers, breath of incense myrrh,"
6654,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The woman’s marrow in some dear youth’s name,"
6655,WITH THE PERSUADER,Then is the Goddess tenderness
6656,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Maternal, and she has a sister’s tones"
6657,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Benign to soothe intemperate distress,"
6658,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Divide despair from hope, and sighs from moans."
6659,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her gentleness imparts exhaling ease
6660,WITH THE PERSUADER,To those of her milk-bearer votaries
6661,WITH THE PERSUADER,As warm of bosom-earth as she; of the source
6662,WITH THE PERSUADER,Direct; erratic but in heart’s excess;
6663,WITH THE PERSUADER,Being mortal and ill-matched for Love’s great force;
6664,WITH THE PERSUADER,Like green leaves caught with flames by his impress.
6665,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And pray they under skies less overcast,"
6666,WITH THE PERSUADER,"That swiftly may her star of eve descend,"
6667,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her lustrous morning star fly not too fast,"
6668,WITH THE PERSUADER,To lengthen blissful night will she befriend.
6669,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6670,WITH THE PERSUADER,Unfailing her reply to woman’s voice
6671,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In supplication instant.  Is it man’s,"
6672,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She hears, approves his words, her garden scans,"
6673,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And him: the flowers are various, he has choice."
6674,WITH THE PERSUADER,Perchance his wound is deep; she listens long;
6675,WITH THE PERSUADER,Enjoys what music fills the plaintive song;
6676,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And marks how he, who would be hawk at poise"
6677,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Above the bird, his plaintive song enjoys."
6678,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6679,WITH THE PERSUADER,She reads him when his humbled manhood weeps
6680,WITH THE PERSUADER,To her invoked: distraction is implored.
6681,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A smile, and he is up on godlike leaps"
6682,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Above, with his bright Goddess owned the adored."
6683,WITH THE PERSUADER,His tales of her declare she condescends;
6684,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Can share his fires, not always goads and rends:"
6685,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Moreover, quits a throne, and must enclose"
6686,WITH THE PERSUADER,A queenlier gem than woman’s wayside rose.
6687,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She bends, he quickens; she breathes low, he springs"
6688,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Enraptured; low she laughs, his woes disperse;"
6689,WITH THE PERSUADER,Aloud she laughs and sweeps his varied strings.
6690,WITH THE PERSUADER,’Tis taught him how for touch of mournful verse
6691,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Rarely the music made of two ascends,"
6692,WITH THE PERSUADER,And Beauty’s Queen some other way is won.
6693,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or it may solve the riddle, that she lends"
6694,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Herself to all, and yields herself to none,"
6695,WITH THE PERSUADER,Save heavenliest: though claims by men are raised
6696,WITH THE PERSUADER,In hot assurance under shade of doubt:
6697,WITH THE PERSUADER,And numerous are the images bepraised
6698,WITH THE PERSUADER,"As Beauty’s Queen, should passion head the rout."
6699,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6700,WITH THE PERSUADER,Be sure the ruddy hue is Love’s: to woo
6701,WITH THE PERSUADER,Love’s Fountain we must mount the ruddy hue.
6702,WITH THE PERSUADER,"That is her garden’s precept, seen where shines"
6703,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her blood-flower, and its unsought neighbour pines."
6704,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Daughter of light, the joyful light,"
6705,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She bids her couples face full East,"
6706,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Reflecting radiance, even when from her feast"
6707,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Their outstretched arms brown deserts disunite,"
6708,WITH THE PERSUADER,The lion-haunted thickets hold apart.
6709,WITH THE PERSUADER,In love the ruddy hue declares great heart;
6710,WITH THE PERSUADER,High confidence in her whose aid is lent
6711,WITH THE PERSUADER,"To lovers lifting the tuned instrument,"
6712,WITH THE PERSUADER,Not one of rippled strings and funeral tone.
6713,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And doth the man pursue a tightened zone,"
6714,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Then be it as the Laurel God he runs,"
6715,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Confirmed to win, with countenance the Sun’s."
6716,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6717,WITH THE PERSUADER,Should pity bless the tremulous voice of woe
6718,WITH THE PERSUADER,"He lifts for pity, limp his offspring show."
6719,WITH THE PERSUADER,For him requiring woman’s arts to please
6720,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Infantile tastes with babe reluctances,"
6721,WITH THE PERSUADER,No race of giants!  In the woman’s veins
6722,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Persuasion ripely runs, through hers the pains."
6723,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her choice of him, should kind occasion nod,"
6724,WITH THE PERSUADER,Aspiring blends the Titan with the God;
6725,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yet unto dwarf and mortal, she, submiss"
6726,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In her high Lady’s mandate, yields the kiss;"
6727,WITH THE PERSUADER,And is it needed that Love’s daintier brute
6728,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Be snared as hunter, she will tempt pursuit."
6729,WITH THE PERSUADER,She is great Nature’s ever intimate
6730,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In breast, and doth as ready handmaid wait,"
6731,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Until perverted by her senseless male,"
6732,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She plays the winding snake, the shrinking snail,"
6733,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The flying deer, all tricks of evil fame,"
6734,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Elusive to allure, since he grew tame."
6735,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6736,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Hence has the Goddess, Nature’s earliest Power,"
6737,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And greatest and most present, with her dower"
6738,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Of the transcendent beauty, gained repute"
6739,WITH THE PERSUADER,For meditated guile.  She laughs to hear
6740,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A charge her garden’s labyrinths scarce confute,"
6741,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her garden’s histories tell of to all near.
6742,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Let it be said, But less upon her guile"
6743,WITH THE PERSUADER,Doth she rely for her immortal smile.
6744,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Still let the rumour spread, and terror screens"
6745,WITH THE PERSUADER,To push her conquests by the simplest means.
6746,WITH THE PERSUADER,"While man abjures not lustihead, nor swerves"
6747,WITH THE PERSUADER,"From earth’s good labours, Beauty’s Queen he serves."
6748,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6749,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her spacious garden and her garden’s grant
6750,WITH THE PERSUADER,She offers in reward for handsome cheer:
6751,WITH THE PERSUADER,Choice of the nymphs whose looks will slant
6752,WITH THE PERSUADER,The secret down a dewy leer
6753,WITH THE PERSUADER,Of corner eyelids into haze:
6754,WITH THE PERSUADER,Many a fair Aphrosyne
6755,WITH THE PERSUADER,Like flower-bell to honey-bee:
6756,WITH THE PERSUADER,And here they flicker round the maze
6757,WITH THE PERSUADER,Bewildering him in heart and head:
6758,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And here they wear the close demure,"
6759,WITH THE PERSUADER,With subtle peeps to reassure:
6760,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Others parade where love has bled,"
6761,WITH THE PERSUADER,And of its crimson weave their mesh:
6762,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Others to snap of fingers leap,"
6763,WITH THE PERSUADER,As bearing breast with love asleep.
6764,WITH THE PERSUADER,These are her laughters in the flesh.
6765,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or would she fit a warrior mood,"
6766,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She lights her seeming unsubdued,"
6767,WITH THE PERSUADER,And indicates the fortress-key.
6768,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or is it heart for heart that craves,"
6769,WITH THE PERSUADER,She flecks along a run of waves
6770,WITH THE PERSUADER,The one to promise deeper sea.
6771,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6772,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Bands of her limpid primitives,"
6773,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or patterned in the curious braid,"
6774,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Are the blest man’s; and whatsoever he gives,"
6775,WITH THE PERSUADER,For what he gives is he repaid.
6776,WITH THE PERSUADER,Good is it if by him ’tis held
6777,WITH THE PERSUADER,He wins the fairest ever welled
6778,WITH THE PERSUADER,From Nature’s founts: she whispers it: Even I
6779,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Not fairer! and forbids him to deny,"
6780,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Else little is he lover.  Those he clasps,"
6781,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Intent as tempest, worshipful as prayer,—"
6782,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And be they doves or be they asps,—"
6783,WITH THE PERSUADER,Must seem to him the sovereignty fair;
6784,WITH THE PERSUADER,Else counts he soon among life’s wholly tamed.
6785,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Him whom from utter savage she reclaimed,"
6786,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Half savage must he stay, would he be crowned"
6787,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The lover.  Else, past ripeness, deathward bound,"
6788,WITH THE PERSUADER,"He reasons; and the totterer Earth detests,"
6789,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Love shuns, grim logic screws in grasp, is he."
6790,WITH THE PERSUADER,Doth man divide divine Necessity
6791,WITH THE PERSUADER,"From Joy, between the Queen of Beauty’s breasts"
6792,WITH THE PERSUADER,A sword is driven; for those most glorious twain
6793,WITH THE PERSUADER,Present her; armed to bless and to constrain.
6794,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Of this he perishes; not she, the throned"
6795,WITH THE PERSUADER,On rocks that spout their springs to the sacred mounts.
6796,WITH THE PERSUADER,A loftier Reason out of deeper founts
6797,WITH THE PERSUADER,Earth’s chosen Goddess bears: by none disowned
6798,WITH THE PERSUADER,"While red blood runs to swell the pulse, she boasts,"
6799,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And Beauty, like her star, descends the sky;"
6800,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Earth’s answer, heaven’s consent unto man’s cry,"
6801,WITH THE PERSUADER,Uplifted by the innumerable hosts.
6802,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6803,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Quickened of Nature’s eye and ear,"
6804,WITH THE PERSUADER,When the wild sap at high tide smites
6805,WITH THE PERSUADER,Within us; or benignly clear
6806,WITH THE PERSUADER,To vision; or as the iris lights
6807,WITH THE PERSUADER,On fluctuant waters; she is ours
6808,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Till set of man: the dreamed, the seen;"
6809,WITH THE PERSUADER,Flushing the world with odorous flowers:
6810,WITH THE PERSUADER,A soft compulsion on terrene
6811,WITH THE PERSUADER,By heavenly: and the world is hers
6812,WITH THE PERSUADER,While hunger after Beauty spurs.
6813,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6814,WITH THE PERSUADER,So is it sung in any space
6815,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She fills, with laugh at shallow laws"
6816,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Forbidding love’s devised embrace,"
6817,WITH THE PERSUADER,The music Beauty from it draws.
6818,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6819,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6820,WITH THE PERSUADER,
6821,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,THE TEST OF MANHOOD
6822,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6823,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6824,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"LIKE a flood river whirled at rocky banks,"
6825,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"An army issues out of wilderness,"
6826,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,With battle plucking round its ragged flanks;
6827,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Obstruction in the van; insane excess
6828,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Oft at the heart; yet hard the onward stress
6829,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Unto more spacious, where move ordered ranks,"
6830,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And rise hushed temples built of shapely stone,"
6831,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The work of hands not pledged to grind or slay.
6832,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,They gave our earth a dress of flesh on bone;
6833,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A tongue to speak with answering heaven gave they.
6834,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Then was the gracious birth of man’s new day;
6835,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Divided from the haunted night it shone.
6836,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6837,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That quiet dawn was Reverence; whereof sprang
6838,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Ethereal Beauty in full morningtide.
6839,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Another sun had risen to clasp his bride:
6840,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,It was another earth unto him sang.
6841,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6842,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Came Reverence from the Huntress on her heights?
6843,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"From the Persuader came it, in those vales"
6844,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Whereunto she melodiously invites,"
6845,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Her troops of eager servitors regales?
6846,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Not far those two great Powers of Nature speed
6847,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Disciple steps on earth when sole they lead;
6848,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Nor either points for us the way of flame.
6849,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,From him predestined mightier it came;
6850,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His task to hold them both in breast, and yield"
6851,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Their dues to each, and of their war be field."
6852,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6853,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The foes that in repulsion never ceased,"
6854,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Must he, who once has been the goodly beast"
6855,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Of one or other, at whose beck he ran,"
6856,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Constrain to make him serviceable man;
6857,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Offending neither, nor the natural claim"
6858,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Each pressed, denying, for his true man’s name."
6859,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6860,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Ah, what a sweat of anguish in that strife"
6861,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To hold them fast conjoined within him still;
6862,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Submissive to his will
6863,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Along the road of life!
6864,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And marvel not he wavered if at whiles
6865,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The forward step met frowns, the backward smiles."
6866,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,For Pleasure witched him her sweet cup to drain;
6867,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Repentance offered ecstasy in pain.
6868,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Delicious licence called it Nature’s cry;
6869,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Ascetic rigours crushed the fleshly sigh;
6870,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A tread on shingle timed his lame advance
6871,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Flung as the die of Bacchanalian Chance,"
6872,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He of the troubled marching army leaned
6873,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"On godhead visible, on godhead screened;"
6874,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The radiant roseate, the curtained white;"
6875,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Yet sharp his battle strained through day, through night."
6876,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6877,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He drank of fictions, till celestial aid"
6878,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Might seem accorded when he fawned and prayed;
6879,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Sagely the generous Giver circumspect,"
6880,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To choose for grants the egregious, his elect;"
6881,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And ever that imagined succour slew
6882,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The soul of brotherhood whence Reverence drew.
6883,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6884,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,In fellowship religion has its founts:
6885,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The solitary his own God reveres:
6886,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Ascend no sacred Mounts
6887,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Our hungers or our fears.
6888,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,As only for the numbers Nature’s care
6889,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Is shown, and she the personal nothing heeds,"
6890,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,So to Divinity the spring of prayer
6891,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,From brotherhood the one way upward leads.
6892,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Like the sustaining air
6893,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Are both for flowers and weeds.
6894,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But he who claims in spirit to be flower,"
6895,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Will find them both an air that doth devour.
6896,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6897,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Whereby he smelt his treason, who implored"
6898,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,External gifts bestowed but on the sword;
6899,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Beheld himself, with less and less disguise,"
6900,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Through those blood-cataracts which dimmed his eyes,"
6901,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His army’s foe, condemned to strive and fail;"
6902,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,See a black adversary’s ghost prevail;
6903,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Never, though triumphs hailed him, hope to win"
6904,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,While still the conflict tore his breast within.
6905,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6906,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Out of that agony, misread for those"
6907,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Imprisoned Powers warring unappeased,"
6908,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The ghost of his black adversary rose,"
6909,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To smother light, shut heaven, show earth diseased."
6910,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And long with him was wrestling ere emerged
6911,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A mind to read in him the reflex shade
6912,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Of its fierce torment; this way, that way urged;"
6913,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,By craven compromises hourly swayed.
6914,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6915,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Crouched as a nestling, still its wings untried,"
6916,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The man’s mind opened under weight of cloud.
6917,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To penetrate the dark was it endowed;
6918,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Stood day before a vision shooting wide.
6919,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Whereat the spectral enemy lost form;
6920,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The traversed wilderness exposed its track.
6921,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He felt the far advance in looking back;
6922,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Thence trust in his foot forward through the storm.
6923,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6924,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Under the low-browed tempest’s eye of ire,"
6925,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"That ere it lightened smote a coward heart,"
6926,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Earth nerved her chastened son to hail athwart
6927,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,All ventures perilous his shrouded Sire;
6928,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A stranger still, religiously divined;"
6929,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Not yet with understanding read aright.
6930,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But when the mind, the cherishable mind,"
6931,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The multitude’s grave shepherd, took full flight,"
6932,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Himself as mirror raised among his kind,"
6933,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He saw, and first of brotherhood had sight:"
6934,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Knew that his force to fly, his will to see,"
6935,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His heart enlarged beyond its ribbed domain,"
6936,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Had come of many a grip in mastery,"
6937,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Which held conjoined the hostile rival twain,"
6938,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And of his bosom made him lord, to keep"
6939,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The starry roof of his unruffled frame
6940,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Awake to earth, to heaven, and plumb the deep"
6941,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Below, above, aye with a wistful aim."
6942,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6943,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The mastering mind in him, by tempests blown,"
6944,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"By traitor inmates baited, upward burned;"
6945,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Perforce of growth, the Master mind discerned,"
6946,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The Great Unseen, nowise the Dark Unknown."
6947,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To whom unwittingly did he aspire
6948,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"In wilderness, where bitter was his need:"
6949,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To whom in blindness, as an earthy seed"
6950,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"For light and air, he struck through crimson mire."
6951,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But not ere he upheld a forehead lamp,"
6952,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And viewed an army, once the seeming doomed,"
6953,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"All choral in its fruitful garden camp,"
6954,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The spiritual the palpable illumed.
6955,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6956,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"This gift of penetration and embrace,"
6957,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His prize from tidal battles lost or won,"
6958,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Reveals the scheme to animate his race:
6959,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,How that it is a warfare but begun;
6960,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Unending; with no Power to interpose;
6961,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"No prayer, save for strength to keep his ground,"
6962,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Heard of the Highest; never battle’s close,"
6963,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The victory complete and victor crowned:
6964,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Nor solace in defeat, save from that sense"
6965,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Of strength well spent, which is the strength renewed."
6966,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,In manhood must he find his competence;
6967,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,In his clear mind the spiritual food:
6968,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,God being there while he his fight maintains;
6969,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Throughout his mind the Master Mind being there,"
6970,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,While he rejects the suicide despair;
6971,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Accepts the spur of explicable pains;
6972,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Obedient to Nature, not her slave:"
6973,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Her lord, if to her rigid laws he bows;"
6974,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Her dust, if with his conscience he plays knave,"
6975,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse:—
6976,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Whence Evil in a world unread before;
6977,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That mystery to simple springs resolved.
6978,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His God the Known, diviner to adore,"
6979,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Shows Nature’s savage riddles kindly solved.
6980,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Inconscient, insensitive, she reigns"
6981,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"In iron laws, though rapturous fair her face."
6982,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Back to the primal brute shall he retrace
6983,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His path, doth he permit to force her chains"
6984,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A soft Persuader coursing through his veins,"
6985,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,An icy Huntress stringing to the chase:
6986,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,What one the flash disdains;
6987,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,What one so gives it grace.
6988,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
6989,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But is he rightly manful in her eyes,"
6990,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A splendid bloodless knight to gain the skies,"
6991,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A blood-hot son of Earth by all her signs,"
6992,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Desireing and desireable he shines;
6993,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"As peaches, that have caught the sun’s uprise"
6994,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And kissed warm gold till noonday, even as vines."
6995,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Earth fills him with her juices, without fear"
6996,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That she will cast him drunken down the steeps.
6997,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,All woman is she to this man most dear;
6998,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He sows for bread, and she in spirit reaps:"
6999,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"She conscient, she sensitive, in him;"
7000,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"With him enwound, his brave ambition hers:"
7001,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,By him humaner made; by his keen spurs
7002,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Pricked to race past the pride in giant limb,"
7003,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Her crazy adoration of big thews,"
7004,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Proud in her primal sons, when crags they hurled,"
7005,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Were thunder spitting lightnings on the world
7006,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"In daily deeds, and she their evening Muse."
7007,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
7008,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"This man, this hero, works not to destroy;"
7009,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,This godlike—as the rock in ocean stands;—
7010,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He of the myriad eyes, the myriad hands"
7011,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Creative; in his edifice has joy.
7012,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,How strength may serve for purity is shown
7013,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,When he himself can scourge to make it clean.
7014,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Withal his pitch of pride would not disown
7015,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A sober world that walks the balanced mean
7016,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Between its tempters, rarely overthrown:"
7017,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And such at times his army’s march has been.
7018,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
7019,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Near is he to great Nature in the thought
7020,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Each changing Season intimately saith,"
7021,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That nought save apparition knows the death;
7022,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To the God-lighted mind of man ’tis nought.
7023,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,She counts not loss a word of any weight;
7024,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,It may befal his passions and his greeds
7025,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To lose their treasures, like the vein that bleeds,"
7026,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,But life gone breathless will she reinstate.
7027,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
7028,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Close on the heart of Earth his bosom beats,"
7029,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"When he the mandate lodged in it obeys,"
7030,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Alive to breast a future wrapped in haze,"
7031,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Strike camp, and onward, like the wind’s cloud-fleets."
7032,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Unresting she, unresting he, from change"
7033,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To change, as rain of cloud, as fruit of rain;"
7034,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"She feels her blood-tree throbbing in her grain,"
7035,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Yet skyward branched, with loftier mark and range."
7036,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
7037,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"No miracle the sprout of wheat from clod,"
7038,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"She knows, nor growth of man in grisly brute;"
7039,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But he, the flower at head and soil at root,"
7040,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Is miracle, guides he the brute to God."
7041,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And that way seems he bound; that way the road,"
7042,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"With his dark-lantern mind, unled, alone,"
7043,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Wearifully through forest-tracts unsown,"
7044,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He travels, urged by some internal goad."
7045,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
7046,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Dares he behold the thing he is, what thing"
7047,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He would become is in his mind its child;
7048,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Astir, demanding birth to light and wing;"
7049,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"For battle prompt, by pleasure unbeguiled."
7050,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"So moves he forth in faith, if he has made"
7051,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His mind God’s temple, dedicate to truth."
7052,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Earth’s nourishing delights, no more gainsaid,"
7053,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He tastes, as doth the bridegroom rich in youth."
7054,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Then knows he Love, that beckons and controls;"
7055,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The star of sky upon his footway cast;
7056,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Then match in him who holds his tempters fast,"
7057,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The body’s love and mind’s, whereof the soul’s."
7058,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Then Earth her man for woman finds at last,"
7059,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To speed the pair unto her goal of goals.
