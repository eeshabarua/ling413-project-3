850,THE SETTING OF THE WATCH,The ship’s track brightened to a mile-broad sweep;
851,THE SETTING OF THE WATCH,"The mate there felt her pulse, and eyed the spars:"
852,THE SETTING OF THE WATCH,South-west by south she staggered under the stars.
853,THE SETTING OF THE WATCH,

857,THE WATCH BELOW,THE WATCH BELOW
858,THE WATCH BELOW,
859,THE WATCH BELOW,
860,THE WATCH BELOW,Down in his bunk the Dauber lay awake
861,THE WATCH BELOW,Thinking of his unfitness for the sea.
862,THE WATCH BELOW,"Each failure, each derision, each mistake,"
863,THE WATCH BELOW,There in the life not made for such as he;
864,THE WATCH BELOW,"A morning grim with trouble sure to be,"
865,THE WATCH BELOW,"A noon of pain from failure, and a night"
866,THE WATCH BELOW,Bitter with men’s contemning and despite.
867,THE WATCH BELOW,
868,THE WATCH BELOW,"This in the first beginning, the green leaf,"
869,THE WATCH BELOW,Still in the Trades before bad weather fell;
870,THE WATCH BELOW,What harvest would he reap of hate and grief
871,THE WATCH BELOW,When the loud Horn made every life a hell?
872,THE WATCH BELOW,"When the sick ship lay over, clanging her bell,"
873,THE WATCH BELOW,"And no time came for painting or for drawing,"
874,THE WATCH BELOW,"But all hands fought, and icy death came clawing?"
875,THE WATCH BELOW,
876,THE WATCH BELOW,"The green bunk curtains moved, the brass rings clicked,"
877,THE WATCH BELOW,"The Cook cursed in his sleep, turning and turning,"
878,THE WATCH BELOW,"The moonbeam’s moving finger touched and picked,"
879,THE WATCH BELOW,And all the stars in all the sky were burning.
880,THE WATCH BELOW,"“This is the art I’ve come for, and am learning,"
881,THE WATCH BELOW,The sea and ships and men and travelling things.
882,THE WATCH BELOW,"It is most proud, whatever pain it brings.”"
883,THE WATCH BELOW,
884,THE WATCH BELOW,He leaned upon his arm and watched the light
885,THE WATCH BELOW,Sliding and fading to the steady roll;
886,THE WATCH BELOW,"This he would some day paint, the ship at night,"
887,THE WATCH BELOW,And sleeping seamen tired to the soul;
888,THE WATCH BELOW,"The space below the bunks as black as coal,"
889,THE WATCH BELOW,"Gleams upon chests, upon the unlit lamp,"
890,THE WATCH BELOW,"The ranging door-hook, and the locker clamp."
891,THE WATCH BELOW,
892,THE WATCH BELOW,"This he would paint, and that, and all these scenes,"
893,THE WATCH BELOW,"And proud ships carrying on, and men their minds,"
894,THE WATCH BELOW,"And blues of rollers toppling into greens,"
895,THE WATCH BELOW,"And shattering into white that bursts and blinds,"
896,THE WATCH BELOW,"And scattering ships running erect like hinds,"
897,THE WATCH BELOW,And men in oilskins beating down a sail
898,THE WATCH BELOW,"High on the yellow yard, in snow, in hail,"
899,THE WATCH BELOW,
900,THE WATCH BELOW,With faces ducked down from the slanting drive
901,THE WATCH BELOW,"Of half-thawed hail mixed with half-frozen spray,"
902,THE WATCH BELOW,"The roaring canvas, like a thing alive,"
903,THE WATCH BELOW,"Shaking the mast, knocking their hands away,"
904,THE WATCH BELOW,"The foot-ropes jerking to the tug and sway,"
905,THE WATCH BELOW,"The savage eyes salt-reddened at the rims,"
906,THE WATCH BELOW,And icicles on the south-wester brims.
907,THE WATCH BELOW,
908,THE WATCH BELOW,"And sunnier scenes would grow under his brush,"
909,THE WATCH BELOW,"The tropic dawn with all things dropping dew,"
910,THE WATCH BELOW,"The darkness and the wonder and the hush,"
911,THE WATCH BELOW,The insensate grey before the marvel grew;
912,THE WATCH BELOW,"Then the veil lifted from the trembling blue,"
913,THE WATCH BELOW,"The walls of sky burst in, the flower, the rose,"
914,THE WATCH BELOW,All the expanse of heaven a mind that glows.
915,THE WATCH BELOW,
916,THE WATCH BELOW,"He turned out of his bunk; the Cook still tossed,"
917,THE WATCH BELOW,"One of the other two spoke in his sleep,"
918,THE WATCH BELOW,A cockroach scuttled where the moonbeam crossed;
919,THE WATCH BELOW,"Outside there was the ship, the night, the deep."
920,THE WATCH BELOW,"“It is worth while,” the youth said; “I will keep"
921,THE WATCH BELOW,"To my resolve, I’ll learn to paint all this."
922,THE WATCH BELOW,"My Lord, my God, how beautiful it is!”"
923,THE WATCH BELOW,
924,THE WATCH BELOW,"Outside was the ship’s rush to the wind’s hurry,"
925,THE WATCH BELOW,"A resonant wire-hum from every rope,"
926,THE WATCH BELOW,"The broadening bow-wash in a fiery flurry,"
927,THE WATCH BELOW,"The leaning masts in their majestic slope,"
928,THE WATCH BELOW,And all things strange with moonlight: filled with hope
929,THE WATCH BELOW,"By all that beauty going as man bade,"
930,THE WATCH BELOW,He turned and slept in peace. Eight bells were made.

935,THE HORN,THE HORN
936,THE HORN,
937,THE HORN,
938,THE HORN,Even now they shifted suits of sails; they bent
939,THE HORN,The storm-suit ready for the expected time;
940,THE HORN,The mighty wester that the Plate had lent
941,THE HORN,Had brought them far into the wintry clime.
942,THE HORN,"At dawn, out of the shadow, there was rime,"
943,THE HORN,"The dim Magellan Clouds were frosty clear,"
944,THE HORN,"The wind had edge, the testing-time was near."
945,THE HORN,
946,THE HORN,And then he wondered if the tales were lies
947,THE HORN,"Told by old hands to terrify the new,"
948,THE HORN,"For, since the ship left England, only twice"
949,THE HORN,"Had there been need to start a sheet or clew,"
950,THE HORN,"Then only royals, for an hour or two,"
951,THE HORN,"And no seas broke aboard, nor was it cold."
952,THE HORN,What were these gales of which the stories told?
953,THE HORN,
954,THE HORN,The thought went by. He had heard the Bosun tell
955,THE HORN,"Too often, and too fiercely, not to know"
956,THE HORN,That being off the Horn in June is hell:
957,THE HORN,"Hell of continual toil in ice and snow,"
958,THE HORN,Frostbitten hell in which the westers blow
959,THE HORN,"Shrieking for days on end, in which the seas"
960,THE HORN,Gulf the starved seamen till their marrows freeze.
961,THE HORN,
962,THE HORN,"Such was the weather he might look to find,"
963,THE HORN,Such was the work expected: there remained
964,THE HORN,"Firmly to set his teeth, resolve his mind,"
965,THE HORN,"And be the first, however much it pained,"
966,THE HORN,"And bring his honour round the Horn unstained,"
967,THE HORN,"And win his mates’ respect; and thence, untainted,"
968,THE HORN,Be ranked as man however much he painted.
969,THE HORN,
970,THE HORN,He drew deep breath; a gantline swayed aloft
971,THE HORN,"A lower topsail, hard with rope and leather,"
972,THE HORN,Such as men’s frozen fingers fight with oft
973,THE HORN,Below the Ramirez in Cape Horn weather.
974,THE HORN,"The arms upon the yard hove all together,"
975,THE HORN,Lighting the head along; a thought occurred
976,THE HORN,Within the painter’s brain like a bright bird:
977,THE HORN,
978,THE HORN,"That this, and so much like it, of man’s toil,"
979,THE HORN,"Compassed by naked manhood in strange places,"
980,THE HORN,"Was all heroic, but outside the coil"
981,THE HORN,Within which modern art gleams or grimaces;
982,THE HORN,That if he drew that line of sailors’ faces
983,THE HORN,"Sweating the sail, their passionate play and change,"
984,THE HORN,"It would be new, and wonderful, and strange."
985,THE HORN,
986,THE HORN,That that was what his work meant; it would be
987,THE HORN,"A training in new vision, a revealing"
988,THE HORN,"Of passionate men in battle with the sea,"
989,THE HORN,"High on an unseen stage, shaking and reeling;"
990,THE HORN,"And men through him would understand their feeling,"
991,THE HORN,"Their might, their misery, their tragic power,"
992,THE HORN,And all by suffering pain a little hour;
993,THE HORN,
994,THE HORN,"High on the yard with them, feeling their pain,"
995,THE HORN,Battling with them; and it had not been done.
996,THE HORN,"He was a door to new worlds in the brain,"
997,THE HORN,"A window opening letting in the sun,"
998,THE HORN,"A voice saying, “Thus is bread fetched and ports won,"
999,THE HORN,And life lived out at sea where men exist
1000,THE HORN,Solely by man’s strong brain and sturdy wrist.”
1001,THE HORN,
1002,THE HORN,"So he decided, as he cleaned his brasses,"
1003,THE HORN,"Hearing without, aloft, the curse, the shout"
1004,THE HORN,"Where the taut gantline passes and repasses,"
1005,THE HORN,Heaving new topsails to be lighted out.
1006,THE HORN,"It was most proud, however self might doubt,"
1007,THE HORN,To share man’s tragic toil and paint it true.
1008,THE HORN,He took the offered Fate: this he would do.
1009,THE HORN,
1010,THE HORN,"That night the snow fell between six and seven,"
1011,THE HORN,"A little feathery fall so light, so dry,"
1012,THE HORN,"An aimless dust out of a confused heaven,"
1013,THE HORN,Upon an air no steadier than a sigh;
1014,THE HORN,The powder dusted down and wandered by
1015,THE HORN,"So purposeless, so many, and so cold,"
1016,THE HORN,"Then died, and the wind ceased and the ship rolled."
1017,THE HORN,
1018,THE HORN,"Rolled till she clanged, rolled till the brain was tired,"
1019,THE HORN,"Marking the acme of the heaves, the pause"
1020,THE HORN,"While the sea-beauty rested and respired,"
1021,THE HORN,Drinking great draughts of roller at her hawse.
1022,THE HORN,Flutters of snow came aimless upon flaws.
1023,THE HORN,"“Lock up your paints,” the Mate said, speaking light:"
1024,THE HORN,“This is the Horn; you’ll join my watch to-night!”

1029,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND
1030,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1031,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1032,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,All through the windless night the clipper rolled
1033,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,In a great swell with oily gradual heaves
1034,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Which rolled her down until her time-bells tolled,"
1035,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Clang, and the weltering water moaned like beeves."
1036,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The thundering rattle of slatting shook the sheaves,"
1037,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Startles of water made the swing ports gush,"
1038,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The sea was moaning and sighing and saying “Hush!”
1039,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1040,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,It was all black and starless. Peering down
1041,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Into the water, trying to pierce the gloom,"
1042,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"One saw a dim, smooth, oily glitter of brown"
1043,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Heaving and dying away and leaving room
1044,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,For yet another. Like the march of doom
1045,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Came those great powers of marching silences;
1046,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Then fog came down, dead-cold, and hid the seas."
1047,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1048,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,They set the Dauber to the foghorn. There
1049,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"He stood upon the poop, making to sound"
1050,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Out of the pump the sailors’ nasal blare,"
1051,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Listening lest ice should make the note resound.
1052,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,She bayed there like a solitary hound
1053,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Lost in a covert; all the watch she bayed.
1054,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The fog, come closelier down, no answer made."
1055,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1056,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Denser it grew, until the ship was lost."
1057,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The elemental hid her; she was merged
1058,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"In mufflings of dark death, like a man’s ghost,"
1059,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"New to the change of death, yet thither urged."
1060,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Then from the hidden waters something surged--
1061,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Mournful, despairing, great, greater than speech,"
1062,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,A noise like one slow wave on a still beach.
1063,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1064,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Mournful, and then again mournful, and still"
1065,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Out of the night that mighty voice arose;
1066,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The Dauber at his foghorn felt the thrill.
1067,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Who rode that desolate sea? What forms were those?
1068,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Mournful, from things defeated, in the throes"
1069,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Of memory of some conquered hunting-ground,"
1070,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Out of the night of death arose the sound.
1071,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1072,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,“Whales!” said the mate. They stayed there all night long
1073,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Answering the horn. Out of the night they spoke,"
1074,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Defeated creatures who had suffered wrong,"
1075,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,But were still noble underneath the stroke.
1076,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,They filled the darkness when the Dauber woke;
1077,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The men came peering to the rail to hear,"
1078,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"And the sea sighed, and the fog rose up sheer."
1079,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1080,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"So the night past, but then no morning broke--"
1081,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Only a something showed that night was dead.
1082,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"A sea-bird, cackling like a devil, spoke,"
1083,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,And the fog drew away and hung like lead.
1084,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Like mighty cliffs it shaped, sullen and red;"
1085,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Like glowering gods at watch it did appear,"
1086,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"And sometimes drew away, and then drew near."
1087,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1088,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Like islands, and like chasms, and like hell,"
1089,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"But always mighty and red, gloomy and ruddy,"
1090,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Shutting the visible sea in like a well;
1091,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Slow heaving in vast ripples, blank and muddy,"
1092,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Where the sun should have risen it streaked bloody.
1093,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The day was still-born; all the sea-fowl scattering
1094,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Splashed the still water, mewing, hovering, clattering."
1095,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1096,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Then Polar snow came down little and light,"
1097,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Till all the sky was hidden by the small,"
1098,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Most multitudinous drift of dirty white
1099,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Tumbling and wavering down and covering all;
1100,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Covering the sky, the sea, the clipper tall,"
1101,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Furring the ropes with white, casing the mast,"
1102,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Coming on no known air, but blowing past."
1103,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1104,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"And all the air seemed full of gradual moan,"
1105,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,As though in those cloud-chasms the horns were blowing
1106,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The mort for gods cast out and overthrown,"
1107,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Or for the eyeless sun plucked out and going.
1108,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Slow the low gradual moan came in the snowing;
1109,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The Dauber felt the prelude had begun.
1110,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The snowstorm fluttered by; he saw the sun
1111,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Show and pass by, gleam from one towering prison"
1112,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Into another, vaster and more grim,"
1113,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Which in dull crags of darkness had arisen
1114,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,To muffle-to a final door on him.
1115,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The gods upon the dull crags lowered dim,"
1116,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The pigeons chattered, quarrelling in the track."
1117,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,In the south-west the dimness dulled to black.
1118,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1119,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Then came the cry of “Call all hands on deck!”
1120,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The Dauber knew its meaning; it was come:
1121,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Cape Horn, that tramples beauty into wreck,"
1122,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,And crumples steel and smites the strong man dumb.
1123,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Down clattered flying kites and staysails: some
1124,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Sang out in quick, high calls; the fairleads skirled,"
1125,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,And from the south-west came the end of the world.
1126,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1127,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1128,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
1129,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,

1140,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,
1141,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,Blowing most pitiless cold out of clear sky
1142,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,The wind roared all night long; and all night through
1143,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"The green seas on the deck went washing by,"
1144,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,Flooding the half-deck; bitter hard it blew.
1145,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,But little of it all the Dauber knew;

1148,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,

1160,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"Out on the sea, in ships, with wandering men."
1161,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,In many ways Death puts us into pen.
1162,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,The reefers came down tired and looked and slept.
1163,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,Below the skylight little dribbles crept.
1164,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,
1165,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"Along the painted woodwork, glistening, slow,"
1166,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"Following the roll and dripping, never fast,"
1167,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"But dripping on the quiet form below,"
1168,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,Like passing time talking to time long past.
1169,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"And all night long “Ai, ai!” went the wind’s blast,"

1172,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,
1173,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"At dawn they sewed him up, and at eight bells"

1176,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,That flung his carriers over in their sweep.
1177,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"They laid an old red ensign on the heap,"
1178,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"And all hands stood bare-headed, stooping, swaying,"
1179,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,Washed by the sea while the old man was praying
1180,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,
1181,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,Out of a borrowed prayer-book. At a sign
1182,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,They twitched the ensign back and tipped the grating.
1183,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,A creamier bubbling broke the bubbling brine.
1184,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,The muffled figure tilted to the weighting;
1185,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"It dwindled slowly down, slowly gyrating."
1186,WE THEREFORE COMMIT OUR BROTHER.,"Some craned to see; it dimmed, it disappeared;"

1245,I,I
1246,I,
1247,I,Between the barren pasture and the wood
1248,I,"There is a patch of poultry-stricken grass,"
1249,I,"Where, in old time, Ryemeadows’ Farmhouse stood,"
1250,I,And human fate brought tragic things to pass.
1251,I,"A spring comes bubbling up there, cold as glass,"
1252,I,"It bubbles down, crusting the leaves with lime,"
1253,I,Babbling the self-same song that it has sung through time.
1254,I,
1255,I,"Ducks gobble at the selvage of the brook,"
1256,I,"But still it slips away, the cold hill-spring,"
1257,I,Past the Ryemeadows’ lonely woodland nook
1258,I,"Where many a stubble gray-goose preens her wing,"
1259,I,"On, by the woodland side. You hear it sing"
1260,I,"Past the lone copse where poachers set their wires,"
1261,I,Past the green hill once grim with sacrificial fires.
1262,I,
1263,I,"Another water joins it; then it turns,"
1264,I,"Runs through the Ponton Wood, still turning west,"
1265,I,"Past foxgloves, Canterbury bells, and ferns,"
1266,I,"And many a blackbird’s, many a thrush’s nest;"
1267,I,"The cattle tread it there; then, with a zest"
1268,I,"It sparkles out, babbling its pretty chatter"
1269,I,"Through Foxholes Farm, where it gives white-faced cattle water."
1270,I,
1271,I,"Under the road it runs, and now it slips"
1272,I,"Past the great ploughland, babbling, drop and linn,"
1273,I,"To the moss’d stumps of elm trees which it lips,"
1274,I,And blackberry-bramble-trails where eddies spin.
1275,I,"Then, on its left, some short-grassed fields begin,"
1276,I,"Red-clayed and pleasant, which the young spring fills"
1277,I,With the never-quiet joy of dancing daffodils.
1278,I,
1279,I,There are three fields where daffodils are found;
1280,I,The grass is dotted blue-gray with their leaves;
1281,I,Their nodding beauty shakes along the ground
1282,I,Up to a fir-clump shutting out the eaves
1283,I,Of an old farm where always the wind grieves
1284,I,"High in the fir boughs, moaning; people call"
1285,I,"This farm The Roughs, but some call it the Poor Maid’s Hall."
1286,I,
1287,I,"There, when the first green shoots of tender corn"
1288,I,Show on the plough; when the first drift of white
1289,I,"Stars the black branches of the spiky thorn,"
1290,I,"And afternoons are warm and evenings light,"
1291,I,"The shivering daffodils do take delight,"
1292,I,"Shaking beside the brook, and grass comes green,"
1293,I,And blue dog-violets come and glistening celandine.
1294,I,
1295,I,"And there the pickers come, picking for town"
1296,I,Those dancing daffodils; all day they pick;
1297,I,"Hard-featured women, weather-beaten brown,"
1298,I,"Or swarthy-red, the colour of old brick."
1299,I,At noon they break their meats under the rick.
1300,I,The smoke of all three farms lifts blue in air
1301,I,As though man’s passionate mind had never suffered there.
1302,I,
1303,I,"And sometimes as they rest an old man comes,"
1304,I,"Shepherd or carter, to the hedgerow-side,"
1305,I,"And looks upon their gangrel tribe, and hums,"
1306,I,And thinks all gone to wreck since master died;
1307,I,And sighs over a passionate harvest-tide
1308,I,"Which Death’s red sickle reaped under those hills,"
1309,I,"There, in the quiet fields among the daffodils."

1314,THE RIVER.,THE RIVER.
1315,THE RIVER.,
1316,THE RIVER.,
1317,THE RIVER.,The steaming river loitered like old blood
1318,THE RIVER.,"On which the tugboat bearing Michael beat,"
1319,THE RIVER.,Past whitened horse bones sticking in the mud.
1320,THE RIVER.,The reed stems looked like metal in the heat.
1321,THE RIVER.,"Then the banks fell away, and there were neat;"
1322,THE RIVER.,Red herds of sullen cattle drifting slow.
1323,THE RIVER.,"A fish leaped, making rings, making the dead blood flow."
1324,THE RIVER.,
1325,THE RIVER.,"Wormed hard-wood piles were driv’n in the river bank,"
1326,THE RIVER.,The steamer threshed alongside with sick screws
1327,THE RIVER.,Churning the mud below her till it stank;
1328,THE RIVER.,Big gassy butcher-bubbles burst on the ooze.
1329,THE RIVER.,There Michael went ashore; as glad to lose
1330,THE RIVER.,"One not a native there, the Gauchos flung"
1331,THE RIVER.,"His broken gear ashore, one waved, a bell was rung."
1332,THE RIVER.,
1333,THE RIVER.,"The bowfast was cast off, the screw revolved,"
1334,THE RIVER.,Making a bloodier bubbling; rattling rope
1335,THE RIVER.,"Fell to the hatch, the engine’s tune resolved"
1336,THE RIVER.,Into its steadier beat of rise and slope;
1337,THE RIVER.,The steamer went her way; and Michael’s hope
1338,THE RIVER.,Died as she lessened; he was there alone.
1339,THE RIVER.,The lowing of the cattle made a gradual moan.
1340,THE RIVER.,
1341,THE RIVER.,"He thought of Mary, but the thought was dim;"
1342,THE RIVER.,"That was another life, lived long before."
1343,THE RIVER.,His mind was in new worlds which altered him.
1344,THE RIVER.,The startling present left no room for more.
1345,THE RIVER.,"The sullen river lipped, the sky, the shore"
1346,THE RIVER.,"Were vaster than of old, and lonely, lonely."
1347,THE RIVER.,Sky and low hills of grass and moaning cattle only.

1352,THE RETURN.,THE RETURN.
1353,THE RETURN.,
1354,THE RETURN.,
1355,THE RETURN.,"Soon he was at the Foxholes, at the place"
1356,THE RETURN.,"Whither, from over sea, his heart had turned"
1357,THE RETURN.,Often at evening-ends in times of grace.
1358,THE RETURN.,But little outward change his eye discerned;
1359,THE RETURN.,"A red rose at her bedroom window burned,"
1360,THE RETURN.,Just as before. Even as of old the wasps
1361,THE RETURN.,Poised at the yellow plums; the gate creaked on its hasps
1362,THE RETURN.,
1363,THE RETURN.,And the white fantails sidled on the roof
1364,THE RETURN.,"Just as before; their pink feet, even as of old,"
1365,THE RETURN.,Printed the frosty morning’s rime with proof.
1366,THE RETURN.,Still the zew-tallat’s thatch was green with mould;
1367,THE RETURN.,The apples on the withered boughs were gold.
1368,THE RETURN.,"Men and the times were changed: “And I,” said he,"
1369,THE RETURN.,"“Will go and not return, since she is not for me."
1370,THE RETURN.,
1371,THE RETURN.,"“I’ll go, for it would be a scurvy thing"
1372,THE RETURN.,"To spoil her marriage, and besides, she cares"
1373,THE RETURN.,For that half-priest she married with the ring.
1374,THE RETURN.,"Small joy for me in seeing how she wears,"
1375,THE RETURN.,Or seeing what he takes and what she shares.
1376,THE RETURN.,"That beauty and those ways: she had such ways,"
1377,THE RETURN.,There in the daffodils in those old April days.
1378,THE RETURN.,
1379,THE RETURN.,"So with an impulse of good will he turned,"
1380,THE RETURN.,Leaving that place of daffodils; the road
1381,THE RETURN.,Was paven sharp with memories which burned;
1382,THE RETURN.,He trod them strongly under as he strode.
1383,THE RETURN.,At the Green Turning’s forge the furnace glowed;
1384,THE RETURN.,Red dithying sparks flew from the crumpled soft
1385,THE RETURN.,Fold from the fire’s heart; down clanged the hammers oft.
1386,THE RETURN.,
1387,THE RETURN.,"That was a bitter place to pass, for there"
1388,THE RETURN.,"Mary and he had often, often stayed"
1389,THE RETURN.,To watch the horseshoe growing in the glare.
1390,THE RETURN.,It was a tryst in childhood when they strayed.
1391,THE RETURN.,There was a stile beside the forge; he laid
1392,THE RETURN.,"His elbows on it, leaning, looking down."
1393,THE RETURN.,The river-valley stretched with great trees turning brown.
1394,THE RETURN.,
1395,THE RETURN.,"Infinite, too, because it reached the sky,"
1396,THE RETURN.,And distant spires arose and distant smoke;
1397,THE RETURN.,The whiteness on the blue went stilly by;
1398,THE RETURN.,Only the clinking forge the stillness broke.
1399,THE RETURN.,"Ryemeadows brook was there; The Roughs, the oak"
1400,THE RETURN.,Where the White Woman walked; the black firs showed
1401,THE RETURN.,"Around the Occleve homestead, Mary’s new abode."
1402,THE RETURN.,
1403,THE RETURN.,"A long, long time he gazed at that fair place,"
1404,THE RETURN.,So well remembered from of old; he sighed.
1405,THE RETURN.,"“I will go down and look upon her face,"
1406,THE RETURN.,"See her again, whatever may betide."
1407,THE RETURN.,"Hell is my future; I shall soon have died,"
1408,THE RETURN.,But I will take to hell one memory more;
1409,THE RETURN.,She shall not see nor know; I shall be gone before;
1410,THE RETURN.,
1411,THE RETURN.,"“Before they turn the dogs upon me, even."
1412,THE RETURN.,I do not mean to speak; but only see.
1413,THE RETURN.,Even the devil gets a peep at heaven;
1414,THE RETURN.,One peep at her shall come to hell with me;
1415,THE RETURN.,"One peep at her, no matter what may be.”"
1416,THE RETURN.,He crossed the stile and hurried down the slope.
1417,THE RETURN.,Remembered trees and hedges gave a zest to hope.
1418,THE RETURN.,
1419,THE RETURN.,*       *       *       *       *
1420,THE RETURN.,
1421,THE RETURN.,A low brick wall with privet shrubs beyond
1422,THE RETURN.,Ringed in The Roughs upon the side he neared;
1423,THE RETURN.,Eastward some bramble bushes cloaked the pond;
1424,THE RETURN.,Westward was barley-stubble not yet cleared.
1425,THE RETURN.,He thrust aside the privet boughs and peered.
1426,THE RETURN.,The drooping fir trees let their darkness trail
1427,THE RETURN.,Black like a pirate’s masts bound under easy sail.
1428,THE RETURN.,
1429,THE RETURN.,The garden with its autumn flowers was there;
1430,THE RETURN.,Few that his wayward memory linked with her.
1431,THE RETURN.,"Summer had burnt the summer flowers bare,"
1432,THE RETURN.,But honey-hunting bees still made a stir.
1433,THE RETURN.,"Sprigs were still bluish on the lavender,"
1434,THE RETURN.,"And bluish daisies budded, bright flies poised;"
1435,THE RETURN.,The wren upon the tree-stump carolled cheery-voiced.
1436,THE RETURN.,
1437,THE RETURN.,"He could not see her there. Windows were wide,"
1438,THE RETURN.,"Late wasps were cruising, and the curtains shook."
1439,THE RETURN.,"Smoke, like the house’s breathing, floated, sighed;"
1440,THE RETURN.,Among the trembling firs strange ways it took.
1441,THE RETURN.,But still no Mary’s presence blessed his look;
1442,THE RETURN.,"The house was still as if deserted, hushed."
1443,THE RETURN.,Faint fragrance hung about it as if herbs were crushed.
1444,THE RETURN.,
1445,THE RETURN.,Fragrance that gave his memory’s guard a hint
1446,THE RETURN.,"Of times long past, of reapers in the corn,"
1447,THE RETURN.,"Bruising with heavy boots the stalks of mint,"
1448,THE RETURN.,When first the berry reddens on the thorn.
1449,THE RETURN.,Memories of her that fragrance brought. Forlorn
1450,THE RETURN.,That vigil of the watching outcast grew;
1451,THE RETURN.,"He crept towards the kitchen, sheltered by a yew."
1452,THE RETURN.,
1453,THE RETURN.,The windows of the kitchen opened wide.
1454,THE RETURN.,Again the fragrance came; a woman spoke;
1455,THE RETURN.,Old Mrs. Occleve talked to one inside.
1456,THE RETURN.,A smell of cooking filled a gust of smoke.
1457,THE RETURN.,"Then fragrance once again, for herbs were broke;"
1458,THE RETURN.,Pourri was being made; the listener heard
1459,THE RETURN.,"Things lifted and laid down, bruised into sweetness, stirred."
1460,THE RETURN.,
1461,THE RETURN.,While an old woman made remarks to one
1462,THE RETURN.,Who was not the beloved: Michael learned
1463,THE RETURN.,"That Roger’s wife at Upton had a son,"
1464,THE RETURN.,And that the red geraniums should be turned;
1465,THE RETURN.,"A hen was missing, and a rick was burned;"
1466,THE RETURN.,Our Lord commanded patience; here it broke;
1467,THE RETURN.,"The window closed, it made the kitchen chimney smoke."
1468,THE RETURN.,
1469,THE RETURN.,Steps clacked on flagstones to the outer door;
1470,THE RETURN.,"A dairymaid, whom he remembered well,"
1471,THE RETURN.,"Lined, now, with age, and grayer than before,"
1472,THE RETURN.,Rang a cracked cow-bell for the dinner-bell.
1473,THE RETURN.,He saw the dining-room; he could not tell
1474,THE RETURN.,If Mary were within: inly he knew
1475,THE RETURN.,"That she was coming now, that she would be in blue."
1476,THE RETURN.,
1477,THE RETURN.,"Blue with a silver locket at the throat,"
1478,THE RETURN.,"And that she would be there, within there, near,"
1479,THE RETURN.,"With the little blushes that he knew by rote,"
1480,THE RETURN.,"And the gray eyes so steadfast and so dear,"
1481,THE RETURN.,"The voice, pure like the nature, true and clear,"
1482,THE RETURN.,Speaking to her belov’d within the room.
1483,THE RETURN.,"The gate clicked, Lion came: the outcast hugged the gloom,"
1484,THE RETURN.,
1485,THE RETURN.,"Watching intently from below the boughs,"
1486,THE RETURN.,"While Lion cleared his riding-boots of clay,"
1487,THE RETURN.,Eyed the high clouds and went within the house.
1488,THE RETURN.,"His eyes looked troubled, and his hair looked gray."
1489,THE RETURN.,Dinner began within with much to say.
1490,THE RETURN.,Old Occleve roared aloud at his own joke.
1491,THE RETURN.,"Mary, it seemed, was gone; the loved voice never spoke."
1492,THE RETURN.,
1493,THE RETURN.,Nor could her lover see her from the yew;
1494,THE RETURN.,"She was not there at table; she was ill,"
1495,THE RETURN.,"Ill, or away perhaps--he wished he knew."
1496,THE RETURN.,"Away, perhaps, for Occleve bellowed still."
1497,THE RETURN.,"“If sick,” he thought, “the maid or Lion will"
1498,THE RETURN.,Take food to her.” He watched; the dinner ended.
1499,THE RETURN.,"The staircase was not used; none climbed it, none descended."
1500,THE RETURN.,
1501,THE RETURN.,"“Not here,” he thought; but wishing to be sure,"
1502,THE RETURN.,"He waited till the Occleves went to field,"
1503,THE RETURN.,"Then followed, round the house, another lure,"
1504,THE RETURN.,Using the well-known privet as his shield.
1505,THE RETURN.,He meant to run a risk; his heart was steeled.
1506,THE RETURN.,He knew of old which bedroom would be hers;
1507,THE RETURN.,He crouched upon the north front in among the firs.
1508,THE RETURN.,
1509,THE RETURN.,"The house stared at him with its red-brick blank,"
1510,THE RETURN.,"Its vacant window-eyes; its open door,"
1511,THE RETURN.,"With old wrought bridle ring-hooks at each flank,"
1512,THE RETURN.,Swayed on a creaking hinge as the wind bore.
1513,THE RETURN.,"Nothing had changed; the house was as before,"
1514,THE RETURN.,"The dull red brick, the windows sealed or wide:"
1515,THE RETURN.,"“I will go in,” he said. He rose and stepped inside."
1516,THE RETURN.,
1517,THE RETURN.,None could have seen him coming; all was still;
1518,THE RETURN.,He listened in the doorway for a sign.
1519,THE RETURN.,"Above, a rafter creaked, a stir, a thrill"
1520,THE RETURN.,"Moved, till the frames clacked on the picture line."
1521,THE RETURN.,"“Old Mother Occleve sleeps, the servants dine,”"
1522,THE RETURN.,"He muttered, listening. “Hush.” A silence brooded."
1523,THE RETURN.,Far off the kitchen dinner clattered; he intruded.
1524,THE RETURN.,
1525,THE RETURN.,"Still, to his right, the best room door was locked."
1526,THE RETURN.,Another door was at his left; he stayed.
1527,THE RETURN.,"Within, a stately timepiece ticked and tocked"
1528,THE RETURN.,To one who slumbered breathing deep; it made
1529,THE RETURN.,An image of Time’s going and man’s trade.
1530,THE RETURN.,"He looked: Old Mother Occleve lay asleep,"
1531,THE RETURN.,"Hands crossed upon her knitting, rosy, breathing deep."
1532,THE RETURN.,
1533,THE RETURN.,He tiptoed up the stairs which creaked and cracked.
1534,THE RETURN.,"The landing creaked; the shut doors, painted gray,"
1535,THE RETURN.,"Loomed, as if shutting in some dreadful act."
1536,THE RETURN.,The nodding frames seemed ready to betray.
1537,THE RETURN.,"The east room had been closed in Michael’s day,"
1538,THE RETURN.,Being the best; but now he guessed it hers;
1539,THE RETURN.,"The fields of daffodils lay next it, past the firs."
1540,THE RETURN.,
1541,THE RETURN.,"Just as he reached the landing, Lion cried,"
1542,THE RETURN.,"Somewhere below, “I’ll get it.” Lion’s feet"
1543,THE RETURN.,"Struck on the flagstones with a hasty stride,"
1544,THE RETURN.,"“He’s coming up,” thought Michael, “we shall meet,”"
1545,THE RETURN.,"He snatched the nearest door for his retreat,"
1546,THE RETURN.,"Opened with thieves’ swift silence, dared not close,"
1547,THE RETURN.,"But stood within, behind it. Lion’s footsteps rose,"
1548,THE RETURN.,
1549,THE RETURN.,"Running two steps at once, while Michael stood,"
1550,THE RETURN.,"Not breathing, only knowing that the room"
1551,THE RETURN.,"Was someone’s bedroom smelling of old wood,"
1552,THE RETURN.,Hung with engravings of the day of doom.
1553,THE RETURN.,"The footsteps stopped; and Lion called, to whom?"
1554,THE RETURN.,"A gentle question, tapping at a door,"
1555,THE RETURN.,"And Michael shifted feet, and creakings took the floor."
1556,THE RETURN.,
1557,THE RETURN.,"The footsteps recommenced, a door-catch clacked;"
1558,THE RETURN.,Within an eastern room the footsteps passed.
1559,THE RETURN.,"Drawers were pulled loudly open and ransacked,"
1560,THE RETURN.,Chattels were thrust aside and overcast.
1561,THE RETURN.,What could the thing be that he sought? At last
1562,THE RETURN.,"His voice said, “Here it is.” The wormèd floor"
1563,THE RETURN.,Creaked with returning footsteps down the corridor.
1564,THE RETURN.,
1565,THE RETURN.,"The footsteps came as though the walker read,"
1566,THE RETURN.,Or added rows of figures by the way;
1567,THE RETURN.,There was much hesitation in the tread;
1568,THE RETURN.,"Lion seemed pondering which, to go or stay;"
1569,THE RETURN.,"Then, seeing the door, which covered Michael, sway,"
1570,THE RETURN.,He swiftly crossed and shut it. “Always one
1571,THE RETURN.,"For order,” Michael muttered; “Now be swift, my son.”"
1572,THE RETURN.,
1573,THE RETURN.,The action seemed to break the walker’s mood;
1574,THE RETURN.,"The footsteps passed downstairs, along the hall,"
1575,THE RETURN.,Out at the door and off towards the wood.
1576,THE RETURN.,"“Gone,” Michael muttered. “Now to hazard all.”"
1577,THE RETURN.,"Outside, the frames still nodded on the wall."
1578,THE RETURN.,Michael stepped swiftly up the floor to try
1579,THE RETURN.,The door where Lion tapped and waited for reply.
1580,THE RETURN.,
1581,THE RETURN.,It was the eastmost of the rooms which look
1582,THE RETURN.,Over the fields of daffodils; the bound
1583,THE RETURN.,"Scanned from its windows is Ryemeadows brook,"
1584,THE RETURN.,Banked by gnarled apple trees and rising ground.
1585,THE RETURN.,"Most gently Michael tapped; he heard no sound,"
1586,THE RETURN.,Only the blind-pull tapping with the wind;
1587,THE RETURN.,The kitchen-door was opened; kitchen-clatter dinned.
1588,THE RETURN.,
1589,THE RETURN.,"A woman walked along the hall below,"
1590,THE RETURN.,"Humming; a maid, he judged; the footsteps died,"
1591,THE RETURN.,"Listening intently still, he heard them go,"
1592,THE RETURN.,Then swiftly turned the knob and went inside.
1593,THE RETURN.,The blind-pull at the window volleyed wide;
1594,THE RETURN.,The curtains streamed out like a waterfall;
1595,THE RETURN.,The pictures of the fox-hunt clacked along the wall.
1596,THE RETURN.,
1597,THE RETURN.,No one was there; no one; the room was hers.
1598,THE RETURN.,A book of praise lay open on the bed;
1599,THE RETURN.,"The clothes-press smelt of many lavenders,"
1600,THE RETURN.,Her spirit stamped the room; herself was fled.
1601,THE RETURN.,"Here she found peace of soul like daily bread,"
1602,THE RETURN.,"Here, with her lover Lion; Michael gazed;"
1603,THE RETURN.,He would have been the sharer had he not been crazed.
1604,THE RETURN.,
1605,THE RETURN.,He took the love-gift handkerchief again;
1606,THE RETURN.,"He laid it on her table, near the glass,"
1607,THE RETURN.,So opened that the broidered name was plain;
1608,THE RETURN.,"“Plain,” he exclaimed, “she cannot let it pass."
1609,THE RETURN.,It stands and speaks for me as bold as brass.
1610,THE RETURN.,"My answer, my heart’s cry, to tell her this,"
1611,THE RETURN.,That she is still my darling; all she was she is.
1612,THE RETURN.,
1613,THE RETURN.,"“So she will know at least that she was wrong,"
1614,THE RETURN.,That underneath the blindness I was true.
1615,THE RETURN.,"Fate is the strongest thing, though men are strong;"
1616,THE RETURN.,Out from beyond life I was sealed to you.
1617,THE RETURN.,But my blind ways destroyed the cords that drew;
1618,THE RETURN.,"And now, the evil done, I know my need;"
1619,THE RETURN.,Fate has his way with those who mar what is decreed.
1620,THE RETURN.,
1621,THE RETURN.,"“And now, good-bye.” He closed the door behind him,"
1622,THE RETURN.,"Then stept, with firm swift footstep down the stair,"
1623,THE RETURN.,Meaning to go where she would never find him;
1624,THE RETURN.,He would go down through darkness to despair.
1625,THE RETURN.,Out at the door he stept; the autumn air
1626,THE RETURN.,Came fresh upon his face; none saw him go.
1627,THE RETURN.,"“Good-bye, my love,” he muttered; “it is better so.”"
1628,THE RETURN.,
1629,THE RETURN.,"Soon he was on the high road, out of sight"
1630,THE RETURN.,Of valley and farm; soon he could see no more
1631,THE RETURN.,The oast-house pointing finger take the light
1632,THE RETURN.,As tumbling pigeons glittered over; nor
1633,THE RETURN.,"Could he behold the wind-vane gilded o’er,"
1634,THE RETURN.,Swinging above the church; the road swung round.
1635,THE RETURN.,"“Now, the last look,” he cried: he saw that holy ground."
1636,THE RETURN.,
1637,THE RETURN.,"“Good-bye,” he cried; he could behold it all,"
1638,THE RETURN.,Spread out as in a picture; but so clear
1639,THE RETURN.,That the gold apple stood out from the wall;
1640,THE RETURN.,Like a red jewel stood the grazing steer.
1641,THE RETURN.,"Precise, intensely coloured, all brought near,"
1642,THE RETURN.,"As in a vision, lay that holy ground."
1643,THE RETURN.,"“Mary is there,” he moaned, “and I am outward bound."
1644,THE RETURN.,
1645,THE RETURN.,"“I never saw this place so beautiful,"
1646,THE RETURN.,Never like this. I never saw it glow.
1647,THE RETURN.,Spirit is on this place; it fills it full.
1648,THE RETURN.,So let the die be cast; I will not go.
1649,THE RETURN.,But I will see her face to face and know
1650,THE RETURN.,From her own lips what thoughts she has of me;
1651,THE RETURN.,And if disaster come: right; let disaster be.”
1652,THE RETURN.,
1653,THE RETURN.,"Back, by another way, he turned. The sun"
1654,THE RETURN.,Fired the yew-tops in the Roman woods.
1655,THE RETURN.,"Lights in the valley twinkled one by one,"
1656,THE RETURN.,The starlings whirled in dropping multitudes.
1657,THE RETURN.,"Dusk fingered into one earth’s many moods,"
1658,THE RETURN.,Back to The Roughs he walked; he neared the brook;
1659,THE RETURN.,A lamp burned in the farm; he saw; his fingers shook.
1660,THE RETURN.,
1661,THE RETURN.,"He had to cross the brook, to cross a field"
1662,THE RETURN.,Where daffodils were thick when years were young.
1663,THE RETURN.,"Then, were she there, his fortunes should be sealed."
1664,THE RETURN.,Down the mud trackway to the brook he swung;
1665,THE RETURN.,"Then while the passion trembled on his tongue,"
1666,THE RETURN.,"Dim, by the dim bridge-stile, he seemed to see"
1667,THE RETURN.,A figure standing mute; a woman--it was she.
1668,THE RETURN.,
1669,THE RETURN.,"She stood quite stilly, waiting for him there."
1670,THE RETURN.,She did not seem surprised; the meeting seemed
1671,THE RETURN.,Planned from all time by powers in the air
1672,THE RETURN.,To change their human fates; he even deemed
1673,THE RETURN.,"That in another life this thing had gleamed,"
1674,THE RETURN.,"This meeting by the bridge. He said, “It’s you.”"
1675,THE RETURN.,"“Yes, I,” she said, “who else? You must have known; you knew"
1676,THE RETURN.,
1677,THE RETURN.,"“That I should come here to the brook to see,"
1678,THE RETURN.,"After your message.” “You were out,” he said."
1679,THE RETURN.,"“Gone, and I did not know where you could be."
1680,THE RETURN.,"Where were you, Mary, when the thing was laid?”"
1681,THE RETURN.,"“Old Mrs. Cale is dying, and I stayed"
1682,THE RETURN.,"Longer than usual, while I read the Word."
1683,THE RETURN.,"You could have hardly gone.” She paused, her bosom stirred."
1684,THE RETURN.,
1685,THE RETURN.,"“Mary, I sinned,” he said. “Not that, dear, no,”"
1686,THE RETURN.,"She said; “but, oh, you were unkind, unkind,"
1687,THE RETURN.,"Never to write a word and leave me so,"
1688,THE RETURN.,But out of sight with you is out of mind.”
1689,THE RETURN.,"“Mary, I sinned,” he said, “and I was blind."
1690,THE RETURN.,"Oh, my beloved, are you Lion’s wife?”"
1691,THE RETURN.,"“Belov’d sounds strange,” she answered, “in my present life."
1692,THE RETURN.,
1693,THE RETURN.,"“But it is sweet to hear it, all the same."
1694,THE RETURN.,It is a language little heard by me
1695,THE RETURN.,"Alone, in that man’s keeping, with my shame."
1696,THE RETURN.,I never thought such miseries could be.
1697,THE RETURN.,"I was so happy in you, Michael. He"
1698,THE RETURN.,Came when I felt you changed from what I thought you.
1699,THE RETURN.,"Even now it is not love, but jealousy that brought you.”"
1700,THE RETURN.,
1701,THE RETURN.,"“That is untrue,” he said. “I am in hell."
1702,THE RETURN.,"You are my heart’s beloved, Mary, you."
1703,THE RETURN.,"By God, I know your beauty now too well."
1704,THE RETURN.,"We are each other’s, flesh and soul, we two.”"
1705,THE RETURN.,"“That was sweet knowledge once,” she said; “we knew"
1706,THE RETURN.,"That truth of old. Now, in a strange man’s bed,"
1707,THE RETURN.,"I read it in my soul, and find it written red.”"
1708,THE RETURN.,
1709,THE RETURN.,"“Is he a brute?” he asked. “No,” she replied."
1710,THE RETURN.,“I did not understand what it would mean.
1711,THE RETURN.,"And now that you are back, would I had died;"
1712,THE RETURN.,"Died, and the misery of it not have been."
1713,THE RETURN.,"Lion would not be wrecked, nor I unclean."
1714,THE RETURN.,"I was a proud one once, and now I’m tame;"
1715,THE RETURN.,"Oh, Michael, say some word to take away my shame.”"
1716,THE RETURN.,
1717,THE RETURN.,She sobbed; his arms went round her; the night heard
1718,THE RETURN.,"Intense fierce whispering passing, soul to soul,"
1719,THE RETURN.,"Love running hot on many a murmured word,"
1720,THE RETURN.,Love’s passionate giving into new control.
1721,THE RETURN.,"Their present misery did but blow the coal,"
1722,THE RETURN.,"Did but entangle deeper their two wills,"
1723,THE RETURN.,While the brown brook ran on by buried daffodils.
1724,THE RETURN.,
1725,THE RETURN.,
1726,THE RETURN.,
1727,THE RETURN.,
1728,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.
1729,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1730,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1731,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Lion lay still while the cold tides of death
1732,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Came brimming up his channels. With one hand
1733,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,He groped to know if Michael still drew breath.
1734,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,His little hour was running out its sand.
1735,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Then, in a mist, he saw his Mary stand"
1736,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Above. He cried aloud, “He was my brother."
1737,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"I was his comrade sworn, and we have killed each other."
1738,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1739,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Oh desolate grief, beloved, and through me."
1740,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"We wise who try to change. Oh, you wild birds,"
1741,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Help my unhappy spirit to the sea.
1742,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,The golden bowl is scattered into sherds.”
1743,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,And Mary knelt and murmured passionate words
1744,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,To that poor body on the dabbled flowers:
1745,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Oh, beauty, oh, sweet soul, oh, little love of ours--"
1746,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1747,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Michael, my own heart’s darling, speak; it’s me,"
1748,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Mary. You know my voice. I’m here, dear, here."
1749,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Oh, little golden-haired one, listen. See,"
1750,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"It’s Mary, Michael. Speak to Mary, dear."
1751,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Oh, Michael, little love, he cannot hear;"
1752,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"And you have killed him, Lion; he is dead."
1753,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"My little friend, my love, my Michael, golden head."
1754,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1755,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“We had such fun together, such sweet fun,"
1756,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"My love and I, my merry love and I."
1757,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Oh, love, you shone upon me like the sun."
1758,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Oh, Michael, say some little last good-bye.”"
1759,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Then in a calm voice Lion called, “I die."
1760,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Go home and tell my people. Mary. Hear.
1761,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Though I have wrought this ruin, I have loved you, dear."
1762,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1763,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Better than he; not better, dear, as well."
1764,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"If you could kiss me, dearest, at this last."
1765,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"We have made bloody doorways from our hell,"
1766,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Cutting our tangle. Now, the murder past,"
1767,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,We are but pitiful poor souls; and fast
1768,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"The darkness and the cold come. Kiss me, sweet;"
1769,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,I loved you all my life; but some lives never meet
1770,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1771,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,“Though they go wandering side by side through Time.
1772,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Kiss me,” he cried. She bent, she kissed his brow."
1773,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Oh, friend,” she said, “you’re lying in the slime.”"
1774,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Three blind ones, dear,” he murmured, “in the slough,"
1775,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Caught fast for death; but never mind that now;
1776,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Go home and tell my people. I am dying,"
1777,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Dying dear, dying now.” He died; she left him lying,"
1778,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1779,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,And kissed her dead one’s head and crossed the field.
1780,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“They have been killed,” she called, in a great crying."
1781,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Killed, and our spirits’ eyes are all unsealed"
1782,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,The blood is scattered on the flowers drying.”
1783,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"It was the hush of dusk, and owls were flying;"
1784,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,They hooted as the Occleves ran to bring
1785,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,That sorry harvest home from Death’s red harvesting.
1786,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1787,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,They laid the bodies on the bed together.
1788,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"And “You were beautiful,” she said, “and you"
1789,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Were my own darling in the April weather.
1790,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"You knew my very soul, you knew, you knew."
1791,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Oh, my sweet, piteous love, I was not true."
1792,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Fetch me fair water and the flowers of spring;
1793,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"My love is dead, and I must deck his burying.”"
1794,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1795,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,They left her with her dead; they could not choose
1796,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,But grant the spirit burning in her face
1797,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Rights that their pity urged them to refuse.
1798,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,They did her sorrow and the dead a grace.
1799,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,All night they heard her passing footsteps trace
1800,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,About the flooring in the room of death.
1801,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"They heard her singing there, lowly, with gentle breath,"
1802,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1803,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Yet when the darkness passed they tried the door,"
1804,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"And burst it, fearing; there the singer lay"
1805,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Drooped at her lover’s bedside on the floor,"
1806,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Singing her passionate last of life away.
1807,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,White flowers had fallen from a blackthorn spray
1808,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Over her loosened hair. Pale flowers of spring
1809,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Filled the white room of death; they everything.
1810,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1811,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Primroses, daffodils, and cuckoo-flowers."
1812,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,She bowed her singing head on Michael’s breast.
1813,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"“Oh, it was sweet,” she cried, “that love of ours."
1814,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"You were the dearest, sweet; I loved you best."
1815,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Beloved, my beloved, let me rest"
1816,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"By you forever, little Michael mine."
1817,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Now the great hour is stricken, and the bread and wine"
1818,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1819,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,“Broken and spilt; and now the homing birds
1820,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Draw to a covert, Michael; I to you."
1821,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Bury us two together,” came her words."
1822,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,The dropping petals fell about the two.
1823,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Her heart had broken; she was dead. They drew
1824,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Her gentle head aside; they found it pressed
1825,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Against the broidered ’kerchief spread on Michael’s breast,"
1826,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1827,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"The one that bore her name in Michael’s hair,"
1828,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Given so long before. They let her lie
1829,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"While the dim moon died out upon the air,"
1830,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,And happy sunlight coloured all the sky.
1831,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,The lack cock crowed for morning; carts went by;
1832,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Smoke rose from cottage chimneys; from the byre
1833,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"The yokes went clanking by, to dairy, through the mire."
1834,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1835,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"In the day’s noise the water’s noise was stilled,"
1836,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"But still it slipped along, the cold hill-spring,"
1837,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Dropping from leafy hollows, which it filled,"
1838,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,On to the pebbly shelves which made it sing;
1839,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Glints glittered on it from the ’fisher’s wing;
1840,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,It saw the moorhen nesting; then it stayed
1841,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,In a great space of reeds where merry otters played.
1842,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1843,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Slowly it loitered past the shivering reeds
1844,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Into a mightier water; thence its course
1845,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Becomes a pasture where the salmon feeds,"
1846,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,Wherein no bubble tells its humble source;
1847,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"But the great waves go rolling, and the horse"
1848,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Snorts at the bursting waves and will not drink,"
1849,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"And the great ships go outward, bubbling to the brink,"
1850,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,
1851,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Outward, with men upon them, stretched in line,"
1852,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Handling the halliards to the ocean’s gates,"
1853,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Where flicking windflaws fill the air with brine,"
1854,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,And all the ocean opens. Then the mates
1855,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,"Cry, and the sunburnt crew no longer waits,"
1856,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,But sings triumphant and the topsail fills
1857,THE END OF THE TROUBLE.,To this old tale of woe among the daffodils.

2030,MESSENGER.,Still as in port when peace has been restored.
2031,MESSENGER.,
2032,MESSENGER.,"The wind and sea were fair,"
2033,MESSENGER.,We lay at anchor there;
2034,MESSENGER.,"The stars burned in the air,"
2035,MESSENGER.,"The men were sleeping,"
2036,MESSENGER.,When in the midnight dark
2037,MESSENGER.,Our watchman saw a spark
2038,MESSENGER.,Suddenly light a bark
2039,MESSENGER.,With long flames leaping.
2040,MESSENGER.,
2041,MESSENGER.,"Then, as they stood amazed,"
2042,MESSENGER.,Others and other blazed;
2043,MESSENGER.,"Then terror set them crazed,"
2044,MESSENGER.,They ran down screaming:
2045,MESSENGER.,“Fire-ships are coming! Wake!
2046,MESSENGER.,"Cast loose, for Jesus’ sake!"
2047,MESSENGER.,Eight fire-ships come from Drake--
2048,MESSENGER.,Look at their gleaming!”
2049,MESSENGER.,
2050,MESSENGER.,"Roused in the dark from bed,"
2051,MESSENGER.,"We saw the fire show red,"
2052,MESSENGER.,And instant panic spread
2053,MESSENGER.,Through troops and sailors;
2054,MESSENGER.,"They swarmed on deck unclad,"
2055,MESSENGER.,"They did what terror bade,"
2056,MESSENGER.,"King, they were like the mad"
2057,MESSENGER.,Escaped from jailers.
2058,MESSENGER.,
2059,MESSENGER.,"Some prayed for mercy, some"
2060,MESSENGER.,"Rang bells or beat the drum,"
2061,MESSENGER.,As though despair had come
2062,MESSENGER.,At hell’s contriving;
2063,MESSENGER.,Captains with terror pale
2064,MESSENGER.,"Screamed through the dark their hail,"
2065,MESSENGER.,"“Cut cable, loose the sail,"
2066,MESSENGER.,And set all driving!”
2067,MESSENGER.,
2068,MESSENGER.,"Heading all ways at once,"
2069,MESSENGER.,"Grinding each other’s guns,"
2070,MESSENGER.,Our blundering galleons
2071,MESSENGER.,"Athwart-hawse galleys,"
2072,MESSENGER.,"Timbers and plankings cleft,"
2073,MESSENGER.,"And half our tackling reft,"
2074,MESSENGER.,Your grand Armada left
2075,MESSENGER.,The roads of Calais.
2076,MESSENGER.,
2077,MESSENGER.,Weary and overwrought
2078,MESSENGER.,We strove to make all taut;
2079,MESSENGER.,But when the morning brought
2080,MESSENGER.,"The dawn to light us,"
2081,MESSENGER.,"Drake, with the weather gage,"
2082,MESSENGER.,"Made signal to engage,"
2083,MESSENGER.,"And, like a pard in rage,"
2084,MESSENGER.,Bore down to fight us.
2085,MESSENGER.,
2086,MESSENGER.,Nobly the English line
2087,MESSENGER.,"Trampled the bubbled brine,"
2088,MESSENGER.,We heard the gun-trucks whine
2089,MESSENGER.,To the taut laniard.
2090,MESSENGER.,"Onwards we saw them forge,"
2091,MESSENGER.,White-billowing at the gorge.
2092,MESSENGER.,"“On, on!” they cried, “St. George!"
2093,MESSENGER.,Down with the Spaniard!”
2094,MESSENGER.,
2095,MESSENGER.,From their van squadron broke
2096,MESSENGER.,"A withering battle-stroke,"
2097,MESSENGER.,Tearing our plankèd oak
2098,MESSENGER.,"By straiks asunder,"
2099,MESSENGER.,Blasting the wood like rot
2100,MESSENGER.,"With such a hail of shot,"
2101,MESSENGER.,So constant and so hot
2102,MESSENGER.,It beat us under.
2103,MESSENGER.,
2104,MESSENGER.,The English would not close;
2105,MESSENGER.,"They fought us as they chose,"
2106,MESSENGER.,Dealing us deadly blows
2107,MESSENGER.,For seven hours.
2108,MESSENGER.,Lords of our chiefest rank
2109,MESSENGER.,"The bitter billow drank,"
2110,MESSENGER.,For there the English sank
2111,MESSENGER.,Three ships of ours.
2112,MESSENGER.,
2113,MESSENGER.,*       *       *       *       *
2114,MESSENGER.,
2115,MESSENGER.,Then the wind forced us northward from the fight;
2116,MESSENGER.,We could not ship the army nor return;
2117,MESSENGER.,"We held the sea in trouble through the night,"
2118,MESSENGER.,Watching the English signals blink and burn.
2119,MESSENGER.,The English in a dim cloud kept astern;
2120,MESSENGER.,"All night they signalled, while our shattered ships"
2121,MESSENGER.,Huddled like beasts beneath the drovers’ whips.
2122,MESSENGER.,
2123,MESSENGER.,*       *       *       *       *
2124,MESSENGER.,
2125,MESSENGER.,At dawn the same wind held; we could not strive.
2126,MESSENGER.,The English drove us north as herdsmen drive.
2127,MESSENGER.,
2128,MESSENGER.,*       *       *       *       *
2129,MESSENGER.,
2130,MESSENGER.,"Under our tattered flags,"
2131,MESSENGER.,"With rigging cut to rags,"
2132,MESSENGER.,Our ships like stricken stags
2133,MESSENGER.,Were heaped and hounded.
2134,MESSENGER.,"Caught by the unknown tide,"
2135,MESSENGER.,"With neither chart nor guide,"
2136,MESSENGER.,"We fouled the Holland side,"
2137,MESSENGER.,Where four more grounded.
2138,MESSENGER.,
2139,MESSENGER.,"Our water-casks were burst,"
2140,MESSENGER.,"The horses died of thirst,"
2141,MESSENGER.,"The wounded raved and curst,"
2142,MESSENGER.,"Uncared, untended."
2143,MESSENGER.,All night we heard the crying
2144,MESSENGER.,Of lonely shipmates dying;
2145,MESSENGER.,We had to leave them lying.
2146,MESSENGER.,So the fight ended.
2147,MESSENGER.,
2148,PHILIP.,PHILIP.
2149,PHILIP.,
2150,PHILIP.,God gives His victory as He wills. But this
2151,PHILIP.,Was not complete destruction. What thing worse
2152,PHILIP.,Came to destroy you?
2153,PHILIP.,
2154,MESSENGER.,MESSENGER.
2155,MESSENGER.,
2156,MESSENGER.,"An avenging curse,"
2157,MESSENGER.,"Due for old sins, destroyed us."
2158,MESSENGER.,
2159,PHILIP.,PHILIP.
2160,PHILIP.,
2161,PHILIP.,Tell the tale.
2162,PHILIP.,
2163,MESSENGER.,MESSENGER.
2164,MESSENGER.,
2165,MESSENGER.,"O King, when morning dawned it blew a gale,"
2166,MESSENGER.,"But still the English followed, and we fled"
2167,MESSENGER.,Till breakers made the dirty waters pale.
2168,MESSENGER.,"We saw the Zeeland sandbanks right ahead,"
2169,MESSENGER.,Blind in a whirling spray that gave us dread;
2170,MESSENGER.,"For we were blown there, and the water shoaled."
2171,MESSENGER.,"The crying of the leadsmen at the lead,"
2172,MESSENGER.,"Calling the soundings, were our death-bells tolled."
2173,MESSENGER.,We drifted down to death upon the sands;
2174,MESSENGER.,The English drew away to watch us drown;
2175,MESSENGER.,We saw the bitter breakers with grey hands
2176,MESSENGER.,Tear the dead body of the sandbank brown.
2177,MESSENGER.,"We could do nothing, so we drifted down"
2178,MESSENGER.,Singing the psalms for death; we who had been
2179,MESSENGER.,"Lords of the sea and knights of great renown,"
2180,MESSENGER.,Doomed to be strangled by a death unclean.
2181,MESSENGER.,
2182,PHILIP.,PHILIP.
2183,PHILIP.,
2184,PHILIP.,So there the ships were wrecked?
2185,PHILIP.,
2186,MESSENGER.,MESSENGER.
2187,MESSENGER.,
2188,MESSENGER.,Time had not struck.
2189,MESSENGER.,"O King, we learned how blessed mercy saves:"
2190,MESSENGER.,"Even as our forefoot grounded on the muck,"
2191,MESSENGER.,"Tripping us up to drown us in the waves,"
2192,MESSENGER.,A sudden windshift snatched us from our graves
2193,MESSENGER.,"And drove us north; and now another woe,"
2194,MESSENGER.,"Tempest unending, beat our ships to staves--"
2195,MESSENGER.,A never-dying gale with frost and snow.
2196,MESSENGER.,
2197,MESSENGER.,"Now our hearts failed, for food and water failed;"
2198,MESSENGER.,"The men fell sick by troops, the wounded died."
2199,MESSENGER.,They washed about the wet decks as we sailed
2200,MESSENGER.,For want of strength to lift them overside.
2201,MESSENGER.,"Desolate seas we sailed, so grim, so wide,"
2202,MESSENGER.,That ship by ship our comrades disappeared.
2203,MESSENGER.,"With neither sun nor star to be a guide,"
2204,MESSENGER.,Like spirits of the wretched dead we steered.
2205,MESSENGER.,
2206,MESSENGER.,"Till, having beaten through the Pentland Pass,"
2207,MESSENGER.,"We saw the Irish surf, with mists of spray"
2208,MESSENGER.,"Blowing far inland, blasting trees and grass,"
2209,MESSENGER.,"And gave God thanks, for we espied a bay"
2210,MESSENGER.,"Safe, with bright water running down the clay--"
2211,MESSENGER.,A running brook where we could drink and drink.
2212,MESSENGER.,"But drawing near, our ships were cast away,"
2213,MESSENGER.,Bilged on the rocks; we saw our comrades sink....
2214,MESSENGER.,
2215,MESSENGER.,Or worse: for those the breakers cast ashore
2216,MESSENGER.,The Irish killed and stripped; their bodies white
2217,MESSENGER.,"Lay naked to the wolves--yea, sixty score--"
2218,MESSENGER.,"All down the windy beach, a piteous sight."
2219,MESSENGER.,The savage Irish watched by bonfire light
2220,MESSENGER.,Lest more should come ashore; we heard them there
2221,MESSENGER.,Screaming the bloody news of their delight.
2222,MESSENGER.,Then we abandoned hope and new despair.
2223,MESSENGER.,
2224,MESSENGER.,"And now the fleet is sunken in the sea,"
2225,MESSENGER.,"And all the seamen, all the might of Spain,"
2226,MESSENGER.,"Are dead, O King, and out of misery,"
2227,MESSENGER.,Never to drag at frozen ropes again.
2228,MESSENGER.,"Never to know defeat, nor feel the pain"
2229,MESSENGER.,Of watching dear companions sink and die.
2230,MESSENGER.,Death’s everlasting armistice to the brain
2231,MESSENGER.,Gives their poor griefs quietus; let them lie.
2232,MESSENGER.,
2233,MESSENGER.,"I, like a ghost returning from the grave,"
2234,MESSENGER.,Come from a stricken ship to tell the news
2235,MESSENGER.,"Of Spanish honour which we could not save,"
2236,MESSENGER.,"Nor win again, nor even die to lose;"
2237,MESSENGER.,And since God’s hidden wisdom loves to bruise
2238,MESSENGER.,"Those whom He loves, we, trembling in despair,"
2239,MESSENGER.,"Will watch our griefs to see God’s finger there,"
2240,MESSENGER.,And make His will our solace and excuse.
2241,MESSENGER.,
2242,MESSENGER.,Defeat is bitter and the truth is hard--
2243,MESSENGER.,"Spain is defeated, England has prevailed;"
2244,MESSENGER.,"This is the banner which I could not guard,"
2245,MESSENGER.,And this the consecrated sword which failed.
2246,MESSENGER.,Do with your dying Captain as you will.
2247,MESSENGER.,
2248,MESSENGER.,(_He lays down sword and banner._)
2249,MESSENGER.,
2250,PHILIP.,PHILIP.
2251,PHILIP.,
2252,PHILIP.,"I, from my heart, thank God, from whose great hand"
2253,PHILIP.,"I am so helped with power, I can still"
2254,PHILIP.,Set out another fleet against that land.
2255,PHILIP.,Nor do I think it ill
2256,PHILIP.,If all the running water takes its course
2257,PHILIP.,While there are unspent fountains at the source.
2258,PHILIP.,
2259,PHILIP.,He sendeth out His word and melteth them.
2260,PHILIP.,"Take back your standard, Captain. As you go,"
2261,PHILIP.,Bid the bells toll and let the clergy come.
2262,PHILIP.,Then in the city by the strike of drum
2263,PHILIP.,Proclaim a general fast. In bitter days
2264,PHILIP.,"The soul finds God, God us."
2265,PHILIP.,
2266,PHILIP.,(_Exit_ CAPTAIN.)
2267,PHILIP.,
2268,PHILIP.,PHILIP (_Alone_).
2269,PHILIP.,
2270,PHILIP.,"De Leyva, friend,"
2271,PHILIP.,"Whom I shall never see, never again,"
2272,PHILIP.,This misery that I feel is over Spain.
2273,PHILIP.,"O God, beloved God, in pity send"
2274,PHILIP.,"That blessed rose among the thorns, an end:"
2275,PHILIP.,Give a bruised spirit peace.
2276,PHILIP.,
2277,PHILIP.,(_He kneels. A muffled march of the drums._)

2288,TRUTH,Has but an hour of breath
2289,TRUTH,To build a ship of truth
2290,TRUTH,In which his soul may sail.
2291,TRUTH,"Sail on the sea of death,"
2292,TRUTH,For death takes toll
2293,TRUTH,"Of beauty, courage, youth,"
2294,TRUTH,Of all but truth.
2295,TRUTH,
2296,TRUTH,"Life’s city ways are dark,"
2297,TRUTH,Men mutter by; the wells
2298,TRUTH,Of the great waters moan.
2299,TRUTH,O death! O sea! O tide!
2300,TRUTH,The waters moan like bells;
2301,TRUTH,"No light, no mark,"
2302,TRUTH,The soul goes out alone
2303,TRUTH,On seas unknown.
2304,TRUTH,
2305,TRUTH,"Stripped of all purple robes,"
2306,TRUTH,"Stripped of all golden lies,"

2317,THE “WANDERER”,THE “WANDERER”
2318,THE “WANDERER”,
2319,THE “WANDERER”,
2320,THE “WANDERER”,"All day they loitered by the resting ships,"
2321,THE “WANDERER”,"Telling their beauties over, taking stock;"
2322,THE “WANDERER”,"At night the verdict left my messmates’ lips,"
2323,THE “WANDERER”,“The _Wanderer_ is the finest ship in dock.”
2324,THE “WANDERER”,
2325,THE “WANDERER”,"I had not seen her, but a friend, since drowned,"
2326,THE “WANDERER”,"Drew her, with painted ports, low, lovely, lean,"
2327,THE “WANDERER”,"Saying, “The _Wanderer_, clipper, outward bound,"
2328,THE “WANDERER”,The loveliest ship my eyes have ever seen--
2329,THE “WANDERER”,
2330,THE “WANDERER”,“Perhaps to-morrow you will see her sail.
2331,THE “WANDERER”,She sails at sunrise”: but the morrow showed
2332,THE “WANDERER”,No _Wanderer_ setting forth for me to hail;
2333,THE “WANDERER”,"Far down the stream men pointed where she rode,"
2334,THE “WANDERER”,
2335,THE “WANDERER”,"Rode the great trackway to the sea, dim, dim,"
2336,THE “WANDERER”,Already gone before the stars were gone.
2337,THE “WANDERER”,I saw her at the sea-line’s smoky rim
2338,THE “WANDERER”,Grow swiftly vaguer as they towed her on.
2339,THE “WANDERER”,
2340,THE “WANDERER”,Soon even her masts were hidden in the haze
2341,THE “WANDERER”,Beyond the city; she was on her course
2342,THE “WANDERER”,To trample billows for a hundred days;
2343,THE “WANDERER”,"That afternoon the norther gathered force,"
2344,THE “WANDERER”,
2345,THE “WANDERER”,Blowing a small snow from a point of east.
2346,THE “WANDERER”,"“Oh, fair for her,” we said, “to take her south.”"
2347,THE “WANDERER”,"And in our spirits, as the wind increased,"
2348,THE “WANDERER”,"We saw her there, beyond the river mouth,"
2349,THE “WANDERER”,
2350,THE “WANDERER”,"Setting her side-lights in the wildering dark,"
2351,THE “WANDERER”,"To glint upon mad water, while the gale"
2352,THE “WANDERER”,"Roared like a battle, snapping like a shark,"
2353,THE “WANDERER”,And drunken seamen struggled with the sail.
2354,THE “WANDERER”,
2355,THE “WANDERER”,While with sick hearts her mates put out of mind
2356,THE “WANDERER”,"Their little children left astern, ashore,"
2357,THE “WANDERER”,"And the gale’s gathering made the darkness blind,"
2358,THE “WANDERER”,Water and air one intermingled roar.
2359,THE “WANDERER”,
2360,THE “WANDERER”,"Then we forgot her, for the fiddlers played,"
2361,THE “WANDERER”,Dancing and singing held our merry crew;
2362,THE “WANDERER”,The old ship moaned a little as she swayed.
2363,THE “WANDERER”,"It blew all night, oh, bitter hard it blew!"
2364,THE “WANDERER”,
2365,THE “WANDERER”,So that at midnight I was called on deck
2366,THE “WANDERER”,To keep an anchor-watch: I heard the sea
2367,THE “WANDERER”,Roar past in white procession filled with wreck;
2368,THE “WANDERER”,"Intense bright frosty stars burned over me,"
2369,THE “WANDERER”,
2370,THE “WANDERER”,"And the Greek brig beside us dipped and dipped,"
2371,THE “WANDERER”,"White to the muzzle like a half-tide rock,"
2372,THE “WANDERER”,Drowned to the mainmast with the seas she shipped;
2373,THE “WANDERER”,Her cable-swivels clanged at every shock.
2374,THE “WANDERER”,
2375,THE “WANDERER”,"And like a never-dying force, the wind"
2376,THE “WANDERER”,"Roared till we shouted with it, roared until"
2377,THE “WANDERER”,"Its vast vitality of wrath was thinned,"
2378,THE “WANDERER”,Had beat its fury breathless and was still.
2379,THE “WANDERER”,
2380,THE “WANDERER”,"By dawn the gale had dwindled into flaw,"
2381,THE “WANDERER”,A glorious morning followed: with my friend
2382,THE “WANDERER”,I climbed the fo’c’s’le-head to see; we saw
2383,THE “WANDERER”,The waters hurrying shorewards without end.
2384,THE “WANDERER”,
2385,THE “WANDERER”,Haze blotted out the river’s lowest reach;
2386,THE “WANDERER”,"Out of the gloom the steamers, passing by,"
2387,THE “WANDERER”,"Called with their sirens, hooting their sea-speech;"
2388,THE “WANDERER”,Out of the dimness others made reply.
2389,THE “WANDERER”,
2390,THE “WANDERER”,"And as we watched, there came a rush of feet"
2391,THE “WANDERER”,Charging the fo’c’s’le till the hatchway shook.
2392,THE “WANDERER”,"Men all about us thrust their way, or beat,"
2393,THE “WANDERER”,"Crying, “The _Wanderer_! Down the river! Look!”"
2394,THE “WANDERER”,
2395,THE “WANDERER”,I looked with them towards the dimness; there
2396,THE “WANDERER”,"Gleamed like a spirit striding out of night,"
2397,THE “WANDERER”,"A full-rigged ship unutterably fair,"
2398,THE “WANDERER”,"Her masts like trees in winter, frosty-bright."
2399,THE “WANDERER”,
2400,THE “WANDERER”,Foam trembled at her bows like wisps of wool;
2401,THE “WANDERER”,She trembled as she towed. I had not dreamed
2402,THE “WANDERER”,"That work of man could be so beautiful,"
2403,THE “WANDERER”,In its own presence and in what it seemed.
2404,THE “WANDERER”,
2405,THE “WANDERER”,"“So, she is putting back again,” I said."
2406,THE “WANDERER”,“How white with frost her yards are on the fore.”
2407,THE “WANDERER”,"One of the men about me answer made,"
2408,THE “WANDERER”,"“That is not frost, but all her sails are tore,"
2409,THE “WANDERER”,
2410,THE “WANDERER”,"“Torn into tatters, youngster, in the gale;"
2411,THE “WANDERER”,"Her best foul-weather suit gone.” It was true,"
2412,THE “WANDERER”,Her masts were white with rags of tattered sail
2413,THE “WANDERER”,Many as gannets when the fish are due.
2414,THE “WANDERER”,
2415,THE “WANDERER”,"Beauty in desolation was her pride,"
2416,THE “WANDERER”,Her crowned array a glory that had been;
2417,THE “WANDERER”,"She faltered tow’rds us like a swan that died,"
2418,THE “WANDERER”,But although ruined she was still a queen.
2419,THE “WANDERER”,
2420,THE “WANDERER”,"“Put back with all her sails gone,” went the word;"
2421,THE “WANDERER”,"Then, from her signals flying, rumour ran,"
2422,THE “WANDERER”,“The sea that stove her boats in killed her third;
2423,THE “WANDERER”,She has been gutted and has lost a man.”
2424,THE “WANDERER”,
2425,THE “WANDERER”,"So, as though stepping to a funeral march,"
2426,THE “WANDERER”,"She passed defeated homewards whence she came,"
2427,THE “WANDERER”,"Ragged with tattered canvas white as starch,"
2428,THE “WANDERER”,A wild bird that misfortune had made tame.
2429,THE “WANDERER”,
2430,THE “WANDERER”,She was refitted soon: another took
2431,THE “WANDERER”,The dead man’s office; then the singers hove
2432,THE “WANDERER”,Her capstan till the snapping hawsers shook;
2433,THE “WANDERER”,"Out, with a bubble at her bows, she drove."
2434,THE “WANDERER”,
2435,THE “WANDERER”,"Again they towed her seawards, and again"
2436,THE “WANDERER”,"We, watching, praised her beauty, praised her trim,"
2437,THE “WANDERER”,"Saw her fair house-flag flutter at the main,"
2438,THE “WANDERER”,"And slowly saunter seawards, dwindling dim;"
2439,THE “WANDERER”,
2440,THE “WANDERER”,"And wished her well, and wondered, as she died,"
2441,THE “WANDERER”,"How, when her canvas had been sheeted home,"
2442,THE “WANDERER”,"Her quivering length would sweep into her stride,"
2443,THE “WANDERER”,Making the greenness milky with her foam.
2444,THE “WANDERER”,
2445,THE “WANDERER”,"But when we rose next morning, we discerned"
2446,THE “WANDERER”,Her beauty once again a shattered thing;
2447,THE “WANDERER”,"Towing to dock the _Wanderer_ returned,"
2448,THE “WANDERER”,A wounded sea-bird with a broken wing.
2449,THE “WANDERER”,
2450,THE “WANDERER”,"A spar was gone, her rigging’s disarray"
2451,THE “WANDERER”,Told of a worst disaster than the last;
2452,THE “WANDERER”,"Like draggled hair dishevelled hung the stay,"
2453,THE “WANDERER”,Drooping and beating on the broken mast.
2454,THE “WANDERER”,
2455,THE “WANDERER”,Half-mast upon her flagstaff hung her flag;
2456,THE “WANDERER”,Word went among us how the broken spar
2457,THE “WANDERER”,"Had gored her captain like an angry stag,"
2458,THE “WANDERER”,And killed her mate a half-day from the bar.
2459,THE “WANDERER”,
2460,THE “WANDERER”,She passed to dock upon the top of flood.
2461,THE “WANDERER”,An old man near me shook his head and swore:
2462,THE “WANDERER”,"“Like a bad woman, she has tasted blood--"
2463,THE “WANDERER”,There’ll be no trusting in her any more.”
2464,THE “WANDERER”,
2465,THE “WANDERER”,"We thought it truth, and when we saw her there"
2466,THE “WANDERER”,"Lying in dock, beyond, across the stream,"
2467,THE “WANDERER”,"We would forget that we had called her fair,"
2468,THE “WANDERER”,We thought her murderess and the past a dream.
2469,THE “WANDERER”,
2470,THE “WANDERER”,"And when she sailed again, we watched in awe,"
2471,THE “WANDERER”,"Wondering what bloody act her beauty planned,"
2472,THE “WANDERER”,"What evil lurked behind the thing we saw,"
2473,THE “WANDERER”,"What strength was there that thus annulled man’s hand,"
2474,THE “WANDERER”,
2475,THE “WANDERER”,How next its triumph would compel man’s will
2476,THE “WANDERER”,"Into compliance with external Fate,"
2477,THE “WANDERER”,How next the powers would use her to work ill
2478,THE “WANDERER”,On suffering men; we had not long to wait.
2479,THE “WANDERER”,
2480,THE “WANDERER”,"For soon the outcry of derision rose,"
2481,THE “WANDERER”,“Here comes the _Wanderer_!” the expected cry.
2482,THE “WANDERER”,"Guessing the cause, our mockings joined with those"
2483,THE “WANDERER”,Yelled from the shipping as they towed her by.
2484,THE “WANDERER”,
2485,THE “WANDERER”,"She passed us close, her seamen paid no heed"
2486,THE “WANDERER”,"To what was called: they stood, a sullen group,"
2487,THE “WANDERER”,"Smoking and spitting, careless of her need,"
2488,THE “WANDERER”,Mocking the orders given from the poop.
2489,THE “WANDERER”,
2490,THE “WANDERER”,Her mates and boys were working her; we stared.
2491,THE “WANDERER”,"What was the reason of this strange return,"
2492,THE “WANDERER”,This third annulling of the thing prepared?
2493,THE “WANDERER”,No outward evil could our eyes discern.
2494,THE “WANDERER”,
2495,THE “WANDERER”,Only like someone who has formed a plan
2496,THE “WANDERER”,"Beyond the pitch of common minds, she sailed,"
2497,THE “WANDERER”,"Mocked and deserted by the common man,"
2498,THE “WANDERER”,Made half divine to me for having failed.
2499,THE “WANDERER”,
2500,THE “WANDERER”,We learned the reason soon; below the town
2501,THE “WANDERER”,"A stay had parted like a snapping reed,"
2502,THE “WANDERER”,"“Warning,” the men thought, “not to take her down.”"
2503,THE “WANDERER”,"They took the omen, they would not proceed."
2504,THE “WANDERER”,
2505,THE “WANDERER”,Days passed before another crew would sign.
2506,THE “WANDERER”,"The _Wanderer_ lay in dock alone, unmanned,"
2507,THE “WANDERER”,"Feared as a thing possessed by powers malign,"
2508,THE “WANDERER”,Bound under curses not to leave the land.
2509,THE “WANDERER”,
2510,THE “WANDERER”,But under passing Time fear passes too;
2511,THE “WANDERER”,"That terror passed, the sailors’ hearts grew bold."
2512,THE “WANDERER”,We learned in time that she had found a crew
2513,THE “WANDERER”,And was bound out and southwards as of old.
2514,THE “WANDERER”,
2515,THE “WANDERER”,"And in contempt we thought, “A little while"
2516,THE “WANDERER”,"Will bring her back again, dismantled, spoiled."
2517,THE “WANDERER”,It is herself; she cannot change her style;
2518,THE “WANDERER”,She has the habit now of being foiled.”
2519,THE “WANDERER”,
2520,THE “WANDERER”,"So when a ship appeared among the haze,"
2521,THE “WANDERER”,"We thought, “The _Wanderer_ back again”; but no,"
2522,THE “WANDERER”,"No _Wanderer_ showed for many, many days,"
2523,THE “WANDERER”,Her passing lights made other waters glow.
2524,THE “WANDERER”,
2525,THE “WANDERER”,"But we would often think and talk of her,"
2526,THE “WANDERER”,"Tell newer hands her story, wondering, then,"
2527,THE “WANDERER”,"Upon what ocean she was _Wanderer_,"
2528,THE “WANDERER”,Bound to the cities built by foreign men.
2529,THE “WANDERER”,
2530,THE “WANDERER”,"And one by one our little conclave thinned,"
2531,THE “WANDERER”,"Passed into ships and sailed and so away,"
2532,THE “WANDERER”,"To drown in some great roaring of the wind,"
2533,THE “WANDERER”,"Wanderers themselves, unhappy fortune’s prey."
2534,THE “WANDERER”,
2535,THE “WANDERER”,"And Time went by me making memory dim,"
2536,THE “WANDERER”,Yet still I wondered if the _Wanderer_ fared
2537,THE “WANDERER”,"Still pointing to the unreached ocean’s rim,"
2538,THE “WANDERER”,Brightening the water where her breast was bared.
2539,THE “WANDERER”,
2540,THE “WANDERER”,"And much in ports abroad I eyed the ships,"
2541,THE “WANDERER”,Hoping to see her well-remembered form
2542,THE “WANDERER”,Come with a curl of bubbles at her lips
2543,THE “WANDERER”,"Bright to her berth, the sovereign of the storm."
2544,THE “WANDERER”,
2545,THE “WANDERER”,"I never did, and many years went by,"
2546,THE “WANDERER”,"Then, near a Southern port, one Christmas Eve,"
2547,THE “WANDERER”,"I watched a gale go roaring through the sky,"
2548,THE “WANDERER”,Making the caldrons of the clouds upheave.
2549,THE “WANDERER”,
2550,THE “WANDERER”,"Then the wrack tattered and the stars appeared,"
2551,THE “WANDERER”,Millions of stars that seemed to speak in fire;
2552,THE “WANDERER”,"A byre cock cried aloud that morning neared,"
2553,THE “WANDERER”,The swinging wind-vane flashed upon the spire.
2554,THE “WANDERER”,
2555,THE “WANDERER”,"And soon men looked upon a glittering earth,"
2556,THE “WANDERER”,Intensely sparkling like a world new-born;
2557,THE “WANDERER”,"Only to look was spiritual birth,"
2558,THE “WANDERER”,So bright the raindrops ran along the thorn.
2559,THE “WANDERER”,
2560,THE “WANDERER”,"So bright they were, that one could almost pass"
2561,THE “WANDERER”,"Beyond their twinkling to the source, and know"
2562,THE “WANDERER”,"The glory pushing in the blade of grass,"
2563,THE “WANDERER”,That hidden soul which makes the flowers grow.
2564,THE “WANDERER”,
2565,THE “WANDERER”,"That soul was there apparent, not revealed,"
2566,THE “WANDERER”,"Unearthly meanings covered every tree,"
2567,THE “WANDERER”,"That wet grass grew in an immortal field,"
2568,THE “WANDERER”,Those waters fed some never-wrinkled sea.
2569,THE “WANDERER”,
2570,THE “WANDERER”,The scarlet berries in the hedge stood out
2571,THE “WANDERER”,Like revelations but the tongue unknown;
2572,THE “WANDERER”,Even in the brooks a joy was quick: the trout
2573,THE “WANDERER”,Rushed in a dumbness dumb to me alone.
2574,THE “WANDERER”,
2575,THE “WANDERER”,All of the valley was aloud with brooks;
2576,THE “WANDERER”,"I walked the morning, breasting up the fells,"
2577,THE “WANDERER”,"Taking again lost childhood from the rooks,"
2578,THE “WANDERER”,Whose cawing came above the Christmas bells.
2579,THE “WANDERER”,
2580,THE “WANDERER”,"I had not walked that glittering world before,"
2581,THE “WANDERER”,"But up the hill a prompting came to me,"
2582,THE “WANDERER”,“This line of upland runs along the shore:
2583,THE “WANDERER”,Beyond the hedgerow I shall see the sea.”
2584,THE “WANDERER”,
2585,THE “WANDERER”,And on the instant from beyond away
2586,THE “WANDERER”,"That long familiar sound, a ship’s bell, broke"
2587,THE “WANDERER”,The hush below me in the unseen bay.
2588,THE “WANDERER”,Old memories came: that inner prompting spoke.
2589,THE “WANDERER”,
2590,THE “WANDERER”,And bright above the hedge a seagull’s wings
2591,THE “WANDERER”,Flashed and were steady upon empty air.
2592,THE “WANDERER”,"“A Power unseen,” I cried, “prepares these things;"
2593,THE “WANDERER”,"“Those are her bells, the _Wanderer_ is there.”"
2594,THE “WANDERER”,
2595,THE “WANDERER”,"So, hurrying to the hedge and looking down,"
2596,THE “WANDERER”,I saw a mighty bay’s wind-crinkled blue
2597,THE “WANDERER”,"Ruffling the image of a tranquil town,"
2598,THE “WANDERER”,With lapsing waters glittering as they grew.
2599,THE “WANDERER”,
2600,THE “WANDERER”,"And near me in the road the shipping swung,"
2601,THE “WANDERER”,So stately and so still in such great peace
2602,THE “WANDERER”,"That like to drooping crests their colours hung,"
2603,THE “WANDERER”,Only their shadows trembled without cease.
2604,THE “WANDERER”,
2605,THE “WANDERER”,I did but glance upon those anchored ships.
2606,THE “WANDERER”,"Even as my thought had told, I saw her plain;"
2607,THE “WANDERER”,"Tense, like a supple athlete with lean hips,"
2608,THE “WANDERER”,"Swiftness at pause, the _Wanderer_ come again--"
2609,THE “WANDERER”,
2610,THE “WANDERER”,"Come as of old a queen, untouched by Time,"
2611,THE “WANDERER”,"Resting the beauty that no seas could tire,"
2612,THE “WANDERER”,"Sparkling, as though the midnight’s rain were rime,"
2613,THE “WANDERER”,Like a man’s thought transfigured into fire.
2614,THE “WANDERER”,
2615,THE “WANDERER”,"And as I looked, one of her men began"
2616,THE “WANDERER”,To sing some simple tune of Christmas Day;
2617,THE “WANDERER”,"Among her crew the song spread, man to man,"
2618,THE “WANDERER”,Until the singing rang across the bay;
2619,THE “WANDERER”,
2620,THE “WANDERER”,And soon in other anchored ships the men
2621,THE “WANDERER”,"Joined in the singing with clear throats, until"
2622,THE “WANDERER”,"The farm-boy heard it up the windy glen,"
2623,THE “WANDERER”,Above the noise of sheep-bells on the hill.
2624,THE “WANDERER”,
2625,THE “WANDERER”,Over the water came the lifted song--
2626,THE “WANDERER”,Blind pieces in a mighty game we swing;
2627,THE “WANDERER”,Life’s battle is a conquest for the strong;
2628,THE “WANDERER”,The meaning shows in the defeated thing.

2745,BIOGRAPHY,And none will know the gleam there used to be
2746,BIOGRAPHY,"About the feast-days freshly kept by me,"
2747,BIOGRAPHY,But men will call the golden hour of bliss
2748,BIOGRAPHY,"“About this time,” or “shortly after this.”"
2749,BIOGRAPHY,
2750,BIOGRAPHY,Men do not heed the rungs by which men climb
2751,BIOGRAPHY,"Those glittering steps, those milestones upon Time,"
2752,BIOGRAPHY,"Those tombstones of dead selves, those hours of birth,"
2753,BIOGRAPHY,Those moments of the soul in years of earth.
2754,BIOGRAPHY,"They mark the height achieved, the main result,"
2755,BIOGRAPHY,"The power of freedom in the perished cult,"
2756,BIOGRAPHY,"The power of boredom in the dead man’s deeds,"
2757,BIOGRAPHY,Not the bright moments of the sprinkled seeds.
2758,BIOGRAPHY,
2759,BIOGRAPHY,By many waters and on many ways
2760,BIOGRAPHY,I have known golden instants and bright days;
2761,BIOGRAPHY,"The day on which, beneath an arching sail,"
2762,BIOGRAPHY,I saw the Cordilleras and gave hail;
2763,BIOGRAPHY,The summer day on which in heart’s delight
2764,BIOGRAPHY,I saw the Swansea Mumbles bursting white;
2765,BIOGRAPHY,"The glittering day when all the waves wore flags,"
2766,BIOGRAPHY,And the ship _Wanderer_ came with sails in rags;
2767,BIOGRAPHY,"That curlew-calling time in Irish dusk,"
2768,BIOGRAPHY,"When life became more splendid than its husk,"
2769,BIOGRAPHY,When the rent chapel on the brae at Slains
2770,BIOGRAPHY,Shone with a doorway opening beyond brains;
2771,BIOGRAPHY,"The dawn when, with a brace-block’s creaking cry,"
2772,BIOGRAPHY,"Out of the mist a little barque slipped by,"
2773,BIOGRAPHY,"Spilling the mist with changing gleams of red,"
2774,BIOGRAPHY,"Then gone, with one raised hand and one turned head;"
2775,BIOGRAPHY,The howling evening when the spindrift’s mists
2776,BIOGRAPHY,"Broke to display the Four Evangelists,"
2777,BIOGRAPHY,"Snow-capped, divinely granite, lashed by breakers,"
2778,BIOGRAPHY,Wind-beaten bones of long since buried acres;
2779,BIOGRAPHY,The night alone near water when I heard
2780,BIOGRAPHY,All the sea’s spirit spoken by a bird;
2781,BIOGRAPHY,The English dusk when I beheld once more
2782,BIOGRAPHY,"(With eyes so changed) the ship, the citied shore,"
2783,BIOGRAPHY,"The lines of masts, the streets so cheerly trod"
2784,BIOGRAPHY,"(In happier seasons), and gave thanks to God."
2785,BIOGRAPHY,"All had their beauty, their bright moments’ gift,"
2786,BIOGRAPHY,"Their something caught from Time, the ever-swift."
2787,BIOGRAPHY,
2788,BIOGRAPHY,All of those gleams were golden; but life’s hands
2789,BIOGRAPHY,"Have given more constant gifts in changing lands,"
2790,BIOGRAPHY,"And when I count those gifts, I think them such"
2791,BIOGRAPHY,As no man’s bounty could have bettered much:
2792,BIOGRAPHY,"The gift of country life, near hills and woods,"
2793,BIOGRAPHY,Where happy waters sing in solitudes;
2794,BIOGRAPHY,"The gift of being near ships, of seeing each day"
2795,BIOGRAPHY,A city of ships with great ships under weigh;
2796,BIOGRAPHY,"The great street paved with water, filled with shipping,"
2797,BIOGRAPHY,And all the world’s flags flying and seagulls dipping.
2798,BIOGRAPHY,
2799,BIOGRAPHY,Yet when I am dust my penman may not know
2800,BIOGRAPHY,"Those water-trampling ships which made me glow,"
2801,BIOGRAPHY,But think my wonder mad and fail to find
2802,BIOGRAPHY,"Their glory, even dimly, from my mind,"
2803,BIOGRAPHY,"And yet they made me. Not alone the ships,"
2804,BIOGRAPHY,"But men hard-palmed from tallying-on to whips,"
2805,BIOGRAPHY,"The two close friends of nearly twenty years,"
2806,BIOGRAPHY,"Sea-followers both, sea-wrestlers and sea-peers,"
2807,BIOGRAPHY,Whose feet with mine wore many a bolthead bright
2808,BIOGRAPHY,Treading the decks beneath the riding light.
2809,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet death will make that warmth of friendship cold,"
2810,BIOGRAPHY,And who’ll know what one said and what one told
2811,BIOGRAPHY,Our hearts’ communion and the broken spells
2812,BIOGRAPHY,When the loud call blew at the strike of bells?

2820,BIOGRAPHY,Away from all bright water and great hills
2821,BIOGRAPHY,"And sheep-walks, where the curlews cry their fills;"
2822,BIOGRAPHY,"Away in towns, where eyes have nought to see"
2823,BIOGRAPHY,"But dead museums and miles of misery,"
2824,BIOGRAPHY,"And floating life unrooted from man’s need,"
2825,BIOGRAPHY,"And miles of fish-hooks baited to catch greed,"
2826,BIOGRAPHY,"And life made wretched out of human ken,"
2827,BIOGRAPHY,And miles of shopping women served by men.
2828,BIOGRAPHY,"So, if the penman sums my London days,"
2829,BIOGRAPHY,"Let him but say that there were holy ways,"
2830,BIOGRAPHY,"Dull Bloomsbury streets of dull brick mansions old,"
2831,BIOGRAPHY,"With stinking doors, where women stood to scold,"
2832,BIOGRAPHY,"And drunken waits at Christmas with their horn,"
2833,BIOGRAPHY,"Droning the news, in snow, that Christ was born;"
2834,BIOGRAPHY,"And windy gas-lamps and the wet roads shining,"
2835,BIOGRAPHY,"And that old carol of the midnight whining,"
2836,BIOGRAPHY,"And that old room (above the noisy slum),"
2837,BIOGRAPHY,Where there was wine and fire and talk with some
2838,BIOGRAPHY,"Under strange pictures of the wakened soul,"
2839,BIOGRAPHY,To whom this earth was but a burnt-out coal.
2840,BIOGRAPHY,
2841,BIOGRAPHY,"O Time, bring back those midnights and those friends,"
2842,BIOGRAPHY,"Those glittering moments that a spirit lends,"
2843,BIOGRAPHY,"That all may be imagined from the flash,"
2844,BIOGRAPHY,"The cloud-hid god-game through the lightning gash,"
2845,BIOGRAPHY,Those hours of stricken sparks from which men took
2846,BIOGRAPHY,Light to send out to men in song or book.
2847,BIOGRAPHY,
2848,BIOGRAPHY,Those friends who heard St. Pancras’s bells strike two
2849,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet stayed until the barber’s cockerel crew,"
2850,BIOGRAPHY,"Talking of noble styles, the Frenchman’s best,"
2851,BIOGRAPHY,"The thought beyond great poets not expressed,"
2852,BIOGRAPHY,"The glory of mood where human frailty failed,"
2853,BIOGRAPHY,"The forts of human light not yet assailed,"
2854,BIOGRAPHY,"Till the dim room had mind, and seemed to brood,"
2855,BIOGRAPHY,"Binding our wills to mental brotherhood,"
2856,BIOGRAPHY,"Till we became a college, and each night"
2857,BIOGRAPHY,"Was discipline and manhood and delight,"
2858,BIOGRAPHY,"Till our farewells, and winding down the stairs"
2859,BIOGRAPHY,"At each grey dawn had meaning that Time spares,"
2860,BIOGRAPHY,"That we, so linked, should roam the whole world round"
2861,BIOGRAPHY,"Teaching the ways our brooding minds had found,"
2862,BIOGRAPHY,"Making that room our Chapter, our one mind,"
2863,BIOGRAPHY,Where all that this world soiled should be refined.
2864,BIOGRAPHY,
2865,BIOGRAPHY,"Often at night I tread those streets again,"
2866,BIOGRAPHY,And see the alley glimmering in the rain;
2867,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet now I miss that sign of earlier tramps,"
2868,BIOGRAPHY,"A house with shadows of plane-boughs under lamps,"
2869,BIOGRAPHY,The secret house where once a beggar stood
2870,BIOGRAPHY,Trembling and blind to show his woe for food.
2871,BIOGRAPHY,And now I miss that friend who used to walk
2872,BIOGRAPHY,"Home to my lodgings with me, deep in talk,"
2873,BIOGRAPHY,Wearing the last of night out in still streets
2874,BIOGRAPHY,Trodden by us and policemen on their beats
2875,BIOGRAPHY,"And cats, but else deserted. Now I miss"
2876,BIOGRAPHY,"That lively mind and guttural laugh of his,"
2877,BIOGRAPHY,"And that strange way he had of making gleam,"
2878,BIOGRAPHY,"Like something real, the art we used to dream."
2879,BIOGRAPHY,"London has been my prison; but my books,"
2880,BIOGRAPHY,"Hills and great waters, labouring men and brooks,"
2881,BIOGRAPHY,"Ships and deep friendships, and remembered days,"
2882,BIOGRAPHY,"Which even now set all my mind ablaze,"
2883,BIOGRAPHY,"As that June day when, in the red bricks’ chinks,"
2884,BIOGRAPHY,"I saw the old Roman ruins white with pinks,"
2885,BIOGRAPHY,And felt the hillside haunted even then
2886,BIOGRAPHY,By not dead memory of the Roman men.
2887,BIOGRAPHY,"And felt the hillside thronged by souls unseen,"
2888,BIOGRAPHY,"Who knew the interest in me, and were keen"
2889,BIOGRAPHY,"That man alive should understand man dead,"
2890,BIOGRAPHY,So many centuries since the blood was shed.
2891,BIOGRAPHY,And quickened with strange hush because this comer
2892,BIOGRAPHY,Felt a strange soul alive behind the summer.
2893,BIOGRAPHY,That other day on Ercall when the stones
2894,BIOGRAPHY,"Were sunbleached white, like long unburied bones,"
2895,BIOGRAPHY,While the bees droned and all the air was sweet
2896,BIOGRAPHY,From honey buried underneath my feet.
2897,BIOGRAPHY,Honey of purple heather and white clover
2898,BIOGRAPHY,Sealed in its gummy bags till summer’s over.
2899,BIOGRAPHY,"Then other days by water, by bright sea,"
2900,BIOGRAPHY,"Clear as clean glass and my bright friend with me,"
2901,BIOGRAPHY,The cove clean bottomed where we saw the brown
2902,BIOGRAPHY,Red spotted plaice go skimming six feet down
2903,BIOGRAPHY,"And saw the long fronds waving, white with shells,"
2904,BIOGRAPHY,"Waving, unfolding, drooping, to the swells;"
2905,BIOGRAPHY,That sadder day when we beheld the great
2906,BIOGRAPHY,And terrible beauty of a Lammas spate
2907,BIOGRAPHY,Roaring white-mouthed in all the great cliff’s gaps
2908,BIOGRAPHY,"Headlong, tree-tumbling fury of collapse,"
2909,BIOGRAPHY,While drenching clouds drove by and every sense
2910,BIOGRAPHY,Was water roaring or rushing or in offence
2911,BIOGRAPHY,And mountain sheep stood huddled and blown gaps gleamed
2912,BIOGRAPHY,Where torn white hair of torrents shook and streamed.
2913,BIOGRAPHY,That sadder day when we beheld again
2914,BIOGRAPHY,"A spate going down in sunshine after rain,"
2915,BIOGRAPHY,When the blue reach of water leaping bright
2916,BIOGRAPHY,"Was one long ripple and clatter, flecked with white,"
2917,BIOGRAPHY,"And that far day, that never blotted page"
2918,BIOGRAPHY,"When youth was bright like flowers about old age,"
2919,BIOGRAPHY,Fair generations bringing thanks for life
2920,BIOGRAPHY,To that old kindly man and trembling wife
2921,BIOGRAPHY,After their sixty years: Time never made
2922,BIOGRAPHY,"A better beauty since the Earth was laid,"
2923,BIOGRAPHY,Than that thanksgiving given to grey hair
2924,BIOGRAPHY,For the great gift of life which brought them there.
2925,BIOGRAPHY,
2926,BIOGRAPHY,Days of endeavour have been good: the days
2927,BIOGRAPHY,"Racing in cutters for the comrade’s praise,"
2928,BIOGRAPHY,The day they led my cutter at the turn
2929,BIOGRAPHY,Yet could not keep the lead and dropped astern.
2930,BIOGRAPHY,"The moment in the spurt when both boats, oars"
2931,BIOGRAPHY,Dipped in each other’s wash and throats grew hoarse
2932,BIOGRAPHY,And teeth ground into teeth and both strokes quickened
2933,BIOGRAPHY,"Lashing the sea, and gasps came, and hearts sickened"
2934,BIOGRAPHY,"And coxwains damned us, dancing, banking stroke,"
2935,BIOGRAPHY,"To put our weights on, though our hearts were broke"
2936,BIOGRAPHY,"And both boats seemed to stick and sea seemed glue,"
2937,BIOGRAPHY,The tide a mill-race we were struggling through
2938,BIOGRAPHY,And every quick recover gave us squints
2939,BIOGRAPHY,"Of them still there and oar-tossed water-glints,"
2940,BIOGRAPHY,"And cheering came, our friends, our foemen cheering,"
2941,BIOGRAPHY,"A long, wild, rallying murmur on the hearing"
2942,BIOGRAPHY,“Port Fore!” and “Starboard Fore!” “Port Fore!” “Port Fore!”
2943,BIOGRAPHY,"“Up with her, Starboard,” and at that each oar"
2944,BIOGRAPHY,"Lightened, though arms were bursting, and eyes shut"
2945,BIOGRAPHY,"And the oak stretchers grunted in the strut,"
2946,BIOGRAPHY,"And the curse quickened from the cox, our bows"
2947,BIOGRAPHY,"Crashed, and drove talking water, we made vows,"
2948,BIOGRAPHY,Chastity vows and temperance; in our pain
2949,BIOGRAPHY,We numbered things we’d never eat again
2950,BIOGRAPHY,If we could only win; then came the yell
2951,BIOGRAPHY,"“Starboard,” “Port Fore,” and then a beaten bell"
2952,BIOGRAPHY,Rung as for fire to cheer us. “Now.” Oars bent
2953,BIOGRAPHY,"Soul took the looms now body’s bolt was spent,"
2954,BIOGRAPHY,"“Give way, come on now!” “On now!” “On now!” “Starboard.”"
2955,BIOGRAPHY,"“Port Fore!” “Up with her, Port!” each cutter harboured"
2956,BIOGRAPHY,"Ten eye-shut painsick strugglers, “Heave, oh, heave!”"
2957,BIOGRAPHY,Catcalls waked echoes like a shrieking sheave.
2958,BIOGRAPHY,"“Heave!” and I saw a back, then two. “Port Fore.”"
2959,BIOGRAPHY,“Starboard!” “Come on!” I saw the midship oar
2960,BIOGRAPHY,And knew we had done them. “Port Fore!” “Starboard!” “Now!”
2961,BIOGRAPHY,I saw bright water spurting at their bow
2962,BIOGRAPHY,Their cox’ full face an instant. They were done.
2963,BIOGRAPHY,The watchers’ cheering almost drowned the gun.
2964,BIOGRAPHY,We had hardly strength to toss our oars; our cry
2965,BIOGRAPHY,Cheering the losing cutter was a sigh.
2966,BIOGRAPHY,
2967,BIOGRAPHY,Other bright days of action have seemed great:
2968,BIOGRAPHY,Wild days in a pampero off the Plate;
2969,BIOGRAPHY,"Good swimming days, at Hog Back or the Coves"
2970,BIOGRAPHY,Which the young gannet and the corbie loves;
2971,BIOGRAPHY,"Surf-swimming between rollers, catching breath"
2972,BIOGRAPHY,"Between the advancing grave and breaking death,"
2973,BIOGRAPHY,Then shooting up into the sunbright smooth
2974,BIOGRAPHY,"To watch the advancing roller bare her tooth,"
2975,BIOGRAPHY,"And days of labour also, loading, hauling;"
2976,BIOGRAPHY,"Long days at winch or capstan, heaving, pawling;"
2977,BIOGRAPHY,"The days with oxen, dragging stone from blasting,"
2978,BIOGRAPHY,"And dusty days in mills, and hot days masting."
2979,BIOGRAPHY,"Trucking on dust-dry deckings smooth like ice,"
2980,BIOGRAPHY,And hunts in mighty wool-racks after mice;
2981,BIOGRAPHY,Mornings with buckwheat when the fields did blanch
2982,BIOGRAPHY,With White Leghorns come from the chicken ranch.
2983,BIOGRAPHY,"Days near the spring upon the sunburnt hill,"
2984,BIOGRAPHY,Plying the maul or gripping tight the drill.
2985,BIOGRAPHY,"Delights of work most real, delights that change"
2986,BIOGRAPHY,The headache life of towns to rapture strange
2987,BIOGRAPHY,"Not known by townsmen, nor imagined; health"
2988,BIOGRAPHY,That puts new glory upon mental wealth
2989,BIOGRAPHY,"And makes the poor man rich. But that ends, too,"
2990,BIOGRAPHY,"Health with its thoughts of life; and that bright view,"
2991,BIOGRAPHY,"That sunny landscape from life’s peak, that glory,"
2992,BIOGRAPHY,"And all a glad man’s comments on life’s story,"
2993,BIOGRAPHY,"And thoughts of marvellous towns and living men,"
2994,BIOGRAPHY,"And what pens tell and all beyond the pen,"
2995,BIOGRAPHY,"End, and are summed in words so truly dead,"
2996,BIOGRAPHY,"They raise no image of the heart and head,"
2997,BIOGRAPHY,"The life, the man alive, the friend we knew,"
2998,BIOGRAPHY,"The mind ours argued with or listened to,"
2999,BIOGRAPHY,"None; but are dead, and all life’s keenness, all,"
3000,BIOGRAPHY,"Is dead as print before the funeral,"
3001,BIOGRAPHY,"Even deader after, when the dates are sought,"
3002,BIOGRAPHY,And cold minds disagree with what we thought.
3003,BIOGRAPHY,
3004,BIOGRAPHY,This many-pictured world of many passions
3005,BIOGRAPHY,"Wears out the nations as a woman fashions,"
3006,BIOGRAPHY,"And what life is is much to very few,"
3007,BIOGRAPHY,"Men being so strange, so mad, and what men do"
3008,BIOGRAPHY,So good to watch or share; but when men count
3009,BIOGRAPHY,"Those hours of life that were a bursting fount,"
3010,BIOGRAPHY,"Sparkling the dusty heart with living springs,"
3011,BIOGRAPHY,"There seems a world, beyond our earthly things,"
3012,BIOGRAPHY,"Gated by golden moments, each bright time"
3013,BIOGRAPHY,"Opening to show the city white like lime,"
3014,BIOGRAPHY,"High-towered and many-peopled. This made sure,"
3015,BIOGRAPHY,"Work that obscures those moments seems impure,"
3016,BIOGRAPHY,Making our not-returning time of breath
3017,BIOGRAPHY,"Dull with the ritual and records of death,"
3018,BIOGRAPHY,That frost of fact by which our wisdom gives
3019,BIOGRAPHY,Correctly stated death to all that lives.
3020,BIOGRAPHY,
3021,BIOGRAPHY,Best trust the happy moments. What they gave
3022,BIOGRAPHY,"Makes man less fearful of the certain grave,"
3023,BIOGRAPHY,"And gives his work compassion and new eyes,"
3024,BIOGRAPHY,The days that make us happy make us wise.
3025,BIOGRAPHY,

3029,SHIPS,SHIPS
3030,SHIPS,
3031,SHIPS,
3032,SHIPS,I cannot tell their wonder nor make known
3033,SHIPS,"Magic that once thrilled through me to the bone,"
3034,SHIPS,"But all men praise some beauty, tell some tale,"
3035,SHIPS,"Vent a high mood which makes the rest seem pale,"
3036,SHIPS,"Pour their heart’s blood to flourish one green leaf,"
3037,SHIPS,"Follow some Helen for her gift of grief,"
3038,SHIPS,"And fail in what they mean, whate’er they do:"
3039,SHIPS,"You should have seen, man cannot tell to you"
3040,SHIPS,The beauty of the ships of that my city.
3041,SHIPS,
3042,SHIPS,That beauty now is spoiled by the sea’s pity:
3043,SHIPS,For one may haunt the pier a score of times
3044,SHIPS,"Hearing St. Nicholas’ bells ring out the chimes,"
3045,SHIPS,"Yet never see those proud ones swaying home,"
3046,SHIPS,"With mainyards backed and bows a cream of foam,"
3047,SHIPS,"Those bows so lovely-curving, cut so fine"
3048,SHIPS,"Those coulters of the many-bubbled brine,"
3049,SHIPS,"As once, long since, when all the docks were filled"
3050,SHIPS,With that sea beauty man has ceased to build.
3051,SHIPS,
3052,SHIPS,"Yet though their splendour may have ceased to be,"
3053,SHIPS,Each played her sovereign part in making me.
3054,SHIPS,Now I return my thanks with heart and lips
3055,SHIPS,For the great queenliness of all those ships.
3056,SHIPS,"And first the first bright memory, still so clear,"
3057,SHIPS,"An autumn evening in a golden year,"
3058,SHIPS,When in the last lit moments before dark
3059,SHIPS,"The _Chepica_, a steel-gray lovely barque,"
3060,SHIPS,"Her trucks aloft in sun-glow red as blood,"
3061,SHIPS,Came to an anchor near us on the flood.
3062,SHIPS,Then come so many ships that I could fill
3063,SHIPS,"Three docks with their fair hulls remembered still,"
3064,SHIPS,"Each with her special memory’s special grace,"
3065,SHIPS,"Riding the sea, making the waves give place"
3066,SHIPS,To delicate high beauty; man’s best strength
3067,SHIPS,Noble in every line in all their length.
3068,SHIPS,"_Ailsa_, _Genista_, ships, with long jib-booms,"
3069,SHIPS,"The _Wanderer_ with great beauty and strange dooms,"
3070,SHIPS,"_Liverpool_ (mightiest then) superb, sublime,"
3071,SHIPS,"The _California_ huge, as slow as Time."
3072,SHIPS,"The _Cutty Sark_, the perfect _J. T. North_,"
3073,SHIPS,The loveliest barque my city has sent forth.
3074,SHIPS,"Dainty _Redgauntlet_, well remembered yet,"
3075,SHIPS,"The splendid _Argus_ with her skysail set,"
3076,SHIPS,"Stalwart _Drumcliff_, white-blocked majestic _Sierras_,"
3077,SHIPS,"Divine bright ships, the water’s standard bearers."
3078,SHIPS,"_Melpomene_, _Euphrosyne_, and their sweet"
3079,SHIPS,Sea-troubling sisters of the Fernie Fleet.
3080,SHIPS,_Corunna_ (in whom my friend died) and the old
3081,SHIPS,Long since loved _Esmeralda_ long since sold.
3082,SHIPS,"_Centurion_ passed in Rio, _Glaucus_ spoken,"
3083,SHIPS,"_Aladdin_ burnt, the _Bidston_ water broken,"
3084,SHIPS,"_Yola_ in whom my friend sailed, _Dawpool_ trim,"
3085,SHIPS,"Fierce-bowed _Egeria_ plunging to the swim,"
3086,SHIPS,"_Stanmore_ wide-sterned, sweet _Cupica_, tall _Bard_"
3087,SHIPS,Queen in all harbours with her moonsail yard.
3088,SHIPS,
3089,SHIPS,"Though I tell many there must still be others,"
3090,SHIPS,McVickar Marshall’s ships and Fernie Brothers’
3091,SHIPS,"_Lochs_, _Counties_, _Shires_, _Drums_, the countless lines"
3092,SHIPS,Whose house-flags all were once familiar signs
3093,SHIPS,At high main trucks on Mersey’s windy ways
3094,SHIPS,When sun made all the wind-white water blaze.
3095,SHIPS,Their names bring back old mornings when the docks
3096,SHIPS,"Shone with their house-flags and their painted blocks,"
3097,SHIPS,Their raking masts below the Custom House
3098,SHIPS,And all the marvellous beauty of their bows.
3099,SHIPS,
3100,SHIPS,"Familiar steamers, too, majestic steamers,"
3101,SHIPS,Shearing Atlantic roller-tops to streamers
3102,SHIPS,"_Umbria_, _Etruria_, noble, still at sea,"
3103,SHIPS,"The grandest, then, that man had brought to be"
3104,SHIPS,"_Majestic_, _City of Paris_, _City of Rome_,"
3105,SHIPS,"Forever jealous racers, out and home."
3106,SHIPS,"The Alfred Holt’s blue smokestacks down the stream,"
3107,SHIPS,The fair _Arabian_ with her bows a-cream.
3108,SHIPS,"Booth liners, Anchor liners, Red Star liners,"
3109,SHIPS,The marks and styles of countless ship designers.
3110,SHIPS,"The _Magdalena_, _Puno_, _Potosi_,"
3111,SHIPS,"Lost _Cotopaxi_, all well known to me."
3112,SHIPS,
3113,SHIPS,"These splendid ships, each with her grace, her glory,"
3114,SHIPS,"Her memory of old song or comrade’s story,"
3115,SHIPS,"Still in my mind the image of life’s need,"
3116,SHIPS,"Beauty in hardest action, beauty indeed."
3117,SHIPS,"“They built great ships and sailed them” sounds most brave,"
3118,SHIPS,Whatever arts we have or fail to have;
3119,SHIPS,"I touch my country’s mind, I come to grips"
3120,SHIPS,With half her purpose thinking of these ships.
3121,SHIPS,
3122,SHIPS,"That art untouched by softness, all that line"
3123,SHIPS,Drawn ringing hard to stand the test of brine;
3124,SHIPS,"That nobleness and grandeur, all that beauty"
3125,SHIPS,Born of a manly life and bitter duty;
3126,SHIPS,That splendour of fine bows which yet could stand
3127,SHIPS,The shock of rollers never checked by land.
3128,SHIPS,"That art of masts, sail-crowded, fit to break,"
3129,SHIPS,"Yet stayed to strength, and back-stayed into rake,"
3130,SHIPS,"The life demanded by that art, the keen"
3131,SHIPS,"Eye-puckered, hard-case seamen, silent, lean,"
3132,SHIPS,"They are grander things than all the art of towns,"
3133,SHIPS,Their tests are tempests and the sea that drowns.
3134,SHIPS,"They are my country’s line, her great art done"
3135,SHIPS,"By strong brains labouring on the thought unwon,"
3136,SHIPS,"They mark our passage as a race of men,"
3137,SHIPS,Earth will not see such ships as those agen.

3241,(FROM THE SPANISH OF DON GUSTAVO A. BECQUÉR),A niche at one end;

3253,(FROM THE SPANISH OF DON GUSTAVO A. BECQUÉR),"Alone in darkness,"

3302,MADMAN,"Once I wore silk, drank wine,"

3319,MADMAN,"This changing veil to that which does not change,"
3320,MADMAN,My tired feet will range
3321,MADMAN,In some green valley of eternal mind
3322,MADMAN,Where Truth is daily like the water’s song.

3380,MADMAN,"Beyond the pain, beyond the broken clay,"
3381,MADMAN,A glimmering country lies

3435,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3436,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Out of the special cell’s most special sense
3437,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Came the suggestion when the light was sweet;
3438,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"All skill, all beauty, all magnificence,"
3439,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Are hints so caught, man’s glimpse of the complete."
3440,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And, though the body rots, that sense survives;"
3441,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Being of life’s own essence, it endures"
3442,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,(Fruit of the spirit’s tillage in men’s lives)
3443,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Round all this ghost that wandering flesh immures.
3444,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"That is our friend, who, when the iron brain"
3445,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Assails, or the earth clogs, or the sun hides,"

3472,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or a vast balance by vast clashes wrought?
3473,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or Time at trial with Matter for an hour?
3474,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or is it all a body where the cells
3475,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Are living things supporting something strange,"
3476,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Whose mighty heart the singing planet swells

3484,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,His golden touch is life to everyone.
3485,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,His power it is that makes us spin through space;
3486,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,His youth is April and his manhood bread;

3498,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,This soul of man upon whose fragile shells
3499,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Of blood and brain his very powers depend?
3500,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Pour out its little blood or touch its brain,"
3501,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The thing is helpless, gone, no longer known;"
3502,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The carrion cells are never man again,"
3503,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,No hand relights the little candle blown.
3504,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"It comes not from Without, but from the sperm"
3505,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Fed in the womb; it is a man-made thing
3506,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"That takes from man its power to live a term,"
3507,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Served by live cells of which it is the King.
3508,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Can it be blood and brain? It is most great.
3509,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Through blood and brain alone it wrestles Fate.
3510,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3511,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Can it be blood and brain, this transient force"
3512,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Which, by an impulse, seizes flesh and grows"
3513,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To man, the thing less splendid than the horse,"
3514,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"More blind than owls, less lovely than the rose?"
3515,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"O, by a power unknown it works the cells"
3516,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Of blood and brain; it has the power to see
3517,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Beyond the apparent thing the something else
3518,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Which it inspires dust to bring to be.
3519,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Both blood and brain are its imperfect tools,"
3520,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Easily wrecked, soon worn, slow to attain;"
3521,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Only by years of toil the master rules
3522,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To lovely ends those servants, blood and brain."
3523,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And Death, a touch, a germ, has still the force"
3524,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To make him ev’n as the rose, the owl, the horse."
3525,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3526,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Not only blood and brain its servants are;
3527,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There is a finer power that needs no slaves,"
3528,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Whose lovely service distance cannot bar,"
3529,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Nor the green sea with all her hell of waves;
3530,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Nor snowy mountains, nor the desert sand,"
3531,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Nor heat, nor storm, it bends to no control;"
3532,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,It is a stretching of the spirit’s hand
3533,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,To touch the brother’s or the sister’s soul;
3534,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,So that from darkness in the narrow room
3535,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I can step forth and be about her heart,"
3536,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Needing no star, no lantern in the gloom,"
3537,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"No word from her, no pointing on the chart,"
3538,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Only red knowledge of a window flung
3539,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Wide to the night, and calling without tongue."
3540,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3541,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Here in the self is all that man can know
3542,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Of Beauty, all the wonder, all the power,"
3543,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"All the unearthly colour, all the glow,"
3544,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Here in the self which withers like a flower;
3545,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Here in the self which fades as hours pass,"
3546,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And droops and dies and rots and is forgotten
3547,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Sooner, by ages, than the mirroring glass"
3548,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,In which it sees its glory still unrotten.
3549,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Here in the flesh, within the flesh, behind,"
3550,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Swift in the blood and throbbing on the bone,"
3551,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Beauty herself, the universal mind,"
3552,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Eternal April wandering alone;
3553,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The God, the holy Ghost, the atoning Lord,"
3554,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Here in the flesh, the never yet explored."
3555,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3556,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Flesh, I have knocked at many a dusty door,"
3557,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Gone down full many a windy midnight lane,"
3558,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Probed in old walls and felt along the floor,"
3559,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Pressed in blind hope the lighted window-pane.
3560,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"But useless all, though sometimes when the moon"
3561,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Was full in heaven and the sea was full,"
3562,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Along my body’s alleys came a tune
3563,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Played in the tavern by the Beautiful.
3564,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Then for an instant I have felt at point
3565,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To find and seize her, whosoe’er she be,"
3566,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Whether some saint whose glory doth anoint
3567,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Those whom she loves, or but a part of me,"
3568,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or something that the things not understood
3569,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Make for their uses out of flesh and blood.
3570,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3571,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"But all has passed, the tune has died away,"
3572,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The glamour gone, the glory; is it chance?"
3573,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Is the unfeeling mud stabbed by a ray
3574,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Cast by an unseen splendour’s great advance?
3575,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or does the glory gather crumb by crumb
3576,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Unseen, within, as coral islands rise,"
3577,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Till suddenly the apparitions come
3578,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Above the surface, looking at the skies?"
3579,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or does sweet Beauty dwell in lovely things
3580,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Scattering the holy hintings of her name
3581,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"In women, in dear friends, in flowers, in springs,"
3582,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"In the brook’s voice, for us to catch the same?"
3583,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Or is it we who are Beauty, we who ask?"
3584,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,We by whose gleams the world fulfils its task.
3585,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3586,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"These myriad days, these many thousand hours,"
3587,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A man’s long life, so choked with dusty things,"
3588,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"How little perfect poise with perfect powers,"
3589,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Joy at the heart and Beauty at the springs.
3590,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"One hour, or two, or three, in long years scattered"
3591,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Sparks from a smithy that have fired a thatch,"
3592,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Are all that life has given and all that mattered;
3593,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The rest, all heaving at a moveless latch."
3594,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"For these, so many years of useless toil,"
3595,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Despair, endeavour, and again despair,"
3596,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Sweat, that the base machine may have its oil,"
3597,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Idle delight to tempt one everywhere.
3598,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A life upon the cross. To make amends,"
3599,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Three flaming memories that the deathbed ends.
3600,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3601,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There, on the darkened deathbed, dies the brain"
3602,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,That flared three several times in seventy years.
3603,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"It cannot lift the silly hand again,"
3604,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Nor speak, nor sing, it neither sees nor hears;"
3605,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And muffled mourners put it in the ground
3606,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And then go home, and in the earth it lies"
3607,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Too dark for vision and too deep for sound,"
3608,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The million cells that made a good man wise.
3609,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Yet for a few short years an influence stirs,"
3610,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A sense or wraith or essence of him dead,"
3611,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Which makes insensate things its ministers
3612,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To those beloved, his spirit’s daily bread;"
3613,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Then that, too, fades; in book or deed a spark"
3614,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Lingers, then that, too, fades; then all is dark."
3615,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3616,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"So in the empty sky the stars appear,"
3617,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Are bright in heaven marching through the sky,"
3618,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Spinning their planets, each one to his year,"
3619,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Tossing their fiery hair until they die;
3620,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Then in the tower afar the watcher sees
3621,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The sun, that burned, less noble than it was,"
3622,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Less noble still, until by dim degrees"
3623,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,No spark of him is specklike in his glass.
3624,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Then blind and dark in heaven the sun proceeds,"
3625,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Vast, dead and hideous, knocking on his moons,"
3626,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Till crashing on his like creation breeds,"
3627,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Striking such life, a constellation swoons;"
3628,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"From dead things striking fire a new sun springs,"
3629,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"New fire, new life, new planets with new wings."
3630,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3631,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"It may be so with us, that in the dark,"
3632,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"When we have done with time and wander space,"
3633,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Some meeting of the blind may strike a spark,"
3634,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And to Death’s empty mansion give a grace.
3635,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"It may be, that the loosened soul may find"
3636,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Some new delight of living without limbs,"
3637,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Bodiless joy of flesh-untrammelled mind,"
3638,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Peace like a sky where starlike spirit swims.
3639,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"It may be, that the million cells of sense,"
3640,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Loosed from their seventy years’ adhesion, pass"
3641,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Each to some joy of changed experience,"
3642,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Weight in the earth or glory in the grass.
3643,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"It may be, that we cease; we cannot tell."
3644,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Even if we cease, life is a miracle."
3645,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3646,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt"
3647,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Held in cohesion by unresting cells
3648,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Which work they know not why, which never halt,"
3649,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Myself unwitting where their master dwells.
3650,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I do not bid them, yet they toil, they spin:"
3651,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A world which uses me as I use them,"
3652,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Nor do I know which end or which begin,"
3653,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Nor which to praise, which pamper, which condemn."
3654,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"So, like a marvel in a marvel set,"
3655,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I answer to the vast, as wave by wave"
3656,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The sea of air goes over, dry or wet,"
3657,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Or the full moon comes swimming from her cave,"
3658,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Or the great sun comes north, this myriad I"
3659,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Tingles, not knowing how, yet why."
3660,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3661,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"If I could get within this changing I,"
3662,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"This ever altering thing which yet persists,"
3663,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Keeping the features it is reckoned by,"
3664,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"While each component atom breaks or twists,"
3665,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"If, wandering past strange groups of shifting forms,"
3666,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Cells at their hidden marvels hard at work,"
3667,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Pale from much toil, or red from sudden storms,"
3668,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,I might attain to where the Rulers lurk.
3669,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"If, pressing past the guards in those grey gates,"
3670,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The brain’s most folded, intertwisted shell,"
3671,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I might attain to that which alters fates,"
3672,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The King, the supreme self, the Master Cell;"
3673,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Then, on Man’s earthly peak, I might behold"
3674,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The unearthly self beyond, unguessed, untold."
3675,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3676,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"What is this atom which contains the whole,"
3677,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"This miracle which needs adjuncts so strange,"
3678,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"This, which imagined God and is the soul,"
3679,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The steady star persisting amid change?
3680,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"What waste, that smallness of such power should need"
3681,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Such clumsy tools so easy to destroy,"
3682,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Such wasteful servants difficult to feed,"
3683,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Such indirect dark avenues to joy.
3684,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Why, if its business is not mainly earth,"
3685,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Should it demand such heavy chains to sense?
3686,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A heavenly thing demands a swifter birth,"
3687,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,A quicker hand to act intelligence;
3688,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"An earthly thing were better like the rose,"
3689,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,At peace with clay from which its beauty grows.
3690,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3691,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Ah, we are neither heaven nor earth, but men;"
3692,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Something that uses and despises both,"
3693,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"That takes its earth’s contentment in the pen,"
3694,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Then sees the world’s injustice and is wroth,"
3695,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And flinging off youth’s happy promise, flies"
3696,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Up to some breach, despising earthly things,"
3697,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And, in contempt of hell and heaven, dies"
3698,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Rather than bear some yoke of priests or kings
3699,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Our joys are not of heaven nor earth, but man’s,"
3700,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A woman’s beauty, or a child’s delight,"
3701,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The trembling blood when the discoverer scans
3702,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The sought-for world, the guessed-at satellite;"
3703,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The ringing scene, the stone at point to blush"
3704,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,For unborn men to look at and say “Hush.”
3705,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3706,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Roses are beauty, but I never see"
3707,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Those blood drops from the burning heart of June
3708,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Glowing like thought upon the living tree
3709,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Without a pity that they die so soon,"
3710,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Die into petals, like those roses old,"
3711,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Those women, who were summer in men’s hearts"
3712,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Before the smile upon the Sphinx was cold
3713,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or sand had hid the Syrian and his arts.
3714,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,O myriad dust of beauty that lies thick
3715,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Under our feet that not a single grain
3716,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,But stirred and moved in beauty and was quick
3717,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,For one brief moon and died nor lived again;
3718,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,But when the moon rose lay upon the grass
3719,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Pasture to living beauty, life that was."
3720,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3721,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Over the church’s door they moved a stone,"
3722,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And there, unguessed, forgotten, mortared up,"
3723,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Lay the priest’s cell where he had lived alone.
3724,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There was his ashy hearth, his drinking cup,"
3725,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There was his window whence he saw the Host,"
3726,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The God whose beauty quickened bread and wine;
3727,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The skeleton of a religion lost,"
3728,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The ghostless bones of what had been divine.
3729,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,O many a time the dusty masons come
3730,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Knocking their trowels in the stony brain
3731,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To cells where perished priests had once a home,"
3732,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Or where devout brows pressed the window pane,"
3733,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Watching the thing made God, the God whose bones"
3734,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Bind underground our soul’s foundation stones.
3735,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3736,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"O little self, within whose smallness lies"
3737,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"All that man was, and is, and will become,"
3738,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Atom unseen that comprehends the skies
3739,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And tells the tracks by which the planets roam;
3740,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"That, without moving, knows the joys of wings,"
3741,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The tiger’s strength, the eagle’s secrecy,"
3742,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And in the hovel can consort with kings,"
3743,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Or clothe a God with his own mystery.
3744,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"O with what darkness do we cloak thy light,"
3745,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"What dusty folly gather thee for food,"
3746,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Thou who alone art knowledge and delight,"
3747,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The heavenly bread, the beautiful, the good."
3748,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"O living self, O God, O morning star,"
3749,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Give us thy light, forgive us what we are."
3750,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3751,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I went into the fields, but you were there"
3752,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Waiting for me, so all the summer flowers"
3753,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Were only glimpses of your starry powers;
3754,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Beautiful and inspired dust they were.
3755,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3756,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I went down by the waters, and a bird"
3757,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Sang with your voice in all the unknown tones
3758,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Of all that self of you I have not heard,"
3759,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,So that my being felt you to the bones.
3760,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3761,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"I went into the house, and shut the door"
3762,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"To be alone, but you were there with me;"
3763,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"All beauty in a little room may be,"
3764,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Though the roof lean and muddy be the floor.
3765,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3766,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Then in my bed I bound my tired eyes
3767,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,To make a darkness for my weary brain;
3768,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"But like a presence you were there again,"
3769,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Being and real, beautiful and wise,"
3770,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3771,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"So that I could not sleep, and cried aloud,"
3772,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"“You strange grave thing, what is it you would say?”"
3773,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The redness of your dear lips dimmed to grey,"
3774,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The waters ebbed, the moon hid in a cloud."
3775,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3776,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Wherever beauty has been quick in clay
3777,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Some effluence of it lives, a spirit dwells,"
3778,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Beauty that death can never take away
3779,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Mixed with the air that shakes the flower bells;
3780,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"So that by waters where the apples fall,"
3781,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Or in lone glens, or valleys full of flowers,"
3782,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Or in the streets where bloody tidings call,"
3783,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The haunting waits the mood that makes it ours.
3784,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Then at a turn, a word, an act, a thought,"
3785,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Such difference comes; the spirit apprehends
3786,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,That place’s glory; for where beauty fought
3787,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Under the veil the glory never ends;
3788,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"But the still grass, the leaves, the trembling flower"
3789,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Keep, through dead time, that everlasting hour."
3790,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3791,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Not for the anguish suffered is the slur,"
3792,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Not for the woman’s taunts, the mocks of men;"
3793,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"No, but because you never welcomed her,"
3794,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Her of whose beauty I am only the pen.
3795,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3796,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There was a dog, dog-minded, with dog’s eyes,"
3797,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Damned by a dog’s brute-nature to be true.
3798,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Something within her made his spirit wise;
3799,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"He licked her hand, he knew her; not so you."
3800,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3801,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"When all adulterate beauty has gone by,"
3802,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"When all inanimate matter has gone down,"
3803,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"We will arise and walk, that dog and I,"
3804,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The only two who knew her in the town.
3805,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3806,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"We’ll range the pleasant mountain side by side,"
3807,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Seeking the blood-stained flowers where Christs have died.
3808,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3809,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"You will remember me in days to come,"
3810,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"With love, or pride, or pity, or contempt,"
3811,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"So will my friends (not many friends, yet some),"
3812,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,When this my life will be a dream out-dreamt;
3813,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And one, remembering friendship by the fire,"
3814,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And one, remembering love time in the dark,"
3815,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And one, remembering unfulfilled desire,"
3816,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Will sigh, perhaps, yet be beside the mark;"
3817,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,For this my body with its wandering ghost
3818,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Is nothing solely but an empty grange,"
3819,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Dark in a night that owls inhabit most,"
3820,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Yet when the King rides by there comes a change
3821,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The windows gleam, the cresset’s fiery hair"
3822,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Blasts the blown branch and beauty lodges there.
3823,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3824,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"If Beauty be at all, if, beyond sense,"
3825,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There be a wisdom piercing into brains,"
3826,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Why should the glory wait on impotence,"
3827,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Biding its time till blood is in the veins?
3828,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3829,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There is no beauty, but, when thought is quick,"
3830,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Out of the noisy sickroom of ourselves
3831,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Some flattery comes to try to cheat the sick,"
3832,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Some drowsy drug is groped for on the shelves.
3833,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3834,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There is no beauty, for we tread a scene"
3835,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Red to the eye with blood of living things;
3836,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Thought is but joy from murder that has been,"
3837,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Life is but brute at war upon its kings.
3838,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3839,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"There is no beauty, nor could beauty care"
3840,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"For us, this dust, that men make everywhere."
3841,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3842,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"If all be governed by the moving stars,"
3843,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"If passing planets bring events to be,"
3844,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Searing the face of Time with bloody scars,"
3845,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Drawing men’s souls even as the moon the sea,"
3846,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,If as they pass they make a current pass
3847,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Across man’s life and heap it to a tide,"
3848,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"We are but pawns, ignobler than the grass"
3849,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Cropped by the beast and crunched and tossed aside.
3850,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Is all this beauty that doth inhabit heaven
3851,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Train of a planet’s fire? Is all this lust
3852,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,A chymic means by warring stars contriven
3853,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,To bring the violets out of Cæsar’s dust?
3854,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Better be grass, or in some hedge unknown"
3855,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The spilling rose whose beauty is its own.
3856,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3857,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"In emptiest furthest heaven where no stars are,"
3858,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Perhaps some planet of our master sun
3859,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Still rolls an unguessed orbit round its star,"
3860,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Unthought, unseen, unknown of anyone."
3861,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Roving dead space according to its law,"
3862,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Casting our light on burnt-out suns and blind,"
3863,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Singing in the frozen void its word of awe,"
3864,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,One wandering thought in all that idiot mind.
3865,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And, in some span of many a thousand year,"
3866,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Passing through heaven its influence may arouse
3867,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Beauty unguessed in those who habit here,"
3868,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And men may rise with glory on their brows
3869,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And feel new life like fire, and see the old"
3870,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Fall from them dead, the bronze’s broken mould."
3871,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3872,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Death lies in wait for you, you wild thing in the wood,"
3873,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Shy-footed beauty dear, half-seen, half-understood."
3874,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Glimpsed in the beech-wood dim and in the dropping fir,"
3875,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Shy like a fawn and sweet and beauty’s minister.
3876,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Glimpsed as in flying clouds by night the little moon,"
3877,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"A wonder, a delight, a paleness passing soon."
3878,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3879,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Only a moment held, only an hour seen,"
3880,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Only an instant known in all that life has been,"
3881,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"One instant in the sand to drink that gush of grace,"
3882,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The beauty of your way, the marvel of your face."
3883,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3884,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Death lies in wait for you, but few short hours he gives;"
3885,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,I perish even as you by whom all spirit lives.
3886,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Come to me, spirit, come, and fill my hour of breath"
3887,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,With hours of life in life that pay no toll to death.
3888,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3889,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Go, spend your penny, Beauty, when you will,"
3890,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,In the grave’s darkness let the stamp be lost.
3891,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The water still will bubble from the hill,"
3892,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And April quick the meadows with her ghost;
3893,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Over the grass the daffodils will shiver,"
3894,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The primroses with their pale beauty abound,"
3895,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,The blackbird be a lover and make quiver
3896,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,With his glad singing the great soul of the ground;
3897,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"So that if the body rot, it will not matter;"
3898,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Up in the earth the great game will go on,"
3899,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The coming of spring and the running of the water,"
3900,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And the young things glad of the womb’s darkness gone.
3901,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,And the joy we felt will be a part of the glory
3902,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,In the lover’s kiss that makes the old couple’s story.
3903,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,
3904,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Let that which is to come be as it may,"
3905,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Darkness, extinction, justice, life intense,"
3906,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"The flies are happy in the summer day,"
3907,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,Flies will be happy many summers hence.
3908,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Time with his antique breeds that built the Sphinx,"
3909,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Time with her men to come whose wings will tower,"
3910,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Poured and will pour, not as the wise man thinks,"
3911,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"But with blind force, to each his little hour."
3912,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"And when the hour has struck, comes death or change,"
3913,_LOLLINGDON DOWNS_,"Which, whether good or ill we cannot tell,"

3944,_REYNARD THE FOX_,On old Cold Crendon’s windy tops
3945,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Grows wintrily Blown Hilcote Copse,"
3946,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Wind-bitten beech with badger barrows,"
3947,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Where brocks eat wasp-grubs with their marrows,"
3948,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And foxes lie on short-grassed turf,"
3949,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Nose between paws, to hear the surf"
3950,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Of wind in the beeches drowsily.
3951,_REYNARD THE FOX_,There was our fox bred lustily
3952,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Three years before, and there he berthed,"
3953,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Under the beech-roots snugly earthed,"
3954,_REYNARD THE FOX_,With a roof of flint and a floor of chalk
3955,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And ten bitten hens’ heads each on its stalk,"
3956,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Some rabbits’ paws, some fur from scuts,"
3957,_REYNARD THE FOX_,A badger’s corpse and a smell of guts.
3958,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And there on the night before my tale
3959,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He trotted out for a point in the vale.
3960,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
3961,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
3962,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
3963,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He saw, from the cover edge, the valley"
3964,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Go trooping down with its droops of sally
3965,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"To the brimming river’s lipping bend,"
3966,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And a light in the inn at Water’s End.
3967,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He heard the owl go hunting by
3968,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And the shriek of the mouse the owl made die,"
3969,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the purr of the owl as he tore the red
3970,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Strings from between his claws and fed;
3971,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The smack of joy of the horny lips
3972,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Marbled green with the blobby strips.
3973,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He saw the farms where the dogs were barking,"
3974,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Cold Crendon Court and Copsecote Larking;
3975,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The fault with the spring as bright as gleed,"
3976,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Green-slash-laced with water-weed.
3977,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A glare in the sky still marked the town,"
3978,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Though all folk slept and the blinds were down,"
3979,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The street lamps watched the empty square,"
3980,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The night-cat sang his evil there.
3981,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
3982,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
3983,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
3984,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The fox’s nose tipped up and round,"
3985,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Since smell is a part of sight and sound.
3986,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Delicate smells were drifting by,"
3987,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The sharp nose flaired them heedfully;
3988,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Partridges in the clover stubble,"
3989,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Crouched in a ring for the stoat to nubble.
3990,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Rabbit bucks beginning to box;
3991,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A scratching place for the pheasant cocks,"
3992,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A hare in the dead grass near the drain,"
3993,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And another smell like the spring again.
3994,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
3995,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
3996,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
3997,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A faint rank taint like April coming,"
3998,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"It touched his heart till his blood went drumming,"
3999,_REYNARD THE FOX_,For somewhere out by Ghost Heath Stubs
4000,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Was a roving vixen wanting cubs.
4001,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Over the valley, floating faint"
4002,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"On a warmth of windflaw, came the taint;"
4003,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He cocked his ears, he upped his brush,"
4004,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And he went upwind like an April thrush.
4005,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4006,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4007,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4008,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"By the Roman Road to Braiches Ridge,"
4009,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Where the fallen willow makes a bridge,"
4010,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Over the brook by White Hart’s Thorn
4011,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"To the acres thin with pricking corn,"
4012,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Over the sparse green hair of the wheat,"
4013,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"By the Clench Brook Mill at Clench Brook Leat,"
4014,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Through Cowfoot Pastures to Nonely Stevens,"
4015,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And away to Poltrewood St. Jevons.
4016,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Past Tott Hill Down all snaked with meuses,"
4017,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Past Clench St. Michael and Naunton Crucis,"
4018,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Past Howle’s Oak Farm where the raving brain
4019,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Of a dog who heard him foamed his chain;
4020,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then off, as the farmer’s window opened,"
4021,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Past Stonepits Farm to Upton Hope End,"
4022,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Over short sweet grass and worn flint arrows
4023,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the three dumb hows of Tencombe Barrows.
4024,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And away and away with a rolling scramble,"
4025,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Through the sally and up the bramble,"
4026,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"With a nose for the smells the night wind carried,"
4027,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And his red fell clean for being married;
4028,_REYNARD THE FOX_,For clicketting time and Ghost Heath Wood
4029,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Had put the violet in his blood.
4030,_REYNARD THE FOX_,

4032,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4033,_REYNARD THE FOX_,At Tencombe Rings near the Manor Linney
4034,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"His foot made the great black stallion whinny,"
4035,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the stallion’s whinny aroused the stable
4036,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And the bloodhound bitches stretched their cable,"
4037,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the clink of the bloodhounds’ chain aroused
4038,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The sweet-breathed kye as they chewed and drowsed,"
4039,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the stir of the cattle changed the dream
4040,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Of the cat in the loft to tense green gleam.
4041,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The red-wattled black cock hot from Spain
4042,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Crowed from his perch for dawn again,"
4043,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"His breast-pufft hens, one-legged on perch,"
4044,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Gurgled, beak-down, like men in church,"
4045,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"They crooned in the dark, lifting one red eye"
4046,_REYNARD THE FOX_,In the raftered roost as the fox went by.
4047,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4048,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4049,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4050,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"By Tencombe Regis and Slaughters Court,"
4051,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Through the great grass square of Roman Fort,"
4052,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"By Nun’s Wood Yews and the Hungry Hill,"
4053,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the Corpse Way Stones all standing still.
4054,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"By Seven Springs Mead to Deerlip Brook,"
4055,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And a lolloping leap to Water Hook.
4056,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then with eyes like sparks and his blood awoken,"
4057,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Over the grass to Water’s Oaken,"
4058,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And over the hedge and into ride
4059,_REYNARD THE FOX_,In Ghost Heath Wood for his roving bride.
4060,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4061,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4062,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4063,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Before the dawn he had loved and fed
4064,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And found a kennel, and gone to bed"
4065,_REYNARD THE FOX_,On a shelf of grass in a thick of gorse
4066,_REYNARD THE FOX_,That would bleed a hound and blind a horse.
4067,_REYNARD THE FOX_,There he slept in the mild west weather
4068,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"With his nose and brush well tuckt together,"
4069,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He slept like a child, who sleeps yet hears"
4070,_REYNARD THE FOX_,With the self who needs neither eyes nor ears.
4071,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4072,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4073,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4074,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He slept while the pheasant cock untucked
4075,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"His head from his wing, flew down and kukked,"
4076,_REYNARD THE FOX_,While the drove of the starlings whirred and wheeled
4077,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Out of the ash-trees into field,"
4078,_REYNARD THE FOX_,While with great black flags that flogged and paddled
4079,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The rooks went out to the plough and straddled,"
4080,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Straddled wide on the moist red cheese
4081,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Of the furrows driven at Uppat’s Leas.
4082,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4083,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4084,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4085,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Down in the village men awoke,"
4086,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The chimneys breathed with a faint blue smoke.
4087,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The fox slept on, though tweaks and twitches,"
4088,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Due to his dreams, ran down his flitches."
4089,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4090,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4091,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4092,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The cows were milked and the yards were sluict,"
4093,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And cocks and hens let out of roost,"
4094,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Windows were opened, mats were beaten,"
4095,_REYNARD THE FOX_,All men’s breakfasts were cooked and eaten;
4096,_REYNARD THE FOX_,But out in the gorse on the grassy shelf
4097,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The sleeping fox looked after himself.
4098,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4099,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4100,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4101,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Deep in his dream he heard the life
4102,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Of the woodland seek for food or wife,"
4103,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The hop of a stoat, a buck that thumped,"
4104,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The squeal of a rat as a weasel jumped,"
4105,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The blackbird’s chackering scattering crying,"
4106,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The rustling bents from the rabbits flying,"
4107,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Cows in a byre, and distant men,"
4108,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And Condicote church-clock striking ten.
4109,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4110,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4111,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4112,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"At eleven o’clock a boy went past,"
4113,_REYNARD THE FOX_,With a rough-haired terrier following fast.
4114,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The boy’s sweet whistle and dog’s quick yap
4115,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Woke the fox from out of his nap.
4116,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4117,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4118,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4119,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He rose and stretched till the claws in his pads
4120,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Stuck hornily out like long black gads.
4121,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He listened a while, and his nose went round"
4122,_REYNARD THE FOX_,To catch the smell of the distant sound.
4123,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4124,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4125,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4126,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The windward smells came free from taint--
4127,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"They were rabbit, strongly, with lime-kiln, faint,"
4128,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A wild-duck, likely, at Sars Holt Pond,"
4129,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And sheep on the Sars Holt Down beyond.
4130,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4131,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4132,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4133,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The leeward smells were much less certain,"
4134,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"For the Ghost Heath Hill was like a curtain,"
4135,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Yet vague, from the leeward, now and then,"
4136,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Came muffled sounds like the sound of men.
4137,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4138,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4139,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4140,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He moved to his right to a clearer space,"
4141,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And all his soul came into his face,"
4142,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Into his eyes and into his nose,"
4143,_REYNARD THE FOX_,As over the hill a murmur rose.
4144,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"His ears were cocked and his keen nose flaired,"
4145,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He sneered with his lips till his teeth were bared,"
4146,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He trotted right and lifted a pad
4147,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Trying to test what foes he had.
4148,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4149,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4150,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4151,_REYNARD THE FOX_,On Ghost Heath turf was a steady drumming
4152,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Which sounded like horses quickly coming,"
4153,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"It died as the hunt went down the dip,"
4154,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Then Malapert yelped at Myngs’s whip.
4155,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A bright iron horseshoe clinkt on stone,"
4156,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then a man’s voice spoke, not one alone,"
4157,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then a burst of laughter, swiftly still,"
4158,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Muffled away by Ghost Heath Hill.
4159,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then, indistinctly, the clop, clip, clep,"
4160,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"On Brady Ride, of a horse’s step."
4161,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then silence, then, in a burst, much clearer,"
4162,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Voices and horses coming nearer,"
4163,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And another noise, of a pit-pat beat"
4164,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"On the Ghost Hill grass, of foxhound feet."
4165,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4166,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4167,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4168,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He sat on his haunches listening hard,"
4169,_REYNARD THE FOX_,While his mind went over the compass card.
4170,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Men were coming and rest was done,"
4171,_REYNARD THE FOX_,But he still had time to get fit to run;
4172,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He could outlast horse and outrace hound,"
4173,_REYNARD THE FOX_,But men were devils from Lobs’s Pound.
4174,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Scent was burning, the going good,"
4175,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The world one lust for a fox’s blood,"
4176,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The main earths stopped and the drains put to,"
4177,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And fifteen miles to the land he knew.
4178,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"But of all the ills, the ill least pleasant"
4179,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Was to run in the light when men were present
4180,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Men in the fields to shout and sign
4181,_REYNARD THE FOX_,For a lift of hounds to a fox’s line.
4182,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Men at the earth, at the long point’s end,"
4183,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Men at each check and none his friend,"
4184,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Guessing each shift that a fox contrives;
4185,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"But still, needs must when the devil drives."
4186,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4187,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4188,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4189,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He readied himself, then a soft horn blew,"
4190,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then a clear voice carolled, “Ed-hoick! Eleu!”"
4191,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Then the wood-end rang with the clear voice crying
4192,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And the crackle of scrub where hounds were trying.
4193,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then the horn blew nearer, a hound’s voice quivered,"
4194,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then another, then more, till his body shivered,"
4195,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He left his kennel and trotted thence
4196,_REYNARD THE FOX_,With his ears flexed back and his nerves all tense.
4197,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4198,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He trotted down with his nose intent
4199,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"For a fox’s line to cross his scent,"
4200,_REYNARD THE FOX_,It was only fair (he being a stranger)
4201,_REYNARD THE FOX_,That the native fox should have the danger.
4202,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Danger was coming, so swift, so swift,"
4203,_REYNARD THE FOX_,That the pace of his trot began to lift
4204,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The blue-winged Judas, a jay began"
4205,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Swearing, hounds whimpered, air stank of man."
4206,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4207,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4208,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4209,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He hurried his trotting, he now felt frighted,"
4210,_REYNARD THE FOX_,It was his poor body made hounds excited.
4211,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He felt as he ringed the great wood through,"
4212,_REYNARD THE FOX_,That he ought to make for the land he knew.
4213,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4214,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4215,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4216,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then the hounds’ excitement quivered and quickened,"
4217,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then a horn blew death till his marrow sickened,"
4218,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Then the wood behind was a crash of cry
4219,_REYNARD THE FOX_,For the blood in his veins; it made him fly.
4220,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4221,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4222,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4223,_REYNARD THE FOX_,They were on his line; it was death to stay.
4224,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He must make for home by the shortest way,"
4225,_REYNARD THE FOX_,But with all this yelling and all this wrath
4226,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"And all these devils, how find a path?"
4227,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4228,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4229,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4230,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"He ran like a stag to the wood’s north corner,"
4231,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Where the hedge was thick and the ditch a yawner,"
4232,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"But the scarlet glimpse of Myngs on Turk,"
4233,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Watching the woodside, made him shirk."
4234,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4235,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4236,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4237,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He ringed the wood and looked at the south.
4238,_REYNARD THE FOX_,What wind there was blew into his mouth.
4239,_REYNARD THE FOX_,But close to the woodland’s blackthorn thicket
4240,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Was Dansey, still as a stone, on picket."
4241,_REYNARD THE FOX_,At Dansey’s back were a twenty more
4242,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Watching the cover and pressing fore.
4243,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4244,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4245,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4246,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The fox drew in and flaired with his muzzle.
4247,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Death was there if he messed the puzzle.
4248,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"There were men without and hounds within,"
4249,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A crying that stiffened the hair on skin,"
4250,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Teeth in cover and death without,"
4251,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Both deaths coming, and no way out."
4252,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4253,_REYNARD THE FOX_,*       *       *       *       *
4254,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4255,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"His nose ranged swiftly, his heart beat fast,"
4256,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then a crashing cry rose up in a blast,"
4257,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then horse-hooves trampled, then horses’ flitches"

4273,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He hugged the ditch as his only friend.
4274,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The blackbird cock with the golden beak
4275,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Got out of his way with a jabbering shriek,"

4290,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Then all hounds crying with all their forces,"
4291,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Then a thundering down of seventy horses.
4292,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Robin Dawe’s horn and halloos of “Hey
4293,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Hark Hollar, Hoik!” and “Gone away!”"
4294,_REYNARD THE FOX_,“Hark Hollar Hoik!” and a smack of the whip.
4295,_REYNARD THE FOX_,A yelp as a tail hound caught the clip.
4296,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"“Hark Hollar, Hark Hollar!” then Robin made"

4298,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Hounds were over and on his line
4299,_REYNARD THE FOX_,With a head like bees upon Tipple Tine.
4300,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The sound of the nearness sent a flood
4301,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Of terror of death through the fox’s blood.

4311,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Came from Sir Peter on his white.
4312,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The hounds went romping with delight
4313,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Over the grass and got together,"
4314,_REYNARD THE FOX_,The tail hounds galloped hell-for-leather
4315,_REYNARD THE FOX_,After the pack at Myngs’s yell.
4316,_REYNARD THE FOX_,A cry like every kind of bell

4325,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The scent was heavy on their sense,"
4326,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"So hot, it seemed the living thing,"

4328,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Gusts of it made their hackles rise,"
4329,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Hot gulps of it were agonies
4330,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Of joy, and thirst for blood and passion."
4331,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"“Forrard!” cried Robin, “that’s the fashion.”"
4332,_REYNARD THE FOX_,He raced beside his pack to cheer.
4333,_REYNARD THE FOX_,
4334,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"The field’s noise died upon his ear,"
4335,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"A faint horn, far behind, blew thin"
4336,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"In cover, lest some hound were in."
4337,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Then instantly the great grass rise
4338,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"Shut field and cover from his eyes,"

4340,_REYNARD THE FOX_,“A dead fox or a broken bone.”

4358,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Then dived into the bullfinch heart
4359,_REYNARD THE FOX_,Through thorns that ripped his sleeves apart
4360,_REYNARD THE FOX_,And skutched new blood upon his brow.
4361,_REYNARD THE FOX_,"“His point’s Lark’s Leybourne Covers now,”"

4402,_REYNARD THE FOX_,A wild last hound with high shrill yelps

4445,_ENSLAVED_,I went into the garden most glad to be alive;
4446,_ENSLAVED_,"The thrushes and the blackbirds were singing in the thorn,"
4447,_ENSLAVED_,The April flowers were singing for joy of being born.
4448,_ENSLAVED_,
4449,_ENSLAVED_,I smelt the dewy morning come blowing through the woods
4450,_ENSLAVED_,Where all the wilding cherries do toss their snowy snoods;
4451,_ENSLAVED_,I thought of the running water where sweet white violets grow.
4452,_ENSLAVED_,I said: “I’ll pick them for her; because she loves them so.”
4453,_ENSLAVED_,
4454,_ENSLAVED_,"So in the dewy morning I turned to climb the hill,"
4455,_ENSLAVED_,Beside the running water whose tongue is never still.

4459,_ENSLAVED_,"Out of the wood I wandered, but paused upon the heath"
4460,_ENSLAVED_,"To watch, beyond the tree-tops, the wrinkled sea beneath;"
4461,_ENSLAVED_,Its blueness and its stillness were trembling as it lay
4462,_ENSLAVED_,In the old un-autumned beauty that never goes away.
4463,_ENSLAVED_,
4464,_ENSLAVED_,"And the beauty of the water brought my love into my mind,"
4465,_ENSLAVED_,"Because all sweet love is beauty, and the loved thing turns to kind;"
4466,_ENSLAVED_,"And I thought, “It is a beauty spread for setting of your grace,"
4467,_ENSLAVED_,O white violet of a woman with the April in your face.”
4468,_ENSLAVED_,
4469,_ENSLAVED_,"So I gathered the white violets where young men pick them still,"

4730,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"When the shepherds feel the cold,"
4731,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A horse’s hoofs went clip-a-clock
4732,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Along the hangman’s wold.

4734,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The horse-hoofs trotted on the stone,"
4735,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hoof-sparks glittered by,"
4736,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And then a hunting horn was blown
4737,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And hounds broke into cry.
4738,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4739,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"There was a strangeness in the horn,"

4743,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4744,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A power of night that ran a prey
4745,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Along the hangman’s hill.
4746,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The shepherds heard the spent buck bray
4747,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the horn blow for the kill.
4748,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4749,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They heard the worrying of the hounds

4754,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“What hounds are these that hunt the night?”

4762,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And all their lips went back.
4763,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4764,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Lord God!” the shepherds said, “they come;"
4765,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And see what hounds he has:

4783,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4784,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They came to where the hounds had fed,"
4785,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And in that trampled place
4786,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They found a pedlar lying dead,"

4794,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Out grazing on the whin.
4795,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4796,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The next night, as he lay in bed,"
4797,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He heard a canterer come
4798,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Trampling the wold-top with a tread
4799,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That sounded like a drum.
4800,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4801,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He thought it was a post that rode,"
4802,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,So turned him to his sleep;
4803,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,But the canterer in his dream abode
4804,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Like horse-hoofs running sheep.
4805,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4806,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And in his dreams a horn was blown
4807,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And feathering hounds replied,"
4808,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And all his wethers stood like stone
4809,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,In rank on the hillside.
4810,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4811,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then, while he struggled still with dreams,"
4812,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He saw his wethers run
4813,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Before a pack cheered on with screams,"
4814,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The thousand sheep as one.
4815,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4816,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"So, leaping from his bed in fear,"
4817,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He flung the window back,"
4818,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And he heard a death-horn blowing clear
4819,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the crying of a pack,"
4820,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the thundering of a thousand sheep,"
4821,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,All mad and running wild
4822,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"To the stone-pit seven fathoms deep,"
4823,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Whence all the town is tiled.
4824,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4825,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"After them came the hounds of hell,"
4826,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,With hell’s own fury filled;
4827,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Into the pit the wethers fell,"
4828,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And all but three were killed.
4829,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4830,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The hunter blew his horn a note
4831,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And laughed against the moon;
4832,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The farmer’s breath caught in his throat,"
4833,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He fell into a swoon.

4837,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The next night when the watch was set
4838,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A heavy rain came down,"
4839,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The leaden gutters dripped with wet
4840,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Into the shuttered town.
4841,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4842,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"So close the shutters were, the chink"
4843,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Of lamplight scarcely showed;
4844,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The men at fireside heard no clink
4845,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Of horse-hoofs on the road.
4846,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4847,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They heard the creaking hinge complain,"
4848,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the mouse that gnawed the floor,"
4849,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the limping footsteps of the rain
4850,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,On the stone outside the door.
4851,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4852,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And on the wold the rain came down
4853,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Till trickles streakt the grass:
4854,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A traveller riding to the town
4855,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Drew rein to let it pass.
4856,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4857,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The wind sighed in the fir-tree tops,"
4858,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The trickles sobb’d in the grass,"
4859,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The branches ran with showers of drops:
4860,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,No other noise there was.
4861,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4862,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Till up the wold the traveller heard
4863,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A horn blow faint and thin;
4864,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He thought it was the curlew bird
4865,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Lamenting to the whin;
4866,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4867,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And when the far horn blew again,"
4868,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He thought an owl hallooed,"
4869,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Or a rabbit gave a shriek of pain
4870,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,As the stoat leapt in the wood.
4871,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4872,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"But when the horn blew next, it blew"
4873,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A trump that split the air,"
4874,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And hounds gave cry to an Halloo!
4875,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The hunt of hell was there.
4876,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4877,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Black” (said the traveller), “black and swift,"
4878,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Those running devils came;
4879,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Scoring to cry with hackles stifft,"
4880,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And grin-jowls dropping flame.”
4881,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4882,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They settled to the sightless scent,"
4883,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And up the hill a cry
4884,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Told where the frightened quarry went,"
4885,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Well knowing it would die.
4886,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4887,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then presently a cry rang out,"
4888,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And a mort blew for the kill;
4889,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A shepherd with his throat torn out
4890,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Lay dead upon the hill.

4896,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"No man, for money or for love,"
4897,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Would watch them on the down.
4898,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4899,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"But night by night the terror ran,"
4900,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The townsmen heard them still;
4901,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Nightly the hell-hounds hunted man
4902,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the hunter whooped the kill.
4903,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4904,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The men who lived upon the moor
4905,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Would waken to the scratch
4906,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Of hounds’ claws digging at the door
4907,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Or scraping at the latch.
4908,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4909,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And presently no man would go
4910,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Without doors after dark,"
4911,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Lest hell’s black hunting horn should blow,"
4912,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And hell’s black bloodhounds mark.

4914,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They shivered round the fire at home,"
4915,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,While out upon the bent
4916,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The hounds with black jowls dropping foam
4917,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Went nosing to the scent.
4918,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4919,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Men let the hay crop run to seed
4920,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the corn crop sprout in ear,"
4921,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the root crop choke itself in weed,"
4922,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That hell-hound hunting year.
4923,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4924,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Empty to heaven lay the wold,"
4925,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Village and church grew green;
4926,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The courtyard flagstones spread with mould,"

4929,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And sometimes when the cock had crowed,"
4930,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the hillside stood out grey,"

4951,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"St. Withiel lived upon the moor,"
4952,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Where the peat-men live in holes;
4953,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He worked among the peat-men poor,"
4954,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Who only have their souls.
4955,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4956,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He brought them nothing but his love
4957,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the will to do them good,"
4958,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"But power filled him from above,"
4959,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,His very touch was food.
4960,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4961,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Men told St. Withiel of the hounds,"
4962,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And how they killed their prey.
4963,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He thought them far beyond his bounds,"
4964,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,So many miles away.
4965,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4966,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Then one whose son the hounds had killed
4967,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Told him the tale at length;
4968,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,St. Withiel pondered why God willed
4969,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That hell should have such strength.
4970,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4971,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then one, a passing traveller, told"
4972,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"How, since the hounds had come,"
4973,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The church was empty on the wold,"
4974,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And all the priests were dumb.
4975,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4976,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"St. Withiel rose at this, and said:"
4977,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“This priest will not be dumb;
4978,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,My spirit will not be afraid
4979,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Though all hell’s devils come.”
4980,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4981,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He took his stick and out he went,"
4982,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The long way to the wold,"
4983,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Where the sheep-bells clink upon the bent
4984,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And every wind is cold.
4985,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4986,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He passed the rivers running red
4987,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the mountains standing bare;
4988,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"At last the wold-land lay ahead,"
4989,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Un-yellowed by the share.
4990,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4991,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,All in the brown October time
4992,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He clambered to the weald;
4993,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The plum lay purpled into slime,"
4994,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The harvest lay in field.
4995,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
4996,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Trampled by many-footed rain
4997,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The sunburnt corn lay dead;
4998,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The myriad finches in the grain
4999,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Rose bothering at his tread.
5000,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5001,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The myriad finches took a sheer
5002,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And settled back to food:
5003,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A man was not a thing to fear
5004,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,In such a solitude.
5005,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5006,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hurrying of their wings died out,"
5007,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A silence took the hill;
5008,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"There was no dog, no bell, no shout,"
5009,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The windmill’s sails were still.
5010,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5011,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The gate swung creaking on its hasp,"
5012,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The pear splashed from the tree,"
5013,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,In the rotting apple’s heart the wasp
5014,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Was drunken drowsily.
5015,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5016,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The grass upon the cart-wheel ruts
5017,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Had made the trackways dim;
5018,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The rabbits ate and hopped their scuts,"
5019,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They had no fear of him.
5020,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5021,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The sunset reddened in the west;
5022,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The distant depth of blue
5023,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Stretched out and dimmed; to twiggy nest
5024,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The rooks in clamour drew.
5025,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5026,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The oakwood in his mail of brass
5027,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Bowed his great crest and stood;
5028,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The pine-tree saw St. Withiel pass,"
5029,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,His great bole blushed like blood.
5030,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5031,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then tree and wood alike were dim,"
5032,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Yet still St. Withiel strode;
5033,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The only noise to comfort him
5034,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Were his footsteps on the road.
5035,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5036,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The crimson in the west was smoked,"
5037,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The west wind heaped the wrack,"
5038,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Each tree seemed like a murderer cloaked
5039,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,To stab him in the back.
5040,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5041,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Darkness and desolation came
5042,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,To dog his footsteps there;
5043,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The dead leaves rustling called his name,"
5044,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The death-moth brushed his hair.
5045,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5046,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The murmurings of the wind fell still;
5047,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He stood and stared around:
5048,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He was alone upon the hill,"
5049,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,On devil-haunted ground.
5050,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5051,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,What was the whitish thing which stood
5052,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"In front, with one arm raised,"
5053,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Like death a-grinning in a hood?
5054,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint stood still and gazed.
5055,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5056,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“What are you?” said St. Withiel. “Speak!”
5057,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Not any answer came
5058,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"But the night-wind making darkness bleak,"
5059,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the leaves that called his name.
5060,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5061,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A glow shone on the whitish thing,"
5062,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,It neither stirred nor spoke:
5063,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"In spite of faith, a shuddering"
5064,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Made the good saint to choke.
5065,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5066,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He struck the whiteness with his staff--
5067,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,It was a withered tree;
5068,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"An owl flew from it with a laugh,"
5069,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The darkness shook with glee.
5070,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5071,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The darkness came all round him close
5072,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And cackled in his ear;
5073,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The midnight, full of life none knows,"
5074,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Was very full of fear.
5075,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5076,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The darkness cackled in his heart
5077,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"That things of hell were there,"
5078,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That the startled rabbit played a part
5079,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the stoat’s leap did prepare--
5080,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5081,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Prepare the stage of night for blood,"
5082,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And the mind of night for death,"
5083,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,For a spirit trembling in the mud
5084,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,In an agony for breath.
5085,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5086,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A terror came upon the saint,"
5087,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,It stripped his spirit bare;
5088,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He was sick body standing faint,"
5089,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Cold sweat and stiffened hair.
5090,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5091,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He took his terror by the throat
5092,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And stamped it underfoot;
5093,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then, far away, the death-horn’s note"
5094,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Quailed like a screech-owl’s hoot.
5095,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5096,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Still far away that devil’s horn
5097,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Its quavering death-note blew,"
5098,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,But the saint could hear the crackling thorn
5099,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That the hounds trod as they drew.
5100,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5101,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Lord, it is true,” St. Withiel moaned,"
5102,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“And the hunt is drawing near!
5103,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Devils that Paradise disowned,"
5104,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They know that I am here.
5105,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5106,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“And there, O God, a hound gives tongue,"
5107,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And great hounds quarter dim”--
5108,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The saint’s hands to his body clung,"
5109,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He knew they came for him.
5110,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5111,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then close at hand the horn was loud,"
5112,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Like Peter’s cock of old
5113,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"For joy that Peter’s soul was cowed,"
5114,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And Jesus’ body sold.
5115,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5116,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Then terribly the hounds in cry
5117,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Gave answer to the horn;
5118,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint in terror turned to fly
5119,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Before his flesh was torn.
5120,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5121,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"After his body came the hounds,"
5122,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,After the hounds the horse;
5123,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Their running crackled with the sounds
5124,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Of fire that runs in gorse.
5125,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5126,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The saint’s breath failed, but still they came:"
5127,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hunter cheered them on,"
5128,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Even as a wind that blows a flame
5129,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,In the vigil of St. John.
5130,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5131,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And as St. Withiel’s terror grew,"
5132,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The crying of the pack
5133,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Bayed nearer, as though terror drew"
5134,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Those grip teeth to his back.
5135,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5136,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"No hope was in his soul, no stay,"
5137,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Nothing but screaming will
5138,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,To save his terror-stricken clay
5139,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Before the hounds could kill.
5140,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5141,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The laid corn tripped, the bramble caught,"
5142,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He stumbled on the stones;
5143,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The thorn that scratched him, to his thought,"
5144,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Was hell’s teeth at his bones.
5145,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5146,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"His legs seemed bound as in a dream,"
5147,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The wet earth held his feet,"
5148,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He screamed aloud as rabbits scream
5149,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Before the stoat’s teeth meet.
5150,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5151,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A black thing struck him on the brow,"
5152,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A blackness loomed and waved;
5153,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,It was a tree--he caught a bough
5154,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And scrambled up it, saved."
5155,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5156,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Saved for the moment, as he thought,"
5157,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He pressed against the bark:
5158,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hell-hounds missed the thing they sought,"
5159,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They quartered in the dark.
5160,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5161,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They panted underneath the tree,"
5162,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They quartered to the call;
5163,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hunter cried: “Yoi doit, go see!”"
5164,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,His death-horn blew a fall.
5165,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5166,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Now up, now down, the hell-hounds went"
5167,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,With soft feet padding wide;
5168,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They tried, but could not hit the scent,"
5169,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,However hard they tried.
5170,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5171,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then presently the horn was blown,"
5172,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The hounds were called away;
5173,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The hoof-beats glittered on the stone
5174,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And trotted on the brae.
5175,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5176,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,*       *       *       *       *
5177,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5178,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The saint gat strength, but with it came"
5179,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A horror of his fear,"
5180,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Anguish at having failed, and shame,"
5181,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And sense of judgment near:
5182,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5183,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Anguish at having left his charge
5184,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And having failed his trust,"
5185,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,At having flung his sword and targe
5186,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,To save his body’s dust.
5187,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5188,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He clambered down the saving tree.
5189,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“I am unclean!” he cried.
5190,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Christ died upon a tree for me,"
5191,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,I used a tree to hide.
5192,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5193,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“The hell-hounds bayed about the cross,"
5194,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And tore his clothes apart;
5195,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"But Christ was gold, and I am dross,"
5196,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And mud is in my heart.”
5197,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5198,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He stood in anguish in the field;
5199,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A little wind blew by,"
5200,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The dead leaves dropped, the great stars wheeled"
5201,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Their squadrons in the sky.
5202,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5203,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,*       *       *       *       *
5204,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5205,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Lord, I will try again,” he said,"
5206,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“Though all hell’s devils tear.
5207,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"This time I will not be afraid,"
5208,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And what is sent I’ll dare.”
5209,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5210,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He set his face against the slope
5211,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Until he topped the brae;
5212,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Courage had healed his fear, and hope"
5213,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Had put his shame away.
5214,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5215,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And then, far-off, a quest-note ran,"
5216,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A feathering hound replied:
5217,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The hounds still drew the night for man
5218,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Along that countryside.
5219,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5220,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then one by one the hell-hounds spoke,"
5221,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And still the horn made cheer;
5222,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Then the full devil-chorus woke
5223,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,To fill the saint with fear.
5224,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5225,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He knew that they were after him
5226,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,To hunt him till he fell;
5227,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He turned and fled into the dim,"
5228,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And after him came hell.
5229,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5230,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Over the stony wold he went,"
5231,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Through thorns and over quags;
5232,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The bloodhounds cried upon the scent,"
5233,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They ran like rutting stags.
5234,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5235,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And when the saint looked round, he saw"
5236,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Red eyes intently strained,"
5237,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The bright teeth in the grinning jaw,"
5238,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And running shapes that gained.
5239,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5240,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Uphill, downhill, with failing breath,"
5241,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He ran to save his skin,"
5242,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Like one who knocked the door of death,"
5243,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Yet dared not enter in.
5244,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5245,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then water gurgled in the night,"
5246,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Dark water lay in front,"
5247,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint saw bubbles running bright;
5248,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The huntsman cheered his hunt.
5249,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5250,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint leaped far into the stream
5251,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And struggled to the shore.
5252,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hunt died like an evil dream,"
5253,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A strange land lay before.
5254,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5255,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He waded to a glittering land,"
5256,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,With brighter light than ours;
5257,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The water ran on silver sand
5258,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,By yellow water-flowers.
5259,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5260,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The fishes nosed the stream to rings
5261,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"As petals floated by,"
5262,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The apples were like orbs of kings
5263,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Against a glow of sky.
5264,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5265,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,On cool and steady stalks of green
5266,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The outland flowers grew.
5267,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The ghost-flower, silver like a queen,"
5268,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The queen-flower streakt with blue.
5269,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5270,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The king-flower, crimson on his stalk,"
5271,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,With frettings in his crown;
5272,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The peace-flower, purple, from the chalk,"
5273,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The flower that loves the down.
5274,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5275,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Lilies like thoughts, roses like words,"
5276,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,In the sweet brain of June;
5277,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The bees there, like the stock-dove birds,"
5278,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Breathed all the air with croon.
5279,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5280,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Purple and golden hung the plums;
5281,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Like slaves bowed down with gems
5282,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The peach-trees were; sweet-scented gums
5283,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Oozed clammy from their stems.
5284,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5285,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And birds of every land were there,"
5286,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Like flowers that sang and flew;
5287,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,All beauty that makes singing fair
5288,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That sunny garden knew.
5289,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5290,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,For all together sang with throats
5291,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"So tuned, that the intense"
5292,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Colour and odour pearled the notes
5293,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And passed into the sense.
5294,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5295,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And as the saint drew near, he heard"
5296,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The birds talk, each to each,"
5297,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The fire-bird to the glory-bird.
5298,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He understood their speech.
5299,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5300,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,One said: “The saint was terrified
5301,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Because the hunters came.”
5302,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Another said: “The bloodhounds cried,"
5303,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And all their eyes were flame.”
5304,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5305,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Another said: “No shame to him,"
5306,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,For mortal men are blind:
5307,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They cannot see beyond the grim
5308,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Into the peace behind.”
5309,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5310,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Another sang: “They cannot know,"
5311,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Unless we give the clue,"
5312,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The power that waits in them below
5313,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The things they are and do.”
5314,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5315,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Another sang: “They never guess
5316,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That deep within them stand
5317,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Courage and peace and loveliness,"
5318,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Wisdom and skill of hand.”
5319,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5320,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Another sang: “Sing, brothers! come,"
5321,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Make beauty in the air!
5322,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint is shamed with martyrdom
5323,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Beyond his strength to bear.
5324,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5325,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Sing, brothers! every bird that flies!”"
5326,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"They stretcht their throats to sing,"
5327,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,With the sweetness known in Paradise
5328,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,When the bells of heaven ring.
5329,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5330,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Open the doors, good saint!” they cried,"
5331,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Pass deeper to your soul;
5332,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,There is a spirit in your side
5333,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That hell cannot control.
5334,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5335,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Open the doors to let him in,"
5336,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,That beauty with the sword;
5337,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The hounds are silly shapes of sin,"
5338,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They shrivel at a word.
5339,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5340,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Come, saint!” and as they sang, the air"
5341,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Shone with the shapes of flame,"
5342,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Bird after bright bird glittered there,"
5343,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Crying aloud they came.
5344,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5345,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A rush of brightness and delight,"
5346,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"White as the snow in drift,"
5347,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The fire-bird and the glory-bright,"
5348,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Most beautiful, most swift."
5349,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5350,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Sweeping aloft to show the way,"
5351,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And singing as they flew,"
5352,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Many and glittering as the spray
5353,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,When windy seas are blue.
5354,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5355,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"So cheerily they rushed, so strong"
5356,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Their sweep was through the flowers,"
5357,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint was swept into their song
5358,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And gloried in their powers.
5359,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5360,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He sang, and leaped into the stream,"
5361,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And struggled to the shore;
5362,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The garden faded like a dream,"
5363,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A darkness lay before.
5364,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5365,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Darkness with glimmery light forlorn
5366,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"And quavering hounds in quest,"
5367,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A huntsman blowing on a horn,"
5368,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And lost things not at rest.
5369,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5370,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He saw the huntsman’s hood show black
5371,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Against the greying east;
5372,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He heard him hollo to the pack
5373,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And horn them to the feast.
5374,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5375,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,He heard the bloodhounds come to cry
5376,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And settle to the scent;
5377,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The black horse made the hoof-casts fly,"
5378,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The sparks flashed up the bent.
5379,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5380,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The saint stood still until they came
5381,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Baying to ring him round:
5382,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A horse whose flecking foam was flame,"
5383,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And hound on yelling hound.
5384,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5385,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And jaws that dripped with bitter fire
5386,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Snarled at the saint to tear.
5387,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Pilled hell-hounds, balder than the geier,"
5388,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Leaped round him everywhere.
5389,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5390,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,St. Withiel let the hell-hounds rave.
5391,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"He cried: “Now, in this place,"
5392,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Climb down, you huntsman of the grave,"
5393,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And let me see your face.
5394,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5395,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Climb down, you huntsman out of hell,"
5396,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And show me what you are.
5397,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The judge has stricken on the bell,"
5398,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Now answer at the bar.”
5399,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5400,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The baying of the hounds fell still,"
5401,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Their jaws’ salt fire died.
5402,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The wind of morning struck in chill
5403,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Along that countryside.
5404,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5405,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The blackness of the horse was shrunk,"
5406,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,His sides seemed ribbed and old.
5407,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The rider, hooded like a monk,"
5408,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Was trembling with the cold.
5409,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5410,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The rider bowed as though with pain;
5411,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Then clambered down and stood,"
5412,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The thin thing that the frightened brain
5413,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Had fed with living blood.
5414,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5415,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,“Show me. What are you?” said the saint.
5416,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A hollow murmur spoke.
5417,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“This, Lord,” it said; a hand moved faint"
5418,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And drew aside the cloak.
5419,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5420,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,A Woman Death that palsy shook
5421,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Stood sick and dwindling there;
5422,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Her fingers were a bony crook,"
5423,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And blood was on her hair.
5424,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5425,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Stretch out your hands and sign the Cross,”"
5426,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Was all St. Withiel said.
5427,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The bloodhounds moaned upon the moss,"
5428,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The Woman Death obeyed.
5429,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5430,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Whimpering with pain, she made the sign."
5431,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Go, devil-hag,” said he,"
5432,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Beyond all help of bread and wine,"
5433,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Beyond all land and sea,"
5434,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5435,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"“Into the ice, into the snow,"
5436,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Where Death himself is stark!
5437,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Out, with your hounds about you, go,"
5438,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And perish in the dark!”
5439,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5440,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They dwindled as the mist that fades
5441,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,At coming of the sun;
5442,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Like rags of stuff that fire abrades
5443,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They withered and were done.
5444,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5445,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The cock, that scares the ghost from earth,"
5446,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Crowed as they dwindled down;
5447,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The red sun, happy in his girth,"
5448,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Strode up above the town.
5449,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5450,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Sweetly above the sunny wold
5451,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The bells of churches rang;
5452,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The sheep-bells clinked within the fold,"
5453,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,And the larks went up and sang;
5454,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5455,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Sang for the setting free of men
5456,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,From devils that destroyed;
5457,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The lark, the robin, and the wren,"
5458,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,They joyed and over-joyed.
5459,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5460,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The chats that harbour in the whin,"
5461,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"Their little sweet throats swelled,"
5462,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"The blackbird and the thrush joined in,"
5463,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,The missel-thrush excelled.
5464,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,
5465,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,Till round the saint the singing made
5466,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,"A beauty in the air,"
5467,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,An ecstasy that cannot fade
5468,THE HOUNDS OF HELL,But is for ever there.

5474,ANIMULA,
5475,ANIMULA,
5476,ANIMULA,"This is the place, this house beside the sea;"
5477,ANIMULA,This was the setting where they played their parts.
5478,ANIMULA,"Two men, who knew them all, have talked to me:"
5479,ANIMULA,"Beauty she had, and all had passionate hearts."
5480,ANIMULA,I write this in the window where she sat.
5481,ANIMULA,"Two fields, all green with summer, lie below;"
5482,ANIMULA,"Then the grey sea, at thought, cloud-coloured, flat,"
5483,ANIMULA,"Wind-dappled from the glen, the tide at flow."
5484,ANIMULA,Her portrait and her husband’s hang together
5485,ANIMULA,One on each side the fire; it is close;
5486,ANIMULA,"The tree-tops toss, it is a change of weather."
5487,ANIMULA,"They were most lovely and unhappy, those,"
5488,ANIMULA,That married pair and he who loved too well;
5489,ANIMULA,This was the door by which they entered hell.
5490,ANIMULA,
5491,ANIMULA,"This is a drawing of her as a child,"
5492,ANIMULA,"This is she wed; the faces are the same,"
5493,ANIMULA,"Only the beauty of the babe is wild,"
5494,ANIMULA,The woman’s beauty has been broken tame.
5495,ANIMULA,"Witty, bright, gentle, earnest, with great eyes,"
5496,ANIMULA,"Dark hair in heaps, pure colour, lips that smile;"
5497,ANIMULA,Beauty that is more wisdom than the wise
5498,ANIMULA,Lived in this woman for a little while.
5499,ANIMULA,Dressed in that beauty that our mothers wore
5500,ANIMULA,"(So touching now), she looks out of the frame"
5501,ANIMULA,"With stag-like eyes, that wept till they were sore"
5502,ANIMULA,"Many’s the time, till she was broken tame."
5503,ANIMULA,"Witty, bright, gentle, earnest, even so,"
5504,ANIMULA,Destiny calls and spirits come and go.
5505,ANIMULA,
5506,ANIMULA,This is her husband in his youth; and this
5507,ANIMULA,Is he in manhood; this is he in age.
5508,ANIMULA,"There is a devil in those eyes of his,"
5509,ANIMULA,"A glittering devil, restless in his cage."
5510,ANIMULA,"A grand man, with a beauty and a pride,"
5511,ANIMULA,"A manner and a power and a fire,"
5512,ANIMULA,"With beaks of vultures eating at his side,"
5513,ANIMULA,The great brain mad with unfulfilled desire.
5514,ANIMULA,"“With grand ideas,” they say; tall, wicked, proud,"
5515,ANIMULA,"Cold, cruel, bitter, clever, dainty, skilled;"
5516,ANIMULA,"Splendid to see, a head above the crowd;"
5517,ANIMULA,"Splendid with every strength, yet unfulfilled."
5518,ANIMULA,Cutting himself (and all those near) with hate
5519,ANIMULA,From that sharp mind which should have shaped a state.
5520,ANIMULA,
5521,ANIMULA,And many years ago I saw the third
5522,ANIMULA,Bowed in old age and mad with misery;
5523,ANIMULA,"Mad with the bright eyes of the eagle-bird,"
5524,ANIMULA,Burning his heart at fires of memory.
5525,ANIMULA,"He stood behind a chair, and bent and muttered;"
5526,ANIMULA,"Grand still, grey, sunburnt, bright with mad eyes brown,"
5527,ANIMULA,"Burning, though dying, like a torch that guttered,"
5528,ANIMULA,That once had lit Queen Helen through the town.
5529,ANIMULA,I only saw him once: I saw him go
5530,ANIMULA,"Leaning uphill his body to the rain,"
5531,ANIMULA,"Too good a man for life to punish so,"
5532,ANIMULA,"Theirs were the pride and passion, his the pain."
5533,ANIMULA,His old coat flapped; the little children turned
5534,ANIMULA,"To see him pass, that passionate age that burned."
5535,ANIMULA,
5536,ANIMULA,"“I knew them well, all three,” the old man said;"
5537,ANIMULA,"“He was an unused force, and she a child."
5538,ANIMULA,"She caught him with her beauty, being a maid."
5539,ANIMULA,The thought that she had trapped him drove him wild.
5540,ANIMULA,"He would not work with others, could not rest,"
5541,ANIMULA,And nothing here could use him or engage him;
5542,ANIMULA,"Yet here he stayed, with devils in his breast,"
5543,ANIMULA,To blast the woman who had dared to cage him.
5544,ANIMULA,"Then, when the scholar came, it made the three:"
5545,ANIMULA,"She turned to him, and he, he turned to her."
5546,ANIMULA,They both were saints: elopement could not be;
5547,ANIMULA,"So here they stayed, and passion plied the spur."
5548,ANIMULA,"Then the men fought, and later she was found"
5549,ANIMULA,"In that green pool beyond the headland, drowned."
5550,ANIMULA,
5551,ANIMULA,“They carried her drowned body up the grass
5552,ANIMULA,Here to the house; they laid it on the bed
5553,ANIMULA,"(This very bed, where I have slept, it was)."
5554,ANIMULA,"The scholar begged to see her, being dead."
5555,ANIMULA,"The husband walked downstairs, to see him there"
5556,ANIMULA,Begging to see her as one asks an alms.
5557,ANIMULA,He spat at him and cut his cheek-bone bare.
5558,ANIMULA,"‘There’s pay,’ he said, ‘my poet, for your psalms.’"
5559,ANIMULA,"And then they fought together at the door,"
5560,ANIMULA,"Biting each other, like two dogs, while she"
5561,ANIMULA,"Lay dead, poor woman, dripping on the floor"
5562,ANIMULA,Out of her hair the death-drops of the sea.
5563,ANIMULA,"Later, they fought whenever they might meet,"
5564,ANIMULA,"In church, or in the fields, or in the street.”"
5565,ANIMULA,
5566,ANIMULA,Up on the hill another aged man
5567,ANIMULA,Remembered them. He said: “They were afraid;
5568,ANIMULA,They feared to end the passions they began.
5569,ANIMULA,"They held the cards, and yet they never played."
5570,ANIMULA,He should have broken from her at all cost;
5571,ANIMULA,She should have loved her lover and gone free.
5572,ANIMULA,"They all held winning cards, and yet they lost;"
5573,ANIMULA,So two were wrecked and one drowned in the sea.
5574,ANIMULA,"Some harshness or some law, or else some fear"
5575,ANIMULA,Stifled their souls; God help us! when we know
5576,ANIMULA,"Certainly, certain things, the way is clear."
5577,ANIMULA,"And yet they paid, and one respects them so."
5578,ANIMULA,"Perhaps they were too fine. I know not, I."
5579,ANIMULA,"Men must have mercy, being ripe to die.”"
5580,ANIMULA,
5581,ANIMULA,So this old house of mourning was the stage
5582,ANIMULA,(This house and those green fields) for all that woe.
5583,ANIMULA,"There are her books, her writing on the page;"
5584,ANIMULA,In those choked beds she made the flowers grow.
5585,ANIMULA,"Most desolate it is, the rain is pouring,"
5586,ANIMULA,"The trees all toss and drip and scatter evil,"
5587,ANIMULA,"The floods are out, the waterfall is roaring,"
5588,ANIMULA,The bar is mad with many a leaping devil.
5589,ANIMULA,"And in this house the wind goes whining wild,"
5590,ANIMULA,"The door blows open, till I think to see"
5591,ANIMULA,"That delicate sweet woman, like a child,"
5592,ANIMULA,Standing with great dark stag’s eyes watching me;
5593,ANIMULA,Watching as though her sorrow might make plain
5594,ANIMULA,(Had I but wit) the meaning of such pain.
5595,ANIMULA,
5596,ANIMULA,I wonder if she sang in this old room.
5597,ANIMULA,"Ah, never! No; they tell me that she stood"
5598,ANIMULA,For hours together staring into gloom
5599,ANIMULA,Out of the prison bars of flesh and blood.
5600,ANIMULA,"So, when the ninth wave drowned her, haply she"
5601,ANIMULA,"Wakened, with merging senses, till she blent"
5602,ANIMULA,"Into the joy and colour of the sea,"
5603,ANIMULA,One with the purpose of the element.
5604,ANIMULA,"And there, perhaps, she cannot feel the woe"
5605,ANIMULA,"Passed in this rotting house, but runs like light"
5606,ANIMULA,"Over the billows where the clippers go,"
5607,ANIMULA,One with the blue sea’s pureness of delight;
5608,ANIMULA,"Laughing, perhaps, at that old woe of hers"
5609,ANIMULA,Chained in the cage with fellow-prisoners.
5610,ANIMULA,
5611,ANIMULA,He died in that lone cottage near the sea.
5612,ANIMULA,"In the grey morning when the tide was turning,"
5613,ANIMULA,The wards of life slipt back and set him free
5614,ANIMULA,"From cares of meat and dress, from joys and yearning."
5615,ANIMULA,"Then like an old man gathering strength, he strayed"
5616,ANIMULA,"Over the beach, and strength came into him,"
5617,ANIMULA,Beauty that never threatened nor betrayed
5618,ANIMULA,Made bright the eyes that sorrow had made dim;
5619,ANIMULA,So that upon that stretch of barren sand
5620,ANIMULA,He knew his dreams; he saw her beauty run
5621,ANIMULA,"With Sorrowful Beauty, laughing, hand in hand;"
5622,ANIMULA,He heard the trumpets blow in Avalon.
5623,ANIMULA,He saw the golden statue stretching down
5624,ANIMULA,"The wreath, for him, of roses, in a crown."
5625,ANIMULA,
5626,ANIMULA,They say that as her husband lay a-dying
5627,ANIMULA,He clamoured for a chain to beat the hound.
5628,ANIMULA,They say that all the garden rang with crying
5629,ANIMULA,"That came out of the air, out of the ground,"
5630,ANIMULA,"Out of the waste that was his soul, may be,"
5631,ANIMULA,"Out of the running wolf-hound of his soul,"
5632,ANIMULA,That had been kennelled in and now broke free
5633,ANIMULA,"Out to the moors where stags go, past control."
5634,ANIMULA,All through his life his will had kennelled him;
5635,ANIMULA,"Now he was free, and with a hackling fell"
5636,ANIMULA,"He snarled out of the body to the dim,"
5637,ANIMULA,To run the spirits with the hounds of hell;
5638,ANIMULA,"To run forever at the quarry gone,"
5639,ANIMULA,The uncaught thing a little further on.
5640,ANIMULA,
5641,ANIMULA,"So, one by one, Time took them to his keeping,"
5642,ANIMULA,Those broken lanterns that had held his fire;
5643,ANIMULA,"Dust went to dust, and flesh had time for sleeping,"
5644,ANIMULA,And soul the stag escaped the hound desire.
5645,ANIMULA,"And now, perhaps, the memory of their hate"
5646,ANIMULA,"Has passed from them, and they are friends again,"
5647,ANIMULA,Laughing at all the trouble of this state
5648,ANIMULA,Where men and women work each other pain.
5649,ANIMULA,And in the wind that runs along the glen
5650,ANIMULA,"Beating at cottage doors, they may go by,"
5651,ANIMULA,"Exulting now, and helping sorrowing men"
5652,ANIMULA,To do some little good before they die.
5653,ANIMULA,For from these ploughed-up souls the spirit brings
5654,ANIMULA,"Harvest at last, and sweet from bitter things."

5728,ON GROWING OLD,"For to right and to left, now, were crowded men yelling,"
5729,ON GROWING OLD,"And a great cry boomed backward like muffled bells knelling,"
5730,ON GROWING OLD,"And a surge of men running seemed to follow the race,"
5731,ON GROWING OLD,The horses all trembled and quickened their pace.
5732,ON GROWING OLD,
5733,ON GROWING OLD,"As the porpoise, grown weary of his rush through the dim"
5734,ON GROWING OLD,"Of the unlitten silence where the swiftnesses swim,"
5735,ON GROWING OLD,Learns at sudden the tumult of a clipper bound home
5736,ON GROWING OLD,"And exults with this playmate and leaps in her foam,"
5737,ON GROWING OLD,
5738,ON GROWING OLD,"Or as nightingales coming into England in May,"
5739,ON GROWING OLD,"Coming songless at sunset, being worn with the way,"
5740,ON GROWING OLD,"Settle spent in the twilight, drooping head under wing,"
5741,ON GROWING OLD,"Yet are glad when the dark comes, while at moonrise they sing;"
5742,ON GROWING OLD,"Or as fire on a hillside, by happy boys kindled,"
5743,ON GROWING OLD,"That has burnt black a heath-tuft, scorcht a bramble, and dwindled,"
5744,ON GROWING OLD,"Blown by wind yet arises in a wave of flogged flame,"
5745,ON GROWING OLD,So the souls of those horses to the testing time came.
5746,ON GROWING OLD,
5747,ON GROWING OLD,"Now they closed on their leaders, and the running increased,"
5748,ON GROWING OLD,They rushed down the arc curving round to the east;
5749,ON GROWING OLD,"All the air rang with roaring, all the peopled loud stands"
5750,ON GROWING OLD,"Roared aloud from tense faces, shook with hats and waved hands."
5751,ON GROWING OLD,
5752,ON GROWING OLD,"So they cleared the green gorse-bush by bursting it through,"
5753,ON GROWING OLD,"There was no time for thinking, there was scarce time to do."
5754,ON GROWING OLD,Charles gritted his spirit as he charged through the gorse:
5755,ON GROWING OLD,“You must just grin and suffer: sit still on your horse.”
5756,ON GROWING OLD,
5757,ON GROWING OLD,"There in front was a hurdle and the Distance Post white,"
5758,ON GROWING OLD,"And the long, green, broad Straight washed with wind and blown bright;"
5759,ON GROWING OLD,"Now the roaring had screaming, bringing names to their ears:"
5760,ON GROWING OLD,"“Come, Soyland!” “Sir Lopez!” Then cat-calls; then cheers."
5761,ON GROWING OLD,
5762,ON GROWING OLD,“Sir Lopez! Sir Lopez!” then the jigging brass laughter
5763,ON GROWING OLD,From the yellow toss’t swing-boats swooping rafter to rafter.
5764,ON GROWING OLD,"Then the blare of all organs, then the roar of all throats,"
5765,ON GROWING OLD,"And they shot past the side shows, the horses and boats."
5766,ON GROWING OLD,
5767,ON GROWING OLD,Now the Wants of the Watchers whirled into the race
5768,ON GROWING OLD,"Like flames in their fury, like men in the face,"
5769,ON GROWING OLD,"Mad-red from the Wanting that made them alive,"
5770,ON GROWING OLD,They fought with those horses or helped them to strive.
5771,ON GROWING OLD,
5772,ON GROWING OLD,"Like leaves blown on Hudson when maples turn gold,"
5773,ON GROWING OLD,"They whirled in their colour, they clutched to catch hold,"
5774,ON GROWING OLD,"They sang to the riders, they smote at their hearts"
5775,ON GROWING OLD,"Like flakes of live fire, like castings of darts."
5776,ON GROWING OLD,
5777,ON GROWING OLD,"As a snow in Wisconsin when the darkness comes down,"
5778,ON GROWING OLD,"Running white on the prairie, making all the air brown,"
5779,ON GROWING OLD,"Blinding men with the hurry of its millions of feet,"
5780,ON GROWING OLD,"So the Wants pelted on them, so they blinded and beat."
5781,ON GROWING OLD,
5782,ON GROWING OLD,"And like spirits calm shining upon horses of flame,"
5783,ON GROWING OLD,"Came the Friends of those riders to shield them from shame,"
5784,ON GROWING OLD,"White as fire white-burning, rushing each by his friend,"
5785,ON GROWING OLD,Singing songs of the glory of the world without end;
5786,ON GROWING OLD,
5787,ON GROWING OLD,And as men in Wisconsin driving cars in the snow
5788,ON GROWING OLD,"Butt against its impulsion and face to the blow,"
5789,ON GROWING OLD,"Tossing snow from their bonnets as a ship tosses foam,"
5790,ON GROWING OLD,So the Friends tossed the Wantings as they brought their friends home.
5791,ON GROWING OLD,
5792,ON GROWING OLD,"Now they charged the last hurdle that led to the Straight,"
5793,ON GROWING OLD,"Charles longing to ride, though his spirit said “Wait.”"
5794,ON GROWING OLD,"He came to his horses as they came to the leap,"
5795,ON GROWING OLD,"Eight hard-driven horses, eight men breathing deep."
5796,ON GROWING OLD,
5797,ON GROWING OLD,"On the left, as he leaped it, a flashing of brown"
5798,ON GROWING OLD,"Kicking white on the grass, showed that Thankful was down;"
5799,ON GROWING OLD,"Then a glance, right and left, showed that, barring all flukes,"
5800,ON GROWING OLD,"It was Soyland’s, Sir Lopez’, or Peterkinooks’."
5801,ON GROWING OLD,
5802,ON GROWING OLD,"He passed the Red Ember, he came to the flank"
5803,ON GROWING OLD,"Of Peterkinooks, whom he reached and then sank."
5804,ON GROWING OLD,"There were only two others, going level alone,"
5805,ON GROWING OLD,"First the spotted cream jacket, then the blue, white and roan."
5806,ON GROWING OLD,
5807,ON GROWING OLD,"Up the street of green race-course they strained for the prize,"
5808,ON GROWING OLD,While the stands blurred with waving and the air shook with cries:
5809,ON GROWING OLD,"“Now, Sir Lopez!” “Come, Soyland!” “Now, Sir Lopez! Now, now!”"
5810,ON GROWING OLD,"Then Charles judged his second, but he could not tell how."
5811,ON GROWING OLD,
5812,ON GROWING OLD,"But a glory of sureness leaped from horse into man,"
5813,ON GROWING OLD,"And the man said, “Now, beauty,” and the horse said, “I can.”"
5814,ON GROWING OLD,"And the long weary Royal made an effort the more,"
5815,ON GROWING OLD,Though his heart thumped like drum-beats as he went to the fore.
5816,ON GROWING OLD,
5817,ON GROWING OLD,"Neck and neck went Sir Lopez and Soyland together,"
5818,ON GROWING OLD,"Soyland first, a short head, with his neck all in lather;"
5819,ON GROWING OLD,"Both were ridden their hardest, both were doing their best,"
5820,ON GROWING OLD,Right Royal reached Soyland and came to his chest.
5821,ON GROWING OLD,
5822,ON GROWING OLD,"There Soyland’s man saw him with the heel of his eye,"
5823,ON GROWING OLD,A horse with an effort that could beat him or tie;
5824,ON GROWING OLD,"Then he glanced at Sir Lopez, and he bit through his lip,"
5825,ON GROWING OLD,And he drove in his spurs and he took up his whip.
5826,ON GROWING OLD,
5827,ON GROWING OLD,"There he lashed the game Soyland who had given his all,"
5828,ON GROWING OLD,"And he gave three strides more, and then failed at the call,"
5829,ON GROWING OLD,And he dropped behind Royal like a leaf in a tide:
5830,ON GROWING OLD,Then Sir Lopez and Royal ran on side by side.
5831,ON GROWING OLD,
5832,ON GROWING OLD,"There they looked at each other, and they rode, and were grim;"
5833,ON GROWING OLD,"Charles thought, “That’s Sir Lopez. I shall never beat him.”"
5834,ON GROWING OLD,"All the yells for Sir Lopez seemed to darken the air,"
5835,ON GROWING OLD,They were rushing past Emmy and the White Post was there.
5836,ON GROWING OLD,
5837,ON GROWING OLD,He drew to Sir Lopez; but Sir Lopez drew clear;
5838,ON GROWING OLD,Right Royal clung to him and crept to his ear.
5839,ON GROWING OLD,Then the man on Sir Lopez judged the moment had come
5840,ON GROWING OLD,For the last ounce of effort that would bring his horse home.
5841,ON GROWING OLD,
5842,ON GROWING OLD,"So he picked up his whip for three swift slashing blows,"
5843,ON GROWING OLD,"And Sir Lopez drew clear, but Right Royal stuck close,"
5844,ON GROWING OLD,"Then he gained, past his withers, past his neck to his head."
5845,ON GROWING OLD,"With Sir Lopez’ man lashing, Charles still, seeing red."
5846,ON GROWING OLD,
5847,ON GROWING OLD,"So they rushed for one second, then Sir Lopez shot out:"
5848,ON GROWING OLD,"Charles thought, “There, he’s done me, without any doubt."
5849,ON GROWING OLD,"Oh, come now, Right Royal!”"
5850,ON GROWING OLD,And Sir Lopez changed feet
5851,ON GROWING OLD,And his ears went back level; Sir Lopez was beat.
5852,ON GROWING OLD,
5853,ON GROWING OLD,"Right Royal went past him, half an inch, half a head,"
5854,ON GROWING OLD,"Half a neck, he was leading, for an instant he led;"
5855,ON GROWING OLD,"Then a hooped black and coral flew up like a shot,"
5856,ON GROWING OLD,With a lightning-like effort from little Gavotte.
5857,ON GROWING OLD,
5858,ON GROWING OLD,"The little bright mare, made of nerves and steel springs,"
5859,ON GROWING OLD,"Shot level beside him, shot ahead as with wings."
5860,ON GROWING OLD,"Charles felt his horse quicken, felt the desperate beat"
5861,ON GROWING OLD,Of the blood in his body from his knees to his feet.
5862,ON GROWING OLD,
5863,ON GROWING OLD,"Three terrible strides brought him up to the mare,"
5864,ON GROWING OLD,Then they rushed to wild shouting through a whirl of blow air;
5865,ON GROWING OLD,Then Gavotte died to nothing; Soyland came once again
5866,ON GROWING OLD,Till his muzzle just reached to the knot on his rein.
5867,ON GROWING OLD,
5868,ON GROWING OLD,"Then a whirl of urged horses thundered up, whipped and blown,"
5869,ON GROWING OLD,"Soyland, Peterkinooks, and Red Ember the roan."
5870,ON GROWING OLD,"For an instant they challenged, then they drooped and were done;"
5871,ON GROWING OLD,"Then the White Post shot backwards, Right Royal had won."
5872,ON GROWING OLD,
5873,ON GROWING OLD,"Won a half length from Soyland, Red Ember close third;"
5874,ON GROWING OLD,"Fourth, Peterkinooks; fifth, Gavotte harshly spurred;"
5875,ON GROWING OLD,"Sixth, Sir Lopez, whose rider said, “Just at the Straight"
5876,ON GROWING OLD,He swerved at the hurdle and twisted a plate.”
5877,ON GROWING OLD,
5878,ON GROWING OLD,Then the numbers went up; then John Harding appeared
5879,ON GROWING OLD,To lead in the Winner while the bookmakers cheered.
5880,ON GROWING OLD,"Then the riders weighed-in, and the meeting was over,"
5881,ON GROWING OLD,And bright Emmy Crowthorne could go with her lover.
5882,ON GROWING OLD,
5883,ON GROWING OLD,"Charles married his lady, but he rode no more races;"
5884,ON GROWING OLD,"He lives on the Downland on the blown grassy places,"
5885,ON GROWING OLD,Where he and Right Royal can canter for hours
5886,ON GROWING OLD,On the flock-bitten turf full of tiny blue flowers.
5887,ON GROWING OLD,
5888,ON GROWING OLD,"There the Roman pitcht camp, there the Saxon kept sheep,"
5889,ON GROWING OLD,"There he lives out this Living that no man can keep,"
5890,ON GROWING OLD,"That is manful but a moment before it must pass,"
5891,ON GROWING OLD,"Like the stars sweeping westward, like the wind on the grass."

5997,AHASUERUS.,
5998,AHASUERUS.,What is the time? I hear the water drip
5999,AHASUERUS.,"Telling the time; and all the Court is still,"
6000,AHASUERUS.,Still as the midnight; not a footstep stirs
6001,AHASUERUS.,Save the slow sentry on the palace wall.
6002,AHASUERUS.,No glow of light is in the eastern heaven;
6003,AHASUERUS.,"The barren, dwindled moon her ruddy horn"
6004,AHASUERUS.,"Heaves o’er the tree-tops; it is midnight, sure."
6005,AHASUERUS.,"I see Orion falling, and the Dog"
6006,AHASUERUS.,Bright at his heels. Deep midnight. Not a sound
6007,AHASUERUS.,Save the most patient mouse that gnaws the wainscot.
6008,AHASUERUS.,
6009,AHASUERUS.,[_He rises and walks._]
6010,AHASUERUS.,
6011,AHASUERUS.,"O weary Time, I cannot sleep to-night."
6012,AHASUERUS.,"All still, all sleep, save only I the King."
6013,AHASUERUS.,And that great city at the palace foot
6014,AHASUERUS.,Lies sleeping; yet a strange fear troubles me
6015,AHASUERUS.,"That some there do not sleep, but prepare evil;"
6016,AHASUERUS.,"Evil against myself, against the King."
6017,AHASUERUS.,"Those foreigners whom Haman told me of,"
6018,AHASUERUS.,"The Jews, who are to die, as Haman urged."
6019,AHASUERUS.,"Excellent Haman, guardian of my throne."
6020,AHASUERUS.,It may be that this warning comes too late.
6021,AHASUERUS.,What if those Jews be coming even now
6022,AHASUERUS.,By the black alleys of that sleeping city
6023,AHASUERUS.,"Into my palace, up the guarded stairs"
6024,AHASUERUS.,"From floor to floor, along the corridors,"
6025,AHASUERUS.,"Stealthily, with masked eyes, with bated breath,"
6026,AHASUERUS.,On tiptoe to the threshold of my room.
6027,AHASUERUS.,That captain of my guard has eyed me strangely
6028,AHASUERUS.,These two nights now; he had an evil look.
6029,AHASUERUS.,"He smiled, but still, his eyes they did not smile."
6030,AHASUERUS.,Where is my sword? It’s here. Look at that door.
6031,AHASUERUS.,It moved. Was that the wind? Who stands without?
6032,AHASUERUS.,"I see you standing there. Come in there, you."
6033,AHASUERUS.,Who is it?
6034,AHASUERUS.,
6035,AHASUERUS.,GUARD [_Off_].
6036,AHASUERUS.,
6037,AHASUERUS.,The great King’s guard is here.
6038,AHASUERUS.,God save the King! And may he live for ever!
6039,AHASUERUS.,
6040,AHASUERUS.,AHASUERUS.
6041,AHASUERUS.,
6042,AHASUERUS.,Give me a cup of drink. I thirst. I thank you.
6043,AHASUERUS.,You men were sleeping when I called for you.
6044,AHASUERUS.,"Sing, that I know you watching till I sleep."
6045,AHASUERUS.,
6046,AHASUERUS.,[_The_ SOLDIERS _hum and sing together_.
6047,AHASUERUS.,AHASUERUS _settles to his sleep again_.
6048,AHASUERUS.,_He rouses up and walks again._]
6049,AHASUERUS.,
6050,AHASUERUS.,There is a something evil in this room;
6051,AHASUERUS.,I seem to give it power by lying down.
6052,AHASUERUS.,It is as though the dark were full of souls
6053,AHASUERUS.,That wait till I am helpless and then come
6054,AHASUERUS.,"Out of the corners, out of the air itself,"
6055,AHASUERUS.,"About my body; but, being up, they fly."
6056,AHASUERUS.,"See, there is nothing here. I pass my hand--"
6057,AHASUERUS.,
6058,AHASUERUS.,[_He goes round feeling the walls._]
6059,AHASUERUS.,
6060,AHASUERUS.,"Here, here, and here. I do not like that corner:"
6061,AHASUERUS.,Is the thing there? The shadow on the wall
6062,AHASUERUS.,Is like the black head of an African
6063,AHASUERUS.,"Thrown back in mockery, and it seems to move--"
6064,AHASUERUS.,To move a little forward. It is but shadow.
6065,AHASUERUS.,"Yes, you are only shadow on the wall,"
6066,AHASUERUS.,Not what you thought.
6067,AHASUERUS.,And yet I know this room
6068,AHASUERUS.,Is living with the spirits of evil things;
6069,AHASUERUS.,Spirits of evil things that I have done.
6070,AHASUERUS.,"It is so difficult to be a King,"
6071,AHASUERUS.,To wear the crown and to be ringed with death;
6072,AHASUERUS.,"To order “Thus,” with little time to think,"
6073,AHASUERUS.,"No time to know, but to be just, far-seeing,"
6074,AHASUERUS.,"Wise, generous, strict and yet most merciful,"
6075,AHASUERUS.,As though one knew.
6076,AHASUERUS.,"Now one by one they come,"
6077,AHASUERUS.,"Those plotters who defied me, whom I killed,"
6078,AHASUERUS.,"Crucified, burned, impaled, or tore with horses,"
6079,AHASUERUS.,"Men who with white lips cursed me, going to death."
6080,AHASUERUS.,
6081,AHASUERUS.,[_He turns._]
6082,AHASUERUS.,
6083,AHASUERUS.,"Yes, you pale ghosts, I mastered you in life,"
6084,AHASUERUS.,"And will in death. I hold an Empire up,"
6085,AHASUERUS.,A thing that IS; no glimmering dream of boys
6086,AHASUERUS.,"Or what might be, but will not till men change;"
6087,AHASUERUS.,No phantom Paradise of vengeance glutted
6088,AHASUERUS.,"By poor men upon rich men, but a world"
6089,AHASUERUS.,Rising and doing its work and lying down
6090,AHASUERUS.,Because my fierceness keeps the wolves at bay.
6091,AHASUERUS.,"And yet, those Jews, even at my palace door,"
6092,AHASUERUS.,"So Haman said, have had my death contrived."
6093,AHASUERUS.,What if that captain be in league with them?
6094,AHASUERUS.,Guard! Is Hydaspes there?
6095,AHASUERUS.,
6096,GUARD.,GUARD.

6173,AHASUERUS.,"Do they, by Heaven; as a dead man does."
6174,AHASUERUS.,"Wisdom is life upon the tickle edge,"

6254,AHASUERUS.,"These times are dangerous. Go now from here,"
6255,AHASUERUS.,See the guards doubled at Queen Esther’s doors.
6256,AHASUERUS.,These Jews are secret like that desert tribe
6257,AHASUERUS.,"Whom none has seen, who walk the moonless night"
6258,AHASUERUS.,"And strike men dead, and go, and leave no trace"

6275,AHASUERUS.,"She disobeyed my order at the feast,"

6278,AHASUERUS.,"Plot, plot and counter-plot, and none to comfort,"
6279,AHASUERUS.,"Nor to advise, as Vashti used to do."
6280,AHASUERUS.,Was it a plot that made her disobey?
6281,AHASUERUS.,I sent Prince Memucan to bring her to me:
6282,AHASUERUS.,He brought back word that she refused to come.
6283,AHASUERUS.,How if Prince Memucan were lying to me?
6284,AHASUERUS.,"Misquoting what she said, to make me rage"

6288,AHASUERUS.,Who are the comrades of Prince Memucan?

6293,AHASUERUS.,"And yet, what if the two conspired together"

6295,AHASUERUS.,I will send Memucan beyond the seas
6296,AHASUERUS.,Upon some dangerous mission of great honour:
6297,AHASUERUS.,He shall away to-morrow in all haste.
6298,AHASUERUS.,But Haman I can trust.

6315,AHASUERUS.,Horrible white face with the blotch of death;
6316,AHASUERUS.,Harbonah gave it in the honey cake--
