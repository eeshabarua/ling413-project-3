263,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,
264,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,
265,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,Sedley was one of those characters who exert a personal fascination over
266,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,their own age without leaving any works behind them to perpetuate the
267,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"charm to posterity. He was the son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford, in"
268,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Kent, and was born in 1639. When the Restoration took place he repaired"
269,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"to London, and plunged into all the licence of the time, shedding,"
270,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"however, over the putrid pool the sheen of his wit, manners, and genius."
271,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Charles was so delighted with him, that he is said to have asked him"
272,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,whether he had not obtained a patent from Nature to be Apollo's viceroy.
273,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"He cracked jests, issued lampoons, wrote poems and plays, and, despite"
274,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"some great blunders, was universally admired and loved. When his comedy"
275,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"of 'Bellamira' was acted, the roof fell in, and a few, including the"
276,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"author, were slightly injured. When a parasite told him that the fire of"
277,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"the play had blown up the poet, house and all, Sedley replied, 'No; the"
278,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"play was so heavy that it broke down the house, and buried the poet in"
279,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"his own rubbish.' Latterly he sobered down, entered parliament, attended"
280,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"closely to public business, and became a determined opponent of the"
281,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,arbitrary measures of James II. To this he was stimulated by a personal
282,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"reason. James had seduced Sedley's daughter, and made her Countess of"
283,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Dorchester. 'For making my daughter a countess,' the father said, 'I"
284,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"have helped to make his daughter' (Mary, Princess of Orange,) 'a queen.'"
285,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"Sedley, thus talking, acting, and writing, lived on till he was sixty-"
286,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,two years of age. He died in 1701.
287,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,
288,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"He has left nothing that the world can cherish, except such light and"
289,SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.,"graceful songs, sparkling rather with point than with poetry, as we"

378,"JOHN POMFRET,",
379,"JOHN POMFRET,","The author of the once popular 'Choice,' was born in 1667. He was the"
380,"JOHN POMFRET,","son of the rector of Luton, in Bedfordshire, and, after attending"
381,"JOHN POMFRET,","Queen's College, Cambridge, himself entered the Church. He became"
382,"JOHN POMFRET,","minister of Malden, which is also situated in Bedfordshire, and there he"
383,"JOHN POMFRET,","wrote and, in 1699, published a volume of poems, including some Pindaric"
384,"JOHN POMFRET,","essays, in the style of Cowley and 'The Choice.' He might have risen"
385,"JOHN POMFRET,","higher in his profession, but Dr Compton, Bishop of London, was"
386,"JOHN POMFRET,",prejudiced against him on account of the following lines in the
387,"JOHN POMFRET,",'Choice:'--
388,"JOHN POMFRET,",
389,"JOHN POMFRET,","'And as I near approached the verge of life,"
390,"JOHN POMFRET,",Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)
391,"JOHN POMFRET,","Should take upon him all my worldly care,"
392,"JOHN POMFRET,",Whilst I did for a better state prepare.'
393,"JOHN POMFRET,",
394,"JOHN POMFRET,","The words in the second line, coupled with a glowing description, in a"
395,"JOHN POMFRET,","previous part of the poem, of his ideal of an 'obliging modest fair'"
396,"JOHN POMFRET,","one, near whom he wished to live, led to the suspicion that he preferred"
397,"JOHN POMFRET,",a mistress to a wife. In vain did he plead that he was actually a
398,"JOHN POMFRET,","married man. His suit for a better living made no progress, and while"
399,"JOHN POMFRET,","dancing attendance on his patron in London he caught small-pox, and died"
400,"JOHN POMFRET,","in 1703, in the thirty-sixth year of his age."
401,"JOHN POMFRET,",
402,"JOHN POMFRET,","His Pindaric odes, &c., are feeble spasms, and need not detain us. His"
403,"JOHN POMFRET,",'Reason' shews considerable capacity and common sense. His 'Choice'
404,"JOHN POMFRET,","opens up a pleasing vista, down which our quiet ancestors delighted to"
405,"JOHN POMFRET,","look, but by which few now can be attracted. We quote a portion of what"
406,"JOHN POMFRET,","a biographer calls a 'modest' preface, which Pomfret prefixed to his"
407,"JOHN POMFRET,","poems:--'To please every one would be a new thing, and to write so as to"
408,"JOHN POMFRET,",please nobody would be as new; for even Quarles and Withers have their
409,"JOHN POMFRET,","admirers. It is not the multitude of applauses, but the good sense of"
410,"JOHN POMFRET,",the applauders which establishes a valuable reputation; and if a Rymer
411,"JOHN POMFRET,","or a Congreve say it is well, he will not be at all solicitous how great"
412,"JOHN POMFRET,",the majority be to the contrary.' How strangely are opinions now
413,"JOHN POMFRET,",altered! Rymer was some time ago characterised by Macaulay as the worst
414,"JOHN POMFRET,","critic that ever lived, and Quarles and Withers have now many admirers,"
415,"JOHN POMFRET,",while 'The Choice' and its ill-fated author are nearly forgotten.

446,THE CHOICE.,"With all those moderns, men of steady sense,"

474,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"he sat for East Grinstead, in Surrey, and might have distinguished"
475,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"himself, had he not determined, in common with almost all the wits of"
476,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"the time, to run a preliminary career of dissipation. What a proof of"
477,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"the licentiousness of these times is to be found in the fact, that young"
478,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Lord Buckhurst, Sir Charles Sedley, and Sir Thomas Ogle were fined for"
479,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"exposing themselves, drunk and naked, in indecent postures on the public"
480,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"street! In 1665, the erratic energies of Buckhurst found a more"
481,THE EARL OF DORSET.,legitimate vent in the Dutch war. He attended the Duke of York in the
482,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"great sea-fight of the 3d June, in which Opdam, the Dutch admiral, was,"
483,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"with all his crew, blown up. He is said to have composed the song,"
484,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"quoted afterwards, 'To all you ladies now at land,' on the evening"
485,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"before the battle, although Dr Johnson (who observes that seldom any"
486,THE EARL OF DORSET.,splendid story is wholly true) maintains that its composition cost him
487,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"a whole week, and that he only retouched it on that remarkable evening."
488,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Buckhurst was soon after made a gentleman of the bed-chamber, and"
489,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"despatched on short embassies to France. In 1674, his uncle, James"
490,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Cranfield, the Earl of Middlesex, died, and left him his estate, and"
491,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"the next year the title, too, was conferred on him. In 1677, he became,"
492,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"by the death of his father, Earl of Dorset, and inherited the family"
493,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"estate. In 1684, his wife, whose name was Bagot, and by whom he had no"
494,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"children, died, and he soon after married a daughter of the Earl of"
495,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Northampton, who is said to have been celebrated both for understanding"
496,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"and beauty. Dorset was courted by James, but found it impossible to"
497,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"coincide with his violent measures, and when the bishops were tried"
498,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"at Westminster Hall, he, along with some other lords, appeared to"
499,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"countenance them. He concurred with the Revolution settlement, and,"
500,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"after William's accession, was created lord chamberlain of the"
501,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"household, and received the Order of the Garter. His attendance on the"
502,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"king, however, eventually cost him his life, for having been tossed with"
503,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"him in an open boat on the coast of Holland for sixteen hours, in very"
504,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"rough weather, he caught an illness from which he never recovered. On"
505,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"19th January 1705-6, he died at Bath."
506,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
507,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"During his life, Dorset was munificent in his kindness to such men of"
508,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"genius as Prior and Dryden, who repaid him in the current coin of the"
509,THE EARL OF DORSET.,poor Parnassus of their day--gross adulation. He is now remembered
510,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"mainly for his spirited war-song, and for such pointed lines in his"
511,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"satire on Edward Howard, the notorious author of 'British Princes,' as"
512,THE EARL OF DORSET.,the following:--
513,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
514,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"'They lie, dear Ned, who say thy brain is barren,"
515,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"When deep conceits, like maggots, breed in carrion;"
516,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Thy stumbling, foundered jade can trot as high"
517,THE EARL OF DORSET.,As any other Pegasus can fly.
518,THE EARL OF DORSET.,So the dull eel moves nimbler in the mud
519,THE EARL OF DORSET.,Than all the swift-finned racers of the flood.
520,THE EARL OF DORSET.,As skilful divers to the bottom fall
521,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"Sooner than those who cannot swim at all,"
522,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"So in this way of writing without thinking,"
523,THE EARL OF DORSET.,Thou hast a strange alacrity in sinking.'
524,THE EARL OF DORSET.,
525,THE EARL OF DORSET.,"This last line has not only become proverbial, but forms the distinct"
526,THE EARL OF DORSET.,germ of 'The Dunciad.'

626,JOHN PHILIPS.,
627,JOHN PHILIPS.,
628,JOHN PHILIPS.,Bampton in Oxfordshire was the birthplace of this poet. He was born
629,JOHN PHILIPS.,"on the 30th of December 1676. His father, Dr Stephen Philips, was"
630,JOHN PHILIPS.,"archdeacon of Salop, as well as minister of Bampton. John, after some"
631,JOHN PHILIPS.,"preliminary training at home, was sent to Winchester, where he"
632,JOHN PHILIPS.,"distinguished himself by diligence and good-nature, and enjoyed two"
633,JOHN PHILIPS.,"great luxuries,--the reading of Milton, and the having his head combed"
634,JOHN PHILIPS.,by some one while he sat still and in rapture for hours together. This
635,JOHN PHILIPS.,"pleasure he shared with Vossius, and with humbler persons of our"
636,JOHN PHILIPS.,"acquaintance; the combing of whose hair, they tell us,"
637,JOHN PHILIPS.,
638,JOHN PHILIPS.,"'Dissolves them into ecstasies,"
639,JOHN PHILIPS.,And brings all heaven before their eyes.'
640,JOHN PHILIPS.,
641,JOHN PHILIPS.,"In 1694, he entered Christ Church, Cambridge. His intention was to"
642,JOHN PHILIPS.,"prosecute the study of medicine, and he took great delight in the"
643,JOHN PHILIPS.,cognate pursuits of natural history and botany. His chief friend was
644,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Edmund Smith, (Rag Smith, as he was generally called,) a kind of minor"
645,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Savage, well known in these times as the author of 'Phaedra and"
646,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Hippolytus,' and for his cureless dissipation. In 1703, Philips produced"
647,JOHN PHILIPS.,"'The Splendid Shilling,' which proved a hit, and seems to have diverted"
648,JOHN PHILIPS.,his aspirations from the domains of Aesculapius to those of Apollo.
649,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Bolingbroke sought him out, and employed him, after the battle of"
650,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Blenheim, to sing it in opposition to Addison, the laureate of the"
651,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Whigs. At the house of the magnificent but unprincipled St John, Philips"
652,JOHN PHILIPS.,"wrote his 'Blenheim,' which was published in 1705. The year after, his"
653,JOHN PHILIPS.,"'Cider,' a poem in two books, appeared, and was received with great"
654,JOHN PHILIPS.,"applause. Encouraged by this, he projected a poem on the Last Day,"
655,JOHN PHILIPS.,"which all who are aware of the difficulties of the subject, and the"
656,JOHN PHILIPS.,"limitations of the author's genius, must rejoice that he never wrote."
657,JOHN PHILIPS.,Consumption and asthma removed him prematurely on the 15th of February
658,JOHN PHILIPS.,"1708, ere he had completed his thirty-third year. He was buried in"
659,JOHN PHILIPS.,"Hereford Cathedral, and Sir Simon Harcourt, afterwards Lord Chancellor,"
660,JOHN PHILIPS.,erected a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey.
661,JOHN PHILIPS.,
662,JOHN PHILIPS.,Bulwer somewhere records a story of John Martin in his early days. He
663,JOHN PHILIPS.,"was, on one occasion, reduced to his last shilling. He had kept it, out"
664,JOHN PHILIPS.,"of a heap, from a partiality to its appearance. It was very bright. He"
665,JOHN PHILIPS.,"was compelled, at last, to part with it. He went out to a baker's shop"
666,JOHN PHILIPS.,to purchase a loaf with his favourite shilling. He had got the loaf into
667,JOHN PHILIPS.,"his hands, when the baker discovered that the shilling was a bad one,"
668,JOHN PHILIPS.,"and poor Martin had to resign the loaf, and take back his dear, bright,"
669,JOHN PHILIPS.,bad shilling once more. Length of time and cold criticism in like manner
670,JOHN PHILIPS.,"have reduced John Philips to his solitary 'Splendid Shilling.' But,"
671,JOHN PHILIPS.,"though bright, it is far from bad. It is one of the cleverest of"
672,JOHN PHILIPS.,"parodies, and is perpetrated against one of those colossal works which"
673,JOHN PHILIPS.,the smiles of a thousand caricatures were unable to injure. No great or
674,JOHN PHILIPS.,good poem was ever hurt by its parody:--the 'Paradise Lost' was not by
675,JOHN PHILIPS.,'The Splendid Shilling'--'The Last Man' of Campbell was not by 'The Last
676,JOHN PHILIPS.,Man' of Hood--nor the 'Lines on the Burial of Sir John Moore' by their
677,JOHN PHILIPS.,"witty, well-known caricature; and if 'The Vision of Judgment' by Southey"
678,JOHN PHILIPS.,"was laughed into oblivion by Byron's poem with the same title, it was"
679,JOHN PHILIPS.,"because Southey's original was neither good nor great. Philip's poem,"
680,JOHN PHILIPS.,"too, is the first of the kind; and surely we should be thankful to the"
681,JOHN PHILIPS.,author of the earliest effort in a style which has created so much
682,JOHN PHILIPS.,innocent amusement. Dr Johnson speaks as if the pleasure arising from
683,JOHN PHILIPS.,such productions implied a malignant 'momentary triumph over that
684,JOHN PHILIPS.,"grandeur which had hitherto held its captives in admiration.' We think,"
685,JOHN PHILIPS.,"on the contrary, that it springs from our deep interest in the original"
686,JOHN PHILIPS.,"production, making us alive to the strange resemblance the caricature"
687,JOHN PHILIPS.,"bears to it. It is our love that provokes our laughter, and hence the"
688,JOHN PHILIPS.,admirers of the parodied poem are more delighted than its enemies. At
689,JOHN PHILIPS.,"all events, it is by 'The Splendid Shilling' alone--and that principally"
690,JOHN PHILIPS.,from its connexion with Milton's great work--that Philips is memorable.
691,JOHN PHILIPS.,"His 'Cider' has soured with age, and the loud echo of his Blenheim"
692,JOHN PHILIPS.,battle-piece has long since died away.

1294,THOMAS TICKELL.,
1295,THOMAS TICKELL.,
1296,THOMAS TICKELL.,Tickell is now chiefly remembered from his connexion with Addison. He
1297,THOMAS TICKELL.,"was born in 1686, at Bridekirk, near Carlisle. In April 1701, he became"
1298,THOMAS TICKELL.,"a member of Queen's College in Oxford. In 1708, he was made M.A., and"
1299,THOMAS TICKELL.,"two years after was chosen Fellow. He held his Fellowship till 1726,"
1300,THOMAS TICKELL.,"when, marrying in Dublin, he necessarily vacated it. He attracted"
1301,THOMAS TICKELL.,"Addison's attention first by some elegant lines in praise of Rosamond,"
1302,THOMAS TICKELL.,"and then by the 'Prospect of Peace,' a poem in which Tickell, although"
1303,THOMAS TICKELL.,"called by Swift Whiggissimus, for once took the Tory side. This poem"
1304,THOMAS TICKELL.,"Addison, in spite of its politics, praised highly in the _Spectator_,"
1305,THOMAS TICKELL.,which led to a lifelong friendship between them. Tickell commenced
1306,THOMAS TICKELL.,"contributing to the _Spectator_, among other things publishing there a"
1307,THOMAS TICKELL.,"poem entitled the 'Royal Progress.' Some time after, he produced a"
1308,THOMAS TICKELL.,"translation of the first book of the Iliad, which Addison declared to be"
1309,THOMAS TICKELL.,superior to Pope's. This led the latter to imagine that it was Addison's
1310,THOMAS TICKELL.,"own, although it is now, we believe, certain, from the MS., which still"
1311,THOMAS TICKELL.,"exists, that it was a veritable production of Tickell's. When Addison"
1312,THOMAS TICKELL.,"went to Ireland, as secretary to Lord Sunderland, Tickell accompanied"
1313,THOMAS TICKELL.,"him, and was employed in public business. When Addison became Secretary"
1314,THOMAS TICKELL.,"of State, he made Tickell Under-Secretary; and when he died, he left him"
1315,THOMAS TICKELL.,"the charge of publishing his works, with an earnest recommendation to"
1316,THOMAS TICKELL.,"the care of Craggs. Tickell faithfully performed the task, prefixing to"
1317,THOMAS TICKELL.,"them an elegy on his departed friend, which is now his own chief title"
1318,THOMAS TICKELL.,"to fame. In 1725, he was made secretary to the Lords-Justices of"
1319,THOMAS TICKELL.,"Ireland, a place of great trust and honour, and which he retained till"
1320,THOMAS TICKELL.,"his death. This event happened at Bath, in the year 1740."
1321,THOMAS TICKELL.,
1322,THOMAS TICKELL.,"His genius was not strong, but elegant and refined, and appears, as we"
1323,THOMAS TICKELL.,"have just stated, to best advantage in his lines on Addison's death,"
1324,THOMAS TICKELL.,"which are warm with genuine love, tremulous with sincere sorrow, and"
1325,THOMAS TICKELL.,"shine with a sober splendour, such as Addison's own exquisite taste"
1326,THOMAS TICKELL.,would have approved.

1606,RICHARD SAVAGE.,Savage must excuse our doing more than mentioning the leading dates of
1607,RICHARD SAVAGE.,his history. He was the son of the Earl of Rivers and the Countess of
1608,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"Macclesfield, and was born in London, 1698. His mother, who had begot"
1609,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"him in adultery after having openly avowed her criminality, in order to"
1610,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"obtain a divorce from her husband, placed the boy under the care of a"
1611,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"poor woman, who brought him up as her son. His maternal grandmother,"
1612,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"Lady Mason, however, took an interest him and placed him at a grammar"
1613,RICHARD SAVAGE.,school at St Alban's. He was afterwards apprenticed to a shoemaker. On
1614,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"the death of his nurse, he found some letters which led to the discovery"
1615,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"of his real parent. He applied to her, accordingly, to be acknowledged"
1616,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"as her son; but she repulsed his every advance, and persecuted him with"
1617,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"unrelenting barbarity. He found, however, some influential friends, such"
1618,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"as Steele, Fielding, Aaron Hill, Pope, and Lord Tyrconnell. He was,"
1619,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"however, his own worst enemy, and contracted habits of the most"
1620,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"irregular description. In a tavern brawl he killed one James Sinclair,"
1621,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"and was condemned to die; but, notwithstanding his mother's interference"
1622,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"to prevent the exercise of the royal clemency, he was pardoned by the"
1623,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"queen, who afterwards gave him a pension of £50 a-year. He supported"
1624,RICHARD SAVAGE.,himself in a precarious way by writing poetical pieces. Lord Tyrconnell
1625,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"took him for a while into his house, and allowed him £200 a-year, but he"
1626,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"soon quarrelled with him, and left. When the queen died he lost his"
1627,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"pension, but his friends made it up by an annuity to the same amount. He"
1628,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"went away to reside at Swansea, but on occasion of a visit he made to"
1629,RICHARD SAVAGE.,"Bristol he was arrested for a small debt, and in the prison he sickened,"

1829,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1830,JONATHAN SWIFT.,In contemplating the lives and works of the preceding poets in this
1831,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"third volume of 'Specimens,' we have been impressed with a sense, if not"
1832,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"of their absolute, yet of their comparative mediocrity. Beside such"
1833,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"neglected giants as Henry More, Joseph Beaumont, and Andrew Marvell, the"
1834,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Pomfrets, Sedleys, Blackmores, and Savages sink into insignificance. But"
1835,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"when we come to the name of Swift, we feel ourselves again approaching"
1836,JONATHAN SWIFT.,an Alpine region. The air of a stern mountain-summit breathes chill
1837,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"around our temples, and we feel that if we have no amiability to melt,"
1838,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"we have altitude at least to measure, and strange profound secrets of"
1839,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"nature, like the ravines of lofty hills, to explore. The men of the"
1840,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may be compared to Lebanon, or"
1841,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Snowdown, or Benlomond towering grandly over fertile valleys, on which"
1842,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"they smile--Swift to the tremendous Romsdale Horn in Norway, shedding"
1843,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"abroad, from a brow of four thousand feet high, what seems a scowl of"
1844,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"settled indignation, as if resolved not to rejoice even over the wide-"
1845,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"stretching deserts which, and nothing but which, it everlastingly"
1846,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"beholds. Mountains all of them, but what a difference between such a"
1847,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"mountain as Shakspeare, and such a mountain as Swift!"
1848,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1849,JONATHAN SWIFT.,Instead of going minutely over a path so long since trodden to mire as
1850,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"the life of Swift, let us expend a page or two in seeking to form some"
1851,JONATHAN SWIFT.,estimate of his character and genius. It is refreshing to come upon a
1852,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"new thing in the world, even though it be a strange or even a bad thing;"
1853,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and certainly, in any age and country, such a being as Swift must have"
1854,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"appeared an anomaly, not for his transcendent goodness, not for his"
1855,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"utter badness, but because the elements of good and evil were mixed in"
1856,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"him into a medley so astounding, and in proportions respectively so"
1857,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"large, yet unequal, that the analysis of the two seemed to many"
1858,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"competent only to the Great Chymist, Death, and that a sense of the"
1859,JONATHAN SWIFT.,disproportion seems to have moved the man himself to inextinguishable
1860,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"laughter,--a laughter which, radiating out of his own singular heart as"
1861,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"a centre, swept over the circumference of all beings within his reach,"
1862,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and returned crying, 'Give, give,' as if he were demanding a universal"
1863,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"sphere for the exercise of the savage scorn which dwelt within him, and"
1864,JONATHAN SWIFT.,as if he laughed not more 'consumedly' at others than he did at himself.
1865,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1866,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Ere speaking of Swift as a man, let us say something about his genius."
1867,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"That, like his character, was intensely peculiar. It was a compound of"
1868,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"infinite ingenuity, with very little poetical imagination--of gigantic"
1869,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"strength, with a propensity to incessant trifling--of passionate"
1870,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"purpose, with the clearest and coldest expression, as though a furnace"
1871,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"were fuelled with snow. A Brobdignagian by size, he was for ever toying"
1872,JONATHAN SWIFT.,with Lilliputian slings and small craft. One of the most violent of
1873,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"party men, and often fierce as a demoniac in temper, his favourite motto"
1874,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"was _Vive la bagatelle_. The creator of entire new worlds, we doubt if"
1875,JONATHAN SWIFT.,his works contain more than two or three lines of genuine poetry. He may
1876,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"be compared to one of the locusts of the Apocalypse, in that he had a"
1877,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"tail like unto a scorpion, and a sting in his tail; but his 'face is not"
1878,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"as the face of man, his hair is not as the hair of women, and on his"
1879,JONATHAN SWIFT.,head there is no crown like gold.' All Swift's creations are more or
1880,JONATHAN SWIFT.,less disgusting. Not one of them is beautiful. His Lilliputians are
1881,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"amazingly life-like, but compare them to Shakspeare's fairies, such"
1882,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"as Peaseblossom, Cobweb, and Mustardseed; his Brobdignagians are"
1883,JONATHAN SWIFT.,excrescences like enormous warts; and his Yahoos might have been spawned
1884,JONATHAN SWIFT.,in the nightmare of a drunken butcher. The same coarseness characterises
1885,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"his poems and his 'Tale of a Tub.' He might well, however, in his old"
1886,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"age, exclaim, in reference to the latter, 'Good God! what a genius I"
1887,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"had when I wrote that book!' It is the wildest, wittiest, wickedest,"
1888,JONATHAN SWIFT.,wealthiest book of its size in the English language. Thoughts and
1889,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"figures swarm in every corner of its pages, till you think of a"
1890,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"disturbed nest of angry ants, for all the figures and thoughts are black"
1891,JONATHAN SWIFT.,and bitter. One would imagine the book to have issued from a mind that
1892,JONATHAN SWIFT.,had been gathering gall as well as sense in an antenatal state of being.
1893,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1894,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Swift, in all his writings--sermons, political tracts, poems, and"
1895,JONATHAN SWIFT.,fictions--is essentially a satirist. He consisted originally of three
1896,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"principal parts,--sense, an intense feeling of the ludicrous, and"
1897,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"selfish passion; and these were sure, in certain circumstances, to"
1898,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"ferment into a spirit of satire, 'strong as death, and cruel as the"
1899,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"grave.' Born with not very much natural benevolence, with little purely"
1900,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"poetic feeling, with furious passions and unbounded ambition, he was"
1901,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"entirely dependent for his peace of mind upon success. Had he become, as"
1902,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"by his talents he was entitled to be, the prime minister of his day, he"
1903,JONATHAN SWIFT.,would have figured as a greater tyrant in the cabinet than even Chatham.
1904,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"But as he was prevented from being the first statesman, he became the"
1905,JONATHAN SWIFT.,first satirist of his time. From vain efforts to grasp supremacy for
1906,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"himself and his party, he retired growling to his Dublin den; and there,"
1907,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"as Haman thought scorn to lay his hand on Mordecai, but extended his"
1908,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"murderous purpose to all the people of the Jews,--and as Nero wished"
1909,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"that Rome had one neck, that he might destroy it at a blow,--so Swift"
1910,JONATHAN SWIFT.,was stung by his personal disappointment to hurl out scorn at man and
1911,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"suspicion at his Maker. It was not, it must be noticed, the evil which"
1912,JONATHAN SWIFT.,was in man which excited his hatred and contempt; it was man himself. He
1913,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"was not merely, as many are, disgusted with the selfish and malignant"
1914,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"elements which are mingled in man's nature and character, and disposed"
1915,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"to trace them to any cause save a Divine will, but he believed man to"
1916,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"be, as a whole, the work and child of the devil; and he told the"
1917,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"imaginary creator and creature to their face, what he thought the"
1918,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"truth,--'The devil is an ass.' His was the very madness of Manichaeism."
1919,JONATHAN SWIFT.,That heresy held that the devil was one of two aboriginal creative
1920,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"powers, but Swift seemed to believe at times that he was the only God."
1921,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"From a Yahoo man, it was difficult to avoid the inference of a demon"
1922,JONATHAN SWIFT.,deity. It is very laughable to find writers in _Blackwood_ and elsewhere
1923,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"striving to prove Swift a Christian, as if, whatever were his"
1924,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"professions, and however sincere he might be often in these, the whole"
1925,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"tendency of his writings, his perpetual and unlimited abuse of man's"
1926,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"body and soul, his denial of every human virtue, the filth he pours upon"
1927,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"every phase of human nature, and the doctrine he insinuates--that man"
1928,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"has fallen indeed, but fallen, not from the angel, but from the animal,"
1929,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"or, rather, is just a bungled brute,--were not enough to shew that"
1930,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"either his notions were grossly erroneous and perverted, or that he"
1931,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"himself deserved, like another Nebuchadnezzar, to be driven from men,"
1932,JONATHAN SWIFT.,and to have a beast's heart given unto him. Sometimes he reminds us of
1933,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"an impure angel, who has surprised man naked and asleep, looked at him"
1934,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"with microscopic eyes, ignored all his peculiar marks of fallen dignity"
1935,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and incipient godhood, and in heartless rhymes reported accordingly."
1936,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1937,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Swift belonged to the same school as Pope, although the feminine element"
1938,JONATHAN SWIFT.,which was in the latter modified and mellowed his feelings. Pope was a
1939,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"more successful and a happier man than Swift. He was much smaller, too,"
1940,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"in soul as well as in body, and his gall-organ was proportionably less."
1941,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"Pope's feeling to humanity was a tiny malice; Swift's became, at length,"
1942,JONATHAN SWIFT.,a black malignity. Pope always reminds us of an injured and pouting hero
1943,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"of Lilliput, 'doing well to be angry' under the gourd of a pocket-flap,"
1944,JONATHAN SWIFT.,or squealing out his griefs from the centre of an empty snuff-box; Swift
1945,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"is a man, nay, monster of misanthropy. In minute and microscopic vision"
1946,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"of human infirmities, Pope excels even Swift; but then you always"
1947,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"conceive Swift leaning down a giant, though gnarled, stature to behold"
1948,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"them, while Pope is on their level, and has only to look straight before"
1949,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"him. Pope's wrath is always measured; Swift's, as in the 'Legion-Club'"
1950,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"is a whirlwind of 'black fire and horror,' in the breath of which no"
1951,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"flesh can live, and against which genius and virtue themselves furnish"
1952,JONATHAN SWIFT.,no shield.
1953,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1954,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"After all, Swift might, perhaps, have put in the plea of Byron--"
1955,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1956,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"'All my faults perchance thou knowest,"
1957,JONATHAN SWIFT.,All my madness none can know.'
1958,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1959,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"There was a black spot of madness in his brain, and another black spot"
1960,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"in his heart; and the two at last met, and closed up his destiny in"
1961,JONATHAN SWIFT.,night. Let human nature forgive its most determined and systematic
1962,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"reviler, for the sake of the wretchedness in which he was involved all"
1963,JONATHAN SWIFT.,his life long. He was born (in 1667) a posthumous child; he was brought
1964,JONATHAN SWIFT.,up an object of charity; he spent much of his youth in dependence; he
1965,JONATHAN SWIFT.,had to leave his Irish college without a degree; he was flattered with
1966,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"hopes from King William and the Whigs, which were not fulfilled; he was"
1967,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"condemned to spend a great part of his life in Ireland, a country he"
1968,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"detested; he was involved--partly, no doubt, through his own blame--in"
1969,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"a succession of fruitless and miserable intrigues, alike of love and"
1970,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"politics; he was soured by want of success in England, and spoiled by"
1971,JONATHAN SWIFT.,enormous popularity in Ireland; he was tried by a kind of religious
1972,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"doubts, which would not go out to prayer or fasting; he was haunted by"
1973,JONATHAN SWIFT.,the fear of the dreadful calamity which at last befell him; his senses
1974,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"and his soul left him one by one; he became first giddy, then deaf, and"
1975,JONATHAN SWIFT.,then mad; his madness was of the most terrible sort--it was a 'silent
1976,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"rage;' for a year or two he lay dumb; and at last, on the 19th of"
1977,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"October 1745,"
1978,JONATHAN SWIFT.,
1979,JONATHAN SWIFT.,"'Swift expired, a driveller and a show,'"

2521,ON POETRY.,Where Pope will never show his face;
2522,ON POETRY.,Where Young must torture his invention
2523,ON POETRY.,"To flatter knaves, or lose his pension."
2524,ON POETRY.,
2525,ON POETRY.,But these are not a thousandth part
2526,ON POETRY.,Of jobbers in the poet's art;
2527,ON POETRY.,"Attending each his proper station,"

2529,ON POETRY.,"Through every alley to be found,"
2530,ON POETRY.,"In garrets high, or under ground;"
2531,ON POETRY.,"And when they join their pericranies,"
2532,ON POETRY.,Out skips a book of miscellanies.
2533,ON POETRY.,Hobbes clearly proves that every creature
2534,ON POETRY.,Lives in a state of war by nature;
2535,ON POETRY.,"The greater for the smallest watch,"
2536,ON POETRY.,But meddle seldom with their match.
2537,ON POETRY.,A whale of moderate size will draw
2538,ON POETRY.,A shoal of herrings down his maw;
2539,ON POETRY.,A fox with geese his belly crams;
2540,ON POETRY.,A wolf destroys a thousand lambs:
2541,ON POETRY.,"But search among the rhyming race,"
2542,ON POETRY.,The brave are worried by the base.
2543,ON POETRY.,"If on Parnassus' top you sit,"
2544,ON POETRY.,"You rarely bite, are always bit."
2545,ON POETRY.,Each poet of inferior size
2546,ON POETRY.,"On you shall rail and criticise,"
2547,ON POETRY.,And strive to tear you limb from limb;
2548,ON POETRY.,While others do as much for him.
2549,ON POETRY.,
2550,ON POETRY.,The vermin only tease and pinch
2551,ON POETRY.,Their foes superior by an inch:
2552,ON POETRY.,"So, naturalists observe, a flea"
2553,ON POETRY.,Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;
2554,ON POETRY.,"And these have smaller still to bite 'em,"
2555,ON POETRY.,And so proceed _ad infinitum_.
2556,ON POETRY.,Thus every poet in his kind
2557,ON POETRY.,Is bit by him that comes behind:
2558,ON POETRY.,"Who, though too little to be seen,"
2559,ON POETRY.,"Can tease, and gall, and give the spleen;"
2560,ON POETRY.,"Call dunces fools and sons of whores,"
2561,ON POETRY.,Lay Grub Street at each other's doors;

2564,ON POETRY.,"Complain, as many an ancient bard did,"
2565,ON POETRY.,How genius is no more rewarded;
2566,ON POETRY.,How wrong a taste prevails among us;
2567,ON POETRY.,How much our ancestors out-sung us;
2568,ON POETRY.,Can personate an awkward scorn
2569,ON POETRY.,For those who are not poets born;
2570,ON POETRY.,"And all their brother-dunces lash,"
2571,ON POETRY.,Who crowd the press with hourly trash.
2572,ON POETRY.,
2573,ON POETRY.,"O Grub Street! how do I bemoan thee,"
2574,ON POETRY.,Whose graceless children scorn to own thee!
2575,ON POETRY.,"Their filial piety forgot,"
2576,ON POETRY.,Deny their country like a Scot;
2577,ON POETRY.,"Though by their idiom and grimace,"
2578,ON POETRY.,They soon betray their native place.
2579,ON POETRY.,Yet thou hast greater cause to be
2580,ON POETRY.,"Ashamed of them, than they of thee,"

2582,ON POETRY.,Since first the court allowed them food.
2583,ON POETRY.,
2584,ON POETRY.,"Remains a difficulty still,"
2585,ON POETRY.,To purchase fame by writing ill.
2586,ON POETRY.,"From Flecknoe down to Howard's time,"
2587,ON POETRY.,How few have reached the low sublime!
2588,ON POETRY.,"For when our high-born Howard died,"
2589,ON POETRY.,Blackmore alone his place supplied;
2590,ON POETRY.,"And lest a chasm should intervene,"
2591,ON POETRY.,"When death had finished Blackmore's reign,"
2592,ON POETRY.,"The leaden crown devolved to thee,"
2593,ON POETRY.,Great poet of the Hollow Tree.
2594,ON POETRY.,But ah! how unsecure thy throne!
2595,ON POETRY.,A thousand bards thy right disown;
2596,ON POETRY.,"They plot to turn, in factious zeal,"

2600,ON POETRY.,
2601,ON POETRY.,In bulk there are not more degrees

2604,ON POETRY.,In creatures of the rhyming race.
2605,ON POETRY.,"From bad to worse, and worse, they fall;"
2606,ON POETRY.,But who can reach the worst of all?
2607,ON POETRY.,"For though in nature, depth and height"
2608,ON POETRY.,Are equally held infinite;
2609,ON POETRY.,"In poetry, the height we know;"
2610,ON POETRY.,'Tis only infinite below.
2611,ON POETRY.,"For instance, when you rashly think"
2612,ON POETRY.,"No rhymer can like Welsted sink,"
2613,ON POETRY.,"His merits balanced, you shall find"
2614,ON POETRY.,The laureate leaves him far behind;
2615,ON POETRY.,"Concannen, more aspiring bard,"

2623,ON POETRY.,
2624,ON POETRY.,"Oh, what indignity and shame,"
2625,ON POETRY.,"To prostitute the Muse's name,"
2626,ON POETRY.,"By flattering kings, whom Heaven designed"
2627,ON POETRY.,The plagues and scourges of mankind;
2628,ON POETRY.,"Bred up in ignorance and sloth,"
2629,ON POETRY.,And every vice that nurses both.
2630,ON POETRY.,
2631,ON POETRY.,"Fair Britain, in thy monarch blest,"
2632,ON POETRY.,Whose virtues bear the strictest test;
2633,ON POETRY.,"Whom never faction could bespatter,"

2637,ON POETRY.,What lineaments divine we trace
2638,ON POETRY.,"Through all his figure, mien, and face!"
2639,ON POETRY.,"Though peace with olive bind his hands,"
2640,ON POETRY.,Confessed the conquering hero stands.

2696,ON POETRY.,On Louis all his bards bestowed

2711,ON POETRY.,Yet why should we be laced so strait?
2712,ON POETRY.,I'll give my monarch butter weight;
2713,ON POETRY.,"And reason good, for many a year"
2714,ON POETRY.,Jove never intermeddled here:

2733,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2734,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,This maxim more than all the rest

2752,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,If in a battle you should find

2817,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Poor gentleman, he droops apace!"
2818,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,You plainly find it in his face.
2819,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,That old vertigo in his head
2820,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Will never leave him, till he's dead."
2821,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Besides, his memory decays:"
2822,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,He recollects not what he says;
2823,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,He cannot call his friends to mind;
2824,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Forgets the place where last he dined;
2825,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Plies you with stories o'er and o'er;
2826,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,He told them fifty times before.
2827,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,How does he fancy we can sit
2828,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,To hear his out-of-fashion wit?
2829,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"But he takes up with younger folks,"
2830,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Who for his wine will bear his jokes.
2831,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Faith! he must make his stories shorter,"
2832,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Or change his comrades once a quarter:
2833,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"In half the time he talks them round,"

2835,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2836,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"'For poetry, he's past his prime:"

2840,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,I'd have him throw away his pen;--
2841,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,But there's no talking to some men!'
2842,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2843,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,And then their tenderness appears
2844,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,By adding largely to my years:
2845,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"'He's older than he would be reckoned,"
2846,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,And well remembers Charles the Second.
2847,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,He hardly drinks a pint of wine;
2848,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"And that, I doubt, is no good sign."
2849,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,His stomach too begins to fail:
2850,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Last year we thought him strong and hale;
2851,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,But now he's quite another thing:
2852,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,I wish he may hold out till spring!'
2853,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"They hug themselves, and reason thus:"
2854,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,'It is not yet so bad with us!'
2855,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2856,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"In such a case, they talk in tropes,"
2857,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,And by their fears express their hopes.
2858,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Some great misfortune to portend,"
2859,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,No enemy can match a friend.
2860,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"With all the kindness they profess,"
2861,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,The merit of a lucky guess
2862,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"(When daily how-d'ye's come of course,"
2863,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"And servants answer, 'Worse and worse!')"
2864,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Would please them better, than to tell,"
2865,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"That, 'God be praised, the Dean is well.'"
2866,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Then he who prophesied the best,"
2867,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Approves his foresight to the rest:
2868,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"'You know I always feared the worst,"
2869,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,And often told you so at first.'
2870,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"He'd rather choose that I should die,"
2871,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Than his predictions prove a lie.
2872,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Not one foretells I shall recover;
2873,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,But all agree to give me over.
2874,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2875,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Yet, should some neighbour feel a pain"
2876,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Just in the parts where I complain;
2877,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,How many a message would he send!
2878,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,What hearty prayers that I should mend!
2879,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Inquire what regimen I kept;
2880,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"What gave me ease, and how I slept;"
2881,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"And more lament when I was dead,"
2882,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Than all the snivellers round my bed.
2883,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2884,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"My good companions, never fear;"
2885,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"For, though you may mistake a year,"
2886,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Though your prognostics run too fast,"
2887,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,They must be verified at last.
2888,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2889,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Behold the fatal day arrive!
2890,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,'How is the Dean?'--'He's just alive.'
2891,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Now the departing prayer is read;
2892,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,He hardly breathes--The Dean is dead.
2893,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2894,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Before the passing-bell begun,"
2895,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,The news through half the town is run.
2896,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,'Oh! may we all for death prepare!

2904,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"And had the Dean, in all the nation,"
2905,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"No worthy friend, no poor relation?"
2906,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"So ready to do strangers good,"
2907,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Forgetting his own flesh and blood!'
2908,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,
2909,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,Now Grub-Street wits are all employed;
2910,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,With elegies the town is cloyed:
2911,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"Some paragraph in every paper,"
2912,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"To curse the Dean, or bless the Drapier."
2913,ON THE DEATH OF DR SWIFT.,"The doctors, tender of their fame,"

3597,ISAAC WATTS.,"We feel relieved, and so doubtless do our readers, in passing from the"
3598,ISAAC WATTS.,"dark tragic story of Swift, and his dubious and unhappy character, to"
3599,ISAAC WATTS.,"contemplate the useful career of a much smaller, but a much better man,"
3600,ISAAC WATTS.,Isaac Watts. This admirable person was born at Southampton on the 17th
3601,ISAAC WATTS.,"of July 1674. His father, of the same name, kept a boarding-school for"
3602,ISAAC WATTS.,"young gentlemen, and was a man of intelligence and piety. Isaac was the"
3603,ISAAC WATTS.,"eldest of nine children, and began early to display precocity of genius."
3604,ISAAC WATTS.,"At four he commenced to study Latin at home, and afterwards, under one"
3605,ISAAC WATTS.,"Pinhorn, a clergyman, who kept the free-school at Southampton, he"
3606,ISAAC WATTS.,"learned Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. A subscription was proposed for"
3607,ISAAC WATTS.,"sending him to one of the great universities, but he preferred casting"
3608,ISAAC WATTS.,"in his lot with the Dissenters. He repaired accordingly, in 1690, to"
3609,ISAAC WATTS.,"an academy kept by the Rev. Thomas Rowe, whose son, we believe, became"
3610,ISAAC WATTS.,"the husband of the celebrated Elizabeth Rowe, the once popular author"
3611,ISAAC WATTS.,of 'Letters from the Dead to the Living.' The Rowes belonged to the
3612,ISAAC WATTS.,"Independent body. At this academy Watts began to write poetry, chiefly"
3613,ISAAC WATTS.,"in the Latin language, and in the then popular Pindaric measure. At the"
3614,ISAAC WATTS.,"age of twenty, he returned to his father's house, and spent two quiet"
3615,ISAAC WATTS.,"years in devotion, meditation, and study. He became next a tutor in the"
3616,ISAAC WATTS.,family of Sir John Hartopp for five years. He was afterwards chosen
3617,ISAAC WATTS.,"assistant to Dr Chauncey, and, after the Doctor's death, became his"
3618,ISAAC WATTS.,"successor. His health, however, failed, and, after getting an assistant"
3619,ISAAC WATTS.,"for a while, he was compelled to resign. In 1712, Sir Thomas Abney, a"
3620,ISAAC WATTS.,"benevolent gentleman of the neighbourhood, received Watts into his"
3621,ISAAC WATTS.,"house, where he continued during the rest of his life--all his wants"
3622,ISAAC WATTS.,"attended to, and his feeble frame so tenderly cared for that he lived"
3623,ISAAC WATTS.,to the age of seventy-five. Sir Thomas died eight years after Dr Watts
3624,ISAAC WATTS.,"entered his establishment, but the widow and daughters continued"
3625,ISAAC WATTS.,unwearied in their attentions. Abney House was a mansion surrounded by
3626,ISAAC WATTS.,"fine gardens and pleasure-grounds, where the Doctor became thoroughly"
3627,ISAAC WATTS.,"at home, and was wont to refresh his body and mind in the intervals"
3628,ISAAC WATTS.,"of study. He preached regularly to a congregation, and in the pulpit,"
3629,ISAAC WATTS.,"although his stature was low, not exceeding five feet, the excellence"
3630,ISAAC WATTS.,"of his matter, the easy flow of his language, and the propriety of his"
3631,ISAAC WATTS.,"pronunciation, rendered him very popular. In private he was exceedingly"
3632,ISAAC WATTS.,"kind to the poor and to children, giving to the former a third part"
3633,ISAAC WATTS.,"of his small income of £100 a-year, and writing for the other his"
3634,ISAAC WATTS.,"inimitable hymns. Besides these, he published a well-known treatise"
3635,ISAAC WATTS.,"on Logic, another on 'The Improvement of the Mind,' besides various"
3636,ISAAC WATTS.,"theological productions, amongst which his 'World to Come' has been"
3637,ISAAC WATTS.,"preeminently popular. In 1728, he received from Edinburgh and Aberdeen"
3638,ISAAC WATTS.,"an unsolicited diploma of Doctor of Divinity. As age advanced, he found"
3639,ISAAC WATTS.,"himself unable to discharge his ministerial duties, and offered to remit"
3640,ISAAC WATTS.,"his salary, but his congregation refused to accept his demission. On the"
3641,ISAAC WATTS.,"25th November 1748, quite worn out, but without suffering, this able and"
3642,ISAAC WATTS.,worthy man expired.
3643,ISAAC WATTS.,
3644,ISAAC WATTS.,"If to be eminently useful is to fulfil the highest purpose of humanity,"
3645,ISAAC WATTS.,it was certainly fulfilled by Isaac Watts. His logical and other
3646,ISAAC WATTS.,"treatises have served to brace the intellects, methodise the studies,"
3647,ISAAC WATTS.,and concentrate the activities of thousands--we had nearly said of
3648,ISAAC WATTS.,"millions of minds. This has given him an enviable distinction, but he"
3649,ISAAC WATTS.,shone still more in that other province he so felicitously chose and
3650,ISAAC WATTS.,so successfully occupied--that of the hearts of the young. One of his
3651,ISAAC WATTS.,detractors called him 'Mother Watts.' He might have taken up this
3652,ISAAC WATTS.,"epithet, and bound it as a crown unto him. We have heard of a pious"
3653,ISAAC WATTS.,"foreigner, possessed of imperfect English, who, in an agony of"
3654,ISAAC WATTS.,"supplication to God for some sick friend, said, 'O Fader, hear me!"
3655,ISAAC WATTS.,"O Mudder, hear me!' It struck us as one of the finest of stories, and"
3656,ISAAC WATTS.,containing one of the most beautiful tributes to the Deity we ever
3657,ISAAC WATTS.,"heard, recognising in Him a pity which not even a father, which only"
3658,ISAAC WATTS.,a mother can feel. Like a tender mother does good Watts bend over the
3659,ISAAC WATTS.,"little children, and secure that their first words of song shall be"
3660,ISAAC WATTS.,"those of simple, heartfelt trust in God, and of faith in their Elder"
3661,ISAAC WATTS.,"Brother. To create a little heaven in the nursery by hymns, and these"
3662,ISAAC WATTS.,"not mawkish or twaddling, but beautifully natural and exquisitely simple"
3663,ISAAC WATTS.,"breathings of piety and praise, was the high task to which Watts"
3664,ISAAC WATTS.,"consecrated, and by which he has immortalised, his genius."

4000,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"William Hamilton, of Bangour, was born in Ayrshire in 1704. He was of"
4001,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"an ancient family, and mingled from the first in the most fashionable"
4002,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,circles. Ere he was twenty he wrote verses in Ramsay's 'Tea-Table
4003,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"Miscellany.' In 1745, to the surprise of many, he joined the standard"
4004,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"of Prince Charles, and wrote a poem on the battle of Gladsmuir, or"
4005,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"Prestonpans. When the reverse of his party came, after many wanderings"
4006,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"and hair's-breadth escapes in the Highlands, he found refuge in France."
4007,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"As he was a general favourite, and as much allowance was made for his"
4008,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"poetical temperament, a pardon was soon procured for him by his friends,"
4009,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"and he returned to his native country. His health, however, originally"
4010,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"delicate, had suffered by his Highland privations, and he was compelled"
4011,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"to seek the milder clime of Lyons, where he died in 1754."
4012,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
4013,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"Hamilton was what is called a ladies'-man, but his attachments were not"
4014,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"deep, and he rather flirted than loved. A Scotch lady, who was annoyed"
4015,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"at his addresses, asked John Home how she could get rid of them. He,"
4016,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"knowing Hamilton well, advised her to appear to favour him. She acted on"
4017,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"the advice, and he immediately withdrew his suit. And yet his best poem"
4018,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"is a tale of love, and a tale, too, told with great simplicity and"
4019,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"pathos. We refer to his 'Braes of Yarrow,' the beauty of which we never"
4020,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"felt fully till we saw some time ago that lovely region, with its 'dowie"
4021,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"dens,'--its clear living stream,--Newark Castle, with its woods and"
4022,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"memories,--and the green wildernesses of silent hills which stretch on"
4023,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"all sides around; saw it, too, in that aspect of which Wordsworth sung"
4024,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,in the words--
4025,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
4026,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,'The grace of forest charms decayed
4027,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,And pastoral melancholy.'
4028,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,
4029,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,It is the highest praise we can bestow upon Hamilton's ballad that it
4030,WILLIAM HAMILTON.,"ranks in merit near Wordsworth's fine trinity of poems, 'Yarrow"

4190,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
4191,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
4192,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Crawford Muir, in Lanarkshire, was the birthplace of this true poet. His"
4193,ALLAN RAMSAY.,father was manager of the Earl of Hopetoun's lead-mines. Allan was born
4194,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"in 1686. His mother was Alice Bower, the daughter of an Englishman who"
4195,ALLAN RAMSAY.,had emigrated from Derbyshire. His father died while his son was yet in
4196,ALLAN RAMSAY.,infancy; his mother married again in the same district; and young Allan
4197,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"was educated at the parish school of Leadhills. At the age of fifteen,"
4198,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"he was sent to Edinburgh, and bound apprentice to a wig-maker there."
4199,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"This trade, however, he left after finishing his term. He displayed"
4200,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"rather early a passion for literature, and made a little reputation by"
4201,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"some pieces of verse,--such as 'An Address to the Easy Club,' a convivial"
4202,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"society with which he was connected,--and a considerable time after by"
4203,ALLAN RAMSAY.,a capital continuation of King James' 'Christis Kirk on the Green.'
4204,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"In 1712, he married a writer's daughter, Christiana Ross, who was his"
4205,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"affectionate companion for thirty years. Soon after, he set up a"
4206,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"bookseller's shop opposite Niddry's Wynd, and in this capacity edited"
4207,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"and published two collections,--the one of songs, some of them his own,"
4208,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"entitled 'The Tea-Table Miscellany,' and the other of early Scottish"
4209,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"poems, entitled 'The Evergreen.' In 1725, he published 'The Gentle"
4210,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Shepherd.' It was the expansion of one or two pastoral scenes which he
4211,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"ad shewn to his delighted friends. The poem became instantly popular,"
4212,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"and was republished in London and Dublin, and widely circulated in the"
4213,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"colonies. Pope admired it. Gay, then in Scotland with his patrons the"
4214,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Queensberry family, used to lounge into Ramsay's shop to get explanations"
4215,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"of its Scotch phrases to transmit to Twickenham, and to watch from the"
4216,ALLAN RAMSAY.,window the notable characters whom Allan pointed out to him in the
4217,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Edinburgh Exchange. He now removed to a better shop, and set up for his"
4218,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"sign the heads of Ben Jonson and Drummond, who agreed better in figure"
4219,ALLAN RAMSAY.,than they had done in reality at Hawthornden. He established the first
4220,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"circulating library in Scotland. His shop became a centre of intelligence,"
4221,ALLAN RAMSAY.,and Ramsay sat a Triton among the minnows of that rather mediocre day
4222,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"--giving his little senate laws, and inditing verses, songs, and fables."
4223,ALLAN RAMSAY.,At forty-five--an age when Sir Walter Scott had scarcely commenced his
4224,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Waverley novels, and Dryden had by far his greatest works to produce"
4225,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"--honest Allan imagined his vein exhausted, and ceased to write, although"
4226,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"he lived and enjoyed life for nearly thirty years more. At last, after"
4227,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"having lost money and gained obloquy, in a vain attempt to found the"
4228,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"first theatre in Edinburgh, and after building for himself a curious"
4229,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"octagon-shaped house on the north side of the Castle Hill, which, while"
4230,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"he called it Ramsay Lodge, his enemies nicknamed 'The Goose-pie,' and"
4231,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"which, though altered, still, we believe, stands, under the name of"
4232,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Ramsay Garden, the author of 'The Gentle Shepherd' breathed his last on"
4233,ALLAN RAMSAY.,the 7th of January 1758. He died of a scurvy in the gums. His son became
4234,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"a distinguished painter, intimate with Johnson, Burke, and the rest of"
4235,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"that splendid set, although now chiefly remembered from his connexion"
4236,ALLAN RAMSAY.,with them and with his father.
4237,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
4238,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Allan Ramsay was a poet with very few of the usual poetical faults. He
4239,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"had an eye for nature, but he had also an eye for the main chance. He"
4240,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"'kept his shop, and his shop kept him.' He might sing of intrigues, and"
4241,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"revels, and houses of indifferent reputation; but he was himself a"
4242,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"quiet, _canny_, domestic man, seen regularly at kirk and market. He had"
4243,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"a great reverence for the gentry, with whom he fancied himself, and"
4244,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"perhaps was, through the Dalhousie family, connected. He had a vast"
4245,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"opinion of himself; and between pride of blood, pride of genius, and"
4246,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"plenty of means, he was tolerably happy. How different from poor maudlin"
4247,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"Fergusson, or from that dark-browed, dark-eyed, impetuous being who was,"
4248,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"within a year of Ramsay's death, to appear upon the banks of Doon,"
4249,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"coming into the world to sing divinely, to act insanely, and prematurely"
4250,ALLAN RAMSAY.,to die!
4251,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
4252,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"A bard, in the highest use of the word, in which it approaches the"
4253,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"meaning of prophet, Ramsay was not, else he would not have ceased so"
4254,ALLAN RAMSAY.,soon to sing. Whatever lyrical impulse was in him speedily wore itself
4255,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"out, and left him to his milder mission as a broad reflector of Scottish"
4256,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"life--in its humbler, gentler, and better aspects. His 'Gentle Shepherd'"
4257,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"is a chapter of Scottish still-life; and, since the pastoral is"
4258,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"essentially the poetry of peace, the 'Gentle Shepherd' is the finest"
4259,ALLAN RAMSAY.,pastoral in the world. No thunders roll among these solitary crags; no
4260,ALLAN RAMSAY.,lightnings affright these lasses among their _claes_ at Habbie's Howe;
4261,ALLAN RAMSAY.,the air is still and soft; the plaintive bleating of the sheep upon the
4262,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"hills, the echoes of the city are distant and faintly heard, so that the"
4263,ALLAN RAMSAY.,very sounds seem in unison and in league with silence. One thinks of
4264,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Shelley's isle 'mid the Aegean deep:--
4265,ALLAN RAMSAY.,
4266,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"'It is an isle under Ionian skies,"
4267,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Beautiful as the wreck of Paradise;
4268,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"And for the harbours are not safe and good,"
4269,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"The land would have remained a solitude,"
4270,ALLAN RAMSAY.,"But for some pastoral people, native there,"
4271,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Who from the Elysian clear and sunny air

4283,ALLAN RAMSAY.,Yet in the little circle of calm carved out by the magician of 'The

4285,ALLAN RAMSAY.,love of the purest and warmest kind there breathes. The parade of

4935,ROBERT LLOYD.,Robert Lloyd was born in London in 1733. He was the son of one of the
4936,ROBERT LLOYD.,"under-masters of Westminster School. He went to Cambridge, where he"
4937,ROBERT LLOYD.,became distinguished for his talents and notorious for his dissipation.
4938,ROBERT LLOYD.,"He became an usher under his father, but soon tired of the drudgery, and"
4939,ROBERT LLOYD.,"commenced professional author. He published a poem called 'The Actor,'"
4940,ROBERT LLOYD.,"which attracted attention, and was the precursor of 'The Rosciad.' He"
4941,ROBERT LLOYD.,"wrote for periodicals, produced some theatrical pieces of no great"
4942,ROBERT LLOYD.,"merit, and edited the _St James' Magazine_. This failed, and Lloyd,"
4943,ROBERT LLOYD.,"involved in pecuniary distresses, was cast into the Fleet. Here he was"
4944,ROBERT LLOYD.,"deserted by all his boon companions except Churchill, to whose sister he"
4945,ROBERT LLOYD.,"was attached, and who allowed him a guinea a-week and a servant, besides"
4946,ROBERT LLOYD.,promoting a subscription for his benefit. When the news of Churchill's
4947,ROBERT LLOYD.,"death arrived, Lloyd was seated at dinner; he became instantly sick,"
4948,ROBERT LLOYD.,"cried out 'Poor Charles! I shall follow him soon,' and died in a few"
4949,ROBERT LLOYD.,"weeks. Churchill's sister, a woman of excellent abilities, waited on"
4950,ROBERT LLOYD.,"Lloyd during his illness, and died soon after him of a broken heart."
4951,ROBERT LLOYD.,This was in 1764.
4952,ROBERT LLOYD.,
4953,ROBERT LLOYD.,"Lloyd was a minor Churchill. He had not his brawny force, but he had"
4954,ROBERT LLOYD.,"more than his liveliness of wit, and was a much better-conditioned man,"
4955,ROBERT LLOYD.,"and more temperate in his satire. Cowper knew, loved, admired, and in"
4956,ROBERT LLOYD.,"some of his verses imitated, Robert Lloyd."

5076,DAVID MALLETT.,
5077,DAVID MALLETT.,"David Mallett was the son of a small innkeeper in Crieff, Perthshire,"
5078,DAVID MALLETT.,"where he was born in the year 1700. Crieff, as many of our readers know,"
5079,DAVID MALLETT.,"is situated on the western side of a hill, and commands a most varied and"
5080,DAVID MALLETT.,"beautiful prospect, including Drummond Castle, with its solemn shadowy"
5081,DAVID MALLETT.,"woods, and the Ochils, on the south,--Ochtertyre, one of the loveliest"
5082,DAVID MALLETT.,"spots in Scotland, and the gorge of Glenturrett, on the north,--and the"
5083,DAVID MALLETT.,"bold dark hills which surround the romantic village of Comrie, on the"
5084,DAVID MALLETT.,"west. Crieff is now a place of considerable note, and forms a centre"
5085,DAVID MALLETT.,of summer attraction to multitudes; but at the commencement of the
5086,DAVID MALLETT.,eighteenth century it must have been a miserable hamlet. _Malloch_ was
5087,DAVID MALLETT.,"originally the name of the poet, and the name is still common in that"
5088,DAVID MALLETT.,"part of Perthshire. David attended the college of Aberdeen, and became,"
5089,DAVID MALLETT.,"afterwards, an unsalaried tutor in the family of Mr Home of Dreghorn,"
5090,DAVID MALLETT.,"near Edinburgh. We find him next in the Duke of Montrose's family, with"
5091,DAVID MALLETT.,"a salary of £30 per annum. In 1723, he accompanied his pupils to London,"
5092,DAVID MALLETT.,"and changed his name to Mallett, as more euphonious. Next year, he"
5093,DAVID MALLETT.,"produced his pretty ballad of 'William and Margaret,' and published it"
5094,DAVID MALLETT.,in Aaron Hill's 'Plain Dealer.' This served as an introduction to the
5095,DAVID MALLETT.,"literary society of the metropolis, including such names as Young and"
5096,DAVID MALLETT.,"Pope. In 1733, he disgraced himself by a satire on the greatest man then"
5097,DAVID MALLETT.,"living, the venerable Richard Bentley. Mallett was one of those mean"
5098,DAVID MALLETT.,"creatures who always worship a rising, and turn their backs on a setting"
5099,DAVID MALLETT.,"sun. By his very considerable talents, his management, and his address,"
5100,DAVID MALLETT.,he soon rose in the world. He was appointed under-secretary to the Prince
5101,DAVID MALLETT.,"of Wales, with a salary of £200 a-year. In conjunction with Thomson, to"
5102,DAVID MALLETT.,"whom he was really kind, he wrote in 1740, 'The Masque of Alfred,' in"
5103,DAVID MALLETT.,"honour of the birthday of the Princess Augusta. His first wife, of whom"
5104,DAVID MALLETT.,"nothing is recorded, having died, he married the daughter of Lord"
5105,DAVID MALLETT.,"Carlisle's steward, who brought him a fortune of £10,000. Both she and"
5106,DAVID MALLETT.,Mallett himself gave themselves out as Deists. This was partly owing to
5107,DAVID MALLETT.,"his intimacy with Bolingbroke, to gratify whom, he heaped abuse upon Pope"
5108,DAVID MALLETT.,"in a preface to 'The Patriot-King,' and was rewarded by Bolingbroke"
5109,DAVID MALLETT.,leaving him the whole of his works and MSS. These he afterwards
5110,DAVID MALLETT.,"published, and exposed himself to the vengeful sarcasm of Johnson, who"
5111,DAVID MALLETT.,"said that Bolingbroke was a scoundrel and a coward;--a scoundrel, to"
5112,DAVID MALLETT.,"charge a blunderbuss against Christianity; and a coward, because he durst"
5113,DAVID MALLETT.,"not fire it himself, but left a shilling to a beggarly Scotsman to draw"
5114,DAVID MALLETT.,the trigger after his death. Mallett ranked himself among the
5115,DAVID MALLETT.,"calumniators and, as it proved, murderers of Admiral Byng. He wrote a"
5116,DAVID MALLETT.,"Life of Lord Bacon, in which, it was said, he forgot that Bacon was a"
5117,DAVID MALLETT.,"philosopher, and would probably, when he came to write the Life of"
5118,DAVID MALLETT.,"Marlborough, forget that he was a general. This Life of Bacon is now"
5119,DAVID MALLETT.,"utterly forgotten. We happened to read it in our early days, and thought"
5120,DAVID MALLETT.,it a very contemptible performance. The Duchess of Marlborough left £1000
5121,DAVID MALLETT.,in her will between Glover and Mallett to write a Life of her husband.
5122,DAVID MALLETT.,"Glover threw up his share of the work, and Mallett engaged to perform the"
5123,DAVID MALLETT.,"whole, to which, besides, he was stimulated by a pension from the second"
5124,DAVID MALLETT.,"Duke of Marlborough. He got the money, but when he died it was found that"
5125,DAVID MALLETT.,he had not written a line of the work. In his latter days he held the
5126,DAVID MALLETT.,lucrative office of Keeper of the Book of Entries for the port of London.
5127,DAVID MALLETT.,He died on the 2lst April 1765.
5128,DAVID MALLETT.,
5129,DAVID MALLETT.,"Mallett is, on the whole, no credit to Scotland. He was a bad, mean,"
5130,DAVID MALLETT.,"insincere, and unprincipled man, whose success was procured by despicable"
5131,DAVID MALLETT.,"and dastardly arts. He had doubtless some genius, and his 'Birks of"
5132,DAVID MALLETT.,"Invermay,' and 'William and Margaret,' shall preserve his name after his"
5133,DAVID MALLETT.,"clumsy imitation of Thomson, called 'The Excursion,' and his long,"
5134,DAVID MALLETT.,rambling 'Amyntor and Theodora;' have been forgotten.

5278,THE CHAMELEON.,"Two travellers of such a cast,"
5279,THE CHAMELEON.,"As o'er Arabia's wilds they passed,"
5280,THE CHAMELEON.,"And on their way, in friendly chat,"
5281,THE CHAMELEON.,"Now talked of this, and then of that;"
5282,THE CHAMELEON.,"Discoursed a while, 'mongst other matter,"
5283,THE CHAMELEON.,Of the chameleon's form and nature.
5284,THE CHAMELEON.,"'A stranger animal,' cries one,"
5285,THE CHAMELEON.,'Sure never lived beneath the sun:
5286,THE CHAMELEON.,"A lizard's body lean and long,"
5287,THE CHAMELEON.,"A fish's head, a serpent's tongue,"
5288,THE CHAMELEON.,Its foot with triple claw disjoined;
5289,THE CHAMELEON.,And what a length of tail behind!
5290,THE CHAMELEON.,How slow its pace! and then its hue--
5291,THE CHAMELEON.,Who ever saw so fine a blue?'
5292,THE CHAMELEON.,
5293,THE CHAMELEON.,"'Hold there,' the other quick replies,"
5294,THE CHAMELEON.,"''Tis green, I saw it with these eyes,"
5295,THE CHAMELEON.,"As late with open mouth it lay,"
5296,THE CHAMELEON.,And warmed it in the sunny ray;
5297,THE CHAMELEON.,"Stretched at its ease the beast I viewed,"
5298,THE CHAMELEON.,And saw it eat the air for food.'
5299,THE CHAMELEON.,
5300,THE CHAMELEON.,"'I've seen it, sir, as well as you,"
5301,THE CHAMELEON.,And must again affirm it blue;
5302,THE CHAMELEON.,At leisure I the beast surveyed

5305,THE CHAMELEON.,"''Tis green, 'tis green, sir, I assure ye.'"

5309,THE CHAMELEON.,"'For if they always serve you thus,"
5310,THE CHAMELEON.,You'll find them but of little use.'
5311,THE CHAMELEON.,
5312,THE CHAMELEON.,"So high at last the contest rose,"
5313,THE CHAMELEON.,From words they almost came to blows:
5314,THE CHAMELEON.,When luckily came by a third;
5315,THE CHAMELEON.,To him the question they referred:
5316,THE CHAMELEON.,"And begged he'd tell them, if he knew,"

5350,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5351,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5352,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"This writer possessed some true imagination, although his claim to"
5353,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,immortality lies in the narrow compass of one poem--his 'Ode to
5354,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Solitude.' Little is known of his personal history. He was born in 1721
5355,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"--belonging to a gentleman's family in Cumberland. He studied medicine,"
5356,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and was for some time a surgeon connected with the army. When the peace
5357,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"came, he established himself in London as a medical practitioner. In"
5358,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"1755, he published his 'Solitude,' which found many admirers, including"
5359,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Dr Johnson, who pronounced its opening lines 'very noble.' He afterwards"
5360,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"indited several other pieces, wrote a translation of Tibullus, and"
5361,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"became one of the critical staff of the _Monthly Review_. He was unable,"
5362,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"however, through all these labours to secure a competence, and, in 1759,"
5363,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,he sought the West Indies. In St Christopher's he commenced practising
5364,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"as a physician, and married the Governor's daughter, who brought him a"
5365,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,fortune. He wrote a poem entitled 'The Sugar-cane.' This was sent over
5366,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"to London in MS., and was read at Sir Joshua Reynold's table to a"
5367,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"literary coterie, who, according to Boswell, all burst out into a laugh"
5368,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"when, after much blank-verse pomp, the poet began a new paragraph thus--"
5369,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5370,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Now, Muse, let's sing of _rats_!"
5371,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5372,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"And what increased the ridicule was, that one of the company, slily"
5373,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"overlooking the reader, found that the word had been originally 'mice,'"
5374,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,but had been changed to rats as more dignified.
5375,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5376,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Boswell goes on to record Johnson's opinion of Grainger. He said, 'He"
5377,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"was an agreeable man, a man that would do any good that was in his"
5378,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"power.' His translation of Tibullus was very well done, but 'The Sugar-"
5379,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"cane, a Poem,' did not please him. 'What could he make of a Sugar-cane?"
5380,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"one might as well write ""The Parsley-bed, a Poem,"" or ""The Cabbage"
5381,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Garden, a Poem.""' Boswell--'You must then _pickle_ your cabbage with the"
5382,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,_sal Atticum_.' Johnson--'One could say a great deal about cabbage. The
5383,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,poem might begin with the advantages of civilised society over a rude
5384,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"state, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no cabbages till Oliver"
5385,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"Cromwell's soldiers introduced them, and one might thus shew how arts"
5386,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"are propagated by conquest, as they were by the Roman arms.' Cabbage, by"
5387,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"the way, in a metaphorical sense, might furnish a very good subject for"
5388,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,a literary _satire_.
5389,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5390,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Grainger died of the fever of the country in 1767. Bishop Percy
5391,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"corroborates Johnson's character of him as a man. He says, 'He was not"
5392,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"only a man of genius and learning, but had many excellent virtues, being"
5393,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"one of the most generous, friendly, benevolent men I ever knew.'"
5394,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5395,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Grainger in some points reminds us of Dyer. Dyer staked his reputation
5396,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"on 'The Fleece;' but it is his lesser poem, 'Grongar Hill,' which"
5397,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,preserves his name; that fine effusion has survived the laboured work.
5398,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,And so Grainger's 'Solitude' has supplanted the stately 'Sugar-cane.'
5399,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,The scenery of the West Indies had to wait till its real poet appeared
5400,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,in the author of 'Paul and Virginia.' Grainger was hardly able to cope
5401,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"with the strange and gorgeous contrasts it presents of cliffs and crags,"
5402,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"like those of Iceland, with vegetation rich as that of the fairest parts"
5403,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"of India, and of splendid sunshine, with tempests of such tremendous"
5404,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"fury that, but for their brief continuance, no property could be secure,"
5405,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and no life could be safe.
5406,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5407,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"The commencement of the 'Ode to Solitude' is fine, but the closing part"
5408,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,becomes tedious. In the middle of the poem there is a tumult of
5409,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"personifications, some of them felicitous and others forced."
5410,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,
5411,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Sage Reflection, bent with years,'"
5412,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"may pass, but"
5413,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Conscious Virtue, void of fears,'"
5414,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is poor.
5415,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Halcyon Peace on moss reclined,'"
5416,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is a picture;
5417,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Retrospect that scans the mind,'"
5418,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is nothing;
5419,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Health that snuffs the morning air,'"
5420,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,is a living image; but what sense is there in
5421,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Full-eyed Truth, with bosom bare?'"
5422,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and how poor his
5423,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Laughter in loud peals that breaks,'"
5424,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,to Milton's
5425,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'Laughter, holding both his sides!'"
5426,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"The paragraph, however, commencing"
5427,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'With you roses brighter bloom,'"
5428,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,and closing with
5429,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"'The bournless macrocosm's thine,'"
5430,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,"is very spirited, and, along with the opening lines, proves"
5431,DR JAMES GRAINGER.,Grainger a poet.

5563,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5564,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5565,MICHAEL BRUCE.,We refer our readers to Dr Mackelvie's well-known and very able Life of
5566,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"poor Bruce, for his full story, and for the evidence on which his claim"
5567,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"to the 'Cuckoo' is rested. Apart from external evidence, we think that"
5568,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"poem more characteristic of Bruce's genius than of Logan's, and have"
5569,MICHAEL BRUCE.,therefore ranked it under Bruce's name.
5570,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5571,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Bruce was born on the 27th of March 1746, at Kinnesswood, parish of"
5572,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Portmoak, county of Kinross. His father was a weaver, and Michael was"
5573,MICHAEL BRUCE.,the fifth of a family of eight children.
5574,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5575,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Poor as his parents were, they were intelligent, religious, and most"
5576,MICHAEL BRUCE.,conscientious in the discharge of their duties to their children. In the
5577,MICHAEL BRUCE.,summer months Michael was sent out to herd cattle; and one loves to
5578,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"imagine the young poet wrapt in his plaid, under a whin-bush, while the"
5579,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"storm was blowing,--or gazing at the rainbow from the summit of a"
5580,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"fence,--or admiring at Lochleven and its old ruined castle,--or weaving"
5581,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"around the form of some little maiden, herding in a neighbouring field"
5582,MICHAEL BRUCE.,--some 'Jeanie Morrison'--one of those webs of romantic early love which
5583,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"are beautiful and evanescent as the gossamer, but how exquisitely"
5584,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"relished while they last! Say not, with one of his biographers, that his"
5585,MICHAEL BRUCE.,'education was retarded by this employment;' he was receiving in these
5586,MICHAEL BRUCE.,solitary fields a kind of education which no school and no college could
5587,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"furnish; nay, who knows but, as he saw the cuckoo winging her way from"
5588,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"one deep woodland recess to another, or heard her dull, divine monotone"
5589,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"coming from the heart of the forest, the germ of that exquisite strain,"
5590,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'least in the kingdom' of the heaven of poetry in size, but immortal in"
5591,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"its smallness, was sown in his mind? In winter he went to school, and"
5592,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"profited there so much, that at fifteen (not a very early period, after"
5593,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"all, for a Scotch student beginning his curriculum--in our day twelve"
5594,MICHAEL BRUCE.,was not an uncommon age) he was judged fit for going to college. And
5595,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"just in time a windfall came across the path of our poet, the mention of"
5596,MICHAEL BRUCE.,which may make many of our readers smile. This was a legacy which was
5597,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"left his father by a relative, amounting to 200 merks, or £11, 2s.6d."
5598,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"With this munificent sum in his pocket, Bruce was sent to study at"
5599,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Edinburgh College. Here he became distinguished by his attainments, and"
5600,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"particularly his taste and poetic powers; and here, too, he became"
5601,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"acquainted with John Logan, afterwards his biographer. After spending"
5602,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"three sessions at college, supported by his parents and other friends,"
5603,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"he returned to the country, and taught a school at Gairney Bridge (a"
5604,MICHAEL BRUCE.,place famous for the first meeting of the first presbytery of the
5605,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Seceders) for £11 of salary. Thence he removed to Foresthill, near"
5606,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Alloa, where a damp school-room, poverty, and hard labour in teaching,"
5607,MICHAEL BRUCE.,united to injure his health and depress his spirits. At Foresthill he
5608,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"wrote his poem 'Lochleven,' which discovers no small descriptive power."
5609,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Consumption began now to make its appearance, and he returned to the"
5610,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"cottage of his parents, where he wrote his 'Elegy on Spring,' in which"
5611,MICHAEL BRUCE.,he refers with dignified pathos to his approaching dissolution. On the
5612,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"5th of July 1767, this remarkable youth died, aged twenty-one years and"
5613,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"three months. His Bible was found on his pillow, marked at the words,"
5614,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Jer. xxii. 10, 'Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep"
5615,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his"
5616,MICHAEL BRUCE.,native country.'
5617,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5618,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Lord Craig wrote some time afterwards an affecting paper in the _Mirror_,"
5619,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"recording the fate, and commending the genius of Bruce. John Logan, in"
5620,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"1770, published his poems. In the year 1807, the kind-hearted Principal"
5621,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Baird published an edition of the poems for the behoof of Bruce's mother,"
5622,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"then an aged widow. And in 1837, Dr William Mackelvie, Balgedie, Kinross-"
5623,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"shire, published what may be considered the standard Life of this poet,"
5624,MICHAEL BRUCE.,along with a complete edition of his Works.
5625,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5626,MICHAEL BRUCE.,It is impossible from so small a segment of a circle as Bruce's life
5627,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"describes, to infer with any certainty the whole. So far as we can judge"
5628,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"from the fragments left, his power was rather in the beautiful, than in"
5629,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"the sublime or in the strong. The lines on Spring, from the words 'Now"
5630,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"spring returns' to the close, form a continuous stream of pensive"
5631,MICHAEL BRUCE.,loveliness. How sweetly he sings in the shadow of death! Nor let us too
5632,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"severely blame his allusion to the old Pagan mythology, in the words--"
5633,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5634,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'I hear the helpless wail, the shriek of woe,"
5635,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"I see the muddy wave, the dreary shore;'"
5636,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5637,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"remembering that he was still a mere student, and not recovered from"
5638,MICHAEL BRUCE.,that fine intoxication in which classical literature drenches a young
5639,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"imaginative soul, and that at last we find him 'resting in the hopes of"
5640,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"an eternal day.' 'Lochleven' is the spent echo of the 'Seasons,' although,"
5641,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"as we said before, its descriptions possess considerable merit. His 'Last"
5642,MICHAEL BRUCE.,Day' is more ambitious than successful. If we grant the 'Cuckoo' to be
5643,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"his, as we are inclined decidedly to do, it is a sure title to fame,"
5644,MICHAEL BRUCE.,being one of the sweetest little poems in any language. Shakspeare would
5645,MICHAEL BRUCE.,have been proud of the verse--
5646,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5647,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'Sweet bird! thy bower is ever green,"
5648,MICHAEL BRUCE.,Thy sky is ever clear;
5649,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,"
5650,MICHAEL BRUCE.,No winter in thy year.'
5651,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5652,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Bruce has not, however, it has always appeared to us, caught so well as"
5653,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"Wordsworth the differentia of the cuckoo,--its invisible, shadowy,"
5654,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"shifting, supernatural character--heard, but seldom seen--its note so"
5655,MICHAEL BRUCE.,limited and almost unearthly:--
5656,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5657,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"'O Cuckoo, shall I call thee bird,"
5658,MICHAEL BRUCE.,Or but a _wandering voice_?'
5659,MICHAEL BRUCE.,
5660,MICHAEL BRUCE.,How fine this conception of a separated voice--'The viewless spirit of a
5661,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"_lonely_ sound,' plaining in the woods as if seeking for some incarnation"
5662,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"it cannot find, and saddening the spring groves by a note so contradictory"
5663,MICHAEL BRUCE.,to the genius of the season. In reference to the note of the cuckoo we
5664,MICHAEL BRUCE.,find the following remarks among the fragments from the commonplace-book
5665,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"of Dr Thomas Brown, printed by Dr Welsh:--'The name of the cuckoo has"
5666,MICHAEL BRUCE.,generally been considered as a very pure instance of imitative harmony.
5667,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"But in giving that name, we have most unjustly defrauded the poor bird of"
5668,MICHAEL BRUCE.,a portion of its very small variety of sound. The second syllable is not
5669,MICHAEL BRUCE.,"a mere echo of the first; it is the sound reversed, like the reading of"
5670,MICHAEL BRUCE.,a sotadic line; and to preserve the strictness of the imitation we should
5671,MICHAEL BRUCE.,give it the name of Ook-koo.' _This_ is the prose of the cuckoo after its
5672,MICHAEL BRUCE.,poetry.

5833,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,CHRISTOPHER SMART.
5834,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5835,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5836,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,We hear of 'Single-speech Hamilton.' We have now to say something of
5837,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'Single-poem Smart,' the author of one of the grandest bursts of"
5838,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,devotional and poetical feeling in the English language--the 'Song to
5839,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"David.' This poor unfortunate was born at Shipbourne, Kent, in 1722."
5840,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"His father was steward to Lord Barnard, who, after his death, continued"
5841,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"his patronage to the son, who was then eleven years of age. The Duchess"
5842,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of Cleveland, through Lord Barnard's influence, bestowed on Christopher"
5843,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"an allowance of £40 a-year. With this he went to Pembroke Hall, Cam-"
5844,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"bridge, in 1739; was in 1745 elected a Fellow of Pembroke, and in 1747"
5845,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"took his degree of M.A. At college, Smart began to display that reckless"
5846,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,dissipation which led afterwards to such melancholy consequences. He
5847,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"studied hard, however, at intervals; wrote poetry both in Latin and"
5848,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"English; produced a comedy called a 'Trip to Cambridge; or, The Grateful"
5849,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Fair,' which was acted in the hall of Pembroke College; and, in spite of"
5850,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"his vices and follies, was popular on account of his agreeable manners"
5851,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"and amiable dispositions. Having become acquainted with Newberry,"
5852,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the benevolent, red-nosed bookseller commemorated in 'The Vicar of"
5853,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Wakefield,'--for whom he wrote some trifles,--he married his step-"
5854,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"daughter, Miss Carnan, in the year 1753. He now removed to London, and"
5855,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"became an author to trade. He wrote a clever satire, entitled 'The"
5856,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Hilliad,' against Sir John Hill, who had attacked him in an underhand"
5857,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"manner. He translated the fables of Phaedrus into verse,--Horace into"
5858,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"prose ('Smart's Horace' used to be a great favourite, under the rose,"
5859,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,with schoolboys); made an indifferent version of the Psalms and
5860,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Paraphrases, and a good one, at a former period, of Pope's 'Ode on St"
5861,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Cecilia's Day,' with which that poet professed himself highly pleased."
5862,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,He was employed on a monthly publication called _The Universal Visitor_.
5863,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,We find Johnson giving the following account of this matter in Boswell's
5864,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Life:--'Old Gardner, the bookseller, employed Rolt and Smart to write a"
5865,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,monthly miscellany called _The Universal Visitor_.' There was a formal
5866,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"written contract. They were bound to write nothing else,--they were to"
5867,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"have, I think, a third of the profits of the sixpenny pamphlet, and the"
5868,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,contract was for ninety-nine years. I wrote for some months in _The
5869,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Universal Visitor_ for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing"
5870,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the terms on which he was engaged to write, and thinking I was doing him"
5871,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"good. I hoped his wits would soon return to him. Mine returned to me, and"
5872,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,I wrote in _The Universal Visitor_ no longer.'
5873,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5874,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,Smart at last was called to pay the penalty of his blended labour and
5875,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,dissipation. In 1763 he was shut up in a madhouse. His derangement had
5876,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,exhibited itself in a religious way: he insisted upon people kneeling
5877,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"down along with him in the street and praying. During his confinement,"
5878,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"writing materials were denied him, and he used to write his poetical"
5879,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"pieces with a key on the wainscot. Thus, 'scrabbling,' like his own hero,"
5880,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"on the wall, he produced his immortal 'Song to David.' He became by and"
5881,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"by sane; but, returning to his old habits, got into debt, and died in the"
5882,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"King's Bench prison, after a short illness, in 1770."
5883,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5884,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,The 'Song to David' has been well called one of the greatest curiosities
5885,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of literature. It ranks in this point with the tragedies written by Lee,"
5886,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,and the sermons and prayers uttered by Hall in a similar melancholy state
5887,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of mind. In these cases, as well as in Smart's, the thin partition"
5888,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"between genius and madness was broken down in thunder,--the thunder of a"
5889,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,higher poetry than perhaps they were capable of even conceiving in their
5890,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"saner moments. Lee produced in that state--which was, indeed, nearly his"
5891,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"normal one--some glorious extravagancies. Hall's sermons, monologised"
5892,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"and overheard in the madhouse, are said to have transcended all that he"
5893,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"preached in his healthier moods. And, assuredly, the other poems by Smart"
5894,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,scarcely furnish a point of comparison with the towering and sustained
5895,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,loftiness of some parts of the 'Song to David.' Nor is it loftiness
5896,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"alone,--although the last three stanzas are absolute inspiration, and"
5897,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,you see the waters of Castalia tossed by a heavenly wind to the very
5898,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"summit of Parnassus,--but there are innumerable exquisite beauties and"
5899,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"subtleties, dropt as if by the hand of rich haste, in every corner of"
5900,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the poem. Witness his description of David's muse, as a"
5901,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5902,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'Blest light, still gaining on the gloom,"
5903,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"The more _than Michal of his bloom_,"

5914,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"''Twas then his thoughts self-conquest pruned,"
5915,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"And heavenly melancholy tuned,"
5916,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,To bless and bear the rest.'
5917,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5918,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,One of David's themes--
5919,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5920,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'The multitudinous abyss,"
5921,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Where secrecy remains in bliss,"
5922,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,And wisdom hides her skill.'
5923,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5924,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"And, not to multiply instances to repletion, this stanza about gems--"
5925,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5926,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'Of gems--their virtue and their price,"
5927,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"Which, hid in earth from man's device,"

5932,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,
5933,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,Incoherence and extravagance we find here and there; but it is not the
5934,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"flutter of weakness, it is the fury of power: from the very stumble of"
5935,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"the rushing steed, sparks are kindled. And, even as Baretti, when he"
5936,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"read the _Rambler_, in Italy, thought within himself, If such are the"
5937,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"lighter productions of the English mind, what must be the grander and"
5938,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"sterner efforts of its genius? and formed, consequently, a strong desire"
5939,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"to visit that country; so might he have reasoned, If such poems as"
5940,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"'David' issue from England's very madhouses, what must be the writings"
5941,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of its saner and nobler poetic souls? and thus might he, from the"
5942,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"parallax of a Smart, have been able to rise toward the ideal altitudes"
5943,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"of a Shakspeare or a Milton. Indeed, there are portions of the 'Song to"
5944,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,"David,' which a Milton or a Shakspeare has never surpassed. The blaze of"
5945,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,the meteor often eclipses the light of
5946,CHRISTOPHER SMART.,

6559,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6560,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6561,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,The history of this 'marvellous boy' is familiar to all the readers of
6562,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"English poetry, and requires only a cursory treatment here. Thomas"
6563,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Chatterton was born in Bristol, November 20, 1752. His father, a teacher"
6564,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in the free-school there, had died before his birth, and he was sent to"
6565,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,be educated at a charity-school. He first learned to read from a black-
6566,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"letter Bible. At the age of fourteen, he was put apprentice to an"
6567,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"attorney; a situation which, however uncongenial, left him ample leisure"
6568,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"for pursuing his private studies. In an unlucky hour, some evil genius"
6569,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"seemed to have whispered to this extra-ordinary youth,--'Do not find or"
6570,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"force, but forge thy way to renown; the other paths to the summit of the"
6571,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"hill are worn and common-place; try a new and dangerous course, the"
6572,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"rather as I forewarn thee that thy time is short.' When, accordingly,"
6573,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"the new bridge at Bristol was finished in October 1768, Chatterton sent"
6574,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"to a newspaper a fictitious account of the opening of the old bridge,"
6575,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,alleging in a note that he had found the principal part of the
6576,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,description in an ancient MS. And having thus fairly begun to work the
6577,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"mint of forgery, it was amazing what a number of false coins he threw"
6578,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"off, and with what perfect ease and mastery! Ancient poems, pretending"
6579,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,to have been written four hundred and fifty years before; fragments of
6580,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"sermons on the Holy Spirit, dated from the fifteenth century; accounts"
6581,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,of all the churches of Bristol as they had appeared three hundred years
6582,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,before; with drawings and descriptions of the castle--most of them
6583,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"professing to be drawn from the writings of 'ane gode prieste, Thomas"
6584,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Rowley'--issued in thick succession from this wonderful, and, to use"
6585,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"the Shakspearean word in a twofold sense, 'forgetive' brain. He next"
6586,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"ventured to send to Horace Walpole, who was employed on a History of"
6587,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"British Painters, an account of eminent 'Carvellers and Peyneters,' who,"
6588,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"according to him, once flourished in Bristol. These labours he plied in"
6589,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"secret, and with the utmost enthusiasm. He used to write by the light of"
6590,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"the moon, deeming that there was a special inspiration in the rays of"
6591,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"that planet, and reminding one of poor Nat Lee inditing his insane"
6592,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,tragedies in his asylum under the same weird lustre. On Sabbaths he was
6593,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"wont to stroll away into the country around Bristol, which is very"
6594,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"beautiful, and to draw sketches of those objects which impressed his"
6595,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,imagination. He often lay down on the meadows near St Mary's Redcliffe
6596,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Church, admiring the ancient edifice; and some years ago we saw a"
6597,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"chamber near the summit of that edifice where he used to sit and write,"
6598,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"his 'eye in a fine frenzy rolling,' and where we could imagine him, when"
6599,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"a moonless night fell, composing his wild Runic lays by the light of a"
6600,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,candle burning in a human skull. It was actually in one of the rooms of
6601,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"this church that some ancient chests had been deposited, including one"
6602,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"called the 'Coffre of Mr Canynge,' an eminent merchant in Bristol, who"
6603,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,had rebuilt the church in the reign of Edward IV. This coffer had been
6604,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"broken up by public authority in 1727, and some valuable deeds had been"
6605,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"taken out. Besides these, they contained various MSS., some of which"
6606,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Chatterton's father, whose uncle was sexton of the church, had carried"
6607,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,off and used as covers to the copy-books of his scholars. This furnished
6608,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,a hint to Chatterton's inventive genius. He gave out that among these
6609,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"parchments he had found many productions of Mr Canynge's, and of the"
6610,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"aforesaid Thomas Rowley's, a priest of the fifteenth century, and a"
6611,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,friend of Canynge's. Chatterton had become a contributor to a periodical
6612,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"of the day called _The Town and Country Magazine_, and to it from time"
6613,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,to time he sent these poems. A keen controversy arose as to their
6614,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"genuineness. Horace Walpole shewed some of them, which Chatterton had"
6615,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"sent him, to Gray and Mason, who were deemed, justly, first-rate"
6616,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"authorities on antiquarian matters, and who at once pronounced them"
6617,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"forgeries. It is deeply to be regretted that these men, perceiving, as"
6618,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"they must have done, the great merit of these productions, had not made"
6619,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"more particular inquiries about them, and tried to help and save the"
6620,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"poet. Walpole, to say the least of it, treated him coldly, telling him,"
6621,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"when he had discovered the forgery, to attend to his own business, and"
6622,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"keeping some of his MSS. in his hands, till an indignant letter from the"
6623,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,author compelled him to restore them.
6624,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6625,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,Chatterton now determined to go to London. His three years' apprenticeship
6626,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"had expired, and there was in Bristol no further field for his aspiring"
6627,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"genius. He found instant employment among the booksellers, and procured"
6628,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"an introduction to Beckford, the patriot mayor, who tried to get him"
6629,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,engaged upon the Opposition side in politics. Our capricious and
6630,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"unprincipled poet, however, declared that he was a poor author that could"
6631,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,not write on both sides; and although his leanings were to the popular
6632,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"party, yet on the death of Beckford he addressed a letter to Lord North"
6633,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in support of his administration. He had projected some large works, such"
6634,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"as a History of England and a History of London, and wrote flaming"
6635,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"letters to his mother and sisters about his prospects, enclosing them at"
6636,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,the same time small remittances of money. But his bright hopes were soon
6637,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"overcast. Instead of a prominent political character, he found himself a"
6638,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,mere bookseller's hack. To this his poverty no more than his will would
6639,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"consent, for though that was great it was equalled by his pride. His life"
6640,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in the country had been regular, although his religious principles were"
6641,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"loose; but in town, misery drove him to intemperance, and intemperance,"
6642,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"in its reaction, to remorse and a desperate tampering with the thought,"
6643,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6644,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,'There is one remedy for all.'
6645,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6646,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"At last, after a vain attempt to obtain an appointment as a surgeon's"
6647,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"mate to Africa, he made up his mind to suicide. A guinea had been sent"
6648,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"him by a gentleman, which he declined. Mrs Angel, his landlady, knowing"
6649,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"him to be in want, the day before his death offered him his dinner, but"
6650,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"this also he spurned; and, on the 25th of August 1770, having first"
6651,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"destroyed all his papers, he swallowed arsenic, and was found dead in"
6652,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,his bed.
6653,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6654,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,He was buried in a shell in the burial-place of Shoe-Lane Workhouse.
6655,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,He was aged seventeen years nine months and a few days. Alas for
6656,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6657,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,'The sleepless soul that perished in his pride!'
6658,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,
6659,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Chatterton, had he lived, would, perhaps, have become a powerful poet,"
6660,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,or a powerful character of some kind. But we must now view him chiefly
6661,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,as a prodigy. Some have treated his power as unnatural--resembling a
6662,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"huge hydrocephalic head, the magnitude of which implies disease,"
6663,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"ultimate weakness, and early death. Others maintain that, apart from the"
6664,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"extraordinary elements that undoubtedly characterised Chatterton, and"
6665,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"constituted him a premature and prodigious birth intellectually, there"
6666,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,was also in parts of his poems evidence of a healthy vigour which only
6667,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,needed favourable circumstances to develop into transcendent excellence.
6668,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"Hazlitt, holding with the one of these opinions, cries, 'If Chatterton"
6669,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"had had a great work to do by living, he would have lived!' Others"
6670,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"retort on the critic, 'On the same principle, why did Keats, whom you"
6671,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"rate so high, perish so early?' The question altogether is nugatory,"
6672,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,seeing it can never be settled. Suffice it that these songs and rhymes
6673,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"of Chatterton have great beauties, apart from the age and position of"
6674,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"their author. There may at times be madness, but there is method in it."
6675,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"The flight of the rhapsody is ever upheld by the strength of the wing,"
6676,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"and while the reading discovered is enormous for a boy, the depth of"
6677,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"feeling exhibited is equally extraordinary; and the clear, firm judgment"
6678,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"which did not characterise his conduct, forms the root and the trunk of"
6679,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,much of his poetry. It was said of his eyes that it seemed as if fire
6680,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,"rolled under them; and it rolls still, and shall ever roll, below many"
6681,THOMAS CHATTERTON.,of his verses.

6810,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6811,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"26 With heart brimful of gnawing grief,"
6812,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"He to Sir Charles did go,"

6825,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6826,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"29 Quoth godly Canynge, 'I do weep,"

6881,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,40 'He taught me justice and the laws

6950,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6951,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"54 And now the bell began to toll,"
6952,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And clarions to sound;
6953,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles he heard the horses' feet
6954,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,A-prancing on the ground:
6955,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6956,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,55 And just before the officers
6957,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"His loving wife came in,"
6958,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Weeping unfeigned tears of woe,"
6959,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,With loud and dismal din.

6961,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"56 'Sweet Florence! now, I pray, forbear;"

6965,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6966,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,57 'Sweet Florence! why those briny tears?
6967,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"They wash my soul away,"
6968,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And almost make me wish for life,"

6971,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,58 ''Tis but a journey I shall go

6975,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6976,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"59 Then Florence, faltering in her say,"
6977,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Trembling these words she spoke,--"
6978,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"'Ah, cruel Edward! bloody king!"

6981,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"60 'Ah, sweet Sir Charles! why wilt thou go"

6983,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,The cruel axe that cuts thy neck
6984,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Shall also end my life.'
6985,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6986,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,61 And now the officers came in
6987,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"To bring Sir Charles away,"
6988,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Who turned to his loving wife,"
6989,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And thus to her did say:
6990,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6991,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"62 'I go to life, and not to death;"
6992,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Trust thou in God above,"
6993,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And teach thy sons to fear the Lord,"
6994,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And in their hearts him love:
6995,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
6996,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,63 'Teach them to run the noble race

6999,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Ye officers, lead on.'"
7000,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7001,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"64 Then Florence raved as any mad,"
7002,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And did her tresses tear;--
7003,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"'Oh, stay, my husband, lord, and life!'--"
7004,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles then dropped a tear;--
7005,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7006,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"65 Till tired out with raving loud,"
7007,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,She fell upon the floor:
7008,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Sir Charles exerted all his might,"
7009,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And marched from out the door.
7010,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7011,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"66 Upon a sledge he mounted then,"
7012,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,With looks full brave and sweet;
7013,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Looks that did show no more concern
7014,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Than any in the street.
7015,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7016,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"67 Before him went the council-men,"
7017,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"In scarlet robes and gold,"
7018,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And tassels spangling in the sun,"
7019,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Much glorious to behold:
7020,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7021,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,68 The friars of St Augustine next
7022,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Appeared to the sight,"
7023,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,All clad in homely russet weeds
7024,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Of godly monkish plight:
7025,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7026,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,69 In different parts a godly psalm
7027,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Most sweetly they did chaunt;
7028,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Behind their backs six minstrels came,"
7029,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Who tuned the strong bataunt.
7030,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7031,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,70 Then five-and-twenty archers came;
7032,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Each one the bow did bend,"
7033,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,From rescue of King Henry's friends
7034,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles for to defend.
7035,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7036,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"71 Bold as a lion came Sir Charles,"
7037,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Drawn on a cloth-laid sled
7038,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"By two black steeds, in trappings white,"
7039,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,With plumes upon their head.
7040,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7041,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,72 Behind him five-and-twenty more
7042,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Of archers strong and stout,"
7043,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"With bended bow each one in hand,"
7044,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Marched in goodly rout:
7045,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7046,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"73 Saint James's friars marched next,"
7047,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Each one his part did chaunt;
7048,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Behind their backs six minstrels came
7049,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Who tuned the strong bataunt:
7050,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7051,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"74 Then came the mayor and aldermen,"
7052,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,In cloth of scarlet decked;
7053,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And their attending men, each one"
7054,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Like eastern princes tricked:
7055,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7056,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,75 And after them a multitude
7057,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Of citizens did throng;
7058,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The windows were all full of heads,"
7059,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,As he did pass along.
7060,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7061,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"76 And when he came to the high cross,"
7062,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Sir Charles did turn and say,--"
7063,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"'O Thou that savest man from sin,"
7064,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Wash my soul clean this day!'
7065,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7066,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,77 At the great minster window sat
7067,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The king in mickle state,"
7068,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,To see Charles Bawdin go along
7069,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,To his most welcome fate.
7070,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7071,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,78 Soon as the sledge drew nigh enough
7072,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"That Edward he might hear,"
7073,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The brave Sir Charles he did stand up,"
7074,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And thus his words declare:
7075,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7076,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"79 'Thou seest me, Edward! traitor vile!"
7077,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Exposed to infamy;
7078,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"But be assured, disloyal man!"
7079,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,I'm greater now than thee.
7080,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7081,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"80 'By foul proceedings, murder, blood,"
7082,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Thou wearest now a crown;
7083,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And hast appointed me to die,"
7084,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,By power not thine own.
7085,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7086,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,81 'Thou thinkest I shall die to-day;
7087,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"I have been dead till now,"
7088,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And soon shall live to wear a crown
7089,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,For ever on my brow:
7090,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7091,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"82 'Whilst thou, perhaps, for some few years"
7092,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Shall rule this fickle land,"
7093,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,To let them know how wide the rule
7094,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,'Twixt king and tyrant hand:
7095,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7096,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"83 'Thy power unjust, thou traitor slave!"
7097,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Shall fall on thy own head'----
7098,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,From out of hearing of the king
7099,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Departed then the sled.
7100,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7101,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"84 King Edward's soul rushed to his face,"
7102,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"He turned his head away,"
7103,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And to his brother Gloucester
7104,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,He thus did speak and say:
7105,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7106,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,85 'To him that so much dreaded death
7107,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"No ghastly terrors bring,"
7108,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Behold the man! he spake the truth,"
7109,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,He's greater than a king!'
7110,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7111,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,86 'So let him die!' Duke Richard said;
7112,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,'And may each of our foes
7113,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Bend down their necks to bloody axe,"
7114,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And feed the carrion crows!'
7115,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7116,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,87 And now the horses gently drew
7117,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Sir Charles up the high hill;
7118,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"The axe did glisten in the sun,"
7119,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,His precious blood to spill.
7120,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7121,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"88 Sir Charles did up the scaffold go,"
7122,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,As up a gilded car
7123,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Of victory, by valorous chiefs,"
7124,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Gained in the bloody war:
7125,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7126,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"89 And to the people he did say,--"
7127,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"'Behold, you see me die,"
7128,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"For serving loyally my king,"
7129,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,My king most rightfully.
7130,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7131,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"90 'As long as Edward rules this land,"
7132,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,No quiet you will know;
7133,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Your sons and husbands shall be slain,"
7134,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And brooks with blood shall flow.
7135,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7136,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,91 'You leave your good and lawful king
7137,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,When in adversity;
7138,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"Like me unto the true cause stick,"
7139,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And for the true cause die.'
7140,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7141,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"92 Then he with priests, upon his knees,"
7142,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"A prayer to God did make,"
7143,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Beseeching him unto himself
7144,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,His parting soul to take.
7145,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7146,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"93 Then, kneeling down, he laid his head"
7147,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Most seemly on the block;
7148,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Which from his body fair at once
7149,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,The able headsman stroke:
7150,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7151,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"94 And out the blood began to flow,"
7152,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,And round the scaffold twine;
7153,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And tears, enough to wash't away,"
7154,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Did flow from each man's eyne.
7155,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,
7156,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,95 The bloody axe his body fair
7157,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Into four quarters cut;
7158,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,"And every part, likewise his head,"
7159,BRISTOWE TRAGEDY.,Upon a pole was put.

7641,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lyttelton, 'He is a poet among lords, if not a lord among poets.' He was"
7642,LORD LYTTELTON.,"the son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, of Hagley in Worcestershire, and was"
7643,LORD LYTTELTON.,"born in 1709. He went to Eton and Oxford, where he distinguished himself."
7644,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Having gone the usual grand tour, he entered Parliament, and became an"
7645,LORD LYTTELTON.,opponent of Sir Robert Walpole. He was made secretary to the Prince of
7646,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Wales, and was in this capacity useful to Mallett and Thomson. In 1741,"
7647,LORD LYTTELTON.,"he married Lucy Fortescue, of Devonshire, who died five years afterwards."
7648,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lyttelton grieved sincerely for her, and wrote his affecting 'Monody' on"
7649,LORD LYTTELTON.,"the subject. When his party triumphed, he was created a Lord of the"
7650,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Treasury, and afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a peerage. He"
7651,LORD LYTTELTON.,"employed much of his leisure in literary composition, writing a good"
7652,LORD LYTTELTON.,"little book on the Conversion of St Paul, a laboured History of Henry II.,"
7653,LORD LYTTELTON.,"and some verses, including the stanza in the 'Castle of Indolence'"

7666,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lyttelton himself died August 22, 1773, aged sixty-four. His History is"
7667,LORD LYTTELTON.,"now little read. It took him, it is said, thirty years to write it, and"
7668,LORD LYTTELTON.,he employed another man to point it--a fact recalling what is told of
7669,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Macaulay, that he sent the first volume of his 'History of England' to"
7670,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Lord Jeffrey, who overlooked the punctuation and criticised the style."
7671,LORD LYTTELTON.,"Of a series of Dialogues issued by this writer, Dr Johnson remarked,"

7673,LORD LYTTELTON.,the world had all his life been telling him.' His 'Monody' expresses
7674,LORD LYTTELTON.,"real grief in an artificial style, but has some stanzas as natural in"

7851,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
7852,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,This unfortunate Scottish bard was born in Edinburgh on the 17th (some
7853,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"say the 5th) of October 1751. His father, who had been an accountant to"
7854,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"the British Linen Company's Bank, died early, leaving a widow and four"
7855,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,children. Robert spent six years at the grammar schools of Edinburgh and
7856,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Dundee, went for a short period to Edinburgh College, and then, having"
7857,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"obtained a bursary, to St Andrews, where he continued till his seven-"
7858,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,teenth year. He was at first designed for the ministry of the Scottish
7859,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Church. He distinguished himself at college for his mathematical
7860,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"knowledge, and became a favourite of Dr Wilkie, Professor of Natural"
7861,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Philosophy, on whose death he wrote an elegy. He early discovered a"
7862,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"passion for poetry, and collected materials for a tragedy on the subject"
7863,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"of Sir William Wallace, which he never finished. He once thought of"
7864,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"studying medicine, but had neither patience nor funds for the needful"
7865,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"preliminary studies. He went away to reside with a rich uncle, named"
7866,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"John Forbes, in the north, near Aberdeen. This person, however, and poor"
7867,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Fergusson unfortunately quarrelled; and, after residing some months in"
7868,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his house, he left it in disgust, and with a few shillings in his pocket"
7869,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"proceeded southwards. He travelled on foot, and such was the effect of"
7870,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his vexation and fatigue, that when he reached his mother's house he fell"
7871,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,into a severe fit of illness.
7872,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
7873,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"He became, on his recovery, a copying-clerk in a solicitor's, and"
7874,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"afterwards in a sheriff-clerk's office, and began to contribute to"
7875,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,_Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine_. We remember in boyhood reading some odd
7876,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"volumes of this production, the general matter in which was inconceivably"
7877,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"poor, relieved only by Fergusson's racy little Scottish poems. His"
7878,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"evenings were spent chiefly in the tavern, amidst the gay and dissipated"
7879,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"youth of the metropolis, to whom he was the 'wit, songster, and mimic.'"
7880,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"That his convivial powers were extraordinary, is proved by the fact of"
7881,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"one of his contemporaries, who survived to be a correspondent of Burns,"
7882,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,doubting if even he equalled the fascination of Fergusson's converse.
7883,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Dissipation gradually stole in upon him, in spite of resolutions dictated"
7884,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"by remorse. In 1773, he collected his poems into a volume, which was"
7885,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"warmly received, but brought him, it is believed, little pecuniary"
7886,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"benefit. At last, under the pressure of poverty, toil, and intemperance,"
7887,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his reason gave way, and he was by a stratagem removed to an asylum."
7888,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Here, when he found himself and became aware of his situation, he uttered"
7889,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"a dismal shriek, and cast a wild and startled look around his cell. The"
7890,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,history of his confinement was very similar to that of Nat Lee and
7891,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"Christopher Smart. For instance, a story is told of him which is an exact"
7892,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,duplicate of one recorded of Lee. He was writing by the light of the
7893,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"moon, when a thin cloud crossed its disk. 'Jupiter, snuff the moon,'"
7894,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"roared the impatient poet. The cloud thickened, and entirely darkened the"
7895,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"light. 'Thou stupid god,' he exclaimed, 'thou hast snuffed it out.' By"
7896,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"and by he became calmer, and had some affecting interviews with his"
7897,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"mother and sister. A removal to his mother's house was even contemplated,"
7898,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"but his constitution was exhausted, and on the 16th of October 1774, poor"
7899,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Fergusson breathed his last. It is interesting to know that the New
7900,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Testament was his favourite companion in his cell. A little after his
7901,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"death arrived a letter from an old friend, a Mr Burnet, who had made a"
7902,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"fortune in the East Indies, wishing him to come out to India, and"
7903,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,enclosing a remittance of £100 to defray the expenses of the journey.
7904,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
7905,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Thus in his twenty-fourth year perished Robert Fergusson. He was buried
7906,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"in the Canongate churchyard, where Burns afterwards erected a monument to"
7907,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"his memory, with an inscription which is familiar to most of our readers."
7908,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,
7909,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,Burns in one of his poems attributes to Fergusson 'glorious pairts.' He
7910,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"was certainly a youth of remarkable powers, although 'pairts' rather"
7911,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"than high genius seems to express his calibre, he can hardly be said to"
7912,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"sing, and he never soars. His best poems, such as 'The Farmer's Ingle,'"
7913,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,are just lively daguerreotypes of the life he saw around him--there is
7914,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,nothing ideal or lofty in any of them. His 'ingle-bleeze' burns low
7915,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,compared to that which in 'The Cottar's Saturday Night' springs up aloft
7916,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"to heaven, like the tongue of an altar-fire. He stuffs his poems, too,"
7917,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"with Scotch to a degree which renders them too rich for even, a Scotch-"
7918,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"man's taste, and as repulsive as a haggis to that of an Englishman. On"
7919,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"the whole, Fergusson's best claim to fame arises from the influence he"
7920,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,"exerted on the far higher genius of Burns, who seems, strangely enough,"
7921,ROBERT FERGUSSON.,to have preferred him to Allan Ramsay.

8786,JOHN SCOTT.,
8787,JOHN SCOTT.,
8788,JOHN SCOTT.,This poet is generally known as 'Scott of Amwell.' This arises from the
8789,JOHN SCOTT.,"fact that his father, a draper in Southwark, where John was born in"
8790,JOHN SCOTT.,"1730, retired ten years afterwards to Amwell. He had never been"
8791,JOHN SCOTT.,"inoculated with the small-pox, and such was his dread of the disease,"
8792,JOHN SCOTT.,"and that of his family, that for twenty years, although within twenty"
8793,JOHN SCOTT.,"miles of London, he never visited it. His parents, who belonged to the"
8794,JOHN SCOTT.,"amiable sect of Quakers, sent him to a day-school at Ware, but that too"
8795,JOHN SCOTT.,"he left upon the first alarm of infection. At seventeen, although his"
8796,JOHN SCOTT.,"education was much neglected, he began to relish reading, and was"
8797,JOHN SCOTT.,materially assisted in his studies by a neighbour of the name of
8798,JOHN SCOTT.,"Frogley, a master bricklayer, who, though somewhat illiterate, admired"
8799,JOHN SCOTT.,"poetry. Scott sent his first essays to the _Gentleman's Magazine_, and"
8800,JOHN SCOTT.,"in his thirtieth year published four elegies, which met with a kind"
8801,JOHN SCOTT.,"reception, although Dr Johnson said only of them, 'They are very well,"
8802,JOHN SCOTT.,but such as twenty people might write.' He produced afterwards 'The
8803,JOHN SCOTT.,"Garden,' 'Amwell,' and other poems, besides some rather narrow 'Critical"
8804,JOHN SCOTT.,"Essays on the English Poets.' When thirty-six years of age, he submitted"
8805,JOHN SCOTT.,"to inoculation, and henceforward visited London frequently, and became"
8806,JOHN SCOTT.,"acquainted with Dr Johnson, Sir William Jones, Mrs Montague, and other"
8807,JOHN SCOTT.,"eminent characters. He was a very active promoter of local improvements,"
8808,JOHN SCOTT.,and diligent in cultivating his grounds and garden. He was twice
8809,JOHN SCOTT.,"married, his first wife being a daughter of his friend Frogley. He died"
8810,JOHN SCOTT.,"in 1783, not of that disease which he so 'greatly feared,' but of a"
8811,JOHN SCOTT.,"putrid fever, at Radcliff. One note of his, entitled 'Ode on Hearing the"
8812,JOHN SCOTT.,"Drum,' still reverberates on the ear of poetic readers. Wordsworth has"
8813,JOHN SCOTT.,"imitated it in his 'Andrew Jones.' Sir Walter makes Rachel Geddes say,"
8814,JOHN SCOTT.,"in 'Redgauntlet,' alluding to books of verse, 'Some of our people do"
8815,JOHN SCOTT.,"indeed hold that every writer who is not with us is against us, but"
8816,JOHN SCOTT.,"brother Joshua is mitigated in his opinions, and correspondeth with our"
8817,JOHN SCOTT.,"friend John Scott of Amwell, who hath himself constructed verses well"
8818,JOHN SCOTT.,approved of even in the world.'

8882,ALEXANDER ROSS.,
8883,ALEXANDER ROSS.,
8884,ALEXANDER ROSS.,Of this fine old Scottish poet we regret that we can tell our readers so
8885,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"little. He was born in 1698, became parish schoolmaster at Lochlee in"
8886,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"Angusshire, and published, by the advice of Dr Beattie, in 1768, a"
8887,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"volume entitled 'Helenore; or, The Fortunate Shepherdess: a Pastoral Tale"
8888,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"in the Scottish Dialect; along with a few Songs.' Some of these latter,"
8889,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"such as 'Woo'd, and Married, and a',' became very popular. Beattie loved"
8890,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"the 'good-humoured, social, happy old man,' who was 'passing rich' on"
8891,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"twenty pounds a-year, and wrote in the _Aberdeen Journal_ a poetical"
8892,ALEXANDER ROSS.,letter in the Scotch language to promote the sale of his poem. Ross died
8893,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"in 1784, about eighty-six years old, and is buried in a churchyard at the"
8894,ALEXANDER ROSS.,east end of the loch.
8895,ALEXANDER ROSS.,
8896,ALEXANDER ROSS.,Lochlee is a very solitary and romantic spot. The road to it from the
8897,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"low country, or Howe of the Mearns, conducts us through a winding,"
8898,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"unequal, but very interesting glen, which, after bearing at its foot"
8899,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"many patches of corn, yellowing amidst thick green copsewood and birch"
8900,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"trees, fades and darkens gradually into a stern, woodless, and rocky"
8901,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"defile, which emerges on a solitary loch, lying 'dern and dreary' amidst"
8902,ALEXANDER ROSS.,silent hills. It is one of those lakes which divide the distance between
8903,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"the loch and the tarn, being two miles in length and one in breadth. The"
8904,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"hills, which are stony and savage, sink directly down upon its brink."
8905,ALEXANDER ROSS.,A house or two are all the dwellings in view. The celebrated Thomas
8906,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"Guthrie dearly loves this lake, lives beside it for months at a time,"
8907,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"and is often seen rowing his lonely boat in the midst of it, by sunlight"
8908,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"and by moonlight too. On the west, one bold, sword-like summit, Craig"
8909,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"Macskeldie by name, cuts the air, and relieves the monotony of the other"
8910,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"mountains. Fit rest has Ross found in that calm, rural burying-place,"
8911,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"beside 'the rude forefathers of the hamlet,' with short, sweet, flower-"
8912,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"sprinkled grass covering his dust, the low voice of the lake sounding"
8913,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"a few yards from his cold ear, and a plain gravestone uniting with his"
8914,ALEXANDER ROSS.,"native mountains to form his memorial. 'Fortunate Shepherd,' (shall we"
8915,ALEXANDER ROSS.,call him?) to have obtained a grave so intensely characteristic of a
8916,ALEXANDER ROSS.,Scottish poet!

9006,RICHARD GLOVER.,
9007,RICHARD GLOVER.,
9008,RICHARD GLOVER.,Glover was a man so remarkable as to be thought capable of having written
9009,RICHARD GLOVER.,"the letters of Junius, although no one now almost names his name or reads"
9010,RICHARD GLOVER.,"his poetry. He was the son of a Hamburgh merchant in London, and born"
9011,RICHARD GLOVER.,"(1712) in St Martin's Lane, Cannon Street. He was educated at a private"
9012,RICHARD GLOVER.,"school in Surrey, but being designed for trade, was never sent to a"
9013,RICHARD GLOVER.,"university, yet by his own exertions he became an excellent classical"
9014,RICHARD GLOVER.,"scholar. At sixteen he wrote a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton,"
9015,RICHARD GLOVER.,and at twenty-five produced nine books of his 'Leonidas.' Partly through
9016,RICHARD GLOVER.,"its own merits, partly through its liberal political sentiments, and"
9017,RICHARD GLOVER.,"partly through the influence of Lord Cobham, to whom it was inscribed,"
9018,RICHARD GLOVER.,"and the praise of Fielding and Chatham, it became very popular. In 1739,"
9019,RICHARD GLOVER.,"he produced a poem entitled 'London; or, The Progress of Commerce,' and a"
9020,RICHARD GLOVER.,"spirited ballad entitled 'Admiral Hosier's Ghost,' which we have given,"
9021,RICHARD GLOVER.,both designed to rouse the national spirit against the Spaniards.
9022,RICHARD GLOVER.,
9023,RICHARD GLOVER.,"Glover was a merchant, and very highly esteemed among his commercial"
9024,RICHARD GLOVER.,"brethren, although at one time unfortunate in business. When forced by"
9025,RICHARD GLOVER.,"his failure to seek retirement, he produced a tragedy on the subject of"
9026,RICHARD GLOVER.,"Boadicea, which ran the usual nine nights, although it has long since"
9027,RICHARD GLOVER.,ceased to be acted or read. In his later years his affairs improved; he
9028,RICHARD GLOVER.,"returned again to public life, was elected to Parliament, and approved"
9029,RICHARD GLOVER.,"himself a painstaking and popular M.P. In 1770, he enlarged his"
9030,RICHARD GLOVER.,"'Leonidas' from nine books to twelve, and afterwards wrote a sequel to"
9031,RICHARD GLOVER.,"it, entitled 'The Athenais.' Glover spent his closing years in opulent"
9032,RICHARD GLOVER.,"retirement, enjoying the intimacy and respect of the most eminent men of"
9033,RICHARD GLOVER.,"the day, and died in 1785."
9034,RICHARD GLOVER.,
9035,RICHARD GLOVER.,"'Leonidas' may be called the epic of the eighteenth century, and betrays"
9036,RICHARD GLOVER.,the artificial genius of its age. The poet rises to his flight like a
9037,RICHARD GLOVER.,"heavy heron--not a hawk or eagle. Passages in it are good, but the effect"
9038,RICHARD GLOVER.,"of the whole is dulness. It reminds you of Cowper's 'Homer,' in which all"
9039,RICHARD GLOVER.,"is accurate, but all is cold, and where even the sound of battle lulls"
9040,RICHARD GLOVER.,"to slumber--or of Edwin Atherstone's 'Fall of Nineveh,' where you are"
9041,RICHARD GLOVER.,"fatigued with uniform pomp, and the story struggles and staggers under a"
9042,RICHARD GLOVER.,"load of words. Thomson exclaimed when he heard of the work of Glover, 'He"
9043,RICHARD GLOVER.,"write an epic, who never saw a mountain!' And there was justice in the"
9044,RICHARD GLOVER.,remark. The success of 'Leonidas' was probably one cause of the swarm of
9045,RICHARD GLOVER.,epics which appeared in the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of
9046,RICHARD GLOVER.,"the nineteenth century.--Cottle himself being, according to De Quincey,"
9047,RICHARD GLOVER.,"'the author of four epic poems, _and_ a new kind of blacking.' Their day"
9048,RICHARD GLOVER.,seems now for ever at an end.

9658,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
9659,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
9660,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"This poet was born in Langholm, Dumfriesshire, in 1734. His father was"
9661,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"minister of the parish, but removed to Edinburgh, where William, after"
9662,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"attending the High School, became clerk to a brewery, and ultimately"
9663,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"a partner in the concern. In this he failed, however; and in 1764 he"
9664,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,repaired to London to prosecute literature. Lord Lyttelton became his
9665,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"patron, although he did him so little service in a secular point of"
9666,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"view, that Mickle was fain to accept the situation of corrector to the"
9667,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Clarendon Press at Oxford. Here he published his 'Pollio,' his 'Concubine,'"
9668,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"--a poem in the manner of Spenser, very sweetly and musically written,"
9669,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"which became popular,--and in 1771 the first canto of a translation of"
9670,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the 'Lusiad' of Camoens. This translation, which he completed in 1775,"
9671,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"was published by subscription, and at once increased his fortune and"
9672,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,established his fame. He had resigned his office of corrector of the
9673,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"press, and was residing with Mr Tomkins, a farmer at Foresthill, near"
9674,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Oxford. In 1779, he went out to Portugal as secretary to Commodore"
9675,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Johnstone, and, as the translator of Camoens, was received with much"
9676,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"distinction. On his return with a little money, he married Mr Tomkins'"
9677,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"daughter, who had a little more, and took up his permanent residence at"
9678,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Foresthill, where he died of a short illness in 1788."
9679,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
9680,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"His translation of the 'Lusiad' is understood to be too free and flowery,"
9681,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,and the translator stands in the relation to Camoens which Pope does to
9682,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Homer. 'Cumnor Hall' has suggested to Scott his brilliant romance of
9683,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"'Kenilworth,' and is a garland worthy of being bound up in the beautiful"
9684,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,locks of Amy Robsart for evermore. 'Are ye sure the news is true?' is a
9685,WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"song true to the very soul of Scottish and of general nature, and worthy,"

9895,LORD NUGENT.,"Robert Craggs, afterwards created Lord Nugent, was an Irishman, a younger"
9896,LORD NUGENT.,"son of Michael Nugent, by the daughter of Robert, Lord Trimlestown, and"
9897,LORD NUGENT.,"born in 1709. He was in 1741 elected M.P. for St Mawes, in Cornwall, and"
9898,LORD NUGENT.,became in 1747 comptroller to the Prince of Wales' household. He after-
9899,LORD NUGENT.,"wards made peace with the Court, and received various promotions and"
9900,LORD NUGENT.,"marks of favour besides the peerage. In 1739, he published anonymously"
9901,LORD NUGENT.,a volume of poems possessing considerable merit. He was converted from
9902,LORD NUGENT.,"Popery, and wrote some vigorous verses on the occasion. Unfortunately,"
9903,LORD NUGENT.,"however, he relapsed, and again celebrated the event in a very weak poem,"
9904,LORD NUGENT.,"entitled 'Faith.' He died in 1788. Although a man of decided talent, as"
9905,LORD NUGENT.,"his 'Ode to Mankind' proves, Nugent does not stand very high either in"
9906,LORD NUGENT.,the catalogue of Irish patriots or of 'royal and noble authors.'

10091,JOHN LOGAN.,
10092,JOHN LOGAN.,John Logan was born in the year 1748. He was the son of a farmer at
10093,JOHN LOGAN.,"Soutra, in the parish of Fala, Mid-Lothian. He was educated for the"
10094,JOHN LOGAN.,"church at Edinburgh, where he became intimate with Robertson, afterwards"
10095,JOHN LOGAN.,"the historian. So, at least, Campbell asserts; but he strangely calls him"
10096,JOHN LOGAN.,"a student of the same standing, whereas, in fact, Robertson saw light in"
10097,JOHN LOGAN.,"1721, and had been a settled minister five years before Logan was born."
10098,JOHN LOGAN.,"After finishing his studies, he became tutor in the family of Mr Sinclair"
10099,JOHN LOGAN.,"of Ulbster, and the late well-known Sir John Sinclair was one of his"
10100,JOHN LOGAN.,"pupils. When licensed to preach, Logan became popular, and was in his"
10101,JOHN LOGAN.,"twenty-fifth year appointed one of the ministers of South Leith. In 1781,"
10102,JOHN LOGAN.,"he read in Edinburgh a course of lectures on the Philosophy of History,"
10103,JOHN LOGAN.,"and in 1782, he printed one of them, on the Government of Asia. In the"
10104,JOHN LOGAN.,"same year he published a volume of poems, which were well received. In"
10105,JOHN LOGAN.,"1783, he wrote a tragedy called 'Runnymede,' which was, owing to some"
10106,JOHN LOGAN.,"imagined incendiary matter, prohibited from being acted on the London"

10108,JOHN LOGAN.,"published. This, along with some alleged irregularities of conduct on the"
10109,JOHN LOGAN.,"part of Logan, tended to alienate his flock, and he was induced to retire"
10110,JOHN LOGAN.,"on a small annuity. He betook himself to London, where, in conjunction"
10111,JOHN LOGAN.,"with the Rev. Mr Thomson,--who had left the parish of Monzievaird, in"
10112,JOHN LOGAN.,"Perthshire, owing to a scandal,--he wrote for the _English Review_, and"
10113,JOHN LOGAN.,"was employed to defend Warren Hastings. This he did in an able manner,"
10114,JOHN LOGAN.,"although a well-known story describes him as listening to Sheridan, on"
10115,JOHN LOGAN.,"the Oude case, with intense interest, and exclaiming, after the first"
10116,JOHN LOGAN.,"hour, 'This is mere declamation without proof'--after the next two, 'This"
10117,JOHN LOGAN.,is a man of extraordinary powers'--and ere the close of the matchless
10118,JOHN LOGAN.,"oration, 'Of all the monsters in history, Warren Hastings is the vilest.'"
10119,JOHN LOGAN.,"Logan died in the year 1788, in his lodgings, Marlborough Street. His"
10120,JOHN LOGAN.,"sermons were published shortly after his death, and if parts of them are,"
10121,JOHN LOGAN.,"as is alleged, pilfered from a Swiss divine, (George Joachim Zollikofer,)"
10122,JOHN LOGAN.,"they have not remained exclusively with the thief, since no sermons have"
10123,JOHN LOGAN.,been so often reproduced in Scottish pulpits as the elegant orations
10124,JOHN LOGAN.,issued under the name of Logan.

10126,JOHN LOGAN.,"We have already declined to enter on the controversy about 'The Cuckoo,'"
10127,JOHN LOGAN.,"intimating, however, our belief, founded partly upon Logan's unscrupulous"
10128,JOHN LOGAN.,"character and partly on internal evidence, that it was originally written"
10129,JOHN LOGAN.,"by Bruce, but probably polished to its present perfection by Logan, whose"
10130,JOHN LOGAN.,other writings give us rather the impression of a man of varied
10131,JOHN LOGAN.,"accomplishments and excellent taste, than of deep feeling or original"
10132,JOHN LOGAN.,"genius. If Logan were not the author of 'The Cuckoo,' there was a special"
10133,JOHN LOGAN.,"baseness connected with the fact, that when Burke sought him out in"
10134,JOHN LOGAN.,"Edinburgh, solely from his admiration of that poem, he owned the soft and"
10135,JOHN LOGAN.,"false impeachment, and rolled as a sweet morsel praise from the greatest"
10136,JOHN LOGAN.,"man of the age, which he knew was the rightful due of another."

10530,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.
10531,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
10532,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
10533,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,The amiable Dr Blacklock deserves praise for his character and for his
10534,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"conduct under very peculiar circumstances, much more than for his"
10535,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"poetry. He was born at Annan, where his father was a bricklayer, in"
10536,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"1721. When about six months old, he lost his eyesight by small-pox. His"
10537,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"father used to read to him, especially poetry, and through the kindness"
10538,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,of friends he acquired some knowledge of the Latin tongue. His father
10539,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"having been accidentally killed when Thomas was nineteen, it might"
10540,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"have fared hard with him, but Dr Stevenson, an eminent medical man"
10541,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"in Edinburgh, who had seen some verses composed by the blind youth,"
10542,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"took him to the capital, sent him to college to study divinity, and"
10543,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"encouraged him to write and to publish poetry. His volume, to which"
10544,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"was prefixed an account of the author, by Professor Spence of Oxford,"
10545,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"attracted much attention. Blacklock was licensed to preach in 1759, and"
10546,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"three years afterwards was married to a Miss Johnstone of Dumfries, an"
10547,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"exemplary but plain-looking lady, whose beauty her husband was wont to"
10548,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,praise so warmly that his friends were thankful that his infirmity was
10549,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"never removed, and thought how justly Cupid had been painted blind. He"
10550,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"was even, through the influence of the Earl of Selkirk, appointed to the"
10551,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"parish of Kirkcudbright, but the parishioners opposed his induction on"
10552,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"the plea of his want of sight, and, in consideration of a small annuity,"
10553,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"he withdrew his claims. He finally settled down in Edinburgh, where he"
10554,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,supported himself chiefly by keeping young gentlemen as boarders in his
10555,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,house. His chief amusements were poetry and music. His conduct to (1786)
10556,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,and correspondence with Burns are too well known to require to be
10557,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,noticed at length here. He published a paper of no small merit in the
10558,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"'Encyclopaedia Britannica' on Blindness, and is the author of a work"
10559,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"entitled 'Paraclesis; or, Consolations of Religion,'--which surely none"
10560,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,require more than the blind. He died of a nervous fever on the 7th of
10561,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"July 1791, so far fortunate that he did not live to see the ruin of his"
10562,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,immortal _protégé_.
10563,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
10564,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"Blacklock was a most amiable, genial, and benevolent being. He was"
10565,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"sometimes subject to melancholy--_un_like many of the blind, and one"
10566,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"especially, whom we name not, but who, still living, bears a striking"
10567,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"resemblance to Blacklock in fineness of mind, warmth of heart, and high-"
10568,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"toned piety, but who is cheerful as the day. As to his poetry, it is"
10569,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"undoubtedly wonderful, considering the circumstances of its production,"
10570,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"if not _per se_. Dr Johnson says to Boswell,--'As Blacklock had the"
10571,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"misfortune to be blind, we may be absolutely sure that the passages in"
10572,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,his poems descriptive of visible objects are combinations of what he
10573,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,remembered of the works of other writers who could see. That foolish
10574,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,fellow Spence has laboured to explain philosophically how Blacklock may
10575,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"have done, by his own faculties, what it is impossible he should do. The"
10576,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"solution, as I have given it, is plain. Suppose I know a man to be so"
10577,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"lame that he is absolutely incapable to move himself, and I find him in a"
10578,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"different room from that in which I left him, shall I puzzle myself with"
10579,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"idle conjectures that perhaps his nerves have, by some unknown change,"
10580,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"all at once become effective? No, sir; it is clear how he got into a"
10581,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,different room--he was CARRIED.'
10582,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,
10583,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,Perhaps there is a fallacy in this somewhat dogmatic statement. Perhaps
10584,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,the blind are not so utterly dark but they may have certain dim
10585,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,_simulacra_ of external objects before their eyes and minds. Apart from
10586,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"this, however, Blacklock's poetry endures only from its connexion with"
10587,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"the author's misfortune, and from the fact that through the gloom he"
10588,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,groped greatly to find and give the burning hand of the peasant poet the
10589,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,"squeeze of a kindred spirit,--kindred, we mean, in feeling and heart,"
10590,THOMAS BLACKLOCK.,although very far removed in strength of intellect and genius.

10709,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,Here we find two ladies amicably united in the composition of one of

10711,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"Minto, sister of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto, wrote the first and the"
10712,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"finest of the two versions. Mrs Cockburn, the author of the second, was a"
10713,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"remarkable person. Her maiden name was Alicia Rutherford, and she was the"
10714,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"daughter of Mr Rutherford of Fernilee, in Selkirkshire. She married Mr"
10715,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"Patrick Cockburn, a younger son of Adam Cockburn of Ormiston, Lord"
10716,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,Justice-Clerk of Scotland. She became prominent in the literary circles
10717,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"of Edinburgh, and an intimate friend of David Hume, with whom she carried"
10718,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"on a long and serious correspondence on religious subjects, in which it"
10719,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"is understood the philosopher opened up his whole heart, but which is"
10720,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"unfortunately lost. Mrs Cockburn, who was born in 1714, lived to 1794,"
10721,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,and saw and proclaimed the wonderful promise of Walter Scott. She wrote
10722,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"a great deal, but the 'Flowers of the Forest' is the only one of her"
10723,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"effusions that has been published. A ludicrous story is told of her son,"
10724,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"who was a dissipated youth, returning one night drunk, while a large"
10725,MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN.,"party of _savans_ was assembled in the house, and locking himself up in"

11121,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"go to the Highlands to collect additional pieces. The result was, in"
11122,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"1762, 'Fingal: an Epic Poem;' and, in the next year, 'Temora,' another"
11123,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"epic poem. Their sale was prodigious, and the effect not equalled till,"
11124,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"twenty-four years later, the poems of Burns appeared. He realised £1200"
11125,JAMES MACPHERSON.,by these productions. In 1764 he accompanied Governor Johnston to
11126,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"Pensacola as his secretary, but quarrelled with him, and returned to"
11127,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"London. Here he became a professional pamphleteer, always taking the"
11128,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"ministerial side, and diversifying these labours by publishing a"
11129,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"translation of Homer, in the style of his Ossian, which, as Coleridge"
11130,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"says of another production, was 'damned unanimously.' Our readers are"
11131,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"familiar with his row with Dr Johnson, who, when threatened with"
11132,JAMES MACPHERSON.,personal chastisement for his obstinate and fierce incredulity in the
11133,JAMES MACPHERSON.,"matter of Ossian, thus wrote the author:--"

11151,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"Nothing daunted by this, and a hundred other similar rebuffs; Macpherson,"
11152,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"like Mallett before him, but with twenty times his abilities, pursued"
11153,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"his peculiar course. He was appointed agent for the Nabob of Arcot,"
11154,'SAM. JOHNSON.',and became M.P. for Carnelford. In this way he speedily accumulated a
11155,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"handsome fortune, and in 1789, while still a youngish man, he retired to"
11156,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"his native parish, where he bought the estate of Raitts, and founded a"
11157,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"splendid villa, called Belleville, where, in ease and affluence, he spent"
11158,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"his remaining days. Surviving Johnson, his ablest opponent, by twelve"
11159,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"years, he died on the 17th of February 1796, in the full view of Ossian's"
11160,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"country. One of his daughters became his heir, and another was the first"
11161,'SAM. JOHNSON.',wife of Sir David Brewster. Macpherson in his will ordered that his body
11162,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"should be buried in Westminster Abbey, and left a sum of money to erect a"
11163,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"monument to him near Belleville. He lies, accordingly, in Poets' Corner,"
11164,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"and a marble obelisk to his memory may be seen near Kingussie, in the"
11165,'SAM. JOHNSON.',centre of some trees.

11167,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"There is nothing new that is true, or true that is new, to be said about"
11168,'SAM. JOHNSON.',the questions connected with Ossian's Poems. That Macpherson is the sole
11169,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"author is a theory now as generally abandoned as the other, which held"
11170,'SAM. JOHNSON.',that he was simply a free translator of the old bard. To the real
11171,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"fragments of Ossian, which he found in the Highlands, he acted very much"
11172,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"as he did to the ancient property of Raitts, in his own native parish."
11173,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"This he purchased in its crude state, and beautified into a mountain"
11174,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"paradise. He changed, however, its name into Belleville, and it had been"
11175,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"better if he had behaved in a similar way with the poems, and published"
11176,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"them as, with some little groundwork from another, the veritable writings"
11177,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"of James Macpherson, Esq. The ablest opponent of his living reputation"
11178,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"was, as we said, Johnson; and the ablest enemy of his posthumous fame has"
11179,'SAM. JOHNSON.',been Macaulay. We are at a loss to understand _his_ animosity to the
11180,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"author of Ossian. Were the Macphersons and Macaulays ever at feud, and"
11181,'SAM. JOHNSON.',did the historian lose his great-great-grandmother in some onslaught made
11182,'SAM. JOHNSON.',on the Hebrides by the progenitors of the pseudo-Ossian? Macpherson as
11183,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"a man we respect not, and we are persuaded that the greater part of"
11184,'SAM. JOHNSON.',Ossian's Poems can be traced no further than his teeming brain. Nor are
11185,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"we careful to defend his poetry from the common charges of monotony,"
11186,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"affectation, and fustian. But we deem Macaulay grossly unjust in his"
11187,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"treatment of Macpherson's genius and its results, and can fortify our"
11188,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"judgment by that of Sir Walter Scott and Professor Wilson, two men as far"
11189,'SAM. JOHNSON.',superior to the historian in knowledge of the Highlands and of Highland
11190,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"song, and in genuine poetic taste, as they were confessedly in original"
11191,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"imagination. The former says, 'Macpherson was certainly a man of high"
11192,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"talents, and his poetic powers are honourable to his country.' Wilson, in"
11193,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"an admirable paper in _Blackwood_ for November 1839, while admitting many"
11194,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"faults in Ossian, eloquently proclaims the presence in his strains of"
11195,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"much of the purest, most pathetic, and most sublime poetry, instancing"
11196,'SAM. JOHNSON.',the 'Address to the Sun' as equal to anything in Homer or Milton. Both
11197,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"these great writers have paid Macpherson a higher compliment still,--they"
11198,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"have imitated him, and the speeches of Allan Macaulay (a far greater"
11199,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"genius than his namesake), Ranald MacEagh, and Elspeth MacTavish, in the"
11200,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"'Waverley Novels,' and such, articles by Christopher North as 'Cottages,'"
11201,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"'Hints for the Holidays,' and a 'Glance at Selby's Ornithology,' are all"
11202,'SAM. JOHNSON.',coloured by familiarity and fellow-feeling with Ossian's style. Best of
11203,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"all, the Highlanders as a nation have accepted Ossian as their bard; he"
11204,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"is as much the poet of Morven as Burns of Coila, and it is as hopeless to"
11205,'SAM. JOHNSON.',dislodge the one from the Highland as the other from the Lowland heart.
11206,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"The true way to learn to appreciate Ossian's poetry is not to hurry, as"
11207,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"Macaulay seems to have done, in a steamer from Glasgow to Oban, and"
11208,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"thence to Ballachulish, and thence through Glencoe, (mistaking a fine"
11209,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"lake for a 'sullen pool' on his way, and ignoring altogether its peculiar"
11210,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"features of grandeur,) and thence to Inverness or Edinburgh; but it is to"
11211,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"live for years--as Macpherson did while writing Ossian, and Wilson also"
11212,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"did to some extent--under the shadow of the mountains,--to wander through"
11213,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"lonely moors amidst drenching mists and rains,--to hold trysts with"
11214,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"thunder-storms on the summit of savage hills,--to bathe after nightfall"
11215,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"in dreary tarns,--to lie over the ledge and dip one's fingers in the"
11216,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"spray of cataracts,--to plough a solitary path into the heart of forests,"
11217,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"and to sleep and dream for hours amidst their sunless glades,--to meet"
11218,'SAM. JOHNSON.',on twilight hills the apparition of the winter moon rising over snowy
11219,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"wastes,--to descend by her ghastly light precipices where the eagles"
11220,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"are sleeping,--and, returning home, to be haunted by night-visions of"
11221,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"mightier mountains, wilder desolations, and giddier descents;--experience"
11222,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"somewhat like this is necessary to form a true 'Child of the Mist,' and"
11223,'SAM. JOHNSON.',"to give the full capacity for sharing in or appreciating the shadowy,"

11677,JOHN LOWE.,"The author of 'Mary's Dream' was born in 1750, at Kenmore, Galloway, and"
11678,JOHN LOWE.,"was the son of a gardener. He became a student of divinity, and acted"
11679,JOHN LOWE.,as tutor in the family of a Mr McGhie of Airds. A daughter of Mr McGhie
11680,JOHN LOWE.,"was attached to a gentleman named Miller, a surgeon at sea, and on the"
11681,JOHN LOWE.,"occasion of his death Lowe wrote his beautiful 'Mary's Dream,' the"
11682,JOHN LOWE.,exquisite simplicity and music of the first stanza of which has often
11683,JOHN LOWE.,"been admired. Lowe was betrothed to a sister of 'Mary,' but having"
11684,JOHN LOWE.,"emigrated to America, he married another, fell into dissipated habits,"
11685,JOHN LOWE.,and died in a miserable plight at Fredericksburgh in 1798. He wrote many
11686,JOHN LOWE.,"other pieces, but none equal to 'Mary's Dream.'"

11731,JOSEPH WARTON.,
11732,JOSEPH WARTON.,
11733,JOSEPH WARTON.,This accomplished critic and poet was born in 1722. He was son to the
11734,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Vicar of Basingstoke, and brother to Thomas Warton. (See a former volume"
11735,JOSEPH WARTON.,"for his life.) Joseph was educated at Winchester College, and became"
11736,JOSEPH WARTON.,intimate there with William Collins. He wrote when quite young some
11737,JOSEPH WARTON.,poetry in the _Gentleman's Magazine_. He was in due time removed to Oriel
11738,JOSEPH WARTON.,"College, where he composed two poems, entitled 'The Enthusiast,' and 'The"
11739,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Dying Indian.' In 1744, he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Oxford,"
11740,JOSEPH WARTON.,and was ordained to his father's curacy at Basingstoke. He went thence
11741,JOSEPH WARTON.,"to Chelsea, but did not remain there long, owing to some disagreement"
11742,JOSEPH WARTON.,"with his parishioners, and returned to Basingstoke. In 1746, he published"
11743,JOSEPH WARTON.,"a volume of Odes, and in the preface expressed his hope that it might"
11744,JOSEPH WARTON.,be successful as an attempt to bring poetry back from the didactic and
11745,JOSEPH WARTON.,"satirical taste of the age, to the truer channels of fancy and description."
11746,JOSEPH WARTON.,"The motive of this attempt was, however, more praiseworthy than its success"
11747,JOSEPH WARTON.,was conspicuous.
11748,JOSEPH WARTON.,
11749,JOSEPH WARTON.,"In 1748, Warton was presented by the Duke of Bolton to the rectory of"
11750,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Winslade, and he straightway married a Miss Daman, to whom he had for"
11751,JOSEPH WARTON.,"some time been attached. In the same year he began, and in 1753 he"
11752,JOSEPH WARTON.,"finished and printed, an edition of Virgil in English and Latin. Of this"
11753,JOSEPH WARTON.,"large, elaborate work, Warton himself supplied only the life of Virgil,"
11754,JOSEPH WARTON.,"with three essays on pastoral, didactic, and epic poetry, and a poetical"
11755,JOSEPH WARTON.,"version of the Eclogues and the Georgics, more correct but less spirited"
11756,JOSEPH WARTON.,"than Dryden's. He adopted Pitt's version of the Aeneid, and his friends"
11757,JOSEPH WARTON.,"furnished some of the dissertations, notes, &c. Shortly after, he"
11758,JOSEPH WARTON.,"contributed twenty-four excellent papers, including some striking"
11759,JOSEPH WARTON.,"allegories, and some good criticisms on Shakspeare, to the _Adventurer_."
11760,JOSEPH WARTON.,"In 1754, he was appointed to the living of Tunworth, and the next year"
11761,JOSEPH WARTON.,was elected second master of Winchester School. Soon after this he
11762,JOSEPH WARTON.,"published anonymously 'An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope,'"
11763,JOSEPH WARTON.,"which, whether because he failed in convincing the public that his"
11764,JOSEPH WARTON.,"estimate of Pope was the correct one, or because he stood in awe of"
11765,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Warburton, he did not complete or reprint for twenty-six years. It is a"
11766,JOSEPH WARTON.,"somewhat gossiping book, but full of information and interest."
11767,JOSEPH WARTON.,
11768,JOSEPH WARTON.,"In May 1766, he was made head-master of Winchester. In 1768, he lost his"
11769,JOSEPH WARTON.,"wife, and next year married a Miss Nicholas of Winchester. In 1782, he"
11770,JOSEPH WARTON.,"was promoted, through Bishop Lowth, to a prebend's post in St Paul's, and"
11771,JOSEPH WARTON.,"to the living of Thorley, which he exchanged for that of Wickham. Other"
11772,JOSEPH WARTON.,"livings dropped in upon him, and in 1793 he resigned the mastership of"
11773,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Winchester, and went to reside at Wickham. Here he employed himself in"
11774,JOSEPH WARTON.,"preparing an edition of Pope, which he published in 1797. In 1800 he"
11775,JOSEPH WARTON.,died.
11776,JOSEPH WARTON.,
11777,JOSEPH WARTON.,"Warton, like his brother, did good service in resisting the literary"
11778,JOSEPH WARTON.,"despotism of Pope, and in directing the attention of the public to the"
11779,JOSEPH WARTON.,forgotten treasures of old English poetry. He was a man of extensive
11780,JOSEPH WARTON.,"learning, a very fair and candid, as well as acute critic, and his 'Ode"
11781,JOSEPH WARTON.,to Fancy' proves him to have possessed no ordinary genius.
