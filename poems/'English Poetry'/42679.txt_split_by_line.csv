57,THE DANCING SEAL,THE DANCING SEAL
58,THE DANCING SEAL,
59,THE DANCING SEAL,When we were building Skua Light--
60,THE DANCING SEAL,The first men who had lived a night
61,THE DANCING SEAL,Upon that deep-sea Isle--
62,THE DANCING SEAL,"As soon as chisel touched the stone,"
63,THE DANCING SEAL,The friendly seals would come ashore;
64,THE DANCING SEAL,"And sit and watch us all the while,"
65,THE DANCING SEAL,As though they’d not seen men before;
66,THE DANCING SEAL,"And so, poor beasts, had never known"
67,THE DANCING SEAL,Men had the heart to do them harm.
68,THE DANCING SEAL,They’d little cause to feel alarm
69,THE DANCING SEAL,"With us, for we were glad to find"
70,THE DANCING SEAL,Some friendliness in that strange sea;
71,THE DANCING SEAL,Only too pleased to let them be
72,THE DANCING SEAL,And sit as long as they’d a mind
73,THE DANCING SEAL,To watch us: for their eyes were kind
74,THE DANCING SEAL,"Like women’s eyes, it seemed to me."
75,THE DANCING SEAL,
76,THE DANCING SEAL,"So, hour on hour, they sat: I think"
77,THE DANCING SEAL,They liked to hear the chisels’ clink:
78,THE DANCING SEAL,"And when the boy sang loud and clear,"
79,THE DANCING SEAL,They scrambled closer in to hear;
80,THE DANCING SEAL,"And if he whistled sweet and shrill,"
81,THE DANCING SEAL,The queer beasts shuffled nearer still:
82,THE DANCING SEAL,But every sleek and sheeny skin
83,THE DANCING SEAL,Was mad to hear his violin.
84,THE DANCING SEAL,
85,THE DANCING SEAL,"When, work all over for the day,"
86,THE DANCING SEAL,He’d take his fiddle down and play
87,THE DANCING SEAL,"His merry tunes beside the sea,"
88,THE DANCING SEAL,"Their eyes grew brighter and more bright,"
89,THE DANCING SEAL,And burned and twinkled merrily:
90,THE DANCING SEAL,"And as I watched them one still night,"
91,THE DANCING SEAL,"And saw their eager sparkling eyes,"
92,THE DANCING SEAL,I felt those lively seals would rise
93,THE DANCING SEAL,"Some shiny night ere he could know,"
94,THE DANCING SEAL,"And dance about him, heel and toe,"
95,THE DANCING SEAL,Unto the fiddle’s heady tune.
96,THE DANCING SEAL,
97,THE DANCING SEAL,"And at the rising of the moon,"
98,THE DANCING SEAL,"Half-daft, I took my stand before"
99,THE DANCING SEAL,A young seal lying on the shore;
100,THE DANCING SEAL,And called on her to dance with me.
101,THE DANCING SEAL,And it seemed hardly strange when she
102,THE DANCING SEAL,"Stood up before me suddenly,"
103,THE DANCING SEAL,And shed her black and sheeny skin;
104,THE DANCING SEAL,"And smiled, all eager to begin..."
105,THE DANCING SEAL,"And I was dancing, heel and toe,"
106,THE DANCING SEAL,"With a young maiden white as snow,"
107,THE DANCING SEAL,Unto a crazy violin.
108,THE DANCING SEAL,
109,THE DANCING SEAL,"We danced beneath the dancing moon,"
110,THE DANCING SEAL,"All night, beside the dancing sea,"
111,THE DANCING SEAL,With tripping toes and skipping heels:
112,THE DANCING SEAL,And all about us friendly seals
113,THE DANCING SEAL,Like Christian folk were dancing reels
114,THE DANCING SEAL,Unto the fiddle’s endless tune
115,THE DANCING SEAL,That kept on spinning merrily
116,THE DANCING SEAL,As though it never meant to stop.
117,THE DANCING SEAL,And never once the snow-white maid
118,THE DANCING SEAL,A moment stayed
119,THE DANCING SEAL,"To take a breath,"
120,THE DANCING SEAL,Though I was fit to drop:
121,THE DANCING SEAL,"And while those wild eyes challenged me,"
122,THE DANCING SEAL,I knew as well as well could be
123,THE DANCING SEAL,"I must keep step with that young girl,"
124,THE DANCING SEAL,Though we should dance to death.
125,THE DANCING SEAL,
126,THE DANCING SEAL,Then with a skirl
127,THE DANCING SEAL,The fiddle broke:
128,THE DANCING SEAL,The moon went out:
129,THE DANCING SEAL,The sea stopped dead:
130,THE DANCING SEAL,"And, in a twinkling, all the rout"
131,THE DANCING SEAL,Of dancing folk had fled...
132,THE DANCING SEAL,And in the chill bleak dawn I woke
133,THE DANCING SEAL,"Upon the naked rock, alone."
134,THE DANCING SEAL,
135,THE DANCING SEAL,They’ve brought me far from Skua Isle...
136,THE DANCING SEAL,I laugh to think they do not know
137,THE DANCING SEAL,"That as, all day, I chip the stone,"
138,THE DANCING SEAL,"Among my fellows here inland,"
139,THE DANCING SEAL,I smell the sea-wrack on the shore...
140,THE DANCING SEAL,"And see her snowy-tossing hand,"
141,THE DANCING SEAL,And meet again her merry smile...
142,THE DANCING SEAL,"And dream I’m dancing all the while,"
143,THE DANCING SEAL,"I’m dancing ever, heel and toe,"
144,THE DANCING SEAL,"With a seal-maiden, white as snow,"
145,THE DANCING SEAL,"On that moonshiny Island-strand,"
146,THE DANCING SEAL,For ever and for evermore.
147,THE DANCING SEAL,
148,THE DANCING SEAL,
149,THE DANCING SEAL,
150,THE DANCING SEAL,
151,THE SLAG,THE SLAG
152,THE SLAG,
153,THE SLAG,"Among bleak hills of mounded slag they walked,"
154,THE SLAG,’Neath sullen evening skies that seemed to sag
155,THE SLAG,"O’er-burdened by the belching smoke, and lie"
156,THE SLAG,"Upon their aching foreheads, dense and dank,"
157,THE SLAG,Till both felt youth within them fail and flag--
158,THE SLAG,Even as the flame which shot a fiery rag
159,THE SLAG,A fluttering moment through the murky sky
160,THE SLAG,"Above the black blast-furnaces, then sank"
161,THE SLAG,Again beneath the iron bell close-bound--
162,THE SLAG,And it was all that they could do to drag
163,THE SLAG,"Themselves along, ’neath that dead-weight of smoke,"
164,THE SLAG,"Over the cinder-blasted, barren ground."
165,THE SLAG,"Though fitfully and fretfully she talked,"
166,THE SLAG,"He never turned his eyes to her, or spoke:"
167,THE SLAG,And as he slouched with her along the track
168,THE SLAG,"That skirted a stupendous, lowering mound,"
169,THE SLAG,"With listless eyes, and o’er-strained sinews slack,"
170,THE SLAG,"She bit a petted, puckered lip, and frowned"
171,THE SLAG,To think she ever should be walking out
172,THE SLAG,"With this tongue-tied, slow-witted, hulking lout,"
173,THE SLAG,As cold and dull and lifeless as the slag.
174,THE SLAG,
175,THE SLAG,"And, all on edge, o’erwrought by the crampt day"
176,THE SLAG,"Of crouched, close stitching at her dull machine,"
177,THE SLAG,It seemed to her a girl of seventeen
178,THE SLAG,"Should have, at least, an hour of careless talking--"
179,THE SLAG,"Should have, at least, an hour of life, out walking"
180,THE SLAG,"Beside a lover, mettlesome and gay--"
181,THE SLAG,Not through her too short freedom doomed to lag
182,THE SLAG,"Beside a sparkless giant, glum and grim,"
183,THE SLAG,Till all her eager youth should waste away.
184,THE SLAG,"Yet, even as she looked askance at him--"
185,THE SLAG,"Well-knit, big-thewed, broad-chested, steady-eyed--"
186,THE SLAG,She dimly knew of depths she could not sound
187,THE SLAG,"In this strong lover, silent at her side:"
188,THE SLAG,"And, once again, her heart was touched with pride"
189,THE SLAG,"To think that he was hers, this strapping lad--"
190,THE SLAG,"Black-haired, close-cropt, clean-skinned, and neatly clad..."
191,THE SLAG,"His crimson neckerchief, so smartly tied--"
192,THE SLAG,"And hers alone, and more than all she had"
193,THE SLAG,"In all the world to her ... and yet, so grave!"
194,THE SLAG,If he would only shew that he was glad
195,THE SLAG,"To be with her--a gleam, a spark of fire,"
196,THE SLAG,"A spurt of flame to shoot into the night,"
197,THE SLAG,A moment through the murky heavens to wave
198,THE SLAG,An eager beacon of enkindling light
199,THE SLAG,In answer to her young heart’s quick desire!
200,THE SLAG,
201,THE SLAG,"Yet, though he walked with dreaming eyes agaze,"
202,THE SLAG,"As, deep within a mound of slag, a core"
203,THE SLAG,"Of unseen fire may smoulder many days,"
204,THE SLAG,"Till suddenly the whole heap glow ablaze,"
205,THE SLAG,"That seemed, but now, dead cinder, grey and cold,"
206,THE SLAG,Life smouldered in his heart.  The fire he fed
207,THE SLAG,Day-long in the tall furnace just ahead
208,THE SLAG,From that frail gallery slung against the sky
209,THE SLAG,"Had burned through all his being, till the ore"
210,THE SLAG,Glowed in him.  Though no surface-stream of gold
211,THE SLAG,Quick-molten slag of speech was his to spill
212,THE SLAG,"Unceasingly, the burning metal still"
213,THE SLAG,"Seethed in him, from the broken furnace-side"
214,THE SLAG,To burst at any moment in a tide
215,THE SLAG,Of white-hot molten iron o’er the mould...
216,THE SLAG,
217,THE SLAG,But still he spoke no word as they strolled on
218,THE SLAG,Into the early-gathering Winter night:
219,THE SLAG,"And, as she watched the leaping furnace-light,"
220,THE SLAG,She had no thought of smouldering fires unseen...
221,THE SLAG,The daylong clattering whirr of her machine
222,THE SLAG,Hummed in her ears again--the straining thread
223,THE SLAG,And stabbing needle starting through her head--
224,THE SLAG,Until the last dull gleam of day was gone...
225,THE SLAG,
226,THE SLAG,"When, all at once, upon the right,"
227,THE SLAG,"A crackling crash, a blinding flare..."
228,THE SLAG,A shower of cinders through the air...
229,THE SLAG,A grind of blocks of slag aslide...
230,THE SLAG,"And, far above them, in the night,"
231,THE SLAG,The looming heap had opened wide
232,THE SLAG,"About a fiery, gaping pit..."
233,THE SLAG,"And, startled and aghast at it,"
234,THE SLAG,"With clasping hands they stood astare,"
235,THE SLAG,And gazed upon the awful glare:
236,THE SLAG,"And, as she felt him clutch her hand,"
237,THE SLAG,"She seemed to know her heart’s desire,"
238,THE SLAG,For evermore with him to stand
239,THE SLAG,In that enkindling blaze of fire...
240,THE SLAG,"When, suddenly, he left her side;"
241,THE SLAG,And started scrambling up the heap:
242,THE SLAG,"And, looking up, with stifled cry,"
243,THE SLAG,"She saw, against the glowing sky,"
244,THE SLAG,"Almost upon the pit’s red brink,"
245,THE SLAG,"A little lad, stock-still with fright"
246,THE SLAG,Before the blazing pit of dread
247,THE SLAG,"Agape before him in the night,"
248,THE SLAG,"Where, playing castles on the height"
249,THE SLAG,"Since noon, he’d fallen, spent, asleep"
250,THE SLAG,And dreaming he was home in bed...
251,THE SLAG,
252,THE SLAG,"With brain afire, too strained to think,"
253,THE SLAG,She watched her lover climb and leap
254,THE SLAG,From jag to jag
255,THE SLAG,Of broken slag...
256,THE SLAG,And still he only seemed to creep...
257,THE SLAG,She felt that he would never reach
258,THE SLAG,"That little lad, though he should climb"
259,THE SLAG,Until the very end of time...
260,THE SLAG,"And, as she looked, the burning breach"
261,THE SLAG,Gaped suddenly more wide...
262,THE SLAG,"The slag again began to slide,"
263,THE SLAG,"And crash into the pit,"
264,THE SLAG,Until the dazed lad’s feet
265,THE SLAG,Stood on the edge of it.
266,THE SLAG,She saw him reel and fall...
267,THE SLAG,And thought him done for ... then
268,THE SLAG,"Her lover, brave and tall,"
269,THE SLAG,"Against the glare and heat,"
270,THE SLAG,A very fire-bright god of men!
271,THE SLAG,He stooped ... and now she knew the lad
272,THE SLAG,"Was safe with Robert, after all."
273,THE SLAG,
274,THE SLAG,"And while she watched, a throng of folk"
275,THE SLAG,"Attracted by the crash and flare,"
276,THE SLAG,"Had gathered round, though no one spoke"
277,THE SLAG,"But all stood terror-stricken there,"
278,THE SLAG,"With lifted eyes and indrawn breath,"
279,THE SLAG,Until the lad was snatched from death
280,THE SLAG,"Upon the very pit’s edge, when,"
281,THE SLAG,"As Robert picked him up, and turned,"
282,THE SLAG,A sigh ran through the crowd; and fear
283,THE SLAG,"Gave place to joy, as cheer on cheer"
284,THE SLAG,Sang through the kindled air...
285,THE SLAG,
286,THE SLAG,"But still she never uttered word,"
287,THE SLAG,As though she neither saw nor heard;
288,THE SLAG,"Till as, at last, her lad drew near,"
289,THE SLAG,She saw him bend with tender care
290,THE SLAG,Over the sobbing child who lay
291,THE SLAG,"Safe in his arms, and hug him tight"
292,THE SLAG,Against his breast--his brow alight
293,THE SLAG,"With eager, loving eyes that burned"
294,THE SLAG,In his transfigured face aflame...
295,THE SLAG,And even when the parents came
296,THE SLAG,It almost seemed that he was loth
297,THE SLAG,To yield them up their little son;
298,THE SLAG,As though the lad were his by right
299,THE SLAG,"Of rescue, from the pit’s edge won."
300,THE SLAG,
301,THE SLAG,"Then, as his eyes met hers, she felt"
302,THE SLAG,An answering thrill of tenderness
303,THE SLAG,"Run, quickening, through her breast; and both"
304,THE SLAG,"Stood quivering there, with envious eyes,"
305,THE SLAG,"And stricken with a strange distress,"
306,THE SLAG,As quickly homeward through the night
307,THE SLAG,The happy parents bore their boy...
308,THE SLAG,
309,THE SLAG,"And then, about her reeling bright,"
310,THE SLAG,The whole night seemed to her to melt
311,THE SLAG,"In one fierce, fiery flood of joy."
312,THE SLAG,
313,THE SLAG,
314,THE SLAG,
315,THE SLAG,
316,DEVIL’S EDGE,DEVIL’S EDGE
317,DEVIL’S EDGE,
318,DEVIL’S EDGE,"All night I lay on Devil’s Edge,"
319,DEVIL’S EDGE,Along an overhanging ledge
320,DEVIL’S EDGE,Between the sky and sea:
321,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And as I rested ’waiting sleep,"
322,DEVIL’S EDGE,The windless sky and soundless deep
323,DEVIL’S EDGE,"In one dim, blue infinity"
324,DEVIL’S EDGE,Of starry peace encompassed me.
325,DEVIL’S EDGE,
326,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And I remembered, drowsily,"
327,DEVIL’S EDGE,How ’mid the hills last night I ’d lain
328,DEVIL’S EDGE,Beside a singing moorland burn;
329,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And waked at dawn, to feel the rain"
330,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Fall on my face, as on the fern"
331,DEVIL’S EDGE,That drooped about my heather-bed:
332,DEVIL’S EDGE,And how by noon the wind had blown
333,DEVIL’S EDGE,"The last grey shred from out the sky,"
334,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And blew my homespun jacket dry,"
335,DEVIL’S EDGE,As I stood on the topmost stone
336,DEVIL’S EDGE,"That crowns the cairn on Hawkshaw Head,"
337,DEVIL’S EDGE,And caught a gleam of far-off sea;
338,DEVIL’S EDGE,And heard the wind sing in the bent
339,DEVIL’S EDGE,Like those far waters calling me:
340,DEVIL’S EDGE,"When, my heart answering to the call,"
341,DEVIL’S EDGE,"I followed down the seaward stream,"
342,DEVIL’S EDGE,By silent pool and singing fall;
343,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Till with a quiet, keen content,"
344,DEVIL’S EDGE,"I watched the sun, a crimson ball,"
345,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Shoot through grey seas a fiery gleam,"
346,DEVIL’S EDGE,Then sink in opal deeps from sight.
347,DEVIL’S EDGE,
348,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And with the coming on of night,"
349,DEVIL’S EDGE,"The wind had dropped: and as I lay,"
350,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Retracing all the happy day,"
351,DEVIL’S EDGE,And gazing long and dreamily
352,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Across the dim, unsounding sea,"
353,DEVIL’S EDGE,Over the far horizon came
354,DEVIL’S EDGE,A sudden sail of amber flame;
355,DEVIL’S EDGE,And soon the new moon rode on high
356,DEVIL’S EDGE,Through cloudless deeps of crystal sky.
357,DEVIL’S EDGE,
358,DEVIL’S EDGE,Too holy seemed the night for sleep:
359,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And yet, I must have slept, it seems;"
360,DEVIL’S EDGE,"For, suddenly, I woke to hear"
361,DEVIL’S EDGE,"A strange voice singing, shrill and clear,"
362,DEVIL’S EDGE,Down in a gully black and deep
363,DEVIL’S EDGE,That cleft the beetling crag in twain.
364,DEVIL’S EDGE,It seemed the very voice of dreams
365,DEVIL’S EDGE,That drive hag-ridden souls in fear
366,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Through echoing, unearthly vales,"
367,DEVIL’S EDGE,"To plunge in black, slow-crawling streams,"
368,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Seeking to drown that cry, in vain..."
369,DEVIL’S EDGE,Or some sea creature’s voice that wails
370,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Through blind, white banks of fog unlifting"
371,DEVIL’S EDGE,To God-forgotten sailors drifting
372,DEVIL’S EDGE,Rudderless to death...
373,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And as I heard,"
374,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Though no wind stirred,"
375,DEVIL’S EDGE,An icy breath
376,DEVIL’S EDGE,Was in my hair...
377,DEVIL’S EDGE,And clutched my heart with cold despair...
378,DEVIL’S EDGE,"But, as the wild song died away,"
379,DEVIL’S EDGE,There came a faltering break
380,DEVIL’S EDGE,That shivered to a sobbing fall;
381,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And seemed half-human, after all..."
382,DEVIL’S EDGE,
383,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And yet, what foot could find a track"
384,DEVIL’S EDGE,"In that deep gully, sheer and black..."
385,DEVIL’S EDGE,And singing wildly in the night!
386,DEVIL’S EDGE,"So, wondering I lay awake,"
387,DEVIL’S EDGE,Until the coming of the light
388,DEVIL’S EDGE,Brought day’s familiar presence back.
389,DEVIL’S EDGE,
390,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Down by the harbour-mouth that day,"
391,DEVIL’S EDGE,A fisher told the tale to me.
392,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Three months before, while out at sea,"
393,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Young Philip Burn was lost, though how,"
394,DEVIL’S EDGE,"None knew, and none would ever know."
395,DEVIL’S EDGE,The boat becalmed at noonday lay...
396,DEVIL’S EDGE,And not a ripple on the sea...
397,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And Philip standing in the bow,"
398,DEVIL’S EDGE,When his six comrades went below
399,DEVIL’S EDGE,"To sleep away an hour or so,"
400,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Dog-tired with working day and night,"
401,DEVIL’S EDGE,While he kept watch ... and not a sound
402,DEVIL’S EDGE,"They heard, until, at set of sun"
403,DEVIL’S EDGE,"They woke; and coming up, they found"
404,DEVIL’S EDGE,"The deck was empty, Philip gone..."
405,DEVIL’S EDGE,Yet not another boat in sight...
406,DEVIL’S EDGE,And not a ripple on the sea.
407,DEVIL’S EDGE,"How he had vanished, none could tell."
408,DEVIL’S EDGE,They only knew the lad was dead
409,DEVIL’S EDGE,"They’d left but now, alive and well..."
410,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And he, poor fellow, newly-wed..."
411,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And when they broke the news to her,"
412,DEVIL’S EDGE,She spoke no word to anyone:
413,DEVIL’S EDGE,"But sat all day, and would not stir--"
414,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Just staring, staring in the fire,"
415,DEVIL’S EDGE,With eyes that never seemed to tire;
416,DEVIL’S EDGE,"Until, at last, the day was done,"
417,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And darkness came; when she would rise,"
418,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And seek the door with queer, wild eyes;"
419,DEVIL’S EDGE,And wander singing all the night
420,DEVIL’S EDGE,Unearthly songs beside the sea:
421,DEVIL’S EDGE,But always the first blink of light
422,DEVIL’S EDGE,Would find her back at her own door.
423,DEVIL’S EDGE,
424,DEVIL’S EDGE,’Twas Winter when I came once more
425,DEVIL’S EDGE,To that old village by the shore:
426,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And as, at night, I climbed the street,"
427,DEVIL’S EDGE,"I heard a singing, low and sweet,"
428,DEVIL’S EDGE,Within a cottage near at hand:
429,DEVIL’S EDGE,And I was glad awhile to stand
430,DEVIL’S EDGE,And listen by the glowing pane:
431,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And as I hearkened, that sweet strain"
432,DEVIL’S EDGE,Brought back the night when I had lain
433,DEVIL’S EDGE,Awake on Devil’s Edge...
434,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And now I knew the voice again,"
435,DEVIL’S EDGE,"So different, free of pain and fear--"
436,DEVIL’S EDGE,Its terror turned to tenderness--
437,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And yet the same voice none the less,"
438,DEVIL’S EDGE,Though singing now so true and clear
439,DEVIL’S EDGE,"And drawing nigh the window-ledge,"
440,DEVIL’S EDGE,I watched the mother sing to rest
441,DEVIL’S EDGE,The baby snuggling to her breast.
442,DEVIL’S EDGE,
443,DEVIL’S EDGE,
444,DEVIL’S EDGE,
445,DEVIL’S EDGE,
446,THE LILAC TREE,THE LILAC TREE
447,THE LILAC TREE,
448,THE LILAC TREE,"""I planted her the lilac tree"
449,THE LILAC TREE,Upon our wedding day:
450,THE LILAC TREE,"But, when the time of blossom came,"
451,THE LILAC TREE,With her dead babe she lay...
452,THE LILAC TREE,"And, as I stood beside the bed,"
453,THE LILAC TREE,The scent of lilac filled the room:
454,THE LILAC TREE,"And always when I smell the bloom,"
455,THE LILAC TREE,"I think upon the dead."""
456,THE LILAC TREE,
457,THE LILAC TREE,"He spoke: and, speaking, sauntered on,"
458,THE LILAC TREE,The young girl by his side:
459,THE LILAC TREE,"And then they talked no more of death,"
460,THE LILAC TREE,But only of the happy things
461,THE LILAC TREE,"That burst their buds, and spread their wings,"
462,THE LILAC TREE,"And break in song at Whitsuntide,"
463,THE LILAC TREE,"That burst to bloom at Whitsuntide,"
464,THE LILAC TREE,And bring the summer in a breath.
465,THE LILAC TREE,
466,THE LILAC TREE,"And, as they talked, the young girl’s life"
467,THE LILAC TREE,Broke into bloom and song;
468,THE LILAC TREE,"And, one with all the happy things"
469,THE LILAC TREE,"That burst their buds, and spread their wings,"
470,THE LILAC TREE,"Her very blood was singing,"
471,THE LILAC TREE,And at her pulses ringing;
472,THE LILAC TREE,"Life tingled through her, sweet and strong,"
473,THE LILAC TREE,From secret sources springing:
474,THE LILAC TREE,"And, all at once, a quickening strife"
475,THE LILAC TREE,"Of hopes and fears was in her heart,"
476,THE LILAC TREE,Where only wondering joy had been;
477,THE LILAC TREE,"And, kindling with a sudden light,"
478,THE LILAC TREE,Her eyes had sight
479,THE LILAC TREE,Of things unseen:
480,THE LILAC TREE,"And, in a flash, a woman grown,"
481,THE LILAC TREE,"With pangs of knowledge, fierce and keen,"
482,THE LILAC TREE,She knew strange things unknown.
483,THE LILAC TREE,
484,THE LILAC TREE,"A year went by: at Whitsuntide,"
485,THE LILAC TREE,"He brought her home, a bride."
486,THE LILAC TREE,
487,THE LILAC TREE,He planted her no lilac tree
488,THE LILAC TREE,Upon their wedding day:
489,THE LILAC TREE,"And strange distress came over her,"
490,THE LILAC TREE,As on the bed she lay:
491,THE LILAC TREE,"For as he stood beside the bed,"
492,THE LILAC TREE,The scent of lilac filled the room.
493,THE LILAC TREE,"Her heart knew well he smelt the bloom,"
494,THE LILAC TREE,And thought upon the dead.
495,THE LILAC TREE,"Yet, she was glad to be his wife:"
496,THE LILAC TREE,"And when the blossom-time was past,"
497,THE LILAC TREE,Her days no more were overcast;
498,THE LILAC TREE,And deep she drank of life:
499,THE LILAC TREE,"And, thronged with happy household cares,"
500,THE LILAC TREE,Her busy days went pleasantly:
501,THE LILAC TREE,Her foot was light upon the stairs;
502,THE LILAC TREE,"And every room rang merrily,"
503,THE LILAC TREE,"And merrily, and merrily,"
504,THE LILAC TREE,"With song and mirth, for unto her"
505,THE LILAC TREE,"His heart seemed hers, and hers alone:"
506,THE LILAC TREE,Until new dreams began to stir
507,THE LILAC TREE,Her wondering breast with bliss unknown
508,THE LILAC TREE,Of some new miracle to be:
509,THE LILAC TREE,"And, though she moved more quietly,"
510,THE LILAC TREE,"And seldom sang, yet, happily,"
511,THE LILAC TREE,From happy dawn to happy night
512,THE LILAC TREE,The mother’s eyes shone bright.
513,THE LILAC TREE,
514,THE LILAC TREE,"But, as her time drew near,"
515,THE LILAC TREE,Her heart was filled with fear:
516,THE LILAC TREE,"And when the lilac burst to bloom,"
517,THE LILAC TREE,"And brought the Summer in a breath,"
518,THE LILAC TREE,"A presence seemed to fill the room,"
519,THE LILAC TREE,And fill her heart with death:
520,THE LILAC TREE,"And, as her husband lay asleep,"
521,THE LILAC TREE,"Beside her, on the bed,"
522,THE LILAC TREE,Into her breast the thought would creep
523,THE LILAC TREE,That he was dreaming of the dead.
524,THE LILAC TREE,And all the mother’s heart in her
525,THE LILAC TREE,Was mad with mother-jealousy
526,THE LILAC TREE,Of that sweet scented lilac tree;
527,THE LILAC TREE,"And, blind with savage ecstasy,"
528,THE LILAC TREE,"Night after night she lay,"
529,THE LILAC TREE,"Until the blink of day,"
530,THE LILAC TREE,"With staring eyes and wild,"
531,THE LILAC TREE,"Half-crazy, lest the lilac tree"
532,THE LILAC TREE,Should come betwixt him and his child.
533,THE LILAC TREE,"By day, her mother-tenderness"
534,THE LILAC TREE,"Was turned to brooding bitterness,"
535,THE LILAC TREE,Whene’er she looked upon the bloom:
536,THE LILAC TREE,"And, if she slept at all at night,"
537,THE LILAC TREE,Her heart would waken in affright
538,THE LILAC TREE,To smell the lilac in the gloom:
539,THE LILAC TREE,"And, when it rained, it seemed to her,"
540,THE LILAC TREE,The fresh keen scent was bitterer:
541,THE LILAC TREE,"Though, when the blaze of morning came,"
542,THE LILAC TREE,"And flooded all the room,"
543,THE LILAC TREE,The perfume burnt her heart like flame.
544,THE LILAC TREE,"As, in the dark,"
545,THE LILAC TREE,"One night she lay,"
546,THE LILAC TREE,A dark thought shot
547,THE LILAC TREE,Through her hot heart:
548,THE LILAC TREE,"And, from a spark"
549,THE LILAC TREE,"Of smouldering wrong,"
550,THE LILAC TREE,Hate burst to fire.
551,THE LILAC TREE,"Now, quaking cold,"
552,THE LILAC TREE,"Now, quivering hot,"
553,THE LILAC TREE,"With breath indrawn,"
554,THE LILAC TREE,"Through time untold,"
555,THE LILAC TREE,She ’waited dawn
556,THE LILAC TREE,That lagged too long
557,THE LILAC TREE,For her desire.
558,THE LILAC TREE,
559,THE LILAC TREE,"And when, at last, at break of day,"
560,THE LILAC TREE,"Her husband rose, and went his way"
561,THE LILAC TREE,"About his daily toil,"
562,THE LILAC TREE,"She, too, arose, and dressed,"
563,THE LILAC TREE,With frenzy in her breast;
564,THE LILAC TREE,"And stole downstairs, and took a spade,"
565,THE LILAC TREE,"And digged about the lilac roots,"
566,THE LILAC TREE,And laid them bare of soil:
567,THE LILAC TREE,"Then, with a jagged blade,"
568,THE LILAC TREE,She hacked and slashed the naked roots--
569,THE LILAC TREE,"She hacked and slashed with frantic hand,"
570,THE LILAC TREE,Until the lilac scarce might stand;
571,THE LILAC TREE,And then again the soil she laid
572,THE LILAC TREE,About the bleeding roots--
573,THE LILAC TREE,"(It seemed to her, the sap ran red"
574,THE LILAC TREE,About the writhing roots!)
575,THE LILAC TREE,"But, now her heart was eased of strife,"
576,THE LILAC TREE,Since she had sapped the lilac’s life;
577,THE LILAC TREE,"And, frenzy-spent, she dropped the knife:"
578,THE LILAC TREE,"Then, dizzily she crept to bed,"
579,THE LILAC TREE,And lay all day as one nigh dead.
580,THE LILAC TREE,
581,THE LILAC TREE,"That night a sudden storm awoke,"
582,THE LILAC TREE,And struck the slumbering earth to life:
583,THE LILAC TREE,"And, as the heavens in thunder broke,"
584,THE LILAC TREE,She lay exulting in the strife
585,THE LILAC TREE,"Of flash and peal,"
586,THE LILAC TREE,And gust and rain;
587,THE LILAC TREE,"For now, she thought: the lightning-stroke"
588,THE LILAC TREE,Will lay the lilac low;
589,THE LILAC TREE,And he need never know
590,THE LILAC TREE,"How I ... and then, again,"
591,THE LILAC TREE,"Her heart went cold with dread,"
592,THE LILAC TREE,As she remembered that the knife
593,THE LILAC TREE,Still lay beneath the lilac tree...
594,THE LILAC TREE,"A blinding flash,"
595,THE LILAC TREE,"A lull, a crash,"
596,THE LILAC TREE,A rattling peal...
597,THE LILAC TREE,"And suddenly,"
598,THE LILAC TREE,She felt her senses reel:
599,THE LILAC TREE,"And, crying out: ""The knife!  The knife!"""
600,THE LILAC TREE,Her pangs were on her...
601,THE LILAC TREE,"Dawn was red,"
602,THE LILAC TREE,When she awoke upon the bed
603,THE LILAC TREE,To life--and knew her babe was dead.
604,THE LILAC TREE,She rose: and cried out fearfully:
605,THE LILAC TREE,"""The lilac tree!  The lilac tree!"""
606,THE LILAC TREE,Then fell back in a swoon.
607,THE LILAC TREE,
608,THE LILAC TREE,"But, when she waked again at noon,"
609,THE LILAC TREE,And looked upon her sleeping child;
610,THE LILAC TREE,"And laid her hand upon its head,"
611,THE LILAC TREE,"No more the mother’s heart was wild,"
612,THE LILAC TREE,For hate and fear were dead;
613,THE LILAC TREE,And all her brooding bitterness
614,THE LILAC TREE,Broke into tears of tenderness.
615,THE LILAC TREE,
616,THE LILAC TREE,"And, not a word the father said"
617,THE LILAC TREE,"About the lilac, lying dead."
618,THE LILAC TREE,
619,THE LILAC TREE,"A week went by, and Whitsuntide"
620,THE LILAC TREE,"Came round: and, as she lay,"
621,THE LILAC TREE,"And looked upon the newborn day,"
622,THE LILAC TREE,"Her husband, lying by her side,"
623,THE LILAC TREE,Spoke to her very tenderly:
624,THE LILAC TREE,"""Wife, ’tis again our wedding day,"
625,THE LILAC TREE,And we will plant a lilac tree
626,THE LILAC TREE,"In memory of the babe that died."""
627,THE LILAC TREE,
628,THE LILAC TREE,They planted a white lilac tree
629,THE LILAC TREE,Upon their wedding day:
630,THE LILAC TREE,"And, when the time of blossom came,"
631,THE LILAC TREE,With kindly hearts they lay.
632,THE LILAC TREE,The sunlight streamed upon the bed:
633,THE LILAC TREE,The scent of lilac filled the room:
634,THE LILAC TREE,"And, as they smelt the breathing bloom,"
635,THE LILAC TREE,They thought upon the dead.
636,THE LILAC TREE,
637,THE LILAC TREE,
638,THE LILAC TREE,
639,THE LILAC TREE,
640,THE OLD MAN,THE OLD MAN
641,THE OLD MAN,
642,THE OLD MAN,The boat put in at dead of night;
643,THE OLD MAN,"And, when I reached the house, ’twas sleeping dark."
644,THE OLD MAN,I knew my gentlest tap would be a spark
645,THE OLD MAN,To set my home alight:
646,THE OLD MAN,My mother ever listening in her sleep
647,THE OLD MAN,"For my returning step, would leap"
648,THE OLD MAN,Awake with welcome; and my father’s eyes
649,THE OLD MAN,Would twinkle merrily to greet me;
650,THE OLD MAN,And my young sister would run down to meet me
651,THE OLD MAN,With sleepy sweet surprise.
652,THE OLD MAN,
653,THE OLD MAN,"And yet, awhile, I lingered"
654,THE OLD MAN,"Upon the threshold, listening;"
655,THE OLD MAN,"And watched the cold stars glistening,"
656,THE OLD MAN,And seemed to hear the deep
657,THE OLD MAN,Calm breathing of the house asleep--
658,THE OLD MAN,"In easy sleep, so deep, I almost feared to break it;"
659,THE OLD MAN,"And, even as I fingered"
660,THE OLD MAN,"The knocker, loth to wake it,"
661,THE OLD MAN,Like some uncanny inkling
662,THE OLD MAN,"Of news from otherwhere,"
663,THE OLD MAN,"I felt a cold breath in my hair,"
664,THE OLD MAN,"As though, with chin upon my shoulder,"
665,THE OLD MAN,"One waited hard, upon my heel,"
666,THE OLD MAN,"With pricking eyes of steel,"
667,THE OLD MAN,Though well I knew that not a soul was there.
668,THE OLD MAN,
669,THE OLD MAN,"Until, at last, grown bolder,"
670,THE OLD MAN,"I rapped; and in a twinkling,"
671,THE OLD MAN,The house was all afire
672,THE OLD MAN,With welcome in the night:
673,THE OLD MAN,"First, in my mother’s room, a light;"
674,THE OLD MAN,"And then, her foot upon the stair;"
675,THE OLD MAN,A bolt shot back; a candle’s flare:
676,THE OLD MAN,A happy cry; and to her breast
677,THE OLD MAN,She hugged her heart’s desire:
678,THE OLD MAN,And hushed her fears to rest.
679,THE OLD MAN,
680,THE OLD MAN,"Then, shivering in the keen night air,"
681,THE OLD MAN,"My sleepy sister, laughing came;"
682,THE OLD MAN,And drew us in: and stirred to flame
683,THE OLD MAN,The smouldering kitchen-fire; and set
684,THE OLD MAN,The kettle on the kindling red:
685,THE OLD MAN,"And, as I watched the homely blaze,"
686,THE OLD MAN,And thought of wandering days
687,THE OLD MAN,With sharp regret;
688,THE OLD MAN,I missed my father: then I heard
689,THE OLD MAN,How he was still a-bed;
690,THE OLD MAN,"And had been ailing, for a day or so;"
691,THE OLD MAN,"But, now was waking, if I’d go..."
692,THE OLD MAN,"My foot already on the stair,"
693,THE OLD MAN,In answer to my mother’s word
694,THE OLD MAN,"I turned; and saw in dull amaze,"
695,THE OLD MAN,"Behind her, as she stood all unaware,"
696,THE OLD MAN,An old man sitting in my father’s chair.
697,THE OLD MAN,"A strange old man ... yet, as I looked at him,"
698,THE OLD MAN,"Before my eyes, a dim"
699,THE OLD MAN,Remembrance seemed to swim
700,THE OLD MAN,"Of some old man, who’d lurked about the boat,"
701,THE OLD MAN,While we were still at sea;
702,THE OLD MAN,"And who had crouched beside me, at the oar,"
703,THE OLD MAN,As we had rowed ashore;
704,THE OLD MAN,"Though, at the time, I’d taken little note,"
705,THE OLD MAN,I felt I’d seen that strange old man before:
706,THE OLD MAN,"But, how he’d come to follow me,"
707,THE OLD MAN,Unknown...
708,THE OLD MAN,And to be sitting there...
709,THE OLD MAN,"Then I recalled the cold breath in my hair,"
710,THE OLD MAN,"When I had stood, alone,"
711,THE OLD MAN,Before the bolted door.
712,THE OLD MAN,
713,THE OLD MAN,"And now my mother, wondering sore"
714,THE OLD MAN,"To see me stare and stare,"
715,THE OLD MAN,"So strangely, at an empty chair,"
716,THE OLD MAN,"Turned, too; and saw the old man there."
717,THE OLD MAN,
718,THE OLD MAN,"And as she turned, he slowly raised"
719,THE OLD MAN,His drooping head;
720,THE OLD MAN,And looked upon her with her husband’s eyes.
721,THE OLD MAN,"She stood, a moment, dazed;"
722,THE OLD MAN,"And watched him slowly rise,"
723,THE OLD MAN,As though to come to her:
724,THE OLD MAN,"Then, with a cry, she sped"
725,THE OLD MAN,"Upstairs, ere I could stir."
726,THE OLD MAN,
727,THE OLD MAN,"Still dazed, I let her go, alone:"
728,THE OLD MAN,I heard her footstep overhead:
729,THE OLD MAN,"I heard her drop beside the bed,"
730,THE OLD MAN,With low forsaken moan.
731,THE OLD MAN,
732,THE OLD MAN,"Yet, I could only stare and stare"
733,THE OLD MAN,Upon my father’s empty chair.
734,THE OLD MAN,
735,THE OLD MAN,
736,THE OLD MAN,
737,THE OLD MAN,
738,THE HARE,THE HARE
739,THE HARE,
740,THE HARE,"My hands were hot upon a hare,"
741,THE HARE,"Half-strangled, struggling in a snare--"
742,THE HARE,My knuckles at her warm wind-pipe--
743,THE HARE,"When suddenly, her eyes shot back,"
744,THE HARE,"Big, fearful, staggering and black:"
745,THE HARE,"And, ere I knew, my grip was slack;"
746,THE HARE,"And I was clutching empty air,"
747,THE HARE,"Half-mad, half-glad at my lost luck..."
748,THE HARE,When I awoke beside the stack.
749,THE HARE,
750,THE HARE,"’Twas just the minute when the snipe,"
751,THE HARE,"As though clock-wakened, every jack,"
752,THE HARE,"An hour ere dawn, dart in and out"
753,THE HARE,"The mist-wreaths filling syke and slack,"
754,THE HARE,"And flutter wheeling round about,"
755,THE HARE,And drumming out the Summer night.
756,THE HARE,I lay star-gazing yet a bit;
757,THE HARE,"Then, chilly-skinned, I sat upright,"
758,THE HARE,To shrug the shivers from my back;
759,THE HARE,"And, drawing out a straw to suck,"
760,THE HARE,My teeth nipped through it at a bite...
761,THE HARE,The liveliest lad is out of pluck
762,THE HARE,An hour ere dawn--a tame cock-sparrow--
763,THE HARE,"When cold stars shiver through his marrow,"
764,THE HARE,And wet mist soaks his mother-wit.
765,THE HARE,"But, as the snipe dropped, one by one;"
766,THE HARE,And one by one the stars blinked out;
767,THE HARE,I knew ’twould only need the sun
768,THE HARE,To send the shudders right about:
769,THE HARE,"And, as the clear East faded white,"
770,THE HARE,I watched and wearied for the sun--
771,THE HARE,"The jolly, welcome, friendly sun--"
772,THE HARE,The sleepy sluggard of a sun
773,THE HARE,"That still kept snoozing out of sight,"
774,THE HARE,Though well he knew the night was done
775,THE HARE,"And, after all, he caught me dozing,"
776,THE HARE,"And leapt up, laughing, in the sky"
777,THE HARE,Just as my lazy eyes were closing:
778,THE HARE,And it was good as gold to lie
779,THE HARE,"Full-length among the straw, and feel"
780,THE HARE,"The day wax warmer every minute,"
781,THE HARE,"As, glowing glad, from head to heel,"
782,THE HARE,I soaked and rolled rejoicing in it...
783,THE HARE,"When from the corner of my eye,"
784,THE HARE,"Upon a heathery knowe hard-by,"
785,THE HARE,"With long lugs cocked, and eyes astare,"
786,THE HARE,"Yet all serene, I saw a hare."
787,THE HARE,
788,THE HARE,"Upon my belly in the straw,"
789,THE HARE,"I lay, and watched her sleek her fur,"
790,THE HARE,"As, daintily, with well-licked paw,"
791,THE HARE,She washed her face and neck and ears:
792,THE HARE,"Then, clean and comely in the sun,"
793,THE HARE,"She kicked her heels up, full of fun,"
794,THE HARE,As if she did not care a pin
795,THE HARE,"Though she should jump out of her skin,"
796,THE HARE,"And leapt and lolloped, free of fears,"
797,THE HARE,Until my heart frisked round with her.
798,THE HARE,"""And yet, if I but lift my head,"
799,THE HARE,"You’ll scamper off, young Puss,"" I said."
800,THE HARE,"""Still, I can’t lie, and watch you play,"
801,THE HARE,Upon my belly half-the-day.
802,THE HARE,The Lord alone knows where I’m going:
803,THE HARE,"But, I had best be getting there."
804,THE HARE,Last night I loosed you from the snare--
805,THE HARE,"Asleep, or waking, who’s for knowing!--"
806,THE HARE,"So, I shall thank you now for showing"
807,THE HARE,Which art to take to bring me where
808,THE HARE,My luck awaits me.  When you’re ready
809,THE HARE,"To start, I’ll follow on your track."
810,THE HARE,"Though slow of foot, I’m sure and steady..."""
811,THE HARE,"She pricked her ears, then set them back;"
812,THE HARE,And like a shot was out of sight:
813,THE HARE,"And, with a happy heart and light,"
814,THE HARE,As quickly I was on my feet;
815,THE HARE,"And following the way she went,"
816,THE HARE,"Keen as a lurcher on the scent,"
817,THE HARE,"Across the heather and the bent,"
818,THE HARE,Across the quaking moss and peat.
819,THE HARE,"Of course, I lost her soon enough,"
820,THE HARE,For moorland tracks are steep and rough;
821,THE HARE,And hares are made of nimbler stuff
822,THE HARE,"Than any lad of seventeen,"
823,THE HARE,"However lanky-legged and tough,"
824,THE HARE,"However, kestrel-eyed and keen:"
825,THE HARE,And I’d at last to stop and eat
826,THE HARE,The little bit of bread and meat
827,THE HARE,Left in my pocket overnight.
828,THE HARE,"So, in a hollow, snug and green,"
829,THE HARE,"I sat beside a burn, and dipped"
830,THE HARE,The dry bread in an icy pool;
831,THE HARE,And munched a breakfast fresh and cool...
832,THE HARE,And then sat gaping like a fool...
833,THE HARE,"For, right before my very eyes,"
834,THE HARE,"With lugs acock, and eyes astare,"
835,THE HARE,I saw again the selfsame hare.
836,THE HARE,
837,THE HARE,"So, up I jumped, and off she slipped:"
838,THE HARE,And I kept sight of her until
839,THE HARE,"I stumbled in a hole, and tripped;"
840,THE HARE,"And came a heavy, headlong spill:"
841,THE HARE,"And she, ere I’d the wit to rise,"
842,THE HARE,"Was o’er the hill, and out of sight:"
843,THE HARE,"And, sore and shaken with the tumbling,"
844,THE HARE,"And sicker at my foot for stumbling,"
845,THE HARE,"I cursed my luck, and went on, grumbling,"
846,THE HARE,The way her flying heels had fled.
847,THE HARE,
848,THE HARE,The sky was cloudless overhead;
849,THE HARE,And just alive with larks asinging:
850,THE HARE,"And, in a twinkling, I was swinging"
851,THE HARE,"Across the windy hills, lighthearted."
852,THE HARE,"A kestrel at my footstep started,"
853,THE HARE,"Just pouncing on a frightened mouse,"
854,THE HARE,And hung o’erhead with wings a-hover:
855,THE HARE,Through rustling heath an adder darted:
856,THE HARE,A hundred rabbits bobbed to cover:
857,THE HARE,"A weasel, sleek and rusty-red,"
858,THE HARE,Popped out of sight as quick as winking:
859,THE HARE,I saw a grizzled vixen slinking
860,THE HARE,Behind a clucking brood of grouse
861,THE HARE,That rose and cackled at my coming:
862,THE HARE,And all about my way were flying
863,THE HARE,"The peewit, with their slow wings creaking"
864,THE HARE,"And little jack-snipe darted, drumming:"
865,THE HARE,And now and then a golden plover
866,THE HARE,Or redshank piped with reedy whistle.
867,THE HARE,But never shaken bent or thistle
868,THE HARE,Betrayed the quarry I was seeking
869,THE HARE,"And not an instant, anywhere"
870,THE HARE,Did I clap eyes upon a hare.
871,THE HARE,
872,THE HARE,"So, travelling still, the twilight caught me:"
873,THE HARE,"And as I stumbled on, I muttered:"
874,THE HARE,"""A deal of luck the hare has brought me!"
875,THE HARE,The wind and I must spend together
876,THE HARE,A hungry night among the heather.
877,THE HARE,"If I’d her here...""  And as I uttered,"
878,THE HARE,"I tripped, and heard a frightened squeal;"
879,THE HARE,And dropped my hands in time to feel
880,THE HARE,The hare just bolting ’twixt my feet.
881,THE HARE,She slipped my clutch: and I stood there
882,THE HARE,"And cursed that devil-littered hare,"
883,THE HARE,That left me stranded in the dark
884,THE HARE,In that wide waste of quaggy peat
885,THE HARE,Beneath black night without a spark:
886,THE HARE,"When, looking up, I saw a flare"
887,THE HARE,"Upon a far-off hill, and said:"
888,THE HARE,"""By God, the heather is afire!"
889,THE HARE,"It’s mischief at this time of year..."""
890,THE HARE,"And then, as one bright flame shot higher,"
891,THE HARE,And booths and vans stood out quite clear;
892,THE HARE,My wits came back into my head:
893,THE HARE,And I remembered Brough Hill Fair.
894,THE HARE,"And, as I stumbled towards the glare,"
895,THE HARE,I knew the sudden kindling meant
896,THE HARE,The Fair was over for the day;
897,THE HARE,And all the cattle-folk away
898,THE HARE,And gipsy-folk and tinkers now
899,THE HARE,Were lighting supper-fires without
900,THE HARE,Each caravan and booth and tent.
901,THE HARE,"And, as I climbed the stiff hill-brow,"
902,THE HARE,I quite forgot my lucky hare.
903,THE HARE,I’d something else to think about:
904,THE HARE,For well I knew there’s broken meat
905,THE HARE,For empty bellies after fair-time;
906,THE HARE,And looked to have a royal rare time
907,THE HARE,With something rich and prime to eat:
908,THE HARE,And then to lie and toast my feet
909,THE HARE,All night beside the biggest fire.
910,THE HARE,
911,THE HARE,"But, even as I neared the first,"
912,THE HARE,A pleasant whiff of stewing burst
913,THE HARE,From out a smoking pot a-bubble:
914,THE HARE,"And, as I stopped behind the folk"
915,THE HARE,"Who sprawled around, and watched it seething"
916,THE HARE,"A woman heard my eager breathing,"
917,THE HARE,"And, turning, caught my hungry eye:"
918,THE HARE,"And called out to me: ""Draw in nigher,"
919,THE HARE,Unless you find it too much trouble;
920,THE HARE,"Or you’ve a nose for better fare,"
921,THE HARE,And go to supper with the Squire...
922,THE HARE,"You’ve got the hungry parson’s air!"""
923,THE HARE,"And all looked up, and took the joke,"
924,THE HARE,As I dropped gladly to the ground
925,THE HARE,"Among them, where they all lay gazing"
926,THE HARE,Upon the bubbling and the blazing.
927,THE HARE,My eyes were dazzled by the fire
928,THE HARE,At first; and then I glanced around;
929,THE HARE,"And, in those swarthy, fire-lit faces--"
930,THE HARE,Though drowsing in the glare and heat
931,THE HARE,"And snuffing the warm savour in,"
932,THE HARE,Dead-certain of their fill of meat--
933,THE HARE,"I felt the bit between the teeth,"
934,THE HARE,"The flying heels, the broken traces,"
935,THE HARE,And heard the highroad ring beneath
936,THE HARE,The trampling hoofs: and knew them kin.
937,THE HARE,"Then for the first time, standing there"
938,THE HARE,"Behind the woman who had hailed me,"
939,THE HARE,I saw a girl with eyes astare
940,THE HARE,That looked in terror o’er my head:
941,THE HARE,"And, all at once, my courage failed me..."
942,THE HARE,"For now again, and sore-adread,"
943,THE HARE,"My hands were hot upon a hare,"
944,THE HARE,"That struggled, strangling in the snare..."
945,THE HARE,"Then once more as the girl stood clear,"
946,THE HARE,Before me--quaking cold with fear
947,THE HARE,I saw the hare look from her eyes...
948,THE HARE,
949,THE HARE,"And when, at last, I turned to see"
950,THE HARE,"What held her scared, I saw a man--"
951,THE HARE,A fat man with dull eyes aleer--
952,THE HARE,Within the shadow of the van:
953,THE HARE,And I was on the point to rise
954,THE HARE,"To send him spinning ’mid the wheels,"
955,THE HARE,"And twist his neck between his heels,"
956,THE HARE,And stop his leering grin with mud...
957,THE HARE,And would have done it in a tick...
958,THE HARE,"When, suddenly, alive with fright,"
959,THE HARE,"She started, with red, parted lips,"
960,THE HARE,"As though she guessed we’d come to grips,"
961,THE HARE,And turned her black eyes full on me...
962,THE HARE,"And, as I looked into their light,"
963,THE HARE,"My heart forgot the lust of fight,"
964,THE HARE,"And something shot me to the quick,"
965,THE HARE,"And ran like wildfire through my blood,"
966,THE HARE,And tingled to my finger-tips...
967,THE HARE,"And, in a dazzling flash, I knew"
968,THE HARE,I’d never been alive before...
969,THE HARE,And she was mine for evermore.
970,THE HARE,
971,THE HARE,While all the others slept asnore
972,THE HARE,"In caravan and tent that night,"
973,THE HARE,I lay alone beside the fire;
974,THE HARE,"And stared into its blazing core,"
975,THE HARE,"With eyes that would not shut or tire,"
976,THE HARE,"Because the best of all was true,"
977,THE HARE,And they looked still into the light
978,THE HARE,"Of her eyes, burning ever bright."
979,THE HARE,Within the brightest coal for me...
980,THE HARE,"Once more, I saw her, as she started,"
981,THE HARE,And glanced at me with red lips parted:
982,THE HARE,"And, as she looked, the frightened hare"
983,THE HARE,"Had fled her eyes; and, merrily,"
984,THE HARE,"She smiled, with fine teeth flashing white,"
985,THE HARE,"As though she, too, were happy-hearted..."
986,THE HARE,"Then she had trembled suddenly,"
987,THE HARE,"And dropped her eyes, as that fat man"
988,THE HARE,"Stepped from the shadow of the van,"
989,THE HARE,"And joined the circle, as the pot"
990,THE HARE,"Was lifted off, and, piping-hot,"
991,THE HARE,The supper steamed in wooden bowls.
992,THE HARE,"Yet, she had hardly touched a bite:"
993,THE HARE,And never raised her eyes all night
994,THE HARE,"To mine again: but on the coals,"
995,THE HARE,"As I sat staring, she had stared--"
996,THE HARE,"The black curls, shining round her head"
997,THE HARE,"From under the red kerchief, tied"
998,THE HARE,So nattily beneath her chin--
999,THE HARE,And she had stolen off to bed
1000,THE HARE,"Quite early, looking dazed and scared."
1001,THE HARE,"Then, all agape and sleepy-eyed,"
1002,THE HARE,Ere long the others had turned in:
1003,THE HARE,"And I was rid of that fat man,"
1004,THE HARE,Who slouched away to his own van.
1005,THE HARE,
1006,THE HARE,"And now, before her van, I lay,"
1007,THE HARE,"With sleepless eyes, awaiting day:"
1008,THE HARE,"And, as I gazed upon the glare,"
1009,THE HARE,"I heard, behind, a gentle stir:"
1010,THE HARE,"And, turning round, I looked on her"
1011,THE HARE,Where she stood on the little stair
1012,THE HARE,"Outside the van, with listening air--"
1013,THE HARE,"And, in her eyes, the hunted hare..."
1014,THE HARE,"And then, I saw her slip away,"
1015,THE HARE,"A bundle underneath her arm,"
1016,THE HARE,Without a single glance at me.
1017,THE HARE,"I lay a moment wondering,"
1018,THE HARE,"My heart a-thump like anything,"
1019,THE HARE,"Then, fearing she should come to harm,"
1020,THE HARE,"I rose, and followed speedily"
1021,THE HARE,Where she had vanished in the night.
1022,THE HARE,"And, as she heard my step behind,"
1023,THE HARE,"She started, and stopt dead with fright:"
1024,THE HARE,Then blundered on as if struck blind:
1025,THE HARE,"And now as I caught up with her,"
1026,THE HARE,"Just as she took the moorland track,"
1027,THE HARE,"I saw the hare’s eyes, big and black..."
1028,THE HARE,She made as though she’d double back...
1029,THE HARE,"But, when she looked into my eyes,"
1030,THE HARE,She stood quite still and did not stir...
1031,THE HARE,"And, picking up her fallen pack,"
1032,THE HARE,I tucked it ’neath my arm; and she
1033,THE HARE,Just took her luck quite quietly.
1034,THE HARE,"As she must take what chance might come,"
1035,THE HARE,"And would not have it otherwise,"
1036,THE HARE,"And walked into the night with me,"
1037,THE HARE,Without a word across the fells.
1038,THE HARE,
1039,THE HARE,"And, all about us, through the night,"
1040,THE HARE,"The mists were stealing, cold and white,"
1041,THE HARE,Down every rushy syke or slack:
1042,THE HARE,"But, soon the moon swung into sight:"
1043,THE HARE,"And, as we went, my heart was light,"
1044,THE HARE,And singing like a burn in flood:
1045,THE HARE,And in my ears were tinkling bells:
1046,THE HARE,My body was a rattled drum:
1047,THE HARE,And fifes were shrilling through my blood
1048,THE HARE,"That summer night, to think that she"
1049,THE HARE,Was walking through the world with me.
1050,THE HARE,
1051,THE HARE,"But when the air with dawn was chill,"
1052,THE HARE,"As we were travelling down a hill,"
1053,THE HARE,She broke her silence with low-sobbing:
1054,THE HARE,"And told her tale, her bosom throbbing"
1055,THE HARE,As though her very heart were shaken
1056,THE HARE,With fear she’d yet be overtaken...
1057,THE HARE,She’d always lived in caravans--
1058,THE HARE,"Her father’s, gay as any man’s,"
1059,THE HARE,"Grass-green, picked out with red and yellow"
1060,THE HARE,And glittering brave with burnished brass
1061,THE HARE,"That sparkled in the sun like flame,"
1062,THE HARE,"And window curtains, white as snow..."
1063,THE HARE,"But, they had died, ten years ago,"
1064,THE HARE,"Her parents both, when fever came..."
1065,THE HARE,"And they were buried, side by side,"
1066,THE HARE,Somewhere beneath the wayside grass...
1067,THE HARE,"In times of sickness, they kept wide"
1068,THE HARE,"Of towns and busybodies, so"
1069,THE HARE,No parson’s or policeman’s tricks
1070,THE HARE,Should bother them when in a fix...
1071,THE HARE,Her father never could abide
1072,THE HARE,"A black coat or a blue, poor man..."
1073,THE HARE,"And so, Long Dick, a kindly fellow,"
1074,THE HARE,"When you could keep him from the can,"
1075,THE HARE,"And Meg, his easy-going wife,"
1076,THE HARE,Had taken her into their van;
1077,THE HARE,And kept her since her parents died...
1078,THE HARE,"And she had lived a happy life,"
1079,THE HARE,Until Fat Pete’s young wife was taken...
1080,THE HARE,"But, ever since, he’d pestered her..."
1081,THE HARE,"And she dared scarcely breathe or stir,"
1082,THE HARE,Lest she should see his eyes aleer...
1083,THE HARE,"And many a night she’d lain and shaken,"
1084,THE HARE,And very nearly died of fear--
1085,THE HARE,Though safe enough within the van
1086,THE HARE,With Mother Meg and her good-man--
1087,THE HARE,"For, since Fat Pete was Long Dick’s friend,"
1088,THE HARE,And they were thick and sweet as honey;
1089,THE HARE,"And Dick owed Pete a pot of money,"
1090,THE HARE,She knew too well how it must end...
1091,THE HARE,And she would rather lie stone dead
1092,THE HARE,Beneath the wayside grass than wed
1093,THE HARE,"With leering Pete, and live the life,"
1094,THE HARE,"And die the death, of his first wife..."
1095,THE HARE,"And so, last night, clean-daft with dread,"
1096,THE HARE,She’d bundled up a pack and fled...
1097,THE HARE,
1098,THE HARE,"When all the sobbing tale was out,"
1099,THE HARE,"She dried her eyes, and looked about,"
1100,THE HARE,"As though she’d left all fear behind,"
1101,THE HARE,And out of sight were out of mind.
1102,THE HARE,"Then, when the dawn was burning red,"
1103,THE HARE,"""I’m hungry as a hawk!"" she said:"
1104,THE HARE,And from the bundle took out bread.
1105,THE HARE,"And, at the happy end of night,"
1106,THE HARE,We sat together by a burn:
1107,THE HARE,"And ate a thick slice, turn by turn;"
1108,THE HARE,And laughed and kissed between each bite.
1109,THE HARE,
1110,THE HARE,"Then, up again, and on our way"
1111,THE HARE,We went; and tramped the livelong day
1112,THE HARE,"The moorland trackways, steep and rough,"
1113,THE HARE,Though there was little fear enough
1114,THE HARE,That they would follow on our flight.
1115,THE HARE,
1116,THE HARE,And then again a shiny night
1117,THE HARE,"Among the honey-scented heather,"
1118,THE HARE,"We wandered in the moonblaze bright,"
1119,THE HARE,"Together through a land of light,"
1120,THE HARE,A lad and lass alone with life.
1121,THE HARE,"And merrily we laughed together,"
1122,THE HARE,"When, starting up from sleep, we heard"
1123,THE HARE,The cock-grouse talking to his wife...
1124,THE HARE,"And ""Old Fat Pete"" she called the bird."
1125,THE HARE,
1126,THE HARE,Six months and more have cantered by:
1127,THE HARE,"And, Winter past, we’re out again--"
1128,THE HARE,We’ve left the fat and weatherwise
1129,THE HARE,"To keep their coops and reeking sties,"
1130,THE HARE,"And eat their fill of oven-pies,"
1131,THE HARE,While we win free and out again
1132,THE HARE,To take potluck beneath the sky
1133,THE HARE,With sun and moon and wind and rain.
1134,THE HARE,"Six happy months ... and yet, at night,"
1135,THE HARE,"I’ve often wakened in affright,"
1136,THE HARE,"And looked upon her lying there,"
1137,THE HARE,"Beside me sleeping quietly,"
1138,THE HARE,"Adread that when she waked, I’d see"
1139,THE HARE,The hunted hare within her eyes.
1140,THE HARE,
1141,THE HARE,"And, only last night, as I slept"
1142,THE HARE,Beneath the shelter of a stack...
1143,THE HARE,"My hands were hot upon a hare,"
1144,THE HARE,"Half-strangled, struggling in the snare,"
1145,THE HARE,"When, suddenly, her eyes shot back,"
1146,THE HARE,"Big, fearful, staggering and black;"
1147,THE HARE,"And ere I knew, my grip was slack,"
1148,THE HARE,And I was clutching empty air...
1149,THE HARE,Bolt-upright from my sleep I leapt...
1150,THE HARE,Her place was empty in the straw...
1151,THE HARE,"And then, with quaking heart, I saw"
1152,THE HARE,"That she was standing in the night,"
1153,THE HARE,A leveret cuddled to her breast...
1154,THE HARE,
1155,THE HARE,"I spoke no word: but, as the light"
1156,THE HARE,"Through banks of Eastern cloud was breaking,"
1157,THE HARE,"She turned, and saw that I was waking:"
1158,THE HARE,And told me how she could not rest;
1159,THE HARE,"And, rising in the night, she’d found"
1160,THE HARE,This baby-hare crouched on the ground;
1161,THE HARE,And she had nursed it quite a while:
1162,THE HARE,"But, now, she’d better let it go..."
1163,THE HARE,Its mother would be fretting so...
1164,THE HARE,A mother’s heart...
1165,THE HARE,"I saw her smile,"
1166,THE HARE,And look at me with tender eyes:
1167,THE HARE,"And as I looked into their light,"
1168,THE HARE,"My foolish, fearful heart grew wise..."
1169,THE HARE,"And now, I knew that never there"
1170,THE HARE,"I’d see again the startled hare,"
1171,THE HARE,Or need to dread the dreams of night.
1172,THE HARE,
1173,THE HARE,1910-1911.
