164,ARGUMENT,before the palace of Inachus in Argos on a festival of Zeus.
165,ARGUMENT,He interrupts the ceremony by announcing fire and persuades
166,ARGUMENT,Inachus to dare the anger of Zeus and accept the gift. Inachus
167,ARGUMENT,fetching Argeia his wife from the palace has in turn to quiet
168,ARGUMENT,her fears. He asks a prophecy of Prometheus who foretells the
169,ARGUMENT,fate of Io their daughter. Prometheus then setting flame to the
170,ARGUMENT,altar and writing his own name thereon in the place of Zeus
171,ARGUMENT,disappears._

207,_PROMETHEUS._,"The Fates' decrees and bends the wills of the gods,"
208,_PROMETHEUS._,I come: and on the earth step with glad foot.
209,_PROMETHEUS._,"This variegated ocean-floor of the air,"
210,_PROMETHEUS._,"The changeful circle of fair land, that lies"
211,_PROMETHEUS._,"Heaven's dial, sisterly mirror of night and day:"
212,_PROMETHEUS._,"The wide o'er-wandered plain, this nether world"
213,_PROMETHEUS._,"My truant haunt is, when from jealous eyes"
214,_PROMETHEUS._,"I steal, for hither 'tis I steal, and here                            10"
215,_PROMETHEUS._,Unseen repair my joy: yet not unseen
216,_PROMETHEUS._,"Methinks, nor seen unguessed of him I seek."
217,_PROMETHEUS._,"Rather by swath or furrow, or where the path"
218,_PROMETHEUS._,"Is walled with corn I am found, by trellised vine"
219,_PROMETHEUS._,Or olive set in banks or orchard trim:
220,_PROMETHEUS._,"I watch all toil and tilth, farm, field and fold,"
221,_PROMETHEUS._,And taste the mortal joy; since not in heaven
222,_PROMETHEUS._,Among our easeful gods hath facile time
223,_PROMETHEUS._,"A touch so keen, to wake such love of life"
224,_PROMETHEUS._,"As stirs the frail and careful being, who here,                       20"
225,_PROMETHEUS._,"The king of sorrows, melancholy man,"
226,_PROMETHEUS._,"Bows at his labour, but in heart erect"
227,_PROMETHEUS._,"A god stands, nor for any gift of god"
228,_PROMETHEUS._,Would barter his immortal-hearted prime.
229,_PROMETHEUS._,"Could I but win this world from Zeus for mine,"
230,_PROMETHEUS._,"With not a god to vex my happy rule,"
231,_PROMETHEUS._,I would inhabit here and leave high heaven:
232,_PROMETHEUS._,"So much I love it and its race of men,"
233,_PROMETHEUS._,"Even as he hates them, hates both them, and me"
234,_PROMETHEUS._,"For loving what he hates, and would destroy me,                       30"
235,_PROMETHEUS._,"Outcast in the scorn of all his cringing crew,"
236,_PROMETHEUS._,For daring but to save what he would slay:
237,_PROMETHEUS._,And me must first destroy. Thus he denieth
238,_PROMETHEUS._,"My heart's wish, thus my counsel sets at naught,"
239,_PROMETHEUS._,"Which him saved once, when all at stake he stood"
240,_PROMETHEUS._,Uprisen in rebellion to overthrow
241,_PROMETHEUS._,"The elderseated Titans, for I that day"
242,_PROMETHEUS._,Gave him the counsels which his foes despised.
243,_PROMETHEUS._,"Unhappy they, who had still their blissful seats"
244,_PROMETHEUS._,"Preserved and their Olympian majesty,                                 40"
245,_PROMETHEUS._,"Had they been one with me. Alas, my kin!"
246,_PROMETHEUS._,"But he, when he had taken the throne and chained"
247,_PROMETHEUS._,"His foes in wasteful Tartarus, said no more"
248,_PROMETHEUS._,Where is Prometheus our wise counsellor?
249,_PROMETHEUS._,"What saith Prometheus? tell us, O Prometheus,"
250,_PROMETHEUS._,What Fate requires! but waxing confident
251,_PROMETHEUS._,"And wanton, as a youth first tasting power,"
252,_PROMETHEUS._,"He wrecked the timeless monuments of heaven,"
253,_PROMETHEUS._,"The witness of the wisdom of the gods,"
254,_PROMETHEUS._,"And making all about him new, beyond                                  50"
255,_PROMETHEUS._,"Determined to destroy the race of men,"
256,_PROMETHEUS._,And that create afresh or else have none.
257,_PROMETHEUS._,"Then his vain mind imagined a device,"
258,_PROMETHEUS._,And at his bidding all the opposÃ¨d winds
259,_PROMETHEUS._,"Blew, and the scattered clouds and furlÃ¨d snows,"
260,_PROMETHEUS._,"From every part of heaven together flying,"
261,_PROMETHEUS._,He with brute hands in huge disorder heaped:
262,_PROMETHEUS._,They with the winds' weight and his angry breath
263,_PROMETHEUS._,"Were thawed: in cataracts they fell, and earth"
264,_PROMETHEUS._,"In darkness deep and whelmÃ¨d tempest lay,                             60"
265,_PROMETHEUS._,Drowned 'neath the waters. Yet on the mountain-tops
266,_PROMETHEUS._,"Some few escaped, and some, thus warned by me,"
267,_PROMETHEUS._,Made shift to live in vessels which outrode
268,_PROMETHEUS._,The season and the fury of the flood.
269,_PROMETHEUS._,And when his rain was spent and from clear skies
270,_PROMETHEUS._,"Zeus looking down upon the watery world,"
271,_PROMETHEUS._,"Beheld these few, the remnant of mankind,"
272,_PROMETHEUS._,Who yet stood up and breathed; he next withdrew
273,_PROMETHEUS._,"The seeds of fire, that else had still lain hid"
274,_PROMETHEUS._,In withered branch and the blue flakes of flint                       70
275,_PROMETHEUS._,"For man to exact and use, but these withdrawn,"
276,_PROMETHEUS._,Man with the brutes degraded would be man
277,_PROMETHEUS._,No more; and so the tyrant was content.
278,_PROMETHEUS._,"But I, despised again, again upheld"
279,_PROMETHEUS._,"The weak, and pitying them sent sweet Hope,"
280,_PROMETHEUS._,"Bearer of dreams, enchantress fond and kind,"
281,_PROMETHEUS._,From heaven descending on the unhindered rays
282,_PROMETHEUS._,"Of every star, to cheer with visions fair"
283,_PROMETHEUS._,Their unamending pains. And now this day
284,_PROMETHEUS._,Behold I come bearing the seal of all                                 80
285,_PROMETHEUS._,Which Hope had promised: for within this reed
286,_PROMETHEUS._,"A prisoner I bring them stolen from heaven,"
287,_PROMETHEUS._,"The flash of mastering fire, and it have borne"
288,_PROMETHEUS._,"So swift to earth, that when yon noontide sun"
289,_PROMETHEUS._,"Rose from the sea at morning I was by,"
290,_PROMETHEUS._,And unperceived of HÃªlios plunged the point
291,_PROMETHEUS._,"I' the burning axle, and withdrew a tongue"
292,_PROMETHEUS._,"Of breathing flame, which lives to leap on earth"
293,_PROMETHEUS._,For man the father of all fire to come.
294,_PROMETHEUS._,And hither have I brought it even to Argos                          90
295,_PROMETHEUS._,"Unto king Inachus, him having chosen"
296,_PROMETHEUS._,Above all mortals to receive my gift:
297,_PROMETHEUS._,"For he is hopeful, careful, wise, and brave."
298,_PROMETHEUS._,"He first, when first the floods left bare the land,"
299,_PROMETHEUS._,"Grew warm with enterprise, and gathered men"
300,_PROMETHEUS._,"Together, and disposed their various tasks"
301,_PROMETHEUS._,For common weal combined; for soon were seen
302,_PROMETHEUS._,"The long straight channels dwindling on the plain,"
303,_PROMETHEUS._,Which slow from stagnant pool and wide morass
304,_PROMETHEUS._,The pestilent waters to the rivers bore:                             100
305,_PROMETHEUS._,Then in the ruined dwellings and old tombs
306,_PROMETHEUS._,"He dug, unbedding from the wormÃ¨d ooze"
307,_PROMETHEUS._,Vessels and tools of trade and husbandry;
308,_PROMETHEUS._,"Wherewith, all seasonable works restored,"
309,_PROMETHEUS._,"Oil made he and wine anew, and taught mankind"
310,_PROMETHEUS._,"To live not brutally though without fire,"
311,_PROMETHEUS._,"Tending their flocks and herds and weaving wool,"
312,_PROMETHEUS._,"Living on fruit and milk and shepherds' fare,"
313,_PROMETHEUS._,"Till time should bring back flame to smithy and hearth,"
314,_PROMETHEUS._,"Or Zeus relent. Now at these gates I stand,                          110"
315,_PROMETHEUS._,"At this mid hour, when Inachus comes forth"
316,_PROMETHEUS._,To offer sacrifice unto his foe.
317,_PROMETHEUS._,For never hath his faithful zeal forborne
318,_PROMETHEUS._,"To pay the power, though hard, that rules the world"
319,_PROMETHEUS._,The smokeless sacrifice; which first to-day
320,_PROMETHEUS._,"Shall smoke, and rise at heaven in flame to brave"
321,_PROMETHEUS._,The baffled god. See here a servant bears
322,_PROMETHEUS._,For the cold altar ceremonial wood:
323,_PROMETHEUS._,My shepherd's cloak will serve me for disguise.

328,_SERVANT._,
329,_SERVANT._,"PR. But toil brings health, and health is happiness."
330,_SERVANT._,
331,_SERVANT._,"SERV. Here's one I know not--nay, how came he here"
332,_SERVANT._,"Unseen by me? I pray thee, stranger, tell me"
333,_SERVANT._,What wouldst thou at the house of Inachus?
334,_SERVANT._,
335,_SERVANT._,"PR. Intruders, friend, and travellers have glib tongues,"
336,_SERVANT._,Silence will question such.
337,_SERVANT._,
338,_SERVANT._,"SERV.                       If 'tis a message,"
339,_SERVANT._,To-day is not thy day--who sent thee hither?
340,_SERVANT._,
341,_SERVANT._,PR. The business of my leisure was well guessed:
342,_SERVANT._,But he that sent me hither is I that come.
343,_SERVANT._,
344,_SERVANT._,SERV. I smell the matter--thou wouldst serve the house?
345,_SERVANT._,
346,_SERVANT._,PR. 'Twas for that very cause I fled my own.                         131
347,_SERVANT._,
348,_SERVANT._,SERV. From cruelty or fear of punishment?
349,_SERVANT._,
350,_SERVANT._,"PR. Cruel was my master, for he slew his father."
351,_SERVANT._,His punishments thou speakest of are crimes.
352,_SERVANT._,
353,_SERVANT._,SERV. Thou dost well flying one that slew his father.
354,_SERVANT._,
355,_SERVANT._,"PR. Thy lord, they say, is kind."
356,_SERVANT._,
357,_SERVANT._,"SERV.                            Well, thou wilt see"
358,_SERVANT._,"Thou may'st at once begin--come, give a hand."
359,_SERVANT._,
360,_SERVANT._,PR. A day of freedom is a day of pleasure:
361,_SERVANT._,"And what thou doest have I never done,"
362,_SERVANT._,And understanding not might mar thy work.                            140
363,_SERVANT._,
364,_SERVANT._,SERV. Ay true--there is a right way and a wrong
365,_SERVANT._,In laying wood.
366,_SERVANT._,
367,_SERVANT._,PR.    Then let me see thee lay it:
368,_SERVANT._,The sight of a skill'd hand will teach an art.
369,_SERVANT._,
370,_SERVANT._,"SERV. Thou seest this faggot which I now unbind,"
371,_SERVANT._,How it is packed within.
372,_SERVANT._,
373,_SERVANT._,PR.                      I see the cones
374,_SERVANT._,"And needles of the fir, which by the wind"
375,_SERVANT._,In melancholy places ceaselessly
376,_SERVANT._,Sighing are strewn upon the tufted floor.
377,_SERVANT._,
378,_SERVANT._,"SERV. These took I from a sheltered bank, whereon"
379,_SERVANT._,The sun looks down at noon; for there is need                        150
380,_SERVANT._,The things be dry. These first I spread; and then
381,_SERVANT._,Small sticks that snap i' the hand.
382,_SERVANT._,
383,_SERVANT._,PR.                                 Such are enough
384,_SERVANT._,"To burden the slow flight of labouring rooks,"
385,_SERVANT._,When on the leafless tree-tops in young March
386,_SERVANT._,Their glossy herds assembling soothe the air
387,_SERVANT._,With cries of solemn joy and cawings loud.
388,_SERVANT._,And such the long-necked herons will bear to mend
389,_SERVANT._,"Their airy platform, when the loving spring"
390,_SERVANT._,Bids them take thought for their expected young.
391,_SERVANT._,
392,_SERVANT._,SERV. See even so I cross them and cross them so:                    160
393,_SERVANT._,Larger and by degrees a steady stack
394,_SERVANT._,"Have built, whereon the heaviest logs may lie:"
395,_SERVANT._,And all of sun-dried wood: and now 'tis done.
396,_SERVANT._,
397,_SERVANT._,"PR. And now 'tis done, what means it now 'tis done?"
398,_SERVANT._,
399,_SERVANT._,"SERV. Well, thus 'tis rightly done: but why 'tis so"
400,_SERVANT._,"I cannot tell, nor any man here knows;"
401,_SERVANT._,"Save that our master when he sacrificeth,"
402,_SERVANT._,"As thou wilt hear anon, speaketh of fire;"
403,_SERVANT._,And fire he saith is good for gods and men;
404,_SERVANT._,And the gods have it and men have it not:                            170
405,_SERVANT._,And then he prays the gods to send us fire;
406,_SERVANT._,"And we, against they send it, must have wood"
407,_SERVANT._,Laid ready thus as I have shewn thee here.
408,_SERVANT._,
409,_SERVANT._,PR. To-day he sacrificeth?
410,_SERVANT._,
411,_SERVANT._,"SERV.                      Ay, this noon."
412,_SERVANT._,
413,_SERVANT._,Hark! hear'st thou not? they come. The solemn flutes
414,_SERVANT._,Warn us away; we must not here be seen
415,_SERVANT._,"In these our soilÃ¨d habits, yet may stand"
416,_SERVANT._,Where we may hear and see and not be seen.

442,_CHORUS._,"To the song of adoring love,"
443,_CHORUS._,With which the separate spheres
444,_CHORUS._,Are voicÃ¨d that turn above:
445,_CHORUS._,And all that is hidden under

450,_CHORUS._,_Semichorus of youths._

454,_CHORUS._,Above all mountains famous to me
455,_CHORUS._,Is Ida and crowned with glory.
456,_CHORUS._,There guarded of Heaven and Earth
457,_CHORUS._,Came Rhea at fall of night
458,_CHORUS._,To hide a wondrous birth
459,_CHORUS._,From the Sire's unfathering sight.                                   210
460,_CHORUS._,The halls of Cronos rang
461,_CHORUS._,"With omens of coming ill,"
462,_CHORUS._,And the mad CurÃªtes danced and sang
463,_CHORUS._,Adown the slopes of the hill.
464,_CHORUS._,
465,_CHORUS._,Then all the peaks of Gnossus kindled red
466,_CHORUS._,"Beckoning afar unto the sinking sun,"
467,_CHORUS._,"he thro' the vaporous west plunged to his bed,"
468,_CHORUS._,"Sunk, and the day was done."

471,_CHORUS._,"Hanging in air aloft,"
472,_CHORUS._,At eve from shadowed ship
473,_CHORUS._,The Egyptian sailor sees:
474,_CHORUS._,Or like the twofold tip
475,_CHORUS._,That o'er the topmost trees
476,_CHORUS._,"Flares on Parnassus, and the Theban dames"
477,_CHORUS._,Quake at the ghostly flames.
478,_CHORUS._,
479,_CHORUS._,Then friendly night arose
480,_CHORUS._,"To succour Earth, and spread"
481,_CHORUS._,Her mantle o'er the snows                                            230
482,_CHORUS._,And quenched their rosy red;
483,_CHORUS._,But in the east upsprings
484,_CHORUS._,"Another light on them,"
485,_CHORUS._,SelÃªnÃ© with white wings
486,_CHORUS._,And hueless diadem.
487,_CHORUS._,Little could she befriend

494,_CHORUS._,Stoop to the bitter North:
495,_CHORUS._,Or searching twice or thrice
496,_CHORUS._,"Along the rocky walls,"
497,_CHORUS._,She marks the columned ice
498,_CHORUS._,Of frozen waterfalls:
499,_CHORUS._,But still the darkened cave
500,_CHORUS._,"Grew darker as she shone,"
501,_CHORUS._,Wherein was Rhea gone                                                250
502,_CHORUS._,Her child to bear and save.

504,_CHORUS._,[_They dance._
505,_CHORUS._,

507,_CHORUS._,And drowned with yells the cries of mother and child;

509,_CHORUS._,And burly Acmon struck the echoes out:
510,_CHORUS._,And Kermis leaped and howled: and Titias pranced
511,_CHORUS._,And broad Cyllenus tore the air and danced:
512,_CHORUS._,While deep within the shadowed cave at rest
513,_CHORUS._,"Lay Rhea, with her babe upon her breast."

526,_INACHUS._,
527,_INACHUS._,_Semichorus of maidens._
528,_INACHUS._,
529,_INACHUS._,I have chosen to praise
530,_INACHUS._,"HÃªra the wife, and bring"
531,_INACHUS._,A hymn for the feast on marriage days                                270
532,_INACHUS._,To the wife of the gods' king.
533,_INACHUS._,How on her festival
534,_INACHUS._,"The gods had loving strife,"
535,_INACHUS._,Which should give of them all
536,_INACHUS._,The fairest gift to the wife.
537,_INACHUS._,"But Earth said, Fair to see"
538,_INACHUS._,"Is mine and yields to none,"
539,_INACHUS._,"I have grown for her joy a sacred tree,"
540,_INACHUS._,With apples of gold thereon.
541,_INACHUS._,
542,_INACHUS._,"Then HÃªra, when she heard what Earth had given,                    280"
543,_INACHUS._,"Smiled for her joy, and longed and came to see:"
544,_INACHUS._,"On dovewings flying from the height of heaven,"
545,_INACHUS._,Down to the golden tree:
546,_INACHUS._,As tired birds at even
547,_INACHUS._,Come flying straight to house
548,_INACHUS._,On their accustomed boughs.
549,_INACHUS._,"'Twas where, on tortured hands"
550,_INACHUS._,Bearing the mighty pole.
551,_INACHUS._,Devoted Atlas stands:
552,_INACHUS._,And round his bowed head roll                                        290
553,_INACHUS._,"Day-light and night, and stars unmingled dance,"
554,_INACHUS._,Nor can he raise his glance.
555,_INACHUS._,
556,_INACHUS._,She saw the rocky coast
557,_INACHUS._,Whereon the azured waves
558,_INACHUS._,"Are laced in foam, or lost"
559,_INACHUS._,In water-lighted caves;
560,_INACHUS._,"The olive island where,"
561,_INACHUS._,"Amid the purple seas,"
562,_INACHUS._,Night unto Darkness bare
563,_INACHUS._,The four Hesperides:                                                 300
564,_INACHUS._,And came into the shade
565,_INACHUS._,"Of Atlas, where she found"
566,_INACHUS._,The garden Earth had made
567,_INACHUS._,And fenced with groves around.
568,_INACHUS._,And in the midst it grew
569,_INACHUS._,"Alone, the priceless stem,"
570,_INACHUS._,"As careful, clear and true"
571,_INACHUS._,As graving on a gem.
572,_INACHUS._,Nature had kissÃ¨d Art
573,_INACHUS._,And borne a child to stir                                            310
574,_INACHUS._,With jealousy the heart
575,_INACHUS._,Of heaven's Artificer.
576,_INACHUS._,From crown to swelling root
577,_INACHUS._,"It mocked the goddess' praise,"
578,_INACHUS._,"The green enamelled sprays,"
579,_INACHUS._,The emblazoned golden fruit.
580,_INACHUS._,
581,_INACHUS._,[_They dance_

586,_INACHUS._,And Erytheia sang 'The tree is green!'                               320
587,_INACHUS._,And Hestia danced and sang 'The fruit is gold!'
588,_INACHUS._,"And Arethusa sang 'Fair Queen, behold!'"
589,_INACHUS._,"And all joined hands and danced about the tree,"
590,_INACHUS._,"And sang 'O Queen, we dance and sing for thee!'"
591,_INACHUS._,
592,_INACHUS._,IN. If there be any here who has complaint
593,_INACHUS._,"Against our rule or claim or supplication,"
594,_INACHUS._,"Now in the name of Zeus let it appear,"
595,_INACHUS._,Now let him speak!
596,_INACHUS._,
597,_INACHUS._,_Prometheus re-enters._
598,_INACHUS._,
599,_INACHUS._,"PR. All hail, most worthy king, such claim have I."
600,_INACHUS._,
601,_INACHUS._,"IN. May grace be with thee, stranger; speak thy mind."
602,_INACHUS._,
603,_INACHUS._,"PR. To Argos, king of Argos, at thy house                            331"
604,_INACHUS._,"I bring long journeying to an end this hour,"
605,_INACHUS._,Bearing no idle message for thine ears.
606,_INACHUS._,"For know that far thy fame has reached, and men"
607,_INACHUS._,That ne'er have seen thee tell that thou art set
608,_INACHUS._,"Upon the throne of virtue, that goodwill"
609,_INACHUS._,"And love thy servants are, that in thy land"
610,_INACHUS._,"Joy, honour, trust and modesty abide"
611,_INACHUS._,"And drink the air of peace, that kings must see"
612,_INACHUS._,"Thy city, would they know their peoples' good                        340"
613,_INACHUS._,And stablish them therein by wholesome laws.
614,_INACHUS._,"But one thing mars the tale, for o'er thy lands"
615,_INACHUS._,"Travelling I have not seen from morn till eve,"
616,_INACHUS._,"Either from house or farm or labourer's cot,"
617,_INACHUS._,"In any village, nor this town of Argos"
618,_INACHUS._,"A blue-wreathed smoke arise: the hearths are cold,"
619,_INACHUS._,This altar cold: I see the wood and cakes
620,_INACHUS._,"Unbaken--O king, where is the fire?"
621,_INACHUS._,
622,_INACHUS._,"IN. If hither, stranger, thou wert come to find"
623,_INACHUS._,"That which thou findest wanting, join with us                        350"
624,_INACHUS._,"Now in our sacrifice, take food within,"
625,_INACHUS._,And having learnt our simple way of life
626,_INACHUS._,Return unto thy country whence thou camest.
627,_INACHUS._,"But hast thou skill or knowledge of this thing,"
628,_INACHUS._,"How best it may be sought, or by what means"
629,_INACHUS._,"Hope to be reached, O speak! I wait to hear."
630,_INACHUS._,
631,_INACHUS._,"PR. There is, O king, fire on the earth this day."
632,_INACHUS._,
633,_INACHUS._,IN. On earth there is fire thou sayest!
634,_INACHUS._,
635,_INACHUS._,PR.                                     There is fire.
636,_INACHUS._,
637,_INACHUS._,IN. On earth this day!
638,_INACHUS._,
639,_INACHUS._,PR.                    There is fire on earth this day.
640,_INACHUS._,
641,_INACHUS._,"IN. This is a sacred place, a solemn hour,                           360"
642,_INACHUS._,"Thy speech is earnest: yet even if thou speak truth,"
643,_INACHUS._,"O welcome messenger of happy tidings,"
644,_INACHUS._,"And though I hear aright, yet to believe"
645,_INACHUS._,Is hard: thou canst not know what words thou speakest
646,_INACHUS._,Into what ears: they never heard before
647,_INACHUS._,"This sound but in old tales of happier times,"
648,_INACHUS._,In sighs of prayer and faint unhearted hope:
649,_INACHUS._,"Maybe they heard not rightly, speak again!"
650,_INACHUS._,
651,_INACHUS._,"PR. There is, O king, fire on the earth this day."
652,_INACHUS._,
653,_INACHUS._,"IN. Yes, yes, again. Now let sweet Music blab                        370"
654,_INACHUS._,Her secret and give o'er; here is a trumpet
655,_INACHUS._,That mocks her method. Yet 'tis but the word.
656,_INACHUS._,Maybe thy fire is not the fire I seek;
657,_INACHUS._,"Maybe though thou didst see it, now 'tis quenched,"
658,_INACHUS._,Or guarded out of reach: speak yet again
659,_INACHUS._,And swear by heaven's truth is there fire or no;
660,_INACHUS._,"And if there be, what means may make it mine."
661,_INACHUS._,
662,_INACHUS._,"PR. There is, O king, fire on the earth this day:"
663,_INACHUS._,But not as thou dost seek it to be found.
664,_INACHUS._,
665,_INACHUS._,IN. How seeking wrongly shall I seek aright?                         380
666,_INACHUS._,
667,_INACHUS._,"PR. Thou prayest here to Zeus, and him thou callest"
668,_INACHUS._,"Almighty, knowing he could grant thy prayer:"
669,_INACHUS._,"That if 'twere but his will, the journeying sun"
670,_INACHUS._,Might drop a spark into thine outstretched hand:
671,_INACHUS._,That at his breath the splashing mountain brooks
672,_INACHUS._,"That fall from OrneÃ¦, and cold LernÃ¨'s pool"
673,_INACHUS._,"Would change their element, and their chill streams"
674,_INACHUS._,Bend in their burning banks a molten flood:
675,_INACHUS._,That at his word so many messengers
676,_INACHUS._,"Would bring thee fire from heaven, that not a hearth                 390"
677,_INACHUS._,In all thy land but straight would have a god
678,_INACHUS._,"To kneel and fan the flame: and yet to him,"
679,_INACHUS._,It is to him thou prayest.
680,_INACHUS._,
681,_INACHUS._,IN.                        Therefore to him.
682,_INACHUS._,
683,_INACHUS._,"PR. Is this thy wisdom, king, to sow thy seed"
684,_INACHUS._,Year after year in this unsprouting soil?
685,_INACHUS._,Hast thou not proved and found the will of Zeus
686,_INACHUS._,A barren rock for man with prayer to plough?
687,_INACHUS._,
688,_INACHUS._,IN. His anger be averted! we judge not god
689,_INACHUS._,"Evil, because our wishes please him not."
690,_INACHUS._,Oft our shortsighted prayers to heaven ascending                     400
691,_INACHUS._,"Ask there our ruin, and are then denied"
692,_INACHUS._,"In kindness above granting: were 't not so,"
693,_INACHUS._,Scarce could we pray for fear to pluck our doom
694,_INACHUS._,Out of the merciful withholding hands.
695,_INACHUS._,
696,_INACHUS._,PR. Why then provokest thou such great goodwill
697,_INACHUS._,In long denial and kind silence shown?
698,_INACHUS._,
699,_INACHUS._,"IN. Fie, fie! Thou lackest piety: the god's denial"
700,_INACHUS._,"Being nought but kindness, there is hope that he"
701,_INACHUS._,Will make that good which is not:--or if indeed
702,_INACHUS._,"Good be withheld in punishment, 'tis well                            410"
703,_INACHUS._,Still to seek on and pray that god relent.
704,_INACHUS._,
705,_INACHUS._,"PR. O Sire of Argos, Zeus will not relent."
706,_INACHUS._,
707,_INACHUS._,IN. Yet fire thou say'st is on the earth this day.
708,_INACHUS._,
709,_INACHUS._,"PR. Not of his knowledge nor his gift, O king."
710,_INACHUS._,
711,_INACHUS._,IN. By kindness of what god then has man fire?
712,_INACHUS._,
713,_INACHUS._,PR. I say but on the earth unknown to Zeus.
714,_INACHUS._,
715,_INACHUS._,"IN. How boastest thou to know, not of his knowledge?"
716,_INACHUS._,
717,_INACHUS._,PR. I boast not: he that knoweth not may boast.
718,_INACHUS._,
719,_INACHUS._,IN. Thy daring words bewilder sense with sound.
720,_INACHUS._,
721,_INACHUS._,PR. I thought to find thee ripe for daring deeds.                    420
722,_INACHUS._,
723,_INACHUS._,IN. And what the deed for which I prove unripe?
724,_INACHUS._,
725,_INACHUS._,PR. To take of heaven's fire.
726,_INACHUS._,
727,_INACHUS._,"IN.                           And were I ripe,"
728,_INACHUS._,"What should I dare, beseech you?"
729,_INACHUS._,
730,_INACHUS._,PR.                              The wrath of Zeus.
731,_INACHUS._,
732,_INACHUS._,"IN. Madman, pretending in one hand to hold"
733,_INACHUS._,The wrath of god and in the other fire.
734,_INACHUS._,
735,_INACHUS._,PR. Thou meanest rather holding both in one.
736,_INACHUS._,
737,_INACHUS._,IN. Both impious art thou and incredible.
738,_INACHUS._,
739,_INACHUS._,PR. Yet impious only till thou dost believe.
740,_INACHUS._,
741,_INACHUS._,"IN. And what believe? Ah, if I could believe!"
742,_INACHUS._,"It was but now thou saidst that there was fire,                      430"
743,_INACHUS._,And I was near believing; I believed:
744,_INACHUS._,Now to believe were to be mad as thou.
745,_INACHUS._,
746,_INACHUS._,CHORUS. He may be mad and yet say true--maybe
747,_INACHUS._,The heat of prophecy like a strong wine
748,_INACHUS._,Shameth his reason with exultant speech.
749,_INACHUS._,
750,_INACHUS._,"PR. Thou say'st I am mad, and of my sober words"
751,_INACHUS._,"Hast called those impious which thou fearest true,"
752,_INACHUS._,"Those which thou knowest good, incredible."
753,_INACHUS._,Consider ere thou judge: be first assured
754,_INACHUS._,All is not good for man that seems god's will.                       440
755,_INACHUS._,"See, on thy farming skill, thy country toil"
756,_INACHUS._,"Which bends to aid the willing fruits of earth,"
757,_INACHUS._,"And would promote the seasonable year,"
758,_INACHUS._,The face of nature is not always kind:
759,_INACHUS._,And if thou search the sum of visible being
760,_INACHUS._,"To find thy blessing featured, 'tis not there:"
761,_INACHUS._,Her best gifts cannot brim the golden cup
762,_INACHUS._,Of expectation which thine eager arms
763,_INACHUS._,Lift to her mouthÃ¨d horn--what then is this
764,_INACHUS._,Whose wide capacity outbids the scale                                450
765,_INACHUS._,"Of prodigal beauty, so that the seeing eye"
766,_INACHUS._,"And hearing ear, retiring unamazed"
767,_INACHUS._,"Within their quiet chambers, sit to feast"
768,_INACHUS._,"With dear imagination, nor look forth"
769,_INACHUS._,As once they did upon the varying air?
770,_INACHUS._,Whence is the fathering of this desire
771,_INACHUS._,Which mocks at fated circumstance? nay though
772,_INACHUS._,"Obstruction lie as cumbrous as the mountains,"
773,_INACHUS._,Nor thy particular hap hath armed desire
774,_INACHUS._,"Against the brunt of evil,--yet not for this                         460"
775,_INACHUS._,Faints man's desire: it is the unquenchable
776,_INACHUS._,"Original cause, the immortal breath of being:"
777,_INACHUS._,"Nor is there any spirit on Earth astir,"
778,_INACHUS._,"Nor 'neath the airy vault, nor yet beyond"
779,_INACHUS._,"In any dweller in far-reaching space,"
780,_INACHUS._,Nobler or dearer than the spirit of man:
781,_INACHUS._,"That spirit which lives in each and will not die,"
782,_INACHUS._,"That wooeth beauty, and for all good things"
783,_INACHUS._,"Urgeth a voice, or in still passion sigheth,"
784,_INACHUS._,And where he loveth draweth the heart with him.                      470
785,_INACHUS._,"Hast thou not heard him speaking oft and oft,"
786,_INACHUS._,Prompting thy secret musings and now shooting
787,_INACHUS._,"His feathered fancies, or in cloudy sleep"
788,_INACHUS._,Piling his painted dreams? O hark to him!
789,_INACHUS._,For else if folly shut his joyous strength
790,_INACHUS._,"To mope in her dark prison without praise,"
791,_INACHUS._,The hidden tears with which he wails his wrong
792,_INACHUS._,Will sour the fount of life. O hark to him!
793,_INACHUS._,Him may'st thou trust beyond the things thou seest.
794,_INACHUS._,For many things there be upon this earth                             480
795,_INACHUS._,"Unblest and fallen from beauty, to mislead"
796,_INACHUS._,"Man's mind, and in a shadow justify"
797,_INACHUS._,The evil thoughts and deeds that work his ill;
798,_INACHUS._,"Fear, hatred, lust and strife, which, if man question"
799,_INACHUS._,"The heavenborn spirit within him, are not there."
800,_INACHUS._,"Yet are they bold of face, and Zeus himself,"
801,_INACHUS._,"Seeing that Mischief held her head on high,"
802,_INACHUS._,Lest she should go beyond his power to quell
803,_INACHUS._,And draw the inevitable Fate that waits
804,_INACHUS._,"On utmost ill, himself preventing Fate                               490"
805,_INACHUS._,"Hasted to drown the world, and now would crush"
806,_INACHUS._,Thy little remnant: but among the gods
807,_INACHUS._,Is one whose love and courage stir for thee;
808,_INACHUS._,"Who being of manlike spirit, by many shifts"
809,_INACHUS._,"Has stayed the hand of the enemy, who crieth"
810,_INACHUS._,"Thy world is not destroyed, thy good shall live:"
811,_INACHUS._,"Thou hast more power for good than Zeus for ill,"
812,_INACHUS._,"More courage, justice, more abundant art,"
813,_INACHUS._,"More love, more joy, more reason: though around thee"
814,_INACHUS._,"Rank-rooting evil bloom with poisonous crown,                        500"
815,_INACHUS._,Though wan and dolorous and crooked things
816,_INACHUS._,"Have made their home with thee, thy good shall live."
817,_INACHUS._,"Know thy desire: and know that if thou seek it,"
818,_INACHUS._,"And seek, and seek, and fear not, thou shall find."
819,_INACHUS._,
820,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_youths_). Is this a god that speaketh thus?
821,_INACHUS._,
822,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_maidens_). He speaketh as a man
823,_INACHUS._,In love or great affliction yields his soul.
824,_INACHUS._,
825,_INACHUS._,"IN. Thou, whencesoe'er thou comest, whoe'er thou art,"
826,_INACHUS._,Who breakest on our solemn sacrifice
827,_INACHUS._,"With solemn words, I pray thee not depart                            510"
828,_INACHUS._,Till thou hast told me more. This fire I seek
829,_INACHUS._,"Not for myself, whose thin and silvery hair"
830,_INACHUS._,"Tells that my toilsome age nears to its end,"
831,_INACHUS._,"But for my children and the aftertime,"
832,_INACHUS._,"For great the need thereof, wretched our state;"
833,_INACHUS._,"Nay, set by what has been, our happiness"
834,_INACHUS._,"Is very want, so that what now is not"
835,_INACHUS._,Is but the measure of what yet may be.
836,_INACHUS._,"And first are barest needs, which well I know"
837,_INACHUS._,"Fire would supply, but I have hope beyond,                           520"
838,_INACHUS._,That Nature in recovering her right
839,_INACHUS._,Would kinder prove to man who seeks to learn
840,_INACHUS._,Her secrets and unfold the cause of life.
841,_INACHUS._,"So tell me, if thou knowest, what is fire?"
842,_INACHUS._,"Doth earth contain it? or, since from the sun"
843,_INACHUS._,"Fire reaches us, since in the glimmering stars"
844,_INACHUS._,"And pallid moon, in lightning, and the glance"
845,_INACHUS._,Of tracking meteors that at nightfall show
846,_INACHUS._,How in the air a thousand sightless things
847,_INACHUS._,"Travel, and ever on their windswift course                           530"
848,_INACHUS._,"Flame when they list and into darkness go,--"
849,_INACHUS._,"Since in all these a fiery nature dwells,"
850,_INACHUS._,"Is fire an airy essence, a thing of heaven,"
851,_INACHUS._,"That, could we poise it, were an alien power"
852,_INACHUS._,"To make our wisdom less, our wonder more?"
853,_INACHUS._,
854,_INACHUS._,"PR. Thy wish to know is good, and happy is he"
855,_INACHUS._,Who thus from chance and change has launched his mind
856,_INACHUS._,To dwell for ever with undisturbÃ¨d truth.
857,_INACHUS._,This high ambition doth not prompt his hand
858,_INACHUS._,"To crime, his right and pleasure are not wronged                     540"
859,_INACHUS._,"By folly of his fellows, nor his eye"
860,_INACHUS._,Dimmed by the griefs that move the tears of men.
861,_INACHUS._,"Son of the earth, and citizen may be"
862,_INACHUS._,"Of Argos or of Athens and her laws,"
863,_INACHUS._,"But still the eternal nature, where he looks,"
864,_INACHUS._,"O'errules him with the laws which laws obey,"
865,_INACHUS._,And in her heavenly city enrols his heart.
866,_INACHUS._,
867,_INACHUS._,"IN. Thus ever have I held of happiness,"
868,_INACHUS._,"The child of heavenly truth, and thus have found it"
869,_INACHUS._,"In prayer and meditation and still thought,                          550"
870,_INACHUS._,And thus my peace of mind based on a floor
871,_INACHUS._,That doth not quaver like the joys of sense:
872,_INACHUS._,Those I possess enough in seeing my slaves
873,_INACHUS._,"And citizens enjoy, having myself"
874,_INACHUS._,Tasted for once and put their sweets away.
875,_INACHUS._,"But of that heavenly city, of which thou sayest"
876,_INACHUS._,"Her laws o'errule us, have I little learnt,"
877,_INACHUS._,For when my wandering spirit hath dared alone
878,_INACHUS._,"The unearthly terror of her voiceless halls,"
879,_INACHUS._,"She hath fallen from delight, and without guide                      560"
880,_INACHUS._,"Turned back, and from her errand fled for fear."
881,_INACHUS._,
882,_INACHUS._,"PR. Think not that thou canst all things know, nor deem"
883,_INACHUS._,Such knowledge happiness: the all-knowing Fates
884,_INACHUS._,"No pleasure have, who sit eternally"
885,_INACHUS._,"Spinning the unnumbered threads that Time hath woven,"
886,_INACHUS._,"And weaves, upgathering in his furthest house"
887,_INACHUS._,To store from sight; but what 'tis joy to learn
888,_INACHUS._,"Or use to know, that may'st thou ask of right."
889,_INACHUS._,
890,_INACHUS._,"IN. Then tell me, for thou knowest, what is fire?"
891,_INACHUS._,
892,_INACHUS._,"PR. Know then, O king, that this fair earth of men,                  570"
893,_INACHUS._,"The Olympus of the gods, and all the heavens"
894,_INACHUS._,Are lesser kingdoms of the boundless space
895,_INACHUS._,"Wherein Fate rules; they have their several times,"
896,_INACHUS._,"Their seasons and the limit of their thrones,"
897,_INACHUS._,And from the nature of eternal things
898,_INACHUS._,"Springing, themselves are changed; even as the trees"
899,_INACHUS._,"Or birds or beasts of earth, which now arise"
900,_INACHUS._,"To being, now in turn decay and die."
901,_INACHUS._,"The heaven and earth thou seest, for long were held"
902,_INACHUS._,"By Fire, a raging power, to whom the Fates                           580"
903,_INACHUS._,"Decreed a slow diminishing old age,"
904,_INACHUS._,"But to his daughter, who is that gentle goddess,"
905,_INACHUS._,"Queen of the clear and azure firmament,"
906,_INACHUS._,"In heaven called Hygra, but by mortals Air,"
907,_INACHUS._,"To her, the child of his slow doting years,"
908,_INACHUS._,"Was given a beauteous youth, not long to outlast"
909,_INACHUS._,"His life, but be the pride of his decay,"
910,_INACHUS._,And win to gentler sway his lost domains.
911,_INACHUS._,"And when the day of time arrived, when Air"
912,_INACHUS._,Took o'er from her decrepit sire the third                           590
913,_INACHUS._,"Of the Sun's kingdoms, the one-moonÃ¨d earth,"
914,_INACHUS._,Straight came she down to her inheritance.
915,_INACHUS._,Gaze on the sun with thine unshaded eye
916,_INACHUS._,And shrink from what she saw. Forests of fire
917,_INACHUS._,"Whose waving trunks, sucking their fuel, reared"
918,_INACHUS._,"In branched flame roaring, and their torrid shades"
919,_INACHUS._,Aye underlit with fire. The mountains lifted
920,_INACHUS._,"And fell and followed like a running sea,"
921,_INACHUS._,And from their swelling flanks spumed froth of fire;
922,_INACHUS._,"Or, like awakening monsters, mighty mounds                           600"
923,_INACHUS._,Rose on the plain awhile.
924,_INACHUS._,
925,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_maidens_).         He discovers a foe.
926,_INACHUS._,
927,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_youths_). An enemy he paints.
928,_INACHUS._,
929,_INACHUS._,"PR.                                  These all she quenched,"
930,_INACHUS._,Or charmed their fury into the dens and bowels
931,_INACHUS._,"Of earth to smoulder, there the vital heat"
932,_INACHUS._,"To hold for her creation, which then--to her aid"
933,_INACHUS._,"Summoning high Reason from his home in heaven,--"
934,_INACHUS._,She wrought anew upon the temperate lands.
935,_INACHUS._,
936,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_maidens_). 'Twas well Air won this kingdom of her sire.
937,_INACHUS._,
938,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_youths_). Now say how made she green this home of fire.
939,_INACHUS._,
940,_INACHUS._,"PR. The waters first she brought, that in their streams"
941,_INACHUS._,And pools and seas innumerable things                                611
942,_INACHUS._,"Brought forth, from whence she drew the fertile seeds"
943,_INACHUS._,"Of trees and plants, and last of footed life,"
944,_INACHUS._,"That wandered forth, and roaming to and fro,"
945,_INACHUS._,The rejoicing earth peopled with living sound.
946,_INACHUS._,"Reason advised, and Reason praised her toil;"
947,_INACHUS._,"Which when she had done she gave him thanks, and said,"
948,_INACHUS._,"'Fair comrade, since thou praisest what is done,"
949,_INACHUS._,Grant me this favour ere thou part from me:
950,_INACHUS._,"Make thou one fair thing for me, which shall suit                    620"
951,_INACHUS._,"With what is made, and be the best of all.'"
952,_INACHUS._,"'Twas evening, and that night Reason made man."
953,_INACHUS._,
954,_INACHUS._,"SEM. (_maidens_). Children of Air are we, and live by fire."
955,_INACHUS._,
956,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_youths_). The sons of Reason dwelling on the earth.
957,_INACHUS._,
958,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_maidens_). Folk of a pleasant kingdom held between
959,_INACHUS._,Fire's reign of terror and the latter day
960,_INACHUS._,"When dying, soon in turn his child must die."
961,_INACHUS._,
962,_INACHUS._,"SEM. (_youths_). Having a wise creator, above time"
963,_INACHUS._,"Or youth or change, from whom our kind inherit"
964,_INACHUS._,The grace and pleasure of the eternal gods.                          630
965,_INACHUS._,
966,_INACHUS._,IN. But how came gods to rule this earth of Air?
967,_INACHUS._,
968,_INACHUS._,"PR. They also were her children who first ruled,"
969,_INACHUS._,"Cronos, Iapetus, HypÃ©rion,"
970,_INACHUS._,"Theia and Rhea, and other mighty names"
971,_INACHUS._,"That are but names--whom Zeus drave out from heaven,"
972,_INACHUS._,And with his tribe sits on their injured thrones.
973,_INACHUS._,
974,_INACHUS._,IN. There is no greater god in heaven than he.
975,_INACHUS._,
976,_INACHUS._,PR. Nor none more cruel nor more tyrannous.
977,_INACHUS._,
978,_INACHUS._,IN. But what can man against the power of god?
979,_INACHUS._,
980,_INACHUS._,PR. Doth not man strive with him? thyself dost pray.
981,_INACHUS._,
982,_INACHUS._,IN. That he may pardon our contrarious deeds.                        641
983,_INACHUS._,
984,_INACHUS._,"PR. Alas! Alas! what more contrarious deed,"
985,_INACHUS._,"What greater miracle of wrong than this,"
986,_INACHUS._,That man should know his good and take it not?
987,_INACHUS._,To what god wilt thou pray to pardon this?
988,_INACHUS._,"In vain was reason given, if man therewith"
989,_INACHUS._,"Shame truth, and name it wisdom to cry down"

994,_INACHUS._,And will not turn his head.

996,_INACHUS._,IN.                         How mean'st thou this?
997,_INACHUS._,
998,_INACHUS._,"PR. Thou hast desired the good, and now canst feel"
999,_INACHUS._,How hard it is to kill the heart's desire.
1000,_INACHUS._,
1001,_INACHUS._,"IN. Shall Inachus rise against Zeus, as he"
1002,_INACHUS._,Rose against Cronos and made war in heaven?
1003,_INACHUS._,
1004,_INACHUS._,"PR. I say not so, yet, if thou didst rebel,"
1005,_INACHUS._,The tongue that counselled Zeus should counsel thee.
1006,_INACHUS._,
1007,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_maidens_). This is strange counsel.
1008,_INACHUS._,
1009,_INACHUS._,SEM. (_youths_).                           He is not
1010,_INACHUS._,A counsellor for gods or men.                                        660
1011,_INACHUS._,
1012,_INACHUS._,"IN. O that I knew where I might counsel find,"
1013,_INACHUS._,"That one were sent, nay, were't the least of all"
1014,_INACHUS._,"The myriad messengers of heaven, to me!"
1015,_INACHUS._,"One that should say 'This morn I stood with Zeus,"
1016,_INACHUS._,"He hath heard thy prayer and sent me: ask a boon,"
1017,_INACHUS._,"What thing thou wilt, it shall be given thee.'"
1018,_INACHUS._,
1019,_INACHUS._,PR. What wouldst thou say to such a messenger?
1020,_INACHUS._,
1021,_INACHUS._,"IN. No need to ask then what I now might ask,"
1022,_INACHUS._,"How 'tis the gods, if they have care for mortals,"
1023,_INACHUS._,"Slubber our worst necessities--and the boon,                         670"
1024,_INACHUS._,No need to tell him that.
1025,_INACHUS._,
1026,_INACHUS._,"PR.                       Now, king, thou seest"
1027,_INACHUS._,"Zeus sends no messenger, but I am here."
1028,_INACHUS._,
1029,_INACHUS._,"IN. Thy speech is hard, and even thy kindest words"
1030,_INACHUS._,"Unkind. If fire thou hast, in thee 'tis kind"
1031,_INACHUS._,To proffer it: but thou art more unkind
1032,_INACHUS._,"Yoking heaven's wrath therewith. Nay, and how knowest thou"
1033,_INACHUS._,Zeus will be angry if I take of it?
1034,_INACHUS._,"Thou art a prophet: ay, but of the prophets"
1035,_INACHUS._,"Some have been taken in error, and honest time"
1036,_INACHUS._,Has honoured many with forgetfulness.                                680
1037,_INACHUS._,I'll make this proof of thee; Show me thy fire--
1038,_INACHUS._,"Nay, give't me now--if thou be true at all,"
1039,_INACHUS._,"Be true so far: for the rest there's none will lose,"
1040,_INACHUS._,Nor blame thee being false--where is thy fire?
1041,_INACHUS._,
1042,_INACHUS._,"PR. O rather, had it thus been mine to give,"
1043,_INACHUS._,I would have given it thus: not adding aught
1044,_INACHUS._,Of danger or diminishment or loss;
1045,_INACHUS._,So strong is my goodwill; nor less than this
1046,_INACHUS._,"My knowledge, but in knowledge all my power."
1047,_INACHUS._,Yet since wise guidance with a little means                          690
1048,_INACHUS._,"Can more than force unminded, I have skill"
1049,_INACHUS._,To conjure evil and outcompass strength.
1050,_INACHUS._,"Now give I thee my best, a little gift"

1120,_INACHUS._,"Nay, all her loveliest places are but grounds"

1122,_INACHUS._,True square and careful compass he may come
1123,_INACHUS._,"To plan and plant and spread abroad his towers,"
1124,_INACHUS._,"His gardens, temples, palaces and tombs."
1125,_INACHUS._,"And yet not all thou seest, with trancÃ¨d eye"
1126,_INACHUS._,"Looking upon the beauty that shall be,"

1370,_ARGEIA._,"He heard his hounds give tongue, that through the wood"

1375,_ARGEIA._,"Watching at hand, from his disguise arose."

1377,_ARGEIA._,Around their impious feast and slew them all:
1378,_ARGEIA._,"AlcyonÃ¨ and Ceyx, queen and king,"
1379,_ARGEIA._,Who for their arrogance were changed to birds:                       960
1380,_ARGEIA._,"And Cadmus now a serpent, once a king:"
1381,_ARGEIA._,"And saddest Niobe, whom not the love"

2125,_HADES._,"Its radiant revelry and ambrosial feast,"
2126,_HADES._,"Nor blamed our mighty Sisters, that not one"
2127,_HADES._,Would share my empire in the shades of night.
2128,_HADES._,"But when a younger race of gods arose,"
2129,_HADES._,"And Zeus set many sons on heav'nly seats,"
2130,_HADES._,"And many daughters dower'd with new domain,                           10"
2131,_HADES._,And year by year were multiply'd on earth
2132,_HADES._,"Their temples and their statu'd sanctities,"
2133,_HADES._,"Mirrors of man's ideas that grow apace,"
2134,_HADES._,"Yea, since man's mind was one with my desire"
2135,_HADES._,"That Hell should have a queen,--for heav'n hath queens"
2136,_HADES._,"Many, nor on all earth reigns any king"
2137,_HADES._,"In unkind isolation like to me,--"
2138,_HADES._,I claimed from Zeus that of the fair immortals
2139,_HADES._,One should be given to me to grace my throne.
2140,_HADES._,"Willing he was, and quick to praise my rule,                        20"
2141,_HADES._,And of mere justice there had granted me
2142,_HADES._,"Whome'er I chose: but 'Brother mine,' he said,"
2143,_HADES._,"'Great as my power among the gods, this thing"
2144,_HADES._,"I cannot compass, that a child of mine,"
2145,_HADES._,"Who once hath tasted of celestial life,"
2146,_HADES._,"Should all forgo, and destitute of bliss"
2147,_HADES._,"Descend into the shades, albeit to sit"
2148,_HADES._,An equal on thy throne. Take whom thou wilt;
2149,_HADES._,"But by triumphant force persuade, as erst"
2150,_HADES._,I conquer'd heav'n.' Said I 'My heart is set:                         30
2151,_HADES._,I take Demeter's child Persephone;
2152,_HADES._,Dost thou consent?' Whereto he gave his nod.
2153,_HADES._,"And I am come to-day with hidden powers,"
2154,_HADES._,"Ev'n unto Enna's fair Sicilian field,"
2155,_HADES._,To rob her from the earth. 'Tis here she wanders
2156,_HADES._,With all her train: nor is this flow'ry vale
2157,_HADES._,"Fairer among the fairest vales of earth,"
2158,_HADES._,Nor any flower within this flow'ry vale
2159,_HADES._,"Fair above other flowers, as she is fairest"
2160,_HADES._,"Among immortal goddesses, the daughter                                40"
2161,_HADES._,Of gentle-eyed Demeter; and her passion
2162,_HADES._,"Is for the flowers, and every tenderness"
2163,_HADES._,That I have long'd for in my fierce abodes.
2164,_HADES._,But she hath always in attendant guard
2165,_HADES._,"The dancing nymphs of Ocean, and to-day"
2166,_HADES._,The wise Athena and chaste Artemis
2167,_HADES._,"Indulge her girlish fancy, gathering flowers"
2168,_HADES._,"To deck the banner of my golden brother,"
2169,_HADES._,"Whose thought they guess not, tho' their presence here"
2170,_HADES._,Affront his will and mine. If once alone                              50
2171,_HADES._,"I spy her, I can snatch her swiftly down:"
2172,_HADES._,"And after shall find favour for my fault,"
2173,_HADES._,When I by gentle means have won her love.
2174,_HADES._,I hear their music now. Hither they come:
2175,_HADES._,I'll to my ambush in the rocky cave.      [_Exit._

2324,_ARTEMIS._,"With dark reserve, or poisoning all delite"
2325,_ARTEMIS._,Drives him upon his knees in tearful prayer

2327,_ARTEMIS._,"At his reiterated plaint grows wrath,"
2328,_ARTEMIS._,And burdens with fresh curse the curse of care.
2329,_ARTEMIS._,And they that haunt with men are apt to take

2340,_ARTEMIS._,"--Thy miracles of beauty above praise,--"
2341,_ARTEMIS._,"Are wither'd in the moment of their glory,"
2342,_ARTEMIS._,So that of all the mounting summer's wealth
2343,_ARTEMIS._,"The show is chang'd each day, and each day dies,"
2344,_ARTEMIS._,Of no more count in Nature's estimate

2348,_ARTEMIS._,"Ages ere he beheld it, and will play"
2349,_ARTEMIS._,For ages after him;--alike 'tis sad
2350,_ARTEMIS._,To read how beauty dies and he must die.
2351,_ARTEMIS._,
2352,_ARTEMIS._,"PER. Were I a man, I would not worship thee,"
2353,_ARTEMIS._,"Thou cold essential wisdom. If, as thou say'st,"
2354,_ARTEMIS._,"Thought makes men sorrowful, why help his thought"
2355,_ARTEMIS._,"To quench enjoyment, who might else as I"
2356,_ARTEMIS._,"Revel among bright things, and feast his sense"
2357,_ARTEMIS._,"With beauty well-discern'd? Nay, why came ye"
2358,_ARTEMIS._,To share my pastime? Ye love not the flowers.                        190
2359,_ARTEMIS._,
2360,_ARTEMIS._,"ATH. Indeed I love thee, child; and love thy flowers,--"
2361,_ARTEMIS._,"Nor less for loving wisely. All emotions,"
2362,_ARTEMIS._,"Whether of gods or men, all loves and passions,"
2363,_ARTEMIS._,"Are of two kinds; they are either inform'd by wisdom,"
2364,_ARTEMIS._,"To reason obedient,--or they are unconducted,"
2365,_ARTEMIS._,Flames of the burning life. The brutes of earth
2366,_ARTEMIS._,And Pan their master know these last; the first
2367,_ARTEMIS._,Are seen in me: betwixt the extremes there lie
2368,_ARTEMIS._,Innumerable alloys and all of evil.
2369,_ARTEMIS._,
2370,_ARTEMIS._,"PER. Nay, and I guess your purpose with me well:                     200"
2371,_ARTEMIS._,"I am a child, and ye would nurse me up"
2372,_ARTEMIS._,A pupil in your school. I know ye twain
2373,_ARTEMIS._,Of all the immortals are at one in this;
2374,_ARTEMIS._,Ye wage of cold disdain a bitter feud
2375,_ARTEMIS._,"With Aphrodite, and ye fear for me,"
2376,_ARTEMIS._,Lest she should draw me to her wanton way.
2377,_ARTEMIS._,Fear not: my party is taken. Hark! I'll tell
2378,_ARTEMIS._,"What I have chosen, what mankind shall hold"
2379,_ARTEMIS._,Devote and consecrate to me on earth:
2380,_ARTEMIS._,It is the flowers: but only among the flowers                        210
2381,_ARTEMIS._,"Those that men love for beauty, scent, or hue,"
2382,_ARTEMIS._,Having no other uses: I have found
2383,_ARTEMIS._,"Demeter, my good mother, heeds them not.--"
2384,_ARTEMIS._,"She loves vines, olives, orchards, 'the rich leas"
2385,_ARTEMIS._,"Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas,[1]"
2386,_ARTEMIS._,But for the idle flowers she hath little care:
2387,_ARTEMIS._,"She will resign them willingly. And think not,"
2388,_ARTEMIS._,"Thou wise Athena, I shall go unhonour'd,"
2389,_ARTEMIS._,Or rank a meaner goddess unto man.
2390,_ARTEMIS._,"His spirit setteth beauty before wisdom,                             220"
2391,_ARTEMIS._,"Pleasures above necessities, and thus"
2392,_ARTEMIS._,He ever adoreth flowers. Nor this I guess
2393,_ARTEMIS._,Where rich men only and superfluous kings
2394,_ARTEMIS._,Around their palaces reform the land
2395,_ARTEMIS._,"To terraces and level lawns, whereon"
2396,_ARTEMIS._,"Appointed slaves are told, to tend and feed"
2397,_ARTEMIS._,Lilies and roses and all rarest plants
2398,_ARTEMIS._,Fetch'd from all lands; that they--these lordly men--
2399,_ARTEMIS._,'Twixt flaunting avenues and wafted odours

2401,_ARTEMIS._,"This first they do: and after, it may be,"
2402,_ARTEMIS._,Within their garden set their academe:--
2403,_ARTEMIS._,"But in the poorest villages, around"
2404,_ARTEMIS._,"The meanest cottage, where no other solace"
2405,_ARTEMIS._,"Comforts the eye, some simple gaiety"
2406,_ARTEMIS._,"Of flowers in tended garden is seen; some pinks,"
2407,_ARTEMIS._,"Tulips, or crocuses that edge the path;"
2408,_ARTEMIS._,Where oft at eve the grateful labourer
2409,_ARTEMIS._,"Sits in his jasmin'd porch, and takes the sun:"
2410,_ARTEMIS._,"And even the children, that half-naked go,                           240"
2411,_ARTEMIS._,"Have posies in their hands, and of themselves"
2412,_ARTEMIS._,"Will choose a queen in whom to honour Spring,"
2413,_ARTEMIS._,Dancing before her garlanded with may.

2415,_ARTEMIS._,The hour of hunger and their homely feast
2416,_ARTEMIS._,"So they may cull the delicate primrose,"
2417,_ARTEMIS._,Sealing their birthright with the touch of beauty;
2418,_ARTEMIS._,With unconsider'd hecatombs assuring
2419,_ARTEMIS._,Their dim sense of immortal mystery.--
2420,_ARTEMIS._,"Yea, rich and poor, from cradle unto grave                           250"

2461,_ARTEMIS._,"While others are so strict? This six-leaved tulip,"
2462,_ARTEMIS._,"--He would not risk a seventh for all his worth,--"
2463,_ARTEMIS._,He thought to attain unique magnificence
2464,_ARTEMIS._,By sheer simplicity--a pointed oval
2465,_ARTEMIS._,"Bare on a stalk erect: and yet, grown old"
2466,_ARTEMIS._,"He will his young idea quite abandon,"
2467,_ARTEMIS._,In his dishevel'd fury wantoning
2468,_ARTEMIS._,Beyond belief.... Some are four-leaved: this poppy
2469,_ARTEMIS._,"Will have but four. He, like a hurried thief,"
2470,_ARTEMIS._,Stuffs his rich silks into too small a bag--                         280
2471,_ARTEMIS._,I think he watch'd a summer-butterfly
2472,_ARTEMIS._,"Creep out all crumpled from his winter-case,"
2473,_ARTEMIS._,Trusting the sun to smooth his tender tissue
2474,_ARTEMIS._,And sleek the velvet of his painted wings:--
2475,_ARTEMIS._,"And so doth he.--Between such different schemes,"
2476,_ARTEMIS._,"Such widely varied loveliness, how choose?"
2477,_ARTEMIS._,"Yet loving all, one should be most belov'd,"
2478,_ARTEMIS._,Most intimately mine; to mortal men
2479,_ARTEMIS._,My emblem: tho' I never find in one
2480,_ARTEMIS._,The sum of all distinctions.--Rose were best:                        290
2481,_ARTEMIS._,"But she is passion's darling, and unkind"
2482,_ARTEMIS._,"To handle--set her by.--Choosing for odour,"
2483,_ARTEMIS._,"The violet were mine--men call her modest,"
2484,_ARTEMIS._,"Because she hides, and when in company"
2485,_ARTEMIS._,Lacks manner and the assertive style of worth:--
2486,_ARTEMIS._,"While this narcissus here scorns modesty,"
2487,_ARTEMIS._,"Will stand up what she is, tho' something prim:"
2488,_ARTEMIS._,"Her scent, a saturation of one tone,"
2489,_ARTEMIS._,"Like her plain symmetry, leaves nought to fancy:--"
2490,_ARTEMIS._,"Whereas this iris,--she outvieth man's                               300"
2491,_ARTEMIS._,Excellent artistry; elaboration
2492,_ARTEMIS._,"Confounded with simplicity, till none"
2493,_ARTEMIS._,Can tell which sprang of which. Coud I but find
2494,_ARTEMIS._,"A scented iris, I should be content:"
2495,_ARTEMIS._,Yet men would call me proud: Iris is Pride.--
2496,_ARTEMIS._,"To-day I'll favour thee, sweet violet;"
2497,_ARTEMIS._,Thou canst live in my bosom. I'll not wrong thee
2498,_ARTEMIS._,Wearing thee in Olympus.--Help! help! Ay me!

2621,II,We in flower-gathering dance and idle song

2668,II,Nor yet at daybreak on the meads
2669,II,Where bountiful Symaethus leads
2670,II,His chaunting boatmen to the main;
2671,II,Nor where the road on Hybla's plain
2672,II,Is skirted by the spacious corn;
2673,II,Nor where embattled Syracuse
2674,II,With lustrous temple fronts the morn;
2675,II,Nor yet by dolphin'd Arethuse;

2725,II,"That Zeus should be destroy'd, or thou destroy him?"

2729,II,"CH. We pray thee, Lady, sit thou on this bank"
2730,II,"And we will bring thee food; or if thou thirst,"
2731,II,Water. We know too in what cooling caves
2732,II,The sly Fauns have bestow'd their skins of wine.
2733,II,
2734,II,"DEM. Ye simple creatures, I need not these things,"
2735,II,And stand above your pity. Think ye me
2736,II,A woman of the earth derang'd with grief?
2737,II,"Nay, nay: but I have pity on your pity,                              480"
2738,II,And for your kindness I will ease the trouble
2739,II,Wherewith it wounds your gentleness: attend!

2749,II,A crown she weareth.--She was never wont
2750,II,Thus ...--nor her robe thus--and her countenance
2751,II,Hath not the smile which drew us from the sea.
2752,II,
2753,II,"DEM. Daedalus cut it, in the year he made"
2754,II,"The Zibian Aphrodite, and Hephaestus                                 490"
2755,II,O'erlookt and praised the work. I treasure it
2756,II,"Beyond all other jewels that I have,"
2757,II,And on this chain I guard it. Say now: think ye
2758,II,It cannot fall loose until every link
2759,II,"Of all the chain be broken, or if one"
2760,II,"Break, will it fall?"
2761,II,
2762,II,"CH.                  Surely if one break, Lady,"
2763,II,The chain is broken and the jewel falls.
2764,II,
2765,II,DEM. 'Tis so. Now hearken diligently. All life

2769,II,Exhale their being; and on them the brutes
2770,II,"Feeding elaborate their sentient life,"
2771,II,And from these twain mankind; and in mankind
2772,II,A spirit lastly is form'd of subtler sort
2773,II,"Whereon the high gods live, sustain'd thereby,"
2774,II,"And feeding on it, as plants on the soil,"
2775,II,"Or animals on plants. Now see! I hold,"
2776,II,"As well ye know, one whole link of this chain:"
2777,II,"If I should kill the plants, must not man perish?                    510"
2778,II,"And if he perish, then the gods must die."
2779,II,
2780,II,"CH. If this were so, thou wouldst destroy thyself."
2781,II,
2782,II,DEM. And therefore Zeus will not believe my word.
2783,II,
2784,II,"CH. Nor we believe thee, Lady: it cannot be"
2785,II,That thou shouldst seek to mend a private fortune
2786,II,"By universal ruin, and restore"
2787,II,Thy daughter by destruction of thyself.
2788,II,

2796,II,The unweeting passions that I fondly nurtured
2797,II,"To hopes of glory, the young confidence"
2798,II,In growing happiness? Shall I throw by
2799,II,"As self-delusion the supreme ambition,"
2800,II,Which I encourag'd till parental fondness
2801,II,"Bore the prophetic blessing, on whose truth                          530"
2802,II,"My spirit throve? Oh never! nay, nay, nay!"
2803,II,"That were the one disaster, and if aid"
2804,II,"I cannot, I can mightily avenge."
2805,II,On irremediable wrong I shrink not
2806,II,"To pile immortal ruin, there to lie"
2807,II,As trophies on a carven tomb: nor less
2808,II,"For that no memory of my deed survive,"
2809,II,"Nor any eye to see, nor tongue to tell."
2810,II,
2811,II,"CH. So vast injustice, Lady, were not good."
2812,II,
2813,II,DEM. To you I seem unjust involving man.                             540
2814,II,
2815,II,CH. Why should man suffer in thy feud with Zeus?
2816,II,
2817,II,DEM. Let Zeus relent. There is no other way.
2818,II,I will destroy the seeds of plant and tree:
2819,II,"Vineyard and orchard, oliveyard and cornland"
2820,II,"Shall all withhold their fruits, and in their stead"
2821,II,Shall flourish the gay blooms that Cora loved.
2822,II,"There shall be dearth, and yet so gay the dearth"
2823,II,That all the land shall look in holiday
2824,II,With mockery of foison; every field
2825,II,With splendour aflame. For wheat the useless poppy                   550
2826,II,In sheeted scarlet; and for barley and oats
2827,II,"The blue and yellow weeds that mock men's toil,"
2828,II,Centaury and marigold in chequer'd plots:
2829,II,"Where seed is sown, or none, shall dandelions"
2830,II,"And wretched ragwort vie, orchis and iris"
2831,II,"And garish daisy, and for every flower"

2846,II,'Gainst destiny ordain'd idly revolting.

3065,_ODE._,While men might find distraction for their sorrows
3066,_ODE._,"In useful toil. Then, of my pity rather                              740"
3067,_ODE._,"Than hope to find their simple cure my own,"

3077,_ODE._,"Under an olive-tree, likening myself"
3078,_ODE._,"Outwardly to some kindly-hearted matron,"
3079,_ODE._,Whose wisdom and experience are of worth                             750
3080,_ODE._,Either where childhood clamorously speaks
3081,_ODE._,"The engrossing charge of Aphrodite's gifts,"
3082,_ODE._,Or merry maidens in wide-echoing halls
3083,_ODE._,"Want sober governance;--to me, as there"
3084,_ODE._,"I sat, the daughters of King Keleos came,"
3085,_ODE._,"Tall noble damsels, as kings' daughters are,"
3086,_ODE._,"And, marking me a stranger, they drew from me"
3087,_ODE._,"A tale told so engagingly, that they"
3088,_ODE._,Grew fain to find employment for my skill;
3089,_ODE._,"--As men devise in mutual recompense,                                760"
3090,_ODE._,Hoping the main advantage for themselves;--
3091,_ODE._,"And so they bad me follow, and I enter'd"
3092,_ODE._,"The palace of King Keleos, and received"
3093,_ODE._,"There on my knees the youngest of the house,"
3094,_ODE._,"A babe, to nurse him as a mother would:"
3095,_ODE._,And in that menial service I was proud
3096,_ODE._,To outrun duty and trust: and there I liv'd
3097,_ODE._,Disguised among the maidens many months.
3098,_ODE._,
3099,_ODE._,"CH. Often as have our guesses aim'd, dear Lady,"
3100,_ODE._,"Where thou didst hide thyself, oft as we wonder'd                    770"
3101,_ODE._,"What chosen work was thine, none ever thought"
3102,_ODE._,That thou didst deign to tend a mortal babe.
3103,_ODE._,
3104,_ODE._,DEM. What life I led shall be for men to tell.
3105,_ODE._,"But for this babe, the nursling of my sorrow,"
3106,_ODE._,"Whose peevish cry was my consoling care,"
3107,_ODE._,How much I came to love him ye shall hear.
3108,_ODE._,
3109,_ODE._,"CH. What was he named, Lady?"
3110,_ODE._,
3111,_ODE._,DEM.                         DemophoÃ¶n.
3112,_ODE._,"Yea, ye shall hear how much I came to love him."
3113,_ODE._,For in his small epitome I read
3114,_ODE._,The trouble of mankind; in him I saw                                 780
3115,_ODE._,"The hero's helplessness, the countless perils"
3116,_ODE._,"In ambush of life's promise, the desire"
3117,_ODE._,"Blind and instinctive, and the will perverse."
3118,_ODE._,His petty needs were man's necessities;
3119,_ODE._,"In him I nurst all mortal natur', embrac'd"
3120,_ODE._,"With whole affection to my breast, and lull'd"
3121,_ODE._,Wailing humanity upon my knee.
3122,_ODE._,
3123,_ODE._,CH. We see thou wilt not now destroy mankind.
3124,_ODE._,
3125,_ODE._,DEM. What I coud do to save man was my thought.
3126,_ODE._,"And, since my love was center'd in the boy,                          790"
3127,_ODE._,"My thought was first for him, to rescue him;"
3128,_ODE._,"That, thro' my providence, he ne'er should know"
3129,_ODE._,"Suffering, nor disease, nor fear of death."
3130,_ODE._,"Therefore I fed him on immortal food,"
3131,_ODE._,"And should have gain'd my wish, so well he throve,"
3132,_ODE._,"But by ill-chance it hapt, once, as I held him"
3133,_ODE._,"Bathed in the fire at midnight (as was my wont),--"
3134,_ODE._,"His mother stole upon us, and ascare"
3135,_ODE._,"At the strange sight, screaming in loud dismay"
3136,_ODE._,"Compel'd me to unmask, and leave for ever                            800"
3137,_ODE._,"The halls of Keleos, and my work undone."
3138,_ODE._,
3139,_ODE._,CH. 'Twas pity that she came!--Didst thou not grieve to lose
3140,_ODE._,The small DemophoÃ¶n?--Coudst thou not save him?
3141,_ODE._,
3142,_ODE._,DEM. I had been blinded. Think ye for yourselves ...
3143,_ODE._,What vantage were it to mankind at large
3144,_ODE._,"That one should be immortal,--if all beside"
3145,_ODE._,Must die and suffer misery as before?
3146,_ODE._,
3147,_ODE._,"CH. Nay, truly. And great envy borne to one"
3148,_ODE._,So favour'd might have more embitter'd all.
3149,_ODE._,
3150,_ODE._,DEM. I had been foolish. My sojourn with men                         810
3151,_ODE._,Had warpt my mind with mortal tenderness.
3152,_ODE._,"So, questioning myself what real gift"
3153,_ODE._,"I might bestow on man to help his state,"
3154,_ODE._,"I saw that sorrow was his life-companion,"
3155,_ODE._,"To be embrac't bravely, not weakly shun'd:"
3156,_ODE._,"That as by toil man winneth happiness,"
3157,_ODE._,Thro' tribulation he must come to peace.
3158,_ODE._,"How to make sorrow his friend then,--this my task."
3159,_ODE._,Here was a mystery ... and how persuade
3160,_ODE._,This thorny truth?... Ye do not hearken me.                          820
3161,_ODE._,
3162,_ODE._,"CH. Yea, honour'd goddess, yea, we hearken still:"
3163,_ODE._,Stint not thy tale.
3164,_ODE._,
3165,_ODE._,DEM.                Ye might not understand.
3166,_ODE._,My tale to you must be a tale of deeds--
3167,_ODE._,How first I bade King Keleos build for me
3168,_ODE._,"A temple in Eleusis, and ordain'd"
3169,_ODE._,"My worship, and the mysteries of my thought;"
3170,_ODE._,Where in the sorrow that I underwent
3171,_ODE._,Man's state is pattern'd; and in picture shewn
3172,_ODE._,The way of his salvation.... Now with me
3173,_ODE._,--Here is a matter grateful to your ears--                           830
3174,_ODE._,"Your lov'd Persephone hath equal honour,"
3175,_ODE._,And in the spring her festival of flowers:
3176,_ODE._,And if she should return ...      [_Listening._
3177,_ODE._,Ah! hark! what hear I?
3178,_ODE._,
3179,_ODE._,CH. We hear no sound.
3180,_ODE._,
3181,_ODE._,DEM.                  Hush ye! Hermes: he comes.
3182,_ODE._,
3183,_ODE._,CH. What hearest thou?
3184,_ODE._,
3185,_ODE._,DEM.                   Hermes; and not alone.
3186,_ODE._,She is there. 'Tis she: I have won.
3187,_ODE._,
3188,_ODE._,CH.                                 Where? where?
3189,_ODE._,
3190,_ODE._,"DEM. (_aside_). Ah! can it be that out of sorrow's night,"
3191,_ODE._,"From tears, from yearning pain, from long despair,"
3192,_ODE._,Into joy's sunlight I shall come again?--
3193,_ODE._,Aside! stand ye aside!                                               840
3194,_ODE._,
3195,_ODE._,_Enter Hermes leading Persephone._
3196,_ODE._,
3197,_ODE._,"HER. Mighty Demeter, lo! I execute"

3199,_ODE._,
3200,_ODE._,DEM. I have won.
3201,_ODE._,
3202,_ODE._,"PER. Sweet Mother, thy embrace is as the welcome"
3203,_ODE._,"Of all the earth, thy kiss the breath of life."
3204,_ODE._,
3205,_ODE._,"DEM. Ah! but to me, Cora! Thy voice again..."
3206,_ODE._,My tongue is trammel'd with excess of joy.

3447,_ODE._,"And so I waited, till a forking flash"
3448,_ODE._,Of sudden lightning dazzlingly reveal'd
3449,_ODE._,All at a glance. As on a pitchy night
3450,_ODE._,The warder of some high acropolis
3451,_ODE._,"Looks down into the dark, and suddenly"

3454,_ODE._,"And ere he think of it, 'tis dark again,--                          1050"
3455,_ODE._,"So I saw all within the Cave, and held"

3467,_ODE._,And the Ã©nd evil: that what seems as good                           1060
3468,_ODE._,Is as a bloom of gold that spread thereo'er
3469,_ODE._,"May, by one stroke of the hand,"

3486,_ODE._,Will do me service: I'll not tell thee now:

3488,_ODE._,For good or ill: and we (no more than men)
3489,_ODE._,"Have power to oppose, nor any will nor choice"

3577,MARCH,
3578,MARCH,
3579,MARCH,1
3580,MARCH,
3581,MARCH,"In midmost length of hundred-citied Crete,"
3582,MARCH,"The land that cradl'd Zeus, of old renown,"
3583,MARCH,"Where grave Demeter nurseried her wheat,"
3584,MARCH,"And Minos fashion'd law, ere he went down"
3585,MARCH,"To judge the quaking hordes of Hell's domain,"
3586,MARCH,There dwelt a King on the Omphalian plain
3587,MARCH,"Eastward of Ida, in a little town."
3588,MARCH,
3589,MARCH,
3590,MARCH,2
3591,MARCH,
3592,MARCH,"Three daughters had this King, of whom my tale"
3593,MARCH,"Time hath preserved, that loveth to despise"
3594,MARCH,"The wealth which men misdeem of much avail,"
3595,MARCH,Their glories for themselves that they devise;
3596,MARCH,"For clerkly is he, old hard-featured Time,"
3597,MARCH,And poets' fabl'd song and lovers' rhyme
3598,MARCH,He storeth on his shelves to please his eyes.
3599,MARCH,
3600,MARCH,
3601,MARCH,3
3602,MARCH,
3603,MARCH,These three princesses all were fairest fair;
3604,MARCH,And of the elder twain 'tis truth to say
3605,MARCH,"That if they stood not high above compare,"
3606,MARCH,Yet in their prime they bore the palm away;
3607,MARCH,"Outwards of loveliness; but Nature's mood,"
3608,MARCH,"Gracious to make, had grudgingly endued"
3609,MARCH,And marr'd by gifting ill the beauteous clay.
3610,MARCH,
3611,MARCH,
3612,MARCH,4
3613,MARCH,
3614,MARCH,And being in honour they were well content
3615,MARCH,"To feed on lovers' looks and courtly smiles,"
3616,MARCH,"To hang their necks with jewel'd ornament,"
3617,MARCH,"And gold, that vanity in vain beguiles,"
3618,MARCH,"And live in gaze, and take their praise for due,"
3619,MARCH,To be the fairest maidens then to view
3620,MARCH,Within the shores of Greece and all her isles.
3621,MARCH,
3622,MARCH,
3623,MARCH,5
3624,MARCH,
3625,MARCH,"But of that youngest one, the third princess,"
3626,MARCH,There is no likeness; since she was as far
3627,MARCH,"From pictured beauty as is ugliness,"
3628,MARCH,"Though on the side where heavenly wonders are,"
3629,MARCH,"Ideals out of being and above,"
3630,MARCH,"Which music worshippeth, but if love love,"
3631,MARCH,"'Tis, as the poet saith, to love a star."
3632,MARCH,
3633,MARCH,
3634,MARCH,6
3635,MARCH,
3636,MARCH,Her vision rather drave from passion's heart
3637,MARCH,What earthly soil it had afore possest;
3638,MARCH,Since to man's purer unsubstantial part
3639,MARCH,The brightness of her presence was addrest:
3640,MARCH,"And such as mock'd at God, when once they saw"
3641,MARCH,"Her heavenly glance, were humbl'd, and in awe"
3642,MARCH,"Of things unseen, return'd to praise the Best."
3643,MARCH,
3644,MARCH,
3645,MARCH,7
3646,MARCH,
3647,MARCH,"And so before her, wheresoe'er she went,"
3648,MARCH,"Hushing the crowd a thrilling whisper ran,"
3649,MARCH,And silent heads were reverently bent;
3650,MARCH,Till from the people the belief began
3651,MARCH,"That Love's own mother had come down on earth,"
3652,MARCH,"Sweet Cytherea, or of mortal birth"
3653,MARCH,A greater Goddess was vouchsaf't to man.
3654,MARCH,
3655,MARCH,
3656,MARCH,8
3657,MARCH,
3658,MARCH,Then Aphrodite's statue in its place
3659,MARCH,Stood without worshippers; if Cretans pray'd
3660,MARCH,"For beauty or for children, love or grace,"
3661,MARCH,The prayer and vow were offer'd to the maid;
3662,MARCH,"Unto the maid their hymns of praise were sung,"
3663,MARCH,"Their victims bled for her, for her they hung"
3664,MARCH,"Garland and golden gift, and none forbade."
3665,MARCH,
3666,MARCH,
3667,MARCH,9
3668,MARCH,
3669,MARCH,"And thence opinion spread beyond the shores,"
3670,MARCH,"From isle to isle the wonder flew, it came"
3671,MARCH,"Across the ÃgÃ¦an on a thousand oars,"
3672,MARCH,Athens and Smyrna caught the virgin's fame;
3673,MARCH,"And East or West, where'er the tale had been,"
3674,MARCH,The adoration of the foam-born queen
3675,MARCH,"Fell to neglect, and men forgot her name."
3676,MARCH,
3677,MARCH,
3678,MARCH,10
3679,MARCH,
3680,MARCH,No longer to high Paphos now 'twas sail'd;
3681,MARCH,The fragrant altar by the Graces served
3682,MARCH,At Cnidus was forsaken; pilgrims fail'd
3683,MARCH,"The rocky island to her name reserved,"
3684,MARCH,"Proud Ephyra, and Meropis renown'd;"
3685,MARCH,"'Twas all for Crete her votaries were bound,"
3686,MARCH,And to the Cretan maid her worship swerved.
3687,MARCH,
3688,MARCH,
3689,MARCH,11
3690,MARCH,
3691,MARCH,"Which when in heaven great Aphrodite saw,"
3692,MARCH,"Who is the breather of the year's bright morn,"
3693,MARCH,"Fount of desire and beauty without flaw,"
3694,MARCH,Herself the life that doth the world adorn;
3695,MARCH,Seeing that without her generative might
3696,MARCH,"Nothing can spring upon the shores of light,"
3697,MARCH,Nor any bud of joy or love be born;
3698,MARCH,
3699,MARCH,
3700,MARCH,12
3701,MARCH,
3702,MARCH,"She, when she saw the insult, did not hide"
3703,MARCH,"Her indignation, that a mortal frail"
3704,MARCH,"With her eterne divinity had vied,"
3705,MARCH,"Her fair Hellenic empire to assail,"
3706,MARCH,"For which she had fled the doom of Ninus old,"
3707,MARCH,And left her wanton images unsoul'd
3708,MARCH,In Babylon and Zidon soon to fail.
3709,MARCH,
3710,MARCH,
3711,MARCH,13
3712,MARCH,
3713,MARCH,"'Not long,' she cried, 'shall that poor girl of Crete"
3714,MARCH,God it in my despite; for I will bring
3715,MARCH,Such mischief on the sickly counterfeit
3716,MARCH,As soon shall cure her tribe of worshipping:
3717,MARCH,"Her beauty will I mock with loathÃ¨d lust,"
3718,MARCH,"Bow down her dainty spirit to the dust,"
3719,MARCH,And leave her long alive to feel the sting.'
3720,MARCH,
3721,MARCH,
3722,MARCH,14
3723,MARCH,
3724,MARCH,"With that she calls to her her comely boy,"
3725,MARCH,"The limber scion of the God of War,"
3726,MARCH,"The fruit adulterous, which for man's annoy"
3727,MARCH,"To that fierce partner Cytherea bore,"
3728,MARCH,"Eros, the ever young, who only grew"
3729,MARCH,"In mischief, and was Cupid named anew"
3730,MARCH,In westering aftertime of latin lore.
3731,MARCH,
3732,MARCH,
3733,MARCH,15
3734,MARCH,
3735,MARCH,"What the first dawn of manhood is, the hour"
3736,MARCH,"When beauty, from its fleshy bud unpent,"
3737,MARCH,"Flaunts like the corol of a summer flower,"
3738,MARCH,"As if all life were for that ornament,"
3739,MARCH,"Such Eros seemed in years, a trifler gay,"
3740,MARCH,The prodigal of an immortal day
3741,MARCH,"For ever spending, and yet never spent."
3742,MARCH,
3743,MARCH,
3744,MARCH,16
3745,MARCH,
3746,MARCH,His skin is brilliant with the nimble flood
3747,MARCH,"Of ichor, that comes dancing from his heart,"
3748,MARCH,"Lively as fire, and redder than the blood,"
3749,MARCH,"And maketh in his eyes small flashes dart,"
3750,MARCH,"And curleth his hair golden, and distilleth"
3751,MARCH,"Honey on his tongue, and all his body filleth"
3752,MARCH,With wanton lightsomeness in every part.
3753,MARCH,
3754,MARCH,
3755,MARCH,17
3756,MARCH,
3757,MARCH,"Naked he goeth, but with sprightly wings"
3758,MARCH,"Red, iridescent, are his shoulders fledged."
3759,MARCH,"A bow his weapon, which he deftly strings,"
3760,MARCH,And little arrows barb'd and keenly edged;
3761,MARCH,And these he shooteth true; but else the youth
3762,MARCH,"For all his seeming recketh naught of truth,"
3763,MARCH,But most deceiveth where he most is pledged.
3764,MARCH,
3765,MARCH,
3766,MARCH,18
3767,MARCH,
3768,MARCH,'Tis he that maketh in men's heart a strife
3769,MARCH,"Between remorseful reason and desire,"
3770,MARCH,"Till with life lost they lose the love of life,"
3771,MARCH,And by their own hands wretchedly expire;
3772,MARCH,Or slain in bloody rivalries they miss
3773,MARCH,"Even the short embracement of their bliss,"
3774,MARCH,His smile of fury and his kiss of fire.
3775,MARCH,
3776,MARCH,
3777,MARCH,19
3778,MARCH,
3779,MARCH,"He makes the strong man weak, the weak man wild;"
3780,MARCH,Ruins great business and purpose high;
3781,MARCH,"Brings down the wise to folly reconciled,"
3782,MARCH,And martial captains on their knees to sigh:
3783,MARCH,"He changeth dynasties, and on the head"
3784,MARCH,"Of duteous heroes, who for honour bled,"
3785,MARCH,Smircheth the laurel that can never die.
3786,MARCH,
3787,MARCH,
3788,MARCH,20
3789,MARCH,
3790,MARCH,"Him then she call'd, and gravely kissing told"
3791,MARCH,The great dishonour to her godhead done;
3792,MARCH,"And how, if he from that in heaven would hold,"
3793,MARCH,On earth he must maintain it as her son;
3794,MARCH,"The rather that his weapons were most fit,"
3795,MARCH,As was his skill ordain'd to champion it;
3796,MARCH,And flattering thus his ready zeal she won.
3797,MARCH,
3798,MARCH,
3799,MARCH,21
3800,MARCH,
3801,MARCH,"Whereon she quickly led him down on earth,"
3802,MARCH,"And show'd him PSYCHE, thus the maid was named;"
3803,MARCH,"Whom when she show'd, but coud not hide her worth,"
3804,MARCH,She grew with envy tenfold more enflamed.
3805,MARCH,"'But if,' she cried, 'thou smite her as I bid,"
3806,MARCH,"Soon shall our glory of this affront be rid,"
3807,MARCH,And she and all her likes for ever shamed.
3808,MARCH,
3809,MARCH,
3810,MARCH,22
3811,MARCH,
3812,MARCH,"'Make her to love the loathliest, basest wretch,"
3813,MARCH,"Deform'd in body, and of moonstruck mind,"
3814,MARCH,"A hideous brute and vicious, born to fetch"
3815,MARCH,Anger from dogs and cursing from the blind.
3816,MARCH,And let her passion for the monster be
3817,MARCH,As shameless and detestable as he
3818,MARCH,Is most extreme and vile of humankind.'
3819,MARCH,
3820,MARCH,
3821,MARCH,23
3822,MARCH,
3823,MARCH,"Which said, when he agreed, she spake no more,"
3824,MARCH,"But left him to his task, and took her way"
3825,MARCH,"Beside the ripples of the shell-strewn shore,"
3826,MARCH,"The southward stretching margin of a bay,"
3827,MARCH,"Whose sandy curves she pass'd, and taking stand"
3828,MARCH,"Upon its taper horn of furthest land,"
3829,MARCH,Lookt left and right to rise and set of day.
3830,MARCH,
3831,MARCH,
3832,MARCH,24
3833,MARCH,
3834,MARCH,"Fair was the sight; for now, though full an hour"
3835,MARCH,"The sun had sunk, she saw the evening light"
3836,MARCH,"In shifting colour to the zenith tower,"
3837,MARCH,And grow more gorgeous ever and more bright.
3838,MARCH,"Bathed in the warm and comfortable glow,"
3839,MARCH,"The fair delighted queen forgot her woe,"
3840,MARCH,And watch'd the unwonted pageant of the night.
3841,MARCH,
3842,MARCH,
3843,MARCH,25
3844,MARCH,
3845,MARCH,"Broad and low down, where late the sun had been"
3846,MARCH,"A wealth of orange-gold was thickly shed,"
3847,MARCH,"Fading above into a field of green,"
3848,MARCH,Like apples ere they ripen into red;
3849,MARCH,Then to the height a variable hue
3850,MARCH,"Of rose and pink and crimson freak'd with blue,"
3851,MARCH,And olive-border'd clouds o'er lilac led.
3852,MARCH,
3853,MARCH,
3854,MARCH,26
3855,MARCH,
3856,MARCH,High in the opposÃ¨d west the wondering moon
3857,MARCH,All silvery green in flying green was fleec't;
3858,MARCH,And round the blazing South the splendour soon
3859,MARCH,"Caught all the heaven, and ran to North and East;"
3860,MARCH,And Aphrodite knew the thing was wrought
3861,MARCH,"By cunning of Poseidon, and she thought"
3862,MARCH,She would go see with whom he kept his feast.
3863,MARCH,
3864,MARCH,
3865,MARCH,27
3866,MARCH,
3867,MARCH,Swift to her wish came swimming on the waves
3868,MARCH,"His lovely ocean nymphs, her guides to be,"
3869,MARCH,"The Nereids all, who live among the caves"
3870,MARCH,"And valleys of the deep, CymodocÃ¨,"
3871,MARCH,"AgavÃ¨, blue-eyed Hallia and NesÃ¦a,"
3872,MARCH,"Speio, and ThoÃ«, GlaucÃ¨ and ActÃ¦a,"
3873,MARCH,"Iaira, MelitÃ¨ and AmphinomÃ¨,"
3874,MARCH,
3875,MARCH,
3876,MARCH,28
3877,MARCH,
3878,MARCH,"ApseudÃ¨s and NemertÃ¨s, Callianassa,"
3879,MARCH,"CymothoÃ«, Thaleia, Limnorrhea,"
3880,MARCH,"ClymenÃ¨, Ianeira and Ianassa,"
3881,MARCH,"Doris and PanopÃ¨ and Galatea,"
3882,MARCH,"DynamenÃ¨, DexamenÃ¨ and Maira,"
3883,MARCH,"Ferusa, Doto, Proto, Callianeira,"
3884,MARCH,"AmphithoÃ«, Oreithuia and Amathea."
3885,MARCH,
3886,MARCH,
3887,MARCH,29
3888,MARCH,
3889,MARCH,And after them sad Melicertes drave
3890,MARCH,"His chariot, that with swift unfellied wheel,"
3891,MARCH,"By his two dolphins drawn along the wave,"
3892,MARCH,"Flew as they plunged, yet did not dip nor reel,"
3893,MARCH,But like a plough that shears the heavy land
3894,MARCH,"Stood on the flood, and back on either hand"
3895,MARCH,O'erturn'd the briny furrow with its keel.
3896,MARCH,
3897,MARCH,
3898,MARCH,30
3899,MARCH,
3900,MARCH,"Behind came Tritons, that their conches blew,"
3901,MARCH,"Greenbearded, tail'd like fish, all sleek and stark;"
3902,MARCH,"And hippocampi tamed, a bristly crew,"
3903,MARCH,"The browzers of old Proteus' weedy park,"
3904,MARCH,"Whose chiefer Mermen brought a shell for boat,"
3905,MARCH,"And balancing its hollow fan afloat,"
3906,MARCH,Push'd it to shore and bade the queen embark:
3907,MARCH,
3908,MARCH,
3909,MARCH,31
3910,MARCH,
3911,MARCH,And then the goddess stept upon the shell
3912,MARCH,Which took her weight; and others threw a train
3913,MARCH,"Of soft silk o'er her, that unfurl'd to swell"
3914,MARCH,"In sails, at breath of flying Zephyrs twain;"
3915,MARCH,"And all her way with foam in laughter strewn,"
3916,MARCH,"With stir of music and of conches blown,"
3917,MARCH,Was Aphrodite launch'd upon the main.
3918,MARCH,
3919,MARCH,

3922,APRIL,APRIL
3923,APRIL,
3924,APRIL,
3925,APRIL,1
3926,APRIL,
3927,APRIL,"But fairest Psyche still in favour rose,"
3928,APRIL,Nor knew the jealous power against her sworn;
3929,APRIL,"And more her beauty now surpass't her foe's,"
3930,APRIL,"Since 'twas transfigured by the spirit forlorn,"
3931,APRIL,"That writeth, to the perfecting of grace,"
3932,APRIL,"Immortal question in a mortal face,"
3933,APRIL,The vague desire whereunto man is born.
3934,APRIL,
3935,APRIL,
3936,APRIL,2
3937,APRIL,
3938,APRIL,"Already in good time her sisters both,"
3939,APRIL,"Whose honest charms were never famed as hers,"
3940,APRIL,"With princes of the isle had plighted troth,"
3941,APRIL,And gone to rule their foreign courtiers;
3942,APRIL,"But she, exalted evermore beyond"
3943,APRIL,"Their loveliness, made yet no lover fond,"
3944,APRIL,And gain'd but number to her worshippers.
3945,APRIL,
3946,APRIL,
3947,APRIL,3
3948,APRIL,
3949,APRIL,"To joy in others' joy had been her lot,"
3950,APRIL,And now that that was gone she wept to see
3951,APRIL,How her transcendent beauty overshot
3952,APRIL,The common aim of all felicity.
3953,APRIL,For love she sigh'd; and had some peasant rude
3954,APRIL,"For true love's sake in simple passion woo'd,"
3955,APRIL,Then Psyche had not scorn'd his wife to be.
3956,APRIL,
3957,APRIL,
3958,APRIL,4
3959,APRIL,
3960,APRIL,"For what is Beauty, if it doth not fire"
3961,APRIL,The loving answer of an eager soul?
3962,APRIL,"Since 'tis the native food of man's desire,"
3963,APRIL,And doth to good our varying world control;
3964,APRIL,"Which, when it was not, was for Beauty's sake"
3965,APRIL,"Desired and made by Love, who still doth make"
3966,APRIL,A beauteous path thereon to Beauty's goal.
3967,APRIL,
3968,APRIL,
3969,APRIL,5
3970,APRIL,
3971,APRIL,"Should all men by some hateful venom die,"
3972,APRIL,The pity were that o'er the unpeopl'd sphere
3973,APRIL,The sun would still bedeck the evening sky
3974,APRIL,"And the unimaginable hues appear,"
3975,APRIL,With none to mark the rose and gold and green;
3976,APRIL,"That Spring should walk the earth, and nothing seen"
3977,APRIL,Of her fresh delicacy year by year.
3978,APRIL,
3979,APRIL,
3980,APRIL,6
3981,APRIL,
3982,APRIL,"And if some beauteous things,--whose heavenly worth"
3983,APRIL,"And function overpass our mortal sense,--"
3984,APRIL,Lie waste and unregarded on the earth
3985,APRIL,"By reason of our gross intelligence,"
3986,APRIL,"These are not vain, because in nature's scheme"
3987,APRIL,It lives that we shall grow from dream to dream
3988,APRIL,In time to gather an enchantment thence.
3989,APRIL,
3990,APRIL,
3991,APRIL,7
3992,APRIL,
3993,APRIL,Even as we see the fairest works of men
3994,APRIL,"Awhile neglected, and the makers die;"
3995,APRIL,"But Truth comes weeping to their graves, and then"
3996,APRIL,Their fames victoriously mounting high
3997,APRIL,"Do battle with the regnant names of eld,"
3998,APRIL,To win their seats; as when the Gods rebel'd
3999,APRIL,Against their sires and drave them from the sky.
4000,APRIL,
4001,APRIL,
4002,APRIL,8
4003,APRIL,
4004,APRIL,But to be praised for beauty and denied
4005,APRIL,"The meed of beauty, this was yet unknown:"
4006,APRIL,The best and bravest men have ever vied
4007,APRIL,To win the fairest women for their own.
4008,APRIL,"Thus Psyche spake, or reason'd in her mind,"
4009,APRIL,"Disconsolate; and with self-pity pined,"
4010,APRIL,In the deserted halls wandering alone.
4011,APRIL,
4012,APRIL,
4013,APRIL,9
4014,APRIL,
4015,APRIL,And grievÃ¨d grew the King to see her woe:
4016,APRIL,"And blaming first the gods for her disease,"
4017,APRIL,He purposed to their oracle to go
4018,APRIL,"To question how he might their wrath appease,"
4019,APRIL,"Or, if that might not be, the worst to hear,--"
4020,APRIL,Which is the last poor hope of them that fear.--
4021,APRIL,"So he took his ship upon the northern seas,"
4022,APRIL,
4023,APRIL,
4024,APRIL,10
4025,APRIL,
4026,APRIL,"And journeying to the shrine of Delphi went,"
4027,APRIL,"The temple of Apollo Pythian,"
4028,APRIL,Where when the god he question'd if 'twas meant
4029,APRIL,"That Psyche should be wed, and to what man,"
4030,APRIL,"The tripod shook, and o'er the vaporous well"
4031,APRIL,"The chanting Pythoness gave oracle,"
4032,APRIL,And thus in priestly verse the sentence ran:
4033,APRIL,
4034,APRIL,
4035,APRIL,11
4036,APRIL,
4037,APRIL,_High on the topmost rock with funeral feast
4038,APRIL,"Convey and leave the maid, nor look to find"
4039,APRIL,"A mortal husband, but a savage beast,"
4040,APRIL,The viperous scourge of gods and humankind;
4041,APRIL,"Who shames and vexes all, and as he flies"
4042,APRIL,"With sword and fire, Zeus trembles in the skies,"
4043,APRIL,And groans arise from souls to hell consigned._
4044,APRIL,
4045,APRIL,
4046,APRIL,12
4047,APRIL,
4048,APRIL,With which reply the King return'd full sad:
4049,APRIL,"For though he nothing more might understand,"
4050,APRIL,Yet in the bitter bidding that he had
4051,APRIL,"No man made question of the plain command,"
4052,APRIL,That he must sacrifice the tender flower
4053,APRIL,"Of his own blood to a demonian power,"
4054,APRIL,Upon the rocky mount with his own hand.
4055,APRIL,
4056,APRIL,
4057,APRIL,13
4058,APRIL,
4059,APRIL,"Some said that she to Talos was devote,"
4060,APRIL,"The metal giant, who with mile-long stride"
4061,APRIL,"Cover'd the isle, walking around by rote"
4062,APRIL,Thrice every day at his appointed tide;
4063,APRIL,"Who shepherded the sea-goats on the coast,"
4064,APRIL,"And, as he past, caught up and live would roast,"
4065,APRIL,Pressing them to his burning ribs and side:
4066,APRIL,
4067,APRIL,
4068,APRIL,14
4069,APRIL,
4070,APRIL,Whose head was made of fine gold-beaten work
4071,APRIL,"Of silver pure his arms and gleaming chest,"
4072,APRIL,"Thence of green-bloomÃ¨d bronze far as the fork,"
4073,APRIL,Of iron weather-rusted all the rest.
4074,APRIL,"One single vein he had, which running down"
4075,APRIL,"From head to foot was open in his crown,"
4076,APRIL,And closÃ¨d by a nail; such was this pest.
4077,APRIL,
4078,APRIL,
4079,APRIL,15
4080,APRIL,
4081,APRIL,"A little while they spent in sad delay,"
4082,APRIL,"Then order'd, as the oracle had said,"
4083,APRIL,The cold feast and funereal display
4084,APRIL,Wherewith the fated bridal should be sped:
4085,APRIL,And their black pageantry and vain despairing
4086,APRIL,"When Psyche saw, and for herself preparing"
4087,APRIL,"The hopeless ceremonial of the dead,"
4088,APRIL,
4089,APRIL,
4090,APRIL,16
4091,APRIL,
4092,APRIL,"Then spake she to the King and said 'O Sire,"
4093,APRIL,Why wilt thou veil those venerable eyes
4094,APRIL,"With piteous tears, which must of me require"
4095,APRIL,More tears again than for myself arise?
4096,APRIL,"Then, on the day my beauty first o'erstept"
4097,APRIL,Its mortal place it had been well to have wept;
4098,APRIL,But now the fault beyond our ruing lies.
4099,APRIL,
4100,APRIL,
4101,APRIL,17
4102,APRIL,
4103,APRIL,"'As to be worship'd was my whole undoing,"
4104,APRIL,So my submission must the forfeit pay:
4105,APRIL,"And welcome were the morning of my wooing,"
4106,APRIL,Tho' after it should dawn no other day.
4107,APRIL,Up to the mountain! for I hear the voice
4108,APRIL,"Of my belovÃ¨d on the winds, _Rejoice,"
4109,APRIL,"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away_!'"
4110,APRIL,
4111,APRIL,
4112,APRIL,18
4113,APRIL,
4114,APRIL,"With such distemper'd speech, that little cheer'd"
4115,APRIL,"Her mourning house, she went to choose with care"
4116,APRIL,"The raiment for her day of wedlock weird,"
4117,APRIL,Her body as for burial to prepare;
4118,APRIL,"But laved with bridal water, from the stream"
4119,APRIL,Where Hera bathed; for still her fate supreme
4120,APRIL,"Was doubtful, whether Love or Death it were:"
4121,APRIL,
4122,APRIL,
4123,APRIL,19
4124,APRIL,
4125,APRIL,"Love that is made of joy, and Death of fear:"
4126,APRIL,"Nay, but not these held Psyche in suspense;"
4127,APRIL,Hers was the hope that following by the bier
4128,APRIL,Boweth its head beneath the dark immense:
4129,APRIL,Her fear the dread of life that turns to hide
4130,APRIL,"Its tragic tears, what hour the happy bride"
4131,APRIL,Ventures for love her maiden innocence.
4132,APRIL,
4133,APRIL,
4134,APRIL,20
4135,APRIL,
4136,APRIL,They set on high upon the bridal wain
4137,APRIL,"Her bed for bier, and yet no corpse thereon;"
4138,APRIL,But like as when unto a warrior slain
4139,APRIL,And not brought home the ceremonies done
4140,APRIL,"Are empty, for afar his body brave"
4141,APRIL,"Lies lost, deep buried by the wandering wave"
4142,APRIL,"Or 'neath the foes his fury fell upon,--"
4143,APRIL,
4144,APRIL,
4145,APRIL,21
4146,APRIL,
4147,APRIL,"So was her hearse: and with it went afore,"
4148,APRIL,"Singing the solemn dirge that moves to tears,"
4149,APRIL,"The singers; and behind, clad as for war,"
4150,APRIL,"The King uncrown'd among his mournful peers,"
4151,APRIL,All 'neath their armour robed in linen white;
4152,APRIL,"And in their left were shields, and in their right"
4153,APRIL,Torches they bore aloft instead of spears.
4154,APRIL,
4155,APRIL,
4156,APRIL,22
4157,APRIL,
4158,APRIL,"And next the virgin tribe in white forth sail'd,"
4159,APRIL,With wreaths of dittany; and 'midst them there
4160,APRIL,"Went Psyche, all in lily-whiteness veil'd,"
4161,APRIL,The white Quince-blossom chapleting her hair:
4162,APRIL,"And last the common folk, a weeping crowd,"
4163,APRIL,Far as the city-gates with wailings loud
4164,APRIL,Follow'd the sad procession in despair.
4165,APRIL,
4166,APRIL,
4167,APRIL,23
4168,APRIL,
4169,APRIL,"Thus forth and up the mount they went, until"
4170,APRIL,"The funeral chariot must be left behind,"
4171,APRIL,Since road was none for steepness of the hill;
4172,APRIL,And slowly by the narrow path they wind:
4173,APRIL,All afternoon their white and scatter'd file
4174,APRIL,"Toil'd on distinct, ascending many a mile"
4175,APRIL,Over the long brown slopes and crags unkind.
4176,APRIL,
4177,APRIL,
4178,APRIL,24
4179,APRIL,
4180,APRIL,But ere unto the snowy peak they came
4181,APRIL,"Of that stormshapen pyramid so high,"
4182,APRIL,"'Twas evening, and with footsteps slow and lame"
4183,APRIL,They gather'd up their lagging company:
4184,APRIL,"And then her sire, even as Apollo bade,"
4185,APRIL,"Set on the topmost rock the hapless maid,"
4186,APRIL,With trembling hands and melancholy cry.
4187,APRIL,
4188,APRIL,
4189,APRIL,25
4190,APRIL,
4191,APRIL,And now the sun was sunk; only the peak
4192,APRIL,Flash'd like a jewel in the deepening blue:
4193,APRIL,"And from the shade beneath none dared to speak,"
4194,APRIL,"But all look'd up, where glorified anew"
4195,APRIL,Psyche sat islanded in living day.
4196,APRIL,"Breathless they watcht her, till the last red ray"
4197,APRIL,Fled from her lifted arm that waved adieu.
4198,APRIL,
4199,APRIL,
4200,APRIL,26
4201,APRIL,
4202,APRIL,"There left they her, turning with sad farewells"
4203,APRIL,"To haste their homeward course, as best they might:"
4204,APRIL,"But night was crowding up the barren fells,"
4205,APRIL,And hid full soon their rocky path from sight;
4206,APRIL,And each unto his stumbling foot to hold
4207,APRIL,"His torch was fain, for o'er the moon was roll'd"
4208,APRIL,"A mighty cloud from heaven, to blot her light."
4209,APRIL,
4210,APRIL,
4211,APRIL,27
4212,APRIL,
4213,APRIL,And thro' the darkness for long while was seen
4214,APRIL,That armour'd train with waving fires to thread
4215,APRIL,"Downwards, by pass, defile, and black ravine,"
4216,APRIL,Each leading on the way that he was led.
4217,APRIL,"Slowly they gain'd the plain, and one by one"
4218,APRIL,"Into the shadows of the woods were gone,"
4219,APRIL,Or in the clinging mists were quench'd and fled.
4220,APRIL,
4221,APRIL,
4222,APRIL,28
4223,APRIL,
4224,APRIL,"But unto Psyche, pondering o'er her doom"
4225,APRIL,"In tearful silence on her stony chair,"
4226,APRIL,A Zephyr straying out of heaven's wide room
4227,APRIL,"Rush'd down, and gathering round her unaware"
4228,APRIL,Fill'd with his breath her vesture and her veil;
4229,APRIL,"And like a ship, that crowding all her sail"
4230,APRIL,"Leans to accompany the tranquil air,"
4231,APRIL,
4232,APRIL,
4233,APRIL,29
4234,APRIL,
4235,APRIL,"She yielded, and was borne with swimming brain"
4236,APRIL,"And airy joy, along the mountain side,"
4237,APRIL,"Till, hid from earth by ridging summits twain,"
4238,APRIL,They came upon a valley deep and wide;
4239,APRIL,"Where the strong Zephyr with his burden sank,"
4240,APRIL,"And laid her down upon a grassy bank,"
4241,APRIL,'Mong thyme and violets and daisies pied.
4242,APRIL,
4243,APRIL,
4244,APRIL,30
4245,APRIL,
4246,APRIL,And straight upon the touch of that sweet bed
4247,APRIL,Both woe and wonder melted fast away:
4248,APRIL,"And sleep with gentle stress her sense o'erspread,"
4249,APRIL,Gathering as darkness doth on drooping day:
4250,APRIL,"And nestling to the ground, she slowly drew"
4251,APRIL,"Her wearied limbs together, and, ere she knew,"
4252,APRIL,Wrapt in forgetfulness and slumber lay.
4253,APRIL,
4254,APRIL,
4255,MAY,MAY
4256,MAY,
4257,MAY,
4258,MAY,1
4259,MAY,
4260,MAY,After long sleep when Psyche first awoke
4261,MAY,"Among the grasses 'neath the open skies,"
4262,MAY,"And heard the mounting larks, whose carol spoke"
4263,MAY,"Delighted invitation to arise,"
4264,MAY,She lay as one who after many a league
4265,MAY,"Hath slept off memory with his long fatigue,"
4266,MAY,And waking knows not in what place he lies:
4267,MAY,
4268,MAY,
4269,MAY,2
4270,MAY,
4271,MAY,"Anon her quickening thought took up its task,"
4272,MAY,And all came back as it had happ'd o'ernight;
4273,MAY,"The sad procession of the wedding mask,"
4274,MAY,"The melancholy toiling up the height,"
4275,MAY,The solitary rock where she was left;
4276,MAY,"And thence in dark and airy waftage reft,"
4277,MAY,How on the flowers she had been disburden'd light.
4278,MAY,
4279,MAY,
4280,MAY,3
4281,MAY,
4282,MAY,Thereafter she would rise and see what place
4283,MAY,"That voyage had its haven in, and found"
4284,MAY,"She stood upon a little hill, whose base"
4285,MAY,Shelved off into the valley all around;
4286,MAY,"And all round that the steep cliffs rose away,"
4287,MAY,Save on one side where to the break of day
4288,MAY,The widening dale withdrew in falling ground.
4289,MAY,
4290,MAY,
4291,MAY,4
4292,MAY,
4293,MAY,"There, out from over sea, and scarce so high"
4294,MAY,"As she, the sun above his watery blaze"
4295,MAY,"Upbroke the grey dome of the morning sky,"
4296,MAY,And struck the island with his level rays;
4297,MAY,"Sifting his gold thro' lazy mists, that still"
4298,MAY,"Climb'd on the shadowy roots of every hill,"
4299,MAY,And in the tree-tops breathed their silvery haze.
4300,MAY,
4301,MAY,
4302,MAY,5
4303,MAY,
4304,MAY,At hand on either side there was a wood;
4305,MAY,"And on the upward lawn, that sloped between,"
4306,MAY,"Not many paces back a temple stood,"
4307,MAY,By even steps ascending from the green;
4308,MAY,"With shaft and pediment of marble made,"
4309,MAY,"It fill'd the passage of the rising glade,"
4310,MAY,And there withstay'd the sun in dazzling sheen.
4311,MAY,
4312,MAY,
4313,MAY,6
4314,MAY,
4315,MAY,"Too fair for human art, so Psyche thought,"
4316,MAY,It might the fancy of some god rejoice;
4317,MAY,"Like to those halls which lame HephÃ¦stos wrought,"
4318,MAY,"Original, for each god to his choice,"
4319,MAY,In high Olympus; where his matchless lyre
4320,MAY,"Apollo wakes, and the responsive choir"
4321,MAY,Of Muses sing alternate with sweet voice.
4322,MAY,
4323,MAY,
4324,MAY,7
4325,MAY,
4326,MAY,"Wondering she drew anigh, and in a while"
4327,MAY,"Went up the steps as she would entrance win,"
4328,MAY,And faced her shadow 'neath the peristyle
4329,MAY,"Upon the golden gate, whose flanges twin--"
4330,MAY,"As there she stood, irresolute at heart"
4331,MAY,To try--swung to her of themselves apart;
4332,MAY,Whereat she past between and stood within.
4333,MAY,
4334,MAY,
4335,MAY,8
4336,MAY,
4337,MAY,"A foursquare court it was with marble floor'd,"
4338,MAY,"Embay'd about with pillar'd porticoes,"
4339,MAY,That echo'd in a somnolent accord
4340,MAY,"The music of a fountain, which arose"
4341,MAY,"Sparkling in air, and splashing in its tank;"
4342,MAY,"Whose wanton babble, as it swell'd or sank,"
4343,MAY,Gave idle voice to silence and repose.
4344,MAY,
4345,MAY,
4346,MAY,9
4347,MAY,
4348,MAY,"Thro' doors beneath the further colonnade,"
4349,MAY,"Like a deep cup's reflected glooms of gold,"
4350,MAY,The inner rooms glow'd with inviting shade:
4351,MAY,"And, standing in the court, she might behold"
4352,MAY,"Cedar, and silk, and silver; and that all"
4353,MAY,The pargeting of ceiling and of wall
4354,MAY,Was fresco'd o'er with figures manifold.
4355,MAY,
4356,MAY,
4357,MAY,10
4358,MAY,
4359,MAY,"Then making bold to go within, she heard"
4360,MAY,Murmur of gentle welcome in her ear;
4361,MAY,"And seeing none that coud have spoken word,"
4362,MAY,"She waited: when again Lady, draw near;"
4363,MAY,Enter! was cried; and now more voices came
4364,MAY,"From all the air around calling her name,"
4365,MAY,And bidding her rejoice and have no fear.
4366,MAY,
4367,MAY,
4368,MAY,11
4369,MAY,
4370,MAY,"And one, if she would rest, would show her bed,"
4371,MAY,"Pillow'd for sleep, with fragrant linen fine;"
4372,MAY,"One, were she hungry, had a table spread"
4373,MAY,Like as the high gods have it when they dine:
4374,MAY,"Or, would she bathe, were those would heat the bath;"
4375,MAY,"The joyous cries contending in her path,"
4376,MAY,"Psyche, they said, What wilt thou? all is thine."
4377,MAY,
4378,MAY,
4379,MAY,12
4380,MAY,
4381,MAY,"Then Psyche would have thank'd their service true,"
4382,MAY,But that she fear'd her echoing words might scare
4383,MAY,Those sightless tongues; and well by dream she knew
4384,MAY,"The voices of the messengers of prayer,"
4385,MAY,"Which fly upon the gods' commandment, when"
4386,MAY,"They answer the supreme desires of men,"
4387,MAY,Or for a while in pity hush their care.
4388,MAY,
4389,MAY,
4390,MAY,13
4391,MAY,
4392,MAY,"'Twas fancy's consummation, and because"
4393,MAY,"She would do joy no curious despite,"
4394,MAY,She made no wonder how the wonder was;
4395,MAY,Only concern'd to take her full delight.
4396,MAY,"So to the bath,--what luxury could be"
4397,MAY,Better enhanced by eyeless ministry?--
4398,MAY,She follows with the voices that invite.
4399,MAY,
4400,MAY,
4401,MAY,14
4402,MAY,
4403,MAY,"There being deliciously refresht, from soil"
4404,MAY,"Of earth made pure by water, fire, and air,"
4405,MAY,"They clad her in soft robes of Asian toil,"
4406,MAY,"Scented, that in her queenly wardrobe were;"
4407,MAY,"And led her forth to dine, and all around"
4408,MAY,"Sang as they served, the while a choral sound"
4409,MAY,Of strings unseen and reeds the burden bare.
4410,MAY,
4411,MAY,
4412,MAY,15
4413,MAY,
4414,MAY,"P athetic strains and passionate they wove,"
4415,MAY,U rgent in ecstasies of heavenly sense;
4416,MAY,"R esponsive rivalries, that, while they strove"
4417,MAY,"C ombined in full harmonious suspense,"
4418,MAY,"E ntrancing wild desire, then fell at last"
4419,MAY,"L ull'd in soft closes, and with gay contrast"
4420,MAY,L aunch'd forth their fresh unwearied excellence.
4421,MAY,
4422,MAY,
4423,MAY,16
4424,MAY,
4425,MAY,"Now Psyche, when her twofold feast was o'er,"
4426,MAY,Would feed her eye; and choosing for her guide
4427,MAY,"A low-voiced singer, bade her come explore"
4428,MAY,The wondrous house; until on every side
4429,MAY,"As surfeited with beauty, and seeing nought"
4430,MAY,"But what was rich and fair beyond her thought,"
4431,MAY,"And all her own, thus to the voice she cried:"
4432,MAY,
4433,MAY,
4434,MAY,17
4435,MAY,
4436,MAY,"'Am I indeed a goddess, or is this"
4437,MAY,But to be dead: and through the gates of death
4438,MAY,Passing unwittingly doth man not miss
4439,MAY,Body nor memory nor living breath;
4440,MAY,"Nor by demerits of his deeds is cast,"
4441,MAY,"But, paid with the desire he holdeth fast,"
4442,MAY,Is holp with all his heart imagineth?'
4443,MAY,
4444,MAY,
4445,MAY,18
4446,MAY,
4447,MAY,But her for all reply the wandering tongue
4448,MAY,Call'd to the chamber where her bed was laid
4449,MAY,With flower'd broideries of linen hung:
4450,MAY,And round the walls in painting were portray'd
4451,MAY,Love's victories over the gods renown'd.
4452,MAY,Ares and Aphrodite here lay bound
4453,MAY,In the fine net that dark HephÃ¦stus made:
4454,MAY,
4455,MAY,
4456,MAY,19
4457,MAY,
4458,MAY,"Here Zeus, in likeness of a tawny bull,"
4459,MAY,"Stoop'd on the Cretan shore his mighty knee,"
4460,MAY,While off his back Europa beautiful
4461,MAY,Stept pale against the blue Carpathian sea;
4462,MAY,"And here Apollo, as he caught amazed"
4463,MAY,"Daphne, for lo! her hands shot forth upraised"
4464,MAY,"In leaves, her feet were rooted like a tree:"
4465,MAY,
4466,MAY,
4467,MAY,20
4468,MAY,
4469,MAY,"Here Dionysos, springing from his car"
4470,MAY,At sight of Ariadne; here uplept
4471,MAY,"Adonis to the chase, breaking the bar"
4472,MAY,Of Aphrodite's arm for love who wept:
4473,MAY,"He spear in hand, with leashÃ¨d dogs at strain;"
4474,MAY,A marvellous work. But Psyche soon grown fain
4475,MAY,"Of rest, betook her to her bed and slept."
4476,MAY,
4477,MAY,
4478,MAY,21
4479,MAY,
4480,MAY,"Nor long had slept, when at a sudden stir"
4481,MAY,"She woke; and one, that thro' the dark made way,"
4482,MAY,"Drew near, and stood beside; and over her"
4483,MAY,"The curtain rustl'd. Trembling now she lay,"
4484,MAY,Fainting with terror: till upon her face
4485,MAY,"A kiss, and with two gentle arms' embrace,"
4486,MAY,A voice that call'd her name in loving play.
4487,MAY,
4488,MAY,
4489,MAY,22
4490,MAY,
4491,MAY,
4492,MAY,"Though for the darkness she coud nothing see,"
4493,MAY,She wish'd not then for what the night denied:
4494,MAY,"This was the lover she had lack'd, and she,"
4495,MAY,"Loving his loving, was his willing bride."
4496,MAY,"O'erjoy'd she slept again, o'erjoy'd awoke"
4497,MAY,At break of morn upon her love to look;
4498,MAY,When lo! his empty place lay by her side.
4499,MAY,
4500,MAY,
4501,MAY,23
4502,MAY,
4503,MAY,So all that day she spent in company
4504,MAY,"Of the soft voices; and Of right, they said,"
4505,MAY,Art thou our Lady now. Be happily
4506,MAY,Thy bridal morrow by thy servants sped.
4507,MAY,"But she but long'd for night, if that might bring"
4508,MAY,Her lover back; and he on secret wing
4509,MAY,"Came with the dark, and in the darkness fled."
4510,MAY,
4511,MAY,
4512,MAY,24
4513,MAY,
4514,MAY,And this was all her life; for every night
4515,MAY,"He came, and though his name she never learn'd,"
4516,MAY,Nor was his image yielded to her sight
4517,MAY,"At morn or eve, she neither look'd nor yearn'd"
4518,MAY,Beyond her happiness: and custom brought
4519,MAY,An ease to pleasure; nor would Psyche's thought
4520,MAY,"Have ever to her earthly home return'd,"
4521,MAY,
4522,MAY,
4523,MAY,25
4524,MAY,
4525,MAY,"But that one night he said 'Psyche, my soul,"
4526,MAY,Sad danger threatens us: thy sisters twain
4527,MAY,"Come to the mountain top, whence I thee stole,"
4528,MAY,And thou wilt hear their voices thence complain.
4529,MAY,Answer them not: for it must end our love
4530,MAY,If they should hear or spy thee from above.'
4531,MAY,And Psyche said 'Their cry shall be in vain.'
4532,MAY,
4533,MAY,
4534,MAY,26
4535,MAY,
4536,MAY,"But being again alone, she thought 'twas hard"
4537,MAY,On her own blood; and blamed her joy as thief
4538,MAY,"Of theirs, her comfort which their comfort barr'd;"
4539,MAY,When she their care might be their care's relief.
4540,MAY,"All day she brooded on her father's woe,"
4541,MAY,"And when at night her lover kisst her, lo!"
4542,MAY,Her tender face was wet with tears of grief.
4543,MAY,
4544,MAY,
4545,MAY,27
4546,MAY,
4547,MAY,"Then question'd why she wept, she all confest;"
4548,MAY,And begg'd of him she might but once go nigh
4549,MAY,To set her sire's and sisters' fears at rest;
4550,MAY,Till he for pity coud not but comply:
4551,MAY,'Only if they should ask thee of thy love
4552,MAY,Discover nothing to their ears above.'
4553,MAY,And Psyche said 'In vain shall be their cry.'
4554,MAY,

4557,MAY,
4558,MAY,"And yet with day no sooner was alone,"
4559,MAY,Than she for loneliness her promise rued:
4560,MAY,"That having so much pleasure for her own,"
4561,MAY,'Twas all unshared and spent in solitude.
4562,MAY,"And when at night her love flew to his place,"
4563,MAY,"More than afore she shamed his fond embrace,"
4564,MAY,And piteously with tears her plaint renew'd.
4565,MAY,
4566,MAY,
4567,MAY,29
4568,MAY,
4569,MAY,"The more he now denied, the more she wept;"
4570,MAY,"Nor would in anywise be comforted,"
4571,MAY,"Unless her sisters, on the Zephyr swept,"
4572,MAY,"Should in those halls be one day bathed and fed,"
4573,MAY,And see themselves the palace where she reign'd.
4574,MAY,"And he, by force of tears at last constrain'd,"
4575,MAY,"Granted her wish unwillingly, and said:"
4576,MAY,
4577,MAY,
4578,MAY,30
4579,MAY,
4580,MAY,'Much to our peril hast thou won thy will;
4581,MAY,"Thy sisters' love, seeing thee honour'd so,"
4582,MAY,"Will sour to envy, and with jealous skill"
4583,MAY,Will pry to learn the thing that none may know.
4584,MAY,"Answer not, nor inquire; for know that I"
4585,MAY,"The day thou seest my face far hence shall fly,"
4586,MAY,And thou anew to bitterest fate must go.'
4587,MAY,
4588,MAY,
4589,MAY,31
4590,MAY,
4591,MAY,"But Psyche said, 'Thy love is more than life;"
4592,MAY,To have thee leaveth nothing to be won:
4593,MAY,For should the noonday prove me to be wife
4594,MAY,"Even of the beauteous Eros, who is son"
4595,MAY,"Of Cypris, I coud never love thee more.'"
4596,MAY,"Whereat he fondly kisst her o'er and o'er,"
4597,MAY,And peace was 'twixt them till the night was done.

4611,JUNE,
4612,JUNE,1
4613,JUNE,
4614,JUNE,And truly need there was to the old King
4615,JUNE,For consolation: since the mournful day
4616,JUNE,"Of Psyche's fate he took no comforting,"
4617,JUNE,But only for a speedy death would pray;
4618,JUNE,And on his head his hair grew silver-white.
4619,JUNE,"--Such on life's topmost bough is sorrow's blight,"
4620,JUNE,When the stout heart is cankering to decay.
4621,JUNE,
4622,JUNE,2
4623,JUNE,
4624,JUNE,"Which when his daughters learnt, they both were quick"
4625,JUNE,Comfort and solace to their sire to lend.
4626,JUNE,But as not seldom they who nurse the sick
4627,JUNE,"Will take the malady from them they tend,"
4628,JUNE,So happ'd it now; for they who fail'd to cheer
4629,JUNE,"Grew sad themselves, and in that palace drear"
4630,JUNE,Increased the evil that they came to mend.
4631,JUNE,
4632,JUNE,
4633,JUNE,3
4634,JUNE,
4635,JUNE,And them the unhappy father sent to seek
4636,JUNE,"Where Psyche had been left, if they might find"
4637,JUNE,What monster held her on the savage peak;
4638,JUNE,"Or if she there had died of hunger pined,"
4639,JUNE,"And, by wild eagles stript, her scatter'd bones"
4640,JUNE,Might still be gather'd from the barren stones;
4641,JUNE,Or if her fate had left no trace behind.
4642,JUNE,
4643,JUNE,
4644,JUNE,4
4645,JUNE,
4646,JUNE,So just upon this time her sisters both
4647,JUNE,Climb'd on the cliff that hung o'er Psyche's vale;
4648,JUNE,"And finding there no sign, to leave were loth"
4649,JUNE,Ere well assured she lurk'd not within hail.
4650,JUNE,"So calling loud her name, 'Psyche!' they cried,"
4651,JUNE,"'Psyche, O Psyche!' and when none replied"
4652,JUNE,They sank upon the rocks to weep and wail.
4653,JUNE,
4654,JUNE,
4655,JUNE,5
4656,JUNE,
4657,JUNE,"But Psyche heard their voices where she sat,"
4658,JUNE,And summoning the Zephyr bade him fleet
4659,JUNE,Those mourners down unto the grassy plat
4660,JUNE,"'Midst of her garden, where she had her seat."
4661,JUNE,Then from the dizzy steep the wondering pair
4662,JUNE,"Came swiftly sinking on his buoyant air,"
4663,JUNE,And stood upon the terrace at her feet.
4664,JUNE,
4665,JUNE,
4666,JUNE,6
4667,JUNE,
4668,JUNE,"Upsprang she then, and kiss'd them and embraced,"
4669,JUNE,"And said 'Lo, here am I, I whom ye mourn."
4670,JUNE,"I am not dead, nor tortured, nor disgraced,"
4671,JUNE,But blest above all days since I was born:
4672,JUNE,Wherefore be glad. Enter my home and see
4673,JUNE,"How little cause has been to grieve for me,"
4674,JUNE,And my desertion on the rocks forlorn.'
4675,JUNE,
4676,JUNE,
4677,JUNE,7
4678,JUNE,
4679,JUNE,"So entering by the golden gate, or e'er"
4680,JUNE,"The marvel of their hither flight had waned,"
4681,JUNE,"Fresh wonder took them now, for everywhere"
4682,JUNE,Their eyes that lit on beauty were enchain'd;
4683,JUNE,"And Psyche's airy service, as she bade,"
4684,JUNE,"Perform'd its magic office, and display'd"
4685,JUNE,The riches of the palace where she reign'd.
4686,JUNE,
4687,JUNE,
4688,JUNE,8
4689,JUNE,
4690,JUNE,"And through the perfumed chambers they were led,"
4691,JUNE,"And bathed therein; and after, set to sup,"
4692,JUNE,"Were upon dreamlike delicacies fed,"
4693,JUNE,And wine more precious than its golden cup.
4694,JUNE,"Till seeing nothing lack'd and naught was theirs,"
4695,JUNE,"Their happiness fell from them unawares,"
4696,JUNE,And bitter envy in their hearts sprang up.
4697,JUNE,
4698,JUNE,
4699,JUNE,9
4700,JUNE,
4701,JUNE,"At last one said 'Psyche, since not alone"
4702,JUNE,"Thou livest here in joy, as well we wot,"
4703,JUNE,"Who is the man who should these wonders own,"
4704,JUNE,"Or god, I say, and still appeareth not?"
4705,JUNE,"What is his name? What rank and guise hath he,"
4706,JUNE,"Whom winds and spirits serve, who honoureth thee"
4707,JUNE,Above all others in thy blissful lot?'
4708,JUNE,
4709,JUNE,
4710,JUNE,10
4711,JUNE,
4712,JUNE,But Psyche when that wistful speech she heard
4713,JUNE,Was ware of all her spouse had warn'd her of:
4714,JUNE,"And uttering a disingenuous word,"
4715,JUNE,Said 'A youth yet unbearded is my love;
4716,JUNE,"He goeth hunting on the plains to-day,"
4717,JUNE,And with his dogs hath wander'd far away;
4718,JUNE,And not till eve can he return above.'
4719,JUNE,
4720,JUNE,
4721,JUNE,11
4722,JUNE,
4723,JUNE,"Then fearing to be nearer plied, she rose"
4724,JUNE,"And brought her richest jewels one by one,"
4725,JUNE,Bidding them choose and take whate'er they chose;
4726,JUNE,And beckoning the Zephyr spake anon
4727,JUNE,That he should waft her sisters to the peak;
4728,JUNE,"The which he did, and, ere they more coud speak,"
4729,JUNE,"They rose on high, and in the wind were gone."
4730,JUNE,
4731,JUNE,
4732,JUNE,12
4733,JUNE,
4734,JUNE,"Nor till again they came upon the road,"
4735,JUNE,Which from the mountain shoulder o'er the plain
4736,JUNE,"Led to the city of their sire's abode,"
4737,JUNE,"Found they their tongues, though full of high disdain"
4738,JUNE,"Their hearts were, but kept silence, till the strength"
4739,JUNE,Of pride and envious hatred burst at length
4740,JUNE,"In voice, and thus the elder gan complain:"
4741,JUNE,
4742,JUNE,
4743,JUNE,13
4744,JUNE,
4745,JUNE,'Cruel and unjust fortune! that of three
4746,JUNE,"Sisters, whose being from one fountain well'd,"
4747,JUNE,"Exalts the last so high from her degree,"
4748,JUNE,And leaves the first to be so far excel'd.
4749,JUNE,My husband is a poor and niggard churl
4750,JUNE,"To him, whoe'er he be, that loves the girl."
4751,JUNE,Oh! in what godlike state her house is held!'
4752,JUNE,
4753,JUNE,
4754,JUNE,14
4755,JUNE,
4756,JUNE,"'Ay,' said the other, 'to a gouty loon"
4757,JUNE,Am I not wedded? Lo! thy hurt is mine:
4758,JUNE,"But never call me woman more, if soon"
4759,JUNE,I cannot lure her from her height divine.
4760,JUNE,"Nay, she shall need her cunning wit to save"
4761,JUNE,The wealth of which so grudgingly she gave;
4762,JUNE,Wherefore thy hand and heart with me combine.
4763,JUNE,
4764,JUNE,
4765,JUNE,15
4766,JUNE,
4767,JUNE,"'She but received us out of pride, to show"
4768,JUNE,"Her state, well deeming that her happiness"
4769,JUNE,Was little worth while there was none to know;
4770,JUNE,So is our lot uninjured if none guess.
4771,JUNE,"Reveal we nothing therefore, but the while"
4772,JUNE,"Together scheme this wanton to beguile,"
4773,JUNE,And bring her boasting godhead to distress.'
4774,JUNE,
4775,JUNE,
4776,JUNE,16
4777,JUNE,
4778,JUNE,"So fresh disordering their dress and hair,"
4779,JUNE,"With loud lament they to their sire return,"
4780,JUNE,"Telling they found not Psyche anywhere,"
4781,JUNE,And of her sure mischance could nothing learn:
4782,JUNE,"And with that lie the wounded man they slew,"
4783,JUNE,Hiding the saving truth which well they knew;
4784,JUNE,Nor did his piteous grief their heart concern.
4785,JUNE,
4786,JUNE,
4787,JUNE,17
4788,JUNE,
4789,JUNE,Meanwhile her unknown lover did not cease
4790,JUNE,To warn poor Psyche how her sisters plan'd
4791,JUNE,To undermine her love and joy and peace;
4792,JUNE,"And urged how well she might their wiles withstand,"
4793,JUNE,By keeping them from her delight aloof:
4794,JUNE,"For better is security than proof,"
4795,JUNE,And malice held afar than near at hand.
4796,JUNE,
4797,JUNE,
4798,JUNE,18
4799,JUNE,
4800,JUNE,"'And, dearest wife,' he said, 'since 'tis not long"
4801,JUNE,"Ere one will come to share thy secrecy,"
4802,JUNE,And be thy babe and mine; let nothing wrong
4803,JUNE,The happy months of thy maternity.
4804,JUNE,"If thou keep trust, then shalt thou see thy child"
4805,JUNE,"A god; but if to pry thou be beguiled,"
4806,JUNE,The lot of both is death and misery.'
4807,JUNE,
4808,JUNE,
4809,JUNE,19
4810,JUNE,
4811,JUNE,"Then Psyche's simple heart was fill'd with joy,"
4812,JUNE,"And counting to herself the months and days,"
4813,JUNE,"Look'd for the time, when she should bear a boy"
4814,JUNE,To be her growing stay and godlike praise.
4815,JUNE,"And 'O be sure,' she said, 'be sure, my pride"
4816,JUNE,"Having so rich a promise cannot slide,"
4817,JUNE,Even if my love coud fail which thee obeys.'
4818,JUNE,
4819,JUNE,
4820,JUNE,20
4821,JUNE,
4822,JUNE,"And so most happily her life went by,"
4823,JUNE,In thoughts of love dear to her new estate;
4824,JUNE,"Until at length the evil day drew nigh,"
4825,JUNE,"When now her sisters, joined in jealous hate,"
4826,JUNE,"Set forth again, and plotted by the way"
4827,JUNE,How they might best allure her to betray
4828,JUNE,Her secret; with what he their angle bait.
4829,JUNE,
4830,JUNE,
4831,JUNE,21
4832,JUNE,
4833,JUNE,"That night her husband spake to her, and said"
4834,JUNE,"'Psyche, thy sisters come: and when they climb"
4835,JUNE,The peak they will not tarry to be sped
4836,JUNE,"Down by the Zephyr, as that other time,"
4837,JUNE,But winging to the wind will cast themselves
4838,JUNE,"Out in the air, and on the rocky shelves"
4839,JUNE,"Be dasht, and pay the penalty of crime."
4840,JUNE,
4841,JUNE,
4842,JUNE,22
4843,JUNE,
4844,JUNE,"'So let it be, and so shall we be saved.'"
4845,JUNE,Which meditated vengeance of his fear
4846,JUNE,"When Psyche heard, now for their life she craved,"
4847,JUNE,Whose mere distress erewhile had toucht her near.
4848,JUNE,"Around her lover's neck her arms she threw,"
4849,JUNE,"And pleaded for them by her faith so true,"
4850,JUNE,Although they went on doom in judgment clear.
4851,JUNE,
4852,JUNE,
4853,JUNE,23
4854,JUNE,
4855,JUNE,In terror of bloodguiltiness she now
4856,JUNE,"Forgot all other danger; she adjured,"
4857,JUNE,Or using playfulness deep sobs would plow
4858,JUNE,"Her soft entreaties, not to be endured:"
4859,JUNE,Till he at last was fain once more to grant
4860,JUNE,"The service of the Zephyr, to enchant"
4861,JUNE,That wicked couple from their fate assured.
4862,JUNE,
4863,JUNE,
4864,JUNE,24
4865,JUNE,
4866,JUNE,So ere 'twas noon were noises at the door
4867,JUNE,Of knocking loud and voices high in glee;
4868,JUNE,Such as within that vale never before
4869,JUNE,"Had been, and now seem'd most unmeet to be."
4870,JUNE,"And Psyche blush'd, though being alone, and rose"
4871,JUNE,To meet her sisters and herself unclose
4872,JUNE,The gate that made them of her palace free.
4873,JUNE,
4874,JUNE,
4875,JUNE,25
4876,JUNE,
4877,JUNE,"Fondly she kiss'd them, and with kindly cheer"
4878,JUNE,Sought to amuse; and they with outward smile
4879,JUNE,"O'ermask'd their hate, and called her sweet and dear,"
4880,JUNE,Finding affection easy to beguile:
4881,JUNE,"And all was smooth, until at last one said"
4882,JUNE,"'Tell us, I pray, to whom 'tis thou art wed;"
4883,JUNE,"'Mong gods or men, what is his rank and style?"
4884,JUNE,
4885,JUNE,
4886,JUNE,26
4887,JUNE,
4888,JUNE,"'Thou canst not think to hide the truth from us,"
4889,JUNE,"Who knew thy peevish sorrows when a maid,"
4890,JUNE,"And see thee now so glad and rapturous,"
4891,JUNE,As changed from what thou wert as light from shade;
4892,JUNE,"Thy jewels, too, the palace of a king,"
4893,JUNE,"Nor least the serviceable spiriting,"
4894,JUNE,By everything thy secret is betray'd:
4895,JUNE,
4896,JUNE,
4897,JUNE,27
4898,JUNE,
4899,JUNE,'And yet thou talkest of thy wondrous man
4900,JUNE,No more than if his face thou didst not know.'
4901,JUNE,"At which incontinently she began,"
4902,JUNE,"Forgetful of her word a month ago,"
4903,JUNE,"Answering 'A merchant rich, of middle age,"
4904,JUNE,My husband is; and o'er his features sage
4905,JUNE,His temples are already touch'd with snow.
4906,JUNE,
4907,JUNE,
4908,JUNE,28
4909,JUNE,
4910,JUNE,'But 'gainst his wish since hither ye were brought
4911,JUNE,'Twere best depart.' Then her accustom'd spell
4912,JUNE,Sped them upon the summit quick as thought;
4913,JUNE,And being alone her doing pleased her well:
4914,JUNE,So was she vext to find her love at night
4915,JUNE,"More sad than ever, of her sisters' spite"
4916,JUNE,Speaking as one that coud the end foretell.
4917,JUNE,
4918,JUNE,
4919,JUNE,29
4920,JUNE,
4921,JUNE,"'And ere long,' said he, 'they will spy again:"
4922,JUNE,Let them be dash'd upon the rocks and die;
4923,JUNE,"'Tis they must come to death or thou to pain,"
4924,JUNE,"To separation, Psyche, thou and I;"
4925,JUNE,"Nay, and our babe to ill. I therefore crave"
4926,JUNE,"Thou wilt not even once more these vipers save,"
4927,JUNE,Nor to thy love his only boon deny.'
4928,JUNE,
4929,JUNE,
4930,JUNE,30
4931,JUNE,
4932,JUNE,But Psyche would not think her sisters' crime
4933,JUNE,"So gross and strange, nor coud her danger see;"
4934,JUNE,"Since 'twere so easy, if at any time"
4935,JUNE,"They show'd the venom of their hearts, that she"
4936,JUNE,Should fan them off upon the willing gust.
4937,JUNE,"So she refused, and claiming truer trust,"
4938,JUNE,Would in no wise unto their death agree.

4944,JULY,1
4945,JULY,
4946,JULY,"'What think you, sister:' thus one envious fiend"
4947,JULY,"To other spake upon their homeward route,"
4948,JULY,'What of the story that our wit hath glean'd
4949,JULY,"Of this mysterious lover, who can shoot"
4950,JULY,"In thirty days from beardless youth to prime,"
4951,JULY,"With wisdom in his face before his time,"
4952,JULY,And snowy locks upon his head to boot?
4953,JULY,
4954,JULY,
4955,JULY,2
4956,JULY,
4957,JULY,"'Ay,' said the other, 'true, she lied not well;"

4960,JULY,"To whom she is wedded, one she cannot see."
4961,JULY,"'Tis that I fear; for if 'tis so, her child"

4966,JULY,3
4967,JULY,

4970,JULY,"Yet not to rest, but of their plots occult"
4971,JULY,Sat whispering on their beds; and ere 'twas light
4972,JULY,Resolving on the deed coud not defer;
4973,JULY,"But roused the sleeping house with sudden stir,"
4974,JULY,And sallied forth alone to work their spite.
4975,JULY,
4976,JULY,
4977,JULY,4
4978,JULY,
4979,JULY,"And with the noon were climb'd upon the peak,"
4980,JULY,And swam down on the Zephyr as before;
4981,JULY,But now with piercing cry and doleful shriek
4982,JULY,"They force their entrance through the golden door,"
4983,JULY,Feigning the urgency of bitter truth;
4984,JULY,"Such as deforms a friendly face with ruth,"
4985,JULY,When kindness may not hide ill tidings more.
4986,JULY,
4987,JULY,
4988,JULY,5
4989,JULY,
4990,JULY,"Then Psyche when she heard their wailful din,"
4991,JULY,And saw their countenances wan and worn
4992,JULY,"With travel, vigil, and disfiguring sin,"
4993,JULY,"Their hair dishevel'd and their habits torn,"
4994,JULY,For trembling scarce coud ask what ill had hapt;
4995,JULY,"And they alert with joy to see her trapt,"
4996,JULY,"Launch'd forth amain, and on their drift were borne."
4997,JULY,

5000,JULY,
5001,JULY,"'O Psyche, happiest certainly and blest"
5002,JULY,"Up to this hour,' they said, 'thou surely wert,"
5003,JULY,Being of thy fearful peril unpossest;
5004,JULY,Which now we would not tell but to avert.
5005,JULY,But we in solemn truth thy spouse have found
5006,JULY,"To be the dragon of this mountain ground,"
5007,JULY,Who holds thee here to work thy shame and hurt.

5011,JULY,
5012,JULY,'As yesternight we rode upon the wind
5013,JULY,He issued to pursue us from the wood;

5016,JULY,"Lo, now betimes the oracle, which said"

5045,JULY,"Was broken by her terror, 'it is true"
5046,JULY,That much hath hapt to stablish what ye teach;
5047,JULY,For ne'er hath it been granted me to view
5048,JULY,"My husband; and, for aught I know, he may"
5049,JULY,"Be even that cruel dragon, which ye say"
5050,JULY,Peer'd at you from the forest to pursue.
5051,JULY,
5052,JULY,
5053,JULY,11
5054,JULY,
5055,JULY,''Tis sure that scarcely can I win his grace
5056,JULY,To see you here; and still he mischief vows
5057,JULY,"If ever I should ask to see his face,"
5058,JULY,"Which, coming in the dark, he ne'er allows."
5059,JULY,"Therefore, if ye can help, of pity show,"
5060,JULY,"Since doubt I must, how I may come to know"
5061,JULY,What kind of spirit it is that is my spouse.'
5062,JULY,
5063,JULY,
5064,JULY,12
5065,JULY,
5066,JULY,Then to her cue the younger was afore:
5067,JULY,"'Hide thou a razor,' cried she, 'near thy bed;"
5068,JULY,"And have a lamp prepared, but whelm thereo'er"
5069,JULY,"Some cover, that no light be from it shed."
5070,JULY,"And when securely in first sleep he lies,"
5071,JULY,"Look on him well, and ere he can arise,"
5072,JULY,"Gashing his throat, cut off his hideous head.'"
5073,JULY,
5074,JULY,
5075,JULY,13
5076,JULY,
5077,JULY,"Which both persuading, off they flew content,"
5078,JULY,Divining that whate'er she was forbid
5079,JULY,"Was by her lover for her safety meant,"
5080,JULY,Which only coud be sure while he was hid.
5081,JULY,"But Psyche, to that miserable deed"
5082,JULY,"Being now already in her mind agreed,"
5083,JULY,"Wander'd alone, and knew not what she did."
5084,JULY,
5085,JULY,
5086,JULY,14
5087,JULY,
5088,JULY,"Now she would trust her lover, now in turn"
5089,JULY,Made question of his bidding as unjust;
5090,JULY,But thirsting curiosity to learn
5091,JULY,"His secret overcame her simple trust,"
5092,JULY,"O'ercame her spoken troth, o'ercame her fear;"
5093,JULY,"And she prepared, as now the hour drew near,"
5094,JULY,"The mean contrivances, nor felt disgust."
5095,JULY,
5096,JULY,
5097,JULY,15
5098,JULY,
5099,JULY,"She set the lamp beneath a chair, and cloked"
5100,JULY,Thickly its rebel lustre from the eye:
5101,JULY,"And laid the knife, to mortal keenness stroked,"
5102,JULY,"Within her reach, where she was wont to lie:"
5103,JULY,And took her place full early; but her heart
5104,JULY,"Beat fast, and stay'd her breath with sudden start,"
5105,JULY,Feeling her lover's arm laid fond thereby.
5106,JULY,
5107,JULY,
5108,JULY,16
5109,JULY,
5110,JULY,"But when at last he slept, then she arose,"
5111,JULY,All faint and tremulous: and though it be
5112,JULY,That wrong betrayeth innocence with shews
5113,JULY,"Of novelty, its guilt from shame to free,"
5114,JULY,Yet 'twas for shame her hand so strangely shook
5115,JULY,"That held the steel, and from the cloke that took"
5116,JULY,"The lamp, and raised it o'er the bed to see."
5117,JULY,
5118,JULY,
5119,JULY,17
5120,JULY,
5121,JULY,She had some fear she might not well discern
5122,JULY,By that small flame a monster in the gloom;
5123,JULY,"When lo! the air about her seem'd to burn,"
5124,JULY,And bright celestial radiance fill'd the room.
5125,JULY,"Too plainly O she saw, O fair to see!"
5126,JULY,"Eros, 'twas Eros' self, her lover, he,"
5127,JULY,"The God of love, reveal'd in deathless bloom."
5128,JULY,
5129,JULY,
5130,JULY,18
5131,JULY,
5132,JULY,Her fainting strength forsook her; on her knees
5133,JULY,Down by the bed she sank; the shameless knife
5134,JULY,"Fell flashing, and her heart took thought to seize"
5135,JULY,"Its desperate haft, and end her wicked life."
5136,JULY,Yet coud she not her loving eyes withdraw
5137,JULY,"From her fair sleeping lover, whom she saw"
5138,JULY,Only to know she was no more his wife.
5139,JULY,
5140,JULY,
5141,JULY,19
5142,JULY,
5143,JULY,"O treasure of all treasures, late her own!"
5144,JULY,"O loss above all losses, lost for aye!"
5145,JULY,Since there was no repentance coud atone
5146,JULY,"For her dishonour, nor her fate withstay."
5147,JULY,But yet 'twas joy to have her love in sight;
5148,JULY,"And, to the rapture yielding while she might,"
5149,JULY,She gazed upon his body where he lay.
5150,JULY,
5151,JULY,
5152,JULY,20
5153,JULY,
5154,JULY,"Above all mortal beauty, as was hers,"
5155,JULY,She saw a rival; but if passion's heart
5156,JULY,"Be rightly read by subtle questioners,"
5157,JULY,It owns a wanton and a gentler part.
5158,JULY,"And Psyche wonder'd, noting every sign"
5159,JULY,"By which the immortal God, her spouse divine,"
5160,JULY,Betray'd the image of our earthly art;
5161,JULY,
5162,JULY,
5163,JULY,21
5164,JULY,
5165,JULY,"His thickly curling hair, his ruddy cheeks,"
5166,JULY,"And pouting lips, his soft and dimpl'd chin,"
5167,JULY,"The full and cushion'd eye, that idly speaks"
5168,JULY,"Of self-content and vanity within,"
5169,JULY,"The forward, froward ear, and smooth to touch"
5170,JULY,"His body sleek, but rounded overmuch"
5171,JULY,For dignity of mind and pride akin.
5172,JULY,
5173,JULY,
5174,JULY,22
5175,JULY,
5176,JULY,"She noted that the small irradiant wings,"
5177,JULY,"That from his shoulders lay along at rest,"
5178,JULY,"Were yet disturb'd with airy quiverings,"
5179,JULY,As if some wakeful spirit his blood possest;
5180,JULY,"She feared he was awaking, but they kept"
5181,JULY,"Their sweet commotion still, and still he slept,"
5182,JULY,And still she gazed with never-tiring zest.
5183,JULY,
5184,JULY,
5185,JULY,23
5186,JULY,
5187,JULY,And now the colour of her pride and joy
5188,JULY,"Outflush'd the hue of Eros; she, so cold,"
5189,JULY,"To have fired the passion of the heartless boy,"
5190,JULY,Whom none in heaven or earth were found to hold!
5191,JULY,"Psyche, the earthborn, to be prized above"
5192,JULY,"The heavenly Graces by the God of love,"
5193,JULY,And worshipt by his wantonness untold!
5194,JULY,
5195,JULY,
5196,JULY,24
5197,JULY,
5198,JULY,"Nay, for that very thing she loved him more,"
5199,JULY,More than herself her sweet self's complement:
5200,JULY,Until the sight of him again upbore
5201,JULY,"Her courage, and renew'd her vigour spent."
5202,JULY,"And looking now around, she first espied"
5203,JULY,"Where at the bed's foot, cast in haste aside,"
5204,JULY,"Lay his full quiver, and his bow unbent."
5205,JULY,
5206,JULY,
5207,JULY,25
5208,JULY,
5209,JULY,"One of those darts, of which she had heard so oft,"
5210,JULY,She took to try if 'twas so very keen;
5211,JULY,And held its point against her finger soft
5212,JULY,"So gently, that to touch it scarce was seen;"
5213,JULY,"Yet was she sharply prickt, and felt the fire"
5214,JULY,Run through her veins; and now a strange desire
5215,JULY,"Troubl'd her heart, which ne'er before had been:"
5216,JULY,
5217,JULY,
5218,JULY,26
5219,JULY,
5220,JULY,"Straight sprang she to her lover on the bed,"
5221,JULY,"And kisst his cheek, and was not satisfied:"
5222,JULY,"When, O the lamp, held ill-balanced o'erhead,"
5223,JULY,One drop of burning oil spill'd from its side
5224,JULY,"On Eros' naked shoulder as he slept,"
5225,JULY,Who waken'd by the sudden smart uplept
5226,JULY,"Upon the floor, and all the mischief eyed."
5227,JULY,
5228,JULY,
5229,JULY,27
5230,JULY,
5231,JULY,"With nervous speed he seized his bow, and past"
5232,JULY,Out of the guilty chamber at a bound;
5233,JULY,"But Psyche, following his flight as fast,"
5234,JULY,"Caught him, and crying threw her arms around:"
5235,JULY,Till coming to the court he rose in air;
5236,JULY,"And she, close clinging in her last despair,"
5237,JULY,"Was dragg'd, and then lost hold and fell to ground."
5238,JULY,
5239,JULY,
5240,JULY,28
5241,JULY,
5242,JULY,"Wailing she fell; but he, upon the roof"
5243,JULY,"Staying his feet, awhile his flight delay'd:"
5244,JULY,And turning to her as he stood aloof
5245,JULY,"Beside a cypress, whose profoundest shade"
5246,JULY,Drank the reflections of the dreamy night
5247,JULY,"In its stiff pinnacle, the nimble light"
5248,JULY,Of million stars upon his body play'd:
5249,JULY,
5250,JULY,
5251,JULY,29
5252,JULY,
5253,JULY,"'O simple-hearted Psyche,' thus he spake,"
5254,JULY,"And she upraised her piteous eyes and hands,"
5255,JULY,"'O simple-hearted Psyche, for thy sake"
5256,JULY,I dared to break my mother's stern commands;
5257,JULY,And gave thee godlike marriage in the place
5258,JULY,"Of vilest shame; and, not to hurt thy grace,"
5259,JULY,"Spared thee my arrows, which no heart withstands."
5260,JULY,
5261,JULY,
5262,JULY,30
5263,JULY,
5264,JULY,"'But thou, for doubt I was some evil beast,"
5265,JULY,"Hast mock'd the warnings of my love, to spy"
5266,JULY,"Upon my secret, which concern'd thee least,"
5267,JULY,Seeing that thy joy was never touch'd thereby.
5268,JULY,"By faithless prying thou hast work'd thy fall,"
5269,JULY,"And, even as I foretold thee, losest all"
5270,JULY,For looking on thy happiness too nigh:
5271,JULY,
5272,JULY,
5273,JULY,31
5274,JULY,
5275,JULY,'Which loss may be thine ample punishment.
5276,JULY,"But to those fiends, by whom thou wert misled,"
5277,JULY,Go tell each one in turn that I have sent
5278,JULY,"This message, that I love her in thy stead;"
5279,JULY,And bid them by their love haste hither soon.'
5280,JULY,Whereat he fled; and Psyche in a swoon
5281,JULY,Fell back upon the marble floor as dead.
5282,JULY,
5283,JULY,
5284,AUGUST,AUGUST
5285,AUGUST,
5286,AUGUST,
5287,AUGUST,1
5288,AUGUST,
5289,AUGUST,When from the lowest ebbing of her blood
5290,AUGUST,"The fluttering pulses thrill'd and swell'd again,"
5291,AUGUST,Her stricken heart recovering force to flood
5292,AUGUST,"With life the sunken conduits of her brain,"
5293,AUGUST,"Then Psyche, where she had fallen, numb and cold"
5294,AUGUST,"Arose, but scarce her quaking sense control'd,"
5295,AUGUST,Seeing the couch where she that night had lain.
5296,AUGUST,
5297,AUGUST,
5298,AUGUST,2
5299,AUGUST,
5300,AUGUST,The level sunbeams search'd the grassy ground
5301,AUGUST,For diamond dewdrops. Ah! was this the place?
5302,AUGUST,"Where was the court, her home? she look'd around"
5303,AUGUST,And question'd with her memory for a space.
5304,AUGUST,"There was the cypress, there the well-known wood,"
5305,AUGUST,"That wall'd the spot: 'twas here her palace stood,"
5306,AUGUST,As surely as 'twas vanish'd without trace.
5307,AUGUST,
5308,AUGUST,
5309,AUGUST,3
5310,AUGUST,
5311,AUGUST,Was all a dream? To think that all was dreamt
5312,AUGUST,Were now the happier thought; but arguing o'er
5313,AUGUST,"That dream it was, she fell from her attempt,"
5314,AUGUST,Feeling the wifely burden that she bore.
5315,AUGUST,"Nay, true, 'twas true. She had had all and lost;"
5316,AUGUST,"The joy, the reckless wrong, the heavy cost"
5317,AUGUST,"Were hers, the dead end now, and woe in store."
5318,AUGUST,
5319,AUGUST,
5320,AUGUST,4
5321,AUGUST,
5322,AUGUST,What to be done? Fainting and shelterless
5323,AUGUST,Upon the mountain it were death to bide:
5324,AUGUST,"And harbour knew she none, where her distress"
5325,AUGUST,"Might comfort find, or love's dishonour hide;"
5326,AUGUST,Nor felt she any dread like that of home:
5327,AUGUST,"Yet forth she must, albeit to rove and roam"
5328,AUGUST,An outcast o'er the country far and wide.
5329,AUGUST,
5330,AUGUST,
5331,AUGUST,5
5332,AUGUST,
5333,AUGUST,Anon she marvel'd noting from the vale
5334,AUGUST,"A path lead downward to the plain below,"
5335,AUGUST,"Crossing the very site, whereon the pale"
5336,AUGUST,Of all her joy had stood few hours ago;
5337,AUGUST,"A run of mountain beasts, that keep their track"
5338,AUGUST,"Through generations, and for ages back"
5339,AUGUST,Had trod the self-same footing to and fro.
5340,AUGUST,
5341,AUGUST,
5342,AUGUST,6
5343,AUGUST,
5344,AUGUST,"That would she try: so forth she took her way,"
5345,AUGUST,"Turning her face from the dishonour'd dell,"
5346,AUGUST,"Adown the broadening eastward lawns, which lay"
5347,AUGUST,"In gentle slant, till suddenly they fell"
5348,AUGUST,"In sheer cliff: whence the path that went around,"
5349,AUGUST,"Clomb by the bluffs, or e'er it downward wound"
5350,AUGUST,Beneath that precipice impassable.
5351,AUGUST,
5352,AUGUST,
5353,AUGUST,7
5354,AUGUST,
5355,AUGUST,"There once she turn'd, and gazing up the slope"
5356,AUGUST,She bid the scene of all her joy adieu;
5357,AUGUST,"'Ay, and farewell,' she cried, 'farewell to hope,"
5358,AUGUST,"Since there is none will rescue me anew,"
5359,AUGUST,Who have kill'd God's perfection with a doubt.'
5360,AUGUST,"Which said, she took the path that led about,"
5361,AUGUST,And hid the upland pleasance from her view.
5362,AUGUST,
5363,AUGUST,
5364,AUGUST,8
5365,AUGUST,
5366,AUGUST,"But soon it left her, entering 'neath the shade"
5367,AUGUST,"Of cedar old and russeted tall pine,"
5368,AUGUST,"Whose mighty tops, seen from the thorny glade,"
5369,AUGUST,Belted the hills about; and now no sign
5370,AUGUST,"Had she to guide her, save the slow descent."
5371,AUGUST,"But swiftly o'er the springy floor she went,"
5372,AUGUST,And drew the odorous air like draughts of wine.
5373,AUGUST,
5374,AUGUST,
5375,AUGUST,9
5376,AUGUST,
5377,AUGUST,Then next she past a forest thick and dark
5378,AUGUST,"With heavy ilexes and platanes high,"
5379,AUGUST,And came to long lush grass; and now coud mark
5380,AUGUST,By many a token that the plain was nigh.
5381,AUGUST,When lo! a river: to whose brink at last
5382,AUGUST,"Being come, upon the bank her limbs she cast,"
5383,AUGUST,And through her sad tears watch'd the stream go by.
5384,AUGUST,
5385,AUGUST,
5386,AUGUST,10
5387,AUGUST,
5388,AUGUST,And now the thought came o'er her that in death
5389,AUGUST,"There was a cure for sorrow, that before"
5390,AUGUST,"Her eyes ran Lethe, she might take one breath"
5391,AUGUST,Of water and be freed for evermore.
5392,AUGUST,"Leaning to look into her tomb, thereon"
5393,AUGUST,"She saw the horror of her image wan,"
5394,AUGUST,And up she rose at height to leap from shore.
5395,AUGUST,
5396,AUGUST,
5397,AUGUST,11
5398,AUGUST,
5399,AUGUST,"When suddenly a mighty voice, that fell"
5400,AUGUST,"With fury on her ears, their sense to scare,"
5401,AUGUST,That bounding from the tree trunks like the yell
5402,AUGUST,"Of hundred brazen trumpets, cried 'Forbear!"
5403,AUGUST,"Forbear, fond maid, that froward step to take,"
5404,AUGUST,For life can cure the ills that love may make;
5405,AUGUST,But for the harm of death is no repair.'
5406,AUGUST,
5407,AUGUST,
5408,AUGUST,12
5409,AUGUST,
5410,AUGUST,Then looking up she saw an uncouth form
5411,AUGUST,"Perch'd on the further bank, whose parted lips"
5412,AUGUST,Volley'd their friendly warning in a storm:
5413,AUGUST,"A man he might have been, but for the tips"
5414,AUGUST,"Of horns appearing from his shaggy head,"
5415,AUGUST,"For o'er his matted beard his face was red,"
5416,AUGUST,And all his shape was manlike to the hips.
5417,AUGUST,
5418,AUGUST,
5419,AUGUST,13
5420,AUGUST,
5421,AUGUST,"In forehead low, keen eye, and nostril flat"
5422,AUGUST,"He bore the human grace in mean degree,"
5423,AUGUST,"But, set beneath his body squat and fat,"
5424,AUGUST,"Legs like a goat's, and from the hairy knee"
5425,AUGUST,"The shank fell spare; and, though crosswise he put"
5426,AUGUST,"His limbs in easeful posture, for the foot"
5427,AUGUST,The beast's divided hoof was plain to see.
5428,AUGUST,
5429,AUGUST,
5430,AUGUST,14
5431,AUGUST,
5432,AUGUST,"Him then she knew the mighty choric God,"
5433,AUGUST,The great hill-haunting and tree-loving Pan;
5434,AUGUST,Whom Zeus had laught to see when first he trod
5435,AUGUST,"Olympus, neither god nor beast nor man:"
5436,AUGUST,Who every rocky peak and snowy crest
5437,AUGUST,"Of the Aspran mountains for his own possest,"
5438,AUGUST,And all their alps with bacchic rout o'erran:
5439,AUGUST,
5440,AUGUST,
5441,AUGUST,15
5442,AUGUST,
5443,AUGUST,"Whom, when his pipe he plays on loud and sweet,"
5444,AUGUST,"And o'er the fitted reeds his moist lip flees,"
5445,AUGUST,Around in measured step with nimble feet
5446,AUGUST,Water-nymphs dance and Hamadryades:
5447,AUGUST,"And all the woodland's airy folk, who shun"
5448,AUGUST,"Man's presence, to his frolic pastime run"
5449,AUGUST,From their perennial wells and sacred trees.
5450,AUGUST,
5451,AUGUST,
5452,AUGUST,16
5453,AUGUST,
5454,AUGUST,"Now on his knee his pipe laid by, he spoke"
5455,AUGUST,"With flippant tongue, wounding unwittingly"
5456,AUGUST,The heart he sought to cheer with jest and joke.
5457,AUGUST,"'And what hast thou to do with misery,'"
5458,AUGUST,"He said, 'who hast such beauty as might gain"
5459,AUGUST,"The love of Eros? Cast away thy pain,"
5460,AUGUST,And give thy soul to mirth and jollity.
5461,AUGUST,
5462,AUGUST,
5463,AUGUST,17
5464,AUGUST,
5465,AUGUST,"'Thy mortal life is but a brittle vase,"
5466,AUGUST,But as thee list with wine or tears to fill;
5467,AUGUST,For all the drops therein are Ohs and Ahs
5468,AUGUST,Of joy or grief according to thy will;
5469,AUGUST,"And wouldst thou learn of me my merry way,"
5470,AUGUST,"I'd teach thee change thy lover every day,"
5471,AUGUST,And prize the cup that thou wert fain to spill.
5472,AUGUST,
5473,AUGUST,
5474,AUGUST,18
5475,AUGUST,
5476,AUGUST,"'Nay, if thou plunge thou shalt not drown nor sink,"
5477,AUGUST,"For I will to thee o'er the stream afloat,"
5478,AUGUST,And bear thee safe; and O I know a drink
5479,AUGUST,"For care, that makes sweet music in the throat."
5480,AUGUST,"Come live with me, my love; I'll cure thy chance:"
5481,AUGUST,"For I can laugh and quaff, and pipe and dance,"
5482,AUGUST,"Swim like a fish, and caper like a goat.'"
5483,AUGUST,
5484,AUGUST,
5485,AUGUST,19
5486,AUGUST,
5487,AUGUST,"Speaking, his brute divinity explored"
5488,AUGUST,The secret of her silence; and old Pan
5489,AUGUST,Grew kind and told her of a shallow ford
5490,AUGUST,"Where lower down the stream o'er pebbles ran,"
5491,AUGUST,And one might pass at ease with ankles dry:
5492,AUGUST,"Whither she went, and crossing o'er thereby,"
5493,AUGUST,Her lonely wanderings through the isle began.
5494,AUGUST,
5495,AUGUST,
5496,AUGUST,20
5497,AUGUST,
5498,AUGUST,"But none coud tell, no, nor herself had told"
5499,AUGUST,"Where food she found, or shelter through the land"
5500,AUGUST,By day or night; until by fate control'd
5501,AUGUST,"She came by steep ways to the southern strand,"
5502,AUGUST,"Where, sacred to the Twins and Britomart,"
5503,AUGUST,"Pent in its rocky theatre apart,"
5504,AUGUST,A little town stood on the level sand.
5505,AUGUST,
5506,AUGUST,
5507,AUGUST,21
5508,AUGUST,
5509,AUGUST,'Twas where her younger sister's husband reign'd:
5510,AUGUST,"And Psyche to the palace gate drew near,"
5511,AUGUST,"Helplessly still by Eros' hest constrain'd,"
5512,AUGUST,And knocking begg'd to see her sister dear;
5513,AUGUST,"But when in state stepp'd down that haughty queen,"
5514,AUGUST,"And saw the wan face spent with tears and teen,"
5515,AUGUST,"She smiled, and said 'Psyche, what dost thou here?'"
5516,AUGUST,
5517,AUGUST,
5518,AUGUST,22
5519,AUGUST,
5520,AUGUST,"Then Psyche told how, having well employ'd"
5521,AUGUST,"Their means, and done their bidding not amiss,"
5522,AUGUST,"Looking on him her hand would have destroy'd,"

5524,AUGUST,"Even as she kisst, a drop of burning oil"
5525,AUGUST,"Fall'n from the lamp had served her scheme to foil,"
5526,AUGUST,Discovering her in vision of her bliss;

5528,AUGUST,
5529,AUGUST,23
5530,AUGUST,
5531,AUGUST,"Wherewith the god stung, like a startled bird"
5532,AUGUST,"Arose in air, and she fell back in swoon;"
5533,AUGUST,"'But ere he parted,' said she, 'he confer'd"
5534,AUGUST,On thee the irrecoverable boon
5535,AUGUST,"By prying lost to me: _Go tell_, he said,"
5536,AUGUST,"_Thy sister that I love her in thy stead,"
5537,AUGUST,And bid her by her love haste hither soon_.
5538,AUGUST,
5539,AUGUST,
5540,AUGUST,24
5541,AUGUST,
5542,AUGUST,"Which when that heart of malice heard, it took"
5543,AUGUST,The jealous fancy of her silly lust:
5544,AUGUST,And pitilessly with triumphant look
5545,AUGUST,"She drank the flattery, and gave full trust;"
5546,AUGUST,"And leaving Psyche ere she more coud tell,"
5547,AUGUST,"Ran off to bid her spouse for aye farewell,"
5548,AUGUST,And in his ear this ready lie she thrust:
5549,AUGUST,
5550,AUGUST,
5551,AUGUST,25
5552,AUGUST,
5553,AUGUST,"'My dearest sister Psyche, she whose fate"
5554,AUGUST,"We mourn'd, hath reappear'd alive and hale,"
5555,AUGUST,But brings sad news; my father dies: full late
5556,AUGUST,"These tidings come, but love may yet avail;"
5557,AUGUST,"Let me be gone.' And stealing blind consent,"
5558,AUGUST,"Forth on that well-remember'd road she went,"
5559,AUGUST,And climb'd upon the peak above the dale.
5560,AUGUST,
5561,AUGUST,
5562,AUGUST,26
5563,AUGUST,
5564,AUGUST,"There on the topmost rock, where Psyche first"
5565,AUGUST,"Had by her weeping sire been left to die,"
5566,AUGUST,"She stood a moment, in her hope accurst"
5567,AUGUST,Being happy; and the cliffs took up her cry
5568,AUGUST,"With chuckling mockery from her tongue above,"
5569,AUGUST,"_Zephyr, sweet Zephyr, waft me to my love_!"
5570,AUGUST,When off she lept upon his wings to fly.
5571,AUGUST,
5572,AUGUST,
5573,AUGUST,27
5574,AUGUST,
5575,AUGUST,"But as a dead stone, from a height let fall,"
5576,AUGUST,Silent and straight is gather'd by the force
5577,AUGUST,"Of earth's vast mass upon its weight so small,"
5578,AUGUST,In speed increasing as it nears its source
5579,AUGUST,Of motion--by which law all things soe'er
5580,AUGUST,"Are clutch'd and dragg'd and held--so fell she there,"
5581,AUGUST,"Like a dead stone, down in her headlong course."
5582,AUGUST,
5583,AUGUST,
5584,AUGUST,28
5585,AUGUST,
5586,AUGUST,The disregardful silence heard her strike
5587,AUGUST,Upon the solid crags; her dismal shriek
5588,AUGUST,Rang on the rocks and died out laughter-like
5589,AUGUST,Along the vale in hurried trebles weak;
5590,AUGUST,"And soon upon her, from their skiey haunt"
5591,AUGUST,Fell to their feast the great birds bald and gaunt
5592,AUGUST,And gorged on her fair flesh with bloody beak.
5593,AUGUST,
5594,AUGUST,
5595,AUGUST,29
5596,AUGUST,
5597,AUGUST,"But Psyche, when her sister was gone forth,"
5598,AUGUST,Went out again her wandering way to take:
5599,AUGUST,"And following a stream that led her north,"
5600,AUGUST,"After some days she pass'd the Corian Lake,"
5601,AUGUST,"Whereby Athena's temple stands, and he"
5602,AUGUST,Who traverses the isle from sea to sea
5603,AUGUST,May by the plain his shortest journey make:
5604,AUGUST,
5605,AUGUST,
5606,AUGUST,30
5607,AUGUST,
5608,AUGUST,Till on the northern coast arrived she came
5609,AUGUST,"Upon a city built about a port,"
5610,AUGUST,"The which she knew, soon as she heard the name,"
5611,AUGUST,Was where her elder sister had her court;
5612,AUGUST,"To whom, as Eros had commanded her,"
5613,AUGUST,She now in turn became the messenger
5614,AUGUST,"Of vengeful punishment, that fell not short:"
5615,AUGUST,
5616,AUGUST,
5617,AUGUST,31
5618,AUGUST,
5619,AUGUST,"For she too hearing gan her heart exalt,"
5620,AUGUST,"Nor pity felt for Psyche's tears and moans,"
5621,AUGUST,"But, fellow'd with that other in her fault,"
5622,AUGUST,Follow'd her to her fate upon the stones;
5623,AUGUST,And from the peak leaping like her below
5624,AUGUST,"The self-same way unto the self-same woe,"
5625,AUGUST,Lay dasht to death upon her sister's bones.

5810,SEPTEMBER,As soon as if he had but dipt for prey:
5811,SEPTEMBER,"And now, or e'er he join'd his wailful flock,"
5812,SEPTEMBER,"Once more he stood upon the Sirens' rock,"

5819,SEPTEMBER,"Without more witness than their fatal sense,"
5820,SEPTEMBER,"So, since was nothing bitterer to endure,"
5821,SEPTEMBER,The injured goddess guess'd the full offence:
5822,SEPTEMBER,And doubted only whether first to smite
5823,SEPTEMBER,"Or Psyche for her new presumptuous flight,"
5824,SEPTEMBER,Or Eros for his disobedience.

5941,SEPTEMBER,"This Psyche,' said she, 'hath the heavenly charm,"
5942,SEPTEMBER,And will become immortal. And maybe
5943,SEPTEMBER,To marry with a woman is as well

5957,SEPTEMBER,
5958,SEPTEMBER,
5959,SEPTEMBER,30
5960,SEPTEMBER,
5961,SEPTEMBER,For having purposed she would hold no truce
5962,SEPTEMBER,"With Psyche or her son, 'twas in her mind"
5963,SEPTEMBER,"To go forthwith unto the throne of Zeus,"
5964,SEPTEMBER,And beg that Hermes might be sent to find
5965,SEPTEMBER,The wanderer; and secure that in such quest
5966,SEPTEMBER,"He would not fail, she ponder'd but how best"

5989,OCTOBER,"With sight of their dead friends, so much they long;"
5990,OCTOBER,"So she for him, whom loss a thousandfold"

6000,OCTOBER,In pain alike to lose or venture near.
6001,OCTOBER,"And still this thought cheer'd her fatigue, that he,"
6002,OCTOBER,"Or on some hill, or by some brook or tree,"

6011,OCTOBER,Now sounding sweeter for her sorrowing:
6012,OCTOBER,"_Echo, sweet Echo, watching up on high,"
6013,OCTOBER,"Say hast thou seen to-day my love go by,"
6014,OCTOBER,Or where thou sittest by thy mossy spring?_
6015,OCTOBER,
6016,OCTOBER,
6017,OCTOBER,5
6018,OCTOBER,
6019,OCTOBER,"_Or say ye nymphs, that from the crystal rills,"
6020,OCTOBER,"When ye have bathed your limbs from morn till eve,"
6021,OCTOBER,"Flying at midnight to the bare-topt hills,"
6022,OCTOBER,"Beneath the stars your mazy dances weave,"
6023,OCTOBER,"Say, my deserter whom ye well may know"
6024,OCTOBER,"By his small wings, his quiver, and his bow,"
6025,OCTOBER,"Say, have ye seen my love, whose loss I grieve?_"
6026,OCTOBER,
6027,OCTOBER,
6028,OCTOBER,6
6029,OCTOBER,
6030,OCTOBER,Till climb'd one evening on a rocky steep
6031,OCTOBER,"Above the plain of Cisamos, that lay,"
6032,OCTOBER,"Robb'd of its golden harvest, in the deep"
6033,OCTOBER,"Mountainous shadows of the dying day,"
6034,OCTOBER,"She saw a temple, whose tall columns fair"
6035,OCTOBER,"Recall'd her home; and 'O if thou be there,"
6036,OCTOBER,"My love,' she cried, 'fly not again away.'"
6037,OCTOBER,
6038,OCTOBER,
6039,OCTOBER,7
6040,OCTOBER,
6041,OCTOBER,"Swiftly she ran, and entering by the door"
6042,OCTOBER,She stood alone within an empty fane
6043,OCTOBER,"Of great Demeter: and, behold, the floor"
6044,OCTOBER,"Was litter'd with thank-offerings of grain,"
6045,OCTOBER,With wheat and barley-sheaves together heapt
6046,OCTOBER,In holy harvest-home of them that reapt
6047,OCTOBER,The goddess plenteous gifts upon the plain;
6048,OCTOBER,
6049,OCTOBER,
6050,OCTOBER,8
6051,OCTOBER,
6052,OCTOBER,And on the tithe the tackle of the tithe
6053,OCTOBER,"Thrown by in such confusion, as are laid"
6054,OCTOBER,"Upon the swath sickle, and hook, and scythe,"
6055,OCTOBER,When midday drives the reapers to the shade.
6056,OCTOBER,"And Psyche, since had come no priestess there"
6057,OCTOBER,"To trim the temple, in her pious care"
6058,OCTOBER,"Forgat herself, and lent her duteous aid."
6059,OCTOBER,
6060,OCTOBER,
6061,OCTOBER,9
6062,OCTOBER,
6063,OCTOBER,"She drew the offerings from the midst aside,"
6064,OCTOBER,And piled the sheaves at every pillar's base;
6065,OCTOBER,"And sweeping therebetween a passage wide,"
6066,OCTOBER,Made clear of corn and chaff the temple space:
6067,OCTOBER,"As countrymen who bring their wheat to mart,"
6068,OCTOBER,Set out their show along the walls apart
6069,OCTOBER,"By their allotted stations, each in place;"
6070,OCTOBER,
6071,OCTOBER,
6072,OCTOBER,10
6073,OCTOBER,
6074,OCTOBER,"Thus she, and felt no weariness,--such strength"
6075,OCTOBER,"Hath duty to support our feeble frame,--"
6076,OCTOBER,"Till all was set in order, and at length"
6077,OCTOBER,Up to the threshold of the shrine she came:
6078,OCTOBER,"When lo! before her face with friendly smile,"
6079,OCTOBER,"Tall as a pillar of the peristyle,"
6080,OCTOBER,"The goddess stood reveal'd, and call'd her name."
6081,OCTOBER,
6082,OCTOBER,
6083,OCTOBER,11
6084,OCTOBER,
6085,OCTOBER,"'Unhappy Psyche,' said she, 'know'st thou not"
6086,OCTOBER,How Aphrodite to thy hurt is sworn?
6087,OCTOBER,"And thou, thy peril and her wrath forgot,"
6088,OCTOBER,Spendest thy thought my temple to adorn.
6089,OCTOBER,"Take better heed!'--And Psyche, at the voice"
6090,OCTOBER,"Even of so little comfort, gan rejoice,"
6091,OCTOBER,And at her feet pour'd out this prayer forlorn.
6092,OCTOBER,
6093,OCTOBER,
6094,OCTOBER,12
6095,OCTOBER,
6096,OCTOBER,"'O Gracious giver of the golden grain,"
6097,OCTOBER,"Hide me, I pray thee, from her wrath unkind:"
6098,OCTOBER,"For who can pity as canst thou my pain,"
6099,OCTOBER,"Who wert thyself a wanderer, vex'd in mind"
6100,OCTOBER,"For loss of thy dear CorÃ¨ once, whenas,"
6101,OCTOBER,"Ravisht to hell by fierce Agesilas,"
6102,OCTOBER,Thou soughtest her on earth and coudst not find.
6103,OCTOBER,
6104,OCTOBER,
6105,OCTOBER,13
6106,OCTOBER,
6107,OCTOBER,"'How coud thy feet bear thee to western night,"
6108,OCTOBER,"And where swart Libyans watch the sacred tree,"
6109,OCTOBER,"And thrice to ford o'er Achelous bright,"
6110,OCTOBER,And all the streams of beauteous Sicily?
6111,OCTOBER,"And thrice to Enna cam'st thou, thrice, they tell,"
6112,OCTOBER,"Satest athirst by Callichorus' well,"
6113,OCTOBER,Nor tookest of the spring to comfort thee.
6114,OCTOBER,
6115,OCTOBER,
6116,OCTOBER,14
6117,OCTOBER,
6118,OCTOBER,"'By that remember'd anguish of thine heart,"
6119,OCTOBER,"Lady, have pity even on me, and show"
6120,OCTOBER,Where I may find my love; and take my part
6121,OCTOBER,"For peace, I pray, against my cruel foe:"
6122,OCTOBER,"Or if thou canst not from her anger shield,"
6123,OCTOBER,Here let me lie among the sheaves conceal'd
6124,OCTOBER,Such time till forth I may in safety go.'
6125,OCTOBER,
6126,OCTOBER,
6127,OCTOBER,15
6128,OCTOBER,
6129,OCTOBER,"Demeter answer'd, 'Nay, though thou constrain"
6130,OCTOBER,"My favour with thy plea, my help must still"
6131,OCTOBER,"Be hidden, else I work for thee in vain"
6132,OCTOBER,To thwart my mighty sister in her will.
6133,OCTOBER,"Thou must fly hence: Yet though I not oppose,"
6134,OCTOBER,Less will I aid her; and if now I close
6135,OCTOBER,"My temple doors to thee, take it not ill.'"
6136,OCTOBER,
6137,OCTOBER,
6138,OCTOBER,16
6139,OCTOBER,
6140,OCTOBER,"Then Psyche's hope founder'd; as when a ship,"
6141,OCTOBER,The morrow of the gale can hardly ride
6142,OCTOBER,"The swollen seas, fetching a deeper dip"
6143,OCTOBER,"At every wave, and through her gaping side"
6144,OCTOBER,"And o'er her shattered bulwark ever drinks,"
6145,OCTOBER,"Till plunging in the watery wild she sinks,"
6146,OCTOBER,To scoop her grave beneath the crushing tide:
6147,OCTOBER,
6148,OCTOBER,
6149,OCTOBER,17
6150,OCTOBER,
6151,OCTOBER,So with each word her broken spirit drank
6152,OCTOBER,Its doom; and overwhelm'd with deep despair
6153,OCTOBER,"She turn'd away, and coming forth she sank"
6154,OCTOBER,"Silently weeping on the temple stair,"
6155,OCTOBER,"In midmost night, forspent with long turmoil:"
6156,OCTOBER,"But sleep, the gracious pursuivant of toil,"
6157,OCTOBER,"Came swiftly down, and nursed away her care."
6158,OCTOBER,
6159,OCTOBER,
6160,OCTOBER,18
6161,OCTOBER,
6162,OCTOBER,And when the sun awaked her with his beams
6163,OCTOBER,"She found new hope, that still her sorrow's cure"
6164,OCTOBER,"Lay with the gods, who in her morning dreams"
6165,OCTOBER,Had sent her comfort in a vision sure;
6166,OCTOBER,"Wherein the Cretan-born, almightiest god,"
6167,OCTOBER,"Cloud-gathering Zeus himself had seem'd to nod,"
6168,OCTOBER,And bid her with good heart her woes endure.
6169,OCTOBER,
6170,OCTOBER,
6171,OCTOBER,19
6172,OCTOBER,
6173,OCTOBER,So coming that same day unto a shrine
6174,OCTOBER,"Of Hera, she took courage and went in:"
6175,OCTOBER,And like to one that to the cell divine
6176,OCTOBER,"For favour ventures or a suit to win,"
6177,OCTOBER,"She drew anigh the altar, from her face"
6178,OCTOBER,"Wiping the tears, ere to the heavenly grace,"
6179,OCTOBER,"As thus she pray'd, she would her prayer begin."
6180,OCTOBER,
6181,OCTOBER,
6182,OCTOBER,20
6183,OCTOBER,
6184,OCTOBER,"'Most honour'd Lady, who from ancient doom"
6185,OCTOBER,"Wert made heaven's wife, and art on earth besought"
6186,OCTOBER,With gracious happiness of all to whom
6187,OCTOBER,"Thy holy wedlock hath my burden brought,"
6188,OCTOBER,"Save me from Aphrodite's fell pursuit,"
6189,OCTOBER,"And guard unto the birth Love's hapless fruit,"
6190,OCTOBER,Which she for cruel spite would bring to nought.
6191,OCTOBER,
6192,OCTOBER,
6193,OCTOBER,21
6194,OCTOBER,
6195,OCTOBER,'As once from her thou wert not shamed to take
6196,OCTOBER,"Her beauty's zone, thy beauty to enhance;"
6197,OCTOBER,"For which again Zeus loved thee, to forsake"
6198,OCTOBER,His warlike ire in faithful dalliance;
6199,OCTOBER,"Show me what means may win my Love to me,"
6200,OCTOBER,"Or how that I may come, if so may be,"
6201,OCTOBER,Within the favour of his countenance.
6202,OCTOBER,
6203,OCTOBER,
6204,OCTOBER,22
6205,OCTOBER,
6206,OCTOBER,"'If there be any place for tears or prayer,"
6207,OCTOBER,"If there be need for succour in distress,"
6208,OCTOBER,"Now is the very hour of all despair,"
6209,OCTOBER,Here is the heart of grief and bitterness.
6210,OCTOBER,"Motherly pity, bend thy face and grant"
6211,OCTOBER,"One beam of ruth to thy poor suppliant,"
6212,OCTOBER,Nor turn me from thine altar comfortless.'
6213,OCTOBER,
6214,OCTOBER,
6215,OCTOBER,23
6216,OCTOBER,
6217,OCTOBER,"Even as she pray'd a cloud spread through the cell,"
6218,OCTOBER,And 'mid the wreathings of the vapour dim
6219,OCTOBER,"The goddess grew in glory visible,"
6220,OCTOBER,Like some barbaric queen in festal trim;
6221,OCTOBER,"Such the attire and ornaments she wore,"
6222,OCTOBER,When o'er the forgÃ¨d threshold of the floor
6223,OCTOBER,Of Zeus's house she stept to visit him.
6224,OCTOBER,
6225,OCTOBER,
6226,OCTOBER,24
6227,OCTOBER,
6228,OCTOBER,"From either ear, ring'd to its piercÃ¨d lobe"
6229,OCTOBER,"A triple jewel hung, with gold enchas't;"
6230,OCTOBER,And o'er her breasts her wide ambrosial robe
6231,OCTOBER,With many a shining golden clasp was brac't;
6232,OCTOBER,The flowering on its smooth embroider'd lawn
6233,OCTOBER,Gather'd to colour where the zone was drawn
6234,OCTOBER,In fringe of golden tassels at her waist.
6235,OCTOBER,
6236,OCTOBER,
6237,OCTOBER,25
6238,OCTOBER,
6239,OCTOBER,"Her curling hair with plaited braid and brail,"
6240,OCTOBER,"Pendant or loop'd about her head divine,"
6241,OCTOBER,"Lay hidden half beneath a golden veil,"
6242,OCTOBER,Bright as the rippling ocean in sunshine:
6243,OCTOBER,"And on the ground, flashing whene'er she stept,"
6244,OCTOBER,Beneath her feet the dazzling lightnings lept
6245,OCTOBER,From the gold network of her sandals fine.
6246,OCTOBER,
6247,OCTOBER,
6248,OCTOBER,26
6249,OCTOBER,
6250,OCTOBER,Thus Hera stood in royal guise bedeckt
6251,OCTOBER,"Before poor Psyche on the stair that knelt,"
6252,OCTOBER,Whose new-nursed hope at that display was checkt
6253,OCTOBER,And all her happier thoughts gan fade and melt.
6254,OCTOBER,"She saw no kindness in such haughty mien,"
6255,OCTOBER,"And venturing not to look upon the queen,"
6256,OCTOBER,Bow'd down in woe to hear her sentence dealt.
6257,OCTOBER,
6258,OCTOBER,
6259,OCTOBER,27
6260,OCTOBER,
6261,OCTOBER,"And thus the goddess spake, 'In vain thou suest,"
6262,OCTOBER,Most miserable Psyche; though my heart
6263,OCTOBER,"Be full of hate for her whose hate thou ruest,"
6264,OCTOBER,And pride and pity move me to thy part:
6265,OCTOBER,"Yet not till Zeus make known his will, coud I,"
6266,OCTOBER,"Least of the blameless gods that dwell on high,"
6267,OCTOBER,"Assist thee, wert thou worthier than thou art."
6268,OCTOBER,
6269,OCTOBER,
6270,OCTOBER,28
6271,OCTOBER,
6272,OCTOBER,"'But know if Eros love thee, that thy hopes"
6273,OCTOBER,Should rest on him; and I would bid thee go
6274,OCTOBER,Where in his mother's house apart he mopes
6275,OCTOBER,Grieving for loss of thee in secret woe:
6276,OCTOBER,"For should he take thee back, there is no power"
6277,OCTOBER,"In earth or heaven will hurt thee from that hour,"
6278,OCTOBER,"Nay, not if Zeus himself should prove thy foe.'"
6279,OCTOBER,
6280,OCTOBER,
6281,OCTOBER,29
6282,OCTOBER,
6283,OCTOBER,"Thus saying she was gone, and Psyche now"
6284,OCTOBER,"Surprised by comfort rose and went her way,"
6285,OCTOBER,"Resolved in heart, and only wondering how"
6286,OCTOBER,'Twas possible to come where Eros lay;
6287,OCTOBER,"Since that her feet, however she might roam,"
6288,OCTOBER,Coud never travel to the heavenly home
6289,OCTOBER,"Of Love, beyond the bounds of mortal day:"
6290,OCTOBER,
6291,OCTOBER,
6292,OCTOBER,30
6293,OCTOBER,
6294,OCTOBER,Yet must she come to him. And now 'twas proved
6295,OCTOBER,"How that to Lovers, as is told in song,"
6296,OCTOBER,Seeking the way no place is far removed;
6297,OCTOBER,"Nor is there any obstacle so strong,"
6298,OCTOBER,Nor bar so fix'd that it can hinder them:
6299,OCTOBER,And how to reach heaven's gate by stratagem
6300,OCTOBER,Vex'd not the venturous heart of Psyche long.
6301,OCTOBER,
6302,OCTOBER,
6303,OCTOBER,31
6304,OCTOBER,
6305,OCTOBER,To face her enemy might well avail:
6306,OCTOBER,"Wherefore to Cypris' shrine her steps she bent,"
6307,OCTOBER,Hoping the goddess in her hate might hale
6308,OCTOBER,"Her body to the skies for punishment,"
6309,OCTOBER,Whate'er to be; yet now her fiercest wrath
6310,OCTOBER,"Seem'd happiest fortune, seeing 'twas the path"
6311,OCTOBER,Whereby alone unto her love she went.

6318,NOVEMBER,
6319,NOVEMBER,But Aphrodite to the house of Zeus
6320,NOVEMBER,"Being bound, bade beckon out her milkwhite steeds,"
6321,NOVEMBER,"Four doves, that ready to her royal use"
6322,NOVEMBER,In golden cages stood and peck'd the seeds:
6323,NOVEMBER,Best of the nimble air's high-sailing folk
6324,NOVEMBER,"That wore with pride the marking of her yoke,"
6325,NOVEMBER,And cooed in envy of her gentle needs.
6326,NOVEMBER,
6327,NOVEMBER,
6328,NOVEMBER,2
6329,NOVEMBER,
6330,NOVEMBER,"These drew in turn her chariot, when in state"
6331,NOVEMBER,Along the heaven with all her train she fared;
6332,NOVEMBER,And oft in journeying to the skiey gate
6333,NOVEMBER,"Of Zeus's palace high their flight had dared,"
6334,NOVEMBER,Which darkest vapour and thick glooms enshroud
6335,NOVEMBER,"Above all else in the perpetual cloud,"
6336,NOVEMBER,"Wherethro' to mount again they stood prepared,"
6337,NOVEMBER,
6338,NOVEMBER,
6339,NOVEMBER,3
6340,NOVEMBER,
6341,NOVEMBER,"Sleeking their feathers, by her shining car;"
6342,NOVEMBER,"The same HephÃ¦stos wrought for her, when he,"
6343,NOVEMBER,"Bruised in his hideous fall from heaven afar,"
6344,NOVEMBER,"Was nursed by Thetis, and EurynomÃ¨,"
6345,NOVEMBER,The daughter of the ever-refluent main;
6346,NOVEMBER,"With whom he dwelt till he grew sound again,"
6347,NOVEMBER,Down in a hollow cave beside the sea:
6348,NOVEMBER,
6349,NOVEMBER,
6350,NOVEMBER,4
6351,NOVEMBER,
6352,NOVEMBER,"And them for kindness done was prompt to serve,"
6353,NOVEMBER,"Forging them brooches rich in make and mode,"
6354,NOVEMBER,"Earrings, and supple chains of jointed curve,"
6355,NOVEMBER,"And other trinkets, while he there abode:"
6356,NOVEMBER,"And none of gods or men knew of his home,"
6357,NOVEMBER,But they two only; and the salt sea-foam
6358,NOVEMBER,To and fro past his cavern ever flow'd.
6359,NOVEMBER,
6360,NOVEMBER,
6361,NOVEMBER,5
6362,NOVEMBER,
6363,NOVEMBER,"'Twas then he wrought this work within the cave,"
6364,NOVEMBER,"Emboss'd with rich design, a moonÃ¨d car;"
6365,NOVEMBER,"And when return'd to heaven to Venus gave,"
6366,NOVEMBER,In form imagined like her crescent star;
6367,NOVEMBER,"Which circling nearest earth, maketh at night"
6368,NOVEMBER,To wakeful mortal men shadow and light
6369,NOVEMBER,Alone of all the stars in heaven that are.
6370,NOVEMBER,
6371,NOVEMBER,
6372,NOVEMBER,6
6373,NOVEMBER,
6374,NOVEMBER,"Two slender wheels it had, with fretted tires"
6375,NOVEMBER,"Of biting adamant, to take firm hold"
6376,NOVEMBER,Of cloud or ether; and their whirling fires
6377,NOVEMBER,Threw off the air in halo where they roll'd:
6378,NOVEMBER,And either nave that round the axle turn'd
6379,NOVEMBER,"A ruby was, whose steady crimson burn'd"
6380,NOVEMBER,Betwixt the twin speed-mingling fans of gold.
6381,NOVEMBER,
6382,NOVEMBER,
6383,NOVEMBER,7
6384,NOVEMBER,
6385,NOVEMBER,"Thereon the naked goddess mounting, shook"
6386,NOVEMBER,"The reins; whereat the doves their wings outspread,"
6387,NOVEMBER,And rising high their flight to heaven they took:
6388,NOVEMBER,"And all the birds, that in those courts were bred,"
6389,NOVEMBER,"Of her broad eaves the nested families,"
6390,NOVEMBER,"Sparrows and swallows, join'd their companies"
6391,NOVEMBER,Awhile and twitter'd to her overhead.
6392,NOVEMBER,
6393,NOVEMBER,
6394,NOVEMBER,8
6395,NOVEMBER,
6396,NOVEMBER,But onward she with fading tracks of flame
6397,NOVEMBER,"Sped swiftly, till she reacht her journey's end:"
6398,NOVEMBER,"And when within the house of Zeus she came,"
6399,NOVEMBER,She pray'd the Sire of Heaven that he would lend
6400,NOVEMBER,"Hermes, the Argus-slayer, for her hest;"
6401,NOVEMBER,"And he being granted her at her request,"
6402,NOVEMBER,She went forthwith to seek him and to send.
6403,NOVEMBER,
6404,NOVEMBER,
6405,NOVEMBER,9
6406,NOVEMBER,
6407,NOVEMBER,Who happ'd within the palace then to wait
6408,NOVEMBER,Upon the almighty pleasure; and her tale
6409,NOVEMBER,"Was quickly told, and he made answer straight"
6410,NOVEMBER,That he would find the truant without fail;
6411,NOVEMBER,Asking the goddess by what signs her slave
6412,NOVEMBER,"Might best be known, and what the price she gave"
6413,NOVEMBER,"For capture, or admitted for the bail."
6414,NOVEMBER,
6415,NOVEMBER,
6416,NOVEMBER,10
6417,NOVEMBER,
6418,NOVEMBER,All which he took his silver stile to write
6419,NOVEMBER,In letters large upon a waxed board;
6420,NOVEMBER,"Her age and name, her colour, face and height,"
6421,NOVEMBER,"Her home, and parentage, and the reward:"
6422,NOVEMBER,And then read o'er as 'twas to be proclaim'd.
6423,NOVEMBER,"And she took oath to give the price she named,"
6424,NOVEMBER,"Without demur, when Psyche was restored."
6425,NOVEMBER,
6426,NOVEMBER,
6427,NOVEMBER,11
6428,NOVEMBER,
6429,NOVEMBER,Then on his head he closely set his cap
6430,NOVEMBER,"With earÃ¨d wings erect, and o'er his knee"
6431,NOVEMBER,He cross'd each foot in turn to prove the strap
6432,NOVEMBER,"That bound his wingÃ¨d sandals, and shook free"
6433,NOVEMBER,"His chlamys, and gat up, and in his hand"
6434,NOVEMBER,"Taking his fair white-ribbon'd herald's wand,"
6435,NOVEMBER,"Lept forth on air, accoutred cap-a-pÃ¨."
6436,NOVEMBER,
6437,NOVEMBER,
6438,NOVEMBER,12
6439,NOVEMBER,
6440,NOVEMBER,"And piloting along the mid-day sky,"
6441,NOVEMBER,"Held southward, till the narrow map of Crete"
6442,NOVEMBER,Lay like a fleck in azure 'neath his eye;
6443,NOVEMBER,"When down he came, and as an eagle fleet"
6444,NOVEMBER,"Drops in some combe, then checks his headlong stoop"
6445,NOVEMBER,"With wide-flung wing, wheeling in level swoop"
6446,NOVEMBER,"To strike the bleating quarry with his feet,"
6447,NOVEMBER,
6448,NOVEMBER,
6449,NOVEMBER,13
6450,NOVEMBER,
6451,NOVEMBER,Thus he alighted; and in every town
6452,NOVEMBER,In all the isle before the close of day
6453,NOVEMBER,"Had cried the message, which he carried down,"
6454,NOVEMBER,"Of Psyche, Aphrodite's runaway;"
6455,NOVEMBER,"That whosoever found the same and caught,"

6763,DECEMBER,That I from mortal flesh a plant was made.

6785,DECEMBER,The pasture of the yellow-fleecÃ¨d flocks:
6786,DECEMBER,"Or if thou coud, their herded horns would gore"

6818,DECEMBER,Out of the hills; and lo! one golden beast
6819,DECEMBER,Caught in a thornbush; and the mighty brute
6820,DECEMBER,Struggl'd and tore it from its twisted root

6822,DECEMBER,
6823,DECEMBER,
6824,DECEMBER,16
6825,DECEMBER,

6829,DECEMBER,And back to heaven for passage swift gan pray.
6830,DECEMBER,"And Hermes, who was sent to be her guide"

6855,DECEMBER,
6856,DECEMBER,
6857,DECEMBER,19
6858,DECEMBER,
6859,DECEMBER,Far off a gloomy mountain rose alone:
6860,DECEMBER,"And Aphrodite, thither pointing, said"
6861,DECEMBER,'There lies thy task. Out of the topmost stone
6862,DECEMBER,Of yonder hill upwells a fountain head.
6863,DECEMBER,Take thou this goblet; brimming must thou bring
6864,DECEMBER,"Its cup with water from that sacred spring,"
6865,DECEMBER,If ever to my son thou wouldst be wed.'
6866,DECEMBER,
6867,DECEMBER,
6868,DECEMBER,20
6869,DECEMBER,
6870,DECEMBER,"Saying, she gave into her hands a bowl"
6871,DECEMBER,"Cut of one crystal, open, broad and fair;"
6872,DECEMBER,"And bade her at all hazard keep it whole,"
6873,DECEMBER,For heaven held nought beside so fine or rare.
6874,DECEMBER,Then was she gone; and Psyche on the plain
6875,DECEMBER,Now doubted if she ever should regain
6876,DECEMBER,"The love of Eros, strove she howsoe'er."
6877,DECEMBER,
6878,DECEMBER,
6879,DECEMBER,21
6880,DECEMBER,
6881,DECEMBER,"Yet as a helmsman, at the word to tack,"
6882,DECEMBER,"Swiftly without a thought puts down his helm,"
6883,DECEMBER,"So Psyche turn'd to tread that desert black,"
6884,DECEMBER,Since was no fear that coud her heart o'erwhelm;
6885,DECEMBER,Nor knew she that she went the fount to seek
6886,DECEMBER,"Of cold Cocytus, springing to the peak,"
6887,DECEMBER,Secretly from his source in Pluto's realm.
6888,DECEMBER,
6889,DECEMBER,
6890,DECEMBER,22
6891,DECEMBER,
6892,DECEMBER,"All night and day she journey'd, and at last"
6893,DECEMBER,Come to the rock gazed up in vain around:
6894,DECEMBER,Nothing she saw but precipices vast
6895,DECEMBER,"O'er ruined scarps, with rugged ridges crown'd:"
6896,DECEMBER,"And creeping to a cleft to rest in shade,"
6897,DECEMBER,"Or e'er the desperate venture she assay'd,"
6898,DECEMBER,She fell asleep upon the stony ground.
6899,DECEMBER,
6900,DECEMBER,
6901,DECEMBER,23
6902,DECEMBER,
6903,DECEMBER,"A dream came to her, thus: she stood alone"
6904,DECEMBER,Within her palace in the high ravine;
6905,DECEMBER,"Where nought but she was changed, but she to stone."
6906,DECEMBER,"Worshippers throng'd the court, and still were seen"
6907,DECEMBER,"Folk flying from the peak, who, ever more"
6908,DECEMBER,"Flying and flying, lighted on the floor,"
6909,DECEMBER,"_Hail!_ cried they, _wife of Eros, adorÃ¨d queen_!"
6910,DECEMBER,
6911,DECEMBER,
6912,DECEMBER,24
6913,DECEMBER,
6914,DECEMBER,A hurtling of the battl'd air disturb'd
6915,DECEMBER,"Her sunken sense, and waked her eyes to meet"
6916,DECEMBER,"The kingly bird of Zeus, himself that curb'd"
6917,DECEMBER,"His swooping course, alighting at her feet;"
6918,DECEMBER,"With motion gentle, his far-darting eye"
6919,DECEMBER,"In kindness dim'd upon her, he drew nigh,"
6920,DECEMBER,And thus in words unveil'd her foe's deceit:
6921,DECEMBER,
6922,DECEMBER,
6923,DECEMBER,25
6924,DECEMBER,
6925,DECEMBER,"'In vain, poor Psyche, hast thou hither striven"
6926,DECEMBER,Across the fiery plain toiling so well;
6927,DECEMBER,Cruelly to destruction art thou driven
6928,DECEMBER,"By her, whose hate thou canst not quit nor quell."
6929,DECEMBER,"No mortal foot may scale this horrid mount,"
6930,DECEMBER,And those black waters of its topmost fount
6931,DECEMBER,Are guarded by the hornÃ¨d snakes of hell.
6932,DECEMBER,
6933,DECEMBER,
6934,DECEMBER,26
6935,DECEMBER,
6936,DECEMBER,'Its little rill is an upleaping jet
6937,DECEMBER,"Of cold Cocytus, which for ever licks"
6938,DECEMBER,"Earth's base, and when with Acheron 'tis met,"
6939,DECEMBER,"Its waters with that other cannot mix,"
6940,DECEMBER,Which holds the elemental air dissolved;
6941,DECEMBER,But with it in its ceaseless course revolved
6942,DECEMBER,Issues unmingl'd in the lake of Styx.

6950,DECEMBER,Of them they murder'd on the earth of old:
6951,DECEMBER,"Whom each five years they see, whene'er they make"
6952,DECEMBER,"Their passage to the Acherusian lake,"
6953,DECEMBER,And there release may win from pains condoled.

6957,DECEMBER,

6961,DECEMBER,"But, for the most, again they forward fare"
6962,DECEMBER,"To Tartarus obscene, and outcast thence"

6984,DECEMBER,"The minister of Zeus, that bore his cup,"
6985,DECEMBER,"To fill it with their trusted water up,"
6986,DECEMBER,Thence to the King of heaven therewith to fly.

6994,DECEMBER,"Nor ever made his steady flight to slack,"
6995,DECEMBER,"Ere that he set her down beside her goal,"

7003,JANUARY,1
7004,JANUARY,
7005,JANUARY,"But Eros now recover'd from his hurt,"
7006,JANUARY,Felt other pangs; for who would not relent
7007,JANUARY,Weighing the small crime and unmatch'd desert
7008,JANUARY,Of Psyche with her cruel punishment?
7009,JANUARY,And shamed he grew to be so near allied
7010,JANUARY,"To her, who by her taunts awoke his pride,"
7011,JANUARY,As his compassion by her spite unspent.
7012,JANUARY,
7013,JANUARY,
7014,JANUARY,2
7015,JANUARY,
7016,JANUARY,"Which Aphrodite seeing, wax'd more firm"
7017,JANUARY,That he should never meet with Psyche more;
7018,JANUARY,And had in thought already set the term
7019,JANUARY,"To their communion with that trial sore,"
7020,JANUARY,"Which sent her forth upon a quest accurst,"
7021,JANUARY,"And not to be accomplisht, that of thirst"

7023,JANUARY,
7024,JANUARY,
7025,JANUARY,3
7026,JANUARY,
7027,JANUARY,And now it chanced that she had called her son
7028,JANUARY,"Into her presence-chamber, to unfold"
7029,JANUARY,"Psyche's destruction, that her fate might stun"
7030,JANUARY,What love remained by duty uncontrol'd;
7031,JANUARY,And he to hide his tears' rebellious storm
7032,JANUARY,Was fled; when in his place another form
7033,JANUARY,Rose 'neath the golden lintel; and behold
7034,JANUARY,
7035,JANUARY,
7036,JANUARY,4
7037,JANUARY,
7038,JANUARY,"Psyche herself, in slow and balanced strain,"
7039,JANUARY,"Poising the crystal bowl with fearful heed,"
7040,JANUARY,"Her eyes at watch upon the steadied plane,"
7041,JANUARY,And whole soul gather'd in the single deed.
7042,JANUARY,"Onward she came, and stooping to the floor"
7043,JANUARY,Set down the cup unspill'd and brimming o'er
7044,JANUARY,"At Aphrodite's feet, and rose up freed."
7045,JANUARY,
7046,JANUARY,
7047,JANUARY,5
7048,JANUARY,
7049,JANUARY,"Surprise o'ercame the goddess, and she too"
7050,JANUARY,"Stood like a statue, but with passion pale:"
7051,JANUARY,"Till, when her victim nothing spake, she threw"
7052,JANUARY,"Some kindness in her voice, and bade her hail;"
7053,JANUARY,But in the smiling judge 'twas plain to see--
7054,JANUARY,Saying 'What water bringst thou here to me?'--
7055,JANUARY,That justice over hate should not prevail.
7056,JANUARY,
7057,JANUARY,
7058,JANUARY,6
7059,JANUARY,
7060,JANUARY,Then Psyche said 'This is the biting flood

7062,JANUARY,"Of souls, that guilty of another's blood"
7063,JANUARY,"Are pent therein, and as they swim they scream."
7064,JANUARY,"The hornÃ¨d snakes of hell, upon the mount"

7074,JANUARY,Nor thou the nearer to my promise brought.

7085,JANUARY,If thou wouldst only work as well as want?
7086,JANUARY,"See, now I will not yet be all denial,"
7087,JANUARY,But offer thee one last determining trial;

7090,JANUARY,
7091,JANUARY,9
7092,JANUARY,
7093,JANUARY,"'This box,' and in her hands she took a pyx"
7094,JANUARY,"Square-cut, of dark obsidian's rarest green,"
7095,JANUARY,'Take; and therewith beyond Tartarean Styx
7096,JANUARY,"Go thou, and entering Hades' house obscene,"
7097,JANUARY,"Say to PersephonÃ¨, _If 'tis thy will"
7098,JANUARY,"To shew me so much favour, prithee fill"
7099,JANUARY,This little vase with beauty for Love's queen_.
7100,JANUARY,
7101,JANUARY,
7102,JANUARY,10
7103,JANUARY,
7104,JANUARY,'_She begs but what shall well o'erlast a day;
7105,JANUARY,For of her own was much of late outspent

7107,JANUARY,"Wounded by me, who for the gift am sent._"
7108,JANUARY,"Then bring me what she gives, and with all speed;"
7109,JANUARY,"For truth to say I stand, thou seest, in need"
7110,JANUARY,Of some such charm in my disparagement.

7114,JANUARY,
7115,JANUARY,"'If thou return to me with that acquist,"

7117,JANUARY,"That day to give thee whatsoe'er thou list,"
7118,JANUARY,"An be it my son. Now, Psyche, wilt thou dare?'"
7119,JANUARY,"And Psyche said 'If this thou truly mean,"
7120,JANUARY,"I will go down to Tartarus obscene,"
7121,JANUARY,And beg of Hades' queen thy beauty there.
7122,JANUARY,
7123,JANUARY,
7124,JANUARY,12
7125,JANUARY,
7126,JANUARY,"'Show me the way.' But Aphrodite said,"
7127,JANUARY,'That may'st thou find. Yet I will place thee whence
7128,JANUARY,A way there is: mortals have on it sped;
7129,JANUARY,"Ay, and return'd thereby: so let us hence.'"
7130,JANUARY,"Then swift to earth her willing prey she bore,"
7131,JANUARY,"And left her on the wide Laconian shore,"
7132,JANUARY,"Alone, at midnight, in the darkness dense."
7133,JANUARY,
7134,JANUARY,
7135,JANUARY,13
7136,JANUARY,
7137,JANUARY,'Twas winter; and as shivering Psyche sat
7138,JANUARY,"Waiting for morn, she question'd in her mind"
7139,JANUARY,"What place the goddess meant, arrived whereat"
7140,JANUARY,"She might descend to hell, or how should find"
7141,JANUARY,The way which Gods to living men deny.
7142,JANUARY,"'No Orpheus, nay, nor Hercules am I,'"
7143,JANUARY,"Said she, 'to loosen where the great Gods bind.'"
7144,JANUARY,
7145,JANUARY,
7146,JANUARY,14
7147,JANUARY,
7148,JANUARY,And when at length the long-delaying dawn
7149,JANUARY,"Broke on the peaks of huge TaÃ¿getus,"
7150,JANUARY,And Psyche through the skirts of dark withdrawn
7151,JANUARY,"Look'd on that promontory mountainous,"
7152,JANUARY,"And saw high-crested Taleton in snow,"
7153,JANUARY,"Her heart sank, and she wept with head bent low"
7154,JANUARY,The malice of her foe dispiteous.
7155,JANUARY,
7156,JANUARY,
7157,JANUARY,15
7158,JANUARY,
7159,JANUARY,"And seeing near at hand an ancient tower,"
7160,JANUARY,"Deserted now, but once a hold of men,"
7161,JANUARY,"She came thereto, and, though 'twas all her power,"
7162,JANUARY,Mounted its steep unbroken stair again.
7163,JANUARY,"'Surely,' she said, for now a second time"
7164,JANUARY,She thought to die--'this little height I climb
7165,JANUARY,Will prove my shortest road to Pluto's den.
7166,JANUARY,
7167,JANUARY,
7168,JANUARY,16
7169,JANUARY,
7170,JANUARY,'Hence must I come to Tartarus; once there
7171,JANUARY,"Turn as I may,' and straight to death had sprung;"
7172,JANUARY,When in the mossy tower the imprison'd air
7173,JANUARY,"Was shaken, and the hoary stones gave tongue,"
7174,JANUARY,'Stand firm! Stand firm!' that rugged voice outcried;
7175,JANUARY,'Of such as choose despondency for guide

7181,JANUARY,'Hearken; for I the road and means can teach
7182,JANUARY,How thou may'st come to hell and yet escape.
7183,JANUARY,"And first must thou, that upper gate to reach,"
7184,JANUARY,"Along these seagirt hills thy journey shape,"
7185,JANUARY,To where the land in sea dips furthest South
7186,JANUARY,"At TÃ¦narus and Hades' earthly mouth,"
7187,JANUARY,Hard by Poseidon's temple at the cape.

7306,JANUARY,"Gave Cerberus his cake, Charon his fare,"
7307,JANUARY,And saw through Hell's mouth to the purple air

7335,JANUARY,She saw within nothing: But o'er her sight
7336,JANUARY,That looked on nothing gan a darkness creep.
7337,JANUARY,"A cloudy poison, mix'd of Stygian night,"
7338,JANUARY,Rapt her to deadly and infernal sleep.
7339,JANUARY,"Backward she fell, like one when all is o'er,"
7340,JANUARY,"And lay outstretch'd, as lies upon the shore"
7341,JANUARY,A drown'd corpse cast up by the murmuring deep.

7348,FEBRUARY,
7349,FEBRUARY,"While Eros in his chamber hid his tears,"
7350,FEBRUARY,"Mourning the loss of Psyche and her fate,"
7351,FEBRUARY,The rumour of her safety reacht his ears
7352,FEBRUARY,And how she came to Aphrodite's gate:
7353,FEBRUARY,"Whereat with hope return'd his hardihood,"
7354,FEBRUARY,And secretly he purposed while he coud
7355,FEBRUARY,Himself to save her from the goddess' hate.
7356,FEBRUARY,
7357,FEBRUARY,2
7358,FEBRUARY,
7359,FEBRUARY,"Then learning what he might and guessing more,"
7360,FEBRUARY,His ready wit came soon to understand
7361,FEBRUARY,The journey to the far Laconian shore;
7362,FEBRUARY,Whither to fly and seek his love he plan'd:
7363,FEBRUARY,"And making good escape in dark of night,"
7364,FEBRUARY,Ere the sun crost his true meridian flight
7365,FEBRUARY,He by TeuthronÃ¨ struck the southern strand.
7366,FEBRUARY,
7367,FEBRUARY,
7368,FEBRUARY,3
7369,FEBRUARY,
7370,FEBRUARY,There as it chanct he found that snowy bird
7371,FEBRUARY,"Of Crete, that late made mischief with his queen,"
7372,FEBRUARY,And now along the cliffs with wings unstir'd
7373,FEBRUARY,"Sail'd, and that morn had cross'd the sea between:"
7374,FEBRUARY,"Whom as he past he hail'd, and question'd thus,"
7375,FEBRUARY,"'O snowy gull, if thou from TÃ¦narus"
7376,FEBRUARY,"Be come, say, hast thou there my Psyche seen?'"
7377,FEBRUARY,
7378,FEBRUARY,
7379,FEBRUARY,4
7380,FEBRUARY,
7381,FEBRUARY,The gull replied 'Thy Psyche have I seen;
7382,FEBRUARY,Walking beside the sea she joy'th to bear
7383,FEBRUARY,"A pyx of dark obsidian's rarest green,"
7384,FEBRUARY,Wherein she gazeth on her features fair.
7385,FEBRUARY,She is not hence by now six miles at most.'
7386,FEBRUARY,"Then Eros bade him speed, and down the coast"
7387,FEBRUARY,Held on his passage through the buoyant air.
7388,FEBRUARY,
7389,FEBRUARY,
7390,FEBRUARY,5
7391,FEBRUARY,
7392,FEBRUARY,"With eager eye he search'd the salty marge,"
7393,FEBRUARY,Boding all mischief from his mother's glee;
7394,FEBRUARY,"And wondering of her wiles, and what the charge"
7395,FEBRUARY,Shut in the dark obsidian pyx might be.
7396,FEBRUARY,"And lo! at last, outstretch'd beside the rocks,"
7397,FEBRUARY,Psyche as lifeless; and the open box
7398,FEBRUARY,Laid with the weedy refuse of the sea.
7399,FEBRUARY,
7400,FEBRUARY,
7401,FEBRUARY,6
7402,FEBRUARY,
7403,FEBRUARY,"He guess'd all, flew down, and beside her knelt,"
7404,FEBRUARY,With both his hands stroking her temples wan;
7405,FEBRUARY,"And for the poison with his fingers felt,"
7406,FEBRUARY,And drew it gently from her; and anon
7407,FEBRUARY,She slowly from those Stygian fumes was freed;
7408,FEBRUARY,Which he with magic handling and good heed
7409,FEBRUARY,"Replaced in pyx, and shut the lid thereon."
7410,FEBRUARY,
7411,FEBRUARY,
7412,FEBRUARY,7
7413,FEBRUARY,
7414,FEBRUARY,"'O Psyche,' thus, and kissing her he cried,"
7415,FEBRUARY,"'O simple-hearted Psyche, once again"
7416,FEBRUARY,"Hast thou thy foolish longing gratified,"
7417,FEBRUARY,A second time hath prying been thy bane.
7418,FEBRUARY,"But lo! I, love, am come, for I am thine:"
7419,FEBRUARY,"Nor ever more shall any fate malign,"
7420,FEBRUARY,Or spite of goddess smite our love in twain.
7421,FEBRUARY,
7422,FEBRUARY,
7423,FEBRUARY,8
7424,FEBRUARY,
7425,FEBRUARY,'Let now that I have saved thee twice outweigh
7426,FEBRUARY,The once that I deserted thee: and thou
7427,FEBRUARY,"Hast much obey'd for once to disobey,"
7428,FEBRUARY,And wilt no more my bidding disallow.
7429,FEBRUARY,"Take up thy pyx; to Aphrodite go,"
7430,FEBRUARY,And claim the promise of thy mighty foe;
7431,FEBRUARY,Maybe that she will grant it to thee now.
7432,FEBRUARY,
7433,FEBRUARY,
7434,FEBRUARY,9
7435,FEBRUARY,
7436,FEBRUARY,"'If she should yet refuse, despair not yet!'"
7437,FEBRUARY,"Then Psyche, when she felt his arms restore"
7438,FEBRUARY,"Their old embrace, and as their bodies met,"
7439,FEBRUARY,Knew the great joy that grief is pardon'd for;
7440,FEBRUARY,"And how it doth first ecstasy excel,"
7441,FEBRUARY,"When love well-known, long-lost, and mournÃ¨d well"
7442,FEBRUARY,"In long days of no hope, comes home once more."
7443,FEBRUARY,
7444,FEBRUARY,
7445,FEBRUARY,10
7446,FEBRUARY,
7447,FEBRUARY,But Eros leaping up with purpose keen
7448,FEBRUARY,"Into the air, as only love can fly,"
7449,FEBRUARY,"Bore her to heaven, and setting her unseen"
7450,FEBRUARY,"At Aphrodite's golden gate,--whereby"
7451,FEBRUARY,"They came as night was close on twilight dim,--"
7452,FEBRUARY,"There left, and bidding her say nought of him"
7453,FEBRUARY,Went onward to the house of Zeus most high.
7454,FEBRUARY,
7455,FEBRUARY,
7456,FEBRUARY,11
7457,FEBRUARY,
7458,FEBRUARY,"Where winning audience of the heavenly sire,"
7459,FEBRUARY,"Who well disposed to him was used to be,"
7460,FEBRUARY,He told the story of his strong desire;
7461,FEBRUARY,And boldly begg'd that Zeus would grant his plea
7462,FEBRUARY,"That he might have sweet Psyche for his wife,"
7463,FEBRUARY,"And she be dower'd with immortal life,"
7464,FEBRUARY,"Since she was worthy, by his firm decree."
7465,FEBRUARY,
7466,FEBRUARY,
7467,FEBRUARY,12
7468,FEBRUARY,
7469,FEBRUARY,And great Zeus smiled; and at the smile of Zeus
7470,FEBRUARY,"All heaven was glad, and on the earth below"
7471,FEBRUARY,Was calm and peace awhile and sorrow's truce:
7472,FEBRUARY,"The sun shone forth and smote the winter snow,"
7473,FEBRUARY,"The flowÃ«rs sprang, the birds gan sing and pair,"
7474,FEBRUARY,"And mortals, as they drew the brighten'd air,"
7475,FEBRUARY,"Marvel'd, and quite forgot their common woe."
7476,FEBRUARY,
7477,FEBRUARY,
7478,FEBRUARY,13
7479,FEBRUARY,
7480,FEBRUARY,Yet gave the Thunderer not his full consent
7481,FEBRUARY,"Without some words: 'At length is come the day,'"
7482,FEBRUARY,"Thus spake he, 'when for all thy youth misspent,"
7483,FEBRUARY,Thy mischief-making and thy wanton play
7484,FEBRUARY,Thou art upgrown to taste the sweet and sour:
7485,FEBRUARY,Good shall it work upon thee: from this hour
7486,FEBRUARY,"Look we for better things. And this I say,"
7487,FEBRUARY,
7488,FEBRUARY,
7489,FEBRUARY,14
7490,FEBRUARY,
7491,FEBRUARY,"'That since thy birth, which all we took for bliss,"
7492,FEBRUARY,Thou hast but mock'd us; and no less on me
7493,FEBRUARY,"Hast brought disfavour and contempt, ywiss,"
7494,FEBRUARY,Than others that have had to do with thee:
7495,FEBRUARY,Till only such as vow'd themselves aloof
7496,FEBRUARY,From thee and thine were held in good approof;
7497,FEBRUARY,"And few there were, who thus of shame went free."
7498,FEBRUARY,
7499,FEBRUARY,
7500,FEBRUARY,15
7501,FEBRUARY,
7502,FEBRUARY,'That punishment is shapen as reward
7503,FEBRUARY,Is like thy fortune: but our good estate
7504,FEBRUARY,"We honour, while we sit to be adored:"
7505,FEBRUARY,And thus 'twas written in the book of Fate.
7506,FEBRUARY,"Not for thy pleasure, but the general weal"
7507,FEBRUARY,Grant I the grace for which thou here dost kneel;
7508,FEBRUARY,And that which I determine shall not wait.'
7509,FEBRUARY,
7510,FEBRUARY,
7511,FEBRUARY,16
7512,FEBRUARY,
7513,FEBRUARY,"So wingÃ¨d Hermes through the heaven he sped,"
7514,FEBRUARY,"To warn the high celestials to his hall,"
7515,FEBRUARY,"Where they should Psyche see with Eros wed,"
7516,FEBRUARY,And keep the day with feast ambrosial.
7517,FEBRUARY,"And Hermes, flying through the skiey ways"
7518,FEBRUARY,"Of high Olympus, spread sweet Psyche's praise,"
7519,FEBRUARY,And bade the mighty gods obey his call.
7520,FEBRUARY,
7521,FEBRUARY,
7522,FEBRUARY,17
7523,FEBRUARY,
7524,FEBRUARY,Then all the Kronian gods and goddesses
7525,FEBRUARY,"Assembl'd at his cry,--and now 'twas known"
7526,FEBRUARY,"Why Zeus had smiled,--the lesser majesties"
7527,FEBRUARY,Attending them before his royal throne.
7528,FEBRUARY,"Athena, mistress good of them that know,"
7529,FEBRUARY,"Came, and Apollo, warder off of woe,"
7530,FEBRUARY,Who had to Psyche's sire her fate foreshown;
7531,FEBRUARY,
7532,FEBRUARY,
7533,FEBRUARY,18
7534,FEBRUARY,
7535,FEBRUARY,"Demeter, giver of the golden corn,"
7536,FEBRUARY,"Fair Hebe, honour'd at her Attic shrine,"
7537,FEBRUARY,"And Artemis with hunting spear and horn,"
7538,FEBRUARY,"And Dionysos, planter of the vine,"
7539,FEBRUARY,"With old Poseidon from the barren sea,"
7540,FEBRUARY,"And Leto, and the lame HephÃ¦stos, he"
7541,FEBRUARY,Himself who built those halls with skill divine.
7542,FEBRUARY,
7543,FEBRUARY,
7544,FEBRUARY,19
7545,FEBRUARY,
7546,FEBRUARY,And ruddy Pan with many a quip and quirk
7547,FEBRUARY,"Air'd 'mong those lofty gods his mirth illbred,"
7548,FEBRUARY,Bearing a mighty bowl of cretan work:
7549,FEBRUARY,"Stern ArÃªs, with his crisp hair helmeted,"
7550,FEBRUARY,"Came, and retirÃ¨d Hestia, and the god"
7551,FEBRUARY,"Hermes, with wingÃ¨d cap and ribbon'd rod,"
7552,FEBRUARY,By whom the company was heralded.
7553,FEBRUARY,
7554,FEBRUARY,
7555,FEBRUARY,20
7556,FEBRUARY,
7557,FEBRUARY,"And Hera sat by Zeus, and all around"
7558,FEBRUARY,"The Muses, that of learning make their choice;"
7559,FEBRUARY,"Who, when Apollo struck his strings to sound,"
7560,FEBRUARY,Sang in alternate music with sweet voice:
7561,FEBRUARY,"And righteous Themis, and the Graces three"
7562,FEBRUARY,Ushering the anger'd Aphrodite; she
7563,FEBRUARY,Alone of all were there might not rejoice
7564,FEBRUARY,
7565,FEBRUARY,
7566,FEBRUARY,21
7567,FEBRUARY,
7568,FEBRUARY,"But ere they sat to feast, Zeus bade them fill"
7569,FEBRUARY,"The cup ambrosial of immortal life,"
7570,FEBRUARY,"And said 'If Psyche drink,--and 'tis my will,--"
7571,FEBRUARY,There is an end of this unhappy strife.
7572,FEBRUARY,"Nor can the goddess, whose mislike had birth"
7573,FEBRUARY,"From too great honour paid the bride on earth,"
7574,FEBRUARY,Forbid her any more for Eros' wife.'
7575,FEBRUARY,
7576,FEBRUARY,
7577,FEBRUARY,22
7578,FEBRUARY,
7579,FEBRUARY,Then Aphrodite said 'So let it be.'
7580,FEBRUARY,"And Psyche was brought in, with such a flush"
7581,FEBRUARY,"Of joy upon her face, as there to see"
7582,FEBRUARY,Was fairer to love's eye than beauty's blush.
7583,FEBRUARY,"And then she drank the eternal wine, whose draught"
7584,FEBRUARY,"Can Terror cease: which flesh hath never quafft,"
7585,FEBRUARY,Nor doth it flow from grape that mortals crush.
7586,FEBRUARY,
7587,FEBRUARY,
7588,FEBRUARY,23
7589,FEBRUARY,
7590,FEBRUARY,"And next stood Eros forth, and took her hand,"
7591,FEBRUARY,And kisst her happy face before them all:
7592,FEBRUARY,"And Zeus proclaim'd them married, and outban'd"
7593,FEBRUARY,From heaven whoever should that word miscall.
7594,FEBRUARY,"And then all sat to feast, and one by one"
7595,FEBRUARY,Pledged Psyche ere they drank and cried _Well done!_
7596,FEBRUARY,And merry laughter rang throughout the hall.
7597,FEBRUARY,
7598,FEBRUARY,
7599,FEBRUARY,24
7600,FEBRUARY,
7601,FEBRUARY,"So thus was Eros unto Psyche wed,"
7602,FEBRUARY,"The heavenly bridegroom to his earthly bride,"
7603,FEBRUARY,"Who won his love, in simple maidenhead:"
7604,FEBRUARY,"And by her love herself she glorified,"
7605,FEBRUARY,And him from wanton wildness disinclined;
7606,FEBRUARY,Since in his love for her he came to find
7607,FEBRUARY,A joy unknown through all Olympus wide.
7608,FEBRUARY,
7609,FEBRUARY,
7610,FEBRUARY,25
7611,FEBRUARY,
7612,FEBRUARY,"And Psyche for her fall was quite forgiven,"
7613,FEBRUARY,"Since 'gainst herself when tempted to rebel,"
7614,FEBRUARY,"By others' malice on her ruin driven,"
7615,FEBRUARY,Only of sweet simplicity she fell:--
7616,FEBRUARY,Wherein who fall may fall unto the skies;--
7617,FEBRUARY,"And being foolish she was yet most wise,"
7618,FEBRUARY,And took her trials patiently and well.
7619,FEBRUARY,
7620,FEBRUARY,
7621,FEBRUARY,26
7622,FEBRUARY,
7623,FEBRUARY,And Aphrodite since her full defeat
7624,FEBRUARY,"Is kinder and less jealous than before,"
7625,FEBRUARY,"And smiling on them both, calls Psyche sweet;"
7626,FEBRUARY,But thinks her son less manly than of yore:
7627,FEBRUARY,"Though still she holds his arm of some renown,"
7628,FEBRUARY,"When he goes smiting mortals up and down,"
7629,FEBRUARY,Piercing their marrow with his weapons sore.
7630,FEBRUARY,
7631,FEBRUARY,
7632,FEBRUARY,27
7633,FEBRUARY,
7634,FEBRUARY,_So now in steadfast love and happy state_
7635,FEBRUARY,"They hold for aye their mansion in the sky,"
7636,FEBRUARY,"And send down heavenly peace on those who mate,"
7637,FEBRUARY,"In virgin love, to find their joy thereby:"
7638,FEBRUARY,"Whom gently Eros shooteth, and apart"
7639,FEBRUARY,Keepeth for them from all his sheaf that dart
7640,FEBRUARY,Which Psyche in his chamber pickt to try.
7641,FEBRUARY,
7642,FEBRUARY,
7643,FEBRUARY,28
7644,FEBRUARY,
7645,FEBRUARY,"Now in that same month Psyche bare a child,"
7646,FEBRUARY,Who straight in heaven was named HedonÃ¨
7647,FEBRUARY,In mortal tongues by other letters styled;
7648,FEBRUARY,"Whom all to love, however named, agree:"
7649,FEBRUARY,"Whom in our noble English JOY we call,"
7650,FEBRUARY,"And honour them among us most of all,"
7651,FEBRUARY,Whose happy children are as fair as she.

7808,OF LOVE,Whereby the lips in wonder reconcile
7809,OF LOVE,"Passion with peace, and show desire at rest,--"
7810,OF LOVE,"A grace of silence by the Greek unguesst,"
7811,OF LOVE,That bloom'd to immortalize the Tuscan style:
7812,OF LOVE,
7813,OF LOVE,When first the angel-song that faith hath ken'd
7814,OF LOVE,"Fancy pourtray'd, above recorded oath"
7815,OF LOVE,"Of Israel's God, or light of poem pen'd;"
7816,OF LOVE,The very countenance of plighted troth
7817,OF LOVE,"'Twixt heaven and earth, where in one moment blend"
7818,OF LOVE,The hope of one and happiness of both.
7819,OF LOVE,
7820,OF LOVE,
7821,OF LOVE,8
7822,OF LOVE,
7823,OF LOVE,For beauty being the best of all we know
7824,OF LOVE,Sums up the unsearchable and secret aims
7825,OF LOVE,"Of nature, and on joys whose earthly names"
7826,OF LOVE,Were never told can form and sense bestow;
7827,OF LOVE,And man hath sped his instinct to outgo
7828,OF LOVE,The step of science; and against her shames
7829,OF LOVE,"Imagination stakes out heavenly claims,"
7830,OF LOVE,Building a tower above the head of woe.
7831,OF LOVE,
7832,OF LOVE,Nor is there fairer work for beauty found
7833,OF LOVE,Than that she win in nature her release
7834,OF LOVE,From all the woes that in the world abound:
7835,OF LOVE,"Nay with his sorrow may his love increase,"
7836,OF LOVE,"If from man's greater need beauty redound,"
7837,OF LOVE,And claim his tears for homage of his peace.
7838,OF LOVE,
7839,OF LOVE,
7840,OF LOVE,9
7841,OF LOVE,
7842,OF LOVE,"Thus to thy beauty doth my fond heart look,"
7843,OF LOVE,That late dismay'd her faithless faith forbore;
7844,OF LOVE,And wins again her love lost in the lore
7845,OF LOVE,Of schools and script of many a learned book:
7846,OF LOVE,For thou what ruthless death untimely took
7847,OF LOVE,"Shalt now in better brotherhood restore,"
7848,OF LOVE,And save my batter'd ship that far from shore
7849,OF LOVE,High on the dismal deep in tempest shook.
7850,OF LOVE,
7851,OF LOVE,So in despite of sorrow lately learn'd
7852,OF LOVE,"I still hold true to truth since thou art true,"
7853,OF LOVE,Nor wail the woe which thou to joy hast turn'd:
7854,OF LOVE,Nor come the heavenly sun and bathing blue
7855,OF LOVE,To my life's need more splendid and unearn'd
7856,OF LOVE,Than hath thy gift outmatch'd desire and due.
7857,OF LOVE,
7858,OF LOVE,
7859,OF LOVE,10
7860,OF LOVE,
7861,OF LOVE,Winter was not unkind because uncouth;
7862,OF LOVE,"His prison'd time made me a closer guest,"
7863,OF LOVE,"And gave thy graciousness a warmer zest,"
7864,OF LOVE,Biting all else with keen and angry tooth:
7865,OF LOVE,And bravelier the triumphant blood of youth
7866,OF LOVE,"Mantling thy cheek its happy home possest,"
7867,OF LOVE,"And sterner sport by day put strength to test,"
7868,OF LOVE,And custom's feast at night gave tongue to truth.
7869,OF LOVE,
7870,OF LOVE,Or say hath flaunting summer a device
7871,OF LOVE,"To match our midnight revelry, that rang"
7872,OF LOVE,With steel and flame along the snow-girt ice?
7873,OF LOVE,Or when we hark't to nightingales that sang
7874,OF LOVE,"On dewy eves in spring, did they entice"
7875,OF LOVE,To gentler love than winter's icy fang?
7876,OF LOVE,
7877,OF LOVE,
7878,OF LOVE,11
7879,OF LOVE,
7880,OF LOVE,"There's many a would-be poet at this hour,"
7881,OF LOVE,"Rhymes of a love that he hath never woo'd,"
7882,OF LOVE,And o'er his lamplit desk in solitude
7883,OF LOVE,Deems that he sitteth in the Muses' bower:
7884,OF LOVE,"And some the flames of earthly love devour,"
7885,OF LOVE,"Who have taken no kiss of Nature, nor renew'd"
7886,OF LOVE,In the world's wilderness with heavenly food
7887,OF LOVE,The sickly body of their perishing power.
7888,OF LOVE,
7889,OF LOVE,"So none of all our company, I boast,"
7890,OF LOVE,"But now would mock my penning, coud they see"
7891,OF LOVE,How down the right it maps a jagged coast;
7892,OF LOVE,Seeing they hold the manlier praise to be
7893,OF LOVE,"Strong hand and will, and the heart best when most"
7894,OF LOVE,"'Tis sober, simple, true, and fancy-free."
7895,OF LOVE,
7896,OF LOVE,
7897,OF LOVE,12
7898,OF LOVE,
7899,OF LOVE,"How coud I quarrel or blame you, most dear,"
7900,OF LOVE,Who all thy virtues gavest and kept back none;
7901,OF LOVE,"Kindness and gentleness, truth without peer,"
7902,OF LOVE,And beauty that my fancy fed upon?
7903,OF LOVE,Now not my life's contrition for my fault
7904,OF LOVE,"Can blot that day, nor work me recompence,"
7905,OF LOVE,"Tho' I might worthily thy worth exalt,"
7906,OF LOVE,Making thee long amends for short offence.
7907,OF LOVE,
7908,OF LOVE,"For surely nowhere, love, if not in thee"
7909,OF LOVE,Are grace and truth and beauty to be found;
7910,OF LOVE,And all my praise of these can only be
7911,OF LOVE,"A praise of thee, howe'er by thee disown'd:"
7912,OF LOVE,"While still thou must be mine tho' far removed,"
7913,OF LOVE,And I for one offence no more beloved.
7914,OF LOVE,
7915,OF LOVE,
7916,OF LOVE,13
7917,OF LOVE,
7918,OF LOVE,Now since to me altho' by thee refused
7919,OF LOVE,"The world is left, I shall find pleasure still;"
7920,OF LOVE,The art that most I have loved but little used
7921,OF LOVE,Will yield a world of fancies at my will:
7922,OF LOVE,"And tho' where'er thou goest it is from me,"
7923,OF LOVE,I where I go thee in my heart must bear;
7924,OF LOVE,"And what thou wert that wilt thou ever be,"
7925,OF LOVE,"My choice, my best, my loved, and only fair."
7926,OF LOVE,
7927,OF LOVE,"Farewell, yet think not such farewell a change"
7928,OF LOVE,"From tenderness, tho' once to meet or part"
7929,OF LOVE,But on short absence so coud sense derange
7930,OF LOVE,That tears have graced the greeting of my heart;
7931,OF LOVE,"They were proud drops and had my leave to fall,"
7932,OF LOVE,Not on thy pity for my pain to call.
7933,OF LOVE,
7934,OF LOVE,
7935,OF LOVE,14
7936,OF LOVE,
7937,OF LOVE,When sometimes in an ancient house where state
7938,OF LOVE,"From noble ancestry is handed on,"
7939,OF LOVE,"We see but desolation thro' the gate,"
7940,OF LOVE,And richest heirlooms all to ruin gone;
7941,OF LOVE,"Because maybe some fancied shame or fear,"
7942,OF LOVE,"Bred of disease or melancholy fate,"
7943,OF LOVE,Hath driven the owner from his rightful sphere
7944,OF LOVE,To wander nameless save to pity or hate:
7945,OF LOVE,
7946,OF LOVE,"What is the wreck of all he hath in fief,"
7947,OF LOVE,When he that hath is wrecking? nought is fine
7948,OF LOVE,"Unto the sick, nor doth it burden grief"
7949,OF LOVE,That the house perish when the soul doth pine.
7950,OF LOVE,"Thus I my state despise, slain by a sting"
7951,OF LOVE,So slight 'twould not have hurt a meaner thing.
7952,OF LOVE,

7956,OF LOVE,Who builds a ship must first lay down the keel
7957,OF LOVE,"Of health, whereto the ribs of mirth are wed:"
7958,OF LOVE,"And knit, with beams and knees of strength, a bed"
7959,OF LOVE,"For decks of purity, her floor and ceil."
7960,OF LOVE,"Upon her masts, Adventure, Pride, and Zeal,"
7961,OF LOVE,To fortune's wind the sails of purpose spread:
7962,OF LOVE,And at the prow make figured maidenhead
7963,OF LOVE,O'erride the seas and answer to the wheel.
7964,OF LOVE,
7965,OF LOVE,And let him deep in memory's hold have stor'd
7966,OF LOVE,Water of Helicon: and let him fit
7967,OF LOVE,The needle that doth true with heaven accord:
7968,OF LOVE,"Then bid her crew, love, diligence and wit"
7969,OF LOVE,"With justice, courage, temperance come aboard,"
7970,OF LOVE,And at her helm the master reason sit.
7971,OF LOVE,
7972,OF LOVE,
7973,OF LOVE,16
7974,OF LOVE,
7975,OF LOVE,"This world is unto God a work of art,"
7976,OF LOVE,Of which the unaccomplish'd heavenly plan
7977,OF LOVE,"Is hid in life within the creature's heart,"
7978,OF LOVE,And for perfection looketh unto man.
7979,OF LOVE,Ah me! those thousand ages: with what slow
7980,OF LOVE,"Pains and persistence were his idols made,"
7981,OF LOVE,"Destroy'd and made, ere ever he coud know"
7982,OF LOVE,The mighty mother must be so obey'd.
7983,OF LOVE,
7984,OF LOVE,For lack of knowledge and thro' little skill
7985,OF LOVE,His childish mimicry outwent his aim;
7986,OF LOVE,His effort shaped the genius of his will;
7987,OF LOVE,"Till thro' distinction and revolt he came,"
7988,OF LOVE,"True to his simple terms of good and ill,"
7989,OF LOVE,Seeking the face of Beauty without blame.
7990,OF LOVE,
7991,OF LOVE,
7992,OF LOVE,17
7993,OF LOVE,
7994,OF LOVE,"Say who be these light-bearded, sunburnt faces"
7995,OF LOVE,"In negligent and travel-stain'd array,"
7996,OF LOVE,"That in the city of Dante come to-day,"
7997,OF LOVE,Haughtily visiting her holy places?
7998,OF LOVE,"O these be noble men that hide their graces,"
7999,OF LOVE,"True England's blood, her ancient glory's stay,"
8000,OF LOVE,By tales of fame diverted on their way
8001,OF LOVE,Home from the rule of oriental races.
8002,OF LOVE,
8003,OF LOVE,"Life-trifling lions these, of gentle eyes"
8004,OF LOVE,"And motion delicate, but swift to fire"
8005,OF LOVE,"For honour, passionate where duty lies,"
8006,OF LOVE,Most loved and loving: and they quickly tire
8007,OF LOVE,"Of Florence, that she one day more denies"
8008,OF LOVE,"The embrace of wife and son, of sister or sire."

8014,OF LOVE,At forenoon overlooks the city of flowers
8015,OF LOVE,"I sat, and gazing on her domes and towers"
8016,OF LOVE,Call'd up her famous children one by one:
8017,OF LOVE,"And three who all the rest had far outdone,"
8018,OF LOVE,"Mild Giotto first, who stole the morning hours,"
8019,OF LOVE,"I saw, and god-like Buonarroti's powers,"
8020,OF LOVE,"And Dante, gravest poet, her much-wrong'd son."
8021,OF LOVE,
8022,OF LOVE,"Is all this glory, I said, another's praise?"
8023,OF LOVE,"Are these heroic triumphs things of old,"
8024,OF LOVE,And do I dead upon the living gaze?
8025,OF LOVE,"Or rather doth the mind, that can behold"
8026,OF LOVE,"The wondrous beauty of the works and days,"
8027,OF LOVE,Create the image that her thoughts enfold?

8035,OF LOVE,Live on the lips of those that love you well.
8036,OF LOVE,"'Tis ye that conquer'd have the powers of hell,"
8037,OF LOVE,Each with the special grace of your delight:
8038,OF LOVE,"Ye are the world's creators, and thro' might"
8039,OF LOVE,Of everlasting love ye did excel.
8040,OF LOVE,
8041,OF LOVE,"Now ye are starry names, above the storm"
8042,OF LOVE,And war of Time and nature's endless wrong
8043,OF LOVE,"Ye flit, in pictured truth and peaceful form,"
8044,OF LOVE,"Wing'd with bright music and melodious song,--"

8056,OF LOVE,"The most so little, diligently done;"
8057,OF LOVE,"So mighty is the beauty that doth woo,"

8059,OF LOVE,
8060,OF LOVE,"God's love to win is easy, for He loveth"
8061,OF LOVE,"Desire's fair attitude, nor strictly weighs"
8062,OF LOVE,"The broken thing, but all alike approveth"
8063,OF LOVE,Which love hath aim'd at Him: that is heaven's praise:

8065,OF LOVE,'Tis in man's love: all else is nothing worth.
8066,OF LOVE,
8067,OF LOVE,
8068,OF LOVE,21
8069,OF LOVE,
8070,OF LOVE,"O FLESH and blood, comrade to tragic pain"
8071,OF LOVE,And clownish merriment; whose sense could wake
8072,OF LOVE,"Sermons in stones, and count death but an ache,"
8073,OF LOVE,"All things as vanity, yet nothing vain:"
8074,OF LOVE,"The world, set in thy heart, thy passionate strain"
8075,OF LOVE,Reveal'd anew; but thou for man didst make
8076,OF LOVE,"Nature twice natural, only to shake"
8077,OF LOVE,Her kingdom with the creatures of thy brain.
8078,OF LOVE,
8079,OF LOVE,"Lo, Shakespeare, since thy time nature is loth"
8080,OF LOVE,To yield to art her fair supremacy;
8081,OF LOVE,In conquering one thou hast so enrichÃ¨d both.
8082,OF LOVE,What shall I say? for God--whose wise decree
8083,OF LOVE,Confirmeth all He did by all He doth--
8084,OF LOVE,Doubled His whole creation making thee.

8092,OF LOVE,By freezing cliffs the unransom'd wreckage lies:
8093,OF LOVE,"Or, strutting on hot meridian banks, surprise"
8094,OF LOVE,The silence: over plains in the moonlight bare
8095,OF LOVE,"I chase my shadow, and perch where no bird dare"
8096,OF LOVE,In treetops torn by fiercest winds of the skies.
8097,OF LOVE,
8098,OF LOVE,"Poor simple birds, foolish birds! then I cry,"
8099,OF LOVE,"Ye pretty pictures of delight, unstir'd"
8100,OF LOVE,By the only joy of knowing that ye fly;
8101,OF LOVE,"Ye are nÃ³t what ye are, but rather, sum'd in a word,"

8109,OF LOVE,"That turn your eyes to all the peaks that shine,"
8110,OF LOVE,Hailing in each the citadel divine
8111,OF LOVE,The which ye thought to have enter'd long ago;
8112,OF LOVE,Until at length your feeble steps and slow
8113,OF LOVE,"Falter upon the threshold of the shrine,"
8114,OF LOVE,And your hearts overburden'd doubt in fine
8115,OF LOVE,Whether it be Jerusalem or no:
8116,OF LOVE,
8117,OF LOVE,"Dishearten'd pilgrims, I am one of you;"
8118,OF LOVE,"For, having worshipp'd many a barren face,"
8119,OF LOVE,I scarce now greet the goal I journey'd to:
8120,OF LOVE,I stand a pagan in the holy place;
8121,OF LOVE,"Beneath the lamp of truth I am found untrue,"
8122,OF LOVE,And question with the God that I embrace.

8128,OF LOVE,"Her melting air, at every breath we draw,"
8129,OF LOVE,Floods heart with love to praise God's gracious law:
8130,OF LOVE,But suddenly--so short is pleasure's lease--
8131,OF LOVE,"The cold returns, the buds from growing cease,"
8132,OF LOVE,And nature's conquer'd face is full of awe;
8133,OF LOVE,As now the trait'rous north with icy flaw
8134,OF LOVE,"Freezes the dew upon the sick lamb's fleece,"
8135,OF LOVE,
8136,OF LOVE,And 'neath the mock sun searching everywhere
8137,OF LOVE,Rattles the crispÃ¨d leaves with shivering din:
8138,OF LOVE,So that the birds are silent with despair
8139,OF LOVE,Within the thickets; nor their armour thin
8140,OF LOVE,"Will gaudy flies adventure in the air,"
8141,OF LOVE,Nor any lizard sun his spotted skin.

8147,OF LOVE,"No rapture in the first relays of spring,"
8148,OF LOVE,"In songs of birds, in young buds opening,"
8149,OF LOVE,Nothing inspiriting and nothing kind;
8150,OF LOVE,"For lack of thee, who once wert throned behind"
8151,OF LOVE,"All beauty, like a strength where graces cling,--"
8152,OF LOVE,"The jewel and heart of light, which everything"
8153,OF LOVE,Wrestled in rivalry to hold enshrined.
8154,OF LOVE,
8155,OF LOVE,"Ah! since thou'rt fled, and I in each fair sight"
8156,OF LOVE,"The sweet occasion of my joy deplore,"

8168,OF LOVE,"Rests, and affirms there is no more to do."
8169,OF LOVE,"Now the third joy of making, the sweet flower"
8170,OF LOVE,"Of blessed work, bloometh in godlike spirit;"
8171,OF LOVE,Which whoso plucketh holdeth for an hour
8172,OF LOVE,The shrivelling vanity of mortal merit.
8173,OF LOVE,
8174,OF LOVE,"And thou, my perfect work, thou'rt of to-day;"
8175,OF LOVE,"To-morrow a poor and alien thing wilt be,"
8176,OF LOVE,True only should the swift life stand at stay:

8187,OF LOVE,"Before the new and milder days of man,"
8188,OF LOVE,Had never rib nor bray nor swindging fan
8189,OF LOVE,"Like his iron swimmer of the Clyde or Tyne,"
8190,OF LOVE,Late-born of golden seed to breed a line
8191,OF LOVE,Of offspring swifter and more huge of plan.
8192,OF LOVE,
8193,OF LOVE,"Straight is her going, for upon the sun"
8194,OF LOVE,"When once she hath look'd, her path and place are plain;"

8200,OF LOVE,
8201,OF LOVE,28
8202,OF LOVE,
8203,OF LOVE,A thousand times hath in my heart's behoof
8204,OF LOVE,My tongue been set his passion to impart;
8205,OF LOVE,A thousand times hath my too coward heart
8206,OF LOVE,My mouth reclosed and fix'd it to the roof;
8207,OF LOVE,"Then with such cunning hath it held aloof,"
8208,OF LOVE,A thousand times kept silence with such art
8209,OF LOVE,That words coud do no more: yet on thy part
8210,OF LOVE,Hath silence given a thousand times reproof.
8211,OF LOVE,
8212,OF LOVE,"I should be bolder, seeing I commend"
8213,OF LOVE,"Love, that my dilatory purpose primes,"
8214,OF LOVE,But fear lest with my fears my hope should end:

8226,OF LOVE,"I wait upon thy coming, but always--"
8227,OF LOVE,Dancing to meet my thoughts if they invite--
8228,OF LOVE,"Thou hast outrun their longing with delight,"
8229,OF LOVE,And in my solitude dost mock my praise.
8230,OF LOVE,
8231,OF LOVE,Now doth my drop of time transcend the whole:

8233,OF LOVE,No history where loveless Nile doth roll.
8234,OF LOVE,"--This is eternal life, which doth forbid"

8243,OF LOVE,"Wherefore I love her, and I love to tell"
8244,OF LOVE,"My love, as all my loving songs aver."
8245,OF LOVE,"But what on her part could the passion stir,"
8246,OF LOVE,"Tho' 'tis more difficult for love to spell,"
8247,OF LOVE,"Yet can I dare divine how this befel,"
8248,OF LOVE,Nor will her lips deny it if I err.
8249,OF LOVE,
8250,OF LOVE,"She loves me first because I love her, then"
8251,OF LOVE,Loves me for knowing why she should be loved.
8252,OF LOVE,"And that I love to praise her, loves again."
8253,OF LOVE,"So from her beauty both our loves are moved,"
8254,OF LOVE,And by her beauty are sustain'd; nor when
8255,OF LOVE,The earth falls from the sun is this disproved.
8256,OF LOVE,
8257,OF LOVE,
8258,OF LOVE,31
8259,OF LOVE,
8260,OF LOVE,"In all things beautiful, I cannot see"
8261,OF LOVE,"Her sit or stand, but love is stir'd anew:"
8262,OF LOVE,"'Tis joy to watch the folds fall as they do,"
8263,OF LOVE,And all that comes is past expectancy.
8264,OF LOVE,"If she be silent, silence let it be;"
8265,OF LOVE,He who would bid her speak might sit and sue
8266,OF LOVE,The deep-brow'd Phidian Jove to be untrue
8267,OF LOVE,To his two thousand years' solemnity.
8268,OF LOVE,
8269,OF LOVE,"Ah, but her launchÃ¨d passion, when she sings,"
8270,OF LOVE,Wins on the hearing like a shapen prow
8271,OF LOVE,Borne by the mastery of its urgent wings:
8272,OF LOVE,"Or if she deign her wisdom, she doth show"
8273,OF LOVE,"She hath the intelligence of heavenly things,"
8274,OF LOVE,Unsullied by man's mortal overthrow.
8275,OF LOVE,
8276,OF LOVE,
8277,OF LOVE,32
8278,OF LOVE,
8279,OF LOVE,Thus to be humbled: 'tis that ranging pride
8280,OF LOVE,No refuge hath; that in his castle strong
8281,OF LOVE,"Brave reason sits beleaguer'd, who so long"
8282,OF LOVE,"Kept field, but now must starve where he doth hide;"
8283,OF LOVE,"That industry, who once the foe defied,"
8284,OF LOVE,Lies slaughter'd in the trenches; that the throng
8285,OF LOVE,"Of idle fancies pipe their foolish song,"
8286,OF LOVE,Where late the puissant captains fought and died.
8287,OF LOVE,
8288,OF LOVE,Thus to be humbled: 'tis to be undone;
8289,OF LOVE,A forest fell'd; a city razed to ground;
8290,OF LOVE,"A cloak unsewn, unwoven and unspun"
8291,OF LOVE,Till not a thread remains that can be wound.
8292,OF LOVE,"And yet, O lover, thee, the ruin'd one,"
8293,OF LOVE,Love who hath humbled thus hath also crown'd.
8294,OF LOVE,
8295,OF LOVE,
8296,OF LOVE,33
8297,OF LOVE,
8298,OF LOVE,"I care not if I live, tho' life and breath"
8299,OF LOVE,Have never been to me so dear and sweet.
8300,OF LOVE,"I care not if I die, for I coud meet--"
8301,OF LOVE,Being so happy--happily my death.
8302,OF LOVE,I care not if I love; to-day she saith
8303,OF LOVE,"She loveth, and love's history is complete."
8304,OF LOVE,Nor care I if she love me; at her feet
8305,OF LOVE,My spirit bows entranced and worshippeth.
8306,OF LOVE,
8307,OF LOVE,"I have no care for what was most my care,"
8308,OF LOVE,"But all around me see fresh beauty born,"
8309,OF LOVE,And common sights grown lovelier than they were:
8310,OF LOVE,"I dream of love, and in the light of morn"
8311,OF LOVE,"Tremble, beholding all things very fair"
8312,OF LOVE,And strong with strength that puts my strength to scorn.
8313,OF LOVE,
8314,OF LOVE,
8315,OF LOVE,34
8316,OF LOVE,
8317,OF LOVE,_O my goddess divine_ sometimes I say:--
8318,OF LOVE,Now let this word for ever and all suffice;
8319,OF LOVE,"Thou art insatiable, and yet not twice"
8320,OF LOVE,Can even thy lover give his soul away:
8321,OF LOVE,"And for my acts, that at thy feet I lay;"
8322,OF LOVE,"For never any other, by device"
8323,OF LOVE,"Of wisdom, love or beauty, could entice"
8324,OF LOVE,My homage to the measure of this day.
8325,OF LOVE,
8326,OF LOVE,"I have no more to give thee: lo, I have sold"
8327,OF LOVE,"My life, have emptied out my heart, and spent"
8328,OF LOVE,"Whate'er I had; till like a beggar, bold"
8329,OF LOVE,"With nought to lose, I laugh and am content."
8330,OF LOVE,"A beggar kisses thee; nay, love, behold,"
8331,OF LOVE,I fear not: thou too art in beggarment.
8332,OF LOVE,
8333,OF LOVE,
8334,OF LOVE,35
8335,OF LOVE,
8336,OF LOVE,"All earthly beauty hath one cause and proof,"
8337,OF LOVE,To lead the pilgrim soul to beauty above:
8338,OF LOVE,"Yet lieth the greater bliss so far aloof,"
8339,OF LOVE,That few there be are wean'd from earthly love.
8340,OF LOVE,"Joy's ladder it is, reaching from home to home,"
8341,OF LOVE,The best of all the work that all was good;
8342,OF LOVE,"Whereof 'twas writ the angels aye upclomb,"
8343,OF LOVE,"Down sped, and at the top the Lord God stood."
8344,OF LOVE,
8345,OF LOVE,"But I my time abuse, my eyes by day"
8346,OF LOVE,"Center'd on thee, by night my heart on fire--"
8347,OF LOVE,Letting my number'd moments run away--
8348,OF LOVE,Nor e'en 'twixt night and day to heaven aspire:
8349,OF LOVE,So true it is that what the eye seeth not
8350,OF LOVE,"But slow is loved, and loved is soon forgot."
8351,OF LOVE,
8352,OF LOVE,
8353,OF LOVE,36
8354,OF LOVE,
8355,OF LOVE,"O my life's mischief, once my love's delight,"
8356,OF LOVE,"That drew'st a mortgage on my heart's estate,"
8357,OF LOVE,"Whose baneful clause is never out of date,"
8358,OF LOVE,Nor can avenging time restore my right:
8359,OF LOVE,"Whom first to lose sounded that note of spite,"
8360,OF LOVE,Whereto my doleful days were tuned by fate:
8361,OF LOVE,"That art the well-loved cause of all my hate,"
8362,OF LOVE,The sun whose wandering makes my hopeless night:
8363,OF LOVE,
8364,OF LOVE,"Thou being in all my lacking all I lack,"
8365,OF LOVE,"It is thy goodness turns my grace to crime,"
8366,OF LOVE,Thy fleetness from my goal which holds me back;
8367,OF LOVE,"Wherefore my feet go out of step with time,"
8368,OF LOVE,"My very grasp of life is old and slack,"
8369,OF LOVE,And even my passion falters in my rhyme.
8370,OF LOVE,
8371,OF LOVE,
8372,OF LOVE,37
8373,OF LOVE,
8374,OF LOVE,At times with hurried hoofs and scattering dust
8375,OF LOVE,"I race by field or highway, and my horse"
8376,OF LOVE,"Spare not, but urge direct in headlong course"
8377,OF LOVE,Unto some fair far hill that gain I must:
8378,OF LOVE,"But near arrived the vision soon mistrust,"
8379,OF LOVE,"Rein in, and stand as one who sees the source"
8380,OF LOVE,"Of strong illusion, shaming thought to force"
8381,OF LOVE,From off his mind the soil of passion's gust.
8382,OF LOVE,
8383,OF LOVE,"My brow I bare then, and with slacken'd speed"
8384,OF LOVE,"Can view the country pleasant on all sides,"
8385,OF LOVE,And to kind salutation give good heed:
8386,OF LOVE,"I ride as one who for his pleasure rides,"
8387,OF LOVE,"And stroke the neck of my delighted steed,"
8388,OF LOVE,And seek what cheer the village inn provides.
8389,OF LOVE,
8390,OF LOVE,
8391,OF LOVE,38
8392,OF LOVE,
8393,OF LOVE,"An idle June day on the sunny Thames,"
8394,OF LOVE,"Floating or rowing as our fancy led,"
8395,OF LOVE,"Now in the high beams basking as we sped,"
8396,OF LOVE,Now in green shade gliding by mirror'd stems;
8397,OF LOVE,"By lock and weir and isle, and many a spot"
8398,OF LOVE,"Of memoried pleasure, glad with strength and skill,"
8399,OF LOVE,"Friendship, good wine, and mirth, that serve not ill"
8400,OF LOVE,"The heavenly Muse, tho' she requite them not:"
8401,OF LOVE,
8402,OF LOVE,"I would have life--thou saidst--all as this day,"
8403,OF LOVE,"Simple enjoyment calm in its excess,"
8404,OF LOVE,"With not a grief to cloud, and not a ray"
8405,OF LOVE,Of passion overhot my peace to oppress;
8406,OF LOVE,"With no ambition to reproach delay,"
8407,OF LOVE,Nor rapture to disturb its happiness.
8408,OF LOVE,
8409,OF LOVE,
8410,OF LOVE,39
8411,OF LOVE,
8412,OF LOVE,"A man that sees by chance his picture, made"
8413,OF LOVE,"As once a child he was, handling some toy,"
8414,OF LOVE,"Will gaze to find his spirit within the boy,"
8415,OF LOVE,Yet hath no secret with the soul pourtray'd:
8416,OF LOVE,He cannot think the simple thought which play'd
8417,OF LOVE,Upon those features then so frank and coy;
8418,OF LOVE,"'Tis his, yet oh! not his: and o'er the joy"
8419,OF LOVE,His fatherly pity bends in tears dismay'd.
8420,OF LOVE,
8421,OF LOVE,"Proud of his prime maybe he stand at best,"
8422,OF LOVE,"And lightly wear his strength, or aim it high,"
8423,OF LOVE,"In knowledge, skill and courage self-possest:--"
8424,OF LOVE,"Yet in the pictured face a charm doth lie,"
8425,OF LOVE,"The one thing lost more worth than all the rest,"
8426,OF LOVE,"Which seeing, he fears to say _This child was I_."
8427,OF LOVE,
8428,OF LOVE,
8429,OF LOVE,40
8430,OF LOVE,
8431,OF LOVE,"Tears of love, tears of joy and tears of care,"
8432,OF LOVE,"Comforting tears that fell uncomforted,"
8433,OF LOVE,"Tears o'er the new-born, tears beside the dead,"
8434,OF LOVE,"Tears of hope, pride and pity, trust and prayer,"
8435,OF LOVE,Tears of contrition; all tears whatsoe'er
8436,OF LOVE,Of tenderness or kindness had she shed
8437,OF LOVE,"Who here is pictured, ere upon her head"
8438,OF LOVE,The fine gold might be turn'd to silver there.
8439,OF LOVE,
8440,OF LOVE,The smile that charm'd the father hath given place
8441,OF LOVE,Unto the furrow'd care wrought by the son;
8442,OF LOVE,But virtue hath transform'd all change to grace:
8443,OF LOVE,"So that I praise the artist, who hath done"
8444,OF LOVE,"A portrait, for my worship, of the face"
8445,OF LOVE,Won by the heart my father's heart that won.
8446,OF LOVE,
8447,OF LOVE,
8448,OF LOVE,41
8449,OF LOVE,
8450,OF LOVE,If I coud but forget and not recall
8451,OF LOVE,"So well my time of pleasure and of play,"
8452,OF LOVE,"When ancient nature was all new and gay,"
8453,OF LOVE,"Light as the fashion that doth last enthrall,--"
8454,OF LOVE,"Ah mighty nature, when my heart was small,"
8455,OF LOVE,Nor dream'd what fearful searchings underlay
8456,OF LOVE,"The flowers and leafy ecstasy of May,"
8457,OF LOVE,"The breathing summer sloth, the scented fall:"
8458,OF LOVE,
8459,OF LOVE,"Coud I forget, then were the fight not hard,"
8460,OF LOVE,"Press'd in the mÃªlÃ©e of accursed things,"
8461,OF LOVE,Having such help in love and such reward:
8462,OF LOVE,But that 'tis I who once--'tis this that stings--
8463,OF LOVE,"Once dwelt within the gate that angels guard,"
8464,OF LOVE,Where yet I'd be had I but heavenly wings.
8465,OF LOVE,
8466,OF LOVE,
8467,OF LOVE,42
8468,OF LOVE,
8469,OF LOVE,When I see childhood on the threshold seize
8470,OF LOVE,"The prize of life from age and likelihood,"
8471,OF LOVE,"I mourn time's change that will not be withstood,"
8472,OF LOVE,Thinking how Christ said _Be like one of these_.
8473,OF LOVE,For in the forest among many trees
8474,OF LOVE,Scarce one in all is found that hath made good
8475,OF LOVE,"The virgin pattern of its slender wood,"
8476,OF LOVE,That courtesied in joy to every breeze;
8477,OF LOVE,
8478,OF LOVE,"But scath'd, but knotted trunks that raise on high"
8479,OF LOVE,"Their arms in stiff contortion, strain'd and bare;"
8480,OF LOVE,Whose patriarchal crowns in sorrow sigh.
8481,OF LOVE,"So, little children, ye--nay nay, ye ne'er"
8482,OF LOVE,"From me shall learn how sure the change and nigh,"
8483,OF LOVE,When ye shall share our strength and mourn to share.
8484,OF LOVE,
8485,OF LOVE,
8486,OF LOVE,43
8487,OF LOVE,
8488,OF LOVE,"When parch'd with thirst, astray on sultry sand"
8489,OF LOVE,"The traveller faints, upon his closing ear"
8490,OF LOVE,Steals a fantastic music: he may hear
8491,OF LOVE,The babbling fountain of his native land.
8492,OF LOVE,"Before his eyes the vision seems to stand,"
8493,OF LOVE,"Where at its terraced brink the maids appear,"
8494,OF LOVE,"Who fill their deep urns at its waters clear,"
8495,OF LOVE,And not refuse the help of lover's hand.
8496,OF LOVE,
8497,OF LOVE,"O cruel jest--he cries, as some one flings"
8498,OF LOVE,The sparkling drops in sport or shew of ire--
8499,OF LOVE,"O shameless, O contempt of holy things."
8500,OF LOVE,"But never of their wanton play they tire,"
8501,OF LOVE,"As not athirst they sit beside the springs,"
8502,OF LOVE,While he must quench in death his lost desire.
8503,OF LOVE,
8504,OF LOVE,
8505,OF LOVE,44
8506,OF LOVE,
8507,OF LOVE,"The image of thy love, rising on dark"
8508,OF LOVE,"And desperate days over my sullen sea,"
8509,OF LOVE,"Wakens again fresh hope and peace in me,"
8510,OF LOVE,Gleaming above upon my groaning bark.
8511,OF LOVE,"Whate'er my sorrow be, I then may hark"
8512,OF LOVE,"A loving voice: whate'er my terror be,"
8513,OF LOVE,"This heavenly comfort still I win from thee,"
8514,OF LOVE,To shine my lodestar that wert once my mark.
8515,OF LOVE,
8516,OF LOVE,Prodigal nature makes us but to taste
8517,OF LOVE,"One perfect joy, which given she niggard grows;"
8518,OF LOVE,"And lest her precious gift should run to waste,"
8519,OF LOVE,Adds to its loss a thousand lesser woes:
8520,OF LOVE,So to the memory of the gift that graced
8521,OF LOVE,"Her hand, her graceless hand more grace bestows."
8522,OF LOVE,
8523,OF LOVE,
8524,OF LOVE,45
8525,OF LOVE,
8526,OF LOVE,"In this neglected, ruin'd edifice"
8527,OF LOVE,"Of works unperfected and broken schemes,"
8528,OF LOVE,"Where is the promise of my early dreams,"
8529,OF LOVE,The smile of beauty and the pearl of price?
8530,OF LOVE,No charm is left now that could once entice
8531,OF LOVE,"Wind-wavering fortune from her golden streams,"
8532,OF LOVE,"And full in flight decrepit purpose seems,"
8533,OF LOVE,Trailing the banner of his old device.
8534,OF LOVE,
8535,OF LOVE,Within the house a frore and numbing air
8536,OF LOVE,Has chill'd endeavour: sickly memories reign
8537,OF LOVE,"In every room, and ghosts are on the stair:"
8538,OF LOVE,And hope behind the dusty window-pane
8539,OF LOVE,"Watches the days go by, and bow'd with care"
8540,OF LOVE,Forecasts her last reproach and mortal stain.
8541,OF LOVE,
8542,OF LOVE,
8543,OF LOVE,46
8544,OF LOVE,
8545,OF LOVE,"Once I would say, before thy vision came,"
8546,OF LOVE,"_My joy_, _my life_, _my love_, and with some kind"
8547,OF LOVE,"Of knowledge speak, and think I knew my mind"
8548,OF LOVE,"Of heaven and hope, and each word hit its aim."
8549,OF LOVE,"Whate'er their sounds be, now all mean the same,"
8550,OF LOVE,Denoting each the fair that none can find;
8551,OF LOVE,"Or if I say them, 'tis as one long blind"
8552,OF LOVE,Forgets the sights that he was used to name.
8553,OF LOVE,
8554,OF LOVE,"Now if men speak of love, 'tis not my love;"
8555,OF LOVE,"Nor are their hopes nor joys mine, nor their life"
8556,OF LOVE,Of praise the life that I think honour of:
8557,OF LOVE,Nay tho' they turn from house and child and wife
8558,OF LOVE,"And self, and in the thought of heaven above"
8559,OF LOVE,"Hold, as do I, all mortal things at strife."
8560,OF LOVE,
8561,OF LOVE,
8562,OF LOVE,47
8563,OF LOVE,
8564,OF LOVE,"Since then 'tis only pity looking back,"
8565,OF LOVE,"Fear looking forward, and the busy mind"
8566,OF LOVE,Will in one woeful moment more upwind
8567,OF LOVE,Than lifelong years unroll of bitter or black;
8568,OF LOVE,"What is man's privilege, his hoarding knack"
8569,OF LOVE,"Of memory with foreboding so combined,"
8570,OF LOVE,Whereby he comes to dream he hath of kind
8571,OF LOVE,The perpetuity which all things lack?
8572,OF LOVE,
8573,OF LOVE,"Which but to hope is doubtful joy, to have"
8574,OF LOVE,"Being a continuance of what, alas,"
8575,OF LOVE,"We mourn, and scarcely bear with to the grave;"
8576,OF LOVE,Or something so unknown that it o'erpass
8577,OF LOVE,"The thought of comfort, and the sense that gave"
8578,OF LOVE,Cannot consider it thro' any glass.
8579,OF LOVE,
8580,OF LOVE,
8581,OF LOVE,48
8582,OF LOVE,
8583,OF LOVE,"Come gentle sleep, I woo thee: come and take"
8584,OF LOVE,"Not now the child into thine arms, from fright"
8585,OF LOVE,"Composed by drowsy tune and shaded light,"
8586,OF LOVE,Whom ignorant of thee thou didst nurse and make;
8587,OF LOVE,"Nor now the boy, who scorn'd thee for the sake"
8588,OF LOVE,"Of growing knowledge or mysterious night,"
8589,OF LOVE,"Tho' with fatigue thou didst his limbs invite,"
8590,OF LOVE,And heavily weigh the eyes that would not wake;
8591,OF LOVE,
8592,OF LOVE,"No, nor the man severe, who from his best"
8593,OF LOVE,"Failing, alert fled to thee, that his breath,"
8594,OF LOVE,"Blood, force and fire should come at morn redrest;"
8595,OF LOVE,"But me, from whom thy comfort tarrieth,"
8596,OF LOVE,For all my wakeful prayer sent without rest
8597,OF LOVE,"To thee, O shew and shadow of my death."
8598,OF LOVE,
8599,OF LOVE,
8600,OF LOVE,49
8601,OF LOVE,
8602,OF LOVE,The spirit's eager sense for sad or gay
8603,OF LOVE,Filleth with what he will our vessel full:
8604,OF LOVE,"Be joy his bent, he waiteth not joy's day"
8605,OF LOVE,But like a child at any toy will pull:
8606,OF LOVE,"If sorrow, he will weep for fancy's sake,"
8607,OF LOVE,And spoil heaven's plenty with forbidden care.
8608,OF LOVE,What fortune most denies we slave to take;
8609,OF LOVE,Nor can fate load us more than we can bear.
8610,OF LOVE,
8611,OF LOVE,"Since pleasure with the having disappeareth,"
8612,OF LOVE,"He who hath least in hand hath most at heart,"
8613,OF LOVE,While he keep hope: as he who alway feareth
8614,OF LOVE,A grief that never comes hath yet the smart;
8615,OF LOVE,"And heavier far is our self-wrought distress,"
8616,OF LOVE,"For when God sendeth sorrow, it doth bless."
8617,OF LOVE,
8618,OF LOVE,
8619,OF LOVE,50
8620,OF LOVE,
8621,OF LOVE,The world comes not to an end: her city-hives
8622,OF LOVE,"Swarm with the tokens of a changeless trade,"
8623,OF LOVE,"With rolling wheel, driver and flagging jade,"
8624,OF LOVE,"Rich men and beggars, children, priests and wives."
8625,OF LOVE,"New homes on old are set, as lives on lives;"
8626,OF LOVE,Invention with invention overlaid:
8627,OF LOVE,But still or tool or toy or book or blade
8628,OF LOVE,"Shaped for the hand, that holds and toils and strives."
8629,OF LOVE,
8630,OF LOVE,"The men to-day toil as their fathers taught,"
8631,OF LOVE,With little better'd means; for works depend
8632,OF LOVE,"On works and overlap, and thought on thought:"
8633,OF LOVE,And thro' all change the smiles of hope amend
8634,OF LOVE,"The weariest face, the same love changed in nought:"
8635,OF LOVE,In this thing too the world comes not to an end.
8636,OF LOVE,

8638,OF LOVE,51
8639,OF LOVE,
8640,OF LOVE,"O my uncared-for songs, what are ye worth,"
8641,OF LOVE,That in my secret book with so much care
8642,OF LOVE,"I write you, this one here and that one there,"
8643,OF LOVE,Marking the time and order of your birth?
8644,OF LOVE,"How, with a fancy so unkind to mirth,"
8645,OF LOVE,"A sense so hard, a style so worn and bare,"
8646,OF LOVE,Look ye for any welcome anywhere
8647,OF LOVE,From any shelf or heart-home on the earth?
8648,OF LOVE,
8649,OF LOVE,"Should others ask you this, say then I yearn'd"
8650,OF LOVE,"To write you such as once, when I was young,"
8651,OF LOVE,Finding I should have loved and thereto turn'd.
8652,OF LOVE,'Twere something yet to live again among
8653,OF LOVE,"The gentle youth beloved, and where I learn'd"
8654,OF LOVE,"My art, be there remember'd for my song."
8655,OF LOVE,

8657,OF LOVE,52
8658,OF LOVE,
8659,OF LOVE,"Who takes the census of the living dead,"
8660,OF LOVE,Ere the day come when memory shall o'ercrowd
8661,OF LOVE,"The kingdom of their fame, and for that proud"
8662,OF LOVE,And airy people find no room nor stead?
8663,OF LOVE,"Ere hoarding Time, that ever thrusteth back"
8664,OF LOVE,"The fairest treasures of his ancient store,"
8665,OF LOVE,"Better with best confound, so he may pack"
8666,OF LOVE,"His greedy gatherings closer, more and more?"
8667,OF LOVE,
8668,OF LOVE,"Let the true Muse rewrite her sullied page,"
8669,OF LOVE,"And purge her story of the men of hate,"
8670,OF LOVE,That they go dirgeless down to Satan's rage
8671,OF LOVE,"With all else foul, deform'd and miscreate:"
8672,OF LOVE,She hath full toil to keep the names of love
8673,OF LOVE,"Honour'd on earth, as they are bright above."
8674,OF LOVE,
8675,OF LOVE,
8676,OF LOVE,53
8677,OF LOVE,
8678,OF LOVE,"I heard great Hector sounding war's alarms,"
8679,OF LOVE,"Where thro' the listless ghosts chiding he strode,"
8680,OF LOVE,"As tho' the Greeks besieged his last abode,"
8681,OF LOVE,"And he his Troy's hope still, her king-at-arms."
8682,OF LOVE,"But on those gentle meads, which Lethe charms"
8683,OF LOVE,"With weary oblivion, his passion glow'd"
8684,OF LOVE,"Like the cold night-worm's candle, and only show'd"
8685,OF LOVE,Such mimic flame as neither heats nor harms.
8686,OF LOVE,
8687,OF LOVE,"'Twas plain to read, even by those shadows quaint,"
8688,OF LOVE,"How rude catastrophe had dim'd his day,"
8689,OF LOVE,And blighted all his cheer with stern complaint:
8690,OF LOVE,_To arms! to arms!_ what more the voice would say
8691,OF LOVE,"Was swallow'd in the valleys, and grew faint"
8692,OF LOVE,"Upon the thin air, as he pass'd away."
8693,OF LOVE,
8694,OF LOVE,
8695,OF LOVE,54
8696,OF LOVE,
8697,OF LOVE,Since not the enamour'd sun with glance more fond
8698,OF LOVE,"Kisses the foliage of his sacred tree,"
8699,OF LOVE,"Than doth my waking thought arise on thee,"
8700,OF LOVE,"Loving none near thee, like thee nor beyond;"
8701,OF LOVE,"Nay, since I am sworn thy slave, and in the bond"
8702,OF LOVE,Is writ my promise of eternity;
8703,OF LOVE,"Since to such high hope thou'st encouraged me,"
8704,OF LOVE,That if thou look but from me I despond;
8705,OF LOVE,
8706,OF LOVE,"Since thou'rt my all in all, O think of this:"
8707,OF LOVE,Think of the dedication of my youth:
8708,OF LOVE,"Think of my loyalty, my joy, my bliss:"
8709,OF LOVE,"Think of my sorrow, my despair and ruth,"
8710,OF LOVE,My sheer annihilation if I miss:
8711,OF LOVE,Think--if thou shouldst be false--think of thy truth.
8712,OF LOVE,
8713,OF LOVE,
8714,OF LOVE,55
8715,OF LOVE,
8716,OF LOVE,"These meagre rhymes, which a returning mood"
8717,OF LOVE,"Sometimes o'errateth, I as oft despise;"
8718,OF LOVE,"And knowing them illnatured, stiff and rude,"
8719,OF LOVE,See them as others with contemptuous eyes.
8720,OF LOVE,"Nay, and I wonder less at God's respect"
8721,OF LOVE,"For man, a minim jot in time and space,"
8722,OF LOVE,"Than at the soaring faith of His elect,"
8723,OF LOVE,"That gift of gifts, the comfort of His grace."
8724,OF LOVE,
8725,OF LOVE,"O truth unsearchable, O heavenly love,"
8726,OF LOVE,"Most infinitely tender, so to touch"
8727,OF LOVE,The work that we can meanly reckon of:
8728,OF LOVE,Surely--I say--we are favour'd overmuch.
8729,OF LOVE,"But of this wonder, what doth most amaze"
8730,OF LOVE,Is that we know our love is held for praise.
8731,OF LOVE,
8732,OF LOVE,
8733,OF LOVE,56
8734,OF LOVE,
8735,OF LOVE,"Beauty sat with me all the summer day,"
8736,OF LOVE,Awaiting the sure triumph of her eye;
8737,OF LOVE,"Nor mark'd I till we parted, how, hard by,"
8738,OF LOVE,Love in her train stood ready for his prey.
8739,OF LOVE,"She, as too proud to join herself the fray,"
8740,OF LOVE,"Trusting too much to her divine ally,"
8741,OF LOVE,"When she saw victory tarry, chid him--'Why"
8742,OF LOVE,Dost thou not at one stroke this rebel slay?'
8743,OF LOVE,
8744,OF LOVE,"Then generous Love, who holds my heart in fee,"
8745,OF LOVE,Told of our ancient truce: so from the fight
8746,OF LOVE,"We straight withdrew our forces, all the three."
8747,OF LOVE,Baffled but not dishearten'd she took flight
8748,OF LOVE,"Scheming new tactics: Love came home with me,"
8749,OF LOVE,And prompts my measured verses as I write.
8750,OF LOVE,
8751,OF LOVE,
8752,OF LOVE,57
8753,OF LOVE,
8754,OF LOVE,"In autumn moonlight, when the white air wan"
8755,OF LOVE,"Is fragrant in the wake of summer hence,"
8756,OF LOVE,"'Tis sweet to sit entranced, and muse thereon"
8757,OF LOVE,In melancholy and godlike indolence:
8758,OF LOVE,"When the proud spirit, lull'd by mortal prime"
8759,OF LOVE,"To fond pretence of immortality,"
8760,OF LOVE,"Vieweth all moments from the birth of time,"
8761,OF LOVE,All things whate'er have been or yet shall be.
8762,OF LOVE,
8763,OF LOVE,"And like the garden, where the year is spent,"
8764,OF LOVE,"The ruin of old life is full of yearning,"
8765,OF LOVE,Mingling poetic rapture of lament
8766,OF LOVE,With flowers and sunshine of spring's sure returning;
8767,OF LOVE,Only in visions of the white air wan
8768,OF LOVE,By godlike fancy seized and dwelt upon.
8769,OF LOVE,
8770,OF LOVE,
8771,OF LOVE,58
8772,OF LOVE,
8773,OF LOVE,"When first I saw thee, dearest, if I say"
8774,OF LOVE,"The spells that conjure back the hour and place,"
8775,OF LOVE,"And evermore I look upon thy face,"
8776,OF LOVE,As in the spring of years long pass'd away;
8777,OF LOVE,"No fading of thy beauty's rich array,"
8778,OF LOVE,"No detriment of age on thee I trace,"
8779,OF LOVE,"But time's defeat written in spoils of grace,"
8780,OF LOVE,"From rivals robb'd, whom thou didst pity and slay."
8781,OF LOVE,
8782,OF LOVE,"So hath thy growth been, thus thy faith is true,"
8783,OF LOVE,"Unchanged in change, still to my growing sense,"
8784,OF LOVE,"To life's desire the same, and nothing new:"
8785,OF LOVE,But as thou wert in dream and prescience
8786,OF LOVE,"At love's arising, now thou stand'st to view"
8787,OF LOVE,In the broad noon of his magnificence.
8788,OF LOVE,
8789,OF LOVE,
8790,OF LOVE,59
8791,OF LOVE,
8792,OF LOVE,'Twas on the very day winter took leave
8793,OF LOVE,"Of those fair fields I love, when to the skies"
8794,OF LOVE,The fragrant Earth was smiling in surprise
8795,OF LOVE,"At that her heaven-descended, quick reprieve,"
8796,OF LOVE,I wander'd forth my sorrow to relieve;
8797,OF LOVE,Yet walk'd amid sweet pleasure in such wise
8798,OF LOVE,"As Adam went alone in Paradise,"
8799,OF LOVE,Before God of His pity fashion'd Eve.
8800,OF LOVE,
8801,OF LOVE,And out of tune with all the joy around
8802,OF LOVE,"I laid me down beneath a flowering tree,"
8803,OF LOVE,And o'er my senses crept a sleep profound;
8804,OF LOVE,"In which it seem'd that thou wert given to me,"
8805,OF LOVE,"Rending my body, where with hurried sound"
8806,OF LOVE,"I feel my heart beat, when I think of thee."
8807,OF LOVE,
8808,OF LOVE,
8809,OF LOVE,60
8810,OF LOVE,
8811,OF LOVE,"Love that I know, love I am wise in, love,"
8812,OF LOVE,"My strength, my pride, my grace, my skill untaught,"
8813,OF LOVE,"My faith here upon earth, my hope above,"
8814,OF LOVE,My contemplation and perpetual thought:
8815,OF LOVE,"The pleasure of my fancy, my heart's fire,"
8816,OF LOVE,"My joy, my peace, my praise, my happy theme,"
8817,OF LOVE,"The aim of all my doing, my desire"
8818,OF LOVE,"Of being, my life by day, by night my dream:"
8819,OF LOVE,
8820,OF LOVE,"Love, my sweet melancholy, my distress,"
8821,OF LOVE,"My pain, my doubt, my trouble, my despair,"
8822,OF LOVE,"My only folly and unhappiness,"
8823,OF LOVE,And in my careless moments still my care:
8824,OF LOVE,"O love, sweet love, earthly love, love divine,"
8825,OF LOVE,"Say'st thou to-day, O love, that thou art mine?"
8826,OF LOVE,
8827,OF LOVE,
8828,OF LOVE,61
8829,OF LOVE,
8830,OF LOVE,"The dark and serious angel, who so long"
8831,OF LOVE,"Vex'd his immortal strength in charge of me,"
8832,OF LOVE,Hath smiled for joy and fled in liberty
8833,OF LOVE,To take his pastime with the peerless throng.
8834,OF LOVE,"Oft had I done his noble keeping wrong,"
8835,OF LOVE,Wounding his heart to wonder what might be
8836,OF LOVE,God's purpose in a soul of such degree;
8837,OF LOVE,And there he had left me but for mandate strong.
8838,OF LOVE,
8839,OF LOVE,"But seeing thee with me now, his task at close"
8840,OF LOVE,"He knoweth, and wherefore he was bid to stay,"
8841,OF LOVE,And work confusion of so many foes:
8842,OF LOVE,"The thanks that he doth look for, here I pay,"
8843,OF LOVE,"Yet fear some heavenly envy, as he goes"
8844,OF LOVE,Unto what great reward I cannot say.
8845,OF LOVE,
8846,OF LOVE,
8847,OF LOVE,62
8848,OF LOVE,
8849,OF LOVE,"I will be what God made me, nor protest"
8850,OF LOVE,"Against the bent of genius in my time,"
8851,OF LOVE,"That science of my friends robs all the best,"
8852,OF LOVE,"While I love beauty, and was born to rhyme."
8853,OF LOVE,"Be they our mighty men, and let me dwell"
8854,OF LOVE,"In shadow among the mighty shades of old,"
8855,OF LOVE,With love's forsaken palace for my cell;
8856,OF LOVE,"Whence I look forth and all the world behold,"
8857,OF LOVE,
8858,OF LOVE,"And say, These better days, in best things worse,"
8859,OF LOVE,"This bastardy of time's magnificence,"
8860,OF LOVE,"Will mend in fashion and throw off the curse,"
8861,OF LOVE,To crown new love with higher excellence.
8862,OF LOVE,"Curs'd tho' I be to live my life alone,"
8863,OF LOVE,"My toil is for man's joy, his joy my own."
8864,OF LOVE,
8865,OF LOVE,
8866,OF LOVE,63
8867,OF LOVE,
8868,OF LOVE,I live on hope and that I think do all
8869,OF LOVE,"Who come into this world, and since I see"
8870,OF LOVE,"Myself in swim with such good company,"
8871,OF LOVE,I take my comfort whatsoe'er befall.
8872,OF LOVE,"I abide and abide, as if more stout and tall"
8873,OF LOVE,My spirit would grow by waiting like a tree;
8874,OF LOVE,"And, clear of others' toil, it pleaseth me"
8875,OF LOVE,In dreams their quick ambition to forestall.
8876,OF LOVE,
8877,OF LOVE,And if thro' careless eagerness I slide
8878,OF LOVE,"To some accomplishment, I give my voice"
8879,OF LOVE,"Still to desire, and in desire abide."
8880,OF LOVE,I have no stake abroad; if I rejoice
8881,OF LOVE,"In what is done or doing, I confide"
8882,OF LOVE,Neither to friend nor foe my secret choice.
8883,OF LOVE,
8884,OF LOVE,
8885,OF LOVE,64
8886,OF LOVE,
8887,OF LOVE,"Ye blessed saints, that now in heaven enjoy"
8888,OF LOVE,"The purchase of those tears, the world's disdain,"
8889,OF LOVE,"Doth Love still with his war your peace annoy,"
8890,OF LOVE,Or hath Death freed you from his ancient pain?
8891,OF LOVE,"Have ye no springtide, and no burst of May"
8892,OF LOVE,"In flowers and leafy trees, when solemn night"
8893,OF LOVE,"Pants with love-music, and the holy day"
8894,OF LOVE,Breaks on the ear with songs of heavenly light?
8895,OF LOVE,
8896,OF LOVE,What make ye and what strive for? keep ye thought
8897,OF LOVE,"Of us, or in new excellence divine"
8898,OF LOVE,Is old forgot? or do ye count for nought
8899,OF LOVE,What the Greek did and what the Florentine?
8900,OF LOVE,We keep your memories well: O in your store
8901,OF LOVE,Live not our best joys treasured evermore?
8902,OF LOVE,
8903,OF LOVE,
8904,OF LOVE,65
8905,OF LOVE,
8906,OF LOVE,"Ah heavenly joy! But who hath ever heard,"
8907,OF LOVE,"Who hath seen joy, or who shall ever find"
8908,OF LOVE,Joy's language? There is neither speech nor word;
8909,OF LOVE,Nought but itself to teach it to mankind.
8910,OF LOVE,Scarce in our twenty thousand painful days
8911,OF LOVE,We may touch something: but there lives--beyond
8912,OF LOVE,"The best of art, or nature's kindest phase--"
8913,OF LOVE,The hope whereof our spirit is fain and fond:
8914,OF LOVE,
8915,OF LOVE,The cause of beauty given to man's desires
8916,OF LOVE,"Writ in the expectancy of starry skies,"
8917,OF LOVE,"The faith which gloweth in our fleeting fires,"
8918,OF LOVE,The aim of all the good that here we prize;
8919,OF LOVE,"Which but to love, pursue and pray for well"
8920,OF LOVE,"Maketh earth heaven, and to forget it, hell."
8921,OF LOVE,
8922,OF LOVE,
8923,OF LOVE,66
8924,OF LOVE,
8925,OF LOVE,"My wearied heart, whenever, after all,"
8926,OF LOVE,"Its loves and yearnings shall be told complete,"
8927,OF LOVE,"When gentle death shall bid it cease to beat,"
8928,OF LOVE,And from all dear illusions disenthrall:
8929,OF LOVE,However then thou shalt appear to call
8930,OF LOVE,"My fearful heart, since down at others' feet"
8931,OF LOVE,"It bade me kneel so oft, I'll not retreat"
8932,OF LOVE,"From thee, nor fear before thy feet to fall."
8933,OF LOVE,
8934,OF LOVE,"And I shall say, 'Receive this loving heart"
8935,OF LOVE,Which err'd in sorrow only; and in sin
8936,OF LOVE,Took no delight; but being forced apart
8937,OF LOVE,"From thee, without thee hoping thee to win,"
8938,OF LOVE,Most prized what most thou madest as thou art
8939,OF LOVE,"On earth, till heaven were open to enter in.'"
8940,OF LOVE,
8941,OF LOVE,
8942,OF LOVE,67
8943,OF LOVE,
8944,OF LOVE,"Dreary was winter, wet with changeful sting"
8945,OF LOVE,Of clinging snowfall and fast-flying frost;
8946,OF LOVE,"And bitterer northwinds then withheld the spring,"
8947,OF LOVE,That dallied with her promise till 'twas lost.
8948,OF LOVE,A sunless and half-hearted summer drown'd
8949,OF LOVE,The flowers in needful and unwelcom'd rain;
8950,OF LOVE,And Autumn with a sad smile fled uncrown'd
8951,OF LOVE,From fruitless orchards and unripen'd grain.
8952,OF LOVE,
8953,OF LOVE,But coud the skies of this most desolate year
8954,OF LOVE,"In its last month learn with our love to glow,"
8955,OF LOVE,Men yet should rank its cloudless atmosphere
8956,OF LOVE,Above the sunsets of five years ago:
8957,OF LOVE,"Of my great praise too part should be its own,"
8958,OF LOVE,Now reckon'd peerless for thy love alone.
8959,OF LOVE,
8960,OF LOVE,
8961,OF LOVE,68
8962,OF LOVE,
8963,OF LOVE,"Away now, lovely Muse, roam and be free:"
8964,OF LOVE,"Our commerce ends for aye, thy task is done:"
8965,OF LOVE,"Tho' to win thee I left all else unwon,"
8966,OF LOVE,"Thou, whom I most have won, art not for me."
8967,OF LOVE,"My first desire, thou too forgone must be,"
8968,OF LOVE,"Thou too, O much lamented now, tho' none"
8969,OF LOVE,"Will turn to pity thy forsaken son,"
8970,OF LOVE,Nor thy divine sisters will weep for thee.
8971,OF LOVE,
8972,OF LOVE,"None will weep for thee: thou return, O Muse,"
8973,OF LOVE,To thy Sicilian fields: I once have been
8974,OF LOVE,"On thy loved hills, and where thou first didst use"
8975,OF LOVE,"Thy sweetly balanced rhyme, O thankless queen,"
8976,OF LOVE,Have pluck'd and wreath'd thy flowers; but do thou choose
8977,OF LOVE,Some happier brow to wear thy garlands green.
8978,OF LOVE,
8979,OF LOVE,
8980,OF LOVE,69
8981,OF LOVE,
8982,OF LOVE,"Eternal Father, who didst all create,"
8983,OF LOVE,"In whom we live, and to whose bosom move,"
8984,OF LOVE,"To all men be Thy name known, which is Love,"
8985,OF LOVE,Till its loud praises sound at heaven's high gate.
8986,OF LOVE,"Perfect Thy kingdom in our passing state,"
8987,OF LOVE,That here on earth Thou may'st as well approve
8988,OF LOVE,"Our service, as Thou ownest theirs above,"
8989,OF LOVE,Whose joy we echo and in pain await.
8990,OF LOVE,
8991,OF LOVE,Grant body and soul each day their daily bread:
8992,OF LOVE,"And should in spite of grace fresh woe begin,"
8993,OF LOVE,Even as our anger soon is past and dead
8994,OF LOVE,Be Thy remembrance mortal of our sin:
8995,OF LOVE,"By Thee in paths of peace Thy sheep be led,"
8996,OF LOVE,And in the vale of terror comforted.

9043,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
9044,ELEGY,"Known and loved so long,"
9045,ELEGY,That hast heard the song
9046,ELEGY,And the idle dream
9047,ELEGY,Of my boyish day;
9048,ELEGY,While I once again
9049,ELEGY,"Down thy margin stray,"
9050,ELEGY,In the selfsame strain
9051,ELEGY,"Still my voice is spent,"
9052,ELEGY,With my old lament
9053,ELEGY,"And my idle dream,"
9054,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
9055,ELEGY,
9056,ELEGY,Where my old seat was
9057,ELEGY,"Here again I sit,"
9058,ELEGY,Where the long boughs knit
9059,ELEGY,Over stream and grass
9060,ELEGY,A translucent eaves:
9061,ELEGY,Where back eddies play
9062,ELEGY,"Shipwreck with the leaves,"
9063,ELEGY,"And the proud swans stray,"
9064,ELEGY,Sailing one by one
9065,ELEGY,"Out of stream and sun,"
9066,ELEGY,And the fish lie cool
9067,ELEGY,In their chosen pool.
9068,ELEGY,
9069,ELEGY,Many an afternoon
9070,ELEGY,Of the summer day
9071,ELEGY,Dreaming here I lay;
9072,ELEGY,"And I know how soon,"
9073,ELEGY,"Idly at its hour,"
9074,ELEGY,First the deep bell hums
9075,ELEGY,"From the minster tower,"
9076,ELEGY,"And then evening comes,"
9077,ELEGY,"Creeping up the glade,"
9078,ELEGY,"With her lengthening shade,"
9079,ELEGY,And the tardy boon
9080,ELEGY,Of her brightening moon.
9081,ELEGY,
9082,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
9083,ELEGY,Ere again I go
9084,ELEGY,"Where thou dost not flow,"
9085,ELEGY,Well does it beseem
9086,ELEGY,Thee to hear again
9087,ELEGY,"Once my youthful song,"
9088,ELEGY,That familiar strain
9089,ELEGY,Silent now so long:
9090,ELEGY,Be as I content
9091,ELEGY,With my old lament
9092,ELEGY,"And my idle dream,"
9093,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream.

9098,ELEGY,ELEGY
9099,ELEGY,
9100,ELEGY,The wood is bare: a river-mist is steeping
9101,ELEGY,The trees that winter's chill of life bereaves:
9102,ELEGY,"Only their stiffened boughs break silence, weeping"
9103,ELEGY,Over their fallen leaves;
9104,ELEGY,
9105,ELEGY,"That lie upon the dank earth brown and rotten,"
9106,ELEGY,Miry and matted in the soaking wet:
9107,ELEGY,"Forgotten with the spring, that is forgotten"
9108,ELEGY,By them that can forget.
9109,ELEGY,
9110,ELEGY,"Yet it was here we walked when ferns were springing,"
9111,ELEGY,And through the mossy bank shot bud and blade:-
9112,ELEGY,"Here found in summer, when the birds were singing,"
9113,ELEGY,A green and pleasant shade.
9114,ELEGY,
9115,ELEGY,'Twas here we loved in sunnier days and greener;
9116,ELEGY,"And now, in this disconsolate decay,"

9119,ELEGY,
9120,ELEGY,"For on this path, at every turn and corner,"
9121,ELEGY,The fancy of her figure on me falls;
9122,ELEGY,"Yet walks she with the slow step of a mourner,"
9123,ELEGY,Nor hears my voice that calls.
9124,ELEGY,
9125,ELEGY,"So through my heart there winds a track of feeling,"
9126,ELEGY,"A path of memory, that is all her own:"
9127,ELEGY,Whereto her phantom beauty ever stealing
9128,ELEGY,Haunts the sad spot alone.
9129,ELEGY,
9130,ELEGY,"About her steps the trunks are bare, the branches"
9131,ELEGY,Drip heavy tears upon her downcast head;
9132,ELEGY,"And bleed from unseen wounds that no sun stanches,"
9133,ELEGY,For the year's sun is dead.
9134,ELEGY,
9135,ELEGY,And dead leaves wrap the fruits that summer planted:
9136,ELEGY,And birds that love the South have taken wing.

9147,ELEGY,
9148,ELEGY,"Treasured for love's sweet sake,"
9149,ELEGY,That of joy past
9150,ELEGY,Thou might'st again awake
9151,ELEGY,Memory at last.

9153,ELEGY,Yet is thy perfume sweet;

9158,ELEGY,"Yet, yet recall the glow"
9159,ELEGY,"Of the gazing sun,"
9160,ELEGY,When at thy bush we two

9208,THE OCEAN.,Throw back the garden-gate.
9209,THE OCEAN.,
9210,THE OCEAN.,There in the summer evening
9211,THE OCEAN.,I would bedeck the moon;
9212,THE OCEAN.,I would float down and screen her
9213,THE OCEAN.,From the sun's rays at noon;
9214,THE OCEAN.,
9215,THE OCEAN.,"And if her flowers should languish,"
9216,THE OCEAN.,Or wither in the drought
9217,THE OCEAN.,Upon her tall white lilies
9218,THE OCEAN.,I'd pour my heart's blood out:

9235,A CLOUD.,"I would be blue, and gentle,"

9240,A CLOUD.,"I'd make my depths transparent,"

9242,A CLOUD.,O'er the boat's edge to ponder
9243,A CLOUD.,The sights that swam between.
9244,A CLOUD.,
9245,A CLOUD.,"I would command strange creatures,"

9265,A CLOUD.,I heard a linnet courting

9269,A CLOUD.,His song of love.--
9270,A CLOUD.,I fear my speech distorting
9271,A CLOUD.,His tender love.
9272,A CLOUD.,
9273,A CLOUD.,The phrases of his pleading
9274,A CLOUD.,Were full of young delight;
9275,A CLOUD.,And she that gave him heeding
9276,A CLOUD.,Interpreted aright
9277,A CLOUD.,"His gay, sweet notes,--"
9278,A CLOUD.,"So sadly marred in the reading,--"
9279,A CLOUD.,His tender notes.
9280,A CLOUD.,
9281,A CLOUD.,"And when he ceased, the hearer"
9282,A CLOUD.,"Awaited the refrain,"
9283,A CLOUD.,Till swiftly perching nearer
9284,A CLOUD.,"He sang his song again,"
9285,A CLOUD.,His pretty song:--
9286,A CLOUD.,Would that my verse spake clearer
9287,A CLOUD.,His tender song!
9288,A CLOUD.,
9289,A CLOUD.,"Ye happy, airy creatures!"
9290,A CLOUD.,That in the merry spring
9291,A CLOUD.,Think not of what misfeatures
9292,A CLOUD.,Or cares the year may bring;
9293,A CLOUD.,But unto love
9294,A CLOUD.,"Resign your simple natures,"

9302,A CLOUD.,And all thy vows disownest
9303,A CLOUD.,That sealed my venture wisest;
9304,A CLOUD.,I think thy pride's displeasure
9305,A CLOUD.,Neglects a matchless treasure
9306,A CLOUD.,Exceeding price and measure.
9307,A CLOUD.,
9308,A CLOUD.,"But when again thou smilest,"
9309,A CLOUD.,"And love for love returnest,"
9310,A CLOUD.,"And fear with joy beguilest,"
9311,A CLOUD.,And takest truth in earnest;
9312,A CLOUD.,"Then, though I sheer adore thee,"
9313,A CLOUD.,The sum of my love for thee
9314,A CLOUD.,"Seems poor, scant, and unworthy."

9322,A CLOUD.,Quit in a single kiss?
9323,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
9324,A CLOUD.,
9325,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
9326,A CLOUD.,"If thy words' breath could scare thy deeds,"
9327,A CLOUD.,As the soft south can blow
9328,A CLOUD.,"And toss the feathered seeds,"
9329,A CLOUD.,Then might I let thee go.
9330,A CLOUD.,
9331,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
9332,A CLOUD.,"Had not the great sun seen, I might;"
9333,A CLOUD.,Or were he reckoned slow
9334,A CLOUD.,"To bring the false to light,"
9335,A CLOUD.,Then might I let thee go.
9336,A CLOUD.,
9337,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
9338,A CLOUD.,The stars that crowd the summer skies
9339,A CLOUD.,Have watched us so below
9340,A CLOUD.,"With all their million eyes,"
9341,A CLOUD.,I dare not let thee go.
9342,A CLOUD.,
9343,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.

9345,A CLOUD.,"Now rising late, and now"

9347,A CLOUD.,And shall I let thee go?
9348,A CLOUD.,
9349,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
9350,A CLOUD.,"Have not the young flowers been content,"
9351,A CLOUD.,"Plucked ere their buds could blow,"
9352,A CLOUD.,To seal our sacrament?
9353,A CLOUD.,I cannot let thee go.
9354,A CLOUD.,
9355,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
9356,A CLOUD.,I hold thee by too many bands:
9357,A CLOUD.,"Thou sayest farewell, and lo!"
9358,A CLOUD.,"I have thee by the hands,"
9359,A CLOUD.,And will not let thee go.
9360,A CLOUD.,
9361,A CLOUD.,

9363,A CLOUD.,
9364,A CLOUD.,I found to-day out walking
9365,A CLOUD.,The flower my love loves best.
9366,A CLOUD.,"What, when I stooped to pluck it,"
9367,A CLOUD.,Could dare my hand arrest?
9368,A CLOUD.,
9369,A CLOUD.,Was it a snake lay curling
9370,A CLOUD.,About the root's thick crown?
9371,A CLOUD.,Or did some hidden bramble
9372,A CLOUD.,Tear my hand reaching down?
9373,A CLOUD.,
9374,A CLOUD.,"There was no snake uncurling,"
9375,A CLOUD.,And no thorn wounded me;
9376,A CLOUD.,"'Twas my heart checked me, sighing"
9377,A CLOUD.,She is beyond the sea.

9379,A CLOUD.,
9380,A CLOUD.,9
9381,A CLOUD.,
9382,A CLOUD.,"A poppy grows upon the shore,"
9383,A CLOUD.,Bursts her twin cup in summer late:
9384,A CLOUD.,"Her leaves are glaucous-green and hoar,"
9385,A CLOUD.,"Her petals yellow, delicate."
9386,A CLOUD.,
9387,A CLOUD.,"Oft to her cousins turns her thought,"
9388,A CLOUD.,In wonder if they care that she
9389,A CLOUD.,"Is fed with spray for dew, and caught"
9390,A CLOUD.,By every gale that sweeps the sea.
9391,A CLOUD.,
9392,A CLOUD.,"She has no lovers like the red,"
9393,A CLOUD.,That dances with the noble corn:
9394,A CLOUD.,"Her blossoms on the waves are shed,"
9395,A CLOUD.,Where she stands shivering and forlorn.
9396,A CLOUD.,
9397,A CLOUD.,
9398,A CLOUD.,10
9399,A CLOUD.,
9400,A CLOUD.,Sometimes when my lady sits by me
9401,A CLOUD.,"My rapture's so great, that I tear"
9402,A CLOUD.,"My mind from the thought that she's nigh me,"
9403,A CLOUD.,And strive to forget that she's there.
9404,A CLOUD.,And sometimes when she is away
9405,A CLOUD.,"Her absence so sorely does try me,"
9406,A CLOUD.,"That I shut to my eyes, and assay"
9407,A CLOUD.,To think she is there sitting by me.
9408,A CLOUD.,
9409,A CLOUD.,
9410,A CLOUD.,11
9411,A CLOUD.,
9412,A CLOUD.,"Long are the hours the sun is above,"

9414,A CLOUD.,
9415,A CLOUD.,"I'm away the daylight hours and more,"
9416,A CLOUD.,Yet she comes not down to open the door.
9417,A CLOUD.,
9418,A CLOUD.,"She does not meet me upon the stair,--"
9419,A CLOUD.,She sits in my chamber and waits for me there.
9420,A CLOUD.,
9421,A CLOUD.,As I enter the room she does not move:
9422,A CLOUD.,I always walk straight up to my love;
9423,A CLOUD.,
9424,A CLOUD.,And she lets me take my wonted place
9425,A CLOUD.,"At her side, and gaze in her dear dear face."
9426,A CLOUD.,
9427,A CLOUD.,"There as I sit, from her head thrown back"
9428,A CLOUD.,Her hair falls straight in a shadow black.
9429,A CLOUD.,
9430,A CLOUD.,"Aching and hot as my tired eyes be,"
9431,A CLOUD.,She is all that I wish to see.
9432,A CLOUD.,
9433,A CLOUD.,"And in my wearied and toil-dinned ear,"
9434,A CLOUD.,She says all things that I wish to hear.
9435,A CLOUD.,
9436,A CLOUD.,"Dusky and duskier grows the room,"
9437,A CLOUD.,Yet I see her best in the darker gloom.
9438,A CLOUD.,
9439,A CLOUD.,"When the winter eves are early and cold,"
9440,A CLOUD.,The firelight hours are a dream of gold.
9441,A CLOUD.,
9442,A CLOUD.,"And so I sit here night by night,"
9443,A CLOUD.,In rest and enjoyment of love's delight.
9444,A CLOUD.,
9445,A CLOUD.,"But a knock at the door, a step on the stair"
9446,A CLOUD.,"Will startle, alas, my love from her chair."
9447,A CLOUD.,
9448,A CLOUD.,If a stranger comes she will not stay:
9449,A CLOUD.,At the first alarm she is off and away.
9450,A CLOUD.,
9451,A CLOUD.,"And he wonders, my guest, usurping her throne,"
9452,A CLOUD.,That I sit so much by myself alone.
9453,A CLOUD.,
9454,A CLOUD.,
9455,A CLOUD.,12
9456,A CLOUD.,
9457,A CLOUD.,"Who has not walked upon the shore,"

9459,A CLOUD.,"The day the angry gale is o'er,"
9460,A CLOUD.,The hour the wind has ceased to blow?
9461,A CLOUD.,
9462,A CLOUD.,The horses of the strong south-west
9463,A CLOUD.,"Are pastured round his tropic tent,"
9464,A CLOUD.,Careless how long the ocean's breast
9465,A CLOUD.,Sob on and sigh for passion spent.
9466,A CLOUD.,
9467,A CLOUD.,"The frightened birds, that fled inland"
9468,A CLOUD.,"To house in rock and tower and tree,"
9469,A CLOUD.,"Are gathering on the peaceful strand,"
9470,A CLOUD.,To tempt again the sunny sea;
9471,A CLOUD.,
9472,A CLOUD.,Whereon the timid ships steal out
9473,A CLOUD.,"And laugh to find their foe asleep,"
9474,A CLOUD.,"That lately scattered them about,"
9475,A CLOUD.,And drave them to the fold like sheep.
9476,A CLOUD.,
9477,A CLOUD.,The snow-white clouds he northward chased
9478,A CLOUD.,"Break into phalanx, line, and band:"
9479,A CLOUD.,"All one way to the south they haste,"

9481,A CLOUD.,
9482,A CLOUD.,"From distant hills their shadows creep,"
9483,A CLOUD.,"Arrive in turn and mount the lea,"
9484,A CLOUD.,"And flit across the downs, and leap"
9485,A CLOUD.,Sheer off the cliff upon the sea;
9486,A CLOUD.,
9487,A CLOUD.,And sail and sail far out of sight.
9488,A CLOUD.,"But still I watch their fleecy trains,"

9499,A CLOUD.,"I told my secret out,"
9500,A CLOUD.,That none might be in doubt.
9501,A CLOUD.,
9502,A CLOUD.,"I sang it to the sky,"
9503,A CLOUD.,That veiled his face to hear
9504,A CLOUD.,How far her azure eye
9505,A CLOUD.,Outdoes his splendid sphere;
9506,A CLOUD.,But at her eyelids' name
9507,A CLOUD.,His white clouds fled for shame.
9508,A CLOUD.,
9509,A CLOUD.,"I told it to the trees,"
9510,A CLOUD.,"And to the flowers confest,"

9514,A CLOUD.,Vie with her body bared.
9515,A CLOUD.,
9516,A CLOUD.,"I shouted to the sea,"
9517,A CLOUD.,That set his waves a-prance;
9518,A CLOUD.,"Her floating hair is free,"
9519,A CLOUD.,Free are her feet to dance;
9520,A CLOUD.,"And for thy wrath, I swear"
9521,A CLOUD.,Her frown is more to fear.
9522,A CLOUD.,
9523,A CLOUD.,And as in happy mood
9524,A CLOUD.,"I walked and sang alone,"
9525,A CLOUD.,At eve beside the wood
9526,A CLOUD.,"I met my love, my own:"
9527,A CLOUD.,And sang to her the song

9590,BETROTHED KILLED,"To faithful lovers, that their hearts have plighted."
9591,BETROTHED KILLED,
9592,BETROTHED KILLED,But now for many days the dewy grass
9593,BETROTHED KILLED,Has shown no markings of his feet at morn:
9594,BETROTHED KILLED,And watching she has seen no shadow pass
9595,BETROTHED KILLED,"The moonlit walk, and heard no music borne"
9596,BETROTHED KILLED,Upon her ear forlorn.
9597,BETROTHED KILLED,In vain has she looked out to greet him;
9598,BETROTHED KILLED,"He has not come, he will not come, alas!"
9599,BETROTHED KILLED,So let us bear her out where she must meet him.
9600,BETROTHED KILLED,
9601,BETROTHED KILLED,Now to the river bank the priests are come:
9602,BETROTHED KILLED,The bark is ready to receive its freight:
9603,BETROTHED KILLED,"Let some prepare her place therein, and some"
9604,BETROTHED KILLED,Embark the litter with its slender weight:
9605,BETROTHED KILLED,"The rest stand by in state,"
9606,BETROTHED KILLED,And sing her a safe passage over;
9607,BETROTHED KILLED,"While she is oared across to her new home,"
9608,BETROTHED KILLED,Into the arms of her expectant lover.
9609,BETROTHED KILLED,
9610,BETROTHED KILLED,"And thou, O lover, that art on the watch,"
9611,BETROTHED KILLED,"Where, on the banks of the forgetful streams,"
9612,BETROTHED KILLED,"The pale indifferent ghosts wander, and snatch"
9613,BETROTHED KILLED,"The sweeter moments of their broken dreams,--"
9614,BETROTHED KILLED,"Thou, when the torchlight gleams,"
9615,BETROTHED KILLED,"When thou shalt see the slow procession,"
9616,BETROTHED KILLED,"And when thine ears the fitful music catch,"

9790,LATE SPRING EVENING,While yet the moon's cold flame was hung between
9791,LATE SPRING EVENING,"The day and night, above the dusky town:"
9792,LATE SPRING EVENING,"I saw her brighter than the Western gold,"
9793,LATE SPRING EVENING,Whereto she faced in splendour to behold.
9794,LATE SPRING EVENING,
9795,LATE SPRING EVENING,Her dress was greener than the tenderest leaf
9796,LATE SPRING EVENING,That trembled in the sunset glare aglow:
9797,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Herself more delicate than is the brief,"
9798,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Pink apple-blossom, that May showers lay low,"

9801,LATE SPRING EVENING,
9802,LATE SPRING EVENING,"As if to match the sight that so did please,"
9803,LATE SPRING EVENING,"A music entered, making passion fain:"
9804,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Three nightingales sat singing in the trees,"
9805,LATE SPRING EVENING,And praised the Goddess for the fallen rain;

9837,WOOING,To win the fairest dame
9838,WOOING,That graced my maiden tourney.
9839,WOOING,
9840,WOOING,Chivalry's lovely prize
9841,WOOING,"With all men's gaze upon her,"
9842,WOOING,Why did she free her eyes
9843,WOOING,"On me, to do me honour?"
9844,WOOING,
9845,WOOING,Ah! ne'er had I my mind
9846,WOOING,"With such high hope delighted,"
9847,WOOING,"Had she not first inclined,"
9848,WOOING,And with her eyes invited.
9849,WOOING,
9850,WOOING,"But never doubt I knew,"
9851,WOOING,"Having their glance to cheer me,"
9852,WOOING,Until the day joy grew
9853,WOOING,"Too great, too sure, too near me."
9854,WOOING,
9855,WOOING,"When hope a fear became,"
9856,WOOING,"And passion, grown too tender,"
9857,WOOING,Now trembled at the shame
9858,WOOING,Of a despised surrender;
9859,WOOING,
9860,WOOING,And where my love at first
9861,WOOING,"Saw kindness in her smiling,"
9862,WOOING,"I read her pride, and cursed"
9863,WOOING,The arts of her beguiling.
9864,WOOING,
9865,WOOING,"Till winning less than won,"
9866,WOOING,"And liker wooed than wooing,"
9867,WOOING,Too late I turned undone
9868,WOOING,Away from my undoing;
9869,WOOING,
9870,WOOING,"And stood beside the door,"
9871,WOOING,"Whereto she followed, making"
9872,WOOING,My hard leave-taking more
9873,WOOING,Hard by her sweet leave-taking.
9874,WOOING,
9875,WOOING,Her speech would have betrayed
9876,WOOING,"Her thought, had mine been colder:"
9877,WOOING,Her eyes' distress had made
9878,WOOING,A lesser lover bolder.
9879,WOOING,
9880,WOOING,"But no! Fond heart, distrust,"
9881,WOOING,"Cried Wisdom, and consider:"
9882,WOOING,"Go free, since go thou must:--"
9883,WOOING,And so farewell I bid her.
9884,WOOING,
9885,WOOING,And brisk upon my way
9886,WOOING,"I smote the stroke to sever,"
9887,WOOING,And should have lost that day
9888,WOOING,My life's delight for ever:
9889,WOOING,
9890,WOOING,But when I saw her start
9891,WOOING,And turn aside and tremble;--
9892,WOOING,"Ah! she was true, her heart"
9893,WOOING,I knew did not dissemble.

9901,WOOING,Steeply the thickets to his floods decline.
9902,WOOING,Straight trees in every place
9903,WOOING,"Their thick tops interlace,"
9904,WOOING,And pendant branches trail their foliage fine
9905,WOOING,Upon his watery face.
9906,WOOING,
9907,WOOING,Swift from the sweltering pasturage he flows:
9908,WOOING,"His stream, alert to seek the pleasant shade,"
9909,WOOING,"Pictures his gentle purpose, as he goes"
9910,WOOING,Straight to the caverned pool his toil has made.
9911,WOOING,His winter floods lay bare
9912,WOOING,The stout roots in the air:
9913,WOOING,"His summer streams are cool, when they have played"
9914,WOOING,Among their fibrous hair.
9915,WOOING,
9916,WOOING,"A rushy island guards the sacred bower,"
9917,WOOING,"And hides it from the meadow, where in peace"
9918,WOOING,"The lazy cows wrench many a scented flower,"
9919,WOOING,Robbing the golden market of the bees:
9920,WOOING,And laden barges float
9921,WOOING,By banks of myosote;
9922,WOOING,And scented flag and golden flower-de-lys
9923,WOOING,Delay the loitering boat.
9924,WOOING,
9925,WOOING,"And on this side the island, where the pool"
9926,WOOING,"Eddies away, are tangled mass on mass"
9927,WOOING,"The water-weeds, that net the fishes cool,"
9928,WOOING,And scarce allow a narrow stream to pass;
9929,WOOING,Where spreading crowfoot mars
9930,WOOING,"The drowning nenuphars,"
9931,WOOING,Waving the tassels of her silken grass
9932,WOOING,Below her silver stars.
9933,WOOING,
9934,WOOING,"But in the purple pool there nothing grows,"
9935,WOOING,Not the white water-lily spoked with gold;
9936,WOOING,"Though best she loves the hollows, and well knows"
9937,WOOING,On quiet streams her broad shields to unfold:
9938,WOOING,Yet should her roots but try
9939,WOOING,"Within these deeps to lie,"
9940,WOOING,Not her long reaching stalk could ever hold
9941,WOOING,Her waxen head so high.
9942,WOOING,
9943,WOOING,"Sometimes an angler comes, and drops his hook"
9944,WOOING,"Within its hidden depths, and 'gainst a tree"
9945,WOOING,"Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,"
9946,WOOING,Forgetting soon his pride of fishery;
9947,WOOING,"And dreams, or falls asleep,"
9948,WOOING,While curious fishes peep
9949,WOOING,"About his nibbled bait, or scornfully"
9950,WOOING,Dart off and rise and leap.
9951,WOOING,
9952,WOOING,"And sometimes a slow figure 'neath the trees,"
9953,WOOING,"In ancient-fashioned smock, with tottering care"
9954,WOOING,"Upon a staff propping his weary knees,"
9955,WOOING,May by the pathway of the forest fare:
9956,WOOING,As from a buried day
9957,WOOING,Across the mind will stray
9958,WOOING,"Some perishing mute shadow,--and unaware"
9959,WOOING,He passeth on his way.
9960,WOOING,
9961,WOOING,"Else, he that wishes solitude is safe,"
9962,WOOING,Whether he bathe at morning in the stream:
9963,WOOING,Or lead his love there when the hot hours chafe
9964,WOOING,"The meadows, busy with a blurring steam;"

9973,WOOING,No sharer of my secret I allow:

10704,INDOLENCE,
10705,INDOLENCE,We left the city when the summer day
10706,INDOLENCE,"Had verged already on its hot decline,"
10707,INDOLENCE,And charmÃ¨d Indolence in languor lay
10708,INDOLENCE,"In her gay gardens, 'neath her towers divine:"
10709,INDOLENCE,"'Farewell,' we said, 'dear city of youth and dream!'"
10710,INDOLENCE,And in our boat we stepped and took the stream.
10711,INDOLENCE,
10712,INDOLENCE,All through that idle afternoon we strayed
10713,INDOLENCE,"Upon our proposed travel well begun,"
10714,INDOLENCE,"As loitering by the woodland's dreamy shade,"
10715,INDOLENCE,"Past shallow islets floating in the sun,"
10716,INDOLENCE,Or searching down the banks for rarer flowers
10717,INDOLENCE,We lingered out the pleasurable hours.
10718,INDOLENCE,
10719,INDOLENCE,"Till when that loveliest came, which mowers home"
10720,INDOLENCE,"Turns from their longest labour, as we steered"
10721,INDOLENCE,"Along a straitened channel flecked with foam,"
10722,INDOLENCE,"We lost our landscape wide, and slowly neared"
10723,INDOLENCE,"An ancient bridge, that like a blind wall lay"
10724,INDOLENCE,Low on its buried vaults to block the way.
10725,INDOLENCE,
10726,INDOLENCE,"Then soon the narrow tunnels broader showed,"
10727,INDOLENCE,Where with its arches three it sucked the mass
10728,INDOLENCE,"Of water, that in swirl thereunder flowed,"
10729,INDOLENCE,Or stood piled at the piers waiting to pass;
10730,INDOLENCE,"And pulling for the middle span, we drew"
10731,INDOLENCE,The tender blades aboard and floated through.
10732,INDOLENCE,
10733,INDOLENCE,But past the bridge what change we found below!
10734,INDOLENCE,"The stream, that all day long had laughed and played"
10735,INDOLENCE,"Betwixt the happy shires, ran dark and slow,"
10736,INDOLENCE,And with its easy flood no murmur made:
10737,INDOLENCE,"And weeds spread on its surface, and about"
10738,INDOLENCE,The stagnant margin reared their stout heads out.
10739,INDOLENCE,
10740,INDOLENCE,"Upon the left high elms, with giant wood"
10741,INDOLENCE,"Skirting the water-meadows, interwove"
10742,INDOLENCE,"Their slumbrous crowns, o'ershadowing where they stood"
10743,INDOLENCE,The floor and heavy pillars of the grove:
10744,INDOLENCE,"And in the shade, through reeds and sedges dank,"
10745,INDOLENCE,A footpath led along the moated bank.
10746,INDOLENCE,
10747,INDOLENCE,"Across, all down the right, an old brick wall,"
10748,INDOLENCE,"Above and o'er the channel, red did lean;"
10749,INDOLENCE,"Here buttressed up, and bulging there to fall,"
10750,INDOLENCE,Tufted with grass and plants and lichen green;
10751,INDOLENCE,"And crumbling to the flood, which at its base"
10752,INDOLENCE,Slid gently nor disturbed its mirrored face.
10753,INDOLENCE,
10754,INDOLENCE,"Sheer on the wall the houses rose, their backs"
10755,INDOLENCE,"All windowless, neglected and awry,"
10756,INDOLENCE,"With tottering coigns, and crooked chimney stacks;"
10757,INDOLENCE,"And here and there an unused door, set high"
10758,INDOLENCE,"Above the fragments of its mouldering stair,"
10759,INDOLENCE,With rail and broken step led out on air.
10760,INDOLENCE,
10761,INDOLENCE,"Beyond, deserted wharfs and vacant sheds,"
10762,INDOLENCE,"With empty boats and barges moored along,"
10763,INDOLENCE,"And rafts half-sunken, fringed with weedy shreds,"
10764,INDOLENCE,"And sodden beams, once soaked to season strong."
10765,INDOLENCE,"No sight of man, nor sight of life, no stroke,"
10766,INDOLENCE,No voice the somnolence and silence broke.
10767,INDOLENCE,
10768,INDOLENCE,"Then I who rowed leant on my oar, whose drip"
10769,INDOLENCE,"Fell without sparkle, and I rowed no more;"
10770,INDOLENCE,"And he that steered moved neither hand nor lip,"
10771,INDOLENCE,But turned his wondering eye from shore to shore;
10772,INDOLENCE,"And our trim boat let her swift motion die,"
10773,INDOLENCE,Between the dim reflections floating by.

10775,INDOLENCE,
10776,INDOLENCE,8
10777,INDOLENCE,
10778,INDOLENCE,"I praise the tender flower,"
10779,INDOLENCE,That on a mournful day
10780,INDOLENCE,Bloomed in my garden bower
10781,INDOLENCE,And made the winter gay.
10782,INDOLENCE,Its loveliness contented
10783,INDOLENCE,My heart tormented.
10784,INDOLENCE,
10785,INDOLENCE,I praise the gentle maid
10786,INDOLENCE,Whose happy voice and smile
10787,INDOLENCE,To confidence betrayed
10788,INDOLENCE,My doleful heart awhile:
10789,INDOLENCE,And gave my spirit deploring
10790,INDOLENCE,Fresh wings for soaring.
10791,INDOLENCE,
10792,INDOLENCE,The maid for very fear
10793,INDOLENCE,Of love I durst not tell:
10794,INDOLENCE,"The rose could never hear,"
10795,INDOLENCE,Though I bespake her well:
10796,INDOLENCE,So in my song I bind them
10797,INDOLENCE,For all to find them.

10802,INDOLENCE,A winter's night with the snow about:
10803,INDOLENCE,'Twas silent within and cold without:
10804,INDOLENCE,Both father and mother to bed were gone:
10805,INDOLENCE,The son sat yet by the fire alone.
10806,INDOLENCE,
10807,INDOLENCE,"He gazed on the fire, and dreamed again"
10808,INDOLENCE,Of one that was now no more among men:
10809,INDOLENCE,As still he sat and never aware
10810,INDOLENCE,How close was the spirit beside his chair.
10811,INDOLENCE,
10812,INDOLENCE,"Nay, sad were his thoughts, for he wept and said"
10813,INDOLENCE,"Ah, woe for the dead! ah, woe for the dead!"
10814,INDOLENCE,"How heavy the earth lies now on her breast,"
10815,INDOLENCE,"The lips that I kissed, and the hand I pressed."
10816,INDOLENCE,
10817,INDOLENCE,"The spirit he saw not, he could not hear"
10818,INDOLENCE,The comforting word she spake in his ear:
10819,INDOLENCE,His heart in the grave with her mouldering clay
10820,INDOLENCE,No welcome gave--and she fled away.

10824,INDOLENCE,
10825,INDOLENCE,"My bed and pillow are cold,"
10826,INDOLENCE,"My heart is faint with dread,"
10827,INDOLENCE,"The air hath an odour of mould,"
10828,INDOLENCE,I dream I lie with the dead:
10829,INDOLENCE,"I cannot move,"
10830,INDOLENCE,"O come to me, Love,"
10831,INDOLENCE,Or else I am dead.
10832,INDOLENCE,
10833,INDOLENCE,The feet I hear on the floor
10834,INDOLENCE,Tread heavily overhead:
10835,INDOLENCE,"O Love, come down to the door,"
10836,INDOLENCE,"Come, Love, come, ere I be dead:"

10842,INDOLENCE,11
10843,INDOLENCE,
10844,INDOLENCE,"O thou unfaithful, still as ever dearest"
10845,INDOLENCE,That in thy beauty to my eyes appearest
10846,INDOLENCE,In fancy rising now to re-awaken
10847,INDOLENCE,My love unshaken;
10848,INDOLENCE,
10849,INDOLENCE,"All thou'st forgotten, but no change can free thee,"
10850,INDOLENCE,"No hate unmake thee; as thou wert I see thee,"
10851,INDOLENCE,"And am contented, eye from fond eye meeting"
10852,INDOLENCE,Its ample greeting.
10853,INDOLENCE,
10854,INDOLENCE,"O thou my star of stars, among things wholly"
10855,INDOLENCE,"Devoted, sacred, dim and melancholy,"
10856,INDOLENCE,The only joy of all the joys I cherished
10857,INDOLENCE,"That hast not perished,"
10858,INDOLENCE,
10859,INDOLENCE,"Why now on others squand'rest thou the treasure,"
10860,INDOLENCE,That to be jealous of is still my pleasure:
10861,INDOLENCE,"As still I dream 'tis me whom thou invitest,"
10862,INDOLENCE,Me thou delightest?
10863,INDOLENCE,
10864,INDOLENCE,"But day by day my joy hath feebler being,"
10865,INDOLENCE,"The fading picture tires my painful seeing,"
10866,INDOLENCE,And faery fancy leaves her habitation
10867,INDOLENCE,To desolation.
10868,INDOLENCE,
10869,INDOLENCE,Of two things open left for lovers parted
10870,INDOLENCE,'Twas thine to scorn the past and go lighthearted:
10871,INDOLENCE,"But I would ever dream I still possess it,"
10872,INDOLENCE,And thus caress it.
10873,INDOLENCE,
10874,INDOLENCE,
10875,INDOLENCE,12
10876,INDOLENCE,
10877,INDOLENCE,Thou didst delight my eyes:
10878,INDOLENCE,Yet who am I? nor first
10879,INDOLENCE,"Nor last nor best, that durst"
10880,INDOLENCE,Once dream of thee for prize;
10881,INDOLENCE,Nor this the only time
10882,INDOLENCE,Thou shalt set love to rhyme.
10883,INDOLENCE,
10884,INDOLENCE,Thou didst delight my ear:
10885,INDOLENCE,Ah! little praise; thy voice
10886,INDOLENCE,"Makes other hearts rejoice,"
10887,INDOLENCE,Makes all ears glad that hear;
10888,INDOLENCE,"And short my joy: but yet,"
10889,INDOLENCE,"O song, do not forget."
10890,INDOLENCE,
10891,INDOLENCE,For what wert thou to me?
10892,INDOLENCE,"How shall I say? The moon,"
10893,INDOLENCE,That poured her midnight noon
10894,INDOLENCE,Upon his wrecking sea;--
10895,INDOLENCE,"A sail, that for a day"
10896,INDOLENCE,Has cheered the castaway.

10898,INDOLENCE,
10899,INDOLENCE,13
10900,INDOLENCE,
10901,INDOLENCE,"Joy, sweetest lifeborn joy, where dost thou dwell?"
10902,INDOLENCE,Upon the formless moments of our being
10903,INDOLENCE,"Flitting, to mock the ear that heareth well,"
10904,INDOLENCE,"To escape the trainÃ¨d eye that strains in seeing,"
10905,INDOLENCE,Dost thou fly with us whither we are fleeing;
10906,INDOLENCE,"Or home in our creations, to withstand"
10907,INDOLENCE,"Black-wingÃ¨d death, that slays the making hand?"
10908,INDOLENCE,
10909,INDOLENCE,"The making mind, that must untimely perish"
10910,INDOLENCE,"Amidst its work which time may not destroy,"
10911,INDOLENCE,"The beauteous forms which man shall love to cherish,"
10912,INDOLENCE,The glorious songs that combat earth's annoy?
10913,INDOLENCE,"Thou dost dwell here, I know, divinest Joy:"
10914,INDOLENCE,"But they who build thy towers fair and strong,"
10915,INDOLENCE,"Of all that toil, feel most of care and wrong."
10916,INDOLENCE,
10917,INDOLENCE,"Sense is so tender, O and hope so high,"
10918,INDOLENCE,That common pleasures mock their hope and sense;
10919,INDOLENCE,And swifter than doth lightning from the sky
10920,INDOLENCE,"The ecstasy they pine for flashes hence,"
10921,INDOLENCE,"Leaving the darkness and the woe immense,"
10922,INDOLENCE,"Wherewith it seems no thread of life was woven,"
10923,INDOLENCE,Nor doth the track remain where once 'twas cloven.
10924,INDOLENCE,
10925,INDOLENCE,And heaven and all the stable elements
10926,INDOLENCE,"That guard God's purpose mock us, though the mind"
10927,INDOLENCE,Be spent in searching: for his old intents
10928,INDOLENCE,We see were never for our joy designed:
10929,INDOLENCE,"They shine as doth the bright sun on the blind,"
10930,INDOLENCE,"Or like his pensioned stars, that hymn above"
10931,INDOLENCE,"His praise, but not toward us, that God is Love."
10932,INDOLENCE,
10933,INDOLENCE,For who so well hath wooed the maiden hours
10934,INDOLENCE,"As quite to have won the worth of their rich show,"
10935,INDOLENCE,"To rob the night of mystery, or the flowers"
10936,INDOLENCE,Of their sweet delicacy ere they go?
10937,INDOLENCE,"Nay, even the dear occasion when we know,"
10938,INDOLENCE,"We miss the joy, and on the gliding day"
10939,INDOLENCE,The special glories float and pass away.
10940,INDOLENCE,
10941,INDOLENCE,Only life's common plod: still to repair
10942,INDOLENCE,The body and the thing which perisheth:
10943,INDOLENCE,"The soil, the smutch, the toil and ache and wear,"
10944,INDOLENCE,"The grinding enginry of blood and breath,"
10945,INDOLENCE,"Pain's random darts, the heartless spade of death;"
10946,INDOLENCE,"All is but grief, and heavily we call"
10947,INDOLENCE,On the last terror for the end of all.
10948,INDOLENCE,
10949,INDOLENCE,Then comes the happy moment: not a stir
10950,INDOLENCE,"In any tree, no portent in the sky:"
10951,INDOLENCE,"The morn doth neither hasten nor defer,"
10952,INDOLENCE,"The morrow hath no name to call it by,"
10953,INDOLENCE,"But life and joy are one,--we know not why,--"
10954,INDOLENCE,As though our very blood long breathless lain
10955,INDOLENCE,Had tasted of the breath of God again.
10956,INDOLENCE,
10957,INDOLENCE,"And having tasted it I speak of it,"
10958,INDOLENCE,And praise him thinking how I trembled then
10959,INDOLENCE,"When his touch strengthened me, as now I sit"
10960,INDOLENCE,"In wonder, reaching out beyond my ken,"
10961,INDOLENCE,"Reaching to turn the day back, and my pen"
10962,INDOLENCE,Urging to tell a tale which told would seem
10963,INDOLENCE,The witless phantasy of them that dream.
10964,INDOLENCE,
10965,INDOLENCE,"But O most blessÃ¨d truth, for truth thou art,"
10966,INDOLENCE,Abide thou with me till my life shall end.
10967,INDOLENCE,Divinity hath surely touched my heart;
10968,INDOLENCE,I have possessed more joy than earth can lend:
10969,INDOLENCE,I may attain what time shall never spend.
10970,INDOLENCE,Only let not my duller days destroy
10971,INDOLENCE,The memory of thy witness and my joy.

10978,INDOLENCE,And from the hour when she doth rise
10979,INDOLENCE,"Till when she sets, none else will see."
10980,INDOLENCE,
10981,INDOLENCE,"One only other ray she hath,"
10982,INDOLENCE,"That makes an angle close with mine,"
10983,INDOLENCE,And glancing down its happy path
10984,INDOLENCE,Upon another spot doth shine.
10985,INDOLENCE,
10986,INDOLENCE,"But that ray too is sent to me,"
10987,INDOLENCE,For where it lights there dwells my heart:
10988,INDOLENCE,"And if I were where I would be,"
10989,INDOLENCE,"Both rays would shine, love, where thou art."

10995,INDOLENCE,"The darkness silvers away, the morn doth break,"
10996,INDOLENCE,It leaps in the sky: unrisen lustres slake
10997,INDOLENCE,"The o'ertaken moon. Awake, O heart, awake!"
10998,INDOLENCE,
10999,INDOLENCE,She too that loveth awaketh and hopes for thee;
11000,INDOLENCE,"Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee,"
11001,INDOLENCE,Already they watch the path thy feet shall take:
11002,INDOLENCE,"Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!"
11003,INDOLENCE,
11004,INDOLENCE,"And if thou tarry from her,--if this could be,--"
11005,INDOLENCE,"She cometh herself, O heart, to be loved, to thee;"
11006,INDOLENCE,For thee would unashamÃ¨d herself forsake:
11007,INDOLENCE,"Awake to be loved, my heart, awake, awake!"
11008,INDOLENCE,
11009,INDOLENCE,"Awake, the land is scattered with light, and see,"
11010,INDOLENCE,Uncanopied sleep is flying from field and tree:
11011,INDOLENCE,And blossoming boughs of April in laughter shake;
11012,INDOLENCE,"Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!"
11013,INDOLENCE,
11014,INDOLENCE,Lo all things wake and tarry and look for thee:
11015,INDOLENCE,"She looketh and saith, 'O sun, now bring him to me."
11016,INDOLENCE,"Come more adored, O adored, for his coming's sake,"
11017,INDOLENCE,"And awake my heart to be loved: awake, awake!'"

11240,"LAST WEEK OF FEBRUARY, 1890",His broken home:

11252,"APRIL, 1885",All day in the sweet box-tree the bee for pleasure hummeth:
11253,"APRIL, 1885",The cuckoo sends afloat his note on the air all day.
11254,"APRIL, 1885",
11255,"APRIL, 1885",Now dewy nights again and rain in gentle shower
11256,"APRIL, 1885",At root of tree and flower have quenched the winter's drouth:

11283,"APRIL, 1885",And there in the green
11284,"APRIL, 1885",Early and late
11285,"APRIL, 1885",Alone to his mate
11286,"APRIL, 1885",He pipeth unseen

11326,"APRIL, 1885","Among the best to dare,"
11327,"APRIL, 1885",In thy high courts that bowed the knee
11328,"APRIL, 1885",With sacrifice and prayer?
11329,"APRIL, 1885",
11330,"APRIL, 1885",Their mighty offerings at thy shrine
11331,"APRIL, 1885","Shamed me, who nothing bore"
11332,"APRIL, 1885","Their suits were mockeries of mine,"
11333,"APRIL, 1885",I sued for so much more.
11334,"APRIL, 1885",
11335,"APRIL, 1885",Full many I met that crowned with bay

11337,"APRIL, 1885",And many a master on the way
11338,"APRIL, 1885",Proud of the prize I scorned.
11339,"APRIL, 1885",
11340,"APRIL, 1885",I wished no garland on my head

11343,"APRIL, 1885","My prayer thy high command,"
11344,"APRIL, 1885",

11357,"APRIL, 1885",
11358,"APRIL, 1885","Now never from him do I part,"

11374,"APRIL, 1885",Blotted the pleasant May.
11375,"APRIL, 1885",
11376,"APRIL, 1885",But deep in the glen's bosom
11377,"APRIL, 1885",Summer slept in the fire
11378,"APRIL, 1885",Of the odorous gorse-blossom
11379,"APRIL, 1885",And the hot scent of the brier.
11380,"APRIL, 1885",
11381,"APRIL, 1885","A ribald cuckoo clamoured,"
11382,"APRIL, 1885",And out of the copse the stroke

11384,"APRIL, 1885",The iron heart of the oak.
11385,"APRIL, 1885",
11386,"APRIL, 1885","Anon a sound appalling,"

11388,"APRIL, 1885","Crashed, in the silence falling:"
11389,"APRIL, 1885",And the shadowy pine-trees sighed.

11394,THE WINDMILL,THE WINDMILL
11395,THE WINDMILL,
11396,THE WINDMILL,"The green corn waving in the dale,"
11397,THE WINDMILL,The ripe grass waving on the hill:
11398,THE WINDMILL,I lean across the paddock pale
11399,THE WINDMILL,And gaze upon the giddy mill.
11400,THE WINDMILL,
11401,THE WINDMILL,Its hurtling sails a mighty sweep
11402,THE WINDMILL,Cut thro' the air: with rushing sound
11403,THE WINDMILL,"Each strikes in fury down the steep,"
11404,THE WINDMILL,"Rattles, and whirls in chase around."
11405,THE WINDMILL,
11406,THE WINDMILL,Beside his sacks the miller stands
11407,THE WINDMILL,On high within the open door:
11408,THE WINDMILL,"A book and pencil in his hands,"
11409,THE WINDMILL,His grist and meal he reckoneth o'er.
11410,THE WINDMILL,
11411,THE WINDMILL,His tireless merry slave the wind
11412,THE WINDMILL,Is busy with his work to-day:
11413,THE WINDMILL,"From whencesoe'er, he comes to grind;"
11414,THE WINDMILL,He hath a will and knows the way.
11415,THE WINDMILL,
11416,THE WINDMILL,"He gives the creaking sails a spin,"
11417,THE WINDMILL,"The circling millstones faster flee,"
11418,THE WINDMILL,"The shuddering timbers groan within,"
11419,THE WINDMILL,And down the shoot the meal runs free.
11420,THE WINDMILL,
11421,THE WINDMILL,"The miller giveth him no thanks,"
11422,THE WINDMILL,And doth not much his work o'erlook:
11423,THE WINDMILL,"He stands beside the sacks, and ranks"
11424,THE WINDMILL,The figures in his dusty book.

11428,THE WINDMILL,
11429,THE WINDMILL,"When June is come, then all the day"
11430,THE WINDMILL,I'll sit with my love in the scented hay:
11431,THE WINDMILL,"And watch the sunshot palaces high,"
11432,THE WINDMILL,That the white clouds build in the breezy sky.
11433,THE WINDMILL,
11434,THE WINDMILL,"She singeth, and I do make her a song,"
11435,THE WINDMILL,And read sweet poems the whole day long:
11436,THE WINDMILL,Unseen as we lie in our haybuilt home.
11437,THE WINDMILL,O life is delight when June is come.

11445,THE WINDMILL,And blue forget-me-not.
11446,THE WINDMILL,
11447,THE WINDMILL,Their dazzling snows forth-bursting soon
11448,THE WINDMILL,Will lade the idle breath of June:
11449,THE WINDMILL,And waken thro' the fragrant night
11450,THE WINDMILL,To steal the pale moonlight.
11451,THE WINDMILL,
11452,THE WINDMILL,The nightingale at end of May
11453,THE WINDMILL,Lingers each year for their display;
11454,THE WINDMILL,"Till when he sees their blossoms blown,"
11455,THE WINDMILL,He knows the spring is flown.
11456,THE WINDMILL,
11457,THE WINDMILL,"June's birth they greet, and when their bloom"
11458,THE WINDMILL,"Dislustres, withering on his tomb,"
11459,THE WINDMILL,Then summer hath a shortening day;
11460,THE WINDMILL,And steps slow to decay.

11467,THE WINDMILL,"Molten spheres, whose tempests narrow"
11468,THE WINDMILL,"Their floods to a beam of gentle light,"
11469,THE WINDMILL,To charm with a moon-ray quenched from fire
11470,THE WINDMILL,"The land of delight, the land of desire!"
11471,THE WINDMILL,
11472,THE WINDMILL,"Smile of love, a flower planted,"
11473,THE WINDMILL,Sprung in the garden of joy that art:
11474,THE WINDMILL,"Eyes that shine with a glow enchanted,"
11475,THE WINDMILL,"Whose spreading fires encircle my heart,"
11476,THE WINDMILL,And warm with a noon-ray drenched in fire
11477,THE WINDMILL,"My land of delight, my land of desire!"

11479,THE WINDMILL,
11480,THE WINDMILL,17
11481,THE WINDMILL,
11482,THE WINDMILL,The idle life I lead
11483,THE WINDMILL,"Is like a pleasant sleep,"
11484,THE WINDMILL,Wherein I rest and heed
11485,THE WINDMILL,The dreams that by me sweep.
11486,THE WINDMILL,
11487,THE WINDMILL,And still of all my dreams
11488,THE WINDMILL,"In turn so swiftly past,"
11489,THE WINDMILL,Each in its fancy seems
11490,THE WINDMILL,A nobler than the last.
11491,THE WINDMILL,
11492,THE WINDMILL,"And every eve I say,"
11493,THE WINDMILL,"Noting my step in bliss,"
11494,THE WINDMILL,That I have known no day
11495,THE WINDMILL,In all my life like this.

11504,THE WINDMILL,And the sad moonbeam
11505,THE WINDMILL,On the gliding stream
11506,THE WINDMILL,Writes her scattered dream:
11507,THE WINDMILL,
11508,THE WINDMILL,"Angel spirits of sleep,"
11509,THE WINDMILL,Dancing to the weir
11510,THE WINDMILL,In the hollow roar
11511,THE WINDMILL,Of its waters deep;
11512,THE WINDMILL,Know ye how men say
11513,THE WINDMILL,That ye haunt no more
11514,THE WINDMILL,Isle and grassy shore
11515,THE WINDMILL,With your moonlit play;
11516,THE WINDMILL,"That ye dance not here,"
11517,THE WINDMILL,"White-robed spirits of sleep,"
11518,THE WINDMILL,All the summer night
11519,THE WINDMILL,Threading dances light?

11529,ANNIVERSARY,"Fairer and purer than winter snow,"
11530,ANNIVERSARY,Frolic as are the morns of May?
11531,ANNIVERSARY,--If it should be what best I know!
11532,ANNIVERSARY,
11533,ANNIVERSARY,What is richer than thoughts that stray
11534,ANNIVERSARY,From reading of poems that smoothly flow?
11535,ANNIVERSARY,What is solemn like the delay
11536,ANNIVERSARY,Of concords linked in a music slow
11537,ANNIVERSARY,Dying thro' vaulted aisles away?
11538,ANNIVERSARY,--If it should be what best I know!
11539,ANNIVERSARY,
11540,ANNIVERSARY,"What gives faith to me when I pray,"
11541,ANNIVERSARY,"Setteth my heart with joy aglow,"
11542,ANNIVERSARY,"Filleth my song with fancies gay,"
11543,ANNIVERSARY,"Maketh the heaven to which I go,"
11544,ANNIVERSARY,The gladness of earth that lasteth for aye?
11545,ANNIVERSARY,--If it should be what best I know!
11546,ANNIVERSARY,
11547,ANNIVERSARY,But tell me thou--'twas on this day
11548,ANNIVERSARY,That first we loved five years ago--
11549,ANNIVERSARY,"If 'tis a thing that I can say,"

11558,ANNIVERSARY,Across the country side.
11559,ANNIVERSARY,
11560,ANNIVERSARY,His scourge of fury is lashing down
11561,ANNIVERSARY,"The delicate-rankÃ¨d golden corn,"
11562,ANNIVERSARY,That never more shall rear its crown
11563,ANNIVERSARY,And curtsey to the morn.
11564,ANNIVERSARY,
11565,ANNIVERSARY,There shews no care in heaven to save
11566,ANNIVERSARY,"Man's pitiful patience, or provide"
11567,ANNIVERSARY,"A season for the season's slave,"
11568,ANNIVERSARY,Whose trust hath toiled and died.
11569,ANNIVERSARY,
11570,ANNIVERSARY,"So my proud spirit in me is sad,"
11571,ANNIVERSARY,"A wreck of fairer fields to mourn,"

11581,ANNIVERSARY,Of budding May's rejoicing train.
11582,ANNIVERSARY,
11583,ANNIVERSARY,"Like autumn flowers that brave the frost,"
11584,ANNIVERSARY,"And make their show when hope is lost,"
11585,ANNIVERSARY,These 'mong the fruits and mellow scent
11586,ANNIVERSARY,Mourn not the high-sunned summer spent.
11587,ANNIVERSARY,
11588,ANNIVERSARY,Their notes thro' all the jocund spring
11589,ANNIVERSARY,Were mixed in merry musicking:
11590,ANNIVERSARY,"They sang for love the whole day long,"
11591,ANNIVERSARY,But now their love is all for song.
11592,ANNIVERSARY,
11593,ANNIVERSARY,Now each hath perfected his lay
11594,ANNIVERSARY,To praise the year that hastes away:
11595,ANNIVERSARY,"They sit on boughs apart, and vie"
11596,ANNIVERSARY,In single songs and rich reply:
11597,ANNIVERSARY,
11598,ANNIVERSARY,And oft as in the copse I hear
11599,ANNIVERSARY,"These anthems of the dying year,"
11600,ANNIVERSARY,"The passions, once her peace that stole,"
11601,ANNIVERSARY,With flattering love my heart console.

11605,ANNIVERSARY,
11606,ANNIVERSARY,"When my love was away,"
11607,ANNIVERSARY,"Full three days were not sped,"
11608,ANNIVERSARY,I caught my fancy astray
11609,ANNIVERSARY,"Thinking if she were dead,"
11610,ANNIVERSARY,
11611,ANNIVERSARY,"And I alone, alone:"
11612,ANNIVERSARY,It seemed in my misery
11613,ANNIVERSARY,In all the world was none
11614,ANNIVERSARY,Ever so lone as I.
11615,ANNIVERSARY,
11616,ANNIVERSARY,I wept; but it did not shame
11617,ANNIVERSARY,Nor comfort my heart: away
11618,ANNIVERSARY,"I rode as I might, and came"
11619,ANNIVERSARY,To my love at close of day.
11620,ANNIVERSARY,
11621,ANNIVERSARY,"The sight of her stilled my fears,"
11622,ANNIVERSARY,My fairest-hearted love:
11623,ANNIVERSARY,And yet in her eyes were tears:
11624,ANNIVERSARY,"Which when I questioned of,"
11625,ANNIVERSARY,
11626,ANNIVERSARY,"O now thou art come, she cried,"
11627,ANNIVERSARY,'Tis fled: but I thought to-day

11635,ANNIVERSARY,"The tyrannous wind, its strength fordone,"
11636,ANNIVERSARY,Is fallen back in the west
11637,ANNIVERSARY,To couch with the sinking sun.
11638,ANNIVERSARY,The last clouds fare
11639,ANNIVERSARY,"With fainting speed, and their thin streamers fly"
11640,ANNIVERSARY,In melting drifts of the sky.
11641,ANNIVERSARY,Already the birds in the air
11642,ANNIVERSARY,"Appear again; the rooks return to their haunt,"
11643,ANNIVERSARY,"And one by one,"
11644,ANNIVERSARY,"Proclaiming aloud their care,"
11645,ANNIVERSARY,Renew their peaceful chant.
11646,ANNIVERSARY,
11647,ANNIVERSARY,"Torn and shattered the trees their branches again reset,"
11648,ANNIVERSARY,They trim afresh the fair
11649,ANNIVERSARY,"Few green and golden leaves withheld from the storm,"
11650,ANNIVERSARY,And awhile will be handsome yet.
11651,ANNIVERSARY,To-morrow's sun shall caress
11652,ANNIVERSARY,Their remnant of loveliness:
11653,ANNIVERSARY,In quiet days for a time
11654,ANNIVERSARY,Sad Autumn lingering warm
11655,ANNIVERSARY,Shall humour their faded prime.
11656,ANNIVERSARY,
11657,ANNIVERSARY,But ah! the leaves of summer that lie on the ground!
11658,ANNIVERSARY,"What havoc! The laughing timbrels of June,"
11659,ANNIVERSARY,"That curtained the birds' cradles, and screened their song,"
11660,ANNIVERSARY,"That sheltered the cooing doves at noon,"
11661,ANNIVERSARY,"Of airy fans the delicate throng,--"
11662,ANNIVERSARY,Torn and scattered around:
11663,ANNIVERSARY,"Far out afield they lie,"
11664,ANNIVERSARY,"In the watery furrows die,"
11665,ANNIVERSARY,"In grassy pools of the flood they sink and drown,"
11666,ANNIVERSARY,"Green-golden, orange, vermilion, golden and brown,"
11667,ANNIVERSARY,The high year's flaunting crown
11668,ANNIVERSARY,Shattered and trampled down.
11669,ANNIVERSARY,
11670,ANNIVERSARY,The day is done: the tired land looks for night:
11671,ANNIVERSARY,She prays to the night to keep
11672,ANNIVERSARY,In peace her nerves of delight:
11673,ANNIVERSARY,"While silver mist upstealeth silently,"
11674,ANNIVERSARY,And the broad cloud driving moon in the clear sky
11675,ANNIVERSARY,"Lifts o'er the firs her shining shield,"
11676,ANNIVERSARY,And in her tranquil light
11677,ANNIVERSARY,Sleep falls on forest and field.
11678,ANNIVERSARY,SÃ©e! slÃ©ep hath fallen: the trees are asleep:
11679,ANNIVERSARY,The night is come. The land is wrapt in sleep.
11680,ANNIVERSARY,
11681,ANNIVERSARY,
11682,ANNIVERSARY,24
11683,ANNIVERSARY,
11684,ANNIVERSARY,"Ye thrilled me once, ye mournful strains,"
11685,ANNIVERSARY,"Ye anthems of plaintive woe,"
11686,ANNIVERSARY,My spirit was sad when I was young;
11687,ANNIVERSARY,Ah sorrowful long-ago!
11688,ANNIVERSARY,But since I have found the beauty of joy
11689,ANNIVERSARY,I have done with proud dismay:
11690,ANNIVERSARY,For howsoe'er man hug his care
11691,ANNIVERSARY,The best of his art is gay.
11692,ANNIVERSARY,
11693,ANNIVERSARY,And yet if voices of fancy's choir
11694,ANNIVERSARY,Again in mine ear awake
11695,ANNIVERSARY,"Your old lament, 'tis dear to me still,"
11696,ANNIVERSARY,Nor all for memory's sake:
11697,ANNIVERSARY,"'Tis like the dirge of sorrow dead,"
11698,ANNIVERSARY,Whose tears are wiped away;
11699,ANNIVERSARY,"Or drops of the shower when rain is o'er,"
11700,ANNIVERSARY,That jewel the brightened day.
11701,ANNIVERSARY,
11702,ANNIVERSARY,
11703,ANNIVERSARY,25
11704,ANNIVERSARY,
11705,ANNIVERSARY,"Say who is this with silvered hair,"
11706,ANNIVERSARY,"So pale and worn and thin,"
11707,ANNIVERSARY,"Who passeth here, and passeth there,"
11708,ANNIVERSARY,And looketh out and in?
11709,ANNIVERSARY,
11710,ANNIVERSARY,That useth not our garb nor tongue
11711,ANNIVERSARY,And knoweth things untold:
11712,ANNIVERSARY,"Who teacheth pleasure to the young,"
11713,ANNIVERSARY,And wisdom to the old?
11714,ANNIVERSARY,
11715,ANNIVERSARY,"No toil he maketh his by day,"
11716,ANNIVERSARY,No home his own by night;
11717,ANNIVERSARY,"But wheresoe'er he take his way,"
11718,ANNIVERSARY,He killeth our delight.
11719,ANNIVERSARY,
11720,ANNIVERSARY,Since he is come there's nothing wise
11721,ANNIVERSARY,"Nor fair in man or child,"
11722,ANNIVERSARY,Unless his deep divining eyes
11723,ANNIVERSARY,Have looked on it and smiled.
11724,ANNIVERSARY,
11725,ANNIVERSARY,Whence came he hither all alone
11726,ANNIVERSARY,Among our folk to spy?
11727,ANNIVERSARY,"There's nought that we can call our own,"
11728,ANNIVERSARY,Till he shall hap to die.
11729,ANNIVERSARY,
11730,ANNIVERSARY,And I would dig his grave full deep
11731,ANNIVERSARY,"Beneath the churchyard yew,"
11732,ANNIVERSARY,Lest thence his wizard eyes might peep
11733,ANNIVERSARY,To mark the things we do.
11734,ANNIVERSARY,
11735,ANNIVERSARY,
11736,ANNIVERSARY,26
11737,ANNIVERSARY,
11738,ANNIVERSARY,"Crown Winter with green,"
11739,ANNIVERSARY,And give him good drink
11740,ANNIVERSARY,To physic his spleen
11741,ANNIVERSARY,Or ever he think.
11742,ANNIVERSARY,
11743,ANNIVERSARY,"His mouth to the bowl,"
11744,ANNIVERSARY,His feet to the fire;
11745,ANNIVERSARY,"And let him, good soul,"
11746,ANNIVERSARY,No comfort desire.
11747,ANNIVERSARY,
11748,ANNIVERSARY,"So merry he be,"
11749,ANNIVERSARY,I bid him abide:
11750,ANNIVERSARY,And merry be we
11751,ANNIVERSARY,This good Yuletide.

11753,ANNIVERSARY,
11754,ANNIVERSARY,27
11755,ANNIVERSARY,
11756,ANNIVERSARY,"The snow lies sprinkled on the beach,"
11757,ANNIVERSARY,And whitens all the marshy lea:
11758,ANNIVERSARY,"The sad gulls wail adown the gale,"
11759,ANNIVERSARY,The day is dark and black the sea.
11760,ANNIVERSARY,Shorn of their crests the blighted waves
11761,ANNIVERSARY,With driven foam the offing fleck:
11762,ANNIVERSARY,The ebb is low and barely laves
11763,ANNIVERSARY,The red rust of the giant wreck.
11764,ANNIVERSARY,
11765,ANNIVERSARY,"On such a stony, breaking beach"
11766,ANNIVERSARY,My childhood chanced and chose to be:
11767,ANNIVERSARY,"'Twas here I played, and musing made"
11768,ANNIVERSARY,My friend the melancholy sea.
11769,ANNIVERSARY,He from his dim enchanted caves
11770,ANNIVERSARY,With shuddering roar and onrush wild
11771,ANNIVERSARY,Fell down in sacrificial waves
11772,ANNIVERSARY,At feet of his exulting child.
11773,ANNIVERSARY,
11774,ANNIVERSARY,Unto a spirit too light for fear
11775,ANNIVERSARY,"His wrath was mirth, his wail was glee:--"
11776,ANNIVERSARY,My heart is now too fixed to bow
11777,ANNIVERSARY,Tho' all his tempests howl at me:
11778,ANNIVERSARY,"For to the gain life's summer saves,"
11779,ANNIVERSARY,"My solemn joy's increasing store,"
11780,ANNIVERSARY,The tossing of his mournful waves
11781,ANNIVERSARY,Makes sweetest music evermore.

11783,ANNIVERSARY,
11784,ANNIVERSARY,28
11785,ANNIVERSARY,
11786,ANNIVERSARY,"My spirit kisseth thine,"
11787,ANNIVERSARY,My spirit embraceth thee:
11788,ANNIVERSARY,I feel thy being twine
11789,ANNIVERSARY,"Her graces over me,"
11790,ANNIVERSARY,In the life-kindling fold
11791,ANNIVERSARY,"Of God's breath; where on high,"
11792,ANNIVERSARY,In furthest space untold
11793,ANNIVERSARY,Like a lost world I lie:
11794,ANNIVERSARY,
11795,ANNIVERSARY,And o'er my dreaming plains
11796,ANNIVERSARY,"Lightens, most pale and fair,"
11797,ANNIVERSARY,A moon that never wanes;
11798,ANNIVERSARY,"Or more, if I compare,"
11799,ANNIVERSARY,
11800,ANNIVERSARY,Like what the shepherd sees
11801,ANNIVERSARY,"On late mid-winter dawns,"
11802,ANNIVERSARY,"When thro' the branchÃ¨d trees,"
11803,ANNIVERSARY,"O'er the white-frosted lawns,"
11804,ANNIVERSARY,
11805,ANNIVERSARY,"The huge unclouded sun,"
11806,ANNIVERSARY,"Surprising the world whist,"

11815,ANNIVERSARY,Beyond my spirit's dominion?
11816,ANNIVERSARY,"That makest my heart run over with rhyme,"
11817,ANNIVERSARY,"Renewing at will my youth for a time,"
11818,ANNIVERSARY,"My servant, my pretty minion."
11819,ANNIVERSARY,
11820,ANNIVERSARY,"Now indeed I have cause to mourn,"
11821,ANNIVERSARY,Now thou returnest scorn for scorn:

11824,ANNIVERSARY,"As I, and none when thou'rt away"

11853,THE WINNOWERS,Betwixt two billows of the downs
11854,THE WINNOWERS,"The little hamlet lies,"
11855,THE WINNOWERS,And nothing sees but the bald crowns
11856,THE WINNOWERS,"Of the hills, and the blue skies."
11857,THE WINNOWERS,
11858,THE WINNOWERS,Clustering beneath the long descent
11859,THE WINNOWERS,"And grey slopes of the wold,"
11860,THE WINNOWERS,"The red roofs nestle, oversprent"
11861,THE WINNOWERS,With lichen yellow as gold.
11862,THE WINNOWERS,
11863,THE WINNOWERS,We found it in the mid-day sun
11864,THE WINNOWERS,"Basking, what time of year"
11865,THE WINNOWERS,"The thrush his singing has begun,"
11866,THE WINNOWERS,Ere the first leaves appear.
11867,THE WINNOWERS,
11868,THE WINNOWERS,High from his load a woodman pitched
11869,THE WINNOWERS,His faggots on the stack:
11870,THE WINNOWERS,Knee-deep in straw the cattle twitched
11871,THE WINNOWERS,Sweet hay from crib and rack:
11872,THE WINNOWERS,
11873,THE WINNOWERS,And from the barn hard by was borne
11874,THE WINNOWERS,"A steady muffled din,"
11875,THE WINNOWERS,By which we knew that threshÃ¨d corn
11876,THE WINNOWERS,"Was winnowing, and went in."
11877,THE WINNOWERS,
11878,THE WINNOWERS,The sunbeams on the motey air
11879,THE WINNOWERS,"Streamed through the open door,"
11880,THE WINNOWERS,"And on the brown arms moving bare,"
11881,THE WINNOWERS,And the grain upon the floor.
11882,THE WINNOWERS,
11883,THE WINNOWERS,"One turns the crank, one stoops to feed"
11884,THE WINNOWERS,"The hopper, lest it lack,"
11885,THE WINNOWERS,"One in the bushel scoops the seed,"
11886,THE WINNOWERS,One stands to hold the sack.
11887,THE WINNOWERS,
11888,THE WINNOWERS,"We watched the good grain rattle down,"
11889,THE WINNOWERS,And the awns fly in the draught;
11890,THE WINNOWERS,To see us both so pensive grown
11891,THE WINNOWERS,The honest labourers laughed:
11892,THE WINNOWERS,
11893,THE WINNOWERS,"Merry they were, because the wheat"
11894,THE WINNOWERS,"Was clean and plump and good,"
11895,THE WINNOWERS,"Pleasant to hand and eye, and meet"
11896,THE WINNOWERS,For market and for food.
11897,THE WINNOWERS,
11898,THE WINNOWERS,"It chanced we from the city were,"
11899,THE WINNOWERS,And had not gat us free
11900,THE WINNOWERS,In spirit from the store and stir
11901,THE WINNOWERS,Of its immensity:

11961,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of high-grown hollyhocks, and all tall shows"
11962,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,That Autumn flaunteth in his bushy bowers;
11963,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Where tomtits, hanging from the drooping heads"

11967,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,Till thousand stars leap with their visiting:
11968,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"While ever across the path mazily flit,"
11969,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Unpiloted in the sun,"
11970,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,The dreamy butterflies
11971,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"With dazzling colours powdered and soft glooms,"
11972,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"White, black and crimson stripes, and peacock eyes,"

11978,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Into the garden saileth,"
11979,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Scarce here and there stirring the single trees,"
11980,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,For his sharpness he vaileth:
11981,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"So long a comrade of the bearded corn,"
11982,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Now from the stubbles whence the shocks are borne,"
11983,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"O'er dewy lawns he turns to stray,"
11984,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,As mindful of the kisses and soft play
11985,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Wherewith he enamoured the light-hearted May,"
11986,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,Ere he deserted her;
11987,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Lover of fragrance, and too late repents;"
11988,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Nor more of heavy hyacinth now may drink,"
11989,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Nor spicy pink,"
11990,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Nor summer's rose, nor garnered lavender,"
11991,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,But the few lingering scents
11992,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of streakÃ¨d pea, and gillyflower, and stocks"
11993,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of courtly purple, and aromatic phlox."
11994,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,
11995,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,And at all times to hear are drowsy tones
11996,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of dizzy flies, and humming drones,"

12000,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"The distant blue, to watering as they fare"
12001,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"With creaking pinions, or--on business bent,"

12154,A ROBIN,"Of the leafless oak, what singest thou?"
12155,A ROBIN,Hark! he telleth how--
12156,A ROBIN,'Spring is coming now; Spring is coming now.
12157,A ROBIN,
12158,A ROBIN,"Now ruddy are the elm-tops against the blue sky,"
12159,A ROBIN,The pale larch donneth her jewelry;
12160,A ROBIN,"Red fir and black fir sigh,"
12161,A ROBIN,And I am lamenting the year gone by.
12162,A ROBIN,
12163,A ROBIN,"The bushes where I nested are all cut down,"
12164,A ROBIN,"They are felling the tall trees one by one,"
12165,A ROBIN,"And my mate is dead and gone,"
12166,A ROBIN,In the winter she died and left me lone.
12167,A ROBIN,
12168,A ROBIN,She lay in the thicket where I fear to go;
12169,A ROBIN,For when the March-winds after the snow
12170,A ROBIN,"The leaves away did blow,"
12171,A ROBIN,"She was not there, and my heart is woe:"
12172,A ROBIN,
12173,A ROBIN,"And sad is my song, when I begin to sing,"
12174,A ROBIN,As I sit in the sunshine this merry spring:
12175,A ROBIN,Like a withered leaf I cling
12176,A ROBIN,"To the white oak-bough, while the wood doth ring."
12177,A ROBIN,
12178,A ROBIN,"Spring is coming now, the sun again is gay;"
12179,A ROBIN,Each day like a last spring's happy day.'--

12188,A ROBIN,With corniced drift it blocked the lane
12189,A ROBIN,And sheeted in a desolate plain
12190,A ROBIN,The country side.
12191,A ROBIN,
12192,A ROBIN,The trees with silvery rime bedight
12193,A ROBIN,Their branches bare.
12194,A ROBIN,By day no sun appeared; by night
12195,A ROBIN,The hidden moon shed thievish light
12196,A ROBIN,In the misty air.
12197,A ROBIN,
12198,A ROBIN,We fed the birds that flew around
12199,A ROBIN,In flocks to be fed:
12200,A ROBIN,No shelter in holly or brake they found.
12201,A ROBIN,The speckled thrush on the frozen ground
12202,A ROBIN,Lay frozen and dead.
12203,A ROBIN,
12204,A ROBIN,We skated on stream and pond; we cut
12205,A ROBIN,The crinching snow
12206,A ROBIN,To Doric temple or Arctic hut;
12207,A ROBIN,"We laughed and sang at nightfall, shut"
12208,A ROBIN,By the fireside glow.
12209,A ROBIN,
12210,A ROBIN,Yet grudged we our keen delights before
12211,A ROBIN,Maurice should come.
12212,A ROBIN,"We said, In-door or out-of-door"
12213,A ROBIN,"We shall love life for a month or more,"
12214,A ROBIN,When he is home.
12215,A ROBIN,
12216,A ROBIN,They brought him home; 'twas two days late
12217,A ROBIN,For Christmas day:
12218,A ROBIN,"Wrapped in white, in solemn state,"
12219,A ROBIN,"A flower in his hand, all still and straight"
12220,A ROBIN,Our Maurice lay.
12221,A ROBIN,
12222,A ROBIN,And two days ere the year outgave
12223,A ROBIN,We laid him low.
12224,A ROBIN,"The best of us truly were not brave,"
12225,A ROBIN,When we laid Maurice down in his grave
12226,A ROBIN,Under the snow.

12534,A VILLAGER,The day that he came to father's house:
12535,A VILLAGER,There was none had an eye as soft an' blue
12536,A VILLAGER,"As Willie's was, when he came to woo."
12537,A VILLAGER,
12538,A VILLAGER,"To a labouring life though bound thee be,"

12543,A VILLAGER,'Tis forty years now since we were wed:
12544,A VILLAGER,We are ailing an' grey needs not to be said:
12545,A VILLAGER,But Willie's eye is as blue an' soft
12546,A VILLAGER,As the day when he wooed me in father's croft.
12547,A VILLAGER,
12548,A VILLAGER,"Yet changed am I in body an' mind,"
12549,A VILLAGER,For Willie to me has ne'er been kind:
12550,A VILLAGER,Merrily drinking an' singing with the men
12551,A VILLAGER,He 'ud come home late six nights o' the se'n.
12552,A VILLAGER,
12553,A VILLAGER,An' since the children be grown an' gone
12554,A VILLAGER,He 'as shunned the house an' left me lone:
12555,A VILLAGER,An' less an' less he brings me in
12556,A VILLAGER,Of the little he now has strength to win.
12557,A VILLAGER,
12558,A VILLAGER,"The roof lets through the wind an' the wet,"
12559,A VILLAGER,An' master won't mend it with us in 's debt:

12562,A VILLAGER,
12563,A VILLAGER,No wonder if words hav' a-grown to blows;
12564,A VILLAGER,That matters not while nobody knows:

12622,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Nor e'er was such transcendent love more fond
12623,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Than that which Edward unto Basil led,"
12624,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Wandering alone across the woody shires
12625,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"To hear the living voice of that wide heart,"
12626,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"To see the eyes that read the world's desires,"
12627,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,And touch the hand that wrote the roving rhyme.

12635,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Where the far sea gleam'd o'er the bosky combes,"
12636,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Satisfying their spirits the livelong day
12637,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,With various mirth and revelation due
12638,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"And delicate intimacy of delight,"
12639,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,As there in happy indolence they lay
12640,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"And drank the sun, while round the breezy height"
12641,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Beneath their feet rabbit and listless ewe
12642,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Nibbled the scented herb and grass at will.
12643,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,

12645,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Spoke Edward thus, ''Twas on this very hill"
12646,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"This time of the year,--but now twelve years are past,--"
12647,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,That you provoked in verse my younger skill
12648,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,To praise the months against your rival song;
12649,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,And ere the sun had westered ten degrees
12650,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Our rhyme had brought him thro' the Zodiac.
12651,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Have you remembered?'--Basil answer'd back,"
12652,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"'Guest of my solace, how could I forget?"
12653,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Years fly as months that seem'd in youth so long.
12654,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"The precious life that, like indifferent gold,"
12655,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Is disregarded in its worth to hold
12656,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Some jewel of love that God therein would set,"
12657,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"It passeth and is gone.'--'And yet not all,'"
12658,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Edward replied: 'The passion as I please
12659,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Of that past day I can to-day recall;
12660,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"And if but you, as I, remember yet"
12661,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Your part thereof, and will again rehearse,"
12662,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,For half an hour we may old Time outwit.'
12663,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"And Basil said, 'Alas for my poor verse!"
12664,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,What happy memory of it still endures
12665,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,Will thank your love: I have forgotten it.
12666,_BASIL AND EDWARD_,"Speak you my stanzas, I will ransom yours."

12923,RICHARD,Beneath the wattled bank the eddies swarm
12924,RICHARD,In wandering dimples o'er the shady pool:
12925,RICHARD,The same their chase as when I was at school;
12926,RICHARD,"The same the music, where in shallows warm"
12927,RICHARD,"The current, sunder'd by the bushy isles,"
12928,RICHARD,"Returns to join the main, and struggles free"
12929,RICHARD,"Above the willows, gurgling thro' the piles:"
12930,RICHARD,"Nothing is changed, and yet how changed are we!"
12931,RICHARD,--What can bring Godfrey to the Muses' bower?

12935,GODFREY,What but brings you? The festal day of the year;

12969,RICHARD,For Fancy cannot live on real food:
12970,RICHARD,In youth she will despise familiar joy
12971,RICHARD,"To dwell in mournful shades; as they grow real,"
12972,RICHARD,Then buildeth she of joy her far ideal.

12978,GODFREY,The water saith 'Ah me! where have I lept?
12979,GODFREY,"Into what garden of life? what banks are these,"
12980,GODFREY,"What secret lawns, what ancient towers and trees?"
12981,GODFREY,"Where the young sons of heav'n, with shouts of play"
12982,GODFREY,"Or low delighted speech, welcome the day,"
12983,GODFREY,As if the poetry of the earth had slept
12984,GODFREY,To wake in ecstasy. O stay me! alas!
12985,GODFREY,"Stay me, ye happy isles, ere that I pass"
12986,GODFREY,Without a memory on my sullen course

13025,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,How well my eyes remember the dim path!
13026,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,My homing heart no happier playground hath.
13027,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,I need not close my lids but it appears
13028,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Through the bewilderment of forty years
13029,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"To tempt my feet, my childish feet, between"
13030,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Its leafy walls, beneath its arching green;"
13031,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Fairer than dream of sleep, than Hope more fair"
13032,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Leading to dreamless sleep her sister Care.
13033,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13034,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"There grew two fellow limes, two rising trees,"
13035,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Shadowing the lawn, the summer haunt of bees,"
13036,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Whose stems, engraved with many a russet scar"
13037,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"From the spear-hurlings of our mimic war,"
13038,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Pillar'd the portico to that wide walk,"
13039,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,A mossy terrace of the native chalk
13040,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Fashion'd, that led thro' the dark shades around"
13041,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Straight to the wooden temple on the mound.
13042,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"There live the memories of my early days,"
13043,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,There still with childish heart my spirit plays;
13044,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Yea, terror-stricken by the fiend despair"
13045,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"When she hath fled me, I have found her there;"
13046,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"And there 'tis ever noon, and glad suns bring"
13047,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Alternate days of summer and of spring,"
13048,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"With childish thought, and childish faces bright,"
13049,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And all unknown save but the hour's delight.
13050,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13051,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"High on the mound the ivied arbour stood,"
13052,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,A dome of straw upheld on rustic wood:
13053,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Hidden in fern the steps of the ascent,"
13054,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Whereby unto the southern front we went,"
13055,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"And from the dark plantation climbing free,"
13056,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Over a valley look'd out on the sea.
13057,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"That sea is ever bright and blue, the sky"
13058,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Serene and blue, and ever white ships lie"
13059,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"High on the horizon steadfast in full sail,"
13060,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Or nearer in the roads pass within hail,"
13061,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Of naked brigs and barques that windbound ride
13062,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,At their taut cables heading to the tide.
13063,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13064,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"There many an hour I have sat to watch; nay, now"
13065,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The brazen disk is cold against my brow,"
13066,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And in my sight a circle of the sea
13067,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Enlarged to swiftness, where the salt waves flee,"
13068,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And ships in stately motion pass so near
13069,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,That what I see is speaking to my ear:
13070,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"I hear the waves dash and the tackle strain,"
13071,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The canvas flap, the rattle of the chain"
13072,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"That runs out thro' the hawse, the clank of the winch"
13073,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Winding the rusty cable inch by inch,"

13077,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,On every petty task of their rough lot
13078,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Prying and spying, searching every craft"
13079,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"From painted truck to gunnel, fore and aft,--"
13080,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Thro' idle Sundays as I have watch'd them lean
13081,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Long hours upon the rail, or neath its screen"
13082,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Prone on the deck to lie outstretch'd at length,"
13083,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Sunk in renewal of their wearied strength.
13084,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13085,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But what a feast of joy to me, if some"
13086,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Fast-sailing frigate to the Channel come
13087,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Back'd here her topsail, or brought gently up"
13088,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Let from her bow the splashing anchor drop,"
13089,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"By faint contrary wind stay'd in her cruise,"
13090,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The _Phaethon_ or dancing _Arethuse_,"
13091,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Or some immense three-decker of the line,"
13092,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Romantic as the tale of Troy divine;
13093,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Ere yet our iron age had doom'd to fall
13094,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The towering freeboard of the wooden wall,"
13095,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And for the engines of a mightier Mars
13096,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Clipp'd their wide wings, and dock'd their soaring spars."
13097,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The gale that in their tackle sang, the wave"
13098,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,That neath their gilded galleries dasht so brave
13099,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Lost then their merriment, nor look to play"
13100,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,With the heavy-hearted monsters of to-day.
13101,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13102,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,One noon in March upon that anchoring ground
13103,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Came Napier's fleet unto the Baltic bound:
13104,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Cloudless the sky and calm and blue the sea,"
13105,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"As round Saint Margaret's cliff mysteriously,"
13106,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Those murderous queens walking in Sabbath sleep
13107,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Glided in line upon the windless deep:
13108,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,For in those days was first seen low and black
13109,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Beside the full-rigg'd mast the strange smoke-stack,"
13110,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And neath their stern revolv'd the twisted fan.
13111,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Many I knew as soon as I might scan,"
13112,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The heavy _Royal George_, the _Acre_ bright,"
13113,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The _Hogue_ and _Ajax_, and could name aright"
13114,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Others that I remember now no more;
13115,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But chief, her blue flag flying at the fore,"
13116,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"With fighting guns a hundred thirty and one,"
13117,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The Admiral ship _The Duke of Wellington_,"
13118,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Whereon sail'd George, who in her gig had flown"
13119,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,The silken ensign by our sisters sewn.
13120,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The iron Duke himself,--whose soldier fame"
13121,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"To England's proudest ship had given her name,"
13122,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And whose white hairs in this my earliest scene
13123,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Had scarce more honour'd than accustom'd been,--"
13124,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Was two years since to his last haven past:
13125,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,I had seen his castle-flag to fall half-mast
13126,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"One morn as I sat looking on the sea,"
13127,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"When thus all England's grief came first to me,"
13128,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Who hold my childhood favour'd that I knew
13129,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,So well the face that won at Waterloo.
13130,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13131,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But now 'tis other wars, and other men;--"
13132,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The year that Napier sail'd, my years were ten--"
13133,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Yea, and new homes and loves my heart hath found:"
13134,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"A priest has there usurped the ivied mound,"
13135,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The bell that call'd to horse calls now to prayers,"
13136,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And silent nuns tread the familiar stairs.
13137,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Within the peach-clad walls that old outlaw,"
13138,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The Roman wolf, scratches with privy paw."

13145,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Because thou dost soften
13146,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,My being to pain:
13147,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13148,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Thou makest me fear
13149,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The mind that createth,"
13150,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,That loves not nor hateth
13151,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,In justice austere;
13152,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Who, ere he make one,"
13153,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"With millions toyeth,"

13158,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"My glorious passion,"

13160,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"To sternness, as he."
13161,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13162,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But thee, Love, he made"

13164,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Connive and outvie him,"
13165,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And not be afraid:
13166,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
13167,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Nay, thee, Love, he gave"
13168,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"His terrors to cover,"

13180,THE SOUTH WIND,"And it now reach'd even to me, at dusk of the day,"
13181,THE SOUTH WIND,And moan'd in the branches aloud:
13182,THE SOUTH WIND,"While here and there, in patches of dark space,"
13183,THE SOUTH WIND,"A star shone forth from its heavenly place,"
13184,THE SOUTH WIND,As a spark that is borne in the smoky chase;
13185,THE SOUTH WIND,"And, looking up, there fell on my face--"
13186,THE SOUTH WIND,Could it be drops of rain
13187,THE SOUTH WIND,"Soft as the wind, that fell on my face?"
13188,THE SOUTH WIND,"Gossamers light as threads of the summer dawn,"
13189,THE SOUTH WIND,"Suck'd by the sun from midmost calms of the main,"
13190,THE SOUTH WIND,"From groves of coral islands secretly drawn,"
13191,THE SOUTH WIND,"O'er half the round of earth to be driven,"
13192,THE SOUTH WIND,Now to fall on my face
13193,THE SOUTH WIND,In silky skeins spun from the mists of heaven.
13194,THE SOUTH WIND,
13195,THE SOUTH WIND,"Who art thou, in wind and darkness and soft rain"
13196,THE SOUTH WIND,"Thyself that robest, that bendest in sighing pines"
13197,THE SOUTH WIND,To whisper thy truth? that usest for signs
13198,THE SOUTH WIND,"A hurried glimpse of the moon, the glance of a star"
13199,THE SOUTH WIND,In the rifted sky?
13200,THE SOUTH WIND,"Who art thou, that with thee I"

13203,THE SOUTH WIND,"Choosest my chosen solitude,"
13204,THE SOUTH WIND,Coming so far
13205,THE SOUTH WIND,"To tell thy secret again,"
13206,THE SOUTH WIND,"As a mother her child, in her folding arm"
13207,THE SOUTH WIND,"Of a winter night by a flickering fire,"
13208,THE SOUTH WIND,Telleth the same tale o'er and o'er
13209,THE SOUTH WIND,"With gentle voice, and I never tire,"
13210,THE SOUTH WIND,"So imperceptibly changeth the charm,"
13211,THE SOUTH WIND,"As Love on buried ecstasy buildeth his tower,"
13212,THE SOUTH WIND,--Like as the stem that beareth the flower
13213,THE SOUTH WIND,By trembling is knit to power;--
13214,THE SOUTH WIND,Ah! long ago
13215,THE SOUTH WIND,"In thy first rapture I renounced my lot,"
13216,THE SOUTH WIND,"The vanity, the despondency and the woe,"
13217,THE SOUTH WIND,And seeking thee to know
13218,THE SOUTH WIND,"Well was 't for me, and evermore"
13219,THE SOUTH WIND,"I am thine, I know not what."
13220,THE SOUTH WIND,
13221,THE SOUTH WIND,"For me thou seekest ever, me wondering a day"
13222,THE SOUTH WIND,"In the eternal alternations, me"
13223,THE SOUTH WIND,Free for a stolen moment of chance
13224,THE SOUTH WIND,To dream a beautiful dream
13225,THE SOUTH WIND,In the everlasting dance
13226,THE SOUTH WIND,"Of speechless worlds, the unsearchable scheme,"
13227,THE SOUTH WIND,"To me thou findest the way,"
13228,THE SOUTH WIND,Me and whomsoe'er
13229,THE SOUTH WIND,I have found my dream to share
13230,THE SOUTH WIND,Still with thy charm encircling; even to-night
13231,THE SOUTH WIND,To me and my love in darkness and soft rain
13232,THE SOUTH WIND,"Under the sighing pines thou comest again,"
13233,THE SOUTH WIND,"And staying our speech with mystery of delight,"
13234,THE SOUTH WIND,"Of the kiss that I give a wonder thou makest,"
13235,THE SOUTH WIND,And the kiss that I take thou takest.

13244,THE SOUTH WIND,In GoddÃ«s work her spirit readeth.
13245,THE SOUTH WIND,
13246,THE SOUTH WIND,"She is all to me, and I to her:"
13247,THE SOUTH WIND,"When we embrace, the stars confer."
13248,THE SOUTH WIND,
13249,THE SOUTH WIND,"O my love, from beyond the sky"

13261,THE SOUTH WIND,"In search of wisdom, had less of truth."
13262,THE SOUTH WIND,
13263,THE SOUTH WIND,Flame of fire was the poet's desire:
13264,THE SOUTH WIND,The thinker found that life was fire.
13265,THE SOUTH WIND,
13266,THE SOUTH WIND,O my love! my song is done:

13275,THE SOUTH WIND,
13276,THE SOUTH WIND,"When in her ear the secret I tell,"
13277,THE SOUTH WIND,She smileth with joy incredible--
13278,THE SOUTH WIND,
13279,THE SOUTH WIND,Ha! she is vain--O nay--
13280,THE SOUTH WIND,"Then tell us!--Nay, O nay."
13281,THE SOUTH WIND,
13282,THE SOUTH WIND,"But this is in my heart,"
13283,THE SOUTH WIND,"That Love is Nature's perfect art,"
13284,THE SOUTH WIND,"And man hath got his fancy hence,"

13419,SEPTUAGESIMA,Deep in the sunny vale a burn
13420,SEPTUAGESIMA,"Ran with the lane,"
13421,SEPTUAGESIMA,"O'erhung with ivy, moss and fern"
13422,SEPTUAGESIMA,It laughed in joyful strain:
13423,SEPTUAGESIMA,

13425,SEPTUAGESIMA,Their cluster'd cream;
13426,SEPTUAGESIMA,Robin and wren and amorous thrush
13427,SEPTUAGESIMA,Carol'd above the stream:
13428,SEPTUAGESIMA,
13429,SEPTUAGESIMA,The stillness of the lenten air
13430,SEPTUAGESIMA,Call'd into sound
13431,SEPTUAGESIMA,The motions of all life that were

13877,DUNSTONE HILL,"And solitary mountain-side,"

13879,DUNSTONE HILL,"The purple mountain-side, where all"
13880,DUNSTONE HILL,"The dewy night the meteors fall,"

13893,DUNSTONE HILL,
13894,DUNSTONE HILL,Far down across the valley deep
13895,DUNSTONE HILL,"The town is hid in smoky sleep,"
13896,DUNSTONE HILL,At moonless nightfall wakening slow
13897,DUNSTONE HILL,Upon the dark with lurid glow:
13898,DUNSTONE HILL,
13899,DUNSTONE HILL,"Beyond, afar the widening view"
13900,DUNSTONE HILL,"Merges into the soften'd blue,"

13904,DUNSTONE HILL,To one who looketh from this hill
13905,DUNSTONE HILL,"Life seems asleep, all is so still:"
13906,DUNSTONE HILL,Nought passeth save the travelling shade
13907,DUNSTONE HILL,Of clouds on high that float and fade:
13908,DUNSTONE HILL,
13909,DUNSTONE HILL,Nor since this landscape saw the sun
13910,DUNSTONE HILL,"Might other motion o'er it run,"
13911,DUNSTONE HILL,Till to man's scheming heart it came

13914,DUNSTONE HILL,Him may you mark in every vale

13918,DUNSTONE HILL,

13920,DUNSTONE HILL,Rushing upon his level'd way

13922,DUNSTONE HILL,"And mocks the Roman's vaunted road,"
13923,DUNSTONE HILL,
13924,DUNSTONE HILL,Which o'er the moor purple and dun
13925,DUNSTONE HILL,"Still wanders white beneath the sun,"
13926,DUNSTONE HILL,Deserted now of men and lone
13927,DUNSTONE HILL,Save for this cot of native stone.

13939,SCREAMING TARN,The saddest place that e'er I saw
13940,SCREAMING TARN,Is the deep tarn above the inn
13941,SCREAMING TARN,"That crowns the mountain-road, whereby"
13942,SCREAMING TARN,One southward bound his way must win.
13943,SCREAMING TARN,
13944,SCREAMING TARN,Sunk on the table of the ridge
13945,SCREAMING TARN,From its deep shores is nought to see:
13946,SCREAMING TARN,The unresting wind lashes and chills
13947,SCREAMING TARN,Its shivering ripples ceaselessly.
13948,SCREAMING TARN,
13949,SCREAMING TARN,"Three sides 'tis banked with stones aslant,"
13950,SCREAMING TARN,"And down the fourth the rushes grow,"
13951,SCREAMING TARN,And yellow sedge fringing the edge
13952,SCREAMING TARN,With lengthen'd image all arow.
13953,SCREAMING TARN,
13954,SCREAMING TARN,"'Tis square and black, and on its face"
13955,SCREAMING TARN,"When noon is still, the mirror'd sky"
13956,SCREAMING TARN,Looks dark and further from the earth
13957,SCREAMING TARN,Than when you gaze at it on high.
13958,SCREAMING TARN,
13959,SCREAMING TARN,"At mid of night, if one be there,"
13960,SCREAMING TARN,--So say the people of the hill--
13961,SCREAMING TARN,"A fearful shriek of death is heard,"
13962,SCREAMING TARN,One sudden scream both loud and shrill.
13963,SCREAMING TARN,
13964,SCREAMING TARN,"And some have seen on stilly nights,"
13965,SCREAMING TARN,"And when the moon was clear and round,"
13966,SCREAMING TARN,Bubbles which to the surface swam
13967,SCREAMING TARN,And burst as if they held the sound.--
13968,SCREAMING TARN,
13969,SCREAMING TARN,'Twas in the days ere hapless Charles
13970,SCREAMING TARN,"Losing his crown had lost his head,"
13971,SCREAMING TARN,This tale is told of him who kept
13972,SCREAMING TARN,The inn upon the watershed:
13973,SCREAMING TARN,
13974,SCREAMING TARN,He was a lowbred ruin'd man
13975,SCREAMING TARN,Whom lawless times set free from fear:
13976,SCREAMING TARN,One evening to his house there rode
13977,SCREAMING TARN,A young and gentle cavalier.
13978,SCREAMING TARN,
13979,SCREAMING TARN,With curling hair and linen fair
13980,SCREAMING TARN,And jewel-hilted sword he went;
13981,SCREAMING TARN,"The horse he rode he had ridden far,"
13982,SCREAMING TARN,And he was with his journey spent.
13983,SCREAMING TARN,
13984,SCREAMING TARN,"He asked a lodging for the night,"
13985,SCREAMING TARN,"His valise from his steed unbound,"
13986,SCREAMING TARN,He let none bear it but himself
13987,SCREAMING TARN,And set it by him on the ground.
13988,SCREAMING TARN,
13989,SCREAMING TARN,"'Here's gold or jewels,' thought the host,"
13990,SCREAMING TARN,'That's carrying south to find the king.'
13991,SCREAMING TARN,"He chattered many a loyal word,"
13992,SCREAMING TARN,And scraps of royal airs gan sing.
13993,SCREAMING TARN,
13994,SCREAMING TARN,His guest thereat grew more at ease
13995,SCREAMING TARN,"And o'er his wine he gave a toast,"
13996,SCREAMING TARN,"But little ate, and to his room"
13997,SCREAMING TARN,Carried his sack behind the host.
13998,SCREAMING TARN,
13999,SCREAMING TARN,"'Now rest you well,' the host he said,"
14000,SCREAMING TARN,But of his wish the word fell wide;
14001,SCREAMING TARN,Nor did he now forget his son
14002,SCREAMING TARN,Who fell in fight by Cromwell's side.
14003,SCREAMING TARN,
14004,SCREAMING TARN,Revenge and poverty have brought
14005,SCREAMING TARN,Full gentler heart than his to crime;
14006,SCREAMING TARN,"And he was one by nature rude,"
14007,SCREAMING TARN,Born to foul deeds at any time.
14008,SCREAMING TARN,
14009,SCREAMING TARN,With unshod feet at dead of night
14010,SCREAMING TARN,"In stealth he to the guest-room crept,"
14011,SCREAMING TARN,"Lantern and dagger in his hand,"
14012,SCREAMING TARN,And stabbed his victim while he slept.
14013,SCREAMING TARN,
14014,SCREAMING TARN,"But as he struck a scream there came,"
14015,SCREAMING TARN,A fearful scream so loud and shrill:
14016,SCREAMING TARN,"He whelm'd the face with pillows o'er,"
14017,SCREAMING TARN,And lean'd till all had long been still.
14018,SCREAMING TARN,
14019,SCREAMING TARN,Then to the face the flame he held
14020,SCREAMING TARN,To see there should no life remain:--
14021,SCREAMING TARN,When lo! his brutal heart was quell'd:
14022,SCREAMING TARN,'Twas a fair woman he had slain.
14023,SCREAMING TARN,
14024,SCREAMING TARN,"The tan upon her face was paint,"
14025,SCREAMING TARN,"The manly hair was torn away,"
14026,SCREAMING TARN,Soft was the breast that he had pierced;
14027,SCREAMING TARN,Beautiful in her death she lay.
14028,SCREAMING TARN,
14029,SCREAMING TARN,"His was no heart to faint at crime,"
14030,SCREAMING TARN,Tho' half he wished the deed undone.
14031,SCREAMING TARN,He pulled the valise from the bed
14032,SCREAMING TARN,To find what booty he had won.
14033,SCREAMING TARN,
14034,SCREAMING TARN,"He cut the straps, and pushed within"
14035,SCREAMING TARN,His murderous fingers to their theft.
14036,SCREAMING TARN,"A deathly sweat came o'er his brow,"
14037,SCREAMING TARN,He had no sense nor meaning left.
14038,SCREAMING TARN,
14039,SCREAMING TARN,"He touched not gold, it was not cold,"
14040,SCREAMING TARN,"It was not hard, it felt like flesh."
14041,SCREAMING TARN,He drew out by the curling hair
14042,SCREAMING TARN,"A young man's head, and murder'd fresh;"
14043,SCREAMING TARN,
14044,SCREAMING TARN,"A young man's head, cut by the neck."
14045,SCREAMING TARN,"But what was dreader still to see,"
14046,SCREAMING TARN,"Her whom he had slain he saw again,"
14047,SCREAMING TARN,The twain were like as like can be.
14048,SCREAMING TARN,
14049,SCREAMING TARN,"Brother and sister if they were,"
14050,SCREAMING TARN,"Both in one shroud they now were wound,--"
14051,SCREAMING TARN,"Across his back and down the stair,"
14052,SCREAMING TARN,Out of the house without a sound.
14053,SCREAMING TARN,
14054,SCREAMING TARN,"He made his way unto the tarn,"
14055,SCREAMING TARN,The night was dark and still and dank;
14056,SCREAMING TARN,The ripple chuckling neath the boat
14057,SCREAMING TARN,Laughed as he drew it to the bank.
14058,SCREAMING TARN,
14059,SCREAMING TARN,Upon the bottom of the boat
14060,SCREAMING TARN,"He laid his burden flat and low,"
14061,SCREAMING TARN,And on them laid the square sandstones
14062,SCREAMING TARN,That round about the margin go.
14063,SCREAMING TARN,
14064,SCREAMING TARN,"Stone upon stone he weighed them down,"
14065,SCREAMING TARN,Until the boat would hold no more;
14066,SCREAMING TARN,The freeboard now was scarce an inch:
14067,SCREAMING TARN,He stripp'd his clothes and push'd from shore.
14068,SCREAMING TARN,
14069,SCREAMING TARN,All naked to the middle pool
14070,SCREAMING TARN,He swam behind in the dark night;
14071,SCREAMING TARN,And there he let the water in
14072,SCREAMING TARN,And sank his terror out of sight.
14073,SCREAMING TARN,
14074,SCREAMING TARN,"He swam ashore, and donn'd his dress,"
14075,SCREAMING TARN,And scraped his bloody fingers clean;
14076,SCREAMING TARN,Ran home and on his victim's steed
14077,SCREAMING TARN,"Mounted, and never more was seen."
14078,SCREAMING TARN,
14079,SCREAMING TARN,But to a comrade ere he died
14080,SCREAMING TARN,He told his story guess'd of none:
14081,SCREAMING TARN,So from his lips the crime returned
14082,SCREAMING TARN,To haunt the spot where it was done.

14121,(FROM THE GREEK),"His earthly lot, as the high gods had will'd,"
14122,(FROM THE GREEK),"Far from the rivalries of men, from strife,"
14123,(FROM THE GREEK),"From arms, from woman's love and toil of life."
14124,(FROM THE GREEK),Now of his lone abode I will unfold
14125,(FROM THE GREEK),"What there I saw, or was by others told."
14126,(FROM THE GREEK),
14127,(FROM THE GREEK),There is in truth a temple on the isle;
14128,(FROM THE GREEK),Therein a wooden statue of rude style
14129,(FROM THE GREEK),And workmanship antique with helm of lead:
14130,(FROM THE GREEK),"Else all is desert, uninhabited;"
14131,(FROM THE GREEK),"Only a few goats browse the wind-swept rocks,"
14132,(FROM THE GREEK),And oft the stragglers of their starving flocks
14133,(FROM THE GREEK),"Are caught and sacrificed by whomsoe'er,"
14134,(FROM THE GREEK),Whoever of chance or purpose hither fare:
14135,(FROM THE GREEK),About the fence lie strewn their bleaching bones.
14136,(FROM THE GREEK),
14137,(FROM THE GREEK),"But in the temple jewels and precious stones,"
14138,(FROM THE GREEK),"Upheapt with golden rings and vials lie,"
14139,(FROM THE GREEK),"Thankofferings to Achilles, and thereby,"
14140,(FROM THE GREEK),"Written or scratch'd upon the walls in view,"
14141,(FROM THE GREEK),"Inscriptions, with the givers' names thereto,"
14142,(FROM THE GREEK),"Some in Romaic character, some Greek,"
14143,(FROM THE GREEK),As each man in the tongue that he might speak
14144,(FROM THE GREEK),"Wrote verse of praise, or prayer for good to come,"
14145,(FROM THE GREEK),"To Achilles most, but to Patroclus some;"
14146,(FROM THE GREEK),For those who strongly would Achilles move
14147,(FROM THE GREEK),Approach him by the pathway of his love.
14148,(FROM THE GREEK),
14149,(FROM THE GREEK),"Thousands of birds frequent the sheltering shrine,"
14150,(FROM THE GREEK),"The dippers and the swimmers of the brine,"
14151,(FROM THE GREEK),"Sea-mew and gull and diving cormorant,"
14152,(FROM THE GREEK),Fishers that on the high cliff make their haunt
14153,(FROM THE GREEK),"Sheer inaccessible, and sun themselves"
14154,(FROM THE GREEK),Huddled arow upon the narrow shelves:--
14155,(FROM THE GREEK),And surely no like wonder e'er hath been
14156,(FROM THE GREEK),As that such birds should keep the temple clean;
14157,(FROM THE GREEK),But thus they do: at earliest dawn of day
14158,(FROM THE GREEK),"They flock to sea and in the waters play,"
14159,(FROM THE GREEK),"And when they well have wet their plumage light,"
14160,(FROM THE GREEK),Back to the sanctuary they take flight
14161,(FROM THE GREEK),"Splashing the walls and columns with fresh brine,"
14162,(FROM THE GREEK),"Till all the stone doth fairly drip and shine,"
14163,(FROM THE GREEK),When off again they skim asea for more
14164,(FROM THE GREEK),"And soon returning sprinkle steps and floor,"
14165,(FROM THE GREEK),And sweep all cleanly with their wide-spread wings.
14166,(FROM THE GREEK),
14167,(FROM THE GREEK),* * *
14168,(FROM THE GREEK),
14169,(FROM THE GREEK),From other men I have learnt further things.
14170,(FROM THE GREEK),"If any of free purpose, thus they tell,"
14171,(FROM THE GREEK),"Sail'd hither to consult the oracle,--"
14172,(FROM THE GREEK),"For oracle there was,--they sacrificed"
14173,(FROM THE GREEK),"Such victims as they brought, if such sufficed,"
14174,(FROM THE GREEK),"And some they slew, some to the god set free:"
14175,(FROM THE GREEK),But they who driven from their course at sea
14176,(FROM THE GREEK),"Chanced on the isle, took of the goats thereon"
14177,(FROM THE GREEK),And pray'd Achilles to accept his own.
14178,(FROM THE GREEK),"Then made they a gift, and when they had offer'd once,"
14179,(FROM THE GREEK),"If to their question there was no response,"
14180,(FROM THE GREEK),They added to the gift and asked again;
14181,(FROM THE GREEK),"Yea twice and more, until the god should deign"
14182,(FROM THE GREEK),"Answer to give, their offering they renew'd;"
14183,(FROM THE GREEK),Whereby great riches to the shrine ensued.
14184,(FROM THE GREEK),And when both sacrifice and gifts were made
14185,(FROM THE GREEK),"They worship'd at the shrine, and as they pray'd"
14186,(FROM THE GREEK),Sailors aver that often hath been seen
14187,(FROM THE GREEK),"A man like to a god, of warrior mien,"
14188,(FROM THE GREEK),A beauteous form of figure swift and strong;
14189,(FROM THE GREEK),Down on his shoulders his light hair hung long
14190,(FROM THE GREEK),And his full armour was enchast with gold:
14191,(FROM THE GREEK),"While some, who with their eyes might nought behold,"
14192,(FROM THE GREEK),Say that with music strange the air was stir'd;
14193,(FROM THE GREEK),"And some there are, who have both seen and heard:"
14194,(FROM THE GREEK),"And if a man wish to be favour'd more,"
14195,(FROM THE GREEK),He need but spend one night upon the shore;
14196,(FROM THE GREEK),To him in sleep Achilles will appear
14197,(FROM THE GREEK),"And lead him to his tent, and with good cheer"
14198,(FROM THE GREEK),Show him all friendliness that men desire;
14199,(FROM THE GREEK),"Patroclus pours the wine, and he his lyre"
14200,(FROM THE GREEK),Takes from the pole and plays the strains thereon
14201,(FROM THE GREEK),Which Cheiron taught him first on Pelion.
14202,(FROM THE GREEK),
14203,(FROM THE GREEK),* * *
14204,(FROM THE GREEK),
14205,(FROM THE GREEK),"These things I tell as they were told to me,"
14206,(FROM THE GREEK),Nor do I question but it well may be:
14207,(FROM THE GREEK),"For sure I am that, if man ever was,"
14208,(FROM THE GREEK),"Achilles was a hero, both because"
14209,(FROM THE GREEK),"Of his high birth and beauty, his country's call,"
14210,(FROM THE GREEK),"His valour of soul, his early death withal,"
14211,(FROM THE GREEK),"For Homer's praise, the crown of human art;"
14212,(FROM THE GREEK),And that above all praise he had at heart
14213,(FROM THE GREEK),"A gentler passion in her sovran sway,"
14214,(FROM THE GREEK),And when his love died threw his life away.

14337,AN ELEGY,
14338,AN ELEGY,"Ended are many days, and now but few"
14339,AN ELEGY,Remain; since therefore it is happy and true
14340,AN ELEGY,"That memoried joys keep ever their delight,"
14341,AN ELEGY,"Like steadfast stars in the blue vault of night,"
14342,AN ELEGY,While hours of pain (among those heavenly spheres
14343,AN ELEGY,"Like falling meteors, the martyr's tears)"
14344,AN ELEGY,"Dart their long trails at random, and anon,"
14345,AN ELEGY,"Ere we exclaim, pass, and for aye are gone;"
14346,AN ELEGY,Therefore my heedy thought will oft restore
14347,AN ELEGY,"The long light-hearted days that are no more,"
14348,AN ELEGY,Save where in her memorial crypt they shine
14349,AN ELEGY,Spangling the silent past with joy divine.
14350,AN ELEGY,
14351,AN ELEGY,But why in dream of this enchanted mood
14352,AN ELEGY,Should all my boyhood seem a solitude?
14353,AN ELEGY,"Good reason know I, when I wander there,"
14354,AN ELEGY,"In that transmuted scene, why all is fair;"
14355,AN ELEGY,The woods as when in holiday of spring
14356,AN ELEGY,"Million buds burst, and flowers are blossoming;"
14357,AN ELEGY,"The meadows deep in grass, the fields unshorn"
14358,AN ELEGY,"In beauty of the multitudinous corn,"
14359,AN ELEGY,"Where the strait alleys hide me, wall'd between"
14360,AN ELEGY,High bloomy stalks and rustling banners green;
14361,AN ELEGY,"The gardens, too, in dazzling hues full-blown,"
14362,AN ELEGY,With wafted scent and blazing petals strewn;
14363,AN ELEGY,"The orchards reddening thro' the patient hours,"
14364,AN ELEGY,While idle autumn in his mossy bowers
14365,AN ELEGY,Inviteth meditation to endear
14366,AN ELEGY,The sanctuaries of the mellowing year;
14367,AN ELEGY,And every spot wherein I loved to stray
14368,AN ELEGY,Hath borrowed radiance of eternal day;
14369,AN ELEGY,"But why am I ever alone, alone?"
14370,AN ELEGY,"Here in the corner of a field my throne,"
14371,AN ELEGY,Now in the branching chair of some tall tree
14372,AN ELEGY,Drinking the gale in bird-like liberty;
14373,AN ELEGY,Or to the seashore wandered in the sun
14374,AN ELEGY,To watch the fateful waves break one by one;
14375,AN ELEGY,Or if on basking downs supine I lie
14376,AN ELEGY,Bathing my spirit in blue calms of the sky;
14377,AN ELEGY,Or to the river bank am stolen by night
14378,AN ELEGY,Hearkening unto the moonlit ripple bright
14379,AN ELEGY,That warbles o'er the shallows of smooth stone;
14380,AN ELEGY,"Why should my memory find me all alone,"
14381,AN ELEGY,When I had such companions every day
14382,AN ELEGY,Jocund and dear? 'Twixt glimpses of their play
14383,AN ELEGY,"'Tis a vast solitude, wherein I see"
14384,AN ELEGY,Only myself and what I came to be.
14385,AN ELEGY,
14386,AN ELEGY,"Yet never think, dear spirits, if now ye may"
14387,AN ELEGY,"Remember aught of that brief earthly day,"
14388,AN ELEGY,"Ere ye the mournful Stygian river crost,"
14389,AN ELEGY,"From our familiar home too early lost,--"
14390,AN ELEGY,"O never think that I your tears forget,"
14391,AN ELEGY,"Or that I loved not well, or love not yet."
14392,AN ELEGY,"Nor ye who held my heart in passion's chain,--"
14393,AN ELEGY,As kings and queens succeed in glorious reign--
14394,AN ELEGY,"When, as a man, I made you to outvie"
14395,AN ELEGY,"God's work, and, as a god, then set you by"
14396,AN ELEGY,Among the sainted throng in holiest shrine
14397,AN ELEGY,Of mythic creed and poetry divine;
14398,AN ELEGY,"True was my faith, and still your loves endure,"
14399,AN ELEGY,"The jewels of my fancy, bright and pure."
14400,AN ELEGY,
14401,AN ELEGY,Nor only in fair places do I see
14402,AN ELEGY,The picture fair now it has ceased to be:
14403,AN ELEGY,"For fate once led me, and myself some days"
14404,AN ELEGY,"Did I devote, to dull laborious ways,"
14405,AN ELEGY,"By soaring thought detained to tread full low,--"
14406,AN ELEGY,Yea might I say unbeauteous paths of woe
14407,AN ELEGY,"And dreary abodes, had not my youthful sprite"
14408,AN ELEGY,Hallow'd each nook with legends of delight.
14409,AN ELEGY,Ah! o'er that smoky town who looketh now
14410,AN ELEGY,"By winter sunset from the dark hill-brow,"
14411,AN ELEGY,Under the dying trees exultantly
14412,AN ELEGY,Nursing the sting of human tragedy?
14413,AN ELEGY,"Or in that little room upstair'd so high,"
14414,AN ELEGY,"Where London's roofs in thickest huddle lie,"
14415,AN ELEGY,Who now returns at evening to entice
14416,AN ELEGY,To his fireside the joys of Paradise?
14417,AN ELEGY,"Once sacred was that hearth, and bright the air;"
14418,AN ELEGY,"The flame of man's redemption flickered there,"
14419,AN ELEGY,"In worship of those spirits, whose deathless fames"
14420,AN ELEGY,Have thrilled the stars of heaven to hear their names;
14421,AN ELEGY,They that excell'd in wisdom to create
14422,AN ELEGY,"Beauty, with mortal passion conquering fate;"
14423,AN ELEGY,"And, mid the sovran powers of elder time,"
14424,AN ELEGY,"The loveliness of music and new rhyme,"
14425,AN ELEGY,The masters young that first enthrallÃ¨d me;
14426,AN ELEGY,"Of whom if I should name, whom then but thee,"
14427,AN ELEGY,"Sweet Shelley, or the boy whose book was found"
14428,AN ELEGY,Thrust in thy bosom on thy body drowned?
14429,AN ELEGY,
14430,AN ELEGY,"O mighty Muse, wooer of virgin thought,"
14431,AN ELEGY,Beside thy charm all else counteth as nought;
14432,AN ELEGY,The revelation of thy smile doth make
14433,AN ELEGY,Him whom thou lovest reckless for thy sake;
14434,AN ELEGY,"Earthborn of suffering, that knowest well"
14435,AN ELEGY,"To call thine own, and with enamouring spell"
14436,AN ELEGY,Feedest the stolen powers of godlike youth
14437,AN ELEGY,"On dear imagination's only truth,"
14438,AN ELEGY,Building with song a temple of desire;
14439,AN ELEGY,"And with the yearning music of thy quire,"
14440,AN ELEGY,In nuptial sacrament of thought and sense
14441,AN ELEGY,Hallowest for toil the hours of indolence:
14442,AN ELEGY,"Thou in thy melancholic beauty drest,"
14443,AN ELEGY,"Subduest ill to serve thy fair behest,"
14444,AN ELEGY,"With tragic tears, and sevenfold purified"
14445,AN ELEGY,"Silver of mirth; and with extremest pride,"
14446,AN ELEGY,With secret doctrine and unfathomed lore
14447,AN ELEGY,"Remainest yet a child for evermore,"
14448,AN ELEGY,The only enchantress of the earth that art
14449,AN ELEGY,To cheer his day and staunch man's bleeding heart.
14450,AN ELEGY,
14451,AN ELEGY,"O heavenly Muse, for heavenly thee we call"
14452,AN ELEGY,"Who in the fire of love refinest all,"
14453,AN ELEGY,Accurst is he who heark'neth not thy voice;
14454,AN ELEGY,"But happy he who, numbered of thy choice,"
14455,AN ELEGY,Walketh aloof from nature's clouded plan:
14456,AN ELEGY,For all God's world is but the thought of man;
14457,AN ELEGY,"Wherein hast thou re-formed a world apart,"
14458,AN ELEGY,The mutual mirror of his better heart.
14459,AN ELEGY,"There is no foulness, misery, nor sin,"
14460,AN ELEGY,"But he who loves finds his desire therein,"
14461,AN ELEGY,And there with thee in lonely commerce lives:
14462,AN ELEGY,"Nay, all that nature gave or fortune gives,"
14463,AN ELEGY,"Joys that his spirit is most jealous of,"
14464,AN ELEGY,"His only-embraced and best-deserving love,"
14465,AN ELEGY,"Who walketh in the noon of heavenly praise,"
14466,AN ELEGY,"The troubled godhead of his children's gaze,"
14467,AN ELEGY,"Wear thine eternity, and are loved best"
14468,AN ELEGY,By thee transfigured and in thee possest;
14469,AN ELEGY,"Who madest beauty, and from thy boundless store"
14470,AN ELEGY,Of beauty shalt create for evermore.

14796,A.,"Foot it together! But of old Voltaire,"
14797,A.,I'd ask what BÃ©ranger found so sublime
14798,A.,In that man's glory to adorn his rhyme.
14799,A.,Was it mere fame?
14800,A.,
14801,B.,B.

14829,A.,"A fount of slander, flattery and spite;"

14850,A.,"That poison life and never seem to prick,"
14851,A.,"The reasonable educated grin,"

14869,B.,"In the sweet air that rallies to the sun,"

15910,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"an essay on the Virgilian Hexameter,"
15911,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,&c._
15912,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,These experiments in quantitive verse were made in fulfilment of a
15913,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,promise to William Johnson Stone that I would some day test his
15914,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,theory. His premature death converted my consent into a serious
15915,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,obligation. This personal explanation is due to myself for two
15916,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,reasons: because I might otherwise appear firstly as an advocate of
15917,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"the system, secondly as responsible for Stone's determination of"
15918,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,the lengths of English syllables. Before writing quantitive verse
15919,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,it is necessary to learn to _think_ in quantities. This is no light
15920,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"task, and a beginner requires fixed rules. Except for a few minor"
15921,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"details, which I had disputed with Mr. Stone, I was bound to take"
15922,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,his rules as he had elaborated them; and it was not until I had
15923,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,made some progress and could think fairly well in his prosody that
15924,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,I seriously criticized it. The two chief errors that I find in it
15925,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,are that he relied too much on the quality of a vowel in
15926,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"determining its syllabic length, and that he regarded the _h_ as"
15927,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,_always_ consonantal in quality. His valuation of the _er_ sound is
15928,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"doubtful, but defensible and convenient, and I have never discarded"
15929,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,it. My earlier experiments contain therefore a good many 'false
15930,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"quantities', and these, where they could not be very easily (though"
15931,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"_inconsistently_) amended, I have left, and marked most of them in"
15932,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,the text: a few false quantities do not make a poem less readable.
15933,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,Thus a long mark over a syllable means that Stone reckoned it as
15934,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"long, and that the verse requires it to be so pronounced, but that"
15935,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"I regard it as short, or at least as _doubtful_. For example on p."
15936,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,414 _R[=u]in_ is thus written. Of all accented long vowels in
15937,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,'open' position the long _u_ seems perhaps to retain its quantity
15938,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"best, but there is evidence that Tennyson held it to be shortened,"
15939,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,and I do not know whether it might be an exception or go with
15940,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"th[)e]ory, p[)i]ety, p[)o]etry, &c. Again, where a final syllable"
15941,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"should be lengthened or not shortened by position, but lacks its"
15942,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"consonantal support, I have put a [v] in the gap: these weak places"
15943,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,are chiefly due to my accepting Stone's unchanging valuation of
15944,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"_h_. My emancipation from Stone's rules was gradual, so that I have"
15945,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,not been able to distinguish definitely my earlier experiments from
15946,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"the later, in which the quantities are such as I have now come to"
15947,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,approve of: but my line-for-line paraphrase of Virgil is such a
15948,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,later experiment. It was accompanied in the _New Quarterly_ by a
15949,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"long examination of the Virgilian hexameter, to which I would refer"
15950,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,any one who is interested in the subject. In these English
15951,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,hexameters I have used and advocate the use of Miltonic elision.
15952,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,The mark ['] in the text shows where I have purposely allowed a
15953,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,short syllable to sustain a long place. Though the difficulty of
15954,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,"adapting our English syllables to the Greek rules is very great,"
15955,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,and even deterrent--for I cannot pretend to have attained to an
15956,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,absolutely consistent scheme--yet the experiments that I have made
15957,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,reveal a vast unexplored field of delicate and expressive rhythms
15958,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,hitherto unknown in our poetry: and this amply rewarded me for my
15959,_PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS_,friendly undertaking.

17249,IBANT OBSCURI,"Midway of all this tract, with secular arms an immense elm"
17250,IBANT OBSCURI,"Reareth a crowd of branches, aneath whose leafy protection"
17251,IBANT OBSCURI,"Vain dreams thickly nestle, clinging unto the foliage on high:"
17252,IBANT OBSCURI,And many strange creatures of monstrous form and features
17253,IBANT OBSCURI,"Stable about th' entrance, Centaur and Scylla's abortion,"
17254,IBANT OBSCURI,"And hundred-handed Briareus, and Lerna the wildbeast"
17255,IBANT OBSCURI,"Roaring amain, and clothed in frightful flame the ChimÃ¦ra,"
17256,IBANT OBSCURI,"Gorgons and Harpies, ['] and Pluto's three-bodied ogre."
17257,IBANT OBSCURI,"In terror Ãneas upheld his sword to defend him,                    290"
17258,IBANT OBSCURI,With ready naked point confronting their dreaded onset:
17259,IBANT OBSCURI,And had not the Sibyl warn'd how these lively spirits were
17260,IBANT OBSCURI,"All incorporeal, flitting in thin maskery of form,"
17261,IBANT OBSCURI,"He had assail'd their host, and wounded vainly the void air."
17262,IBANT OBSCURI,"Hence is a road that led them a-down to the Tartarean streams,"
17263,IBANT OBSCURI,"Where Acheron's whirlpool impetuous, into the reeky"
17264,IBANT OBSCURI,"Deep of Cokytos disgorgeth, with muddy burden."
17265,IBANT OBSCURI,"These floods one ferryman serveth, most awful of aspect,"
17266,IBANT OBSCURI,"Of squalor infernal, Ch[=a]ron: all filthily unkempt"
17267,IBANT OBSCURI,"That woolly white cheek-fleece, and fiery the blood-shotten eyeballs:  300"
17268,IBANT OBSCURI,On one shoulder a cloak knotted-up his nudity vaunteth.
17269,IBANT OBSCURI,"He himself plieth oar or pole, manageth tiller and sheet,"
17270,IBANT OBSCURI,And the relics of mÃ©n in his ash-grey barge ferries over;
17271,IBANT OBSCURI,"Already old, but green to a god and hearty will age be."
17272,IBANT OBSCURI,"Now hitherward to the bank much folk were crowding, a medley"
17273,IBANT OBSCURI,Of men and matrons; nor did death's injury conceal
17274,IBANT OBSCURI,"Bravespirited heroes, young maidens beauteous unwed,"
17275,IBANT OBSCURI,And boys borne to the grave in sight of their sorrowing sires.
17276,IBANT OBSCURI,"Countless as in the forest, at a first white frosting of autumn"
17277,IBANT OBSCURI,Sere leaves fall to the ground; or like whenas over the ocean
17278,IBANT OBSCURI,"Myr[^ia]d birds come thickly flocking, when wintry December          311"
17279,IBANT OBSCURI,"Drives them afar southward for shelter upon sunnier shores,"
17280,IBANT OBSCURI,"So throng'd they; and each his watery journey demanded,"
17281,IBANT OBSCURI,All to the further bank stretching-oÃºt their arms impatient:
17282,IBANT OBSCURI,"But the sullen boatman took now one now other at will,"
17283,IBANT OBSCURI,"While some from the river forbade he', an' drave to a distance."
17284,IBANT OBSCURI,Ãneas in wonder alike and deep pity then spake.
17285,IBANT OBSCURI,"'Tell-me,' said he, 'my guide, why flock these crowds to the water?"
17286,IBANT OBSCURI,Or what seek the spirits? or by what prejudice are these
17287,IBANT OBSCURI,"Rudely denied, while those may upon the solemn river embark?'        320"
17288,IBANT OBSCURI,T'whom[B] then briefly again the Avern[^ia]n priestess in answer.
17289,IBANT OBSCURI,"'O Son of Anchises, heavn's true-born glorious offspring,"
17290,IBANT OBSCURI,"Deep Cokytos it is thou s[^ee]st & Hell's Styg[^ia]n flood,"
17291,IBANT OBSCURI,Whose dread sanct[^io]n alone Jove's oath from falsehood assureth.
17292,IBANT OBSCURI,"These whom thou pitiedst, th' outcast and unburied are they;"
17293,IBANT OBSCURI,That ferryman Ch[=a]ron; those whom his bark carries over
17294,IBANT OBSCURI,Are the buried; nor ever may mortal across the livid lake
17295,IBANT OBSCURI,"Journey, or e'er upon Earth his bones lie peacefully entomb'd:"
17296,IBANT OBSCURI,Haunting a hundred years this mournful plain they wander
17297,IBANT OBSCURI,"Doom'd for a term, which term expired they win to deliv'rance.'      330"
17298,IBANT OBSCURI,"Then he that harken'd stood agaze, his journey arrested,"
17299,IBANT OBSCURI,Grieving at heart and much pitying their unmerited lot.
17300,IBANT OBSCURI,There miserably fellow'd in death's indignity saw he
17301,IBANT OBSCURI,"Leucaspis with his old Lycian seachieften Orontes,"
17302,IBANT OBSCURI,Whom together from Troy in home-coming over the waters
17303,IBANT OBSCURI,"Wild weather o'ermaster'd, engulphing both shipping and men."
17304,IBANT OBSCURI,"And lo! his helmsman, Palinurus, in eager emotion,"
17305,IBANT OBSCURI,"Who on th' Afric course, in bright star-light, with a fair wind,"
17306,IBANT OBSCURI,Fell by slumber opprest unheedfully into the wide sea:
17307,IBANT OBSCURI,"Whom i' the gloom when hardly he knew, now changed in affliction,    340"
17308,IBANT OBSCURI,"First he addrest. 'What God, tell-me O Palinurus, of all gods"
17309,IBANT OBSCURI,PlÃºckt you away and drown'd i' the swift wake-water abandon'd?
17310,IBANT OBSCURI,For never erst nor in else hath kind responsive Apollo
17311,IBANT OBSCURI,"Led-me astray, but alone in this thing wholly deluded,"
17312,IBANT OBSCURI,"When he aver'd that you, to remote Aus[=o]nia steering,"
17313,IBANT OBSCURI,Safe would arrive. Where now his truth? Is this the promis'd faith?'
17314,IBANT OBSCURI,"But he, 'Neither again did Phoebus wrongly bespeak thee,"
17315,IBANT OBSCURI,"My general, nor yet did a god in his enmity drown me:"
17316,IBANT OBSCURI,"For the tiller, wherewith I led thy fleet's navigation,"
17317,IBANT OBSCURI,"And still clung to, was in my struggling hold of it unshipt,         350"
17318,IBANT OBSCURI,"And came with-me' o'erboard. Ah! then, by ev'ry accurst sea,"
17319,IBANT OBSCURI,"Tho' in utter despair, far less mine own peril awed me"
17320,IBANT OBSCURI,"Than my thought o' the ship, what harm might hÃ¡p to her, yawing"
17321,IBANT OBSCURI,"In the billows helmless, with a high wind and threatening gale."
17322,IBANT OBSCURI,Two nights and one day buffeted held I to the good spar
17323,IBANT OBSCURI,"Windborne, with the current far-drifting, an' on the second morn"
17324,IBANT OBSCURI,"Saw, when a great wave raised me aloft, the Italyan highlands;"
17325,IBANT OBSCURI,"And swimming-on with effort got ashore, nay already was saved,"
17326,IBANT OBSCURI,"Had not there the wrecking savages, who spied-me defenceless,"
17327,IBANT OBSCURI,"Scarce clinging outwearied to a rock, half-drowned & speechless,     360"
17328,IBANT OBSCURI,BeÃ¡t me to death for hope of an unfound booty upon me.
17329,IBANT OBSCURI,Now to the wind and tidewash a sport my poor body rolleth.
17330,IBANT OBSCURI,"Wherefore thee, by heav'n's sweet light & airness, I pray,"
17331,IBANT OBSCURI,"By thy Sire's memories, thy hope of youthful Iulus,"
17332,IBANT OBSCURI,"Rescue-me from these ills, brave master; Go to Velija,"
17333,IBANT OBSCURI,O'er my mortality's spoil cast thou th' all-hallowing dust;
17334,IBANT OBSCURI,"Or better, if so be the goddess, heav'n's lady-Creatress,"
17335,IBANT OBSCURI,"Show-thee the way,--nor surely without high favoring impulse"
17336,IBANT OBSCURI,"Mak'st thou ventur' across these floods & black Ereban lake,--"
17337,IBANT OBSCURI,"Give thy hand-to-me', an' o'er their watery boundary bring me        370"
17338,IBANT OBSCURI,"Unto the haven of all, death's home of quiet abiding.'"
17339,IBANT OBSCURI,"Thus-he lamented, anon spake sternly the maid of Avernus."
17340,IBANT OBSCURI,"'Whence can such unruly desire, Palinurus, assail thee?"
17341,IBANT OBSCURI,Wilt thou th' Eumenidan waters visit unburied? o'erpass
17342,IBANT OBSCURI,Hell's Stygian barrier? Ch[=a]ron's boat unbidden enter?
17343,IBANT OBSCURI,Cease to believe that fate can bÃ© by prayÃ«r averted.
17344,IBANT OBSCURI,Let my sooth a litel thy cruel destiny comfort
17345,IBANT OBSCURI,"Surely the people of all thy new-found country, determin'd"
17346,IBANT OBSCURI,"By heav'n-sent omens will achieve thy purification,                  379"
17347,IBANT OBSCURI,"Build thee a tomb of honour with yearly solemnity ordain'd,"
17348,IBANT OBSCURI,And dedicate for ever thy storied name to the headland.'
17349,IBANT OBSCURI,"These words lighten awhile his fear, his sadness allaying,"
17350,IBANT OBSCURI,Nor vain was the promise his name should eternally survive.
17351,IBANT OBSCURI,"They forthwith their journey renew, tending to the water:"
17352,IBANT OBSCURI,Whom when th' old boatman descried silently emerging
17353,IBANT OBSCURI,"Out o' the leafy shadows, advancing t'ward the river-shore,"
17354,IBANT OBSCURI,"Angrily gave-he challenge, imperious in salutation."
17355,IBANT OBSCURI,"'Whosoever thou be, that approachest my river all-arm'd,"
17356,IBANT OBSCURI,"Stand to announce thyself, nor further make footing onward."
17357,IBANT OBSCURI,"Here 'tis a place of ghosts, of night & drowsy delusion:             390"
17358,IBANT OBSCURI,Forbidden unto living mortals is my Stygian keel:
17359,IBANT OBSCURI,"Truly not Alkides embarkt I cheerfully, nor took"
17360,IBANT OBSCURI,"Of Theseus or Pirithous glad custody, nay though"
17361,IBANT OBSCURI,"God-sprung were they both, warriors invincible in might:"
17362,IBANT OBSCURI,"HÃ© 'twas would sportively the guard of Tartarus enchain,"
17363,IBANT OBSCURI,Yea and from the palace with gay contumely dragged him:
17364,IBANT OBSCURI,ThÃ©y to ravish Hell's Queen from Pluto's chamber attempted.'
17365,IBANT OBSCURI,Then thus th' Amphrysian prophetess spake briefly in answer.
17366,IBANT OBSCURI,"'No such doughty designs are ours, Cease thou to be movÃ¨d!"
17367,IBANT OBSCURI,Nor these sheeny weapons intend force. Cerberus unvext
17368,IBANT OBSCURI,"Surely for us may affray the spirits with 'howling eternal,          401"
17369,IBANT OBSCURI,And chaste Persephone enjoy her queenly seclusion.
17370,IBANT OBSCURI,"Troian Ãneas, bravest and gentlest-hearted,"
17371,IBANT OBSCURI,Hath left earth to behold his father in out-lying Ades.
17372,IBANT OBSCURI,"If the image ' of a so great virtue doth not affect thee,"
17373,IBANT OBSCURI,Yet this bough'--glittering she reveal'd its golden avouchment--
17374,IBANT OBSCURI,'Thou mayst know.' Forthwith his bluster of heart was appeasÃ¨d:
17375,IBANT OBSCURI,"Nor word gave-he, but admiring the celestial omen,"
17376,IBANT OBSCURI,"That bright sprigg of weird for so long period unseen,"
17377,IBANT OBSCURI,"Quickly he-tÃºrneth about his boat, to the margin approaching,        410"
17378,IBANT OBSCURI,"And the spirits, that along the gun'al benchways sat in order,"
17379,IBANT OBSCURI,"Drave he ashore, offering readyroom: but when the vessel took"
17380,IBANT OBSCURI,"Ponderous Ãneas, her timbers crankily straining"
17381,IBANT OBSCURI,"Creak'd, an' a brown water came trickling through the upper seams."
17382,IBANT OBSCURI,"Natheless both Sibyl Ã¡nd Hero, slow wafted across stream,"
17383,IBANT OBSCURI,Safe on th' ooze & slime's hideous desolation alighted.
17384,IBANT OBSCURI,Hence the triple-throated bellowings of Cerberus invade
17385,IBANT OBSCURI,"All Hell, where opposite the arrival he lies in a vast den."
17386,IBANT OBSCURI,"But the Sibyl, who mark'd his necklaces of stiffening snakes,"
17387,IBANT OBSCURI,"Cast him a cake, poppy-drench'd with drowsiness and honey-sweeten'd.  420"
17388,IBANT OBSCURI,"He, rabid and distending a-hungry' his triply-cavern'd jaws,"
17389,IBANT OBSCURI,"Gulp'd the proffer'd morsel; when slow he-relaxt his immense bulk,"
17390,IBANT OBSCURI,And helplessly diffused fell out-sprawl'd over the whole cave.
17391,IBANT OBSCURI,"Ãneas fled by, and left full boldly the streamway,"
17392,IBANT OBSCURI,That biddeth all men across but alloweth ne'er a returning.
17393,IBANT OBSCURI,"Already now i' the air were voices heard, lamentation,"
17394,IBANT OBSCURI,And shrilly crying of infant souls by th' entry of Ades.
17395,IBANT OBSCURI,"Babes, whom unportion'd of sweet life, unblossoming buds,"
17396,IBANT OBSCURI,One black day carried off and chokt in dusty corruption.--
17397,IBANT OBSCURI,Next are they who falsely accused were wrongfully condemn'd
17398,IBANT OBSCURI,Unto the death: but here their lot by justice is order'd.            431
17399,IBANT OBSCURI,"Inquisitor Minos, with his urn, summoning to assembly"
17400,IBANT OBSCURI,"His silent council, their deed or slander arraigneth.--"
17401,IBANT OBSCURI,"Next the sullen-hearted, who rashly with else-innocent hand"
17402,IBANT OBSCURI,"Their own life did-away, for hate or weariness of light,"
17403,IBANT OBSCURI,"Imperiling their souls. How gladly, if only in Earth's air,"
17404,IBANT OBSCURI,"Would-they again their toil, discomfort, and pities endure!"
17405,IBANT OBSCURI,"Fate obstructs: deep sadness now, unloveliness awful"
17406,IBANT OBSCURI,"Rings them about, & Styx with ninefold circle enarmeth.--"
17407,IBANT OBSCURI,Not far hence they come to a land extensive on all sides;          440
17408,IBANT OBSCURI,Weeping Plain 'tis call'd:--such name such country deserveth.
17409,IBANT OBSCURI,"Here the lovers, whom fiery passion hath cruelly consumed,"
17410,IBANT OBSCURI,"Hide in leafy alleys ' and pathways bow'ry, sequester'd"
17411,IBANT OBSCURI,"By woodland myrtle, nor hath Death their sorrow ended."
17412,IBANT OBSCURI,"Here was PhÃ¦dra to see, Procris ' and sad Eriphyle,"
17413,IBANT OBSCURI,"She of her unfilial deathdoing wound not ashamÃ¨d,"
17414,IBANT OBSCURI,"Evadne, ' and Pasiphae ' and Laodamia,"
17415,IBANT OBSCURI,"And epicene Keneus, a woman to a man metamorphos'd,"
17416,IBANT OBSCURI,Now by Fate converted again to her old feminine form.
17417,IBANT OBSCURI,"'Mong these shades, her wound yet smarting ruefully, Dido"
17418,IBANT OBSCURI,Wander'd throu' the forest-obscurity; and Ãneas                      451
17419,IBANT OBSCURI,"Standing anigh knew surely the dim form, though i' the darkness"
17420,IBANT OBSCURI,"Veil'd,--as when one seÃ«th a young moon on the horizon,"
17421,IBANT OBSCURI,Or thinketh to' have seen i' the gloaming her delicate horn;
17422,IBANT OBSCURI,Tearfully in oncelov'd accents he-lovingly addrest her.
17423,IBANT OBSCURI,"'Unhappy! ah! too true 'twas told me' O unhappy Dido,"
17424,IBANT OBSCURI,Dead thou wert; to the fell extreme didst thy passion ensue.
17425,IBANT OBSCURI,"And was it I that slew-thee? Alas! Smile falsity, ye heav'ns!"
17426,IBANT OBSCURI,"And Hell-fury attest-me', if here any sanctity reigneth,"
17427,IBANT OBSCURI,"Unwilling, O my Queen, my step thy kingdom abandon'd.                460"
17428,IBANT OBSCURI,"Me the command of a god, who here my journey determines"
17429,IBANT OBSCURI,"Through Ereban darkness, through fields sown with desolation,"
17430,IBANT OBSCURI,Drave-me to wrong my heart. Nay tho' deep-pain'd to desert thee
17431,IBANT OBSCURI,I ne'er thought to provoke thy pain of mourning eternal.
17432,IBANT OBSCURI,"Stay yet awhile, ev'n here unlook'd-for again look upon me:"
17433,IBANT OBSCURI,Fly-me not ere the supreme words that Fate granteth us are said.'
17434,IBANT OBSCURI,"Thus he: but the spirit was raging, fiercely defiant,"
17435,IBANT OBSCURI,"Whom he approach'd with words to appease, with tears for atonement."
17436,IBANT OBSCURI,She to the ground downcast her ' eyes in fixity averted;
17437,IBANT OBSCURI,"Nor were her features more by his pleading affected,                 470"
17438,IBANT OBSCURI,"Than wer' a face of flint, or of ensculptur'd alabaster."
17439,IBANT OBSCURI,"At length she started disdainful, an' angrily withdrew"
17440,IBANT OBSCURI,Into a shady thicket: where her grief kindly SychÃ¦us
17441,IBANT OBSCURI,"Sooth'd with other memories, first love and virginal embrace."
17442,IBANT OBSCURI,"And ever Ãneas, to remorse by deep pity soften'd,"
17443,IBANT OBSCURI,With brimming eyes pursued her queenly figure disappearing.
17444,IBANT OBSCURI,"Thence the Sibyl to the plain's extremest boundary led him,"
17445,IBANT OBSCURI,"Where world-fam'd warriors, a lionlike company, haunted."
17446,IBANT OBSCURI,"Here great Tydeus saw he eclips'd, & here the benighted"
17447,IBANT OBSCURI,"Phantom of Adrastus, ' of stalwart ParthenopÃ¦us.                     480"
17448,IBANT OBSCURI,Here long mourn'd upon earth went all that prowess of Ilium
17449,IBANT OBSCURI,"Fallen in arms; whom, when he-beheld them, so many and great,"
17450,IBANT OBSCURI,"Much he-bewail'd. By Thersilochus his mighty brothers stood,"
17451,IBANT OBSCURI,"Children of Antenor; here Demetr[^ia]n Polyphates,"
17452,IBANT OBSCURI,"And IdÃ¦us, in old chariot-pose dreamily stalking."
17453,IBANT OBSCURI,Right and left the spirits flocking on stood crowding around him;
17454,IBANT OBSCURI,"Nor their eyes have enough; they touch, find joy unwonted"
17455,IBANT OBSCURI,"Marching in equal stÃ©p, and eager of his coming enquire."
17456,IBANT OBSCURI,"But th' Argive leaders, and they that obey'd Agamemnon"
17457,IBANT OBSCURI,"When they saw that Trojan in arms come striding among them,          490"
17458,IBANT OBSCURI,"Old terror invaded their ranks: some fled stricken, as once"
17459,IBANT OBSCURI,"They to the ships had fled for shelter; others the alarm raise,"
17460,IBANT OBSCURI,But their thin utterance mock'd vainly the lips wide parted.
17461,IBANT OBSCURI,"Here too Deiphobus he espied, his fair body mangled,"
17462,IBANT OBSCURI,"Cruelly dismember'd, disfeatur'd cruelly his face,"
17463,IBANT OBSCURI,"Face and hands; and lo! shorn closely from either temple,"
17464,IBANT OBSCURI,"Gone wer' his ears, and maim'd each nostril in impious outrage."
17465,IBANT OBSCURI,Barely he-knew him again cow'ring shamefastly' an' hiding
17466,IBANT OBSCURI,"His dire plight, & thus he 'his old companyon accosted."
17467,IBANT OBSCURI,"'Noblest Deiphobus, great Teucer's intrepid offspring,               500"
17468,IBANT OBSCURI,"Who was it, inhuman, coveted so cruel a vengeance?"
17469,IBANT OBSCURI,Who can hav' adventur'd on thÃ©e? That last terrible night
17470,IBANT OBSCURI,"Thou wert said to hav' exceeded thy bravery, an' only"
17471,IBANT OBSCURI,On thy faln enemies wert faln by weariness o'ercome.
17472,IBANT OBSCURI,Wherefor' upon the belov'd sea-shore thine empty sepulchral
17473,IBANT OBSCURI,"Mound I erected, aloud on thy ghost tearfully calling."
17474,IBANT OBSCURI,"Name and shield keep for-thee the place; but thy body, dear friend,"
17475,IBANT OBSCURI,"Found I not, to commit to the land ere sadly' I left it.'"
17476,IBANT OBSCURI,"Then the son of Priam ['] 'I thought not, friend, to reproach thee:"
17477,IBANT OBSCURI,"Thou didst all to the full, ev'n my shade's service, accomplish.     510"
17478,IBANT OBSCURI,'Twas that uninterdicted adultress from LacedÃ¦mon
17479,IBANT OBSCURI,"Drave-me to doom, & planted in hell, her trophy triumphant."
17480,IBANT OBSCURI,"On that night,--how vain a security and merrymaking"
17481,IBANT OBSCURI,"Then sullied us thou know'st, yea must too keenly remember,--"
17482,IBANT OBSCURI,"When the ill-omened horse o'erleapt Troy's lofty defences,"
17483,IBANT OBSCURI,Dragg'd in amidst our town pregnant with a burden of arm'd men.
17484,IBANT OBSCURI,"She then, her Phrygian women in feign'd phrenzy collecting,"
17485,IBANT OBSCURI,"All with torches aflame, in wild Bacchic orgy paraded,"
17486,IBANT OBSCURI,Flaring a signal aloft to her ambusht confederate Greeks.
17487,IBANT OBSCURI,I from a world of care had fled with weariful eyelids                520
17488,IBANT OBSCURI,"Unto my unhappy chamber', an' lay fast lockt in oblivyon,"
17489,IBANT OBSCURI,Sunk to the depth of rest as a child that nought will awaken.
17490,IBANT OBSCURI,"Meanwhile that paragon helpmate had robb'd me of all arms,"
17491,IBANT OBSCURI,E'en from aneath the pillow my blade of trust purloining;--
17492,IBANT OBSCURI,Then to the gate; wide flÃ­ngs she it op'n an' calls Menelaus.
17493,IBANT OBSCURI,Would not a so great service attach her faithful adorer?
17494,IBANT OBSCURI,Might not it extinguish the repute of her earlier illdeeds?
17495,IBANT OBSCURI,Brief-be the tale. Menelaus arrives: in company there came
17496,IBANT OBSCURI,"His crime-counsellor Ãolides. So, and more also"
17497,IBANT OBSCURI,"DÃ©al-ye', O Gods, to the Greeks! an' if I call justly upon you.--    530"
17498,IBANT OBSCURI,"But thou; what fortune hitherward, in turn prithy tell me,"
17499,IBANT OBSCURI,"Sent-thee alive, whether erring upon the bewildering Ocean,"
17500,IBANT OBSCURI,"Or high-prompted of heav'n, or by Fate wearily hunted,"
17501,IBANT OBSCURI,That to the sunless abodes and dusky demesnes thou approachest?'
17502,IBANT OBSCURI,Ev'n as awhile they thus converse it is already mid-day
17503,IBANT OBSCURI,"Unperceiv'd, but aloft earth's star had turn'd to declining."

17543,IBANT OBSCURI,More terrible than they the ravin'd insatiable Hydra
17544,IBANT OBSCURI,That sitteth angry within. Know too that Tartarus itself
17545,IBANT OBSCURI,Dives sheer gaping aneath in gloomy profundity downward

17552,IBANT OBSCURI,"And there Salmoneus I saw, rend'ring heavy payment,"
17553,IBANT OBSCURI,For that he idly' had mockt heav'n's fire and thunder electric;
17554,IBANT OBSCURI,With chariot many-yoked and torches brandishing on high
17555,IBANT OBSCURI,Driving among 'his Graian folk in Olympian Elis;

17563,IBANT OBSCURI,"Once foster'd, spreadeth-out o'er nine full roods his immense limbs."
17564,IBANT OBSCURI,On him a wild vulture with hook-beak greedily gorgeth
17565,IBANT OBSCURI,His liver upsprouting quick as that Hell-chicken eateth.
17566,IBANT OBSCURI,"ShÃ© diggeth and dwelleth under the vast ribs, her bloody bare neck"

17580,IBANT OBSCURI,Drawn i' the wrong: or a master's trust with perfidy had met:
17581,IBANT OBSCURI,Dungeon'd their penalties they await. Look not to be answer'd

17583,IBANT OBSCURI,"SÃ³me aye roll heavy rocks, some whirl dizzy on the revolving"
17584,IBANT OBSCURI,Spokes of a pendant wheel: sitteth and to eternity shall sit
17585,IBANT OBSCURI,Unfortun'd Theseus; while sad Phlegias saddeneth hell
17586,IBANT OBSCURI,"With vain oyez to' all loud crying a tardy repentance,"

17590,IBANT OBSCURI,This one had unfather'd his blood with bestial incest:
17591,IBANT OBSCURI,All some fearful crime had dared & vaunted achievement.
17592,IBANT OBSCURI,"What mind could harbour the offence of such recollection,"
17593,IBANT OBSCURI,"Or lend welcoming ear to the tale of iniquity and shame,"
17594,IBANT OBSCURI,And to the pains wherewith such deeds are justly requited?
17595,IBANT OBSCURI,"Ev'n when thus she' had spok'n, the priestess dear to Apollo,"
