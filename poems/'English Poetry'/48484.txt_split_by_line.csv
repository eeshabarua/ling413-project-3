152,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
153,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
154,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;
155,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;
156,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Beyond, red roofs about a narrow wharf"
157,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,In cluster; then a moulder’d church; and higher
158,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A long street climbs to one tall-tower’d mill;          5
159,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And high in heaven behind it a gray down
160,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With Danish barrows; and a hazelwood,"
161,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes"
162,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.
163,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
164,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Here on this beach a hundred years ago,          10"
165,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Three children of three houses, Annie Lee,"
166,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The prettiest little damsel in the port,"
167,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And Philip Ray the miller’s only son,"
168,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And Enoch Arden, a rough sailor’s lad"
169,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Made orphan by a winter shipwreck, play’d          15"
170,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Among the waste and lumber of the shore,"
171,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Hard coils of cordage, swarthy fishing-nets,"
172,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Anchors of rusty fluke, and boats updrawn;"
173,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And built their castles of dissolving sand
174,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To watch them overflow’d, or following up          20"
175,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And flying the white breaker, daily left"
176,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The little footprint daily wash’d away.
177,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
178,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff:
179,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,In this the children play’d at keeping house.
180,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enoch was host one day, Philip the next,          25"
181,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,While Annie still was mistress; but at times
182,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Enoch would hold possession for a week:
183,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘This is my house and this my little wife.’
184,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Mine too,’ said Philip ‘turn and turn about:’"
185,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"When, if they quarrell’d, Enoch stronger-made          30"
186,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Was master: then would Philip, his blue eyes"
187,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears,"
188,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Shriek out ‘I hate you, Enoch,’ and at this"
189,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The little wife would weep for company,"
190,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And pray them not to quarrel for her sake,          35"
191,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And say she would be little wife to both.
192,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
193,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But when the dawn of rosy childhood past,"
194,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And the new warmth of life’s ascending sun
195,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Was felt by either, either fixt his heart"
196,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"On that one girl; and Enoch spoke his love,          40"
197,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Philip loved in silence; and the girl
198,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Seem’d kinder unto Philip than to him;
199,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But she loved Enoch; tho’ she knew it not,"
200,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And would if asked deny it. Enoch set
201,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A purpose evermore before his eyes,          45"
202,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To hoard all savings to the uttermost,"
203,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To purchase his own boat, and make a home"
204,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For Annie: and so prosper’d that at last
205,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A luckier or a bolder fisherman,"
206,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A carefuller in peril, did not breathe          50"
207,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For leagues along that breaker-beaten coast
208,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Than Enoch. Likewise had he served a year
209,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"On board a merchantman, and made himself"
210,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Full sailor; and he thrice had pluck’d a life
211,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,From the dread sweep of the downstreaming seas:          55
212,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And all men look’d upon him favourably:
213,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And ere he touch’d his one and-twentieth May
214,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He purchased his own boat, and made a home"
215,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For Annie, neat and nest-like, halfway up"
216,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The narrow street that clamber’d toward the mill.          60
217,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
218,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then, on a golden autumn eventide,"
219,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The younger people making holiday,"
220,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With bag and sack and basket, great and small"
221,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Went nutting to the hazels. Philip stay’d
222,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,(His father lying sick and needing him)          65
223,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"An hour behind; but as he climbed the hill,"
224,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Just where the prone edge of the wood began
225,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To feather toward the hollow, saw the pair,"
226,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enoch and Annie, sitting hand-in-hand,"
227,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,His large gray eyes and weather-beaten face          70
228,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"All kindled by a still and sacred fire,"
229,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That burn’d as on an altar. Philip look’d,"
230,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And in their eyes and faces read his doom;
231,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then, as their faces drew together, groan’d;"
232,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And slipt aside, and like a wounded life          75"
233,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Crept down into the hollows of the wood;
234,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There, while the rest were loud in merrymaking,"
235,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Had his dark hour unseen, and rose and past"
236,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart.
237,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
238,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So these were wed, and merrily rang the bells,          80"
239,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And merrily ran the years, seven happy years,"
240,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Seven happy years of health and competence,"
241,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And mutual love and honourable toil;
242,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With children; first a daughter. In him woke,"
243,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With his first babe’s first cry, the noble wish          85"
244,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To save all earnings to the uttermost,"
245,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And give his child a better bringing up
246,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Than his had been, or hers; a wish renew’d,"
247,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,When two years after came a boy to be
248,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The rosy idol of her solitudes,          90"
249,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"While Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas,"
250,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Or often journeying landward; for in truth
251,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enoch’s white horse, and Enoch’s ocean-spoil"
252,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"In ocean-smelling osier and his face,"
253,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Rough-redden’d with a thousand winter gales,          95"
254,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Not only to the market-cross were known,"
255,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But in the leafy lanes behind the down,"
256,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Far as the portal-warding lion-whelp,"
257,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And peacock-yewtree of the lonely Hall,"
258,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Whose Friday fare was Enoch’s ministering.          100
259,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
260,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then came a change, as all things human change."
261,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Ten miles to northward of the narrow port
262,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Open’d a larger haven: thither used
263,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Enoch at times to go by land or sea;
264,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And once when there, and clambering on a mast          105"
265,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"In harbour, by mischance he slipt and fell:"
266,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A limb was broken when they lifted him;
267,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And while he lay recovering there, his wife"
268,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Bore him another son, a sickly one:"
269,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Another hand crept too across his trade          110
270,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Taking her bread and theirs: and on him fell,"
271,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Altho’ a grave and staid God-fearing man,"
272,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Yet lying thus inactive, doubt and gloom."
273,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He seem’d, as in a nightmare of the night,"
274,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To see his children leading evermore          115
275,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Low miserable lives of hand-to-mouth,"
276,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And her, he loved, a beggar: then he pray’d"
277,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Save them from this, whatever comes to me.’"
278,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And while he pray’d, the master of that ship"
279,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enoch had served in, hearing his mischance,          120"
280,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Came, for he knew the man and valued him,"
281,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Reporting of his vessel China-bound,"
282,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And wanting yet a boatswain. Would he go?
283,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There yet were many weeks before she sail’d,"
284,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Sail’d from this port. Would Enoch have the place?          125
285,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And Enoch all at once assented to it,"
286,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Rejoicing at that answer to his prayer.
287,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
288,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So now that shadow of mischance appear’d
289,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,No graver than as when some little cloud
290,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Cuts off the fiery highway of the sun,          130"
291,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And isles a light in the offing: yet the wife—
292,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,When he was gone—the children—what to do?
293,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then Enoch lay long-pondering on his plans;
294,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To sell the boat—and yet he loved her well—
295,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,How many a rough sea had he weathered in her!          135
296,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He knew her, as a horseman knows his horse—"
297,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And yet to sell her—then with what she brought
298,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Buy goods and stores—set Annie forth in trade
299,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,With all that seamen needed or their wives—
300,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So might she keep the house while he was gone.          140
301,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Should he not trade himself out yonder? go
302,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"This voyage more than once? yea, twice or thrice—"
303,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"As oft as needed—last, returning rich,"
304,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Become the master of a larger craft,"
305,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With fuller profits lead an easier life,          145"
306,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Have all his pretty young ones educated,"
307,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And pass his days in peace among his own.
308,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
309,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Thus Enoch in his heart determined all:
310,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then moving homeward came on Annie pale,"
311,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Nursing the sickly babe, her latest-born.          150"
312,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Forward she started with a happy cry,"
313,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And laid the feeble infant in his arms;
314,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Whom Enoch took, and handled all his limbs,"
315,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Appraised his weight and fondled fatherlike,"
316,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But had no heart to break his purposes          155
317,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To Annie, till the morrow, when he spoke."
318,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
319,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then first since Enoch’s golden ring had girt
320,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her finger, Annie fought against his will:"
321,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Yet not with brawling opposition she,"
322,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But manifold entreaties, many a tear,          160"
323,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Many a sad kiss by day or night renew’d
324,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,(Sure that all evil would come out of it)
325,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Besought him, supplicating, if he cared"
326,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For her or his dear children, not to go."
327,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He not for his own self caring but her,          165"
328,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her and her children, let her plead in vain;"
329,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So grieving held his will, and bore it thro.’"
330,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
331,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For Enoch parted with his old sea-friend,"
332,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Bought Annie goods and stores, and set his hand"
333,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To fit their little streetward sitting-room          170
334,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,With shelf and corner for the goods and stores.
335,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So all day long till Enoch’s last at home,"
336,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Shaking their pretty cabin, hammer and axe,"
337,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Auger and saw, while Annie seem’d to hear"
338,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her own death-scaffold raising, shrill’d and rang          175"
339,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Till this was ended, and his careful hand,—"
340,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The space was narrow,—having order’d all"
341,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Almost as neat and close as nature packs
342,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her blossom or her seedling, paused; and he,"
343,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Who needs would work for Annie to the last,          180"
344,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Ascending tired, heavily slept till morn."
345,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
346,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Enoch faced this morning of farewell
347,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Brightly and boldly. All his Annie’s fears,"
348,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Save as his Annie’s, were a laughter to him."
349,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Yet Enoch as a brave God-fearing man          185
350,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Bow’d himself down, and in that mystery"
351,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Where God-in-man is one with man-in-God,"
352,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Pray’d for a blessing on his wife and babes
353,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Whatever came to him: and then he said
354,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Annie, this voyage by the grace of God          190"
355,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Will bring fair weather yet to all of us.
356,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Keep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me,"
357,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For I’ll be back, my girl, before you know it.’"
358,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then lightly rocking baby’s cradle ‘and he,"
359,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"This pretty, puny, weakly little one,—          195"
360,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Nay—for I love him all the better for it—
361,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"God bless him, he shall sit upon my knees"
362,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And I will tell him tales of foreign parts,"
363,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And make him merry, when I come home again."
364,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Come Annie, come, cheer up before I go.’          200"
365,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
366,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Him running on thus hopefully she heard,"
367,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And almost hoped herself; but when he turn’d
368,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The current of his talk to greater things
369,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,In sailor fashion roughly sermonizing
370,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"On providence and trust in Heaven, she heard,          205"
371,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Heard and not heard him; as the village girl,"
372,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Who sets her pitcher underneath the spring,"
373,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Musing on him that used to fill it for her,"
374,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Hears and not hears, and lets it overflow."
375,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
376,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"At length she spoke ‘O Enoch, you are wise;          210"
377,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And yet for all your wisdom well know I
378,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That I shall look upon your face no more.’
379,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
380,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Well then,’ said Enoch, ‘I shall look on yours."
381,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Annie, the ship I sail in passes here"
382,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"(He named the day) get you a seaman’s glass,          215"
383,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Spy out my face, and laugh at all your fears.’"
384,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
385,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But when the last of those last moments came,"
386,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Annie, my girl, cheer up, be comforted,"
387,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Look to the babes, and till I come again,"
388,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Keep everything shipshape, for I must go.          220"
389,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And fear no more for me; or if you fear
390,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Cast all your cares on God; that anchor holds.
391,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Is He not yonder in those uttermost
392,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Parts of the morning? if I flee to these
393,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Can I go from Him? and the sea is His,          225"
394,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The sea is His: He made it.’
395,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
396,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enoch rose,"
397,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife,"
398,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And kiss’d his wonder-stricken little ones;
399,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But for the third, the sickly one, who slept          230"
400,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"After a night of feverous wakefulness,"
401,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,When Annie would have raised him Enoch said
402,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Wake him not; let him sleep; how should the child
403,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Remember this?’ and kiss’d him in his cot.
404,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Annie from her baby’s forehead clipt          235
405,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A tiny curl, and gave it: this he kept"
406,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Thro’ all his future; but now hastily caught
407,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His bundle, waved his hand, and went his way."
408,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
409,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She, when the day, that Enoch mention’d, came,"
410,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Borrow’d a glass, but all in vain: perhaps          240"
411,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,She could not fix the glass to suit her eye;
412,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Perhaps her eye was dim, hand tremulous;"
413,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,She saw him not: and while he stood on deck
414,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Waving, the moment and the vessel past."
415,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
416,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Ev’n to the last dip of the vanishing sail          245
417,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She watch’d it, and departed weeping for him;"
418,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then, tho’ she mourned his absence as his grave,"
419,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Set her sad will no less to chime with his,"
420,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But throve not in her trade, not being bred"
421,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To barter, nor compensating the want          250"
422,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"By shrewdness, neither capable of lies,"
423,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Nor asking overmuch and taking less,"
424,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And still foreboding ‘what would Enoch say?’
425,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For more than once, in days of difficulty"
426,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And pressure, had she sold her wares for less          255"
427,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Than what she gave in buying what she sold:
428,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She failed and sadden’d knowing it; and thus,"
429,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Expectant of that news which never came,"
430,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Gain’d for her own a scanty sustenance,"
431,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And lived a life of silent melancholy.          260
432,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
433,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Now the third child was sickly-born and grew
434,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Yet sicklier, tho’ the mother cared for it"
435,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With all a mother’s care: nevertheless,"
436,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Whether her business often called her from it,"
437,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Or thro’ the want of what it needed most,          265"
438,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Or means to pay the voice who best could tell
439,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"What most it needed—howsoe’er it was,"
440,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"After a lingering,—ere she was aware,—"
441,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like the caged bird escaping suddenly,"
442,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The little innocent soul flitted away.          270
443,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
444,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"In that same week when Annie buried it,"
445,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Philip’s true heart, which hunger’d for her peace"
446,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"(Since Enoch left he had not look’d upon her),"
447,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Smote him, as having kept aloof so long."
448,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Surely’ said Philip ‘I may see her now,          275"
449,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"May be some little comfort;’ therefore went,"
450,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Past thro’ the solitary room in front,"
451,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Paused for a moment at an inner door,"
452,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then struck it thrice, and, no one opening,"
453,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enter’d; but Annie, seated with her grief,          280"
454,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Fresh from the burial of her little one,"
455,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Cared not to look on any human face,"
456,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But turn’d her own toward the wall and wept.
457,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then Philip standing up said falteringly
458,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Annie, I come to ask a favour of you.’          285"
459,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
460,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He spoke; the passion in her moan’d reply
461,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Favour from one so sad and so forlorn
462,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"As I am!’ half abashed him; yet unask’d,"
463,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His bashfulness and tenderness at war,"
464,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He set himself beside her, saying to her:          290"
465,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘I came to speak to you of what he wished,"
466,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Enoch, your husband: I have ever said"
467,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,You chose the best among us—a strong man:
468,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For where he fixt his heart he set his hand
469,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To do the thing he will’d, and bore it thro’.          295"
470,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And wherefore did he go this weary way,"
471,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And leave you lonely? not to see the world—
472,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For pleasure?—nay, but for the wherewithal"
473,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To give his babes a better bringing-up
474,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Than his had been, or yours: that was his wish.          300"
475,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And if he come again, vext will he be"
476,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To find the precious morning hours were lost.
477,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And it would vex him even in his grave,"
478,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,If he could know his babes were running wild
479,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like colts about the waste. So, Annie, now—          305"
480,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Have we not known each other all our lives?
481,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I do beseech you by the love you bear
482,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Him and his children not to say me nay—
483,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For, if you will, when Enoch comes again"
484,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Why then he shall repay me—if you will,          310"
485,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Annie—for I am rich and well-to-do.
486,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Now let me put the boy and girl to school:
487,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,This is the favour that I came to ask.’
488,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
489,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then Annie with her brows against the wall
490,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Answer’d ‘I cannot look you in the face;          315
491,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I seem so foolish and so broken down.
492,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,When you came in my sorrow broke me down;
493,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And now I think your kindness breaks me down;
494,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Enoch lives; that is borne in on me:
495,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He will repay you: money can be repaid;          320
496,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Not kindness such as yours.’
497,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
498,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Philip ask’d
499,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Then you will let me, Annie?’"
500,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
501,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There she turn’d,"
502,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She rose, and fixed her swimming eyes upon him,          325"
503,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And dwelt a moment on his kindly face,"
504,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then calling down a blessing on his head
505,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Caught at his hand, and wrung it passionately,"
506,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And past into the little garth beyond.
507,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So lifted up in spirit he moved away.          330
508,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
509,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then Philip put the boy and girl to school,"
510,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And bought them needful books, and everyway,"
511,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like one who does his duty by his own,"
512,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Made himself theirs; and tho’ for Annie’s sake,"
513,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Fearing the lazy gossip of the port,          335"
514,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He oft denied his heart his dearest wish,"
515,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And seldom crost her threshold, yet he sent"
516,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Gifts by the children, garden-herbs and fruit,"
517,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The late and early roses from his wall,"
518,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Or conies from the down, and now and then,          340"
519,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,With some pretext of fineness in the meal
520,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To save the offence of charitable, flour"
521,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,From his tall mill that whistled on the waste.
522,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
523,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Philip did not fathom Annie’s mind:
524,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Scarce could the woman when he came upon her,          345"
525,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Out of full heart and boundless gratitude
526,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Light on a broken word to thank him with.
527,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Philip was her children’s all-in-all;
528,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,From distant corners of the street they ran
529,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To greet his hearty welcome heartily;          350
530,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Lords of his house and of his mill were they;
531,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Worried his passive ear with petty wrongs
532,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Or pleasures, hung upon him, play’d with him"
533,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And call’d him Father Philip. Philip gain’d
534,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,As Enoch lost; for Enoch seem’d to them          355
535,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Uncertain as a vision or a dream,"
536,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Faint as a figure seen in early dawn
537,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Down at the far end of an avenue,"
538,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Going we know not where: and so ten years,"
539,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Since Enoch left his hearth and native land,          360"
540,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Fled forward, and no news of Enoch came."
541,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
542,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,It chanced one evening Annie’s children long’d
543,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To go with others, nutting to the wood,"
544,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Annie would go with them; then they begg’d
545,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For Father Philip (as they call’d him) too:          365
546,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Him, like the working bee in blossom-dust,"
547,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Blanch’d with his mill, they found; and saying to him"
548,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Come with us father Philip’ he denied;
549,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But when the children pluck’d at him to go,"
550,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He laugh’d and yielded readily to their wish,          370"
551,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For was not Annie with them? and they went.
552,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
553,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But after scaling half the weary down,"
554,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Just where the prone edge of the wood began
555,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To feather toward the hollow, all her force"
556,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Fail’d her; and sighing ‘Let me rest’ she said;          375
557,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So Philip rested with her well-content;
558,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,While all the younger ones with jubilant cries
559,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Broke from their elders, and tumultuously"
560,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Down thro’ the whitening hazels made a plunge
561,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To the bottom, and dispersed, and bent or broke          380"
562,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The lithe reluctant boughs to tear away
563,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Their tawny clusters, crying to each other"
564,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And calling, here and there, about the wood."
565,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
566,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Philip sitting at her side forgot
567,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her presence, and remember’d one dark hour          385"
568,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Here in this wood, when like a wounded life"
569,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He crept into the shadow: at last he said
570,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Lifting his honest forehead, ‘Listen, Annie,"
571,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,How merry they are down yonder in the wood.’
572,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Tired, Annie?’ for she did not speak a word.          390"
573,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Tired?’ but her face had fallen upon her hands;
574,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"At which as with a kind of anger in him,"
575,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘The ship was lost,’ he said, ‘the ship was lost!"
576,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,No more of that! why should you kill yourself
577,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And make them orphans quite?’ And Annie said          395
578,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘I thought not of it: but—I know not why—
579,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Their voices make me feel so solitary.’
580,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
581,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then Philip coming somewhat closer spoke.
582,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Annie, there is a thing upon my mind,"
583,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And it has been upon my mind so long,          400"
584,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That tho’ I know not when it first came there,"
585,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"I know that it will out at last. O Annie,"
586,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"It is beyond all hope, against all chance,"
587,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That he who left you ten long years ago
588,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Should still be living; well then—let me speak:          405
589,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I grieve to see you poor and wanting help:
590,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I cannot help you as I wish to do
591,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Unless—they say that women are so quick—
592,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Perhaps you know what I would have you know—
593,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I wish you for my wife. I fain would prove          410
594,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A father to your children: I do think
595,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,They love me as a father: I am sure
596,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That I love them as if they were mine own;
597,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And I believe, if you were fast my wife,"
598,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That after all these sad uncertain years,          415"
599,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,We might be still as happy as God grants
600,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To any of His creatures. Think upon it:
601,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For I am well-to-do—no kin, no care,"
602,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"No burthen, save my care for you and yours:"
603,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And we have known each other all our lives,          420"
604,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And I have loved you longer than you know.’
605,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
606,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then answer’d Annie; tenderly she spoke:
607,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘You have been as God’s good angel in our house.
608,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"God bless you for it, God reward you for it,"
609,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Philip, with something happier than myself.          425"
610,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Can one love twice? can you be ever loved
611,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,As Enoch was? what is it that you ask?’
612,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘I am content’ he answer’d ‘to be loved
613,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A little after Enoch.’ ‘O’ she cried
614,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Scared as it were ‘dear Philip, wait a while:          430"
615,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,If Enoch comes—but Enoch will not come—
616,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Yet wait a year, a year is not so long:"
617,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Surely I shall be wiser in a year:
618,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,O wait a little!’ Philip sadly said
619,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Annie, as I have waited all my life          435"
620,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I well may wait a little.’ ‘Nay’ she cried
621,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘I am bound: you have my promise—in a year:
622,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Will you not bide your year as I bide mine?’
623,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Philip answer’d ‘I will bide my year.’
624,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
625,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Here both were mute, till Philip glancing up          440"
626,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Beheld the dead flame of the fallen day
627,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Pass from the Danish barrow overhead;
628,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then fearing night and chill for Annie, rose"
629,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And sent his voice beneath him thro’ the wood.
630,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Up came the children laden with their spoil;          445
631,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then all descended to the port, and there"
632,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"At Annie’s door he paused and gave his hand,"
633,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Saying gently ‘Annie, when I spoke to you,"
634,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That was your hour of weakness. I was wrong.
635,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"I am always bound to you, but you are free.’          450"
636,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then Annie weeping answer’d ‘I am bound.’
637,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
638,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She spoke; and in one moment as it were,"
639,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"While yet she went about her household ways,"
640,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Ev’n as she dwelt upon his latest words,"
641,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That he had lov’d her longer than she knew,          455"
642,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That autumn into autumn flash’d again,"
643,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And there he stood once more before her face,"
644,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Claiming her promise. ‘Is it a year?’ she ask’d.
645,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Yes, if the nuts’ he said ‘be ripe again:"
646,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Come out and see.’ But she—she put him off—          460
647,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So much to look to—such a change—a month—
648,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Give her a month—she knew that she was bound—
649,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A month—no more. Then Philip with his eyes
650,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Full of that lifelong hunger, and his voice"
651,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Shaking a little like a drunkard’s hand,          465"
652,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Take your own time, Annie, take your own time.’"
653,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Annie could have wept for pity of him;
654,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And yet she held him on delayingly
655,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With many a scarce-believable excuse,"
656,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Trying his truth and his long-sufferance,          470"
657,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Till half-another year had slipped away.
658,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
659,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"By this the lazy gossips of the port,"
660,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Abhorrent of a calculation crost
661,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Began to chafe as at a personal wrong.
662,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Some thought that Philip did but trifle with her;          475
663,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Some that she but held off to draw him on;
664,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And others laugh’d at her and Philip too,"
665,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,As simple folk that knew not their own minds;
666,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And one, in whom all evil fancies clung"
667,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like serpent eggs together, laughingly          480"
668,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Would hint at worse in either. Her own son
669,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Was silent, tho’ he often look’d his wish;"
670,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But evermore the daughter prest upon her
671,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To wed the man so dear to all of them
672,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And lift the household out of poverty;          485
673,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Philip’s rosy face contracting grew
674,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Careworn and wan; and all these things fell on her
675,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Sharp as reproach.
676,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
677,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,At last one night it chanced
678,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That Annie could not sleep, but earnestly          490"
679,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Pray’d for a sign ‘my Enoch is he gone?’
680,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then compass’d round by the blind wall of night
681,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Brook’d not the expectant terror of her heart,"
682,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Started from bed, and struck herself a light,"
683,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then desperately seized the holy Book,          495"
684,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Suddenly set it wide to find a sign,"
685,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Suddenly put her finger on the text,"
686,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Under a palmtree.’ That was nothing to her:
687,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,No meaning there: she closed the Book and slept:
688,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"When lo! her Enoch sitting on a height,          500"
689,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Under a palmtree, over him the Sun:"
690,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘He is gone,’ she thought, ‘he is happy, he is singing"
691,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Hosanna in the highest: yonder shines
692,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The Sun of Righteousness, and these be palms"
693,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Whereof the happy people strowing cried          505
694,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"“Hosanna in the highest!”’ Here she woke,"
695,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Resolved, sent for him and said wildly to him"
696,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘There is no reason why we should not wed.’
697,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Then for God’s sake,’ he answer’d, ‘both our sakes,"
698,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So you will wed me, let it be at once.’          510"
699,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
700,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So these were wed and merrily rang the bells,"
701,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Merrily rang the bells and they were wed.
702,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But never merrily beat Annie’s heart.
703,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A footstep seem’d to fall beside her path,"
704,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She knew not whence; a whisper on her ear,          515"
705,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,She knew not what; nor loved she to be left
706,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Alone at home nor ventured out alone.
707,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"What ail’d her then, that ere she enter’d, often"
708,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch,"
709,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Fearing to enter: Philip thought he knew:          520
710,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Such doubts and fears were common to her state,"
711,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Being with child: but when her child was born,"
712,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then her new child was as herself renew’d,"
713,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then the new mother came about her heart,"
714,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then her good Philip was her all-in-all,          525"
715,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And that mysterious instinct wholly died.
716,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
717,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And where was Enoch? prosperously sail’d
718,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The ship ‘Good Fortune,’ tho’ at setting forth"
719,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The Biscay, roughly ridging eastward, shook"
720,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And almost overwhelm’d her, yet unvext          530"
721,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She slipt across the summer of the world,"
722,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then after a long tumble about the Cape
723,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And frequent interchange of foul and fair,"
724,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"She passing thro’ the summer world again,"
725,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The breath of heaven came continually          535
726,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And sent her sweetly by the golden isles,"
727,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Till silent in her oriental haven.
728,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
729,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There Enoch traded for himself, and bought"
730,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Quaint monsters for the market of those times,"
731,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A gilded dragon also for the babes.          540
732,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
733,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Less lucky her home-voyage: at first indeed
734,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Thro’ many a fair sea-circle, day by day,"
735,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Scarce-rocking, her full-busted figure-head"
736,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Stared o’er the ripple feathering from her bows:
737,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then follow’d calms, and then winds variable,          545"
738,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then baffling, a long course of them; and last"
739,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Storm, such as drove her under moonless heavens"
740,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Till hard upon the cry of ‘breakers’ came
741,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The crash of ruin, and the loss of all"
742,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But Enoch and two others. Half the night,          550"
743,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Buoy’d upon floating tackle and broken spars,"
744,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"These drifted, stranding on an isle at morn"
745,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Rich, but the loneliest in a lonely sea."
746,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
747,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"No want was there of human sustenance,"
748,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Soft fruitage, mighty nuts, and nourishing roots;          555"
749,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Nor save for pity was it hard to take
750,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The helpless life so wild that it was tame.
751,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,There in a seaward-gazing mountain-gorge
752,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"They built, and thatch’d with leaves of palm, a hut,"
753,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Half hut, half native cavern. So the three,          560"
754,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Set in this Eden of all plenteousness,"
755,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Dwelt with eternal summer, ill-content."
756,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
757,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For one, the youngest, hardly more than boy,"
758,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Hurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck,"
759,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Lay lingering out a three years’ death-in-life.          565
760,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"They could not leave him. After he was gone,"
761,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The two remaining found a fallen stem;
762,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And Enoch’s comrade, careless of himself,"
763,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Fire-hollowing this in Indian fashion, fell"
764,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Sun-stricken, and that other lived alone.          570"
765,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,In those two deaths he read God’s warning ‘wait.’
766,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
767,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns"
768,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,"
769,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The slender coco’s drooping crown of plumes,"
770,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The lightning flash of insect and of bird,          575"
771,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The lustre of the long convolvuluses
772,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That coil’d around the stately stems, and ran"
773,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Ev’n to the limit of the land, the glows"
774,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And glories of the broad belt of the world,"
775,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,All these he saw; but what he fain had seen          580
776,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He could not see, the kindly human face,"
777,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard"
778,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,"
779,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The league-long roller thundering on the reef,"
780,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The moving whisper of huge trees that branch’d          585
781,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And blossom’d in the zenith, or the sweep"
782,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,"
783,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"As down the shore he ranged, or all day long"
784,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,"
785,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A shipwreck’d sailor, waiting for a sail:          590"
786,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"No sail from day to day, but every day"
787,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
788,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Among the palms and ferns and precipices;
789,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The blaze upon the waters to the east;
790,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The blaze upon his island overhead;          595
791,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The blaze upon the waters to the west;
792,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,"
793,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again"
794,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The scarlet shafts of sunrise—but no sail.
795,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
796,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There often as he watch’d or seem’d to watch,          600"
797,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So still, the golden lizard on him paused,"
798,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,A phantom made of many phantoms moved
799,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Before him haunting him, or he himself"
800,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Moved haunting people, things and places, known"
801,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Far in a darker isle beyond the line;          605
802,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The babes, their babble, Annie, the small house,"
803,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The climbing street, the mill, the leafy lanes,"
804,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The peacock-yewtree and the lonely Hall,"
805,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The horse he drove, the boat he sold, the chill"
806,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"November dawns and dewy-glooming downs,          610"
807,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The gentle shower, the smell of dying leaves,"
808,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And the low moan of leaden-colour’d seas.
809,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
810,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Once likewise, in the ringing of his ears,"
811,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Tho’ faintly, merrily—far and far away—"
812,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He heard the pealing of his parish bells;          615
813,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then, tho’ he knew not wherefore, started up"
814,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Shuddering, and when the beauteous hateful isle"
815,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Return’d upon him, had not his poor heart"
816,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Spoken with That, which being everywhere"
817,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Lets none, who speaks with Him, seem all alone,          620"
818,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Surely the man had died of solitude.
819,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
820,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Thus over Enoch’s early-silvering head
821,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The sunny and rainy seasons came and went
822,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Year after year. His hopes to see his own,"
823,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And pace the sacred old familiar fields,          625"
824,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Not yet had perished, when his lonely doom"
825,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Came suddenly to an end. Another ship
826,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"(She wanted water) blown by baffling winds,"
827,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like the Good Fortune, from her destined course,"
828,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Stay’d by this isle, not knowing where she lay:          630"
829,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For since the mate had seen at early dawn
830,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Across a break on the mist-wreathen isle
831,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The silent water slipping from the hills,"
832,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,They sent a crew that landing burst away
833,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"In search of stream or fount, and fill’d the shores          635"
834,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,With clamour. Downward from his mountain gorge
835,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Stept the long-hair’d, long-bearded solitary,"
836,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Brown, looking hardly human, strangely clad,"
837,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Muttering and mumbling, idiotlike it seem’d,"
838,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With inarticulate rage, and making signs          640"
839,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,They knew not what: and yet he led the way
840,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,To where the rivulets of sweet water ran;
841,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And ever as he mingled with the crew,"
842,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And heard them talking, his long-bounden tongue"
843,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Was loosen’d, till he made them understand;          645"
844,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Whom, when their casks were fill’d they took aboard:"
845,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And there the tale he utter’d brokenly,"
846,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Scarce credited at first but more and more,"
847,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Amazed and melted all who listen’d to it:
848,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And clothes they gave him and free passage home;          650
849,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But oft he work’d among the rest and shook
850,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,His isolation from him. None of these
851,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Came from his county, or could answer him,"
852,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"If question’d, aught of what he cared to know."
853,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And dull the voyage was with long delays,          655"
854,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The vessel scarce sea-worthy; but evermore
855,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,His fancy fled before the lazy wind
856,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Returning, till beneath a clouded moon"
857,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He like a lover down thro’ all his blood
858,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Drew in the dewy meadowy morning-breath          660
859,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Of England, blown across her ghostly wall:"
860,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And that same morning officers and men
861,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Levied a kindly tax upon themselves,"
862,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Pitying the lonely man and gave him it:
863,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then moving up the coast they landed him,          665"
864,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Ev’n in that harbour whence he sail’d before.
865,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
866,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There Enoch spoke no word to anyone,"
867,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But homeward—home—what home? had he a home?
868,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His home, he walk’d. Bright was that afternoon,"
869,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Sunny but chill; till drawn thro’ either chasm,          670"
870,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Where either haven open’d on the deeps,"
871,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Roll’d a sea-haze and whelm’d the world in gray;
872,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Cut off the length of highway on before,"
873,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And left but narrow breadth to left and right
874,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Of wither’d holt or tilth or pasturage.          675
875,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,On the nigh-naked tree the robin piped
876,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Disconsolate, and thro’ the dripping haze"
877,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down:
878,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Thicker the drizzle grew, deeper the gloom;"
879,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Last, as it seem’d, a great mist-blotted light          680"
880,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Flared on him, and he came upon the place."
881,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
882,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then down the long street having slowly stolen,"
883,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His heart foreshadowing all calamity,"
884,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His eyes upon the stones, he reach’d the home"
885,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Where Annie lived and loved him, and his babes          685"
886,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,In those far-off seven happy years were born;
887,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But finding neither light nor murmur there
888,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,(A bill of sale gleam’d thro’ the drizzle) crept
889,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Still downward thinking ‘dead or dead to me!’
890,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
891,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Down to the pool and narrow wharf he went,          690"
892,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Seeking a tavern which of old he knew,"
893,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A front of timber-crost antiquity,"
894,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So propt, worm-eaten, ruinously old,"
895,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He thought it must have gone; but he was gone
896,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Who kept it; and his widow, Miriam Lane,          695"
897,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,With daily-dwindling profits held the house;
898,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A haunt of brawling seamen once, but now"
899,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Stiller, with yet a bed for wandering men."
900,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,There Enoch rested silent many days.
901,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
902,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But Miriam Lane was good and garrulous,          700"
903,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Nor let him be, but often breaking in,"
904,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Told him with other annals of the port,"
905,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Not knowing—Enoch was so brown, so bow’d"
906,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So broken—all the story of his house.
907,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His baby’s death, her growing poverty,          705"
908,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"How Philip put her little ones to school,"
909,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And kept them in it, his long wooing her,"
910,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her slow consent, and marriage, and the birth"
911,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Of Philip’s child: and o’er his countenance
912,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"No shadow past, nor motion: anyone,          710"
913,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Regarding, well had deem’d he felt the tale"
914,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Less than the teller: only when she closed
915,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Enoch, poor man, was cast away and lost’"
916,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He, shaking his gray head pathetically,"
917,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Repeated muttering ‘cast away and lost;’          715
918,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Again in deeper inward whispers ‘lost!’
919,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
920,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Enoch yearn’d to see her face again;
921,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘If I might look on her sweet face again
922,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And know that she is happy.’ So the thought
923,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Haunted and harass’d him, and drove him forth,          720"
924,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,At evening when the dull November day
925,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Was growing duller twilight, to the hill."
926,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,There he sat down gazing on all below;
927,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There did a thousand memories roll upon him,"
928,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Unspeakable for sadness. By and by          725
929,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The ruddy square of comfortable light,"
930,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Far-blazing from the rear of Philip’s house,"
931,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Allured him, as the beacon-blaze allures"
932,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The bird of passage, till he madly strikes"
933,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Against it, and beats out his weary life.          730"
934,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
935,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"For Philip’s dwelling fronted on the street,"
936,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The latest house to landward; but behind,"
937,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"With one small gate that open’d on the waste,"
938,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Flourish’d a little garden square and wall’d:
939,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And in it throve an ancient evergreen,          735"
940,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A yewtree, and all around it ran a walk"
941,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Of shingle, and a walk divided it:"
942,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But Enoch shunn’d the middle walk and stole
943,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence"
944,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That which he better might have shunn’d, if griefs          740"
945,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw."
946,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
947,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For cups and silver on the burnish’d board
948,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Sparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:
949,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And on the right hand of the hearth he saw
950,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Philip, the slighted suitor of old times,          745"
951,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Stout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;"
952,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And o’er her second father stoopt a girl,"
953,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A later but a loftier Annie Lee,"
954,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Fair-hair’d and tall, and from her lifted hand"
955,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Dangled a length of ribbon and a ring          750
956,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To tempt the babe, who rear’d his creasy arms,"
957,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Caught at and ever miss’d it, and they laugh’d:"
958,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And on the left hand of the hearth he saw
959,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"The mother glancing often toward her babe,"
960,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But turning now and then to speak with him,          755"
961,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Her son, who stood beside her tall and strong,"
962,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And saying that which pleased him, for he smiled."
963,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
964,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Now when the dead man come to life beheld
965,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His wife his wife no more, and saw the babe"
966,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Hers, yet not his, upon the father’s knee,          760"
967,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And all the warmth, the peace, the happiness,"
968,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And his own children tall and beautiful,"
969,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And him, that other, reigning in his place,"
970,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Lord of his rights and of his children’s love,—"
971,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then he, tho’ Miriam Lane had told him all,          765"
972,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Because things seen are mightier than things heard,"
973,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Stagger’d and shook, holding the branch, and fear’d"
974,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,"
975,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Which in one moment, like the blast of doom,"
976,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth.          770
977,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
978,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He therefore turning softly like a thief,"
979,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,"
980,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And feeling all along the garden-wall,"
981,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found,"
982,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Crept to the gate, and open’d it, and closed,          775"
983,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"As lightly as a sick man’s chamber-door,"
984,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Behind him, and came out upon the waste."
985,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
986,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And there he would have knelt, but that his knees"
987,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Were feeble, so that falling prone he dug"
988,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His fingers into the wet earth, and pray’d.          780"
989,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
990,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Too hard to bear! why did they take me thence?
991,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"O God Almighty, blessed Saviour, Thou"
992,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"That did’st uphold me on my lonely isle,"
993,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness"
994,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A little longer! aid me, give me strength          785"
995,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Not to tell her, never to let her know."
996,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Help me not to break in upon her peace.
997,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,My children too! must I not speak to these?
998,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,They know me not. I should betray myself.
999,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Never: no father’s kiss for me—the girl          790
1000,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So like her mother, and the boy, my son.’"
1001,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1002,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There speech and thought and nature fail’d a little,"
1003,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced
1004,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Back toward his solitary home again,"
1005,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,All down the long and narrow street he went          795
1006,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Beating it in upon his weary brain,"
1007,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"As tho’ it were the burthen of a song,"
1008,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Not to tell her, never to let her know.’"
1009,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1010,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He was not all unhappy. His resolve
1011,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Upbore him, and firm faith, and evermore          800"
1012,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Prayer from the living source within the will,"
1013,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And beating up thro’ all the bitter world,"
1014,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Like fountains of sweet water in the sea,"
1015,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Kept him a living soul. ‘This miller’s wife’
1016,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He said to Miriam ‘that you told me of,          805"
1017,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Has she no fear that her first husband lives?’
1018,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Ay, ay, poor soul’ said Miriam, ‘fear enow!"
1019,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"If you could tell her you had seen him dead,"
1020,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Why, that would be her comfort;’ and he thought"
1021,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘After the Lord has call’d me she shall know,          810"
1022,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"I wait his time’ and Enoch set himself,"
1023,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Scorning an alms, to work whereby to live."
1024,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Almost to all things could he turn his hand.
1025,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Cooper he was and carpenter, and wrought"
1026,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To make the boatmen fishing-nets, or help’d          815"
1027,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"At lading and unlading the tall barks,"
1028,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That brought the stinted commerce of those days;
1029,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Thus earn’d a scanty living for himself:
1030,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Yet since he did but labour for himself,"
1031,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Work without hope, there was not life in it          820"
1032,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Whereby the man could live; and as the year
1033,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Roll’d itself round again to meet the day
1034,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"When Enoch had return’d, a languor came"
1035,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Upon him, gentle sickness, gradually"
1036,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Weakening the man, till he could do no more,          825"
1037,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But kept the house, his chair, and last his bed."
1038,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And Enoch bore his weakness cheerfully.
1039,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck
1040,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,See thro’ the gray skirts of a lifting squall
1041,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,The boat that bears the hope of life approach          830
1042,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To save the life despair’d of, than he saw"
1043,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Death dawning on him, and the close of all."
1044,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1045,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For thro’ that dawning gleam’d a kindlier hope
1046,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"On Enoch thinking ‘after I am gone,"
1047,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Then may she learn I loved her to the last.’          835
1048,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He call’d aloud for Miriam Lane and said
1049,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Woman, I have a secret—only swear,"
1050,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Before I tell you—swear upon the book
1051,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Not to reveal it, till you see me dead.’"
1052,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Dead,’ clamour’d the good woman, ‘hear him talk!          840"
1053,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"I warrant, man, that we shall bring you round.’"
1054,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Swear’ added Enoch sternly ‘on the book.’
1055,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And on the book, half-frighted, Miriam swore."
1056,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her,"
1057,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?’          845
1058,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘Know him?’ she said ‘I knew him far away.
1059,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Ay, ay, I mind him coming down the street;"
1060,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Held his head high, and cared for no man, he.’"
1061,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Slowly and sadly Enoch answer’d her;
1062,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘His head is low, and no man cares for him.          850"
1063,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I think I have not three days more to live;
1064,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I am the man.’ At which the woman gave
1065,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A half-incredulous, half-hysterical cry."
1066,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘You Arden, you! nay,—sure he was a foot"
1067,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Higher than you be.’ Enoch said again          855
1068,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,‘My God has bow’d me down to what I am;
1069,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,My grief and solitude have broken me;
1070,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Nevertheless, know you that I am he"
1071,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Who married—but that name has twice been changed—
1072,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I married her who married Philip Ray.          860
1073,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Sit, listen.’ Then he told her of his voyage,"
1074,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His wreck, his lonely life, his coming back,"
1075,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"His gazing in on Annie, his resolve,"
1076,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And how he kept it. As the woman heard,"
1077,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Fast flow’d the current of her easy tears,          865"
1078,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,While in her heart she yearn’d incessantly
1079,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"To rush abroad all round the little haven,"
1080,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Proclaiming Enoch Arden and his woes;
1081,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But awed and promise-bounden she forebore,"
1082,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Saying only ‘See your bairns before you go!          870
1083,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Eh, let me fetch ’em, Arden,’ and arose"
1084,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Eager to bring them down, for Enoch hung"
1085,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"A moment on her words, but then replied:"
1086,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"‘Woman, disturb me not now at the last,"
1087,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,But let me hold my purpose till I die.          875
1088,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Sit down again; mark me and understand,"
1089,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"While I have power to speak. I charge you now,"
1090,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"When you shall see her, tell her that I died"
1091,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Blessing her, praying for her, loving her;"
1092,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Save for the bar between us, loving her          880"
1093,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,As when she laid her head beside my own.
1094,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And tell my daughter Annie, whom I saw"
1095,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"So like her mother, that my latest breath"
1096,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Was spent in blessing her and praying for her.
1097,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And tell my son that I died blessing him.          885
1098,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And say to Philip that I blest him too;
1099,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He never meant us any thing but good.
1100,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But if my children care to see me dead,"
1101,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Who hardly knew me living, let them come,"
1102,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"I am their father; but she must not come,          890"
1103,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,For my dead face would vex her after-life.
1104,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And now there is but one of all my blood,"
1105,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Who will embrace me in the world-to-be:
1106,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"This hair is his: she cut it off and gave it,"
1107,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And I have borne it with me all these years,          895"
1108,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And thought to bear it with me to my grave;
1109,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"But now my mind is changed, for I shall see him,"
1110,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"My babe in bliss: wherefore when I am gone,"
1111,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Take, give her this, for it may comfort her:"
1112,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"It will moreover be a token to her,          900"
1113,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That I am he.’
1114,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1115,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,He ceased; and Miriam Lane
1116,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Made such a voluble answer promising all,"
1117,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That once again he roll’d his eyes upon her
1118,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Repeating all he wish’d, and once again          905"
1119,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,She promised.
1120,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1121,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"Then the third night after this,"
1122,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"While Enoch slumber’d motionless and pale,"
1123,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"And Miriam watch’d and dozed at intervals,"
1124,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"There came so loud a calling of the sea,          910"
1125,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,That all the houses in the haven rang.
1126,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,"He woke, he rose, he spread his arms abroad"
1127,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Crying with a loud voice ‘a sail! a sail!
1128,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,I am saved’; and so fell back and spoke no more.
1129,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1130,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,So past the strong heroic soul away.          915
1131,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,And when they buried him the little port
1132,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.
1133,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1134,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,*        *        *        *        *
1135,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1136,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1137,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1138,=ENOCH ARDEN.=,
1139,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=
1140,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,
1141,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,
1142,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,So all day long the noise of battle roll’d
1143,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Among the mountains by the winter sea;
1144,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Until King Arthur’s table, man by man,"
1145,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord,"
1146,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,          5"
1147,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,"
1148,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,"
1149,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,"
1150,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"A broken chancel with a broken cross,"
1151,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,That stood on a dark strait of barren land.          10
1152,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"On one side lay the Ocean, and on one"
1153,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Lay a great water, and the moon was full."
1154,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
1155,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,‘The sequel of to-day unsolders all
1156,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,The goodliest fellowship of famous knights          15
1157,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep
1158,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we
1159,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Shall never more, at any future time,"
1160,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,"
1161,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Walking about the gardens and the halls          20
1162,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Of Camelot, as in the days that were."
1163,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"I perish by this people which I made,—"
1164,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Tho’ Merlin sware that I should come again
1165,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"To rule once more—but let what will be, be,"
1166,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,I am so deeply smitten thro’ the helm          25
1167,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,That without help I cannot last till morn.
1168,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,"
1169,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
1170,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"In those old days, one summer noon, an arm"
1171,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,          30"
1172,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
1173,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Holding the sword—and how I row’d across
1174,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And took it, and have worn it, like a king:"
1175,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And, wheresoever I am sung or told"
1176,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"In aftertime, this also shall be known:          35"
1177,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But now delay not: take Excalibur,"
1178,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And fling him far into the middle mere:
1179,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word.’"
1180,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
1181,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,          40"
1182,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Aidless, alone, and smitten thro’ the helm."
1183,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,A little thing may harm a wounded man.
1184,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,"
1185,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.’"
1186,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"So saying, from the ruin’d shrine he stept          45"
1187,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,"
1188,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,"
1189,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang"
1190,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down"
1191,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,          50"
1192,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Came on the shining levels of the lake.
1193,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,"
1194,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And o’er him, drawing it, the winter moon,"
1195,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth"
1196,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt;          55
1197,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,"
1198,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work"
1199,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long
1200,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,"
1201,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"This way and that dividing the swift mind,          60"
1202,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,In act to throw: but at the last it seem’d
1203,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Better to leave Excalibur conceal’d
1204,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"There in the many-knotted waterflags,"
1205,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
1206,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,So strode he back slow to the wounded King.          65
1207,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
1208,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,‘Hast thou perform’d my mission which I gave?
1209,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?’
1210,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
1211,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,          70"
1212,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And the wild water lapping on the crag.’
1213,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:"
1214,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘Thou hast betray’d thy nature and thy name,"
1215,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Not rendering true answer, as beseem’d"
1216,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Thy fëalty, nor like a noble knight:          75"
1217,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"For surer sign had follow’d, either hand,"
1218,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Or voice, or else a motion of the mere."
1219,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
1220,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again"
1221,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing          80"
1222,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.’"
1223,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
1224,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,"
1225,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Counting the dewy pebbles, fix’d in thought;"
1226,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,          85"
1227,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"How curiously and strangely chased, he smote"
1228,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"His palms together, and he cried aloud,"
1229,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘And if indeed I cast the brand away,"
1230,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,"
1231,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,          90"
1232,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
1233,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"What good should follow this, if this were done?"
1234,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,"
1235,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.
1236,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Were it well to obey then, if a king demand          95"
1237,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"An act unprofitable, against himself?"
1238,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"The King is sick, and knows not what he does."
1239,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"What record, or what relic of my lord"
1240,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Should be to aftertime, but empty breath"
1241,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,          100"
1242,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,"
1243,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Some one might show it at a joust of arms,"
1244,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Saying, “King Arthur’s sword, Excalibur,"
1245,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake
1246,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps          105"
1247,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Upon the hidden bases of the hills.”
1248,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,So might some old man speak in the aftertime
1249,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"To all the people, winning reverence."
1250,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,But now much honour and much fame were lost.’
1251,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,          110"
1252,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And hid Excalibur the second time,"
1253,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And so strode back slow to the wounded King.
1254,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:"
1255,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,‘What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?’
1256,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:          115
1257,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘I heard the water lapping on the crag,"
1258,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And the long ripple washing in the reeds.’
1259,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:"
1260,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,"
1261,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!          120"
1262,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Authority forgets a dying king,"
1263,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Laid widow’d of the power in his eye
1264,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"That bow’d the will. I see thee what thou art,"
1265,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,"
1266,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"In whom should meet the offices of all,          125"
1267,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
1268,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Either from lust of gold, or like a girl"
1269,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
1270,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,"
1271,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:          130"
1272,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,"
1273,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,I will arise and slay thee with my hands.’
1274,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,"
1275,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged"
1276,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch’d the sword,          135"
1277,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And strongly wheel’d and threw it. The great brand
1278,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,"
1279,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And flashing round and round, and whirl’d in an arch,"
1280,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,"
1281,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Seen where the moving isles of winter shock          140
1282,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"By night, with noises of the northern sea."
1283,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,So flash’d and fell the brand Excalibur:
1284,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm"
1285,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
1286,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him          145"
1287,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere."
1288,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And lightly went the other to the King.
1289,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:"
1290,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,‘Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.
1291,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?’          150"
1292,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
1293,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems"
1294,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,"
1295,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,"
1296,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Not tho’ I live three lives of mortal men,          155"
1297,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
1298,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;"
1299,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But when I look’d again, behold an arm,"
1300,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
1301,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"That caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him          160"
1302,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere.’"
1303,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:"
1304,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,‘My end draws nigh; ’tis time that I were gone.
1305,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,"
1306,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And bear me to the margin; yet I fear          165
1307,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.’"
1308,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"So saying, from the pavement he half rose,"
1309,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,"
1310,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
1311,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere          170
1312,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Remorsefully regarded thro’ his tears,"
1313,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And would have spoken, but he found not words,"
1314,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,"
1315,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"O’er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,"
1316,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And rising bore him thro’ the place of tombs.          175
1317,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But, as he walk’d, King Arthur panted hard,"
1318,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
1319,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"When all the house is mute. So sigh’d the King,"
1320,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Muttering and murmuring at his ear, ‘Quick, quick!"
1321,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"I fear it is too late, and I shall die.’          180"
1322,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,"
1323,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk’d,"
1324,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Larger than human on the frozen hills.
1325,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"He heard the deep behind him, and a cry"
1326,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad.          185"
1327,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Dry clash’d his harness in the icy caves
1328,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And barren chasms, and all to left and right"
1329,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"The bare black cliff clang’d round him, as he based"
1330,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
1331,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels—          190
1332,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,"
1333,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And the long glories of the winter moon.
1334,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,"
1335,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,"
1336,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Beneath them; and descending they were ware          195
1337,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,That all the decks were dense with stately forms
1338,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these"
1339,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Three Queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose
1340,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"A cry that shiver’d to the tingling stars,"
1341,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And, as it were one voice, an agony          200"
1342,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills"
1343,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"All night in a waste land, where no one comes,"
1344,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Or hath come, since the making of the world."
1345,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then murmur’d Arthur, ‘Place me in the barge,’"
1346,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And to the barge they came. There those three Queens          205
1347,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept."
1348,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"But she, that rose the tallest of them all"
1349,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,"
1350,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And loosed the shatter’d casque, and chafed his hands,"
1351,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And call’d him by his name, complaining loud,          210"
1352,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And dropping bitter tears against his brow
1353,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white
1354,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And colourless, and like the wither’d moon"
1355,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
1356,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And all his greaves and cuisses dash’d with drops          215
1357,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls—
1358,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,That made his forehead like a rising sun
1359,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"High from the daïs-throne—were parch’d with dust,"
1360,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,"
1361,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Mix’d with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.          220
1362,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,So like a shatter’d column lay the King;
1363,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,"
1364,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"From spur to plume a star of tournament,"
1365,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Shot thro’ the lists at Camelot, and charged"
1366,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.          225
1367,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,"
1368,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"‘Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?"
1369,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
1370,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"For now I see the true old times are dead,"
1371,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"When every morning brought a noble chance,          230"
1372,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And every chance brought out a noble knight.
1373,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Such times have been not since the light that led
1374,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
1375,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved
1376,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Which was an image of the mighty world;          235
1377,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And I, the last, go forth companionless,"
1378,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And the days darken round me, and the years,"
1379,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Among new men, strange faces, other minds.’"
1380,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:
1381,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"The old order changeth, yielding place to new,          240"
1382,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And God fulfils Himself in many ways,"
1383,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
1384,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?
1385,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"I have lived my life, and that which I have done"
1386,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"May He within Himself make pure! but thou,          245"
1387,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"If thou shouldst never see my face again,"
1388,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
1389,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice"
1390,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
1391,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,For what are men better than sheep or goats          250
1392,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"That nourish a blind life within the brain,"
1393,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer"
1394,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
1395,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,For so the whole round earth is every way
1396,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.          255
1397,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,But now farewell. I am going a long way
1398,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,With these thou seëst—if indeed I go—
1399,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)
1400,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,To the island-valley of Avilion;
1401,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,          260"
1402,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
1403,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Deep-meadow’d, happy, fair with orchard-lawns"
1404,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"And bowery hollows crown’d with summer sea,"
1405,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.’
1406,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"So said he, and the barge with oar and sail          265"
1407,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan"
1408,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,"
1409,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood"
1410,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere
1411,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Revolving many memories, till the hull          270"
1412,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,"Look’d one black dot against the verge of dawn,"
1413,=MORTE D’ARTHUR.=,And on the mere the wailing died away.

1434,I.,"Are bann’d, and barr’d—forbidden fare;          10"
1435,I.,But this was for my father’s faith
1436,I.,I suffer’d chains and courted death;
1437,I.,That father perish’d at the stake
1438,I.,For tenets he would not forsake;
1439,I.,And for the same his lineal race          15

1481,III.,"We could not see each other’s face,"

1483,III.,That made us strangers in our sight;
1484,III.,And thus together—yet apart
1485,III.,"Fetter’d in hand, but joined in heart;          55"
1486,III.,’Twas still some solace in the dearth
1487,III.,"Of the pure elements of earth,"
1488,III.,"To hearken to each other’s speech,"
1489,III.,And each turn comforter to each
1490,III.,"With some new hope, or legend old,          60"

1492,III.,But even these at length grew cold.
1493,III.,"Our voices took a dreary tone,"

1495,III.,A grating sound—not full and free          65

1508,IV.,To him—with eyes as blue as heaven—          75
1509,IV.,For him my soul was sorely moved;
1510,IV.,And truly might it be distrest
1511,IV.,To see such bird in such a nest;
1512,IV.,For he was beautiful as day—
1513,IV.,(When day was beautiful to me          80
1514,IV.,"As to young eagles, being free)—"
1515,IV.,"A polar day, which will not see"

1517,IV.,"Its sleepless summer of long light,"
1518,IV.,The snow-clad offspring of the sun;          85
1519,IV.,"And thus he was as pure and bright,"
1520,IV.,"And in his natural spirit gay,"
1521,IV.,"With tears for nought but others’ ills,"
1522,IV.,"And then they flowed like mountain rills,"
1523,IV.,Unless he could assuage the woe          90

1532,V.,And perish’d in the foremost rank
1533,V.,With joy:—but not in chains to pine:
1534,V.,"His spirit wither’d with their clank,"
1535,V.,I saw it silently decline—
1536,V.,And so perchance in sooth did mine;          100
1537,V.,But yet I forced it on to cheer
1538,V.,Those relics of a home so dear.
1539,V.,"He was a hunter of the hills,"
1540,V.,Had follow’d there the deer and wolf;
1541,V.,"To him this dungeon was a gulf,          105"

1551,VI.,Which round about the wave inthrals:
1552,VI.,A double dungeon wall and wave
1553,VI.,Have made and like a living grave.
1554,VI.,Below the surface of the lake          115
1555,VI.,"The dark vault lies wherein we lay,"
1556,VI.,We heard it ripple night and day;
1557,VI.,Sounding o’er our heads it knock’d;
1558,VI.,And I have felt the winter’s spray
1559,VI.,"Wash through the bars when winds were high,          120"
1560,VI.,And wanton in the happy sky;
1561,VI.,And then the very rock hath rock’d.
1562,VI.,"And I have felt it shake, unshock’d,"

1571,VII.,"It was not that ’twas coarse and rude,"
1572,VII.,"For we were used to hunter’s fare,          130"
1573,VII.,And for the like had little care:
1574,VII.,The milk drawn from the mountain goat
1575,VII.,"Was changed for water from the moat,"
1576,VII.,Our bread was such as captives’ tears
1577,VII.,"Have moisten’d many a thousand years,          135"
1578,VII.,Since man first pent his fellow-men
1579,VII.,Like brutes within an iron den:
1580,VII.,But what were these to us or him?
1581,VII.,These wasted not his heart or limb;
1582,VII.,My brother’s soul was of that mould          140
1583,VII.,"Which in a palace had grown cold,"
1584,VII.,Had his free breathing been denied
1585,VII.,The range of the steep mountain’s side;
1586,VII.,But why delay the truth?—he died.
1587,VII.,"I saw, and could not hold his head,          145"
1588,VII.,Nor reach his dying hand—nor dead—
1589,VII.,"Though hard I strove, but strove in vain,"
1590,VII.,To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.
1591,VII.,"He died—and they unlock’d his chain,"
1592,VII.,And scoop’d for him a shallow grave          150
1593,VII.,Even from the cold earth of our cave.
1594,VII.,"I begg’d them, as a boon, to lay"
1595,VII.,His corse in dust whereon the day
1596,VII.,"Might shine—it was a foolish thought,"
1597,VII.,"But then within my brain it wrought,          155"
1598,VII.,That even in death his free-born breast
1599,VII.,In such a dungeon could not rest.
1600,VII.,I might have spared my idle prayer—
1601,VII.,They coldly laugh’d—and laid him there:
1602,VII.,The flat and turfless earth above          160
1603,VII.,The being we so much did love;
1604,VII.,"His empty chain above it leant,"

1608,VIII.,
1609,VIII.,"But he, the favourite and the flower,"
1610,VIII.,"Most cherish’d since his natal hour,          165"
1611,VIII.,"His mother’s image in fair face,"
1612,VIII.,"The infant love of all his race,"
1613,VIII.,His martyr’d father’s dearest thought
1614,VIII.,"My latest care, for whom I sought"
1615,VIII.,"To hoard my life, that his might be          170"
1616,VIII.,"Less wretched now, and one day free;"
1617,VIII.,"He, too, who yet had held untired"
1618,VIII.,A spirit natural or inspired—
1619,VIII.,"He, too, was struck, and day by day"
1620,VIII.,Was wither’d on the stalk away.          175
1621,VIII.,O God! it is a fearful thing
1622,VIII.,To see the human soul take wing
1623,VIII.,"In any shape, in any mood:—"
1624,VIII.,"I’ve seen it rushing forth in blood,"
1625,VIII.,I’ve seen it on the breaking ocean          180
1626,VIII.,"Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,"
1627,VIII.,I’ve seen the sick and ghastly bed
1628,VIII.,Of Sin delirious with its dread:
1629,VIII.,But these were horrors—this was woe
1630,VIII.,Unmixed with such—but sure and slow;          185
1631,VIII.,"He faded, and so calm and meek,"
1632,VIII.,"So softly worn, so sweetly weak,"
1633,VIII.,"So tearless, yet so tender—kind,"
1634,VIII.,And grieved for those he left behind;
1635,VIII.,With all the while a cheek whose bloom          190
1636,VIII.,"Was as a mockery of the tomb,"
1637,VIII.,Whose tints as gently sunk away
1638,VIII.,As a departing rainbow’s ray—
1639,VIII.,"An eye of most transparent light,"
1640,VIII.,"That almost made the dungeon bright,          195"
1641,VIII.,And not a word of murmur—not
1642,VIII.,A groan o’er his untimely lot—
1643,VIII.,"A little talk of better days,"
1644,VIII.,"A little hope my own to raise,"
1645,VIII.,For I was sunk in silence—lost          200
1646,VIII.,"In this last loss, of all the most;"
1647,VIII.,"And then the sighs he would suppress,"
1648,VIII.,"Of fainting nature’s feebleness,"
1649,VIII.,"More slowly drawn, grew less and less;"
1650,VIII.,"I listen’d, but I could not hear—          205"
1651,VIII.,"I call’d, for I was wild with fear;"
1652,VIII.,"I knew ’twas hopeless, but my dread"
1653,VIII.,Would not be thus admonished;
1654,VIII.,"I call’d, and thought I heard a sound—"
1655,VIII.,"I burst my chain with one strong bound,          210"
1656,VIII.,"And rush’d to him:—I found him not,"
1657,VIII.,"_I_ only stirr’d in this black spot,"
1658,VIII.,_I_ only lived—_I_ only drew
1659,VIII.,The accursed breath of dungeon-dew;
1660,VIII.,The last—the sole—the dearest link          215
1661,VIII.,"Between me and the eternal brink,"
1662,VIII.,"Which bound me to my failing race,"
1663,VIII.,Was broken in this fatal place.
1664,VIII.,"One on the earth, and one beneath—"
1665,VIII.,My brothers—both had ceased to breathe.          220
1666,VIII.,"I took that hand which lay so still,"
1667,VIII.,Alas! my own was full as chill;
1668,VIII.,"I had not strength to stir, or strive,"
1669,VIII.,But felt that I was still alive—
1670,VIII.,"A frantic feeling, when we know          225"
1671,VIII.,That what we love shall ne’er be so.
1672,VIII.,I know not why
1673,VIII.,"I could not die,"
1674,VIII.,"I had no earthly hope—but faith,"
1675,VIII.,And that forbade a selfish death.          230
1676,VIII.,
1677,IX.,IX.
1678,IX.,
1679,IX.,What next befell me then and there
1680,IX.,I know not well—I never knew—
1681,IX.,"First came the loss of light, and air,"
1682,IX.,And then of darkness too:
1683,IX.,"I had no thought, no feeling—none—          235"
1684,IX.,"Among the stones I stood a stone,"
1685,IX.,"And was, scarce conscious what I wist,"
1686,IX.,As shrubless crags within the mist;
1687,IX.,"For all was blank, and bleak, and gray,"
1688,IX.,"It was not night—it was not day,          240"
1689,IX.,"It was not even the dungeon-light,"
1690,IX.,"So hateful to my heavy sight,"
1691,IX.,"But vacancy absorbing space,"
1692,IX.,And fixedness—without a place;
1693,IX.,There were no stars—no earth—no time—          245
1694,IX.,No check—no change—no good—no crime
1695,IX.,"But silence, and a stirless breath"
1696,IX.,Which neither was of life nor death;
1697,IX.,"A sea of stagnant idleness,"
1698,IX.,"Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!          250"
1699,IX.,
1700,X.,X.
1701,X.,
1702,X.,A light broke in upon my brain—
1703,X.,It was the carol of a bird;
1704,X.,"It ceased, and then it came again,"
1705,X.,"The sweetest song ear ever heard,"
1706,X.,And mine was thankful till my eyes          255
1707,X.,"Ran over with the glad surprise,"
1708,X.,And they that moment could not see
1709,X.,I was the mate of misery;
1710,X.,But then by dull degrees came back
1711,X.,"My senses to their wonted track,          260"
1712,X.,I saw the dungeon walls and floor
1713,X.,"Close slowly round me as before,"
1714,X.,I saw the glimmer of the sun
1715,X.,"Creeping as it before had done,"
1716,X.,But through the crevice where it came          265
1717,X.,"That bird was perch’d, as fond and tame,"
1718,X.,And tamer than upon the tree;
1719,X.,"A lovely bird, with azure wings,"
1720,X.,"And song that said a thousand things,"
1721,X.,And seem’d to say them all for me!          270
1722,X.,"I never saw its like before,"
1723,X.,I ne’er shall see its likeness more:
1724,X.,"It seem’d, like me, to want a mate,"
1725,X.,"But was not half so desolate,"
1726,X.,And it was come to love me when          275
1727,X.,"None lived to love me so again,"
1728,X.,"And cheering from my dungeon’s brink,"
1729,X.,Had brought me back to feel and think.
1730,X.,"I know not if it late were free,"
1731,X.,"Or broke its cage to perch on mine,          280"
1732,X.,"But knowing well captivity,"
1733,X.,Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!
1734,X.,"Or if it were, in winged guise,"
1735,X.,A visitant from Paradise;
1736,X.,For—Heaven forgive that thought! the while          285
1737,X.,Which made me both to weep and smile—
1738,X.,I sometimes deem’d that it might be
1739,X.,My brother’s soul come down to me;
1740,X.,"But then at last away it flew,"
1741,X.,"And then ’twas mortal—well I knew,          290"
1742,X.,"For he would never thus have flown,"
1743,X.,And left me twice so doubly lone—
1744,X.,"Lone—as the corse within its shroud,"
1745,X.,"Lone—as a solitary cloud,"
1746,X.,"A single cloud on a sunny day,          295"
1747,X.,"While all the rest of heaven is clear,"
1748,X.,"A frown upon the atmosphere,"
1749,X.,That hath no business to appear
1750,X.,"When skies are blue, and earth is gay."
1751,X.,
1752,XI.,XI.
1753,XI.,
1754,XI.,"A kind of change came in my fate,          300"
1755,XI.,"My keepers grew compassionate,"
1756,XI.,"I know not what had made them so,"
1757,XI.,"They were inured to sights of woe,"
1758,XI.,But so it was:—my broken chain
1759,XI.,"With links unfasten’d did remain,          305"
1760,XI.,And it was liberty to stride
1761,XI.,"Along my cell from side to side,"
1762,XI.,"And up and down, and then athwart,"
1763,XI.,And tread it over every part;
1764,XI.,"And round the pillars one by one,          310"
1765,XI.,"Returning where my walk begun,"
1766,XI.,"Avoiding only, as I trod,"
1767,XI.,My brothers’ graves without a sod;
1768,XI.,For if I thought with heedless tread
1769,XI.,"My step profaned their lowly bed,          315"
1770,XI.,"My breath came gaspingly and thick,"
1771,XI.,And my crush’d heart fell blind and sick.
1772,XI.,
1773,XII.,XII.
1774,XII.,
1775,XII.,"I made a footing in the wall,"
1776,XII.,"It was not therefrom to escape,"
1777,XII.,"For I had buried one and all,          320"
1778,XII.,Who loved me in a human shape;
1779,XII.,And the whole earth would henceforth be
1780,XII.,A wider prison unto me:
1781,XII.,"No child—no sire—no kin had I,"
1782,XII.,No partner in my misery;          325
1783,XII.,"I thought of this, and I was glad,"
1784,XII.,For thought of them had made me mad;
1785,XII.,But I was curious to ascend
1786,XII.,"To my barr’d windows, and to bend"
1787,XII.,"Once more, upon the mountains high,          330"
1788,XII.,The quiet of a loving eye.
1789,XII.,
1790,XIII.,XIII.
1791,XIII.,
1792,XIII.,"I saw them—and they were the same,"
1793,XIII.,They were not changed like me in frame;
1794,XIII.,I saw their thousand years of snow
1795,XIII.,"On high—their wide long lake below,          335"
1796,XIII.,And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;
1797,XIII.,I heard the torrents leap and gush
1798,XIII.,O’er channell’d rock and broken bush;
1799,XIII.,"I saw the white-wall’d distant town,"
1800,XIII.,And whiter sails go skimming down;          340
1801,XIII.,"And then there was a little isle,"
1802,XIII.,"Which in my very face did smile,"
1803,XIII.,The only one in view;
1804,XIII.,"A small green isle, it seem’d no more,"
1805,XIII.,Scarce broader than my dungeon floor;          345
1806,XIII.,"But in it there were three tall trees,"
1807,XIII.,"And o’er it blew the mountain breeze,"
1808,XIII.,"And by it there were waters flowing,"
1809,XIII.,"And on it there were young flowers growing,"
1810,XIII.,Of gentle breath and hue.          350
1811,XIII.,"The fish swam by the castle wall,"
1812,XIII.,And they seem’d joyous each and all;
1813,XIII.,"The eagle rode the rising blast,"
1814,XIII.,Methought he never flew so fast
1815,XIII.,"As then to me he seem’d to fly,          355"
1816,XIII.,"And then new tears came in my eye,"
1817,XIII.,And I felt troubled—and would fain
1818,XIII.,I had not left my recent chain;
1819,XIII.,"And when I did descend again,"
1820,XIII.,The darkness of my dim abode          360
1821,XIII.,Fell on me as a heavy load;
1822,XIII.,"It was as is a new-dug grave,"
1823,XIII.,"Closing o’er one we sought to save,"
1824,XIII.,"And yet my glance, too much opprest,"
1825,XIII.,Had almost need of such a rest.          365
1826,XIII.,
1827,XIV.,XIV.
1828,XIV.,
1829,XIV.,"It might be months, or years, or days,"
1830,XIV.,"I kept no count—I took no note,"
1831,XIV.,"I had no hope my eyes to raise,"
1832,XIV.,And clear them of their dreary mote;
1833,XIV.,"At last men came to set me free,          370"
1834,XIV.,"I ask’d not why, and reck’d not where."
1835,XIV.,"It was at length the same to me,"
1836,XIV.,"Fetter’d or fetterless to be,"
1837,XIV.,I learn’d to love despair.
1838,XIV.,"And thus when they appear’d at last,          375"
1839,XIV.,"And all my bonds aside were cast,"
1840,XIV.,These heavy walls to me had grown
1841,XIV.,A hermitage—and all my own!
1842,XIV.,And half I felt as they were come
1843,XIV.,To tear me from a second home:          380
1844,XIV.,"With spiders I had friendship made,"
1845,XIV.,"And watch’d them in their sullen trade,"
1846,XIV.,"Had seen the mice by moonlight play,"
1847,XIV.,And why should I feel less than they?
1848,XIV.,"We were all inmates of one place,          385"
1849,XIV.,"And I, the monarch of each race,"
1850,XIV.,"Had power to kill—yet, strange to tell!"
1851,XIV.,In quiet we had learn’d to dwell—
1852,XIV.,"My very chains and I grew friends,"
1853,XIV.,So much a long communion tends          390
1854,XIV.,To make us what we are:—Even I
1855,XIV.,Regain’d my freedom with a sigh.

2355,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"Not to shed a tear,"

2357,=TO A SKYLARK.=,

2372,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"Singing hymns unbidden,"
2373,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Till the world is wrought

2375,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2376,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Like a high-born maiden
2377,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"In a palace tower,"
2378,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Soothing her love-laden
2379,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Soul in secret hour

2381,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2382,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Like a glow-worm golden
2383,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"In a dell of dew,"
2384,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Scattering unbeholden
2385,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Its aerial hue
2386,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view:          50
2387,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2388,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Like a rose embowered
2389,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"In its own green leaves,"
2390,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"By warm winds deflowered,"
2391,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Till the scent it gives

2393,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2394,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Sound of vernal showers
2395,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"On the twinkling grass,"

2397,=TO A SKYLARK.=,All that ever was
2398,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass.          60

2400,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"Teach us, sprite or bird,"
2401,=TO A SKYLARK.=,What sweet thoughts are thine;

2403,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Praise of love or wine

2405,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2406,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Chorus hymeneal
2407,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Or triumphant chaunt
2408,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"Match’d with thine, would be all"
2409,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"But an empty vaunt,"
2410,=TO A SKYLARK.=,A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.          70
2411,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2412,=TO A SKYLARK.=,What objects are the fountains
2413,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Of thy happy strain?
2414,=TO A SKYLARK.=,What fields or waves or mountains?
2415,=TO A SKYLARK.=,What shapes of sky or plain?

2417,=TO A SKYLARK.=,

2419,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Languor cannot be:
2420,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Shadow of annoyance
2421,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Never came near thee:
2422,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Thou lovest; but ne’er knew love’s sad satiety.          80
2423,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2424,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Waking or asleep
2425,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Thou of death must deem
2426,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Things more true and deep
2427,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"Than we mortals dream,"
2428,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?          85
2429,=TO A SKYLARK.=,
2430,=TO A SKYLARK.=,"We look before and after,"
2431,=TO A SKYLARK.=,And pine for what is not.
2432,=TO A SKYLARK.=,Our sincerest laughter
2433,=TO A SKYLARK.=,With some pain is fraught;

2464,=ENID.=,"Of that great Order of the Table Round,"
2465,=ENID.=,"Had wedded Enid, Yniol’s only child,"

2467,=ENID.=,"And as the light of Heaven varies, now"
2468,=ENID.=,"At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night"

2471,=ENID.=,In crimsons and in purples and in gems.          10
2472,=ENID.=,"And Enid, but to please her husband’s eye,"
2473,=ENID.=,Who first had found and loved her in a state
2474,=ENID.=,"Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him"
2475,=ENID.=,"In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,"
2476,=ENID.=,"Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,          15"
2477,=ENID.=,"Lov’d her, and often with her own white hands"
2478,=ENID.=,"Array’d and deck’d her, as the loveliest,"
2479,=ENID.=,"Next after her own self, in all the court."
2480,=ENID.=,"And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart"
2481,=ENID.=,"Adored her, as the stateliest and the best          20"
2482,=ENID.=,And loveliest of all women upon earth.
2483,=ENID.=,And seeing them so tender and so close
2484,=ENID.=,Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.
2485,=ENID.=,"But when a rumour rose about the Queen,"
2486,=ENID.=,"Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,          25"
2487,=ENID.=,"Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard"
2488,=ENID.=,"The world’s loud whisper breaking into storm,"
2489,=ENID.=,Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell
2490,=ENID.=,"A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,"
2491,=ENID.=,"Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,          30"
2492,=ENID.=,"Had suffer’d, or should suffer any taint"
2493,=ENID.=,"In nature: wherefore going to the King,"
2494,=ENID.=,"He made this pretext, that his princedom lay"
2495,=ENID.=,"Close on the borders of a territory,"
2496,=ENID.=,"Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,          35"
2497,=ENID.=,"Assassins, and all fliers from the hand"
2498,=ENID.=,"Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:"
2499,=ENID.=,"And therefore, till the King himself should please"
2500,=ENID.=,"To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,"
2501,=ENID.=,"He craved a fair permission to depart,          40"
2502,=ENID.=,And there defend his marches; and the King
2503,=ENID.=,"Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,"
2504,=ENID.=,"Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,"
2505,=ENID.=,"And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores"
2506,=ENID.=,"Of Severn, and they pass’d to their own land;          45"
2507,=ENID.=,"Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife"
2508,=ENID.=,"True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,"
2509,=ENID.=,He compass’d her with sweet observances
2510,=ENID.=,"And worship, never leaving her, and grew"
2511,=ENID.=,"Forgetful of his promise to the King,          50"
2512,=ENID.=,"Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,"
2513,=ENID.=,"Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,"
2514,=ENID.=,"Forgetful of his glory and his name,"
2515,=ENID.=,Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.
2516,=ENID.=,And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.          55
2517,=ENID.=,"And by and by the people, when they met"
2518,=ENID.=,"In twos and threes, or fuller companies,"
2519,=ENID.=,Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him
2520,=ENID.=,"As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,"
2521,=ENID.=,And molten down in mere uxoriousness.          60
2522,=ENID.=,And this she gather’d from the people’s eyes;
2523,=ENID.=,"This too the women who attired her head,"
2524,=ENID.=,"To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,"
2525,=ENID.=,"Told Enid, and they sadden’d her the more:"
2526,=ENID.=,"And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,          65"
2527,=ENID.=,But could not out of bashful delicacy;
2528,=ENID.=,"While he that watch’d her sadden, was the more"
2529,=ENID.=,Suspicious that her nature had a taint.
2530,=ENID.=,
2531,=ENID.=,At last it chanced that on a summer morn
2532,=ENID.=,(They sleeping each by other) the new sun          70
2533,=ENID.=,"Beat through the blindless casement of the room,"
2534,=ENID.=,And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;
2535,=ENID.=,"Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,"
2536,=ENID.=,"And bared the knotted column of his throat,"
2537,=ENID.=,"The massive square of his heroic breast,          75"
2538,=ENID.=,"And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,"
2539,=ENID.=,"As slopes a wild brook o’er a little stone,"
2540,=ENID.=,Running too vehemently to break upon it.
2541,=ENID.=,"And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,"
2542,=ENID.=,"Admiring him, and thought within herself,          80"
2543,=ENID.=,Was ever man so grandly made as he?
2544,=ENID.=,"Then, like a shadow, pass’d the people’s talk"
2545,=ENID.=,And accusation of uxoriousness
2546,=ENID.=,"Across her mind, and bowing over him,"
2547,=ENID.=,Low to her own heart piteously she said:          85
2548,=ENID.=,
2549,=ENID.=,"“O noble breast and all-puissant arms,"
2550,=ENID.=,"Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men"
2551,=ENID.=,"Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?"
2552,=ENID.=,"I _am_ the cause, because I dare not speak"
2553,=ENID.=,And tell him what I think and what they say.          90
2554,=ENID.=,And yet I hate that he should linger here;
2555,=ENID.=,I cannot love my lord and not his name.
2556,=ENID.=,"Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,"
2557,=ENID.=,"And ride with him to battle and stand by,"
2558,=ENID.=,And watch his mightful hand striking great blows          95
2559,=ENID.=,At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.
2560,=ENID.=,"Far better were I laid in the dark earth,"
2561,=ENID.=,"Not hearing any more his noble voice,"
2562,=ENID.=,"Not to be folded more in these dear arms,"
2563,=ENID.=,"And darken’d from the high light in his eyes,          100"
2564,=ENID.=,Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.
2565,=ENID.=,"Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,"
2566,=ENID.=,"And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,"
2567,=ENID.=,"Or maybe pierc’d to death before mine eyes,"
2568,=ENID.=,"And yet not dare to tell him what I think,          105"
2569,=ENID.=,"And how men slur him, saying all his force"
2570,=ENID.=,Is melted into mere effeminacy?
2571,=ENID.=,"O me, I feel that I am no true wife.”"
2572,=ENID.=,
2573,=ENID.=,"Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,"
2574,=ENID.=,And the strong passion in her made her weep          110
2575,=ENID.=,"True tears upon his broad and naked breast,"
2576,=ENID.=,"And these awoke him, and by great mischance"
2577,=ENID.=,"He heard but fragments of her later words,"
2578,=ENID.=,And that she fear’d she was not a true wife.
2579,=ENID.=,"And then he thought, “In spite of all my care,          115"
2580,=ENID.=,"For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,"
2581,=ENID.=,"She is not faithful to me, and I see her"
2582,=ENID.=,Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur’s hall.”
2583,=ENID.=,"Then, though he lov’d and reverenc’d her too much"
2584,=ENID.=,"To dream she could be guilty of foul act,          120"
2585,=ENID.=,Right through his manful breast darted the pang
2586,=ENID.=,"That makes a man, in the sweet face of her"
2587,=ENID.=,"Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable."
2588,=ENID.=,"At this he hurl’d his huge limbs out of bed,"
2589,=ENID.=,"And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,          125"
2590,=ENID.=,"“My charger and her palfrey;” then to her,"
2591,=ENID.=,“I will ride forth into the wilderness;
2592,=ENID.=,"For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,"
2593,=ENID.=,I have not fall’n so low as some would wish.
2594,=ENID.=,And you put on your worst and meanest dress          130
2595,=ENID.=,"And ride with me.” And Enid ask’d, amaz’d,"
2596,=ENID.=,"“If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.”"
2597,=ENID.=,"But he, “I charge you, ask not, but obey.”"
2598,=ENID.=,"Then she bethought her of a faded silk,"
2599,=ENID.=,"A faded mantle and a faded veil,          135"
2600,=ENID.=,"And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,"
2601,=ENID.=,Wherein she kept them folded reverently
2602,=ENID.=,"With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,"
2603,=ENID.=,"She took them, and array’d herself therein,"
2604,=ENID.=,Remembering when first he came on her          140
2605,=ENID.=,"Drest in that dress, and how he lov’d her in it,"
2606,=ENID.=,"And all her foolish fears about the dress,"
2607,=ENID.=,"And all his journey to her, as himself"
2608,=ENID.=,"Had told her, and their coming to the court."
2609,=ENID.=,
2610,=ENID.=,For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before          145
2611,=ENID.=,Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.
2612,=ENID.=,"There on a day, he sitting high in hall,"
2613,=ENID.=,"Before him came a forester of Dean,"
2614,=ENID.=,"Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart"
2615,=ENID.=,"Taller than all his fellows, milky white,          150"
2616,=ENID.=,First seen that day: these things he told the King.
2617,=ENID.=,Then the good King gave order to let blow
2618,=ENID.=,His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.
2619,=ENID.=,And when the Queen petition’d for his leave
2620,=ENID.=,"To see the hunt, allow’d it easily.          155"
2621,=ENID.=,So with the morning all the court were gone.
2622,=ENID.=,"But Guinevere lay late into the morn,"
2623,=ENID.=,"Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love"
2624,=ENID.=,"For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;"
2625,=ENID.=,"But rose at last, a single maiden with her,          160"
2626,=ENID.=,"Took horse, and forded Usk, and gain’d the wood;"
2627,=ENID.=,"There, on a little knoll beside it, stay’d"
2628,=ENID.=,Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead
2629,=ENID.=,"A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,"
2630,=ENID.=,"Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress          165"
2631,=ENID.=,"Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,"
2632,=ENID.=,Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford
2633,=ENID.=,"Behind them, and so gallop’d up the knoll."
2634,=ENID.=,"A purple scarf, at either end whereof"
2635,=ENID.=,"There swung an apple of the purest gold,          170"
2636,=ENID.=,"Sway’d round about him, as he gallop’d up"
2637,=ENID.=,"To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly"
2638,=ENID.=,In summer suit and silks of holiday.
2639,=ENID.=,"Low bow’d the tributary Prince, and she,"
2640,=ENID.=,"Sweetly and statelily, and with all grace          175"
2641,=ENID.=,"Of womanhood and queenhood, answer’d him:"
2642,=ENID.=,"“Late, late, Sir Prince,” she said, “later than we!”"
2643,=ENID.=,"“Yea, noble Queen,” he answer’d, “and so late"
2644,=ENID.=,"That I but come like you to see the hunt,"
2645,=ENID.=,"Not join it.” “Therefore wait with me,” she said;          180"
2646,=ENID.=,"“For on this little knoll, if anywhere,"
2647,=ENID.=,There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:
2648,=ENID.=,Here often they break covert at our feet.”
2649,=ENID.=,
2650,=ENID.=,"And while they listen’d for the distant hunt,"
2651,=ENID.=,"And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,          185"
2652,=ENID.=,"King Arthur’s hound of deepest mouth, there rode"
2653,=ENID.=,"Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;"
2654,=ENID.=,"Whereof the dwarf lagg’d latest, and the knight"
2655,=ENID.=,"Had vizor up, and show’d a youthful face,"
2656,=ENID.=,"Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.          190"
2657,=ENID.=,"And Guinevere, not mindful of his face"
2658,=ENID.=,"In the King’s hall, desired his name, and sent"
2659,=ENID.=,Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;
2660,=ENID.=,"Who being vicious, old and irritable,"
2661,=ENID.=,"And doubling all his master’s vice of pride,          195"
2662,=ENID.=,Made answer sharply that she should not know.
2663,=ENID.=,"“Then will I ask it of himself,” she said."
2664,=ENID.=,"“Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,” cried the dwarf;"
2665,=ENID.=,“Thou art not worthy ev’n to speak of him;”
2666,=ENID.=,"And when she put her horse toward the knight,          200"
2667,=ENID.=,"Struck at her with his whip, and she return’d"
2668,=ENID.=,Indignant to the Queen; at which Geraint
2669,=ENID.=,"Exclaiming, “Surely I will learn the name,”"
2670,=ENID.=,"Made sharply to the dwarf, and ask’d it of him,"
2671,=ENID.=,Who answer’d as before; and when the Prince          205
2672,=ENID.=,"Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,"
2673,=ENID.=,"Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek."
2674,=ENID.=,"The Prince’s blood spirted upon the scarf,"
2675,=ENID.=,"Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand"
2676,=ENID.=,"Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:          210"
2677,=ENID.=,But he from his exceeding manfulness
2678,=ENID.=,"And pure nobility of temperament,"
2679,=ENID.=,"Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrain’d"
2680,=ENID.=,"From ev’n a word, and so returning said:"
2681,=ENID.=,
2682,=ENID.=,"“I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,          215"
2683,=ENID.=,Done in your maiden’s person to yourself:
2684,=ENID.=,And I will track this vermin to their earths;
2685,=ENID.=,"For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt"
2686,=ENID.=,"To find, at some place I shall come at, arms"
2687,=ENID.=,"On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,          220"
2688,=ENID.=,"Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,"
2689,=ENID.=,"And on the third day will again be here,"
2690,=ENID.=,So that I be not fall’n in fight. Farewell.”
2691,=ENID.=,
2692,=ENID.=,"“Farewell, fair Prince,” answered the stately Queen,"
2693,=ENID.=,"“Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;          225"
2694,=ENID.=,"And may you light on all things that you love,"
2695,=ENID.=,And live to wed with her whom first you love.
2696,=ENID.=,"But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,"
2697,=ENID.=,"And I, were she the daughter of a king,"
2698,=ENID.=,"Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,          230"
2699,=ENID.=,Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.”
2700,=ENID.=,
2701,=ENID.=,"And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard"
2702,=ENID.=,"The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,"
2703,=ENID.=,"A little vex’d at losing of the hunt,"
2704,=ENID.=,"A little at the vile occasion, rode,          235"
2705,=ENID.=,"By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade"
2706,=ENID.=,"And valley, with fix’d eye following the three."
2707,=ENID.=,"At last they issued from the world of wood,"
2708,=ENID.=,"And climb’d upon a fair and even ridge,"
2709,=ENID.=,"And show’d themselves against the sky, and sank.          240"
2710,=ENID.=,"And thither came Geraint, and underneath"
2711,=ENID.=,Beheld the long street of a little town
2712,=ENID.=,"In a long valley, on one side of which,"
2713,=ENID.=,"White from the mason’s hand, a fortress rose;"
2714,=ENID.=,"And on one side a castle in decay,          245"
2715,=ENID.=,Beyond a bridge that spann’d a dry ravine:
2716,=ENID.=,And out of town and valley came a noise
2717,=ENID.=,As of a broad brook o’er a shingly bed
2718,=ENID.=,"Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks"
2719,=ENID.=,"At distance, ere they settle for the night.          250"
2720,=ENID.=,
2721,=ENID.=,And onward to the fortress rode the three
2722,=ENID.=,"And enter’d, and were lost behind the walls."
2723,=ENID.=,"“So,” thought Geraint, “I have track’d him to his earth.”"
2724,=ENID.=,"And down the long street riding wearily,"
2725,=ENID.=,"Found every hostel full, and everywhere          255"
2726,=ENID.=,"Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss"
2727,=ENID.=,And bustling whistle of the youth who scour’d
2728,=ENID.=,His master’s armour; and of such a one
2729,=ENID.=,"He ask’d, “What means the tumult in the town?”"
2730,=ENID.=,"Who told him, scouring still, “The sparrow-hawk!”          260"
2731,=ENID.=,"Then riding close behind an ancient churl,"
2732,=ENID.=,"Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,"
2733,=ENID.=,"Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,"
2734,=ENID.=,Ask’d yet once more what meant the hubbub here?
2735,=ENID.=,"Who answer’d gruffly, “Ugh! the sparrow-hawk,”          265"
2736,=ENID.=,"Then riding farther past an armourer’s,"
2737,=ENID.=,"Who, with back turn’d, and bow’d above his work,"
2738,=ENID.=,"Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,"
2739,=ENID.=,He put the self-same query; but the man
2740,=ENID.=,"Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:          270"
2741,=ENID.=,"“Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk"
2742,=ENID.=,Has little time for idle questioners.”
2743,=ENID.=,Whereat Geraint flash’d into sudden spleen:
2744,=ENID.=,“A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!
2745,=ENID.=,"Tits, wrens, and all wing’d nothings peck him dead!          275"
2746,=ENID.=,Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg
2747,=ENID.=,The murmur of the world! What is it to me?
2748,=ENID.=,"O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,"
2749,=ENID.=,Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!
2750,=ENID.=,"Speak, if you be not like the rest, hawk-mad,          280"
2751,=ENID.=,Where can I get me harbourage for the night?
2752,=ENID.=,"And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy? Speak!”"
2753,=ENID.=,"At this the armourer, turning all amazed"
2754,=ENID.=,"And seeing one so gay in purple silks,"
2755,=ENID.=,"Came forward with the helmet yet in hand,          285"
2756,=ENID.=,"And answer’d, “Pardon me, O stranger knight;"
2757,=ENID.=,"We hold a tourney here to-morrow morn,"
2758,=ENID.=,And there is scantly time for half the work.
2759,=ENID.=,Arms? truth! I know not: all are wanted here.
2760,=ENID.=,"Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,          290"
2761,=ENID.=,"It may be, at Earl Yniol’s, o’er the bridge"
2762,=ENID.=,Yonder.” He spoke and fell to work again.
2763,=ENID.=,
2764,=ENID.=,"Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,"
2765,=ENID.=,Across the bridge that spann’d the dry ravine.
2766,=ENID.=,There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl          295
2767,=ENID.=,"(His dress a suit of fray’d magnificence,"
2768,=ENID.=,"Once fit for feasts of ceremony), and said:"
2769,=ENID.=,"“Whither, fair son?” to whom Geraint replied,"
2770,=ENID.=,"“O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.”"
2771,=ENID.=,"Then Yniol, “Enter, therefore, and partake          300"
2772,=ENID.=,The slender entertainment of a house
2773,=ENID.=,"Once rich, now poor, but ever open-door’d.”"
2774,=ENID.=,"“Thanks, venerable friend,” replied Geraint;"
2775,=ENID.=,“So that you do not serve me sparrow-hawks
2776,=ENID.=,"For supper, I will enter, I will eat          305"
2777,=ENID.=,With all the passion of a twelve hours’ fast.”
2778,=ENID.=,"Then sigh’d and smil’d the hoary-headed Earl,"
2779,=ENID.=,"And answer’d, “Graver cause than yours is mine"
2780,=ENID.=,"To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk."
2781,=ENID.=,"But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,          310"
2782,=ENID.=,We will not touch upon him ev’n in jest.”
2783,=ENID.=,
2784,=ENID.=,"Then rode Geraint into the castle court,"
2785,=ENID.=,His charger trampling many a prickly star
2786,=ENID.=,Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.
2787,=ENID.=,"He look’d, and saw that all was ruinous.          315"
2788,=ENID.=,Here stood a shatter’d archway plumed with fern;
2789,=ENID.=,"And here had fall’n a great part of a tower,"
2790,=ENID.=,"Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,"
2791,=ENID.=,And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:
2792,=ENID.=,"And high above a piece of turret stair,          320"
2793,=ENID.=,"Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound"
2794,=ENID.=,"Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems"
2795,=ENID.=,"Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,"
2796,=ENID.=,"And suck’d the joining of the stones, and look’d"
2797,=ENID.=,"A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.          325"
2798,=ENID.=,
2799,=ENID.=,"And while he waited in the castle court,"
2800,=ENID.=,"The voice of Enid, Yniol’s daughter, rang"
2801,=ENID.=,"Clear through the open casement of the hall,"
2802,=ENID.=,"Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,"
2803,=ENID.=,"Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,          330"
2804,=ENID.=,Moves him to think what kind of bird it is
2805,=ENID.=,"That sings so delicately clear, and make"
2806,=ENID.=,"Conjecture of the plumage and the form,—"
2807,=ENID.=,So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;
2808,=ENID.=,And made him like a man abroad at morn          335
2809,=ENID.=,When first the liquid note beloved of men
2810,=ENID.=,Comes flying over many a windy wave
2811,=ENID.=,"To Britain, and in April suddenly"
2812,=ENID.=,"Breaks from a coppice gemm’d with green and red,"
2813,=ENID.=,"And he suspends his converse with a friend,          340"
2814,=ENID.=,"Or it may be the labour of his hands,"
2815,=ENID.=,"To think or say, “There is the nightingale,”—"
2816,=ENID.=,"So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,"
2817,=ENID.=,"“Here, by God’s grace, is the one voice for me.”"
2818,=ENID.=,
2819,=ENID.=,It chanced the song that Enid sang was one          345
2820,=ENID.=,"Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:"
2821,=ENID.=,
2822,=ENID.=,"“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;"
2823,=ENID.=,"Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;"
2824,=ENID.=,Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.
2825,=ENID.=,
2826,=ENID.=,"“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;          350"
2827,=ENID.=,With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
2828,=ENID.=,"Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great."
2829,=ENID.=,
2830,=ENID.=,"“Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;"
2831,=ENID.=,"Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;"
2832,=ENID.=,For man is man and master of his fate.          355
2833,=ENID.=,
2834,=ENID.=,"“Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;"
2835,=ENID.=,Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;
2836,=ENID.=,Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.”
2837,=ENID.=,
2838,=ENID.=,"“Hark, by the bird’s song you may learn the nest,”"
2839,=ENID.=,"Said Yniol; “enter quickly.” Entering then,          360"
2840,=ENID.=,"Right o’er a mount of newly-fallen stones,"
2841,=ENID.=,"The dusky-rafter’d many-cobwebb’d hall,"
2842,=ENID.=,He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;
2843,=ENID.=,"And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,"
2844,=ENID.=,"That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,          365"
2845,=ENID.=,"Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,"
2846,=ENID.=,"Her daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,"
2847,=ENID.=,“Here by God’s rood is the one maid for me.”
2848,=ENID.=,But none spake word except the hoary Earl:
2849,=ENID.=,"“Enid, the good knight’s horse stands in the court;          370"
2850,=ENID.=,"Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then"
2851,=ENID.=,Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;
2852,=ENID.=,And we will make us merry as we may.
2853,=ENID.=,"Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.”"
2854,=ENID.=,
2855,=ENID.=,"He spake: the Prince, as Enid pass’d him, fain          375"
2856,=ENID.=,"To follow, strode a stride; but Yniol caught"
2857,=ENID.=,"His purple scarf, and held, and said, “Forbear!"
2858,=ENID.=,"Rest! the good house, though ruin’d, O my son,"
2859,=ENID.=,Endures not that her guest should serve himself.”
2860,=ENID.=,"And reverencing the custom of the house,          380"
2861,=ENID.=,"Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore."
2862,=ENID.=,
2863,=ENID.=,So Enid took his charger to the stall;
2864,=ENID.=,"And after went her way across the bridge,"
2865,=ENID.=,"And reach’d the town, and while the Prince and Earl"
2866,=ENID.=,"Yet spoke together, came again with one,          385"
2867,=ENID.=,"A youth, that following with a costrel bore"
2868,=ENID.=,"The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine."
2869,=ENID.=,"And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,"
2870,=ENID.=,"And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread."
2871,=ENID.=,"And then, because their hall must also serve          390"
2872,=ENID.=,"For kitchen, boil’d the flesh and spread the board,"
2873,=ENID.=,"And stood behind, and waited on the three."
2874,=ENID.=,"And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,"
2875,=ENID.=,Geraint had a longing in him evermore
2876,=ENID.=,"To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,          395"
2877,=ENID.=,That crost the trencher as she laid it down:
2878,=ENID.=,"But after all had eaten, then Geraint,"
2879,=ENID.=,"For now the wine made summer in his veins,"
2880,=ENID.=,"Let his eye rove in following, or rest"
2881,=ENID.=,"On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,          400"
2882,=ENID.=,"Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;"
2883,=ENID.=,Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:
2884,=ENID.=,
2885,=ENID.=,"“Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;"
2886,=ENID.=,"This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him."
2887,=ENID.=,"His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it;          405"
2888,=ENID.=,For if he be the knight whom late I saw
2889,=ENID.=,"Ride into that new fortress by your town,"
2890,=ENID.=,"White from the mason’s hand, then have I sworn"
2891,=ENID.=,From his own lips to have it—I am Geraint
2892,=ENID.=,Of Devon—for this morning when the Queen          410
2893,=ENID.=,"Sent her own maiden to demand the name,"
2894,=ENID.=,"His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,"
2895,=ENID.=,"Struck at her with his whip, and she return’d"
2896,=ENID.=,Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore
2897,=ENID.=,"That I would track this caitiff to his hold,          415"
2898,=ENID.=,"And fight and break his pride, and have it of him."
2899,=ENID.=,"And all unarm’d I rode, and thought to find"
2900,=ENID.=,"Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;"
2901,=ENID.=,They take the rustic murmur of their bourg
2902,=ENID.=,For the great wave that echoes round the world;          420
2903,=ENID.=,They would not hear me speak; but if you know
2904,=ENID.=,"Where I can light on arms, or if yourself"
2905,=ENID.=,"Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn"
2906,=ENID.=,"That I will break his pride and learn his name,"
2907,=ENID.=,Avenging this great insult done the Queen.”          425
2908,=ENID.=,
2909,=ENID.=,"Then cried Earl Yniol, “Art thou he indeed,"
2910,=ENID.=,"Geraint, a name far sounded among men"
2911,=ENID.=,"For noble deeds? and truly I, when first"
2912,=ENID.=,"I saw you moving by me on the bridge,"
2913,=ENID.=,"Felt you were somewhat, yea, and by your state          430"
2914,=ENID.=,And presence might have guess’d you one of those
2915,=ENID.=,That eat in Arthur’s hall at Camelot.
2916,=ENID.=,Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;
2917,=ENID.=,For this dear child hath often heard me praise
2918,=ENID.=,"Your feats of arms, and often when I paused          435"
2919,=ENID.=,"Had ask’d again, and ever loved to hear;"
2920,=ENID.=,So grateful is the noise of noble deeds
2921,=ENID.=,To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:
2922,=ENID.=,"Oh, never yet had woman such a pair"
2923,=ENID.=,"Of suitors as this maiden; first Limours,          440"
2924,=ENID.=,"A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,"
2925,=ENID.=,Drunk even when he woo’d; and be he dead
2926,=ENID.=,"I know not, but he pass’d to the wild land."
2927,=ENID.=,"The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,"
2928,=ENID.=,"My curse, my nephew—I will not let his name          445"
2929,=ENID.=,"Slip from my lips if I can help it—he,"
2930,=ENID.=,When I that knew him fierce and turbulent
2931,=ENID.=,"Refused her to him, then his pride awoke"
2932,=ENID.=,"And since the proud man often is the mean,"
2933,=ENID.=,He sow’d a slander in the common ear          450
2934,=ENID.=,"Affirming that his father left him gold,"
2935,=ENID.=,"And in my charge, which was not render’d to him;"
2936,=ENID.=,Bribed with large promises the men who serv’d
2937,=ENID.=,"About my person, the more easily"
2938,=ENID.=,Because my means were somewhat broken into          455
2939,=ENID.=,Through open doors and hospitality;
2940,=ENID.=,Rais’d my own town against me in the night
2941,=ENID.=,"Before my Enid’s birthday, sack’d my house;"
2942,=ENID.=,From mine own earldom foully ousted me;
2943,=ENID.=,"Built that new fort to overawe my friends,          460"
2944,=ENID.=,For truly there are those who love me yet;
2945,=ENID.=,"And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,"
2946,=ENID.=,"Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,"
2947,=ENID.=,But that his pride too much despises me:
2948,=ENID.=,And I myself sometimes despise myself;          465
2949,=ENID.=,"For I have let men be, and have their way;"
2950,=ENID.=,"Am much too gentle, have not used my power:"
2951,=ENID.=,Nor know I whether I be very base
2952,=ENID.=,"Or very manful, whether very wise"
2953,=ENID.=,"Or very foolish; only this I know,          470"
2954,=ENID.=,"That whatsoever evil happen to me,"
2955,=ENID.=,"I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,"
2956,=ENID.=,But can endure it all most patiently.”
2957,=ENID.=,
2958,=ENID.=,"“Well said, true heart,” replied Geraint, “but arms,"
2959,=ENID.=,"That if, as I suppose, your nephew fights          475"
2960,=ENID.=,In next day’s tourney I may break his pride.”
2961,=ENID.=,
2962,=ENID.=,"And Yniol answer’d, “Arms, indeed, but old"
2963,=ENID.=,"And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,"
2964,=ENID.=,"Are mine, and therefore at your asking, yours."
2965,=ENID.=,"But in this tournament can no man tilt,          480"
2966,=ENID.=,Except the lady he loves best be there.
2967,=ENID.=,"Two forks are fix’d into the meadow ground,"
2968,=ENID.=,"And over these is laid a silver wand,"
2969,=ENID.=,"And over that is placed a sparrow-hawk,"
2970,=ENID.=,The prize of beauty for the fairest there.          485
2971,=ENID.=,"And this, what knight soever be in field"
2972,=ENID.=,"Lays claim to for the lady at his side,"
2973,=ENID.=,"And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,"
2974,=ENID.=,Who being apt at arms and big of bone
2975,=ENID.=,"Has ever won it for the lady with him,          490"
2976,=ENID.=,And toppling over all antagonism
2977,=ENID.=,Has earn’d himself the name of sparrow-hawk.
2978,=ENID.=,"But you, that have no lady, cannot fight.”"
2979,=ENID.=,
2980,=ENID.=,"To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,"
2981,=ENID.=,"Leaning a little toward him, “Your leave!          495"
2982,=ENID.=,"Let _me_ lay lance in rest, O noble host,"
2983,=ENID.=,"For this dear child, because I never saw,"
2984,=ENID.=,"Though having seen all beauties of our time,"
2985,=ENID.=,"Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair."
2986,=ENID.=,And if I fall her name will yet remain          500
2987,=ENID.=,"Untarnish’d as before; but if I live,"
2988,=ENID.=,"So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,"
2989,=ENID.=,As I will make her truly my true wife.”
2990,=ENID.=,
2991,=ENID.=,"Then, howsoever patient, Yniol’s heart"
2992,=ENID.=,"Danced in his bosom, seeing better days.          505"
2993,=ENID.=,And looking round he saw not Enid there
2994,=ENID.=,"(Who hearing her own name had slipt away),"
2995,=ENID.=,"But that old dame, to whom full tenderly"
2996,=ENID.=,"And fondling all her hand in his he said,"
2997,=ENID.=,"“Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,          510"
2998,=ENID.=,And best by her that bore her understood.
2999,=ENID.=,"Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest"
3000,=ENID.=,"Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.”"
3001,=ENID.=,
3002,=ENID.=,"So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she"
3003,=ENID.=,"With frequent smile and nod departing found,          515"
3004,=ENID.=,"Half-disarray’d as to her rest, the girl;"
3005,=ENID.=,"Whom first she kiss’d on either cheek, and then"
3006,=ENID.=,"On either shining shoulder laid a hand,"
3007,=ENID.=,"And kept her off and gazed upon her face,"
3008,=ENID.=,"And told her all their converse in the hall,          520"
3009,=ENID.=,Proving her heart: but never light and shade
3010,=ENID.=,Coursed one another more on open ground
3011,=ENID.=,"Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale"
3012,=ENID.=,Across the face of Enid hearing her;
3013,=ENID.=,"While slowly falling as a scale that falls,          525"
3014,=ENID.=,"When weight is added only grain by grain,"
3015,=ENID.=,Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;
3016,=ENID.=,"Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,"
3017,=ENID.=,Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it.
3018,=ENID.=,So moving without answer to her rest          530
3019,=ENID.=,"She found no rest, and ever fail’d to draw"
3020,=ENID.=,"The quiet night into her blood, but lay"
3021,=ENID.=,Contemplating her own unworthiness;
3022,=ENID.=,And when the pale and bloodless east began
3023,=ENID.=,"To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised          535"
3024,=ENID.=,"Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved"
3025,=ENID.=,"Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,"
3026,=ENID.=,And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.
3027,=ENID.=,
3028,=ENID.=,"And thither came the twain, and when Geraint"
3029,=ENID.=,"Beheld her first in field awaiting him,          540"
3030,=ENID.=,"He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,"
3031,=ENID.=,Himself beyond the rest pushing could move
3032,=ENID.=,The chair of Idris. Yniol’s rusted arms
3033,=ENID.=,"Were on his princely person, but through these"
3034,=ENID.=,Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights          545
3035,=ENID.=,"And ladies came, and by and by the town"
3036,=ENID.=,"Flow’d in, and settling circled all the lists."
3037,=ENID.=,"And there they fix’d the forks into the ground,"
3038,=ENID.=,"And over these they placed a silver wand,"
3039,=ENID.=,And over that a golden sparrow-hawk.          550
3040,=ENID.=,"Then Yniol’s nephew, after trumpet blown,"
3041,=ENID.=,"Spake to the lady with him and proclaim’d,"
3042,=ENID.=,"“Advance and take as fairest of the fair,"
3043,=ENID.=,"For I these two years past have won it for thee,"
3044,=ENID.=,"The prize of beauty.” Loudly spake the Prince,          555"
3045,=ENID.=,"“Forbear; there is a worthier,” and the knight,"
3046,=ENID.=,"With some surprise and thrice as much disdain,"
3047,=ENID.=,"Turn’d, and beheld the four, and all his face"
3048,=ENID.=,"Glow’d like the heart of a great fire at Yule,"
3049,=ENID.=,"So burnt he was with passion, crying out,          560"
3050,=ENID.=,"“Do battle for it then,” no more; and thrice"
3051,=ENID.=,"They clash’d together, and thrice they brake their spears."
3052,=ENID.=,"Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lash’d at each"
3053,=ENID.=,"So often and with such blows, that all the crowd"
3054,=ENID.=,"Wonder’d, and now and then from distant walls          565"
3055,=ENID.=,There came a clapping as of phantom hands.
3056,=ENID.=,"So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still"
3057,=ENID.=,"The dew of their great labour, and the blood"
3058,=ENID.=,"Of their strong bodies, flowing, drain’d their force."
3059,=ENID.=,"But either’s force was match’d till Yniol’s cry,          570"
3060,=ENID.=,"“Remember that great insult done the Queen,”"
3061,=ENID.=,"Increased Geraint’s, who heaved his blade aloft,"
3062,=ENID.=,"And crack’d the helmet through, and bit the bone,"
3063,=ENID.=,"And fell’d him, and set foot upon his breast,"
3064,=ENID.=,"And said, “Thy name?” To whom the fallen man          575"
3065,=ENID.=,"Made answer, groaning, “Edyrn, son of Nudd!"
3066,=ENID.=,Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.
3067,=ENID.=,My pride is broken: men have seen my fall.”
3068,=ENID.=,"“Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,” replied Geraint,"
3069,=ENID.=,"“These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.          580"
3070,=ENID.=,"First, thou thyself, thy lady, and thy dwarf,"
3071,=ENID.=,"Shalt ride to Arthur’s court, and being there,"
3072,=ENID.=,"Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,"
3073,=ENID.=,"And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,"
3074,=ENID.=,Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.          585
3075,=ENID.=,"These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.”"
3076,=ENID.=,"And Edyrn answer’d, “These things will I do,"
3077,=ENID.=,"For I have never yet been overthrown,"
3078,=ENID.=,"And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride"
3079,=ENID.=,"Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!”          590"
3080,=ENID.=,"And rising up, he rode to Arthur’s court,"
3081,=ENID.=,And there the Queen forgave him easily.
3082,=ENID.=,"And being young, he changed himself, and grew"
3083,=ENID.=,To hate the sin that seem’d so like his own
3084,=ENID.=,"Of Modred, Arthur’s nephew, and fell at last          595"
3085,=ENID.=,In the great battle fighting for the King.
3086,=ENID.=,
3087,=ENID.=,But when the third day from the hunting-morn
3088,=ENID.=,"Made a low splendour in the world, and wings"
3089,=ENID.=,"Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay"
3090,=ENID.=,"With her fair head in the dim yellow light,          600"
3091,=ENID.=,"Among the dancing shadows of the birds,"
3092,=ENID.=,Woke and bethought her of her promise given
3093,=ENID.=,No later than last eve to Prince Geraint—
3094,=ENID.=,"So bent he seem’d on going the third day,"
3095,=ENID.=,"He would not leave her, till her promise given—          605"
3096,=ENID.=,"To ride with him this morning to the court,"
3097,=ENID.=,"And there be made known to the stately Queen,"
3098,=ENID.=,And there be wedded with all ceremony.
3099,=ENID.=,"At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,"
3100,=ENID.=,And thought it never yet had look’d so mean.          610
3101,=ENID.=,For as a leaf in mid-November is
3102,=ENID.=,"To what it was in mid-October, seem’d"
3103,=ENID.=,The dress that now she look’d on to the dress
3104,=ENID.=,She look’d on ere the coming of Geraint.
3105,=ENID.=,"And still she look’d, and still the terror grew          615"
3106,=ENID.=,"Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,"
3107,=ENID.=,All staring at her in her faded silk;
3108,=ENID.=,And softly to her own sweet heart she said;
3109,=ENID.=,
3110,=ENID.=,"“This noble prince who won our earldom back,"
3111,=ENID.=,"So splendid in his acts and his attire,          620"
3112,=ENID.=,"Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!"
3113,=ENID.=,"Would he could tarry with us here awhile,"
3114,=ENID.=,"But being so beholden to the Prince,"
3115,=ENID.=,"It were but little grace in any of us,"
3116,=ENID.=,"Bent as he seem’d on going this third day,          625"
3117,=ENID.=,To seek a second favour at his hands.
3118,=ENID.=,"Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,"
3119,=ENID.=,"Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,"
3120,=ENID.=,Far liefer than so much discredit him.”
3121,=ENID.=,
3122,=ENID.=,And Enid fell in longing for a dress          630
3123,=ENID.=,"All branch’d and flower’d with gold, a costly gift"
3124,=ENID.=,"Of her good mother, given her on the night"
3125,=ENID.=,"Before her birthday, three sad years ago,"
3126,=ENID.=,"That night of fire, when Edyrn sack’d their house,"
3127,=ENID.=,And scatter’d all they had to all the winds:          635
3128,=ENID.=,"For while the mother show’d it, and the two"
3129,=ENID.=,"Were turning and admiring it, the work"
3130,=ENID.=,"To both appear’d so costly, rose a cry"
3131,=ENID.=,"That Edyrn’s men were on them, and they fled"
3132,=ENID.=,"With little save the jewels they had on,          640"
3133,=ENID.=,Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:
3134,=ENID.=,"And Edyrn’s men had caught them in their flight,"
3135,=ENID.=,And placed them in this ruin; and she wish’d
3136,=ENID.=,The Prince had found her in her ancient home;
3137,=ENID.=,"Then let her fancy flit across the past,          645"
3138,=ENID.=,And roam the goodly places that she knew;
3139,=ENID.=,"And last bethought her how she used to watch,"
3140,=ENID.=,"Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;"
3141,=ENID.=,And one was patch’d and blurr’d and lustreless
3142,=ENID.=,Among his burnish’d brethren of the pool;          650
3143,=ENID.=,And half asleep she made comparison
3144,=ENID.=,Of that and these to her own faded self
3145,=ENID.=,"And the gay court, and fell asleep again;"
3146,=ENID.=,And dreamt herself was such a faded form
3147,=ENID.=,Among her burnish’d sisters of the pool;          655
3148,=ENID.=,But this was in the garden of a king;
3149,=ENID.=,"And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew"
3150,=ENID.=,That all was bright; that all about were birds
3151,=ENID.=,Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;
3152,=ENID.=,That all the turf was rich in plots that look’d          660
3153,=ENID.=,Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;
3154,=ENID.=,And lords and ladies of the high court went
3155,=ENID.=,In silver tissue talking things of state;
3156,=ENID.=,And children of the King in cloth of gold
3157,=ENID.=,Glanced at the doors or gamboll’d down the walks;          665
3158,=ENID.=,"And while she thought, “They will not see me,” came"
3159,=ENID.=,"A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,"
3160,=ENID.=,And all the children in their cloth of gold
3161,=ENID.=,"Ran to her, crying, “If we have fish at all"
3162,=ENID.=,Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now          670
3163,=ENID.=,To pick the faded creature from the pool.
3164,=ENID.=,And cast it on the mixen that it die.”
3165,=ENID.=,"And therewithal one came and seized on her,"
3166,=ENID.=,"And Enid started, waking, with her heart"
3167,=ENID.=,"All overshadow’d by the foolish dream,          675"
3168,=ENID.=,And lo! it was her mother grasping her
3169,=ENID.=,To get her well awake: and in her hand
3170,=ENID.=,"A suit of bright apparel, which she laid"
3171,=ENID.=,"Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:"
3172,=ENID.=,
3173,=ENID.=,"“See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,          680"
3174,=ENID.=,How fast they hold like colours of a shell
3175,=ENID.=,That keeps the wear and polish of the wave!
3176,=ENID.=,"Why not? It never yet was worn, I trow:"
3177,=ENID.=,"Look on it, child, and tell me if you know it.”"
3178,=ENID.=,
3179,=ENID.=,"And Enid look’d, but all confus’d at first,          685"
3180,=ENID.=,Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream;
3181,=ENID.=,"Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,"
3182,=ENID.=,"And answer’d, “Yea, I know it; your good gift,"
3183,=ENID.=,So sadly lost on that unhappy night;
3184,=ENID.=,"Your own good gift!” “Yea, surely,” said the dame,          690"
3185,=ENID.=,“And gladly given again this happy morn.
3186,=ENID.=,"For when the jousts were ended yesterday,"
3187,=ENID.=,"Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere"
3188,=ENID.=,He found the sack and plunder of our house
3189,=ENID.=,All scatter’d through the houses of the town;          695
3190,=ENID.=,And gave command that all which once was ours
3191,=ENID.=,"Should now be ours again: and yester-eve,"
3192,=ENID.=,"While you were talking sweetly with your Prince,"
3193,=ENID.=,"Came one with this and laid it in my hand,"
3194,=ENID.=,"For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,          700"
3195,=ENID.=,Because we have our Earldom back again.
3196,=ENID.=,"And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,"
3197,=ENID.=,But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.
3198,=ENID.=,"Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?"
3199,=ENID.=,For I myself unwillingly have worn          705
3200,=ENID.=,"My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,"
3201,=ENID.=,"And howsoever patient, Yniol his."
3202,=ENID.=,"Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,"
3203,=ENID.=,"With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,"
3204,=ENID.=,"And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,          710"
3205,=ENID.=,"And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all"
3206,=ENID.=,That appertains to noble maintenance.
3207,=ENID.=,"Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;"
3208,=ENID.=,"But since our fortune slipt from sun to shade,"
3209,=ENID.=,"And all through that young traitor, cruel need          715"
3210,=ENID.=,"Constrain’d us, but a better time has come;"
3211,=ENID.=,"So clothe yourself in this, that better fits"
3212,=ENID.=,Our mended fortunes and a Prince’s bride:
3213,=ENID.=,"For though you won the prize of fairest fair,"
3214,=ENID.=,"And though I heard him call you fairest fair,          720"
3215,=ENID.=,"Let never maiden think, however fair,"
3216,=ENID.=,She is not fairer in new clothes than old.
3217,=ENID.=,"And should some great court-lady say, the Prince"
3218,=ENID.=,"Hath pick’d a ragged-robin from the hedge,"
3219,=ENID.=,"And like a madman brought her to the court,          725"
3220,=ENID.=,"Then were you shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince"
3221,=ENID.=,"To whom we are beholden; but I know,"
3222,=ENID.=,"When my dear child is set forth at her best,"
3223,=ENID.=,"That neither court nor country, though they sought"
3224,=ENID.=,Through all the provinces like those of old          730
3225,=ENID.=,"That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.”"
3226,=ENID.=,
3227,=ENID.=,Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;
3228,=ENID.=,And Enid listen’d brightening as she lay;
3229,=ENID.=,"Then, as the white and glittering star of morn"
3230,=ENID.=,"Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by          735"
3231,=ENID.=,"Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,"
3232,=ENID.=,"And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,"
3233,=ENID.=,"Help’d by the mother’s careful hand and eye,"
3234,=ENID.=,"Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;"
3235,=ENID.=,"Who, after, turn’d her daughter round and said,          740"
3236,=ENID.=,She never yet had seen her half so fair;
3237,=ENID.=,"And call’d her like that maiden in the tale,"
3238,=ENID.=,"Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers,"
3239,=ENID.=,"And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,"
3240,=ENID.=,"Flur, for whose love the Roman Cæsar first          745"
3241,=ENID.=,"Invaded Britain, “But we beat him back,"
3242,=ENID.=,"As this great Prince invaded us, and we,"
3243,=ENID.=,"Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy."
3244,=ENID.=,"And I can scarcely ride with you to court,"
3245,=ENID.=,"For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;          750"
3246,=ENID.=,"But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream"
3247,=ENID.=,"I see my princess as I see her now,"
3248,=ENID.=,"Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.”"
3249,=ENID.=,
3250,=ENID.=,"But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint"
3251,=ENID.=,"Woke where he slept in the high hall, and call’d          755"
3252,=ENID.=,For Enid; and when Yniol made report
3253,=ENID.=,Of that good mother making Enid gay
3254,=ENID.=,In such apparel as might well beseem
3255,=ENID.=,"His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,"
3256,=ENID.=,"He answer’d: “Earl, entreat her by my love,          760"
3257,=ENID.=,"Albeit I give no reason but my wish,"
3258,=ENID.=,That she ride with me in her faded silk.”
3259,=ENID.=,Yniol with that hard message went; it fell
3260,=ENID.=,Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:
3261,=ENID.=,"For Enid, all abash’d she knew not why,          765"
3262,=ENID.=,"Dared not to glance at her good mother’s face,"
3263,=ENID.=,"But silently, in all obedience,"
3264,=ENID.=,"Her mother silent too, nor helping her,"
3265,=ENID.=,"Laid from her limbs the costly-broider’d gift,"
3266,=ENID.=,"And robed them in her ancient suit again,          770"
3267,=ENID.=,And so descended. Never man rejoiced
3268,=ENID.=,More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;
3269,=ENID.=,And glancing all at once as keenly at her
3270,=ENID.=,"As careful robins eye the delver’s toil,"
3271,=ENID.=,"Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,          775"
3272,=ENID.=,But rested with her sweet face satisfied;
3273,=ENID.=,"Then seeing cloud upon the mother’s brow,"
3274,=ENID.=,"Her by both hands he caught, and sweetly said:"
3275,=ENID.=,
3276,=ENID.=,"“O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved"
3277,=ENID.=,"At your new son, for my petition to her.          780"
3278,=ENID.=,"When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,"
3279,=ENID.=,"In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,"
3280,=ENID.=,"Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,"
3281,=ENID.=,Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.
3282,=ENID.=,"Thereafter, when I reach’d this ruin’d hold,          785"
3283,=ENID.=,"Beholding one so bright in dark estate,"
3284,=ENID.=,"I vow’d that could I gain her, our kind Queen,"
3285,=ENID.=,"No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst"
3286,=ENID.=,"Sunlike from cloud—and likewise thought, perhaps,"
3287,=ENID.=,That service done so graciously would bind          790
3288,=ENID.=,The two together; for I wish the two
3289,=ENID.=,To love each other: how should Enid find
3290,=ENID.=,A nobler friend? Another thought I had;
3291,=ENID.=,"I came among you here so suddenly,"
3292,=ENID.=,That though her gentle presence at the lists          795
3293,=ENID.=,"Might well have served for proof that I was loved,"
3294,=ENID.=,"I doubted whether filial tenderness,"
3295,=ENID.=,"Or easy nature, did not let itself"
3296,=ENID.=,Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;
3297,=ENID.=,Or whether some false sense in her own self          800
3298,=ENID.=,"Of my contrasting brightness, overbore"
3299,=ENID.=,Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;
3300,=ENID.=,And such a sense might make her long for court
3301,=ENID.=,"And all its dangerous glories: and I thought,"
3302,=ENID.=,That could I someway prove such force in her          805
3303,=ENID.=,"Link’d with such love for me, that at a word"
3304,=ENID.=,(No reason given her) she could cast aside
3305,=ENID.=,"A splendour dear to women, new to her,"
3306,=ENID.=,"And therefore dearer; or if not so new,"
3307,=ENID.=,Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power          810
3308,=ENID.=,Of intermitted custom; then I felt
3309,=ENID.=,"That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,"
3310,=ENID.=,"Fix’d on her faith. Now, therefore, I do rest,"
3311,=ENID.=,"A prophet certain of my prophecy,"
3312,=ENID.=,That never shadow of mistrust can cross          815
3313,=ENID.=,Between us. Grant me pardon for my thoughts;
3314,=ENID.=,And for my strange petition I will make
3315,=ENID.=,"Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,"
3316,=ENID.=,When your fair child shall wear your costly gift
3317,=ENID.=,"Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,          820"
3318,=ENID.=,"Who knows? another gift of the high God,"
3319,=ENID.=,"Which, maybe, shall have learn’d to lisp you thanks.”"
3320,=ENID.=,
3321,=ENID.=,"He spoke: the mother smil’d, but half in tears,"
3322,=ENID.=,"Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,"
3323,=ENID.=,"And claspt and kiss’d her, and they rode away.          825"
3324,=ENID.=,
3325,=ENID.=,Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climb’d
3326,=ENID.=,"The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,"
3327,=ENID.=,"Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,"
3328,=ENID.=,And white sails flying on the yellow sea;
3329,=ENID.=,But not to goodly hill or yellow sea          830
3330,=ENID.=,"Look’d the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,"
3331,=ENID.=,"By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;"
3332,=ENID.=,"And then descending met them at the gates,"
3333,=ENID.=,"Embrac’d her with all welcome as a friend,"
3334,=ENID.=,"And did her honour as the Prince’s bride,          835"
3335,=ENID.=,And cloth’d her for her bridals like the sun;
3336,=ENID.=,"And all that week was old Caerleon gay,"
3337,=ENID.=,"For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,"
3338,=ENID.=,They twain were wedded with all ceremony.
3339,=ENID.=,
3340,=ENID.=,And this was on the last year’s Whitsuntide.          840
3341,=ENID.=,"But Enid ever kept the faded silk,"
3342,=ENID.=,"Remembering how first he came on her,"
3343,=ENID.=,"Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,"

4128,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"That shades the steep, and sighs at every blast."
4129,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4130,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Far to the right, where Apennine ascends,          105"
4131,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Bright as the summer, Italy extends;"
4132,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Its uplands sloping deck the mountain’s side,"
4133,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Woods over woods in gay theatric pride;
4134,=THE TRAVELLER.=,While oft some temple’s mouldering tops between
4135,=THE TRAVELLER.=,With venerable grandeur mark the scene.          110
4136,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4137,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Could nature’s bounty satisfy the breast,"
4138,=THE TRAVELLER.=,The sons of Italy were surely blest.
4139,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Whatever fruits in different climes are found,"
4140,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground;"
4141,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,          115"
4142,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Whose bright succession decks the varied year;
4143,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Whatever sweets salute the northern sky
4144,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"With vernal lives, that blossom but to die;"
4145,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"These, here disporting, own the kindred soil,"
4146,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Nor ask luxuriance from the planter’s toil;          120
4147,=THE TRAVELLER.=,While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand
4148,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.
4149,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4150,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,"
4151,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And sensual bliss is all this nation knows.
4152,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"In florid beauty groves and fields appear,          125"
4153,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Man seems the only growth that dwindles here.
4154,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Contrasted faults through all his manners reign:
4155,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Though poor, luxurious; though submissive, vain;"
4156,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Though grave, yet trifling; zealous, yet untrue;"
4157,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And even in penance planning sins anew.          130
4158,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"All evils here contaminate the mind,"
4159,=THE TRAVELLER.=,That opulence departed leaves behind;
4160,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"For wealth was theirs, not far remov’d the date,"
4161,=THE TRAVELLER.=,When commerce proudly flourished through the state.
4162,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"At her command the palace learnt to rise,          135"
4163,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Again the long-fallen column sought the skies;
4164,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The canvas glow’d beyond ev’n nature warm,"
4165,=THE TRAVELLER.=,The pregnant quarry teem’d with human form;
4166,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Till, more unsteady than the southern gale,"
4167,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Commerce on other shores display’d her sail;          140
4168,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"While nought remain’d of all that riches gave,"
4169,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But towns unmann’d, and lords without a slave:"
4170,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And late the nation found, with fruitless skill,"
4171,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Its former strength was but plethoric ill.
4172,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4173,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied          145
4174,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"By arts, the splendid wrecks of former pride;"
4175,=THE TRAVELLER.=,From these the feeble heart and long-fallen mind
4176,=THE TRAVELLER.=,An easy compensation seem to find.
4177,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array’d,"
4178,=THE TRAVELLER.=,The pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade;          150
4179,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Processions form’d for piety and love,"
4180,=THE TRAVELLER.=,A mistress or a saint in every grove.
4181,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"By sports like these are all their cares beguil’d,"
4182,=THE TRAVELLER.=,The sports of children satisfy the child;
4183,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Each nobler aim, represt by long control,          155"
4184,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Now sinks at last, or feebly mans the soul;"
4185,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"While low delights, succeeding fast behind,"
4186,=THE TRAVELLER.=,In happier meanness occupy the mind.
4187,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"As in those domes where Cæsars once bore sway,"
4188,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Defac’d by time and tottering in decay,          160"
4189,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,"
4190,=THE TRAVELLER.=,The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed;
4191,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And, wondering man could want the larger pile,"
4192,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile."
4193,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4194,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"My soul, turn from them; turn we to survey          165"
4195,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Where rougher climes a nobler race display;
4196,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansion tread,"
4197,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And force a churlish soil for scanty bread.
4198,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"No product here the barren hills afford,"
4199,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But man and steel, the soldier and his sword;          170"
4200,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,"
4201,=THE TRAVELLER.=,But winter lingering chills the lap of May;
4202,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"No zephyr fondly sues the mountain’s breast,"
4203,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But meteors glare, and stormy glooms invest."
4204,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4205,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Yet still, even here, content can spread a charm,          175"
4206,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm."
4207,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Though poor the peasant’s hut, his feasts though small,"
4208,=THE TRAVELLER.=,He sees his little lot the lot of all;
4209,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Sees no contiguous palace rear its head
4210,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To shame the meanness of his humble shed;          180
4211,=THE TRAVELLER.=,No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal
4212,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To make him loathe his vegetable meal;
4213,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,"
4214,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil."
4215,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Cheerful, at morn, he wakes from short repose,          185"
4216,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Breasts the keen air, and carols as he goes;"
4217,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"With patient angle trolls the finny deep,"
4218,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Or drives his venturous plowshare to the steep;
4219,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way,"
4220,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And drags the struggling savage into day.          190
4221,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"At night returning, every labour sped,"
4222,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"He sits him down, the monarch of a shed;"
4223,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys"
4224,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"His children’s looks, that brighten at the blaze,"
4225,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"While his lov’d partner, boastful of her hoard,          195"
4226,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Displays her cleanly platter on the board;
4227,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,"
4228,=THE TRAVELLER.=,With many a tale repays the nightly bed.
4229,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4230,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Thus every good his native wilds impart,"
4231,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Imprints the patriot passion on his heart;          200
4232,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And ev’n those hills that round his mansion rise
4233,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies.
4234,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,"
4235,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms:
4236,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,          205"
4237,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Clings close and closer to the mother’s breast,"
4238,=THE TRAVELLER.=,So the loud torrent and the whirlwind’s roar
4239,=THE TRAVELLER.=,But bind him to his native mountains more.
4240,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4241,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Such are the charms to barren states assign’d:
4242,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Their wants but few, their wishes all confin’d.          210"
4243,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Yet let them only share the praises due;
4244,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"If few their wants, their pleasures are but few;"
4245,=THE TRAVELLER.=,For every want that stimulates the breast
4246,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest.
4247,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies,          215"
4248,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"That first excites desire, and then supplies;"
4249,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,"
4250,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To fill the languid pause with finer joy;
4251,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame
4252,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame:          220"
4253,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Their level life is but a smouldering fire,"
4254,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Unquench’d by want, unfann’d by strong desire;"
4255,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer"
4256,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"On some high festival of once a year,"
4257,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,          225"
4258,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Till, buried in debauch, the bliss expire."
4259,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4260,=THE TRAVELLER.=,But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow;
4261,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Their morals, like their pleasures, are but low."
4262,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"For, as refinement stops, from sire to son,"
4263,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Unalter’d, unimprov’d, the manners run;          230"
4264,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And love’s and friendship’s finely pointed dart
4265,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Fall blunted from each indurated heart.
4266,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Some sterner virtues o’er the mountain’s breast
4267,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"May sit, like falcons cowering on the nest;"
4268,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But all the gentler morals, such as play          235"
4269,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Through life’s more cultur’d walks, and charm the way,—"
4270,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"These, far dispers’d, on timorous pinions fly,"
4271,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.
4272,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4273,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,"
4274,=THE TRAVELLER.=,I turn; and France displays her bright domain.          240
4275,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,"
4276,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Pleas’d with thyself, whom all the world can please,"
4277,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"How often have I led thy sportive choir,"
4278,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire!"
4279,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Where shading elms along the margin grew,          245"
4280,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And freshen’d from the wave the zephyr flew;
4281,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And haply, though my harsh touch, faltering still,"
4282,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But mock’d all tune, and marr’d the dancer’s skill,"
4283,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,"
4284,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And dance, forgetful of the noontide hour.          250"
4285,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Alike all ages: dames of ancient days
4286,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Have led their children through the mirthful maze;
4287,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And the gay grandsire, skill’d in gestic lore,"
4288,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Has frisk’d beneath the burthen of threescore.
4289,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4290,=THE TRAVELLER.=,So blest a life these thoughtless realms display;          255
4291,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Thus idly busy rolls their world away.
4292,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,"
4293,=THE TRAVELLER.=,For honour forms the social temper here:
4294,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Honour, that praise which real merit gains,"
4295,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Or even imaginary worth obtains,          260"
4296,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,"
4297,=THE TRAVELLER.=,It shifts in splendid traffic round the land;
4298,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"From courts, to camps, to cottages it strays,"
4299,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And all are taught an avarice of praise.
4300,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"They please, are pleas’d; they give to get esteem,          265"
4301,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Till, seeming blest, they grow to what they seem."
4302,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4303,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But while this softer art their bliss supplies,"
4304,=THE TRAVELLER.=,It gives their follies also room to rise;
4305,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"For praise too dearly lov’d, or warmly sought"
4306,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Enfeebles all internal strength of thought:          270
4307,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And the weak soul, within itself unblest,"
4308,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Leans for all pleasure on another’s breast.
4309,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,"
4310,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;
4311,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,          275"
4312,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace;
4313,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,"
4314,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To boast one splendid banquet once a year:
4315,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,"
4316,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause.          280
4317,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4318,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"To men of other minds my fancy flies,"
4319,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Embosom’d in the deep where Holland lies.
4320,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Methinks her patient sons before me stand,"
4321,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Where the broad ocean leans against the land,"
4322,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,          285"
4323,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Lift the tall rampire’s artificial pride.
4324,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Onward methinks, and diligently slow,"
4325,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The firm connected bulwark seems to grow,"
4326,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Spreads its long arms amidst the watery roar,"
4327,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore.          290"
4328,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"While the pent ocean, rising o’er the pile,"
4329,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile:
4330,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The slow canal, the yellow-blossom’d vale,"
4331,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,"
4332,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The crowded mart, the cultivated plain,—          295"
4333,=THE TRAVELLER.=,A new creation rescued from his reign.
4334,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4335,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Thus, while around the wave-subjected soil"
4336,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Impels the native to repeated toil,"
4337,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Industrious habits in each bosom reign,"
4338,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And industry begets a love of gain.          300
4339,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Hence all the good from opulence that springs,"
4340,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"With all those ills superfluous treasure brings,"
4341,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Are here display’d. Their much lov’d wealth imparts
4342,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Convenience, plenty, elegance, and arts;"
4343,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But, view them closer, craft and fraud appear;          305"
4344,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Even liberty itself is bartered here.
4345,=THE TRAVELLER.=,At gold’s superior charms all freedom flies;
4346,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The needy sell it, and the rich man buys."
4347,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,"
4348,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Here wretches seek dishonorable graves,          310"
4349,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And calmly bent, to servitude conform,"
4350,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm.
4351,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4352,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Heavens! how unlike their Belgic sires of old—
4353,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold;"
4354,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"War in each breast, and freedom on each brow;          315"
4355,=THE TRAVELLER.=,How much unlike the sons of Britain now!
4356,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4357,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Fir’d at the sound, my genius spreads her wing,"
4358,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And flies where Britain courts the western spring,"
4359,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride,"
4360,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And brighter streams than fam’d Hydaspes glide.          320
4361,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"There all around the gentlest breezes stray,"
4362,=THE TRAVELLER.=,There gentle music melts on every spray;
4363,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Creation’s mildest charms are there combin’d:
4364,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Extremes are only in the master’s mind!
4365,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Stern o’er each bosom reason holds her state,          325"
4366,=THE TRAVELLER.=,With daring aims irregularly great;
4367,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,"
4368,=THE TRAVELLER.=,I see the lords of human kind pass by;
4369,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,"
4370,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"By forms unfashion’d, fresh from Nature’s hand,          330"
4371,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,"
4372,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"True to imagin’d right, above control;"
4373,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"While e’en the peasant boasts these rights to scan,"
4374,=THE TRAVELLER.=,And learns to venerate himself as man.
4375,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4376,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Thine, Freedom, thine the blessings pictur’d here,          335"
4377,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;
4378,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Too blest, indeed, were such without alloy;"
4379,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But, foster’d e’en by freedom, ills annoy."
4380,=THE TRAVELLER.=,That independence Britons prize too high
4381,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Keeps man from man, and breaks the social tie;          340"
4382,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The self-dependent lordlings stand alone,"
4383,=THE TRAVELLER.=,All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown.
4384,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Here, by the bonds of nature feebly held,"
4385,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Minds combat minds, repelling and repell’d;"
4386,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Ferments arise, imprison’d factions roar,          345"
4387,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Represt ambition struggles round her shore;
4388,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Till, over-wrought, the general system feels"
4389,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Its motions stop, or frenzy fire the wheels."
4390,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4391,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Nor this the worst. As nature’s ties decay,"
4392,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"As duty, love, and honour fail to sway,          350"
4393,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,"
4394,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Still gather strength, and force unwilling awe."
4395,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Hence all obedience bows to these alone,"
4396,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And talent sinks, and merit weeps unknown;"
4397,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Till time may come, when, stript of all her charms,          355"
4398,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The land of scholars, and the nurse of arms,"
4399,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame,"
4400,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Where kings have toil’d and poets wrote for fame,"
4401,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"One sink of level avarice shall lie,"
4402,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And scholars, soldiers, kings, unhonour’d die.          360"
4403,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4404,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Yet think not, thus when Freedom’s ills I state,"
4405,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"I mean to flatter kings, or court the great:"
4406,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Ye powers of truth, that bid my soul aspire,"
4407,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Far from my bosom drive the low desire;
4408,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And thou, fair Freedom, taught alike to feel          365"
4409,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The rabble’s rage, and tyrant’s angry steel;"
4410,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Thou transitory flower, alike undone"
4411,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"By proud contempt, or favour’s fostering sun,"
4412,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure!
4413,=THE TRAVELLER.=,I only would repress them to secure:          370
4414,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"For just experience tells in every soil,"
4415,=THE TRAVELLER.=,That those who think must govern those who toil;
4416,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"And all that Freedom’s highest aims can reach,"
4417,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Is but to lay proportion’d loads on each.
4418,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Hence, should one order disproportioned grow,          375"
4419,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Its double weight must ruin all below.
4420,=THE TRAVELLER.=,
4421,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Oh, then how blind to all that truth requires,"
4422,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Who think it freedom when a part aspires!
4423,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Calm is my soul, nor apt to rise in arms,"
4424,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Except when fast approaching danger warms:          380
4425,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"But when contending chiefs blockade the throne,"
4426,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Contracting regal power to stretch their own;
4427,=THE TRAVELLER.=,When I behold a factious band agree
4428,=THE TRAVELLER.=,To call it freedom when themselves are free;
4429,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw,          385"
4430,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law;"
4431,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"The wealth of climes where savage nations roam,"
4432,=THE TRAVELLER.=,Pillag’d from slaves to purchase slaves at home;
4433,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Fear, pity, justice, indignation, start,"
4434,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Tear off reserve, and bare my swelling heart;          390"
4435,=THE TRAVELLER.=,"Till, half a patriot, half a coward grown,"
4436,=THE TRAVELLER.=,I fly from petty tyrants to the throne.
4437,=THE TRAVELLER.=,

5198,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,_Morte D’Arthur_ (The Death of Arthur) is a story of King Arthur and
5199,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"The Round Table, based on the legend entitled _Morte D’Arthur_, which"
5200,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"was written by Malory, an English writer of the sixteenth century. King"
5201,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,Arthur was a mythical king of the Britons who was supposed to have lived
5202,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"and reigned in the sixth century, and to have united the Britons against"
5203,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,the Saxon invaders. According to legend he established a famous order of
5204,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"knighthood known as The Order of The Round Table, so called because of"
5205,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"the famous round table, presented to King Arthur by a British king, and"
5206,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,capable of seating one hundred and fifty knights. In the course of time
5207,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"the knights of the Round Table became corrupt and forgot their vows,"
5208,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"and, led by Modred, the king’s nephew, a number of them rose in"
5209,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,rebellion against the king. King Arthur with those knights who remained
5210,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"loyal to him, drove the army of Modred step by step back into Cornwall"
5211,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"and beyond it into the land of Lyonnesse, which was said to have"
5212,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"extended from Cornwall to the Scilly Isles, but which has since been"
5213,MORTE D’ARTHUR.,"submerged by the sea. Here in this waste land a great battle was fought,"

5842,ENID.,"yet seen the king, fell in love with Lancelot, and her love was"
5843,ENID.,"returned. This secret love was continued, and under its influence,"
5844,ENID.,"little by little, the ideals of the knights were lowered. The incidents"

6153,THE DAY DREAM.,
6154,THE DAY DREAM.,In _The Day Dream_ Tennyson has elaborated in poetical form a series
6155,THE DAY DREAM.,of scenes from the well-known fairy tale of _The Sleeping Beauty_ or
6156,THE DAY DREAM.,"_Briar Rose_. In the fairy story, Briar Rose is a beautiful princess who"
6157,THE DAY DREAM.,was fated to fall asleep in her fifteenth year and remain sleeping for a
6158,THE DAY DREAM.,"hundred years. When the princess is overtaken by her long sleep,"
6159,THE DAY DREAM.,everything in the castle falls under the same spell. An impenetrable
6160,THE DAY DREAM.,"hedge of briars grows up about the castle grounds, and all who strive to"
6161,THE DAY DREAM.,"force an entrance perish in the attempt. At length, when the hundred"
6162,THE DAY DREAM.,"years have passed, comes a splendid prince, who hears from an old man"
6163,THE DAY DREAM.,the story of the mysterious castle and the sleeping princess. When he
6164,THE DAY DREAM.,"reaches the hedge he passes easily through, for the briars have turned"
6165,THE DAY DREAM.,"to flowers. At the very moment when he finds the princess, the hundred"
6166,THE DAY DREAM.,"years are completed, and as he kisses her she opens her eyes once more."
6167,THE DAY DREAM.,"When the princess wakes, the whole castle revives, and life goes on"
6168,THE DAY DREAM.,again as it did a hundred years before. The story ends with the marriage
6169,THE DAY DREAM.,of Briar Rose and the prince.
6170,THE DAY DREAM.,
6171,THE DAY DREAM.,The fairy tale in its original form was probably suggested by the
6172,THE DAY DREAM.,"changing seasons. In Winter the earth, the fairy princess, begins her"
6173,THE DAY DREAM.,"long sleep. In the Springtime comes the sun, the fairy prince, and at"
6174,THE DAY DREAM.,the touch of his kiss the earth awakes to new life and beauty.
6175,THE DAY DREAM.,
6176,THE DAY DREAM.,"From the poem as here given, _The Prologue_, _L’Envoi_ and _The"

6178,THE DAY DREAM.,"Lady Flora, that the sight of her beauty as she lay asleep had called to"
6179,THE DAY DREAM.,"his mind an image of The Sleeping Beauty, and that in his “day dream” he"
6180,THE DAY DREAM.,had recalled the old legend. And so as she works at her embroidery he
6181,THE DAY DREAM.,"bids her listen to the story. _L’Envoi_ and _The Epilogue_, written also"
