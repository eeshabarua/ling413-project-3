20,TWO FISHERS,_We are the music-makers
21,TWO FISHERS,"And we are the dreamers of dreams,"
22,TWO FISHERS,Wandering by lone sea-breakers
23,TWO FISHERS,And sitting by desolate streams._

56,TWO FISHERS,
57,TWO FISHERS,"When the War is over, Charley,"
58,TWO FISHERS,We'll go fishing once again.
59,TWO FISHERS,"You'll be a new man, Charley,"
60,TWO FISHERS,When you walk with fishermen.
61,TWO FISHERS,For we'll seek a leaping river
62,TWO FISHERS,I know far among the fells;
63,TWO FISHERS,"You'll forget the War there, Charley,"
64,TWO FISHERS,Where the springing water wells.
65,TWO FISHERS,
66,TWO FISHERS,"It's God's own land for the nimble trout,"
67,TWO FISHERS,"And ferns and waving flowers,"
68,TWO FISHERS,"The bracken and the bilberry,"
69,TWO FISHERS,And the ash the coral dowers.
70,TWO FISHERS,"There are rolling leagues of heather,"
71,TWO FISHERS,Lone hills where the plovers call.
72,TWO FISHERS,"Oh, we'll climb those hills together"
73,TWO FISHERS,Ere the last dews fall!
74,TWO FISHERS,
75,TWO FISHERS,And we'll talk to the wild creatures
76,TWO FISHERS,In the crannies of the moors;
77,TWO FISHERS,"Oh, our hearts will mount to Heaven"
78,TWO FISHERS,When the merry lark soars!
79,TWO FISHERS,"All our days will shine with gladness,"
80,TWO FISHERS,All our nights with calm repose.
81,TWO FISHERS,And we'll throw a fly together
82,TWO FISHERS,Where the rushing stream flows.
83,TWO FISHERS,
84,TWO FISHERS,Nature has been to me lately
85,TWO FISHERS,"As a fair and radiant bride,"
86,TWO FISHERS,She has drawn me with strange gentleness
87,TWO FISHERS,To the hollow of her side.
88,TWO FISHERS,She has gone forth like a warrior
89,TWO FISHERS,"With pricking glaive and spear,"
90,TWO FISHERS,And Grief has quailed in his ambush
91,TWO FISHERS,When her flashing arms drew near.
92,TWO FISHERS,
93,TWO FISHERS,I never loved sweet England
94,TWO FISHERS,"Till she kissed me in the West,"
95,TWO FISHERS,The sun upon her shining brows
96,TWO FISHERS,"And the purple on her breast,"
97,TWO FISHERS,Breathing songs of low compassion
98,TWO FISHERS,"To my spirit as it cried,"
99,TWO FISHERS,When I mourned that sinning country
100,TWO FISHERS,Which had thrust me from her side.
101,TWO FISHERS,
102,TWO FISHERS,"All the wooded hills of the Eifel,"
103,TWO FISHERS,"All the vine-bergs of the Rhine,"
104,TWO FISHERS,"All the glimmering strands of the Baltic,"
105,TWO FISHERS,"All the Brocken black with pine,"
106,TWO FISHERS,"Hold no tenderness of Beauty,"
107,TWO FISHERS,"(Beauty in the spirit dwells,)"
108,TWO FISHERS,Such as smiles from one sweet valley
109,TWO FISHERS,Darkling 'mid the Western fells.
110,TWO FISHERS,
111,TWO FISHERS,*       *       *       *       *
112,TWO FISHERS,
113,TWO FISHERS,"Do you remember, old fellow,"
114,TWO FISHERS,"When we fished near Altenahr,"
115,TWO FISHERS,Where the red wine was flowing
116,TWO FISHERS,And the bowl flashed a star?
117,TWO FISHERS,"Do you remember the big schutzmann,"
118,TWO FISHERS,"With his sword by his side,"
119,TWO FISHERS,"Who guessed that you were poaching,"
120,TWO FISHERS,And scared you off to hide?
121,TWO FISHERS,
122,TWO FISHERS,"Oh, if he'd only known, Charley,"
123,TWO FISHERS,When you sought the bridge's cover
124,TWO FISHERS,That you'd join the British Army
125,TWO FISHERS,"And go killing of his brother,"
126,TWO FISHERS,He'd have searched bank and vineyard
127,TWO FISHERS,"For a poacher of such worth,"
128,TWO FISHERS,And put you in a prison cell
129,TWO FISHERS,To cool your summer's mirth.
130,TWO FISHERS,
131,TWO FISHERS,And do you remember the old inn
132,TWO FISHERS,"With the blue saint above the door,[1]--"
133,TWO FISHERS,"Simon Peter, who looked longingly"
134,TWO FISHERS,Upon our speckled store?--
135,TWO FISHERS,He who loves all careless fishers
136,TWO FISHERS,"Of the river and the sea,"
137,TWO FISHERS,And prays that God shall save them
138,TWO FISHERS,With his mates of Galilee.
139,TWO FISHERS,
140,TWO FISHERS,And what a wild night we had
141,TWO FISHERS,When we rode home again!
142,TWO FISHERS,For the students were all dancing
143,TWO FISHERS,And singing in the train;
144,TWO FISHERS,And a tall man twanged a banjo
145,TWO FISHERS,Till he fairly gave us fits;
146,TWO FISHERS,"And a porter ran up swearing,"
147,TWO FISHERS,And the banjo flew to bits.
148,TWO FISHERS,
149,TWO FISHERS,"We were all drunk as blazes,"
150,TWO FISHERS,Full of wine to burst.
151,TWO FISHERS,"But, by the sober lads of England,"
152,TWO FISHERS,Those Germans were the worst.
153,TWO FISHERS,"They were singing and dancing,"
154,TWO FISHERS,And shouting with delight;
155,TWO FISHERS,And the carriage rocked with laughter
156,TWO FISHERS,As we rushed into the night.
157,TWO FISHERS,
158,TWO FISHERS,"They are all dead now, Charley;"
159,TWO FISHERS,They were merry fellows then.
160,TWO FISHERS,They are dust and scattered ashes
161,TWO FISHERS,Washed by the rain.
162,TWO FISHERS,They are crying in the darkness
163,TWO FISHERS,Where a grayer planet spins.
164,TWO FISHERS,But the Lord is kind to fishers
165,TWO FISHERS,And has spared us in our sins.
166,TWO FISHERS,
167,TWO FISHERS,"Oh, the Lord is kind to fishers"
168,TWO FISHERS,Of the river and the sea
169,TWO FISHERS,For the sake of Simon Peter
170,TWO FISHERS,And the lads of Galilee!
171,TWO FISHERS,"For the sake of Simon Peter,"
172,TWO FISHERS,"Who so gladly would us shrive,"
173,TWO FISHERS,"We are walking in the sunlight,"
174,TWO FISHERS,We are breathing and alive.
175,TWO FISHERS,
176,TWO FISHERS,And when the War is over
177,TWO FISHERS,"We'll fish awhile together,"
178,TWO FISHERS,"We'll climb the Western mountains,"
179,TWO FISHERS,"And walk the Western heather,"
180,TWO FISHERS,And the curlew and the wild grouse
181,TWO FISHERS,"Will wake the vales with crying,"
182,TWO FISHERS,And their soft rushing pinions
183,TWO FISHERS,"Will tremble by us, sighing."
184,TWO FISHERS,
185,TWO FISHERS,All the dead shepherds
186,TWO FISHERS,Will hear them in their rest.
187,TWO FISHERS,But you mustn't heed dead shepherds
188,TWO FISHERS,When you're fishing in the West;
189,TWO FISHERS,You mustn't heed the lonely men
190,TWO FISHERS,"Who neither sing nor dance,"
191,TWO FISHERS,"There'll be always ghosts there, Charley,"
192,TWO FISHERS,When the wind beats up from France.
193,TWO FISHERS,
194,TWO FISHERS,It's the holy peace and quiet
195,TWO FISHERS,Breathing from the Western skies
196,TWO FISHERS,Which bring the stricken soul its rest
197,TWO FISHERS,And still the heart's wild cries.
198,TWO FISHERS,If I hadn't turned for healing
199,TWO FISHERS,"Where the moor to Heaven swells,"
200,TWO FISHERS,"I'd have been a dead man, listening"
201,TWO FISHERS,To the mourning of the bells.
202,TWO FISHERS,
203,TWO FISHERS,If God hadn't sent me healing
204,TWO FISHERS,"Where the mountain bares her breast,"
205,TWO FISHERS,I'd have gone wild and crazy
206,TWO FISHERS,With the things that I'm oppressed.
207,TWO FISHERS,"All my mad, merry comrades"
208,TWO FISHERS,"Of drink, and fight, and lust,"
209,TWO FISHERS,Are trodden into bloody clay
210,TWO FISHERS,And blowing with the dust.
211,TWO FISHERS,
212,TWO FISHERS,"Some marched away with Hindenburg,"
213,TWO FISHERS,"And some with General Kluck,"
214,TWO FISHERS,One under Austria's banners
215,TWO FISHERS,With the devil's cards for luck.
216,TWO FISHERS,"All my dreams went with them,"
217,TWO FISHERS,All the dreams my land denied;
218,TWO FISHERS,But they're smoke and drifting wreckage now
219,TWO FISHERS,On the War's wild tide.
220,TWO FISHERS,
221,TWO FISHERS,"It was years since I left England,--"
222,TWO FISHERS,"Almost singing to depart,--"
223,TWO FISHERS,"She had cast a net about me,"
224,TWO FISHERS,And thrust a dagger in my heart.
225,TWO FISHERS,But another country smiled to me
226,TWO FISHERS,"And made me quiet nooks,"
227,TWO FISHERS,"Where men crushed for me the grapes of joy,"
228,TWO FISHERS,And talked to me of books.
229,TWO FISHERS,
230,TWO FISHERS,"She was a kind land to me once, Charley,"
231,TWO FISHERS,I had real joy in her once;
232,TWO FISHERS,"Her folk loved Shakespeare and Byron,"
233,TWO FISHERS,Shunned no dreamer for a dunce.
234,TWO FISHERS,"They sang old folk songs, noble opera;"
235,TWO FISHERS,"Read Anglo-Saxon, old quaint sweets;"
236,TWO FISHERS,"And there were no starved souls in her temples,"
237,TWO FISHERS,And no begging men in her streets.
238,TWO FISHERS,
239,TWO FISHERS,But a hand ever cut my Heaven
240,TWO FISHERS,"With the sharpness of a sword,"
241,TWO FISHERS,"There was the very riot of gladness,"
242,TWO FISHERS,Reckless squander of Joy's hoard;
243,TWO FISHERS,Lechery and sad Corruption
244,TWO FISHERS,Danced in clinging robes of Light;
245,TWO FISHERS,Beauty smiled in the arms of Terror
246,TWO FISHERS,And diced with the minions of Night.
247,TWO FISHERS,
248,TWO FISHERS,"And you sprang to England's banner, comrade,"
249,TWO FISHERS,"With glad praises on your lips,"
250,TWO FISHERS,To the song of her sabres ringing
251,TWO FISHERS,And the thunder of her ships.
252,TWO FISHERS,But a sword broods in the darkness
253,TWO FISHERS,"Whose sweep is the wind's sway,"
254,TWO FISHERS,And the dumb white ships of Heaven
255,TWO FISHERS,Bear dimly Earth's glory away.
256,TWO FISHERS,
257,TWO FISHERS,The still white ships of Heaven
258,TWO FISHERS,Steal out beneath the stars;
259,TWO FISHERS,"And the grieving, sorrowing sailors"
260,TWO FISHERS,Are the dead men of the wars.
261,TWO FISHERS,They reck not of the chilly seas
262,TWO FISHERS,That wildly round them churn.
263,TWO FISHERS,"And the dusk scatters before the prows,"
264,TWO FISHERS,And the leaping waters burn.
265,TWO FISHERS,
266,TWO FISHERS,The pirate fleets of Heaven
267,TWO FISHERS,"Sweep forth into the night,"
268,TWO FISHERS,"Laden with spoils of the living,"
269,TWO FISHERS,"Their jewels of delight,"
270,TWO FISHERS,"Their topazes and rubies,"
271,TWO FISHERS,The bawds that gave them pleasure;
272,TWO FISHERS,"And the sad thieves reef the swelling sails,"
273,TWO FISHERS,And steal from Earth her treasure.
274,TWO FISHERS,
275,TWO FISHERS,"And the night hangs heavy on you, comrade,"
276,TWO FISHERS,And the bitter War goes on.
277,TWO FISHERS,You are parched for Heaven's starlight
278,TWO FISHERS,"And her soft, refreshing sun."
279,TWO FISHERS,Joy runs with a passion of swiftness
280,TWO FISHERS,On the gray feet of the wind.
281,TWO FISHERS,The doors of darkness tremble;
282,TWO FISHERS,Then swing back blind.
283,TWO FISHERS,
284,TWO FISHERS,"But you'll be a new man, one day,"
285,TWO FISHERS,Where the west wind thrills.
286,TWO FISHERS,You'll walk with your olden vigour
287,TWO FISHERS,Where Heaven clasps the great lone hills.
288,TWO FISHERS,And the evening sun will squander
289,TWO FISHERS,"Soft lustre of red wine,"
290,TWO FISHERS,And we'll drink the ripest vintage
291,TWO FISHERS,Where the sun and stars shine.
292,TWO FISHERS,
293,TWO FISHERS,For the Lord is kind to fishers
294,TWO FISHERS,"Of the river and the sea,"
295,TWO FISHERS,For the sake of Simon Peter
296,TWO FISHERS,And the lads of Galilee;
297,TWO FISHERS,"For the sake of Simon Peter,"
298,TWO FISHERS,"Who so lightly would us shrive,"
299,TWO FISHERS,We will drink the wine of Heaven
300,TWO FISHERS,And give praise we are alive.
301,TWO FISHERS,
302,TWO FISHERS,"All our days will shine with gladness,"
303,TWO FISHERS,All our nights with rich repose;
304,TWO FISHERS,Laughter will breathe from our spirits
305,TWO FISHERS,Like the sweet scent from the rose.
306,TWO FISHERS,And Joy in glittering armour
307,TWO FISHERS,"Will go forth as with a sword,"
308,TWO FISHERS,When we climb the fells together
309,TWO FISHERS,To the glory of the Lord.
310,TWO FISHERS,
311,TWO FISHERS,"Sweet sounds will rise from the moorland,"
312,TWO FISHERS,And bird and bee awake.
313,TWO FISHERS,Beauty will break and blossom
314,TWO FISHERS,For each stricken soldier's sake.
315,TWO FISHERS,"Oh, your heart will leap with joy, Charley,"
316,TWO FISHERS,"And your spirit know rest,"
317,TWO FISHERS,When we fish a little river
318,TWO FISHERS,I've heard singing in the West!

362,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
363,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","I was sick with pain, once,"
364,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Sick with pain.
365,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And an old witch drew to my side
366,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And healed me again.
367,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
368,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","She was withered, and wretched, and gray,"
369,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Deep stabbed with years.
370,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And the skin of her face was scarred
371,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",With hate and tears.
372,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
373,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",She had lived fierce days in that town
374,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",The sea-winds flog.
375,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","Hourly the neighbours jibed,"
376,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Cast stones at a dog.
377,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
378,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","They had slandered her, tricked her; robbed her"
379,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Of honour and purse.
380,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",But her wrongs slept deep in her heart
381,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",For the fiends to nurse.
382,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
383,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","One went blind; another stark mad,--"
384,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",He's dead.
385,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Fruit of the curse she flung.
386,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","""Old witch,"" they said."
387,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
388,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Life ran high there; men nourished their hates
389,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And slashed with swords.
390,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","Harsh skies swerved to the rim of the bay,--"
391,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Sweden seawards.
392,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
393,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","And I lay in her bare, clean room"
394,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",At the stairway's end.
395,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And the fierce pain clutched me and held me;
396,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And nought would fend.

398,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","""O mother,"" I cried--and she leaned to me--"
399,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","""Give me your hand's touch."

401,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","This same blind crutch."""
402,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
403,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And she placed her hand in my hand;
404,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And her touch thrilled me.
405,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And the blood ran warm in my veins;
406,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",And her dead life healed me.
407,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",
408,"GREIFSWALD, 1909","She was wasted, arid as one"
409,"GREIFSWALD, 1909",Whom no sun cheers.

430,THE PUPIL: RHINELAND,In the twilight hour when the shadows stir;
431,THE PUPIL: RHINELAND,Red lights of sunset swirled the gloom
432,THE PUPIL: RHINELAND,"And rested, glimmering, on her hair."

434,THE PUPIL: RHINELAND,Coil upon coil it wreathed her crown

450,THE BUSHRANGERS,As I was walking down Oxford Street
451,THE BUSHRANGERS,"Ten fierce soldiers I chanced to meet,"
452,THE BUSHRANGERS,"They wore big slouch hats with khaki sashes,"
453,THE BUSHRANGERS,"And talked like the angry guns, in flashes."
454,THE BUSHRANGERS,
455,THE BUSHRANGERS,"And my friend said to me, ""They come from Australia;"
456,THE BUSHRANGERS,Villainous fellows for War's regalia.
457,THE BUSHRANGERS,John Briton keeps a tobacconist's shed
458,THE BUSHRANGERS,"And twice they have held a gun at his head."""
459,THE BUSHRANGERS,
460,THE BUSHRANGERS,"Well, I would have given all I had"
461,THE BUSHRANGERS,"To have gone with the bunch of them, good or bad,"
462,THE BUSHRANGERS,"To have heard the wickedest say, ""Old fellow!"""
463,THE BUSHRANGERS,And staunched his wounds where the black guns bellow.
464,THE BUSHRANGERS,I'd have thought it a merry thing to die
465,THE BUSHRANGERS,With such stalwart comrades standing by.
466,THE BUSHRANGERS,
467,THE BUSHRANGERS,One of them had round eyes like coals--
468,THE BUSHRANGERS,True parson's quarry when he hunts souls.
469,THE BUSHRANGERS,The brawniest made my heart turn queer;
470,THE BUSHRANGERS,The devil in hell would have shunned his leer.
471,THE BUSHRANGERS,And the tallest and thinnest bore visible traces
472,THE BUSHRANGERS,Of his banished grandsire's vanished graces.
473,THE BUSHRANGERS,
474,THE BUSHRANGERS,But all the lot of that swaggering ten
475,THE BUSHRANGERS,"Were terrible, fine, strong soldier-men;"
476,THE BUSHRANGERS,And I fairly sobbed at the four cross ways
477,THE BUSHRANGERS,As my triumphing soul sang England's praise.
478,THE BUSHRANGERS,
479,THE BUSHRANGERS,O! all the Germans in Berlin town
480,THE BUSHRANGERS,Couldn't put those ten Australians down.
