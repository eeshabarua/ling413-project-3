42,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.
43,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
44,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
45,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"John Dryden was born on the 9th of August 1631, at a place variously"
46,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"denominated Aldwincle, or Oldwincle, All Saints; or at Oldwincle, St"
47,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Peter's, in Northamptonshire. The name Dryden or Driden, is from the"
48,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,North. There are Drydens still in the town of Scotland where we now
49,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,write; and the poet's ancestors lived in the county of Cumberland. One
50,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of them, named John, removed from a place called Staff-hill, to"
51,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Northamptonshire, where he succeeded to the estate of Canons-Ashby, by"
52,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,marriage with the daughter of Sir John Cope. John Dryden was a
53,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"schoolmaster, a Puritan, and honoured, it is said, with the friendship"
54,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of the celebrated Erasmus, after whom he named his son, who succeeded to"
55,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the estate of Canons-Ashby, and, besides becoming a sheriff of the"
56,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"county of Northamptonshire, was created a knight under James I. Sir"
57,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Erasmus had three sons, the third of whom, also an Erasmus, became the"
58,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"father of our poet. His mother was Mary, the daughter of the Rev. Henry"
59,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Pickering, whose father, a zealous Puritan, had been one of the marked"
60,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,victims in the Gunpowder Plot. Dryden thus had connexions both on his
61,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"father's and mother's side with that party, by deriding, defaming, and"
62,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,opposing which he afterwards gained much of his poetical glory.
63,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
64,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,The poet was the eldest of fourteen children--four sons and ten
65,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"daughters. The honour of his birth is claimed, as already stated, by two"
66,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"parishes, that of Oldwincle, All Saints, and that of Oldwincle, St"
67,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Peter's, as Homer's was of old by seven cities. His brothers and"
68,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sisters have been followed, by eager biographers, into their diverging"
69,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and deepening paths of obscurity--paths in which we do not choose to
70,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,attend them. Dryden received the rudiments of his education at Tichmarsh
71,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"or at Oundle--for here, too, we have conflicting statements. It is"
72,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"certain, however, that he was admitted a king's scholar at Westminster,"
73,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"under the tuition of Dr Busby, whom he always respected, and who"
74,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"discovered in him poetical power. He encouraged him to write, as a"
75,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thursday's night's task, a translation of the third Satire of Persius, a"
76,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"writer precisely of that vigorously rhetorical, rapidly satirical, and"
77,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"semi-poetical school, which Dryden was qualified to appreciate and to"
78,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,mirror; besides other pieces of a similar kind which are lost. During
79,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the last year of his residence at Westminster, and when only eighteen"
80,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"years of age, he wrote one among the ninety-eight elegies which were"
81,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"called forth by the sudden death of Henry Lord Hastings, and published"
82,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"under the title of ""Lachrymæ Musarum."" Hastings seems to have been an"
83,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"amiable person, but he was besides a lord, and _hinc illoe lachrymæ_."
84,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"We know not of what quality the other tears were, but assuredly Dryden's"
85,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"is one of very suspicious sincerity, and of very little poetical merit."
86,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"But even the crocodile tears of a great genius, if they fall into a"
87,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"fanciful shape, must be preserved; and we have preserved his,"
88,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"accordingly, notwithstanding the false taste as well as doubtful truth"
89,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and honesty of this his earliest poem.
90,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
91,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shortly after, Dryden obtained a Westminster scholarship, and on the"
92,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"11th of May 1650, entered on Trinity College, Cambridge. His tutor was"
93,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"one John Templer, famous then as one of the many who had attempted to"
94,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"put a hook in the jaws of old Hobbes, the Leviathan of his time, but"
95,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"whose reply, as well as Hobbes' own book (like a whale disappearing from"
96,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"a Shetland ""voe"" into the deep, with all the hooks and harpoons of his"
97,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,enemies along with him) has been almost entirely forgotten. At
98,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Cambridge, Dryden was noted for regularity and diligence, and took the"
99,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"degree of B.A. in January 1653-4, and in 1657 was made A.M. by a"
100,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"dispensation from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Once, indeed, he was"
101,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,rusticated for a fortnight on account of some disobedience to the
102,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"vice-master. He resided, however, at his university three years after"
103,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the usual term; and although he did not become a Fellow, and made no"
104,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"secret, in after days, of preferring Oxford to Cambridge, yet the reason"
105,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of this seems to have lain, not in any personal disgust, but in some"
106,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"other cause, which, says Scott, ""we may now search for in vain."""
107,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
108,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Up till June 1654, his father had continued to reside at his estate at"
109,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Blakesley, in Northamptonshire, when he died, leaving Dryden two-thirds"
110,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of a property, which was worth, in all, only £60 a-year. The other third"
111,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"was bequeathed to his mother, during her lifetime. With this miserable"
112,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"modicum of £40 a-year, the poet returned to Cambridge, and continued"
113,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"there, doing little, and little known as one who could do anything, till"
114,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the year 1657. The only records of the diligence of his college years,"
115,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"are the lines on the death of Lord Hastings, and one or two other"
116,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"inconsiderable copies of verses. He probably, however, employed much"
117,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,time in private study.
118,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
119,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"While at Cambridge, he met with a young lady, a cousin of his own--Honor"
120,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Driden, daughter of Sir John Driden of Chesterton--of whom he became"
121,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"deeply enamoured. His suit was, however, rejected, although he continued"
122,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,all his life on intimate terms with the family. Miss Driden died
123,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"unmarried, many years after her poet lover; and like the ""Lass of"
124,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Ballochmyle"" with Burns' homage, learned to value it more after he"
125,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"became celebrated, and carefully preserved the solitary letter which"
126,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Dryden wrote her.
127,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
128,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"But now the university was to lose, and the world of London to receive,"
129,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the poet. In the year 1657, when about six-and-twenty years of age,"
130,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden repaired to London, ""clad in homely drugget,"" and with more"
131,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,projects in his head than pence in his pocket. He was first employed by
132,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his relative, Sir Gilbert Pickering--called the ""Fiery Pickering,"" from"
133,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,his Roundhead zeal--as a clerk or secretary. Here he came in contact
134,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with Cromwell; and saw very clearly those great qualities of sagacity,"
135,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"determination, courage, statesmanship, insight and genuine godliness,"
136,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which made him, next to Alfred the Great, the first monarch who ever"
137,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sat on the English throne. Two years after Dryden came to London,"
138,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Cromwell expired, and the poet wrote and published his Heroic Stanzas on"
139,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the hero's death, which we consider really his earliest poem. When"
140,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Richard resigned, Dryden, in common with the majority of the nation, saw"
141,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"that the Roundhead cause was lost, and hastened to carry over his"
142,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"talents to the gaining side. For this we do not blame him very severely,"
143,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"although it certainly had been nobler if, like Milton, he had clung to"
144,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his party. Sir Walter Scott remarks, that Dryden never retracted the"
145,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"praise he gave to Cromwell. In ""Absalom and Achitophel"" he sneers at"
146,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Richard as Ishbosheth, but says nothing against the deceased giant Saul."
147,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"It is clear, too, that at first his desertion of the Cromwell party was"
148,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"a loss to the poet. He lost the chance of their favour, in case a"
149,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"reaction should come, his situation as secretary, and the shelter of"
150,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Pickering's princely mansion. As might have been expected, his ancient"
151,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"friends were indignant at the change, and not less so at the alteration"
152,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his
153,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,name--from Driden to Dryden.
154,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
155,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"He went to reside in the obscure house of one Herringman, a bookseller,"
156,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in the New Exchange, and became for life a professional author. His"
157,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at
158,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"this period of his life, and asserted that he was a mere drudge to"
159,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Herringman. He, at all events, did little in his own proper poetic"
160,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"calling for two years. A poem on the Coronation of Charles, well fitted"
161,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to wipe away the stain of Cromwellism, and to attract upon the poet the"
162,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"eye of that Rising-Sun, whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth; a"
163,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"panegyric on the Lord Chancellor; and a satire on the Dutch; were all,"
164,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and are all short, and all savour of a vein somewhat hide-bound. He"
165,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"planned, indeed, too, and partly wrote, one or more plays, and was"
166,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the Royal
167,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Society in 1662. Previous to this he had been introduced, through"
168,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Herringman, to Sir Robert Howard, son of the first Earl of Berkshire,"
169,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and a relation of Edward Howard, the author of ""British Princes,"" and"
170,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the object of the witty wrath of Butler. Sir Robert, too, had a"
171,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"poetical propensity, and Dryden and he became and continued intimate for"
172,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"a number of years, the poet assisting the knight in his literary"
173,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"compositions, particularly in a play entitled ""The Indian Queen;"" and"
174,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the latter inviting the former to the family seat at Charlton, where"
175,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard,"
176,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the sister of Sir Robert. It was on the 1st of December 1663, in St"
177,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Swithin's, London, and with the consent of the Earl, who settled about"
178,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"£60 a-year on his daughter, that this unhappy union took place. The lady"
179,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to
180,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"command a husband's respect or to conciliate his regard, but is"
181,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding. Much of
182,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the bitterness of Dryden's satire, some of the coarse licentiousness of"
183,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his plays, and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in"
184,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"multitudes, throughout his works, may be traced to his domestic"
185,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,unhappiness.
186,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
187,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Otherwise, the match had some advantages. It broke up, for a time at"
188,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"least, some licentious connexions he had formed, particularly, after a"
189,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"time, one with Mrs Reeves the actress, with whom, having laid aside his"
190,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Norwich drugget, he used to eat tarts at the Mulberry Gardens, ""with a"
191,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sword and a Chadreux wig."" It secured to him, including his own"
192,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"property, an income of about £100 a-year--a sum equal to £300 now--and"
193,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which, on the death of his mother, three years later, was increased by"
194,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"£20 more, or £60 at the present value of money. He was thus protected"
195,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the
196,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"literary man, under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed;"
197,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and if he could not always command luxuries, he was always sure of"
198,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,bread.
199,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
200,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"To improve his circumstances, however, and to enable him to keep up a"
201,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"style of living in unison with his lady's rank, he must write, and the"
202,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"question arose, what mode of composition was likely to be the most"
203,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"lucrative? Were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses, like those"
204,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to Clarendon, he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him"
205,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"now and then by a patron, like a crust to an unfortunate cur. Were he"
206,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to translate, or write prefaces for the booksellers, he might pay his"
207,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"bill for salt, if diligent enough. For Satires as yet there was little"
208,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,demand. The follies of the more fanatical of the Puritans were too
209,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"recent, although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of Butler;"
210,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and the far grosser absurdities of the Cavaliers were yet in blossom.
211,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"There remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage, which"
212,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,during the previous _regime_ had been abolished. While the French
213,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Revolution was in progress, ay, even in the depths of the reign of"
214,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"terror, the theatres were all open, and all crowded; but when Cromwell"
215,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"was enacting his solemn and solitary part, before God, angels, and men,"
216,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the petty potentates--the gods and goddesses of the stage--vanished into
217,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"thin air. At his tremendous stamp their cue had been ""_Exeunt omnes_"""
218,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and if the spirit of Shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure, he"
219,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,would have added his Amen. And had he watched in their stead the
220,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone, with all the world"
221,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"looking on, he might have remembered and re-applied his own magnificent"
222,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,words--
223,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
224,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""O for a muse of fire, that would ascend"
225,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,The brightest heaven of invention!
226,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,"
227,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,And _monarchs_ to _behold_ the swelling scene!
228,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Then should the warlike _Cromwell_ like himself
229,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,"
230,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire"
231,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Crouch for employment."""
232,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
233,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"No sooner had this great man passed away, and an earnest age with him,"
234,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and Charles mounted the throne, than from the darkest recesses of the"
235,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"stews and the taverns, from the depths within depths of Alsatia or Paris,"
236,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the whole tribe of dancers, fiddlers, drabs, mimes, stage-players, and"
237,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"playwrights, knowing that their enemy was dead, and their hour of harvest"
238,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"had come, emerged in swarming multitudes--multitudes swelled by the vast"
239,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"tribe of play-goers, who had been counting the hours since a Falstaff"
240,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"had made them laugh, an Ophelia made them weep, and a Lear made them"
241,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,tremble. And had this only issued in the revival of the drama of
242,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shakspeare and Johnson, few could have had much to say in objection; for"
243,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"that, in general, was as pure as it was powerful. But, alas, besides"
244,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"them there had been a Beaumont, a Fletcher, and a Massinger, with their"
245,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"unutterable abominations. Nay, the king and courtiers had imported from"
246,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,France a taste which required for its gratification a licentiousness
247,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"still more abandoned, and to be cast, besides, into forms and shapes, as"
248,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"stiff, stately, and elaborate as the material was vile, and were not"
249,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"contented with pollution unless served up in a new, piquant, and"
250,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,unnatural manner. Our poet understood this movement of his time right
251,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"well, and determined to conform to it. He knew that he could, better"
252,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"than any man living, pander to the popular appetite for the"
253,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"melodramatic, for the grandiloquent, and for the obscene. He knew the"
254,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"taste of Charles, and that he, above all cooks, could dress up a"
255,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,_ragout_ of that putrid perfection which his king relished. And he set
256,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"himself with his whole might so to do, and for thirty years and more"
257,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"continued his degradation of genius--a degradation unexampled, whether"
258,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"we consider the powers of the writer, the coarseness, quantity, and"
259,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"elaboration of the pollutions he perpetrated, or the length of time in"
260,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which he was employed, in thus ""profaning the God-given strength and"
261,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"marring the lofty line."""
262,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
263,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His other biographers--Dr Johnson, alone, with brevity and seeming"
264,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,reluctance--have enumerated and characterised all Dryden's plays. We
265,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"have decided only to speak of them very generally, and that for the"
266,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"following reasons:--1st, We are reprinting none of them; 2dly, From what"
267,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"we have read of them, we are certain that, even as works of art, they"
268,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"are utterly unworthy of their author, and that in morals they are, as a"
269,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"whole, a disgrace to human nature. We are not the least lenient or"
270,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"indulgent of critics. We have every wish to pity the errors, and to bear"
271,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with the frequent escapades and aberrations of genius. But when we see,"
272,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"as in Dryden's case, what we are forced to consider either a deliberate"
273,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and systematic attempt to poison the sources of virtue, or, at least, an"
274,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,elaborate and incessant habit of conformity to the bad tastes of a bad
275,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"age, we can think of no plea fully available for his defence. Vain to"
276,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"say, ""he wrote for bread."" He did not--he wrote only for the luxuries,"
277,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"not the staff of life. Vain to say, ""he consulted the taste of his"
278,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"audience, and suited their atmosphere."" But why did he _select_ that"
279,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,atmosphere as his? And why so much gratuitous and superfluous iniquity
280,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in his works? ""But he wrote to gratify his monarch."" This would form a"
281,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"good enough excuse for a Sporus, ""a white curd of ass' milk,"" but not"
282,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"for a strong man like Dryden. But he was ""no worse than others of his"
283,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"age."" Pitiful apology! since, being the ablest man of his day, and"
284,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"therefore bound to be before it, he was in reality behind it, his plays"
285,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,excelling all contemporary productions in wickedness as well as in wit.
286,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"But his own ""conduct was latterly irreproachable."" This we doubt, and"
287,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Scott doubts so too. But even though it were true, it were damaging,"
288,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"because it would deprive him of the plea of passion, and reduce him from"
289,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the warm human painter to the cold demon-like sculptor of unclean and
290,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"abominable ideas. It never can be forgotten, that whenever Dryden"
291,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"translated a filthy play, he made it filthier than in the original, and"
292,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,that he has once and again scattered his satyr-like fancies in spots
293,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"such as the Paradise of Milton, and the Enchanted Isle of Shakspeare,"
294,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,which every imagination and every heart previously had regarded as holy
295,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"ground. The only extenuating circumstance we can mention is, that his"
296,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,pruriency was latterly in part relinquished and much deplored by
297,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"himself, and that his poetry is, on the whole, free from it. In our"
298,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"critical paper, prefixed to the Second Volume, we intend to examine the"
299,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"question, how far an author's faults are, or are not, to be charged upon"
300,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,his age.
301,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
302,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His next poem was ""Annus Mirabilis,"" published in 1667, and counted"
303,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"justly one of his most vigorous, though also one of the faultiest of his"
304,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"poems. It includes glowing, although somewhat quaint and fantastic,"
305,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"descriptions of the Dutch War and the Great Fire in London. In 1668, by"
306,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the death of Sir William Davenant, the post of Poet-Laureate became"
307,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"vacant, and Dryden was appointed to it. He was also appointed"
308,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,historiographer-royal. The salary of these two offices amounted to £200
309,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"a year, besides the famous annual butt of canary, while his profits from"
310,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the theatre were equivalent to £300. His whole income was thus, at the"
311,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"very least, equal to a thousand pounds of our money--a great sum for a"
312,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"poet in that or in any age. He published, the same year, an Essay on"
313,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Dramatic Poetry,"" vindicating his own practice of rhymed heroic verse"
314,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in plays;--a stupid French innovation, which all the ingenuity of a"
315,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden defended in vain. It was cast into the shape of a dialogue,--the"
316,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Duke of Dorset being one of the respondents,--and formed the first"
317,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"specimen of Dryden's easy, rambling, but most vivid, vigorous, and"
318,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,entertaining prose. No one was ever more ready than he to render reasons
319,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"for his writings,--for their faults as well as merits,--and to show by"
320,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"more ingenious arguments, that, if they failed, they _ought_ to have"
321,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,succeeded.
322,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
323,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"At this time we may consider Dryden's prosperity, although not his"
324,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"powers, to have culminated. He had a handsome income, a run of"
325,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"unparalleled popularity as a playwright; he was Poet-Laureate, a"
326,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"favourite at court, and on terms of intimacy with many of the nobility,"
327,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and many of the eminent men of letters. The public would have at that
328,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"time bid high for his very snuff-papers, and were thankful for whatever"
329,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,garbage he chose to throw at them from the stage. How different his
330,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"position from that of the great blind old man, at this time residing in"
331,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Bunhill-fields in obscurity and sorrow, and preparing to put off his"
332,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"tabernacle, and take his flight to the Heavens of God! The one heard"
333,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"every night the ""claps of multitudes,""--the other the whispers of"
334,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"angels, saying to his soul, ""Sister-spirit, come away."" The one was"
335,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"revelling in reputation,--the other was listening to the far-off echoes"
336,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of a coming fame as wide as the world, and as permanent as the existence"
337,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of man. To do Dryden justice, he admired Milton; and although he did,"
338,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and that, too, immediately after Milton departed, venture to travestie"
339,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the ""Paradise Lost"" into a rhymed play, as dull as it is disgusting; and"
340,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"although he knew that Milton had called him, somewhat harshly, a ""good"
341,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rhymer, but no poet,"" yet he praised his genius at a time when it was"
342,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"as little appreciated, as was the grandeur of his character."
343,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
344,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"But now the slave, in the chariot of Dryden's triumph, was about to"
345,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"appear. First came, in 1671, the ""Rehearsal,"" a play concocted among"
346,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"various wits of the time, including Sprat, Clifford, poor Butler, of"
347,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Hudibras,"" and chiefly the Duke of Buckingham. The object of this play"
348,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"was to turn rhymed heroic tragedy, and especially the great playwright"
349,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of the day, under the name of Bayes, his person, manners, conversation,"
350,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and habits, into unmitigated ridicule. The plan has often since been"
351,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"followed, with various success. Minor wits have delighted in clubbing"
352,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"their small but poisoned missiles, and in aiming flights of minnikin"
353,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,arrows at the Gullivers of their different periods. Thus Pope was
354,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"assailed by the ""Dunces,"" whom he afterwards preserved in amber--that"
355,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"terrible old lion, Bentley, by Boyle and his associates; and Wordsworth,"
356,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,by the critics or criticasters of his day. Dryden acted with greater
357,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"prudence than any of those we have named, except indeed Bentley, who,"
358,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"being assailed upon points involving the integrity of his scholarship,"
359,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and on which demonstrative contradiction was possible, felt himself"
360,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"compelled to leave his lair, and to rend his enemies in pieces. But"
361,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden--feeling on this occasion, at least, that a squib, however"
362,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"personal and severe, cannot harm any man worthy of the name; and that"
363,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the very force of the laughter it produces, drives out the"
364,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sting--determined to answer it by silence, and to bide his time."
365,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Zimri,"" in Absalom and Achitophel, shows how deep had been his secret"
366,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"oath of vengeance, and how carefully the sweltered ""venom"" had been"
367,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"kept, in which at last he baptizes Buckingham, and embalms him at the"
368,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,same time for the wonder and contempt of posterity. Here is the danger
369,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of the smaller wits in a controversy of this kind. Their squibs excite a
370,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sensation at the moment, and sometimes annoy the assaulted giant much,"
371,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and his friends and publishers more; but he continues to live and grow,"
372,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"while their spiteful effusions perish; or worse, are preserved to the"
373,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"everlasting shame of their authors, on the lowest shelf of the records"
374,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of their enemy's fame.
375,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
376,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Two years after, occurred the famous controversy between Dryden and"
377,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Settle. Poor Elkanah Settle seemed raised up like another Mordecai to
378,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,poison the peace and disturb the false self-satisfaction of
379,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden,--raised up, rather--shall we say?--to wean the poet from a"
380,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sphere where his true place and power were not, and to prepare him for"
381,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"other stages, where he was yet destined far more powerfully to play his"
382,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"part. At all events, this should have been his inference from the"
383,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,success of Settle. It should have taught him that a scene where a
384,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"pitiful poetaster, backed by mob-favour and the word of a Rochester,"
385,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"could eclipse his glory, was no scene for him; and he ought instantly,"
386,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with proud humility, to have left the theatre for ever. Instead of this,"
387,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"he fell into a violent passion with one who, like himself, had levelled"
388,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his desires to the ""claps of multitudes,"" and had ravished the larger"
389,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,share of the coveted prize! And so there commenced a long and ludicrous
390,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,controversy--dishonourable to Settle much; to Rochester and Dryden
391,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,more--between a mere insolent twaddler and a man of real and
392,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,transcendent genius. The particulars of the struggle are too humiliating
393,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and contemptible to deserve a minute record. Suffice it, that Dryden,"
394,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"assisted by his future foe, Shadwell, wrote a scurrilous attack on"
395,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Settle, and his successful play, ""The Empress of Morocco;"" to which"
396,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Settle, nothing daunted, replied in terms of equal coarseness, and that"
397,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rochester, the patron of Settle, became mixed up in the fray, till,"
398,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"having been severely handled by Dryden in his ""Essay on Satire,""--a"
399,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"production generally, and we think justly, attributed to Mulgrave and"
400,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden in conjunction,--he took a mean and characteristic revenge. He"
401,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"hired bravoes, who, waiting for Dryden as he was returning, on the 18th"
402,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"December 1679, from Will's coffee-house to his own house in Gerard"
403,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Street, rushed out and severely beat and wounded him. That Dryden was"
404,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the author of the lines on Rochester has been doubted, although we think"
405,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,they very much resemble a rough and hurried sketch from his pen; that
406,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rochester deserved the truculent treatment he received in them, this"
407,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"anecdote sufficiently proves. It was partly, indeed, the manner of the"
408,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"age. Had this nobleman existed _now_, and been pilloried by a true and"
409,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"powerful pen, he would, in addition to his own anonymous assaults, have"
410,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"stirred up a posse of his creatures to assist him in seeking, by"
411,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"falsehoods, hypercriticisms, and abuse, to diminish the influence and"
412,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,take away the good name of his opponent. The Satanic spirit is always
413,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the same--its weapons and instruments are continually changing.
414,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
415,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Soon after this, Dryden translated the Epistles of Ovid, thus breathing"
416,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,himself for the far greater efforts which were before him. His mind
417,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"seems, for a season, to have balanced between various poetic plans. On"
418,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the one hand, the finger of his good genius showed him the fair heights"
419,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of epic song, waiting to be crowned by the coming of a new Virgil; on"
420,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the other side, the fierce fires of his passions pointed him downwards"
421,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to his many rivals and foes--the Cliffords, Leighs, Ravenscrofts,"
422,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rochesters, and Settles--who seemed lying as a mark for his satiric"
423,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"vengeance. He meditated, we know, an epic on Arthur, the hero of the"
424,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Round Table, and had, besides, many arrears of wrath lying past for"
425,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"discharge; but circumstances arose which turned his thoughts away, for a"
426,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"season, in a different direction from either Arthur or his personal"
427,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,foes.
428,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
429,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,The political aspects of the times were now portentous in the extreme.
430,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Charles II. had, partly by crime, partly by carelessness, and partly by"
431,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"ill-fortune, become a most unpopular monarch, and the more so, because"
432,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the nation had no hope even from his death, since it was sure to hand"
433,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"them over to the tender mercies of his brother, who had all his faults,"
434,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and some, in addition, of his own, without any of his merits. There was"
435,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"but one hope, and that turned out a mere aurora borealis, connected with"
436,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the Duke of Monmouth, who, through his extraction by a bend sinister"
437,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"from Charles, as well as through his popular manners, Protestant"
438,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"principles, and gracious exterior, had become such a favourite with the"
439,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"people, that strong efforts were made to exclude the Duke of York, and"
440,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to exalt him to the succession. These, however, were unsuccessful; and"
441,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shaftesbury, their leading spirit, was accused of treason, and confined"
442,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to the Tower. It was at this crisis, when the nobility of the land were"
443,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"divided, when its clergy were divided, when its literary men were"
444,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"divided,--not in a silent feud, but in a raging rupture, that Dryden,"
445,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"partly at the instigation of the Court, partly from his own impulse,"
446,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"lifted up his powerful pen,--the sceptre of the press,--and, with"
447,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"wonderful facility and felicity, wrote, and on the 17th November 1681,"
448,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"published, the satire of ""Absalom and Achitophel."" Its poetical"
449,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"merits--the choice of the names and period, although this is borrowed"
450,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,from a previous writer--the appearance of the poem at the most critical
451,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"hour of the crisis--and, above all, the portraitures of character, so"
452,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"easy and so graphic, so free and so fearless, distinguished equally by"
453,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"their animus and their animation, and with dashes of generous painting"
454,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,relieving and diversifying the general caricature of the
455,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"style,--rendered it instantly and irresistibly popular. It excited one"
456,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"universal cry--from its friends, of admiration, and from its enemies, of"
457,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rage. Imitations and replies multiplies around it, and sounded like"
458,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"assenting or like angry echoes. It did not, indeed, move the grand jury"
459,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to condemn Shaftesbury; but when, on his acquittal, a medal was struck"
460,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"by his friends, bearing on one side the head and name of Shaftesbury,"
461,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and on the other, the sun obscured by a cloud rising over the Tower and"
462,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"City of London, Dryden's aid was again solicited by the Court and the"
463,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"King in person, to make this the subject of a second satire; and, with"
464,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"great rapidity, he produced ""The Medal--a Satire against Sedition,"""
465,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which, completing and colouring the photograph of Shaftesbury, formed"
466,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the real Second Part of ""Absalom and Achitophel."" What bore that name"
467,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"came a year afterwards, when the times were changed, was written partly"
468,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,by a feebler hand--Nahum Tate; and flew at inferior game--Dryden's own
469,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,personal rivals and detractors.
470,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
471,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The principal of these was Shadwell, who had been an early friend of"
472,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden's, and who certainly possessed a great deal of wit and talent, if"
473,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,he did not attain to the measure of poetic genius. His principal power
474,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,lay in low comedy--his chief fault lay in his systematic and avowed
475,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,imitation of the rough and drunken manners of Ben Jonson. In the eye of
476,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden--whose own habits were convivial, although not to the same"
477,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,extent--the real faults of his opponent were his popularity as a comic
478,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"writer, and his politics. Shadwell was a zealous Protestant, and the"
479,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"bitterest of the many who replied to the ""Medal."" For this he became the"
480,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"hero of ""MacFlecknoe""--a masterly satire, holding him up to infamy and"
481,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"contempt--besides sitting afterwards for the portrait of Og, in the"
482,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"second part of ""Absalom and Achitophel."" Shadwell had, by and by, his"
483,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"revenge, by obtaining the laureateship, after the Revolution, in room of"
484,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden, and no doubt used the opportunity of drowning the memory of"
485,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,defeat in the butt of generous canary which had now for ever passed the
486,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,door of his formidable rival.
487,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
488,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden's circumstances, at this time, were considerably straitened. His"
489,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,pension as laureate was not regularly paid; the profits from the theatre
490,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"had somewhat fallen off. He tried in various ways, by prefacing a"
491,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"translation of ""Plutarch's Lives,"" by publishing a miscellany of"
492,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"versions from Greek and Latin authors, and by writing prologues to plays"
493,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and prefaces to books, to supply his exhausted exchequer. His"
494,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"good-humoured but heartless monarch set him on another task, for which"
495,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"he was never paid, writing a translation of Maimbourg's ""History of the"
496,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"League,"" the object of which was to damage Shaftesbury and his party, by"
497,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"branding them as enemies to monarchy. In 1682 he wrote his ""Religio"
498,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Laici."""
499,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
500,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Not long after, in February 1684, Charles II. became, for the first time"
501,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in his life, serious, as he felt death--the proverbial terror of"
502,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,kings--rapidly rushing upon him. He tried to hide the great and terrible
503,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,fact from his eyes under the shield of a wafer. He died suddenly--a
504,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"member of the ""holy Roman Catholic Church,""--and much regretted by all"
505,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his mistresses; and apparently by Dryden, who had been preparing the"
506,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"opera of ""Albion and Albanius,"" to commemorate the king's triumph over"
507,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the Whigs, when this event turned his harp into mourning, and his organ"
508,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,into the voice of them that weep. He set himself to write a poem which
509,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"should at once express regret for the set, and homage to the rising,"
510,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sun. This was his ""Threnodia Augustalis,"" a very unequal poem, but full"
511,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of inimitable passages, and discovering all that careless greatness"
512,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,which characterised the genius of the poet.
513,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
514,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Charles II. had, at Dryden's request, to whom arrears for four years had"
515,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"been due, raised his laureate salary to £300. The additional hundred"
516,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"dropped at the king's death, and James was mean enough even to curtail"
517,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the annual butt of sack. He probably had little hope of converting the
518,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"author of ""Religio Laici"" to his faith, else he would not have withheld"
519,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"what Charles had so recently granted. Afterwards, when he ascertained"
520,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"that an interesting process was going on in Dryden's mind, tending to"
521,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Popery, he perhaps thought that a little money cast into the crucible"
522,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,might materially determine the projection in the proper way; or perhaps
523,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the _prospect_ produced, or at least accelerated, the _process_. We"
524,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,admire much in Scott's elaborate and ingenious defence of Dryden's
525,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"change of faith; and are ready to grant that it was only a Pyrrhonist,"
526,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"not a Protestant, who became a Papist after all--but there was, as Dr"
527,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Johnson also thinks, an ugly _coincidence_ between the pension and the"
528,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"conversion. Grant that it was not bestowed for the first time by James,"
529,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"it had been withheld by him, and its restoration immediately followed"
530,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the change of his faith. Dr Johnson was pleased, when Andrew Miller said"
531,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"that he ""thanked God he was done with him,"" to know that Miller ""thanked"
532,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"God for anything;"" and so, when we consider the blasphemy, profanity,"
533,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and filth of Dryden's plays, and the unsettled and veering state of his"
534,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"religious and political opinions, we are almost glad to find him"
535,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"becoming ""anything,"" although it was only the votary of a dead and"
536,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"corrupted form of Christianity. You like to see the fierce, capricious,"
537,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and destructive torrent fixed, although it be fixed in ice."
538,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
539,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"That he found comfort in his new religion, and proved his sincerity by"
540,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rearing up his children in the faith which his wife had also embraced,"
541,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and by remaining a Roman Catholic after the Revolution, and to his own"
542,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"pecuniary loss, has often been asserted. But surely there is a point"
543,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"where the most inconsistent man is obliged to stop, if he would escape"
544,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the character of an absolute weather-cock; and that there are charms and
545,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"comforts in the Popish creed for one who felt with Dryden, that he had,"
546,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"partly in his practice, and far more in his writings, sinned against the"
547,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"laws of morality and common decency, we readily grant. Whether these"
548,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"charms he legitimate, and these comforts sound, is a very different"
549,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"question. Had Dryden, besides, turned Protestant again, we question if"
550,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"it would have saved him his laureate pensions, and it would certainly"
551,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"have blasted him for ever, under the charge of ingratitude to his"
552,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"benefactor James. On the whole, this passage of the poet's life is not"
553,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"very creditable to his memory, and his indiscriminate admirers had"
554,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,better let it alone. It would have strained the ingenuity and the
555,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,enthusiasm of Claud Halcro himself to have extracted matter for a
556,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"panegyrical ode on this conversion of ""glorious John."""
557,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
558,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Admitted into the bosom of the Church, he soon found that he must prove"
559,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,his faith by his works. He was employed by James to defend the reasons
560,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of conversion to the Catholic faith alleged by Anne Duchess of York, and"
561,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the two other papers on the same subject which, found in Charles' strong"
562,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"box, James had imprudently given to the world. This led him to a contest"
563,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with Stillingfleet, in which Dryden came off only second best. He next,"
564,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in an embowered walk, in a country retirement at Rushton, near his"
565,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"birthplace, composed his strange, unequal, but brilliant and ingenious"
566,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"poem, ""The Hind and the Panther,"" the object of which was to advocate"
567,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"King James' repeal of the Test Act, and to prove the immeasurable"
568,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"superiority of the Church of Rome to that of England, as well as to all"
569,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the dissenting sects. This piece produced a prodigious clamour against
570,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the author. Its plan was pronounced ridiculous--its argument
571,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"one-sided--its zeal assumed--and Montague and Prior, two young men then"
572,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rising into eminence, wrote a clever parody on it, entitled the ""Town"
573,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and Country Mouse."" In addition to this, he wrote a translation of"
574,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Varilla's ""History of Heresies,"" and a life of Francis Xavier, the"
575,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"famous apostle of the Indies, whose singular story, a tale of heroic"
576,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"endurance and unexampled labours, but bedropt with the most flagrant"
577,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"falsehoods, whether it be read in Dryden's easy and fascinating"
578,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"narrative, or in the more gorgeous and coloured account of Sir James"
579,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Stephen, in the ""Edinburgh Review,"" forms one of the most impressive"
580,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"displays of human strength and folly, of the greatness of devoted"
581,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"enthusiasm, and of the weakness and credulity of abject superstition."
582,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
583,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,In spite of all these attempts to bolster up a tottering throne and an
584,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"_effete_ faith, the Revolution came, and Dryden's hopes and prospects"
585,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,sank like a vision of the night. And now came the hour of his enemies'
586,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"revenge! How the Settles, the Shadwells, and the Ravenscrofts, rejoiced"
587,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"at the downfall of their great foe! and what ironical condolence, or"
588,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"bitter satirical exultation, they poured over his humiliation! And,"
589,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"worst of all, he durst not reply. ""His powers of satire,"" says Scott,"
590,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""at this period, were of no more use to Dryden than a sword to a man who"
591,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"cannot draw it."" The fate of Milton in miniature had now befallen him;"
592,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and it says much for the strength of his mind, that, as in Milton's"
593,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"case, Dryden's purest and best titles to fame date from his discomfiture"
594,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and degradation. Antæus-like, he had now reached the ground, and the"
595,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"touch of the ground to him, as to all giants, was inspiration."
596,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
597,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His history, from this date, becomes, still more than in the former"
598,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"portions of it, a history of his publications. He was forced back by"
599,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"necessity to the stage. In 1690, and in the next two years, he produced"
600,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"four dramas,--one of them, indeed, adapted from the French, but the"
601,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"other three, original; and one, Don Sebastian, deemed to rank among the"
602,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"best of his dramatic works. In 1693, another volume of miscellanies,"
603,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with more translations, appeared. He also published, about this time, a"
604,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"new version of ""Juvenal and Persius,"" portions of which were contributed"
605,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"by his sons John and Charles. His last play, ""Love Triumphant,"" was"
606,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"enacted--as his first, the ""Wild Gallant,"" had been--without success;"
607,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and it is remarkable, that while the curtain dropped heavily and slowly"
608,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"upon Dryden, it was opening upon Congreve, whose first comedy was"
609,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"enacted the same year with Dryden's last, and who became the lawful heir"
610,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of much of Dryden's licentiousness, and of more than his elegance and"
611,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,wit.
612,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
613,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"He next commenced the translation of ""Virgil,"" which in the course of"
614,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"three years he completed, and gave to the world. It was published in"
615,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"July 1697. He had dashed it off with the utmost freedom and fire, and no"
616,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,work was ever more thoroughly identified with its translator. It is
617,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"_Dryden's_ ""Virgil,"" every line of it. A great and almost national"
618,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"interest was felt in the undertaking, such as would be felt now, were it"
619,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,announced that Tennyson was engaged in a translation of Goethe. Addison
620,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"supplied arguments, and an essay on the ""Georgics."" A dedication to the"
621,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"new king was expected by the Court, but inexorably declined by the poet."
622,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"It came forth, notwithstanding, amidst universal applause; nor was the"
623,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"remuneration for the times small, amounting to at least £1200 or £1400."
624,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
625,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"So soon as this great work was off his hands, by way, we suppose, as"
626,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Scott was used to say, of ""refreshing the machiner,"" Dryden wrote his"
627,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"famous ode, ""Alexander's Feast,"" for a meeting of the Musical Society on"
628,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"St Cecilia's day,--wrote it, according to Bolingbroke, at one sitting,"
629,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"although he spent, it is said, a fortnight in polishing it into its"
630,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"present rounded and perfect form. It took the public by storm, and"
631,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"excited a greater sensation than any of the poet's productions, except"
632,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Absalom and Achitophel."" Dryden himself, when complimented on it as the"
633,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"finest ode in the language, owned the soft impeachment, and said, ""A"
634,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"nobler ode never was produced, and never will;"" and in a manner, if not"
635,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"absolutely, he was right."
636,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
637,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Dryden was now again at sea for a subject. Sometimes he revolved once
638,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"more his favourite plan of an Epic poem, and ""Edward the Black Prince"""
639,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,loomed for a season before him as its hero. Sometimes he looked up with
640,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"an ambitious eye to Homer, and we see his hand ""pawing"" like the hoof of"
641,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the war-horse in Job, as he smelled his battle afar off, and panted to"
642,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,do for Achilles and Hector what he had done for Turnus and Æneas. He
643,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"meant to have turned the ""Iliad"" into blank verse; but, after all,"
644,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"translated the only book of it which he published into rhyme. But, in"
645,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"fine, he determined to modernise some of the fine old tales of Boccacio"
646,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and Chaucer; and in March 1699-1700, appeared his brilliant ""Fables,"""
647,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with some other poems from his pen, for which he received £300 at"
648,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Jonson's hands.
649,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
650,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"This was his last publication of size, although he was labouring on when"
651,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"death surprised him, and within the last three weeks of his life had"
652,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"written the ""Secular Margin,"" and the prologue and the epilogue to"
653,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Fletcher's ""Pilgrim,""--productions remarkable as showing the ruling"
654,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"passion strong in death,--the squabbling litterateur and satirist"
655,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"combating and kicking his enemies to the last,--Jeremy Collier, for"
656,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"having accused him of licentiousness in his dramas; Milbourne, for"
657,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"having attacked his ""Georgics;"" and poor Blackmore for having doubted"
658,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the orthodoxy of ""Religio Laici,"" and the decency of ""Amphitryon"" and"
659,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Limberham."""
660,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
661,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,He had now to go a pilgrimage himself to a far country. He had long been
662,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,troubled with gout and gravel; but next came erysipelas in one of his
663,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"legs; and at last mortification, superinduced by a neglected"
664,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"inflammation in his toe, carried him off at three o'clock on Wednesday"
665,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"morning the 1st of May 1700. He died a Roman Catholic, and in ""entire"
666,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"resignation to the Divine will."" He died so poor, that he was buried by"
667,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"subscription, Lords Montague and Jeffries delaying the interment till"
668,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the necessary funds were raised. The body, after lying embalmed and in"
669,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"state for ten days in the College of Physicians, was buried with great"
670,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"pomp in Westminster Abbey, where now, between the graves of Chaucer and"
671,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Cowley, reposes the dust of Dryden."
672,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
673,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His lady survived him fourteen years, and died insane. His eldest son"
674,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Charles was drowned in 1704 at Datchett, while seeking to swim across"
675,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the Thames. John died at Rome of a fever in 1701. Erasmus, who was"
676,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"supposed to inherit his mother's malady, died in 1710; and the title"
677,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which he had derived from Sir Robert passed to his uncle, the brother of"
678,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the poet, and thence to his grandson. Sir Henry Edward Leigh Dryden, of"
679,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Canons-Ashby, is now the representative of the ancient family."
680,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
681,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,We reserve till our next volume a criticism on Dryden's genius and
682,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"works. As to his habits and manners, little is known, and that little is"
683,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"worn threadbare by his many biographers. In appearance he became, in"
684,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his maturer years, fat and florid, and obtained the name of ""Poet"
685,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Squab."" His portraits show a shrewd, but rather sluggish face, with long"
686,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"gray hair floating down his cheeks, not unlike Coleridge, but without"
687,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his dreamy eye, like a nebulous star. His conversation was less"
688,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sprightly than solid. Sometimes men suspected that he had ""sold all his"
689,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"thoughts to his booksellers."" His manners are by his friends pronounced"
690,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""modest;"" and the word modest has since been amiably confounded by his"
691,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"biographers with ""pure."" Bashful he seems to have been to awkwardness;"
692,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,but he was by no means a model of the virtues. He loved to sit at Will's
693,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"coffee-house, and be the arbiter of criticism. His favourite stimulus"
694,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"was snuff, and his favourite amusement angling. He had a bad address, a"
695,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"down look, and little of the air of a gentleman. Addison is reported to"
696,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,have taught him latterly the intemperate use of wine; but this was said
697,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"by Dennis, who admired Dryden, and who hated Addison; and his testimony"
698,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,is impotent against either party. We admire the simplicity of the
699,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"critics who can read his plays, and then find himself a model of"
700,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"continence and virtue. ""Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth"
701,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"speaketh;"" and a more polluted mouth than Dryden's never uttered its"
702,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"depravities on the stage. We cannot, in fine, call him personally a very"
703,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"honest, a very high-minded, or a very good man, although we are willing"
704,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to count him amiable, ready to make very considerable allowance for his"
705,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"period and his circumstances, not disposed to think him so much a"
706,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"renegado and deliberate knave as a fickle, needy, and childish"
707,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"changeling, in the matter of his ""perversion"" to Popery; although we"
708,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"yield to none in admiration of the varied, highly-cultured, masculine,"
709,THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and magnificent forces of his genius.

2001,HOWARD.,"Sir,--I am so many ways obliged to you, and so little able to return"
2002,HOWARD.,"your favours, that, like those who owe too much, I can only live by"
2003,HOWARD.,getting further into your debt. You have not only been careful of my
2004,HOWARD.,"fortune, which was the effect of your nobleness, but you have been"
2005,HOWARD.,"solicitous of my reputation, which is that of your kindness. It is not"
2006,HOWARD.,"long since I gave you the trouble of perusing a play for me, and now,"
2007,HOWARD.,"instead of an acknowledgment, I have given you a greater, in the"
2008,HOWARD.,"correction of a poem. But since you are to bear this persecution, I will"
2009,HOWARD.,at least give you the encouragement of a martyr; you could never suffer
2010,HOWARD.,in a nobler cause. For I have chosen the most heroic subject which any
2011,HOWARD.,"poet could desire: I have taken upon me to describe the motives, the"
2012,HOWARD.,"beginning, progress, and successes, of a most just and necessary war; in"
2013,HOWARD.,"it, the care, management, and prudence of our king; the conduct and"
2014,HOWARD.,"valour of a royal admiral, and of two incomparable generals; the"
2015,HOWARD.,invincible courage of our captains and seamen; and three glorious
2016,HOWARD.,"victories, the result of all. After this I have, in the Fire, the most"
2017,HOWARD.,"deplorable, but withal the greatest, argument that can be imagined: the"
2018,HOWARD.,"destruction being so swift, so sudden, so vast and miserable, as nothing"
2019,HOWARD.,"can parallel in story. The former part of this poem, relating to the"
2020,HOWARD.,"war, is but a due expiation for my not having served my king and country"
2021,HOWARD.,in it. All gentlemen are almost obliged to it; and I know no reason we
2022,HOWARD.,"should give that advantage to the commonalty of England, to be foremost"
2023,HOWARD.,"in brave actions, which the nobles of France would never suffer in their"
2024,HOWARD.,peasants. I should not have written this but to a person who has been
2025,HOWARD.,"ever forward to appear in all employments, whither his honour and"
2026,HOWARD.,"generosity have called him. The latter part of my poem, which describes"
2027,HOWARD.,"the Fire, I owe, first to the piety and fatherly affection of our"
2028,HOWARD.,"monarch to his suffering subjects; and, in the second place, to the"
2029,HOWARD.,"courage, loyalty, and magnanimity of the city: both which were so"
2030,HOWARD.,"conspicuous, that I wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve. I"
2031,HOWARD.,"have called my poem Historical, not Epic, though both the actions and"
2032,HOWARD.,actors are as much heroic as any poem can contain. But since the action
2033,HOWARD.,"is not properly one, nor that accomplished in the last successes, I have"
2034,HOWARD.,"judged it too bold a title for a few stanzas, which are little more in"
2035,HOWARD.,"number than a single Iliad, or the longest of the Æneids. For this"
2036,HOWARD.,"reason (I mean not of length, but broken action, tied too severely to"
2037,HOWARD.,the laws of history) I am apt to agree with those who rank Lucan rather
2038,HOWARD.,"among historians in verse, than Epic poets: in whose room, if I am not"
2039,HOWARD.,"deceived, Silius Italicus, though a worse writer, may more justly be"
2040,HOWARD.,"admitted. I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains, or stanzas of"
2041,HOWARD.,"four in alternate rhyme, because I have ever judged them more noble, and"
2042,HOWARD.,"of greater dignity, both for the sound and number, than any other verse"
2043,HOWARD.,in use amongst us; in which I am sure I have your approbation. The
2044,HOWARD.,"learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us, in not being"
2045,HOWARD.,tied to the slavery of any rhyme; and were less constrained in the
2046,HOWARD.,"quantity of every syllable, which they might vary with spondees or"
2047,HOWARD.,"dactyls, besides so many other helps of grammatical figures, for the"
2048,HOWARD.,"lengthening or abbreviation of them, than the modern are in the close of"
2049,HOWARD.,"that one syllable, which often confines, and more often corrupts, the"
2050,HOWARD.,"sense of all the rest. But in this necessity of our rhymes, I have"
2051,HOWARD.,"always found the couplet verse most easy, though not so proper for this"
2052,HOWARD.,"occasion: for there the work is sooner at an end, every two lines"
2053,HOWARD.,concluding the labour of the poet; but in quatrains he is to carry it
2054,HOWARD.,"further on, and not only so, but to bear along in his head the"
2055,HOWARD.,troublesome sense of four lines together. For those who write correctly
2056,HOWARD.,"in this kind must needs acknowledge, that the last line of the stanza is"
2057,HOWARD.,to be considered in the composition of the first. Neither can we give
2058,HOWARD.,ourselves the liberty of making any part of a verse for the sake of
2059,HOWARD.,"rhyme, or concluding with a word which is not current English, or using"
2060,HOWARD.,the variety of female rhymes; all which our fathers practised: and for
2061,HOWARD.,"the female rhymes, they are still in use among other nations; with the"
2062,HOWARD.,"Italian in every line, with the Spaniard promiscuously, with the French"
2063,HOWARD.,"alternately; as those who have read the Alarique, the Pucelle, or any of"
2064,HOWARD.,"their later poems, will agree with me. And besides this, they write in"
2065,HOWARD.,"Alexandrius, or verses of six feet; such as amongst us is the old"
2066,HOWARD.,"translation of Homer by Chapman: all which, by lengthening of their"
2067,HOWARD.,"chain, makes the sphere of their activity the larger. I have dwelt too"
2068,HOWARD.,"long upon the choice of my stanza, which you may remember is much better"
2069,HOWARD.,defended in the preface to Gondibert; and therefore I will hasten to
2070,HOWARD.,"acquaint you with my endeavours in the writing. In general, I will only"
2071,HOWARD.,"say, I have never yet seen the description of any naval fight in the"
2072,HOWARD.,"proper terms which are used at sea: and if there be any such, in another"
2073,HOWARD.,"language, as that of Lucan in the third of his Pharsalia, yet I could"
2074,HOWARD.,not avail myself of it in the English; the terms of art in every tongue
2075,HOWARD.,bearing more of the idiom of it than any other words. We hear indeed
2076,HOWARD.,"among our poets, of the thundering of guns, the smoke, the disorder, and"
2077,HOWARD.,"the slaughter; but all these are common notions. And certainly, as those"
2078,HOWARD.,"who, in a logical dispute, keep in general terms, would hide a fallacy;"
2079,HOWARD.,"so those who do it in any poetical description, would veil their"
2080,HOWARD.,ignorance.
2081,HOWARD.,
2082,HOWARD.,"Descriptas servare vices operumque colores,"
2083,HOWARD.,"Cur ego, si nequeo ignoroque, Poeta salutor?"
2084,HOWARD.,
2085,HOWARD.,"For my own part, if I had little knowledge of the sea, yet I have"
2086,HOWARD.,"thought it no shame to learn: and if I have made some few mistakes, it"
2087,HOWARD.,"is only, as you can bear me witness, because I have wanted opportunity"
2088,HOWARD.,"to correct them; the whole poem being first written, and now sent you"
2089,HOWARD.,"from a place, where I have not so much as the converse of any seaman."
2090,HOWARD.,"Yet though the trouble I had in writing it was great, it was more than"
2091,HOWARD.,recompensed by the pleasure. I found myself so warm in celebrating the
2092,HOWARD.,"praises of military men, two such especially as the prince[36] and"
2093,HOWARD.,"general, that it is no wonder if they inspired me with thoughts above my"
2094,HOWARD.,"ordinary level. And I am well satisfied, that, as they are incomparably"
2095,HOWARD.,"the best subject I ever had, excepting only the royal family, so also,"
2096,HOWARD.,that this I have written of them is much better than what I have
2097,HOWARD.,performed on any other. I have been forced to help out other arguments;
2098,HOWARD.,but this has been bountiful to me: they have been low and barren of
2099,HOWARD.,"praise, and I have exalted them, and made them fruitful; but"
2100,HOWARD.,"here--_Omnia sponte suâ reddit justissima tellus_. I have had a large, a"
2101,HOWARD.,"fair, and a pleasant field; so fertile that, without my cultivating, it"
2102,HOWARD.,"has given me two harvests in a summer, and in both oppressed the reaper."
2103,HOWARD.,All other greatness in subjects is only counterfeit; it will not endure
2104,HOWARD.,the test of danger; the greatness of arms is only real; other greatness
2105,HOWARD.,"burdens a nation with its weight, this supports it with its strength."
2106,HOWARD.,"And as it is the happiness of the age, so it is the peculiar goodness of"
2107,HOWARD.,"the best of kings, that we may praise his subjects without offending"
2108,HOWARD.,"him. Doubtless, it proceeds from a just confidence of his own virtue,"
2109,HOWARD.,which the lustre of no other can be so great as to darken in him; for
2110,HOWARD.,the good or the valiant are never safely praised under a bad or a
2111,HOWARD.,degenerate prince. But to return from this digression to a further
2112,HOWARD.,"account of my poem; I must crave leave to tell you, that as I have"
2113,HOWARD.,"endeavoured to adorn it with noble thoughts, so much more to express"
2114,HOWARD.,"those thoughts with elocution. The composition of all poems is, or ought"
2115,HOWARD.,"to be, of wit; and wit in the poet, or wit-writing (if you will give me"
2116,HOWARD.,leave to use a school-distinction) is no other than the faculty of
2117,HOWARD.,"imagination in the writer, which, like a nimble spaniel, beats over and"
2118,HOWARD.,"ranges through the field of memory, till it springs the quarry it hunted"
2119,HOWARD.,"after: or, without metaphor, which searches over all the memory for the"
2120,HOWARD.,species or ideas of those things which it designs to represent. Wit
2121,HOWARD.,"written is that which is well designed, the happy result of thought, or"
2122,HOWARD.,"product of imagination. But to proceed from wit, in the general notion"
2123,HOWARD.,"of it, to the proper wit of an heroic or historical poem; I judge it"
2124,HOWARD.,"chiefly to consist in the delightful imaging of persons, actions,"
2125,HOWARD.,"passions, or things. It is not the jerk or sting of an epigram, nor the"
2126,HOWARD.,seeming contradiction of a poor antithesis (the delight of an
2127,HOWARD.,ill-judging audience in a play of rhyme) nor the jingle of a more poor
2128,HOWARD.,"Paronomasia; neither is it so much the morality of a grave sentence,"
2129,HOWARD.,"affected by Lucan, but more sparingly used by Virgil; but it is some"
2130,HOWARD.,"lively and apt description, dressed in such colours of speech, that it"
2131,HOWARD.,"sets before your eyes the absent object, as perfectly, and more"
2132,HOWARD.,delightfully than nature. So then the first happiness of the poet's
2133,HOWARD.,imagination is properly invention or finding of the thought; the second
2134,HOWARD.,"is fancy, or the variation, deriving or moulding of that thought, as the"
2135,HOWARD.,"judgment represents it proper to the subject; the third is elocution, or"
2136,HOWARD.,"the art of clothing and adorning that thought, so found and varied, in"
2137,HOWARD.,"apt, significant, and sounding words: the quickness of the imagination"
2138,HOWARD.,"is seen in the invention, the fertility in the fancy, and the accuracy"
2139,HOWARD.,"in the expression. For the two first of these, Ovid is famous among the"
2140,HOWARD.,"poets; for the latter, Virgil. Ovid images more often the movements and"
2141,HOWARD.,"affections of the mind, either combating between two contrary passions,"
2142,HOWARD.,or extremely discomposed by one. His words therefore are the least part
2143,HOWARD.,"of his care; for he pictures nature in disorder, with which the study"
2144,HOWARD.,and choice of words is inconsistent. This is the proper wit of dialogue
2145,HOWARD.,"or discourse, and consequently of the drama, where all that is said is"
2146,HOWARD.,"to be supposed the effect of sudden thought; which, though it excludes"
2147,HOWARD.,"not the quickness of wit in repartees, yet admits not a too curious"
2148,HOWARD.,"election of words, too frequent allusions, or use of tropes, or, in"
2149,HOWARD.,"fine, anything that shows remoteness of thought or labour in the writer."
2150,HOWARD.,"On the other side, Virgil speaks not so often to us in the person of"
2151,HOWARD.,"another, like Ovid, but in his own: he relates almost all things as from"
2152,HOWARD.,"himself, and thereby gains more liberty than the other, to express his"
2153,HOWARD.,"thoughts with all the graces of elocution, to write more figuratively,"
2154,HOWARD.,and to confess as well the labour as the force of his imagination.
2155,HOWARD.,"Though he describes his Dido well and naturally, in the violence of her"
2156,HOWARD.,"passions, yet he must yield in that to the Myrrha, the Biblis, the"
2157,HOWARD.,"Althæa, of Ovid; for as great an admirer of him as I am, I must"
2158,HOWARD.,"acknowledge, that if I see not more of their souls than I see of Dido's,"
2159,HOWARD.,at least I have a greater concernment for them: and that convinces me
2160,HOWARD.,that Ovid has touched those tender strokes more delicately than Virgil
2161,HOWARD.,"could. But when action or persons are to be described, when any such"
2162,HOWARD.,"image is to be set before us, how bold, how masterly are the strokes of"
2163,HOWARD.,"Virgil! We see the objects he presents us with in their native figures,"
2164,HOWARD.,"in their proper motions; but so we see them, as our own eyes could never"
2165,HOWARD.,have beheld them so beautiful in themselves. We see the soul of the
2166,HOWARD.,"poet, like that universal one of which he speaks, informing and moving"
2167,HOWARD.,through all his pictures:
2168,HOWARD.,
2169,HOWARD.,--Totamque infusa per artus
2170,HOWARD.,"Mens agitat molem, et magno so corpore miscet."
2171,HOWARD.,
2172,HOWARD.,
2173,HOWARD.,"We behold him embellishing his images, as he makes Venus breathing"
2174,HOWARD.,beauty upon her son Æneas.
2175,HOWARD.,
2176,HOWARD.,--lumenque juventæ
2177,HOWARD.,"Purpureum, et lætos oculis afflârat honores:"
2178,HOWARD.,"Quale manus addunt ebori decus, aut ubi flavo"
2179,HOWARD.,Argentum Pariusve lapis circundatur auro.
2180,HOWARD.,
2181,HOWARD.,"See his Tempest, his Funeral Sports, his Combat of Turnus and Æneas: and"
2182,HOWARD.,"in his Georgics, which I esteem the divinest part of all his writings,"
2183,HOWARD.,"the Plague, the Country, the Battle of the Bulls, the Labour of the"
2184,HOWARD.,"Bees, and those many other excellent images of nature, most of which are"
2185,HOWARD.,"neither great in themselves, nor have any natural ornament to bear them"
2186,HOWARD.,up: but the words wherewith he describes them are so excellent that it
2187,HOWARD.,"might be well applied to him, which was said by Ovid, _Materiam"
2188,HOWARD.,superabat opus_: the very sound of his words has often somewhat that is
2189,HOWARD.,"connatural to the subject; and while we read him, we sit, as in a play,"
2190,HOWARD.,"beholding the scenes of what he represents. To perform this, he made"
2191,HOWARD.,"frequent use of tropes, which you know change the nature of a known"
2192,HOWARD.,"word, by applying it to some other signification; and this is it which"
2193,HOWARD.,Horace means in his epistle to the Pisos:
2194,HOWARD.,
2195,HOWARD.,"Dixeris egregiè, notum si callida verbum"
2196,HOWARD.,Reddiderit junctura novum--
2197,HOWARD.,
2198,HOWARD.,But I am sensible I have presumed too far to entertain you with a rude
2199,HOWARD.,"discourse of that art, which you both know so well, and put into"
2200,HOWARD.,"practice with so much happiness. Yet before I leave Virgil, I must own"
2201,HOWARD.,"the vanity to tell you, and by you the world, that he has been my master"
2202,HOWARD.,"in this poem: I have followed him everywhere, I know not with what"
2203,HOWARD.,"success, but I am sure with diligence enough: my images are many of them"
2204,HOWARD.,"copied from him, and the rest are imitations of him. My expressions"
2205,HOWARD.,also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would admit of in
2206,HOWARD.,"translation. And this, sir, I have done with that boldness, for which I"
2207,HOWARD.,"will stand accountable to any of our little critics, who, perhaps, are"
2208,HOWARD.,no better acquainted with him than I am. Upon your first perusal of this
2209,HOWARD.,"poem, you have taken notice of some words which I have innovated (if it"
2210,HOWARD.,"be too bold for me to say refined) upon his Latin; which, as I offer not"
2211,HOWARD.,"to introduce into English prose, so I hope they are neither improper,"
2212,HOWARD.,"nor altogether inelegant in verse; and, in this, Horace will again"
2213,HOWARD.,defend me.
2214,HOWARD.,
2215,HOWARD.,"Et nova, fictaque nuper, habebunt verba fidem, si"
2216,HOWARD.,"Græco fonte cadunt, parcè detorta--"
2217,HOWARD.,
2218,HOWARD.,The inference is exceeding plain: for if a Roman poet might have liberty
2219,HOWARD.,"to coin a word, supposing only that it was derived from the Greek, was"
2220,HOWARD.,"put into a Latin termination, and that he used this liberty but seldom,"
2221,HOWARD.,and with modesty; how much more justly may I challenge that privilege to
2222,HOWARD.,"do it with the same prerequisites, from the best and most judicious of"
2223,HOWARD.,"Latin writers! In some places, where either the fancy or the words were"
2224,HOWARD.,"his, or any other's, I have noted it in the margin, that I might not"
2225,HOWARD.,"seem a plagiary; in others I have neglected it, to avoid as well"
2226,HOWARD.,"tediousness, as the affectation of doing it too often. Such descriptions"
2227,HOWARD.,"or images well wrought, which I promise not for mine, are, as I have"
2228,HOWARD.,"said, the adequate delight of heroic poesy; for they beget admiration,"
2229,HOWARD.,"which is its proper object; as the images of the burlesque, which is"
2230,HOWARD.,"contrary to this, by the same reason beget laughter: for the one shows"
2231,HOWARD.,"nature beautified, as in the picture of a fair woman, which we all"
2232,HOWARD.,"admire; the other shows her deformed, as in that of a lazar, or of a"
2233,HOWARD.,"fool with distorted face and antique gestures, at which we cannot"
2234,HOWARD.,"forbear to laugh, because it is a deviation from nature. But though the"
2235,HOWARD.,"same images serve equally for the Epic poesy, and for the historic and"
2236,HOWARD.,"panegyric, which are branches of it, yet a several sort of sculpture is"
2237,HOWARD.,"to be used in them. If some of them are to be like those of Juvenal,"
2238,HOWARD.,"_Stantes in curribus Æmiliani_, heroes drawn in their triumphal"
2239,HOWARD.,"chariots, and in their full proportion; others are to be like that of"
2240,HOWARD.,"Virgil, _Spirantia mollius oera_: there is somewhat more of softness and"
2241,HOWARD.,tenderness to be shown in them. You will soon find I write not this
2242,HOWARD.,"without concern. Some, who have seen a paper of verses, which I wrote"
2243,HOWARD.,"last year to her Highness the Duchess, have accused them of that only"
2244,HOWARD.,"thing I could defend in them. They said, I did _humi serpere_, that I"
2245,HOWARD.,"wanted not only height of fancy, but dignity of words, to set it off. I"
2246,HOWARD.,"might well answer with that of Horace, _Nunc non erat his locus_; I knew"
2247,HOWARD.,"I addressed them to a lady, and accordingly I affected the softness of"
2248,HOWARD.,"expression, and the smoothness of measure, rather than the height of"
2249,HOWARD.,"thought; and in what I did endeavour, it is no vanity to say I have"
2250,HOWARD.,succeeded. I detest arrogance; but there is some difference betwixt that
2251,HOWARD.,"and a just defence. But I will not further bribe your candour, or the"
2252,HOWARD.,"reader's. I leave them to speak for me; and, if they can, to make out"
2253,HOWARD.,"that character, not pretending to a greater, which I have given them."
2254,HOWARD.,
2255,HOWARD.,"And now, sir, it is time I should relieve you from the tedious length of"
2256,HOWARD.,this account. You have better and more profitable employment for your
2257,HOWARD.,"hours, and I wrong the public to detain you longer. In conclusion, I"
2258,HOWARD.,"must leave my poem to you with all its faults, which I hope to find"
2259,HOWARD.,fewer in the printing by your emendations. I know you are not of the
2260,HOWARD.,"number of those, of whom the younger Pliny speaks; _Nec sunt parum"
2261,HOWARD.,"multi, qui carpere amicos suos judicium vocant_: I am rather too secure"
2262,HOWARD.,of you on that side. Your candour in pardoning my errors may make you
2263,HOWARD.,more remiss in correcting them; if you will not withal consider that
2264,HOWARD.,"they come into the world with your approbation, and through your hands."
2265,HOWARD.,"I beg from you the greatest favour you can confer upon an absent person,"
2266,HOWARD.,"since I repose upon your management what is dearest to me, my fame and"
2267,HOWARD.,reputation; and therefore I hope it will stir you up to make my poem
2268,HOWARD.,"fairer by many of your blots; if not, you know the story of the gamester"
2269,HOWARD.,"who married the rich man's daughter, and when her father denied the"
2270,HOWARD.,"portion, christened all the children by his surname, that if, in"
2271,HOWARD.,"conclusion, they must beg, they should do so by one name, as well as by"
2272,HOWARD.,"the other. But since the reproach of my faults will light on you, it is"
2273,HOWARD.,"but reason I should do you that justice to the readers, to let them"
2274,HOWARD.,"know, that, if there be anything tolerable in this poem, they owe the"
2275,HOWARD.,"argument to your choice, the writing to your encouragement, the"
2276,HOWARD.,"correction to your judgment, and the care of it to your friendship, to"
2277,HOWARD.,"which he must ever acknowledge himself to owe all things, who is, sir,"
2278,HOWARD.,"the most obedient, and most faithful of your servants,"

2353,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Him aged seamen might their master call,"
2354,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And choose for general, were he not their king."
2355,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2356,JOHN DRYDEN.,"15 It seems as every ship their sovereign knows,"
2357,JOHN DRYDEN.,His awful summons they so soon obey;
2358,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So hear the scaly herd when Proteus blows,"
2359,JOHN DRYDEN.,And so to pasture follow through the sea.
2360,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2361,JOHN DRYDEN.,"16 To see this fleet upon the ocean move,"
2362,JOHN DRYDEN.,Angels drew wide the curtains of the skies;
2363,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And heaven, as if there wanted lights above,"
2364,JOHN DRYDEN.,For tapers made two glaring comets rise.
2365,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2366,JOHN DRYDEN.,"17 Whether they unctuous exhalations are,"
2367,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Fired by the sun, or seeming so alone:"
2368,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or each some more remote and slippery star,"
2369,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which loses footing when to mortals shown.
2370,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2371,JOHN DRYDEN.,"18 Or one, that bright companion of the sun,"
2372,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose glorious aspect seal'd our new-born king;
2373,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And now a round of greater years begun,"
2374,JOHN DRYDEN.,New influence from his walks of light did bring.
2375,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2376,JOHN DRYDEN.,"19 Victorious York did first with famed success,"
2377,JOHN DRYDEN.,To his known valour make the Dutch give place:
2378,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus Heaven our monarch's fortune did confess,"
2379,JOHN DRYDEN.,Beginning conquest from his royal race.
2380,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2381,JOHN DRYDEN.,"20 But since it was decreed, auspicious King,"
2382,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In Britain's right that thou shouldst wed the main,"
2383,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Heaven, as a gage, would cast some precious thing,"
2384,JOHN DRYDEN.,And therefore doom'd that Lawson[37] should be slain.
2385,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2386,JOHN DRYDEN.,"21 Lawson amongst the foremost met his fate,"
2387,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whom sea-green Sirens from the rocks lament;
2388,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus as an offering for the Grecian state,"
2389,JOHN DRYDEN.,He first was kill'd who first to battle went.
2390,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2391,JOHN DRYDEN.,"22 Their chief blown up in air, not waves, expired,"
2392,JOHN DRYDEN.,To which his pride presumed to give the law:
2393,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The Dutch confess'd Heaven present, and retired,"
2394,JOHN DRYDEN.,And all was Britain the wide ocean saw.
2395,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2396,JOHN DRYDEN.,"23 To nearest ports their shatter'd ships repair,"
2397,JOHN DRYDEN.,Where by our dreadful cannon they lay awed:
2398,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So reverently men quit the open air,"
2399,JOHN DRYDEN.,When thunder speaks the angry gods abroad.
2400,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2401,JOHN DRYDEN.,"24 And now approach'd their fleet from India, fraught"
2402,JOHN DRYDEN.,With all the riches of the rising sun:
2403,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And precious sand from southern climates brought,"
2404,JOHN DRYDEN.,The fatal regions where the war begun.
2405,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2406,JOHN DRYDEN.,"25 Like hunted castors, conscious of their store,"
2407,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their waylaid wealth to Norway's coasts they bring:
2408,JOHN DRYDEN.,"There first the north's cold bosom spices bore,"
2409,JOHN DRYDEN.,And winter brooded on the eastern spring.
2410,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2411,JOHN DRYDEN.,"26 By the rich scent we found our perfumed prey,"
2412,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which, flank'd with rocks, did close in covert lie;"
2413,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And round about their murdering cannon lay,"
2414,JOHN DRYDEN.,At once to threaten and invite the eye.
2415,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2416,JOHN DRYDEN.,"27 Fiercer than cannon, and than rocks more hard,"
2417,JOHN DRYDEN.,The English undertake the unequal war:
2418,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Seven ships alone, by which the port is barr'd,"
2419,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Besiege the Indies, and all Denmark dare."
2420,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2421,JOHN DRYDEN.,"28 These fight like husbands, but like lovers those:"
2422,JOHN DRYDEN.,"These fain would keep, and those more fain enjoy:"
2423,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And to such height their frantic passion grows,"
2424,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That what both love, both hazard to destroy."
2425,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2426,JOHN DRYDEN.,"29 Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball,"
2427,JOHN DRYDEN.,And now their odours arm'd against them fly:
2428,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Some preciously by shatter'd porcelain fall,"
2429,JOHN DRYDEN.,And some by aromatic splinters die.
2430,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2431,JOHN DRYDEN.,"30 And though by tempests of the prize bereft,"
2432,JOHN DRYDEN.,In Heaven's inclemency some ease we find:
2433,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Our foes we vanquish'd by our valour left,"
2434,JOHN DRYDEN.,And only yielded to the seas and wind.
2435,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2436,JOHN DRYDEN.,31 Nor wholly lost[38] we so deserved a prey;
2437,JOHN DRYDEN.,For storms repenting part of it restored:
2438,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which, as a tribute from the Baltic sea,"
2439,JOHN DRYDEN.,The British ocean sent her mighty lord.
2440,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2441,JOHN DRYDEN.,"32 Go, mortals, now; and vex yourselves in vain"
2442,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For wealth, which so uncertainly must come:"
2443,JOHN DRYDEN.,"When what was brought so far, and with such pain,"
2444,JOHN DRYDEN.,Was only kept to lose it nearer home.
2445,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2446,JOHN DRYDEN.,"33 The son, who twice three months on th' ocean tost,"
2447,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Prepared to tell what he had pass'd before,"
2448,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now sees in English ships the Holland coast,"
2449,JOHN DRYDEN.,And parents' arms in vain stretch'd from the shore.
2450,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2451,JOHN DRYDEN.,"34 This careful husband had been long away,"
2452,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whom his chaste wife and little children mourn;
2453,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who on their fingers learn'd to tell the day
2454,JOHN DRYDEN.,On which their father promised to return.
2455,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2456,JOHN DRYDEN.,"35 Such are the proud designs of human kind,"
2457,JOHN DRYDEN.,And so we suffer shipwreck every where!
2458,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Alas, what port can such a pilot find,"
2459,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who in the night of fate must blindly steer!
2460,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2461,JOHN DRYDEN.,"36 The undistinguish'd seeds of good and ill,"
2462,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Heaven, in his bosom, from our knowledge hides:"
2463,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And draws them in contempt of human skill,"
2464,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which oft for friends mistaken foes provides.
2465,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2466,JOHN DRYDEN.,"37 Let Munster's prelate[39] ever be accurst,"
2467,JOHN DRYDEN.,In whom we seek the German faith in vain:
2468,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Alas, that he should teach the English first,"
2469,JOHN DRYDEN.,That fraud and avarice in the Church could reign!
2470,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2471,JOHN DRYDEN.,"38 Happy, who never trust a stranger's will,"
2472,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose friendship's in his interest understood!
2473,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Since money given but tempts him to be ill,"
2474,JOHN DRYDEN.,When power is too remote to make him good.
2475,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2476,JOHN DRYDEN.,"39 Till now, alone the mighty nations strove;"
2477,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The rest, at gaze, without the lists did stand:"
2478,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And threatening France, placed like a painted Jove,"
2479,JOHN DRYDEN.,Kept idle thunder in his lifted hand.
2480,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2481,JOHN DRYDEN.,"40 That eunuch guardian of rich Holland's trade,"
2482,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who envies us what he wants power to enjoy;
2483,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Whose noiseful valour does no foe invade,"
2484,JOHN DRYDEN.,And weak assistance will his friends destroy.
2485,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2486,JOHN DRYDEN.,"41 Offended that we fought without his leave,"
2487,JOHN DRYDEN.,He takes this time his secret hate to show:
2488,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which Charles does with a mind so calm receive,"
2489,JOHN DRYDEN.,As one that neither seeks nor shuns his foe.
2490,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2491,JOHN DRYDEN.,"42 With France, to aid the Dutch, the Danes unite:"
2492,JOHN DRYDEN.,"France as their tyrant, Denmark as their slave,"
2493,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But when with one three nations join to fight,"
2494,JOHN DRYDEN.,They silently confess that one more brave.
2495,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2496,JOHN DRYDEN.,43 Lewis had chased the English from his shore;
2497,JOHN DRYDEN.,But Charles the French as subjects does invite:
2498,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Would Heaven for each some Solomon restore,"
2499,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who, by their mercy, may decide their right!"
2500,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2501,JOHN DRYDEN.,"44 Were subjects so but only by their choice,"
2502,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And not from birth did forced dominion take,"
2503,JOHN DRYDEN.,Our prince alone would have the public voice;
2504,JOHN DRYDEN.,And all his neighbours' realms would deserts make.
2505,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2506,JOHN DRYDEN.,"45 He without fear a dangerous war pursues,"
2507,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which without rashness he began before:
2508,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As honour made him first the danger choose,"
2509,JOHN DRYDEN.,So still he makes it good on virtue's score.
2510,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2511,JOHN DRYDEN.,"46 The doubled charge his subjects' love supplies,"
2512,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who, in that bounty, to themselves are kind:"
2513,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So glad Egyptians see their Nilus rise,"
2514,JOHN DRYDEN.,And in his plenty their abundance find.
2515,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2516,JOHN DRYDEN.,"47 With equal power he does two chiefs[40] create,"
2517,JOHN DRYDEN.,Two such as each seem'd worthiest when alone;
2518,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Each able to sustain a nation's fate,"
2519,JOHN DRYDEN.,Since both had found a greater in their own.
2520,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2521,JOHN DRYDEN.,"48 Both great in courage, conduct, and in fame,"
2522,JOHN DRYDEN.,Yet neither envious of the other's praise;
2523,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their duty, faith, and interest too the same,"
2524,JOHN DRYDEN.,Like mighty partners equally they raise.
2525,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2526,JOHN DRYDEN.,"49 The prince long time had courted fortune's love,"
2527,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But once possess'd, did absolutely reign:"
2528,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus with their Amazons the heroes strove,"
2529,JOHN DRYDEN.,And conquer'd first those beauties they would gain.
2530,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2531,JOHN DRYDEN.,"50 The Duke beheld, like Scipio, with disdain,"
2532,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That Carthage, which he ruin'd, rise once more;"
2533,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And shook aloft the fasces of the main,"
2534,JOHN DRYDEN.,To fright those slaves with what they felt before.
2535,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2536,JOHN DRYDEN.,"51 Together to the watery camp they haste,"
2537,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whom matrons passing to their children show:
2538,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Infants' first vows for them to heaven are cast,"
2539,JOHN DRYDEN.,And future people bless them as they go.
2540,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2541,JOHN DRYDEN.,"52 With them no riotous pomp, nor Asian train,"
2542,JOHN DRYDEN.,To infect a navy with their gaudy fears;
2543,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To make slow fights, and victories but vain:"
2544,JOHN DRYDEN.,But war severely like itself appears.
2545,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2546,JOHN DRYDEN.,"53 Diffusive of themselves, where'er they pass,"
2547,JOHN DRYDEN.,They make that warmth in others they expect;
2548,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their valour works like bodies on a glass,"
2549,JOHN DRYDEN.,And does its image on their men project.
2550,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2551,JOHN DRYDEN.,"54 Our fleet divides, and straight the Dutch appear,"
2552,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In number, and a famed commander, bold:"
2553,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The narrow seas can scarce their navy bear,"
2554,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or crowded vessels can their soldiers hold.
2555,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2556,JOHN DRYDEN.,"55 The Duke, less numerous, but in courage more,"
2557,JOHN DRYDEN.,On wings of all the winds to combat flies:
2558,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His murdering guns a loud defiance roar,"
2559,JOHN DRYDEN.,And bloody crosses on his flag-staffs rise.
2560,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2561,JOHN DRYDEN.,"56 Both furl their sails, and strip them for the fight;"
2562,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their folded sheets dismiss the useless air:
2563,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The Elean plains could boast no nobler sight,"
2564,JOHN DRYDEN.,When struggling champions did their bodies bare.
2565,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2566,JOHN DRYDEN.,"57 Borne each by other in a distant line,"
2567,JOHN DRYDEN.,The sea-built forts in dreadful order move:
2568,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So vast the noise, as if not fleets did join,"
2569,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But lands unfix'd, and floating nations strove."
2570,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2571,JOHN DRYDEN.,"58 Now pass'd, on either side they nimbly tack;"
2572,JOHN DRYDEN.,Both strive to intercept and guide the wind:
2573,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, in its eye, more closely they come back,"
2574,JOHN DRYDEN.,To finish all the deaths they left behind.
2575,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2576,JOHN DRYDEN.,"59 On high-raised decks the haughty Belgians ride,"
2577,JOHN DRYDEN.,Beneath whose shade our humble frigates go:
2578,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Such port the elephant bears, and so defied"
2579,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By the rhinoceros, her unequal foe."
2580,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2581,JOHN DRYDEN.,"60 And as the build, so different is the fight;"
2582,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their mounting shot is on our sails design'd:
2583,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Deep in their hulls our deadly bullets light,"
2584,JOHN DRYDEN.,And through the yielding planks a passage find.
2585,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2586,JOHN DRYDEN.,"61 Our dreaded admiral from far they threat,"
2587,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose batter'd rigging their whole war receives:
2588,JOHN DRYDEN.,"All bare, like some old oak which tempests beat,"
2589,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He stands, and sees below his scatter'd leaves."
2590,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2591,JOHN DRYDEN.,"62 Heroes of old, when wounded, shelter sought;"
2592,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But he who meets all danger with disdain,"
2593,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Even in their face his ship to anchor brought,"
2594,JOHN DRYDEN.,And steeple-high stood propt upon the main.
2595,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2596,JOHN DRYDEN.,"63 At this excess of courage, all amazed,"
2597,JOHN DRYDEN.,The foremost of his foes awhile withdraw:
2598,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With such respect in enter'd Rome they gazed,"
2599,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who on high chairs the god-like fathers saw.
2600,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2601,JOHN DRYDEN.,"64 And now, as where Patroclus' body lay,"
2602,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Here Trojan chiefs advanced, and there the Greek"
2603,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Ours o'er the Duke their pious wings display,"
2604,JOHN DRYDEN.,And theirs the noblest spoils of Britain seek.
2605,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2606,JOHN DRYDEN.,"65 Meantime his busy mariners he hastes,"
2607,JOHN DRYDEN.,His shatter'd sails with rigging to restore;
2608,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And willing pines ascend his broken masts,"
2609,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose lofty heads rise higher than before.
2610,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2611,JOHN DRYDEN.,"66 Straight to the Dutch he turns his dreadful prow,"
2612,JOHN DRYDEN.,More fierce the important quarrel to decide:
2613,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Like swans, in long array his vessels show,"
2614,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose crests advancing do the waves divide.
2615,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2616,JOHN DRYDEN.,"67 They charge, recharge, and all along the sea"
2617,JOHN DRYDEN.,"They drive, and squander the huge Belgian fleet;"
2618,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Berkeley[41] alone, who nearest danger lay,"
2619,JOHN DRYDEN.,Did a like fate with lost Creusa meet.
2620,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2621,JOHN DRYDEN.,"68 The night comes on, we eager to pursue"
2622,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The combat still, and they ashamed to leave:"
2623,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Till the last streaks of dying day withdrew,"
2624,JOHN DRYDEN.,And doubtful moonlight did our rage deceive.
2625,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2626,JOHN DRYDEN.,"69 In the English fleet each ship resounds with joy,"
2627,JOHN DRYDEN.,And loud applause of their great leader's fame:
2628,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In fiery dreams the Dutch they still destroy,"
2629,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, slumbering, smile at the imagined flame."
2630,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2631,JOHN DRYDEN.,"70 Not so the Holland fleet, who, tired and done,"
2632,JOHN DRYDEN.,Stretch'd on their decks like weary oxen lie;
2633,JOHN DRYDEN.,Faint sweats all down their mighty members run;
2634,JOHN DRYDEN.,Vast bulks which little souls but ill supply.
2635,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2636,JOHN DRYDEN.,71 In dreams they fearful precipices tread:
2637,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or, shipwreck'd, labour to some distant shore:"
2638,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or in dark churches walk among the dead;
2639,JOHN DRYDEN.,"They wake with horror, and dare sleep no more."
2640,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2641,JOHN DRYDEN.,"72 The morn they look on with unwilling eyes,"
2642,JOHN DRYDEN.,Till from their main-top joyful news they hear
2643,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Of ships, which by their mould bring new supplies,"
2644,JOHN DRYDEN.,And in their colours Belgian lions bear.
2645,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2646,JOHN DRYDEN.,73 Our watchful general had discern'd from far
2647,JOHN DRYDEN.,"This mighty succour, which made glad the foe:"
2648,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He sigh'd, but, like a father of the war,"
2649,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His face spake hope, while deep his sorrows flow."
2650,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2651,JOHN DRYDEN.,"74 His wounded men he first sends off to shore,"
2652,JOHN DRYDEN.,Never till now unwilling to obey:
2653,JOHN DRYDEN.,"They, not their wounds, but want of strength deplore,"
2654,JOHN DRYDEN.,And think them happy who with him can stay.
2655,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2656,JOHN DRYDEN.,"75 Then to the rest, Rejoice, said he, to-day;"
2657,JOHN DRYDEN.,In you the fortune of Great Britain lies:
2658,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Among so brave a people, you are they"
2659,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whom Heaven has chose to fight for such a prize.
2660,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2661,JOHN DRYDEN.,"76 If number English courages could quell,"
2662,JOHN DRYDEN.,"We should at first have shunn'd, not met, our foes,"
2663,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose numerous sails the fearful only tell:
2664,JOHN DRYDEN.,Courage from hearts and not from numbers grows.
2665,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2666,JOHN DRYDEN.,"77 He said, nor needed more to say: with haste"
2667,JOHN DRYDEN.,To their known stations cheerfully they go;
2668,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And all at once, disdaining to be last,"
2669,JOHN DRYDEN.,Solicit every gale to meet the foe.
2670,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2671,JOHN DRYDEN.,"78 Nor did the encouraged Belgians long delay,"
2672,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But bold in others, not themselves, they stood:"
2673,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So thick, our navy scarce could steer their way,"
2674,JOHN DRYDEN.,But seem'd to wander in a moving wood.
2675,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2676,JOHN DRYDEN.,"79 Our little fleet was now engaged so far,"
2677,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That, like the sword-fish in the whale, they fought:"
2678,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The combat only seem'd a civil war,"
2679,JOHN DRYDEN.,Till through their bowels we our passage wrought.
2680,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2681,JOHN DRYDEN.,"80 Never had valour, no not ours, before"
2682,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Done aught like this upon the land or main,"
2683,JOHN DRYDEN.,Where not to be o'ercome was to do more
2684,JOHN DRYDEN.,Than all the conquests former kings did gain.
2685,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2686,JOHN DRYDEN.,"81 The mighty ghosts of our great Harries rose,"
2687,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And armed Edwards look'd with anxious eyes,"
2688,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To see this fleet among unequal foes,"
2689,JOHN DRYDEN.,By which fate promised them their Charles should rise.
2690,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2691,JOHN DRYDEN.,"82 Meantime the Belgians tack upon our rear,"
2692,JOHN DRYDEN.,And raking chase-guns through our sterns they send:
2693,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Close by their fire ships, like jackals appear"
2694,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who on their lions for the prey attend.
2695,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2696,JOHN DRYDEN.,83 Silent in smoke of cannon they come on:
2697,JOHN DRYDEN.,Such vapours once did fiery Cacus[42] hide:
2698,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In these the height of pleased revenge is shown,"
2699,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who burn contented by another's side.
2700,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2701,JOHN DRYDEN.,"84 Sometimes from fighting squadrons of each fleet,"
2702,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Deceived themselves, or to preserve some friend,"
2703,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Two grappling Ætnas on the ocean meet,"
2704,JOHN DRYDEN.,And English fires with Belgian flames contend.
2705,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2706,JOHN DRYDEN.,85 Now at each tack our little fleet grows less;
2707,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And like maim'd fowl, swim lagging on the main:"
2708,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their greater loss their numbers scarce confess,"
2709,JOHN DRYDEN.,While they lose cheaper than the English gain.
2710,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2711,JOHN DRYDEN.,"86 Have you not seen, when, whistled from the fist,"
2712,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Some falcon stoops at what her eye design'd,"
2713,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, with her eagerness the quarry miss'd,"
2714,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Straight flies at check, and clips it down the wind."
2715,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2716,JOHN DRYDEN.,"87 The dastard crow that to the wood made wing,"
2717,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And sees the groves no shelter can afford,"
2718,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With her loud caws her craven kind does bring,"
2719,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who, safe in numbers, cuff the noble bird."
2720,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2721,JOHN DRYDEN.,88 Among the Dutch thus Albemarle[43] did fare:
2722,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He could not conquer, and disdain'd to fly;"
2723,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Past hope of safety, 'twas his latest care,"
2724,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Like falling Cæsar, decently to die."
2725,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2726,JOHN DRYDEN.,"89 Yet pity did his manly spirit move,"
2727,JOHN DRYDEN.,To see those perish who so well had fought;
2728,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And generously with his despair he strove,"
2729,JOHN DRYDEN.,Resolved to live till he their safety wrought.
2730,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2731,JOHN DRYDEN.,"90 Let other muses write his prosperous fate,"
2732,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Of conquer'd nations tell, and kings restored;"
2733,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But mine shall sing of his eclipsed estate,"
2734,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which, like the sun's, more wonders does afford."
2735,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2736,JOHN DRYDEN.,"91 He drew his mighty frigates all before,"
2737,JOHN DRYDEN.,On which the foe his fruitless force employs:
2738,JOHN DRYDEN.,His weak ones deep into his rear he bore
2739,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Remote from guns, as sick men from the noise."
2740,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2741,JOHN DRYDEN.,"92 His fiery cannon did their passage guide,"
2742,JOHN DRYDEN.,And following smoke obscured them from the foe:
2743,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus Israel safe from the Egyptian's pride,"
2744,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By flaming pillars, and by clouds did go."
2745,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2746,JOHN DRYDEN.,"93 Elsewhere the Belgian force we did defeat,"
2747,JOHN DRYDEN.,But here our courages did theirs subdue:
2748,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So Xenophon once led that famed retreat,"
2749,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which first the Asian empire overthrew.
2750,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2751,JOHN DRYDEN.,94 The foe approach'd; and one for his bold sin
2752,JOHN DRYDEN.,Was sunk; as he that touch'd the ark was slain:
2753,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The wild waves master'd him and suck'd him in,"
2754,JOHN DRYDEN.,And smiling eddies dimpled on the main.
2755,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2756,JOHN DRYDEN.,"95 This seen, the rest at awful distance stood:"
2757,JOHN DRYDEN.,As if they had been there as servants set
2758,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To stay, or to go on, as he thought good,"
2759,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And not pursue, but wait on his retreat."
2760,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2761,JOHN DRYDEN.,"96 So Lybian huntsmen, on some sandy plain,"
2762,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From shady coverts roused, the lion chase:"
2763,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The kingly beast roars out with loud disdain,"
2764,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And slowly moves, unknowing to give place."
2765,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2766,JOHN DRYDEN.,"97 But if some one approach to dare his force,"
2767,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He swings his tail, and swiftly turns him round;"
2768,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With one paw seizes on his trembling horse,"
2769,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with the other tears him to the ground.
2770,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2771,JOHN DRYDEN.,98 Amidst these toils succeeds the balmy night;
2772,JOHN DRYDEN.,Now hissing waters the quench'd guns restore;
2773,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And weary waves, withdrawing from the fight,"
2774,JOHN DRYDEN.,Lie lull'd and panting on the silent shore:
2775,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2776,JOHN DRYDEN.,"99 The moon shone clear on the becalmed flood,"
2777,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where, while her beams like glittering silver play,"
2778,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Upon the deck our careful general stood,"
2779,JOHN DRYDEN.,And deeply mused on the succeeding day.
2780,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2781,JOHN DRYDEN.,"100 That happy sun, said he, will rise again,"
2782,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who twice victorious did our navy see:
2783,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And I alone must view him rise in vain,"
2784,JOHN DRYDEN.,Without one ray of all his star for me.
2785,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2786,JOHN DRYDEN.,"101 Yet like an English general will I die,"
2787,JOHN DRYDEN.,And all the ocean make my spacious grave:
2788,JOHN DRYDEN.,Women and cowards on the land may lie;
2789,JOHN DRYDEN.,The sea's a tomb that's proper for the brave.
2790,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2791,JOHN DRYDEN.,"102 Restless he pass'd the remnant of the night,"
2792,JOHN DRYDEN.,Till the fresh air proclaimed the morning nigh:
2793,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And burning ships, the martyrs of the fight,"
2794,JOHN DRYDEN.,With paler fires beheld the eastern sky.
2795,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2796,JOHN DRYDEN.,"103 But now, his stores of ammunition spent,"
2797,JOHN DRYDEN.,His naked valour is his only guard;
2798,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rare thunders are from his dumb cannon sent,"
2799,JOHN DRYDEN.,And solitary guns are scarcely heard.
2800,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2801,JOHN DRYDEN.,"104 Thus far had fortune power, here forced to stay,"
2802,JOHN DRYDEN.,Nor longer durst with virtue be at strife:
2803,JOHN DRYDEN.,"This as a ransom Albemarle did pay,"
2804,JOHN DRYDEN.,For all the glories of so great a life.
2805,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2806,JOHN DRYDEN.,"105 For now brave Rupert from afar appears,"
2807,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose waving streamers the glad general knows:
2808,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With full spread sails his eager navy steers,"
2809,JOHN DRYDEN.,And every ship in swift proportion grows.
2810,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2811,JOHN DRYDEN.,"106 The anxious prince had heard the cannon long,"
2812,JOHN DRYDEN.,And from that length of time dire omens drew
2813,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Of English overmatch'd, and Dutch too strong,"
2814,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who never fought three days, but to pursue."
2815,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2816,JOHN DRYDEN.,"107 Then, as an eagle, who, with pious care"
2817,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Was beating widely on the wing for prey,"
2818,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To her now silent eyrie does repair,"
2819,JOHN DRYDEN.,And finds her callow infants forced away:
2820,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2821,JOHN DRYDEN.,"108 Stung with her love, she stoops upon the plain,"
2822,JOHN DRYDEN.,The broken air loud whistling as she flies:
2823,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She stops and listens, and shoots forth again,"
2824,JOHN DRYDEN.,And guides her pinions by her young ones' cries.
2825,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2826,JOHN DRYDEN.,"109 With such kind passion hastes the prince to fight,"
2827,JOHN DRYDEN.,And spreads his flying canvas to the sound;
2828,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Him, whom no danger, were he there, could fright,"
2829,JOHN DRYDEN.,Now absent every little noise can wound.
2830,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2831,JOHN DRYDEN.,"110 As in a drought the thirsty creatures cry,"
2832,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And gape upon the gather'd clouds for rain,"
2833,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And first the martlet meets it in the sky,"
2834,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with wet wings joys all the feather'd train.
2835,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2836,JOHN DRYDEN.,111 With such glad hearts did our despairing men
2837,JOHN DRYDEN.,Salute the appearance of the prince's fleet;
2838,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And each ambitiously would claim the ken,"
2839,JOHN DRYDEN.,That with first eyes did distant safety meet.
2840,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2841,JOHN DRYDEN.,"112 The Dutch, who came like greedy hinds before,"
2842,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield,"
2843,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now look like those, when rolling thunders roar,"
2844,JOHN DRYDEN.,And sheets of lightning blast the standing field.
2845,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2846,JOHN DRYDEN.,"113 Full in the prince's passage, hills of sand,"
2847,JOHN DRYDEN.,And dangerous flats in secret ambush lay;
2848,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where the false tides skim o'er the cover'd land,"
2849,JOHN DRYDEN.,And seamen with dissembled depths betray.
2850,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2851,JOHN DRYDEN.,"114 The wily Dutch, who, like fallen angels, fear'd"
2852,JOHN DRYDEN.,"This new Messiah's coming, there did wait,"
2853,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And round the verge their braving vessels steer'd,"
2854,JOHN DRYDEN.,To tempt his courage with so fair a bait.
2855,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2856,JOHN DRYDEN.,"115 But he, unmoved, contemns their idle threat,"
2857,JOHN DRYDEN.,Secure of fame whene'er he please to fight:
2858,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His cold experience tempers all his heat,"
2859,JOHN DRYDEN.,And inbred worth doth boasting valour slight.
2860,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2861,JOHN DRYDEN.,"116 Heroic virtue did his actions guide,"
2862,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And he the substance, not the appearance chose"
2863,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To rescue one such friend he took more pride,"
2864,JOHN DRYDEN.,Than to destroy whole thousands of such foes.
2865,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2866,JOHN DRYDEN.,"117 But when approach'd, in strict embraces bound,"
2867,JOHN DRYDEN.,Rupert and Albemarle together grow;
2868,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He joys to have his friend in safety found,"
2869,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which he to none but to that friend would owe.
2870,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2871,JOHN DRYDEN.,"118 The cheerful soldiers, with new stores supplied,"
2872,JOHN DRYDEN.,Now long to execute their spleenful will;
2873,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, in revenge for those three days they tried,"
2874,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Wish one, like Joshua's, when the sun stood still."
2875,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2876,JOHN DRYDEN.,"119 Thus reinforced, against the adverse fleet,"
2877,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Still doubling ours, brave Rupert leads the way:"
2878,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With the first blushes of the morn they meet,"
2879,JOHN DRYDEN.,And bring night back upon the new-born day.
2880,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2881,JOHN DRYDEN.,"120 His presence soon blows up the kindling fight,"
2882,JOHN DRYDEN.,And his loud guns speak thick like angry men:
2883,JOHN DRYDEN.,"It seem'd as slaughter had been breathed all night,"
2884,JOHN DRYDEN.,And Death new pointed his dull dart again.
2885,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2886,JOHN DRYDEN.,"121 The Dutch too well his mighty conduct knew,"
2887,JOHN DRYDEN.,And matchless courage since the former fight;
2888,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Whose navy like a stiff-stretch'd cord did show,"
2889,JOHN DRYDEN.,Till he bore in and bent them into flight.
2890,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2891,JOHN DRYDEN.,"122 The wind he shares, while half their fleet offends"
2892,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His open side, and high above him shows:"
2893,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Upon the rest at pleasure he descends,"
2894,JOHN DRYDEN.,And doubly harm'd he double harms bestows.
2895,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2896,JOHN DRYDEN.,"123 Behind the general mends his weary pace,"
2897,JOHN DRYDEN.,And sullenly to his revenge he sails:
2898,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So glides some trodden serpent on the grass,"
2899,JOHN DRYDEN.,And long behind his wounded volume trails.
2900,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2901,JOHN DRYDEN.,"124 The increasing sound is borne to either shore,"
2902,JOHN DRYDEN.,And for their stakes the throwing nations fear:
2903,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their passions double with the cannons' roar,"
2904,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with warm wishes each man combats there.
2905,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2906,JOHN DRYDEN.,"125 Plied thick and close as when the fight begun,"
2907,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their huge unwieldy navy wastes away;
2908,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So sicken waning moons too near the sun,"
2909,JOHN DRYDEN.,And blunt their crescents on the edge of day.
2910,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2911,JOHN DRYDEN.,"126 And now reduced on equal terms to fight,"
2912,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their ships like wasted patrimonies show;
2913,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where the thin scattering trees admit the light,"
2914,JOHN DRYDEN.,And shun each other's shadows as they grow.
2915,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2916,JOHN DRYDEN.,127 The warlike prince had sever'd from the rest
2917,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Two giant ships, the pride of all the main;"
2918,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which with his one so vigorously he prest,"
2919,JOHN DRYDEN.,And flew so home they could not rise again.
2920,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2921,JOHN DRYDEN.,"128 Already batter'd, by his lee they lay,"
2922,JOHN DRYDEN.,In rain upon the passing winds they call:
2923,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The passing winds through their torn canvas play,"
2924,JOHN DRYDEN.,And flagging sails on heartless sailors fall.
2925,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2926,JOHN DRYDEN.,"129 Their open'd sides receive a gloomy light,"
2927,JOHN DRYDEN.,Dreadful as day let into shades below:
2928,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Without, grim Death rides barefaced in their sight,"
2929,JOHN DRYDEN.,And urges entering billows as they flow.
2930,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2931,JOHN DRYDEN.,"130 When one dire shot, the last they could supply,"
2932,JOHN DRYDEN.,Close by the board the prince's mainmast bore:
2933,JOHN DRYDEN.,"All three now helpless by each other lie,"
2934,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And this offends not, and those fear no more."
2935,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2936,JOHN DRYDEN.,131 So have I seen some fearful hare maintain
2937,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A course, till tired before the dog she lay:"
2938,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who, stretch'd behind her, pants upon the plain,"
2939,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Past power to kill, as she to get away."
2940,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2941,JOHN DRYDEN.,132 With his loll'd tongue he faintly licks his prey;
2942,JOHN DRYDEN.,His warm breath blows her flix[44] up as she lies;
2943,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She trembling creeps upon the ground away,"
2944,JOHN DRYDEN.,And looks back to him with beseeching eyes.
2945,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2946,JOHN DRYDEN.,"133 The prince unjustly does his stars accuse,"
2947,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which hinder'd him to push his fortune on;
2948,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For what they to his courage did refuse,"
2949,JOHN DRYDEN.,By mortal valour never must be done.
2950,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2951,JOHN DRYDEN.,"134 This lucky hour the wise Batavian takes,"
2952,JOHN DRYDEN.,And warns his tatter'd fleet to follow home;
2953,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Proud to have so got off with equal stakes,"
2954,JOHN DRYDEN.,Where 'twas a triumph not to be o'ercome.
2955,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2956,JOHN DRYDEN.,"135 The general's force, as kept alive by fight,"
2957,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now not opposed, no longer can pursue:"
2958,JOHN DRYDEN.,Lasting till heaven had done his courage right;
2959,JOHN DRYDEN.,When he had conquer'd he his weakness knew.
2960,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2961,JOHN DRYDEN.,"136 He casts a frown on the departing foe,"
2962,JOHN DRYDEN.,And sighs to see him quit the watery field:
2963,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His stern fix'd eyes no satisfaction show,"
2964,JOHN DRYDEN.,For all the glories which the fight did yield.
2965,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2966,JOHN DRYDEN.,"137 Though, as when fiends did miracles avow,"
2967,JOHN DRYDEN.,He stands confess'd e'en by the boastful Dutch:
2968,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He only does his conquest disavow,"
2969,JOHN DRYDEN.,And thinks too little what they found too much.
2970,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2971,JOHN DRYDEN.,"138 Return'd, he with the fleet resolved to stay;"
2972,JOHN DRYDEN.,No tender thoughts of home his heart divide;
2973,JOHN DRYDEN.,Domestic joys and cares he puts away;
2974,JOHN DRYDEN.,For realms are households which the great must guide.
2975,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2976,JOHN DRYDEN.,"139 As those who unripe veins in mines explore,"
2977,JOHN DRYDEN.,"On the rich bed again the warm turf lay,"
2978,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Till time digests the yet imperfect ore,"
2979,JOHN DRYDEN.,And know it will be gold another day:
2980,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2981,JOHN DRYDEN.,"140 So looks our monarch on this early fight,"
2982,JOHN DRYDEN.,Th' essay and rudiments of great success;
2983,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which all-maturing time must bring to light,"
2984,JOHN DRYDEN.,"While he, like Heaven, does each day's labour bless."
2985,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2986,JOHN DRYDEN.,"141 Heaven ended not the first or second day,"
2987,JOHN DRYDEN.,Yet each was perfect to the work design'd;
2988,JOHN DRYDEN.,"God and king's work, when they their work survey,"
2989,JOHN DRYDEN.,A passive aptness in all subjects find.
2990,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2991,JOHN DRYDEN.,"142 In burden'd vessels first, with speedy care,"
2992,JOHN DRYDEN.,His plenteous stores do seasoned timber send;
2993,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thither the brawny carpenters repair,"
2994,JOHN DRYDEN.,And as the surgeons of maim'd ships attend.
2995,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2996,JOHN DRYDEN.,"143 With cord and canvas from rich Hamburgh sent,"
2997,JOHN DRYDEN.,His navy's molted wings he imps once more:
2998,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Tall Norway fir, their masts in battle spent,"
2999,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And English oak, sprung leaks and planks restore."
3000,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3001,JOHN DRYDEN.,"144 All hands employ'd, the royal work grows warm:"
3002,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Like labouring bees on a long summer's day,"
3003,JOHN DRYDEN.,Some sound the trumpet for the rest to swarm.
3004,JOHN DRYDEN.,And some on bells of tasted lilies play.
3005,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3006,JOHN DRYDEN.,145 With gluey wax some new foundations lay
3007,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Of virgin-combs, which from the roof are hung:"
3008,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Some arm'd, within doors upon duty stay,"
3009,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or tend the sick, or educate the young."
3010,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3011,JOHN DRYDEN.,"146 So here some pick out bullets from the sides,"
3012,JOHN DRYDEN.,Some drive old oakum through each seam and rift:
3013,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their left hand does the calking-iron guide,"
3014,JOHN DRYDEN.,The rattling mallet with the right they lift.
3015,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3016,JOHN DRYDEN.,"147 With boiling pitch another near at hand,"
3017,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From friendly Sweden brought, the seams instops:"
3018,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which well paid o'er, the salt sea waves withstand,"
3019,JOHN DRYDEN.,And shakes them from the rising beak in drops.
3020,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3021,JOHN DRYDEN.,"148 Some the gall'd ropes with dauby marline bind,"
3022,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or sear-cloth masts with strong tarpaulin coats:
3023,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To try new shrouds one mounts into the wind,"
3024,JOHN DRYDEN.,And one below their ease or stiffness notes.
3025,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3026,JOHN DRYDEN.,"149 Our careful monarch stands in person by,"
3027,JOHN DRYDEN.,His new-cast cannons' firmness to explore:
3028,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The strength of big-corn'd powder loves to try,"
3029,JOHN DRYDEN.,And ball and cartridge sorts for every bore.
3030,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3031,JOHN DRYDEN.,"150 Each day brings fresh supplies of arms and men,"
3032,JOHN DRYDEN.,And ships which all last winter were abroad;
3033,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And such as fitted since the fight had been,"
3034,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or, new from stocks, were fallen into the road."
3035,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3036,JOHN DRYDEN.,151 The goodly London in her gallant trim
3037,JOHN DRYDEN.,(The Phoenix daughter of the vanish'd old).
3038,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Like a rich bride does to the ocean swim,"
3039,JOHN DRYDEN.,And on her shadow rides in floating gold.
3040,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3041,JOHN DRYDEN.,"152 Her flag aloft spread ruffling to the wind,"
3042,JOHN DRYDEN.,And sanguine streamers seem the flood to fire;
3043,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The weaver, charm'd with what his loom design'd,"
3044,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Goes on to sea, and knows not to retire."
3045,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3046,JOHN DRYDEN.,"153 With roomy decks, her guns of mighty strength,"
3047,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves;
3048,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Deep in her draught, and warlike in her length,"
3049,JOHN DRYDEN.,She seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves.
3050,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3051,JOHN DRYDEN.,"154 This martial present, piously design'd,"
3052,JOHN DRYDEN.,The loyal city give their best-loved King:
3053,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And with a bounty ample as the wind,"
3054,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Built, fitted, and maintain'd, to aid him bring."
3055,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3056,JOHN DRYDEN.,"155 By viewing Nature, Nature's handmaid, Art,"
3057,JOHN DRYDEN.,Makes mighty things from small beginnings grow:
3058,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus fishes first to shipping did impart,"
3059,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their tail the rudder, and their head the prow."
3060,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3061,JOHN DRYDEN.,"156 Some log perhaps upon the waters swam,"
3062,JOHN DRYDEN.,"An useless drift, which, rudely cut within,"
3063,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, hollow'd, first a floating trough became,"
3064,JOHN DRYDEN.,And cross some rivulet passage did begin.
3065,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3066,JOHN DRYDEN.,"157 In shipping such as this, the Irish kern,"
3067,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And untaught Indian, on the stream did glide:"
3068,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Ere sharp-keel'd boats to stem the flood did learn,"
3069,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or fin-like oars did spread from either side.
3070,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3071,JOHN DRYDEN.,"158 Add but a sail, and Saturn so appear'd,"
3072,JOHN DRYDEN.,"When from lost empire he to exile went,"
3073,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And with the golden age to Tiber steer'd,"
3074,JOHN DRYDEN.,Where coin and commerce first he did invent.
3075,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3076,JOHN DRYDEN.,159 Rude as their ships was navigation then;
3077,JOHN DRYDEN.,No useful compass or meridian known;
3078,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Coasting, they kept the land within their ken,"
3079,JOHN DRYDEN.,And knew no North but when the Pole-star shone.
3080,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3081,JOHN DRYDEN.,"160 Of all who since have used the open sea,"
3082,JOHN DRYDEN.,Than the bold English none more fame have won:
3083,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Beyond the year, and out of heaven's high way,"
3084,JOHN DRYDEN.,They make discoveries where they see no sun.
3085,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3086,JOHN DRYDEN.,"161 But what so long in vain, and yet unknown,"
3087,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By poor mankind's benighted wit is sought,"
3088,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shall in this age to Britain first be shown,"
3089,JOHN DRYDEN.,And hence be to admiring nations taught.
3090,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3091,JOHN DRYDEN.,"162 The ebbs of tides and their mysterious flow,"
3092,JOHN DRYDEN.,"We, as art's elements, shall understand,"
3093,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And as by line upon the ocean go,"
3094,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose paths shall be familiar as the land.
3095,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3096,JOHN DRYDEN.,"163 Instructed ships shall sail to quick commerce,"
3097,JOHN DRYDEN.,By which remotest regions are allied;
3098,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which makes one city of the universe,"
3099,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where some may gain, and all may be supplied."
3100,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3101,JOHN DRYDEN.,"164 Then we upon our globe's last verge shall go,"
3102,JOHN DRYDEN.,And view the ocean leaning on the sky:
3103,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know,"
3104,JOHN DRYDEN.,And on the lunar world securely pry.
3105,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3106,JOHN DRYDEN.,"165 This I foretell from your auspicious care,"
3107,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who great in search of God and nature grow;
3108,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who best your wise Creator's praise declare,"
3109,JOHN DRYDEN.,Since best to praise his works is best to know.
3110,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3111,JOHN DRYDEN.,166 O truly royal! who behold the law
3112,JOHN DRYDEN.,And rule of beings in your Maker's mind:
3113,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And thence, like limbecks, rich ideas draw,"
3114,JOHN DRYDEN.,To fit the levell'd use of human-kind.
3115,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3116,JOHN DRYDEN.,"197 But first the toils of war we must endure,"
3117,JOHN DRYDEN.,And from the injurious Dutch redeem the seas.
3118,JOHN DRYDEN.,"War makes the valiant of his right secure,"
3119,JOHN DRYDEN.,And gives up fraud to be chastised with ease.
3120,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3121,JOHN DRYDEN.,"168 Already were the Belgians on our coast,"
3122,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose fleet more mighty every day became
3123,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By late success, which they did falsely boast,"
3124,JOHN DRYDEN.,And now by first appearing seem'd to claim.
3125,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3126,JOHN DRYDEN.,"169 Designing, subtle, diligent, and close,"
3127,JOHN DRYDEN.,They knew to manage war with wise delay:
3128,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Yet all those arts their vanity did cross,"
3129,JOHN DRYDEN.,And by their pride their prudence did betray.
3130,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3131,JOHN DRYDEN.,"170 Nor stay'd the English long; but, well supplied,"
3132,JOHN DRYDEN.,Appear as numerous as the insulting foe:
3133,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The combat now by courage must be tried,"
3134,JOHN DRYDEN.,And the success the braver nation show.
3135,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3136,JOHN DRYDEN.,"171 There was the Plymouth squadron now come in,"
3137,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which in the Straits last winter was abroad;
3138,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which twice on Biscay's working bay had been,"
3139,JOHN DRYDEN.,And on the midland sea the French had awed.
3140,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3141,JOHN DRYDEN.,"172 Old expert Allen,[45] loyal all along,"
3142,JOHN DRYDEN.,Famed for his action on the Smyrna fleet:
3143,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And Holmes, whose name shall live in epic song,"
3144,JOHN DRYDEN.,"While music numbers, or while verse has feet."
3145,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3146,JOHN DRYDEN.,"173 Holmes, the Achates of the general's fight;"
3147,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who first bewitch'd our eyes with Guinea gold;
3148,JOHN DRYDEN.,As once old Cato in the Roman sight
3149,JOHN DRYDEN.,The tempting fruits of Afric did unfold.
3150,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3151,JOHN DRYDEN.,"174 With him went Spragge, as bountiful as brave,"
3152,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whom his high courage to command had brought:
3153,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Harman, who did the twice-fired Harry save,"
3154,JOHN DRYDEN.,And in his burning ship undaunted fought.
3155,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3156,JOHN DRYDEN.,"175 Young Hollis, on a Muse by Mars begot,"
3157,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Born, Cæsar-like, to write and act great deeds:"
3158,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Impatient to revenge his fatal shot,"
3159,JOHN DRYDEN.,His right hand doubly to his left succeeds.
3160,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3161,JOHN DRYDEN.,"176 Thousands were there in darker fame that dwell,"
3162,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose deeds some nobler poem shall adorn:
3163,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, though to me unknown, they sure fought well"
3164,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Whom Rupert led, and who were British born."
3165,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3166,JOHN DRYDEN.,177 Of every size an hundred fighting sail:
3167,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So vast the navy now at anchor rides,"
3168,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That underneath it the press'd waters fail,"
3169,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with its weight it shoulders off the tides.
3170,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3171,JOHN DRYDEN.,"178 Now anchors weigh'd, the seamen shout so shrill,"
3172,JOHN DRYDEN.,That heaven and earth and the wide ocean rings:
3173,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A breeze from westward waits their sails to fill,"
3174,JOHN DRYDEN.,And rests in those high beds his downy wings.
3175,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3176,JOHN DRYDEN.,"179 The wary Dutch this gathering storm foresaw,"
3177,JOHN DRYDEN.,And durst not bide it on the English coast:
3178,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Behind their treacherous shallows they withdraw,"
3179,JOHN DRYDEN.,And there lay snares to catch the British host.
3180,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3181,JOHN DRYDEN.,"180 So the false spider, when her nets are spread,"
3182,JOHN DRYDEN.,Deep ambush'd in her silent den does lie:
3183,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And feels far off the trembling of her thread,"
3184,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly.
3185,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3186,JOHN DRYDEN.,"181 Then if at last she find him fast beset,"
3187,JOHN DRYDEN.,She issues forth and runs along her loom:
3188,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She joys to touch the captive in her net,"
3189,JOHN DRYDEN.,And drags the little wretch in triumph home.
3190,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3191,JOHN DRYDEN.,"182 The Belgians hoped, that, with disorder'd haste,"
3192,JOHN DRYDEN.,Our deep-cut keels upon the sands might run:
3193,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or, if with caution leisurely were past,"
3194,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their numerous gross might charge us one by one.
3195,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3196,JOHN DRYDEN.,"183 But with a fore-wind pushing them above,"
3197,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And swelling tide that heaved them from below,"
3198,JOHN DRYDEN.,"O'er the blind flats our warlike squadrons move,"
3199,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with spread sails to welcome battle go.
3200,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3201,JOHN DRYDEN.,"184 It seem'd as there the British Neptune stood,"
3202,JOHN DRYDEN.,With all his hosts of waters at command.
3203,JOHN DRYDEN.,Beneath them to submit the officious flood;
3204,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with his trident shoved them off the sand.
3205,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3206,JOHN DRYDEN.,"185 To the pale foes they suddenly draw near,"
3207,JOHN DRYDEN.,And summon them to unexpected fight:
3208,JOHN DRYDEN.,"They start like murderers when ghosts appear,"
3209,JOHN DRYDEN.,And draw their curtains in the dead of night.
3210,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3211,JOHN DRYDEN.,"186 Now van to van the foremost squadrons meet,"
3212,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The midmost battles hastening up behind,"
3213,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who view far off the storm of falling sleet,"
3214,JOHN DRYDEN.,And hear their thunder rattling in the wind.
3215,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3216,JOHN DRYDEN.,187 At length the adverse admirals appear;
3217,JOHN DRYDEN.,The two bold champions of each country's right:
3218,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their eyes describe the lists as they come near,"
3219,JOHN DRYDEN.,And draw the lines of death before they fight.
3220,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3221,JOHN DRYDEN.,"188 The distance judged for shot of every size,"
3222,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The linstocks touch, the ponderous ball expires:"
3223,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The vigorous seaman every port-hole plies,"
3224,JOHN DRYDEN.,And adds his heart to every gun he fires!
3225,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3226,JOHN DRYDEN.,"189 Fierce was the fight on the proud Belgians' side,"
3227,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For honour, which they seldom sought before!"
3228,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But now they by their own vain boasts were tied,"
3229,JOHN DRYDEN.,And forced at least in show to prize it more.
3230,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3231,JOHN DRYDEN.,"190 But sharp remembrance on the English part,"
3232,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And shame of being match'd by such a foe,"
3233,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rouse conscious virtue up in every heart,"
3234,JOHN DRYDEN.,And seeming to be stronger makes them so.
3235,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3236,JOHN DRYDEN.,"191  Nor long the Belgians could that fleet sustain,"
3237,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which did two generals' fates, and Cæsar's bear:"
3238,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Each several ship a victory did gain,"
3239,JOHN DRYDEN.,As Rupert or as Albemarle were there.
3240,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3241,JOHN DRYDEN.,"192 Their batter'd admiral too soon withdrew,"
3242,JOHN DRYDEN.,Unthank'd by ours for his unfinish'd fight;
3243,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But he the minds of his Dutch masters knew,"
3244,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who call'd that Providence which we call'd flight.
3245,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3246,JOHN DRYDEN.,"193 Never did men more joyfully obey,"
3247,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or sooner understood the sign to fly:
3248,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With such alacrity they bore away,"
3249,JOHN DRYDEN.,As if to praise them all the States stood by.
3250,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3251,JOHN DRYDEN.,"194 O famous leader[46] of the Belgian fleet,"
3252,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thy monument inscribed such praise shall wear,"
3253,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As Varro, timely flying, once did meet,"
3254,JOHN DRYDEN.,Because he did not of his Rome despair.
3255,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3256,JOHN DRYDEN.,"195 Behold that navy, which a while before,"
3257,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Provoked the tardy English close to fight,"
3258,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now draw their beaten vessels close to shore,"
3259,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As larks lie, dared, to shun the hobby's flight."
3260,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3261,JOHN DRYDEN.,"196 Whoe'er would English monuments survey,"
3262,JOHN DRYDEN.,In other records may our courage know:
3263,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But let them hide the story of this day,"
3264,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose fame was blemish'd by too base a foe.
3265,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3266,JOHN DRYDEN.,197 Or if too busily they will inquire
3267,JOHN DRYDEN.,Into a victory which we disdain;
3268,JOHN DRYDEN.,Then let them know the Belgians did retire
3269,JOHN DRYDEN.,Before the patron saint[47] of injured Spain.
3270,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3271,JOHN DRYDEN.,198 Repenting England this revengeful day
3272,JOHN DRYDEN.,To Philip's manes did an offering bring:
3273,JOHN DRYDEN.,"England, which first by leading them astray,"
3274,JOHN DRYDEN.,Hatch'd up rebellion to destroy her King.
3275,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3276,JOHN DRYDEN.,"199 Our fathers bent their baneful industry,"
3277,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To check a, monarchy that slowly grew;"
3278,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But did not France or Holland's fate foresee,"
3279,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose rising power to swift dominion flew.
3280,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3281,JOHN DRYDEN.,"200 In fortune's empire blindly thus we go,"
3282,JOHN DRYDEN.,And wander after pathless destiny;
3283,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Whose dark resorts since prudence cannot know,"
3284,JOHN DRYDEN.,In vain it would provide for what shall be.
3285,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3286,JOHN DRYDEN.,"201 But whate'er English to the bless'd shall go,"
3287,JOHN DRYDEN.,And the fourth Harry or first Orange meet;
3288,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Find him disowning of a Bourbon foe,"
3289,JOHN DRYDEN.,And him detesting a Batavian fleet.
3290,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3291,JOHN DRYDEN.,"202 Now on their coasts our conquering navy rides,"
3292,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Waylays their merchants, and their land besets:"
3293,JOHN DRYDEN.,Each day new wealth without their care provides;
3294,JOHN DRYDEN.,They lie asleep with prizes in their nets.
3295,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3296,JOHN DRYDEN.,"203 So, close behind some promontory lie"
3297,JOHN DRYDEN.,The huge leviathans to attend their prey;
3298,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And give no chase, but swallow in the fry,"
3299,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way.
3300,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3301,JOHN DRYDEN.,"204 Nor was this all: in ports and roads remote,"
3302,JOHN DRYDEN.,Destructive fires among whole fleets we send:
3303,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Triumphant flames upon the water float,"
3304,JOHN DRYDEN.,And out-bound ships at home their voyage end.
3305,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3306,JOHN DRYDEN.,"205 Those various squadrons variously design'd,"
3307,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Each vessel freighted with a several load,"
3308,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Each squadron waiting for a several wind,"
3309,JOHN DRYDEN.,"All find but one, to burn them in the road."
3310,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3311,JOHN DRYDEN.,"206 Some bound for Guinea, golden sand to find,"
3312,JOHN DRYDEN.,Bore all the gauds the simple natives wear;
3313,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Some for the pride of Turkish courts design'd,"
3314,JOHN DRYDEN.,For folded turbans finest Holland bear.
3315,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3316,JOHN DRYDEN.,"207 Some English wool, vex'd in a Belgian loom,"
3317,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And into cloth of spungy softness made,"
3318,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Did into France, or colder Denmark, doom,"
3319,JOHN DRYDEN.,To ruin with worse ware our staple trade.
3320,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3321,JOHN DRYDEN.,"208 Our greedy seamen rummage every hold,"
3322,JOHN DRYDEN.,Smile on the booty of each wealthier chest;
3323,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, as the priests who with their gods make bold,"
3324,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Take what they like, and sacrifice the rest."
3325,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3326,JOHN DRYDEN.,209 But ah! how insincere are all our joys!
3327,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which, sent from heaven, like lightning make no stay;"
3328,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their palling taste the journey's length destroys,"
3329,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or grief, sent post, o'ertakes them on the way."
3330,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3331,JOHN DRYDEN.,"210 Swell'd with our late successes on the foe,"
3332,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which France and Holland wanted power to cross,"
3333,JOHN DRYDEN.,"We urge an unseen fate to lay us low,"
3334,JOHN DRYDEN.,And feed their envious eyes with English loss.
3335,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3336,JOHN DRYDEN.,"211 Each element His dread command obeys,"
3337,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who makes or ruins with a smile or frown;
3338,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who, as by one he did our nation raise,"
3339,JOHN DRYDEN.,So now he with another pulls us down.
3340,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3341,JOHN DRYDEN.,"212 Yet London, empress of the northern clime,"
3342,JOHN DRYDEN.,By an high fate thou greatly didst expire;
3343,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Great as the world's, which, at the death of time"
3344,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Must fall, and rise a nobler frame by fire!"
3345,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3346,JOHN DRYDEN.,"213 As when some dire usurper[48] Heaven provides,"
3347,JOHN DRYDEN.,To scourge his country with a lawless sway;
3348,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His birth perhaps some petty village hides,"
3349,JOHN DRYDEN.,And sets his cradle out of fortune's way.
3350,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3351,JOHN DRYDEN.,"214 Till fully ripe his swelling fate breaks out,"
3352,JOHN DRYDEN.,And hurries him to mighty mischiefs on:
3353,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His prince, surprised at first, no ill could doubt,"
3354,JOHN DRYDEN.,And wants the power to meet it when 'tis known.
3355,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3356,JOHN DRYDEN.,"215 Such was the rise of this prodigious fire,"
3357,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which, in mean buildings first obscurely bred,"
3358,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From thence did soon to open streets aspire,"
3359,JOHN DRYDEN.,And straight to palaces and temples spread.
3360,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3361,JOHN DRYDEN.,"216 The diligence of trades and noiseful gain,"
3362,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And luxury more late, asleep were laid:"
3363,JOHN DRYDEN.,All was the night's; and in her silent reign
3364,JOHN DRYDEN.,No sound the rest of nature did invade.
3365,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3366,JOHN DRYDEN.,"217 In this deep quiet, from what source unknown,"
3367,JOHN DRYDEN.,Those seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose;
3368,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And first few scattering sparks about were blown,"
3369,JOHN DRYDEN.,Big with the flames that to our ruin rose.
3370,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3371,JOHN DRYDEN.,"218 Then in some close-pent room it crept along,"
3372,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, smouldering as it went, in silence fed;"
3373,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Till the infant monster, with devouring strong,"
3374,JOHN DRYDEN.,Walk'd boldly upright with exalted head.
3375,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3376,JOHN DRYDEN.,"219 Now like some rich or mighty murderer,"
3377,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Too great for prison, which he breaks with gold;"
3378,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who fresher for new mischiefs does appear,"
3379,JOHN DRYDEN.,And dares the world to tax him with the old:
3380,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3381,JOHN DRYDEN.,"220 So 'scapes the insulting fire his narrow jail,"
3382,JOHN DRYDEN.,And makes small outlets into open air:
3383,JOHN DRYDEN.,"There the fierce winds his tender force assail,"
3384,JOHN DRYDEN.,And beat him downward to his first repair.
3385,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3386,JOHN DRYDEN.,"221 The winds, like crafty courtesans, withheld"
3387,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His flames from burning, but to blow them more:"
3388,JOHN DRYDEN.,And every fresh attempt he is repell'd
3389,JOHN DRYDEN.,With faint denials weaker than before.
3390,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3391,JOHN DRYDEN.,"222 And now no longer letted[49] of his prey,"
3392,JOHN DRYDEN.,He leaps up at it with enraged desire:
3393,JOHN DRYDEN.,"O'erlooks the neighbours with a wide survey,"
3394,JOHN DRYDEN.,And nods at every house his threatening fire.
3395,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3396,JOHN DRYDEN.,"223 The ghosts of traitors from the bridge descend,"
3397,JOHN DRYDEN.,With bold fanatic spectres to rejoice:
3398,JOHN DRYDEN.,"About the fire into a dance they bend,"
3399,JOHN DRYDEN.,And sing their sabbath notes with feeble voice.
3400,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3401,JOHN DRYDEN.,224 Our guardian angel saw them where they sate
3402,JOHN DRYDEN.,Above the palace of our slumbering king:
3403,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He sigh'd, abandoning his charge to fate,"
3404,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, drooping, oft look'd back upon the wing."
3405,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3406,JOHN DRYDEN.,225 At length the crackling noise and dreadful blaze
3407,JOHN DRYDEN.,Call'd up some waking lover to the sight;
3408,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And long it was ere he the rest could raise,"
3409,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose heavy eyelids yet were full of night.
3410,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3411,JOHN DRYDEN.,"226 The next to danger, hot pursued by fate,"
3412,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Half-clothed, half-naked, hastily retire:"
3413,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And frighted mothers strike their breasts too late,"
3414,JOHN DRYDEN.,For helpless infants left amidst the fire.
3415,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3416,JOHN DRYDEN.,227 Their cries soon waken all the dwellers near;
3417,JOHN DRYDEN.,Now murmuring noises rise in every street:
3418,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The more remote run stumbling with their fear,"
3419,JOHN DRYDEN.,And in the dark men jostle as they meet.
3420,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3421,JOHN DRYDEN.,228 So weary bees in little cells repose;
3422,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But if night-robbers lift the well-stored hive,"
3423,JOHN DRYDEN.,"An humming through their waxen city grows,"
3424,JOHN DRYDEN.,And out upon each other's wings they drive.
3425,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3426,JOHN DRYDEN.,229 Now streets grow throng'd and busy as by day:
3427,JOHN DRYDEN.,Some run for buckets to the hallow'd quire:
3428,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Some cut the pipes, and some the engines play;"
3429,JOHN DRYDEN.,And some more bold mount ladders to the fire.
3430,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3431,JOHN DRYDEN.,230 In vain: for from the east a Belgian wind
3432,JOHN DRYDEN.,His hostile breath through the dry rafters sent;
3433,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The flames impell'd soon left their foes behind,"
3434,JOHN DRYDEN.,And forward with a wanton fury went.
3435,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3436,JOHN DRYDEN.,"231 A quay of fire ran all along the shore,"
3437,JOHN DRYDEN.,And lighten'd all the river with a blaze:
3438,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The waken'd tides began again to roar,"
3439,JOHN DRYDEN.,And wondering fish in shining waters gaze.
3440,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3441,JOHN DRYDEN.,"232 Old father Thames raised up his reverend head,"
3442,JOHN DRYDEN.,But fear'd the fate of Simois would return:
3443,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Deep in his ooze he sought his sedgy bed,"
3444,JOHN DRYDEN.,And shrunk his waters back into his urn.
3445,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3446,JOHN DRYDEN.,"233 The fire, meantime, walks in a broader gross;"
3447,JOHN DRYDEN.,To either hand his wings he opens wide:
3448,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He wades the streets, and straight he reaches cross,"
3449,JOHN DRYDEN.,And plays his longing flames on the other side.
3450,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3451,JOHN DRYDEN.,"234 At first they warm, then scorch, and then they take;"
3452,JOHN DRYDEN.,Now with long necks from side to side they feed:
3453,JOHN DRYDEN.,"At length, grown strong, their mother-fire forsake,"
3454,JOHN DRYDEN.,And a new colony of flames succeed.
3455,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3456,JOHN DRYDEN.,235 To every nobler portion of the town
3457,JOHN DRYDEN.,The curling billows roll their restless tide:
3458,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In parties now they straggle up and down,"
3459,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As armies, unopposed, for prey divide."
3460,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3461,JOHN DRYDEN.,"236 One mighty squadron with a side-wind sped,"
3462,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Through narrow lanes his cumber'd fire does haste,"
3463,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By powerful charms of gold and silver led,"
3464,JOHN DRYDEN.,The Lombard bankers and the 'Change to waste.
3465,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3466,JOHN DRYDEN.,"237 Another backward to the Tower would go,"
3467,JOHN DRYDEN.,And slowly eats his way against the wind:
3468,JOHN DRYDEN.,But the main body of the marching foe
3469,JOHN DRYDEN.,Against the imperial palace is design'd.
3470,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3471,JOHN DRYDEN.,"238 Now day appears, and with the day the King,"
3472,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose early care had robb'd him of his rest:
3473,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Far off the cracks of falling houses ring,"
3474,JOHN DRYDEN.,And shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast.
3475,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3476,JOHN DRYDEN.,"239 Near as he draws, thick harbingers of smoke"
3477,JOHN DRYDEN.,With gloomy pillars cover all the place;
3478,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose little intervals of night are broke
3479,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By sparks, that drive against his sacred face."
3480,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3481,JOHN DRYDEN.,"240 More than his guards, his sorrows made him known,"
3482,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And pious tears, which down his cheeks did shower;"
3483,JOHN DRYDEN.,The wretched in his grief forgot their own;
3484,JOHN DRYDEN.,So much the pity of a king has power.
3485,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3486,JOHN DRYDEN.,"241 He wept the flames of what he loved so well,"
3487,JOHN DRYDEN.,And what so well had merited his love:
3488,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For never prince in grace did more excel,"
3489,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or royal city more in duty strove.
3490,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3491,JOHN DRYDEN.,242 Nor with an idle care did he behold:
3492,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Subjects may grieve, but monarchs must redress;"
3493,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He cheers the fearful, and commends the bold,"
3494,JOHN DRYDEN.,And makes despairers hope for good success.
3495,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3496,JOHN DRYDEN.,"243 Himself directs what first is to be done,"
3497,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And orders all the succours which they bring,"
3498,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The helpful and the good about him run,"
3499,JOHN DRYDEN.,And form an army worthy such a king.
3500,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3501,JOHN DRYDEN.,"244 He sees the dire contagion spread so fast,"
3502,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That, where it seizes, all relief is vain:"
3503,JOHN DRYDEN.,And therefore must unwillingly lay waste
3504,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That country, which would else the foe maintain."
3505,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3506,JOHN DRYDEN.,245 The powder blows up all before the fire:
3507,JOHN DRYDEN.,The amazèd flames stand gather'd on a heap;
3508,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And from the precipice's brink retire,"
3509,JOHN DRYDEN.,Afraid to venture on so large a leap.
3510,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3511,JOHN DRYDEN.,"246 Thus fighting fires a while themselves consume,"
3512,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But straight, like Turks forced on to win or die,"
3513,JOHN DRYDEN.,"They first lay tender bridges of their fume,"
3514,JOHN DRYDEN.,And o'er the breach in unctuous vapours fly.
3515,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3516,JOHN DRYDEN.,"247 Part stay for passage, till a gust of wind"
3517,JOHN DRYDEN.,Ships o'er their forces in a shining sheet:
3518,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Part creeping under ground their journey blind,"
3519,JOHN DRYDEN.,And climbing from below their fellows meet.
3520,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3521,JOHN DRYDEN.,"248 Thus to some desert plain, or old woodside,"
3522,JOHN DRYDEN.,Dire night-hags come from far to dance their round;
3523,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And o'er broad rivers on their fiends they ride,"
3524,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or sweep in clouds above the blasted ground.
3525,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3526,JOHN DRYDEN.,"249 No help avails: for hydra-like, the fire"
3527,JOHN DRYDEN.,Lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way;
3528,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And scarce the wealthy can one half retire,"
3529,JOHN DRYDEN.,Before he rushes in to share the prey.
3530,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3531,JOHN DRYDEN.,"250 The rich grow suppliant, and the poor grow proud;"
3532,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Those offer mighty gain, and these ask more:"
3533,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So void of pity is the ignoble crowd,"
3534,JOHN DRYDEN.,When others' ruin may increase their store.
3535,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3536,JOHN DRYDEN.,251 As those who live by shores with joy behold
3537,JOHN DRYDEN.,Some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh;
3538,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And from the rocks leap down for shipwreck'd gold,"
3539,JOHN DRYDEN.,And seek the tempests which the others fly:
3540,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3541,JOHN DRYDEN.,"252 So these but wait the owners' last despair,"
3542,JOHN DRYDEN.,And what's permitted to the flames invade;
3543,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Even from their jaws they hungry morsels tear,"
3544,JOHN DRYDEN.,And on their backs the spoils of Vulcan lade.
3545,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3546,JOHN DRYDEN.,253 The days were all in this lost labour spent;
3547,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And when the weary king gave place to night,"
3548,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His beams he to his royal brother lent,"
3549,JOHN DRYDEN.,And so shone still in his reflective light.
3550,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3551,JOHN DRYDEN.,"254 Night came, but without darkness or repose,--"
3552,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A dismal picture of the general doom,"
3553,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where souls, distracted when the trumpet blows,"
3554,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And half unready, with their bodies come."
3555,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3556,JOHN DRYDEN.,"255 Those who have homes, when home they do repair,"
3557,JOHN DRYDEN.,To a last lodging call their wandering friends:
3558,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their short uneasy sleeps are broke with care,"
3559,JOHN DRYDEN.,To look how near their own destruction tends.
3560,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3561,JOHN DRYDEN.,"256 Those who have none, sit round where once it was,"
3562,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with full eyes each wonted room require;
3563,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Haunting the yet warm ashes of the place,"
3564,JOHN DRYDEN.,As murder'd men walk where they did expire.
3565,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3566,JOHN DRYDEN.,"257 Some stir up coals, and watch the vestal fire,"
3567,JOHN DRYDEN.,Others in vain from sight of ruin run;
3568,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, while through burning labyrinths they retire,"
3569,JOHN DRYDEN.,With loathing eyes repeat what they would shun.
3570,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3571,JOHN DRYDEN.,"258 The most in fields like herded beasts lie down,"
3572,JOHN DRYDEN.,To dews obnoxious on the grassy floor;
3573,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown,"
3574,JOHN DRYDEN.,Sad parents watch the remnants of their store.
3575,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3576,JOHN DRYDEN.,259 While by the motion of the flames they guess
3577,JOHN DRYDEN.,"What streets are burning now, and what are near;"
3578,JOHN DRYDEN.,"An infant waking to the paps would press,"
3579,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And meets, instead of milk, a falling tear."
3580,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3581,JOHN DRYDEN.,"260 No thought can ease them but their sovereign's care,"
3582,JOHN DRYDEN.,Whose praise the afflicted as their comfort sing:
3583,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Even those whom want might drive to just despair,"
3584,JOHN DRYDEN.,Think life a blessing under such a king.
3585,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3586,JOHN DRYDEN.,"261 Meantime he sadly suffers in their grief,"
3587,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Out-weeps an hermit, and out-prays a saint:"
3588,JOHN DRYDEN.,"All the long night he studies their relief,"
3589,JOHN DRYDEN.,"How they may be supplied, and he may want."
3590,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3591,JOHN DRYDEN.,"262 O God, said he, thou patron of my days,"
3592,JOHN DRYDEN.,Guide of my youth in exile and distress!
3593,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who me, unfriended, brought'st by wondrous ways,"
3594,JOHN DRYDEN.,The kingdom of my fathers to possess:
3595,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3596,JOHN DRYDEN.,"263 Be thou my judge, with what unwearied care"
3597,JOHN DRYDEN.,I since have labour'd for my people's good;
3598,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To bind the bruises of a civil war,"
3599,JOHN DRYDEN.,And stop the issues of their wasting blood.
3600,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3601,JOHN DRYDEN.,"264 Thou who hast taught me to forgive the ill,"
3602,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And recompense, as friends, the good misled;"
3603,JOHN DRYDEN.,"If mercy be a precept of thy will,"
3604,JOHN DRYDEN.,Return that mercy on thy servant's head.
3605,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3606,JOHN DRYDEN.,"265 Or if my heedless youth has stepp'd astray,"
3607,JOHN DRYDEN.,Too soon forgetful of thy gracious hand;
3608,JOHN DRYDEN.,"On me alone thy just displeasure lay,"
3609,JOHN DRYDEN.,But take thy judgments from this mourning land.
3610,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3611,JOHN DRYDEN.,"266 We all have sinn'd, and thou hast laid us low,"
3612,JOHN DRYDEN.,As humble earth from whence at first we came:
3613,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Like flying shades before the clouds we show,"
3614,JOHN DRYDEN.,And shrink like parchment in consuming flame.
3615,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3616,JOHN DRYDEN.,267 O let it be enough what thou hast done;
3617,JOHN DRYDEN.,"When spotted Deaths ran arm'd through every street,"
3618,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With poison'd darts which not the good could shun,"
3619,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The speedy could out-fly, or valiant meet."
3620,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3621,JOHN DRYDEN.,"268 The living few, and frequent funerals then,"
3622,JOHN DRYDEN.,Proclaim'd thy wrath on this forsaken place;
3623,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And now those few who are return'd again,"
3624,JOHN DRYDEN.,Thy searching judgments to their dwellings trace.
3625,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3626,JOHN DRYDEN.,"269 O pass not, Lord, an absolute decree,"
3627,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or bind thy sentence unconditional!
3628,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But in thy sentence our remorse foresee,"
3629,JOHN DRYDEN.,And in that foresight this thy doom recall.
3630,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3631,JOHN DRYDEN.,"270 Thy threatenings, Lord, as thine thou mayst revoke:"
3632,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But if immutable and fix'd they stand,"
3633,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Continue still thyself to give the stroke,"
3634,JOHN DRYDEN.,And let not foreign foes oppress thy land.
3635,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3636,JOHN DRYDEN.,"271 The Eternal heard, and from the heavenly quire"
3637,JOHN DRYDEN.,Chose out the cherub with the flaming sword;
3638,JOHN DRYDEN.,And bade him swiftly drive the approaching fire
3639,JOHN DRYDEN.,From where our naval magazines were stored.
3640,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3641,JOHN DRYDEN.,"272 The blessed minister his wings display'd,"
3642,JOHN DRYDEN.,And like a shooting star he cleft the night:
3643,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He charged the flames, and those that disobey'd"
3644,JOHN DRYDEN.,He lash'd to duty with his sword of light.
3645,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3646,JOHN DRYDEN.,273 The fugitive flames chastised went forth to prey
3647,JOHN DRYDEN.,"On pious structures, by our fathers rear'd;"
3648,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By which to heaven they did affect the way,"
3649,JOHN DRYDEN.,Ere faith in churchmen without works was heard.
3650,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3651,JOHN DRYDEN.,"274 The wanting orphans saw, with watery eyes,"
3652,JOHN DRYDEN.,Their founder's charity in dust laid low;
3653,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And sent to God their ever-answered cries,"
3654,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For He protects the poor, who made them so."
3655,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3656,JOHN DRYDEN.,"275 Nor could thy fabric, Paul's, defend thee long,"
3657,JOHN DRYDEN.,Though thou wert sacred to thy Maker's praise:
3658,JOHN DRYDEN.,Though made immortal by a poet's song;
3659,JOHN DRYDEN.,And poets' songs the Theban walls could raise.
3660,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3661,JOHN DRYDEN.,"276 The daring flames peep'd in, and saw from far"
3662,JOHN DRYDEN.,The awful beauties of the sacred quire:
3663,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But since it was profaned by civil war,"
3664,JOHN DRYDEN.,Heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire.
3665,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3666,JOHN DRYDEN.,"277 Now down the narrow streets it swiftly came,"
3667,JOHN DRYDEN.,And widely opening did on both sides prey:
3668,JOHN DRYDEN.,"This benefit we sadly owe the flame,"
3669,JOHN DRYDEN.,If only ruin must enlarge our way.
3670,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3671,JOHN DRYDEN.,278 And now four days the sun had seen our woes:
3672,JOHN DRYDEN.,Four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire:
3673,JOHN DRYDEN.,"It seem'd as if the stars more sickly rose,"
3674,JOHN DRYDEN.,And farther from the feverish north retire.
3675,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3676,JOHN DRYDEN.,"279 In th' empyrean heaven, the bless'd abode,"
3677,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The Thrones and the Dominions prostrate lie,"
3678,JOHN DRYDEN.,Not daring to behold their angry God;
3679,JOHN DRYDEN.,And a hush'd silence damps the tuneful sky.
3680,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3681,JOHN DRYDEN.,"280 At length the Almighty cast a pitying eye,"
3682,JOHN DRYDEN.,And mercy softly touch'd his melting breast:
3683,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He saw the town's one half in rubbish lie,"
3684,JOHN DRYDEN.,And eager flames drive on to storm the rest.
3685,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3686,JOHN DRYDEN.,"281 An hollow crystal pyramid he takes,"
3687,JOHN DRYDEN.,In firmamental waters dipt above;
3688,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Of it a broad extinguisher he makes,"
3689,JOHN DRYDEN.,And hoods the flames that to their quarry drove.
3690,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3691,JOHN DRYDEN.,"282 The vanquish'd fires withdraw from every place,"
3692,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or, full with feeding, sink into a sleep:"
3693,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Each household genius shows again his face,"
3694,JOHN DRYDEN.,And from the hearths the little Lares creep.
3695,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3696,JOHN DRYDEN.,283 Our King this more than natural change beholds;
3697,JOHN DRYDEN.,With sober joy his heart and eyes abound:
3698,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To the All-good his lifted hands he folds,"
3699,JOHN DRYDEN.,And thanks him low on his redeemed ground.
3700,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3701,JOHN DRYDEN.,"284 As when sharp frosts had long constrain'd the earth,"
3702,JOHN DRYDEN.,A kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain;
3703,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And first the tender blade peeps up to birth,"
3704,JOHN DRYDEN.,And straight the green fields laugh with promised grain:
3705,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3706,JOHN DRYDEN.,285 By such degrees the spreading gladness grew
3707,JOHN DRYDEN.,In every heart which fear had froze before:
3708,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The standing streets with so much joy they view,"
3709,JOHN DRYDEN.,That with less grief the perish'd they deplore.
3710,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3711,JOHN DRYDEN.,286 The father of the people open'd wide
3712,JOHN DRYDEN.,"His stores, and all the poor with plenty fed:"
3713,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus God's anointed God's own place supplied,"
3714,JOHN DRYDEN.,And fill'd the empty with his daily bread.
3715,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3716,JOHN DRYDEN.,"287 This royal bounty brought its own reward,"
3717,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And in their minds so deep did print the sense,"
3718,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That if their ruins sadly they regard,"
3719,JOHN DRYDEN.,'Tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence.
3720,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3721,JOHN DRYDEN.,"288 But so may he live long, that town to sway,"
3722,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Which by his auspice they will nobler make,"
3723,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As he will hatch their ashes by his stay,"
3724,JOHN DRYDEN.,And not their humble ruins now forsake.
3725,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3726,JOHN DRYDEN.,289 They have not lost their loyalty by fire;
3727,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Nor is their courage or their wealth so low,"
3728,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That from his wars they poorly would retire,"
3729,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or beg the pity of a vanquish'd foe.
3730,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3731,JOHN DRYDEN.,"290 Not with more constancy the Jews of old,"
3732,JOHN DRYDEN.,"By Cyrus from rewarded exile sent,"
3733,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Their royal city did in dust behold,"
3734,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or with more vigour to rebuild it went.
3735,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3736,JOHN DRYDEN.,"291 The utmost malice of their stars is past,"
3737,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And two dire comets, which have scourged the town,"
3738,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In their own plague and fire have breathed the last,"
3739,JOHN DRYDEN.,Or dimly in their sinking sockets frown.
3740,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3741,JOHN DRYDEN.,"292 Now frequent trines the happier lights among,"
3742,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And high-raised Jove, from his dark prison freed,"
3743,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Those weights took off that on his planet hung,"
3744,JOHN DRYDEN.,Will gloriously the new-laid work succeed.
3745,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3746,JOHN DRYDEN.,"293 Methinks already from this chemic flame,"
3747,JOHN DRYDEN.,I see a city of more precious mould:
3748,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rich as the town which gives the Indies name,"
3749,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With silver paved, and all divine with gold."
3750,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3751,JOHN DRYDEN.,"294 Already labouring with a mighty fate,"
3752,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow,"
3753,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And seems to have renew'd her charter's date,"
3754,JOHN DRYDEN.,Which Heaven will to the death of time allow.
3755,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3756,JOHN DRYDEN.,"295 More great than human now, and more august,"
3757,JOHN DRYDEN.,Now deified she from her fires does rise:
3758,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Her widening streets on new foundations trust,"
3759,JOHN DRYDEN.,And opening into larger parts she flies.
3760,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3761,JOHN DRYDEN.,"296 Before, she like some shepherdess did show,"
3762,JOHN DRYDEN.,Who sat to bathe her by a river's side;
3763,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Not answering to her fame, but rude and low,"
3764,JOHN DRYDEN.,Nor taught the beauteous arts of modern pride.
3765,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3766,JOHN DRYDEN.,"297 Now, like a maiden queen, she will behold,"
3767,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From her high turrets, hourly suitors come;"
3768,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The East with incense, and the West with gold,"
3769,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Will stand, like suppliants, to receive her doom!"
3770,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3771,JOHN DRYDEN.,"298 The silver Thames, her own domestic flood,"
3772,JOHN DRYDEN.,Shall bear her vessels like a sweeping train;
3773,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And often wind, as of his mistress proud,"
3774,JOHN DRYDEN.,With longing eyes to meet her face again.
3775,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3776,JOHN DRYDEN.,"299 The wealthy Tagus, and the wealthier Rhine,"
3777,JOHN DRYDEN.,The glory of their towns no more shall boast;
3778,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And Seine, that would with Belgian rivers join,"
3779,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shall find her lustre stain'd, and traffic lost."
3780,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3781,JOHN DRYDEN.,"300 The venturous merchant who design'd more far,"
3782,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And touches on our hospitable shore,"
3783,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Charm'd with the splendour of this northern star,"
3784,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shall here unlade him, and depart no more."
3785,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3786,JOHN DRYDEN.,"301 Our powerful navy shall no longer meet,"
3787,JOHN DRYDEN.,The wealth of France or Holland to invade;
3788,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The beauty of this town without a fleet,"
3789,JOHN DRYDEN.,From all the world shall vindicate her trade.
3790,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3791,JOHN DRYDEN.,"302 And while this famed emporium we prepare,"
3792,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The British ocean shall such triumphs boast,"
3793,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That those, who now disdain our trade to share,"
3794,JOHN DRYDEN.,Shall rob like pirates on our wealthy coast.
3795,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3796,JOHN DRYDEN.,"303 Already we have conquer'd half the war,"
3797,JOHN DRYDEN.,And the less dangerous part is left behind:
3798,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Our trouble now is but to make them dare,"
3799,JOHN DRYDEN.,And not so great to vanquish as to find.
3800,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3801,JOHN DRYDEN.,"304 Thus to the Eastern wealth through storms we go,"
3802,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But now, the Cape once doubled, fear no more;"
3803,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A constant trade-wind will securely blow,"
3804,JOHN DRYDEN.,And gently lay us on the spicy shore.

4204,TO THE READER.,TO THE READER.
4205,TO THE READER.,
4206,TO THE READER.,It is not my intention to make an apology for my poem: some will think
4207,TO THE READER.,"it needs no excuse, and others will receive none. The design I am sure"
4208,TO THE READER.,"is honest: but he who draws his pen for one party, must expect to make"
4209,TO THE READER.,enemies of the other. For wit and fool are consequence of Whig and Tory;
4210,TO THE READER.,and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary side. There is a
4211,TO THE READER.,"treasury of merits in the Fanatic church, as well as in the Popish; and"
4212,TO THE READER.,"a pennyworth to be had of saintship, honesty, and poetry, for the lewd,"
4213,TO THE READER.,"the factious, and the blockheads: but the longest chapter in Deuteronomy"
4214,TO THE READER.,"has not curses enough for an Anti-Bromingham. My comfort is, their"
4215,TO THE READER.,manifest prejudice to my cause will render their judgment of less
4216,TO THE READER.,"authority against me. Yet if a poem have genius, it will force its own"
4217,TO THE READER.,"reception in the world. For there is a sweetness in good verse, which"
4218,TO THE READER.,tickles even while it hurts; and no man can be heartily angry with him
4219,TO THE READER.,who pleases him against his will. The commendation  of adversaries is
4220,TO THE READER.,"the greatest triumph of a writer, because it never comes unless"
4221,TO THE READER.,extorted. But I can be satisfied on more easy terms: if I happen to
4222,TO THE READER.,"please the more moderate sort, I shall be sure of an honest party, and,"
4223,TO THE READER.,"in all probability, of the best judges; for the least concerned are"
4224,TO THE READER.,"commonly the least corrupt. And I confess I have laid in for those, by"
4225,TO THE READER.,"rebating the satire (where justice would allow it), from carrying too"
4226,TO THE READER.,sharp an edge. They who can criticise so weakly as to imagine I have
4227,TO THE READER.,"done my worst, may be convinced, at their own cost, that I can write"
4228,TO THE READER.,"severely, with more ease than I can gently. I have but laughed at some"
4229,TO THE READER.,"men's follies, when I could have declaimed against their vices; and"
4230,TO THE READER.,"other men's virtues I have commended, as freely as I have taxed their"
4231,TO THE READER.,"crimes. And now, if you are a malicious reader, I expect you should"
4232,TO THE READER.,return upon me that I affect to be thought more impartial than I am. But
4233,TO THE READER.,"if men are not to be judged by their professions, God forgive you"
4234,TO THE READER.,Commonwealth's-men for professing so plausibly for the government. You
4235,TO THE READER.,cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing my name;
4236,TO THE READER.,"for that would reflect too grossly upon your own party, who never dare,"
4237,TO THE READER.,though they have the advantage of a jury to secure them. If you like not
4238,TO THE READER.,"my poem, the fault may possibly be in my writing (though it is hard for"
4239,TO THE READER.,an author to judge against himself); but more probably it is in your
4240,TO THE READER.,"morals, which cannot bear the truth of it. The violent on both sides"
4241,TO THE READER.,"will condemn the character of Absalom, as either too favourably or too"
4242,TO THE READER.,hardly drawn. But they are not the violent whom I desire to please. The
4243,TO THE READER.,"fault on the right hand is to extenuate, palliate, and indulge; and to"
4244,TO THE READER.,"confess freely, I have endeavoured to commit it. Besides the respect"
4245,TO THE READER.,"which I owe his birth, I have a greater for his heroic virtues; and"
4246,TO THE READER.,"David himself could not be more tender of the young man's life, than I"
4247,TO THE READER.,would be of his reputation. But since the most excellent natures are
4248,TO THE READER.,"always the most easy, and, as being such, are the soonest perverted by"
4249,TO THE READER.,"ill counsels, especially when baited with fame and glory; it is no more"
4250,TO THE READER.,"a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of Achitophel, than it"
4251,TO THE READER.,"was for Adam not to have resisted the two devils, the serpent and the"
4252,TO THE READER.,"woman. The conclusion of the story I purposely forbore to prosecute,"
4253,TO THE READER.,because I could not obtain from myself to show Absalom unfortunate. The
4254,TO THE READER.,frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waist; and if the
4255,TO THE READER.,"draught be so far true, it is as much as I designed."
4256,TO THE READER.,
4257,TO THE READER.,"Were I the inventor, who am only the historian, I should certainly"
4258,TO THE READER.,conclude the piece with the reconcilement of Absalom to David. And who
4259,TO THE READER.,knows but this may come to pass? Things were not brought to an extremity
4260,TO THE READER.,where I left the story: there seems yet to be room left for a composure;
4261,TO THE READER.,hereafter there may be only for pity. I have not so much as an
4262,TO THE READER.,"uncharitable wish against Achitophel, but am content to be accused of a"
4263,TO THE READER.,"good-natured error, and to hope with Origen, that the devil himself may"
4264,TO THE READER.,"at last be saved. For which reason, in this poem, he is neither brought"
4265,TO THE READER.,"to set his house in order, nor to dispose of his person afterwards as he"
4266,TO THE READER.,in wisdom shall think fit. God is infinitely merciful; and his
4267,TO THE READER.,"vicegerent is only not so, because he is not infinite."
4268,TO THE READER.,
4269,TO THE READER.,The true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction. And he
4270,TO THE READER.,"who writes honestly is no more an enemy to the offender, than the"
4271,TO THE READER.,"physician to the patient, when he prescribes harsh remedies to an"
4272,TO THE READER.,inveterate disease; for those are only in order to prevent the
4273,TO THE READER.,"chirurgeon's work of an _Ense rescindendum_, which I wish not to my very"
4274,TO THE READER.,enemies. To conclude all; if the body politic have any analogy to the
4275,TO THE READER.,"natural, in my weak judgment, an act of oblivion were as necessary in a"
4276,TO THE READER.,"hot distempered state, as an opiate would be in a raging fever."

4384,PART I.,The rightful cause at length became the wrong;
4385,PART I.,"And every loss the men of Jebus bore,                               90"
4386,PART I.,They still were thought God's enemies the more.
4387,PART I.,"Thus worn or weaken'd, well or ill content,"
4388,PART I.,Submit they must to David's government:
4389,PART I.,"Impoverish'd and deprived of all command,"
4390,PART I.,Their taxes doubled as they lost their land;
4391,PART I.,"And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,"
4392,PART I.,"Their gods disgraced, and burnt like common wood."
4393,PART I.,This set the heathen priesthood in a flame;
4394,PART I.,For priests of all religions are the same.
4395,PART I.,"Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,                            100"
4396,PART I.,"Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,"
4397,PART I.,"In his defence his servants are as bold,"
4398,PART I.,As if he had been born of beaten gold.
4399,PART I.,"The Jewish rabbins, though their enemies,"
4400,PART I.,In this conclude them honest men and wise:
4401,PART I.,"For 'twas their duty, all the learned think,"
4402,PART I.,To espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink.
4403,PART I.,"From hence began that Plot, the nation's curse,"
4404,PART I.,"Bad in itself, but represented worse;"
4405,PART I.,"Raised in extremes, and in extremes decried:                       110"
4406,PART I.,"With oaths affirm'd, with dying vows denied;"
4407,PART I.,Not weigh'd nor winnow'd by the multitude;
4408,PART I.,"But swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude."
4409,PART I.,"Some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies,"
4410,PART I.,"To please the fools, and puzzle all the wise."
4411,PART I.,"Succeeding times did equal folly call,"
4412,PART I.,"Believing nothing, or believing all."
4413,PART I.,"The Egyptian rites the Jebusites embraced,"
4414,PART I.,Where gods were recommended by their taste.
4415,PART I.,"Such savoury deities must needs be good,                           120"
4416,PART I.,As served at once for worship and for food.
4417,PART I.,By force they could not introduce these gods;
4418,PART I.,For ten to one in former days was odds.
4419,PART I.,"So fraud was used, the sacrificer's trade:"
4420,PART I.,Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.
4421,PART I.,"Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews,"
4422,PART I.,And raked for converts even the court and stews:
4423,PART I.,"Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took,"
4424,PART I.,"Because the fleece accompanies the flock,"
4425,PART I.,Some thought they God's anointed meant to slay                     130
4426,PART I.,"By guns, invented since full many a day:"
4427,PART I.,Our author swears it not; but who can know
4428,PART I.,How far the devil and Jebusites may go?
4429,PART I.,"This Plot, which fail'd for want of common sense,"
4430,PART I.,Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence:
4431,PART I.,"For as, when raging fevers boil the blood,"
4432,PART I.,"The standing lake soon floats into a flood,"
4433,PART I.,"And every hostile humour, which before"
4434,PART I.,"Slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er;"
4435,PART I.,"So several factions from this first ferment,                       140"
4436,PART I.,"Work up to foam, and threat the government."
4437,PART I.,"Some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise,"
4438,PART I.,Opposed the power to which they could not rise.
4439,PART I.,"Some had in courts been great, and, thrown from thence,"
4440,PART I.,Like fiends were harden'd in impenitence.
4441,PART I.,"Some, by their monarch's fatal mercy, grown,"
4442,PART I.,"From pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne,"
4443,PART I.,Were raised in power and public office high;
4444,PART I.,"Strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie."
4445,PART I.,
4446,PART I.,"Of these, the false Achitophel was first;                        150"
4447,PART I.,A name to all succeeding ages cursed:
4448,PART I.,"For close designs, and crooked counsels fit;"
4449,PART I.,"Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit;"
4450,PART I.,"Restless, unfix'd in principles and place;"
4451,PART I.,"In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace:"
4452,PART I.,"A fiery soul, which, working out its way,"
4453,PART I.,"Fretted the pigmy body to decay,"
4454,PART I.,And o'er-inform'd the tenement of clay.
4455,PART I.,A daring pilot in extremity;
4456,PART I.,"Pleased with the danger, when the waves went high,                 160"
4457,PART I.,"He sought the storms; but for a calm unfit,"
4458,PART I.,"Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit."
4459,PART I.,"Great wits are sure to madness near allied,"
4460,PART I.,And thin partitions do their bounds divide;
4461,PART I.,"Else why should he, with wealth and honour blest,"
4462,PART I.,Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?
4463,PART I.,Punish a body which he could not please;
4464,PART I.,"Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?"
4465,PART I.,"And all to leave what with his toil he won,"
4466,PART I.,"To that unfeather'd two-legg'd thing, a son;                       170"
4467,PART I.,"Got, while his soul did huddled notions try;"
4468,PART I.,"And born a shapeless lump, like anarchy."
4469,PART I.,"In friendship false, implacable in hate;"
4470,PART I.,"Resolved to ruin, or to rule the state."
4471,PART I.,"To compass this, the triple bond[69] he broke;"
4472,PART I.,The pillars of the public safety shook;
4473,PART I.,And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke:
4474,PART I.,"Then seized with fear, yet still affecting fame,"
4475,PART I.,Usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name.
4476,PART I.,"So easy still it proves, in factious times,                        180"
4477,PART I.,With public zeal to cancel private crimes!
4478,PART I.,"How safe is treason, and how sacred ill,"
4479,PART I.,Where none can sin against the people's will!
4480,PART I.,"Where crowds can wink, and no offence be known,"
4481,PART I.,Since in another's guilt they find their own!
4482,PART I.,Yet fame deserved no enemy can grudge;
4483,PART I.,"The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge."
4484,PART I.,In Israel's courts ne'er sat an Abethdin
4485,PART I.,"With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean,"
4486,PART I.,"Unbribed, unsought, the wretched to redress;                       190"
4487,PART I.,"Swift of despatch, and easy of access."
4488,PART I.,"Oh! had he been content to serve the crown,"
4489,PART I.,With virtues only proper to the gown;
4490,PART I.,Or had the rankness of the soil been freed
4491,PART I.,"From cockle, that oppress'd the noble seed;"
4492,PART I.,"David for him his tuneful harp had strung,"
4493,PART I.,And Heaven had wanted one immortal song.
4494,PART I.,"But wild ambition loves to slide, not stand,"
4495,PART I.,And fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land.
4496,PART I.,"Achitophel, grown weary to possess                                 200"
4497,PART I.,"A lawful fame, and lazy happiness,"
4498,PART I.,"Disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free,"
4499,PART I.,And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree.
4500,PART I.,"Now, manifest of crimes contrived long since,"
4501,PART I.,He stood at bold defiance with his prince;
4502,PART I.,Held up the buckler of the people's cause
4503,PART I.,"Against the crown, and skulk'd behind the laws."
4504,PART I.,The wish'd occasion of the plot he takes;
4505,PART I.,"Some circumstances finds, but more he makes;"
4506,PART I.,By buzzing emissaries fills the ears                               210
4507,PART I.,Of listening crowds with jealousies and fears
4508,PART I.,"Of arbitrary counsels brought to light,"
4509,PART I.,And proves the king himself a Jebusite.
4510,PART I.,Weak arguments! which yet he knew full well
4511,PART I.,Were strong with people easy to rebel.
4512,PART I.,"For, govern'd by the moon, the giddy Jews"
4513,PART I.,"Tread the same track, when she the prime renews;"
4514,PART I.,"And once in twenty years, their scribes record,"
4515,PART I.,By natural instinct they change their lord.
4516,PART I.,"Achitophel still wants a chief, and none                           220"
4517,PART I.,Was found so fit as warlike Absalom.
4518,PART I.,"Not that he wish'd his greatness to create,"
4519,PART I.,For politicians neither love nor hate:
4520,PART I.,"But, for he knew his title not allow'd,"
4521,PART I.,Would keep him still depending on the crowd:
4522,PART I.,"That kingly power, thus ebbing out, might be"
4523,PART I.,Drawn to the dregs of a democracy.
4524,PART I.,"Him he attempts with studied arts to please,"
4525,PART I.,And sheds his venom in such words as these:
4526,PART I.,
4527,PART I.,Auspicious prince! at whose nativity                             230
4528,PART I.,Some royal planet ruled the southern sky;
4529,PART I.,Thy longing country's darling and desire;
4530,PART I.,Their cloudy pillar and their guardian fire:
4531,PART I.,"Their second Moses, whose extended wand"
4532,PART I.,"Divides the seas, and shows the promised land:"
4533,PART I.,"Whose dawning day, in every distant age,"
4534,PART I.,Has exercised the sacred prophet's rage:
4535,PART I.,"The people's prayer, the glad diviner's theme,"
4536,PART I.,"The young men's vision, and the old men's dream!"
4537,PART I.,"Thee, Saviour, thee the nation's vows confess,                     240"
4538,PART I.,"And, never satisfied with seeing, bless:"
4539,PART I.,"Swift, unbespoken pomps thy steps proclaim,"
4540,PART I.,And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name.
4541,PART I.,"How long wilt thou the general joy detain,"
4542,PART I.,Starve and defraud the people of thy reign!
4543,PART I.,"Content ingloriously to pass thy days,"
4544,PART I.,Like one of virtue's fools that feed on praise;
4545,PART I.,"Till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright,"
4546,PART I.,"Grow stale, and tarnish with our daily sight?"
4547,PART I.,"Believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be                         250"
4548,PART I.,"Or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree."
4549,PART I.,"Heaven has to all allotted, soon or late,"
4550,PART I.,Some lucky revolution of their fate:
4551,PART I.,"Whose motions, if we watch and guide with skill,"
4552,PART I.,"(For human good depends on human will,)"
4553,PART I.,"Our fortune rolls as from a smooth descent,"
4554,PART I.,And from the first impression takes the bent:
4555,PART I.,"But if, unseized, she glides away like wind,"
4556,PART I.,And leaves repenting folly far behind.
4557,PART I.,"Now, now she meets you with a glorious prize,                      260"
4558,PART I.,And spreads her locks before her as she flies.
4559,PART I.,"Had thus old David, from whose loins you spring,"
4560,PART I.,"Not dared when fortune called him to be king,"
4561,PART I.,"At Gath an exile he might still remain,"
4562,PART I.,And Heaven's anointing oil had been in vain.
4563,PART I.,Let his successful youth your hopes engage;
4564,PART I.,But shun the example of declining age:
4565,PART I.,"Behold him setting in his western skies,"
4566,PART I.,The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise.
4567,PART I.,"He is not now, as when on Jordan's sand                            270"
4568,PART I.,"The joyful people throng'd to see him land,"
4569,PART I.,Covering the beach and blackening all the strand;
4570,PART I.,"But, like the prince of angels, from his height"
4571,PART I.,Comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light:
4572,PART I.,Betray'd by one poor Plot to public scorn:
4573,PART I.,(Our only blessing since his cursed return:)
4574,PART I.,"Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind,"
4575,PART I.,Blown off and scatter'd by a puff of wind.
4576,PART I.,"What strength can he to your designs oppose,"
4577,PART I.,"Naked of friends, and round beset with foes?                       280"
4578,PART I.,"If Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use,"
4579,PART I.,A foreign aid would more incense the Jews:
4580,PART I.,Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring;
4581,PART I.,"Foment the war, but not support the king:"
4582,PART I.,Nor would the royal party e'er unite
4583,PART I.,With Pharaoh's arms to assist the Jebusite;
4584,PART I.,"Or if they should, their interest soon would break,"
4585,PART I.,And with such odious aid make David weak.
4586,PART I.,"All sorts of men, by my successful arts,"
4587,PART I.,"Abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts                     290"
4588,PART I.,From David's rule: and 'tis their general cry--

4590,PART I.,"If you, as champion of the public good,"
4591,PART I.,"Add to their arms a chief of royal blood,"
4592,PART I.,"What may not Israel hope, and what applause"
4593,PART I.,Might such a general gain by such a cause?
4594,PART I.,"Not barren praise alone--that gaudy flower,"
4595,PART I.,Fair only to the sight--but solid power:
4596,PART I.,"And nobler is a limited command,"
4597,PART I.,"Given by the love of all your native land,                         300"
4598,PART I.,"Than a successive title, long and dark,"
4599,PART I.,Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's ark.
4600,PART I.,
4601,PART I.,"What cannot praise effect in mighty minds,"
4602,PART I.,"When flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds?"
4603,PART I.,"Desire of power, on earth a vicious weed,"
4604,PART I.,"Yet sprung from high, is of celestial seed:"
4605,PART I.,"In God 'tis glory; and when men aspire,"
4606,PART I.,'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire.
4607,PART I.,"The ambitious youth, too covetous of fame,"
4608,PART I.,"Too full of angels' metal in his frame,                            310"
4609,PART I.,"Unwarily was led from virtue's ways,"
4610,PART I.,"Made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise."
4611,PART I.,"Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,"
4612,PART I.,"For royal blood within him struggled still,"
4613,PART I.,He thus replied:--And what pretence have I
4614,PART I.,To take up arms for public liberty?
4615,PART I.,"My father governs with unquestion'd right,"
4616,PART I.,"The faith's defender, and mankind's delight;"
4617,PART I.,"Good, gracious, just, observant of the laws;"

4619,PART I.,"Whom has he wrong'd, in all his peaceful reign?"
4620,PART I.,Who sues for justice to his throne in vain?
4621,PART I.,"What millions has he pardon'd of his foes,"
4622,PART I.,Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose!
4623,PART I.,"Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good;"
4624,PART I.,"Inclined to mercy, and averse from blood."
4625,PART I.,"If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,"
4626,PART I.,His crime is God's beloved attribute.
4627,PART I.,"What could he gain his people to betray,"
4628,PART I.,Or change his right for arbitrary sway?                            330
4629,PART I.,Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign
4630,PART I.,"His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train."
4631,PART I.,"If David's rule Jerusalem displease,"
4632,PART I.,The dog-star heats their brains to this disease.
4633,PART I.,"Why then should I, encouraging the bad,"
4634,PART I.,Turn rebel and run popularly mad?
4635,PART I.,"Were he a tyrant, who by lawless might"

4637,PART I.,Well might I mourn; but nature's holy bands
4638,PART I.,"Would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands:                      340"
4639,PART I.,The people might assert their liberty;
4640,PART I.,But what was right in them were crime in me.
4641,PART I.,"His favour leaves me nothing to require,"
4642,PART I.,"Prevents my wishes, and outruns desire."
4643,PART I.,What more can I expect while David lives?
4644,PART I.,All but his kingly diadem he gives:
4645,PART I.,"And that--But here he paused; then, sighing, said--"
4646,PART I.,Is justly destined for a worthier head.
4647,PART I.,"For when my father from his toils shall rest,"

4651,PART I.,"His brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite,"
4652,PART I.,"Yet dauntless, and secure of native right,"
4653,PART I.,Of every royal virtue stands possess'd;
4654,PART I.,Still dear to all the bravest and the best.
4655,PART I.,His courage foes--his friends his truth proclaim;
4656,PART I.,His loyalty the king--the world his fame.
4657,PART I.,His mercy even the offending crowd will find;
4658,PART I.,For sure he comes of a forgiving kind.                             360
4659,PART I.,"Why should I then repine at Heaven's decree,"
4660,PART I.,Which gives me no pretence to royalty?
4661,PART I.,"Yet, oh! that fate, propitiously inclined,"
4662,PART I.,"Had raised my birth, or had debased my mind;"
4663,PART I.,"To my large soul not all her treasure lent,"
4664,PART I.,And then betray'd it to a mean descent!
4665,PART I.,"I find, I find my mounting spirits bold,"
4666,PART I.,And David's part disdains my mother's mould.
4667,PART I.,Why am I scanted by a niggard birth?

4669,PART I.,"And, made for empire, whispers me within,"

4681,PART I.,Not that your father's mildness I contemn;
4682,PART I.,But manly force becomes the diadem.
4683,PART I.,'Tis true he grants the people all they crave;
4684,PART I.,And more perhaps than subjects ought to have:

4726,PART I.,Love but themselves in their posterity.
4727,PART I.,"Or let his kindness by the effects be tried,"
4728,PART I.,Or let him lay his vain pretence aside.
4729,PART I.,"God said, he loved your father; could he bring"
4730,PART I.,"A better proof, than to anoint him king?                           430"
4731,PART I.,"It surely show'd he loved the shepherd well,"
4732,PART I.,Who gave so fair a flock as Israel.
4733,PART I.,Would David have you thought his darling son?
4734,PART I.,What means he then to alienate the crown?
4735,PART I.,The name of godly he may blush to bear:
4736,PART I.,Is't after God's own heart to cheat his heir?
4737,PART I.,"He to his brother gives supreme command,"
4738,PART I.,To you a legacy of barren land;
4739,PART I.,"Perhaps the old harp, on which he thrums his lays,"
4740,PART I.,Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise.                         440
4741,PART I.,"Then the next heir, a prince severe and wise,"
4742,PART I.,Already looks on you with jealous eyes;
4743,PART I.,"Sees through the thin disguises of your arts,"
4744,PART I.,And marks your progress in the people's hearts;
4745,PART I.,Though now his mighty soul its grief contains:
4746,PART I.,He meditates revenge who least complains;
4747,PART I.,"And like a lion, slumbering in the way,"
4748,PART I.,"Or sleep dissembling, while he waits his prey,"
4749,PART I.,"His fearless foes within his distance draws,"
4750,PART I.,"Constrains his roaring, and contracts his paws;                    450"
4751,PART I.,"Till at the last his time for fury found,"
4752,PART I.,He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground;
4753,PART I.,"The prostrate vulgar passes o'er and spares,"
4754,PART I.,But with a lordly rage his hunters tears.
4755,PART I.,Your case no tame expedients will afford:
4756,PART I.,"Resolve on death, or conquest by the sword,"
4757,PART I.,Which for no less a stake than life you draw;
4758,PART I.,And self-defence is nature's eldest law.
4759,PART I.,Leave the warm people no considering time:
4760,PART I.,For then rebellion may be thought a crime.                         460
4761,PART I.,"Avail yourself of what occasion gives,"
4762,PART I.,But try your title while your father lives:
4763,PART I.,"And that your arms may have a fair pretence,"
4764,PART I.,Proclaim you take them in the king's defence;
4765,PART I.,Whose sacred life each minute would expose
4766,PART I.,"To plots, from seeming friends, and secret foes."
4767,PART I.,And who can sound the depth of David's soul?
4768,PART I.,"Perhaps his fear, his kindness may control."
4769,PART I.,"He fears his brother, though he loves his son,"
4770,PART I.,For plighted vows too late to be undone.                           470
4771,PART I.,"If so, by force he wishes to be gain'd:"
4772,PART I.,By women's lechery to seem constrain'd.
4773,PART I.,"Doubt not; but, when he most affects the frown,"
4774,PART I.,Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown.
4775,PART I.,Secure his person to secure your cause:
4776,PART I.,They who possess the prince possess the laws.
4777,PART I.,
4778,PART I.,"He said, and this advice above the rest,"
4779,PART I.,With Absalom's mild nature suited best;
4780,PART I.,"Unblamed of life, ambition set aside,"
4781,PART I.,"Not stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride,                   480"
4782,PART I.,"How happy had he been, if destiny"
4783,PART I.,"Had higher placed his birth, or not so high!"
4784,PART I.,"His kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne,"
4785,PART I.,And bless'd all other countries but his own.
4786,PART I.,"But charming greatness since so few refuse,"
4787,PART I.,'Tis juster to lament him than accuse.
4788,PART I.,"Strong were his hopes a rival to remove,"
4789,PART I.,With blandishments to gain the public love:
4790,PART I.,"To head the faction while their zeal was hot,"
4791,PART I.,And popularly prosecute the Plot.                                  490
4792,PART I.,"To further this, Achitophel unites"
4793,PART I.,The malcontents of all the Israelites:
4794,PART I.,"Whose differing parties he could wisely join,"
4795,PART I.,For several ends to serve the same design.
4796,PART I.,The best--and of the princes some were such--
4797,PART I.,Who thought the power of monarchy too much;
4798,PART I.,"Mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts;"
4799,PART I.,"Not wicked, but seduced by impious arts."
4800,PART I.,"By these the springs of property were bent,"
4801,PART I.,"And wound so high, they crack'd the government.                    500"
4802,PART I.,"The next for interest sought to embroil the state,"
4803,PART I.,"To sell their duty at a dearer rate,"
4804,PART I.,And make their Jewish markets of the throne;
4805,PART I.,"Pretending public good, to serve their own."
4806,PART I.,"Others thought kings an useless heavy load,"
4807,PART I.,"Who cost too much, and did too little good."
4808,PART I.,"These were for laying honest David by,"
4809,PART I.,On principles of pure good husbandry.
4810,PART I.,"With them join'd all the haranguers of the throng,"
4811,PART I.,That thought to get preferment by the tongue.                      510
4812,PART I.,"Who follow next a double danger bring,"
4813,PART I.,"Not only hating David, but the king;"
4814,PART I.,The Solyimaean rout; well versed of old
4815,PART I.,"In godly faction, and in treason bold;"
4816,PART I.,"Cowering and quaking at a conqueror's sword,"
4817,PART I.,But lofty to a lawful prince restored;
4818,PART I.,"Saw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun,"
4819,PART I.,And scorn'd by Jebusites to be outdone.
4820,PART I.,Hot Levites headed these; who pull'd before
4821,PART I.,"From the ark, which in the Judges' days they bore,                 520"
4822,PART I.,"Resumed their cant, and with a zealous cry,"
4823,PART I.,Pursued their old beloved theocracy:
4824,PART I.,"Where Sanhedrim and priest enslaved the nation,"
4825,PART I.,And justified their spoils by inspiration:
4826,PART I.,"For who so fit to reign as Aaron's race,"
4827,PART I.,If once dominion they could found in grace?
4828,PART I.,"These led the pack; though not of surest scent,"
4829,PART I.,Yet deepest mouth'd against the government.
4830,PART I.,"A numerous host of dreaming saints succeed,"
4831,PART I.,Of the true old enthusiastic breed:                                530
4832,PART I.,"'Gainst form and order they their power employ,"
4833,PART I.,"Nothing to build, and all things to destroy."
4834,PART I.,"But far more numerous was the herd of such,"
4835,PART I.,"Who think too little, and who talk too much."
4836,PART I.,"These out of mere instinct, they knew not why,"
4837,PART I.,Adored their fathers' God and property;
4838,PART I.,"And by the same blind benefit of fate,"
4839,PART I.,The Devil and the Jebusite did hate:
4840,PART I.,"Born to be saved, even in their own despite,"
4841,PART I.,Because they could not help believing right.                       540
4842,PART I.,
4843,PART I.,Such were the tools: but a whole Hydra more
4844,PART I.,Remains of sprouting heads too long to score.
4845,PART I.,Some of their chiefs were princes of the land:
4846,PART I.,In the first rank of these did Zimri stand;
4847,PART I.,"A man so various, that he seem'd to be"
4848,PART I.,"Not one, but all mankind's epitome:"
4849,PART I.,"Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;"
4850,PART I.,"Was everything by starts, and nothing long;"
4851,PART I.,"But, in the course of one revolving moon,"
4852,PART I.,"Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:                      550"
4853,PART I.,"Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,"
4854,PART I.,Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.
4855,PART I.,"Blest madman, who could every hour employ,"
4856,PART I.,"With something new to wish, or to enjoy!"
4857,PART I.,Railing and praising were his usual themes;
4858,PART I.,"And both, to show his judgment, in extremes:"
4859,PART I.,"So over violent, or over civil,"
4860,PART I.,That every man with him was God or Devil.
4861,PART I.,In squandering wealth was his peculiar art:
4862,PART I.,Nothing went unrewarded but desert.                                560
4863,PART I.,"Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late;"
4864,PART I.,"He had his jest, and they had his estate."
4865,PART I.,He laugh'd himself from court; then sought relief
4866,PART I.,"By forming parties, but could ne'er be chief:"
4867,PART I.,"For, spite of him the weight of business fell"
4868,PART I.,On Absalom and wise Achitophel:
4869,PART I.,"Thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft,"
4870,PART I.,"He left not faction, but of that was left."
4871,PART I.,
4872,PART I.,Titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse
4873,PART I.,"Of lords, below the dignity of verse.                              570"
4874,PART I.,"Wits, warriors, commonwealth's-men, were the best:"
4875,PART I.,"Kind husbands, and mere nobles, all the rest."
4876,PART I.,"And therefore, in the name of dulness, be"
4877,PART I.,The well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free:
4878,PART I.,"And canting Nadab let oblivion damn,"
4879,PART I.,Who made new porridge for the paschal lamb.
4880,PART I.,Let friendship's holy band some names assure;
4881,PART I.,"Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure."
4882,PART I.,"Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place,"
4883,PART I.,"Whom kings no titles gave, and God no grace:                       580"
4884,PART I.,"Not bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes draw"
4885,PART I.,"To mean rebellion, and make treason law."
4886,PART I.,"But he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse,"
4887,PART I.,The wretch who Heaven's anointed dared to curse;
4888,PART I.,"Shimei, whose youth did early promise bring"
4889,PART I.,"Of zeal to God and hatred to his king,"
4890,PART I.,"Did wisely from expensive sins refrain,"
4891,PART I.,And never broke the Sabbath but for gain;
4892,PART I.,"Nor ever was he known an oath to vent,"
4893,PART I.,"Or curse, unless against the government.                           590"
4894,PART I.,Thus heaping wealth by the most ready way
4895,PART I.,"Among the Jews, which was to cheat and pray;"
4896,PART I.,"The city, to reward his pious hate"
4897,PART I.,"Against his master, chose him magistrate."
4898,PART I.,His hand a vare[70] of justice did uphold;
4899,PART I.,His neck was loaded with a chain of gold.
4900,PART I.,During his office treason was no crime;
4901,PART I.,The sons of Belial had a glorious time:
4902,PART I.,"For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,"
4903,PART I.,Yet loved his wicked neighbour as himself.                         600
4904,PART I.,When two or three were gather'd to declaim
4905,PART I.,"Against the monarch of Jerusalem,"
4906,PART I.,Shimei was always in the midst of them;
4907,PART I.,"And if they cursed the king when he was by,"
4908,PART I.,Would rather curse than break good company.
4909,PART I.,"If any durst his factious friends accuse,"
4910,PART I.,He pack'd a jury of dissenting Jews;
4911,PART I.,Whose fellow-feeling in the godly cause
4912,PART I.,Would free the suffering saint from human laws.
4913,PART I.,For laws are only made to punish those                             610
4914,PART I.,"Who serve the king, and to protect his foes."
4915,PART I.,If any leisure time he had from power
4916,PART I.,"(Because 'tis sin to misemploy an hour),"
4917,PART I.,"His business was, by writing to persuade,"
4918,PART I.,That kings were useless and a clog to trade;
4919,PART I.,"And, that his noble style he might refine,"
4920,PART I.,No Rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wind.
4921,PART I.,"Chaste were his cellars, and his shrivel board"
4922,PART I.,The grossness of a city feast abhorr'd;
4923,PART I.,His cooks with long disuse their trade forgot;                     620
4924,PART I.,"Cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot."
4925,PART I.,"Such frugal virtue malice may accuse,"
4926,PART I.,But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews;
4927,PART I.,"For towns, once burnt, such magistrates require"
4928,PART I.,As dare not tempt God's providence by fire.
4929,PART I.,"With spiritual food he fed his servants well,"
4930,PART I.,But free from flesh that made the Jews rebel:
4931,PART I.,"And Moses' laws he held in more account,"
4932,PART I.,For forty days of fasting in the mount.
4933,PART I.,"To speak the rest who better are forgot,                           630"
4934,PART I.,Would tire a well-breathed witness of the plot.
4935,PART I.,"Yet Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass;"
4936,PART I.,"Erect thyself, thou monumental brass,"
4937,PART I.,"High as the serpent of thy metal made,"
4938,PART I.,While nations stand secure beneath thy shade.
4939,PART I.,"What though his birth were base, yet comets rise"
4940,PART I.,"From earthly vapours, ere they shine in skies."
4941,PART I.,Prodigious actions may as well be done
4942,PART I.,"By weaver's issue, as by prince's son."
4943,PART I.,This arch attestor for the public good                             640
4944,PART I.,By that one deed ennobles all his blood.
4945,PART I.,"Who ever ask'd the witness's high race,"
4946,PART I.,Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace?
4947,PART I.,"Ours was a Levite, and as times went then,"
4948,PART I.,His tribe were God Almighty's gentlemen.
4949,PART I.,"Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud,"
4950,PART I.,"Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud."
4951,PART I.,His long chin proved his wit; his saint-like grace
4952,PART I.,"A church vermilion, and a Moses' face."
4953,PART I.,"His memory miraculously great,                                     650"
4954,PART I.,"Could plots, exceeding man's belief, repeat;"
4955,PART I.,"Which therefore cannot be accounted lies,"
4956,PART I.,For human wit could never such devise.
4957,PART I.,Some future truths are mingled in his book;
4958,PART I.,"But where the witness fail'd, the prophet spoke."
4959,PART I.,Some things like visionary flights appear;
4960,PART I.,The spirit caught him up the Lord knows where;
4961,PART I.,"And gave him his rabbinical degree,"
4962,PART I.,Unknown to foreign university.
4963,PART I.,His judgment yet his memory did excel;                             660
4964,PART I.,"Which pieced his wondrous evidence so well,"
4965,PART I.,"And suited to the temper of the times,"
4966,PART I.,Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes.
4967,PART I.,"Let Israel's foes suspect his heavenly call,"
4968,PART I.,And rashly judge his wit apocryphal;
4969,PART I.,Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made;
4970,PART I.,He takes his life who takes away his trade.
4971,PART I.,"Were I myself in witness Corah's place,"
4972,PART I.,"The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace,"
4973,PART I.,"Should whet my memory, though once forgot,                         670"
4974,PART I.,To make him an appendix of my plot.
4975,PART I.,"His zeal to heaven made him his prince despise,"
4976,PART I.,And load his person with indignities.
4977,PART I.,"But zeal peculiar privilege affords,"
4978,PART I.,Indulging latitude to deeds and words:
4979,PART I.,"And Corah might for Agag's murder call,"
4980,PART I.,In terms as coarse as Samuel used to Saul.
4981,PART I.,"What others in his evidence did join,"
4982,PART I.,"The best that could be had for love or coin,"
4983,PART I.,In Corah's own predicament will fall:                              680
4984,PART I.,For witness is a common name to all.
4985,PART I.,
4986,PART I.,"Surrounded thus with friends of every sort,"
4987,PART I.,Deluded Absalom forsakes the court:
4988,PART I.,"Impatient of high hopes, urged with renown,"
4989,PART I.,And fired with near possession of a crown.
4990,PART I.,"The admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise,"
4991,PART I.,And on his goodly person feed their eyes.
4992,PART I.,His joy conceal'd he sets himself to show;
4993,PART I.,On each side bowing popularly low:
4994,PART I.,"His looks, his gestures, and his words he frames,                  690"
4995,PART I.,And with familiar ease repeats their names.
4996,PART I.,"Thus form'd by nature, furnish'd out with arts,"
4997,PART I.,He glides unfelt into their secret hearts.
4998,PART I.,"Then, with a kind compassionating look,"
4999,PART I.,"And sighs, bespeaking pity ere he spoke,"
5000,PART I.,"Few words he said; but easy those and fit,"
5001,PART I.,"More slow than Hybla-drops, and far more sweet."
5002,PART I.,
5003,PART I.,"I mourn, my countrymen, your lost estate;"
5004,PART I.,Though far unable to prevent your fate:
5005,PART I.,Behold a banish'd man for your dear cause                          700
5006,PART I.,Exposed a prey to arbitrary laws!
5007,PART I.,"Yet oh! that I alone could be undone,"
5008,PART I.,"Cut off from empire, and no more a son!"
5009,PART I.,Now all your liberties a spoil are made;
5010,PART I.,"Egypt and Tyrus intercept your trade,"
5011,PART I.,And Jebusites your sacred rites invade.
5012,PART I.,"My father, whom with reverence yet I name,"
5013,PART I.,"Charm'd into ease, is careless of his fame;"
5014,PART I.,"And bribed with petty sums of foreign gold,"
5015,PART I.,Is grown in Bathsheba's embraces old;                              710
5016,PART I.,"Exalts his enemies, his friends destroys,"
5017,PART I.,And all his power against himself employs.
5018,PART I.,"He gives, and let him give, my right away:"
5019,PART I.,But why should he his own and yours betray?
5020,PART I.,"He, only he, can make the nation bleed,"
5021,PART I.,And he alone from my revenge is freed.
5022,PART I.,"Take then my tears (with that he wiped his eyes),"
5023,PART I.,'Tis all the aid my present power supplies:
5024,PART I.,No court-informer can these arms accuse;
5025,PART I.,These arms may sons against their fathers use:                     720
5026,PART I.,"And 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign,"
5027,PART I.,May make no other Israelite complain.
5028,PART I.,
5029,PART I.,"Youth, beauty, graceful action seldom fail;"
5030,PART I.,But common interest always will prevail:
5031,PART I.,And pity never ceases to be shown
5032,PART I.,To him who makes the people's wrongs his own.
5033,PART I.,"The crowd, that still believe their kings oppress,"
5034,PART I.,With lifted hands their young Messiah bless:
5035,PART I.,Who now begins his progress to ordain
5036,PART I.,"With chariots, horsemen, and a numerous train:                     730"
5037,PART I.,"From east to west his glories he displays,"
5038,PART I.,"And, like the sun, the promised land surveys."
5039,PART I.,"Fame runs before him as the morning-star,"
5040,PART I.,And shouts of joy salute him from afar:
5041,PART I.,"Each house receives him as a guardian god,"
5042,PART I.,And consecrates the place of his abode.
5043,PART I.,But hospitable treats did most commend
5044,PART I.,"Wise Issachar, his wealthy western friend."
5045,PART I.,"This moving court, that caught the people's eyes,"
5046,PART I.,"And seem'd but pomp, did other ends disguise:                      740"
5047,PART I.,"Achitophel had form'd it, with intent"
5048,PART I.,"To sound the depths, and fathom where it went,"
5049,PART I.,"The people's hearts, distinguish friends from foes,"
5050,PART I.,"And try their strength, before they came to blows."
5051,PART I.,Yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretence
5052,PART I.,"Of specious love, and duty to their prince."
5053,PART I.,"Religion, and redress of grievances,"
5054,PART I.,"Two names that always cheat, and always please,"
5055,PART I.,Are often urged; and good king David's life
5056,PART I.,Endanger'd by a brother and a wife.                                750
5057,PART I.,Thus in a pageant show a plot is made;
5058,PART I.,And peace itself is war in masquerade.
5059,PART I.,O foolish Israel! never warn'd by ill!
5060,PART I.,"Still the same bait, and circumvented still!"
5061,PART I.,"Did ever men forsake their present ease,"
5062,PART I.,In midst of health imagine a disease;
5063,PART I.,"Take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee,"
5064,PART I.,"Make heirs for monarchs, and for God decree?"
5065,PART I.,"What shall we think? Can people give away,"
5066,PART I.,"Both for themselves and sons, their native sway?                   760"
5067,PART I.,Then they are left defenceless to the sword
5068,PART I.,"Of each unbounded, arbitrary lord:"
5069,PART I.,"And laws are vain, by which we right enjoy,"

5128,PART I.,In regions waste beyond the Jordan's flood:                        820
5129,PART I.,Unfortunately brave to buoy the state;
5130,PART I.,But sinking underneath his master's fate:

5133,PART I.,"The court he practised, not the courtier's art:"

5137,PART I.,His bed could once a fruitful issue boast;
5138,PART I.,Now more than half a father's name is lost.                        830
5139,PART I.,"His eldest hope, with every grace adorn'd,"
5140,PART I.,"By me, so Heaven will have it, always mourn'd,"

5142,PART I.,"By unequal fates, and providence's crime:"
5143,PART I.,"Yet not before the goal of honour won,"
5144,PART I.,All parts fulfill'd of subject and of son:

5150,PART I.,Thy force infused the fainting Tyrians propp'd;
5151,PART I.,And haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stopp'd.
5152,PART I.,"O ancient honour! O unconquer'd hand,"
5153,PART I.,Whom foes unpunish'd never could withstand!
5154,PART I.,But Israel was unworthy of his name;
5155,PART I.,Short is the date of all immoderate fame.
5156,PART I.,"It looks as Heaven our ruin had design'd,"
5157,PART I.,And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind.

5159,PART I.,"Mounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole:"

5161,PART I.,To aid the guardian angel of thy king.
5162,PART I.,
5163,PART I.,"Here stop, my muse, here cease thy painful flight:"
5164,PART I.,No pinions can pursue immortal height:
5165,PART I.,"Tell good Barzillai thou canst sing no more,"
5166,PART I.,And tell thy soul she should have fled before:
5167,PART I.,"Or fled she with his life, and left this verse"
5168,PART I.,To hang on her departed patron's hearse?
5169,PART I.,"Now take thy steepy flight from heaven, and see                    860"
5170,PART I.,If thou canst find on earth another he:

5173,PART I.,"Zadoc the priest, whom, shunning power and place,"
5174,PART I.,His lowly mind advanced to David's grace.
5175,PART I.,"With him the Sagan of Jerusalem,"
5176,PART I.,"Of hospitable soul, and noble stem;"
5177,PART I.,"Him[71] of the western dome, whose weighty sense"
5178,PART I.,Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence.

5181,PART I.,"For colleges on bounteous kings depend,"
5182,PART I.,And never rebel was to arts a friend.
5183,PART I.,"To these succeed the pillars of the laws,"
5184,PART I.,"Who best can plead, and best can judge a cause."
5185,PART I.,Next them a train of loyal peers ascend;
5186,PART I.,"Sharp-judging Adriel, the Muses' friend,"
5187,PART I.,Himself a Muse: in Sanhedrim's debate
5188,PART I.,"True to his prince, but not a slave of state:"
5189,PART I.,"Whom David's love with honours did adorn,                          880"
5190,PART I.,That from his disobedient son were torn.
5191,PART I.,"Jotham, of piercing wit, and pregnant thought;"
5192,PART I.,"Endued by nature, and by learning taught"
5193,PART I.,"To move assemblies, who but only tried"
5194,PART I.,"The worse awhile, then chose the better side:"
5195,PART I.,"Nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too,--"
5196,PART I.,So much the weight of one brave man can do.
5197,PART I.,"Hushai, the friend of David in distress;"

5199,PART I.,"By foreign treaties he inform'd his youth,                         890"
5200,PART I.,And join'd experience to his native truth.
5201,PART I.,His frugal care supplied the wanting throne--
5202,PART I.,"Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own:"
5203,PART I.,'Tis easy conduct when exchequers flow;
5204,PART I.,But hard the task to manage well the low;
5205,PART I.,"For sovereign power is too depress'd or high,"
5206,PART I.,"When kings are forced to sell, or crowds to buy."
5207,PART I.,"Indulge one labour more, my weary muse,"
5208,PART I.,For Amiel: who can Amiel's praise refuse?
5209,PART I.,"Of ancient race by birth, but nobler yet                           900"
5210,PART I.,"In his own worth, and without title great:"
5211,PART I.,"The Sanhedrim long time as chief he ruled,"
5212,PART I.,"Their reason guided, and their passion cool'd:"
5213,PART I.,"So dexterous was he in the crown's defence,"
5214,PART I.,"So form'd to speak a loyal nation's sense,"

5231,PART I.,The true successor from the court removed;
5232,PART I.,"The plot, by hireling witnesses, improved."
5233,PART I.,"These ills they saw, and, as their duty bound,"
5234,PART I.,They show'd the King the danger of the wound;
5235,PART I.,"That no concessions from the throne would please,"
5236,PART I.,But lenitives fomented the disease:
5237,PART I.,"That Absalom, ambitious of the crown,"
5238,PART I.,Was made the lure to draw the people down:
5239,PART I.,That false Achitophel's pernicious hate
5240,PART I.,Had turn'd the Plot to ruin church and state:                      930
5241,PART I.,"The council violent, the rabble worse:"

5254,PART I.,So much the father did the king assuage.

5256,PART I.,The offenders question my forgiving right:

5259,PART I.,"They call my tenderness of blood, my fear:"
5260,PART I.,Though manly tempers can the longest bear.
5261,PART I.,"Yet, since they will divert my native course,"

5263,PART I.,"Those heap'd affronts that haughty subjects bring,"
5264,PART I.,"Are burdens for a camel, not a king."
5265,PART I.,"Kings are the public pillars of the state,"
5266,PART I.,Born to sustain and prop the nation's weight:

5268,PART I.,"To shake the column, let him share the fall:"
5269,PART I.,"But oh, that yet he would repent and live!"

5273,PART I.,"Poor, pitied youth, by my paternal care,"
5274,PART I.,Raised up to all the height his frame could bear!
5275,PART I.,"Had God ordain'd his fate for empire born,"
5276,PART I.,He would have given his soul another turn:
5277,PART I.,"Gull'd with a patriot's name, whose modern sense"

5279,PART I.,"The people's brave, the politician's tool;"

5281,PART I.,"Whence comes it, that religion and the laws"

5283,PART I.,"His old instructor, ere he lost his place,"
5284,PART I.,Was never thought endued with so much grace.
5285,PART I.,"Good heavens, how faction can a patriot paint!"
5286,PART I.,My rebel ever proves my people's saint.
5287,PART I.,"Would they impose an heir upon the throne,"
5288,PART I.,Let Sanhedrims be taught to give their own.
5289,PART I.,A king's at least a part of government;

5297,PART I.,"From plots and treasons Heaven preserve my years,"
5298,PART I.,But save me most from my petitioners!
5299,PART I.,"Insatiate as the barren womb or grave,"
5300,PART I.,God cannot grant so much as they can crave.
5301,PART I.,"What then is left, but with a jealous eye"
5302,PART I.,To guard the small remains of royalty?                             990
5303,PART I.,"The law shall still direct my peaceful sway,"

5315,PART I.,"Oh, cursed effects of necessary law!"

5419,DERRICK.,And in the depths they knew disdain'd to ride.
5420,DERRICK.,"For probable discoveries to dispense,"
5421,DERRICK.,Was thought below a pension'd evidence;
5422,DERRICK.,"Mere truth was dull, nor suited with the port"
5423,DERRICK.,Of pamper'd Corah when advanced to court.
5424,DERRICK.,"No less than wonders now they will impose,"
5425,DERRICK.,And projects void of grace or sense disclose.                       50
5426,DERRICK.,"Such was the charge on pious Michal brought,--"
5427,DERRICK.,"Michal that ne'er was cruel, even in thought,--"
5428,DERRICK.,"The best of queens, and most obedient wife,"
5429,DERRICK.,Impeach'd of cursed designs on David's life!
5430,DERRICK.,"His life, the theme of her eternal prayer,"
5431,DERRICK.,'Tis scarce so much his guardian angel's care.
5432,DERRICK.,"Not summer morns such mildness can disclose,"
5433,DERRICK.,"The Hermon lily, nor the Sharon rose."
5434,DERRICK.,"Neglecting each vain pomp of majesty,"
5435,DERRICK.,Transported Michal feeds her thoughts on high.                      60
5436,DERRICK.,"She lives with angels, and, as angels do,"
5437,DERRICK.,Quits heaven sometimes to bless the world below;
5438,DERRICK.,"Where, cherish'd by her bounties' plenteous spring,"
5439,DERRICK.,"Reviving widows smile, and orphans sing."
5440,DERRICK.,"Oh! when rebellious Israel's crimes at height,"
5441,DERRICK.,"Are threaten'd with her Lord's approaching fate,"
5442,DERRICK.,The piety of Michal then remain
5443,DERRICK.,"In Heaven's remembrance, and prolong his reign!"
5444,DERRICK.,
5445,DERRICK.,"Less desolation did the pest pursue,"
5446,DERRICK.,That from Dan's limits to Beersheba flew;                           70
5447,DERRICK.,"Less fatal the repeated wars of Tyre,"
5448,DERRICK.,And less Jerusalem's avenging fire.
5449,DERRICK.,"With gentler terror these our state o'erran,"
5450,DERRICK.,Than since our evidencing days began!
5451,DERRICK.,"On every cheek a pale confusion sate,"
5452,DERRICK.,Continued fear beyond the worst of fate!
5453,DERRICK.,"Trust was no more; art, science useless made;"
5454,DERRICK.,All occupations lost but Corah's trade.
5455,DERRICK.,"Meanwhile a guard on modest Corah wait,"
5456,DERRICK.,"If not for safety, needful yet for state.                           80"
5457,DERRICK.,"Well might he deem each peer and prince his slave,"
5458,DERRICK.,And lord it o'er the tribes which he could save:
5459,DERRICK.,"Even vice in him was virtue--what sad fate,"
5460,DERRICK.,But for his honesty had seized our state!
5461,DERRICK.,"And with what tyranny had we been cursed,"
5462,DERRICK.,Had Corah never proved a villain first!
5463,DERRICK.,"To have told his knowledge of the intrigue in gross,"
5464,DERRICK.,"Had been, alas! to our deponent's loss:"
5465,DERRICK.,"The travell'd Levite had the experience got,"
5466,DERRICK.,"To husband well, and make the best of's Plot;                       90"
5467,DERRICK.,"And therefore, like an evidence of skill,"
5468,DERRICK.,With wise reserves secured his pension still;
5469,DERRICK.,"Nor quite of future power himself bereft,"
5470,DERRICK.,But limbos large for unbelievers left.
5471,DERRICK.,"And now his writ such reverence had got,"
5472,DERRICK.,'Twas worse than plotting to suspect his Plot.
5473,DERRICK.,"Some were so well convinced, they made no doubt"
5474,DERRICK.,Themselves to help the founder'd swearers out.
5475,DERRICK.,"Some had their sense imposed on by their fear,"
5476,DERRICK.,But more for interest sake believe and swear:                      100
5477,DERRICK.,"Even to that height with some the frenzy grew,"
5478,DERRICK.,They raged to find their danger not prove true.
5479,DERRICK.,
5480,DERRICK.,"Yet, than all these a viler crew remain,"
5481,DERRICK.,Who with Achitophel the cry maintain;
5482,DERRICK.,"Not urged by fear, nor through misguided sense,--"
5483,DERRICK.,Blind zeal and starving need had some pretence;
5484,DERRICK.,"But for the good old cause, that did excite"
5485,DERRICK.,The original rebels' wiles--revenge and spite.
5486,DERRICK.,"These raise the plot, to have the scandal thrown"
5487,DERRICK.,"Upon the bright successor of the crown,                            110"
5488,DERRICK.,"Whose virtue with such wrongs they had pursued,"
5489,DERRICK.,As seem'd all hope of pardon to exclude.
5490,DERRICK.,"Thus, while on private ends their zeal is built,"
5491,DERRICK.,"The cheated crowd applaud, and share their guilt."
5492,DERRICK.,
5493,DERRICK.,"Such practices as these, too gross to lie"
5494,DERRICK.,"Long unobserved by each discerning eye,"
5495,DERRICK.,"The more judicious Israelites unspell'd,"
5496,DERRICK.,Though still the charm the giddy rabble held.
5497,DERRICK.,"Even Absalom, amidst the dazzling beams"
5498,DERRICK.,"Of empire, and ambition's flattering dreams,                       120"
5499,DERRICK.,"Perceives the plot, too foul to be excused,"
5500,DERRICK.,"To aid designs, no less pernicious, used."
5501,DERRICK.,"And, filial sense yet striving in his breast,"
5502,DERRICK.,Thus to Achitophel his doubts express'd:
5503,DERRICK.,
5504,DERRICK.,Why are my thoughts upon a crown employ'd.
5505,DERRICK.,"Which, once obtain'd, can be but half enjoy'd?"
5506,DERRICK.,"Not so when virtue did my arms require,"
5507,DERRICK.,And to my father's wars I flew entire.
5508,DERRICK.,"My regal power how will my foes resent,"
5509,DERRICK.,When I myself have scarce my own consent!                          130
5510,DERRICK.,"Give me a son's unblemish'd truth again,"
5511,DERRICK.,Or quench the sparks of duty that remain.
5512,DERRICK.,How slight to force a throne that legions guard
5513,DERRICK.,"The task to me! to prove unjust, how hard!"
5514,DERRICK.,"And if the imagined guilt thus wound my thought,"
5515,DERRICK.,What will it when the tragic scene is wrought!
5516,DERRICK.,"Dire war must first be conjured from below,"
5517,DERRICK.,The realm we rule we first must overthrow;
5518,DERRICK.,"And, when the civil furies are on wing,"
5519,DERRICK.,"That blind and undistinguish'd slaughters fling,                   140"
5520,DERRICK.,Who knows what impious chance may reach the king?
5521,DERRICK.,"Oh, rather let me perish in the strife,"
5522,DERRICK.,Than have my crown the price of David's life!
5523,DERRICK.,"Or if the tempest of the war he stand,"
5524,DERRICK.,"In peace, some vile officious villain's hand"
5525,DERRICK.,His soul's anointed temple may invade;
5526,DERRICK.,"Or, press'd by clamorous crowds, myself be made"
5527,DERRICK.,"His murderer; rebellious crowds, whose guilt"
5528,DERRICK.,Shall dread his vengeance till his blood be spilt.
5529,DERRICK.,"Which, if my filial tenderness oppose,                             150"
5530,DERRICK.,"Since to the empire by their arms I rose,"
5531,DERRICK.,"Those very arms on me shall be employ'd,"
5532,DERRICK.,"A new usurper crown'd, and I destroy'd:"
5533,DERRICK.,"The same pretence of public good will hold,"
5534,DERRICK.,And new Achitophels be found as bold
5535,DERRICK.,To urge the needful change--perhaps the old.
5536,DERRICK.,
5537,DERRICK.,"He said. The statesman with a smile replies,"
5538,DERRICK.,A smile that did his rising spleen disguise:
5539,DERRICK.,My thoughts presumed our labours at an end;
5540,DERRICK.,And are we still with conscience to contend?                       160
5541,DERRICK.,"Whose want in kings as needful is allow'd,"
5542,DERRICK.,As 'tis for them to find it in the crowd.
5543,DERRICK.,"Far in the doubtful passage you are gone,"
5544,DERRICK.,And only can be safe by pressing on.
5545,DERRICK.,"The crown's true heir, a prince severe and wise,"
5546,DERRICK.,"Has view'd your motions long with jealous eyes,"
5547,DERRICK.,"Your person's charms, your more prevailing arts,"
5548,DERRICK.,"And mark'd your progress in the people's hearts,"
5549,DERRICK.,"Whose patience is the effect of stinted power,"
5550,DERRICK.,But treasures vengeance for the fatal hour;                        170
5551,DERRICK.,"And if remote the peril he can bring,"
5552,DERRICK.,Your present danger's greater from the king.
5553,DERRICK.,"Let not a parent's name deceive your sense,"
5554,DERRICK.,Nor trust the father in a jealous prince!
5555,DERRICK.,"Your trivial faults if he could so resent,"
5556,DERRICK.,"To doom you little less than banishment,"
5557,DERRICK.,What rage must your presumption since inspire!
5558,DERRICK.,Against his orders you return from Tyre.
5559,DERRICK.,"Nor only so, but with a pomp more high,"
5560,DERRICK.,"And open court of popularity,                                      180"
5561,DERRICK.,The factious tribes.--And this reproof from thee!
5562,DERRICK.,"The prince replies; Oh, statesman's winding skill,"
5563,DERRICK.,They first condemn that first advised the ill!
5564,DERRICK.,
5565,DERRICK.,"Illustrious youth! returned Achitophel,"
5566,DERRICK.,Misconstrue not the words that mean you well;
5567,DERRICK.,"The course you steer I worthy blame conclude,"
5568,DERRICK.,But 'tis because you leave it unpursued.
5569,DERRICK.,"A monarch's crown with fate surrounded lies,"
5570,DERRICK.,"Who reach, lay hold on death that miss the prize."
5571,DERRICK.,"Did you for this expose yourself to show,                          190"
5572,DERRICK.,And to the crowd bow popularly low?
5573,DERRICK.,"For this your glorious progress next ordain,"
5574,DERRICK.,"With chariots, horsemen, and a numerous train?"
5575,DERRICK.,"With fame before you, like the morning star,"
5576,DERRICK.,And shouts of joy saluting from afar?
5577,DERRICK.,"Oh, from the heights you've reach'd but take a view,"
5578,DERRICK.,Scarce leading Lucifer could fall like you!
5579,DERRICK.,And must I here my shipwreck'd arts bemoan?
5580,DERRICK.,Have I for this so oft made Israel groan?
5581,DERRICK.,"Your single interest with the nation weigh'd,                      200"
5582,DERRICK.,And turn'd the scale where your desires were laid;
5583,DERRICK.,Even when at helm a course so dangerous moved
5584,DERRICK.,"To land your hopes, as my removal proved.--"
5585,DERRICK.,
5586,DERRICK.,"I not dispute, the royal youth replies,"
5587,DERRICK.,The known perfection of your policies;
5588,DERRICK.,Nor in Achitophel yet grudge or blame
5589,DERRICK.,The privilege that statesmen ever claim;
5590,DERRICK.,"Who private interest never yet pursued,"
5591,DERRICK.,But still pretended 'twas for others good:
5592,DERRICK.,"What politician yet e'er 'scaped his fate,                         210"
5593,DERRICK.,"Who, saving his own neck, not saved the state?"
5594,DERRICK.,"From hence, on every humorous wind that veer'd,"
5595,DERRICK.,With shifted sails a several course you steer'd.
5596,DERRICK.,"What form of sway did David e'er pursue,"
5597,DERRICK.,"That seem'd like absolute, but sprung from you?"
5598,DERRICK.,"Who at your instance quash'd each penal law,"
5599,DERRICK.,That kept dissenting factious Jews in awe;
5600,DERRICK.,"And who suspends fix'd laws, may abrogate,"
5601,DERRICK.,"That done, form new, and so enslave the state."
5602,DERRICK.,"Even property whose champion now you stand,                        220"
5603,DERRICK.,"And seem for this the idol of the land,"
5604,DERRICK.,"Did ne'er sustain such violence before,"
5605,DERRICK.,As when your counsel shut the royal store;
5606,DERRICK.,"Advice, that ruin to whole tribes procured,"
5607,DERRICK.,But secret kept till your own banks secured.
5608,DERRICK.,"Recount with this the triple covenant broke,"
5609,DERRICK.,And Israel fitted for a foreign yoke;
5610,DERRICK.,"Nor here your counsel's fatal progress stay'd,"
5611,DERRICK.,But sent our levied powers to Pharaoh's aid.
5612,DERRICK.,"Hence Tyre and Israel, low in ruins laid,                          230"
5613,DERRICK.,"And Egypt, once their scorn, their common terror made."
5614,DERRICK.,"Even yet of such a season can we dream,"
5615,DERRICK.,When royal rights you made your darling theme.
5616,DERRICK.,"For power unlimited could reasons draw,"
5617,DERRICK.,And place prerogative above the law;
5618,DERRICK.,"Which, on your fall from office, grew unjust,"
5619,DERRICK.,"The laws made king, the king a slave in trust:"
5620,DERRICK.,"Whom with state-craft, to interest only true,"
5621,DERRICK.,You now accuse of ills contrived by you.
5622,DERRICK.,
5623,DERRICK.,"To this hell's agent: Royal youth, fix here,                      240"
5624,DERRICK.,Let interest be the star by which you steer.
5625,DERRICK.,"Hence to repose your trust in me was wise,"
5626,DERRICK.,Whose interest most in your advancement lies.
5627,DERRICK.,"A tie so firm as always will avail,"
5628,DERRICK.,"When friendship, nature, and religion fail;"
5629,DERRICK.,On ours the safety of the crowd depends;
5630,DERRICK.,"Secure the crowd, and we obtain our ends,"
5631,DERRICK.,"Whom I will cause so far our guilt to share,"
5632,DERRICK.,Till they are made our champions by their fear.
5633,DERRICK.,"What opposition can your rival bring,                              250"
5634,DERRICK.,While Sanhedrims are jealous of the king?
5635,DERRICK.,"His strength as yet in David's friendship lies,"
5636,DERRICK.,And what can David's self without supplies?
5637,DERRICK.,"Who with exclusive bills must now dispense,"
5638,DERRICK.,"Debar the heir, or starve in his defence."
5639,DERRICK.,"Conditions which our elders ne'er will quit,"
5640,DERRICK.,And David's justice never can admit.
5641,DERRICK.,"Or forced by wants his brother to betray,"
5642,DERRICK.,To your ambition next he clears the way;
5643,DERRICK.,"For if succession once to nought they bring,                       260"
5644,DERRICK.,Their next advance removes the present king:
5645,DERRICK.,"Persisting else his senates to dissolve,"
5646,DERRICK.,In equal hazard shall his reign involve.
5647,DERRICK.,"Our tribes, whom Pharaoh's power so much alarms,"
5648,DERRICK.,Shall rise without their prince to oppose his arms;
5649,DERRICK.,"Nor boots it on what cause at first they join,"
5650,DERRICK.,"Their troops, once up, are tools for our design."
5651,DERRICK.,"At least such subtle covenants shall be made,"
5652,DERRICK.,Till peace itself is war in masquerade.
5653,DERRICK.,"Associations of mysterious sense,                                  270"
5654,DERRICK.,"Against, but seeming for, the king's defence:"
5655,DERRICK.,"Even on their courts of justice fetters draw,"
5656,DERRICK.,And from our agents muzzle up their law.
5657,DERRICK.,"By which a conquest if we fail to make,"
5658,DERRICK.,"'Tis a drawn game at worst, and we secure our stake."
5659,DERRICK.,
5660,DERRICK.,"He said, and for the dire success depends"
5661,DERRICK.,"On various sects, by common guilt made friends."
5662,DERRICK.,"Whose heads, though ne'er so differing in their creed,"
5663,DERRICK.,I' th' point of treason yet were well agreed.
5664,DERRICK.,"'Mongst these, extorting Ishban first appears,                     280"
5665,DERRICK.,Pursued by a meagre troop of bankrupt heirs.
5666,DERRICK.,"Blest times when Ishban, he whose occupation"
5667,DERRICK.,"So long has been to cheat, reforms the nation!"
5668,DERRICK.,"Ishban of conscience suited to his trade,"
5669,DERRICK.,As good a saint as usurer ever made.
5670,DERRICK.,"Yet Mammon has not so engross'd him quite,"
5671,DERRICK.,But Belial lays as large a claim of spite;
5672,DERRICK.,"Who, for those pardons from his prince he draws,"
5673,DERRICK.,"Returns reproaches, and cries up the cause."
5674,DERRICK.,"That year in which the city he did sway,                           290"
5675,DERRICK.,"He left rebellion in a hopeful way,"
5676,DERRICK.,"Yet his ambition once was found so bold,"
5677,DERRICK.,To offer talents of extorted gold;
5678,DERRICK.,"Could David's wants have so been bribed, to shame"
5679,DERRICK.,And scandalize our peerage with his name;
5680,DERRICK.,"For which, his dear sedition he'd forswear,"
5681,DERRICK.,And e'en turn loyal to be made a peer.
5682,DERRICK.,"Next him, let railing Rabsheka have place,"
5683,DERRICK.,So full of zeal he has no need of grace;
5684,DERRICK.,"A saint that can both flesh and spirit use,                        300"
5685,DERRICK.,Alike haunt conventicles and the stews:
5686,DERRICK.,"Of whom the question difficult appears,"
5687,DERRICK.,If most i' th' preacher's or the bawd's arrears.
5688,DERRICK.,What caution could appear too much in him
5689,DERRICK.,That keeps the treasure of Jerusalem!
5690,DERRICK.,"Let David's brother but approach the town,"
5691,DERRICK.,"Double our guards, he cries, we are undone."
5692,DERRICK.,Protesting that he dares not sleep in 's bed
5693,DERRICK.,Lest he should rise next morn without his head.
5694,DERRICK.,
5695,DERRICK.,"Next[74] these, a troop of busy spirits press,                    310"
5696,DERRICK.,"Of little fortunes, and of conscience less;"
5697,DERRICK.,"With them the tribe, whose luxury had drain'd"
5698,DERRICK.,"Their banks, in former sequestrations gain'd;"
5699,DERRICK.,"Who rich and great by past rebellions grew,"
5700,DERRICK.,And long to fish the troubled streams anew.
5701,DERRICK.,"Some future hopes, some present payment draws,"
5702,DERRICK.,To sell their conscience and espouse the cause.
5703,DERRICK.,"Such stipends those vile hirelings best befit,                     318"
5704,DERRICK.,"Priests without grace, and poets without wit."
5705,DERRICK.,"Shall that false Hebronite escape our curse,"
5706,DERRICK.,"Judas, that keeps the rebels' pension-purse;"
5707,DERRICK.,"Judas, that pays the treason-writer's fee,"
5708,DERRICK.,"Judas, that well deserves his namesake's tree;"
5709,DERRICK.,Who at Jerusalem's own gates erects
5710,DERRICK.,His college for a nursery of sects;
5711,DERRICK.,"Young prophets with an early care secures,"
5712,DERRICK.,And with the dung of his own arts manures!
5713,DERRICK.,What have the men of Hebron here to do?
5714,DERRICK.,What part in Israel's promised land have you?
5715,DERRICK.,"Here Phaleg the lay-Hebronite is come,                             330"
5716,DERRICK.,'Cause like the rest he could not live at home;
5717,DERRICK.,Who from his own possessions could not drain
5718,DERRICK.,An omer even of Hebronitish grain;
5719,DERRICK.,"Here struts it like a patriot, and talks high"
5720,DERRICK.,"Of injured subjects, alter'd property:"
5721,DERRICK.,"An emblem of that buzzing insect just,"
5722,DERRICK.,"That mounts the wheel, and thinks she raises dust."
5723,DERRICK.,Can dry bones live? or skeletons produce
5724,DERRICK.,The vital warmth of cuckoldising juice?
5725,DERRICK.,"Slim Phaleg could, and at the table fed,                           340"
5726,DERRICK.,Return'd the grateful product to the bed.
5727,DERRICK.,"A waiting-man to travelling nobles chose,"
5728,DERRICK.,"He his own laws would saucily impose,"
5729,DERRICK.,"Till bastinadoed back again he went,"
5730,DERRICK.,To learn those manners he to teach was sent.
5731,DERRICK.,"Chastised he ought to have retreated home,"
5732,DERRICK.,But he reads politics to Absalom.
5733,DERRICK.,"For never Hebronite, though kick'd and scorn'd,"
5734,DERRICK.,To his own country willingly return'd.
5735,DERRICK.,"--But leaving famish'd Phaleg to be fed,                           350"
5736,DERRICK.,"And to talk treason for his daily bread,"
5737,DERRICK.,"Let Hebron, nay let hell, produce a man"
5738,DERRICK.,So made for mischief as Ben-Jochanan.
5739,DERRICK.,"A Jew of humble parentage was he,"
5740,DERRICK.,"By trade a Levite, though of low degree:"
5741,DERRICK.,"His pride no higher than the desk aspired,"
5742,DERRICK.,But for the drudgery of priests was hired
5743,DERRICK.,"To read and pray in linen ephod brave,"
5744,DERRICK.,And pick up single shekels from the grave.
5745,DERRICK.,"Married at last, but finding charge come faster,                   360"
5746,DERRICK.,"He could not live by God, but changed his master:"
5747,DERRICK.,"Inspired by want, was made a factious tool,"
5748,DERRICK.,"They got a villain, and we lost a fool."
5749,DERRICK.,"Still violent, whatever cause he took,"
5750,DERRICK.,But most against the party he forsook;
5751,DERRICK.,"For renegadoes, who ne'er turn by halves,"
5752,DERRICK.,Are bound in conscience to be double knaves.
5753,DERRICK.,So this prose-prophet took most monstrous pains
5754,DERRICK.,To let his masters see he earn'd his gains.
5755,DERRICK.,"But, as the devil owes all his imps a shame,                       370"
5756,DERRICK.,He chose the apostate for his proper theme;
5757,DERRICK.,"With little pains he made the picture true,"
5758,DERRICK.,And from reflection took the rogue he drew.
5759,DERRICK.,"A wondrous work, to prove the Jewish nation"
5760,DERRICK.,In every age a murmuring generation;
5761,DERRICK.,"To trace them from their infancy of sinning,"
5762,DERRICK.,And show them factious from their first beginning.
5763,DERRICK.,"To prove they could rebel, and rail, and mock,"
5764,DERRICK.,Much to the credit of the chosen flock;
5765,DERRICK.,"A strong authority which must convince,                            380"
5766,DERRICK.,That saints own no allegiance to their prince;
5767,DERRICK.,"As 'tis a leading-card to make a whore,"
5768,DERRICK.,To prove her mother had turn'd up before.
5769,DERRICK.,"But, tell me, did the drunken patriarch bless"
5770,DERRICK.,The son that show'd his father's nakedness?
5771,DERRICK.,"Such thanks the present church thy pen will give,"
5772,DERRICK.,Which proves rebellion was so primitive.
5773,DERRICK.,Must ancient failings be examples made?
5774,DERRICK.,Then murderers from Cain may learn their trade.
5775,DERRICK.,"As thou the heathen and the saint hast drawn,                      390"
5776,DERRICK.,Methinks the apostate was the better man:
5777,DERRICK.,"And thy hot father, waving my respect,"
5778,DERRICK.,Not of a mother-church but of a sect.
5779,DERRICK.,And such he needs must be of thy inditing;
5780,DERRICK.,This comes of drinking asses' milk and writing.
5781,DERRICK.,"If Balak should be call'd to leave his place,"
5782,DERRICK.,"As profit is the loudest call of grace,"
5783,DERRICK.,"His temple, dispossess'd of one, would be"
5784,DERRICK.,Replenished with seven devils more by thee.
5785,DERRICK.,
5786,DERRICK.,"Levi, thou art a load, I'll lay thee down,                        400"
5787,DERRICK.,"And show Rebellion bare, without a gown;"
5788,DERRICK.,"Poor slaves in metre, dull and addle-pated,"
5789,DERRICK.,Who rhyme below even David's psalms translated;
5790,DERRICK.,"Some in my speedy pace I must outrun,"
5791,DERRICK.,As lame Mephibosheth the wizard's son:
5792,DERRICK.,"To make quick way I'll leap o'er heavy blocks,"
5793,DERRICK.,"Shun rotten Uzza, as I would the pox;"
5794,DERRICK.,"And hasten Og and Doeg to rehearse,"
5795,DERRICK.,Two fools that crutch their feeble sense on verse:
5796,DERRICK.,"Who, by my muse, to all succeeding times                           410"
5797,DERRICK.,Shall live in spite of their own doggrel rhymes.
5798,DERRICK.,
5799,DERRICK.,"Doeg, though without knowing how or why,"
5800,DERRICK.,Made still a blundering kind of melody;
5801,DERRICK.,"Spurr'd boldly on, and dash'd through thick and thin,"
5802,DERRICK.,"Through sense and nonsense, never out nor in;"
5803,DERRICK.,"Free from all meaning, whether good or bad,"
5804,DERRICK.,"And, in one word, heroically mad:"
5805,DERRICK.,"He was too warm on picking-work to dwell,"
5806,DERRICK.,"But fagoted his notions as they fell,"
5807,DERRICK.,"And if they rhymed and rattled, all was well.                      420"
5808,DERRICK.,"Spiteful he is not, though he wrote a satire,"
5809,DERRICK.,For still there goes some thinking to ill-nature:
5810,DERRICK.,"He needs no more than birds and beasts to think,"
5811,DERRICK.,All his occasions are to eat and drink.
5812,DERRICK.,"If he call rogue and rascal from a garret,"
5813,DERRICK.,He means you no more mischief than a parrot;
5814,DERRICK.,"The words for friend and foe alike were made,"
5815,DERRICK.,To fetter them in verse is all his trade.
5816,DERRICK.,For almonds he'll cry whore to his own mother:
5817,DERRICK.,And call young Absalom king David's brother.                       430
5818,DERRICK.,"Let him be gallows-free by my consent,"
5819,DERRICK.,"And nothing suffer, since he nothing meant."
5820,DERRICK.,Hanging supposes human soul and reason--
5821,DERRICK.,This animal's below committing treason:
5822,DERRICK.,Shall he be hang'd who never could rebel?
5823,DERRICK.,That's a preferment for Achitophel.
5824,DERRICK.,The woman.......
5825,DERRICK.,Was rightly sentenced by the law to die;
5826,DERRICK.,But 'twas hard fate that to the gallows led
5827,DERRICK.,The dog that never heard the statute read.                         440
5828,DERRICK.,"Railing in other men may be a crime,"
5829,DERRICK.,But ought to pass for mere instinct in him:
5830,DERRICK.,"Instinct he follows, and no further knows,"
5831,DERRICK.,For to write verse with him is to transpose.
5832,DERRICK.,"'Twere pity treason at his door to lay,"
5833,DERRICK.,_Who makes heaven's gate a lock to its own key_:[75]
5834,DERRICK.,"Let him rail on, let his invective muse"
5835,DERRICK.,"Have four and twenty letters to abuse,"
5836,DERRICK.,"Which, if he jumbles to one line of sense,"
5837,DERRICK.,Indict him of a capital offence.                                   450
5838,DERRICK.,In fireworks give him leave to vent his spite--
5839,DERRICK.,Those are the only serpents he can write;
5840,DERRICK.,"The height of his ambition is, we know,"
5841,DERRICK.,But to be master of a puppet-show;
5842,DERRICK.,"On that one stage his works may yet appear,"
5843,DERRICK.,And a month's harvest keeps him all the year.
5844,DERRICK.,
5845,DERRICK.,"Now stop your noses, readers, all and some,"
5846,DERRICK.,For here's a tun of midnight work to come;
5847,DERRICK.,"Og, from a treason-tavern rolling home,"
5848,DERRICK.,"Round as a globe, and liquor'd every chink,                        460"
5849,DERRICK.,Goodly and great he sails behind his link;
5850,DERRICK.,"With all this bulk there's nothing lost in Og,"
5851,DERRICK.,For every inch that is not fool is rogue:
5852,DERRICK.,"A monstrous mass of foul corrupted matter,"
5853,DERRICK.,As all the devils had spued to make the batter.
5854,DERRICK.,"When wine has given him courage to blaspheme,"
5855,DERRICK.,"He curses God, but God before cursed him;"
5856,DERRICK.,"And if man could have reason, none has more,"
5857,DERRICK.,"That made his paunch so rich, and him so poor."
5858,DERRICK.,"With wealth he was not trusted, for Heaven knew                    470"
5859,DERRICK.,What 'twas of old to pamper up a Jew;
5860,DERRICK.,"To what would he on quail and pheasant swell,"
5861,DERRICK.,That even on tripe and carrion could rebel?
5862,DERRICK.,"But though Heaven made him poor (with reverence speaking),"
5863,DERRICK.,He never was a poet of God's making;
5864,DERRICK.,"The midwife laid her hand on his thick skull,"
5865,DERRICK.,With this prophetic blessing--Be thou dull;
5866,DERRICK.,"Drink, swear, and roar, forbear no lewd delight"
5867,DERRICK.,Fit for thy bulk--do anything but write:
5868,DERRICK.,"Thou art of lasting make, like thoughtless men,                    480"
5869,DERRICK.,A strong nativity--but for the pen!
5870,DERRICK.,"Eat opium, mingle arsenic in thy drink,"
5871,DERRICK.,"Still thou mayst live, avoiding pen and ink."
5872,DERRICK.,"I see, I see, 'tis counsel given in vain,"
5873,DERRICK.,For treason botch'd in rhyme will be thy bane;
5874,DERRICK.,"Rhyme is the rock on which thou art to wreck,"
5875,DERRICK.,'Tis fatal to thy fame and to thy neck:
5876,DERRICK.,Why should thy metre good king David blast?
5877,DERRICK.,A psalm of his will surely be thy last.
5878,DERRICK.,"Dar'st thou presume in verse to meet thy foes,                     490"
5879,DERRICK.,Thou whom the penny pamphlet foil'd in prose?
5880,DERRICK.,"Doeg, whom God for mankind's mirth has made,"
5881,DERRICK.,O'ertops thy talent in thy very trade;
5882,DERRICK.,"Doeg to thee, thy paintings are so coarse,"
5883,DERRICK.,"A poet is, though he's the poet's horse."
5884,DERRICK.,"A double noose thou on thy neck dost pull,"
5885,DERRICK.,"For writing treason, and for writing dull;"
5886,DERRICK.,"To die for faction is a common evil,"
5887,DERRICK.,But to be hang'd for nonsense is the devil:
5888,DERRICK.,"Hadst thou the glories of thy king express'd,                      500"
5889,DERRICK.,Thy praises had been satire at the best;
5890,DERRICK.,"But thou in clumsy verse, unlick'd, unpointed,"
5891,DERRICK.,Hast shamefully defied the Lord's anointed:
5892,DERRICK.,"I will not rake the dunghill for thy crimes,"
5893,DERRICK.,For who would read thy life that reads thy rhymes?
5894,DERRICK.,"But of king David's foes, be this the doom,"
5895,DERRICK.,May all be like the young man Absalom;
5896,DERRICK.,"And, for my foes, may this their blessing be,"
5897,DERRICK.,"To talk like Doeg, and to write like thee!"
5898,DERRICK.,
5899,DERRICK.,"Achitophel, each rank, degree, and age,                           510"
5900,DERRICK.,For various ends neglects not to engage;
5901,DERRICK.,"The wise and rich, for purse and counsel brought,"
5902,DERRICK.,"The fools and beggars, for their number sought:"
5903,DERRICK.,"Who yet not only on the town depends,"
5904,DERRICK.,For even in court the faction had its friends;
5905,DERRICK.,"These thought the places they possess'd too small,"
5906,DERRICK.,And in their hearts wish'd court and king to fall:
5907,DERRICK.,"Whose names the muse disdaining, holds i' the dark,"
5908,DERRICK.,Thrust in the villain herd without a mark;
5909,DERRICK.,"With parasites and libel-spawning imps,                            520"
5910,DERRICK.,"Intriguing fops, dull jesters, and worse pimps."
5911,DERRICK.,"Disdain the rascal rabble to pursue,"
5912,DERRICK.,Their set cabals are yet a viler crew:
5913,DERRICK.,"See where, involved in common smoke, they sit;"
5914,DERRICK.,"Some for our mirth, some for our satire fit:"
5915,DERRICK.,"These, gloomy, thoughtful, and on mischief bent,"
5916,DERRICK.,"While those, for mere good-fellowship, frequent"
5917,DERRICK.,"The appointed club, can let sedition pass,"
5918,DERRICK.,"Sense, nonsense, anything to employ the glass;"
5919,DERRICK.,"And who believe, in their dull honest hearts,                      530"
5920,DERRICK.,The rest talk reason but to show their parts;
5921,DERRICK.,"Who ne'er had wit or will for mischief yet,"
5922,DERRICK.,But pleased to be reputed of a set.
5923,DERRICK.,
5924,DERRICK.,"But in the sacred annals of our plot,"
5925,DERRICK.,Industrious Arod never be forgot:
5926,DERRICK.,"The labours of this midnight-magistrate,"
5927,DERRICK.,May vie with Corah's to preserve the state.
5928,DERRICK.,"In search of arms, he fail'd not to lay hold"
5929,DERRICK.,"On war's most powerful, dangerous weapon--gold."
5930,DERRICK.,"And last, to take from Jebusites all odds,                         540"
5931,DERRICK.,"Their altars pillaged, stole their very gods;"
5932,DERRICK.,"Oft would he cry, when treasure he surprised,"
5933,DERRICK.,'Tis Baalish gold in David's coin disguised;
5934,DERRICK.,"Which to his house with richer relics came,"
5935,DERRICK.,While lumber idols only fed the flame:
5936,DERRICK.,"For our wise rabble ne'er took pains to inquire,"
5937,DERRICK.,"What 'twas he burnt, so 't made a rousing fire."
5938,DERRICK.,With which our elder was enrich'd no more
5939,DERRICK.,Than false Gehazi with the Syrian's store;
5940,DERRICK.,"So poor, that when our choosing-tribes were met,                   550"
5941,DERRICK.,Even for his stinking votes he ran in debt;
5942,DERRICK.,"For meat the wicked, and, as authors think,"
5943,DERRICK.,The saints he choused for his electing drink;
5944,DERRICK.,"Thus every shift and subtle method past,"
5945,DERRICK.,And all to be no Zaken at the last.
5946,DERRICK.,
5947,DERRICK.,"Now, raised on Tyre's sad ruins, Pharaoh's pride"
5948,DERRICK.,"Soar'd high, his legions threatening far and wide;"
5949,DERRICK.,"As when a battering storm engender'd high,"
5950,DERRICK.,"By winds upheld, hangs hovering in the sky,"
5951,DERRICK.,Is gazed upon by every trembling swain--                           560
5952,DERRICK.,"This for his vineyard fears, and that, his grain;"
5953,DERRICK.,"For blooming plants, and flowers new opening these,"
5954,DERRICK.,"For lambs yean'd lately, and far-labouring bees:"
5955,DERRICK.,"To guard his stock each to the gods does call,"
5956,DERRICK.,Uncertain where the fire-charged clouds will fall:
5957,DERRICK.,"Even so the doubtful nations watch his arms,"
5958,DERRICK.,With terror each expecting his alarms.
5959,DERRICK.,"Where, Judah! where was now thy lion's roar?"
5960,DERRICK.,Thou only couldst the captive lands restore;
5961,DERRICK.,"But thou, with inbred broils and faction press'd,                  570"
5962,DERRICK.,From Egypt needst a guardian with the rest.
5963,DERRICK.,"Thy prince from Sanhedrims no trust allow'd,"
5964,DERRICK.,"Too much the representers of the crowd,"
5965,DERRICK.,"Who for their own defence give no supply,"
5966,DERRICK.,But what the crown's prerogatives must buy:
5967,DERRICK.,As if their monarch's rights to violate
5968,DERRICK.,"More needful were, than to preserve the state!"
5969,DERRICK.,"From present dangers they divert their care,"
5970,DERRICK.,And all their fears are of the royal heir;
5971,DERRICK.,Whom now the reigning malice of his foes                           580
5972,DERRICK.,"Unjudged would sentence, and e'er crown'd depose."
5973,DERRICK.,"Religion the pretence, but their decree"
5974,DERRICK.,"To bar his reign, whate'er his faith shall be!"
5975,DERRICK.,"By Sanhedrims and clamorous crowds thus press'd,"
5976,DERRICK.,What passions rent the righteous David's breast!
5977,DERRICK.,Who knows not how to oppose or to comply--
5978,DERRICK.,"Unjust to grant, or dangerous to deny!"
5979,DERRICK.,"How near, in this dark juncture, Israel's fate,"
5980,DERRICK.,"Whose peace one sole expedient could create,"
5981,DERRICK.,"Which yet the extremest virtue did require,                        590"
5982,DERRICK.,Even of that prince whose downfall they conspire!
5983,DERRICK.,"His absence David does with tears advise,"
5984,DERRICK.,To appease their rage. Undaunted he complies.
5985,DERRICK.,"Thus he, who, prodigal of blood and ease,"
5986,DERRICK.,"A royal life exposed to winds and seas,"
5987,DERRICK.,"At once contending with the waves and fire,"
5988,DERRICK.,"And heading danger in the wars of Tyre,"
5989,DERRICK.,"Inglorious now forsakes his native sand,"
5990,DERRICK.,And like an exile quits the promised land!
5991,DERRICK.,"Our monarch scarce from pressing tears refrains,                   600"
5992,DERRICK.,"And painfully his royal state maintains,"
5993,DERRICK.,"Who now, embracing on the extremest shore,"
5994,DERRICK.,Almost revokes what he enjoin'd before:
5995,DERRICK.,Concludes at last more trust to be allow'd
5996,DERRICK.,To storms and seas than to the raging crowd!
5997,DERRICK.,"Forbear, rash muse! the parting scene to draw,"
5998,DERRICK.,With silence charm'd as deep as theirs that saw!
5999,DERRICK.,"Not only our attending nobles weep,"
6000,DERRICK.,But hardy sailors swell with tears the deep!
6001,DERRICK.,"The tide restrain'd her course, and more amazed,                   610"
6002,DERRICK.,The twin-stars on the royal brothers gazed:
6003,DERRICK.,While this sole fear--
6004,DERRICK.,"Does trouble to our suffering hero bring,"
6005,DERRICK.,Lest next the popular rage oppress the king!
6006,DERRICK.,"Thus parting, each for the other's danger grieved,"
6007,DERRICK.,"The shore the king, and seas the prince received."
6008,DERRICK.,"Go, injured hero! while propitious gales,"
6009,DERRICK.,"Soft as thy consort's breath, inspire thy sails;"
6010,DERRICK.,"Well may she trust her beauties on a flood,"
6011,DERRICK.,Where thy triumphant fleets so oft have rode!                      620
6012,DERRICK.,"Safe on thy breast reclined, her rest be deep,"
6013,DERRICK.,Rock'd like a Nereid by the waves asleep;
6014,DERRICK.,"While happiest dreams her fancy entertain,"
6015,DERRICK.,And to Elysian fields convert the main!
6016,DERRICK.,"Go, injured hero! while the shores of Tyre"
6017,DERRICK.,"At thy approach so silent shall admire,"
6018,DERRICK.,"Who on thy thunder still their thoughts employ,"
6019,DERRICK.,And greet thy landing with a trembling joy!
6020,DERRICK.,
6021,DERRICK.,"On heroes thus the prophet's fate is thrown,"
6022,DERRICK.,Admired by every nation but their own;                             630
6023,DERRICK.,"Yet while our factious Jews his worth deny,"
6024,DERRICK.,Their aching conscience gives their tongue the lie.
6025,DERRICK.,Even in the worst of men the noblest parts
6026,DERRICK.,"Confess him, and he triumphs in their hearts,"
6027,DERRICK.,Whom to his king the best respects commend
6028,DERRICK.,"Of subject, soldier, kinsman, prince, and friend;"
6029,DERRICK.,"All sacred names of most divine esteem,"
6030,DERRICK.,And to perfection all sustain'd by him;
6031,DERRICK.,"Wise, just, and constant, courtly without art,"
6032,DERRICK.,Swift to discern and to reward desert;                             640
6033,DERRICK.,"No hour of his in fruitless ease destroy'd,"
6034,DERRICK.,But on the noblest subjects still employ'd:
6035,DERRICK.,Whose steady soul ne'er learn'd to separate
6036,DERRICK.,Between his monarch's interest and the state;
6037,DERRICK.,"But heaps those blessings on the royal head,"
6038,DERRICK.,Which he well knows must be on subjects shed.
6039,DERRICK.,
6040,DERRICK.,On what pretence could then the vulgar rage
6041,DERRICK.,Against his worth and native rights engage?
6042,DERRICK.,Religious fears their argument are made--
6043,DERRICK.,Religious fears his sacred rights invade!                          650
6044,DERRICK.,"Of future superstition they complain,"
6045,DERRICK.,And Jebusitic worship in his reign:
6046,DERRICK.,"With such alarms his foes the crowd deceive,"
6047,DERRICK.,"With dangers fright, which not themselves believe."
6048,DERRICK.,
6049,DERRICK.,"Since nothing can our sacred rites remove,"
6050,DERRICK.,Whate'er the faith of the successor prove:
6051,DERRICK.,"Our Jews their ark shall undisturb'd retain,"
6052,DERRICK.,"At least while their religion is their gain,"
6053,DERRICK.,Who know by old experience Baal's commands
6054,DERRICK.,"Not only claim'd their conscience, but their lands;                660"
6055,DERRICK.,"They grudge God's tithes, how therefore shall they yield"
6056,DERRICK.,An idol full possession of the field?
6057,DERRICK.,"Grant such a prince enthroned, we must confess"
6058,DERRICK.,"The people's sufferings than that monarch's less,"
6059,DERRICK.,"Who must to hard conditions still be bound,"
6060,DERRICK.,And for his quiet with the crowd compound;
6061,DERRICK.,"Or should his thoughts to tyranny incline,"
6062,DERRICK.,Where are the means to compass the design?
6063,DERRICK.,"Our crown's revenues are too short a store,"
6064,DERRICK.,And jealous Sanhedrims would give no more.                         670
6065,DERRICK.,
6066,DERRICK.,"As vain our fears of Egypt's potent aid,"
6067,DERRICK.,"Not so has Pharaoh learn'd ambition's trade,"
6068,DERRICK.,"Nor ever with such measures can comply,"
6069,DERRICK.,As shock the common rules of policy;
6070,DERRICK.,"None dread like him the growth of Israel's king,"
6071,DERRICK.,And he alone sufficient aids can bring;
6072,DERRICK.,"Who knows that prince to Egypt can give law,"
6073,DERRICK.,That on our stubborn tribes his yoke could draw:
6074,DERRICK.,"At such profound expense he has not stood,"
6075,DERRICK.,Nor dyed for this his hands so deep in blood;                      680
6076,DERRICK.,"Would ne'er through wrong and right his progress take,"
6077,DERRICK.,"Grudge his own rest, and keep the world awake,"
6078,DERRICK.,"To fix a lawless prince on Judah's throne,"
6079,DERRICK.,"First to invade our rights, and then his own;"
6080,DERRICK.,"His dear-gain'd conquests cheaply to despoil,"
6081,DERRICK.,And reap the harvest of his crimes and toil.
6082,DERRICK.,"We grant his wealth vast as our ocean's sand,"
6083,DERRICK.,"And curse its fatal influence on our land,"
6084,DERRICK.,"Which our bribed Jews so numerously partake,"
6085,DERRICK.,That even an host his pensioners would make.                       690
6086,DERRICK.,"From these deceivers our divisions spring,"
6087,DERRICK.,"Our weakness, and the growth of Egypt's king;"
6088,DERRICK.,"These, with pretended friendship to the state,"
6089,DERRICK.,Our crowds' suspicion of their prince create;
6090,DERRICK.,"Both pleased and frighten'd with the specious cry,"
6091,DERRICK.,To guard their sacred rites and property.
6092,DERRICK.,"To ruin thus the chosen flock are sold,"
6093,DERRICK.,While wolves are ta'en for guardians of the fold;
6094,DERRICK.,"Seduced by these, we groundlessly complain,"
6095,DERRICK.,And loathe the manna of a gentle reign:                            700
6096,DERRICK.,Thus our forefathers' crooked paths are trod--
6097,DERRICK.,We trust our prince no more than they their God.
6098,DERRICK.,"But all in vain our reasoning prophets preach,"
6099,DERRICK.,"To those whom sad experience ne'er could teach,"
6100,DERRICK.,"Who can commence new broils in bleeding scars,"
6101,DERRICK.,And fresh remembrance of intestine wars;
6102,DERRICK.,"When the same household mortal foes did yield,"
6103,DERRICK.,And brothers stain'd with brothers' blood the field;
6104,DERRICK.,"When sons' cursed steel the fathers' gore did stain,"
6105,DERRICK.,And mothers mourn'd for sons by fathers slain!                     710
6106,DERRICK.,"When thick as Egypt's locusts on the sand,"
6107,DERRICK.,"Our tribes lay slaughter'd through the promised land,"
6108,DERRICK.,"Whose few survivors with worse fate remain,"
6109,DERRICK.,To drag the bondage of a tyrant's reign:
6110,DERRICK.,"Which scene of woes, unknowing we renew,"
6111,DERRICK.,"And madly, even those ills we fear, pursue;"
6112,DERRICK.,"While Pharaoh laughs at our domestic broils,"
6113,DERRICK.,And safely crowds his tents with nations' spoils.
6114,DERRICK.,"Yet our fierce Sanhedrim, in restless rage,"
6115,DERRICK.,"Against our absent hero still engage,                              720"
6116,DERRICK.,"And chiefly urge, such did their frenzy prove,"
6117,DERRICK.,"The only suit their prince forbids to move,"
6118,DERRICK.,"Which, till obtain'd, they cease affairs of state,"
6119,DERRICK.,And real dangers waive for groundless hate.
6120,DERRICK.,"Long David's patience waits relief to bring,"
6121,DERRICK.,"With all the indulgence of a lawful king,"
6122,DERRICK.,"Expecting still the troubled waves would cease,"
6123,DERRICK.,But found the raging billows still increase.
6124,DERRICK.,"The crowd, whose insolence forbearance swells,"
6125,DERRICK.,"While he forgives too far, almost rebels.                          730"
6126,DERRICK.,"At last his deep resentments silence broke,"
6127,DERRICK.,"The imperial palace shook, while thus he spoke--"
6128,DERRICK.,
6129,DERRICK.,"Then Justice wait, and Rigour take her time,"
6130,DERRICK.,For lo! our mercy is become our crime:
6131,DERRICK.,"While halting Punishment her stroke delays,"
6132,DERRICK.,"Our sovereign right, Heaven's sacred trust, decays!"
6133,DERRICK.,"For whose support even subjects' interest calls,"
6134,DERRICK.,Woe to that kingdom where the monarch falls!
6135,DERRICK.,"That prince who yields the least of regal sway,"
6136,DERRICK.,So far his people's freedom does betray.                           740
6137,DERRICK.,"Right lives by law, and law subsists by power;"
6138,DERRICK.,"Disarm the shepherd, wolves the flock devour."
6139,DERRICK.,"Hard lot of empire o'er a stubborn race,"
6140,DERRICK.,Which Heaven itself in vain has tried with grace!
6141,DERRICK.,"When will our reason's long-charm'd eyes unclose,"
6142,DERRICK.,And Israel judge between her friends and foes?
6143,DERRICK.,"When shall we see expired deceivers' sway,"
6144,DERRICK.,And credit what our God and monarchs say?
6145,DERRICK.,"Dissembled patriots, bribed with Egypt's gold,"
6146,DERRICK.,Even Sanhedrims in blind obedience hold;                           750
6147,DERRICK.,"Those patriots falsehood in their actions see,"
6148,DERRICK.,And judge by the pernicious fruit the tree.
6149,DERRICK.,"If aught for which so loudly they declaim,"
6150,DERRICK.,"Religion, laws, and freedom, were their aim,"
6151,DERRICK.,"Our senates in due methods they had led,"
6152,DERRICK.,To avoid those mischiefs which they seem'd to dread:
6153,DERRICK.,"But first, e'er yet they propp'd the sinking state,"
6154,DERRICK.,"To impeach and charge, as urged by private hate,"
6155,DERRICK.,"Proves that they ne'er believed the fears they press'd,"
6156,DERRICK.,But barbarously destroy'd the nation's rest!                       760
6157,DERRICK.,"Oh! whither will ungovern'd senates drive,"
6158,DERRICK.,And to what bounds licentious votes arrive?
6159,DERRICK.,"When their injustice we are press'd to share,"
6160,DERRICK.,The monarch urged to exclude the lawful heir;
6161,DERRICK.,"Are princes thus distinguish'd from the crowd,"
6162,DERRICK.,And this the privilege of royal blood?
6163,DERRICK.,"But grant we should confirm the wrongs they press,"
6164,DERRICK.,His sufferings yet were than the people's less;
6165,DERRICK.,"Condemn'd for life the murdering sword to wield,"
6166,DERRICK.,And on their heirs entail a bloody field.                          770
6167,DERRICK.,"Thus madly their own freedom they betray,"
6168,DERRICK.,And for the oppression which they fear make way;
6169,DERRICK.,"Succession fix'd by Heaven, the kingdom's bar,"
6170,DERRICK.,"Which once dissolved, admits the flood of war;"
6171,DERRICK.,"Waste, rapine, spoil, without the assault begin,"
6172,DERRICK.,And our mad tribes supplant the fence within.
6173,DERRICK.,"Since then their good they will not understand,"
6174,DERRICK.,'Tis time to take the monarch's power in hand;
6175,DERRICK.,"Authority and force to join with skill,"
6176,DERRICK.,And save the lunatics against their will.                          780
6177,DERRICK.,"The same rough means that 'suage the crowd, appease"
6178,DERRICK.,Our senates raging with the crowd's disease.
6179,DERRICK.,Henceforth unbiass'd measures let them draw
6180,DERRICK.,"From no false gloss, but genuine text of law;"
6181,DERRICK.,"Nor urge those crimes upon religion's score,"
6182,DERRICK.,Themselves so much in Jebusites abhor.
6183,DERRICK.,"Whom laws convict, and only they, shall bleed,"
6184,DERRICK.,Nor pharisees by pharisees be freed.
6185,DERRICK.,"Impartial justice from our throne shall shower,"
6186,DERRICK.,"All shall have right, and we our sovereign power.                  790"
6187,DERRICK.,
6188,DERRICK.,"He said, the attendants heard with awful joy,"
6189,DERRICK.,And glad presages their fix'd thoughts employ;
6190,DERRICK.,"From Hebron now the suffering heir return'd,"
6191,DERRICK.,A realm that long with civil discord mourn'd;
6192,DERRICK.,"Till his approach, like some arriving God,"
6193,DERRICK.,Composed and heal'd the place of his abode;
6194,DERRICK.,"The deluge check'd that to Judea spread,"
6195,DERRICK.,And stopp'd sedition at the fountain's head.
6196,DERRICK.,"Thus, in forgiving, David's paths he drives,"
6197,DERRICK.,"And, chased from Israel, Israel's peace contrives.                 800"
6198,DERRICK.,"The field confess'd his power in arms before,"
6199,DERRICK.,And seas proclaim'd his triumphs to the shore;
6200,DERRICK.,"As nobly has his sway in Hebron shown,"
6201,DERRICK.,How fit to inherit godlike David's throne.
6202,DERRICK.,"Through Sion's streets his glad arrival's spread,"
6203,DERRICK.,And conscious faction shrinks her snaky head;
6204,DERRICK.,His train their sufferings think o'erpaid to see
6205,DERRICK.,The crowd's applause with virtue once agree.
6206,DERRICK.,"Success charms all, but zeal for worth distress'd,"
6207,DERRICK.,A virtue proper to the brave and best;                             810
6208,DERRICK.,'Mongst whom was Jothran--Jothran always bent
6209,DERRICK.,"To serve the crown, and loyal by descent;"
6210,DERRICK.,"Whose constancy so firm, and conduct just,"
6211,DERRICK.,Deserved at once two royal masters' trust;
6212,DERRICK.,Who Tyre's proud arms had manfully withstood
6213,DERRICK.,"On seas, and gather'd laurels from the flood;"
6214,DERRICK.,"Of learning yet no portion was denied,"
6215,DERRICK.,Friend to the Muses and the Muses' pride.
6216,DERRICK.,"Nor can Benaiah's worth forgotten lie,"
6217,DERRICK.,Of steady soul when public storms were high;                       820
6218,DERRICK.,"Whose conduct, while the Moor fierce onsets made,"
6219,DERRICK.,Secured at once our honour and our trade.
6220,DERRICK.,"Such were the chiefs who most his sufferings mourn'd,"
6221,DERRICK.,And view'd with silent joy the prince return'd;
6222,DERRICK.,"While those that sought his absence to betray,"
6223,DERRICK.,Press first their nauseous false respects to pay;
6224,DERRICK.,"Him still the officious hypocrites molest,"
6225,DERRICK.,And with malicious duty break his rest.
6226,DERRICK.,
6227,DERRICK.,"While real transports thus his friends employ,"
6228,DERRICK.,"And foes are loud in their dissembled joy,                         830"
6229,DERRICK.,"His triumphs, so resounded far and near,"
6230,DERRICK.,Miss'd not his young ambitious rival's ear;
6231,DERRICK.,"And as when joyful hunters' clamorous train,"
6232,DERRICK.,"Some slumbering lion wakes in Moab's plain,"
6233,DERRICK.,"Who oft had forced the bold assailants yield,"
6234,DERRICK.,"And scatter'd his pursuers through the field,"
6235,DERRICK.,"Disdaining, furls his mane and tears the ground,"
6236,DERRICK.,"His eyes inflaming all the desert round,"
6237,DERRICK.,"With roar of seas directs his chasers' way,"
6238,DERRICK.,"Provokes from far, and dares them to the fray:                     840"
6239,DERRICK.,"Such rage storm'd now in Absalom's fierce breast,"
6240,DERRICK.,Such indignation his fired eyes confess'd.
6241,DERRICK.,Where now was the instructor of his pride?
6242,DERRICK.,"Slept the old pilot in so rough a tide,"
6243,DERRICK.,"Whose wiles had from the happy shore betray'd,"
6244,DERRICK.,And thus on shelves the credulous youth convey'd?
6245,DERRICK.,"In deep revolving thoughts he weighs his state,"
6246,DERRICK.,"Secure of craft, nor doubts to baffle fate;"
6247,DERRICK.,"At least, if his storm'd bark must go adrift,"
6248,DERRICK.,"To balk his charge, and for himself to shift,                      850"
6249,DERRICK.,"In which his dexterous wit had oft been shown,"
6250,DERRICK.,And in the wreck of kingdoms saved his own.
6251,DERRICK.,"But now, with more than common danger press'd,"
6252,DERRICK.,"Of various resolutions stands possess'd,"
6253,DERRICK.,Perceives the crowd's unstable zeal decay
6254,DERRICK.,"Lest their recanting chief the cause betray,"
6255,DERRICK.,"Who on a father's grace his hopes may ground,"
6256,DERRICK.,And for his pardon with their heads compound.
6257,DERRICK.,"Him therefore, e'er his fortune slip her time."
6258,DERRICK.,The statesman plots to engage in some bold crime                   860
6259,DERRICK.,"Past pardon--whether to attempt his bed,"
6260,DERRICK.,"Or threat with open arms the royal head,"
6261,DERRICK.,"Or other daring method, and unjust,"
6262,DERRICK.,That may confirm him in the people's trust.
6263,DERRICK.,"But failing thus to ensnare him, nor secure"
6264,DERRICK.,"How long his foil'd ambition may endure,"
6265,DERRICK.,"Plots next to lay him by as past his date,"
6266,DERRICK.,And try some new pretender's luckier fate;
6267,DERRICK.,"Whose hopes with equal toil he would pursue,"
6268,DERRICK.,"Nor care what claimer's crown'd, except the true.                  870"
6269,DERRICK.,"Wake, Absalom! approaching ruin shun,"
6270,DERRICK.,"And see, O see, for whom thou art undone!"
6271,DERRICK.,"How are thy honours and thy fame betray'd,"
6272,DERRICK.,The property of desperate villains made!
6273,DERRICK.,"Lost power and conscious fears their crimes create,"
6274,DERRICK.,And guilt in them was little less than fate;
6275,DERRICK.,"But why shouldst thou, from every grievance free,"
6276,DERRICK.,Forsake thy vineyards for their stormy sea?
6277,DERRICK.,"For thee did Canaan's milk and honey flow,"
6278,DERRICK.,"Love dress'd thy bowers, and laurels sought thy brow;              880"
6279,DERRICK.,"Preferment, wealth, and power thy vassals were,"
6280,DERRICK.,And of a monarch all things but the care.
6281,DERRICK.,"Oh! should our crimes again that curse draw down,"
6282,DERRICK.,"And rebel-arms once more attempt the crown,"
6283,DERRICK.,"Sure ruin waits unhappy Absalom,"
6284,DERRICK.,Alike by conquest or defeat undone.
6285,DERRICK.,Who could relentless see such youth and charms
6286,DERRICK.,Expire with wretched fate in impious arms?
6287,DERRICK.,"A prince so form'd, with earth's and Heaven's applause,"
6288,DERRICK.,To triumph o'er crown'd heads in David's cause:                    890
6289,DERRICK.,"Or grant him victor, still his hopes must fail,"
6290,DERRICK.,"Who, conquering, would not for himself prevail;"
6291,DERRICK.,"The faction whom he trusts for future sway,"
6292,DERRICK.,Him and the public would alike betray;
6293,DERRICK.,"Amongst themselves divide the captive state,"
6294,DERRICK.,And found their hydra-empire in his fate!
6295,DERRICK.,"Thus having beat the clouds with painful flight,"
6296,DERRICK.,"The pitied youth, with sceptres in his sight"
6297,DERRICK.,"(So have their cruel politics decreed),"
6298,DERRICK.,"Must by that crew, that made him guilty, bleed!                    900"
6299,DERRICK.,"For, could their pride brook any prince's sway,"
6300,DERRICK.,Whom but mild David would they choose to obey?
6301,DERRICK.,"Who once at such a gentle reign repine,"
6302,DERRICK.,The fall of monarchy itself design:
6303,DERRICK.,"From hate to that their reformations spring,"
6304,DERRICK.,"And David not their grievance, but the king."
6305,DERRICK.,"Seized now with panic fear the faction lies,"
6306,DERRICK.,"Lest this clear truth strike Absalom's charm'd eyes,"
6307,DERRICK.,"Lest he perceive, from long enchantment free,"
6308,DERRICK.,What all beside the flatter'd youth must see:                      910
6309,DERRICK.,"But whate'er doubts his troubled bosom swell,"
6310,DERRICK.,"Fair carriage still became Achitophel,"
6311,DERRICK.,"Who now an envious festival installs,"
6312,DERRICK.,"And to survey their strength the faction calls,--"
6313,DERRICK.,"Which fraud, religious worship too must gild."
6314,DERRICK.,But oh! how weakly does sedition build!
6315,DERRICK.,"For lo! the royal mandate issues forth,"
6316,DERRICK.,"Dashing at once their treason, zeal, and mirth!"
6317,DERRICK.,"So have I seen disastrous chance invade,"
6318,DERRICK.,"Where careful emmets had their forage laid,                        920"
6319,DERRICK.,Whether fierce Vulcan's rage the furzy plain
6320,DERRICK.,"Had seized, engender'd by some careless swain;"
6321,DERRICK.,"Or swelling Neptune lawless inroads made,"
6322,DERRICK.,And to their cell of store his flood convey'd;
6323,DERRICK.,"The commonwealth broke up, distracted go,"
6324,DERRICK.,And in wild haste their loaded mates o'erthrow:
6325,DERRICK.,"Even so our scatter'd guests confusedly meet,"
6326,DERRICK.,"With boil'd, baked, roast, all justling in the street;"
6327,DERRICK.,"Dejecting all, and ruefully dismay'd,"
6328,DERRICK.,For shekel without treat or treason paid.                          930
6329,DERRICK.,"Sedition's dark eclipse now fainter shows,"
6330,DERRICK.,"More bright each hour the royal planet grows,"
6331,DERRICK.,"Of force the clouds of envy to disperse,"
6332,DERRICK.,In kind conjunction of assisting stars.
6333,DERRICK.,"Here, labouring muse! those glorious chiefs relate,"
6334,DERRICK.,That turn'd the doubtful scale of David's fate;
6335,DERRICK.,"The rest of that illustrious band rehearse,"
6336,DERRICK.,Immortalized in laurell'd Asaph's verse:
6337,DERRICK.,"Hard task! yet will not I thy flight recall,"
6338,DERRICK.,"View heaven, and then enjoy thy glorious fall.                     940"
6339,DERRICK.,
6340,DERRICK.,"First write Bezaliel, whose illustrious name"
6341,DERRICK.,"Forestalls our praise, and gives his poet fame."
6342,DERRICK.,"The Kenites' rocky province his command,"
6343,DERRICK.,A barren limb of fertile Canaan's land;
6344,DERRICK.,Which for its generous natives yet could be
6345,DERRICK.,Held worthy such a president as he.
6346,DERRICK.,"Bezaliel, with each grace and virtue fraught,"
6347,DERRICK.,"Serene his looks, serene his life and thought;"
6348,DERRICK.,"On whom so largely nature heap'd her store,"
6349,DERRICK.,There scarce remain'd for arts to give him more!                   950
6350,DERRICK.,"To aid the crown and state his greatest zeal,"
6351,DERRICK.,His second care that service to conceal;
6352,DERRICK.,"Of dues observant, firm to every trust,"
6353,DERRICK.,And to the needy always more than just;
6354,DERRICK.,"Who truth from specious falsehood can divide,"
6355,DERRICK.,Has all the gownsmen's skill without their pride.
6356,DERRICK.,"Thus crown'd with worth, from heights of honour won,"
6357,DERRICK.,"Sees all his glories copied in his son,"
6358,DERRICK.,Whose forward fame should every muse engage--
6359,DERRICK.,Whose youth boasts skill denied to others' age.                    960
6360,DERRICK.,"Men, manners, language, books of noblest kind,"
6361,DERRICK.,Already are the conquest of his mind;
6362,DERRICK.,"Whose loyalty before its date was prime,"
6363,DERRICK.,Nor waited the dull course of rolling time:
6364,DERRICK.,"The monster faction early he dismay'd,"
6365,DERRICK.,And David's cause long since confess'd his aid.
6366,DERRICK.,
6367,DERRICK.,Brave Abdael o'er the prophet's school was placed--
6368,DERRICK.,Abdael with all his father's virtue graced;
6369,DERRICK.,"A hero who, while stars look'd wondering down,"
6370,DERRICK.,Without one Hebrew's blood restored the crown.                     970
6371,DERRICK.,That praise was his; what therefore did remain
6372,DERRICK.,"For following chiefs, but boldly to maintain"
6373,DERRICK.,"That crown restored? and in this rank of fame,"
6374,DERRICK.,Brave Abdael with the first a place must claim.
6375,DERRICK.,"Proceed, illustrious, happy chief! proceed,"

6385,DERRICK.,
6386,DERRICK.,"Eliab our next labour does invite,"
6387,DERRICK.,And hard the task to do Eliab right.

6389,DERRICK.,And firm in all the turns of fortune proved.
6390,DERRICK.,Such ancient service and desert so large
6391,DERRICK.,Well claim'd the royal household for his charge.                   990
6392,DERRICK.,"His age with only one mild heiress bless'd,"
6393,DERRICK.,"In all the bloom of smiling nature dress'd,"

6405,DERRICK.,"Even envy must consent to Helon's worth,"
6406,DERRICK.,"Whose soul, though Egypt glories in his birth,"

6408,DERRICK.,And Pharaoh's altars in their pomp disdain:
6409,DERRICK.,"To slight his gods was small; with nobler pride,"
6410,DERRICK.,He all the allurements of his court defied;
6411,DERRICK.,"Whom profit nor example could betray,"
6412,DERRICK.,"But Israel's friend, and true to David's sway.                    1010"
6413,DERRICK.,What acts of favour in his province fall

6418,DERRICK.,"Who, with a loyalty that did excel,"
6419,DERRICK.,Brought all the endowments of Achitophel.
6420,DERRICK.,"Sincere was Amri, and not only knew,"
6421,DERRICK.,But Israel's sanctions into practice drew;
6422,DERRICK.,"Our laws, that did a boundless ocean seem,"

6432,DERRICK.,For which his youth with danger did engage.
6433,DERRICK.,In vain our factious priests the cant revive;
6434,DERRICK.,In vain seditious scribes with libel strive                       1030

6436,DERRICK.,"Observes, and shoots their treasons as they fly;"
6437,DERRICK.,Their weekly frauds his keen replies detect;
6438,DERRICK.,He undeceives more fast than they infect:

6448,DERRICK.,
6449,DERRICK.,With wonder late posterity shall dwell

6455,DERRICK.,
6456,DERRICK.,"How fierce his satire loosed! restrain'd, how tame!"

6458,DERRICK.,"How well his worth, and brave adventures styled,"
6459,DERRICK.,"Just to his virtues, to his error mild!"

6461,DERRICK.,"But teems with just reproof, or praise as due;"
6462,DERRICK.,"Not Eden could a fairer prospect yield,"
6463,DERRICK.,All Paradise without one barren field:
6464,DERRICK.,Whose wit the censure of his foes has pass'd--
6465,DERRICK.,The song of Asaph shall for ever last.
6466,DERRICK.,
6467,DERRICK.,What praise for such rich strains shall we allow?
6468,DERRICK.,What just rewards the grateful crown bestow?                      1060
6469,DERRICK.,"While bees in flowers rejoice, and flowers in dew,"
6470,DERRICK.,While stars and fountains to their course are true;

6472,DERRICK.,The song of Asaph and the fame shall last!

6474,DERRICK.,"Still Hebron's honour'd, happy soil retains"
6475,DERRICK.,"Our royal hero's beauteous, dear remains;"
6476,DERRICK.,"Who now sails off with winds nor wishes slack,"
6477,DERRICK.,To bring his sufferings' bright companion back.
6478,DERRICK.,"But e'er such transport can our sense employ,"
6479,DERRICK.,A bitter grief must poison half our joy;                          1070
6480,DERRICK.,Nor can our coasts restored those blessings see
6481,DERRICK.,Without a bribe to envious destiny!
6482,DERRICK.,Cursed Sodom's doom for ever fix the tide
6483,DERRICK.,Where by inglorious chance the valiant died!
6484,DERRICK.,"Give not insulting Askelon to know,"
6485,DERRICK.,Nor let Gath's daughters triumph in our woe;
6486,DERRICK.,"No sailor with the news swell Egypt's pride,"
6487,DERRICK.,By what inglorious fate our valiant died.
6488,DERRICK.,"Weep, Arnon! Jordan, weep thy fountains dry!"
6489,DERRICK.,While Sion's rock dissolves for a supply.                         1080
6490,DERRICK.,
6491,DERRICK.,"Calm were the elements, night's silence deep,"
6492,DERRICK.,"The waves scarce murmuring, and the winds asleep;"
6493,DERRICK.,"Yet fate for ruin takes so still an hour,"
6494,DERRICK.,And treacherous sands the princely bark devour;
6495,DERRICK.,"Then death unworthy seized a generous race,"
6496,DERRICK.,"To virtue's scandal, and the stars' disgrace!"
6497,DERRICK.,"Oh! had the indulgent powers vouchsafed to yield,"
6498,DERRICK.,"Instead of faithless shelves, a listed field;"
6499,DERRICK.,"A listed field of Heaven's and David's foes,"
6500,DERRICK.,"Fierce as the troops that did his youth oppose,                   1090"
6501,DERRICK.,"Each life had on his slaughter'd heap retired,"
6502,DERRICK.,"Not tamely, and unconquering, thus expired:"
6503,DERRICK.,"But destiny is now their only foe,"
6504,DERRICK.,"And dying, even o'er that they triumph too;"
6505,DERRICK.,"With loud last breaths their master's 'scape applaud,"
6506,DERRICK.,Of whom kind force could scarce the fates defraud;
6507,DERRICK.,"Who for such followers lost, O matchless mind!"
6508,DERRICK.,At his own safety now almost repined!
6509,DERRICK.,"Say, royal Sir! by all your fame in arms,"
6510,DERRICK.,"Your praise in peace, and by Urania's charms,                     1100"
6511,DERRICK.,"If all your sufferings past so nearly press'd,"
6512,DERRICK.,Or pierced with half so painful grief your breast?
6513,DERRICK.,
6514,DERRICK.,"Thus some diviner muse her hero forms,"
6515,DERRICK.,"Not soothed with soft delights, but toss'd in storms;"
6516,DERRICK.,"Nor stretch'd on roses in the myrtle grove,"
6517,DERRICK.,"Nor crowns his days with mirth, his nights with love,"
6518,DERRICK.,"But far removed in thundering camps is found,"
6519,DERRICK.,"His slumbers short, his bed the herbless ground."
6520,DERRICK.,"In tasks of danger always seen the first,"
6521,DERRICK.,"Feeds from the hedge, and slakes with ice his thirst,             1110"
6522,DERRICK.,"Long must his patience strive with fortune's rage,"
6523,DERRICK.,And long-opposing gods themselves engage;
6524,DERRICK.,"Must see his country flame, his friends destroy'd,"
6525,DERRICK.,Before the promised empire be enjoy'd.
6526,DERRICK.,"Such toil of fate must build a man of fame,"
6527,DERRICK.,"And such, to Israel's crown, the godlike David came."
6528,DERRICK.,
6529,DERRICK.,"What sudden beams dispel the clouds so fast,"
6530,DERRICK.,Whose drenching rains laid all our vineyards waste?
6531,DERRICK.,"The spring, so far behind her course delay'd,"
6532,DERRICK.,On the instant is in all her bloom array'd;                       1120
6533,DERRICK.,"The winds breathe low, the element serene;"
6534,DERRICK.,Yet mark what motion in the waves is seen!
6535,DERRICK.,"Thronging and busy as Hyblaean swarms,"
6536,DERRICK.,"Or straggled soldiers summon'd to their arms,"
6537,DERRICK.,"See where the princely bark in loosest pride,"
6538,DERRICK.,"With all her guardian fleet, adorns the tide!"

6753,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,
6754,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,For to whom can I dedicate this poem with so much justice as to you? It
6755,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,is the representation of your own hero: it is the picture drawn at
6756,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"length, which you admire and prize so much in little. None of your"
6757,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"ornaments are wanting; neither the landscape of your Tower, nor the"
6758,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,rising sun; nor the Anno Domini of your new sovereign's coronation. This
6759,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,must needs be a grateful undertaking to your whole party; especially to
6760,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,those who have not been so happy as to purchase the original. I hear the
6761,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,graver has made a good market of it: all his kings are bought up
6762,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"already; or the value of the remainder so enhanced, that many a poor"
6763,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Polander, who would be glad to worship the image, is not able to go to"
6764,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"the cost of him, but must be content to see him here. I must confess I"
6765,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,am no great artist; but sign-post painting  will serve the turn to
6766,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"remember a friend by, especially when better is not to be had. Yet, for"
6767,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"your comfort, the lineaments are true; and though he sat not five times"
6768,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"to me, as he did to B., yet I have consulted history, as the Italian"
6769,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,painters do when they would draw a Nero or a Caligula: though they have
6770,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"not seen the man, they can help their imagination by a statue of him,"
6771,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"and find out the colouring from Suetonius and Tacitus. Truth is, you"
6772,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,might have spared one side of your Medal: the head would be seen to more
6773,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"advantage if it were placed on a spike of the Tower, a little nearer to"
6774,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"the sun, which would then break out to better purpose."
6775,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,
6776,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"You tell us in your preface to the ""No-Protestant Plot"",[77] that you"
6777,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,shall be forced hereafter to leave off your modesty: I suppose you mean
6778,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,that little which is left you; for it was worn to rags when you put out
6779,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,this Medal. Never was there practised such a piece of notorious
6780,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,impudence in the face of an established government. I believe when he is
6781,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"dead you will wear him in thumb rings, as the Turks did Scanderbeg; as"
6782,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,if there were virtue in his bones to preserve you against monarchy. Yet
6783,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"all this while you pretend not only zeal for the public good, but a due"
6784,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,veneration for the person of the king. But all men who can see an inch
6785,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"before them, may easily detect those gross fallacies. That it is"
6786,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"necessary for men in your circumstances to pretend both, is granted you;"
6787,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,for without them there could be no ground to raise a faction. But I
6788,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"would ask you one civil question, what right has any man among you, or"
6789,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"any association of men (to come nearer to you), who, out of parliament,"
6790,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"cannot be considered in a public capacity, to meet as you daily do in"
6791,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"factious clubs, to vilify the government in your discourses, and to"
6792,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,libel it in all your writings? Who made you judges in Israel? Or how is
6793,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"it consistent with your zeal for the public welfare, to promote"
6794,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"sedition? Does your definition of loyal, which is to serve the king"
6795,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"according to the laws, allow you the licence of traducing the executive"
6796,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,power with which you own he is invested? You complain that his majesty
6797,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,has lost the love and confidence of his people; and by your very urging
6798,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"it, you endeavour what in you lies to make him lose them. All good"
6799,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"subjects abhor the thought of arbitrary power, whether it be in one or"
6800,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"many: if you were the patriots you would seem, you would not at this"
6801,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"rate incense the multitude to assume it; for no sober man can fear it,"
6802,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"either from the king's disposition or his practice; or even, where you"
6803,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"would odiously lay it, from his ministers. Give us leave to enjoy the"
6804,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"government and the benefit of laws under which we were born, and which"
6805,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,we desire to transmit to our posterity. You are not the trustees of the
6806,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"public liberty; and if you have not right to petition in a crowd, much"
6807,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,less have you to intermeddle in the management of affairs; or to arraign
6808,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"what you do not like, which in effect is everything that is done by the"
6809,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,king and council. Can you imagine that any reasonable man will believe
6810,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"you respect the person of his majesty, when it is apparent that your"
6811,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,seditious pamphlets are stuffed with particular reflections on him? If
6812,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"you have the confidence to deny this, it is easy to be evinced from a"
6813,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"thousand passages, which I only forbear to quote, because I desire they"
6814,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,should die and be forgotten. I have perused many of your papers; and to
6815,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"show you that I have, the third part of your ""No-Protestant Plot"" is"
6816,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"much  of it stolen from your dead author's pamphlet, called the ""Growth"
6817,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"of Popery;"" as manifestly as Milton's ""Defence of the English People"" is"
6818,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"from Buchanan ""De jure regni apud Scotos:"" or your first Covenant and"
6819,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,new Association from the holy league of the French Guisards. Any one who
6820,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"reads Davila, may trace your practices all along. There were the same"
6821,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"pretences for reformation and loyalty, the same aspersions of the king,"
6822,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,and the same grounds of a rebellion. I know not whether you will take
6823,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"the historian's word, who says it was reported, that Poltrot, a"
6824,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Huguenot, murdered Francis Duke of Guise, by the instigations of"
6825,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Theodore Beza; or that it was a Huguenot minister, otherwise called a"
6826,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Presbyterian (for our church abhors so devilish a tenet), who first writ"
6827,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,a treatise of the lawfulness of deposing and murdering kings of a
6828,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"different persuasion in religion: but I am able to prove, from the"
6829,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"doctrine of Calvin, and principles of Buchanan, that they set the people"
6830,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"above the magistrate; which, if I mistake not, is your own fundamental,"
6831,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,and which carries your loyalty no further than your liking. When a vote
6832,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"of the House of Commons goes on your side, you are as ready to observe"
6833,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,it as if it were passed into a law; but when you are pinched with any
6834,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"former, and yet unrepealed act of parliament, you declare that in some"
6835,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,cases you will not be obliged by it. The passage is in the same third
6836,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"part of the ""No-Protestant Plot,"" and is too plain to be denied. The"
6837,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"late copy of your intended Association, you neither wholly justify nor"
6838,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"condemn; but as the Papists, when they are unopposed, fly out into all"
6839,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"the pageantries of worship, but in times of war, when they are hard"
6840,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"pressed by arguments, lie close intrenched behind the Council of Trent:"
6841,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"so now, when your affairs are in a low condition, you dare not pretend"
6842,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"that to be a legal combination, but whensoever you are afloat, I doubt"
6843,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"not but it will be maintained and justified to purpose. For, indeed,"
6844,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,there is nothing to defend it but the sword: it is the proper time to
6845,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,say anything when men have all things in their power.
6846,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,
6847,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"In the mean time, you would fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this"
6848,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Association, and that in the time of Queen Elizabeth.[78] But there is"
6849,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"this small difference betwixt them, that the ends of one are directly"
6850,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"opposite to the other: one with the queen's approbation and conjunction,"
6851,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"as head of it; the other, without either the consent or knowledge of the"
6852,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"king, against whose authority it is manifestly designed. Therefore you"
6853,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"do well to have recourse to your last evasion, that it was contrived by"
6854,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"your enemies, and shuffled into the papers that were seized; which yet"
6855,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,you see the nation is not so easy to believe as your own jury; but the
6856,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,matter is not difficult to find twelve men in Newgate who would acquit a
6857,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,malefactor.
6858,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,
6859,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"I have only one favour to desire of you at parting, that when you think"
6860,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"of answering this poem, you would employ the same pens against it, who"
6861,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,have combated with so much success against Absalom and Achitophel: for
6862,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"then you may assure yourselves of a clear victory, without the least"
6863,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"reply. Rail at me abundantly; and, not to break a custom, do it without"
6864,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"wit: by this method you will gain a considerable point, which is, wholly"
6865,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,to waive the answer of my arguments. Never own the bottom of your
6866,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"principles, for fear they should be treason. Fall severely on the"
6867,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"miscarriages of government; for if scandal be  not allowed, you are no"
6868,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,freeborn subjects. If God has not blessed you with the talent of
6869,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"rhyming, make use of my poor stock, and welcome: let your verses run"
6870,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"upon my feet; and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads, reduced"
6871,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"to the last extremity of sense, turn my own lines upon me, and, in utter"
6872,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"despair of your own satire, make me satirize myself. Some of you have"
6873,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"been driven to this bay already; but, above all the rest, commend me to"
6874,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"the nonconformist parson, who writ the ""Whip and Key."" I am afraid it is"
6875,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"not read so much as the piece deserves, because the bookseller is every"
6876,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"week crying help at the end of his Gazette, to get it off. You see I am"
6877,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"charitable enough to do him a kindness, that it may be published as well"
6878,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,as printed; and that so much skill in Hebrew derivations may not lie for
6879,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,waste-paper in the shop. Yet I half suspect he went no further for his
6880,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"learning, than the index of Hebrew names and etymologies, which is"
6881,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,printed at the end of some English Bibles. If Achitophel signifies the
6882,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"brother of a fool, the author of that poem will pass with his readers"
6883,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,for the next of kin. And perhaps it is the relation that makes the
6884,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"kindness. Whatever the verses are, buy them up, I beseech you, out of"
6885,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"pity; for I hear the conventicle is shut up, and the brother[79] of"
6886,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,Achitophel out of service.
6887,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,
6888,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Now, footmen, you know, have the generosity to make a purse for a member"
6889,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"of their society, who has had his livery pulled over his ears, and even"
6890,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"protestant socks are bought up among you, out of veneration to the name."
6891,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,A dissenter in poetry from sense and English will make as good a
6892,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Protestant rhymer, as a dissenter from the Church of England a"
6893,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"Protestant parson. Besides, if you encourage a young beginner, who knows"
6894,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,but he may elevate his style a little above the vulgar epithets of
6895,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"profane, and saucy jack, and atheistic scribbler, with which he treats"
6896,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"me, when the fit of enthusiasm is strong upon him: by which"
6897,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,well-mannered and charitable expressions I was certain of his sect
6898,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,before I knew his name. What would you have more of a man? He has damned
6899,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,me in your cause from Genesis to the Revelations; and has half the texts
6900,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"of both the Testaments against me, if you will be so civil to yourselves"
6901,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,as to take him for your interpreter; and not to take them for Irish
6902,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"witnesses. After all, perhaps you will tell me, that you retained him"
6903,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"only for the opening of your cause, and that your main lawyer is yet"
6904,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"behind. Now, if it so happen he meet with no more reply than his"
6905,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"predecessors, you may either conclude that I trust to the goodness of my"
6906,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"cause, or fear my adversary, or disdain him, or what you please; for the"
6907,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,"short of it is, it is indifferent to your humble servant, whatever your"
6908,EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS.,party says or thinks of him.

7298,THE PREFACE.,incompetent judges of sacred things; but in the due sense of my own
7299,THE PREFACE.,"weakness and want of learning, I plead not this: I pretend not to make"
7300,THE PREFACE.,"myself a judge of faith in others, but only to make a confession of my"
7301,THE PREFACE.,"own. I lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark, but wait on it, with the"
7302,THE PREFACE.,"reverence that becomes me, at a distance. In the next place, I will"
7303,THE PREFACE.,"ingenuously confess, that the helps I have used in this small treatise,"
7304,THE PREFACE.,were many of them taken from the works of our own reverend divines of
7305,THE PREFACE.,the Church of England: so that the weapons with which I combat
7306,THE PREFACE.,"irreligion, are already consecrated; though I suppose they may be taken"
7307,THE PREFACE.,"down as lawfully as the sword of Goliah was by David, when they are to"
7308,THE PREFACE.,be employed for the common cause against the enemies of piety. I intend
7309,THE PREFACE.,"not by this to entitle them to any of my errors, which yet I hope are"
7310,THE PREFACE.,only those of charity to mankind; and such as my own charity has caused
7311,THE PREFACE.,"me to commit, that of others may more easily excuse. Being naturally"
7312,THE PREFACE.,"inclined to scepticism in philosophy, I have no reason to impose my"
7313,THE PREFACE.,"opinions in a subject which is above it; but whatever they are, I submit"
7314,THE PREFACE.,"them with all reverence to my mother church, accounting them no farther"
7315,THE PREFACE.,"mine, than as they are authorised, or at least uncondemned by her. And,"
7316,THE PREFACE.,"indeed, to secure myself on this side, I have used the necessary"
7317,THE PREFACE.,"precaution of showing this paper, before it was published, to a"
7318,THE PREFACE.,"judicious and learned friend, a man indefatigably zealous in the service"
7319,THE PREFACE.,of the church and state; and whose writings have highly deserved of
7320,THE PREFACE.,"both. He was pleased to approve the body of the discourse, and I hope he"
7321,THE PREFACE.,is more my friend than to do it out of complaisance: it is true he had
7322,THE PREFACE.,too good a taste to like it all; and amongst some other faults
7323,THE PREFACE.,"recommended to my second view, what I have written perhaps too boldly on"
7324,THE PREFACE.,"St Athanasius, which he advised me wholly to omit. I am sensible enough"
7325,THE PREFACE.,that I had done more prudently to have followed his opinion: but then I
7326,THE PREFACE.,could not have satisfied myself that I had done honestly not to have
7327,THE PREFACE.,"written what was my own. It has always been my thought, that heathens"
7328,THE PREFACE.,"who never did, nor without miracle could, hear of the name of Christ,"
7329,THE PREFACE.,were yet in a possibility of salvation. Neither will it enter easily
7330,THE PREFACE.,"into my belief, that before the coming of our Saviour the whole world,"
7331,THE PREFACE.,"excepting only the Jewish nation, should lie under the inevitable"
7332,THE PREFACE.,"necessity of everlasting punishment, for want of that revelation, which"
7333,THE PREFACE.,was confined to so small a spot of ground as that of Palestine. Among
7334,THE PREFACE.,the sons of Noah we read of one only who was accursed; and if a blessing
7335,THE PREFACE.,in the ripeness of time was reserved for Japhet (of whose progeny we
7336,THE PREFACE.,"are), it seems unaccountable to me, why so many generations of the same"
7337,THE PREFACE.,"offspring, as preceded our Saviour in the flesh, should be all involved"
7338,THE PREFACE.,"in one common condemnation, and yet that their posterity should be"
7339,THE PREFACE.,entitled to the hopes of salvation: as if a bill of exclusion had passed
7340,THE PREFACE.,"only on the fathers, which debarred not the sons from their succession:"
7341,THE PREFACE.,"or that so many ages had been delivered over to hell, and so many"
7342,THE PREFACE.,"reserved for heaven; and that the devil had the first choice, and God"
7343,THE PREFACE.,"the next. Truly I am apt to think, that the revealed religion which was"
7344,THE PREFACE.,"taught by Noah to all his sons, might continue for some ages in the"
7345,THE PREFACE.,whole posterity. That afterwards it was included wholly in the family of
7346,THE PREFACE.,Shem is manifest; but when the progenies of Ham and Japhet swarmed into
7347,THE PREFACE.,"colonies, and those colonies were subdivided into many others, in"
7348,THE PREFACE.,process of time their descendants lost by little and little the
7349,THE PREFACE.,"primitive and purer rites of divine worship, retaining only the notion"
7350,THE PREFACE.,of one Deity; to which succeeding generations added others: for men
7351,THE PREFACE.,took their degrees in those ages from conquerors to gods. Revelation
7352,THE PREFACE.,"being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind, the light of nature, as the"
7353,THE PREFACE.,"next in dignity, was substituted; and that is it which St Paul concludes"
7354,THE PREFACE.,"to be the rule of the heathens, and by which they are hereafter to be"
7355,THE PREFACE.,"judged. If my supposition be true, then the consequence which I have"
7356,THE PREFACE.,"assumed in my poem may be also true; namely, that Deism, or the"
7357,THE PREFACE.,"principles of natural worship, are only the faint remnants or dying"
7358,THE PREFACE.,flames of revealed religion in the posterity of Noah: and that our
7359,THE PREFACE.,"modern philosophers--nay, and some of our philosophising divines--have"
7360,THE PREFACE.,"too much exalted the faculties of our souls, when they have maintained"
7361,THE PREFACE.,that by their force mankind has been able to find out that there is one
7362,THE PREFACE.,supreme agent or intellectual Being which we call God: that praise and
7363,THE PREFACE.,"prayer are his due worship; and the rest of those deducements, which I"
7364,THE PREFACE.,"am confident are the remote effects of revelation, and unattainable by"
7365,THE PREFACE.,"our discourse, I mean as simply considered, and without the benefit of"
7366,THE PREFACE.,"divine illumination. So that we have not lifted up ourselves to God, by"
7367,THE PREFACE.,"the weak pinions of our reason, but he has been pleased to descend to"
7368,THE PREFACE.,"us; and what Socrates said of him, what Plato writ, and the rest of the"
7369,THE PREFACE.,"heathen philosophers of several nations, is all no more than the"
7370,THE PREFACE.,"twilight of revelation, after the sun of it was set in the race of Noah."
7371,THE PREFACE.,"That there is something above us, some principle of motion, our reason"
7372,THE PREFACE.,"can apprehend, though it cannot discover what it is by its own virtue."
7373,THE PREFACE.,"And, indeed, it is very improbable, that we, who by the strength of our"
7374,THE PREFACE.,"faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any Being, not so much as"
7375,THE PREFACE.,"of our own, should be able to find out by them, that supreme nature,"
7376,THE PREFACE.,which we cannot otherwise define than by saying it is infinite; as if
7377,THE PREFACE.,"infinite were definable, or infinity a subject for our narrow"
7378,THE PREFACE.,"understanding. They who would prove religion by reason, do but weaken"
7379,THE PREFACE.,the cause which they endeavour to support: it is to take away the
7380,THE PREFACE.,"pillars from our faith, and to prop it only with a twig; it is to design"
7381,THE PREFACE.,"a tower like that of Babel, which, if it were possible, as it is not, to"
7382,THE PREFACE.,"reach heaven, would come to nothing by the confusion of the workmen. For"
7383,THE PREFACE.,every man is building a several way; impotently conceited of his own
7384,THE PREFACE.,"model and his own materials: reason is always striving, and always at a"
7385,THE PREFACE.,"loss; and of necessity it must so come to pass, while it is exercised"
7386,THE PREFACE.,about that which is not its own proper object. Let us be content at last
7387,THE PREFACE.,"to know God by his own methods; at least, so much of him as he is"
7388,THE PREFACE.,pleased to reveal to us in the sacred Scriptures: to apprehend them to
7389,THE PREFACE.,be the Word of God is all our reason has to do; for all beyond it is the
7390,THE PREFACE.,"work of faith, which is the seal of Heaven impressed upon our human"
7391,THE PREFACE.,understanding.
7392,THE PREFACE.,
7393,THE PREFACE.,And now for what concerns the holy bishop Athanasius; the preface of
7394,THE PREFACE.,"whose creed seems inconsistent with my opinion; which is, that heathens"
7395,THE PREFACE.,"may possibly be saved. In the first place, I desire it may be considered"
7396,THE PREFACE.,"that it is the preface only, not the creed itself, which, till I am"
7397,THE PREFACE.,"better informed, is of too hard a digestion for my charity. It is not"
7398,THE PREFACE.,that I am ignorant how many several texts of Scripture seemingly support
7399,THE PREFACE.,that cause; but neither am I ignorant how all those texts may receive a
7400,THE PREFACE.,kinder and more mollified interpretation. Every man who is read in
7401,THE PREFACE.,"Church history, knows that belief was drawn up after a long contestation"
7402,THE PREFACE.,"with Arius, concerning the divinity of our blessed Saviour, and his"
7403,THE PREFACE.,"being one substance with the Father; and that thus compiled, it was sent"
7404,THE PREFACE.,"abroad among the Christian Churches, as a kind of test, which whosoever"
7405,THE PREFACE.,took was looked upon as an orthodox believer. It is manifest from
7406,THE PREFACE.,"hence, that the heathen part of the empire was not concerned in it; for"
7407,THE PREFACE.,"its business was not to distinguish betwixt Pagans and Christians, but"
7408,THE PREFACE.,"betwixt Heretics and true Believers. This, well considered, takes off"
7409,THE PREFACE.,"the heavy weight of censure, which I would willingly avoid, from so"
7410,THE PREFACE.,"venerable a man; for if this proportion, ""whosoever will be saved,"" be"
7411,THE PREFACE.,"restrained only to those to whom it was intended, and for whom it was"
7412,THE PREFACE.,"composed, I mean the Christians; then the anathema reaches not the"
7413,THE PREFACE.,"heathens, who had never heard of Christ, and were nothing interested in"
7414,THE PREFACE.,"that dispute. After all, I am far from blaming even that prefatory"
7415,THE PREFACE.,"addition to the creed, and as far from cavilling at the continuation of"
7416,THE PREFACE.,"it in the Liturgy of the Church, where, on the days appointed, it is"
7417,THE PREFACE.,"publicly read: for I suppose there is the same reason for it now, in"
7418,THE PREFACE.,"opposition to the Socinians, as there was then against the Arians; the"
7419,THE PREFACE.,"one being a heresy, which seems to have been refined out of the other;"
7420,THE PREFACE.,"and with how much more plausibility of reason it combats our religion,"
7421,THE PREFACE.,with so much more caution it ought to be avoided: therefore the prudence
7422,THE PREFACE.,"of our Church is to be commended, which has interposed her authority for"
7423,THE PREFACE.,the recommendation of this creed. Yet to such as are grounded in the
7424,THE PREFACE.,"true belief, those explanatory creeds, the Nicene and this of"
7425,THE PREFACE.,"Athanasius, might perhaps be spared; for what is supernatural will"
7426,THE PREFACE.,"always be a mystery, in spite of exposition; and for my own part, the"
7427,THE PREFACE.,"plain Apostles' creed is most suitable to my weak understanding, as the"
7428,THE PREFACE.,simplest diet is the most easy of digestion.
7429,THE PREFACE.,
7430,THE PREFACE.,"I have dwelt longer on this subject than I intended, and longer than"
7431,THE PREFACE.,"perhaps I ought; for having laid down, as my foundation, that the"
7432,THE PREFACE.,Scripture is a rule; that in all things needful to salvation it is
7433,THE PREFACE.,"clear, sufficient, and ordained by God Almighty for that purpose, I have"
7434,THE PREFACE.,"left myself no right to interpret obscure places, such as concern the"
7435,THE PREFACE.,possibility of eternal happiness to heathens: because whatsoever is
7436,THE PREFACE.,obscure is concluded not necessary to be known.
7437,THE PREFACE.,
7438,THE PREFACE.,"But, by asserting the Scripture to be the canon of oar faith, I have"
7439,THE PREFACE.,"unavoidably created to myself two sorts of enemies: the Papists indeed,"
7440,THE PREFACE.,"more directly, because they have kept the Scriptures from us what they"
7441,THE PREFACE.,could; and have reserved to themselves a right of interpreting what they
7442,THE PREFACE.,have delivered under the pretence of infallibility: and the Fanatics
7443,THE PREFACE.,"more collaterally, because they have assumed what amounts to an"
7444,THE PREFACE.,"infallibility, in the private spirit; and have detorted those texts of"
7445,THE PREFACE.,"Scripture which are not necessary to salvation, to the damnable uses of"
7446,THE PREFACE.,"sedition, disturbance, and destruction of the civil government. To begin"
7447,THE PREFACE.,"with the Papists, and to speak freely, I think them the less dangerous,"
7448,THE PREFACE.,at least in appearance to our present state; for not only the penal laws
7449,THE PREFACE.,"are in force against them, and their number is contemptible, but also"
7450,THE PREFACE.,"their peers and commons are excluded from parliament, and consequently"
7451,THE PREFACE.,those laws in no probability of being repealed. A general and
7452,THE PREFACE.,"uninterrupted plot of their clergy, ever since the Reformation, I"
7453,THE PREFACE.,suppose all Protestants believe; for it is not reasonable to think but
7454,THE PREFACE.,"that so many of their orders, as were outed from their fat possessions,"
7455,THE PREFACE.,would endeavour a re-entrance against those whom they account heretics.
7456,THE PREFACE.,"As for the late design, Mr Coleman's letters, for aught I know, are the"
7457,THE PREFACE.,"best evidence; and what they discover, without wiredrawing their sense,"
7458,THE PREFACE.,"or malicious glosses, all men of reason conclude credible. If there be"
7459,THE PREFACE.,"anything more than this required of me, I must believe it as well as I"
7460,THE PREFACE.,"am able, in spite of the witnesses, and out of a decent conformity to"
7461,THE PREFACE.,the votes of parliament; for I suppose the Fanatics will not allow the
7462,THE PREFACE.,private spirit in this case. Here the infallibility is at least in one
7463,THE PREFACE.,part of the government; and our understandings as well as our wills are
7464,THE PREFACE.,"represented. But to return to the Roman Catholics, how can we be secure"
7465,THE PREFACE.,from the practice of Jesuited Papists in that religion? For not two or
7466,THE PREFACE.,"three of that order, as some of them would impose upon us, but almost"
7467,THE PREFACE.,"the whole body of them are of opinion, that their infallible master has"
7468,THE PREFACE.,"a right over kings, not only in spirituals but temporals. Not to name"
7469,THE PREFACE.,"Mariana, Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa, Molina, Santare, Simancha,[85] and at"
7470,THE PREFACE.,least twenty others of foreign countries; we can produce of our own
7471,THE PREFACE.,"nation, Campian, and Doleman or Parsons; besides, many are named whom I"
7472,THE PREFACE.,"have not read, who all of them attest this doctrine, that the pope can"
7473,THE PREFACE.,"depose and give away the right of any sovereign prince, _si vel paulum"
7474,THE PREFACE.,"deflexerit_, if he shall never so little warp: but if he once comes to"
7475,THE PREFACE.,"be excommunicated, then the bond of obedience is taken off from"
7476,THE PREFACE.,"subjects; and they may, and ought to drive him, like another"
7477,THE PREFACE.,"Nebuchadnezzar, _ex hominum Christianorum dominatu_, from exercising"
7478,THE PREFACE.,dominion over Christians; and to this they are bound by virtue of divine
7479,THE PREFACE.,"precept, and by all the ties of conscience, under no less penalty than"
7480,THE PREFACE.,"damnation. If they answer me, as a learned priest has lately written,"
7481,THE PREFACE.,that this doctrine of the Jesuits is not _de fide_; and that
7482,THE PREFACE.,"consequently they are not obliged by it, they must pardon me, if I think"
7483,THE PREFACE.,they have said nothing to the purpose; for it is a maxim in their
7484,THE PREFACE.,"church, where points of faith are not decided, and that doctors are of"
7485,THE PREFACE.,"contrary opinions, they may follow which part they please; but more"
7486,THE PREFACE.,safely the most received and most authorised. And their champion
7487,THE PREFACE.,"Bellarmine has told the world, in his Apology, that the king of England"
7488,THE PREFACE.,"is a vassal to the pope, _ratione directi domini_, and that he holds in"
7489,THE PREFACE.,villanage of his Roman landlord: which is no new claim put in for
7490,THE PREFACE.,"England. Our chronicles are his authentic witnesses, that King John was"
7491,THE PREFACE.,"deposed by the same plea, and Philip Augustus admitted tenant. And which"
7492,THE PREFACE.,"makes the more for Bellarmine, the French king was again ejected when"
7493,THE PREFACE.,"our king submitted to the church, and the crown was received under the"
7494,THE PREFACE.,sordid condition of a vassalage.
7495,THE PREFACE.,
7496,THE PREFACE.,"It is not sufficient for the more moderate and well-meaning Papists, of"
7497,THE PREFACE.,"which I doubt not there are many, to produce the evidences of their"
7498,THE PREFACE.,"loyalty to the late king, and to declare their innocency in this plot: I"
7499,THE PREFACE.,will grant their behaviour in the first to have been as loyal and as
7500,THE PREFACE.,brave as they desire; and will be willing to hold them excused as to the
7501,THE PREFACE.,"second, I mean when it comes to my turn, and after my betters; for it is"
7502,THE PREFACE.,"a madness to be sober alone, while the nation continues drank: but that"
7503,THE PREFACE.,"saying of their father Cres. is still running in my head, that they may"
7504,THE PREFACE.,"be dispensed with in their obedience to an heretic prince, while the"
7505,THE PREFACE.,"necessity of the times shall oblige them to it: for that, as another of"
7506,THE PREFACE.,"them tells us, is only the effect of Christian prudence; but when once"
7507,THE PREFACE.,"they shall get power to shake him off, an heretic is no lawful king, and"
7508,THE PREFACE.,"consequently to rise against him is no rebellion. I should be glad,"
7509,THE PREFACE.,"therefore, that they would follow the advice which was charitably given"
7510,THE PREFACE.,"them by a reverend prelate of our church; namely, that they would join"
7511,THE PREFACE.,in a public act of disowning and detesting those Jesuitic principles;
7512,THE PREFACE.,and subscribe to all doctrines which deny the pope's authority of
7513,THE PREFACE.,"deposing kings, and releasing subjects from their oath of allegiance: to"
7514,THE PREFACE.,"which I should think they might easily be induced, if it be true that"
7515,THE PREFACE.,"this present pope has condemned the doctrine of king-killing, a thesis"
7516,THE PREFACE.,"of the Jesuits maintained, amongst others, _ex cathedra_, as they call"
7517,THE PREFACE.,"it, or in open consistory."
7518,THE PREFACE.,
7519,THE PREFACE.,"Leaving them, therefore, in so fair a way, if they please themselves, of"
7520,THE PREFACE.,satisfying all reasonable men of their sincerity and good meaning to the
7521,THE PREFACE.,"government, I shall make bold to consider that other extreme of our"
7522,THE PREFACE.,"religion--I mean the Fanatics, or Schismatics, of the English Church."
7523,THE PREFACE.,"Since the Bible has been translated into our tongue, they have used it"
7524,THE PREFACE.,"so, as if their business was not to be saved, but to be damned by its"
7525,THE PREFACE.,"contents. If we consider only them, better had it been for the English"
7526,THE PREFACE.,"nation that it had still remained in the original Greek and Hebrew, or"
7527,THE PREFACE.,"at least in the honest Latin of St Jerome, than that several texts in it"
7528,THE PREFACE.,"should have been prevaricated, to the destruction of that government"
7529,THE PREFACE.,which put it into so ungrateful hands.
7530,THE PREFACE.,
7531,THE PREFACE.,"How many heresies the first translation of Tindal produced in few years,"
7532,THE PREFACE.,"let my Lord Herbert's history of Henry VIII. inform you; insomuch, that"
7533,THE PREFACE.,"for the gross errors in it, and the great mischiefs it occasioned, a"
7534,THE PREFACE.,"sentence passed on the first edition of the Bible, too shameful almost"
7535,THE PREFACE.,"to be repeated. After the short reign of Edward VI., who had continued"
7536,THE PREFACE.,"to carry on the Reformation on other principles than it was begun, every"
7537,THE PREFACE.,"one knows that not only the chief promoters of that work, but many"
7538,THE PREFACE.,"others, whose consciences would not dispense with Popery, were forced,"
7539,THE PREFACE.,"for fear of persecution, to change climates: from whence returning at"
7540,THE PREFACE.,"the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, many of them who had been in"
7541,THE PREFACE.,"France, and at Geneva, brought back the rigid opinions and imperious"
7542,THE PREFACE.,"discipline of Calvin, to graft upon our Reformation: which, though they"
7543,THE PREFACE.,"cunningly concealed at first, as well knowing how nauseously that drug"
7544,THE PREFACE.,"would go down in a lawful monarchy, which was prescribed for a"
7545,THE PREFACE.,"rebellious commonwealth, yet they always kept it in reserve; and were"
7546,THE PREFACE.,"never wanting to themselves either in court or parliament, when either"
7547,THE PREFACE.,"they had any prospect of a numerous party of fanatic members of the one,"
7548,THE PREFACE.,"or the encouragement of any favourite in the other, whose covetousness"
7549,THE PREFACE.,was gaping at the patrimony of the Church. They who will consult the
7550,THE PREFACE.,"works of our venerable Hooker, or the account of his life, or more"
7551,THE PREFACE.,particularly the letter written to him on this subject by George
7552,THE PREFACE.,"Cranmer, may see by what gradations they proceeded: from the dislike of"
7553,THE PREFACE.,"cap and surplice, the very next step was admonitions to the parliament"
7554,THE PREFACE.,against the whole government ecclesiastical: then came out volumes in
7555,THE PREFACE.,English and Latin in defence of their tenets: and immediately practices
7556,THE PREFACE.,were set on foot to erect their discipline without authority. Those not
7557,THE PREFACE.,"succeeding, satire and railing was the next: and Martin Mar-prelate, the"
7558,THE PREFACE.,"Marvel of those times, was the first Presbyterian scribbler, who"
7559,THE PREFACE.,sanctified libels and scurrility to the use of the good old cause: which
7560,THE PREFACE.,"was done, says my author, upon this account; that their serious"
7561,THE PREFACE.,"treatises having been fully answered and refuted, they might compass by"
7562,THE PREFACE.,"railing what they had lost by reasoning; and, when their cause was sunk"
7563,THE PREFACE.,"in court and parliament, they might at least hedge in a stake amongst"
7564,THE PREFACE.,the rabble: for to their ignorance all things are wit which are abusive;
7565,THE PREFACE.,"but if Church and State were made the theme, then the doctoral degree of"
7566,THE PREFACE.,wit was to be taken at Billingsgate: even the most saint-like of the
7567,THE PREFACE.,"party, though they durst not excuse this contempt and vilifying of the"
7568,THE PREFACE.,"government, yet were pleased, and grinned at it with a pious smile; and"
7569,THE PREFACE.,"called it a judgment of God against the hierarchy. Thus sectaries, we"
7570,THE PREFACE.,"may see, were born with teeth, foul-mouthed and scurrilous from their"
7571,THE PREFACE.,"infancy: and if spiritual pride, venom, violence, contempt of superiors,"
7572,THE PREFACE.,"and slander, had been the marks of orthodox belief, the presbytery and"
7573,THE PREFACE.,"the rest of our schismatics, which are their spawn, were always the most"
7574,THE PREFACE.,visible church in the Christian world.
7575,THE PREFACE.,
7576,THE PREFACE.,"It is true, the government was too strong at that time for a rebellion;"
7577,THE PREFACE.,"but, to show what proficiency they had made in Calvin's school, even"
7578,THE PREFACE.,"then their mouths watered at it: for two of their gifted brotherhood,"
7579,THE PREFACE.,"Hacket[86] and Coppinger, as the story tells us, got up into a"
7580,THE PREFACE.,"pease-cart and harangue the people, to dispose them to an insurrection,"
7581,THE PREFACE.,and to establish their discipline by force: so that however it comes
7582,THE PREFACE.,"about, that now they celebrate Queen Elizabeth's birth-night as that of"
7583,THE PREFACE.,their saint and patroness; yet then they were for doing the work of the
7584,THE PREFACE.,Lord by arms against her; and in all probability they wanted but a
7585,THE PREFACE.,fanatic lord mayor and two sheriffs of their party to have compassed it.
7586,THE PREFACE.,
7587,THE PREFACE.,"Our venerable Hooker, after many admonitions which he had given them,"
7588,THE PREFACE.,towards the end of his preface breaks out into this prophetic speech:--
7589,THE PREFACE.,"""There is in every one of these considerations most just cause to fear,"
7590,THE PREFACE.,lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence
7591,THE PREFACE.,(meaning the Presbyterian discipline) should cause posterity to feel
7592,THE PREFACE.,"those evils, which as yet are more easy for us to prevent, than they"
7593,THE PREFACE.,"would be for them to remedy."""
7594,THE PREFACE.,
7595,THE PREFACE.,"How fatally this Cassandra has foretold, we know too well by sad"
7596,THE PREFACE.,"experience: the seeds were sown in the time of Queen Elizabeth, the"
7597,THE PREFACE.,"bloody harvest ripened in the reign of King Charles the Martyr; and,"
7598,THE PREFACE.,because all the sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some
7599,THE PREFACE.,"of the loose grains, another crop is too like to follow; nay, I fear it"
7600,THE PREFACE.,"is unavoidable, if the conventiclers be permitted still to scatter."
7601,THE PREFACE.,
7602,THE PREFACE.,"A man may be suffered to quote an adversary to our religion, when he"
7603,THE PREFACE.,"speaks truth; and it is the observation of Maimbourg, in his ""History of"
7604,THE PREFACE.,"Calvinism,"" that wherever that discipline was planted and embraced,"
7605,THE PREFACE.,"rebellion, civil war, and misery attended it. And how, indeed, should it"
7606,THE PREFACE.,happen otherwise? Reformation of Church and State has always been the
7607,THE PREFACE.,"ground of our divisions in England. While we were Papists, our holy"
7608,THE PREFACE.,"father rid us, by pretending authority out of the Scriptures to depose"
7609,THE PREFACE.,"princes; when we shook off his authority, the sectaries furnished"
7610,THE PREFACE.,"themselves with the same weapons, and out of the same magazine, the"
7611,THE PREFACE.,"Bible; so that the Scriptures, which are in themselves the greatest"
7612,THE PREFACE.,"security of governors, as commanding express obedience to them, are now"
7613,THE PREFACE.,turned to their destruction; and never since the Reformation has there
7614,THE PREFACE.,wanted a text of their interpreting to authorise a rebel. And it is to
7615,THE PREFACE.,"be noted, by the way, that the doctrines of king-killing and deposing,"
7616,THE PREFACE.,"which have been taken up only by the worst party of the Papists, the"
7617,THE PREFACE.,"most frontless flatterers of the pope's authority, have been espoused,"
7618,THE PREFACE.,"defended, and are still maintained by the whole body of nonconformists"
7619,THE PREFACE.,"and republicans. It is but dubbing themselves the people of God, which"
7620,THE PREFACE.,"it is the interest of their preachers to tell them they are, and their"
7621,THE PREFACE.,"own interest to believe; and, after that, they cannot dip into the"
7622,THE PREFACE.,"Bible, but one text or another will turn up for their purpose: if they"
7623,THE PREFACE.,"are under persecution, as they call it, then that is a mark of their"
7624,THE PREFACE.,"election; if they flourish, then God works miracles for their"
7625,THE PREFACE.,"deliverance, and the saints are to possess the earth."
7626,THE PREFACE.,
7627,THE PREFACE.,They may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this paper; but
7628,THE PREFACE.,"I, who know best how far I could have gone on this subject, must be bold"
7629,THE PREFACE.,to tell them they are spared: though at the same time I am not ignorant
7630,THE PREFACE.,"that they interpret the mildness of a writer to them, as they do the"
7631,THE PREFACE.,"mercy of the government; in the one they think it fear, and conclude it"
7632,THE PREFACE.,"weakness in the other. The best way for them to confute me is, as I"
7633,THE PREFACE.,"before advised the Papists, to disclaim their principles and renounce"
7634,THE PREFACE.,their practices. We shall all be glad to think them true Englishmen when
7635,THE PREFACE.,"they obey the king, and true Protestants when they conform to the church"
7636,THE PREFACE.,discipline.
7637,THE PREFACE.,
7638,THE PREFACE.,"It remains that I acquaint the reader, that these verses were written"
7639,THE PREFACE.,"for an ingenious young gentleman,[87] my friend, upon his translation of"
7640,THE PREFACE.,"""The Critical History of the Old Testament,"" composed by the learned"
7641,THE PREFACE.,"Father Simon: the verses, therefore, are addressed to the translator of"
7642,THE PREFACE.,"that work, and the style of them is, what it ought to be, epistolary."
7643,THE PREFACE.,
7644,THE PREFACE.,"If any one be so lamentable a critic as to require the smoothness, the"
7645,THE PREFACE.,"numbers, and the turn of heroic poetry in this poem, I must tell him,"
7646,THE PREFACE.,"that if he has not read Horace, I have studied him, and hope the style"
7647,THE PREFACE.,of his epistles is not ill imitated here. The expressions of a poem
7648,THE PREFACE.,"designed purely for instruction, ought to be plain and natural, and yet"
7649,THE PREFACE.,"majestic: for here the poet is presumed to be a kind of lawgiver, and"
7650,THE PREFACE.,"those three qualities which I have named, are proper to the legislative"
7651,THE PREFACE.,"style. The florid, elevated, and figurative way is for the passions; for"
7652,THE PREFACE.,"love and hatred, fear and anger, are begotten in the soul, by showing"
7653,THE PREFACE.,"their objects out of their true proportion, either greater than the life"
7654,THE PREFACE.,or less: but instruction is to be given by showing them what they
7655,THE PREFACE.,"naturally are. A man is to be cheated into passion, but to be reasoned"
7656,THE PREFACE.,into truth.

7671,THE PREFACE.,"Some few, whose lamp shone brighter, have been led"

7690,THE PREFACE.,The wiser madmen did for Virtue toil--
7691,THE PREFACE.,"A thorny, or at best a barren soil:"
7692,THE PREFACE.,In Pleasure some their glutton souls would steep;
7693,THE PREFACE.,"But found their line too short, the well too deep;"
7694,THE PREFACE.,And leaky vessels which no bliss could keep.
7695,THE PREFACE.,"Thus anxious thoughts in endless circles roll,"
7696,THE PREFACE.,Without a centre where to fix the soul:

7958,THE PREFACE.,"Then her infallibility, as well"
7959,THE PREFACE.,"Where copies are corrupt or lame, can tell;"
7960,THE PREFACE.,"Restore lost canon with as little pains,"
7961,THE PREFACE.,As truly explicate what still remains:
7962,THE PREFACE.,Which yet no Council dare pretend to do;                           290
7963,THE PREFACE.,"Unless, like Esdras, they could write it new:"
7964,THE PREFACE.,"Strange confidence still to interpret true,"
7965,THE PREFACE.,Yet not be sure that all they have explain'd
7966,THE PREFACE.,Is in the blest original contain'd!
7967,THE PREFACE.,"More safe, and much more modest 'tis to say,"
7968,THE PREFACE.,God would not leave mankind without a way:
7969,THE PREFACE.,"And that the Scriptures, though not every where"
7970,THE PREFACE.,"Free from corruption, or entire, or clear,"
7971,THE PREFACE.,"Are uncorrupt, sufficient, clear, entire,"
7972,THE PREFACE.,In all things which our needful faith require.                     300
7973,THE PREFACE.,"If others in the same glass better see,"
7974,THE PREFACE.,"'Tis for themselves they look, but not for me:"
7975,THE PREFACE.,"For my salvation must its doom receive,"
7976,THE PREFACE.,"Not from what others, but what I believe."
7977,THE PREFACE.,
7978,THE PREFACE.,Must all tradition then be set aside?
7979,THE PREFACE.,This to affirm were ignorance or pride.
7980,THE PREFACE.,"Are there not many points, some needful sure"
7981,THE PREFACE.,"To saving faith, that Scripture leaves obscure?"
7982,THE PREFACE.,"Which every sect will wrest a several way,"
7983,THE PREFACE.,"For what one sect interprets, all sects may.                       310"
7984,THE PREFACE.,"We hold, and say we prove from Scripture plain,"
7985,THE PREFACE.,That Christ is God; the bold Socinian
7986,THE PREFACE.,From the same Scripture urges he's but man.
7987,THE PREFACE.,"Now, what appeal can end the important suit?"
7988,THE PREFACE.,"Both parts talk loudly, but the rule is mute."
7989,THE PREFACE.,
7990,THE PREFACE.,"Shall I speak plain, and in a nation free"
7991,THE PREFACE.,Assume an honest layman's liberty?
7992,THE PREFACE.,"I think, according to my little skill,"
7993,THE PREFACE.,"To my own Mother Church submitting still,"
7994,THE PREFACE.,"That many have been saved, and many may,                           320"
7995,THE PREFACE.,Who never heard this question brought in play.
7996,THE PREFACE.,"Th' unletter'd Christian, who believes in gross,"
7997,THE PREFACE.,"Plods on to heaven, and ne'er is at a loss;"
7998,THE PREFACE.,"For the strait gate would be made straiter yet,"
7999,THE PREFACE.,Were none admitted there but men of wit.
8000,THE PREFACE.,"The few by nature form'd, with learning fraught,"
8001,THE PREFACE.,"Born to instruct, as others to be taught,"
8002,THE PREFACE.,Must study well the sacred page; and see
8003,THE PREFACE.,"Which doctrine, this or that, does best agree"
8004,THE PREFACE.,With the whole tenor of the work divine:                           330
8005,THE PREFACE.,And plainliest points to Heaven's reveal'd design:
8006,THE PREFACE.,Which exposition flows from genuine sense;
8007,THE PREFACE.,And which is forced by wit and eloquence.
8008,THE PREFACE.,"Not that tradition's parts are useless here,"
8009,THE PREFACE.,"When general, old, disinteress'd, and clear:"
8010,THE PREFACE.,"That ancient Fathers thus expound the page,"
8011,THE PREFACE.,Gives Truth the reverend majesty of age:
8012,THE PREFACE.,"Confirms its force, by biding every test;"
8013,THE PREFACE.,For best authority's next rules are best.
8014,THE PREFACE.,"And still the nearer to the spring we go,                          340"
8015,THE PREFACE.,"More limpid, more unsoil'd, the waters flow."
8016,THE PREFACE.,"Thus first traditions were a proof alone,"
8017,THE PREFACE.,"Could we be certain such they were, so known:"
8018,THE PREFACE.,"But since some flaws in long descent may be,"
8019,THE PREFACE.,They make not truth but probability.
8020,THE PREFACE.,Even Arius and Pelagius durst provoke
8021,THE PREFACE.,To what the centuries preceding spoke.
8022,THE PREFACE.,Such difference is there in an oft-told tale:
8023,THE PREFACE.,But Truth by its own sinews will prevail.
8024,THE PREFACE.,"Tradition written, therefore, more commends                        350"
8025,THE PREFACE.,"Authority, than what from voice descends:"
8026,THE PREFACE.,"And this, as perfect as its kind can be,"
8027,THE PREFACE.,Rolls down to us the sacred history:
8028,THE PREFACE.,"Which from the Universal Church received,"
8029,THE PREFACE.,"Is tried, and after for itself believed."
8030,THE PREFACE.,
8031,THE PREFACE.,"The partial Papists would infer from hence,"
8032,THE PREFACE.,"Their Church, in last resort, should judge the sense."
8033,THE PREFACE.,"But first they would assume, with wondrous art,"
8034,THE PREFACE.,"Themselves to be the whole, who are but part,"
8035,THE PREFACE.,Of that vast frame the Church; yet grant they were                 360
8036,THE PREFACE.,"The handers down, can they from thence infer"
8037,THE PREFACE.,A right to interpret? or would they alone
8038,THE PREFACE.,"Who brought the present, claim it for their own?"
8039,THE PREFACE.,The Book's a common largess to mankind;
8040,THE PREFACE.,Not more for them than every man design'd:
8041,THE PREFACE.,The welcome news is in the letter found;
8042,THE PREFACE.,The carrier's not commissioned to expound;
8043,THE PREFACE.,"It speaks itself, and what it does contain"
8044,THE PREFACE.,In all things needful to be known is plain.
8045,THE PREFACE.,
8046,THE PREFACE.,"In times o'ergrown with rust and ignorance,                     370"
8047,THE PREFACE.,A gainful trade their clergy did advance:
8048,THE PREFACE.,"When want of learning kept the laymen low,"
8049,THE PREFACE.,And none but priests were authorised to know:
8050,THE PREFACE.,"When what small knowledge was, in them did dwell;"
8051,THE PREFACE.,"And he a god, who could but read and spell:"
8052,THE PREFACE.,Then Mother Church did mightily prevail;
8053,THE PREFACE.,She parcell'd out the Bible by retail:
8054,THE PREFACE.,But still expounded what she sold or gave;
8055,THE PREFACE.,To keep it in her power to damn and save.
8056,THE PREFACE.,"Scripture was scarce, and as the market went,                      380"
8057,THE PREFACE.,Poor laymen took salvation on content;
8058,THE PREFACE.,"As needy men take money, good or bad:"
8059,THE PREFACE.,"God's Word they had not, but th' priest's they had."
8060,THE PREFACE.,"Yet, whate'er false conveyances they made,"
8061,THE PREFACE.,The lawyer still was certain to be paid.
8062,THE PREFACE.,"In those dark times they learn'd their knack so well,"
8063,THE PREFACE.,That by long use they grew infallible.
8064,THE PREFACE.,At last a knowing age began to inquire
8065,THE PREFACE.,"If they the Book, or that did them inspire:"
8066,THE PREFACE.,"And making narrower search, they found, though late,               390"
8067,THE PREFACE.,"That what they thought the priest's, was their estate;"
8068,THE PREFACE.,"Taught by the will produced, the written Word,"
8069,THE PREFACE.,How long they had been cheated on record.
8070,THE PREFACE.,"Then every man who saw the title fair,"
8071,THE PREFACE.,"Claim'd a child's part, and put in for a share:"
8072,THE PREFACE.,"Consulted soberly his private good,"
8073,THE PREFACE.,And saved himself as cheap as e'er he could.
8074,THE PREFACE.,
8075,THE PREFACE.,"'Tis true, my friend, (and far be flattery hence),"
8076,THE PREFACE.,This good had full as bad a consequence:
8077,THE PREFACE.,"The Book thus put in every vulgar hand,                            400"
8078,THE PREFACE.,"Which each presumed he best could understand,"
8079,THE PREFACE.,The common rule was made the common prey;
8080,THE PREFACE.,And at the mercy of the rabble lay.
8081,THE PREFACE.,The tender page with horny fists was gall'd;
8082,THE PREFACE.,And he was gifted most that loudest bawl'd.
8083,THE PREFACE.,The spirit gave the doctoral degree:
8084,THE PREFACE.,And every member of a company
8085,THE PREFACE.,"Was of his trade, and of the Bible free."
8086,THE PREFACE.,
8087,THE PREFACE.,Plain truths enough for needful use they found;
8088,THE PREFACE.,But men would still be itching to expound:                         410
8089,THE PREFACE.,"Each was ambitious of the obscurest place,"
8090,THE PREFACE.,"No measure ta'en from knowledge, all from grace."
8091,THE PREFACE.,Study and pains were now no more their care;
8092,THE PREFACE.,Texts were explain'd by fasting and by prayer:
8093,THE PREFACE.,This was the fruit the private spirit brought;
8094,THE PREFACE.,Occasion'd by great zeal and little thought.
8095,THE PREFACE.,"While crowds unlearn'd, with rude devotion warm,"
8096,THE PREFACE.,About the sacred viands buzz and swarm.
8097,THE PREFACE.,"The fly-blown text creates a crawling brood,"
8098,THE PREFACE.,And turns to maggots what was meant for food.                      420
8099,THE PREFACE.,A thousand daily sects rise up and die;
8100,THE PREFACE.,A thousand more the perish'd race supply;
8101,THE PREFACE.,"So all we make of Heaven's discover'd will,"
8102,THE PREFACE.,"Is, not to have it, or to use it ill."
8103,THE PREFACE.,The danger's much the same; on several shelves
8104,THE PREFACE.,"If others wreck us, or we wreck ourselves."
8105,THE PREFACE.,
8106,THE PREFACE.,"What then remains, but, waiving each extreme,"
8107,THE PREFACE.,The tides of ignorance and pride to stem?
8108,THE PREFACE.,Neither so rich a treasure to forego;
8109,THE PREFACE.,Nor proudly seek beyond our power to know:                         430
8110,THE PREFACE.,Faith is not built on disquisitions vain;
8111,THE PREFACE.,The things we must believe are few and plain:
8112,THE PREFACE.,"But since men will believe more than they need,"
8113,THE PREFACE.,And every man will make himself a creed;
8114,THE PREFACE.,In doubtful questions 'tis the safest way
8115,THE PREFACE.,To learn what unsuspected ancients say:
8116,THE PREFACE.,For 'tis not likely we should higher soar
8117,THE PREFACE.,"In search of heaven, than all the Church before:"
8118,THE PREFACE.,"Nor can we be deceived, unless we see"
8119,THE PREFACE.,The Scripture and the Fathers disagree.                            440
8120,THE PREFACE.,"If, after all, they stand suspected still,"
8121,THE PREFACE.,(For no man's faith depends upon his will):
8122,THE PREFACE.,"'Tis some relief, that points not clearly known,"
8123,THE PREFACE.,Without much hazard may be let alone:
8124,THE PREFACE.,"And after hearing what our Church can say,"
8125,THE PREFACE.,"If still our reason runs another way,"
8126,THE PREFACE.,"That private reason 'tis more just to curb,"
8127,THE PREFACE.,Than by disputes the public peace disturb.
8128,THE PREFACE.,For points obscure are of small use to learn:
8129,THE PREFACE.,But common quiet is mankind's concern.                             450
8130,THE PREFACE.,
8131,THE PREFACE.,Thus have I made my own opinions clear;
8132,THE PREFACE.,"Yet neither praise expect, nor censure fear:"
8133,THE PREFACE.,"And this unpolish'd, rugged verse I chose,"
8134,THE PREFACE.,"As fittest for discourse, and nearest prose:"
8135,THE PREFACE.,"For while from sacred truth I do not swerve,"
8136,THE PREFACE.,Tom Sternhold's or Tom Shadwell's rhymes will serve.

8169,I.,I.
8170,I.,
8171,I.,Thus long my grief has kept me dumb:
8172,I.,"Sure there's a lethargy in mighty woe,"
8173,I.,"Tears stand congeal'd, and cannot flow;"
8174,I.,And the sad soul retires into her inmost room:
8175,I.,"Tears, for a stroke foreseen, afford relief;"
8176,I.,"But, unprovided for a sudden blow,"
8177,I.,Like Niobe we marble grow;
8178,I.,And petrify with grief.
8179,I.,
8180,I.,"Our British heaven was all serene,"
8181,I.,"No threatening cloud was nigh,"
8182,I.,Not the least wrinkle to deform the sky;
8183,I.,We lived as unconcern'd and happily
8184,I.,As the first age in Nature's golden scene;
8185,I.,"Supine amidst our flowing store,"
8186,I.,"We slept securely, and we dreamt of more:"
8187,I.,"When suddenly the thunder-clap was heard,"
8188,I.,"It took us unprepared and out of guard,"
8189,I.,Already lost before we fear'd.
8190,I.,"The amazing news of Charles at once were spread,"
8191,I.,"At once the general voice declared,"
8192,I.,"""Our gracious prince was dead."""
8193,I.,"No sickness known before, no slow disease,"
8194,I.,To soften grief by just degrees:
8195,I.,"But like a hurricane on Indian seas,"
8196,I.,The tempest rose;
8197,I.,An unexpected burst of woes;
8198,I.,With scarce a breathing space betwixt--
8199,I.,"This now becalm'd, and perishing the next."
8200,I.,As if great Atlas from his height
8201,I.,"Should sink beneath his heavenly weight,"
8202,I.,"And with a mighty flaw, the flaming wall"
8203,I.,"(At once it shall),"
8204,I.,"Should gape immense, and rushing down, o'erwhelm this nether ball;"

8207,I.,
8208,II.,II.
8209,II.,
8210,II.,"His pious brother, sure the best"
8211,II.,Who ever bore that name!
8212,II.,"Was newly risen from his rest,"
8213,II.,"And, with a fervent flame,"
8214,II.,His usual morning vows had just address'd
8215,II.,For his dear sovereign's health;
8216,II.,"And hoped to have them heard,"
8217,II.,"In long increase of years,"
8218,II.,"In honour, fame, and wealth:"
8219,II.,"Guiltless of greatness thus he always pray'd,"
8220,II.,"Nor knew nor wish'd those vows he made,"

8222,II.,"Soon as the ill-omen'd rumour reach'd his ear,"
8223,II.,"(Ill news is wing'd with fate, and flies apace,)"
8224,II.,Who can describe the amazement of his face!
8225,II.,"Horror in all his pomp was there,"
8226,II.,Mute and magnificent without a tear:
8227,II.,And then the hero first was seen to fear.
8228,II.,"Half unarray'd he ran to his relief,"
8229,II.,So hasty and so artless was his grief:
8230,II.,Approaching greatness met him with her charms
8231,II.,Of power and future state;
8232,II.,"But look'd so ghastly in a brother's fate,"
8233,II.,He shook her from his arms.
8234,II.,"Arrived within the mournful room, he saw"
8235,II.,"A wild distraction, void of awe,"
8236,II.,And arbitrary grief unbounded by a law.
8237,II.,"God's image, God's anointed lay"
8238,II.,"Without motion, pulse, or breath,"
8239,II.,"A senseless lump of sacred clay,"
8240,II.,An image now of death.
8241,II.,"Amidst his sad attendants' groans and cries,"
8242,II.,"The lines of that adored, forgiving face,"
8243,II.,Distorted from their native grace;
8244,II.,An iron slumber sat on his majestic eyes.
8245,II.,"The pious duke--Forbear, audacious Muse!"
8246,II.,No terms thy feeble art can use
8247,II.,Are able to adorn so vast a woe:
8248,II.,"The grief of all the rest like subject-grief did show,"
8249,II.,His like a sovereign did transcend;
8250,II.,"No wife, no brother, such a grief could know,"
8251,II.,Nor any name but friend.
8252,II.,
8253,III.,III.
8254,III.,
8255,III.,"O wondrous changes of a fatal scene,"
8256,III.,Still varying to the last!
8257,III.,"Heaven, though its hard decree was past,"
8258,III.,Seem'd pointing to a gracious turn again:
8259,III.,And death's uplifted arm arrested in its haste.
8260,III.,"Heaven half repented of the doom,"
8261,III.,"And almost grieved it had foreseen,"
8262,III.,What by foresight it will'd eternally to come.
8263,III.,Mercy above did hourly plead
8264,III.,For her resemblance here below;
8265,III.,And mild forgiveness intercede
8266,III.,To stop the coming blow.
8267,III.,"New miracles approach'd the ethereal throne,"
8268,III.,"Such as his wondrous life had oft and lately known,"
8269,III.,And urged that still they might be shown.
8270,III.,"On earth his pious brother pray'd and vow'd,"
8271,III.,"Renouncing greatness at so dear a rate,"
8272,III.,"Himself defending what he could,"
8273,III.,From all the glories of his future fate.
8274,III.,With him the innumerable crowd
8275,III.,Of armed prayers
8276,III.,"Knock'd at the gates of Heaven, and knock'd aloud;"
8277,III.,"The first well-meaning rude petitioners,"
8278,III.,"All for his life assail'd the throne,"
8279,III.,All would have bribed the skies by offering up their own.
8280,III.,So great a throng not Heaven itself could bar;
8281,III.,'Twas almost borne by force as in the giants' war.
8282,III.,"The prayers, at least, for his reprieve were heard;"
8283,III.,"His death, like Hezekiah's, was deferr'd:"
8284,III.,Against the sun the shadow went;
8285,III.,"Five days, those five degrees, were lent"
8286,III.,To form our patience and prepare the event.
8287,III.,"The second causes took the swift command,"
8288,III.,"The medicinal head, the ready hand,"
8289,III.,All eager to perform their part;
8290,III.,All but eternal doom was conquer'd by their art:
8291,III.,Once more the fleeting soul came back
8292,III.,To inspire the mortal frame;
8293,III.,"And in the body took a doubtful stand,"
8294,III.,"Doubtful and hovering like expiring flame,"
8295,III.,"That mounts and falls by turns, and trembles o'er the brand."
8296,III.,
8297,IV.,IV.
8298,IV.,
8299,IV.,"The joyful short-lived news soon spread around,"
8300,IV.,"Took the same train, the same impetuous bound:"
8301,IV.,"The drooping town in smiles again was dress'd,"
8302,IV.,"Gladness in every face express'd,"
8303,IV.,Their eyes before their tongues confess'd.
8304,IV.,"Men met each other with erected look,"
8305,IV.,The steps were higher that they took;
8306,IV.,Friends to congratulate their friends made haste;
8307,IV.,And long inveterate foes saluted as they pass'd:
8308,IV.,Above the rest heroic James appear'd--
8309,IV.,"Exalted more, because he more had fear'd:"
8310,IV.,"His manly heart, whose noble pride"
8311,IV.,Was still above
8312,IV.,"Dissembled hate or varnish'd love,"
8313,IV.,Its more than common transport could not hide;
8314,IV.,But like an eagre[90] rode in triumph o'er the tide.
8315,IV.,"Thus, in alternate course,"
8316,IV.,"The tyrant passions, hope and fear,"
8317,IV.,"Did in extremes appear,"
8318,IV.,And flash'd upon the soul with equal force.
8319,IV.,"Thus, at half ebb, a rolling sea"
8320,IV.,Returns and wins upon the shore;
8321,IV.,"The watery herd, affrighted at the roar,"
8322,IV.,"Rest on their fins awhile, and stay,"
8323,IV.,Then backward take their wondering way:
8324,IV.,"The prophet wonders more than they,"
8325,IV.,"At prodigies but rarely seen before,"
8326,IV.,"And cries, A king must fall, or kingdoms change their sway."
8327,IV.,"Such were our counter-tides at land, and so"
8328,IV.,"Presaging of the fatal blow,"
8329,IV.,In their prodigious ebb and flow.
8330,IV.,"The royal soul, that, like the labouring moon,"
8331,IV.,"By charms of art was hurried down,"
8332,IV.,"Forced with regret to leave her native sphere,"
8333,IV.,Came but awhile on liking here:
8334,IV.,"Soon weary of the painful strife,"
8335,IV.,And made but faint essays of life:
8336,IV.,An evening light
8337,IV.,Soon shut in night;
8338,IV.,"A strong distemper, and a weak relief,"
8339,IV.,"Short intervals of joy, and long returns of grief."
8340,IV.,
8341,V.,V.
8342,V.,
8343,V.,"The sons of art all medicines tried,"
8344,V.,And every noble remedy applied;
8345,V.,With emulation each essay'd
8346,V.,"His utmost skill, nay more, they pray'd:"
8347,V.,Never was losing game with better conduct play'd.
8348,V.,"Death never won a stake with greater toil,"
8349,V.,Nor e'er was fate so near a foil:
8350,V.,"But like a fortress on a rock,"
8351,V.,The impregnable disease their vain attempts did mock;
8352,V.,"They mined it near, they batter'd from afar"
8353,V.,"With, all the cannon of the medicinal war;"
8354,V.,"No gentle means could be essay'd,"
8355,V.,'Twas beyond parley when the siege was laid:
8356,V.,"The extremest ways they first ordain,"
8357,V.,"Prescribing such intolerable pain,"
8358,V.,As none but Cæsar could sustain:
8359,V.,Undaunted Csesar underwent
8360,V.,"The malice of their art, nor bent"
8361,V.,Beneath whate'er their pious rigour could invent:
8362,V.,In five such days he suffer'd more
8363,V.,Than any suffer'd in his reign before;
8364,V.,"More, infinitely more, than he,"
8365,V.,"Against the worst of rebels, could decree,"
8366,V.,"A traitor, or twice pardon'd enemy."
8367,V.,"Now art was tried without success,"
8368,V.,No racks could make the stubborn malady confess.
8369,V.,"The vain insurancers of life,"
8370,V.,"And they who most perform'd and promised less,"
8371,V.,Even Short and Hobbes[91] forsook the unequal strife.
8372,V.,"Death and despair were in their looks,"
8373,V.,No longer they consult their memories or books;
8374,V.,"Like helpless friends, who view from shore"
8375,V.,"The labouring ship, and hear the tempest roar;"
8376,V.,So stood they with their arms across;
8377,V.,"Not to assist, but to deplore"
8378,V.,The inevitable loss.
8379,V.,
8380,VI.,VI.
8381,VI.,
8382,VI.,Death was denounced; that frightful sound
8383,VI.,"Which even the best can hardly bear,"
8384,VI.,He took the summons void of fear;
8385,VI.,And unconcern'dly cast his eyes around;
8386,VI.,As if to find and dare the grisly challenger.
8387,VI.,"What death could do he lately tried,"
8388,VI.,When in four days he more than died.
8389,VI.,The same assurance all his words did grace;
8390,VI.,The same majestic mildness held its place:
8391,VI.,Nor lost the monarch in his dying face.
8392,VI.,"Intrepid, pious, merciful, and brave,"
8393,VI.,He look'd as when he conquer'd and forgave.
8394,VI.,
8395,VII.,VII.
8396,VII.,
8397,VII.,As if some angel had been sent
8398,VII.,"To lengthen out his government,"
8399,VII.,"And to foretell as many years again,"
8400,VII.,"As he had number'd in his happy reign,"
8401,VII.,So cheerfully he took the doom
8402,VII.,Of his departing breath;
8403,VII.,Nor shrunk nor stepp'd aside for death;
8404,VII.,"But with unalter'd pace kept on,"
8405,VII.,"Providing for events to come,"
8406,VII.,When he resign'd the throne.
8407,VII.,Still he maintain'd his kingly state;
8408,VII.,And grew familiar with his fate.
8409,VII.,"Kind, good, and gracious to the last,"
8410,VII.,On all he loved before his dying beams he cast:
8411,VII.,"Oh, truly good, and truly great,"
8412,VII.,"For glorious as he rose, benignly so he set!"
8413,VII.,"All that on earth he held most dear,"
8414,VII.,"He recommended to his care,"
8415,VII.,"To whom both Heaven,"
8416,VII.,The right had given
8417,VII.,And his own love bequeathed supreme command:
8418,VII.,He took and press'd that ever loyal hand
8419,VII.,"Which could in peace secure his reign,"
8420,VII.,"Which could in wars his power maintain,"
8421,VII.,That hand on which no plighted vows were ever vain.
8422,VII.,Well for so great a trust he chose
8423,VII.,A prince who never disobey'd:
8424,VII.,Not when the most severe commands were laid;
8425,VII.,"Nor want, nor exile with his duty weigh'd:"
8426,VII.,"A prince on whom, if Heaven its eyes could close,"
8427,VII.,The welfare of the world it safely might repose.
8428,VII.,
8429,VIII.,VIII.
8430,VIII.,
8431,VIII.,"That king[92] who lived to God's own heart,"
8432,VIII.,Yet less serenely died than he:
8433,VIII.,Charles left behind no harsh decree
8434,VIII.,For schoolmen with laborious art
8435,VIII.,To salve from cruelty:
8436,VIII.,"Those for whom love could no excuses frame,"
8437,VIII.,He graciously forgot to name.
8438,VIII.,"Thus far my Muse, though rudely, has design'd"
8439,VIII.,Some faint resemblance of his godlike mind:
8440,VIII.,But neither pen nor pencil can express
8441,VIII.,The parting brothers' tenderness:
8442,VIII.,Though that's a term too mean and low;
8443,VIII.,The blest above a kinder word may know.
8444,VIII.,"But what they did, and what they said,"
8445,VIII.,"The monarch who triumphant went,"
8446,VIII.,"The militant who staid,"
8447,VIII.,"Like painters, when their heightening arts are spent,"
8448,VIII.,I cast into a shade.
8449,VIII.,"That all-forgiving king,"
8450,VIII.,"The type of Him above,"
8451,VIII.,That inexhausted spring
8452,VIII.,Of clemency and love;
8453,VIII.,"Himself to his next self accused,"
8454,VIII.,And asked that pardon--which he ne'er refused:
8455,VIII.,"For faults not his, for guilt and crimes"
8456,VIII.,"Of godless men, and of rebellious times:"
8457,VIII.,"For an hard exile, kindly meant,"
8458,VIII.,When his ungrateful country sent
8459,VIII.,Their best Camillus into banishment:
8460,VIII.,And forced their sovereign's act--they could not his consent.
8461,VIII.,"Oh, how much rather had that injured chief"
8462,VIII.,"Repeated all his sufferings past,"
8463,VIII.,"Than hear a pardon begg'd at last,"
8464,VIII.,"Which, given, could give the dying no relief!"
8465,VIII.,"He bent, he sunk beneath his grief:"
8466,VIII.,His dauntless heart would fain have held
8467,VIII.,"From weeping, but his eyes rebell'd."
8468,VIII.,Perhaps the godlike hero in his breast
8469,VIII.,"Disdain'd, or was ashamed to show,"
8470,VIII.,"So weak, so womanish a woe,"
8471,VIII.,Which yet the brother and the friend so plenteously confess'd.
8472,VIII.,
8473,IX.,IX.
8474,IX.,
8475,IX.,"Amidst that silent shower, the royal mind"
8476,IX.,"An easy passage found,"
8477,IX.,And left its sacred earth behind:
8478,IX.,"Nor murmuring groan express'd, nor labouring sound,"
8479,IX.,Nor any least tumultuous breath;
8480,IX.,"Calm was his life, and quiet was his death."
8481,IX.,"Soft as those gentle whispers were,"
8482,IX.,In which the Almighty did appear;
8483,IX.,By the still voice the prophet[93] knew him there.
8484,IX.,"That peace which made thy prosperous reign to shine,"
8485,IX.,"That peace thou leavest to thy imperial line,"
8486,IX.,"That peace, oh, happy shade, be ever thine!"
8487,IX.,
8488,X.,X.
8489,X.,
8490,X.,"For all those joys thy restoration brought,"
8491,X.,"For all the miracles it wrought,"
8492,X.,For all the healing balm thy mercy pour'd
8493,X.,"Into the nation's bleeding wound,"
8494,X.,"And care that after kept it sound,"
8495,X.,"For numerous blessings yearly shower'd,"
8496,X.,And property with plenty crown'd;
8497,X.,"For freedom, still maintain'd alive--"
8498,X.,Freedom! which in no other land will thrive--
8499,X.,"Freedom! an English subject's sole prerogative,"
8500,X.,Without whose charms even peace would be
8501,X.,"But a dull, quiet slavery:"
8502,X.,"For these and more, accept our pious praise;"
8503,X.,'Tis all the subsidy
8504,X.,"The present age can raise,"
8505,X.,The rest is charged on late posterity:
8506,X.,"Posterity is charged the more,"
8507,X.,Because the large abounding store
8508,X.,"To them and to their heirs, is still entail'd by thee."
8509,X.,Succession of a long descent
8510,X.,"Which chastely in the channels ran,"
8511,X.,"And from our demi-gods began,"
8512,X.,"Equal almost to time in its extent,"
8513,X.,"Through hazards numberless and great,"
8514,X.,"Thou hast derived this mighty blessing down,"
8515,X.,And fix'd the fairest gem that decks the imperial crown
8516,X.,"Not faction, when it shook thy regal seat,"
8517,X.,"Not senates, insolently loud,"
8518,X.,"Those echoes of a thoughtless crowd,"
8519,X.,"Not foreign or domestic treachery,"
8520,X.,Gould warp thy soul to their unjust decree.
8521,X.,"So much thy foes thy manly mind mistook,"
8522,X.,Who judged it by the mildness of thy look:
8523,X.,Like a well-temper'd sword it bent at will;
8524,X.,But kept the native toughness of the steel.
8525,X.,
8526,XI.,XI.
8527,XI.,
8528,XI.,"Be true, O Clio, to thy hero's name!"
8529,XI.,"But draw him strictly so,"
8530,XI.,That all who view the piece may know.
8531,XI.,He needs no trappings of fictitious fame:
8532,XI.,The load's too weighty: thou mayest choose
8533,XI.,"Some parts of praise, and some refuse:"
8534,XI.,"Write, that his annals may be thought more lavish than the Muse."
8535,XI.,In scanty truth thou hast confined
8536,XI.,"The virtues of a royal mind,"
8537,XI.,"Forgiving, bounteous, humble, just, and kind:"
8538,XI.,"His conversation, wit, and parts,"
8539,XI.,"His knowledge in the noblest useful arts,"
8540,XI.,"Were such, dead authors could not give;"
8541,XI.,But habitudes of those who live;
8542,XI.,"Who, lighting him, did greater lights receive:"
8543,XI.,"He drain'd from all, and all they knew;"
8544,XI.,"His apprehension quick, his judgment true:"
8545,XI.,"That the most learn'd, with shame, confess"
8546,XI.,"His knowledge more, his reading only less."
8547,XI.,
8548,XII.,XII.
8549,XII.,
8550,XII.,"Amidst the peaceful triumphs of his reign,"
8551,XII.,What wonder if the kindly beams he shed
8552,XII.,Revived the drooping Arts again;
8553,XII.,"If Science raised her head,"
8554,XII.,"And soft Humanity, that from rebellion fled!"
8555,XII.,"Our isle, indeed, too fruitful was before;"
8556,XII.,But all uncultivated lay
8557,XII.,Out of the solar walk and Heaven's highway;
8558,XII.,"With rank Geneva weeds run o'er,"
8559,XII.,"And cockle, at the best, amidst the corn it bore."
8560,XII.,"The royal husbandman appear'd,"
8561,XII.,"And plough'd, and sow'd, and till'd;"
8562,XII.,"The thorns he rooted out, the rubbish clear'd,"
8563,XII.,And bless'd the obedient field:
8564,XII.,When straight a double harvest rose;
8565,XII.,Such as the swarthy Indian mows;
8566,XII.,"Or happier climates near the line,"
8567,XII.,Or Paradise manured and dress'd by hands divine.
8568,XII.,
8569,XIII.,XIII.
8570,XIII.,
8571,XIII.,"As when the new-born Phoenix takes his way,"
8572,XIII.,"His rich paternal regions to survey,"
8573,XIII.,Of airy choristers a numerous train
8574,XIII.,Attends his wondrous progress o'er the plain;
8575,XIII.,"So, rising from his father's urn,"
8576,XIII.,So glorious did our Charles return;
8577,XIII.,The officious Muses came along--
8578,XIII.,"A gay harmonious quire, like angels ever young:"
8579,XIII.,"The Muse that mourns him now, his happy triumph sung,"
8580,XIII.,Even they could thrive in his auspicious reign;
8581,XIII.,And such a plenteous crop they bore
8582,XIII.,"Of purest and well-winnow'd grain,"
8583,XIII.,As Britain never knew before.
8584,XIII.,"Though little was their hire, and light their gain,"
8585,XIII.,Yet somewhat to their share he threw;
8586,XIII.,"Fed from his hand, they sung and flew,"
8587,XIII.,Like birds of Paradise that lived on morning dew.
8588,XIII.,"Oh, never let their lays his name forget!"
8589,XIII.,The pension of a prince's praise is great.
8590,XIII.,"Live, then, thou great encourager of arts!"
8591,XIII.,Live ever in our thankful hearts;
8592,XIII.,"Live blest above, almost invoked below;"
8593,XIII.,"Live and receive this pious vow,"
8594,XIII.,"Our patron once, our guardian angel now!"
8595,XIII.,"Thou Fabius of a sinking state,"
8596,XIII.,"Who didst by wise delays divert our fate,"
8597,XIII.,"When faction like a tempest rose,"
8598,XIII.,"In death's most hideous form,"
8599,XIII.,"Then art to rage thou didst oppose,"
8600,XIII.,To weather-out the storm:
8601,XIII.,"Not quitting thy supreme command,"
8602,XIII.,"Thou held'st the rudder with a steady hand,"
8603,XIII.,Till safely on the shore the bark did land:
8604,XIII.,"The bark that all our blessings brought,"
8605,XIII.,"Charged with thyself and James, a doubly royal fraught."
8606,XIII.,
8607,XIV.,XIV.
8608,XIV.,
8609,XIV.,"Oh, frail estate of human things,"
8610,XIV.,And slippery hopes below!
8611,XIV.,"Now to our cost your emptiness we know,"
8612,XIV.,"For 'tis a lesson dearly bought,"
8613,XIV.,Assurance here is never to be sought.
8614,XIV.,"The best, and best beloved of kings,"
8615,XIV.,"And best deserving to be so,"
8616,XIV.,When scarce he had escaped the fatal blow
8617,XIV.,"Of faction and conspiracy,"
8618,XIV.,Death did his promised hopes destroy:
8619,XIV.,"He toil'd, he gain'd, but lived not to enjoy."
8620,XIV.,"What mists of Providence are these,"
8621,XIV.,Through which we cannot see!
8622,XIV.,"So saints, by supernatural power set free,"
8623,XIV.,Are left at last in martyrdom to die;
8624,XIV.,Such is the end of oft-repeated miracles.
8625,XIV.,"Forgive me, Heaven, that impious thought!"
8626,XIV.,"'Twas grief for Charles, to madness wrought,"
8627,XIV.,That question'd thy supreme decree.
8628,XIV.,"Thou didst his gracious reign prolong,"
8629,XIV.,"Even in thy saints' and angels' wrong,"
8630,XIV.,His fellow-citizens of immortality:
8631,XIV.,"For twelve long years of exile borne,"
8632,XIV.,Twice twelve we number'd since his blest return:
8633,XIV.,"So strictly wert thou just to pay,"
8634,XIV.,Even to the driblet of a day.
8635,XIV.,"Yet still we murmur and complain,"
8636,XIV.,The quails and manna should no longer rain;
8637,XIV.,Those miracles 'twas needless to renew;
8638,XIV.,The chosen stock has now the promised land in view.
8639,XIV.,
8640,XV.,XV.
8641,XV.,
8642,XV.,"A warlike prince ascends the regal state,"

8645,XV.,"Heroes in Heaven's peculiar mould are cast,"
8646,XV.,They and their poets are not form'd in haste;
8647,XV.,"Man was the first in God's design, and man was made the last."
8648,XV.,"False heroes, made by flattery so,"
8649,XV.,"Heaven can strike out, like sparkles, at a blow;"
8650,XV.,"But ere a prince is to perfection brought,"
8651,XV.,He costs Omnipotence a second thought.
8652,XV.,"With toil and sweat,"
8653,XV.,"With hardening cold, and forming heat,"
8654,XV.,"The Cyclops did their strokes repeat,"
8655,XV.,Before the impenetrable shield was wrought.
8656,XV.,It looks as if the Maker would not own

8661,XVI.,
8662,XVI.,"View, then, a monarch ripen'd for a throne!"
8663,XVI.,"Alcides thus his race began,"
8664,XVI.,O'er infancy he swiftly ran;
8665,XVI.,The future god at first was more than man:
8666,XVI.,"Dangers and toils, and Juno's hate,"
8667,XVI.,Even o'er his cradle lay in wait;
8668,XVI.,And there he grappled first with fate:
8669,XVI.,"In his young hands the hissing snakes he press'd,"
8670,XVI.,So early was the deity confess'd.
8671,XVI.,Thus by degrees he rose to Jove's imperial seat;
8672,XVI.,Thus difficulties prove a soul legitimately great.
8673,XVI.,"Like his, our hero's infancy was tried;"
8674,XVI.,Betimes the Furies did their snakes provide;
8675,XVI.,And to his infant arms oppose
8676,XVI.,"His father's rebels, and his brother's foes;"
8677,XVI.,"The more oppress'd, the higher still he rose:"
8678,XVI.,"Those were the preludes of his fate,"

8683,XVII.,
8684,XVII.,"As after Numa's peaceful reign,"

8686,XVII.,"Furbish'd the rusty sword again,"
8687,XVII.,"Resumed the long-forgotten shield,"
8688,XVII.,And led the Latins to the dusty field;
8689,XVII.,So James the drowsy genius wakes
8690,XVII.,"Of Britain, long entranced in charms,"
8691,XVII.,Restive and slumbering on its arms:
8692,XVII.,"'Tis roused, and with a new-strung nerve, the spear already shakes,"

8696,XVII.,"His voice, his sole appearance makes them bold."
8697,XVII.,Gaul and Batavia dread the impending blow;
8698,XVII.,Too well the vigour of that arm they know;
8699,XVII.,"They lick the dust, and crouch beneath their fatal foe."
8700,XVII.,"Long may they fear this awful prince,"
8701,XVII.,And not provoke his lingering sword;
8702,XVII.,"Peace is their only sure defence,"

8704,XVII.,"In all the changes of his doubtful state,"
8705,XVII.,"His truth, like Heaven's, was kept inviolate,"
8706,XVII.,For him to promise is to make it fate.

8720,XVIII.,"Let them not still be obstinately blind,"
8721,XVIII.,"Still to divert the good thou hast design'd,"
8722,XVIII.,"Or with malignant penury,"

8724,XVIII.,"Faith is a Christian's and a subject's test,"

8826,PREFACE.,"The nation is in too high a ferment for me to expect either fair war, or"
8827,PREFACE.,"even so much as fair quarter, from a reader of the opposite party. All"
8828,PREFACE.,men are engaged either on this side or that; and though conscience is
8829,PREFACE.,"the common word, which is given by both, yet if a writer fall among"
8830,PREFACE.,"enemies, and cannot give the marks of _their_ conscience, he is knocked"
8831,PREFACE.,"down before the reasons of his own are heard. A preface, therefore,"
8832,PREFACE.,"which is but a bespeaking of favour, is altogether useless. What I"
8833,PREFACE.,"desire the reader should know concerning me, he will find in the body of"
8834,PREFACE.,"the poem, if he have but the patience to peruse it. Only this"
8835,PREFACE.,"advertisement let him take beforehand, which relates to the merits of"
8836,PREFACE.,the cause. No general characters of parties (call them either Sects or
8837,PREFACE.,"Churches) can be so fully and exactly drawn, as to comprehend all the"
8838,PREFACE.,several members of them; at least all such as are received under that
8839,PREFACE.,"denomination. For example, there are some of the Church by law"
8840,PREFACE.,"established, who envy not liberty of conscience to Dissenters, as being"
8841,PREFACE.,"well satisfied that, according to their own principles, they ought not"
8842,PREFACE.,"to persecute them. Yet these, by reason of their fewness, I could not"
8843,PREFACE.,"distinguish from the numbers of the rest, with whom they are embodied in"
8844,PREFACE.,"one common name. On the other side, there are many of our sects, and"
8845,PREFACE.,"more indeed than I could reasonably have hoped, who have withdrawn"
8846,PREFACE.,"themselves from the communion of the Panther, and embraced this gracious"
8847,PREFACE.,indulgence of his Majesty in point of toleration. But neither to the one
8848,PREFACE.,nor the other of these is this satire any way intended: it is aimed only
8849,PREFACE.,at the refractory and disobedient on either side. For those who are come
8850,PREFACE.,over to the royal party are consequently supposed to be out of gun-shot.
8851,PREFACE.,"Our physicians have observed, that, in process of time, some diseases"
8852,PREFACE.,"have abated of their virulence, and have in a manner worn out their"
8853,PREFACE.,"malignity, so as to be no longer mortal; and why may not I suppose the"
8854,PREFACE.,same concerning some of those who have formerly been enemies to kingly
8855,PREFACE.,"government, as well as Catholic religion? I hope they have now another"
8856,PREFACE.,"notion of both, as having found, by comfortable experience, that the"
8857,PREFACE.,doctrine of persecution is far from being an article of our faith.
8858,PREFACE.,
8859,PREFACE.,It is not for any private man to censure the proceedings of a foreign
8860,PREFACE.,"prince; but, without suspicion of flattery, I may praise our own, who"
8861,PREFACE.,"has taken contrary measures, and those more suitable to the spirit of"
8862,PREFACE.,"Christianity. Some of the Dissenters, in their addresses to his Majesty,"
8863,PREFACE.,"have said, ""that he has restored God to his empire over conscience."" I"
8864,PREFACE.,confess I dare not stretch the figure to so great a boldness; but I may
8865,PREFACE.,"safely say, that conscience is the royalty and prerogative of every"
8866,PREFACE.,"private man. He is absolute in his own breast, and accountable to no"
8867,PREFACE.,"earthly power, for that which passes only betwixt God and him. Those who"
8868,PREFACE.,"are driven into the fold are, generally speaking, rather made hypocrites"
8869,PREFACE.,than converts.
8870,PREFACE.,
8871,PREFACE.,"This indulgence being granted to all the sects, it ought in reason to be"
8872,PREFACE.,"expected, that they should both receive it, and receive it thankfully."
8873,PREFACE.,"For, at this time of day, to refuse the benefit, and adhere to those"
8874,PREFACE.,"whom they have esteemed their persecutors, what is it else, but publicly"
8875,PREFACE.,"to own, that they suffered not before for conscience-sake, but only out"
8876,PREFACE.,"of pride and obstinacy, to separate from a church for those impositions,"
8877,PREFACE.,which they now judge may be lawfully obeyed? After they have so long
8878,PREFACE.,contended for their classical ordination (not to speak of rites and
8879,PREFACE.,ceremonies) will they at length submit to an episcopal? If they can go
8880,PREFACE.,"so far, out of complaisance to their old enemies, methinks a little"
8881,PREFACE.,"reason should persuade them to take another step, and see whither that"
8882,PREFACE.,would lead them.
8883,PREFACE.,
8884,PREFACE.,"Of the receiving this toleration thankfully I shall say no more, than"
8885,PREFACE.,"that they ought, and I doubt not they will consider from what hand they"
8886,PREFACE.,"received it. It is not from a Cyrus, a heathen prince, and a foreigner,"
8887,PREFACE.,"but from a Christian king, their native sovereign; who expects a return"
8888,PREFACE.,"in specie from them, that the kindness, which he has graciously shown"
8889,PREFACE.,"them, may be retaliated on those of his own persuasion."
8890,PREFACE.,
8891,PREFACE.,"As for the poem in general, I will only thus far satisfy the reader,"
8892,PREFACE.,"that it was neither imposed on me, nor so much as the subject given me"
8893,PREFACE.,"by any man. It was written during the last winter, and the beginning of"
8894,PREFACE.,this spring; though with long interruptions of ill health and other
8895,PREFACE.,"hindrances. About a fortnight before I had finished it, his Majesty's"
8896,PREFACE.,"declaration for liberty of conscience came abroad; which, if I had so"
8897,PREFACE.,"soon expected, I might have spared myself the labour of writing many"
8898,PREFACE.,things which are contained in the third part of it. But I was always in
8899,PREFACE.,"some hope, that the Church of England might have been persuaded to have"
8900,PREFACE.,"taken off the penal laws and the test, which was one design of the poem,"
8901,PREFACE.,when I proposed to myself the writing of it.
8902,PREFACE.,
8903,PREFACE.,"It is evident that some part of it was only occasional, and not first"
8904,PREFACE.,"intended: I mean that defence of myself, to which every honest man is"
8905,PREFACE.,"bound, when he is injuriously attacked in print; and I refer myself to"
8906,PREFACE.,the judgment of those who have read the Answer to the Defence of the
8907,PREFACE.,"late King's Papers, and that of the Duchess (in which last I was"
8908,PREFACE.,"concerned), how charitably I have been represented there. I am now"
8909,PREFACE.,"informed both of the author and supervisors of this pamphlet, and will"
8910,PREFACE.,"reply, when I think he can affront me; for I am of Socrates's opinion,"
8911,PREFACE.,that all creatures cannot. In the mean time let him consider whether he
8912,PREFACE.,"deserved not a more severe reprehension than I gave him formerly, for"
8913,PREFACE.,using so little respect to the memory of those whom he pretended to
8914,PREFACE.,"answer; and at his leisure, look out for some original treatise of"
8915,PREFACE.,"humility, written by any Protestant in English; I believe I may say in"
8916,PREFACE.,"any other tongue: for the magnified piece of Duncomb on that subject,"
8917,PREFACE.,"which either he must mean, or none, and with which another of his"
8918,PREFACE.,"fellows has upbraided me, was translated from the Spanish of Rodriguez;"
8919,PREFACE.,"though with the omission of the seventeenth, the twenty-fourth, the"
8920,PREFACE.,"twenty-fifth, and the last chapter, which will be found in comparing of"
8921,PREFACE.,the books.
8922,PREFACE.,
8923,PREFACE.,"He would have insinuated to the world, that her late Highness died not a"
8924,PREFACE.,"Roman Catholic. He declares himself to be now satisfied to the contrary,"
8925,PREFACE.,in which he has given up the cause; for matter of fact was the principal
8926,PREFACE.,"debate betwixt us. In the mean time, he would dispute the motives of her"
8927,PREFACE.,"change; how preposterously, let all men judge, when he seemed to deny"
8928,PREFACE.,"the subject of the controversy, the change itself. And because I would"
8929,PREFACE.,"not take up this ridiculous challenge, he tells the world I cannot"
8930,PREFACE.,"argue: but he may as well infer, that a Catholic cannot fast, because he"
8931,PREFACE.,"will not take up the cudgels against Mrs James, to confute the"
8932,PREFACE.,Protestant religion.
8933,PREFACE.,
8934,PREFACE.,"I have but one word more to say concerning the poem as such, and"
8935,PREFACE.,"abstracting from the matters, either religious or civil, which are"
8936,PREFACE.,"handled in it. The first part, consisting most in general characters and"
8937,PREFACE.,"narration, I have endeavoured to raise, and give it the majestic turn of"
8938,PREFACE.,"heroic poesy. The second being matter of dispute, and chiefly concerning"
8939,PREFACE.,"Church authority, I was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as"
8940,PREFACE.,"possibly I could; yet not wholly neglecting the numbers, though I had"
8941,PREFACE.,"not frequent occasions for the magnificence of verse. The third, which"
8942,PREFACE.,"has more of the nature of domestic conversation, is, or ought to be,"
8943,PREFACE.,more free and familiar than the two former.
8944,PREFACE.,
8945,PREFACE.,"There are in it two episodes, or fables, which are interwoven with the"
8946,PREFACE.,"main design; so that they are properly parts of it, though they are also"
8947,PREFACE.,distinct stories of themselves. In both of these I have made use of the
8948,PREFACE.,"commonplaces of satire, whether true or false, which are urged by the"
8949,PREFACE.,members of the one Church against the other: at which I hope no reader
8950,PREFACE.,"of either party will be scandalized, because they are not of my"
8951,PREFACE.,"invention, but as old, to my knowledge, as the times of Boccace and"
8952,PREFACE.,"Chaucer on the one side, and as those of the Reformation on the other."

9131,PART I.,"His wild disorder'd walk, his haggard eyes,"
9132,PART I.,Did all the bestial citizens surprise.
9133,PART I.,"Though fear'd and hated, yet he ruled awhile,"
9134,PART I.,As captain or companion of the spoil.
9135,PART I.,Full many a year[100] his hateful head had been                    170
9136,PART I.,"For tribute paid, nor since in Cambria seen:"
9137,PART I.,"The last of all the litter 'scaped by chance,"
9138,PART I.,And from Geneva first infested France.
9139,PART I.,"Some authors thus his pedigree will trace,"
9140,PART I.,But others write him of an upstart race:
9141,PART I.,"Because of Wickliff's brood no mark he brings,"
9142,PART I.,But his innate antipathy to kings.
9143,PART I.,"These last deduce him from th' Helvetian kind,"
9144,PART I.,Who near the Leman lake his consort lined:
9145,PART I.,"That fiery Zuinglius first th' affection bred,                     180"
9146,PART I.,And meagre Calvin bless'd the nuptial bed.
9147,PART I.,"In Israel some believe him whelp'd long since,"
9148,PART I.,When the proud Sanhedrim oppress'd the prince;
9149,PART I.,"Or, since he will be Jew, derive him higher,"
9150,PART I.,When Corah with his brethren did conspire
9151,PART I.,"From Moses' hand the sovereign sway to wrest,"
9152,PART I.,And Aaron of his ephod to divest:
9153,PART I.,"Till opening earth made way for all to pass,"
9154,PART I.,And could not bear the burden of a class.
9155,PART I.,"The Fox and he came shuffled in the dark,                          190"
9156,PART I.,If ever they were stow'd in Noah's ark:
9157,PART I.,Perhaps not made; for all their barking train
9158,PART I.,The Dog (a common species) will contain.
9159,PART I.,"And some wild curs, who from their masters ran,"
9160,PART I.,"Abhorring the supremacy of man,"
9161,PART I.,In woods and caves the rebel race began.
9162,PART I.,
9163,PART I.,"O happy pair, how well have you increased!"
9164,PART I.,What ills in Church and State have you redress'd!
9165,PART I.,"With teeth untried, and rudiments of claws,"
9166,PART I.,Your first essay was on your native laws:                          200
9167,PART I.,"Those having torn with ease, and trampled down,"
9168,PART I.,"Your fangs you fasten'd on the mitred crown,"
9169,PART I.,And freed from God and monarchy your town.
9170,PART I.,"What though your native kennel[101] still be small,"
9171,PART I.,Bounded betwixt a puddle[102] and a wall;
9172,PART I.,Yet your victorious colonies are sent
9173,PART I.,Where the north ocean girds the continent.
9174,PART I.,"Quicken'd with fire below, your monsters breed"
9175,PART I.,"In fenny Holland, and in fruitful Tweed:"
9176,PART I.,"And, like the first, the last affects to be                        210"
9177,PART I.,Drawn to the dregs of a democracy.
9178,PART I.,"As, where in fields the fairy rounds are seen,"
9179,PART I.,"A rank, sour herbage rises on the green;"
9180,PART I.,"So, springing where those midnight elves advance,"
9181,PART I.,Rebellion prints the footsteps of the dance.
9182,PART I.,"Such are their doctrines, such contempt they show"
9183,PART I.,"To Heaven above and to their prince below,"
9184,PART I.,As none but traitors and blasphemers know.
9185,PART I.,"God, like the tyrant of the skies, is placed,"
9186,PART I.,"And kings, like slaves, beneath the crowd debased.                 220"
9187,PART I.,"So fulsome is their food, that flocks refuse"
9188,PART I.,"To bite, and only dogs for physic use."
9189,PART I.,"As, where the lightning runs along the ground,"
9190,PART I.,No husbandry can heal the blasting wound;
9191,PART I.,"Nor bladed grass, nor bearded corn succeeds,"
9192,PART I.,But scales of scurf and putrefaction breeds:
9193,PART I.,"Such wars, such waste, such fiery tracks of dearth"
9194,PART I.,"Their zeal has left, and such a teemless earth,"
9195,PART I.,"But, as the poisons of the deadliest kind"
9196,PART I.,Are to their own unhappy coasts confined;                          230
9197,PART I.,"As only Indian shades of sight deprive,"
9198,PART I.,And magic plants will but in Colchos thrive;
9199,PART I.,So Presbytery and pestilential zeal
9200,PART I.,Can only nourish in a commonweal.
9201,PART I.,
9202,PART I.,From Celtic woods is chased the wolfish crew;
9203,PART I.,But ah! some pity even to brutes is due:
9204,PART I.,"Their native walks methinks they might enjoy,"
9205,PART I.,Curb'd of their native malice to destroy.
9206,PART I.,"Of all the tyrannies on human kind,"
9207,PART I.,The worst is that which persecutes the mind.                       240
9208,PART I.,Let us but weigh at what offence we strike;
9209,PART I.,'Tis but because we cannot think alike.
9210,PART I.,"In punishing of this, we overthrow"
9211,PART I.,The laws of nations and of nature too.
9212,PART I.,"Beasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway,"
9213,PART I.,Where still the stronger on the weaker prey.
9214,PART I.,"Man only of a softer mould is made,"
9215,PART I.,"Not for his fellows' ruin, but their aid:"
9216,PART I.,"Created kind, beneficent, and free,"
9217,PART I.,The noble image of the Deity.                                      250
9218,PART I.,
9219,PART I.,One portion of informing fire was given
9220,PART I.,"To brutes, the inferior family of heaven:"
9221,PART I.,"The Smith Divine, as with a careless beat,                         253"
9222,PART I.,Struck out the mute creation at a heat:
9223,PART I.,"But when arrived at last to human race,"
9224,PART I.,The Godhead took a deep-considering space;
9225,PART I.,"And to distinguish man from all the rest,"
9226,PART I.,Unlock'd the sacred treasures of his breast;
9227,PART I.,"And mercy mix'd with reason did impart,"
9228,PART I.,"One to his head, the other to his heart:                           260"
9229,PART I.,"Reason to rule, and mercy to forgive;"
9230,PART I.,"The first is law, the last prerogative."
9231,PART I.,"And like his mind his outward form appear'd,"
9232,PART I.,"When, issuing naked, to the wondering herd,"
9233,PART I.,"He charm'd their eyes; and, for they loved, they fear'd:"
9234,PART I.,"Not arm'd with horns of arbitrary might,"
9235,PART I.,"Or claws to seize their furry spoils in fight,"
9236,PART I.,Or with increase of feet to o'ertake them in their flight:
9237,PART I.,"Of easy shape, and pliant every way;"
9238,PART I.,"Confessing still the softness of his clay,                         270"
9239,PART I.,And kind as kings upon their coronation day:
9240,PART I.,"With open hands, and with extended space"
9241,PART I.,"Of arms, to satisfy a large embrace."
9242,PART I.,"Thus kneaded up with milk, the new-made man"
9243,PART I.,His kingdom o'er his kindred world began:
9244,PART I.,"Till knowledge misapplied, misunderstood,"
9245,PART I.,"And pride of empire, sour'd his balmy blood."
9246,PART I.,"Then, first rebelling, his own stamp he coins;"
9247,PART I.,The murderer Cain was latent in his loins:
9248,PART I.,"And blood began its first and loudest cry,                         280"
9249,PART I.,For differing worship of the Deity.
9250,PART I.,"Thus persecution rose, and further space"
9251,PART I.,Produced the mighty hunter of his race[103].
9252,PART I.,"Not so the blessed Pan his flock increased,"
9253,PART I.,Content to fold them from the famish'd beast:
9254,PART I.,Mild were his laws; the Sheep and harmless Hind                    286
9255,PART I.,Were never of the persecuting kind.
9256,PART I.,"Such pity now the pious pastor shows,"
9257,PART I.,"Such mercy from the British Lion flows,"
9258,PART I.,That both provide protection from their foes.
9259,PART I.,
9260,PART I.,"O happy regions, Italy and Spain,"
9261,PART I.,Which never did those monsters entertain!
9262,PART I.,"The Wolf, the Bear, the Boar, can there advance"
9263,PART I.,No native claim of just inheritance.
9264,PART I.,"And self-preserving laws, severe in show,"
9265,PART I.,May guard their fences from the invading foe.
9266,PART I.,"Where birth has placed them, let them safely share"
9267,PART I.,The common benefit of vital air.
9268,PART I.,"Themselves unharmful, let them live unharm'd;"
9269,PART I.,"Their jaws disabled, and their claws disarm'd:                     300"
9270,PART I.,"Here, only in nocturnal howlings bold,"
9271,PART I.,"They dare not seize the hind, nor leap the fold."
9272,PART I.,"More powerful, and as vigilant as they,"
9273,PART I.,The Lion awfully forbids the prey.
9274,PART I.,"Their rage repress'd, though pinch'd with famine sore,"
9275,PART I.,"They stand aloof, and tremble at his roar:"
9276,PART I.,"Much is their hunger, but their fear is more."
9277,PART I.,"These are the chief: to number o'er the rest,"
9278,PART I.,"And stand, like Adam, naming every beast,"
9279,PART I.,Were weary work; nor will the muse describe                        310
9280,PART I.,A slimy-born and sun-begotten tribe;
9281,PART I.,"Who far from steeples and their sacred sound,"
9282,PART I.,In fields their sullen conventicles found.
9283,PART I.,"These gross, half-animated lumps I leave;"
9284,PART I.,Nor can I think what thoughts they can conceive.
9285,PART I.,"But if they think at all, 'tis sure no higher"
9286,PART I.,"Than matter, put in motion, may aspire:"
9287,PART I.,Souls that can scarce ferment their mass of clay;
9288,PART I.,"So drossy, so divisible are they,"
9289,PART I.,As would but serve pure bodies for allay:                          320
9290,PART I.,"Such souls as shards produce, such beetle things"
9291,PART I.,As only buzz to heaven with evening wings;
9292,PART I.,"Strike in the dark, offending but by chance,"
9293,PART I.,Such are the blindfold blows of ignorance.
9294,PART I.,"They know not beings, and but hate a name;"
9295,PART I.,To them the Hind and Panther are the same.
9296,PART I.,
9297,PART I.,"The Panther[104] sure the noblest, next the Hind,"
9298,PART I.,And fairest creature of the spotted kind;
9299,PART I.,"Oh, could her inborn stains be wash'd away,"
9300,PART I.,She were too good to be a beast of prey!                           330
9301,PART I.,"How can I praise, or blame, and not offend,"

9303,PART I.,"Her faults and virtues lie so mix'd, that she"

9305,PART I.,"Then, like her injured Lion, let me speak;"
9306,PART I.,"He cannot bend her, and he would not break."
9307,PART I.,"Unkind already, and estranged in part,"
9308,PART I.,The Wolf begins to share her wandering heart.
9309,PART I.,"Though unpolluted yet with actual ill,"
9310,PART I.,"She half commits, who sins but in her will.                        340"
9311,PART I.,"If, as our dreaming Platonists report,"
9312,PART I.,"There could be spirits of a middle sort,"
9313,PART I.,"Too black for heaven, and yet too white for hell,"
9314,PART I.,"Who just dropt half way down, nor lower fell;"
9315,PART I.,"So poised, so gently she descends from high,"
9316,PART I.,It seems a soft dismission from the sky.
9317,PART I.,"Her house not ancient, whatsoe'er pretence"
9318,PART I.,Her clergy heralds make in her defence.
9319,PART I.,"A second century not half-way run,"
9320,PART I.,Since the new honours of her blood begun.                          350
9321,PART I.,"A Lion[105] old, obscene, and furious made"
9322,PART I.,"By lust, compress'd her mother in a shade;"
9323,PART I.,"Then, by a left-hand marriage, weds the dame,"
9324,PART I.,Covering adultery with a specious name:
9325,PART I.,"So Schism begot; and Sacrilege and she,"
9326,PART I.,"A well match'd pair, got graceless Heresy."
9327,PART I.,"God's and king's rebels have the same good cause,"
9328,PART I.,To trample down divine and human laws:
9329,PART I.,"Both would be call'd reformers, and their hate"
9330,PART I.,Alike destructive both to Church and State:                        360
9331,PART I.,The fruit proclaims the plant; a lawless prince
9332,PART I.,By luxury reform'd incontinence;
9333,PART I.,"By ruins, charity; by riots, abstinence."
9334,PART I.,"Confessions, fasts, and penance set aside,"
9335,PART I.,"Oh, with what ease we follow such a guide,"
9336,PART I.,"Where souls are starved, and senses gratified!"
9337,PART I.,"Where marriage pleasures midnight prayers supply,"
9338,PART I.,"And matin bells, a melancholy cry,"
9339,PART I.,"Are tuned to merrier notes, Increase and multiply."
9340,PART I.,Religion shows a rosy-colour'd face;                               370
9341,PART I.,Not batter'd out with drudging works of grace:
9342,PART I.,A down-hill reformation rolls apace.
9343,PART I.,"What flesh and blood would crowd the narrow gate,"
9344,PART I.,"Or, till they waste their pamper'd paunches, wait?"
9345,PART I.,All would be happy at the cheapest rate.
9346,PART I.,
9347,PART I.,"Though our lean faith these rigid laws has given,"
9348,PART I.,The full-fed Mussulman goes fat to heaven;
9349,PART I.,For his Arabian prophet with delights
9350,PART I.,Of sense allured his eastern proselytes.
9351,PART I.,"The jolly Luther, reading him, began                               380"
9352,PART I.,To interpret Scriptures by his Alcoran;

9354,PART I.,And make the paths of Paradise more sweet;
9355,PART I.,"Bethought him of a wife ere half way gone,"
9356,PART I.,For 'twas uneasy travelling alone;
9357,PART I.,"And, in this masquerade of mirth and love,"
9358,PART I.,Mistook the bliss of heaven for Bacchanals above.
9359,PART I.,"Sure he presumed of praise, who came to stock"
9360,PART I.,"The ethereal pastures with so fair a flock,"
9361,PART I.,"Burnish'd, and battening on their food, to show                    390"
9362,PART I.,Their diligence of careful herds below.
9363,PART I.,"Our Panther, though like these she changed her head,"

9366,PART I.,"The crosier wielded, and the mitre wore."
9367,PART I.,Her upper part of decent discipline
9368,PART I.,Show'd affectation of an ancient line;
9369,PART I.,"And Fathers, Councils, Church, and Church's head,"
9370,PART I.,Were on her reverend phylacteries read.
9371,PART I.,"But what disgraced and disavow'd the rest,                         400"
9372,PART I.,"Was Calvin's brand, that stigmatized the beast."
9373,PART I.,"Thus, like a creature of a double kind,"
9374,PART I.,In her own labyrinth she lives confined.
9375,PART I.,"To foreign lands no sound of her is come,"
9376,PART I.,Humbly content to be despised at home.
9377,PART I.,"Such is her faith, where good cannot be had,"
9378,PART I.,At least she leaves the refuse of the bad:
9379,PART I.,"Nice in her choice of ill, though not of best,"
9380,PART I.,"And least deform'd, because reform'd the least."
9381,PART I.,"In doubtful points betwixt her differing friends,                  410"
9382,PART I.,"Where one for substance, one for sign contends,"
9383,PART I.,Their contradicting terms she strives to join;
9384,PART I.,"Sign shall be substance, substance shall be sign."
9385,PART I.,"A real presence all her sons allow,"
9386,PART I.,"And yet 'tis flat idolatry to bow,"
9387,PART I.,Because the Godhead's there they know not how.
9388,PART I.,Her novices are taught that bread and wine
9389,PART I.,"Are but the visible and outward sign,"
9390,PART I.,Received by those who in communion join.
9391,PART I.,"But the inward grace, or the thing signified,                      420"
9392,PART I.,"His blood and body, who to save us died;"
9393,PART I.,The faithful this thing signified receive:
9394,PART I.,What is't those faithful then partake or leave?
9395,PART I.,"For what is signified and understood,"
9396,PART I.,"Is, by her own confession, flesh and blood."
9397,PART I.,"Then, by the same acknowledgment, we know"

9399,PART I.,"The literal sense is hard to flesh and blood,"
9400,PART I.,But nonsense never can be understood.
9401,PART I.,
9402,PART I.,Her wild belief on every wave is toss'd;                         430
9403,PART I.,But sure no Church can better morals boast:
9404,PART I.,True to her king her principles are found;
9405,PART I.,O that her practice were but half so sound!
9406,PART I.,"Steadfast in various turns of state she stood,"
9407,PART I.,And seal'd her vow'd affection with her blood:
9408,PART I.,"Nor will I meanly tax her constancy,"
9409,PART I.,That interest or obligement made the tie
9410,PART I.,Bound to the fate of murder'd monarchy.
9411,PART I.,"Before the sounding axe so falls the vine,"
9412,PART I.,Whose tender branches round the poplar twine.                      440
9413,PART I.,"She chose her ruin, and resign'd her life,"

9415,PART I.,A rare example! but some souls we see
9416,PART I.,"Grow hard, and stiffen with adversity:"
9417,PART I.,Yet these by fortune's favours are undone;
9418,PART I.,"Resolved into a baser form they run,"

9424,PART I.,
9425,PART I.,"Fierce to her foes, yet fears her force to try,"

9428,PART I.,Who has herself cast off the lawful sway?
9429,PART I.,"Rebellion equals all, and those who toil"
9430,PART I.,"In common theft, will share the common spoil."

9433,PART I.,"If she reform by text, even that's as plain                        460"

9435,PART I.,"As long as words a different sense will bear,"
9436,PART I.,"And each may be his own interpreter,"
9437,PART I.,Our airy faith will no foundation find:
9438,PART I.,The word's a weathercock for every wind:

9440,PART I.,The most in power supplies the present gale.
9441,PART I.,The wretched Panther cries aloud for aid
9442,PART I.,"To Church and Councils, whom she first betray'd;"
9443,PART I.,No help from Fathers or Tradition's train:                         470
9444,PART I.,"Those ancient guides she taught us to disdain,"
9445,PART I.,"And, by that Scripture, which she once abused"

9449,PART I.,"And, after all her winding ways are tried,"
9450,PART I.,"If doubts arise, she slips herself aside,"
9451,PART I.,And leaves the private conscience for the guide.
9452,PART I.,"If then that conscience set the offender free,"
9453,PART I.,It bars her claim to Church authority.                             480
9454,PART I.,"How can she censure, or what crime pretend,"
9455,PART I.,But Scripture may be construed to defend?
9456,PART I.,"Even those, whom for rebellion she transmits 483"
9457,PART I.,"To civil power, her doctrine first acquits;"
9458,PART I.,"Because no disobedience can ensue,"
9459,PART I.,Where no submission to a judge is due;
9460,PART I.,"Each judging for himself, by her consent,"
9461,PART I.,Whom thus absolved she sends to punishment.
9462,PART I.,"Suppose the magistrate revenge her cause,"
9463,PART I.,'Tis only for transgressing human laws. 490
9464,PART I.,"How answering to its end a Church is made,"

9466,PART I.,"Oh, solid rock, on which secure she stands!"
9467,PART I.,"Eternal house, not built with mortal hands!"
9468,PART I.,"Oh, sure defence against the infernal gate,--"
9469,PART I.,A patent during pleasure of the state!
9470,PART I.,
9471,PART I.,"Thus is the Panther neither loved nor fear'd,"
9472,PART I.,A mere mock queen of a divided herd;
9473,PART I.,"Whom soon by lawful power she might control,"
9474,PART I.,Herself a part submitted to the whole. 500
9475,PART I.,"Then, as the moon who first receives the light"

9478,PART I.,The rays she borrow'd from a better star;
9479,PART I.,"Big with the beams which from her mother flow,"
9480,PART I.,And reigning o'er the rising tides below:
9481,PART I.,"Now, mixing with a savage crowd, she goes,"
9482,PART I.,And meanly flatters her inveterate foes;
9483,PART I.,"Ruled while she rules, and losing every hour"
9484,PART I.,Her wretched remnants of precarious power. 510
9485,PART I.,
9486,PART I.,"One evening, while the cooler shade she sought,"
9487,PART I.,"Revolving many a melancholy thought,"
9488,PART I.,"Alone she walk'd, and look'd around in vain,"
9489,PART I.,"With rueful visage, for her vanish'd train:"
9490,PART I.,None of her sylvan subjects made their court;
9491,PART I.,Levées and couchées pass'd without resort.
9492,PART I.,So hardly can usurpers manage well                                 517
9493,PART I.,Those whom they first instructed to rebel.
9494,PART I.,More liberty begets desire of more;
9495,PART I.,The hunger still increases with the store.
9496,PART I.,"Without respect they brush'd along the wood,"
9497,PART I.,"Each in his clan, and, fill'd with loathsome food,"
9498,PART I.,Ask'd no permission to the neighbouring flood.
9499,PART I.,"The Panther, full of inward discontent,"
9500,PART I.,"Since they would go, before them wisely went;"
9501,PART I.,"Supplying want of power by drinking first,"
9502,PART I.,As if she gave them leave to quench their thirst.
9503,PART I.,"Among the rest, the Hind, with fearful face,"
9504,PART I.,"Beheld from far the common watering place,"
9505,PART I.,"Nor durst approach; till, with an awful roar,                      530"
9506,PART I.,The sovereign Lion[107] bade her fear no more.
9507,PART I.,"Encouraged thus she brought her younglings nigh,"
9508,PART I.,"Watching the motions of her patron's eye,"
9509,PART I.,And drank a sober draught; the rest amazed
9510,PART I.,"Stood mutely still, and on the stranger gazed;"
9511,PART I.,"Survey'd her part by part, and sought to find"
9512,PART I.,"The ten-horn'd monster in the harmless Hind,"
9513,PART I.,Such as the Wolf and Panther had design'd.
9514,PART I.,They thought at first they dream'd; for 'twas offence
9515,PART I.,"With them to question certitude of sense,                          540"
9516,PART I.,"Their guide in faith: but nearer when they drew,"
9517,PART I.,"And had the faultless object full in view,"
9518,PART I.,"Lord, how they all admired her heavenly hue!"
9519,PART I.,"Some, who before her fellowship disdain'd,"
9520,PART I.,"Scarce, and but scarce, from in-born rage restrain'd,"
9521,PART I.,"Now frisk'd about her, and old kindred feign'd."
9522,PART I.,"Whether for love or interest, every sect"
9523,PART I.,Of all the savage nation show'd respect.
9524,PART I.,The viceroy Panther could not awe the herd;                        549
9525,PART I.,"The more the company, the less they fear'd."
9526,PART I.,"The surly Wolf with secret envy burst,"
9527,PART I.,Yet could not howl; (the Hind had seen him first:)
9528,PART I.,But what he durst not speak the Panther durst.
9529,PART I.,
9530,PART I.,"For when the herd, sufficed, did late repair,"
9531,PART I.,"To ferny heaths, and to their forest lair,"
9532,PART I.,"She made a mannerly excuse to stay,"
9533,PART I.,Proffering the Hind to wait her half the way:
9534,PART I.,"That, since the sky was clear, an hour of talk"
9535,PART I.,Might help her to beguile the tedious walk.
9536,PART I.,"With much good-will the motion was embraced,                       560"
9537,PART I.,To chat a while on their adventures pass'd:
9538,PART I.,Nor had the grateful Hind so soon forgot
9539,PART I.,Her friend and fellow-sufferer in the Plot.
9540,PART I.,"Yet, wondering how of late she grew estranged,"
9541,PART I.,"Her forehead cloudy, and her countenance changed,"
9542,PART I.,She thought this hour the occasion would present
9543,PART I.,"To learn her secret cause of discontent,"
9544,PART I.,"Which well she hoped might be with ease redress'd,"
9545,PART I.,"Considering her a well-bred civil beast,"
9546,PART I.,And more a gentlewoman than the rest.                              570
9547,PART I.,"After some common talk what rumours ran,"
9548,PART I.,The lady of the spotted muff began.

9588,PART II.,"Dame, said the Panther, times are mended well,"

9590,PART II.,"The toils were pitch'd, a spacious tract of ground"
9591,PART II.,With expert huntsmen was encompass'd round;
9592,PART II.,The enclosure narrow'd; the sagacious power                          5
9593,PART II.,Of hounds and death drew nearer every hour.
9594,PART II.,"'Tis true, the younger Lion[109] 'scaped the snare,"

9596,PART II.,As sacrifices on their altar laid;
9597,PART II.,"While you, their careful mother, wisely fled,                       10"
9598,PART II.,Not trusting destiny to save your head;
9599,PART II.,"For, whate'er promises you have applied"
9600,PART II.,"To your unfailing Church, the surer side"
9601,PART II.,Is four fair legs in danger to provide.
9602,PART II.,"And whate'er tales of Peter's chair you tell,"

9604,PART II.,The better luck was yours to 'scape so well.
9605,PART II.,
9606,PART II.,"As I remember, said the sober Hind,"

9608,PART II.,"As well as me, and with the self-same throw,                        20"
9609,PART II.,To catch the quarry and the vermin too.
9610,PART II.,(Forgive the slanderous tongues that call'd you so.)
9611,PART II.,"Howe'er you take it now, the common cry"
9612,PART II.,Then ran you down for your rank loyalty.
9613,PART II.,"Besides, in Popery they thought you nursed,"
9614,PART II.,"As evil tongues will ever speak the worst,"
9615,PART II.,"Because some forms, and ceremonies some"
9616,PART II.,"You kept, and stood in the main question dumb."
9617,PART II.,Dumb you were born indeed; but thinking long
9618,PART II.,The Test[111] it seems at last has loosed your tongue.              30
9619,PART II.,"And to explain what your forefathers meant,"
9620,PART II.,"By real presence in the sacrament,"

9630,PART II.,Yet in your sense I never own'd it there.
9631,PART II.,"A real virtue we by faith receive,"
9632,PART II.,And that we in the sacrament believe.
9633,PART II.,"Then, said the Hind, as you the matter state,"
9634,PART II.,Not only Jesuits can equivocate;
9635,PART II.,"For real, as you now the word expound,"
9636,PART II.,From solid substance dwindles to a sound.
9637,PART II.,Methinks an Æsop's fable you repeat;
9638,PART II.,You know who took the shadow for the meat:
9639,PART II.,"Your Church's substance thus you change at will,                    50"
9640,PART II.,And yet retain your former figure still.
9641,PART II.,I freely grant you spoke to save your life;
9642,PART II.,For then you lay beneath the butcher's knife.
9643,PART II.,"Long time you fought, redoubled battery bore,"
9644,PART II.,"But, after all, against yourself you swore;"
9645,PART II.,Your former self: for every hour your form
9646,PART II.,"Is chopp'd and changed, like winds before a storm."
9647,PART II.,Thus fear and interest will prevail with some;

9650,PART II.,"The Panther grinn'd at this, and thus replied:                    60"
9651,PART II.,That men may err was never yet denied.

9661,PART II.,"Suppose (though I disown it), said the Hind,                        70"
9662,PART II.,The certain mansion were not yet assign'd;
9663,PART II.,The doubtful residence no proof can bring
9664,PART II.,Against the plain existence of the thing.
9665,PART II.,Because philosophers may disagree
9666,PART II.,"If sight by emission or reception be,"
9667,PART II.,"Shall it be thence inferr'd, I do not see?"
9668,PART II.,"But you require an answer positive,"
9669,PART II.,"Which yet, when I demand, you dare not give;"
9670,PART II.,For fallacies in universals live.
9671,PART II.,I then affirm that this unfailing guide                             80
9672,PART II.,In Pope and General Councils must reside;
9673,PART II.,"Both lawful, both combined: what one decrees"
9674,PART II.,"By numerous votes, the other ratifies:"
9675,PART II.,On this undoubted sense the Church relies.
9676,PART II.,"'Tis true, some doctors in a scantier space,"
9677,PART II.,"I mean, in each apart, contract the place."
9678,PART II.,"Some, who to greater length extend the line,"
9679,PART II.,The Church's after-acceptation join.
9680,PART II.,This last circumference appears too wide;
9681,PART II.,The Church diffused is by the Council tied;                         90
9682,PART II.,As members by their representatives
9683,PART II.,Obliged to laws which Prince and Senate gives.
9684,PART II.,"Thus some contract, and some enlarge the space:"
9685,PART II.,"In Pope and Council, who denies the place,"
9686,PART II.,Assisted from above with God's unfailing grace?
9687,PART II.,Those canons all the needful points contain;
9688,PART II.,"Their sense so obvious, and their words so plain,"
9689,PART II.,That no disputes about the doubtful text
9690,PART II.,Have hitherto the labouring world perplex'd.
9691,PART II.,"If any should in after-times appear,                               100"
9692,PART II.,"New Councils must be call'd, to make the meaning clear:"
9693,PART II.,Because in them the power supreme resides;
9694,PART II.,And all the promises are to the guides.
9695,PART II.,This may be taught with sound and safe defence;
9696,PART II.,"But mark how sandy is your own pretence,"
9697,PART II.,"Who, setting Councils, Pope, and Church aside,"
9698,PART II.,Are every man his own presuming guide.
9699,PART II.,"The Sacred Books, you say, are full and plain."
9700,PART II.,And every needful point of truth contain:
9701,PART II.,All who can read interpreters may be:                              110
9702,PART II.,"Thus, though your several Churches disagree,"
9703,PART II.,Yet every saint has to himself alone
9704,PART II.,The secret of this philosophic stone.
9705,PART II.,"These principles your jarring sects unite,"
9706,PART II.,When differing doctors and disciples fight.
9707,PART II.,"Though Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, holy chiefs,"
9708,PART II.,Have made a battle royal of beliefs;
9709,PART II.,"Or, like wild horses, several ways have whirl'd"
9710,PART II.,The tortured text about the Christian world;
9711,PART II.,"Each Jehu lashing on with furious force,                           120"
9712,PART II.,That Turk or Jew could not have used it worse;
9713,PART II.,"No matter what dissension leaders make,"
9714,PART II.,Where every private man may save a stake:
9715,PART II.,"Ruled by the Scripture and his own advice,"
9716,PART II.,Each has a blind by-path to Paradise;
9717,PART II.,"Where, driving in a circle, slow or fast,"
9718,PART II.,Opposing sects are sure to meet at last.
9719,PART II.,A wondrous charity you have in store
9720,PART II.,For all reform'd to pass the narrow door:
9721,PART II.,"So much, that Mahomet had scarcely more.                           130"
9722,PART II.,"For he, kind prophet, was for damning none;"
9723,PART II.,But Christ and Moses were to save their own:
9724,PART II.,"Himself was to secure his chosen race,"
9725,PART II.,"Though reason good for Turks to take the place,"
9726,PART II.,"And he allow'd to be the better man,"
9727,PART II.,In virtue of his holier Alcoran.
9728,PART II.,
9729,PART II.,"True, said the Panther, I shall ne'er deny"
9730,PART II.,My brethren may be saved as well as I:
9731,PART II.,"Though Huguenots condemn our ordination,"
9732,PART II.,"Succession, ministerial vocation;                                  140"
9733,PART II.,"And Luther, more mistaking what he read,"
9734,PART II.,Misjoins the sacred body with the bread:
9735,PART II.,"Yet, lady, still remember, I maintain,"
9736,PART II.,The Word in needful points is only plain.
9737,PART II.,
9738,PART II.,"Needless, or needful, I not now contend,"
9739,PART II.,For still you have a loop-hole for a friend;
9740,PART II.,Rejoin'd the matron: but the rule you lay
9741,PART II.,"Has led whole flocks, and leads them still astray,"
9742,PART II.,"In weighty points, and full damnation's way."
9743,PART II.,"For did not Arius first, Socinus now,                              150"
9744,PART II.,The Son's Eternal Godhead disavow?
9745,PART II.,And did not these by gospel texts alone
9746,PART II.,"Condemn our doctrine, and maintain their own?"
9747,PART II.,Have not all heretics the same pretence
9748,PART II.,To plead the Scriptures in their own defence?
9749,PART II.,How did the Nicene Council then decide
9750,PART II.,That strong debate? was it by Scripture tried?
9751,PART II.,"No, sure; to that the rebel would not yield;"
9752,PART II.,Squadrons of texts he marshall'd in the field:
9753,PART II.,"That was but civil war, an equal set,                              160"
9754,PART II.,"Where piles with piles[112], and eagles eagles met."
9755,PART II.,With texts point-blank and plain he faced the foe.
9756,PART II.,And did not Satan tempt our Saviour so?
9757,PART II.,The good old bishops took a simpler way;
9758,PART II.,"Each ask'd but what he heard his father say,"
9759,PART II.,"Or how he was instructed in his youth,"
9760,PART II.,And by tradition's force upheld the truth.
9761,PART II.,
9762,PART II.,"The Panther smiled at this; and when, said she,"
9763,PART II.,Were those first Councils disallow'd by me?
9764,PART II.,"Or where did I at sure Tradition strike,                           170"
9765,PART II.,Provided still it were apostolic?
9766,PART II.,
9767,PART II.,"Friend, said the Hind, you quit your former ground,"
9768,PART II.,Where all your faith you did on Scripture found:
9769,PART II.,Now 'tis Tradition join'd with Holy Writ;
9770,PART II.,But thus your memory betrays your wit.
9771,PART II.,
9772,PART II.,"No, said the Panther, for in that I view,"
9773,PART II.,"When your tradition's forged, and when 'tis true."
9774,PART II.,"I set them by the rule, and, as they square,"
9775,PART II.,"Or deviate from, undoubted doctrine there,"
9776,PART II.,"This oral fiction, that old faith declare.                         180"
9777,PART II.,
9778,PART II.,"Hind: The Council steer'd, it seems, a different course;"
9779,PART II.,They tried the Scripture by Tradition's force:
9780,PART II.,But you Tradition by the Scripture try;
9781,PART II.,"Pursued by sects, from this to that you fly,"
9782,PART II.,Nor dare on one foundation to rely.
9783,PART II.,"The Word is then deposed, and in this view,"
9784,PART II.,"You rule the Scripture, not the Scripture you."
9785,PART II.,"Thus said the dame, and, smiling, thus pursued:"
9786,PART II.,"I see Tradition then is disallow'd,"
9787,PART II.,"When not evinced by Scripture to be true,                          190"
9788,PART II.,"And Scripture, as interpreted by you."
9789,PART II.,But here you tread upon unfaithful ground;
9790,PART II.,Unless you could infallibly expound:
9791,PART II.,"Which you reject as odious Popery,"
9792,PART II.,And throw that doctrine back with scorn on me.
9793,PART II.,"Suppose we on things traditive divide,"
9794,PART II.,And both appeal to Scripture to decide;
9795,PART II.,"By various texts we both uphold our claim,"
9796,PART II.,"Nay, often ground our titles on the same:"
9797,PART II.,"After long labour lost, and time's expense,                        200"
9798,PART II.,"Both grant the words, and quarrel for the sense."
9799,PART II.,Thus all disputes for ever must depend;
9800,PART II.,For no dumb rule can controversies end.
9801,PART II.,"Thus, when you said, Tradition must be tried"
9802,PART II.,"By Sacred Writ, whose sense yourselves decide,"
9803,PART II.,"You said no more, but that yourselves must be"
9804,PART II.,"The judges of the Scripture sense, not we."
9805,PART II.,"Against our Church-Tradition you declare,"
9806,PART II.,And yet your clerks would sit in Moses' chair;
9807,PART II.,"At least 'tis proved against your argument,                        210"
9808,PART II.,"The rule is far from plain, where all dissent."
9809,PART II.,
9810,PART II.,"If not by Scriptures, how can we be sure,"
9811,PART II.,"Replied the Panther, what Tradition's pure?"
9812,PART II.,For you may palm upon us new for old:
9813,PART II.,"All, as they say, that glitters, is not gold."
9814,PART II.,
9815,PART II.,"How but by following her, replied the dame,"
9816,PART II.,To whom derived from sire to son they came;
9817,PART II.,"Where every age does on another move,"
9818,PART II.,And trusts no farther than the next above;
9819,PART II.,"Where all the rounds like Jacob's ladder rise,                     220"
9820,PART II.,"The lowest hid in earth, the topmost in the skies."
9821,PART II.,
9822,PART II.,"Sternly the savage did her answer mark,"
9823,PART II.,"Her glowing eye-balls glittering in the dark,"
9824,PART II.,"And said but this: Since lucre was your trade,"
9825,PART II.,"Succeeding times such dreadful gaps have made,"
9826,PART II.,'Tis dangerous climbing: to your sons and you
9827,PART II.,"I leave the ladder, and its omen too."
9828,PART II.,
9829,PART II.,Hind: The Panther's breath was ever famed for sweet;
9830,PART II.,But from the Wolf such wishes oft I meet:
9831,PART II.,"You learn'd this language from the Blatant Beast,                  230"
9832,PART II.,"Or rather did not speak, but were possess'd."
9833,PART II.,"As for your answer, 'tis but barely urged:"
9834,PART II.,You must evince Tradition to be forged;
9835,PART II.,Produce plain proofs: unblemish'd authors use
9836,PART II.,As ancient as those ages they accuse;
9837,PART II.,'Till when 'tis not sufficient to defame:
9838,PART II.,"An old possession stands, 'till elder quits the claim."
9839,PART II.,"Then for our interest, which is named alone"
9840,PART II.,"To load with envy, we retort your own,"
9841,PART II.,"For when Traditions in your faces fly,                             240"
9842,PART II.,"Resolving not to yield, you must decry."
9843,PART II.,"As when the cause goes hard, the guilty man"
9844,PART II.,"Excepts, and thins his jury all he can;"
9845,PART II.,"So when you stand of other aid bereft,"
9846,PART II.,You to the Twelve Apostles would be left.
9847,PART II.,Your friend the Wolf did with more craft provide
9848,PART II.,"To set those toys, Traditions, quite aside;"
9849,PART II.,"And Fathers too, unless when, reason spent,"
9850,PART II.,He cites them but sometimes for ornament.
9851,PART II.,"But, madam Panther, you, though more sincere,                      250"
9852,PART II.,Are not so wise as your adulterer:
9853,PART II.,"The private spirit is a better blind,"
9854,PART II.,Than all the dodging tricks your authors find.
9855,PART II.,"For they, who left the Scripture to the crowd,"
9856,PART II.,Each for his own peculiar judge allow'd;
9857,PART II.,The way to please them was to make them proud.
9858,PART II.,"Thus, with full sails, they ran upon the shelf:"
9859,PART II.,Who could suspect a cozenage from himself?
9860,PART II.,"On his own reason safer 'tis to stand,"
9861,PART II.,Than be deceived and damn'd at second-hand.                        260
9862,PART II.,"But you, who Fathers and Traditions take,"
9863,PART II.,"And garble some, and some you quite forsake,"
9864,PART II.,"Pretending Church-authority to fix,"
9865,PART II.,"And yet some grains of private spirit mix,"
9866,PART II.,"Are like a mule, made up of differing seed,"
9867,PART II.,And that's the reason why you never breed;
9868,PART II.,"At least not propagate your kind abroad,"
9869,PART II.,For home dissenters are by statutes awed.
9870,PART II.,"And yet they grow upon you every day,"
9871,PART II.,"While you, to speak the best, are at a stay,                       270"
9872,PART II.,"For sects, that are extremes, abhor a middle way."
9873,PART II.,"Like tricks of state, to stop a raging flood,"
9874,PART II.,Or mollify a mad-brain'd senate's mood:
9875,PART II.,Of all expedients never one was good.
9876,PART II.,"Well may they argue, nor can you deny,"
9877,PART II.,"If we must fix on Church authority,"
9878,PART II.,"Best on the best, the fountain, not the flood;"
9879,PART II.,"That must be better still, if this be good."
9880,PART II.,Shall she command who has herself rebell'd?
9881,PART II.,Is Antichrist by Antichrist expell'd?                              280
9882,PART II.,"Did we a lawful tyranny displace,"
9883,PART II.,To set aloft a bastard of the race?
9884,PART II.,"Why all these wars to win the Book, if we"
9885,PART II.,"Must not interpret for ourselves, but she?"
9886,PART II.,"Either be wholly slaves, or wholly free."
9887,PART II.,For purging fires Traditions must not fight;
9888,PART II.,But they must prove Episcopacy's right.
9889,PART II.,Thus those led horses are from service freed;
9890,PART II.,You never mount them but in time of need.
9891,PART II.,"Like mercenaries, hired for home defence,                          290"
9892,PART II.,They will not serve against their native prince.
9893,PART II.,Against domestic foes of hierarchy
9894,PART II.,"These are drawn forth, to make fanatics fly;"
9895,PART II.,"But, when they see their countrymen at hand,"
9896,PART II.,"Marching against them under Church-command,"
9897,PART II.,"Straight they forsake their colours, and disband."
9898,PART II.,
9899,PART II.,"Thus she, nor could the Panther well enlarge"
9900,PART II.,With weak defence against so strong a charge;
9901,PART II.,"But said: For what did Christ his Word provide,"
9902,PART II.,If still his Church must want a living guide?                      300
9903,PART II.,"And if all saving doctrines are not there,"
9904,PART II.,"Or sacred penmen could not make them clear,"
9905,PART II.,From after ages we should hope in vain
9906,PART II.,"For truths, which men inspired could not explain."
9907,PART II.,
9908,PART II.,"Before the Word was written, said the Hind,"
9909,PART II.,Our Saviour preach'd his faith to human kind:
9910,PART II.,From his apostles the first age received
9911,PART II.,"Eternal truth, and what they taught believed."
9912,PART II.,Thus by Tradition faith was planted first;
9913,PART II.,Succeeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed.                       310
9914,PART II.,This was the way our wise Redeemer chose
9915,PART II.,"(Who sure could all things for the best dispose),"
9916,PART II.,To fence his fold from their encroaching foes.
9917,PART II.,"He could have writ himself, but well foresaw"
9918,PART II.,The event would be like that of Moses' law;
9919,PART II.,"Some difference would arise, some doubts remain,"
9920,PART II.,Like those which yet the jarring Jews maintain.
9921,PART II.,"No written laws can be so plain, so pure,"
9922,PART II.,"But wit may gloss, and malice may obscure;"
9923,PART II.,"Not those indited by his first command,                            320"
9924,PART II.,"A prophet graved the text, an angel held his hand."
9925,PART II.,"Thus faith was ere the written word appear'd,"
9926,PART II.,"And men believed not what they read, but heard."
9927,PART II.,But since the apostles could not be confined
9928,PART II.,"To these, or those, but severally design'd"
9929,PART II.,"Their large commission round the world to blow,"
9930,PART II.,"To spread their faith, they spread their labours too."
9931,PART II.,Yet still their absent flock their pains did share;
9932,PART II.,"They hearken'd still, for love produces care,"
9933,PART II.,"And, as mistakes arose, or discords fell,                          330"
9934,PART II.,"Or bold seducers taught them to rebel,"
9935,PART II.,"As charity grew cold, or faction hot,"
9936,PART II.,"Or long neglect their lessons had forgot,"
9937,PART II.,"For all their wants they wisely did provide,"
9938,PART II.,And preaching by epistles was supplied:
9939,PART II.,"So great physicians cannot all attend,"
9940,PART II.,"But some they visit, and to some they send."
9941,PART II.,Yet all those letters were not writ to all;
9942,PART II.,"Nor first intended but occasional,"
9943,PART II.,Their absent sermons; nor if they contain                          340
9944,PART II.,"All needful doctrines, are those doctrines plain."
9945,PART II.,Clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought:
9946,PART II.,"They writ but seldom, but they daily taught."
9947,PART II.,"And what one saint has said of holy Paul,"
9948,PART II.,"""He darkly writ,"" is true, applied to all."
9949,PART II.,For this obscurity could Heaven provide
9950,PART II.,"More prudently than by a living guide,"
9951,PART II.,"As doubts arose, the difference to decide?"
9952,PART II.,"A guide was therefore needful, therefore made;"
9953,PART II.,"And, if appointed, sure to be obey'd.                              350"
9954,PART II.,"Thus, with due reverence to the Apostle's writ,"
9955,PART II.,"By which my sons are taught, to which submit;"
9956,PART II.,"I think those truths their sacred works contain,"
9957,PART II.,The Church alone can certainly explain;
9958,PART II.,"That following ages, leaning on the past,"
9959,PART II.,May rest upon the Primitive at last.
9960,PART II.,"Nor would I thence the Word no rule infer,"
9961,PART II.,But none without the Church-interpreter.
9962,PART II.,"Because, as I have urged before, 'tis mute,"
9963,PART II.,And is itself the subject of dispute.                              360
9964,PART II.,"But what the Apostles their successors taught,"
9965,PART II.,"They to the next, from them to us is brought,"
9966,PART II.,The undoubted sense which is in Scripture sought.
9967,PART II.,"From hence the Church is arm'd, when errors rise,"
9968,PART II.,"To stop their entrance, and prevent surprise;"
9969,PART II.,"And, safe entrench'd within, her foes without defies."
9970,PART II.,"By these all festering sores her Councils heal,"
9971,PART II.,"Which time or has disclosed, or shall reveal;"
9972,PART II.,For discord cannot end without a last appeal.
9973,PART II.,"Nor can a Council national decide,                                 370"
9974,PART II.,But with subordination to her guide;
9975,PART II.,(I wish the cause were on that issue tried.)
9976,PART II.,Much less the Scripture; for suppose debate
9977,PART II.,"Betwixt pretenders to a fair estate,"
9978,PART II.,Bequeath'd by some legator's last intent;
9979,PART II.,(Such is our dying Saviour's Testament:)
9980,PART II.,"The will is proved, is open'd, and is read;"
9981,PART II.,The doubtful heirs their differing titles plead:
9982,PART II.,"All vouch the words their interest to maintain,"
9983,PART II.,And each pretends by those his cause is plain.                     380
9984,PART II.,Shall then the Testament award the right?
9985,PART II.,"No, that's the Hungary for which they fight;"
9986,PART II.,"The field of battle, subject of debate;"
9987,PART II.,"The thing contended for, the fair estate."
9988,PART II.,"The sense is intricate, 'tis only clear"
9989,PART II.,What vowels and what consonants are there.
9990,PART II.,"Therefore 'tis plain, its meaning must be tried"
9991,PART II.,Before some judge appointed to decide.
9992,PART II.,
9993,PART II.,"Suppose, the fair apostate said, I grant,"
9994,PART II.,"The faithful flock some living guide should want,                  390"
9995,PART II.,Your arguments an endless chase pursue;
9996,PART II.,"Produce this vaunted leader to our view,"
9997,PART II.,This mighty Moses of the chosen crew.
9998,PART II.,
9999,PART II.,"The dame, who saw her fainting foe retired,"
10000,PART II.,"With force renew'd, to victory aspired;"
10001,PART II.,"And, looking upward to her kindred sky,"
10002,PART II.,"As once our Saviour own'd his Deity,"
10003,PART II.,"Pronounced his words:--""She whom ye seek am I,"""
10004,PART II.,"Nor less amazed this voice the Panther heard,"
10005,PART II.,Than were those Jews to hear a God declared.                       400
10006,PART II.,Then thus the matron modestly renew'd:
10007,PART II.,"Let all your prophets and their sects be view'd,"
10008,PART II.,And see to which of them yourselves think fit
10009,PART II.,The conduct of your conscience to submit:
10010,PART II.,"Each proselyte would vote his doctor best,"
10011,PART II.,With absolute exclusion to the rest:
10012,PART II.,"Thus would your Polish diet disagree,"
10013,PART II.,"And end, as it began, in anarchy:"
10014,PART II.,"Yourself the fairest for election stand,"
10015,PART II.,Because you seem crown-general of the land:                        410
10016,PART II.,But soon against your superstitious lawn
10017,PART II.,Some Presbyterian sabre would be drawn:
10018,PART II.,In your establish'd laws of sovereignty
10019,PART II.,"The rest some fundamental flaw would see,"
10020,PART II.,And call rebellion gospel-liberty.
10021,PART II.,To Church-decrees your articles require
10022,PART II.,"Submission modified, if not entire."
10023,PART II.,"Homage denied, to censures you proceed:"
10024,PART II.,But when Curtana[113] will not do the deed.
10025,PART II.,"You lay that pointless clergy-weapon by,                           420"
10026,PART II.,"And to the laws, your sword of justice, fly."
10027,PART II.,Now this your sects the more unkindly take
10028,PART II.,"(Those prying varlets hit the blots you make),"
10029,PART II.,"Because some ancient friends of yours declare,"
10030,PART II.,"Your only rule of faith the Scriptures are,"
10031,PART II.,"Interpreted by men of judgment sound,"
10032,PART II.,Which every sect will for themselves expound;
10033,PART II.,Nor think less reverence to their doctors due
10034,PART II.,"For sound interpretation, than to you."
10035,PART II.,"If then, by able heads, are understood                             430"
10036,PART II.,"Your brother prophets, who reform'd abroad;"
10037,PART II.,"Those able heads expound a wiser way,"
10038,PART II.,That their own sheep their shepherd should obey.
10039,PART II.,"But if you mean yourselves are only sound,"
10040,PART II.,"That doctrine turns the Reformation round,"
10041,PART II.,And all the rest are false reformers found;
10042,PART II.,"Because in sundry points you stand alone,"
10043,PART II.,Not in communion join'd with any one;
10044,PART II.,"And therefore must be all the Church, or none."
10045,PART II.,"Then, till you have agreed whose judge is best,                    440"
10046,PART II.,Against this forced submission they protest:
10047,PART II.,"While sound and sound a different sense explains,"
10048,PART II.,Both play at hardhead till they break their brains;
10049,PART II.,"And from their chairs each other's force defy,"
10050,PART II.,While unregarded thunders vainly fly.
10051,PART II.,"I pass the rest, because your Church alone"
10052,PART II.,Of all usurpers best could fill the throne.
10053,PART II.,"But neither you, nor any sect beside,"
10054,PART II.,"For this high office can be qualified,"
10055,PART II.,With necessary gifts required in such a guide.                     450
10056,PART II.,For that which must direct the whole must be
10057,PART II.,Bound in one bond of faith and unity:
10058,PART II.,But all your several Churches disagree.
10059,PART II.,The consubstantiating Church and priest
10060,PART II.,Refuse communion to the Calvinist:
10061,PART II.,"The French reform'd from preaching you restrain,"
10062,PART II.,Because you judge their ordination vain;
10063,PART II.,"And so they judge of yours, but donors must ordain."
10064,PART II.,"In short, in doctrine, or in discipline,"
10065,PART II.,Not one reform'd can with another join:                            460
10066,PART II.,"But all from each, as from damnation, fly;"
10067,PART II.,"No union they pretend, but in Non-Popery."
10068,PART II.,"Nor, should their members in a Synod meet,"
10069,PART II.,"Could any Church presume to mount the seat,"
10070,PART II.,"Above the rest, their discords to decide;"
10071,PART II.,"None would obey, but each would be the guide:"
10072,PART II.,And face to face dissensions would increase;
10073,PART II.,For only distance now preserves the peace.
10074,PART II.,"All in their turns accusers, and accused:"
10075,PART II.,Babel was never half so much confused:                             470
10076,PART II.,"What one can plead, the rest can plead as well;"
10077,PART II.,"For amongst equals lies no last appeal,"
10078,PART II.,And all confess themselves are fallible.
10079,PART II.,"Now since you grant some necessary guide,"
10080,PART II.,All who can err are justly laid aside:
10081,PART II.,Because a trust so sacred to confer                                476
10082,PART II.,Shows want of such a sure interpreter;
10083,PART II.,And how can he be needful who can err?
10084,PART II.,"Then, granting that unerring guide we want,"
10085,PART II.,That such there is you stand obliged to grant:                     480
10086,PART II.,Our Saviour else were wanting to supply
10087,PART II.,"Our needs, and obviate that necessity."
10088,PART II.,"It then remains, the Church can only be"
10089,PART II.,"The guide, which owns unfailing certainty;"
10090,PART II.,"Or else you slip your hold, and change your side,"
10091,PART II.,Relapsing from a necessary guide.
10092,PART II.,"But this annex'd condition of the crown,"
10093,PART II.,"Immunity from errors, you disown;"
10094,PART II.,"Here then you shrink, and lay your weak pretensions down."
10095,PART II.,For petty royalties you raise debate;                              490
10096,PART II.,But this unfailing universal state
10097,PART II.,You shun; nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight;
10098,PART II.,And for that cause those promises detest
10099,PART II.,With which our Saviour did his Church invest;
10100,PART II.,"But strive to evade, and fear to find them true,"
10101,PART II.,As conscious they were never meant to you:
10102,PART II.,"All which the Mother Church asserts her own,"
10103,PART II.,And with unrivall'd claim ascends the throne.
10104,PART II.,"So, when of old the Almighty Father sate"
10105,PART II.,"In council, to redeem our ruin'd state,                            500"
10106,PART II.,"Millions of millions, at a distance round,"
10107,PART II.,"Silent the sacred consistory crown'd,"
10108,PART II.,"To hear what mercy, mix'd with justice, could propound:"
10109,PART II.,"All prompt, with eager pity, to fulfil"
10110,PART II.,The full extent of their Creator's will.
10111,PART II.,"But when the stern conditions were declared,"
10112,PART II.,"A mournful whisper through the host was heard,"
10113,PART II.,"And the whole hierarchy, with heads hung down,"
10114,PART II.,Submissively declined the ponderous proffer'd crown.
10115,PART II.,"Then, not till then, the Eternal Son from high                     510"
10116,PART II.,Rose in the strength of all the Deity:
10117,PART II.,"Stood forth to accept the terms, and underwent"
10118,PART II.,A weight which all the frame of heaven had bent.
10119,PART II.,"Nor he himself could bear, but as Omnipotent."
10120,PART II.,"Now, to remove the least remaining doubt,"
10121,PART II.,"That even the blear-eyed sects may find her out,"
10122,PART II.,"Behold what heavenly rays adorn her brows,"
10123,PART II.,What from his wardrobe her beloved allows
10124,PART II.,To deck the wedding-day of his unspotted spouse.
10125,PART II.,Behold what marks of majesty she brings;                           520
10126,PART II.,Richer than ancient heirs of eastern kings!
10127,PART II.,"Her right hand holds the sceptre and the keys,"
10128,PART II.,"To show whom she commands, and who obeys:"
10129,PART II.,"With these to bind, or set the sinner free,"
10130,PART II.,With that to assert spiritual royalty.
10131,PART II.,
10132,PART II.,"One in herself, not rent by schism,[114] but sound,"
10133,PART II.,"Entire, one solid shining diamond;"
10134,PART II.,Not sparkles shatter'd into sects like you:
10135,PART II.,"One is the Church, and must be to be true:"
10136,PART II.,One central principle of unity.                                    530
10137,PART II.,"As undivided, so from errors free,"
10138,PART II.,"As one in faith, so one in sanctity."
10139,PART II.,"Thus she, and none but she, the insulting rage"
10140,PART II.,Of heretics opposed from age to age:
10141,PART II.,"Still when the giant-brood invades her throne,"
10142,PART II.,"She stoops from heaven, and meets them half way down,"
10143,PART II.,And with paternal thunder vindicates her crown.
10144,PART II.,"But like Egyptian sorcerers you stand,"
10145,PART II.,"And vainly lift aloft your magic wand,"
10146,PART II.,To sweep away the swarms of vermin from the land:                  540
10147,PART II.,"You could like them, with like infernal force,"
10148,PART II.,"Produce the plague, but not arrest the course."
10149,PART II.,"But when the boils and blotches, with disgrace                     543"
10150,PART II.,"And public scandal, sat upon the face,"
10151,PART II.,"Themselves attack'd, the Magi strove no more,"
10152,PART II.,"They saw God's finger, and their fate deplore;"
10153,PART II.,Themselves they could not cure of the dishonest sore.
10154,PART II.,"Thus one, thus pure, behold her largely spread,"
10155,PART II.,Like the fair ocean from her mother-bed;
10156,PART II.,"From east to west triumphantly she rides,                          550"
10157,PART II.,All shores are water'd by her wealthy tides.
10158,PART II.,"The Gospel-sound, diffused from pole to pole,"
10159,PART II.,"Where winds can carry, and where waves can roll,"
10160,PART II.,The self-same doctrine of the sacred page
10161,PART II.,"Convey'd to every clime, in every age."
10162,PART II.,
10163,PART II.,"Here let my sorrow give my satire place,"
10164,PART II.,To raise new blushes on my British race;
10165,PART II.,"Our sailing-ships like common sewers we use,"
10166,PART II.,And through our distant colonies diffuse
10167,PART II.,"The draught of dungeons, and the stench of stews,                  560"
10168,PART II.,"Whom, when their home-bred honesty is lost,"
10169,PART II.,We disembogue on some far Indian coast:
10170,PART II.,"Thieves, panders, paillards,[115] sins of every sort;"
10171,PART II.,Those are the manufactures we export;
10172,PART II.,And these the missioners our zeal has made:
10173,PART II.,"For, with my country's pardon be it said,"
10174,PART II.,Religion is the least of all our trade.
10175,PART II.,
10176,PART II.,Yet some improve their traffic more than we;
10177,PART II.,"For they on gain, their only god, rely,"
10178,PART II.,And set a public price on piety.                                   570
10179,PART II.,"Industrious of the needle and the chart,"
10180,PART II.,They run full sail to their Japonian mart;
10181,PART II.,"Prevention fear, and, prodigal of fame,"
10182,PART II.,"Sell all of Christian,[116] to the very name;"
10183,PART II.,"Nor leave enough of that, to hide their naked shame."
10184,PART II.,
10185,PART II.,"Thus, of three marks, which in the Creed we view,"
10186,PART II.,Not one of all can be applied to you:                              577
10187,PART II.,"Much less the fourth; in vain, alas! you seek"
10188,PART II.,The ambitious title of Apostolic:
10189,PART II.,God-like descent! 'tis well your blood can be
10190,PART II.,Proved noble in the third or fourth degree:
10191,PART II.,"For all of ancient that you had before,"
10192,PART II.,(I mean what is not borrow'd from our store)
10193,PART II.,Was error fulminated o'er and o'er;
10194,PART II.,"Old heresies condemn'd in ages past,"
10195,PART II.,By care and time recover'd from the blast.
10196,PART II.,
10197,PART II.,"'Tis said with ease, but never can be proved,"
10198,PART II.,"The Church her old foundations has removed,"
10199,PART II.,And built new doctrines on unstable sands:
10200,PART II.,"Judge that, ye winds and rains: you proved her, yet she stands.    590"
10201,PART II.,"Those ancient doctrines charged on her for new,"
10202,PART II.,"Show when and how, and from what hands they grew."
10203,PART II.,"We claim no power, when heresies grow bold,"
10204,PART II.,"To coin new faith, but still declare the old."
10205,PART II.,"How else could that obscene disease be purged,"
10206,PART II.,When controverted texts are vainly urged?
10207,PART II.,"To prove tradition new, there's somewhat more"
10208,PART II.,"Required, than saying, 'twas not used before."
10209,PART II.,"Those monumental arms are never stirr'd,"
10210,PART II.,Till schism or heresy call down Goliah's sword.                    600
10211,PART II.,
10212,PART II.,"Thus, what you call corruptions, are, in truth,"
10213,PART II.,The first plantations of the Gospel's youth;
10214,PART II.,"Old standard faith: but cast your eyes again,"
10215,PART II.,"And view those errors which new sects maintain,"
10216,PART II.,Or which of old disturb'd the Church's peaceful reign;
10217,PART II.,"And we can point each period of the time,"
10218,PART II.,"When they began, and who begot the crime;"
10219,PART II.,"Can calculate how long the eclipse endured,"
10220,PART II.,"Who interposed, what digits were obscured:"
10221,PART II.,"Of all which are already pass'd away,                              610"
10222,PART II.,"We know the rise, the progress, and decay."
10223,PART II.,
10224,PART II.,"Despair at our foundations then to strike,"
10225,PART II.,Till you can prove your faith Apostolic;
10226,PART II.,A limpid stream drawn from the native source;
10227,PART II.,Succession lawful in a lineal course.
10228,PART II.,"Prove any Church, opposed to this our head,"
10229,PART II.,"So one, so pure, so unconfinedly spread,"
10230,PART II.,"Under one chief of the spiritual state,"

10232,PART II.,"Show such a seamless coat, from schism so free,                    620"
10233,PART II.,In no communion join'd with heresy.
10234,PART II.,"If such a one you find, let truth prevail:"
10235,PART II.,Till when your weights will in the balance fail:
10236,PART II.,A Church unprincipled kicks up the scale.
10237,PART II.,But if you cannot think (nor sure you can
10238,PART II.,Suppose in God what were unjust in man)
10239,PART II.,"That He, the fountain of eternal grace,"
10240,PART II.,"Should suffer falsehood, for so long a space,"
10241,PART II.,"To banish truth, and to usurp her place:"
10242,PART II.,"That seven successive ages should be lost,                         630"
10243,PART II.,And preach damnation at their proper cost;
10244,PART II.,"That all your erring ancestors should die,"
10245,PART II.,Drown'd in the abyss of deep idolatry:
10246,PART II.,"If piety forbid such thoughts to rise,"
10247,PART II.,"Awake, and open your unwilling eyes:"
10248,PART II.,"God hath left nothing for each age undone,"
10249,PART II.,From this to that wherein he sent his Son:
10250,PART II.,"Then think but well of him, and half your work is done."
10251,PART II.,"See how his Church, adorn'd with every grace,                      639"
10252,PART II.,"With open arms, a kind forgiving face,"
10253,PART II.,Stands ready to prevent her long-lost son's embrace.
10254,PART II.,"Not more did Joseph o'er his brethren weep,"
10255,PART II.,"Nor less himself could from discovery keep,"
10256,PART II.,"When in the crowd of suppliants they were seen,"
10257,PART II.,And in their crew his best-loved Benjamin.
10258,PART II.,"That pious Joseph in the Church behold,"
10259,PART II.,"To feed your famine,[117] and refuse your gold:"
10260,PART II.,"The Joseph you exiled, the Joseph whom you sold."
10261,PART II.,
10262,PART II.,"Thus, while with heavenly charity she spoke,"
10263,PART II.,A streaming blaze the silent shadows broke;                        650
10264,PART II.,Shot from the skies; a cheerful azure light:
10265,PART II.,"The birds obscene to forests wing'd their flight,"
10266,PART II.,And gaping graves received the wandering guilty sprite.
10267,PART II.,
10268,PART II.,"Such were the pleasing triumphs of the sky,"
10269,PART II.,For James his late nocturnal victory;
10270,PART II.,"The pledge of his Almighty Patron's love,"
10271,PART II.,The fireworks which his angels made above.
10272,PART II.,I saw myself the lambent easy light
10273,PART II.,"Gild the brown horror, and dispel the night:"
10274,PART II.,The messenger with speed the tidings bore;                         660
10275,PART II.,"News, which three labouring nations did restore;"
10276,PART II.,But Heaven's own Nuntius was arrived before.
10277,PART II.,
10278,PART II.,"By this, the Hind had reach'd her lonely cell,"
10279,PART II.,"And vapours rose, and dews unwholesome fell."
10280,PART II.,"When she, by frequent observation wise,"
10281,PART II.,"As one who long on heaven had fix'd her eyes,"
10282,PART II.,Discern'd a change of weather in the skies;
10283,PART II.,"The western borders were with crimson spread,"
10284,PART II.,The moon descending look'd all flaming red;
10285,PART II.,She thought good manners bound her to invite                       670
10286,PART II.,The stranger dame to be her guest that night.
10287,PART II.,"'Tis true, coarse diet, and a short repast,"
10288,PART II.,(She said) were weak inducements to the taste
10289,PART II.,"Of one so nicely bred, and so unused to fast:"
10290,PART II.,"But what plain fare her cottage could afford,"
10291,PART II.,"A hearty welcome at a homely board,"
10292,PART II.,"Was freely hers; and, to supply the rest,"
10293,PART II.,"An honest meaning, and an open breast:"
10294,PART II.,"Last, with content of mind, the poor man's wealth,"
10295,PART II.,A grace-cup to their common patron's health.                       680
10296,PART II.,"This she desired her to accept, and stay"
10297,PART II.,"For fear she might be wilder'd in her way,"
10298,PART II.,Because she wanted an unerring guide;
10299,PART II.,And then the dew-drops on her silken hide
10300,PART II.,"Her tender constitution did declare,"
10301,PART II.,"Too lady-like a long fatigue to bear,"
10302,PART II.,And rough inclemencies of raw nocturnal air.
10303,PART II.,"But most she fear'd that, travelling so late,"
10304,PART II.,"Some evil-minded beasts might lie in wait,"
10305,PART II.,"And, without witness, wreak their hidden hate.                     690"
10306,PART II.,
10307,PART II.,"The Panther, though she lent a listening ear,"
10308,PART II.,Had more of lion in her than to fear:
10309,PART II.,"Yet, wisely weighing, since she had to deal"
10310,PART II.,"With many foes, their numbers might prevail,"
10311,PART II.,"Return'd her all the thanks she could afford,"
10312,PART II.,And took her friendly hostess at her word:
10313,PART II.,"Who, entering first her lowly roof, a shed"
10314,PART II.,"With hoary moss, and winding ivy spread,"
10315,PART II.,"Honest enough to hide an humble hermit's head,"
10316,PART II.,Thus graciously bespoke her welcome guest:                         700
10317,PART II.,"So might these walls, with your fair presence blest,"
10318,PART II.,Become your dwelling-place of everlasting rest;
10319,PART II.,"Not for a night, or quick revolving year;"
10320,PART II.,"Welcome an owner, not a sojourner."
10321,PART II.,This peaceful seat my poverty secures;
10322,PART II.,War seldom enters but where wealth allures:
10323,PART II.,Nor yet despise it; for this poor abode
10324,PART II.,"Has oft received, and yet receives a God;"
10325,PART II.,A God victorious of the Stygian race
10326,PART II.,"Here laid his sacred limbs, and sanctified the place,              710"
10327,PART II.,This mean retreat did mighty Pan contain:
10328,PART II.,"Be emulous of him, and pomp disdain,"
10329,PART II.,And dare not to debase your soul to gain.
10330,PART II.,
10331,PART II.,The silent stranger stood amazed to see
10332,PART II.,"Contempt of wealth, and wilful poverty:"
10333,PART II.,"And, though ill habits are not soon controll'd,"
10334,PART II.,A while suspended her desire of gold.
10335,PART II.,"But civilly drew in her sharpen'd paws,"
10336,PART II.,Not violating hospitable laws;
10337,PART II.,"And pacified her tail, and lick'd her frothy jaws.                 720"
10338,PART II.,
10339,PART II.,The Hind did first her country cates provide;
10340,PART II.,Then couch'd herself securely by her side.

10400,PART III.,Because the Lion's peace[119] was now proclaim'd:

10402,PART III.,To forfeit the protection of her prince;

10466,PART III.,
10467,PART III.,Complaints of lovers help to ease their pain;

10499,PART III.,My crying sins are not of luxury.
10500,PART III.,"Some juster motive sure your mind withdraws,"

10504,PART III.,Show more occasion for your discontent;
10505,PART III.,"Your love, the Wolf, would help you to invent:                     120"
10506,PART III.,"Some German quarrel, or, as times go now,"

10508,PART III.,"When at the fountain's head, as merit ought"
10509,PART III.,"To claim the place, you take a swilling draught,"
10510,PART III.,"How easy 'tis an envious eye to throw,"
10511,PART III.,And tax the sheep for troubling streams below;
10512,PART III.,Or call her (when no farther cause you find)
10513,PART III.,An enemy possess'd of all your kind!
10514,PART III.,"But then, perhaps, the wicked world would think,"
10515,PART III.,The Wolf design'd to eat as well as drink.                         130
10516,PART III.,
10517,PART III.,"This last allusion gall'd the Panther more,"
10518,PART III.,Because indeed it rubb'd upon the sore.
10519,PART III.,"Yet seem'd she not to wince, though shrewdly pain'd:"
10520,PART III.,But thus her passive character maintain'd.
10521,PART III.,
10522,PART III.,"I never grudged, whate'er my foes report,"
10523,PART III.,Your flaunting fortune in the Lion's court.
10524,PART III.,"You have your day, or you are much belied,"
10525,PART III.,But I am always on the suffering side:
10526,PART III.,"You know my doctrine, and I need not say,"
10527,PART III.,"I will not, but I cannot disobey.                                  140"
10528,PART III.,On this firm principle I ever stood;
10529,PART III.,"He of my sons who fails to make it good,"
10530,PART III.,By one rebellious act renounces to my blood.
10531,PART III.,
10532,PART III.,"Ah, said the Hind, how many sons have you,"
10533,PART III.,"Who call you mother, whom you never knew!"
10534,PART III.,"But most of them who that relation plead,"
10535,PART III.,Are such ungracious youths as wish you dead.
10536,PART III.,"They gape at rich revenues which you hold,"
10537,PART III.,And fain would nibble at your grandame Gold;
10538,PART III.,"Inquire into your years, and laugh to find                         150"
10539,PART III.,Your crazy temper shows you much declined.
10540,PART III.,"Were you not dim and doted, you might see"
10541,PART III.,"A pack of cheats that claim a pedigree,"
10542,PART III.,"No more of kin to you, than you to me."
10543,PART III.,"Do you not know, that for a little coin,"
10544,PART III.,Heralds can foist a name into the line?
10545,PART III.,They ask you blessing but for what you have;
10546,PART III.,"But once possess'd of what with care you save,"
10547,PART III.,The wanton boys would piss upon your grave.
10548,PART III.,
10549,PART III.,"Your sons of latitude that court your grace,                     160"
10550,PART III.,Though most resembling you in form and face.
10551,PART III.,Are far the worst of your pretended race.
10552,PART III.,"And, but I blush your honesty to blot,"
10553,PART III.,Pray God you prove them lawfully begot:
10554,PART III.,"For in some Popish libels I have read,"
10555,PART III.,The Wolf has been too busy in your bed;
10556,PART III.,"At least her hinder parts, the belly-piece,"
10557,PART III.,"The paunch, and all that Scorpio claims, are his."
10558,PART III.,Their malice too a sore suspicion brings;
10559,PART III.,"For though they dare not bark, they snarl at kings:                170"
10560,PART III.,Nor blame them for intruding in your line;
10561,PART III.,Fat bishoprics are still of right divine.
10562,PART III.,
10563,PART III.,Think you your new French proselytes[121] are come
10564,PART III.,"To starve abroad, because they starved at home?"
10565,PART III.,Your benefices twinkled from afar;
10566,PART III.,They found the new Messiah by the star:
10567,PART III.,"Those Swisses fight on any side for pay,"
10568,PART III.,"And 'tis the living that conforms, not they."
10569,PART III.,"Mark with what management their tribes divide,"
10570,PART III.,"Some stick to you, and some to the other side,                     180"
10571,PART III.,That many churches may for many mouths provide.
10572,PART III.,More vacant pulpits would more converts make;
10573,PART III.,All would have latitude enough to take:
10574,PART III.,The rest unbeneficed your sects maintain;
10575,PART III.,"For ordinations without cures are vain,"
10576,PART III.,And chamber practice is a silent gain.
10577,PART III.,Your sons of breadth at home are much like these;
10578,PART III.,Their soft and yielding metals run with ease:
10579,PART III.,"They melt, and take the figure of the mould;"
10580,PART III.,But harden and preserve it best in gold.                           190
10581,PART III.,
10582,PART III.,"Your Delphic sword, the Panther then replied,"
10583,PART III.,"Is double-edged, and cuts on either side."
10584,PART III.,"Some sons of mine, who bear upon their shield"
10585,PART III.,"Three steeples argent in a sable field,"
10586,PART III.,"Have sharply tax'd your converts, who unfed"
10587,PART III.,Have follow'd you for miracles of bread;
10588,PART III.,"Such who themselves of no religion are,"
10589,PART III.,"Allured with gain, for any will declare."
10590,PART III.,Bare lies with bold assertions they can face;
10591,PART III.,But dint of argument is out of place.                              200
10592,PART III.,The grim logician puts them in a fright;
10593,PART III.,'Tis easier far to flourish than to fight.
10594,PART III.,Thus our eighth Henry's marriage they defame;
10595,PART III.,"They say the schism of beds began the game,"
10596,PART III.,Divorcing from the Church to wed the dame:
10597,PART III.,"Though largely proved, and by himself profess'd,"
10598,PART III.,"That conscience, conscience would not let him rest:"
10599,PART III.,
10600,PART III.,"I mean, not till possess'd of her he loved,"
10601,PART III.,"And old, uncharming Catherine was removed."
10602,PART III.,"For sundry years before he did complain,                           210"
10603,PART III.,And told his ghostly confessor his pain.
10604,PART III.,"With the same impudence without a ground,"
10605,PART III.,"They say, that look the Reformation round,"
10606,PART III.,No Treatise of Humility is found.
10607,PART III.,"But if none were, the gospel does not want;"
10608,PART III.,"Our Saviour preach'd it, and I hope you grant,"
10609,PART III.,The Sermon on the Mount was Protestant.
10610,PART III.,
10611,PART III.,"No doubt, replied the Hind, as sure as all"
10612,PART III.,The writings of Saint Peter and Saint Paul:
10613,PART III.,On that decision let it stand or fall.                             220
10614,PART III.,"Now for my converts, who, you say, unfed,"
10615,PART III.,Have follow'd me for miracles of bread;
10616,PART III.,"Judge not by hearsay, but observe at least,"
10617,PART III.,If since their change their loaves have been increased.
10618,PART III.,"The Lion buys no converts; if he did,"
10619,PART III.,Beasts would be sold as fast as he could bid.
10620,PART III.,"Tax those of interest who conform for gain,"
10621,PART III.,Or stay the market of another reign:
10622,PART III.,Your broad-way sons would never be too nice
10623,PART III.,"To close with Calvin, if he paid their price;                      230"
10624,PART III.,"But, raised three steeples higher, would change their note,"
10625,PART III.,And quit the cassock for the canting-coat.
10626,PART III.,"Now, if you damn this censure, as too bold,"
10627,PART III.,"Judge by yourselves, and think not others sold."
10628,PART III.,
10629,PART III.,"Meantime my sons, accused by fame's report,"
10630,PART III.,"Pay small attendance at the Lion's court,"
10631,PART III.,"Nor rise with early crowds, nor flatter late;"
10632,PART III.,For silently they beg who daily wait.
10633,PART III.,"Preferment is bestow'd, that comes unsought;"
10634,PART III.,"Attendance is a bribe, and then 'tis bought.                       240"
10635,PART III.,"How they should speed, their fortune is untried;"
10636,PART III.,"For not to ask, is not to be denied."
10637,PART III.,"For what they have, their God and king they bless,"
10638,PART III.,"And hope they should not murmur, had they less."
10639,PART III.,"But if reduced, subsistence to implore,"
10640,PART III.,In common prudence they should pass your door.
10641,PART III.,"Unpitied Hudibras,[122] your champion friend,"
10642,PART III.,Has shown how far your charities extend.
10643,PART III.,"This lasting verse shall on his tomb be read,"
10644,PART III.,"""He shamed you living, and upbraids you dead.""                     250"
10645,PART III.,
10646,PART III.,With odious atheist names[123] you load your foes;
10647,PART III.,Your liberal clergy why did I expose?
10648,PART III.,It never fails in charities like those.
10649,PART III.,"In climes where true religion is profess'd,"
10650,PART III.,That imputation were no laughing jest.
10651,PART III.,"But imprimatur,[124] with a chaplain's name,"
10652,PART III.,Is here sufficient licence to defame.
10653,PART III.,What wonder is't that black detraction thrives?
10654,PART III.,The homicide of names is less than lives;
10655,PART III.,And yet the perjured murderer survives.                            260
10656,PART III.,
10657,PART III.,"This said, she paused a little, and suppress'd"
10658,PART III.,The boiling indignation of her breast.
10659,PART III.,"She knew the virtue of her blade, nor would"
10660,PART III.,Pollute her satire with ignoble blood:
10661,PART III.,"Her panting foe she saw before her eye,"
10662,PART III.,And back she drew the shining weapon dry.
10663,PART III.,So when the generous Lion has in sight
10664,PART III.,"His equal match, he rouses for the fight;"
10665,PART III.,"But when his foe lies prostrate on the plain,"
10666,PART III.,"He sheaths his paws, uncurls his angry mane,                       270"
10667,PART III.,"And, pleased with bloodless honours of the day,"
10668,PART III.,Walks over and disdains the inglorious prey.
10669,PART III.,"So James, if great with less we may compare,"
10670,PART III.,Arrests his rolling thunderbolts in air!
10671,PART III.,"And grants ungrateful friends a lengthen'd space,"
10672,PART III.,To implore the remnants of long-suffering grace.
10673,PART III.,
10674,PART III.,This breathing-time the matron took; and then
10675,PART III.,Resumed the thread of her discourse again.
10676,PART III.,"Be vengeance wholly left to powers divine,"
10677,PART III.,And let Heaven judge betwixt your sons and mine:                   280
10678,PART III.,If joys hereafter must be purchased here
10679,PART III.,"With loss of all that mortals hold so dear,"
10680,PART III.,"Then welcome infamy and public shame,"
10681,PART III.,"And, last, a long farewell to worldly fame."
10682,PART III.,"'Tis said with ease, but, oh, how hardly tried"
10683,PART III.,By haughty souls to human honour tied!
10684,PART III.,O sharp convulsive pangs of agonizing pride!
10685,PART III.,"Down then, thou rebel, never more to rise,"
10686,PART III.,"And what thou didst, and dost, so dearly prize,"
10687,PART III.,"That fame, that darling fame, make that thy sacrifice.             290"
10688,PART III.,"'Tis nothing thou hast given, then add thy tears"
10689,PART III.,For a long race of unrepenting years:
10690,PART III.,"'Tis nothing yet, yet all thou hast to give:"
10691,PART III.,Then add those may-be years thou hast to live:
10692,PART III.,"Yet nothing still; then poor, and naked come:"
10693,PART III.,"Thy father will receive his unthrift home,"
10694,PART III.,And thy blest Saviour's blood discharge the mighty sum.
10695,PART III.,
10696,PART III.,"Thus (she pursued) I discipline a son,"
10697,PART III.,Whose uncheck'd fury to revenge would run:
10698,PART III.,"He champs the bit, impatient of his loss,                          300"
10699,PART III.,"And starts aside, and flounders at the Cross."
10700,PART III.,"Instruct him better, gracious God, to know,"
10701,PART III.,"As thine is vengeance, so forgiveness too:"
10702,PART III.,"That, suffering from ill tongues, he bears no more"
10703,PART III.,"Than what his sovereign bears, and what his Saviour bore."
10704,PART III.,
10705,PART III.,"It now remains for you to school your child,"
10706,PART III.,And ask why God's anointed he reviled;
10707,PART III.,A king and princess dead! did Shimei worse?
10708,PART III.,The cursor's punishment should fright the curse:
10709,PART III.,"Your son was warn'd, and wisely gave it o'er,                      310"
10710,PART III.,But he who counsell'd him has paid the score:
10711,PART III.,"The heavy malice could no higher tend,"
10712,PART III.,But woe to him on whom the weights descend.
10713,PART III.,So to permitted ills the Demon flies;
10714,PART III.,His rage is aim'd at him who rules the skies:
10715,PART III.,"Constrain'd to quit his cause, no succour found,"
10716,PART III.,"The foe discharges every tire around,"
10717,PART III.,In clouds of smoke abandoning the fight;
10718,PART III.,But his own thundering peals proclaim his flight.
10719,PART III.,
10720,PART III.,In Henry's change his charge as ill succeeds;                     320
10721,PART III.,To that long story little answer needs:
10722,PART III.,Confront but Henry's words with Henry's deeds.
10723,PART III.,"Were space allow'd, with ease it might be proved,"
10724,PART III.,What springs his blessed Reformation moved.
10725,PART III.,"The dire effects appear'd in open sight,"
10726,PART III.,"Which from the cause he calls a distant flight,"
10727,PART III.,And yet no larger leap than from the sun to light.
10728,PART III.,
10729,PART III.,"Now let your sons a double pæan sound,"
10730,PART III.,A Treatise of Humility is found.
10731,PART III.,"'Tis found, but better it had ne'er been sought,                   330"
10732,PART III.,Than thus in Protestant procession brought.
10733,PART III.,"The famed original through Spain is known,"
10734,PART III.,"Rodriguez' work, my celebrated son,"
10735,PART III.,"Which yours, by ill-translating, made his own;"
10736,PART III.,"Conceal'd its author, and usurp'd the name,"
10737,PART III.,The basest and ignoblest theft of fame.
10738,PART III.,My altars kindled first that living coal;
10739,PART III.,"Restore, or practice better, what you stole:"
10740,PART III.,"That virtue could this humble verse inspire,"
10741,PART III.,'Tis all the restitution I require.                                340
10742,PART III.,
10743,PART III.,"Glad was the Panther that the charge was closed,"
10744,PART III.,And none of all her favourite sons exposed.
10745,PART III.,"For laws of arms permit each injured man,"
10746,PART III.,To make himself a saver where he can.
10747,PART III.,Perhaps the plunder'd merchant cannot tell
10748,PART III.,The names of pirates in whose hands he fell;
10749,PART III.,"But at the den of thieves he justly flies,"
10750,PART III.,And every Algerine is lawful prize.
10751,PART III.,No private person in the foe's estate
10752,PART III.,Can plead exemption from the public fate.                          350
10753,PART III.,Yet Christian laws allow not such redress;
10754,PART III.,Then let the greater supersede the less.
10755,PART III.,But let the abettors of the Panther's crime
10756,PART III.,Learn to make fairer wars another time.
10757,PART III.,Some characters may sure be found to write
10758,PART III.,"Among her sons; for 'tis no common sight,"
10759,PART III.,"A spotted dam, and all her offspring white."
10760,PART III.,
10761,PART III.,"The savage, though she saw her plea controll'd,"
10762,PART III.,"Yet would not wholly seem to quit her hold,"
10763,PART III.,"But offer'd fairly to compound the strife,                         360"
10764,PART III.,And judge conversion by the convert's life.
10765,PART III.,"'Tis true, she said, I think it somewhat strange,"
10766,PART III.,So few should follow profitable change:
10767,PART III.,"For present joys are more to flesh and blood,"
10768,PART III.,Than a dull prospect of a distant good.
10769,PART III.,'Twas well alluded by a son of mine
10770,PART III.,"(I hope to quote him is not to purloin),"
10771,PART III.,"Two magnets, heaven and earth, allure to bliss;"
10772,PART III.,"The larger loadstone that, the nearer this:"
10773,PART III.,The weak attraction of the greater fails;                          370
10774,PART III.,"We nod a while, but neighbourhood prevails:"
10775,PART III.,"But when the greater proves the nearer too,"
10776,PART III.,I wonder more your converts come so slow.
10777,PART III.,"Methinks in those who firm with me remain,"
10778,PART III.,It shows a nobler principle than gain.
10779,PART III.,
10780,PART III.,"Your inference would be strong, the Hind replied,"
10781,PART III.,If yours were in effect the suffering side:
10782,PART III.,"Your clergy's sons their own in peace possess,"
10783,PART III.,Nor are their prospects in reversion less.
10784,PART III.,My proselytes are struck with awful dread;                         380
10785,PART III.,Your bloody comet-laws hang blazing o'er their head;
10786,PART III.,"The respite they enjoy but only lent,"
10787,PART III.,"The best they have to hope, protracted punishment."
10788,PART III.,"Be judge yourself, if interest may prevail,"
10789,PART III.,"Which motives, yours or mine, will turn the scale."
10790,PART III.,"While pride and pomp allure, and plenteous ease,"
10791,PART III.,"That is, till man's predominant passions cease,"
10792,PART III.,Admire no longer at my slow increase.
10793,PART III.,
10794,PART III.,By education most have been misled;
10795,PART III.,"So they believe, because they so were bred.                        390"
10796,PART III.,"The priest continues what the nurse began,"
10797,PART III.,And thus the child imposes on the man.
10798,PART III.,"The rest I named before, nor need repeat:"
10799,PART III.,"But interest is the most prevailing cheat,"
10800,PART III.,The sly seducer both of age and youth;
10801,PART III.,"They study that, and think they study truth."
10802,PART III.,"When interest fortifies an argument,"
10803,PART III.,Weak reason serves to gain the will's assent;
10804,PART III.,"For souls, already warp'd, receive an easy bent."
10805,PART III.,"Add long prescription of establish'd laws,                         400"
10806,PART III.,"And pique of honour to maintain a cause,"
10807,PART III.,"And shame of change, and fear of future ill,"
10808,PART III.,"And zeal, the blind conductor of the will;"
10809,PART III.,"And chief among the still-mistaking crowd,"
10810,PART III.,"The fame of teachers obstinate and proud,"
10811,PART III.,"And, more than all, the private judge allow'd;"
10812,PART III.,"Disdain of Fathers which the dance began,"
10813,PART III.,"And last, uncertain whose the narrower span,"
10814,PART III.,"The clown unread, and half-read gentleman."
10815,PART III.,
10816,PART III.,"To this the Panther, with a scornful smile:                      410"
10817,PART III.,"Yet still you travel with unwearied toil,"
10818,PART III.,"And range around the realm without control,"
10819,PART III.,"Among my sons for proselytes to prowl,"
10820,PART III.,And here and there you snap some silly soul.
10821,PART III.,You hinted fears of future change in state;
10822,PART III.,Pray heaven you did not prophesy your fate!
10823,PART III.,"Perhaps you think your time of triumph near,"
10824,PART III.,But may mistake the season of the year;
10825,PART III.,The Swallow's[125] fortune gives you cause to fear.
10826,PART III.,
10827,PART III.,"For charity, replied the matron, tell                            420"
10828,PART III.,What sad mischance those pretty birds befell.
10829,PART III.,
10830,PART III.,"Nay, no mischance, the savage dame replied,"
10831,PART III.,"But want of wit in their unerring guide,"
10832,PART III.,"And eager haste, and gaudy hopes, and giddy pride."
10833,PART III.,"Yet, wishing timely warning may prevail,"
10834,PART III.,"Make you the moral, and I'll tell the tale."
10835,PART III.,
10836,PART III.,"The Swallow, privileged above the rest"
10837,PART III.,"Of all the birds, as man's familiar guest,"
10838,PART III.,"Pursues the sun in summer, brisk and bold,"
10839,PART III.,But wisely shuns the persecuting cold:                             430
10840,PART III.,"Is well to chancels and to chimneys known,"
10841,PART III.,Though 'tis not thought she feeds on smoke alone.
10842,PART III.,"From hence she has been held of heavenly line,"
10843,PART III.,Endued with particles of soul divine.
10844,PART III.,This merry chorister had long possess'd
10845,PART III.,"Her summer seat, and feather'd well her nest:"
10846,PART III.,"Till frowning skies began to change their cheer,"
10847,PART III.,And time turn'd up the wrong side of the year;
10848,PART III.,The shedding trees began the ground to strow
10849,PART III.,"With yellow leaves, and bitter blasts to blow.                     440"
10850,PART III.,"Sad auguries of winter thence she drew,"
10851,PART III.,"Which by instinct, or prophecy, she knew:"
10852,PART III.,"When prudence warn'd her to remove betimes,"
10853,PART III.,"And seek a better heaven, and warmer climes."
10854,PART III.,
10855,PART III.,"Her sons were summon'd on a steeple's height,"
10856,PART III.,"And, call'd in common council, vote a flight;"
10857,PART III.,"The day was named, the next that should be fair:"
10858,PART III.,"All to the general rendezvous repair,"
10859,PART III.,"They try their fluttering wings, and trust themselves in air."
10860,PART III.,"But whether upward to the moon they go,                            450"
10861,PART III.,"Or dream the winter out in caves below,"
10862,PART III.,"Or hawk at flies elsewhere, concerns us not to know."
10863,PART III.,
10864,PART III.,"Southwards, you may be sure, they bent their flight,"
10865,PART III.,And harbour'd in a hollow rock at night:
10866,PART III.,"Next morn they rose, and set up every sail;"
10867,PART III.,"The wind was fair, but blew a mackerel gale:"
10868,PART III.,"The sickly young sat shivering on the shore,"
10869,PART III.,"Abhorr'd salt water never seen before,"
10870,PART III.,And pray'd their tender mothers to delay
10871,PART III.,"The passage, and expect a fairer day.                              460"
10872,PART III.,
10873,PART III.,"With these the Martin readily concurr'd,"
10874,PART III.,"A church-begot, and church-believing bird;"
10875,PART III.,"Of little body, but of lofty mind,"
10876,PART III.,"Round-bellied, for a dignity design'd,"
10877,PART III.,"And much a dunce, as Martins are by kind."
10878,PART III.,"Yet often quoted Canon-laws, and Code,"
10879,PART III.,And Fathers which he never understood;
10880,PART III.,But little learning needs in noble blood.
10881,PART III.,"For, sooth to say, the Swallow brought him in,"
10882,PART III.,"Her household chaplain, and her next of kin:                       470"
10883,PART III.,"In superstition silly to excess,"
10884,PART III.,And casting schemes by planetary guess:
10885,PART III.,"In fine, short-wing'd, unfit himself to fly,"
10886,PART III.,His fears foretold foul weather in the sky.
10887,PART III.,
10888,PART III.,"Besides, a Raven from a wither'd oak,"
10889,PART III.,"Left of their lodging, was observed to croak."
10890,PART III.,That omen liked him not; so his advice
10891,PART III.,"Was present safety, bought at any price;"
10892,PART III.,"A seeming pious care, that cover'd cowardice."
10893,PART III.,"To strengthen this, he told a boding dream                         480"
10894,PART III.,"Of rising waters, and a troubled stream,"
10895,PART III.,"Sure signs of anguish, dangers, and distress,"
10896,PART III.,"With something more, not lawful to express:"
10897,PART III.,By which he slily seem'd to intimate
10898,PART III.,Some secret revelation of their fate.
10899,PART III.,"For he concluded, once upon a time,"
10900,PART III.,"He found a leaf inscribed with sacred rhyme,"
10901,PART III.,Whose antique characters did well denote
10902,PART III.,The Sibyl's hand of the Cumæan grot:
10903,PART III.,"The mad divineress had plainly writ,                               490"
10904,PART III.,"A time should come (but many ages yet),"
10905,PART III.,"In which, sinister destinies ordain,"
10906,PART III.,"A dame should drown with all her feather'd train,"
10907,PART III.,And seas from thence be call'd the Chelidonian main.
10908,PART III.,"At this, some shook for fear, the more devout"
10909,PART III.,"Arose, and bless'd themselves from head to foot."
10910,PART III.,
10911,PART III.,"'Tis true, some stagers of the wiser sort"
10912,PART III.,Made all these idle wonderments their sport:
10913,PART III.,"They said, their only danger was delay,"
10914,PART III.,"And he, who heard what every fool could say,                       500"
10915,PART III.,"Would never fix his thought, but trim his time away."
10916,PART III.,"The passage yet was good; the wind, 'tis true,"
10917,PART III.,"Was somewhat high, but that was nothing new,"
10918,PART III.,No more than usual equinoxes blew.
10919,PART III.,"The sun, already from the Scales declined,"
10920,PART III.,"Gave little hopes of better days behind,"
10921,PART III.,"But change, from bad to worse, of weather and of wind."
10922,PART III.,Nor need they fear the dampness of the sky
10923,PART III.,"Should flag their wings, and hinder them to fly"
10924,PART III.,'Twas only water thrown on sails too dry.                          510
10925,PART III.,"But, least of all, philosophy presumes"
10926,PART III.,"Of truth in dreams, from melancholy fumes:"
10927,PART III.,"Perhaps the Martin, housed in holy ground,"
10928,PART III.,"Might think of ghosts that walk their midnight round,"
10929,PART III.,"Till grosser atoms, tumbling in the stream"
10930,PART III.,"Of fancy, madly met, and clubb'd into a dream:"
10931,PART III.,"As little weight his vain presages bear,"
10932,PART III.,Of ill effect to such alone who fear:
10933,PART III.,"Most prophecies are of a piece with these,"
10934,PART III.,Each Nostradamus can foretell with ease:                           520
10935,PART III.,"Not naming persons, and confounding times,"
10936,PART III.,One casual truth supports a thousand lying rhymes.
10937,PART III.,
10938,PART III.,"The advice was true; but fear had seized the most,"
10939,PART III.,And all good counsel is on cowards lost.
10940,PART III.,"The question crudely put to shun delay,"
10941,PART III.,'Twas carried by the major part to stay.
10942,PART III.,
10943,PART III.,"His point thus gain'd, Sir Martin dated thence"
10944,PART III.,"His power, and from a priest became a prince."
10945,PART III.,"He order'd all things with a busy care,"
10946,PART III.,"And cells and refectories did prepare,                             530"
10947,PART III.,And large provisions laid of winter fare:
10948,PART III.,But now and then let fall a word or two
10949,PART III.,"Of hope, that Heaven some miracle might show,"
10950,PART III.,And for their sakes the sun should backward go;
10951,PART III.,"Against the laws of nature upward climb, 535"
10952,PART III.,"And, mounted on the Ram, renew the prime:"
10953,PART III.,"For which two proofs in sacred story lay,"
10954,PART III.,"Of Ahaz' dial, and of Joshua's day."
10955,PART III.,"In expectation of such times as these,"
10956,PART III.,"A chapel housed them, truly call'd of ease:                        540"
10957,PART III.,For Martin much devotion did not ask:
10958,PART III.,"They pray'd sometimes, and that was all their task."
10959,PART III.,
10960,PART III.,"It happen'd, as beyond the reach of wit"
10961,PART III.,"Blind prophecies may have a lucky hit,"
10962,PART III.,"That this accomplish'd, or at least in part,"
10963,PART III.,Gave great repute to their new Merlin's art.
10964,PART III.,"Some Swifts, the giants of the Swallow kind,"
10965,PART III.,"Large-limb'd, stout-hearted, but of stupid mind"
10966,PART III.,"(For Swisses, or for Gibeonites design'd),"
10967,PART III.,"These lubbers, peeping through a broken pane,                      550"
10968,PART III.,"To suck fresh air, survey'd the neighbouring plain;"
10969,PART III.,And saw (but scarcely could believe their eyes)
10970,PART III.,"New blossoms flourish, and new flowers arise;"
10971,PART III.,"As God had been abroad, and, walking there,"
10972,PART III.,"Had left his footsteps, and reform'd the year:"
10973,PART III.,The sunny hills from far were seen to glow
10974,PART III.,"With glittering beams, and in the meads below"
10975,PART III.,The burnish'd brooks appear'd with liquid gold to flow.
10976,PART III.,"At last they heard the foolish Cuckoo sing,"
10977,PART III.,Whose note proclaim'd the holiday of spring.                       560
10978,PART III.,
10979,PART III.,"No longer doubting, all prepare to fly,"
10980,PART III.,And repossess their patrimonial sky.
10981,PART III.,The priest before them did his wings display;
10982,PART III.,"And that good omens might attend their way,"
10983,PART III.,"As luck would have it, 'twas St Martin's day."
10984,PART III.,
10985,PART III.,Who but the Swallow triumphs now alone?
10986,PART III.,The canopy of heaven is all her own:
10987,PART III.,"Her youthful offspring to their haunts repair,"
10988,PART III.,"And glide along in glades, and skim in air,"
10989,PART III.,"And dip for insects in the purling springs,                        570"
10990,PART III.,And stoop on rivers to refresh their wings.
10991,PART III.,"Their mothers think a fair provision made,"
10992,PART III.,That every son can live upon his trade:
10993,PART III.,"And, now the careful charge is off their hands,"
10994,PART III.,"Look out for husbands, and new nuptial bands:"
10995,PART III.,The youthful widow longs to be supplied;
10996,PART III.,But first the lover is by lawyers tied
10997,PART III.,To settle jointure-chimneys on the bride.
10998,PART III.,"So thick they couple, in so short a space,"
10999,PART III.,That Martin's marriage-offerings rise apace.
11000,PART III.,"Their ancient houses running to decay,"
11001,PART III.,"Are furbish'd up, and cemented with clay;                          580"
11002,PART III.,"They teem already; store of eggs are laid,"
11003,PART III.,And brooding mothers call Lucina's aid.
11004,PART III.,"Fame spreads the news, and foreign fowls appear"
11005,PART III.,"In flocks to greet the new returning year,"
11006,PART III.,"To bless the founder, and partake the cheer."
11007,PART III.,
11008,PART III.,And now 'twas time (so fast their numbers rise)
11009,PART III.,"To plant abroad, and people colonies."
11010,PART III.,"The youth drawn forth, as Martin had desired                       590"
11011,PART III.,"(For so their cruel destiny required),"
11012,PART III.,Were sent far off on an ill-fated day;
11013,PART III.,"The rest would needs conduct them on their way,"
11014,PART III.,"And Martin went, because he fear'd alone to stay."
11015,PART III.,
11016,PART III.,"So long they flew with inconsiderate haste,"
11017,PART III.,That now their afternoon began to waste;
11018,PART III.,"And, what was ominous, that very morn"
11019,PART III.,The sun was enter'd into Capricorn;
11020,PART III.,"Which, by their bad astronomer's account,"
11021,PART III.,That week the Virgin balance should remount.                       600
11022,PART III.,"An infant moon eclipsed him in his way,"
11023,PART III.,And hid the small remainders of his day.
11024,PART III.,"The crowd, amazed, pursued no certain mark;"
11025,PART III.,"But birds met birds, and jostled in the dark:"
11026,PART III.,Few mind the public in a panic fright;
11027,PART III.,And fear increased the horror of the night.
11028,PART III.,"Night came, but unattended with repose;"
11029,PART III.,"Alone she came, no sleep their eyes to close:"
11030,PART III.,"Alone, and black she came; no friendly stars arose."
11031,PART III.,
11032,PART III.,"What should they do, beset with dangers round,                   610"
11033,PART III.,"No neighbouring dorp,[126] no lodging to be found,"
11034,PART III.,"But bleaky plains, and bare unhospitable ground."
11035,PART III.,"The latter brood, who just began to fly,"
11036,PART III.,"Sick-feather'd, and unpractised in the sky,"
11037,PART III.,For succour to their helpless mother call:
11038,PART III.,She spread her wings; some few beneath them crawl;
11039,PART III.,"She spread them wider yet, but could not cover all."
11040,PART III.,"To augment their woes, the winds began to move,"
11041,PART III.,"Debate in air, for empty fields above,"
11042,PART III.,"Till Boreas got the skies, and pour'd amain                        620"
11043,PART III.,His rattling hailstones mix'd with snow and rain.
11044,PART III.,
11045,PART III.,"The joyless morning late arose, and found"
11046,PART III.,A dreadful desolation reign around--
11047,PART III.,"Some buried in the snow, some frozen to the ground."
11048,PART III.,"The rest were struggling still with death, and lay"
11049,PART III.,"The Crows' and Ravens' rights, an undefended prey:"
11050,PART III.,Excepting Martin's race; for they and he
11051,PART III.,Had gain'd the shelter of a hollow tree:
11052,PART III.,"But soon discover'd by a sturdy clown,"
11053,PART III.,"He headed all the rabble of a town,                                630"
11054,PART III.,"And finish'd them with bats, or poll'd them down."
11055,PART III.,"Martin himself was caught alive, and tried"
11056,PART III.,"For treasonous crimes, because the laws provide"
11057,PART III.,No Martin there in winter shall abide.
11058,PART III.,"High on an oak, which never leaf shall bear,"
11059,PART III.,"He breathed his last, exposed to open air;"
11060,PART III.,"And there his corpse, unbless'd, is hanging still,"
11061,PART III.,To show the change of winds with his prophetic bill.
11062,PART III.,
11063,PART III.,The patience of the Hind did almost fail;
11064,PART III.,For well she mark'd the malice of the tale;[127]                   640
11065,PART III.,Which ribald art their Church to Luther owes;
11066,PART III.,"In malice it began, by malice grows;"
11067,PART III.,"He sow'd the Serpent's teeth, an iron-harvest rose."
11068,PART III.,"But most in Martin's character and fate,"
11069,PART III.,"She saw her slander'd sons, the Panther's hate,"
11070,PART III.,"The people's rage, the persecuting state:"
11071,PART III.,"Then said, I take the advice in friendly part;"
11072,PART III.,"You clear your conscience, or at least your heart:"
11073,PART III.,"Perhaps you fail'd in your foreseeing skill,"
11074,PART III.,For Swallows are unlucky birds to kill:                            650
11075,PART III.,"As for my sons, the family is bless'd,"
11076,PART III.,Whose every child is equal to the rest;
11077,PART III.,No Church reform'd can boast a blameless line;
11078,PART III.,"Such Martins build in yours, and more than mine:"
11079,PART III.,"Or else an old fanatic[128] author lies,"
11080,PART III.,Who summ'd their scandals up by centuries.
11081,PART III.,But through your parable I plainly see
11082,PART III.,"The bloody laws, the crowd's barbarity;"
11083,PART III.,The sunshine that offends the purblind sight:
11084,PART III.,"Had some their wishes, it would soon be night.                     660"
11085,PART III.,Mistake me not; the charge concerns not you:
11086,PART III.,"Your sons are malcontents, but yet are true,"
11087,PART III.,As far as non-resistance makes them so;
11088,PART III.,"But that's a word of neutral sense, you know,"
11089,PART III.,"A passive term, which no relief will bring,"
11090,PART III.,But trims betwixt a rebel and a king.
11091,PART III.,
11092,PART III.,"Rest well assured, the Pardelis replied,"
11093,PART III.,"My sons would all support the regal side,"
11094,PART III.,Though Heaven forbid the cause by battle should be tried.
11095,PART III.,
11096,PART III.,"The matron answer'd with a loud Amen,                            670"
11097,PART III.,And thus pursued her argument again.
11098,PART III.,"If, as you say, and as I hope no less,"
11099,PART III.,"Your sons will practise what yourselves profess,"
11100,PART III.,What angry power prevents our present peace?
11101,PART III.,"The Lion, studious of our common good,"
11102,PART III.,Desires (and kings' desires are ill withstood)
11103,PART III.,To join our nations in a lasting love;
11104,PART III.,The bars betwixt are easy to remove;
11105,PART III.,For sanguinary laws were never made above.
11106,PART III.,"If you condemn that prince of tyranny,                             680"
11107,PART III.,"Whose mandate forced your Gallic friends to fly,"
11108,PART III.,Make not a worse example of your own;
11109,PART III.,"Or cease to rail at causeless rigour shown,"
11110,PART III.,And let the guiltless person throw the stone.
11111,PART III.,His blunted sword your suffering brotherhood
11112,PART III.,Have seldom felt; he stops it short of blood:
11113,PART III.,"But you have ground the persecuting knife,"
11114,PART III.,And set it to a razor edge on life.
11115,PART III.,"Cursed be the wit, which cruelty refines,"
11116,PART III.,Or to his father's rod the scorpion's joins!                       690
11117,PART III.,Your finger is more gross than the great monarch's loins.
11118,PART III.,"But you, perhaps, remove that bloody note,"
11119,PART III.,And stick it on the first reformer's coat.
11120,PART III.,"Oh, let their crime in long oblivion sleep!"
11121,PART III.,"'Twas theirs indeed to make, 'tis yours to keep."
11122,PART III.,"Unjust, or just, is all the question now;"
11123,PART III.,"'Tis plain, that not repealing you allow."
11124,PART III.,
11125,PART III.,To name the Test would put you in a rage;
11126,PART III.,"You charge not that on any former age,"
11127,PART III.,
11128,PART III.,"But smile to think how innocent you stand,                         700"
11129,PART III.,"Arm'd by a weapon put into your hand,"
11130,PART III.,Yet still remember that you wield a sword
11131,PART III.,Forged by your foes against your sovereign lord;
11132,PART III.,"Design'd to hew the imperial cedar down,"
11133,PART III.,"Defraud succession, and dis-heir the crown."
11134,PART III.,"To abhor the makers, and their laws approve,"
11135,PART III.,"Is to hate traitors, and the treason love."
11136,PART III.,"What means it else, which now your children say,"
11137,PART III.,"We made it not, nor will we take away?"
11138,PART III.,
11139,PART III.,Suppose some great oppressor had by slight                        710
11140,PART III.,"Of law, disseised your brother of his right,"
11141,PART III.,Your common sire surrendering in a fright;
11142,PART III.,"Would you to that unrighteous title stand,"
11143,PART III.,Left by the villain's will to heir the land?
11144,PART III.,"More just was Judas, who his Saviour sold;"
11145,PART III.,"The sacrilegious bribe he could not hold,"
11146,PART III.,"Nor hang in peace, before he render'd back the gold."
11147,PART III.,"What more could you have done, than now you do,"
11148,PART III.,"Had Oates and Bedlow, and their plot been true?"
11149,PART III.,Some specious reasons for those wrongs were found;                 720
11150,PART III.,"Their dire magicians threw their mists around,"
11151,PART III.,And wise men walk'd as on enchanted ground.
11152,PART III.,But now when time has made the imposture plain
11153,PART III.,"(Late though he follow'd truth, and limping held her train),"
11154,PART III.,What new delusion charms your cheated eyes again?
11155,PART III.,"The painted harlot might a while bewitch,"
11156,PART III.,"But why the hag uncased, and all obscene with itch?"
11157,PART III.,
11158,PART III.,The first Reformers were a modest race;
11159,PART III.,Our peers possess'd in peace their native place;
11160,PART III.,"And when rebellious arms o'erturn'd the state,                     730"
11161,PART III.,They suffer'd only in the common fate:
11162,PART III.,"But now the Sovereign mounts the regal chair,"
11163,PART III.,"And mitred seats are full, yet David's bench is bare."
11164,PART III.,"Your answer is, they were not dispossess'd;"
11165,PART III.,They need but rub their metal on the test
11166,PART III.,To prove their ore: 'twere well if gold alone
11167,PART III.,Were touch'd and tried on your discerning stone;
11168,PART III.,But that unfaithful Test unsound will pass
11169,PART III.,"The dross of atheists, and sectarian brass:"
11170,PART III.,As if the experiment were made to hold                             740
11171,PART III.,"For base production, and reject the gold."
11172,PART III.,"Thus men ungodded may to places rise,"
11173,PART III.,And sects may be preferr'd without disguise:
11174,PART III.,No danger to the Church or State from these;
11175,PART III.,The Papist only has his writ of ease.
11176,PART III.,No gainful office gives him the pretence
11177,PART III.,"To grind the subject, or defraud the prince."
11178,PART III.,"Wrong conscience, or no conscience, may deserve"
11179,PART III.,"To thrive, but ours alone is privileged to starve."
11180,PART III.,"Still thank yourselves, you cry; your noble race                   750"
11181,PART III.,"We banish not, but they forsake the place;"
11182,PART III.,"Our doors are open: true, but ere they come,"
11183,PART III.,"You toss your 'censing Test, and fume the room;"
11184,PART III.,"As if 'twere Toby's[129] rival to expel,"
11185,PART III.,And fright the fiend who could not bear the smell.
11186,PART III.,
11187,PART III.,To this the Panther sharply had replied;
11188,PART III.,"But having gain'd a verdict on her side,"
11189,PART III.,She wisely gave the loser leave to chide;
11190,PART III.,"Well satisfied to have the But and Peace,"
11191,PART III.,"And for the plaintiff's cause she cared the less,                  760"
11192,PART III.,Because she sued in _forma pauperis_;
11193,PART III.,Yet thought it decent something should be said;
11194,PART III.,For secret guilt by silence is betray'd.
11195,PART III.,"So neither granted all, nor much denied,"
11196,PART III.,But answer'd with a yawning kind of pride:
11197,PART III.,
11198,PART III.,"Methinks such terms of proffer'd peace you bring,"
11199,PART III.,As once Æneas to the Italian king:
11200,PART III.,By long possession all the land is mine;
11201,PART III.,"You strangers come with your intruding line,"
11202,PART III.,"To share my sceptre, which you call to join.                       770"
11203,PART III.,"You plead, like him, an ancient pedigree,"
11204,PART III.,And claim a peaceful seat by fate's decree.
11205,PART III.,"In ready pomp your sacrificer stands,"
11206,PART III.,"To unite the Trojan and the Latin bands,"
11207,PART III.,"And, that the league more firmly may be tied,"
11208,PART III.,Demand the fair Lavinia for your bride.
11209,PART III.,"Thus plausibly you veil the intended wrong,"
11210,PART III.,But still you bring your exiled gods along;
11211,PART III.,"And will endeavour, in succeeding space,"
11212,PART III.,Those household puppets on our hearths to place.                   780
11213,PART III.,Perhaps some barbarous laws have been preferr'd;
11214,PART III.,"I spake against the Test, but was not heard;"
11215,PART III.,"These to rescind, and peerage to restore,"
11216,PART III.,My gracious Sovereign would my vote implore:
11217,PART III.,"I owe him much, but owe my conscience more."
11218,PART III.,
11219,PART III.,"Conscience is then your plea, replied the dame,"
11220,PART III.,"Which, well inform'd, will ever be the same."
11221,PART III.,"But yours is much of the chameleon hue,"
11222,PART III.,To change the dye with every distant view.
11223,PART III.,"When first the Lion sat with awful sway,                           790"
11224,PART III.,Your conscience taught your duty to obey:
11225,PART III.,He might have had your Statutes and your Test;
11226,PART III.,No conscience but of subjects was profess'd.
11227,PART III.,"He found your temper, and no farther tried,"
11228,PART III.,"But on that broken reed, your Church, relied."
11229,PART III.,"In vain the sects assay'd their utmost art,"
11230,PART III.,With offer'd treasure to espouse their part;
11231,PART III.,Their treasures were a bribe too mean to move his heart.
11232,PART III.,"But when, by long experience, you had proved,"
11233,PART III.,"How far he could forgive, how well he loved;                       800"
11234,PART III.,"A goodness that excell'd his godlike race,"
11235,PART III.,And only short of Heaven's unbounded grace;
11236,PART III.,"A flood of mercy that o'erflow'd our isle,"
11237,PART III.,"Calm in the rise, and fruitful as the Nile;"
11238,PART III.,"Forgetting whence our Egypt was supplied,"
11239,PART III.,You thought your sovereign bound to send the tide:
11240,PART III.,"Nor upward look'd on that immortal spring,"
11241,PART III.,"But vainly deem'd, he durst not be a king:"
11242,PART III.,"Then Conscience, unrestrain'd by fear, began"
11243,PART III.,"To stretch her limits, and extend the span;                        810"
11244,PART III.,"Did his indulgence as her gift dispose,"
11245,PART III.,And made a wise alliance with her foes.
11246,PART III.,"Can Conscience own the associating name,"
11247,PART III.,And raise no blushes to conceal her shame?
11248,PART III.,For sure she has been thought a bashful dame.
11249,PART III.,"But if the cause by battle should be tried,"
11250,PART III.,You grant she must espouse the regal side:
11251,PART III.,"O Proteous Conscience, never to be tied!"
11252,PART III.,"What Phoebus from the Tripod shall disclose,"
11253,PART III.,"Which are, in last resort, your friends or foes?                   820"
11254,PART III.,"Homer, who learn'd the language of the sky,"
11255,PART III.,The seeming Gordian knot would soon untie;
11256,PART III.,"Immortal powers the term of Conscience know,"
11257,PART III.,But Interest is her name with men below.
11258,PART III.,
11259,PART III.,"Conscience or Interest be 't, or both in one,"
11260,PART III.,"The Panther answer'd in a surly tone,"
11261,PART III.,"The first commands me to maintain the crown,"
11262,PART III.,The last forbids to throw my barriers down.
11263,PART III.,"Our penal laws no sons of yours admit,"
11264,PART III.,Our Test excludes your tribe from benefit.                         830
11265,PART III.,"These are my banks your ocean to withstand,"
11266,PART III.,"Which, proudly rising, overlooks the land;"
11267,PART III.,"And, once let in, with unresisted sway,"
11268,PART III.,Would sweep the pastors and their flocks away.
11269,PART III.,Think not my judgment leads me to comply
11270,PART III.,"With laws unjust, but hard necessity;"
11271,PART III.,"Imperious need, which cannot be withstood,"
11272,PART III.,"Makes ill authentic, for a greater good."
11273,PART III.,"Possess your soul with patience, and attend:"
11274,PART III.,A more auspicious planet may ascend;                               840
11275,PART III.,"Good fortune may present some happier time,"
11276,PART III.,With means to cancel my unwilling crime;
11277,PART III.,"(Unwilling, witness all ye Powers above!)"
11278,PART III.,"To mend my errors, and redeem your love:"
11279,PART III.,That little space you safely may allow;
11280,PART III.,Your all-dispensing power protects you now.
11281,PART III.,
11282,PART III.,"Hold, said the Hind, 'tis needless to explain;"
11283,PART III.,You would postpone me to another reign;
11284,PART III.,Till when you are content to be unjust:
11285,PART III.,"Your part is to possess, and mine to trust.                        850"
11286,PART III.,"A fair exchange proposed of future chance,"
11287,PART III.,For present profit and inheritance.
11288,PART III.,Few words will serve to finish our dispute;
11289,PART III.,"Who will not now repeal, would persecute."
11290,PART III.,"To ripen green revenge your hopes attend,"
11291,PART III.,Wishing that happier planet would ascend.
11292,PART III.,For shame let Conscience be your plea no more:
11293,PART III.,"To will hereafter, proves she might before;"
11294,PART III.,"But she's a bawd to gain, and holds the door."
11295,PART III.,
11296,PART III.,Your care about your banks infers a fear                         860
11297,PART III.,Of threatening floods and inundations near;
11298,PART III.,"If so, a just reprise would only be"
11299,PART III.,Of what the land usurp'd upon the sea;
11300,PART III.,And all your jealousies but serve to show
11301,PART III.,"Your ground is, like your neighbour-nation, low."
11302,PART III.,"To intrench in what you grant unrighteous laws,"
11303,PART III.,Is to distrust the justice of your cause;
11304,PART III.,And argues that the true religion lies
11305,PART III.,In those weak adversaries you despise.
11306,PART III.,
11307,PART III.,Tyrannic force is that which least you fear;                      700
11308,PART III.,The sound is frightful in a Christian's ear:
11309,PART III.,"Avert it, Heaven! nor let that plague be sent"
11310,PART III.,To us from the dispeopled continent.
11311,PART III.,
11312,PART III.,But piety commands me to refrain;
11313,PART III.,Those prayers are needless in this monarch's reign.
11314,PART III.,"Behold! how he protects your friends oppress'd,"
11315,PART III.,"Receives the banish'd, succours the distress'd:"
11316,PART III.,"Behold, for you may read an honest open breast."
11317,PART III.,"He stands in day-light, and disdains to hide"
11318,PART III.,"An act, to which by honour he is tied,                             880"
11319,PART III.,"A generous, laudable, and kingly pride."
11320,PART III.,"Your Test he would repeal, his peers restore;"
11321,PART III.,"This when he says he means, he means no more."
11322,PART III.,
11323,PART III.,"Well, said the Panther, I believe him just,"
11324,PART III.,And yet----
11325,PART III.,"And yet, 'tis but because you must;"
11326,PART III.,"You would be trusted, but you would not trust."
11327,PART III.,The Hind thus briefly; and disdain'd to enlarge
11328,PART III.,"On power of kings, and their superior charge,"
11329,PART III.,As Heaven's trustees before the people's choice:                   890
11330,PART III.,Though sure the Panther did not much rejoice
11331,PART III.,To hear those echoes given of her once loyal voice.
11332,PART III.,
11333,PART III.,"The matron woo'd her kindness to the last,"
11334,PART III.,But could not win; her hour of grace was past.
11335,PART III.,"Whom, thus persisting, when she could not bring"
11336,PART III.,"To leave the Wolf, and to believe her king,"
11337,PART III.,"She gave her up, and fairly wish'd her joy"
11338,PART III.,Of her late treaty with her new ally:
11339,PART III.,"Which well she hoped would more successful prove,"
11340,PART III.,Than was the Pigeon's and the Buzzard's love.                      900
11341,PART III.,The Panther ask'd what concord there could be
11342,PART III.,Betwixt two kinds whose natures disagree?
11343,PART III.,"The dame replied: 'Tis sung in every street,"
11344,PART III.,The common chat of gossips when they meet;
11345,PART III.,"But, since unheard by you, 'tis worth your while"
11346,PART III.,"To take a wholesome tale, though told in homely style."
11347,PART III.,
11348,PART III.,"A plain good man,[130] whose name is understood"
11349,PART III.,"(So few deserve the name of plain and good),"
11350,PART III.,"Of three fair lineal lordships stood possess'd,"
11351,PART III.,"And lived, as reason was, upon the best.                           910"
11352,PART III.,"Inured to hardships from his early youth,"
11353,PART III.,"Much had he done, and suffer'd for his truth:"
11354,PART III.,"At land and sea, in many a doubtful fight,"
11355,PART III.,"Was never known a more adventurous knight,"
11356,PART III.,"Who oftener drew his sword, and always for the right."
11357,PART III.,
11358,PART III.,"As fortune would (his fortune came, though late)"
11359,PART III.,He took possession of his just estate:
11360,PART III.,Nor rack'd his tenants with increase of rent;
11361,PART III.,"Nor lived too sparing, nor too largely spent;"
11362,PART III.,"But overlook'd his hinds; their pay was just,                      920"
11363,PART III.,"And ready, for he scorn'd to go on trust:"
11364,PART III.,"Slow to resolve, but in performance quick;"
11365,PART III.,"So true, that he was awkward at a trick."
11366,PART III.,"For little souls on little shifts rely,"
11367,PART III.,And coward arts of mean expedients try;
11368,PART III.,The noble mind will dare do anything but lie.
11369,PART III.,"False friends, his deadliest foes, could find no way"
11370,PART III.,"But shows of honest bluntness, to betray:"
11371,PART III.,That unsuspected plainness he believed;
11372,PART III.,"He looked into himself, and was deceived.                          930"
11373,PART III.,"Some lucky planet sure attends his birth,"
11374,PART III.,Or Heaven would make a miracle on earth;
11375,PART III.,For prosperous honesty is seldom seen
11376,PART III.,"To bear so dead a weight, and yet to win."
11377,PART III.,"It looks as fate with nature's law would strive,"
11378,PART III.,To show plain-dealing once an age may thrive:
11379,PART III.,"And, when so tough a frame she could not bend,"
11380,PART III.,Exceeded her commission to befriend.
11381,PART III.,
11382,PART III.,"This grateful man, as Heaven increased his store."
11383,PART III.,"Gave God again, and daily fed his poor.                            940"
11384,PART III.,His house with all convenience was purvey'd;
11385,PART III.,"The rest he found, but raised the fabric where he pray'd;"
11386,PART III.,And in that sacred place his beauteous wife
11387,PART III.,Employ'd her happiest hours of holy life.
11388,PART III.,
11389,PART III.,"Nor did their alms extend to those alone,"
11390,PART III.,Whom common faith more strictly made their own;
11391,PART III.,"A sort of Doves[131] were housed too near their hall,"
11392,PART III.,"Who cross the proverb, and abound with gall."
11393,PART III.,"Though some, 'tis true, are passively inclined,"
11394,PART III.,The greater part degenerate from their kind;                       950
11395,PART III.,"Voracious birds, that hotly bill and breed,"
11396,PART III.,"And largely drink, because on salt they feed."
11397,PART III.,Small gain from them their bounteous owner draws;
11398,PART III.,"Yet, bound by promise, he supports their cause,"
11399,PART III.,As corporations privileged by laws.
11400,PART III.,
11401,PART III.,"That house which harbour to their kind affords,"
11402,PART III.,"Was built, long since, God knows for better birds;"
11403,PART III.,"But fluttering there, they nestle near the throne,"
11404,PART III.,"And lodge in habitations not their own,"
11405,PART III.,By their high crops and corny gizzards known.                      960
11406,PART III.,"Like Harpies, they could scent a plenteous board,"
11407,PART III.,Then to be sure they never fail'd their lord:
11408,PART III.,"The rest was form, and bare attendance paid;"
11409,PART III.,"They drank, and ate, and grudgingly obey'd."
11410,PART III.,"The more they fed, they raven'd still for more;"
11411,PART III.,"They drain'd from Dan, and left Beersheba poor."
11412,PART III.,"All this they had by law, and none repined;"
11413,PART III.,The preference was but due to Levi's kind;
11414,PART III.,"But when some lay-preferment fell by chance,"
11415,PART III.,The gourmands made it their inheritance.                           970
11416,PART III.,"When once possess'd, they never quit their claim;"
11417,PART III.,For then 'tis sanctified to Heaven's high name;
11418,PART III.,"And, hallow'd thus, they cannot give consent,"
11419,PART III.,The gift should be profaned by worldly management.
11420,PART III.,
11421,PART III.,Their flesh was never to the table served;
11422,PART III.,Though 'tis not thence inferr'd the birds were starved;
11423,PART III.,"But that their master did not like the food,"
11424,PART III.,"As rank, and breeding melancholy blood."
11425,PART III.,"Nor did it with his gracious nature suit,"
11426,PART III.,"Even though they were not Doves, to persecute:                     980"
11427,PART III.,Yet he refused (nor could they take offence)
11428,PART III.,Their glutton kind should teach him abstinence.
11429,PART III.,"Nor consecrated grain their wheat he thought,"
11430,PART III.,"Which, new from treading, in their bills they brought:"
11431,PART III.,"But left his hinds each in his private power,"
11432,PART III.,That those who like the bran might leave the flour.
11433,PART III.,"He for himself, and not for others, chose,"
11434,PART III.,"Nor would he be imposed on, nor impose;"
11435,PART III.,"But in their faces his devotion paid,"
11436,PART III.,"And sacrifice with solemn rites was made,                          990"
11437,PART III.,And sacred incense on his altars laid.
11438,PART III.,"Besides these jolly birds, whose corpse impure"
11439,PART III.,Repaid their commons with their salt-manure;
11440,PART III.,"Another farm[132] he had behind his house,"
11441,PART III.,"Not overstock'd, but barely for his use:"
11442,PART III.,"Wherein his poor domestic poultry fed,"
11443,PART III.,And from his pious hands received their bread.
11444,PART III.,"Our pamper'd Pigeons, with malignant eyes,"
11445,PART III.,"Beheld these inmates, and their nurseries:"
11446,PART III.,"Though hard their fare, at evening, and at morn,                  1000"
11447,PART III.,A cruise of water and an ear of corn;
11448,PART III.,"Yet still they grudged that modicum, and thought"
11449,PART III.,A sheaf in every single grain was brought.
11450,PART III.,"Fain would they filch that little food away,"
11451,PART III.,While unrestrain'd those happy gluttons prey.
11452,PART III.,"And much they grieved to see so nigh their hall,"
11453,PART III.,The bird that warn'd St Peter of his fall;
11454,PART III.,"That he should raise his mitred crest on high,"
11455,PART III.,"And clap his wings, and call his family"
11456,PART III.,To sacred rites; and vex the ethereal powers                      1010
11457,PART III.,With midnight matins at uncivil hours:
11458,PART III.,"Nay more, his quiet neighbours should molest,"
11459,PART III.,Just in the sweetness of their morning rest.
11460,PART III.,"Beast of a bird, supinely when he might"
11461,PART III.,"Lie snug and sleep, to rise before the light!"
11462,PART III.,"What if his dull forefathers used that cry,"
11463,PART III.,Could he not let a bad example die?
11464,PART III.,The world was fallen into an easier way;
11465,PART III.,This age knew better than to fast and pray.
11466,PART III.,Good sense in sacred worship would appear                         1020
11467,PART III.,"So to begin, as they might end the year."
11468,PART III.,Such feats in former times had wrought the falls
11469,PART III.,Of crowing Chanticleers[133] in cloister'd walls.
11470,PART III.,"Expell'd for this, and for their lands, they fled;"
11471,PART III.,"And sister Partlet,[134] with her hooded head,"
11472,PART III.,"Was hooted hence, because she would not pray a-bed."
11473,PART III.,"The way to win the restive world to God,"
11474,PART III.,"Was to lay by the disciplining rod,"
11475,PART III.,"Unnatural fasts, and foreign forms of prayer:"
11476,PART III.,Religion frights us with a mien severe.                           1030
11477,PART III.,"'Tis prudence to reform her into ease,"
11478,PART III.,And put her in undress to make her please;
11479,PART III.,"A lively faith will bear aloft the mind,"
11480,PART III.,And leave the luggage of good works behind.
11481,PART III.,
11482,PART III.,Such doctrines in the Pigeon-house were taught:
11483,PART III.,You need not ask how wondrously they wrought:
11484,PART III.,"But sure the common cry was all for these,"
11485,PART III.,Whose life and precepts both encouraged ease.
11486,PART III.,"Yet fearing those alluring baits might fail,"
11487,PART III.,And holy deeds o'er all their arts prevail;                       1040
11488,PART III.,"(For vice, though frontless, and of harden'd face,"
11489,PART III.,Is daunted at the sight of awful grace;)
11490,PART III.,"An hideous figure of their foes they drew,"
11491,PART III.,"Nor lines, nor looks, nor shades, nor colours true;"
11492,PART III.,And this grotesque design exposed to public view.
11493,PART III.,"One would have thought it some Egyptian piece,"
11494,PART III.,"With garden-gods, and barking deities,"
11495,PART III.,More thick than Ptolemy has stuck the skies.
11496,PART III.,"All so perverse a draught, so far unlike,"
11497,PART III.,It was no libel where it meant to strike.                         1050
11498,PART III.,"Yet still the daubing pleased, and great and small,"
11499,PART III.,"To view the monster, crowded Pigeon Hall."
11500,PART III.,There Chanticleer was drawn upon his knees
11501,PART III.,"Adoring shrines, and stocks of sainted trees:"
11502,PART III.,"And by him, a misshapen, ugly race;"
11503,PART III.,The curse of God was seen on every face:
11504,PART III.,"No Holland emblem could that malice mend,"
11505,PART III.,"But still the worse the look, the fitter for a fiend."
11506,PART III.,
11507,PART III.,"The master of the farm, displeased to find"
11508,PART III.,"So much of rancour in so mild a kind,                             1060"
11509,PART III.,"Enquired into the cause, and came to know,"
11510,PART III.,The passive Church had struck the foremost blow;
11511,PART III.,"With groundless fears and jealousies possess'd,"
11512,PART III.,As if this troublesome intruding guest
11513,PART III.,Would drive the birds of Venus from their nest;
11514,PART III.,A deed his inborn equity abhorr'd;
11515,PART III.,"But Interest will not trust, though God should plight his word."
11516,PART III.,
11517,PART III.,"A law,[135] the source of many future harms,"
11518,PART III.,Had banish'd all the poultry from the farms;
11519,PART III.,"With loss of life, if any should be found                         1070"
11520,PART III.,To crow or peck on this forbidden ground.
11521,PART III.,That bloody statute chiefly was design'd
11522,PART III.,"For Chanticleer the white, of clergy kind;"
11523,PART III.,But after-malice did not long forget
11524,PART III.,The lay that wore the robe and coronet.
11525,PART III.,"For them, for their inferiors and allies,"
11526,PART III.,Their foes a deadly Shibboleth devise:
11527,PART III.,"By which unrighteously it was decreed,"
11528,PART III.,"That none to trust or profit should succeed,"
11529,PART III.,Who would not swallow first a poisonous wicked weed:[136]         1080
11530,PART III.,"Or that, to which old Socrates was cursed,"
11531,PART III.,Or henbane juice to swell them till they burst.
11532,PART III.,
11533,PART III.,The patron (as in reason) thought it hard
11534,PART III.,"To see this inquisition in his yard,"
11535,PART III.,By which the Sovereign was of subjects' use debarr'd.
11536,PART III.,"All gentle means he tried, which might withdraw"
11537,PART III.,The effects of so unnatural a law:
11538,PART III.,But still the Dove-house obstinately stood
11539,PART III.,Deaf to their own and to their neighbours' good;
11540,PART III.,"And which was worse, if any worse could be,                       1090"
11541,PART III.,Repented of their boasted loyalty:
11542,PART III.,Now made the champions of a cruel cause.
11543,PART III.,And drunk with fumes of popular applause;
11544,PART III.,"For those whom God to ruin has design'd,"
11545,PART III.,"He fits for fate, and first destroys their mind."
11546,PART III.,
11547,PART III.,"New doubts indeed they daily strove to raise,"
11548,PART III.,"Suggested dangers, interposed delays;"
11549,PART III.,"And emissary Pigeons had in store,"
11550,PART III.,"Such as the Meccan prophet used of yore,"
11551,PART III.,To whisper counsels in their patron's ear;                        1100
11552,PART III.,And veil'd their false advice with zealous fear.
11553,PART III.,"The master smiled to see them work in vain,"
11554,PART III.,"To wear him out, and make an idle reign:"
11555,PART III.,"He saw, but suffer'd their protractive arts,"
11556,PART III.,And strove by mildness to reduce their hearts:
11557,PART III.,"But they abused that grace to make allies,"
11558,PART III.,And fondly closed with former enemies;
11559,PART III.,"For fools are doubly fools, endeavouring to be wise."
11560,PART III.,
11561,PART III.,"After a grave consult what course were best,"
11562,PART III.,"One, more mature in folly than the rest,                          1110"
11563,PART III.,"Stood up, and told them, with his head aside,"
11564,PART III.,That desperate cures must be to desperate ills applied:
11565,PART III.,"And therefore, since their main impending fear"
11566,PART III.,"Was from the increasing race of Chanticleer,"
11567,PART III.,"Some potent bird of prey they ought to find,"
11568,PART III.,"A foe profess'd to him, and all his kind:"
11569,PART III.,"Some haggard Hawk, who had her eyrie nigh,"
11570,PART III.,"Well pounced to fasten, and well wing'd to fly;"
11571,PART III.,"One they might trust, their common wrongs to wreak:"
11572,PART III.,"The Musquet and the Coystrel were too weak,                       1120"
11573,PART III.,"Too fierce the Falcon; but, above the rest,"
11574,PART III.,The noble Buzzard[137] ever pleased me best;
11575,PART III.,"Of small renown, 'tis true; for, not to lie,"
11576,PART III.,We call him but a Hawk by courtesy.
11577,PART III.,"I know he hates the Pigeon-house and Farm,"
11578,PART III.,"And more, in time of war has done us harm:"
11579,PART III.,But all his hate on trivial points depends;
11580,PART III.,"Give up our forms, and we shall soon be friends."
11581,PART III.,For Pigeons' flesh he seems not much to care;
11582,PART III.,Cramm'd chickens are a more delicious fare.                       1130
11583,PART III.,"On this high potentate, without delay,"
11584,PART III.,I wish you would confer the sovereign sway:
11585,PART III.,"Petition him to accept the government,"
11586,PART III.,And let a splendid embassy be sent.
11587,PART III.,
11588,PART III.,"This pithy speech prevail'd, and all agreed,"
11589,PART III.,"Old enmities forgot, the Buzzard should succeed."
11590,PART III.,
11591,PART III.,"Their welcome suit was granted soon as heard,"
11592,PART III.,"His lodgings furnish'd, and a train prepared,"
11593,PART III.,"With B's upon their breast, appointed for his guard."
11594,PART III.,"He came, and crown'd with great solemnity;                        1140"
11595,PART III.,"God save king Buzzard, was the general cry."
11596,PART III.,
11597,PART III.,"A portly prince, and goodly to the sight,"
11598,PART III.,He seem'd a son of Anak for his height:
11599,PART III.,Like those whom stature did to crowns prefer:
11600,PART III.,"Black-brow'd, and bluff, like Homer's Jupiter:"
11601,PART III.,"Broad-back'd, and brawny-built for love's delight;"
11602,PART III.,A prophet form'd to make a female proselyte.
11603,PART III.,A theologue more by need than genial bent;
11604,PART III.,"By breeding sharp, by nature confident."
11605,PART III.,Interest in all his actions was discern'd;                        1150
11606,PART III.,"More learn'd than honest, more a wit than learn'd:"
11607,PART III.,"Or forced by fear, or by his profit led,"
11608,PART III.,"Or both conjoin'd, his native clime he fled:"
11609,PART III.,But brought the virtues of his heaven along;
11610,PART III.,"A fair behaviour, and a fluent tongue."
11611,PART III.,And yet with all his arts he could not thrive;
11612,PART III.,The most unlucky parasite alive.
11613,PART III.,"Loud praises to prepare his paths he sent,"
11614,PART III.,And then himself pursued his compliment;
11615,PART III.,"But by reverse of fortune chased away,                            1160"
11616,PART III.,His gifts no longer than their author stay:
11617,PART III.,"He shakes the dust against the ungrateful race,"
11618,PART III.,And leaves the stench of ordures in the place.
11619,PART III.,Oft has he flatter'd and blasphemed the same;
11620,PART III.,For in his rage he spares no sovereign's name:
11621,PART III.,The hero and the tyrant change their style
11622,PART III.,By the same measure that they frown or smile.
11623,PART III.,"When well received by hospitable foes,"
11624,PART III.,"The kindness he returns, is to expose:"
11625,PART III.,"For courtesies, though undeserved and great,                      1170"
11626,PART III.,No gratitude in felon-minds beget;
11627,PART III.,"As tribute to his wit, the churl receives the treat."
11628,PART III.,His praise of foes is venomously nice;
11629,PART III.,"So touch'd, it turns a virtue to a vice:"
11630,PART III.,"""A Greek, and bountiful, forewarns us twice."""
11631,PART III.,"Seven sacraments he wisely does disown,"
11632,PART III.,Because he knows Confession stands for one;
11633,PART III.,"Where sins to sacred silence are convey'd,"
11634,PART III.,"And not for fear, or love, to be betray'd:"
11635,PART III.,"But he, uncall'd, his patron to control,                          1180"
11636,PART III.,Divulged the secret whispers of his soul;
11637,PART III.,"Stood forth the accusing Satan of his crimes,"
11638,PART III.,And offer'd to the Moloch of the times.
11639,PART III.,"Prompt to assail, and careless of defence,"
11640,PART III.,"Invulnerable in his impudence,"
11641,PART III.,"He dares the world; and, eager of a name,"
11642,PART III.,"He thrusts about, and jostles into fame."
11643,PART III.,"Frontless, and satire-proof, he scours the streets,"
11644,PART III.,And runs an Indian-muck at all he meets.
11645,PART III.,"So fond of loud report, that not to miss                          1190"
11646,PART III.,Of being known (his last and utmost bliss)
11647,PART III.,He rather would be known for what he is.
11648,PART III.,
11649,PART III.,"Such was, and is, the Captain of the Test,"
11650,PART III.,Though half his virtues are not here express'd;
11651,PART III.,The modesty of fame conceals the rest.
11652,PART III.,The spleenful Pigeons never could create
11653,PART III.,A prince more proper to revenge their hate:
11654,PART III.,"Indeed, more proper to revenge, than save;"
11655,PART III.,"A king, whom in his wrath the Almighty gave:"
11656,PART III.,"For all the grace the landlord had allow'd,                       1200"
11657,PART III.,But made the Buzzard and the Pigeons proud;
11658,PART III.,"Gave time to fix their friends, and to seduce the crowd."
11659,PART III.,"They long their fellow-subjects to enthral,"
11660,PART III.,"Their patron's promise into question call,"
11661,PART III.,And vainly think he meant to make them lords of all.
11662,PART III.,
11663,PART III.,"False fears their leaders fail'd not to suggest,"
11664,PART III.,As if the Doves were to be dispossess'd;
11665,PART III.,"Nor sighs, nor groans, nor goggling eyes did want;"
11666,PART III.,For now the Pigeons too had learn'd to cant.
11667,PART III.,The house of prayer is stock'd with large increase;               1210
11668,PART III.,Nor doors nor windows can contain the press:
11669,PART III.,For birds of every feather fill the abode;
11670,PART III.,Even Atheists out of envy own a God:
11671,PART III.,"And, reeking from the stews, adulterers come,"
11672,PART III.,Like Goths and Vandals to demolish Rome.
11673,PART III.,"That Conscience, which to all their crimes was mute,"
11674,PART III.,"Now calls aloud, and cries to persecute:"
11675,PART III.,"No rigour of the laws to be released,"
11676,PART III.,"And much the less, because it was their Lord's request:"
11677,PART III.,"They thought it great their Sovereign to control,                 1220"
11678,PART III.,"And named their pride, nobility of soul."
11679,PART III.,
11680,PART III.,"'Tis true, the Pigeons, and their prince elect,"
11681,PART III.,"Were short of power, their purpose to effect:"
11682,PART III.,"But with their quills did all the hurt they could,"
11683,PART III.,And cuff'd the tender Chickens from their food:
11684,PART III.,"And much the Buzzard in their cause did stir,"
11685,PART III.,"Though naming not the patron, to infer,"
11686,PART III.,"With all respect, he was a gross idolater."
11687,PART III.,
11688,PART III.,"But when the imperial owner did espy,"
11689,PART III.,"That thus they turn'd his grace to villany,                       1230"
11690,PART III.,"Not suffering wrath to discompose his mind,"
11691,PART III.,"He strove a temper for the extremes to find,"
11692,PART III.,"So to be just, as he might still be kind;"
11693,PART III.,"Then, all maturely weigh'd, pronounced a doom"
11694,PART III.,Of sacred strength for every age to come.
11695,PART III.,"By this the Doves their wealth and state possess,"
11696,PART III.,"No rights infringed, but licence to oppress:"
11697,PART III.,Such power have they as factious lawyers long
11698,PART III.,"To crowns ascribed, that Kings can do no wrong."
11699,PART III.,But since his own domestic birds have tried                       1240
11700,PART III.,"The dire effects of their destructive pride,"
11701,PART III.,"He deems that proof a measure to the rest,"
11702,PART III.,"Concluding well within his kingly breast,"
11703,PART III.,His fowls of nature too unjustly were oppress'd.
11704,PART III.,He therefore makes all birds of every sect
11705,PART III.,"Free of his farm, with promise to respect"
11706,PART III.,"Their several kinds alike, and equally protect."
11707,PART III.,His gracious edict the same franchise yields
11708,PART III.,"To all the wild increase of woods and fields,"
11709,PART III.,"And who in rocks aloof, and who in steeples builds:               1250"
11710,PART III.,"To Crows the like impartial grace affords,"
11711,PART III.,"And Choughs and Daws, and such republic birds:"
11712,PART III.,"Secured with ample privilege to feed,"
11713,PART III.,"Each has his district, and his bounds decreed;"
11714,PART III.,"Combined in common interest with his own,"
11715,PART III.,But not to pass the Pigeon's Rubicon.
11716,PART III.,
11717,PART III.,Here ends the reign of this pretended Dove;
11718,PART III.,"All prophecies accomplish'd from above,"
11719,PART III.,From Shiloh comes the sceptre to remove.
11720,PART III.,"Reduced from her imperial high abode,                             1260"
11721,PART III.,"Like Dionysius to a private rod,"
11722,PART III.,"The Passive Church, that with pretended grace"
11723,PART III.,"Did her distinctive mark in duty place,"
11724,PART III.,"Now touch'd, reviles her Maker to his face."
11725,PART III.,
11726,PART III.,What after happen'd is not hard to guess:
11727,PART III.,"The small beginnings had a large increase,"
11728,PART III.,"And arts and wealth succeed, the secret spoils of peace."
11729,PART III.,"'Tis said, the Doves repented, though too late,"
11730,PART III.,Become the smiths of their own foolish fate:
11731,PART III.,Nor did their owner hasten their ill hour;                        1270
11732,PART III.,"But, sunk in credit, they decreased in power:"
11733,PART III.,"Like snows in warmth that mildly pass away,"
11734,PART III.,Dissolving in the silence of decay.
11735,PART III.,
11736,PART III.,"The Buzzard, not content with equal place,"
11737,PART III.,Invites the feather'd Nimrods of his race;
11738,PART III.,"To hide the thinness of their flock from sight,"
11739,PART III.,And all together make a seeming goodly flight:
11740,PART III.,But each have separate interests of their own;
11741,PART III.,Two Czars are one too many for a throne.
11742,PART III.,Nor can the usurper long abstain from food;                       1280
11743,PART III.,Already he has tasted Pigeons' blood:
11744,PART III.,"And may be tempted to his former fare,"
11745,PART III.,When this indulgent lord shall late to heaven repair.
11746,PART III.,"Bare benting times, and moulting months may come,"
11747,PART III.,"When, lagging late, they cannot reach their home;"
11748,PART III.,"Or, rent in schism (for so their fate decrees),"
11749,PART III.,"Like the tumultuous college of the bees,[138]"
11750,PART III.,"They fight their quarrel, by themselves oppress'd;"
11751,PART III.,"The tyrant smiles below, and waits the falling feast."
11752,PART III.,
11753,PART III.,"Thus did the gentle Hind her fable end,                          1290"
11754,PART III.,"Nor would the Panther blame it, nor commend;"
11755,PART III.,"But, with affected yawnings at the close,"
11756,PART III.,Seem'd to require her natural repose:
11757,PART III.,For now the streaky light began to peep;
11758,PART III.,And setting stars admonish'd both to sleep.
11759,PART III.,"The dame withdrew, and, wishing to her guest"
11760,PART III.,"The peace of heaven, betook herself to rest."
11761,PART III.,"Ten thousand angels on her slumbers wait,"

11865,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],To teach the nations in thy greater name.
11866,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"My warbling lute, the lute I whilom strung,"
11867,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"When to king John of Portugal I sung,"
11868,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Was but the prelude to that glorious day,"
11869,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"When thou on silver Thames didst cut thy way,"
11870,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"With well-timed oars before the royal barge,"
11871,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge;                     40
11872,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"And big with hymn, commander of an host,"
11873,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets toss'd.
11874,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Methinks I see the new Arion sail,"
11875,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],The lute still trembling underneath thy nail.
11876,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"At thy well-sharpen'd thumb, from shore to shore"
11877,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The trebles squeak for fear, the basses roar:"
11878,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Echoes from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell call,"
11879,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And Shadwell they resound from Aston-Hall.
11880,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"About thy boat the little fishes throng,"
11881,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],As at the morning toast that floats along.                          50
11882,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Sometimes, as prince of thy harmonious band,"
11883,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand.
11884,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"St Andre's[141] feet ne'er kept more equal time,"
11885,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Not even the feet of thy own Psyche's[142] rhyme:
11886,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Though they in number as in sense excel;
11887,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"So just, so like tautology, they fell,"
11888,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"That, pale with envy, Singleton[143] forswore"
11889,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The lute and sword, which he in triumph bore,"
11890,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And vow'd he ne'er would act Villerius more.
11891,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],
11892,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Here stopp'd the good old sire, and wept for joy,               60"
11893,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],In silent raptures of the hopeful boy.
11894,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"All arguments, but most his plays, persuade,"
11895,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],That for anointed dulness he was made.
11896,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],
11897,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind
11898,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"(The fair Augusta much to fears inclined),"
11899,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"An ancient fabric raised to inform the sight,"
11900,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"There stood of yore, and Barbican it hight:"
11901,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"A watch-tower once; but now, so fate ordains,"
11902,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Of all the pile an empty name remains:
11903,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"From its old ruins brothel-houses rise,                             70"
11904,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys,"
11905,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where their vast courts the mother-strumpets keep,"
11906,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"And, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep."
11907,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Near these a Nursery[144] erects its head,"
11908,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred;"
11909,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where unfledged actors learn to laugh and cry,"
11910,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where infant punks their tender voices try,"
11911,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And little Maximins the gods defy.
11912,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here,"
11913,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear;                           80
11914,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],But gentle Simkin[145] just reception finds
11915,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Amidst this monument of vanish'd minds:
11916,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Pure clinches the suburban muse affords,"
11917,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And Panton[146] waging harmless war with words.
11918,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known,"
11919,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Ambitiously design'd his Shadwell's throne.
11920,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"For ancient Decker[147] prophesied long since,"
11921,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"That in this pile should reign a mighty prince,"
11922,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense:"
11923,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"To whom true dulness should some Psyches owe,                       90"
11924,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],But worlds of Misers[148] from his pen should flow;
11925,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Humourists and hypocrites it should produce,"
11926,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Whole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce.[149]"
11927,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],
11928,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Now Empress Fame had publish'd the renown
11929,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Of Shadwell's coronation through the town.
11930,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Roused by report of fame, the nations meet,"
11931,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"From near Bunhill, and distant Watling Street."
11932,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"No Persian carpets spread the imperial way,"
11933,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay:
11934,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"From dusty shops neglected authors come,                           100"
11935,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum."
11936,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby[150] there lay,"
11937,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],But loads of Shadwell almost choked the way.
11938,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Bilk'd stationers for yeomen stood prepared,"
11939,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And Herringman[151] was captain of the guard.
11940,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The hoary prince in majesty appear'd,"
11941,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],High on a throne of his own labours rear'd.
11942,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"At his right hand our young Ascanius sate,"
11943,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Rome's other hope, and pillar of the state."
11944,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,                   110"
11945,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And lambent dulness play'd around his face.
11946,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"As Hannibal did to the altars come,"
11947,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Sworn by his fire, a mortal foe to Rome;"
11948,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain,"
11949,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],That he till death true dulness would maintain;
11950,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"And, in his father's right, and realm's defence,"
11951,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense."
11952,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The king himself the sacred unction made,"
11953,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"As king by office, and as priest by trade."
11954,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"In his sinister hand, instead of ball,                             120"
11955,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],He placed a mighty mug of potent ale;
11956,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Love's Kingdom[152] to his right he did convey,"
11957,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],At once his sceptre and his rule of sway;
11958,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Whose righteous lore the prince had practised young,"
11959,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung.
11960,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"His temples, last, with poppies were o'erspread,"
11961,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head.
11962,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Just at the point of time, if fame not lie,"
11963,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],On his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly.
11964,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's brook,                           130"
11965,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Presage of sway from twice six vultures took.
11966,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The admiring throng loud acclamations make,"
11967,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And omens of his future empire take.
11968,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The sire then shook the honours of his head,"
11969,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"And from his brows damps of oblivion shed,"
11970,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Full on the filial dulness: long he stood,"
11971,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Repelling from his breast the raging god;
11972,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],At length burst out in this prophetic mood:
11973,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],
11974,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Heavens bless my son, from Ireland let him reign"
11975,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],To far Barbadoes on the western main;                              140
11976,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Of his dominion may no end be known,"
11977,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And greater than his father's be his throne;
11978,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Beyond Love's kingdom let him stretch his pen!--
11979,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"He paused, and all the people cried, Amen."
11980,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Then thus continued he: My son, advance"
11981,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Still in new impudence, new ignorance."
11982,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Success let others teach, learn thou from me"
11983,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Pangs without birth, and fruitless industry."
11984,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Let Virtuosos[153] in five years be writ;
11985,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit.                        150
11986,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Let gentle George[154] in triumph tread the stage,"
11987,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;"
11988,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,"
11989,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And in their folly show the writer's wit.
11990,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,"
11991,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And justify their author's want of sense.
11992,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Let them be all by thy own model made
11993,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Of dulness, and desire no foreign aid;"
11994,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"That they to future ages may be known,"
11995,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Not copies drawn, but issue of thy own.                            160"
11996,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Nay, let thy men of wit too be the same,"
11997,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"All full of thee, and differing but in name."
11998,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"But let no alien Sedley[155] interpose,"
11999,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.[156]
12000,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"And when false flowers of rhetoric thou wouldst cull,"
12001,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Trust nature, do not labour to be dull;"
12002,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"But write thy best, and top; and, in each line,"
12003,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Sir Formal's[157] oratory will be thine:
12004,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,"
12005,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And does thy northern dedications fill.                            170
12006,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,"
12007,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],By arrogating Jonson's hostile name.
12008,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Let Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise,"
12009,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.
12010,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part:"
12011,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"What share have we in nature, or in art?"
12012,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,"
12013,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And rail at arts he did not understand?
12014,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where made he love in prince Nicander's[158] vein,"
12015,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain?                       180
12016,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my a--e,"
12017,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Promised a play, and dwindled to a farce?"
12018,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,"
12019,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],As thou whole Etheridge dost transfuse to thine?
12020,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"But so transfused, as oil and waters flow,"
12021,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"His always floats above, thine sinks below."
12022,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"This is thy province, this thy wondrous way,"
12023,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],New humours to invent for each new play:
12024,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"This is that boasted bias of thy mind,"
12025,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],By which one way to dulness 'tis inclined:                         190
12026,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Which makes thy writings lean on one side still,"
12027,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"And, in all changes, that way bends thy will."
12028,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Nor let thy mountain-belly make pretence
12029,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.
12030,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,"
12031,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],But sure thou'rt but a kilderkin of wit.
12032,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Like mine, thy gentle numbers feebly creep;"
12033,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Thy tragic muse gives smiles, thy comic sleep."
12034,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"With whate'er gall thou sett'st thyself to write,"
12035,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Thy inoffensive satires never bite.                                200
12036,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"In thy felonious heart though venom lies,"
12037,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies."
12038,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame
12039,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"In keen Iambics, but mild Anagram."
12040,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Leave writing plays, and choose for thy command,"
12041,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Some peaceful province in Acrostic land.
12042,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"There thou mayst wings display and altars[159] raise,"
12043,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And torture one poor word ten thousand ways.
12044,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Or, if thou wouldst thy different talents suit,"
12045,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.                      210"
12046,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],
12047,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],He said; but his last words were scarcely heard:
12048,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"For Bruce and Longville[160] had a trap prepared,"
12049,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],And down they sent the yet declaiming bard.
12050,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"Sinking he left his drugget robe behind,"
12051,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],Borne upwards by a subterranean wind.
12052,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],"The mantle fell to the young prophet's part,"
12053,MAC FLECKNOE.[139],With double portion of his father's art.
