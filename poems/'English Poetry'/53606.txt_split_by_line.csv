130,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
131,INTRODUCTION.,
132,INTRODUCTION.,
133,INTRODUCTION.,The word Burlesque came to us through the French from the Italian
134,INTRODUCTION.,"""burlesco""; ""burla"" being mockery or raillery, and implying always an"
135,INTRODUCTION.,"object. Burlesque must, _burlarsi di uno_, mock at somebody or something,"
136,INTRODUCTION.,and when intended to give pleasure it is nothing if not good-natured.
137,INTRODUCTION.,"One etymologist associates the word with the old English ""bourd,"" a"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"jest; the Gaelic ""burd,"" he says, means mockery, and ""buirleadh,"" is"
139,INTRODUCTION.,"language of ridicule. Yes, and ""burrail"" is the loud romping of children,"
140,INTRODUCTION.,"and ""burrall"" is weeping and wailing in a deep-toned howl. Another"
141,INTRODUCTION.,"etymologist takes the Italian ""burla,"" waggery or banter, as diminutive"
142,INTRODUCTION.,"from the Latin ""burra,"" which means a rough hair, but is used by Ausonius"
143,INTRODUCTION.,"in the sense of a jest. That etymology no doubt fits burlesque to a hair,"
144,INTRODUCTION.,"but, like Launce's sweetheart, it may have more hair than wit."
145,INTRODUCTION.,
146,INTRODUCTION.,"The first burlesque in this volume--Chaucer's ""Rime of Sir Thopas,"""
147,INTRODUCTION.,written towards the close of the fourteenth century--is a jest upon
148,INTRODUCTION.,"long-winded story-tellers, who expatiate on insignificant detail; for"
149,INTRODUCTION.,in his day there were many metrical romances written by the ancestors
150,INTRODUCTION.,"of Mrs. Nickleby. Riding to Canterbury with the other pilgrims, Chaucer"
151,INTRODUCTION.,good-humouredly takes to himself the part of the companion who jogs along
152,INTRODUCTION.,"with even flow of words, luxuriating in all trivial detail until he"
153,INTRODUCTION.,"brings Sir Thopas face to face with an adventure, for he meets a giant"
154,INTRODUCTION.,with three heads. But even then there is the adventure to be waited for.
155,INTRODUCTION.,The story-teller finds that he must trot his knight back home to fetch
156,INTRODUCTION.,"his armour, and when he ""is comen again to toune,"" it takes so many"
157,INTRODUCTION.,"words to get him his supper, get his armour on, and trot him out again,"
158,INTRODUCTION.,"that the inevitable end comes, with rude intrusion of some faint-hearted"
159,INTRODUCTION.,lording who has not courage to listen until the point of the story can
160,INTRODUCTION.,"be descried from afar. So the best of the old story-tellers, in a book"
161,INTRODUCTION.,"full of examples of tales told as they should be, burlesqued misuse of"
162,INTRODUCTION.,"his art, and the ""Rime of Sir Thopas"" became a warning buoy over the"
163,INTRODUCTION.,"shallows. ""I cannot,"" said Sir Thomas Wyatt, in Henry VIII.'s reign,"
164,INTRODUCTION.,
165,INTRODUCTION.,"""say that Pan"
166,INTRODUCTION.,Passeth Apollo in music manyfold;
167,INTRODUCTION.,"Praisé Sir Thopas for a noble tale,"
168,INTRODUCTION.,"And scorn the story that the Knighté told."""
169,INTRODUCTION.,
170,INTRODUCTION.,"The second burlesque in this volume, Beaumont and Fletcher's ""Knight of"
171,INTRODUCTION.,"the Burning Pestle,"" written in eight days, appeared in 1611, six years"
172,INTRODUCTION.,"after the publication of the First Part, and four years earlier than"
173,INTRODUCTION.,"the Second Part, of Don Quixote. The first English translation of Don"
174,INTRODUCTION.,Quixote (Shelton's) appeared in 1612. The Knight of the Burning Pestle
175,INTRODUCTION.,"is, like Don Quixote, a burlesque upon the tasteless affectations of the"
176,INTRODUCTION.,tales of chivalry. Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher worked together as
177,INTRODUCTION.,playwrights in the reign of James I. All their plays were produced during
178,INTRODUCTION.,"that reign. Beaumont died in the same year as Shakespeare, having written"
179,INTRODUCTION.,thirteen plays in fellowship with Fletcher. Forty more were written by
180,INTRODUCTION.,"Fletcher alone, but the name of Beaumont is, by tradition of a loving"
181,INTRODUCTION.,"fellowship, associated with them all. ""The Knight of the Burning Pestle"""
182,INTRODUCTION.,is all the merrier for being the work of men who were themselves true
183,INTRODUCTION.,poets. It should be remembered that this play was written for a theatre
184,INTRODUCTION.,"without scenery, in which gentlemen were allowed to hire stools on the"
185,INTRODUCTION.,stage itself for a nearer view of the actors; and it is among this select
186,INTRODUCTION.,part of the audience that the citizen intrudes and the citizen's wife
187,INTRODUCTION.,"is lifted up, when she cries, ""Husband, shall I come up, husband?"" ""Ay,"
188,INTRODUCTION.,"cony; Ralph, help your mistress up this way; pray, gentlemen, make her a"
189,INTRODUCTION.,"little room; I pray you, sir, lend me your hand to help up my wife...."
190,INTRODUCTION.,"Boy, let my wife and I have a couple of stools, and then begin."""
191,INTRODUCTION.,
192,INTRODUCTION.,"The next burlesque in our collection is ""The Rehearsal,"" which was"
193,INTRODUCTION.,"produced in 1671 to ridicule the extravagance of the ""heroic"" plays of"
194,INTRODUCTION.,the Restoration. The founder of this school in England was Sir William
195,INTRODUCTION.,"Davenant who was living and was Poet Laureate--and wearer of the bays,"
196,INTRODUCTION.,"therefore, was Bayes--when the jest was begun by George Villiers, Duke"
197,INTRODUCTION.,"of Buckingham, and other wits of the day. The jest was so long in hand"
198,INTRODUCTION.,"that, in 1668, when Davenant died, and Dryden succeeded him as Laureate,"
199,INTRODUCTION.,the character of Bayes passed on to him. The plaster on the nose pointed
200,INTRODUCTION.,"at Davenant, who had lost great part of his nose. The manner of speaking,"
201,INTRODUCTION.,"and the ""hum and buzz,"" pointed at Dryden, who was also in 1671 the"
202,INTRODUCTION.,"great master of what was called heroic drama. Bold rhodomontade was,"
203,INTRODUCTION.,"on the stage, preferred to good sense at a time when the new French"
204,INTRODUCTION.,"criticism was enforcing above all things ""good sense"" upon poets, as a"
205,INTRODUCTION.,reaction against the strained ingenuities that had come in under Italian
206,INTRODUCTION.,"influence. Let us leave to Italy her paste brilliants, said Boileau, in"
207,INTRODUCTION.,"his _Art Poétique_, produced at the same time as ""The Rehearsal,"" all"
208,INTRODUCTION.,should tend to good sense. But Dryden in his plays (not in his other
209,INTRODUCTION.,"poems) boldly translated Horace's _serbit humi tutus_, into"
210,INTRODUCTION.,
211,INTRODUCTION.,"""He who servilely creeps after sense"
212,INTRODUCTION.,"Is safe, but ne'er will reach an excellence."""
213,INTRODUCTION.,
214,INTRODUCTION.,The particular excellence attained by flying out of sight of sense is
215,INTRODUCTION.,"burlesqued in the Duke of Buckingham's ""Rehearsal."""
216,INTRODUCTION.,
217,INTRODUCTION.,"John Philips, the delicate and gentle son of a vicar of Bampton, read"
218,INTRODUCTION.,Milton with delight from his boyhood and knew Virgil almost by heart. At
219,INTRODUCTION.,"college he wrote, for the edification of a comrade who did not know how"
220,INTRODUCTION.,"to keep a shilling in his pocket, ""The Splendid Shilling,"" a poem first"
221,INTRODUCTION.,"published in 1705--which set forth, in Miltonic style applied to humblest"
222,INTRODUCTION.,"images, the comfort of possessing such a coin. The Miltonic grandeur of"
223,INTRODUCTION.,tone John Philips happily caught from a long and loving study of the
224,INTRODUCTION.,"English poet whom he reverenced above others, and ""The Splendid Shilling"""
225,INTRODUCTION.,has a special charm as a burlesque in which nobody is ridiculed.
226,INTRODUCTION.,
227,INTRODUCTION.,"The burlesque poem called ""Namby Pamby,"" of which the title has been"
228,INTRODUCTION.,"added to the English vocabulary, was written by Henry Carey, in ridicule"
229,INTRODUCTION.,of the little rhymes inscribed to certain babies of distinguished
230,INTRODUCTION.,"persons by Ambrose Philips, or, as he is translated into nursery"
231,INTRODUCTION.,"language, ""Namby Pamby Pilli-pis."" Ambrose Philips was a friend and"
232,INTRODUCTION.,"companion of Addison's, and a gentleman who prospered fairly in Whig"
233,INTRODUCTION.,government circles. Pope's annoyance at the praise given to Ambrose
234,INTRODUCTION.,"Philips's pastorals which appeared in the same Miscellany with his own,"
235,INTRODUCTION.,and Addison's praise in the _Spectator_ of his friend's translation of
236,INTRODUCTION.,"Racine's Andromache as ""The Distrest Mother,"" have caused Ambrose Philips"
237,INTRODUCTION.,to be better remembered in the history of literature than might otherwise
238,INTRODUCTION.,have been necessary. When he wrote no longer of
239,INTRODUCTION.,
240,INTRODUCTION.,"""Mammy"
241,INTRODUCTION.,Andromache and her lammy
242,INTRODUCTION.,Hanging panging at the breast
243,INTRODUCTION.,"Of a matron most distrest."""
244,INTRODUCTION.,
245,INTRODUCTION.,"and took to nursery lyrics, he gave Henry Carey an opportunity of putting"
246,INTRODUCTION.,a last touch to his monument for the instruction of posterity. The two
247,INTRODUCTION.,"specimens here given of the original poems that suggested ""Namby Pamby"""
248,INTRODUCTION.,"are addressed severally to two babes in the nursery of Daniel Pulteney,"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"Esq. Another of the babies who inspired him was an infant Carteret,"
250,INTRODUCTION.,"whose name Carey translated into ""Tartaretta Tartaree."" Some lines here"
251,INTRODUCTION.,"and there, seven in all, which are not the wittier for being coarse,"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"have been left out of ""Namby Pamby."" This burlesque was first published"
253,INTRODUCTION.,"in 1725 or 1726; my copy is of the fifth edition, dated 1726, and was"
254,INTRODUCTION.,"appended to ""A Learned Dissertation on Dumpling; its Dignity, Antiquity,"
255,INTRODUCTION.,"and Excellence, with a Word upon Pudding, and many other Useful"
256,INTRODUCTION.,"Discoveries of great Benefit to the Publick. To which is added, Namby"
257,INTRODUCTION.,"Pamby, A Panegyric on the new Versification address'd to A---- P----,"
258,INTRODUCTION.,"Esq."""
259,INTRODUCTION.,
260,INTRODUCTION.,"Henry Fielding produced his ""Tom Thumb"" in 1730, and added the notes of"
261,INTRODUCTION.,"Scriblerus Secundus in 1731, following the example set by the Dunciad as"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"published in April 1729, with the ""Prolegomena of Scriblerus and Notes"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"Variorum."" Paul Whitehead added notes of a Scriblerus Tertius to his"
264,INTRODUCTION.,"""Gymnasiad"" in 1744. Fielding was twenty-four years old when he added"
265,INTRODUCTION.,"to his ""Tom Thumb"" the notes that transmit to us lively examples of the"
266,INTRODUCTION.,"stilted language of the stage by which, as a gentleman's son left to his"
267,INTRODUCTION.,"own resources, he was then endeavouring to live. This was four years"
268,INTRODUCTION.,"before his marriage, and ten years before he revealed his transcendent"
269,INTRODUCTION.,powers as a novelist.
270,INTRODUCTION.,
271,INTRODUCTION.,"Henry Carey's ""Chrononhotonthologos,"" three years later, in 1734, carried"
272,INTRODUCTION.,on the war against pretentious dulness on the stage. The manner of
273,INTRODUCTION.,"the great actors was, like the plays of their generation, pompous and"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"rhetorical, full of measured sound and fury signifying nothing. Garrick,"
275,INTRODUCTION.,"who made his first appearance as an actor in 1741, put an end to this."
276,INTRODUCTION.,"""If the young fellow is right,"" said Quin, ""We are all in the wrong;"""
277,INTRODUCTION.,"little suspecting that they really were all in the wrong. Henry Carey,"
278,INTRODUCTION.,"a musician by profession, played in the orchestra and also supplied the"
279,INTRODUCTION.,stage with ballad and burlesque farces and operas. But also he wrote
280,INTRODUCTION.,"""Namby Pamby."" It was said of him that ""he led a life free from reproach,"
281,INTRODUCTION.,"and hanged himself October 4th, 1743."""
282,INTRODUCTION.,
283,INTRODUCTION.,"""The Rovers, or the Double Arrangement,"" was a contribution to ""The"
284,INTRODUCTION.,"Anti-Jacobin,"" by George Canning, and his friends George Ellis and John"
285,INTRODUCTION.,"Hookham Frere. Canning had established ""The Anti-Jacobin,"" of which the"
286,INTRODUCTION.,"first number was published on the 20th of November, 1797. Its poetry,"
287,INTRODUCTION.,generally levelled through witty burlesque at the false sentiment of the
288,INTRODUCTION.,"day, was collected in 1801 into a handsome quarto. This includes ""The"
289,INTRODUCTION.,"Rovers,"" which is a lively caricature of the sentimental German drama."
290,INTRODUCTION.,"Goethe's ""Stella,"" as read in the translation used by the caricaturists,"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"is not less comical than the caricature. I have a copy of the ""Poetry"
292,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Anti-Jacobin,"" in which one of the original writers has, for the"
293,INTRODUCTION.,"friend to whom he gave the book, marked with his pen and ink details of"
294,INTRODUCTION.,authorship. From this it appears that the description of the _dramatis
295,INTRODUCTION.,"personæ_ in ""The Rovers"" was by Frere, the Prologue by Canning and Ellis,"
296,INTRODUCTION.,"the opening scene by Frere as far as Rogero's famous song, which was by"
297,INTRODUCTION.,Canning and Ellis. All that follows to the beginning of the fourth act
298,INTRODUCTION.,"was by Canning, except that Frere wrote the scene in the second act on"
299,INTRODUCTION.,the delivery of a newspaper to Beefington and Puddingfield. The fourth
300,INTRODUCTION.,"act and the final stage directions were by Frere, except the Recitative"
301,INTRODUCTION.,and Chorus of Conspirators. These were by George Ellis.
302,INTRODUCTION.,
303,INTRODUCTION.,"""Bombastes Furioso,"" first produced in 1810, was by William Barnes"
304,INTRODUCTION.,"Rhodes, who had published a translation of Juvenal in 1801 and ""Epigrams"""
305,INTRODUCTION.,"in 1803. He formed a considerable dramatic library, of which there was a"
306,INTRODUCTION.,catalogue printed in 1825.
307,INTRODUCTION.,
308,INTRODUCTION.,Next comes in this collection the series of burlesques of the styles of
309,INTRODUCTION.,"poets famous and popular in 1812, published in that year as ""Rejected"
310,INTRODUCTION.,"Addresses,"" by Horace and James Smith. Of these brothers, sons of"
311,INTRODUCTION.,"an attorney, one was an attorney, the other a stockbroker, one aged"
312,INTRODUCTION.,"thirty-seven, the other thirty-three, when the book appeared which made"
313,INTRODUCTION.,"them famous, and of which the first edition is reprinted in this volume."
314,INTRODUCTION.,"The book went through twenty-four editions. James Smith wrote no more,"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"but Horace to the last amused himself with literature. ""Is it not odd,"""
316,INTRODUCTION.,"Leigh Hunt wrote of him to Shelley, ""that the only truly generous person"
317,INTRODUCTION.,"I ever knew, who had money to be generous with, was a stockbroker! And"
318,INTRODUCTION.,"he writes poetry too; he writes poetry, and pastoral dramas, and yet"
319,INTRODUCTION.,"knows how to make money, and does make it, and is still generous."" The"
320,INTRODUCTION.,Fitzgerald who is subject of the first burlesque used to recite his
321,INTRODUCTION.,"laudatory poems at the annual dinners of the Literary Fund, and is the"
322,INTRODUCTION.,"same who was referred to in the opening lines of Byron's ""English Bards"
323,INTRODUCTION.,"and Scotch Reviewers:"""
324,INTRODUCTION.,
325,INTRODUCTION.,"""Still must I hear?--shall hoarse Fitzgerald bawl"
326,INTRODUCTION.,"His creaking couplets in a tavern hall,"
327,INTRODUCTION.,"And I not sing."""
328,INTRODUCTION.,
329,INTRODUCTION.,"This Miscellany closes with some of the ""Odes and Addresses to Great"
330,INTRODUCTION.,"People,"" with which Thomas Hood, at the age of twenty-six, first made his"
331,INTRODUCTION.,mark as a wit. The little book from which these pieces are taken was the
332,INTRODUCTION.,"joint work of himself and John Hamilton Reynolds, whose sister he had"
333,INTRODUCTION.,married. It marks the rise of the pun in burlesque writing through Thomas
334,INTRODUCTION.,"Hood, who, when dying of consumption, suggested for his epitaph, ""Here"
335,INTRODUCTION.,"lies one who spat more blood and made more puns than any other man."""

4006,ACT V.--SCENE I.,"Huge Barbaroso, that insulting giant,"
4007,ACT V.--SCENE I.,And all his captives soon set at liberty.
4008,ACT V.--SCENE I.,Then honour prick'd me from my native soil
4009,ACT V.--SCENE I.,"Into Moldavia, where I gain'd the love"
4010,ACT V.--SCENE I.,"Of Pompiana, his beloved daughter;"

4013,ACT V.--SCENE I.,"Yet liberal I was, and gave her pins,"
4014,ACT V.--SCENE I.,And money for her father's officers.
4015,ACT V.--SCENE I.,"I then returnéd home, and thrust myself"

4183,ACT I.--SCENE I.,

4200,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"to chat with in the afternoon, and sometimes see a play; where there are"
4201,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"such things, Frank, such hideous, monstrous things, that it has almost"
4202,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"made me forswear the stage, and resolve to apply myself to the solid"

4262,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"virgin attire; though, perhaps, it may blush, I shall not be ashamed to"
4263,ACT I.--SCENE I.,discover its nakedness unto you. I think it is in this pocket. [_Puts his

4277,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4278,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, some certain helps that we men of art have found it"

4280,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4281,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ How, sir, helps for wit?"
4282,ACT I.--SCENE I.,

4285,ACT I.--SCENE I.,except it were by the help of these my rules.[2]
4286,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4287,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ What are those rules, I pray?"
4288,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4289,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, my first rule is the rule of transversion, or Regula"
4290,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"Duplex; changing verse into prose, or prose into verse, _alternativè_ as"
4291,ACT I.--SCENE I.,you please.
4292,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4293,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Well; but how is this done by a rule, sir?"
4294,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4295,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why thus, sir; nothing so easy when understood. I take a book in"
4296,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"my hand, either at home or elsewhere, for that's all one; if there be any"
4297,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"wit in't, as there is no book but has some, I transverse it; that is, if"
4298,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"it be prose, put it into verse (but that takes up some time), and if it"
4299,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"be verse, put it into prose."
4300,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4301,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Methinks, Mr. Bayes, that putting verse into prose should be"
4302,ACT I.--SCENE I.,called transprosing.
4303,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4304,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ By my troth, sir, 'tis a very good notion; and hereafter it"
4305,ACT I.--SCENE I.,shall be so.
4306,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4307,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Well, sir, and what d'ye do with it then?"
4308,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4309,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Make it my own. 'Tis so changed that no man can know it. My next
4310,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"rule is the rule of record, by way of table-book. Pray observe."
4311,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4312,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ We hear you, sir; go on."
4313,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4314,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ As thus. I come into a coffee-house, or some other place where"
4315,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"witty men resort, I make as if I minded nothing; do you mark? but as soon"
4316,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"as any one speaks, pop I slap it down, and make that too my own."
4317,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4318,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ But, Mr. Bayes, are you not sometimes in danger of their making"
4319,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"you restore, by force, what you have gotten thus by art?"
4320,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4321,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, sir; the world's unmindful: they never take notice of these"
4322,ACT I.--SCENE I.,things.
4323,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4324,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ But pray, Mr. Bayes, among all your other rules, have you no one"
4325,ACT I.--SCENE I.,rule for invention?
4326,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4327,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Yes, sir, that's my third rule that I have here in my pocket."
4328,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4329,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ What rule can that be, I wonder?"
4330,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4331,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, when I have anything to invent, I never trouble my"
4332,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"head about it, as other men do; but presently turn over this book,"
4333,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"and there I have, at one view, all that Persius, Montaigne, Seneca's"
4334,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"Tragedies, Horace, Juvenal, Claudian, Pliny, Plutarch's Lives, and the"
4335,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"rest, have ever thought upon this subject: and so, in a trice, by leaving"
4336,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"out a few words, or putting in others of my own, the business is done."
4337,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4338,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Indeed, Mr. Bayes, this is as sure and compendious a way of wit"
4339,ACT I.--SCENE I.,as ever I heard of.
4340,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4341,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Sir, if you make the least scruples of the efficacy of these my"
4342,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"rules, do but come to the playhouse, and you shall judge of 'em by the"
4343,ACT I.--SCENE I.,effects.
4344,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4345,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ We'll follow you, sir. [_Exeunt._"
4346,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4347,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Enter three_ PLAYERS _on the stage_.
4348,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4349,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_1st Play._ Have you your part perfect?
4350,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4351,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_2nd Play._ Yes, I have it without book; but I don't understand how it is"
4352,ACT I.--SCENE I.,to be spoken.
4353,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4354,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_3rd Play._ And mine is such a one, as I can't guess for my life what"
4355,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"humour I'm to be in; whether angry, melancholy, merry, or in love. I"
4356,ACT I.--SCENE I.,don't know what to make on't.
4357,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4358,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_1st Play._ Phoo! the author will be here presently, and he'll tell us"
4359,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"all. You must know, this is the new way of writing, and these hard things"
4360,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"please forty times better than the old plain way. For, look you, sir,"
4361,ACT I.--SCENE I.,the grand design upon the stage is to keep the auditors in suspense; for
4362,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"to guess presently at the plot, and the sense, tires them before the end"
4363,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"of the first act: now here, every line surprises you, and brings in new"
4364,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"matter. And then, for scenes, clothes, and dances, we put quite down all"
4365,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"that ever went before us; and those are the things, you know, that are"
4366,ACT I.--SCENE I.,essential to a play.
4367,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4368,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_2nd Play._ Well, I am not of thy mind; but, so it gets us money, 'tis no"
4369,ACT I.--SCENE I.,great matter.
4370,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4371,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Enter_ BAYES, JOHNSON, _and_ SMITH."
4372,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4373,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Come, come in, gentlemen. You're very welcome, Mr.--a--. Ha' you"
4374,ACT I.--SCENE I.,your part ready?
4375,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4376,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_1st Play._ Yes, sir."
4377,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4378,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ But do you understand the true humour of it?
4379,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4380,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_1st Play._ Ay, sir, pretty well."
4381,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4382,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ And Amaryllis, how does she do? does not her armour become her?"
4383,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4384,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_3rd Play._ Oh, admirably!"
4385,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4386,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ I'll tell you now a pretty conceit. What do you think I'll make
4387,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"'em call her anon, in this play?"
4388,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4389,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ What, I pray?"
4390,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4391,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, I make 'em call her Armaryllis, because of her armour: ha,"
4392,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"ha, ha!"
4393,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4394,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ That will be very well indeed.
4395,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4396,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Ay, 'tis a pretty little rogue; but--a--come, let's sit down."
4397,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"Look you, sirs, the chief hinge of this play, upon which the whole"
4398,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"plot moves and turns, and that causes the variety of all the several"
4399,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"accidents, which, you know, are the things in nature that make up the"
4400,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"grand refinement of a play, is, that I suppose two kings of the same"
4401,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"place; as for example, at Brentford, for I love to write familiarly. Now"
4402,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"the people having the same relations to 'em both, the same affections,"
4403,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"the same duty, the same obedience, and all that, are divided among"
4404,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"themselves in point of devoir and interest, how to behave themselves"
4405,ACT I.--SCENE I.,equally between 'em: these kings differing sometimes in particular;
4406,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"though, in the main, they agree. (I know not whether I make myself well"
4407,ACT I.--SCENE I.,understood.)
4408,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4409,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ I did not observe you, sir: pray say that again."
4410,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4411,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, look you, sir (nay, I beseech you be a little curious in"
4412,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"taking notice of this, or else you'll never understand my notion of"
4413,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"the thing), the people being embarrass'd by their equal ties to both,"
4414,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"and the sovereigns concern'd in a reciprocal regard, as well to their"
4415,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"own interest, as the good of the people, make a certain kind of a--you"
4416,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"understand me--upon which, there do arise several disputes, turmoils,"
4417,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"heart-burnings, and all that--in fine, you'll apprehend it better when"
4418,ACT I.--SCENE I.,you see it.
4419,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4420,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"[_Exit, to call the Players._"
4421,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4422,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ I find the author will be very much obliged to the players, if"
4423,ACT I.--SCENE I.,they can make any sense out of this.
4424,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4425,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Enter_ BAYES.
4426,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4427,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Now, gentlemen, I would fain ask your opinion of one thing."
4428,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"I have made a prologue and an epilogue, which may both serve for"
4429,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"either; that is, the prologue for the epilogue, or the epilogue for the"
4430,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"prologue;[3] (do you mark?) nay, they may both serve too, egad, for any"
4431,ACT I.--SCENE I.,other play as well as this.
4432,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4433,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ Very well; that's indeed artificial.
4434,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4435,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ And I would fain ask your judgments, now, which of them would"
4436,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"do best for the prologue? for, you must know there is, in nature, but"
4437,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"two ways of making very good prologues: the one is by civility, by"
4438,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"insinuation, good language, and all that, to--a--in a manner, steal your"
4439,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"plaudit from the courtesy of the auditors: the other, by making use of"
4440,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"some certain personal things, which may keep a hank upon such censuring"
4441,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"persons, as cannot otherways, egad, in nature, be hindered from being"
4442,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"too free with their tongues. To which end, my first prologue is, that I"
4443,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"come out in a long black veil, and a great huge hangman behind me, with a"
4444,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"furr'd cap, and his sword drawn; and there tell 'em plainly, that if out"
4445,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"of good-nature, they will not like my play, egad, I'll e'en kneel down,"
4446,ACT I.--SCENE I.,and he shall cut my head off. Whereupon they all clapping--a--
4447,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4448,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Ay, but suppose they don't."
4449,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4450,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Suppose! sir, you may suppose what you please; I have nothing"
4451,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"to do with your suppose, sir; nor am at all mortified at it; not at all,"
4452,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"sir; egad, not one jot, sir. Suppose, quoth-a!--ha, ha, ha! [_Walks away._"
4453,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4454,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Phoo! prithee, Bayes, don't mind what he says; he is a fellow"
4455,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"newly come out of the country, he knows nothing of what's the relish,"
4456,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"here, of the town."
4457,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4458,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ If I writ, sir, to please the country, I should have follow'd"
4459,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"the old plain way; but I write for some persons of quality, and peculiar"
4460,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"friends of mine, that understand what flame and power in writing is; and"
4461,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"they do me the right, sir, to approve of what I do."
4462,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4463,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Ay, ay, they will clap, I warrant you; never fear it."
4464,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4465,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ I'm sure the design's good; that cannot be denied. And then,"
4466,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"for language, egad, I defy 'em all, in nature, to mend it. Besides, sir,"
4467,ACT I.--SCENE I.,I have printed above a hundred sheets of paper to insinuate the plot
4468,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"into the boxes;[4] and, withal, have appointed two or three dozen of my"
4469,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"friends to be ready in the pit, who, I'm sure, will clap, and so the"
4470,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"rest, you know, must follow; and then, pray, sir, what becomes of your"
4471,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"suppose? Ha, ha, ha!"
4472,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4473,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Nay, if the business be so well laid, it cannot miss."
4474,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4475,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ I think so, sir; and therefore would choose this to be the"
4476,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"prologue. For, if I could engage 'em to clap, before they see the play,"
4477,ACT I.--SCENE I.,you know it would be so much the better; because then they were engag'd;
4478,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"for let a man write ever so well, there are, now-a-days, a sort of"
4479,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"persons they call critics, that, egad, have no more wit in them than so"
4480,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"many hobby-horses; but they'll laugh at you, sir, and find fault, and"
4481,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"censure things that, egad, I'm sure, they are not able to do themselves."
4482,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"A sort of envious persons that emulate the glories of persons of parts,"
4483,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"and think to build their fame by calumniating of persons[5] that, egad,"
4484,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"to my knowledge, of all persons in the world, are, in nature, the persons"
4485,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"that do as much despise all that as--a-- In fine, I'll say no more of 'em."
4486,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4487,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Nay, you have said enough of 'em, in all conscience; I'm sure"
4488,ACT I.--SCENE I.,more than they'll e'er be able to answer.
4489,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4490,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, I'll tell you, sir, sincerely and _bonâ fide_, were it not"
4491,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"for the sake of some ingenious persons and choice female spirits, that"
4492,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"have a value for me, I would see 'em all hang'd, egad, before I would"
4493,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"e'er more set pen to paper, but let 'em live in ignorance like ingrates."
4494,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4495,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Ay, marry! that were a way to be reveng'd of 'em indeed; and, if"
4496,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"I were in your place, now, I would do so."
4497,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4498,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, sir; there are certain ties upon me that I cannot be"
4499,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"disengag'd from;[6] otherwise, I would. But pray, sir, how do you like my"
4500,ACT I.--SCENE I.,hangman?
4501,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4502,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ By my troth, sir, I should like him very well."
4503,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4504,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ By how do you like it, sir? (for, I see, you can judge) would"
4505,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"you have it for a prologue, or the epilogue?"
4506,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4507,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Faith, sir, 'tis so good, let it e'en serve for both."
4508,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4509,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, no; that won't do. Besides, I have made another."
4510,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4511,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ What other, sir?"
4512,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4513,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, my other is Thunder and Lightning."
4514,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4515,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ That's greater; I'd rather stick to that.
4516,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4517,ACT I.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Do you think so? I'll tell you then; tho' there have been many
4518,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"witty prologues written of late, yet, I think, you'll say this is a _non"
4519,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"pareillo_: I'm sure nobody has hit upon it yet. For here, sir, I make"
4520,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"my prologue to be a dialogue; and as, in my first, you see, I strive to"
4521,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"oblige the auditors by civility, by good nature, good language, and all"
4522,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"that; so, in this, by the other way, _in terrorem_, I choose for the"
4523,ACT I.--SCENE I.,persons Thunder and Lightning. Do you apprehend the conceit?
4524,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4525,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Phoo, phoo! then you have it cock-sure. They'll be hang'd before"
4526,ACT I.--SCENE I.,they'll dare affront an author that has 'em at that lock.
4527,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4528,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ I have made, too, one of the most delicate dainty similes in the"
4529,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"whole world, egad, if I knew but how to apply it."
4530,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4531,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Let's hear it, I pray you."
4532,ACT I.--SCENE I.,

4538,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"Pensive in mud they wallow all alone,"

4540,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4541,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"How do you like it now, ha?"
4542,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4543,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Faith, 'tis extraordinary fine; and very applicable to Thunder"
4544,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"and Lightning, methinks, because it speaks of a storm."
4545,ACT I.--SCENE I.,
4546,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Egad, and so it does, now I think on't: Mr. Johnson, I thank"
4547,ACT I.--SCENE I.,"you; and I'll put it in _profecto_. Come out, Thunder and Lightning."
4548,ACT I.--SCENE I.,

4645,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Ush._ Come.
4646,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4647,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Phys._ Come.
4648,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4649,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Pray, sir, who are those so very civil persons?"
4650,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4651,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, the gentleman-usher and physician of the two kings of"
4652,ACT II.--SCENE I.,Brentford.
4653,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4654,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ But, pray then, how comes it to pass, that they know one another"
4655,ACT II.--SCENE I.,no better?
4656,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4657,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Phoo! that's for the better carrying on of the plot.
4658,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4659,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ Very well.
4660,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4661,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Phys._ Sir, to conclude."
4662,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4663,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ What, before he begins?"
4664,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4665,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, sir, you must know they had been talking of this a pretty"
4666,ACT II.--SCENE I.,while without.
4667,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4668,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ Where? in the tyring-room?
4669,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4670,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, ay, sir. He's so dull! come, speak again."
4671,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4672,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Phys._ Sir, to conclude, the place you fill has more than amply exacted"
4673,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"the talents of a wary pilot; and all these threat'ning storms, which,"
4674,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"like impregnate clouds, hover o'er our heads, will (when they once are"
4675,ACT II.--SCENE I.,grasped but by the eye of reason) melt into fruitful showers of blessings
4676,ACT II.--SCENE I.,on the people.
4677,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4678,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Pray mark that allegory. Is not that good?
4679,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4680,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Yes, that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable."
4681,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4682,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Phys._ But yet some rumours great are stirring; and if Lorenzo
4683,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"should prove false (which none but the great gods can tell), you"
4684,ACT II.--SCENE I.,then perhaps would find that----               [_Whispers._
4685,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4686,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Now he whispers.
4687,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4688,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Ush._ Alone do you say?
4689,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4690,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Phys._ No, attended with the noble----        [_Whispers._"
4691,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4692,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Again.
4693,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4694,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Ush._ Who, he in grey?"
4695,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4696,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Phys._ Yes, and at the head of----            [_Whispers._"
4697,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4698,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Pray mark.
4699,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4700,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Ush._ Then, sir, most certain 'twill in time appear,"
4701,ACT II.--SCENE I.,These are the reasons that have mov'd him to't;
4702,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"First, he----                                  [_Whispers._"
4703,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4704,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Now the other whispers.
4705,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4706,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Ush._ Secondly, they----                      [_Whispers._"
4707,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4708,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ At it still.
4709,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4710,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Ush._ Thirdly, and lastly, both he and they---- [_Whispers._"
4711,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4712,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Now they both whisper. [_Exeunt whispering._ Now, gentlemen,"
4713,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"pray tell me true, and without flattery, is not this a very odd beginning"
4714,ACT II.--SCENE I.,of a play?
4715,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4716,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ In troth, I think it is, sir. But why two kings of the same"
4717,ACT II.--SCENE I.,place?
4718,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4719,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, because it's new, and that's it I aim at. I despise your"
4720,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"Jonson and Beaumont, that borrowed all they writ from nature: I am for"
4721,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"fetching it purely out of my own fancy, I."
4722,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4723,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ But what think you of Sir John Suckling?
4724,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4725,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ By gad, I am a better poet than he."
4726,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4727,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Well, sir, but pray why all this whispering?"
4728,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4729,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir (besides that it is new, as I told you before), because"
4730,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"they are supposed to be politicians, and matters of state ought not to be"
4731,ACT II.--SCENE I.,divulg'd.
4732,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4733,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ But then, sir, why----"
4734,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4735,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Sir, if you'll but respite your curiosity till the end of the"
4736,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"fifth act, you'll find it a piece of patience not ill recompensed."
4737,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4738,ACT II.--SCENE I.,[_Goes to the door._
4739,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4740,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ How dost thou like this, Frank? Is it not just as I told thee?"
4741,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4742,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Why, I never did before this see anything in nature, and all"
4743,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"that (as Mr. Bayes says) so foolish, but I could give some guess at what"
4744,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"moved the fop to do it; but this, I confess, does go beyond my reach."
4745,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4746,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ It is all alike; Mr. Wintershull[12] has informed me of this
4747,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"play already. And I'll tell thee, Frank, thou shalt not see one scene"
4748,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"here worth one farthing, or like anything thou canst imagine has ever"
4749,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"been the practice of the world. And then, when he comes to what he calls"
4750,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"good language, it is, as I told thee, very fantastical, most abominably"
4751,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"dull, and not one word to the purpose."
4752,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4753,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ It does surprise me, I'm sure, very much."
4754,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4755,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Ay, but it won't do so long: by that time thou hast seen a play"
4756,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"or two, that I'll show thee, thou wilt be pretty well acquainted with"
4757,ACT II.--SCENE I.,this new kind of foppery.
4758,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4759,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Plague on't, but there's no pleasure in him: he's too gross a"
4760,ACT II.--SCENE I.,fool to be laugh'd at.
4761,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4762,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Enter_ BAYES.
4763,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4764,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ I'll swear, Mr. Bayes, you have done this scene most admirably;"
4765,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"tho' I must tell you, sir, it is a very difficult matter to pen a whisper"
4766,ACT II.--SCENE I.,well.
4767,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4768,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Ay, gentlemen, when you come to write yourselves, on my word,"
4769,ACT II.--SCENE I.,you'll find it so.
4770,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4771,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Have a care of what you say, Mr. Bayes; for Mr. Smith there, I"
4772,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"assure you, has written a great many fine things already."
4773,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4774,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Has he, i'fackins? why then pray, sir, how do you do when you"
4775,ACT II.--SCENE I.,write?
4776,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4777,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Faith, sir, for the most part, I am in pretty good health."
4778,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4779,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Ay, but I mean, what do you do when you write?"
4780,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4781,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ I take pen, ink, and paper, and sit down."
4782,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4783,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Now I write standing; that's one thing; and then another thing
4784,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"is, with what do you prepare yourself?"
4785,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4786,ACT II.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ Prepare myself! what the devil does the fool mean?
4787,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4788,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, I'll tell you, now, what I do. If I am to write familiar"
4789,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"things, as sonnets to Armida, and the like, I make use of stew'd prunes"
4790,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"only: but, when I have a grand design in hand, I ever take physic, and"
4791,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"let blood; for, when you would have pure swiftness of thought, and fiery"
4792,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"flights of fancy, you must have a care of the pensive part. In fine, you"
4793,ACT II.--SCENE I.,must purge the stomach.
4794,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4795,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ By my troth, sir, this is a most admirable receipt for writing."
4796,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4797,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Ay, 'tis my secret; and, in good earnest, I think one of the"
4798,ACT II.--SCENE I.,best I have.
4799,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4800,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ In good faith, sir, and that may very well be."
4801,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4802,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ May be, sir? Egad, I'm sure on't: _Experto crede Roberto._ But I"
4803,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"must give you this caution by the way, be sure you never take snuff,[13]"
4804,ACT II.--SCENE I.,when you write.
4805,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4806,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Why so, sir?"
4807,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4808,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, it spoil'd me once, egad, one of the sparkishest plays in"
4809,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"all England. But a friend of mine, at Gresham College, has promised to"
4810,ACT II.--SCENE I.,"help me to some spirit of brains, and, egad, that shall do my business."
4811,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4812,ACT II.--SCENE I.,
4813,SCENE II.,SCENE II.
4814,SCENE II.,
4815,SCENE II.,"_Enter the two_ KINGS, _hand in hand_."
4816,SCENE II.,
4817,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Oh, these are now the two kings of Brentford; take notice of"
4818,SCENE II.,"their style, 'twas never yet upon the stage: but if you like it, I could"
4819,SCENE II.,"make a shift perhaps to show you a whole play, writ all just so."
4820,SCENE II.,
4821,SCENE II.,"_1st King._ Did you observe their whispers, brother king?"
4822,SCENE II.,
4823,SCENE II.,"_2nd King._ I did, and heard, besides, a grave bird sing,"
4824,SCENE II.,"That they intend, sweetheart, to play us pranks."
4825,SCENE II.,
4826,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ This is now familiar, because they are both persons of the same"
4827,SCENE II.,quality.
4828,SCENE II.,
4829,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ S'death, this would make a man sick."
4830,SCENE II.,
4831,SCENE II.,"_1st King._ If that design appears,"
4832,SCENE II.,"I'll lug them by the ears,"
4833,SCENE II.,Until I make 'em crack.
4834,SCENE II.,
4835,SCENE II.,"_2nd King._ And so will I, i'fack."
4836,SCENE II.,
4837,SCENE II.,"_1st King._ You must begin, _Ma foy_."
4838,SCENE II.,
4839,SCENE II.,"_2nd King._ Sweet sir, _Pardonnez moy_."
4840,SCENE II.,
4841,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Mark that; I make 'em both speak French, to show their breeding."
4842,SCENE II.,
4843,SCENE II.,"_Johns._ Oh, 'tis extraordinary fine!"
4844,SCENE II.,
4845,SCENE II.,"_2nd King._ Then spite of fate, we'll thus combined stand,"
4846,SCENE II.,"And, like two brothers, walk still hand in hand."
4847,SCENE II.,[_Exeunt Reges._
4848,SCENE II.,
4849,SCENE II.,_Johns._ This is a majestic scene indeed.
4850,SCENE II.,
4851,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Ay, 'tis a crust, a lasting crust for your rogue-critics, egad:"
4852,SCENE II.,I would fain see the proudest of 'em all but dare to nibble at this;
4853,SCENE II.,"egad, if they do, this shall rub their gums for 'em, I promise you. It"
4854,SCENE II.,"was I, you must know, that have written a whole play just in this very"
4855,SCENE II.,same style; it was never acted yet.
4856,SCENE II.,
4857,SCENE II.,_Johns._ How so?
4858,SCENE II.,
4859,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Egad, I can hardly tell you for laughing: ha, ha, ha! it is so"
4860,SCENE II.,"pleasant a story: ha, ha, ha!"
4861,SCENE II.,
4862,SCENE II.,_Smith._ What is't?
4863,SCENE II.,
4864,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Egad, the players refuse to act it. Ha, ha, ha!"
4865,SCENE II.,
4866,SCENE II.,_Smith._ That's impossible!
4867,SCENE II.,
4868,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Egad, they did it, sir; point-blank refus'd it, egad, ha, ha, ha!"
4869,SCENE II.,
4870,SCENE II.,"_Johns._ Fie, that was rude."
4871,SCENE II.,
4872,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Rude! ay, egad, they are the rudest, uncivillest persons, and"
4873,SCENE II.,"all that, in the whole world, egad. Egad, there's no living with 'em."
4874,SCENE II.,"I have written, Mr. Johnson, I do verily believe, a whole cartload of"
4875,SCENE II.,"things, every whit as good as this; and yet, I vow to gad, these insolent"
4876,SCENE II.,rascals have turn'd 'em all back upon my hands again.
4877,SCENE II.,
4878,SCENE II.,_Johns._ Strange fellows indeed!
4879,SCENE II.,
4880,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ But pray, Mr. Bayes, how came these two kings to know of this"
4881,SCENE II.,"whisper? for, as I remember, they were not present at it."
4882,SCENE II.,
4883,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ No, but that's the actors' fault, and not mine; for the two"
4884,SCENE II.,kings should (a plague take 'em) have popp'd both their heads in at the
4885,SCENE II.,"door, just as the other went off."
4886,SCENE II.,
4887,SCENE II.,_Smith._ That indeed would have done it.
4888,SCENE II.,
4889,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Done it! ay, egad, these fellows are able to spoil the best"
4890,SCENE II.,"things in Christendom. I'll tell you, Mr. Johnson, I vow to gad, I have"
4891,SCENE II.,"been so highly disoblig'd by the peremptoriness of these fellows, that"
4892,SCENE II.,I'm resolved hereafter to bend my thoughts wholly for the service of the
4893,SCENE II.,"nursery, and mump your proud players, egad. So, now Prince Prettyman"
4894,SCENE II.,"comes in, and falls asleep, making love to his mistress; which you know"
4895,SCENE II.,"was a grand intrigue in a late play, written by a very honest gentleman,"
4896,SCENE II.,a knight.[14]
4897,SCENE II.,
4898,SCENE II.,
4899,SCENE III.,SCENE III.
4900,SCENE III.,
4901,SCENE III.,_Enter_ PRINCE PRETTYMAN.
4902,SCENE III.,
4903,SCENE III.,_Pret._ How strange a captive am I grown of late!
4904,SCENE III.,"Shall I accuse my love, or blame my fate!"
4905,SCENE III.,"My love, I cannot; that is too divine:"
4906,SCENE III.,And against fate what mortal dares repine?[15]
4907,SCENE III.,
4908,SCENE III.,_Enter_ CHLORIS.
4909,SCENE III.,
4910,SCENE III.,But here she comes.
4911,SCENE III.,Sure 'tis some blazing comet! is it not!      [_Lies down._
4912,SCENE III.,
4913,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ Blazing comet! mark that, egad, very fine!"
4914,SCENE III.,
4915,SCENE III.,"_Pret._ But I am so surpris'd with sleep, I cannot speak the"
4916,SCENE III.,rest.                                            [_Sleeps._
4917,SCENE III.,
4918,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ Does not that, now, surprise you, to fall asleep in the nick?"
4919,SCENE III.,"his spirits exhale with the heat of his passion, and all that, and swop"
4920,SCENE III.,"he falls asleep, as you see. Now here she must make a simile."
4921,SCENE III.,
4922,SCENE III.,"_Smith._ Where's the necessity of that, Mr. Bayes?"
4923,SCENE III.,
4924,SCENE III.,_Bayes._ Because she's surpris'd. That's a general rule; you must ever
4925,SCENE III.,make a simile when you are surpris'd; 'tis the new way of writing.
4926,SCENE III.,
4927,SCENE III.,"_Cloris._[16] As some tall pine, which we on Ætna find"
4928,SCENE III.,"T' have stood the rage of many a boist'rous wind,"
4929,SCENE III.,"Feeling without that flames within do play,"
4930,SCENE III.,Which would consume his root and sap away;
4931,SCENE III.,"He spreads his worsted arms unto the skies,"
4932,SCENE III.,"Silently grieves, all pale, repines and dies:"
4933,SCENE III.,"So shrouded up, your bright eye disappears."
4934,SCENE III.,"Break forth, bright scorching sun, and dry my tears."
4935,SCENE III.,[_Exit._
4936,SCENE III.,
4937,SCENE III.,"_Johns._ Mr. Bayes, methinks this simile wants a little application too."
4938,SCENE III.,
4939,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ No, faith; for it alludes to passion, to consuming, to dying,"
4940,SCENE III.,"and all that; which, you know, are the natural effects of an amour. But"
4941,SCENE III.,"I'm afraid this scene has made you sad; for, I must confess, when I writ"
4942,SCENE III.,"it, I wept myself."
4943,SCENE III.,
4944,SCENE III.,"_Smith._ No truly, sir, my spirits are almost exhal'd too, and I am"
4945,SCENE III.,likelier to fall asleep.
4946,SCENE III.,
4947,SCENE III.,"PRINCE PRETTYMAN _starts up, and says_--"
4948,SCENE III.,
4949,SCENE III.,_Pret._ It is resolved!                            [_Exit._
4950,SCENE III.,
4951,SCENE III.,_Bayes._ That's all.
4952,SCENE III.,
4953,SCENE III.,"_Smith._ Mr. Bayes, may one be so bold as to ask you one question, now,"
4954,SCENE III.,and you not be angry?
4955,SCENE III.,
4956,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ O Lord, sir, you may ask me anything; what you please; I vow to"
4957,SCENE III.,"gad, you do me a great deal of honour: you do not know me, if you say"
4958,SCENE III.,"that, sir."
4959,SCENE III.,
4960,SCENE III.,"_Smith._ Then pray, sir, what is it that this prince here has resolved in"
4961,SCENE III.,his sleep?
4962,SCENE III.,
4963,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ Why, I must confess, that question is well enough asked, for one"
4964,SCENE III.,"that is not acquainted with this new way of writing. But you must know,"
4965,SCENE III.,"sir, that to outdo all my fellow-writers, whereas they keep their intrigo"
4966,SCENE III.,"secret, till the very last scene before the dance; I now, sir (do you"
4967,SCENE III.,mark me?)--a--
4968,SCENE III.,
4969,SCENE III.,"_Smith._ Begin the play, and end it, without ever opening the plot at all?"
4970,SCENE III.,
4971,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ I do so, that's the very plain truth on't: ha, ha, ha! I do,"
4972,SCENE III.,"egad. If they cannot find it out themselves, e'en let 'em alone for"
4973,SCENE III.,"Bayes, I warrant you. But here, now, is a scene of business: pray observe"
4974,SCENE III.,"it; for I dare say you'll think it no unwise discourse this, nor ill"
4975,SCENE III.,"argued. To tell you true, 'tis a discourse I overheard once betwixt two"
4976,SCENE III.,"grand, sober, governing persons."
4977,SCENE III.,
4978,SCENE III.,
4979,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.
4980,SCENE IV.,
4981,SCENE IV.,_Enter_ GENTLEMAN-USHER _and_ PHYSICIAN.
4982,SCENE IV.,
4983,SCENE IV.,"_Ush._ Come, sir; let's state the matter of fact, and lay our heads"
4984,SCENE IV.,together.
4985,SCENE IV.,
4986,SCENE IV.,_Phys._ Right; lay our heads together. I love to be merry sometimes; but
4987,SCENE IV.,"when a knotty point comes, I lay my head close to it, with a snuff-box in"
4988,SCENE IV.,"my hand; and then I fegue it away, i'faith."
4989,SCENE IV.,
4990,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ I do just so, egad, always."
4991,SCENE IV.,
4992,SCENE IV.,"_Ush._ The grand question is, whether they heard us whisper? which I"
4993,SCENE IV.,divide thus.
4994,SCENE IV.,
4995,SCENE IV.,"_Phys._ Yes, it must be divided so indeed."
4996,SCENE IV.,
4997,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ That's very complaisant, I swear, Mr. Bayes, to be of another"
4998,SCENE IV.,"man's opinion, before he knows what it is."
4999,SCENE IV.,
5000,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Nay, I bring in none here but well-bred persons, I assure you."
5001,SCENE IV.,
5002,SCENE IV.,"_Ush._ I divide the question into when they heard, what they heard, and"
5003,SCENE IV.,whether they heard or no.
5004,SCENE IV.,
5005,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ Most admirably divided, I swear!"
5006,SCENE IV.,
5007,SCENE IV.,"_Ush._ As to the when; you say, just now: so that is answer'd. Then, as"
5008,SCENE IV.,"for what; why, that answers itself; for what could they hear, but what"
5009,SCENE IV.,"we talk'd of? so that, naturally, and of necessity, we come to the last"
5010,SCENE IV.,"question, _videlicet_, whether they heard or no."
5011,SCENE IV.,
5012,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ This is a very wise scene, Mr. Bayes."
5013,SCENE IV.,
5014,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Ay, you have it right; they are both politicians."
5015,SCENE IV.,
5016,SCENE IV.,"_Ush._ Pray, then, to proceed in method, let me ask you that question."
5017,SCENE IV.,
5018,SCENE IV.,"_Phys._ No, you'll answer better; pray let me ask it you."
5019,SCENE IV.,
5020,SCENE IV.,_Ush._ Your will must be a law.
5021,SCENE IV.,
5022,SCENE IV.,"_Phys._ Come, then, what is't I must ask?"
5023,SCENE IV.,
5024,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ This politician, I perceive, Mr. Bayes, has somewhat a short"
5025,SCENE IV.,memory.
5026,SCENE IV.,
5027,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, you must know, that t'other is the main politician,"
5028,SCENE IV.,and this is but his pupil.
5029,SCENE IV.,
5030,SCENE IV.,_Ush._ You must ask me whether they heard us whisper.
5031,SCENE IV.,
5032,SCENE IV.,"_Phys._ Well, I do so."
5033,SCENE IV.,
5034,SCENE IV.,_Ush._ Say it then.
5035,SCENE IV.,
5036,SCENE IV.,_Smith._ Heyday! here's the bravest work that ever I saw.
5037,SCENE IV.,
5038,SCENE IV.,_Johns._ This is mighty methodical.
5039,SCENE IV.,
5040,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Ay, sir; that's the way; 'tis the way of art; there is no other"
5041,SCENE IV.,"way, egad, in business."
5042,SCENE IV.,
5043,SCENE IV.,_Phys._ Did they hear us whisper?
5044,SCENE IV.,
5045,SCENE IV.,"_Ush._ Why, truly, I can't tell; there's much to be said upon the word"
5046,SCENE IV.,"whisper: to whisper in Latin is _susurrare_, which is as much as to"
5047,SCENE IV.,"say, to speak softly; now, if they heard us speak softly, they heard us"
5048,SCENE IV.,"whisper; but then comes in the _quomodo_, the _how_; how did they hear"
5049,SCENE IV.,"us whisper? why as to that, there are two ways: the one, by chance or"
5050,SCENE IV.,"accident; the other, on purpose; that is, with design to hear us whisper."
5051,SCENE IV.,
5052,SCENE IV.,"_Phys._ Nay, if they heard us that way, I'll never give them physic more."
5053,SCENE IV.,
5054,SCENE IV.,_Ush._ Nor I e'er more will walk abroad before 'em.
5055,SCENE IV.,
5056,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Pray mark this, for a great deal depends upon it, towards the"
5057,SCENE IV.,latter end of the play.
5058,SCENE IV.,
5059,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ I suppose that's the reason why you brought in this scene, Mr."
5060,SCENE IV.,Bayes.
5061,SCENE IV.,
5062,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Partly, it was, sir; but I confess I was not unwilling, besides,"
5063,SCENE IV.,"to show the world a pattern, here, how men should talk of business."
5064,SCENE IV.,
5065,SCENE IV.,_Johns._ You have done it exceeding well indeed.
5066,SCENE IV.,
5067,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Yes, I think this will do."
5068,SCENE IV.,
5069,SCENE IV.,"_Phys._ Well, if they heard us whisper, they will turn us out, and nobody"
5070,SCENE IV.,else will take us.
5071,SCENE IV.,
5072,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Not for politicians, I dare answer for it."
5073,SCENE IV.,
5074,SCENE IV.,_Phys._ Let's then no more ourselves in vain bemoan:
5075,SCENE IV.,We are not safe until we them unthrone.
5076,SCENE IV.,
5077,SCENE IV.,_Ush._ 'Tis right:
5078,SCENE IV.,"And, since occasion now seems debonair,"
5079,SCENE IV.,"I'll seize on this, and you shall take that chair."
5080,SCENE IV.,
5081,SCENE IV.,"[_They draw their swords, and sit in the two great chairs upon the stage._"
5082,SCENE IV.,
5083,SCENE IV.,_Bayes._ There's now an odd surprise; the whole state's turned quite
5084,SCENE IV.,"topsy-turvy, without any pother or stir in the whole world, egad.[17]"
5085,SCENE IV.,
5086,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ A very silent change of government, truly, as ever I heard of."
5087,SCENE IV.,
5088,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ It is so. And yet you shall see me bring 'em in again,"
5089,SCENE IV.,"by-and-by, in as odd a way every jot."
5090,SCENE IV.,
5091,SCENE IV.,"[_The Usurpers march out, flourishing their swords._"
5092,SCENE IV.,
5093,SCENE IV.,_Enter_ SHIRLY.
5094,SCENE IV.,
5095,SCENE IV.,"_Shir._ Heyho! heyho! what a change is here! heyday, heyday!"
5096,SCENE IV.,"I know not what to do, nor what to say.[18]        [_Exit._"
5097,SCENE IV.,
5098,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ Mr. Bayes, in my opinion, now, that gentleman might have said"
5099,SCENE IV.,a little more upon this occasion.
5100,SCENE IV.,
5101,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ No, sir, not at all; for I underwrit his part on purpose to set"
5102,SCENE IV.,off the rest.
5103,SCENE IV.,
5104,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ Cry you mercy, sir."
5105,SCENE IV.,
5106,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ But pray, sir, how came they to depose the kings so easily?"
5107,SCENE IV.,
5108,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, you must know, they long had a design to do it before;"
5109,SCENE IV.,"but never could put it in practice till now: and to tell you true, that's"
5110,SCENE IV.,one reason why I made 'em whisper so at first.
5111,SCENE IV.,
5112,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Oh, very well; now I'm fully satisfied."
5113,SCENE IV.,
5114,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ And then to show you, sir, it was not done so very easily"
5115,SCENE IV.,"neither, in the next scene you shall see some fighting."
5116,SCENE IV.,
5117,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Oh, oh; so then you make the struggle to be after the business"
5118,SCENE IV.,is done?
5119,SCENE IV.,
5120,SCENE IV.,_Bayes._ Ay.
5121,SCENE IV.,
5122,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Oh, I conceive you: that, I swear, is very natural."
5123,SCENE IV.,

5126,SCENE V.,
5127,SCENE V.,"_Enter four Men at one door, and four at another, with their swords"
5128,SCENE V.,drawn._
5129,SCENE V.,
5130,SCENE V.,_1st Sold._ Stand. Who goes there?
5131,SCENE V.,
5132,SCENE V.,_2nd Sold._ A friend.
5133,SCENE V.,
5134,SCENE V.,_1st Sold._ What friend?
5135,SCENE V.,
5136,SCENE V.,_2nd Sold._ A friend to the house.
5137,SCENE V.,
5138,SCENE V.,_1st Sold._ Fall on!          [_They all kill one another._
5139,SCENE V.,[_Music strikes._
5140,SCENE V.,
5141,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Hold, hold.            [_To the music. It ceases._"
5142,SCENE V.,"Now, here's an odd surprise: all these dead men you shall see"
5143,SCENE V.,"rise up presently, at a certain note that I have, in _effaut flat_,"
5144,SCENE V.,"and fall a-dancing. Do you hear, dead men? remember your"
5145,SCENE V.,note in _effaut flat_.
5146,SCENE V.,Play on.                                   [_To the music._
5147,SCENE V.,"Now, now, now!    [_The music plays his note, and the dead men"
5148,SCENE V.,rise; but cannot get in order._
5149,SCENE V.,"O Lord! O Lord! Out, out, out! did ever men spoil a good"
5150,SCENE V.,"thing so! no figure, no ear, no time, nothing. Udzookers, you"
5151,SCENE V.,"dance worse than the angels in ""Harry the Eighth,"" or the fat"
5152,SCENE V.,"spirits in the ""Tempest,"" egad."
5153,SCENE V.,
5154,SCENE V.,"_1st Sold._ Why, sir, 'tis impossible to do anything in time, to this"
5155,SCENE V.,tune.
5156,SCENE V.,
5157,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ O Lord, O Lord! impossible! Why, gentlemen, if there be any"
5158,SCENE V.,"faith in a person that's a Christian, I sat up two whole nights in"
5159,SCENE V.,"composing this air, and apting it for the business; for, if you observe,"
5160,SCENE V.,"there are two several designs in this tune: it begins swift, and ends"
5161,SCENE V.,"slow. You talk of time, and time; you shall see me do it. Look you, now:"
5162,SCENE V.,here I am dead.
5163,SCENE V.,
5164,SCENE V.,[_Lies down flat upon his face._
5165,SCENE V.,
5166,SCENE V.,"Now mark my note _effaut flat_. Strike up, music."
5167,SCENE V.,"Now.        [_As he rises up hastily, he falls down again._"
5168,SCENE V.,"Ah, gadzookers! I have broke my nose."
5169,SCENE V.,
5170,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ By my troth, Mr. Bayes, this is a very unfortunate note of"
5171,SCENE V.,"yours, in _effaut_."
5172,SCENE V.,
5173,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ A plague on this old stage, with your nails, and your"
5174,SCENE V.,"tenter-hooks, that a gentleman can't come to teach you to act, but he"
5175,SCENE V.,"must break his nose, and his face, and the devil and all. Pray, sir, can"
5176,SCENE V.,you help me to a wet piece of brown paper?
5177,SCENE V.,
5178,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ No, indeed, sir, I don't usually carry any about me."
5179,SCENE V.,
5180,SCENE V.,"_2nd Sold._ Sir, I'll go get you some within presently."
5181,SCENE V.,
5182,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Go, go, then; I follow you. Pray dance out the dance, and I'll"
5183,SCENE V.,be with you in a moment. Remember you dance like horse-men.
5184,SCENE V.,
5185,SCENE V.,[_Exit_ BAYES.
5186,SCENE V.,
5187,SCENE V.,_Smith._ Like horse-men! what a plague can that be?
5188,SCENE V.,
5189,SCENE V.,"_They dance the dance, but can make nothing of it._"
5190,SCENE V.,
5191,SCENE V.,_1st Sold._ A devil! let's try this no longer. Play my dance
5192,SCENE V.,"that Mr. Bayes found fault with so.   [_Dance, and Exeunt._"
5193,SCENE V.,
5194,SCENE V.,_Smith._ What can this fool be doing all this while about his
5195,SCENE V.,nose?

5208,ACT III.--SCENE I.,every act with a dance.
5209,ACT III.--SCENE I.,
5210,ACT III.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Faith, that fancy is very good; but I should hardly have broke"

5244,ACT III.--SCENE I.,

5248,ACT III.--SCENE I.,"I cut out, I shan't want journeymen enow to help me, I warrant you."
5249,ACT III.--SCENE I.,

5253,ACT III.--SCENE I.,

5255,ACT III.--SCENE I.,
5256,ACT III.--SCENE I.,"_Thim._ However, if my wife sits but as I do, there will be no"
5257,ACT III.--SCENE I.,"great danger: not half so much as when I trusted you, sir, for your"
5258,ACT III.--SCENE I.,coronation-suit.

5260,ACT III.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Very good, i'faith."
5261,ACT III.--SCENE I.,
5262,ACT III.--SCENE I.,_Pret._ Why the times then liv'd upon trust; it was the fashion. You
5263,ACT III.--SCENE I.,"would not be out of time, at such a time as that, sure: a tailor, you"

5381,SONG.[23],"amongst us that have it. I know you have wit, by the judgment you make"
5382,SONG.[23],of this play; for that's the measure we go by: my play is my touchstone.
5383,SONG.[23],When a man tells me such a one is a person of parts: is he so? say I;

5390,SCENE II.,SCENE II.
5391,SCENE II.,
5392,SCENE II.,"_Enter the two_ USURPERS,[25] _hand in hand_."
5393,SCENE II.,
5394,SCENE II.,_Ush._ But what's become of Volscius the Great;
5395,SCENE II.,His presence has not grac'd our court of late.
5396,SCENE II.,
5397,SCENE II.,"_Phys._ I fear some ill, from emulation sprung,"
5398,SCENE II.,Has from us that illustrious hero wrung.
5399,SCENE II.,
5400,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ Is not that majestical?
5401,SCENE II.,
5402,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Yes, but who the devil is that Volscius?"
5403,SCENE II.,
5404,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Why, that's a prince I make in love with Parthenope."
5405,SCENE II.,
5406,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ I thank you, sir."
5407,SCENE II.,
5408,SCENE II.,_Enter_ CORDELIO.
5409,SCENE II.,
5410,SCENE II.,"_Cor._ My lieges, news from Volscius the prince."
5411,SCENE II.,
5412,SCENE II.,"_Ush._ His news is welcome, whatsoe'er it be.[26]"
5413,SCENE II.,
5414,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ How, sir, do you mean whether it be good or bad?"
5415,SCENE II.,
5416,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Nay, pray, sir, have a little patience: gadzookers, you'll"
5417,SCENE II.,"spoil all my play. Why, sir, 'tis impossible to answer every impertinent"
5418,SCENE II.,question you ask.
5419,SCENE II.,
5420,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Cry you mercy, sir."
5421,SCENE II.,
5422,SCENE II.,"_Cor._ His highness, sirs, commanded me to tell you,"
5423,SCENE II.,"That the fair person whom you both do know,"
5424,SCENE II.,"Despairing of forgiveness for her fault,"
5425,SCENE II.,"In a deep sorrow, twice she did attempt"
5426,SCENE II.,"Upon her precious life; but, by the care"
5427,SCENE II.,"Of standers-by, prevented was."
5428,SCENE II.,
5429,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Why, what stuff's here?"
5430,SCENE II.,
5431,SCENE II.,"_Cor._ At last,"
5432,SCENE II.,Volscius the Great this dire resolve embrac'd:
5433,SCENE II.,"His servants he into the country sent,"
5434,SCENE II.,And he himself to Piccadilly went;
5435,SCENE II.,Where he's inform'd by letters that she's dead.
5436,SCENE II.,
5437,SCENE II.,_Ush._ Dead! is that possible? dead!
5438,SCENE II.,
5439,SCENE II.,_Phys._ O ye gods!                               [_Exeunt._
5440,SCENE II.,
5441,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ There's a smart expression of a passion: O ye gods! that's one
5442,SCENE II.,"of my bold strokes, egad."
5443,SCENE II.,
5444,SCENE II.,_Smith._ Yes; but who's the fair person that's dead?
5445,SCENE II.,
5446,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ That you shall know anon, sir."
5447,SCENE II.,
5448,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Nay, if we know at all, 'tis well enough."
5449,SCENE II.,
5450,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Perhaps you may find, too, by-and-by, for all this, that she's"
5451,SCENE II.,not dead neither.
5452,SCENE II.,
5453,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Marry, that's good news indeed. I am glad of that with all my"
5454,SCENE II.,heart.
5455,SCENE II.,
5456,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ Now here's the man brought in that is supposed to have kill'd
5457,SCENE II.,her. [_A great shout within._
5458,SCENE II.,
5459,SCENE II.,
5460,SCENE III.,SCENE III.
5461,SCENE III.,
5462,SCENE III.,"_Enter_ AMARYLLIS, _with a book in her hand, and attendants._"
5463,SCENE III.,
5464,SCENE III.,_Ama._ What shout triumphant's that?
5465,SCENE III.,
5466,SCENE III.,_Enter a_ SOLDIER.
5467,SCENE III.,
5468,SCENE III.,"_Sold._ Shy maid, upon the river brink, near Twic'nam town, the false"
5469,SCENE III.,assassinate is ta'en.
5470,SCENE III.,
5471,SCENE III.,"_Ama._ Thanks to the powers above for this deliverance. I hope,"
5472,SCENE III.,
5473,SCENE III.,Its slow beginning will portend
5474,SCENE III.,A forward exit to all future end.
5475,SCENE III.,
5476,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ Pish! there you are out; to all future end! no, no; to all"
5477,SCENE III.,"future END! You must lay the accent upon ""end,"" or else you lose the"
5478,SCENE III.,conceit.
5479,SCENE III.,
5480,SCENE III.,_Smith._ I see you are very perfect in these matters.
5481,SCENE III.,
5482,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ Ay, sir, I have been long enough at it, one would think, to know"
5483,SCENE III.,something.
5484,SCENE III.,
5485,SCENE III.,"_Enter_ SOLDIERS, _dragging in an old_ FISHERMAN."
5486,SCENE III.,
5487,SCENE III.,"_Ama._ Villain, what monster did corrupt thy mind"
5488,SCENE III.,T' attack the noblest soul of human kind?
5489,SCENE III.,
5490,SCENE III.,Tell me who set thee on.
5491,SCENE III.,
5492,SCENE III.,_Fish._ Prince Prettyman.
5493,SCENE III.,
5494,SCENE III.,_Ama._ To kill whom?
5495,SCENE III.,
5496,SCENE III.,_Fish._ Prince Prettyman.
5497,SCENE III.,
5498,SCENE III.,_Ama._ What! did Prince Prettyman hire you to kill Prince Prettyman?
5499,SCENE III.,
5500,SCENE III.,_Fish._ No; Prince Volscius.
5501,SCENE III.,
5502,SCENE III.,_Ama._ To kill whom?
5503,SCENE III.,
5504,SCENE III.,_Fish._ Prince Volscius.
5505,SCENE III.,
5506,SCENE III.,_Ama._ What! did Prince Volscius hire you to kill Prince Volscius?
5507,SCENE III.,
5508,SCENE III.,"_Fish._ No, Prince Prettyman."
5509,SCENE III.,
5510,SCENE III.,"_Ama._ So drag him hence,"
5511,SCENE III.,Till torture of the rack produce his sense.      [_Exeunt._
5512,SCENE III.,
5513,SCENE III.,_Bayes._ Mark how I make the horror of his guilt confound his intellects;
5514,SCENE III.,for he's out at one and t'other: and that's the design of this scene.
5515,SCENE III.,
5516,SCENE III.,"_Smith._ I see, sir, you have a several design for every scene."
5517,SCENE III.,
5518,SCENE III.,"_Bayes._ Ay, that's my way of writing; and so, sir, I can dispatch you a"
5519,SCENE III.,"whole play, before another man, egad, can make an end of his plot."
5520,SCENE III.,
5521,SCENE III.,
5522,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.
5523,SCENE IV.,
5524,SCENE IV.,"So now enter Prince Prettyman in a rage. Where the devil is he? why,"
5525,SCENE IV.,"Prettyman? why, where I say? O fie, fie, fie, fie! all's marr'd, I vow to"
5526,SCENE IV.,"gad, quite marr'd."
5527,SCENE IV.,
5528,SCENE IV.,_Enter_ PRETTYMAN.
5529,SCENE IV.,
5530,SCENE IV.,"Phoo, phoo! you are come too late, sir; now you may go out again, if you"
5531,SCENE IV.,"please. I vow to gad, Mr.--a--I would not give a button for my play, now"
5532,SCENE IV.,you have done this.
5533,SCENE IV.,
5534,SCENE IV.,"_Pret._ What, sir?"
5535,SCENE IV.,
5536,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ What, sir! why, sir, you should have come out in choler, rouse"
5537,SCENE IV.,"upon the stage, just as the other went off. Must a man be eternally"
5538,SCENE IV.,telling you of these things?
5539,SCENE IV.,
5540,SCENE IV.,_Johns._ Sure this must be some very notable matter that he's so angry at.
5541,SCENE IV.,
5542,SCENE IV.,_Smith._ I am not of your opinion.
5543,SCENE IV.,
5544,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Pish! come let's hear your part, sir."
5545,SCENE IV.,
5546,SCENE IV.,_Pret._[27]Bring in my father: why d'ye keep him from me?
5547,SCENE IV.,"Altho' a fisherman, he is my father:"
5548,SCENE IV.,"Was ever son yet brought to this distress,"
5549,SCENE IV.,"To be, for being a son, made fatherless!"
5550,SCENE IV.,"Ah! you just gods, rob me not of a father:"
5551,SCENE IV.,The being of a son take from me rather.            [_Exit._
5552,SCENE IV.,
5553,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Well, Ned, what think you now?"
5554,SCENE IV.,
5555,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ A devil, this is worst of all: Mr. Bayes, pray what's the"
5556,SCENE IV.,meaning of this scene?
5557,SCENE IV.,
5558,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ O cry you mercy, sir: I protest I had forgot to tell you. Why,"
5559,SCENE IV.,"sir, you must know, that long before the beginning of this play, this"
5560,SCENE IV.,prince was taken by a fisherman.
5561,SCENE IV.,
5562,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ How, sir, taken prisoner?"
5563,SCENE IV.,
5564,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Taken prisoner! O Lord, what a question's there! did ever any"
5565,SCENE IV.,"man ask such a questions? Plague on him, he has put the plot quite out of"
5566,SCENE IV.,my head with this--this--question! what was I going to say?
5567,SCENE IV.,
5568,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ Nay, Heaven knows: I cannot imagine."
5569,SCENE IV.,
5570,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Stay, let me see: taken! O 'tis true. Why, sir, as I was going"
5571,SCENE IV.,"to say, his highness here, the prince, was taken in a cradle by a"
5572,SCENE IV.,"fisherman, and brought up as his child!"
5573,SCENE IV.,
5574,SCENE IV.,_Smith._ Indeed!
5575,SCENE IV.,
5576,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Nay, prithee, hold thy peace. And so, sir, this murder being"
5577,SCENE IV.,"committed by the river-side, the fisherman, upon suspicion, was seiz'd,"
5578,SCENE IV.,and thereupon the prince grew angry.
5579,SCENE IV.,
5580,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ So, so; now 'tis very plain."
5581,SCENE IV.,
5582,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ But, Mr. Bayes, is not this some disparagement to a prince, to"
5583,SCENE IV.,"pass for a fisherman's son? Have a care of that, I pray."
5584,SCENE IV.,
5585,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ No, no, not at all; for 'tis but for a while: I shall fetch him"
5586,SCENE IV.,"off again presently, you shall see."
5587,SCENE IV.,
5588,SCENE IV.,_Enter_ PRETTYMAN _and_ THIMBLE.
5589,SCENE IV.,
5590,SCENE IV.,"_Pret._ By all the gods, I'll set the world on fire,"
5591,SCENE IV.,Rather than let 'em ravish hence my sire.
5592,SCENE IV.,
5593,SCENE IV.,"_Thim._ Brave Prettyman, it is at length reveal'd,"
5594,SCENE IV.,That he is not thy sire who thee conceal'd.
5595,SCENE IV.,
5596,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Lo, you now; there, he's off again."
5597,SCENE IV.,
5598,SCENE IV.,"_Johns._ Admirably done, i'faith!"
5599,SCENE IV.,
5600,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Ay, now the plot thickens very much upon us."
5601,SCENE IV.,
5602,SCENE IV.,_Pret._ What oracle this darkness can evince!
5603,SCENE IV.,"Sometimes a fisher's son, sometimes a prince."
5604,SCENE IV.,"It is a secret, great as is the world;"
5605,SCENE IV.,"In which I, like the soul, am toss'd and hurl'd,"
5606,SCENE IV.,"The blackest ink of Fate sure was my lot,"
5607,SCENE IV.,"And when she writ my name, she made a blot.        [_Exit._"
5608,SCENE IV.,
5609,SCENE IV.,_Bayes._ There's a blustering verse for you now.
5610,SCENE IV.,
5611,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Yes, sir; but why is he so mightily troubled to find he is not"
5612,SCENE IV.,a fisherman's son?
5613,SCENE IV.,
5614,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ Phoo! that is not because he has a mind to be his son, but for"
5615,SCENE IV.,fear he should be thought to be nobody's son at all.
5616,SCENE IV.,
5617,SCENE IV.,"_Smith._ Nay, that would trouble a man, indeed."
5618,SCENE IV.,
5619,SCENE IV.,"_Bayes._ So, let me see."
5620,SCENE IV.,
5621,SCENE IV.,
5622,SCENE V.,SCENE V.
5623,SCENE V.,
5624,SCENE V.,"_Enter_ PRINCE VOLSCIUS, _going out of town._"
5625,SCENE V.,
5626,SCENE V.,_Smith._ I thought he had been gone to Piccadilly.
5627,SCENE V.,
5628,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Yes, he gave it out so; but that was only to cover his design."
5629,SCENE V.,
5630,SCENE V.,_Johns._ What design?
5631,SCENE V.,
5632,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Why, to head the army that lies conceal'd for him at"
5633,SCENE V.,Knightsbridge.
5634,SCENE V.,
5635,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ I see here's a great deal of plot, Mr. Bayes."
5636,SCENE V.,
5637,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Yes, now it begins to break: but we shall have a world of more"
5638,SCENE V.,business anon.
5639,SCENE V.,
5640,SCENE V.,"_Enter_ PRINCE VOLSCIUS, CLORIS, AMARYLLIS, _and_ HARRY, _with a"
5641,SCENE V.,riding-cloak and boots._
5642,SCENE V.,
5643,SCENE V.,"_Ama._ Sir, you are cruel thus to leave the town,"
5644,SCENE V.,And to retire to country solitude.
5645,SCENE V.,
5646,SCENE V.,_Clo._ We hop'd this summer that we should at least
5647,SCENE V.,Have held the honour of your company.
5648,SCENE V.,
5649,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ Held the honour of your company; prettily express'd: held the
5650,SCENE V.,"honour of your company! gadzookers, these fellows will never take notice"
5651,SCENE V.,of anything.
5652,SCENE V.,
5653,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ I assure you, sir, I admire it extremely; I don't know what he"
5654,SCENE V.,does.
5655,SCENE V.,
5656,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Ay, ay, he's a little envious; but 'tis no great matter. Come."
5657,SCENE V.,
5658,SCENE V.,_Ama._ Pray let us two this single boon obtain!
5659,SCENE V.,"That you will here, with poor us, still remain!"
5660,SCENE V.,"Before your horses come, pronounce our fate,"
5661,SCENE V.,"For then, alas, I fear 'twill be too late."
5662,SCENE V.,
5663,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ Sad!
5664,SCENE V.,"Harry, my boots; for I'll go range among!"
5665,SCENE V.,
5666,SCENE V.,"_Vols._ My blades encamp'd, and quit this urban throng.[28]"
5667,SCENE V.,
5668,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ But pray, Mr. Bayes, is not this a little difficult, that you"
5669,SCENE V.,"were saying e'en now, to keep an army thus conceal'd in Knightsbridge?"
5670,SCENE V.,
5671,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ In Knightsbridge? stay.
5672,SCENE V.,
5673,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ No, not if the inn-keepers be his friends."
5674,SCENE V.,
5675,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ His friends! ay, sir, his intimate acquaintance; or else indeed"
5676,SCENE V.,I grant it could not be.
5677,SCENE V.,
5678,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Yes, faith, so it might be very easy."
5679,SCENE V.,
5680,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Nay, if I do not make all things easy, egad, I'll give you leave"
5681,SCENE V.,to hang me. Now you would think that he's going out of town: but you
5682,SCENE V.,shall see how prettily I have contriv'd to stop him presently.
5683,SCENE V.,
5684,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ By my troth, sir, you have so amaz'd me, that I know not what to"
5685,SCENE V.,think.
5686,SCENE V.,
5687,SCENE V.,_Enter_ PARTHENOPE.
5688,SCENE V.,
5689,SCENE V.,_Vols._ Bless me! how frail are all my best resolves!
5690,SCENE V.,"How, in a moment, is my purpose chang'd!"
5691,SCENE V.,Too soon I thought myself secure from love.
5692,SCENE V.,"Fair madam, give me leave to ask her name,[29]"
5693,SCENE V.,Who does so gently rob me of my fame:
5694,SCENE V.,"For I should meet the army out of town,"
5695,SCENE V.,"And if I fail, must hazard my renown."
5696,SCENE V.,
5697,SCENE V.,"_Par._ My mother, sir, sells ale by the town-walls;"
5698,SCENE V.,And me her dear Parthenope she calls.
5699,SCENE V.,
5700,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ Now that's the Parthenope I told you of.
5701,SCENE V.,
5702,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ Ay, ay, egad, you are very right."
5703,SCENE V.,
5704,SCENE V.,_Vols._ Can vulgar vestments high-born beauty shroud?
5705,SCENE V.,Thou bring'st the morning pictur'd in a cloud.[30]
5706,SCENE V.,
5707,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ The morning pictur'd in a cloud! ah, gadzookers, what a conceit"
5708,SCENE V.,is there!
5709,SCENE V.,
5710,SCENE V.,"_Par._ Give you good even, sir. [_Exit._"
5711,SCENE V.,
5712,SCENE V.,"_Vols._ O inauspicious stars! that I was born To sudden love, and to more"
5713,SCENE V.,sudden scorn!
5714,SCENE V.,
5715,SCENE V.,"_Ama._ } How! Prince Volscius in love? ha, ha, ha![31] _Clo._ } [_Exeunt"
5716,SCENE V.,laughing._
5717,SCENE V.,
5718,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Sure, Mr. Bayes, we have lost some jest here, that they laugh at"
5719,SCENE V.,so.
5720,SCENE V.,
5721,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Why, did you not observe? he first resolves to go out of town,"
5722,SCENE V.,"and then as he's pulling on his boots, falls in love with her; ha, ha, ha!"
5723,SCENE V.,
5724,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Well, and where lies the jest of that?"
5725,SCENE V.,
5726,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ Ha? [_Turns to_ JOHNS.
5727,SCENE V.,
5728,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ Why, in the boots: where should the jest lie?"
5729,SCENE V.,
5730,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Egad, you are in the right: it does lie in the boots----"
5731,SCENE V.,[_Turns to_ SMITH.
5732,SCENE V.,"Your friend and I know where a good jest lies, though you don't, sir."
5733,SCENE V.,
5734,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Much good do't you, sir."
5735,SCENE V.,
5736,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Here now, Mr. Johnson, you shall see a combat betwixt love and"
5737,SCENE V.,honour. An ancient author has made a whole play on't;[32] but I have
5738,SCENE V.,dispatch'd it all in this scene.
5739,SCENE V.,
5740,SCENE V.,"VOLSCIUS _sits down to pull on his boots:_ BAYES _stands by, and"
5741,SCENE V.,over-acts the part as he speaks it._
5742,SCENE V.,
5743,SCENE V.,_Vols._ How has my passion made me Cupid's scoff!
5744,SCENE V.,"This hasty boot is on, the other off,"
5745,SCENE V.,"And sullen lies, with amorous design,"
5746,SCENE V.,"To quit loud fame, and make that beauty mine."
5747,SCENE V.,
5748,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Prithee, mark what pains Mr. Bayes takes to act this speech"
5749,SCENE V.,himself!
5750,SCENE V.,
5751,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ Yes, the fool, I see, is mightily transported with it."
5752,SCENE V.,
5753,SCENE V.,_Vols._ My legs the emblem of my various thought
5754,SCENE V.,Show to what sad distraction I am brought.
5755,SCENE V.,"Sometimes with stubborn honour, like this boot,"
5756,SCENE V.,"My mind is guarded, and resolv'd to do't:"
5757,SCENE V.,"Sometimes again, that very mind, by love"
5758,SCENE V.,"Disarméd, like this other leg does prove."
5759,SCENE V.,Shall I to honour or to love give way?
5760,SCENE V.,"Go on, cries honour;[33] tender love says, nay;"
5761,SCENE V.,"Honour aloud commands, pluck both boots on;"
5762,SCENE V.,"But softer love does whisper, put on none."
5763,SCENE V.,"What shall I do! what conduct shall I find,"
5764,SCENE V.,To lead me thro' this twilight of my mind?
5765,SCENE V.,"For as bright day, with black approach of night"
5766,SCENE V.,"Contending, makes a doubtful puzzling light;"
5767,SCENE V.,So does my honour and my love together
5768,SCENE V.,"Puzzle me so, I can resolve for neither."
5769,SCENE V.,"[_Goes out hopping, with one boot on, and t'other off._"
5770,SCENE V.,
5771,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ By my troth, sir, this is as difficult a combat as ever I saw,"
5772,SCENE V.,and as equal; for 'tis determin'd on neither side.
5773,SCENE V.,
5774,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Ay, is't not now egad, ha? for to go off hip-hop, hip-hop, upon"
5775,SCENE V.,"this occasion, is a thousand times better than any conclusion in the"
5776,SCENE V.,"world, egad."
5777,SCENE V.,
5778,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ Indeed, Mr. Bayes, that hip-hop, in this place, as you say, does"
5779,SCENE V.,a very great deal.
5780,SCENE V.,
5781,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Oh, all in all, sir! they are these little things that mar,"
5782,SCENE V.,"or set you off a play; as I remember once in a play of mine, I set"
5783,SCENE V.,"off a scene, egad, beyond expectation, only with a petticoat, and the"
5784,SCENE V.,gripes.[34]
5785,SCENE V.,
5786,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Pray how was that, sir?"
5787,SCENE V.,
5788,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, I contriv'd a petticoat to be brought in upon a chair"
5789,SCENE V.,"(nobody knew how) into a prince's chamber, whose father was not to see"
5790,SCENE V.,"it, that came in by chance."
5791,SCENE V.,
5792,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ By-my-life, that was a notable contrivance indeed."
5793,SCENE V.,
5794,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Ay, but Mr. Bayes, how could you contrive the stomach-ache?"
5795,SCENE V.,
5796,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ The easiest i' th' world, egad: I'll tell you how. I made the"
5797,SCENE V.,"prince sit down upon the petticoat, no more than so, and pretended to his"
5798,SCENE V.,father that he had just then got the gripes: whereupon his father went
5799,SCENE V.,"out to call a physician, and his man ran away with the petticoat."
5800,SCENE V.,
5801,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Well, and what follow'd upon that?"
5802,SCENE V.,
5803,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Nothing, no earthly thing, I vow to gad."
5804,SCENE V.,
5805,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ On my word, Mr. Bayes, there you hit it."
5806,SCENE V.,
5807,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Yes, it gave a world of content. And then I paid 'em away"
5808,SCENE V.,"besides; for it made them all talk beastly: ha, ha, ha, beastly!"
5809,SCENE V.,"downright beastly upon the stage, egad, ha, ha, ha! but with an infinite"
5810,SCENE V.,"deal of wit, that I must say."
5811,SCENE V.,
5812,SCENE V.,"_Johns._ That, ay, that, we know well enough, can never fail you."
5813,SCENE V.,
5814,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ No, egad, can't it. Come, bring in the dance."
5815,SCENE V.,
5816,SCENE V.,[_Exit to call the Players._
5817,SCENE V.,
5818,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Now, the plague take thee for a silly, confident, unnatural,"
5819,SCENE V.,fulsome rogue.
5820,SCENE V.,
5821,SCENE V.,_Enter_ BAYES _and_ PLAYERS.
5822,SCENE V.,
5823,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ Pray dance well before these gentlemen; you are commonly so
5824,SCENE V.,"lazy, but you should be light and easy, tah, tah, tah."
5825,SCENE V.,
5826,SCENE V.,"[_All the while they dance_, BAYES _puts them out"
5827,SCENE V.,with teaching them._
5828,SCENE V.,
5829,SCENE V.,"Well, gentlemen, you'll see this dance, if I am not deceiv'd, take very"
5830,SCENE V.,"well upon the stage, when they are perfect in their motions, and all that."
5831,SCENE V.,
5832,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ I don't know how 'twill take, sir; but I am sure you sweat hard"
5833,SCENE V.,for't.
5834,SCENE V.,
5835,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Ay, sir, it costs me more pains and trouble to do these things"
5836,SCENE V.,than almost the things are worth.
5837,SCENE V.,
5838,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ By my troth, I think so, sir."
5839,SCENE V.,
5840,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Not for the things themselves; for I could write you, sir, forty"
5841,SCENE V.,"of 'em in a day: but, egad, these players are such dull persons, that if"
5842,SCENE V.,"a man be not by 'em upon every point, and at every turn, egad, they'll"
5843,SCENE V.,"mistake you, sir, and spoil all."
5844,SCENE V.,
5845,SCENE V.,_Enter a_ PLAYER.
5846,SCENE V.,
5847,SCENE V.,"What, is the funeral ready?"
5848,SCENE V.,
5849,SCENE V.,"_Play._ Yes, sir."
5850,SCENE V.,
5851,SCENE V.,_Bayes._ And is the lance fill'd with wine?
5852,SCENE V.,
5853,SCENE V.,"_Play._ Sir, 'tis just now a-doing."
5854,SCENE V.,
5855,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ Stay, then, I'll do it myself."
5856,SCENE V.,
5857,SCENE V.,"_Smith._ Come, let's go with him."
5858,SCENE V.,
5859,SCENE V.,"_Bayes._ A match. But, Mr. Johnson, egad, I am not like other persons;"
5860,SCENE V.,"they care not what becomes of their things, so they can but get money"
5861,SCENE V.,"for 'em: now, egad, when I write, if it be not just as it should be in"
5862,SCENE V.,"every circumstance, to every particular, egad, I am no more able to"
5863,SCENE V.,"endure it, I am not myself, I'm out of my wits, and all that; I'm the"
5864,SCENE V.,strangest person in the whole world: for what care I for money? I write
5865,SCENE V.,for reputation.

5875,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5876,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Gentlemen, because I would not have any two things alike in this"
5877,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"play, the last act beginning with a witty scene of mirth, I make this to"
5878,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,begin with a funeral.
5879,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5880,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ And is that all your reason for it, Mr. Bayes?"
5881,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5882,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, sir, I have a precedent for it besides. A person of honour,"
5883,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"and a scholar, brought in his funeral just so;[35] and he was one, let"
5884,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"me tell you, that knew as well what belong'd to a funeral as any man in"
5885,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"England, egad."
5886,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5887,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Nay, if that be so, you are safe."
5888,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5889,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Egad, but I have another device, a frolic, which I think yet"
5890,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"better than all this; not for the plot or characters (for, in my heroic"
5891,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"plays, I make no difference as to those matters), but for another"
5892,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,contrivance.
5893,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5894,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ What is that, I pray?"
5895,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5896,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, I have design'd a conquest that cannot possibly, egad, be"
5897,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"acted in less than a whole week; and I'll speak a bold word, it shall"
5898,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"drum, trumpet, shout, and battle, egad, with any the most warlike tragedy"
5899,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"we have, either ancient or modern.[36]"
5900,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5901,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Ay, marry, sir, there you say something."
5902,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5903,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ And pray, sir, how have you order'd this same frolic of yours?"
5904,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5905,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Faith, sir, by the rule of romance; for example, they divide"
5906,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"their things into three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or as many tomes"
5907,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,as they please. Now I would very fain know what should hinder me from
5908,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"doing the same with my things, if I please?"
5909,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5910,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Nay, if you should not be master of your own works, 'tis very"
5911,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,hard.
5912,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5913,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ That is my sense. And then, sir, this contrivance of mine has"
5914,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,something of the reason of a play in it too; for as every one makes you
5915,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"five acts to one play, what do I, but make five plays to one plot: by"
5916,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,which means the auditors have every day a new thing.
5917,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5918,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Most admirably good, i'faith! and must certainly take, because"
5919,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,it is not tedious.
5920,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5921,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Ay, sir, I know that; there's the main point. And then upon"
5922,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"Saturday to make a close of all (for I ever begin upon a Monday), I make"
5923,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"you, sir, a sixth play that sums up the whole matter to 'em, and all"
5924,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"that, for fear they should have forgot it."
5925,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5926,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ That consideration, Mr. Bayes, indeed I think will be very"
5927,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,necessary.
5928,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5929,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ And when comes in your share, pray, sir?"
5930,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5931,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ The third week.
5932,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5933,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ I vow you'll get a world of money.
5934,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5935,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, faith, a man must live; and if you don't thus pitch upon"
5936,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"some new device, egad, you'll never do't; for this age (take it o' my"
5937,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,word) is somewhat hard to please. But there is one pretty odd passage in
5938,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"the last of these plays, which may be executed two several ways, wherein"
5939,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"I'd have your opinion, gentlemen."
5940,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5941,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ What is't, sir."
5942,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5943,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, I make a male person to be in love with a female."
5944,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5945,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Do you mean that, Mr. Bayes, for a new thing?"
5946,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5947,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Yes, sir, as I have order'd it. You shall hear: he having"
5948,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"passionately lov'd her through my five whole plays, finding at last that"
5949,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"she consents to his love, just after that his mother had appear'd to him"
5950,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"like a ghost, he kills himself: that's one way. The other is, that she"
5951,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"coming at last to love him, with as violent a passion as he lov'd her,"
5952,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"she kills herself. Now my question is, which of these two persons should"
5953,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,suffer upon this occasion?
5954,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5955,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ By my troth, it is a very hard case to decide."
5956,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5957,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ The hardest in the world, egad, and has puzzled this pate very"
5958,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"much. What say you, Mr. Smith?"
5959,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5960,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Why truly, Mr. Bayes, if it might stand with your justice now,"
5961,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,I would spare 'em both.
5962,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5963,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Egad, and I think--ha--why then, I'll make him hinder her from"
5964,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"killing herself. Ay, it shall be so. Come, come, bring in the funeral."
5965,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5966,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Enter a Funeral, with the two_ USURPERS _and Attendants_."
5967,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5968,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"Lay it down there; no, no, here, sir. So now speak."
5969,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5970,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_K. Ush._    Set down the funeral pile, and let our grief"
5971,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,Receive from its embraces some relief.

5979,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_non ultra_, egad; you must know they were both in love with her."
5980,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5981,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ With her! with whom?
5982,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5983,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, this is Lardella's funeral."

5985,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Lardella! ay, who is she?"
5986,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5987,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, the sister of Drawcansir; a lady that was drown'd at"
5988,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"sea, and had a wave for her winding-sheet.[37]"
5989,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5990,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_K. Ush._ Lardella, O Lardella, from above"
5991,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,Behold the tragic issues of our love:
5992,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"Pity us, sinking under grief and pain,"

5994,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5995,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Look you now, you see I told you true."

5997,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ Ay, sir, and I thank you for it very kindly."
5998,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
5999,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Ay, egad, but you will not have patience; honest Mr.--a--you"
6000,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,will not have patience.
6001,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6002,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ Pray, Mr. Bayes, who is that Drawcansir?"
6003,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6004,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, a fierce hero, that frights his mistress, snubs up"
6005,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"kings, baffles armies, and does what he will, without regard to numbers,"
6006,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"good manners, or justice.[38]"
6007,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6008,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ A very pretty character!
6009,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6010,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ But, Mr. Bayes, I thought your heroes had ever been men of great"
6011,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,humanity and justice.
6012,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6013,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Yes, they have been so; but for my part, I prefer that one"
6014,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"quality of singly beating of whole armies, above all your moral virtues"
6015,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"put together, egad. You shall see him come in presently. Zookers, why"
6016,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,don't you read the paper?

6023,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"[_Takes the paper from off the coffin._ Stay, it's an ill hand, I must"
6024,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"use my spectacles. This now is a copy of verses, which I make Lardella"

6027,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6028,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ A very shrewd design that, upon my word, Mr. Bayes."
6029,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6030,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ And what do you think now, I fancy her to make love like, here,"
6031,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,in this paper?

6033,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ Like a woman: what should she make love like?

6039,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, sir; like a humble-bee."

6041,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ I confess, that I should not have fancy'd."
6042,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6043,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ It may be so, sir; but it is tho', in order to the opinion of"
6044,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"some of our ancient philosophers, who held the transmigration of the soul."

6144,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_K. Phys._ Well, since alive Lardella's found,"
6145,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,Let in full bowls her health go round.
6146,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,[_The two Usurpers take each of them
6147,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,a bowl in their hands._
6148,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6149,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_K. Ush._ But where's the wine?
6150,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6151,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Pal._ That shall be mine.
6152,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"Lo, from this conquering lance"
6153,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,Does flow the purest wine of France:
6154,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,[_Fills the bowls out of her lance._
6155,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"And to appease your hunger, I"
6156,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,Have in my helmet brought a pie:
6157,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"Lastly, to bear a part with these,"
6158,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,Behold a buckler made of cheese.[40]      [_Vanish_ PALLAS.
6159,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6160,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ That's the banquet. Are you satisfied now, sir?"
6161,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6162,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ By my troth now, that is new, and more than I expected."
6163,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6164,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Yes, I knew this would please you; for the chief art in poetry"
6165,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"is to elevate your expectation, and then bring you off some extraordinary"
6166,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,way.
6167,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6168,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Enter_ DRAWCANSIR.
6169,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6170,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_K. Phys._ What man is this that dares disturb our feast?
6171,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6172,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Draw._ He that dares drink, and for that drink dares die;"
6173,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"And knowing this, dares yet drink on, am I.[41]"
6174,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6175,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ That is, Mr. Bayes, as much as to say, that though he would"
6176,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"rather die than not drink, yet he would fain drink for all that too."
6177,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6178,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Right; that's the conceit on't.
6179,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6180,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ 'Tis a marvellous good one, I swear."
6181,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6182,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Now, there are some critics that have advis'd me to put out the"
6183,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"second _dare_, and print _must_ in the place on't;[42] but, egad, I think"
6184,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,'tis better thus a great deal.
6185,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6186,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Johns._ Whoo! a thousand times.
6187,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6188,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Go on then.
6189,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6190,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_K. Ush._ Sir, if you please, we should be glad to know,"
6191,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"How long you here will stay, how soon you'll go?"
6192,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6193,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Is not that now like a well-bred person, egad? so modest, so"
6194,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,gent!
6195,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6196,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ O very like.
6197,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6198,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Draw._ You shall not know how long I here will stay;
6199,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,But you shall know I'll take your bowls away.[43]
6200,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6201,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,[_Snatches the bowls out of the kings' hands and drinks them off._
6202,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6203,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ But, Mr. Bayes, is that, too, modest and gent?"
6204,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6205,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ No, egad, sir, but 'tis great."
6206,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6207,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_K. Ush._ Tho', brother, this grum stranger be a clown,"
6208,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,He'll leave us sure a little to gulp down.
6209,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6210,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Draw._ Whoe'er to gulp one drop of this dare think,"
6211,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"I'll stare away his very power to drink,[44]"
6212,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6213,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,[_The two Kings sneak off the stage with
6214,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,their attendants._
6215,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6216,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"I drink, I huff, I strut, look big and stare;"
6217,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,And all this I can do because I dare.[45]          [_Exit._
6218,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6219,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ I suppose, Mr. Bayes, this is the fierce hero you spoke of?"
6220,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6221,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Yes; but this is nothing. You shall see him in the last act
6222,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"win above a dozen battles, one after another, egad, as fast as they can"
6223,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,possibly come upon the stage.
6224,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6225,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ That will be a fight worth the seeing, indeed."
6226,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6227,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ But pray, Mr. Bayes, why do you make the kings let him use them"
6228,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,so scurvily?
6229,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6230,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Bayes._ Phoo! that's to raise the character of Drawcansir.
6231,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6232,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Johns._ O' my word, that was well thought on."
6233,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6234,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Now, sirs, I'll show you a scene indeed; or rather, indeed, the"
6235,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,scene of scenes. 'Tis an heroic scene.
6236,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6237,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Smith._ And pray, what's your design in this scene?"
6238,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6239,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Why, sir, my design is gilded truncheons, forc'd conceit, smooth"
6240,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"verse and a rant; in fine, if this scene don't take, egad, I'll write no"
6241,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"more. Come, come in, Mr.--a--nay, come in as many as you can. Gentlemen,"
6242,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"I must desire you to remove a little, for I must fill the stage."
6243,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6244,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,_Smith._ Why fill the stage?
6245,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6246,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,"_Bayes._ Oh, sir, because your heroic verse never sounds well but when"
6247,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,the stage is full.
6248,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6249,ACT IV.--SCENE I.,
6250,SCENE II.,SCENE II.
6251,SCENE II.,
6252,SCENE II.,_Enter_ PRINCE PRETTYMAN _and_ PRINCE VOLSCIUS.
6253,SCENE II.,
6254,SCENE II.,"Nay, hold, hold; pray by your leave a little. Look you, sir, the drift of"
6255,SCENE II.,this scene is somewhat more than ordinary; for I make 'em both fall out
6256,SCENE II.,because they are not in love with the same woman.
6257,SCENE II.,
6258,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Not in love? You mean, I suppose, because they are in love, Mr."
6259,SCENE II.,Bayes?
6260,SCENE II.,
6261,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ No, sir; I say not in love; there's a new conceit for you. Now"
6262,SCENE II.,speak.
6263,SCENE II.,
6264,SCENE II.,"_Pret._ Since fate, Prince Volscius, now has found the way"
6265,SCENE II.,"For our so long'd-for meeting here this day,"
6266,SCENE II.,Lend thy attention to my grand concern.
6267,SCENE II.,
6268,SCENE II.,_Vols._ I gladly would that story from thee learn;
6269,SCENE II.,"But thou to love dost, Prettyman, incline;"
6270,SCENE II.,Yet love in thy breast is not love in mine.
6271,SCENE II.,
6272,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ Antithesis! thine and mine.
6273,SCENE II.,
6274,SCENE II.,"_Pret._ Since love itself's the same, why should it be"
6275,SCENE II.,Diff'ring in you from what it is in me?
6276,SCENE II.,
6277,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Reasoning! egad, I love reasoning in verse."
6278,SCENE II.,
6279,SCENE II.,"_Vols._ Love takes, caméleon-like, a various dye"
6280,SCENE II.,From every plant on which itself doth lie.
6281,SCENE II.,
6282,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ Simile!
6283,SCENE II.,
6284,SCENE II.,_Pret._ Let not thy love the course of nature fright:
6285,SCENE II.,Nature does most in harmony delight.
6286,SCENE II.,
6287,SCENE II.,"_Vols._ How weak a deity would nature prove,"
6288,SCENE II.,Contending with the powerful god of love!
6289,SCENE II.,
6290,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ There's a great verse!
6291,SCENE II.,
6292,SCENE II.,_Vols._ If incense thou wilt offer at the shrine
6293,SCENE II.,"Of mighty Love, burn it to none but mine."
6294,SCENE II.,Her rosy lips eternal sweets exhale;
6295,SCENE II.,And her bright flames make all flames else look pale.
6296,SCENE II.,
6297,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Egad, that is right."
6298,SCENE II.,
6299,SCENE II.,_Pret._ Perhaps dull incense may thy love suffice;
6300,SCENE II.,But mine must be ador'd with sacrifice.
6301,SCENE II.,"All hearts turn ashes, which her eyes control:"
6302,SCENE II.,"The body they consume, as well as soul."
6303,SCENE II.,
6304,SCENE II.,_Vols._ My love has yet a power more divine;
6305,SCENE II.,"Victims her altars burn not, but refine;"
6306,SCENE II.,"Amidst the flames they ne'er give up the ghost,"
6307,SCENE II.,"But, with her looks, revive still as they roast."
6308,SCENE II.,In spite of pain and death they're kept alive;
6309,SCENE II.,Her fiery eyes make 'em in fire survive.
6310,SCENE II.,
6311,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ That is as well, egad, as I can do."
6312,SCENE II.,
6313,SCENE II.,_Vols._ Let my Parthenope at length prevail.
6314,SCENE II.,
6315,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Civil, egad."
6316,SCENE II.,
6317,SCENE II.,_Pret._ I'll sooner have a passion for a whale;
6318,SCENE II.,"In whose vast bulk, tho' store of oil doth lie,"
6319,SCENE II.,"We find more shape, more beauty in a fly."
6320,SCENE II.,
6321,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ That's uncivil, egad."
6322,SCENE II.,
6323,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Yes; but as far-fetched a fancy, tho', egad, as e'er you saw."
6324,SCENE II.,
6325,SCENE II.,"_Vols._ Soft, Prettyman, let not thy vain pretence"
6326,SCENE II.,Of perfect love defame love's excellence:
6327,SCENE II.,"Parthenope is, sure, as far above"
6328,SCENE II.,"All other loves, as above all is Love."
6329,SCENE II.,
6330,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Ah! egad, that strikes me."
6331,SCENE II.,
6332,SCENE II.,"_Pret._ To blame my Cloris, gods would not pretend--"
6333,SCENE II.,
6334,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ Now mark--
6335,SCENE II.,
6336,SCENE II.,"_Vols._ Were all gods join'd, they could not hope to mend"
6337,SCENE II.,My better choice: for fair Parthenope
6338,SCENE II.,Gods would themselves un-god themselves to see.[46]
6339,SCENE II.,
6340,SCENE II.,_Bayes._ Now the rant's a-coming.
6341,SCENE II.,
6342,SCENE II.,"_Pret._ Durst any of the gods be so uncivil,"
6343,SCENE II.,I'd make that god subscribe himself a devil.[47]
6344,SCENE II.,
6345,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Ay, gadzookers, that's well writ!"
6346,SCENE II.,"[_Scratching his head, his peruke falls off._"
6347,SCENE II.,
6348,SCENE II.,"_Vols._ Could'st thou that god from heaven to earth translate,"
6349,SCENE II.,He could not fear to want a heav'nly state;
6350,SCENE II.,"Parthenope, on earth, can heav'n create."
6351,SCENE II.,
6352,SCENE II.,"_Pret._ Cloris does heav'n itself so far excel,"
6353,SCENE II.,She can transcend the joys of heav'n in hell.
6354,SCENE II.,
6355,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ There's a bold flight for you now! 'sdeath, I have lost my"
6356,SCENE II.,"peruke. Well, gentlemen, this is what I never yet saw any one could"
6357,SCENE II.,"write, but myself. Here's true spirit and flame all through, egad. So,"
6358,SCENE II.,"so, pray clear the stage."
6359,SCENE II.,
6360,SCENE II.,[_He puts 'em off the stage._
6361,SCENE II.,
6362,SCENE II.,_Johns._ I wonder how the coxcomb has got the knack of writing smooth
6363,SCENE II.,verse thus.
6364,SCENE II.,
6365,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Why, there's no need of brain for this: 'tis but scanning the"
6366,SCENE II.,labours on the finger; but where's the sense of it?
6367,SCENE II.,
6368,SCENE II.,_Johns._ Oh! for that he desires to be excus'd: he is too proud a man to
6369,SCENE II.,"creep servilely after sense, I assure you.[48] But pray, Mr. Bayes, why"
6370,SCENE II.,"is this scene all in verse? _Bayes._ Oh, sir, the subject is too great"
6371,SCENE II.,for prose.
6372,SCENE II.,
6373,SCENE II.,"_Smith._ Well said, i'faith; I'll give thee a pot of ale for that answer;"
6374,SCENE II.,'tis well worth it.
6375,SCENE II.,
6376,SCENE II.,"_Bayes._ Come, with all my heart."
6377,SCENE II.,I'll make that god subscribe himself a devil;
6378,SCENE II.,"That single line, egad, is worth all that my brother poets ever writ."
6379,SCENE II.,Let down the curtain.                            [_Exeunt._

11865,MATILDA.,"perfidy of a monk--yes, Matilda! for thy sake--alive amidst the"
11866,MATILDA.,dead--chained--coffined--confined--cut off from the converse of my
11867,MATILDA.,fellow-men. Soft! what have we here? [_stumbles over a bundle of
11868,MATILDA.,"sticks_.] This cavern is so dark, that I can scarcely distinguish the"
11869,MATILDA.,"objects under my feet. Oh! the register of my captivity. Let me see,"
11870,MATILDA.,how stands the account? [_takes up the sticks and turns them over with
11871,MATILDA.,"a melancholy air; then stands silent for a few moments, as if absorbed"
11872,MATILDA.,in calculation_.] Eleven years and fifteen days! Hah! the twenty-eighth
11873,MATILDA.,of August! How does the recollection of it vibrate on my heart! It was
11874,MATILDA.,on this day that I took my last leave of my Matilda. It was a summer
11875,MATILDA.,"evening--her melting hand seemed to dissolve in mine, as I press'd it to"
11876,MATILDA.,my bosom. Some demon whispered me that I should never see her more. I
11877,MATILDA.,stood gazing on the hated vehicle which was conveying her away for ever.
11878,MATILDA.,The tears were petrified under my eyelids. My heart was crystallized with
11879,MATILDA.,"agony. Anon, I looked along the road. The diligence seemed to diminish"
11880,MATILDA.,"every instant. I felt my heart beat against its prison, as if anxious"
11881,MATILDA.,to leap out and overtake it. My soul whirled round as I watched the
11882,MATILDA.,"rotation of the hinder wheels. A long trail of glory followed after her,"
11883,MATILDA.,"and mingled with the dust--it was the emanation of Divinity, luminous"
11884,MATILDA.,"with love and beauty, like the splendour of the setting sun; but it told"
11885,MATILDA.,"me that the sun of my joys was sunk for ever. Yes, here in the depths"
11886,MATILDA.,of an eternal dungeon--in the nursing cradle of hell--the suburbs of
11887,MATILDA.,"perdition --in a nest of demons, where despair, in vain, sits brooding"
11888,MATILDA.,over the putrid eggs of hope; where agony woos the embrace of death;
11889,MATILDA.,"where patience, beside the bottomless pool of despondency, sits angling"
11890,MATILDA.,"for impossibilities. Yet even _here_, to behold her, to embrace her--yes,"
11891,MATILDA.,"Matilda, whether in this dark abode, amidst toads and spiders, or in a"
11892,MATILDA.,"royal palace, amidst the more loathsome reptiles of a Court, would be"
11893,MATILDA.,indifferent to me. Angels would shower down their hymns of gratulation
11894,MATILDA.,upon our heads--while fiends would envy the eternity of suffering
11895,MATILDA.,"love.... Soft, what air was that? it seemed a sound of more than human"
11896,MATILDA.,warblings. Again [_listens attentively for some minutes_]--only the wind.
11897,MATILDA.,"It is well, however; it reminds me of that melancholy air which has so"
11898,MATILDA.,often solaced the hours of my captivity. Let me see whether the damps of
11899,MATILDA.,"this dungeon have not yet injured my guitar. [_Takes his guitar, tunes"

11978,VI.,"We have received, in the course of the last week, several long, and to"
11979,VI.,"say the truth, dull letters, from unknown hands, reflecting, in very"
11980,VI.,"severe terms, on Mr. Higgins, for having, as it is affirmed, attempted"
11981,VI.,"to pass upon the world, as a faithful sample of the productions of the"
11982,VI.,"German Theatre, a performance no way resembling any of those pieces,"
11983,VI.,"which have of late excited, and which bid fair to engross the admiration"
11984,VI.,of the British public.
11985,VI.,
11986,VI.,As we cannot but consider ourselves as the guardians of Mr. Higgins's
11987,VI.,"literary reputation, in respect to every work of his which is conveyed"
11988,VI.,"to the world through the medium of our paper (though, what we think of"
11989,VI.,"the danger of his principles, we have already sufficiently explained for"
11990,VI.,"ourselves, and have, we trust, succeeded in putting our readers upon"
11991,VI.,their guard against them)--we hold ourselves bound not only to justify
11992,VI.,"the fidelity of the imitation, but (contrary to our original intention)"
11993,VI.,"to give a further specimen of it in our present number, in order to bring"
11994,VI.,the question more fairly to issue between our author and his calumniators.
11995,VI.,
11996,VI.,"In the first place, we are to observe that Mr. Higgins professes to"
11997,VI.,have taken his notion of German plays wholly from the translations which
11998,VI.,have appeared in our language. If _they_ are totally dissimilar from
11999,VI.,"the originals, Mr. H. may undoubtedly have been led into error; but the"
12000,VI.,"fault is in the translators, not in him. That he does not differ widely"
12001,VI.,"from the models which he proposed to himself, we have it in our power"
12002,VI.,"to prove satisfactorily; and might have done so in our last number, by"
12003,VI.,"subjoining to each particular passage of his play, the scene in some one"
12004,VI.,"or other of the German plays, which he had in view when he wrote it."
12005,VI.,These parallel passages were faithfully pointed out to us by Mr. H. with
12006,VI.,that candour which marks his character; and if they were suppressed by
12007,VI.,"us (as in truth they were), on our heads be the blame, whatever it may"
12008,VI.,"be. Little, indeed, did we think of the imputation which the omission"
12009,VI.,"would bring upon Mr. H., as, in fact, our principal reason for it was the"
12010,VI.,"apprehension that, from the extreme closeness of the imitation in most"
12011,VI.,"instances, he would lose in praise for invention more than he would gain"
12012,VI.,in credit for fidelity.
12013,VI.,
12014,VI.,"The meeting between Matilda and Cecilia, for example, in the first"
12015,VI.,"act of the ""Rovers,"" and their sudden intimacy, has been censured as"
12016,VI.,"unnatural. Be it so. It is taken _almost word for word_ from ""Stella,"""
12017,VI.,a German (or professedly a German) piece now much in vogue; from which
12018,VI.,"also the catastrophe of Mr. Higgins's play is in part borrowed, so far as"
12019,VI.,"relates to the agreement to which the ladies come, as the reader will see"
12020,VI.,"by-and-by, to share Casimere between them."
12021,VI.,
12022,VI.,The dinner scene is copied partly from the published translation of the
12023,VI.,"""Stranger,"" and partly from the first scene of ""Stella."" The song of"
12024,VI.,"Rogero, with which the first act concludes, is admitted on all hands to"
12025,VI.,be in the very first taste; and if no German original is to be found for
12026,VI.,"it, so much the worse for the credit of German literature."
12027,VI.,
12028,VI.,"An objection has been made by one anonymous letter-writer, to the names"
12029,VI.,"of Puddingfield and Beefington, as little likely to have been assigned"
12030,VI.,to English characters by any author of taste or discernment. In answer
12031,VI.,"to this objection, we have, in the first place, to admit that a small,"
12032,VI.,and we hope not an unwarrantable alteration has been made by us since
12033,VI.,the MS. has been in our hands. These names stood originally Puddincrantz
12034,VI.,"and Beefinstern, which sounded to our ears as being liable, especially"
12035,VI.,"the latter, to a ridiculous inflection--a difficulty that could only be"
12036,VI.,removed by furnishing them with English terminations. With regard to the
12037,VI.,"more substantial syllables of the names, our author proceeded in all"
12038,VI.,"probability on the authority of Goldoni, who, though not a German, is an"
12039,VI.,"Italian writer of considerable reputation; and who, having heard that"
12040,VI.,"the English were distinguished for their love of liberty and beef, has"
12041,VI.,"judiciously compounded the two words _Runnymede_ and _beef_, and thereby"
12042,VI.,"produced an English nobleman, whom he styles _Lord Runnybeef_."
12043,VI.,
12044,VI.,To dwell no longer on particular passages--the best way perhaps of
12045,VI.,"explaining the whole scope and view of Mr. H.'s imitation, will be to"
12046,VI.,"transcribe the short sketch of the plot, which that gentleman transmitted"
12047,VI.,"to us, together with his drama; and which it is perhaps the more"
12048,VI.,"necessary to give at length, as the limits of our paper not allowing of"
12049,VI.,"the publication of the whole piece, some general knowledge of its main"
12050,VI.,"design may be acceptable to our readers, in order to enable them to judge"
12051,VI.,of the several extracts which we lay before them.

12097,PLOT.,advertised (by an anonymous letter) of the falsehood of his Kamtschatka

12099,PLOT.,
12100,PLOT.,It is at this point of time the play opens--with the accidental meeting
12101,PLOT.,of Cecilia and Matilda at the inn at Weimar. Casimere arrives there soon

12109,PLOT.,"lodging in the same house with Puddincrantz and Beefinstern, two English"
12110,PLOT.,"noblemen, whom the tyranny of King John has obliged to fly from their"
12111,PLOT.,"country; and who, after wandering about the Continent for some time, have"
12112,PLOT.,fixed their residence at Weimar.
12113,PLOT.,
12114,PLOT.,"The news of the signature of Magna Charta arriving, determines"
12115,PLOT.,Puddincrantz and Beefinstern to return to England. Young Pottingen opens
12116,PLOT.,"his case to them, and entreats them to stay to assist him in the object"
12117,PLOT.,of his search. This they refuse; but coming to the inn where they are
12118,PLOT.,"to set off for Hamburgh, they meet Casimere, from whom they have both"
12119,PLOT.,received many civilities in Poland.
12120,PLOT.,
12121,PLOT.,"Casimere, by this time tired of his ""Double Arrangement,"" and having"
12122,PLOT.,learned from the waiter that Rogero is confined in the vaults of the

12124,PLOT.,make over Matilda to him as the price of his deliverance. He communicates
12125,PLOT.,"his scheme to Puddingfield and Beefington, who agree to assist him; as"
12126,PLOT.,also does young Pottingen. The waiter of the inn proving to be a _Knight
12127,PLOT.,"Templar_ in disguise, is appointed leader of the expedition. A band of"
12128,PLOT.,"troubadours, who happen to be returning from the Crusades, and a company"
12129,PLOT.,"of Austrian and Prussian Grenadiers returning from the Seven Years' War,"
12130,PLOT.,are engaged as troops.
12131,PLOT.,
12132,PLOT.,The attack on the Abbey is made with success. The Count of Weimar and
12133,PLOT.,"Gaspar, who are feasting with the prior, are seized and beheaded in the"
12134,PLOT.,"refectory. The prior is thrown into the dungeon, from which Rogero is"
12135,PLOT.,"rescued. Matilda and Cecilia rush in. The former recognizes Rogero, and"
12136,PLOT.,agrees to live with him. The children are produced on all sides; and
12137,PLOT.,"young Pottingen is commissioned to write to his father, the doctor, to"
12138,PLOT.,"detail the joyful events which have taken place, and to invite him to"
12139,PLOT.,"Weimar, to partake of the general felicity."

12848,DISTAFFINA.,
12849,DISTAFFINA.,"_King._ And think not, maiden, I could e'er design"

12851,DISTAFFINA.,"No! the half crown that ting'd thy cheeks with red,"
12852,DISTAFFINA.,"And bade fierce anger o'er thy beauties spread,"

12869,DISTAFFINA.,
12870,DISTAFFINA.,"_Distaf._ La, sir! I'd not say no for twenty pound;"

13217,PREFACE.,
13218,PREFACE.,"On the 14th of August, 1812, the following advertisement appeared in most"
13219,PREFACE.,of the daily papers:
13220,PREFACE.,
13221,PREFACE.,"""_Rebuilding of Drury Lane Theatre._"
13222,PREFACE.,
13223,PREFACE.,"""The Committee are desirous of promoting a free and fair competition"
13224,PREFACE.,"for an Address to be spoken upon the opening of the Theatre, which will"
13225,PREFACE.,"take place, on the 10th of October next. They have therefore thought"
13226,PREFACE.,"fit to announce to the public, that they will be glad to receive any"
13227,PREFACE.,"such compositions, addressed to their Secretary, at the Treasury Office,"
13228,PREFACE.,"in Drury Lane, on or before the 10th of September, sealed up, with a"
13229,PREFACE.,"distinguishing word, number, or motto, on the cover, corresponding with"
13230,PREFACE.,the inscription on a separate sealed paper containing the name of the
13231,PREFACE.,"author, which will not be opened, unless containing the name of the"
13232,PREFACE.,"successful candidate."""
13233,PREFACE.,
13234,PREFACE.,"Upon the propriety of this plan, men's minds were, as they usually are"
13235,PREFACE.,"upon matters of moment, much divided. Some thought it a fair promise of"
13236,PREFACE.,the future intention of the Committee to abolish that phalanx of authors
13237,PREFACE.,"who usurp the stage, to the exclusion of a large assortment of dramatic"
13238,PREFACE.,"talent blushing unseen in the background; while others contended, that"
13239,PREFACE.,the scheme would prevent men of real eminence from descending into an
13240,PREFACE.,"amphitheatre in which all Grub Street (that is to say, all London and"
13241,PREFACE.,Westminster) would be arrayed against them. The event has proved both
13242,PREFACE.,"parties to be in a degree right, and in a degree wrong. One hundred and"
13243,PREFACE.,"twelve Addresses have been sent in, each sealed and signed, and mottoed,"
13244,PREFACE.,"""as per order,"" some written by men of great, some by men of little, and"
13245,PREFACE.,some by men of no talent.
13246,PREFACE.,
13247,PREFACE.,"Many of the public prints have censured the taste of the Committee, in"
13248,PREFACE.,thus contracting for Addresses as they would for nails--by the gross; but
13249,PREFACE.,it is surprising that none should have censured their _temerity_. One
13250,PREFACE.,"hundred and eleven of the Addresses must, of course, be unsuccessful:"
13251,PREFACE.,"to each of the authors, thus infallibly classed with the _genus"
13252,PREFACE.,"irritabile_, it would be very hard to deny six staunch friends, who"
13253,PREFACE.,"consider his the best of all possible Addresses, and whose tongues will"
13254,PREFACE.,"be as ready to laud him as to hiss his adversary. These, with the potent"
13255,PREFACE.,"aid of the bard himself, make seven foes per Address, and thus will be"
13256,PREFACE.,"created seven hundred and seventy-seven implacable auditors, prepared to"
13257,PREFACE.,condemn the strains of Apollo himself; a band of adversaries which no
13258,PREFACE.,prudent manager would think of exasperating.
13259,PREFACE.,
13260,PREFACE.,But leaving the Committee to encounter the responsibility they have
13261,PREFACE.,"incurred, the public have at least to thank them for ascertaining"
13262,PREFACE.,"and establishing one point, which might otherwise have admitted of"
13263,PREFACE.,controversy. When it is considered that many amateur writers have been
13264,PREFACE.,"discouraged from becoming competitors, and that few, if any, of the"
13265,PREFACE.,"professional authors can afford to write for nothing, and of course"
13266,PREFACE.,"have not been candidates for the honorary prize at Drury Lane, we may"
13267,PREFACE.,"confidently pronounce, that, as far as regards _number_, the present"
13268,PREFACE.,is undoubtedly the Augustan age of English poetry. Whether or not this
13269,PREFACE.,"distinction will be extended to the _quality_ of its productions, must"
13270,PREFACE.,"be decided at the tribunal of posterity, though the natural anxiety of"
13271,PREFACE.,"our authors on this score ought to be considerably diminished, when they"
13272,PREFACE.,"reflect how few will, in all probability, be had up for judgment."
13273,PREFACE.,
13274,PREFACE.,It is not necessary for the Editor to mention the manner in which he
13275,PREFACE.,"became possessed of this ""fair sample of the present state of poetry in"
13276,PREFACE.,"Great Britain."" It was his first intention to publish the whole; but a"
13277,PREFACE.,"little reflection convinced him that, by so doing, he might depress the"
13278,PREFACE.,"good, without elevating the bad. He has therefore culled what had the"
13279,PREFACE.,"appearance of flowers, from what possessed the reality of weeds, and"
13280,PREFACE.,"is extremely sorry that, in so doing, he has diminished his collection"
13281,PREFACE.,to twenty-one. Those which he has rejected may possibly make their
13282,PREFACE.,"appearance in a separate volume, or they may be admitted as volunteers"
13283,PREFACE.,"in the files of some of the newspapers; or, at all events, they are sure"
13284,PREFACE.,"of being received among the awkward squad of the Magazines. In general,"
13285,PREFACE.,they bear a close resemblance to each other: thirty of them contain
13286,PREFACE.,"extravagant compliments to the immortal Wellington, and the indefatigable"
13287,PREFACE.,"Whitbread; and, as the last-mentioned gentleman is said to dislike praise"
13288,PREFACE.,"in the exact proportion in which he deserves it, these laudatory writers"
13289,PREFACE.,"have probably been only building a wall, against which they might run"
13290,PREFACE.,their own heads.
13291,PREFACE.,
13292,PREFACE.,The Editor here begs leave to advance a few words in behalf of that
13293,PREFACE.,"useful and much-abused bird, the Phoenix, and in so doing he is biassed"
13294,PREFACE.,"by no partiality, as he assures the reader he not only never saw one,"
13295,PREFACE.,but (_mirabile dictu!_) never caged one in a simile in the whole course
13296,PREFACE.,of his life. Not less than sixty-nine of the competitors have invoked
13297,PREFACE.,"the aid of this native of Arabia; but as from their manner of using him,"
13298,PREFACE.,"after they had caught him, he does not by any means appear to have been"
13299,PREFACE.,"a native of Arabia _Felix_, the Editor has left the proprietors to treat"
13300,PREFACE.,"with Mr. Polito, and refused to receive this _rara avis_, or black swan,"
13301,PREFACE.,"into the present collection. One exception occurs, in which the admirable"
13302,PREFACE.,treatment of this feathered incombustible entitles the author to great
13303,PREFACE.,"praise. That Address has been preserved, and in the ensuing pages takes"
13304,PREFACE.,"the lead, to which its dignity entitles it."
13305,PREFACE.,
13306,PREFACE.,Perhaps the reason why several of the subjoined productions of the MUSÆ
13307,PREFACE.,"LONDINENSES have failed of selection, may be discovered in their being"
13308,PREFACE.,"penned in a metre unusual upon occasions of this sort, and in their not"
13309,PREFACE.,"being written with that attention to stage effect, the want of which,"
13310,PREFACE.,"like want of manners in the concerns of life, is more prejudicial than"
13311,PREFACE.,"a deficiency of talent. There is an art in writing for the Theatre,"
13312,PREFACE.,"technically called _touch and go_, which is indispensable when we"
13313,PREFACE.,consider the small quantum of patience which so motley an assemblage as
13314,PREFACE.,a London audience can be expected to afford. All the contributors have
13315,PREFACE.,been very exact in sending their initials and mottoes. Those belonging
13316,PREFACE.,"to the present collection have been carefully preserved, and each has"
13317,PREFACE.,been affixed to its respective poem. The letters that accompanied the
13318,PREFACE.,"Addresses having been honourably destroyed unopened, it is impossible"
13319,PREFACE.,"to state the real authors with any certainty, but the ingenious reader,"
13320,PREFACE.,"after comparing the initials with the motto, and both with the poem, may"
13321,PREFACE.,form his own conclusions.
13322,PREFACE.,
13323,PREFACE.,The Editor does not anticipate any disapprobation from thus giving
13324,PREFACE.,"publicity to a small portion of the REJECTED ADDRESSES; for, unless he"
13325,PREFACE.,"is widely mistaken in assigning the respective authors, the fame of each"
13326,PREFACE.,individual is established on much too firm a basis to be shaken by so
13327,PREFACE.,trifling and evanescent a publication as the present:
13328,PREFACE.,
13329,PREFACE.,neque ego illi detrahere ausim
13330,PREFACE.,Hærentem capiti multâ cum laude coronam.
13331,PREFACE.,
13332,PREFACE.,"Of the numerous pieces already sent to the Committee for performance,"
13333,PREFACE.,"he has only availed himself of three vocal Travesties, which he has"
13334,PREFACE.,"selected, not for their merit, but simply for their brevity. Above"
13335,PREFACE.,"one hundred spectacles, melodramas, operas, and pantomimes have been"
13336,PREFACE.,"transmitted, besides the two first acts of one legitimate comedy. Some"
13337,PREFACE.,"of these evince considerable smartness of manual dialogue, and several"
13338,PREFACE.,"brilliant repartees of chairs, tables, and other inanimate wits; but the"
13339,PREFACE.,authors seem to have forgotten that in the new Drury Lane the audience
13340,PREFACE.,can hear as well as see. Of late our theatres have been so constructed
13341,PREFACE.,"that John Bull has been compelled to have very long ears, or none at"
13342,PREFACE.,"all; to keep them dangling about his skull like discarded servants,"
13343,PREFACE.,"while his eyes were gazing at piebalds and elephants, or else to stretch"
13344,PREFACE.,them out to an asinine length to catch the congenial sound of braying
13345,PREFACE.,"trumpets. An auricular revolution is, we trust, about to take place; and,"
13346,PREFACE.,as many people have been much puzzled to define the meaning of the new
13347,PREFACE.,"era, of which we have heard so much, we venture to pronounce, that as"
13348,PREFACE.,"far as regards Drury Lane Theatre, the new era means the reign of ears."
13349,PREFACE.,"If the past affords any pledge for the future, we may confidently expect"
13350,PREFACE.,"from the Committee of that House, everything that can be accomplished by"
13351,PREFACE.,the union of taste and assiduity.

14675,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"noxious nut. There indolence may repose, and inebriety revel; and the"

14684,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"frappant and tintinabulant appendages, now serves, as the entrance of"
14685,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"the lowly cottage, and now as the exit of a lady's bed-chamber; at one"

14687,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,yawning as the flood-gate to precipitate the Cyprians of St. Giles's into
14688,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"the embraces of Macheath. To elude this glaring absurdity, to give to"
14689,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,each respective mansion the door which the carpenter would doubtless have
14690,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"given, we vary our portal with the varying scene, passing from deal to"

14697,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"to please,"" should not have their own pleasures entirely overlooked."
14698,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,The children of Thespis are general in their censures of the architect
14699,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,in having placed the locality of exit at such a distance from the oily
14700,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of him who addresses you. I am,"
14701,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"cries the Queen of Terrors, robbed of my fair proportions. When the"
14702,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,king-killing Thane hints to the breathless auditory the murders he means
14703,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"to perpetrate in the castle of Macduff ""ere his purpose cool,"" so vast"
14704,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"is the interval he has to travel before he can escape from the stage,"
14705,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"that his purpose has even time to freeze. Your condition, cries the Muse"
14706,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"of Smiles, is hard, but it is cygnet's down in comparison with mine. The"
14707,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"peerless peer of capers and congees has laid it down as a rule, that the"
14708,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,best good thing uttered by the morning visitor should conduct him rapidly
14709,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"to the doorway, last impressions vieing in durability with first. But"
14710,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"when on this boarded elongation it falls to my lot to say a good thing,"
14711,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"to ejaculate ""keep moving,"" or to chaunt ""hic hoc horum genetivo,"" many"

14715,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"To objections like these, captiously urged and querulously maintained,"
14716,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,it is time that equity should conclusively reply. Deviation from
14717,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself for the consequences
14718,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,it generates. Let the actor consider the line of exit as that line
14719,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,beyond which he should not soar in quest of spurious applause: let him
14720,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"reflect that in proportion as he advances to the lamps, he recedes from"
14721,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,nature; that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional charm from
14722,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box, and that the bravura"
14723,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"of Mandane may produce effect, although the throat of her who warbles"
14724,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,it should not overhang the orchestra. The Jove of the modern critical
14725,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"Olympus, Lord Mayor of the theatric sky, has, _ex cathedrâ_, asserted"
14726,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,that a natural actor looks upon the audience part of the theatre as the
14727,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,third side of the chamber he inhabits. Surely of the third wall thus
14728,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"fancifully erected, our actors should by ridicule or reason be withheld"
14729,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,from knocking their heads against the stucco.
14730,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,
14731,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,Time forcibly reminds me that all things which have a limit must be
14732,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"brought to a conclusion. Let me, ere that conclusion arrives, recall"
14733,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,to your recollection that the pillars which rise on either side of
14734,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"me, blooming in varied antiquity, like two massy evergreens, had yet"
14735,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"slumbered in their native quarry, but for the ardent exertions of the"
14736,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,individual who called them into life: to his never-slumbering talents you
14737,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the Muses is calculated
14738,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"to afford. If, in defiance of chaotic malevolence, the destroyer of the"
14739,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"temple of Diana yet survives in the name of Erostratus, surely we may"
14740,JOHNSON'S GHOST.,"confidently predict, that the rebuilder of the temple of Apollo will"

15474,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","whose name for obvious reasons we forbear to mention, though we have had"

15478,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","glorious constitution of the only free, happy, and prosperous country"
15479,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",now left upon the face of the earth. From the valuable and authentic
15480,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","source above alluded to, we have learnt that a sanguinary plot has"
15481,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","been formed by some united Irishmen, combined with a gang of Luddites,"
15482,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",and a special committee sent over by the Pope at the instigation of

15485,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","highly-to-be-blamed stratagem, the gunpowder plot, which falls this year"
15486,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","on Thursday, the 5th of November. The whole is under the direction of"

15490,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","At a given signal a well-known O.P. was to cry out from the gallery,"
15491,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","""Nosey! Music!"" whereupon all the O.P.'s were to produce from their"

15499,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","constitution, all the heads of the N.P.'s were to be thrown at the"
15500,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","fiddlers, to prevent their appearing in evidence, or perhaps as a false"
15501,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",and illiberal insinuation that they have no heads of their own. All that

15508,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","a descendant of Guy Faux, assisted by Colonel Congreve, has"
15509,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","undertaken to blow up the house, when necessary, in so novel and"

15540,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","for more gunpowder than they want, they have parted with the surplus"

15542,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","Westminster, who has, with his own shovel, dug a large hole in"
