39,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,
40,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,
41,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,In some collection of old English Ballads there is an ancient ditty which
42,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,I am told bears some remote and distant resemblance to the following Epic
43,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,Poem. I beg to quote the emphatic language of my estimable friend (if he
44,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"will allow me to call him so), the Black Bear in Piccadilly, and to assure"
45,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"all to whom these presents may come, that ""_I_ am the original."" This"
46,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,affecting legend is given in the following pages precisely as I have
47,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"frequently heard it sung on Saturday nights, outside a house of general"
48,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,refreshment (familiarly termed a wine vaults) at Battle-bridge. The singer
49,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"is a young gentleman who can scarcely have numbered nineteen summers,"
50,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"and who before his last visit to the treadmill, where he was erroneously"
51,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,incarcerated for six months as a vagrant (being unfortunately mistaken
52,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"for another gentleman), had a very melodious and plaintive tone of voice,"
53,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"which, though it is now somewhat impaired by gruel and such a getting up"
54,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"stairs for so long a period, I hope shortly to find restored. I have taken"
55,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"down the words from his own mouth at different periods, and have been"
56,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"careful to preserve his pronunciation, together with the air to which he"
57,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"does so much justice. Of his execution of it, however, and the intense"
58,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,melancholy which he communicates to such passages of the song as are most
59,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"susceptible of such an expression, I am unfortunately unable to convey to"
60,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"the reader an adequate idea, though I may hint that the effect seems to me"
61,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,to be in part produced by the long and mournful drawl on the last two or
62,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,three words of each verse.
63,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,
64,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,I had intended to have dedicated my imperfect illustrations of this
65,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"beautiful Romance to the young gentleman in question. As I cannot find,"
66,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"however, that he is known among his friends by any other name than"
67,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"""The Tripe-skewer,"" which I cannot but consider as a _soubriquet_, or"
68,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,nick-name; and as I feel that it would be neither respectful nor proper
69,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"to address him publicly by that title, I have been compelled to forego the"
70,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"pleasure. If this should meet his eye, will he pardon my humble attempt to"
71,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,embellish with the pencil the sweet ideas to which he gives such feeling
72,THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.,"utterance? And will he believe me to remain his devoted admirer,"

298,NOTES.,desire; any foreign country would answer his purpose--all foreign countries
299,NOTES.,"were alike to him. He was a citizen of the world, and upon the world of"
300,NOTES.,"waters, sustained by the daring and reckless impulses of his heart, he"
301,NOTES.,"boldly launched. For anything, from pitch-and-toss upwards to manslaughter,"

319,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","assuming a fore-gone conclusion in the reader's mind, and adverting in a"
320,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","casual, careless way to a Turk unknown, as to an old acquaintance. ""_This_"
321,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","Turk he had--"" We have heard of no Turk before, and yet this familiar"

341,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","the solitude of her own apartments, or in contemplating the charms of"

345,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","of the Christian captive. Urged by pity and womanly sympathy, she repairs"
346,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]",to his prison to succour and console him. She supports his feeble and

365,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","of the real state of Lord Bateman's affections, and with no sordid or"
366,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","mercenary motives, she has enquired of that nobleman what are his means of"
367,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","subsistence, and whether _all_ Northumberland belongs to him. His Lordship"
368,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","has rejoined, with a noble regard for truth, that _half_ Northumberland is"
369,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","his, and that he will give it freely to the fair young lady who will"
370,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","release him from his dungeon. She, being thus assured of his regard and"
371,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","esteem, rejects all idea of pecuniary reward, and offers to be a party to a"
372,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","solemn wow--to be kept strong on both sides--that, if for seven years he"

391,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]",Nothing perhaps could be more ingeniously contrived to express the vastness
392,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]",of Lord Bateman's family mansion than this remarkable passage. The proud
393,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]","young porter had to thread courts, corridors, galleries, and staircases"

401,"CHILDE HAROLD, CANTO I.]",remarkable man. Even this proud young porter is checked in his impetuous
