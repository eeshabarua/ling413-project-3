167,AN ODE,"Ere the crescent of the last pale month of winter dwindle,"
168,AN ODE,"Shrink, and fall as falls a dead leaf on the dead month's tomb,"
169,AN ODE,Round the hills whose heights the first-born olive-blossom
170,AN ODE,"brightened,"
171,AN ODE,"Round the city brow-bound once with violets like a bride,"
172,AN ODE,Up from under earth again a light that long since lightened
173,AN ODE,"Breaks, whence all the world took comfort as all time takes"
174,AN ODE,pride.
175,AN ODE,"Pride have all men in their fathers that were free before them,"
176,AN ODE,In the warriors that begat us free-born pride have we:
177,AN ODE,"But the fathers of their spirits, how may men adore them,"
178,AN ODE,"With what rapture may we praise, who bade our souls be free?"
179,AN ODE,Sons of Athens born in spirit and truth are all born free men;
180,AN ODE,"Most of all, we, nurtured where the north wind holds his reign:"
181,AN ODE,"Children all we sea-folk of the Salaminian seamen,"
182,AN ODE,Sons of them that beat back Persia they that beat back Spain.
183,AN ODE,"Since the songs of Greece fell silent, none like ours have risen;"
184,AN ODE,"Since the sails of Greece fell slack, no ships have sailed like"
185,AN ODE,ours;
186,AN ODE,"How should we lament not, if her spirit sit in prison?"
187,AN ODE,"How should we rejoice not, if her wreaths renew their flowers?"
188,AN ODE,"All the world is sweeter, if the Athenian violet quicken:"
189,AN ODE,"All the world is brighter, if the Athenian sun return:"
190,AN ODE,"All things foul on earth wax fainter, by that sun's light stricken:"
191,AN ODE,"All ill growths are withered, where those fragrant flower-lights"
192,AN ODE,burn.
193,AN ODE,All the wandering waves of seas with all their warring waters
194,AN ODE,"Roll the record on for ever of the sea-fight there,"
195,AN ODE,"When the capes were battle's lists, and all the straits were"
196,AN ODE,"slaughter's,"
197,AN ODE,And the myriad Medes as foam-flakes on the scattering air.
198,AN ODE,"Ours the lightning was that cleared the north and lit the nations,"
199,AN ODE,But the light that gave the whole world light of old was she:
200,AN ODE,"Ours an age or twain, but hers are endless generations:"
201,AN ODE,"All the world is hers at heart, and most of all are we."
202,AN ODE,
203,AN ODE,"Ye that bear the name about you of her glory,            [_Ant. 1._"
204,AN ODE,"Men that wear the sign of Greeks upon you sealed,"
205,AN ODE,Yours is yet the choice to write yourselves in story
206,AN ODE,Sons of them that fought the Marathonian field.
207,AN ODE,"Slaves of no man were ye, said your warrior poet,"
208,AN ODE,Neither subject unto man as underlings:
209,AN ODE,"Yours is now the season here wherein to show it,"
210,AN ODE,If the seed ye be of them that knew not kings.
211,AN ODE,"If ye be not, swords nor words alike found brittle"
212,AN ODE,From the dust of death to raise you shall prevail:
213,AN ODE,"Subject swords and dead men's words may stead you little,"
214,AN ODE,If their old king-hating heart within you fail.
215,AN ODE,"If your spirit of old, and not your bonds, be broken,"
216,AN ODE,"If the kingless heart be molten in your breasts,"
217,AN ODE,"By what signs and wonders, by what word or token,"
218,AN ODE,Shall ye drive the vultures from your eagles' nests?
219,AN ODE,All the gains of tyrants Freedom counts for losses;
220,AN ODE,"Nought of all the work done holds she worth the work,"
221,AN ODE,When the slaves whose faith is set on crowns and crosses
222,AN ODE,Drive the Cossack bear against the tiger Turk.
223,AN ODE,"Neither cross nor crown nor crescent shall ye bow to,"
224,AN ODE,"Nought of Araby nor Jewry, priest nor king:"
225,AN ODE,"As your watchword was of old, so be it now too:"
226,AN ODE,"As from lips long stilled, from yours let healing spring."
227,AN ODE,"Through the fights of old, your battle-cry was healing,"
228,AN ODE,And the Saviour that ye called on was the Sun:
229,AN ODE,"Dawn by dawn behold in heaven your God, revealing"
230,AN ODE,Light from darkness as when Marathon was won.
231,AN ODE,"Gods were yours yet strange to Turk or Galilean,"
232,AN ODE,Light and Wisdom only then as gods adored:
233,AN ODE,"Pallas was your shield, your comforter was Pæan,"
234,AN ODE,From your bright world's navel spake the Sun your Lord.
235,AN ODE,
236,AN ODE,"Though the names be lost, and changed the signs of Light and Wisdom"
237,AN ODE,"be,                                                 [_Ep. 1._"
238,AN ODE,"By these only shall men conquer, by these only be set free:"
239,AN ODE,"When the whole world's eye was Athens, these were yours, and theirs"
240,AN ODE,were ye.
241,AN ODE,"Light was given you of your wisdom, light ye gave the world again:"
242,AN ODE,As the sun whose godhead lightened on her soul was Hellas then:
243,AN ODE,"Yea, the least of all her children as the chosen of other men."
244,AN ODE,"Change your hearts not with your garments, nor your faith with"
245,AN ODE,creeds that change:
246,AN ODE,"Truth was yours, the truth which time and chance transform not nor"
247,AN ODE,estrange:
248,AN ODE,Purer truth nor higher abides not in the reach of time's whole
249,AN ODE,range.
250,AN ODE,"Gods are they in all men's memories and for all time's periods,"
251,AN ODE,They that hurled the host back seaward which had scourged the sea
252,AN ODE,with rods:
253,AN ODE,"Gods for us are all your fathers, even the least of these as gods."
254,AN ODE,"In the dark of days the thought of them is with us, strong to save,"
255,AN ODE,"They that had no lord, and made the Great King lesser than a slave;"
256,AN ODE,"They that rolled all Asia back on Asia, broken like a wave."
257,AN ODE,"No man's men were they, no master's and no God's but these their"
258,AN ODE,own:
259,AN ODE,"Gods not loved in vain nor served amiss, nor all yet overthrown:"
260,AN ODE,"Love of country, Freedom, Wisdom, Light, and none save these alone."
261,AN ODE,"King by king came up against them, sire and son, and turned to"
262,AN ODE,flee:
263,AN ODE,"Host on host roared westward, mightier each than each, if more"
264,AN ODE,might be:
265,AN ODE,"Field to field made answer, clamorous like as wave to wave at sea."
266,AN ODE,"Strife to strife responded, loud as rocks to clangorous rocks"
267,AN ODE,respond
268,AN ODE,Where the deep rings wreck to seamen held in tempest's thrall and
269,AN ODE,"bond,"
270,AN ODE,Till when war's bright work was perfect peace as radiant rose
271,AN ODE,beyond:
272,AN ODE,"Peace made bright with fruit of battle, stronger made for storm"
273,AN ODE,"gone down,"
274,AN ODE,With the flower of song held heavenward for the violet of her crown
275,AN ODE,Woven about the fragrant forehead of the fostress maiden's town.
276,AN ODE,Gods arose alive on earth from under stroke of human hands:
277,AN ODE,"As the hands that wrought them, these are dead, and mixed with"
278,AN ODE,time's dead sands:
279,AN ODE,"But the godhead of supernal song, though these now stand not,"
280,AN ODE,stands.
281,AN ODE,"Pallas is not, Phoebus breathes no more in breathing brass or"
282,AN ODE,gold:
283,AN ODE,"Clytæmnestra towers, Cassandra wails, for ever: Time is bold,"
284,AN ODE,But nor heart nor hand hath he to unwrite the scriptures writ of
285,AN ODE,old.
286,AN ODE,"Dead the great chryselephantine God, as dew last evening shed:"
287,AN ODE,Dust of earth or foam of ocean is the symbol of his head:
288,AN ODE,Earth and ocean shall be shadows when Prometheus shall be dead.
289,AN ODE,
290,AN ODE,"Fame around her warriors living rang through Greece and lightened,"
291,AN ODE,[_Str. 2._
292,AN ODE,"Moving equal with their stature, stately with their strength:"
293,AN ODE,"Thebes and Lacedæmon at their breathing presence brightened,"
294,AN ODE,Sense or sound of them filled all the live land's breadth and
295,AN ODE,length.
296,AN ODE,"All the lesser tribes put on the pure Athenian fashion,"
297,AN ODE,One Hellenic heart was from the mountains to the sea:
298,AN ODE,"Sparta's bitter self grew sweet with high half-human passion,"
299,AN ODE,And her dry thorns flushed aflower in strait Thermopylæ.
300,AN ODE,"Fruitless yet the flowers had fallen, and all the deeds died"
301,AN ODE,"fruitless,"
302,AN ODE,"Save that tongues of after men, the children of her peace,"
303,AN ODE,"Took the tale up of her glories, transient else and rootless,"
304,AN ODE,And in ears and hearts of all men left the praise of Greece.
305,AN ODE,"Fair the war-time was when still, as beacon answering beacon,"
306,AN ODE,"Sea to land flashed fight, and thundered note of wrath or cheer;"
307,AN ODE,"But the strength of noonday night hath power to waste and weaken,"
308,AN ODE,Nor may light be passed from hand to hand of year to year
309,AN ODE,"If the dying deed be saved not, ere it die for ever,"
310,AN ODE,By the hands and lips of men more wise than years are strong;
311,AN ODE,"If the soul of man take heed not that the deed die never,"
312,AN ODE,"Clothed about with purple and gold of story, crowned with song."
313,AN ODE,"Still the burning heart of boy and man alike rejoices,"
314,AN ODE,Hearing words which made it seem of old for all who sang
315,AN ODE,That their heaven of heavens waxed happier when from free men's
316,AN ODE,voices
317,AN ODE,_Well-beloved Harmodius and Aristogeiton_ rang.
318,AN ODE,Never fell such fragrance from the flower-month's rose-red kirtle
319,AN ODE,As from chaplets on the bright friends' brows who slew their
320,AN ODE,lord:
321,AN ODE,Greener grew the leaf and balmier blew the flower of myrtle
322,AN ODE,When its blossom sheathed the sheer tyrannicidal sword.
323,AN ODE,None so glorious garland crowned the feast Panathenæan
324,AN ODE,As this wreath too frail to fetter fast the Cyprian dove:
325,AN ODE,None so fiery song sprang sunwards annual as the pæan
326,AN ODE,Praising perfect love of friends and perfect country's love.
327,AN ODE,
328,AN ODE,Higher than highest of all those heavens wherefrom the starry
329,AN ODE,[_Ant. 2._
330,AN ODE,"Song of Homer shone above the rolling fight,"
331,AN ODE,Gleams like spring's green bloom on boughs all gaunt and gnarry
332,AN ODE,"Soft live splendour as of flowers of foam in flight,"
333,AN ODE,Glows a glory of mild-winged maidens upward mounting
334,AN ODE,Sheer through air made shrill with strokes of smooth swift wings
335,AN ODE,"Round the rocks beyond foot's reach, past eyesight's counting,"
336,AN ODE,Up the cleft where iron wind of winter rings
337,AN ODE,"Round a God fast clenched in iron jaws of fetters,"
338,AN ODE,"Him who culled for man the fruitful flower of fire,"
339,AN ODE,"Bared the darkling scriptures writ in dazzling letters,"
340,AN ODE,"Taught the truth of dreams deceiving men's desire,"
341,AN ODE,Gave their water-wandering chariot-seats of ocean
342,AN ODE,"Wings, and bade the rage of war-steeds champ the rein,"
343,AN ODE,"Showed the symbols of the wild birds' wheeling motion,"
344,AN ODE,Waged for man's sake war with God and all his train.
345,AN ODE,"Earth, whose name was also Righteousness, a mother"
346,AN ODE,"Many-named and single-natured, gave him breath"
347,AN ODE,Whence God's wrath could wring but this word and none other--
348,AN ODE,"_He may smite me, yet he shall not do to death._"
349,AN ODE,Him the tongue that sang triumphant while tormented
350,AN ODE,Sang as loud the sevenfold storm that roared erewhile
351,AN ODE,Round the towers of Thebes till wrath might rest contented:
352,AN ODE,"Sang the flight from smooth soft-sanded banks of Nile,"
353,AN ODE,When like mateless doves that fly from snare or tether
354,AN ODE,"Came the suppliants landwards trembling as they trod,"
355,AN ODE,And the prayer took wing from all their tongues together--
356,AN ODE,"_King of kings, most holy of holies, blessed God._"
357,AN ODE,"But what mouth may chant again, what heart may know it,"
358,AN ODE,All the rapture that all hearts of men put on
359,AN ODE,When of Salamis the time-transcending poet
360,AN ODE,"Sang, whose hand had chased the Mede at Marathon?"
361,AN ODE,
362,AN ODE,Darker dawned the song with stormier wings above the watch-fire

364,AN ODE,Whence from Ida toward the hill of Hermes leapt the light that said
365,AN ODE,"Troy was fallen, a torch funereal for the king's triumphal head."
366,AN ODE,Dire indeed the birth of Leda's womb that had God's self to sire
367,AN ODE,"Bloomed, a flower of love that stung the soul with fangs that gnaw"
368,AN ODE,like fire:
369,AN ODE,But the twin-born human-fathered sister-flower bore fruit more
370,AN ODE,dire.
371,AN ODE,Scarce the cry that called on airy heaven and all swift winds on
372,AN ODE,"wing,"
373,AN ODE,"Wells of river-heads, and countless laugh of waves past reckoning,"
374,AN ODE,"Earth which brought forth all, and the orbèd sun that looks on"
375,AN ODE,"everything,"
376,AN ODE,Scarce that cry fills yet men's hearts more full of heart-devouring
377,AN ODE,dread
378,AN ODE,"Than the murderous word said mocking, how the child whose blood he"
379,AN ODE,shed
380,AN ODE,Might clasp fast and kiss her father where the dead salute the
381,AN ODE,dead.
382,AN ODE,"But the latter note of anguish from the lips that mocked her lord,"
383,AN ODE,When her son's hand bared against the breast that suckled him his
384,AN ODE,"sword,"
385,AN ODE,"How might man endure, O Æschylus, to hear it and record?"
386,AN ODE,"How might man endure, being mortal yet, O thou most highest, to"

388,AN ODE,"How record, being born of woman? Surely not thy Furies near,"
389,AN ODE,"Surely this beheld, this only, blasted hearts to death with fear."
390,AN ODE,"Not the hissing hair, nor flakes of blood that oozed from eyes of"
391,AN ODE,"fire,"
392,AN ODE,Nor the snort of savage sleep that snuffed the hungering heart's
393,AN ODE,desire
394,AN ODE,Where the hunted prey found hardly space and harbour to respire;
395,AN ODE,"She whose likeness called them--""Sleep ye, ho? what need of you"
396,AN ODE,"that sleep?"""
397,AN ODE,"(Ah, what need indeed, where she was, of all shapes that night may"

399,AN ODE,Hidden dark as death and deeper than men's dreams of hell are
400,AN ODE,deep?)
401,AN ODE,"She the murderess of her husband, she the huntress of her son,"
402,AN ODE,"More than ye was she, the shadow that no God withstands but one,"
403,AN ODE,Wisdom equal-eyed and stronger and more splendid than the sun.
404,AN ODE,"Yea, no God may stand betwixt us and the shadows of our deeds,"
405,AN ODE,"Nor the light of dreams that lighten darkness, nor the prayer that"
406,AN ODE,"pleads,"
407,AN ODE,"But the wisdom equal-souled with heaven, the light alone that"
408,AN ODE,leads.
409,AN ODE,Light whose law bids home those childless children of eternal

411,AN ODE,Soothed and reconciled and mastered and transmuted in men's sight
412,AN ODE,"Who behold their own souls, clothed with darkness once, now clothed"

416,AN ODE,"Lord of all the lords of song, whose head all heads bow down"
417,AN ODE,"before,"
418,AN ODE,Glory be to thee from all thy sons in all tongues evermore.
419,AN ODE,
420,AN ODE,Rose and vine and olive and deep ivy-bloom entwining     [_Str. 3._
421,AN ODE,Close the goodliest grave that e'er they closeliest might entwine
422,AN ODE,Keep the wind from wasting and the sun from too strong shining
423,AN ODE,Where the sound and light of sweetest songs still float and
424,AN ODE,shine.
425,AN ODE,"Here the music seems to illume the shade, the light to whisper"
426,AN ODE,"Song, the flowers to put not odours only forth, but words"
427,AN ODE,Sweeter far than fragrance: here the wandering wreaths twine
428,AN ODE,crisper
429,AN ODE,"Far, and louder far exults the note of all wild birds."

433,AN ODE,"Move and breathe as living things beheld round white Colonus,"
434,AN ODE,Audibler than melodies and visibler than flowers.
435,AN ODE,"Love, in fight unconquered, Love, with spoils of great men laden,"
436,AN ODE,Never sang so sweet from throat of woman or of dove:
437,AN ODE,"Love, whose bed by night is in the soft cheeks of a maiden,"
438,AN ODE,"And his march is over seas, and low roofs lack not Love;"
439,AN ODE,"Nor may one of all that live, ephemeral or eternal,"
440,AN ODE,Fly nor hide from Love; but whoso clasps him fast goes mad.
441,AN ODE,Never since the first-born year with flowers first-born grew vernal
442,AN ODE,Such a song made listening hearts of lovers glad or sad.
443,AN ODE,Never sounded note so radiant at the rayless portal
444,AN ODE,Opening wide on the all-concealing lowland of the dead
445,AN ODE,"As the music mingling, when her doomsday marked her mortal,"
446,AN ODE,"From her own and old men's voices round the bride's way shed,"
447,AN ODE,"Round the grave her bride-house, hewn for endless habitation,"
448,AN ODE,"Where, shut out from sunshine, with no bridegroom by, she slept;"
449,AN ODE,"But beloved of all her dark and fateful generation,"
450,AN ODE,But with all time's tears and praise besprinkled and bewept:
451,AN ODE,"Well-beloved of outcast father and self-slaughtered mother,"
452,AN ODE,"Born, yet unpolluted, of their blind incestuous bed;"
453,AN ODE,"Best-beloved of him for whose dead sake she died, her brother,"
454,AN ODE,Hallowing by her own life's gift her own born brother's head;
455,AN ODE,
456,AN ODE,Not with wine or oil nor any less libation               [_Ant. 3._
457,AN ODE,"Hallowed, nor made sweet with humbler perfume's breath;"
458,AN ODE,"Not with only these redeemed from desecration,"
459,AN ODE,But with blood and spirit of life poured forth to death;
460,AN ODE,"Blood unspotted, spirit unsullied, life devoted,"
461,AN ODE,"Sister too supreme to make the bride's hope good,"
462,AN ODE,"Daughter too divine as woman to be noted,"
463,AN ODE,Spouse of only death in mateless maidenhood.
464,AN ODE,"Yea, in her was all the prayer fulfilled, the saying"
465,AN ODE,All accomplished--_Would that fate would let me wear
466,AN ODE,"Hallowed innocence of words and all deeds, weighing"
467,AN ODE,"Well the laws thereof, begot on holier air,"
468,AN ODE,"Far on high sublimely stablished, whereof only"
469,AN ODE,Heaven is father; nor did birth of mortal mould
470,AN ODE,"Bring them forth, nor shall oblivion lull to lonely"
471,AN ODE,"Slumber. Great in these is God, and grows not old._"
472,AN ODE,Therefore even that inner darkness where she perished
473,AN ODE,"Surely seems as holy and lovely, seen aright,"
474,AN ODE,"As desirable and as dearly to be cherished,"
475,AN ODE,"As the haunt closed in with laurels from the light,"
476,AN ODE,"Deep inwound with olive and wild vine inwoven,"
477,AN ODE,"Where a godhead known and unknown makes men pale,"
478,AN ODE,But the darkness of the twilight noon is cloven
479,AN ODE,Still with shrill sweet moan of many a nightingale.
480,AN ODE,"Closer clustering there they make sweet noise together,"
481,AN ODE,"Where the fearful gods look gentler than our fear,"
482,AN ODE,And the grove thronged through with birds of holiest feather
483,AN ODE,Grows nor pale nor dumb with sense of dark things near.
484,AN ODE,"There her father, called upon with signs of wonder,"
485,AN ODE,"Passed with tenderest words away by ways unknown,"
486,AN ODE,"Not by sea-storm stricken down, nor touched of thunder,"
487,AN ODE,"To the dark benign deep underworld, alone."
488,AN ODE,
489,AN ODE,"Third of three that ruled in Athens, kings with sceptral song for"
490,AN ODE,"staff,                                              [_Ep. 3._"
491,AN ODE,Gladdest heart that God gave ever milk and wine of thought to
492,AN ODE,"quaff,"
493,AN ODE,Clearest eye that lightened ever to the broad lip's lordliest
494,AN ODE,"laugh,"
495,AN ODE,Praise be thine as theirs whose tragic brows the loftier leaf
496,AN ODE,engirds
497,AN ODE,"For the live and lyric lightning of thy honey-hearted words,"
498,AN ODE,Soft like sunny dewy wings of clouds and bright as crying of birds;
499,AN ODE,Full of all sweet rays and notes that make of earth and air and sea
500,AN ODE,"One great light and sound of laughter from one great God's heart,"
501,AN ODE,to be
502,AN ODE,Sign and semblance of the gladness of man's life where men breathe
503,AN ODE,free.
504,AN ODE,"With no Loxian sound obscure God uttered once, and all time heard,"
505,AN ODE,"All the soul of Athens, all the soul of England, in that word:"
506,AN ODE,Rome arose the second child of freedom: northward rose the third.
507,AN ODE,"Ere her Boreal dawn came kindling seas afoam and fields of snow,"
508,AN ODE,"Yet again, while Europe groaned and grovelled, shone like suns"
509,AN ODE,aglow
510,AN ODE,"Doria splendid over Genoa, Venice bright with Dandolo."
511,AN ODE,"Dead was Hellas, but Ausonia by the light of dead men's deeds"
512,AN ODE,"Rose and walked awhile alive, though mocked as whom the fen-fire"
513,AN ODE,leads
514,AN ODE,By the creed-wrought faith of faithless souls that mock their
515,AN ODE,doubts with creeds.
516,AN ODE,"Dead are these, and man is risen again: and haply now the three"
517,AN ODE,"Yet coequal and triune may stand in story, marked as free"
518,AN ODE,By the token of the washing of the waters of the sea.
519,AN ODE,Athens first of all earth's kindred many-tongued and many-kinned
520,AN ODE,"Had the sea to friend and comfort, and for kinsman had the wind:"
521,AN ODE,She that bare Columbus next: then she that made her spoil of Ind.
522,AN ODE,She that hears not what man's rage but only what the sea-wind
523,AN ODE,saith:
524,AN ODE,She that turned Spain's ships to cloud-wrack at the blasting of her
525,AN ODE,"breath,"
526,AN ODE,By her strengths of strong-souled children and of strong winds done
527,AN ODE,to death.
528,AN ODE,North and south the Great King's galleons went in Persian wise: and
529,AN ODE,here
530,AN ODE,"She, with Æschylean music on her lips that laughed back fear,"
531,AN ODE,In the face of Time's grey godhead shook the splendour of her
532,AN ODE,spear.
533,AN ODE,"Fair as Athens then with foot upon her foeman's front, and strong"
534,AN ODE,"Even as Athens for redemption of the world from sovereign wrong,"
535,AN ODE,Like as Athens crowned she stood before the sun with crowning song.
536,AN ODE,All the world is theirs with whom is freedom: first of all the
537,AN ODE,"free,"
538,AN ODE,Blest are they whom song has crowned and clothed with blessing:
539,AN ODE,"these as we,"
540,AN ODE,These alone have part in spirit with the sun that crowns the sea.

1064,I,
1065,I,"Queen, for whose house my fathers fought,"
1066,I,"With hopes that rose and fell,"
1067,I,"Red star of boyhood's fiery thought,"
1068,I,Farewell.
1069,I,
1070,I,"They gave their lives, and I, my queen,"
1071,I,"Have given you of my life,"
1072,I,Seeing your brave star burn high between
1073,I,Men's strife.
1074,I,
1075,I,The strife that lightened round their spears
1076,I,Long since fell still: so long
1077,I,Hardly may hope to last in years
1078,I,My song.
1079,I,
1080,I,But still through strife of time and thought
1081,I,Your light on me too fell:
1082,I,"Queen, in whose name we sang or fought,"
1083,I,Farewell.
1084,I,
1085,I,
1086,II,II
1087,II,
1088,II,There beats no heart on either border
1089,II,Wherethrough the north blasts blow
1090,II,But keeps your memory as a warder
1091,II,His beacon-fire aglow.
1092,II,
1093,II,Long since it fired with love and wonder
1094,II,"Mine, for whose April age"
1095,II,Blithe midsummer made banquet under
1096,II,The shade of Hermitage.
1097,II,
1098,II,"Soft sang the burn's blithe notes, that gather"
1099,II,Strength to ring true:
1100,II,And air and trees and sun and heather
1101,II,Remembered you.
1102,II,
1103,II,Old border ghosts of fight or fairy
1104,II,"Or love or teen,"
1105,II,"These they forgot, remembering Mary"
1106,II,The Queen.
1107,II,
1108,II,
1109,III,III
1110,III,
1111,III,Queen once of Scots and ever of ours
1112,III,Whose sires brought forth for you
1113,III,Their lives to strew your way like flowers.
1114,III,Adieu.
1115,III,
1116,III,Dead is full many a dead man's name
1117,III,Who died for you this long
1118,III,"Time past: shall this too fare the same,"
1119,III,My song?
1120,III,
1121,III,"But surely, though it die or live,"
1122,III,Your face was worth
1123,III,All that a man may think to give
1124,III,On earth.
1125,III,
1126,III,No darkness cast of years between
1127,III,Can darken you:
1128,III,Man's love will never bid my queen
1129,III,Adieu.
1130,III,
1131,III,
1132,IV,IV
1133,IV,
1134,IV,Love hangs like light about your name
1135,IV,As music round the shell:
1136,IV,No heart can take of you a tame
1137,IV,Farewell.
1138,IV,
1139,IV,"Yet, when your very face was seen,"
1140,IV,Ill gifts were yours for giving:
1141,IV,Love gat strange guerdons of my queen
1142,IV,When living.
1143,IV,
1144,IV,"O diamond heart unflawed and clear,"
1145,IV,The whole world's crowning jewel!
1146,IV,Was ever heart so deadly dear
1147,IV,So cruel?
1148,IV,
1149,IV,Yet none for you of all that bled
1150,IV,Grudged once one drop that fell:
1151,IV,Not one to life reluctant said
1152,IV,Farewell.
1153,IV,
1154,IV,
1155,V,V
1156,V,
1157,V,"Strange love they have given you, love disloyal,"
1158,V,"Who mock with praise your name,"
1159,V,To leave a head so rare and royal
1160,V,Too low for praise or blame.
1161,V,
1162,V,"You could not love nor hate, they tell us,"
1163,V,You had nor sense nor sting:
1164,V,"In God's name, then, what plague befell us"
1165,V,To fight for such a thing?
1166,V,
1167,V,"""Some faults the gods will give,"" to fetter"
1168,V,Man's highest intent:
1169,V,But surely you were something better
1170,V,Than innocent!
1171,V,
1172,V,No maid that strays with steps unwary
1173,V,"Through snares unseen,"
1174,V,"But one to live and die for; Mary,"
1175,V,The Queen.
1176,V,
1177,V,
1178,VI,VI
1179,VI,
1180,VI,"Forgive them all their praise, who blot"
1181,VI,Your fame with praise of you:
1182,VI,"Then love may say, and falter not,"
1183,VI,Adieu.
1184,VI,
1185,VI,Yet some you hardly would forgive
1186,VI,Who did you much less wrong
1187,VI,Once: but resentment should not live
1188,VI,Too long.
1189,VI,
1190,VI,"They never saw your lip's bright bow,"
1191,VI,"Your swordbright eyes,"
1192,VI,The bluest of heavenly things below
1193,VI,The skies.
1194,VI,
1195,VI,Clear eyes that love's self finds most like
1196,VI,"A swordblade's blue,"
1197,VI,"A swordblade's ever keen to strike,"
1198,VI,Adieu.
1199,VI,
1200,VI,
1201,VII,VII
1202,VII,
1203,VII,Though all things breathe or sound of fight
1204,VII,"That yet make up your spell,"
1205,VII,To bid you were to bid the light
1206,VII,Farewell.
1207,VII,
1208,VII,"Farewell the song says only, being"
1209,VII,A star whose race is run:
1210,VII,"Farewell the soul says never, seeing"
1211,VII,The sun.
1212,VII,
1213,VII,"Yet, wellnigh as with flash of tears,"
1214,VII,The song must say but so
1215,VII,That took your praise up twenty years
1216,VII,Ago.
1217,VII,
1218,VII,"More bright than stars or moons that vary,"
1219,VII,"Sun kindling heaven and hell,"
1220,VII,"Here, after all these years, Queen Mary,"
1221,VII,Farewell.

1230,HERSE,"A child some sweet months old,"
1231,HERSE,"Love, laying across our lips his finger, saith,"
1232,HERSE,"Smiling, with bated breath,"
1233,HERSE,"Hush! for the holiest thing that lives is here,"
1234,HERSE,And heaven's own heart how near!
1235,HERSE,"How dare we, that may gaze not on the sun,"
1236,HERSE,Gaze on this verier one?
1237,HERSE,"Heart, hold thy peace; eyes, be cast down for shame;"
1238,HERSE,"Lips, breathe not yet its name."
1239,HERSE,"In heaven they know what name to call it; we,"
1240,HERSE,"How should we know? For, see!"
1241,HERSE,The adorable sweet living marvellous
1242,HERSE,Strange light that lightens us
1243,HERSE,"Who gaze, desertless of such glorious grace,"
1244,HERSE,Full in a babe's warm face!
1245,HERSE,"All roses that the morning rears are nought,"
1246,HERSE,"All stars not worth a thought,"
1247,HERSE,"Set this one star against them, or suppose"
1248,HERSE,As rival this one rose.
1249,HERSE,What price could pay with earth's whole weight of gold
1250,HERSE,One least flushed roseleaf's fold
1251,HERSE,Of all this dimpling store of smiles that shine
1252,HERSE,"From each warm curve and line,"
1253,HERSE,"Each charm of flower-sweet flesh, to reillume"
1254,HERSE,The dappled rose-red bloom
1255,HERSE,"Of all its dainty body, honey-sweet"
1256,HERSE,"Clenched hands and curled-up feet,"
1257,HERSE,That on the roses of the dawn have trod
1258,HERSE,"As they came down from God,"
1259,HERSE,And keep the flush and colour that the sky
1260,HERSE,"Takes when the sun comes nigh,"
1261,HERSE,And keep the likeness of the smile their grace
1262,HERSE,Evoked on God's own face
1263,HERSE,"When, seeing this work of his most heavenly mood,"
1264,HERSE,He saw that it was good?
1265,HERSE,"For all its warm sweet body seems one smile,"
1266,HERSE,And mere men's love too vile
1267,HERSE,"To meet it, or with eyes that worship dims"
1268,HERSE,"Read o'er the little limbs,"
1269,HERSE,"Read all the book of all their beauties o'er,"
1270,HERSE,"Rejoice, revere, adore,"
1271,HERSE,"Bow down and worship each delight in turn,"

1273,HERSE,"But when our trembling kisses dare, yet dread,"
1274,HERSE,"Even to draw nigh its head,"
1275,HERSE,"And touch, and scarce with touch or breath surprise"
1276,HERSE,Its mild miraculous eyes
1277,HERSE,"Out of their viewless vision--O, what then,"
1278,HERSE,What may be said of men?
1279,HERSE,What speech may name a new-born child? what word
1280,HERSE,Earth ever spake or heard?
1281,HERSE,The best men's tongue that ever glory knew
1282,HERSE,Called that a drop of dew
1283,HERSE,Which from the breathing creature's kindly womb
1284,HERSE,Came forth in blameless bloom.
1285,HERSE,"We have no word, as had those men most high,"
1286,HERSE,To call a baby by.
1287,HERSE,"Rose, ruby, lily, pearl of stormless seas--"
1288,HERSE,"A better word than these,"
1289,HERSE,A better sign it was than flower or gem
1290,HERSE,That love revealed to them:
1291,HERSE,"They knew that whence comes light or quickening flame,"
1292,HERSE,"Thence only this thing came,"
1293,HERSE,And only might be likened of our love
1294,HERSE,"To somewhat born above,"
1295,HERSE,"Not even to sweetest things dropped else on earth,"
1296,HERSE,Only to dew's own birth.
1297,HERSE,"Nor doubt we but their sense was heavenly true,"
1298,HERSE,"Babe, when we gaze on you,"
1299,HERSE,A dew-drop out of heaven whose colours are
1300,HERSE,"More bright than sun or star,"
1301,HERSE,"As now, ere watching love dare fear or hope,"
1302,HERSE,"Lips, hands, and eyelids ope,"
1303,HERSE,And all your life is mixed with earthly leaven.
1304,HERSE,"O child, what news from heaven?"

1897,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1898,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1899,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Praise of the knights of old
1900,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"May sleep: their tale is told,"
1901,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And no man cares:
1902,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The praise which fires our lips is
1903,A CHILD'S BATTLES,A knight's whose fame eclipses
1904,A CHILD'S BATTLES,All of theirs.
1905,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1906,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The ruddiest light in heaven
1907,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Blazed as his birth-star seven
1908,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Long years ago:
1909,A CHILD'S BATTLES,All glory crown that old year
1910,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Which brought our stout small soldier
1911,A CHILD'S BATTLES,With the snow!
1912,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1913,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Each baby born has one
1914,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Star, for his friends a sun,"
1915,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The first of stars:
1916,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"And we, the more we scan it,"
1917,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"The more grow sure your planet,"
1918,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Child, was Mars."
1919,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1920,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"For each one flower, perchance,"
1921,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Blooms as his cognizance:
1922,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"The snowdrop chill,"
1923,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"The violet unbeholden,"
1924,A CHILD'S BATTLES,For some: for you the golden
1925,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Daffodil.
1926,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1927,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Erect, a fighting flower,"
1928,A CHILD'S BATTLES,It breasts the breeziest hour
1929,A CHILD'S BATTLES,That ever blew.
1930,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And bent or broke things brittle
1931,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Or frail, unlike a little"
1932,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Knight like you.
1933,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1934,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Its flower is firm and fresh
1935,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And stout like sturdiest flesh
1936,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Of children: all
1937,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The strenuous blast that parches
1938,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Spring hurts it not till March is
1939,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Near his fall.
1940,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1941,A CHILD'S BATTLES,If winds that prate and fret
1942,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Remark, rebuke, regret,"
1943,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Lament, or blame"
1944,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"The brave plant's martial passion,"
1945,A CHILD'S BATTLES,It keeps its own free fashion
1946,A CHILD'S BATTLES,All the same.
1947,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1948,A CHILD'S BATTLES,We that would fain seem wise
1949,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Assume grave mouths and eyes
1950,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Whose looks reprove
1951,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Too much delight in battle:
1952,A CHILD'S BATTLES,But your great heart our prattle
1953,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Cannot move.
1954,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1955,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"We say, small children should"
1956,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Be placid, mildly good"
1957,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And blandly meek:
1958,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Whereat the broad smile rushes
1959,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Full on your lips, and flushes"
1960,A CHILD'S BATTLES,All your cheek.
1961,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1962,A CHILD'S BATTLES,If all the stars that are
1963,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Laughed out, and every star"
1964,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Could here be heard,"
1965,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Such peals of golden laughter
1966,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"We should not hear, as after"
1967,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Such a word.
1968,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1969,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"For all the storm saith, still,"
1970,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Stout stands the daffodil:
1971,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"For all we say,"
1972,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Howe'er he look demurely,"
1973,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Our martialist will surely
1974,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Have his way.
1975,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1976,A CHILD'S BATTLES,We may not bind with bands
1977,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Those large and liberal hands,"
1978,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Nor stay from fight,"
1979,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Nor hold them back from giving:
1980,A CHILD'S BATTLES,No lean mean laws of living
1981,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Bind a knight.
1982,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1983,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And always here of old
1984,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Such gentle hearts and bold
1985,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Our land has bred:
1986,A CHILD'S BATTLES,How durst her eye rest else on
1987,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The glory shed from Nelson
1988,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Quick and dead?
1989,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1990,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Shame were it, if but one"
1991,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Such once were born her son,"
1992,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"That one to have borne,"
1993,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And brought him ne'er a brother:
1994,A CHILD'S BATTLES,His praise should bring his mother
1995,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Shame and scorn.
1996,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
1997,A CHILD'S BATTLES,A child high-souled as he
1998,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Whose manhood shook the sea
1999,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Smiles haply here:
2000,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"His face, where love lies basking,"
2001,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"With bright shut mouth seems asking,"
2002,A CHILD'S BATTLES,What is fear?
2003,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2004,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The sunshine-coloured fists
2005,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Beyond his dimpling wrists
2006,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Were never closed
2007,A CHILD'S BATTLES,For saving or for sparing--
2008,A CHILD'S BATTLES,For only deeds of daring
2009,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Predisposed.
2010,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2011,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Unclenched, the gracious hands"
2012,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Let slip their gifts like sands
2013,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Made rich with ore
2014,A CHILD'S BATTLES,That tongues of beggars ravish
2015,A CHILD'S BATTLES,From small stout hands so lavish
2016,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Of their store.
2017,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2018,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Sweet hardy kindly hands
2019,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Like these were his that stands
2020,A CHILD'S BATTLES,With heel on gorge
2021,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Seen trampling down the dragon
2022,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"On sign or flask or flagon,"
2023,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Sweet Saint George.
2024,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2025,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Some tournament, perchance,"
2026,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Of hands that couch no lance,"
2027,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Might mark this spot
2028,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Your lists, if here some pleasant"
2029,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Small Guenevere were present,"
2030,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Launcelot.
2031,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2032,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"My brave bright flower, you need"
2033,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"No foolish song, nor heed"
2034,A CHILD'S BATTLES,It more than spring
2035,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The sighs of winter stricken
2036,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Dead when your haunts requicken
2037,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Here, my king."
2038,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2039,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Yet O, how hardly may"
2040,A CHILD'S BATTLES,The wheels of singing stay
2041,A CHILD'S BATTLES,That whirl along
2042,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Bright paths whence echo raises
2043,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"The phantom of your praises,"
2044,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Child, my song!"
2045,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2046,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Beyond all other things
2047,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"That give my words fleet wings,"
2048,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Fleet wings and strong,"
2049,A CHILD'S BATTLES,You set their jesses ringing
2050,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Till hardly can I, singing,"
2051,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Stint my song.
2052,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2053,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"But all things better, friend,"
2054,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And worse must find an end:
2055,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"And, right or wrong,"
2056,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"'Tis time, lest rhyme should baffle,"
2057,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"I doubt, to put a snaffle"
2058,A CHILD'S BATTLES,On my song.
2059,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2060,A CHILD'S BATTLES,And never may your ear
2061,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Aught harsher hear or fear,"
2062,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Nor wolfish night
2063,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Nor dog-toothed winter snarling
2064,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Behind your steps, my darling"
2065,A CHILD'S BATTLES,My delight!
2066,A CHILD'S BATTLES,
2067,A CHILD'S BATTLES,For all the gifts you give
2068,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Me, dear, each day you live,"
2069,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Of thanks above
2070,A CHILD'S BATTLES,All thanks that could be spoken
2071,A CHILD'S BATTLES,"Take not my song in token,"
2072,A CHILD'S BATTLES,Take my love.

2082,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Gallant your life will be always, and all of it free."
2083,A CHILD'S FUTURE,
2084,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Free as the wind when the heart of the twilight is stirred
2085,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Eastward, and sounds from the springs of the sunrise are heard:"
2086,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Free--and we know not another as infinite word.
2087,A CHILD'S FUTURE,
2088,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Darkness or twilight or sunlight may compass us round,"
2089,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Hate may arise up against us, or hope may confound;"
2090,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Love may forsake us; yet may not the spirit be bound.
2091,A CHILD'S FUTURE,
2092,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Free in oppression of grief as in ardour of joy
2093,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Still may the soul be, and each to her strength as a toy:"
2094,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Free in the glance of the man as the smile of the boy.
2095,A CHILD'S FUTURE,
2096,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Freedom alone is the salt and the spirit that gives
2097,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Life, and without her is nothing that verily lives:"
2098,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Death cannot slay her: she laughs upon death and forgives.
2099,A CHILD'S FUTURE,
2100,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Brightest and hardiest of roses anear and afar
2101,A CHILD'S FUTURE,"Glitters the blithe little face of you, round as a star:"
2102,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Liberty bless you and keep you to be as you are.
2103,A CHILD'S FUTURE,
2104,A CHILD'S FUTURE,England and liberty bless you and keep you to be
2105,A CHILD'S FUTURE,Worthy the name of their child and the sight of their sea:

2113,SUNRISE,
2114,SUNRISE,If the wind and the sunlight of April and August had mingled the
2115,SUNRISE,past and hereafter
2116,SUNRISE,In a single adorable season whose life were a rapture of love and
2117,SUNRISE,"of laughter,"
2118,SUNRISE,And the blithest of singers were back with a song; if again from
2119,SUNRISE,"his tomb as from prison,"
2120,SUNRISE,If again from the night or the twilight of ages Aristophanes had
2121,SUNRISE,"arisen,"
2122,SUNRISE,With the gold-feathered wings of a bird that were also a god upon
2123,SUNRISE,"earth at his shoulders,"
2124,SUNRISE,"And the gold-flowing laugh of the manhood of old at his lips, for a"
2125,SUNRISE,"joy to beholders,"
2126,SUNRISE,He alone unrebuked of presumption were able to set to some adequate
2127,SUNRISE,measure
2128,SUNRISE,The delight of our eyes in the dawn that restores them the sun of
2129,SUNRISE,their sense and the pleasure.
2130,SUNRISE,"For the days of the darkness of spirit are over for all of us here,"
2131,SUNRISE,and the season
2132,SUNRISE,"When desire was a longing, and absence a thorn, and rejoicing a"
2133,SUNRISE,word without reason.
2134,SUNRISE,For the roof overhead of the pines is astir with delight as of
2135,SUNRISE,"jubilant voices,"
2136,SUNRISE,And the floor underfoot of the bracken and heather alive as a heart
2137,SUNRISE,that rejoices.
2138,SUNRISE,"For the house that was childless awhile, and the light of it"
2139,SUNRISE,"darkened, the pulse of it dwindled,"
2140,SUNRISE,"Rings radiant again with a child's bright feet, with the light of"
2141,SUNRISE,his face is rekindled.
2142,SUNRISE,"And the ways of the meadows that knew him, the sweep of the down"
2143,SUNRISE,"that the sky's belt closes,"
2144,SUNRISE,Grow gladder at heart than the soft wind made them whose feet were
2145,SUNRISE,"but fragrant with roses,"
2146,SUNRISE,"Though the fall of the year be upon us, who trusted in June and by"
2147,SUNRISE,"June were defrauded,"
2148,SUNRISE,And the summer that brought us not back the desire of our eyes be
2149,SUNRISE,gone hence unapplauded.
2150,SUNRISE,"For July came joyless among us, and August went out from us arid"
2151,SUNRISE,"and sterile,"
2152,SUNRISE,"And the hope of our hearts, as it seemed, was no more than a flower"
2153,SUNRISE,"that the seasons imperil,"
2154,SUNRISE,"And the joy of our hearts, as it seemed, than a thought which"
2155,SUNRISE,"regret had not heart to remember,"
2156,SUNRISE,"Till four dark months overpast were atoned for, and summer began in"
2157,SUNRISE,September.
2158,SUNRISE,"Hark, April again as a bird in the house with a child's voice"
2159,SUNRISE,hither and thither:
2160,SUNRISE,"See, May in the garden again with a child's face cheering the woods"
2161,SUNRISE,ere they wither.
2162,SUNRISE,"June laughs in the light of his eyes, and July on the sunbright"
2163,SUNRISE,"cheeks of him slumbers,"
2164,SUNRISE,And August glows in a smile more sweet than the cadence of
2165,SUNRISE,gold-mouthed numbers.
2166,SUNRISE,"In the morning the sight of him brightens the sun, and the noon"
2167,SUNRISE,"with delight in him flushes,"
2168,SUNRISE,And the silence of nightfall is music about him as soft as the
2169,SUNRISE,sleep that it hushes.
2170,SUNRISE,We awake with a sense of a sunrise that is not a gift of the
2171,SUNRISE,"sundawn's giving,"
2172,SUNRISE,And a voice that salutes us is sweeter than all sounds else in the
2173,SUNRISE,"world of the living,"
2174,SUNRISE,And a presence that warms us is brighter than all in the world of
2175,SUNRISE,"our visions beholden,"
2176,SUNRISE,Though the dreams of our sleep were as those that the light of a
2177,SUNRISE,world without grief makes golden.
2178,SUNRISE,For the best that the best of us ever devised as a likeness of
2179,SUNRISE,"heaven and its glory,"
2180,SUNRISE,"What was it of old, or what is it and will be for ever, in song or"
2181,SUNRISE,"in story,"
2182,SUNRISE,"Or in shape or in colour of carven or painted resemblance, adored"
2183,SUNRISE,"of all ages,"
2184,SUNRISE,But a vision recorded of children alive in the pictures of old or
2185,SUNRISE,the pages?
2186,SUNRISE,"Where children are not, heaven is not, and heaven if they come not"
2187,SUNRISE,again shall be never:
2188,SUNRISE,But the face and the voice of a child are assurance of heaven and
2189,SUNRISE,its promise for ever.
