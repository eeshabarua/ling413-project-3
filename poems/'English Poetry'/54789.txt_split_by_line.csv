151,_PROMETHEUS._,"From high Olympus and the ætherial courts,"
152,_PROMETHEUS._,Where mighty Zeus our angry king confirms
153,_PROMETHEUS._,"The Fates’ decrees and bends the wills of the gods,"
154,_PROMETHEUS._,I come: and on the earth step with glad foot.
155,_PROMETHEUS._,"This variegated ocean-floor of the air,"
156,_PROMETHEUS._,"The changeful circle of fair land, that lies"
157,_PROMETHEUS._,"Heaven’s dial, sisterly mirror of night and day:"
158,_PROMETHEUS._,"The wide o’er-wandered plain, this nether world"
159,_PROMETHEUS._,"My truant haunt is, when from jealous eyes"
160,_PROMETHEUS._,"I steal, for hither ’tis I steal, and here                        10"
161,_PROMETHEUS._,Unseen repair my joy: yet not unseen
162,_PROMETHEUS._,"Methinks, nor seen unguessed of him I seek."
163,_PROMETHEUS._,"Rather by swath or furrow, or where the path"
164,_PROMETHEUS._,"Is walled with corn I am found, by trellised vine"
165,_PROMETHEUS._,Or olive set in banks or orchard trim:
166,_PROMETHEUS._,"I watch all toil and tilth, farm, field and fold,"
167,_PROMETHEUS._,And taste the mortal joy; since not in heaven
168,_PROMETHEUS._,Among our easeful gods hath facile time
169,_PROMETHEUS._,"A touch so keen, to wake such love of life"
170,_PROMETHEUS._,"As stirs the frail and careful being, who here,                   20"
171,_PROMETHEUS._,"The king of sorrows, melancholy man,"
172,_PROMETHEUS._,"Bows at his labour, but in heart erect"
173,_PROMETHEUS._,"A god stands, nor for any gift of god"
174,_PROMETHEUS._,Would barter his immortal-hearted prime.
175,_PROMETHEUS._,"Could I but win this world from Zeus for mine,"
176,_PROMETHEUS._,"With not a god to vex my happy rule,"
177,_PROMETHEUS._,I would inhabit here and leave high heaven:
178,_PROMETHEUS._,"So much I love it and its race of men,"
179,_PROMETHEUS._,"Even as he hates them, hates both them, and me"
180,_PROMETHEUS._,"For loving what he hates, and would destroy me,"
181,_PROMETHEUS._,"Outcast in the scorn of all his cringing crew,"
182,_PROMETHEUS._,For daring but to save what he would slay:
183,_PROMETHEUS._,And me must first destroy. Thus he denieth
184,_PROMETHEUS._,"My heart’s wish, thus my counsel sets at naught,"
185,_PROMETHEUS._,"Which him saved once, when all at stake he stood"
186,_PROMETHEUS._,Uprisen in rebellion to overthrow
187,_PROMETHEUS._,"The elderseated Titans, for I that day"
188,_PROMETHEUS._,Gave him the counsels which his foes despised.
189,_PROMETHEUS._,"Unhappy they, who had still their blissful seats"
190,_PROMETHEUS._,"Preserved and their Olympian majesty,                             40"
191,_PROMETHEUS._,"Had they been one with me. Alas, my kin!"
192,_PROMETHEUS._,"But he, when he had taken the throne and chained"
193,_PROMETHEUS._,"His foes in wasteful Tartarus, said no more"
194,_PROMETHEUS._,Where is Prometheus our wise counsellor?
195,_PROMETHEUS._,"What saith Prometheus? tell us, O Prometheus,"
196,_PROMETHEUS._,What Fate requires! but waxing confident
197,_PROMETHEUS._,"And wanton, as a youth first tasting power,"
198,_PROMETHEUS._,"He wrecked the timeless monuments of heaven,"
199,_PROMETHEUS._,"The witness of the wisdom of the gods,"
200,_PROMETHEUS._,"And making all about him new, beyond                              50"
201,_PROMETHEUS._,"Determined to destroy the race of men,"
202,_PROMETHEUS._,And that create afresh or else have none.
203,_PROMETHEUS._,"Then his vain mind imagined a device,"
204,_PROMETHEUS._,And at his bidding all the opposèd winds
205,_PROMETHEUS._,"Blew, and the scattered clouds and furlèd snows,"
206,_PROMETHEUS._,"From every part of heaven together flying,"
207,_PROMETHEUS._,He with brute hands in huge disorder heaped:
208,_PROMETHEUS._,They with the winds’ weight and his angry breath
209,_PROMETHEUS._,"Were thawed: in cataracts they fell, and earth"
210,_PROMETHEUS._,"In darkness deep and whelmèd tempest lay,                         60"
211,_PROMETHEUS._,Drowned’neath the waters. Yet on the mountain-tops
212,_PROMETHEUS._,"Some few escaped, and some, thus warned by me,"
213,_PROMETHEUS._,Made shift to live in vessels which outrode
214,_PROMETHEUS._,The season and the fury of the flood.
215,_PROMETHEUS._,And when his rain was spent and from clear skies
216,_PROMETHEUS._,"Zeus looking down upon the watery world,"
217,_PROMETHEUS._,"Beheld these few, the remnant of mankind,"
218,_PROMETHEUS._,Who yet stood up and breathed; he next withdrew
219,_PROMETHEUS._,"The seeds of fire, that else had still lain hid"
220,_PROMETHEUS._,In withered branch and the blue flakes of flint                   70
221,_PROMETHEUS._,"For man to exact and use, but these withdrawn,"
222,_PROMETHEUS._,Man with the brutes degraded would be man
223,_PROMETHEUS._,No more; and so the tyrant was content.
224,_PROMETHEUS._,"But I, despised again, again upheld"
225,_PROMETHEUS._,"The weak, and pitying them sent sweet Hope,"
226,_PROMETHEUS._,"Bearer of dreams, enchantress fond and kind,"
227,_PROMETHEUS._,From heaven descending on the unhindered rays
228,_PROMETHEUS._,"Of every star, to cheer with visions fair"
229,_PROMETHEUS._,Their unamending pains. And now this day
230,_PROMETHEUS._,Behold I come bearing the seal of all                             80
231,_PROMETHEUS._,Which Hope had promised: for within this reed
232,_PROMETHEUS._,"A prisoner I bring them stolen from heaven,"
233,_PROMETHEUS._,"The flash of mastering fire, and it have borne"
234,_PROMETHEUS._,"So swift to earth, that when yon noontide sun"
235,_PROMETHEUS._,"Rose from the sea at morning I was by,"
236,_PROMETHEUS._,And unperceived of Hêlios plunged the point
237,_PROMETHEUS._,"I’ the burning axle, and withdrew a tongue"
238,_PROMETHEUS._,"Of breathing flame, which lives to leap on earth"
239,_PROMETHEUS._,For man the father of all fire to come.
240,_PROMETHEUS._,And hither have I brought it even to Argos                      90
241,_PROMETHEUS._,"Unto king Inachus, him having chosen"
242,_PROMETHEUS._,Above all mortals to receive my gift:
243,_PROMETHEUS._,"For he is hopeful, careful, wise, and brave."
244,_PROMETHEUS._,"He first, when first the floods left bare the land,"
245,_PROMETHEUS._,"Grew warm with enterprise, and gathered men"
246,_PROMETHEUS._,"Together, and disposed their various tasks"
247,_PROMETHEUS._,For common weal combined; for soon were seen
248,_PROMETHEUS._,"The long straight channels dwindling on the plain,"
249,_PROMETHEUS._,Which slow from stagnant pool and wide morass
250,_PROMETHEUS._,The pestilent waters to the rivers bore:                         100
251,_PROMETHEUS._,Then in the ruined dwellings and old tombs
252,_PROMETHEUS._,"He dug, unbedding from the wormèd ooze"
253,_PROMETHEUS._,Vessels and tools of trade and husbandry;
254,_PROMETHEUS._,"Wherewith, all seasonable works restored,"
255,_PROMETHEUS._,"Oil made he and wine anew, and taught mankind"
256,_PROMETHEUS._,"To live not brutally though without fire,"
257,_PROMETHEUS._,"Tending their flocks and herds and weaving wool,"
258,_PROMETHEUS._,"Living on fruit and milk and shepherds’ fare,"
259,_PROMETHEUS._,"Till time should bring back flame to smithy and hearth,"
260,_PROMETHEUS._,"Or Zeus relent. Now at these gates I stand,                      110"
261,_PROMETHEUS._,"At this mid hour, when Inachus comes forth"
262,_PROMETHEUS._,To offer sacrifice unto his foe.
263,_PROMETHEUS._,For never hath his faithful zeal forborne
264,_PROMETHEUS._,"To pay the power, though hard, that rules the world"
265,_PROMETHEUS._,The smokeless sacrifice; which first today
266,_PROMETHEUS._,"Shall smoke, and rise at heaven in flame to brave"
267,_PROMETHEUS._,The baffled god. See here a servant bears
268,_PROMETHEUS._,For the cold altar ceremonial wood:
269,_PROMETHEUS._,My shepherd’s cloak will serve me for disguise.
270,_PROMETHEUS._,
271,_SERVANT._,_SERVANT._
272,_SERVANT._,
273,_SERVANT._,With much toil have I hewn these sapless logs.                   120
274,_SERVANT._,
275,_SERVANT._,"_Pr._ But toil brings health, and health is happiness."
276,_SERVANT._,
277,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ Here’s one I know not--nay, how came he here"
278,_SERVANT._,"Unseen by me? I pray thee, stranger, tell me"
279,_SERVANT._,What would’st thou at the house of Inachus?
280,_SERVANT._,
281,_SERVANT._,"_Pr._ Intruders, friend, and travellers have glib tongues,"
282,_SERVANT._,Silence will question such.
283,_SERVANT._,
284,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ If ’tis a message,"
285,_SERVANT._,To-day is not thy day--who sent thee hither?
286,_SERVANT._,
287,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ The business of my leisure was well guessed:
288,_SERVANT._,But he that sent me hither is I that come.
289,_SERVANT._,
290,_SERVANT._,_Serv._ I smell the matter--thou would’st serve the house?       130
291,_SERVANT._,
292,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ ’Twas for that very cause I fled my own.
293,_SERVANT._,
294,_SERVANT._,_Serv._ From cruelty or fear of punishment?
295,_SERVANT._,
296,_SERVANT._,"_Pr._ Cruel was my master, for he slew his father."
297,_SERVANT._,His punishments thou speakest of are crimes.
298,_SERVANT._,
299,_SERVANT._,_Serv._ Thou dost well flying one that slew his father.
300,_SERVANT._,
301,_SERVANT._,"_Pr._ Thy lord, they say, is kind."
302,_SERVANT._,
303,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ Well, thou wilt see."
304,_SERVANT._,"Thou may’st at once begin--come, give a hand."
305,_SERVANT._,
306,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ A day of freedom is a day of pleasure;
307,_SERVANT._,"And what thou doest have I never done,"
308,_SERVANT._,And understanding not might mar thy work.                        140
309,_SERVANT._,
310,_SERVANT._,_Serv._ Ay true--there is a right way and a wrong
311,_SERVANT._,In laying wood.
312,_SERVANT._,
313,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ Then let me see thee lay it:
314,_SERVANT._,The sight of a skill’d hand will teach an art.
315,_SERVANT._,
316,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ Thou seest this faggot which I now unbind,"
317,_SERVANT._,How it is packed within.
318,_SERVANT._,
319,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ I see the cones
320,_SERVANT._,"And needles of the fir, which by the wind"
321,_SERVANT._,In melancholy places ceaselessly
322,_SERVANT._,Sighing are strewn upon the tufted floor.
323,_SERVANT._,
324,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ These took I from a sheltered bank, whereon"
325,_SERVANT._,The sun looks down at noon; for there is need
326,_SERVANT._,The things be dry. These first I spread; and then
327,_SERVANT._,Small sticks that snap i’ the hand.
328,_SERVANT._,
329,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ Such are enough
330,_SERVANT._,"To burden the slow flight of labouring rooks,"
331,_SERVANT._,When on the leafless tree-tops in young March
332,_SERVANT._,Their glossy herds assembling soothe the air                     155
333,_SERVANT._,With cries of solemn joy and cawings loud.
334,_SERVANT._,And such the long-necked herons will bear to mend
335,_SERVANT._,"Their airy platform, when the loving spring"
336,_SERVANT._,Bids them take thought for their expected young.
337,_SERVANT._,
338,_SERVANT._,_Serv._ See even so I cross them and cross them so:
339,_SERVANT._,Larger and by degrees a steady stack                             161
340,_SERVANT._,"Have built, whereon the heaviest logs may lie:"
341,_SERVANT._,And all of sun-dried wood: and now ’tis done.
342,_SERVANT._,
343,_SERVANT._,"_Pr._ And now ’tis done, what means it now ’tis done?"
344,_SERVANT._,
345,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ Well, thus ’tis rightly done: but why ’tis so"
346,_SERVANT._,"I cannot tell, nor any man here knows;"
347,_SERVANT._,"Save that our master when he sacrificeth,"
348,_SERVANT._,"As thou wilt hear anon, speaketh of fire;"
349,_SERVANT._,And fire he saith is good for gods and men;
350,_SERVANT._,And the gods have it and men have it not:                        170
351,_SERVANT._,And then he prays the gods to send us fire;
352,_SERVANT._,"And we, against they send it, must have wood"
353,_SERVANT._,Laid ready thus as I have shewn thee here.
354,_SERVANT._,
355,_SERVANT._,_Pr._ To-day he sacrificeth?
356,_SERVANT._,
357,_SERVANT._,"_Serv._ Ay, this noon."
358,_SERVANT._,Hark! hear’st thou not? they come. The solemn flutes
359,_SERVANT._,Warn us away; we must not here be seen
360,_SERVANT._,"In these our soilèd habits, yet may stand"
361,_SERVANT._,Where we may hear and see and not be seen.

386,_CHORUS._,And the changeful moon by night:
387,_CHORUS._,Attending with tireless ears
388,_CHORUS._,"To the song of adoring love,"
389,_CHORUS._,With which the separate spheres
390,_CHORUS._,Are voicèd that turn above:
391,_CHORUS._,And all that is hidden under
392,_CHORUS._,The clouds thy footing has furl’d                                200
393,_CHORUS._,"Fears the hand that holdeth the thunder,"
394,_CHORUS._,The eye that looks on the world.
395,_CHORUS._,
396,_CHORUS._,_Semichorus of youths._
397,_CHORUS._,
398,_CHORUS._,Of all the isles of the sea
399,_CHORUS._,Is Crete most famed in story:
400,_CHORUS._,Above all mountains famous to me
401,_CHORUS._,Is Ida and crowned with glory.
402,_CHORUS._,There guarded of Heaven and Earth
403,_CHORUS._,Came Rhea at fall of night
404,_CHORUS._,To hide a wondrous birth
405,_CHORUS._,From the Sire’s unfathering sight.                               210
406,_CHORUS._,The halls of Cronos rang
407,_CHORUS._,"With omens of coming ill,"
408,_CHORUS._,And the mad Curêtes danced and sang
409,_CHORUS._,Adown the slopes of the hill.
410,_CHORUS._,
411,_CHORUS._,Then all the peaks of Gnossus kindled red
412,_CHORUS._,"Beckoning afar unto the sinking sun,"
413,_CHORUS._,"He thro’ the vaporous west plunged to his bed,"
414,_CHORUS._,"Sunk, and the day was done."
415,_CHORUS._,"But they, though he was fled,"
416,_CHORUS._,"Such light still held, as oft                                    220"
417,_CHORUS._,"Hanging in air aloft,"
418,_CHORUS._,At eve from shadowed ship
419,_CHORUS._,The Egyptian sailor sees:
420,_CHORUS._,Or like the twofold tip
421,_CHORUS._,That o’er the topmost trees
422,_CHORUS._,"Flares on Parnassus, and the Theban dames"
423,_CHORUS._,Quake at the ghostly flames.
424,_CHORUS._,
425,_CHORUS._,Then friendly night arose
426,_CHORUS._,"To succour Earth, and spread"
427,_CHORUS._,Her mantle o’er the snows                                        230
428,_CHORUS._,And quenched their rosy red;
429,_CHORUS._,But in the east upsprings
430,_CHORUS._,"Another light on them,"
431,_CHORUS._,Selêné with white wings
432,_CHORUS._,And hueless diadem.
433,_CHORUS._,Little could she befriend
434,_CHORUS._,"Her father’s house and state,"
435,_CHORUS._,Nor her weak beams defend
436,_CHORUS._,Hypérion from his fate.
437,_CHORUS._,"Only where’er she shines,                                        240"
438,_CHORUS._,"In terror looking forth,"
439,_CHORUS._,She sees the wailing pines
440,_CHORUS._,Stoop to the bitter North:
441,_CHORUS._,Or searching twice or thrice
442,_CHORUS._,"Along the rocky walls,"
443,_CHORUS._,She marks the columned ice
444,_CHORUS._,Of frozen waterfalls:
445,_CHORUS._,But still the darkened cave
446,_CHORUS._,"Grew darker as she shone,"
447,_CHORUS._,Wherein was Rhea gone                                            250
448,_CHORUS._,Her child to bear and save.
449,_CHORUS._,
450,_CHORUS._,_[They dance._
451,_CHORUS._,
452,_CHORUS._,"Then danced the Dactyls and Curêtes wild,"
453,_CHORUS._,And drowned with yells the cries of mother and child;
454,_CHORUS._,Big-armed Damnámeneus gan prance and shout:
455,_CHORUS._,And burly Acmon struck the echoes out:
456,_CHORUS._,And Kermis leaped and howled: and Titias pranced:
457,_CHORUS._,And broad Cyllenus tore the air and danced:
458,_CHORUS._,While deep within the shadowed cave at rest
459,_CHORUS._,"Lay Rhea, with her babe upon her breast."
460,_CHORUS._,
461,_INACHUS._,_INACHUS._
462,_INACHUS._,
463,_INACHUS._,If any here there be whose impure hands                          260
464,_INACHUS._,"Among pure hands, or guilty heart among"
465,_INACHUS._,"Our guiltless hearts be stained with blood or wrong,"
466,_INACHUS._,Let him depart!
467,_INACHUS._,If there be any here in whom high Zeus
468,_INACHUS._,"Seeing impiety might turn away,"
469,_INACHUS._,Now from our sacrifice and from his sin
470,_INACHUS._,Let him depart!
471,_INACHUS._,
472,_INACHUS._,_Semichorus of maidens._
473,_INACHUS._,
474,_INACHUS._,I have chosen to praise
475,_INACHUS._,"Hêra the wife, and bring"
476,_INACHUS._,A hymn for the feast on marriage days
477,_INACHUS._,To the wife of the gods’ king.                               271
478,_INACHUS._,How on her festival
479,_INACHUS._,"The gods had loving strife,"
480,_INACHUS._,Which should give of them all
481,_INACHUS._,The fairest gift to the wife.
482,_INACHUS._,"But Earth said, Fair to see"
483,_INACHUS._,"Is mine and yields to none,"
484,_INACHUS._,"I have grown for her joy a sacred tree,"
485,_INACHUS._,With apples of gold thereon.
486,_INACHUS._,
487,_INACHUS._,"Then Hêra, when she heard what Earth had given,"
488,_INACHUS._,"Smiled for her joy, and longed and came to see:"
489,_INACHUS._,"On dovewings flying from the height of heaven,"
490,_INACHUS._,Down to the golden tree:
491,_INACHUS._,As tired birds at even
492,_INACHUS._,Come flying straight to house                                    285
493,_INACHUS._,On their accustomed boughs.
494,_INACHUS._,"’Twas where, on tortured hands"
495,_INACHUS._,"Bearing the mighty pole,"
496,_INACHUS._,Devoted Atlas stands:
497,_INACHUS._,And round his bowed head roll
498,_INACHUS._,"Day-light and night, and stars unmingled dance,"
499,_INACHUS._,Nor can he raise his glance.
500,_INACHUS._,
501,_INACHUS._,She saw the rocky coast
502,_INACHUS._,Whereon the azured waves
503,_INACHUS._,"Are laced in foam, or lost"
504,_INACHUS._,In water-lighted caves;
505,_INACHUS._,"The olive island where,"
506,_INACHUS._,Amid the purple seas
507,_INACHUS._,Night unto Darkness bare
508,_INACHUS._,The four Hesperides:                                         300
509,_INACHUS._,And came into the shade
510,_INACHUS._,"Of Atlas, where she found"
511,_INACHUS._,The garden Earth had made
512,_INACHUS._,And fenced with groves around.
513,_INACHUS._,And in the midst it grew
514,_INACHUS._,"Alone, the priceless stem,"
515,_INACHUS._,"As careful, clear and true"
516,_INACHUS._,As graving on a gem.
517,_INACHUS._,Nature had kissèd Art
518,_INACHUS._,And borne a child to stir                                    310
519,_INACHUS._,With jealousy the heart
520,_INACHUS._,Of heaven’s Artificer.
521,_INACHUS._,From crown to swelling root
522,_INACHUS._,"It mocked the goddess’ praise,"
523,_INACHUS._,The green enamelled sprays
524,_INACHUS._,The emblazoned golden fruit.
525,_INACHUS._,
526,_INACHUS._,[_They dance._
527,_INACHUS._,
528,_INACHUS._,"And ’neath the tree, with hair and zone unbound,"
529,_INACHUS._,"The fair Hesperides aye danced around,"
530,_INACHUS._,"And Ægle danced and sang ‘O welcome, Queen!’"
531,_INACHUS._,And Erytheia sang ‘The tree is green!’                           320
532,_INACHUS._,And Hestia danced and sang ‘The fruit is gold!’
533,_INACHUS._,"And Arethusa sang ‘Fair Queen, behold!’"
534,_INACHUS._,"And all joined hands and danced about the tree,"
535,_INACHUS._,"And sang ‘O Queen, we dance and sing for thee!’"
536,_INACHUS._,
537,_INACHUS._,_In._ If there be any here who has complaint
538,_INACHUS._,"Against our rule or claim or supplication,"
539,_INACHUS._,"Now in the name of Zeus let it appear,"
540,_INACHUS._,Now let him speak!
541,_INACHUS._,
542,_INACHUS._,_Prometheus reenters._
543,_INACHUS._,
544,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ All hail, most worthy king, such claim have I."
545,_INACHUS._,
546,_INACHUS._,"_In._ May grace be with thee, stranger; speak thy mind.          330"
547,_INACHUS._,
548,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ To Argos, king of Argos, at thy house"
549,_INACHUS._,"I bring long journeying to an end this hour,"
550,_INACHUS._,Bearing no idle message for thine ears.
551,_INACHUS._,"For know that far thy fame has reached, and men"
552,_INACHUS._,That ne’er have seen thee tell that thou art set
553,_INACHUS._,"Upon the throne of virtue, that good-will"
554,_INACHUS._,"And love thy servants are, that in thy land"
555,_INACHUS._,"Joy, honour, trust and modesty abide"
556,_INACHUS._,"And drink the air of peace, that kings must see"
557,_INACHUS._,"Thy city, would they know their peoples’ good                    340"
558,_INACHUS._,And stablish them therein by wholesome laws.
559,_INACHUS._,"But one thing mars the tale, for o’er thy lands"
560,_INACHUS._,"Travelling I have not seen from morn till eve,"
561,_INACHUS._,"Either from house or farm or labourer’s cot,"
562,_INACHUS._,"In any village, nor this town of Argos"
563,_INACHUS._,"A blue-wreathed smoke arise: the hearths are cold,"
564,_INACHUS._,This altar cold: I see the wood and cakes
565,_INACHUS._,"Unbaken--O king, where is the fire?"
566,_INACHUS._,
567,_INACHUS._,"_In._ If hither, stranger, thou wert come to find"
568,_INACHUS._,"That which thou findest wanting, join with us"
569,_INACHUS._,"Now in our sacrifice, take food within,                          351"
570,_INACHUS._,And having learnt our simple way of life
571,_INACHUS._,Return unto thy country whence thou camest.
572,_INACHUS._,"But hast thou skill or knowledge of this thing,"
573,_INACHUS._,"How best it may be sought, or by what means"
574,_INACHUS._,"Hope to be reached, O speak! I wait to hear."
575,_INACHUS._,
576,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ There is, O king, fire on the earth this day."
577,_INACHUS._,
578,_INACHUS._,_In._ On earth there is fire thou sayest!
579,_INACHUS._,
580,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ There is fire.
581,_INACHUS._,
582,_INACHUS._,_In._ On earth this day!
583,_INACHUS._,
584,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ There is fire on earth this day.
585,_INACHUS._,
586,_INACHUS._,"_In._ This is a sacred place, a solemn hour,"
587,_INACHUS._,"Thy speech is earnest: yet even if thou speak truth,"
588,_INACHUS._,"O welcome messenger of happy tidings,"
589,_INACHUS._,"And though I hear aright, yet to believe"
590,_INACHUS._,Is hard: thou canst not know what words thou speakest
591,_INACHUS._,Into what ears: they never heard before                          365
592,_INACHUS._,"This sound but in old tales of happier times,"
593,_INACHUS._,In sighs of prayer and faint unhearted hope:
594,_INACHUS._,"Maybe they heard not rightly, speak again!"
595,_INACHUS._,
596,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ There is, O king, fire on the earth this day."
597,_INACHUS._,
598,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Yes, yes, again. Now let sweet Music blab"
599,_INACHUS._,Her secret and give o’er; here is a trumpet                      371
600,_INACHUS._,That mocks her method. Yet ’tis but the word.
601,_INACHUS._,Maybe thy fire is not the fire I seek;
602,_INACHUS._,"Maybe though thou didst see it, now ’tis quenched,"
603,_INACHUS._,Or guarded out of reach: speak yet again
604,_INACHUS._,And swear by heaven’s truth is there fire or no;
605,_INACHUS._,"And if there be, what means may make it mine."
606,_INACHUS._,
607,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ There is, O king, fire on the earth this day:"
608,_INACHUS._,But not as thou dost seek it to be found.
609,_INACHUS._,
610,_INACHUS._,_In._ How seeking wrongly shall I seek aright?
611,_INACHUS._,
612,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Thou prayest here to Zeus, and him thou callest            381"
613,_INACHUS._,"Almighty, knowing he could grant thy prayer:"
614,_INACHUS._,"That if ’twere but his will, the journeying sun"
615,_INACHUS._,Might drop a spark into thine outstretched hand:
616,_INACHUS._,That at his breath the splashing mountain brooks
617,_INACHUS._,"That fall from Orneæ, and cold Lernè’s pool"
618,_INACHUS._,"Would change their element, and their chill streams"
619,_INACHUS._,Bend in their burning banks a molten flood:
620,_INACHUS._,That at his word so many messengers
621,_INACHUS._,"Would bring thee fire from heaven, that not a hearth"
622,_INACHUS._,In all thy land but straight would have a god                    391
623,_INACHUS._,"To kneel and fan the flame: and yet to him,"
624,_INACHUS._,It is to him thou prayest.
625,_INACHUS._,
626,_INACHUS._,_In._ Therefore to him.
627,_INACHUS._,
628,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Is this thy wisdom, king, to sow thy seed"
629,_INACHUS._,Year after year in this unsprouting soil?
630,_INACHUS._,Hast thou not proved and found the will of Zeus
631,_INACHUS._,A barren rock for man with prayer to plough?
632,_INACHUS._,
633,_INACHUS._,_In._ His anger be averted! we judge not god
634,_INACHUS._,"Evil, because our wishes please him not."
635,_INACHUS._,Oft our shortsighted prayers to heaven ascending
636,_INACHUS._,"Ask there our ruin, and are then denied                          401"
637,_INACHUS._,"In kindness above granting: were’t not so,"
638,_INACHUS._,Scarce could we pray for fear to pluck our doom
639,_INACHUS._,Out of the merciful withholding hands.
640,_INACHUS._,
641,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ Why then provokest thou such great goodwill
642,_INACHUS._,In long denial and kind silence shown?
643,_INACHUS._,
644,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Fie, fie! Thou lackest piety: the god’s denial"
645,_INACHUS._,"Being nought but kindness, there is hope that he"
646,_INACHUS._,Will make that good which is not:--or if indeed
647,_INACHUS._,"Good be withheld in punishment, ’tis well"
648,_INACHUS._,Still to seek on and pray that god relent.                       411
649,_INACHUS._,
650,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ O Sire of Argos, Zeus will not relent."
651,_INACHUS._,
652,_INACHUS._,_In._ Yet fire thou sayst is on the earth this day.
653,_INACHUS._,
654,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Not of his knowledge nor his gift, O king."
655,_INACHUS._,
656,_INACHUS._,_In._ By kindness of what god then has man fire?
657,_INACHUS._,
658,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ I say but on the earth unknown to Zeus.
659,_INACHUS._,
660,_INACHUS._,"_In._ How boastest thou to know, not of his knowledge?"
661,_INACHUS._,
662,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ I boast not: he that knoweth not may boast.
663,_INACHUS._,
664,_INACHUS._,_In._ Thy daring words bewilder sense with sound.
665,_INACHUS._,
666,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ I thought to find thee ripe for daring deeds.
667,_INACHUS._,
668,_INACHUS._,_In._ And what the deed for which I prove unripe?
669,_INACHUS._,
670,_INACHUS._,_Pr_. To take of heaven’s fire.
671,_INACHUS._,
672,_INACHUS._,"_In._ And were I ripe,"
673,_INACHUS._,"What should I dare, beseech you?"
674,_INACHUS._,
675,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ The wrath of Zeus.
676,_INACHUS._,
677,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Madman, pretending in one hand to hold"
678,_INACHUS._,The wrath of god and in the other fire.                          425
679,_INACHUS._,
680,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ Thou meanest rather holding both in one.
681,_INACHUS._,
682,_INACHUS._,_In._ Both impious art thou and incredible.
683,_INACHUS._,
684,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ Yet impious only till thou dost believe.
685,_INACHUS._,
686,_INACHUS._,"_In._ And what believe? Ah, if I could believe!"
687,_INACHUS._,"It was but now thou saidst that there was fire,"
688,_INACHUS._,And I was near believing; I believed:
689,_INACHUS._,Now to believe were to be mad as thou.
690,_INACHUS._,
691,_INACHUS._,_Chorus._ He may be mad and yet say true--maybe
692,_INACHUS._,The heat of prophecy like a strong wine
693,_INACHUS._,Shameth his reason with exultant speech.                         435
694,_INACHUS._,
695,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Thou say’st I am mad, and of my sober words"
696,_INACHUS._,"Hast called those impious which thou fearest true,"
697,_INACHUS._,"Those which thou knowest good, incredible."
698,_INACHUS._,Consider ere thou judge: be first assured
699,_INACHUS._,All is not good for man that seems god’s will.
700,_INACHUS._,"See, on thy farming skill, thy country toil                      441"
701,_INACHUS._,"Which bends to aid the willing fruits of earth,"
702,_INACHUS._,"And would promote the seasonable year,"
703,_INACHUS._,The face of nature is not always kind:
704,_INACHUS._,And if thou search the sum of visible being
705,_INACHUS._,"To find thy blessing featured, ’tis not there:"
706,_INACHUS._,Her best gifts cannot brim the golden cup
707,_INACHUS._,Of expectation which thine eager arms
708,_INACHUS._,Lift to her mouthèd horn--what then is this
709,_INACHUS._,Whose wide capacity outbids the scale                            450
710,_INACHUS._,"Of prodigal beauty, so that the seeing eye"
711,_INACHUS._,"And hearing ear, retiring unamazed"
712,_INACHUS._,"Within their quiet chambers, sit to feast"
713,_INACHUS._,"With dear imagination, nor look forth"
714,_INACHUS._,As once they did upon the varying air?
715,_INACHUS._,Whence is the fathering of this desire
716,_INACHUS._,Which mocks at fated circumstance? nay though
717,_INACHUS._,"Obstruction lie as cumbrous as the mountains,"
718,_INACHUS._,Nor thy particular hap hath armed desire
719,_INACHUS._,"Against the brunt of evil,--yet not for this                     460"
720,_INACHUS._,Faints man’s desire: it is the unquenchable
721,_INACHUS._,"Original cause, the immortal breath of being:"
722,_INACHUS._,"Nor is there any spirit on Earth astir,"
723,_INACHUS._,"Nor ’neath the airy vault, nor yet beyond"
724,_INACHUS._,"In any dweller in far-reaching space,"
725,_INACHUS._,Nobler or dearer than the spirit of man:
726,_INACHUS._,"That spirit which lives in each and will not die,"
727,_INACHUS._,"That wooeth beauty, and for all good things"
728,_INACHUS._,"Urgeth a voice, or in still passion sigheth,"
729,_INACHUS._,And where he loveth draweth the heart with him.
730,_INACHUS._,"Hast thou not heard him speaking oft and oft,"
731,_INACHUS._,Prompting thy secret musing and now shooting
732,_INACHUS._,"His feathered fancies, or in cloudy sleep                        473"
733,_INACHUS._,Piling his painted dreams? O hark to him!
734,_INACHUS._,For else if folly shut his joyous strength
735,_INACHUS._,"To mope in her dark prison without praise,"
736,_INACHUS._,The hidden tears with which he wails his wrong
737,_INACHUS._,Will sour the fount of life. O hark to him!
738,_INACHUS._,Him mayst thou trust beyond the things thou seest.
739,_INACHUS._,For many things there be upon this earth
740,_INACHUS._,"Unblest and fallen from beauty, to mislead"
741,_INACHUS._,"Man’s mind, and in a shadow justify"
742,_INACHUS._,The evil thoughts and deeds that work his ill;
743,_INACHUS._,"Fear, hatred, lust and strife, which, if man question"
744,_INACHUS._,"The heavenborn spirit within him, are not there."
745,_INACHUS._,"Yet are they bold of face, and Zeus himself,                     486"
746,_INACHUS._,"Seeing that Mischief held her head on high,"
747,_INACHUS._,Lest she should go beyond his power to quell
748,_INACHUS._,And draw the inevitable Fate that waits
749,_INACHUS._,"On utmost ill, himself preventing Fate"
750,_INACHUS._,"Hasted to drown the world, and now would crush"
751,_INACHUS._,Thy little remnant: but among the gods                           492
752,_INACHUS._,Is one whose love and courage stir for thee;
753,_INACHUS._,"Who being of manlike spirit, by many shifts"
754,_INACHUS._,"Has stayed the hand of the enemy, who crieth"
755,_INACHUS._,"Thy world is not destroyed, thy good shall live:"
756,_INACHUS._,"Thou hast more power for good than Zeus for ill,"
757,_INACHUS._,"More courage, justice, more abundant art,"
758,_INACHUS._,"More love, more joy, more reason: though around thee"
759,_INACHUS._,"Rank-rooting evil bloom with poisonous crown,"
760,_INACHUS._,Though wan and dolorous and crooked things                       501
761,_INACHUS._,"Have made their home with thee, thy good shall live."
762,_INACHUS._,"Know thy desire: and know that if thou seek it,"
763,_INACHUS._,"And seek, and seek, and fear not, thou shalt find."
764,_INACHUS._,
765,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). Is this a god that speaketh thus?
766,_INACHUS._,
767,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). He speaketh as a man
768,_INACHUS._,In love or great affliction yields his soul.
769,_INACHUS._,
770,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Thou, whencesoe’er thou comest, whoe’er thou art,"
771,_INACHUS._,Who breakest on our solemn sacrifice
772,_INACHUS._,"With solemn words, I pray thee not depart"
773,_INACHUS._,Till thou hast told me more. This fire I seek                    510
774,_INACHUS._,"Not for myself, whose thin and silvery hair"
775,_INACHUS._,"Tells that my toilsome age nears to its end,"
776,_INACHUS._,"But for my children and the aftertime,"
777,_INACHUS._,"For great the need thereof, wretched our state;"
778,_INACHUS._,"Nay, set by what has been, our happiness"
779,_INACHUS._,"Is very want, so that what now is not"
780,_INACHUS._,Is but the measure of what yet may be.
781,_INACHUS._,"And first are barest needs, which well I know"
782,_INACHUS._,"Fire would supply, but I have hope beyond,"
783,_INACHUS._,That Nature in recovering her right                              520
784,_INACHUS._,Would kinder prove to man who seeks to learn
785,_INACHUS._,Her secrets and unfold the cause of life.
786,_INACHUS._,"So tell me, if thou knowest, what is fire?"
787,_INACHUS._,"Doth earth contain it? or, since from the sun"
788,_INACHUS._,"Fire reaches us, since in the glimmering stars"
789,_INACHUS._,"And pallid moon, in lightning, and the glance"
790,_INACHUS._,Of tracking meteors that at nightfall show
791,_INACHUS._,How in the air a thousand sightless things
792,_INACHUS._,"Travel, and ever on their windswift course"
793,_INACHUS._,"Flame when they list and into darkness go,--530"
794,_INACHUS._,"Since in all these a fiery nature dwells,"
795,_INACHUS._,"Is fire an airy essence, a thing of heaven,"
796,_INACHUS._,"That, could we poise it, were an alien power"
797,_INACHUS._,"To make our wisdom less, our wonder more?"
798,_INACHUS._,
799,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Thy wish to know is good, and happy is he"
800,_INACHUS._,Who thus from chance and change has launched his mind
801,_INACHUS._,To dwell for ever with undisturbèd truth.
802,_INACHUS._,This high ambition doth not prompt his hand
803,_INACHUS._,"To crime, his right and pleasure are not wronged"
804,_INACHUS._,"By folly of his fellows, nor his eye                             540"
805,_INACHUS._,Dimmed by the griefs that move the tears of men.
806,_INACHUS._,"Son of the earth, and citizen may be"
807,_INACHUS._,"Of Argos or of Athens and her laws,"
808,_INACHUS._,"But still the eternal nature, where he looks,"
809,_INACHUS._,"O’errules him with the laws which laws obey,"
810,_INACHUS._,And in her heavenly city enrols his heart.
811,_INACHUS._,
812,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Thus ever have I held of happiness,"
813,_INACHUS._,"The child of heavenly truth, and thus have found it"
814,_INACHUS._,"In prayer and meditation and still thought,"
815,_INACHUS._,And thus my peace of mind based on a floor                       550
816,_INACHUS._,That doth not quaver like the joys of sense:
817,_INACHUS._,Those I possess enough in seeing my slaves
818,_INACHUS._,"And citizens enjoy, having myself"
819,_INACHUS._,Tasted for once and put their sweets away.
820,_INACHUS._,"But of that heavenly city, of which thou sayest"
821,_INACHUS._,"Her laws o’errule us, have I little learnt,"
822,_INACHUS._,For when my wandering spirit hath dared alone
823,_INACHUS._,"The unearthly terror of her voiceless halls,"
824,_INACHUS._,"She hath fallen from delight, and without guide"
825,_INACHUS._,"Turned back, and from her errand fled for fear.                  560"
826,_INACHUS._,
827,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Think not that thou canst all things know, nor deem"
828,_INACHUS._,Such knowledge happiness: the all-knowing Fates
829,_INACHUS._,"No pleasure have, who sit eternally"
830,_INACHUS._,"Spinning the unnumbered threads that Time hath woven,"
831,_INACHUS._,"And weaves, upgathering in his furthest house"
832,_INACHUS._,To store from sight; but what ’tis joy to learn
833,_INACHUS._,"Or use to know, that may’st thou ask of right."
834,_INACHUS._,
835,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Then tell me, for thou knowest, what is fire?"
836,_INACHUS._,
837,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Know then, O king, that this fair earth of men,"
838,_INACHUS._,"The Olympus of the gods, and all the heavens"
839,_INACHUS._,Are lesser kingdoms of the boundless space                       571
840,_INACHUS._,"Wherein Fate rules; they have their several times,"
841,_INACHUS._,"Their seasons and the limit of their thrones,"
842,_INACHUS._,And from the nature of eternal things
843,_INACHUS._,"Springing, themselves are changed; even as the trees"
844,_INACHUS._,"Or birds or beasts of earth, which now arise"
845,_INACHUS._,"To being, now in turn decay and die."
846,_INACHUS._,"The heaven and earth thou seest, for long were held"
847,_INACHUS._,"By Fire, a raging power, to whom the Fates"
848,_INACHUS._,"Decreed a slow diminishing old age,                              580"
849,_INACHUS._,"But to his daughter, who is that gentle goddess,"
850,_INACHUS._,"Queen of the clear and azure firmament,"
851,_INACHUS._,"In heaven called Hygra, but by mortals Air,"
852,_INACHUS._,"To her, the child of his slow doting years,"
853,_INACHUS._,"Was given a beauteous youth, not long to outlast"
854,_INACHUS._,"His life, but be the pride of his decay,"
855,_INACHUS._,And win to gentler sway his lost domains.
856,_INACHUS._,"And when the day of time arrived, when Air"
857,_INACHUS._,Took o’er from her decrepit sire the third
858,_INACHUS._,"Of the Sun’s kingdoms, the one-moonèd earth,"
859,_INACHUS._,Straight came she down to her inheritance.                       591
860,_INACHUS._,Gaze on the sun with thine unshaded eye
861,_INACHUS._,And shrink from what she saw. Forests of fire
862,_INACHUS._,"Whose waving trunks, sucking their fuel, reared"
863,_INACHUS._,"In branched flame roaring, and their torrid shades"
864,_INACHUS._,Aye underlit with fire. The mountains lifted
865,_INACHUS._,"And fell and followed like a running sea,"
866,_INACHUS._,And from their swelling flanks spumed froth of fire;
867,_INACHUS._,"Or, like awakening monsters, mighty mounds"
868,_INACHUS._,Rose on the plain awhile.
869,_INACHUS._,
870,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). He discovers a foe.                          600
871,_INACHUS._,
872,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). An enemy he paints.
873,_INACHUS._,
874,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ These all she quenched,"
875,_INACHUS._,Or charmed their fury into the dens and bowels
876,_INACHUS._,"Of earth to smoulder, there the vital heat"
877,_INACHUS._,"To hold for her creation, which then--to her aid"
878,_INACHUS._,"Summoning high Reason from his home in heaven,—"
879,_INACHUS._,She wrought anew upon the temperate lands.
880,_INACHUS._,
881,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). ’Twas well Air won this kingdom of her sire.
882,_INACHUS._,
883,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). Now say how made she green this home of fire.
884,_INACHUS._,
885,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ The waters first she brought, that in their streams"
886,_INACHUS._,And pools and seas innumerable things                            610
887,_INACHUS._,"Brought forth, from whence she drew the fertile seeds"
888,_INACHUS._,"Of trees and plants, and last of footed life,"
889,_INACHUS._,"That wandered forth, and roaming to and fro,"
890,_INACHUS._,The rejoicing earth peopled with living sound.
891,_INACHUS._,"Reason advised, and Reason praised her toil;"
892,_INACHUS._,"Which when she had done she gave him thanks, and said,"
893,_INACHUS._,"‘Fair comrade, since thou praisest what is done,"
894,_INACHUS._,Grant me this favour ere thou part from me:
895,_INACHUS._,"Make thou one fair thing for me, which shall suit"
896,_INACHUS._,"With what is made, and be the best of all.’                      620"
897,_INACHUS._,"’Twas evening, and that night Reason made man."
898,_INACHUS._,
899,_INACHUS._,"_Sem._ (_maidens_). Children of Air are we, and live by fire."
900,_INACHUS._,
901,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). The sons of Reason dwelling on the earth.
902,_INACHUS._,
903,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). Folk of a pleasant kingdom held between
904,_INACHUS._,Fire’s reign of terror and the latter day
905,_INACHUS._,"When dying, soon in turn his child must die."
906,_INACHUS._,
907,_INACHUS._,"_Sem._ (_youths_). Having a wise creator, above time"
908,_INACHUS._,"Or youth or change, from whom our kind inherit"
909,_INACHUS._,The grace and pleasure of the eternal gods.
910,_INACHUS._,
911,_INACHUS._,_In._ But how came gods to rule this earth of Air?
912,_INACHUS._,
913,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ They also were her children who first ruled,"
914,_INACHUS._,"Cronos, Iapetus, Hypérion,                                       632"
915,_INACHUS._,"Theia and Rhea, and other mighty names"
916,_INACHUS._,"That are but names--whom Zeus drave out from heaven,"
917,_INACHUS._,And with his tribe sits on their injured thrones.
918,_INACHUS._,
919,_INACHUS._,_In._ There is no greater god in heaven than he.
920,_INACHUS._,
921,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ Nor none more cruel nor more tyrannous.
922,_INACHUS._,
923,_INACHUS._,_In._ But what can man against the power of god?
924,_INACHUS._,
925,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ Doth not man strive with him? thyself dost pray.
926,_INACHUS._,
927,_INACHUS._,_In._ That he may pardon our contrarious deeds.
928,_INACHUS._,
929,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Alas! alas! what more contrarious deed,"
930,_INACHUS._,"What greater miracle of wrong than this,                         642"
931,_INACHUS._,That man should know his good and take it not?
932,_INACHUS._,To what god wilt thou pray to pardon this?
933,_INACHUS._,"In vain was reason given, if man therewith"
934,_INACHUS._,"Shame truth, and name it wisdom to cry down"
935,_INACHUS._,The unschooled promptings of his best desire.
936,_INACHUS._,The beasts that have no speech nor argument
937,_INACHUS._,"Confute him, and the wild hog in the wood"
938,_INACHUS._,"That feels his longing, hurries straight thereto,                650"
939,_INACHUS._,And will not turn his head.
940,_INACHUS._,
941,_INACHUS._,_In._ How mean’st thou this?
942,_INACHUS._,
943,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Thou hast desired the good, and now canst feel"
944,_INACHUS._,How hard it is to kill the heart’s desire.
945,_INACHUS._,
946,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Shall Inachus rise against Zeus, as he"
947,_INACHUS._,Rose against Cronos and made war in heaven?
948,_INACHUS._,
949,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ I say not so, yet, if thou didst rebel,"
950,_INACHUS._,The tongue that counselled Zeus should counsel thee.
951,_INACHUS._,
952,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). This is strange counsel.
953,_INACHUS._,
954,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). He is not
955,_INACHUS._,A counsellor for gods or men.
956,_INACHUS._,
957,_INACHUS._,"_In._ O that I knew where I might counsel find,"
958,_INACHUS._,"That one were sent, nay, were’t the least of all"
959,_INACHUS._,"The myriad messengers of heaven, to me!                          662"
960,_INACHUS._,"One that should say ’This morn I stood with Zeus,"
961,_INACHUS._,"He hath heard thy prayer and sent me: ask a boon,"
962,_INACHUS._,"What thing thou wilt, it shall be given thee.’"
963,_INACHUS._,
964,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ What wouldst thou say to such a messenger?
965,_INACHUS._,
966,_INACHUS._,"_In._ No need to ask then what I now might ask,"
967,_INACHUS._,"How ’tis the gods, if they have care for mortals,"
968,_INACHUS._,"Slubber our worst necessities--and the boon,"
969,_INACHUS._,No need to tell him that.
970,_INACHUS._,
971,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Now, king, thou seest"
972,_INACHUS._,"Zeus sends no messenger, but I am here."
973,_INACHUS._,
974,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Thy speech is hard, and even thy kindest words"
975,_INACHUS._,"Unkind. If fire thou hast, in thee ’tis kind"
976,_INACHUS._,To proffer it: but thou art more unkind
977,_INACHUS._,"Yoking heaven’s wrath therewith. Nay, and how knowest thou       675"
978,_INACHUS._,Zeus will be angry if I take of it?
979,_INACHUS._,"Thou art a prophet: ay, but of the prophets"
980,_INACHUS._,"Some have been taken in error, and honest time"
981,_INACHUS._,Has honoured many with forgetfulness.
982,_INACHUS._,I’ll make this proof of thee; Show me thy fire--
983,_INACHUS._,"Nay, give’t me now--if thou be true at all,"
984,_INACHUS._,"Be true so far: for the rest there’s none will lose,"
985,_INACHUS._,Nor blame thee being false--where is thy fire?
986,_INACHUS._,
987,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ O rather, had it thus been mine to give,"
988,_INACHUS._,I would have given it thus: not adding aught
989,_INACHUS._,Of danger or diminishment or loss;                               686
990,_INACHUS._,So strong is my goodwill; nor less than this
991,_INACHUS._,"My knowledge, but in knowledge all my power."
992,_INACHUS._,Yet since wise guidance with a little means
993,_INACHUS._,"Can more than force unminded, I have skill"
994,_INACHUS._,To conjure evil and outcompass strength.
995,_INACHUS._,"Now give I thee my best, a little gift"
996,_INACHUS._,To work a world of wonder; ’tis thine own
997,_INACHUS._,"Of long desire, and with it I will give"
998,_INACHUS._,The cunning of invention and all arts                            695
999,_INACHUS._,"In which thy hand instructed may command,"
1000,_INACHUS._,"Interpret, comfort, or ennoble nature;"
1001,_INACHUS._,"With all provision that in wisdom is,"
1002,_INACHUS._,And what prevention in foreknowledge lies.
1003,_INACHUS._,
1004,_INACHUS._,_In._ Great is the gain.
1005,_INACHUS._,
1006,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ O king, the gain is thine,"
1007,_INACHUS._,The penalty I more than share.
1008,_INACHUS._,
1009,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Enough,"
1010,_INACHUS._,I take thy gift; nor hast thou stood more firm
1011,_INACHUS._,"To every point of thy strange chequered tale,"
1012,_INACHUS._,"Revealing, threatening, offering more and more,"
1013,_INACHUS._,"And never all, than I to this resolve.                           705"
1014,_INACHUS._,
1015,_INACHUS._,_Pr._ I knew thy heart would fail not at the hour.
1016,_INACHUS._,
1017,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Nay, failed I now, what were my years of toil"
1018,_INACHUS._,"More than the endurance of a harnessed brute,"
1019,_INACHUS._,"Flogged to his daily work, that cannot view"
1020,_INACHUS._,The high design to which his labour steps?
1021,_INACHUS._,And I of all men were dishonoured most
1022,_INACHUS._,"Shrinking in fear, who never shrank from toil,"
1023,_INACHUS._,"And found abjuring, thrusting stiffly back,"
1024,_INACHUS._,The very gift for which I stretched my hands.
1025,_INACHUS._,What though I suffer? are these wintry years
1026,_INACHUS._,Of growing desolation to be held                                 716
1027,_INACHUS._,As cherishable as the suns of spring?
1028,_INACHUS._,"Nay, only joyful can they be in seeing"
1029,_INACHUS._,"Long hopes accomplished, long desires fulfilled."
1030,_INACHUS._,And since thou hast touched ambition on the side
1031,_INACHUS._,"Of nobleness, and stirred my proudest hope,"
1032,_INACHUS._,"And wilt fulfil this, shall I count the cost?"
1033,_INACHUS._,"Rather decay will triumph, and cold death"
1034,_INACHUS._,"Be lapped in glory, seeing strength arise                        724"
1035,_INACHUS._,"From weakness, from the tomb go forth a flame."
1036,_INACHUS._,
1037,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ ’Tis well; thou art exalted now, the grace"
1038,_INACHUS._,Becomes thy valiant spirit.
1039,_INACHUS._,
1040,_INACHUS._,_In._ Lo! on this day
1041,_INACHUS._,"Which hope despaired to see, hope manifests"
1042,_INACHUS._,A vision bright as were the dreams of youth;
1043,_INACHUS._,When life was easy as a sleeper’s faith
1044,_INACHUS._,Who swims in the air and dances on the sea;
1045,_INACHUS._,"When all the good that scarce by toil is won,"
1046,_INACHUS._,"Or not at all is won, is as a flower"
1047,_INACHUS._,Growing in plenty to be plucked at will:
1048,_INACHUS._,"Is it a dream again or is it truth,                              735"
1049,_INACHUS._,This vision fair of Greece inhabited?
1050,_INACHUS._,"A fairer sight than all fair Iris sees,"
1051,_INACHUS._,Footing her airy arch of colours spun
1052,_INACHUS._,"From Ida to Olympus, when she stays"
1053,_INACHUS._,To look on Greece and thinks the sight is fair;
1054,_INACHUS._,"Far fairer now, clothed with the works of men."
1055,_INACHUS._,
1056,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ Ay, fairer far: for nature’s varied pleasaunce"
1057,_INACHUS._,"Without man’s life is but a desert wild,"
1058,_INACHUS._,"Which most, where most she mocks him, needs his aid."
1059,_INACHUS._,She knows her silence sweeter when it girds                      745
1060,_INACHUS._,"His murmurous cities, her wide wasteful curves"
1061,_INACHUS._,Larger beside his economic line;
1062,_INACHUS._,"Or what can add a mystery to the dark,"
1063,_INACHUS._,As doth his measured music when it moves
1064,_INACHUS._,With rhythmic sweetness through the void of night?
1065,_INACHUS._,"Nay, all her loveliest places are but grounds"
1066,_INACHUS._,"Of vantage, where with geometric hand,"
1067,_INACHUS._,True square and careful compass he may come
1068,_INACHUS._,"To plan and plant and spread abroad his towers,"
1069,_INACHUS._,"His gardens, temples, palaces and tombs.                         755"
1070,_INACHUS._,"And yet not all thou seest, with trancèd eye"
1071,_INACHUS._,"Looking upon the beauty that shall be,"
1072,_INACHUS._,"The temple-crownèd heights, the wallèd towns,"
1073,_INACHUS._,"Farms and cool summer seats, nor the broad ways"
1074,_INACHUS._,"That bridge the rivers and subdue the mountains,"
1075,_INACHUS._,"Nor all that travels on them, pomp or war"
1076,_INACHUS._,"Or needful merchandise, nor all the sails"
1077,_INACHUS._,Piloting over the wind-dappled blue
1078,_INACHUS._,"Of the summer-soothed Ægean, to thy mind"
1079,_INACHUS._,Can picture what shall be: these are the face
1080,_INACHUS._,"And form of beauty, but her heart and life"
1081,_INACHUS._,"Shall they be who shall see it, born to shield"
1082,_INACHUS._,"A happier birthright with intrepid arms,"
1083,_INACHUS._,To tread down tyranny and fashion forth
1084,_INACHUS._,"A virgin wisdom to subdue the world,                             770"
1085,_INACHUS._,"To build for passion an eternal song,"
1086,_INACHUS._,"To shape her dreams in marble, and so sweet"
1087,_INACHUS._,"Their speech, that envious Time hearkening shall stay"
1088,_INACHUS._,"In fear to snatch, and hide his rugged hand."
1089,_INACHUS._,"Now is the birthday of thy conquering youth,"
1090,_INACHUS._,"O man, and lo! thy priest and prophet stand"
1091,_INACHUS._,Beside the altar and have blessed the day.
1092,_INACHUS._,
1093,_INACHUS._,"_In._ Ay, blessed be this day. Where is thy fire?"
1094,_INACHUS._,"Or is aught else to do, ere I may take?"
1095,_INACHUS._,
1096,_INACHUS._,"_Pr._ This was my message, speak and there is fire."
1097,_INACHUS._,
1098,_INACHUS._,_In._ There shall be fire. Await me here awhile.
1099,_INACHUS._,"I go to acquaint my house, and bring them forth."
1100,_INACHUS._,
1101,_INACHUS._,[_Exit._
1102,_INACHUS._,

1107,_INACHUS._,"And thou, O Earth, give ear!"
1108,_INACHUS._,There will be fire.
1109,_INACHUS._,
1110,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). Who shall be sent to fetch this fire
1111,_INACHUS._,for the king?
1112,_INACHUS._,
1113,_INACHUS._,"_Sem._ (_youths_). Shall we put forth in boats to reap,"
1114,_INACHUS._,And shall the waves for harvest yield

1116,_INACHUS._,Upon their ever-shifting field?
1117,_INACHUS._,

1120,_INACHUS._,The silv’ry glitter which they make
1121,_INACHUS._,Beneath into our baskets fall?
1122,_INACHUS._,
1123,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). To bind in sheaves and bear away
1124,_INACHUS._,The white unshafted darts of day?
1125,_INACHUS._,
1126,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_maidens_). And from the shadow one by one
1127,_INACHUS._,Pick up the playful oes of sun?
1128,_INACHUS._,
1129,_INACHUS._,_Sem._ (_youths_). Or wouldst thou mine a passage deep

1135,_INACHUS._,"To cup the slant and chinkèd beam,"
1136,_INACHUS._,Which mounting morn hath sent to dance
1137,_INACHUS._,Across our chamber while we dream?
1138,_INACHUS._,

1141,_INACHUS._,Our hope is impatient of vain debating.
1142,_INACHUS._,

1159,_ODE._,"The skies of day, the moon and the stars of night;"

1175,_ODE._,"Till thou, though uninvited, with fancy returnest"

1287,_ARGEIA._,"Nay, ’twas this very fire thou now would’st take,"
1288,_ARGEIA._,"Which vain Salmoneus, son of Æolus,                              921"

1295,_ARGEIA._,Rode with the ashes of his royal city
1296,_ARGEIA._,Upon the whirlwind of the riven air.
1297,_ARGEIA._,"And after him his brother Athamas,"
1298,_ARGEIA._,"King of Orchomenos, in frenzy fell"
1299,_ARGEIA._,"For Hera’s wrath, and raving killed his son;"
1300,_ARGEIA._,"And would have killed fair Ino, but that she fled"
1301,_ARGEIA._,"Into the sea, preferring there to woo                            934"
1302,_ARGEIA._,"The choking waters, rather than that the arm"
1303,_ARGEIA._,Which had so oft embraced should do her wrong.
1304,_ARGEIA._,For which old crimes the gods yet unappeased
1305,_ARGEIA._,"Demand a sacrifice, and the king’s son"
1306,_ARGEIA._,"Dreads the priest’s knife, and all the city mourns."
1307,_ARGEIA._,Or shall I say what shameful fury it was
1308,_ARGEIA._,"With which Poseidon smote Pasiphaë,"
1309,_ARGEIA._,But for neglect of a recorded vow:
1310,_ARGEIA._,Or how Actæon fared of Artemis
1311,_ARGEIA._,"When he surprised her, most himself surprised:"
1312,_ARGEIA._,And even while he looked his boasted bow
1313,_ARGEIA._,"Fell from his hands, and through his veins there ran"
1314,_ARGEIA._,"A strange oblivious trouble, darkening sense"
1315,_ARGEIA._,Till he knew nothing but a hideous fear
1316,_ARGEIA._,"Which bade him fly, and faster, as behind"
1317,_ARGEIA._,"He heard his hounds give tongue, that through the wood           950"
1318,_ARGEIA._,"Were following, closing, caught him and tore him down."
1319,_ARGEIA._,And many more thus perished in their prime;
1320,_ARGEIA._,"Lycaon and his fifty sons, whom Zeus"
1321,_ARGEIA._,"In their own house spied on, and unawares"
1322,_ARGEIA._,"Watching at hand, from his disguise arose,"
1323,_ARGEIA._,And overset the table where they sat
1324,_ARGEIA._,Around their impious feast and slew them all:
1325,_ARGEIA._,"Alcyonè and Ceyx, queen and king,"
1326,_ARGEIA._,Who for their arrogance were changed to birds:
1327,_ARGEIA._,"And Cadmus now a serpent, once a king:                           960"
1328,_ARGEIA._,"And saddest Niobe, whom not the love"
1329,_ARGEIA._,"Of Leto aught availed, when once her boast"
1330,_ARGEIA._,"Went out, though all her crime was too much pride"
1331,_ARGEIA._,"Of heaven’s most precious gift, her children fair."
1332,_ARGEIA._,"Six daughters had she, and six stalwart sons;"
1333,_ARGEIA._,But Leto bade her two destroy the twelve.
1334,_ARGEIA._,"And somewhere now, among lone mountain rocks"
1335,_ARGEIA._,"On Sipylus, where couch the nymphs at night"
1336,_ARGEIA._,"Who dance all day by Achelous’ stream,"
1337,_ARGEIA._,"The once proud mother lies, herself a rock,                      970"
1338,_ARGEIA._,And in cold breast broods o’er the goddess’ wrong.
1339,_ARGEIA._,
1340,_ARGEIA._,_In._ Now hush thy fear. See how thou tremblest still.
1341,_ARGEIA._,"Or if thou fear, fear passion; for the freshes"
1342,_ARGEIA._,Of tenderness and motherly love will drown
1343,_ARGEIA._,"The eye of judgment: yet, since even excess"
1344,_ARGEIA._,"Of the soft quality fits woman well,"
1345,_ARGEIA._,I praise thee; nor would ask thee less to aid
1346,_ARGEIA._,"With counsel, than in love to share my choice."
1347,_ARGEIA._,"Tho’ weak thy hands to poise, thine eye may mark"
1348,_ARGEIA._,"This balance, how the good of all outweighs                      980"

1359,_ARGEIA._,"Hath such prolific consequence, that Virtue"
1360,_ARGEIA._,"Cometh of ancestry more pure than blood,                         990"

1376,_ARGEIA._,
1377,_ARGEIA._,_Pr._ Bid me not tell if ye have fear to hear;

1388,_ARGEIA._,"His fate unquestioned, his foretasted pain,"
1389,_ARGEIA._,"The certainty foreknown of things unknown,"

1392,_ARGEIA._,"His eager hand, nor loosen the desire"

1402,_ARGEIA._,
1403,_ARGEIA._,_In._ What sayst thou? drive her out? and we? from home?        1026
1404,_ARGEIA._,Banish the comfort of our eyes? Nay rather
1405,_ARGEIA._,Believe that these obedient hands will tear

1414,_ARGEIA._,"Drifts from her couch away,--when, if asleep,"
1415,_ARGEIA._,"She walks as if awake, and if awake"
1416,_ARGEIA._,"Dreams, and as one who nothing hears or sees,"
1417,_ARGEIA._,"Lives in a sick and frantic mood, whose cause"

1425,_ARGEIA._,Apollo’s oracle.
1426,_ARGEIA._,

1909,_ARGEIA._,And the god of my love shall rejoice at the sound of my song.

1917,_ARGEIA._,"The words of his mouth rare and precious,"
1918,_ARGEIA._,His eyes’ glance and the smile of his lips are love.
1919,_ARGEIA._,He is the one                                                 1447

2215,MARCH,"Honey on his tongue, and all his body filleth"
2216,MARCH,With wanton lightsomeness in every part.
2217,MARCH,
2218,MARCH,
2219,MARCH,17
2220,MARCH,
2221,MARCH,"Naked he goeth, but with sprightly wings"
2222,MARCH,"Red, iridescent, are his shoulders fledged."
2223,MARCH,"A bow his weapon, which he deftly strings,"
2224,MARCH,And little arrows barb’d and keenly edged;
2225,MARCH,And these he shooteth true; but else the youth
2226,MARCH,"For all his seeming recketh naught of truth,"
2227,MARCH,But most deceiveth where he most is pledged.
2228,MARCH,
2229,MARCH,
2230,MARCH,18
2231,MARCH,
2232,MARCH,’Tis he that maketh in men’s heart a strife
2233,MARCH,"Between remorseful reason and desire,"
2234,MARCH,"Till with life lost they lose the love of life,"
2235,MARCH,And by their own hands wretchedly expire;
2236,MARCH,Or slain in bloody rivalries they miss
2237,MARCH,"Even the short embracement of their bliss,"
2238,MARCH,His smile of fury and his kiss of fire.
2239,MARCH,
2240,MARCH,
2241,MARCH,19
2242,MARCH,
2243,MARCH,"He makes the strong man weak, the weak man wild;"
2244,MARCH,Ruins great business and purpose high;
2245,MARCH,"Brings down the wise to folly reconciled,"
2246,MARCH,And martial captains on their knees to sigh:
2247,MARCH,"He changeth dynasties, and on the head"
2248,MARCH,"Of duteous heroes, who for honour bled,"
2249,MARCH,Smircheth the laurel that can never die.
2250,MARCH,
2251,MARCH,
2252,MARCH,20
2253,MARCH,
2254,MARCH,"Him then she call’d, and gravely kissing told"
2255,MARCH,The great dishonour to her godhead done;
2256,MARCH,"And how, if he from that in heaven would hold,"
2257,MARCH,On earth he must maintain it as her son;
2258,MARCH,"The rather that his weapons were most fit,"
2259,MARCH,As was his skill ordain’d to champion it;
2260,MARCH,And flattering thus his ready zeal she won.
2261,MARCH,
2262,MARCH,
2263,MARCH,21
2264,MARCH,
2265,MARCH,"Whereon she quickly led him down on earth,"
2266,MARCH,"And show’d him PSYCHE, thus the maid was named;"
2267,MARCH,"Whom when she show’d, but could not hide her worth,"
2268,MARCH,She grew with envy tenfold more enflamed.
2269,MARCH,"‘But if,’ she cried, ‘thou smite her as I bid,"
2270,MARCH,"Soon shall our glory of this affront be rid,"
2271,MARCH,And she and all her likes for ever shamed.
2272,MARCH,
2273,MARCH,
2274,MARCH,22
2275,MARCH,
2276,MARCH,"‘Make her to love the loathliest, basest wretch,"
2277,MARCH,"Deform’d in body, and of moonstruck mind,"
2278,MARCH,"A hideous brute and vicious, born to fetch"
2279,MARCH,Anger from dogs and cursing from the blind.
2280,MARCH,And let her passion for the monster be
2281,MARCH,As shameless and detestable as he
2282,MARCH,Is most extreme and vile of humankind.’
2283,MARCH,
2284,MARCH,
2285,MARCH,23
2286,MARCH,
2287,MARCH,"Which said, when he agreed, she spake no more,"
2288,MARCH,"But left him to his task, and took her way"
2289,MARCH,"Beside the ripples of the shell-strewn shore,"
2290,MARCH,"The southward stretching margin of a bay,"
2291,MARCH,"Whose sandy curves she pass’d, and taking stand"
2292,MARCH,"Upon its taper horn of furthest land,"
2293,MARCH,Lookt left and right to rise and set of day.
2294,MARCH,
2295,MARCH,
2296,MARCH,24
2297,MARCH,
2298,MARCH,"Fair was the sight; for now, though full an hour"
2299,MARCH,"The sun had sunk, she saw the evening light"
2300,MARCH,"In shifting colour to the zenith tower,"
2301,MARCH,And grow more gorgeous ever and more bright.
2302,MARCH,"Bathed in the warm and comfortable glow,"
2303,MARCH,"The fair delighted queen forgot her woe,"
2304,MARCH,And watch’d the unwonted pageant of the night.
2305,MARCH,
2306,MARCH,
2307,MARCH,25
2308,MARCH,
2309,MARCH,"Broad and low down, where late the sun had been,"
2310,MARCH,"A wealth of orange-gold was thickly shed,"
2311,MARCH,"Fading above into a field of green,"
2312,MARCH,Like apples ere they ripen into red;
2313,MARCH,Then to the height a variable hue
2314,MARCH,"Of rose and pink and crimson freak’d with blue,"
2315,MARCH,And olive-border’d clouds o’er lilac led.
2316,MARCH,
2317,MARCH,
2318,MARCH,26
2319,MARCH,
2320,MARCH,High in the opposèd west the wondering moon
2321,MARCH,All silvery green in flying green was fleec’t;
2322,MARCH,And round the blazing South the splendour soon
2323,MARCH,"Caught all the heaven, and ran to North and East;"
2324,MARCH,And Aphrodite knew the thing was wrought
2325,MARCH,"By cunning of Poseidon, and she thought"
2326,MARCH,She would go see with whom he kept his feast.
2327,MARCH,
2328,MARCH,
2329,MARCH,27
2330,MARCH,
2331,MARCH,Swift to her wish came swimming on the waves
2332,MARCH,"His lovely ocean nymphs, her guides to be,"
2333,MARCH,"The Nereids all, who live among the caves"
2334,MARCH,"And valleys of the deep, Cymodocè,"
2335,MARCH,"Agavè, blue-eyed Hallia and Nesæa,"
2336,MARCH,"Speio, and Thoë, Glaucè and Actæa,"
2337,MARCH,"Iaira, Melitè and Amphinomè,"
2338,MARCH,
2339,MARCH,
2340,MARCH,28
2341,MARCH,
2342,MARCH,"Apseudès and Nemertès, Callianassa,"
2343,MARCH,"Cymothoë, Thaleia, Limnorrhea,"
2344,MARCH,"Clymenè, Ianeira and Ianassa,"
2345,MARCH,"Doris and Panopè and Galatea,"
2346,MARCH,"Dynamenè, Dexamenè and Maira,"

2349,MARCH,
2350,MARCH,
2351,MARCH,29
2352,MARCH,
2353,MARCH,And after them sad Melicertes drave
2354,MARCH,"His chariot, that with swift unfellied wheel,"
2355,MARCH,"By his two dolphins drawn along the wave,"
2356,MARCH,"Flew as they plunged, yet did not dip nor reel,"
2357,MARCH,But like a plough that shears the heavy land
2358,MARCH,"Stood on the flood, and back on either hand"
2359,MARCH,O’erturn’d the briny furrow with its keel.
2360,MARCH,
2361,MARCH,
2362,MARCH,30
2363,MARCH,
2364,MARCH,"Behind came Tritons, that their conches blew,"
2365,MARCH,"Greenbearded, tail’d like fish, all sleek and stark;"
2366,MARCH,"And hippocampi tamed, a bristly crew,"
2367,MARCH,"The browzers of old Proteus’ weedy park,"
2368,MARCH,"Whose chiefer Mermen brought a shell for boat,"
2369,MARCH,"And balancing its hollow fan afloat,"
2370,MARCH,Push’d it to shore and bade the queen embark:
2371,MARCH,
2372,MARCH,
2373,MARCH,31
2374,MARCH,
2375,MARCH,And then the goddess stept upon the shell
2376,MARCH,Which took her weight; and others threw a train
2377,MARCH,"Of soft silk o’er her, that unfurl’d to swell"
2378,MARCH,"In sails, at breath of flying Zephyrs twain;"
2379,MARCH,"And all her way with foam in laughter strewn,"
2380,MARCH,"With stir of music and of conches blown,"
2381,MARCH,Was Aphrodite launch’d upon the main.

2386,APRIL,APRIL
2387,APRIL,
2388,APRIL,
2389,APRIL,1
2390,APRIL,
2391,APRIL,"But fairest Psyche still in favour rose,"
2392,APRIL,Nor knew the jealous power against her sworn:
2393,APRIL,"And more her beauty now surpass’t her foe’s,"
2394,APRIL,"Since ’twas transfigured by the spirit forlorn,"
2395,APRIL,"That writeth, to the perfecting of grace,"
2396,APRIL,"Immortal question in a mortal face,"
2397,APRIL,The vague desire whereunto man is born.
2398,APRIL,
2399,APRIL,
2400,APRIL,2
2401,APRIL,
2402,APRIL,"Already in good time her sisters both,"
2403,APRIL,"Whose honest charms were never famed as hers,"
2404,APRIL,"With princes of the isle had plighted troth,"
2405,APRIL,And gone to rule their foreign courtiers;
2406,APRIL,"But she, exalted evermore beyond"
2407,APRIL,"Their loveliness, made yet no lover fond,"
2408,APRIL,And gain’d but number to her worshippers.
2409,APRIL,
2410,APRIL,
2411,APRIL,3
2412,APRIL,
2413,APRIL,"To joy in others’ joy had been her lot,"
2414,APRIL,And now that that was gone she wept to see
2415,APRIL,How her transcendent beauty overshot
2416,APRIL,The common aim of all felicity.
2417,APRIL,For love she sigh’d; and had some peasant rude
2418,APRIL,"For true love’s sake in simple passion woo’d,"
2419,APRIL,Then Psyche had not scorn’d his wife to be.
2420,APRIL,
2421,APRIL,
2422,APRIL,4
2423,APRIL,
2424,APRIL,"For what is Beauty, if it doth not fire"
2425,APRIL,The loving answer of an eager soul?
2426,APRIL,"Since ’tis the native food of man’s desire,"
2427,APRIL,And doth to good our varying world control;
2428,APRIL,"Which, when it was not, was for Beauty’s sake"
2429,APRIL,"Desired and made by Love, who still doth make"
2430,APRIL,A beauteous path thereon to Beauty’s goal.
2431,APRIL,
2432,APRIL,
2433,APRIL,5
2434,APRIL,
2435,APRIL,"Should all men by some hateful venom die,"
2436,APRIL,The pity were that o’er the unpeopl’d sphere
2437,APRIL,The sun would still bedeck the evening sky
2438,APRIL,"And the unimaginable hues appear,"
2439,APRIL,With none to mark the rose and gold and green;
2440,APRIL,"That Spring should walk the earth, and nothing seen"
2441,APRIL,Of her fresh delicacy year by year.
2442,APRIL,
2443,APRIL,
2444,APRIL,6
2445,APRIL,
2446,APRIL,"And if some beauteous things,--whose heavenly worth"
2447,APRIL,"And function overpass our mortal sense,—"
2448,APRIL,Lie waste and unregarded on the earth
2449,APRIL,"By reason of our gross intelligence,"
2450,APRIL,"These are not vain, because in nature’s scheme"
2451,APRIL,It lives that we shall grow from dream to dream
2452,APRIL,In time to gather an enchantment thence.
2453,APRIL,
2454,APRIL,
2455,APRIL,7
2456,APRIL,
2457,APRIL,Even as we see the fairest works of men
2458,APRIL,"Awhile neglected, and the makers die;"
2459,APRIL,"But Truth comes weeping to their graves, and then"
2460,APRIL,Their fames victoriously mounting high
2461,APRIL,"Do battle with the regnant names of eld,"
2462,APRIL,To win their seats; as when the Gods rebel’d
2463,APRIL,Against their sires and drave them from the sky.
2464,APRIL,
2465,APRIL,
2466,APRIL,8
2467,APRIL,
2468,APRIL,But to be praised for beauty and denied
2469,APRIL,"The meed of beauty, this was yet unknown:"
2470,APRIL,The best and bravest men have ever vied
2471,APRIL,To win the fairest women for their own.
2472,APRIL,"Thus Psyche spake, or reason’d in her mind,"
2473,APRIL,"Disconsolate; and with self-pity pined,"
2474,APRIL,In the deserted halls wandering alone.
2475,APRIL,
2476,APRIL,
2477,APRIL,9
2478,APRIL,
2479,APRIL,And grievèd grew the King to see her woe:
2480,APRIL,"And blaming first the gods for her disease,"
2481,APRIL,He purposed to their oracle to go
2482,APRIL,"To question how he might their wrath appease,"
2483,APRIL,"Or, if that might not be, the worst to hear,—"
2484,APRIL,Which is the last poor hope of them that fear.—
2485,APRIL,"So he took his ship upon the northern seas,"
2486,APRIL,
2487,APRIL,
2488,APRIL,10
2489,APRIL,
2490,APRIL,"And journeying to the shrine of Delphi went,"
2491,APRIL,"The temple of Apollo Pythian,"
2492,APRIL,Where when the god he question’d if ’twas meant
2493,APRIL,"That Psyche should be wed, and to what man,"
2494,APRIL,"The tripod shook, and o’er the vaporous well"
2495,APRIL,"The chanting Pythoness gave oracle,"
2496,APRIL,And thus in priestly verse the sentence ran:
2497,APRIL,
2498,APRIL,
2499,APRIL,11
2500,APRIL,
2501,APRIL,_High on the topmost rock with funeral feast
2502,APRIL,"Convey and leave the maid, nor look to find"
2503,APRIL,"A mortal husband, but a savage beast,"
2504,APRIL,The viperous scourge of gods and humankind;
2505,APRIL,"Who shames and vexes all, and as he flies"
2506,APRIL,"With sword and fire, Zeus trembles in the skies,"
2507,APRIL,And groans arise from souls to hell consign’d._
2508,APRIL,
2509,APRIL,
2510,APRIL,12
2511,APRIL,
2512,APRIL,With which reply the King return’d full sad:
2513,APRIL,"For though he nothing more might understand,"
2514,APRIL,Yet in the bitter bidding that he had
2515,APRIL,"No man made question of the plain command,"
2516,APRIL,That he must sacrifice the tender flower
2517,APRIL,"Of his own blood to a demonian power,"
2518,APRIL,Upon the rocky mount with his own hand.
2519,APRIL,
2520,APRIL,
2521,APRIL,13
2522,APRIL,
2523,APRIL,"Some said that she to Talos was devote,"
2524,APRIL,"The metal giant, who with mile-long stride"
2525,APRIL,"Cover’d the isle, walking around by rote"
2526,APRIL,Thrice every day at his appointed tide;
2527,APRIL,"Who shepherded the sea-goats on the coast,"
2528,APRIL,"And, as he past, caught up and live would roast,"
2529,APRIL,Pressing them to his burning ribs and side:
2530,APRIL,
2531,APRIL,
2532,APRIL,14
2533,APRIL,
2534,APRIL,"Whose head was made of fine gold-beaten work,"
2535,APRIL,"Of silver pure his arms and gleaming chest,"
2536,APRIL,"Thence of green-bloomèd bronze far as the fork,"
2537,APRIL,Of iron weather-rusted all the rest.
2538,APRIL,"One single vein he had, which running down"
2539,APRIL,"From head to foot was open in his crown,"
2540,APRIL,And closèd by a nail; such was this pest.
2541,APRIL,
2542,APRIL,
2543,APRIL,15
2544,APRIL,
2545,APRIL,"A little while they spent in sad delay,"
2546,APRIL,"Then order’d, as the oracle had said,"
2547,APRIL,The cold feast and funereal display
2548,APRIL,Wherewith the fated bridal should be sped:
2549,APRIL,And their black pageantry and vain despairing
2550,APRIL,"When Psyche saw, and for herself preparing"
2551,APRIL,"The hopeless ceremonial of the dead,"
2552,APRIL,
2553,APRIL,
2554,APRIL,16
2555,APRIL,
2556,APRIL,"Then spake she to the King and said ‘O Sire,"
2557,APRIL,Why wilt thou veil those venerable eyes
2558,APRIL,"With piteous tears, which must of me require"
2559,APRIL,More tears again than for myself arise?
2560,APRIL,"Then, on the day my beauty first o’erstept"
2561,APRIL,Its mortal place it had been well to have wept;
2562,APRIL,But now the fault beyond our ruing lies.
2563,APRIL,
2564,APRIL,
2565,APRIL,17
2566,APRIL,
2567,APRIL,"‘As to be worship’d was my whole undoing,"
2568,APRIL,So my submission must the forfeit pay:
2569,APRIL,"And welcome were the morning of my wooing,"
2570,APRIL,Tho’ after it should dawn no other day.
2571,APRIL,Up to the mountain! for I hear the voice
2572,APRIL,"Of my belovèd on the winds, _Rejoice,"
2573,APRIL,"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away!_’"
2574,APRIL,
2575,APRIL,
2576,APRIL,18
2577,APRIL,
2578,APRIL,"With such distemper’d speech, that little cheer’d"
2579,APRIL,"Her mourning house, she went to choose with care"
2580,APRIL,"The raiment for her day of wedlock weird,"
2581,APRIL,Her body as for burial to prepare;
2582,APRIL,"But laved with bridal water, from the stream"
2583,APRIL,Where Hera bathed; for still her fate supreme
2584,APRIL,"Was doubtful, whether Love or Death it were:"
2585,APRIL,
2586,APRIL,
2587,APRIL,19
2588,APRIL,
2589,APRIL,"Love that is made of joy, and Death of fear:"
2590,APRIL,"Nay, but not these held Psyche in suspense;"
2591,APRIL,Hers was the hope that following by the bier
2592,APRIL,Boweth its head beneath the dark immense:
2593,APRIL,Her fear the dread of life that turns to hide
2594,APRIL,"Its tragic tears, what hour the happy bride"
2595,APRIL,Ventures for love her maiden innocence.
2596,APRIL,
2597,APRIL,
2598,APRIL,20
2599,APRIL,
2600,APRIL,They set on high upon the bridal wain
2601,APRIL,"Her bed for bier, and yet no corpse thereon;"
2602,APRIL,But like as when unto a warrior slain
2603,APRIL,And not brought home the ceremonies done
2604,APRIL,"Are empty, for afar his body brave"
2605,APRIL,"Lies lost, deep buried by the wandering wave,"
2606,APRIL,"Or ’neath the foes his fury fell upon,—"
2607,APRIL,
2608,APRIL,
2609,APRIL,21
2610,APRIL,
2611,APRIL,"So was her hearse: and with it went afore,"
2612,APRIL,"Singing the solemn dirge that moves to tears,"
2613,APRIL,"The singers; and behind, clad as for war,"
2614,APRIL,"The King uncrown’d among his mournful peers,"
2615,APRIL,All ’neath their armour robed in linen white;
2616,APRIL,"And in their left were shields, and in their right"
2617,APRIL,Torches they bore aloft instead of spears.
2618,APRIL,
2619,APRIL,
2620,APRIL,22
2621,APRIL,
2622,APRIL,"And next the virgin tribe in white forth sail’d,"
2623,APRIL,With wreaths of dittany; and ’midst them there
2624,APRIL,"Went Psyche, all in lily-whiteness veil’d,"
2625,APRIL,The white Quince-blossom chapleting her hair:
2626,APRIL,"And last the common folk, a weeping crowd,"
2627,APRIL,Far as the city-gates with wailings loud
2628,APRIL,Follow’d the sad procession in despair.
2629,APRIL,
2630,APRIL,
2631,APRIL,23
2632,APRIL,
2633,APRIL,"Thus forth and up the mount they went, until"
2634,APRIL,"The funeral chariot must be left behind,"
2635,APRIL,Since road was none for steepness of the hill;
2636,APRIL,And slowly by the narrow path they wind:
2637,APRIL,All afternoon their white and scatter’d file
2638,APRIL,"Toil’d on distinct, ascending many a mile"
2639,APRIL,Over the long brown slopes and crags unkind.
2640,APRIL,
2641,APRIL,
2642,APRIL,24
2643,APRIL,
2644,APRIL,But ere unto the snowy peak they came
2645,APRIL,"Of that stormshapen pyramid so high,"
2646,APRIL,"’Twas evening, and with footsteps slow and lame"
2647,APRIL,They gather’d up their lagging company:
2648,APRIL,"And then her sire, even as Apollo bade,"
2649,APRIL,"Set on the topmost rock the hapless maid,"
2650,APRIL,With trembling hands and melancholy cry.
2651,APRIL,
2652,APRIL,
2653,APRIL,25
2654,APRIL,
2655,APRIL,And now the sun was sunk; only the peak
2656,APRIL,Flash’d like a jewel in the deepening blue:
2657,APRIL,"And from the shade beneath none dared to speak,"
2658,APRIL,"But all look’d up, where glorified anew"
2659,APRIL,Psyche sat islanded in living day.
2660,APRIL,"Breathless they watcht her, till the last red ray"
2661,APRIL,Fled from her lifted arm that waved adieu.
2662,APRIL,
2663,APRIL,
2664,APRIL,26
2665,APRIL,
2666,APRIL,"There left they her, turning with sad farewells"
2667,APRIL,"To haste their homeward course, as best they might:"
2668,APRIL,"But night was crowding up the barren fells,"
2669,APRIL,And hid full soon their rocky path from sight;
2670,APRIL,And each unto his stumbling foot to hold
2671,APRIL,"His torch was fain, for o’er the moon was roll’d"
2672,APRIL,"A mighty cloud from heaven, to blot her light."
2673,APRIL,
2674,APRIL,
2675,APRIL,27
2676,APRIL,
2677,APRIL,And thro’ the darkness for long while was seen
2678,APRIL,That armour’d train with waving fires to thread
2679,APRIL,"Downwards, by pass, defile, and black ravine,"
2680,APRIL,Each leading on the way that he was led.
2681,APRIL,"Slowly they gain’d the plain, and one by one"
2682,APRIL,"Into the shadows of the woods were gone,"
2683,APRIL,Or in the clinging mists were quench’d and fled.
2684,APRIL,
2685,APRIL,
2686,APRIL,28
2687,APRIL,
2688,APRIL,"But unto Psyche, pondering o’er her doom"
2689,APRIL,"In tearful silence on her stony chair,"
2690,APRIL,A Zephyr straying out of heaven’s wide room
2691,APRIL,"Rush’d down, and gathering round her unaware"
2692,APRIL,Fill’d with his breath her vesture and her veil;
2693,APRIL,"And like a ship, that crowding all her sail"
2694,APRIL,"Leans to accompany the tranquil air,"
2695,APRIL,
2696,APRIL,
2697,APRIL,29
2698,APRIL,
2699,APRIL,"She yielded, and was borne with swimming brain"
2700,APRIL,"And airy joy, along the mountain side,"
2701,APRIL,"Till, hid from earth by ridging summits twain,"
2702,APRIL,They came upon a valley deep and wide;
2703,APRIL,"Where the strong Zephyr with his burden sank,"
2704,APRIL,"And laid her down upon a grassy bank,"
2705,APRIL,’Mong thyme and violets and daisies pied.
2706,APRIL,
2707,APRIL,
2708,APRIL,30
2709,APRIL,
2710,APRIL,And straight upon the touch of that sweet bed
2711,APRIL,Both woe and wonder melted fast away:
2712,APRIL,"And sleep with gentle stress her sense o’erspread,"
2713,APRIL,Gathering as darkness doth on drooping day:
2714,APRIL,"And nestling to the ground, she slowly drew"
2715,APRIL,"Her wearied limbs together, and, ere she knew,"
2716,APRIL,Wrapt in forgetfulness and slumber lay.
2717,APRIL,
2718,APRIL,
2719,APRIL,
2720,APRIL,
2721,MAY,MAY
2722,MAY,
2723,MAY,
2724,MAY,1
2725,MAY,
2726,MAY,After long sleep when Psyche first awoke
2727,MAY,"Among the grasses ’neath the open skies,"
2728,MAY,"And heard the mounting larks, whose carol spoke"
2729,MAY,"Delighted invitation to arise,"
2730,MAY,She lay as one who after many a league
2731,MAY,"Hath slept off memory with his long fatigue,"
2732,MAY,And waking knows not in what place he lies:
2733,MAY,
2734,MAY,
2735,MAY,2
2736,MAY,
2737,MAY,"Anon her quickening thought took up its task,"
2738,MAY,And all came back as it had happ’d o’ernight;
2739,MAY,"The sad procession of the wedding mask,"
2740,MAY,"The melancholy toiling up the height,"
2741,MAY,The solitary rock where she was left;
2742,MAY,"And thence in dark and airy waftage reft,"
2743,MAY,How on the flowers she had been disburden’d light.
2744,MAY,
2745,MAY,
2746,MAY,3
2747,MAY,
2748,MAY,Thereafter she would rise and see what place
2749,MAY,"That voyage had its haven in, and found"
2750,MAY,"She stood upon a little hill, whose base"
2751,MAY,Shelved off into the valley all around;
2752,MAY,"And all round that the steep cliffs rose away,"
2753,MAY,Save on one side where to the break of day
2754,MAY,The widening dale withdrew in falling ground.
2755,MAY,
2756,MAY,
2757,MAY,4
2758,MAY,
2759,MAY,"There, out from over sea, and scarce so high"
2760,MAY,"As she, the sun above his watery blaze"
2761,MAY,"Upbroke the grey dome of the morning sky,"
2762,MAY,And struck the island with his level rays;
2763,MAY,"Sifting his gold thro’ lazy mists, that still"
2764,MAY,"Climb’d on the shadowy roots of every hill,"
2765,MAY,And in the tree-tops breathed their silvery haze.
2766,MAY,
2767,MAY,
2768,MAY,5
2769,MAY,
2770,MAY,At hand on either side there was a wood;
2771,MAY,"And on the upward lawn, that sloped between,"
2772,MAY,"Not many paces back a temple stood,"
2773,MAY,By even steps ascending from the green;
2774,MAY,"With shaft and pediment of marble made,"
2775,MAY,"It fill’d the passage of the rising glade,"
2776,MAY,And there withstay’d the sun in dazzling sheen.
2777,MAY,
2778,MAY,
2779,MAY,6
2780,MAY,
2781,MAY,"Too fair for human art, so Psyche thought,"
2782,MAY,It might the fancy of some god rejoice;
2783,MAY,"Like to those halls which lame Hephæstos wrought,"
2784,MAY,"Original, for each god to his choice,"
2785,MAY,In high Olympus; where his matchless lyre
2786,MAY,"Apollo wakes, and the responsive choir"
2787,MAY,Of Muses sing alternate with sweet voice.
2788,MAY,
2789,MAY,
2790,MAY,7
2791,MAY,
2792,MAY,"Wondering she drew anigh, and in a while"
2793,MAY,"Went up the steps as she would entrance win,"
2794,MAY,And faced her shadow ’neath the peristyle
2795,MAY,"Upon the golden gate, whose flanges twin--"
2796,MAY,"As there she stood, irresolute at heart"
2797,MAY,To try--swung to her of themselves apart;
2798,MAY,Whereat she past between and stood within.
2799,MAY,
2800,MAY,
2801,MAY,8
2802,MAY,
2803,MAY,"A foursquare court it was with marble floor’d,"
2804,MAY,"Embay’d about with pillar’d porticoes,"
2805,MAY,That echo’d in a somnolent accord
2806,MAY,"The music of a fountain, which arose"
2807,MAY,"Sparkling in air, and splashing in its tank;"
2808,MAY,"Whose wanton babble, as it swell’d or sank,"
2809,MAY,Gave idle voice to silence and repose.
2810,MAY,
2811,MAY,
2812,MAY,9
2813,MAY,
2814,MAY,"Thro’ doors beneath the further colonnade,"
2815,MAY,"Like a deep cup’s reflected glooms of gold,"
2816,MAY,The inner rooms glow’d with inviting shade:
2817,MAY,"And, standing in the court, she might behold"
2818,MAY,"Cedar, and silk, and silver; and that all"
2819,MAY,The pargeting of ceiling and of wall
2820,MAY,Was fresco’d o’er with figures manifold.
2821,MAY,
2822,MAY,
2823,MAY,10
2824,MAY,
2825,MAY,"Then making bold to go within, she heard"
2826,MAY,Murmur of gentle welcome in her ear;
2827,MAY,"And seeing none that coud have spoken word,"
2828,MAY,"She waited: when again Lady, draw near;"
2829,MAY,Enter! was cried; and now more voices came
2830,MAY,"From all the air around calling her name,"
2831,MAY,And bidding her rejoice and have no fear.
2832,MAY,
2833,MAY,
2834,MAY,11
2835,MAY,
2836,MAY,"And one, if she would rest, would show her bed,"
2837,MAY,"Pillow’d for sleep, with fragrant linen fine;"
2838,MAY,"One, were she hungry, had a table spread"
2839,MAY,Like as the high gods have it when they dine:
2840,MAY,"Or, would she bathe, were those would heat the bath;"
2841,MAY,"The joyous cries contending in her path,"
2842,MAY,"Psyche, they said, What wilt thou? all is thine."
2843,MAY,
2844,MAY,
2845,MAY,12
2846,MAY,
2847,MAY,"Then Psyche would have thank’d their service true,"
2848,MAY,But that she fear’d her echoing words might scare
2849,MAY,Those sightless tongues; and well by dream she knew
2850,MAY,"The voices of the messengers of prayer,"
2851,MAY,"Which fly upon the gods’ commandment, when"
2852,MAY,"They answer the supreme desires of men,"
2853,MAY,Or for a while in pity hush their care.
2854,MAY,
2855,MAY,
2856,MAY,13
2857,MAY,
2858,MAY,"’Twas fancy’s consummation, and because"
2859,MAY,"She would do joy no curious despite,"
2860,MAY,She made no wonder how the wonder was;
2861,MAY,Only concern’d to take her full delight.
2862,MAY,"So to the bath,--what luxury could be"
2863,MAY,Better enhanced by eyeless ministry?—
2864,MAY,She follows with the voices that invite.
2865,MAY,
2866,MAY,
2867,MAY,14
2868,MAY,
2869,MAY,"There being deliciously refresht, from soil"
2870,MAY,"Of earth made pure by water, fire, and air,"
2871,MAY,"They clad her in soft robes of Asian toil,"
2872,MAY,"Scented, that in her queenly wardrobe were;"
2873,MAY,"And led her forth to dine, and all around"
2874,MAY,"Sang as they served, the while a choral sound"
2875,MAY,Of strings unseen and reeds the burden bare.
2876,MAY,
2877,MAY,
2878,MAY,15
2879,MAY,
2880,MAY,"P athetic strains and passionate they wove,"
2881,MAY,U rgent in ecstasies of heavenly sense;
2882,MAY,"R esponsive rivalries, that, while they strove,"
2883,MAY,"C ombined in full harmonious suspense,"
2884,MAY,"E ntrancing wild desire, then fell at last"
2885,MAY,"L ull’d in soft closes, and with gay contrast"
2886,MAY,L aunch’d forth their fresh unwearied excellence.
2887,MAY,
2888,MAY,
2889,MAY,16
2890,MAY,
2891,MAY,"Now Psyche, when her twofold feast was o’er,"
2892,MAY,Would feed her eye; and choosing for her guide
2893,MAY,"A low-voiced singer, bade her come explore"
2894,MAY,The wondrous house; until on every side
2895,MAY,"As surfeited with beauty, and seeing nought"
2896,MAY,"But what was rich and fair beyond her thought,"
2897,MAY,"And all her own, thus to the voice she cried:"
2898,MAY,
2899,MAY,
2900,MAY,17
2901,MAY,
2902,MAY,"‘Am I indeed a goddess, or is this"
2903,MAY,But to be dead; and through the gates of death
2904,MAY,Passing unwittingly doth man not miss
2905,MAY,Body nor memory nor living breath;
2906,MAY,"Nor by demerits of his deeds is cast,"
2907,MAY,"But, paid with the desire he holdeth fast,"
2908,MAY,Is holp with all his heart imagineth?’
2909,MAY,
2910,MAY,
2911,MAY,18
2912,MAY,
2913,MAY,But her for all reply the wandering tongue
2914,MAY,"Call’d to the chamber where her bed was laid,"
2915,MAY,With flower’d broideries of linen hung:
2916,MAY,And round the walls in painting were portray’d
2917,MAY,Love’s victories over the gods renown’d.
2918,MAY,Ares and Aphrodite here lay bound
2919,MAY,In the fine net that dark Hephæstus made:
2920,MAY,
2921,MAY,
2922,MAY,19
2923,MAY,
2924,MAY,"Here Zeus, in likeness of a tawny bull,"
2925,MAY,"Stoop’d on the Cretan shore his mighty knee,"
2926,MAY,While off his back Europa beautiful
2927,MAY,Stept pale against the blue Carpathian sea;
2928,MAY,"And here Apollo, as he caught amazed"
2929,MAY,"Daphne, for lo! her hands shot forth upraised"
2930,MAY,"In leaves, her feet were rooted like a tree:"
2931,MAY,
2932,MAY,
2933,MAY,20
2934,MAY,
2935,MAY,"Here Dionysos, springing from his car"
2936,MAY,At sight of Ariadne; here uplept
2937,MAY,"Adonis to the chase, breaking the bar"
2938,MAY,Of Aphrodite’s arm for love who wept:
2939,MAY,"He spear in hand, with leashèd dogs at strain;"
2940,MAY,A marvellous work. But Psyche soon grown fain
2941,MAY,"Of rest, betook her to her bed and slept."
2942,MAY,
2943,MAY,
2944,MAY,21
2945,MAY,
2946,MAY,"Nor long had slept, when at a sudden stir"
2947,MAY,"She woke; and one, that thro’ the dark made way,"
2948,MAY,"Drew near, and stood beside; and over her"
2949,MAY,"The curtain rustl’d. Trembling now she lay,"
2950,MAY,Fainting with terror: till upon her face
2951,MAY,"A kiss, and with two gentle arms’ embrace,"
2952,MAY,A voice that call’d her name in loving play.
2953,MAY,
2954,MAY,
2955,MAY,22
2956,MAY,
2957,MAY,"Though for the darkness she coud nothing see,"
2958,MAY,She wish’d not then for what the night denied:
2959,MAY,"This was the lover she had lack’d, and she,"
2960,MAY,"Loving his loving, was his willing bride."
2961,MAY,"O’erjoy’d she slept again, o’erjoy’d awoke"
2962,MAY,At break of morn upon her love to look;
2963,MAY,When lo! his empty place lay by her side.
2964,MAY,
2965,MAY,
2966,MAY,23
2967,MAY,
2968,MAY,So all that day she spent in company
2969,MAY,"Of the soft voices; and Of right, they said,"
2970,MAY,Art thou our Lady now. Be happily
2971,MAY,Thy bridal morrow by thy servants sped.
2972,MAY,"But she but long’d for night, if that might bring"
2973,MAY,Her lover back; and he on secret wing
2974,MAY,"Came with the dark, and in the darkness fled."
2975,MAY,
2976,MAY,
2977,MAY,24
2978,MAY,
2979,MAY,And this was all her life; for every night
2980,MAY,"He came, and though his name she never learn’d,"
2981,MAY,Nor was his image yielded to her sight
2982,MAY,"At morn or eve, she neither look’d nor yearn’d"
2983,MAY,Beyond her happiness: and custom brought
2984,MAY,An ease to pleasure; nor would Psyche’s thought
2985,MAY,"Have ever to her earthly home return’d,"
2986,MAY,
2987,MAY,
2988,MAY,25
2989,MAY,
2990,MAY,"But that one night he said ‘Psyche, my soul,"
2991,MAY,Sad danger threatens us: thy sisters twain
2992,MAY,"Come to the mountain top, whence I thee stole,"
2993,MAY,And thou wilt hear their voices thence complain.
2994,MAY,Answer them not: for it must end our love
2995,MAY,If they should hear or spy thee from above.’
2996,MAY,And Psyche said ‘Their cry shall be in vain.’
2997,MAY,
2998,MAY,
2999,MAY,26
3000,MAY,
3001,MAY,"But being again alone, she thought ’twas hard"
3002,MAY,On her own blood; and blamed her joy as thief
3003,MAY,"Of theirs, her comfort which their comfort barr’d;"
3004,MAY,When she their care might be their care’s relief.
3005,MAY,"All day she brooded on her father’s woe,"
3006,MAY,"And when at night her lover kisst her, lo!"
3007,MAY,Her tender face was wet with tears of grief.
3008,MAY,
3009,MAY,
3010,MAY,27
3011,MAY,
3012,MAY,"Then question’d why she wept, she all confest;"
3013,MAY,And begg’d of him she might but once go nigh
3014,MAY,To set her sire’s and sisters’ fears at rest;
3015,MAY,Till he for pity coud not but comply:
3016,MAY,‘Only if they should ask thee of thy love
3017,MAY,Discover nothing to their ears above.’
3018,MAY,And Psyche said ‘In vain shall be their cry.’
3019,MAY,
3020,MAY,
3021,MAY,28
3022,MAY,
3023,MAY,"And yet with day no sooner was alone,"
3024,MAY,Than she for loneliness her promise rued:
3025,MAY,"That having so much pleasure for her own,"
3026,MAY,’Twas all unshared and spent in solitude.
3027,MAY,"And when at night her love flew to his place,"
3028,MAY,"More than afore she shamed his fond embrace,"
3029,MAY,And piteously with tears her plaint renew’d.
3030,MAY,
3031,MAY,
3032,MAY,29
3033,MAY,
3034,MAY,"The more he now denied, the more she wept;"
3035,MAY,"Nor would in anywise be comforted,"
3036,MAY,"Unless her sisters, on the Zephyr swept,"
3037,MAY,"Should in those halls be one day bathed and fed,"
3038,MAY,And see themselves the palace where she reign’d.
3039,MAY,"And he by force of tears at last constrain’d,"
3040,MAY,"Granted her wish unwillingly, and said:"
3041,MAY,
3042,MAY,
3043,MAY,30
3044,MAY,
3045,MAY,‘Much to our peril hast thou won thy will;
3046,MAY,"Thy sisters’ love, seeing thee honour’d so,"
3047,MAY,"Will sour to envy, and with jealous skill"
3048,MAY,Will pry to learn the thing that none may know.
3049,MAY,"Answer not, nor inquire; for know that I"
3050,MAY,"The day thou seest my face far hence shall fly,"
3051,MAY,And thou anew to bitterest fate must go.’
3052,MAY,
3053,MAY,
3054,MAY,31
3055,MAY,
3056,MAY,"But Psyche said, ‘Thy love is more than life;"
3057,MAY,To have thee leaveth nothing to be won:
3058,MAY,For should the noonday prove me to be wife
3059,MAY,"Even of the beauteous Eros, who is son"
3060,MAY,"Of Cypris, I coud never love thee more.’"
3061,MAY,"Whereat he fondly kisst her o’er and o’er,"
3062,MAY,And peace was ’twixt them till the night was done.

3084,JUNE,
3085,JUNE,And truly need there was to the old King
3086,JUNE,For consolation: since the mournful day
3087,JUNE,"Of Psyche’s fate he took no comforting,"
3088,JUNE,But only for a speedy death would pray;
3089,JUNE,And on his head his hair grew silver-white.
3090,JUNE,"--Such on life’s topmost bough is sorrow’s blight,"
3091,JUNE,When the stout heart is cankering to decay.
3092,JUNE,
3093,JUNE,
3094,JUNE,2
3095,JUNE,
3096,JUNE,"Which when his daughters learnt, they both were quick"
3097,JUNE,Comfort and solace to their sire to lend.
3098,JUNE,But as not seldom they who nurse the sick
3099,JUNE,"Will take the malady from them they tend,"
3100,JUNE,So happ’d it now; for they who fail’d to cheer
3101,JUNE,"Grew sad themselves, and in that palace drear"
3102,JUNE,Increased the evil that they came to mend.
3103,JUNE,
3104,JUNE,
3105,JUNE,3
3106,JUNE,
3107,JUNE,And them the unhappy father sent to seek
3108,JUNE,"Where Psyche had been left, if they might find"
3109,JUNE,What monster held her on the savage peak;
3110,JUNE,"Or if she there had died of hunger pined,"
3111,JUNE,"And, by wild eagles stript, her scatter’d bones"
3112,JUNE,Might still be gather’d from the barren stones;
3113,JUNE,Or if her fate had left no trace behind.
3114,JUNE,
3115,JUNE,
3116,JUNE,4
3117,JUNE,
3118,JUNE,So just upon this time her sisters both
3119,JUNE,Climb’d on the cliff that hung o’er Psyche’s vale;
3120,JUNE,"And finding there no sign, to leave were loth"
3121,JUNE,Ere well assured she lurk’d not within hail.
3122,JUNE,"So calling loud her name, ‘Psyche!’ they cried,"
3123,JUNE,"‘Psyche, O Psyche!’ and when none replied"
3124,JUNE,They sank upon the rocks to weep and wail.
3125,JUNE,
3126,JUNE,
3127,JUNE,5
3128,JUNE,
3129,JUNE,"But Psyche heard their voices where she sat,"
3130,JUNE,And summoning the Zephyr bade him fleet
3131,JUNE,Those mourners down unto the grassy plat
3132,JUNE,"’Midst of her garden, where she had her seat."
3133,JUNE,Then from the dizzy steep the wondering pair
3134,JUNE,"Came swiftly sinking on his buoyant air,"
3135,JUNE,And stood upon the terrace at her feet.
3136,JUNE,
3137,JUNE,
3138,JUNE,6
3139,JUNE,
3140,JUNE,"Upsprang she then, and kiss’d them and embraced,"
3141,JUNE,"And said ‘Lo, here am I, I whom ye mourn."
3142,JUNE,"I am not dead, nor tortured, nor disgraced,"
3143,JUNE,But blest above all days since I was born:
3144,JUNE,Wherefore be glad. Enter my home and see
3145,JUNE,"How little cause has been to grieve for me,"
3146,JUNE,And my desertion on the rocks forlorn.’
3147,JUNE,
3148,JUNE,
3149,JUNE,7
3150,JUNE,
3151,JUNE,"So entering by the golden gate, or e’er"
3152,JUNE,"The marvel of their hither flight had waned,"
3153,JUNE,"Fresh wonder took them now, for everywhere"
3154,JUNE,Their eyes that lit on beauty were enchain’d;
3155,JUNE,"And Psyche’s airy service, as she bade,"
3156,JUNE,"Perform’d its magic office, and display’d"
3157,JUNE,The riches of the palace where she reign’d.
3158,JUNE,
3159,JUNE,
3160,JUNE,8
3161,JUNE,
3162,JUNE,"And through the perfumed chambers they were led,"
3163,JUNE,"And bathed therein; and after, set to sup,"
3164,JUNE,"Were upon dreamlike delicacies fed,"
3165,JUNE,And wine more precious than its golden cup.
3166,JUNE,"Till seeing nothing lack’d and naught was theirs,"
3167,JUNE,"Their happiness fell from them unawares,"
3168,JUNE,And bitter envy in their hearts sprang up.
3169,JUNE,
3170,JUNE,
3171,JUNE,9
3172,JUNE,
3173,JUNE,"At last one said ‘Psyche, since not alone"
3174,JUNE,"Thou livest here in joy, as well we wot,"
3175,JUNE,"Who is the man who should these wonders own,"
3176,JUNE,"Or god, I say, and still appeareth not?"
3177,JUNE,"What is his name? What rank and guise hath he,"
3178,JUNE,"Whom winds and spirits serve, who honoureth thee"
3179,JUNE,Above all others in thy blissful lot?’
3180,JUNE,
3181,JUNE,
3182,JUNE,10
3183,JUNE,
3184,JUNE,But Psyche when that wistful speech she heard
3185,JUNE,Was ware of all her spouse had warn’d her of:
3186,JUNE,"And uttering a disingenuous word,"
3187,JUNE,Said ‘A youth yet unbearded is my love;
3188,JUNE,"He goeth hunting on the plains to-day,"
3189,JUNE,And with his dogs hath wander’d far away;
3190,JUNE,And not till eve can he return above.’

3192,JUNE,
3193,JUNE,11
3194,JUNE,
3195,JUNE,"Then fearing to be nearer plied, she rose"
3196,JUNE,"And brought her richest jewels one by one,"
3197,JUNE,Bidding them choose and take whate’er they chose;
3198,JUNE,And beckoning the Zephyr spake anon
3199,JUNE,That he should waft her sisters to the peak;
3200,JUNE,"The which he did, and, ere they more coud speak,"
3201,JUNE,"They rose on high, and in the wind were gone."
3202,JUNE,
3203,JUNE,
3204,JUNE,12
3205,JUNE,
3206,JUNE,"Nor till again they came upon the road,"
3207,JUNE,Which from the mountain shoulder o’er the plain
3208,JUNE,"Led to the city of their sire’s abode,"
3209,JUNE,"Found they their tongues, though full of high disdain"
3210,JUNE,"Their hearts were, but kept silence, till the strength"
3211,JUNE,Of pride and envious hatred burst at length
3212,JUNE,"In voice, and thus the elder gan complain:"
3213,JUNE,
3214,JUNE,
3215,JUNE,13
3216,JUNE,
3217,JUNE,‘Cruel and unjust fortune! that of three
3218,JUNE,"Sisters, whose being from one fountain well’d,"
3219,JUNE,"Exalts the last so high from her degree,"
3220,JUNE,And leaves the first to be so far excel’d.
3221,JUNE,My husband is a poor and niggard churl
3222,JUNE,"To him, whoe’er he be, that loves the girl."
3223,JUNE,Oh! in what godlike state her house is held!’
3224,JUNE,
3225,JUNE,
3226,JUNE,14
3227,JUNE,
3228,JUNE,"‘Ay,’ said the other, ‘to a gouty loon"
3229,JUNE,Am I not wedded? Lo! thy hurt is mine:
3230,JUNE,"But never call me woman more, if soon"
3231,JUNE,I cannot lure her from her height divine.
3232,JUNE,"Nay, she shall need her cunning wit to save"
3233,JUNE,The wealth of which so grudgingly she gave;
3234,JUNE,Wherefore thy hand and heart with me combine.
3235,JUNE,
3236,JUNE,
3237,JUNE,15
3238,JUNE,
3239,JUNE,"‘She but received us out of pride, to show"
3240,JUNE,"Her state, well deeming that her happiness"
3241,JUNE,Was little worth while there was none to know;
3242,JUNE,So is our lot uninjured if none guess.
3243,JUNE,"Reveal we nothing therefore, but the while"
3244,JUNE,"Together scheme this wanton to beguile,"
3245,JUNE,And bring her boasting godhead to distress.’
3246,JUNE,
3247,JUNE,
3248,JUNE,16
3249,JUNE,
3250,JUNE,"So fresh disordering their dress and hair,"
3251,JUNE,"With loud lament they to their sire return,"
3252,JUNE,"Telling they found not Psyche anywhere,"
3253,JUNE,And of her sure mischance could nothing learn:
3254,JUNE,"And with that lie the wounded man they slew,"
3255,JUNE,Hiding the saving truth which well they knew;
3256,JUNE,Nor did his piteous grief their heart concern.
3257,JUNE,
3258,JUNE,
3259,JUNE,17
3260,JUNE,
3261,JUNE,Meanwhile her unknown lover did not cease
3262,JUNE,To warn poor Psyche how her sisters plan’d
3263,JUNE,To undermine her love and joy and peace;
3264,JUNE,"And urged how well she might their wiles withstand,"
3265,JUNE,By keeping them from her delight aloof:
3266,JUNE,"For better is security than proof,"
3267,JUNE,And malice held afar than near at hand.
3268,JUNE,
3269,JUNE,
3270,JUNE,18
3271,JUNE,
3272,JUNE,"‘And, dearest wife,’ he said, ‘since ’tis not long"
3273,JUNE,"Ere one will come to share thy secrecy,"
3274,JUNE,And be thy babe and mine; let nothing wrong
3275,JUNE,The happy months of thy maternity.
3276,JUNE,"If thou keep trust, then shalt thou see thy child"
3277,JUNE,"A god; but if to pry thou be beguiled,"
3278,JUNE,The lot of both is death and misery.’
3279,JUNE,
3280,JUNE,
3281,JUNE,19
3282,JUNE,
3283,JUNE,"Then Psyche’s simple heart was fill’d with joy,"
3284,JUNE,"And counting to herself the months and days,"
3285,JUNE,"Look’d for the time, when she should bear a boy"
3286,JUNE,To be her growing stay and godlike praise.
3287,JUNE,"And ‘O be sure,’ she said, ‘be sure, my pride"
3288,JUNE,"Having so rich a promise cannot slide,"
3289,JUNE,Even if my love coud fail which thee obeys.’
3290,JUNE,
3291,JUNE,
3292,JUNE,20
3293,JUNE,
3294,JUNE,"And so most happily her life went by,"
3295,JUNE,In thoughts of love dear to her new estate;
3296,JUNE,"Until at length the evil day drew nigh,"
3297,JUNE,"When now her sisters, joined in jealous hate,"
3298,JUNE,"Set forth again, and plotted by the way"
3299,JUNE,How they might best allure her to betray
3300,JUNE,Her secret; with what lie their angle bait.
3301,JUNE,
3302,JUNE,
3303,JUNE,21
3304,JUNE,
3305,JUNE,"That night her husband spake to her, and said"
3306,JUNE,"‘Psyche, thy sisters come: and when they climb"
3307,JUNE,The peak they will not tarry to be sped
3308,JUNE,"Down by the Zephyr, as that other time,"
3309,JUNE,But winging to the wind will cast themselves
3310,JUNE,"Out in the air, and on the rocky shelves"
3311,JUNE,"Be dasht, and pay the penalty of crime."
3312,JUNE,
3313,JUNE,
3314,JUNE,22
3315,JUNE,
3316,JUNE,"‘So let it be, and so shall we be saved.’"
3317,JUNE,Which meditated vengeance of his fear
3318,JUNE,"When Psyche heard, now for their life she craved,"
3319,JUNE,Whose mere distress erewhile had toucht her near.
3320,JUNE,"Around her lover’s neck her arms she threw,"
3321,JUNE,"And pleaded for them by her faith so true,"
3322,JUNE,Although they went on doom in judgment clear.
3323,JUNE,
3324,JUNE,
3325,JUNE,23
3326,JUNE,
3327,JUNE,In terror of bloodguiltiness she now
3328,JUNE,Forgot all other danger; she adjured;
3329,JUNE,Or using playfulness deep sobs would plow
3330,JUNE,"Her soft entreaties, not to be endured:"
3331,JUNE,Till he at last was fain once more to grant
3332,JUNE,"The service of the Zephyr, to enchant"
3333,JUNE,That wicked couple from their fate assured.
3334,JUNE,
3335,JUNE,
3336,JUNE,24
3337,JUNE,
3338,JUNE,So ere ’twas noon were noises at the door
3339,JUNE,Of knocking loud and voices high in glee;
3340,JUNE,Such as within that vale never before
3341,JUNE,"Had been, and now seem’d most unmeet to be."
3342,JUNE,"And Psyche blush’d, though being alone, and rose"
3343,JUNE,To meet her sisters and herself unclose
3344,JUNE,The gate that made them of her palace free.
3345,JUNE,
3346,JUNE,
3347,JUNE,25
3348,JUNE,
3349,JUNE,"Fondly she kiss’d them, and with kindly cheer"
3350,JUNE,Sought to amuse; and they with outward smile
3351,JUNE,"O’ermask’d their hate, and called her sweet and dear,"
3352,JUNE,Finding affection easy to beguile:
3353,JUNE,"And all was smooth, until at last one said"
3354,JUNE,"‘Tell us, I pray, to whom ’tis thou art wed;"
3355,JUNE,"’Mong gods or men, what is his rank and style?"
3356,JUNE,
3357,JUNE,
3358,JUNE,26
3359,JUNE,
3360,JUNE,"‘Thou canst not think to hide the truth from us,"
3361,JUNE,"Who knew thy peevish sorrows when a maid,"
3362,JUNE,"And see thee now so glad and rapturous,"
3363,JUNE,As changed from what thou wert as light from shade;
3364,JUNE,"Thy jewels, too, the palace of a king,"
3365,JUNE,"Nor least the serviceable spiriting,"
3366,JUNE,By everything thy secret is betray’d:
3367,JUNE,
3368,JUNE,
3369,JUNE,27
3370,JUNE,
3371,JUNE,‘And yet thou talkest of thy wondrous man
3372,JUNE,No more than if his face thou didst not know.’
3373,JUNE,"At which incontinently she began,"
3374,JUNE,"Forgetful of her word a month ago,"
3375,JUNE,"Answering ‘A merchant rich, of middle age,"
3376,JUNE,My husband is; and o’er his features sage
3377,JUNE,His temples are already touch’d with snow.
3378,JUNE,
3379,JUNE,
3380,JUNE,28
3381,JUNE,
3382,JUNE,‘But ’gainst his wish since hither ye were brought
3383,JUNE,’Twere best depart.’ Then her accustom’d spell
3384,JUNE,Sped them upon the summit quick as thought;
3385,JUNE,And being alone her doing pleased her well:
3386,JUNE,So was she vext to find her love at night
3387,JUNE,"More sad than ever, of her sisters’ spite"
3388,JUNE,Speaking as one that coud the end foretell.
3389,JUNE,
3390,JUNE,
3391,JUNE,29
3392,JUNE,
3393,JUNE,"‘And ere long,’ said he, ‘they will spy again:"
3394,JUNE,Let them be dash’d upon the rocks and die;
3395,JUNE,"’Tis they must come to death or thou to pain,"
3396,JUNE,"To separation, Psyche, thou and I;"
3397,JUNE,"Nay, and our babe to ill. I therefore crave"
3398,JUNE,"Thou wilt not even once more these vipers save,"
3399,JUNE,Nor to thy love his only boon deny.’
3400,JUNE,
3401,JUNE,
3402,JUNE,30
3403,JUNE,
3404,JUNE,But Psyche would not think her sisters’ crime
3405,JUNE,"So gross and strange, nor coud her danger see;"
3406,JUNE,"Since ’twere so easy, if at any time"
3407,JUNE,"They show’d the venom of their hearts, that she"
3408,JUNE,Should fan them off upon the willing gust.
3409,JUNE,"So she refused, and claiming truer trust,"
3410,JUNE,Would in no wise unto their death agree.
3411,JUNE,
3412,JUNE,
3413,JUNE,
3414,JUNE,
3415,JULY,JULY
3416,JULY,
3417,JULY,
3418,JULY,1
3419,JULY,
3420,JULY,"‘What think you, sister:’ thus one envious fiend"
3421,JULY,"To other spake upon their homeward route,"
3422,JULY,‘What of the story that our wit hath glean’d
3423,JULY,"Of this mysterious lover, who can shoot"
3424,JULY,"In thirty days from beardless youth to prime,"
3425,JULY,"With wisdom in his face before his time,"
3426,JULY,And snowy locks upon his head to boot?’
3427,JULY,
3428,JULY,
3429,JULY,2
3430,JULY,
3431,JULY,"‘Ay,’ said the other, ‘true, she lied not well;"
3432,JULY,And thence I gather knows no more than we:
3433,JULY,For surely ’tis a spirit insensible
3434,JULY,"To whom she is wedded, one she cannot see."
3435,JULY,"’Tis that I fear; for if ’tis so, her child"
3436,JULY,"Will be a god, and she a goddess styled,"
3437,JULY,"Which, though I die to let it, shall not be."
3438,JULY,
3439,JULY,
3440,JULY,3
3441,JULY,
3442,JULY,"‘Lament we thus no longer. Come, consult"
3443,JULY,"What may be done.’ And home they came at night,"
3444,JULY,"Yet not to rest, but of their plots occult"
3445,JULY,Sat whispering on their beds; and ere ’twas light
3446,JULY,Resolving on the deed coud not defer;
3447,JULY,"But roused the sleeping house with sudden stir,"
3448,JULY,And sallied forth alone to work their spite.
3449,JULY,
3450,JULY,
3451,JULY,4
3452,JULY,
3453,JULY,"And with the noon were climb’d upon the peak,"
3454,JULY,And swam down on the Zephyr as before;
3455,JULY,But now with piercing cry and doleful shriek
3456,JULY,"They force their entrance through the golden door,"
3457,JULY,Feigning the urgency of bitter truth;
3458,JULY,"Such as deforms a friendly face with ruth,"
3459,JULY,When kindness may not hide ill tidings more.
3460,JULY,
3461,JULY,
3462,JULY,5
3463,JULY,
3464,JULY,"Then Psyche when she heard their wailful din,"
3465,JULY,And saw their countenances wan and worn
3466,JULY,"With travel, vigil, and disfiguring sin,"
3467,JULY,"Their hair dishevel’d and their habits torn,"
3468,JULY,For trembling scarce could ask what ill had hapt;
3469,JULY,"And they alert with joy to see her trapt,"
3470,JULY,"Launch’d forth amain, and on their drift were borne."
3471,JULY,
3472,JULY,
3473,JULY,6
3474,JULY,
3475,JULY,"‘O Psyche, happiest certainly and blest"
3476,JULY,"Up to this hour,’ they said, ‘thou surely wert,"
3477,JULY,Being of thy fearful peril unpossest;
3478,JULY,Which now we would not tell but to avert.
3479,JULY,But we in solemn truth thy spouse have found
3480,JULY,"To be the dragon of this mountain ground,"
3481,JULY,Who holds thee here to work thy shame and hurt.
3482,JULY,
3483,JULY,
3484,JULY,7
3485,JULY,
3486,JULY,‘As yesternight we rode upon the wind
3487,JULY,He issued to pursue us from the wood;
3488,JULY,"We saw his back, that through the tree-tops finn’d,"
3489,JULY,His fiery eyes glared from their wrinkl’d hood.
3490,JULY,"Lo, now betimes the oracle, which said"
3491,JULY,"How to the savage beast thou shouldst be wed,"
3492,JULY,Is plainly for thy safety understood.
3493,JULY,
3494,JULY,
3495,JULY,8
3496,JULY,
3497,JULY,‘Long time hath he been known to all that dwell
3498,JULY,Upon the plain; but now his secret lair
3499,JULY,"Have we discover’d, which none else coud tell:"
3500,JULY,Though many women fallen in his snare
3501,JULY,"Hath he enchanted; who, tradition saith,"
3502,JULY,"Taste love awhile, ere to their cruel death"
3503,JULY,They pass in turn upon the summits bare.
3504,JULY,
3505,JULY,
3506,JULY,9
3507,JULY,
3508,JULY,‘Fly with us while thou mayst: no more delay;
3509,JULY,Renounce the spells of this accursed vale.
3510,JULY,"We come to save thee, but we dare not stay;"
3511,JULY,Among these sightless spirits our senses quail.
3512,JULY,"Fly with us, fly!’ Then Psyche, for her soul"
3513,JULY,"Was soft and simple, lost her self-control,"
3514,JULY,"And, thinking only of the horrid tale,"
3515,JULY,
3516,JULY,
3517,JULY,10
3518,JULY,
3519,JULY,"‘Dear sisters,’ said she, and her sobbing speech"
3520,JULY,"Was broken by her terror, ‘it is true"
3521,JULY,That much hath hapt to stablish what ye teach;
3522,JULY,For ne’er hath it been granted me to view
3523,JULY,"My husband; and, for aught I know, he may"
3524,JULY,"Be even that cruel dragon, which ye say"
3525,JULY,Peer’d at you from the forest to pursue.
3526,JULY,
3527,JULY,
3528,JULY,11
3529,JULY,
3530,JULY,‘’Tis sure that scarcely can I win his grace
3531,JULY,To see you here; and still he mischief vows
3532,JULY,"If ever I should ask to see his face,"
3533,JULY,"Which, coming in the dark, he ne’er allows."
3534,JULY,"Therefore, if ye can help, of pity show,"
3535,JULY,"Since doubt I must, how I may come to know"
3536,JULY,What kind of spirit it is that is my spouse.’
3537,JULY,
3538,JULY,
3539,JULY,12
3540,JULY,
3541,JULY,Then to her cue the younger was afore:
3542,JULY,"‘Hide thou a razor,’ cried she, ‘near thy bed;"
3543,JULY,"And have a lamp prepared, but whelm thereo’er"
3544,JULY,"Some cover, that no light be from it shed."
3545,JULY,"And when securely in first sleep he lies,"
3546,JULY,"Look on him well, and ere he can arise,"
3547,JULY,"Gashing his throat, cut off his hideous head.’"
3548,JULY,
3549,JULY,
3550,JULY,13
3551,JULY,
3552,JULY,"Which both persuading, off they flew content,"
3553,JULY,Divining that whate’er she was forbid
3554,JULY,"Was by her lover for her safety meant,"
3555,JULY,Which only coud be sure while he was hid.
3556,JULY,"But Psyche, to that miserable deed"
3557,JULY,"Being now already in her mind agreed,"
3558,JULY,"Wander’d alone, and knew not what she did."
3559,JULY,
3560,JULY,
3561,JULY,14
3562,JULY,
3563,JULY,"Now she would trust her lover, now in turn"
3564,JULY,Made question of his bidding as unjust;
3565,JULY,But thirsting curiosity to learn
3566,JULY,"His secret overcame her simple trust,"
3567,JULY,"O’ercame her spoken troth, o’ercame her fear;"
3568,JULY,"And she prepared, as now the hour drew near,"
3569,JULY,"The mean contrivances, nor felt disgust."
3570,JULY,
3571,JULY,
3572,JULY,15
3573,JULY,
3574,JULY,"She set the lamp beneath a chair, and cloked"
3575,JULY,Thickly its rebel lustre from the eye:
3576,JULY,"And laid the knife, to mortal keenness stroked,"
3577,JULY,"Within her reach, where she was wont to lie:"
3578,JULY,And took her place full early; but her heart
3579,JULY,"Beat fast, and stay’d her breath with sudden start,"
3580,JULY,Feeling her lover’s arm laid fond thereby.
3581,JULY,
3582,JULY,
3583,JULY,16
3584,JULY,
3585,JULY,"But when at last he slept, then she arose,"
3586,JULY,All faint and tremulous: and though it be
3587,JULY,That wrong betrayeth innocence with shews
3588,JULY,"Of novelty, its guilt from shame to free,"
3589,JULY,Yet ’twas for shame her hand so strangely shook
3590,JULY,"That held the steel, and from the cloke that took"
3591,JULY,"The lamp, and raised it o’er the bed to see."
3592,JULY,
3593,JULY,
3594,JULY,17
3595,JULY,
3596,JULY,She had some fear she might not well discern
3597,JULY,By that small flame a monster in the gloom;
3598,JULY,"When lo! the air about her seem’d to burn,"
3599,JULY,And bright celestial radiance fill’d the room.
3600,JULY,"Too plainly O she saw, O fair to see!"
3601,JULY,"Eros, ’twas Eros’ self, her lover, he,"
3602,JULY,"The God of love, reveal’d in deathless bloom."
3603,JULY,
3604,JULY,
3605,JULY,18
3606,JULY,
3607,JULY,Her fainting strength forsook her; on her knees
3608,JULY,Down by the bed she sank; the shameless knife
3609,JULY,"Fell flashing, and her heart took thought to seize"
3610,JULY,"Its desperate haft, and end her wicked life."
3611,JULY,Yet coud she not her loving eyes withdraw
3612,JULY,"From her fair sleeping lover, whom she saw"
3613,JULY,Only to know she was no more his wife.
3614,JULY,
3615,JULY,
3616,JULY,19
3617,JULY,
3618,JULY,"O treasure of all treasures, late her own!"
3619,JULY,"O loss above all losses, lost for aye!"
3620,JULY,Since there was no repentance coud atone
3621,JULY,"For her dishonour, nor her fate withstay."
3622,JULY,But yet ’twas joy to have her love in sight;
3623,JULY,"And, to the rapture yielding while she might,"
3624,JULY,She gazed upon his body where he lay.
3625,JULY,
3626,JULY,
3627,JULY,20
3628,JULY,
3629,JULY,"Above all mortal beauty, as was hers,"
3630,JULY,She saw a rival; but if passion’s heart
3631,JULY,"Be rightly read by subtle questioners,"
3632,JULY,It owns a wanton and a gentler part.
3633,JULY,"And Psyche wonder’d, noting every sign"
3634,JULY,"By which the immortal God, her spouse divine,"
3635,JULY,Betray’d the image of our earthly art;
3636,JULY,
3637,JULY,
3638,JULY,21
3639,JULY,
3640,JULY,"His thickly curling hair, his ruddy cheeks,"
3641,JULY,"And pouting lips, his soft and dimpl’d chin,"
3642,JULY,"The full and cushion’d eye, that idly speaks"
3643,JULY,"Of self-content and vanity within,"
3644,JULY,"The forward, froward ear, and smooth to touch"
3645,JULY,"His body sleek, but rounded overmuch"
3646,JULY,For dignity of mind and pride akin.
3647,JULY,
3648,JULY,
3649,JULY,22
3650,JULY,
3651,JULY,"She noted that the small irradiant wings,"
3652,JULY,"That from his shoulders lay along at rest,"
3653,JULY,"Were yet disturb’d with airy quiverings,"
3654,JULY,As if some wakeful spirit his blood possest;
3655,JULY,"She feared he was awaking, but they kept"
3656,JULY,"Their sweet commotion still, and still he slept,"
3657,JULY,And still she gazed with never-tiring zest.
3658,JULY,
3659,JULY,
3660,JULY,23
3661,JULY,
3662,JULY,And now the colour of her pride and joy
3663,JULY,"Outflush’d the hue of Eros; she, so cold,"
3664,JULY,"To have fired the passion of the heartless boy,"
3665,JULY,Whom none in heaven or earth were found to hold!
3666,JULY,"Psyche, the earthborn, to be prized above"
3667,JULY,"The heavenly Graces by the God of love,"
3668,JULY,And worshipt by his wantonness untold!
3669,JULY,
3670,JULY,
3671,JULY,24
3672,JULY,
3673,JULY,"Nay, for that very thing she loved him more,"
3674,JULY,More than herself her sweet self’s complement:
3675,JULY,Until the sight of him again upbore
3676,JULY,"Her courage, and renew’d her vigour spent."
3677,JULY,"And looking now around, she first espied"
3678,JULY,"Where at the bed’s foot, cast in haste aside,"
3679,JULY,"Lay his full quiver, and his bow unbent."
3680,JULY,
3681,JULY,
3682,JULY,25
3683,JULY,
3684,JULY,"One of those darts, of which she had heard so oft,"
3685,JULY,She took to try if ’twas so very keen;
3686,JULY,And held its point against her finger soft
3687,JULY,"So gently, that to touch it scarce was seen;"
3688,JULY,"Yet was she sharply prickt, and felt the fire"
3689,JULY,Run through her veins; and now a strange desire
3690,JULY,"Troubl’d her heart, which ne’er before had been:"
3691,JULY,
3692,JULY,
3693,JULY,26
3694,JULY,
3695,JULY,"Straight sprang she to her lover on the bed,"
3696,JULY,"And kisst his cheek, and was not satisfied:"
3697,JULY,"When, O the lamp, held ill-balanced o’erhead,"
3698,JULY,One drop of burning oil spill’d from its side
3699,JULY,"On Eros’ naked shoulder as he slept,"
3700,JULY,Who waken’d by the sudden smart uplept
3701,JULY,"Upon the floor, and all the mischief eyed."
3702,JULY,
3703,JULY,
3704,JULY,27
3705,JULY,
3706,JULY,"With nervous speed he seized his bow, and past"
3707,JULY,Out of the guilty chamber at a bound;
3708,JULY,"But Psyche, following his flight as fast,"
3709,JULY,"Caught him, and crying threw her arms around:"
3710,JULY,Till coming to the court he rose in air;
3711,JULY,"And she, close clinging in her last despair,"
3712,JULY,"Was dragg’d, and then lost hold and fell to ground."
3713,JULY,
3714,JULY,
3715,JULY,28
3716,JULY,
3717,JULY,"Wailing she fell; but he, upon the roof"
3718,JULY,"Staying his feet, awhile his flight delay’d:"
3719,JULY,And turning to her as he stood aloof
3720,JULY,"Beside a cypress, whose profoundest shade"
3721,JULY,Drank the reflections of the dreamy night
3722,JULY,"In its stiff pinnacle, the nimble light"
3723,JULY,Of million stars upon his body play’d:
3724,JULY,
3725,JULY,
3726,JULY,29
3727,JULY,
3728,JULY,"‘O simple-hearted Psyche,’ thus he spake,"
3729,JULY,"And she upraised her piteous eyes and hands,"
3730,JULY,"‘O simple-hearted Psyche, for thy sake"
3731,JULY,I dared to break my mother’s stern commands;
3732,JULY,And gave thee godlike marriage in the place
3733,JULY,"Of vilest shame; and, not to hurt thy grace,"
3734,JULY,"Spared thee my arrows, which no heart withstands."
3735,JULY,
3736,JULY,
3737,JULY,30
3738,JULY,
3739,JULY,"‘But thou, for doubt I was some evil beast,"
3740,JULY,"Hast mock’d the warnings of my love, to spy"
3741,JULY,"Upon my secret, which concern’d thee least,"
3742,JULY,Seeing that thy joy was never touch’d thereby.
3743,JULY,"By faithless prying thou hast work’d thy fall,"
3744,JULY,"And, even as I foretold thee, losest all"
3745,JULY,For looking on thy happiness too nigh:
3746,JULY,
3747,JULY,
3748,JULY,31
3749,JULY,
3750,JULY,‘Which loss may be thine ample punishment.
3751,JULY,"But to those fiends, by whom thou wert misled,"
3752,JULY,Go tell each one in turn that I have sent
3753,JULY,"This message, that I love her in thy stead;"
3754,JULY,And bid them by their love haste hither soon.’
3755,JULY,Whereat he fled; and Psyche in a swoon
3756,JULY,Fell back upon the marble floor as dead.
3757,JULY,
3758,JULY,
3759,JULY,
3760,JULY,
3761,AUGUST,AUGUST
3762,AUGUST,
3763,AUGUST,
3764,AUGUST,1
3765,AUGUST,
3766,AUGUST,When from the lowest ebbing of her blood
3767,AUGUST,"The fluttering pulses thrill’d and swell’d again,"
3768,AUGUST,Her stricken heart recovering force to flood
3769,AUGUST,"With life the sunken conduits of her brain,"
3770,AUGUST,"Then Psyche, where she had fallen, numb and cold"
3771,AUGUST,"Arose, but scarce her quaking sense control’d,"
3772,AUGUST,Seeing the couch where she that night had lain.
3773,AUGUST,
3774,AUGUST,
3775,AUGUST,2
3776,AUGUST,
3777,AUGUST,The level sunbeams search’d the grassy ground
3778,AUGUST,For diamond dewdrops. Ah! was this the place?
3779,AUGUST,"Where was the court, her home? she look’d around"
3780,AUGUST,And question’d with her memory for a space.
3781,AUGUST,"There was the cypress, there the well-known wood,"
3782,AUGUST,"That wall’d the spot: ’twas here her palace stood,"
3783,AUGUST,As surely as ’twas vanish’d without trace.
3784,AUGUST,
3785,AUGUST,
3786,AUGUST,3
3787,AUGUST,
3788,AUGUST,Was all a dream? To think that all was dreamt
3789,AUGUST,Were now the happier thought; but arguing o’er
3790,AUGUST,"That dream it was, she fell from her attempt,"
3791,AUGUST,Feeling the wifely burden that she bore.
3792,AUGUST,"Nay, true, ’twas true. She had had all and lost;"
3793,AUGUST,"The joy, the reckless wrong, the heavy cost"
3794,AUGUST,"Were hers, the dead end now, and woe in store."
3795,AUGUST,
3796,AUGUST,
3797,AUGUST,4
3798,AUGUST,
3799,AUGUST,What to be done? Fainting and shelterless
3800,AUGUST,Upon the mountain it were death to bide:
3801,AUGUST,"And harbour knew she none, where her distress"
3802,AUGUST,"Might comfort find, or love’s dishonour hide;"
3803,AUGUST,Nor felt she any dread like that of home:
3804,AUGUST,"Yet forth she must, albeit to rove and roam"
3805,AUGUST,An outcast o’er the country far and wide.
3806,AUGUST,
3807,AUGUST,
3808,AUGUST,5
3809,AUGUST,
3810,AUGUST,Anon she marvel’d noting from the vale
3811,AUGUST,"A path lead downward to the plain below,"
3812,AUGUST,"Crossing the very site, whereon the pale"
3813,AUGUST,Of all her joy had stood few hours ago;
3814,AUGUST,"A run of mountain beasts, that keep their track"
3815,AUGUST,"Through generations, and for ages back"
3816,AUGUST,Had trod the self-same footing to and fro.
3817,AUGUST,
3818,AUGUST,
3819,AUGUST,6
3820,AUGUST,
3821,AUGUST,"That would she try: so forth she took her way,"
3822,AUGUST,"Turning her face from the dishonour’d dell,"
3823,AUGUST,"Adown the broadening eastward lawns, which lay"
3824,AUGUST,"In gentle slant, till suddenly they fell"
3825,AUGUST,"In sheer cliff; whence the path that went around,"
3826,AUGUST,"Clomb by the bluffs, or e’er it downward wound"
3827,AUGUST,Beneath that precipice impassable.
3828,AUGUST,
3829,AUGUST,
3830,AUGUST,7
3831,AUGUST,
3832,AUGUST,"There once she turn’d, and gazing up the slope"
3833,AUGUST,She bid the scene of all her joy adieu;
3834,AUGUST,"‘Ay, and farewell,’ she cried, ‘farewell to hope,"
3835,AUGUST,"Since there is none will rescue me anew,"
3836,AUGUST,Who have kill’d God’s perfection with a doubt.’
3837,AUGUST,"Which said, she took the path that led about,"
3838,AUGUST,And hid the upland pleasance from her view.
3839,AUGUST,
3840,AUGUST,
3841,AUGUST,8
3842,AUGUST,
3843,AUGUST,"But soon it left her, entering ’neath the shade"
3844,AUGUST,"Of cedar old and russeted tall pine,"
3845,AUGUST,"Whose mighty tops, seen from the thorny glade,"
3846,AUGUST,Belted the hills about; and now no sign
3847,AUGUST,"Had she to guide her, save the slow descent."
3848,AUGUST,"But swiftly o’er the springy floor she went,"
3849,AUGUST,And drew the odorous air like draughts of wine.
3850,AUGUST,
3851,AUGUST,
3852,AUGUST,9
3853,AUGUST,
3854,AUGUST,Then next she past a forest thick and dark
3855,AUGUST,"With heavy ilexes and platanes high,"
3856,AUGUST,And came to long lush grass; and now coud mark
3857,AUGUST,By many a token that the plain was nigh.
3858,AUGUST,When lo! a river: to whose brink at last
3859,AUGUST,"Being come, upon the bank her limbs she cast,"
3860,AUGUST,And through her sad tears watch’d the stream go by.
3861,AUGUST,
3862,AUGUST,
3863,AUGUST,10
3864,AUGUST,
3865,AUGUST,And now the thought came o’er her that in death
3866,AUGUST,"There was a cure for sorrow, that before"
3867,AUGUST,"Her eyes ran Lethe, she might take one breath"
3868,AUGUST,Of water and be freed for evermore.
3869,AUGUST,"Leaning to look into her tomb, thereon"
3870,AUGUST,"She saw the horror of her image wan,"
3871,AUGUST,And up she rose at height to leap from shore.
3872,AUGUST,
3873,AUGUST,
3874,AUGUST,11
3875,AUGUST,
3876,AUGUST,"When suddenly a mighty voice, that fell"
3877,AUGUST,"With fury on her ears, their sense to scare,"
3878,AUGUST,That bounding from the tree trunks like the yell
3879,AUGUST,"Of hundred brazen trumpets, cried ‘Forbear!"
3880,AUGUST,"Forbear, fond maid, that froward step to take,"
3881,AUGUST,For life can cure the ills that love may make;
3882,AUGUST,But for the harm of death is no repair.’
3883,AUGUST,
3884,AUGUST,
3885,AUGUST,12
3886,AUGUST,
3887,AUGUST,Then looking up she saw an uncouth form
3888,AUGUST,"Perch’d on the further bank, whose parted lips"
3889,AUGUST,Volley’d their friendly warning in a storm:
3890,AUGUST,"A man he might have been, but for the tips"
3891,AUGUST,"Of horns appearing from his shaggy head,"
3892,AUGUST,"For o’er his matted beard his face was red,"
3893,AUGUST,And all his shape was manlike to the hips.
3894,AUGUST,
3895,AUGUST,
3896,AUGUST,13
3897,AUGUST,
3898,AUGUST,"In forehead low, keen eye, and nostril flat"
3899,AUGUST,"He bore the human grace in mean degree,"
3900,AUGUST,"But, set beneath his body squat and fat,"
3901,AUGUST,"Legs like a goat’s, and from the hairy knee"
3902,AUGUST,"The shank fell spare; and, though crosswise he put"
3903,AUGUST,"His limbs in easeful posture, for the foot"
3904,AUGUST,The beast’s divided hoof was plain to see.
3905,AUGUST,
3906,AUGUST,
3907,AUGUST,14
3908,AUGUST,
3909,AUGUST,"Him then she knew the mighty choric God,"
3910,AUGUST,The great hill-haunting and tree-loving Pan;
3911,AUGUST,Whom Zeus had laught to see when first he trod
3912,AUGUST,"Olympus, neither god nor beast nor man:"
3913,AUGUST,Who every rocky peak and snowy crest
3914,AUGUST,"Of the Aspran mountains for his own possest,"
3915,AUGUST,And all their alps with bacchic rout o’erran:
3916,AUGUST,
3917,AUGUST,
3918,AUGUST,15
3919,AUGUST,
3920,AUGUST,"Whom, when his pipe he plays on loud and sweet,"
3921,AUGUST,"And o’er the fitted reeds his moist lip flees,"
3922,AUGUST,Around in measured step with nimble feet
3923,AUGUST,Water-nymphs dance and Hamadryades:
3924,AUGUST,"And all the woodland’s airy folk, who shun"
3925,AUGUST,"Man’s presence, to his frolic pastime run"
3926,AUGUST,From their perennial wells and sacred trees.
3927,AUGUST,
3928,AUGUST,
3929,AUGUST,16
3930,AUGUST,
3931,AUGUST,"Now on his knee his pipe laid by, he spoke"
3932,AUGUST,"With flippant tongue, wounding unwittingly"
3933,AUGUST,The heart he sought to cheer with jest and joke.
3934,AUGUST,"‘And what hast thou to do with misery,’"
3935,AUGUST,"He said, ‘who hast such beauty as might gain"
3936,AUGUST,"The love of Eros? Cast away thy pain,"
3937,AUGUST,And give thy soul to mirth and jollity.
3938,AUGUST,
3939,AUGUST,
3940,AUGUST,17
3941,AUGUST,
3942,AUGUST,"‘Thy mortal life is but a brittle vase,"
3943,AUGUST,But as thee list with wine or tears to fill;
3944,AUGUST,For all the drops therein are Ohs and Ahs
3945,AUGUST,Of joy or grief according to thy will;
3946,AUGUST,"And wouldst thou learn of me my merry way,"
3947,AUGUST,"I’d teach thee change thy lover every day,"
3948,AUGUST,And prize the cup that thou wert fain to spill.
3949,AUGUST,
3950,AUGUST,
3951,AUGUST,18
3952,AUGUST,
3953,AUGUST,"‘Nay, if thou plunge thou shalt not drown nor sink,"
3954,AUGUST,"For I will to thee o’er the stream afloat,"
3955,AUGUST,And bear thee safe; and O I know a drink
3956,AUGUST,"For care, that makes sweet music in the throat."
3957,AUGUST,"Come live with me, my love; I’ll cure thy chance:"
3958,AUGUST,"For I can laugh and quaff, and pipe and dance,"
3959,AUGUST,"Swim like a fish, and caper like a goat.’"
3960,AUGUST,
3961,AUGUST,
3962,AUGUST,19
3963,AUGUST,
3964,AUGUST,"Speaking, his brute divinity explored"
3965,AUGUST,The secret of her silence; and old Pan
3966,AUGUST,Grew kind and told her of a shallow ford
3967,AUGUST,"Where lower down the stream o’er pebbles ran,"
3968,AUGUST,And one might pass at ease with ankles dry:
3969,AUGUST,"Whither she went, and crossing o’er thereby,"
3970,AUGUST,Her lonely wanderings through the isle began.
3971,AUGUST,
3972,AUGUST,
3973,AUGUST,20
3974,AUGUST,
3975,AUGUST,"But none could tell, no, nor herself had told"
3976,AUGUST,"Where food she found, or shelter through the land"
3977,AUGUST,By day or night; until by fate control’d
3978,AUGUST,"She came by steep ways to the southern strand,"
3979,AUGUST,"Where, sacred to the Twins and Britomart,"
3980,AUGUST,"Pent in its rocky theatre apart,"
3981,AUGUST,A little town stood on the level sand.
3982,AUGUST,
3983,AUGUST,
3984,AUGUST,21
3985,AUGUST,
3986,AUGUST,‘Twas where her younger sister’s husband reign’d:
3987,AUGUST,"And Psyche to the palace gate drew near,"
3988,AUGUST,"Helplessly still by Eros’ best constrain’d,"
3989,AUGUST,And knocking begg’d to see her sister dear;
3990,AUGUST,"But when in state stepp’d down that haughty queen,"
3991,AUGUST,"And saw the wan face spent with tears and teen,"
3992,AUGUST,"She smiled, and said ‘Psyche, what dost thou here?’"
3993,AUGUST,
3994,AUGUST,
3995,AUGUST,22
3996,AUGUST,
3997,AUGUST,"Then Psyche told how, having well employ’d"
3998,AUGUST,"Their means, and done their bidding not amiss,"
3999,AUGUST,"Looking on him her hand would have destroy’d,"
4000,AUGUST,"’Twas Eros; whom in love leaning to kiss,"
4001,AUGUST,"Even as she kisst, a drop of burning oil"
4002,AUGUST,"Fall’n from the lamp had served her scheme to foil,"
4003,AUGUST,Discovering her in vision of her bliss;
4004,AUGUST,
4005,AUGUST,
4006,AUGUST,23
4007,AUGUST,
4008,AUGUST,"Wherewith the god stung, like a startled bird"
4009,AUGUST,"Arose in air, and she fell back in swoon;"
4010,AUGUST,"‘But ere he parted,’ said she, ‘he confer’d"
4011,AUGUST,On thee the irrecoverable boon
4012,AUGUST,"By prying lost to me: _Go tell_, he said,"
4013,AUGUST,"_Thy sister that I love her in thy stead,"
4014,AUGUST,And bid her by her love haste hither soon_.’
4015,AUGUST,
4016,AUGUST,
4017,AUGUST,24
4018,AUGUST,
4019,AUGUST,"Which when that heart of malice heard, it took"
4020,AUGUST,The jealous fancy of her silly lust:
4021,AUGUST,And pitilessly with triumphant look
4022,AUGUST,"She drank the flattery, and gave full trust;"
4023,AUGUST,"And leaving Psyche ere she more could tell,"
4024,AUGUST,"Ran off to bid her spouse for aye farewell,"
4025,AUGUST,And in his ear this ready lie she thrust:
4026,AUGUST,
4027,AUGUST,
4028,AUGUST,25
4029,AUGUST,
4030,AUGUST,"‘My dearest sister Psyche, she whose fate"
4031,AUGUST,"We mourn’d, hath reappear’d alive and hale,"
4032,AUGUST,But brings sad news; my father dies: full late
4033,AUGUST,"These tidings come, but love may yet avail;"
4034,AUGUST,"Let me be gone.’ And stealing blind consent,"
4035,AUGUST,"Forth on that well-remember’d road she went,"
4036,AUGUST,And climb’d upon the peak above the dale.
4037,AUGUST,
4038,AUGUST,
4039,AUGUST,26
4040,AUGUST,
4041,AUGUST,"There on the topmost rock, where Psyche first"
4042,AUGUST,"Had by her weeping sire been left to die,"
4043,AUGUST,"She stood a moment, in her hope accurst"
4044,AUGUST,Being happy; and the cliffs took up her cry
4045,AUGUST,"With chuckling mockery from her tongue above,"
4046,AUGUST,"_Zephyr, sweet Zephyr, waft me to my love_!"
4047,AUGUST,When off she lept upon his wings to fly.
4048,AUGUST,
4049,AUGUST,
4050,AUGUST,27
4051,AUGUST,
4052,AUGUST,"But as a dead stone, from a height let fall,"
4053,AUGUST,Silent and straight is gather’d by the force
4054,AUGUST,"Of earth’s vast mass upon its weight so small,"
4055,AUGUST,In speed increasing as it nears its source
4056,AUGUST,Of motion--by which law all things so’er
4057,AUGUST,"Are clutch’d and dragg’d and held--so fell she there,"
4058,AUGUST,"Like a dead stone, down in her headlong course."
4059,AUGUST,
4060,AUGUST,
4061,AUGUST,28
4062,AUGUST,
4063,AUGUST,The disregardful silence heard her strike
4064,AUGUST,Upon the solid crags; her dismal shriek
4065,AUGUST,Rang on the rocks and died out laughter-like
4066,AUGUST,Along the vale in hurried trebles weak;
4067,AUGUST,"And soon upon her, from their skiey haunt"
4068,AUGUST,"Fell to their feast the great birds bald and gaunt,"
4069,AUGUST,And gorged on her fair flesh with bloody beak.
4070,AUGUST,
4071,AUGUST,
4072,AUGUST,29
4073,AUGUST,
4074,AUGUST,"But Psyche, when her sister was gone forth,"
4075,AUGUST,Went out again her wandering way to take:
4076,AUGUST,"And following a stream that led her north,"
4077,AUGUST,"After some days she pass’d the Corian Lake,"
4078,AUGUST,"Whereby Athena’s temple stands, and he"
4079,AUGUST,Who traverses the isle from sea to sea
4080,AUGUST,May by the plain his shortest journey make:
4081,AUGUST,
4082,AUGUST,
4083,AUGUST,30
4084,AUGUST,
4085,AUGUST,Till on the northern coast arrived she came
4086,AUGUST,"Upon a city built about a port,"
4087,AUGUST,"The which she knew, soon as she heard the name,"
4088,AUGUST,Was where her elder sister had her court;
4089,AUGUST,"To whom, as Eros had commanded her,"
4090,AUGUST,She now in turn became the messenger
4091,AUGUST,"Of vengeful punishment, that fell not short:"
4092,AUGUST,
4093,AUGUST,
4094,AUGUST,31
4095,AUGUST,
4096,AUGUST,"For she too hearing gan her heart exalt,"
4097,AUGUST,"Nor pity felt for Psyche’s tears and moans,"
4098,AUGUST,"But, fellow’d with that other in her fault,"
4099,AUGUST,Follow’d her to her fate upon the stones;
4100,AUGUST,And from the peak leaping like her below
4101,AUGUST,"The self-same way unto the self-same woe,"
4102,AUGUST,Lay dasht to death upon her sister’s bones.

4169,SEPTEMBER,"Thereon about this time the snowy gull,"
4170,SEPTEMBER,"Minion of Aphrodite, being come,"
4171,SEPTEMBER,"Plumed himself, standing on the sea-wrack dull,"
4172,SEPTEMBER,That drifted from the foot of Cyamum;
4173,SEPTEMBER,"And ’twas his thought, that had the goddess learnt"
4174,SEPTEMBER,"The tale of Psyche loved and Eros burnt,"
4175,SEPTEMBER,She ne’er so long had kept aloof and dumb.
4176,SEPTEMBER,
4177,SEPTEMBER,
4178,SEPTEMBER,6
4179,SEPTEMBER,
4180,SEPTEMBER,Wherefore that duteous gossip of Love’s queen
4181,SEPTEMBER,Devised that he the messenger would be;
4182,SEPTEMBER,"And rising from the rock, he skim’d between"
4183,SEPTEMBER,The chasing waves--such grace have none but he;—
4184,SEPTEMBER,"Into the middle deep then down he dived,"
4185,SEPTEMBER,And rowing with his glistening wings arrived
4186,SEPTEMBER,At Aphrodite’s bower beneath the sea.
4187,SEPTEMBER,
4188,SEPTEMBER,
4189,SEPTEMBER,7
4190,SEPTEMBER,
4191,SEPTEMBER,The eddies from his silver pinions swirl’d
4192,SEPTEMBER,"The crimson, green, and yellow floss, that grew"
4193,SEPTEMBER,"About the caves, and at his passing curl’d"
4194,SEPTEMBER,"Its graceful silk, and gently waved anew:"
4195,SEPTEMBER,"Till, oaring here and there, the queen he found"
4196,SEPTEMBER,"Stray’d from her haunt unto a sandy ground,"
4197,SEPTEMBER,Dappl’d with eye-rings in the sunlight blue.

4201,SEPTEMBER,
4202,SEPTEMBER,"She, as he came upon her from above,"
4203,SEPTEMBER,"With Hora play’d; Hora, her herald fair,"
4204,SEPTEMBER,That lays the soft necessity of Love
4205,SEPTEMBER,"On maidens’ eyelids, and with tender care"
4206,SEPTEMBER,"Marketh the hour, as in all works is fit:"
4207,SEPTEMBER,"And happy they in love who time outwit,"

4210,SEPTEMBER,
4211,SEPTEMBER,9
4212,SEPTEMBER,
4213,SEPTEMBER,But he with garrulous and laughing tongue
4214,SEPTEMBER,"Broke up his news; how Eros, fallen sick,"
4215,SEPTEMBER,"Lay tossing on his bed, to frenzy stung"
4216,SEPTEMBER,By such a burn as did but barely prick:
4217,SEPTEMBER,"A little bleb, no bigger than a pease,"
4218,SEPTEMBER,"Upon his shoulder ’twas, that kill’d his ease,"
4219,SEPTEMBER,"Fever’d his heart, and made his breathing thick."

4227,SEPTEMBER,Thyself amongst us now a dreary space:
4228,SEPTEMBER,The pining mortals suffer from a dearth

4238,SEPTEMBER,"Forget their faith, and part with words unkind:"
4239,SEPTEMBER,In the first moon thy honey bond is loath’d:

4251,SEPTEMBER,"All joy is dead, and as the year advanceth"
4252,SEPTEMBER,The signs of woe increase on man and brute.

4255,SEPTEMBER,13
4256,SEPTEMBER,
4257,SEPTEMBER,"‘’Tis plain that if thy pleasure longer pause,"
4258,SEPTEMBER,Thy mighty rule on earth hath seen its day:
4259,SEPTEMBER,"The race must come to perish, and no cause"
4260,SEPTEMBER,"But that thou sittest with thy nymphs at play,"
4261,SEPTEMBER,While on a Cretan hill thy truant boy
4262,SEPTEMBER,"Hath with his pretty mistress turn’d to toy,"
4263,SEPTEMBER,And less for pain than love pineth away.’
4264,SEPTEMBER,
4265,SEPTEMBER,
4266,SEPTEMBER,14
4267,SEPTEMBER,
4268,SEPTEMBER,‘Ha! Mistress!’ cried she; ‘Hath my beardless son
4269,SEPTEMBER,Been hunting for himself his lovely game?
4270,SEPTEMBER,Some young Orestiad hath his fancy won?
4271,SEPTEMBER,Some Naiad? say; or is a Grace his flame?

4283,SEPTEMBER,"But Aphrodite’s look daunted his cheer,"
4284,SEPTEMBER,"Ascare he fled away, screaming in fear,"
4285,SEPTEMBER,To see what wrath his simple tale had stirr’d.

4287,SEPTEMBER,
4288,SEPTEMBER,16
4289,SEPTEMBER,
4290,SEPTEMBER,"He flasht his pens, and sweeping widely round"
4291,SEPTEMBER,"Tower’d to air; so swift in all his way,"
4292,SEPTEMBER,That whence he dived he there again was found
4293,SEPTEMBER,As soon as if he had but dipt for prey:
4294,SEPTEMBER,"And now, or e’er he join’d his wailful flock,"
4295,SEPTEMBER,"Once more he stood upon the Sirens’ rock,"
4296,SEPTEMBER,And preen’d his ruffl’d quills for fresh display.
4297,SEPTEMBER,
4298,SEPTEMBER,
4299,SEPTEMBER,17
4300,SEPTEMBER,
4301,SEPTEMBER,But as ill tidings will their truth assure
4302,SEPTEMBER,"Without more witness than their fatal sense,"
4303,SEPTEMBER,"So, since was nothing bitterer to endure,"
4304,SEPTEMBER,The injured goddess guess’d the full offence:
4305,SEPTEMBER,And doubted only whether first to smite
4306,SEPTEMBER,"Or Psyche for her new presumptuous flight,"
4307,SEPTEMBER,Or Eros for his disobedience.
4308,SEPTEMBER,
4309,SEPTEMBER,
4310,SEPTEMBER,18

4314,SEPTEMBER,"And with him sweet Euphrosynè, attent"
4315,SEPTEMBER,"Upon his murmur’d wants, aye as he bade"
4316,SEPTEMBER,Shifted the pillows with each fretful whim;

4320,SEPTEMBER,
4321,SEPTEMBER,19
4322,SEPTEMBER,
4323,SEPTEMBER,"‘O worthy deeds, I say, and true to blood,"
4324,SEPTEMBER,The crown and pledge of promise! thou that wast
4325,SEPTEMBER,"In estimation my perpetual bud,"
4326,SEPTEMBER,Now fruiting thus untimely to my cost;
4327,SEPTEMBER,"Backsliding from commandment, ay, and worse,"
4328,SEPTEMBER,"With bliss to favour one I bade thee curse,"
4329,SEPTEMBER,And save the life I left with thee for lost!

4336,SEPTEMBER,"My rival, that my trusted officer"
4337,SEPTEMBER,Might of mine enemy my daughter make!
4338,SEPTEMBER,"Dost thou then think my love for thee so fond,"
4339,SEPTEMBER,"And miserably doting, that the bond"
4340,SEPTEMBER,By such dishonour strainèd will not break?

4358,SEPTEMBER,And having smirch’d our fame while yet a child
4359,SEPTEMBER,Wilt further foul it now with earthly fire.
4360,SEPTEMBER,But I--do as thou may--have vow’d to kill
4361,SEPTEMBER,"Thy fancied girl, whether thou love her still,"
4362,SEPTEMBER,Or of her silly charms already tire.
4363,SEPTEMBER,
4364,SEPTEMBER,
4365,SEPTEMBER,23
4366,SEPTEMBER,
4367,SEPTEMBER,"‘Tell me but where she hides.’ And Eros now,"
4368,SEPTEMBER,"Proud in his woe, boasted his happy theft:"
4369,SEPTEMBER,"Confessing he had loved her well, and how"
4370,SEPTEMBER,By her own doing she was lost and left;
4371,SEPTEMBER,And homeless in such sorrow as outwent
4372,SEPTEMBER,"The utmost pain of other punishment,"
4373,SEPTEMBER,Was wandering of his love and favour reft.
4374,SEPTEMBER,
4375,SEPTEMBER,
4376,SEPTEMBER,24
4377,SEPTEMBER,
4378,SEPTEMBER,"By which was Cypris gladden’d, not appeased,"
4379,SEPTEMBER,But hid her joy and spake no more her threat:
4380,SEPTEMBER,And left with face like one that much displeased
4381,SEPTEMBER,Hath yet betray’d that he can wrong forget.
4382,SEPTEMBER,When lo! as swiftly she came stepping down
4383,SEPTEMBER,From her fair house into the heavenly town
4384,SEPTEMBER,The Kronian sisters on the way she met;
4385,SEPTEMBER,
4386,SEPTEMBER,
4387,SEPTEMBER,25
4388,SEPTEMBER,
4389,SEPTEMBER,"Hera, the Wife of Zeus, her placid front"
4390,SEPTEMBER,"Dark with the shadow of his troubl’d reign,"
4391,SEPTEMBER,"And tall Demeter, who with men once wont,"
4392,SEPTEMBER,Holding the high Olympians in disdain
4393,SEPTEMBER,"For Persephassa’s rape; which now forgiven,"
4394,SEPTEMBER,"She had return’d unto the courts of Heaven,"
4395,SEPTEMBER,And ’mong the immortals liv’d at peace again:
4396,SEPTEMBER,
4397,SEPTEMBER,
4398,SEPTEMBER,26
4399,SEPTEMBER,
4400,SEPTEMBER,Whose smile told Aphrodite that they knew
4401,SEPTEMBER,The meaning of her visit; and a flush
4402,SEPTEMBER,"Of anger answer’d them, while hot she grew."
4403,SEPTEMBER,But Hera laugh’d outright: ‘Why thou dost blush!
4404,SEPTEMBER,Now see we modest manners on my life!
4405,SEPTEMBER,And all thy little son has got a wife
4406,SEPTEMBER,Can make the crimson to thy forehead rush.
4407,SEPTEMBER,
4408,SEPTEMBER,
4409,SEPTEMBER,27
4410,SEPTEMBER,
4411,SEPTEMBER,"‘Didst think he, whom thou madest passion’s prince,"
4412,SEPTEMBER,No privy dart then for himself would poise?
4413,SEPTEMBER,"Nay, by the cuckoo on my sceptre, since"
4414,SEPTEMBER,"’Twas love that made thee mother of his joys,"
4415,SEPTEMBER,Art thou the foremost to his favour bound;
4416,SEPTEMBER,As thou shouldst be the last to think to sound
4417,SEPTEMBER,"The heart, and least of all thy wanton boy’s.’"
4418,SEPTEMBER,
4419,SEPTEMBER,
4420,SEPTEMBER,28
4421,SEPTEMBER,
4422,SEPTEMBER,"But her Demeter, on whose stalwart arm"
4423,SEPTEMBER,"She lean’d, took up: ‘If thou wilt hark to me,"
4424,SEPTEMBER,"This Psyche,’ said she, ‘hath the heavenly charm,"
4425,SEPTEMBER,And will become immortal. And maybe
4426,SEPTEMBER,To marry with a woman is as well
4427,SEPTEMBER,As wed a god and live below in Hell:
4428,SEPTEMBER,As ’twas my lot in child of mine to see.’
4429,SEPTEMBER,
4430,SEPTEMBER,
4431,SEPTEMBER,29
4432,SEPTEMBER,
4433,SEPTEMBER,"Which things they both said, fearing in their hearts"
4434,SEPTEMBER,"That savage Eros, if they mockt his case,"
4435,SEPTEMBER,"Would kill their peace with his revengeful darts,"
4436,SEPTEMBER,And bring them haply to a worse disgrace:
4437,SEPTEMBER,"But Aphrodite, saying ‘Good! my dames;"
4438,SEPTEMBER,"Behind this smoke I see the spite that flames,’"
4439,SEPTEMBER,"Left them, and on her journey went apace."
4440,SEPTEMBER,
4441,SEPTEMBER,
4442,SEPTEMBER,30
4443,SEPTEMBER,
4444,SEPTEMBER,For having purposed she would hold no truce
4445,SEPTEMBER,"With Psyche or her son, ’twas in her mind"
4446,SEPTEMBER,"To go forthwith unto the throne of Zeus,"
4447,SEPTEMBER,And beg that Hermes might be sent to find
4448,SEPTEMBER,The wanderer; and secure that in such quest
4449,SEPTEMBER,"He would not fail, she ponder’d but how best"
4450,SEPTEMBER,She might inflict her vengeance long-design’d:

4452,SEPTEMBER,

4454,SEPTEMBER,
4455,OCTOBER,OCTOBER
4456,OCTOBER,
4457,OCTOBER,
4458,OCTOBER,1
4459,OCTOBER,
4460,OCTOBER,"Heavy meanwhile at heart, with bruisèd feet"
4461,OCTOBER,Was Psyche wandering many nights and days
4462,OCTOBER,"Upon the paths of hundred-citied Crete,"
4463,OCTOBER,And chose to step the most deserted ways;
4464,OCTOBER,Being least unhappy when she went unseen;
4465,OCTOBER,Since else her secret sorrow had no screen
4466,OCTOBER,From the plain question of men’s idle gaze.
4467,OCTOBER,
4468,OCTOBER,
4469,OCTOBER,2
4470,OCTOBER,
4471,OCTOBER,Yet wheresoe’er she went one hope she had;
4472,OCTOBER,"Like mortal mourners, who ’gainst reason strong"
4473,OCTOBER,Hope to be unexpectedly made glad
4474,OCTOBER,"With sight of their dead friends, so much they long;"
4475,OCTOBER,"So she for him, whom loss a thousandfold"
4476,OCTOBER,Endear’d and made desired; nor could she hold
4477,OCTOBER,He would not turn and quite forgive her wrong.
4478,OCTOBER,
4479,OCTOBER,
4480,OCTOBER,3
4481,OCTOBER,
4482,OCTOBER,Wherefore her eager eyes in every place
4483,OCTOBER,Lookt for her lover; and ’twixt hope and fear
4484,OCTOBER,"She follow’d oft afar some form of grace,"
4485,OCTOBER,In pain alike to lose or venture near.
4486,OCTOBER,"And still this thought cheer’d her fatigue, that he,"
4487,OCTOBER,"Or on some hill, or by some brook or tree,"
4488,OCTOBER,But waited for her coming to appear.
4489,OCTOBER,
4490,OCTOBER,
4491,OCTOBER,4
4492,OCTOBER,
4493,OCTOBER,And then for comfort many an old love-crost
4494,OCTOBER,"And doleful ditty would she gently sing,"
4495,OCTOBER,"Writ by sad poets of a lover lost,"
4496,OCTOBER,Now sounding sweeter for her sorrowing:
4497,OCTOBER,"_Echo, sweet Echo, watching up on high,"
4498,OCTOBER,"Say hast thou seen to-day my love go by,"
4499,OCTOBER,Or where thou sittest by thy mossy spring?_
4500,OCTOBER,
4501,OCTOBER,
4502,OCTOBER,5
4503,OCTOBER,
4504,OCTOBER,"_Or say ye nymphs, that from the crystal rills,"
4505,OCTOBER,"When ye have bathed your limbs from morn till eve,"
4506,OCTOBER,"Flying at midnight to the bare-topt hills,"
4507,OCTOBER,"Beneath the stars your mazy dances weave,"
4508,OCTOBER,"Say, my deserter whom ye well may know"
4509,OCTOBER,"By his small wings, his quiver, and his bow,"
4510,OCTOBER,"Say, have ye seen my love, whose loss I grieve?_"
4511,OCTOBER,
4512,OCTOBER,
4513,OCTOBER,6
4514,OCTOBER,
4515,OCTOBER,Till climb’d one evening on a rocky steep
4516,OCTOBER,"Above the plain of Cisamos, that lay,"
4517,OCTOBER,"Robb’d of its golden harvest, in the deep"
4518,OCTOBER,"Mountainous shadows of the dying day,"
4519,OCTOBER,"She saw a temple, whose tall columns fair"
4520,OCTOBER,"Recall’d her home; and ‘O if thou be there,"
4521,OCTOBER,"My love,’ she cried, ‘fly not again away.’"
4522,OCTOBER,
4523,OCTOBER,
4524,OCTOBER,7
4525,OCTOBER,
4526,OCTOBER,"Swiftly she ran, and entering by the door"
4527,OCTOBER,She stood alone within an empty fane
4528,OCTOBER,"Of great Demeter: and, behold, the floor"
4529,OCTOBER,"Was litter’d with thank-offerings of grain,"
4530,OCTOBER,With wheat and barley-sheaves together heapt
4531,OCTOBER,In holy harvest-home of them that reapt
4532,OCTOBER,The goddess’ plenteous gifts upon the plain;
4533,OCTOBER,
4534,OCTOBER,
4535,OCTOBER,8
4536,OCTOBER,
4537,OCTOBER,And on the tithe the tackle of the tithe
4538,OCTOBER,"Thrown by in such confusion, as are laid"
4539,OCTOBER,"Upon the swath sickle, and hook, and scythe,"
4540,OCTOBER,When midday drives the reapers to the shade.
4541,OCTOBER,"And Psyche, since had come no priestess there"
4542,OCTOBER,"To trim the temple, in her pious care"
4543,OCTOBER,"Forgat herself, and lent her duteous aid."
4544,OCTOBER,
4545,OCTOBER,
4546,OCTOBER,9
4547,OCTOBER,
4548,OCTOBER,"She drew the offerings from the midst aside,"
4549,OCTOBER,And piled the sheaves at every pillar’s base;
4550,OCTOBER,"And sweeping therebetween a passage wide,"
4551,OCTOBER,Made clear of corn and chaff the temple space:
4552,OCTOBER,"As countrymen who bring their wheat to mart,"
4553,OCTOBER,Set out their show along the walls apart
4554,OCTOBER,"By their allotted stations, each in place;"
4555,OCTOBER,
4556,OCTOBER,
4557,OCTOBER,10
4558,OCTOBER,
4559,OCTOBER,"Thus she, and felt no weariness,--such strength"
4560,OCTOBER,"Hath duty to support our feeble frame,—"
4561,OCTOBER,"Till all was set in order, and at length"
4562,OCTOBER,Up to the threshold of the shrine she came:
4563,OCTOBER,"When lo! before her face with friendly smile,"
4564,OCTOBER,"Tall as a pillar of the peristyle,"
4565,OCTOBER,"The goddess stood reveal’d, and call’d her name."
4566,OCTOBER,
4567,OCTOBER,
4568,OCTOBER,11
4569,OCTOBER,
4570,OCTOBER,"‘Unhappy Psyche,’ said she, ‘know’st thou not"
4571,OCTOBER,How Aphrodite to thy hurt is sworn?
4572,OCTOBER,"And thou, thy peril and her wrath forgot,"
4573,OCTOBER,Spendest thy thought my temple to adorn.
4574,OCTOBER,"Take better heed!’--And Psyche, at the voice"
4575,OCTOBER,"Even of so little comfort, gan rejoice,"
4576,OCTOBER,And at her feet pour’d out this prayer forlorn.
4577,OCTOBER,
4578,OCTOBER,
4579,OCTOBER,12
4580,OCTOBER,
4581,OCTOBER,"‘O Gracious giver of the golden grain,"
4582,OCTOBER,"Hide me, I pray thee, from her wrath unkind;"
4583,OCTOBER,"For who can pity as canst thou my pain,"
4584,OCTOBER,"Who wert thyself a wanderer, vex’d in mind"
4585,OCTOBER,"For loss of thy dear Corè once, whenas,"
4586,OCTOBER,"Ravisht to hell by fierce Agesilas,"
4587,OCTOBER,Thou soughtest her on earth and coudst not find.

4590,OCTOBER,13
4591,OCTOBER,
4592,OCTOBER,"‘How coud thy feet bear thee to western night,"
4593,OCTOBER,"And where swart Libyans watch the sacred tree,"
4594,OCTOBER,"And thrice to ford o’er Achelous bright,"
4595,OCTOBER,And all the streams of beauteous Sicily?
4596,OCTOBER,"And thrice to Enna cam’st thou, thrice, they tell,"
4597,OCTOBER,"Satest athirst by Callichorus’ well,"
4598,OCTOBER,Nor tookest of the spring to comfort thee.
4599,OCTOBER,
4600,OCTOBER,
4601,OCTOBER,14
4602,OCTOBER,
4603,OCTOBER,"‘By that remember’d anguish of thine heart,"
4604,OCTOBER,"Lady, have pity even on me, and show"
4605,OCTOBER,Where I may find my love; and take my part
4606,OCTOBER,"For peace, I pray, against my cruel foe:"
4607,OCTOBER,"Or if thou canst not from her anger shield,"
4608,OCTOBER,Here let me lie among the sheaves conceal’d
4609,OCTOBER,Such time till forth I may in safety go.’
4610,OCTOBER,
4611,OCTOBER,
4612,OCTOBER,15
4613,OCTOBER,
4614,OCTOBER,"Demeter answer’d, ‘Nay, though thou constrain"
4615,OCTOBER,"My favour with thy plea, my help must still"
4616,OCTOBER,"Be hidden, else I work for thee in vain"
4617,OCTOBER,To thwart my mighty sister in her will.
4618,OCTOBER,"Thou must fly hence: Yet though I not oppose,"
4619,OCTOBER,Less will I aid her; and if now I close
4620,OCTOBER,"My temple doors to thee, take it not ill.’"
4621,OCTOBER,
4622,OCTOBER,
4623,OCTOBER,16
4624,OCTOBER,
4625,OCTOBER,"Then Psyche’s hope founder’d; as when a ship,"
4626,OCTOBER,The morrow of the gale can hardly ride
4627,OCTOBER,"The swollen seas, fetching a deeper dip"
4628,OCTOBER,"At every wave, and through her gaping side"
4629,OCTOBER,"And o’er her shattered bulwark ever drinks,"
4630,OCTOBER,"Till plunging in the watery wild she sinks,"
4631,OCTOBER,To scoop her grave beneath the crushing tide:
4632,OCTOBER,
4633,OCTOBER,
4634,OCTOBER,17
4635,OCTOBER,
4636,OCTOBER,So with each word her broken spirit drank
4637,OCTOBER,Its doom; and overwhelm’d with deep despair
4638,OCTOBER,"She turn’d away, and coming forth she sank"
4639,OCTOBER,"Silently weeping on the temple stair,"
4640,OCTOBER,"In midmost night, forspent with long turmoil:"
4641,OCTOBER,"But sleep, the gracious pursuivant of toil,"
4642,OCTOBER,"Came swiftly down, and nursed away her care."
4643,OCTOBER,
4644,OCTOBER,
4645,OCTOBER,18
4646,OCTOBER,
4647,OCTOBER,And when the sun awaked her with his beams
4648,OCTOBER,"She found new hope, that still her sorrow’s cure"
4649,OCTOBER,"Lay with the gods, who in her morning dreams"
4650,OCTOBER,Had sent her comfort in a vision sure;
4651,OCTOBER,"Wherein the Cretan-born, almightiest god,"
4652,OCTOBER,"Cloud-gathering Zeus himself had seem’d to nod,"
4653,OCTOBER,And bid her with good heart her woes endure.
4654,OCTOBER,
4655,OCTOBER,
4656,OCTOBER,19
4657,OCTOBER,
4658,OCTOBER,So coming that same day unto a shrine
4659,OCTOBER,"Of Hera, she took courage and went in:"
4660,OCTOBER,And like to one that to the cell divine
4661,OCTOBER,"For favour ventures or a suit to win,"
4662,OCTOBER,"She drew anigh the altar, from her face"
4663,OCTOBER,"Wiping the tears, ere to the heavenly grace,"
4664,OCTOBER,"As thus she pray’d, she would her prayer begin."
4665,OCTOBER,
4666,OCTOBER,
4667,OCTOBER,20
4668,OCTOBER,
4669,OCTOBER,"‘Most honour’d Lady, who from ancient doom"
4670,OCTOBER,"Wert made heaven’s wife, and art on earth besought"
4671,OCTOBER,With gracious happiness of all to whom
4672,OCTOBER,"Thy holy wedlock hath my burden brought,"
4673,OCTOBER,"Save me from Aphrodite’s fell pursuit,"
4674,OCTOBER,"And guard unto the birth Love’s hapless fruit,"
4675,OCTOBER,Which she for cruel spite would bring to nought.
4676,OCTOBER,
4677,OCTOBER,
4678,OCTOBER,21
4679,OCTOBER,
4680,OCTOBER,‘As once from her thou wert not shamed to take
4681,OCTOBER,"Her beauty’s zone, thy beauty to enhance;"
4682,OCTOBER,"For which again Zeus loved thee, to forsake"
4683,OCTOBER,His warlike ire in faithful dalliance;
4684,OCTOBER,"Show me what means may win my Love to me,"
4685,OCTOBER,"Or how that I may come, if so may be,"
4686,OCTOBER,Within the favour of his countenance.
4687,OCTOBER,
4688,OCTOBER,
4689,OCTOBER,22
4690,OCTOBER,
4691,OCTOBER,"‘If there be any place for tears or prayer,"
4692,OCTOBER,"If there be need for succour in distress,"
4693,OCTOBER,"Now is the very hour of all despair,"
4694,OCTOBER,Here is the heart of grief and bitterness.
4695,OCTOBER,"Motherly pity, bend thy face and grant"
4696,OCTOBER,"One beam of ruth to thy poor suppliant,"
4697,OCTOBER,Nor turn me from thine altar comfortless.’
4698,OCTOBER,
4699,OCTOBER,
4700,OCTOBER,23
4701,OCTOBER,
4702,OCTOBER,"Even as she pray’d a cloud spread through the cell,"
4703,OCTOBER,And ’mid the wreathings of the vapour dim
4704,OCTOBER,"The goddess grew in glory visible,"
4705,OCTOBER,Like some barbaric queen in festal trim;
4706,OCTOBER,"Such the attire and ornaments she wore,"
4707,OCTOBER,When o’er the forgèd threshold of the floor
4708,OCTOBER,Of Zeus’s house she stept to visit him.
4709,OCTOBER,
4710,OCTOBER,
4711,OCTOBER,24
4712,OCTOBER,
4713,OCTOBER,"From either ear, ring’d to its piercèd lobe"
4714,OCTOBER,"A triple jewel hung, with gold enchas’t;"
4715,OCTOBER,And o’er her breasts her wide ambrosial robe
4716,OCTOBER,With many a shining golden clasp was brac’t;
4717,OCTOBER,The flowering on its smooth embroider’d lawn
4718,OCTOBER,Gather’d to colour where the zone was drawn
4719,OCTOBER,In fringe of golden tassels at her waist.
4720,OCTOBER,
4721,OCTOBER,
4722,OCTOBER,15
4723,OCTOBER,
4724,OCTOBER,"Her curling hair with plaited braid and brail,"
4725,OCTOBER,"Pendant or loop’d about her head divine,"
4726,OCTOBER,"Lay hidden half beneath a golden veil,"
4727,OCTOBER,Bright as the rippling ocean in sunshine:
4728,OCTOBER,"And on the ground, flashing whene’er she stept,"
4729,OCTOBER,Beneath her feet the dazzling lightnings lept
4730,OCTOBER,From the gold network of her sandals fine.
4731,OCTOBER,
4732,OCTOBER,
4733,OCTOBER,26
4734,OCTOBER,
4735,OCTOBER,Thus Hera stood in royal guise bedeckt
4736,OCTOBER,"Before poor Psyche on the stair that knelt,"
4737,OCTOBER,"Whose new-nursed hope at that display was checkt,"
4738,OCTOBER,And all her happier thoughts gan fade and melt.
4739,OCTOBER,"She saw no kindness in such haughty mien,"
4740,OCTOBER,"And venturing not to look upon the queen,"
4741,OCTOBER,Bow’d down in woe to hear her sentence dealt.
4742,OCTOBER,
4743,OCTOBER,
4744,OCTOBER,27
4745,OCTOBER,
4746,OCTOBER,"And thus the goddess spake, ‘In vain thou suest,"
4747,OCTOBER,Most miserable Psyche; though my heart
4748,OCTOBER,"Be full of hate for her whose hate thou ruest,"
4749,OCTOBER,And pride and pity move me to thy part:
4750,OCTOBER,"Yet not till Zeus make known his will, coud I,"
4751,OCTOBER,"Least of the blameless gods that dwell on high,"
4752,OCTOBER,"Assist thee, wert thou worthier than thou art."
4753,OCTOBER,
4754,OCTOBER,
4755,OCTOBER,28
4756,OCTOBER,
4757,OCTOBER,"‘But know if Eros love thee, that thy hopes"
4758,OCTOBER,Should rest on him; and I would bid thee go
4759,OCTOBER,Where in his mother’s house apart he mopes
4760,OCTOBER,Grieving for loss of thee in secret woe:
4761,OCTOBER,"For should he take thee back, there is no power"
4762,OCTOBER,"In earth or heaven will hurt thee from that hour,"
4763,OCTOBER,"Nay, not if Zeus himself should prove thy foe.’"
4764,OCTOBER,
4765,OCTOBER,
4766,OCTOBER,29
4767,OCTOBER,
4768,OCTOBER,"Thus saying she was gone, and Psyche now"
4769,OCTOBER,"Surprised by comfort rose and went her way,"
4770,OCTOBER,"Resolved in heart, and only wondering how"
4771,OCTOBER,’Twas possible to come where Eros lay;
4772,OCTOBER,"Since that her feet, however she might roam."
4773,OCTOBER,Could never travel to the heavenly home
4774,OCTOBER,"Of Love, beyond the bounds of mortal day:"
4775,OCTOBER,
4776,OCTOBER,
4777,OCTOBER,30
4778,OCTOBER,
4779,OCTOBER,Yet must she come to him. And now ’twas proved
4780,OCTOBER,"How that to Lovers, as is told in song,"
4781,OCTOBER,Seeking the way no place is far removed;
4782,OCTOBER,"Nor is there any obstacle so strong,"
4783,OCTOBER,Nor bar so fix’d that it can hinder them:
4784,OCTOBER,And how to reach heaven’s gate by stratagem
4785,OCTOBER,Vex’d not the venturous heart of Psyche long.
4786,OCTOBER,
4787,OCTOBER,
4788,OCTOBER,31
4789,OCTOBER,
4790,OCTOBER,To face her enemy might well avail:
4791,OCTOBER,"Wherefore to Cypris’ shrine her steps she bent,"
4792,OCTOBER,Hoping the goddess in her hate might hale
4793,OCTOBER,"Her body to the skies for punishment,"
4794,OCTOBER,Whate’er to be; yet now her fiercest wrath
4795,OCTOBER,"Seem’d happiest fortune, seeing ’twas the path"
4796,OCTOBER,Whereby alone unto her love she went.

4807,NOVEMBER,"Being bound, bade beckon out her milkwhite steeds,"
4808,NOVEMBER,"Four doves, that ready to her royal use"
4809,NOVEMBER,In golden cages stood and peck’d the seeds:
4810,NOVEMBER,Best of the nimble air’s high-sailing folk
4811,NOVEMBER,"That wore with pride the marking of her yoke,"

4816,NOVEMBER,
4817,NOVEMBER,"These drew in turn her chariot, when in state"

4820,NOVEMBER,"Of Zeus’s palace high their flight had dared,"
4821,NOVEMBER,Which darkest vapour and thick glooms enshroud

4830,NOVEMBER,"Bruised in his hideous fall from heaven afar,"
4831,NOVEMBER,"Was nursed by Thetis, and Eurynomè,"
4832,NOVEMBER,The daughter of the ever-refluent main;
4833,NOVEMBER,"With whom he dwelt till he grew sound again,"
4834,NOVEMBER,Down in a hollow cave beside the sea:
4835,NOVEMBER,
4836,NOVEMBER,
4837,NOVEMBER,4
4838,NOVEMBER,
4839,NOVEMBER,"And them for kindness done was prompt to serve,"
4840,NOVEMBER,"Forging them brooches rich in make and mode,"
4841,NOVEMBER,"Earrings, and supple chains of jointed curve,"
4842,NOVEMBER,"And other trinkets, while he there abode:"
4843,NOVEMBER,"And none of gods or men knew of his home,"
4844,NOVEMBER,But they two only; and the salt sea-foam
4845,NOVEMBER,To and fro past his cavern ever flow’d.
4846,NOVEMBER,
4847,NOVEMBER,
4848,NOVEMBER,5
4849,NOVEMBER,
4850,NOVEMBER,"’Twas then he wrought this work within the cave,"
4851,NOVEMBER,"Emboss’d with rich design, a moonèd car;"
4852,NOVEMBER,"And when return’d to heaven to Venus gave,"
4853,NOVEMBER,In form imagined like her crescent star;
4854,NOVEMBER,"Which circling nearest earth, maketh at night"
4855,NOVEMBER,To wakeful mortal men shadow and light
4856,NOVEMBER,Alone of all the stars in heaven that are.

4860,NOVEMBER,
4861,NOVEMBER,"Two slender wheels it had, with fretted tires"

4863,NOVEMBER,Of cloud or ether; and their whirling fires
4864,NOVEMBER,Threw off the air in halo where they roll’d:
4865,NOVEMBER,And either nave that round the axle turn’d
4866,NOVEMBER,"A ruby was, whose steady crimson burn’d"
4867,NOVEMBER,Betwixt the twin speed-mingling fans of gold.
4868,NOVEMBER,
4869,NOVEMBER,
4870,NOVEMBER,7
4871,NOVEMBER,
4872,NOVEMBER,"Thereon the naked goddess mounting, shook"
4873,NOVEMBER,The reins; whereat the doves their wings outspread.
4874,NOVEMBER,And rising high their flight to heaven they took:
4875,NOVEMBER,"And all the birds, that in those courts were bred,"
4876,NOVEMBER,"Of her broad eaves the nested families,"
4877,NOVEMBER,"Sparrows and swallows, join’d their companies"
4878,NOVEMBER,Awhile and twitter’d to her overhead.
4879,NOVEMBER,
4880,NOVEMBER,
4881,NOVEMBER,8
4882,NOVEMBER,
4883,NOVEMBER,But onward she with fading tracks of flame
4884,NOVEMBER,"Sped swiftly, till she reacht her journey’s end:"
4885,NOVEMBER,"And when within the house of Zeus she came,"
4886,NOVEMBER,She pray’d the Sire of Heaven that he would lend
4887,NOVEMBER,"Hermes, the Argus-slayer, for her hest;"
4888,NOVEMBER,"And he being granted her at her request,"
4889,NOVEMBER,She went forthwith to seek him and to send.
4890,NOVEMBER,
4891,NOVEMBER,
4892,NOVEMBER,9
4893,NOVEMBER,
4894,NOVEMBER,Who happ’d within the palace then to wait
4895,NOVEMBER,Upon the almighty pleasure; and her tale
4896,NOVEMBER,"Was quickly told, and he made answer straight"
4897,NOVEMBER,That he would find the truant without fail;
4898,NOVEMBER,Asking the goddess by what signs her slave
4899,NOVEMBER,"Might best be known, and what the price she gave"
4900,NOVEMBER,"For capture, or admitted for the bail."
4901,NOVEMBER,
4902,NOVEMBER,
4903,NOVEMBER,10
4904,NOVEMBER,
4905,NOVEMBER,All which he took his silver stile to write
4906,NOVEMBER,In letters large upon a waxèd board;
4907,NOVEMBER,"Her age and name, her colour, face and height,"
4908,NOVEMBER,"Her home, and parentage, and the reward:"
4909,NOVEMBER,And then read o’er as ’twas to be proclaim’d.
4910,NOVEMBER,"And she took oath to give the price she named,"
4911,NOVEMBER,"Without demur, when Psyche was restored."
4912,NOVEMBER,
4913,NOVEMBER,
4914,NOVEMBER,11
4915,NOVEMBER,
4916,NOVEMBER,Then on his head he closely set his cap
4917,NOVEMBER,"With earèd wings erect, and o’er his knee"
4918,NOVEMBER,He cross’d each foot in turn to prove the strap
4919,NOVEMBER,"That bound his wingèd sandals, and shook free"
4920,NOVEMBER,"His chlamys, and gat up, and in his hand"
4921,NOVEMBER,"Taking his fair white-ribbon’d herald’s wand,"
4922,NOVEMBER,"Lept forth on air, accoutred cap-a-pè."
4923,NOVEMBER,
4924,NOVEMBER,
4925,NOVEMBER,12
4926,NOVEMBER,
4927,NOVEMBER,"And piloting along the mid-day sky,"
4928,NOVEMBER,"Held southward, till the narrow map of Crete"
4929,NOVEMBER,Lay like a fleck in azure ’neath his eye;
4930,NOVEMBER,"When down he came, and as an eagle fleet"
4931,NOVEMBER,"Drops in some combe, then checks his headlong stoop"
4932,NOVEMBER,"With wide-flung wing, wheeling in level swoop"
4933,NOVEMBER,"To strike the bleating quarry with his feet,"
4934,NOVEMBER,
4935,NOVEMBER,
4936,NOVEMBER,13
4937,NOVEMBER,
4938,NOVEMBER,Thus he alighted; and in every town
4939,NOVEMBER,In all the isle before the close of day
4940,NOVEMBER,"Had cried the message, which he carried down,"
4941,NOVEMBER,"Of Psyche, Aphrodite’s runaway;"

5155,DECEMBER,Such as might tempt the weary eye to sleep
5156,DECEMBER,Rather than prick the nerve of taskèd sight.
5157,DECEMBER,"Yet Psyche, not to fail for lack of zeal,"

5166,DECEMBER,Moving with speed: and seeing nought that cast
5167,DECEMBER,"The shade, she bent her down the flame to trim;"
5168,DECEMBER,"And there the beast itself, a little ant,"
5169,DECEMBER,"Climb’d up in compass of the lustre scant,"

5171,DECEMBER,
5172,DECEMBER,
5173,DECEMBER,3
5174,DECEMBER,
5175,DECEMBER,Smiling to see the creature of her fear
5176,DECEMBER,"So dwarf’d by truth, she watcht him where he crept,"
5177,DECEMBER,For mere distraction telling in his ear
5178,DECEMBER,"What straits she then was in, and telling wept."
5179,DECEMBER,Whereat he stood and trim’d his horns; but ere
5180,DECEMBER,"Her tale was done resumed his manner scare,"

5182,DECEMBER,
5183,DECEMBER,
5184,DECEMBER,4
5185,DECEMBER,
5186,DECEMBER,But she intent drew forth with dextrous hand
5187,DECEMBER,"The larger seeds, or push’d the smaller back,"
5188,DECEMBER,Or light from heavy with her breathing fan’d.
5189,DECEMBER,"When suddenly she saw the floor grow black,"
5190,DECEMBER,"And troops of ants, flowing in noiseless train,"
5191,DECEMBER,"Moved to the hill of seeds, as o’er a plain"
5192,DECEMBER,Armies approach a city for attack;
5193,DECEMBER,
5194,DECEMBER,
5195,DECEMBER,5
5196,DECEMBER,
5197,DECEMBER,"And gathering on the grain, began to strive"
5198,DECEMBER,With grappling horns: and each from out the heap
5199,DECEMBER,"His burden drew, and all their motion live"
5200,DECEMBER,Struggled and slid upon the surface steep.
5201,DECEMBER,"And Psyche wonder’d, watching them, to find"
5202,DECEMBER,The creatures separated kind from kind:
5203,DECEMBER,Till dizzied with the sight she fell asleep.
5204,DECEMBER,
5205,DECEMBER,
5206,DECEMBER,6
5207,DECEMBER,
5208,DECEMBER,And when she woke ’twas with the morning sound
5209,DECEMBER,"Of Aphrodite’s anger at the door,"
5210,DECEMBER,"Whom high amaze stay’d backward, as she found"
5211,DECEMBER,Her foe asleep with all her trouble o’er:
5212,DECEMBER,"And round the room beheld, in order due,"
5213,DECEMBER,"The piles arranged distinct and sorted true,"
5214,DECEMBER,"Grain with grain, seed with seed, and spore with spore."
5215,DECEMBER,
5216,DECEMBER,
5217,DECEMBER,7
5218,DECEMBER,
5219,DECEMBER,She fiercely cried ‘Thou shalt not thus escape;
5220,DECEMBER,For to this marvel dar’st thou not pretend.
5221,DECEMBER,"There is but one that coud this order shape,"
5222,DECEMBER,"Demeter,--but I knew her not thy friend."
5223,DECEMBER,"Therefore another trial will I set,"
5224,DECEMBER,"In which she cannot aid thee nor abet,"
5225,DECEMBER,But thou thyself must bring it fair to end.’
5226,DECEMBER,
5227,DECEMBER,
5228,DECEMBER,8
5229,DECEMBER,
5230,DECEMBER,"Thereon she sped her to the bounds of Thrace,"
5231,DECEMBER,"And set her by a river deep and wide,"
5232,DECEMBER,"And said ‘To east beyond this stream, a race"
5233,DECEMBER,Of golden-fleecèd sheep at pasture bide.
5234,DECEMBER,"Go seek them out; and this thy task, to pull"
5235,DECEMBER,"But one lock for me of their precious wool,"
5236,DECEMBER,And give it in my hands at eventide:
5237,DECEMBER,
5238,DECEMBER,
5239,DECEMBER,9
5240,DECEMBER,
5241,DECEMBER,‘This do and thou shalt have thy heart’s desire.’
5242,DECEMBER,"Which said, she fled and left her by the stream:"
5243,DECEMBER,"And Psyche then, with courage still entire"
5244,DECEMBER,Had plunged therein; but now of great esteem
5245,DECEMBER,"Her life she rated, while it lent a spell"
5246,DECEMBER,"Wherein she yet might hope to quit her well,"
5247,DECEMBER,And in one winning all her woes redeem.
5248,DECEMBER,
5249,DECEMBER,
5250,DECEMBER,10
5251,DECEMBER,
5252,DECEMBER,"There as she stood in doubt, a fluting voice"
5253,DECEMBER,"Rose from the flood, ‘Psyche, be not afraid"
5254,DECEMBER,"To hear a reed give tongue, for ’twas of choice"
5255,DECEMBER,That I from mortal flesh a plant was made.
5256,DECEMBER,My name is Syrinx; once from mighty Pan
5257,DECEMBER,"Into the drowning river as I ran,"
5258,DECEMBER,A fearful prayer my steps for ever stay’d.

5266,DECEMBER,Nor if I speak in sorrow is’t my own:
5267,DECEMBER,Rather for thee my voice I now uplift
5268,DECEMBER,"To warn thee plunge not in the river swift,"
5269,DECEMBER,Nor seek the golden sheep to men unknown.
5270,DECEMBER,
5271,DECEMBER,
5272,DECEMBER,12
5273,DECEMBER,
5274,DECEMBER,"‘If thou should cross the stream, which may not be"
5275,DECEMBER,"Thou coudst not climb upon the hanging rocks,"
5276,DECEMBER,"Nor ever, as the goddess bade thee, see"
5277,DECEMBER,The pasture of the yellow-fleecèd flocks:
5278,DECEMBER,"Or if thou coud, their herded horns would gore"
5279,DECEMBER,"And slay thee on the crags, or thrust thee o’er"
5280,DECEMBER,Ere thou coudst rob them of their golden locks.
5281,DECEMBER,
5282,DECEMBER,
5283,DECEMBER,13
5284,DECEMBER,
5285,DECEMBER,‘The goddess means thy death. But I can show
5286,DECEMBER,How thy obedience yet may thwart her will.
5287,DECEMBER,"At noon the golden flocks descend below,"
5288,DECEMBER,"Leaving the scented herbage of the hill,"
5289,DECEMBER,"And where the shelving banks to shallows fall,"
5290,DECEMBER,"Drink at the rippling water one and all,"
5291,DECEMBER,Nor back return till they have drawn their fill.
5292,DECEMBER,
5293,DECEMBER,
5294,DECEMBER,14
5295,DECEMBER,
5296,DECEMBER,"‘I will command a thornbush, that it stoop"
5297,DECEMBER,"Over some ram that steppeth by in peace,"
5298,DECEMBER,"And him in all its prickles firmly coop,"
5299,DECEMBER,Making thee seizure of his golden fleece;
5300,DECEMBER,So without peril of his angry horns
5301,DECEMBER,Shalt thou be quit: for he upon the thorns
5302,DECEMBER,Must leave his ransom ere he win release.’
5303,DECEMBER,
5304,DECEMBER,
5305,DECEMBER,15
5306,DECEMBER,
5307,DECEMBER,"Then Psyche thankt her for her kind befriending,"
5308,DECEMBER,And hid among the rushes looking east;
5309,DECEMBER,And when noon came she saw the flock descending
5310,DECEMBER,Out of the hills; and lo! one golden beast
5311,DECEMBER,Caught in a thornbush; and the mighty brute
5312,DECEMBER,Struggl’d and tore it from its twisted root
5313,DECEMBER,"Into the stream, or e’er he was releas’t."
5314,DECEMBER,
5315,DECEMBER,
5316,DECEMBER,16
5317,DECEMBER,
5318,DECEMBER,"And when they water’d were and gone, the breeze"
5319,DECEMBER,Floated the freighted thorn where Psyche lay:
5320,DECEMBER,"Whence she unhook’d the golden wool at ease,"
5321,DECEMBER,And back to heaven for passage swift gan pray.
5322,DECEMBER,"And Hermes, who was sent to be her guide"
5323,DECEMBER,"Ifso she lived, came down at eventide,"
5324,DECEMBER,And bore her thither ere the close of day.
5325,DECEMBER,
5326,DECEMBER,
5327,DECEMBER,17
5328,DECEMBER,
5329,DECEMBER,But when the goddess saw the locks of gold
5330,DECEMBER,"Held to her hands, her heart with wrath o’erran:"
5331,DECEMBER,"‘Most desperate thou, and by abetting bold,"
5332,DECEMBER,"That dost outwit me, prove thee as I can."
5333,DECEMBER,Yet this work is not thine: there is but one
5334,DECEMBER,Of all the gods who coud the thing have done.
5335,DECEMBER,Hast thou a friend too in the lusty Pan?
5336,DECEMBER,
5337,DECEMBER,
5338,DECEMBER,18
5339,DECEMBER,
5340,DECEMBER,‘I’ll give thee trial where he cannot aid.’
5341,DECEMBER,"Which said, she led her to a torrid land,"
5342,DECEMBER,"Level and black, but not with flood or shade,"
5343,DECEMBER,"For nothing coud the mighty heat withstand,"
5344,DECEMBER,Which aye from morn till eve the naked sun
5345,DECEMBER,"Pour’d on that plain, where never foot had run,"
5346,DECEMBER,Nor any herb sprung on its molten sand.
5347,DECEMBER,
5348,DECEMBER,
5349,DECEMBER,19
5350,DECEMBER,
5351,DECEMBER,Far off a gloomy mountain rose alone:
5352,DECEMBER,"And Aphrodite, thither pointing, said"
5353,DECEMBER,‘There lies thy task. Out of the topmost stone
5354,DECEMBER,Of yonder hill upwells a fountain head.
5355,DECEMBER,Take thou this goblet; brimming must thou bring
5356,DECEMBER,"Its cup with water from that sacred spring,"
5357,DECEMBER,If ever to my son thou wouldst be wed.’
5358,DECEMBER,
5359,DECEMBER,
5360,DECEMBER,20
5361,DECEMBER,
5362,DECEMBER,"Saying, she gave into her hands a bowl"
5363,DECEMBER,"Cut of one crystal, open, broad and fair;"
5364,DECEMBER,"And bade her at all hazard keep it whole,"
5365,DECEMBER,For heaven held nought beside so fine or rare.
5366,DECEMBER,Then was she gone; and Psyche on the plain
5367,DECEMBER,Now doubted if she ever should regain
5368,DECEMBER,"The love of Eros, strove she howsoe’er."
5369,DECEMBER,
5370,DECEMBER,
5371,DECEMBER,21
5372,DECEMBER,
5373,DECEMBER,"Yet as a helmsman, at the word to tack,"
5374,DECEMBER,"Swiftly without a thought puts down his helm,"
5375,DECEMBER,"So Psyche turn’d to tread that desert black,"
5376,DECEMBER,Since was no fear that coud her heart o’erwhelm;
5377,DECEMBER,Nor knew she that she went the fount to seek
5378,DECEMBER,"Of cold Cocytus, springing to the peak,"
5379,DECEMBER,Secretly from his source in Pluto’s realm.
5380,DECEMBER,
5381,DECEMBER,
5382,DECEMBER,22
5383,DECEMBER,
5384,DECEMBER,"All night and day she journey’d, and at last"
5385,DECEMBER,Come to the rock gazed up in vain around:
5386,DECEMBER,Nothing she saw but precipices vast
5387,DECEMBER,"O’er ruined scarps, with rugged ridges crown’d:"
5388,DECEMBER,"And creeping to a cleft to rest in shade,"
5389,DECEMBER,"Or e’er the desperate venture she assay’d,"
5390,DECEMBER,She fell asleep upon the stony ground.
5391,DECEMBER,
5392,DECEMBER,
5393,DECEMBER,23
5394,DECEMBER,
5395,DECEMBER,"A dream came to her, thus: she stood alone"
5396,DECEMBER,Within her palace in the high ravine;
5397,DECEMBER,"Where nought but she was changed, but she to stone."
5398,DECEMBER,"Worshippers throng’d the court, and still were seen"
5399,DECEMBER,"Folk flying from the peak, who, ever more"
5400,DECEMBER,"Flying and flying, lighted on the floor,"
5401,DECEMBER,"_Hail!_ cried they, _wife of Eros, adorèd queen!_"
5402,DECEMBER,
5403,DECEMBER,
5404,DECEMBER,24
5405,DECEMBER,
5406,DECEMBER,A hurtling of the battl’d air disturb’d
5407,DECEMBER,"Her sunken sense, and waked her eyes to meet"
5408,DECEMBER,"The kingly bird of Zeus, himself that curb’d"
5409,DECEMBER,"His swooping course, alighting at her feet;"
5410,DECEMBER,"With motion gentle, his far-darting eye"
5411,DECEMBER,"In kindness dim’d upon her, he drew nigh,"
5412,DECEMBER,And thus in words unveil’d her foe’s deceit:
5413,DECEMBER,
5414,DECEMBER,
5415,DECEMBER,25
5416,DECEMBER,
5417,DECEMBER,
5418,DECEMBER,"‘In vain, poor Psyche, hast thou hither striven"

5420,DECEMBER,Cruelly to destruction art thou driven
5421,DECEMBER,"By her, whose hate thou canst not quit nor quell."
5422,DECEMBER,"No mortal foot may scale this horrid mount,"
5423,DECEMBER,And those black waters of its topmost fount
5424,DECEMBER,Are guarded by the hornèd snakes of hell.
5425,DECEMBER,
5426,DECEMBER,
5427,DECEMBER,26
5428,DECEMBER,
5429,DECEMBER,‘Its little rill is an upleaping jet
5430,DECEMBER,"Of cold Cocytus, which for ever licks"
5431,DECEMBER,"Earth’s base, and when with Acheron ’tis met,"
5432,DECEMBER,"Its waters with that other cannot mix,"
5433,DECEMBER,Which holds the elemental air dissolved;
5434,DECEMBER,But with it in its ceaseless course revolved
5435,DECEMBER,Issues unmingl’d in the lake of Styx.

5443,DECEMBER,Of them they murder’d on the earth of old:
5444,DECEMBER,"Whom each five years they see, whene’er they make"
5445,DECEMBER,"Their passage to the Acherusian lake,"
5446,DECEMBER,And there release may win from pains condoled.
5447,DECEMBER,
5448,DECEMBER,
5449,DECEMBER,28
5450,DECEMBER,

5497,JANUARY,
5498,JANUARY,1
5499,JANUARY,
5500,JANUARY,"But Eros now recover’d from his hurt,"
5501,JANUARY,Felt other pangs; for who would not relent
5502,JANUARY,Weighing the small crime and unmatch’d desert
5503,JANUARY,Of Psyche with her cruel punishment?
5504,JANUARY,And shamed he grew to be so near allied
5505,JANUARY,"To her, who by her taunts awoke his pride,"
5506,JANUARY,As his compassion by her spite unspent.
5507,JANUARY,
5508,JANUARY,
5509,JANUARY,2
5510,JANUARY,
5511,JANUARY,"Which Aphrodite seeing, wax’d more firm"
5512,JANUARY,That he should never meet with Psyche more;
5513,JANUARY,And had in thought already set the term
5514,JANUARY,"To their communion with that trial sore,"
5515,JANUARY,"Which sent her forth upon a quest accurst,"
5516,JANUARY,"And not to be accomplisht, that of thirst"
5517,JANUARY,She there might perish on hell’s torrid shore.
5518,JANUARY,
5519,JANUARY,
5520,JANUARY,3
5521,JANUARY,
5522,JANUARY,And now it chanced that she had called her son
5523,JANUARY,"Into her presence-chamber, to unfold"
5524,JANUARY,"Psyche’s destruction, that her fate might stun"
5525,JANUARY,What love remained by duty uncontrol’d;
5526,JANUARY,And he to hide his tears’ rebellious storm
5527,JANUARY,Was fled; when in his place another form
5528,JANUARY,Rose ’neath the golden lintel; and behold
5529,JANUARY,
5530,JANUARY,
5531,JANUARY,4
5532,JANUARY,
5533,JANUARY,"Psyche herself, in slow and balanced strain,"
5534,JANUARY,"Poising the crystal bowl with fearful heed,"
5535,JANUARY,"Her eyes at watch upon the steadied plane,"
5536,JANUARY,And whole soul gather’d in the single deed.
5537,JANUARY,"Onward she came, and stooping to the floor"
5538,JANUARY,Set down the cup unspill’d and brimming o’er
5539,JANUARY,"At Aphrodite’s feet, and rose up freed."
5540,JANUARY,
5541,JANUARY,
5542,JANUARY,5
5543,JANUARY,
5544,JANUARY,"Surprise o’ercame the goddess, and she too"
5545,JANUARY,"Stood like a statue, but with passion pale:"
5546,JANUARY,"Till, when her victim nothing spake, she threw"
5547,JANUARY,"Some kindness in her voice, and bade her hail;"
5548,JANUARY,But in the smiling judge ’twas plain to see--
5549,JANUARY,Saying ‘What water bringst thou here to me?’—
5550,JANUARY,That justice over hate should not prevail.
5551,JANUARY,
5552,JANUARY,
5553,JANUARY,6
5554,JANUARY,
5555,JANUARY,Then Psyche said ‘This is the biting flood
5556,JANUARY,"Of black Cocytus, silver’d with the gleam"
5557,JANUARY,"Of souls, that guilty of another’s blood"
5558,JANUARY,"Are pent therein, and as they swim they scream."
5559,JANUARY,"The hornèd snakes of hell, upon the mount"
5560,JANUARY,"Enchain’d, for ever guard the livid fount:"
5561,JANUARY,And but the Fates can grant to touch the stream.’
5562,JANUARY,
5563,JANUARY,
5564,JANUARY,7
5565,JANUARY,
5566,JANUARY,"‘Wherefore,’ the goddess cried, ‘’tis plain that none"
5567,JANUARY,But one I wot of coud this thing have wrought.
5568,JANUARY,"That which another doth may well be done,"
5569,JANUARY,Nor thou the nearer to my promise brought.
5570,JANUARY,"Thou buildest on a hope to be destroy’d,"
5571,JANUARY,"If thou accept conditions, and avoid"
5572,JANUARY,"Thy parcel, nor thyself accomplish aught."
5573,JANUARY,
5574,JANUARY,
5575,JANUARY,8
5576,JANUARY,
5577,JANUARY,"‘Was it not kindness in me, being averse"
5578,JANUARY,"To all thy wish, to yield me thus to grant"
5579,JANUARY,"Thy heart’s desire,--and nothing loathe I worse,—"
5580,JANUARY,If thou wouldst only work as well as want?
5581,JANUARY,"See, now I will not yet be all denial,"
5582,JANUARY,But offer thee one last determining trial;
5583,JANUARY,And let it be a mutual covenant:
5584,JANUARY,
5585,JANUARY,
5586,JANUARY,9
5587,JANUARY,
5588,JANUARY,"‘This box,’ and in her hands she took a pyx"
5589,JANUARY,"Square-cut, of dark obsidian’s rarest green,"
5590,JANUARY,‘Take; and therewith beyond Tartarean Styx
5591,JANUARY,"Go thou, and entering Hades’ house obscene,"
5592,JANUARY,"Say to Persephonè, _If ’tis thy will"
5593,JANUARY,"To shew me so much favour, prithee fill"
5594,JANUARY,This little vase with beauty for Love’s queen_.
5595,JANUARY,
5596,JANUARY,
5597,JANUARY,10
5598,JANUARY,
5599,JANUARY,‘_She begs but what shall well o’erlast a day;
5600,JANUARY,For of her own was much of late outspent
5601,JANUARY,"In nursing of her son, in bed who lay"
5602,JANUARY,"Wounded by me, who for the gift am sent._"
5603,JANUARY,"Then bring me what she gives, and with all speed;"
5604,JANUARY,"For truth to say I stand, thou seest, in need"
5605,JANUARY,Of some such charm in my disparagement.
5606,JANUARY,
5607,JANUARY,
5608,JANUARY,11
5609,JANUARY,
5610,JANUARY,"‘If thou return to me with that acquist,"
5611,JANUARY,"Having thyself the journey made, I swear"
5612,JANUARY,"That day to give thee whatsoe’er thou list,"
5613,JANUARY,"An be it my son. Now, Psyche, wilt thou dare?’"
5614,JANUARY,"And Psyche said ‘If this thou truly mean,"
5615,JANUARY,"I will go down to Tartarus obscene,"
5616,JANUARY,And beg of Hades’ queen thy beauty there.
5617,JANUARY,
5618,JANUARY,
5619,JANUARY,12
5620,JANUARY,
5621,JANUARY,"‘Show me the way.’ But Aphrodite said,"
5622,JANUARY,‘That mayst thou find. Yet I will place thee whence
5623,JANUARY,A way there is: mortals have on it sped;
5624,JANUARY,"Ay, and return’d thereby: so let us hence.’"
5625,JANUARY,"Then swift to earth her willing prey she bore,"
5626,JANUARY,"And left her on the wide Laconian shore,"
5627,JANUARY,"Alone, at midnight, in the darkness dense."
5628,JANUARY,
5629,JANUARY,
5630,JANUARY,13
5631,JANUARY,
5632,JANUARY,’Twas winter; and as shivering Psyche sat
5633,JANUARY,"Waiting for morn, she question’d in her mind"
5634,JANUARY,"What place the goddess meant, arrived whereat"
5635,JANUARY,"She might descend to hell, or how should find"
5636,JANUARY,The way which Gods to living men deny.
5637,JANUARY,"‘No Orpheus, nay, nor Hercules am I,’"
5638,JANUARY,"Said she,‘to loosen where the great Gods bind.’"
5639,JANUARY,
5640,JANUARY,
5641,JANUARY,14
5642,JANUARY,
5643,JANUARY,And when at length the long-delaying dawn
5644,JANUARY,"Broke on the peaks of huge Taÿgetus,"
5645,JANUARY,And Psyche through the skirts of dark withdrawn
5646,JANUARY,"Look’d on that promontory mountainous,"
5647,JANUARY,"And saw high-crested Taleton in snow,"
5648,JANUARY,"Her heart sank, and she wept with head bent low"
5649,JANUARY,The malice of her foe dispiteous.
5650,JANUARY,
5651,JANUARY,
5652,JANUARY,15
5653,JANUARY,
5654,JANUARY,"And seeing near at hand an ancient tower,"
5655,JANUARY,"Deserted now, but once a hold of men,"
5656,JANUARY,"She came thereto, and, though ’twas all her power,"
5657,JANUARY,Mounted its steep unbroken stair again.
5658,JANUARY,"‘Surely,’ she said, for now a second time"
5659,JANUARY,She thought to die--‘this little height I climb
5660,JANUARY,Will prove my shortest road to Pluto’s den.
5661,JANUARY,
5662,JANUARY,
5663,JANUARY,16
5664,JANUARY,
5665,JANUARY,‘Hence must I come to Tartarus; once there
5666,JANUARY,"Turn as I may,’ and straight to death had sprung;"
5667,JANUARY,When in the mossy tower the imprison’d air
5668,JANUARY,"Was shaken, and the hoary stones gave tongue,"
5669,JANUARY,‘Stand firm! stand firm!’ that rugged voice outcried;
5670,JANUARY,‘Of such as choose despondency for guide
5671,JANUARY,Hast thou not heard what bitterest fate is sung?
5672,JANUARY,
5673,JANUARY,
5674,JANUARY,17
5675,JANUARY,
5676,JANUARY,‘Hearken; for I the road and means can teach
5677,JANUARY,How thou mayst come to hell and yet escape.
5678,JANUARY,"And first must thou, that upper gate to reach,"
5679,JANUARY,"Along these seagirt hills thy journey shape,"
5680,JANUARY,To where the land in sea dips furthest South
5681,JANUARY,"At Tænarus and Hades’ earthly mouth,"
5682,JANUARY,Hard by Poseidon’s temple at the cape.
5683,JANUARY,
5684,JANUARY,
5685,JANUARY,18
5686,JANUARY,
5687,JANUARY,‘Thereby may one descend: but they that make
5688,JANUARY,That passage down must go provided well.
5689,JANUARY,So take in either hand a honey-cake
5690,JANUARY,Of pearlèd barley mix’d with hydromel;
5691,JANUARY,"And in thy mouth two doits, first having bound"
5692,JANUARY,The pyx beneath thy robe enwrap’d around:
5693,JANUARY,Thus set thou forth; and mark what more I tell.
5694,JANUARY,
5695,JANUARY,
5696,JANUARY,19
5697,JANUARY,
5698,JANUARY,‘When thou hast gone alone some half thy road
5699,JANUARY,Thou wilt o’ertake a lame outwearied ass;
5700,JANUARY,"And one that beats him, tottering ’neath his load"
5701,JANUARY,"Of loosely bundl’d wood, will cry _Alas;"
5702,JANUARY,"Help me, kind friend, my faggots to adjust!_"
5703,JANUARY,But thou that silly cripple’s words mistrust;
5704,JANUARY,’Tis planted for thy death. Note it and pass.

5708,JANUARY,
5709,JANUARY,"‘And when thy road the Stygian river joins,"
5710,JANUARY,"Where woolly Charon ferries o’er the dead,"
5711,JANUARY,He will demand his fare: one of thy coins
5712,JANUARY,"Force with thy tongue between thy teeth, thy head"
5713,JANUARY,Offering instead of hand to give the doit.
5714,JANUARY,"His fingers in this custom are adroit,"
5715,JANUARY,And thine must not set down the barleybread.
5716,JANUARY,
5717,JANUARY,
5718,JANUARY,21
5719,JANUARY,
5720,JANUARY,"‘Then in his crazy bark as, ferrying o’er"
5721,JANUARY,"The stream, thou sittest, one that seems to float"
5722,JANUARY,"Rather than swim, midway ’twixt shore and shore,"
5723,JANUARY,"Will stretch his fleshless hand upon the boat,"
5724,JANUARY,And beg thee of thy pity take him in.
5725,JANUARY,"Shut thy soft ear unto his clamour thin,"
5726,JANUARY,Nor for a phantom deed thyself devote.

5728,JANUARY,
5729,JANUARY,22
5730,JANUARY,
5731,JANUARY,"‘Next, on the further bank when thou art stept,"
5732,JANUARY,Three wizen’d women weaving at the woof
5733,JANUARY,"Will stop, and pray thee in their art adept"
5734,JANUARY,To free their tangl’d threads. Hold thou aloof;
5735,JANUARY,For this and other traps thy foe hath plan’d
5736,JANUARY,"To make thee drop the cakes out of thy hand,"
5737,JANUARY,Putting thy prudence to perpetual proof.
5738,JANUARY,
5739,JANUARY,
5740,JANUARY,23
5741,JANUARY,
5742,JANUARY,"‘For by one cake thou comest into Hell,"
5743,JANUARY,And by one cake departest; since the hound
5744,JANUARY,That guards the gate is ever pleasèd well
5745,JANUARY,"To taste man’s meal, or sweeten’d grain unground."
5746,JANUARY,Cast him a cake; for that thou mayst go free
5747,JANUARY,"Even to the mansion of Persephonè,"
5748,JANUARY,"Withouten stay or peril, safe and sound."
5749,JANUARY,
5750,JANUARY,
5751,JANUARY,24
5752,JANUARY,
5753,JANUARY,‘She will receive thee kindly; thou decline
5754,JANUARY,"Her courtesies, and make the floor thy seat;"
5755,JANUARY,"Refusing what is offer’d, food or wine;"
5756,JANUARY,Save only beg a crust of bread to eat.
5757,JANUARY,"Then tell thy mission, and her present take;"
5758,JANUARY,"Which when thou hast, set forth with pyx and cake,"
5759,JANUARY,"One in each hand, while yet thou mayst retreat."

5765,JANUARY,"The coin to Charon, and that way whereby"
5766,JANUARY,"Thou earnest following, thou comest thus"
5767,JANUARY,To see again the starry choir on high.
5768,JANUARY,"But guard thou well the pyx, nor once uplift"
5769,JANUARY,The lid to look on Persephassa’s gift;
5770,JANUARY,Else ’tis in vain I bid thee now not die.’
5771,JANUARY,
5772,JANUARY,26
5773,JANUARY,
5774,JANUARY,"Then Psyche thank’d the tower, and stoopt her mouth"
5775,JANUARY,To kiss the stones upon his rampart hoary;
5776,JANUARY,"And coming down his stair went hasting south,"
5777,JANUARY,Along the steep Tænarian promontory;
5778,JANUARY,"And found the cave and temple by the cape,"
5779,JANUARY,"And took the cakes and coins, and made escape"
5780,JANUARY,"Beneath the earth, according to his story."
5781,JANUARY,
5782,JANUARY,
5783,JANUARY,27
5784,JANUARY,
5785,JANUARY,"And overtook the ass, but lent no aid;"
5786,JANUARY,And offer’d Charon with her teeth his fee;
5787,JANUARY,"And pass’d the floating ghost, in vain who pray’d;"
5788,JANUARY,And turned her back upon the weavers three:
5789,JANUARY,And threw the honey-cake to that hell-hound
5790,JANUARY,"Three-headed Cerberus; and safe and sound,"
5791,JANUARY,Came to the mansion of Persephonè.
5792,JANUARY,
5793,JANUARY,
5794,JANUARY,28
5795,JANUARY,
5796,JANUARY,"Kindly received, she courtesy declined;"
5797,JANUARY,"Sat on the ground; ate not, save where she lay,"
5798,JANUARY,A crust of bread; reveal’d the goddess’ mind;
5799,JANUARY,The gift took; and return’d upon her way:
5800,JANUARY,"Gave Cerberus his cake, Charon his fare,"
5801,JANUARY,And saw through Hell’s mouth to the purple air
5802,JANUARY,And one by one the keen stars melt in day.
5803,JANUARY,
5804,JANUARY,
5805,JANUARY,29
5806,JANUARY,
5807,JANUARY,Awhile from so long journeying in the shades
5808,JANUARY,Resting at Tænarus she came to know
5809,JANUARY,"How, up the eastern coast some forty stades,"
5810,JANUARY,There stood a temple of her goddess foe.
5811,JANUARY,"There would she make her offering, there reclaim"
5812,JANUARY,"The prize, which now ’twas happiness to name,"
5813,JANUARY,The joy that should redeem all passèd woe.
5814,JANUARY,
5815,JANUARY,
5816,JANUARY,30
5817,JANUARY,
5818,JANUARY,"And wending by the sunny shore at noon,"
5819,JANUARY,"She with her pyx, and wondering what it hid,"
5820,JANUARY,"Of what kind, what the fashion of the boon"
5821,JANUARY,"Coud be, that she to look on was forbid,—"
5822,JANUARY,Alas for Innocence so hard to teach!—
5823,JANUARY,"At fancy’s prick she sat her on the beach,"
5824,JANUARY,And to content desire lifted the lid.
5825,JANUARY,
5826,JANUARY,
5827,JANUARY,31
5828,JANUARY,
5829,JANUARY,She saw within nothing: But o’er her sight
5830,JANUARY,That looked on nothing gan a darkness creep.
5831,JANUARY,"A cloudy poison, mix’d of Stygian night,"
5832,JANUARY,Rapt her to deadly and infernal sleep.
5833,JANUARY,"Backward she fell, like one when all is o’er,"
5834,JANUARY,"And lay outstretch’d, as lies upon the shore"
5835,JANUARY,A drown’d corpse cast up by the murmuring deep.

5844,FEBRUARY,
5845,FEBRUARY,"While Eros in his chamber hid his tears,"
5846,FEBRUARY,"Mourning the loss of Psyche and her fate,"
5847,FEBRUARY,The rumour of her safety reacht his ears
5848,FEBRUARY,And how she came to Aphrodite’s gate:
5849,FEBRUARY,"Whereat with hope return’d his hardihood,"
5850,FEBRUARY,And secretly he purposed while he coud
5851,FEBRUARY,Himself to save her from the goddess’ hate.
5852,FEBRUARY,
5853,FEBRUARY,
5854,FEBRUARY,2
5855,FEBRUARY,
5856,FEBRUARY,"Then learning what he might and guessing more,"
5857,FEBRUARY,His ready wit came soon to understand
5858,FEBRUARY,The journey to the far Laconian shore;
5859,FEBRUARY,Whither to fly and seek his love he plan’d:
5860,FEBRUARY,"And making good escape in dark of night,"
5861,FEBRUARY,Ere the sun crost his true meridian flight
5862,FEBRUARY,He by Teuthronè struck the southern strand.
5863,FEBRUARY,
5864,FEBRUARY,
5865,FEBRUARY,3
5866,FEBRUARY,
5867,FEBRUARY,There as it chanct he found that snowy bird
5868,FEBRUARY,"Of Crete, that late made mischief with his queen,"
5869,FEBRUARY,And now along the cliffs with wings unstir’d
5870,FEBRUARY,"Sail’d, and that morn had cross’d the sea between:"
5871,FEBRUARY,"Whom as he past he hail’d, and question’d thus,"
5872,FEBRUARY,"‘O snowy gull, if thou from Tænarus"
5873,FEBRUARY,"Be come, say, hast thou there my Psyche seen?’"
5874,FEBRUARY,
5875,FEBRUARY,
5876,FEBRUARY,4
5877,FEBRUARY,
5878,FEBRUARY,The gull replied ‘Thy Psyche have I seen;
5879,FEBRUARY,Walking beside the sea she joy’th to bear
5880,FEBRUARY,"A pyx of dark obsidian’s rarest green,"
5881,FEBRUARY,Wherein she gazeth on her features fair.
5882,FEBRUARY,She is not hence by now six miles at most.’
5883,FEBRUARY,"Then Eros bade him speed, and down the coast"
5884,FEBRUARY,Held on his passage through the buoyant air.
5885,FEBRUARY,
5886,FEBRUARY,
5887,FEBRUARY,5
5888,FEBRUARY,
5889,FEBRUARY,With eager eye he search’d the salty marge
5890,FEBRUARY,Boding all mischief from his mother’s glee;
5891,FEBRUARY,"And wondering of her wiles, and what the charge"
5892,FEBRUARY,Shut in the dark obsidian pyx might be.
5893,FEBRUARY,"And lo! at last, outstretch’d beside the rocks,"
5894,FEBRUARY,Psyche as lifeless; and the open box
5895,FEBRUARY,Laid with the weedy refuse of the sea.
5896,FEBRUARY,
5897,FEBRUARY,
5898,FEBRUARY,6
5899,FEBRUARY,
5900,FEBRUARY,"He guess’d all, flew down, and beside her knelt."
5901,FEBRUARY,With both his hands stroking her temples wan;
5902,FEBRUARY,"And for the poison with his fingers felt,"
5903,FEBRUARY,And drew it gently from her; and anon
5904,FEBRUARY,She slowly from those Stygian fumes was freed;
5905,FEBRUARY,Which he with magic handling and good heed
5906,FEBRUARY,"Replaced in pyx, and shut the lid thereon."
5907,FEBRUARY,
5908,FEBRUARY,
5909,FEBRUARY,7
5910,FEBRUARY,
5911,FEBRUARY,"‘O Psyche,’ thus, and kissing her he cried,"
5912,FEBRUARY,"‘O simple-hearted Psyche, once again"
5913,FEBRUARY,"Hast thou thy foolish longing gratified,"
5914,FEBRUARY,A second time hath prying been thy bane.
5915,FEBRUARY,"But lo! I, love, am come, for I am thine:"
5916,FEBRUARY,"Nor ever more shall any fate malign,"
5917,FEBRUARY,Or spite of goddess smite our love in twain.
5918,FEBRUARY,
5919,FEBRUARY,
5920,FEBRUARY,8
5921,FEBRUARY,
5922,FEBRUARY,‘Let now that I have saved thee twice outweigh
5923,FEBRUARY,The once that I deserted thee: and thou
5924,FEBRUARY,"Hast much obey’d for once to disobey,"
5925,FEBRUARY,And wilt no more my bidding disallow.
5926,FEBRUARY,"Take up thy pyx; to Aphrodite go,"
5927,FEBRUARY,And claim the promise of thy mighty foe;
5928,FEBRUARY,Maybe that she will grant it to thee now.
5929,FEBRUARY,
5930,FEBRUARY,
5931,FEBRUARY,9
5932,FEBRUARY,
5933,FEBRUARY,"‘If she should yet refuse, despair not yet!’"
5934,FEBRUARY,"Then Psyche, when she felt his arms restore"
5935,FEBRUARY,"Their old embrace, and as their bodies met,"
5936,FEBRUARY,Knew the great joy that grief is pardon’d for;
5937,FEBRUARY,"And how it doth first ecstasy excel,"
5938,FEBRUARY,"When love well-known, long-lost, and mournèd well"
5939,FEBRUARY,"In long days of no hope, comes home once more."
5940,FEBRUARY,
5941,FEBRUARY,
5942,FEBRUARY,10
5943,FEBRUARY,
5944,FEBRUARY,But Eros leaping up with purpose keen
5945,FEBRUARY,"Into the air, as only love can fly,"
5946,FEBRUARY,"Bore her to heaven, and setting her unseen"
5947,FEBRUARY,"At Aphrodite’s golden gate,--whereby"
5948,FEBRUARY,"They came as night was close on twilight dim,—"
5949,FEBRUARY,"There left, and bidding her say nought of him,"
5950,FEBRUARY,Went onward to the house of Zeus most high.
5951,FEBRUARY,
5952,FEBRUARY,
5953,FEBRUARY,11
5954,FEBRUARY,
5955,FEBRUARY,"Where winning audience of the heavenly sire,"
5956,FEBRUARY,"Who well disposed to him was used to be,"
5957,FEBRUARY,He told the story of his strong desire;
5958,FEBRUARY,"And boldly begg’d that Zeus would grant his plea,"
5959,FEBRUARY,"That he might have sweet Psyche for his wife,"
5960,FEBRUARY,"And she be dower’d with immortal life,"
5961,FEBRUARY,"Since she was worthy, by his firm decree."
5962,FEBRUARY,
5963,FEBRUARY,
5964,FEBRUARY,12
5965,FEBRUARY,
5966,FEBRUARY,And great Zeus smiled; and at the smile of Zeus
5967,FEBRUARY,"All heaven was glad, and on the earth below"
5968,FEBRUARY,Was calm and peace awhile and sorrow’s truce:
5969,FEBRUARY,"The sun shone forth and smote the winter snow,"
5970,FEBRUARY,"The flowërs sprang, the birds gan sing and pair,"
5971,FEBRUARY,"And mortals, as they drew the brighten’d air,"
5972,FEBRUARY,"Marvel’d, and quite forgot their common woe."
5973,FEBRUARY,
5974,FEBRUARY,
5975,FEBRUARY,13
5976,FEBRUARY,
5977,FEBRUARY,Yet gave the Thunderer not his full consent
5978,FEBRUARY,"Without some words: ‘At length is come the day,’"
5979,FEBRUARY,"Thus spake he, ‘when for all thy youth misspent,"
5980,FEBRUARY,Thy mischief-making and thy wanton play
5981,FEBRUARY,Thou art upgrown to taste the sweet and sour:
5982,FEBRUARY,Good shall it work upon thee: from this hour
5983,FEBRUARY,"Look we for better things. And this I say,"
5984,FEBRUARY,
5985,FEBRUARY,
5986,FEBRUARY,14
5987,FEBRUARY,
5988,FEBRUARY,"‘That since thy birth, which all we took for bliss,"
5989,FEBRUARY,Thou hast but mock’d us; and no less on me
5990,FEBRUARY,"Hast brought disfavour and contempt, ywiss,"
5991,FEBRUARY,Than others that have had to do with thee:
5992,FEBRUARY,Till only such as vow’d themselves aloof
5993,FEBRUARY,From thee and thine were held in good aproof;
5994,FEBRUARY,"And few there were, who thus of shame went free."
5995,FEBRUARY,
5996,FEBRUARY,
5997,FEBRUARY,15
5998,FEBRUARY,
5999,FEBRUARY,‘That punishment is shapen as reward
6000,FEBRUARY,Is like thy fortune: but our good estate
6001,FEBRUARY,"We honour, while we sit to be adored:"
6002,FEBRUARY,And thus ’twas written in the book of Fate.
6003,FEBRUARY,"Not for thy pleasure, but the general weal"
6004,FEBRUARY,Grant I the grace for which thou here dost kneel;

6012,FEBRUARY,"Where they should Psyche see with Eros wed,"
6013,FEBRUARY,And keep the day with feast ambrosial.
6014,FEBRUARY,"And Hermes, flying through the skiey ways"
6015,FEBRUARY,"Of high Olympus, spread sweet Psyche’s praise,"
6016,FEBRUARY,And bade the mighty gods obey his call.
6017,FEBRUARY,
6018,FEBRUARY,
6019,FEBRUARY,17
6020,FEBRUARY,
6021,FEBRUARY,Then all the Kronian gods and goddesses
6022,FEBRUARY,"Assembl’d at his cry,--and now ’twas known"
6023,FEBRUARY,"Why Zeus had smiled,--the lesser majesties"
6024,FEBRUARY,Attending them before his royal throne.
6025,FEBRUARY,"Athena, mistress good of them that know,"
6026,FEBRUARY,"Came, and Apollo, warder off of woe,"
6027,FEBRUARY,Who had to Psyche’s sire her fate foreshown;
6028,FEBRUARY,
6029,FEBRUARY,
6030,FEBRUARY,18
6031,FEBRUARY,
6032,FEBRUARY,"Demeter, giver of the golden com,"
6033,FEBRUARY,"Fair Hebe, honour’d at her Attic shrine,"

6035,FEBRUARY,"And Dionysos, planter of the vine,"
6036,FEBRUARY,"With old Poseidon from the barren sea,"
6037,FEBRUARY,"And Leto, and the lame Hephæstos, he"
6038,FEBRUARY,Himself who built those halls with skill divine.
6039,FEBRUARY,
6040,FEBRUARY,
6041,FEBRUARY,19
6042,FEBRUARY,
6043,FEBRUARY,And ruddy Pan with many a quip and quirk
6044,FEBRUARY,"Air’d ’mong those lofty gods his mirth illbred,"
6045,FEBRUARY,Bearing a mighty bowl of cretan work:
6046,FEBRUARY,"Stern Arês, with his crisp hair helmeted,"
6047,FEBRUARY,"Came, and retirèd Hestia, and the god"
6048,FEBRUARY,"Hermes, with wingèd cap and ribbon’d rod,"
6049,FEBRUARY,By whom the company was heralded.
6050,FEBRUARY,
6051,FEBRUARY,
6052,FEBRUARY,20
6053,FEBRUARY,
6054,FEBRUARY,"And Hera sat by Zeus, and all around"
6055,FEBRUARY,"The Muses, that of learning make their choice;"
6056,FEBRUARY,"Who, when Apollo struck his strings to sound,"
6057,FEBRUARY,Sang in alternate music with sweet voice:
6058,FEBRUARY,"And righteous Themis, and the Graces three"
6059,FEBRUARY,Ushering the anger’d Aphrodite; she
6060,FEBRUARY,Alone of all were there might not rejoice.
6061,FEBRUARY,
6062,FEBRUARY,
6063,FEBRUARY,21
6064,FEBRUARY,
6065,FEBRUARY,"But ere they sat to feast, Zeus bade them fill"
6066,FEBRUARY,"The cup ambrosial of immortal life,"
6067,FEBRUARY,"And said ‘If Psyche drink,--and ’tis my will,—"
6068,FEBRUARY,There is an end of this unhappy strife.
6069,FEBRUARY,"Nor can the goddess, whose mislike had birth"
6070,FEBRUARY,"From too great honour paid the bride on earth,"
6071,FEBRUARY,Forbid her any more for Eros’ wife.’
6072,FEBRUARY,
6073,FEBRUARY,
6074,FEBRUARY,22
6075,FEBRUARY,
6076,FEBRUARY,Then Aphrodite said ‘So let it be.’
6077,FEBRUARY,"And Psyche was brought in, with such a flush"
6078,FEBRUARY,"Of joy upon her face, as there to see"
6079,FEBRUARY,Was fairer to love’s eye than beauty’s blush.
6080,FEBRUARY,"And then she drank the eternal wine, whose draught"
6081,FEBRUARY,"Can Terror cease: which flesh hath never quafft,"
6082,FEBRUARY,Nor doth it flow from grape that mortals crush.
6083,FEBRUARY,
6084,FEBRUARY,
6085,FEBRUARY,23
6086,FEBRUARY,
6087,FEBRUARY,"And next stood Eros forth, and took her hand,"
6088,FEBRUARY,And kisst her happy face before them all:
6089,FEBRUARY,"And Zeus proclaim’d them married, and outban’d"
6090,FEBRUARY,From heaven whoever should that word miscall.
6091,FEBRUARY,"And then all sat to feast, and one by one"
6092,FEBRUARY,Pledged Psyche ere they drank and cried _Well done_!
6093,FEBRUARY,And merry laughter rang throughout the hall.
6094,FEBRUARY,
6095,FEBRUARY,
6096,FEBRUARY,24
6097,FEBRUARY,
6098,FEBRUARY,"So thus was Eros unto Psyche wed,"
6099,FEBRUARY,"The heavenly bridegroom to his earthly bride,"
6100,FEBRUARY,"Who won his love, in simple maidenhead:"
6101,FEBRUARY,"And by her love herself she glorified,"
6102,FEBRUARY,And him from wanton wildness disinclined;
6103,FEBRUARY,Since in his love for her he came to find
6104,FEBRUARY,A joy unknown through all Olympus wide.
6105,FEBRUARY,
6106,FEBRUARY,
6107,FEBRUARY,25
6108,FEBRUARY,
6109,FEBRUARY,"And Psyche for her fall was quite forgiven,"
6110,FEBRUARY,"Since ’gainst herself when tempted to rebel,"
6111,FEBRUARY,"By others’ malice on her ruin driven,"
6112,FEBRUARY,Only of sweet simplicity she fell:—
6113,FEBRUARY,Wherein who fall may fall unto the skies;—
6114,FEBRUARY,"And being foolish she was yet most wise,"
6115,FEBRUARY,And took her trials patiently and well.
6116,FEBRUARY,
6117,FEBRUARY,
6118,FEBRUARY,26
6119,FEBRUARY,
6120,FEBRUARY,And Aphrodite since her full defeat
6121,FEBRUARY,"Is kinder and less jealous than before,"
6122,FEBRUARY,"And smiling on them both, calls Psyche sweet;"
6123,FEBRUARY,But thinks her son less manly than of yore:
6124,FEBRUARY,"Though still she holds his arm of some renown,"
6125,FEBRUARY,"When he goes smiting mortals up and down,"
6126,FEBRUARY,Piercing their marrow with his weapons sore.

6135,FEBRUARY,"Whom gently Eros shooteth, and apart"

6412,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But on short absence so could sense derange
6413,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That tears have graced the greeting of my heart;
6414,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"They were proud drops and had my leave to fall,"
6415,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Not on thy pity for my pain to call.

6417,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,

6419,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6420,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,When sometimes in an ancient house where state
6421,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"From noble ancestry is handed on,"
6422,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"We see but desolation thro’ the gate,"
6423,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And richest heirlooms all to ruin gone;
6424,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Because maybe some fancied shame or fear,"
6425,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Bred of disease or melancholy fate,"
6426,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Hath driven the owner from his rightful sphere
6427,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To wander nameless save to pity or hate:
6428,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6429,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"What is the wreck of all he hath in fief,"
6430,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,When he that hath is wrecking? nought is fine
6431,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Unto the sick, nor doth it burden grief"
6432,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That the house perish when the soul doth pine.
6433,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thus I my state despise, slain by a sting"
6434,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,So slight ’twould not have hurt a meaner thing.

6438,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6439,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Who builds a ship must first lay down the keel
6440,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of health, whereto the ribs of mirth are wed:"
6441,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And knit, with beams and knees of strength, a bed"
6442,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"For decks of purity, her floor and ceil."
6443,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Upon her masts, Adventure, Pride, and Zeal,"
6444,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To fortune’s wind the sails of purpose spread:
6445,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And at the prow make figured maidenhead
6446,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,O’erride the seas and answer to the wheel.
6447,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6448,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And let him deep in memory’s hold have stor’d
6449,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Water of Helicon: and let him fit
6450,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The needle that doth true with heaven accord:
6451,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Then bid her crew, love, diligence and wit"
6452,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"With justice, courage, temperance come aboard,"

6456,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,16
6457,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6458,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"This world is unto God a work of art,"
6459,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of which the unaccomplish’d heavenly plan
6460,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Is hid in life within the creature’s heart,"
6461,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And for perfection looketh unto man.
6462,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Ah me! those thousand ages: with what slow
6463,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Pains and persistence were his idols made,"
6464,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Destroy’d and made, ere ever he could know"
6465,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The mighty mother must be so obey’d.
6466,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6467,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,For lack of knowledge and thro’ little skill
6468,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,His childish mimicry outwent his aim;
6469,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,His effort shaped the genius of his will;
6470,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Till thro’ distinction and revolt he came,"
6471,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"True to his simple terms of good and ill,"
6472,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Seeking the face of Beauty without blame.

6477,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Say who be these light-bearded, sunburnt faces"
6478,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In negligent and travel-stain’d array,"
6479,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That in the city of Dante come to-day,"
6480,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Haughtily visiting her holy places?
6481,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"O these be noble men that hide their graces,"
6482,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"True England’s blood, her ancient glory’s stay,"
6483,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,By tales of fame diverted on their way
6484,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Home from the rule of oriental races.
6485,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6486,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Life-trifling lions these, of gentle eyes"
6487,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And motion delicate, but swift to fire"
6488,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"For honour, passionate where duty lies,"
6489,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Most loved and loving: and they quickly tire
6490,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of Florence, that she one day more denies"
6491,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The embrace of wife and son, of sister or sire."

6497,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,At forenoon overlooks the city of flowers
6498,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I sat, and gazing on her domes and towers"
6499,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Call’d up her famous children one by one:
6500,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And three who all the rest had far outdone,"
6501,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Mild Giotto first, who stole the morning hours,"
6502,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I saw, and god-like Buonarroti’s powers,"

6504,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6505,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Is all this glory, I said, another’s praise?"
6506,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Are these heroic triumphs things of old,"
6507,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And do I dead upon the living gaze?
6508,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Or rather doth the mind, that can behold"
6509,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The wondrous beauty of the works and days,"
6510,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Create the image that her thoughts enfold?

6514,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6515,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Rejoice, ye dead, where’er your spirits dwell,"

6519,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"’Tis ye that conquer’d have the powers of hell,"
6520,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Each with the special grace of your delight:
6521,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ye are the world’s creators, and thro’ might"
6522,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of everlasting love ye did excel.
6523,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6524,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Now ye are starry names, above the storm"

6526,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ye flit, in pictured truth and peaceful form,"
6527,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Wing’d with bright music and melodious song,—"
6528,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The flaming flowers of heaven, making May-dance"

6536,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But he that can do well taketh no pride,"
6537,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And see’th his error, undisturb’d by shame:"
6538,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"So poor’s the best that longest life can do,"

6556,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"All things as vanity, yet nothing vain:"
6557,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The world, set in thy heart, thy passionate strain"

6561,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6562,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Lo, Shakespeare, since thy time nature is loth"
6563,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To yield to art her fair supremacy;
6564,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,In conquering one thou hast so enrichèd both.
6565,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,What shall I say? for God--whose wise decree
6566,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Confirmeth all He did by all He doth--
6567,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Doubled His whole creation making thee.

6571,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6572,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I would be a bird, and straight on wings I arise,"
6573,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And carry purpose up to the ends of the air:
6574,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In calm and storm my sails I feather, and where"
6575,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,By freezing cliffs the unransom’d wreckage lies:
6576,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Or, strutting on hot meridian banks, surprise"
6577,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The silence: over plains in the moonlight bare
6578,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I chase my shadow, and perch where no bird dare"
6579,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,In treetops torn by fiercest winds of the skies.
6580,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6581,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Poor simple birds, foolish birds! then I cry,"
6582,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ye pretty pictures of delight, unstir’d"
6583,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,By the only joy of knowing that ye fly;
6584,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ye are not what ye are, but rather, sum’d in a word,"
6585,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The alphabet of a god’s idea, and I"

6591,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"O weary pilgrims, chanting of your woe,"
6592,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That turn your eyes to all the peaks that shine,"
6593,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Hailing in each the citadel divine
6594,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The which ye thought to have enter’d long ago;
6595,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Until at length your feeble steps and slow
6596,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Falter upon the threshold of the shrine,"
6597,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And your hearts overburden’d doubt in fine

6599,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6600,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Dishearten’d pilgrims, I am one of you;"
6601,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"For, having worshipp’d many a barren face,"
6602,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I scarce now greet the goal I journey’d to:
6603,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I stand a pagan in the holy place;
6604,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Beneath the lamp of truth I am found untrue,"
6605,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And question with the God that I embrace.

6607,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,

6610,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Spring hath her own bright days of calm and peace;
6611,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Her melting air, at every breath we draw,"
6612,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Floods heart with love to praise God’s gracious law:
6613,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But suddenly--so short is pleasure’s lease--
6614,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The cold returns, the buds from growing cease,"
6615,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And nature’s conquer’d face is full of awe;
6616,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,As now the traitrous north with icy flaw
6617,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Freezes the dew upon the sick lamb’s fleece,"
6618,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6619,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And ’neath the mock sun searching everywhere
6620,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Rattles the crispèd leaves with shivering din:
6621,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,So that the birds are silent with despair
6622,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Within the thickets; nor their armour thin
6623,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Will gaudy flies adventure in the air,"
6624,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor any lizard sun his spotted skin.

6626,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6627,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,25
6628,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6629,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nothing is joy without thee: I can find
6630,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"No rapture in the first relays of spring,"
6631,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In songs of birds, in young buds opening,"
6632,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nothing inspiriting and nothing kind;
6633,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"For lack of thee, who once wert throned behind"
6634,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"All beauty, like a strength where graces cling,—"
6635,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The jewel and heart of light, which everything"
6636,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Wrestled in rivalry to hold enshrined.
6637,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6638,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ah! since thou’rt fled, and I in each fair sight"
6639,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The sweet occasion of my joy deplore,"
6640,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Where shall I seek thee best, or whom invite"
6641,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Within thy sacred temples and adore?
6642,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Who shall fill thought and truth with old delight,"
6643,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And lead my soul in life as heretofore?

6647,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6648,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The work is done, and from the fingers fall"
6649,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The bloodwarm tools that brought the labour thro’:
6650,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The tasking eye that overrunneth all
6651,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Rests, and affirms there is no more to do."
6652,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Now the third joy of making, the sweet flower"
6653,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of blessed work, bloometh in godlike spirit;"
6654,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Which whoso plucketh holdeth for an hour
6655,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The shrivelling vanity of mortal merit.
6656,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6657,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And thou, my perfect work, thou’rt of to-day;"
6658,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"To-morrow a poor and alien thing wilt be,"
6659,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,True only should the swift life stand at stay:
6660,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Therefore farewell, nor look to bide with me."
6661,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Go find thy friends, if there be one to love thee;"
6662,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Casting thee forth, my child, I rise above thee."

6664,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6665,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,27
6666,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6667,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The fabled seasnake, old Leviathan,"
6668,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Or else what grisly beast of scaly chine
6669,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That champ’d the oceanwrack and swash’d the brine,"
6670,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Before the new and milder days of man,"
6671,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Had never rib nor bray nor swindging fan
6672,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Like his iron swimmer of the Clyde or Tyne,"
6673,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Late-born of golden seed to breed a line
6674,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of offspring swifter and more huge of plan.
6675,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6676,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Straight is her going, for upon the sun"
6677,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"When once she hath look’d, her path and place are plain;"
6678,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,With tireless speed she smiteth one by one
6679,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The shuddering seas and foams along the main;
6680,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And her eased breath, when her wild race is run,"
6681,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Roars thro’ her nostrils like a hurricane.
6682,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6683,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6684,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,28
6685,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6686,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,A thousand times hath in my heart’s behoof
6687,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My tongue been set his passion to impart;
6688,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,A thousand times hath my too coward heart
6689,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My mouth reclosed and fix’d it to the roof;
6690,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Then with such cunning hath it held aloof,"
6691,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,A thousand times kept silence with such art
6692,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That words could do no more: yet on thy part
6693,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Hath silence given a thousand times reproof.
6694,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6695,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I should be bolder, seeing I commend"
6696,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Love, that my dilatory purpose primes,"
6697,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But fear lest with my fears my hope should end:
6698,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Nay I would truth deny and burn my rhymes,"
6699,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Renew my sorrows rather than offend,"
6700,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A thousand times, and yet a thousand times."
6701,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6702,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6703,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,29
6704,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6705,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I travel to thee with the sun’s first rays,"
6706,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That lift the dark west and unwrap the night;
6707,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I dwell beside thee when he walks the height,"
6708,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And fondly toward thee at his setting gaze.
6709,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I wait upon thy coming, but always--"
6710,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Dancing to meet my thoughts if they invite--
6711,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thou hast outrun their longing with delight,"
6712,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And in my solitude dost mock my praise.
6713,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6714,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Now doth my drop of time transcend the whole:
6715,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I see no fame in Khufu’s pyramid,"
6716,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,No history where loveless Nile doth roll.
6717,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"--This is eternal life, which doth forbid"
6718,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Mortal detraction to the exalted soul,"
6719,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And from her inward eye all fate hath hid.
6720,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6721,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6722,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,30
6723,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6724,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My lady pleases me and I please her;
6725,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"This know we both, and I besides know well"
6726,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Wherefore I love her, and I love to tell"
6727,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My love, as all my loving songs aver."
6728,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But what on her part could the passion stir,"
6729,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tho’ ’tis more difficult for love to spell,"
6730,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Yet can I dare divine how this befel,"
6731,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor will her lips deny it if I err.
6732,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6733,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"She loves me first because I love her, then"
6734,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Loves me for knowing why she should be loved,"
6735,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And that I love to praise her, loves again."
6736,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"So from her beauty both our loves are moved,"
6737,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And by her beauty are sustain’d; nor when
6738,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The earth falls from the sun is this disproved.
6739,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6740,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6741,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,31
6742,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6743,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In all things beautiful, I cannot see"
6744,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Her sit or stand, but love is stir’d anew:"
6745,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"’Tis joy to watch the folds fall as they do,"
6746,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And all that comes is past expectancy.
6747,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"If she be silent, silence let it be;"
6748,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,He who would bid her speak might sit and sue
6749,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The deep-brow’d Phidian Jove to be untrue
6750,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To his two thousand years’ solemnity.
6751,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6752,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ah, but her launchèd passion, when she sings."
6753,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Wins on the hearing like a shapen prow
6754,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Borne by the mastery of its urgent wings:
6755,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Or if she deign her wisdom, she doth show"
6756,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"She hath the intelligence of heavenly things,"
6757,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Unsullied by man’s mortal overthrow.
6758,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6759,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6760,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,32
6761,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6762,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Thus to be humbled: ’tis that ranging pride
6763,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,No refuge hath; that in his castle strong
6764,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Brave reason sits beleaguer’d, who so long"
6765,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Kept field, but now must starve where he doth hide;"
6766,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That industry, who once the foe defied,"
6767,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Lies slaughter’d in the trenches; that the throng
6768,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of idle fancies pipe their foolish song,"
6769,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Where late the puissant captains fought and died.
6770,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6771,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Thus to be humbled: ’tis to be undone;
6772,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,A forest fell’d; a city razed to ground;
6773,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A cloak unsewn, unwoven and unspun"
6774,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Till not a thread remains that can be wound.
6775,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And yet, O lover, thee, the ruin’d one,"
6776,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Love who hath humbled thus hath also crown’d.
6777,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6778,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6779,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,33
6780,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6781,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I care not if I live, tho’ life and breath"
6782,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Have never been to me so dear and sweet.
6783,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I care not if I die, for I could meet--"
6784,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Being so happy--happily my death.
6785,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I care not if I love; to-day she saith
6786,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"She loveth, and love’s history is complete."
6787,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor care I if she love me; at her feet
6788,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My spirit bows entranced and worshippeth.
6789,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6790,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I have no care for what was most my care,"
6791,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But all around me see fresh beauty born,"
6792,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And common sights grown lovelier than they were:
6793,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I dream of love, and in the light of morn"
6794,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tremble, beholding all things very fair"
6795,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And strong with strength that puts my strength to scorn.

6799,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6800,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,_O my goddess divine_ sometimes I say:—
6801,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Now let this word for ever and all suffice;
6802,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thou art insatiable, and yet not twice"
6803,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Can even thy lover give his soul away:
6804,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And for my acts, that at thy feet I lay;"
6805,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"For never any other, by device"
6806,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of wisdom, love or beauty, could entice"
6807,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My homage to the measure of this day.
6808,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6809,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I have no more to give thee: lo, I have sold"
6810,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My life, have emptied out my heart, and spent"
6811,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Whate’er I had; till like a beggar, bold"
6812,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"With nought to lose, I laugh and am content."
6813,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A beggar kisses thee; nay love, behold,"
6814,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I fear not: thou too art in beggarment.

6816,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6817,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,35
6818,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6819,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"All earthly beauty hath one cause and proof,"
6820,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To lead the pilgrim soul to beauty above:
6821,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Yet lieth the greater bliss so far aloof,"
6822,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That few there be are wean’d from earthly love.
6823,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Joy’s ladder it is, reaching from home to home,"
6824,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The best of all the work that all was good;
6825,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Whereof ’twas writ the angels aye upclomb,"
6826,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Down sped, and at the top the Lord God stood."
6827,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6828,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But I my time abuse, my eyes by day"
6829,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Center’d on thee, by night my heart on fire--"
6830,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Letting my number’d moments run away--
6831,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor e’en ’twixt night and day to heaven aspire:
6832,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,So true it is that what the eye seeth not
6833,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But slow is loved, and loved is soon forgot."
6834,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6835,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6836,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,36
6837,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6838,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"O my life’s mischief, once my love’s delight,"
6839,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That drew’st a mortgage on my heart’s estate,"
6840,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Whose baneful clause is never out of date,"
6841,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor can avenging time restore my right:
6842,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Whom first to lose sounded that note of spite,"
6843,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Whereto my doleful days were tuned by fate:
6844,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That art the well-loved cause of all my hate,"
6845,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The sun whose wandering makes my hopeless night:
6846,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6847,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thou being in all my lacking all I lack,"
6848,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"It is thy goodness turns my grace to crime,"
6849,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Thy fleetness from my goal which holds me back;
6850,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Wherefore my feet go out of step with time,"
6851,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My very grasp of life is old and slack,"
6852,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And even my passion falters in my rhyme.
6853,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6854,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6855,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,37
6856,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6857,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,At times with hurried hoofs and scattering dust
6858,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I race by field or highway, and my horse"
6859,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Spare not, but urge direct in headlong course"
6860,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Unto some fair far hill that gain I must:
6861,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But near arrived the vision soon mistrust,"
6862,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Rein in, and stand as one who sees the source"
6863,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of strong illusion, shaming thought to force"
6864,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,From off his mind the soil of passion’s gust.
6865,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6866,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My brow I bare then, and with slacken’d speed"
6867,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Can view the country pleasant on all sides,"
6868,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And to kind salutation give good heed:
6869,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I ride as one who for his pleasure rides,"
6870,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And stroke the neck of my delighted steed,"
6871,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And seek what cheer the village inn provides.

6873,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6874,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,38
6875,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6876,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"An idle June day on the sunny Thames,"
6877,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Floating or rowing as our fancy led,"
6878,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Now in the high beams basking as we sped,"
6879,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Now in green shade gliding by mirror’d stems;
6880,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"By lock and weir and isle, and many a spot"
6881,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of memoried pleasure, glad with strength and skill,"
6882,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Friendship, good wine, and mirth, that serve not ill"
6883,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The heavenly Muse, tho’ she requite them not:"
6884,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6885,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I would have life--thou saidst--all as this day,"
6886,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Simple enjoyment calm in its excess,"
6887,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"With not a grief to cloud, and not a ray"
6888,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of passion overhot my peace to oppress;
6889,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"With no ambition to reproach delay,"
6890,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor rapture to disturb its happiness.

6892,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6893,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,39
6894,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6895,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A man that sees by chance his picture, made"
6896,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"As once a child he was, handling some toy,"
6897,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Will gaze to find his spirit within the boy,"
6898,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Yet hath no secret with the soul pourtray’d:
6899,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,He cannot think the simple thought which play’d
6900,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Upon those features then so frank and coy;
6901,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"’Tis his, yet oh! not his: and o’er the joy"
6902,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,His fatherly pity bends in tears dismay’d.
6903,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6904,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Proud of his prime maybe he stand at best,"
6905,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And lightly wear his strength, or aim it high,"
6906,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In knowledge, skill and courage self-possest:—"
6907,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Yet in the pictured face a charm doth lie,"
6908,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The one thing lost more worth than all the rest,"
6909,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Which seeing, he fears to say _This child was I_."
6910,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6911,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6912,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,40
6913,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6914,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tears of love, tears of joy and tears of care,"
6915,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Comforting tears that fell uncomforted,"
6916,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tears o’er the new-born, tears beside the dead,"
6917,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tears of hope, pride and pity, trust and prayer,"
6918,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Tears of contrition; all tears whatsoe’er
6919,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of tenderness or kindness had she shed
6920,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Who here is pictured, ere upon her head"
6921,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The fine gold might be turn’d to silver there.
6922,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6923,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The smile that charm’d the father hath given place
6924,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Unto the furrow’d care wrought by the son;
6925,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But virtue hath transform’d all change to grace:
6926,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"So that I praise the artist, who hath done"
6927,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A portrait, for my worship, of the face"
6928,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Won by the heart my father’s heart that won.
6929,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6930,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6931,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,41
6932,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6933,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,If I could but forget and not recall
6934,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"So well my time of pleasure and of play,"
6935,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"When ancient nature was all new and gay,"
6936,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Light as the fashion that doth last enthrall,—"
6937,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ah mighty nature, when my heart was small,"
6938,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor dream’d what fearful searchings underlay
6939,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The flowers and leafy ecstasy of May,"
6940,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The breathing summer sloth, the scented fall:"
6941,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6942,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Could I forget, then were the fight not hard,"
6943,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Press’d in the melée of accursed things,"
6944,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Having such help in love and such reward:
6945,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But that ’tis I who once--’tis this that stings--
6946,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Once dwelt within the gate that angels guard,"
6947,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Where yet I’d be had I but heavenly wings.

6949,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6950,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,42
6951,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6952,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,When I see childhood on the threshold seize
6953,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The prize of life from age and likelihood,"
6954,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I mourn time’s change that will not be withstood,"
6955,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Thinking how Christ said _Be like one of these_.
6956,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,For in the forest among many trees
6957,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Scarce one in all is found that hath made good
6958,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The virgin pattern of its slender wood,"
6959,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That courtesied in joy to every breeze;
6960,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6961,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But scath’d, but knotted trunks that raise on high"
6962,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Their arms in stiff contortion, strain’d and bare;"
6963,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Whose patriarchal crowns in sorrow sigh.
6964,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"So, little children, ye--nay nay, ye ne’er"
6965,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"From me shall learn how sure the change and nigh,"
6966,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,When ye shall share our strength and mourn to share.

6971,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"When parch’d with thirst, astray on sultry sands"
6972,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The traveller faints, upon his closing ear"
6973,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Steals a fantastic music: he may hear
6974,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The babbling fountain of his native land.
6975,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Before his eyes the vision seems to stand,"
6976,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Where at its terraced brink the maids appear,"
6977,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Who fill their deep urns at its waters clear,"
6978,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And not refuse the help of lover’s hand.
6979,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6980,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"O cruel jest--he cries, as some one flings"
6981,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The sparkling drops in sport or shew of ire--
6982,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"O shameless, O contempt of holy things."
6983,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But never of their wanton play they tire,"
6984,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"As not athirst they sit beside the springs,"
6985,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,While he must quench in death his lost desire.
6986,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6987,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6988,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,44
6989,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6990,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The image of thy love, rising on dark"
6991,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And desperate days over my sullen sea,"
6992,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Wakens again fresh hope and peace in me,"
6993,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Gleaming above upon my groaning bark.
6994,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Whate’er my sorrow be, I then may hark"
6995,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A loving voice: whate’er my terror be,"
6996,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"This heavenly comfort still I win from thee,"
6997,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To shine my lodestar that wert once my mark.
6998,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
6999,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Prodigal nature makes us but to taste
7000,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"One perfect joy, which given she niggard grows;"
7001,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And lest her precious gift should run to waste,"
7002,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Adds to its loss a thousand lesser woes:
7003,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,So to the memory of the gift that graced
7004,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Her hand, her graceless hand more grace bestows."
7005,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7006,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7007,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,45
7008,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7009,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In this neglected, ruin’d edifice"
7010,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of works unperfected and broken schemes,"
7011,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Where is the promise of my early dreams,"
7012,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The smile of beauty and the pearl of price?
7013,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,No charm is left now that could once entice
7014,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Wind-wavering fortune from her golden streams,"
7015,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And full in flight decrepit purpose seems,"
7016,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Trailing the banner of his old device.
7017,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7018,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Within the house a frore and numbing air
7019,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Has chill’d endeavour: sickly memories reign
7020,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In every room, and ghosts are on the stair:"
7021,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And hope behind the dusty window-pane
7022,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Watches the days go by, and bow’d with care"
7023,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Forecasts her last reproach and mortal stain.
7024,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,

7030,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of knowledge speak, and think I knew my mind"
7031,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of heaven and hope, and each word hit its aim."
7032,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Whate’er their sounds be, now all mean the same,"
7033,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Denoting each the fair that none can find;
7034,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Or if I say them, ’tis as one long blind"
7035,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Forgets the sights that he was used to name.
7036,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7037,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Now if men speak of love, ’tis not my love;"
7038,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Nor are their hopes nor joys mine, nor their life"
7039,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of praise the life that I think honour of:
7040,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nay tho’ they turn from house and child and wife
7041,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And self, and in the thought of heaven above"
7042,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Hold, as do I, all mortal things at strife."
7043,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7044,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7045,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,47
7046,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7047,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Since then ’tis only pity looking back,"
7048,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Fear looking forward, and the busy mind"
7049,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Will in one woeful moment more upwind
7050,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Than lifelong years unroll of bitter or black;
7051,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"What is man’s privilege, his hoarding knack"
7052,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of memory with foreboding so combined,"
7053,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Whereby he comes to dream he hath of kind
7054,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The perpetuity which all things lack?
7055,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7056,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Which but to hope is doubtful joy, to have"
7057,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Being a continuance of what, alas,"
7058,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"We mourn, and scarcely bear with to the grave;"
7059,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Or something so unknown that it o’erpass
7060,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The thought of comfort, and the sense that gave"
7061,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Cannot consider it thro’ any glass.

7067,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Not now the child into thine arms, from fright"
7068,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Composed by drowsy tune and shaded light,"
7069,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Whom ignorant of thee thou didst nurse and make;
7070,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Nor now the boy, who scorn’d thee for the sake"
7071,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of growing knowledge or mysterious night,"
7072,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tho’ with fatigue thou didst his limbs invite,"
7073,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And heavily weigh the eyes that would not wake;
7074,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7075,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"No, nor the man severe, who from his best"
7076,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Failing, alert fled to thee, that his breath,"
7077,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Blood, force and fire should come at morn redrest;"
7078,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But me, from whom thy comfort tarrieth,"
7079,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,For all my wakeful prayer sent without rest
7080,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"To thee, O shew and shadow of my death."
7081,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7082,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7083,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,49
7084,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7085,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The spirit’s eager sense for sad or gay
7086,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Filleth with what he will our vessel full:
7087,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Be joy his bent, he waiteth not joy’s day,"
7088,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But like a child at any toy will pull:
7089,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"If sorrow, he will weep for fancy’s sake,"
7090,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And spoil heaven’s plenty with forbidden care.
7091,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,What fortune most denies we slave to take;
7092,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor can fate load us more than we can bear.
7093,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7094,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Since pleasure with the having disappeareth,"
7095,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"He who hath least in hand hath most at heart,"
7096,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,While he keep hope: as he who alway feareth
7097,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,A grief that never comes hath yet the smart;

7103,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7104,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The world comes not to an end: her city-hives
7105,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Swarm with the tokens of a changeless trade,"
7106,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"With rolling wheel, driver and flagging jade,"
7107,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Rich men and beggars, children, priests and wives."
7108,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"New homes on old are set, as lives on lives;"
7109,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Invention with invention overlaid:

7112,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7113,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The men to-day toil as their fathers taught,"
7114,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,With little better’d means; for works depend

7125,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I write you, this one here and that one there,"
7126,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Marking the time and order of your birth?
7127,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"How, with a fancy so unkind to mirth,"
7128,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"A sense so hard, a style so worn and bare,"
7129,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Look ye for any welcome anywhere
7130,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,From any shelf or heart-home on the earth?
7131,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7132,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Should others ask you this, say then I yearn’d"
7133,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"To write you such as once, when I was young,"
7134,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Finding I should have loved and thereto turn’d.
7135,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,’Twere something yet to live again among

7151,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Let the true Muse rewrite her sullied page,"
7152,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And purge her story of the men of hate,"
7153,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That they go dirgeless down to Satan’s rage
7154,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"With all else foul, deform’d and miscreate:"
7155,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,She hath full toil to keep the names of love
7156,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Honour’d on earth, as they are bright above."

7165,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But on those gentle meads, which Lethe charms"

7192,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Think of my sorrow, my despair and ruth,"
7193,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My sheer annihilation if I miss:
7194,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Think--if thou shouldst be false--think of thy truth.

7199,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"These meagre rhymes, which a returning mood"
7200,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Sometimes o’errateth, I as oft despise;"
7201,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And knowing them illnatured, stiff and rude,"
7202,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,See them as others with contemptuous eyes.
7203,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Nay, and I wonder less at God’s respect"
7204,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"For man, a minim jot in time and space,"
7205,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Than at the soaring faith of His elect,"
7206,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"That gift of gifts, the comfort of His grace."

7208,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"O truth unsearchable, O heavenly love,"
7209,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Most infinitely tender, so to touch"
7210,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The work that we can meanly reckon of:
7211,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Surely--I say--we are favour’d overmuch.
7212,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But of this wonder, what doth most amaze"
7213,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Is that we know our love is held for praise.

7218,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Beauty sat with, me all the summer day,"
7219,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Awaiting the sure triumph of her eye;
7220,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Nor mark’d I till we parted, how, hard by,"
7221,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Love in her train stood ready for his prey.
7222,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"She, as too proud to join herself the fray,"
7223,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Trusting too much to her divine ally,"
7224,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"When she saw victory tarry, chid him--‘Why"
7225,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Dost thou not at one stroke this rebel slay?’
7226,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7227,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Then generous Love, who holds my heart in fee,"
7228,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Told of our ancient truce: so from the fight
7229,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"We straight withdrew our forces, all the three."
7230,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Baffled but not dishearten’d she took flight
7231,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Scheming new tactics: Love came home with me,"
7232,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And prompts my measured verses as I write.

7239,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"’Tis sweet to sit entranced, and muse thereon"
7240,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,In melancholy and godlike indolence:
7241,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"When the proud spirit, lull’d by mortal prime"
7242,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"To fond pretence of immortality,"
7243,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Vieweth all moments from the birth of time,"
7244,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,All things whate’er have been or yet shall be.
7245,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7246,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And like the garden, where the year is spent,"
7247,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The ruin of old life is full of yearning,"
7248,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Mingling poetic rapture of lament
7249,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,With flowers and sunshine of spring’s sure returning;
7250,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Only in visions of the white air wan
7251,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,By godlike fancy seized and dwelt upon.

7257,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The spells that conjure back the hour and place,"
7258,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And evermore I look upon thy face,"
7259,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,As in the spring of years long passed away;
7260,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"No fading of thy beauty’s rich array,"
7261,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"No detriment of age on thee I trace,"
7262,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But time’s defeat written in spoils of grace,"
7263,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"From rivals robb’d, whom thou didst pity and slay."
7264,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7265,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"So hath thy growth been, thus thy faith is true,"
7266,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Unchanged in change, still to my growing sense,"
7267,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"To life’s desire the same, and nothing new:"
7268,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But as thou wert in dream and prescience
7269,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"At love’s arising, now thou standst to view"
7270,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,In the broad noon of his magnificence.

7275,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,’Twas on the very day winter took leave
7276,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of those fair fields I love, when to the skies"
7277,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The fragrant Earth was smiling in surprise
7278,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"At that her heaven-descended, quick reprieve,"
7279,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I wander’d forth my sorrow to relieve;
7280,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Yet walk’d amid sweet pleasure in such wise
7281,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"As Adam went alone in Paradise,"
7282,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Before God of His pity fashion’d Eve.
7283,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7284,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And out of tune with all the joy around
7285,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I laid me down beneath a flowering tree,"
7286,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And o’er my senses crept a sleep profound;
7287,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In which it seem’d that thou wert given to me,"
7288,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Rending my body, where with hurried sound"
7289,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I feel my heart beat, when I think of thee."

7295,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My strength, my pride, my grace, my skill untaught,"
7296,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My faith here upon earth, my hope above,"
7297,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My contemplation and perpetual thought:
7298,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The pleasure of my fancy, my heart’s fire,"
7299,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My joy, my peace, my praise, my happy theme,"
7300,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The aim of all my doing, my desire"

7315,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Hath smiled for joy and fled in liberty
7316,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To take his pastime with the peerless throng.
7317,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Oft had I done his noble keeping wrong,"
7318,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Wounding his heart to wonder what might be
7319,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,God’s purpose in a soul of such degree;
7320,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And there he had left me but for mandate strong.
7321,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7322,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"But seeing thee with me now, his task at close"
7323,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"He knoweth, and wherefore he was bid to stay,"
7324,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And work confusion of so many foes:
7325,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The thanks that he doth look for, here I pay,"

7336,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Be they our mighty men, and let me dwell"
7337,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In shadow among the mighty shades of old,"
7338,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,With love’s forsaken palace for my cell;

7341,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And say, These better days, in best things worse,"
7342,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"This bastardy of time’s magnificence,"
7343,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Will mend in fashion and throw off the curse,"
7344,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To crown new love with higher excellence.
7345,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Curs’d tho’ I be to live my life alone,"

7354,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I take my comfort whatsoe’er befall.
7355,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"I abide and abide, as if more stout and tall"
7356,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,My spirit would grow by waiting like a tree;
7357,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And, clear of others’ toil, it pleaseth me"
7358,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,In dreams their quick ambition to forestall.
7359,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7360,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And if thro’ careless eagerness I slide
7361,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"To some accomplishment, I give my voice"
7362,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Still to desire, and in desire abide."
7363,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,I have no stake abroad; if I rejoice
7364,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In what is done or doing, I confide"
7365,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Neither to friend nor foe my secret choice.

7378,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7379,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,What make ye and what strive for? keep ye thought
7380,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of us, or in new excellence divine"
7381,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Is old forgot? or do ye count for nought
7382,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,What the Greek did and what the Florentine?
7383,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,We keep your memories well: O in your store

7389,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Ah heavenly joy! But who hath ever heard,"
7390,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Who hath seen joy, or who shall ever find"
7391,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Joy’s language? There is neither speech nor word;
7392,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nought but itself to teach it to mankind.
7393,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Scarce in our twenty thousand painful days
7394,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,We may touch something: but there lives--beyond
7395,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The best of art, or nature’s kindest phase--"
7396,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The hope whereof our spirit is fain and fond:
7397,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7398,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The cause of beauty given to man’s desires,"
7399,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Writ in the expectancy of starry skies,"
7400,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"The faith which gloweth in our fleeting fires,"
7401,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The aim of all the good that here we prize;

7410,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"When gentle death shall bid it cease to beat,"
7411,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And from all dear illusions disenthrall:
7412,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,However then thou shalt appear to call
7413,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My fearful heart, since down at others’ feet"
7414,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"It bade me kneel so oft, I’ll not retreat"
7415,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"From thee, nor fear before thy feet to fall."
7416,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7417,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And I shall say, ‘Receive this loving heart"
7418,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Which err’d in sorrow only; and in sin
7419,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Took no delight; but being forced apart
7420,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"From thee, without thee hoping thee to win,"
7421,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Most prized what most thou madest as thou art
7422,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"On earth, till heaven were open to enter in.’"

7427,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Dreary was winter, wet with changeful sting"
7428,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Of clinging snowfall and fast-flying frost;
7429,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And bitterer northwinds then withheld the spring,"
7430,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That dallied with her promise till ’twas lost.
7431,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,A sunless and half-hearted summer drown’d
7432,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,The flowers in needful and unwelcom’d rain;
7433,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And Autumn with a sad smile fled uncrown’d
7434,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,From fruitless orchards and unripen’d grain.
7435,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7436,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,But could the skies of this most desolate year
7437,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"In its last month learn with our love to glow,"
7438,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Men yet should rank its cloudless atmosphere
7439,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Above the sunsets of five years ago:
7440,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Of my great praise too part should be its own,"
7441,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Now reckon’d peerless for thy love alone.

7447,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Our commerce ends for aye, thy task is done:"
7448,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Tho’ to win thee I left all else unwon,"
7449,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thou, whom I most have won, art not for me."
7450,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"My first desire, thou too foregone must be,"
7451,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thou too, O much lamented now, tho’ none"
7452,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Will turn to pity thy forsaken son,"
7453,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Nor thy divine sisters will weep for thee.
7454,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7455,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"None will weep for thee: thou return, O Muse,"
7456,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,To thy Sicilian fields: I once have been
7457,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"On thy loved hills, and where thou first didst use"
7458,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Thy sweetly balanced rhyme, O thankless queen,"
7459,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Have pluck’d and wreath’d thy flowers; but do thou choose
7460,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Some happier brow to wear thy garlands green.

7468,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Till its loud praises sound at heaven’s high gate.
7469,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Perfect Thy kingdom in our passing state,"
7470,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,That here on earth Thou mayst as well approve
7471,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"Our service, as Thou ownest theirs above,"
7472,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Whose joy we echo and in pain await.
7473,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,
7474,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Grant body and soul each day their daily bread:
7475,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"And should in spite of grace fresh woe begin,"
7476,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Even as our anger soon is past and dead
7477,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,Be Thy remembrance mortal of our sin:
7478,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,"By Thee in paths of peace Thy sheep be led,"
7479,THE GROWTH OF LOVE,And in the vale of terror comforted.

7488,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,
7489,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,This Poem is in all essentials a faithful translation of Apuleius’
7490,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"story, the chief differences being that first, in the way of form, I"
7491,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"have, for the sake of balance and contrast, chosen to lengthen the"
7492,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"introductory portion; I have also located the story in Crete, and this"
7493,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,gives rise to occasional description.--The description of the sunset
7494,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,on p. 83 is a portrait of the phenomena which followed the great
7495,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"eruption of Krakatoa.--Secondly, in the way of ethic I have made a"
7496,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"gentler characterization of Psyche, who deserves more care in handling"
7497,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,the motives of her conduct than was perhaps felt in Apuleius’ time and
7498,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,country.
7499,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,
7500,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,The acrostic on p. 102 is a remnant of my original dedication. In the
7501,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,first edition there was a note acknowledging the frequent translations
7502,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"from the Greek, and other robberies: and in the second, in which I"
7503,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"altered the spelling, I gave my reasons for that, in so far as it is"
7504,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"unusual. These reasons I need not repeat here, especially as the"
7505,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,spelling is not at all as I should wish to see it. I advocate liberty
7506,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,in these matters instead of the conventional tyranny. But I will add
7507,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,here that the main inconsistencies of the punctuation are owing to this
7508,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,volume being a reprint of three separate books. The stops are intended
7509,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,solely for the readers’ convenience; and almost anything is better
7510,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"than the regulations of a methodic punctuation, which by assuming the"
7511,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,possibility of indicating all the varieties of grammatical structure
7512,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,"and rhythmic pause by four symbols, cannot be applied without perpetual"
7513,NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.,vexation and injury.

7523,NOTE ON THE GROWTH OF LOVE.,"edition of my poems; to which end I have, while this volume was in the"
