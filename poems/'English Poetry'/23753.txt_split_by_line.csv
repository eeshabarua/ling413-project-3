56,JOHN GILPIN.,JOHN GILPIN.
57,JOHN GILPIN.,
58,JOHN GILPIN.,
59,JOHN GILPIN.,John Gilpin was a citizen
60,JOHN GILPIN.,"Of credit and renown,"
61,JOHN GILPIN.,A train-band captain eke was he
62,JOHN GILPIN.,Of famous London town.
63,JOHN GILPIN.,
64,JOHN GILPIN.,"John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,"
65,JOHN GILPIN.,Though wedded we have been
66,JOHN GILPIN.,"These twice ten tedious years, yet we"
67,JOHN GILPIN.,No holiday have seen.
68,JOHN GILPIN.,
69,JOHN GILPIN.,"To-morrow is our wedding-day,"
70,JOHN GILPIN.,And we will then repair
71,JOHN GILPIN.,"Unto the Bell at Edmonton,"
72,JOHN GILPIN.,All in a chaise and pair.
73,JOHN GILPIN.,
74,JOHN GILPIN.,"My sister and my sister's child,"
75,JOHN GILPIN.,"Myself and children three,"
76,JOHN GILPIN.,Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
77,JOHN GILPIN.,On horseback after we.
78,JOHN GILPIN.,
79,JOHN GILPIN.,"He soon replied, I do admire"
80,JOHN GILPIN.,"Of womankind but one,"
81,JOHN GILPIN.,"And you are she, my dearest dear,"
82,JOHN GILPIN.,Therefore it shall be done.
83,JOHN GILPIN.,
84,JOHN GILPIN.,"I am a linendraper bold,"
85,JOHN GILPIN.,"As all the world doth know,"
86,JOHN GILPIN.,And my good friend the calender
87,JOHN GILPIN.,Will lend his horse to go.
88,JOHN GILPIN.,
89,JOHN GILPIN.,"Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, That's well said,"
90,JOHN GILPIN.,"And for that wine is dear,"
91,JOHN GILPIN.,"We will be furnish'd with our own,"
92,JOHN GILPIN.,Which is both bright and clear.
93,JOHN GILPIN.,
94,JOHN GILPIN.,"John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife,"
95,JOHN GILPIN.,"O'erjoy'd was he to find,"
96,JOHN GILPIN.,"That, though on pleasure she was bent,"
97,JOHN GILPIN.,She had a frugal mind.
98,JOHN GILPIN.,
99,JOHN GILPIN.,"The morning came, the chaise was brought"
100,JOHN GILPIN.,But yet was not allow'd
101,JOHN GILPIN.,"To drive up to the door, lest all"
102,JOHN GILPIN.,Should say that she was proud.
103,JOHN GILPIN.,
104,JOHN GILPIN.,"So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,"
105,JOHN GILPIN.,Where they did all get in;
106,JOHN GILPIN.,"Six precious souls, and all agog"
107,JOHN GILPIN.,To dash through thick and thin.
108,JOHN GILPIN.,
109,JOHN GILPIN.,"Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,"
110,JOHN GILPIN.,Were never folks so glad;
111,JOHN GILPIN.,"The stones did rattle underneath,"
112,JOHN GILPIN.,As if Cheapside were mad.
113,JOHN GILPIN.,
114,JOHN GILPIN.,[Illustration]
115,JOHN GILPIN.,
116,JOHN GILPIN.,John Gilpin at his horse's side
117,JOHN GILPIN.,"Seized last the flowing mane,"
118,JOHN GILPIN.,"And up he got in haste to ride,"
119,JOHN GILPIN.,But soon came down again;
120,JOHN GILPIN.,
121,JOHN GILPIN.,"For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,"
122,JOHN GILPIN.,"His journey to begin,"
123,JOHN GILPIN.,"When, turning round his head, he saw"
124,JOHN GILPIN.,Three customers come in.
125,JOHN GILPIN.,
126,JOHN GILPIN.,"So down he came; for loss of time,"
127,JOHN GILPIN.,"Although it grieved him sore,"
128,JOHN GILPIN.,"Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,"
129,JOHN GILPIN.,Would trouble him much more.
130,JOHN GILPIN.,
131,JOHN GILPIN.,'Twas long before the customers
132,JOHN GILPIN.,"Were suited to their mind,"
133,JOHN GILPIN.,"When Betty, screaming, came down stairs,"
134,JOHN GILPIN.,"""The wine is left behind!"""
135,JOHN GILPIN.,
136,JOHN GILPIN.,"Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,"
137,JOHN GILPIN.,"My leathern belt likewise,"
138,JOHN GILPIN.,"In which I bear my trusty sword,"
139,JOHN GILPIN.,When I do exercise.
140,JOHN GILPIN.,
141,JOHN GILPIN.,Now Mrs. Gilpin (careful soul!)
142,JOHN GILPIN.,"Had two stone bottles found,"
143,JOHN GILPIN.,"To hold the liquor that she loved,"
144,JOHN GILPIN.,And keep it safe and sound.
145,JOHN GILPIN.,
146,JOHN GILPIN.,"Each bottle had a curling ear,"
147,JOHN GILPIN.,"Through which the belt he drew,"
148,JOHN GILPIN.,"And hung a bottle on each side,"
149,JOHN GILPIN.,To make his balance true.
150,JOHN GILPIN.,
151,JOHN GILPIN.,"Then, over all, that he might be"
152,JOHN GILPIN.,"Equipp'd from top to toe,"
153,JOHN GILPIN.,"His long red cloak well brush'd and neat,"
154,JOHN GILPIN.,He manfully did throw.
155,JOHN GILPIN.,
156,JOHN GILPIN.,Now see him mounted once again
157,JOHN GILPIN.,"Upon his nimble steed,"
158,JOHN GILPIN.,"Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,"
159,JOHN GILPIN.,With caution and good heed.
160,JOHN GILPIN.,
161,JOHN GILPIN.,But finding soon another road
162,JOHN GILPIN.,"Beneath his well-shod feet,"
163,JOHN GILPIN.,"The snorting boast began to trot,"
164,JOHN GILPIN.,Which gall'd him in his seat.
165,JOHN GILPIN.,
166,JOHN GILPIN.,"So! fair and softly! John he cried,"
167,JOHN GILPIN.,But John he cried in vain;
168,JOHN GILPIN.,"That trot became a gallop soon,"
169,JOHN GILPIN.,In spite of curb and rein.
170,JOHN GILPIN.,
171,JOHN GILPIN.,"So stooping down, as needs he must"
172,JOHN GILPIN.,"Who cannot sit upright,"
173,JOHN GILPIN.,"He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,"
174,JOHN GILPIN.,And eke with all his might.
175,JOHN GILPIN.,
176,JOHN GILPIN.,"His horse, who never in that sort"
177,JOHN GILPIN.,"Had handled been before,"
178,JOHN GILPIN.,What thing upon his back had got
179,JOHN GILPIN.,Did wonder more and more.
180,JOHN GILPIN.,
181,JOHN GILPIN.,"Away went Gilpin, neck or nought!"
182,JOHN GILPIN.,Away went hat and wig;
183,JOHN GILPIN.,"He little dreamt, when he set out,"
184,JOHN GILPIN.,Of running such a rig.
185,JOHN GILPIN.,
186,JOHN GILPIN.,[Illustration]
187,JOHN GILPIN.,
188,JOHN GILPIN.,"The wind did blow, the cloak did fly"
189,JOHN GILPIN.,Like streamer long and gay;
190,JOHN GILPIN.,"Till loop and button failing both,"
191,JOHN GILPIN.,At last it flew away.
192,JOHN GILPIN.,
193,JOHN GILPIN.,Then might all people well discern
194,JOHN GILPIN.,The bottles he had slung;
195,JOHN GILPIN.,"A bottle swinging at each side,"
196,JOHN GILPIN.,As has been said or sung.
197,JOHN GILPIN.,
198,JOHN GILPIN.,"The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,"
199,JOHN GILPIN.,Up flew the windows all;
200,JOHN GILPIN.,"And every soul cried out, Well done!"
201,JOHN GILPIN.,As loud as he could bawl.
202,JOHN GILPIN.,
203,JOHN GILPIN.,Away went Gilpin--who but he?
204,JOHN GILPIN.,His fame soon spread around:
205,JOHN GILPIN.,He carries weight! he rides a race!
206,JOHN GILPIN.,'Tis for a thousand pound!
207,JOHN GILPIN.,
208,JOHN GILPIN.,"And still, as fast as he drew near,"
209,JOHN GILPIN.,"'Twas wonderful to view,"
210,JOHN GILPIN.,How in a trice the turnpike-men
211,JOHN GILPIN.,Their gates wide open threw.
212,JOHN GILPIN.,
213,JOHN GILPIN.,And now as he went bowing down
214,JOHN GILPIN.,"His reeking head full low,"
215,JOHN GILPIN.,The bottles twain behind his back
216,JOHN GILPIN.,Were shattered at a blow.
217,JOHN GILPIN.,
218,JOHN GILPIN.,"Down ran the wine into the road,"
219,JOHN GILPIN.,"Most piteous to be seen,"
220,JOHN GILPIN.,"Which made his horse's flanks to smoke,"
221,JOHN GILPIN.,As they had basted been.
222,JOHN GILPIN.,
223,JOHN GILPIN.,"But still he seem'd to carry weight,"
224,JOHN GILPIN.,With leathern girdle braced:
225,JOHN GILPIN.,For all might see the bottle necks
226,JOHN GILPIN.,Still dangling at his waist.
227,JOHN GILPIN.,
228,JOHN GILPIN.,Thus all through merry Islington
229,JOHN GILPIN.,"These gambols he did play,"
230,JOHN GILPIN.,Until he came unto the Wash
231,JOHN GILPIN.,Of Edmonton so gay;
232,JOHN GILPIN.,
233,JOHN GILPIN.,And there he threw the wash about
234,JOHN GILPIN.,"On both sides of the way,"
235,JOHN GILPIN.,Just like unto a trundling mop
236,JOHN GILPIN.,Or a wild goose at play.
237,JOHN GILPIN.,
238,JOHN GILPIN.,At Edmonton his loving wife
239,JOHN GILPIN.,From the balcony spied
240,JOHN GILPIN.,"Her tender husband, wondering much"
241,JOHN GILPIN.,To see how he did ride.
242,JOHN GILPIN.,
243,JOHN GILPIN.,"Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house--"
244,JOHN GILPIN.,They all at once did cry;
245,JOHN GILPIN.,"The dinner waits, and we are tired:"
246,JOHN GILPIN.,Said Gilpin--So am I!
247,JOHN GILPIN.,
248,JOHN GILPIN.,But yet his horse was not a whit
249,JOHN GILPIN.,Inclined to tarry there;
250,JOHN GILPIN.,For why?--his owner had a house
251,JOHN GILPIN.,"Full ten miles off, at Ware."
252,JOHN GILPIN.,
253,JOHN GILPIN.,"So like an arrow swift he flew,"
254,JOHN GILPIN.,Shot by an archer strong;
255,JOHN GILPIN.,So did he fly--which brings me to
256,JOHN GILPIN.,The middle of my song.
257,JOHN GILPIN.,
258,JOHN GILPIN.,[Illustration]
259,JOHN GILPIN.,
260,JOHN GILPIN.,"Away went Gilpin out of breath,"
261,JOHN GILPIN.,"And sore against his will,"
262,JOHN GILPIN.,Till at his friend the calender's
263,JOHN GILPIN.,His horse at last stood still.
264,JOHN GILPIN.,
265,JOHN GILPIN.,"The calender, amazed to see"
266,JOHN GILPIN.,"His neighbour in such trim,"
267,JOHN GILPIN.,"Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,"
268,JOHN GILPIN.,And thus accosted him:
269,JOHN GILPIN.,
270,JOHN GILPIN.,What news? what news? your tidings tell;
271,JOHN GILPIN.,Tell me you must and shall--
272,JOHN GILPIN.,"Say why bareheaded you are come,"
273,JOHN GILPIN.,Or why you come at all?
274,JOHN GILPIN.,
275,JOHN GILPIN.,"Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,"
276,JOHN GILPIN.,And loved a timely joke;
277,JOHN GILPIN.,And thus unto the calender
278,JOHN GILPIN.,In merry guise he spoke:
279,JOHN GILPIN.,
280,JOHN GILPIN.,I came because your horse would come;
281,JOHN GILPIN.,"And, if I well forebode,"
282,JOHN GILPIN.,"My hat and wig will soon be here,"
283,JOHN GILPIN.,They are upon the road.
284,JOHN GILPIN.,
285,JOHN GILPIN.,"The calender, right glad to find"
286,JOHN GILPIN.,"His friend in merry pin,"
287,JOHN GILPIN.,"Return'd him not a single word,"
288,JOHN GILPIN.,But to the house went in;
289,JOHN GILPIN.,
290,JOHN GILPIN.,"Thence straight he came with hat and wig,"
291,JOHN GILPIN.,"A wig that flow'd behind,"
292,JOHN GILPIN.,"A hat not much the worse for wear,"
293,JOHN GILPIN.,Each comely in its kind.
294,JOHN GILPIN.,
295,JOHN GILPIN.,"He held them up, and in his turn"
296,JOHN GILPIN.,Thus show'd his ready wit:
297,JOHN GILPIN.,"My head is twice as big as yours,"
298,JOHN GILPIN.,They therefore needs must fit.
299,JOHN GILPIN.,
300,JOHN GILPIN.,But let me scrape the dirt away
301,JOHN GILPIN.,That hangs upon your face;
302,JOHN GILPIN.,"And stop and eat, for well you may"
303,JOHN GILPIN.,Be in a hungry case.
304,JOHN GILPIN.,
305,JOHN GILPIN.,"Said John--It is my wedding-day,"
306,JOHN GILPIN.,"And all the world would stare,"
307,JOHN GILPIN.,"If wife should dine at Edmonton,"
308,JOHN GILPIN.,And I should dine at Ware.
309,JOHN GILPIN.,
310,JOHN GILPIN.,"So turning to his horse, he said,"
311,JOHN GILPIN.,I am in haste to dine;
312,JOHN GILPIN.,"'Twas for your pleasure you came here,"
313,JOHN GILPIN.,You shall go back for mine.
314,JOHN GILPIN.,
315,JOHN GILPIN.,"Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!"
316,JOHN GILPIN.,For which he paid full dear;
317,JOHN GILPIN.,"For while he spake, a braying ass"
318,JOHN GILPIN.,Did sing most loud and clear.
319,JOHN GILPIN.,
320,JOHN GILPIN.,"Whereat his horse did snort, as he"
321,JOHN GILPIN.,"Had heard a lion roar,"
322,JOHN GILPIN.,And gallop'd off with all his might
323,JOHN GILPIN.,As he had done before.
324,JOHN GILPIN.,
325,JOHN GILPIN.,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
326,JOHN GILPIN.,Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
327,JOHN GILPIN.,He lost them sooner than at first;
328,JOHN GILPIN.,For why?--they were too big.
329,JOHN GILPIN.,
330,JOHN GILPIN.,[Illustration]
331,JOHN GILPIN.,
332,JOHN GILPIN.,"Now Mrs. Gilpin, when she saw"
333,JOHN GILPIN.,Her husband posting down
334,JOHN GILPIN.,"Into the country far away,"
335,JOHN GILPIN.,She pull'd out half-a-crown;
336,JOHN GILPIN.,
337,JOHN GILPIN.,"And thus unto the youth she said,"
338,JOHN GILPIN.,"That drove them to the Bell,"
339,JOHN GILPIN.,This shall be yours when you bring back
340,JOHN GILPIN.,My husband safe and well.
341,JOHN GILPIN.,
342,JOHN GILPIN.,"The youth did ride, and soon did meet"
343,JOHN GILPIN.,John coming back amain;
344,JOHN GILPIN.,"Whom in a trice he tried to stop,"
345,JOHN GILPIN.,By catching at his rein;
346,JOHN GILPIN.,
347,JOHN GILPIN.,"But not performing what he meant,"
348,JOHN GILPIN.,"And gladly would have done,"
349,JOHN GILPIN.,"The frighted steed he frighted more,"
350,JOHN GILPIN.,And made him faster run.
351,JOHN GILPIN.,
352,JOHN GILPIN.,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
353,JOHN GILPIN.,Went post-boy at his heels.
354,JOHN GILPIN.,The post-boy's horse right glad to miss
355,JOHN GILPIN.,The lumbering of the wheels.
356,JOHN GILPIN.,
357,JOHN GILPIN.,"Six gentlemen upon the road,"
358,JOHN GILPIN.,"Thus seeing Gilpin fly,"
359,JOHN GILPIN.,"With post-boy scampering in the rear,"
360,JOHN GILPIN.,They raised the hue and cry:--
361,JOHN GILPIN.,
362,JOHN GILPIN.,Stop thief! stop thief!--a highwayman!
363,JOHN GILPIN.,Not one of them was mute;
364,JOHN GILPIN.,And all and each that pass'd that way
365,JOHN GILPIN.,Did join in the pursuit.
366,JOHN GILPIN.,
367,JOHN GILPIN.,And now the turnpike gates again
368,JOHN GILPIN.,Flew open in short space;
369,JOHN GILPIN.,"The toll-men thinking, as before,"
370,JOHN GILPIN.,That Gilpin rode a race.
371,JOHN GILPIN.,
372,JOHN GILPIN.,"And so he did, and won it too,"
373,JOHN GILPIN.,For he got first to town;
374,JOHN GILPIN.,Nor stopp'd till where he had got up
375,JOHN GILPIN.,He did again get down.
376,JOHN GILPIN.,
377,JOHN GILPIN.,"Now let us sing, long live the king!"
378,JOHN GILPIN.,"And Gilpin, long live he;"
379,JOHN GILPIN.,"And when he next doth ride abroad,"
380,JOHN GILPIN.,May I be there to see!
