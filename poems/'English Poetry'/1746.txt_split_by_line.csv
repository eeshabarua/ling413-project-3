34,PREFACE,THIS poor little flutter of rhymes would not have been let down the wind:
35,PREFACE,the project would have been abandoned but for the too flattering
36,PREFACE,encouragement of a responsible friend.  I trust that he may not “live to
37,PREFACE,"rue the day,” like Keith of Craigentolly in the ballad."
38,PREFACE,
39,PREFACE,The “Loyal Lyrics” on Charles and James and the White Rose must not be
40,PREFACE,understood as implying a rebellious desire for the subversion of the
41,PREFACE,present illustrious dynasty.
42,PREFACE,
43,PREFACE,"“These are but symbols that I sing,"
44,PREFACE,"These names of Prince, and rose, and King;"
45,PREFACE,"Types of things dear that do not die,"
46,PREFACE,But reign in loyal memory.
47,PREFACE,_Across the water_ surely they
48,PREFACE,Abide their twenty-ninth of May;
49,PREFACE,"And we shall hail their happy reign,"
50,PREFACE,"When Life comes to his own again,”—"
51,PREFACE,
52,PREFACE,over the water that divides us from the voices and faces of our desires
53,PREFACE,and dreams.
54,PREFACE,
55,PREFACE,"Of the ballads, _The Young Ruthven_ and _The Queen of Spain_ were written"
56,PREFACE,in competition with the street minstrels of the close of the sixteenth
57,PREFACE,century.  The legend on which _The Young Ruthven_ is based is well known;
58,PREFACE,"_The Queen of Spain_ is the story of the _Florencia_, a ship of the"
59,PREFACE,"Spanish Armada, wrecked in Tobermory Bay, as it was told to me by a"
60,PREFACE,mariner in the Sound of Mull.  In _Keith of Craigentolly_ the family and
61,PREFACE,"territorial names of the hero or villain are purposely altered, so as to"
62,PREFACE,avoid injuring susceptibilities and arousing unavailing regrets.
