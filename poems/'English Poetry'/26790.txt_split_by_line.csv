29,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
30,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
31,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"I stood before my master’s board,"
32,THE BROTHER AVENGED,The skinker’s office plying;
33,THE BROTHER AVENGED,The herald-men brought tidings then
34,THE BROTHER AVENGED,That my brother was murdered lying.
35,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
36,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"I followed my lord unto his bed,"
37,THE BROTHER AVENGED,By his dearest down he laid him;
38,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Then my courser out of the stall I led,"
39,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And with saddle and bit arrayed him.
40,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
41,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"I sprang upon my courser’s back,"
42,THE BROTHER AVENGED,With the spur began to goad him;
43,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"And ere I drew his bridle to,"
44,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Full fifteen leagues I rode him.
45,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
46,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And when I came to the noisy hall
47,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Where the Kemps carouse were keeping,"
48,THE BROTHER AVENGED,O then I saw my mother dear
49,THE BROTHER AVENGED,O’er the corse of my brother weeping.
50,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
51,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Then I laid an arrow on my good bow,"
52,THE BROTHER AVENGED,The bow that never deceived me;
53,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"And straight I shot the King’s Kempions twelve,"
54,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Of my brother who had bereaved me.
55,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
56,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"And then to the Ting I rode away,"
57,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Where the judges twelve were seated;
58,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Of six to avenge my brother I begged,"
59,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And of six protection entreated.
60,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
61,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"For the third time rode I to the Ting,"
62,THE BROTHER AVENGED,For deep revenge I lusted;
63,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Up stood the liege-man of the King,"
64,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And at me fiercely thrusted.
65,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
66,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Up stood the liege-man of the King,"
67,THE BROTHER AVENGED,With a furious thrust toward me;
68,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"And the Judges twelve rose in the Ting,"
69,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And an outlaw’d man declared me.
70,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
71,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Then I laid an arrow on my good bow,"
72,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And the bow to its utmost bent I;
73,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And into the heart of the King’s liege-man
74,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"The sharp, sharp arrow sent I."
75,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
76,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Then away from the Ting amain I sped,"
77,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And my good steed clomb in hurry;
78,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"There was nothing for me but to hasten and flee,"
79,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And myself ’mong the woods to bury.
80,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
81,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And hidden for eight long years I lay
82,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Amid the woods so lonely;
83,THE BROTHER AVENGED,I’d nothing to eat in that dark retreat
84,THE BROTHER AVENGED,But grass and green leaves only.
85,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
86,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"I’d nothing to eat in that dark retreat,"
87,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Save the grass and leaves I devoured;
88,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"No bed-fellows crept to the place where I slept,"
89,THE BROTHER AVENGED,But bears that brooned and roared.
90,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
91,THE BROTHER AVENGED,So near at hand was the holy tide
92,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Of our Lady of mercies tender;
93,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"The King of the Swedes his followers leads,"
94,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And rides to the Church in splendour.
95,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
96,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"So I laid an arrow on my good bow,"
97,THE BROTHER AVENGED,As I looked from the gap so narrow;
98,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And into the heart of the Swedish King
99,THE BROTHER AVENGED,I sent the yard-long arrow.
100,THE BROTHER AVENGED,
101,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"Now lies on the ground the Swedish King,"
102,THE BROTHER AVENGED,And the blood from his death-wound showers;
103,THE BROTHER AVENGED,"So blythe is my breast, though still I must rest"
104,THE BROTHER AVENGED,Amid the forest bowers.

109,THE EYES,THE EYES
110,THE EYES,
111,THE EYES,
112,THE EYES,To kiss a pair of red lips small
113,THE EYES,Full many a lover sighs;

115,THE EYES,Let it be Sophy’s eyes.
116,THE EYES,"The eyes, the eyes, whose witcheries"
117,THE EYES,Have filled my heart with care;
118,THE EYES,"Too dear I prize the eyes, the eyes"
119,THE EYES,Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.
120,THE EYES,
121,THE EYES,"Were I the Czar, my kingly crown,"
122,THE EYES,"My troops and victories,"
123,THE EYES,And fair renown I’d all lay down
124,THE EYES,To kiss but Sophy’s eyes.
125,THE EYES,"The charming eyes, whose witcheries"
126,THE EYES,Have filled my heart with care;
127,THE EYES,Too dear I prize the charming eyes
128,THE EYES,Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.
129,THE EYES,
130,THE EYES,"Perhaps I’ve seen a fairer face,"
131,THE EYES,Though hers may well surprise;
132,THE EYES,"A form perhaps of lovelier grace,"
133,THE EYES,"But, oh! the eyes, the eyes!"
134,THE EYES,"The matchless eyes, whose witcheries"
135,THE EYES,Have filled my heart with care;
136,THE EYES,I well may prize the matchless eyes
137,THE EYES,Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.
138,THE EYES,
139,THE EYES,What with the polished diamond-stone
140,THE EYES,Can vie beneath the skies?
141,THE EYES,"Oh, it is vied and far outshone"
142,THE EYES,By Sophy’s beaming eyes.
143,THE EYES,"By Sophy’s eyes, whose witcheries"
144,THE EYES,Have filled my heart with care;
145,THE EYES,Well may I prize the beaming eyes
146,THE EYES,Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.
147,THE EYES,
148,THE EYES,"The sun of June burns furiously,"
149,THE EYES,And brooks and meadows dries;
150,THE EYES,"But, oh, with more intensity"
151,THE EYES,Burn cruel Sophy’s eyes!
152,THE EYES,"The wicked eyes, whose witcheries"
153,THE EYES,Have filled my heart with care;
154,THE EYES,Too dear I prize the wicked eyes
155,THE EYES,Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.
156,THE EYES,
157,THE EYES,"O, soon beneath their piercing ray,"
158,THE EYES,"Like some parched plant which dies,"
159,THE EYES,"Wither shall I, poor youth, away?"
160,THE EYES,And all for Sophy’s eyes.
161,THE EYES,"But bless the eyes, whose witcheries"
162,THE EYES,Have filled my heart with care;
163,THE EYES,Till Death I’ll prize and bless the eyes
164,THE EYES,Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.

171,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,
172,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,
173,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"With the leaves of the myrtle I’ll cover my brand,"
174,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,Like Harmodius and Aristogiton of yore;
175,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"When the tyrant they slew, and their dear native land"
176,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,They caused with just laws to be governed once more.
177,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,
178,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"O, beloved Harmodius! thou still art not dead,"
179,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"In the Isles of the Blest thou still livest, they say;"
180,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,Where the swift-heel’d Achilles and bold Diomed
181,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,Through sweet flowery meadows continually stray.
182,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,
183,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"With the leaves of the myrtle I’ll cover my blade,"
184,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,Like Harmodius and Aristogiton of yore;
185,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"Who, whilst the high rites to Athena were paid,"
186,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,The bold tyrant Hipparchus extended in gore.
187,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,
188,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"And on earth ever, ever your glory shall glow,"
189,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"Harmodius and Aristogiton, sun-bright;"
190,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,"Because ye the damnable tyrant laid low,"
191,HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON,And restored to your country her law and her right.

326,THE ELF BRIDE {21},
327,THE ELF BRIDE {21},There was a youthful swain one day
328,THE ELF BRIDE {21},Did ted the new mown grass;
329,THE ELF BRIDE {21},There came a gay and lovely may
330,THE ELF BRIDE {21},From out the nigh morass.
331,THE ELF BRIDE {21},"Clad in a dress of silk was she,"
332,THE ELF BRIDE {21},"Green as the leaves which deck the tree,"
333,THE ELF BRIDE {21},Her head so winsomely to see
334,THE ELF BRIDE {21},With bulrush plaited was.
335,THE ELF BRIDE {21},
336,THE ELF BRIDE {21},"That lass he wooed, his suit she heeds,"
337,THE ELF BRIDE {21},And married are the pair;
338,THE ELF BRIDE {21},To bridal bed his wife he leads—
339,THE ELF BRIDE {21},But what befell him there?
340,THE ELF BRIDE {21},"He found, fear-stricken and amaz’d,"
341,THE ELF BRIDE {21},"That he a rough oak trunk embrac’d,"
342,THE ELF BRIDE {21},Instead of the enchanting waist
343,THE ELF BRIDE {21},Of his mysterious fair.
344,THE ELF BRIDE {21},
345,THE ELF BRIDE {21},"Then straight abroad a voice he heard,"
346,THE ELF BRIDE {21},Which sang the window through;
347,THE ELF BRIDE {21},These were the words the voice proffer’d
348,THE ELF BRIDE {21},If my report be true:
349,THE ELF BRIDE {21},“Come out to her whom thou didst wed!
350,THE ELF BRIDE {21},Upon my mead thy couch is spread.”
351,THE ELF BRIDE {21},From this he guessed with some elf maid
352,THE ELF BRIDE {21},That he had had to do.

360,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"O, would that with last and shoe I had stay’d,"
361,THE TREASURE DIGGER,Without wild desires;
362,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"And, ah! no trust in Satan had laid,"
363,THE TREASURE DIGGER,That prince of liars!
364,THE TREASURE DIGGER,
365,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"Each Saturday night, when slept the rest,"
366,THE TREASURE DIGGER,Away I stroll’d
367,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"To the forest, so murky and drear, in quest"
368,THE TREASURE DIGGER,Of buried gold.
369,THE TREASURE DIGGER,
370,THE TREASURE DIGGER,And then I beheld the hopping fire glow
371,THE TREASURE DIGGER,The briar behind;
372,THE TREASURE DIGGER,And down to the earth my wishing-rod low
373,THE TREASURE DIGGER,Itself declin’d.
374,THE TREASURE DIGGER,
375,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"I dug then, and gripped the chest’s ring amain,"
376,THE TREASURE DIGGER,And held it stout;
377,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"But the copper deceitful burst in twain,"
378,THE TREASURE DIGGER,And the fiends laughed out.
379,THE TREASURE DIGGER,
380,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"Just, just as long was the treasure my own,"
381,THE TREASURE DIGGER,As I trembled with fright;
382,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"But soon as I held it secure, down, down"
383,THE TREASURE DIGGER,It sank from sight.
384,THE TREASURE DIGGER,
385,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"Ye devilish pack, what grin ye at?"
386,THE TREASURE DIGGER,I fell not your prey;
387,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"I’ll trust no more in old women’s chat,"
388,THE TREASURE DIGGER,And in cross-shaped way.

390,THE TREASURE DIGGER,"I go by my last and shoe to stay,"

401,THE FISHER,"The fisherman saddleth his good winged horse,"
402,THE FISHER,To be on the deep seems to him his best course.
403,THE FISHER,
404,THE FISHER,"Against the white strand loud and hoarse the wave breaks,"
405,THE FISHER,And towards the strand now the fisherman makes.
406,THE FISHER,
407,THE FISHER,"And up when the fisher his fishing-line drew,"
408,THE FISHER,A fine golden fish on the hook met his view.
409,THE FISHER,
410,THE FISHER,"Then he laughed in his beard: “I’ve of fish seen a store,"
411,THE FISHER,But ne’er one with golden cloth kirtle before.
412,THE FISHER,
413,THE FISHER,"“If I a gold piece for each gold-scale possess’d,"
414,THE FISHER,With poverty I should no more be distrest.”
415,THE FISHER,
416,THE FISHER,"With its tail the fish ’gan the bench furious to smite,"
417,THE FISHER,And a strange dance it seemed to the fisherman’s sight.
418,THE FISHER,
419,THE FISHER,"“Thou wealthy man, be not, I pray thee, so gay,"
420,THE FISHER,A much quieter part a poor fisher should play.”
421,THE FISHER,
422,THE FISHER,"The golden fish heard every word as it lay,"
423,THE FISHER,Began straight to talk and discourse in this way:—
424,THE FISHER,
425,THE FISHER,"“I’m full as rich, fisherman, as thou art poor,"
426,THE FISHER,And soon for thee happiness I will procure.
427,THE FISHER,
428,THE FISHER,"“Straight cast me again in the ocean my home,"
429,THE FISHER,"And a well-doing man thou, I swear, shalt become."
430,THE FISHER,
431,THE FISHER,"“The Queen of the ocean my mother is, know,"
432,THE FISHER,She linen and bolsters on thee shall bestow.
433,THE FISHER,
434,THE FISHER,"“My father is King in the depths of the sea,"
435,THE FISHER,And healthy and strong he shall cause thee to be.
436,THE FISHER,
437,THE FISHER,"“My lover he sorrows for me in the brine,"
438,THE FISHER,My golden cloth kirtle shall also be thine.”
439,THE FISHER,
440,THE FISHER,"“For the sovereign of fishes I care not a straw,"
441,THE FISHER,"On myself, if I did, I but laughter should draw."
442,THE FISHER,
443,THE FISHER,"“For thy mother’s fine cushions I care little more,"
444,THE FISHER,My own Queen could make better ware any hour.
445,THE FISHER,
446,THE FISHER,"“But if thou to a wooer thy troth didst allot,"
447,THE FISHER,The repose of two lovers destroy I will not.”
448,THE FISHER,
449,THE FISHER,The trembling gold fish in the water placed he:
450,THE FISHER,“From such wretched captures the Lord preserve me!
451,THE FISHER,
452,THE FISHER,"“If to-morrow a like one upon my hook bite,"
453,THE FISHER,"I shall perish of hunger, poor miserable wight.”"
454,THE FISHER,
455,THE FISHER,He the rest of the day sat at home by his hearth
456,THE FISHER,And spake not a word that repeating is worth.
457,THE FISHER,
458,THE FISHER,"He early next morn in his boat his seat took,"
459,THE FISHER,And straightway adjusted a bait to his hook.
460,THE FISHER,
461,THE FISHER,"And soon as he’d overboard cast the fish-line,"
462,THE FISHER,The float it descended deep under the brine.
463,THE FISHER,
464,THE FISHER,"Then he laughed in his beard, and with bitterness said:"
465,THE FISHER,“A catch of another gold fish I have made!”
466,THE FISHER,
467,THE FISHER,"The thin lengthy line he up-drew half unwilling,"
468,THE FISHER,"And, behold! there upon the hook hung a gold shilling."
469,THE FISHER,
470,THE FISHER,"And I can forsooth and for certainty say,"
471,THE FISHER,That he for delight had no rest the whole day.
472,THE FISHER,
473,THE FISHER,"But as oft as the line he up-drew from the tide,"
474,THE FISHER,Upon the hook never a fish he descried.
475,THE FISHER,
476,THE FISHER,"For whene’er for the fish he upon the hook sought,"
477,THE FISHER,He found that a shilling of gold he had caught.

483,THE CUCKOO,
484,THE CUCKOO,
485,THE CUCKOO,"Abiding an appointment made,"
486,THE CUCKOO,"Upon the weed-grown steep I stayed,"
487,THE CUCKOO,"One morning mild when May was new,"
488,THE CUCKOO,And fresh the down was fraught with dew.
489,THE CUCKOO,"The meads were flowering, bright the woods,"
490,THE CUCKOO,The branches yielding thousand buds.
491,THE CUCKOO,My lips employed in song the while
492,THE CUCKOO,On Morfydd of the merry smile.
493,THE CUCKOO,’Twas then as round I cast my eye
494,THE CUCKOO,With mighty wish the maid to spy;
495,THE CUCKOO,"Though, howsoe’er my sight I strained,"
496,THE CUCKOO,No glimpse of Morfydd I obtained.
497,THE CUCKOO,"I heard the cuckoo’s voice arise,"
498,THE CUCKOO,Singing the song which most I prize.
499,THE CUCKOO,To each Bard true most sweet I trow
500,THE CUCKOO,His music on the mountain’s brow.
501,THE CUCKOO,"Therefore, as called by courtesy,"
502,THE CUCKOO,I greeted him in poesy.
503,THE CUCKOO,
504,THE CUCKOO,"“Good day, dear Cuckoo, with thy strain"
505,THE CUCKOO,A herald thou from heaven’s domain;
506,THE CUCKOO,To us the tidings thou dost bear
507,THE CUCKOO,"Of summer, blissful season fair."
508,THE CUCKOO,Of summer which to greenwood shade
509,THE CUCKOO,Entices forth the Bard and maid;
510,THE CUCKOO,"Which decks with foliage dense the grove,"
511,THE CUCKOO,And through all nature breathes of love.
512,THE CUCKOO,"O, dear to me that note of thine,"
513,THE CUCKOO,It seasons love like choicest wine;
514,THE CUCKOO,"Whilst, doating fondness to chastise,"
515,THE CUCKOO,What cutting taunt in ‘Cuckoo’ lies!
516,THE CUCKOO,"But, pretty bird, I pray declare"
517,THE CUCKOO,Where lingereth now my lady fair?”
518,THE CUCKOO,
519,THE CUCKOO,"“O, poet, what delusion great"
520,THE CUCKOO,Doth fill this year thy foolish pate?
521,THE CUCKOO,’Tis harbouring a useless pain
522,THE CUCKOO,One thought of her to entertain.
523,THE CUCKOO,"With all her store of winning charms,"
524,THE CUCKOO,She weds her to another’s arms.
525,THE CUCKOO,"Believe me, when I say to thee"
526,THE CUCKOO,A mate of thine she may not be.”
527,THE CUCKOO,
528,THE CUCKOO,"“Hush, hush, I’ll not believe thy voice,"
529,THE CUCKOO,Dare not defame my bosom’s choice.
530,THE CUCKOO,"That nymph, the fairest ’neath the sun,"
531,THE CUCKOO,"Has sworn an oath, a solemn one;"
532,THE CUCKOO,"She vowed by her baptismal rite,"
533,THE CUCKOO,"Beneath the bough one blessed night,"
534,THE CUCKOO,"Her hand my own enclasping hard,"
535,THE CUCKOO,"To live and die with me, her Bard."
536,THE CUCKOO,The minister that mystic night
537,THE CUCKOO,"Was Madog Benfras, matchless wight."
538,THE CUCKOO,"Her suitors all may vainly sigh,"
539,THE CUCKOO,"How should she wed, whom wed have I?"
540,THE CUCKOO,"’Tis false, O Bird, what thou dost state,"
541,THE CUCKOO,And waste of time with thee to prate.
542,THE CUCKOO,"Folly and drunkenness, ’tis plain,"
543,THE CUCKOO,Have got possession of thy brain.
544,THE CUCKOO,"Hence with thy news, and get thee cool,"
545,THE CUCKOO,"Thou art, I fear, a very fool!”"
546,THE CUCKOO,
547,THE CUCKOO,"“O, Dafydd, who the fool but thou,"
548,THE CUCKOO,Talking this guise beneath the bough?
549,THE CUCKOO,"Another husband chooses she,"
550,THE CUCKOO,Whose charms deceitful captured thee.
551,THE CUCKOO,The Damsel of the neck of snow
552,THE CUCKOO,"Is now another’s wife, I trow."
553,THE CUCKOO,"To love another’s looks not well,"
554,THE CUCKOO,The Bow Bach owns the blooming belle.”
555,THE CUCKOO,
556,THE CUCKOO,"“For what thou’st sung within the grove,"
557,THE CUCKOO,"With malice filled, about my love,"
558,THE CUCKOO,"May days of winter come with speed,"
559,THE CUCKOO,The summer and the sun recede;
560,THE CUCKOO,"Hoar frost upon the foliage fall,"
561,THE CUCKOO,The wood and branches withering all.
562,THE CUCKOO,"And thou with piercing cold be slain,"
563,THE CUCKOO,Thou horrid bird of hateful strain!”
