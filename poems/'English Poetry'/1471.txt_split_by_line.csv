105,TO COVENTRY PATMORE,"LO, my book thinks to look Time’s leaguer down,"
106,TO COVENTRY PATMORE,Under the banner of your spread renown!
107,TO COVENTRY PATMORE,Or if these levies of impuissant rhyme

110,TO COVENTRY PATMORE,Armed with your crested and prevailing Name.

135,I,I
136,I,
137,I,SECRET was the garden;
138,I,Set i’ the pathless awe
139,I,Where no star its breath can draw.
140,I,"Life, that is its warden,"
141,I,"Sits behind the fosse of death.  Mine eyes saw not, and I saw."
142,I,
143,II,II
144,II,
145,II,It was a mazeful wonder;
146,II,Thrice three times it was enwalled
147,II,With an emerald—
148,II,Sealèd so asunder.
149,II,"All its birds in middle air hung a-dream, their music thralled."
150,II,
151,III,III
152,III,
153,III,"The Lady of fair weeping,"
154,III,"At the garden’s core,"
155,III,Sang a song of sweet and sore
156,III,And the after-sleeping;
157,III,"In the land of Luthany, and the tracts of Elenore."
158,III,
159,IV,IV
160,IV,
161,IV,"With sweet-panged singing,"
162,IV,Sang she through a dream-night’s day;
163,IV,"That the bowers might stay,"
164,IV,"Birds bate their winging,"
165,IV,Nor the wall of emerald float in wreathèd haze away.
166,IV,
167,V,V
168,V,
169,V,"The lily kept its gleaming,"
170,V,In her tears (divine conservers!)
171,V,Washèd with sad art;
172,V,And the flowers of dreaming
173,V,"Palèd not their fervours,"
174,V,For her blood flowed through their nervures;
175,V,"And the roses were most red, for she dipt them in her heart."
176,V,
177,VI,VI
178,VI,
179,VI,"There was never moon,"
180,VI,Save the white sufficing woman:
181,VI,Light most heavenly-human—
182,VI,"Like the unseen form of sound,"
183,VI,"Sensed invisibly in tune,—"
184,VI,With a sun-derivèd stole
185,VI,Did inaureole
186,VI,All her lovely body round;
187,VI,Lovelily her lucid body with that light was interstrewn.
188,VI,
189,VII,VII
190,VII,
191,VII,"The sun which lit that garden wholly,"
192,VII,"Low and vibrant visible,"
193,VII,Tempered glory woke;
194,VII,And it seemèd solely
195,VII,Like a silver thurible
196,VII,"Solemnly swung, slowly,"
197,VII,"Fuming clouds of golden fire, for a cloud of incense-smoke."
198,VII,
199,VIII,VIII
200,VIII,
201,VIII,"But woe’s me, and woe’s me,"
202,VIII,For the secrets of her eyes!
203,VIII,In my visions fearfully
204,VIII,They are ever shown to be
205,VIII,"As fringèd pools, whereof each lies"
206,VIII,Pallid-dark beneath the skies
207,VIII,Of a night that is
208,VIII,But one blear necropolis.
209,VIII,"And her eyes a little tremble, in the wind of her own sighs."
210,VIII,
211,IX,IX
212,IX,
213,IX,Many changes rise on
214,IX,Their phantasmal mysteries.
215,IX,They grow to an horizon
216,IX,Where earth and heaven meet;
217,IX,And like a wing that dies on
218,IX,"The vague twilight-verges,"
219,IX,Many a sinking dream doth fleet
220,IX,Lessening down their secrecies.
221,IX,"And, as dusk with day converges,"
222,IX,Their orbs are troublously
223,IX,Over-gloomed and over-glowed with hope and fear of things to be.
224,IX,
225,X,X
226,X,
227,X,"There is a peak on Himalay,"
228,X,"And on the peak undeluged snow,"
229,X,And on the snow not eagles stray;
230,X,"There if your strong feet could go,—"
231,X,Looking over tow’rd Cathay
232,X,From the never-deluged snow—
233,X,Farthest ken might not survey
234,X,Where the peoples underground dwell whom antique fables know.
235,X,
236,XI,XI
237,XI,
238,XI,"East, ah, east of Himalay,"
239,XI,Dwell the nations underground;
240,XI,"Hiding from the shock of Day,"
241,XI,For the sun’s uprising-sound:
242,XI,Dare not issue from the ground
243,XI,"At the tumults of the Day,"
244,XI,So fearfully the sun doth sound
245,XI,Clanging up beyond Cathay;
246,XI,For the great earthquaking sunrise rolling up beyond Cathay.
247,XI,
248,XII,XII
249,XII,
250,XII,"Lend me, O lend me"
251,XII,"The terrors of that sound,"
252,XII,That its music may attend me.
253,XII,Wrap my chant in thunders round;
254,XII,While I tell the ancient secrets in that Lady’s singing found.
255,XII,
256,XIII,XIII
257,XIII,
258,XIII,"On Ararat there grew a vine,"
259,XIII,When Asia from her bathing rose;
260,XIII,Our first sailor made a twine
261,XIII,Thereof for his prefiguring brows.
262,XIII,Canst divine
263,XIII,"Where, upon our dusty earth, of that vine a cluster grows?"
264,XIII,
265,XIV,XIV
266,XIV,
267,XIV,On Golgotha there grew a thorn
268,XIV,Round the long-prefigured Brows.
269,XIV,"Mourn, O mourn!"
270,XIV,For the vine have we the spine?  Is this all the Heaven allows?
271,XIV,
272,XV,XV
273,XV,
274,XV,On Calvary was shook a spear;
275,XV,Press the point into thy heart—
276,XV,Joy and fear!
277,XV,All the spines upon the thorn into curling tendrils start.
278,XV,
279,XVI,XVI
280,XVI,
281,XVI,"O, dismay!"
282,XVI,"I, a wingless mortal, sporting"
283,XVI,With the tresses of the sun?
284,XVI,"I, that dare my hand to lay"
285,XVI,On the thunder in its snorting?
286,XVI,"Ere begun,"
287,XVI,"Falls my singed song down the sky, even the old Icarian way."
288,XVI,
289,XVII,XVII
290,XVII,
291,XVII,From the fall precipitant
292,XVII,These dim snatches of her chant
293,XVII,Only have remainèd mine;—
294,XVII,That from spear and thorn alone
295,XVII,May be grown
296,XVII,For the front of saint or singer any divinizing twine.
297,XVII,
298,XVIII,XVIII
299,XVIII,
300,XVIII,Her song said that no springing
301,XVIII,Paradise but evermore
302,XVIII,Hangeth on a singing
303,XVIII,"That has chords of weeping,"
304,XVIII,And that sings the after-sleeping
305,XVIII,To souls which wake too sore.
306,XVIII,"‘But woe the singer, woe!’ she said; ‘beyond the dead his"
307,XVIII,"singing-lore,"
308,XVIII,"All its art of sweet and sore,"
309,XVIII,"He learns, in Elenore!’"
310,XVIII,
311,XIX,XIX
312,XIX,
313,XIX,"Where is the land of Luthany,"
314,XIX,Where is the tract of Elenore?
315,XIX,I am bound therefor.
316,XIX,
317,XX,XX
318,XX,
319,XX,‘Pierce thy heart to find the key;
320,XX,With thee take
321,XX,Only what none else would keep;
322,XX,"Learn to dream when thou dost wake,"
323,XX,Learn to wake when thou dost sleep.
324,XX,"Learn to water joy with tears,"
325,XX,Learn from fears to vanquish fears;
326,XX,"To hope, for thou dar’st not despair,"
327,XX,"Exult, for that thou dar’st not grieve;"
328,XX,Plough thou the rock until it bear;
329,XX,"Know, for thou else couldst not believe;"
330,XX,"Lose, that the lost thou may’st receive;"
331,XX,"Die, for none other way canst live."
332,XX,"When earth and heaven lay down their veil,"
333,XX,And that apocalypse turns thee pale;
334,XX,When thy seeing blindeth thee
335,XX,To what thy fellow-mortals see;
336,XX,When their sight to thee is sightless;
337,XX,"Their living, death; their light, most lightless;"
338,XX,Search no more—
339,XX,"Pass the gates of Luthany, tread the region Elenore.’"
340,XX,
341,XXI,XXI
342,XXI,
343,XXI,"Where is the land of Luthany,"
344,XXI,And where the region Elenore?
345,XXI,I do faint therefor.
346,XXI,‘When to the new eyes of thee
347,XXI,"All things by immortal power,"
348,XXI,"Near or far,"
349,XXI,Hiddenly
350,XXI,"To each other linkèd are,"
351,XXI,That thou canst not stir a flower
352,XXI,Without troubling of a star;
353,XXI,When thy song is shield and mirror
354,XXI,"To the fair snake-curlèd Pain,"
355,XXI,Where thou dar’st affront her terror
356,XXI,That on her thou may’st attain
357,XXI,"Persean conquest; seek no more,"
358,XXI,O seek no more!
359,XXI,"Pass the gates of Luthany, tread the region Elenore.’"
360,XXI,
361,XXII,XXII
362,XXII,
363,XXII,"So sang she, so wept she,"
364,XXII,Through a dream-night’s day;
365,XXII,And with her magic singing kept she—
366,XXII,Mystical in music—
367,XXII,That garden of enchanting
368,XXII,In visionary May;
369,XXII,"Swayless for my spirit’s haunting,"
370,XXII,Thrice-threefold walled with emerald from our mortal mornings grey.
371,XXII,
372,XXIII,XXIII
373,XXIII,
374,XXIII,And as a necromancer
375,XXIII,Raises from the rose-ash
376,XXIII,The ghost of the rose;
377,XXIII,My heart so made answer
378,XXIII,"To her voice’s silver plash,—"
379,XXIII,"Stirred in reddening flash,"
380,XXIII,And from out its mortal ruins the purpureal phantom blows.
381,XXIII,
382,XXIV,XXIV
383,XXIV,
384,XXIV,"Her tears made dulcet fretting,"
385,XXIV,"Her voice had no word,"
386,XXIV,More than thunder or the bird.
387,XXIV,"Yet, unforgetting,"
388,XXIV,"The ravished soul her meanings knew.  Mine ears heard not, and I"
389,XXIV,heard.
390,XXIV,
391,XXV,XXV
392,XXV,
393,XXV,When she shall unwind
394,XXV,"All those wiles she wound about me,"
395,XXV,"Tears shall break from out me,"
396,XXV,That I cannot find
397,XXV,"Music in the holy poets to my wistful want, I doubt me!"

402,CONTEMPLATION,
403,CONTEMPLATION,
404,CONTEMPLATION,"THIS morning saw I, fled the shower,"
405,CONTEMPLATION,The earth reclining in a lull of power:
406,CONTEMPLATION,"The heavens, pursuing not their path,"
407,CONTEMPLATION,"Lay stretched out naked after bath,"
408,CONTEMPLATION,"Or so it seemed; field, water, tree, were still,"
409,CONTEMPLATION,Nor was there any purpose on the calm-browed hill.
410,CONTEMPLATION,
411,CONTEMPLATION,"The hill, which sometimes visibly is"
412,CONTEMPLATION,"Wrought with unresting energies,"
413,CONTEMPLATION,"Looked idly; from the musing wood,"
414,CONTEMPLATION,"And every rock, a life renewed"
415,CONTEMPLATION,Exhaled like an unconscious thought
416,CONTEMPLATION,"When poets, dreaming unperplexed,"
417,CONTEMPLATION,Dream that they dream of nought.
418,CONTEMPLATION,"Nature one hour appears a thing unsexed,"
419,CONTEMPLATION,Or to such serene balance brought
420,CONTEMPLATION,"That her twin natures cease their sweet alarms,"
421,CONTEMPLATION,And sleep in one another’s arms.
422,CONTEMPLATION,"The sun with resting pulses seems to brood,"
423,CONTEMPLATION,And slacken its command upon my unurged blood.
424,CONTEMPLATION,
425,CONTEMPLATION,The river has not any care
426,CONTEMPLATION,Its passionless water to the sea to bear;
427,CONTEMPLATION,The leaves have brown content;
428,CONTEMPLATION,"The wall to me has freshness like a scent,"
429,CONTEMPLATION,"And takes half animate the air,"
430,CONTEMPLATION,Making one life with its green moss and stain;
431,CONTEMPLATION,And life with all things seems too perfect blent
432,CONTEMPLATION,For anything of life to be aware.
433,CONTEMPLATION,"The very shades on hill, and tree, and plain,"
434,CONTEMPLATION,"Where they have fallen doze, and where they doze remain."
435,CONTEMPLATION,
436,CONTEMPLATION,No hill can idler be than I;
437,CONTEMPLATION,No stone its inter-particled vibration
438,CONTEMPLATION,Investeth with a stiller lie;
439,CONTEMPLATION,No heaven with a more urgent rest betrays
440,CONTEMPLATION,The eyes that on it gaze.
441,CONTEMPLATION,We are too near akin that thou shouldst cheat
442,CONTEMPLATION,"Me, Nature, with thy fair deceit."
443,CONTEMPLATION,
444,CONTEMPLATION,In poets floating like a water-flower
445,CONTEMPLATION,"Upon the bosom of the glassy hour,"
446,CONTEMPLATION,"In skies that no man sees to move,"
447,CONTEMPLATION,"Lurk untumultuous vortices of power,"

461,CONTEMPLATION,"Till, all containing, he exalt"

464,CONTEMPLATION,"When, like a city under ocean,"
465,CONTEMPLATION,"To human things he grows a desolation,"
466,CONTEMPLATION,And is made a habitation
467,CONTEMPLATION,For the fluctuous universe
468,CONTEMPLATION,To lave with unimpeded motion.
469,CONTEMPLATION,He scarcely frets the atmosphere
470,CONTEMPLATION,"With breathing, and his body shares"

472,CONTEMPLATION,His heart’s a drop-well of tranquillity;
473,CONTEMPLATION,"His mind more still is than the limbs of fear,"

475,CONTEMPLATION,The spirit of the simoom mocks.
476,CONTEMPLATION,He round the solemn centre of his soul
477,CONTEMPLATION,"Wheels like a dervish, while his being is"
478,CONTEMPLATION,"Streamed with the set of the world’s harmonies,"
479,CONTEMPLATION,In the long draft of whatsoever sphere
480,CONTEMPLATION,He lists the sweet and clear

834,ORIENT ODE,Art thou not life of them that live?
835,ORIENT ODE,"Yea, in glad twinkling advent, thou dost dwell"
836,ORIENT ODE,Within our body as a tabernacle!
837,ORIENT ODE,Thou bittest with thine ordinance
838,ORIENT ODE,"The jaws of Time, and thou dost mete"
839,ORIENT ODE,The unsustainable treading of his feet.
840,ORIENT ODE,Thou to thy spousal universe
841,ORIENT ODE,"Art Husband, she thy Wife and Church;"
842,ORIENT ODE,"Who in most dusk and vidual curch,"
843,ORIENT ODE,"Her Lord being hence,"
844,ORIENT ODE,Keeps her cold sorrows by thy hearse.
845,ORIENT ODE,The heavens renew their innocence
846,ORIENT ODE,And morning state
847,ORIENT ODE,But by thy sacrament communicate:
848,ORIENT ODE,"Their weeping night the symbol of our prayers,"
849,ORIENT ODE,"Our darkened search,"
850,ORIENT ODE,And sinful vigil desolate.
851,ORIENT ODE,"Yea, biune in imploring dumb,"
852,ORIENT ODE,"Essential Heavens and corporal Earth await,"
853,ORIENT ODE,The Spirit and the Bride say: Come!
854,ORIENT ODE,"Lo, of thy Magians I the least"
855,ORIENT ODE,"Haste with my gold, my incenses and myrrhs,"
856,ORIENT ODE,"To thy desired epiphany, from the spiced"
857,ORIENT ODE,Regions and odorous of Song’s traded East.
858,ORIENT ODE,"Thou, for the life of all that live"
859,ORIENT ODE,The victim daily born and sacrificed;
860,ORIENT ODE,To whom the pinion of this longing verse
861,ORIENT ODE,"Beats but with fire which first thyself did give,"
862,ORIENT ODE,"To thee, O Sun—or is’t perchance, to Christ?"
863,ORIENT ODE,
864,ORIENT ODE,"Ay, if men say that on all high heaven’s face"
865,ORIENT ODE,The saintly signs I trace

868,ORIENT ODE,When I with wingèd feet had run

872,ORIENT ODE,I should not heed thereout
873,ORIENT ODE,Consenting counsel won:—

1218,ST. JOHN.,Before it stretch and flutteringly unfold
1219,ST. JOHN.,"Its rumpled webs of amethyst-freaked, diaphanous gold."
1220,ST. JOHN.,"And what hard task abstracts me from delight,"
1221,ST. JOHN.,Filling with hopeless hope and dear despair
1222,ST. JOHN.,"The still-born day and parchèd fields of night,"
1223,ST. JOHN.,"That my old way of song, no longer fair,"
1224,ST. JOHN.,"For lack of serene care,"
1225,ST. JOHN.,"Is grown a stony and a weed-choked plot,"
1226,ST. JOHN.,"Thou only know’st aright,"
1227,ST. JOHN.,"Thou only know’st, for I know not."
1228,ST. JOHN.,How many songs must die that this may live!
1229,ST. JOHN.,"And shall this most rash hope and fugitive,"
1230,ST. JOHN.,Fulfilled with beauty and with might
1231,ST. JOHN.,"In days whose feet are rumorous on the air,"
1232,ST. JOHN.,Make me forget to grieve
1233,ST. JOHN.,"For songs which might have been, nor ever were?"
1234,ST. JOHN.,"Stern the denial, the travail slow,"
1235,ST. JOHN.,The struggling wall will scantly grow:
1236,ST. JOHN.,And though with that dread rite of sacrifice
1237,ST. JOHN.,"Ordained for during edifice,"
1238,ST. JOHN.,"How long, how long ago!"
1239,ST. JOHN.,Into that wall which will not thrive
1240,ST. JOHN.,"I build myself alive,"
1241,ST. JOHN.,"Ah, who shall tell me will the wall uprise?"
1242,ST. JOHN.,"Thou wilt not tell me, who dost only know!"
1243,ST. JOHN.,"Yet still in mind I keep,"

1249,ST. JOHN.,
1250,ST. JOHN.,"‘And blindly,’ said I?—No!"
1251,ST. JOHN.,That saying I unsay: the wings
1252,ST. JOHN.,Hear I not in prævenient winnowings
1253,ST. JOHN.,"Of coming songs, that lift my hair and stir it?"
1254,ST. JOHN.,What winds with music wet do the sweet storm foreshow!
1255,ST. JOHN.,Utter stagnation
1256,ST. JOHN.,"Is the solstitial slumber of the spirit,"
1257,ST. JOHN.,The blear and blank negation of all life:
1258,ST. JOHN.,"But these sharp questionings mean strife, and strife"
1259,ST. JOHN.,Is the negation of negation.
1260,ST. JOHN.,The thing from which I turn my troubled look
1261,ST. JOHN.,Fearing the gods’ rebuke;
1262,ST. JOHN.,"That perturbation putting glory on,"
1263,ST. JOHN.,As is the golden vortex in the West

1269,ST. JOHN.,That on my now first-mothered breast
1270,ST. JOHN.,"Pliest the strange wonder of thine infant lip,"
1271,ST. JOHN.,"What this aghast surprise of keenest panging,"
1272,ST. JOHN.,"Wherefrom I blench, and cry thy soft mouth rest?"
1273,ST. JOHN.,"Ah hold, withhold, and let the sweet mouth slip!"
1274,ST. JOHN.,"So, with such pain, recoils the woolly dam,"
1275,ST. JOHN.,"Unused, affrighted, from her yeanling lamb:"
1276,ST. JOHN.,"I, one with her in cruel fellowship,"
1277,ST. JOHN.,Marvel what unmaternal thing I am.
1278,ST. JOHN.,
1279,ST. JOHN.,"Nature, enough! within thy glass"
1280,ST. JOHN.,Too many and too stern the shadows pass.
1281,ST. JOHN.,"In this delighted season, flaming"
1282,ST. JOHN.,"For thy resurrection-feast,"
1283,ST. JOHN.,"Ah, more I think the long ensepulture cold,"
1284,ST. JOHN.,Than stony winter rolled
1285,ST. JOHN.,From the unsealed mouth of the holy East;
1286,ST. JOHN.,The snowdrop’s saintly stoles less heed
1287,ST. JOHN.,Than the snow-cloistered penance of the seed.
1288,ST. JOHN.,’Tis the weak flesh reclaiming
1289,ST. JOHN.,Against the ordinance
1290,ST. JOHN.,Which yet for just the accepting spirit scans.
1291,ST. JOHN.,"Earth waits, and patient heaven,"
1292,ST. JOHN.,Self-bonded God doth wait
1293,ST. JOHN.,Thrice-promulgated bans
1294,ST. JOHN.,Of his fair nuptial-date.
1295,ST. JOHN.,"And power is man’s,"
1296,ST. JOHN.,"With that great word of ‘wait,’"
1297,ST. JOHN.,"To still the sea of tears,"
1298,ST. JOHN.,And shake the iron heart of Fate.
1299,ST. JOHN.,In that one word is strong
1300,ST. JOHN.,"An else, alas, much-mortal song;"
1301,ST. JOHN.,"With sight to pass the frontier of all spheres,"
1302,ST. JOHN.,And voice which does my sight such wrong.
1303,ST. JOHN.,
1304,ST. JOHN.,Not without fortitude I wait
1305,ST. JOHN.,The dark majestical ensuit
1306,ST. JOHN.,"Of destiny, nor peevish rate"
1307,ST. JOHN.,Calm-knowledged Fate.
1308,ST. JOHN.,"I, that no part have in the time’s bragged way,"
1309,ST. JOHN.,And its loud bruit
1310,ST. JOHN.,"I, in this house so rifted, marred,"
1311,ST. JOHN.,"So ill to live in, hard to leave;"
1312,ST. JOHN.,"I, so star-weary, over-warred,"
1313,ST. JOHN.,That have no joy in this your day—
1314,ST. JOHN.,"Rather foul fume englutting, that of day"
1315,ST. JOHN.,Confounds all ray—
1316,ST. JOHN.,But only stand aside and grieve;
1317,ST. JOHN.,"I yet have sight beyond the smoke,"
1318,ST. JOHN.,"And kiss the gods’ feet, though they wreak"
1319,ST. JOHN.,Upon me stroke and again stroke;
1320,ST. JOHN.,And this my seeing is not weak.
1321,ST. JOHN.,"The Woman I behold, whose vision seek"
1322,ST. JOHN.,All eyes and know not; t’ward whom climb
1323,ST. JOHN.,"The steps o’ the world, and beats all wing of rhyme,"
1324,ST. JOHN.,And knows not; ’twixt the sun and moon
1325,ST. JOHN.,Her inexpressible front enstarred
1326,ST. JOHN.,Tempers the wrangling spheres to tune;
1327,ST. JOHN.,Their divergent harmonies
1328,ST. JOHN.,"Concluded in the concord of her eyes,"
1329,ST. JOHN.,And vestal dances of her glad regard.
1330,ST. JOHN.,"I see, which fretteth with surmise"
1331,ST. JOHN.,"Much heads grown unsagacious-grey,"
1332,ST. JOHN.,"The slow aim of wise-hearted Time,"
1333,ST. JOHN.,Which folded cycles within cycles cloak:
1334,ST. JOHN.,"We pass, we pass, we pass; this does not pass away,"
1335,ST. JOHN.,But holds the furrowing earth still harnessed to its yoke.
1336,ST. JOHN.,The stars still write their golden purposes
1337,ST. JOHN.,"On heaven’s high palimpsest, and no man sees,"
1338,ST. JOHN.,Nor any therein Daniel; I do hear
1339,ST. JOHN.,From the revolving year
1340,ST. JOHN.,A voice which cries:
1341,ST. JOHN.,‘All dies;
1342,ST. JOHN.,"Lo, how all dies!  O seer,"
1343,ST. JOHN.,And all things too arise:
1344,ST. JOHN.,"All dies, and all is born;"
1345,ST. JOHN.,"But each resurgent morn, behold, more near the Perfect Morn.’"
1346,ST. JOHN.,
1347,ST. JOHN.,"Firm is the man, and set beyond the cast"
1348,ST. JOHN.,"Of Fortune’s game, and the iniquitous hour,"
1349,ST. JOHN.,"Whose falcon soul sits fast,"
1350,ST. JOHN.,And not intends her high sagacious tour
1351,ST. JOHN.,Or ere the quarry sighted; who looks past
1352,ST. JOHN.,"To slow much sweet from little instant sour,"
1353,ST. JOHN.,And in the first does always see the last.

1360,ANY SAINT,HIS shoulder did I hold
1361,ANY SAINT,"Too high that I, o’erbold"
1362,ANY SAINT,"Weak one,"
1363,ANY SAINT,Should lean thereon.
1364,ANY SAINT,
1365,ANY SAINT,But He a little hath
1366,ANY SAINT,Declined His stately path
1367,ANY SAINT,And my
1368,ANY SAINT,Feet set more high;
1369,ANY SAINT,
1370,ANY SAINT,That the slack arm may reach
1371,ANY SAINT,"His shoulder, and faint speech"
1372,ANY SAINT,Stir
1373,ANY SAINT,His unwithering hair.
1374,ANY SAINT,
1375,ANY SAINT,And bolder now and bolder
1376,ANY SAINT,I lean upon that shoulder
1377,ANY SAINT,So dear
1378,ANY SAINT,He is and near:
1379,ANY SAINT,
1380,ANY SAINT,And with His aureole
1381,ANY SAINT,The tresses of my soul

1385,ANY SAINT,"Yes, this too gentle Lover"

1390,ANY SAINT,"Ah, Love! somewhat let be!"
1391,ANY SAINT,Lest my humility

1393,ANY SAINT,When thou dost speak!
1394,ANY SAINT,
1395,ANY SAINT,"Rebate thy tender suit,"
1396,ANY SAINT,Lest to herself impute
1397,ANY SAINT,Some worth
1398,ANY SAINT,Thy bride of earth!
1399,ANY SAINT,
1400,ANY SAINT,A maid too easily
1401,ANY SAINT,Conceits herself to be
1402,ANY SAINT,Those things
1403,ANY SAINT,Her lover sings;

1406,ANY SAINT,Believes herself the Good

1417,ANY SAINT,Allure
1418,ANY SAINT,A love unsure.

1429,ANY SAINT,
1430,ANY SAINT,In whom eternally
1431,ANY SAINT,"Thou, Light, dost focus Thee!—"
1432,ANY SAINT,Didst pave

1439,ANY SAINT,
1440,ANY SAINT,"Unto him, only him;"

1445,ANY SAINT,In this small ring of flesh;
1446,ANY SAINT,The sky’s gold-knotted mesh
1447,ANY SAINT,Thy wrist
1448,ANY SAINT,Did only twist

1450,ANY SAINT,To take him in that net.—

1455,ANY SAINT,"Lo, God’s two worlds immense,"
1456,ANY SAINT,"Of spirit and of sense,"

1461,ANY SAINT,Answers the seraphim
1462,ANY SAINT,Athwart
1463,ANY SAINT,Thy body’s court!
1464,ANY SAINT,
1465,ANY SAINT,Great arm-fellow of God!
1466,ANY SAINT,To the ancestral clod
1467,ANY SAINT,"Kin,"
1468,ANY SAINT,And to cherubin;

1470,ANY SAINT,Bread predilectedly
1471,ANY SAINT,O’ the worm and Deity!
1472,ANY SAINT,"Hark,"
1473,ANY SAINT,"O God’s clay-sealed Ark,"
1474,ANY SAINT,
1475,ANY SAINT,"To praise that fits thee, clear"

1500,ANY SAINT,Primer where the angels all

1532,ANY SAINT,So best
1533,ANY SAINT,God loves to jest
1534,ANY SAINT,
1535,ANY SAINT,With children small—a freak
1536,ANY SAINT,Of heavenly hide-and-seek
1537,ANY SAINT,Fit
1538,ANY SAINT,"For thy wayward wit,"

1540,ANY SAINT,Who art thyself a thing

1554,ANY SAINT,
1555,ANY SAINT,To feel thyself and be

1559,ANY SAINT,
1560,ANY SAINT,"In the thunder-spout of Him,"
1561,ANY SAINT,"Until thy being dim,"
1562,ANY SAINT,And be

2149,LOVE DECLARED,Of that desirèd minute!  Then I leaned
2150,LOVE DECLARED,"Doubting; whereat she lifted—oh, brave eyes"
2151,LOVE DECLARED,Unfrighted:—forward like a wind-blown flame
2152,LOVE DECLARED,Came bosom and mouth to mine!
2153,LOVE DECLARED,That falling kiss
2154,LOVE DECLARED,"Touching long-laid expectance, all went up"

2170,LOVE DECLARED,"Within our shaken hearts the air of passion,"
2171,LOVE DECLARED,"Cleft by his sudden coming, eddies still"
2172,LOVE DECLARED,And whirs round his enchanted movelessness.
2173,LOVE DECLARED,
2174,LOVE DECLARED,"A film of trance between two stirrings!  Lo,"
2175,LOVE DECLARED,It bursts; yet dream’s snapped links cling round the limbs
2176,LOVE DECLARED,Of waking: like a running evening stream
2177,LOVE DECLARED,"Which no man hears, or sees, or knows to run,"
2178,LOVE DECLARED,"(Glazed with dim quiet), save that there the moon"
2179,LOVE DECLARED,"Is shattered to a creamy flicker of flame,"

2213,THE WAY OF A MAID,That full speech were full impotence;

2935,ANTHEM,Since Time was first a fledgling;
2936,ANTHEM,Yet thou may’st be but as a pendant bulla
2937,ANTHEM,Against his stripling bosom swung.  Alack!
2938,ANTHEM,For that we seem indeed
2939,ANTHEM,"To have slipped the world’s great leaping-time, and come"
2940,ANTHEM,"Upon thy pinched and dozing days: these weeds,"
2941,ANTHEM,"These corporal leavings, thou not cast’st us new,"
2942,ANTHEM,"Fresh from thy craftship, like the lilies’ coats,"
2943,ANTHEM,But foist’st us off
2944,ANTHEM,"With hasty tarnished piecings negligent,"
2945,ANTHEM,Snippets and waste
2946,ANTHEM,"From old ancestral wearings,"
2947,ANTHEM,That have seen sorrier usage; remainder-flesh
2948,ANTHEM,"After our father’s surfeits; nay with chinks,"
2949,ANTHEM,"Some of us, that if speech may have free leave"
2950,ANTHEM,Our souls go out at elbows.  We are sad
2951,ANTHEM,"With more than our sires’ heaviness, and with"
2952,ANTHEM,More than their weakness weak; we shall not be
2953,ANTHEM,"Mighty with all their mightiness, nor shall not"
2954,ANTHEM,"Rejoice with all their joy.  Ay, Mother!  Mother!"
2955,ANTHEM,"What is this Man, thy darling kissed and cuffed,"
2956,ANTHEM,"Thou lustingly engender’st,"
2957,ANTHEM,"To sweat, and make his brag, and rot,"
2958,ANTHEM,Crowned with all honour and all shamefulness?
2959,ANTHEM,From nightly towers
2960,ANTHEM,"He dogs the secret footsteps of the heavens,"
2961,ANTHEM,"Sifts in his hands the stars, weighs them as gold-dust,"
2962,ANTHEM,And yet is he successive unto nothing
2963,ANTHEM,"But patrimony of a little mould,"
2964,ANTHEM,And entail of four planks.  Thou hast made his mouth
2965,ANTHEM,"Avid of all dominion and all mightiness,"
2966,ANTHEM,"All sorrow, all delight, all topless grandeurs,"
2967,ANTHEM,"All beauty, and all starry majesties,"
2968,ANTHEM,"And dim transtellar things;—even that it may,"
2969,ANTHEM,"Filled in the ending with a puff of dust,"
2970,ANTHEM,Confess—‘It is enough.’  The world left empty
2971,ANTHEM,What that poor mouthful crams.  His heart is builded
2972,ANTHEM,"For pride, for potency, infinity,"
2973,ANTHEM,"All heights, all deeps, and all immensities,"
2974,ANTHEM,"Arrased with purple like the house of kings,—"
2975,ANTHEM,"To stall the grey-rat, and the carrion-worm"
2976,ANTHEM,Statelily lodge.  Mother of mysteries!
2977,ANTHEM,"Sayer of dark sayings in a thousand tongues,"
2978,ANTHEM,Who bringest forth no saying yet so dark
2979,ANTHEM,"As we ourselves, thy darkest!  We the young,"
2980,ANTHEM,"In a little thought, in a little thought,"
2981,ANTHEM,"At last confront thee, and ourselves in thee,"
2982,ANTHEM,And wake disgarmented of glory: as one
2983,ANTHEM,"On a mount standing, and against him stands,"
2984,ANTHEM,"On the mount adverse, crowned with westering rays,"
2985,ANTHEM,"The golden sun, and they two brotherly"
2986,ANTHEM,Gaze each on each;
2987,ANTHEM,He faring down
2988,ANTHEM,"To the dull vale, his Godhead peels from him"
2989,ANTHEM,Till he can scarcely spurn the pebble—
2990,ANTHEM,For nothingness of new-found mortality—
2991,ANTHEM,That mutinies against his gallèd foot.
2992,ANTHEM,"Littly he sets him to the daily way,"
2993,ANTHEM,"With all around the valleys growing grave,"
2994,ANTHEM,"And known things changed and strange; but he holds on,"
2995,ANTHEM,"Though all the land of light be widowèd,"
2996,ANTHEM,In a little thought.
2997,ANTHEM,
2998,ANTHEM,"In a little strength, in a little strength,"
2999,ANTHEM,"We affront thy unveiled face intolerable,"
3000,ANTHEM,Which yet we do sustain.
3001,ANTHEM,Though I the Orient never more shall feel
3002,ANTHEM,"Break like a clash of cymbals, and my heart"
3003,ANTHEM,Clang through my shaken body like a gong;
3004,ANTHEM,Nor ever more with spurted feet shall tread
3005,ANTHEM,I’ the winepresses of song; nought’s truly lost
3006,ANTHEM,That moulds to sprout forth gain: now I have on me
3007,ANTHEM,"The high Phœbean priesthood, and that craves"
3008,ANTHEM,An unrash utterance; not with flaunted hem
3009,ANTHEM,"May the Muse enter in behind the veil,"
3010,ANTHEM,"Nor, though we hold the sacred dances good,"
3011,ANTHEM,Shall the holy Virgins mænadize: ruled lips
3012,ANTHEM,Befit a votaress Muse.
3013,ANTHEM,"Thence with no mutable, nor no gelid love,"
3014,ANTHEM,"I keep, O Earth, thy worship,"
3015,ANTHEM,"Though life slow, and the sobering Genius change"
3016,ANTHEM,To a lamp his gusty torch.  What though no more
3017,ANTHEM,Athwart its roseal glow
3018,ANTHEM,Thy face look forth triumphal?  Thou put’st on
3019,ANTHEM,Strange sanctities of pathos; like this knoll
3020,ANTHEM,"Made derelict of day,"
3021,ANTHEM,Couchant and shadowèd
3022,ANTHEM,Under dim Vesper’s overloosened hair:
3023,ANTHEM,"This, where embossèd with the half-blown seed"
3024,ANTHEM,The solemn purple thistle stands in grass
3025,ANTHEM,"Grey as an exhalation, when the bank"
3026,ANTHEM,Holds mist for water in the nights of Fall.
3027,ANTHEM,"Not to the boy, although his eyes be pure"
3028,ANTHEM,"As the prime snowdrop is,"
3029,ANTHEM,Ere the rash Phœbus break her cloister
3030,ANTHEM,Of sanctimonious snow;
3031,ANTHEM,Or Winter fasting sole on Himalay
3032,ANTHEM,Since those dove-nuncioed days
3033,ANTHEM,When Asia rose from bathing;
3034,ANTHEM,"Not to such eyes,"
3035,ANTHEM,"Uneuphrasied with tears, the hierarchical"
3036,ANTHEM,"Vision lies unoccult, rank under rank"
3037,ANTHEM,"Through all create down-wheeling, from the Throne"
3038,ANTHEM,Even to the bases of the pregnant ooze.
3039,ANTHEM,"This is the enchantment, this the exaltation,"
3040,ANTHEM,"The all-compensating wonder,"
3041,ANTHEM,Giving to common things wild kindred
3042,ANTHEM,With the gold-tesserate floors of Jove;
3043,ANTHEM,Linking such heights and such humilities
3044,ANTHEM,"Hand in hand in ordinal dances,"
3045,ANTHEM,"That I do think my tread,"
3046,ANTHEM,"Stirring the blossoms in the meadow-grass,"
3047,ANTHEM,Flickers the unwithering stars.
3048,ANTHEM,This to the shunless fardel of the world
3049,ANTHEM,"Nerves my uncurbèd back; that I endure,"
3050,ANTHEM,"The monstrous Temple’s moveless caryatid,"
3051,ANTHEM,"With wide eyes calm upon the whole of things,"
3052,ANTHEM,In a little strength.
3053,ANTHEM,
3054,ANTHEM,"In a little sight, in a little sight,"
3055,ANTHEM,We learn from what in thee is credible
3056,ANTHEM,"The incredible, with bloody clutch and feet"
3057,ANTHEM,Clinging the painful juts of jaggèd faith.
3058,ANTHEM,"Science, old noser in its prideful straw,"
3059,ANTHEM,That with anatomising scalpel tents
3060,ANTHEM,"Its three-inch of thy skin, and brags—‘All’s bare,’"
3061,ANTHEM,"The eyeless worm, that boring works the soil,"
3062,ANTHEM,Making it capable for the crops of God;
3063,ANTHEM,Against its own dull will
3064,ANTHEM,"Ministers poppies to our troublous thought,"
3065,ANTHEM,"A Balaam come to prophecy,—parables,"
3066,ANTHEM,"Nor of its parable itself is ware,"
3067,ANTHEM,Grossly unwotting; all things has expounded
3068,ANTHEM,"Reflux and influx, counts the sepulchre"
3069,ANTHEM,"The seminary of being, and extinction"
3070,ANTHEM,The Ceres of existence: it discovers
3071,ANTHEM,"Life in putridity, vigour in decay;"
3072,ANTHEM,"Dissolution even, and disintegration,"
3073,ANTHEM,"Which in our dull thoughts symbolise disorder,"
3074,ANTHEM,"Finds in God’s thoughts irrefragable order,"
3075,ANTHEM,And admirable the manner of our corruption
3076,ANTHEM,As of our health.  It grafts upon the cypress
3077,ANTHEM,The tree of Life—Death dies on his own dart
3078,ANTHEM,"Promising to our ashes perpetuity,"
3079,ANTHEM,And to our perishable elements
3080,ANTHEM,Their proper imperishability; extracting
3081,ANTHEM,Medicaments from out mortality
3082,ANTHEM,Against too mortal cogitation; till
3083,ANTHEM,Even of the caput mortuum we do thus
3084,ANTHEM,Make a memento vivere.  To such uses
3085,ANTHEM,"I put the blinding knowledge of the fool,"
3086,ANTHEM,Who in no order seeth ordinance;
3087,ANTHEM,"Nor thrust my arm in nature shoulder-high,"
3088,ANTHEM,"And cry—‘There’s nought beyond!’  How should I so,"
3089,ANTHEM,That cannot with these arms of mine engirdle
3090,ANTHEM,All which I am; that am a foreigner
3091,ANTHEM,In mine own region?  Who the chart shall draw
3092,ANTHEM,"Of the strange courts and vaulty labyrinths,"
3093,ANTHEM,"The spacious tenements and wide pleasances,"
3094,ANTHEM,"Innumerable corridors far-withdrawn,"
3095,ANTHEM,"Where I wander darkling, of myself?"
3096,ANTHEM,"Darkling I wander, nor I dare explore"
3097,ANTHEM,"The long arcane of those dim catacombs,"
3098,ANTHEM,"Where the rat memory does its burrows make,"
3099,ANTHEM,"Close-seal them as I may, and my stolen tread"
3100,ANTHEM,"Starts populace, a _gens lucifuga_;"
3101,ANTHEM,"That too strait seems my mind my mind to hold,"
3102,ANTHEM,And I myself incontinent of me.
3103,ANTHEM,"Then go I, my foul-venting ignorance"
3104,ANTHEM,"With scabby sapience plastered, aye forsooth!"
3105,ANTHEM,"Clap my wise foot-rule to the walls o’ the world,"
3106,ANTHEM,"And vow—_A goodly house_, _but something ancient_,"
3107,ANTHEM,"_And I can find no Master_?  Rather, nay,"
3108,ANTHEM,"By baffled seeing, something I divine"
3109,ANTHEM,"Which baffles, and a seeing set beyond;"
3110,ANTHEM,"And so with strenuous gazes sounding down,"
3111,ANTHEM,"Like to the day-long porer on a stream,"
3112,ANTHEM,"Whose last look is his deepest, I beside"
3113,ANTHEM,"This slow perpetual Time stand patiently,"
3114,ANTHEM,In a little sight.
3115,ANTHEM,
3116,ANTHEM,"In a little dust, in a little dust,"
3117,ANTHEM,"Earth, thou reclaim’st us, who do all our lives"
3118,ANTHEM,Find of thee but Egyptian villeinage.
3119,ANTHEM,"Thou dost this body, this enhavocked realm,"
3120,ANTHEM,Subject to ancient and ancestral shadows;
3121,ANTHEM,Descended passions sway it; it is distraught
3122,ANTHEM,"With ghostly usurpation, dinned and fretted"
3123,ANTHEM,"With the still-tyrannous dead; a haunted tenement,"
3124,ANTHEM,Peopled from barrows and outworn ossuaries.
3125,ANTHEM,Thou giv’st us life not half so willingly
3126,ANTHEM,As thou undost thy giving; thou that teem’st
3127,ANTHEM,"The stealthy terror of the sinuous pard,"
3128,ANTHEM,"The lion maned with curlèd puissance,"
3129,ANTHEM,"The serpent, and all fair strong beasts of ravin,"
3130,ANTHEM,Thyself most fair and potent beast of ravin;
3131,ANTHEM,"And thy great eaters thou, the greatest, eat’st."
3132,ANTHEM,"Thou hast devoured mammoth and mastodon,"
3133,ANTHEM,"And many a floating bank of fangs,"
3134,ANTHEM,"The scaly scourges of thy primal brine,"
3135,ANTHEM,And the tower-crested plesiosaure.
3136,ANTHEM,"Thou fill’st thy mouth with nations, gorgest slow"
3137,ANTHEM,On purple æons of kings; man’s hulking towers
3138,ANTHEM,"Are carcase for thee, and to modern sun"
3139,ANTHEM,Disglutt’st their splintered bones.
3140,ANTHEM,Rabble of Pharaohs and Arsacidæ
3141,ANTHEM,Keep their cold house within thee; thou hast sucked down
3142,ANTHEM,"How many Ninevehs and Hecatompyloi,"
3143,ANTHEM,And perished cities whose great phantasmata
3144,ANTHEM,O’erbrow the silent citizens of Dis:—
3145,ANTHEM,Hast not thy fill?
3146,ANTHEM,"Tarry awhile, lean Earth, for thou shalt drink,"
3147,ANTHEM,"Even till thy dull throat sicken,"
3148,ANTHEM,The draught thou grow’st most fat on; hear’st thou not
3149,ANTHEM,The world’s knives bickering in their sheaths?  O patience!
3150,ANTHEM,"Much offal of a foul world comes thy way,"
3151,ANTHEM,And man’s superfluous cloud shall soon be laid
3152,ANTHEM,In a little blood.
3153,ANTHEM,
3154,ANTHEM,"In a little peace, in a little peace,"
3155,ANTHEM,Thou dost rebate thy rigid purposes
3156,ANTHEM,"Of imposed being, and relenting, mend’st"
3157,ANTHEM,"Too much, with nought.  The westering Phoebus’ horse"
3158,ANTHEM,Paws i’ the lucent dust as when he shocked
3159,ANTHEM,The East with rising; O how may I trace
3160,ANTHEM,In this decline that morning when we did
3161,ANTHEM,"Sport ’twixt the claws of newly-whelped existence,"
3162,ANTHEM,Which had not yet learned rending? we did then
3163,ANTHEM,"Divinely stand, not knowing yet against us"
3164,ANTHEM,"Sentence had passed of life, nor commutation"
3165,ANTHEM,Petitioning into death.  What’s he that of
3166,ANTHEM,"The Free State argues?  Tellus! bid him stoop,"
3167,ANTHEM,Even where the low _hic jacet_ answers him;
3168,ANTHEM,"Thus low, O Man! there’s freedom’s seignory,"
3169,ANTHEM,"Tellus’ most reverend sole free commonweal,"
3170,ANTHEM,And model deeply-policied: there none
3171,ANTHEM,"Stands on precedence, nor ambitiously"
3172,ANTHEM,"Woos the impartial worm, whose favours kiss"
3173,ANTHEM,With liberal largesse all; there each is free
3174,ANTHEM,"To be e’en what he must, which here did strive"
3175,ANTHEM,So much to be he could not; there all do
3176,ANTHEM,"Their uses just, with no flown questioning."
3177,ANTHEM,To be took by the hand of equal earth
3178,ANTHEM,"They doff her livery, slip to the worm,"
3179,ANTHEM,"Which lacqueys them, their suits of maintenance,"
3180,ANTHEM,"And that soiled workaday apparel cast,"
3181,ANTHEM,Put on condition: Death’s ungentle buffet
3182,ANTHEM,Alone makes ceremonial manumission;
3183,ANTHEM,"So are the heavenly statutes set, and those"
3184,ANTHEM,Uranian tables of the primal Law.
3185,ANTHEM,"In a little peace, in a little peace,"
3186,ANTHEM,"Like fierce beasts that a common thirst makes brothers,"
3187,ANTHEM,We draw together to one hid dark lake;
3188,ANTHEM,"In a little peace, in a little peace,"
3189,ANTHEM,We drain with all our burthens of dishonour
3190,ANTHEM,Into the cleansing sands o’ the thirsty grave.
3191,ANTHEM,"The fiery pomps, brave exhalations,"
3192,ANTHEM,"And all the glistering shows o’ the seeming world,"
3193,ANTHEM,"Which the sight aches at, we unwinking see"
3194,ANTHEM,"Through the smoked glass of Death; Death, wherewith’s fined"
3195,ANTHEM,The muddy wine of life; that earth doth purge
3196,ANTHEM,"Of her plethora of man; Death, that doth flush"
3197,ANTHEM,The cumbered gutters of humanity;
3198,ANTHEM,"Nothing, of nothing king, with front uncrowned,"
3199,ANTHEM,Whose hand holds crownets; playmate swart o’ the strong;
3200,ANTHEM,Tenebrous moon that flux and refluence draws
3201,ANTHEM,Of the high-tided man; skull-housèd asp
3202,ANTHEM,"That stings the heel of kings; true Fount of Youth,"
3203,ANTHEM,Where he that dips is deathless; being’s drone-pipe;
3204,ANTHEM,"Whose nostril turns to blight the shrivelled stars,"
3205,ANTHEM,And thicks the lusty breathing of the sun;
3206,ANTHEM,"Pontifical Death, that doth the crevasse bridge"
3207,ANTHEM,To the steep and trifid God; one mortal birth
3208,ANTHEM,That broker is of immortality.
3209,ANTHEM,"Under this dreadful brother uterine,"
3210,ANTHEM,"This kinsman feared, Tellus, behold me come,"
3211,ANTHEM,"Thy son stern-nursed; who mortal-motherlike,"
3212,ANTHEM,"To turn thy weanlings’ mouth averse, embitter’st"
3213,ANTHEM,"Thine over-childed breast.  Now, mortal-sonlike,"
3214,ANTHEM,"I thou hast suckled, Mother, I at last"
3215,ANTHEM,"Shall sustenant be to thee.  Here I untrammel,"
3216,ANTHEM,"Here I pluck loose the body’s cerementing,"
3217,ANTHEM,And break the tomb of life; here I shake off
3218,ANTHEM,"The bur o’ the world, man’s congregation shun,"
3219,ANTHEM,And to the antique order of the dead
3220,ANTHEM,I take the tongueless vows: my cell is set
3221,ANTHEM,Here in thy bosom; my little trouble is ended
3222,ANTHEM,In a little peace.

3398,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"The Chaldee shepherds; sealèd from the proud,"
3399,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,To cheer the weighted heart that mates the seeing eye.
3400,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3401,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"A lonely man, oppressed with lonely ills,"
3402,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And all the glory fallen from my song,"
3403,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Here do I walk among the windy hills,"
3404,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,The wind and I keep both one monotoning tongue.
3405,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3406,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Like grey clouds one by one my songs upsoar
3407,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Over my soul’s cold peaks; and one by one
3408,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"They loose their little rain, and are no more;"
3409,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And whether well or ill, to tell me there is none."
3410,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,

3412,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"From all men’s care, how miserably apart!"
3413,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Even my friends say: ‘Of what is this he sings?’
3414,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And barren is my song, and barren is my heart."
3415,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3416,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"For who can work, unwitting his work’s worth?"
3417,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Better, meseems, to know the work for naught,"
3418,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Turn my sick course back to the kindly earth,"
3419,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And leave to ampler plumes the jetting tops of thought.
3420,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3421,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And visitations, that do often use,"
3422,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Remote, unhappy, inauspicious sense"
3423,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Of doom, and poets widowed of their muse,"
3424,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And what dark ’gan, dark ended, in me did commence."
3425,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3426,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"I thought of spirit wronged by mortal ills,"
3427,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And my flesh rotting on my fate’s dull stake;
3428,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And how self-scornèd they the bounty fills
3429,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Of others, and the bread, even of their dearest, take."
3430,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3431,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"I thought of Keats, that died in perfect time,"
3432,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,In predecease of his just-sickening song;
3433,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Of him that set, wrapt in his radiant rhyme,"
3434,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Sunlike in sea.  Life longer had been life too long.
3435,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,

3442,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Apollo’s song-bowed Scythian, I go on;"
3443,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Making in all my home, with pliant ways,"

3450,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3451,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,What cloud thus died I saw not; heaven was fair.
3452,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Methinks my angel plucked my locks: I bowed
3453,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"My spirit, shamed; and looking in the air:—"
3454,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"‘Even so,’ I said, ‘even so, my brother the good Cloud?’"
3455,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3456,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"It was a pilgrim of the fields of air,"
3457,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Its home was allwheres the wind left it rest,"
3458,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And in a little forth again did fare,"
3459,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And in all places was a stranger and a guest.
3460,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3461,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"It harked all breaths of heaven, and did obey"
3462,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,With sweet peace their uncomprehended wills;
3463,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"It knew the eyes of stars which made no stay,"
3464,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And with the thunder walked upon the lonely hills.
3465,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3466,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And from the subject earth it seemed to scorn,"
3467,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,It drew the sustenance whereby it grew
3468,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Perfect in bosom for the married Morn,"
3469,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And of his life and light full as a maid kissed new.
3470,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3471,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Its also darkness of the face withdrawn,"
3472,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And the long waiting for the little light,"
3473,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,So long in life so little.  Like a fawn
3474,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,It fled with tempest breathing hard at heel of flight;
3475,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3476,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And having known full East, did not disdain"
3477,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"To sit in shadow and oblivious cold,"
3478,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Save what all loss doth of its loss retain,"
3479,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And who hath held hath somewhat that he still must hold.
3480,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3481,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Right poet! who thy rightness to approve,"
3482,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Having all liberty, didst keep all measure,"
3483,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And with a firmament for ranging, move"
3484,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,But at the heavens’ uncomprehended pleasure.
3485,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3486,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"With amplitude unchecked, how sweetly thou"
3487,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Didst wear the ancient custom of the skies,"
3488,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And yoke of used prescription; and thence how
3489,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Find gay variety no license could devise!
3490,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3491,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,As we the quested beauties better wit
3492,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Of the one grove our own than forests great,"
3493,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Restraint, by the delighted search of it,"
3494,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Turns to right scope.  For lovely moving intricate
3495,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3496,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Is put to fair devising in the curb
3497,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Of ordered limit; and all-changeful Hermes
3498,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Is Terminus as well.  Yet we perturb
3499,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Our souls for latitude, whose strength in bound and term is."
3500,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3501,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"How far am I from heavenly liberty,"
3502,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"That play at policy with change and fate,"
3503,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Who should my soul from foreign broils keep free,"
3504,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,In the fast-guarded frontiers of its single state!
3505,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3506,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Could I face firm the Is, and with To-be"
3507,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Trust Heaven; to Heaven commit the deed, and do;"
3508,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"In power contained, calm in infirmity,"
3509,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,And fit myself to change with virtue ever new;
3510,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3511,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Thou hadst not shamed me, cousin of the sky,"
3512,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Thou wandering kinsman, that didst sweetly live"
3513,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Unnoted, and unnoted sweetly die,"
3514,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Weeping more gracious song than any I can weave;
3515,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3516,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Which these gross-tissued words do sorely wrong.
3517,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,Thou hast taught me on powerlessness a power;
3518,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"To make song wait on life, not life on song;"
3519,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"To hold sweet not too sweet, and bread for bread though sour;"
3520,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,
3521,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"By law to wander, to be strictly free."
3522,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"With tears ascended from the heart’s sad sea,"
3523,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Ah, such a silver song to Death could I"
3524,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"Sing, Pain would list, forgetting Pain to be,"
3525,THE CLOUD’S SWAN-SONG,"And Death would tarry marvelling, and forget to die!"

3544,TO THE SINKING SUN,Moves largely thy grave progressing.
3545,TO THE SINKING SUN,
3546,TO THE SINKING SUN,Here every eve thou goest down

3549,TO THE SINKING SUN,Behind the self-same hill;

3562,TO THE SINKING SUN,"For new in me is olden too,"
3563,TO THE SINKING SUN,That I for sameness grieve.
3564,TO THE SINKING SUN,O flowers! O grasses! be but once
3565,TO THE SINKING SUN,The grass and flower of yester-eve!
3566,TO THE SINKING SUN,
3567,TO THE SINKING SUN,Wonder and sadness are the lot
3568,TO THE SINKING SUN,Of change: thou yield’st mine eyes

3570,TO THE SINKING SUN,Its penetrant surprise.
3571,TO THE SINKING SUN,Immutability mutable

3577,TO THE SINKING SUN,"A dull, new, staled amaze!"

4366,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"She shares them not; their azures probe,"
4367,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,No countering wings thy flight endures.
4368,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Nay, they do stole"
4369,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Me like an aura of her soul.
4370,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"I yield them, love, for yours!"
4371,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4372,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"But mine these hills and fields, which put"
4373,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Not on the sanctity of her foot.
4374,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Far off, my dear, far off the sweet"
4375,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Grave pianissimo of your feet!
4376,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"My earth, perchance, your sway abjures?—"
4377,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Your absence broods
4378,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"O’er all, a subtler presence.  Woods,"
4379,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Fields, hills, all yours, all yours!"
4380,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4381,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Nay then, I said, I have my thought,"
4382,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Which never woman’s reaching raught;
4383,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Being strong beyond a woman’s might,"
4384,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"And high beyond a woman’s height,"
4385,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Shaped to my shape in all contours.—
4386,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"I looked, and knew"
4387,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,No thought but you were garden to.
4388,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"All yours, my love, all yours!"
4389,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4390,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Meseemeth still, I have my life;"
4391,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,All-clement Her its resolute strife
4392,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Evades; contained, relinquishing"
4393,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Her mitigating eyes; a thing
4394,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Which the whole girth of God secures.
4395,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Ah, fool, pause! pause!"
4396,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"I had no life, until it was"
4397,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"All yours, my love, all yours!"
4398,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4399,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Yet, stern possession!  I have my death,"
4400,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Sole yielding up of my sole breath;
4401,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Which all within myself I die,"
4402,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,All in myself must cry the cry
4403,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Which the deaf body’s wall immures.—
4404,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Thought fashioneth
4405,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"My death without her.—Ah, even death"
4406,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"All yours, my love, all yours!"
4407,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4408,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Death, then, he hers.  I have my heaven,"
4409,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,For which no arm of hers has striven;
4410,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Which solitary I must choose,"
4411,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,And solitary win or lose.—
4412,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Ah, but not heaven my own endures!"
4413,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,I must perforce
4414,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Taste you, my stream, in God your source,—"
4415,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,So steep my heaven in yours.
4416,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4417,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"At last I said—I have my God,"
4418,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Who doth desire me, though a clod,"
4419,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,And from His liberal Heaven shall He
4420,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Bar in mine arms His privacy.
4421,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Himself for mine Himself assures.—
4422,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,None shall deny
4423,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"God to be mine, but He and I"
4424,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"All yours, my love, all yours!"
4425,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4426,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,I have no fear at all lest I
4427,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,Without her draw felicity.
4428,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,God for His Heaven will not forego
4429,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Her whom I found such heaven below,"
4430,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,And she will train Him to her lures.
4431,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Nought, lady, I love"
4432,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,In you but more is loved above;
4433,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"What made me, makes Him yours."
4434,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,
4435,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"‘I, thy sought own, am I forgot?’"
4436,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Ha, thou?—thou liest, I seek thee not."
4437,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Why what, thou painted parrot, Fame,"
4438,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,What have I taught thee but her name?
4439,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Hear, thou slave Fame, while Time endures,"
4440,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,I give her thee;
4441,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Page her triumphal name!—Lady,"
4442,MY LADY THE TYRANNESS,"Take her, the thrall is yours."

4447,UNTO THIS LAST,
4448,UNTO THIS LAST,
4449,UNTO THIS LAST,A BOY’S young fancy taketh love
4450,UNTO THIS LAST,"Most simply, with the rind thereof;"
4451,UNTO THIS LAST,A boy’s young fancy tasteth more
4452,UNTO THIS LAST,"The rind, than the deific core."
4453,UNTO THIS LAST,"Ah, Sweet! to cast away the slips"
4454,UNTO THIS LAST,"Of unessential rind, and lips"
4455,UNTO THIS LAST,"Fix on the immortal core, is well;"
4456,UNTO THIS LAST,But heard’st thou ever any tell
4457,UNTO THIS LAST,Of such a fool would take for food
4458,UNTO THIS LAST,"Aspect and scent, however good,"
4459,UNTO THIS LAST,Of sweetest core Love’s orchards grow?
4460,UNTO THIS LAST,"Should such a phantast please him so,"
4461,UNTO THIS LAST,Love where Love’s reverent self denies
4462,UNTO THIS LAST,"Love to feed, but with his eyes,"
4463,UNTO THIS LAST,"All the savour, all the touch,"
4464,UNTO THIS LAST,Another’s—was there ever such?
4465,UNTO THIS LAST,"Such were fool, if fool there be;"
4466,UNTO THIS LAST,"Such fool was I, and was for thee!"

4469,UNTO THIS LAST,You unto another give
4470,UNTO THIS LAST,"For sacrosanct prerogative,"
4471,UNTO THIS LAST,Yet even scent and aspect were
4472,UNTO THIS LAST,Some elected Second’s share;
4473,UNTO THIS LAST,"And one, gone mad, should rest content"
4474,UNTO THIS LAST,With memory of show and scent;
4475,UNTO THIS LAST,"Would not thyself vow, if there sigh"
4476,UNTO THIS LAST,"Such a fool—say, Sweet, as I—"
4477,UNTO THIS LAST,Treble frenzy it must be
4478,UNTO THIS LAST,"Still to love, and to love thee?"
4479,UNTO THIS LAST,
4480,UNTO THIS LAST,"Yet had I torn (man knoweth not,"
4481,UNTO THIS LAST,Nor scarce the unweeping angels wot
4482,UNTO THIS LAST,Of such dread task the lightest part)
4483,UNTO THIS LAST,Her fingers from about my heart.
4484,UNTO THIS LAST,"Heart, did we not think that she"
4485,UNTO THIS LAST,Had surceased her tyranny?
4486,UNTO THIS LAST,"Heart, we bounded, and were free!"
4487,UNTO THIS LAST,O sacrilegious freedom!—Till
4488,UNTO THIS LAST,"She came, and taught my apostate will"
4489,UNTO THIS LAST,The winnowed sweet mirth cannot guess
4490,UNTO THIS LAST,And tear-fined peace of hopefulness;
4491,UNTO THIS LAST,"Looked, spake, simply touched, and went."
4492,UNTO THIS LAST,"Now old pain is fresh content,"
4493,UNTO THIS LAST,Proved content is unproved pain.
4494,UNTO THIS LAST,"Pangs fore-tempted, which in vain"
4495,UNTO THIS LAST,"I, faithless, have denied, now bud"
4496,UNTO THIS LAST,To untempted fragrance and the mood
4497,UNTO THIS LAST,Of contrite heavenliness; all days
4498,UNTO THIS LAST,Joy affrights me in my ways;
4499,UNTO THIS LAST,Extremities of old delight
4500,UNTO THIS LAST,Afflict me with new exquisite
4501,UNTO THIS LAST,"Virgin piercings of surprise,—"
4502,UNTO THIS LAST,"Stung by those wild brown bees, her eyes!"

4508,ULTIMUM,
4509,ULTIMUM,"NOW in these last spent drops, slow, slower shed,"
4510,ULTIMUM,"Love dies, Love dies, Love dies—ah, Love is dead!"
4511,ULTIMUM,"Sad Love in life, sore Love in agony,"
4512,ULTIMUM,"Pale Love in death; while all his offspring songs,"
4513,ULTIMUM,"Like children, versed not in death’s chilly wrongs,"
4514,ULTIMUM,"About him flit, frighted to see him lie"
4515,ULTIMUM,"So still, who did not know that Love could die."
4516,ULTIMUM,"One lifts his wing, where dulls the vermeil all"
4517,ULTIMUM,"Like clotting blood, and shrinks to find it cold,"
4518,ULTIMUM,And when she sees its lapse and nerveless fall
4519,ULTIMUM,"Clasps her fans, while her sobs ooze through the webbèd gold."
4520,ULTIMUM,"Thereat all weep together, and their tears"
4521,ULTIMUM,Make lights like shivered moonlight on long waters.
4522,ULTIMUM,"Have peace, O piteous daughters!"
4523,ULTIMUM,"He shall not wake more through the mortal years,"
4524,ULTIMUM,"Nor comfort come to my soul widowèd,"
4525,ULTIMUM,Nor breath to your wild wings; for Love is dead!
4526,ULTIMUM,
4527,ULTIMUM,"I slew, that moan for him: he lifted me"
4528,ULTIMUM,"Above myself, and that I might not be"
4529,ULTIMUM,"Less than myself, need was that he should die;"
4530,ULTIMUM,"Since Love that first did wing, now clogged me from the sky."
4531,ULTIMUM,Yet lofty Love being dead thus passeth base—
4532,ULTIMUM,"There is a soul of nobleness which stays,"
4533,ULTIMUM,"The spectre of the rose: be comforted,"
4534,ULTIMUM,"Songs, for the dust that dims his sacred head!"
4535,ULTIMUM,The days draw on too dark for Song or Love;
4536,ULTIMUM,"O peace, my songs, nor stir ye any wing!"
4537,ULTIMUM,"For lo, the thunder hushing all the grove,"
4538,ULTIMUM,"And did Love live, not even Love could sing."
4539,ULTIMUM,
4540,ULTIMUM,"And, Lady, thus I dare to say,"
4541,ULTIMUM,Not all with you is passed away!
4542,ULTIMUM,For your love taught me this:—’tis Love’s true praise
4543,ULTIMUM,"To be, not staff, but writ of worthy days;"
4544,ULTIMUM,And that high worth in love unfortunate
4545,ULTIMUM,Should still remain it learned in love elate.
4546,ULTIMUM,"Beyond your star, still, still the stars are bright;"
4547,ULTIMUM,"Beyond your highness, still I follow height;"
4548,ULTIMUM,"Sole I go forth, yet still to my sad view,"
4549,ULTIMUM,"Beyond your trueness, Lady, Truth stands true."
4550,ULTIMUM,"This wisdom sings my song with last firm breath,"
4551,ULTIMUM,"Caught from the twisted lore of Love and Death,"
4552,ULTIMUM,The strange inwoven harmony that wakes
4553,ULTIMUM,From Pallas’ straying locks twined with her ægis-snakes.
4554,ULTIMUM,"‘On him the unpetitioned heavens descend,"
4555,ULTIMUM,Who heaven on earth proposes not for end;
4556,ULTIMUM,The perilous and celestial excess
4557,ULTIMUM,"Taking with peace, lacking with thankfulness."
4558,ULTIMUM,"Bliss in extreme befits thee not, until"
4559,ULTIMUM,Thou’rt not extreme in bliss; be equal still:
4560,ULTIMUM,Sweets to be granted think thy self unmeet
4561,ULTIMUM,Till thou have learned to hold sweet not too sweet.’
4562,ULTIMUM,This thing not far is he from wise in art
4563,ULTIMUM,"Who teacheth; nor who doth, from wise in heart."
