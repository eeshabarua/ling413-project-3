182,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,In the seal-ring that burns
183,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,On the hand of the Master--

185,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,"Flames through the dim,"

193,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,To be staked in the pastime
194,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,Whose playing is more
195,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,Than the transfer of being;
196,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,"Arch-anarch, chief builder,"
197,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,"Prince and evangelist,"
198,THE SONG OF THE SWORD,I am the Will of God:

220,I,_Andante con mote_
221,I,
222,I,"Forth from the dust and din,"
223,I,"The crush, the heat, the many-spotted glare,"
224,I,"The odour and sense of life and lust aflare,"
225,I,"The wrangle and jangle of unrests,"
226,I,"Let us take horse, dear heart, take horse and win--"
227,I,As from swart August to the green lap of May--
228,I,To quietness and the fresh and fragrant breasts
229,I,"Of the still, delicious night, not yet aware"
230,I,In any of her innumerable nests
231,I,"Of that first sudden plash of dawn,"
232,I,"Clear, sapphirine, luminous, large,"
233,I,Which tells that soon the flowing springs of day
234,I,In deep and ever deeper eddies drawn
235,I,"Forward and up, in wider and wider way"
236,I,Shall float the sands and brim the shores
237,I,"On this our haunch of Earth, as round she roars"
238,I,And spins into the outlook of the Sun
239,I,"(The Lord's first gift, the Lord's especial charge)"
240,I,"With light, with living light, from marge to marge,"
241,I,Until the course He set and staked be run.
242,I,
243,I,"Through street and square, through square and street,"
244,I,Each with his home-grown quality of dark
245,I,"And violated silence, loud and fleet,"
246,I,"Waylaid by a merry ghost at every lamp,"
247,I,"The hansom wheels and plunges.  Hark, O hark,"
248,I,"Sweet, how the old mare's bit and chain"
249,I,Ring back a rough refrain
250,I,Upon the marked and cheerful tramp
251,I,"Of her four shoes!  Here is the Park,"
252,I,"And O the languid midsummer wafts adust,"
253,I,The tired midsummer blooms!
254,I,"O the mysterious distances, the glooms"
255,I,"Romantic, the august"
256,I,And solemn shapes!  At night this City of Trees
257,I,Tunis to a tryst of vague and strange
258,I,"And monstrous Majesties,"
259,I,Let loose from some dim underworld to range
260,I,These terrene vistas till their twilight sets:
261,I,"When, dispossessed of wonderfulness, they stand"
262,I,"Beggared and common, plain to all the land"
263,I,For stooks of leaves!  And lo! the wizard hour
264,I,"Whose shining, silent sorcery hath such power!"
265,I,"Still, still the streets, between their carcanets"
266,I,"Of linking gold, are avenues of sleep:"
267,I,But see how gable ends and parapets
268,I,In gradual beauty and significance
269,I,Emerge!  And did you hear
270,I,"That little twitter-and-cheep,"
271,I,Breaking inordinately loud and clear
272,I,"On this still, spectral, exquisite atmosphere?"
273,I,'Tis a first nest at matins!  And behold
274,I,A rakehell cat--how furtive and acold!
275,I,A spent witch homing from some infamous dance--
276,I,"Obscene, quick-trotting, see her tip and fade"
277,I,Through shadowy railings into a pit of shade!
278,I,"And lo! a little wind and shy,"
279,I,"The smell of ships (that earnest of romance),"
280,I,"A sense of space and water, and thereby"
281,I,A lamplit bridge ouching the troubled sky.
282,I,"And look, O look! a tangle of silver gleams"
283,I,"And dusky lights, our River and all his dreams,"
284,I,His dreams of a dead past that cannot die!
285,I,
286,I,"What miracle is happening in the air,"
287,I,Charging the very texture of the gray
288,I,With something luminous and rare?
289,I,"The night goes out like an ill-parcelled fire,"
290,I,"And, as one lights a candle, it is day."
291,I,The extinguisher that fain would strut for spire
292,I,On the formal little church is not yet green
293,I,"Across the water: but the house-tops nigher,"
294,I,"The corner-lines, the chimneys--look how clean,"
295,I,"How new, how naked!  See the batch of boats,"
296,I,"Here at the stairs, washed in the fresh-sprung beam!"
297,I,"And those are barges that were goblin floats,"
298,I,"Black, hag-steered, fraught with devilry and dream!"
299,I,"And in the piles the water frolics clear,"
300,I,"The ripples into loose rings wander and flee,"
301,I,And we--we can behold that could but hear
302,I,The ancient River singing as he goes
303,I,New-mailed in morning to the ancient Sea.
304,I,The gas burns lank and jaded in its glass:
305,I,"The old Ruffian soon shall yawn himself awake,"
306,I,"And light his pipe, and shoulder his tools, and take"
307,I,His hobnailed way to work!
308,I,Let us too pass:
309,I,Through these long blindfold rows
310,I,"Of casements staring blind to right and left,"
311,I,Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece
312,I,Of life in death's own likeness--Life bereft
313,I,Of living looks as by the Great Release
314,I,"(Perchance of shadow-shapes from shadow-shows),"
315,I,Whose upshot all men know yet no man knows.
316,I,
317,I,"Reach upon reach of burial--so they feel,"
318,I,These colonies of dreams!  And as we steal
319,I,"Homeward together, but for the buxom breeze"
320,I,"That frolics at our heel,"
321,I,"Greeting the town with news of the summer seas,"
322,I,"We might--thus awed, thus lonely that we are--"
323,I,"Be wandering some depopulated star,"
324,I,"Some world of memories and unbroken graves,"
325,I,So broods the abounding Silence near and far:
326,I,Till even your footfall craves
327,I,Forgiveness of the majesty it braves.

334,II,_Scherzando_
335,II,
336,II,Down through the ancient Strand
337,II,"The Spirit of October, mild and boon"
338,II,"And sauntering, takes his way"
339,II,"This golden end of afternoon,"
340,II,As though the corn stood yellow in all the land
341,II,And the ripe apples dropped to the harvest-moon.
342,II,
343,II,"Lo! the round sun, half down the western slope--"
344,II,Seen as along an unglazed telescope--
345,II,"Lingers and lolls, loth to be done with day:"
346,II,"Gifting the long, lean, lanky street"
347,II,And its abounding confluences of being
348,II,With aspects generous and bland:
349,II,Making a thousand harnesses to shine
350,II,"As with new ore from some enchanted mine,"
351,II,And every horse's coat so full of sheen
352,II,"He looks new-tailored, and every 'bus feels clean,"
353,II,And never a hansom but is worth the feeing;
354,II,And every jeweller within the pale
355,II,Offers a real Arabian Night for sale;
356,II,And even the roar
357,II,Of the strong streams of toil that pause and pour
358,II,Eastward and westward sounds suffused--
359,II,Seems as it were bemused
360,II,"And blurred, and like the speech"
361,II,Of lazy seas upon a lotus-eating beach--
362,II,"With this enchanted lustrousness,"
363,II,"This mellow magic, that (as a man's caress"
364,II,Brings back to some faded face beloved before
365,II,A heavenly shadow of the grace it wore
366,II,Ere the poor eyes were minded to beseech)
367,II,"Old things transfigures, and you hail and bless"
368,II,Their looks of long-lapsed loveliness once more;
369,II,Till the sedate and mannered elegance
370,II,Of Clement's is all tinctured with romance;
371,II,"The while the fanciful, formal, finicking charm"
372,II,"Of Bride's, that madrigal in stone,"
373,II,Glows flushed and warm
374,II,And beauteous with a beauty not its own;
375,II,And the high majesty of Paul's
376,II,"Uplifts a voice of living light, and calls--"
377,II,Calls to his millions to behold and see
378,II,How goodly this his London Town can be!
379,II,
380,II,For earth and sky and air
381,II,"Are golden everywhere,"
382,II,And golden with a gold so suave and fine
383,II,The looking on it lifts the heart like wine.
384,II,Trafalgar Square
385,II,(The fountains volleying golden glaze)
386,II,Gleams like an angel-market.  High aloft
387,II,Over his couchant Lions in a haze
388,II,"Shimmering and bland and soft,"
389,II,"A dust of chrysoprase,"
390,II,Our Sailor takes the golden gaze
391,II,"Of the saluting sun, and flames superb"
392,II,As once he flamed it on his ocean round.
393,II,"The dingy dreariness of the picture-place,"
394,II,"Turned very nearly bright,"
395,II,"Takes on a certain dismal grace,"
396,II,And shows not all a scandal to the ground.
397,II,"The very blind man pottering on the kerb,"
398,II,Among the posies and the ostrich feathers
399,II,And the rude voices touched with all the weathers
400,II,"Of all the varying year,"
401,II,Shares in the universal alms of light.
402,II,"The windows, with their fleeting, flickering fires,"
403,II,"The height and spread of frontage shining sheer,"
404,II,"The glistering signs, the rejoicing roofs and spires--"
405,II,"'Tis El Dorado--El Dorado plain,"
406,II,"The Golden City!  And when a girl goes by,"
407,II,"Look! as she turns her glancing head,"
408,II,A call of gold is floated from her ear!
409,II,"Golden, all golden!  In a golden glory,"
410,II,"Long lapsing down a golden coasted sky,"
411,II,The day not dies but seems
412,II,"Dispersed in wafts and drifts of gold, and shed"
413,II,Upon a past of golden song and story
414,II,And memories of gold and golden dreams.

421,III,_Largo e mesto_
422,III,
423,III,"Out of the poisonous East,"
424,III,"Over a continent of blight,"
425,III,Like a maleficent Influence released
426,III,"From the most squalid cellarage of hell,"
427,III,"The Wind-Fiend, the abominable--"
428,III,The hangman wind that tortures temper and light--
429,III,"Comes slouching, sullen and obscene,"
430,III,Hard on the skirts of the embittered night:
431,III,And in a cloud unclean
432,III,"Of excremental humours, roused to strife"
433,III,By the operation of some ruinous change
434,III,Wherever his evil mandate run and range
435,III,"Into a dire intensity of life,"
436,III,"A craftsman at his bench, he settles down"
437,III,To the grim job of throttling London Town.
438,III,
439,III,"And, by a jealous lightlessness beset"
440,III,That might have oppressed the dragons of old time
441,III,"Crunching and groping in the abysmal slime,"
442,III,"A cave of cut-throat thoughts and villainous dreams,"
443,III,"Hag-rid and crying with cold and dirt and wet,"
444,III,"The afflicted city, prone from mark to mark"
445,III,"In shameful occultation, seems"
446,III,"A nightmare labyrinthine, dim and drifting,"
447,III,With wavering gulfs and antic heights and shifting
448,III,Rent in the stuff of a material dark
449,III,"Wherein the lamplight, scattered and sick and pale,"
450,III,Shows like the leper's living blotch of bale:
451,III,Uncoiling monstrous into street on street
452,III,"Paven with perils, teeming with mischance,"
453,III,"Where man and beast go blindfold and in dread,"
454,III,Working with oaths and threats and faltering feet
455,III,Somewhither in the hideousness ahead;
456,III,Working through wicked airs and deadly dews
457,III,That make the laden robber grin askance
458,III,"At the good places in his black romance,"
459,III,"And the poor, loitering harlot rather choose"
460,III,Go pinched and pined to bed
461,III,Than lurk and shiver and curse her wretched way

474,III,With her blaspheming cargo reels and rides:
475,III,"The while his children, the brave ships,"
476,III,No more adventurous and fair

520,IV,Down Piccadilly dance and murmur and gleam
521,IV,In genial wave on wave and gyre on gyre?
522,IV,Why does that nymph unparalleled splash and churn
523,IV,The wealth of her enchanted urn
524,IV,"Till, over-billowing all between"
525,IV,"Her cheerful margents grey and living green,"
526,IV,"It floats and wanders, glittering and fleeing,"
527,IV,An estuary of the joy of being?
528,IV,Why should the buxom leafage of the Park

530,IV,"--As if my paramour, my bride of brides,"

547,IV,"These with their hopes, with their sweet secrets those,"
548,IV,"But all desirable and frankly fair,"
549,IV,"As each were keeping some most prosperous tryst,"
550,IV,And in the knowledge went imparadised.
551,IV,"For look! a magical influence everywhere,"
552,IV,Look how the liberal and transfiguring air
553,IV,"Washes this inn of memorable meetings,"
554,IV,"This centre of ravishments and gracious greetings,"
555,IV,"Till, through its jocund loveliness of length"
556,IV,"A tidal-race of lust from shore to shore,"
557,IV,"A brimming reach of beauty met with strength,"

569,IV,"Still reigns and triumphs, as he hath triumphed and reigned"
570,IV,Since in the dim blue dawn of time
571,IV,"The universal ebb-and-flow began,"
572,IV,"To sound his ancient music, and prevails"
573,IV,By the persuasion of his mighty rhyme
574,IV,Here in this radiant and immortal street

580,IV,"As once in Eden's prodigal bowers befell,"
581,IV,"To share his shameless, elemental mirth"
582,IV,"In one great act of faith, while deep and strong,"
583,IV,"Incomparably nerved and cheered,"
584,IV,The enormous heart of London joys to beat
585,IV,"To the measures of his rough, majestic song:"
