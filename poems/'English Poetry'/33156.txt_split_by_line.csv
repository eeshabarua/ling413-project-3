41,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
42,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
43,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Between the period of George Herbert, and that of Edward Young, some"
44,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,singular changes had taken place in British poetry as well as in British
45,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"manners, politics, and religion. There had passed over the land the"
46,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"thunderstorm of the Puritanic Revolt, which had first clouded and then"
47,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"cleared, for a season, the intellectual and moral horizon. The effect of"
48,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"this on poetry was, for such fugitive though felicitous hymns as those of"
49,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Herbert, to substitute the epic unities and grand choral harmonies of"
50,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Milton. Then came the Restoration--the Apotheosis of falsehood; including
51,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"in that term false principles, false politics, and false taste. Britain"
52,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"became the degraded slave of France, at once in laws and in literature."
53,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Dryden, indeed, maintained, in some measure, the character and the taste"
54,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of his nation, but he stood almost alone. To him succeeded Addison and"
55,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Pope, both gifted but both timid men, whose genius, great as it was,"
56,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"never, or rarely, ventured on original and daring flights, and who seemed"
57,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"always to be haunted by the fear of French criticism. Pope, especially,"
58,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,lent all his influence to confirm and seal the power of a foreign code of
59,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"literary laws; and so general and so deep was the submission, that it is"
60,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to us one of the strongest proofs of Edward Young's genius, that he"
61,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"ventured, in that polished but powerless era, to uplift a native voice of"
62,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"song, and not to uplift it in vain; for, if he did not absolutely make a"
63,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"revolution, or found a school, he yet established himself, and left his"
64,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,poetry as a glorious precedent to all who should afterwards be so hardy
65,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"as to ""go and do likewise."""
66,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
67,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Edward Young was born in June 1681 (according to some, two years"
68,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"earlier), in the village of Upham, Hampshire. His father was rector of"
69,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the parish, and is represented as a man of great learning and abilities."
70,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"He was the author of some volumes of sermons, and, on account of their"
71,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"merit, and through the patronage of Lord Bradford, he was appointed"
72,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"chaplain to King William, and Dean of Salisbury. He died in 1705, in the"
73,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"sixty-third year of his age, and Bishop Burnet, the Sunday after his"
74,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"decease, pronounced a glowing panegyric on his character, in a funeral"
75,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,sermon delivered in the Cathedral.
76,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
77,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Edward was sent to Winchester School, and thence to Oxford, where he"
78,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"obtained a law fellowship in All-Souls College, and afterwards took"
79,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"successively the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Civil Law, besides"
80,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"obtaining a fellowship in 1706. When the Codrington Library was founded,"
81,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"he was appointed to deliver the Latin oration. It was published, but met"
82,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"with a frigid reception, being full of conceits and puerilities, and the"
83,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,author wisely omitted it from his collected works. Little else is known
84,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,of his career at College. He is said to have blended fits of study with
85,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"frequent dissipation. When he relaxed, it was in the company of the"
86,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"infamous Duke of Wharton, who patronised, corrupted, and laughed at him."
87,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"When he studied, he would shut his windows, create around him an"
88,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"artificial night, and make it more hideous by piling up skulls,"
89,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"cross-bones, and instruments of death in his room. His talent was then as"
90,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,well known as his eccentricity. Tindal the sceptic bore a striking
91,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"testimony to this when he said, ""The other boys I can always answer,"
92,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"because I always know where they have their arguments, which I have read"
93,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,a hundred times; but that fellow Young is continually pestering me with
94,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"something of his own."""
95,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
96,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,He seems to have been nearly thirty ere he began to tune that lyre which
97,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,was afterwards to thrill with vibrations of song so powerful and
98,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,melodious. His first choice of a subject was characteristic of the lofty
99,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and ambitious tone of his genius: it was, ""The Last Day."" This poem was"
100,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"written in 1710, although not given to the world till 1713. He had"
101,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"previously, in 1712, published an epistle to Lord Lansdown, which"
102,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"displayed little of his peculiar power, but was at once feeble and"
103,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,pretentious. Young became afterwards heartily ashamed of it. In the same
104,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"year that ""The Last Day"" appeared, he prefixed to Addison's ""Cato"" a copy"
105,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of verses of no great merit. Shortly after, he issued a poem entitled,"
106,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""The Force of Religion; or, Vanquished Love:"" it was founded on the story"
107,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of Lady Jane Grey and her husband, and was ushered in by a flaming"
108,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"dedication to the Countess of Salisbury. On the death of the Queen, in"
109,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"1714, he published a panegyric in verse on her memory, and inscribed it"
110,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,to Addison. In these days flattery to princes and nobles was a commodity
111,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,almost essential to poetry--a tawdry court dress which every poet was
112,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,obliged to put on for the nonce; and not even Dryden has excelled Young
113,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,in the violent unlikeness and unsparing incense of his adulations. It is
114,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"satisfactory to remember that, on cool reflection, he cancelled the most"
115,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,of those unworthy effusions; although he continued to the last very much
116,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of a courtier, as the dedications to the ""Night Thoughts"" sufficiently"
117,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,prove. He is supposed about the year 1717 to have visited Ireland in
118,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,company with Wharton.
119,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
120,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In 1719 his tragedy of ""Busiris"" appeared on the stage, and had"
121,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"considerable success. He sold the copyright afterwards to B. Lintot, for"
122,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"£84, which, for a first play by an author previously unknown, was thought"
123,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"a large sum. ""Busiris"" is a play of that solemnly pompous and intensely"
124,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"artificial school, the race of which has been long since gathered to its"
125,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,fathers. It is conceived and written in Ercles' vein;[1] and Nat Lee
126,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"himself, in his wild ranting plays, has scarcely surpassed the torrents"
127,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,of bombastic nonsense which issue from the lips of Myron. Immediately
128,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"after ""Busiris"" he published his Paraphrase on part of the Book of Job, a"
129,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,production scarcely worthy either of Young or of the sublime original.
130,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"The descriptions in that grandest of all poems, which are so rich and"
131,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"massive as to press almost on the sense, are more fairly represented in"
132,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,our common prose translation than in the poetical paraphrase of Young. We
133,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"are far, however, from being opposed, with some critics, to the principle"
134,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,of paraphrasing Scripture. We admire to enthusiasm many of the Scottish
135,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"paraphrases, some of Byron's and Moore's Hebrew Melodies, and Croly's"
136,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,_Scenes from Scripture_; and should like to see all the poetry of the
137,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Bible versified by some competent hand.
138,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
139,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In 1721 appeared ""The Revenge,"" by far the most powerful of his"
140,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,tragedies. Its great fault lies in its likeness to Othello: its great
141,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"praise is, that, though it imitates and challenges comparison with that"
142,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Shakspearean masterpiece, it has not been utterly sunk and eclipsed"
143,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"before it. As a play, we think it decidedly second-rate; the plot is not"
144,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"artistically managed, and the means by which jealousy is excited in the"
145,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"mind of Alonzo, are a very poor and shabby copy of those in Shakspeare."
146,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Zanga has been called a ""vulgar caricature of Iago;"" he is so in part,"
147,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"perhaps, but Young has abated the vulgarity of the imitation by endowing"
148,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his hero with a wild and native vein of poetry. Iago is a subtler, colder"
149,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"fiend than Zanga, and indulges more in sneers and in smut than in"
150,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,declamation. Zanga's speeches exhaust the rhetoric of revenge. Iago has
151,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"nothing but intellect, wit, and malignity. Zanga has an imagination"
152,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"worthy of the hot and lion-peopled land of his birth. Iago, after his"
153,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"detection, sinks into obstinate silence; he stiffens into the statue of a"
154,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"demon. Zanga dies, using lofty imagery."
155,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
156,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Indeed, ""The Revenge"" owes all its interest to the flames of poetic"
157,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,genius which burst out at every pore of its otherwise coarse and copied
158,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"structure. It was dedicated to Wharton, with whom Young continued to be"
159,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,intimate; whom he taught to speak good Latin _in the space of six weeks_;
160,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,and who lent him money to reimburse him for the expenses of an
161,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,unsuccessful attempt to get into Parliament. This was in 1721; the place
162,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"was Cirencester. The election, however, was contested, and fortunately,"
163,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"perhaps, both for Young and the world, he was unsuccessful. Had he gained"
164,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the seat, he had very probably,"
165,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
166,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Though born for the universe, narrow'd his mind,"
167,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"And to party given up what was meant for mankind;"""
168,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
169,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and what comparison between a series of eloquent, forgotten speeches, and"
170,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the starry, ever-burning splendours of the ""Night Thoughts""?"
171,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
172,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"His disappointment in this attempt, coupled, probably, with remorse for"
173,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the follies and vices of a misspent youth, seems to have soured Young,"
174,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,and ripened him to the point when satire becomes the unavoidable
175,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,expression of the irritated yet unsubdued spirit. In 1725 appeared the
176,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"first part of his ""Universal Passion;"" the rest came out in successive"
177,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"satires between that and 1728, when they were collected and published,"
178,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"along with a somewhat querulous preface, in which he hints that he had"
179,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"not found poetry very favourable to preferment. He gained, however, £3000"
180,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"by these poems, of which, according to Spence, £2000 was contributed by"
181,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the Duke of Grafton, who did not, however, regret the price. His"
182,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"inscriptions of the several satires were, as usual at the time, stuffed"
183,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"with fulsome praise of such men as Dorset, Dodington, Campton, and Sir"
184,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Robert Walpole, all of whom appreciated and rewarded the compliments. We"
185,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"reserve our criticism on these remarkable productions till afterwards,"
186,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"noticing only at present, that they were published _before_ the satires"
187,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of Pope, and that they became instantly popular."
188,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
189,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"As if to propitiate the Nemesis, who always stands behind the chariot of"
190,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the popular writer, Young next issued two of the poorest of all his"
191,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"unequal productions. The first of these, entitled ""The Instalment,"" was"
192,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"addressed to Sir Robert Walpole, and is, perhaps, although the word be a"
193,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"wide one, the most nonsensical and trashy _lie in verse_ ever addressed"
194,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to a prime minister. The second is an ""Ode to Ocean,"" a compound of"
195,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"doggrel and stilted dulness--which, indeed, any sailor of education might"
196,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"have composed, if ""half-seas-over."""
197,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
198,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"At length, sick of dissipation, of the stage, of bad odes, and good"
199,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"satires, Young determined to become wise, and enter into orders. An"
200,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"irresistible current had long been carrying him on, with many a"
201,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"convulsive recalcitration on his part, to this determination. That great"
202,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"intellect and heart, over which, already, the shadow of the ""Night"
203,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thoughts"" was beginning to gather, could not be satisfied with the"
204,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"society of ""peers, poets,"" and demireps; with the applause of sweltering"
205,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,crowds collected in theatres; or with the ebullitions of its own giant
206,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"spleen, in the shape of epigrammatic satires. The world, which once"
207,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"seemed to his eye so fresh and fair, had withered gradually to a"
208,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"skeleton, with sockets for eyes, with eternal baldness for hair, with a"
209,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""stench instead of a sweet savour, and burning instead of beauty."" He"
210,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,resolved to proclaim the particulars of this painful yet blessed
211,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"disenchantment to the ends of the earth, and to all classes of mankind."
212,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"And for this purpose, he first of all mounted the pulpit, and then began"
213,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,to wield what was even then the mightier engine of the press. He was no
214,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"novice when he entered the ministry. Would that we had more who, like"
215,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Young, do not go up by a mechanical ladder, and the mere force of custom,"
216,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to the pulpit, but who come down upon it from long and vain wanderings"
217,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"elsewhere, and with a conviction, as the result of mature experience,"
218,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"that God there still desires to dwell, and that it constitutes even yet a"
219,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"pinnacle of prospect, and power, and promise! Thus came Herbert, and"
220,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Chalmers, and Foster, to their real work as ministers of the gospel. It"
221,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"is not a boy, but a Boanerges-ministry that introduces the Word with most"
222,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,effect to a gainsaying world. Young was full forty-seven--mature in
223,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"years, in acquirements, in experience, and in reputation--when he began"
224,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to publish the ""News that it is well."" Like the eminent men we have just"
225,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"mentioned, and like others whom we might mention, his motives in entering"
226,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,the Church have been calumniated. He has been compared to a lady
227,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"disappointed in love, taking the veil; and, rather inconsistently with"
228,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"this figure, to a sated sensualist becoming an anchorite. How can both be"
229,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"true? If Young was disappointed, how could he be sated? and if sated, how"
230,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"could he be chagrined by the want of satisfaction? The fact is, that such"
231,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"men as Young, Chalmers, Herbert, and Foster, are altogether superior to"
232,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"common standards of judgment, and must be tried by their peers. All had"
233,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"their own share of the disgusts and dissatisfactions connected with life,"
234,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and all felt them keenly. But all had a deeper reason still--a reason, we"
235,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"grant, probably stirred by circumstances into action, for renouncing the"
236,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"empty arena of this world's honours and wealth, and devoting themselves"
237,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,to a higher and nobler purpose. They all saw into the hollowness of
238,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"society, into the misery of the human heart; and felt that the gospel"
239,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"alone could fill that aching void, and satisfy those dreary cravings."
240,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hence, Herbert quitted the pleasures of a court; Chalmers dropped his"
241,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,air-pump and his telescope; Foster resigned his philosophic speculations;
242,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and Young shook off the blandishments of peers, and forgot the claps of"
243,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"multitudes, to proclaim the glad tidings to perishing sinners; and verily"
244,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"all, in different measures, had their reward."
245,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
246,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In April 1728 he was appointed chaplain to George II. His tragedy, ""The"
247,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Brothers,"" which had been in rehearsal, was prudently withdrawn. It is a"
248,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"play superior to ""Busiris,"" but very much inferior to ""The Revenge."" Full"
249,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of passion and poetry, of startling scenes, and vivid images, its subject"
250,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"is unpleasing, and the various perplexities of the plot are not skilfully"
251,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,disentangled.
252,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
253,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In the same year he published ""A True Estimate of Human Life,"" written"
254,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"with force and ingenuity; and a long and very loyal sermon, preached"
255,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"before the House of Commons, on the Martyrdom of Charles I. It was"
256,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"entitled, ""An Apology for Princes; or, the Reverence due to Governments."""
257,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
258,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hitherto Young had lived on the proceeds of his fellowship, and on"
259,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"presents from Wharton, who, at his death, too, left him a pension. He"
260,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"became now, however, very naturally anxious for promotion in that new"
261,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"sphere on which he had entered, and was compelled, _proh pudor_! to lay"
262,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his case before Mrs Howard, the favourite mistress of George II.--that"
263,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"identical ""good Howard,"" who figures so curiously in the famous scene"
264,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"between Jeanie Deans and Queen Caroline. The fact of the application, as"
265,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"well as the terms of the letter he wrote her, renders this the most"
266,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"humiliating incident in all Young's history. In 1730, he published"

274,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"speculations and anecdotes about his residence and labours there, to"
275,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Bulwer's _Student_. He was a powerful preacher. His sermons seem to have
276,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"been striking in thought, rich in image, intensely practical in tendency,"
277,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and were delivered with great animation and effect. It is told, that on"
278,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"one occasion, while preaching at St James's before the Court and His"
279,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Majesty, on some subject of transcendent importance, and not being able"
280,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to command the attention or awaken the feelings of his audience, he at"
281,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"length threw himself back into the pulpit, and burst into tears. That was"
282,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"itself a sermon! The figure of this weeping Titan, who could have rent"
283,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"rocks and severed mountains, but who had failed in breaking the hearts of"
284,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"any of his courtly hearers, is one of the most affecting in the annals of"
285,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"pulpit oratory. Alas! what preacher who has ever aimed at Young's object,"
286,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"has not been at times tempted to assume Young's attitude, and to shed"
287,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Young's bitter and burning tears? ""Who hath believed our report, and to"

290,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In 1731, Young, at the mature age of fifty, married the Lady Elizabeth"
291,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lee, daughter of the Earl of Lichfield, and widow of Colonel Lee. This"
292,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"marriage sprung out of his father's acquaintance with Lady Ann Wharton,"
293,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"who was co-heiress of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley in Oxfordshire, and seems"
294,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,to have been very happy. He next published another of those stupid odes
295,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"by which he seemed predestined to disgrace his genius, entitled ""A Sea"

302,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"story, was ridiculing Milton's allegory of ""Death and Sin,"" when our hero"
303,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,struck in with the extempore epigram:--
304,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
305,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,"

308,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"We cannot see very much wit in this epigram, even in that best shape"
309,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,which we have now given it; but it was not inappropriate to the lean
310,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"denier, who sought to empty everything of the important element--its God;"
311,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to leave the universe, like himself, a grinning skeleton, and to smile in"
312,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,ghastly sympathy over the completed ruin. We fancy we see the two gifted
313,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"men, the one the representative of the scepticism of France, the other,"
314,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of the belief of England, meeting and conversing together. Voltaire is"
315,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"not much in advance of thirty; Young is fifty, and more. Voltaire's face"
316,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"is worn with premature thought and inordinate laughter; Young's, though"
317,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"older, bears a warmer and more sanguine flush. Voltaire has the"
318,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,insincerest of smiles playing constantly over his face like the light of
319,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"an aurora borealis; Young's countenance is grave, settled, open, and"
320,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"serene, as the radiance of an autumn sunset. In Voltaire's eye you see"
321,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the future ""Candide"" laughing down in its depths, while on Young's brow"
322,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"lies the dim and magnificent promise of the ""Night Thoughts."" After"

328,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"By his wife Young had one son, Frederick. He does not seem to have been a"

330,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his death refused to see him, although he ultimately sent him his"
331,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"forgiveness, and made him his heir. But no son of illustrious father has"
332,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,ever had harder measure dealt him. It has been generally supposed that he
333,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"was the Lorenzo of the ""Night Thoughts,"" a poem published when Frederick"
334,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"was only eight years of age, and when he could scarcely have even thought"

338,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"The Poet's life, during the first ten years of his rectorship at Welwyn,"
339,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"flowed on in an even tenor. He was regular in his conduct, happy in his"
340,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"family, diligent in his pastoral duties, and easy in his fortune. His"
341,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,preaching was popular and useful. His studies were principally connected
342,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"with his own profession, and yielded him a growing satisfaction. An"
343,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"anonymous writer in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1782, who seems to"
344,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"have been intimate with him, thus describes him:--""The dignity of a great"
345,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and good mind appeared in all his actions, and in all his words. He"
346,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,conversed on religious subjects with the cheerfulness of virtue; his
347,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,piety was undebased by gloom or enthusiasm; he was regular in the
348,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"performance of all its duties, both in public and in private. In his"
349,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,domestic character he was amiable as he was venerable in the Christian.
350,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,His politeness was such as I never saw equalled: it was invariable to his
351,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,superiors in rank; to his equals and to his inferiors it differed only in
352,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,degrees of elegance. I never heard him speak with roughness to the
353,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,meanest servant. In conversation upon lively subjects he had a brilliancy
354,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,of wit which was peculiar to himself; I know not how to describe it but
355,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,by saying that it was both heightened and softened by the amiable
356,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"qualities of his soul. I have seen him ill and in pain, yet the serenity"
357,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,of his mind remained unruffled. I never heard a peevish expression fall
358,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"from his lips."" Few of his brilliancies are preserved, since,"
359,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"unfortunately, he had no Boswell attached to his heels. But one or two of"
360,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,the sayings that have floated down to us are singularly characteristic.
361,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"On one very stormy night Young went out to his garden, and remained some"
362,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"time. When he returned, one expressed wonder why he had stayed so long in"
363,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"such an evening. ""Oh,"" he replied, ""it is a very fine night; _the Lord is"
364,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"abroad_."" He was very fond of a garden, and inscribed on the wall of his"
365,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"summer-house the words, _Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei_"
366,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"(Walking in the garden, they heard the voice of God). He had also erected"
367,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"a dial with the inscription, _Eheu fugaces!_ which, he said with a smile"
368,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to Mr Langton, ""was sadly verified, for by the next morning my dial had"
369,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"been carried off."" Though sometimes melancholy, he was disposed to"
370,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"encourage mirth in others, and established an assembly and bowling-green"
371,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,in his parish.
372,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
373,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"And had this been all--had Young continued to pursue such an even,"
374,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,equable course--he had been by this time well-nigh forgotten; for we do
375,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,not think that either his satires or plays would of themselves have
376,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,preserved his name. But it was decreed that grief should co-operate with
377,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,disappointment in unfolding the full riches of his mind. Antæus was
378,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,strongest when he touched the ground. Job was never so eloquent till he
379,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"was prostrated on his dunghill. And, in order to be able to write the"
380,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Night Thoughts,"" Young must be plunged in the deepest gloom of"
381,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"affliction--""Thrice flew the shaft, and thrice his peace was slain."" In"
382,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"1736, a daughter of his wife, by a former husband, died. This was Mrs"
383,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Temple--the Narcissa of his great poem. Her disease was a lingering one.
384,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Young accompanied her to Lyons, where she died, and where her remains"
385,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"were brutally denied sepulture, as the dust of a Protestant. Her husband,"
386,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Mr Temple, or Philander, died four years later; and in 1741, Young's"
387,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"wife, or Lucia, also expired. He now felt himself alone, and blasted in"
388,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,his solitude. But his grief did not sink into sullen inactivity. He made
389,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"it oracular, and distilled his tears into song. The ""Night Thoughts"" were"
390,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"immediately commenced, and published between 1742 and 1744. This"
391,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"marvellous poem was all composed either at night, or when riding on"
392,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"horseback--an exercise, by the way, which gives a sense of mastery and"
393,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"confidence, stirs the blood, elevates the animal spirits, and has been"
394,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,felt by many to be eminently favourable to thought and mental
395,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"composition. It inspired, we know, such men as Burns, Byron, Shelley, and"
396,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Delta. We love to think of Young riding through the green lanes of his
397,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"parish, and cooing out to himself his plaintive minstrelsies. We love"
398,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"better still to watch his lonely lamp shining at midnight, like a star,"
399,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"through the darkness, and seeming to answer the far signal of those"
400,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,mightier luminaries which are burning above in the Great Bear and
401,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Orion--the poet the while now dipping his pen to indite his ardent
402,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"immortalities--now leaning his head on his widowed arm, and surrendering"
403,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,himself to paroxysms of uncontrollable anguish--and now looking out upon
404,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the Night as the ""Lord is abroad"" on the wings of the tempest, or as He"
405,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,is silently shining out his name in suns and galaxies--those unwearied

407,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
408,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In 1745, Young wrote ""Reflections on the Public Situation of the"
409,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Kingdom""--a production which made no impression at the time, and is now"
410,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,entirely forgotten. He did not include it in the collection of his works.
411,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In 1753, the tragedy of ""The Brothers,"" which had lain past for thirty"
412,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"years, was produced on the stage. Young gave the profits of the play, and"
413,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"several hundreds from his own pocket, amounting to a thousand pounds in"
414,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"all, to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel--an act which"
415,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,surely balances the stories usually told of his love of money and thirst
416,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,for preferment.

418,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"His next work was, ""The Centaur not Fabulous, in Six Letters to a"
419,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Friend."" Its subjects were, the infidelity and licentiousness of that"
420,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"age. It is a pity that this book has fallen into oblivion, as it is a"
421,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"very rich and powerful piece of writing. It is full of clear, sharp,"
422,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"sententious truth. Its style palpitates with energy, and glitters with"
423,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"poetic image. We wish we saw it reprinted in a cheap form; for, although"
424,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"infidelity and pleasure have both materially changed their phases, there"
425,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"is much in Young's little work that has an imperishable application, and"
426,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,that would be even yet eminently useful. The character of Altamont is
427,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,supposed to represent Lord Euston--a nobleman notorious for his vices.
428,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"The age in which Young's lot was cast was characterised by a low,"
429,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"sneering scepticism, and his earnest and awful letters were treated with"
430,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"ridicule. Many pronounced him mad, others whispered about dotage. _Now_,"
431,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the book seems replete with wisdom, and burning almost with prophetic"
432,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,fire.
433,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
434,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Young, in fact, was not generally appreciated during his lifetime. Tried"
435,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"by the Boileau and Pope standard, his writings were pronounced turgid,"
436,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"strained, and extravagant. Even Warburton, who should have known better,"
437,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"passed a severe judgment on the ""Night Thoughts."" He had, however, his"
438,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"warm admirers, prominent among whom was the amiable and learned Joseph"
439,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Warton. He dedicated to Young his ""Essay on Pope""--an essay containing"
440,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,the first sober and discriminating estimate of that most artificial of
441,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"true poets, and with the opinions expressed in which Young is supposed to"
442,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"have coincided; for, although he admired, and too often imitated, Pope's"
443,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"brilliant point and antithesis, he was aware of far higher models, and"
444,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"found Homer, Milton, and Job far more congenial companions in his"
445,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"studious midnights. In 1758, he published a short and in nowise"
446,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"remarkable sermon, preached before the King at Kensington."
447,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
448,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Richardson, the novelist, was one of Young's greatest friends. Their"
449,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,views on moral and religious subjects were identical; and in gravity of
450,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"tone, and severity of genius, they resembled each other--Richardson being"
451,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"a duller Young, and Young a more elastic and brilliant Richardson."
452,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Although both lived in a most depraved age, neither catered to its"
453,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"tastes. To Richardson, Young addressed, in 1759, a letter on Original"
454,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Composition, which betrays no symptoms of senility, but is full of"
455,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"vigorous and striking remark. In 1762, when upwards of eighty, he wrote"
456,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his last and worst poem. It is entitled ""Resignation,"" and requires, on"
457,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the part of the reader, considerable exercise of that grace. It has very"
458,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"little of Young's peculiar power, and is chiefly filled with weak and"
459,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"toothless abuse of his old acquaintance Voltaire. It was written, it"
460,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"appears, at the instance of Mrs Boscawen--the widow of the Admiral--who,"
461,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"having found consolation from the ""Night Thoughts,"" visited Young, and"
462,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,was still more captivated by his conversation.
463,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
464,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"During the latter years of his life, he is said to have fallen too much"
465,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"under the dominion of his housekeeper, Mrs Hallowes, the widow of a"
466,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"clergyman, who is reported to have ruled him with a rod of iron. Ere his"
467,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"death he revised his printed works, and gave charges in his will that all"
468,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his MSS. should be burned. He applied, when past eighty, to Archbishop"
469,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Secker for promotion, and was appointed Clerk of the Closet to the"
470,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Princess-Dowager of Wales. In April 1765, at the age of eighty-four, he"
471,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,breathed his last. He had been previously unable to perform duty for
472,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"three or four years, but retained his faculties to the last. He left his"
473,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"property principally to his son, who was found by Johnson and Boswell, in"
474,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"1781, residing at Welwyn, and cherishing the memory of his father."
475,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
476,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Young was unquestionably a neglected man. Out of all sight the greatest
477,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"genius then connected with the ministry of the Church of England, he"
478,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,never mounted one step higher than the rectorship his own college had
479,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,conferred on him. Many reasons have been assigned for this. Some say that
480,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"it was because he had attached himself to the side of Frederick, Prince"
481,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of Wales, and had preached an obnoxious sermon at St James's; others,"
482,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,that it was because he had received a pension through Sir Robert Walpole.
483,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,We think that the real cause lay in the vulgar and senseless prejudice
484,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"which prevailed then, and in some measure prevails still, against a"
485,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"literary divine, as if he were a hybrid, or ""centaur, not fabulous."" Let"
486,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,us not blame that age so long as we remember the burning shame reflected
487,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,on ours by the fact that the gifted and high-charactered author of
488,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"_Salathiel_, and _Paris_ in 1815, is still only the rector of St"
489,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Stephen's, Walbrook, while many younger men, who in comparison with him"
490,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"are of little mark, have reached the episcopal bench. Probably Young felt"
491,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"himself consoled for his bad success, by the knowledge that his name and"
492,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"great poem had travelled to foreign lands, and that Madame Klopstock was"
493,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"wondering--good, simple soul!--that her husband's idol and her own, had"
494,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,not been made Archbishop of Canterbury.
495,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
496,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Very little beyond what we have mentioned has been left on record about
497,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his private habits and manners. It was his custom, when well pleased with"
498,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"a passage in the course of his reading, to double down the leaf--when"
499,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"particularly gratified, to mark it by two folds; and some favourite"
500,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"works, such as _The Rambler_, had so many of these marks of approbation"
501,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"that they would not shut. On one occasion, in replying to Tonson and"
502,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lintot, who were both candidates for printing one of his works, he"
503,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"misdirected the letters; and when Lintot opened his, he found it"
504,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"begun--""Bernard Lintot is so great a scoundrel,"" &c. Young was proverbial"
505,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"for absence of mind, and sometimes forgot whether he had dined or not."
506,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Yet in Welwyn his mode of life was rather systematic. He rose early, made"
507,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his domestics join him in morning prayer, read little, ate and drank"
508,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"moderately, walked much in his churchyard, and, in general, retired to"
509,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,rest punctually at eight evening. His son told Dr Johnson that he was
510,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"cheerful in company, but gloomy when alone, and that he never fully"
511,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"recovered his spirits after his wife's death. Mr Jones, his curate, has"
512,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"confirmed this statement, although the gossipping and heartless tone of"
513,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,his letters about such a man cannot be too strongly condemned. Young was
514,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"subject to fits of inspiration, which stupid people confounded with"
515,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"madness. At times his poetry rushed upon him like a whirlwind, and caught"
516,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,him up
517,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
518,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Like swift Ezekiel, by his lock of hair""--"
519,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
520,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and when he came down he seemed weak, panting, and powerless. Mrs"
521,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Boscawen and others describe his conversation as still more remarkable
522,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"than his writings, although occasionally disfigured by conceits and bad"
523,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,puns.
524,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
525,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
526,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"We come now to speak of his genius, especially as manifested in the"
527,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Night Thoughts."" The subject of this wonderful strain was one which, in"
528,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"its novelty, dignity, and depth, challenged the very highest exercise of"
529,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,the very highest faculties; and had Young risen to the full height of his
530,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"great argument, he had become the greatest of all poets. This we by no"
531,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"means affirm he did; but we do assert, that many of the aspects of his"
532,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"magnificent theme have been fully and eloquently expressed by him, and"
533,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,that some of his passages are unsurpassed in the language of men.
534,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
535,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"The poem demands a brief critical consideration as to its _season_, its"
536,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"_argument_, its _imagery_, its _style_, its _versification_, its"
537,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"_comparative place_ and _merit_, and, lastly, the _genius_ of its author."
538,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"First, of its _season_--the Night--and the use to which he turns it."
539,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Night had never before found a worthy laureate. Its profound silence, as"
540,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,if it were listening to catch the accents of some supernal voice--the
541,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,shadowy grandeur and mysterious newness it gives to objects on the
542,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,earth--the divine hues into which its moon discolours all things--the
543,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"deep sleep which then falleth upon men, and changes the world into one"
544,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,hushed grave--the supernatural shapes and mystic sounds which have been
545,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"supposed to walk in its darkness, or to echo through its depths--the"
546,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"voices scarce less solemn, which often break its silence, of howling"
547,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"winds, and wailing rivers, and shrieking tempests, and groaning thunders,"
548,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and the wild cries of human misery and despair--and last and highest, its"
549,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"withdrawal of the bright mist and mantle of day from the starry universe,"
550,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and the pomp with which it unrols and exhibits its ""great map"" of suns"
551,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and systems--its silvery satellites--its meek planets, each shining in"
552,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,its own degree of reflected splendour--its oceans of original and
553,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"ever-burning fire called suns--its comets, those serpents of the sky,"
554,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,trailing their vast volumes of deadly glory through the shuddering
555,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"system--its fantastic and magnificent shapes and collocations of stars,"
556,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the constellations--its firmaments rising above firmaments, like rounds"
557,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"in a ladder, at the top of which is the throne of God--and those two"
558,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"awful arms into which its Milky Way diverges, and which seem uplifted to"
559,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"heaven in silent prayer, or in some deep and dread protest,--all these"
560,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,elements of interest and grandeur had existed from the beginning of the
561,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"world in Night, and yet had never, till Young arose, awakened any"
562,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,consecutive and lofty strain of poetic adoration. Many beautiful and many
563,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,sublime sentiments had been uttered by poets about particular features of
564,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Night, but there had been no attempt to represent it as a whole. There"
565,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"were many single thoughts, but no large and sounding Hymn. The views of"
566,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the Pagan poets about astronomy were, of course, warped by the absurd"
567,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"systems of their day; and this served to damp their fire, and to render"
568,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,their poetic tributes rather fantastic than truly powerful. Even Dante
569,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and Milton are somewhat embarrassed by the Ptolemaic system, although it"
570,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,proves the strength of their genius that they have extracted so much
571,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"poetry from it. But before Young arose,"
572,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
573,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night;"
574,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"God said, Let Newton be, and all was light;"""
575,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
576,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,and he has set the Newtonian system to his own martial music.
577,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
578,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,We are far from contending that Young has exhausted the poetry of the
579,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,theme. Since his time the telescopes of Herschell and Lord Rosse have
580,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"been turned to the skies, and have greatly extended the size and"
581,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,splendour of that vast midnight Apparition--the starry scheme. Our recent
582,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"poets have availed themselves of these discoveries, as witness the"
583,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"eloquent rhapsodies about the stars by Bailey, A. Smith, and Bigg. And"
584,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"there is even yet room for another great poem on the subject, entitled"
585,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Night,"" were the author come. But Young deserves praise for the"
586,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,following things:--
587,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
588,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"_1st_, He has nobly sung the magnitude and unutterable glory of the"
589,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"starry hosts. His soul kindles, triumphs, exults under the midnight"
590,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,canopy. As the Tartar horse when led forth from his stable to the free
591,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"steppes and free firmament of the desert, bounds, prances, and caracoles"
592,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"for joy, so does Young, in the last part of his poem. Escaped from dark"
593,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and mournful contemplations on Man, Death, Infidelity, and Earth's"
594,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""melancholy map,"" he sees the stars like bright milestones on the way to"
595,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"heaven, and his spirit is glad within him, and tumultuous is the"
596,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"grandeur, and fierce and rapid the torrent, of his song."
597,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
598,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"_2dly_, He has brought out, better than any other poet, the religion of"
599,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the stars. ""Night,"" says Isaac Taylor, ""has three daughters, Atheism,"
600,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Superstition, and Religion."" Following out this fine thought, we see"
601,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Atheism looking up with impudent eye, brazen brow, and naked figure, to"
602,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the midnight sky, as if it were only a huge toy-shop of glittering"
603,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"gew-gaws; Superstition shrouding herself in a black mantle, and falling"
604,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"down prostrate and trembling before these innumerable fires, as if they"
605,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,were the eyes of an infinite enemy; while Religion turns aloft her
606,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"humble, yet fearless form, her tear-trembling yet radiant visage, and"
607,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"murmurs, ""My Father made them all."" Young, we need scarcely say, finds in"
608,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the nocturnal heavens lessons neither of Atheism nor of Superstition, but"
609,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of Religion, and reads in the face of Old Night her divine origin, the"
610,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"witness she bears to the existence of God, her dependence upon her"
611,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Author, and her subordination to His purposes. He had magnified, as"
612,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Newton himself could not so eloquently have done, the extent of the"
613,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,universe; and yet his loyalty to Scripture compels him to intimate that
614,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"this system, so far from being God, or infinite, or, strictly speaking,"
615,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Divine, is to perish and pass away. One look from the angry Judge, one"
616,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"uplifting of His rod, and its voluminous waves of glory, like another Red"
617,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Sea, are to be dried up, that the people of God may pass through and"
618,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"enter on the land of the real Immortality, the ""inheritance"
619,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"incorruptible, undefiled, and that shall never fade away."" We refer our"
620,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"readers to that most eloquent picture, near the beginning of the Ninth"
621,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Night, of the Last Day. We once heard a lecturer on chemistry close a"
622,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"superb description of the material universe, with the words, ""And it is"
623,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to shine on for ever."" We thought of the words of Peter, ""All these"
624,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"things shall be dissolved."" And then we fancied an invisible animalcule"
625,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"inhabiting one of the mountain peaks of a furnace, looking abroad from"
626,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"one of its surging spires, and saying, ""This wondrous blaze is to burn"
627,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"for ever,"" and yet, ere a few hours have passed, the flame is sunk in"
628,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"ashes, and the animalcule is gone. So the Heavens shall pass away with a"
629,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"great noise. They shall perish, but Thou God remainest; nay, thou Man,"
630,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"too, art destined to survive this splendid nursery, and to enter on new"
631,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Heavens and a new Earth!
632,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
633,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"The argument of the ""Night Thoughts"" may be stated in general to be as"
634,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,follows:--It is to shew the vanity of man as mortal; to inculcate the
635,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"lowness, misery, and madness of the sensual life; to prove the"
636,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"superiority of the Christian to the man of the world, both in life and in"
637,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"death, and the worthlessness of merely human friendship; to argue, from"
638,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"nature and reason, the truth of man's immortality; to shew the"
639,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"reasonableness of religion, and to inculcate the necessity of a divine"
640,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"revelation, and of a propitiatory sacrifice. That this argument is always"
641,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"steadily pursued, or logically pled, we do not pretend. It has its"
642,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,flaws;--we particularly demur to many of its proofs of the immortality of
643,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the soul, which seem to us very feeble and unsatisfactory; but, taking it"
644,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"as a whole, it is unanswerable and overwhelming. Its links are of red-hot"
645,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,iron; its appeals to the conscience are irresistible; and he who can read
646,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"it with indifference, or rise from it unimpressed and unawed, must be"
647,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,either something worse or something less than man. It needs not to be
648,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"surrounded by panegyrics. Convinced, purified, elevated, saved Souls, are"
649,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the gems in its crown. We are inclined to believe that, in this aspect,"
650,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"the ""Night Thoughts"" has effected more practical good than the ""Paradise"
651,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lost."" The latter is a splendid picture; the former a searching, powerful"
652,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"sermon. Now, although pictures with a strong moral contained in them have"
653,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"often done much good, they want the point, emphasis, and effect of great"
654,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,sermons. You may gaze long enough at Milton with no feeling besides
655,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,admiration of his genius; but in every page Young is grappling with your
656,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"conscience, and saying, ""Don't look at me, but look to yourself."" Foster,"
657,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"one of the greatest of our practical reasoners on religion, has been much"
658,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"indebted to Young, whom he resembled also in the sombre grandeur of his"
659,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,genius.
660,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
661,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Young's imagery is distinguished by its richness, originality, and"
662,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,exceeding boldness. It was verily a new thing in that timid and
663,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"conventional age. Like the imagery of all highest poets, it is selected"
664,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"alike from low and from lofty objects, from the gay and the gloomy, from"
665,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,stars and dunghills. His mind moves along through the poem like a great
666,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"wheel, now descending and now ascending, easy to criticise, but"
667,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"impossible to resist. You may question the taste of many of his figures,"
668,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,such as that of the Sun--
669,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
670,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Rude drunkard, rising rosy from the main;"""
671,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
672,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"or when he speaks of God as the ""Great Philanthropist;"" or calls the moon"
673,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""the Portland of the skies;"" but you always feel yourself in contact with"
674,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"a new, native, overflowing mind--with a mind which has read nature"
675,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"through man, and man through nature. There is to Young's genius nothing"
676,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"common or unclean in the material universe. _All_ points up to God, and"
677,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"looks round significantly to man. His imagination has no limits, and,"
678,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"when he is thoroughly roused, like the war-horse of Job, the ""glory of"
679,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"his nostrils is terrible;"" it is the fury of power, the revel of"
680,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"conscious wealth, the ""prancing of a mighty one;"" not the dance of mere"
681,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"fancy, but the earnestness and energy of one treading a winepress alone."
682,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"In proof of this, we appeal to his splendid passages on the miserable"
683,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"state of Man, on Dreams, on Procrastination, to one half of his defence"
684,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"of Immortality, and to the whole of his descant on the Stars. This every"
685,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"one feels is power--barbarous power, if you will--savage, mismanaged"
686,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"power, if you please to call it so; but power that moves, agitates,"
687,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"overwhelms, hurries you away like an infant on the stream of a cataract."
688,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
689,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"His diction is, on the whole, a worthy medium to his thought. It has been"
690,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"somewhat spoiled by intimacy with Pope's writings, and is often vitiated"
691,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"with antithesis, an excess in which was the mode of the day. Now and"
692,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"then, too, he is coarse and violent, to vulgarity, in his expressions."
693,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"But whenever he forgets Pope, and remembers Milton--or, still more, when"
694,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,he becomes swallowed up in the magnitude of his theme--his language is
695,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"easy, powerful, and magnificent. It never, as Mitford asserts, is"
696,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"unsupported by a ""corresponding grandeur of thought."" There is more"
697,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"thought in Young's poem--more sharp, clear, original reflection--more of"
698,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,that matter which leaves stings behind it--more moral sublimity--than in
699,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"any poem which has appeared since in Britain. Mitford says, that ""every"
700,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"image is amplified to the utmost."" Some images unquestionably are; but"
701,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"amplification is not a prevailing vice of Young's style--it is, indeed,"
702,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,inconsistent with that pointed intensity which is his general manner; and
703,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"how comes it, if he be a diffuse and wordy writer, that his pages"
704,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"literally sparkle with maxims, and that, next perhaps to Shakspeare, no"
705,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,poet has been so often quoted? What the same writer means by Young
706,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""fatiguing the reader's mind,"" we can understand; since it is fatiguing"
707,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to look long at the sun, or to follow the grand parabola of the eagle's"
708,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"flight; but how he should ""dissatisfy"" the mind of any intelligent and"
709,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"candid reader, is to us extraordinary. It is not true that the work has"
710,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""a uniformity of subject."" Its tone is rather uniform, but its subjects"
711,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,are as varied as they are important. They are--Man--the World--Ambition--
712,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Pleasure--Infidelity--Immortality--Death--Judgment--Heaven--Hell--the
713,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Stars--Eternity. Mr Mitford compares Young to Seneca; as if a cold
714,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"collector of stiff maxims, and a poet whose wisdom was set in enthusiasm"
715,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"as in a ring of fire, were proper subjects of comparison. And it is"
716,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"strange how he should introduce the name of Cicero, as if he were not"
717,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"that very master of amplification, and of over-copiousness of expression,"
718,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"which Mitford _imagines_ Young to be! ""No selection--no discreet and"
719,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"graceful reservation--no experienced taste!""--in other words, he was not"
720,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Pope or Campbell, but Edward Young--not a middle-sized, neat, and"
721,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"well-dressed citizen, but a hirsute giant--not an elegant _parterre_, but"
722,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"an American forest, bowing only to the old Tempests, and offering up a"
723,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"holocaust of native wealth and glory, not to Man, but to God."
724,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
725,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,His versification is a more vulnerable point. We grant at once that it
726,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"is, as a whole, rugged and imperfect, and that, while his single lines"
727,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"are often exceedingly melodious, he rarely reaches, any more than Pope or"
728,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Johnson, those long and linked swells of sound--"
729,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
730,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Floating, mingling, interweaving,"
731,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Rising, sinking, and receiving"
732,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Each from each, while each is giving"

734,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Each, the pails of gold, the living"
735,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Current through the air is heaving""--"
736,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
737,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"which Goëthe has so beautifully, although unintentionally, described in"
738,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"these words, applied by him to the elements of Nature; and which he and"
739,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Milton, and Spenser, and Coleridge, and Shelley, have so admirably"
740,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,exemplified in their verse. Young's style is too broken and sententious
741,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,to permit the miracles of melody which are found in some of our poets.
742,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,Yet he has a few passages which approach even to this high standard. Take
743,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,the following:--
744,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
745,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Look nature through, 'tis revolution all;"
746,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"All change, no death. Day follows night, and night"
747,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,The dying day; stars rise and set and rise;
748,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Earth takes th' example. See the summer gay,"
749,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"With her green chaplet, and ambrosial flowers,"
750,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Droops into pallid autumn; winter gray,"

794,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"very often criticised now-a-days. Young, however, seems to us to have"
795,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,been capable of even higher things than he has effected in his works. He
796,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"was one of those prolific, fiery, inexhaustible souls, who never seem"
797,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"nearing a limit, or dreaming of a shallow in their genius; who, often"
798,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"stumbling over precipices or precipitated into pools, rise stronger, and"
799,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"rush on faster, from their misadventures; who, sometimes stopping too"
800,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"long to moralise on fungi and ant-hillocks, are all the better breathed"
801,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to career through endless forests, and to take Alps and Andes at a flying"

807,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"His taste was not equal certainly to his other faculties, and he was"
808,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"guilty of occasional extravagances, and stumbled not unfrequently over"
809,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,the brink of the bathos; but his genius possessed the following
810,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"qualities:--It was original. He had read much, but he copies little, and"
811,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,never slavishly. His mind looks at everything--at skulls and
812,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,stars--through a medium of its own. It was subtle as well as native and
813,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"strong, and in its movements it is broadly based on a vigorous intellect."
814,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"It was progressive and prophetic in its spirit, and many of our recent"

816,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to be found in Young--ay, in the mere spray his mind threw off on its way"
817,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"to an ulterior result. Think of this, for instance, and then remember a"

819,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
820,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Man's grief is but his grandeur in disguise;"

822,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
823,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Finally, his genius, with all its compass and daring, was reverent and"
824,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"religious. He gloried in the universe; he swam, as it were, and circled"
825,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"like a strong swimmer, in that starry sea; but he bent before the Cross,"
826,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"and, instead of looking up, looked down, and cried out, ""God be merciful"

828,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,
829,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"We commend his masterpiece to readers, partly, indeed, for its power,--a"
830,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"power that has hitherto rather been felt than acknowledged, rather"
831,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"admired in silence than analysed; but principally because, like ""The"
832,ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.,"Temple"" of Herbert, it is holy ground. The author, amid his elaborate"

1192,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Misfortune, like a creditor severe,"

1194,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"She makes a scourge of past prosperity,"
1195,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"To sting thee more, and double thy distress."

1205,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"A call to duty, not discharge from care;"
1206,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"And should alarm us, full as much as woes;"
1207,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Awake us to their cause, and consequence;"
1208,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"O'er our scann'd conduct give a jealous eye,"
1209,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"And make us tremble, weigh'd with our desert;"
1210,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Awe nature's tumult, and chastise her joys,"
1211,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Lest, while we clasp, we kill them; nay, invert"

1232,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Smiled at thy well-concerted scheme, and beckon'd"
1233,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"The worm to riot on that rose so red,"
1234,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Unfaded ere it fell; one moment's prey!                            360
1235,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Man's foresight is conditionally wise;

1250,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Where is to-morrow? In another world.
1251,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,For numbers this is certain; the reverse
1252,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Is sure to none; and yet on this perhaps,"
1253,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"This peradventure, infamous for lies,"
1254,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"As on a rock of adamant, we build                                  380"
1255,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Our mountain hopes; spin out eternal schemes,"
1256,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"As we the fatal sisters could out-spin,"

1258,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Not even Philander had bespoke his shroud;
1259,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Nor had he cause; a warning was denied.                            385
1260,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"How many fall as sudden, not as safe!"
1261,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"As sudden, though for years admonish'd home."

1280,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"At least, their own; their future selves applaud;"
1281,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!
1282,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Time lodged in their own hands is folly's vails;[5]

1297,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Resolves; and re-resolves; then dies the same.
1298,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,And why? Because he thinks himself immortal.
1299,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"All men think all men mortal, but themselves:"
1300,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Themselves, when some alarming shock of fate"
1301,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread;
1302,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,"
1303,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Soon close; where pass'd the shaft, no trace is found."
1304,SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,As from the wing no scar the sky retains;                          430

2109,NARCISSA.,"The mazy dance, and hears their matchless strain;"
2110,NARCISSA.,"A strain for gods, denied to mortal ear."
2111,NARCISSA.,"Transmit it heard, thou silver Queen of Heaven!"
2112,NARCISSA.,"What title, or what name, endears thee most?"
2113,NARCISSA.,Cynthia! Cyllene! Phoebe!--or dost hear
2114,NARCISSA.,"With higher gust, fair P----d of the skies?"
2115,NARCISSA.,"Is that the soft enchantment calls thee down,"
2116,NARCISSA.,More powerful than of old Circean charm?
2117,NARCISSA.,Come; but from heavenly banquets with thee bring
2118,NARCISSA.,"The soul of song, and whisper in my ear                             50"
2119,NARCISSA.,The theft divine; or in propitious dreams
2120,NARCISSA.,(For dreams are thine) transfuse it through the breast              52
2121,NARCISSA.,Of thy first votary--but not thy last;
2122,NARCISSA.,"If, like thy namesake, thou art ever kind."
2123,NARCISSA.,And kind thou wilt be; kind on such a theme;
2124,NARCISSA.,"A theme so like thee, a quite lunar theme,"
2125,NARCISSA.,"Soft, modest, melancholy, female, fair!"
2126,NARCISSA.,"A theme that rose all pale, and told my soul,"
2127,NARCISSA.,'Twas Night; on her fond hopes perpetual night;
2128,NARCISSA.,"A night which struck a damp, a deadlier damp,                       60"
2129,NARCISSA.,Than that which smote me from Philander's tomb.
2130,NARCISSA.,"Narcissa[12] follows, ere his tomb is closed."
2131,NARCISSA.,Woes cluster; rare are solitary woes;
2132,NARCISSA.,"They love a train, they tread each other's heel;"
2133,NARCISSA.,"Her death invades his mournful right, and claims"
2134,NARCISSA.,The grief that started from my lids for him:
2135,NARCISSA.,"Seizes the faithless, alienated tear,"
2136,NARCISSA.,"Or shares it, ere it falls. So frequent Death,"
2137,NARCISSA.,"Sorrow he more than causes, he confounds;"
2138,NARCISSA.,"For human sighs his rival strokes contend,                          70"
2139,NARCISSA.,"And make distress, distraction. Oh, Philander!"
2140,NARCISSA.,What was thy fate? A double fate to me;
2141,NARCISSA.,"Portent, and pain! a menace, and a blow!"
2142,NARCISSA.,"Like the black raven hovering o'er my peace,"
2143,NARCISSA.,"Not less a bird of omen, than of prey."
2144,NARCISSA.,It call'd Narcissa long before her hour;
2145,NARCISSA.,"It call'd her tender soul, by break of bliss,"
2146,NARCISSA.,"From the first blossom, from the buds of joy;"
2147,NARCISSA.,Those few our noxious fate unblasted leaves
2148,NARCISSA.,In this inclement clime of human life.                              80
2149,NARCISSA.,Sweet harmonist! and beautiful as sweet!
2150,NARCISSA.,And young as beautiful! and soft as young!
2151,NARCISSA.,And gay as soft! and innocent as gay!
2152,NARCISSA.,And happy (if aught happy here) as good!
2153,NARCISSA.,For fortune fond had built her nest on high.                        85
2154,NARCISSA.,"Like birds quite exquisite of note and plume,"
2155,NARCISSA.,"Transfix'd by fate (who loves a lofty mark),"
2156,NARCISSA.,"How from the summit of the grove she fell,"
2157,NARCISSA.,And left it unharmonious! all its charms
2158,NARCISSA.,Extinguish'd in the wonders of her song!
2159,NARCISSA.,"Her song still vibrates in my ravish'd ear,"
2160,NARCISSA.,"Still melting there, and with voluptuous pain"
2161,NARCISSA.,(O to forget her!) thrilling through my heart!                      93
2162,NARCISSA.,"Song, beauty, youth, love, virtue, joy! this group"
2163,NARCISSA.,"Of bright ideas, flowers of paradise,"
2164,NARCISSA.,"As yet unforfeit! in one blaze we bind,"
2165,NARCISSA.,"Kneel, and present it to the skies; as all"
2166,NARCISSA.,We guess of heaven: and these were all her own.
2167,NARCISSA.,And she was mine; and I was--was!--most blest!--
2168,NARCISSA.,Gay title of the deepest misery!                                   100
2169,NARCISSA.,"As bodies grow more ponderous, robb'd of life;"
2170,NARCISSA.,"Good lost weighs more in grief, than gain'd, in joy."
2171,NARCISSA.,"Like blossom'd trees o'erturn'd by vernal storm,"
2172,NARCISSA.,Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay;
2173,NARCISSA.,"And if in death still lovely, lovelier there;"
2174,NARCISSA.,Far lovelier! pity swells the tide of love.
2175,NARCISSA.,And will not the severe excuse a sigh?
2176,NARCISSA.,Scorn the proud man that is ashamed to weep;
2177,NARCISSA.,"Our tears indulged, indeed deserve our shame."
2178,NARCISSA.,Ye that e'er lost an angel! pity me.                               110
2179,NARCISSA.,"Soon as the lustre languish'd in her eye,"
2180,NARCISSA.,Dawning a dimmer day on human sight;
2181,NARCISSA.,"And on her cheek, the residence of spring,"
2182,NARCISSA.,Pale omen sat; and scatter'd fears around
2183,NARCISSA.,"On all that saw; (and who would cease to gaze,"
2184,NARCISSA.,"That once had seen?) with haste, parental haste,"
2185,NARCISSA.,"I flew, I snatch'd her from the rigid north,"
2186,NARCISSA.,"Her native bed, on which bleak Boreas blew,"
2187,NARCISSA.,And bore her nearer to the sun;[13] the sun                        119
2188,NARCISSA.,"(As if the sun could envy) check'd his beam,"
2189,NARCISSA.,Denied his wonted succour; nor with more
2190,NARCISSA.,"Regret beheld her drooping, than the bells"
2191,NARCISSA.,"Of lilies; fairest lilies, not so fair!"
2192,NARCISSA.,Queen lilies! and ye painted populace!
2193,NARCISSA.,"Who dwell in fields, and lead ambrosial lives;"
2194,NARCISSA.,"In morn and evening dew your beauties bathe,"
2195,NARCISSA.,"And drink the sun; which gives your cheeks to glow,"
2196,NARCISSA.,And out-blush (mine excepted) every fair;
2197,NARCISSA.,"You gladlier grew, ambitious of her hand,"
2198,NARCISSA.,"Which often cropp'd your odours, incense meet                      130"
2199,NARCISSA.,To thought so pure! Ye lovely fugitives!
2200,NARCISSA.,Coeval race with man! for man you smile;
2201,NARCISSA.,Why not smile at him too? You share indeed
2202,NARCISSA.,His sudden pass; but not his constant pain.
2203,NARCISSA.,"So man is made, nought ministers delight,"
2204,NARCISSA.,By what his glowing passions can engage;
2205,NARCISSA.,"And glowing passions, bent on aught below,"
2206,NARCISSA.,"Must, soon or late, with anguish turn the scale;"
2207,NARCISSA.,"And anguish, after rapture, how severe!"
2208,NARCISSA.,"Rapture? Bold man! who tempts the wrath divine,                    140"
2209,NARCISSA.,"By plucking fruit denied to mortal taste,"
2210,NARCISSA.,"While here, presuming on the rights of heaven."
2211,NARCISSA.,"For transport dost thou call on every hour,"
2212,NARCISSA.,Lorenzo? At thy friend's expense be wise;
2213,NARCISSA.,Lean not on earth; 'twill pierce thee to the heart;
2214,NARCISSA.,"A broken reed, at best; but, oft, a spear;"
2215,NARCISSA.,"On its sharp point peace bleeds, and hope expires."
2216,NARCISSA.,"Turn, hopeless thought! turn from her:--thought repell'd"
2217,NARCISSA.,"Resenting rallies, and wakes every woe."
2218,NARCISSA.,Snatch'd ere thy prime! and in thy bridal hour!                    150
2219,NARCISSA.,"And when kind fortune, with thy lover, smiled!                     151"
2220,NARCISSA.,And when high flavour'd thy fresh opening joys!
2221,NARCISSA.,And when blind man pronounced thy bliss complete!
2222,NARCISSA.,And on a foreign shore; where strangers wept!
2223,NARCISSA.,"Strangers to thee; and, more surprising still,"
2224,NARCISSA.,"Strangers to kindness, wept: their eyes let fall"
2225,NARCISSA.,Inhuman tears: strange tears! that trickled down
2226,NARCISSA.,From marble hearts! obdurate tenderness!
2227,NARCISSA.,A tenderness that call'd them more severe;
2228,NARCISSA.,"In spite of nature's soft persuasion, steel'd;                     160"
2229,NARCISSA.,"While nature melted, superstition raved;"
2230,NARCISSA.,That mourn'd the dead; and this denied a grave.
2231,NARCISSA.,Their sighs incensed; sighs foreign to the will!
2232,NARCISSA.,"Their will the tiger suck'd, outraged the storm."
2233,NARCISSA.,For oh! the cursed ungodliness of zeal!
2234,NARCISSA.,"While sinful flesh relented, spirit nursed"
2235,NARCISSA.,"In blind infallibility's embrace,"
2236,NARCISSA.,The sainted spirit petrified the breast;
2237,NARCISSA.,"Denied the charity of dust, to spread"
2238,NARCISSA.,O'er dust! a charity their dogs enjoy.                             170
2239,NARCISSA.,What could I do? what succour? what resource?
2240,NARCISSA.,"With pious sacrilege, a grave I stole;"
2241,NARCISSA.,"With impious piety, that grave I wrong'd;"
2242,NARCISSA.,Short in my duty; coward in my grief!
2243,NARCISSA.,"More like her murderer, than friend, I crept,"
2244,NARCISSA.,"With soft-suspended step, and muffled deep"
2245,NARCISSA.,"In midnight darkness, whisper'd my last sigh."
2246,NARCISSA.,I whisper'd what should echo through their realms;
2247,NARCISSA.,"Nor writ her name, whose tomb should pierce the skies."
2248,NARCISSA.,"Presumptuous fear! How durst I dread her foes,                     180"
2249,NARCISSA.,While nature's loudest dictates I obey'd?
2250,NARCISSA.,"Pardon necessity, bless'd shade! of grief"
2251,NARCISSA.,And indignation rival bursts I pour'd;
2252,NARCISSA.,Half execration mingled with my prayer;
2253,NARCISSA.,"Kindled at man, while I his God adored;                            185"
2254,NARCISSA.,Sore grudged the savage land her sacred dust;
2255,NARCISSA.,Stamp'd the cursed soil; and with humanity
2256,NARCISSA.,(Denied Narcissa) wish'd them all a grave.
2257,NARCISSA.,Glows my resentment into guilt? What guilt
2258,NARCISSA.,Can equal violations of the dead?
2259,NARCISSA.,The dead how sacred! Sacred is the dust
2260,NARCISSA.,"Of this heaven-labour'd form, erect, divine!                       192"
2261,NARCISSA.,"This heaven-assumed majestic robe of earth,"
2262,NARCISSA.,"He deign'd to wear, who hung the vast expanse"
2263,NARCISSA.,"With azure bright, and clothed the sun in gold."
2264,NARCISSA.,When every passion sleeps that can offend;
2265,NARCISSA.,When strikes us every motive that can melt;
2266,NARCISSA.,"When man can wreak his rancour uncontroll'd,"
2267,NARCISSA.,That strongest curb on insult and ill-will;
2268,NARCISSA.,"Then, spleen to dust? the dust of innocence?                       200"
2269,NARCISSA.,An angel's dust?--This Lucifer transcends;
2270,NARCISSA.,"When he contended for the patriarch's bones,"
2271,NARCISSA.,"'Twas not the strife of malice, but of pride;"
2272,NARCISSA.,"The strife of pontiff pride, not pontiff gall."
2273,NARCISSA.,Far less than this is shocking in a race
2274,NARCISSA.,"Most wretched, but from streams of mutual love;"
2275,NARCISSA.,"And uncreated, but for love divine;"
2276,NARCISSA.,"And, but for love divine, this moment, lost,"
2277,NARCISSA.,"By fate resorb'd, and sunk in endless night."
2278,NARCISSA.,Man hard of heart to man! of horrid things                         210
2279,NARCISSA.,"Most horrid! 'mid stupendous, highly strange!"
2280,NARCISSA.,Yet oft his courtesies are smoother wrongs;
2281,NARCISSA.,"Pride brandishes the favours He confers,"
2282,NARCISSA.,And contumelious his humanity:
2283,NARCISSA.,"What then his vengeance? Hear it not, ye stars!"
2284,NARCISSA.,"And thou, pale moon! turn paler at the sound;"
2285,NARCISSA.,"Man is to man the sorest, surest ill."
2286,NARCISSA.,A previous blast foretells the rising storm;
2287,NARCISSA.,O'erwhelming turrets threaten ere they fall;                       219
2288,NARCISSA.,Volcanos bellow ere they disembogue;
2289,NARCISSA.,Earth trembles ere her yawning jaws devour;
2290,NARCISSA.,And smoke betrays the wide-consuming fire:
2291,NARCISSA.,"Ruin from man is most conceal'd when near,"
2292,NARCISSA.,And sends the dreadful tidings in the blow.
2293,NARCISSA.,Is this the flight of fancy? Would it were!
2294,NARCISSA.,"Heaven's Sovereign saves all beings, but himself,"
2295,NARCISSA.,"That hideous sight, a naked human heart."
2296,NARCISSA.,Fired is the Muse? And let the Muse be fired:
2297,NARCISSA.,"Who not inflamed, when what he speaks, he feels,"
2298,NARCISSA.,"And in the nerve most tender, in his friends?                      230"
2299,NARCISSA.,Shame to mankind! Philander had his foes;
2300,NARCISSA.,"He felt the truths I sing, and I in him."
2301,NARCISSA.,"But he, nor I, feel more: past ills, Narcissa!"
2302,NARCISSA.,"Are sunk in thee, thou recent wound of heart!"
2303,NARCISSA.,"Which bleeds with other cares, with other pangs;"
2304,NARCISSA.,"Pangs numerous, as the numerous ills that swarm'd"
2305,NARCISSA.,"O'er thy distinguish'd fate, and, clustering there"
2306,NARCISSA.,"Thick as the locusts on the land of Nile,"
2307,NARCISSA.,"Made death more deadly, and more dark the grave."
2308,NARCISSA.,Reflect (if not forgot my touching tale)                           240
2309,NARCISSA.,How was each circumstance with aspics arm'd?
2310,NARCISSA.,"An aspic, each! and all, a hydra woe:"
2311,NARCISSA.,What strong Herculean virtue could suffice?--
2312,NARCISSA.,Or is it virtue to be conquer'd here?
2313,NARCISSA.,This hoary cheek a train of tears bedews;
2314,NARCISSA.,And each tear mourns its own distinct distress;
2315,NARCISSA.,"And each distress, distinctly mourn'd, demands"
2316,NARCISSA.,"Of grief still more, as heighten'd by the whole."
2317,NARCISSA.,A grief like this proprietors excludes:
2318,NARCISSA.,Not friends alone such obsequies deplore;                          250
2319,NARCISSA.,They make mankind the mourner; carry sighs
2320,NARCISSA.,Far as the fatal fame can wing her way;
2321,NARCISSA.,"And turn the gayest thought of gayest age,                         253"
2322,NARCISSA.,"Down their right channel, through the vale of death."
2323,NARCISSA.,"The vale of death! that hush'd Cimmerian vale,"
2324,NARCISSA.,"Where darkness, brooding o'er unfinish'd fates"
2325,NARCISSA.,"With raven wing incumbent, waits the day"
2326,NARCISSA.,(Dread day!) that interdicts all future change!
2327,NARCISSA.,"That subterranean world, that land of ruin!"
2328,NARCISSA.,"Fit walk, Lorenzo, for proud human thought!"
2329,NARCISSA.,"There let my thought expatiate, and explore                        261"
2330,NARCISSA.,"Balsamic truths, and healing sentiments,"
2331,NARCISSA.,"Of all most wanted, and most welcome, here."
2332,NARCISSA.,"For gay Lorenzo's sake, and for thy own,"
2333,NARCISSA.,"My soul! ""the fruits of dying friends survey;"
2334,NARCISSA.,Expose the vain of life; weigh life and death;
2335,NARCISSA.,Give death his eulogy; thy fear subdue;
2336,NARCISSA.,"And labour that first palm of noble minds,"
2337,NARCISSA.,"A manly scorn of terror from the tomb."""
2338,NARCISSA.,This harvest reap from thy Narcissa's grave.                     270
2339,NARCISSA.,As poets feign'd from Ajax' streaming blood
2340,NARCISSA.,"Arose, with grief inscribed, a mournful flower;"
2341,NARCISSA.,Let wisdom blossom from my mortal wound.
2342,NARCISSA.,"And first, of dying friends; what fruit from these?"
2343,NARCISSA.,It brings us more than triple aid; an aid
2344,NARCISSA.,"To chase our thoughtlessness, fear, pride, and guilt."
2345,NARCISSA.,"Our dying friends come o'er us like a cloud,"
2346,NARCISSA.,To damp our brainless ardours; and abate
2347,NARCISSA.,"That glare of life, which often blinds the wise."
2348,NARCISSA.,"Our dying friends are pioneers, to smooth                          280"
2349,NARCISSA.,Our rugged pass to death; to break those bars
2350,NARCISSA.,"Of terror, and abhorrence, nature throws"
2351,NARCISSA.,"Cross our obstructed way; and, thus to make"
2352,NARCISSA.,"Welcome, as safe, our port from every storm."
2353,NARCISSA.,"Each friend by fate snatch'd from us, is a plume"
2354,NARCISSA.,"Pluck'd from the wing of human vanity,"
2355,NARCISSA.,"Which makes us stoop from our aërial heights,                      287"
2356,NARCISSA.,"And, damp'd with omen of our own decease,"
2357,NARCISSA.,"On drooping pinions of ambition lower'd,"
2358,NARCISSA.,"Just skim earth's surface, ere we break it up,"
2359,NARCISSA.,"O'er putrid earth to scratch a little dust,"
2360,NARCISSA.,And save the world a nuisance. Smitten friends
2361,NARCISSA.,Are angels sent on errands full of love;
2362,NARCISSA.,"For us they languish, and for us they die:"
2363,NARCISSA.,"And shall they languish, shall they die, in vain?"
2364,NARCISSA.,"Ungrateful, shall we grieve their hovering shades,"
2365,NARCISSA.,Which wait the revolution in our hearts?
2366,NARCISSA.,Shall we disdain their silent soft address;
2367,NARCISSA.,"Their posthumous advice, and pious prayer?"
2368,NARCISSA.,"Senseless, as herds that graze their hallow'd graves,              300"
2369,NARCISSA.,Tread under foot their agonies and groans;
2370,NARCISSA.,"Frustrate their anguish, and destroy their deaths?"
2371,NARCISSA.,Lorenzo! no; the thought of death indulge;
2372,NARCISSA.,"Give it its wholesome empire! let it reign,"
2373,NARCISSA.,That kind chastiser of thy soul in joy!
2374,NARCISSA.,"Its reign will spread thy glorious conquests far,"
2375,NARCISSA.,And still the tumults of thy ruffled breast:
2376,NARCISSA.,"Auspicious era! golden days, begin!"
2377,NARCISSA.,"The thought of death shall, like a god, inspire."
2378,NARCISSA.,And why not think on death? Is life the theme                      310
2379,NARCISSA.,Of every thought? and wish of every hour?
2380,NARCISSA.,And song of every joy? Surprising truth!
2381,NARCISSA.,The beaten spaniel's fondness not so strange.
2382,NARCISSA.,To wave the numerous ills that seize on life
2383,NARCISSA.,"As their own property, their lawful prey;"
2384,NARCISSA.,"Ere man has measured half his weary stage,"
2385,NARCISSA.,"His luxuries have left him no reserve,"
2386,NARCISSA.,"No maiden relishes, unbroach'd delights;"
2387,NARCISSA.,"On cold served repetitions he subsists,"
2388,NARCISSA.,And in the tasteless present chews the past;                       320
2389,NARCISSA.,"Disgusted chews, and scarce can swallow down.                      321"
2390,NARCISSA.,"Like lavish ancestors, his earlier years"
2391,NARCISSA.,"Have disinherited his future hours,"
2392,NARCISSA.,"Which starve on orts, and glean their former field."
2393,NARCISSA.,"Live ever here, Lorenzo?--shocking thought!"
2394,NARCISSA.,"So shocking, they who wish, disown it too;"
2395,NARCISSA.,Disown from shame what they from folly crave.
2396,NARCISSA.,"Live ever in the womb, nor see the light?"
2397,NARCISSA.,For what live ever here?--With labouring step
2398,NARCISSA.,To tread our former footsteps? pace the round                      330
2399,NARCISSA.,"Eternal? to climb life's worn, heavy wheel,"
2400,NARCISSA.,"Which draws up nothing new? to beat, and beat"
2401,NARCISSA.,The beaten track? to bid each wretched day
2402,NARCISSA.,"The former mock? to surfeit on the same,"
2403,NARCISSA.,And yawn our joys? or thank a misery
2404,NARCISSA.,"For change, though sad? to see what we have seen?"
2405,NARCISSA.,"Hear, till unheard, the same old slabber'd tale?"
2406,NARCISSA.,"To taste the tasted, and at each return"
2407,NARCISSA.,Less tasteful? o'er our palates to decant
2408,NARCISSA.,"Another vintage? strain a flatter year,                            340"
2409,NARCISSA.,"Through loaded vessels, and a laxer tone?"
2410,NARCISSA.,Crazy machines to grind earth's wasted fruits!
2411,NARCISSA.,"Ill-ground, and worse concocted! load, not life!"
2412,NARCISSA.,The rational foul kennels of excess!
2413,NARCISSA.,Still-streaming thoroughfares of dull debauch!
2414,NARCISSA.,"Trembling each gulp, lest death should snatch the bowl."
2415,NARCISSA.,Such of our fine ones is the wish refined!
2416,NARCISSA.,So would they have it: elegant desire!
2417,NARCISSA.,"Why not invite the bellowing stalls, and wilds?"
2418,NARCISSA.,But such examples might their riot awe.                            350
2419,NARCISSA.,"Through want of virtue, that is, want of thought"

2439,NARCISSA.,"Believest thou this, Lorenzo? lend an ear,"
2440,NARCISSA.,"A patient ear, thou'lt blush to disbelieve."
2441,NARCISSA.,"A languid, leaden iteration reigns,"

2444,NARCISSA.,"The same dull note to such as nothing prize,"
2445,NARCISSA.,"But what those seasons, from the teeming earth,"
2446,NARCISSA.,"To doating sense indulge. But nobler minds,"
2447,NARCISSA.,"Which relish fruits unripen'd by the sun,"

2514,NARCISSA.,"""Strange competition!""--True, Lorenzo! strange!"
2515,NARCISSA.,So little life can cast into the scale.
2516,NARCISSA.,Life makes the soul dependent on the dust;

2527,NARCISSA.,"""Is Death then guiltless? How he marks his way"
2528,NARCISSA.,With dreadful waste of what deserves to shine!
2529,NARCISSA.,"Art, genius, fortune, elevated power!"

2534,NARCISSA.,"Death humbles these; more barbarous life, the man."
2535,NARCISSA.,Life is the triumph of our mouldering clay;
2536,NARCISSA.,"Death, of the spirit infinite! divine!"
2537,NARCISSA.,"Death has no dread, but what frail life imparts;"

2549,NARCISSA.,"Lorenzo! blush at terror for a death,"
2550,NARCISSA.,"Which gives thee to repose in festive bowers,"
2551,NARCISSA.,"Where nectars sparkle, angels minister,"
2552,NARCISSA.,"And more than angels share, and raise, and crown,"

2555,NARCISSA.,"Then welcome, Death! thy dreaded harbingers,"
2556,NARCISSA.,"Age and disease; disease, though long my guest;"
2557,NARCISSA.,"That plucks my nerves, those tender strings of life;"
2558,NARCISSA.,"Which, pluck'd a little more, will toll the bell,                  490"
2559,NARCISSA.,That calls my few friends to my funeral;                           491
2560,NARCISSA.,"Where feeble nature drops, perhaps, a tear,"
2561,NARCISSA.,"While reason and religion, better taught,"
2562,NARCISSA.,"Congratulate the dead, and crown his tomb"
2563,NARCISSA.,With wreath triumphant. Death is victory;
2564,NARCISSA.,It binds in chains the raging ills of life:
2565,NARCISSA.,"Lust and ambition, wrath and avarice,"
2566,NARCISSA.,"Dragg'd at his chariot-wheel, applaud his power."
2567,NARCISSA.,"That ills corrosive, cares importunate,"

2573,NARCISSA.,"More than thy balm, O Gilead! heals the wound."
2574,NARCISSA.,"Birth's feeble cry, and death's deep dismal groan,"

2578,NARCISSA.,"Life dies, compared; life lives beyond the grave.                  510"
2579,NARCISSA.,"And feel I, Death! no joy from thought of thee?"

2589,NARCISSA.,"One, in my soul; and one, in her great Sire;"

2592,NARCISSA.,"Though prison'd there, my dust too I reclaim"
2593,NARCISSA.,"(To dust when drop proud nature's proudest spheres),"

2596,NARCISSA.,"Were death denied, to live would not be life;"

2743,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Trembling, at once, with eagerness and age?"
2744,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"With avarice, and convulsions, grasping hard?"
2745,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Grasping at air! for what has earth beside?

2795,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Ah! too conspicuous! it is fix'd on high.
2796,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,On high?--What means my phrensy? I blaspheme;
2797,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Alas! how low! how far beneath the skies!
2798,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The skies it form'd; and now it bleeds for me--                    170
2799,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,But bleeds the balm I want--yet still it bleeds;

2811,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And heaved the mountain from a guilty world.
2812,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"A thousand worlds, so bought, were bought too dear;"
2813,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Sensations new in angels' bosoms rise;
2814,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Suspend their song; and make a pause in bliss.
2815,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"O for their song, to reach my lofty theme!"
2816,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Inspire me, Night! with all thy tuneful spheres;"
2817,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Whilst I with seraphs share seraphic themes,"
2818,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And show to men the dignity of man;                                190

2830,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Still more tremendous, for thy wondrous love!"
2831,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"That arms, with awe more awful, thy commands;"
2832,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And foul transgression dips in sevenfold night;
2833,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How our hearts tremble at thy love immense!
2834,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"In love immense, inviolably just!"
2835,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Thou, rather than thy justice should be stain'd,"

2846,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"What, but the fathomless of thought divine,"
2847,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Could labour such expedient from despair,"
2848,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And rescue both? Both rescue! both exalt!                          220
2849,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Oh, how are both exalted by the deed!"
2850,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The wondrous deed! or shall I call it more?
2851,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A wonder in omnipotence itself!                                    223
2852,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A mystery no less to gods than men!
2853,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Not, thus, our infidels th' Eternal draw,"
2854,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"A God all o'er, consummate, absolute,"
2855,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Full-orb'd, in his whole round of rays complete:"

2865,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Heaven's inexhaustible, exhausted fund,"
2866,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Amazing, and amazed, pour'd forth the price,"
2867,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"All price beyond: though curious to compute,"
2868,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Archangels fail'd to cast the mighty sum:                          240
2869,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Its value vast, ungrasp'd by minds create,"
2870,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"For ever hides, and glows, in the Supreme."
2871,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And was the ransom paid? It was: and paid

2875,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Not such as this; not such as nature makes;
2876,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A midnight nature shudder'd to behold;
2877,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A midnight new! a dread eclipse (without

2881,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Which bow'd His blessed head; o'erwhelm'd His cross;
2882,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Made groan the centre; burst earth's marble womb,"
2883,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"With pangs, strange pangs! deliver'd of her dead?"
2884,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Hell howl'd; and heaven that hour let fall a tear;
2885,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Heaven wept, that men might smile! Heaven bled, that man"

2901,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,He rose! he rose! he burst the bars of death.
2902,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Lift up your heads, ye everlasting gates!"
2903,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And give the King of glory to come in.
2904,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Who is the King of glory? He who left
2905,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"His throne of glory, for the pang of death:"
2906,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Lift up your heads, ye everlasting gates!"
2907,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And give the King of glory to come in.
2908,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Who is the King of glory? He who slew                              280

2917,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,This sum of good to man. Whose nature then
2918,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Took wing, and mounted with him from the tomb!                     290"
2919,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Then, then, I rose; then first humanity                            291"
2920,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Triumphant pass'd the crystal ports of light
2921,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"(Stupendous guest!), and seized eternal youth,"
2922,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Seized in our name. E'er since, 'tis blasphemous"
2923,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,To call man mortal. Man's mortality

2934,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Where, then, my boast of immortality?"
2935,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"I boast it still, though cover'd o'er with guilt;"
2936,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"For guilt, not innocence, his life he pour'd;"
2937,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,'Tis guilt alone can justify his death;

2939,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Relenting guilt in Heaven's indulgent sight.
2940,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"If, sick of folly, I relent; he writes"

3024,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Or holds He furious storms in straiten'd reins,"
3025,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And bids fierce whirlwinds wheel his rapid car?
3026,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,What mean these questions?--Trembling I retract;
3027,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,My prostrate soul adores the present God:
3028,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Praise I a distant deity? He tunes                                 400
3029,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"My voice (if tuned); the nerve, that writes, sustains:"
3030,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Wrapp'd in his being, I resound his praise:"
3031,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"But though past all diffused, without a shore,"
3032,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"His essence; local is his throne (as meet),"
3033,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,To gather the dispersed (as standards call
3034,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"The listed from afar): to fix a point,"
3035,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"A central point, collective of his sons,"
3036,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Since finite every nature but his own.
3037,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"The nameless He, whose nod is nature's birth;"
3038,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And nature's shield, the shadow of his hand;                       410"
3039,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Her dissolution, his suspended smile!"
3040,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"The great First-Last! pavilion'd high he sits,"
3041,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"In darkness from excessive splendour borne,"
3042,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"By gods unseen, unless through lustre lost."
3043,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"His glory, to created glory, bright,"
3044,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,As that to central horrors; he looks down
3045,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,On all that soars; and spans immensity.
3046,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Though night unnumber'd worlds unfolds to view,"
3047,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Boundless creation! what art thou? A beam,"
3048,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A mere effluvium of his majesty:                                   420
3049,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And shall an atom of this atom-world
3050,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Mutter, in dust and sin, the theme of heaven?"
3051,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Down to the centre should I send my thought
3052,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Through beds of glittering ore, and glowing gems,"
3053,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Their beggar'd blaze wants lustre for my lay;
3054,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Goes out in darkness: if, on towering wing,"
3055,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,I send it through the boundless vault of stars!                    427
3056,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"The stars, though rich, what dross their gold to thee,"
3057,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Great, good, wise, wonderful, eternal King!"
3058,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"If to those conscious stars thy throne around,"
3059,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Praise ever-pouring, and imbibing bliss;"
3060,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And ask their strain; they want it, more they want,"
3061,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Poor their abundance, humble their sublime,                        433"
3062,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Languid their energy, their ardour cold,"
3063,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Indebted still, their highest rapture burns;"
3064,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Short of its mark, defective, though divine."
3065,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Still more--this theme is man's, and man's alone;"
3066,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Their vast appointments reach it not: they see
3067,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,On earth a bounty not indulged on high;
3068,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And downward look for heaven's superior praise!                    440
3069,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,First-born of ether! high in fields of light!
3070,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"View man, to see the glory of your God!"
3071,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Could angels envy, they had envied here;"
3072,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And some did envy; and the rest, though gods,"
3073,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Yet still gods unredeem'd (their triumphs man,"
3074,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Tempted to weigh the dust against the skies),"
3075,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"They less would feel, though more adorn, my theme."
3076,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,They sung creation (for in that they shared);
3077,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"How rose in melody, that child of love!"
3078,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Creation's great superior, man! is thine;                          450"
3079,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Thine is redemption; they just gave the key:
3080,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"'Tis thine to raise, and eternize, the song;"
3081,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Though human, yet divine; for should not this"
3082,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Raise man o'er man, and kindle seraphs here?"
3083,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Redemption! 'twas creation more sublime;
3084,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Redemption! 'twas the labour of the skies;
3085,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Far more than labour--it was death in heaven.
3086,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A truth so strange! 'twere bold to think it true;
3087,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,If not far bolder still to disbelieve.                             459
3088,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Here pause, and ponder--Was there death in heaven?"
3089,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"What then on earth? on earth, which struck the blow?"
3090,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Who struck it? Who?--O how is man enlarged,                        462"
3091,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Seen through this medium! How the pigmy towers!
3092,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How counterpoised his origin from dust!
3093,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How counterpoised to dust his sad return!
3094,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How voided his vast distance from the skies!
3095,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How near he presses on the seraph's wing!
3096,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Which is the seraph? Which the born of clay?
3097,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"How this demonstrates, through the thickest cloud"
3098,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Of guilt, and clay condensed, the son of heaven!                   470"
3099,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"The double son; the made, and the re-made!"
3100,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And shall heaven's double property be lost?
3101,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Man's double madness only can destroy.
3102,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,To man the bleeding cross has promised all;
3103,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The bleeding cross has sworn eternal grace;
3104,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Who gave his life, what grace shall he deny?"
3105,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"O ye who, from this Rock of Ages, leap,"
3106,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Apostates, plunging headlong in the deep!"
3107,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"What cordial joy, what consolation strong,"
3108,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Whatever winds arise, or billows roll,                             480"
3109,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Our interest in the Master of the storm!
3110,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Cling there, and in wreck'd nature's ruins smile;"
3111,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,While vile apostates tremble in a calm.
3112,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Man! know thyself. All wisdom centres there;
3113,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"To none man seems ignoble, but to man;"
3114,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Angels that grandeur, men o'erlook, admire:"
3115,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"How long shall human nature be their book,"
3116,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Degenerate mortal! and unread by thee?
3117,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The beam dim reason sheds shows wonders there;
3118,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,What high contents! illustrious faculties!                         490
3119,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"But the grand comment, which displays at full"
3120,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Our human height, scarce sever'd from divine,"
3121,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"By heaven composed, was publish'd on the Cross."
3122,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Who looks on that, and sees not in himself"
3123,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"An awful stranger, a terrestrial god?                              495"
3124,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A glorious partner with the Deity
3125,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"In that high attribute, immortal life?"
3126,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"If a god bleeds, he bleeds not for a worm:"
3127,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"I gaze, and, as I gaze, my mounting soul"
3128,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Catches strange fire, eternity! at thee;"
3129,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And drops the world--or rather, more enjoys:"
3130,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How changed the face of nature! how improved!                      502
3131,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"What seem'd a chaos, shines a glorious world,"
3132,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Or, what a world, an Eden; heighten'd all!"
3133,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,It is another scene! another self!
3134,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And still another, as time rolls along;"
3135,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And that a self far more illustrious still.
3136,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Beyond long ages, yet roll'd up in shades"
3137,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Unpierced by bold conjecture's keenest ray,"
3138,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,What evolutions of surprising fate!                                510
3139,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"How nature opens, and receives my soul"
3140,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,In boundless walks of raptured thought! where gods
3141,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Encounter and embrace me! What new births
3142,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Of strange adventure, foreign to the sun,"
3143,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Where what now charms, perhaps, whate'er exists,"
3144,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Old time, and fair creation, are forgot!"
3145,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Is this extravagant? Of man we form
3146,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Extravagant conception, to be just:"
3147,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Conception unconfined wants wings to reach him:
3148,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Beyond its reach, the Godhead only, more.                          520"
3149,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"He, the great Father! kindled at one flame"
3150,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The world of rationals; one spirit pour'd
3151,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,From spirit's awful fountain; pour'd himself
3152,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Through all their souls; but not in equal stream,"
3153,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Profuse, or frugal, of th' inspiring God,"
3154,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,As his wise plan demanded; and when past
3155,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Their various trials, in their various spheres,"
3156,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"If they continue rational, as made,"
3157,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Resorbs them all into himself again;                               529
3158,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"His throne their centre, and his smile their crown."
3159,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Why doubt we, then, the glorious truth to sing,"
3160,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Though yet unsung, as deem'd, perhaps, too bold?"
3161,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Angels are men of a superior kind;
3162,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Angels are men in lighter habit clad,"
3163,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,High o'er celestial mountains wing'd in flight;
3164,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And men are angels, loaded for an hour,"
3165,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Who wade this miry vale, and climb with pain,"
3166,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And slippery step, the bottom of the steep."
3167,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Angels their failings, mortals have their praise;"
3168,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"While here, of corps ethereal, such enroll'd,                      540"
3169,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And summon'd to the glorious standard soon,"
3170,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Which flames eternal crimson through the skies.
3171,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Nor are our brothers thoughtless of their kin,"
3172,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Yet absent; but not absent from their love.
3173,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Michael has fought our battles; Raphael sung
3174,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Our triumphs; Gabriel on our errands flown,"
3175,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Sent by the Sovereign: and are these, O Man!"
3176,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Thy friends, thy warm allies? and thou (shame burn"

3179,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"To wretched man, the goddess, in her left,"
3180,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Holds out this world, and, in her right, the next;"
3181,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Religion! the sole voucher man is man;
3182,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Supporter sole of man above himself;
3183,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Even in this night of frailty, change, and death,"
3184,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,She gives the soul a soul that acts a god.
3185,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Religion! Providence! an After-state!
3186,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Here is firm footing; here is solid rock!
3187,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,This can support us; all is sea besides;
3188,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Sinks under us; bestorms, and then devours.                        560"
3189,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"His hand the good man fastens on the skies,"
3190,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And bids earth roll, nor feels her idle whirl."
3191,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"As when a wretch, from thick polluted air,                       563"
3192,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Darkness, and stench, and suffocating damps,"
3193,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And dungeon horrors, by kind fate, discharged,"

3195,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Surrounds him, and Elysian prospects rise,"
3196,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"His heart exults, his spirits cast their load;"
3197,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"As if new-born, he triumphs in the change;"
3198,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"So joys the soul, when, from inglorious aims,"
3199,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And sordid sweets, from feculence and froth                        571"
3200,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Of ties terrestrial, set at large, she mounts"
3201,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"To reason's region, her own element,"
3202,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Breathes hopes immortal, and affects the skies."
3203,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Religion! thou the soul of happiness;
3204,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And, groaning Calvary, of thee! there shine"
3205,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The noblest truths; there strongest motives sting;
3206,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,There sacred violence assaults the soul;
3207,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"There, nothing but compulsion is forborne."
3208,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Can love allure us? or can terror awe?                             580
3209,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,He weeps!--the falling drop puts out the sun;
3210,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,He sighs--the sigh earth's deep foundation shakes.
3211,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"If in his love so terrible, what then"
3212,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,His wrath inflamed? his tenderness on fire?
3213,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Like soft, smooth oil, outblazing other fires?"
3214,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Can prayer, can praise avert it?--Thou, my all!"
3215,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,My theme! my inspiration! and my crown!

3217,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"My soul's ambition, pleasure, wealth!--my world!"

3313,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"In one illustrious and amazing plan,"
3314,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Thy welfare, nature! and thy God's renown."
3315,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"That touch, with charm celestial, heals the soul"
3316,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Diseased, drives pain from guilt, lights life in death,"
3317,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Turns earth to heaven, to heavenly thrones transforms"
3318,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The ghastly ruins of the mouldering tomb.                          690
3319,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Dost ask me when? When He who died returns;
3320,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Returns, how changed! Where then the man of woe?"
3321,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,In glory's terrors all the Godhead burns;
3322,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And all his courts, exhausted by the tide"

3327,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Of angels new; of angels from the tomb.
3328,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Is this by fancy thrown remote? and rise
3329,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Dark doubts between the promise and event?
3330,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,I send thee not to volumes for thy cure;
3331,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Read nature; nature is a friend to truth;
3332,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Nature is Christian; preaches to mankind;
3333,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And bids dead matter aid us in our creed.
3334,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Hast thou ne'er seen the comet's flaming flight?
3335,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Th' illustrious stranger passing, terror sheds"
3336,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,On gazing nations; from his fiery train

3338,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Through depths of ether; coasts unnumber'd worlds,"
3339,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Of more than solar glory; doubles wide

3342,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Thus, at the destined period, shall return"
3343,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"He, once on earth, who bids the comet blaze:"
3344,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And, with him, all our triumph o'er the tomb."
3345,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Nature is dumb on this important point;
3346,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Or hope precarious in low whisper breathes;
3347,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Faith speaks aloud, distinct; even adders hear;"
3348,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"But turn, and dart into the dark again.                            720"
3349,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death,"
3350,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"To break the shock blind nature cannot shun,"
3351,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And lands thought smoothly on the farther shore.
3352,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Death's terror is the mountain faith removes;
3353,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,That mountain barrier between man and peace.
3354,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,'Tis faith disarms destruction; and absolves
3355,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"From every clamorous charge, the guiltless tomb."
3356,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Why disbelieve? Lorenzo!--""Reason bids,"

3366,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,No; reason re-baptized me when adult;
3367,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Weigh'd true, and false, in her impartial scale;"
3368,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,My heart became the convert of my head;                            740
3369,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And made that choice, which once was but my fate."
3370,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"""On argument alone my faith is built:"""
3371,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Reason pursued is faith; and, unpursued"
3372,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Where proof invites, 'tis reason, then, no more:"
3373,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And such our proof, that, or our faith is right,"
3374,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Or reason lies, and Heaven design'd it wrong:"
3375,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Absolve we this? What, then, is blasphemy?"
3376,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Fond as we are, and justly fond, of faith,"
3377,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Reason, we grant, demands our first regard;"

3379,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Reason the root, fair faith is but the flower;"
3380,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The fading flower shall die; but reason lives
3381,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Immortal, as her Father in the skies."
3382,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"When faith is virtue, reason makes it so."
3383,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Wrong not the Christian; think not reason yours:
3384,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,'Tis reason our great Master holds so dear;
3385,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,'Tis reason's injured rights his wrath resents;
3386,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,'Tis reason's voice obey'd his glories crown;
3387,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"To give lost reason life, he pour'd his own:"
3388,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Believe, and show the reason of a man;                             760"
3389,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Believe, and taste the pleasure of a God;"
3390,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Believe, and look with triumph on the tomb:"
3391,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Through reason's wounds alone thy faith can die;
3392,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Which dying, tenfold terror gives to death,"
3393,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,And dips in venom his twice-mortal sting.
3394,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Learn hence what honours, what loud pæans[16], due               766"
3395,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"To those, who push our antidote aside;"
3396,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Those boasted friends to reason, and to man,"
3397,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Whose fatal love stabs every joy, and leaves"
3398,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Death's terror heighten'd, gnawing on his heart."
3399,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Those pompous sons of reason idolized
3400,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And vilified at once; of reason dead,"
3401,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Then deified, as monarchs were of old;                             773"
3402,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,What conduct plants proud laurels on their brow?
3403,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"While love of truth through all their camp resounds,"
3404,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"They draw pride's curtain o'er the noontide ray,"
3405,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Spike up their inch of reason, on the point"

3413,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"(Nor will they bate of that sublime renown),"
3414,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"As wise as Socrates, might justly stand"
3415,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,The definition of a modern fool.
3416,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,A Christian is the highest style of man:
3417,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"And is there, who the blessed cross wipes off,"
3418,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,As a foul blot from his dishonour'd brow?                          790

3429,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Till one calls him, who varies not his call,"
3430,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"But holds him fast, in chains of darkness bound,"
3431,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"Till nature dies, and judgment sets him free;"
3432,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"A freedom far less welcome than his chain."""
3433,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,But grant man happy; grant him happy long;
3434,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Add to life's highest prize her latest hour;
3435,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"That hour, so late, is nimble in approach,"
3436,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"That, like a post, comes on in full career:"
3437,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,How swift the shuttle flies that weaves thy shroud!
3438,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Where is the fable of thy former years?                            810
3439,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Thrown down the gulf of time; as far from thee
3440,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"As they had ne'er been thine; the day in hand,"

3452,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,"By the great edict, the divine decree,"
3453,THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.,Truth is deposited with man's last hour;

3616,THE RELAPSE.,Darkness has more divinity for me;
3617,THE RELAPSE.,It strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul
3618,THE RELAPSE.,"To settle on herself, our point supreme!                           130"
3619,THE RELAPSE.,There lies our theatre; there sits our judge.
3620,THE RELAPSE.,Darkness the curtain drops o'er life's dull scene;
3621,THE RELAPSE.,'Tis the kind hand of Providence stretch'd out
3622,THE RELAPSE.,"'Twixt man and vanity; 'tis reason's reign,"
3623,THE RELAPSE.,And virtue's too; these tutelary shades
3624,THE RELAPSE.,Are man's asylum from the tainted throng.
3625,THE RELAPSE.,"Night is the good man's friend, and guardian too;"
3626,THE RELAPSE.,"It no less rescues virtue, than inspires."
3627,THE RELAPSE.,"Virtue, for ever frail, as fair, below,"
3628,THE RELAPSE.,"Her tender nature suffers in the crowd,                            140"
3629,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor touches on the world, without a stain:"
3630,THE RELAPSE.,The world's infectious; few bring back at eve.
3631,THE RELAPSE.,"Immaculate, the manners of the morn."
3632,THE RELAPSE.,"Something we thought, is blotted; we resolved,"
3633,THE RELAPSE.,"Is shaken; we renounced, returns again."
3634,THE RELAPSE.,Each salutation may slide in a sin
3635,THE RELAPSE.,"Unthought before, or fix a former flaw."
3636,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor is it strange: light, motion, concourse, noise,"
3637,THE RELAPSE.,"All, scatter us abroad; thought outward-bound,"
3638,THE RELAPSE.,"Neglectful of our home affairs, flies off                          150"
3639,THE RELAPSE.,"In fume and dissipation, quits her charge,"
3640,THE RELAPSE.,And leaves the breast unguarded to the foe.
3641,THE RELAPSE.,"Present example gets within our guard,"
3642,THE RELAPSE.,"And acts with double force, by few repell'd."
3643,THE RELAPSE.,Ambition fires ambition; love of gain
3644,THE RELAPSE.,"Strikes, like a pestilence, from breast to breast;"
3645,THE RELAPSE.,"Riot, pride, perfidy, blue vapours breathe;                        157"
3646,THE RELAPSE.,"And inhumanity is caught from man,"
3647,THE RELAPSE.,"From smiling man. A slight, a single glance,"
3648,THE RELAPSE.,"And shot at random, often has brought home"
3649,THE RELAPSE.,"A sudden fever, to the throbbing heart,"
3650,THE RELAPSE.,"Of envy, rancour, or impure desire."
3651,THE RELAPSE.,"We see, we hear, with peril; safety dwells                         163"
3652,THE RELAPSE.,Remote from multitude; the world's a school
3653,THE RELAPSE.,"Of wrong, and what proficients swarm around!"
3654,THE RELAPSE.,"We must, or imitate, or disapprove;"
3655,THE RELAPSE.,"Must list as their accomplices, or foes;"
3656,THE RELAPSE.,That stains our innocence; this wounds our peace.
3657,THE RELAPSE.,"From nature's birth, hence, wisdom has been smit"
3658,THE RELAPSE.,"With sweet recess, and languish'd for the shade.                   170"
3659,THE RELAPSE.,"This sacred shade, and solitude, what is it?"
3660,THE RELAPSE.,'Tis the felt presence of the Deity.
3661,THE RELAPSE.,Few are the faults we flatter when alone.
3662,THE RELAPSE.,"Vice sinks in her allurements, is ungilt,"
3663,THE RELAPSE.,"And looks, like other objects, black by night."
3664,THE RELAPSE.,By night an atheist half believes a God.
3665,THE RELAPSE.,Night is fair virtue's immemorial friend;
3666,THE RELAPSE.,"The conscious moon, through every distant age,"
3667,THE RELAPSE.,"Has held a lamp to wisdom, and let fall,"
3668,THE RELAPSE.,"On contemplation's eye, her purging ray.                           180"
3669,THE RELAPSE.,"The famed Athenian,[17] he who woo'd from heaven"
3670,THE RELAPSE.,"Philosophy the fair, to dwell with men,"
3671,THE RELAPSE.,"And form their manners, not inflame their pride,"
3672,THE RELAPSE.,"While o'er his head, as fearful to molest"
3673,THE RELAPSE.,"His labouring mind, the stars in silence slide,"
3674,THE RELAPSE.,"And seem all gazing on their future guest,"
3675,THE RELAPSE.,See him soliciting his ardent suit
3676,THE RELAPSE.,"In private audience: all the live-long night,"
3677,THE RELAPSE.,"Rigid in thought, and motionless, he stands;"
3678,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor quits his theme, or posture, till the sun                      190"
3679,THE RELAPSE.,(Rude drunkard rising rosy from the main!)
3680,THE RELAPSE.,"Disturbs his nobler intellectual beam,"
3681,THE RELAPSE.,And gives him to the tumult of the world.
3682,THE RELAPSE.,"Hail, precious moments! stolen from the black waste"
3683,THE RELAPSE.,Of murder'd time! Auspicious midnight! hail!
3684,THE RELAPSE.,"The world excluded, every passion hush'd,"
3685,THE RELAPSE.,"And open'd a calm intercourse with Heaven,"
3686,THE RELAPSE.,"Here the soul sits in council; ponders past,"
3687,THE RELAPSE.,"Predestines future, action; sees, not feels,"
3688,THE RELAPSE.,"Tumultuous life, and reasons with the storm;                       200"
3689,THE RELAPSE.,"All her lies answers, and thinks down her charms."
3690,THE RELAPSE.,What awful joy! what mental liberty!
3691,THE RELAPSE.,I am not pent in darkness; rather say
3692,THE RELAPSE.,(If not too bold) in darkness I'm embower'd.
3693,THE RELAPSE.,Delightful gloom! the clustering thoughts around
3694,THE RELAPSE.,"Spontaneous rise, and blossom in the shade;"
3695,THE RELAPSE.,"But droop by day, and sicken in the sun."
3696,THE RELAPSE.,"Thought borrows light elsewhere; from that first fire,"
3697,THE RELAPSE.,Fountain of animation! whence descends
3698,THE RELAPSE.,"Urania, my celestial guest! who deigns                             210"
3699,THE RELAPSE.,"Nightly to visit me, so mean; and now,"
3700,THE RELAPSE.,"Conscious how needful discipline to man,"
3701,THE RELAPSE.,From pleasing dalliance with the charms of Night
3702,THE RELAPSE.,"My wandering thought recalls, to what excites"
3703,THE RELAPSE.,Far other beat of heart! Narcissa's tomb!
3704,THE RELAPSE.,"Or is it feeble nature calls me back,"
3705,THE RELAPSE.,And breaks my spirit into grief again?
3706,THE RELAPSE.,Is it a Stygian vapour in my blood?
3707,THE RELAPSE.,"A cold, slow puddle, creeping through my veins?"
3708,THE RELAPSE.,Or is it thus with all men?--Thus with all.                        220
3709,THE RELAPSE.,"What are we? how unequal! Now we soar,"
3710,THE RELAPSE.,"And now we sink; to be the same, transcends"
3711,THE RELAPSE.,Our present prowess. Dearly pays the soul
3712,THE RELAPSE.,For lodging ill; too dearly rents her clay.                        224
3713,THE RELAPSE.,"Reason, a baffled counsellor! but adds"
3714,THE RELAPSE.,The blush of weakness to the bane of woe.
3715,THE RELAPSE.,"The noblest spirit fighting her hard fate,"
3716,THE RELAPSE.,"In this damp, dusky region, charged with storms,"
3717,THE RELAPSE.,"But feebly flutters, yet untaught to fly;"
3718,THE RELAPSE.,"Or, flying, short her flight, and sure her fall."
3719,THE RELAPSE.,"Our utmost strength, when down, to rise again;"
3720,THE RELAPSE.,"And not to yield, though beaten, all our praise.                   232"
3721,THE RELAPSE.,'Tis vain to seek in men for more than man.
3722,THE RELAPSE.,"Though proud in promise, big in previous thought,"
3723,THE RELAPSE.,"Experience damps our triumph. I, who late,"
3724,THE RELAPSE.,"Emerging from the shadows of the grave,"
3725,THE RELAPSE.,"Where grief detain'd me prisoner, mounting high,"
3726,THE RELAPSE.,"Threw wide the gates of everlasting day,"
3727,THE RELAPSE.,"And call'd mankind to glory, shook off pain,"
3728,THE RELAPSE.,"Mortality shook off, in ether pure,                                240"
3729,THE RELAPSE.,And struck the stars; now feel my spirits fail;
3730,THE RELAPSE.,"They drop me from the zenith; down I rush,"
3731,THE RELAPSE.,"Like him whom fable fledged[18] with waxen wings,"
3732,THE RELAPSE.,In sorrow drown'd--but not in sorrow lost.
3733,THE RELAPSE.,How wretched is the man who never mourn'd!
3734,THE RELAPSE.,I dive for precious pearl in sorrow's stream:
3735,THE RELAPSE.,Not so the thoughtless man that only grieves;
3736,THE RELAPSE.,"Takes all the torment, and rejects the gain;"
3737,THE RELAPSE.,(Inestimable gain!) and gives Heaven leave
3738,THE RELAPSE.,"To make him but more wretched, not more wise.                      250"
3739,THE RELAPSE.,If wisdom is our lesson (and what else
3740,THE RELAPSE.,"Ennobles man? what else have angels learn'd?),"
3741,THE RELAPSE.,"Grief! more proficients in thy school are made,"
3742,THE RELAPSE.,"Than genius, or proud learning, e'er could boast."
3743,THE RELAPSE.,"Voracious learning, often over-fed,"
3744,THE RELAPSE.,Digests not into sense her motley meal.
3745,THE RELAPSE.,"This book-case, which dark booty almost burst,                     257"
3746,THE RELAPSE.,"This forager on others' wisdom, leaves"
3747,THE RELAPSE.,"Her native farm, her reason, quite untill'd."
3748,THE RELAPSE.,"With mix'd manure she surfeits the rank soil,"
3749,THE RELAPSE.,"Dung'd, but not dress'd; and rich to beggary."
3750,THE RELAPSE.,A pomp untameable of weeds prevails.
3751,THE RELAPSE.,"Her servant's wealth, encumber'd wisdom mourns.                    263"
3752,THE RELAPSE.,"And what says Genius? ""Let the dull be wise."""
3753,THE RELAPSE.,"Genius, too hard for right, can prove it wrong;"
3754,THE RELAPSE.,"And loves to boast, where blush men less inspired."
3755,THE RELAPSE.,It pleads exemption from the laws of sense;
3756,THE RELAPSE.,Considers reason as a leveller;
3757,THE RELAPSE.,And scorns to share a blessing with the crowd.
3758,THE RELAPSE.,"That wise it could be, thinks an ample claim                       270"
3759,THE RELAPSE.,"To glory, and to pleasure gives the rest."
3760,THE RELAPSE.,"Crassus but sleeps, Ardelio is undone."
3761,THE RELAPSE.,"Wisdom less shudders at a fool, than wit."
3762,THE RELAPSE.,"But Wisdom smiles, when humbled mortals weep."
3763,THE RELAPSE.,"When sorrow wounds the breast, as ploughs the glebe,[19]"
3764,THE RELAPSE.,And hearts obdurate feel her softening shower;
3765,THE RELAPSE.,"Her seed celestial, then, glad wisdom sows;"
3766,THE RELAPSE.,Her golden harvest triumphs in the soil.
3767,THE RELAPSE.,"If so, Narcissa[20], welcome my Relapse;"
3768,THE RELAPSE.,"I'll raise a tax on my calamity,                                   280"
3769,THE RELAPSE.,And reap rich compensation from my pain.
3770,THE RELAPSE.,I'll range the plenteous intellectual field;
3771,THE RELAPSE.,And gather every thought of sovereign power
3772,THE RELAPSE.,To chase the moral maladies of man;
3773,THE RELAPSE.,"Thoughts, which may bear transplanting to the skies,"
3774,THE RELAPSE.,Though natives of this coarse penurious soil;
3775,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor wholly wither there, where seraphs sing,"
3776,THE RELAPSE.,"Refined, exalted, not annull'd, in heaven."
3777,THE RELAPSE.,"Reason, the sun that gives them birth, the same"
3778,THE RELAPSE.,"In either clime, though more illustrious there.                    290"
3779,THE RELAPSE.,"These choicely cull'd, and elegantly ranged,                       291"
3780,THE RELAPSE.,Shall form a garland for Narcissa's tomb;
3781,THE RELAPSE.,"And, peradventure, of no fading flowers."
3782,THE RELAPSE.,Say on what themes shall puzzled choice descend?
3783,THE RELAPSE.,"""Th' importance of contemplating the tomb;"
3784,THE RELAPSE.,Why men decline it; suicide's foul birth;
3785,THE RELAPSE.,The various kind of grief; the faults of age;
3786,THE RELAPSE.,"And Death's dread character--invite my song."""
3787,THE RELAPSE.,"And, first th' importance of our end survey'd."
3788,THE RELAPSE.,Friends counsel quick dismission of our grief:                     300
3789,THE RELAPSE.,Mistaken kindness! our hearts heal too soon.
3790,THE RELAPSE.,"Are they more kind than He, who struck the blow?"
3791,THE RELAPSE.,"Who bid it do his errand in our hearts,"
3792,THE RELAPSE.,"And banish peace, till nobler guests arrive,"
3793,THE RELAPSE.,"And bring it back, a true and endless peace?"
3794,THE RELAPSE.,Calamities are friends: as glaring day
3795,THE RELAPSE.,Of these unnumber'd lustres robs our sight;
3796,THE RELAPSE.,Prosperity puts out unnumber'd thoughts
3797,THE RELAPSE.,"Of import high, and light divine, to man."
3798,THE RELAPSE.,"The man how blest, who, sick of gaudy scenes,                    310"
3799,THE RELAPSE.,(Scenes apt to thrust between us and ourselves!)
3800,THE RELAPSE.,"Is led by choice to take his favourite walk,"
3801,THE RELAPSE.,"Beneath death's gloomy, silent, cypress shades,"
3802,THE RELAPSE.,Unpierced by vanity's fantastic ray;
3803,THE RELAPSE.,"To read his monuments, to weigh his dust,"
3804,THE RELAPSE.,"Visit his vaults, and dwell among the tombs!"
3805,THE RELAPSE.,Lorenzo[21] read with me Narcissa's stone;
3806,THE RELAPSE.,(Narcissa was thy favourite) let us read
3807,THE RELAPSE.,Her moral stone; few doctors preach so well;
3808,THE RELAPSE.,Few orators so tenderly can touch                                  320
3809,THE RELAPSE.,The feeling heart. What pathos in the date!
3810,THE RELAPSE.,Apt words can strike: and yet in them we see
3811,THE RELAPSE.,Faint images of what we here enjoy.
3812,THE RELAPSE.,What cause have we to build on length of life?
3813,THE RELAPSE.,"Temptations seize, when fear is laid asleep;                       325"
3814,THE RELAPSE.,And ill foreboded is our strongest guard.
3815,THE RELAPSE.,"See from her tomb, as from an humble shrine,"
3816,THE RELAPSE.,"Truth, radiant goddess! sallies on my soul,"
3817,THE RELAPSE.,And puts delusion's dusky train to flight;
3818,THE RELAPSE.,"Dispels the mists our sultry passions raise,"
3819,THE RELAPSE.,"From objects low, terrestrial, and obscene;"
3820,THE RELAPSE.,And shows the real estimate of things;                             332
3821,THE RELAPSE.,"Which no man, unafflicted, ever saw;"
3822,THE RELAPSE.,Pulls off the veil from virtue's rising charms;
3823,THE RELAPSE.,Detects temptation in a thousand lies.
3824,THE RELAPSE.,"Truth bids me look on men, as autumn leaves,"
3825,THE RELAPSE.,"And all they bleed for, as the summer's dust,"
3826,THE RELAPSE.,"Driven by the whirlwind: lighted by her beams,"
3827,THE RELAPSE.,"I widen my horizon, gain new powers,"
3828,THE RELAPSE.,"See things invisible, feel things remote,                          340"
3829,THE RELAPSE.,Am present with futurities; think nought
3830,THE RELAPSE.,"To man so foreign, as the joys possess'd;"
3831,THE RELAPSE.,"Nought so much his, as those beyond the grave."
3832,THE RELAPSE.,No folly keeps its colour in her sight;
3833,THE RELAPSE.,Pale worldly wisdom loses all her charms;
3834,THE RELAPSE.,"In pompous promise, from her schemes profound,"
3835,THE RELAPSE.,"If future fate she plans, 'tis all in leaves,"
3836,THE RELAPSE.,"Like Sibyl, unsubstantial, fleeting bliss!"
3837,THE RELAPSE.,At the first blast it vanishes in air.
3838,THE RELAPSE.,"Not so, celestial: would'st thou know, Lorenzo!                    350"
3839,THE RELAPSE.,"How differ worldly wisdom, and divine?"
3840,THE RELAPSE.,Just as the waning and the waxing moon.
3841,THE RELAPSE.,More empty worldly wisdom every day;
3842,THE RELAPSE.,And every day more fair her rival shines.
3843,THE RELAPSE.,"When later, there's less time to play the fool."
3844,THE RELAPSE.,Soon our whole term for wisdom is expired
3845,THE RELAPSE.,(Thou know'st she calls no council in the grave):
3846,THE RELAPSE.,"And everlasting fool is writ in fire,                              358"
3847,THE RELAPSE.,Or real wisdom wafts us to the skies.
3848,THE RELAPSE.,"As worldly schemes resemble Sibyl's leaves,"
3849,THE RELAPSE.,"The good man's days to Sibyl's books compare,"
3850,THE RELAPSE.,"(In ancient story read, thou know'st the tale),"
3851,THE RELAPSE.,"In price still rising, as in number less,"
3852,THE RELAPSE.,Inestimable quite his final hour.                                  364
3853,THE RELAPSE.,"For that who thrones can offer, offer thrones;"
3854,THE RELAPSE.,Insolvent worlds the purchase cannot pay.
3855,THE RELAPSE.,"""O let me die his death!"" all nature cries."
3856,THE RELAPSE.,"""Then live his life""--all nature falters there;"
3857,THE RELAPSE.,"Our great physician daily to consult,"
3858,THE RELAPSE.,"To commune with the grave, our only cure.                          370"
3859,THE RELAPSE.,"What grave prescribes the best?--A friend's; and yet,"
3860,THE RELAPSE.,"From a friend's grave, how soon we disengage!"
3861,THE RELAPSE.,"Even to the dearest, as his marble, cold."
3862,THE RELAPSE.,"Why are friends ravish'd from us? 'Tis to bind,"
3863,THE RELAPSE.,"By soft affection's ties, on human hearts,"
3864,THE RELAPSE.,"The thought of death, which reason, too supine,"
3865,THE RELAPSE.,"Or misemploy'd, so rarely fastens there."
3866,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor reason, nor affection, no, nor both"
3867,THE RELAPSE.,"Combined, can break the witchcrafts of the world."
3868,THE RELAPSE.,"Behold, th' inexorable hour at hand!                               380"
3869,THE RELAPSE.,"Behold, th' inexorable hour forgot!"
3870,THE RELAPSE.,"And to forget it, the chief aim of life,"
3871,THE RELAPSE.,"Though well to ponder it, is life's chief end."
3872,THE RELAPSE.,"Is Death, that ever threatening, ne'er remote,"
3873,THE RELAPSE.,"That all-important, and that only sure"
3874,THE RELAPSE.,"(Come when he will), an unexpected guest?"
3875,THE RELAPSE.,"Nay, though invited by the loudest calls"
3876,THE RELAPSE.,"Of blind imprudence, unexpected still;"
3877,THE RELAPSE.,"Though numerous messengers are sent before,"
3878,THE RELAPSE.,"To warn his great arrival. What the cause,                         390"
3879,THE RELAPSE.,"The wondrous cause, of this mysterious ill?                        391"
3880,THE RELAPSE.,All heaven looks down astonish'd at the sight.
3881,THE RELAPSE.,"Is it, that life has sown her joys so thick,"
3882,THE RELAPSE.,We can't thrust in a single care between?
3883,THE RELAPSE.,"Is it, that life has such a swarm of cares,"
3884,THE RELAPSE.,The thought of death can't enter for the throng?
3885,THE RELAPSE.,"Is it, that time steals on with downy feet,"
3886,THE RELAPSE.,Nor wakes indulgence from her golden dream?
3887,THE RELAPSE.,"To-day is so like yesterday, it cheats;"
3888,THE RELAPSE.,We take the lying sister for the same.                             400
3889,THE RELAPSE.,"Life glides away, Lorenzo, like a brook;"
3890,THE RELAPSE.,"For ever changing, unperceived the change."
3891,THE RELAPSE.,In the same brook none ever bathed him twice:
3892,THE RELAPSE.,To the same life none ever twice awoke.
3893,THE RELAPSE.,We call the brook the same; the same we think
3894,THE RELAPSE.,"Our life, though still more rapid in its flow;"
3895,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor mark the much, irrevocably lapsed,"
3896,THE RELAPSE.,And mingled with the sea. Or shall we say
3897,THE RELAPSE.,(Retaining still the brook to bear us on)
3898,THE RELAPSE.,That life is like a vessel on the stream?                          410
3899,THE RELAPSE.,"In life embark'd, we smoothly down the tide"
3900,THE RELAPSE.,"Of time descend, but not on time intent;"
3901,THE RELAPSE.,"Amused, unconscious of the gliding wave;"
3902,THE RELAPSE.,Till on a sudden we perceive a shock;
3903,THE RELAPSE.,"We start, awake, look out; what see we there?"
3904,THE RELAPSE.,Our brittle bark is burst on Charon's shore.
3905,THE RELAPSE.,Is this the cause death flies all human thought?
3906,THE RELAPSE.,"Or is it judgment, by the will struck blind,"
3907,THE RELAPSE.,That domineering mistress of the soul!
3908,THE RELAPSE.,"Like him so strong, by Dalilah the fair?                           420"
3909,THE RELAPSE.,"Or is it fear turns startled reason back,"
3910,THE RELAPSE.,From looking down a precipice so steep?
3911,THE RELAPSE.,"'Tis dreadful; and the dread is wisely placed,"
3912,THE RELAPSE.,"By nature, conscious of the make of man."

3914,THE RELAPSE.,A flaming sword to guard the tree of life.
3915,THE RELAPSE.,"By that unawed, in life's most smiling hour,"
3916,THE RELAPSE.,"The good man would repine; would suffer joys,"
3917,THE RELAPSE.,And burn impatient for his promised skies.
3918,THE RELAPSE.,"The bad, on each punctilious pique of pride,"
3919,THE RELAPSE.,"Or gloom of humour, would give rage the rein;"
3920,THE RELAPSE.,"Bound o'er the barrier, rush into the dark,                        432"
3921,THE RELAPSE.,And mar the schemes of Providence below.
3922,THE RELAPSE.,"What groan was that, Lorenzo?--Furies! rise,"
3923,THE RELAPSE.,And drown in your less execrable yell
3924,THE RELAPSE.,"Britannia's shame. There took her gloomy flight,"
3925,THE RELAPSE.,"On wing impetuous, a black sullen soul,"
3926,THE RELAPSE.,"Blasted from hell, with horrid lust of death;"
3927,THE RELAPSE.,"Thy friend, the brave, the gallant Altamont,"
3928,THE RELAPSE.,"So call'd, so thought--and then he fled the field.                 440"
3929,THE RELAPSE.,"Less base the fear of death, than fear of life."
3930,THE RELAPSE.,"O Britain, infamous for suicide!"
3931,THE RELAPSE.,An island in thy manners! far disjoin'd
3932,THE RELAPSE.,From the whole world of rationals beside!
3933,THE RELAPSE.,"In ambient waves plunge thy polluted head,"
3934,THE RELAPSE.,"Wash the dire stain, nor shock the Continent."
3935,THE RELAPSE.,"But thou be shock'd, while I detect the cause"
3936,THE RELAPSE.,"Of self-assault, expose the monster's birth,"
3937,THE RELAPSE.,And bid abhorrence hiss it round the world.
3938,THE RELAPSE.,"Blame not thy clime, nor chide the distant sun;                    450"
3939,THE RELAPSE.,"The sun is innocent, thy clime absolved:"
3940,THE RELAPSE.,Immoral climes kind nature never made.
3941,THE RELAPSE.,"The cause I sing, in Eden might prevail,"
3942,THE RELAPSE.,"And proves, it is thy folly, not thy fate."
3943,THE RELAPSE.,"The soul of man (let man in homage bow,"
3944,THE RELAPSE.,"Who names his soul), a native of the skies!"
3945,THE RELAPSE.,"High-born, and free, her freedom should maintain,"
3946,THE RELAPSE.,"Unsold, unmortgaged for earth's little bribes."
3947,THE RELAPSE.,"Th' illustrious stranger, in this foreign land,                    459"
3948,THE RELAPSE.,"Like strangers, jealous of her dignity,"
3949,THE RELAPSE.,"Studious of home, and ardent to return,"
3950,THE RELAPSE.,"Of earth suspicious, earth's enchanted cup"
3951,THE RELAPSE.,"With cool reserve light touching, should indulge"
3952,THE RELAPSE.,On immortality her godlike taste;
3953,THE RELAPSE.,"There take large draughts, make her chief banquet there."
3954,THE RELAPSE.,But some reject this sustenance divine;
3955,THE RELAPSE.,To beggarly vile appetites descend;
3956,THE RELAPSE.,"Ask alms of earth, for guests that came from heaven!"
3957,THE RELAPSE.,"Sink into slaves; and sell, for present hire,"
3958,THE RELAPSE.,"Their rich reversion, and (what shares its fate)                   470"
3959,THE RELAPSE.,"Their native freedom, to the prince who sways"
3960,THE RELAPSE.,"This nether world. And when his payments fail,"
3961,THE RELAPSE.,"When his foul basket gorges them no more,"
3962,THE RELAPSE.,Or their pall'd palates loathe the basket full;
3963,THE RELAPSE.,"Are instantly, with wild demoniac rage,"
3964,THE RELAPSE.,"For breaking all the chains of Providence,"
3965,THE RELAPSE.,And bursting their confinement; though fast barr'd
3966,THE RELAPSE.,By laws divine and human; guarded strong
3967,THE RELAPSE.,"With horrors doubled to defend the pass,"
3968,THE RELAPSE.,"The blackest, nature, or dire guilt, can raise;                    480"

3972,THE RELAPSE.,"Or worse, o'erlook'd; o'erlook'd by magistrates,"
3973,THE RELAPSE.,Thus criminals themselves. I grant the deed
3974,THE RELAPSE.,"Is madness, but the madness of the heart."
3975,THE RELAPSE.,And what is that? Our utmost bound of guilt.
3976,THE RELAPSE.,"A sensual, unreflecting life, is big"
3977,THE RELAPSE.,"With monstrous births, and suicide, to crown"
3978,THE RELAPSE.,The black infernal brood. The bold to break                        490
3979,THE RELAPSE.,"Heaven's law supreme, and desperately rush,"
3980,THE RELAPSE.,"Through sacred Nature's murder, on their own,"

3982,THE RELAPSE.,"'Tis equally man's duty, glory, gain,"
3983,THE RELAPSE.,"At once to shun, and meditate, his end."
3984,THE RELAPSE.,When by the bed of languishment we sit
3985,THE RELAPSE.,"(The seat of wisdom! if our choice, not fate),"
3986,THE RELAPSE.,"Or, o'er our dying friends, in anguish hang,"
3987,THE RELAPSE.,"Wipe the cold dew, or stay the sinking head,"
3988,THE RELAPSE.,"Number their moments, and, in every clock,                         500"
3989,THE RELAPSE.,Start at the voice of an eternity;
3990,THE RELAPSE.,See the dim lamp of life just feebly lift
3991,THE RELAPSE.,"An agonizing beam, at us to gaze,"
3992,THE RELAPSE.,"Then sink again, and quiver into death,"
3993,THE RELAPSE.,That most pathetic herald of our own;
3994,THE RELAPSE.,How read we such sad scenes? As sent to man
3995,THE RELAPSE.,"In perfect vengeance? No; in pity sent,"
3996,THE RELAPSE.,"To melt him down, like wax, and then impress,"
3997,THE RELAPSE.,"Indelible, Death's image on his heart;"
3998,THE RELAPSE.,"Bleeding for others, trembling for himself.                        510"
3999,THE RELAPSE.,"We bleed, we tremble, we forget, we smile."
4000,THE RELAPSE.,"The mind turns fool, before the cheek is dry."
4001,THE RELAPSE.,Our quick-returning folly cancels all;
4002,THE RELAPSE.,As the tide rushing razes what is writ
4003,THE RELAPSE.,"In yielding sands, and smooths the letter'd shore."
4004,THE RELAPSE.,Lorenzo! hast thou ever weigh'd a sigh?
4005,THE RELAPSE.,Or studied the philosophy of tears?
4006,THE RELAPSE.,"(A science, yet unlectured in our schools!)"
4007,THE RELAPSE.,"Hast thou descended deep into the breast,"
4008,THE RELAPSE.,"And seen their source? If not, descend with me,                    520"
4009,THE RELAPSE.,And trace these briny rivulets to their springs.
4010,THE RELAPSE.,"Our funeral tears from different causes rise,"
4011,THE RELAPSE.,"As if from separate cisterns in the soul,"
4012,THE RELAPSE.,"Of various kinds, they flow. From tender hearts,"
4013,THE RELAPSE.,"By soft contagion call'd, some burst at once,"
4014,THE RELAPSE.,And stream obsequious to the leading eye.
4015,THE RELAPSE.,"Some ask more time, by curious art distill'd.                      527"
4016,THE RELAPSE.,"Some hearts, in secret hard, unapt to melt,"
4017,THE RELAPSE.,"Struck by the magic of the public eye,"
4018,THE RELAPSE.,"Like Moses' smitten rock, gush out amain."
4019,THE RELAPSE.,"Some weep to share the fame of the deceased,"
4020,THE RELAPSE.,"So high in merit, and to them so dear."
4021,THE RELAPSE.,"They dwell on praises, which they think they share;                533"
4022,THE RELAPSE.,"And thus, without a blush, commend themselves."
4023,THE RELAPSE.,"Some mourn, in proof that something they could love:"
4024,THE RELAPSE.,"They weep not to relieve their grief, but show."
4025,THE RELAPSE.,"Some weep in perfect justice to the dead,"
4026,THE RELAPSE.,As conscious all their love is in arrear.
4027,THE RELAPSE.,"Some mischievously weep, not unapprised"
4028,THE RELAPSE.,"Tears, sometimes, aid the conquest of an eye.                      540"
4029,THE RELAPSE.,With what address the soft Ephesians draw
4030,THE RELAPSE.,Their sable network o'er entangled hearts!
4031,THE RELAPSE.,"As seen through crystal, how their roses glow,"
4032,THE RELAPSE.,While liquid pearl runs trickling down their cheek!
4033,THE RELAPSE.,"Of hers not prouder Egypt's wanton queen,"
4034,THE RELAPSE.,"Carousing gems, herself dissolved in love."
4035,THE RELAPSE.,"Some weep at death, abstracted from the dead,"
4036,THE RELAPSE.,"And celebrate, like Charles,[22] their own decease."
4037,THE RELAPSE.,"By kind construction some are deem'd to weep,"
4038,THE RELAPSE.,Because a decent veil conceals their joy.                          550
4039,THE RELAPSE.,"Some weep in earnest, and yet weep in vain;"
4040,THE RELAPSE.,"As deep in indiscretion, as in woe."
4041,THE RELAPSE.,"Passion, blind Passion! impotently pours"
4042,THE RELAPSE.,"Tears, that deserve more tears; while Reason sleeps;"
4043,THE RELAPSE.,"Or gazes like an idiot, unconcern'd;"
4044,THE RELAPSE.,Nor comprehends the meaning of the storm;
4045,THE RELAPSE.,"Knows not it speaks to her, and her alone."
4046,THE RELAPSE.,"Irrationals all sorrow are beneath,"
4047,THE RELAPSE.,That noble gift! that privilege of man!
4048,THE RELAPSE.,"From sorrow's pang, the birth of endless joy.                      560"
4049,THE RELAPSE.,But these are barren of that birth divine:
4050,THE RELAPSE.,"They weep impetuous, as the summer storm,"
4051,THE RELAPSE.,"And full as short! The cruel grief soon tamed,"
4052,THE RELAPSE.,They make a pastime of the stingless tale;
4053,THE RELAPSE.,"Far as the deep resounding knell, they spread"
4054,THE RELAPSE.,"The dreadful news, and hardly feel it more."
4055,THE RELAPSE.,No grain of wisdom pays them for their woe.
4056,THE RELAPSE.,"Half-round the globe, the tears pump'd up by Death"
4057,THE RELAPSE.,Are spent in watering vanities of life;
4058,THE RELAPSE.,"In making folly flourish still more fair,                          570"
4059,THE RELAPSE.,"When the sick soul, her wonted stay withdrawn,"
4060,THE RELAPSE.,"Reclines on earth, and sorrows in the dust;"
4061,THE RELAPSE.,"Instead of learning, there, her true support,"
4062,THE RELAPSE.,Though there thrown down her true support to learn.
4063,THE RELAPSE.,"Without Heaven's aid, impatient to be bless'd,"
4064,THE RELAPSE.,"She crawls to the next shrub, or bramble vile,"
4065,THE RELAPSE.,Though from the stately cedar's arms she fell;
4066,THE RELAPSE.,"With stale, forsworn embraces, clings anew,"
4067,THE RELAPSE.,"The stranger weds, and blossoms, as before,"
4068,THE RELAPSE.,In all the fruitless fopperies of life:                            580
4069,THE RELAPSE.,"Presents her weed, well-fancied, at the ball,"
4070,THE RELAPSE.,And raffles for the Death's-head on the ring.
4071,THE RELAPSE.,"So wept Aurelia, till the destined youth"
4072,THE RELAPSE.,"Stepp'd in, with his receipt for making smiles,"
4073,THE RELAPSE.,And blanching sables into bridal bloom.
4074,THE RELAPSE.,So wept Lorenzo fair Clarissa's fate;
4075,THE RELAPSE.,"Who gave that angel boy, on whom he doats;"
4076,THE RELAPSE.,"And died to give him, orphan'd in his birth!"
4077,THE RELAPSE.,"Not such, Narcissa, my distress for thee."
4078,THE RELAPSE.,"I'll make an altar of thy sacred tomb,                             590"
4079,THE RELAPSE.,To sacrifice to wisdom.--What wast thou?
4080,THE RELAPSE.,"""Young, gay, and fortunate!"" Each yields a theme."
4081,THE RELAPSE.,"I'll dwell on each, to shun thought more severe;"
4082,THE RELAPSE.,(Heaven knows I labour with severer still!)                        594
4083,THE RELAPSE.,"I'll dwell on each, and quite exhaust thy death."
4084,THE RELAPSE.,"A soul without reflection, like a pile"
4085,THE RELAPSE.,"Without inhabitant, to ruin runs."
4086,THE RELAPSE.,"And, first, thy youth. What says it to grey hairs?"
4087,THE RELAPSE.,"Narcissa, I'm become thy pupil now--"
4088,THE RELAPSE.,"Early, bright, transient, chaste, as morning dew,"
4089,THE RELAPSE.,"She sparkled, was exhaled, and went to heaven."
4090,THE RELAPSE.,Time on this head has snow'd; yet still 'tis borne                 602
4091,THE RELAPSE.,Aloft; nor thinks but on another's grave.
4092,THE RELAPSE.,"Cover'd with shame I speak it, age severe"
4093,THE RELAPSE.,Old worn-out vice sets down for virtue fair;
4094,THE RELAPSE.,"With graceless gravity, chastising youth,"
4095,THE RELAPSE.,"That youth chastised surpassing in a fault,"
4096,THE RELAPSE.,"Father of all, forgetfulness of death:"
4097,THE RELAPSE.,"As if, like objects pressing on the sight,"
4098,THE RELAPSE.,Death had advanced too near us to be seen:                         610
4099,THE RELAPSE.,"Or, that life's loan Time ripen'd into right;"
4100,THE RELAPSE.,And men might plead prescription from the grave;
4101,THE RELAPSE.,"Deathless, from repetition of reprieve."
4102,THE RELAPSE.,Deathless? far from it! such are dead already;
4103,THE RELAPSE.,"Their hearts are buried, and the world their grave."
4104,THE RELAPSE.,"Tell me, some god! my guardian angel! tell,"
4105,THE RELAPSE.,What thus infatuates? what enchantment plants
4106,THE RELAPSE.,"The phantom of an age 'twixt us, and Death"
4107,THE RELAPSE.,"Already at the door? He knocks, we hear,"
4108,THE RELAPSE.,And yet we will not hear. What mail defends                        620
4109,THE RELAPSE.,Our untouch'd hearts? what miracle turns off
4110,THE RELAPSE.,"The pointed thought, which from a thousand quivers"
4111,THE RELAPSE.,"Is daily darted, and is daily shunn'd?"
4112,THE RELAPSE.,"We stand, as in a battle, throngs on throngs"
4113,THE RELAPSE.,Around us falling; wounded oft ourselves;
4114,THE RELAPSE.,"Though bleeding with our wounds, immortal still!"
4115,THE RELAPSE.,"We see Time's furrows on another's brow,"
4116,THE RELAPSE.,"And Death intrench'd, preparing his assault;                       628"
4117,THE RELAPSE.,"How few themselves, in that just mirror, see,"
4118,THE RELAPSE.,"Or, seeing, draw their inference as strong!"
4119,THE RELAPSE.,"There, death is certain; doubtful here: he must,"
4120,THE RELAPSE.,"And soon; we may, within an age, expire."
4121,THE RELAPSE.,"Though grey our heads, our thoughts and aims are green;"
4122,THE RELAPSE.,"Like damaged clocks, whose hand and bell dissent;"
4123,THE RELAPSE.,"Folly sings six, while Nature points at twelve."
4124,THE RELAPSE.,"Absurd longevity! More, more! it cries:"
4125,THE RELAPSE.,"More life, more wealth, more trash of every kind."
4126,THE RELAPSE.,"And wherefore mad for more, when relish fails?"
4127,THE RELAPSE.,"Object, and appetite, must club for joy;"
4128,THE RELAPSE.,"Shall Folly labour hard to mend the bow,                           640"
4129,THE RELAPSE.,"Baubles, I mean, that strike us from without,"
4130,THE RELAPSE.,While Nature is relaxing every string?
4131,THE RELAPSE.,"Ask thought for joy; grow rich, and hoard within."
4132,THE RELAPSE.,"Think you the soul, when this life's rattles cease,"
4133,THE RELAPSE.,Has nothing of more manly to succeed?
4134,THE RELAPSE.,Contract the taste immortal; learn even now
4135,THE RELAPSE.,To relish what alone subsists hereafter.
4136,THE RELAPSE.,"Divine, or none, henceforth your joys for ever."
4137,THE RELAPSE.,"Of age the glory is, to wish to die."
4138,THE RELAPSE.,"That wish is praise, and promise; it applauds                      650"
4139,THE RELAPSE.,"Past life, and promises our future bliss."
4140,THE RELAPSE.,What weakness see not children in their sires?
4141,THE RELAPSE.,Grand-climacterical absurdities!
4142,THE RELAPSE.,"Grey-hair'd authority, to faults of youth,"
4143,THE RELAPSE.,How shocking! it makes folly thrice a fool;
4144,THE RELAPSE.,And our first childhood might our last despise.
4145,THE RELAPSE.,Peace and esteem is all that age can hope.
4146,THE RELAPSE.,"Nothing but wisdom gives the first; the last,"
4147,THE RELAPSE.,"Nothing, but the repute of being wise."
4148,THE RELAPSE.,Folly bars both; our age is quite undone.                          660
4149,THE RELAPSE.,"What folly can be ranker? Like our shadows,"
4150,THE RELAPSE.,"Our wishes lengthen, as our sun declines.                          662"
4151,THE RELAPSE.,"No wish should loiter, then, this side the grave."
4152,THE RELAPSE.,"Our hearts should leave the world, before the knell"
4153,THE RELAPSE.,Calls for our carcases to mend the soil.
4154,THE RELAPSE.,"Enough to live in tempest, die in port;"
4155,THE RELAPSE.,"Age should fly concourse, cover in retreat"
4156,THE RELAPSE.,Defects of judgment; and the will subdue;
4157,THE RELAPSE.,"Walk thoughtful on the silent, solemn shore"
4158,THE RELAPSE.,Of that vast ocean it must sail so soon;                           670
4159,THE RELAPSE.,And put good works on board; and wait the wind
4160,THE RELAPSE.,That shortly blows us into worlds unknown:
4161,THE RELAPSE.,"If unconsider'd too, a dreadful scene!"
4162,THE RELAPSE.,All should be prophets to themselves; foresee
4163,THE RELAPSE.,Their future fate; their future fate foretaste;
4164,THE RELAPSE.,This art would waste the bitterness of death.
4165,THE RELAPSE.,"The thought of death alone, the fear destroys."
4166,THE RELAPSE.,A disaffection to that precious thought
4167,THE RELAPSE.,"Is more than midnight darkness on the soul,"
4168,THE RELAPSE.,"Which sleeps beneath it, on a precipice,                           680"
4169,THE RELAPSE.,"Puff'd off by the first blast, and lost for ever."
4170,THE RELAPSE.,"Dost ask, Lorenzo, why so warmly press'd,"
4171,THE RELAPSE.,"By repetition hammer'd on thine ear,"
4172,THE RELAPSE.,"The thought of death? That thought is the machine,"
4173,THE RELAPSE.,"The grand machine, that heaves us from the dust,"
4174,THE RELAPSE.,"And rears us into men. That thought, plied home,"
4175,THE RELAPSE.,Will soon reduce the ghastly precipice
4176,THE RELAPSE.,"O'er-hanging hell, will soften the descent,"
4177,THE RELAPSE.,And gently slope our passage to the grave;
4178,THE RELAPSE.,How warmly to be wish'd! What heart of flesh                       690
4179,THE RELAPSE.,Would trifle with tremendous? dare extremes?
4180,THE RELAPSE.,"Yawn o'er the fate of infinite? What hand,"
4181,THE RELAPSE.,"Beyond the blackest brand of censure bold,"
4182,THE RELAPSE.,"(To speak a language too well known to thee),"
4183,THE RELAPSE.,"Would at a moment give its all to chance,                          695"
4184,THE RELAPSE.,And stamp the die for an eternity?
4185,THE RELAPSE.,"Aid me, Narcissa! aid me to keep pace"
4186,THE RELAPSE.,With Destiny; and ere her scissors cut
4187,THE RELAPSE.,"My thread of life, to break this tougher thread"
4188,THE RELAPSE.,"Of moral death, that ties me to the world."
4189,THE RELAPSE.,Sting thou my slumbering reason to send forth
4190,THE RELAPSE.,A thought of observation on the foe;                               702
4191,THE RELAPSE.,To sally; and survey the rapid march
4192,THE RELAPSE.,Of his ten thousand messengers to man;
4193,THE RELAPSE.,"Who, Jehu-like, behind him turns them all."
4194,THE RELAPSE.,"All accident apart, by Nature sign'd,"
4195,THE RELAPSE.,"My warrant is gone out, though dormant yet;"
4196,THE RELAPSE.,Perhaps behind one moment lurks my fate.
4197,THE RELAPSE.,Must I then forward only look for Death?
4198,THE RELAPSE.,"Backward I turn mine eye, and find him there.                      710"
4199,THE RELAPSE.,Man is a self-survivor every year.
4200,THE RELAPSE.,"Man, like a stream, is in perpetual flow."
4201,THE RELAPSE.,Death's a destroyer of quotidian[23] prey.
4202,THE RELAPSE.,"My youth, my noontide, his; my yesterday;"
4203,THE RELAPSE.,The bold invader shares the present hour.
4204,THE RELAPSE.,Each moment on the former shuts the grave.
4205,THE RELAPSE.,"While man is growing, life is in decrease;"
4206,THE RELAPSE.,And cradles rock us nearer to the tomb.
4207,THE RELAPSE.,Our birth is nothing but our death begun;
4208,THE RELAPSE.,"As tapers waste, that instant they take fire.                      720"
4209,THE RELAPSE.,"Shall we then fear, lest that should come to pass,"
4210,THE RELAPSE.,Which comes to pass each moment of our lives?
4211,THE RELAPSE.,"If fear we must, let that Death turn us pale,"
4212,THE RELAPSE.,Which murders strength and ardour; what remains
4213,THE RELAPSE.,"Should rather call on Death, than dread his call."
4214,THE RELAPSE.,"Ye partners of my fault, and my decline!"
4215,THE RELAPSE.,"Thoughtless of death, but when your neighbour's knell"
4216,THE RELAPSE.,"(Rude visitant!) knocks hard at your dull sense,"
4217,THE RELAPSE.,And with its thunder scarce obtains your ear!                      729
4218,THE RELAPSE.,"Be death your theme, in every place and hour;"
4219,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor longer want, ye monumental sires!"
4220,THE RELAPSE.,A brother tomb to tell you ye shall die.
4221,THE RELAPSE.,That death you dread (so great is Nature's skill)
4222,THE RELAPSE.,"Know, you shall court before you shall enjoy."
4223,THE RELAPSE.,"But you are learn'd; in volumes deep, you sit;"
4224,THE RELAPSE.,"In wisdom, shallow: pompous ignorance!"
4225,THE RELAPSE.,Would you be still more learned than the learn'd?
4226,THE RELAPSE.,"Learn well to know how much need not be known,"
4227,THE RELAPSE.,"And what that knowledge, which impairs your sense."
4228,THE RELAPSE.,"Our needful knowledge, like our needful food,                      740"
4229,THE RELAPSE.,"Unhedged, lies open in life's common field;"
4230,THE RELAPSE.,And bids all welcome to the vital feast.
4231,THE RELAPSE.,You scorn what lies before you in the page
4232,THE RELAPSE.,"Of Nature, and Experience, moral truth;"
4233,THE RELAPSE.,"Of indispensable, eternal fruit;"
4234,THE RELAPSE.,"Fruit, on which mortals feeding, turn to gods:"
4235,THE RELAPSE.,"And dive in science for distinguish'd names,"
4236,THE RELAPSE.,Dishonest fomentation of your pride!
4237,THE RELAPSE.,"Sinking in virtue, as you rise in fame."
4238,THE RELAPSE.,"Your learning, like the lunar beam, affords                        750"
4239,THE RELAPSE.,"Light, but not heat; it leaves you indevout,"
4240,THE RELAPSE.,"Frozen at heart, while speculation shines."
4241,THE RELAPSE.,"Awake, ye curious indagators! fond"
4242,THE RELAPSE.,"Of knowing all, but what avails you known."
4243,THE RELAPSE.,"If you would learn Death's character, attend."
4244,THE RELAPSE.,"All casts of conduct, all degrees of health,"
4245,THE RELAPSE.,"All dies of fortune, and all dates of age,"
4246,THE RELAPSE.,"Together shook in his impartial urn,"
4247,THE RELAPSE.,"Come forth at random: or, if choice is made,"
4248,THE RELAPSE.,"The choice is quite sarcastic, and insults                         760"
4249,THE RELAPSE.,"All bold conjecture, and fond hopes of man."
4250,THE RELAPSE.,"What countless multitudes not only leave,"
4251,THE RELAPSE.,"But deeply disappoint us, by their deaths!                         763"
4252,THE RELAPSE.,"Though great our sorrow, greater our surprise."
4253,THE RELAPSE.,"Like other tyrants, Death delights to smite,"
4254,THE RELAPSE.,"What, smitten, most proclaims the pride of power,"
4255,THE RELAPSE.,"And arbitrary nod. His joy supreme,"
4256,THE RELAPSE.,To bid the wretch survive the fortunate;
4257,THE RELAPSE.,The feeble wrap th' athletic in his shroud;
4258,THE RELAPSE.,And weeping fathers build their children's tomb:                   770
4259,THE RELAPSE.,"Me thine, Narcissa!--What though short thy date?"
4260,THE RELAPSE.,"Virtue, not rolling suns, the mind matures."
4261,THE RELAPSE.,"That life is long, which answers life's great end."
4262,THE RELAPSE.,"The time that bears no fruit, deserves no name;"
4263,THE RELAPSE.,The man of wisdom is the man of years.
4264,THE RELAPSE.,In hoary youth Methusalems may die;
4265,THE RELAPSE.,O how misdated on their flattering tombs!
4266,THE RELAPSE.,Narcissa's youth has lectured me thus far.
4267,THE RELAPSE.,And can her gaiety give counsel too?
4268,THE RELAPSE.,"That, like the Jews' famed oracle of gems,[24]                     780"
4269,THE RELAPSE.,"Sparkles instruction; such as throws new light,"
4270,THE RELAPSE.,And opens more the character of Death;
4271,THE RELAPSE.,"Ill known to thee, Lorenzo! This thy vaunt:"
4272,THE RELAPSE.,"""Give Death his due, the wretched, and the old;"
4273,THE RELAPSE.,Even let him sweep his rubbish to the grave;
4274,THE RELAPSE.,"Let him not violate kind Nature's laws,"
4275,THE RELAPSE.,"But own man born to live as well as die."""
4276,THE RELAPSE.,Wretched and old thou givest him; young and gay
4277,THE RELAPSE.,He takes; and plunder is a tyrant's joy.
4278,THE RELAPSE.,"What if I prove, ""The farthest from the fear,                      790"
4279,THE RELAPSE.,"Are often nearest to the stroke of Fate?"""
4280,THE RELAPSE.,"All, more than common, menaces an end."
4281,THE RELAPSE.,A blaze betokens brevity of life:
4282,THE RELAPSE.,"As if bright embers should emit a flame,"
4283,THE RELAPSE.,"Glad spirits sparkled from Narcissa's eye,"
4284,THE RELAPSE.,"And made youth younger, and taught life to live,                   796"
4285,THE RELAPSE.,"As Nature's opposites wage endless war,"
4286,THE RELAPSE.,"For this offence, as treason to the deep"
4287,THE RELAPSE.,"Inviolable stupor of his reign,"
4288,THE RELAPSE.,"Where Lust, and turbulent Ambition, sleep,"
4289,THE RELAPSE.,"Death took swift vengeance. As he life detests,"
4290,THE RELAPSE.,"More life is still more odious; and, reduced"
4291,THE RELAPSE.,"By conquest, aggrandizes more his power.                           803"
4292,THE RELAPSE.,"But wherefore aggrandized? By Heaven's decree,"
4293,THE RELAPSE.,"To plant the soul on her eternal guard,"
4294,THE RELAPSE.,In awful expectation of our end.
4295,THE RELAPSE.,"Thus runs Death's dread commission: ""Strike, but so"
4296,THE RELAPSE.,"As most alarms the living by the dead."""
4297,THE RELAPSE.,"Hence stratagem delights him, and surprise,"
4298,THE RELAPSE.,And cruel sport with man's securities.                             810
4299,THE RELAPSE.,"Not simple conquest, triumph is his aim;"
4300,THE RELAPSE.,"And, where least fear'd, there conquest triumphs most."
4301,THE RELAPSE.,This proves my bold assertion not too bold.
4302,THE RELAPSE.,What are his arts to lay our fears asleep?
4303,THE RELAPSE.,Tiberian arts his purposes wrap up
4304,THE RELAPSE.,In deep dissimulation's darkest night.
4305,THE RELAPSE.,"Like princes unconfess'd in foreign courts,"
4306,THE RELAPSE.,"Who travel under cover, Death assumes"
4307,THE RELAPSE.,"The name and look of life, and dwells among us."
4308,THE RELAPSE.,He takes all shapes that serve his black designs:                  820
4309,THE RELAPSE.,Though master of a wider empire far
4310,THE RELAPSE.,Than that o'er which the Roman eagle flew.
4311,THE RELAPSE.,"Like Nero, he's a fiddler, charioteer,"
4312,THE RELAPSE.,"Or drives his phaeton, in female guise;"
4313,THE RELAPSE.,"Quite unsuspected, till, the wheel beneath,"
4314,THE RELAPSE.,His disarray'd oblation he devours.
4315,THE RELAPSE.,"He most affects the forms least like himself,"
4316,THE RELAPSE.,His slender self. Hence burly corpulence
4317,THE RELAPSE.,"Is his familiar wear, and sleek disguise."
4318,THE RELAPSE.,"Behind the rosy bloom he loves to lurk,                            830"
4319,THE RELAPSE.,Or ambush in a smile; or wanton dive
4320,THE RELAPSE.,"In dimples deep; love's eddies, which draw in"
4321,THE RELAPSE.,"Unwary hearts, and sink them in despair."
4322,THE RELAPSE.,"Such, on Narcissa's couch he loiter'd long"
4323,THE RELAPSE.,"Unknown; and, when detected, still was seen"
4324,THE RELAPSE.,To smile; such peace has innocence in death!
4325,THE RELAPSE.,Most happy they! whom least his arts deceive.
4326,THE RELAPSE.,"One eye on Death, and one full fix'd on heaven,"
4327,THE RELAPSE.,"Becomes a mortal, and immortal man."
4328,THE RELAPSE.,"Long on his wiles a piqued and jealous spy,                        840"
4329,THE RELAPSE.,"I've seen, or dreamt I saw, the tyrant dress;"
4330,THE RELAPSE.,"Lay by his horrors, and put on his smiles."
4331,THE RELAPSE.,"Say, Muse, for thou remember'st, call it back,"
4332,THE RELAPSE.,And show Lorenzo the surprising scene;
4333,THE RELAPSE.,"If 'twas a dream, his genius can explain."
4334,THE RELAPSE.,'Twas in a circle of the gay I stood.
4335,THE RELAPSE.,Death would have enter'd; Nature push'd him back;
4336,THE RELAPSE.,"Supported by a doctor of renown,"
4337,THE RELAPSE.,His point he gain'd. Then artfully dismiss'd
4338,THE RELAPSE.,The sage; for Death design'd to be conceal'd.                      850
4339,THE RELAPSE.,He gave an old vivacious usurer
4340,THE RELAPSE.,"His meagre aspect, and his naked bones;"
4341,THE RELAPSE.,"In gratitude for plumping up his prey,"
4342,THE RELAPSE.,"A pamper'd spendthrift; whose fantastic air,"
4343,THE RELAPSE.,"Well-fashion'd figure, and cockaded[25] brow,"
4344,THE RELAPSE.,"He took in change, and underneath the pride"
4345,THE RELAPSE.,"Of costly linen, tuck'd his filthy shroud."
4346,THE RELAPSE.,His crooked bow he straighten'd to a cane;
4347,THE RELAPSE.,And hid his deadly shafts in Myra's eye.
4348,THE RELAPSE.,"The dreadful masquerader, thus equipp'd,                         860"
4349,THE RELAPSE.,Out sallies on adventures. Ask you where?
4350,THE RELAPSE.,"Where is he not? For his peculiar haunts,"
4351,THE RELAPSE.,"Let this suffice; sure as night follows day,"
4352,THE RELAPSE.,"Death treads in pleasure's footsteps round the world,              864"
4353,THE RELAPSE.,"When pleasure treads the paths, which reason shuns."
4354,THE RELAPSE.,"When, against reason, riot shuts the door,"
4355,THE RELAPSE.,"And gaiety supplies the place of sense,"
4356,THE RELAPSE.,"Then, foremost at the banquet, and the ball,"
4357,THE RELAPSE.,"Death leads the dance, or stamps the deadly die;"
4358,THE RELAPSE.,Nor ever fails the midnight bowl to crown.                         870
4359,THE RELAPSE.,"Gaily carousing to his gay compeers,"
4360,THE RELAPSE.,"Inly he laughs, to see them laugh at him,"
4361,THE RELAPSE.,"As absent far: and when the revel burns,"
4362,THE RELAPSE.,"When fear is banish'd, and triumphant thought,"
4363,THE RELAPSE.,"Calling for all the joys beneath the moon,"
4364,THE RELAPSE.,Against him turns the key; and bids him sup
4365,THE RELAPSE.,With their progenitors--He drops his mask;
4366,THE RELAPSE.,"Frowns out at full; they start, despair, expire."
4367,THE RELAPSE.,"Scarce with more sudden terror and surprise,"
4368,THE RELAPSE.,"From his black mask of nitre, touch'd by fire,                     880"
4369,THE RELAPSE.,"He bursts, expands, roars, blazes, and devours."
4370,THE RELAPSE.,"And is not this triumphant treachery,"
4371,THE RELAPSE.,"And more than simple conquest, in the fiend?"
4372,THE RELAPSE.,"And now, Lorenzo, dost thou wrap thy soul"
4373,THE RELAPSE.,"In soft security, because unknown"
4374,THE RELAPSE.,Which moment is commission'd to destroy?
4375,THE RELAPSE.,In death's uncertainty thy danger lies.
4376,THE RELAPSE.,Is death uncertain? Therefore thou be fix'd;
4377,THE RELAPSE.,"Fix'd as a sentinel, all eye, all ear,"
4378,THE RELAPSE.,All expectation of the coming foe.                                 890
4379,THE RELAPSE.,"Rouse, stand in arms, nor lean against thy spear;"
4380,THE RELAPSE.,"Lest slumber steal one moment o'er thy soul,"
4381,THE RELAPSE.,"And Fate surprise thee nodding. Watch, be strong:"
4382,THE RELAPSE.,"Thus give each day the merit, and renown,"
4383,THE RELAPSE.,Of dying well; though doom'd but once to die.
4384,THE RELAPSE.,Nor let life's period hidden (as from most)
4385,THE RELAPSE.,Hide too from thee the precious use of life.
4386,THE RELAPSE.,"Early, not sudden, was Narcissa's fate.                          898"
4387,THE RELAPSE.,"Soon, not surprising, Death his visit paid."
4388,THE RELAPSE.,"Her thought went forth to meet him on his way,"
4389,THE RELAPSE.,Nor gaiety forgot it was to die:
4390,THE RELAPSE.,"Though Fortune too (our third and final theme),"
4391,THE RELAPSE.,"As an accomplice, play'd her gaudy plumes,"
4392,THE RELAPSE.,"And every glittering gewgaw, on her sight,                         904"
4393,THE RELAPSE.,"To dazzle, and debauch it from its mark."
4394,THE RELAPSE.,Death's dreadful advent is the mark of man;
4395,THE RELAPSE.,"And every thought that misses it, is blind."
4396,THE RELAPSE.,"Fortune, with youth and gaiety, conspired"
4397,THE RELAPSE.,To weave a triple wreath of happiness
4398,THE RELAPSE.,(If happiness on earth) to crown her brow.                         910
4399,THE RELAPSE.,And could Death charge through such a shining shield?
4400,THE RELAPSE.,That shining shield invites the tyrant's spear.
4401,THE RELAPSE.,"As if to damp our elevated aims,"
4402,THE RELAPSE.,And strongly preach humility to man.
4403,THE RELAPSE.,O how portentous is prosperity!
4404,THE RELAPSE.,"How, comet-like, it threatens, while it shines!"
4405,THE RELAPSE.,"Few years but yield us proof of Death's ambition,"
4406,THE RELAPSE.,"To cull his victims from the fairest fold,"
4407,THE RELAPSE.,And sheath his shafts in all the pride of life.
4408,THE RELAPSE.,"When flooded with abundance, purpled o'er                          920"
4409,THE RELAPSE.,"With recent honours, bloom'd with every bliss,"
4410,THE RELAPSE.,"Set up in ostentation, made the gaze,"
4411,THE RELAPSE.,"The gaudy centre, of the public eye,"
4412,THE RELAPSE.,"When Fortune thus has toss'd her child in air,"
4413,THE RELAPSE.,"Snatch'd from the covert of an humble state,"
4414,THE RELAPSE.,"How often have I seen him dropp'd at once,"
4415,THE RELAPSE.,Our morning's envy! and our evening's sigh!
4416,THE RELAPSE.,"As if her bounties were the signal given,"
4417,THE RELAPSE.,"The flowery wreath to mark the sacrifice,"
4418,THE RELAPSE.,And call Death's arrows on the destined prey.                      930
4419,THE RELAPSE.,High Fortune seems in cruel league with Fate.
4420,THE RELAPSE.,Ask you for what? To give his war on man                           932
4421,THE RELAPSE.,"The deeper dread, and more illustrious spoil;"
4422,THE RELAPSE.,Thus to keep daring mortals more in awe.
4423,THE RELAPSE.,And burns Lorenzo still for the sublime
4424,THE RELAPSE.,"Of life? to hang his airy nest on high,"
4425,THE RELAPSE.,"On the slight timber of the topmost bough,"
4426,THE RELAPSE.,"Rock'd at each breeze, and menacing a fall?"
4427,THE RELAPSE.,Granting grim Death at equal distance there;
4428,THE RELAPSE.,Yet peace begins just where ambition ends.                         940
4429,THE RELAPSE.,What makes man wretched? Happiness denied?
4430,THE RELAPSE.,Lorenzo! no: 'tis happiness disdain'd.
4431,THE RELAPSE.,She comes too meanly dress'd to win our smile;
4432,THE RELAPSE.,"And calls herself Content, a homely name!"
4433,THE RELAPSE.,"Our flame is transport, and Content our scorn."
4434,THE RELAPSE.,"Ambition turns, and shuts the door against her,"
4435,THE RELAPSE.,"And weds a toil, a tempest, in her stead;"
4436,THE RELAPSE.,A tempest to warm transport near of kin.
4437,THE RELAPSE.,"Unknowing what our mortal state admits,"
4438,THE RELAPSE.,"Life's modest joys we ruin, while we raise;                        950"
4439,THE RELAPSE.,And all our ecstasies are wounds to peace;
4440,THE RELAPSE.,"Peace, the full portion of mankind below."
4441,THE RELAPSE.,"And since thy peace is dear, ambitious youth!"
4442,THE RELAPSE.,Of fortune fond! as thoughtless of thy fate!
4443,THE RELAPSE.,"As late I drew Death's picture, to stir up"
4444,THE RELAPSE.,"Thy wholesome fears; now, drawn in contrast, see"
4445,THE RELAPSE.,"Gay Fortune's, thy vain hopes to reprimand."
4446,THE RELAPSE.,"See, high in air, the sportive goddess hangs,"
4447,THE RELAPSE.,"Unlocks her casket, spreads her glittering ware,"
4448,THE RELAPSE.,And calls the giddy winds to puff abroad                           960
4449,THE RELAPSE.,Her random bounties o'er the gaping throng.
4450,THE RELAPSE.,All rush rapacious; friends o'er trodden friends;
4451,THE RELAPSE.,"Sons o'er their fathers, subjects o'er their kings,"
4452,THE RELAPSE.,"Priests o'er their gods, and lovers o'er the fair"
4453,THE RELAPSE.,"(Still more adored), to snatch the golden shower."
4454,THE RELAPSE.,"Gold glitters most, where virtue shines no more;"
4455,THE RELAPSE.,As stars from absent suns have leave to shine.                     967
4456,THE RELAPSE.,O what a precious pack of votaries[26]
4457,THE RELAPSE.,"Unkennell'd from the prisons, and the stews,"
4458,THE RELAPSE.,"Pour in, all opening in their idol's praise;"
4459,THE RELAPSE.,"All, ardent, eye each wafture of her hand,"
4460,THE RELAPSE.,"And, wide-expanding their voracious jaws,"
4461,THE RELAPSE.,"Morsel on morsel swallow down unchew'd,                            973"
4462,THE RELAPSE.,"Untasted, through mad appetite for more;"
4463,THE RELAPSE.,"Gorged to the throat, yet lean and ravenous still."
4464,THE RELAPSE.,"Sagacious all, to trace the smallest game,"
4465,THE RELAPSE.,And bold to seize the greatest. If (bless'd chance!)
4466,THE RELAPSE.,"Court-zephyrs sweetly breathe, they launch, they fly,"
4467,THE RELAPSE.,"O'er just, o'er sacred, all-forbidden ground,"
4468,THE RELAPSE.,"Drunk with the burning scent of place or power,                    980"
4469,THE RELAPSE.,"Staunch to the foot of lucre, till they die."
4470,THE RELAPSE.,"Or, if for men you take them, as I mark"
4471,THE RELAPSE.,"Their manners, thou their various fates survey."
4472,THE RELAPSE.,"With aim mismeasured, and impetuous speed,"
4473,THE RELAPSE.,"Some darting, strike their ardent wish far off,"
4474,THE RELAPSE.,"Through fury to possess it: some succeed,"
4475,THE RELAPSE.,"But stumble, and let fall the taken prize."
4476,THE RELAPSE.,"From some, by sudden blasts, 'tis whirl'd away,"
4477,THE RELAPSE.,And lodged in bosoms that ne'er dreamt of gain.
4478,THE RELAPSE.,"To some it sticks so close, that, when torn off,                   990"
4479,THE RELAPSE.,"Torn is the man, and mortal is the wound."
4480,THE RELAPSE.,"Some, o'er-enamour'd of their bags, run mad,"
4481,THE RELAPSE.,"Groan under gold, yet weep for want of bread."
4482,THE RELAPSE.,"Together some (unhappy rivals!) seize,"
4483,THE RELAPSE.,And rend abundance into poverty;
4484,THE RELAPSE.,"Loud croaks the raven of the law, and smiles:"
4485,THE RELAPSE.,Smiles too the goddess; but smiles most at those
4486,THE RELAPSE.,(Just victims of exorbitant desire!)
4487,THE RELAPSE.,"Who perish at their own request, and, whelm'd"
4488,THE RELAPSE.,"Beneath her load of lavish grants, expire.                        1000"
4489,THE RELAPSE.,"Fortune is famous for her numbers slain,"
4490,THE RELAPSE.,"The number small, which happiness can bear.                       1002"
4491,THE RELAPSE.,Though various for a while their fates; at last
4492,THE RELAPSE.,"One curse involves them all: at Death's approach,"
4493,THE RELAPSE.,"All read their riches backward into loss,"
4494,THE RELAPSE.,"And mourn, in just proportion to their store."
4495,THE RELAPSE.,And Death's approach (if orthodox my song)
4496,THE RELAPSE.,Is hasten'd by the lure of Fortune's smiles.
4497,THE RELAPSE.,And art thou still a glutton of bright gold?
4498,THE RELAPSE.,And art thou still rapacious of thy ruin?                         1010
4499,THE RELAPSE.,"Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow;"
4500,THE RELAPSE.,"A blow, which, while it executes, alarms;"
4501,THE RELAPSE.,And startles thousands with a single fall.
4502,THE RELAPSE.,"As when some stately growth of oak, or pine,"
4503,THE RELAPSE.,"Which nods aloft, and proudly spreads her shade,"
4504,THE RELAPSE.,"The sun's defiance, and the flock's defence;"
4505,THE RELAPSE.,"By the strong strokes of labouring hinds subdued,"
4506,THE RELAPSE.,"Loud groans her last, and, rushing from her height,"
4507,THE RELAPSE.,"In cumbrous ruin, thunders to the ground:"
4508,THE RELAPSE.,"The conscious forest trembles at the shock,                       1020"
4509,THE RELAPSE.,"And hill, and stream, and distant dale, resound."
4510,THE RELAPSE.,"These high-aim'd darts of Death, and these alone,"
4511,THE RELAPSE.,"Should I collect, my quiver would be full."
4512,THE RELAPSE.,"A quiver, which, suspended in mid-air,"
4513,THE RELAPSE.,"Or near heaven's archer, in the zodiac, hung,"
4514,THE RELAPSE.,"(So could it be) should draw the public eye,"
4515,THE RELAPSE.,The gaze and contemplation of mankind!
4516,THE RELAPSE.,"A constellation awful, yet benign,"
4517,THE RELAPSE.,To guide the gay through life's tempestuous wave;
4518,THE RELAPSE.,"Nor suffer them to strike the common rock,                        1030"
4519,THE RELAPSE.,"""From greater danger to grow more secure,"
4520,THE RELAPSE.,"And, wrapt in happiness, forget their fate."""

4524,THE RELAPSE.,"In youth, form, fortune, fame, they both were bless'd:"

4526,THE RELAPSE.,Can fancy form more finish'd happiness?
4527,THE RELAPSE.,Fix'd was the nuptial hour. Her stately dome
4528,THE RELAPSE.,Rose on the sounding beach. The glittering spires
4529,THE RELAPSE.,"Float in the wave, and break against the shore:"
4530,THE RELAPSE.,"So break those glittering shadows, human joys."

4534,THE RELAPSE.,"Untold, she saw it in her servant's eye."

4536,THE RELAPSE.,"And, drown'd, without the furious ocean's aid,"
4537,THE RELAPSE.,"In suffocating sorrows, shares his tomb."

4539,THE RELAPSE.,The guilty billows innocently roar;
4540,THE RELAPSE.,"And the rough sailor passing, drops a tear."
4541,THE RELAPSE.,A tear?--can tears suffice?--But not for me.
4542,THE RELAPSE.,"How vain our efforts! and our arts, how vain!"
4543,THE RELAPSE.,"The distant train of thought I took, to shun,"
4544,THE RELAPSE.,Has thrown me on my fate--these died together;

4547,THE RELAPSE.,Narcissa! pity bleeds at thought of thee.

4585,PREFACE.,
4586,PREFACE.,
4587,PREFACE.,Few ages have been deeper in dispute about religion than this. The
4588,PREFACE.,"dispute about religion, and the practice of it, seldom go together. The"
4589,PREFACE.,"shorter, therefore, the dispute, the better. I think it may be reduced to"
4590,PREFACE.,"this single question, _Is man immortal, or is he not?_ If he is not, all"
4591,PREFACE.,"our disputes are mere amusements, or trials of skill. In this case,"
4592,PREFACE.,"truth, reason, religion, which give our discourses such pomp and"
4593,PREFACE.,"solemnity, are (as will be shown) mere empty sound, without any meaning"
4594,PREFACE.,"in them. But if man is immortal, it will behove him to be very serious"
4595,PREFACE.,"about eternal consequences; or, in other words, to be truly religious."
4596,PREFACE.,"And this great fundamental truth, unestablished, or unawakened in the"
4597,PREFACE.,"minds of men, is, I conceive, the real source and support of all our"
4598,PREFACE.,infidelity; how remote soever the particular objections advanced may seem
4599,PREFACE.,to be from it.
4600,PREFACE.,
4601,PREFACE.,Sensible appearances affect most men much more than abstract reasonings;
4602,PREFACE.,"and we daily see bodies drop around us, but the soul is invisible. The"
4603,PREFACE.,"power which inclination has over the judgment, is greater than can be"
4604,PREFACE.,well conceived by those that have not had an experience of it; and of
4605,PREFACE.,what numbers is it the sad interest that souls should not survive! The
4606,PREFACE.,"heathen world confessed, that they rather hoped, than firmly believed,"
4607,PREFACE.,immortality; and how many heathens have we still amongst us! The sacred
4608,PREFACE.,"page assures us, that life and immortality are brought to light by the"
4609,PREFACE.,Gospel: but by how many is the Gospel rejected or overlooked? From these
4610,PREFACE.,"considerations, and from my being accidentally privy to the sentiments of"
4611,PREFACE.,"some particular persons, I have been long persuaded that most, if not"
4612,PREFACE.,"all, our infidels (whatever name they take, and whatever scheme, for"
4613,PREFACE.,"argument's sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronise),"
4614,PREFACE.,"are supported in their deplorable error, by some doubt of their"
4615,PREFACE.,"immortality, at the bottom. And I am satisfied, that men once thoroughly"
4616,PREFACE.,"convinced of their immortality, are not far from being Christians. For it"
4617,PREFACE.,"is hard to conceive, that a man fully conscious eternal pain or happiness"
4618,PREFACE.,"will certainly be his lot, should not earnestly and impartially inquire"
4619,PREFACE.,"after the surest means of escaping the one, and securing the other. And"
4620,PREFACE.,of such an earnest and impartial inquiry I well know the consequence.
4621,PREFACE.,
4622,PREFACE.,"Here, therefore, in proof of this most fundamental truth, some plain"
4623,PREFACE.,arguments are offered; arguments derived from principles which infidels
4624,PREFACE.,admit in common with believers; arguments which appear to me altogether
4625,PREFACE.,"irresistible; and such as, I am satisfied, will have great weight with"
4626,PREFACE.,all who give themselves the small trouble of looking seriously into their
4627,PREFACE.,"own bosoms, and of observing, with any tolerable degree of attention,"
4628,PREFACE.,what daily passes round about them in the world. If some arguments shall
4629,PREFACE.,"here occur, which others have declined, they are submitted, with all"
4630,PREFACE.,"deference, to better judgments in this, of all points the most important."
4631,PREFACE.,"For, as to the being of a God, that is no longer disputed; but it is"
4632,PREFACE.,"undisputed for this reason only, viz., because, where the least pretence"
4633,PREFACE.,"to reason is admitted, it must for ever be indisputable. And of"
4634,PREFACE.,consequence no man can be betrayed into a dispute of that nature by
4635,PREFACE.,vanity; which has a principal share in animating our modern combatants
4636,PREFACE.,against other articles of our belief.

4869,PART I.,Hard-travell'd from the cradle to the grave.
4870,PART I.,How low the wretches stoop! how steep they climb!
4871,PART I.,These demons burn mankind; but most possess
4872,PART I.,"Lorenzo's bosom, and turn out the skies."
4873,PART I.,Is it in time to hide eternity?
4874,PART I.,And why not in an atom on the shore

4876,PART I.,Glory and wealth! have they this blinding power?                   230
4877,PART I.,What if to them I prove Lorenzo blind?
4878,PART I.,Would it surprise thee? Be thou then surprised;

4880,PART I.,"Mark well, as foreign as these subjects seem,"
4881,PART I.,What close connexion ties them to my theme.
4882,PART I.,"First, what is true ambition? The pursuit"

4884,PART I.,"Were they as vain, as gaudy-minded man,"
4885,PART I.,"As flatulent with fumes of self-applause,"

4889,PART I.,"As in our form, distinct, pre-eminent;"
4890,PART I.,"If prone in thought, our stature is our shame;"
4891,PART I.,"And man should blush, his forehead meets the skies."

4897,PART I.,"When the great soul buoys up to this high point,"

4902,PART I.,This is ambition: this is human fire.

4904,PART I.,"Lorenzo great, and pluck him from the throng?"
4905,PART I.,"Genius and Art, ambition's boasted wings,"
4906,PART I.,Our boast but ill deserve. A feeble aid!
4907,PART I.,Dedalian enginery! If these alone
4908,PART I.,"Assist our flight, Fame's flight is Glory's fall."
4909,PART I.,"Heart merit wanting, mount we ne'er so high,                       263"
4910,PART I.,Our height is but the gibbet of our name.
4911,PART I.,"A celebrated wretch, when I behold,"

4922,PART I.,"Illustrious, and give infamy renown."
4923,PART I.,Great ill is an achievement of great powers.
4924,PART I.,Plain sense but rarely leads us far astray.

4927,PART I.,"If wrong our hearts, our heads are right in vain:"
4928,PART I.,"What is a Pelham's head, to Pelham's heart?"
4929,PART I.,Hearts are proprietors of all applause.
4930,PART I.,"Right ends, and means, make wisdom: worldly-wise"
4931,PART I.,"Is but half-witted, at its highest praise."
4932,PART I.,Let Genius then despair to make thee great;

4934,PART I.,"'Tis a proud mendicant; it boasts, and begs;"
4935,PART I.,"It begs an alms of homage from the throng,                         289"
4936,PART I.,And oft the throng denies its charity.
4937,PART I.,"Monarchs and ministers, are awful names;"
4938,PART I.,"Whoever wear them, challenge our devoir."
4939,PART I.,"Religion, public order, both exact"

4949,PART I.,Let the small savage boast his silver fur;
4950,PART I.,"His royal robe unborrow'd, and unbought,"
4951,PART I.,"His own, descending fairly from his sires."
4952,PART I.,"Shall man be proud to wear his livery,"

4954,PART I.,"Can place or lessen us, or aggrandize?"
4955,PART I.,"Pigmies are pigmies still, though perch'd on Alps;"
4956,PART I.,And pyramids are pyramids in vales.                                310
4957,PART I.,"Each man makes his own stature, builds himself:"
4958,PART I.,Virtue alone outbuilds the pyramids:
4959,PART I.,"Her monuments shall last, when Egypt's fall."
4960,PART I.,Of these sure truths dost thou demand the cause?
4961,PART I.,The cause is lodged in immortality.
4962,PART I.,"Hear, and assent. Thy bosom burns for power;"
4963,PART I.,What station charms thee? I'll install thee there;
4964,PART I.,'Tis thine. And art thou greater than before?
4965,PART I.,Then thou before wast something less than man.
4966,PART I.,Has thy new post betray'd thee into pride?                         320
4967,PART I.,That treacherous pride betrays thy dignity;
4968,PART I.,"That pride defames humanity, and calls"
4969,PART I.,"The being mean, which staffs or strings can raise.                 323"
4970,PART I.,"That pride, like hooded hawks, in darkness soars,"
4971,PART I.,"From blindness bold, and towering to the skies."
4972,PART I.,"'Tis born of ignorance, which knows not man:"
4973,PART I.,"An angel's second; nor his second, long."
4974,PART I.,"A Nero quitting his imperial throne,"

4978,PART I.,"If nobler motives minister no cure,"
4979,PART I.,Even vanity forbids thee to be vain.
4980,PART I.,High worth is elevated place: 'tis more;

4982,PART I.,"Makes more than monarchs, makes an honest man;"
4983,PART I.,"Though no exchequer it commands, 'tis wealth;"

4987,PART I.,Other ambition Nature interdicts;
4988,PART I.,"Nature proclaims it most absurd in man,"

4994,PART I.,"Of just ambition, to the grand result,"

4997,PART I.,"Reduced to his own stature, low or high,"

5001,PART I.,"Where dwarfs are often stilted, and betray"
5002,PART I.,"A littleness of soul by worlds o'errun,"
5003,PART I.,And nations laid in blood. Dread sacrifice                         357
5004,PART I.,To Christian pride! which had with horror shock'd
5005,PART I.,"The darkest Pagans, offer'd to their gods."

5019,PART I.,"That friend consulted, flatteries apart,"
5020,PART I.,"Will tell thee fair, if thou art great, or mean."
5021,PART I.,"To doat on aught may leave us, or be left,"

5025,PART I.,Which boasts her lineage from celestial fire.
5026,PART I.,"Yet these are they, the world pronounces wise;                     380"
5027,PART I.,"The world, which cancels nature's right and wrong,"

5029,PART I.,"His solemn face, to countenance the coin."
5030,PART I.,Wisdom for parts is madness for the whole.

5197,PART I.,Proud youth! fastidious of the lower world!
5198,PART I.,Man's lawful pride includes humility;
5199,PART I.,Stoops to the lowest; is too great to find

5201,PART I.,Proprietors eternal of thy love.
5202,PART I.,"Immortal! What can strike the sense so strong,"
5203,PART I.,As this the soul? It thunders to the thought;
5204,PART I.,Reason amazes; gratitude o'erwhelms;                               558
5205,PART I.,No more we slumber on the brink of fate;
5206,PART I.,"Roused at the sound, th' exulting soul ascends,"

5209,PART I.,Quick kindles all that is divine within us;
5210,PART I.,Nor leaves one loitering thought beneath the stars.

5214,PART I.,"Because 'tis common, is the blessing lost?"

5216,PART I.,"Oh, vain, vain, vain, all else! Eternity!"
5217,PART I.,"A glorious and a needful refuge, that,"

5224,PART I.,"Their terror those, and these their lustre lose;"
5225,PART I.,Eternity depending covers all;
5226,PART I.,Eternity depending all achieves;                                   580
5227,PART I.,Sets earth at distance; casts her into shades;
5228,PART I.,Blends her distinctions; abrogates her powers;
5229,PART I.,"The low, the lofty, joyous, and severe,"
5230,PART I.,"Fortune's dread frowns, and fascinating smiles,"
5231,PART I.,"Make one promiscuous and neglected heap,"
5232,PART I.,"The man beneath; if I may call him man,"
5233,PART I.,Whom immortality's full force inspires.
5234,PART I.,Nothing terrestrial touches his high thought;

5239,PART I.,"Warm on the wing, in glorious absence lost!"
5240,PART I.,Doubt you this truth? Why labours your belief?
5241,PART I.,If earth's whole orb by some due distanced eye
5242,PART I.,"Were seen at once, her towering Alps would sink,"
5243,PART I.,And levell'd Atlas leave an even sphere.
5244,PART I.,"Thus earth, and all that earthly minds admire,"
5245,PART I.,Is swallow'd in eternity's vast round.
5246,PART I.,"To that stupendous view, when souls awake,                         600"
5247,PART I.,"So large of late, so mountainous to man,"
5248,PART I.,Time's toys subside; and equal all below.

5257,PART I.,"Expects an empire? He forgets his chain,"
5258,PART I.,"And, throned in thought, his absent sceptre waves."
5259,PART I.,And what a sceptre waits us! what a throne!
5260,PART I.,"Her own immense appointments to compute,"
5261,PART I.,"Or comprehend her high prerogatives,"
5262,PART I.,"In this her dark minority, how toils,"
5263,PART I.,"How vainly pants, the human soul divine!"
5264,PART I.,Too great the bounty seems for earthly joy;

5266,PART I.,"In spite of all the truths the Muse has sung,                    620"
5267,PART I.,Ne'er to be prized enough! enough revolved!

5483,PREFACE.,"As we are at war with the power, it were well if we were at war with the"
5484,PREFACE.,"manners, of France. A land of levity is a land of guilt. A serious mind"
5485,PREFACE.,is the native soil of every virtue; and the single character that does
5486,PREFACE.,true honour to mankind. The soul's immortality has been the favourite
5487,PREFACE.,theme with the serious of all ages. Nor is it strange: it is a subject by
5488,PREFACE.,far the most interesting and important that can enter the mind of man. Of
5489,PREFACE.,"highest moment this subject always was, and always will be. Yet this its"
5490,PREFACE.,"highest moment seems to admit of increase, at this day; a sort of"
5491,PREFACE.,occasional importance is superadded to the natural weight of it; if that
5492,PREFACE.,opinion which is advanced in the Preface to the preceding Night be just.
5493,PREFACE.,"It is there supposed, that all our infidels, whatever scheme, for"
5494,PREFACE.,"argument's sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronise,"
5495,PREFACE.,"are betrayed into their deplorable error, by some doubts of their"
5496,PREFACE.,"immortality, at the bottom. And the more I consider this point, the more"
5497,PREFACE.,I am persuaded of the truth of that opinion. Though the distrust of a
5498,PREFACE.,futurity is a strange error; yet it is an error into which bad men may
5499,PREFACE.,naturally be distressed. For it is impossible to bid defiance to final
5500,PREFACE.,"ruin, without some refuge in imagination, some presumption of escape. And"
5501,PREFACE.,"what presumption is there? There are but two in nature; but two, within"
5502,PREFACE.,"the compass of human thought. And these are,--That either God will not,"
5503,PREFACE.,"or can not, punish. Considering the divine attributes, the first is too"
5504,PREFACE.,gross to be digested by our strongest wishes. And since omnipotence is as
5505,PREFACE.,"much a divine attribute as holiness, that God cannot punish, is as absurd"
5506,PREFACE.,a supposition as the former. God certainly can punish as long as wicked
5507,PREFACE.,"men exist. In non-existence, therefore, is their only refuge; and,"
5508,PREFACE.,"consequently, non-existence is their strongest wish. And strong wishes"
5509,PREFACE.,have a strange influence on our opinions; they bias the judgment in a
5510,PREFACE.,"manner almost incredible. And since on this member of their alternative,"
5511,PREFACE.,"there are some very small appearances in their favour, and none at all on"
5512,PREFACE.,"the other, they catch at this reed, they lay hold on this chimera, to"
5513,PREFACE.,save themselves from the shock and horror of an immediate and absolute
5514,PREFACE.,despair.
5515,PREFACE.,
5516,PREFACE.,"On reviewing my subject, by the light which this argument, and others of"
5517,PREFACE.,"like tendency, threw upon it, I was more inclined than ever to pursue it,"
5518,PREFACE.,as it appeared to me to strike directly at the main root of all our
5519,PREFACE.,"infidelity. In the following pages it is, accordingly, pursued at large;"
5520,PREFACE.,"and some arguments for immortality, new at least to me, are ventured on"
5521,PREFACE.,in them. There also the writer has made an attempt to set the gross
5522,PREFACE.,absurdities and horrors of annihilation in a fuller and more affecting
5523,PREFACE.,view than is (I think) to be met with elsewhere.
5524,PREFACE.,
5525,PREFACE.,"The gentlemen, for whose sake this attempt was chiefly made, profess"
5526,PREFACE.,great admiration for the wisdom of heathen antiquity: what pity it is
5527,PREFACE.,"they are not sincere! If they were sincere, how would it mortify them to"
5528,PREFACE.,"consider, with what contempt and abhorrence their notions would have been"
5529,PREFACE.,received by those whom they so much admire! What degree of contempt and
5530,PREFACE.,"abhorrence would fall to their share, may be conjectured by the following"
5531,PREFACE.,matter of fact (in my opinion) extremely memorable. Of all their heathen
5532,PREFACE.,"worthies, Socrates (it is well known) was the most guarded,"
5533,PREFACE.,"dispassionate, and composed: yet this great master of temper was angry;"
5534,PREFACE.,and angry at his last hour; and angry with his friend; and angry for what
5535,PREFACE.,deserved acknowledgment; angry for a right and tender instance of true
5536,PREFACE.,friendship towards him. Is not this surprising? What could be the cause?
5537,PREFACE.,"The cause was for his honour; it was a truly noble, though, perhaps, a"
5538,PREFACE.,"too punctilious, regard for immortality. For his friend asking him, with"
5539,PREFACE.,"such an affectionate concern as became a friend, ""where he should deposit"
5540,PREFACE.,"his remains,"" it was resented by Socrates, as implying a dishonourable"
5541,PREFACE.,"supposition, that he could be so mean, as to have a regard for anything,"
5542,PREFACE.,"even in himself, that was not immortal."
5543,PREFACE.,
5544,PREFACE.,"This fact well considered, would make our infidels withdraw their"
5545,PREFACE.,"admiration from Socrates; or make them endeavour, by their imitation of"
5546,PREFACE.,"this illustrious example, to share his glory: and, consequently, it would"
5547,PREFACE.,incline them to peruse the following pages with candour and impartiality;
5548,PREFACE.,"which is all I desire; and that, for their sakes: for I am persuaded,"
5549,PREFACE.,"that an unprejudiced infidel must, necessarily, receive some advantageous"
5550,PREFACE.,impressions from them.

6011,CONTENTS.,Thirst of applause is Virtue's second guard;
6012,CONTENTS.,"Reason, her first; but reason wants an aid;"
6013,CONTENTS.,Our private reason is a flatterer;
6014,CONTENTS.,"Thirst of applause calls public judgment in,"

6052,CONTENTS.,And avarice is a virtue most divine.
6053,CONTENTS.,Is faith a refuge for our happiness?
6054,CONTENTS.,Most sure: and is it not for reason too?
6055,CONTENTS.,"Nothing this world unriddles, but the next."

6070,CONTENTS.,To Pleasure never was Lorenzo deaf;
6071,CONTENTS.,"Then hear her now, now first thy real friend."
6072,CONTENTS.,Since Nature made us not more fond than proud
6073,CONTENTS.,Of happiness (whence hypocrites in joy!
6074,CONTENTS.,"Makers of mirth! artificers of smiles!),"
6075,CONTENTS.,"Why should the joy most poignant sense affords,"
6076,CONTENTS.,"Burn us with blushes, and rebuke our pride?--"

7746,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Through Eden, as Euphrates ran, it runs,"
7747,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And fosters every growth of happy life;
7748,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Makes a new Eden where it flows;--but such
7749,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"As must be lost, Lorenzo! by thy fall."
7750,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""What mean I by thy fall?""--Thou'lt shortly see,"
7751,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,While Pleasure's nature is at large display'd;                     661
7752,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Already sung her origin, and ends."
7753,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Those glorious ends, by kind, or by degree,"
7754,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"When Pleasure violates, 'tis then a vice,"
7755,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A vengeance too; it hastens into pain.
7756,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From due refreshment, life, health, reason, joy;"
7757,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From wild excess, pain, grief, distraction, death;"
7758,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Heaven's justice this proclaims, and that her love."
7759,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What greater evil can I wish my foe,"
7760,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Than his full draught of pleasure, from a cask                     670"
7761,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Unbroach'd by just authority, ungauged"
7762,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"By temperance, by reason unrefined?"
7763,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A thousand demons lurk within the lee.
7764,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Heaven, others, and ourselves! uninjured these,"
7765,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Drink deep; the deeper, then, the more divine;"
7766,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Angels are angels, from indulgence there;"
7767,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,'Tis unrepenting pleasure makes a god.
7768,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Dost think thyself a god from other joys?
7769,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A victim rather! shortly sure to bleed.
7770,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The wrong must mourn: can Heaven's appointments fail?
7771,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Can man outwit Omnipotence? strike out                             681
7772,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A self-wrought happiness unmeant by Him
7773,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who made us, and the world we would enjoy?"
7774,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who forms an instrument, ordains from whence"
7775,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Its dissonance, or harmony, shall rise."
7776,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Heaven bid the soul this mortal frame inspire!
7777,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Bid virtue's ray divine inspire the soul
7778,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,With unprecarious flows of vital joy;
7779,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And, without breathing, man as well might hope"
7780,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"For life, as, without piety, for peace.                            690"
7781,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""Is virtue, then, and piety the same?""--"
7782,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,No; piety is more; 'tis virtue's source;
7783,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Mother of every worth, as that of joy."
7784,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Men of the world this doctrine ill digest;
7785,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,They smile at piety; yet boast aloud                               695
7786,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Good will to men; nor know they strive to part
7787,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,What Nature joins; and thus confute themselves.
7788,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,With piety begins all good on earth;
7789,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,'Tis the first-born of rationality.
7790,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Conscience, her first law broken, wounded lies;"
7791,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Enfeebled, lifeless, impotent to good;"
7792,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A feign'd affection bounds her utmost power.                       702
7793,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Some we can't love, but for th' Almighty's sake;"
7794,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A foe to God was ne'er true friend to man;
7795,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Some sinister intent taints all he does;
7796,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And, in his kindest actions, he's unkind."
7797,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"On piety, humanity is built;"
7798,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And, on humanity, much happiness;"
7799,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And yet still more on piety itself.
7800,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A soul in commerce with her God, is heaven;                        710"
7801,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Feels not the tumults and the shocks of life;
7802,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The whirls of passions, and the strokes of heart."
7803,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A Deity believed, is joy begun;"
7804,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A Deity adored, is joy advanced;"
7805,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A Deity beloved, is joy matured."
7806,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Each branch of piety delight inspires;
7807,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Faith builds a bridge from this world to the next,"
7808,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"O'er death's dark gulf, and all its horror hides;"
7809,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Praise, the sweet exhalation of our joy,"
7810,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That joy exalts, and makes it sweeter still;                       720"
7811,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Prayer ardent opens heaven, lets down a stream"
7812,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Of glory on the consecrated hour
7813,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of man, in audience with the Deity."
7814,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who worships the great God, that instant joins"
7815,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The first in heaven, and sets his foot on hell."
7816,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Lorenzo! when wast thou at church before?
7817,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Thou think'st the service long: but is it just?
7818,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Though just, unwelcome: thou hadst rather tread"
7819,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Unhallow'd ground; the Muse, to win thine ear,                     729"
7820,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Must take an air less solemn. She complies.
7821,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Good conscience! at the sound the world retires;
7822,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Verse disaffects it, and Lorenzo smiles:"
7823,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Yet has she her seraglio full of charms;
7824,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And such as age shall heighten, not impair."
7825,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Art thou dejected? Is thy mind o'ercast?
7826,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Amid her fair ones, thou the fairest choose,"
7827,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To chase thy gloom.--""Go, fix some weighty truth;"
7828,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Chain down some passion; do some generous good;
7829,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Teach ignorance to see, or grief to smile;"
7830,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Correct thy friend; befriend thy greatest foe;                     740
7831,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Or with warm heart, and confidence divine,"
7832,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Spring up, and lay strong hold on Him who made thee."""
7833,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thy gloom is scatter'd, sprightly spirits flow;"
7834,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Though wither'd is thy vine, and harp unstrung."
7835,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Dost call the bowl, the viol, and the dance,"
7836,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Loud mirth, mad laughter? Wretched comforters!"
7837,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Physicians! more than half of thy disease.
7838,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Laughter, though never censured yet as sin"
7839,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"(Pardon a thought that only seems severe),"
7840,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Is half immoral: Is it much indulged?                              750
7841,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"By venting spleen, or dissipating thought,"
7842,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"It shows a scorner, or it makes a fool;"
7843,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And sins, as hurting others, or ourselves."
7844,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"'Tis pride, or emptiness, applies the straw,"
7845,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,That tickles little minds to mirth effuse;
7846,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of grief approaching, the portentous sign!"
7847,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The house of laughter makes a house of woe.
7848,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A man triumphant is a monstrous sight;
7849,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A man dejected is a sight as mean.
7850,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What cause for triumph, where such ills abound?                    760"
7851,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What for dejection, where presides a Power,"
7852,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Who call'd us into being to be bless'd?
7853,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"So grieve, as conscious, grief may rise to joy;                    763"
7854,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"So joy, as conscious, joy to grief may fall."
7855,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Most true, a wise man never will be sad;"
7856,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But neither will sonorous, bubbling mirth,"
7857,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A shallow stream of happiness betray:
7858,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Too happy to be sportive, he's serene."
7859,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Yet would'st thou laugh (but at thy own expense),"
7860,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,This counsel strange should I presume to give--                    770
7861,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""Retire, and read thy Bible, to be gay."""
7862,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,There truths abound of sovereign aid to peace;
7863,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Ah! do not prize them less, because inspired,"
7864,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"As thou, and thine, are apt and proud to do."
7865,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"If not inspired, that pregnant page had stood,"
7866,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Time's treasure, and the wonder of the wise!"
7867,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thou think'st, perhaps, thy soul alone at stake;"
7868,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Alas!--should men mistake thee for a fool;--
7869,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What man of taste for genius, wisdom, truth,"
7870,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Though tender of thy fame, could interpose?                        780"
7871,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Believe me, sense here acts a double part,"
7872,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And the true critic is a Christian too.
7873,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But these, thou think'st, are gloomy paths to joy.--"
7874,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,True joy in sunshine ne'er was found at first;
7875,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"They, first, themselves offend, who greatly please;"
7876,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And travel only gives us sound repose.
7877,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Heaven sells all pleasure; effort is the price;
7878,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The joys of conquest, are the joys of man;"
7879,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And glory the victorious laurel spreads
7880,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"O'er pleasure's pure, perpetual, placid stream.                    790"
7881,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"There is a time, when toil must be preferr'd,"
7882,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Or joy, by mistimed fondness, is undone."
7883,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A man of pleasure, is a man of pains."
7884,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Thou wilt not take the trouble to be blest.
7885,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"False joys, indeed, are born from want of thought;"
7886,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From thoughts full bent, and energy, the true;"
7887,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And that demands a mind in equal poise,                            797"
7888,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Remote from gloomy grief, and glaring joy."
7889,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Much joy not only speaks small happiness,"
7890,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,But happiness that shortly must expire.
7891,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Can joy, unbottom'd in reflection, stand?"
7892,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And, in a tempest, can reflection live?"
7893,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Can joy, like thine, secure itself an hour?"
7894,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Can joy, like thine, meet accident unshock'd?                      804"
7895,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Or ope the door to honest poverty?
7896,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Or talk with threatening death, and not turn pale?"
7897,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"In such a world, and such a nature, these"
7898,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Are needful fundamentals of delight:
7899,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,These fundamentals give delight indeed;
7900,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Delight, pure, delicate, and durable;                              810"
7901,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Delight, unshaken, masculine, divine;"
7902,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A constant, and a sound, but serious joy."
7903,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Is joy the daughter of severity?
7904,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,It is:--yet far my doctrine from severe.
7905,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""Rejoice for ever:"" it becomes a man;"
7906,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Exalts, and sets him nearer to the gods."
7907,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""Rejoice for ever!"" Nature cries, ""Rejoice!"""
7908,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And drinks to man, in her nectareous cup,"
7909,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Mix'd up of delicates for every sense;
7910,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To the great Founder of the bounteous feast,                       820"
7911,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Drinks glory, gratitude, eternal praise;"
7912,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And he that will not pledge her, is a churl."
7913,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Ill firmly to support, good fully taste,"
7914,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Is the whole science of felicity:
7915,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Yet sparing pledge: her bowl is not the best
7916,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Mankind can boast.--""A rational repast;"
7917,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Exertion, vigilance, a mind in arms,"
7918,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A military discipline of thought,"
7919,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,To foil temptation in the doubtful field;
7920,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And ever-waking ardour for the right.""                             830"
7921,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"'Tis these, first give, then guard, a cheerful heart.              831"
7922,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Nought that is right, think little; well aware,"
7923,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What reason bids, God bids; by His command"
7924,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"How aggrandized, the smallest thing we do!"
7925,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thus, nothing is insipid to the wise;"
7926,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To thee, insipid all, but what is mad;"
7927,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Joys season'd high, and tasting strong of guilt."
7928,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""Mad! (thou reply'st, with indignation fired);"
7929,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of ancient sages proud to tread the steps,"
7930,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"I follow Nature.""--Follow Nature still,                            840"
7931,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But look it be thine own: is Conscience, then,"
7932,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,No part of nature? Is she not supreme?
7933,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thou regicide! Oh, raise her from the dead!"
7934,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Then, follow Nature; and resemble God."
7935,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"When, spite of Conscience, pleasure is pursued,"
7936,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Man's nature is unnaturally pleased:
7937,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And what's unnatural, is painful too"
7938,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"At intervals, and must disgust even thee!"
7939,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The fact thou know'st; but not, perhaps, the cause."
7940,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Virtue's foundations with the world's were laid;                   850
7941,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Heaven mix'd her with our make, and twisted close"
7942,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Her sacred interests with the strings of life.
7943,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who breaks her awful mandate, shocks himself,"
7944,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His better self: and is it greater pain,"
7945,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Our soul should murmur, or our dust repine?"
7946,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And one, in their eternal war, must bleed."
7947,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"If one must suffer, which should least be spared?"
7948,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The pains of mind surpass the pains of sense:
7949,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Ask, then, the gout, what torment is in guilt."
7950,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The joys of sense to mental joys are mean:                         860
7951,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Sense on the present only feeds; the soul
7952,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"On past, and future, forages for joy."
7953,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"'Tis hers, by retrospect, through time to range;"
7954,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And forward time's great sequel to survey.
7955,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Could human courts take vengeance on the mind,                     865"
7956,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Axes might rust, and racks and gibbets fall:"
7957,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Guard, then, thy mind, and leave the rest to fate."
7958,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Lorenzo! wilt thou never be a man?
7959,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The man is dead, who for the body lives,"
7960,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Lured, by the beating of his pulse, to list"
7961,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"With every lust, that wars against his peace;"
7962,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And sets him quite at variance with himself.                       872
7963,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thyself, first, know; then love: a self there is"
7964,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of Virtue fond, that kindles at her charms."
7965,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A self there is, as fond of every vice,"
7966,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,While every virtue wounds it to the heart:
7967,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Humility degrades it, Justice robs,"
7968,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Bless'd Bounty beggars it, fair Truth betrays,"
7969,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And godlike Magnanimity destroys.
7970,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"This self, when rival to the former, scorn;                        880"
7971,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"When not in competition, kindly treat,"
7972,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Defend it, feed it:--but when Virtue bids,"
7973,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Toss it, or to the fowls, or to the flames."
7974,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And why? 'Tis love of pleasure bids thee bleed;
7975,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Comply, or own self-love extinct, or blind."
7976,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,For what is vice? self-love in a mistake:
7977,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A poor blind merchant buying joys too dear.
7978,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And virtue, what? 'tis self-love in her wits,"
7979,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Quite skilful in the market of delight.
7980,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Self-love's good sense is love of that dread Power,                890"
7981,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From whom herself, and all she can enjoy."
7982,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Other self-love is but disguised self-hate;
7983,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,More mortal than the malice of our foes;
7984,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A self-hate, now, scarce felt; then felt full sore,"
7985,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"When being, cursed; extinction, loud implored;"
7986,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And every thing preferr'd to what we are.
7987,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Yet this self-love Lorenzo makes his choice;
7988,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And, in this choice triumphant, boasts of joy."
7989,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"How is his want of happiness betray'd,                             899"
7990,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,By disaffection to the present hour!
7991,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Imagination wanders far afield:
7992,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The future pleases: why? the present pains.--
7993,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""But that's a secret."" Yes, which all men know;"
7994,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And know from thee, discover'd unawares."
7995,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thy ceaseless agitation, restless roll"
7996,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From cheat to cheat, impatient of a pause;"
7997,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What is it?--'tis the cradle of the soul,"
7998,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From Instinct sent, to rock her in disease,"
7999,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Which her physician, Reason, will not cure."
8000,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A poor expedient! yet thy best; and while                          910
8001,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"It mitigates thy pain, it owns it too."
8002,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Such are Lorenzo's wretched remedies!
8003,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The weak have remedies; the wise have joys.
8004,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Superior wisdom is superior bliss.
8005,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And what sure mark distinguishes the wise?
8006,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Consistent wisdom ever wills the same;
8007,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Thy fickle wish is ever on the wing.
8008,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Sick of herself, is Folly's character,"
8009,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"As Wisdom's is, a modest self-applause."
8010,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A change of evils is thy good supreme;                             920
8011,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Nor, but in motion, canst thou find thy rest."
8012,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Man's greatest strength is shown in standing still.
8013,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The first sure symptom of a mind in health,"
8014,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Is rest of heart, and pleasure felt at home."
8015,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,False pleasure from abroad her joys imports;
8016,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Rich from within, and self-sustain'd, the true."
8017,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The true is fix'd, and solid as a rock;"
8018,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Slippery the false, and tossing, as the wave."
8019,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"This, a wild wanderer on earth, like Cain;"
8020,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That, like the fabled, self-enamour'd boy,[48]                     930"
8021,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Home-contemplation her supreme delight;
8022,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"She dreads an interruption from without,                           932"
8023,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Smit with her own condition; and the more
8024,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Intense she gazes, still it charms the more."
8025,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"No man is happy, till he thinks, on earth"
8026,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,There breathes not a more happy than himself:
8027,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Then envy dies, and love o'erflows on all;"
8028,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And love o'erflowing makes an angel here.
8029,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Such angels, all, entitled to repose"
8030,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"On Him who governs fate. Though tempest frowns,                    940"
8031,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Though nature shakes, how soft to lean on Heaven!"
8032,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To lean on Him, on whom archangels lean!"
8033,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"With inward eyes, and silent as the grave,"
8034,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"They stand, collecting every beam of thought,"
8035,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Till their hearts kindle with divine delight:
8036,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"For all their thoughts, like angels, seen of old"
8037,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"In Israel's dream, come from, and go to, heaven."
8038,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Hence are they studious of sequester'd scenes;
8039,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"While noise, and dissipation, comfort thee."
8040,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Were all men happy, revellings would cease,                      950"
8041,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,That opiate for inquietude within.
8042,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Lorenzo! never man was truly blest,"
8043,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But it composed, and gave him such a cast,"
8044,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,As folly might mistake for want of joy.
8045,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A cast, unlike the triumph of the proud;"
8046,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A modest aspect, and a smile at heart."
8047,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,O for a joy from thy Philander's spring!
8048,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A spring perennial, rising in the breast,"
8049,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And permanent, as pure! no turbid stream"
8050,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of rapturous exultation, swelling high;                            960"
8051,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Which, like land floods, impetuous pour a while,"
8052,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Then sink at once, and leave us in the mire."
8053,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What does the man, who transient joy prefers?"
8054,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What, but prefer the bubbles to the stream?"
8055,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Vain are all sudden sallies of delight;
8056,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Convulsions of a weak, distemper'd joy.                            966"
8057,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Joy's a fix'd state; a tenure, not a start."
8058,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Bliss there is none, but unprecarious bliss:"
8059,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That is the gem: sell all, and purchase that."
8060,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Why go a-begging to contingencies,"
8061,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Not gain'd with ease, nor safely loved, if gain'd?"
8062,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"At good fortuitous, draw back, and pause;"
8063,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Suspect it; what thou canst insure, enjoy;                         973"
8064,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And nought but what thou givest thyself, is sure."
8065,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Reason perpetuates joy that Reason gives,"
8066,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And makes it as immortal as herself:
8067,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To mortals, nought immortal, but their worth."
8068,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Worth, conscious worth! should absolutely reign;"
8069,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And other joys ask leave for their approach;
8070,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Nor, unexamined, ever leave obtain.                                980"
8071,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Thou art all anarchy; a mob of joys
8072,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Wage war, and perish in intestine broils;"
8073,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Not the least promise of internal peace!
8074,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"No bosom-comfort, or unborrow'd bliss!"
8075,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thy thoughts are vagabonds; all outward-bound,"
8076,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"'Mid sands, and rocks, and storms, to cruise for pleasure;"
8077,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"If gain'd, dear-bought; and better miss'd than gain'd."
8078,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Much pain must expiate, what much pain procured."
8079,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Fancy, and Sense, from an infected shore,"
8080,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Thy cargo bring; and pestilence the prize.                         990
8081,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Then, such thy thirst (insatiable thirst!"
8082,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"By fond indulgence but inflamed the more!),"
8083,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Fancy still cruises, when poor Sense is tired."
8084,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Imagination is the Paphian shop,"
8085,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Where feeble happiness, like Vulcan, lame,"
8086,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Bids foul ideas, in their dark recess,"
8087,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And hot as hell (which kindled the black fires),"
8088,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"With wanton art, those fatal arrows form,"
8089,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Which murder all thy time, health, wealth, and fame."
8090,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Would'st thou receive them, other thoughts there are,"
8091,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"On angel-wing, descending from above,                             1001"
8092,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Which these, with art divine, would counterwork,"
8093,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And form celestial armour for thy peace.
8094,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,In this is seen Imagination's guilt;
8095,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But who can count her follies? She betrays thee,"
8096,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,To think in grandeur there is something great.
8097,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"For works of curious art, and ancient fame,"
8098,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thy genius hungers, elegantly pain'd;"
8099,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And foreign climes must cater for thy taste.
8100,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Hence, what disaster!--Though the price was paid,                 1010"
8101,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That persecuting priest, the Turk of Rome,"
8102,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Whose foot (ye gods!) though cloven, must be kiss'd,"
8103,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Detain'd thy dinner on the Latian shore;
8104,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,(Such is the fate of honest Protestants!)
8105,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,And poor Magnificence is starved to death.
8106,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Hence just resentment, indignation, ire!--"
8107,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Be pacified: if outward things are great,"
8108,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,'Tis magnanimity great things to scorn;
8109,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Pompous expenses, and parades august,"
8110,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And courts, that insalubrious soil to peace.                      1020"
8111,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,True happiness ne'er enter'd at an eye;
8112,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,True happiness resides in things unseen.
8113,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"No smiles of Fortune ever bless'd the bad,"
8114,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Nor can her frowns rob Innocence of joys;
8115,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That jewel wanting, triple crowns are poor:"
8116,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"So tell his Holiness, and be revenged."
8117,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Pleasure, we both agree, is man's chief good;"
8118,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Our only contest, what deserves the name."
8119,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Give Pleasure's name to nought, but what has pass'd"
8120,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Th' authentic seal of Reason (which like Yorke,[49]               1030"
8121,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Demurs on what it passes), and defies"
8122,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The tooth of time; when past, a pleasure still;"
8123,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Dearer on trial, lovelier for its age,                            1033"
8124,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And doubly to be prized, as it promotes"
8125,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Our future, while it forms our present, joy."
8126,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Some joys the future overcast; and some
8127,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Throw all their beams that way, and gild the tomb."
8128,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Some joys endear eternity; some give
8129,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Abhorr'd annihilation dreadful charms.
8130,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Are rival joys contending for thy choice?                         1040
8131,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Consult thy whole existence, and be safe;"
8132,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,That oracle will put all doubt to flight.
8133,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Short is the lesson, though my lecture long;"
8134,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Be good--and let Heaven answer for the rest.
8135,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Yet, with a sigh o'er all mankind, I grant"
8136,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"In this our day of proof, our land of hope,"
8137,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The good man has his clouds that intervene;
8138,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Clouds, that obscure his sublunary day,"
8139,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But never conquer: even the best must own,"
8140,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Patience, and resignation, are the pillars                        1050"
8141,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of human peace on earth. The pillars, these:"
8142,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But those of Seth not more remote from thee,"
8143,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Till this heroic lesson thou hast learn'd;
8144,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To frown at pleasure, and to smile in pain."
8145,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Fired at the prospect of unclouded bliss,"
8146,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Heaven in reversion, like the sun, as yet"
8147,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Beneath th' horizon, cheers us in this world;"
8148,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"It sheds, on souls susceptible of light,"
8149,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The glorious dawn of our eternal day.
8150,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""This (says Lorenzo) is a fair harangue:                        1060"
8151,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,But can harangues blow back strong nature's stream;
8152,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Or stem the tide Heaven pushes through our veins,"
8153,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Which sweeps away man's impotent resolves,"
8154,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And lays his labour level with the world?"""
8155,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Themselves men make their comment on mankind;
8156,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And think nought is, but what they find at home:"
8157,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thus, weakness to chimera turns the truth.                        1067"
8158,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Nothing romantic has the Muse prescribed.
8159,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Above,[50] Lorenzo saw the man of earth,"
8160,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The mortal man; and wretched was the sight.
8161,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To balance that, to comfort, and exalt,"
8162,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Now see the man immortal: him, I mean,"
8163,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who lives as such; whose heart, full bent on heaven,"
8164,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Leans all that way, his bias to the stars."
8165,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The world's dark shades, in contrast set, shall raise"
8166,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His lustre more; though bright, without a foil:"
8167,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Observe his awful portrait, and admire;"
8168,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Nor stop at wonder; imitate, and live."
8169,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Some angel guide my pencil, while I draw,"
8170,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,What nothing less than angel can exceed!                          1080
8171,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A man on earth devoted to the skies;
8172,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Like ships in sea, while in, above the world."
8173,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"With aspect mild, and elevated eye,"
8174,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Behold him seated on a mount serene,"
8175,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Above the fogs of sense, and passion's storm;"
8176,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"All the black cares, and tumults, of this life,"
8177,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Like harmless thunders, breaking at his feet,"
8178,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Excite his pity, not impair his peace."
8179,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Earth's genuine sons, the sceptred, and the slave,"
8180,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A mingled mob! a wandering herd! he sees,                         1090"
8181,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Bewilder'd in the vale; in all unlike!
8182,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,His full reverse in all! What higher praise?
8183,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,What stronger demonstration of the right?
8184,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The present all their care; the future, his."
8185,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"When public welfare calls, or private want,"
8186,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,They give to fame; his bounty he conceals.
8187,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Their virtues varnish nature; his exalt.
8188,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Mankind's esteem they court; and he, his own."
8189,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Theirs, the wild chase of false felicities;"
8190,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His, the composed possession of the true.                         1100"
8191,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Alike throughout is his consistent peace,"
8192,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"All of one colour, and an even thread;"
8193,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"While party-colour'd shreds of happiness,"
8194,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"With hideous gaps between, patch up for them"
8195,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A madman's robe; each puff of Fortune blows
8196,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The tatters by, and shows their nakedness."
8197,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,He sees with other eyes than theirs: where they
8198,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Behold a sun, he spies a Deity;"
8199,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What makes them only smile, makes him adore."
8200,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Where they see mountains, he but atoms sees;                      1110"
8201,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"An empire, in his balance, weighs a grain."
8202,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"They things terrestrial worship, as divine:"
8203,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His hopes immortal blow them by, as dust,"
8204,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That dims his sight, and shortens his survey,"
8205,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Which longs, in infinite, to lose all bound."
8206,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Titles and honours (if they prove his fate)
8207,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,He lays aside to find his dignity;
8208,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,No dignity they find in aught besides.
8209,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,They triumph in externals (which conceal
8210,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Man's real glory), proud of an eclipse.                           1120"
8211,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Himself too much he prizes to be proud,"
8212,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And nothing thinks so great in man, as man."
8213,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Too dear he holds his interest, to neglect"
8214,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Another's welfare, or his right invade;"
8215,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Their interest, like a lion, lives on prey."
8216,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,They kindle at the shadow of a wrong:
8217,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Wrong he sustains with temper, looks on heaven,"
8218,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Nor stoops to think his injurer his foe;
8219,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Nought, but what wounds his virtue, wounds his peace."
8220,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A cover'd heart their character defends;                          1130
8221,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A cover'd heart denies him half his praise.
8222,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,With nakedness his innocence agrees;
8223,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,While their broad foliage testifies their fall:
8224,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Their no joys end, where his full feast begins;                   1134"
8225,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His joys create, theirs murder, future bliss."
8226,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To triumph in existence, his alone;"
8227,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And his alone, triumphantly to think"
8228,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,His true existence is not yet begun.
8229,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His glorious course was, yesterday, complete;"
8230,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Death, then, was welcome; yet life still is sweet."
8231,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"But nothing charms Lorenzo, like the firm,"
8232,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Undaunted breast--and whose is that high praise?                  1142
8233,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"They yield to pleasure, though they danger brave,"
8234,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And show no fortitude, but in the field;"
8235,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"If there they show it, 'tis for glory shown;"
8236,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Nor will that cordial always man their hearts.
8237,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A cordial his sustains, that cannot fail;"
8238,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"By pleasure unsubdued, unbroke by pain,"
8239,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,He shares in that Omnipotence he trusts.
8240,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"All-bearing, all-attempting, till he falls;                       1150"
8241,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And when he falls, writes VICI on his shield."
8242,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From magnanimity, all fear above;"
8243,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From nobler recompence, above applause;"
8244,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Which owes to man's short outlook all its charms.
8245,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Backward to credit what he never felt,"
8246,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Lorenzo cries,--""Where shines this miracle?"
8247,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"From what root rises this immortal man?"""
8248,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A root that grows not in Lorenzo's ground;
8249,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"The root dissect, nor wonder at the flower."
8250,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,He follows nature (not like thee) and shows us                    1160
8251,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,An uninverted system of a man.
8252,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His appetite wears Reason's golden chain,"
8253,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And finds, in due restraint, its luxury."
8254,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His passion, like an eagle well reclaim'd,"
8255,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Is taught to fly at nought, but infinite."
8256,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Patient his hope, unanxious is his care,"
8257,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His caution fearless, and his grief (if grief"
8258,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The gods ordain) a stranger to despair.                           1168
8259,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And why?--because affection, more than meet,"
8260,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,His wisdom leaves not disengaged from heaven.
8261,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Those secondary goods that smile on earth,"
8262,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"He, loving in proportion, loves in peace."
8263,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"They most the world enjoy, who least admire."
8264,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,His understanding 'scapes the common cloud
8265,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Of fumes, arising from a boiling breast."
8266,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"His head is clear, because his heart is cool,"
8267,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,By worldly competitions uninflamed.
8268,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The moderate movements of his soul admit
8269,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Distinct ideas, and matured debate,"
8270,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"An eye impartial, and an even scale;                              1180"
8271,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Whence judgment sound, and unrepenting choice."
8272,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Thus, in a double sense, the good are wise;"
8273,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"On its own dunghill, wiser than the world."
8274,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"What, then, the world? It must be doubly weak;"
8275,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Strange truth! as soon would they believe their creed.
8276,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Yet thus it is; nor otherwise can be;
8277,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"So far from aught romantic, what I sing."
8278,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Bliss has no being, virtue has no strength,"
8279,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,But from the prospect of immortal life.
8280,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who think earth all, or (what weighs just the same)               1190"
8281,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who care no farther, must prize what it yields;"
8282,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Fond of its fancies, proud of its parades."
8283,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Who thinks earth nothing, can't its charms admire;"
8284,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"He can't a foe, though most malignant, hate,"
8285,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Because that hate would prove his greater foe.
8286,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,'Tis hard for them (yet who so loudly boast
8287,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Good-will to men?) to love their dearest friend;
8288,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"For may not he invade their good supreme,"
8289,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Where the least jealousy turns love to gall?

8354,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Wit, widow'd of good sense, is worse than nought;"

8360,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A joy, in which our reason bears no part,                         1270"
8361,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Is but a sorrow, tickling, ere it stings."
8362,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Let not the cooings of the world allure thee;
8363,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Which of her lovers ever found her true?
8364,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Happy! of this bad world who little know?--
8365,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And yet, we much must know her, to be safe;"
8366,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"To know the world, not love her, is thy point;"
8367,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"She gives but little, nor that little, long."
8368,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"There is, I grant, a triumph of the pulse;"

8371,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"That mantles high, that sparkles, and expires,"
8372,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Leaving the soul more vapid than before.
8373,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,An animal ovation! such as holds
8374,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"No commerce with our reason, but subsists"
8375,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"On juices, through the well-toned tubes, well strain'd;"
8376,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,A nice machine! scarce ever tuned aright;
8377,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And when it jars--thy syrens sing no more,"
8378,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,Thy dance is done; the demi-god is thrown
8379,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"(Short apotheosis!) beneath the man,"
8380,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"In coward gloom immersed, or fell despair.                        1290"

8384,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,(A field of battle is this mortal life!)
8385,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"When danger threatens, lay it on thy heart;"
8386,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"A single sentence, proof against the world:"
8387,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"""Soul, body, fortune!--every good pertains"

8395,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,The single lesson of mankind on earth.
8396,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"And yet--yet, what? No news! Mankind is mad;"
8397,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Such mighty numbers list against the right,"
8398,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"(And what can't numbers, when bewitch'd, achieve!)"
8399,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"They talk themselves to something like belief,"

8401,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Grinn'd from the port, on every sail his own."
8402,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,They grin; but wherefore? and how long the laugh?
8403,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"Half ignorance, their mirth; and half, a lie;                     1313"

8468,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,"So far, at that re-hearing, from redress,"
8469,VIRTUE'S APOLOGY.,They then turn witnesses against themselves;

8572,THE CONSOLATION.,"And Conscience, deaden'd by repeated strokes,                       40"
8573,THE CONSOLATION.,Has into manners naturalized our crimes;
8574,THE CONSOLATION.,"The curse of curses is, our curse to love;"
8575,THE CONSOLATION.,To triumph in the blackness of our guilt
8576,THE CONSOLATION.,"(As Indians glory in the deepest jet),"
8577,THE CONSOLATION.,And throw aside our senses with our peace.
8578,THE CONSOLATION.,"But grant no guilt, no shame, no least alloy;"
8579,THE CONSOLATION.,Grant joy and glory quite unsullied shone;
8580,THE CONSOLATION.,"Yet, still, it ill deserves Lorenzo's heart."
8581,THE CONSOLATION.,"No joy, no glory, glitters in thy sight,"
8582,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, through the thin partition of an hour,                         50"
8583,THE CONSOLATION.,I see its sables wove by destiny;
8584,THE CONSOLATION.,"And that in sorrow buried; this, in shame;"
8585,THE CONSOLATION.,While howling furies wring the doleful knell;
8586,THE CONSOLATION.,"And Conscience, now so soft thou scarce canst hear                  54"
8587,THE CONSOLATION.,"Her whisper, echoes her eternal peal."
8588,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where, the prime actors of the last year's scene;"
8589,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their port so proud, their buskin, and their plume?"
8590,THE CONSOLATION.,"How many sleep, who kept the world awake"
8591,THE CONSOLATION.,"With lustre, and with noise! has Death proclaim'd"
8592,THE CONSOLATION.,"A truce, and hung his sated lance on high?"
8593,THE CONSOLATION.,'Tis brandish'd still; nor shall the present year
8594,THE CONSOLATION.,"Be more tenacious of her human leaf,                                62"
8595,THE CONSOLATION.,Or spread of feeble life a thinner fall.
8596,THE CONSOLATION.,But needless monuments to wake the thought;
8597,THE CONSOLATION.,Life's gayest scenes speak man's mortality;
8598,THE CONSOLATION.,"Though in a style more florid, full as plain,"
8599,THE CONSOLATION.,"As mausoleums, pyramids, and tombs."
8600,THE CONSOLATION.,"What are our noblest ornaments, but deaths"
8601,THE CONSOLATION.,"Turn'd flatterers of life, in paint, or marble,"
8602,THE CONSOLATION.,"The well-stain'd canvas, or the featured stone?                     70"
8603,THE CONSOLATION.,"Our fathers grace, or rather haunt, the scene."
8604,THE CONSOLATION.,Joy peoples her pavilion from the dead.
8605,THE CONSOLATION.,"""Profess'd diversions! cannot these escape?"""
8606,THE CONSOLATION.,Far from it: these present us with a shroud;
8607,THE CONSOLATION.,"And talk of death, like garlands o'er a grave."
8608,THE CONSOLATION.,"As some bold plunderers, for buried wealth,"
8609,THE CONSOLATION.,We ransack tombs for pastime; from the dust
8610,THE CONSOLATION.,Call up the sleeping hero; bid him tread
8611,THE CONSOLATION.,The scene for our amusement: how like gods
8612,THE CONSOLATION.,"We sit; and, wrapt in immortality,                                  80"
8613,THE CONSOLATION.,Shed generous tears on wretches born to die;
8614,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their fate deploring, to forget our own!"
8615,THE CONSOLATION.,"What all the pomps and triumphs of our lives,"
8616,THE CONSOLATION.,"But legacies in blossom? Our lean soil,"
8617,THE CONSOLATION.,"Luxuriant grown, and rank in vanities,"
8618,THE CONSOLATION.,From friends interr'd beneath; a rich manure!
8619,THE CONSOLATION.,"Like other worms, we banquet on the dead;"
8620,THE CONSOLATION.,"Like other worms, shall we crawl on, nor know                       88"
8621,THE CONSOLATION.,"Our present frailties, or approaching fate?"
8622,THE CONSOLATION.,Lorenzo! such the glories of the world!
8623,THE CONSOLATION.,What is the world itself? thy world--a grave.
8624,THE CONSOLATION.,Where is the dust that has not been alive?
8625,THE CONSOLATION.,"The spade, the plough, disturb our ancestors;"
8626,THE CONSOLATION.,From human mould we reap our daily bread.
8627,THE CONSOLATION.,"The globe around earth's hollow surface shakes,"
8628,THE CONSOLATION.,And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons.
8629,THE CONSOLATION.,O'er devastation we blind revels keep;
8630,THE CONSOLATION.,Whole buried towns support the dancer's heel.
8631,THE CONSOLATION.,The moist of human frame the sun exhales;
8632,THE CONSOLATION.,Winds scatter through the mighty void the dry;                     100
8633,THE CONSOLATION.,"Earth repossesses part of what she gave,"
8634,THE CONSOLATION.,And the freed spirit mounts on wings of fire;
8635,THE CONSOLATION.,Each element partakes our scatter'd spoils;
8636,THE CONSOLATION.,"As nature, wide, our ruins spread: man's death"
8637,THE CONSOLATION.,"Inhabits all things, but the thought of man."
8638,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor man alone; his breathing bust expires,"
8639,THE CONSOLATION.,"His tomb is mortal; empires die: where, now,"
8640,THE CONSOLATION.,"The Roman? Greek? They stalk, an empty name!"
8641,THE CONSOLATION.,Yet few regard them in this useful light;
8642,THE CONSOLATION.,Though half our learning is their epitaph.                         110
8643,THE CONSOLATION.,"When down thy vale, unlock'd by midnight thought,"
8644,THE CONSOLATION.,"That loves to wander in thy sunless realms,"
8645,THE CONSOLATION.,O Death! I stretch my view: what visions rise!
8646,THE CONSOLATION.,What triumphs! toils imperial! arts divine!
8647,THE CONSOLATION.,In wither'd laurels glide before my sight!
8648,THE CONSOLATION.,"What lengths of far-famed ages, billow'd high"
8649,THE CONSOLATION.,"With human agitation, roll along"
8650,THE CONSOLATION.,In unsubstantial images of air!
8651,THE CONSOLATION.,"The melancholy ghosts of dead renown,"
8652,THE CONSOLATION.,"Whispering faint echoes of the world's applause,                   120"
8653,THE CONSOLATION.,"With penitential aspect, as they pass,"
8654,THE CONSOLATION.,"All point at earth, and hiss at human pride,                       122"
8655,THE CONSOLATION.,"The wisdom of the wise, and prancings of the great."
8656,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, O Lorenzo! far the rest above,"
8657,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of ghastly nature, and enormous size,"
8658,THE CONSOLATION.,"One form assaults my sight, and chills my blood,"
8659,THE CONSOLATION.,And shakes my frame. Of one departed world[52]
8660,THE CONSOLATION.,I see the mighty shadow: oozy wreath
8661,THE CONSOLATION.,And dismal seaweed crown her; o'er her urn
8662,THE CONSOLATION.,"Reclined, she weeps her desolated realms,                          130"
8663,THE CONSOLATION.,"And bloated sons; and, weeping, prophesies"
8664,THE CONSOLATION.,"Another's dissolution, soon, in flames."
8665,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, like Cassandra, prophesies in vain;"
8666,THE CONSOLATION.,"In vain, to many; not, I trust, to thee."
8667,THE CONSOLATION.,"For, know'st thou not, or art thou loath to know,"
8668,THE CONSOLATION.,"The great decree, the counsel of the skies?"
8669,THE CONSOLATION.,"Deluge and conflagration, dreadful powers!"
8670,THE CONSOLATION.,Prime ministers of vengeance! chain'd in caves
8671,THE CONSOLATION.,"Distinct, apart the giant furies roar;"
8672,THE CONSOLATION.,"Apart; or, such their horrid rage for ruin,                        140"
8673,THE CONSOLATION.,"In mutual conflict would they rise, and wage"
8674,THE CONSOLATION.,"Eternal war, till one was quite devour'd."
8675,THE CONSOLATION.,"But not for this, ordain'd their boundless rage;"
8676,THE CONSOLATION.,"When Heaven's inferior instruments of wrath,"
8677,THE CONSOLATION.,"War, famine, pestilence, are found too weak"
8678,THE CONSOLATION.,"To scourge a world for her enormous crimes,"
8679,THE CONSOLATION.,"These are let loose, alternate: down they rush,"
8680,THE CONSOLATION.,"Swift and tempestuous, from th' eternal throne,"
8681,THE CONSOLATION.,"With irresistible commission arm'd,"
8682,THE CONSOLATION.,"The world, in vain corrected, to destroy,                          150"
8683,THE CONSOLATION.,And ease creation of the shocking scene.
8684,THE CONSOLATION.,"Seest thou, Lorenzo! what depends on man?"
8685,THE CONSOLATION.,"The fate of Nature; as for man, her birth."
8686,THE CONSOLATION.,"Earth's actors change earth's transitory scenes,"
8687,THE CONSOLATION.,And make creation groan with human guilt.                          155
8688,THE CONSOLATION.,"How must it groan, in a new deluge whelm'd,"
8689,THE CONSOLATION.,"But not of waters! At the destined hour,"
8690,THE CONSOLATION.,"By the loud trumpet summon'd to the charge,"
8691,THE CONSOLATION.,"See, all the formidable sons of fire,"
8692,THE CONSOLATION.,"Eruptions, earthquakes, comets, lightnings, play"
8693,THE CONSOLATION.,Their various engines; all at once disgorge
8694,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their blazing magazines; and take, by storm,                       162"
8695,THE CONSOLATION.,This poor terrestrial citadel of man.
8696,THE CONSOLATION.,Amazing period! when each mountain-height
8697,THE CONSOLATION.,Outburns Vesuvius; rocks eternal pour
8698,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their melted mass, as rivers once they pour'd;"
8699,THE CONSOLATION.,Stars rush; and final Ruin fiercely drives
8700,THE CONSOLATION.,"Her ploughshare o'er creation!--while aloft,"
8701,THE CONSOLATION.,More than astonishment! if more can be!
8702,THE CONSOLATION.,"Far other firmament than e'er was seen,                            170"
8703,THE CONSOLATION.,Than e'er was thought by man! far other stars!
8704,THE CONSOLATION.,"Stars animate, that govern these of fire;"
8705,THE CONSOLATION.,"Far other sun!--A sun, O how unlike"
8706,THE CONSOLATION.,"The Babe at Bethlehem! how unlike the Man,"
8707,THE CONSOLATION.,That groan'd on Calvary!--Yet He it is;
8708,THE CONSOLATION.,That Man of Sorrows! O how changed! what pomp!
8709,THE CONSOLATION.,"In grandeur terrible, all heaven descends!"
8710,THE CONSOLATION.,"And gods, ambitious, triumph in his train."
8711,THE CONSOLATION.,"A swift archangel, with his golden wing,"
8712,THE CONSOLATION.,"As blots and clouds, that darken and disgrace                      180"
8713,THE CONSOLATION.,"The scene divine, sweeps stars and suns aside."
8714,THE CONSOLATION.,"And now, all dross removed, heaven's own pure day,"
8715,THE CONSOLATION.,"Full on the confines of our ether, flames:"
8716,THE CONSOLATION.,"While (dreadful contrast!) far, how far beneath!"
8717,THE CONSOLATION.,"Hell, bursting, belches forth her blazing seas,"
8718,THE CONSOLATION.,And storms sulphureous; her voracious jaws
8719,THE CONSOLATION.,"Expanding wide, and roaring for her prey."
8720,THE CONSOLATION.,Lorenzo! welcome to this scene; the last
8721,THE CONSOLATION.,In nature's course; the first in wisdom's thought.                 189
8722,THE CONSOLATION.,"This strikes, if aught can strike thee; this awakes"
8723,THE CONSOLATION.,The most supine; this snatches man from death.
8724,THE CONSOLATION.,"Rouse, rouse, Lorenzo, then, and follow me,"
8725,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where truth, the most momentous man can hear,"
8726,THE CONSOLATION.,"Loud calls my soul, and ardour wings her flight."
8727,THE CONSOLATION.,I find my inspiration in my theme:
8728,THE CONSOLATION.,The grandeur of my subject is my Muse.
8729,THE CONSOLATION.,"At midnight, when mankind is wrapt in peace,"
8730,THE CONSOLATION.,And worldly fancy feeds on golden dreams;
8731,THE CONSOLATION.,To give more dread to man's most dreadful hour.
8732,THE CONSOLATION.,"At midnight, 'tis presumed, this pomp will burst                   200"
8733,THE CONSOLATION.,From tenfold darkness; sudden as the spark
8734,THE CONSOLATION.,"From smitten steel; from nitrous grain, the blaze."
8735,THE CONSOLATION.,"Man, starting from his couch, shall sleep no more!"
8736,THE CONSOLATION.,"The day is broke, which never more shall close!"
8737,THE CONSOLATION.,"Above, around, beneath, amazement all!"
8738,THE CONSOLATION.,Terror and glory join'd in their extremes!
8739,THE CONSOLATION.,"Our God in grandeur, and our world on fire!"
8740,THE CONSOLATION.,All nature struggling in the pangs of death!
8741,THE CONSOLATION.,Dost thou not hear her? Dost thou not deplore
8742,THE CONSOLATION.,"Her strong convulsions, and her final groan?                       210"
8743,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where are we now? Ah me! the ground is gone,"
8744,THE CONSOLATION.,"On which we stood; Lorenzo! while thou may'st,"
8745,THE CONSOLATION.,"Provide more firm support, or sink for ever!"
8746,THE CONSOLATION.,Where? how? from whence? Vain hope! it is too late!
8747,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where, where, for shelter, shall the guilty fly,"
8748,THE CONSOLATION.,When consternation turns the good man pale?
8749,THE CONSOLATION.,Great day! for which all other days were made;
8750,THE CONSOLATION.,"For which earth rose from chaos, man from earth;"
8751,THE CONSOLATION.,"And an eternity, the date of gods,"
8752,THE CONSOLATION.,Descended on poor earth-created man!                               220
8753,THE CONSOLATION.,"Great day of dread, decision, and despair!"
8754,THE CONSOLATION.,"At thought of thee, each sublunary wish"
8755,THE CONSOLATION.,"Lets go its eager grasp, and drops the world;                      223"
8756,THE CONSOLATION.,And catches at each reed of hope in heaven.
8757,THE CONSOLATION.,At thought of thee!--And art thou absent then?
8758,THE CONSOLATION.,Lorenzo! no; 'tis here; it is begun;--
8759,THE CONSOLATION.,"Already is begun the grand assize,"
8760,THE CONSOLATION.,"In thee, in all: deputed Conscience scales"
8761,THE CONSOLATION.,"The dread tribunal, and forestalls our doom;"
8762,THE CONSOLATION.,"Forestalls; and, by forestalling, proves it sure.                  230"
8763,THE CONSOLATION.,Why on himself should man void judgment pass?
8764,THE CONSOLATION.,Is idle Nature laughing at her sons?
8765,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who Conscience sent, her sentence will support,"
8766,THE CONSOLATION.,And God above assert that God in man.
8767,THE CONSOLATION.,Thrice happy they that enter now the court
8768,THE CONSOLATION.,"Heaven opens in their bosoms! but, how rare,"
8769,THE CONSOLATION.,"Ah me! that magnanimity, how rare!"
8770,THE CONSOLATION.,"What hero, like the man who stands himself;"
8771,THE CONSOLATION.,Who dares to meet his naked heart alone;
8772,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who bears, intrepid, the full charge it brings,                    240"
8773,THE CONSOLATION.,Resolved to silence future murmurs there?
8774,THE CONSOLATION.,"The coward flies; and, flying, is undone."
8775,THE CONSOLATION.,(Art thou a coward? No.) The coward flies;
8776,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thinks, but thinks slightly; asks, but fears to know;"
8777,THE CONSOLATION.,"Asks, ""What is truth?"" with Pilate; and retires;"
8778,THE CONSOLATION.,"Dissolves the court, and mingles with the throng;"
8779,THE CONSOLATION.,"Asylum sad! from reason, hope, and heaven!"
8780,THE CONSOLATION.,"Shall all, but man look out with ardent eye,"
8781,THE CONSOLATION.,"For that great day, which was ordain'd for man?"
8782,THE CONSOLATION.,O day of consummation! mark supreme                                250
8783,THE CONSOLATION.,"(If men are wise) of human thought! nor least,"
8784,THE CONSOLATION.,"Or in the sight of angels, or their King!"
8785,THE CONSOLATION.,"Angels, whose radiant circles, height o'er height,"
8786,THE CONSOLATION.,"Order o'er order, rising, blaze o'er blaze,"
8787,THE CONSOLATION.,"As in a theatre, surround this scene,"
8788,THE CONSOLATION.,"Intent on man, and anxious for his fate."
8789,THE CONSOLATION.,"Angels look out for thee; for thee, their Lord,                    257"
8790,THE CONSOLATION.,"To vindicate his glory; and for thee,"
8791,THE CONSOLATION.,"Creation universal calls aloud,"
8792,THE CONSOLATION.,"To disinvolve the moral world, and give"
8793,THE CONSOLATION.,To Nature's renovation brighter charms.
8794,THE CONSOLATION.,"Shall man alone, whose fate, whose final fate"
8795,THE CONSOLATION.,"Hangs on that hour, exclude it from his thought?"
8796,THE CONSOLATION.,I think of nothing else; I see! I feel it!
8797,THE CONSOLATION.,"All nature, like an earthquake, trembling round!"
8798,THE CONSOLATION.,"All deities, like summer's swarms, on wing!"
8799,THE CONSOLATION.,All basking in the full meridian blaze!
8800,THE CONSOLATION.,I see the Judge enthroned! the flaming guard!
8801,THE CONSOLATION.,The volume open'd! open'd every heart!
8802,THE CONSOLATION.,A sunbeam pointing out each secret thought!                        270
8803,THE CONSOLATION.,No patron! intercessor none! now past
8804,THE CONSOLATION.,"The sweet, the clement, mediatorial hour!"
8805,THE CONSOLATION.,"For guilt no plea! to pain, no pause! no bound!"
8806,THE CONSOLATION.,"Inexorable, all! and all, extreme!"
8807,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor man alone; the Foe of God and man,"
8808,THE CONSOLATION.,"From his dark den, blaspheming, drags his chain,"
8809,THE CONSOLATION.,"And rears his brazen front, with thunder scarr'd:"
8810,THE CONSOLATION.,"Receives his sentence, and begins his hell."
8811,THE CONSOLATION.,"All vengeance past, now, seems abundant grace:"
8812,THE CONSOLATION.,"Like meteors in a stormy sky, how roll                             280"
8813,THE CONSOLATION.,His baleful eyes! he curses whom he dreads;
8814,THE CONSOLATION.,And deems it the first moment of his fall.
8815,THE CONSOLATION.,'Tis present to my thought!--and yet where is it?
8816,THE CONSOLATION.,Angels can't tell me; angels cannot guess
8817,THE CONSOLATION.,The period; from created beings lock'd
8818,THE CONSOLATION.,"In darkness. But the process, and the place,"
8819,THE CONSOLATION.,Are less obscure; for these may man inquire.
8820,THE CONSOLATION.,"Say, thou great close of human hopes and fears!"
8821,THE CONSOLATION.,Great key of hearts! great finisher of fates!
8822,THE CONSOLATION.,"Great end! and great beginning! say, Where art thou?"
8823,THE CONSOLATION.,"Art thou in time, or in eternity?                                  291"
8824,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor in eternity, nor time, I find thee."
8825,THE CONSOLATION.,"These, as two monarchs, on their borders meet,"
8826,THE CONSOLATION.,"(Monarchs of all elapsed, or unarrived!)"
8827,THE CONSOLATION.,"As in debate, how best their powers allied,"
8828,THE CONSOLATION.,"May swell the grandeur, or discharge the wrath,"
8829,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of Him, whom both their monarchies obey."
8830,THE CONSOLATION.,"Time, this vast fabric for him built (and doom'd"
8831,THE CONSOLATION.,"With him to fall), now bursting o'er his head;"
8832,THE CONSOLATION.,"His lamp, the sun, extinguish'd; from beneath                      300"
8833,THE CONSOLATION.,"The frown of hideous darkness, calls his sons"
8834,THE CONSOLATION.,"From their long slumber; from earth's heaving womb,"
8835,THE CONSOLATION.,To second birth! contemporary throng!
8836,THE CONSOLATION.,"Roused at one call, upstarted from one bed,"
8837,THE CONSOLATION.,"Press'd in one crowd, appall'd with one amaze,"
8838,THE CONSOLATION.,"He turns them o'er, Eternity! to thee."
8839,THE CONSOLATION.,Then (as a king deposed disdains to live)
8840,THE CONSOLATION.,He falls on his own scythe; nor falls alone:
8841,THE CONSOLATION.,"His greatest foe falls with him; Time, and he"
8842,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who murder'd all Time's offspring, Death, expire.                  310"
8843,THE CONSOLATION.,Time was! Eternity now reigns alone:
8844,THE CONSOLATION.,Awful eternity! offended queen!
8845,THE CONSOLATION.,"And her resentment to mankind, how just!"
8846,THE CONSOLATION.,"With kind intent, soliciting access,"
8847,THE CONSOLATION.,How often has she knock'd at human hearts!
8848,THE CONSOLATION.,Rich to repay their hospitality;
8849,THE CONSOLATION.,How often call'd! and with the voice of God!
8850,THE CONSOLATION.,"Yet bore repulse, excluded as a cheat!"
8851,THE CONSOLATION.,A dream! while foulest foes found welcome there!
8852,THE CONSOLATION.,"A dream, a cheat, now, all things, but her smile.                  320"
8853,THE CONSOLATION.,"For, lo! her twice ten thousand gates thrown wide,"
8854,THE CONSOLATION.,"As thrice from Indus to the frozen pole,"
8855,THE CONSOLATION.,"With banners streaming as the comet's blaze,"
8856,THE CONSOLATION.,"And clarions, louder than the deep in storms,"
8857,THE CONSOLATION.,"Sonorous as immortal breath can blow,                              325"
8858,THE CONSOLATION.,"Pour forth their myriads, potentates, and powers,"
8859,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of light, of darkness; in a middle field,"
8860,THE CONSOLATION.,"Wide, as creation! populous, as wide!"
8861,THE CONSOLATION.,A neutral region! there to mark th' event
8862,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of that great drama, whose preceding scenes"
8863,THE CONSOLATION.,"Detain'd them close spectators, through a length"
8864,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of ages, ripening to this grand result;                            332"
8865,THE CONSOLATION.,"Ages, as yet unnumber'd, but by God;"
8866,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who now, pronouncing sentence, vindicates"
8867,THE CONSOLATION.,"The rights of Virtue, and his own renown."
8868,THE CONSOLATION.,"Eternity, the various sentence past,"
8869,THE CONSOLATION.,"Assigns the sever'd throng distinct abodes,"
8870,THE CONSOLATION.,"Sulphureous, or ambrosial. What ensues?"
8871,THE CONSOLATION.,The deed predominant! the deed of deeds!
8872,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which makes a hell of hell, a heaven of heaven.                    340"

9178,THE CONSOLATION.,"'Tis elder Scripture, writ by God's own hand:"
9179,THE CONSOLATION.,Scripture authentic! uncorrupt by man.
9180,THE CONSOLATION.,Lorenzo! with my radius (the rich gift
9181,THE CONSOLATION.,Of thought nocturnal!) I'll point out to thee
9182,THE CONSOLATION.,Its various lessons; some that may surprise                        650
9183,THE CONSOLATION.,An un-adept in mysteries of Night;
9184,THE CONSOLATION.,"Little, perhaps, expected in her school,"
9185,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor thought to grow on planet, or on star."
9186,THE CONSOLATION.,"Bulls, lions, scorpions, monsters here we feign;"
9187,THE CONSOLATION.,"Ourselves more monstrous, not to see what here"
9188,THE CONSOLATION.,Exists indeed;--a lecture to mankind.
9189,THE CONSOLATION.,What read we here?--Th' existence of a God?
9190,THE CONSOLATION.,"Yes; and of other beings, man above;"
9191,THE CONSOLATION.,Natives of ether! sons of higher climes!
9192,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, what may move Lorenzo's wonder more,                          660"
9193,THE CONSOLATION.,Eternity is written in the skies.                                  661
9194,THE CONSOLATION.,And whose eternity?--Lorenzo! thine
9195,THE CONSOLATION.,"Mankind's eternity. Nor Faith alone,"
9196,THE CONSOLATION.,Virtue grows here; here springs the sovereign cure
9197,THE CONSOLATION.,Of almost every vice; but chiefly thine;
9198,THE CONSOLATION.,"Wrath, Pride, Ambition, and impure Desire."
9199,THE CONSOLATION.,"Lorenzo! thou canst wake at midnight too,"
9200,THE CONSOLATION.,"Though not on morals bent: Ambition, Pleasure!"
9201,THE CONSOLATION.,"Those tyrants I for thee so lately fought,[59]"
9202,THE CONSOLATION.,Afford their harass'd slaves but slender rest.                     670
9203,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thou, to whom midnight is immoral noon,"
9204,THE CONSOLATION.,"And the sun's noontide blaze, prime dawn of day;"
9205,THE CONSOLATION.,"Not by thy climate, but capricious crime,"
9206,THE CONSOLATION.,Commencing one of our antipodes!
9207,THE CONSOLATION.,"In thy nocturnal rove, one moment halt,"
9208,THE CONSOLATION.,"'Twixt stage and stage, of riot, and cabal;"
9209,THE CONSOLATION.,"And lift thine eye (if bold an eye to lift,"
9210,THE CONSOLATION.,If bold to meet the face of injured Heaven)
9211,THE CONSOLATION.,"To yonder stars: for other ends they shine,"
9212,THE CONSOLATION.,"Than to light revellers from shame to shame,                       680"
9213,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, thus, be made accomplices in guilt."
9214,THE CONSOLATION.,"Why from yon arch, that infinite of space,"
9215,THE CONSOLATION.,"With infinite of lucid orbs replete,"
9216,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which set the living firmament on fire,"
9217,THE CONSOLATION.,"At the first glance, in such an overwhelm"
9218,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of wonderful, on man's astonish'd sight,"
9219,THE CONSOLATION.,Rushes Omnipotence--To curb our pride;
9220,THE CONSOLATION.,"Our reason rouse, and lead it to that Power,"
9221,THE CONSOLATION.,Whose love lets down these silver chains of light;
9222,THE CONSOLATION.,"To draw up man's ambition to Himself,                              690"
9223,THE CONSOLATION.,And bind our chaste affections to His throne.
9224,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thus the three virtues, least alive on earth,"
9225,THE CONSOLATION.,"And welcomed on heaven's coast with most applause,"
9226,THE CONSOLATION.,"An humble, pure, and heavenly-minded heart,                        694"
9227,THE CONSOLATION.,Are here inspired:--and canst thou gaze too long?
9228,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor stands thy wrath deprived of its reproof,"
9229,THE CONSOLATION.,Or un-upbraided by this radiant choir.
9230,THE CONSOLATION.,The planets of each system represent
9231,THE CONSOLATION.,Kind neighbours; mutual amity prevails;
9232,THE CONSOLATION.,"Sweet interchange of rays, received, return'd;"
9233,THE CONSOLATION.,"Enlightening, and enlighten'd! all, at once,"
9234,THE CONSOLATION.,"Attracting, and attracted! Patriot like,                           702"
9235,THE CONSOLATION.,None sins against the welfare of the whole;
9236,THE CONSOLATION.,"But their reciprocal, unselfish aid,"
9237,THE CONSOLATION.,Affords an emblem of millennial love.
9238,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nothing in nature, much less conscious being,"
9239,THE CONSOLATION.,Was e'er created solely for itself:
9240,THE CONSOLATION.,Thus man his sovereign duty learns in this
9241,THE CONSOLATION.,Material picture of benevolence.
9242,THE CONSOLATION.,"And know, of all our supercilious race,                          710"
9243,THE CONSOLATION.,Thou most inflammable! thou wasp of men!
9244,THE CONSOLATION.,"Man's angry heart, inspected, would be found"
9245,THE CONSOLATION.,"As rightly set, as are the starry spheres;"
9246,THE CONSOLATION.,"'Tis Nature's structure, broke by stubborn will,"
9247,THE CONSOLATION.,Breeds all that uncelestial discord there.
9248,THE CONSOLATION.,Wilt thou not feel the bias Nature gave?
9249,THE CONSOLATION.,"Canst thou descend from converse with the skies,"
9250,THE CONSOLATION.,"And seize thy brother's throat?--For what--a clod,"
9251,THE CONSOLATION.,"An inch of earth? The planets cry, ""Forbear!"""
9252,THE CONSOLATION.,"They chase our double darkness; Nature's gloom,                    720"
9253,THE CONSOLATION.,And (kinder still!) our intellectual night.
9254,THE CONSOLATION.,"And see, Day's amiable sister sends"
9255,THE CONSOLATION.,"Her invitation, in the softest rays"
9256,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of mitigated lustre; courts thy sight,"
9257,THE CONSOLATION.,Which suffers from her tyrant brother's blaze.
9258,THE CONSOLATION.,"Night grants thee the full freedom of the skies,"
9259,THE CONSOLATION.,Nor rudely reprimands thy lifted eye;
9260,THE CONSOLATION.,"With gain, and joy, she bribes thee to be wise.                    728"
9261,THE CONSOLATION.,"Night opes the noblest scenes, and sheds an awe,"
9262,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which gives those venerable scenes full weight,"
9263,THE CONSOLATION.,"And deep reception, in th' intender'd heart;"
9264,THE CONSOLATION.,"While light peeps through the darkness, like a spy;"
9265,THE CONSOLATION.,And darkness shows its grandeur by the light.
9266,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor is the profit greater than the joy,"
9267,THE CONSOLATION.,"If human hearts at glorious objects glow,"
9268,THE CONSOLATION.,And admiration can inspire delight.
9269,THE CONSOLATION.,"What speak I more, than I, this moment, feel?"
9270,THE CONSOLATION.,With pleasing stupor first the soul is struck
9271,THE CONSOLATION.,(Stupor ordain'd to make her truly wise!):
9272,THE CONSOLATION.,"Then into transport starting from her trance,                      740"
9273,THE CONSOLATION.,"With love, and admiration, how she glows!"
9274,THE CONSOLATION.,This gorgeous apparatus! this display!
9275,THE CONSOLATION.,This ostentation of creative power!
9276,THE CONSOLATION.,This theatre!--what eye can take it in?
9277,THE CONSOLATION.,"By what divine enchantment was it raised,"
9278,THE CONSOLATION.,For minds of the first magnitude to launch
9279,THE CONSOLATION.,"In endless speculation, and adore?"
9280,THE CONSOLATION.,"One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine;"
9281,THE CONSOLATION.,And light us deep into the Deity;
9282,THE CONSOLATION.,How boundless in magnificence and might!                           750
9283,THE CONSOLATION.,"O what a confluence of ethereal fires,"
9284,THE CONSOLATION.,"Form urns unnumber'd, down the steep of heaven,"
9285,THE CONSOLATION.,"Streams to a point, and centres in my sight!"
9286,THE CONSOLATION.,Nor tarries there; I feel it at my heart.
9287,THE CONSOLATION.,"My heart, at once, it humbles, and exalts;"
9288,THE CONSOLATION.,"Lays it in dust, and calls it to the skies."
9289,THE CONSOLATION.,Who sees it unexalted? or unawed?
9290,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who sees it, and can stop at what is seen?"
9291,THE CONSOLATION.,Material offspring of Omnipotence!
9292,THE CONSOLATION.,"Inanimate, all-animating birth!                                    760"
9293,THE CONSOLATION.,Work worthy Him who made it! worthy praise!
9294,THE CONSOLATION.,All praise! praise more than human! nor denied                     762
9295,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thy praise divine!--But though man, drown'd in sleep,"
9296,THE CONSOLATION.,"Withholds his homage, not alone I wake;"
9297,THE CONSOLATION.,"Bright legions swarm unseen, and sing, unheard"
9298,THE CONSOLATION.,"By mortal ear, the glorious Architect,"
9299,THE CONSOLATION.,In this His universal temple hung
9300,THE CONSOLATION.,"With lustres, with innumerable lights,"
9301,THE CONSOLATION.,"That shed religion on the soul; at once,"
9302,THE CONSOLATION.,"The temple, and the preacher! O how loud                           770"
9303,THE CONSOLATION.,It calls devotion! genuine growth of Night!
9304,THE CONSOLATION.,Devotion! daughter of Astronomy!
9305,THE CONSOLATION.,An undevout astronomer is mad.
9306,THE CONSOLATION.,"True; all things speak a God; but in the small,"
9307,THE CONSOLATION.,"Men trace out Him; in great, He seizes man;"
9308,THE CONSOLATION.,"Seizes, and elevates, and wraps, and fills"
9309,THE CONSOLATION.,"With new inquiries, 'mid associates new."
9310,THE CONSOLATION.,"Tell me, ye stars! ye planets! tell me, all"
9311,THE CONSOLATION.,"Ye starr'd, and planeted, inhabitants! what is it?"
9312,THE CONSOLATION.,"What are these sons of wonder? say, proud arch                     780"
9313,THE CONSOLATION.,"(Within those azure palaces they dwell),"
9314,THE CONSOLATION.,Built with divine ambition! in disdain
9315,THE CONSOLATION.,Of limit built! built in the taste of heaven!
9316,THE CONSOLATION.,Vast concave! ample dome! wast thou design'd
9317,THE CONSOLATION.,A meet apartment for the Deity?--
9318,THE CONSOLATION.,"Not so; that thought alone thy state impairs,"
9319,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thy lofty sinks, and shallows thy profound,"
9320,THE CONSOLATION.,"And straitens thy diffusive; dwarfs the whole,"
9321,THE CONSOLATION.,And makes a universe an orrery[60].
9322,THE CONSOLATION.,"But when I drop mine eye, and look on man,                       790"
9323,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thy right regain'd, thy grandeur is restored,"
9324,THE CONSOLATION.,O Nature! wide flies off th' expanding round.
9325,THE CONSOLATION.,"As when whole magazines, at once, are fired,"
9326,THE CONSOLATION.,The smitten air is hollow'd by the blow;
9327,THE CONSOLATION.,The vast displosion dissipates the clouds;
9328,THE CONSOLATION.,Shock'd ether's billows dash the distant skies;                    796
9329,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thus (but far more) th' expanding round flies off,"
9330,THE CONSOLATION.,"And leaves a mighty void, a spacious womb,"
9331,THE CONSOLATION.,Might teem with new creation; reinflamed
9332,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thy luminaries triumph, and assume"
9333,THE CONSOLATION.,"Divinity themselves. Nor was it strange,"
9334,THE CONSOLATION.,"Matter high-wrought to such surprising pomp,"
9335,THE CONSOLATION.,"Such godlike glory, stole the style of gods,                       803"
9336,THE CONSOLATION.,"From ages dark, obtuse, and steep'd in sense;"
9337,THE CONSOLATION.,"For, sure, to sense, they truly are divine,"
9338,THE CONSOLATION.,And half absolved idolatry from guilt;
9339,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nay, turn'd it into virtue. Such it was"
9340,THE CONSOLATION.,"In those, who put forth all they had of man"
9341,THE CONSOLATION.,"Unlost, to lift their thought, nor mounted higher;"
9342,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, weak of wing, on planets perch'd; and thought                 810"
9343,THE CONSOLATION.,"What was their highest, must be their adored."
9344,THE CONSOLATION.,"But they how weak, who could no higher mount?"
9345,THE CONSOLATION.,"And are there, then, Lorenzo! those, to whom"
9346,THE CONSOLATION.,"Unseen, and unexistent, are the same?"
9347,THE CONSOLATION.,"And if incomprehensible is join'd,"
9348,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who dare pronounce it madness, to believe?"
9349,THE CONSOLATION.,Why has the mighty Builder thrown aside
9350,THE CONSOLATION.,All measure in His work; stretch'd out His line
9351,THE CONSOLATION.,"So far, and spread amazement o'er the whole?"
9352,THE CONSOLATION.,"Then (as he took delight in wide extremes),                        820"
9353,THE CONSOLATION.,"Deep in the bosom of His universe,"
9354,THE CONSOLATION.,"Dropp'd down that reasoning mite, that insect, Man,"
9355,THE CONSOLATION.,"To crawl, and gaze, and wonder at the scene?--"
9356,THE CONSOLATION.,That man might ne'er presume to plead amazement
9357,THE CONSOLATION.,For disbelief of wonders in himself.
9358,THE CONSOLATION.,"Shall God be less miraculous, than what"
9359,THE CONSOLATION.,His hand has form'd? Shall mysteries descend
9360,THE CONSOLATION.,"From unmysterious? things more elevate,"
9361,THE CONSOLATION.,Be more familiar? uncreated lie
9362,THE CONSOLATION.,"More obvious than created, to the grasp                            830"
9363,THE CONSOLATION.,Of human thought? The more of wonderful
9364,THE CONSOLATION.,"Is heard in Him, the more we should assent."
9365,THE CONSOLATION.,"Could we conceive Him, God He could not be;"
9366,THE CONSOLATION.,"Or He not God, or we could not be men."
9367,THE CONSOLATION.,A God alone can comprehend a God;
9368,THE CONSOLATION.,"Man's distance how immense! On such a theme,"
9369,THE CONSOLATION.,"Know this, Lorenzo! (seem it ne'er so strange)"
9370,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nothing can satisfy, but what confounds;"
9371,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nothing, but what astonishes, is true."
9372,THE CONSOLATION.,"The scene thou seest, attests the truth I sing,                    840"
9373,THE CONSOLATION.,And every star sheds light upon thy creed.
9374,THE CONSOLATION.,"These stars, this furniture, this cost of heaven,"
9375,THE CONSOLATION.,"If but reported, thou hadst ne'er believed;"
9376,THE CONSOLATION.,"But thine eye tells thee, the romance is true."
9377,THE CONSOLATION.,"The grand of nature is th' Almighty's oath,"
9378,THE CONSOLATION.,"In Reason's court, to silence Unbelief."
9379,THE CONSOLATION.,"How my mind, opening at this scene, imbibes"
9380,THE CONSOLATION.,"The moral emanations of the skies,"
9381,THE CONSOLATION.,"While nought, perhaps, Lorenzo less admires!"
9382,THE CONSOLATION.,Has the Great Sovereign sent ten thousand worlds                   850
9383,THE CONSOLATION.,"To tells us, He resides above them all,"
9384,THE CONSOLATION.,In glory's unapproachable recess?
9385,THE CONSOLATION.,And dare earth's bold inhabitants deny
9386,THE CONSOLATION.,"The sumptuous, the magnific embassy"
9387,THE CONSOLATION.,"A moment's audience? Turn we, nor will hear"
9388,THE CONSOLATION.,"From whom they come, or what they would impart"
9389,THE CONSOLATION.,For man's emolument; sole cause that stoops
9390,THE CONSOLATION.,Their grandeur to man's eye? Lorenzo! rouse;
9391,THE CONSOLATION.,"Let thought, awaken'd, take the lightning's wing,"
9392,THE CONSOLATION.,"And glance from east to west, from pole to pole.                   860"
9393,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who sees, but is confounded, or convinced?"
9394,THE CONSOLATION.,"Renounces reason, or a God adores?"
9395,THE CONSOLATION.,Mankind was sent into the world to see:
9396,THE CONSOLATION.,Sight gives the science needful to their peace;                    864
9397,THE CONSOLATION.,That obvious science asks small learning's aid.
9398,THE CONSOLATION.,Would'st thou on metaphysic pinions soar?
9399,THE CONSOLATION.,Or wound thy patience amid logic thorns?
9400,THE CONSOLATION.,Or travel history's enormous round?
9401,THE CONSOLATION.,Nature no such hard task enjoins: she gave
9402,THE CONSOLATION.,A make to man directive of his thought;
9403,THE CONSOLATION.,"A make set upright, pointing to the stars,"
9404,THE CONSOLATION.,"As who shall say, ""Read thy chief lesson there.""                   872"
9405,THE CONSOLATION.,"Too late to read this manuscript of heaven,"
9406,THE CONSOLATION.,"When, like a parchment scroll, shrunk up by flames,"
9407,THE CONSOLATION.,It folds Lorenzo's lesson from his sight.
9408,THE CONSOLATION.,"Lesson how various! Not the God alone,"
9409,THE CONSOLATION.,"I see His ministers; I see, diffused"
9410,THE CONSOLATION.,"In radiant orders, essences sublime,"
9411,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of various offices, of various plume,"
9412,THE CONSOLATION.,"In heavenly liveries, distinctly clad,                             880"
9413,THE CONSOLATION.,"Azure, green, purple, pearl, or downy gold,"
9414,THE CONSOLATION.,"Or all commix'd; they stand, with wings outspread,"
9415,THE CONSOLATION.,"Listening to catch the Master's least command,"
9416,THE CONSOLATION.,"And fly through nature, ere the moment ends;"
9417,THE CONSOLATION.,Numbers innumerable!--well conceived
9418,THE CONSOLATION.,"By Pagan, and by Christian! O'er each sphere"
9419,THE CONSOLATION.,"Presides an angel, to direct its course,"
9420,THE CONSOLATION.,"And feed, or fan, its flames; or to discharge"
9421,THE CONSOLATION.,Other high trusts unknown. For who can see
9422,THE CONSOLATION.,"Such pomp of matter, and imagine, Mind,                            890"
9423,THE CONSOLATION.,"For which alone Inanimate was made,"
9424,THE CONSOLATION.,"More sparingly dispensed? that nobler son,"
9425,THE CONSOLATION.,Far liker the great Sire!--'Tis thus the skies
9426,THE CONSOLATION.,"Inform us of superiors numberless,"
9427,THE CONSOLATION.,"As much, in excellence, above mankind,"
9428,THE CONSOLATION.,"As above earth, in magnitude, the spheres."
9429,THE CONSOLATION.,"These, as a cloud of witnesses, hang o'er us;"
9430,THE CONSOLATION.,In a throng'd theatre are all our deeds;                           898
9431,THE CONSOLATION.,"Perhaps, a thousand demigods descend"
9432,THE CONSOLATION.,"On every beam we see, to walk with men."
9433,THE CONSOLATION.,Awful reflection! Strong restraint from ill!
9434,THE CONSOLATION.,"Yet, here, our virtue finds still stronger aid"
9435,THE CONSOLATION.,From these ethereal glories sense surveys.
9436,THE CONSOLATION.,"Something, like magic, strikes from this blue vault;"
9437,THE CONSOLATION.,With just attention is it view'd? We feel
9438,THE CONSOLATION.,"A sudden succour, unimplored, unthought;"
9439,THE CONSOLATION.,Nature herself does half the work of Man.
9440,THE CONSOLATION.,"Seas, rivers, mountains, forests, deserts, rocks,"
9441,THE CONSOLATION.,"The promontory's height, the depth profound"
9442,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of subterranean, excavated grots[61],                              910"
9443,THE CONSOLATION.,"Black brow'd, and vaulted high, and yawning wide"
9444,THE CONSOLATION.,"From Nature's structure, or the scoop of Time;"
9445,THE CONSOLATION.,"If ample of dimension, vast of size,"
9446,THE CONSOLATION.,Even these an aggrandizing impulse give;
9447,THE CONSOLATION.,Of solemn thought enthusiastic heights
9448,THE CONSOLATION.,Even these infuse.--But what of vast in these?
9449,THE CONSOLATION.,Nothing;--or we must own the skies forgot.
9450,THE CONSOLATION.,Much less in art.--Vain art! Thou pigmy power!
9451,THE CONSOLATION.,"How dost thou swell and strut, with human pride,"
9452,THE CONSOLATION.,"To show thy littleness! What childish toys,                        920"
9453,THE CONSOLATION.,Thy watery columns squirted to the clouds!
9454,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thy basin'd rivers, and imprison'd seas!"
9455,THE CONSOLATION.,Thy mountains moulded into forms of men!
9456,THE CONSOLATION.,Thy hundred-gated capitals! or those
9457,THE CONSOLATION.,Where three days' travel left us much to ride;
9458,THE CONSOLATION.,"Gazing on miracles by mortals wrought,"
9459,THE CONSOLATION.,"Arches triumphal, theatres immense,"
9460,THE CONSOLATION.,Or nodding gardens pendent in mid-air!
9461,THE CONSOLATION.,Or temples proud to meet their gods half-way!
9462,THE CONSOLATION.,Yet these affect us in no common kind.                             930
9463,THE CONSOLATION.,What then the force of such superior scenes?
9464,THE CONSOLATION.,"Enter a temple, it will strike an awe:                             932"
9465,THE CONSOLATION.,What awe from this the Deity has built!
9466,THE CONSOLATION.,"A good man seen, though silent, counsel gives:"
9467,THE CONSOLATION.,The touch'd spectator wishes to be wise:
9468,THE CONSOLATION.,"In a bright mirror His own hands have made,"
9469,THE CONSOLATION.,Here we see something like the face of God.
9470,THE CONSOLATION.,"Seems it not then enough, to say, Lorenzo!"
9471,THE CONSOLATION.,"To man abandon'd, ""Hast thou seen the skies?"""
9472,THE CONSOLATION.,"And yet, so thwarted Nature's kind design                        940"
9473,THE CONSOLATION.,"By daring man, he makes her sacred awe"
9474,THE CONSOLATION.,"(That guard from ill) his shelter, his temptation"
9475,THE CONSOLATION.,"To more than common guilt, and quite inverts"
9476,THE CONSOLATION.,Celestial art's intent. The trembling stars
9477,THE CONSOLATION.,"See crimes gigantic, stalking through the gloom"
9478,THE CONSOLATION.,"With front erect, that hide their head by day,"
9479,THE CONSOLATION.,And making night still darker by their deeds.
9480,THE CONSOLATION.,"Slumbering in covert, till the shades descend,"
9481,THE CONSOLATION.,"Rapine and Murder, link'd, now prowl for prey."
9482,THE CONSOLATION.,"The miser earths his treasure; and the thief,                      950"
9483,THE CONSOLATION.,"Watching the mole, half beggars him ere morn."
9484,THE CONSOLATION.,"Now plots, and foul conspiracies, awake;"

9489,THE CONSOLATION.,What shall I do?--suppress it? or proclaim?--
9490,THE CONSOLATION.,"Why sleeps the thunder? Now, Lorenzo! now,"
9491,THE CONSOLATION.,His best friend's couch the rank adulterer
9492,THE CONSOLATION.,Ascends secure; and laughs at gods and men.                        960
9493,THE CONSOLATION.,"Preposterous madmen, void of fear or shame,"

9499,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of human hearts, and wiser make the wise."
9500,THE CONSOLATION.,Those ends were answer'd once; when mortals lived
9501,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of stronger wing, of aquiline ascent"
9502,THE CONSOLATION.,In theory sublime. O how unlike
9503,THE CONSOLATION.,"Those vermin of the night, this moment sung,"
9504,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who crawl on earth, and on her venom feed!                         972"
9505,THE CONSOLATION.,"Those ancient sages, human stars! They met"

9549,THE CONSOLATION.,And what more true? what truth of greater weight?
9550,THE CONSOLATION.,The soul of man was made to walk the skies;
9551,THE CONSOLATION.,Delightful outlet of her prison here!

9567,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, feeling, emulates her country's praise."
9568,THE CONSOLATION.,"What call we, then, the firmament, Lorenzo?--"
9569,THE CONSOLATION.,"As earth the body, since the skies sustain"

9571,THE CONSOLATION.,"Call it, the noble pasture of the mind;"
9572,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which there expatiates, strengthens, and exults,                  1040"

9622,THE CONSOLATION.,"To prudent pomp, magnificently wise.                              1090"
9623,THE CONSOLATION.,How rich the prospect! and for ever new!
9624,THE CONSOLATION.,And newest to the man that views it most;
9625,THE CONSOLATION.,For newer still in infinite succeeds.
9626,THE CONSOLATION.,"Then, these aërial racers, O how swift!"
9627,THE CONSOLATION.,How the shaft loiters from the strongest string!
9628,THE CONSOLATION.,Spirit alone can distance the career.
9629,THE CONSOLATION.,Orb above orb ascending without end!

9635,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of worlds, that laugh at earth! immensely great!"
9636,THE CONSOLATION.,Immensely distant from each other's spheres!
9637,THE CONSOLATION.,"What, then, the wondrous space through which they roll?"
9638,THE CONSOLATION.,At once it quite engulfs all human thought;
9639,THE CONSOLATION.,'Tis comprehension's absolute defeat.
9640,THE CONSOLATION.,Nor think thou seest a wild disorder here;
9641,THE CONSOLATION.,"Through this illustrious chaos to the sight,"

9643,THE CONSOLATION.,"The path prescribed, inviolably kept,"
9644,THE CONSOLATION.,Upbraids the lawless sallies of mankind.
9645,THE CONSOLATION.,"Worlds, ever thwarting, never interfere;"
9646,THE CONSOLATION.,"What knots are tied! how soon are they dissolved,"
9647,THE CONSOLATION.,And set the seeming married planets free!
9648,THE CONSOLATION.,"They rove for ever, without error rove;"
9649,THE CONSOLATION.,Confusion unconfused! nor less admire

9657,THE CONSOLATION.,"In exultation to their God, and thine,"
9658,THE CONSOLATION.,"They dance, they sing eternal jubilee,"
9659,THE CONSOLATION.,Eternal celebration of His praise.
9660,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, since their song arrives not at our ear,"
9661,THE CONSOLATION.,Their dance perplex'd exhibits to the sight
9662,THE CONSOLATION.,Fair hieroglyphic of His peerless power.                          1130
9663,THE CONSOLATION.,"Mark how the labyrinthian turns they take,"
9664,THE CONSOLATION.,"The circles intricate, and mystic maze,"
9665,THE CONSOLATION.,Weave the grand cipher of Omnipotence;                            1133
9666,THE CONSOLATION.,"To gods, how great! how legible to man!"
9667,THE CONSOLATION.,Leaves so much wonder greater wonder still?
9668,THE CONSOLATION.,Where are the pillars that support the skies?
9669,THE CONSOLATION.,What more than Atlantean shoulder props
9670,THE CONSOLATION.,"Th' incumbent load? What magic, what strange art,"
9671,THE CONSOLATION.,In fluid air these ponderous orbs sustains?
9672,THE CONSOLATION.,Who would not think them hung in golden chains?--                 1140
9673,THE CONSOLATION.,"And so they are; in the high will of heaven,"
9674,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which fixes all; makes adamant of air,"
9675,THE CONSOLATION.,"Or air of adamant; makes all of nought,"
9676,THE CONSOLATION.,Or nought of all; if such the dread decree.
9677,THE CONSOLATION.,Imagine from their deep foundations torn
9678,THE CONSOLATION.,"The most gigantic sons of earth, the broad"
9679,THE CONSOLATION.,"And towering Alps, all toss'd into the sea;"
9680,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, light as down, or volatile as air,"
9681,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their bulks enormous, dancing on the waves,"
9682,THE CONSOLATION.,"In time, and measure, exquisite; while all                        1150"
9683,THE CONSOLATION.,"The winds, in emulation of the spheres,"
9684,THE CONSOLATION.,Tune their sonorous instruments aloft;
9685,THE CONSOLATION.,"The concert swell, and animate the ball."
9686,THE CONSOLATION.,"Would this appear amazing? What, then, worlds,"
9687,THE CONSOLATION.,"In a far thinner element sustain'd,"
9688,THE CONSOLATION.,"And acting the same part, with greater skill,"
9689,THE CONSOLATION.,"More rapid movement, and for noblest ends?"
9690,THE CONSOLATION.,"More obvious ends to pass, are not these stars"
9691,THE CONSOLATION.,"The seats majestic, proud imperial thrones,"
9692,THE CONSOLATION.,"On which angelic delegates of heaven,                             1160"
9693,THE CONSOLATION.,"At certain periods, as the Sovereign nods,"
9694,THE CONSOLATION.,"Discharge high trusts of vengeance, or of love;"
9695,THE CONSOLATION.,"To clothe, in outward grandeur, grand design,"
9696,THE CONSOLATION.,And acts most solemn still more solemnize?
9697,THE CONSOLATION.,"Ye citizens of air! what ardent thanks,"
9698,THE CONSOLATION.,"What full effusion of the grateful heart,"
9699,THE CONSOLATION.,Is due from man indulged in such a sight!                         1167
9700,THE CONSOLATION.,A sight so noble! and a sight so kind!
9701,THE CONSOLATION.,It drops new truths at every new survey!
9702,THE CONSOLATION.,"Feels not Lorenzo something stir within,"
9703,THE CONSOLATION.,That sweeps away all period? As these spheres
9704,THE CONSOLATION.,"Measure duration, they no less inspire"
9705,THE CONSOLATION.,The godlike hope of ages without end.
9706,THE CONSOLATION.,"The boundless space, through which these rovers take"
9707,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their restless roam, suggests the sister thought"
9708,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of boundless time. Thus, by kind Nature's skill,"
9709,THE CONSOLATION.,"To man unlabour'd, that important guest,"
9710,THE CONSOLATION.,"Eternity, finds entrance at the sight:"
9711,THE CONSOLATION.,"And an eternity, for man ordain'd,"

9713,THE CONSOLATION.,"The stars, had never whisper'd it to man."
9714,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nature informs, but ne'er insults, her sons."
9715,THE CONSOLATION.,Could she then kindle the most ardent wish
9716,THE CONSOLATION.,To disappoint it?--That is blasphemy.
9717,THE CONSOLATION.,"Thus, of thy creed a second article,"
9718,THE CONSOLATION.,"Momentous, as th' existence of a God,"
9719,THE CONSOLATION.,Is found (as I conceive) where rarely sought;
9720,THE CONSOLATION.,"And thou may'st read thy soul immortal, here."
9721,THE CONSOLATION.,"Here, then, Lorenzo! on these glories dwell;"
9722,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor want the gilt, illuminated, roof,                             1190"
9723,THE CONSOLATION.,That calls the wretched gay to dark delights.
9724,THE CONSOLATION.,Assemblies?--This is one divinely bright;
9725,THE CONSOLATION.,"Here, unendanger'd in health, wealth, or fame,"
9726,THE CONSOLATION.,"Range through the fairest, and the Sultan scorn;"
9727,THE CONSOLATION.,"He, wise as thou, no crescent holds so fair,"
9728,THE CONSOLATION.,"As that, which on his turban awes a world;"
9729,THE CONSOLATION.,And thinks the moon is proud to copy him.
9730,THE CONSOLATION.,"Look on her, and gain more than worlds can give,"
9731,THE CONSOLATION.,A mind superior to the charms of power.
9732,THE CONSOLATION.,Thou muffled in delusions of this life!                           1200
9733,THE CONSOLATION.,"Can yonder moon turn ocean in his bed,                            1201"
9734,THE CONSOLATION.,"From side to side, in constant ebb, and flow,"
9735,THE CONSOLATION.,And purify from stench his watery realms?
9736,THE CONSOLATION.,And fails her moral influence? wants she power
9737,THE CONSOLATION.,To turn Lorenzo's stubborn tide of thought
9738,THE CONSOLATION.,"From stagnating on earth's infected shore,"
9739,THE CONSOLATION.,And purge from nuisance his corrupted heart?
9740,THE CONSOLATION.,Fails her attraction when it draws to heaven?
9741,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nay, and to what thou valuest more, earth's joy?"
9742,THE CONSOLATION.,"Minds elevate, and panting for unseen,                            1210"

9744,THE CONSOLATION.,"Full relish of existence undeflower'd,"
9745,THE CONSOLATION.,"The life of life, the zest of worldly bliss:"
9746,THE CONSOLATION.,All else on earth amounts--to what? to this:
9747,THE CONSOLATION.,"""Bad to be suffer'd; blessings to be left:"""
9748,THE CONSOLATION.,Earth's richest inventory boasts no more.
9749,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of higher scenes be, then, the call obey'd."
9750,THE CONSOLATION.,O let me gaze!--Of gazing there's no end.
9751,THE CONSOLATION.,O let me think!--Thought too is wilder'd here;
9752,THE CONSOLATION.,In midway flight imagination tires;                               1220
9753,THE CONSOLATION.,"Yet soon reprunes her wing to soar anew,"
9754,THE CONSOLATION.,"Her point unable to forbear, or gain;"
9755,THE CONSOLATION.,"So great the pleasure, so profound the plan!"
9756,THE CONSOLATION.,"A banquet, this, where men, and angels, meet,"
9757,THE CONSOLATION.,"Eat the same manna, mingle earth and heaven."
9758,THE CONSOLATION.,How distant some of these nocturnal suns!
9759,THE CONSOLATION.,"So distant (says the sage), 'twere not absurd"
9760,THE CONSOLATION.,"To doubt, if beams, set out at Nature's birth,"
9761,THE CONSOLATION.,Are yet arrived at this so foreign world;
9762,THE CONSOLATION.,Though nothing half so rapid as their flight.                     1230
9763,THE CONSOLATION.,"An eye of awe and wonder let me roll,"
9764,THE CONSOLATION.,And roll for ever: who can satiate sight
9765,THE CONSOLATION.,In such a scene? in such an ocean wide
9766,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of deep astonishment? where depth, height, breadth,"
9767,THE CONSOLATION.,Are lost in their extremes; and where to count                    1235
9768,THE CONSOLATION.,"The thick-sown glories in this field of fire,"
9769,THE CONSOLATION.,Perhaps a seraph's computation fails.
9770,THE CONSOLATION.,"Now, go, Ambition! boast thy boundless might"
9771,THE CONSOLATION.,"In conquest, o'er the tenth part of a grain."
9772,THE CONSOLATION.,"And yet Lorenzo calls for miracles,"
9773,THE CONSOLATION.,To give his tottering faith a solid base.
9774,THE CONSOLATION.,Why call for less than is already thine?                          1242
9775,THE CONSOLATION.,Thou art no novice in theology;
9776,THE CONSOLATION.,"What is a miracle?--'Tis a reproach,"
9777,THE CONSOLATION.,"'Tis an implicit satire, on mankind;"
9778,THE CONSOLATION.,"And while it satisfies, it censures too."
9779,THE CONSOLATION.,"To common sense, great Nature's course proclaims"
9780,THE CONSOLATION.,"A Deity: when mankind falls asleep,"
9781,THE CONSOLATION.,"A miracle is sent, as an alarm;"

9783,THE CONSOLATION.,"By recent argument, but not more strong."
9784,THE CONSOLATION.,"Say, which imports more plenitude of power,"
9785,THE CONSOLATION.,"Or nature's laws to fix, or to repeal?"

9793,THE CONSOLATION.,From Adam's bower look down through the whole train
9794,THE CONSOLATION.,Of miracles;--resistless is their power?
9795,THE CONSOLATION.,"They do not, can not, more amaze the mind,"
9796,THE CONSOLATION.,"Than this, call'd unmiraculous survey,"
9797,THE CONSOLATION.,"If duly weigh'd, if rationally seen,"
9798,THE CONSOLATION.,"If seen with human eyes. The brute, indeed,"

9800,THE CONSOLATION.,"Say'st thou, ""The course of nature governs all?"""
9801,THE CONSOLATION.,The course of Nature is the art of God.                           1269
9802,THE CONSOLATION.,"The miracles thou call'st for, this attest;"
9803,THE CONSOLATION.,"For say, could Nature Nature's course control?"
9804,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, miracles apart, who sees Him not,"

9878,THE CONSOLATION.,"Dost think, Lorenzo, this is wandering wide?"
9879,THE CONSOLATION.,"No,'tis directly striking at the mark;"
9880,THE CONSOLATION.,To wake thy dead devotion was my point;

9883,THE CONSOLATION.,"Fill us with great ideas, full of heaven,"
9884,THE CONSOLATION.,And antidote the pestilential earth!
9885,THE CONSOLATION.,"In every storm, that either frowns, or falls,"
9886,THE CONSOLATION.,What an asylum has the soul in prayer!
9887,THE CONSOLATION.,"And what a fane[68] is this, in which to pray!"

9904,THE CONSOLATION.,"Fill'd with an atom! fill'd, and foul'd, with self!"
9905,THE CONSOLATION.,"And self mistaken! self, that lasts an hour!"
9906,THE CONSOLATION.,"Instincts and passions, of the nobler kind,"

9910,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where order, wisdom, goodness, providence,"
9911,THE CONSOLATION.,"Their endless miracles of love display,"
9912,THE CONSOLATION.,And promise all the truly great desire.                           1380
9913,THE CONSOLATION.,"The mind that would be happy, must be great;"
9914,THE CONSOLATION.,"Great, in its wishes; great, in its surveys."
9915,THE CONSOLATION.,Extended views a narrow mind extend;
9916,THE CONSOLATION.,"Push out its corrugate, expansive make,"
9917,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which, ere long, more than planets shall embrace."
9918,THE CONSOLATION.,A man of compass makes a man of worth;
9919,THE CONSOLATION.,"Divine contemplate, and become divine."
9920,THE CONSOLATION.,"As man was made for glory, and for bliss,"
9921,THE CONSOLATION.,All littleness is in approach to woe;
9922,THE CONSOLATION.,"Open thy bosom, set thy wishes wide,                              1390"
9923,THE CONSOLATION.,And let in manhood; let in happiness;

9926,THE CONSOLATION.,"Take God from nature, nothing great is left;"
9927,THE CONSOLATION.,"Man's mind is in a pit, and nothing sees;"
9928,THE CONSOLATION.,"Man's heart is in a jakes[69], and loves the mire."
9929,THE CONSOLATION.,Emerge from thy profound; erect thine eye;
9930,THE CONSOLATION.,See thy distress! how close art thou besieged!
9931,THE CONSOLATION.,"Besieged by Nature, the proud sceptic's foe!"

9933,THE CONSOLATION.,"Sparkling conviction on the darkest mind,"
9934,THE CONSOLATION.,As in a golden net of Providence.
9935,THE CONSOLATION.,"How art thou caught, sure captive of belief!"
9936,THE CONSOLATION.,"From this thy bless'd captivity, what art,"
9937,THE CONSOLATION.,"What blasphemy to reason, sets thee free!                         1405"
9938,THE CONSOLATION.,This scene is heaven's indulgent violence:
9939,THE CONSOLATION.,Canst thou bear up against this tide of glory?
9940,THE CONSOLATION.,"What is earth bosom'd in these ambient orbs,"
9941,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, faith in God imposed, and press'd on man?"
9942,THE CONSOLATION.,"Darest thou still litigate thy desperate cause,"
9943,THE CONSOLATION.,"Spite of these numerous, awful, witnesses,"
9944,THE CONSOLATION.,And doubt the deposition of the skies?                            1412
9945,THE CONSOLATION.,O how laborious is thy way to ruin!
9946,THE CONSOLATION.,Laborious! 'tis impracticable quite;
9947,THE CONSOLATION.,"To sink beyond a doubt, in this debate,"
9948,THE CONSOLATION.,"With all his weight of wisdom and of will,"
9949,THE CONSOLATION.,"And crime flagitious, I defy a fool."
9950,THE CONSOLATION.,Some wish they did; but no man disbelieves.
9951,THE CONSOLATION.,God is a spirit; spirit cannot strike
9952,THE CONSOLATION.,"These gross, material organs; God by man                          1420"
9953,THE CONSOLATION.,"As much is seen, as man a God can see,"
9954,THE CONSOLATION.,In these astonishing exploits of power.
9955,THE CONSOLATION.,"What order, beauty, motion, distance, size!"
9956,THE CONSOLATION.,"Concertion of design, how exquisite!"
9957,THE CONSOLATION.,"How complicate, in their divine police!"
9958,THE CONSOLATION.,Apt means! great ends! consent to general good!--
9959,THE CONSOLATION.,"Each attribute of these material gods,"
9960,THE CONSOLATION.,"So long (and that with specious pleas) adored,"
9961,THE CONSOLATION.,A separate conquest gains o'er rebel thought;
9962,THE CONSOLATION.,And leads in triumph the whole mind of man.                       1430
9963,THE CONSOLATION.,Lorenzo! this may seem harangue to thee;
9964,THE CONSOLATION.,"Such all is apt to seem, that thwarts our will."
9965,THE CONSOLATION.,"And dost thou, then, demand a simple proof"
9966,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of this great master moral of the skies,"
9967,THE CONSOLATION.,"Unskill'd, or disinclined, to read it there?"
9968,THE CONSOLATION.,"Since 'tis the basis, and all drops without it,"
9969,THE CONSOLATION.,"Take it, in one compact, unbroken chain."
9970,THE CONSOLATION.,Such proof insists on an attentive ear;
9971,THE CONSOLATION.,"'Twill not make one amid a mob of thoughts,                       1439"
9972,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, for thy notice, struggle with the world."
9973,THE CONSOLATION.,Retire;--the world shut out;--thy thoughts call home;--
9974,THE CONSOLATION.,Imagination's airy wing repress;--
9975,THE CONSOLATION.,Lock up thy senses;--let no passion stir;--
9976,THE CONSOLATION.,Wake all to Reason;--let her reign alone;--
9977,THE CONSOLATION.,"Then, in thy soul's deep silence, and the depth"
9978,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of Nature's silence, midnight, thus inquire,"
9979,THE CONSOLATION.,As I have done; and shall inquire no more.
9980,THE CONSOLATION.,"In nature's channel, thus the questions run:"
9981,THE CONSOLATION.,"""What am I? and from whence?--I nothing know,"
9982,THE CONSOLATION.,"But that I am; and, since I am, conclude                          1450"
9983,THE CONSOLATION.,"Something eternal: had there e'er been nought,"
9984,THE CONSOLATION.,Nought still had been: eternal there must be.--
9985,THE CONSOLATION.,But what eternal?--Why not human race?
9986,THE CONSOLATION.,And Adam's ancestors without an end?--
9987,THE CONSOLATION.,That's hard to be conceived; since every link
9988,THE CONSOLATION.,Of that long-chain'd succession is so frail;
9989,THE CONSOLATION.,"Can every part depend, and not the whole?"
9990,THE CONSOLATION.,Yet grant it true; new difficulties rise;
9991,THE CONSOLATION.,I'm still quite out at sea; nor see the shore.
9992,THE CONSOLATION.,"Whence earth, and these bright orbs?--eternal too?"
9993,THE CONSOLATION.,Grant matter was eternal; still these orbs                        1461
9994,THE CONSOLATION.,Would want some other father;--much design
9995,THE CONSOLATION.,"Is seen in all their motions, all their makes;"
9996,THE CONSOLATION.,"Design implies intelligence, and art;"
9997,THE CONSOLATION.,That can't be from themselves--or man; that art
9998,THE CONSOLATION.,"Man scarce can comprehend, could man bestow?"
9999,THE CONSOLATION.,And nothing greater yet allow'd than man.--
10000,THE CONSOLATION.,"Who, motion, foreign to the smallest grain,"
10001,THE CONSOLATION.,Shot through vast masses of enormous weight?
10002,THE CONSOLATION.,Who bid brute matter's restive lump assume                        1470
10003,THE CONSOLATION.,"Such various forms, and gave it wings to fly?"
10004,THE CONSOLATION.,"Has matter innate motion? then each atom,"
10005,THE CONSOLATION.,Asserting its indisputable right                                  1473
10006,THE CONSOLATION.,"To dance, would form an universe of dust:"
10007,THE CONSOLATION.,Has matter none? Then whence these glorious forms
10008,THE CONSOLATION.,"And boundless flights, from shapeless, and reposed?"
10009,THE CONSOLATION.,"Has matter more than motion? Has it thought,"
10010,THE CONSOLATION.,"Judgment, and genius? Is it deeply learn'd"
10011,THE CONSOLATION.,"In mathematics? Has it framed such laws,"
10012,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which but to guess, a Newton made immortal?--                     1480"
10013,THE CONSOLATION.,"If so, how each sage atom laughs at me,"
10014,THE CONSOLATION.,Who think a clod inferior to a man!
10015,THE CONSOLATION.,"If art, to form; and counsel, to conduct;"
10016,THE CONSOLATION.,And that with greater far than human skill;
10017,THE CONSOLATION.,Resides not in each block;--a Godhead reigns.--
10018,THE CONSOLATION.,"Grant, then, invisible, eternal, Mind;"
10019,THE CONSOLATION.,"That granted, all is solved.--But, granting that,"
10020,THE CONSOLATION.,Draw I not o'er me a still darker cloud?
10021,THE CONSOLATION.,Grant I not that which I can ne'er conceive?
10022,THE CONSOLATION.,"A being without origin, or end!--                                 1490"
10023,THE CONSOLATION.,"Hail, human liberty! There is no God--"
10024,THE CONSOLATION.,"Yet, why? On either scheme that knot subsists;"
10025,THE CONSOLATION.,"Subsist it must, in God, or human race;"
10026,THE CONSOLATION.,"If in the last, how many knots beside,"
10027,THE CONSOLATION.,"Indissoluble all?--Why choose it there,"
10028,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where, chosen, still subsist ten thousand more?"
10029,THE CONSOLATION.,"Reject it, where, that chosen, all the rest"
10030,THE CONSOLATION.,"Dispersed, leave reason's whole horizon clear?"
10031,THE CONSOLATION.,"This is not reason's dictate; Reason says,"
10032,THE CONSOLATION.,Close with the side where one grain turns the scale;--            1500
10033,THE CONSOLATION.,What vast preponderance is here! can reason
10034,THE CONSOLATION.,With louder voice exclaim--Believe a God?
10035,THE CONSOLATION.,"And reason heard, is the sole mark of man."
10036,THE CONSOLATION.,"What things impossible must man think true,"
10037,THE CONSOLATION.,On any other system! and how strange
10038,THE CONSOLATION.,"To disbelieve, through mere credulity!"""
10039,THE CONSOLATION.,"If, in this chain, Lorenzo finds no flaw,                       1507"
10040,THE CONSOLATION.,Let it for ever bind him to belief.
10041,THE CONSOLATION.,"And where the link, in which a flaw he finds?"
10042,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, if a God there is, that God how great!"
10043,THE CONSOLATION.,"How great that Power, whose providential care"
10044,THE CONSOLATION.,Through these bright orbs' dark centres darts a ray!
10045,THE CONSOLATION.,Of nature universal threads the whole!
10046,THE CONSOLATION.,"And hangs creation, like a precious gem,"
10047,THE CONSOLATION.,"Though little, on the footstool of his throne!"
10048,THE CONSOLATION.,"That little gem, how large! A weight let fall"
10049,THE CONSOLATION.,"From a fix'd star, in ages can it reach"

10053,THE CONSOLATION.,Whose battlements look o'er into the vale
10054,THE CONSOLATION.,Of non-existence! Nothing's strange abode!
10055,THE CONSOLATION.,"Say, at what point of space Jehovah dropp'd"
10056,THE CONSOLATION.,"His slacken'd line, and laid his balance by;"
10057,THE CONSOLATION.,"Weigh'd worlds, and measured infinite, no more?"
10058,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where, rears His terminating pillar high"

10088,THE CONSOLATION.,"If 'tis an error, 'tis an error sprung"
10089,THE CONSOLATION.,"From noble root, high thought of the Most High."
10090,THE CONSOLATION.,But wherefore error? who can prove it such?--
10091,THE CONSOLATION.,He that can set Omnipotence a bound.
10092,THE CONSOLATION.,Can man conceive beyond what God can do?
10093,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nothing, but quite impossible is hard."
10094,THE CONSOLATION.,"He summons into being, with like ease,                            1560"
10095,THE CONSOLATION.,"A whole creation, and a single grain."
10096,THE CONSOLATION.,Speaks he the word? a thousand worlds are born!
10097,THE CONSOLATION.,A thousand worlds? there's space for millions more:

10099,THE CONSOLATION.,"Condemn me not, cold critic! but indulge"
10100,THE CONSOLATION.,The warm imagination: why condemn?
10101,THE CONSOLATION.,"Why not indulge such thoughts, as swell our hearts"
10102,THE CONSOLATION.,"With fuller admiration of that Power,"
10103,THE CONSOLATION.,Who gives our hearts with such high thoughts to swell?
10104,THE CONSOLATION.,Why not indulge in His augmented praise?                          1570
10105,THE CONSOLATION.,"Darts not His glory a still brighter ray,"
10106,THE CONSOLATION.,"The less is left to Chaos, and the realms"
10107,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of hideous Night, where Fancy strays aghast;                      1573"
10108,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, though most talkative, makes no report?"
10109,THE CONSOLATION.,Still seems my thought enormous? Think again;--
10110,THE CONSOLATION.,Experience' self shall aid thy lame belief.
10111,THE CONSOLATION.,Glasses (that revelation to the sight!)
10112,THE CONSOLATION.,Have they not led us in the deep disclose
10113,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of fine-spun nature, exquisitely small,"
10114,THE CONSOLATION.,"And, though demonstrated, still ill-conceived?                    1580"

10116,THE CONSOLATION.,"In magnitude, what mind can mount too far,"
10117,THE CONSOLATION.,"To keep the balance, and creation poise?"
10118,THE CONSOLATION.,Defect alone can err on such a theme;
10119,THE CONSOLATION.,"What is too great, if we the cause survey?"
10120,THE CONSOLATION.,"Stupendous Architect! Thou, Thou art all!"
10121,THE CONSOLATION.,"My soul flies up and down in thoughts of Thee,"
10122,THE CONSOLATION.,And finds herself but at the centre still!
10123,THE CONSOLATION.,"I AM, thy name! Existence, all thine own!"
10124,THE CONSOLATION.,"Creation's nothing; flatter'd much, if styled                     1590"
10125,THE CONSOLATION.,"""The thin, the fleeting atmosphere of God."""
10126,THE CONSOLATION.,O for the voice--of what? of whom?--What voice
10127,THE CONSOLATION.,"Can answer to my wants, in such ascent,"
10128,THE CONSOLATION.,As dares to deem one universe too small?
10129,THE CONSOLATION.,"Tell me, Lorenzo! (for now fancy glows;"
10130,THE CONSOLATION.,Fired in the vortex of almighty power)
10131,THE CONSOLATION.,"Is not this home creation, in the map"
10132,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of universal nature, as a speck,"
10133,THE CONSOLATION.,Like fair Britannia in our little ball;
10134,THE CONSOLATION.,"Exceeding fair, and glorious, for its size,                       1600"
10135,THE CONSOLATION.,"But, elsewhere, far outmeasured, far outshone?"
10136,THE CONSOLATION.,In fancy (for the fact beyond us lies)
10137,THE CONSOLATION.,"Canst thou not figure it, an isle, almost"
10138,THE CONSOLATION.,"Too small for notice, in the vast of being;"
10139,THE CONSOLATION.,Sever'd by mighty seas of unbuilt space
10140,THE CONSOLATION.,From other realms; from ample continents
10141,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of higher life, where nobler natives dwell;                       1607"
10142,THE CONSOLATION.,"Less northern, less remote from Deity,"
10143,THE CONSOLATION.,Glowing beneath the line of the Supreme;
10144,THE CONSOLATION.,"Where souls in excellence make haste, put forth"
10145,THE CONSOLATION.,Luxuriant growths; nor the late autumn wait
10146,THE CONSOLATION.,"Of human worth, but ripen soon to gods?"
10147,THE CONSOLATION.,Yet why drown fancy in such depths as these?
10148,THE CONSOLATION.,"Return, presumptuous rover! and confess"
10149,THE CONSOLATION.,"The bounds of man; nor blame them, as too small."
10150,THE CONSOLATION.,Enjoy we not full scope in what is seen?
10151,THE CONSOLATION.,Pull ample the dominions of the sun!
10152,THE CONSOLATION.,"Full glorious to behold! How far, how wide,"
10153,THE CONSOLATION.,"The matchless monarch, from his flaming throne,                   1619"
10154,THE CONSOLATION.,"Lavish of lustre, throws his beams about him,"
10155,THE CONSOLATION.,"Farther, and faster, than a thought can fly,"
10156,THE CONSOLATION.,And feeds his planets with eternal fires!
10157,THE CONSOLATION.,"This Heliopolis,[70] by greater far,"
10158,THE CONSOLATION.,"Than the proud tyrant of the Nile, was built;"
10159,THE CONSOLATION.,"And He alone, who built it, can destroy."
10160,THE CONSOLATION.,"Beyond this city, why strays human thought?"
10161,THE CONSOLATION.,"One wonderful, enough for man to know!"
10162,THE CONSOLATION.,One infinite! enough for man to range!
10163,THE CONSOLATION.,"One firmament, enough for man to read!"
10164,THE CONSOLATION.,O what voluminous instruction here!                               1630
10165,THE CONSOLATION.,What page of wisdom is denied him? None;
10166,THE CONSOLATION.,If learning his chief lesson makes him wise.
10167,THE CONSOLATION.,"Nor is instruction, here, our only gain;"
10168,THE CONSOLATION.,"There dwells a noble pathos in the skies,"
10169,THE CONSOLATION.,"Which warms our passions, proselytes our hearts."
10170,THE CONSOLATION.,How eloquently shines the glowing pole!
10171,THE CONSOLATION.,"With what authority it gives its charge,"
10172,THE CONSOLATION.,"Remonstrating great truths in style sublime,"
10173,THE CONSOLATION.,"Though silent, loud! heard earth around; above"
10174,THE CONSOLATION.,The planets heard; and not unheard in hell;                       1640
10175,THE CONSOLATION.,"Hell has her wonder, though too proud to praise."
10176,THE CONSOLATION.,"Is earth, then, more infernal? Has she those,"

11247,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"sources of formality."" Mr Gilfillan has none of the qualifications here"

11249,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"appreciated, nor his poetry more unreservedly admired, than by this"
11250,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,Presbyterian editor. The editorial work is done with true Christian
11251,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"liberality, and with the sympathy of a man of genius. The present volume"
11252,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"forms one of the new series of the ""English Poetical Classics,"" published"
11253,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,by Mr Nichol of Edinburgh. In typography and appearance they are very

11266,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"produced in such a style, are certainly worthy of a place in the best"

11276,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"was never issued before, and we are much mistaken if the series does not"
11277,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"obtain a large circulation. The volumes are issued in handsome style, and"
11278,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,every care will be taken to secure the accuracy of the editions. Mr

11304,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,their success with the public.

11308,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"When it was proposed that, at so low a price as a subscription of a"
11309,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"guinea in the year, six volumes, in a superior style of execution, would"
11310,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"be issued, we could not but admire the enterprise of the publisher, and"
11311,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,heartily wish all success to the undertaking.
11312,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,
11313,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"These volumes, the first in the series, fully justified our fondest"
11314,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"anticipations, and give large promise that this admirable publication"
11315,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"will secure, as it certainly deserves, extensive patronage. They are"
11316,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"issued in a very attractive style--in a large bold type, paper of the"
11317,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"best quality, and in neat and substantial binding. The editorial part of"
11318,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"the undertaking is carefully and ably executed. Indeed, we know no living"
11319,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,person who is better qualified to edit a uniform edition of the British
11320,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,Poets than the Rev. George Gilfillan. We tender to both the publisher and
11321,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,editor of this beautiful superior edition of the British Poets our
11322,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,grateful acknowledgments for commencing so important and valuable an
11323,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,undertaking.

11340,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"projected by Mr Nichol, the enterprising Edinburgh publisher, one or two"
11341,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,of the former volumes of which we have already had the pleasure of
11342,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"noticing. The design, and the style in which it was proposed to carry it"
11343,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"out, as indicated by the first volume of the series, elicited the"
11344,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"expression of our special admiration several months ago, and we have"
11345,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,pleasure in stating that the volume now before us is in every respect a
11346,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,worthy successor to those which have preceded it. We may observe that the
11347,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"critical dissertation prefixed, from the pen of Mr Gilfillan, is worth"

11353,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"volume forms a part. They are issued, as our readers are aware, under the"
11354,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,very efficient superintendence of George Gilfillan; and we cannot speak
11355,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"of them but in terms of the warmest approval; for, in point of form and"
11356,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"elegance, and correctness of typography, they are on a level with the"
11357,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"high-priced editions; and in point of price, they are on a level with the"
11358,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,most ordinary publications of popular works that have been got up for the
11359,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,"popular market. The enterprise is indeed a noble one, and we wish it all"

11384,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,quite the _ne plus ultra_ of elegance and correctness; and the price (six
11385,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,volumes for a guinea) is perhaps the very greatest marvel of this

11400,THE POETICAL WORKS OF,general appearance is far superior to what we could have at all expected
