30,NIELS EBBESEN.,
31,NIELS EBBESEN.,
32,NIELS EBBESEN.,"All his men the Count collects,"
33,NIELS EBBESEN.,And from Slesvig marched away;
34,NIELS EBBESEN.,Never such as host was seen
35,NIELS EBBESEN.,Or before or since that day.
36,NIELS EBBESEN.,
37,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Into Denmark marched the Count,"
38,NIELS EBBESEN.,Followed by so fair a band;
39,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Banners twenty-four they bore,"
40,NIELS EBBESEN.,Power like theirs might none withstand.
41,NIELS EBBESEN.,
42,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Gert the Count to Randers rode,"
43,NIELS EBBESEN.,To bad counsel lending ear;
44,NIELS EBBESEN.,"For from old it stood foretold,"
45,NIELS EBBESEN.,He should end there his career.
46,NIELS EBBESEN.,
47,NIELS EBBESEN.,"He would not the place avoid,"
48,NIELS EBBESEN.,But seemed bent to tempt his fate;
49,NIELS EBBESEN.,Of the rural lords and thanes
50,NIELS EBBESEN.,He the quarters up will beat.
51,NIELS EBBESEN.,
52,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Knights and freeborn men apart,"
53,NIELS EBBESEN.,There trooped eighteen thousand bows;
54,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Forty thousand made they all,"
55,NIELS EBBESEN.,Who could such a host oppose?
56,NIELS EBBESEN.,
57,NIELS EBBESEN.,To Niels Ebbesen the Count
58,NIELS EBBESEN.,Word to appear before him sent;
59,NIELS EBBESEN.,"And safe convoy him he gave,"
60,NIELS EBBESEN.,Which should doubt and fear prevent.
61,NIELS EBBESEN.,
62,NIELS EBBESEN.,Gert the Count met Ebbesen
63,NIELS EBBESEN.,North of Randers by the sea:
64,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Welcome be, Niels Ebbesen!"
65,NIELS EBBESEN.,Say how matters stand with thee.”
66,NIELS EBBESEN.,
67,NIELS EBBESEN.,"To Niels stretched the Count his hand,"
68,NIELS EBBESEN.,And to parleying straight they go;
69,NIELS EBBESEN.,"There was little then of jest,"
70,NIELS EBBESEN.,"And of dallying less, I trow."
71,NIELS EBBESEN.,
72,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Sir Niels Ebbesen, thou art"
73,NIELS EBBESEN.,Welcome as the flowers in spring;
74,NIELS EBBESEN.,"How stand minds in North Jutland,"
75,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thence what tidings dost thou bring?
76,NIELS EBBESEN.,
77,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Say how all thy wealthy friends
78,NIELS EBBESEN.,And thy heart’s loved lady are;
79,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Which dost wish for at my hands,"
80,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Smiling peace, or bloody war?”"
81,NIELS EBBESEN.,
82,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Well stand minds in North Jutland,"
83,NIELS EBBESEN.,Each man’s courage there’s erect;
84,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Say, dost come as friend or foe?"
85,NIELS EBBESEN.,What from thee may we expect?
86,NIELS EBBESEN.,
87,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“I have kindred in the North,"
88,NIELS EBBESEN.,Men of wealth and noble race;
89,NIELS EBBESEN.,Shouldst thou it require of them
90,NIELS EBBESEN.,They’ll be ready for thy Grace.”
91,NIELS EBBESEN.,
92,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Wise art thou, Niels Ebbesen,"
93,NIELS EBBESEN.,And thy prudence none can doubt;
94,NIELS EBBESEN.,When thou canst not straightway hit
95,NIELS EBBESEN.,Widely then thou ridst about.
96,NIELS EBBESEN.,
97,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Hear thou, Sir Niels Ebbesen,"
98,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thou must on mine errand ride;
99,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Say, how many men thou hast"
100,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Brought, on whom thou mayst confide?”"
101,NIELS EBBESEN.,
102,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Kindred, Sir, I have, and friends,"
103,NIELS EBBESEN.,’Mongst the hardy Jutlanders;
104,NIELS EBBESEN.,Willingly they follow me
105,NIELS EBBESEN.,To the stormy strife of spears.
106,NIELS EBBESEN.,
107,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“I have brought, such as they are,"
108,NIELS EBBESEN.,With me thirty mounted men;
109,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Be they fewer, or be they more,"
110,NIELS EBBESEN.,Dear are they to Ebbesen.”
111,NIELS EBBESEN.,
112,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Hast thou with thee thirty lads?
113,NIELS EBBESEN.,That seems but a scanty force;
114,NIELS EBBESEN.,Yester e’en at Sir Bugge’s Gate
115,NIELS EBBESEN.,Stood’st thou with a hundred horse.”
116,NIELS EBBESEN.,
117,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Backward Ebbesen recoiled,"
118,NIELS EBBESEN.,And with high flushed cheek replied:
119,NIELS EBBESEN.,“He nor knight nor gentleman
120,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Is, who me hath thus belied."
121,NIELS EBBESEN.,
122,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Be it man or woman who
123,NIELS EBBESEN.,"To my face dares that to say,"
124,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Till I’ve answered suitably,"
125,NIELS EBBESEN.,Ne’er from him I’ll flinch away.”
126,NIELS EBBESEN.,
127,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Hear thou, dear Niels Ebbesen,"
128,NIELS EBBESEN.,We thereof will talk no more;
129,NIELS EBBESEN.,"To thy friend Sir Bugge ride,"
130,NIELS EBBESEN.,Him to serve me true win o’er.”
131,NIELS EBBESEN.,
132,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“If your errand I shall do,"
133,NIELS EBBESEN.,"And to Bugge bold repair,"
134,NIELS EBBESEN.,From thy part what I’m to say
135,NIELS EBBESEN.,First to me thou must declare.”
136,NIELS EBBESEN.,
137,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Bugge bold has me defied,"
138,NIELS EBBESEN.,Young Poul Glob has done the same;
139,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Anders Frost makes one of them,"
140,NIELS EBBESEN.,Him your Chief ’tis said ye name.
141,NIELS EBBESEN.,
142,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“And e’en thou, Niels Ebbesen,"
143,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Certain courtiers hast with thee,"
144,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Who have eaten of my bread,"
145,NIELS EBBESEN.,And have basely quitted me.
146,NIELS EBBESEN.,
147,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“First there is young Eske Frost,"
148,NIELS EBBESEN.,And his stalwart brothers two;
149,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Without leave of mine obtained,"
150,NIELS EBBESEN.,From my service they withdrew.
151,NIELS EBBESEN.,
152,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“More there are whom I’ve obliged,"
153,NIELS EBBESEN.,And who pay me now no heed;
154,NIELS EBBESEN.,If to Bugge’s rede you list
155,NIELS EBBESEN.,Soon ye’ll see how you will speed.”
156,NIELS EBBESEN.,
157,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Nought of Bugge’s rede I know,"
158,NIELS EBBESEN.,What he’ll do or leave undone;
159,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Eske thy true servant was,"
160,NIELS EBBESEN.,Cast no blame that knight upon.
161,NIELS EBBESEN.,
162,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Eske Frost’s a gallant man,"
163,NIELS EBBESEN.,Guards his honour like his eye;
164,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Sought he his discharge to gain,"
165,NIELS EBBESEN.,Why to him didst it deny?
166,NIELS EBBESEN.,
167,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Custom ’tis in Danish land,"
168,NIELS EBBESEN.,"And has been from days of eld,"
169,NIELS EBBESEN.,That the man who will not serve
170,NIELS EBBESEN.,Shall not be to serve compell’d.
171,NIELS EBBESEN.,
172,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“No two things, save Monk and cowl,"
173,NIELS EBBESEN.,Are for aye together tied;
174,NIELS EBBESEN.,As they loathe or like their place
175,NIELS EBBESEN.,Courtmen ride away or bide.”
176,NIELS EBBESEN.,
177,NIELS EBBESEN.,"It was Count Sir Gert, could not"
178,NIELS EBBESEN.,Such like reasoning understand:
179,NIELS EBBESEN.,“No one ought to quit his lord
180,NIELS EBBESEN.,Whilst that lord would him command.
181,NIELS EBBESEN.,
182,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“And, Sir Niels, too long thou hast"
183,NIELS EBBESEN.,Here stood idly chattering;
184,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Either thou shalt Denmark quit,"
185,NIELS EBBESEN.,Or thou shalt on gallows swing.
186,NIELS EBBESEN.,
187,NIELS EBBESEN.,“’Neath safe convoy since thou’rt come
188,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thou shalt go withouten hurt;
189,NIELS EBBESEN.,To thy cost else thou should’st learn
190,NIELS EBBESEN.,What it is to anger Gert.”
191,NIELS EBBESEN.,
192,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“I thy princely passport hold,"
193,NIELS EBBESEN.,Whether it avail or not;
194,NIELS EBBESEN.,"If thou do me aught of harm,"
195,NIELS EBBESEN.,Infamy thy name will blot.
196,NIELS EBBESEN.,
197,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Thieves mayst thou on gallows hang,"
198,NIELS EBBESEN.,To be torn by carn and crow;
199,NIELS EBBESEN.,"For thy threat from native land,"
200,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Wife, and child, I will not go."
201,NIELS EBBESEN.,
202,NIELS EBBESEN.,“But if me from native land
203,NIELS EBBESEN.,"And my wife and babes you chase,"
204,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Thou shalt soon, for certainty,"
205,NIELS EBBESEN.,Rue thou e’er hast seen my face!”
206,NIELS EBBESEN.,
207,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Ride away, Sir Ebbesen,"
208,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Quickly hence thyself betake,"
209,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Or I will, as well I can,"
210,NIELS EBBESEN.,On thy skull the helmet break.”
211,NIELS EBBESEN.,
212,NIELS EBBESEN.,“None e’er saw me so adread
213,NIELS EBBESEN.,"But that I could tremble still, {12}"
214,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Hear, Count Gert! look to thyself,"
215,NIELS EBBESEN.,Guard thee from approaching ill.”
216,NIELS EBBESEN.,
217,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Ebbesen, thou tirest me,"
218,NIELS EBBESEN.,Suffering thus thy tongue to run;
219,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Till to-morrow thou art safe,"
220,NIELS EBBESEN.,Even till the set of sun.
221,NIELS EBBESEN.,
222,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“This, and the next day till eve,"
223,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thou for me shalt be at rest;
224,NIELS EBBESEN.,But no belted knight am I
225,NIELS EBBESEN.,If I be not soon thy guest.”
226,NIELS EBBESEN.,
227,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Swift away rode Ebbesen,"
228,NIELS EBBESEN.,Shook his iron-gloved fist in air:
229,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“That I soon shall come again,"
230,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Good Sir Count, in memory bear.”"
231,NIELS EBBESEN.,
232,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Forward rode Niels Ebbesen,"
233,NIELS EBBESEN.,Spurred his steed till blood outflew;
234,NIELS EBBESEN.,"With his men the Count remained,"
235,NIELS EBBESEN.,No one dared the knight pursue.
236,NIELS EBBESEN.,
237,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Till he reached his Castellaye,"
238,NIELS EBBESEN.,Still he rode withouten rest;
239,NIELS EBBESEN.,"To his dear Dame he complained,"
240,NIELS EBBESEN.,Begged of her her counsel best.
241,NIELS EBBESEN.,
242,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Here thou sitt’st, dear Housewife mine,"
243,NIELS EBBESEN.,What advice canst thou bestow?
244,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Gert will drive me from the land,"
245,NIELS EBBESEN.,Hath declared himself my foe.
246,NIELS EBBESEN.,
247,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“To my choice three things he put,"
248,NIELS EBBESEN.,Least of all I liked the third;
249,NIELS EBBESEN.,"I should join him, or the land"
250,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Quit, or hang, such was his word.”"
251,NIELS EBBESEN.,
252,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Ah! what counsel can I give
253,NIELS EBBESEN.,From my simple woman’s mind?
254,NIELS EBBESEN.,"The most desperate counsel’s best,"
255,NIELS EBBESEN.,Can we but that counsel find.
256,NIELS EBBESEN.,
257,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“The most desperate counsel’s best,"
258,NIELS EBBESEN.,If we can but it discover;
259,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Either slay the tyrant, or"
260,NIELS EBBESEN.,Burn the house the tyrant over.
261,NIELS EBBESEN.,
262,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“To the smithy lead your steeds,"
263,NIELS EBBESEN.,Let them all be shod anew;
264,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Turn ye all the heels afore,"
265,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thus your trace will cheat the view.
266,NIELS EBBESEN.,
267,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Turn ye all the heels afore,"
268,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Track ye thus, I ween, can no man;"
269,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Never tell to mortal wight,"
270,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thou hast learnt this from a woman.”
271,NIELS EBBESEN.,
272,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Here my gallant swains ye sit,"
273,NIELS EBBESEN.,Merry-making o’er your drink;
274,NIELS EBBESEN.,Every lad who loves his lord
275,NIELS EBBESEN.,From his lord now must not shrink.”
276,NIELS EBBESEN.,
277,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Up then rose the Courtmen bold,"
278,NIELS EBBESEN.,To take on anew agreed;
279,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Save Sir Niels’ sister’s son,"
280,NIELS EBBESEN.,From his uncle would recede.
281,NIELS EBBESEN.,
282,NIELS EBBESEN.,Swore the knights a solemn oath
283,NIELS EBBESEN.,"That for him their lives they’d stake,"
284,NIELS EBBESEN.,And with him would dauntless ride
285,NIELS EBBESEN.,Wheresoe’er a fray he’d make.
286,NIELS EBBESEN.,
287,NIELS EBBESEN.,"So they rode to Fruerlund,"
288,NIELS EBBESEN.,From their steeds they there dismount;
289,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Into Randers then they walked,"
290,NIELS EBBESEN.,To beat up the hairless Count.
291,NIELS EBBESEN.,
292,NIELS EBBESEN.,"It was Sir Niels Ebbesen,"
293,NIELS EBBESEN.,To the bridge of Randers came:
294,NIELS EBBESEN.,“He who’s loath to follow me
295,NIELS EBBESEN.,Straightway his discharge may claim.”
296,NIELS EBBESEN.,
297,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Forward stepped the tiny Frost,"
298,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thought the truest of the true:
299,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Give me my dismissal, Sir,"
300,NIELS EBBESEN.,Give me horse and saddle too.”
301,NIELS EBBESEN.,
302,NIELS EBBESEN.,"So he sought and got discharge,"
303,NIELS EBBESEN.,Saddle got and steed withall;
304,NIELS EBBESEN.,But he served his master best
305,NIELS EBBESEN.,That same day ere evening fall.
306,NIELS EBBESEN.,
307,NIELS EBBESEN.,"To the Count’s door rode Sir Niels,"
308,NIELS EBBESEN.,Ne’er from that withdrew his look;
309,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thrice thereon with iron lance
310,NIELS EBBESEN.,Heavily the hero strook.
311,NIELS EBBESEN.,
312,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Rise up from thy sleep, my lord!"
313,NIELS EBBESEN.,Let me in right speedily;
314,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Thy dear brother, Henrik Count,"
315,NIELS EBBESEN.,Has dispatched me unto thee.”
316,NIELS EBBESEN.,
317,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“By my brother if thou’rt sent,"
318,NIELS EBBESEN.,Rest thee from thy journey long;
319,NIELS EBBESEN.,Me to-morrow in the Kirk
320,NIELS EBBESEN.,Meet ’twixt mass and matin song.”
321,NIELS EBBESEN.,
322,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Let your page but at the door
323,NIELS EBBESEN.,Take from me the entrusted scroll;
324,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Ribe hard invested is,"
325,NIELS EBBESEN.,Colding town is burnt to coal.
326,NIELS EBBESEN.,
327,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Ribe hard invested is,"
328,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Colding’s burnt, and Vedel’s flung"
329,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Open to our troops its gate,"
330,NIELS EBBESEN.,And Niels Ebbesen is hung.”
331,NIELS EBBESEN.,
332,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“If what thou hast told be truth,"
333,NIELS EBBESEN.,News it is to make one gay;
334,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thou shalt in respect be held
335,NIELS EBBESEN.,Herald till thy dying day.
336,NIELS EBBESEN.,
337,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Page! no more keep fast the door,"
338,NIELS EBBESEN.,Let me on the herald gaze;
339,NIELS EBBESEN.,For that we the land have won
340,NIELS EBBESEN.,Is the sum of what he says.”
341,NIELS EBBESEN.,
342,NIELS EBBESEN.,"To the window went the Count,"
343,NIELS EBBESEN.,Thence his eye the lances caught:
344,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Ha! Niels Ebbesen’s at hand,"
345,NIELS EBBESEN.,Curse the hour I Denmark sought.”
346,NIELS EBBESEN.,
347,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Fierce with shields the doors they banged,"
348,NIELS EBBESEN.,Burst the locks with frequent blow:
349,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Hairless Count! art thou within?
350,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Hairless Count, we pledge thee now!”"
351,NIELS EBBESEN.,
352,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Set thee down, Niels Ebbesen,"
353,NIELS EBBESEN.,We shall things accommodate;
354,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Let us send to Henrik Count,"
355,NIELS EBBESEN.,And Claus Krummedige straight.”
356,NIELS EBBESEN.,
357,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Not so yesterday didst thou
358,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Speak, Sir Count, by Randers strand;"
359,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Then thou saidst that I should hang,"
360,NIELS EBBESEN.,Or should quit my native land.”
361,NIELS EBBESEN.,
362,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Up and spoke the Count’s footpage,"
363,NIELS EBBESEN.,Kinsman he to Ebbesen:
364,NIELS EBBESEN.,“By his words if ye be fooled
365,NIELS EBBESEN.,Lost art thou and all thy men.”
366,NIELS EBBESEN.,
367,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Up and spoke the black young page,"
368,NIELS EBBESEN.,Black because he was not white:
369,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Straight desist from useless talk,"
370,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Let, I rede, your faulchions bite.”"
371,NIELS EBBESEN.,
372,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“I’ve no castles, Sir, which can"
373,NIELS EBBESEN.,Such a prisoner long contain;
374,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Now, ye men, spare not your swords!"
375,NIELS EBBESEN.,Hew at him with might and main!”
376,NIELS EBBESEN.,
377,NIELS EBBESEN.,"So the tyrant Count they took,"
378,NIELS EBBESEN.,Made him kneel upon the floor;
379,NIELS EBBESEN.,"And his bald head off they hewed,"
380,NIELS EBBESEN.,Hewed it off the bedstead o’er.
381,NIELS EBBESEN.,
382,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Soon as they the Count had slain,"
383,NIELS EBBESEN.,Loud the drums the alarum beat;
384,NIELS EBBESEN.,It was Sir Niels Ebbesen
385,NIELS EBBESEN.,From the town would fain retreat.
386,NIELS EBBESEN.,
387,NIELS EBBESEN.,"From the town he hasted then,"
388,NIELS EBBESEN.,Dared no longer there to stay;
389,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Soon met him Sir Ove Hals,"
390,NIELS EBBESEN.,And essayed to bar his way.
391,NIELS EBBESEN.,
392,NIELS EBBESEN.,"“Do thou hear, Sir Ove Hals!"
393,NIELS EBBESEN.,Do to me no injury!
394,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Thou my faithful cousin art,"
395,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Prythee, Ove, let me flee.”"
396,NIELS EBBESEN.,
397,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Our affinity I know
398,NIELS EBBESEN.,Well I know its near degree;
399,NIELS EBBESEN.,"But my Lord you’ve foully slain,"
400,NIELS EBBESEN.,Niels! I will not let thee flee.”
401,NIELS EBBESEN.,
402,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Bleat the sheep, the ganders hiss,"
403,NIELS EBBESEN.,Crows the cock upon the wall;
404,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Ove Hals was sore beset,"
405,NIELS EBBESEN.,Must to the Holsteiners call.
406,NIELS EBBESEN.,
407,NIELS EBBESEN.,"’Gainst the Danes he could not stand,"
408,NIELS EBBESEN.,Must to the Holsteiners call;
409,NIELS EBBESEN.,“Murdered is your liege the Count
410,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Up, and on his butchers fall!”"
411,NIELS EBBESEN.,
412,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Fight Sir Ove and Sir Niels,"
413,NIELS EBBESEN.,"Ebbesen he would not fly,"

451,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
452,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
453,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Our King and Queen sat o’er the board
454,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,In high festivity;
455,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Between them there was much discourse
456,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,About the briny sea.
457,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
458,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Our gallant King and youthful Queen
459,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,They sailed across the foam;
460,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Much better had it been for both
461,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,That they had stayed at home.
462,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
463,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,But barely they a mile had gone
464,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"When still the vessel stood,"
465,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"There came a raven wild, who strove,"
466,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To sink them in the flood.
467,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
468,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“If any thing the ship doth hold
469,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Concealed beneath the main,"
470,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"I’ll give thee, bird, a lump of gold"
471,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To set it free again.
472,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
473,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“O do not sink us in the sea,"
474,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Swart bird,” exclaimed the Queen,"
475,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“And I’ll give thee a lump of gold
476,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Weighs Bismer pounds fifteen.”
477,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
478,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Gold and silver I heed them not,"
479,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"I crave another fee,"
480,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,The treasure neath thy girdle fair
481,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Thou now must promise me.
482,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
483,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Plenty of gold I have myself,"
484,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"From gold no help you’ll find,"
485,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,On what beneath your girdle’s hid
486,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I’ve firmly set my mind.”
487,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
488,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“I give what neath my girdle’s hid,"
489,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,My bunch of keys—what more?
490,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I’ll speedily have others forged
491,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,If I but win to shore.”
492,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
493,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Then straight she took the little keys
494,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And cast them overboard;
495,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Away then flew the Raven, glad"
496,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,He had obtained her word.
497,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
498,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"The Queen walks on the yellow sand,"
499,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Then o’er her came a gloom,"
500,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,She felt that Germand Gladenswayne
501,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Was quick within her womb.
502,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
503,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And from that day when five short months
504,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Her head had flitted o’er,"
505,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"The Queen she went to the chamber high,"
506,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And a lovely son she bore.
507,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
508,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Born was he in the evening hour,"
509,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,They christened him at night;
510,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"They called him Germand Gladenswayne,"
511,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Concealed him whilst they might.
512,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
513,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"They fostered him a winter’s space,"
514,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,They fostered him for nine;
515,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,The fairest youth he grew on whom
516,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,The sun did ever shine.
517,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
518,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"So well he throve, so well he grew,"
519,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"His horse he well could ride,"
520,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Whene’er his mother on him gazed
521,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,So woefully she sigh’d.
522,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
523,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Now list to me, my mother dear,"
524,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,One thing I fain would know;
525,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Why dost thou sigh so piteously
526,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Whene’er I past thee go?”
527,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
528,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Now hear thou, Germand Gladenswayne,"
529,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I’ve cause to be forlorn;
530,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Beguiled I gave thee to a fiend
531,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Before thou yet wast born.”
532,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
533,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“And do thou hear, my mother dear,"
534,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,All sorrow cast aside:
535,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Whatever be the will of God
536,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,By that I must abide.”
537,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
538,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,It chanced upon a harvest morn
539,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"The breezes scarcely stirr’d,"
540,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,That as the chamber door stood ope
541,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,So wild a yell was heard.
542,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
543,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"In came the laidly bird of prey,"
544,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And stood the Queen before:
545,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Dost thou remember, gracious Queen,"
546,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Thy gift to me of yore?”
547,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
548,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She swore by God, and by the saints,"
549,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"By all that’s good she swore,"
550,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,That son nor daughter in the world
551,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She never, never bore."
552,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
553,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Then flew away the bird of prey,"
554,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,With an eldritch shriek he’s flown:
555,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“Whene’er I meet Germand Gladenswayne
556,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I’ll remember he’s my own.”
557,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
558,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,When Germand fifteen years had reached
559,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,He’d fain a damsel wed;
560,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"He loved the daughter of England’s king,"
561,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,The angel-lovely maid.
562,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
563,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,His longing to be with his plighted maid
564,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,He might no more withstand:
565,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“O how shall I come across the foam
566,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To the flood-encircled land?”
567,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
568,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"It was Germand Gladenswayne,"
569,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,He donned his best array;
570,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And he has ta’en to his mother dear
571,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To the lofty hall his way.
572,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
573,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"In came Germand Gladenswayne,"
574,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,In scarlet clad was he:
575,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“O mother lend me thy feather robe
576,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To fly across the sea.”
577,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
578,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“My feather robe hangs upon the crook,"
579,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"The feathers droop so low,"
580,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,If thou dost fly to the foreign land
581,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I shall see thee never moe.
582,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
583,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“The pinions are so broad that they
584,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Grow heavy in the air,"
585,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I’ll have another made for me
586,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,If I live another year.”
587,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
588,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"He set himself in the feather robe,"
589,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Flew o’er the ocean straight;
590,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"And there met him the raven wild,"
591,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Beneath a rock did wait.
592,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
593,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"He flew up, and he flew down,"
594,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,He flew in fearless guise;
595,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And when he reached the midst of the sea
596,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,He heard a frightful voice.
597,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
598,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Ha, well met, Germand Gladenswayne,"
599,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,O’er long hast thou delay’d;
600,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Thou wast but little when to me
601,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,A present thou wast made!”
602,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
603,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“O let me fare, O let me fly,"
604,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To speak my maiden dear;
605,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Be sure that I, when her I’ve seen,"
606,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Again will meet thee here.”
607,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
608,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Then I will let thee fly, but still"
609,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"My mark on thee will set,"
610,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Lest thou midst knights and beauteous dames
611,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Thy raven lord forget.”
612,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
613,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Then out the boy’s right eye he tore,"
614,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And drank up half his blood;
615,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"But still he reached the bower of his bride,"
616,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,His heart was yet so good.
617,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
618,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"He set himself by the Damsels’ bower,"
619,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,All bloody and distrest;
620,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,All the dames within that were
621,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Forgot to smile and jest.
622,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
623,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"All the damsels grew so still,"
624,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,With horror sat they fast;
625,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Except proud Damsel Adelude,"
626,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Aside her work she cast.
627,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
628,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,All the maids within forsook
629,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Both jest and merry note;
630,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,’Twas the proud Damsel Adelude
631,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Her hands together smote.
632,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
633,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Now welcome, Germand Gladenswayne,"
634,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Where hast thou been to play?
635,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Say, why bebloodied are thy clothes,"
636,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And pale thy cheeks as clay?”
637,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
638,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Farewell, dear Damsel Adelude,"
639,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,I soon from thee must fly;
640,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,For he must have my youthful life
641,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Who tore from me my eye.”
642,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
643,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Her silver handled comb she took,"
644,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And strove to comb his head;
645,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,For every hair that she did comb
646,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,A briny tear she shed.
647,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
648,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,For every lock the maiden combed
649,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,A stream of tears did run;
650,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,How often she the mother cursed
651,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Who had betrayed her son.
652,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
653,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"It was Damsel Adelude,"
654,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,She took him in her arm:
655,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,“Accursed be the wicked Dame
656,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Who caused us all this harm.”
657,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
658,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Hear thou, sweet Damsel Adelude,"
659,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Curse not my mother so,"
660,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She had no power in this affair,"
661,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,We all to fate must bow.”
662,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
663,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"He set him in his feather robe,"
664,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And mounted on the wind;
665,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She set her in another robe,"
666,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And followed fast behind.
667,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
668,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“O turn thee, Damsel Adelude,"
669,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Turn my beloved one,"
670,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Thy bower door doth open stand,"
671,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Thy keys lie on the stone.”
672,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
673,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"“Though my bower door doth open stand,"
674,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"And my keys lie on the stone,"
675,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Yet I will follow thee to the place
676,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Where harm to thee was done.”
677,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
678,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,All the birds she cut so small
679,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She met with there on high,"
680,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"Except the laidly Raven wild,"
681,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And him she could not spy.
682,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
683,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,’Twas the proud Damsel Adelude
684,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Flew down towards the strand;
685,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Nought found she of the Gladenswayne
686,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Except the good right hand.
687,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
688,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,She flew so wroth the clouds below
689,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,The laidly bird to find;
690,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She flew East, and she flew West,"
691,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,To slay him she designed.
692,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
693,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,"She hacked the birds into pieces three,"
694,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Before her knife that came;
695,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,But when she met the Raven wild
696,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,Into ten she hacked his frame.
697,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,
698,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,And still till she of sorrow died
699,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,She flew across the heath;
700,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,It was for Germand Gladenswayne
701,GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE,She suffered grief and death.
