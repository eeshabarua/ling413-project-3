55,PREFACE,
56,PREFACE,
57,PREFACE,For this Anthology I have tried to range over the whole field of English
58,PREFACE,"Verse from the beginning, or from the Thirteenth Century to this closing"
59,PREFACE,"year of the Nineteenth, and to choose the best. Nor have I sought in"
60,PREFACE,"these Islands only, but wheresoever the Muse has followed the tongue"
61,PREFACE,which among living tongues she most delights to honour. To bring home
62,PREFACE,and render so great a spoil compendiously has been my capital
63,PREFACE,difficulty. It is for the reader to judge if I have so managed it as to
64,PREFACE,serve those who already love poetry and to implant that love in some
65,PREFACE,young minds not yet initiated.
66,PREFACE,
67,PREFACE,My scheme is simple. I have arranged the poets as nearly as possible in
68,PREFACE,"order of birth, with such groupings of anonymous pieces as seemed"
69,PREFACE,"convenient. For convenience, too, as well as to avoid a dispute-royal, I"
70,PREFACE,have gathered the most of the Ballads into the middle of the Seventeenth
71,PREFACE,Century; where they fill a languid interval between two winds of
72,PREFACE,inspiration--the Italian dying down with Milton and the French following
73,PREFACE,"at the heels of the restored Royalists. For convenience, again, I have"
74,PREFACE,set myself certain rules of spelling. In the very earliest poems
75,PREFACE,"inflection and spelling are structural, and to modernize is to destroy."
76,PREFACE,But as old inflections fade into modern the old spelling becomes less
77,PREFACE,"and less vital, and has been brought (not, I hope, too abruptly) into"
78,PREFACE,line with that sanctioned by use and familiar. To do this seemed wiser
79,PREFACE,than to discourage many readers for the sake of diverting others by a
80,PREFACE,scent of antiquity which--to be essential--should breathe of something
81,PREFACE,rarer than an odd arrangement of type. But there are scholars whom I
82,PREFACE,cannot expect to agree with me; and to conciliate them I have excepted
83,PREFACE,Spenser and Milton from the rule.
84,PREFACE,
85,PREFACE,Glosses of archaic and otherwise difficult words are given at the foot
86,PREFACE,of the page: but the text has not been disfigured with reference-marks.
87,PREFACE,And rather than make the book unwieldy I have eschewed
88,PREFACE,notes--reluctantly when some obscure passage or allusion seemed to ask
89,PREFACE,for a timely word; with more equanimity when the temptation was to
90,PREFACE,criticize or ‘appreciate.’ For the function of the anthologist includes
91,PREFACE,criticizing in silence.
92,PREFACE,
93,PREFACE,Care has been taken with the texts. But I have sometimes thought it
94,PREFACE,consistent with the aim of the book to prefer the more beautiful to the
95,PREFACE,better attested reading. I have often excised weak or superfluous
96,PREFACE,stanzas when sure that excision would improve; and have not hesitated to
97,PREFACE,extract a few stanzas from a long poem when persuaded that they could
98,PREFACE,stand alone as a lyric. The apology for such experiments can only lie in
99,PREFACE,"their success: but the risk is one which, in my judgement, the"
100,PREFACE,"anthologist ought to take. A few small corrections have been made, but"
101,PREFACE,only when they were quite obvious.
102,PREFACE,
103,PREFACE,The numbers chosen are either lyrical or epigrammatic. Indeed I am
104,PREFACE,mistaken if a single epigram included fails to preserve at least some
105,PREFACE,faint thrill of the emotion through which it had to pass before the
106,PREFACE,"Muse’s lips let it fall, with however exquisite deliberation. But the"
107,PREFACE,lyrical spirit is volatile and notoriously hard to bind with
108,PREFACE,definitions; and seems to grow wilder with the years. With the
109,PREFACE,anthologist--as with the fisherman who knows the fish at the end of his
110,PREFACE,"sea-line--the gift, if he have it, comes by sense, improved by practice."
111,PREFACE,"The definition, if he be clever enough to frame one, comes by"
112,PREFACE,"after-thought. I don’t know that it helps, and am sure that it may"
113,PREFACE,easily mislead.
114,PREFACE,
115,PREFACE,"Having set my heart on choosing the best, I resolved not to be dissuaded"
116,PREFACE,by common objections against anthologies--that they repeat one another
117,PREFACE,until the proverb δὶς ἢ τρὶς τὰ καλά loses all application--or perturbed
118,PREFACE,if my judgement should often agree with that of good critics. The best
119,PREFACE,"is the best, though a hundred judges have declared it so; nor had it"
120,PREFACE,been any feat to search out and insert the second-rate merely because it
121,PREFACE,"happened to be recondite. To be sure, a man must come to such a task as"
122,PREFACE,mine haunted by his youth and the favourites he loved in days when he
123,PREFACE,had much enthusiasm but little reading.
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,A deeper import
126,PREFACE,Lurks in the legend told my infant years
127,PREFACE,Than lies upon that truth we live to learn.
128,PREFACE,
129,PREFACE,Few of my contemporaries can erase--or would wish to erase--the dye
130,PREFACE,their minds took from the late Mr. Palgrave’s _Golden Treasury_: and he
131,PREFACE,who has returned to it again and again with an affection born of
132,PREFACE,companionship on many journeys must remember not only what the _Golden
133,PREFACE,"Treasury_ includes, but the moment when this or that poem appealed to"
134,PREFACE,"him, and even how it lies on the page. To Mr. Bullen’s _Lyrics from the"
135,PREFACE,Elizabethan Song Books_ and his other treasuries I own a more advised
136,PREFACE,debt. Nor am I free of obligation to anthologies even more recent--to
137,PREFACE,"Archbishop Trench’s _Household Book of Poetry_, Mr. Locker-Lampson’s"
138,PREFACE,"_Lyra Elegantiarum_, Mr. Miles’ _Poets and Poetry of the Century_, Mr."
139,PREFACE,"Beeching’s _Paradise of English Poetry_, Mr. Henley’s _English Lyrics_,"
140,PREFACE,"Mrs. Sharp’s _Lyra Celtica_, Mr. Yeats’ _Book of Irish Verse_, and Mr."
141,PREFACE,Churton Collins’ _Treasury of Minor British Poetry_: though my rule has
142,PREFACE,been to consult these after making my own choice. Yet I can claim that
143,PREFACE,the help derived from them--though gratefully owned--bears but a
144,PREFACE,"trifling proportion to the labour, special and desultory, which has gone"
145,PREFACE,to the making of my book.
146,PREFACE,
147,PREFACE,For the anthologist’s is not quite the _dilettante_ business for which
148,PREFACE,"it is too often and ignorantly derided. I say this, and immediately"
149,PREFACE,repent; since my wish is that the reader should in his own pleasure
150,PREFACE,"quite forget the editor’s labour, which too has been pleasant: that,"
151,PREFACE,"standing aside, I may believe this book has made the Muses’ access"
152,PREFACE,"easier when, in the right hour, they come to him to uplift or to"
153,PREFACE,console--

197,PREFACE,"which, however, must not conclude without a word of special thanks to"
198,PREFACE,Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll for many suggestions and some pains kindly

9063,BEN JONSON,"He leap’d the present age,"

9079,BEN JONSON,And keep the one half from his _Harry_.
9080,BEN JONSON,"But fate doth so alternate the design,"
9081,BEN JONSON,"Whilst that in Heav’n, this light on earth must shine."
9082,BEN JONSON,
9083,BEN JONSON,And shine as you exalted are!
9084,BEN JONSON,"Two names of friendship, but one star:"
9085,BEN JONSON,Of hearts the union: and those not by chance
9086,BEN JONSON,"Made, or indenture, or leased out to advance"
9087,BEN JONSON,The profits for a time.
9088,BEN JONSON,No pleasures vain did chime
9089,BEN JONSON,"Of rimes or riots at your feasts,"
9090,BEN JONSON,Orgies of drink or feign’d protests;
9091,BEN JONSON,"But simple love of greatness and of good,"
9092,BEN JONSON,That knits brave minds and manners more than blood.
9093,BEN JONSON,
9094,BEN JONSON,This made you first to know the _Why_
9095,BEN JONSON,"_You liked_, then after, to apply"
9096,BEN JONSON,"That liking, and approach so one the t’other"
9097,BEN JONSON,Till either grew a portion of the other:
9098,BEN JONSON,Each stylèd by his end
9099,BEN JONSON,The copy of his friend.
9100,BEN JONSON,You lived to be the great surnames
9101,BEN JONSON,And titles by which all made claims
9102,BEN JONSON,Unto the Virtue--nothing perfect done
9103,BEN JONSON,But as a _CARY_ or a _MORISON_.
9104,BEN JONSON,
9105,BEN JONSON,And such the force the fair example had
9106,BEN JONSON,As they that saw
9107,BEN JONSON,"The good, and durst not practise it, were glad"
9108,BEN JONSON,That such a law
9109,BEN JONSON,"Was left yet to mankind,"
9110,BEN JONSON,Where they might read and find
9111,BEN JONSON,"Friendship indeed was written, not in words,"
9112,BEN JONSON,"And with the heart, not pen,"
9113,BEN JONSON,"Of two so early men,"
9114,BEN JONSON,Whose lines her rules were and records:

9237,JOHN DONNE,Therefore thou waked’st me wisely; yet
9238,JOHN DONNE,"My dream thou brok’st not, but continued’st it."
9239,JOHN DONNE,Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice
9240,JOHN DONNE,To make dreams truths and fables histories;
9241,JOHN DONNE,"Enter these arms, for since thou thought’st it best"
9242,JOHN DONNE,"Not to dream all my dream, let’s act the rest."

9244,JOHN DONNE,"As lightning, or a taper’s light,"

9255,JOHN DONNE,"Coming and staying show’d thee thee,"

9281,JOHN DONNE,"Those hairs, which upward grew, and strength and art"

9286,JOHN DONNE,

9291,JOHN DONNE,As ’twas humility

12288,EDMUND WALLER,The seas are quiet when the winds give o’er;
12289,EDMUND WALLER,So calm are we when passions are no more.
12290,EDMUND WALLER,For then we know how vain it was to boast
12291,EDMUND WALLER,"Of fleeting things, so certain to be lost."
12292,EDMUND WALLER,Clouds of affection from our younger eyes
12293,EDMUND WALLER,Conceal that emptiness which age descries.
12294,EDMUND WALLER,
12295,EDMUND WALLER,"The soul’s dark cottage, batter’d and decay’d,"

12297,EDMUND WALLER,"Stronger by weakness, wiser men become"
12298,EDMUND WALLER,As they draw near to their eternal home.

12312,JOHN MILTON,"While the Heav’n-born-childe,"
12313,JOHN MILTON,All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;
12314,JOHN MILTON,Nature in aw to him
12315,JOHN MILTON,"Had doff’t her gawdy trim,"
12316,JOHN MILTON,With her great Master so to sympathize:
12317,JOHN MILTON,It was no season then for her
12318,JOHN MILTON,To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour.
12319,JOHN MILTON,
12320,JOHN MILTON,
12321,JOHN MILTON,Only with speeches fair
12322,JOHN MILTON,She woo’s the gentle Air
12323,JOHN MILTON,"To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow,"
12324,JOHN MILTON,"And on her naked shame,"
12325,JOHN MILTON,"Pollute with sinfull blame,"
12326,JOHN MILTON,"The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw,"
12327,JOHN MILTON,"Confounded, that her Makers eyes"
12328,JOHN MILTON,Should look so neer upon her foul deformities.
12329,JOHN MILTON,
12330,JOHN MILTON,"But he her fears to cease,"
12331,JOHN MILTON,"Sent down the meek-eyd Peace,"
12332,JOHN MILTON,"She crown’d with Olive green, came softly sliding"
12333,JOHN MILTON,Down through the turning sphear
12334,JOHN MILTON,"His ready Harbinger,"
12335,JOHN MILTON,"With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,"
12336,JOHN MILTON,"And waving wide her mirtle wand,"
12337,JOHN MILTON,She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land.
12338,JOHN MILTON,
12339,JOHN MILTON,"No War, or Battails sound"
12340,JOHN MILTON,"Was heard the World around,"
12341,JOHN MILTON,The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
12342,JOHN MILTON,The hookèd Chariot stood
12343,JOHN MILTON,"Unstain’d with hostile blood,"
12344,JOHN MILTON,"The Trumpet spake not to the armèd throng,"
12345,JOHN MILTON,"And Kings sate still with awfull eye,"
12346,JOHN MILTON,As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.
12347,JOHN MILTON,
12348,JOHN MILTON,But peacefull was the night
12349,JOHN MILTON,Wherin the Prince of light
12350,JOHN MILTON,His raign of peace upon the earth began:
12351,JOHN MILTON,"The Windes with wonder whist,"
12352,JOHN MILTON,"Smoothly the waters kist,"
12353,JOHN MILTON,"Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean,"
12354,JOHN MILTON,"Who now hath quite forgot to rave,"
12355,JOHN MILTON,While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmèd wave.

12358,JOHN MILTON,The Stars with deep amaze
12359,JOHN MILTON,"Stand fixt in stedfast gaze,"
12360,JOHN MILTON,"Bending one way their pretious influence,"
12361,JOHN MILTON,"And will not take their flight,"
12362,JOHN MILTON,"For all the morning light,"
12363,JOHN MILTON,Or Lucifer that often warn’d them thence;
12364,JOHN MILTON,"But in their glimmering Orbs did glow,"
12365,JOHN MILTON,"Untill their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go."
12366,JOHN MILTON,
12367,JOHN MILTON,And though the shady gloom
12368,JOHN MILTON,"Had given day her room,"
12369,JOHN MILTON,"The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed,"
12370,JOHN MILTON,"And hid his head for shame,"
12371,JOHN MILTON,"As his inferiour flame,"
12372,JOHN MILTON,The new enlightn’d world no more should need;
12373,JOHN MILTON,He saw a greater Sun appear
12374,JOHN MILTON,"Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear."
12375,JOHN MILTON,
12376,JOHN MILTON,"The Shepherds on the Lawn,"

12379,JOHN MILTON,"Full little thought they than,"
12380,JOHN MILTON,That the mighty Pan
12381,JOHN MILTON,Was kindly com to live with them below;
12382,JOHN MILTON,"Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep,"
12383,JOHN MILTON,Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep.
12384,JOHN MILTON,
12385,JOHN MILTON,When such musick sweet
12386,JOHN MILTON,"Their hearts and ears did greet,"
12387,JOHN MILTON,"As never was by mortall finger strook,"
12388,JOHN MILTON,Divinely-warbled voice
12389,JOHN MILTON,"Answering the stringèd noise,"
12390,JOHN MILTON,As all their souls in blisfull rapture took
12391,JOHN MILTON,"The Air such pleasure loth to lose,"
12392,JOHN MILTON,With thousand echo’s still prolongs each heav’nly close.
12393,JOHN MILTON,
12394,JOHN MILTON,
12395,JOHN MILTON,Nature that heard such sound
12396,JOHN MILTON,Beneath the hollow round
12397,JOHN MILTON,"Of Cynthia’s seat, the Airy region thrilling,"
12398,JOHN MILTON,Now was almost won
12399,JOHN MILTON,"To think her part was don,"
12400,JOHN MILTON,And that her raign had here its last fulfilling;
12401,JOHN MILTON,She knew such harmony alone
12402,JOHN MILTON,Could hold all Heav’n and Earth in happier union.
12403,JOHN MILTON,
12404,JOHN MILTON,At last surrounds their sight
12405,JOHN MILTON,"A Globe of circular light,"
12406,JOHN MILTON,"That with long beams the shame-fac’t night array’d,"
12407,JOHN MILTON,The helmèd Cherubim
12408,JOHN MILTON,"And sworded Seraphim,"
12409,JOHN MILTON,"Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid,"
12410,JOHN MILTON,"Harping in loud and solemn quire,"
12411,JOHN MILTON,With unexpressive notes to Heav’ns new-born Heir.
12412,JOHN MILTON,
12413,JOHN MILTON,Such musick (as ’tis said)
12414,JOHN MILTON,"Before was never made,"
12415,JOHN MILTON,"But when of old the sons of morning sung,"
12416,JOHN MILTON,While the Creator Great
12417,JOHN MILTON,"His constellations set,"
12418,JOHN MILTON,"And the well-ballanc’t world on hinges hung,"
12419,JOHN MILTON,"And cast the dark foundations deep,"
12420,JOHN MILTON,And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep.
12421,JOHN MILTON,
12422,JOHN MILTON,"Ring out ye Crystall sphears,"
12423,JOHN MILTON,"Once bless our human ears,"
12424,JOHN MILTON,(If ye have power to touch our senses so)
12425,JOHN MILTON,And let your silver chime
12426,JOHN MILTON,Move in melodious time;
12427,JOHN MILTON,And let the Base of Heav’ns deep Organ blow
12428,JOHN MILTON,And with your ninefold harmony
12429,JOHN MILTON,Make up full consort to th’Angelike symphony.
12430,JOHN MILTON,
12431,JOHN MILTON,
12432,JOHN MILTON,For if such holy Song
12433,JOHN MILTON,"Enwrap our fancy long,"
12434,JOHN MILTON,"Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,"
12435,JOHN MILTON,And speckl’d vanity
12436,JOHN MILTON,"Will sicken soon and die,"
12437,JOHN MILTON,"And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould,"
12438,JOHN MILTON,"And Hell it self will pass away,"
12439,JOHN MILTON,And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.
12440,JOHN MILTON,
12441,JOHN MILTON,"Yea Truth, and Justice then"
12442,JOHN MILTON,"Will down return to men,"
12443,JOHN MILTON,"Th’enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing,"
12444,JOHN MILTON,"And Mercy set between,"
12445,JOHN MILTON,"Thron’d in Celestiall sheen,"
12446,JOHN MILTON,"With radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing,"
12447,JOHN MILTON,"And Heav’n as at som festivall,"
12448,JOHN MILTON,Will open wide the Gates of her high Palace Hall.
12449,JOHN MILTON,
12450,JOHN MILTON,"But wisest Fate sayes no,"
12451,JOHN MILTON,"This must not yet be so,"
12452,JOHN MILTON,"The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy,"
12453,JOHN MILTON,That on the bitter cross
12454,JOHN MILTON,Must redeem our loss;
12455,JOHN MILTON,So both himself and us to glorifie:
12456,JOHN MILTON,"Yet first to those ychain’d in sleep,"
12457,JOHN MILTON,"The wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep,"
12458,JOHN MILTON,
12459,JOHN MILTON,With such a horrid clang
12460,JOHN MILTON,As on mount Sinai rang
12461,JOHN MILTON,"While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake:"
12462,JOHN MILTON,The agèd Earth agast
12463,JOHN MILTON,"With terrour of that blast,"
12464,JOHN MILTON,Shall from the surface to the center shake;
12465,JOHN MILTON,"When at the worlds last session,"
12466,JOHN MILTON,The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne.
12467,JOHN MILTON,
12468,JOHN MILTON,
12469,JOHN MILTON,And then at last our bliss
12470,JOHN MILTON,"Full and perfect is,"
12471,JOHN MILTON,But now begins; for from this happy day
12472,JOHN MILTON,Th’old Dragon under ground
12473,JOHN MILTON,"In straiter limits bound,"
12474,JOHN MILTON,"Not half so far casts his usurpèd sway,"
12475,JOHN MILTON,"And wrath to see his Kingdom fail,"
12476,JOHN MILTON,Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail.
12477,JOHN MILTON,
12478,JOHN MILTON,"The Oracles are dumm,"
12479,JOHN MILTON,No voice or hideous humm
12480,JOHN MILTON,Runs through the archèd roof in words deceiving.
12481,JOHN MILTON,Apollo from his shrine
12482,JOHN MILTON,"Can no more divine,"
12483,JOHN MILTON,With hollow shreik the steep of Delphos leaving.
12484,JOHN MILTON,"No nightly trance, or breathèd spell,"
12485,JOHN MILTON,Inspire’s the pale-ey’d Priest from the prophetic cell.
12486,JOHN MILTON,
12487,JOHN MILTON,"The lonely mountains o’re,"
12488,JOHN MILTON,"And the resounding shore,"

12492,JOHN MILTON,"The parting Genius is with sighing sent,"
12493,JOHN MILTON,With flowre-inwov’n tresses torn
12494,JOHN MILTON,The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.
12495,JOHN MILTON,

12501,JOHN MILTON,Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint;
12502,JOHN MILTON,"And the chill Marble seems to sweat,"

13319,SABRINA,"With Nectar pure his oozy Lock’s he laves,"
13320,SABRINA,"And hears the unexpressive nuptiall Song,"

14602,ABRAHAM COWLEY,In this more than kingly state
14603,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Love himself on me shall wait.
14604,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Fill to me, Love! nay, fill it up!"
14605,ABRAHAM COWLEY,And mingled cast into the cup
14606,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Wit and mirth and noble fires,"
14607,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Vigorous health and gay desires.
14608,ABRAHAM COWLEY,The wheel of life no less will stay
14609,ABRAHAM COWLEY,In a smooth than rugged way:
14610,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Since it equally doth flee,"
14611,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Let the motion pleasant be.
14612,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Why do we precious ointments shower?--
14613,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Nobler wines why do we pour?--
14614,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Beauteous flowers why do we spread
14615,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Upon the monuments of the dead?
14616,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Nothing they but dust can show,"
14617,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Or bones that hasten to be so.
14618,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Crown me with roses while I live,"
14619,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Now your wines and ointments give:
14620,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"After death I nothing crave,"
14621,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Let me alive my pleasures have:
14622,ABRAHAM COWLEY,All are Stoics in the grave.

14626,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14627,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Foolish prater, what dost thou"
14628,ABRAHAM COWLEY,So early at my window do?
14629,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Cruel bird, thou’st ta’en away"
14630,ABRAHAM COWLEY,A dream out of my arms to-day;
14631,ABRAHAM COWLEY,A dream that ne’er must equall’d be
14632,ABRAHAM COWLEY,By all that waking eyes may see.
14633,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Thou this damage to repair
14634,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Nothing half so sweet and fair,"
14635,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Nothing half so good, canst bring,"
14636,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Tho’ men say thou bring’st the Spring.

14638,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14639,ABRAHAM COWLEY,_352._ _On the Death of Mr. William Hervey_
14640,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14641,ABRAHAM COWLEY,It was a dismal and a fearful night:
14642,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Scarce could the Morn drive on th’ unwilling Light,"
14643,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"When Sleep, Death’s image, left my troubled breast"
14644,ABRAHAM COWLEY,By something liker Death possest.
14645,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"My eyes with tears did uncommanded flow,"
14646,ABRAHAM COWLEY,And on my soul hung the dull weight
14647,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Of some intolerable fate.
14648,ABRAHAM COWLEY,What bell was that? Ah me! too much I know!
14649,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14650,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"My sweet companion and my gentle peer,"
14651,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Why hast thou left me thus unkindly here,"
14652,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Thy end for ever and my life to moan?
14653,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"O, thou hast left me all alone!"
14654,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Thy soul and body, when death’s agony"
14655,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Besieged around thy noble heart,"
14656,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Did not with more reluctance part
14657,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Than I, my dearest Friend, do part from thee."
14658,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14659,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"My dearest Friend, would I had died for thee!"
14660,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Life and this world henceforth will tedious be:
14661,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Nor shall I know hereafter what to do
14662,ABRAHAM COWLEY,If once my griefs prove tedious too.
14663,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Silent and sad I walk about all day,"
14664,ABRAHAM COWLEY,As sullen ghosts stalk speechless by
14665,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Where their hid treasures lie;
14666,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Alas! my treasure’s gone; why do I stay?
14667,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14668,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Say, for you saw us, ye immortal lights,"
14669,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"How oft unwearied have we spent the nights,"
14670,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Till the Ledæan stars, so famed for love,"
14671,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Wonder’d at us from above!
14672,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"We spent them not in toys, in lusts, or wine;"
14673,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"But search of deep Philosophy,"
14674,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Wit, Eloquence, and Poetry--"
14675,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Arts which I loved, for they, my Friend, were thine."
14676,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14677,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Ye fields of Cambridge, our dear Cambridge, say"
14678,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Have ye not seen us walking every day?
14679,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Was there a tree about which did not know
14680,ABRAHAM COWLEY,The love betwixt us two?
14681,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Henceforth, ye gentle trees, for ever fade;"
14682,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Or your sad branches thicker join
14683,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And into darksome shades combine,"
14684,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Dark as the grave wherein my Friend is laid!
14685,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14686,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Large was his soul: as large a soul as e’er
14687,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Submitted to inform a body here;
14688,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"High as the place ’twas shortly in Heaven to have,"
14689,ABRAHAM COWLEY,But low and humble as his grave.
14690,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"So high that all the virtues there did come,"
14691,ABRAHAM COWLEY,As to their chiefest seat
14692,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Conspicuous and great;
14693,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"So low, that for me too it made a room."
14694,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14695,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Knowledge he only sought, and so soon caught"
14696,ABRAHAM COWLEY,As if for him Knowledge had rather sought;
14697,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Nor did more learning ever crowded lie
14698,ABRAHAM COWLEY,In such a short mortality.
14699,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Whene’er the skilful youth discoursed or writ,"
14700,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Still did the notions throng
14701,ABRAHAM COWLEY,About his eloquent tongue;
14702,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Nor could his ink flow faster than his wit.
14703,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14704,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"His mirth was the pure spirits of various wit,"
14705,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Yet never did his God or friends forget;
14706,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And when deep talk and wisdom came in view,"
14707,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Retired, and gave to them their due."
14708,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"For the rich help of books he always took,"
14709,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Though his own searching mind before
14710,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Was so with notions written o’er,"
14711,ABRAHAM COWLEY,As if wise Nature had made that her book.
14712,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14713,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14714,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"With as much zeal, devotion, piety,"
14715,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"He always lived, as other saints do die."
14716,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Still with his soul severe account he kept,"
14717,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Weeping all debts out ere he slept.
14718,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Then down in peace and innocence he lay,"
14719,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Like the Sun’s laborious light,"
14720,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Which still in water sets at night,"
14721,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Unsullied with his journey of the day.
14722,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14723,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"But happy Thou, ta’en from this frantic age,"
14724,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Where ignorance and hypocrisy does rage!
14725,ABRAHAM COWLEY,A fitter time for Heaven no soul e’er chose--
14726,ABRAHAM COWLEY,The place now only free from those.
14727,ABRAHAM COWLEY,There ’mong the blest thou dost for ever shine;
14728,ABRAHAM COWLEY,And wheresoe’er thou casts thy view
14729,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Upon that white and radiant crew,"
14730,ABRAHAM COWLEY,See’st not a soul clothed with more light than thine.
14731,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14732,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14733,ABRAHAM COWLEY,_353._ _The Wish_
14734,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14735,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Well then! I now do plainly see
14736,ABRAHAM COWLEY,This busy world and I shall ne’er agree.
14737,ABRAHAM COWLEY,The very honey of all earthly joy
14738,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Does of all meats the soonest cloy;
14739,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And they, methinks, deserve my pity"
14740,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Who for it can endure the stings,"
14741,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"The crowd and buzz and murmurings,"
14742,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Of this great hive, the city."
14743,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14744,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Ah, yet, ere I descend to the grave"
14745,ABRAHAM COWLEY,May I a small house and large garden have;
14746,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And a few friends, and many books, both true,"
14747,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Both wise, and both delightful too!"
14748,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And since love ne’er will from me flee,"
14749,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"A Mistress moderately fair,"
14750,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And good as guardian angels are,"
14751,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Only beloved and loving me.
14752,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14753,ABRAHAM COWLEY,O fountains! when in you shall I
14754,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Myself eased of unpeaceful thoughts espy?
14755,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"O fields! O woods! when, when shall I be made"
14756,ABRAHAM COWLEY,The happy tenant of your shade?
14757,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Here’s the spring-head of Pleasure’s flood:
14758,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Here’s wealthy Nature’s treasury,"
14759,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Where all the riches lie that she
14760,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Has coin’d and stamp’d for good.
14761,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14762,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Pride and ambition here
14763,ABRAHAM COWLEY,Only in far-fetch’d metaphors appear;
14764,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Here nought but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter,"
14765,ABRAHAM COWLEY,And nought but Echo flatter.
14766,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"The gods, when they descended, hither"
14767,ABRAHAM COWLEY,From heaven did always choose their way:
14768,ABRAHAM COWLEY,And therefore we may boldly say
14769,ABRAHAM COWLEY,That ’tis the way too thither.
14770,ABRAHAM COWLEY,
14771,ABRAHAM COWLEY,How happy here should I
14772,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"And one dear She live, and embracing die!"
14773,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"She who is all the world, and can exclude"
14774,ABRAHAM COWLEY,In deserts solitude.
14775,ABRAHAM COWLEY,I should have then this only fear:
14776,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Lest men, when they my pleasures see,"
14777,ABRAHAM COWLEY,"Should hither throng to live like me,"
14778,ABRAHAM COWLEY,And so make a city here.

14796,ALEXANDER BROME,Though if I were to take my choice
14797,ALEXANDER BROME,I would have all these things:
14798,ALEXANDER BROME,"But if that thou wilt have me love,"
14799,ALEXANDER BROME,"And it must be a she,"
14800,ALEXANDER BROME,The only argument can move

14825,ANDREW MARVELL,
14826,ANDREW MARVELL,_upon Cromwell’s Return from Ireland_
14827,ANDREW MARVELL,
14828,ANDREW MARVELL,The forward youth that would appear
14829,ANDREW MARVELL,"Must now forsake his Muses dear,"
14830,ANDREW MARVELL,Nor in the shadows sing
14831,ANDREW MARVELL,His numbers languishing.
14832,ANDREW MARVELL,
14833,ANDREW MARVELL,"’Tis time to leave the books in dust,"
14834,ANDREW MARVELL,"And oil the unused armour’s rust,"
14835,ANDREW MARVELL,Removing from the wall
14836,ANDREW MARVELL,The corslet of the hall.
14837,ANDREW MARVELL,
14838,ANDREW MARVELL,So restless Cromwell could not cease
14839,ANDREW MARVELL,"In the inglorious arts of peace,"
14840,ANDREW MARVELL,But through adventurous war
14841,ANDREW MARVELL,Urgèd his active star:
14842,ANDREW MARVELL,
14843,ANDREW MARVELL,"And like the three-fork’d lightning, first"
14844,ANDREW MARVELL,"Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,"
14845,ANDREW MARVELL,Did thorough his own side
14846,ANDREW MARVELL,His fiery way divide:
14847,ANDREW MARVELL,
14848,ANDREW MARVELL,"For ’tis all one to courage high,"
14849,ANDREW MARVELL,"The emulous, or enemy;"
14850,ANDREW MARVELL,"And with such, to enclose"
14851,ANDREW MARVELL,Is more than to oppose.
14852,ANDREW MARVELL,
14853,ANDREW MARVELL,Then burning through the air he went
14854,ANDREW MARVELL,And palaces and temples rent;
14855,ANDREW MARVELL,And Cæsar’s head at last
14856,ANDREW MARVELL,Did through his laurels blast.
14857,ANDREW MARVELL,
14858,ANDREW MARVELL,
14859,ANDREW MARVELL,’Tis madness to resist or blame
14860,ANDREW MARVELL,The face of angry Heaven’s flame;
14861,ANDREW MARVELL,"And if we would speak true,"
14862,ANDREW MARVELL,"Much to the man is due,"
14863,ANDREW MARVELL,
14864,ANDREW MARVELL,"Who, from his private gardens, where"
14865,ANDREW MARVELL,He lived reservèd and austere
14866,ANDREW MARVELL,(As if his highest plot
14867,ANDREW MARVELL,"To plant the bergamot),"
14868,ANDREW MARVELL,
14869,ANDREW MARVELL,Could by industrious valour climb
14870,ANDREW MARVELL,"To ruin the great work of time,"
14871,ANDREW MARVELL,And cast the Kingdoms old
14872,ANDREW MARVELL,Into another mould;
14873,ANDREW MARVELL,
14874,ANDREW MARVELL,"Though Justice against Fate complain,"
14875,ANDREW MARVELL,And plead the ancient rights in vain--
14876,ANDREW MARVELL,But those do hold or break
14877,ANDREW MARVELL,As men are strong or weak--
14878,ANDREW MARVELL,
14879,ANDREW MARVELL,"Nature, that hateth emptiness,"
14880,ANDREW MARVELL,"Allows of penetration less,"
14881,ANDREW MARVELL,And therefore must make room
14882,ANDREW MARVELL,Where greater spirits come.
14883,ANDREW MARVELL,
14884,ANDREW MARVELL,What field of all the civil war
14885,ANDREW MARVELL,Where his were not the deepest scar?
14886,ANDREW MARVELL,And Hampton shows what part
14887,ANDREW MARVELL,He had of wiser art;
14888,ANDREW MARVELL,
14889,ANDREW MARVELL,"Where, twining subtle fears with hope,"
14890,ANDREW MARVELL,He wove a net of such a scope
14891,ANDREW MARVELL,That Charles himself might chase
14892,ANDREW MARVELL,To Caresbrooke’s narrow case;
14893,ANDREW MARVELL,That thence the Royal actor borne
14894,ANDREW MARVELL,The tragic scaffold might adorn:
14895,ANDREW MARVELL,While round the armèd bands
14896,ANDREW MARVELL,Did clap their bloody hands.
14897,ANDREW MARVELL,
14898,ANDREW MARVELL,He nothing common did or mean
14899,ANDREW MARVELL,"Upon that memorable scene,"
14900,ANDREW MARVELL,But with his keener eye
14901,ANDREW MARVELL,The axe’s edge did try;
14902,ANDREW MARVELL,
14903,ANDREW MARVELL,"Nor call’d the gods, with vulgar spite,"
14904,ANDREW MARVELL,To vindicate his helpless right;
14905,ANDREW MARVELL,But bow’d his comely head
14906,ANDREW MARVELL,"Down, as upon a bed."
14907,ANDREW MARVELL,
14908,ANDREW MARVELL,This was that memorable hour
14909,ANDREW MARVELL,Which first assured the forcèd power:
14910,ANDREW MARVELL,So when they did design
14911,ANDREW MARVELL,"The Capitol’s first line,"
14912,ANDREW MARVELL,
14913,ANDREW MARVELL,"A Bleeding Head, where they begun,"
14914,ANDREW MARVELL,Did fright the architects to run;
14915,ANDREW MARVELL,And yet in that the State
14916,ANDREW MARVELL,Foresaw its happy fate!
14917,ANDREW MARVELL,
14918,ANDREW MARVELL,And now the Irish are ashamed
14919,ANDREW MARVELL,To see themselves in one year tamed:
14920,ANDREW MARVELL,So much one man can do
14921,ANDREW MARVELL,That does both act and know.
14922,ANDREW MARVELL,
14923,ANDREW MARVELL,"They can affirm his praises best,"
14924,ANDREW MARVELL,"And have, though overcome, confest"
14925,ANDREW MARVELL,"How good he is, how just"
14926,ANDREW MARVELL,And fit for highest trust.
14927,ANDREW MARVELL,
14928,ANDREW MARVELL,
14929,ANDREW MARVELL,"Nor yet grown stiffer with command,"
14930,ANDREW MARVELL,But still in the republic’s hand--
14931,ANDREW MARVELL,How fit he is to sway
14932,ANDREW MARVELL,That can so well obey!
14933,ANDREW MARVELL,
14934,ANDREW MARVELL,He to the Commons’ feet presents
14935,ANDREW MARVELL,"A Kingdom for his first year’s rents,"
14936,ANDREW MARVELL,"And, what he may, forbears"
14937,ANDREW MARVELL,"His fame, to make it theirs:"
14938,ANDREW MARVELL,
14939,ANDREW MARVELL,And has his sword and spoils ungirt
14940,ANDREW MARVELL,To lay them at the public’s skirt.
14941,ANDREW MARVELL,So when the falcon high
14942,ANDREW MARVELL,"Falls heavy from the sky,"
14943,ANDREW MARVELL,
14944,ANDREW MARVELL,"She, having kill’d, no more doth search"
14945,ANDREW MARVELL,But on the next green bough to perch;
14946,ANDREW MARVELL,"Where, when he first does lure,"
14947,ANDREW MARVELL,The falconer has her sure.
14948,ANDREW MARVELL,
14949,ANDREW MARVELL,What may not then our Isle presume
14950,ANDREW MARVELL,While victory his crest does plume?
14951,ANDREW MARVELL,"What may not others fear,"
14952,ANDREW MARVELL,If thus he crowns each year?
14953,ANDREW MARVELL,
14954,ANDREW MARVELL,"As Cæsar he, ere long, to Gaul,"
14955,ANDREW MARVELL,"To Italy an Hannibal,"
14956,ANDREW MARVELL,And to all States not free
14957,ANDREW MARVELL,Shall climacteric be.
14958,ANDREW MARVELL,
14959,ANDREW MARVELL,The Pict no shelter now shall find
14960,ANDREW MARVELL,"Within his particolour’d mind,"

14962,ANDREW MARVELL,Shrink underneath the plaid;
14963,ANDREW MARVELL,"Happy, if in the tufted brake"
14964,ANDREW MARVELL,"The English hunter him mistake,"
14965,ANDREW MARVELL,Nor lay his hounds in near
14966,ANDREW MARVELL,The Caledonian deer.
14967,ANDREW MARVELL,
14968,ANDREW MARVELL,"But thou, the war’s and fortune’s son,"
14969,ANDREW MARVELL,March indefatigably on;
14970,ANDREW MARVELL,"And for the last effect,"
14971,ANDREW MARVELL,Still keep the sword erect:
14972,ANDREW MARVELL,
14973,ANDREW MARVELL,Besides the force it has to fright
14974,ANDREW MARVELL,"The spirits of the shady night,"
14975,ANDREW MARVELL,The same arts that did gain

14999,ANDREW MARVELL,"But, to exclude the world, did guard"
15000,ANDREW MARVELL,With wat’ry if not flaming sword;
15001,ANDREW MARVELL,What luckless apple did we taste
15002,ANDREW MARVELL,To make us mortal and thee waste!
15003,ANDREW MARVELL,Unhappy! shall we never more
15004,ANDREW MARVELL,"That sweet militia restore,"
15005,ANDREW MARVELL,"When gardens only had their towers,"
15006,ANDREW MARVELL,And all the garrisons were flowers;
15007,ANDREW MARVELL,"When roses only arms might bear,"
15008,ANDREW MARVELL,And men did rosy garlands wear?

15011,ANDREW MARVELL,_357._ _To His Coy Mistress_
15012,ANDREW MARVELL,
15013,ANDREW MARVELL,"Had we but world enough, and time,"
15014,ANDREW MARVELL,"This coyness, Lady, were no crime"
15015,ANDREW MARVELL,We would sit down and think which way
15016,ANDREW MARVELL,To walk and pass our long love’s day.
15017,ANDREW MARVELL,Thou by the Indian Ganges’ side
15018,ANDREW MARVELL,Shouldst rubies find: I by the tide
15019,ANDREW MARVELL,Of Humber would complain. I would
15020,ANDREW MARVELL,"Love you ten years before the Flood,"
15021,ANDREW MARVELL,"And you should, if you please, refuse"
15022,ANDREW MARVELL,Till the conversion of the Jews.
15023,ANDREW MARVELL,My vegetable love should grow
15024,ANDREW MARVELL,"Vaster than empires, and more slow;"
15025,ANDREW MARVELL,An hundred years should go to praise
15026,ANDREW MARVELL,Thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze;
15027,ANDREW MARVELL,"Two hundred to adore each breast,"
15028,ANDREW MARVELL,But thirty thousand to the rest;
15029,ANDREW MARVELL,"An age at least to every part,"
15030,ANDREW MARVELL,And the last age should show your heart.
15031,ANDREW MARVELL,"For, Lady, you deserve this state,"
15032,ANDREW MARVELL,Nor would I love at lower rate.
15033,ANDREW MARVELL,But at my back I always hear
15034,ANDREW MARVELL,Time’s winged chariot hurrying near;
15035,ANDREW MARVELL,And yonder all before us lie
15036,ANDREW MARVELL,Deserts of vast eternity.
15037,ANDREW MARVELL,"Thy beauty shall no more be found,"
15038,ANDREW MARVELL,"Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound"
15039,ANDREW MARVELL,My echoing song: then worms shall try
15040,ANDREW MARVELL,"That long preserved virginity,"
15041,ANDREW MARVELL,"And your quaint honour turn to dust,"
15042,ANDREW MARVELL,And into ashes all my lust:
15043,ANDREW MARVELL,"The grave’s a fine and private place,"
15044,ANDREW MARVELL,"But none, I think, do there embrace."
15045,ANDREW MARVELL,"Now therefore, while the youthful hue"
15046,ANDREW MARVELL,"Sits on thy skin like morning dew,"
15047,ANDREW MARVELL,And while thy willing soul transpires
15048,ANDREW MARVELL,"At every pore with instant fires,"
15049,ANDREW MARVELL,"Now let us sport us while we may,"
15050,ANDREW MARVELL,"And now, like amorous birds of prey,"
15051,ANDREW MARVELL,Rather at once our time devour
15052,ANDREW MARVELL,Than languish in his slow-chapt power.
15053,ANDREW MARVELL,Let us roll all our strength and all
15054,ANDREW MARVELL,"Our sweetness up into one ball,"
15055,ANDREW MARVELL,And tear our pleasures with rough strife
15056,ANDREW MARVELL,Thorough the iron gates of life:
15057,ANDREW MARVELL,"Thus, though we cannot make our sun"
15058,ANDREW MARVELL,"Stand still, yet we will make him run."
15059,ANDREW MARVELL,
15060,ANDREW MARVELL,"slow-chapt] slow-jawed, slowly devouring."

15062,ANDREW MARVELL,_358._ _The Picture of Little T. C. in a Prospect of Flowers_
15063,ANDREW MARVELL,
15064,ANDREW MARVELL,See with what simplicity
15065,ANDREW MARVELL,This nymph begins her golden days!
15066,ANDREW MARVELL,"In the green grass she loves to lie,"
15067,ANDREW MARVELL,And there with her fair aspect tames
15068,ANDREW MARVELL,"The wilder flowers, and gives them names;"
15069,ANDREW MARVELL,"But only with the roses plays,"
15070,ANDREW MARVELL,And them does tell
15071,ANDREW MARVELL,"What colour best becomes them, and what smell."
15072,ANDREW MARVELL,
15073,ANDREW MARVELL,Who can foretell for what high cause
15074,ANDREW MARVELL,This darling of the gods was born?
15075,ANDREW MARVELL,Yet this is she whose chaster laws
15076,ANDREW MARVELL,"The wanton Love shall one day fear,"
15077,ANDREW MARVELL,"And, under her command severe,"
15078,ANDREW MARVELL,See his bow broke and ensigns torn.
15079,ANDREW MARVELL,Happy who can
15080,ANDREW MARVELL,Appease this virtuous enemy of man!
15081,ANDREW MARVELL,
15082,ANDREW MARVELL,O then let me in time compound
15083,ANDREW MARVELL,"And parley with those conquering eyes,"
15084,ANDREW MARVELL,Ere they have tried their force to wound;
15085,ANDREW MARVELL,Ere with their glancing wheels they drive
15086,ANDREW MARVELL,"In triumph over hearts that strive,"
15087,ANDREW MARVELL,And them that yield but more despise:
15088,ANDREW MARVELL,"Let me be laid,"
15089,ANDREW MARVELL,Where I may see the glories from some shade.
15090,ANDREW MARVELL,
15091,ANDREW MARVELL,"Meantime, whilst every verdant thing"
15092,ANDREW MARVELL,"Itself does at thy beauty charm,"
15093,ANDREW MARVELL,Reform the errors of the Spring;
15094,ANDREW MARVELL,Make that the tulips may have share
15095,ANDREW MARVELL,"Of sweetness, seeing they are fair,"
15096,ANDREW MARVELL,And roses of their thorns disarm;
15097,ANDREW MARVELL,But most procure
15098,ANDREW MARVELL,That violets may a longer age endure.
15099,ANDREW MARVELL,
15100,ANDREW MARVELL,"But O, young beauty of the woods,"
15101,ANDREW MARVELL,"Whom Nature courts with fruits and flowers,"
15102,ANDREW MARVELL,"Gather the flowers, but spare the buds;"
15103,ANDREW MARVELL,"Lest Flora, angry at thy crime"
15104,ANDREW MARVELL,"To kill her infants in their prime,"
15105,ANDREW MARVELL,Do quickly make th’ example yours;
15106,ANDREW MARVELL,"And ere we see,"
15107,ANDREW MARVELL,Nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee.

15110,ANDREW MARVELL,_359._ _Thoughts in a Garden_
15111,ANDREW MARVELL,
15112,ANDREW MARVELL,How vainly men themselves amaze
15113,ANDREW MARVELL,"To win the palm, the oak, or bays,"
15114,ANDREW MARVELL,And their uncessant labours see
15115,ANDREW MARVELL,"Crown’d from some single herb or tree,"
15116,ANDREW MARVELL,Whose short and narrow-vergèd shade
15117,ANDREW MARVELL,Does prudently their toils upbraid;
15118,ANDREW MARVELL,While all the flowers and trees do close
15119,ANDREW MARVELL,To weave the garlands of repose!
15120,ANDREW MARVELL,
15121,ANDREW MARVELL,"Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,"
15122,ANDREW MARVELL,And Innocence thy sister dear?
15123,ANDREW MARVELL,"Mistaken long, I sought you then"
15124,ANDREW MARVELL,In busy companies of men:
15125,ANDREW MARVELL,"Your sacred plants, if here below,"
15126,ANDREW MARVELL,Only among the plants will grow:
15127,ANDREW MARVELL,Society is all but rude
15128,ANDREW MARVELL,To this delicious solitude.
15129,ANDREW MARVELL,
15130,ANDREW MARVELL,No white nor red was ever seen
15131,ANDREW MARVELL,So amorous as this lovely green.
15132,ANDREW MARVELL,"Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,"
15133,ANDREW MARVELL,Cut in these trees their mistress’ name:
15134,ANDREW MARVELL,"Little, alas! they know or heed"
15135,ANDREW MARVELL,How far these beauties hers exceed!
15136,ANDREW MARVELL,"Fair trees! wheres’e’er your barks I wound,"
15137,ANDREW MARVELL,No name shall but your own be found.
15138,ANDREW MARVELL,
15139,ANDREW MARVELL,"When we have run our passions’ heat,"
15140,ANDREW MARVELL,Love hither makes his best retreat:
15141,ANDREW MARVELL,"The gods, that mortal beauty chase,"
15142,ANDREW MARVELL,Still in a tree did end their race;
15143,ANDREW MARVELL,Apollo hunted Daphne so
15144,ANDREW MARVELL,Only that she might laurel grow;
15145,ANDREW MARVELL,And Pan did after Syrinx speed
15146,ANDREW MARVELL,"Not as a nymph, but for a reed."
15147,ANDREW MARVELL,
15148,ANDREW MARVELL,What wondrous life in this I lead!
15149,ANDREW MARVELL,Ripe apples drop about my head;
15150,ANDREW MARVELL,The luscious clusters of the vine
15151,ANDREW MARVELL,Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
15152,ANDREW MARVELL,The nectarine and curious peach
15153,ANDREW MARVELL,Into my hands themselves do reach;
15154,ANDREW MARVELL,"Stumbling on melons, as I pass,"
15155,ANDREW MARVELL,"Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass."
15156,ANDREW MARVELL,
15157,ANDREW MARVELL,Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less
15158,ANDREW MARVELL,Withdraws into its happiness;
15159,ANDREW MARVELL,"The mind, that ocean where each kind"
15160,ANDREW MARVELL,Does straight its own resemblance find;
15161,ANDREW MARVELL,"Yet it creates, transcending these,"
15162,ANDREW MARVELL,"Far other worlds, and other seas;"
15163,ANDREW MARVELL,Annihilating all that’s made
15164,ANDREW MARVELL,To a green thought in a green shade.
15165,ANDREW MARVELL,
15166,ANDREW MARVELL,"Here at the fountain’s sliding foot,"
15167,ANDREW MARVELL,"Or at some fruit-tree’s mossy root,"
15168,ANDREW MARVELL,"Casting the body’s vest aside,"
15169,ANDREW MARVELL,My soul into the boughs does glide;
15170,ANDREW MARVELL,"There, like a bird, it sits and sings,"
15171,ANDREW MARVELL,"Then whets and combs its silver wings,"
15172,ANDREW MARVELL,"And, till prepared for longer flight,"
15173,ANDREW MARVELL,Waves in its plumes the various light.
15174,ANDREW MARVELL,
15175,ANDREW MARVELL,Such was that happy Garden-state
15176,ANDREW MARVELL,While man there walk’d without a mate:
15177,ANDREW MARVELL,"After a place so pure and sweet,"
15178,ANDREW MARVELL,What other help could yet be meet!
15179,ANDREW MARVELL,But ’twas beyond a mortal’s share
15180,ANDREW MARVELL,To wander solitary there:
15181,ANDREW MARVELL,"Two paradises ’twere in one,"
15182,ANDREW MARVELL,To live in Paradise alone.
15183,ANDREW MARVELL,
15184,ANDREW MARVELL,How well the skilful gard’ner drew
15185,ANDREW MARVELL,Of flowers and herbs this dial new!
15186,ANDREW MARVELL,"Where, from above, the milder sun"
15187,ANDREW MARVELL,Does through a fragrant zodiac run:
15188,ANDREW MARVELL,"And, as it works, th’ industrious bee"
15189,ANDREW MARVELL,Computes its time as well as we.
15190,ANDREW MARVELL,How could such sweet and wholesome hours
15191,ANDREW MARVELL,"Be reckon’d, but with herbs and flowers!"

15196,ANDREW MARVELL,Where the remote Bermudas ride
15197,ANDREW MARVELL,"In the ocean’s bosom unespied,"
15198,ANDREW MARVELL,From a small boat that row’d along
15199,ANDREW MARVELL,The listening woods received this song:
15200,ANDREW MARVELL,
15201,ANDREW MARVELL,‘What should we do but sing His praise
15202,ANDREW MARVELL,That led us through the watery maze
15203,ANDREW MARVELL,"Unto an isle so long unknown,"
15204,ANDREW MARVELL,And yet far kinder than our own?
15205,ANDREW MARVELL,"Where He the huge sea-monsters wracks,"
15206,ANDREW MARVELL,"That lift the deep upon their backs,"
15207,ANDREW MARVELL,"He lands us on a grassy stage,"
15208,ANDREW MARVELL,Safe from the storms’ and prelates’ rage:
15209,ANDREW MARVELL,He gave us this eternal Spring
15210,ANDREW MARVELL,"Which here enamels everything,"
15211,ANDREW MARVELL,And sends the fowls to us in care
15212,ANDREW MARVELL,On daily visits through the air:
15213,ANDREW MARVELL,He hangs in shades the orange bright
15214,ANDREW MARVELL,"Like golden lamps in a green night,"
15215,ANDREW MARVELL,And does in the pomegranates close
15216,ANDREW MARVELL,Jewels more rich than Ormus shows:
15217,ANDREW MARVELL,He makes the figs our mouths to meet
15218,ANDREW MARVELL,And throws the melons at our feet;
15219,ANDREW MARVELL,"But apples plants of such a price,"
15220,ANDREW MARVELL,No tree could ever bear them twice.
15221,ANDREW MARVELL,With cedars chosen by His hand
15222,ANDREW MARVELL,From Lebanon He stores the land;
15223,ANDREW MARVELL,And makes the hollow seas that roar
15224,ANDREW MARVELL,Proclaim the ambergris on shore.
15225,ANDREW MARVELL,He cast (of which we rather boast)
15226,ANDREW MARVELL,The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast;
15227,ANDREW MARVELL,And in these rocks for us did frame
15228,ANDREW MARVELL,A temple where to sound His name.
15229,ANDREW MARVELL,"O, let our voice His praise exalt"
15230,ANDREW MARVELL,"Till it arrive at Heaven’s vault,"
15231,ANDREW MARVELL,Which thence (perhaps) rebounding may
15232,ANDREW MARVELL,Echo beyond the Mexique bay!’
15233,ANDREW MARVELL,
15234,ANDREW MARVELL,Thus sung they in the English boat
15235,ANDREW MARVELL,A holy and a cheerful note:
15236,ANDREW MARVELL,"And all the way, to guide their chime,"
15237,ANDREW MARVELL,With falling oars they kept the time.

15247,ANDREW MARVELL,"Without detracting, her commend."
15248,ANDREW MARVELL,
15249,ANDREW MARVELL,To say--she lived a virgin chaste
15250,ANDREW MARVELL,In this age loose and all unlaced;
15251,ANDREW MARVELL,"Nor was, when vice is so allowed,"
15252,ANDREW MARVELL,Of virtue or ashamed or proud;
15253,ANDREW MARVELL,"That her soul was on Heaven so bent,"
15254,ANDREW MARVELL,No minute but it came and went;
15255,ANDREW MARVELL,"That, ready her last debt to pay,"
15256,ANDREW MARVELL,She summ’d her life up every day;

15274,HENRY VAUGHAN,Before I understood this place
15275,HENRY VAUGHAN,"Appointed for my second race,"
15276,HENRY VAUGHAN,Or taught my soul to fancy aught
15277,HENRY VAUGHAN,But a white celestial thought:
15278,HENRY VAUGHAN,When yet I had not walk’d above
15279,HENRY VAUGHAN,"A mile or two from my first Love,"
15280,HENRY VAUGHAN,And looking back--at that short space--
15281,HENRY VAUGHAN,Could see a glimpse of His bright face:
15282,HENRY VAUGHAN,"When on some gilded cloud, or flow’r,"
15283,HENRY VAUGHAN,"My gazing soul would dwell an hour,"
15284,HENRY VAUGHAN,And in those weaker glories spy
15285,HENRY VAUGHAN,Some shadows of eternity:
15286,HENRY VAUGHAN,Before I taught my tongue to wound

15288,HENRY VAUGHAN,Or had the black art to dispense
15289,HENRY VAUGHAN,"A several sin to ev’ry sense,"

15291,HENRY VAUGHAN,Bright shoots of everlastingness.
15292,HENRY VAUGHAN,
15293,HENRY VAUGHAN,"O how I long to travel back,"
15294,HENRY VAUGHAN,And tread again that ancient track!
15295,HENRY VAUGHAN,That I might once more reach that plain

15297,HENRY VAUGHAN,From whence th’ enlightned spirit sees
15298,HENRY VAUGHAN,That shady City of Palm-trees.

15300,HENRY VAUGHAN,"Is drunk, and staggers in the way!"
15301,HENRY VAUGHAN,"Some men a forward motion love,"
15302,HENRY VAUGHAN,But I by backward steps would move;

17781,JOHN DRYDEN,To make thyself a welcome inmate there;
17782,JOHN DRYDEN,"While yet a young probationer,"

17785,JOHN DRYDEN,"If by traduction came thy mind,"

17845,JOHN DRYDEN,And to be read herself she need not fear;
17846,JOHN DRYDEN,"Each test, and every light, her Muse will bear,"
17847,JOHN DRYDEN,Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
17848,JOHN DRYDEN,Even love (for love sometimes her Muse exprest)

19095,ISAAC WATTS,
19096,ISAAC WATTS,When the fierce North-wind with his airy forces
19097,ISAAC WATTS,Rears up the Baltic to a foaming fury;
19098,ISAAC WATTS,And the red lightning with a storm of hail comes
19099,ISAAC WATTS,Rushing amain down;
19100,ISAAC WATTS,
19101,ISAAC WATTS,"How the poor sailors stand amazed and tremble,"
19102,ISAAC WATTS,"While the hoarse thunder, like a bloody trumpet,"
19103,ISAAC WATTS,Roars a loud onset to the gaping waters
19104,ISAAC WATTS,Quick to devour them.
19105,ISAAC WATTS,
19106,ISAAC WATTS,
19107,ISAAC WATTS,"Such shall the noise be, and the wild disorder"
19108,ISAAC WATTS,"(If things eternal may be like these earthly),"
19109,ISAAC WATTS,Such the dire terror when the great Archangel
19110,ISAAC WATTS,Shakes the creation;
19111,ISAAC WATTS,
19112,ISAAC WATTS,"Tears the strong pillars of the vault of Heaven,"
19113,ISAAC WATTS,"Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes,"
19114,ISAAC WATTS,"Sees the graves open, and the bones arising,"
19115,ISAAC WATTS,Flames all around them.
19116,ISAAC WATTS,
19117,ISAAC WATTS,"Hark, the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches!"
19118,ISAAC WATTS,Lively bright horror and amazing anguish
19119,ISAAC WATTS,"Stare thro’ their eyelids, while the living worm lies"
19120,ISAAC WATTS,Gnawing within them.
19121,ISAAC WATTS,
19122,ISAAC WATTS,"Thoughts, like old vultures, prey upon their heart-strings,"
19123,ISAAC WATTS,"And the smart twinges, when the eye beholds the"

19125,ISAAC WATTS,Rolling afore him.
19126,ISAAC WATTS,
19127,ISAAC WATTS,"Hopeless immortals! how they scream and shiver,"
19128,ISAAC WATTS,While devils push them to the pit wide-yawning
19129,ISAAC WATTS,"Hideous and gloomy, to receive them headlong"
19130,ISAAC WATTS,Down to the centre!
19131,ISAAC WATTS,
19132,ISAAC WATTS,"Stop here, my fancy: (all away, ye horrid"
19133,ISAAC WATTS,"Doleful ideas!) come, arise to Jesus,"
19134,ISAAC WATTS,How He sits God-like! and the saints around Him
19135,ISAAC WATTS,"Throned, yet adoring!"
19136,ISAAC WATTS,
19137,ISAAC WATTS,"O may I sit there when He comes triumphant,"
19138,ISAAC WATTS,"Dooming the nations! then ascend to glory,"

19140,ISAAC WATTS,Shout the Redeemer.

19146,ISAAC WATTS,Holy angels guard thy bed!
19147,ISAAC WATTS,Heavenly blessings without number
19148,ISAAC WATTS,Gently falling on thy head.
19149,ISAAC WATTS,
19150,ISAAC WATTS,"Sleep, my babe; thy food and raiment,"
19151,ISAAC WATTS,"House and home, thy friends provide;"
19152,ISAAC WATTS,All without thy care or payment:
19153,ISAAC WATTS,All thy wants are well supplied.
19154,ISAAC WATTS,
19155,ISAAC WATTS,How much better thou’rt attended
19156,ISAAC WATTS,"Than the Son of God could be,"
19157,ISAAC WATTS,When from heaven He descended
19158,ISAAC WATTS,And became a child like thee!
19159,ISAAC WATTS,
19160,ISAAC WATTS,Soft and easy is thy cradle:
19161,ISAAC WATTS,"Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,"
19162,ISAAC WATTS,When His birthplace was a stable
19163,ISAAC WATTS,And His softest bed was hay.
19164,ISAAC WATTS,
19165,ISAAC WATTS,Blessèd babe! what glorious features--
19166,ISAAC WATTS,"Spotless fair, divinely bright!"
19167,ISAAC WATTS,Must He dwell with brutal creatures?
19168,ISAAC WATTS,How could angels bear the sight?
19169,ISAAC WATTS,
19170,ISAAC WATTS,Was there nothing but a manger
19171,ISAAC WATTS,Cursèd sinners could afford
19172,ISAAC WATTS,To receive the heavenly stranger?
19173,ISAAC WATTS,Did they thus affront their Lord?
19174,ISAAC WATTS,
19175,ISAAC WATTS,
19176,ISAAC WATTS,"Soft, my child: I did not chide thee,"
19177,ISAAC WATTS,Though my song might sound too hard;
19178,ISAAC WATTS,"’Tis thy mother sits beside thee,"
19179,ISAAC WATTS,And her arms shall be thy guard.
19180,ISAAC WATTS,
19181,ISAAC WATTS,Yet to read the shameful story
19182,ISAAC WATTS,"How the Jews abused their King,"
19183,ISAAC WATTS,"How they served the Lord of Glory,"
19184,ISAAC WATTS,Makes me angry while I sing.
19185,ISAAC WATTS,
19186,ISAAC WATTS,"See the kinder shepherds round Him,"
19187,ISAAC WATTS,Telling wonders from the sky!
19188,ISAAC WATTS,"Where they sought Him, there they found Him,"
19189,ISAAC WATTS,With His Virgin mother by.
19190,ISAAC WATTS,
19191,ISAAC WATTS,See the lovely babe a-dressing;
19192,ISAAC WATTS,"Lovely infant, how He smiled!"
19193,ISAAC WATTS,"When He wept, the mother’s blessing"
19194,ISAAC WATTS,Soothed and hush’d the holy child.
19195,ISAAC WATTS,
19196,ISAAC WATTS,"Lo, He slumbers in His manger,"
19197,ISAAC WATTS,Where the hornèd oxen fed:
19198,ISAAC WATTS,"Peace, my darling; here’s no danger,"
19199,ISAAC WATTS,Here’s no ox anear thy bed.
19200,ISAAC WATTS,
19201,ISAAC WATTS,"’Twas to save thee, child, from dying,"
19202,ISAAC WATTS,"Save my dear from burning flame,"
19203,ISAAC WATTS,"Bitter groans and endless crying,"
19204,ISAAC WATTS,That thy blest Redeemer came.
19205,ISAAC WATTS,
19206,ISAAC WATTS,"May’st thou live to know and fear Him,"
19207,ISAAC WATTS,Trust and love Him all thy days;

19370,ALEXANDER POPE,"Why bade ye else, ye Pow’rs! her soul aspire"
19371,ALEXANDER POPE,Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
19372,ALEXANDER POPE,Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
19373,ALEXANDER POPE,The glorious fault of angels and of gods;
19374,ALEXANDER POPE,"Thence to their images on earth it flows,"

19384,ALEXANDER POPE,"As into air the purer spirits flow,"

19424,ALEXANDER POPE,"There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,"
19425,ALEXANDER POPE,There the first roses of the year shall blow;
19426,ALEXANDER POPE,While angels with their silver wings o’ershade

19522,HENRY CAREY,Is half so sweet as Sally;
19523,HENRY CAREY,"She is the darling of my heart,"

19525,HENRY CAREY,
19526,HENRY CAREY,"Her father he makes cabbage-nets,"
19527,HENRY CAREY,And through the streets does cry ’em;
19528,HENRY CAREY,Her mother she sells laces long

19567,HENRY CAREY,I’d give it all to Sally;

19571,HENRY CAREY,My master and the neighbours all

19574,HENRY CAREY,A slave and row a galley;
19575,HENRY CAREY,"But when my seven long years are out,"

22499,JAMES HOGG,
22500,JAMES HOGG,"They bore her away, she wist not how,"
22501,JAMES HOGG,For she felt not arm nor rest below;
22502,JAMES HOGG,"But so swift they wain’d her through the light,"
22503,JAMES HOGG,’Twas like the motion of sound or sight;

22528,JAMES HOGG,"She look’d, and she saw nae land aright,"
22529,JAMES HOGG,But an endless whirl of glory and light:
22530,JAMES HOGG,"And radiant beings went and came,"
22531,JAMES HOGG,"Far swifter than wind, or the linkèd flame."
22532,JAMES HOGG,She hid her e’en frae the dazzling view;

22534,JAMES HOGG,

22536,JAMES HOGG,And clouds of amber sailing bye;
22537,JAMES HOGG,"A lovely land beneath her lay,"
22538,JAMES HOGG,And that land had glens and mountains gray;
22539,JAMES HOGG,"And that land had valleys and hoary piles,"
22540,JAMES HOGG,"And marlèd seas, and a thousand isles."
22541,JAMES HOGG,"Its fields were speckled, its forests green"

22543,JAMES HOGG,"Like magic mirrors, where slumbering lay"
22544,JAMES HOGG,The sun and the sky and the cloudlet gray;
22545,JAMES HOGG,"Which heaved and trembled, and gently swung,"
22546,JAMES HOGG,On every shore they seem’d to be hung;
22547,JAMES HOGG,For there they were seen on their downward plain
22548,JAMES HOGG,A thousand times and a thousand again;
22549,JAMES HOGG,"In winding lake and placid firth,"
22550,JAMES HOGG,Little peaceful heavens in the bosom of earth.

22552,JAMES HOGG,"marlèd] variegated, parti-coloured."
22553,JAMES HOGG,
22554,JAMES HOGG,"Kilmeny sigh’d and seem’d to grieve,"
22555,JAMES HOGG,For she found her heart to that land did cleave;
22556,JAMES HOGG,"She saw the corn wave on the vale,"
22557,JAMES HOGG,She saw the deer run down the dale;
22558,JAMES HOGG,"She saw the plaid and the broad claymore,"
22559,JAMES HOGG,And the brows that the badge of freedom bore;
22560,JAMES HOGG,And she thought she had seen the land before.
22561,JAMES HOGG,
22562,JAMES HOGG,"She saw a lady sit on a throne,"
22563,JAMES HOGG,The fairest that ever the sun shone on!
22564,JAMES HOGG,"A lion lick’d her hand of milk,"
22565,JAMES HOGG,And she held him in a leish of silk;
22566,JAMES HOGG,"And a leifu’ maiden stood at her knee,"
22567,JAMES HOGG,With a silver wand and melting e’e;
22568,JAMES HOGG,"Her sovereign shield till love stole in,"
22569,JAMES HOGG,And poison’d all the fount within.
22570,JAMES HOGG,
22571,JAMES HOGG,"Then a gruff untoward bedesman came,"
22572,JAMES HOGG,And hundit the lion on his dame;
22573,JAMES HOGG,"And the guardian maid wi’ the dauntless e’e,"
22574,JAMES HOGG,"She dropp’d a tear, and left her knee;"
22575,JAMES HOGG,"And she saw till the queen frae the lion fled,"
22576,JAMES HOGG,Till the bonniest flower of the world lay dead;
22577,JAMES HOGG,"A coffin was set on a distant plain,"
22578,JAMES HOGG,And she saw the red blood fall like rain;
22579,JAMES HOGG,"Then bonnie Kilmeny’s heart grew sair,"
22580,JAMES HOGG,"And she turn’d away, and could look nae mair."
22581,JAMES HOGG,
22582,JAMES HOGG,"Then the gruff grim carle girn’d amain,"
22583,JAMES HOGG,"And they trampled him down, but he rose again;"
22584,JAMES HOGG,"And he baited the lion to deeds of weir,"
22585,JAMES HOGG,Till he lapp’d the blood to the kingdom dear;

22591,JAMES HOGG,"He gowl’d at the carle, and chased him away"
22592,JAMES HOGG,To feed wi’ the deer on the mountain gray.
22593,JAMES HOGG,"He gowl’d at the carle, and geck’d at Heaven,"
22594,JAMES HOGG,"But his mark was set, and his arles given."
22595,JAMES HOGG,Kilmeny a while her e’en withdrew;
22596,JAMES HOGG,"She look’d again, and the scene was new."
22597,JAMES HOGG,
22598,JAMES HOGG,She saw before her fair unfurl’d
22599,JAMES HOGG,"One half of all the glowing world,"
22600,JAMES HOGG,"Where oceans roll’d, and rivers ran,"
22601,JAMES HOGG,To bound the aims of sinful man.
22602,JAMES HOGG,"She saw a people, fierce and fell,"
22603,JAMES HOGG,Burst frae their bounds like fiends of hell;
22604,JAMES HOGG,"Their lilies grew, and the eagle flew;"
22605,JAMES HOGG,"And she herkèd on her ravening crew,"
22606,JAMES HOGG,"Till the cities and towers were wrapp’d in a blaze,"
22607,JAMES HOGG,And the thunder it roar’d o’er the lands and the seas.
22608,JAMES HOGG,"The widows they wail’d, and the red blood ran,"
22609,JAMES HOGG,And she threatened an end to the race of man;
22610,JAMES HOGG,"She never lened, nor stood in awe,"
22611,JAMES HOGG,Till caught by the lion’s deadly paw.
22612,JAMES HOGG,"O, then the eagle swink’d for life,"
22613,JAMES HOGG,And brainyell’d up a mortal strife;
22614,JAMES HOGG,"But flew she north, or flew she south,"
22615,JAMES HOGG,She met wi’ the gowl o’ the lion’s mouth.
22616,JAMES HOGG,
22617,JAMES HOGG,"With a mooted wing and waefu’ maen,"
22618,JAMES HOGG,The eagle sought her eiry again;

22678,JAMES HOGG,"And when at even the woodlands rung,"
22679,JAMES HOGG,When hymns of other worlds she sung
22680,JAMES HOGG,"In ecstasy of sweet devotion,"

22682,JAMES HOGG,"The wild beasts of the forest came,"

23027,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Reaping and singing by herself;
23028,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Stop here, or gently pass!"
23029,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Alone she cuts and binds the grain,"
23030,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And sings a melancholy strain;
23031,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,O listen! for the Vale profound
23032,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Is overflowing with the sound.
23033,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23034,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,No Nightingale did ever chaunt
23035,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,More welcome notes to weary bands
23036,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Of travellers in some shady haunt,"
23037,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Among Arabian sands:
23038,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23039,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
23040,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,"
23041,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Breaking the silence of the seas
23042,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Among the farthest Hebrides.
23043,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23044,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Will no one tell me what she sings?--
23045,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
23046,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"For old, unhappy, far-off things,"
23047,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And battles long ago:
23048,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Or is it some more humble lay,"
23049,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Familiar matter of to-day?
23050,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,"
23051,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"That has been, and may be again?"
23052,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23053,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Whatever the theme, the Maiden sang"
23054,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,As if her song could have no ending;
23055,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I saw her singing at her work,"
23056,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And o'er the sickle bending;--
23057,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I listen'd, motionless and still;"
23058,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And, as I mounted up the hill,"
23059,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The music in my heart I bore,"
23060,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Long after it was heard no more.
23061,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23062,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,_529._ _Perfect Woman_
23063,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23064,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,She was a phantom of delight
23065,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,When first she gleam’d upon my sight;
23066,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A lovely apparition, sent"
23067,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To be a moment’s ornament;
23068,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Her eyes as stars of twilight fair;
23069,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Like twilight’s, too, her dusky hair;"
23070,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,But all things else about her drawn
23071,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,From May-time and the cheerful dawn;
23072,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A dancing shape, an image gay,"
23073,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"To haunt, to startle, and waylay."
23074,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23075,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23076,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I saw her upon nearer view,"
23077,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A Spirit, yet a Woman too!"
23078,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Her household motions light and free,"
23079,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And steps of virgin liberty;
23080,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A countenance in which did meet
23081,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Sweet records, promises as sweet;"
23082,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A creature not too bright or good
23083,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,For human nature’s daily food;
23084,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"For transient sorrows, simple wiles,"
23085,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles."
23086,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23087,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And now I see with eye serene
23088,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The very pulse of the machine;
23089,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A being breathing thoughtful breath,"
23090,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A traveller between life and death;
23091,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The reason firm, the temperate will,"
23092,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;"
23093,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A perfect Woman, nobly plann’d,"
23094,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"To warn, to comfort, and command;"
23095,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And yet a Spirit still, and bright"
23096,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,With something of angelic light.
23097,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23098,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23099,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,_530._ _Daffodils_
23100,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23101,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I wander’d lonely as a cloud
23102,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"That floats on high o’er vales and hills,"
23103,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"When all at once I saw a crowd,"
23104,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A host, of golden daffodils;"
23105,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Beside the lake, beneath the trees,"
23106,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
23107,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23108,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Continuous as the stars that shine
23109,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And twinkle on the Milky Way,"
23110,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,They stretch’d in never-ending line
23111,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Along the margin of a bay:
23112,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Ten thousand saw I at a glance,"
23113,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
23114,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23115,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The waves beside them danced, but they"
23116,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
23117,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A poet could not but be gay,"
23118,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,In such a jocund company:
23119,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
23120,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,What wealth the show to me had brought:
23121,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23122,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"For oft, when on my couch I lie"
23123,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"In vacant or in pensive mood,"
23124,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,They flash upon that inward eye
23125,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Which is the bliss of solitude;
23126,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And then my heart with pleasure fills,"
23127,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And dances with the daffodils.
23128,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,

23130,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,_531._ _Ode to Duty_
23131,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23132,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!
23133,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"O Duty! if that name thou love,"
23134,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Who art a light to guide, a rod"
23135,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To check the erring and reprove;
23136,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thou, who art victory and law"
23137,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,When empty terrors overawe;
23138,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,From vain temptations dost set free;
23139,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And calm’st the weary strife of frail humanity!
23140,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23141,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,There are who ask not if thine eye
23142,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Be on them; who, in love and truth,"
23143,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Where no misgiving is, rely"
23144,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Upon the genial sense of youth:
23145,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Glad hearts! without reproach or blot;
23146,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Who do thy work, and know it not:"
23147,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"O, if through confidence misplaced"
23148,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast."
23149,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23150,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Serene will be our days and bright,"
23151,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And happy will our nature be,"
23152,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"When love is an unerring light,"
23153,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And joy its own security.
23154,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And they a blissful course may hold
23155,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Even now, who, not unwisely bold,"
23156,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Live in the spirit of this creed;
23157,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need."
23158,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23159,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I, loving freedom, and untried;"
23160,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"No sport of every random gust,"
23161,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Yet being to myself a guide,"
23162,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Too blindly have reposed my trust:
23163,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And oft, when in my heart was heard"
23164,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thy timely mandate, I deferr’d"
23165,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The task, in smoother walks to stray;"
23166,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may."
23167,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23168,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Through no disturbance of my soul,"
23169,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Or strong compunction in me wrought,"
23170,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I supplicate for thy control;
23171,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,But in the quietness of thought.
23172,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Me this uncharter’d freedom tires;
23173,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I feel the weight of chance-desires;
23174,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"My hopes no more must change their name,"
23175,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I long for a repose that ever is the same.
23176,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23177,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Yet not the less would I throughout
23178,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Still act according to the voice
23179,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Of my own wish; and feel past doubt
23180,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,That my submissiveness was choice:
23181,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Not seeking in the school of pride
23182,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"For ‘precepts over dignified,’"
23183,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Denial and restraint I prize
23184,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,No farther than they breed a second Will more wise.
23185,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23186,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
23187,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The Godhead’s most benignant grace;
23188,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Nor know we anything so fair
23189,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,As is the smile upon thy face:
23190,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,"
23191,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And fragrance in thy footing treads;
23192,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;
23193,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong."
23194,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23195,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"To humbler functions, awful Power!"
23196,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I call thee: I myself commend
23197,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Unto thy guidance from this hour;
23198,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"O, let my weakness have an end!"
23199,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Give unto me, made lowly wise,"
23200,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The spirit of self-sacrifice;
23201,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The confidence of reason give;
23202,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And in the light of truth thy bondman let me live!

23205,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,_532._ _The Rainbow_
23206,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23207,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,My heart leaps up when I behold
23208,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A rainbow in the sky:
23209,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,So was it when my life began;
23210,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,So is it now I am a man;
23211,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"So be it when I shall grow old,"
23212,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Or let me die!
23213,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The Child is father of the Man;
23214,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And I could wish my days to be
23215,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Bound each to each by natural piety.

23222,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23223,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room,"
23224,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And hermits are contented with their cells,"
23225,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And students with their pensive citadels;
23226,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,"
23227,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,"
23228,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"High as the highest peak of Furness fells,"
23229,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
23230,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,In truth the prison unto which we doom
23231,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Ourselves no prison is: and hence for me,"
23232,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound"
23233,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Within the Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;
23234,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be)
23235,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,"
23236,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Should find brief solace there, as I have found."

23240,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23241,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frown'd,"
23242,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Mindless of its just honours; with this key
23243,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Shakespeare unlock'd his heart; the melody
23244,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;
23245,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
23246,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,With it Camöens sooth'd an exile's grief;
23247,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The Sonnet glitter'd a gay myrtle leaf
23248,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Amid the cypress with which Dante crown'd
23249,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,"
23250,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"It cheer'd mild Spenser, call'd from Faery-land"
23251,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
23252,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand"
23253,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
23254,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!"

23256,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,_535._ _The World_
23257,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23258,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The world is too much with us; late and soon,"
23259,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:"
23260,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Little we see in Nature that is ours;
23261,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!"
23262,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,This sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
23263,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The winds that will be howling at all hours,"
23264,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And are up-gather’d now like sleeping flowers;
23265,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"For this, for everything, we are out of tune;"
23266,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,It moves us not.--Great God! I’d rather be
23267,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
23268,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,"
23269,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
23270,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
23271,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.

23276,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,_Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood_
23277,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23278,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,"
23279,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The earth, and every common sight,"
23280,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To me did seem
23281,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Apparell’d in celestial light,"
23282,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The glory and the freshness of a dream,"
23283,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
23284,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Turn wheresoe’er I may,"
23285,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"By night or day,"
23286,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
23287,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The rainbow comes and goes,"
23288,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And lovely is the rose;
23289,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The moon doth with delight
23290,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Look round her when the heavens are bare;
23291,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Waters on a starry night
23292,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Are beautiful and fair;
23293,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The sunshine is a glorious birth;
23294,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"But yet I know, where’er I go,"
23295,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,That there hath pass’d away a glory from the earth.
23296,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23297,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,"
23298,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And while the young lambs bound
23299,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"As to the tabor’s sound,"
23300,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To me alone there came a thought of grief:
23301,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A timely utterance gave that thought relief,"
23302,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And I again am strong:
23303,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
23304,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
23305,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,"
23306,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,"
23307,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And all the earth is gay;
23308,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Land and sea
23309,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Give themselves up to jollity,"
23310,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And with the heart of May
23311,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Doth every beast keep holiday;--
23312,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thou Child of Joy,"
23313,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!"
23314,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23315,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Ye blessèd creatures, I have heard the call"
23316,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Ye to each other make; I see
23317,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
23318,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"My heart is at your festival,"
23319,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"My head hath its coronal,"
23320,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The fullness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all."
23321,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,O evil day! if I were sullen
23322,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"While Earth herself is adorning,"
23323,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"This sweet May-morning,"
23324,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And the children are culling
23325,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"On every side,"
23326,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"In a thousand valleys far and wide,"
23327,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,"
23328,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm:--
23329,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!"
23330,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"--But there’s a tree, of many, one,"
23331,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A single field which I have look’d upon,"
23332,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Both of them speak of something that is gone:
23333,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The pansy at my feet
23334,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Doth the same tale repeat:
23335,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
23336,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
23337,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23338,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
23339,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,"
23340,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Hath had elsewhere its setting,"
23341,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And cometh from afar:
23342,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Not in entire forgetfulness,"
23343,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And not in utter nakedness,"
23344,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,But trailing clouds of glory do we come
23345,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"From God, who is our home:"
23346,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
23347,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Shades of the prison-house begin to close
23348,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Upon the growing Boy,"
23349,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,"
23350,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,He sees it in his joy;
23351,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The Youth, who daily farther from the east"
23352,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,"
23353,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And by the vision splendid
23354,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Is on his way attended;
23355,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"At length the Man perceives it die away,"
23356,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And fade into the light of common day.
23357,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23358,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
23359,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,"
23360,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And, even with something of a mother’s mind,"
23361,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And no unworthy aim,"
23362,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The homely nurse doth all she can
23363,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"To make her foster-child, her inmate Man,"
23364,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Forget the glories he hath known,"
23365,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And that imperial palace whence he came.
23366,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23367,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,"
23368,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A six years’ darling of a pigmy size!
23369,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"See, where ’mid work of his own hand he lies,"
23370,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,"
23371,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,With light upon him from his father’s eyes!
23372,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,"
23373,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Some fragment from his dream of human life,"
23374,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Shaped by himself with newly-learnèd art;
23375,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"A wedding or a festival,"
23376,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A mourning or a funeral;
23377,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And this hath now his heart,"
23378,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And unto this he frames his song:
23379,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Then will he fit his tongue
23380,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"To dialogues of business, love, or strife;"
23381,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,But it will not be long
23382,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Ere this be thrown aside,"
23383,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,And with new joy and pride
23384,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The little actor cons another part;
23385,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Filling from time to time his ‘humorous stage’
23386,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,"
23387,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,That Life brings with her in her equipage;
23388,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,As if his whole vocation
23389,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Were endless imitation.
23390,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23391,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie"
23392,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Thy soul’s immensity;
23393,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep"
23394,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind,"
23395,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep,"
23396,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,--"
23397,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Mighty prophet! Seer blest!
23398,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"On whom those truths do rest,"
23399,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Which we are toiling all our lives to find,"
23400,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;"
23401,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thou, over whom thy Immortality"
23402,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Broods like the Day, a master o’er a slave,"
23403,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A presence which is not to be put by;
23404,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To whom the grave
23405,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
23406,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Of day or the warm light,"
23407,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,A place of thought where we in waiting lie;
23408,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might"
23409,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Of heaven-born freedom on thy being’s height,"
23410,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
23411,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"The years to bring the inevitable yoke,"
23412,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
23413,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,"
23414,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And custom lie upon thee with a weight,"
23415,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!"
23416,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,O joy! that in our embers
23417,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Is something that doth live,"
23418,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,That nature yet remembers
23419,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,What was so fugitive!
23420,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The thought of our past years in me doth breed

23437,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Which, be they what they may,"

23441,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
23442,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,"

23469,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,In the primal sympathy
23470,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Which having been must ever be;
23471,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,In the soothing thoughts that spring
23472,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Out of human suffering;
23473,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"In the faith that looks through death,"
23474,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,In years that bring the philosophic mind.
23475,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
23476,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"And O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,"
23477,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Forebode not any severing of our loves!
23478,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
23479,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,I only have relinquished one delight
23480,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To live beneath your more habitual sway.
23481,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"I love the brooks which down their channels fret,"
23482,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Even more than when I tripp’d lightly as they;
23483,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
23484,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Is lovely yet;
23485,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,The clouds that gather round the setting sun
23486,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Do take a sober colouring from an eye
23487,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;
23488,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Another race hath been, and other palms are won."
23489,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thanks to the human heart by which we live,"
23490,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,"
23491,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,To me the meanest flower that blows can give
23492,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

23506,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,"
23507,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,"Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,"
23508,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;

23822,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Firm at his dangerous post he stood;
23823,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Each call for needful rest repell’d,"
23824,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"With dying hand the rudder held,"
23825,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Till in his fall with fateful sway
23826,SIR WALTER SCOTT,The steerage of the realm gave way.
23827,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Then--while on Britain’s thousand plains
23828,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"One unpolluted church remains,"
23829,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Whose peaceful bells ne’er sent around
23830,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"The bloody tocsin’s maddening sound,"
23831,SIR WALTER SCOTT,But still upon the hallow’d day
23832,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Convoke the swains to praise and pray;
23833,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"While faith and civil peace are dear,"
23834,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Grace this cold marble with a tear:--
23835,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"He who preserved them, PITT, lies here!"
23836,SIR WALTER SCOTT,
23837,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Nor yet suppress the generous sigh,"
23838,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Because his rival slumbers nigh;
23839,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Nor be thy _Requiescat_ dumb
23840,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Lest it be said o’er Fox’s tomb.
23841,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"For talents mourn, untimely lost,"
23842,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"When best employ’d, and wanted most;"
23843,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Mourn genius high, and lore profound,"
23844,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"And wit that loved to play, not wound;"
23845,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And all the reasoning powers divine
23846,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"To penetrate, resolve, combine;"
23847,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"And feelings keen, and fancy’s glow--"
23848,SIR WALTER SCOTT,They sleep with him who sleeps below:
23849,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"And, if thou mourn’st they could not save"
23850,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"From error him who owns this grave,"
23851,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Be every harsher thought suppress’d,"
23852,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And sacred be the last long rest.
23853,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"_Here_, where the end of earthly things"
23854,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings;"
23855,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue,"
23856,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung;"
23857,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"_Here_, where the fretted vaults prolong"
23858,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"The distant notes of holy song,"
23859,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"As if some angel spoke agen,"
23860,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"‘All peace on earth, good-will to men’;"
23861,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"If ever from an English heart,"
23862,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"O, _here_ let prejudice depart,"
23863,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"And, partial feeling cast aside,"
23864,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Record that Fox a Briton died!
23865,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"When Europe crouch’d to France’s yoke,"
23866,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"And Austria bent, and Prussia broke,"
23867,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And the firm Russian’s purpose brave
23868,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Was bartered by a timorous slave--
23869,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Even then dishonour’s peace he spurn’d,"
23870,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"The sullied olive-branch return’d,"
23871,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Stood for his country’s glory fast,"
23872,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And nail’d her colours to the mast!
23873,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Heaven, to reward his firmness, gave"
23874,SIR WALTER SCOTT,A portion in this honour’d grave;
23875,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And ne’er held marble in its trust
23876,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Of two such wondrous men the dust.
23877,SIR WALTER SCOTT,
23878,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"With more than mortal powers endow’d,"
23879,SIR WALTER SCOTT,How high they soar’d above the crowd!
23880,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Theirs was no common party race,"
23881,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Jostling by dark intrigue for place;
23882,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Like fabled gods, their mighty war"
23883,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Shook realms and nations in its jar;
23884,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Beneath each banner proud to stand,"
23885,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Look’d up the noblest of the land,"
23886,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Till through the British world were known
23887,SIR WALTER SCOTT,The names of PITT and FOX alone.
23888,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Spells of such force no wizard grave
23889,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"E’er framed in dark Thessalian cave,"
23890,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Though his could drain the ocean dry,"
23891,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And force the planets from the sky.
23892,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"These spells are spent, and, spent with these,"
23893,SIR WALTER SCOTT,The wine of life is on the lees.
23894,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Genius, and taste, and talent gone,"
23895,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"For ever tomb’d beneath the stone,"
23896,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Where--taming thought to human pride!--
23897,SIR WALTER SCOTT,The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.
23898,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"Drop upon Fox’s grave the tear,"
23899,SIR WALTER SCOTT,’Twill trickle to his rival’s bier;
23900,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"O’er PITT’s the mournful requiem sound,"
23901,SIR WALTER SCOTT,And FOX’s shall the notes rebound.
23902,SIR WALTER SCOTT,"The solemn echo seems to cry,"
23903,SIR WALTER SCOTT,‘Here let their discord with them die.
23904,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Speak not for those a separate doom
23905,SIR WALTER SCOTT,Whom fate made Brothers in the tomb;

24360,PART IV,"Her beams bemock’d the sultry main,"

24388,PART IV,And I bless’d them unaware:

24390,PART IV,And I bless’d them unaware.
24391,PART IV,
24392,PART IV,[Sidenote: The spell begins to break.]

24394,PART IV,The selfsame moment I could pray;

24396,PART IV,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"

24405,PART V,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,"
24406,PART V,That slid into my soul.
24407,PART V,
24408,PART V,"[Sidenote: By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed"
24409,PART V,with rain.]
24410,PART V,
24411,PART V,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
24412,PART V,"That had so long remain’d,"
24413,PART V,I dreamt that they were fill’d with dew;
24414,PART V,"And when I awoke, it rain’d."
24415,PART V,
24416,PART V,
24417,PART V,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
24418,PART V,My garments all were dank;
24419,PART V,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
24420,PART V,And still my body drank.
24421,PART V,
24422,PART V,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:"
24423,PART V,I was so light--almost
24424,PART V,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
24425,PART V,And was a blessèd ghost.

24429,PART V,
24430,PART V,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
24431,PART V,It did not come anear;
24432,PART V,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
24433,PART V,That were so thin and sere.
24434,PART V,
24435,PART V,The upper air burst into life;
24436,PART V,And a hundred fire-flags sheen;
24437,PART V,To and fro they were hurried about!
24438,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
24439,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
24440,PART V,
24441,PART V,And the coming wind did roar more loud.
24442,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
24443,PART V,And the rain pour’d down from one black cloud;
24444,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
24445,PART V,
24446,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
24447,PART V,The Moon was at its side;
24448,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
24449,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,"
24450,PART V,A river steep and wide.

24455,PART V,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
24456,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
24457,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
24458,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.
24459,PART V,
24460,PART V,
24461,PART V,"They groan’d, they stirr’d, they all uprose,"
24462,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
24463,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
24464,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
24465,PART V,
24466,PART V,"The helmsman steer’d, the ship moved on;"
24467,PART V,Yet never a breeze up-blew;
24468,PART V,"The mariners all ’gan work the ropes,"
24469,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
24470,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
24471,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.
24472,PART V,
24473,PART V,The body of my brother’s son
24474,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
24475,PART V,"The body and I pull’d at one rope,"
24476,PART V,But he said naught to me.’
24477,PART V,
24478,PART V,"[Sidenote: But not by the souls of the men, nor by demons of earth or"

24482,PART V,"‘I fear thee, ancient Mariner!’"
24483,PART V,"‘Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest:"
24484,PART V,"’Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
24485,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
24486,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
24487,PART V,
24488,PART V,"For when it dawn’d--they dropp’d their arms,"
24489,PART V,And cluster’d round the mast;
24490,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
24491,PART V,And from their bodies pass’d.
24492,PART V,
24493,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
24494,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;
24495,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
24496,PART V,"Now mix’d, now one by one."
24497,PART V,
24498,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
24499,PART V,I heard the skylark sing;
24500,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,"
24501,PART V,How they seem’d to fill the sea and air
24502,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
24503,PART V,
24504,PART V,
24505,PART V,"And now ’twas like all instruments,"
24506,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
24507,PART V,"And now it is an angel’s song,"
24508,PART V,That makes the Heavens be mute.
24509,PART V,
24510,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
24511,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
24512,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
24513,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,"
24514,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
24515,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
24516,PART V,
24517,PART V,"Till noon we quietly sail’d on,"
24518,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
24519,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,"
24520,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
24521,PART V,
24522,PART V,[Sidenote: The lonesome Spirit from the South Pole carries on the ship

24526,PART V,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
24527,PART V,"From the land, of mist and snow,"
24528,PART V,The Spirit slid: and it was he
24529,PART V,That made the ship to go.
24530,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
24531,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
24532,PART V,
24533,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
24534,PART V,Had fix’d her to the ocean:
24535,PART V,"But in a minute she ’gan stir,"
24536,PART V,With a short uneasy motion--
24537,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
24538,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
24539,PART V,
24540,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
24541,PART V,She made a sudden bound:
24542,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
24543,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.
24544,PART V,
24545,PART V,"[Sidenote: The Polar Spirit’s fellow-demons, the invisible inhabitants"

24549,PART V,
24550,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
24551,PART V,I have not to declare;
24552,PART V,"But ere my living life return’d,"
24553,PART V,"I heard, and in my soul discern’d"
24554,PART V,Two voices in the air.

24556,PART V,"“Is it he?” quoth one, “is this the man?"
24557,PART V,"By Him who died on cross,"
24558,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low
24559,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
24560,PART V,
24561,PART V,The Spirit who bideth by himself
24562,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
24563,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
24564,PART V,Who shot him with his bow.”
24565,PART V,
24566,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
24567,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
24568,PART V,"Quoth he, “The man hath penance done,"
24569,PART V,And penance more will do.”

24577,PART VI,Thy soft response renewing--
24578,PART VI,What makes that ship drive on so fast?

24581,PART VI,_Second Voice_:

24583,PART VI,"“Still as a slave before his lord,"

24586,PART VI,Up to the Moon is cast--
24587,PART VI,
24588,PART VI,
24589,PART VI,If he may know which way to go;
24590,PART VI,For she guides him smooth or grim.
24591,PART VI,"See, brother, see! how graciously"
24592,PART VI,She looketh down on him.”
24593,PART VI,
24594,PART VI,[Sidenote: The Mariner hath been cast into a trance; for the angelic

24605,PART VI,"“The air is cut away before,"
24606,PART VI,And closes from behind.
24607,PART VI,
24608,PART VI,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"
24609,PART VI,Or we shall be belated:
24610,PART VI,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
24611,PART VI,When the Mariner’s trance is abated.’
24612,PART VI,
24613,PART VI,"[Sidenote: The super-natural motion is retarded; the Mariner awakes, and"
24614,PART VI,his penance begins anew.]
24615,PART VI,
24616,PART VI,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
24617,PART VI,As in a gentle weather:
24618,PART VI,"’Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;"
24619,PART VI,The dead men stood together.
24620,PART VI,
24621,PART VI,"All stood together on the deck,"
24622,PART VI,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
24623,PART VI,"All fix’d on me their stony eyes,"
24624,PART VI,That in the Moon did glitter.
24625,PART VI,
24626,PART VI,"The pang, the curse, with which they died."
24627,PART VI,Had never pass’d away:
24628,PART VI,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,"
24629,PART VI,Nor turn them up to pray.
24630,PART VI,
24631,PART VI,[Sidenote: The curse is finally expiated.]
24632,PART VI,
24633,PART VI,And now this spell was snapt: once more
24634,PART VI,"I viewed the ocean green,"
24635,PART VI,"And look’d far forth, yet little saw"
24636,PART VI,Of what had else been seen--
24637,PART VI,
24638,PART VI,
24639,PART VI,Like one that on a lonesome road
24640,PART VI,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
24641,PART VI,"And having once turned round, walks on,"
24642,PART VI,And turns no more his head;
24643,PART VI,Because he knows a frightful fiend
24644,PART VI,Doth close behind him tread.
24645,PART VI,
24646,PART VI,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
24647,PART VI,Nor sound nor motion made:
24648,PART VI,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
24649,PART VI,In ripple or in shade.
24650,PART VI,
24651,PART VI,"It raised my hair, it fann’d my cheek"
24652,PART VI,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
24653,PART VI,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
24654,PART VI,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
24655,PART VI,
24656,PART VI,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,"
24657,PART VI,Yet she sail’d softly too:
24658,PART VI,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
24659,PART VI,On me alone it blew.
24660,PART VI,
24661,PART VI,[Sidenote: And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.]
24662,PART VI,
24663,PART VI,O dream of joy! is this indeed
24664,PART VI,The lighthouse top I see?
24665,PART VI,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
24666,PART VI,Is this mine own countree?
24667,PART VI,
24668,PART VI,"We drifted o’er the harbour-bar,"
24669,PART VI,And I with sobs did pray--
24670,PART VI,"O let me be awake, my God!"
24671,PART VI,Or let me sleep alway.
24672,PART VI,
24673,PART VI,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
24674,PART VI,So smoothly it was strewn!
24675,PART VI,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
24676,PART VI,And the shadow of the Moon.
24677,PART VI,
24678,PART VI,
24679,PART VI,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less"
24680,PART VI,That stands above the rock:
24681,PART VI,The moonlight steep’d in silentness
24682,PART VI,The steady weathercock.
24683,PART VI,
24684,PART VI,"[Sidenote: The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,]"
24685,PART VI,
24686,PART VI,And the bay was white with silent light
24687,PART VI,"Till rising from the same,"
24688,PART VI,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
24689,PART VI,In crimson colours came.
24690,PART VI,
24691,PART VI,[Sidenote: And appear in their own forms of light.]
24692,PART VI,
24693,PART VI,A little distance from the prow
24694,PART VI,Those crimson shadows were:
24695,PART VI,I turn’d my eyes upon the deck--
24696,PART VI,O Christ! what saw I there!
24697,PART VI,
24698,PART VI,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
24699,PART VI,"And, by the holy rood!"
24700,PART VI,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
24701,PART VI,On every corse there stood.
24702,PART VI,
24703,PART VI,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
24704,PART VI,It was a heavenly sight!
24705,PART VI,"They stood as signals to the land,"
24706,PART VI,Each one a lovely light;
24707,PART VI,
24708,PART VI,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
24709,PART VI,No voice did they impart--
24710,PART VI,"No voice; but O, the silence sank"
24711,PART VI,Like music on my heart.
24712,PART VI,
24713,PART VI,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
24714,PART VI,I heard the Pilot’s cheer;
24715,PART VI,"My head was turn’d perforce away,"
24716,PART VI,And I saw a boat appear.
24717,PART VI,
24718,PART VI,
24719,PART VI,"The Pilot and the Pilot’s boy,"
24720,PART VI,I heard them coming fast:
24721,PART VI,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
24722,PART VI,The dead men could not blast.
24723,PART VI,
24724,PART VI,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
24725,PART VI,It is the Hermit good!
24726,PART VI,He singeth loud his godly hymns
24727,PART VI,That he makes in the wood.
24728,PART VI,"He’ll shrieve my soul, he’ll wash away"
24729,PART VI,The Albatross’s blood.

24737,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.
24738,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
24739,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
24740,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
24741,PART VII,
24742,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
24743,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump.
24744,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
24745,PART VII,The rotted old oak-stump.
24746,PART VII,
24747,PART VII,"The skiff-boat near’d: I heard them talk,"
24748,PART VII,"“Why, this is strange, I trow!"
24749,PART VII,"Where are those lights so many and fair,"
24750,PART VII,That signal made but now?”
24751,PART VII,
24752,PART VII,[Sidenote: Approacheth the ship with wonder.]
24753,PART VII,
24754,PART VII,"“Strange, by my faith!” the Hermit said--"
24755,PART VII,“And they answer’d not our cheer!
24756,PART VII,"The planks look warp’d! and see those sails,"
24757,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!
24758,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"
24759,PART VII,Unless perchance it were
24760,PART VII,Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
24761,PART VII,My forest-brook along;
24762,PART VII,"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
24763,PART VII,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"

24765,PART VII,
24766,PART VII,“Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--
24767,PART VII,(The Pilot made reply)
24768,PART VII,"I am a-fear’d.”--“Push on, push on!”"
24769,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
24770,PART VII,
24771,PART VII,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
24772,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirr’d;
24773,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
24774,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.
24775,PART VII,
24776,PART VII,[Sidenote: The ship suddenly sinketh.]
24777,PART VII,
24778,PART VII,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
24779,PART VII,Still louder and more dread:
24780,PART VII,"It reach’d the ship, it split the bay;"
24781,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
24782,PART VII,
24783,PART VII,[Sidenote: The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot’s boat.]
24784,PART VII,
24785,PART VII,"Stunn’d by that loud and dreadful sound,"
24786,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
24787,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drown’d
24788,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
24789,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
24790,PART VII,Within the Pilot’s boat.
24791,PART VII,
24792,PART VII,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
24793,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
24794,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
24795,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
24796,PART VII,
24797,PART VII,I moved my lips--the Pilot shriek’d
24798,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
24799,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
24800,PART VII,And pray’d where he did sit.
24801,PART VII,
24802,PART VII,
24803,PART VII,"I took the oars: the Pilot’s boy,"
24804,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,"
24805,PART VII,"Laugh’d loud and long, and all the while"
24806,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
24807,PART VII,"“Ha! ha!” quoth he, “full plain I see"
24808,PART VII,The Devil knows how to row.”
24809,PART VII,
24810,PART VII,"And now, all in my own countree,"
24811,PART VII,I stood on the firm land!
24812,PART VII,"The Hermit stepp’d forth from the boat,"
24813,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
24814,PART VII,
24815,PART VII,[Sidenote: The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to

24817,PART VII,
24818,PART VII,"“O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!”"
24819,PART VII,The Hermit cross’d his brow.

24821,PART VII,What manner of man art thou?”
24822,PART VII,
24823,PART VII,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench’d
24824,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"

24843,PART VII,The wedding-guests are there:
24844,PART VII,But in the garden-bower the bride
24845,PART VII,And bride-maids singing are:
24846,PART VII,"And hark, the little vesper bell,"
24847,PART VII,Which biddeth me to prayer!
24848,PART VII,
24849,PART VII,O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
24850,PART VII,"Alone on a wide, wide sea:"
24851,PART VII,"So lonely ’twas, that God Himself"

24853,PART VII,

24855,PART VII,"’Tis sweeter far to me,"

24857,PART VII,With a goodly company!--
24858,PART VII,
24859,PART VII,"To walk together to the kirk,"
24860,PART VII,"And all together pray,"
24861,PART VII,"While each to his great Father bends,"

24890,PART VII,
24891,PART VII,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
24892,PART VII,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
24893,PART VII,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
24894,PART VII,Through caverns measureless to man
24895,PART VII,Down to a sunless sea.
24896,PART VII,So twice five miles of fertile ground
24897,PART VII,With walls and towers were girdled round:
24898,PART VII,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
24899,PART VII,Where blossom’d many an incense-bearing tree;
24900,PART VII,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
24901,PART VII,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
24902,PART VII,
24903,PART VII,"But O, that deep romantic chasm which slanted"
24904,PART VII,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
24905,PART VII,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
24906,PART VII,As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
24907,PART VII,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
24908,PART VII,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"
24909,PART VII,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
24910,PART VII,A mighty fountain momently was forced;
24911,PART VII,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
24912,PART VII,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
24913,PART VII,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:
24914,PART VII,And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
24915,PART VII,It flung up momently the sacred river.
24916,PART VII,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
24917,PART VII,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
24918,PART VII,"Then reach’d the caverns measureless to man,"
24919,PART VII,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
24920,PART VII,And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
24921,PART VII,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
24922,PART VII,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
24923,PART VII,Floated midway on the waves;
24924,PART VII,Where was heard the mingled measure
24925,PART VII,From the fountain and the caves.
24926,PART VII,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
24927,PART VII,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
24928,PART VII,
24929,PART VII,A damsel with a dulcimer
24930,PART VII,In a vision once I saw:
24931,PART VII,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"
24932,PART VII,"And on her dulcimer she play’d,"
24933,PART VII,Singing of Mount Abora.
24934,PART VII,"Could I revive within me,"
24935,PART VII,"Her symphony and song,"
24936,PART VII,"To such a deep delight ’twould win me,"
24937,PART VII,"That with music loud and long,"
24938,PART VII,"I would build that dome in air,"
24939,PART VII,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
24940,PART VII,"And all who heard should see them there,"
24941,PART VII,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
24942,PART VII,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
24943,PART VII,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
24944,PART VII,"And close your eyes with holy dread,"
24945,PART VII,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"

24960,PART VII,
24961,PART VII,"The moonshine, stealing o’er the scene,"
24962,PART VII,Had blended with the lights of eve;

24964,PART VII,My own dear Genevieve!
24965,PART VII,
24966,PART VII,"She lean’d against the armèd man,"
24967,PART VII,The statue of the armèd Knight;
24968,PART VII,"She stood and listen’d to my lay,"

24973,PART VII,She loves me best whene’er I sing
24974,PART VII,The songs that make her grieve.
24975,PART VII,
24976,PART VII,I play’d a soft and doleful air;
24977,PART VII,I sang an old and moving story--
24978,PART VII,"An old rude song, that suited well"
24979,PART VII,That ruin wild and hoary.
24980,PART VII,
24981,PART VII,"She listen’d with a flitting blush,"
24982,PART VII,With downcast eyes and modest grace;
24983,PART VII,For well she knew I could not choose
24984,PART VII,But gaze upon her face.
24985,PART VII,
24986,PART VII,I told her of the Knight that wore
24987,PART VII,Upon his shield a burning brand;
24988,PART VII,And that for ten long years he woo’d
24989,PART VII,The Lady of the Land.
24990,PART VII,
24991,PART VII,I told her how he pined: and ah!
24992,PART VII,"The deep, the low, the pleading tone"
24993,PART VII,"With which I sang another’s love,"
24994,PART VII,Interpreted my own.
24995,PART VII,
24996,PART VII,"She listened with a flitting blush,"
24997,PART VII,"With downcast eyes, and modest grace;"
24998,PART VII,"And she forgave me, that I gazed"
24999,PART VII,Too fondly on her face!
25000,PART VII,
25001,PART VII,But when I told the cruel scorn
25002,PART VII,"That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,"
25003,PART VII,"And that he cross’d the mountain-woods,"
25004,PART VII,Nor rested day nor night;
25005,PART VII,
25006,PART VII,"That sometimes from the savage den,"
25007,PART VII,"And sometimes from the darksome shade,"
25008,PART VII,And sometimes starting up at once
25009,PART VII,In green and sunny glade--
25010,PART VII,
25011,PART VII,There came and look’d him in the face
25012,PART VII,An angel beautiful and bright;
25013,PART VII,"And that he knew it was a Fiend,"
25014,PART VII,This miserable Knight!
25015,PART VII,
25016,PART VII,"And that, unknowing what he did,"
25017,PART VII,"He leap’d amid a murderous band,"
25018,PART VII,And saved from outrage worse than death
25019,PART VII,The Lady of the Land;--
25020,PART VII,
25021,PART VII,And how she wept and clasp’d his knees;
25022,PART VII,And how she tended him in vain--
25023,PART VII,And ever strove to expiate
25024,PART VII,The scorn that crazed his brain;--
25025,PART VII,
25026,PART VII,And that she nursed him in a cave;
25027,PART VII,"And how his madness went away,"
25028,PART VII,When on the yellow forest leaves
25029,PART VII,A dying man he lay;--
25030,PART VII,
25031,PART VII,His dying words--but when I reach’d
25032,PART VII,"That tenderest strain of all the ditty,"
25033,PART VII,My faltering voice and pausing harp
25034,PART VII,Disturb’d her soul with pity!
25035,PART VII,
25036,PART VII,All impulses of soul and sense
25037,PART VII,Had thrill’d my guileless Genevieve;
25038,PART VII,"The music and the doleful tale,"
25039,PART VII,The rich and balmy eve;
25040,PART VII,
25041,PART VII,"And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,"
25042,PART VII,"An undistinguishable throng,"
25043,PART VII,"And gentle wishes long subdued,"
25044,PART VII,Subdued and cherish’d long!
25045,PART VII,
25046,PART VII,"She wept with pity and delight,"
25047,PART VII,She blush’d with love and virgin shame;
25048,PART VII,"And like the murmur of a dream,"
25049,PART VII,I heard her breathe my name.
25050,PART VII,
25051,PART VII,"Her bosom heaved--she stepp’d aside,"
25052,PART VII,As conscious of my look she stept--
25053,PART VII,"Then suddenly, with timorous eye"
25054,PART VII,She fled to me and wept.
25055,PART VII,
25056,PART VII,"She half enclosed me with her arms,"
25057,PART VII,She press’d me with a meek embrace;
25058,PART VII,"And bending back her head, look’d up,"
25059,PART VII,And gazed upon my face.
25060,PART VII,
25061,PART VII,"’Twas partly love, and partly fear,"
25062,PART VII,"And partly ’twas a bashful art,"
25063,PART VII,"That I might rather feel, than see."
25064,PART VII,The swelling of her heart.
25065,PART VII,
25066,PART VII,"I calm’d her fears, and she was calm,"
25067,PART VII,And told her love with virgin pride;

26677,PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY,And then I changed my pipings--

28491,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"She had a brother, and a tender father,"
28492,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"And she was loved, but not as others are"
28493,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"From whom we ask return of love,--but rather"
28494,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,As one might love a dream; a phantom fair
28495,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Of something exquisitely strange and rare,"
28496,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Which all were glad to look on, men and maids,"
28497,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Yet no one claim’d--as oft, in dewy glades,"
28498,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"The peering primrose, like a sudden gladness,"
28499,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Gleams on the soul, yet unregarded fades;--"
28500,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"The joy is ours, but all its own the sadness."
28501,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,
28502,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,’Tis vain to say--her worst of grief is only
28503,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"The common lot, which all the world have known;"
28504,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"To her ’tis more, because her heart is lonely,"
28505,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"And yet she hath no strength to stand alone,--"
28506,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Once she had playmates, fancies of her own,"
28507,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,And she did love them. They are past away
28508,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,As Fairies vanish at the break of day;
28509,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"And like a spectre of an age departed,"
28510,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Or unsphered Angel wofully astray,"
28511,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,She glides along--the solitary-hearted.

28517,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"As many maidens be,"
28518,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Her loveliness I never knew
28519,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Until she smiled on me;
28520,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"O, then I saw her eye was bright,"
28521,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"A well of love, a spring of light!"
28522,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,
28523,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"But now her looks are coy and cold,"
28524,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"To mine they ne’er reply,"
28525,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,And yet I cease not to behold
28526,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,The love-light in her eye:
28527,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Her very frowns are fairer far
28528,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Than smiles of other maidens are.

28534,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Before the sun was high;
28535,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"So brief her time, she scarcely knew"
28536,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,The meaning of a sigh.
28537,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,
28538,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"As round the rose its soft perfume,"
28539,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Sweet love around her floated;
28540,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Admired she grew--while mortal doom

28542,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,
28543,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Love was her guardian Angel here,"

28552,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,The need of human love we little noted:
28553,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Our love was nature; and the peace that floated
28554,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"On the white mist, and dwelt upon the hills,"
28555,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,To sweet accord subdued our wayward wills:
28556,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"One soul was ours, one mind, one heart devoted,"
28557,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"That, wisely doting, ask’d not why it doted,"
28558,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"And ours the unknown joy, which knowing kills."
28559,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,But now I find how dear thou wert to me;
28560,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"That man is more than half of nature’s treasure,"
28561,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,"Of that fair beauty which no eye can see,"
28562,HARTLEY COLERIDGE,Of that sweet music which no ear can measure;

28575,THOMAS HOOD,
28576,THOMAS HOOD,I saw old Autumn in the misty morn
28577,THOMAS HOOD,"Stand shadowless like Silence, listening"
28578,THOMAS HOOD,"To silence, for no lonely bird would sing"
28579,THOMAS HOOD,"Into his hollow ear from woods forlorn,"
28580,THOMAS HOOD,Nor lowly hedge nor solitary thorn;--
28581,THOMAS HOOD,Shaking his languid locks all dewy bright
28582,THOMAS HOOD,"With tangled gossamer that fell by night,"
28583,THOMAS HOOD,Pearling his coronet of golden corn.
28584,THOMAS HOOD,
28585,THOMAS HOOD,"Where are the songs of Summer?--With the sun,"
28586,THOMAS HOOD,"Oping the dusky eyelids of the south,"
28587,THOMAS HOOD,"Till shade and silence waken up as one,"
28588,THOMAS HOOD,And Morning sings with a warm odorous mouth.
28589,THOMAS HOOD,"Where are the merry birds?--Away, away,"
28590,THOMAS HOOD,"On panting wings through the inclement skies,"
28591,THOMAS HOOD,Lest owls should prey
28592,THOMAS HOOD,"Undazzled at noonday,"
28593,THOMAS HOOD,And tear with horny beak their lustrous eyes.
28594,THOMAS HOOD,
28595,THOMAS HOOD,"Where are the blooms of Summer?--In the west,"
28596,THOMAS HOOD,"Blushing their last to the last sunny hours,"
28597,THOMAS HOOD,When the mild Eve by sudden Night is prest
28598,THOMAS HOOD,"Like tearful Proserpine, snatch’d from her flow’rs"
28599,THOMAS HOOD,To a most gloomy breast.
28600,THOMAS HOOD,"Where is the pride of Summer,--the green prime,--"
28601,THOMAS HOOD,"The many, many leaves all twinkling?--Three"
28602,THOMAS HOOD,On the moss’d elm; three on the naked lime
28603,THOMAS HOOD,"Trembling,--and one upon the old oak-tree!"
28604,THOMAS HOOD,Where is the Dryad’s immortality?--
28605,THOMAS HOOD,"Gone into mournful cypress and dark yew,"
28606,THOMAS HOOD,Or wearing the long gloomy Winter through
28607,THOMAS HOOD,In the smooth holly’s green eternity.
28608,THOMAS HOOD,
28609,THOMAS HOOD,
28610,THOMAS HOOD,"The squirrel gloats on his accomplished hoard,"
28611,THOMAS HOOD,"The ants have brimm’d their garners with ripe grain,"
28612,THOMAS HOOD,And honey bees have stored
28613,THOMAS HOOD,The sweets of Summer in their luscious cells;
28614,THOMAS HOOD,The swallows all have wing’d across the main;
28615,THOMAS HOOD,"But here the Autumn melancholy dwells,"
28616,THOMAS HOOD,And sighs her tearful spells
28617,THOMAS HOOD,Amongst the sunless shadows of the plain.
28618,THOMAS HOOD,"Alone, alone,"
28619,THOMAS HOOD,"Upon a mossy stone,"
28620,THOMAS HOOD,She sits and reckons up the dead and gone
28621,THOMAS HOOD,"With the last leaves for a love-rosary,"
28622,THOMAS HOOD,"Whilst all the wither’d world looks drearily,"
28623,THOMAS HOOD,Like a dim picture of the drownèd past
28624,THOMAS HOOD,"In the hush’d mind’s mysterious far away,"
28625,THOMAS HOOD,Doubtful what ghostly thing will steal the last
28626,THOMAS HOOD,"Into that distance, gray upon the gray."
28627,THOMAS HOOD,
28628,THOMAS HOOD,"O go and sit with her, and be o’ershaded"
28629,THOMAS HOOD,Under the languid downfall of her hair:
28630,THOMAS HOOD,She wears a coronal of flowers faded
28631,THOMAS HOOD,"Upon her forehead, and a face of care;--"
28632,THOMAS HOOD,There is enough of wither’d everywhere
28633,THOMAS HOOD,"To make her bower,--and enough of gloom;"
28634,THOMAS HOOD,"There is enough of sadness to invite,"
28635,THOMAS HOOD,"If only for the rose that died, whose doom"
28636,THOMAS HOOD,"Is Beauty’s,--she that with the living bloom"
28637,THOMAS HOOD,Of conscious cheeks most beautifies the light:
28638,THOMAS HOOD,"There is enough of sorrowing, and quite"
28639,THOMAS HOOD,"Enough of bitter fruits the earth doth bear,--"
28640,THOMAS HOOD,Enough of chilly droppings for her bowl;
28641,THOMAS HOOD,"Enough of fear and shadowy despair,"
28642,THOMAS HOOD,To frame her cloudy prison for the soul!

28647,THOMAS HOOD,"There is a silence where hath been no sound,"
28648,THOMAS HOOD,"There is a silence where no sound may be,"
28649,THOMAS HOOD,"In the cold grave--under the deep, deep sea,"
28650,THOMAS HOOD,"Or in wide desert where no life is found,"
28651,THOMAS HOOD,"Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound;"
28652,THOMAS HOOD,"No voice is hush’d--no life treads silently,"
28653,THOMAS HOOD,"But clouds and cloudy shadows wander free,"
28654,THOMAS HOOD,"That never spoke, over the idle ground:"
28655,THOMAS HOOD,"But in green ruins, in the desolate walls"
28656,THOMAS HOOD,"Of antique palaces, where Man hath been,"
28657,THOMAS HOOD,"Though the dun fox or wild hyæna calls,"
28658,THOMAS HOOD,"And owls, that flit continually between,"
28659,THOMAS HOOD,"Shriek to the echo, and the low winds moan--"

28666,THOMAS HOOD,This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight;
28667,THOMAS HOOD,"That sometime these bright stars, that now reply"
28668,THOMAS HOOD,"In sunlight to the sun, shall set in night;"
28669,THOMAS HOOD,"That this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite,"
28670,THOMAS HOOD,And all life’s ruddy springs forget to flow;
28671,THOMAS HOOD,"That thoughts shall cease, and the immortal sprite"
28672,THOMAS HOOD,Be lapp’d in alien clay and laid below;
28673,THOMAS HOOD,It is not death to know this--but to know
28674,THOMAS HOOD,"That pious thoughts, which visit at new graves"
28675,THOMAS HOOD,"In tender pilgrimage, will cease to go"
28676,THOMAS HOOD,So duly and so oft--and when grass waves

28678,THOMAS HOOD,No resurrection in the minds of men.

28684,THOMAS HOOD,"She’s gone into the West,"
28685,THOMAS HOOD,"To dazzle when the sun is down,"
28686,THOMAS HOOD,And rob the world of rest:
28687,THOMAS HOOD,"She took our daylight with her,"
28688,THOMAS HOOD,"The smiles that we love best,"
28689,THOMAS HOOD,"With morning blushes on her cheek,"
28690,THOMAS HOOD,And pearls upon her breast.
28691,THOMAS HOOD,
28692,THOMAS HOOD,"O turn again, fair Ines,"
28693,THOMAS HOOD,"Before the fall of night,"
28694,THOMAS HOOD,"For fear the Moon should shine alone,"
28695,THOMAS HOOD,And stars unrivall’d bright;
28696,THOMAS HOOD,And blessèd will the lover be
28697,THOMAS HOOD,"That walks beneath their light,"
28698,THOMAS HOOD,And breathes the love against thy cheek
28699,THOMAS HOOD,I dare not even write!
28700,THOMAS HOOD,
28701,THOMAS HOOD,"Would I had been, fair Ines,"
28702,THOMAS HOOD,"That gallant cavalier,"
28703,THOMAS HOOD,"Who rode so gaily by thy side,"
28704,THOMAS HOOD,And whisper’d thee so near!
28705,THOMAS HOOD,"Were there no bonny dames at home,"
28706,THOMAS HOOD,"Or no true lovers here,"
28707,THOMAS HOOD,That he should cross the seas to win
28708,THOMAS HOOD,The dearest of the dear?
28709,THOMAS HOOD,
28710,THOMAS HOOD,"I saw thee, lovely Ines,"
28711,THOMAS HOOD,"Descend along the shore,"
28712,THOMAS HOOD,"With bands of noble gentlemen,"
28713,THOMAS HOOD,And banners waved before;
28714,THOMAS HOOD,"And gentle youth and maidens gay,"
28715,THOMAS HOOD,And snowy plumes they wore:
28716,THOMAS HOOD,"It would have been a beauteous dream,--"
28717,THOMAS HOOD,If it had been no more!
28718,THOMAS HOOD,
28719,THOMAS HOOD,"Alas, alas! fair Ines,"
28720,THOMAS HOOD,"She went away with song,"
28721,THOMAS HOOD,"With Music waiting on her steps,"
28722,THOMAS HOOD,And shoutings of the throng;
28723,THOMAS HOOD,"But some were sad, and felt no mirth,"
28724,THOMAS HOOD,"But only Music’s wrong,"
28725,THOMAS HOOD,"In sounds that sang Farewell, farewell,"
28726,THOMAS HOOD,To her you’ve loved so long.
28727,THOMAS HOOD,
28728,THOMAS HOOD,"Farewell, farewell, fair Ines!"
28729,THOMAS HOOD,That vessel never bore
28730,THOMAS HOOD,"So fair a lady on its deck,"
28731,THOMAS HOOD,"Nor danced so light before,--"
28732,THOMAS HOOD,"Alas for pleasure on the sea,"

28741,THOMAS HOOD,Our loving lot was cast;
28742,THOMAS HOOD,It was the time of roses--
28743,THOMAS HOOD,We pluck’d them as we pass’d!
28744,THOMAS HOOD,
28745,THOMAS HOOD,That churlish season never frown’d
28746,THOMAS HOOD,On early lovers yet:
28747,THOMAS HOOD,O no--the world was newly crown’d
28748,THOMAS HOOD,With flowers when first we met!
28749,THOMAS HOOD,
28750,THOMAS HOOD,
28751,THOMAS HOOD,"’Twas twilight, and I bade you go,"

28758,THOMAS HOOD,
28759,THOMAS HOOD,"She stood breast-high amid the corn,"

28762,THOMAS HOOD,Who many a glowing kiss had won.
28763,THOMAS HOOD,
28764,THOMAS HOOD,"On her cheek an autumn flush,"
28765,THOMAS HOOD,Deeply ripen’d;--such a blush
28766,THOMAS HOOD,"In the midst of brown was born,"
28767,THOMAS HOOD,Like red poppies grown with corn.
28768,THOMAS HOOD,
28769,THOMAS HOOD,"Round her eyes her tresses fell,"
28770,THOMAS HOOD,"Which were blackest none could tell,"
28771,THOMAS HOOD,"But long lashes veiled a light,"
28772,THOMAS HOOD,That had else been all too bright.
28773,THOMAS HOOD,
28774,THOMAS HOOD,"And her hat, with shady brim,"
28775,THOMAS HOOD,Made her tressy forehead dim;
28776,THOMAS HOOD,"Thus she stood amid the stooks,"
28777,THOMAS HOOD,Praising God with sweetest looks:--
28778,THOMAS HOOD,
28779,THOMAS HOOD,"Sure, I said, Heav’n did not mean,"
28780,THOMAS HOOD,"Where I reap thou shouldst but glean,"
28781,THOMAS HOOD,"Lay thy sheaf adown and come,"

28791,THOMAS HOOD,
28792,THOMAS HOOD,"So silently we seem’d to speak,"
28793,THOMAS HOOD,"So slowly moved about,"
28794,THOMAS HOOD,As we had lent her half our powers
28795,THOMAS HOOD,To eke her living out.
28796,THOMAS HOOD,
28797,THOMAS HOOD,"Our very hopes belied our fears,"
28798,THOMAS HOOD,Our fears our hopes belied--
28799,THOMAS HOOD,"We thought her dying when she slept,"
28800,THOMAS HOOD,And sleeping when she died.
28801,THOMAS HOOD,
28802,THOMAS HOOD,"For when the morn came dim and sad,"

28819,THOMAS HOOD,
28820,THOMAS HOOD,
28821,THOMAS HOOD,Look at her garments

28825,THOMAS HOOD,"Take her up instantly,"

28827,THOMAS HOOD,
28828,THOMAS HOOD,Touch her not scornfully;

28834,THOMAS HOOD,
28835,THOMAS HOOD,Make no deep scrutiny

28837,THOMAS HOOD,Rash and undutiful:
28838,THOMAS HOOD,"Past all dishonour,"

28840,THOMAS HOOD,Only the beautiful.
28841,THOMAS HOOD,
28842,THOMAS HOOD,"Still, for all slips of hers,"
28843,THOMAS HOOD,One of Eve’s family--
28844,THOMAS HOOD,Wipe those poor lips of hers
28845,THOMAS HOOD,Oozing so clammily.
28846,THOMAS HOOD,
28847,THOMAS HOOD,Loop up her tresses
28848,THOMAS HOOD,"Escaped from the comb,"
28849,THOMAS HOOD,Her fair auburn tresses;
28850,THOMAS HOOD,Whilst wonderment guesses
28851,THOMAS HOOD,Where was her home?
28852,THOMAS HOOD,
28853,THOMAS HOOD,Who was her father?
28854,THOMAS HOOD,Who was her mother?
28855,THOMAS HOOD,Had she a sister?

28882,THOMAS HOOD,Houseless by night.
28883,THOMAS HOOD,
28884,THOMAS HOOD,The bleak wind of March

30070,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"When all the garden flowers were trim,"
30071,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,The grave old gardener prided him
30072,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,On these the most of all.
30073,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30074,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Some Lady, stately overmuch,"
30075,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Here moving with a silken noise,"
30076,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Has blush’d beside them at the voice
30077,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,That liken’d her to such.
30078,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30079,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Or these, to make a diadem,"
30080,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,She often may have pluck’d and twined;
30081,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Half-smiling as it came to mind,"
30082,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,That few would look at _them_.
30083,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30084,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"O, little thought that Lady proud,"
30085,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"A child would watch her fair white rose,"
30086,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"When buried lay her whiter brows,"
30087,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,And silk was changed for shroud!--
30088,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30089,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Nor thought that gardener (full of scorns
30090,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,For men unlearn’d and simple phrase)
30091,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"A child would bring it all its praise,"
30092,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,By creeping through the thorns!
30093,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30094,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"To me upon my low moss seat,"
30095,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Though never a dream the roses sent
30096,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Of science or love’s compliment,"
30097,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,I ween they smelt as sweet.
30098,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30099,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,It did not move my grief to see
30100,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,The trace of human step departed:
30101,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Because the garden was deserted,"
30102,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,The blither place for me!
30103,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30104,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken"
30105,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Hath childhood ’twixt the sun and sward;
30106,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,We draw the moral afterward--
30107,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,We feel the gladness then.
30108,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30109,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,And gladdest hours for me did glide
30110,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,In silence at the rose-tree wall:
30111,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,A thrush made gladness musical
30112,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Upon the other side.
30113,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30114,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Nor he nor I did e’er incline
30115,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,To peck or pluck the blossoms white:--
30116,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,How should I know but that they might
30117,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Lead lives as glad as mine?
30118,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30119,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"To make my hermit-home complete,"
30120,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,I brought clear water from the spring
30121,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Praised in its own low murmuring,"
30122,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,And cresses glossy wet.
30123,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30124,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"And so, I thought, my likeness grew"
30125,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,(Without the melancholy tale)
30126,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"To ‘gentle hermit of the dale,’"
30127,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,And Angelina too.
30128,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30129,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,For oft I read within my nook
30130,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
30131,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Made sounds poetic in the trees,"
30132,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,And then I shut the book.
30133,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30134,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"If I shut this wherein I write,"
30135,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,I hear no more the wind athwart
30136,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Those trees, nor feel that childish heart"
30137,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Delighting in delight.
30138,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30139,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"My childhood from my life is parted,"
30140,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,My footstep from the moss which drew
30141,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Its fairy circle round: anew
30142,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,The garden is deserted.
30143,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30144,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Another thrush may there rehearse
30145,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,The madrigals which sweetest are;
30146,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,No more for me!--myself afar
30147,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Do sing a sadder verse.
30148,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30149,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Ah me! ah me! when erst I lay
30150,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"In that child’s-nest so greenly wrought,"
30151,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"I laugh’d unto myself and thought,"
30152,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,‘The time will pass away.’
30153,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30154,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"And still I laugh’d, and did not fear"
30155,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"But that, whene’er was pass’d away"
30156,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"The childish time, some happier play"
30157,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,My womanhood would cheer.
30158,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30159,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,I knew the time would pass away;
30160,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"And yet, beside the rose-tree wall,"
30161,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Dear God, how seldom, if at all,"
30162,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Did I look up to pray!
30163,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30164,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,The time is past: and now that grows
30165,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"The cypress high among the trees,"
30166,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,And I behold white sepulchres
30167,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"As well as the white rose,--"
30168,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30169,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"When wiser, meeker thoughts are given,"
30170,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"And I have learnt to lift my face,"
30171,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Reminded how earth’s greenest place
30172,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"The colour draws from heaven,--"
30173,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,
30174,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"It something saith for earthly pain,"
30175,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"But more for heavenly promise free,"
30176,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"That I who was, would shrink to be"
30177,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,That happy child again.

30187,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"No love in all this world for comforting,"

30189,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Where ‘dust to dust’ the love from life disjoin’d,"
30190,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"And if, before those sepulchres unmoving"
30191,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,I stood alone (as some forsaken lamb

30193,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Crying ‘Where are ye, O my loved and loving?’--"

30203,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
30204,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness
30205,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,In souls as countries lieth silent-bare
30206,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare"
30207,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Of the absolute Heavens. Deep-hearted man, express"

30228,ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING,"Those of my own life, who by turns had flung"

30419,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"I remember the black wharves and the slips,"
30420,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the sea-tides tossing free;
30421,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And Spanish sailors with bearded lips,"
30422,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the beauty and mystery of the ships,"
30423,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the magic of the sea.
30424,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the voice of that wayward song
30425,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Is singing and saying still:
30426,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30427,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30428,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30429,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30430,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"I remember the bulwarks by the shore,"
30431,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the fort upon the hill;
30432,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"The sunrise gun with its hollow roar,"
30433,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"The drum-beat repeated o’er and o’er,"
30434,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the bugle wild and shrill.
30435,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the music of that old song
30436,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Throbs in my memory still:
30437,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30438,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30439,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30440,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"I remember the sea-fight far away,"
30441,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,How it thunder’d o’er the tide!
30442,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the dead sea-captains, as they lay"
30443,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,In their graves o’erlooking the tranquil bay
30444,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Where they in battle died.
30445,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the sound of that mournful song
30446,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Goes through me with a thrill:
30447,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30448,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30449,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30450,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"I can see the breezy dome of groves,"
30451,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,The shadows of Deering’s woods;
30452,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the friendships old and the early loves
30453,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"Come back with a Sabbath sound, as of doves"
30454,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,In quiet neighbourhoods.
30455,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the verse of that sweet old song,"
30456,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,It flutters and murmurs still:
30457,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30458,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30459,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30460,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,I remember the gleams and glooms that dart
30461,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Across the schoolboy’s brain;
30462,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"The song and the silence in the heart,"
30463,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"That in part are prophecies, and in part"
30464,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Are longings wild and vain.
30465,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the voice of that fitful song
30466,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"Sings on, and is never still:"
30467,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30468,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30469,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30470,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,There are things of which I may not speak;
30471,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,There are dreams that cannot die;
30472,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,"
30473,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And bring a pallor into the cheek,"
30474,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And a mist before the eye.
30475,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And the words of that fatal song
30476,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Come over me like a chill:
30477,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30478,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30479,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30480,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Strange to me now are the forms I meet
30481,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,When I visit the dear old town;
30482,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"But the native air is pure and sweet,"
30483,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the trees that o’ershadow each well-known street,"
30484,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"As they balance up and down,"
30485,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"Are singing the beautiful song,"
30486,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,Are sighing and whispering still:
30487,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
30488,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’"
30489,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,
30490,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And Deering’s woods are fresh and fair,"
30491,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And with joy that is almost pain
30492,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"My heart goes back to wander there,"
30493,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,And among the dreams of the days that were
30494,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,I find my lost youth again.
30495,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"And the strange and beautiful song,"
30496,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,The groves are repeating it still:
30497,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW,"‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"

30714,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And this maiden she lived with no other thought

30716,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30717,EDGAR ALLAN POE,I was a child and she was a child
30718,EDGAR ALLAN POE,In this kingdom by the sea:

30721,EDGAR ALLAN POE,With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven
30722,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Coveted her and me.

30729,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And bore her away from me,"
30730,EDGAR ALLAN POE,To shut her up in a sepulchre
30731,EDGAR ALLAN POE,In this kingdom by the sea.
30732,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30733,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"The angels, not half so happy in heaven,"
30734,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Went envying her and me--

30737,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"That the wind came out of the cloud one night,"
30738,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
30739,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30740,EDGAR ALLAN POE,But our love it was stronger by far than the love
30741,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of those who were older than we--
30742,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of many far wiser than we--
30743,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And neither the angels in heaven above,"

30758,EDGAR ALLAN POE,_696._ _For Annie_
30759,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30760,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Thank Heaven! the crisis--
30761,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"The danger is past,"
30762,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And the lingering illness
30763,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Is over at last--
30764,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And the fever called ‘Living’
30765,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Is conquer’d at last.
30766,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30767,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Sadly, I know"
30768,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"I am shorn of my strength,"
30769,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And no muscle I move
30770,EDGAR ALLAN POE,As I lie at full length:
30771,EDGAR ALLAN POE,But no matter--I feel
30772,EDGAR ALLAN POE,I am better at length.
30773,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30774,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And I rest so composedly
30775,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Now, in my bed,"
30776,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That any beholder
30777,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Might fancy me dead--
30778,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Might start at beholding me,"
30779,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Thinking me dead.
30780,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30781,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"The moaning and groaning,"
30782,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"The sighing and sobbing,"
30783,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Are quieted now,"
30784,EDGAR ALLAN POE,With that horrible throbbing
30785,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"At heart--ah, that horrible,"
30786,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Horrible throbbing!
30787,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30788,EDGAR ALLAN POE,The sickness--the nausea--
30789,EDGAR ALLAN POE,The pitiless pain--
30790,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Have ceased, with the fever"
30791,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That madden’d my brain--
30792,EDGAR ALLAN POE,With the fever called ‘Living’
30793,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That burn’d in my brain.
30794,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30795,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And O! of all tortures
30796,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That torture the worst
30797,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Has abated--the terrible
30798,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Torture of thirst
30799,EDGAR ALLAN POE,For the naphthaline river
30800,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of Passion accurst--
30801,EDGAR ALLAN POE,I have drunk of a water
30802,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That quenches all thirst.
30803,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30804,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"--Of a water that flows,"
30805,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"With a lullaby sound,"
30806,EDGAR ALLAN POE,From a spring but a very few
30807,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Feet under ground--
30808,EDGAR ALLAN POE,From a cavern not very far
30809,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Down under ground.
30810,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30811,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And ah! let it never
30812,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Be foolishly said
30813,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"That my room it is gloomy,"
30814,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And narrow my bed;
30815,EDGAR ALLAN POE,For man never slept
30816,EDGAR ALLAN POE,In a different bed--
30817,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And, to _sleep_, you must slumber"
30818,EDGAR ALLAN POE,In just such a bed.
30819,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30820,EDGAR ALLAN POE,My tantalized spirit
30821,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Here blandly reposes,"
30822,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Forgetting, or never"
30823,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Regretting its roses--
30824,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Its old agitations
30825,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of myrtles and roses:
30826,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30827,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"For now, while so quietly"
30828,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Lying, it fancies"
30829,EDGAR ALLAN POE,A holier odour
30830,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"About it, of pansies--"
30831,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"A rosemary odour,"
30832,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Commingled with pansies--
30833,EDGAR ALLAN POE,With rue and the beautiful
30834,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Puritan pansies.
30835,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30836,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And so it lies happily,"
30837,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Bathing in many
30838,EDGAR ALLAN POE,A dream of the truth
30839,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And the beauty of Annie--
30840,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Drown’d in a bath
30841,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of the tresses of Annie.
30842,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30843,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"She tenderly kiss’d me,"
30844,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"She fondly caress’d,"
30845,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And then I fell gently
30846,EDGAR ALLAN POE,To sleep on her breast--
30847,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Deeply to sleep
30848,EDGAR ALLAN POE,From the heaven of her breast.
30849,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30850,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"When the light was extinguish’d,"
30851,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"She cover’d me warm,"
30852,EDGAR ALLAN POE,And she pray’d to the angels
30853,EDGAR ALLAN POE,To keep me from harm--
30854,EDGAR ALLAN POE,To the queen of the angels
30855,EDGAR ALLAN POE,To shield me from harm.
30856,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30857,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And I lie so composedly,"
30858,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Now, in my bed"
30859,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"(Knowing her love),"
30860,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That you fancy me dead--
30861,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"And I rest so contentedly,"
30862,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Now, in my bed"
30863,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"(With her love at my breast),"
30864,EDGAR ALLAN POE,That you fancy me dead--
30865,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"That you shudder to look at me,"
30866,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Thinking me dead.
30867,EDGAR ALLAN POE,
30868,EDGAR ALLAN POE,But my heart it is brighter
30869,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Than all of the many
30870,EDGAR ALLAN POE,"Stars in the sky,"
30871,EDGAR ALLAN POE,For it sparkles with Annie--
30872,EDGAR ALLAN POE,It glows with the light
30873,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of the love of my Annie--
30874,EDGAR ALLAN POE,With the thought of the light
30875,EDGAR ALLAN POE,Of the eyes of my Annie.

30886,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30887,EDWARD FITZGERALD,’Tis a dull sight
30888,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"To see the year dying,"
30889,EDWARD FITZGERALD,When winter winds
30890,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Set the yellow wood sighing:
30891,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Sighing, O sighing!"
30892,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30893,EDWARD FITZGERALD,When such a time cometh
30894,EDWARD FITZGERALD,I do retire
30895,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Into an old room
30896,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Beside a bright fire:
30897,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"O, pile a bright fire!"
30898,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30899,EDWARD FITZGERALD,And there I sit
30900,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Reading old things,"
30901,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Of knights and lorn damsels,"
30902,EDWARD FITZGERALD,While the wind sings--
30903,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"O, drearily sings!"
30904,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30905,EDWARD FITZGERALD,I never look out
30906,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Nor attend to the blast;
30907,EDWARD FITZGERALD,For all to be seen
30908,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Is the leaves falling fast:
30909,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Falling, falling!"
30910,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30911,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"But close at the hearth,"
30912,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Like a cricket, sit I,"
30913,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Reading of summer
30914,EDWARD FITZGERALD,And chivalry--
30915,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Gallant chivalry!
30916,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30917,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Then with an old friend
30918,EDWARD FITZGERALD,I talk of our youth--
30919,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"How ’twas gladsome, but often"
30920,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Foolish, forsooth:"
30921,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"But gladsome, gladsome!"
30922,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30923,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Or, to get merry,"
30924,EDWARD FITZGERALD,We sing some old rhyme
30925,EDWARD FITZGERALD,That made the wood ring again
30926,EDWARD FITZGERALD,In summer time--
30927,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Sweet summer time!
30928,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30929,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Then go we smoking,"
30930,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Silent and snug:
30931,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Naught passes between us,"
30932,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Save a brown jug--
30933,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Sometimes!
30934,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30935,EDWARD FITZGERALD,And sometimes a tear
30936,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Will rise in each eye,"
30937,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Seeing the two old friends
30938,EDWARD FITZGERALD,So merrily--
30939,EDWARD FITZGERALD,So merrily!
30940,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30941,EDWARD FITZGERALD,And ere to bed
30942,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Go we, go we,"
30943,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Down on the ashes
30944,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"We kneel on the knee,"
30945,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Praying together!
30946,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30947,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Thus, then, live I"
30948,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Till, ’mid all the gloom,"
30949,EDWARD FITZGERALD,By Heaven! the bold sun
30950,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Is with me in the room
30951,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Shining, shining!"
30952,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30953,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Then the clouds part,"
30954,EDWARD FITZGERALD,Swallows soaring between;
30955,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"The spring is alive,"
30956,EDWARD FITZGERALD,And the meadows are green!
30957,EDWARD FITZGERALD,
30958,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"I jump up like mad,"
30959,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"Break the old pipe in twain,"
30960,EDWARD FITZGERALD,"And away to the meadows,"
30961,EDWARD FITZGERALD,The meadows again!

30975,I,Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come;

30978,I,

30995,II,"Abode his destined Hour, and went his way."
30996,II,
30997,II,They say the Lion and the Lizard keep

31001,II,
31002,II,I sometimes think that never blows so red
31003,II,The Rose as where some buried Cæsar bled;
31004,II,That every Hyacinth the Garden wears
31005,II,Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.
31006,II,
31007,II,And this reviving Herb whose tender Green
31008,II,Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean--
31009,II,"Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows"
31010,II,From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!
31011,II,
31012,II,"Ah, my Belovèd, fill the Cup that clears"
31013,II,TO-DAY of past Regrets and Future Fears:

31019,II,"Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,"
31020,II,And one by one crept silently to rest.
31021,II,
31022,II,"And we, that now make merry in the Room"
31023,II,"They left, and Summer dresses in new bloom,"
31024,II,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth
31025,II,Descend--ourselves to make a Couch--for whom?
31026,II,
31027,II,"Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,"
31028,II,Before we too into the Dust descend;

31039,III,
31040,III,Yon rising Moon that looks for us again--
31041,III,How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;

31324,PART IV,The Lady of Shalott.
31325,PART IV,
31326,PART IV,"Heard a carol, mournful, holy,"

31504,PART IV,"Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands,"
31505,PART IV,"Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands."
31506,PART IV,"But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song"
31507,PART IV,"Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,"
31508,PART IV,Like a tale of little meaning tho’ the words are strong;
31509,PART IV,"Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,"

32012,XII,To the dancers dancing in tune;
32013,XII,"Till a silence fell with the waking bird,"
32014,XII,And a hush with the setting moon.
32015,XII,
32016,XII,"I said to the lily, ‘There is but one"

32023,XII,The last wheel echoes away.

32033,XII,
32034,XII,"And the soul of the rose went into my blood,"
32035,XII,As the music clash’d in the hall;
32036,XII,"And long by the garden lake I stood,"
32037,XII,For I heard your rivulet fall

32039,XII,"Our wood, that is dearer than all;"
32040,XII,
32041,XII,From the meadow your walks have left so sweet

32043,XII,He sets the jewel-print of your feet
32044,XII,"In violets blue as your eyes,"
32045,XII,To the woody hollows in which we meet
32046,XII,And the valleys of Paradise.
32047,XII,
32048,XII,The slender acacia would not shake
32049,XII,One long milk-bloom on the tree;
32050,XII,"The white lake-blossom fell into the lake,"

32052,XII,"But the rose was awake all night for your sake,"
32053,XII,Knowing your promise to me;
32054,XII,"The lilies and roses were all awake,"
32055,XII,They sigh’d for the dawn and thee.
32056,XII,

32063,XII,
32064,XII,
32065,XII,There has fallen a splendid tear
32066,XII,From the passion-flower at the gate.
32067,XII,"She is coming, my dove, my dear;"
32068,XII,"She is coming, my life, my fate;"
32069,XII,"The red rose cries, ‘She is near, she is near;’"
32070,XII,"And the white rose weeps, ‘She is late,’"
32071,XII,"The larkspur listens, ‘I hear, I hear;’"
32072,XII,"And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.’"
32073,XII,

32404,ROBERT BROWNING,From seeds of April’s sowing.
32405,ROBERT BROWNING,
32406,ROBERT BROWNING,I plant a heartful now: some seed
32407,ROBERT BROWNING,"At least is sure to strike,"

32421,ROBERT BROWNING,"It tore the elm-tops down for spite,"
32422,ROBERT BROWNING,And did its worst to vex the lake:
32423,ROBERT BROWNING,I listen’d with heart fit to break.
32424,ROBERT BROWNING,When glided in Porphyria; straight
32425,ROBERT BROWNING,"She shut the cold out and the storm,"
32426,ROBERT BROWNING,And kneel’d and made the cheerless grate
32427,ROBERT BROWNING,"Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;"
32428,ROBERT BROWNING,"Which done, she rose, and from her form"
32429,ROBERT BROWNING,"Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,"
32430,ROBERT BROWNING,"And laid her soil’d gloves by, untied"
32431,ROBERT BROWNING,"Her hat and let the damp hair fall,"
32432,ROBERT BROWNING,"And, last, she sat down by my side"
32433,ROBERT BROWNING,"And call’d me. When no voice replied,"
32434,ROBERT BROWNING,"She put my arm about her waist,"
32435,ROBERT BROWNING,"And made her smooth white shoulder bare,"
32436,ROBERT BROWNING,"And all her yellow hair displaced,"
32437,ROBERT BROWNING,"And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,"
32438,ROBERT BROWNING,"And spread, o’er all, her yellow hair,"
32439,ROBERT BROWNING,Murmuring how she loved me--she
32440,ROBERT BROWNING,"Too weak, for all her heart’s endeavour,"
32441,ROBERT BROWNING,To set its struggling passion free
32442,ROBERT BROWNING,"From pride, and vainer ties dissever,"
32443,ROBERT BROWNING,And give herself to me for ever.
32444,ROBERT BROWNING,"But passion sometimes would prevail,"
32445,ROBERT BROWNING,Nor could to-night’s gay feast restrain
32446,ROBERT BROWNING,A sudden thought of one so pale
32447,ROBERT BROWNING,"For love of her, and all in vain:"
32448,ROBERT BROWNING,"So, she was come through wind and rain."
32449,ROBERT BROWNING,Be sure I look’d up at her eyes
32450,ROBERT BROWNING,Happy and proud; at last I knew
32451,ROBERT BROWNING,Porphyria worshipp’d me; surprise
32452,ROBERT BROWNING,"Made my heart swell, and still it grew"
32453,ROBERT BROWNING,While I debated what to do.
32454,ROBERT BROWNING,"That moment she was mine, mine, fair,"
32455,ROBERT BROWNING,Perfectly pure and good: I found
32456,ROBERT BROWNING,"A thing to do, and all her hair"
32457,ROBERT BROWNING,In one long yellow string I wound
32458,ROBERT BROWNING,"Three times her little throat around,"
32459,ROBERT BROWNING,And strangled her. No pain felt she;
32460,ROBERT BROWNING,I am quite sure she felt no pain.
32461,ROBERT BROWNING,"As a shut bud that holds a bee,"
32462,ROBERT BROWNING,I warily oped her lids: again
32463,ROBERT BROWNING,Laugh’d the blue eyes without a stain.
32464,ROBERT BROWNING,And I untighten’d next the tress
32465,ROBERT BROWNING,About her neck; her cheek once more
32466,ROBERT BROWNING,Blush’d bright beneath my burning kiss:
32467,ROBERT BROWNING,"I propp’d her head up as before,"
32468,ROBERT BROWNING,"Only, this time my shoulder bore"
32469,ROBERT BROWNING,"Her head, which droops upon it still:"
32470,ROBERT BROWNING,"The smiling rosy little head,"
32471,ROBERT BROWNING,"So glad it has its utmost will,"
32472,ROBERT BROWNING,"That all it scorn’d at once is fled,"
32473,ROBERT BROWNING,"And I, its love, am gain’d instead!"
32474,ROBERT BROWNING,Porphyria’s love: she guess’d not how
32475,ROBERT BROWNING,Her darling one wish would be heard.
32476,ROBERT BROWNING,"And thus we sit together now,"
32477,ROBERT BROWNING,"And all night long we have not stirr’d,"

33540,MATTHEW ARNOLD,For her eyes were seal’d to the holy book.
33541,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.
33542,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Come away, children, call no more."
33543,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Come away, come down, call no more."
33544,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33545,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Down, down, down;"
33546,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Down to the depths of the sea.
33547,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
33548,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Singing most joyfully.
33549,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Hark what she sings: ‘O joy, O joy,"
33550,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy."
33551,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well."
33552,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For the wheel where I spun,"
33553,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And the blessed light of the sun.’
33554,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And so she sings her fill,"
33555,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Singing most joyfully,"
33556,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Till the shuttle falls from her hand,"
33557,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
33558,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"She steals to the window, and looks at the sand;"
33559,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And over the sand at the sea;
33560,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And her eyes are set in a stare;
33561,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"
33562,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And anon there drops a tear,"
33563,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"From a sorrow-clouded eye,"
33564,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And a heart sorrow-laden,"
33565,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"A long, long sigh"
33566,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden,"
33567,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And the gleam of her golden hair.
33568,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33569,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Come away, away, children."
33570,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Come children, come down."
33571,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The hoarse wind blows colder;
33572,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Lights shine in the town.
33573,MATTHEW ARNOLD,She will start from her slumber
33574,MATTHEW ARNOLD,When gusts shake the door;
33575,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"She will hear the winds howling,"
33576,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Will hear the waves roar.
33577,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"We shall see, while above us"
33578,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"The waves roar and whirl,"
33579,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"A ceiling of amber,"
33580,MATTHEW ARNOLD,A pavement of pearl.
33581,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Singing, ‘Here came a mortal,"
33582,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But faithless was she:
33583,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And alone dwell for ever
33584,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The kings of the sea.’
33585,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33586,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But, children, at midnight,"
33587,MATTHEW ARNOLD,When soft the winds blow;
33588,MATTHEW ARNOLD,When clear falls the moonlight;
33589,MATTHEW ARNOLD,When spring-tides are low:
33590,MATTHEW ARNOLD,When sweet airs come seaward
33591,MATTHEW ARNOLD,From heaths starr’d with broom;
33592,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And high rocks throw mildly
33593,MATTHEW ARNOLD,On the blanch’d sands a gloom:
33594,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Up the still, glistening beaches,"
33595,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Up the creeks we will hie;
33596,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Over banks of bright seaweed
33597,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The ebb-tide leaves dry.
33598,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"We will gaze, from the sand-hills,"
33599,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"At the white, sleeping town;"
33600,MATTHEW ARNOLD,At the church on the hill-side--
33601,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And then come back down.
33602,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Singing, ‘There dwells a loved one,"
33603,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But cruel is she.
33604,MATTHEW ARNOLD,She left lonely for ever
33605,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The kings of the sea.’

33613,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Her forest-clothed frame.
33614,MATTHEW ARNOLD,

33618,MATTHEW ARNOLD,In cliff to the sea.
33619,MATTHEW ARNOLD,

33624,MATTHEW ARNOLD,

33626,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Lie strewn the white flocks;
33627,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"On the cliff-side, the pigeons"

33629,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33630,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"In the moonlight the shepherds,"
33631,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Soft lull’d by the rills,"
33632,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Lie wrapt in their blankets,"
33633,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Asleep on the hills.
33634,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33635,MATTHEW ARNOLD,--What forms are these coming
33636,MATTHEW ARNOLD,So white through the gloom?
33637,MATTHEW ARNOLD,What garments out-glistening
33638,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The gold-flower’d broom?
33639,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33640,MATTHEW ARNOLD,What sweet-breathing Presence
33641,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Out-perfumes the thyme?

33650,MATTHEW ARNOLD,They are lost in the hollows.
33651,MATTHEW ARNOLD,They stream up again.
33652,MATTHEW ARNOLD,What seeks on this mountain

33681,MATTHEW ARNOLD,We mortal millions live _alone_.
33682,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"The islands feel the enclasping flow,"

33713,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33714,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Her mirth the world required:

33731,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33732,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Go, for they call you, Shepherd, from the hill;"
33733,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Go, Shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes:"
33734,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed,"
33735,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,"
33736,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Nor the cropp’d grasses shoot another head.
33737,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But when the fields are still,"
33738,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,"
33739,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And only the white sheep are sometimes seen
33740,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Cross and recross the strips of moon-blanch’d green;
33741,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Come, Shepherd, and again begin the quest."
33742,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33743,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Here, where the reaper was at work of late,"
33744,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"In this high field’s dark corner, where he leaves"
33745,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruise,"
33746,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,"
33747,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use;"
33748,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Here will I sit and wait,"
33749,MATTHEW ARNOLD,While to my ear from uplands far away
33750,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,"
33751,MATTHEW ARNOLD,With distant cries of reapers in the corn--
33752,MATTHEW ARNOLD,All the live murmur of a summer’s day.
33753,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33754,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Screen’d is this nook o’er the high, half-reap’d field,"
33755,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And here till sundown, Shepherd, will I be."
33756,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,"
33757,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see
33758,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Pale blue convolvulus in tendrils creep:
33759,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And air-swept lindens yield
33760,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers"
33761,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,"
33762,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And bower me from the August sun with shade;
33763,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And the eye travels down to Oxford’s towers:
33764,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33765,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33766,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And near me on the grass lies Glanvil’s book--
33767,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Come, let me read the oft-read tale again:"
33768,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"The story of that Oxford scholar poor,"
33769,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,"
33770,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Who, tired of knocking at Preferment’s door,"
33771,MATTHEW ARNOLD,One summer morn forsook
33772,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"His friends, and went to learn the Gipsy lore,"
33773,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And roam’d the world with that wild brotherhood,"
33774,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And came, as most men deem’d, to little good,"
33775,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But came to Oxford and his friends no more.
33776,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33777,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But once, years after, in the country lanes,"
33778,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,"
33779,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Met him, and of his way of life inquired."
33780,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Whereat he answer’d that the Gipsy crew,"
33781,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"His mates, had arts to rule as they desired"
33782,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The workings of men’s brains;
33783,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And they can bind them to what thoughts they will:
33784,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"‘And I,’ he said, ‘the secret of their art,"
33785,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"When fully learn’d, will to the world impart:"
33786,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But it needs Heaven-sent moments for this skill!’
33787,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33788,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"This said, he left them, and return’d no more,"
33789,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But rumours hung about the country-side,"
33790,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,"
33791,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,"
33792,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,"
33793,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The same the Gipsies wore.
33794,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;
33795,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,"
33796,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frock’d boors"
33797,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Had found him seated at their entering,"
33798,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But, ’mid their drink and clatter, he would fly:"
33799,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And I myself seem half to know thy looks,"
33800,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And put the shepherds, Wanderer, on thy trace;"
33801,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks
33802,MATTHEW ARNOLD,I ask if thou hast pass’d their quiet place;
33803,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Or in my boat I lie
33804,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Moor’d to the cool bank in the summer heats,"
33805,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"‘Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,"
33806,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And watch the warm green-muffled Cumnor hills,"
33807,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And wonder if thou haunt’st their shy retreats.
33808,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33809,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For most, I know, thou lov’st retirèd ground."
33810,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thee, at the ferry, Oxford riders blithe,"
33811,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Returning home on summer nights, have met"
33812,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Crossing the stripling Thames at Bablock-hithe,"
33813,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,"
33814,MATTHEW ARNOLD,As the slow punt swings round:
33815,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And leaning backwards in a pensive dream,"
33816,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers
33817,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Pluck’d in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,"
33818,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream:
33819,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33820,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And then they land, and thou art seen no more."
33821,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Maidens who from the distant hamlets come
33822,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,"
33823,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,"
33824,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Or cross a stile into the public way.
33825,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Oft thou hast given them store
33826,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Of flowers--the frail-leaf’d, white anemone--"
33827,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Dark bluebells drench’d with dews of summer eves,"
33828,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And purple orchises with spotted leaves--
33829,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But none has words she can report of thee.
33830,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33831,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time’s here"
33832,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,"
33833,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass
33834,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Where black-wing’d swallows haunt the glittering Thames,"
33835,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"To bathe in the abandon’d lasher pass,"
33836,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Have often pass’d thee near
33837,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Sitting upon the river bank o’ergrown:
33838,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Mark’d thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,"
33839,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air;"
33840,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But, when they came from bathing, thou wert gone."
33841,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33842,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"At some lone homestead in the Cumnor hills,"
33843,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Where at her open door the housewife darns,"
33844,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate"
33845,MATTHEW ARNOLD,To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.
33846,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Children, who early range these slopes and late"
33847,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For cresses from the rills,"
33848,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Have known thee watching, all an April day,"
33849,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The springing pastures and the feeding kine;
33850,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And mark’d thee, when the stars come out and shine,"
33851,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Through the long dewy grass move slow away.
33852,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33853,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood,"
33854,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Where most the Gipsies by the turf-edged way
33855,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see"
33856,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"With scarlet patches tagg’d and shreds of gray,"
33857,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Above the forest-ground call’d Thessaly--
33858,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The blackbird picking food
33859,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;"
33860,MATTHEW ARNOLD,So often has he known thee past him stray
33861,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither’d spray,"
33862,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And waiting for the spark from Heaven to fall.
33863,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33864,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And once, in winter, on the causeway chill"
33865,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,"
33866,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Have I not pass’d thee on the wooden bridge
33867,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow,"
33868,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Thy face towards Hinksey and its wintry ridge?
33869,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And thou hast climb’d the hill
33870,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And gain’d the white brow of the Cumnor range;
33871,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Turn’d once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,"
33872,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The line of festal light in Christ Church hall--
33873,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Then sought thy straw in some sequester’d grange.
33874,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33875,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But what--I dream! Two hundred years are flown
33876,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,"
33877,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe
33878,MATTHEW ARNOLD,That thou wert wander’d from the studious walls
33879,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"To learn strange arts, and join a Gipsy tribe:"
33880,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And thou from earth art gone
33881,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid;"
33882,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Some country nook, where o’er thy unknown grave"
33883,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave--
33884,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Under a dark red-fruited yew-tree’s shade.
33885,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33886,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"--No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours."
33887,MATTHEW ARNOLD,For what wears out the life of mortal men?
33888,MATTHEW ARNOLD,’Tis that from change to change their being rolls:
33889,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"’Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,"
33890,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Exhaust the energy of strongest souls,"
33891,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And numb the elastic powers.
33892,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,"
33893,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,"
33894,MATTHEW ARNOLD,To the just-pausing Genius we remit
33895,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Our worn-out life, and are--what we have been."
33896,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33897,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thou hast not lived, why shouldst thou perish, so?"
33898,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thou hadst _one_ aim, _one_ business, _one_ desire:"
33899,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Else wert thou long since number’d with the dead--
33900,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire."
33901,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"The generations of thy peers are fled,"
33902,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And we ourselves shall go;
33903,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But thou possessest an immortal lot,"
33904,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And we imagine thee exempt from age
33905,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And living as thou liv’st on Glanvil’s page,"
33906,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Because thou hadst--what we, alas, have not!"
33907,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33908,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For early didst thou leave the world, with powers"
33909,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Fresh, undiverted to the world without,"
33910,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;"
33911,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,"
33912,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings."
33913,MATTHEW ARNOLD,O Life unlike to ours!
33914,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Who fluctuate idly without term or scope,"
33915,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives,"
33916,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And each half lives a hundred different lives;
33917,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope."
33918,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33919,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thou waitest for the spark from Heaven: and we,"
33920,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Vague half-believers of our casual creeds,"
33921,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Who never deeply felt, nor clearly will’d,"
33922,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,"
33923,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Whose weak resolves never have been fulfill’d;
33924,MATTHEW ARNOLD,For whom each year we see
33925,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Breeds new beginnings, disappointments new;"

33932,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Who most has suffer’d, takes dejectedly"
33933,MATTHEW ARNOLD,His seat upon the intellectual throne;
33934,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And all his store of sad experience he
33935,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Lays bare of wretched days;
33936,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Tells us his misery’s birth and growth and signs,"
33937,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And how the dying spark of hope was fed,"
33938,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,"
33939,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And all his hourly varied anodynes.
33940,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33941,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"This for our wisest: and we others pine,"
33942,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And wish the long unhappy dream would end,"

33945,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Sad Patience, too near neighbour to Despair:"
33946,MATTHEW ARNOLD,But none has hope like thine.
33947,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,"
33948,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Roaming the country-side, a truant boy,"
33949,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Nursing thy project in unclouded joy,"
33950,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And every doubt long blown by time away.
33951,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33952,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"O born in days when wits were fresh and clear,"
33953,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;
33954,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Before this strange disease of modern life,"
33955,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"With its sick hurry, its divided aims,"
33956,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Its heads o’ertax’d, its palsied hearts, was rife--"
33957,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Fly hence, our contact fear!"
33958,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!"
33959,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern"
33960,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"From her false friend’s approach in Hades turn,"
33961,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Wave us away, and keep thy solitude."
33962,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33963,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Still nursing the unconquerable hope,"

33966,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"By night, the silver’d branches of the glade--"
33967,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue."
33968,MATTHEW ARNOLD,On some mild pastoral slope
33969,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales,"
33970,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Freshen thy flowers, as in former years,"
33971,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,"
33972,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"From the dark dingles, to the nightingales."
33973,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33974,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly!"
33975,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"For strong the infection of our mental strife,"
33976,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest;"
33977,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And we should win thee from thy own fair life,"
33978,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Like us distracted, and like us unblest."
33979,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Soon, soon thy cheer would die,"
33980,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfix’d thy powers,"
33981,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made:
33982,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,"
33983,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Fade, and grow old at last, and die like ours."
33984,MATTHEW ARNOLD,
33985,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!"
33986,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"--As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,"
33987,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Descried at sunrise an emerging prow
33988,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Lifting the cool-hair’d creepers stealthily,"
33989,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The fringes of a southward-facing brow
33990,MATTHEW ARNOLD,Among the Ægean isles;
33991,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,"
33992,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,"
33993,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Green bursting figs, and tunnies steep’d in brine;"
33994,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And knew the intruders on his ancient home,"
33995,MATTHEW ARNOLD,The young light-hearted Masters of the waves;
33996,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"And snatch’d his rudder, and shook out more sail,"
33997,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And day and night held on indignantly
33998,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"O’er the blue Midland waters with the gale,"
33999,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Betwixt the Syrtes and soft Sicily,"
34000,MATTHEW ARNOLD,To where the Atlantic raves
34001,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Outside the Western Straits, and unbent sails"
34002,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"There, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam,"
34003,MATTHEW ARNOLD,"Shy traffickers, the dark Iberians come;"
34004,MATTHEW ARNOLD,And on the beach undid his corded bales.

34133,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34134,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Into the skies, one summer’s day,"
34135,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,I sent a little Thought away;
34136,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Up to where, in the blue round,"
34137,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,The sun sat shining without sound.
34138,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34139,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Then my Thought came back to me.--
34140,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Little Thought, what did you see"
34141,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,In the regions whence you come?
34142,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"And when I spoke, my Thought was dumb."
34143,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34144,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"But she breathed of what was there,"
34145,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,In the pure bright upper air;
34146,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"And, because my Thought so shone,"
34147,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,I knew she had been shone upon.
34148,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34149,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Next, by night a Thought I sent"
34150,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Up into the firmament;
34151,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"When the eager stars were out,"
34152,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,And the still moon shone about.
34153,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34154,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,And my Thought went past the moon
34155,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"In between the stars, but soon"
34156,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Held her breath and durst not stir,"
34157,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,For the fear that covered her;
34158,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Then she thought, in this demur:"
34159,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34160,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"‘Dare I look beneath the shade,"
34161,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Into where the worlds are made;
34162,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Where the suns and stars are wrought?
34163,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Shall I meet another Thought?
34164,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34165,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,‘Will that other Thought have wings?
34166,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?"
34167,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Thought of Thoughts, and Light of Lights,"
34168,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Breath of Breaths, and Night of Nights?’"
34169,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34170,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Then my Thought began to hark
34171,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"In the illuminated dark,"
34172,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Till the silence, over, under,"
34173,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,Made her heart beat more than thunder.
34174,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,
34175,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"And my Thought, came trembling back,"
34176,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"But with something on her track,"
34177,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,And with something at her side;
34178,WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS,"Nor till she has lived and died,"

34321,COVENTRY PATMORE,But by the noble style that still
34322,COVENTRY PATMORE,Imputes an unattain’d desert;
34323,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Because her gay and lofty brows,"
34324,COVENTRY PATMORE,"When all is won which hope can ask,"
34325,COVENTRY PATMORE,Reflect a light of hopeless snows
34326,COVENTRY PATMORE,That bright in virgin ether bask;
34327,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Because, though free of the outer court"
34328,COVENTRY PATMORE,"I am, this Temple keeps its shrine"
34329,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Sacred to Heaven; because, in short,"
34330,COVENTRY PATMORE,She’s not and never can be mine.

34334,COVENTRY PATMORE,
34335,COVENTRY PATMORE,"‘If I were dead, you’d sometimes say, Poor Child!’"
34336,COVENTRY PATMORE,"The dear lips quiver’d as they spake,"
34337,COVENTRY PATMORE,And the tears brake
34338,COVENTRY PATMORE,"From eyes which, not to grieve me, brightly smiled."
34339,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Poor Child, poor Child!"
34340,COVENTRY PATMORE,"I seem to hear your laugh, your talk, your song."
34341,COVENTRY PATMORE,It is not true that Love will do no wrong.
34342,COVENTRY PATMORE,Poor Child!
34343,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And did you think, when you so cried and smiled,"
34344,COVENTRY PATMORE,"How I, in lonely nights, should lie awake,"
34345,COVENTRY PATMORE,And of those words your full avengers make?
34346,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Poor Child, poor Child!"
34347,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And now, unless it be"
34348,COVENTRY PATMORE,"That sweet amends thrice told are come to thee,"
34349,COVENTRY PATMORE,"O God, have Thou _no_ mercy upon me!"

34353,COVENTRY PATMORE,_762._ _Departure_
34354,COVENTRY PATMORE,
34355,COVENTRY PATMORE,It was not like your great and gracious ways!
34356,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Do you, that have naught other to lament,"
34357,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Never, my Love, repent"
34358,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Of how, that July afternoon,"
34359,COVENTRY PATMORE,"You went,"
34360,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With sudden, unintelligible phrase,"
34361,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And frighten’d eye,"
34362,COVENTRY PATMORE,Upon your journey of so many days
34363,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Without a single kiss, or a good-bye?"
34364,COVENTRY PATMORE,"I knew, indeed, that you were parting soon;"
34365,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And so we sate, within the low sun’s rays,"
34366,COVENTRY PATMORE,"You whispering to me, for your voice was weak,"
34367,COVENTRY PATMORE,Your harrowing praise.
34368,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Well, it was well"
34369,COVENTRY PATMORE,"To hear you such things speak,"
34370,COVENTRY PATMORE,And I could tell
34371,COVENTRY PATMORE,"What made your eyes a growing gloom of love,"
34372,COVENTRY PATMORE,As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove.
34373,COVENTRY PATMORE,And it was like your great and gracious ways
34374,COVENTRY PATMORE,"To turn your talk on daily things, my Dear,"
34375,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Lifting the luminous, pathetic lash"
34376,COVENTRY PATMORE,"To let the laughter flash,"
34377,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Whilst I drew near,"
34378,COVENTRY PATMORE,Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear.
34379,COVENTRY PATMORE,"But all at once to leave me at the last,"
34380,COVENTRY PATMORE,"More at the wonder than the loss aghast,"
34381,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With huddled, unintelligible phrase,"
34382,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And frighten’d eye,"
34383,COVENTRY PATMORE,And go your journey of all days
34384,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With not one kiss, or a good-bye,"
34385,COVENTRY PATMORE,And the only loveless look the look with which you pass’d:
34386,COVENTRY PATMORE,’Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways.

34389,COVENTRY PATMORE,_763._ _The Toys_
34390,COVENTRY PATMORE,
34391,COVENTRY PATMORE,"My little Son, who look’d from thoughtful eyes"
34392,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise,"
34393,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Having my law the seventh time disobey’d,"
34394,COVENTRY PATMORE,"I struck him, and dismissed"
34395,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With hard words and unkiss’d,"
34396,COVENTRY PATMORE,"--His Mother, who was patient, being dead."
34397,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,"
34398,COVENTRY PATMORE,"I visited his bed,"
34399,COVENTRY PATMORE,"But found him slumbering deep,"
34400,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With darkened eyelids, and their lashes yet"
34401,COVENTRY PATMORE,From his late sobbing wet.
34402,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And I, with moan,"
34403,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;"
34404,COVENTRY PATMORE,"For, on a table drawn beside his head,"
34405,COVENTRY PATMORE,"He had put, within his reach,"
34406,COVENTRY PATMORE,"A box of counters and a red-vein’d stone,"
34407,COVENTRY PATMORE,"A piece of glass abraded by the beach,"
34408,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And six or seven shells,"
34409,COVENTRY PATMORE,"A bottle with bluebells,"
34410,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art,"
34411,COVENTRY PATMORE,To comfort his sad heart.
34412,COVENTRY PATMORE,So when that night I pray’d
34413,COVENTRY PATMORE,"To God, I wept, and said:"
34414,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Ah, when at last we lie with trancèd breath,"
34415,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Not vexing Thee in death,"
34416,COVENTRY PATMORE,And Thou rememberest of what toys
34417,COVENTRY PATMORE,"We made our joys,"
34418,COVENTRY PATMORE,How weakly understood
34419,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Thy great commanded good,"
34420,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Then, fatherly not less"
34421,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay,"
34422,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Thou’lt leave Thy wrath, and say,"
34423,COVENTRY PATMORE,‘I will be sorry for their childishness.’

34427,COVENTRY PATMORE,
34428,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With all my will, but much against my heart,"
34429,COVENTRY PATMORE,We two now part.
34430,COVENTRY PATMORE,"My Very Dear,"
34431,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Our solace is, the sad road lies so clear."
34432,COVENTRY PATMORE,"It needs no art,"
34433,COVENTRY PATMORE,"With faint, averted feet"
34434,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And many a tear,"
34435,COVENTRY PATMORE,In our opposèd paths to persevere.
34436,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Go thou to East, I West."
34437,COVENTRY PATMORE,We will not say
34438,COVENTRY PATMORE,"There’s any hope, it is so far away."
34439,COVENTRY PATMORE,"But, O, my Best,"
34440,COVENTRY PATMORE,"When the one darling of our widowhead,"
34441,COVENTRY PATMORE,"The nursling Grief,"
34442,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Is dead,"
34443,COVENTRY PATMORE,And no dews blur our eyes
34444,COVENTRY PATMORE,"To see the peach-bloom come in evening skies,"
34445,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Perchance we may,"
34446,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Where now this night is day,"
34447,COVENTRY PATMORE,"And even through faith of still averted feet,"
34448,COVENTRY PATMORE,"Making full circle of our banishment,"
34449,COVENTRY PATMORE,Amazèd meet;
34450,COVENTRY PATMORE,The bitter journey to the bourne so sweet
34451,COVENTRY PATMORE,Seasoning the termless feast of our content
34452,COVENTRY PATMORE,With tears of recognition never dry.

34462,SYDNEY DOBELL,_765._ _The Ballad of Keith of Ravelston_
34463,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34464,SYDNEY DOBELL,The murmur of the mourning ghost
34465,SYDNEY DOBELL,"That keeps the shadowy kine,"
34466,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘O Keith of Ravelston,"
34467,SYDNEY DOBELL,The sorrows of thy line!’
34468,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34469,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Ravelston, Ravelston,"
34470,SYDNEY DOBELL,The merry path that leads
34471,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Down the golden morning hill,"
34472,SYDNEY DOBELL,And thro’ the silver meads;
34473,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34474,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Ravelston, Ravelston,"
34475,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The stile beneath the tree,"
34476,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The maid that kept her mother’s kine,"
34477,SYDNEY DOBELL,The song that sang she!
34478,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34479,SYDNEY DOBELL,"She sang her song, she kept her kine,"
34480,SYDNEY DOBELL,"She sat beneath the thorn,"
34481,SYDNEY DOBELL,When Andrew Keith of Ravelston
34482,SYDNEY DOBELL,Rode thro’ the Monday morn.
34483,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34484,SYDNEY DOBELL,"His henchmen sing, his hawk-bells ring,"
34485,SYDNEY DOBELL,His belted jewels shine;
34486,SYDNEY DOBELL,"O Keith of Ravelston,"
34487,SYDNEY DOBELL,The sorrows of thy line!
34488,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34489,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Year after year, where Andrew came,"
34490,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Comes evening down the glade,"
34491,SYDNEY DOBELL,And still there sits a moonshine ghost
34492,SYDNEY DOBELL,Where sat the sunshine maid.
34493,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34494,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Her misty hair is faint and fair,"
34495,SYDNEY DOBELL,She keeps the shadowy kine;
34496,SYDNEY DOBELL,"O Keith of Ravelston,"
34497,SYDNEY DOBELL,The sorrows of thy line!
34498,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34499,SYDNEY DOBELL,"I lay my hand upon the stile,"
34500,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The stile is lone and cold,"
34501,SYDNEY DOBELL,The burnie that goes babbling by
34502,SYDNEY DOBELL,Says naught that can be told.
34503,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34504,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Yet, stranger! here, from year to year,"
34505,SYDNEY DOBELL,She keeps her shadowy kine;
34506,SYDNEY DOBELL,"O Keith of Ravelston,"
34507,SYDNEY DOBELL,The sorrows of thy line!
34508,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34509,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Step out three steps, where Andrew stood--"
34510,SYDNEY DOBELL,Why blanch thy cheeks for fear?
34511,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The ancient stile is not alone,"
34512,SYDNEY DOBELL,’Tis not the burn I hear!
34513,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34514,SYDNEY DOBELL,"She makes her immemorial moan,"
34515,SYDNEY DOBELL,She keeps her shadowy kine;
34516,SYDNEY DOBELL,"O Keith of Ravelston,"
34517,SYDNEY DOBELL,The sorrows of thy line!

34520,SYDNEY DOBELL,_766._ _Return!_
34521,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34522,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return! all night my lamp is burning,"
34523,SYDNEY DOBELL,"All night, like it, my wide eyes watch and burn;"
34524,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like it, I fade and pale, when day returning"
34525,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Bears witness that the absent can return,"
34526,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return."
34527,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34528,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like it, I lessen with a lengthening sadness,"
34529,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like it, I burn to waste and waste to burn,"
34530,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like it, I spend the golden oil of gladness"
34531,SYDNEY DOBELL,"To feed the sorrowy signal for return,"
34532,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return."
34533,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34534,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like it, like it, whene’er the east wind sings,"
34535,SYDNEY DOBELL,"I bend and shake; like it, I quake and yearn,"
34536,SYDNEY DOBELL,"When Hope’s late butterflies, with whispering wings,"
34537,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Fly in out of the dark, to fall and burn--"
34538,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Burn in the watchfire of return,"
34539,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return."
34540,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34541,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like it, the very flame whereby I pine"
34542,SYDNEY DOBELL,Consumes me to its nature. While I mourn
34543,SYDNEY DOBELL,"My soul becomes a better soul than mine,"
34544,SYDNEY DOBELL,And from its brightening beacon I discern
34545,SYDNEY DOBELL,"My starry love go forth from me, and shine"
34546,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Across the seas a path for thy return,"
34547,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return."
34548,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34549,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return! all night I see it burn,"
34550,SYDNEY DOBELL,"All night it prays like me, and lifts a twin"
34551,SYDNEY DOBELL,Of palmèd praying hands that meet and yearn--
34552,SYDNEY DOBELL,Yearn to the impleaded skies for thy return.
34553,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Day, like a golden fetter, locks them in,"
34554,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And wans the light that withers, tho’ it burn"
34555,SYDNEY DOBELL,As warmly still for thy return;
34556,SYDNEY DOBELL,Still thro’ the splendid load uplifts the thin
34557,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Pale, paler, palest patience that can learn"
34558,SYDNEY DOBELL,Naught but that votive sign for thy return--
34559,SYDNEY DOBELL,"That single suppliant sign for thy return,"
34560,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return."
34561,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34562,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return! lest haply, love, or e’er"
34563,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Thou touch the lamp the light have ceased to burn,"
34564,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And thou, who thro’ the window didst discern"
34565,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The wonted flame, shalt reach the topmost stair"
34566,SYDNEY DOBELL,"To find no wide eyes watching there,"
34567,SYDNEY DOBELL,No wither’d welcome waiting thy return!
34568,SYDNEY DOBELL,"A passing ghost, a smoke-wreath in the air,"
34569,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The flameless ashes, and the soulless urn,"
34570,SYDNEY DOBELL,Warm with the famish’d fire that lived to burn--
34571,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Burn out its lingering life for thy return,"
34572,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Its last of lingering life for thy return,"
34573,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Its last of lingering life to light thy late return,"
34574,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Return, return."

34577,SYDNEY DOBELL,_767._ _A Chanted Calendar_
34578,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34579,SYDNEY DOBELL,"First came the primrose,"
34580,SYDNEY DOBELL,"On the bank high,"
34581,SYDNEY DOBELL,Like a maiden looking forth
34582,SYDNEY DOBELL,From the window of a tower
34583,SYDNEY DOBELL,"When the battle rolls below,"
34584,SYDNEY DOBELL,"So look’d she,"
34585,SYDNEY DOBELL,And saw the storms go by.
34586,SYDNEY DOBELL,Then came the wind-flower
34587,SYDNEY DOBELL,"In the valley left behind,"
34588,SYDNEY DOBELL,"As a wounded maiden, pale"
34589,SYDNEY DOBELL,"With purple streaks of woe,"
34590,SYDNEY DOBELL,When the battle has roll’d by
34591,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Wanders to and fro,"
34592,SYDNEY DOBELL,"So totter’d she,"
34593,SYDNEY DOBELL,Dishevelled in the wind.
34594,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34595,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Then came the daisies,"
34596,SYDNEY DOBELL,"On the first of May,"
34597,SYDNEY DOBELL,Like a banner’d show’s advance
34598,SYDNEY DOBELL,"While the crowd runs by the way,"
34599,SYDNEY DOBELL,With ten thousand flowers about them they came trooping through the fields.
34600,SYDNEY DOBELL,"As a happy people come,"
34601,SYDNEY DOBELL,"So came they,"
34602,SYDNEY DOBELL,As a happy people come
34603,SYDNEY DOBELL,"When the war has roll’d away,"
34604,SYDNEY DOBELL,"With dance and tabor, pipe and drum."
34605,SYDNEY DOBELL,And all make holiday.
34606,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34607,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Then came the cowslip,"
34608,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Like a dancer in the fair,"
34609,SYDNEY DOBELL,"She spread her little mat of green,"
34610,SYDNEY DOBELL,And on it danced she.
34611,SYDNEY DOBELL,"With a fillet bound about her brow,"
34612,SYDNEY DOBELL,"A fillet round her happy brow,"
34613,SYDNEY DOBELL,"A golden fillet round her brow,"
34614,SYDNEY DOBELL,And rubies in her hair.

34617,SYDNEY DOBELL,_768._ _Laus Deo_
34618,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34619,SYDNEY DOBELL,"In the hall the coffin waits, and the idle armourer stands."
34620,SYDNEY DOBELL,"At his belt the coffin nails, and the hammer in his hands."
34621,SYDNEY DOBELL,The bed of state is hung with crape--the grand old bed where she was wed--
34622,SYDNEY DOBELL,And like an upright corpse she sitteth gazing dumbly at the bed.
34623,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Hour by hour her serving-men enter by the curtain’d door,"
34624,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And with steps of muffled woe pass breathless o’er the silent floor,"
34625,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And marshal mutely round, and look from each to each with eyelids red;"
34626,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘Touch him not,’ she shriek’d and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’"
34627,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘O my own dear mistress,’ the ancient Nurse did say,"
34628,SYDNEY DOBELL,‘Seven long days and seven long nights you have watch’d him where he lay.’
34629,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘Seven long days and seven long nights,‘the hoary Steward said;"
34630,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘Seven long days and seven long nights,’ groan’d the Warrener gray;"
34631,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘Seven,’ said the old Henchman, and bow’d his aged head;"
34632,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘On your lives!’ she shriek’d and cried,‘he is but newly dead!’"
34633,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Then a father Priest they sought,"
34634,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The Priest that taught her all she knew,"
34635,SYDNEY DOBELL,And they told him of her loss.
34636,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘For she is mild and sweet of will,"
34637,SYDNEY DOBELL,"She loved him, and his words are peace,"
34638,SYDNEY DOBELL,And he shall heal her ill.’
34639,SYDNEY DOBELL,But her watch she did not cease.
34640,SYDNEY DOBELL,"He bless’d her where she sat distraught,"
34641,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And show’d her holy cross,--"
34642,SYDNEY DOBELL,The cross she kiss’d from year to year--
34643,SYDNEY DOBELL,But she neither saw nor heard;
34644,SYDNEY DOBELL,And said he in her deaf ear
34645,SYDNEY DOBELL,"All he had been wont to teach,"
34646,SYDNEY DOBELL,"All she had been fond to hear,"
34647,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Missall’d prayer, and solemn speech,"
34648,SYDNEY DOBELL,But she answer’d not a word.
34649,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Only when he turn’d to speak with those who wept about the bed,"
34650,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘On your lives!’ she shriek’d and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’"
34651,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Then how sadly he turn’d from her, it were wonderful to tell,"
34652,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And he stood beside the death-bed as by one who slumbers well,"
34653,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And he lean’d o’er him who lay there, and in cautious whisper low,"
34654,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘He is not dead, but sleepeth,’ said the Priest, and smooth’d his brow."
34655,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘Sleepeth?’ said she, looking up, and the sun rose in her face!"
34656,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘He must be better than I thought, for the sleep is very sound.’"
34657,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘He is better,’ said the Priest, and call’d her maidens round."
34658,SYDNEY DOBELL,With them came that ancient dame who nursed her when a child;
34659,SYDNEY DOBELL,"O Nurse!’ she sigh’d, ‘O Nurse!’ she cried, ‘O Nurse!’ and then she smiled,"
34660,SYDNEY DOBELL,And then she wept; with that they drew
34661,SYDNEY DOBELL,"About her, as of old;"
34662,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Her dying eyes were sweet and blue,"
34663,SYDNEY DOBELL,Her trembling touch was cold;
34664,SYDNEY DOBELL,"But she said, ‘My maidens true,"
34665,SYDNEY DOBELL,No more weeping and well-away;
34666,SYDNEY DOBELL,Let them kill the feast.
34667,SYDNEY DOBELL,I would be happy in my soul.
34668,SYDNEY DOBELL,"“He is better,” saith the Priest;"
34669,SYDNEY DOBELL,"He did but sleep the weary day,"
34670,SYDNEY DOBELL,And will waken whole.
34671,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Carry me to his dear side,"
34672,SYDNEY DOBELL,And let the halls be trim;
34673,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Whistly, whistly,’ said she,"
34674,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘I am wan with watching and wail,"
34675,SYDNEY DOBELL,"He must not wake to see me pale,"
34676,SYDNEY DOBELL,Let me sleep with him.
34677,SYDNEY DOBELL,"See you keep the tryst for me,"
34678,SYDNEY DOBELL,I would rest till he awake
34679,SYDNEY DOBELL,And rise up like a bride.
34680,SYDNEY DOBELL,"But whistly, whistly!’ said she."
34681,SYDNEY DOBELL,‘Yet rejoice your Lord doth live;
34682,SYDNEY DOBELL,And for His dear sake
34683,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Say _Laus, Domine_.’"
34684,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Silent they cast down their eyes,"
34685,SYDNEY DOBELL,"And every breast a sob did rive,"
34686,SYDNEY DOBELL,She lifted her in wild surprise
34687,SYDNEY DOBELL,And they dared not disobey.
34688,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘_Laus Deo_,’ said the Steward, hoary when her days were new;"
34689,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘_Laus Deo_,’ said the Warrener, whiter than the warren snows;"
34690,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘_Laus Deo_,’ the bald Henchman, who had nursed her on his knee."
34691,SYDNEY DOBELL,"The old Nurse moved her lips in vain,"

34693,SYDNEY DOBELL,Like a dead tree shaking dew.
34694,SYDNEY DOBELL,Then the Priest he softly slept
34695,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Midway in the little band,"
34696,SYDNEY DOBELL,And he took the Lady’s hand.
34697,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘_Laus Deo_,’ he said aloud,"
34698,SYDNEY DOBELL,"‘_Laus Deo_,’ they said again,"
34699,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Yet again, and yet again,"
34700,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Humbly cross’d and lowly bow’d,"
34701,SYDNEY DOBELL,Till in wont and fear it rose
34702,SYDNEY DOBELL,To the Sabbath strain.
34703,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34704,SYDNEY DOBELL,
34705,SYDNEY DOBELL,But she neither turn’d her head
34706,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Nor ‘Whistly, whistly,’ said she."
34707,SYDNEY DOBELL,"Her hands were folded as in grace,"
34708,SYDNEY DOBELL,We laid her with her ancient race
34709,SYDNEY DOBELL,And all the village wept.

34820,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,From the gold bar of Heaven:
34821,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Her blue grave eyes were deeper much
34822,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Than a deep water, even."
34823,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"She had three lilies in her hand,"
34824,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And the stars in her hair were seven.
34825,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34826,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34827,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,"
34828,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"No wrought flowers did adorn,"
34829,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,But a white rose of Mary’s gift
34830,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,On the neck meetly worn;
34831,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"And her hair, lying down her back,"
34832,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Was yellow like ripe corn.
34833,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34834,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Herseem’d she scarce had been a day
34835,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,One of God’s choristers;
34836,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,The wonder was not yet quite gone
34837,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,From that still look of hers;
34838,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Albeit, to them she left, her day"
34839,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Had counted as ten years.
34840,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34841,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,(To _one_ it is ten years of years:

34843,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Surely she lean’d o’er me,--her hair"
34844,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Fell all about my face....
34845,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Nothing: the Autumn-fall of leaves.
34846,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,The whole year sets apace.)
34847,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34848,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,It was the terrace of God’s house
34849,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"That she was standing on,--"
34850,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,By God built over the sheer depth
34851,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,In which Space is begun;
34852,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"So high, that looking downward thence,"
34853,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,She scarce could see the sun.

34860,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Spins like a fretful midge.
34861,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34862,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34863,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"But in those tracts, with her, it was"
34864,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,The peace of utter light
34865,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And silence. For no breeze may stir
34866,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Along the steady flight
34867,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Of seraphim; no echo there,"
34868,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Beyond all depth or height.
34869,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34870,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Heard hardly, some of her new friends,"

34874,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"And the souls, mounting up to God,"
34875,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Went by her like thin flames.
34876,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34877,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"And still she bow’d herself, and stoop’d"
34878,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Into the vast waste calm;
34879,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Till her bosom’s pressure must have made
34880,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"The bar she lean’d on warm,"
34881,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And the lilies lay as if asleep
34882,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Along her bended arm.
34883,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34884,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw"
34885,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Time, like a pulse, shake fierce"
34886,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove,"
34887,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"In that steep gulf, to pierce"
34888,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"The swarm; and then she spoke, as when"
34889,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,The stars sang in their spheres.
34890,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34891,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"‘I wish that he were come to me,"
34892,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"For he will come,’ she said."
34893,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,‘Have I not pray’d in solemn Heaven?
34894,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"On earth, has he not pray’d?"
34895,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Are not two prayers a perfect strength?

34901,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"I’ll take his hand, and go with him"
34902,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"To the deep wells of light,"
34903,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And we will step down as to a stream
34904,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And bathe there in God’s sight.
34905,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34906,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"‘We two will stand beside that shrine,"
34907,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Occult, withheld, untrod,"
34908,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Whose lamps tremble continually
34909,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,With prayer sent up to God;

34912,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34913,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,‘We two will lie i’ the shadow of
34914,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,That living mystic tree

34916,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Sometimes is felt to be,"
34917,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,While every leaf that His plumes touch
34918,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Saith His name audibly.
34919,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,

34922,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,The songs I sing here; which his mouth
34923,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Shall pause in, hush’d and slow,"
34924,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Finding some knowledge at each pause,"
34925,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And some new thing to know.’
34926,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34927,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,(Alas! to _her_ wise simple mind
34928,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,These things were all but known
34929,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Before: they trembled on her sense,--"
34930,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Her voice had caught their tone.
34931,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Alas for lonely Heaven! Alas
34932,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,For life wrung out alone!
34933,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34934,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34935,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Alas, and though the end were reach’d?..."
34936,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Was _thy_ part understood
34937,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Or borne in trust? And for her sake
34938,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Shall this too be found good?--
34939,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,May the close lips that knew not prayer
34940,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Praise ever, though they would?)"
34941,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34942,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"‘We two,’ she said, ‘will seek the groves"
34943,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Where the lady Mary is,"
34944,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"With her five handmaidens, whose names"
34945,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Are five sweet symphonies:--

34951,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Into the fine cloth, white like flame,"
34952,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Weaving the golden thread,"
34953,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,To fashion the birth-robes for them
34954,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Who are just born, being dead."
34955,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34956,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"‘He shall fear, haply, and be dumb."
34957,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Then I will lay my cheek

34959,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Not once abash’d or weak:

34966,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Bow’d with their aureoles:
34967,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"And Angels, meeting us, shall sing"
34968,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,To their citherns and citoles.
34969,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34970,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34971,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,‘There will I ask of Christ the Lord

34984,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34985,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"She gazed, and listen’d, and then said,"
34986,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Less sad of speech than mild,--"
34987,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,‘All this is when he comes.’ She ceased:
34988,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"The light thrill’d past her, fill’d"
34989,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"With Angels, in strong level lapse."
34990,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"Her eyes pray’d, and she smiled."
34991,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,
34992,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,(I saw her smile.) But soon their flight
34993,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,Was vague ’mid the poised spheres.
34994,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,And then she cast her arms along
34995,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"The golden barriers,"
34996,DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI,"And laid her face between her hands,"

36740,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Be the gift of it free;
36741,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Not as servant to lord, nor as master to slave, shalt thou give thee to me."
36742,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36743,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"O children of banishment,"
36744,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Souls overcast,"
36745,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Were the lights ye see vanish meant
36746,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Alway to last,"
36747,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Ye would know not the sun overshining the shadows and stars overpast.
36748,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36749,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,I that saw where ye trod
36750,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,The dim paths of the night
36751,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Set the shadow call’d God
36752,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In your skies to give light;
36753,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"But the morning of manhood is risen, and the shadowless soul is in sight."
36754,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36755,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,The tree many-rooted
36756,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,That swells to the sky
36757,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"With frondage red-fruited,"
36758,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,The life-tree am I;
36759,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In the buds of your lives is the sap of my leaves: ye shall live and not die.
36760,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36761,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,But the Gods of your fashion
36762,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"That take and that give,"
36763,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In their pity and passion
36764,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"That scourge and forgive,"
36765,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,They are worms that are bred in the bark that falls off; they shall die and not live.
36766,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36767,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,My own blood is what stanches
36768,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,The wounds in my bark;
36769,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Stars caught in my branches
36770,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Make day of the dark,"
36771,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And are worshipp’d as suns till the sunrise shall tread out their fires as a spark.
36772,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36773,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Where dead ages hide under
36774,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"The live roots of the tree,"
36775,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In my darkness the thunder
36776,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Makes utterance of me;
36777,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In the clash of my boughs with each other ye hear the waves sound of the sea.
36778,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36779,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"That noise is of Time,"
36780,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,As his feathers are spread
36781,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And his feet set to climb
36782,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Through the boughs overhead,"
36783,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"And my foliage rings round him and rustles, and branches are bent with his tread."
36784,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36785,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,The storm-winds of ages
36786,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Blow through me and cease,"
36787,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"The war-wind that rages,"
36788,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"The spring-wind of peace,"
36789,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Ere the breath of them roughen my tresses, ere one of my blossoms increase."
36790,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36791,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"All sounds of all changes,"
36792,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,All shadows and lights
36793,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,On the world’s mountain-ranges
36794,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"And stream-riven heights,"
36795,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Whose tongue is the wind’s tongue and language of storm-clouds on earth-shaking nights;
36796,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36797,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"All forms of all faces,"
36798,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,All works of all hands
36799,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In unsearchable places
36800,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Of time-stricken lands,"
36801,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"All death and all life, and all reigns and all ruins, drop through me as sands."
36802,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36803,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Though sore be my burden
36804,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"And more than ye know,"
36805,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And my growth have no guerdon
36806,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"But only to grow,"
36807,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Yet I fail not of growing for lightnings above me or deathworms below.
36808,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36809,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"These too have their part in me,"
36810,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,As I too in these;
36811,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Such fire is at heart in me,"
36812,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Such sap is this tree’s,"
36813,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Which hath in it all sounds and all secrets of infinite lands and of seas.
36814,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36815,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In the spring-colour’d hours
36816,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,When my mind was as May’s
36817,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,There brake forth of me flowers
36818,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"By centuries of days,"
36819,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Strong blossoms with perfume of manhood, shot out from my spirit as rays."
36820,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36821,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And the sound of them springing
36822,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And smell of their shoots
36823,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Were as warmth and sweet singing
36824,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And strength to my roots;
36825,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And the lives of my children made perfect with freedom of soul were my fruits.
36826,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36827,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,I bid you but be;
36828,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,I have need not of prayer;
36829,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,I have need of you free
36830,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,As your mouths of mine air;
36831,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"That my heart may be greater within me, beholding the fruits of me fair."
36832,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36833,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,More fair than strange fruit is
36834,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Of faiths ye espouse;
36835,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In me only the root is
36836,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,That blooms in your boughs;
36837,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Behold now your God that ye made you, to feed him with faith of your vows."
36838,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36839,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,In the darkening and whitening
36840,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Abysses adored,"
36841,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,With dayspring and lightning
36842,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"For lamp and for sword,"
36843,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"God thunders in heaven, and his angels are red with the wrath of the Lord."
36844,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36845,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"O my sons, O too dutiful"
36846,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Toward Gods not of me,"
36847,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Was not I enough beautiful?
36848,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Was it hard to be free?
36849,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"For behold, I am with you, am in you and of you; look forth now and see."
36850,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36851,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Lo, wing’d with world’s wonders,"
36852,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"With miracles shod,"
36853,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,With the fires of his thunders
36854,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"For raiment and rod,"
36855,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"God trembles in heaven, and his angels are white with the terror of God."
36856,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36857,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"For his twilight is come on him,"
36858,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,His anguish is here;
36859,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"And his spirits gaze dumb on him,"
36860,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Grown gray from his fear;
36861,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"And his hour taketh hold on him stricken, the last of his infinite year."
36862,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Thought made him and breaks him,"
36863,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Truth slays and forgives;
36864,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"But to you, as time takes him,"
36865,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"This new thing it gives,"
36866,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Even love, the belovèd Republic, that feeds upon freedom and lives."
36867,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36868,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"For truth only is living,"
36869,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Truth only is whole,"
36870,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,And the love of his giving
36871,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,Man’s polestar and pole;
36872,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Man, pulse of my centre, and fruit of my body, and seed of my soul."
36873,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,
36874,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,One birth of my bosom;
36875,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,One beam of mine eye;
36876,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,One topmost blossom
36877,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,That scales the sky;
36878,ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE,"Man, equal and one with me, man that is made of me, man that is I."

36884,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36885,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Shall I strew on thee rose or rue or laurel,"
36886,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Brother, on this that was the veil of thee?"
36887,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Or quiet sea-flower moulded by the sea,"
36888,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Or simplest growth of meadow-sweet or sorrel,"
36889,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Such as the summer-sleepy Dryads weave,"
36890,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Waked up by snow-soft sudden rains at eve?
36891,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Or wilt thou rather, as on earth before,"
36892,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Half-faded fiery blossoms, pale with heat"
36893,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And full of bitter summer, but more sweet"
36894,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),To thee than gleanings of a northern shore
36895,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Trod by no tropic feet?
36896,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36897,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),For always thee the fervid languid glories
36898,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Allured of heavier suns in mightier skies;
36899,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs
36900,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories,"
36901,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The barren kiss of piteous wave to wave
36902,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),That knows not where is that Leucadian grave
36903,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Which hides too deep the supreme head of song.
36904,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Ah, salt and sterile as her kisses were,"
36905,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear
36906,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Hither and thither, and vex and work her wrong,"
36907,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Blind gods that cannot spare.
36908,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36909,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thou sawest, in thine old singing season, brother,"
36910,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us:
36911,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Fierce loves, and lovely leaf-buds poisonous,"
36912,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Bare to thy subtler eye, but for none other"
36913,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime;
36914,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The hidden harvest of luxurious time,"
36915,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Sin without shape, and pleasure without speech;"
36916,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep
36917,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep;
36918,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And with each face thou sawest the shadow on each,"
36919,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Seeing as men sow men reap.
36920,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36921,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping,"
36922,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),That were athirst for sleep and no more life
36923,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And no more love, for peace and no more strife!"
36924,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Now the dim gods of death have in their keeping
36925,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Spirit and body and all the springs of song,"
36926,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Is it well now where love can do no wrong,"
36927,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang
36928,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Behind the unopening closure of her lips?
36929,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Is it not well where soul from body slips
36930,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And flesh from bone divides without a pang
36931,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),As dew from flower-bell drips?
36932,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36933,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),It is enough; the end and the beginning
36934,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Are one thing to thee, who art past the end."
36935,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O hand unclasp’d of unbeholden friend,"
36936,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"For thee no fruits to pluck, no palms for winning,"
36937,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"No triumph and no labour and no lust,"
36938,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Only dead yew-leaves and a little dust.
36939,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O quiet eyes wherein the light saith naught,"
36940,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Whereto the day is dumb, nor any night"
36941,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"With obscure finger silences your sight,"
36942,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought,"
36943,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Sleep, and have sleep for light."
36944,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36945,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Now all strange hours and all strange loves are over,"
36946,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet,"
36947,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet
36948,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Of some pale Titan-woman like a lover,"
36949,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Such as thy vision here solicited,"
36950,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Under the shadow of her fair vast head,"
36951,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The deep division of prodigious breasts,"
36952,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep,"
36953,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The weight of awful tresses that still keep
36954,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests
36955,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Where the wet hill-winds weep?
36956,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36957,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Hast thou found any likeness for thy vision?
36958,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what bloom,"
36959,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Hast thou found sown, what gather’d in the gloom?"
36960,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"What of despair, of rapture, of derision,"
36961,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"What of life is there, what of ill or good?"
36962,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood?
36963,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Does the dim ground grow any seed of ours,"
36964,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The faint fields quicken any terrene root,"
36965,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),In low lands where the sun and moon are mute
36966,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And all the stars keep silence? Are there flowers
36967,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"At all, or any fruit?"
36968,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36969,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Alas, but though my flying song flies after,"
36970,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O sweet strange elder singer, thy more fleet"
36971,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Singing, and footprints of thy fleeter feet,"
36972,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Some dim derision of mysterious laughter
36973,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"From the blind tongueless warders of the dead,"
36974,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Some gainless glimpse of Proserpine’s veil’d head,"
36975,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Some little sound of unregarded tears
36976,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Wept by effaced unprofitable eyes,"
36977,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs--
36978,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"These only, these the hearkening spirit hears,"
36979,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Sees only such things rise.
36980,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36981,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thou art far too far for wings of words to follow,"
36982,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Far too far off for thought or any prayer.
36983,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"What ails us with thee, who art wind and air?"
36984,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?
36985,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Yet with some fancy, yet with some desire,"
36986,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire,"
36987,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Our dreams pursue our dead and do not find.
36988,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Still, and more swift than they, the thin flame flies,"
36989,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The low light fails us in elusive skies,"
36990,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Still the foil’d earnest ear is deaf, and blind"
36991,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Are still the eluded eyes.
36992,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36993,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36994,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Not thee, O never thee, in all time’s changes,"
36995,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Not thee, but this the sound of thy sad soul,"
36996,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The shadow of thy swift spirit, this shut scroll"
36997,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"I lay my hand on, and not death estranges"
36998,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),My spirit from communion of thy song--
36999,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),These memories and these melodies that throng
37000,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Veil’d porches of a Muse funereal--
37001,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"These I salute, these touch, these clasp and fold"
37002,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"As though a hand were in my hand to hold,"
37003,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Or through mine ears a mourning musical
37004,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Of many mourners roll’d.
37005,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
37006,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"I among these, I also, in such station"
37007,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"As when the pyre was charr’d, and piled the sods."
37008,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And offering to the dead made, and their gods,"
37009,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The old mourners had, standing to make libation,"
37010,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"I stand, and to the Gods and to the dead"
37011,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Do reverence without prayer or praise, and shed"
37012,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Offering to these unknown, the gods of gloom,"
37013,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And what of honey and spice my seed-lands bear,"
37014,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And what I may of fruits in this chill’d air,"
37015,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And lay, Orestes-like, across the tomb"
37016,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),A curl of sever’d hair.
37017,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
37018,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"But by no hand nor any treason stricken,"
37019,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Not like the low-lying head of Him, the King,"
37020,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The flame that made of Troy a ruinous thing,"
37021,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Thou liest and on this dust no tears could quicken.
37022,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear
37023,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Fall tear by sweet imperishable tear
37024,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Down the opening leaves of holy poets’ pages.
37025,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thee not Orestes, not Electra mourns;"
37026,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),But bending us-ward with memorial urns
37027,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The most high Muses that fulfil all ages
37028,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Weep, and our God’s heart yearns."
37029,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
37030,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"For, sparing of his sacred strength, not often"
37031,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Among us darkling here the lord of light
37032,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Makes manifest his music and his might
37033,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),In hearts that open and in lips that soften
37034,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),With the soft flame and heat of songs that shine.
37035,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thy lips indeed he touch’d with bitter wine,"
37036,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And nourish’d them indeed with bitter bread;
37037,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Yet surely from his hand thy soul’s food came,"
37038,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The fire that scarr’d thy spirit at his flame
37039,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Was lighted, and thine hungering heart he fed"
37040,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Who feeds our hearts with fame.
37041,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
37042,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Therefore he too now at thy soul’s sunsetting,"
37043,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"God of all suns and songs, he too bends down"
37044,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"To mix his laurel with thy cypress crown,"
37045,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And save thy dust from blame and from forgetting.
37046,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Therefore he too, seeing all thou wert and art,"
37047,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Compassionate, with sad and sacred heart,"

37721,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And three with a new song’s measure

37735,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37736,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"I made another garden, yea,"
37737,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,For my new Love:
37738,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,I left the dead rose where it lay
37739,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And set the new above.
37740,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Why did my Summer not begin?
37741,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Why did my heart not haste?
37742,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"My old Love came and walk’d therein,"
37743,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And laid the garden waste.
37744,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37745,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"She enter’d with her weary smile,"
37746,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Just as of old;
37747,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,She look’d around a little while
37748,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And shiver’d with the cold:
37749,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Her passing touch was death to all,"
37750,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Her passing look a blight;
37751,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"She made the white rose-petals fall,"
37752,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And turn’d the red rose white.
37753,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37754,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Her pale robe clinging to the grass
37755,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Seem’d like a snake
37756,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"That bit the grass and ground, alas!"
37757,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And a sad trail did make.
37758,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"She went up slowly to the gate,"
37759,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"And then, just as of yore,"
37760,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,She turn’d back at the last to wait
37761,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And say farewell once more.

37768,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"To-day and to-night and to-morrow,"
37769,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And maybe for months and for years;
37770,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,You shall come with a heart that is bursting
37771,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,For trouble and toiling and thirsting.
37772,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,You shall certainly come to the fountain
37773,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"At length,--to the Fountain of Tears."
37774,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37775,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Very peaceful the place is, and solely"
37776,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"For piteous lamenting and sighing,"
37777,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And those who come living or dying
37778,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Alike from their hopes and their fears;
37779,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Full of cypress-like shadows the place is,"
37780,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And statues that cover their faces:
37781,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,But out of the gloom springs the holy
37782,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And beautiful Fountain of Tears.
37783,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37784,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And it flows and it flows with a motion
37785,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"So gentle and lovely and listless,"
37786,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And murmurs a tune so resistless
37787,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,To him who hath suffer’d and hears--
37788,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"You shall surely--without a word spoken,"
37789,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Kneel down there and know your heart broken,"
37790,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And yield to the long-curb’d emotion
37791,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,That day by the Fountain of Tears.
37792,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37793,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"For it grows and it grows, as though leaping"
37794,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Up higher the more one is thinking;
37795,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And ever its tunes go on sinking
37796,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,More poignantly into the ears:
37797,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Yea, so blessèd and good seems that fountain,"
37798,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Reach’d after dry desert and mountain,"
37799,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,You shall fall down at length in your weeping
37800,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And bathe your sad face in the tears.
37801,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37802,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Then alas! while you lie there a season
37803,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"And sob between living and dying,"
37804,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And give up the land you were trying
37805,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,To find ’mid your hopes and your fears;
37806,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"--O the world shall come up and pass o’er you,"
37807,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Strong men shall not stay to care for you,"
37808,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Nor wonder indeed for what reason
37809,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Your way should seem harder than theirs.
37810,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37811,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"But perhaps, while you lie, never lifting"
37812,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Your cheek from the wet leaves it presses,"
37813,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Nor caring to raise your wet tresses
37814,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And look how the cold world appears--
37815,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,O perhaps the mere silences round you--
37816,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,All things in that place Grief hath found you--
37817,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Yea, e’en to the clouds o’er you drifting,"
37818,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,May soothe you somewhat through your tears.
37819,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37820,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"You may feel, when a falling leaf brushes"
37821,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Your face, as though some one had kiss’d you;"
37822,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Or think at least some one who miss’d you
37823,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Had sent you a thought,--if that cheers;"
37824,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Or a bird’s little song, faint and broken,"
37825,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,May pass for a tender word spoken:
37826,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"--Enough, while around you there rushes"
37827,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,That life-drowning torrent of tears.
37828,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,
37829,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"And the tears shall flow faster and faster,"
37830,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Brim over and baffle resistance,"
37831,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And roll down blear’d roads to each distance
37832,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Of past desolation and years;
37833,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"Till they cover the place of each sorrow,"
37834,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,And leave you no past and no morrow:

37840,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,"--O into what bosom, I wonder,"
37841,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,Is pour’d the whole sorrow of years?
37842,ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O’SHAUGHNESSY,For Eternity only seems keeping

38469,JOHN DAVIDSON,"The brave orb in state rose,"
38470,JOHN DAVIDSON,And crimson he shone first;
38471,JOHN DAVIDSON,While from the high vine
38472,JOHN DAVIDSON,"Of heaven the dawn burst,"
38473,JOHN DAVIDSON,Staining the great rose
38474,JOHN DAVIDSON,From sky-line to sky-line.
38475,JOHN DAVIDSON,
38476,JOHN DAVIDSON,The red rose of morn
38477,JOHN DAVIDSON,A white rose at noon turn’d;
38478,JOHN DAVIDSON,But at sunset reborn
38479,JOHN DAVIDSON,All red again soon burn’d.
38480,JOHN DAVIDSON,Then the pale rose of noonday
38481,JOHN DAVIDSON,"Rebloom’d in the night,"
38482,JOHN DAVIDSON,And spectrally white
38483,JOHN DAVIDSON,In the light
38484,JOHN DAVIDSON,Of the moon lay.
38485,JOHN DAVIDSON,
38486,JOHN DAVIDSON,But the vast rose
38487,JOHN DAVIDSON,"Was scentless,"
38488,JOHN DAVIDSON,And this is the reason:
38489,JOHN DAVIDSON,When the blast rose
38490,JOHN DAVIDSON,"Relentless,"
38491,JOHN DAVIDSON,And brought in due season
38492,JOHN DAVIDSON,"The snow rose, the last rose"
38493,JOHN DAVIDSON,"Congeal’d in its breath,"
38494,JOHN DAVIDSON,Then came with it treason;
38495,JOHN DAVIDSON,The traitor was Death.
38496,JOHN DAVIDSON,
38497,JOHN DAVIDSON,"In lee-valleys crowded,"
38498,JOHN DAVIDSON,The sheep and the birds
38499,JOHN DAVIDSON,Were frozen and shrouded
38500,JOHN DAVIDSON,In flights and in herds.
38501,JOHN DAVIDSON,In highways
38502,JOHN DAVIDSON,And byways
38503,JOHN DAVIDSON,The young and the old
38504,JOHN DAVIDSON,Were tortured and madden’d
38505,JOHN DAVIDSON,And kill’d by the cold.
38506,JOHN DAVIDSON,But many were gladden’d
38507,JOHN DAVIDSON,"By the beautiful last rose,"
38508,JOHN DAVIDSON,The blossom of no name
38509,JOHN DAVIDSON,"That came when the snow came,"
38510,JOHN DAVIDSON,In darkness unfurl’d--
38511,JOHN DAVIDSON,The wonderful vast rose
38512,JOHN DAVIDSON,That fill’d all the world.

38548,WILLIAM WATSON,
38549,WILLIAM WATSON,What is so sweet and dear
38550,WILLIAM WATSON,"As a prosperous morn in May,"
38551,WILLIAM WATSON,"The confident prime of the day,"

38553,WILLIAM WATSON,"When nothing that asks for bliss,"

38562,WILLIAM WATSON,"When the temporal lord of life,"
38563,WILLIAM WATSON,"Going his golden way,"
38564,WILLIAM WATSON,Had taken a wondrous maid to wife
38565,WILLIAM WATSON,That long had said him nay.
38566,WILLIAM WATSON,
38567,WILLIAM WATSON,"For of old the Sun, our sire,"
38568,WILLIAM WATSON,"Came wooing the mother of men,"

38570,WILLIAM WATSON,Vestal fire to his fire.
38571,WILLIAM WATSON,"Silent her bosom and coy,"
38572,WILLIAM WATSON,But the strong god sued and press’d;
38573,WILLIAM WATSON,And born of their starry nuptial joy
38574,WILLIAM WATSON,Are all that drink of her breast.
38575,WILLIAM WATSON,
38576,WILLIAM WATSON,"And the triumph of him that begot,"
38577,WILLIAM WATSON,"And the travail of her that bore,"
38578,WILLIAM WATSON,Behold they are evermore
38579,WILLIAM WATSON,As warp and weft in our lot.
38580,WILLIAM WATSON,"We are children of splendour and flame,"
38581,WILLIAM WATSON,"Of shuddering, also, and tears."
38582,WILLIAM WATSON,"Magnificent out of the dust we came,"
38583,WILLIAM WATSON,And abject from the Spheres.
38584,WILLIAM WATSON,
38585,WILLIAM WATSON,O bright irresistible lord!
38586,WILLIAM WATSON,"We are fruit of Earth’s womb, each one,"
38587,WILLIAM WATSON,"And fruit of thy loins, O Sun,"
38588,WILLIAM WATSON,Whence first was the seed outpour’d.
38589,WILLIAM WATSON,"To thee as our Father we bow,"
38590,WILLIAM WATSON,"Forbidden thy Father to see,"
38591,WILLIAM WATSON,"Who is older and greater than thou, as thou"

38593,WILLIAM WATSON,
38594,WILLIAM WATSON,Thou art but as a word of his speech;

38596,WILLIAM WATSON,Thou art brief as a glitter of sand
38597,WILLIAM WATSON,’Twixt tide and tide on his beach;
38598,WILLIAM WATSON,"Thou art less than a spark of his fire,"
38599,WILLIAM WATSON,Or a moment’s mood of his soul:

38947,WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,
38948,WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,"And bending down beside the glowing bars,"

38989,RUDYARD KIPLING,"I know, through Thee, the blame is mine."
38990,RUDYARD KIPLING,
38991,RUDYARD KIPLING,One instant’s toil to Thee denied
38992,RUDYARD KIPLING,Stands all Eternity’s offence;
38993,RUDYARD KIPLING,Of that I did with Thee to guide
38994,RUDYARD KIPLING,"To Thee, through Thee, be excellence."

39019,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39020,RUDYARD KIPLING,There’s a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield
39021,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the ricks stand gray to the sun,"
39022,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Singing:--‘Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover"
39023,RUDYARD KIPLING,And your English summer’s done.’
39024,RUDYARD KIPLING,You have heard the beat of the off-shore wind
39025,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the thresh of the deep-sea rain;
39026,RUDYARD KIPLING,You have heard the song--how long! how long!
39027,RUDYARD KIPLING,Pull out on the trail again!
39028,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39029,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Ha’ done with the Tents of Shem, dear lass,"
39030,RUDYARD KIPLING,"We’ve seen the seasons through,"
39031,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And it’s time to turn on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39032,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Pull out, pull out, on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new."
39033,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39034,RUDYARD KIPLING,"It’s North you may run to the rime-ring’d sun,"
39035,RUDYARD KIPLING,Or South to the blind Horn’s hate;
39036,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Or East all the way into Mississippi Bay,"
39037,RUDYARD KIPLING,Or West to the Golden Gate;
39038,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Where the blindest bluffs hold good, dear lass,"
39039,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the wildest tales are true,"
39040,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the men bulk big on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39041,RUDYARD KIPLING,And life runs large on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
39042,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39043,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39044,RUDYARD KIPLING,"The days are sick and cold, and the skies are gray and old,"
39045,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the twice-breathed airs blow damp;
39046,RUDYARD KIPLING,And I’d sell my tired soul for the bucking beam-sea roll
39047,RUDYARD KIPLING,Of a black Bilbao tramp;
39048,RUDYARD KIPLING,"With her load-line over her hatch, dear lass,"
39049,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And a drunken Dago crew,"
39050,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And her nose held down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39051,RUDYARD KIPLING,From Cadiz Bar on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
39052,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39053,RUDYARD KIPLING,"There be triple ways to take, of the eagle or the snake,"
39054,RUDYARD KIPLING,Or the way of a man with a maid;
39055,RUDYARD KIPLING,But the sweetest way to me is a ship’s upon the sea
39056,RUDYARD KIPLING,In the heel of the North-East Trade.
39057,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Can you hear the crash on her bows, dear lass,"
39058,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the drum of the racing screw,"
39059,RUDYARD KIPLING,"As she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39060,RUDYARD KIPLING,As she lifts and ’scends on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new?
39061,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39062,RUDYARD KIPLING,"See the shaking funnels roar, with the Peter at the fore,"
39063,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the fenders grind and heave,"
39064,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,"
39065,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the fall-rope whines through the sheave;
39066,RUDYARD KIPLING,"It’s ‘Gang-plank up and in,’ dear lass,"
39067,RUDYARD KIPLING,It’s ‘Hawsers warp her through!’
39068,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And it’s ‘All clear aft’ on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39069,RUDYARD KIPLING,We’re backing down on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
39070,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39071,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39072,RUDYARD KIPLING,"O the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,"
39073,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the sirens hoot their dread!
39074,RUDYARD KIPLING,When foot by foot we creep o’er the hueless viewless deep
39075,RUDYARD KIPLING,To the sob of the questing lead!
39076,RUDYARD KIPLING,"It’s down by the Lower Hope, dear lass,"
39077,RUDYARD KIPLING,"With the Gunfleet Sands in view,"
39078,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39079,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
39080,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39081,RUDYARD KIPLING,"O the blazing tropic night, when the wake’s a welt of light"
39082,RUDYARD KIPLING,"That holds the hot sky tame,"
39083,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powder’d floors
39084,RUDYARD KIPLING,Where the scared whale flukes in flame!
39085,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Her plates are scarr’d by the sun, dear lass,"
39086,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And her ropes are taut with the dew,"
39087,RUDYARD KIPLING,"For we’re booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39088,RUDYARD KIPLING,We’re sagging south on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
39089,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39090,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,"
39091,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the shouting seas drive by,"
39092,RUDYARD KIPLING,"And the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,"
39093,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the Southern Cross rides high!
39094,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,"
39095,RUDYARD KIPLING,That blaze in the velvet blue.
39096,RUDYARD KIPLING,"They’re all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39097,RUDYARD KIPLING,They’re God’s own guides on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
39098,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39099,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39100,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Fly forward, O my heart, from the Foreland to the Start--"
39101,RUDYARD KIPLING,"We’re steaming all too slow,"
39102,RUDYARD KIPLING,And it’s twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
39103,RUDYARD KIPLING,Where the trumpet-orchids blow!
39104,RUDYARD KIPLING,You have heard the call of the off-shore wind
39105,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the voice of the deep-sea rain;
39106,RUDYARD KIPLING,You have heard the song--how long! how long!
39107,RUDYARD KIPLING,Pull out on the trail again!
39108,RUDYARD KIPLING,
39109,RUDYARD KIPLING,"The Lord knows what we may find, dear lass,"
39110,RUDYARD KIPLING,And the deuce knows what we may do--
39111,RUDYARD KIPLING,"But we’re back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
39112,RUDYARD KIPLING,"We’re down, hull down on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new."

39346,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"The blood of the sun as he slaughter’d sank,"
39347,FRANCIS THOMPSON,And dipp’d its cup in the purpurate shine
39348,FRANCIS THOMPSON,When the eastern conduits ran with wine.
39349,FRANCIS THOMPSON,
39350,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Till it grew lethargied with fierce bliss,"
39351,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"And hot as a swinkèd gipsy is,"

39353,FRANCIS THOMPSON,With mouth wide a-pout for a sultry kiss.
39354,FRANCIS THOMPSON,
39355,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"A child and man paced side by side,"
39356,FRANCIS THOMPSON,Treading the skirts of eventide;
39357,FRANCIS THOMPSON,But between the clasp of his hand and hers
39358,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Lay, felt not, twenty wither’d years."
39359,FRANCIS THOMPSON,
39360,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"She turn’d, with the rout of her dusk South hair,"

39367,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"And joy, like a mew sea-rock’d apart,"
39368,FRANCIS THOMPSON,Toss’d on the wave of his troubled heart.
39369,FRANCIS THOMPSON,
39370,FRANCIS THOMPSON,
39371,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"For _he_ saw what she did not see,"
39372,FRANCIS THOMPSON,That--as kindled by its own fervency--

39378,FRANCIS THOMPSON,
39379,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"‘Was never such thing until this hour,’"

39384,FRANCIS THOMPSON,"‘Was never this thing to me,’ he said,"

39642,MARGARET L. WOODS,"Peace, Shepherd, peace! What boots it singing on?"
39643,MARGARET L. WOODS,"Since long ago grace-giving Phœbus died,"
39644,MARGARET L. WOODS,And all the train that loved the stream-bright side
39645,MARGARET L. WOODS,Of the poetic mount with him are gone
39646,MARGARET L. WOODS,"Beyond the shores of Styx and Acheron,"
39647,MARGARET L. WOODS,In unexplorèd realms of night to hide.
39648,MARGARET L. WOODS,The clouds that strew their shadows far and wide
39649,MARGARET L. WOODS,Are all of Heaven that visits Helicon.
39650,MARGARET L. WOODS,"Yet here, where never muse or god did haunt,"
39651,MARGARET L. WOODS,"Still may some nameless power of Nature stray,"
39652,MARGARET L. WOODS,Pleased with the reedy stream’s continual chant
39653,MARGARET L. WOODS,And purple pomp of these broad fields in May.
39654,MARGARET L. WOODS,"The shepherds meet him where he herds the kine,"
39655,MARGARET L. WOODS,And careless pass him by whose is the gift divine.

39666,R. D. BLACKMORE,
39667,R. D. BLACKMORE,"In the hour of death, after this life’s whim,"
39668,R. D. BLACKMORE,"When the heart beats low, and the eyes grow dim,"
39669,R. D. BLACKMORE,And pain has exhausted every limb--
39670,R. D. BLACKMORE,The lover of the Lord shall trust in Him.
39671,R. D. BLACKMORE,
39672,R. D. BLACKMORE,"When the will has forgotten the lifelong aim,"
39673,R. D. BLACKMORE,"And the mind can only disgrace its fame,"
39674,R. D. BLACKMORE,And a man is uncertain of his own name--
39675,R. D. BLACKMORE,The power of the Lord shall fill this frame.
39676,R. D. BLACKMORE,
39677,R. D. BLACKMORE,"When the last sigh is heaved, and the last tear shed,"
39678,R. D. BLACKMORE,"And the coffin is waiting beside the bed,"
39679,R. D. BLACKMORE,And the widow and child forsake the dead--
39680,R. D. BLACKMORE,The angel of the Lord shall lift this head.
39681,R. D. BLACKMORE,
39682,R. D. BLACKMORE,"For even the purest delight may pall,"
39683,R. D. BLACKMORE,"And power must fail, and the pride must fall,"
39684,R. D. BLACKMORE,And the love of the dearest friends grow small--
39685,R. D. BLACKMORE,But the glory of the Lord is all in all.
