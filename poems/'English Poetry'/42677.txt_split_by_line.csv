99,THE STONE,
100,THE STONE,"""And will you cut a stone for him,"
101,THE STONE,To set above his head?
102,THE STONE,And will you cut a stone for him--
103,THE STONE,"A stone for him?"" she said."
104,THE STONE,
105,THE STONE,"Three days before, a splintered rock"
106,THE STONE,Had struck her lover dead--
107,THE STONE,"Had struck him in the quarry dead,"
108,THE STONE,"Where, careless of the warning call,"
109,THE STONE,"He loitered, while the shot was fired--"
110,THE STONE,"A lively stripling, brave and tall,"
111,THE STONE,And sure of all his heart desired...
112,THE STONE,"A flash, a shock,"
113,THE STONE,A rumbling fall...
114,THE STONE,"And, broken ’neath the broken rock,"
115,THE STONE,"A lifeless heap, with face of clay,"
116,THE STONE,"And still as any stone he lay,"
117,THE STONE,With eyes that saw the end of all.
118,THE STONE,
119,THE STONE,I went to break the news to her:
120,THE STONE,And I could hear my own heart beat
121,THE STONE,With dread of what my lips might say
122,THE STONE,"But, some poor fool had sped before;"
123,THE STONE,"And, flinging wide her father’s door,"
124,THE STONE,"Had blurted out the news to her,"
125,THE STONE,"Had struck her lover dead for her,"
126,THE STONE,"Had struck the girl’s heart dead in her,"
127,THE STONE,"Had struck life, lifeless, at a word,"
128,THE STONE,And dropped it at her feet:
129,THE STONE,"Then hurried on his witless way,"
130,THE STONE,Scarce knowing she had heard.
131,THE STONE,
132,THE STONE,"And when I came, she stood, alone"
133,THE STONE,"A woman, turned to stone:"
134,THE STONE,"And, though no word at all she said,"
135,THE STONE,I knew that all was known.
136,THE STONE,
137,THE STONE,"Because her heart was dead,"
138,THE STONE,"She did not sigh nor moan,"
139,THE STONE,His mother wept:
140,THE STONE,She could not weep.
141,THE STONE,Her lover slept:
142,THE STONE,She could not sleep.
143,THE STONE,"Three days, three nights,"
144,THE STONE,She did not stir:
145,THE STONE,"Three days, three nights,"
146,THE STONE,"Were one to her,"
147,THE STONE,Who never closed her eyes
148,THE STONE,"From sunset to sunrise,"
149,THE STONE,From dawn to evenfall:
150,THE STONE,"Her tearless, staring eyes,"
151,THE STONE,"That, seeing naught, saw all."
152,THE STONE,
153,THE STONE,"The fourth night when I came from work,"
154,THE STONE,I found her at my door.
155,THE STONE,"""And will you cut a stone for him?"""
156,THE STONE,
157,THE STONE,She said: and spoke no more:
158,THE STONE,"But followed me, as I went in,"
159,THE STONE,And sank upon a chair;
160,THE STONE,"And fixed her grey eyes on my face,"
161,THE STONE,"With still, unseeing stare."
162,THE STONE,"And, as she waited patiently,"
163,THE STONE,I could not bear to feel
164,THE STONE,"Those still, grey eyes that followed me,"
165,THE STONE,"Those eyes that plucked the heart from me,"
166,THE STONE,Those eyes that sucked the breath from me
167,THE STONE,"And curdled the warm blood in me,"
168,THE STONE,"Those eyes that cut me to the bone,"
169,THE STONE,And pierced my marrow like cold steel.
170,THE STONE,
171,THE STONE,"And so I rose, and sought a stone;"
172,THE STONE,"And cut it, smooth and square:"
173,THE STONE,"And, as I worked, she sat and watched,"
174,THE STONE,"Beside me, in her chair."
175,THE STONE,"Night after night, by candlelight,"
176,THE STONE,I cut her lover’s name:
177,THE STONE,"Night after night, so still and white,"
178,THE STONE,And like a ghost she came;
179,THE STONE,"And sat beside me, in her chair;"
180,THE STONE,And watched with eyes aflame.
181,THE STONE,
182,THE STONE,She eyed each stroke;
183,THE STONE,And hardly stirred:
184,THE STONE,She never spoke
185,THE STONE,A single word:
186,THE STONE,And not a sound or murmur broke
187,THE STONE,"The quiet, save the mallet-stroke."
188,THE STONE,
189,THE STONE,"With still eyes ever on my hands,"
190,THE STONE,"With eyes that seemed to burn my hands,"
191,THE STONE,"My wincing, overwearied hands,"
192,THE STONE,"She watched, with bloodless lips apart,"
193,THE STONE,"And silent, indrawn breath:"
194,THE STONE,"And every stroke my chisel cut,"
195,THE STONE,Death cut still deeper in her heart:
196,THE STONE,"The two of us were chiselling,"
197,THE STONE,"Together, I and death."
198,THE STONE,
199,THE STONE,"And when at length the job was done,"
200,THE STONE,"And I had laid the mallet by,"
201,THE STONE,"As if, at last, her peace were won,"
202,THE STONE,"She breathed his name; and, with a sigh,"
203,THE STONE,Passed slowly through the open door:
204,THE STONE,And never crossed my threshold more.
205,THE STONE,
206,THE STONE,"Next night I laboured late, alone,"
207,THE STONE,To cut her name upon the stone.

212,THE WIFE,THE WIFE
213,THE WIFE,
214,THE WIFE,"That night, she dreamt that he had died,"
215,THE WIFE,"As they were sleeping, side by side:"
216,THE WIFE,"And she awakened in affright,"
217,THE WIFE,"To think of him, so cold and white:"
218,THE WIFE,"And, when she turned her eyes to him,"
219,THE WIFE,The tears of dream had made them dim;
220,THE WIFE,"And, for a while, she could not see"
221,THE WIFE,That he was sleeping quietly.
222,THE WIFE,"But, as she saw him lying there,"
223,THE WIFE,"The moonlight on his curly hair,"
224,THE WIFE,"With happy face and even breath,"
225,THE WIFE,Although she thought no more of death;
226,THE WIFE,And it was very good to rest
227,THE WIFE,"Her trembling hand on his calm breast,"
228,THE WIFE,And feel the warm and breathing life;
229,THE WIFE,And know that she was still his wife;
230,THE WIFE,"Yet, in his bosom’s easy stir,"
231,THE WIFE,She felt a something trouble her;
232,THE WIFE,"And wept again, she knew not why;"
233,THE WIFE,And thought it would be good to die--
234,THE WIFE,"To sink into the deep, sweet rest,"
235,THE WIFE,Her hand upon his quiet breast.
236,THE WIFE,
237,THE WIFE,"She slept: and when she woke again,"
238,THE WIFE,"A bird was at the window-pane,"
239,THE WIFE,"A wild-eyed bird, with wings of white"
240,THE WIFE,"That fluttered in the cold moonlight,"
241,THE WIFE,As though for very fear of night;
242,THE WIFE,"And flapped the pane, as if afraid:"
243,THE WIFE,"Yet, not a sound the white wings made."
244,THE WIFE,Her eyes met those beseeching eyes;
245,THE WIFE,"And then she felt she needs must rise,"
246,THE WIFE,"To let the poor, wild creature in"
247,THE WIFE,To find the rest it sought to win.
248,THE WIFE,She rose; and set the casement wide;
249,THE WIFE,And caught the murmur of the tide;
250,THE WIFE,"And saw, afar, the mounded graves"
251,THE WIFE,About the church beside the waves:
252,THE WIFE,The huddled headstones gleaming white
253,THE WIFE,And ghostly in the cold moonlight.
254,THE WIFE,
255,THE WIFE,The bird flew straightway to the bed;
256,THE WIFE,"And hovered o’er the husband’s head,"
257,THE WIFE,"And circled thrice above his head,"
258,THE WIFE,Three times above his dreaming head:
259,THE WIFE,"And, as she watched it, flying round"
260,THE WIFE,She wondered that it made no sound;
261,THE WIFE,"And, while she wondered, it was gone:"
262,THE WIFE,"And cold and white, the moonlight shone"
263,THE WIFE,"Upon her husband, sleeping there;"
264,THE WIFE,And turned to silver his gold hair;
265,THE WIFE,And paled like death his ruddy face.
266,THE WIFE,"Then, creeping back into her place,"
267,THE WIFE,She lay beside him in the bed:
268,THE WIFE,"But, if she closed her eyes, with dread"
269,THE WIFE,She saw that wild bird’s eyes that burned
270,THE WIFE,"Through her shut eyelids, though she turned"
271,THE WIFE,"Her blessings over in her heart,"
272,THE WIFE,"That peace might come: and with a start,"
273,THE WIFE,"If she but drowsed, or dreamt of rest,"
274,THE WIFE,She felt that wild beak in her breast.
275,THE WIFE,"So, wearying for the time to rise,"
276,THE WIFE,"She watched, till dawn was in the skies."
277,THE WIFE,
278,THE WIFE,Her husband woke: but not a word
279,THE WIFE,"She told him of the strange, white bird:"
280,THE WIFE,"But, as at breakfast-time, she took"
281,THE WIFE,The pan of porridge from the crook;
282,THE WIFE,And all was ready to begin;
283,THE WIFE,A neighbour gossip hurried in;
284,THE WIFE,"And told the news, that Phoebe Wright"
285,THE WIFE,Had died in childbirth in the night.
286,THE WIFE,"The husband neither spoke, nor stirred,"
287,THE WIFE,"But sat as one who, having heard,"
288,THE WIFE,May never hearken to a word
289,THE WIFE,From any living lips again;
290,THE WIFE,"And, heedless of the tongues of men,"
291,THE WIFE,"Hears, in a silence, dread and deep,"
292,THE WIFE,The dead folk talking in their sleep.
293,THE WIFE,His porridge stood till it was cold:
294,THE WIFE,"And as he sat, his face grew old;"
295,THE WIFE,"And all his yellow hair turned white,"
296,THE WIFE,"As it had looked to her last night,"
297,THE WIFE,When it was drenched with cold moonlight.
298,THE WIFE,And she knew all: yet never said
299,THE WIFE,A word to him about the dead;
300,THE WIFE,Or pestered him to take his meat:
301,THE WIFE,"But, sitting silent in her seat,"
302,THE WIFE,She left him quiet with his heart
303,THE WIFE,To thoughts in which she had no part;
304,THE WIFE,Until he rose to go about
305,THE WIFE,His daily work; and staggered out.
306,THE WIFE,"And all that day, her eyes were dim"
307,THE WIFE,That she had borne no child to him.
308,THE WIFE,
309,THE WIFE,"Days passed: and then, one evening late,"
310,THE WIFE,"As she came by the churchyard-gate,"
311,THE WIFE,"She saw him, near the new-made grave:"
312,THE WIFE,"And, with a lifted head and brave,"
313,THE WIFE,"She hurried home, lest he should know"
314,THE WIFE,That she had looked upon his woe.
315,THE WIFE,"And when they sat beside the fire,"
316,THE WIFE,Although it seemed he could not tire
317,THE WIFE,"Of gazing on the glowing coal,"
318,THE WIFE,And though a fire was in her soul;
319,THE WIFE,"She sat beside him with a smile,"
320,THE WIFE,"Lest he should look on her, the while,"
321,THE WIFE,And wonder what could make her sad
322,THE WIFE,When all the world but him was glad.
323,THE WIFE,"But, not a word to her he said:"
324,THE WIFE,And silently they went to bed.
325,THE WIFE,
326,THE WIFE,She never closed her eyes that night:
327,THE WIFE,"And she was stirring, ere the light;"
328,THE WIFE,"And while her husband lay at rest,"
329,THE WIFE,"She left his side, and quickly dressed;"
330,THE WIFE,"And stole downstairs, as though in fear"
331,THE WIFE,"That he should chance to wake, and hear."
332,THE WIFE,"And still the stars were burning bright,"
333,THE WIFE,As she passed out into the night;
334,THE WIFE,And all the dewy air was sweet
335,THE WIFE,"With flowers that grew about her feet,"
336,THE WIFE,"Where he, for her, when they were wed,"
337,THE WIFE,Had digged and sown a wallflower-bed:
338,THE WIFE,"And on the rich, deep, mellow scent"
339,THE WIFE,"A gust of memories came and went,"
340,THE WIFE,"As, dreaming of those old glad hours,"
341,THE WIFE,"She stooped to pluck a bunch of flowers,"
342,THE WIFE,To lay upon the flowerless grave
343,THE WIFE,That held his heart beside the wave.
344,THE WIFE,"Though, like a troop of ghosts in white,"
345,THE WIFE,"The headstones watched in cold starlight,"
346,THE WIFE,"As, by the dead girl’s grave she knelt,"
347,THE WIFE,No fear in her full heart she felt:
348,THE WIFE,"But hurried home, when she had laid"
349,THE WIFE,"Her offering on the turf, afraid"
350,THE WIFE,"That he should wake, and find her gone:"
351,THE WIFE,"And still the stars in heaven shone,"
352,THE WIFE,"When into bed again she crept,"
353,THE WIFE,"And lay beside him, while he slept"
354,THE WIFE,"And when day came, upon his hair,"
355,THE WIFE,"The warm light fell: and young and fair,"
356,THE WIFE,He looked again to her kind eyes
357,THE WIFE,That watched him till ’twas time to rise.
358,THE WIFE,
359,THE WIFE,"And, every day, as he went by"
360,THE WIFE,"The churchyard-gate with downcast eye,"
361,THE WIFE,He saw fresh blooms upon the grave
362,THE WIFE,That held his heart beside the wave:
363,THE WIFE,"And, wondering, he was glad to find"
364,THE WIFE,That any living soul was kind
365,THE WIFE,To that dead girl who died the death
366,THE WIFE,Of shame for his sake: and the breath
367,THE WIFE,"Of those fresh flowers to him was sweet,"
368,THE WIFE,"As he trudged home with laggard feet,"
369,THE WIFE,Still wondering who could be her friend.
370,THE WIFE,
371,THE WIFE,"He never knew, until the end,"
372,THE WIFE,"When, in the churchyard by the wave,"
373,THE WIFE,He stood beside another grave:
374,THE WIFE,"And, as the priest’s last words were said,"
375,THE WIFE,"He turned, and lifting up his head,"
376,THE WIFE,He saw the bunch of flowers was dead
377,THE WIFE,Upon the dead girl’s grave; and felt
378,THE WIFE,"The truth shoot through his heart, and melt"
379,THE WIFE,"The frost of icy bitterness,"
380,THE WIFE,And flood his heart with warm distress:
381,THE WIFE,"And, kneeling by his dead wife’s grave,"
382,THE WIFE,"To her, at last, her hour he gave."
383,THE WIFE,
384,THE WIFE,"That night, she dreamt he, too, had died,"
385,THE WIFE,"And they were sleeping, side by side."

390,THE MACHINE,THE MACHINE
391,THE MACHINE,
392,THE MACHINE,"Since Thursday he’d been working overtime,"
393,THE MACHINE,"With only three short hours for food and sleep,"
394,THE MACHINE,"When no sleep came, because of the dull beat"
395,THE MACHINE,Of his fagged brain; and he could scarcely eat.
396,THE MACHINE,"And now, on Saturday, when he was free,"
397,THE MACHINE,"And all his fellows hurried home to tea,"
398,THE MACHINE,He was so dazed that he could hardly keep
399,THE MACHINE,His hands from going through the pantomime
400,THE MACHINE,Of keeping-even sheets in his machine--
401,THE MACHINE,"The sleek machine that, day and night,"
402,THE MACHINE,"Fed with paper, virgin white,"
403,THE MACHINE,"Through those glaring, flaring hours"
404,THE MACHINE,"In the incandescent light,"
405,THE MACHINE,Printed children’s picture-books--
406,THE MACHINE,"Red and yellow, blue and green,"
407,THE MACHINE,"With sunny fields and running brooks,"
408,THE MACHINE,"Ships at sea, and golden sands,"
409,THE MACHINE,"Queer white towns in Eastern lands,"
410,THE MACHINE,Tossing palms on coral strands--
411,THE MACHINE,"Until at times the clank and whirr and click,"
412,THE MACHINE,And shimmer of white paper turned him sick;
413,THE MACHINE,"And though at first the colours made him glad,"
414,THE MACHINE,They soon were dancing in his brain like mad;
415,THE MACHINE,And kept on flaring through his burning head:
416,THE MACHINE,"Now, in a flash, the workshop, flaming red;"
417,THE MACHINE,Now blazing green; now staring blue;
418,THE MACHINE,And then the yellow glow too well he knew:
419,THE MACHINE,"Until the sleek machine, with roar and glare,"
420,THE MACHINE,Began to take him in a dazzling snare;
421,THE MACHINE,"When, fascinated, with a senseless stare,"
422,THE MACHINE,"It drew him slowly towards it, till his hair"
423,THE MACHINE,"Was caught betwixt the rollers; but his hand,"
424,THE MACHINE,"Almost before his brain could understand,"
425,THE MACHINE,Had clutched the lever; and the wheels were stopped
426,THE MACHINE,"Just in the nick of time; though now he dropped,"
427,THE MACHINE,Half-senseless on the littered workshop floor:
428,THE MACHINE,"And he’d lain dazed a minute there or more,"
429,THE MACHINE,When his machine-girl helped him to a seat.
430,THE MACHINE,"But soon again he was upon his feet,"
431,THE MACHINE,And tending that unsatisfied machine;
432,THE MACHINE,"And printing pictures, red and blue and green,"
433,THE MACHINE,Until again the green and blue and red
434,THE MACHINE,Went jigging in a riot through his head;
435,THE MACHINE,"And, wildest of the raging rout,"
436,THE MACHINE,"The blinding, screeching, racking yellow--"
437,THE MACHINE,A crazy devil of a fellow--
438,THE MACHINE,O’er all the others seemed to shout.
439,THE MACHINE,For hands must not be idle when the year
440,THE MACHINE,"Is getting through, and Christmas drawing near,"
441,THE MACHINE,With piles on piles of picture-books to print
442,THE MACHINE,For people who spend money without stint:
443,THE MACHINE,"And, while they’re paying down their liberal gold,"
444,THE MACHINE,"Guess little what is bought, and what is sold."
445,THE MACHINE,
446,THE MACHINE,"But he, at last, was free till Monday, free"
447,THE MACHINE,"To sleep, to eat, to dream, to sulk, to walk,"
448,THE MACHINE,"To laugh, to sing, to whistle, or to talk ..."
449,THE MACHINE,"If only, through his brain, unceasingly,"
450,THE MACHINE,"The wheels would not keep whirring, while the smell--"
451,THE MACHINE,The oily smell of thick and sticky glaze
452,THE MACHINE,"Clung to his nostrils, till ’twas hard to tell"
453,THE MACHINE,If he were really out in the fresh air;
454,THE MACHINE,"And still before his eyes, the blind, white glare,"
455,THE MACHINE,"And then the colours dancing in his head,"
456,THE MACHINE,"A maddening maze of yellow, blue and red."
457,THE MACHINE,"So, on he wandered in a kind of daze,"
458,THE MACHINE,Too racked with sleeplessness to think of bed
459,THE MACHINE,"Save as a hell, where you must toss and toss,"
460,THE MACHINE,With colours shooting in insane criss-cross
461,THE MACHINE,"Before wide, prickling, gritty, sleepless eyes."
462,THE MACHINE,
463,THE MACHINE,"But, as he walked along the darkening street,"
464,THE MACHINE,"Too tired to rest, and far too spent to eat,"
465,THE MACHINE,"The swish and patter of the passing feet,"
466,THE MACHINE,"The living, human murmur, and keen cries,"
467,THE MACHINE,"The deep, cool shadows of the coming night,"
468,THE MACHINE,About quick-kindling jets of clustered light;
469,THE MACHINE,"And the fresh breathing of the rain-washed air,"
470,THE MACHINE,Brought something of sweet healing to his mind;
471,THE MACHINE,"And, though he trailed along as if half-blind,"
472,THE MACHINE,Yet often on the pavement he would stop
473,THE MACHINE,To gaze at goods displayed within a shop;
474,THE MACHINE,"And wonder, in a dull and lifeless way,"
475,THE MACHINE,"What they had cost, and who’d the price to pay."
476,THE MACHINE,"But those two kinds of shop which, as a boy,"
477,THE MACHINE,"Had been to him a never-failing joy,"
478,THE MACHINE,"The bookshop and the fruitshop, he passed by,"
479,THE MACHINE,As if their colours seared his wincing eye;
480,THE MACHINE,"For still he feared the yellow, blue and red"
481,THE MACHINE,Would start that devils’ dancing in his head.
482,THE MACHINE,"And soon, through throngs of people, almost gay"
483,THE MACHINE,"To be let loose from work, he pushed his way;"
484,THE MACHINE,And ripples of their careless laughter stole
485,THE MACHINE,"Like waves of cooling waters through his soul,"
486,THE MACHINE,"While sometimes he would lift his aching eyes,"
487,THE MACHINE,"And see a child’s face, flushed with proud surprise,"
488,THE MACHINE,"As, gripping both its parents’ hands quite tight,"
489,THE MACHINE,"It found itself in fairylands of light,"
490,THE MACHINE,Walking with grown-up people through the night:
491,THE MACHINE,"Then, turning, with a shudder he would see"
492,THE MACHINE,"Poor painted faces, leering frightfully,"
493,THE MACHINE,And so drop back from heaven again to hell.
494,THE MACHINE,
495,THE MACHINE,"And then, somehow, though how he scarce could tell,"
496,THE MACHINE,"He found that he was walking through the throng,"
497,THE MACHINE,"Quite happy, with a young girl at his side--"
498,THE MACHINE,A young girl apple-cheeked and eager-eyed;
499,THE MACHINE,"And her frank, friendly chatter seemed a song"
500,THE MACHINE,"To him, who ne’er till now had heard life sing."
501,THE MACHINE,"And youth within him kindled quick and strong,"
502,THE MACHINE,As he drank in that careless chattering.
503,THE MACHINE,And now she told to him how she had come
504,THE MACHINE,From some far Northern Isle to earn her bread;
505,THE MACHINE,"And in a stuffy office all day long,"
506,THE MACHINE,"In shiny ledgers, with a splitting head,"
507,THE MACHINE,"She added dazzling figures till they danced,"
508,THE MACHINE,"And tied themselves in wriggling knots, and pranced,"
509,THE MACHINE,And scrambled helter-skelter o’er the page:
510,THE MACHINE,"And, though it seemed already quite an age"
511,THE MACHINE,"Since she had left her home, from end to end"
512,THE MACHINE,Of this big town she had not any friend:
513,THE MACHINE,"At times she almost dreaded she’d go dumb,"
514,THE MACHINE,"With not a soul to speak to; for, at home"
515,THE MACHINE,"In her own Island, she knew everyone..."
516,THE MACHINE,"No strangers there! save when the tinkers came,"
517,THE MACHINE,With pots and pans aglinting in the sun--
518,THE MACHINE,"You saw the tin far off, like glancing flame,"
519,THE MACHINE,As all about the Island they would roam....
520,THE MACHINE,"Then, of themselves at home, there were six brothers,"
521,THE MACHINE,"Five sisters, with herself, besides the others--"
522,THE MACHINE,"Two homeless babes, whom, having lost their mothers,"
523,THE MACHINE,Her mother’d taken in among her own...
524,THE MACHINE,And she in all her life had hardly known
525,THE MACHINE,Her mother with no baby at her breast...
526,THE MACHINE,She’d always sing to hush them all to sleep;
527,THE MACHINE,"And sang, too, for the dancing, sang to keep"
528,THE MACHINE,"The feet in time and tune; and still sang best,"
529,THE MACHINE,Clean best of all the singers of the Isle.
530,THE MACHINE,"And as she talked of home, he saw her smile,"
531,THE MACHINE,"With happy, far-off gaze; and then as though"
532,THE MACHINE,In wonder how she’d come to chatter so
533,THE MACHINE,"To this pale, grave-eyed boy, she paused, half shy;"
534,THE MACHINE,"And then she laughed, with laughter clear and true;"
535,THE MACHINE,"And looked into his eyes; and he laughed too,"
536,THE MACHINE,"And they were happy, hardly knowing why."
537,THE MACHINE,
538,THE MACHINE,"And now he told her of his life, and how"
539,THE MACHINE,"He too had been nigh friendless, until now."
540,THE MACHINE,And soon he talked to her about his work;
541,THE MACHINE,"But, when he spoke of it, as with a jerk,"
542,THE MACHINE,The light dropped from his eyes.  He seemed to slip
543,THE MACHINE,Once more in the machine’s relentless grip;
544,THE MACHINE,And hear again the clank and whirr and click;
545,THE MACHINE,And see the dancing colours and the glare;
546,THE MACHINE,Until his dizzy brain again turned sick:
547,THE MACHINE,"And seeing him look round with vacant air,"
548,THE MACHINE,Fierce pity cut her to the very quick;
549,THE MACHINE,"And as her eyes with keen distress were filled,"
550,THE MACHINE,She touched his hand; and soon her kind touch stilled
551,THE MACHINE,"The agony: and so, to bring him ease,"
552,THE MACHINE,"She told more of that Isle in Northern seas,"
553,THE MACHINE,"Where she was born, and of the folks at home:"
554,THE MACHINE,"And how, all night, you heard the wash of foam..."
555,THE MACHINE,"Sometimes, on stormy nights, against the pane"
556,THE MACHINE,The sousing spray would rattle just like rain;
557,THE MACHINE,And oft the high-tides scoured the threshold clean...
558,THE MACHINE,
559,THE MACHINE,"And, as she talked, he saw the sea-light glint"
560,THE MACHINE,In her dark eyes: and then the sleek machine
561,THE MACHINE,Lost hold on him at last; and ceased to print:
562,THE MACHINE,"And in his eyes there sprang a kindred light,"
563,THE MACHINE,"As, hand in hand, they wandered through the night."
564,THE MACHINE,

567,THE MACHINE,
568,THE LODESTAR,THE LODESTAR
569,THE LODESTAR,
570,THE LODESTAR,"From hag to hag, o’er miles of quaking moss,"
571,THE LODESTAR,"Benighted, in an unknown countryside,"
572,THE LODESTAR,"Among gaunt hills, the stars my only guide;"
573,THE LODESTAR,"Bewildered by peat-waters, black and deep,"
574,THE LODESTAR,Wherein the mocking stars swam; spent for sleep;
575,THE LODESTAR,O’er-wearied by long trudging; at a loss
576,THE LODESTAR,Which way to turn for shelter from the night;
577,THE LODESTAR,"I struggled on, until, my head grown light"
578,THE LODESTAR,"From utter weariness, I almost sank"
579,THE LODESTAR,"To rest among the tussocks, soft and dank,"
580,THE LODESTAR,"Drowsing, half-dazed, and murmuring: it were best"
581,THE LODESTAR,"To stray no further: but, to lie at rest,"
582,THE LODESTAR,"Beneath the cold, white stars, for evermore:"
583,THE LODESTAR,"When, suddenly, I came across"
584,THE LODESTAR,A runnel oozing from the moss;
585,THE LODESTAR,"And knew that, if I followed where it led,"
586,THE LODESTAR,"’Twould bring me to a valley, in the end,"
587,THE LODESTAR,"Where there’d be houses, and, perhaps, a bed."
588,THE LODESTAR,
589,THE LODESTAR,"And so, the little runnel was my friend;"
590,THE LODESTAR,"And as I walked beside its path, at first"
591,THE LODESTAR,It kept a friendly silence; then it burst
592,THE LODESTAR,"Into a friendly singing, as it rambled,"
593,THE LODESTAR,"Among big boulders, down a craggy steep,"
594,THE LODESTAR,"’Mid bracken, nigh breast-deep,"
595,THE LODESTAR,"Through which I scrambled,"
596,THE LODESTAR,"Half-blind and numb for sleep,"
597,THE LODESTAR,Until it seemed that I could strive no more:
598,THE LODESTAR,"When, startled by a startled sheep,"
599,THE LODESTAR,"Looking down, I saw a track--"
600,THE LODESTAR,"A stony trackway, dimly white,"
601,THE LODESTAR,"Disappearing in the night,"
602,THE LODESTAR,"Across a waste of heather, burnt and black."
603,THE LODESTAR,"And so, I took it, mumbling o’er and o’er,"
604,THE LODESTAR,"In witlessness of weariness,"
605,THE LODESTAR,And featherheaded foolishness:
606,THE LODESTAR,"A track must lead, at sometime, to a door."
607,THE LODESTAR,
608,THE LODESTAR,"And, trudging to this senseless tune,"
609,THE LODESTAR,"That kept on drumming in my head,"
610,THE LODESTAR,I followed where the pathway led;
611,THE LODESTAR,"But, all too soon,"
612,THE LODESTAR,"It left the ling, and nigh was lost"
613,THE LODESTAR,Among the bent that glimmered grey
614,THE LODESTAR,About my sore-bewildered way:
615,THE LODESTAR,"But when, at length, it crossed"
616,THE LODESTAR,"A brawling burn, I saw, afar,"
617,THE LODESTAR,A cottage window light--
618,THE LODESTAR,"A star, but no cold, heavenly star--"
619,THE LODESTAR,A warm red star of welcome in the night.
620,THE LODESTAR,
621,THE LODESTAR,"Far off, it burned upon the black hillside,"
622,THE LODESTAR,Sole star of earth in all that waste so wide:
623,THE LODESTAR,"A little human lantern in the night,"
624,THE LODESTAR,"Yet, more to me than all the bright"
625,THE LODESTAR,"Unfriendly stars of heaven, so cold and white."
626,THE LODESTAR,
627,THE LODESTAR,"And, as it dimly shone,"
628,THE LODESTAR,Though towards it I could only go
629,THE LODESTAR,"With stumbling step and slow,"
630,THE LODESTAR,It quickened in my heart a kindred glow;
631,THE LODESTAR,And seemed to draw me on
632,THE LODESTAR,"That last rough mile or so,"
633,THE LODESTAR,"Now seen, now hidden, when the track"
634,THE LODESTAR,"Dipped down into a slack,"
635,THE LODESTAR,And all the earth again was black:
636,THE LODESTAR,"And from the unseen fern,"
637,THE LODESTAR,"Grey ghost of all bewildered things,"
638,THE LODESTAR,"An owl brushed by me on unrustling wings,"
639,THE LODESTAR,"And gave me quite a turn,"
640,THE LODESTAR,And sent a shiver through my hair.
641,THE LODESTAR,
642,THE LODESTAR,"Then, again, more fair"
643,THE LODESTAR,"Flashed the friendly light,"
644,THE LODESTAR,"Beckoning through the night,"
645,THE LODESTAR,"A golden, glowing square,"
646,THE LODESTAR,"Growing big and clearer,"
647,THE LODESTAR,"As I drew slowly nearer,"
648,THE LODESTAR,"With eager, stumbling feet;"
649,THE LODESTAR,And snuffed the homely reek of peat:
650,THE LODESTAR,"And saw, above me, lone and high,"
651,THE LODESTAR,"A cottage, dark against the sky--"
652,THE LODESTAR,A candle shining on the window-sill.
653,THE LODESTAR,
654,THE LODESTAR,"With thankful heart, I climbed the hill;"
655,THE LODESTAR,"And stood, at last, before"
656,THE LODESTAR,"The dark and unknown door,"
657,THE LODESTAR,"Wondering if food and shelter lay behind,"
658,THE LODESTAR,"And what the welcome I should find,"
659,THE LODESTAR,"Whether kindly, or unkind:"
660,THE LODESTAR,"But I had scarcely knocked, to learn my fate,"
661,THE LODESTAR,"When the latch lifted, and the door swung wide"
662,THE LODESTAR,"On creaking hinges; and I saw, inside,"
663,THE LODESTAR,"A frail old woman, very worn and white,"
664,THE LODESTAR,"Her body all atremble in the light,"
665,THE LODESTAR,"Who gazed with strange, still eyes into the night,"
666,THE LODESTAR,"As though she did not see me, but looked straight"
667,THE LODESTAR,"Beyond me, to some unforgotten past:"
668,THE LODESTAR,"And I was startled when she said at last,"
669,THE LODESTAR,"With strange, still voice: ""You’re welcome, though you’re late."""
670,THE LODESTAR,
671,THE LODESTAR,"And then, an old man, nodding in a chair,"
672,THE LODESTAR,"Beside the fire, awoke with sleepy stare;"
673,THE LODESTAR,"And rose in haste; and led her to a seat,"
674,THE LODESTAR,Beside the cosy hearth of glowing peat;
675,THE LODESTAR,"And muttered to me, as he took her hand:"
676,THE LODESTAR,"""It’s queer, it’s queer, that she, to-night, should stand,"
677,THE LODESTAR,Who has not stood alone for fifteen year.
678,THE LODESTAR,"Though I heard nothing, she was quick to hear."
679,THE LODESTAR,"I must have dozed; but she has been awake,"
680,THE LODESTAR,And listening for your footstep since daybreak:
681,THE LODESTAR,For she was certain you would come to-day;
682,THE LODESTAR,"Aye, she was sure, for all that I could say:"
683,THE LODESTAR,"Talk as I might, she would not go to bed,"
684,THE LODESTAR,Till you should come.  Your supper has been spread
685,THE LODESTAR,"This long while: you’ll be ready for your meat."""
686,THE LODESTAR,With that he beckoned me to take a seat
687,THE LODESTAR,"Before the table, lifting from the crook"
688,THE LODESTAR,"The singing kettle; while, with far-off look,"
689,THE LODESTAR,"As though she neither saw nor heard,"
690,THE LODESTAR,His wife sat gazing at the glowing peat.
691,THE LODESTAR,
692,THE LODESTAR,"So, wondering sorely, I sat down to eat;"
693,THE LODESTAR,"And yet she neither spoke, nor stirred;"
694,THE LODESTAR,"But in her high-backed chair sat bolt-upright,"
695,THE LODESTAR,"With still grey eyes; and tumbled hair, as white"
696,THE LODESTAR,"As fairy-cotton, straggling o’er her brow,"
697,THE LODESTAR,And hung in wisps about her wasted cheek.
698,THE LODESTAR,"But, when I’d finished, and drew near the fire,"
699,THE LODESTAR,"She suddenly turned round to speak,"
700,THE LODESTAR,Her old eyes kindling with a tense desire.
701,THE LODESTAR,"Her words came tremblingly: ""You’ll tell me now"
702,THE LODESTAR,"What news you bring of him, my son?""  Amazed,"
703,THE LODESTAR,I met that searching and love-famished look:
704,THE LODESTAR,"And then the old man, seeing I was dazed,"
705,THE LODESTAR,Made shift to swing aside the kettle crook;
706,THE LODESTAR,And muttered in my ear:
707,THE LODESTAR,"""John Netherton, his name:"" and as I gazed"
708,THE LODESTAR,"Into the peat that broke in clear blue flame,"
709,THE LODESTAR,Remembrance flashed upon me with the name;
710,THE LODESTAR,And I slipped back in memory twenty year--
711,THE LODESTAR,Back to the fo’c’sle of a villainous boat;
712,THE LODESTAR,"And once again in that hot hell I lay,"
713,THE LODESTAR,"Watching the smoky lantern duck and sway,"
714,THE LODESTAR,As though in steamy stench it kept afloat...
715,THE LODESTAR,The fiery fangs of fever at my throat;
716,THE LODESTAR,"And my poor broken arm, ill-set,"
717,THE LODESTAR,A bar of white-hot iron at my side:
718,THE LODESTAR,"And, as I lay, with staring eyes pricked wide,"
719,THE LODESTAR,"Throughout eternities of agony,"
720,THE LODESTAR,"I saw a big, black shadow stoop o’er me;"
721,THE LODESTAR,"And felt a cool hand touch my brow, and wet"
722,THE LODESTAR,My cracking lips: and sank in healing sleep:
723,THE LODESTAR,"And when I rose from that unfathomed deep,"
724,THE LODESTAR,I saw the youngest of that rascal crew
725,THE LODESTAR,Beside my bunk; and heard his name; and knew
726,THE LODESTAR,"’Twas he who’d brought me ease: but, soon, ashore,"
727,THE LODESTAR,We parted; and I never saw him more;
728,THE LODESTAR,"Though, some while after, in another place,"
729,THE LODESTAR,I heard he’d perished in a drunken brawl...
730,THE LODESTAR,
731,THE LODESTAR,"And now the old man touched me, to recall"
732,THE LODESTAR,My wandering thoughts; and breathed again the name
733,THE LODESTAR,And I looked up into the mother’s face
734,THE LODESTAR,That burned before me with grey eyes aflame.
735,THE LODESTAR,And so I told her how I’d met her son;
736,THE LODESTAR,And of the kindly things that he had done.
737,THE LODESTAR,And as I spoke her quivering spirit drank
738,THE LODESTAR,The news that it had thirsted for so long;
739,THE LODESTAR,And for a flashing moment gay and strong
740,THE LODESTAR,"Life flamed in her old eyes, then slowly sank."
741,THE LODESTAR,"""And he was happy when you saw him last?"""
742,THE LODESTAR,"She asked: and I was glad to answer, ""Yes."""
743,THE LODESTAR,"Then all sat dreaming without stir or sound,"
744,THE LODESTAR,"As gradually she sank into the past,"
745,THE LODESTAR,"With eyes that looked beyond all happiness,"
746,THE LODESTAR,"Beyond all earthly trouble and distress,"
747,THE LODESTAR,Into some other world than ours.  The thread
748,THE LODESTAR,That long had held the straining life earthbound
749,THE LODESTAR,Was loosed at last: her eyes grew dark: her head
750,THE LODESTAR,Drooped slowly on her breast; and she was dead.
751,THE LODESTAR,
752,THE LODESTAR,"The old man at her side spoke not a word,"
753,THE LODESTAR,"As we arose, and bore her to the bed;"
754,THE LODESTAR,"And laid her on the clean, white quilt at rest"
755,THE LODESTAR,With calm hands folded on her quiet breast.
756,THE LODESTAR,"And, hour by hour, he hardly even stirred,"
757,THE LODESTAR,Crouching beside me in the ingle-seat;
758,THE LODESTAR,"And staring, staring at the still red glow:"
759,THE LODESTAR,"But, only when the fire was burning low,"
760,THE LODESTAR,He rose to bring fresh peat;
761,THE LODESTAR,And muttered with dull voice and slow:
762,THE LODESTAR,"""This fire has ne’er burned out through all these years--"
763,THE LODESTAR,Not since the hearthstone first was set--
764,THE LODESTAR,And that is nigh two hundred year ago.
765,THE LODESTAR,My father’s father built this house; and I...
766,THE LODESTAR,"I thought my son..."" and then he gave a sigh;"
767,THE LODESTAR,"And as he stooped, his wizened cheek was wet"
768,THE LODESTAR,With slowly-trickling tears.
769,THE LODESTAR,"And now he hearkened, while an owl’s keen cry"
770,THE LODESTAR,"Sang through the silence, as it fluttered nigh"
771,THE LODESTAR,"The cottage-window, dazzled by the light,"
772,THE LODESTAR,"Then back, with fainter hootings, into night."
773,THE LODESTAR,
774,THE LODESTAR,"But, when the fresh peats broke into a blaze,"
775,THE LODESTAR,"He watched it with a steady, dry-eyed gaze;"
776,THE LODESTAR,"And spoke once more: ""And he, dead, too!"
777,THE LODESTAR,"You did not tell her; but I knew ... I knew!"""
778,THE LODESTAR,
779,THE LODESTAR,And now came all the tale of their distress:
780,THE LODESTAR,"Their only son, in wanton waywardness,"
781,THE LODESTAR,"Had left them, nearly thirty year ago;"
782,THE LODESTAR,And they had never had a word from him
783,THE LODESTAR,In all that time... the reckless blow
784,THE LODESTAR,Of his unkindness struck his mother low...
785,THE LODESTAR,"Her hair, as ruddy as the fern"
786,THE LODESTAR,"In late September by a moorland burn,"
787,THE LODESTAR,Had shrivelled rimy-white
788,THE LODESTAR,In one short summer’s night:
789,THE LODESTAR,"And they had looked, and looked for his return..."
790,THE LODESTAR,"His mother set for him at every meal,"
791,THE LODESTAR,And kept his bed well-aired ... the knife and fork
792,THE LODESTAR,"I’d used were John’s ... but, as all hope grew dim,"
793,THE LODESTAR,"She sickened, dwindling feebler every day:"
794,THE LODESTAR,"Though, when it seemed that she must pass away,"
795,THE LODESTAR,"She grew more confident that, ere she passed,"
796,THE LODESTAR,"A stranger would bring news to her, at last,"
797,THE LODESTAR,"Of her lost son.  ""And when I woke in bed"
798,THE LODESTAR,"Beside her, as the dawn was burning red,"
799,THE LODESTAR,"She turned to me, with sleepless eyes, and said:"
800,THE LODESTAR,"’The news will come, to-day.’"""
801,THE LODESTAR,
802,THE LODESTAR,"He spoke no more: and silent in my seat,"
803,THE LODESTAR,"With burning eyes upon the burning peat,"
804,THE LODESTAR,I pondered on this strangest of strange things
805,THE LODESTAR,That had befallen in my vagrant life:
806,THE LODESTAR,"And how, at last, my idle wanderings"
807,THE LODESTAR,Had brought me to this old man and his wife.
808,THE LODESTAR,"And as I brooded o’er the blaze,"
809,THE LODESTAR,I thought with awe of that steadfast desire
810,THE LODESTAR,"Which, unto me unknown,"
811,THE LODESTAR,"Had drawn me through long years, by such strange ways,"
812,THE LODESTAR,From that dark fo’c’sle to this cottage-fire.
813,THE LODESTAR,
814,THE LODESTAR,"And now, at last, quite spent, I dropped asleep:"
815,THE LODESTAR,And slumbered long and deep:
816,THE LODESTAR,"And when I waked, the peats were smouldering white"
817,THE LODESTAR,Upon the white hearthstone:
818,THE LODESTAR,And over heath and bent dawn kindled bright
819,THE LODESTAR,Beyond dark ridges in a rosy fleece:
820,THE LODESTAR,While from the little window morning light
821,THE LODESTAR,"Fell on her face, made holy with the peace"
822,THE LODESTAR,That passeth understanding; and was shed
823,THE LODESTAR,In tender beams upon the low-bowed head
824,THE LODESTAR,"Of that old man, forlorn beside the bed."
825,THE LODESTAR,
826,THE LODESTAR,
827,THE LODESTAR,
828,THE LODESTAR,
829,THE SHOP,THE SHOP
830,THE SHOP,
831,THE SHOP,"Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkle, went the bell,"
832,THE SHOP,"As I pushed in; and, once again, the smell"
833,THE SHOP,"Of groceries, and news-sheets freshly-printed,"
834,THE SHOP,That always greeted me when I looked in
835,THE SHOP,"To buy my evening-paper: but, to-night,"
836,THE SHOP,"I wondered not to see the well-known face,"
837,THE SHOP,"With kind, brown eyes, and ever-friendly smile,"
838,THE SHOP,Behind the counter; and to find the place
839,THE SHOP,"Deserted at this hour, and not a light"
840,THE SHOP,"In either window.  Waiting there, a while,"
841,THE SHOP,"Though wondering at what change these changes hinted,"
842,THE SHOP,I yet was grateful for the quiet gloom--
843,THE SHOP,"Lit only by a gleam from the back-room,"
844,THE SHOP,"And, here and there, a glint of glass and tin--"
845,THE SHOP,"So pleasant, after all the flare and din"
846,THE SHOP,"And hubbub of the foundry: and my eyes,"
847,THE SHOP,"Still tingling from the smoke, were glad to rest"
848,THE SHOP,"Upon the ordered shelves, so neatly dressed"
849,THE SHOP,"That, even in the dusk, they seemed to tell"
850,THE SHOP,"No little of the hand that kept them clean,"
851,THE SHOP,And of the head that sorted things so well
852,THE SHOP,"That naught of waste or worry could be seen,"
853,THE SHOP,And kept all sweet with ever-fresh supplies.
854,THE SHOP,
855,THE SHOP,"And, as I thought upon her quiet way,"
856,THE SHOP,"Wondering what could have got her, that she’d left"
857,THE SHOP,"The shop, unlit, untended, and bereft"
858,THE SHOP,"Of her kind presence, overhead I heard"
859,THE SHOP,"A tiptoe creak, as though somebody stirred,"
860,THE SHOP,"With careful step, across the upper floor:"
861,THE SHOP,"Then all was silent, till the back-room door"
862,THE SHOP,Swung open; and her husband hurried in.
863,THE SHOP,"He feared he’d kept me, waiting in the dark;"
864,THE SHOP,And he was sorry: but his wife who served
865,THE SHOP,The customers at night-time usually--
866,THE SHOP,"While he made up the ledger after tea,"
867,THE SHOP,"Was busy, when I ... Well, to tell the truth,"
868,THE SHOP,"They were in trouble, for their little son"
869,THE SHOP,Had come in ill from school ... the doctor said
870,THE SHOP,Pneumonia ... they’d been putting him to bed:
871,THE SHOP,"Perhaps, I’d heard them, moving overhead,"
872,THE SHOP,"For boards would creak, and creak, for all your care."
873,THE SHOP,They hoped the best; for he was young; and youth
874,THE SHOP,Could come through much; and all that could be done
875,THE SHOP,"Would be ... then he stood, listening, quite unnerved,"
876,THE SHOP,"As though he heard a footstep on the stair,"
877,THE SHOP,Though I heard nothing: but at my remark
878,THE SHOP,"About the fog and sleet, he turned,"
879,THE SHOP,"And answered quickly, as there burned"
880,THE SHOP,In his brown eyes an eager flame:
881,THE SHOP,The raw and damp were much to blame:
882,THE SHOP,If but his son might breathe West-country air!
883,THE SHOP,A certain Cornish village he could name
884,THE SHOP,"Was just the place; if they could send him there,"
885,THE SHOP,"And only for a week, he’d come back stronger..."
886,THE SHOP,"And then, again, he listened: and I took"
887,THE SHOP,"My paper, and went, afraid to keep him longer;"
888,THE SHOP,And left him standing with that haggard look.
889,THE SHOP,
890,THE SHOP,"Next night, as I pushed in, there was no tinkle:"
891,THE SHOP,"And, glancing up, I saw the bell was gone;"
892,THE SHOP,"Although, in either window, the gas shone;"
893,THE SHOP,And I was greeted by a cheery twinkle
894,THE SHOP,Of burnished tins and bottles from the shelves:
895,THE SHOP,"And now, I saw the father busy there"
896,THE SHOP,"Behind the counter, cutting with a string"
897,THE SHOP,"A bar of soap up for a customer,"
898,THE SHOP,"With weary eyes, and jerky, harassed air,"
899,THE SHOP,As if his mind were hardly on the task:
900,THE SHOP,"And when ’twas done, and parcelled up for her,"
901,THE SHOP,"And she had gone; he turned to me, and said:"
902,THE SHOP,He thought that folks might cut their soap themselves.
903,THE SHOP,"’Twas nothing much ... but any little thing,"
904,THE SHOP,"At such a time ... And, having little doubt"
905,THE SHOP,"The boy was worse, I did not like to ask;"
906,THE SHOP,"So picked my paper up, and hurried out."
907,THE SHOP,
908,THE SHOP,"And, all next day, amid the glare and clang"
909,THE SHOP,"And clatter of the workshop, his words rang;"
910,THE SHOP,"And kept on ringing, in my head a-ring;"
911,THE SHOP,But any little thing ... at such a time...
912,THE SHOP,And kept on chiming to the anvils’ chime:
913,THE SHOP,But any little thing ... at such a time...
914,THE SHOP,And they were hissed and sputtered in the sizzle
915,THE SHOP,Of water on hot iron: little thing...
916,THE SHOP,"At such a time: and, when I left, at last,"
917,THE SHOP,"The smoke and steam; and walked through the cold drizzle,"
918,THE SHOP,The lumbering of the ’buses as they passed
919,THE SHOP,"Seemed full of it; and to the passing feet,"
920,THE SHOP,"The words kept patter, patter, with dull beat."
921,THE SHOP,
922,THE SHOP,"I almost feared to turn into their street,"
923,THE SHOP,Lest I should find the blinds down in the shop:
924,THE SHOP,"And, more than once, I’d half-a-mind to stop,"
925,THE SHOP,"And buy my paper from the yelling boys,"
926,THE SHOP,Who darted all about with such a noise
927,THE SHOP,"That I half-wondered, in a foolish way,"
928,THE SHOP,"How they could shriek so, knowing that the sound"
929,THE SHOP,"Must worry children, lying ill in bed..."
930,THE SHOP,"Then, thinking even they must earn their bread,"
931,THE SHOP,"As I earned mine, and scarce as noisily!"
932,THE SHOP,I wandered on; and very soon I found
933,THE SHOP,I’d followed where my thoughts had been all day.
934,THE SHOP,"And stood before the shop, relieved to see"
935,THE SHOP,"The gases burning, and no window-blind"
936,THE SHOP,"Of blank foreboding.  With an easier mind,"
937,THE SHOP,I entered slowly; and was glad to find
938,THE SHOP,"The father by the counter, ’waiting me,"
939,THE SHOP,With paper ready and a cheery face.
940,THE SHOP,"Yes! yes! the boy was better ... took the turn,"
941,THE SHOP,"Last night, just after I had left the place."
942,THE SHOP,He feared that he’d been short and cross last night.
943,THE SHOP,"But, when a little child was suffering,"
944,THE SHOP,"It worried you ... and any little thing,"
945,THE SHOP,"At such a moment, made you cut up rough:"
946,THE SHOP,"Though, now that he was going on all right..."
947,THE SHOP,"Well, he’d have patience, now, to be polite!"
948,THE SHOP,"And, soon as ever he was well enough,"
949,THE SHOP,The boy should go to Cornwall for a change--
950,THE SHOP,"Should go to his own home; for he, himself,"
951,THE SHOP,"Was Cornish, born and bred, his wife as well:"
952,THE SHOP,And still his parents lived in the old place--
953,THE SHOP,"A little place, as snug as snug could be..."
954,THE SHOP,Where apple-blossom dipped into the sea...
955,THE SHOP,"Perhaps, to strangers’ ears, that sounded strange--"
956,THE SHOP,But not to any Cornishman who knew
957,THE SHOP,How sea and land ran up into each other;
958,THE SHOP,"And how, all round each wide, blue estuary,"
959,THE SHOP,The flowers were blooming to the waters’ edge:
960,THE SHOP,You’d come on blue-bells like a sea of blue...
961,THE SHOP,But they would not be out for some while yet...
962,THE SHOP,"’Twould be primroses, blowing everywhere,"
963,THE SHOP,"Primroses, and primroses, and primroses..."
964,THE SHOP,"You’d never half-know what primroses were,"
965,THE SHOP,Unless you’d seen them growing in the West;
966,THE SHOP,"But, having seen, would never more forget."
967,THE SHOP,"Why, every bank, and every lane and hedge"
968,THE SHOP,"Was just one blaze of yellow; and the smell,"
969,THE SHOP,"When the sun shone upon them, after wet..."
970,THE SHOP,"And his eyes sparkled, as he turned to sell"
971,THE SHOP,A penny loaf and half-an-ounce of tea
972,THE SHOP,"To a poor child, who waited patiently,"
973,THE SHOP,With hacking cough that tore her hollow chest:
974,THE SHOP,"And, as she went out, clutching tight the change,"
975,THE SHOP,"He muttered to himself: It’s strange, it’s strange"
976,THE SHOP,That little ones should suffer so....  The light
977,THE SHOP,"Had left his eyes: but, when he turned to me,"
978,THE SHOP,"I saw a flame leap in them, hot and bright."
979,THE SHOP,"I’d like to take them all, he said, to-night!"
980,THE SHOP,
981,THE SHOP,"And, in the workshop, all through the next day,"
982,THE SHOP,The anvils had another tune to play...
983,THE SHOP,"Primroses, and primroses, and primroses:"
984,THE SHOP,"The bellows puffing out: It’s strange, it’s strange"
985,THE SHOP,That little ones should suffer so...
986,THE SHOP,"And now, my hammer, at a blow:"
987,THE SHOP,"I’d like to take them all, to-night!"
988,THE SHOP,"And, in the clouds of steam, and white-hot glow,"
989,THE SHOP,"I seemed to see primroses everywhere,"
990,THE SHOP,"Primroses, and primroses, and primroses."
991,THE SHOP,
992,THE SHOP,"And, each night after that, I heard the boy"
993,THE SHOP,Was mending quickly; and would soon be well:
994,THE SHOP,Till one night I was startled by the bell:
995,THE SHOP,"Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkle, loud and clear;"
996,THE SHOP,"And tried to hush it, lest the lad should hear."
997,THE SHOP,"But, when the father saw me clutch the thing,"
998,THE SHOP,"He said, the boy had missed it yesterday;"
999,THE SHOP,And wondered why he could not hear it ring;
1000,THE SHOP,And wanted it; and had to have his way.
1001,THE SHOP,"And then, with brown eyes burning with deep joy,"
1002,THE SHOP,"He told me, that his son was going West--"
1003,THE SHOP,"Was going home ... the doctor thought, next week,"
1004,THE SHOP,He’d be quite well enough: the way was long;
1005,THE SHOP,But trains were quick; and he would soon be there
1006,THE SHOP,"And on the journey he’d have every care,"
1007,THE SHOP,"His mother being with him ... it was best,"
1008,THE SHOP,"That she should go: for he would find it strange,"
1009,THE SHOP,"The little chap, at first ... she needed change..."
1010,THE SHOP,"And, when they’d had a whiff of Western air!"
1011,THE SHOP,’Twould cost a deal; and there was naught to spare
1012,THE SHOP,"But, what was money, if you hadn’t health:"
1013,THE SHOP,"And, what more could you buy, if you’d the wealth..."
1014,THE SHOP,"Yes! ’twould be lonely for himself, and rough;"
1015,THE SHOP,"Though, on the whole, he’d manage well enough:"
1016,THE SHOP,He’d have a lot to do: and there was naught
1017,THE SHOP,Like work to keep folk cheerful: when the hand
1018,THE SHOP,"Was busy, you had little time for thought;"
1019,THE SHOP,And thinking was the mischief ... and ’twas grand
1020,THE SHOP,To know that they’d be happy.  Then the bell
1021,THE SHOP,Went tinkle-tinkle; and he turned to sell.
1022,THE SHOP,
1023,THE SHOP,"One night he greeted me with face that shone,"
1024,THE SHOP,Although the eyes were wistful; they were gone--
1025,THE SHOP,"Had gone this morning, he was glad to say:"
1026,THE SHOP,"And, though ’twas sore work, setting them away,"
1027,THE SHOP,"Still, ’twas the best for them ... and they would be"
1028,THE SHOP,Already in the cottage by the sea...
1029,THE SHOP,He spoke no more of them; but turned his head;
1030,THE SHOP,And said he wondered if the price of bread...
1031,THE SHOP,"And, as I went again into the night,"
1032,THE SHOP,I saw his eyes were glistening in the light.
1033,THE SHOP,
1034,THE SHOP,"And, two nights after that, he’d got a letter:"
1035,THE SHOP,And all was well: the boy was keeping better;
1036,THE SHOP,"And was as happy as a child could be,"
1037,THE SHOP,"All day with the primroses and the sea,"
1038,THE SHOP,"And pigs!  Of all the wonders of the West,"
1039,THE SHOP,"His mother wrote, he liked the pigs the best."
1040,THE SHOP,And now the father laughed until the tears
1041,THE SHOP,"Were in his eyes, and chuckled: Aye! he knew!"
1042,THE SHOP,"Had he not been a boy there once, himself?"
1043,THE SHOP,"He’d liked pigs, too, when he was his son’s years."
1044,THE SHOP,"And then, he reached a half-loaf from the shelf;"
1045,THE SHOP,"And twisted up a farthing’s worth of tea,"
1046,THE SHOP,"And farthing’s worth of sugar, for the child,"
1047,THE SHOP,"The same poor child who waited patiently,"
1048,THE SHOP,"Still shaken by a hacking, racking cough."
1049,THE SHOP,
1050,THE SHOP,"And, all next day, the anvils rang with jigs:"
1051,THE SHOP,"The bellows roared and rumbled with loud laughter,"
1052,THE SHOP,"Until it seemed the workshop had gone wild,"
1053,THE SHOP,"And it would echo, echo, ever after"
1054,THE SHOP,"The tune the hammers tinkled on and off,"
1055,THE SHOP,A silly tune of primroses and pigs...
1056,THE SHOP,Of all the wonders of the West
1057,THE SHOP,"He liked the pigs, he liked the pigs the best!"
1058,THE SHOP,
1059,THE SHOP,"Next night, as I went in, I caught"
1060,THE SHOP,"A strange, fresh smell.  The postman had just brought"
1061,THE SHOP,"A precious box from Cornwall, and the shop"
1062,THE SHOP,"Was lit with primroses, that lay atop"
1063,THE SHOP,"A Cornish pasty, and a pot of cream:"
1064,THE SHOP,"And, as, with gentle hands, the father lifted"
1065,THE SHOP,"The flowers his little son had plucked for him,"
1066,THE SHOP,"He stood a moment in a far-off dream,"
1067,THE SHOP,As though in glad remembrances he drifted
1068,THE SHOP,"On Western seas: and, as his eyes grew dim,"
1069,THE SHOP,"He stooped, and buried them in deep, sweet bloom"
1070,THE SHOP,"Till, hearing, once again, the poor child’s cough,"
1071,THE SHOP,"He served her hurriedly, and sent her off,"
1072,THE SHOP,"Quite happily, with thin hands filled with flowers."
1073,THE SHOP,"And, as I followed to the street, the gloom"
1074,THE SHOP,Was starred with primroses; and many hours
1075,THE SHOP,"The strange, shy flickering surprise"
1076,THE SHOP,"Of that child’s keen, enchanted eyes"
1077,THE SHOP,"Lit up my heart, and brightened my dull room."
1078,THE SHOP,
1079,THE SHOP,"Then, many nights the foundry kept me late"
1080,THE SHOP,With overtime; and I was much too tired
1081,THE SHOP,To go round by the shop; but made for bed
1082,THE SHOP,As straight as I could go: until one night
1083,THE SHOP,"We’d left off earlier, though ’twas after eight,"
1084,THE SHOP,I thought I’d like some news about the boy.
1085,THE SHOP,I found the shop untended; and the bell
1086,THE SHOP,Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkled all in vain.
1087,THE SHOP,"And then I saw, through the half-curtained pane,"
1088,THE SHOP,The back-room was a very blaze of joy:
1089,THE SHOP,And knew the mother and son had come safe back.
1090,THE SHOP,"And, as I slipped away, now all was well,"
1091,THE SHOP,"I heard the boy shriek out, in shrill delight:"
1092,THE SHOP,"""And, father, all the little pigs were black!"""
1093,THE SHOP,

1096,THE SHOP,
1097,FLANNAN ISLE,FLANNAN ISLE
1098,FLANNAN ISLE,
1099,FLANNAN ISLE,"""Though three men dwell on Flannan Isle"
1100,FLANNAN ISLE,"To keep the lamp alight,"
1101,FLANNAN ISLE,"As we steered under the lee, we caught"
1102,FLANNAN ISLE,"No glimmer through the night."""
1103,FLANNAN ISLE,
1104,FLANNAN ISLE,A passing ship at dawn had brought
1105,FLANNAN ISLE,"The news; and quickly we set sail,"
1106,FLANNAN ISLE,To find out what strange thing might ail
1107,FLANNAN ISLE,The keepers of the deep-sea light.
1108,FLANNAN ISLE,
1109,FLANNAN ISLE,"The Winter day broke blue and bright,"
1110,FLANNAN ISLE,"With glancing sun and glancing spray,"
1111,FLANNAN ISLE,"As o’er the swell our boat made way,"
1112,FLANNAN ISLE,As gallant as a gull in flight.
1113,FLANNAN ISLE,
1114,FLANNAN ISLE,"But, as we neared the lonely Isle;"
1115,FLANNAN ISLE,And looked up at the naked height;
1116,FLANNAN ISLE,"And saw the lighthouse towering white,"
1117,FLANNAN ISLE,"With blinded lantern, that all night"
1118,FLANNAN ISLE,Had never shot a spark
1119,FLANNAN ISLE,"Of comfort through the dark,"
1120,FLANNAN ISLE,So ghostly in the cold sunlight
1121,FLANNAN ISLE,"It seemed, that we were struck the while"
1122,FLANNAN ISLE,With wonder all too dread for words.
1123,FLANNAN ISLE,
1124,FLANNAN ISLE,"And, as into the tiny creek"
1125,FLANNAN ISLE,"We stole beneath the hanging crag,"
1126,FLANNAN ISLE,"We saw three queer, black, ugly birds--"
1127,FLANNAN ISLE,"Too big, by far, in my belief,"
1128,FLANNAN ISLE,For guillemot or shag--
1129,FLANNAN ISLE,Like seamen sitting bolt-upright
1130,FLANNAN ISLE,Upon a half-tide reef:
1131,FLANNAN ISLE,"But, as we neared, they plunged from sight,"
1132,FLANNAN ISLE,"Without a sound, or spurt of white."
1133,FLANNAN ISLE,
1134,FLANNAN ISLE,"And still too mazed to speak,"
1135,FLANNAN ISLE,We landed; and made fast the boat;
1136,FLANNAN ISLE,"And climbed the track in single file,"
1137,FLANNAN ISLE,"Each wishing he was safe afloat,"
1138,FLANNAN ISLE,"On any sea, however far,"
1139,FLANNAN ISLE,So it be far from Flannan Isle:
1140,FLANNAN ISLE,"And still we seemed to climb, and climb,"
1141,FLANNAN ISLE,"As though we’d lost all count of time,"
1142,FLANNAN ISLE,And so must climb for evermore.
1143,FLANNAN ISLE,"Yet, all too soon, we reached the door--"
1144,FLANNAN ISLE,"The black, sun-blistered lighthouse-door,"
1145,FLANNAN ISLE,That gaped for us ajar.
1146,FLANNAN ISLE,
1147,FLANNAN ISLE,"As, on the threshold, for a spell,"
1148,FLANNAN ISLE,"We paused, we seemed to breathe the smell"
1149,FLANNAN ISLE,"Of limewash and of tar,"
1150,FLANNAN ISLE,"Familiar as our daily breath,"
1151,FLANNAN ISLE,As though ’twere some strange scent of death
1152,FLANNAN ISLE,"And so, yet wondering, side by side,"
1153,FLANNAN ISLE,"We stood a moment, still tongue-tied:"
1154,FLANNAN ISLE,And each with black foreboding eyed
1155,FLANNAN ISLE,"The door, ere we should fling it wide,"
1156,FLANNAN ISLE,To leave the sunlight for the gloom:
1157,FLANNAN ISLE,"Till, plucking courage up, at last,"
1158,FLANNAN ISLE,"Hard on each other’s heels we passed,"
1159,FLANNAN ISLE,Into the living-room.
1160,FLANNAN ISLE,
1161,FLANNAN ISLE,"Yet, as we crowded through the door,"
1162,FLANNAN ISLE,"We only saw a table, spread"
1163,FLANNAN ISLE,"For dinner, meat and cheese and bread;"
1164,FLANNAN ISLE,"But, all untouched; and no one there:"
1165,FLANNAN ISLE,"As though, when they sat down to eat,"
1166,FLANNAN ISLE,"Ere they could even taste,"
1167,FLANNAN ISLE,Alarm had come; and they in haste
1168,FLANNAN ISLE,Had risen and left the bread and meat:
1169,FLANNAN ISLE,For at the table-head a chair
1170,FLANNAN ISLE,Lay tumbled on the floor.
1171,FLANNAN ISLE,
1172,FLANNAN ISLE,We listened; but we only heard
1173,FLANNAN ISLE,The feeble cheeping of a bird
1174,FLANNAN ISLE,That starved upon its perch:
1175,FLANNAN ISLE,"And, listening still, without a word,"
1176,FLANNAN ISLE,We set about our hopeless search.
1177,FLANNAN ISLE,
1178,FLANNAN ISLE,"We hunted high, we hunted low;"
1179,FLANNAN ISLE,And soon ransacked the empty house;
1180,FLANNAN ISLE,"Then o’er the Island, to and fro,"
1181,FLANNAN ISLE,"We ranged, to listen and to look"
1182,FLANNAN ISLE,"In every cranny, cleft or nook"
1183,FLANNAN ISLE,That might have hid a bird or mouse:
1184,FLANNAN ISLE,"But, though we searched from shore to shore,"
1185,FLANNAN ISLE,We found no sign in any place:
1186,FLANNAN ISLE,And soon again stood face to face
1187,FLANNAN ISLE,Before the gaping door:
1188,FLANNAN ISLE,And stole into the room once more
1189,FLANNAN ISLE,As frightened children steal.
1190,FLANNAN ISLE,
1191,FLANNAN ISLE,"Aye: though we hunted high and low,"
1192,FLANNAN ISLE,"And hunted everywhere,"
1193,FLANNAN ISLE,Of the three men’s fate we found no trace
1194,FLANNAN ISLE,"Of any kind in any place,"
1195,FLANNAN ISLE,"But a door ajar, and an untouched meal,"
1196,FLANNAN ISLE,And an overtoppled chair.
1197,FLANNAN ISLE,
1198,FLANNAN ISLE,"And, as we listened in the gloom"
1199,FLANNAN ISLE,Of that forsaken living-room---
1200,FLANNAN ISLE,A chill clutch on our breath--
1201,FLANNAN ISLE,We thought how ill-chance came to all
1202,FLANNAN ISLE,Who kept the Flannan Light:
1203,FLANNAN ISLE,And how the rock had been the death
1204,FLANNAN ISLE,Of many a likely lad:
1205,FLANNAN ISLE,"How six had come to a sudden end,"
1206,FLANNAN ISLE,And three had gone stark mad:
1207,FLANNAN ISLE,And one whom we’d all known as friend
1208,FLANNAN ISLE,"Had leapt from the lantern one still night,"
1209,FLANNAN ISLE,And fallen dead by the lighthouse wall:
1210,FLANNAN ISLE,And long we thought
1211,FLANNAN ISLE,"On the three we sought,"
1212,FLANNAN ISLE,And of what might yet befall.
1213,FLANNAN ISLE,
1214,FLANNAN ISLE,"Like curs, a glance has brought to heel,"
1215,FLANNAN ISLE,"We listened, flinching there:"
1216,FLANNAN ISLE,"And looked, and looked, on the untouched meal,"
1217,FLANNAN ISLE,And the overtoppled chair.
1218,FLANNAN ISLE,
1219,FLANNAN ISLE,"We seemed to stand for an endless while,"
1220,FLANNAN ISLE,"Though still no word was said,"
1221,FLANNAN ISLE,"Three men alive on Flannan Isle,"
1222,FLANNAN ISLE,"Who thought, on three men dead."
1223,FLANNAN ISLE,

1227,THE BROTHERS,THE BROTHERS
1228,THE BROTHERS,
1229,THE BROTHERS,"All morning they had quarrelled, as they worked,"
1230,THE BROTHERS,"A little off their fellows, in the pit:"
1231,THE BROTHERS,Dick growled at Robert; Robert said Dick shirked:
1232,THE BROTHERS,"And when the roof, dropt more than they had reckoned,"
1233,THE BROTHERS,"Began to crack and split,"
1234,THE BROTHERS,Though both rushed like a shot to set
1235,THE BROTHERS,"The pit-props in their places,"
1236,THE BROTHERS,"Each said the other was to blame,"
1237,THE BROTHERS,"When, all secure, with flushed and grimy faces,"
1238,THE BROTHERS,They faced each other for a second.
1239,THE BROTHERS,"All morning they had quarrelled: yet,"
1240,THE BROTHERS,Neither had breathed her name.
1241,THE BROTHERS,
1242,THE BROTHERS,Again they turned to work:
1243,THE BROTHERS,And in the dusty murk
1244,THE BROTHERS,Of that black gallery
1245,THE BROTHERS,"Which ran out three miles underneath the sea,"
1246,THE BROTHERS,"There was no sound at all,"
1247,THE BROTHERS,Save whispering creak of roof and wall.
1248,THE BROTHERS,"And crack of coal, and tap of pick,"
1249,THE BROTHERS,And now and then a rattling fall:
1250,THE BROTHERS,"While Robert worked on steadily, but Dick"
1251,THE BROTHERS,"In fits and starts, with teeth clenched tight,"
1252,THE BROTHERS,And dark eyes flashing in his lamp’s dull light.
1253,THE BROTHERS,
1254,THE BROTHERS,"And when he paused, nigh spent, to wipe the sweat"
1255,THE BROTHERS,From off his dripping brow: and Robert turned
1256,THE BROTHERS,"To fling some idle jibe at him, the spark"
1257,THE BROTHERS,"Of anger, smouldering in him, flared and burned--"
1258,THE BROTHERS,"Though all his body quivered, wringing-wet--"
1259,THE BROTHERS,Till that black hole
1260,THE BROTHERS,"To him blazed red,"
1261,THE BROTHERS,As if the very coal
1262,THE BROTHERS,Had kindled underfoot and overhead:
1263,THE BROTHERS,"Then, gripping tight his pick,"
1264,THE BROTHERS,He rushed upon his brother:
1265,THE BROTHERS,"But Robert, turning quick,"
1266,THE BROTHERS,"Leapt up, and now they faced each other."
1267,THE BROTHERS,
1268,THE BROTHERS,"They faced each other: Dick with arm upraised,"
1269,THE BROTHERS,"In act to strike, and murder in his eyes...."
1270,THE BROTHERS,"When, suddenly, with noise of thunder,"
1271,THE BROTHERS,"The earth shook round them, rumbling o’er and under;"
1272,THE BROTHERS,"And Dick saw Robert, lying at his feet:"
1273,THE BROTHERS,"As, close behind, the gallery crashed in:"
1274,THE BROTHERS,"And almost at his heel, earth gaped asunder."
1275,THE BROTHERS,"By black disaster dazed,"
1276,THE BROTHERS,His wrath died; and he dropped the pick;
1277,THE BROTHERS,"And staggered, dizzily and terror-sick."
1278,THE BROTHERS,"But, when the dust and din"
1279,THE BROTHERS,"Had settled to a stillness, dread as death:"
1280,THE BROTHERS,And he once more could draw his breath;
1281,THE BROTHERS,He gave a little joyful shout
1282,THE BROTHERS,To find the lamps had not gone out.
1283,THE BROTHERS,
1284,THE BROTHERS,And on his knees he fell
1285,THE BROTHERS,"Beside his brother, buried in black dust:"
1286,THE BROTHERS,"And, full of tense misgiving,"
1287,THE BROTHERS,"He lifted him, and thrust"
1288,THE BROTHERS,A knee beneath his head; and cleared
1289,THE BROTHERS,The dust from mouth and nose: but could not tell
1290,THE BROTHERS,Awhile if he were dead or living.
1291,THE BROTHERS,"Too fearful to know what he feared,"
1292,THE BROTHERS,"He fumbled at the open shirt,"
1293,THE BROTHERS,"And felt till he could feel the heart,"
1294,THE BROTHERS,Still beating with a feeble beat:
1295,THE BROTHERS,"And then he saw the closed lids part,"
1296,THE BROTHERS,And saw the nostrils quiver;
1297,THE BROTHERS,"And knew his brother lived, though sorely hurt."
1298,THE BROTHERS,
1299,THE BROTHERS,"Again he staggered to his feet,"
1300,THE BROTHERS,"And fetched his water-can, and wet"
1301,THE BROTHERS,"The ashy lips, and bathed the brow,"
1302,THE BROTHERS,"Until his brother sat up with a shiver,"
1303,THE BROTHERS,And gazed before him with a senseless stare
1304,THE BROTHERS,And dull eyes strangely set.
1305,THE BROTHERS,Too well Dick knew that now
1306,THE BROTHERS,"They must not linger there,"
1307,THE BROTHERS,"Cut off from all their mates, to be o’ertaken"
1308,THE BROTHERS,"In less than no time by the deadly damp,"
1309,THE BROTHERS,"So, picking up his lamp,"
1310,THE BROTHERS,He made his brother rise;
1311,THE BROTHERS,"Then took him by the arm,"
1312,THE BROTHERS,"And shook him, till he’d shaken"
1313,THE BROTHERS,An inkling of the danger and alarm
1314,THE BROTHERS,"Into those dull, still eyes:"
1315,THE BROTHERS,"Then dragged him, and half-carried him, in haste,"
1316,THE BROTHERS,"To reach the airway, where ’twould still be sweet"
1317,THE BROTHERS,When all the gallery was foul with gas:
1318,THE BROTHERS,"But, soon as they had reached it, they were faced"
1319,THE BROTHERS,By a big fall of roof they could not pass;
1320,THE BROTHERS,"And found themselves cut off from all retreat,"
1321,THE BROTHERS,"On every hand, by that black shining wall;"
1322,THE BROTHERS,With naught to do but sit and wait
1323,THE BROTHERS,"Till rescue came, if rescue came at all,"
1324,THE BROTHERS,And did not come too late.
1325,THE BROTHERS,
1326,THE BROTHERS,"And, in the fresher airway, light came back"
1327,THE BROTHERS,"To Robert’s eyes, although he never spoke:"
1328,THE BROTHERS,"And not a sound the deathly quiet broke,"
1329,THE BROTHERS,As they sat staring at that wall of black--
1330,THE BROTHERS,"As, in the glimmer of the dusky lamp,"
1331,THE BROTHERS,"They sat and wondered, wondered if the damp--"
1332,THE BROTHERS,"The stealthy after-damp that creeping, creeping,"
1333,THE BROTHERS,"Takes strong lads by the throat, and drops them sleeping,"
1334,THE BROTHERS,To wake no more for any woman’s weeping--
1335,THE BROTHERS,"Would steal upon them, ere the rescue came...."
1336,THE BROTHERS,"And if the rescuers would find them sitting,"
1337,THE BROTHERS,Would find them sitting cold....
1338,THE BROTHERS,"Then, as they sat and wondered, like a flame"
1339,THE BROTHERS,One thought burned up both hearts:
1340,THE BROTHERS,"Still, neither breathed her name."
1341,THE BROTHERS,
1342,THE BROTHERS,"And now their thoughts dropped back into the pit,"
1343,THE BROTHERS,And through the league-long gallery went flitting
1344,THE BROTHERS,With speed no fall could hold:
1345,THE BROTHERS,They wondered how their mates had fared:
1346,THE BROTHERS,"If they’d been struck stone-dead,"
1347,THE BROTHERS,Or if they shared
1348,THE BROTHERS,"Like fate with them, or reached the shaft,"
1349,THE BROTHERS,"Unhurt, and only scared,"
1350,THE BROTHERS,Before disaster overtook them:
1351,THE BROTHERS,"And then, although their courage ne’er forsook them,"
1352,THE BROTHERS,They wondered once again if they must sit
1353,THE BROTHERS,Awaiting death ... but knowing well
1354,THE BROTHERS,That even for a while to dwell
1355,THE BROTHERS,On such like thoughts will drive a strong man daft:
1356,THE BROTHERS,They shook themselves until their thoughts ran free
1357,THE BROTHERS,"Along the drift, and clambered in the cage;"
1358,THE BROTHERS,And in a trice were shooting up the shaft:
1359,THE BROTHERS,"But when their thoughts had come to the pithead,"
1360,THE BROTHERS,"And found the fearful people gathered there,"
1361,THE BROTHERS,"Beneath the noonday sun,"
1362,THE BROTHERS,"Bright-eyed with terror, blinded by despair,"
1363,THE BROTHERS,"Dick rose, and with his chalk wrote on the wall,"
1364,THE BROTHERS,This message for their folk:
1365,THE BROTHERS,"""We can’t get any further, 12, noonday""--"
1366,THE BROTHERS,"And signed both names; and, when he’d done,"
1367,THE BROTHERS,"Though neither of them spoke,"
1368,THE BROTHERS,"They both seemed easier in a way,"
1369,THE BROTHERS,"Now that they’d left a word,"
1370,THE BROTHERS,Though nothing but a scrawl.
1371,THE BROTHERS,
1372,THE BROTHERS,"And silent still they sat,"
1373,THE BROTHERS,And never stirred:
1374,THE BROTHERS,And Dick’s thoughts dwelt on this and that:
1375,THE BROTHERS,"How, far above their heads, upon the sea"
1376,THE BROTHERS,"The sun was shining merrily,"
1377,THE BROTHERS,And in its golden glancing
1378,THE BROTHERS,The windy waves were dancing:
1379,THE BROTHERS,And how he’d slipt that morning on his way:
1380,THE BROTHERS,"And how on Friday, when he drew his pay,"
1381,THE BROTHERS,"He’d buy a blanket for his whippet, Nell;"
1382,THE BROTHERS,"He felt dead certain she would win the race,"
1383,THE BROTHERS,"On Saturday ... though you could never tell,"
1384,THE BROTHERS,There were such odds against her ... but his face
1385,THE BROTHERS,"Lit up as though, even now, he saw her run,"
1386,THE BROTHERS,"A little slip of lightning, in the sun:"
1387,THE BROTHERS,While Robert’s thoughts were ever on the match
1388,THE BROTHERS,His team was booked to play on Saturday;
1389,THE BROTHERS,"He placed the field, and settled who should play"
1390,THE BROTHERS,The centre-forward; for he had a doubt
1391,THE BROTHERS,"Will Burn was scarcely up to form, although..."
1392,THE BROTHERS,
1393,THE BROTHERS,"Just then, the lamp went slowly out."
1394,THE BROTHERS,
1395,THE BROTHERS,"Still, neither stirred,"
1396,THE BROTHERS,Nor spoke a word;
1397,THE BROTHERS,"Though either’s breath came quickly, with a catch."
1398,THE BROTHERS,
1399,THE BROTHERS,And now again one thought
1400,THE BROTHERS,Set both their hearts afire
1401,THE BROTHERS,In one fierce flame
1402,THE BROTHERS,Of quick desire:
1403,THE BROTHERS,Though neither breathed her name.
1404,THE BROTHERS,
1405,THE BROTHERS,Then Dick stretched out his hand; and caught
1406,THE BROTHERS,His brother’s arm; and whispered in his ear:
1407,THE BROTHERS,"""Bob, lad, there’s naught to fear ..."
1408,THE BROTHERS,"And, when we’re out, lad, you and she shall wed."""
1409,THE BROTHERS,
1410,THE BROTHERS,"Bob gripped Dick’s hand; and then no more was said,"
1411,THE BROTHERS,"As, slowly, all about them rose"
1412,THE BROTHERS,The deadly after-damp; but close
1413,THE BROTHERS,"They sat together, hand in hand."
1414,THE BROTHERS,Then their minds wandered; and Dick seemed to stand
1415,THE BROTHERS,And shout till he was hoarse
1416,THE BROTHERS,To speed his winning whippet down the course ...
1417,THE BROTHERS,"And Robert, with the ball"
1418,THE BROTHERS,Secure within his oxter charged ahead
1419,THE BROTHERS,"Straight for the goal, and none could hold,"
1420,THE BROTHERS,Though many tried a fall.
1421,THE BROTHERS,
1422,THE BROTHERS,"Then dreaming they were lucky boys in bed,"
1423,THE BROTHERS,"Once more, and lying snugly by each other:"
1424,THE BROTHERS,"Dick, with his arms clasped tight about his brother,"
1425,THE BROTHERS,Whispered with failing breath
1426,THE BROTHERS,Into the ear of death:
1427,THE BROTHERS,"""Come, Robert, cuddle closer, lad, it’s cold."""
1428,THE BROTHERS,
1429,THE BROTHERS,
1430,THE BROTHERS,
1431,THE BROTHERS,
1432,THE BLIND ROWER,THE BLIND ROWER
1433,THE BLIND ROWER,
1434,THE BLIND ROWER,"And since he rowed his father home,"
1435,THE BLIND ROWER,His hand has never touched an oar.
1436,THE BLIND ROWER,"All day, he wanders on the shore,"
1437,THE BLIND ROWER,And hearkens to the swishing foam.
1438,THE BLIND ROWER,"Though blind from birth, he still could row"
1439,THE BLIND ROWER,As well as any lad with sight;
1440,THE BLIND ROWER,And knew strange things that none may know
1441,THE BLIND ROWER,Save those who live without the light.
1442,THE BLIND ROWER,
1443,THE BLIND ROWER,When they put out that Summer eve
1444,THE BLIND ROWER,"To sink the lobster-pots at sea,"
1445,THE BLIND ROWER,The sun was crimson in the sky;
1446,THE BLIND ROWER,"And not a breath was in the sky,"
1447,THE BLIND ROWER,"The brooding, thunder-laden sky,"
1448,THE BLIND ROWER,"That, heavily and wearily,"
1449,THE BLIND ROWER,Weighed down upon the waveless sea
1450,THE BLIND ROWER,That scarcely seemed to heave.
1451,THE BLIND ROWER,
1452,THE BLIND ROWER,The pots were safely sunk; and then
1453,THE BLIND ROWER,The father gave the word for home:
1454,THE BLIND ROWER,"He took the tiller in his hand,"
1455,THE BLIND ROWER,"And, in his heart already home,"
1456,THE BLIND ROWER,"He brought her nose round towards the land,"
1457,THE BLIND ROWER,To steer her straight for home.
1458,THE BLIND ROWER,
1459,THE BLIND ROWER,"He never spoke,"
1460,THE BLIND ROWER,Nor stirred again:
1461,THE BLIND ROWER,"A sudden stroke,"
1462,THE BLIND ROWER,"And he lay dead,"
1463,THE BLIND ROWER,"With staring eyes, and lips of lead."
1464,THE BLIND ROWER,
1465,THE BLIND ROWER,"The son rowed on, and nothing feared:"
1466,THE BLIND ROWER,"And sometimes, merrily,"
1467,THE BLIND ROWER,"He lifted up his voice, and sang,"
1468,THE BLIND ROWER,"Both high and low,"
1469,THE BLIND ROWER,And loud and sweet:
1470,THE BLIND ROWER,"For he was ever gay at sea,"
1471,THE BLIND ROWER,"And ever glad to row,"
1472,THE BLIND ROWER,And rowed as only blind men row:
1473,THE BLIND ROWER,And little did the blind lad know
1474,THE BLIND ROWER,That death was at his feet:
1475,THE BLIND ROWER,For still he thought his father steered;
1476,THE BLIND ROWER,Nor knew that he was all alone
1477,THE BLIND ROWER,With death upon the open sea.
1478,THE BLIND ROWER,"So merrily, he rowed, and sang;"
1479,THE BLIND ROWER,"And, strangely on the silence rang"
1480,THE BLIND ROWER,"That lonely melody,"
1481,THE BLIND ROWER,"As, through the livid, brooding gloom,"
1482,THE BLIND ROWER,"By rock and reef, he rowed for home--"
1483,THE BLIND ROWER,The blind man rowed the dead man home.
1484,THE BLIND ROWER,
1485,THE BLIND ROWER,"But, as they neared the shore,"
1486,THE BLIND ROWER,He rested on his oar:
1487,THE BLIND ROWER,"And, wondering that his father kept"
1488,THE BLIND ROWER,So very quiet in the stern;
1489,THE BLIND ROWER,"He laughed, and asked him if he slept;"
1490,THE BLIND ROWER,And vowed he heard him snore just now.
1491,THE BLIND ROWER,"Though, when his father spoke no word,"
1492,THE BLIND ROWER,A sudden fear upon him came:
1493,THE BLIND ROWER,"And, crying on his father’s name,"
1494,THE BLIND ROWER,"With flinching heart, he heard"
1495,THE BLIND ROWER,The water lapping on the shore;
1496,THE BLIND ROWER,"And all his blood ran cold, to feel"
1497,THE BLIND ROWER,The shingle grate beneath the keel:
1498,THE BLIND ROWER,"And stretching over towards the stern,"
1499,THE BLIND ROWER,His knuckle touched the dead man’s brow.
1500,THE BLIND ROWER,
1501,THE BLIND ROWER,"But, help was near at hand;"
1502,THE BLIND ROWER,And safe he came to land:
1503,THE BLIND ROWER,Though none has ever known
1504,THE BLIND ROWER,"How he rowed in, alone,"
1505,THE BLIND ROWER,And never touched a reef.
1506,THE BLIND ROWER,Some say they saw the dead man steer--
1507,THE BLIND ROWER,The dead man steer the blind man home--
1508,THE BLIND ROWER,"Though, when they found him dead,"
1509,THE BLIND ROWER,His hand was cold as lead.
1510,THE BLIND ROWER,
1511,THE BLIND ROWER,"So, ever restless, to and fro,"
1512,THE BLIND ROWER,"In every sort of weather,"
1513,THE BLIND ROWER,"The blind lad wanders on the shore,"
1514,THE BLIND ROWER,And hearkens to the foam.
1515,THE BLIND ROWER,"His hand has never touched an oar,"
1516,THE BLIND ROWER,Since they came home together--
1517,THE BLIND ROWER,"The blind, who rowed his father home--"
1518,THE BLIND ROWER,"The dead, who steered his blind son home."
1519,THE BLIND ROWER,
1520,THE BLIND ROWER,
1521,THE BLIND ROWER,
1522,THE BLIND ROWER,
1523,THE FLUTE,THE FLUTE
1524,THE FLUTE,
1525,THE FLUTE,"""Good-night!"" he sang out cheerily:"
1526,THE FLUTE,"""Good-night!"" and yet again: ""Good-night!"""
1527,THE FLUTE,
1528,THE FLUTE,And I was gay that night to be
1529,THE FLUTE,"Once more in my clean countryside,"
1530,THE FLUTE,Among the windy hills and wide.
1531,THE FLUTE,"Six days of city slush and mud,"
1532,THE FLUTE,"Of hooting horn, and spattering wheel,"
1533,THE FLUTE,Made me rejoice again to feel
1534,THE FLUTE,"The tingling frost that fires the blood,"
1535,THE FLUTE,And sets life burning keen and bright;
1536,THE FLUTE,And down the ringing road to stride
1537,THE FLUTE,The eager swinging stride that braces
1538,THE FLUTE,The straining thews from hip to heel:
1539,THE FLUTE,To breathe again the wind that sweeps
1540,THE FLUTE,"Across the grassy, Northern steeps,"
1541,THE FLUTE,From crystal deeps and starry spaces.
1542,THE FLUTE,
1543,THE FLUTE,And I was glad again to hear
1544,THE FLUTE,The old man’s greeting of good cheer:
1545,THE FLUTE,For every night for many a year
1546,THE FLUTE,"At that same corner we had met,"
1547,THE FLUTE,"Summer and Winter, dry and wet:"
1548,THE FLUTE,And though I never once had heard
1549,THE FLUTE,"The old man speak another word,"
1550,THE FLUTE,His cheery greeting at the bend
1551,THE FLUTE,Seemed like the welcome of a friend.
1552,THE FLUTE,
1553,THE FLUTE,"But, as we neared to-night, somehow,"
1554,THE FLUTE,I felt that he would stop and speak:
1555,THE FLUTE,"Though he went by: and when I turned,"
1556,THE FLUTE,"I saw him standing in the road,"
1557,THE FLUTE,"And looking back, with hand to brow,"
1558,THE FLUTE,"As if to shade old eyes, grown weak"
1559,THE FLUTE,Awaiting the long sleep they’d earned:
1560,THE FLUTE,"Though, as again towards him I strode,"
1561,THE FLUTE,A friendly light within them burned.
1562,THE FLUTE,"And then, as I drew nigh, he spoke"
1563,THE FLUTE,"With shaking head, and voice that broke:"
1564,THE FLUTE,"""I’ve missed you these last nights,"" he said"
1565,THE FLUTE,"""And I have not so many now"
1566,THE FLUTE,That I can miss friends easily...
1567,THE FLUTE,"Aye: friends grow scarce, as you grow old:"
1568,THE FLUTE,And roads are rough: and winds are cold:
1569,THE FLUTE,"And when you feel you’re losing hold,"
1570,THE FLUTE,"Life does not go too merrily."""
1571,THE FLUTE,"And then he stood with nodding head,"
1572,THE FLUTE,And spoke no more.  And so I told
1573,THE FLUTE,"How I had been, six days and nights,"
1574,THE FLUTE,Exiled from pleasant sounds and sights.
1575,THE FLUTE,"And now, as though my voice had stirred"
1576,THE FLUTE,"His heart to speech, he told right out,"
1577,THE FLUTE,"With quickening eye and quavering word,"
1578,THE FLUTE,"The things I care to hear about,"
1579,THE FLUTE,The little things that make up life:
1580,THE FLUTE,"How he’d been lonesome, since his wife"
1581,THE FLUTE,"Had died, some thirty year ago:"
1582,THE FLUTE,And how he trudged three mile or so
1583,THE FLUTE,"To reach the farmstead where he worked,"
1584,THE FLUTE,And three mile back to his own door...
1585,THE FLUTE,For he dwelt outby on the moor:
1586,THE FLUTE,And every day the distance irked
1587,THE FLUTE,"More sorely still his poor, old bones;"
1588,THE FLUTE,And all the road seemed strewn with stones
1589,THE FLUTE,"To trip you up, when you were old--"
1590,THE FLUTE,"When you were old, and friends were few:"
1591,THE FLUTE,"How, since the farmstead had been sold,"
1592,THE FLUTE,"The master and the men were new,"
1593,THE FLUTE,All save himself; and they were young;
1594,THE FLUTE,And Mistress had a raspy tongue:
1595,THE FLUTE,"So, often, he would hardly speak"
1596,THE FLUTE,A friendly word from week to week
1597,THE FLUTE,"With any soul.  Old friends had died,"
1598,THE FLUTE,Or else had quit the countryside:
1599,THE FLUTE,"And, since his wife was taken, he"
1600,THE FLUTE,"Had lived alone, this thirty year:"
1601,THE FLUTE,And there were few who cared to hear
1602,THE FLUTE,An old man’s jabber ... and too long
1603,THE FLUTE,"He’d kept me, standing in the cold,"
1604,THE FLUTE,"With his long tongue, and such a song"
1605,THE FLUTE,About himself!  And I would be...
1606,THE FLUTE,
1607,THE FLUTE,I put my arm through his; and turned
1608,THE FLUTE,To go upon his way with him:
1609,THE FLUTE,And once again that warm light burned
1610,THE FLUTE,"In those old eyes, so weak and dim:"
1611,THE FLUTE,"While, with thin, piping voice, he told"
1612,THE FLUTE,How much it meant to him each night
1613,THE FLUTE,To change a kindly word with me:
1614,THE FLUTE,To think that he’d at least one friend
1615,THE FLUTE,"Who’d maybe miss him, in the end."
1616,THE FLUTE,
1617,THE FLUTE,"Then, as we walked, he said no more:"
1618,THE FLUTE,"And, silent, in the starry light,"
1619,THE FLUTE,"Across the wide, sweet-smelling bent,"
1620,THE FLUTE,Between the grass and stars we went
1621,THE FLUTE,"In quiet, friendly company:"
1622,THE FLUTE,"And, all the way, we only heard"
1623,THE FLUTE,"A chirrup where some partridge stirred,"
1624,THE FLUTE,"And ran before us through the grass,"
1625,THE FLUTE,To hide his head till we should pass.
1626,THE FLUTE,
1627,THE FLUTE,"At length, we reached the cottage-door:"
1628,THE FLUTE,"But, when I stopped, and turned to go,"
1629,THE FLUTE,His words came falteringly and slow:
1630,THE FLUTE,"If I would step inside, and rest,"
1631,THE FLUTE,I’d be right welcome: not a guest
1632,THE FLUTE,"Had crossed his threshold, thirty year..."
1633,THE FLUTE,He’d naught but bread and cheese and beer
1634,THE FLUTE,"To offer me ... but, I’d know best..."
1635,THE FLUTE,
1636,THE FLUTE,He spoke with hand upon the latch;
1637,THE FLUTE,"And, when I answered, opened wide"
1638,THE FLUTE,The cottage-door; and stepped inside;
1639,THE FLUTE,"And, as I followed, struck a match,"
1640,THE FLUTE,And lit a tallow-dip: and stirred
1641,THE FLUTE,The banked-up peats into a glow:
1642,THE FLUTE,And then with shuffling step and slow
1643,THE FLUTE,He moved about: and soon had set
1644,THE FLUTE,"Two mugs of beer, and bread and cheese:"
1645,THE FLUTE,"And while we made a meal off these,"
1646,THE FLUTE,The old man never spoke a word;
1647,THE FLUTE,"But, brooding in the ingle-seat,"
1648,THE FLUTE,"With eyes upon the kindling peat,"
1649,THE FLUTE,He seemed awhile to quite forget
1650,THE FLUTE,He was not sitting by himself
1651,THE FLUTE,"To-night, like any other night;"
1652,THE FLUTE,"When, as, in the dim candle-light,"
1653,THE FLUTE,"I glanced around me, with surprise"
1654,THE FLUTE,"I saw, upon the rafter-shelf,"
1655,THE FLUTE,"A flute, nigh hidden in the shade."
1656,THE FLUTE,
1657,THE FLUTE,"And when I asked him if he played,"
1658,THE FLUTE,The light came back into his eyes:
1659,THE FLUTE,"Aye, aye, he sometimes piped a bit,"
1660,THE FLUTE,But not so often since she died.
1661,THE FLUTE,"And then, as though old memories lit"
1662,THE FLUTE,"His poor, old heart, and made it glad,"
1663,THE FLUTE,"He told how he, when quite a lad,"
1664,THE FLUTE,Had taught himself: and they would play
1665,THE FLUTE,On penny whistles all the day--
1666,THE FLUTE,"He and the miller’s son, beside"
1667,THE FLUTE,"The millpool, chirping all they knew,"
1668,THE FLUTE,Till they could whistle clean and true:
1669,THE FLUTE,"And how, when old enough to earn,"
1670,THE FLUTE,They both saved up to buy a flute;
1671,THE FLUTE,"And they had played it, turn for turn:"
1672,THE FLUTE,"But, Jake was dead, this long while back..."
1673,THE FLUTE,"Ah! if I’d only heard him toot,"
1674,THE FLUTE,"I’d know what music meant.  Aye, aye..."
1675,THE FLUTE,"He’d play me something, by-and-bye;"
1676,THE FLUTE,Though he was naught to Jake ... and now
1677,THE FLUTE,"His breath was scant, and fingering slack..."
1678,THE FLUTE,He used to play to her at night
1679,THE FLUTE,"The melodies that she liked best,"
1680,THE FLUTE,While she worked on: she’d never rest
1681,THE FLUTE,"By daylight, or by candle-light..."
1682,THE FLUTE,"And then, with hand upon his brow,"
1683,THE FLUTE,"He brooded, quiet in his chair,"
1684,THE FLUTE,With eyes upon the red peat-glare;
1685,THE FLUTE,"Until, at length, he roused himself,"
1686,THE FLUTE,And reached the flute down from the shelf;
1687,THE FLUTE,"And, carrying it outside the door,"
1688,THE FLUTE,"I saw him take a can, and pour"
1689,THE FLUTE,"Fresh water through the instrument,"
1690,THE FLUTE,"To make it sweet of tone, he said."
1691,THE FLUTE,"Then, in his seat, so old and bent,"
1692,THE FLUTE,"With kindling eyes, and swaying head,"
1693,THE FLUTE,He played the airs he used to play
1694,THE FLUTE,"To please his wife, before she died:"
1695,THE FLUTE,And as I watched his body sway
1696,THE FLUTE,"In time and tune, from side to side,"
1697,THE FLUTE,"So happy, playing, and to please"
1698,THE FLUTE,"With old familiar melodies,"
1699,THE FLUTE,"His eyes grew brighter and more bright,"
1700,THE FLUTE,As though they saw some well-loved sight:
1701,THE FLUTE,"And, following his happy gaze,"
1702,THE FLUTE,"I turned, and saw, without amaze,"
1703,THE FLUTE,"A woman standing, young and fair,"
1704,THE FLUTE,"With hazel eyes, and thick brown hair"
1705,THE FLUTE,"Brushed smoothly backward from the brow,"
1706,THE FLUTE,"Beside the table that but now,"
1707,THE FLUTE,"Save for the empty mugs, was bare."
1708,THE FLUTE,Upon it she had spread a sheet:
1709,THE FLUTE,"And stood there, ironing a shirt,"
1710,THE FLUTE,"Her husband’s, as he played to her"
1711,THE FLUTE,"Her favourite tunes, so old and sweet."
1712,THE FLUTE,I watched her move with soundless stir;
1713,THE FLUTE,"Then stand with listening eyes, and hold"
1714,THE FLUTE,"The iron near her glowing cheek,"
1715,THE FLUTE,"Lest it, too hot, should do some hurt,"
1716,THE FLUTE,"And she, so careful not to burn"
1717,THE FLUTE,"The well-darned shirt, so worn and old."
1718,THE FLUTE,"Then, something seemed to make me turn"
1719,THE FLUTE,To look on the old man again:
1720,THE FLUTE,"And, as I looked, the playing stopped;"
1721,THE FLUTE,And now I saw that he had dropped
1722,THE FLUTE,"Into his brooding mood once more,"
1723,THE FLUTE,With eyes again grown dull and weak.
1724,THE FLUTE,He seemed the oldest of old men
1725,THE FLUTE,Who grope through life with sight worn dim
1726,THE FLUTE,"And, even as I looked at him,"
1727,THE FLUTE,"Too full of tender awe to speak,"
1728,THE FLUTE,"I knew once more the board was bare,"
1729,THE FLUTE,With no young woman standing there
1730,THE FLUTE,"With hazel eyes and thick, brown hair;"
1731,THE FLUTE,"And I, in vain, for her should seek,"
1732,THE FLUTE,If I but sought this side death’s door.
1733,THE FLUTE,
1734,THE FLUTE,"And so, at last, I rose, and took"
1735,THE FLUTE,"His hand: and as he clasped mine tight,"
1736,THE FLUTE,I saw again that friendly look
1737,THE FLUTE,"Fill his old weary eyes with light,"
1738,THE FLUTE,"And wish me, without words, good-night"
1739,THE FLUTE,"And in my heart, that look glowed bright"
1740,THE FLUTE,Till I reached home across the moor.
1741,THE FLUTE,
1742,THE FLUTE,"And, at the corner of the lane,"
1743,THE FLUTE,"Next night, I heard the old voice cry"
1744,THE FLUTE,"In greeting, as I struggled by,"
1745,THE FLUTE,Head-down against the wind and rain.
1746,THE FLUTE,"And so each night, until one day,"
1747,THE FLUTE,His master chanced across my way:
1748,THE FLUTE,"But, when I spoke of him, he said:"
1749,THE FLUTE,"Did I not know the man was dead,"
1750,THE FLUTE,And had been dead a week or so?
1751,THE FLUTE,One morn he’d not turned up to work;
1752,THE FLUTE,And never having known him shirk;
1753,THE FLUTE,And hearing that he lived alone;
1754,THE FLUTE,He thought it best himself to go
1755,THE FLUTE,"And see what ailed: and coming there,"
1756,THE FLUTE,"He found the old man in his chair,"
1757,THE FLUTE,Stone-dead beside the cold hearthstone.
1758,THE FLUTE,"It must be full a week, or more..."
1759,THE FLUTE,"Aye, just two weeks, come Saturday,"
1760,THE FLUTE,He’d found him; but he must have died
1761,THE FLUTE,O’ernight--(the night I heard him play!)
1762,THE FLUTE,"And they had found, dropt by his side,"
1763,THE FLUTE,A broken flute upon the floor.
1764,THE FLUTE,
1765,THE FLUTE,"Yet, every night, his greeting still"
1766,THE FLUTE,"At that same corner of the hill,"
1767,THE FLUTE,"Summer and Winter, wet or dry,"
1768,THE FLUTE,"’Neath cloud, or moon, or cold starlight,"
1769,THE FLUTE,Is waiting there to welcome me:
1770,THE FLUTE,"And ever as I hurry by,"
1771,THE FLUTE,The old voice sings out cheerily:
1772,THE FLUTE,"""Good-night!"" and yet again, ""Good-night!"""
1773,THE FLUTE,
1774,THE FLUTE,1910-1911.
