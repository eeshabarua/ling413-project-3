26,THE KING'S WAKE,
27,THE KING'S WAKE,
28,THE KING'S WAKE,"To-night is the night that the wake they hold,"
29,THE KING'S WAKE,To the wake repair both young and old.
30,THE KING'S WAKE,
31,THE KING'S WAKE,Proud Signelil she her mother address'd:
32,THE KING'S WAKE,"""May I go watch along with the rest?"""
33,THE KING'S WAKE,
34,THE KING'S WAKE,"""O what at the wake wouldst do my dear?"
35,THE KING'S WAKE,Thou'st neither sister nor brother there.
36,THE KING'S WAKE,
37,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Nor brother-in-law to protect thy youth,"
38,THE KING'S WAKE,To the wake thou must not go forsooth.
39,THE KING'S WAKE,
40,THE KING'S WAKE,"""There be the King and his warriors gay,"
41,THE KING'S WAKE,"If me thou list thou at home wilt stay."""
42,THE KING'S WAKE,
43,THE KING'S WAKE,"""But the Queen will be there and her maiden crew,"
44,THE KING'S WAKE,"Pray let me go, mother, the dance to view."""
45,THE KING'S WAKE,
46,THE KING'S WAKE,"So long, so long begged the maiden young,"
47,THE KING'S WAKE,That at length from her mother consent she wrung.
48,THE KING'S WAKE,
49,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Then go, my child, if thou needs must go,"
50,THE KING'S WAKE,"But thy mother ne'er went to the wake I trow."""
51,THE KING'S WAKE,
52,THE KING'S WAKE,"Then through the thick forest the maiden went,"
53,THE KING'S WAKE,To reach the wake her mind was bent.
54,THE KING'S WAKE,
55,THE KING'S WAKE,"When o'er the green meadows she had won,"
56,THE KING'S WAKE,The Queen and her maidens to bed were gone.
57,THE KING'S WAKE,
58,THE KING'S WAKE,And when she came to the castle gate
59,THE KING'S WAKE,They were plying the dance at a furious rate.
60,THE KING'S WAKE,
61,THE KING'S WAKE,"There danced full many a mail-clad man,"
62,THE KING'S WAKE,And the youthful King he led the van.
63,THE KING'S WAKE,
64,THE KING'S WAKE,"He stretched forth his hand with an air so free,"
65,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Wilt dance, thou pretty maid, with me?"""
66,THE KING'S WAKE,
67,THE KING'S WAKE,"""O, sir, I've come across the wold"
68,THE KING'S WAKE,"That I with the Queen discourse might hold."""
69,THE KING'S WAKE,
70,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Come dance,"" said the King with a courteous smile,"
71,THE KING'S WAKE,"""The Queen will be here in a little while."""
72,THE KING'S WAKE,
73,THE KING'S WAKE,"Then forward she stepped like a blushing rose,"
74,THE KING'S WAKE,She takes his hand and to dance she goes.
75,THE KING'S WAKE,
76,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Hear Signelil what I say to thee,"
77,THE KING'S WAKE,"A ditty of love sing thou to me."""
78,THE KING'S WAKE,
79,THE KING'S WAKE,"""A ditty of love I will not, Sir King,"
80,THE KING'S WAKE,"But as well as I can another I'll sing."""
81,THE KING'S WAKE,
82,THE KING'S WAKE,"Proud Signil began, a ditty she sang,"
83,THE KING'S WAKE,To the ears of the Queen in her bed it rang.
84,THE KING'S WAKE,
85,THE KING'S WAKE,Says the Queen in her chamber as she lay:
86,THE KING'S WAKE,"""O which of my maidens doth sing so gay?"
87,THE KING'S WAKE,
88,THE KING'S WAKE,"""O which of my maidens doth sing so late,"
89,THE KING'S WAKE,"To bed why followed they me not straight?"""
90,THE KING'S WAKE,
91,THE KING'S WAKE,"Then answered the Queen the little foot page,"
92,THE KING'S WAKE,"""'Tis none of thy maidens I'll engage."
93,THE KING'S WAKE,
94,THE KING'S WAKE,"""'Tis none I'll engage of the maiden band,"
95,THE KING'S WAKE,"'Tis Signil proud from the islet's strand."""
96,THE KING'S WAKE,
97,THE KING'S WAKE,"""O bring my red mantle hither to me,"
98,THE KING'S WAKE,"For I'll go down this maid to see."""
99,THE KING'S WAKE,
100,THE KING'S WAKE,And when they came down to the castle gate
101,THE KING'S WAKE,The dance it moved at so brave a rate.
102,THE KING'S WAKE,
103,THE KING'S WAKE,"About and around they danced with glee,"
104,THE KING'S WAKE,There stood the Queen and the whole did see.
105,THE KING'S WAKE,
106,THE KING'S WAKE,The Queen she felt so sore aggrieved
107,THE KING'S WAKE,When the King with Signil she perceived.
108,THE KING'S WAKE,
109,THE KING'S WAKE,Sophia the Queen to her maid did sign:
110,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Go fetch me hither a horn of wine."""
111,THE KING'S WAKE,
112,THE KING'S WAKE,His hand the King stretched forth so free:
113,THE KING'S WAKE,"""Wilt thou Sophia my partner be?"""
114,THE KING'S WAKE,
115,THE KING'S WAKE,"""O I'll not dance with thee, I vow,"
116,THE KING'S WAKE,"Unless proud Signil pledge me now."""
117,THE KING'S WAKE,
118,THE KING'S WAKE,"The horn she raised to her lips, athirst,"
119,THE KING'S WAKE,The innocent heart in her bosom burst.
120,THE KING'S WAKE,
121,THE KING'S WAKE,"There stood King Valdemar pale as clay,"
122,THE KING'S WAKE,Stone dead at his feet the maiden lay.
123,THE KING'S WAKE,
124,THE KING'S WAKE,"""A fairer maid since I first drew breath"
125,THE KING'S WAKE,"Ne'er came more guiltless to her death."""
126,THE KING'S WAKE,
127,THE KING'S WAKE,"For her wept woman and maid so sore,"
128,THE KING'S WAKE,To the Church her beauteous corse they bore.
129,THE KING'S WAKE,
130,THE KING'S WAKE,"But better with her it would have sped,"
131,THE KING'S WAKE,Had she but heard what her mother said.
132,THE KING'S WAKE,
133,THE KING'S WAKE,
134,THE KING'S WAKE,
135,THE KING'S WAKE,
136,SWAYNE FELDING,SWAYNE FELDING
137,SWAYNE FELDING,
138,SWAYNE FELDING,
139,SWAYNE FELDING,"Swayne Felding sits at Helsingborg,"
140,SWAYNE FELDING,He tells his deeds with pride;
141,SWAYNE FELDING,"Full blythe at heart I ween he was,"
142,SWAYNE FELDING,His faulchion at his side.
143,SWAYNE FELDING,
144,SWAYNE FELDING,He vows that he on pilgrimage
145,SWAYNE FELDING,To regal Rome will go;
146,SWAYNE FELDING,And many a Danish warrior bold
147,SWAYNE FELDING,Doth make the self same vow.
148,SWAYNE FELDING,
149,SWAYNE FELDING,"So out they rode from Danish land,"
150,SWAYNE FELDING,And only two were they;
151,SWAYNE FELDING,"They stopped to rest them in a town,"
152,SWAYNE FELDING,Its name was Hovdingsey.
153,SWAYNE FELDING,
154,SWAYNE FELDING,"They stopped to rest in a lofty town,"
155,SWAYNE FELDING,Its name was Hovdingsey;
156,SWAYNE FELDING,"They guested with a Damsel proud,"
157,SWAYNE FELDING,A wondrous lovely may.
158,SWAYNE FELDING,
159,SWAYNE FELDING,She placed Swayne highest at the board
160,SWAYNE FELDING,Amidst a knightly band;
161,SWAYNE FELDING,And then wherefrom they two were come
162,SWAYNE FELDING,The Damsel did demand.
163,SWAYNE FELDING,
164,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Thou art no needy pilgrim, Sir,"
165,SWAYNE FELDING,Who honorest us this eve;
166,SWAYNE FELDING,And that can I by thy small shirt
167,SWAYNE FELDING,Hooked with red gold perceive.
168,SWAYNE FELDING,
169,SWAYNE FELDING,"""O I can plain by thy small shirt"
170,SWAYNE FELDING,"With red gold hooked discern,"
171,SWAYNE FELDING,Thou art the King of Denmark come
172,SWAYNE FELDING,"To do us a noble turn."""
173,SWAYNE FELDING,
174,SWAYNE FELDING,"""I am not Denmark's King, fair maid,"
175,SWAYNE FELDING,Nor any thing so high;
176,SWAYNE FELDING,"I'm but a needy pilgrim, born"
177,SWAYNE FELDING,Within the Dane country.
178,SWAYNE FELDING,
179,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now list to me thou Damsel fair,"
180,SWAYNE FELDING,"List kindly I beseech,"
181,SWAYNE FELDING,"There's many a child in Denmark born,"
182,SWAYNE FELDING,"And with his own luck each."""
183,SWAYNE FELDING,
184,SWAYNE FELDING,"And there sat she the damsel fair,"
185,SWAYNE FELDING,And the silken seam she sewed;
186,SWAYNE FELDING,For every stitch she sew'd a tear
187,SWAYNE FELDING,From her eyes of beauty flowed.
188,SWAYNE FELDING,
189,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now do thou hear, my damsel dear,"
190,SWAYNE FELDING,Why dost so sorely grieve?
191,SWAYNE FELDING,If thou declare thy bosom's care
192,SWAYNE FELDING,"Perchance I can relieve."""
193,SWAYNE FELDING,
194,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Within our land a Giant lives"
195,SWAYNE FELDING,Who waste our land will lay;
196,SWAYNE FELDING,Upon no other food than maids
197,SWAYNE FELDING,And ladies will he prey.
198,SWAYNE FELDING,
199,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Within our country lives a trold"
200,SWAYNE FELDING,"From us our land will tear,"
201,SWAYNE FELDING,Unless we can procure a man
202,SWAYNE FELDING,To fight with him will dare.
203,SWAYNE FELDING,
204,SWAYNE FELDING,"""But I have heard in all my days"
205,SWAYNE FELDING,That Danemen know no fear;
206,SWAYNE FELDING,No doubt it is to help us now
207,SWAYNE FELDING,"That God has sent one here."""
208,SWAYNE FELDING,
209,SWAYNE FELDING,"""And had I horse and harness now"
210,SWAYNE FELDING,"Well suited to my back,"
211,SWAYNE FELDING,"Then would I break with him a spear,"
212,SWAYNE FELDING,"Proud damsel, for thy sake."""
213,SWAYNE FELDING,
214,SWAYNE FELDING,"They led three hundred horses forth,"
215,SWAYNE FELDING,Milk white was every one;
216,SWAYNE FELDING,But the first sank down like a messan dog
217,SWAYNE FELDING,That Swayne laid the saddle on.
218,SWAYNE FELDING,
219,SWAYNE FELDING,"They led the Spanish horses forth,"
220,SWAYNE FELDING,Their eyes were very bright;
221,SWAYNE FELDING,"Swayne drew the bridle o'er their heads,"
222,SWAYNE FELDING,And straightway they took fright.
223,SWAYNE FELDING,
224,SWAYNE FELDING,It was the brave Swayne Felding then
225,SWAYNE FELDING,Was sorely sad in mood:
226,SWAYNE FELDING,"""O had I but a Danish horse"
227,SWAYNE FELDING,Who had eat of Denmark's food.
228,SWAYNE FELDING,
229,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Full fifteen golden rings so good"
230,SWAYNE FELDING,"From Denmark I did bring,"
231,SWAYNE FELDING,But for a horse of Jutland breed
232,SWAYNE FELDING,"They every one should spring."""
233,SWAYNE FELDING,
234,SWAYNE FELDING,Then up came striding a millerman
235,SWAYNE FELDING,So gaily o'er the wold:
236,SWAYNE FELDING,"""O I have got a Danish horse,"
237,SWAYNE FELDING,In Denmark he was foal'd.
238,SWAYNE FELDING,
239,SWAYNE FELDING,"""A mottled Danish horse I've got,"
240,SWAYNE FELDING,In Sadbylund was born;
241,SWAYNE FELDING,He bears each time that he goes to mill
242,SWAYNE FELDING,"Full sixty bolls of corn."""
243,SWAYNE FELDING,
244,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now hear thou honest millerman,"
245,SWAYNE FELDING,"Let me this same horse see,"
246,SWAYNE FELDING,For if we both be Daners born
247,SWAYNE FELDING,"We'll beat Italians three."""
248,SWAYNE FELDING,
249,SWAYNE FELDING,"Then forth was led the miller's horse,"
250,SWAYNE FELDING,He look'd a very Dane;
251,SWAYNE FELDING,"High hip, broad chest, the saddle gilt"
252,SWAYNE FELDING,Upon his back laid Swayne.
253,SWAYNE FELDING,
254,SWAYNE FELDING,"Away he cast his gloves so small,"
255,SWAYNE FELDING,His hands were white to see;
256,SWAYNE FELDING,"And he himself girded the noble horse,"
257,SWAYNE FELDING,The groom ne'er trusted he.
258,SWAYNE FELDING,
259,SWAYNE FELDING,"He girded the horse with a saddle girth,"
260,SWAYNE FELDING,He girded him with three;
261,SWAYNE FELDING,The horse he gave a single shake
262,SWAYNE FELDING,And all broke instantly.
263,SWAYNE FELDING,
264,SWAYNE FELDING,He girded the steed where he was most thick
265,SWAYNE FELDING,"With such tremendous force,"
266,SWAYNE FELDING,"That the girth did fly into pieces ten,"
267,SWAYNE FELDING,And fell on his knee the horse.
268,SWAYNE FELDING,
269,SWAYNE FELDING,"""With fifteen golden rings so good"
270,SWAYNE FELDING,"From Denmark out I sped,"
271,SWAYNE FELDING,But I with every one would part
272,SWAYNE FELDING,Got I a good girth instead.
273,SWAYNE FELDING,
274,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Send ye a message o'er the mead"
275,SWAYNE FELDING,"Unto the beauteous lady,"
276,SWAYNE FELDING,And beg her for her champion's steed
277,SWAYNE FELDING,"To get a new girth ready."""
278,SWAYNE FELDING,
279,SWAYNE FELDING,Full fifteen were the Damsels proud
280,SWAYNE FELDING,"Who wove the ruddy gold,"
281,SWAYNE FELDING,And formed with care a saddle girth
282,SWAYNE FELDING,Swayne Felding's horse to hold.
283,SWAYNE FELDING,
284,SWAYNE FELDING,"The maids of Hammer, the maids of Pommer,"
285,SWAYNE FELDING,"And many more maids with heed,"
286,SWAYNE FELDING,Wove silk and gold to form a girth
287,SWAYNE FELDING,For the mottled Danish steed.
288,SWAYNE FELDING,
289,SWAYNE FELDING,The saddle girth was ready and made
290,SWAYNE FELDING,By the early morning tide;
291,SWAYNE FELDING,"'Twas seven ells long, and a quarter thick,"
292,SWAYNE FELDING,And more than five span wide.
293,SWAYNE FELDING,
294,SWAYNE FELDING,But when the horse he girded was
295,SWAYNE FELDING,"So fierce he ramped and reared,"
296,SWAYNE FELDING,That there was none of Austria's men
297,SWAYNE FELDING,But to look upon him feared.
298,SWAYNE FELDING,
299,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now do thou hear thou gallant horse,"
300,SWAYNE FELDING,"I think thou'st human wit,"
301,SWAYNE FELDING,Before I mount thy back upon
302,SWAYNE FELDING,I thee will ease a bit.
303,SWAYNE FELDING,
304,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now do thy best, my gallant horse,"
305,SWAYNE FELDING,Who like a buck dost play;
306,SWAYNE FELDING,"Here may ye see, ye German knights,"
307,SWAYNE FELDING,Of Danish men the way.
308,SWAYNE FELDING,
309,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now take away the crowned sword,"
310,SWAYNE FELDING,To bear it would break my vow;
311,SWAYNE FELDING,"And fetch ye hither a vessel's mast,"
312,SWAYNE FELDING,"I'll wield it well I trow."""
313,SWAYNE FELDING,
314,SWAYNE FELDING,The first course they together rode
315,SWAYNE FELDING,"The Trold show'd mighty force,"
316,SWAYNE FELDING,"Their splintered spears a furlong flew,"
317,SWAYNE FELDING,And down fell either horse.
318,SWAYNE FELDING,
319,SWAYNE FELDING,"""I would but prove my horse's strength,"
320,SWAYNE FELDING,I call not this a fight;
321,SWAYNE FELDING,But meet me here tomorrow's morn
322,SWAYNE FELDING,"And harder thee I'll smite."""
323,SWAYNE FELDING,
324,SWAYNE FELDING,"Swayne Felding took the sacrament,"
325,SWAYNE FELDING,And round the churchyard paced;
326,SWAYNE FELDING,Within his acton next his breast
327,SWAYNE FELDING,The holy host he placed.
328,SWAYNE FELDING,
329,SWAYNE FELDING,"""And do thou hear, my Damsel fair,"
330,SWAYNE FELDING,Be never down at heart;
331,SWAYNE FELDING,Either shall he the saddle quit
332,SWAYNE FELDING,"Or his tough neck shall start."""
333,SWAYNE FELDING,
334,SWAYNE FELDING,Out of the city followed him
335,SWAYNE FELDING,Alike both man and dame:
336,SWAYNE FELDING,"""O may God grant,"" the people said,"
337,SWAYNE FELDING,"""The Knight his foe may tame!"""
338,SWAYNE FELDING,
339,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Now hand me not the puny lance"
340,SWAYNE FELDING,Which ye are wont to bear;
341,SWAYNE FELDING,"But do ye bring, for me to wield,"
342,SWAYNE FELDING,"My native country's spear."""
343,SWAYNE FELDING,
344,SWAYNE FELDING,And now the second course they ride
345,SWAYNE FELDING,Their cheeks with fury red;
346,SWAYNE FELDING,"The Devil's neck asunder went,"
347,SWAYNE FELDING,Flew o'er the mead his head.
348,SWAYNE FELDING,
349,SWAYNE FELDING,"His head flew into pieces nine,"
350,SWAYNE FELDING,His back asunder burst;
351,SWAYNE FELDING,"Swayne hied him to the Damsel's house,"
352,SWAYNE FELDING,There first he quenched his thirst.
353,SWAYNE FELDING,
354,SWAYNE FELDING,"Nine stately warriors out there came,"
355,SWAYNE FELDING,Took Swayne from off his steed:
356,SWAYNE FELDING,"""Broad lands on thee we will bestow"
357,SWAYNE FELDING,"If thou wilt wed the maid."""
358,SWAYNE FELDING,
359,SWAYNE FELDING,"""O I'm betrothed to one as fair"
360,SWAYNE FELDING,In Ostland realms already;
361,SWAYNE FELDING,For seven tons of ruddy gold
362,SWAYNE FELDING,I would not prove unsteady.
363,SWAYNE FELDING,
364,SWAYNE FELDING,"""But build before your Hovdingsey"
365,SWAYNE FELDING,"A house upon the mead,"
366,SWAYNE FELDING,And there to Danish pilgrims give
367,SWAYNE FELDING,"Good wine and best of bread."""
368,SWAYNE FELDING,
369,SWAYNE FELDING,So Danish pilgrims there they give
370,SWAYNE FELDING,Good wine and best of bread;
371,SWAYNE FELDING,"They pray for brave Swayne Felding's soul,"
372,SWAYNE FELDING,He now has long been dead.
373,SWAYNE FELDING,

377,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,INNOCENCE DEFAMED
378,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
379,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
380,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Misfortune comes to every door,"
381,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And who can hope to 'scape its might?
382,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And that can little Kirstine say,"
383,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And none alas with greater right.
384,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
385,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"It was the good Sir Peter, he"
386,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,At fall of eve came home from Ting;
387,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And it was little Kirstine fair,"
388,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,That fell the knight to welcoming.
389,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
390,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""Now welcome, welcome home from Ting,"
391,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Most welcome thou my father dear;
392,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Whilst thou at Ting this day didst stand
393,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Didst any news or tiding hear?"""
394,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
395,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""Enough of tidings I have heard,"
396,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,To break my heart however sound;
397,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Thy plighted youth has thee forsworn
398,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Because thy name was bandied round.
399,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
400,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""Thy plighted youth has thee forsworn,"
401,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And none can blame the youth I ween;
402,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,For eight long years it seems thou hast
403,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"A murdress and a harlot been."""
404,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
405,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""Now do thou hear, my father dear,"
406,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Such wicked rumours thou shouldst scorn;
407,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,For thus is many a virtuous maid
408,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Of fame and honor daily shorn."""
409,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
410,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""And do thou hear, my daughter dear,"
411,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Thou shalt confess it to thy sorrow;
412,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"This evening thou shalt gather wood,"
413,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And burn upon that wood tomorrow."""
414,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
415,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And so they took the fair Kirstine,"
416,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And her arrayed in scarlet weed;
417,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And mournfully they lifted her
418,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,Upon the grey and lofty steed.
419,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
420,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"It was little Kirstine fair,"
421,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,She reached at last the verdant wold;
422,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""Now bless'd be God on high that dwells,"
423,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,My bride-bed yonder I behold.
424,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
425,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""So red, red are my bridal sheets,"
426,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"My bridal bolsters are so blue,"
427,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,The knights who thus their daughters wed
428,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"I hope and trust are very few."""
429,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
430,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And so they took the little Kirstine,"
431,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And bade her sit a stump upon:
432,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Then forward stepped her plighted youth,"
433,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And her yellow hair he has undone.
434,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
435,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""Now do thou hear, my plighted maid,"
436,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"I rede thee be of blythesome cheer,"
437,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"For thou, I ween, dost here perceive"
438,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Thy bride-bed and thy funeral bier."""
439,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
440,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,When she had sat a little space
441,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,No longer there she cared to wait;
442,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Now stand thou up, Sir Archbishop,"
443,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And Kirstine's bride-bed consecrate.
444,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
445,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,The little Kirstine then they took
446,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And midst the roaring blazes threw;
447,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"The fire recoiled on every side,"
448,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,So fair and bright she stood to view.
449,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
450,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"""I thank the God who me has helped,"
451,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,The God who made the earth and sky;
452,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Now to a cloister I will go,"
453,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And serve my master till I die."""
454,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
455,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"And thither little Kirstine went,"
456,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And with her all her maidens fair;
457,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,"Her father and her plighted youth,"
458,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,They quickly died of grief and care.
459,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,
460,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,And now within the cloister wall
461,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,The beauteous little Kirstine goes;
462,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,So joyous o'er her yellow hair
463,INNOCENCE DEFAMED,The veil so long and black she throws.
