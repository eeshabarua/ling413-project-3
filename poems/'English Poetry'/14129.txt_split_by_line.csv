298,CHAPTER I.,CHAPTER I.
299,CHAPTER I.,
300,CHAPTER I.,
301,CHAPTER I.,It was noontide. The sun was very hot. An old gentlewoman sat
302,CHAPTER I.,spinning in a little arbor at the door of her cottage. She was blind;
303,CHAPTER I.,and her granddaughter was reading the Bible to her. The old lady had
304,CHAPTER I.,"just left her work, to attend to the story of Ruth."
305,CHAPTER I.,
306,CHAPTER I.,"""Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her."" It was a"
307,CHAPTER I.,passage she could not let pass without a _comment_. The moral she
308,CHAPTER I.,"drew from it was not very _new_, to be sure. The girl had heard it a"
309,CHAPTER I.,hundred times before--and a hundred times more she could have heard
310,CHAPTER I.,"it, without suspecting it to be tedious. Rosamund loved her"
311,CHAPTER I.,grandmother.
312,CHAPTER I.,
313,CHAPTER I.,The old lady loved Rosamund too; and she had reason for so doing.
314,CHAPTER I.,Rosamund was to her at once a child and a servant. She had only _her_
315,CHAPTER I.,left in the world. They two lived together.
316,CHAPTER I.,
317,CHAPTER I.,"They had once known better days. The story of Rosamund's parents,"
318,CHAPTER I.,"their failure, their folly, and distresses, may be told another time."
319,CHAPTER I.,Our tale hath grief enough in it.
320,CHAPTER I.,
321,CHAPTER I.,It was now about a year and a half since old Margaret Gray had sold
322,CHAPTER I.,"off all her effects, to pay the debts of Rosamund's father--just"
323,CHAPTER I.,after the mother had died of a broken heart; for her husband had fled
324,CHAPTER I.,his country to hide his shame in a foreign land. At that period the
325,CHAPTER I.,old lady retired to a small cottage in the village of Widford in
326,CHAPTER I.,Hertfordshire.
327,CHAPTER I.,
328,CHAPTER I.,"Rosamund, in her thirteenth year, was left destitute, without fortune"
329,CHAPTER I.,or friends: she went with her grandmother. In all this time she had
330,CHAPTER I.,served her faithfully and lovingly.
331,CHAPTER I.,
332,CHAPTER I.,"Old Margaret Gray, when she first came into these parts, had eyes,"
333,CHAPTER I.,"and could see. The neighbors said, they had been dimmed by weeping:"
334,CHAPTER I.,"be that as it may, she was latterly grown quite blind. ""God is very"
335,CHAPTER I.,"good to us, child; I can _feel_ you yet."" This she would sometimes"
336,CHAPTER I.,"say; and we need not wonder to hear, that Rosamund clave unto her"
337,CHAPTER I.,grandmother.
338,CHAPTER I.,
339,CHAPTER I.,Margaret retained a spirit unbroken by calamity. There was a
340,CHAPTER I.,"principle _within_, which it seemed as if no outward circumstances"
341,CHAPTER I.,"could reach. It was a _religious_ principle, and she had taught it to"
342,CHAPTER I.,Rosamund; for the girl had mostly resided with her grandmother from
343,CHAPTER I.,her earliest years. Indeed she had taught her all that she knew
344,CHAPTER I.,herself; and the old lady's knowledge did not extend a vast way.
345,CHAPTER I.,
346,CHAPTER I.,Margaret had drawn her maxims from observation; and a pretty long
347,CHAPTER I.,"experience in life had contributed to make her, at times, a little"
348,CHAPTER I.,_positive:_ but Rosamund never argued with her grandmother.
349,CHAPTER I.,
350,CHAPTER I.,"Their library consisted chiefly in a large family Bible, with notes"
351,CHAPTER I.,"and expositions by various learned expositors, from Bishop Jewell"
352,CHAPTER I.,downwards.
353,CHAPTER I.,
354,CHAPTER I.,"This might never be suffered to lie about like other books, but was"
355,CHAPTER I.,"kept constantly wrapt up in a handsome case of green velvet, with"
356,CHAPTER I.,gold tassels--the only relic of departed grandeur they had brought
357,CHAPTER I.,with them to the cottage--everything else of value had been sold off
358,CHAPTER I.,for the purpose above mentioned.
359,CHAPTER I.,
360,CHAPTER I.,"This Bible Rosamund, when a child, had never dared to open without"
361,CHAPTER I.,"permission; and even yet, from habit, continued the custom. Margaret"
362,CHAPTER I.,had parted with none of her _authority_; indeed it was never exerted
363,CHAPTER I.,"with much harshness; and happy was Rosamund, though a girl grown,"
364,CHAPTER I.,when she could obtain leave to read her Bible. It was a treasure too
365,CHAPTER I.,valuable for an indiscriminate use; and Margaret still pointed out to
366,CHAPTER I.,her grand-daughter _where to read._
367,CHAPTER I.,
368,CHAPTER I.,"Besides this, they had the ""Complete Angler, or Contemplative Man's"
369,CHAPTER I.,"Recreation,"" with cuts--""Pilgrim's Progress,"" the first part--a"
370,CHAPTER I.,"Cookery Book, with a few dry sprigs of rosemary and lavender stuck"
371,CHAPTER I.,"here and there between the leaves, (I suppose to point to some of the"
372,CHAPTER I.,"old lady's most favorite receipts,) and there was ""Wither's Emblems,"""
373,CHAPTER I.,"an old book, and quaint. The old-fashioned pictures in this last book"
374,CHAPTER I.,were among the first exciters of the infant Rosamund's curiosity. Her
375,CHAPTER I.,contemplation had fed upon them in rather older years.
376,CHAPTER I.,
377,CHAPTER I.,"Rosamund had not read many books besides these; or if any, they had"
378,CHAPTER I.,been only occasional companions: these were to Rosamund as old
379,CHAPTER I.,"friends, that she had long known. I know not whether the peculiar"
380,CHAPTER I.,"cast of her mind might not be traced, in part, to a tincture she had"
381,CHAPTER I.,"received, early in life, from Walton and Wither, from John Bunyan and"
382,CHAPTER I.,her Bible.
383,CHAPTER I.,
384,CHAPTER I.,"Rosamund's mind was pensive and reflective, rather than what passes"
385,CHAPTER I.,usually for _clever_ or _acute_. From a child she was remarkably shy
386,CHAPTER I.,and thoughtful--this was taken for stupidity and want of feeling; and
387,CHAPTER I.,"the child has been sometimes whipt for being a _stubborn thing_, when"
388,CHAPTER I.,her little heart was almost bursting with affection.
389,CHAPTER I.,
390,CHAPTER I.,"Even now her grandmother would often reprove her, when she found her"
391,CHAPTER I.,too grave or melancholy; give her sprightly lectures about good-humor
392,CHAPTER I.,"and rational mirth; and not unfrequently fall a-crying herself, to"
393,CHAPTER I.,the great discredit of her lecture. Those tears endeared her the more
394,CHAPTER I.,to Rosamund.
395,CHAPTER I.,
396,CHAPTER I.,"Margaret would say, ""Child, I love you to cry, when I think you are"
397,CHAPTER I.,only remembering your poor dear father and mother;--I would have you
398,CHAPTER I.,think about them sometimes--it would be strange if you did not; but I
399,CHAPTER I.,"fear, Rosamund--I fear, girl, you sometimes think too deeply about"
400,CHAPTER I.,"your own situation and poor prospects in life. When you do so, you do"
401,CHAPTER I.,wrong--remember the naughty rich man in the parable. He never had any
402,CHAPTER I.,"good thoughts about God, and his religion: and that might have been"
403,CHAPTER I.,"your case."""
404,CHAPTER I.,
405,CHAPTER I.,"Rosamund, at these times, could not reply to her; she was not in the"
406,CHAPTER I.,habit of _arguing_ with her grandmother; so she was quite silent on
407,CHAPTER I.,"these occasions--or else the girl knew well enough herself, that she"
408,CHAPTER I.,had only been sad to think of the desolate condition of her best
409,CHAPTER I.,"friend, to see her, in her old age, so infirm and blind. But she had"
410,CHAPTER I.,"never been used to make excuses, when the old lady said she was doing"
411,CHAPTER I.,wrong.
412,CHAPTER I.,
413,CHAPTER I.,The neighbors were all very kind to them. The veriest rustics never
414,CHAPTER I.,"passed them without a bow, or a pulling off of the hat--some show of"
415,CHAPTER I.,"courtesy, awkward indeed, but affectionate--with a ""Good-morrow,"
416,CHAPTER I.,"madam,"" or ""young madam,"" as it might happen."
417,CHAPTER I.,
418,CHAPTER I.,"Rude and savage natures, who seem born with a propensity to express"
419,CHAPTER I.,"contempt for anything that looks like prosperity, yet felt respect"
420,CHAPTER I.,for its declining lustre.
421,CHAPTER I.,
422,CHAPTER I.,"The farmers, and better sort of people, (as they are called,) all"
423,CHAPTER I.,promised to provide for Rosamund when her grandmother should die.
424,CHAPTER I.,Margaret trusted in God and believed them.
425,CHAPTER I.,
426,CHAPTER I.,"She used to say, ""I have lived many years in the world, and have"
427,CHAPTER I.,"never known people, _good people_, to be left without some friend; a"
428,CHAPTER I.,"relation, a benefactor, a _something_. God knows our wants--that it"
429,CHAPTER I.,is not good for man or woman to be alone; and he always sends us a
430,CHAPTER I.,"helpmate, a leaning place, a _somewhat_."" Upon this sure ground of"
431,CHAPTER I.,"experience, did Margaret build her trust in Providence."

438,CHAPTER II.,
439,CHAPTER II.,
440,CHAPTER II.,"Rosamund had just made an end of her story, (as I was about to"
441,CHAPTER II.,"relate,) and was listening to the application of the moral, (which"
442,CHAPTER II.,"said application she was old enough to have made herself, but her"
443,CHAPTER II.,"grandmother still continued to treat her, in many respects, as a"
444,CHAPTER II.,"child, and Rosamund was in no haste to lay claim to the title of"
445,CHAPTER II.,"womanhood,) when a young gentleman made his appearance and"
446,CHAPTER II.,interrupted them.
447,CHAPTER II.,
448,CHAPTER II.,"It was young Allan Clare, who had brought a present of peaches, and"
449,CHAPTER II.,some roses for Rosamund.
450,CHAPTER II.,
451,CHAPTER II.,He laid his little basket down on a seat of the arbor; and in a
452,CHAPTER II.,"respectful tone of voice, as though he were addressing a parent,"
453,CHAPTER II.,"inquired of Margaret ""how she did."""
454,CHAPTER II.,
455,CHAPTER II.,The old lady seemed pleased with his attentions--answered his
456,CHAPTER II.,"inquiries by saying, that ""her cough was less troublesome a-nights,"
457,CHAPTER II.,"but she had not yet got rid of it, and probably she never might; but"
458,CHAPTER II.,she did not like to tease young people with an account of her
459,CHAPTER II.,"infirmities."""
460,CHAPTER II.,
461,CHAPTER II.,"A few kind words passed on either side, when young Clare, glancing a"
462,CHAPTER II.,"tender look at the girl, who had all this time been silent, took"
463,CHAPTER II.,"leave of them with saying, ""I shall bring _Elinor_ to see you in the"
464,CHAPTER II.,"evening."""
465,CHAPTER II.,
466,CHAPTER II.,"When he was gone, the old lady began to prattle."
467,CHAPTER II.,
468,CHAPTER II.,"""That is a sweet-dispositioned youth, and I _do_ love him dearly, I"
469,CHAPTER II.,must say it--there is such a modesty in all he says or does--he
470,CHAPTER II.,"should not come here so often, to be sure, but I don't know how to"
471,CHAPTER II.,"help it; there is so much goodness in him, I can't find it in my"
472,CHAPTER II.,"heart to forbid him. But, Rosamund, girl, I must tell you beforehand;"
473,CHAPTER II.,"when you grow older, Mr. Clare must be no companion for _you_: while"
474,CHAPTER II.,"you were both so young it was all very well--but the time is coming,"
475,CHAPTER II.,"when folks will think harm of it, if a rich young gentleman, like Mr."
476,CHAPTER II.,"Clare, comes so often to our poor cottage.--Dost hear, girl? Why"
477,CHAPTER II.,"don't you answer? Come, I did not mean to say anything to hurt"
478,CHAPTER II.,"you--speak to me, Rosamund--nay, I must not have you be sullen--I"
479,CHAPTER II.,"don't love people that are sullen."""
480,CHAPTER II.,
481,CHAPTER II.,"And in this manner was this poor soul running on, unheard and"
482,CHAPTER II.,"unheeded, when it occurred to her, that possibly the girl might not"
483,CHAPTER II.,be _within hearing_.
484,CHAPTER II.,
485,CHAPTER II.,"And true it was, that Rosamund had slunk away at the first mention of"
486,CHAPTER II.,"Mr. Clare's good qualities: and when she returned, which was not till"
487,CHAPTER II.,"a few minutes after Margaret had made an end of her fine harangue, it"
488,CHAPTER II.,is certain her cheeks _did_ look very _rosy_. That might have been
489,CHAPTER II.,"from the heat of the day or from exercise, for she had been walking"
490,CHAPTER II.,in the garden.
491,CHAPTER II.,
492,CHAPTER II.,"Margaret, we know, was blind; and, in this case, it was lucky for"
493,CHAPTER II.,"Rosamund that she was so, or she might have made some not unlikely"
494,CHAPTER II.,surmises.
495,CHAPTER II.,
496,CHAPTER II.,"I must not have my reader infer from this, that I at all think it"
497,CHAPTER II.,"likely, a young maid of fourteen would fall in love without asking"
498,CHAPTER II.,her grandmother's leave--the thing itself is not to be conceived.
499,CHAPTER II.,
500,CHAPTER II.,"To obviate all suspicions, I am disposed to communicate a little"
501,CHAPTER II.,anecdote of Rosamund.
502,CHAPTER II.,
503,CHAPTER II.,A month or two back her grandmother had been giving her the strictest
504,CHAPTER II.,"prohibitions, in her walks, not to go near a certain spot, which was"
505,CHAPTER II.,dangerous from the circumstance of a huge overgrown oak-tree
506,CHAPTER II.,"spreading its prodigious arms across a deep chalk-pit, which they"
507,CHAPTER II.,partly concealed.
508,CHAPTER II.,
509,CHAPTER II.,"To this fatal place Rosamund came one day--female curiosity, we know,"
510,CHAPTER II.,"is older than the flood--let us not think hardly of the girl, if she"
511,CHAPTER II.,partook of the sexual failing.
512,CHAPTER II.,
513,CHAPTER II.,Rosamund ventured further and further--climbed along one of the
514,CHAPTER II.,branches--approached the forbidden chasm--her foot slipped--she was
515,CHAPTER II.,not killed--but it was by a mercy she escaped--other branches
516,CHAPTER II.,intercepted her fall--and with a palpitating heart she made her way
517,CHAPTER II.,back to the cottage.
518,CHAPTER II.,
519,CHAPTER II.,"It happened that evening, that her grandmother was in one of her best"
520,CHAPTER II.,"humors, caressed Rosamund, talked of old times, and what a blessing"
521,CHAPTER II.,"it was they two found a shelter in their little cottage, and in"
522,CHAPTER II.,"conclusion told Rosamund, ""she was a good girl, and God would one day"
523,CHAPTER II.,"reward her for her kindness to her old blind grandmother."""
524,CHAPTER II.,
525,CHAPTER II.,This was more than Rosamund could bear. Her morning's disobedience
526,CHAPTER II.,came fresh into her mind; she felt she did not deserve all this from
527,CHAPTER II.,"Margaret, and at last burst into a fit of crying, and made confession"
528,CHAPTER II.,of her fault. The old gentlewoman kissed and forgave her.
529,CHAPTER II.,
530,CHAPTER II.,Rosamund never went near that naughty chasm again.
531,CHAPTER II.,
532,CHAPTER II.,"Margaret would never have heard of this, if Rosamund had not told of"
533,CHAPTER II.,"it herself. But this young maid had a delicate moral sense, which"
534,CHAPTER II.,"would not suffer her to take advantage of her grandmother, to deceive"
535,CHAPTER II.,"her, or conceal anything from her, though Margaret was old, and"
536,CHAPTER II.,"blind, and easy to be imposed upon."
537,CHAPTER II.,
538,CHAPTER II.,"Another virtuous _trait_ I recollect of Rosamund, and now I am in the"
539,CHAPTER II.,vein will tell it.
540,CHAPTER II.,
541,CHAPTER II.,"Some, I know, will think these things trifles--and they are so--but"
542,CHAPTER II.,"if these _minutiæ_ make my reader better acquainted with Rosamund, I"
543,CHAPTER II.,am content to abide the imputation.
544,CHAPTER II.,
545,CHAPTER II.,"These promises of character, hints, and early indications of a _sweet"
546,CHAPTER II.,"nature_, are to me more dear, and choice in the selection, than any"
547,CHAPTER II.,"of those pretty wild flowers, which this young maid, this virtuous"
548,CHAPTER II.,"Rosamund, has ever gathered in a fine May morning, to make a posy to"
549,CHAPTER II.,place in the bosom of her old blind friend.
550,CHAPTER II.,
551,CHAPTER II.,"Rosamund had a very just notion of drawing, and would often employ"
552,CHAPTER II.,her talent in making sketches of the surrounding scenery.
553,CHAPTER II.,
554,CHAPTER II.,"On a landscape, a larger piece than she had ever yet attempted, she"
555,CHAPTER II.,had now been working for three or four months. She had taken great
556,CHAPTER II.,"pains with it, given much time to it, and it was nearly finished. For"
557,CHAPTER II.,"_whose_ particular inspection it was designed, I will not venture to"
558,CHAPTER II.,conjecture. We know it could not have been for her grandmother's.
559,CHAPTER II.,
560,CHAPTER II.,"One day she went out on a short errand, and left her landscape on the"
561,CHAPTER II.,"table. When she returned, she found it _gone_."
562,CHAPTER II.,
563,CHAPTER II.,"Rosamund from the first suspected some mischief, but held her tongue."
564,CHAPTER II.,"At length she made the fatal discovery. Margaret, in her absence, had"
565,CHAPTER II.,"laid violent hands on it; not knowing what it was, but taking it for"
566,CHAPTER II.,"some waste-paper, had torn it in half, and with one half of this"
567,CHAPTER II.,elaborate composition had twisted herself up--a thread-paper!
568,CHAPTER II.,
569,CHAPTER II.,"Rosamund spread out her hands at sight of the disaster, gave her"
570,CHAPTER II.,"grandmother a roguish smile, but said not a word. She knew the poor"
571,CHAPTER II.,"soul would only fret, if she told her of it,--and when once Margaret"
572,CHAPTER II.,"was set a fretting for other people's misfortunes, the fit held her"
573,CHAPTER II.,pretty long.
574,CHAPTER II.,
575,CHAPTER II.,So Rosamund that very afternoon began another piece of the same size
576,CHAPTER II.,"and subject; and Margaret, to her dying day, never dreamed of the"
577,CHAPTER II.,mischief she had unconsciously done.

589,CHAPTER III,
590,CHAPTER III,There was a sort of melancholy mingled in her smile. It was not the
591,CHAPTER III,thoughtless levity of a girl--it was not the restrained simper of

593,CHAPTER III,"remembered, when he composed that perfect line,"

657,CHAPTER IV.,
658,CHAPTER IV.,Allan Clare was just two years older than Rosamund. He was a boy of
659,CHAPTER IV.,"fourteen, when he first became acquainted with her--it was soon after"
660,CHAPTER IV.,she had come to reside with her grandmother at Widford.
661,CHAPTER IV.,
662,CHAPTER IV.,"He met her by chance one day, carrying a pitcher in her hand, which"
663,CHAPTER IV.,"she had been filling from a neighboring well--the pitcher was heavy,"
664,CHAPTER IV.,and she seemed to be bending with its weight.
665,CHAPTER IV.,
666,CHAPTER IV.,Allan insisted on carrying it for her--for he thought it a sin that a
667,CHAPTER IV.,"delicate young maid, like her, should be so employed, and he stand"
668,CHAPTER IV.,idle by.
669,CHAPTER IV.,
670,CHAPTER IV.,Allan had a propensity to do little kind offices for everybody--but
671,CHAPTER IV.,"at the sight of Rosamund Gray, his first fire was kindled--his young"
672,CHAPTER IV.,"mind seemed to have found an object, and his enthusiasm was from that"
673,CHAPTER IV.,"time forth awakened. His visits, from that day, were pretty frequent"
674,CHAPTER IV.,at the cottage.
675,CHAPTER IV.,
676,CHAPTER IV.,He was never happier than when he could get Rosamund to walk out with
677,CHAPTER IV.,him. He would make her admire the scenes he admired--fancy the wild
678,CHAPTER IV.,flowers he fancied--watch the clouds he was watching--and not
679,CHAPTER IV.,"unfrequently repeat to her poetry which he loved, and make her love"
680,CHAPTER IV.,it.
681,CHAPTER IV.,
682,CHAPTER IV.,"On their return, the old lady, who considered them yet as but"
683,CHAPTER IV.,"children, would bid Rosamund fetch Mr. Clare a glass of her"
684,CHAPTER IV.,"currant-wine, a bowl of new milk, or some cheap dainty which was more"
685,CHAPTER IV.,welcome to Allan than the costliest delicacies of a prince's court.
686,CHAPTER IV.,
687,CHAPTER IV.,"The boy and girl, for they were no more at that age, grew fond of"
688,CHAPTER IV.,each other--more fond than either of them suspected.
689,CHAPTER IV.,
690,CHAPTER IV.,"""They would sit, and sigh,"
691,CHAPTER IV.,"And look upon each other, and conceive"
692,CHAPTER IV.,"Not what they ail'd; yet something they did ail,"

698,CHAPTER IV.,"""In this first garden of their simpleness"
699,CHAPTER IV.,"They spent their childhood."""

701,CHAPTER IV.,"A circumstance had lately happened, which in some sort altered the"
702,CHAPTER IV.,nature of their attachment.
703,CHAPTER IV.,
704,CHAPTER IV.,"Rosamund was one day reading the tale of ""Julia de Roubignè""--a book"
705,CHAPTER IV.,which young Clare had lent her.
706,CHAPTER IV.,
707,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan was standing by, looking over her, with one hand thrown round"
708,CHAPTER IV.,"her neck, and a finger of the other pointing to a passage in Julia's"
709,CHAPTER IV.,third letter.
710,CHAPTER IV.,
711,CHAPTER IV.,"""Maria! in my hours of visionary indulgence, I have sometimes painted"
712,CHAPTER IV.,to myself a _husband_--no matter whom--comforting me amidst the
713,CHAPTER IV.,distresses which fortune had laid upon us. I have smiled upon him
714,CHAPTER IV.,"through my tears; tears, not of anguish, but of tenderness!--our"
715,CHAPTER IV.,"children were playing around us, unconscious of misfortune; we had"
716,CHAPTER IV.,"taught them to be humble, and to be happy; our little shed was"
717,CHAPTER IV.,"reserved to us, and their smiles to cheer it.--I have imagined the"
718,CHAPTER IV.,"luxury of such a scene, and affliction became a part of my dream of"
719,CHAPTER IV.,"happiness."""
720,CHAPTER IV.,
721,CHAPTER IV.,"The girl blushed as she read, and trembled--she had a sort of"
722,CHAPTER IV.,"confused sensation, that Allan was noticing her--yet she durst not"
723,CHAPTER IV.,"lift her eyes from the book, but continued reading, scarce knowing"
724,CHAPTER IV.,what she read.
725,CHAPTER IV.,
726,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan guessed the cause of her confusion, Allan trembled too--his"
727,CHAPTER IV.,color came and went--his feelings became impetuous--and flinging both
728,CHAPTER IV.,"arms round her neck, he kissed his young favorite."
729,CHAPTER IV.,
730,CHAPTER IV.,"Rosamund was vexed and pleased, soothed and frightened, all in a"
731,CHAPTER IV.,moment--a fit of tears came to her relief.
732,CHAPTER IV.,
733,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan had indulged before in these little freedoms, and Rosamund had"
734,CHAPTER IV.,thought no harm of them; but from this time the girl grew timid and
735,CHAPTER IV.,"reserved--distant in her manner, and careful of her behavior in"
736,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan's presence--not seeking his society as before, but rather"
737,CHAPTER IV.,shunning it--delighting more to feed upon his idea in absence.
738,CHAPTER IV.,
739,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan too, from this day, seemed changed: his manner became, though"
740,CHAPTER IV.,"not less tender, yet more respectful and diffident--his bosom felt a"
741,CHAPTER IV.,"throb it had till now not known, in the society of Rosamund--and, if"
742,CHAPTER IV.,"he was less familiar with her than in former times, that charm of"
743,CHAPTER IV.,"delicacy had superadded a grace to Rosamund, which, while he feared,"
744,CHAPTER IV.,he loved.
745,CHAPTER IV.,
746,CHAPTER IV.,"There is a _mysterious character_, heightened, indeed, by fancy and"
747,CHAPTER IV.,"passion, but not without foundation in reality and observation, which"
748,CHAPTER IV.,true lovers have ever imputed to the object of their affections. This
749,CHAPTER IV.,"character Rosamund had now acquired with Allan--something _angelic,"
750,CHAPTER IV.,"perfect, exceeding nature._"
751,CHAPTER IV.,
752,CHAPTER IV.,"Young Clare dwelt very near to the cottage. He had lost his parents,"
753,CHAPTER IV.,"who were rather wealthy, early in life; and was left to the care of a"
754,CHAPTER IV.,sister some ten years older than himself.
755,CHAPTER IV.,
756,CHAPTER IV.,"Elinor Clare was an excellent young lady--discreet, intelligent, and"
757,CHAPTER IV.,"affectionate. Allan revered her as a parent, while he loved her as"
758,CHAPTER IV.,his own familiar friend. He told all the little secrets of his heart
759,CHAPTER IV.,"to her--but there was _one_, which he had hitherto unaccountably"
760,CHAPTER IV.,"concealed from her--namely, the extent of his regard for Rosamund."
761,CHAPTER IV.,
762,CHAPTER IV.,"Elinor knew of his visits to the cottage, and was no stranger to the"
763,CHAPTER IV.,persons of Margaret and her granddaughter. She had several times met
764,CHAPTER IV.,"them, when she had been walking with her brother--a civility usually"
765,CHAPTER IV.,passed on either side--but Elinor avoided troubling her brother with
766,CHAPTER IV.,any unseasonable questions.
767,CHAPTER IV.,
768,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan's heart often beat, and he has been going to tell his sister"
769,CHAPTER IV.,"_all_--but something like shame (false or true, I shall not stay to"
770,CHAPTER IV.,"inquire) had hitherto kept him back;--still the secret, unrevealed,"
771,CHAPTER IV.,hung upon his conscience like a crime--for his temper had a sweet and
772,CHAPTER IV.,"noble frankness in it, which bespake him yet a virgin from the world."
773,CHAPTER IV.,
774,CHAPTER IV.,There was a fine openness in his countenance--the character of it
775,CHAPTER IV.,somewhat resembled Rosamund's--except that more fire and enthusiasm
776,CHAPTER IV.,were discernible in Allan's; his eyes were of a darker blue than
777,CHAPTER IV.,"Rosamund's--his hair was of a chestnut color--his cheeks ruddy, and"
778,CHAPTER IV.,"tinged with brown. There was a cordial sweetness in Allan's smile,"
779,CHAPTER IV.,the like to which I never saw in any other face.
780,CHAPTER IV.,
781,CHAPTER IV.,Elinor had hitherto connived at her brother's attachment to Rosamund.
782,CHAPTER IV.,"Elinor, I believe, was something of a physiognomist, and thought she"
783,CHAPTER IV.,"could trace in the countenance and manner of Rosamund, qualities"
784,CHAPTER IV.,which no brother of hers need be ashamed to love.
785,CHAPTER IV.,
786,CHAPTER IV.,The time was now come when Elinor was desirous of knowing her
787,CHAPTER IV.,brother's favorite more intimately--an opportunity offered of
788,CHAPTER IV.,breaking the matter to Allan.
789,CHAPTER IV.,
790,CHAPTER IV.,The morning of the day in which he carried his present of fruit and
791,CHAPTER IV.,"flowers to Rosamund, his sister had observed him more than usually"
792,CHAPTER IV.,"busy in the garden, culling fruit with a nicety of choice not common"
793,CHAPTER IV.,to him.
794,CHAPTER IV.,
795,CHAPTER IV.,"She came up to him, unobserved, and, taking him by the arm, inquired,"
796,CHAPTER IV.,"with a questioning smile--""What are you doing, Allan? and who are"
797,CHAPTER IV.,"those peaches designed for?"""
798,CHAPTER IV.,
799,CHAPTER IV.,"""For Rosamund Gray""--he replied--and his heart seemed relieved of a"

809,CHAPTER IV.,His sister promised to accompany him after dinner; and they parted.
810,CHAPTER IV.,"Allan gathered no more peaches, but hastily cropping a few roses to"
811,CHAPTER IV.,"fling into his basket, went away with it half-filled, being impatient"
812,CHAPTER IV.,to announce to Rosamund the coming of her promised visitor.

821,CHAPTER V.,"When Allan returned home, he found an invitation had been left for"
822,CHAPTER V.,"him, in his absence, to spend that evening with a young friend, who"
823,CHAPTER V.,"had just quitted a public school in London, and was come to pass one"
824,CHAPTER V.,"night in his father's house at Widford, previous to his departure the"
825,CHAPTER V.,next morning for Edinburgh University.
826,CHAPTER V.,
827,CHAPTER V.,It was Allan's bosom friend--they had not met for some months--and it
828,CHAPTER V.,was probable a much longer time must intervene before they should
829,CHAPTER V.,meet again.
830,CHAPTER V.,
831,CHAPTER V.,Yet Allan could not help looking a little blank when he first heard
832,CHAPTER V.,of the invitation. This was to have been an important evening. But
833,CHAPTER V.,Elinor soon relieved her brother by expressing her readiness to go
834,CHAPTER V.,alone to the cottage.
835,CHAPTER V.,
836,CHAPTER V.,"""I will not lose the pleasure I promised myself, whatever you may"
837,CHAPTER V.,"determine upon, Allan; I will go by myself rather than be"
838,CHAPTER V.,"disappointed."""
839,CHAPTER V.,
840,CHAPTER V.,"""Will you, will you, Elinor?"""
841,CHAPTER V.,
842,CHAPTER V.,"Elinor promised to go--and I believe, Allan, on a second thought, was"
843,CHAPTER V.,not very sorry to be spared the awkwardness of introducing two
844,CHAPTER V.,"persons to each other, both so dear to him, but either of whom might"
845,CHAPTER V.,happen not much to fancy the other.
846,CHAPTER V.,
847,CHAPTER V.,"At times, indeed, he was confident that Elinor _must_ love Rosamund,"
848,CHAPTER V.,and Rosamund _must_ love Elinor; but there were also times in which
849,CHAPTER V.,he felt misgivings--it was an event he could scarce hope for very
850,CHAPTER V.,joy!
851,CHAPTER V.,
852,CHAPTER V.,Allan's _real presence_ that evening was more at the cottage than at
853,CHAPTER V.,"the house, where his _bodily semblance_ was visiting--his friend"
854,CHAPTER V.,"could not help complaining of a certain absence of mind, a _coldness_"
855,CHAPTER V.,he called it.
856,CHAPTER V.,
857,CHAPTER V.,"It might have been expected, and in the course of things predicted,"
858,CHAPTER V.,that Allan would have asked his friend some questions of what had
859,CHAPTER V.,"happened since their last meeting, what his feelings were on leaving"
860,CHAPTER V.,"school, the probable time when they should meet again, and a, hundred"
861,CHAPTER V.,natural questions which friendship is most lavish of at such times;
862,CHAPTER V.,but nothing of all this ever occurred to Allan--they did not even
863,CHAPTER V.,settle the method of their future correspondence.
864,CHAPTER V.,
865,CHAPTER V.,"The consequence was, as might have been expected, Allan's friend"
866,CHAPTER V.,"thought him much altered, and, after his departure, sat down to"
867,CHAPTER V.,"compose a doleful sonnet about a ""faithless friend.""--I do not find"
868,CHAPTER V.,"that he ever finished it--indignation, or a dearth of rhymes, causing"
869,CHAPTER V.,him to break off in the middle.

878,CHAPTER VI.,"In my catalogue of the little library at the cottage, I forgot to"
879,CHAPTER VI.,mention a book of Common Prayer. My reader's fancy might easily have
880,CHAPTER VI.,supplied the omission--old ladies of Margaret's stamp (God bless
881,CHAPTER VI.,"them!) may as well be without their spectacles, or their elbow-chair,"
882,CHAPTER VI.,as their prayer-book--I love them for it.
883,CHAPTER VI.,
884,CHAPTER VI.,"Margaret's was a handsome octavo, printed by Baskerville, the binding"
885,CHAPTER VI.,"red, and fortified with silver at the edges. Out of this book it was"
886,CHAPTER VI.,their custom every afternoon to read the proper psalms appointed for
887,CHAPTER VI.,the day.
888,CHAPTER VI.,
889,CHAPTER VI.,The way they managed was this: they took verse by verse--Rosamund
890,CHAPTER VI.,"_read_ her little portion, and Margaret repeated hers in turn, from"
891,CHAPTER VI.,"memory--for Margaret could say all the Psalter by heart, and a good"
892,CHAPTER VI.,part of the Bible besides. She would not unfrequently put the girl
893,CHAPTER VI.,right when she stumbled or skipped. This Margaret imputed to
894,CHAPTER VI.,giddiness--a quality which Rosamund was by no means remarkable
895,CHAPTER VI.,"for--but old ladies, like Margaret, are not in all instances alike"
896,CHAPTER VI.,discriminative.
897,CHAPTER VI.,
898,CHAPTER VI.,They had been employed in this manner just before Miss Clare arrived
899,CHAPTER VI.,at the cottage. The psalm they had been reading was the hundred and
900,CHAPTER VI.,fourth--Margaret was naturally led by it into a discussion of the
901,CHAPTER VI.,works of creation.
902,CHAPTER VI.,
903,CHAPTER VI.,There had been _thunder_ in the course of the day--an occasion of
904,CHAPTER VI.,instruction which the old lady never let pass--she began--
905,CHAPTER VI.,
906,CHAPTER VI.,"""Thunder has a very awful sound--some say God Almighty is angry"
907,CHAPTER VI.,whenever it thunders--that it is the voice of God speaking to us; for
908,CHAPTER VI.,"my part, I am not afraid of it""----"
909,CHAPTER VI.,
910,CHAPTER VI.,"And in this manner the old lady was going on to particularize, as"
911,CHAPTER VI.,"usual, its beneficial effects, in clearing the air, destroying of"
912,CHAPTER VI.,"vermin, &c., when the entrance of Miss Clare put an end to her"
913,CHAPTER VI.,discourse.
914,CHAPTER VI.,
915,CHAPTER VI.,"Rosamund received her with respectful tenderness--and, taking her"
916,CHAPTER VI.,"grandmother by the hand, said, with great sweetness,--""Miss Clare is"
917,CHAPTER VI.,"come to see you, grandmother."""
918,CHAPTER VI.,
919,CHAPTER VI.,"""I beg pardon, lady--I cannot _see_ you--but you are heartily"
920,CHAPTER VI.,"welcome. Is your brother with you, Miss Clare?--I don't hear him."""
921,CHAPTER VI.,
922,CHAPTER VI.,"""He could not come, madam, but he sends his love by me."""
923,CHAPTER VI.,
924,CHAPTER VI.,"""You have an excellent brother, Miss Clare--but pray do us the honor"
925,CHAPTER VI.,"to take some refreshment--Rosamund""----"
926,CHAPTER VI.,
927,CHAPTER VI.,And the old lady was going to give directions for a bottle of her
928,CHAPTER VI.,"currant wine--when Elinor, smiling, said ""she was come to take a cup"
929,CHAPTER VI.,"of tea with her, and expected to find no ceremony."""
930,CHAPTER VI.,
931,CHAPTER VI.,"""After tea, I promise myself a walk with you, Rosamund, if your"
932,CHAPTER VI.,"grandmother can spare you."" Rosamund looked at her grandmother."
933,CHAPTER VI.,
934,CHAPTER VI.,"""Oh, for that matter, I should be sorry to debar the girl from any"
935,CHAPTER VI.,pleasure--I am sure it's lonesome enough for her to be with _me_
936,CHAPTER VI.,"always--and if Miss Clare will take you out, child, I shall do very"
937,CHAPTER VI.,"well by myself till you return--it will not be the first time, you"
938,CHAPTER VI.,"know, that I have been left here alone--some of the neighbors will be"
939,CHAPTER VI.,"dropping in bye and bye--or, if _not_, I shall take no harm."""
940,CHAPTER VI.,
941,CHAPTER VI.,Rosamund had all the simple manners of a child; she kissed her
942,CHAPTER VI.,"grandmother, and looked happy."
943,CHAPTER VI.,
944,CHAPTER VI.,All tea-time the old lady's discourse was little more than a
945,CHAPTER VI.,panegyric on young Clare's good qualities. Elinor looked at her young
946,CHAPTER VI.,"friend, and smiled. Rosamund was beginning to look grave--but there"
947,CHAPTER VI.,"was a cordial sunshine in the face of Elinor, before which any clouds"
948,CHAPTER VI.,of reserve that had been gathering on Rosamund's soon brake away.
949,CHAPTER VI.,
950,CHAPTER VI.,"""Does your grandmother ever go out, Rosamund?"""
951,CHAPTER VI.,
952,CHAPTER VI.,"Margaret prevented the girl's reply, by saying--""My dear young lady,"
953,CHAPTER VI.,"I am an old woman, and very infirm--Rosamund takes me a few paces"
954,CHAPTER VI.,beyond the door sometimes--but I walk very badly--I love best to sit
955,CHAPTER VI.,in our little arbor when the sun shines--I can yet feel it warm and
956,CHAPTER VI.,"cheerful--and, if I lose the beauties of the season, I shall be very"
957,CHAPTER VI.,happy if you and Rosamund can take delight in this fine summer
958,CHAPTER VI.,"evening."""
959,CHAPTER VI.,
960,CHAPTER VI.,"""I shall want to rob you of Rosamund's company now and then, if we"
961,CHAPTER VI.,"like one another. I had hoped to have seen _you_, madam, at our"
962,CHAPTER VI.,house. I don't know whether we could not make room for you to come
963,CHAPTER VI.,and live with us--what say you to it? Allan would be proud to tend
964,CHAPTER VI.,"you, I am sure; and Rosamund and I should be nice company."""
965,CHAPTER VI.,
966,CHAPTER VI.,"Margaret was all unused to such kindnesses, and wept--Margaret had a"
967,CHAPTER VI.,great spirit--yet she was not above accepting an obligation from a
968,CHAPTER VI.,worthy person--there was a delicacy in Miss Clare's manner--she could
969,CHAPTER VI.,"have no interest but pure goodness, to induce her to make the"
970,CHAPTER VI.,offer--at length the old lady spake from a full heart.
971,CHAPTER VI.,
972,CHAPTER VI.,"""Miss Clare, this little cottage received us in our distress--it gave"
973,CHAPTER VI.,"us shelter when we had _no home_--we have praised God in it--and,"
974,CHAPTER VI.,"while life remains, I think I shall never part from it--Rosamund does"
975,CHAPTER VI.,"everything for me""--"
976,CHAPTER VI.,
977,CHAPTER VI.,"""And will do, grandmother, as long as I live;""--and then Rosamund"
978,CHAPTER VI.,fell a-crying.
979,CHAPTER VI.,
980,CHAPTER VI.,"""You are a good girl, Rosamund; and if you do but find friends when I"
981,CHAPTER VI.,"am dead and gone, I shall want no better accommodation while I"
982,CHAPTER VI.,"live--but God bless you, lady, a thousand times, for your kind"
983,CHAPTER VI.,"offer."""
984,CHAPTER VI.,
985,CHAPTER VI.,"Elinor was moved to tears, and, affecting a sprightliness, bade"
986,CHAPTER VI.,Rosamund prepare for her walk. The girl put on her white silk bonnet;
987,CHAPTER VI.,and Elinor thought she never beheld so lovely a creature.
988,CHAPTER VI.,
989,CHAPTER VI.,"They took leave of Margaret, and walked out together; they rambled"
990,CHAPTER VI.,over all Rosamund's favorite haunts--through many a sunny field--by
991,CHAPTER VI.,"secret glade or wood-walk, where the girl had wandered so often with"
992,CHAPTER VI.,her beloved Clare.
993,CHAPTER VI.,
994,CHAPTER VI.,Who now so happy as Rosamund? She had oft-times heard Allan speak
995,CHAPTER VI.,"with great tenderness of his sister--she was now rambling, arm in"
996,CHAPTER VI.,"arm, with that very sister, the ""vaunted sister"" of her friend, her"
997,CHAPTER VI.,beloved Clare.
998,CHAPTER VI.,
999,CHAPTER VI.,"Not a tree, not a bush, scarce a wild flower in their path, but"
1000,CHAPTER VI.,"revived in Rosamund some tender recollection, a conversation perhaps,"
1001,CHAPTER VI.,"or some chaste endearment. Life, and a new scene of things, were now"
1002,CHAPTER VI.,opening before her--she was got into a fairy land of uncertain
1003,CHAPTER VI.,existence.
1004,CHAPTER VI.,
1005,CHAPTER VI.,Rosamund was too happy to talk much--but Elinor was delighted with
1006,CHAPTER VI.,her when she _did_ talk:--the girl's remarks were suggested most of
1007,CHAPTER VI.,"them by the passing scene--and they betrayed, all of them, the"
1008,CHAPTER VI.,liveliness of present impulse;--her conversation did not consist in a
1009,CHAPTER VI.,"comparison of vapid feeling, an interchange of sentiment lip-deep--it"
1010,CHAPTER VI.,had all the freshness of young sensation in it.
1011,CHAPTER VI.,
1012,CHAPTER VI.,Sometimes they talked of Allan.
1013,CHAPTER VI.,
1014,CHAPTER VI.,"""Allan is very good,"" said Rosamund, ""very good _indeed_ to my"
1015,CHAPTER VI.,"grandmother--he will sit with her, and hear her stories, and read to"
1016,CHAPTER VI.,"her, and try to divert her a hundred ways. I wonder sometimes he is"
1017,CHAPTER VI.,"not tired. She talks him to death!"""
1018,CHAPTER VI.,
1019,CHAPTER VI.,"""Then you confess, Rosamund, that the old lady _does_ tire _you_"
1020,CHAPTER VI.,"sometimes?"""
1021,CHAPTER VI.,
1022,CHAPTER VI.,"""Oh no, I did not mean _that_--it's very different--I am used to all"
1023,CHAPTER VI.,"her ways, and I can humor her, and please her, and I ought to do it,"
1024,CHAPTER VI.,"for she is the only friend I ever had in the world."""
1025,CHAPTER VI.,
1026,CHAPTER VI.,"The new friends did not conclude their walk till it was late, and"
1027,CHAPTER VI.,"Rosamund began to be apprehensive about the old lady, who had been"
1028,CHAPTER VI.,all this time alone.
1029,CHAPTER VI.,
1030,CHAPTER VI.,"On their return to the cottage, they found that Margaret had been"
1031,CHAPTER VI.,"somewhat impatient--old ladies, _good old ladies_, will be so at"
1032,CHAPTER VI.,"times--age is timorous and suspicious of danger, where no danger is."
1033,CHAPTER VI.,
1034,CHAPTER VI.,"Besides, it was Margaret's bedtime, for she kept very good"
1035,CHAPTER VI.,"hours--indeed, in the distribution of her meals, and sundry other"
1036,CHAPTER VI.,"particulars, she resembled the livers in the antique world, more than"
1037,CHAPTER VI.,might well beseem a creature of this.
1038,CHAPTER VI.,
1039,CHAPTER VI.,So the new friends parted for that night. Elinor having made Margaret
1040,CHAPTER VI.,promise to give Rosamund leave to come and see her the next day.

1052,CHAPTER VII.,
1053,CHAPTER VII.,"Allan, I believe, got little sleep that night. I know not, whether"

1055,CHAPTER VII.,"very wakeful, I know."
1056,CHAPTER VII.,
1057,CHAPTER VII.,Elinor Clare was the best good creature--the least selfish human
1058,CHAPTER VII.,"being I ever knew--always at work for other people's good, planning"
1059,CHAPTER VII.,other people's happiness--continually forgetful to consult for her
1060,CHAPTER VII.,"own personal gratifications, except indirectly, in the welfare of"
1061,CHAPTER VII.,"another; while her parents lived, the most attentive of"

1067,CHAPTER VII.,"point of being married to Mr. Beaumont, of Staffordshire, and had"

1083,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,"I fear more for Allan than myself. The loss of two such parents,"
1084,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,"within so short an interval, bears very heavy on him. The boy _hangs_"

1132,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,undeceive people--with the better sort their kind labors prevailed;
1133,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,but there was still a party who shut their ears. You know the issue
1134,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,of it. My father's great spirit bore up against it for some time--my
1135,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,father never was a _bad_ man--but that spirit was broken at the
1136,ELINOR CLARE TO MARIA LESLIE.,last--and the greatly-injured man was forced to leave his old

1345,CHAPTER VIII.,CHAPTER VIII.
1346,CHAPTER VIII.,
1347,CHAPTER VIII.,
1348,CHAPTER VIII.,They had but four rooms in the cottage. Margaret slept in the biggest
1349,CHAPTER VIII.,"room up-stairs, and her grand-daughter in a kind of closet adjoining,"
1350,CHAPTER VIII.,"where she could be within hearing, if her grandmother should call her"
1351,CHAPTER VIII.,in the night.
1352,CHAPTER VIII.,
1353,CHAPTER VIII.,The girl was often disturbed in that manner--two or three times in a
1354,CHAPTER VIII.,"night she has been forced to leave her bed, to fetch her"
1355,CHAPTER VIII.,"grandmother's cordials, or do some little service for her--but she"
1356,CHAPTER VIII.,"knew that Margaret's ailings were _real_ and pressing, and Rosamund"
1357,CHAPTER VIII.,"never complained--never suspected, that her grandmother's"
1358,CHAPTER VIII.,requisitions had anything unreasonable in them.
1359,CHAPTER VIII.,
1360,CHAPTER VIII.,"The night she parted with Miss Clare, she had helped Margaret to bed,"
1361,CHAPTER VIII.,"as usual--and, after saying her prayers, as the custom was, kneeling"
1362,CHAPTER VIII.,"by the old lady's bedside, kissed her grandmother, and wished her a"
1363,CHAPTER VIII.,"good-night--Margaret blessed her, and charged her to go to bed"
1364,CHAPTER VIII.,"directly. It was her customary injunction, and Rosamund had never"
1365,CHAPTER VIII.,dreamed of disobeying.
1366,CHAPTER VIII.,
1367,CHAPTER VIII.,So she retired to her little room. The night was warm and clear--the
1368,CHAPTER VIII.,moon very bright--her window commanded a view of _scenes_ she had
1369,CHAPTER VIII.,been tracing in the daytime with Miss Clare.
1370,CHAPTER VIII.,
1371,CHAPTER VIII.,"All the events of the day past, the occurrences of their walk arose"
1372,CHAPTER VIII.,in her mind. She fancied she should like to retrace those scenes--but
1373,CHAPTER VIII.,"it was now nine o'clock, a late hour in the village."
1374,CHAPTER VIII.,
1375,CHAPTER VIII.,Still she fancied it would be very charming--and then her
1376,CHAPTER VIII.,grandmother's injunction came powerfully to her recollection--she
1377,CHAPTER VIII.,"sighed, and turned from the window-and walked up and down her little"
1378,CHAPTER VIII.,room.
1379,CHAPTER VIII.,
1380,CHAPTER VIII.,"Ever, when she looked at the window, the wish returned. It was not so"
1381,CHAPTER VIII.,"_very late_. The neighbors were yet about, passing under the window"
1382,CHAPTER VIII.,"to their homes--she thought, and thought again, till her sensations"
1383,CHAPTER VIII.,"became vivid, even to painfulness--her bosom was aching to give them"
1384,CHAPTER VIII.,vent.
1385,CHAPTER VIII.,
1386,CHAPTER VIII.,The village-clock struck ten!--the neighbors ceased to pass under the
1387,CHAPTER VIII.,"window. Rosamund, stealing downstairs, fastened the latch behind her,"
1388,CHAPTER VIII.,and left the cottage.
1389,CHAPTER VIII.,
1390,CHAPTER VIII.,"One, that knew her, met her, and observed her with some surprise."
1391,CHAPTER VIII.,Another recollects having wished her a good-night. Rosamund never
1392,CHAPTER VIII.,returned to the cottage.
1393,CHAPTER VIII.,
1394,CHAPTER VIII.,"An old man, that lay sick in a small house adjoining to Margaret's,"
1395,CHAPTER VIII.,"testified the next morning, that he had plainly heard the old"
1396,CHAPTER VIII.,creature calling for her granddaughter. All the night long she made
1397,CHAPTER VIII.,"her moan, and ceased not to call upon the name of Rosamund. But no"
1398,CHAPTER VIII.,"Rosamund was there--the voice died away, but not till near daybreak."
1399,CHAPTER VIII.,
1400,CHAPTER VIII.,"When the neighbors came to search in the morning, Margaret was"
1401,CHAPTER VIII.,"missing! She had _straggled_ out of bed, and made her way into"
1402,CHAPTER VIII.,"Rosamund's room--worn out with fatigue and fright, when she found the"
1403,CHAPTER VIII.,"girl not there, she had laid herself down to die--and, it is thought,"
1404,CHAPTER VIII.,"she died _praying_--for she was discovered in a kneeling posture, her"

1418,CHAPTER IX.,nature.
1419,CHAPTER IX.,
1420,CHAPTER IX.,"Rosamund, enthusiastic and improvident, wandered unprotected to a"
1421,CHAPTER IX.,"distance from her guardian doors--through lonely glens, and"
1422,CHAPTER IX.,"wood-walks, where she had rambled many a _day_ in safety--till she"

1424,CHAPTER IX.,
1425,CHAPTER IX.,"_Matravis_ met her.---""Flown with insolence and wine,"" returning home"

1427,CHAPTER IX.,
1428,CHAPTER IX.,Matravis was a very ugly man. Sallow-complexioned! and if hearts can
1429,CHAPTER IX.,"wear that color, his heart was sallow-complexioned also."
1430,CHAPTER IX.,
1431,CHAPTER IX.,A young man with _gray_ deliberation! cold and systematic in all his
1432,CHAPTER IX.,plans; and all his plans were evil. His very lust was systematic.
1433,CHAPTER IX.,
1434,CHAPTER IX.,He would brood over his bad purposes for such a dreary length of time
1435,CHAPTER IX.,"that, it might have been expected, some solitary check of conscience"
1436,CHAPTER IX.,must have intervened to save him from commission. But that _Light
1437,CHAPTER IX.,from Heaven_ was extinct in his dark bosom.
1438,CHAPTER IX.,
1439,CHAPTER IX.,"Nothing that is great, nothing that is amiable, existed for this"
1440,CHAPTER IX.,"unhappy man. He feared, he envied, he suspected; but he never loved."
1441,CHAPTER IX.,"The sublime and beautiful in nature, the excellent and becoming in"
1442,CHAPTER IX.,"morals, were things placed beyond the capacity of his sensations. He"
1443,CHAPTER IX.,loved not poetry--nor ever took a lonely walk to meditate--never
1444,CHAPTER IX.,"beheld virtue, which he did not try to disbelieve, or female beauty"
1445,CHAPTER IX.,"and innocence, which he did not lust to contaminate."
1446,CHAPTER IX.,
1447,CHAPTER IX.,"A sneer was perpetually upon his face, and malice _grinning_ at his"
1448,CHAPTER IX.,"heart. He would say the most ill-natured things, with the least"
1449,CHAPTER IX.,"remorse, of any man I ever knew. This gained him the reputation of a"
1450,CHAPTER IX.,wit--other _traits_ got him the reputation of a villain.
1451,CHAPTER IX.,
1452,CHAPTER IX.,And this man formerly paid his court to Elinor Clare!--with what
1453,CHAPTER IX.,success I leave my readers to determine. It was not in Elinor's
1454,CHAPTER IX.,nature to despise any living thing--but in the estimation of this
1455,CHAPTER IX.,"man, to be rejected was to be _despised_--and Matravis _never"
1456,CHAPTER IX.,forgave_.
1457,CHAPTER IX.,
1458,CHAPTER IX.,He had long turned his eyes upon Rosamund Gray. To steal from the
1459,CHAPTER IX.,"bosom of her friends the jewel they prized so much, the little ewe"
1460,CHAPTER IX.,"lamb they held so dear, was a scheme of delicate revenge, and"
1461,CHAPTER IX.,Matravis had a twofold motive for accomplishing this young maid's
1462,CHAPTER IX.,ruin.
1463,CHAPTER IX.,
1464,CHAPTER IX.,"Often had he met her in her favorite solitudes, but found her ever"
1465,CHAPTER IX.,cold and inaccessible. Of late the girl had avoided straying far from
1466,CHAPTER IX.,"her own home, in the fear of meeting him--but she had never told her"
1467,CHAPTER IX.,fears to Allan.
1468,CHAPTER IX.,
1469,CHAPTER IX.,"Matravis had, till now, been content to be a villain within the"
1470,CHAPTER IX.,"limits of the law--but, on the present occasion, hot fumes of wine,"
1471,CHAPTER IX.,"cooperating with his deep desire of revenge, and the insolence of an"
1472,CHAPTER IX.,"unhoped-for meeting, overcame his customary prudence, and Matravis"
1473,CHAPTER IX.,"rose, at once, to an audacity of glorious mischief."
1474,CHAPTER IX.,
1475,CHAPTER IX.,"Late at night he met her, a lonely, unprotected virgin--no friend at"
1476,CHAPTER IX.,hand--no place near of refuge.
1477,CHAPTER IX.,
1478,CHAPTER IX.,"Rosamund Gray, my soul is exceeding sorrowful for thee--I loathe to"
1479,CHAPTER IX.,tell the hateful circumstances of thy wrongs. Night and silence were
1480,CHAPTER IX.,the only witnesses of this young maid's disgrace--Matravis fled.
1481,CHAPTER IX.,
1482,CHAPTER IX.,"Rosamund, polluted and disgraced, wandered, an abandoned thing, about"
1483,CHAPTER IX.,the fields and meadows till daybreak. Not caring to return to the
1484,CHAPTER IX.,"cottage, she sat herself down before the gate of Miss Clare's"
1485,CHAPTER IX.,house--in a stupor of grief.
1486,CHAPTER IX.,
1487,CHAPTER IX.,"Elinor was just rising, and had opened the windows of her chamber,"
1488,CHAPTER IX.,when she perceived her desolate young friend. She ran to embrace
1489,CHAPTER IX.,her--she brought her into the house--she took her to her bosom--she
1490,CHAPTER IX.,kissed her--she spake to her; but Rosamund could not speak.
1491,CHAPTER IX.,
1492,CHAPTER IX.,Tidings came from the cottage. Margaret's death was an event which
1493,CHAPTER IX.,could not be kept concealed from Rosamund. When the sweet maid heard
1494,CHAPTER IX.,"of it, she languished, and fell sick--she never held up her head"
1495,CHAPTER IX.,after that time.
1496,CHAPTER IX.,
1497,CHAPTER IX.,"If Rosamund had been a _sister_, she could not have been kindlier"
1498,CHAPTER IX.,treated than by her two friends.
1499,CHAPTER IX.,
1500,CHAPTER IX.,"Allan had prospects in life--might, in time, have married into any of"
1501,CHAPTER IX.,"the first families in Hertfordshire--but Rosamund Gray, humbled"
1502,CHAPTER IX.,"though she was, and put to shame, had yet a charm for _him_--and he"
1503,CHAPTER IX.,"would have been content to share his fortunes with her yet, if"
1504,CHAPTER IX.,Rosamund would have lived to be his companion.
1505,CHAPTER IX.,
1506,CHAPTER IX.,But this was not to be--and the girl soon after died. She expired in
1507,CHAPTER IX.,"the arms of Elinor--quiet, gentle, as she lived--thankful that she"
1508,CHAPTER IX.,"died not among strangers--and expressing, by signs rather than words,"
1509,CHAPTER IX.,"a gratitude for the most trifling services, the common offices of"
1510,CHAPTER IX.,"humanity. She died uncomplaining; and this young maid, this untaught"
1511,CHAPTER IX.,"Rosamund, might have given a lesson to the grave philosopher in"
1512,CHAPTER IX.,death.

1522,CHAPTER X.,"remember the story, and tell of Rosamund Gray, and old blind"
1523,CHAPTER X.,Margaret.
1524,CHAPTER X.,
1525,CHAPTER X.,"I parted from Allan Clare on that disastrous night, and set out for"
1526,CHAPTER X.,"Edinburgh the next morning, before the facts were commonly known--I"
1527,CHAPTER X.,heard not of them--and it was four months before I received a letter
1528,CHAPTER X.,from Allan.
1529,CHAPTER X.,
1530,CHAPTER X.,"""His heart,"" he told me, ""was gone from him--for his sister had died"
1531,CHAPTER X.,"of a frenzy fever!""--not a word of Rosamund in the letter--I was left"
1532,CHAPTER X.,to collect her story from sources which may one day be explained.
1533,CHAPTER X.,
1534,CHAPTER X.,"I soon after quitted Scotland, on the death of my father, and"
1535,CHAPTER X.,"returned to my native village. Allan had left the place, and I could"
1536,CHAPTER X.,"gain no information, whether he were dead or living."
1537,CHAPTER X.,
1538,CHAPTER X.,"I passed the _cottage_. I did not dare to look that way, or to"
1539,CHAPTER X.,"inquire _who_ lived there. A little dog, that had been Rosamund's,"
1540,CHAPTER X.,"was yelping in my path. I laughed aloud like one mad, whose mind had"
1541,CHAPTER X.,"suddenly gone from him--I stared vacantly around me, like one"
1542,CHAPTER X.,alienated from common perceptions.
1543,CHAPTER X.,
1544,CHAPTER X.,"But I was young at that time, and the impression became gradually"
1545,CHAPTER X.,weakened as I mingled in the business of life. It is now _ten years_
1546,CHAPTER X.,"since these events took place, and I sometimes think of them as"
1547,CHAPTER X.,unreal. Allan Clare was a dear friend to me--but there are times when
1548,CHAPTER X.,"Allan and his sister, Margaret and her grand-daughter, appear like"
1549,CHAPTER X.,personages of a dream--an idle dream.

1556,CHAPTER XI.,
1557,CHAPTER XI.,
1558,CHAPTER XI.,Strange things have happened unto me--I seem scarce awake--but I will
1559,CHAPTER XI.,"recollect my thoughts, and try to give an account of what has"
1560,CHAPTER XI.,befallen me in the few last weeks.
1561,CHAPTER XI.,
1562,CHAPTER XI.,Since my father's death our family have resided in London. I am in
1563,CHAPTER XI.,practice as a surgeon there. My mother died two years after we left
1564,CHAPTER XI.,Widford.
1565,CHAPTER XI.,
1566,CHAPTER XI.,"A month or two ago, I had been busying myself in drawing up the above"
1567,CHAPTER XI.,"narrative, intending to make it public. The employment had forced my"
1568,CHAPTER XI.,"mind to dwell upon _facts_, which had begun to fade from it--the"
1569,CHAPTER XI.,"memory of old times became vivid, and more vivid--I felt a strong"
1570,CHAPTER XI.,desire to revisit the scenes of my native village--of the young loves
1571,CHAPTER XI.,of Rosamund and her Clare.
1572,CHAPTER XI.,
1573,CHAPTER XI.,"A kind of dread had hitherto kept me back; but I was restless now,"
1574,CHAPTER XI.,till I had accomplished my wish. I set out one morning to walk--I
1575,CHAPTER XI.,reached Widford about eleven in the forenoon--after a slight
1576,CHAPTER XI.,breakfast at my inn--where I was mortified to perceive the old
1577,CHAPTER XI.,landlord did not know me again--(old Thomas Billet--he has often made
1578,CHAPTER XI.,angle-rods for me when a child)--I rambled over all my accustomed
1579,CHAPTER XI.,haunts.
1580,CHAPTER XI.,
1581,CHAPTER XI.,"Our old house was vacant, and to be sold. I entered, unmolested, into"
1582,CHAPTER XI.,the room that had been my bedchamber. I kneeled down on the spot
1583,CHAPTER XI.,where my little bed had stood--I felt like a child--I prayed like
1584,CHAPTER XI.,one--it seemed as though old times were to return again--I looked
1585,CHAPTER XI.,"round involuntarily, expecting to see some face I knew--but all was"
1586,CHAPTER XI.,"naked and mute. The bed was gone. My little pane of painted window,"
1587,CHAPTER XI.,through which I loved to look at the sun when I awoke in a fine
1588,CHAPTER XI.,"summer's morning, was taken out, and had been replaced by one of"
1589,CHAPTER XI.,common glass.
1590,CHAPTER XI.,
1591,CHAPTER XI.,"I visited, by turns, every chamber--they were all desolate and"
1592,CHAPTER XI.,"unfurnished, one excepted, in which the owner had left a harpsichord,"
1593,CHAPTER XI.,probably to be sold--I touched the keys--I played some old Scottish
1594,CHAPTER XI.,"tunes, which had delighted me when a child. Past associations revived"
1595,CHAPTER XI.,"with the music--blended with a sense of _unreality_, which at last"
1596,CHAPTER XI.,became too powerful--I rushed out of the room to give vent to my
1597,CHAPTER XI.,feelings.
1598,CHAPTER XI.,
1599,CHAPTER XI.,"I wandered, scarce knowing where, into an old wood, that stands at"
1600,CHAPTER XI.,the back of the house--we called it the _Wilderness_. A well-known
1601,CHAPTER XI.,"_form_ was missing, that used to meet me in this place--it was"
1602,CHAPTER XI.,"thine--Ben Moxam--the kindest, gentlest, politest of human beings,"
1603,CHAPTER XI.,yet was he nothing higher than a gardener in the family. Honest
1604,CHAPTER XI.,"creature! thou didst never pass me in my childish rambles, without a"
1605,CHAPTER XI.,"soft speech, and a smile. I remember thy good-natured face. But there"
1606,CHAPTER XI.,"is one thing, for which I can never forgive thee, Ben Moxam--that"
1607,CHAPTER XI.,"thou didst join with an old maiden aunt of mine in a cruel plot, to"
1608,CHAPTER XI.,lop away the hanging branches of the old fir-trees--I remember them
1609,CHAPTER XI.,sweeping to the ground.
1610,CHAPTER XI.,
1611,CHAPTER XI.,I have often left my childish sports to ramble in this place--its
1612,CHAPTER XI.,"glooms and its solitude had a mysterious charm for my young mind,"
1613,CHAPTER XI.,"nurturing within me that love of quietness and lonely thinking, which"
1614,CHAPTER XI.,has accompanied me to maturer years.
1615,CHAPTER XI.,
1616,CHAPTER XI.,"In this _Wilderness_ I found myself, after a ten years' absence. Its"
1617,CHAPTER XI.,"stately fir-trees were yet standing, with all their luxuriant company"
1618,CHAPTER XI.,"of underwood--the squirrel was there, and the melancholy cooings of"
1619,CHAPTER XI.,the wood-pigeon--all was as I had left it--my heart softened at the
1620,CHAPTER XI.,sight--it seemed as though my character had been suffering a _change_
1621,CHAPTER XI.,since I forsook these shades.
1622,CHAPTER XI.,
1623,CHAPTER XI.,"My parents were both dead--I had no counsellor left, no experience of"
1624,CHAPTER XI.,"age to direct me, no sweet voice of reproof. The Lord had taken away"
1625,CHAPTER XI.,"my _friends_, and I knew not where he had laid them. I paced round"
1626,CHAPTER XI.,"the wilderness, seeking a comforter. I prayed that I might be"
1627,CHAPTER XI.,"restored to that _state of innocence_, in which I had wandered in"
1628,CHAPTER XI.,those shades.
1629,CHAPTER XI.,
1630,CHAPTER XI.,"Methought my request was heard, for it seemed as though the stains of"
1631,CHAPTER XI.,"manhood were passing from me, and I were relapsing into the purity"
1632,CHAPTER XI.,and simplicity of childhood. I was content to have been moulded into
1633,CHAPTER XI.,"a perfect child. I stood still, as in a trance. I dreamed that I was"
1634,CHAPTER XI.,"enjoying a personal intercourse with my heavenly Father--and,"
1635,CHAPTER XI.,"extravagantly, put off the shoes from my feet--for the place where I"
1636,CHAPTER XI.,"stood I thought, was holy ground."
1637,CHAPTER XI.,
1638,CHAPTER XI.,"This state of mind could not last long, and I returned with languid"
1639,CHAPTER XI.,feelings to my inn. I ordered my dinner--green peas and a
1640,CHAPTER XI.,sweetbread--it had been a favorite dish with me in my childhood--I
1641,CHAPTER XI.,was allowed to have it on my birthdays. I was impatient to see it
1642,CHAPTER XI.,"come upon table--but, when it came, I could scarce eat a mouthful--my"
1643,CHAPTER XI.,tears choked me. I called for wine--I drank a pint and a half of red
1644,CHAPTER XI.,"wine--and not till then had I dared to visit the church-yard, where"
1645,CHAPTER XI.,my parents were interred.
1646,CHAPTER XI.,
1647,CHAPTER XI.,The _cottage_ lay in my way--Margaret had chosen it for that very
1648,CHAPTER XI.,"reason, to be near the church--for the old lady was regular in her"
1649,CHAPTER XI.,attendance on public worship--I passed on--and in a moment found
1650,CHAPTER XI.,myself among the tombs.
1651,CHAPTER XI.,
1652,CHAPTER XI.,"I had been present at my father's burial, and knew the spot again--my"
1653,CHAPTER XI.,mother's funeral I was prevented by illness from attending--a plain
1654,CHAPTER XI.,"stone was placed over the grave, with their initials carved upon"
1655,CHAPTER XI.,it--for they both occupied one grave.
1656,CHAPTER XI.,
1657,CHAPTER XI.,I prostrated myself before the spot--I kissed the earth that covered
1658,CHAPTER XI.,"them--I contemplated, with gloomy delight, the time when I should"
1659,CHAPTER XI.,"mingle my dust with theirs--and kneeled, with my arms incumbent on"
1660,CHAPTER XI.,"the gravestone, in a kind of mental prayer--for I could not speak."
1661,CHAPTER XI.,
1662,CHAPTER XI.,"Having performed these duties, I arose with quieter feelings, and"
1663,CHAPTER XI.,felt leisure to attend to indifferent objects.--Still I continued in
1664,CHAPTER XI.,"the church-yard, reading the various inscriptions, and moralizing on"
1665,CHAPTER XI.,"them with that kind of levity, which will not unfrequently spring up"
1666,CHAPTER XI.,"in the mind, in the midst of deep melancholy."
1667,CHAPTER XI.,
1668,CHAPTER XI.,"I read of nothing but careful parents, loving husbands, and dutiful"
1669,CHAPTER XI.,"children. I said jestingly, where be all the _bad_ people buried? Bad"
1670,CHAPTER XI.,"parents, bad husbands, bad children--what cemeteries are appointed"
1671,CHAPTER XI.,for these?--do they not sleep in consecrated ground? or is it but a
1672,CHAPTER XI.,"pious fiction, a generous oversight, in the survivors, which thus"
1673,CHAPTER XI.,"tricks out men's epitaphs when dead, who, in their lifetime,"
1674,CHAPTER XI.,"discharged the offices of life, perhaps, but lamely? Their failings,"
1675,CHAPTER XI.,"with their reproaches, now sleep with them in the grave. _Man wars"
1676,CHAPTER XI.,"not with the dead._ It is a _trait_ of human nature, for which I love"
1677,CHAPTER XI.,it.
1678,CHAPTER XI.,
1679,CHAPTER XI.,"I had not observed, till now, a little group assembled at the other"
1680,CHAPTER XI.,"end of the church-yard; it was a company of children, who were"
1681,CHAPTER XI.,"gathered round a young man, dressed in black, sitting on a"
1682,CHAPTER XI.,gravestone.
1683,CHAPTER XI.,
1684,CHAPTER XI.,"He seemed to be asking them questions--probably, about their"
1685,CHAPTER XI.,learning--and one little dirty ragged-headed fellow was clambering up
1686,CHAPTER XI.,his knees to kiss him. The children had been eating black
1687,CHAPTER XI.,"cherries--for some of the stones were scattered about, and their"
1688,CHAPTER XI.,mouths were smeared with them.
1689,CHAPTER XI.,
1690,CHAPTER XI.,"As I drew near them, I thought I discerned in the stranger a mild"
1691,CHAPTER XI.,"benignity of countenance, which I had somewhere seen before--I gazed"
1692,CHAPTER XI.,at him more attentively.
1693,CHAPTER XI.,
1694,CHAPTER XI.,It was Allan Clare! sitting on the grave of his sister.
1695,CHAPTER XI.,
1696,CHAPTER XI.,"I threw my arms about his neck. I exclaimed ""Allan""--he turned his"
1697,CHAPTER XI.,eyes upon me--he knew me--we both wept aloud--it seemed as though the
1698,CHAPTER XI.,"interval since we parted had been as nothing--I cried out, ""Come, and"
1699,CHAPTER XI.,"tell me about these things."""
1700,CHAPTER XI.,
1701,CHAPTER XI.,I drew him away from his little friends--he parted with a show of
1702,CHAPTER XI.,reluctance from the church-yard--Margaret and her grand-daughter lay
1703,CHAPTER XI.,"buried there, as well as his sister--I took him to my inn--secured a"
1704,CHAPTER XI.,"room, where we might be private--ordered fresh wine--scarce knowing"
1705,CHAPTER XI.,"what I did, I danced for joy."
1706,CHAPTER XI.,
1707,CHAPTER XI.,"Allan was quite overcome, and taking me by the hand, he said, ""This"
1708,CHAPTER XI.,"repays me for all."""
1709,CHAPTER XI.,
1710,CHAPTER XI.,It was a proud day for me--I had found the friend I thought
1711,CHAPTER XI.,"dead--earth seemed to me no longer valuable, than as it contained"
1712,CHAPTER XI.,_him_; and existence a blessing no longer than while I should live to
1713,CHAPTER XI.,be his comforter.
1714,CHAPTER XI.,
1715,CHAPTER XI.,"I began, at leisure, to survey him with more attention. Time and"
1716,CHAPTER XI.,"grief had left few traces of that fine _enthusiasm_, which once"
1717,CHAPTER XI.,"burned in his countenance--his eyes had lost their original fire, but"
1718,CHAPTER XI.,"they retained an uncommon sweetness, and whenever they were turned"
1719,CHAPTER XI.,"upon me, their smile pierced to my heart."
1720,CHAPTER XI.,
1721,CHAPTER XI.,"""Allan, I fear you have been a sufferer?"" He replied not, and I could"
1722,CHAPTER XI.,not press him further. I could not call the dead to life again.
1723,CHAPTER XI.,
1724,CHAPTER XI.,So we drank and told old stories--and repeated old poetry--and sang
1725,CHAPTER XI.,old songs--as if nothing had happened. We sate till very late. I
1726,CHAPTER XI.,forgot that I had purposed returning to town that evening--to Allan
1727,CHAPTER XI.,"all places were alike--I grew noisy, he grew cheerful--Allan's old"
1728,CHAPTER XI.,"manners, old enthusiasm, were returning upon him--we laughed, we"
1729,CHAPTER XI.,"wept, we mingled our tears, and talked extravagantly."
1730,CHAPTER XI.,
1731,CHAPTER XI.,Allan was my chamber-fellow that night--and lay awake planning
1732,CHAPTER XI.,"schemes of living together under the same roof, entering upon similar"
1733,CHAPTER XI.,"pursuits,--and praising GOD, that we had met."
1734,CHAPTER XI.,
1735,CHAPTER XI.,"I was obliged to return to town the next morning, and Allan proposed"
1736,CHAPTER XI.,"to accompany me. ""Since the death of his sister,"" he told me, ""he had"
1737,CHAPTER XI.,"been a wanderer."""
1738,CHAPTER XI.,
1739,CHAPTER XI.,In the course of our walk he unbosomed himself without reserve--told
1740,CHAPTER XI.,me many particulars of his way of life for the last nine or ten
1741,CHAPTER XI.,"years, which I do not feel myself at liberty to divulge."
1742,CHAPTER XI.,
1743,CHAPTER XI.,"Once, on my attempting to cheer him, when I perceived him over"
1744,CHAPTER XI.,"thoughtful, he replied to me in these words:"
1745,CHAPTER XI.,
1746,CHAPTER XI.,"""Do not regard me as unhappy when you catch me in these moods. I am"
1747,CHAPTER XI.,"never more happy than at times when, by the cast of my countenance,"
1748,CHAPTER XI.,men judge me most miserable.
1749,CHAPTER XI.,
1750,CHAPTER XI.,"""My friend, the events which have left this sadness behind them are"
1751,CHAPTER XI.,of no recent date. The melancholy which comes over me with the
1752,CHAPTER XI.,"recollection of them is not hurtful, but only tends to soften and"
1753,CHAPTER XI.,"tranquillize my mind, to detach me from the restlessness of human"
1754,CHAPTER XI.,pursuits.
1755,CHAPTER XI.,
1756,CHAPTER XI.,"""The stronger I feel this detachment, the more I find myself drawn"
1757,CHAPTER XI.,heavenward to the contemplation of spiritual objects.
1758,CHAPTER XI.,
1759,CHAPTER XI.,"""I love to keep old friendships alive and warm within me, because I"
1760,CHAPTER XI.,expect a renewal of them in the _World of Spirits_.
1761,CHAPTER XI.,
1762,CHAPTER XI.,"""I am a wandering and unconnected thing on the earth. I have made no"
1763,CHAPTER XI.,"new friendships, that can compensate me for the loss of the old--and"
1764,CHAPTER XI.,"the more I know mankind, the more does it become necessary for me to"
1765,CHAPTER XI.,"supply their loss by little images, recollections, and circumstances"
1766,CHAPTER XI.,of past pleasures.
1767,CHAPTER XI.,
1768,CHAPTER XI.,"""I am sensible that I am surrounded by a multitude of very worthy"
1769,CHAPTER XI.,"people, plain-hearted souls, sincere and kind. But they have hitherto"
1770,CHAPTER XI.,"eluded my pursuit, and will continue to bless the little circle of"
1771,CHAPTER XI.,"their families and friends, while I must remain a stranger to them."
1772,CHAPTER XI.,
1773,CHAPTER XI.,"""Kept at a distance by mankind, I have not ceased to love them--and"
1774,CHAPTER XI.,"could I find the cruel persecutor, the malignant instrument of GOD'S"
1775,CHAPTER XI.,"judgments on me and mine, I think I would forgive, and try to love"
1776,CHAPTER XI.,him too.
1777,CHAPTER XI.,
1778,CHAPTER XI.,"""I have been a quiet sufferer. From the beginning of my calamities it"
1779,CHAPTER XI.,"was given to me, not to see the hand of man in them. I perceived a"
1780,CHAPTER XI.,"mighty arm, which none but myself could see, extended over me. I gave"
1781,CHAPTER XI.,"my heart to the Purifier, and my will to the Sovereign Will of the"
1782,CHAPTER XI.,Universe. The irresistible wheels of destiny passed on in their
1783,CHAPTER XI.,"everlasting rotation,--and I suffered myself to be carried along"
1784,CHAPTER XI.,"with them without complaining."""

1789,CHAPTER XI.,
1790,CHAPTER XII.,CHAPTER XII.
1791,CHAPTER XII.,
1792,CHAPTER XII.,"Allan told me that for some years past, feeling himself disengaged"
1793,CHAPTER XII.,"from every personal tie, but not alienated from human sympathies, it"
1794,CHAPTER XII.,"had been his taste, his _humor_ he called it, to spend a great"
1795,CHAPTER XII.,portion of his time in _hospitals_ and _lazar-houses_.
1796,CHAPTER XII.,
1797,CHAPTER XII.,"He had found a _wayward pleasure_, he refused to name it a virtue, in"
1798,CHAPTER XII.,"tending a description of people, who had long ceased to expect"
1799,CHAPTER XII.,"kindness or friendliness from mankind, but were content to accept the"
1800,CHAPTER XII.,"reluctant services, which the oftentimes unfeeling instruments and"
1801,CHAPTER XII.,servants of these well-meant institutions deal out to the poor sick
1802,CHAPTER XII.,people under their care.
1803,CHAPTER XII.,
1804,CHAPTER XII.,"It is not medicine, it is not broths and coarse meats, served up at a"
1805,CHAPTER XII.,stated hour with all the hard formalities of a prison--it is not the
1806,CHAPTER XII.,scanty dole of a bed to die on--which dying man requires from his
1807,CHAPTER XII.,species.
1808,CHAPTER XII.,
1809,CHAPTER XII.,"Looks, attentions, consolations,--in a word, _sympathies_, are what a"
1810,CHAPTER XII.,"man most needs in this awful close of mortal sufferings. A kind look,"
1811,CHAPTER XII.,"a smile, a drop of cold water to the parched lip--for these things a"
1812,CHAPTER XII.,man shall bless you in death.
1813,CHAPTER XII.,
1814,CHAPTER XII.,And these better things than cordials did Allan love to
1815,CHAPTER XII.,"administer--to stay by a bedside the whole day, when something"
1816,CHAPTER XII.,disgusting in a patient's distemper has kept the very nurses at a
1817,CHAPTER XII.,"distance--to sit by, while the poor wretch got a little sleep--and be"
1818,CHAPTER XII.,"there to smile upon him when he awoke--to slip a guinea, now and"
1819,CHAPTER XII.,"then, into the hands of a nurse or attendant--these things have been"
1820,CHAPTER XII.,"to Allan as _privileges_, for which he was content to live; choice"
1821,CHAPTER XII.,"marks, and circumstances, of his Maker's goodness to him."
1822,CHAPTER XII.,
1823,CHAPTER XII.,And I do not know whether occupations of this kind be not a spring of
1824,CHAPTER XII.,purer and nobler delight (certainly instances of a more disinterested
1825,CHAPTER XII.,virtue) than arises from what are called Friendships of Sentiment.
1826,CHAPTER XII.,
1827,CHAPTER XII.,"Between two persons of liberal education, like opinions, and common"
1828,CHAPTER XII.,"feelings, oftentimes subsists a Variety of Sentiment, which disposes"
1829,CHAPTER XII.,each to look upon the other as the only being in the universe worthy
1830,CHAPTER XII.,"of friendship, or capable of understanding it,--themselves they"
1831,CHAPTER XII.,consider as the solitary receptacles of all that is delicate in
1832,CHAPTER XII.,"feeling, or stable in attachment: when the odds are, that under every"
1833,CHAPTER XII.,"green hill, and in every crowded street, people of equal worth are to"
1834,CHAPTER XII.,"be found, who do more good in their generation, and make less noise"
1835,CHAPTER XII.,in the doing of it.
1836,CHAPTER XII.,
1837,CHAPTER XII.,"It was in consequence of these benevolent propensities, I have been"
1838,CHAPTER XII.,"describing, that Allan oftentimes discovered considerable"
1839,CHAPTER XII.,"inclinations in favor of my way of life, which I have before"
1840,CHAPTER XII.,mentioned as being that of a surgeon. He would frequently attend me
1841,CHAPTER XII.,on my visits to patients; and I began to think that he had serious
1842,CHAPTER XII.,intentions of making my profession his study.
1843,CHAPTER XII.,
1844,CHAPTER XII.,"He was present with me at a scene--a, _death-bed scene_--I shudder"
1845,CHAPTER XII.,when I do but think of it.

1854,CHAPTER XIII.,"I was sent for the other morning to the assistance of a gentleman,"
1855,CHAPTER XIII.,"who had been wounded in a duel,--and his wounds by unskilful"
1856,CHAPTER XIII.,treatment had been brought to a dangerous crisis.
1857,CHAPTER XIII.,
1858,CHAPTER XIII.,"The uncommonness of the name, which was _Matravis_, suggested to me,"
1859,CHAPTER XIII.,that this might possibly be no other than Allan's old enemy. Under
1860,CHAPTER XIII.,"this apprehension, I did what I could to dissuade Allan from"
1861,CHAPTER XIII.,"accompanying me--but he seemed bent upon going, and even pleased"
1862,CHAPTER XIII.,"himself with the notion, that it might lie within his ability to do"
1863,CHAPTER XIII.,the unhappy man some service. So he went with me.
1864,CHAPTER XIII.,
1865,CHAPTER XIII.,"When we came to the house, which was in Soho-square, we discovered"
1866,CHAPTER XIII.,"that it was indeed the man--the identical Matravis, who had done all"
1867,CHAPTER XIII.,that mischief in times past--but not in a condition to excite any
1868,CHAPTER XIII.,other sensation than pity in a heart more hard than Allan's.
1869,CHAPTER XIII.,
1870,CHAPTER XIII.,Intense pain had brought on a delirium--we perceived this on first
1871,CHAPTER XIII.,entering the room--for the wretched man was raving to
1872,CHAPTER XIII.,"himself--talking idly in mad unconnected sentences--that yet seemed,"
1873,CHAPTER XIII.,"at times, to have reference to _past facts_."
1874,CHAPTER XIII.,
1875,CHAPTER XIII.,"One while he told us his dream. ""He had lost his way on a great"
1876,CHAPTER XIII.,"heath, to which there seemed no end--it was cold, cold, cold,--and"
1877,CHAPTER XIII.,"dark, very dark--an old woman in leading-strings, _blind_, was"
1878,CHAPTER XIII.,"groping about for a guide""--and then he frightened me,--for he seemed"
1879,CHAPTER XIII.,"disposed to be _jocular_, and sang a song about ""an old woman clothed"
1880,CHAPTER XIII.,"in gray,"" and said ""he did not believe in a devil."""
1881,CHAPTER XIII.,
1882,CHAPTER XIII.,"Presently he bid us ""not tell Allan Clare.""--Allan was hanging over"
1883,CHAPTER XIII.,"him at that very moment, sobbing.--I could not resist the impulse,"

1926,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,improved by confining its advantages to the very lowest of the
1927,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"people, let those judge who have witnessed the looks, the gestures,"
1928,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the behavior, the manner of their play with one another, their"

1932,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"of the old Grey Friars--which strangers who have never witnessed, if"
1933,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"they pass through Newgate Street, or by Smithfield, would do well to"
1934,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,go a little out of their way to see.

1936,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,For the Christ's Hospital boy feels that he is no charity-boy; he
1937,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,feels it in the antiquity and regality of the foundation to which he
1938,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"belongs; in the usage which he meets with at school, and the"
1939,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,treatment he is accustomed to out of its bounds; in the respect and
1940,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"even kindness, which his well-known garb never fails to procure him"
1941,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"in the streets of the metropolis; he feels it in his education, in"
1942,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"that measure of classical attainments, which every individual at that"
1943,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"school, though not destined to a learned profession, has it in his"
1944,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"power to procure, attainments which it would be worse than folly to"
1945,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,put it in the reach of the laboring classes to acquire: he feels it
1946,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"in the numberless comforts, and even magnificences, which surround"
1947,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"him; in his old and awful cloisters, with their traditions; in his"
1948,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"spacious school-rooms, and in the well-ordered, airy, and lofty rooms"
1949,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"where he sleeps; in his stately dining-hall, hung round with"
1950,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"pictures, by Verrio, Lely, and others, one of them surpassing in size"
1951,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"and grandeur almost any other in the kingdom;[1] above all, in the"
1952,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"very extent and magnitude of the body to which he belongs, and the"
1953,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"consequent spirit, the intelligence, and public conscience, which is"
1954,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,the result of so many various yet wonderfully combining members.
1955,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"Compared with this last-named advantage, what is the stock of"

1965,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
1966,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"The Christ's Hospital or Blue-coat boy, has a distinctive character"
1967,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"of his own, as far removed from the abject qualities of a common"
1968,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,charity-boy as it is from the disgusting forwardness of a lad brought
1969,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"up at some other of the public schools. There is _pride_ in it,"
1970,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"accumulated from the circumstances which I have described, as"
1971,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,differencing him from the former; and there is _a restraining
1972,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"modesty_ from a sense of obligation and dependence, which must ever"
1973,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,keep his deportment from assimilating to that of the latter. His very
1974,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"garb, as it is antique and venerable, feeds his self-respect; as it"
1975,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"is a badge of dependence, it restrains the natural petulance of that"
1976,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,age from breaking out into overt acts of insolence. This produces
1977,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"silence and a reserve before strangers, yet not that cowardly shyness"
1978,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,which boys mewed up at home will feel; he will speak up when spoken
1979,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to, but the stranger must begin the conversation with him. Within his"
1980,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,bounds he is all fire and play; but in the streets he steals along
1981,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,with all the self-concentration of a young monk. He is never known to
1982,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,mix with other boys; they are a sort of laity to him. All this
1983,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"proceeds, I have no doubt, from the continual consciousness which he"
1984,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"carries about him, of the difference of his dress from that of the"
1985,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"rest of the world; with a modest jealousy over himself, lest, by"
1986,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"overhastily mixing with common and secular playfellows, he should"
1987,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"commit the dignity of his cloth. Nor let any one laugh at this; for,"
1988,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"considering the propensity of the multitude, and especially of the"
1989,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"small multitude, to ridicule anything unusual in dress--above all,"
1990,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,where such peculiarity may be construed by malice into a mark of
1991,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,disparagement--this reserve will appear to be nothing more than a
1992,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,wise instinct in the Blue-coat boy. That it is neither pride nor
1993,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"rusticity, at least that it has none of the offensive qualities of"
1994,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"either, a stranger may soon satisfy himself, by putting a question to"
1995,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,any of these boys: he may be sure of an answer couched in terms of
1996,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"plain civility, neither loquacious nor embarrassed. Let him put the"
1997,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"same question to a parish-boy, or to one of the trencher-caps in the"
1998,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"---- cloisters, and the impudent reply of the one shall not fail to"
1999,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"exasperate any more than the certain servility, and mercenary eye to"
2000,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"reward, which he will meet with in the other, can fail to depress and"
2001,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,sadden him.
2002,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2003,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,The Christ's Hospital boy is a religions character. His school is
2004,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"eminently a religious foundation; it has its peculiar prayers, its"
2005,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"services at set times, its graces, hymns, and anthems, following each"
2006,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,other in an almost monastic closeness of succession. This religious
2007,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,character in him is not always untinged with superstition. That is
2008,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"not wonderful, when we consider the thousand tales and traditions"
2009,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"which must circulate, with undisturbed credulity, amongst so many"
2010,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"boys, that have so few checks to their belief from any intercourse"
2011,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,with the world at large; upon whom their equals in age must work so
2012,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"much, their elders so little. With this leaning towards an"
2013,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"over-belief in matters of religion, which will soon correct itself"
2014,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"when he comes out into society, may be classed a turn for romance"
2015,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,above most other boys. This is to be traced in the same manner to
2016,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"their excess of society with each other, and defect of mingling with"
2017,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,the world. Hence the peculiar avidity with which such books as the
2018,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"""Arabian Nights' Entertainments,"" and others of a still wilder cast,"
2019,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"are, or at least were in my time, sought for by the boys. I remember"
2020,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"when some half-dozen of them set off from school, without map, card,"
2021,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"or compass, on a serious expedition to find out _Philip Quarll's"
2022,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,Island_.
2023,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2024,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,The Christ's Hospital boy's sense of right and wrong is peculiarly
2025,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,tender and apprehensive. It is even apt to run out into ceremonial
2026,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"observances, and to impose a yoke upon itself beyond the strict"
2027,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,obligations of the moral law. Those who were contemporaries with me
2028,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"at that school thirty years ago, will remember with what more than"
2029,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,Judaic rigor the eating of the fat of certain boiled meats[1] was
2030,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,interdicted. A boy would have blushed as at the exposure of some
2031,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"heinous immorality, to have been detected eating that forbidden"
2032,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"portion of his allowance of animal food, the whole of which, while he"
2033,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"was in health, was little more than sufficient to allay his hunger."
2034,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"The same, or even greater, refinement was shown in the rejection of"
2035,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,certain kinds of sweet-cake. What gave rise to these supererogatory
2036,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"penances, these self-denying ordinances, I could never learn;[2] they"
2037,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,certainly argue no defect of the conscientious principle. A little
2038,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"excess in that article is not undesirable in youth, to make allowance"
2039,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,for the inevitable waste which comes in maturer years. But in the
2040,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"less ambiguous line of duty, in those directions of the moral"
2041,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"feelings which cannot be mistaken or depreciated, I will relate what"
2042,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"took place in the year 1785, when Mr. Perry, the steward, died. I"
2043,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"must be pardoned for taking my instances from my own times. Indeed,"
2044,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the vividness of my recollections, while I am upon this subject,"
2045,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,almost bring back those times; they are present to me still. But I
2046,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,believe that in the years which have elapsed since the period which I
2047,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"speak of, the character of the Christ's Hospital boy is very little"
2048,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,changed. Their situation in point of many comforts is improved; but
2049,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,that which I ventured before to term the _public conscience_ of the
2050,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"school, the pervading moral sense, of which every mind partakes and"
2051,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to which so many individual minds contribute, remains, I believe,"
2052,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"pretty much the same as when I left it. I have seen, within this"
2053,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"twelvemonth almost, the change which has been produced upon a boy of"
2054,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"eight or nine years of age, upon being admitted into that school;"
2055,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"how, from a pert young coxcomb, who thought that all knowledge was"
2056,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"comprehended within his shallow brains, because a smattering of two"
2057,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,or three languages and one or two sciences were stuffed into him by
2058,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"injudicious treatment at home, by a mixture with the wholesome"
2059,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"society of so many school-fellows, in less time than I have spoken"
2060,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"of, he has sunk to his own level, and is contented to be carried on"
2061,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,in the quiet orbit of modest self-knowledge in which the common mass
2062,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,of that unpresumptuous assemblage of boys seem to move: from being a
2063,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"little unfeeling mortal, he has got to feel and reflect. Nor would it"
2064,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"be a difficult matter to show how, at a school like this, where the"
2065,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"boy is neither entirely separated from home, nor yet exclusively"
2066,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"under its influence, the best feelings, the filial for instance, are"
2067,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,brought to a maturity which they could not have attained under a
2068,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,completely domestic education; how the relation of a parent is
2069,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"rendered less tender by unremitted association, and the very"
2070,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,awfulness of age is best apprehended by some sojourning amidst the
2071,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"comparative levity of youth; how absence, not drawn out by too great"
2072,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"extension into alienation or forgetfulness, puts an edge upon the"
2073,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"relish of occasional intercourse, and the boy is made the better"
2074,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,_child_ by that which keeps the force of that relation from being
2075,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"felt as perpetually pressing on him; how the substituted paternity,"
2076,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"into the care of which he is adopted, while in everything substantial"
2077,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"it makes up for the natural, in the necessary omission of individual"
2078,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"fondnesses and partialities, directs the mind only the more strongly"
2079,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to appreciate that natural and first tie, in which such weaknesses"
2080,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"are the bond of strength, and the appetite which craves after them"
2081,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,betrays no perverse palate. But these speculations rather belong to
2082,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,the question of the comparative advantages of a public over a private
2083,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,education in general. I must get back to my favorite school; and to
2084,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,that which took place when our old and good steward died.
2085,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2086,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,[Footnote 1: Under the denomination of _gage_.]
2087,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2088,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"[Footnote 2: I am told that the late steward [Mr. Hathaway], who"
2089,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,evinced on many occasions a most praiseworthy anxiety to promote the
2090,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"comfort of the boys, had occasion for all his address and"
2091,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"perseverance to eradicate the first of these unfortunate prejudices,"
2092,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"in which he at length happily succeeded, and thereby restored to one"
2093,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,half of the animal nutrition of the school those honors which painful
2094,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,superstition and blind zeal had so long conspired to withhold from
2095,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,it.]
2096,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2097,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,And I will say that when I think of the frequent instances which I
2098,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"have met with in children, of a hard-heartedness, a callousness, and"
2099,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"insensibility to the loss of relations, even of those who have begot"
2100,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"and nourished them, I cannot but consider it as a proof of something"
2101,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"in the peculiar conformation of that school, favorable to the"
2102,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"expansion of the best feelings of our nature, that at the period"
2103,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"which I am noticing, out of five hundred boys there was not a dry eye"
2104,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to be found among them, nor a heart that did not beat with genuine"
2105,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"emotion. Every impulse to play, until the funeral day was past,"
2106,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"seemed suspended throughout the school; and the boys, lately so"
2107,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"mirthful and sprightly, were seen pacing their cloisters alone, or in"
2108,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"sad groups standing about, few of them without some token, such as"
2109,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"their slender means could provide, a black riband or something, to"
2110,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,denote respect and a sense of their loss. The time itself was a time
2111,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"of anarchy, a time in which all authority (out of school hours) was"
2112,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,abandoned. The ordinary restraints were for those days superseded;
2113,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"and the gates, which at other times kept us in, were left without"
2114,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"watchers. Yet, with the exception of one or two graceless boys at"
2115,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"most, who took advantage of that suspension of authorities to _skulk"
2116,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"out_, as it was called, the whole body of that great school kept"
2117,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"rigorously within their bounds, by a voluntary self-imprisonment; and"
2118,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"they who broke bounds, though they escaped punishment from any"
2119,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"master, fell into a general disrepute among us, and, for that which"
2120,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,at any other time would have been applauded and admired as a mark of
2121,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"spirit, were consigned to infamy and reprobation; so much _natural"
2122,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"government_ have gratitude and the principles of reverence and love,"
2123,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,and so much did a respect to their dead friend prevail with these
2124,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"Christ's Hospital boys, above any fear which his presence among them"
2125,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,when living could ever produce. And if the impressions which were
2126,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"made on my mind so long ago are to be trusted, very richly did their"
2127,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,steward deserve this tribute. It is a pleasure to me even now to call
2128,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to mind his portly form, the regal awe which he always contrived to"
2129,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"inspire, in spite of a tenderness and even weakness of nature that"
2130,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,would have enfeebled the reins of discipline in any other master; a
2131,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"yearning of tenderness towards those under his protection, which"
2132,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,could make five hundred boys at once feel towards him each as to
2133,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"their individual father. He had faults, with which we had nothing to"
2134,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"do; but, with all his faults, indeed, Mr. Perry was a most"
2135,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"extraordinary creature. Contemporary with him and still living,"
2136,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"though he has long since resigned his occupation, will it be"
2137,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,impertinent to mention the name of our excellent upper
2138,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"grammar-master, the Rev. James Boyer? He was a disciplinarian,"
2139,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"indeed, of a different stamp from him whom I have just described;"
2140,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"but, now the terrors of the rod, and of a temper a little too hasty"
2141,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,to leave the more nervous of us quite at our ease to do justice to
2142,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"his merits in those days, are long since over, ungrateful were we if"
2143,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,we should refuse our testimony to that unwearied assiduity with which
2144,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,he attended to the particular improvement of each of us. Had we been
2145,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the offspring of the first gentry in the land, he could not have been"
2146,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,instigated by the strongest views of recompense and reward to have
2147,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,made himself a greater slave to the most laborious of all occupations
2148,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"than he did for us sons of charity, from whom, or from our parents,"
2149,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,he could expect nothing. He has had his reward in the satisfaction of
2150,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"having discharged his duty, in the pleasurable consciousness of"
2151,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"having advanced the respectability of that institution to which, both"
2152,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"man and boy, he was attached; in the honors to which so many of his"
2153,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,pupils have successfully aspired at both our Universities; and in the
2154,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"staff with which the Governors of the Hospital, at the close of his"
2155,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"hard labors, with the highest expressions of the obligations the"
2156,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"school lay under to him, unanimously voted to present him."
2157,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2158,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,I have often considered it among the felicities of the constitution
2159,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"of this school, that the offices of steward and school-master are"
2160,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,kept distinct; the strict business of education alone devolving upon
2161,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the latter, while the former has the charge of all things out of"
2162,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"school, the control of the provisions, the regulation of meals, of"
2163,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"dress, of play, and the ordinary intercourse of the boys. By this"
2164,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"division of management, a superior respectability must attach to the"
2165,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"teacher, while his office is unmixed with any of these lower"
2166,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,concerns. A still greater advantage over the construction of common
2167,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,boarding-schools is to be found in the settled salaries of the
2168,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"masters, rendering them totally free of obligation to any individual"
2169,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"pupil, or his parents. This never fails to have its effect at schools"
2170,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,where each boy can reckon up to a hair what profit the master derives
2171,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"from him, where he views him every day in the light of a caterer, a"
2172,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"provider for the family, who is to get so much by him in each of his"
2173,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,meals. Boys will see and consider these things; and how much must the
2174,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,sacred character of preceptor suffer in their minds by these
2175,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,degrading associations! The very bill which the pupil carries home
2176,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"with him at Christmas, eked out, perhaps, with elaborate though"
2177,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"necessary minuteness, instructs him that his teachers have other ends"
2178,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"than the mere love to learning, in the lessons which they give him;"
2179,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,and though they put into his hands the fine sayings of Seneca or
2180,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"Epictetus, yet they themselves are none of those disinterested"
2181,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"pedagogues to teach philosophy _gratis_. The master, too, is sensible"
2182,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,that he is seen in this light; and how much this must lessen that
2183,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,affectionate regard to the learners which alone can sweeten the
2184,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"bitter labor of instruction, and convert the whole business into"
2185,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"unwelcome and uninteresting task-work, many preceptors that I have"
2186,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"conversed with on the subject are ready, with a sad heart, to"
2187,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,acknowledge. From this inconvenience the settled salaries of the
2188,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,masters of this school in great measure exempt them; while the happy
2189,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,custom of choosing masters (indeed every officer of the
2190,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"establishment) from those who have received their education there,"
2191,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"gives them an interest in advancing the character of the school, and"
2192,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"binds them to observe a tenderness and a respect to the children, in"
2193,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"which a stranger, feeling that independence which I have spoken of,"
2194,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,might well be expected to fail.
2195,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2196,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"In affectionate recollections of the place where he was bred up, in"
2197,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,hearty recognitions of old school-fellows met with again after the
2198,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"lapse of years, or in foreign countries, the Christ's Hospital boy"
2199,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"yields to none; I might almost say, he goes beyond most other boys."
2200,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"The very compass and magnitude of the school, its thousand bearings,"
2201,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the space it takes up in the imagination beyond the ordinary schools,"
2202,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"impresses a remembrance, accompanied with an elevation of mind, that"
2203,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"attends him through life. It is too big, too affecting an object, to"
2204,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,pass away quickly from his mind. The Christ's Hospital boy's friends
2205,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"at school are commonly his intimates through life. For me, I do not"
2206,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,know whether a constitutional imbecility does not incline me too
2207,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,obstinately to cling to the remembrances of childhood; in an inverted
2208,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"ratio to the usual sentiments of mankind, nothing that I have been"
2209,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,engaged in since seems of any value or importance compared to the
2210,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,colors which imagination gave to everything then. I belong to no
2211,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"_body corporate_ such as I then made a part of.--And here, before I"
2212,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"close, taking leave of the general reader, and addressing myself"
2213,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"solely to my old school-fellows, that were contemporaries with me"
2214,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"from the year 1782 to 1789, let me have leave to remember some of"
2215,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"those circumstances of our school, which they will not be unwilling"
2216,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,to have brought back to their minds.
2217,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2218,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"And first, let us remember, as first in importance in our childish"
2219,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"eyes, the young men (as they almost were) who, under the denomination"
2220,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"of _Grecians_, were waiting the expiration of the period when they"
2221,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"should be sent, at the charges of the Hospital, to one or other of"
2222,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"our universities, but more frequently to Cambridge. These youths,"
2223,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"from their superior acquirements, their superior age and stature, and"
2224,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,the fewness of their numbers (for seldom above two or three at a time
2225,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"were inaugurated into that high order), drew the eyes of all, and"
2226,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"especially of the younger boys, into a reverent observance and"
2227,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,admiration. How tall they used to seem to us! how stately would they
2228,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,pace along the cloisters! while the play of the lesser boys was
2229,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"absolutely suspended, or its boisterousness at least allayed, at"
2230,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,their presence! Not that they ever beat or struck the boys--that
2231,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,would have been to have demeaned themselves--the dignity of their
2232,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"persons alone insured them all respect. The task of blows, of"
2233,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"corporal chastisement, they left to the common monitors, or heads of"
2234,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"wards, who, it must be confessed, in our time had rather too much"
2235,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,license allowed them to oppress and misuse their inferiors; and the
2236,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"interference of the Grecian, who may be considered as the spiritual"
2237,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"power, was not unfrequently called for, to mitigate by its mediation"
2238,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the heavy unrelenting arm of this temporal power, or monitor. In"
2239,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"fine, the Grecians were the solemn Muftis of the school. Eras were"
2240,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"computed from their time;--it used to be said, such or such a thing"
2241,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,was done when S---- or T---- was Grecian.
2242,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,
2243,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"As I ventured to call the Grecians, the Muftis of the school, the"
2244,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"King's boys,[1] as their character then was, may well pass for the"
2245,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,Janissaries. They were the terror of all the other boys; bred up
2246,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"under that hardy sailor, as well as excellent mathematician and"
2247,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"conavigator with Captain Cook, William Wales. All his systems were"
2248,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,adapted to fit them for the rough element which they were destined to
2249,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,encounter. Frequent and severe punishments which were expected to be
2250,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"borne with more than Spartan fortitude, came to be considered less as"
2251,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,inflictions of disgrace than as trials of obstinate endurance. To
2252,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"make his boys hardy, and to give them early sailor-habits, seemed to"
2253,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,be his only aim; to this everything was subordinate. Moral
2254,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"obliquities, indeed, were sure of receiving their full recompense,"
2255,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,for no occasion of laying on the lash was ever let slip; but the
2256,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,effects expected to be produced from it were something very different
2257,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,from contrition or mortification. There was in William Wales a
2258,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"perpetual fund of humor, a constant glee about him, which, heightened"
2259,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"by an inveterate provincialism of north-country dialect, absolutely"
2260,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,took away the sting from his severities. His punishments were a game
2261,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"at patience, in which the master was not always worst contented when"
2262,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,he found himself at times overcome by his pupil. What success this
2263,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"discipline had, or how the effects of it operated upon the"
2264,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"after-lives of these King's boys, I cannot say: but I am sure that,"
2265,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"for the time, they were absolute nuisances to the rest of the school."
2266,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"Hardy, brutal, and often wicked, they were the most graceless lump in"
2267,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the whole mass; older and bigger than the other boys, (for, by the"
2268,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,system of their education they were kept longer at school by two or
2269,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"three years than any of the rest, except the Grecians,) they were a"
2270,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,constant terror to the younger part of the school; and some who may
2271,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"read this, I doubt not, will remember the consternation into which"
2272,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the juvenile fry of us were thrown, when the cry was raised in the"
2273,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"cloisters, that _the First Order was coming_--for so they termed the"
2274,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,first form or class of those boys. Still these sea-boys answered some
2275,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"good purposes, in the school. They were the military class among the"
2276,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"boys, foremost in athletic exercises, who extended the fame of the"
2277,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,prowess of the school far and near; and the apprentices in the
2278,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"vicinage, and sometimes the butchers' boys in the neighboring market,"
2279,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,had sad occasion to attest their valor.

2291,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"in the water, never caring for dressing ourselves, when we had once"
2292,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"stripped; our savory meals afterwards, when we came home almost"
2293,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,famished with staying out all day without our dinners; our visits at
2294,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"other times to the Tower, where, by ancient privilege, we had free"
2295,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,access to all the curiosities; our solemn procession through the City
2296,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"at Easter, with the Lord Mayor's largess of buns, wine, and a"
2297,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"shilling, with the festive questions and civic pleasantries of the"
2298,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"dispensing Aldermen, which were more to us than all the rest of the"
2299,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"banquet; our stately suppings in public, where the well-lighted hall"
2300,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"and the confluence of well-dressed company who came to see us, made"
2301,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"the whole look more like a concert or assembly, than a scene of a"
2302,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,plain bread and cheese collation; the annual orations upon St.

2306,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"critics and Greek scholars, Joshua Barnes and Jeremiah Markland (I"
2307,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,marvel they left out Camden while they were about it). Let me have
2308,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"leave to remember our hymns and anthems, and well-toned organ; the"
2309,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"doleful tune of the burial anthem chanted in the solemn cloisters,"
2310,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,upon the seldom-occurring funeral of some school-fellow; the

2312,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to have a gaudy day, sitting round the fire, replenished to the"
2313,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"height with logs, and the penniless, and he that could contribute"
2314,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"nothing, partook in all the mirth, and in some of the"
2315,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,substantialities of the feasting; the carol sung by night at that
2316,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"time of the year, which, when a young boy, I have so often lain awake"
2317,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"to hear from seven (the hour of going to bed) till ten, when it was"
2318,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"sung by the older boys and monitors, and have listened to it, in"
2319,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,"their rude chanting, till I have been transported in fancy to the"

2323,RECOLLECTIONS OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.,Nor would I willingly forget any of those things which administered

2469,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"It may seem a paradox, but I cannot help being of opinion that the"

2472,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,distinguishing excellence is a reason that they should be so. There

2528,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"being dragged forth as the public schoolmaster, to give lectures to"
2529,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"the crowd! Why, nine parts in ten of what Hamlet does, are"
2530,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,transactions between himself and his moral sense; they are the
2531,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"effusions of his solitary musings, which he retires to holes and"

2537,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"tongue scarce dares utter to deaf walls and chambers, how can they be"
2538,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"represented by a gesticulating actor, who comes and mouths them out"
2539,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"before an audience, making four hundred people his confidants at"
2540,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,once! I say not that it is the fault of the actor so to do; he must
2541,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,pronounce them _ore rotundo_; he must accompany them with his eye; he
2542,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"must insinuate them into his auditory by some trick of eye, tone or"
2543,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"gesture, or he fails. _He must be thinking all the while of his"

2553,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,but how much Hamlet is made another thing by being acted. I have
2554,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,heard much of the wonders which Garrick performed in this part; but
2555,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"as I never saw him, I must have leave to doubt whether the"
2556,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,representation of such a character came within the province of his
2557,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"art. Those who tell me of him, speak of his eye, of the magic of his"
2558,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"eye, and of his commanding voice: physical properties, vastly"
2559,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"desirable in an actor, and without which he can never insinuate"

2561,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"have they to do with intellect? In fact, the things aimed at in"
2562,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"theatrical representation, are to arrest the spectator's eye upon the"
2563,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"form and the gesture, and so to gain a more favorable hearing to what"
2564,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"is spoken: it is not what the character is, but how he looks; not"
2565,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"what he says, but how he speaks it. I see no reason to think that if"
2566,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,the play of Hamlet were written over again by some such writer as
2567,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"Banks or Lillo, retaining the process of the story, but totally"
2568,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"omitting all the poetry of it, all the divine features of Shakspeare,"
2569,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,his stupendous intellect; and only taking care to give us enough of
2570,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"passionate dialogue, which Banks or Lillo were never at a loss to"
2571,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,furnish; I see not how the effect could be much different upon an
2572,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"audience, nor how the actor has it in his power to represent"
2573,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,Shakspeare to us differently from his representation of Banks or
2574,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"Lillo. Hamlet would still be a youthful accomplished prince, and must"
2575,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"be gracefully personated; he might be puzzled in his mind, wavering"
2576,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"in his conduct, seemingly cruel to Ophelia; he might see a ghost, and"
2577,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"start at it, and address it kindly when he found it to be his father;"
2578,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,all this in the poorest and most homely language of the servilest
2579,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,creeper after nature that ever consulted the palate of an audience;
2580,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,without troubling Shakspeare for the matter: and I see not but there
2581,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"would be room for all the power which an actor has, to display"
2582,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,itself. All the passions and changes of passion might remain: for
2583,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,those are much less difficult to write or act than is thought; it is
2584,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"a trick easy to be attained, it is but rising or falling a note or"

2647,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"powers which he positively creates in us, for nothing more than"
2648,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"indigenous faculties of our own minds, which only waited the"

2651,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,
2652,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,To return to Hamlet.--Among the distinguishing features of that
2653,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"wonderful character, one of the most interesting (yet painful) is"
2654,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,that soreness of mind which makes him treat the intrusions of
2655,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"Polonius with harshness, and that asperity which he puts on in his"
2656,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,interviews with Ophelia. These tokens of an unhinged mind (if they be
2657,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"not mixed in the latter case with a profound artifice of love, to"
2658,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"alienate Ophelia by affected discourtesies, so to prepare her mind"
2659,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"for the breaking off of that loving intercourse, which can no longer"
2660,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,find a place amidst business so serious as that which he has to do)
2661,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"are parts of his character, which to reconcile with our admiration of"
2662,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"Hamlet, the most patient consideration of his situation is no more"
2663,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"than necessary; they are what we _forgive afterwards_, and explain by"
2664,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"the whole of his character, but _at the time_ they are harsh and"
2665,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,unpleasant. Yet such is the actor's necessity of giving strong blows
2666,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"to the audience, that I have never seen a player in this character,"
2667,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,who did not exaggerate and strain to the utmost these ambiguous
2668,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"features,--these temporary deformities in the character. They make"
2669,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,him express a vulgar scorn at Polonius which utterly degrades his
2670,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"gentility, and which no explanation can render palatable; they make"
2671,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"him show contempt, and curl up the nose at Ophelia's"
2672,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"father,--contempt in its very grossest and most hateful form; but"
2673,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"they get applause by it: it is natural, people say; that is, the"
2674,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"words are scornful, and the actor expresses scorn, and that they can"
2675,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"judge of: but why so much scorn, and of that sort, they never think"
2676,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,of asking.
2677,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,
2678,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"So to Ophelia.--All the Hamlets that I have ever seen, rant and rave"
2679,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"at her as if she had committed some great crime, and the audience are"
2680,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"highly pleased, because the words of the part are satirical, and they"
2681,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,are enforced by the strongest expression of satirical indignation of

2683,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,likely to have put on such brutal appearances to a lady whom he loved
2684,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"so dearly, is never thought on. The truth is, that in all such deep"
2685,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"affections as had subsisted between Hamlet and Ophelia, there is a"
2686,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"stock of _supererogatory love_, (if I may venture to use the"
2687,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"expression,) which in any great grief of heart, especially where that"
2688,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"which preys upon the mind cannot be communicated, confers a kind of"
2689,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"indulgence upon the grieved party to express itself, even to its"
2690,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"heart's dearest object, in the language of a temporary alienation;"
2691,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"but it is not alienation, it is a distraction purely, and so it"
2692,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"always makes itself to be felt by that object: it is not anger, but"
2693,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"grief assuming the appearance of anger,--love awkwardly"
2694,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"counterfeiting hate, as sweet countenances when they try to frown:"
2695,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"but such sternness and fierce disgust as Hamlet is made to show, is"
2696,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"no counterfeit, but the real face of absolute aversion,--of"
2697,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,irreconcilable alienation. It may be said he puts on the madman; but
2698,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,then he should only so far put on this counterfeit lunacy as his own
2699,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"real distraction will give him leave; that is, incompletely,"
2700,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"imperfectly; not in that confirmed, practised way, like a master of"
2701,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"his art, or as Dame Quickly would say, ""like one of those harlotry"

2703,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,
2704,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"I mean no disrespect to any actor, but the sort of pleasure which"
2705,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,Shakspeare's plays give in the acting seems to me not at all to

2707,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"writers; and, _they being in themselves essentially so different from"
2708,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"all others_, I must conclude that there is something in the nature of"
2709,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"acting which levels all distinctions. And, in fact, who does not"
2710,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,speak indifferently of the Gamester and of Macbeth as fine
2711,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"stage-performances, and praise the Mrs. Beverley in the same way as"
2712,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"the Lady Macbeth of Mrs. S.? Belvidera, and Calista, and Isabella,"
2713,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"and Euphrasia, are they less liked than Imogen, or than Juliet, or"
2714,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,than Desdemona? Are they not spoken of and remembered in the same

2740,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"that, by every tradition of him, appears to have been as mere a"

2742,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"players' vices,--envy and jealousy, and miserable cravings after"
2743,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,applause; one who in the exercise of his profession was jealous even
2744,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,of the women-performers that stood in his way; a manager full of
2745,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,managerial tricks and stratagems and finesse; that any resemblance

2755,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,I am almost disposed to deny to Garrick the merit of being an admirer

2770,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"acting, it is as well calculated as any. But we have seen the part of"
2771,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,Richard lately produce great fame to an actor by his manner of

2773,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,judgments of Shakspeare derived from acting. Not one of the
2774,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"spectators who have witnessed Mr. C.'s exertions in that part, but"
2775,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,has come away with a proper conviction that Richard is a very wicked
2776,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"man, and kills little children in their beds, with something like the"
2777,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,pleasure which the giants and ogres in children's books are
2778,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"represented to have taken in that practice; moreover, that he is very"
2779,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"close and shrewd, and devilish cunning, for you could see that by his"
2780,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,eye.
2781,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,
2782,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"But is, in fact, this the impression we have in reading the Richard"
2783,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"of Shakspeare? Do we feel anything like disgust, as we do at that"
2784,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,butcherlike representation of him that passes for him on the stage? A
2785,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"horror at his crimes blends with the effect which we feel, but how is"
2786,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"it qualified, how is it carried off, by the rich intellect which he"
2787,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"displays, his resources, his wit, his buoyant spirits, his vast"
2788,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"knowledge and insight into characters, the poetry of his part,--not"
2789,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,an atom of all which is made perceivable in Mr. C.'s way of acting
2790,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"it. Nothing but his crimes, his actions, is visible; they are"
2791,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"prominent and staring; the murderer stands out, but where is the"
2792,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"lofty genius, the man of vast capacity,--the profound, the witty,"
2793,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,accomplished Richard?
2794,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,
2795,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"The truth is, the characters of Shakspeare are so much the objects of"
2796,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"meditation rather than of interest or curiosity as to their actions,"
2797,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,that while we are reading any of his great criminal
2798,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"characters,--Macbeth, Richard, even Iago,--we think not so much of"
2799,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"the crimes which they commit, as of the ambition, the aspiring"
2800,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"spirit, the intellectual activity, which prompts them to overleap"
2801,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,these moral fences. Barnwell is a wretched murderer; there is a
2802,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,certain fitness between his neck and the rope; he is the legitimate
2803,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,heir to the gallows; nobody who thinks at all can think of any
2804,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,alleviating circumstances in his case to make him a fit object of
2805,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"mercy. Or to take an instance from the higher tragedy, what else but"
2806,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,a mere assassin is Glenalvon? Do we think of anything but of the
2807,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"crime which he commits, and the rack which he deserves? That is all"
2808,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,which we really think about him. Whereas in corresponding characters
2809,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"in Shakspeare, so little do the actions comparatively affect us, that"
2810,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"while the impulses, the inner mind in all its perverted greatness,"
2811,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"solely seems real and is exclusively attended to, the crime is"
2812,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"comparatively nothing. But when we see these things represented, the"
2813,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"acts which they do are comparatively everything, their impulses"
2814,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,nothing. The state of sublime emotion into which we are elevated by

2816,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,solemn prelude with which he entertains the time till the bell shall

2819,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"abstraction which reading possesses over seeing, and come to see a"
2820,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,man in his bodily shape before our eyes actually preparing to commit
2821,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"a murder, if the acting be true and impressive, as I have witnessed"
2822,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"it in Mr. K.'s performance of that part, the painful anxiety about"
2823,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"the act, the natural longing to prevent it while it yet seems"
2824,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"unperpetrated, the too close pressing semblance of reality, give a"
2825,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,pain and an uneasiness which totally destroy all the delight which
2826,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"the words in the book convey, where the deed doing never presses upon"
2827,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,us with the painful sense of presence; it rather seems to belong to
2828,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"history,--to something past and inevitable, if it has anything to do"
2829,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"with time at all. The sublime images, the poetry alone, is that which"
2830,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,is present to our minds in the reading.

2836,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,which the acting of Lear ever produced in me. But the Lear of

2842,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"The greatness of Lear is not in corporal dimension, but in"
2843,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,intellectual: the explosions of his passion are terrible as a

2895,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,the courtship and wedded caresses of Othello and Desdemona; and
2896,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,whether the actual sight of the thing did not overweigh all that
2897,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,beautiful compromise which we make in reading;--and the reason it
2898,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"should do so is obvious, because there is just so much reality"
2899,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"presented to our senses as to give a perception of disagreement, with"
2900,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"not enough of belief in the internal motives,--all that which is"

2902,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,prejudices.[1] What we see upon a stage is body and bodily action;
2903,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,"what we are conscious of in reading is almost exclusively the mind,"
2904,CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR STAGE-REPRESENTATION.,and its movements; and this I think may sufficiently account for the

3115,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,modest pretensions compared with the thundering vaunts of this
3116,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"Scythian Shepherd. He comes in drawn by conquered kings, and"
3117,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,reproaches these _pampered jades of Asia_ that they can _draw but
3118,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"twenty miles a day_. Till I saw this passage with my own eyes, I"
3119,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,never believed that it was anything more than a pleasant burlesque of
3120,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,mine Ancient's. But I can assure my readers that it is soberly set
3121,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"down in a play, which their ancestors took to be serious."
3122,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,
3123,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,_Edward the Second_.--In a very different style from mighty
3124,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,Tamburlaine is the Tragedy of Edward the Second. The reluctant pangs
3125,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"of abdicating royalty in Edward furnished hints, which Shakspeare"
3126,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,scarcely improved in his Richard the Second; and the death-scene of
3127,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,Marlowe's king moves pity and terror beyond any scene ancient or
3128,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,modern with which I am acquainted.

3130,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,_The Rich Jew of Malta_.--Marlowe's Jew does not approach so near to
3131,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"Shakspeare's, as his Edward the Second does to Richard the Second."
3132,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,Barabas is a mere monster brought in with a large painted nose to
3133,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"please the rabble. He kills in sport, poisons whole nunneries,"
3134,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,invents infernal machines. He is just such an exhibition as a century
3135,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"or two earlier might have been played before the Londoners ""by the"
3136,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"royal command,"" when a general pillage and massacre of the Hebrews"
3137,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,had been previously resolved on in the cabinet. It is curious to see
3138,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"a superstition wearing out. The idea of a Jew, which our pious"
3139,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"ancestors contemplated with so much horror, has nothing in it now"
3140,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"revolting. We have tamed the claws of the beast, and pared its nails,"
3141,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"and now we take it to our arms, fondle it, write plays to flatter it;"
3142,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"it is visited by princes, affects a taste, patronizes the arts, and"
3143,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,is the only liberal and gentlemanlike thing in Christendom.
3144,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,
3145,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,_Doctor Faustus_.--The growing horrors of Faustus's last scene are
3146,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"awfully marked by the hours and half hours as they expire, and bring"
3147,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,him nearer and nearer to the exactment of his dire compact. It is
3148,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,indeed an agony and a fearful colluctation. Marlowe is said to have
3149,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"been tainted with atheistical positions, to have denied God and the"
3150,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,Trinity. To such a genius the history of Faustus must have been
3151,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,delectable food: to wander in fields where curiosity is forbidden to
3152,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"go, to approach the dark gulf, near enough to look in, to be busied"
3153,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,in speculations which are the rottenest part of the core of the fruit
3154,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"that fell from the tree of knowledge.[1] Barabas the Jew, and Faustus"
3155,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"the conjurer, are offsprings of a mind which at least delighted to"
3156,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,dally with interdicted subjects. They both talk a language which a
3157,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,believer would have been tender of putting into the mouth of a
3158,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,character though but in fiction. But the holiest minds have sometimes
3159,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,not thought it reprehensible to counterfeit impiety in the person of
3160,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"another, to bring Vice upon the stage speaking her own dialect; and,"
3161,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"themselves being armed with an unction of self-confident impunity,"
3162,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,have not scrupled to handle and touch that familiarly which would be
3163,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"death to others. Milton, in the person of Satan, has started"
3164,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,speculations hardier than any which the feeble armory of the atheist
3165,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"ever furnished; and the precise, strait-laced Richardson has"
3166,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"strengthened Vice, from the mouth of Lovelace, with entangling"
3167,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"sophistries and abstruse pleas against her adversary Virtue, which"
3168,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,"Sedley, Villiers, and Rochester wanted depth of libertinism enough to"
3169,CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.,have invented.

3182,THOMAS DECKER.,"himself, being a prisoner in the English king's court, is enamored to"
3183,THOMAS DECKER.,"frenzy of the king's daughter Agripyna, is done to the life. Orleans"
3184,THOMAS DECKER.,is as passionate an inamorato as any which Shakspeare ever drew. He

3193,THOMAS DECKER.,sectaries are a reason unto themselves. We have gone retrograde to
3194,THOMAS DECKER.,"the noble heresy, since the days when Sidney proselyted our nation to"
3195,THOMAS DECKER.,"this mixed health and disease: the kindliest symptom, yet the most"
3196,THOMAS DECKER.,"alarming crisis, in the ticklish state of youth; the nourisher and"
3197,THOMAS DECKER.,"the destroyer of hopeful wits; the mother of twin births, wisdom and"
3198,THOMAS DECKER.,"folly, valor and weakness; the servitude above freedom; the gentle"
3199,THOMAS DECKER.,mind's religion; the liberal superstition.
3200,THOMAS DECKER.,
3201,THOMAS DECKER.,"_The Honest Whore_.--There is in the second part of this play, where"
3202,THOMAS DECKER.,"Bellafront, a reclaimed harlot, recounts some of the miseries of her"
3203,THOMAS DECKER.,"profession, a simple picture of honor and shame, contrasted without"
3204,THOMAS DECKER.,"violence, and expressed without immodesty; which is worth all the"
3205,THOMAS DECKER.,"_strong lines_ against the harlot's profession, with which both parts"
3206,THOMAS DECKER.,of this play are offensively crowded. A satirist is always to be
3207,THOMAS DECKER.,"suspected, who, to make vice odious, dwells upon all its acts and"
3208,THOMAS DECKER.,minutest circumstances with a sort of relish and retrospective
3209,THOMAS DECKER.,"fondness. But so near are the boundaries of panegyric and invective,"
3210,THOMAS DECKER.,that a worn-out sinner is sometimes found to make the best declaimer
3211,THOMAS DECKER.,"against sin. The same high-seasoned descriptions, which in his"
3212,THOMAS DECKER.,"unregenerate state served but to inflame his appetites, in his new"
3213,THOMAS DECKER.,"province of a moralist will serve him, a little turned, to expose the"
3214,THOMAS DECKER.,"enormity of those appetites in other men. When Cervantes, with such"
3215,THOMAS DECKER.,"proficiency of fondness dwells upon the Don's library, who sees not"
3216,THOMAS DECKER.,that he has been a great reader of books of knight-errantry--perhaps
3217,THOMAS DECKER.,was at some time of his life in danger of falling into those very

3226,JOHN MARSTON.,"his country, with the loss of a son supposed drowned, is cast upon"
3227,JOHN MARSTON.,"the territory of his mortal enemy the Duke of Venice, with no"
3228,JOHN MARSTON.,"attendants but Lucio, an old nobleman, and a page--resembles that of"
3229,JOHN MARSTON.,"Lear and Kent, in that king's distresses. Andrugio, like Lear,"
3230,JOHN MARSTON.,"manifests a king-like impatience, a turbulent greatness, an affected"
3231,JOHN MARSTON.,"resignation. The enemies which he enters lists to combat, ""Despair"
3232,JOHN MARSTON.,"and mighty Grief and sharp Impatience,"" and the forces which he"
3233,JOHN MARSTON.,"brings to vanquish them, ""cornets of horse,"" &c., are in the boldest"

3289,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,_A Woman Killed with Kindness_.--Heywood is a sort of _prose_
3290,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,Shakspeare. His scenes are to the full as natural and affecting. But
3291,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"we miss _the poet_, that which in Shakspeare always appears out and"
3292,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"above the surface of _the nature_. Heywood's characters, in this"
3293,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"play, for instance, his country gentlemen, &c., are exactly what we"
3294,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"see, but of the best kind of what we see in life. Shakspeare makes us"
3295,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"believe, while we are among his lovely creations, that they are"

3302,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"is a magnanimity in authorship, as in everything else. His ambition"
3303,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,seems to have been confined to the pleasure of hearing the players
3304,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,speak his lines while he lived. It does not appear that he ever
3305,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,contemplated the possibility of being read by after-ages. What a
3306,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,slender pittance of fame was motive sufficient to the production of
3307,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,"such plays as the English Traveller, the Challenge for Beauty, and"
3308,THOMAS HEYWOOD.,the Woman Killed with Kindness! Posterity is bound to take care that

3317,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"these scenes are filled with. A puritanical obtuseness of sentiment,"
3318,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"a stupid infantile goodness, is creeping among us, instead of the"
3319,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"vigorous passions, and virtues clad in flesh and blood, with which"
3320,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,the old dramatists present us. Those noble and liberal casuists could
3321,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"discern in the differences, the quarrels, the animosities of men, a"
3322,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"beauty and truth of moral feeling, no less than in the everlastingly"
3323,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"inculcated duties of forgiveness and atonement. With us, all is"

3327,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"amiable characters in the play, and find a wonderful sympathy of"
3328,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,disposition between them. We have a common stock of dramatic
3329,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"morality, out of which a writer may be supplied without the trouble"
3330,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,of copying it from originals within his own breast. To know the
3331,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"boundaries of honor, to be judiciously valiant, to have a temperance"

3335,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"that ark of an honest confidence is found to be frail and tottering,"

3337,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,the imaginary strokes of a supposed false imputation had put so keen
3338,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"an edge upon but lately; to do, or to imagine this done, in a feigned"

3340,THOMAS MIDDLETON AND WILLIAM ROWLEY.,"delicacy of perception in questions of right and wrong, than goes to"

3374,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"supposed to have preceded it, this coincidence will not detract much"
3375,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,from the originality of Shakspeare. His witches are distinguished
3376,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,from the witches of Middleton by essential differences. These are
3377,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"creatures to whom man or woman, plotting some dire mischief, might"
3378,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"resort for occasional consultation. Those originate deeds of blood,"
3379,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,and begin bad impulses to men. From the moment that their eyes first
3380,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"meet with Macbeth's, he is spellbound. That meeting sways his"
3381,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,destiny. He can never break the fascination. These witches can hurt
3382,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,the body; those have power over the soul. Hecate in Middleton has a
3383,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"son, a low buffoon: the hags of Shakspeare have neither child of"
3384,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"their own, nor seem to be descended from any parent. They are foul"
3385,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"anomalies, of whom we know not whence they are sprung, nor whether"
3386,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"they have beginning or ending. As they are without human passions, so"
3387,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,they seem to be without human relations. They come with thunder and
3388,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"lightning, and vanish to airy music. This is all we know of them."
3389,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"Except Hecate, they have no _names_; which heightens their"
3390,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"mysteriousness. The names, and some of the properties which the other"
3391,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"author has given to his hags, excite smiles. The Weïrd Sisters are"
3392,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,serious things. Their presence cannot coexist with mirth. But in a
3393,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"lesser degree, the witches of Middleton are fine creations. Their"
3394,THOMAS MIDDLETON.,"power, too, is, in some measure, over the mind. They raise jars,"

3508,JOHN FORD.,analogy between the scenical suffering which we are here
3509,JOHN FORD.,contemplating and the real agonies of that final completion to which
3510,JOHN FORD.,we dare no more than hint a reference. Ford was of the first order of

3513,JOHN FORD.,heart of man; in the actions and sufferings of the greatest minds.

3516,JOHN FORD.,"Annabella, in the play[1] which stands at the head of the modern"
3517,JOHN FORD.,"collection of the works of this author, we discern traces of that"
3518,JOHN FORD.,"fiery particle, which, in the irregular starting from out the road of"

3560,BEN JONSON.,_The Case is Altered_.--The passion for wealth has worn out much of

3562,BEN JONSON.,"money as able to confer a distinct gratification in itself, not"
3563,BEN JONSON.,"considered simply as a symbol of wealth. The old poets, when they"
3564,BEN JONSON.,"introduce a miser, make him address his gold as his mistress; as"
3565,BEN JONSON.,"something to be seen, felt, and hugged; as capable of satisfying two"
3566,BEN JONSON.,"of the senses at least. The substitution of a thin, unsatisfying"
3567,BEN JONSON.,"medium in the place of the good old tangible metal, has made avarice"
3568,BEN JONSON.,"quite a Platonic affection in comparison with the seeing, touching,"
3569,BEN JONSON.,and handling pleasures of the old Chrysophilites. A bank-note can no
3570,BEN JONSON.,"more satisfy the touch of a true sensualist in this passion, than"
3571,BEN JONSON.,Creusa could return her husband's embrace in the shades. See the Cave

3596,BEN JONSON.,the Fourteenth of antiquity and his literati. The whole essence and
3597,BEN JONSON.,secret of that kind of intercourse is contained therein. The

3612,BEN JONSON.,believe effects before we have testimony for their causes. If there
3613,BEN JONSON.,"is no one image which attains the height of the sublime, yet the"
3614,BEN JONSON.,confluence and assemblage of them all produces a result equal to the
3615,BEN JONSON.,grandest poetry. The huge Xerxean army countervails against single
3616,BEN JONSON.,Achilles. Epicure Mammon is the most determined offspring of its

3671,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"Zelmane, nor is the respect due to the princesses at all diminished"

3674,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,meditation could find a harbor. He turned all that he touched into
3675,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,images of honor and virtue. Helena in Shakspeare is a young woman
3676,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,seeking a man in marriage. The ordinary rules of courtship are
3677,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"reversed, the habitual feelings are crossed. Yet with such exquisite"

3679,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"loses her no honor; delicacy dispenses with its laws in her favor,"
3680,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"and nature, in her single case, seems content to suffer a sweet"

3683,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"slighted woman, refused by the man who had once engaged to marry her."
3684,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"Yet it is artfully contrived, that while we pity we respect her, and"
3685,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,she descends without degradation. Such wonders true poetry and
3686,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"passion can do, to confer dignity upon subjects which do not seem"

3689,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.--JOHN FLETCHER.,"she suffers some diminution, some abatement of the full lustre of the"

3716,JOHN FLETCHER.,"sacrifice, that the king of France may not be childless, I have"
3717,JOHN FLETCHER.,"always considered as the finest in all Fletcher, and Ordella to be"
3718,JOHN FLETCHER.,"the most perfect notion of the female heroic character, next to"
3719,JOHN FLETCHER.,"Calantha in the Broken Heart. She is a piece of sainted nature. Yet,"
3720,JOHN FLETCHER.,"noble as the whole passage is, it must be confessed that the manner"
3721,JOHN FLETCHER.,"of it, compared with Shakspeare's finest scenes, is faint and"
3722,JOHN FLETCHER.,"languid. Its motion is circular, not progressive. Each line revolves"
3723,JOHN FLETCHER.,on itself in a sort of separate orbit. They do not join into one
3724,JOHN FLETCHER.,another like a running-hand. Fletcher's ideas moved slow; his
3725,JOHN FLETCHER.,"versification, though sweet, is tedious, it stops at every turn; he"
3726,JOHN FLETCHER.,"lays line upon line, making up one after the other, adding image to"
3727,JOHN FLETCHER.,"image so deliberately, that we see their junctures. Shakspeare"
3728,JOHN FLETCHER.,"mingles everything, runs line into line, embarrasses sentences and"
3729,JOHN FLETCHER.,"metaphors; before one idea has burst its shell, another is hatched"
3730,JOHN FLETCHER.,and clamorous for disclosure. Another striking difference between
3731,JOHN FLETCHER.,Fletcher and Shakspeare is the fondness of the former for unnatural
3732,JOHN FLETCHER.,and violent situations. He seems to have thought that nothing great
3733,JOHN FLETCHER.,could be produced in an ordinary way. The chief incidents in some of
3734,JOHN FLETCHER.,his most admired tragedies show this.[1] Shakspeare had nothing of
3735,JOHN FLETCHER.,"this contortion in his mind, none of that craving after violent"
3736,JOHN FLETCHER.,"situations, and flights of strained and improbable virtue, which I"
3737,JOHN FLETCHER.,think always betrays an imperfect moral sensibility. The wit of
3738,JOHN FLETCHER.,"Fletcher is excellent,[2] like his serious scenes, but there is"
3739,JOHN FLETCHER.,something strained and far-fetched in both. He is too mistrustful of
3740,JOHN FLETCHER.,"Nature, he always goes a little on one side of her.--Shakspeare chose"
3741,JOHN FLETCHER.,"her without a reserve: and had riches, power, understanding, and"
3742,JOHN FLETCHER.,"length of days, with her for a dowry."

3752,JOHN FLETCHER.,"made matter for young dreams, like the loves of Hermia and Lysander."
3753,JOHN FLETCHER.,But a spot is on the face of this Diana. Nothing short of infatuation
3754,JOHN FLETCHER.,"could have driven Fletcher upon mixing with this ""blessedness"" such"
3755,JOHN FLETCHER.,"an ugly deformity as Chloe, the wanton shepherdess! If Chloe was"
3756,JOHN FLETCHER.,"meant to set off Clorin by contrast, Fletcher should have known that"
3757,JOHN FLETCHER.,"such weeds by juxtaposition do not set off, but kill sweet flowers."

4174,LATE MR. BARRY.,"One of the earliest and noblest enjoyments I had when a boy, was in"
4175,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the contemplation of those capital prints by Hogarth, the _Harlot's_"
4176,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and _Rake's Progresses_, which, along with some others, hung upon the"
4177,LATE MR. BARRY.,"walls of a great hall in an old-fashioned house in ----shire, and"
4178,LATE MR. BARRY.,seemed the solitary tenants (with myself) of that antiquated and
4179,LATE MR. BARRY.,life-deserted apartment.
4180,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4181,LATE MR. BARRY.,Recollection of the manner in which those prints used to affect me
4182,LATE MR. BARRY.,"has often made me wonder, when I have heard Hogarth described as a"
4183,LATE MR. BARRY.,"mere comic painter, as one of those whose chief ambition was to"
4184,LATE MR. BARRY.,_raise a laugh_. To deny that there are throughout the prints which I
4185,LATE MR. BARRY.,"have mentioned circumstances introduced of a laughable tendency,"
4186,LATE MR. BARRY.,would be to run counter to the common notions of mankind; but to
4187,LATE MR. BARRY.,suppose that in their _ruling character_ they appeal chiefly to the
4188,LATE MR. BARRY.,"risible faculty, and not first and foremost to the very heart of man,"
4189,LATE MR. BARRY.,"its best and most serious feelings, would be to mistake no less"
4190,LATE MR. BARRY.,grossly their aim and purpose. A set of severer Satires (for they are
4191,LATE MR. BARRY.,"not so much Comedies, which they have been likened to, as they are"
4192,LATE MR. BARRY.,"strong and masculine Satires) less mingled with anything of mere fun,"
4193,LATE MR. BARRY.,"were never written upon paper, or graven upon copper. They resemble"
4194,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Juvenal, or the satiric touches in Timon of Athens."
4195,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4196,LATE MR. BARRY.,"I was pleased with the reply of a gentleman, who being asked which"
4197,LATE MR. BARRY.,"book he esteemed most in his library, answered,--""Shakspeare:"" being"
4198,LATE MR. BARRY.,"asked which he esteemed next best, replied, ""Hogarth."" His graphic"
4199,LATE MR. BARRY.,"representations are indeed books: they have the teeming, fruitful,"
4200,LATE MR. BARRY.,"suggestive meaning of _words_. Other pictures we look at,--his prints"
4201,LATE MR. BARRY.,we read.
4202,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4203,LATE MR. BARRY.,"In pursuance of this parallel, I have sometimes entertained myself"
4204,LATE MR. BARRY.,with comparing the _Timon of Athens_ of Shakespeare (which I have
4205,LATE MR. BARRY.,"just mentioned) and Hogarth's _Rake's Progress_ together. The story,"
4206,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the moral, in both is nearly the same. The wild course of riot and"
4207,LATE MR. BARRY.,"extravagance, ending in the one with driving the Prodigal from the"
4208,LATE MR. BARRY.,"society of men into the solitude of the deserts, and in the other"
4209,LATE MR. BARRY.,with conducting the Rake through his several stages of dissipation
4210,LATE MR. BARRY.,"into the still more complete desolations of the mad-house, in the"
4211,LATE MR. BARRY.,"play and in the picture, are described with almost equal force and"
4212,LATE MR. BARRY.,"nature. The levee of the Rake, which forms the subject of the second"
4213,LATE MR. BARRY.,"plate in the series, is almost a transcript of Timon's levee in the"
4214,LATE MR. BARRY.,"opening scene of that play. We find a dedicating poet, and other"
4215,LATE MR. BARRY.,"similar characters, in both."
4216,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4217,LATE MR. BARRY.,The concluding scene in the _Rake's Progress_ is perhaps superior to
4218,LATE MR. BARRY.,the last scenes of _Timon_. If we seek for something of kindred
4219,LATE MR. BARRY.,"excellence in poetry, it must be in the scenes of Lear's beginning"
4220,LATE MR. BARRY.,"madness, where the King and the Fool and the Tom-o'-Bedlam conspire"
4221,LATE MR. BARRY.,"to produce such a medley of mirth checked by misery, and misery"
4222,LATE MR. BARRY.,"rebuked by mirth; where the society of those ""strange bedfellows"""
4223,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which misfortunes have brought Lear acquainted with, so finely sets"
4224,LATE MR. BARRY.,forth the destitute state of the monarch; while the lunatic bans of
4225,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the one, and the disjointed sayings and wild but pregnant allusions"
4226,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of the other, so wonderfully sympathize with that confusion, which"
4227,LATE MR. BARRY.,"they seem to assist in the production of, in the senses of that"
4228,LATE MR. BARRY.,"""child-changed father."""
4229,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4230,LATE MR. BARRY.,"In the scene in Bedlam, which terminates the _Rake's Progress_, we"
4231,LATE MR. BARRY.,find the same assortment of the ludicrous with the terrible. Here is
4232,LATE MR. BARRY.,"desperate madness, the overturning of originally strong thinking"
4233,LATE MR. BARRY.,"faculties, at which we shudder, as we contemplate the duration and"
4234,LATE MR. BARRY.,pressure of affliction which it must have asked to destroy such a
4235,LATE MR. BARRY.,"building;--and here is the gradual hurtless lapse into idiocy, of"
4236,LATE MR. BARRY.,"faculties, which at their best of times never having been strong, we"
4237,LATE MR. BARRY.,look upon the consummation of their decay with no more of pity than
4238,LATE MR. BARRY.,"is consistent with a smile. The mad tailor, the poor driveller that"
4239,LATE MR. BARRY.,has gone out of his wits (and truly he appears to have had no great
4240,LATE MR. BARRY.,journey to go to get past their confines) for the love of _Charming
4241,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Betty Careless_,--. these half-laughable, scarce-pitiable objects,"
4242,LATE MR. BARRY.,take off from the horror which the principal figure would of itself
4243,LATE MR. BARRY.,"raise, at the same time that they assist the feeling of the scene by"
4244,LATE MR. BARRY.,contributing to the general notion of its subject:--
4245,LATE MR. BARRY.,

4258,LATE MR. BARRY.,[Footnote 1: Lines inscribed under the plate]
4259,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4260,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Is it carrying the spirit of comparison to excess to remark, that in"

4262,LATE MR. BARRY.,"sad decay, there is something analogous to Kent, or Caius, as he"
4263,LATE MR. BARRY.,"delights rather to be called, in _Lear_,--the noblest pattern of"
4264,LATE MR. BARRY.,"virtue which even Shakspeare has conceived,--who follows his royal"
4265,LATE MR. BARRY.,"master in banishment, that had pronounced _his_ banishment, and"
4266,LATE MR. BARRY.,"forgetful at once of his wrongs and dignities, taking on himself the"
4267,LATE MR. BARRY.,"disguise of a menial, retains his fidelity to the figure, his loyalty"
4268,LATE MR. BARRY.,"to the carcass, the shadow, the shell, and empty husk of Lear?"
4269,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4270,LATE MR. BARRY.,"In the perusal of a book, or of a picture, much of the impression"
4271,LATE MR. BARRY.,which we receive depends upon the habit of mind which we bring with
4272,LATE MR. BARRY.,"us to such perusal. The same circumstance may make one person laugh,"
4273,LATE MR. BARRY.,which shall render another very serious; or in the same person the
4274,LATE MR. BARRY.,first impression may be corrected by after-thought. The misemployed
4275,LATE MR. BARRY.,"incongruous characters at the _Harlot's Funeral_, on a superficial"
4276,LATE MR. BARRY.,"inspection, provoke to laughter; but when we have sacrificed the"
4277,LATE MR. BARRY.,"first emotion to levity, a very different frame of mind succeeds, or"
4278,LATE MR. BARRY.,the painter has lost half his purpose. I never look at that wonderful
4279,LATE MR. BARRY.,"assemblage of depraved beings, who, without a grain of reverence or"
4280,LATE MR. BARRY.,"pity in their perverted minds, are performing the sacred exteriors of"
4281,LATE MR. BARRY.,"duty to the relics of their departed partner in folly, but I am as"
4282,LATE MR. BARRY.,"much moved to sympathy from the very want of it in them, as I should"
4283,LATE MR. BARRY.,be by the finest representation of a virtuous death-bed surrounded by
4284,LATE MR. BARRY.,"real mourners, pious children, weeping friends,--perhaps more by the"
4285,LATE MR. BARRY.,"very contrast. What reflections does it not awake, of the dreadful"
4286,LATE MR. BARRY.,"heartless state in which the creature (a female too) must have lived,"
4287,LATE MR. BARRY.,who in death wants the accompaniment of one genuine tear. That wretch
4288,LATE MR. BARRY.,who is removing the lid of the coffin to gaze upon the corpse with a
4289,LATE MR. BARRY.,face which indicates a perfect negation of all goodness or
4290,LATE MR. BARRY.,womanhood--the hypocrite parson and his demure partner--all the
4291,LATE MR. BARRY.,fiendish group--to a thoughtful mind present a moral emblem more
4292,LATE MR. BARRY.,affecting than if the poor friendless carcass had been depicted as
4293,LATE MR. BARRY.,"thrown out to the woods, where wolves had assisted at its obsequies,"
4294,LATE MR. BARRY.,itself furnishing forth its own funeral banquet.
4295,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4296,LATE MR. BARRY.,It is easy to laugh at such incongruities as are met together in this
4297,LATE MR. BARRY.,"picture,--incongruous objects being of the very essence of"
4298,LATE MR. BARRY.,"laughter,--but surely the laugh is far different in its kind from"
4299,LATE MR. BARRY.,that thoughtless species to which we are moved by mere farce and
4300,LATE MR. BARRY.,"grotesque. We laugh when Ferdinand Count Fathom, at the first sight"
4301,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of the white cliffs of Britain, feels his heart yearn with filial"
4302,LATE MR. BARRY.,"fondness towards the land of his progenitors, which he is coming to"
4303,LATE MR. BARRY.,"fleece and plunder,--we smile at the exquisite irony of the"
4304,LATE MR. BARRY.,"passage,--but if we are not led on by such passages to some more"
4305,LATE MR. BARRY.,"salutary feeling than laughter, we are very negligent perusers of"
4306,LATE MR. BARRY.,them in book or picture.
4307,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4308,LATE MR. BARRY.,It is the fashion with those who cry up the great Historical School
4309,LATE MR. BARRY.,"in this country, at the head of which Sir Joshua Reynolds is placed,"
4310,LATE MR. BARRY.,"to exclude Hogarth from that school, as an artist of an inferior and"
4311,LATE MR. BARRY.,vulgar class. Those persons seem to me to confound the painting of
4312,LATE MR. BARRY.,subjects in common or vulgar life with the being a vulgar artist. The
4313,LATE MR. BARRY.,quantity of thought which Hogarth crowds into every picture would
4314,LATE MR. BARRY.,alone _unvulgarize_ every subject which he might choose. Let us take
4315,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the lowest of his subjects, the print called _Gin Lane_. Here is"
4316,LATE MR. BARRY.,"plenty of poverty, and low stuff to disgust upon a superficial view;"
4317,LATE MR. BARRY.,and accordingly a cold spectator feels himself immediately disgusted
4318,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and repelled. I have seen many turn away from it, not being able to"
4319,LATE MR. BARRY.,bear it. The same persons would perhaps have looked with great
4320,LATE MR. BARRY.,complacency upon Poussin's celebrated picture of the _Plague at
4321,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Athens_[1] Disease and Death and bewildering Terror, in _Athenian"
4322,LATE MR. BARRY.,"garments_, are endurable, and come, as the delicate critics express"
4323,LATE MR. BARRY.,"it, within the ""limits of pleasurable sensation."" But the scenes of"
4324,LATE MR. BARRY.,"their own St. Giles's, delineated by their own countryman, are too"
4325,LATE MR. BARRY.,shocking to think of. Yet if we could abstract our minds from the
4326,LATE MR. BARRY.,"fascinating colors of the picture, and forget the coarse execution"
4327,LATE MR. BARRY.,"(in some respects) of the print, intended as it was to be a cheap"
4328,LATE MR. BARRY.,"plate, accessible to the poorer sort of people, for whose instruction"
4329,LATE MR. BARRY.,"it was done, I think we could have no hesitation in conferring the"
4330,LATE MR. BARRY.,"palm of superior genius upon Hogarth, comparing this work of his with"
4331,LATE MR. BARRY.,Poussin's picture. There is more of imagination in it--that power
4332,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which draws all things to one,--which makes things animate and"
4333,LATE MR. BARRY.,"inanimate, beings with their attributes, subjects, and their"
4334,LATE MR. BARRY.,"accessories, take one color and serve to one effect. Everything in"
4335,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the print, to use a vulgar expression, _tells_. Every part is full of"
4336,LATE MR. BARRY.,"""strange images of death."" It is perfectly amazing and astounding to"
4337,LATE MR. BARRY.,"look at. Not only the two prominent figures, the woman and the"
4338,LATE MR. BARRY.,"half-dead man, which are as terrible as anything which Michael Angelo"
4339,LATE MR. BARRY.,"ever drew, but everything else in the print, contributes to bewilder"
4340,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and stupefy,--the very houses, as I heard a friend of mine express"
4341,LATE MR. BARRY.,"it, tumbling all about in various directions, seem drunk--seem"
4342,LATE MR. BARRY.,absolutely reeling from the effect of that diabolical spirit of
4343,LATE MR. BARRY.,frenzy which goes forth over the whole composition. To show the
4344,LATE MR. BARRY.,"poetical and almost prophetical conception in the artist, one little"
4345,LATE MR. BARRY.,"circumstance may serve. Not content with the dying and dead figures,"
4346,LATE MR. BARRY.,which he has strewed in profusion over the proper scene of the
4347,LATE MR. BARRY.,"action, he shows you what (of a kindred nature) is passing beyond it."
4348,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Close by the shell, in which, by direction of the parish beadle, a"
4349,LATE MR. BARRY.,"man is depositing his wife, is an old wall, which, partaking of the"
4350,LATE MR. BARRY.,"universal decay around it, is tumbling to pieces. Through a gap in"
4351,LATE MR. BARRY.,"this wall are seen three figures, which appear to make a part in some"
4352,LATE MR. BARRY.,"funeral procession which is passing by on the other side of the wall,"
4353,LATE MR. BARRY.,out of the sphere of the composition. This extending of the interest
4354,LATE MR. BARRY.,beyond the bounds of the subject could only have been conceived by a
4355,LATE MR. BARRY.,"great genius. Shakspeare, in his description of the painting of the"
4356,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Trojan War, in his _Tarquin and Lucrece_, has introduced a similar"
4357,LATE MR. BARRY.,"device, where the painter made a part stand for the whole:--"
4358,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4359,LATE MR. BARRY.,"""For much imaginary work was there,"
4360,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,"
4361,LATE MR. BARRY.,"That for Achilles' image stood his spear,"
4362,LATE MR. BARRY.,Grip'd in an armed hand; himself behind
4363,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:"
4364,LATE MR. BARRY.,"A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,"
4365,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Stood for the whole to be imagined."""
4366,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4367,LATE MR. BARRY.,"[Footnote 1: At the late Mr. Hope's, in Cavendish Square]"
4368,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4369,LATE MR. BARRY.,"This he well calls _imaginary work_, where the spectator must meet"
4370,LATE MR. BARRY.,the artist in his conceptions half way; and it is peculiar to the
4371,LATE MR. BARRY.,confidence of high genius alone to trust so much to spectators or
4372,LATE MR. BARRY.,"readers. Lesser artists show everything distinct and full, as they"
4373,LATE MR. BARRY.,require an object to be made out to themselves before they can
4374,LATE MR. BARRY.,comprehend it.
4375,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4376,LATE MR. BARRY.,When I think of the power displayed in this (I will not hesitate to
4377,LATE MR. BARRY.,"say) sublime print, it seems to me the extreme narrowness of system"
4378,LATE MR. BARRY.,"alone, and of that rage for classification, by which, in matters of"
4379,LATE MR. BARRY.,"taste at least, we are perpetually perplexing, instead of arranging,"
4380,LATE MR. BARRY.,"our ideas, that would make us concede to the work of Poussin above"
4381,LATE MR. BARRY.,"mentioned, and deny to this of Hogarth, the name of a grand serious"
4382,LATE MR. BARRY.,composition.
4383,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4384,LATE MR. BARRY.,We are forever deceiving ourselves with names and theories. We call
4385,LATE MR. BARRY.,"one man a great historical painter, because he has taken for his"
4386,LATE MR. BARRY.,"subjects kings or great men, or transactions over which time has"
4387,LATE MR. BARRY.,"thrown a grandeur. We term another the painter of common life, and"
4388,LATE MR. BARRY.,"set him down in our minds for an artist of an inferior class, without"
4389,LATE MR. BARRY.,reflecting whether the quantity of thought shown by the latter may
4390,LATE MR. BARRY.,not much more than level the distinction which their mere choice of
4391,LATE MR. BARRY.,"subjects may seem to place between them; or whether, in fact, from"
4392,LATE MR. BARRY.,that very common life a great artist may not extract as deep an
4393,LATE MR. BARRY.,interest as another man from that which we are pleased to call
4394,LATE MR. BARRY.,history.
4395,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4396,LATE MR. BARRY.,I entertain the highest respect for the talents and virtues of
4397,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Reynolds, but I do not like that his reputation should overshadow and"
4398,LATE MR. BARRY.,"stifle the merits of such a man as Hogarth, nor that to mere names"
4399,LATE MR. BARRY.,and classifications we should be content to sacrifice one of the
4400,LATE MR. BARRY.,greatest ornaments of England.
4401,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4402,LATE MR. BARRY.,"I would ask the most enthusiastic admirer of Reynolds, whether in the"
4403,LATE MR. BARRY.,"countenances of his _Staring_ and _Grinning Despair_, which he has"
4404,LATE MR. BARRY.,"given us for the faces of Ugolino and dying Beaufort, there be"
4405,LATE MR. BARRY.,anything comparable to the expression which Hogarth has put into the
4406,LATE MR. BARRY.,face of his broken-down rake in the last plate but one of the _Rake's
4407,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Progress_,[1] where a letter from the manager is brought to him to"
4408,LATE MR. BARRY.,"say that his play ""will not do?"" Here all is easy, natural,"
4409,LATE MR. BARRY.,"undistorted, but withal what a mass of woe is here accumulated!--the"
4410,LATE MR. BARRY.,long history of a misspent life is compressed into the countenance as
4411,LATE MR. BARRY.,plainly as the series of plates before had told it; here is no
4412,LATE MR. BARRY.,"attempt at Gorgonian looks, which are to freeze the beholder--no"
4413,LATE MR. BARRY.,"grinning at the antique bedposts--no face-making, or consciousness of"
4414,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the presence of spectators in or out of the picture, but grief kept"
4415,LATE MR. BARRY.,"to a man's self, a face retiring from notice with the shame which"
4416,LATE MR. BARRY.,"great anguish sometimes brings with it,--a final leave taken of"
4417,LATE MR. BARRY.,"hope,--the coming on of vacancy and stupefaction,--a beginning"
4418,LATE MR. BARRY.,alienation of mind looking like tranquillity. Here is matter for the
4419,LATE MR. BARRY.,"mind of the beholder to feed on for the hour together,--matter to"
4420,LATE MR. BARRY.,feed and fertilize the mind. It is too real to admit one thought
4421,LATE MR. BARRY.,about the power of the artist who did it. When we compare the
4422,LATE MR. BARRY.,"expression in subjects which so fairly admit of comparison, and find"
4423,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the superiority so clearly to remain with Hogarth, shall the mere"
4424,LATE MR. BARRY.,"contemptible difference of the scene of it being laid, in the one"
4425,LATE MR. BARRY.,"case, in our Fleet or King's Bench Prison, and, in the other, in the"
4426,LATE MR. BARRY.,"State Prison of Pisa, or the bedroom of a cardinal,--or that the"
4427,LATE MR. BARRY.,"subject of the one has never been authenticated, and the other is"
4428,LATE MR. BARRY.,"matter of history,--so weigh down the real points, of the comparison,"
4429,LATE MR. BARRY.,as to induce us to rank the artist who has chosen the one scene or
4430,LATE MR. BARRY.,subject (though confessedly inferior in that which constitutes the
4431,LATE MR. BARRY.,soul of his art) in a class from which we exclude the better genius
4432,LATE MR. BARRY.,(who has happened to make choice of the other) with something like
4433,LATE MR. BARRY.,disgrace?[2]
4434,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4435,LATE MR. BARRY.,[Footnote 1: The first perhaps in all Hogarth for serious
4436,LATE MR. BARRY.,"expression.  That which comes next to it, I think, is the jaded"
4437,LATE MR. BARRY.,morning countenance of the debauchee in the second plate of the
4438,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Marriage Alamode_, which lectures on the vanity of pleasure as"
4439,LATE MR. BARRY.,audibly as anything in Ecclesiastes.]
4440,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4441,LATE MR. BARRY.,"[Footnote 2: Sir Joshua Reynolds, somewhere in his Lectures, speaks"
4442,LATE MR. BARRY.,of the _presumption_ of Hogarth in attempting the grand style in
4443,LATE MR. BARRY.,"painting, by which he means his choice of certain Scripture subjects."
4444,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Hogarth's excursions into Holy Land were not very numerous, but what"
4445,LATE MR. BARRY.,"he has left us in this kind have at least this merit, that they have"
4446,LATE MR. BARRY.,"expression of _some sort or other_ in them,--the _Child Moses before"
4447,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Pharaoh's Daughter_, for instance: which is more than can be said of"
4448,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Sir Joshua Reynolds's _Repose in Egypt_, painted for Macklin's Bible,"
4449,LATE MR. BARRY.,"where for a Madonna he has substituted a sleepy, insensible,"
4450,LATE MR. BARRY.,"unmotherly girl, one so little worthy to have been selected as the"
4451,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Mother of the Saviour, that she seems to have neither heart nor"
4452,LATE MR. BARRY.,feeling to entitle her to become a mother at all. But indeed the race
4453,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of Virgin Mary painters seems to have been cut up, root and branch,"
4454,LATE MR. BARRY.,at the Reformation. Our artists are too good Protestants to give life
4455,LATE MR. BARRY.,to that admirable commixture of maternal tenderness with reverential
4456,LATE MR. BARRY.,"awe and wonder approaching to worship, with which the Virgin Mothers"
4457,LATE MR. BARRY.,of L. da Vinci and Raphael (themselves by their divine countenances
4458,LATE MR. BARRY.,inviting men to worship) contemplate the union of the two natures in
4459,LATE MR. BARRY.,the person of their Heaven-born Infant.]
4460,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4461,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_The Boys under Demoniacal Possession_ of Raphael and Domenichino, by"
4462,LATE MR. BARRY.,what law of classification are we bound to assign them to belong to
4463,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the great style in painting, and to degrade into an inferior class"
4464,LATE MR. BARRY.,the Rake of Hogarth when he is the Madman in the Bedlam scene? I am
4465,LATE MR. BARRY.,sure he is far more impressive than either. It is a face which no one
4466,LATE MR. BARRY.,that has seen can easily forget. There is the stretch of human
4467,LATE MR. BARRY.,"suffering to the utmost endurance, severe bodily pain brought on by"
4468,LATE MR. BARRY.,"strong mental agony, the frightful, obstinate laugh of madness,--yet"
4469,LATE MR. BARRY.,"all so unforced and natural, that those who never were witness to"
4470,LATE MR. BARRY.,"madness in real life, think they see nothing but what is familiar to"
4471,LATE MR. BARRY.,"them in this face. Here are no tricks of distortion, nothing but the"
4472,LATE MR. BARRY.,"natural face of agony. This is high tragic painting, and we might as"
4473,LATE MR. BARRY.,"well deny to Shakspeare the honors of a great tragedian, because he"
4474,LATE MR. BARRY.,has interwoven scenes of mirth with the serious business of his
4475,LATE MR. BARRY.,"plays, as refuse to Hogarth the same praise for the two concluding"
4476,LATE MR. BARRY.,"scenes of the _Rake's Progress_, because of the Comic Lunatics[1]"
4477,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which he has thrown into the one, or the Alchymist that he has"
4478,LATE MR. BARRY.,"introduced in the other, who is paddling in the coals of his furnace,"
4479,LATE MR. BARRY.,keeping alive the flames of vain hope within the very walls of the
4480,LATE MR. BARRY.,"prison to which the vanity has conducted him, which have taught the"
4481,LATE MR. BARRY.,darker lesson of extinguished hope to the desponding figure who is
4482,LATE MR. BARRY.,the principal person of the scene.
4483,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4484,LATE MR. BARRY.,[Footnote 1:
4485,LATE MR. BARRY.,"""There are of madmen, as there are of tame,"
4486,LATE MR. BARRY.,All humor'd not alike. We have here some
4487,LATE MR. BARRY.,"So apish and fantastic, play with a feather;"
4488,LATE MR. BARRY.,And though 'twould grieve a soul to see God's image
4489,LATE MR. BARRY.,"So blemish'd and defac'd, yet do they act"

4491,LATE MR. BARRY.,"That, spite of sorrow, they will make you smile."

4494,LATE MR. BARRY.,_Honest Whore_.]
4495,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4496,LATE MR. BARRY.,It is the force of these kindly admixtures which assimilates the
4497,LATE MR. BARRY.,"scenes of Hogarth and of Shakspeare to the drama of real life, where"
4498,LATE MR. BARRY.,no such thing as pure tragedy is to be found; but merriment and
4499,LATE MR. BARRY.,"infelicity, ponderous crime and feather-light vanity, like twiformed"
4500,LATE MR. BARRY.,"births, disagreeing complexions of one intertexture, perpetually"
4501,LATE MR. BARRY.,unite to show forth motley spectacles to the world. Then it is that
4502,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the poet or painter shows his art, when in the selection of these"
4503,LATE MR. BARRY.,"comic adjuncts he chooses such circumstances as shall relieve,"
4504,LATE MR. BARRY.,"contrast with, or fall into, without forming a violent opposition to"
4505,LATE MR. BARRY.,"his principal object. Who sees not that the Grave-digger in _Hamlet_,"
4506,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the Fool in _Lear_, have a kind of correspondency to, and fall in"
4507,LATE MR. BARRY.,"with, the subjects which they seem to interrupt: while the comic"
4508,LATE MR. BARRY.,"stuff in _Venice Preserved_, and the doggerel nonsense of the Cook"
4509,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and his poisoning associates in the _Rollo_ of Beaumont and Fletcher,"
4510,LATE MR. BARRY.,"are pure, irrelevant, impertinent discords,--as bad as the"
4511,LATE MR. BARRY.,quarrelling dog and cat under the table of the _Lord and the
4512,LATE MR. BARRY.,Disciples at Emmaus_ of Titian?
4513,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4514,LATE MR. BARRY.,Not to tire the reader with perpetual reference to prints which he
4515,LATE MR. BARRY.,"may not be fortunate enough to possess, it may be sufficient to"
4516,LATE MR. BARRY.,"remark, that the same tragic cast of expression and incident, blended"
4517,LATE MR. BARRY.,"in some instances with a greater alloy of comedy, characterizes his"
4518,LATE MR. BARRY.,"other great work, the _Marriage Alamode_, as well as those less"
4519,LATE MR. BARRY.,"elaborate exertions of his genius, the prints called _Industry_ and"
4520,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Idleness_, _the Distrest Poet_, &c., forming, with the _Harlot's_"
4521,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and _Rake's Progresses_, the most considerable, if not the largest"
4522,LATE MR. BARRY.,"class of his productions,--enough surely to rescue Hogarth from the"
4523,LATE MR. BARRY.,"imputation of being a mere buffoon, or one whose general aim was only"
4524,LATE MR. BARRY.,to _shake the sides_.
4525,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4526,LATE MR. BARRY.,"There remains a very numerous class of his performances, the object"
4527,LATE MR. BARRY.,of which must be confessed to be principally comic. But in all of
4528,LATE MR. BARRY.,them will be found something to distinguish them from the droll
4529,LATE MR. BARRY.,"productions of Bunbury and others. They have this difference, that we"
4530,LATE MR. BARRY.,"do not merely laugh at, we are led into long trains of reflection by"
4531,LATE MR. BARRY.,them. In this respect they resemble the characters of Chaucer's
4532,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Pilgrims_, which have strokes of humor in them enough to designate"
4533,LATE MR. BARRY.,"them for the most part as comic, but our strongest feeling still is"
4534,LATE MR. BARRY.,"wonder at the comprehensiveness of genius which could crowd, as poet"
4535,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and painter have done, into one small canvas so many diverse yet"
4536,LATE MR. BARRY.,cooperating materials.
4537,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4538,LATE MR. BARRY.,"The faces of Hogarth have not a mere momentary interest, as in"
4539,LATE MR. BARRY.,"caricatures, or those grotesque physiognomies which we sometimes"
4540,LATE MR. BARRY.,"catch a glance of in the street, and, struck with their whimsicality,"
4541,LATE MR. BARRY.,wish for a pencil and the power to sketch them down; and forget them
4542,LATE MR. BARRY.,"again as rapidly,--but they are permanent abiding ideas. Not the"
4543,LATE MR. BARRY.,"sports of nature, but her necessary eternal classes. We feel that we"
4544,LATE MR. BARRY.,"cannot part with any of them, lest a link should be broken."
4545,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4546,LATE MR. BARRY.,"It is worthy of observation, that he has seldom drawn a mean or"
4547,LATE MR. BARRY.,insignificant countenance.[1] Hogarth's mind was eminently
4548,LATE MR. BARRY.,"reflective; and, as it has been well observed of Shakspeare, that he"
4549,LATE MR. BARRY.,has transfused his own poetical character into the persons of his
4550,LATE MR. BARRY.,drama (they are all more or less _poets_) Hogarth has impressed a
4551,LATE MR. BARRY.,_thinking character_ upon the persons of his canvas. This remark must
4552,LATE MR. BARRY.,not be taken universally. The exquisite idiotism of the little
4553,LATE MR. BARRY.,gentleman in the bag and sword beating his drum in the print of the
4554,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Enraged Musician_, would of itself rise up against so sweeping an"
4555,LATE MR. BARRY.,assertion. But I think it will be found to be true of the generality
4556,LATE MR. BARRY.,of his countenances. The knife-grinder and Jew flute-player in the
4557,LATE MR. BARRY.,"plate just mentioned, may serve as instances instead of a thousand."
4558,LATE MR. BARRY.,"They have intense thinking faces, though the purpose to which they"
4559,LATE MR. BARRY.,are subservient by no means required it; but indeed it seems as if it
4560,LATE MR. BARRY.,was painful to Hogarth to contemplate mere vacancy or insignificance.
4561,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4562,LATE MR. BARRY.,"[Footnote 1: If there are any of that description, they are in his"
4563,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Strolling Players_, a print which has been cried up by Lord Orford"
4564,LATE MR. BARRY.,"as the richest of his productions, and it may be, for what I know, in"
4565,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the mere lumber, the properties, and dead furniture of the scene, but"
4566,LATE MR. BARRY.,in living character and expression it is (for Hogarth) lamentably
4567,LATE MR. BARRY.,poor and wanting; it is perhaps the only one of his performances at
4568,LATE MR. BARRY.,which we have a right to feel disgusted.]
4569,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4570,LATE MR. BARRY.,This reflection of the artist's own intellect from the faces of his
4571,LATE MR. BARRY.,"characters, is one reason why the works of Hogarth, so much more than"
4572,LATE MR. BARRY.,"those of any other artist, are objects of meditation. Our"
4573,LATE MR. BARRY.,intellectual natures love the mirror which gives them back their own
4574,LATE MR. BARRY.,likenesses. The mental eye will not bend long with delight upon
4575,LATE MR. BARRY.,vacancy.
4576,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4577,LATE MR. BARRY.,Another line of eternal separation between Hogarth and the common
4578,LATE MR. BARRY.,"painters of droll or burlesque subjects, with whom he is often"
4579,LATE MR. BARRY.,"confounded, is the sense of beauty, which in the most unpromising"
4580,LATE MR. BARRY.,"subjects seems never wholly to have deserted him. ""Hogarth himself,"""
4581,LATE MR. BARRY.,"says Mr. Coleridge,[1] from whom I have borrowed this observation,"
4582,LATE MR. BARRY.,"speaking of a scene which took place at Ratzeburg, ""never drew a more"
4583,LATE MR. BARRY.,"ludicrous distortion, both of attitude and physiognomy, than this"
4584,LATE MR. BARRY.,effect occasioned: nor was there wanting beside it one of those
4585,LATE MR. BARRY.,"beautiful female faces which the same Hogarth, _in whom the satirist"
4586,LATE MR. BARRY.,never extinguished that love of beauty which belonged to him as a
4587,LATE MR. BARRY.,"poet_, so often and so gladly introduces as the central figure in a"
4588,LATE MR. BARRY.,"crowd of humorous deformities, which figure (such is the power of"
4589,LATE MR. BARRY.,true genius) neither acts nor is meant to act as a contrast; but
4590,LATE MR. BARRY.,diffuses through all and over each of the group a spirit of
4591,LATE MR. BARRY.,reconciliation and human kindness; and even when the attention is no
4592,LATE MR. BARRY.,"longer consciously directed to the cause of this feeling, still"
4593,LATE MR. BARRY.,blends its tenderness with our laughter: and _thus prevents the
4594,LATE MR. BARRY.,"instructive merriment at the whims of nature, or the foibles or"
4595,LATE MR. BARRY.,"humors of our fellow-men, from degenerating into the heart-poison of"
4596,LATE MR. BARRY.,"contempt or hatred_."" To the beautiful females in Hogarth, which Mr."
4597,LATE MR. BARRY.,"C. has pointed out, might be added, the frequent introduction of"
4598,LATE MR. BARRY.,children (which Hogarth seems to have taken a particular delight in)
4599,LATE MR. BARRY.,into his pieces. They have a singular effect in giving tranquillity
4600,LATE MR. BARRY.,and a portion of their own innocence to the subject. The baby riding
4601,LATE MR. BARRY.,"in its mother's lap in the _March to Finchley_, (its careless"
4602,LATE MR. BARRY.,innocent face placed directly behind the intriguing time-furrowed
4603,LATE MR. BARRY.,"countenance of the treason-plotting French priest,) perfectly sobers"
4604,LATE MR. BARRY.,the whole of that tumultuous scene. The boy mourner winding up his
4605,LATE MR. BARRY.,top with so much unpretending insensibility in the plate of the
4606,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Harlot's Funeral_, (the only thing in that assembly that is not a"
4607,LATE MR. BARRY.,"hypocrite,) quiets and soothes the mind that has been disturbed at the"
4608,LATE MR. BARRY.,sight of so much depraved man and woman kind.
4609,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4610,LATE MR. BARRY.,"[Footnote 1: _The Friend_, No. XVI.]"
4611,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4612,LATE MR. BARRY.,"I had written thus far, when I met with a passage in the writings of"
4613,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the late Mr. Barry, which, as it falls in with the _vulgar notion_"
4614,LATE MR. BARRY.,"respecting Hogarth, which this Essay has been employed in combating,"
4615,LATE MR. BARRY.,"I shall take the liberty to transcribe, with such remarks as may"
4616,LATE MR. BARRY.,suggest themselves to me in the transcription; referring the reader
4617,LATE MR. BARRY.,for a full answer to that which has gone before.
4618,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4619,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4620,LATE MR. BARRY.,"""Notwithstanding Hogarth's merit does undoubtedly entitle him"
4621,LATE MR. BARRY.,"to an honorable place among the artists, and that his little"
4622,LATE MR. BARRY.,"compositions, considered as so many dramatic representations,"
4623,LATE MR. BARRY.,"abounding with humor, character, and extensive observations on"
4624,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the various incidents of low, faulty, and vicious life, are"
4625,LATE MR. BARRY.,"very ingeniously brought together, and frequently tell their"
4626,LATE MR. BARRY.,own story with more facility than is often found in many of
4627,LATE MR. BARRY.,the elevated and more noble inventions of Raphael and other
4628,LATE MR. BARRY.,"great men; yet it must be honestly confessed, that in what is"
4629,LATE MR. BARRY.,"called knowledge of the figure, foreigners have justly"
4630,LATE MR. BARRY.,"observed, that Hogarth is often so raw and unformed, as hardly"
4631,LATE MR. BARRY.,to deserve the name of an artist. But this capital defect is
4632,LATE MR. BARRY.,"not often perceivable, as examples of the naked and of"
4633,LATE MR. BARRY.,"elevated nature but rarely occur in his subjects, which are"
4634,LATE MR. BARRY.,for the most part filled with characters that in their nature
4635,LATE MR. BARRY.,"tend to deformity; besides his figures are small, and the"
4636,LATE MR. BARRY.,"jonctures, and other difficulties of drawing that might occur"
4637,LATE MR. BARRY.,"in their limbs, are artfully concealed with their clothes,"
4638,LATE MR. BARRY.,"rags, &c. But what would atone for all his defects, even if"
4639,LATE MR. BARRY.,"they were twice told, is his admirable fund of invention, ever"
4640,LATE MR. BARRY.,"inexhaustible in its resources; and his satire, which is"
4641,LATE MR. BARRY.,"always sharp and pertinent, and often highly moral, was"
4642,LATE MR. BARRY.,"(except in a few instances, where he weakly and meanly"
4643,LATE MR. BARRY.,suffered his integrity to give way to his envy) seldom or
4644,LATE MR. BARRY.,never employed in a dishonest or unmanly way. Hogarth has been
4645,LATE MR. BARRY.,"often imitated in his satirical vein, sometimes in his"
4646,LATE MR. BARRY.,humorous: but very few have attempted to rival him in his
4647,LATE MR. BARRY.,moral walk. The line of art pursued by my very ingenious
4648,LATE MR. BARRY.,"predecessor and brother Academician, Mr. Penny, is quite"
4649,LATE MR. BARRY.,"distinct from that of Hogarth, and is of a much more delicate"
4650,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and superior relish; he attempts the heart, and reaches it,"
4651,LATE MR. BARRY.,whilst Hogarth's general aim is only to shake the sides; in
4652,LATE MR. BARRY.,"other respects no comparison can be thought of, as Mr. Penny"
4653,LATE MR. BARRY.,has all that knowledge of the figure and academical skill
4654,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which the other wanted. As to Mr. Bunbury, who had so happily"
4655,LATE MR. BARRY.,"succeeded in the vein of humor and caricatura, he has for some"
4656,LATE MR. BARRY.,"time past altogether relinquished it, for the more amiable"
4657,LATE MR. BARRY.,"pursuit of beautiful nature: this, indeed, is not to be"

4659,LATE MR. BARRY.,so admirable an exemplar of the most finished grace and beauty
4660,LATE MR. BARRY.,continually at his elbow. But (to say all that occurs to me on
4661,LATE MR. BARRY.,"this subject) perhaps it may be reasonably doubted, whether"
4662,LATE MR. BARRY.,the being much conversant with Hogarth's method of exposing
4663,LATE MR. BARRY.,"meanness, deformity, and vice, in many of his works, is not"
4664,LATE MR. BARRY.,"rather a dangerous, or, at least, a worthless pursuit; which,"
4665,LATE MR. BARRY.,if it does not find a false relish and a love of and search
4666,LATE MR. BARRY.,"after satire and buffoonery in the spectator, is at least not"
4667,LATE MR. BARRY.,unlikely to give him one. Life is short; and the little
4668,LATE MR. BARRY.,leisure of it is much better laid out upon that species of art
4669,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which is employed about the amiable and the admirable, as it"
4670,LATE MR. BARRY.,is more likely to be attended with better and nobler
4671,LATE MR. BARRY.,consequences to ourselves. These two pursuits in art may be
4672,LATE MR. BARRY.,compared with two sets of people with whom we might associate;
4673,LATE MR. BARRY.,"if we give ourselves up to the Footes, the Kenricks, &c. we"
4674,LATE MR. BARRY.,shall be continually busied and paddling in whatever is
4675,LATE MR. BARRY.,"ridiculous, faulty, and vicious in life; whereas there are"
4676,LATE MR. BARRY.,those to be found with whom we should be in the constant
4677,LATE MR. BARRY.,pursuit and study of all that gives a value and a dignity to

4688,LATE MR. BARRY.,It is a secret well known to the professors of the art and mystery of
4689,LATE MR. BARRY.,"criticism, to insist upon what they do not find in a man's works, and"
4690,LATE MR. BARRY.,to pass over in silence what they do. That Hogarth did not draw the
4691,LATE MR. BARRY.,"naked figure so well as Michael Angelo might be allowed, especially"
4692,LATE MR. BARRY.,"as ""examples of the naked,"" as Mr. Barry acknowledges, ""rarely (he"
4693,LATE MR. BARRY.,"might almost have said never) occur in his subjects;"" and that his"
4694,LATE MR. BARRY.,figures under their draperies do not discover all the fine graces of
4695,LATE MR. BARRY.,"an Antinoüs or an Apollo, may be conceded likewise; perhaps it was"
4696,LATE MR. BARRY.,more suitable to his purpose to represent the average forms of
4697,LATE MR. BARRY.,mankind in the mediocrity (as Mr. Burke expresses it) of the age in
4698,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which he lived: but that his figures in general, and in his best"
4699,LATE MR. BARRY.,"subjects, are so glaringly incorrect as is here insinuated, I dare"
4700,LATE MR. BARRY.,trust my own eye so far as positively to deny the fact. And there is
4701,LATE MR. BARRY.,"one part of the figure in which Hogarth is allowed to have excelled,"
4702,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which these foreigners seem to have overlooked, or perhaps"
4703,LATE MR. BARRY.,"calculating from its proportion to the whole (a seventh or an eighth,"

4706,LATE MR. BARRY.,"man's body, but here it is that the painter of expression must"
4707,LATE MR. BARRY.,"condense the wonders of his skill, even at the expense of neglecting"
4708,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the ""jonctures and other difficulties of drawing in the limbs,"" which"
4709,LATE MR. BARRY.,"it must be a cold eye that, in the interest so strongly demanded by"

4714,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4715,LATE MR. BARRY.,The first impression caused in me by reading this passage was an
4716,LATE MR. BARRY.,eager desire to know who this Mr. Penny was. This great surpasser of
4717,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Hogarth in the ""delicacy of his relish,"" and the ""line which he"
4718,LATE MR. BARRY.,"pursued,"" where is he, what are his works, what has he to show? In"
4719,LATE MR. BARRY.,"vain I tried to recollect, till by happily putting the question to a"
4720,LATE MR. BARRY.,friend who is more conversant in the works of the illustrious obscure
4721,LATE MR. BARRY.,"than myself, I learnt that he was the painter of a _Death of Wolfe_"
4722,LATE MR. BARRY.,which missed the prize the year that the celebrated picture of West
4723,LATE MR. BARRY.,on the same subject obtained it; that he also made a picture of the
4724,LATE MR. BARRY.,"_Marquis of Granby relieving a Sick Soldier_; moreover, that he was"
4725,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the inventor of two pictures of _Suspended and Restored Animation_,"
4726,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which I now remember to have seen in the Exhibition some years since,"
4727,LATE MR. BARRY.,and the prints from which are still extant in good men's houses.
4728,LATE MR. BARRY.,"This, then, I suppose, is the line of subjects in which Mr. Penny was"
4729,LATE MR. BARRY.,so much superior to Hogarth. I confess I am not of that opinion. The
4730,LATE MR. BARRY.,"relieving of poverty by the purse, and the restoring a young man to"
4731,LATE MR. BARRY.,"his parents by using the methods prescribed by the Humane Society,"
4732,LATE MR. BARRY.,"are doubtless very amiable subjects, pretty things to teach the first"
4733,LATE MR. BARRY.,rudiments of humanity; they amount to about as much instruction as
4734,LATE MR. BARRY.,the stories of good boys that give away their custards to poor
4735,LATE MR. BARRY.,"beggar-boys in children's books. But, good God! is this _milk for"
4736,LATE MR. BARRY.,"babes_ to be set up in opposition to Hogarth's moral scenes, his"
4737,LATE MR. BARRY.,_strong meat for men_? As well might we prefer the fulsome verses
4738,LATE MR. BARRY.,upon their own goodness to which the gentlemen of the Literary Fund
4739,LATE MR. BARRY.,"annually sit still with such shameless patience to listen, to the"
4740,LATE MR. BARRY.,satires of Juvenal and Persius; because the former are full of tender
4741,LATE MR. BARRY.,"images of Worth relieved by Charity, and Charity stretching out her"
4742,LATE MR. BARRY.,"hand to rescue sinking Genius, and the theme of the latter is men's"
4743,LATE MR. BARRY.,crimes and follies with their black consequences--forgetful meanwhile
4744,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of those strains of moral pathos, those sublime heart-touches, which"
4745,LATE MR. BARRY.,these poets (in _them_ chiefly showing themselves poets) are
4746,LATE MR. BARRY.,perpetually darting across the otherwise appalling gloom of their
4747,LATE MR. BARRY.,"subject--consolatory remembrancers, when their pictures of guilty"
4748,LATE MR. BARRY.,"mankind have made us even to despair for our species, that there is"
4749,LATE MR. BARRY.,"such a thing as virtue and moral dignity in the world, that her"
4750,LATE MR. BARRY.,"unquenchable spark is not utterly out--refreshing admonitions, to"
4751,LATE MR. BARRY.,which we turn for shelter from the too great heat and asperity of the
4752,LATE MR. BARRY.,general satire.
4753,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4754,LATE MR. BARRY.,And is there nothing analogous to this in Hogarth? nothing which

4759,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Virtue which Shakspeare has left us, be not enough to disprove the"
4760,LATE MR. BARRY.,"assertion; if the sad endings of the Harlot and the Rake, the"
4761,LATE MR. BARRY.,passionate heart-bleeding entreaties for forgiveness which the
4762,LATE MR. BARRY.,adulterous wife is pouring forth to her assassinated and dying lord
4763,LATE MR. BARRY.,"in the last scene but one of the _Marriage Alamode_,--if these be not"
4764,LATE MR. BARRY.,"things to touch the heart, and dispose the mind to a meditative"
4765,LATE MR. BARRY.,tenderness: is there nothing sweetly conciliatory in the mild patient
4766,LATE MR. BARRY.,face and gesture with which the wife seems to allay and ventilate the
4767,LATE MR. BARRY.,feverish irritated feelings of her poor poverty-distracted mate (the
4768,LATE MR. BARRY.,"true copy of the _genus irritabile_), in the print of the _Distrest"
4769,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Poet_? or if an image of maternal love be required, where shall we"
4770,LATE MR. BARRY.,find a sublimer view of it than in that aged woman in _Industry and
4771,LATE MR. BARRY.,Idleness_ (plate V.) who is clinging with the fondness of hope not
4772,LATE MR. BARRY.,"quite extinguished to her brutal vice-hardened child, whom she is"
4773,LATE MR. BARRY.,accompanying to the ship which is to bear him away from his native
4774,LATE MR. BARRY.,"soil, of which he has been adjudged unworthy: in whose shocking face"
4775,LATE MR. BARRY.,"every trace of the human countenance seems obliterated, and a brute"
4776,LATE MR. BARRY.,"beast's to be left instead, shocking and repulsive to all but her who"
4777,LATE MR. BARRY.,"watched over it in its cradle before it was so sadly altered, and"
4778,LATE MR. BARRY.,feels it must belong to her while a pulse by the vindictive laws of
4779,LATE MR. BARRY.,his country shall be suffered to continue to beat in it. Compared
4780,LATE MR. BARRY.,"with such things, what is Mr. Penny's ""knowledge of the figure and"

4795,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4796,LATE MR. BARRY.,A person unacquainted with the works thus stigmatized would be apt to
4797,LATE MR. BARRY.,imagine that in Hogarth there was nothing else to be found but
4798,LATE MR. BARRY.,subjects of the coarsest and most repulsive nature. That his
4799,LATE MR. BARRY.,"imagination was naturally unsweet, and that he delighted in raking"
4800,LATE MR. BARRY.,into every species of moral filth. That he preyed upon sore places
4801,LATE MR. BARRY.,"only, and took a pleasure in exposing the unsound and rotten parts of"
4802,LATE MR. BARRY.,"human nature:--whereas, with the exception of some of the plates of"
4803,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the _Harlot's Progress_, which are harder in their character than any"
4804,LATE MR. BARRY.,of the rest of his productions (the _Stages of Cruelty_ I omit as
4805,LATE MR. BARRY.,"mere worthless caricatures, foreign to his general habits, the"
4806,LATE MR. BARRY.,"offspring of his fancy in some wayward humor), there is scarce one of"
4807,LATE MR. BARRY.,"his pieces where vice is most strongly satirized, in which some"
4808,LATE MR. BARRY.,figure is not introduced upon which the moral eye may rest satisfied;
4809,LATE MR. BARRY.,"a face that indicates goodness, or perhaps mere good-humoredness and"
4810,LATE MR. BARRY.,"carelessness of mind (negation of evil) only, yet enough to give a"
4811,LATE MR. BARRY.,"relaxation to the frowning brow of satire, and keep the general air"
4812,LATE MR. BARRY.,"from tainting. Take the mild, supplicating posture of patient Poverty"
4813,LATE MR. BARRY.,in the poor woman that is persuading the pawnbroker to accept her
4814,LATE MR. BARRY.,"clothes in pledge, in the plate of _Gin Lane_, for an instance. A"
4815,LATE MR. BARRY.,"little does it, a little of the _good_ nature overpowers a world of"
4816,LATE MR. BARRY.,_bad_. One cordial honest laugh of a Tom Jones absolutely clears the
4817,LATE MR. BARRY.,atmosphere that was reeking with the black putrefying breathings of a
4818,LATE MR. BARRY.,hypocrite Blifil. One homely expostulating shrug from Strap warms the
4819,LATE MR. BARRY.,whole air which the suggestions of a gentlemanly ingratitude from his
4820,LATE MR. BARRY.,"friend Random had begun to freeze. One ""Lord bless us!"" of Parson"
4821,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Adams upon the wickedness of the times, exorcises and purges off the"
4822,LATE MR. BARRY.,mass of iniquity which the world-knowledge of even a Fielding could
4823,LATE MR. BARRY.,cull out and rake together. But of the severer class of Hogarth's
4824,LATE MR. BARRY.,"performances, enough, I trust, has been said to show that they do not"
4825,LATE MR. BARRY.,"merely shock and repulse; that there is in them the ""scorn of vice"""
4826,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and the ""pity"" too; something to touch the heart, and keep alive the"
4827,LATE MR. BARRY.,"sense of moral beauty; the ""lacrymæ rerum,"" and the sorrowing by"
4828,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which the heart is made better. If they be bad things, then is satire"
4829,LATE MR. BARRY.,"and tragedy a bad thing; let us proclaim at once an age of gold, and"
4830,LATE MR. BARRY.,sink the existence of vice and misery in our speculations: let us
4831,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4832,LATE MR. BARRY.,"""----wink, and shut our apprehensions up"

4837,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4838,LATE MR. BARRY.,"But that larger half of Hogarth's works, which were painted more for"
4839,LATE MR. BARRY.,entertainment than instruction (though such was the suggestiveness of
4840,LATE MR. BARRY.,"his mind that there is always something to be learnt from them), his"
4841,LATE MR. BARRY.,"humorous scenes,--are they such as merely to disgust and set us"

4847,LATE MR. BARRY.,"read his pathetic admonition concerning the shortness of life, and"
4848,LATE MR. BARRY.,"how much better the little leisure of it were laid out upon ""that"
4849,LATE MR. BARRY.,species of art which is employed about the amiable and the
4850,LATE MR. BARRY.,"admirable;"" and Hogarth's ""method,"" proscribed as a ""dangerous or"
4851,LATE MR. BARRY.,"worthless pursuit,"" I began to think there was something in it; that"
4852,LATE MR. BARRY.,I might have been indulging all my life a passion for the works of
4853,LATE MR. BARRY.,"this artist, to the utter prejudice of my taste and moral sense; but"
4854,LATE MR. BARRY.,"my first convictions gradually returned, a world of good-natured"
4855,LATE MR. BARRY.,"English faces came up one by one to my recollection, and a glance at"
4856,LATE MR. BARRY.,"the matchless _Election Entertainment_, which I have the happiness to"
4857,LATE MR. BARRY.,"have hanging up in my parlor, subverted Mr. Barry's whole theory in"
4858,LATE MR. BARRY.,an instant.
4859,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4860,LATE MR. BARRY.,In that inimitable print (which in my judgment as far exceeds the
4861,LATE MR. BARRY.,"more known and celebrated _March to Finchley_, as the best comedy"
4862,LATE MR. BARRY.,"exceeds the best farce that ever was written), let a person look till"
4863,LATE MR. BARRY.,"he be saturated, and when he has done wondering at the inventiveness"
4864,LATE MR. BARRY.,of genius which could bring so many characters (more than thirty
4865,LATE MR. BARRY.,distinct classes of face) into a room and set them down at table
4866,LATE MR. BARRY.,"together, or otherwise dispose them about, in so natural a manner,"
4867,LATE MR. BARRY.,"engage them in so many easy sets and occupations, yet all partaking"
4868,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of the spirit of the occasion which brought them together, so that we"
4869,LATE MR. BARRY.,feel that nothing but an election time could have assembled them;
4870,LATE MR. BARRY.,"having no central figure or principal group, (for the hero of the"
4871,LATE MR. BARRY.,"piece, the Candidate, is properly set aside in the levelling"
4872,LATE MR. BARRY.,"indistinction of the day, one must look for him to find him,) nothing"
4873,LATE MR. BARRY.,"to detain the eye from passing from part to part, where every part is"
4874,LATE MR. BARRY.,"alike instinct with life,--for here are no furniture-faces, no"
4875,LATE MR. BARRY.,"figures brought in to fill up the scene like stage choruses, but all"
4876,LATE MR. BARRY.,dramatis personæ; when he shall have done wondering at all these
4877,LATE MR. BARRY.,"faces so strongly charactered, yet finished with the accuracy of the"
4878,LATE MR. BARRY.,finest miniature; when he shall have done admiring the numberless
4879,LATE MR. BARRY.,"appendages of the scene, those gratuitous doles which rich genius"
4880,LATE MR. BARRY.,"flings into the heap when it has already done enough, the"
4881,LATE MR. BARRY.,"over-measure which it delights in giving, as if it felt its stores"
4882,LATE MR. BARRY.,"were exhaustless; the dumb rhetoric of the scenery,--for tables, and"
4883,LATE MR. BARRY.,"chairs, and joint-stools in Hogarth are living and significant"
4884,LATE MR. BARRY.,things; the witticisms that are expressed by words (all artists but
4885,LATE MR. BARRY.,Hogarth have failed when they have endeavored to combine two mediums
4886,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of expression, and have introduced words into their pictures), and"
4887,LATE MR. BARRY.,the unwritten numberless little allusive pleasantries that are
4888,LATE MR. BARRY.,"scattered about; the work that is going on in the scene, and beyond"
4889,LATE MR. BARRY.,"it, as is made visible to the ""eye of mind,"" by the mob which chokes"
4890,LATE MR. BARRY.,"up the doorway, and the sword that has forced an entrance before its"
4891,LATE MR. BARRY.,master; when he shall have sufficiently admired this wealth of
4892,LATE MR. BARRY.,"genius, let him fairly say what is the _result_ left on his mind. Is"
4893,LATE MR. BARRY.,it an impression of the vileness and worthlessness of his species? or
4894,LATE MR. BARRY.,"is it not the general feeling which remains, after the individual"
4895,LATE MR. BARRY.,"faces have ceased to act sensibly on his mind, a _kindly one in favor"
4896,LATE MR. BARRY.,of his species?_ was not the general air of the scene wholesome? did
4897,LATE MR. BARRY.,it do the heart hurt to be among it? Something of a riotous spirit to
4898,LATE MR. BARRY.,"be sure is there, some worldly-mindedness in some of the faces, a"
4899,LATE MR. BARRY.,Doddingtonian smoothness which does not promise any superfluous
4900,LATE MR. BARRY.,degree of sincerity in the fine gentleman who has been the occasion
4901,LATE MR. BARRY.,of calling so much good company together; but is not the general cast
4902,LATE MR. BARRY.,of expression in the faces of the good sort? do they not seem cut out
4903,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of the _good old rock_, substantial English honesty? would one fear"
4904,LATE MR. BARRY.,treachery among characters of their expression? or shall we call
4905,LATE MR. BARRY.,their honest mirth and seldom-returning relaxation by the hard names
4906,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of vice and profligacy? That poor country fellow, that is grasping"
4907,LATE MR. BARRY.,"his staff (which, from that difficulty of feeling themselves at home"
4908,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which poor men experience at a feast, he has never parted with since"
4909,LATE MR. BARRY.,"he came into the room), and is enjoying with a relish that seems to"
4910,LATE MR. BARRY.,"fit all the capacities of his soul the slender joke, which that"
4911,LATE MR. BARRY.,"facetious wag his neighbor is practising upon the gouty gentleman,"
4912,LATE MR. BARRY.,whose eyes the effort to suppress pain has made as round as
4913,LATE MR. BARRY.,"rings--does it shock the ""dignity of human nature"" to look at that"
4914,LATE MR. BARRY.,"man, and to sympathize with him in the seldom-heard joke which has"
4915,LATE MR. BARRY.,"unbent his careworn, hard-working visage, and drawn iron smiles from"
4916,LATE MR. BARRY.,"it? or with that full-hearted cobbler, who is honoring with the grasp"
4917,LATE MR. BARRY.,"of an honest fist the unused palm of that annoyed patrician, whom the"
4918,LATE MR. BARRY.,license of the time has seated next him?
4919,LATE MR. BARRY.,
4920,LATE MR. BARRY.,"I can see nothing ""dangerous"" in the contemplation of such scenes as"
4921,LATE MR. BARRY.,"this, or the _Enraged Musician_, or the _Southwark Fair_, or twenty"
4922,LATE MR. BARRY.,"other pleasant prints which come crowding in upon my recollection, in"
4923,LATE MR. BARRY.,"which the restless activities, the diversified bents and humors, the"
4924,LATE MR. BARRY.,"blameless peculiarities of men, as they deserve to be called, rather"
4925,LATE MR. BARRY.,"than their ""vices and follies,"" are held up in a laughable point of"
4926,LATE MR. BARRY.,view. All laughter is not of a dangerous or soul-hardening tendency.
4927,LATE MR. BARRY.,There is the petrifying sneer of a demon which excludes and kills
4928,LATE MR. BARRY.,"Love, and there is the cordial laughter of a man which implies and"
4929,LATE MR. BARRY.,cherishes it. What heart was ever made the worse by joining in a
4930,LATE MR. BARRY.,"hearty laugh at the simplicities of Sir Hugh Evans or Parson Adams,"
4931,LATE MR. BARRY.,where a sense of the ridiculous mutually kindles and is kindled by a
4932,LATE MR. BARRY.,perception of the amiable? That tumultuous harmony of singers that
4933,LATE MR. BARRY.,"are roaring out the words, ""The world shall bow to the Assyrian"
4934,LATE MR. BARRY.,"throne,"" from the opera of _Judith_, in the third plate of the series"

4937,LATE MR. BARRY.,"oratorios in this country, while ""Music yet was young;"" when we have"
4938,LATE MR. BARRY.,"done smiling at the deafening distortions, which these tearers of"
4939,LATE MR. BARRY.,"devotion to rags and tatters, these takers of heaven by storm, in"
4940,LATE MR. BARRY.,"their boisterous mimicry of the occupation of angels, are"
4941,LATE MR. BARRY.,"making,--what unkindly impression is left behind, or what more of"
4942,LATE MR. BARRY.,"harsh or contemptuous feeling, than when we quietly leave Uncle Toby"

4976,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
4977,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,The poems of G. Wither are distinguished by a hearty homeliness of
4978,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"manner, and a plain moral speaking. He seems to have passed his life"
4979,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,in one continued act of an innocent self-pleasing. That which he
4980,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"calls his _Motto_ is a continued self-eulogy of two thousand lines,"
4981,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"yet we read it to the end without any feeling of distaste, almost"
4982,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,without a consciousness that we have been listening all the while to
4983,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"a man praising himself. There are none of the cold particles in it,"
4984,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"the hardness and self-ends, which render vanity and egotism hateful."
4985,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"He seems to be praising another person, under the mask of self: or"
4986,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"rather, we feel that it was indifferent to him where he found the"
4987,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,virtue which he celebrates; whether another's bosom or his own were
4988,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"its chosen receptacle. His poems are full, and this in particular is"
4989,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"one downright confession, of a generous self-seeking. But by self he"
4990,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"sometimes means a great deal,--his friends, his principles, his"
4991,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"country, the human race."
4992,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
4993,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Whoever expects to find in the satirical pieces of this writer any of
4994,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,those peculiarities which pleased him in the satires of Dryden or
4995,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Pope, will be grievously disappointed. Here are no high-finished"
4996,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"characters, no nice traits of individual nature, few or no"
4997,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"personalities. The game run down is coarse general vice, or folly as"
4998,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"it appears in classes. A liar, a drunkard, a coxcomb, is _stript and"
4999,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"whipt;_ no Shaftesbury, no Villiers, or Wharton, is curiously"
5000,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"anatomized, and read upon. But to a well-natured mind there is a"
5001,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"charm of moral sensibility running through them, which amply"
5002,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,compensates the want of those luxuries. Wither seems everywhere
5003,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"bursting with a love of goodness, and a hatred of all low and base"
5004,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,actions. At this day it is hard to discover what parts of the poem
5005,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"here particularly alluded to, _Abuses Stript and Whipt_, could have"
5006,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,occasioned the imprisonment of the author. Was Vice in High Places
5007,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,more suspicious than now? had she more power; or more leisure to
5008,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,listen after ill reports? That a man should be convicted of a libel
5009,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"when he named no names but Hate, and Envy, and Lust, and Avarice, is"
5010,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"like one of the indictments in the Pilgrim's Progress, where Faithful"
5011,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"is arraigned for having ""railed on our noble Prince Beelzebub, and"
5012,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"spoken contemptibly of his honorable friends, the Lord Old Man, the"
5013,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Lord Carnal Delight, and the Lord Luxurious."" What unlucky jealousy"
5014,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,could have tempted the great men of those days to appropriate such
5015,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,innocent abstractions to themselves?
5016,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5017,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Wither seems to have contemplated to a degree of idolatry his own
5018,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,possible virtue. He is forever anticipating persecution and
5019,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"martyrdom; fingering, as it were, the flames, to try how he can bear"
5020,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,them. Perhaps his premature defiance sometimes made him obnoxious to
5021,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,censures which he would otherwise have slipped by.
5022,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5023,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,The homely versification of these Satires is not likely to attract in
5024,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,the present day. It is certainly not such as we should expect from a
5025,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"poet ""soaring in the high region of his fancies, with his garland and"
5026,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"his singing robes about him;""[1] nor is it such as"
5027,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"he has shown in his _Philarete_, and in some parts of his _Shepherds"
5028,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Hunting_. He seems to have adopted this dress with voluntary
5029,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"humility, as fittest for a moral teacher, as our divines choose sober"
5030,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,gray or black; but in their humility consists their sweetness. The
5031,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,deepest tone of moral feeling in them (though all throughout is
5032,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"weighty, earnest, and passionate) is in those pathetic injunctions"
5033,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"against shedding of blood in quarrels, in the chapter entitled"
5034,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"_Revenge_. The story of his own forbearance, which follows, is highly"
5035,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"interesting. While the Christian sings his own victory over Anger,"
5036,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"the Man of Courage cannot help peeping out to let you know, that it"
5037,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,was some higher principle than _fear_ which counselled this
5038,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,forbearance.
5039,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5040,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,[Footnote 1: Milton.]
5041,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5042,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Whether encaged, or roaming at liberty, Wither never seems to have"
5043,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,abated a jot of that free spirit which sets its mark upon his
5044,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"writings, as much as a predominant feature of independence impresses"
5045,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,every page of our late glorious Burns; but the elder poet wraps his
5046,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"proof-armor closer about him, the other wears his too much outwards;"
5047,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,he is thinking too much of annoying the foe to be quite easy within;
5048,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,the spiritual defences of Wither are a perpetual source of inward
5049,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"sunshine, the magnanimity of the modern is not without its alloy of"
5050,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"soreness, and a sense of injustice, which seems perpetually to gall"
5051,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"and irritate. Wither was better skilled in the ""sweet uses of"
5052,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"adversity;"" he knew how to extract the ""precious jewel"" from the head"
5053,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"of the ""toad,"" without drawing any of the ""ugly venom"" along with it."
5054,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,The prison-notes of Wither are finer than the wood-notes of most of
5055,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,his poetical brethren. The description in the Fourth Eclogue of his
5056,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,_Shepherds Hunting_ (which was composed during his imprisonment in
5057,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,the Marshalsea) of the power of the Muse to extract pleasure from
5058,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"common objects, has been oftener quoted, and is more known, than any"
5059,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"part of his writings. Indeed, the whole Eclogue is in a strain so"
5060,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"much above not only what himself, but almost what any other poet has"
5061,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"written, that he himself could not help noticing it; he remarks that"
5062,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"his spirits had been raised higher than they were wont, ""through the"
5063,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"love of poesy."" The praises of Poetry have been often sung in ancient"
5064,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,and in modern times; strange powers have been ascribed to it of
5065,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,influence over animate and inanimate auditors; its force over
5066,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"fascinated crowds has been acknowledged; but, before Wither, no one"
5067,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"ever celebrated its power _at home_, the wealth and the strength"
5068,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"which this divine gift confers upon its possessor. Fame, and that too"
5069,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"after death, was all which hitherto the poets had promised themselves"
5070,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,from their art. It seems to have been left to Wither to discover that
5071,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"poetry was a present possession, as well as a rich reversion, and"
5072,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"that the Muse had promise of both lives,--of this, and of that which"
5073,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,was to come.
5074,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5075,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,The _Mistress of Philarete_ is in substance a panegyric protracted
5076,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"through several thousand lines in the mouth of a single speaker, but"
5077,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"diversified, so as to produce an almost dramatic effect, by the"
5078,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"artful introduction of some ladies, who are rather auditors than"
5079,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"interlocutors in the scene; and of a boy, whose singing furnishes"
5080,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,pretence for an occasional change of metre: though the seven-syllable
5081,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"line, in which the main part of it is written, is that in which"
5082,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Wither has shown himself so great a master, that I do not know that I"
5083,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,am always thankful to him for the exchange.
5084,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5085,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Wither has chosen to bestow upon the lady whom he commends the name
5086,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"of Arete, or Virtue; and, assuming to himself the character of"
5087,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Philarete, or Lover of Virtue, there is a sort of propriety in that"
5088,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,heaped measure of perfections which he attributes to this partly
5089,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"real, partly allegorical personage. Drayton before him had shadowed"
5090,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"his mistress under the name of Idea, or Perfect Pattern, and some of"
5091,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,the old Italian love-strains are couched in such religious terms as
5092,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"to make it doubtful whether it be a mistress, or Divine Grace, which"
5093,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,the poet is addressing.
5094,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5095,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,In this poem (full of beauties) there are two passages of preeminent
5096,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"merit. The first is where the lover, after a flight of rapturous"
5097,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"commendation, expresses his wonder why all men that are about his"
5098,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"mistress, even to her very servants, do not view her with the same"
5099,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,eyes that he does.
5100,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5101,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"""Sometime I do admire"
5102,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,All men burn not with desire:
5103,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Nay, I muse her servants are not"
5104,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Pleading love; but 0! they dare not.
5105,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"And I therefore wonder, why"
5106,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,They do not grow sick and die.
5107,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Sure they would do so, but that,"
5108,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"By the ordinance of fate,"
5109,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"There is some concealed thing,"
5110,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"So each gazer limiting,"
5111,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"He can see no more of merit,"
5112,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Than beseems his worth and spirit.
5113,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"For in her a grace there shines,"
5114,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"That o'er-daring thoughts confines,"
5115,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Making worthless men despair
5116,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,To be loved of one so fair.
5117,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Yea, the destinies agree,"
5118,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Some _good judgments_ blind should be,"
5119,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,And not gain the power of knowing
5120,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Those rare beauties in her growing.
5121,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Reason doth as much imply:
5122,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"For, if every judging eye,"
5123,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Which beholdeth her, should there"
5124,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"Find what excellences are,"
5125,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"All, o'ercome by those perfections,"
5126,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,Would be captive to affections.
5127,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"So, in happiness unblest,"
5128,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"She for lovers should not rest."""
5129,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5130,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"The other is, where he has been comparing her beauties to gold, and"
5131,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"stars, and the most excellent things in nature; and, fearing to be"
5132,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"accused of hyperbole, the common charge against poets, vindicates"
5133,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"himself by boldly taking upon him, that these comparisons are no"
5134,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"hyperboles; but that the best things in nature do, in a lover's eye,"
5135,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,fall short of those excellences which he adores in her.
5136,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,
5137,POETICAL WORKS OF GEORGE WITHER,"""What pearls, what rubies can"

5450,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,that the breath has taken leave to that of its final commitment to
5451,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the earth. His ministry begins where the physician's, the lawyer's,"
5452,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,and the divine's end. Or if some part of the functions of the latter
5453,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"run parallel with his, it is only _in ordine ad spiritualia_. His"
5454,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,temporalities remain unquestioned. He is arbitrator of all questions
5455,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,of honor which may concern the defunct; and upon slight inspection
5456,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,will pronounce how long he may remain in this upper world with credit
5457,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"to himself, and when it will be prudent for his reputation that he"
5458,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,should retire. His determination in these points is peremptory and
5459,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"without appeal. Yet, with a modesty peculiar to his profession, he"
5460,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,meddles not out of his own sphere. With the good or bad actions of
5461,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,the deceased in his lifetime he has nothing to do. He leaves the
5462,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,friends of the dead man to form their own conjectures as to the place
5463,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,to which the departed spirit is gone. His care is only about the
5464,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"exuviæ. He concerns not himself even about the body, as it is a"
5465,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"structure of parts internal, and a wonderful microcosm. He leaves"
5466,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"such curious speculations to the anatomy professor. Or, if anything,"
5467,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"he is averse to such wanton inquiries, as delighting rather that the"
5468,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,parts which he has care of should be returned to their kindred dust
5469,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,in as handsome and unmutilated condition as possible; that the grave
5470,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"should have its full and unimpaired tribute,--a complete and just"
5471,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"carcass. Nor is he only careful to provide for the body's entireness,"
5472,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,but for its accommodation and ornament. He orders the fashion of its
5473,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"clothes, and designs the symmetry of its dwelling. Its vanity has an"
5474,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,innocent survival in him. He is bedmaker to the dead. The pillows
5475,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,which he lays never rumple. The day of interment is the theatre in
5476,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,which he displays the mysteries of his art. It is hard to describe
5477,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"what he is, or rather to tell what he is not, on that day: for, being"
5478,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"neither kinsman, servant, nor friend, he is all in turns; a"
5479,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"transcendant, running through all those relations. His office is to"
5480,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"supply the place of self-agency in the family, who are presumed"
5481,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"incapable of it through grief. He is eyes, and ears, and hands, to"
5482,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,the whole household. A draught of wine cannot go round to the
5483,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"mourners, but he must minister it. A chair may hardly be restored to"
5484,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,its place by a less solemn hand than his. He takes upon himself all
5485,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"functions, and is a sort of ephemeral major-domo! He distributes his"
5486,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,attentions among the company assembled according to the degree of
5487,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"affliction, which he calculates from the degree of kin to the"
5488,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,deceased; and marshals them accordingly in the procession. He himself
5489,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,is of a sad and tristful countenance; yet such as (if well examined)
5490,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,is not without some show of patience and resignation at bottom;
5491,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"prefiguring, as it were, to the friends of the deceased, what their"

5493,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,down the bitterness of their first anguish; so handsomely can he
5494,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"fore-shape and anticipate the work of Time. Lastly, with his wand, as"
5495,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"with another divining rod, he calculates the depth of earth at which"
5496,CHARACTER OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the bones of the dead man may rest, which he ordinarily contrives may"

5954,CELESTINA.,
5955,CELESTINA.,"At the sight of this paper, I ran in frantic haste to Celestina's"
5956,CELESTINA.,"lodgings, where I learned, to my infinite mortification, that the"
5957,CELESTINA.,mother and daughter were set off on a journey to a distant part of
5958,CELESTINA.,"the country, to visit a relation, and were not expected to return in"
5959,CELESTINA.,less than four months.
5960,CELESTINA.,
5961,CELESTINA.,"Stunned by this blow, which left me without the courage to solicit an"
5962,CELESTINA.,"explanation by letter, even if I had known where they were, (for the"
5963,CELESTINA.,"particular address was industriously concealed from me,) I waited"
5964,CELESTINA.,"with impatience the termination of the period, in the vain hope that"
5965,CELESTINA.,I might be permitted to have a chance of softening the harsh decision
5966,CELESTINA.,by a personal interview with Celestina after her return. But before
5967,CELESTINA.,"three months were at an end, I learned from the newspapers that my"
5968,CELESTINA.,beloved had----given her hand to another.
5969,CELESTINA.,
5970,CELESTINA.,"Heart-broken as I was, I was totally at a loss to account for the"
5971,CELESTINA.,strange step which she had taken; and it was not till some years
5972,CELESTINA.,"after that I learned the true reason from a female relation of hers,"
5973,CELESTINA.,"to whom it seems Celestina had confessed in confidence, that it was"
5974,CELESTINA.,no demerit of mine that had caused her to break off the match so
5975,CELESTINA.,"abruptly, nor any preference which she might feel for any other"
5976,CELESTINA.,"person, for she preferred me (she was pleased to say) to all mankind;"
5977,CELESTINA.,"but when she came to lay the matter closer to her heart, she found"
5978,CELESTINA.,that she never should be able to bear the sight--(I give you her very
5979,CELESTINA.,words as they were detailed to me by her relation)--the sight of a
5980,CELESTINA.,man in a nightcap who had appeared on a public platform--it would
5981,CELESTINA.,lead to such a disagreeable association of ideas! And to this
5982,CELESTINA.,punctilio I was sacrificed.
5983,CELESTINA.,
5984,CELESTINA.,"To pass over an infinite series of minor mortifications, to which"
5985,CELESTINA.,"this last and heaviest might well render me callous, behold me here,"
5986,CELESTINA.,"Mr. Editor! in the thirty-seventh year of my existence, (the twelfth,"
5987,CELESTINA.,"reckoning from my reanimation,) cut off from all respectable"
5988,CELESTINA.,"connections: rejected by the fairer half of the community,--who in my"
5989,CELESTINA.,case alone seem to have laid aside the characteristic pity of their
5990,CELESTINA.,sex; punished because I was once punished unjustly: suffering for no
5991,CELESTINA.,other reason than because I once had the misfortune to suffer without
5992,CELESTINA.,"any cause at all. In no other country, I think, but this, could a man"
5993,CELESTINA.,"have been subject to such a life-long persecution, when once his"
5994,CELESTINA.,innocence had been clearly established.
5995,CELESTINA.,
5996,CELESTINA.,Had I crawled forth a rescued victim from the rack in the horrible
5997,CELESTINA.,"dungeons of the Inquisition,--had I heaved myself up from a half"
5998,CELESTINA.,"bastinado in China, or been torn from the just-entering, ghastly"
5999,CELESTINA.,"impaling stake in Barbary,--had I dropt alive from the knout in"
6000,CELESTINA.,"Russia, or come off with a gashed neck from the half-mortal,"
6001,CELESTINA.,scarce-in-time-retracted cimeter of an executioneering slave in
6002,CELESTINA.,"Turkey,--I might have borne about the remnant of this frame (the"
6003,CELESTINA.,mangled trophy of reprieved innocence) with credit to myself in any
6004,CELESTINA.,"of those barbarous countries. No scorn, at least, would have mingled"
6005,CELESTINA.,with the pity (small as it might be) with which what was left of me
6006,CELESTINA.,would have been surveyed.
6007,CELESTINA.,
6008,CELESTINA.,The singularity of my case has often led me to inquire into the
6009,CELESTINA.,reasons of the general levity with which the subject of hanging is
6010,CELESTINA.,"treated as a topic in this country. I say, as a topic: for let the"
6011,CELESTINA.,very persons who speak so lightly of the thing at a distance be
6012,CELESTINA.,"brought to view the real scene,--let the platform be bona fide"
6013,CELESTINA.,"exhibited, and the trembling culprit brought forth,--the case is"
6014,CELESTINA.,"changed; but as a topic of conversation, I appeal to the vulgar jokes"
6015,CELESTINA.,"which pass current in every street. But why mention them, when the"
6016,CELESTINA.,politest authors have agreed in making use of this subject as a
6017,CELESTINA.,"source of the ridiculous? Swift, and Pope, and Prior, are fond of"
6018,CELESTINA.,recurring to it. Gay has built an entire drama upon this single
6019,CELESTINA.,foundation. The whole interest of the _Beggar's Opera_ may be said to
6020,CELESTINA.,hang upon it. To such writers as Fielding and Smollett it is a
6021,CELESTINA.,"perfect _bonne-bouche_.--Hear the facetious Tom Brown, in his"
6022,CELESTINA.,"_Comical View of London and Westminster_, describe the _Order of the"
6023,CELESTINA.,"Show at one of the Tyburn Executions_ in his time:--""Mr. Ordinary"
6024,CELESTINA.,visits his melancholy flock in Newgate by eight. Doleful procession
6025,CELESTINA.,up Holborn Hill about eleven. Men handsome and proper that were never
6026,CELESTINA.,"thought so before, which is some comfort however. Arrive at the fatal"
6027,CELESTINA.,"place by twelve. Burnt brandy, women, and sabbath-breaking, repented"
6028,CELESTINA.,"of. Some few penitential drops fall under the gallows. Sheriffs' men,"
6029,CELESTINA.,"parson, pickpockets, criminals, all very busy. The last concluding"
6030,CELESTINA.,"peremptory psalm struck up. Show over by one.""--In this sportive"
6031,CELESTINA.,strain does this misguided wit think proper to play with a subject so
6032,CELESTINA.,"serious, which yet he would hardly have done if he had not known that"
6033,CELESTINA.,there existed a predisposition in the habits of his unaccountable
6034,CELESTINA.,countrymen to consider the subject as a jest. But what shall we say
6035,CELESTINA.,"to Shakspeare, who, (not to mention the solution which the"
6036,CELESTINA.,"_Gravedigger_ in _Hamlet_ gives of his fellow-workman's problem,) in"
6037,CELESTINA.,"that scene in _Measure for Measure_, where the _Clown_ calls upon"
6038,CELESTINA.,"_Master Barnardine_ to get up and be hanged, which he declines on the"
6039,CELESTINA.,"score of being sleepy, has actually gone out of his way to gratify"
6040,CELESTINA.,"this amiable propensity in his countrymen; for it is plain, from the"
6041,CELESTINA.,"use that was to be made of his head, and from _Abhorson's_ asking,"
6042,CELESTINA.,"""Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?"" that beheading, and not hanging,"
6043,CELESTINA.,was the punishment to which _Barnardine_ was destined. But Shakspeare
6044,CELESTINA.,"knew that the axe and block were pregnant with no ludicrous images,"
6045,CELESTINA.,and therefore falsified the historic truth of his own drama (if I may
6046,CELESTINA.,"so speak), rather than he would leave out such excellent matter for a"
6047,CELESTINA.,jest as the suspending of a fellow-creature in mid-air has been ever
6048,CELESTINA.,esteemed to be by Englishmen.
6049,CELESTINA.,
6050,CELESTINA.,One reason why the ludicrous never fails to intrude itself into our
6051,CELESTINA.,"contemplations upon this mode of death, I suppose to be, the absurd"
6052,CELESTINA.,"posture into which a man is thrown who is condemned to dance, as the"
6053,CELESTINA.,"vulgar delight to express it, upon nothing. To see him whisking and"
6054,CELESTINA.,"wavering in the air,"
6055,CELESTINA.,
6056,CELESTINA.,"""As the wind you know will wave a man;""[1]"
6057,CELESTINA.,
6058,CELESTINA.,"to behold the vacant carcass, from which the life is newly dislodged,"
6059,CELESTINA.,"shifting between earth and heaven, the sport of every gust; like a"
6060,CELESTINA.,"weathercock, serving to show from which point the wind blows; like a"
6061,CELESTINA.,"maukin, fit only to scare away birds; like a nest left to swing upon"
6062,CELESTINA.,a bough when the bird is flown: these are uses to which we cannot
6063,CELESTINA.,without a mixture of spleen and contempt behold the human carcass
6064,CELESTINA.,"reduced. We string up dogs, foxes, bats, moles, weasels. Man surely"
6065,CELESTINA.,deserves a steadier death.
6066,CELESTINA.,
6067,CELESTINA.,[Footnote 1: Hieronimo in the Spanish Tragedy.]
6068,CELESTINA.,
6069,CELESTINA.,Another reason why the ludicrous associates more forcibly with this
6070,CELESTINA.,"than with any other mode of punishment, I cannot help thinking to be,"
6071,CELESTINA.,the senseless costume with which old prescription has thought fit to
6072,CELESTINA.,clothe the exit of malefactors in this country. Let a man do what he
6073,CELESTINA.,"will to abstract from his imagination all idea of the whimsical,"
6074,CELESTINA.,something of it will come across him when he contemplates the figure
6075,CELESTINA.,of a fellow-creature in the daytime (in however distressing a
6076,CELESTINA.,situation) in a nightcap. Whether it be that this nocturnal addition
6077,CELESTINA.,"has something discordant with daylight, or that it is the dress which"
6078,CELESTINA.,"we are seen in at those times when we are ""seen,"" as the Angel in"
6079,CELESTINA.,"Milton expresses it, ""least wise,""--this, I am afraid, will always be"
6080,CELESTINA.,"the case; unless, indeed, as in my instance, some strong personal"
6081,CELESTINA.,"feeling overpower the ludicrous altogether. To me, when I reflect"
6082,CELESTINA.,"upon the train of misfortunes which have pursued men through life,"

6093,CELESTINA.,"Suffer me, Mr. Editor, before I quit the subject, to say a word or"
6094,CELESTINA.,two respecting the minister of justice in this country; in plain
6095,CELESTINA.,"words, I mean the hangman. It has always appeared to me that, in the"
6096,CELESTINA.,"mode of inflicting capital punishments with us, there is too much of"
6097,CELESTINA.,"the ministry of the human hand. The guillotine, as performing its"
6098,CELESTINA.,"functions more of itself and sparing human agency, though a cruel and"
6099,CELESTINA.,"disgusting exhibition, in my mind has many ways the advantage over"
6100,CELESTINA.,"_our way_. In beheading, indeed, as it was formerly practised in"
6101,CELESTINA.,"England, and in whipping to death, as is sometimes practised now, the"
6102,CELESTINA.,hand of man is no doubt sufficiently busy; but there is something
6103,CELESTINA.,less repugnant in these downright blows than in the officious
6104,CELESTINA.,barber-like ministerings of _the other_. To have a fellow with his
6105,CELESTINA.,"hangman's hands fumbling about your collar, adjusting the thing as"
6106,CELESTINA.,"your valet would regulate your cravat, valuing himself on his menial"
6107,CELESTINA.,dexterity----
6108,CELESTINA.,
6109,CELESTINA.,"I never shall forget meeting my rascal,--I mean the fellow who"
6110,CELESTINA.,"officiated for me,--in London last winter. I think I see him now,--in"
6111,CELESTINA.,"a waistcoat that had been mine,--smirking along as if he knew me----"
6112,CELESTINA.,
6113,CELESTINA.,"In some parts of Germany, that fellow's office is by law declared"
6114,CELESTINA.,"infamous, and his posterity incapable of being ennobled. They have"
6115,CELESTINA.,"hereditary hangmen, or had at least, in the same manner as they had"
6116,CELESTINA.,hereditary other great officers of state; and the hangmen's families
6117,CELESTINA.,"of two adjoining parishes intermarried with each other, to keep the"
6118,CELESTINA.,breed entire. I wish something of the same kind were established in

6281,ON THE MELANCHOLY OF TAILORS.,"distemper which he had never read of, Dennis (who appears not to have"

7250,ACT I.,
7251,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ My conversation--
7252,ACT I.,
7253,ACT I.,_Belvil._ Equally remote from flippancy and taciturnity.
7254,ACT I.,
7255,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ But then my name--damn my name!
7256,ACT I.,
7257,ACT I.,_Belvil._ Childish!
7258,ACT I.,
7259,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ Not so. Oh, Belvil, you are blessed with one which sighing"
7260,ACT I.,"virgins may repeat without a blush, and for it change the paternal."
7261,ACT I.,But what virgin of any delicacy (and I require some in a wife) would
7262,ACT I.,endure to be called Mrs.----?
7263,ACT I.,
7264,ACT I.,"_Belvil._ Ha, ha, ha! most absurd. Did not Clementina Falconbridge,"
7265,ACT I.,"the romantic Clementina Falconbridge, fancy Tommy Potts? and"
7266,ACT I.,Rosabella Sweetlips sacrifice her mellifluous appellative to Jack
7267,ACT I.,"Deady? Matilda her cousin married a Gubbins, and her sister Amelia a"
7268,ACT I.,Clutterbuck.
7269,ACT I.,
7270,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ Potts is tolerable, Deady is sufferable, Gubbins is"
7271,ACT I.,"bearable, and Clutterbuck is endurable, but Ho----"
7272,ACT I.,
7273,ACT I.,"_Belvil._ Hush, Jack, don't betray yourself. But you are really"
7274,ACT I.,ashamed of the family-name?
7275,ACT I.,
7276,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ Ay, and of my father that begot me, and my father's father,"
7277,ACT I.,and all their forefathers that have borne it since the Conquest.
7278,ACT I.,
7279,ACT I.,_Belvil_. But how do you know the women are so squeamish?
7280,ACT I.,
7281,ACT I.,_Mr. H_. I have tried them. I tell you there is neither maiden of
7282,ACT I.,sixteen nor widow of sixty but would turn up their noses at it. I
7283,ACT I.,"have been refused by nineteen virgins, twenty-nine relicts, and two"
7284,ACT I.,old maids.
7285,ACT I.,
7286,ACT I.,"_Belvil_. That was hard indeed, Jack."
7287,ACT I.,
7288,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. Parsons have stuck at publishing the banns, because they"
7289,ACT I.,averred it was a heathenish name; parents have lingered their
7290,ACT I.,"consent, because they suspected it was a fictitious name; and rivals"
7291,ACT I.,"have declined my challenges, because they pretended it was an"
7292,ACT I.,ungentlemanly name.
7293,ACT I.,
7294,ACT I.,"_Belvil_. Ha, ha, ha! but what course do you mean to pursue?"
7295,ACT I.,
7296,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. To engage the affections of some generous girl, who will be"
7297,ACT I.,content to take me as Mr. H.
7298,ACT I.,
7299,ACT I.,_Belvil_. Mr. H.?
7300,ACT I.,
7301,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. Yes, that is the name I go by here; you know one likes to be"
7302,ACT I.,as near the truth as possible.
7303,ACT I.,
7304,ACT I.,_Belvil_. Certainly. But what then? to get her to consent--
7305,ACT I.,
7306,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. To accompany me to the altar without a name--in short, to"
7307,ACT I.,suspend her curiosity (that is all) till the moment the priest shall
7308,ACT I.,"pronounce the irrevocable charm, which makes two names one."
7309,ACT I.,
7310,ACT I.,"_Belvil_. And that name--and then she must be pleased, ha, Jack?"
7311,ACT I.,
7312,ACT I.,_Mr. H_. Exactly such a girl it has been my fortune to meet with;
7313,ACT I.,"hark'e (_whispers_)--(_musing_). Yet, hang it! 'tis cruel to betray"
7314,ACT I.,her confidence.
7315,ACT I.,
7316,ACT I.,"_Belvil_. But the family-name, Jack?"
7317,ACT I.,
7318,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. As you say, the family-name must be perpetuated."
7319,ACT I.,
7320,ACT I.,_Belvil._ Though it be but a homely one.
7321,ACT I.,
7322,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ True; but come, I will show you the house where dwells this"
7323,ACT I.,credulous melting fair.

7332,ACT I.,
7333,ACT I.,"_Melesinda._ H, H, H. Sure it must be something precious by its being"
7334,ACT I.,"concealed. It can't be Homer, that is a Heathen's name; nor Horatio,"
7335,ACT I.,"that is no surname: what if it be Hamlet? the Lord Hamlet--pretty,"
7336,ACT I.,"and I his poor distracted Ophelia! No,'tis none of these; 'tis"
7337,ACT I.,"Harcourt or Hargrave, or some such sounding name, or Howard,"
7338,ACT I.,"high-born Howard, that would do; maybe it is Harley, methinks my H."
7339,ACT I.,"resembles Harley, the feeling Harley. But I hear him! and from his"

7341,ACT I.,

7343,ACT I.,
7344,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ My dear Melesinda.
7345,ACT I.,
7346,ACT I.,_Melesinda._ My dear H. that is all you give me power to swear
7347,ACT I.,"allegiance to,--to be enamored of inarticulate sounds, and call with"
7348,ACT I.,sighs upon an empty letter. But I will know.
7349,ACT I.,
7350,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ My dear Melesinda, press me no more for the disclosure of"
7351,ACT I.,"that, which in the face of day so soon must be revealed. Call it"
7352,ACT I.,"whim, humor, caprice, in me. Suppose, I have sworn an oath, never,"
7353,ACT I.,"till the ceremony of our marriage is over, to disclose my true name."
7354,ACT I.,
7355,ACT I.,"_Melesinda._ Oh! H, H, H. I cherish here a fire of restless curiosity"

7358,ACT I.,
7359,ACT I.,_Mr. H_. Ungenerous Melesinda! I implore you to give me this one
7360,ACT I.,"proof of your confidence. The holy vow once past, your H. shall not"
7361,ACT I.,have a secret to withhold.
7362,ACT I.,
7363,ACT I.,_Melesinda_. My H. has overcome: his Melesinda shall pine away and
7364,ACT I.,"die, before she dare express a saucy inclination; but what shall I"
7365,ACT I.,call you till we are married?
7366,ACT I.,
7367,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. Call me? call me anything, call me Love, Love! ay Love: Love"
7368,ACT I.,will do very well.
7369,ACT I.,
7370,ACT I.,"_Melesinda_. How many syllables is it, Love?"
7371,ACT I.,
7372,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. How many? ud, that is coming to the question with a"
7373,ACT I.,"vengeance! One, two, three, four,--what does it signify how many"
7374,ACT I.,syllables?
7375,ACT I.,
7376,ACT I.,"_Melesinda_. How many syllables, Love?"
7377,ACT I.,
7378,ACT I.,"_Mr. H_. My Melesinda's mind, I had hoped, was superior to this"

7388,ACT I.,
7389,ACT I.,"_1st Waiter_. Sir Harbottle Hammond, you may depend upon it."
7390,ACT I.,
7391,ACT I.,"_2d Waiter_. Sir Harry Hardcastle, I tell you."
7392,ACT I.,
7393,ACT I.,_1st Waiter_. The Hammonds of Huntingdonshire.
7394,ACT I.,
7395,ACT I.,_2d Waiter_. The Hardcastles of Hertfordshire.
7396,ACT I.,
7397,ACT I.,_1st Waiter_. The Hammonds.
7398,ACT I.,
7399,ACT I.,"_2d Waiter_. Don't tell me: does not Hardcastle begin, with an H?"
7400,ACT I.,
7401,ACT I.,_1st Waiter_. So does Hammond for that matter.
7402,ACT I.,
7403,ACT I.,"_2d Waiter_. Faith, so it does if you go to spell it, I did not think"
7404,ACT I.,of that. I begin to be of your opinion: he is certainly a Hammond.
7405,ACT I.,
7406,ACT I.,_1st Waiter_. Here comes Susan Chambermaid: maybe she can tell.
7407,ACT I.,
7408,ACT I.,_Enter_ SUSAN.
7409,ACT I.,
7410,ACT I.,"_Both_. Well, Susan, have you heard anything who the strange"
7411,ACT I.,gentleman is?
7412,ACT I.,
7413,ACT I.,"_Susan_. Haven't you heard? it's all come out! Mrs. Guesswell, the"
7414,ACT I.,"parson's widow, has been here about it. I overheard her talking in"
7415,ACT I.,"confidence to Mrs. Setter and Mrs. Pointer, and she says they were"
7416,ACT I.,holding a sort of a _cummitty_ about it.
7417,ACT I.,
7418,ACT I.,_Both_. What? What?
7419,ACT I.,
7420,ACT I.,"_Susan_. There can't be a doubt of it, she says, what from his"
7421,ACT I.,"_figger_ and the appearance he cuts, and his _sumpshous_ way of"
7422,ACT I.,"living, and above all from the remarkable circumstance that his"
7423,ACT I.,"surname should begin with an H., that he must be--"
7424,ACT I.,
7425,ACT I.,"_Both_. Well, well--"
7426,ACT I.,
7427,ACT I.,_Susan_. Neither more nor less than the Prince.
7428,ACT I.,
7429,ACT I.,_Both_. Prince!
7430,ACT I.,
7431,ACT I.,_Susan_. The Prince of Hessey-Cassel in disguise.
7432,ACT I.,
7433,ACT I.,"_Both_. Very likely, very likely."
7434,ACT I.,
7435,ACT I.,"_Susan_. Oh, there can't be a doubt on it. Mrs. Guesswell says she"
7436,ACT I.,knows it.
7437,ACT I.,
7438,ACT I.,_1st Waiter_. Now if we could be sure that the Prince of Hessy
7439,ACT I.,what-do-you-call-him was in England on his travels.
7440,ACT I.,
7441,ACT I.,_2d Waiter_. Get a newspaper. Look in the newspapers.
7442,ACT I.,
7443,ACT I.,_Susan_. Fiddle of the newspapers; who else can it be?
7444,ACT I.,
7445,ACT I.,_Both_. That is very true (_gravely_).
7446,ACT I.,
7447,ACT I.,_Enter_ LANDLORD.
7448,ACT I.,
7449,ACT I.,"_Landlord_. Here, Susan, James, Philip, where are you all? The London"
7450,ACT I.,"coach is come in, and there is Mr. Fillaside, the fat passenger, has"
7451,ACT I.,been bawling for somebody to help him off with his boots.
7452,ACT I.,
7453,ACT I.,[_The Chambermaid and Waiters slip out_.
7454,ACT I.,
7455,ACT I.,(_Solus_.) The house is turned upside down since the strange
7456,ACT I.,"gentleman came into it. Nothing but guessing and speculating, and"
7457,ACT I.,speculating and guessing; waiters and chambermaids getting into
7458,ACT I.,corners and speculating; hostlers and stable-boys speculating in the
7459,ACT I.,"yard; I believe the very horses in the stable are speculating too,"
7460,ACT I.,"for there they stand in a musing posture, nothing for them to eat,"
7461,ACT I.,and not seeming to care whether they have anything or no; and after
7462,ACT I.,"all what does it signify? I hate such curious--odso, I must take this"
7463,ACT I.,box up into his bedroom--he charged me to see to it myself;--I hate
7464,ACT I.,such inquisitive--I wonder what is in it--it feels heavy; (_reads_)
7465,ACT I.,"""Leases, title-deeds, wills."" Here now a man might satisfy his"
7466,ACT I.,"curiosity at once. Deeds must have names to them, so must leases and"
7467,ACT I.,wills. But I wouldn't--no I wouldn't--it is a pretty box
7468,ACT I.,too--prettily dovetailed--I admire the fashion of it much. But I'd
7469,ACT I.,"cut my fingers off, before I'd do such a dirty--what have I to"
7470,ACT I.,"do--curse the keys, how they rattle!--rattle in one's pockets--the"
7471,ACT I.,keys and the half-pence (_takes out a bunch and plays with them_). I
7472,ACT I.,"wonder if any of these would fit; one might just try them, but I"
7473,ACT I.,"wouldn't lift up the lid if they did. Oh no, what should I be the"
7474,ACT I.,richer for knowing? (_All this time he tries the keys one by one._)
7475,ACT I.,What's his name to me? a thousand names begin with an H. I hate
7476,ACT I.,"people that are always prying, poking and prying into"
7477,ACT I.,"things,--thrusting their finger into one place--a mighty little hole"
7478,ACT I.,this--and their keys into another. Oh Lord! little rusty fits it! but
7479,ACT I.,"what is that to me? I wouldn't go to--no, no--but it is odd little"
7480,ACT I.,rusty should just happen--(_While he is turning up the lid of the
7481,ACT I.,"box, _Mr. H. _enters behind him unperceived._)"
7482,ACT I.,
7483,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ What are you about, you dog?"
7484,ACT I.,
7485,ACT I.,"_Landlord._ Oh Lord, Sir I pardon; no thief, as I hope to be saved."
7486,ACT I.,Little Pry was always honest.
7487,ACT I.,
7488,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ What else could move you to open that box?
7489,ACT I.,
7490,ACT I.,"_Landlord._ Sir, don't kill me, and I will confess the whole truth."
7491,ACT I.,"This box happened to be lying--that is, I happened to be carrying"
7492,ACT I.,"this box, and I happened to have my keys out, and so--little rusty"
7493,ACT I.,happened to fit--
7494,ACT I.,
7495,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ So little rusty happened to fit!--and would not a rope fit
7496,ACT I.,"that rogue's neck? I see the papers have not been moved: all is safe,"
7497,ACT I.,"but it was as well to frighten him a little (_aside_). Come,"
7498,ACT I.,"Landlord, as I think you honest, and suspect you only intended to"
7499,ACT I.,gratify a little foolish curiosity--
7500,ACT I.,
7501,ACT I.,"_Landlord_. That was all, Sir, upon my veracity."
7502,ACT I.,
7503,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ For this time I will pass it over. Your name is Pry, I"
7504,ACT I.,think?
7505,ACT I.,
7506,ACT I.,"_Landlord_. Yes, Sir, Jeremiah Pry, at your service."
7507,ACT I.,
7508,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ An apt name: you have a prying temper--I mean some little
7509,ACT I.,curiosity--a sort of inquisitiveness about you.
7510,ACT I.,
7511,ACT I.,"_Landlord_. A natural thirst after knowledge you may call it, Sir."
7512,ACT I.,"When a boy, I was never easy but when I was thrusting up the lids of"
7513,ACT I.,"some of my schoolfellows' boxes,--not to steal anything, upon my"
7514,ACT I.,"honor, Sir,--only to see what was in them; have had pens stuck in my"
7515,ACT I.,eyes for peeping through keyholes after knowledge; could never see a
7516,ACT I.,"cold pie with the legs dangling out at top, but my fingers were for"
7517,ACT I.,"lifting up the crust,--just to try if it were pigeon or"
7518,ACT I.,"partridge,--for no other reason in the world. Surely I think my"
7519,ACT I.,passion for nuts was owing to the pleasure of cracking the shell to
7520,ACT I.,"get at something concealed, more than to any delight I took in eating"
7521,ACT I.,"the kernel. In short, Sir, this appetite has grown with my growth."
7522,ACT I.,
7523,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ You will certainly be hanged some day for peeping into some
7524,ACT I.,bureau or other just to see what is in it.
7525,ACT I.,
7526,ACT I.,"_Landlord._ That is my fear, Sir. The thumps and kicks I have had for"
7527,ACT I.,"peering into parcels, and turning of letters inside out,--just for"
7528,ACT I.,curiosity. The blankets I have been made to dance in for searching
7529,ACT I.,"parish registers for old ladies' ages,--just for curiosity! Once I"
7530,ACT I.,"was dragged through a horsepond, only for peeping into a closet that"
7531,ACT I.,"had glass-doors to it, while my Lady Bluegarters was"
7532,ACT I.,"undressing,--just for curiosity!"
7533,ACT I.,
7534,ACT I.,"_Mr. H._ A very harmless piece of curiosity, truly; and now, Mr. Pry,"
7535,ACT I.,"first have the goodness to leave that box with me, and then do me the"
7536,ACT I.,"favor to carry your curiosity so far, as to inquire if my servants"
7537,ACT I.,are within.
7538,ACT I.,
7539,ACT I.,"_Landlord._ I shall, Sir. Here, David, Jonathan,--I think I hear them"
7540,ACT I.,"coming,--shall make bold to leave you,"
7541,ACT I.,Sir.                                                     [_Exit._

7553,ACT I.,
7554,ACT I.,_Mr. H._ They have something to say to me. The rascals want their
7555,ACT I.,"wages raised, I suppose; there is always a favor to be asked when"

7639,ACT II.,_3d Lady_. Such an air in all that he does or says--
7640,ACT II.,
7641,ACT II.,_4th Lady_. Yet gifted with a strong understanding--
7642,ACT II.,
7643,ACT II.,_5th Lady_. But has your ladyship the remotest idea of what his true
7644,ACT II.,name is?
7645,ACT II.,
7646,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. They say, his very servants do not know it. His French"
7647,ACT II.,"valet, that has lived with him these two years--"
7648,ACT II.,
7649,ACT II.,"_2d Lady_. There, Madam, I must beg leave to set you right; my"
7650,ACT II.,coachman--
7651,ACT II.,
7652,ACT II.,_1st Lady_. I have it from the very best authority; my footma--
7653,ACT II.,
7654,ACT II.,"_2d Lady_. Then, Madam, you have set your servants on--"
7655,ACT II.,
7656,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. No, Madam, I would scorn any such little mean ways of"
7657,ACT II.,"coming at a secret. For my part, I don't think any secret of that"
7658,ACT II.,consequence.
7659,ACT II.,
7660,ACT II.,_2d Lady_. That's just like me; I make a rule of troubling my head
7661,ACT II.,with nobody's business but my own.
7662,ACT II.,
7663,ACT II.,"_Melesinda_. But then, she takes care to make everybody's business"
7664,ACT II.,"her own, and so to justify herself that way--"
7665,ACT II.,(_Aside_.)
7666,ACT II.,
7667,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. My dear Melesinda, you look thoughtful."
7668,ACT II.,
7669,ACT II.,_Melesinda_. Nothing.
7670,ACT II.,
7671,ACT II.,_2d Lady_. Give it a name.
7672,ACT II.,
7673,ACT II.,_Melesinda_. Perhaps it is nameless.
7674,ACT II.,
7675,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. As the object--Come, never blush, nor deny it, child."
7676,ACT II.,"Bless me, what great ugly thing is that, that dangles at your bosom?"
7677,ACT II.,
7678,ACT II.,_Melesinda_. This? It is a cross: how do you like it?
7679,ACT II.,
7680,ACT II.,"_2d Lady_. A cross! Well, to me it looks for all the world like a"
7681,ACT II.,great staring H. _(Here a general laugh.)_
7682,ACT II.,
7683,ACT II.,"_Melesinda_. Malicious creatures! Believe me it is a cross, and"
7684,ACT II.,nothing but a cross.
7685,ACT II.,
7686,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. A cross, I believe, you would willingly hang at."
7687,ACT II.,
7688,ACT II.,_Melesinda_. Intolerable spite!
7689,ACT II.,
7690,ACT II.,_(MR. H. is announced.)_
7691,ACT II.,
7692,ACT II.,_Enter MR. H._
7693,ACT II.,
7694,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. O, Mr. H., we are so glad--"
7695,ACT II.,
7696,ACT II.,_2d Lady_. We have been so dull--
7697,ACT II.,
7698,ACT II.,_3rd Lady_. So perfectly lifeless--You owe it to us to be more than
7699,ACT II.,commonly entertaining.
7700,ACT II.,
7701,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_. Ladies, this is so obliging--"
7702,ACT II.,
7703,ACT II.,"_4th Lady_. O, Mr. H., those ranunculas you said were dying, pretty"
7704,ACT II.,"things, they have got up--"
7705,ACT II.,
7706,ACT II.,_5th Lady_. I have worked that sprig you commended--I want you to
7707,ACT II.,come--
7708,ACT II.,
7709,ACT II.,_Mr. H_.  Ladies--
7710,ACT II.,
7711,ACT II.,_6th Lady_. I have sent for that piece of music from London.
7712,ACT II.,
7713,ACT II.,_Mr. H_. The Mozart _(seeing MELESINDA)_--Melesinda!
7714,ACT II.,
7715,ACT II.,"_Several Ladies at once_. Nay, positively, Melesinda, you shan't"
7716,ACT II.,engross him all to yourself.
7717,ACT II.,

7719,ACT II.,signs of displeasure_.

7723,ACT II.,
7724,ACT II.,"_2d Gent_. Damn him, I will affront him."
7725,ACT II.,
7726,ACT II.,"_1st Gent_. Sir, with your leave, I have a word to say to one of"
7727,ACT II.,these ladies.
7728,ACT II.,
7729,ACT II.,_2d Gent_. If we could be heard--
7730,ACT II.,
7731,ACT II.,[_The Ladies pay no attention but to MR. H_.
7732,ACT II.,
7733,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_. You see, gentlemen, how the matter stands. _(Hums an air.)_"
7734,ACT II.,I am not my own master: positively I exist and breathe but to be
7735,ACT II.,agreeable to these--Did you speak?
7736,ACT II.,
7737,ACT II.,_1st Gent_. And affects absence of mind--Puppy!
7738,ACT II.,
7739,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_. Who spoke of absence of mind; did you, Madam? How do you do,"
7740,ACT II.,Lady Wearwell--how do? I did not see your ladyship before--what was I
7741,ACT II.,about to say--O--absence of mind. I am the most unhappy dog in that
7742,ACT II.,"way, sometimes spurt out the strangest things--the most"
7743,ACT II.,"mal-à-propos--without meaning to give the least offence, upon my"
7744,ACT II.,honor--sheer absence of mind--things I would have given the world not
7745,ACT II.,to have said.
7746,ACT II.,
7747,ACT II.,_1st Gent_. Do you hear the coxcomb?
7748,ACT II.,
7749,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. Great wits, they say--"
7750,ACT II.,
7751,ACT II.,_2d Lady_. Your fine geniuses are most given--
7752,ACT II.,
7753,ACT II.,_3d Lady_. Men of bright parts are commonly too vivacious--
7754,ACT II.,
7755,ACT II.,_Mr. H_. But you shall hear. I was to dine the other day at a great
7756,ACT II.,"Nabob's that must be nameless, who, between ourselves, is strongly"
7757,ACT II.,"suspected of--being very rich, that's all. John, my valet, who knows"
7758,ACT II.,"my foible, cautioned me, while he was dressing me, as he usually does"
7759,ACT II.,"where he thinks there's a danger of my committing a _lapsus_, to take"
7760,ACT II.,care in my conversation how I made any allusion direct or indirect to
7761,ACT II.,presents--you understand me? I set out double charged with my
7762,ACT II.,"fellow's consideration and my own; and, to do myself justice, behaved"
7763,ACT II.,"with tolerable circumspection for the first half-hour or so,--till at"
7764,ACT II.,"last a gentleman in company, who was indulging a free vein of"
7765,ACT II.,"raillery at the expense of the ladies, stumbled upon that expression"
7766,ACT II.,"of the poet, which calls them ""fair defects."""
7767,ACT II.,
7768,ACT II.,"_1st Lady_. It is Pope, I believe, who says it."
7769,ACT II.,
7770,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_.  No, Madam; Milton. Where was I? Oh, ""fair defects."" This"
7771,ACT II.,"gave occasion to a critic in company, to deliver his opinion on the"
7772,ACT II.,phrase--that led to an enumeration of all the various words which
7773,ACT II.,"might have been used instead of ""defect,"" as want, absence, poverty,"
7774,ACT II.,"deficiency, lack. This moment I, who had not been attending to the"
7775,ACT II.,progress of the argument (as the denouement will show) starting
7776,ACT II.,"suddenly up out of one of my reveries, by some unfortunate connection"
7777,ACT II.,"of ideas, which the last fatal word had excited, the devil put it"
7778,ACT II.,"into my head to turn round to the Nabob, who was sitting next me, and"
7779,ACT II.,in a very marked manner (as it seemed to the company) to put the
7780,ACT II.,"question to him, Pray, sir, what may be the exact value of a lack of"
7781,ACT II.,rupees? You may guess the confusion which followed.
7782,ACT II.,
7783,ACT II.,_1st Lady_. What a distressing circumstance!
7784,ACT II.,
7785,ACT II.,_2d Lady_. To a delicate mind----
7786,ACT II.,
7787,ACT II.,_3d Lady_. How embarrassing----
7788,ACT II.,
7789,ACT II.,"_4th Lady_. I declare, I quite pity you."
7790,ACT II.,
7791,ACT II.,_1st Gent_. Puppy!
7792,ACT II.,
7793,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_. A Baronet at the table, seeing my dilemma, jogged my elbow;"
7794,ACT II.,"and a good-natured Duchess, who does everything with a grace peculiar"
7795,ACT II.,"to herself, trod on my toes at that instant: this brought me to"
7796,ACT II.,"myself, and--covered with blushes, and pitied by all the ladies--I"
7797,ACT II.,withdrew.
7798,ACT II.,
7799,ACT II.,_1st Lady_. How charmingly he tells a story.
7800,ACT II.,
7801,ACT II.,_2nd Lady_. But how distressing!
7802,ACT II.,
7803,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_. Lord Squandercounsel, who is my particular friend, was"
7804,ACT II.,pleased to rally me in his inimitable way upon it next day. I shall
7805,ACT II.,never forget a sensible thing he said on the occasion--speaking of
7806,ACT II.,"absence of mind, my foible--says he, my dear Hogs--"
7807,ACT II.,
7808,ACT II.,_Several Ladies_. Hogs--what--ha--
7809,ACT II.,
7810,ACT II.,_Mr. H_. My dear Hogsflesh--my name--(_here a universal scream_)--O my
7811,ACT II.,cursed unfortunate tongue! H. I mean--where was I?
7812,ACT II.,
7813,ACT II.,_1st Lady_. Filthy--abominable!
7814,ACT II.,
7815,ACT II.,_2nd Lady_. Unutterable!
7816,ACT II.,
7817,ACT II.,_3rd Lady_. Hogs--foh!
7818,ACT II.,
7819,ACT II.,_4th Lady_. Disgusting!
7820,ACT II.,
7821,ACT II.,_5th Lady_. Vile!
7822,ACT II.,
7823,ACT II.,_6th Lady_. Shocking!
7824,ACT II.,
7825,ACT II.,_1st Lady_. Odious!
7826,ACT II.,
7827,ACT II.,_2nd Lady_. Hogs--pah!
7828,ACT II.,
7829,ACT II.,_3rd Lady_. A smelling-bottle--look to Miss Melesinda. Poor thing! it
7830,ACT II.,"is no wonder. You had better keep off from her, Mr. Hogsflesh, and"
7831,ACT II.,not be pressing about her in her circumstances.
7832,ACT II.,
7833,ACT II.,"_1st Gent_. Good time of day to you, Mr.Hogsflesh."
7834,ACT II.,
7835,ACT II.,"_2nd Gent_. The compliments of the season to you, Mr. Hogsflesh."
7836,ACT II.,
7837,ACT II.,_Mr.H_. This is too much--flesh and blood cannot endure it.
7838,ACT II.,
7839,ACT II.,_1st Gent_. What flesh?--hog's-flesh?
7840,ACT II.,
7841,ACT II.,_2nd Gent_. How he sets up his bristles!
7842,ACT II.,
7843,ACT II.,_Mr. H_. Bristles!
7844,ACT II.,
7845,ACT II.,1_st Gent_. He looks as fierce as a hog in armor.
7846,ACT II.,
7847,ACT II.,"_Mr. H_. A hog!--Madam!--(_here he severally accosts the Ladies, who"
7848,ACT II.,by turns repel him_.)
7849,ACT II.,
7850,ACT II.,1_st Lady_. Extremely obliged to you for your attentions; but don't
7851,ACT II.,want a partner.
7852,ACT II.,
7853,ACT II.,2_d Lady_. Greatly flattered by your preference: but believe I shall
7854,ACT II.,remain single.
7855,ACT II.,
7856,ACT II.,3_d Lady_. Shall always acknowledge your politeness; but have no
7857,ACT II.,thoughts of altering my condition.
7858,ACT II.,
7859,ACT II.,4_th Lady_. Always be happy to respect you as a friend; but you must
7860,ACT II.,not look for anything further.
7861,ACT II.,
7862,ACT II.,5_th Lady_. No doubt of your ability to make any woman happy; but
7863,ACT II.,have no thoughts of changing my name.
7864,ACT II.,
7865,ACT II.,"6_th Lady_. Must tell you, Sir, that if, by your insinuations, you"
7866,ACT II.,"think to prevail with me, you have got the wrong sow by the ear. Does"
7867,ACT II.,he think any lady would go to pig with him?
7868,ACT II.,
7869,ACT II.,_Old Lady_. Must beg you to be less particular in your addresses to
7870,ACT II.,"me. Does he take me for a Jew, to long after forbidden meats?"
7871,ACT II.,
7872,ACT II.,_Mr. H_. I shall go mad!--to be refused by old Mother Damnable--she
7873,ACT II.,"that's so old, nobody knows whether she was ever manned or no, but"
7874,ACT II.,passes for a maid by courtesy; her juvenile exploits being beyond the
7875,ACT II.,farthest stretch of tradition!--Old Mother Damnable!

7881,ACT II.,
7882,ACT II.,BELVIL _and another Gentleman_.
7883,ACT II.,
7884,ACT II.,"_Belvil_. Poor Jack, I am really sorry for him. The account which you"
7885,ACT II.,"give me of his mortifying change of reception at the assembly, would"
7886,ACT II.,be highly diverting if it gave me less pain to hear it. With all his
7887,ACT II.,"amusing absurdities, and amongst them not the least, a predominant"
7888,ACT II.,"desire to be thought well of by the fair sex, he has an abundant"
7889,ACT II.,"share of good-nature, and is a man of honor. Notwithstanding all that"
7890,ACT II.,"has happened, Melesinda may do worse than take him yet. But did the"
7891,ACT II.,women resent it so deeply as you say?
7892,ACT II.,
7893,ACT II.,_Gent._ O intolerably--they fled him as fearfully when 'twas once
7894,ACT II.,"blown, as a man would be avoided, who was suddenly discovered to have"
7895,ACT II.,"marks of the plague, and as fast; when before they had been ready to"
7896,ACT II.,devour the foolishest thing he could say.
7897,ACT II.,
7898,ACT II.,_Belvil_ Ha! ha! so frail is the tenure by which these women's
7899,ACT II.,"favorites commonly hold their envied preëminence. Well, I must go"
7900,ACT II.,"find him out and comfort him. I suppose, I shall find him at the inn."
7901,ACT II.,

7909,ACT II.,"squeamish devils, to dislike me for a name, a sound.--Oh my cursed"
7910,ACT II.,"name! that it was something I could be revenged on! if it were alive,"
7911,ACT II.,"that I might tread upon it, or crush it, or pummel it, or kick it, or"

7955,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ He has heard it all.
7956,ACT II.,
7957,ACT II.,"_Landlord._ Your Honor has had some mortification to be sure, as a"

7960,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Pigs!
7961,ACT II.,
7962,ACT II.,"_Landlord._ What then? take old Pry's advice, and never mind it."
7963,ACT II.,"Don't scorch your crackling for 'em, Sir."
7964,ACT II.,
7965,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Scorch my crackling! a queer phrase; but I suppose he don't
7966,ACT II.,mean to affront me.
7967,ACT II.,
7968,ACT II.,_Landlord._ What is done can't be undone; you can't make a silken

7985,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Smoke me!
7986,ACT II.,
7987,ACT II.,"_Landlord._ One of my phrases; never mind my words, Sir, my meaning"
7988,ACT II.,"is good. We all mean the same thing, only you express yourself one"
7989,ACT II.,"way, and I another, that's all. The meaning's the same; it is all"

8010,ACT II.,

8017,ACT II.,"nature, that don't follow--his name don't make him anything, does"
8018,ACT II.,"it? He don't grunt the more for it, nor squeak, that ever I hear; he"
8019,ACT II.,"likes his victuals out of a plate, as other Christians do; you never"
8020,ACT II.,see him go to the trough----
8021,ACT II.,
8022,ACT II.,_Melesinda._ Unfeeling wretch! yet possibly her intentions----

8031,ACT II.,
8032,ACT II.,_Melesinda._ How fortunate that the discovery has been made before it
8033,ACT II.,"was too late! Had I listened to his deceits, and, as the perfidious"
8034,ACT II.,"man had almost persuaded me, precipitated myself into an inextricable"
8035,ACT II.,engagement before----
8036,ACT II.,
8037,ACT II.,_Maid._ No great harm if you had. You'd only have bought a pig in a
8038,ACT II.,"poke--and what then? Oh, here he comes creeping----"
8039,ACT II.,
8040,ACT II.,_Enter_ MR. H. _abject._
8041,ACT II.,
8042,ACT II.,"Go to her, Mr. Hogs--Hogs--Hogsbristles, what's your name? Don't be"
8043,ACT II.,"afraid, man--don't give it up--she's not crying--only _summat_ has"
8044,ACT II.,"made her eyes red--she has got a sty in her eye, I believe----"
8045,ACT II.,_(going.)_
8046,ACT II.,
8047,ACT II.,"_Melesinda._ You are not going, Betty?"
8048,ACT II.,
8049,ACT II.,"_Maid._ O, Madam, never mind me--I shall be back in the twinkling of"
8050,ACT II.,"a pig's whisker, as they say."
8051,ACT II.,
8052,ACT II.,[_Exit._
8053,ACT II.,
8054,ACT II.,"_Mr. H._ Melesinda, you behold before you a wretch who would have"
8055,ACT II.,betrayed your confidence--but it was love that prompted him; who
8056,ACT II.,"would have trick'd you, by an unworthy concealment, into a"
8057,ACT II.,participation of that disgrace which a superficial world has agreed
8058,ACT II.,to attach to a name--but with it you would have shared a fortune not
8059,ACT II.,"contemptible, and a heart--but 'tis over now. That name he is content"
8060,ACT II.,to bear alone--to go where the persecuted syllables shall be no more
8061,ACT II.,"heard, or excite no meaning--some spot where his native tongue has"
8062,ACT II.,"never penetrated, nor any of his countrymen have landed, to plant"
8063,ACT II.,"their unfeeling satire, their brutal wit, and national ill"
8064,ACT II.,"manners--where no Englishmen--(Here_ MELESINDA, _who has been"
8065,ACT II.,"pouting during this speech, fetches a deep sigh.)_ Some yet"
8066,ACT II.,"undiscovered Otaheite, where witless, unapprehensive savages shall"
8067,ACT II.,"innocently pronounce the ill-fated sounds, and think them not"
8068,ACT II.,inharmonious.
8069,ACT II.,
8070,ACT II.,_Melesinda._ Oh!
8071,ACT II.,
8072,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Who knows but among the female natives might be found----
8073,ACT II.,
8074,ACT II.,_Melesinda._ Sir! (_raising her head._)
8075,ACT II.,
8076,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ One who would be more kind than--some Oberea--Queen Oberea.
8077,ACT II.,
8078,ACT II.,_Melesinda._ Oh!
8079,ACT II.,
8080,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Or what if I were to seek for proofs of reciprocal esteem
8081,ACT II.,"among unprejudiced African maids, in Monomotopa?"
8082,ACT II.,
8083,ACT II.,_Enter Servant._
8084,ACT II.,
8085,ACT II.,_Servant._ Mr. Belvil.                             [_Exit._
8086,ACT II.,
8087,ACT II.,_Enter_ BELVIL.
8088,ACT II.,
8089,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Monomotopa (_musing._)
8090,ACT II.,
8091,ACT II.,"_Belvil._ Heyday, Jack! what means this mortified face? nothing has"
8092,ACT II.,"happened, I hope, between this lady and you? I beg pardon, Madam, but"
8093,ACT II.,"understanding my friend was with you, I took the liberty of seeking"
8094,ACT II.,him here. Some little difference possibly which a third person can
8095,ACT II.,"adjust--not a word. Will you, Madam, as this gentleman's friend,"
8096,ACT II.,"suffer me to be the arbitrator--strange--hark'ee, Jack, nothing has"
8097,ACT II.,"come out, has there? you understand me. Oh, I guess how it"
8098,ACT II.,"is--somebody has got at your secret; you haven't blabbed it yourself,"
8099,ACT II.,"have you? ha! ha! ha! I could find in my heart--Jack, what would you"
8100,ACT II.,give me if I should relieve you?
8101,ACT II.,
8102,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ No power of man can relieve me (_sighs_); but it must lie at
8103,ACT II.,"the root, gnawing at the root--here it will lie."
8104,ACT II.,
8105,ACT II.,"_Belvil._ No power of man? not a common man, I grant you: for"
8106,ACT II.,"instance, a subject--it's out of the power of any subject."
8107,ACT II.,
8108,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Gnawing at the root--there it will lie.
8109,ACT II.,
8110,ACT II.,_Belvil._ Such a thing has been known as a name to be changed; but
8111,ACT II.,not by a subject--(_shows a Gazette_).
8112,ACT II.,
8113,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ Gnawing at the root--(_suddenly snatches the paper out of_
8114,ACT II.,BELVIL'S _hand_)--ha! pish! nonsense! give it me--what! (_reads_)
8115,ACT II.,"promotions, bankrupts--a great many bankrupts this week--there it"
8116,ACT II.,"will lie. (_Lays it down, takes it up again, and reads._) ""The King"
8117,ACT II.,"has been graciously pleased""--gnawing at the root--""graciously"
8118,ACT II.,"pleased to grant unto John Hogsflesh,""--the devil--""Hogsflesh, Esq.,"
8119,ACT II.,"of Sty Hall, in the county of Hants, his royal license and"
8120,ACT II.,"authority""--O Lord! O Lord!--""that he and his issue""--me and my"

8124,ACT II.,"uncle, as well as out of grateful respect to his memory:""--grateful"

8128,ACT II.,"Office."""
8129,ACT II.,
8130,ACT II.,"_Belvil._ Come, Madam, give me leave to put my own interpretation"
8131,ACT II.,"upon your silence, and to plead for my friend, that now that only"
8132,ACT II.,"obstacle which seemed to stand in the way of your union is removed,"
8133,ACT II.,you will suffer me to complete the happiness which my news seems to
8134,ACT II.,"have brought him, by introducing him with a new claim to your favor,"
8135,ACT II.,"by the name of Mr. Bacon. (_Takes their hands and joins them, which_"
8136,ACT II.,MELESINDA _seems to give consent to with a smile._)
8137,ACT II.,
8138,ACT II.,"_Mr. H._ Generous Melesinda! my dear friend--""he and his issue,"" me"
8139,ACT II.,and my issue!--O Lord!--
8140,ACT II.,
8141,ACT II.,"_Belvil._ I wish you joy, Jack, with all my heart."
8142,ACT II.,
8143,ACT II.,"_Mr. H._ Bacon, Bacon, Bacon--how odd it sounds! I could never be"
8144,ACT II.,tired of hearing it. There was Lord Chancellor Bacon. Methinks I have
8145,ACT II.,some of the Verulam blood in me already.--Methinks I could look
8146,ACT II.,"through Nature--there was Friar Bacon, a conjurer,--I feel as if I"
8147,ACT II.,could conjure too----
8148,ACT II.,
8149,ACT II.,_Enter a Servant._
8150,ACT II.,
8151,ACT II.,"_Servant._ Two young ladies and an old lady are at the door,"
8152,ACT II.,"inquiring if you see company, Madam."
8153,ACT II.,
8154,ACT II.,"_Mr. H._ ""Surname and arms""--"
8155,ACT II.,
8156,ACT II.,"_Melesinda._ Show them up.--My dear Mr. Bacon, moderate your joy."
8157,ACT II.,
8158,ACT II.,"_Enter three Ladies, being part of those who were at the Assembly._"
8159,ACT II.,
8160,ACT II.,"_1st Lady._ My dear Melesinda, how do you do?"
8161,ACT II.,
8162,ACT II.,_2nd Lady._ How do you do? We have been so concerned for you----
8163,ACT II.,
8164,ACT II.,_Old Lady._ We have been so concerned--(_seeing him_)--Mr.
8165,ACT II.,Hogsflesh----
8166,ACT II.,
8167,ACT II.,_Mr. H._ There's no such person--nor there never was--nor 'tis not
8168,ACT II.,"fit there should be--""surname and arms""--"
8169,ACT II.,
8170,ACT II.,_Belvil._ It is true what my friend would express; we have been all
8171,ACT II.,"in a mistake, ladies. Very true, the name of this gentleman was what"
8172,ACT II.,"you call it, but it is so no longer. The succession to the"
8173,ACT II.,"long-contested Bacon estate is at length decided, and with it my"
8174,ACT II.,friend succeeds to the name of his deceased relative.
8175,ACT II.,
8176,ACT II.,"_Mr. H._ ""His Majesty has been graciously pleased""--"
8177,ACT II.,
8178,ACT II.,_1st Lady._ I am sure we all join in hearty
8179,ACT II.,congratulation--_(sighs)._
8180,ACT II.,
8181,ACT II.,_2nd Lady._ And wish you joy with all our hearts--_(heigh ho!)_
8182,ACT II.,
8183,ACT II.,_Old Lady._ And hope you will enjoy the name and estate many
8184,ACT II.,years--_(cries)._
8185,ACT II.,
8186,ACT II.,"_Belvil._ Ha! ha! ha! mortify them a little, Jack."
8187,ACT II.,
8188,ACT II.,_1st Lady._ Hope you intend to stay--
8189,ACT II.,
8190,ACT II.,_2nd Lady._ With us some time--
8191,ACT II.,
8192,ACT II.,_Old Lady._ In these parts--
8193,ACT II.,
8194,ACT II.,"_Mr. H._ Ladies, for your congratulations I thank you; for the favors"
8195,ACT II.,"you have lavished on me, and in particular for this lady's _(turning"
8196,ACT II.,"to the old Lady)_ good opinion, I rest your debtor. As to any future"
8197,ACT II.,favors--_(accosts them severally in the order in which he was refused
8198,ACT II.,"by them at the assembly)_--Madam, shall always acknowledge your"
8199,ACT II.,"politeness; but at present, you see, I am engaged with a partner."
8200,ACT II.,"Always be happy to respect you as a friend, but you must not look for"
8201,ACT II.,anything further. Must beg of you to be less particular in your
8202,ACT II.,"addresses to me. Ladies all, with this piece of advice, of Bath and"
8203,ACT II.,you
8204,ACT II.,
8205,ACT II.,Your ever grateful servant takes his leave.
8206,ACT II.,Lay your plans surer when you plot to grieve;
8207,ACT II.,"See, while you kindly mean to mortify"
8208,ACT II.,"Another, the wild arrow do not fly,"
8209,ACT II.,And gall yourself. For once you've been mistaken;
8210,ACT II.,Your shafts have miss'd their aim--Hogsflesh has
8211,ACT II.,saved his Bacon.

8404,THE THREE FRIENDS.,THE THREE FRIENDS.
8405,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8406,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Three young maids in friendship met;
8407,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Mary, Martha, Margaret."
8408,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Margaret was tall and fair,"
8409,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Martha shorter by a hair;
8410,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"If the first excell'd in feature,"
8411,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Th' other's grace and ease were greater;
8412,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Mary, though to rival loth,"
8413,THE THREE FRIENDS.,In their best gifts equall'd both.
8414,THE THREE FRIENDS.,They a due proportion kept;
8415,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Martha mourn'd if Margaret wept;
8416,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Margaret joy'd when any good
8417,THE THREE FRIENDS.,She of Martha understood;
8418,THE THREE FRIENDS.,And in sympathy for either
8419,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Mary was outdone by neither.
8420,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Thus far, for a happy space,"
8421,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All three ran an equal race,"
8422,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"A most constant friendship proving,"
8423,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Equally beloved and loving;
8424,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All their wishes, joys, the same;"
8425,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Sisters only not in name.
8426,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8427,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Fortune upon each one smiled,"
8428,THE THREE FRIENDS.,As upon a fav'rite child;
8429,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Well to do and well to see
8430,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Were the parents of all three;
8431,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Till on Martha's father crosses
8432,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Brought a flood of worldly losses,"
8433,THE THREE FRIENDS.,And his fortunes rich and great
8434,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Changed at once to low estate:
8435,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Under which o'erwhelming blow
8436,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Martha's mother was laid low;
8437,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She a hapless orphan left,"
8438,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of maternal care bereft,"
8439,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Trouble following trouble fast,"
8440,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Lay in a sick-bed at last.
8441,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8442,THE THREE FRIENDS.,In the depth of her affliction
8443,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Martha now receiv'd conviction,"
8444,THE THREE FRIENDS.,That a true and faithful friend
8445,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Can the surest comfort lend.
8446,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Night and day, with friendship tried,"
8447,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Ever constant by her side
8448,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Was her gentle Mary found,"
8449,THE THREE FRIENDS.,With a love that knew no bound;
8450,THE THREE FRIENDS.,And the solace she imparted
8451,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Saved her dying broken-hearted.
8452,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8453,THE THREE FRIENDS.,In this scene of earthly things
8454,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Not one good unmixèd springs.
8455,THE THREE FRIENDS.,That which had to Martha proved
8456,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"A sweet consolation, moved"
8457,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Different feelings of regret
8458,THE THREE FRIENDS.,In the mind of Margaret.
8459,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She, whose love was not less dear,"
8460,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Nor affection less sincere
8461,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"To her friend, was, by occasion"
8462,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of more distant habitation,"
8463,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Fewer visits forced to pay her;
8464,THE THREE FRIENDS.,When no other cause did stay her;
8465,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And her Mary living nearer,"
8466,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Margaret began to fear her,"
8467,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Lest her visits day by day
8468,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Martha's heart should steal away.
8469,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"That whole heart she ill could spare her,"
8470,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Where till now she'd been a sharer.
8471,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"From this cause with grief she pined,"
8472,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Till at length her health declined.
8473,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All her cheerful spirits flew,"
8474,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Fast as Martha's gather'd new;
8475,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And her sickness waxèd sore,"
8476,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Just when Martha felt no more.
8477,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8478,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Mary, who had quick suspicion"
8479,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of her alter'd friend's condition,"
8480,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Seeing Martha's convalescence
8481,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Less demanded now her presence,"
8482,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"With a goodness, built on reason,"
8483,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Changed her measures with the season;
8484,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Turn'd her steps from Martha's door,"
8485,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Went where she was wanted more;
8486,THE THREE FRIENDS.,All her care and thoughts were set
8487,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Now to tend on Margaret.
8488,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Mary living 'twixt the two,"
8489,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"From her home could oft'ner go,"
8490,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Either of her friends to see,"
8491,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Than they could together be.
8492,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8493,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Truth explain'd is to suspicion
8494,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Evermore the best physician.
8495,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Soon her visits had the effect;
8496,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All that Margaret did suspect,"
8497,THE THREE FRIENDS.,From her fancy vanish'd clean;
8498,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She was soon what she had been,"
8499,THE THREE FRIENDS.,And the color she did lack
8500,THE THREE FRIENDS.,To her faded cheek came back.
8501,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Wounds which love had made her feel,"
8502,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Love alone had power to heal.
8503,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8504,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Martha, who the frequent visit"
8505,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Now had lost, and sore did miss it,"
8506,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"With impatience waxèd cross,"
8507,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Counted Margaret's gain her loss:
8508,THE THREE FRIENDS.,All that Mary did confer
8509,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"On her friend, thought due to her."
8510,THE THREE FRIENDS.,In her girlish bosom rise
8511,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Little foolish jealousies,"
8512,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Which into such rancor wrought,"
8513,THE THREE FRIENDS.,She one day for Margaret sought;
8514,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Finding her by chance alone,"
8515,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She began, with reasons shown,"
8516,THE THREE FRIENDS.,To insinuate a fear
8517,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Whether Mary was sincere;
8518,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Wish'd that Margaret would take heed
8519,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Whence her actions did proceed.
8520,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"For herself, she'd long been minded"
8521,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Not with outsides to be blinded;
8522,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All that pity and compassion,"
8523,THE THREE FRIENDS.,She believed was affectation;
8524,THE THREE FRIENDS.,In her heart she doubted whether
8525,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Mary cared a pin for either.
8526,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She could keep whole weeks at distance,"
8527,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And not know of their existence,"
8528,THE THREE FRIENDS.,While all things remain'd the same;
8529,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"But, when some misfortune came,"
8530,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Then she made a great parade
8531,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of her sympathy and aid,--"
8532,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Not that she did really grieve,"
8533,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"It was only _make-believe_,"
8534,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And she cared for nothing, so"
8535,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She might her fine feelings show,"
8536,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And get credit, on her part,"
8537,THE THREE FRIENDS.,For a soft and tender heart.
8538,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8539,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"With such speeches, smoothly made,"
8540,THE THREE FRIENDS.,She found methods to persuade
8541,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Margaret (who being sore
8542,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"From the doubts she'd felt before,"
8543,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Was preparèd for mistrust)
8544,THE THREE FRIENDS.,To believe her reasons just;
8545,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Quite destroy'd that comfort glad,"
8546,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Which in Mary late she had;
8547,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Made her, in experience' spite,"
8548,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Think her friend a hypocrite,"
8549,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And resolve, with cruel scoff,"
8550,THE THREE FRIENDS.,To renounce and cast her off.
8551,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8552,THE THREE FRIENDS.,See how good turns are rewarded!
8553,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She of both is now discarded,"
8554,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Who to both had been so late
8555,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Their support in low estate,"
8556,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All their comfort, and their stay--"
8557,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Now of both is cast away.
8558,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"But the league her presence cherish'd,"
8559,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Losing its best prop, soon perish'd;"
8560,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She, that was a link to either,"
8561,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"To keep them and it together,"
8562,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Being gone, the two (no wonder)"
8563,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"That were left, soon fell asunder;--"
8564,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Some civilities were kept,"
8565,THE THREE FRIENDS.,But the heart of friendship slept;
8566,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Love with hollow forms was fed,"
8567,THE THREE FRIENDS.,But the life of love lay dead:--
8568,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"A cold intercourse they held,"
8569,THE THREE FRIENDS.,After Mary was expell'd.
8570,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8571,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Two long years did intervene
8572,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Since they'd either of them seen,"
8573,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Or, by letter, any word"
8574,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of their old companion heard,--"
8575,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"When, upon a day once walking,"
8576,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of indifferent matters talking,"
8577,THE THREE FRIENDS.,They a female figure met;
8578,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Martha said to Margaret,"
8579,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"""That young maid in face does carry"
8580,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"A resemblance strong of Mary."""
8581,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Margaret, at nearer sight,"
8582,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Own'd her observation right;
8583,THE THREE FRIENDS.,But they did not far proceed
8584,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Ere they knew 'twas she indeed.
8585,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She--but, ah I how changed they view her"
8586,THE THREE FRIENDS.,From that person which they knew her!
8587,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Her fine face disease had scarr'd,"
8588,THE THREE FRIENDS.,And its matchless beauty marr'd:--
8589,THE THREE FRIENDS.,But enough was left to trace
8590,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Mary's sweetness--Mary's grace.
8591,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"When her eye did first behold them,"
8592,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"How they blush'd!--but, when she told them,"
8593,THE THREE FRIENDS.,How on a sick-bed she lay
8594,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Months, while they had kept away,"
8595,THE THREE FRIENDS.,And had no inquiries made
8596,THE THREE FRIENDS.,If she were alive or dead;--
8597,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"How, for want of a true friend,"
8598,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"She was brought near to her end,"
8599,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"And was like so to have died,"
8600,THE THREE FRIENDS.,With no friend at her bedside;--
8601,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"How the constant irritation,"
8602,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Caused by fruitless expectation
8603,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Of their coming, had extended"
8604,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"The illness, when she might have mended,--"
8605,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Then, O then, how did reflection"
8606,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Come on them with recollection!
8607,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"All that she had done for them,"
8608,THE THREE FRIENDS.,How it did their fault condemn!
8609,THE THREE FRIENDS.,
8610,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"But sweet Mary, still the same,"
8611,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Kindly eased them of their shame;
8612,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Spoke to them with accents bland,"
8613,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Took them friendly by the hand;
8614,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Bound them both with promise fast.
8615,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Not to speak of troubles past;
8616,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Made them on the spot declare
8617,THE THREE FRIENDS.,A new league of friendship there;
8618,THE THREE FRIENDS.,"Which, without a word of strife,"
8619,THE THREE FRIENDS.,Lasted thenceforth long as life.

9901,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Fran_. Take care of Martin, he'll topple off his seat else."
9902,ACT THE FIRST.,[MARTIN _drops asleep_.
9903,ACT THE FIRST.,
9904,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Peter_. Times are greatly altered, since young master took upon"
9905,ACT THE FIRST.,himself the government of this household.
9906,ACT THE FIRST.,
9907,ACT THE FIRST.,_All_. Greatly altered.
9908,ACT THE FIRST.,
9909,ACT THE FIRST.,_Fran_. I think everything be altered for the better since His
9910,ACT THE FIRST.,Majesty's blessed restoration.
9911,ACT THE FIRST.,
9912,ACT THE FIRST.,_Peter_. In Sir Walter's days there was no encouragement given to
9913,ACT THE FIRST.,good housekeeping.
9914,ACT THE FIRST.,
9915,ACT THE FIRST.,_All_. None.
9916,ACT THE FIRST.,
9917,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Dan_. For instance, no possibility of getting drunk before two in"
9918,ACT THE FIRST.,the afternoon.
9919,ACT THE FIRST.,
9920,ACT THE FIRST.,_Peter_. Every man his allowance of ale at breakfast--his quart!
9921,ACT THE FIRST.,
9922,ACT THE FIRST.,_All_. A quart!!                             [_In derision._
9923,ACT THE FIRST.,
9924,ACT THE FIRST.,_Dan_. Nothing left to our own sweet discretions.
9925,ACT THE FIRST.,
9926,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Peter_. Whereby it may appear, we were treated more like beasts than"
9927,ACT THE FIRST.,what we were--discreet and reasonable serving-men.
9928,ACT THE FIRST.,
9929,ACT THE FIRST.,_All_. Like beasts.
9930,ACT THE FIRST.,
9931,ACT THE FIRST.,_Mar_. (_Opening his eyes_.) Like beasts.
9932,ACT THE FIRST.,
9933,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Dan_. To sleep, wagtail!"
9934,ACT THE FIRST.,
9935,ACT THE FIRST.,_Fran_. I marvel all this while where the old gentleman has found
9936,ACT THE FIRST.,means to secrete himself. It seems no man has heard of him since the
9937,ACT THE FIRST.,"day of the King's return. Can any tell why our young master, being"
9938,ACT THE FIRST.,"favored by the court, should not have interest to procure his"
9939,ACT THE FIRST.,father's pardon?
9940,ACT THE FIRST.,
9941,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Dan_. Marry, I think 'tis the obstinacy of the old knight, that will"
9942,ACT THE FIRST.,not be beholden to the court for his safety.
9943,ACT THE FIRST.,
9944,ACT THE FIRST.,_Mar_. Now that is wilful.
9945,ACT THE FIRST.,
9946,ACT THE FIRST.,_Fran_. But can any tell me the place of his concealment?
9947,ACT THE FIRST.,
9948,ACT THE FIRST.,_Peter_. That cannot I; but I have my conjectures.
9949,ACT THE FIRST.,
9950,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Dan_. Two hundred pounds, as I hear, to the man that shall apprehend"
9951,ACT THE FIRST.,him.
9952,ACT THE FIRST.,
9953,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Fran_. Well, I have my suspicions."
9954,ACT THE FIRST.,
9955,ACT THE FIRST.,_Peter_. And so have I.
9956,ACT THE FIRST.,
9957,ACT THE FIRST.,_Mar_. And I can keep a secret.
9958,ACT THE FIRST.,
9959,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Fran_. (_to PETER_.) Warwickshire, you mean.  [_Aside._"
9960,ACT THE FIRST.,
9961,ACT THE FIRST.,_Peter_. Perhaps not.
9962,ACT THE FIRST.,
9963,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Fran_. Nearer, perhaps."
9964,ACT THE FIRST.,
9965,ACT THE FIRST.,_Peter_. I say nothing.
9966,ACT THE FIRST.,
9967,ACT THE FIRST.,_Dan_. I hope there is none in this company would be mean enough to
9968,ACT THE FIRST.,betray him.
9969,ACT THE FIRST.,
9970,ACT THE FIRST.,"_All_. O Lord, surely not."
9971,ACT THE FIRST.,
9972,ACT THE FIRST.,[_They drink to_ SIR WALTER'S _safety_.
9973,ACT THE FIRST.,
9974,ACT THE FIRST.,_Fran_. I have often wondered how our master came to be excepted by
9975,ACT THE FIRST.,name in the late Act of Oblivion.
9976,ACT THE FIRST.,
9977,ACT THE FIRST.,_Dan_. Shall I tell the reason?
9978,ACT THE FIRST.,
9979,ACT THE FIRST.,"_All_. Ay, do."
9980,ACT THE FIRST.,
9981,ACT THE FIRST.,_Dan_. 'Tis thought he is no great friend to the present happy
9982,ACT THE FIRST.,establishment.
9983,ACT THE FIRST.,
9984,ACT THE FIRST.,_All_. O! monstrous!
9985,ACT THE FIRST.,
9986,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Peter_. Fellow-servants, a thought strikes me.--Do we, or do we not,"
9987,ACT THE FIRST.,"come under the penalties of the treason-act, by reason of our being"
9988,ACT THE FIRST.,privy to this man's concealment?
9989,ACT THE FIRST.,
9990,ACT THE FIRST.,_All_. Truly a sad consideration.
9991,ACT THE FIRST.,
9992,ACT THE FIRST.,[_To them enters_ SANDFORD _suddenly_.
9993,ACT THE FIRST.,
9994,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Sand_. You well-fed and unprofitable grooms,"
9995,ACT THE FIRST.,"Maintain'd for state, not use;"
9996,ACT THE FIRST.,"You lazy feasters at another's cost,"
9997,ACT THE FIRST.,"That eat like maggots into an estate,"
9998,ACT THE FIRST.,And do as little work.
9999,ACT THE FIRST.,"Being indeed but foul excrescences,"
10000,ACT THE FIRST.,And no just parts in a well-order'd family;
10001,ACT THE FIRST.,"You base and rascal imitators,"
10002,ACT THE FIRST.,"Who act up to the height your master's vices,"
10003,ACT THE FIRST.,But cannot read his virtues in your bond:
10004,ACT THE FIRST.,"Which of you, as I enter'd, spake of betraying?"
10005,ACT THE FIRST.,"Was it you, or you, or thin-face, was it you?"
10006,ACT THE FIRST.,
10007,ACT THE FIRST.,_Mar_. Whom does he call thin-face?
10008,ACT THE FIRST.,
10009,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Sand_. No prating, loon, but tell me who he was,"
10010,ACT THE FIRST.,"That I may brain the villain with my staff,"
10011,ACT THE FIRST.,That seeks Sir Walter's life!
10012,ACT THE FIRST.,"You miserable men,"
10013,ACT THE FIRST.,"With minds more slavish than your slave's estate,"
10014,ACT THE FIRST.,"Have you that noble bounty so forgot,"
10015,ACT THE FIRST.,"Which took you from the looms, and from the ploughs,"
10016,ACT THE FIRST.,"Which better had ye follow'd, fed ye, clothed ye,"
10017,ACT THE FIRST.,"And entertain'd ye in a worthy service,"
10018,ACT THE FIRST.,"Where your best wages was the world's repute,"
10019,ACT THE FIRST.,"That thus ye seek his life, by whom ye live."
10020,ACT THE FIRST.,"Have you forgot, too,"
10021,ACT THE FIRST.,How often in old times
10022,ACT THE FIRST.,"Your drunken mirths have stunn'd day's sober ears,"
10023,ACT THE FIRST.,Carousing full cups to Sir Walter's health?--
10024,ACT THE FIRST.,"Whom now ye would betray, but that he lies"
10025,ACT THE FIRST.,Out of the reach of your poor treacheries.
10026,ACT THE FIRST.,"This learn from me,"
10027,ACT THE FIRST.,"Our master's secret sleeps with trustier tongues,"
10028,ACT THE FIRST.,Than will unlock themselves to carls like you.
10029,ACT THE FIRST.,"Go, get you gone, you knaves. Who stirs? this staff"
10030,ACT THE FIRST.,Shall teach you better manners else.
10031,ACT THE FIRST.,
10032,ACT THE FIRST.,"_All_. Well, we are going."
10033,ACT THE FIRST.,
10034,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Sand_. And quickly too, ye had better, for I see"
10035,ACT THE FIRST.,Young Mistress Margaret coming this way.
10036,ACT THE FIRST.,
10037,ACT THE FIRST.,[_Exeunt all but_ SANDFORD
10038,ACT THE FIRST.,
10039,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Enter_ MARGARET, _as in a fright, pursued by a Gentleman, who,"
10040,ACT THE FIRST.,"seeing_ SANDFORD, _retires muttering a curse_."
10041,ACT THE FIRST.,
10042,ACT THE FIRST.,_Sand_. Good-morrow to my fair mistress. 'Twas a chance
10043,ACT THE FIRST.,"I saw you, lady, so intent was I"
10044,ACT THE FIRST.,"On chiding hence these graceless serving-men,"
10045,ACT THE FIRST.,Who cannot break their fast at morning meals
10046,ACT THE FIRST.,Without debauch and mistimed riotings.
10047,ACT THE FIRST.,This house hath been a scene of nothing else
10048,ACT THE FIRST.,"But atheist riot and profane excess,"
10049,ACT THE FIRST.,Since my old master quitted all his rights here.
10050,ACT THE FIRST.,
10051,ACT THE FIRST.,_Marg_. Each day I endure fresh insult from the scorn
10052,ACT THE FIRST.,"Of Woodvil's friends, the uncivil jests"
10053,ACT THE FIRST.,And free discourses of the dissolute men
10054,ACT THE FIRST.,"That haunt this mansion, making me their mirth."
10055,ACT THE FIRST.,
10056,ACT THE FIRST.,_Sand_. Does my young master know of these affronts?
10057,ACT THE FIRST.,
10058,ACT THE FIRST.,_Marg_. I cannot tell. Perhaps he has not been told.
10059,ACT THE FIRST.,Perhaps he might have seen them if he would.
10060,ACT THE FIRST.,I have known him more quick-sighted. Let that pass.
10061,ACT THE FIRST.,"All things seem changed, I think. I had a friend,"
10062,ACT THE FIRST.,"(I can't but weep to think him alter'd too,)"
10063,ACT THE FIRST.,These things are best forgotten; but I knew
10064,ACT THE FIRST.,"A man, a young man, young, and full of honor,"
10065,ACT THE FIRST.,"That would have pick'd a quarrel for a straw,"
10066,ACT THE FIRST.,"And fought it out to the extremity,"
10067,ACT THE FIRST.,"E'en with the dearest friend he had alive,"
10068,ACT THE FIRST.,"On but a bare surmise, a possibility,"
10069,ACT THE FIRST.,That Margaret had suffer'd an affront.
10070,ACT THE FIRST.,"Some are too tame, that were too splenetic once."
10071,ACT THE FIRST.,
10072,ACT THE FIRST.,_Sand_. 'Twere best he should be _told_ of these affronts.
10073,ACT THE FIRST.,
10074,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Marg_. I am the daughter of his father's friend,"
10075,ACT THE FIRST.,Sir Walter's orphan ward.
10076,ACT THE FIRST.,"I am not his servant-maid, that I should wait"
10077,ACT THE FIRST.,The opportunity of a gracious hearing.
10078,ACT THE FIRST.,Enquire the times and seasons when to put
10079,ACT THE FIRST.,"My peevish prayer up at young Woodvil's feet,"
10080,ACT THE FIRST.,"And sue to him for slow redress, who was"
10081,ACT THE FIRST.,Himself a suitor late to Margaret.
10082,ACT THE FIRST.,I am somewhat proud: and Woodvil taught me pride.
10083,ACT THE FIRST.,"I was his favorite once, his playfellow in infancy,"
10084,ACT THE FIRST.,And joyful mistress of his youth.
10085,ACT THE FIRST.,None once so pleasant in his eyes as Margaret.
10086,ACT THE FIRST.,"His conscience, his religion, Margaret was,"
10087,ACT THE FIRST.,"His dear heart's confessor, a heart within that heart,"
10088,ACT THE FIRST.,And all dear things summ'd up in her alone.
10089,ACT THE FIRST.,As Margaret smil'd or frown'd John liv'd or died;
10090,ACT THE FIRST.,"His dress, speech, gesture, studies, friendships, all"
10091,ACT THE FIRST.,Being fashion'd to her liking.
10092,ACT THE FIRST.,"His flatteries taught me first this self-esteem,"
10093,ACT THE FIRST.,"His flatteries and caresses, while he loved."
10094,ACT THE FIRST.,"The world esteem'd her happy, who had won"
10095,ACT THE FIRST.,"His heart, who won all hearts;"
10096,ACT THE FIRST.,And ladies envied me the love of Woodvil.
10097,ACT THE FIRST.,
10098,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Sand_. He doth affect the courtier's life too much,"
10099,ACT THE FIRST.,"Whose art is to forget,"
10100,ACT THE FIRST.,"And that has wrought this seeming change in him,"
10101,ACT THE FIRST.,That was by nature noble.
10102,ACT THE FIRST.,"'Tis these court-plagues, that swarm about our house,"
10103,ACT THE FIRST.,"Have done the mischief, making his fancy giddy"

10105,ACT THE FIRST.,Tainting his generous spirits with ambition.
10106,ACT THE FIRST.,
10107,ACT THE FIRST.,_Marg_. I know not how it is;
10108,ACT THE FIRST.,A cold protector is John grown to me.
10109,ACT THE FIRST.,"The mistress, and presumptive wife, of Woodvil"
10110,ACT THE FIRST.,Can never stoop so low to supplicate
10111,ACT THE FIRST.,"A man, her equal, to redress those wrongs,"
10112,ACT THE FIRST.,Which he was bound first to prevent;
10113,ACT THE FIRST.,"But which his own neglects have sanctioned rather,"
10114,ACT THE FIRST.,"Both sancion'd and provok'd: a mark'd neglect,"
10115,ACT THE FIRST.,"And strangeness fastening bitter on his love,"
10116,ACT THE FIRST.,"His love, which long has been upon the wane."
10117,ACT THE FIRST.,"For me, I am determined what to do:"
10118,ACT THE FIRST.,"To leave this house this night, and lukewarm John,"
10119,ACT THE FIRST.,And trust for food to the earth and Providence.
10120,ACT THE FIRST.,
10121,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Sand_. O lady, have a care"
10122,ACT THE FIRST.,Of these indefinite and spleen-bred resolves.
10123,ACT THE FIRST.,You know not half the dangers that attend
10124,ACT THE FIRST.,"Upon a life of wand'ring, which your thoughts now,"
10125,ACT THE FIRST.,"Feeling the swellings of a lofty anger,"
10126,ACT THE FIRST.,"To your abused fancy, as 'tis likely,"
10127,ACT THE FIRST.,"Portray without its terrors, painting _lies_"
10128,ACT THE FIRST.,And representments of fallacious liberty;--
10129,ACT THE FIRST.,You know not what it is to leave the roof that shelters you.
10130,ACT THE FIRST.,
10131,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Marg_. I have thought on every possible event,"
10132,ACT THE FIRST.,"The dangers and discouragements you speak of,"
10133,ACT THE FIRST.,"Even till my woman's heart hath ceased to fear them,"
10134,ACT THE FIRST.,And cowardice grows enamor'd of rare accidents;
10135,ACT THE FIRST.,"Nor am I so unfurnish'd, as you think,"
10136,ACT THE FIRST.,Of practicable schemes.
10137,ACT THE FIRST.,
10138,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Sand_. Now God forbid; think twice of this, dear lady."
10139,ACT THE FIRST.,
10140,ACT THE FIRST.,"_Marg_. I pray you spare me, Mr. Sandford."
10141,ACT THE FIRST.,"And once for all believe, nothing can shake my purpose."
10142,ACT THE FIRST.,
10143,ACT THE FIRST.,_Sand_. But what course have you thought on?
10144,ACT THE FIRST.,
10145,ACT THE FIRST.,_Marg_. To seek Sir Walter in the forest of Sherwood.
10146,ACT THE FIRST.,"I have letters from young Simon,"
10147,ACT THE FIRST.,Acquainting me with all the circumstances
10148,ACT THE FIRST.,"Of their concealment, place, and manner of life,"
10149,ACT THE FIRST.,And the merry hours they spend in the green haunts
10150,ACT THE FIRST.,"Of Sherwood, nigh which place they have ta'en a house"
10151,ACT THE FIRST.,"In the town of Nottingham, and pass for foreigners,"
10152,ACT THE FIRST.,Wearing the dress of Frenchmen.--
10153,ACT THE FIRST.,All which I have perused with so attent
10154,ACT THE FIRST.,"And child-like longings, that to my doting ears"
10155,ACT THE FIRST.,"Two sounds now seem like one,"
10156,ACT THE FIRST.,"One meaning in two words, Sherwood and Liberty."
10157,ACT THE FIRST.,"And, gentle Mr. Sandford,"
10158,ACT THE FIRST.,'Tis you that must provide now
10159,ACT THE FIRST.,"The means of my departure, which for safety"
10160,ACT THE FIRST.,Must be in boy's apparel.
10161,ACT THE FIRST.,
10162,ACT THE FIRST.,_Sand_. Since you will have it so
10163,ACT THE FIRST.,"(My careful age trembles at all may happen),"
10164,ACT THE FIRST.,I will engage to furnish you.
10165,ACT THE FIRST.,"I have the keys of the wardrobe, and can fit you"
10166,ACT THE FIRST.,With garments to your size.
10167,ACT THE FIRST.,I know a suit
10168,ACT THE FIRST.,"Of lively Lincoln green, that shall much grace you"
10169,ACT THE FIRST.,"In the wear, being glossy fresh, and worn but seldom."
10170,ACT THE FIRST.,Young Stephen Woodvil wore them while he lived.
10171,ACT THE FIRST.,"I have the keys of all this house and passages,"
10172,ACT THE FIRST.,And ere daybreak will rise and let you forth.
10173,ACT THE FIRST.,What things soe'er you have need of I can furnish you;
10174,ACT THE FIRST.,"And will provide a horse and trusty guide,"
10175,ACT THE FIRST.,To bear you on your way to Nottingham.
10176,ACT THE FIRST.,
10177,ACT THE FIRST.,_Marg_. That once this day and night were fairly past!
10178,ACT THE FIRST.,For then I'll bid this house and love farewell;
10179,ACT THE FIRST.,"Farewell, sweet Devon; farewell, lukewarm John;"

10734,ACT THE THIRD.,
10735,ACT THE THIRD.,"JOHN WOODVIL, LOVEL, GRAY, _and four more_."
10736,ACT THE THIRD.,
10737,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. More mirth, I beseech you, gentlemen--Mr. Gray, you are not"
10738,ACT THE THIRD.,merry.--
10739,ACT THE THIRD.,
10740,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Gray_. More wine, say I, and mirth shall ensue in course. What! we"
10741,ACT THE THIRD.,have not yet above three half-pints a man to answer for. Brevity is
10742,ACT THE THIRD.,"the soul of drinking, as of wit. Despatch, I say. More wine."
10743,ACT THE THIRD.,(_Fills_.)
10744,ACT THE THIRD.,
10745,ACT THE THIRD.,"_1st Gent_. I entreat you, let there be some order, some method, in"
10746,ACT THE THIRD.,"our drinkings. I love to lose my reason with my eyes open, to commit"
10747,ACT THE THIRD.,the deed of drunkenness with forethought and deliberation. I love to
10748,ACT THE THIRD.,"feel the fumes of the liquor gathering here, like clouds."
10749,ACT THE THIRD.,
10750,ACT THE THIRD.,"_2nd Gent_. And I am for plunging into madness at once. Damn order,"
10751,ACT THE THIRD.,"and method, and steps, and degrees, that he speaks of. Let confusion"
10752,ACT THE THIRD.,have her legitimate work.
10753,ACT THE THIRD.,
10754,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. I marvel why the poets, who, of all men, methinks, should"
10755,ACT THE THIRD.,"possess the hottest livers, and most empyreal fancies, should affect"
10756,ACT THE THIRD.,to see such virtues in cold water.
10757,ACT THE THIRD.,
10758,ACT THE THIRD.,_Gray_. Virtue in cold water! ha! ha! ha!
10759,ACT THE THIRD.,
10760,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Because your poet-born hath an internal wine, richer than"
10761,ACT THE THIRD.,"lippara or canaries, yet uncrushed from any grapes of earth,"
10762,ACT THE THIRD.,unpressed in mortal wine-presses.
10763,ACT THE THIRD.,
10764,ACT THE THIRD.,3_rd Gent_. What may be the name of this wine?
10765,ACT THE THIRD.,
10766,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. It hath as many names as qualities. It is denominated
10767,ACT THE THIRD.,"indifferently, wit, conceit, invention, inspiration, but its most"
10768,ACT THE THIRD.,royal and comprehensive name is _fancy_.
10769,ACT THE THIRD.,
10770,ACT THE THIRD.,3_rd Gent_. And where keeps he this sovereign liquor?
10771,ACT THE THIRD.,
10772,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Its cellars are in the brain, whence your true poet deriveth"
10773,ACT THE THIRD.,"intoxication at will; while his animal spirits, catching a pride from"
10774,ACT THE THIRD.,"the quality and neighborhood of their noble relative, the brain,"
10775,ACT THE THIRD.,refuse to be sustained by wines and fermentations of earth.
10776,ACT THE THIRD.,
10777,ACT THE THIRD.,3_rd Gent_. But is your poet-born always tipsy with this liquor?
10778,ACT THE THIRD.,
10779,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. He hath his stoopings and reposes; but his proper element is
10780,ACT THE THIRD.,"the sky, and in the suburbs of the empyrean."
10781,ACT THE THIRD.,
10782,ACT THE THIRD.,"3_rd Gent_. Is your wine-intellectual so exquisite? henceforth, I, a"
10783,ACT THE THIRD.,"man of plain conceit, will, in all humility, content my mind with"
10784,ACT THE THIRD.,canaries.
10785,ACT THE THIRD.,
10786,ACT THE THIRD.,4_th Gent_. I am for a song or a catch. When will the catches come

10800,ACT THE THIRD.,his Majesty's birthday?
10801,ACT THE THIRD.,
10802,ACT THE THIRD.,_Gray_. What follows?
10803,ACT THE THIRD.,
10804,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. That every man should sing, and be joyful, and ask no"

10809,ACT THE THIRD.,"3_rd Gent_. For certain, 'tis a blessed monarchy."
10810,ACT THE THIRD.,
10811,ACT THE THIRD.,2_nd Gent_. The cursed fanatic days we have seen! The times have been
10812,ACT THE THIRD.,when swearing was out of fashion.
10813,ACT THE THIRD.,
10814,ACT THE THIRD.,3_rd Gent_. And drinking.
10815,ACT THE THIRD.,
10816,ACT THE THIRD.,1_st Gent_. And wenching.
10817,ACT THE THIRD.,
10818,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Gray_. The cursed yeas and forsooths, which we have heard uttered,"
10819,ACT THE THIRD.,"when a man could not rap out an innocent oath, but straight the air"
10820,ACT THE THIRD.,was thought to be infected.
10821,ACT THE THIRD.,
10822,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. 'Twas a pleasant trick of the saint, which that trim puritan"

10824,ACT THE THIRD.,"an oath for committing with his servant-maid, to cause his house to"
10825,ACT THE THIRD.,"be fumigated with burnt brandy, and ends of scripture, to disperse"
10826,ACT THE THIRD.,"the devil's breath, as he termed it."
10827,ACT THE THIRD.,
10828,ACT THE THIRD.,_All_. Ha! ha! ha!
10829,ACT THE THIRD.,
10830,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Gray_. But 'twas pleasanter, when the other saint"
10831,ACT THE THIRD.,_Resist-the-devil-and-he-will-flee-from-thee Pureman_ was overtaken
10832,ACT THE THIRD.,"in the act, to plead an illusio visûs, and maintain his sanctity upon"
10833,ACT THE THIRD.,a supposed power in the adversary to counterfeit the shapes of
10834,ACT THE THIRD.,things.
10835,ACT THE THIRD.,
10836,ACT THE THIRD.,_All_. Ha! ha! ha!
10837,ACT THE THIRD.,
10838,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Another round, and then let every man devise what trick he"
10839,ACT THE THIRD.,"can in his fancy, for the better manifesting our loyalty this day."
10840,ACT THE THIRD.,
10841,ACT THE THIRD.,_Gray_. Shall we hang a puritan?
10842,ACT THE THIRD.,
10843,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. No, that has been done already in Coleman Street."
10844,ACT THE THIRD.,
10845,ACT THE THIRD.,2_nd Gent_. Or fire a conventicle?
10846,ACT THE THIRD.,
10847,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. That is stale too.
10848,ACT THE THIRD.,
10849,ACT THE THIRD.,3_rd Gent_. Or burn the Assembly's catechism?
10850,ACT THE THIRD.,
10851,ACT THE THIRD.,"4_th Gent_. Or drink the king's health, every man standing upon his"
10852,ACT THE THIRD.,head naked?

10854,ACT THE THIRD.,_John (to Lovel)_. We have here some pleasant madness.
10855,ACT THE THIRD.,
10856,ACT THE THIRD.,"3_rd Gent_. Who shall pledge me in a pint bumper, while we drink to"
10857,ACT THE THIRD.,the king upon our knees?
10858,ACT THE THIRD.,
10859,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. Why on our knees, Cavalier?"
10860,ACT THE THIRD.,
10861,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_ (_smiling_). For more devotion, to be sure. (_To a servant_.)"

10866,ACT THE THIRD.,of the goblets._
10867,ACT THE THIRD.,
10868,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. We have here the unchecked virtues of the grape. How the
10869,ACT THE THIRD.,vapors curl upwards! It were a life of gods to dwell in such an
10870,ACT THE THIRD.,"element: to see, and hear, and talk brave things. Now fie upon these"
10871,ACT THE THIRD.,casual potations. That a man's most exalted reason should depend upon
10872,ACT THE THIRD.,"the ignoble fermenting of a fruit, which sparrows pluck at as well as"
10873,ACT THE THIRD.,we.
10874,ACT THE THIRD.,
10875,ACT THE THIRD.,_Gray_ (_aside to Lovel_). Observe how he is ravished.
10876,ACT THE THIRD.,
10877,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. Vanity and gay thoughts of wine do meet in him and engender
10878,ACT THE THIRD.,madness.
10879,ACT THE THIRD.,
10880,ACT THE THIRD.,"[_While the rest are engaged in a wild kind of talk_, JOHN _advances"
10881,ACT THE THIRD.,"to the front of the stage, and soliloquizes_."
10882,ACT THE THIRD.,
10883,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. My spirits turn to fire, they mount so fast."
10884,ACT THE THIRD.,"My joys are turbulent, my hopes show like fruition."
10885,ACT THE THIRD.,"These high and gusty relishes of life, sure,"
10886,ACT THE THIRD.,Have no allayings of mortality in them.
10887,ACT THE THIRD.,"I am too hot now, and o'ercapable,"
10888,ACT THE THIRD.,"For the tedious processes, and creeping wisdom,"
10889,ACT THE THIRD.,"Of human acts, and enterprises of a man."
10890,ACT THE THIRD.,"I want some seasonings of adversity,"

10896,ACT THE THIRD.,2_nd Gent_. Where is Woodvil?
10897,ACT THE THIRD.,
10898,ACT THE THIRD.,_Gray_. Let him alone. I have seen him in these lunes before. His
10899,ACT THE THIRD.,abstractions must not taint the good mirth.
10900,ACT THE THIRD.,
10901,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_ (_continuing to soliloquize_). O for some friend, now,"

10908,ACT THE THIRD.,Would presently rush back
10909,ACT THE THIRD.,"Into the pristine state of singularity,"
10910,ACT THE THIRD.,And each man stand alone.
10911,ACT THE THIRD.,
10912,ACT THE THIRD.,(_A servant enters_.)

10935,ACT THE THIRD.,"This Lovel here's of a tough honesty,"
10936,ACT THE THIRD.,Would put the rack to the proof. He is not of that sort

10939,ACT THE THIRD.,"Spend vows as fast as vapors, which go off"

10942,ACT THE THIRD.,Shame not his o'ernight's promises;
10943,ACT THE THIRD.,"Talks little, flatters less, and makes no promises;"
10944,ACT THE THIRD.,"Why this is he, whom the dark-wisdom'd fate"

10947,ACT THE THIRD.,Why should I fear this man?                     [_Seeing_ LOVEL.
10948,ACT THE THIRD.,Where is the company gone?
10949,ACT THE THIRD.,
10950,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. To see the fireworks, where you will be expected to follow."
10951,ACT THE THIRD.,But I perceive you are better engaged.
10952,ACT THE THIRD.,
10953,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. I have been meditating this half hour,"
10954,ACT THE THIRD.,"On all the properties of a brave friendship,"
10955,ACT THE THIRD.,"The mysteries that are in it, the noble uses,"
10956,ACT THE THIRD.,"Its limits withal, and its nice boundaries."
10957,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Exempli gratiâ_, how far a man"
10958,ACT THE THIRD.,May lawfully forswear himself for his friend;
10959,ACT THE THIRD.,"What quantity of lies, some of them brave ones,"
10960,ACT THE THIRD.,He may lawfully incur in a friend's behalf!
10961,ACT THE THIRD.,"What oaths, blood-crimes, hereditary quarrels,"
10962,ACT THE THIRD.,"Night brawls, fierce words, and duels in the morning,"
10963,ACT THE THIRD.,"He need not stick at, to maintain his friend's honor, or his cause."
10964,ACT THE THIRD.,
10965,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. I think many men would die for their friends.
10966,ACT THE THIRD.,
10967,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Death! why,'tis nothing. We go to it for sport,"
10968,ACT THE THIRD.,"To gain a name or purse, or please a sullen humor,"
10969,ACT THE THIRD.,"When one has worn his fortune's livery threadbare,"
10970,ACT THE THIRD.,"Or his spleen'd mistress frowns. Husbands will venture on it,"

10976,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. To serve a friend this he may do. Pray, mark me."
10977,ACT THE THIRD.,Having a law within (great spirits feel one)
10978,ACT THE THIRD.,"He cannot, ought not, to be bound by any"
10979,ACT THE THIRD.,"Positive laws or ord'nances extern,"
10980,ACT THE THIRD.,But may reject all these: by the law of friendship
10981,ACT THE THIRD.,"He may do so much, be they, indifferently,"
10982,ACT THE THIRD.,"Penn'd statutes, or the land's unwritten usages,"
10983,ACT THE THIRD.,"As public fame, civil compliances,"
10984,ACT THE THIRD.,"Misnamed honor, trust in matter of secrets,"
10985,ACT THE THIRD.,"All vows and promises, the feeble mind's religion,"
10986,ACT THE THIRD.,(Binding our morning knowledge to approve
10987,ACT THE THIRD.,What last night's ignorance spake;)
10988,ACT THE THIRD.,"The ties of blood withal, and prejudice of kin."

10993,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. I hope you think me worthy.
10994,ACT THE THIRD.,
10995,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. You will smile to hear now--
10996,ACT THE THIRD.,Sir Walter never has been out of the island.
10997,ACT THE THIRD.,
10998,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. You amaze me.
10999,ACT THE THIRD.,
11000,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. That same report of his escape to France
11001,ACT THE THIRD.,"Was a fine tale, forged by myself--"
11002,ACT THE THIRD.,Ha! ha!
11003,ACT THE THIRD.,I knew it would stagger him.
11004,ACT THE THIRD.,
11005,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_.                 Pray, give me leave."
11006,ACT THE THIRD.,"Where has he dwelt, how lived, how lain conceal'd?"
11007,ACT THE THIRD.,Sure I may ask so much.
11008,ACT THE THIRD.,
11009,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. From place to place, dwelling in no place long,"
11010,ACT THE THIRD.,"My brother Simon still hath borne him company,"
11011,ACT THE THIRD.,"('Tis a brave youth, I envy him all his virtues)."
11012,ACT THE THIRD.,"Disguised in foreign garb, they pass for Frenchmen,"
11013,ACT THE THIRD.,Two Protestant exiles from the Limousin
11014,ACT THE THIRD.,"Newly arrived. Their dwelling's now at Nottingham,"
11015,ACT THE THIRD.,Where no soul knows them.
11016,ACT THE THIRD.,
11017,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. Can you assign any reason why a gentleman of Sir Walter's
11018,ACT THE THIRD.,known prudence should expose his person so lightly?
11019,ACT THE THIRD.,
11020,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. I believe, a certain fondness,"
11021,ACT THE THIRD.,"A childlike cleaving to the land that gave him birth,"
11022,ACT THE THIRD.,Chains him like fate.
11023,ACT THE THIRD.,
11024,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_.          I have known some exiles thus
11025,ACT THE THIRD.,"To linger out the term of the law's indulgence,"
11026,ACT THE THIRD.,To the hazard of being known.
11027,ACT THE THIRD.,
11028,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. You may suppose sometimes
11029,ACT THE THIRD.,"They use the neighb'ring Sherwood for their sport,"
11030,ACT THE THIRD.,Their exercise and freer recreation.--
11031,ACT THE THIRD.,"I see you smile. Pray now, be careful."
11032,ACT THE THIRD.,
11033,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. I am no babbler, sir; you need not fear me."
11034,ACT THE THIRD.,
11035,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. But some men have been known to talk in their sleep,"
11036,ACT THE THIRD.,And tell fine tales that way.
11037,ACT THE THIRD.,
11038,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. I have heard so much. But, to say truth, I mostly sleep"
11039,ACT THE THIRD.,alone.
11040,ACT THE THIRD.,
11041,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Or drink, sir? do you never drink too freely?"
11042,ACT THE THIRD.,"Some men will drink, and tell you all their secrets."
11043,ACT THE THIRD.,
11044,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. Why do you question me, who know my habits?"
11045,ACT THE THIRD.,
11046,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. I think you are no sot
11047,ACT THE THIRD.,"No tavern-troubler, worshipper of the grape;"
11048,ACT THE THIRD.,"But all men drink sometimes,"
11049,ACT THE THIRD.,"And veriest saints at festivals relax,"
11050,ACT THE THIRD.,"The marriage of a friend, or a wife's birthday."
11051,ACT THE THIRD.,
11052,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. How much, sir, may a man with safety drink?"
11053,ACT THE THIRD.,[_Smiling_.
11054,ACT THE THIRD.,
11055,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Sir, three half-pints a day is reasonable;"
11056,ACT THE THIRD.,I care not if you never exceed that quantity.
11057,ACT THE THIRD.,
11058,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. I shall observe it;
11059,ACT THE THIRD.,On holidays two quarts.
11060,ACT THE THIRD.,
11061,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Or, stay; you keep no wench?"
11062,ACT THE THIRD.,
11063,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. Ha!
11064,ACT THE THIRD.,
11065,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. No painted mistress for your private hours?
11066,ACT THE THIRD.,"You keep no whore, sir?"
11067,ACT THE THIRD.,
11068,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_.             What does he mean?
11069,ACT THE THIRD.,
11070,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Who for a close embrace, a toy of sin,"
11071,ACT THE THIRD.,"And amorous praising of your worship's breath,"
11072,ACT THE THIRD.,"In rosy junction of four melting lips,"
11073,ACT THE THIRD.,Can kiss out secrets from you?
11074,ACT THE THIRD.,
11075,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. How strange this passionate behavior shows in you
11076,ACT THE THIRD.,"Sure, you think me some weak one."
11077,ACT THE THIRD.,
11078,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_. Pray pardon me some fears.
11079,ACT THE THIRD.,You have now the pledge of a dear father's life.
11080,ACT THE THIRD.,I am a son--would fain be thought a loving one;
11081,ACT THE THIRD.,"You may allow me some fears: do not despise me,"
11082,ACT THE THIRD.,"If, in a posture foreign to my spirit,"
11083,ACT THE THIRD.,"And by our well-knit friendship, I conjure you,"
11084,ACT THE THIRD.,Touch not Sir Walter's life.                          [_Kneels._
11085,ACT THE THIRD.,You see these tears. My father's an old man.
11086,ACT THE THIRD.,Pray let him live.
11087,ACT THE THIRD.,
11088,ACT THE THIRD.,"_Lovel_. I must be bold to tell you, these new freedoms"
11089,ACT THE THIRD.,Show most unhandsome in you.
11090,ACT THE THIRD.,
11091,ACT THE THIRD.,_John_ (_rising_).     Ha! do you say so?
11092,ACT THE THIRD.,"Sure, you are not grown proud upon my secret!"
11093,ACT THE THIRD.,Ah! now I see it plain. He would be babbling.
11094,ACT THE THIRD.,No doubt a garrulous and hard-faced traitor--
11095,ACT THE THIRD.,But I'll not give you leave.                           [_Draws._
11096,ACT THE THIRD.,
11097,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. What does this madman mean?
11098,ACT THE THIRD.,
11099,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_. Come, sir; here is no subterfuge;"
11100,ACT THE THIRD.,"You must kill me, or I kill you."
11101,ACT THE THIRD.,
11102,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_ (_drawing_). Then self-defence plead my excuse.
11103,ACT THE THIRD.,"Have at you, sir.                                 [_They fight._"
11104,ACT THE THIRD.,
11105,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_.          Stay, sir."
11106,ACT THE THIRD.,I hope you have made your will.
11107,ACT THE THIRD.,"If not,'tis no great matter."
11108,ACT THE THIRD.,A broken cavalier has seldom much
11109,ACT THE THIRD.,"He can bequeath; an old worn peruke,"
11110,ACT THE THIRD.,"A snuffbox with a picture of Prince Rupert,"
11111,ACT THE THIRD.,"A rusty sword he'll swear was used at Naseby,"
11112,ACT THE THIRD.,Though it ne'er came within ten miles of the place;
11113,ACT THE THIRD.,"And if he's very rich,"
11114,ACT THE THIRD.,"A cheap edition of the _Icon Basilike_,"
11115,ACT THE THIRD.,Is mostly all the wealth he dies possest of.
11116,ACT THE THIRD.,"You say few prayers, I fancy;--"
11117,ACT THE THIRD.,
11118,ACT THE THIRD.,So to it again.   [_They fight again._ LOVEL _is disarmed._
11119,ACT THE THIRD.,
11120,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_. You had best now take my life. I guess you mean it.
11121,ACT THE THIRD.,
11122,ACT THE THIRD.,"_John_ (_musing_). No:--Men will say I fear'd him,"
11123,ACT THE THIRD.,if I kill'd him.
11124,ACT THE THIRD.,"Live still, and be a traitor in thy wish,"
11125,ACT THE THIRD.,"But never act thy thought, being a coward."
11126,ACT THE THIRD.,"That vengeance, which thy soul shall nightly thirst for,"
11127,ACT THE THIRD.,"And this disgrace I've done you cry aloud for,"
11128,ACT THE THIRD.,Still have the will without the power to execute.
11129,ACT THE THIRD.,"So now I leave you,"
11130,ACT THE THIRD.,Feeling a sweet security. No doubt
11131,ACT THE THIRD.,My secret shall remain a virgin for you!
11132,ACT THE THIRD.,"[_Goes out, smiling in scorn_."
11133,ACT THE THIRD.,
11134,ACT THE THIRD.,_Lovel_ (_rising_). For once you are mistaken in your man.
11135,ACT THE THIRD.,"The deed you wot of shall forthwith be done,"
11136,ACT THE THIRD.,"A bird let loose, a secret out of hand,"
11137,ACT THE THIRD.,"Returns not back. Why, then 'tis baby policy"
11138,ACT THE THIRD.,To menace him who hath it in his keeping.
11139,ACT THE THIRD.,I will go look for Gray;
11140,ACT THE THIRD.,"Then, northward ho! such tricks as we shall play"
11141,ACT THE THIRD.,"Have not been seen, I think, in merry Sherwood,"
11142,ACT THE THIRD.,"Since the days of Robin Hood, that archer good."

11156,ACT THE FOURTH.,"Now all those jovial fancies, and bright hopes,"
11157,ACT THE FOURTH.,"Children of wine, go off like dreams."
11158,ACT THE FOURTH.,This sick vertigo here
11159,ACT THE FOURTH.,"Preacheth of temperance, no sermon better."
11160,ACT THE FOURTH.,"These black thoughts, and dull melancholy,"
11161,ACT THE FOURTH.,"That stick like burrs to the brain, will they ne'er leave me?"
11162,ACT THE FOURTH.,"Some men are full of choler, when they are drunk;"
11163,ACT THE FOURTH.,Some brawl of matter foreign to themselves;
11164,ACT THE FOURTH.,"And some, the most resolved fools of all,"

11170,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.
11171,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11172,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Lovel_. Sir, we are sorry we cannot return your French salutation."
11173,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11174,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Gray_. Nor otherwise consider this garb you trust to than as a poor
11175,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,disguise.
11176,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11177,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Lovel_. Nor use much ceremony with a traitor.
11178,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11179,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Gray_. Therefore, without much induction of superfluous words, I"
11180,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"attach you, Sir Walter Woodvil, of High Treason, in the King's name."
11181,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11182,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Lovel_. And of taking part in the great Rebellion against our late
11183,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"lawful Sovereign, Charles the First."
11184,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11185,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Simon_. John has betrayed us, father."
11186,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11187,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Lovel_. Come, sir, you had best surrender fairly. We know you, sir."
11188,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11189,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Simon_. Hang ye, villains, ye are two better known than trusted. I"
11190,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"have seen those faces before. Are ye not two beggarly retainers,"
11191,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"trencher-parasites, to John? I think ye rank above his footmen. A"
11192,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,sort of bed and board worms--locusts that infest our house; a leprosy
11193,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"that long has hung upon its walls and princely apartments, reaching"
11194,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,to fill all the corners of my brother's once noble heart.
11195,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11196,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Gray_. We are his friends.
11197,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11198,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Simon_. Fie, sir, do not weep. How these rogues will triumph! Shall"
11199,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"I whip off their heads, father?"
11200,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11201,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,[_Draws_.
11202,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11203,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Lovel_. Come, sir, though this show handsome in you, being his son,"
11204,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,yet the law must have its course.
11205,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11206,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Simon_. And if I tell ye the law shall not have its course, cannot"
11207,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"ye be content? Courage, father; shall such things as these apprehend"
11208,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"a man? Which of ye will venture upon me?--Will you, Mr. Constable"
11209,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"self-elect? or you, sir, with a pimple on your nose, got at Oxford by"
11210,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"hard drinking, your only badge of loyalty?"
11211,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11212,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Gray_. 'Tis a brave youth--I cannot strike at him.
11213,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11214,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Simon_. Father, why do you cover your face with your hands? Why do"
11215,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"you fetch your breath so hard? See, villains, his heart is burst! O"
11216,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"villains, he cannot speak. One of you run for some water; quickly, ye"
11217,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,knaves; will ye have your throats cut?
11218,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11219,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,[_They both slink off_.
11220,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11221,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"How is it with you, Sir Walter? Look up, sir, the villains are gone."
11222,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"He hears me not, and this deep disgrace of treachery in his son hath"
11223,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"touched him even to the death. O most distuned and distempered world,"
11224,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,where sons talk their aged fathers into their graves! Garrulous and
11225,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"diseased world, and still empty, rotten and hollow _talking_ world,"
11226,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"where good men decay, states turn round in an endless mutability, and"
11227,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"still for the worse; nothing is at a stay, nothing abides but vanity,"
11228,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"chaotic vanity.--Brother, adieu!"
11229,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11230,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"There lies the parent stock which gave us life,"
11231,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Which I will see consign'd with tears to earth.
11232,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Leave thou the solemn funeral rites to me,"
11233,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Grief and a true remorse abide with thee.

11239,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11240,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Marg_. (_alone_.) It was an error merely, and no crime,"
11241,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"An unsuspecting openness in youth,"
11242,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"That from his lips the fatal secret drew,"
11243,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Which should have slept like one of nature's mysteries,"
11244,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Unveil'd by any man.
11245,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Well, he is dead!"
11246,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,And what should Margaret do in the forest?
11247,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,O ill-starr'd John!
11248,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"O Woodvil, man enfeoff'd to despair!"
11249,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Take thy farewell of peace.
11250,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"O never look again to see good days,"
11251,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Or close thy lids in comfortable nights,"
11252,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Or ever think a happy thought again,"
11253,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,If what I have heard be true.--
11254,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Forsaken of the world must Woodvil live,"
11255,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,If he did tell these men.
11256,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"No tongue must speak to him, no tongue of man"
11257,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Salute him, when he wakes up in a morning;"

11259,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"In amity with thee, must for thy sake"
11260,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Abide the world's reproach. What then?
11261,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Shall Margaret join the clamors of the world
11262,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Against her friend? O undiscerning world,"
11263,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"That cannot from misfortune separate guilt,"
11264,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"No, not in thought! O never, never, John."
11265,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Prepared to share the fortunes of her friend
11266,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_For better or for worse_, thy Margaret comes,"
11267,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"To pour into thy wounds a healing love,"
11268,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,And wake the memory of an ancient friendship.
11269,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"And pardon me, thou spirit of Sir Walter,"
11270,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"Who, in compassion to the wretched living,"

11276,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,SANDFORD. MARGARET. (_As from a Journey_.)
11277,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11278,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Sand_. The violence of the sudden mischance hath so wrought in him,"
11279,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,who by nature is allied to nothing _less_ than a self-debasing humor
11280,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"of dejection, that I have never seen anything more changed and"
11281,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"spirit-broken. He hath, with a peremptory resolution, dismissed the"
11282,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"partners of his riots and late hours, denied his house and person to"
11283,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"their most earnest solicitings, and will be seen by none. He keeps"
11284,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"ever alone, and his grief (which is solitary) does not so much seem"
11285,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"to possess and govern in him, as it is by Him, with a wilfulness of"
11286,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"most manifest affection, entertained and cherished."
11287,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11288,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Marg_. How bears he up against the common rumor?
11289,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11290,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Sand_. With a strange indifference, which, whosoever dives not into"
11291,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,the niceness of his sorrow might mistake for obdurate and insensate.
11292,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,Yet are the wings of his pride forever clipt; and yet a virtuous
11293,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"predominance of filial grief is so ever uppermost, that you may"
11294,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,discover his thoughts less troubled with conjecturing what living
11295,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"opinions will say, and judge of his deeds, than absorbed and buried"
11296,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"with the dead, whom his indiscretion made so."
11297,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11298,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Marg_. I knew a greatness ever to be resident in him, to which the"
11299,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,admiring eyes of men should look up even in the declining and
11300,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"bankrupt state of his pride. Fain would I see him, fain talk with"
11301,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"him; but that a sense of respect, which is violated, when without"
11302,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"deliberation we press into the society of the unhappy, checks and"
11303,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"holds me back. How, think you, he would bear my presence?"
11304,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11305,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"_Sand_. As of an assured friend, whom in the forgetfulness of his"
11306,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,fortunes he past by. See him you must; but not to-night. The newness
11307,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,of the sight shall move the bitterest compunction and the truest
11308,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"remorse; but afterwards, trust me, dear lady, the happiest effects of"
11309,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"a returning peace, and a gracious comfort, to him, to you, and all of"
11310,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,us.
11311,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11312,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Marg_. I think he would not deny me. He hath ere this received
11313,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"farewell letters from his brother, who hath taken a resolution to"
11314,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"estrange himself, for a time, from country, friends, and kindred, and"
11315,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,to seek occupation for his sad thoughts in travelling in foreign
11316,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,"places, where sights remote and extern to himself may draw from him"
11317,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,kindly and not painful ruminations.
11318,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,
11319,SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.,_Sand_. I was present at the receipt of the letter. The contents

11536,ACT THE FIFTH.,_Marg_. To give you in your stead a better self!
11537,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Such as you were, when these eyes first beheld"
11538,ACT THE FIFTH.,"You mounted on your sprightly steed, White Margery,"

11550,ACT THE FIFTH.,_John_. Now Margaret weeps herself.
11551,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11552,ACT THE FIFTH.,(_A noise of bells heard_.)
11553,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11554,ACT THE FIFTH.,"_Marg_. Hark the bells, John."
11555,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11556,ACT THE FIFTH.,_John_. Those are the church-bells of St. Mary Ottery.

11558,ACT THE FIFTH.,_Marg_. I know it.
11559,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11560,ACT THE FIFTH.,"_John_. St. Mary Ottery, my native village"

11562,ACT THE FIFTH.,Those are the bells.
11563,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11564,ACT THE FIFTH.,"_Marg._           Wilt go to church, John?"
11565,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11566,ACT THE FIFTH.,_John._ I have been there already.
11567,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11568,ACT THE FIFTH.,_Marg._ How canst say thou hast been there already?
11569,ACT THE FIFTH.,"The bells are only now ringing for morning service,"

11571,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11572,ACT THE FIFTH.,"_John._ I left my bed betimes, I could not sleep,"
11573,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And when I rose, I look'd (as my custom is)"
11574,ACT THE FIFTH.,"From my chamber window, where I can see the sun rise;"
11575,ACT THE FIFTH.,And the first object I discern'd
11576,ACT THE FIFTH.,Was the glistering spire of St. Mary Ottery.
11577,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11578,ACT THE FIFTH.,"_Marg._ Well, John."
11579,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11580,ACT THE FIFTH.,_John._ Then I remember'd 'twas the sabbath day.
11581,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Immediately a wish arose in my mind,"
11582,ACT THE FIFTH.,To go to church and pray with Christian people.
11583,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And then I check'd myself, and said to myself,"
11584,ACT THE FIFTH.,"""Thou hast been a heathen, John, these two years past,"
11585,ACT THE FIFTH.,"(Not having been at church in all that time,)"
11586,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And is it fit, that now for the first time"
11587,ACT THE FIFTH.,Thou shouldst offend the eyes of Christian people
11588,ACT THE FIFTH.,With a murderer's presence in the house of prayer?
11589,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Thou wouldst but discompose their pious thoughts,"
11590,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And do thyself no good: for how couldst thou pray,"
11591,ACT THE FIFTH.,"With unwash'd hands, and lips unused to the offices?"""
11592,ACT THE FIFTH.,And then I at my own presumption smiled;
11593,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And then I wept that I should smile at all,"
11594,ACT THE FIFTH.,Having such cause of grief! I wept outright:
11595,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Tears like a river flooded all my face,"
11596,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And I began to pray, and found I could pray;"
11597,ACT THE FIFTH.,And still I yearn'd to say my prayers in the church.
11598,ACT THE FIFTH.,"""Doubtless (said I) one might find comfort in it."""
11599,ACT THE FIFTH.,"So stealing down the stairs, like one that fear'd detection,"
11600,ACT THE FIFTH.,Or was about to act unlawful business
11601,ACT THE FIFTH.,"At that dead time of dawn,"
11602,ACT THE FIFTH.,"I flew to the church, and found the doors wide open."
11603,ACT THE FIFTH.,"(Whether by negligence I knew not,"

11606,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11607,ACT THE FIFTH.,_Marg_. Yes.
11608,ACT THE FIFTH.,
11609,ACT THE FIFTH.,"_John_. So entering in, not without fear,"
11610,ACT THE FIFTH.,"I passed into the family pew,"
11611,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And covering up my eyes for shame,"
11612,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And deep perception of unworthiness,"
11613,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Upon the little hassock knelt me down,"
11614,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Where I so oft had kneel'd,"
11615,ACT THE FIFTH.,A docile infant by Sir Walter's side;
11616,ACT THE FIFTH.,"And, thinking so, I wept a second flood"
11617,ACT THE FIFTH.,More poignant than the first;
11618,ACT THE FIFTH.,But afterwards was greatly comforted.
11619,ACT THE FIFTH.,It seem'd the guilt of blood was passing from me
11620,ACT THE FIFTH.,"Even in the act and agony of tears,"

13374,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13375,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby._ It was ill done though of this Mistress Frampton,"
13376,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,This forward Widow.  But a ride's poor loss
13377,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Imports not much. In to your chamber, love,"
13378,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Where you with music may beguile the hour,"
13379,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"While I am tossing over dusty tomes,"
13380,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Till our most reasonable friend returns.
13381,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13382,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Kath_. I am all obedience.               [_Exit_ KATHERINE.
13383,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13384,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_.                    Too obedient, Kate,"
13385,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And to too many masters. I can hardly
13386,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,On such a day as this refrain to speak
13387,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"My sense of this injurious friend, this pest,"
13388,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"This household evil, this close-clinging fiend,"
13389,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"In rough terms to my wife. 'Death, my own servants"
13390,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Controll'd above me! orders countermanded!
13391,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,What next?              [_Servant enters and announces the Sister._
13392,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13393,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Enter_ LUCY.
13394,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13395,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Sister! I know you are come to welcome
13396,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,This day's return. 'Twas well done.
13397,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13398,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_.                       You seem ruffled.
13399,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,In years gone by this day was used to be
13400,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,The smoothest of the year. Your honey turn'd
13401,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,So soon to gall?
13402,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13403,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_.        Gall'd am I, and with cause,"
13404,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And rid to death, yet cannot get a riddance,"
13405,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Nay, scarce a ride, by this proud Widow's leave."
13406,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13407,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_. Something you wrote me of a Mistress Frampton.
13408,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13409,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_. She came at first a meek admitted guest,"
13410,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Pretending a short stay; her whole deportment
13411,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Seem'd as of one obliged. A slender trunk,"
13412,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"The wardrobe of her scant and ancient clothing,"
13413,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Bespoke no more. But in few days her dress,"
13414,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Her looks, were proudly changed. And now she flaunts it"
13415,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,In jewels stolen or borrow'd from my wife;
13416,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Who owes her some strange service, of what nature"
13417,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I must be kept in ignorance. Katherine's meek
13418,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And gentle spirit cowers beneath her eye,"
13419,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,As spell-bound by some witch.
13420,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13421,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_.              Some mystery hangs on it.
13422,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,How bears she in her carriage towards yourself?
13423,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13424,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_. As one who fears, and yet not greatly cares"
13425,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"For my displeasure. Sometimes I have thought,"
13426,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"A secret glance would tell me she could love,"
13427,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,If I but gave encouragement. Before me
13428,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,She keeps some moderation; but is never
13429,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Closeted with my wife, but in the end"
13430,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I find my Katherine in briny tears.
13431,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"From the small chamber, where she first was lodged,"
13432,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,The gradual fiend by spacious wriggling arts
13433,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Has now ensconced herself in the best part
13434,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Of this large mansion; calls the left wing her own;
13435,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Commands my servants, equipage.--I hear"
13436,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Her hated tread. What makes she back so soon?
13437,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13438,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Enter_ MRS. FRAMPTON.
13439,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13440,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._ O, I am jolter'd, bruised, and shook to death,"
13441,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,With your vile Wiltshire roads. The villain Philip
13442,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Chose, on my conscience, the perversest tracks,"
13443,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And stoniest hard lanes in all the county,"
13444,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Till I was fain get out, and so walk back,"
13445,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,My errand unperform'd at Andover.
13446,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13447,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_. And I shall love the knave forever after.
13448,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,[_Aside_.
13449,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13450,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Mrs. F._ A friend with you!
13451,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13452,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_.                    My eldest sister, Lucy,"
13453,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Come to congratulate this returning morn.--
13454,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Sister, my wife's friend, Mistress Frampton."
13455,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13456,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._                                Pray,"
13457,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Be seated; for your brother's sake, you are welcome."
13458,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I had thought this day to have spent in homely fashion
13459,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"With the good couple, to whose hospitality"
13460,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I stand so far indebted.  But your coming
13461,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Makes it a feast.
13462,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13463,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy._            She does the honors naturally--
13464,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,[_Aside._
13465,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13466,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby._ As if she were the mistress of the house.--
13467,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,[_Aside._
13468,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13469,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Mrs. F._ I love to be at home with loving friends.
13470,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To stand on ceremony with obligations,"
13471,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Is to restrain the obliger.  That old coach, though,"
13472,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Of yours jumbles one strangely.
13473,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13474,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby._                  I shall order
13475,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"An equipage soon, more easy to you, madam--"
13476,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13477,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Lucy._ To drive her and her pride to Lucifer,"
13478,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I hope he means.                                     [_Aside._
13479,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13480,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Mrs. F._ I must go trim myself; this humbled garb
13481,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Would shame a wedding-feast. I have your leave
13482,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,For a short absence?--and your Katherine--
13483,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13484,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby._ You'll find her in her closet--
13485,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13486,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._                          Fare you well, then."
13487,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,[_Exit._
13488,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13489,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby._ How like you her assurance?
13490,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13491,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Lucy._                              Even so well,"
13492,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"That if this Widow were my guest, not yours,"
13493,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"She should have coach enough, and scope to ride."
13494,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,My merry groom should in a trice convey her
13495,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To Sarum Plain, and set her down at Stonehenge,"
13496,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,To pick her path through those antiques at leisure;
13497,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,She should take sample of our Wiltshire flints.
13498,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"O, be not lightly jealous! nor surmise,"
13499,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,That to a wanton bold-faced thing like this
13500,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Your modest shrinking Katherine could impart
13501,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Secrets of any worth, especially"
13502,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Secrets that touch'd your peace. If there be aught,"
13503,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"My life upon't,'tis but some girlish story"
13504,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Of a First Love; which even the boldest wife
13505,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Might modestly deny to a husband's ear,"
13506,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Much more your timid and too sensitive Katherine.
13507,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13508,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby_. I think it is no more; and will dismiss
13509,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"My further fears, if ever I have had such."
13510,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13511,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Lucy_. Shall we go walk? I'd see your gardens, brother;"
13512,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And how the new trees thrive, I recommended."
13513,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Your Katherine is engaged now--
13514,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13515,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby_.                    I'll attend you.

13523,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13524,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Housekeeper_. Our Lady's guest, since her short ride, seems ruffled,"
13525,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And somewhat in disorder. Philip, Philip,"
13526,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I do suspect some roguery. Your mad tricks
13527,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Will some day cost you a good place, I warrant."
13528,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13529,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Philip_. Good Mistress Jane, our serious housekeeper,"
13530,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And sage Duenna to the maids and scullions,"
13531,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"We must have leave to laugh; our brains are younger,"
13532,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And undisturb'd with care of keys and pantries.
13533,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,We are wild things.
13534,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13535,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Butler_.      Good Philip, tell us all."
13536,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13537,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_All_. Ay, as you live, tell, tell--"
13538,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13539,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Philip_. Mad fellows, you shall have it."
13540,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,The Widow's bell rang lustily and loud--
13541,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13542,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Butler_. I think that no one can mistake her ringing.
13543,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13544,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Waiting-maid_. Our Lady's ring is soft sweet music to it,"
13545,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,More of entreaty hath it than command.
13546,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13547,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Philip_. I lose my story, if you interrupt me thus."
13548,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"The bell, I say, rang fiercely; and a voice"
13549,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"More shrill than bell, call'd out for ""Coachman Philip!"""
13550,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13551,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"I straight obey'd, as 'tis my name and office,"
13552,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"""Drive me,"" quoth she, ""to the next market-town,"
13553,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Where I have hope of letters."" I made haste:"
13554,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Put to the horses, saw her safely coach'd,"
13555,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And drove her--
13556,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13557,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Waiting-maid_. By the straight high-road to Andover,"
13558,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I guess--
13559,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13560,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Philip_. Pray, warrant things within your knowledge,"
13561,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Good Mistress Abigail; look to your dressings,"
13562,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And leave the skill in horses to the coachman.
13563,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13564,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Butler_. He'll have his humor; best not interrupt him.
13565,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13566,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Philip_. 'Tis market-day, thought I; and the poor beasts,"
13567,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Meeting such droves of cattle and of people,"
13568,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"May take a fright; so down the lane I trundled,"
13569,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Where Goodman Dobson's crazy mare was founder'd,"
13570,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And where the flints were biggest, and ruts widest,"
13571,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"By ups and downs, and such bone-cracking motions"
13572,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"We flounder'd on a furlong, till my madam,"
13573,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"In policy, to save the few joints left her,"
13574,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Betook her to her feet, and there we parted."
13575,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13576,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_All_. Ha! ha! ha!
13577,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13578,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Butler_. Hang her, 'tis pity such as she should ride."
13579,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13580,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Waiting-maid_. I think she is a witch; I have tired myself out
13581,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,With sticking pins in her pillow; still she scapes them--
13582,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13583,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Butler_. And I with helping her to mum for claret,"
13584,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,But never yet could cheat her dainty palate.
13585,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13586,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Housekeeper_. Well, well, she is the guest of our good Mistress,"
13587,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And so should be respected. Though, I think,"
13588,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Our master cares not for her company,"
13589,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,He would ill brook we should express so much
13590,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"By rude discourtesies, and short attendance,"
13591,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Being but servants. (_A Bell rings furiously._)
13592,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,'Tis her bell speaks now;
13593,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Good, good, bestir yourselves: who knows who's wanted?"
13594,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13595,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Butler_. But 'twas a merry trick of Philip coachman.

13605,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Have traced our lots through life.--Another needle,"
13606,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,This works untowardly.--An heiress born
13607,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To splendid prospects, at our common school"
13608,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"I was as one above you all, not of you;"
13609,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Had my distinct prerogatives; my freedoms,"

13612,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Kath_.                 I must hear,"
13613,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,What you are pleased to speak--how my heart sinks here! [_Aside_.

13615,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F_. My chamber to myself, my separate maid,"
13616,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"My coach, and so forth.--Not that needle, simple one,"
13617,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,With the great staring eye fit for a Cyclops!
13618,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Mine own are not so blinded with their griefs,"
13619,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,But I could make a shift to thread a smaller.
13620,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"A cable or a camel might go through this,"
13621,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And never strain for the passage.
13622,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,

13676,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Without your silence on my dreadful secret!
13677,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And I would wish the league we have renew'd
13678,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Might be perpetual--
13679,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13680,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._        Have a care, fine madam!          [_Aside._"
13681,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13682,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Kath._ That one house still might hold us. But my husband
13683,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Has shown himself of late--
13684,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13685,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._                How, Mistress Selby?"
13686,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13687,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Kath._ Not, not impatient. You misconstrue him."
13688,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"He honors, and he loves, nay, he must love"
13689,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"The friend of his wife's youth. But there are moods,"
13690,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,In which--
13691,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13692,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._ I understand you;--in which husbands,"
13693,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And wives that love, may wish to be alone,"
13694,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To nurse the tender fits of new-born dalliance,"
13695,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,After a five years' wedlock.
13696,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13697,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Kath._                      Was that well,"
13698,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Or charitably put? do these pale cheeks
13699,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Proclaim a wanton blood? This wasting form
13700,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Seem a fit theatre for Levity
13701,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To play his love-tricks on; and act such follies,"
13702,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,As even in Affection's first bland Moon
13703,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Have less of grace than pardon in best wedlocks?
13704,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"I was about to say, that there are times,"
13705,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,When the most frank and sociable man
13706,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"May surfeit on most loved society,"
13707,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Preferring loneness rather--
13708,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13709,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Mrs. F._                  To my company--
13710,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13711,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Kath._ Ay, yours, or mine, or any one's. Nay, take"
13712,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Not this unto yourself. Even in the newness
13713,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Of our first married loves 'twas sometimes so.
13714,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"For solitude, I have heard my Selby say,"
13715,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Is to the mind as rest to the corporal functions;
13716,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And he would call it oft, the _day's soft sleep._"
13717,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13718,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._ What is your drift? and whereto tends this speech,"
13719,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Rhetorically labor'd?
13720,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13721,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Kath._                 That you would
13722,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Abstain but from our house a month, a week;"
13723,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I make request but for a single day.
13724,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13725,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._ A month, a week, a day! A single hour"
13726,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Is every week, and month, and the long year,"
13727,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And all the years to come! My footing here,"
13728,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Slipt once, recovers never. From the state"
13729,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Of gilded roofs, attendance, luxuries,"
13730,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Parks, gardens, sauntering walks, or wholesome rides,"
13731,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To the bare cottage on the withering moor,"
13732,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Where I myself am servant to myself,"
13733,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Or only waited on by blackest thoughts--
13734,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"I sink, if this be so. No; here I sit."
13735,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13736,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Kath_. Then I am lost forever!

13741,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,SCENE--_An Apartment contiguous to the last._
13742,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13743,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"SELBY, _as if listening_."
13744,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13745,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby_. The sounds have died away. What am I changed to?
13746,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"What do I here, list'ning like to an abject,"
13747,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Or heartless wittol, that must hear no good,"
13748,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"If he hear aught? ""This shall to the ear of your husband."""
13749,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"It was the Widow's word. I guess'd some mystery,"
13750,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And the solution with a vengeance comes.
13751,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"What can my wife have left untold to me,"
13752,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,That must be told by proxy? I begin
13753,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,To call in doubt the course of her life past
13754,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Under my very eyes. She hath not been good,"
13755,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Not virtuous, not discreet; she hath not outrun"
13756,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,My wishes still with prompt and meek observance.
13757,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Perhaps she is not fair, sweet-voiced; her eyes"
13758,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Not like the dove's; all this as well may be,"
13759,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,As that she should entreasure up a secret
13760,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"In the peculiar closet of her breast,"
13761,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And grudge it to my ear. It is my right
13762,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To claim the halves in any truth she owns,"
13763,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,As much as in the babe I have by her;
13764,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Upon whose face henceforth I fear to look,"
13765,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Lest I should fancy in its innocent brow
13766,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Some strange shame written.
13767,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13768,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Enter_ LUCY.
13769,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13770,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Sister, an anxious word with you."
13771,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"From out the chamber, where my wife but now"
13772,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Held talk with her encroaching friend, I heard"
13773,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"(Not of set purpose heark'ning, but by chance)"
13774,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"A voice of chiding, answer'd by a tone"
13775,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Of replication, such as the meek dove"
13776,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Makes, when the kite has clutch'd her. The high Widow"
13777,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Was loud and stormy. I distinctly heard
13778,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"One threat pronounced--""Your husband shall know all."""
13779,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"I am no listener, sister; and I hold"
13780,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"A secret, got by such unmanly shift,"
13781,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"The pitiful'st of thefts; but what mine ear,"
13782,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"I not intending it, receives perforce,"
13783,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,I count my lawful prize. Some subtle meaning
13784,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Lurks in this fiend's behavior; which, by force,"
13785,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Or fraud I must make mine.
13786,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13787,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_.               The gentlest means
13788,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Are still the wisest. What, if you should press"
13789,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,Your wife to a disclosure?
13790,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13791,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby_.              I have tried
13792,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"All gentler means; thrown out low hints, which, though"
13793,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Merely suggestions still, have never fail'd"
13794,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To blanch her cheek with fears. Roughlier to insist,"
13795,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"Would be to kill, where I but meant to heal."
13796,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13797,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_. Your own description gave that Widow out
13798,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"As one not much precise, nor over-coy,"
13799,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And nice to listen to a suit of love.
13800,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"What if you feign'd a courtship, putting on,"
13801,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"(To work the secret from her easy faith,)"
13802,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"For honest ends, a most dishonest seeming?"
13803,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13804,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_. I see your drift, and partly meet your counsel."
13805,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"But must it not in me appear prodigious,"
13806,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To say the least, unnatural, and suspicious,"
13807,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"To move hot love, where I have shown cool scorn,"
13808,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,And undissembled looks of blank aversion?
13809,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13810,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Lucy_. Vain woman is the dupe of her own charms,"
13811,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"And easily credits the resistless power,"
13812,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"That in besieging beauty lies, to cast down"
13813,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,The slight-built fortress of a casual hate.
13814,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13815,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Selby_. I am resolved--
13816,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13817,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,_Lucy_.                  Success attend your wooing!
13818,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,
13819,MR. SELBY. KATHERINE.,"_Selby_. And I'll about it roundly, my wise sister."

13826,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13827,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Selby_. A fortunate encounter, Mistress Frampton."
13828,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"My purpose was, if you could spare so much"
13829,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"From your sweet leisure, a few words in private."
13830,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13831,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Mrs. F._ What mean his alter'd tones? These looks to me,"
13832,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Whose glances yet he has repell'd with coolness?
13833,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Is the wind changed? I'll veer about with it,"
13834,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,And meet him in all fashions.                           [_Aside_.
13835,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"All my leisure,"
13836,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Feebly bestow'd upon my kind friends here,"
13837,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Would not express a tithe of the obligements
13838,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,I every hour incur.
13839,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13840,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_.       No more of that.
13841,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"I know not why, my wife hath lost of late"
13842,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Much of her cheerful spirits.
13843,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13844,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Mrs. F._                It was my topic
13845,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"To-day; and every day, and all day long,"
13846,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"I still am chiding with her. ""Child,"" I said,"
13847,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,And said it pretty roundly--it may be
13848,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"I was too peremptory--we elder school-fellows,"
13849,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Presuming on the advantage of a year
13850,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Or two, which, in that tender time, seem'd much,"
13851,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"In after years, much like to elder sisters,"
13852,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Are prone to keep the authoritative style,"
13853,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,When time has made the difference most ridiculous--
13854,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13855,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_. The observation's shrewd.
13856,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13857,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Mrs. F._             ""Child,"" I was saying,"
13858,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"""If some wives had obtain'd a lot like yours,"""
13859,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"And then perhaps I sigh'd, ""they would not sit"
13860,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"In corners moping, like to sullen moppets,"
13861,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"That want their will, but dry their eyes, and look"
13862,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Their cheerful husbands in the face,"" perhaps"
13863,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"I said, their Selbys, ""with proportion'd looks"
13864,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Of honest joy."""
13865,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13866,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_.     You do suspect no jealousy?
13867,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13868,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Mrs. F._ What is his import? Whereto tends his Speech?
13869,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,[_Aside_.
13870,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Of whom, or what, should she be jealous, sir?"
13871,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13872,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Selby_. I do not know, but women have their fancies;"
13873,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"And underneath a cold indifference,"
13874,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Or show of some distaste, husbands have mask'd"
13875,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"A growing fondness for a female friend,"
13876,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Which the wife's eye was sharp enough to see,"
13877,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Before the friend had wit to find it out.
13878,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,You do not quit us soon?
13879,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13880,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Mrs. F._          'Tis as I find;
13881,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Your Katherine profits by my lessons, sir.--"

13884,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Selby_. She cannot choose.--Well, well, I have been thinking,"

13887,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Mrs. F._ What matter, sir?"

13891,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"I might have made, I do not say a better,"

13902,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13903,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Mrs. F._        Were you free to choose,"

13907,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13908,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_. I like your humor and will meet your jest.
13909,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,She should be one about my Katherine's age;
13910,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"But not so old, by some ten years, in gravity,"
13911,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"One that would meet my mirth, sometimes outrun it:"
13912,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"No muling, pining moppet, as you said,"
13913,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Nor moping maid that I must still be teaching
13914,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,The freedoms of a wife all her life after:
13915,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"But one that, having worn the chain before,"
13916,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"(And worn it lightly, as report gave out,)"
13917,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Enfranchised from it by her poor fool's death,"

13919,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"To die myself, for fear a second time"
13920,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,To wet a widow's eye.

13932,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Mrs. F._                                As one,"
13933,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"In European customs bred, must judge. Had I"
13934,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Been born a native of the liberal East,"
13935,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,I might have thought as they do. Yet I knew
13936,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"A married man that took a second wife,"

13971,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Of the house affairs; and, some slight toys excepted,"

13973,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13974,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_. A tale full of dramatic incident!--
13975,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"And if a man should put it in a play,"
13976,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,How should he name the parties?
13977,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,

13981,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Was--not unlike to _that_ your Katherine bore,"

13983,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
13984,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_. A dangerous meaning in your riddle lurks.
13985,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"One knot is yet unsolved; that told, this strange"
13986,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,And most mysterious drama ends. The name

13998,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Lucy_. From your poor Katherine's chamber, where she droops"
13999,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"In sad presageful thoughts, and sighs, and weeps,"
14000,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,And seems to pray by turns. At times she looks

14002,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Then starts, as I have seen her, at the mention"
14003,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Of some immodest act. At her request,"
14004,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,I left her on her knees.
14005,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14006,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_.            The fittest posture;

14008,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"She married me with a first husband living,"
14009,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Or not known not to be so, which, in the judgment"
14010,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Of any but indifferent honesty,"
14011,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Must be esteem'd the same. The shallow Widow,"
14012,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Caught by my art, under a riddling veil"
14013,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Too thin to hide her meaning, hath confess'd all."

14015,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,When she was ripe to tell the fatal _name_
14016,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,That seals my wedded doom.
14017,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14018,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Lucy_.               Was she so forward
14019,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,To pour her hateful meanings in your ear
14020,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,At the first hint?
14021,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14022,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_.      Her newly flatter'd hopes
14023,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Array'd themselves at first in forms of doubt;
14024,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,And with a female caution she stood off
14025,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Awhile, to read the meaning of my suit,"
14026,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Which with such honest seeming I enforced,"
14027,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,That her cold scruples soon gave way; and now
14028,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"She rests prepared, as mistress, or as wife,"
14029,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,To seize the place of her betrayèd friend--
14030,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"My much offending, but more suffering, Katherine."
14031,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14032,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Lucy_. Into what labyrinth of fearful shapes
14033,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,My simple project has conducted you--
14034,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Were but my wit as skilful to invent
14035,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,A clue to lead you forth!--I call to mind
14036,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"A letter, which your wife received from the Cape,"
14037,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Soon after you were married, with some circumstances"
14038,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Of mystery too.
14039,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14040,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_.   I well remember it.
14041,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,That letter did confirm the truth (she said)
14042,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Of a friend's death, which she had long fear'd true,"
14043,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,But knew not for a fact. A youth of promise
14044,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,She gave him out--a hot adventurous spirit--
14045,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"That had set sail in quest of golden dreams,"
14046,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,And cities in the heart of Central Afric;
14047,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"But named no names, nor did I care to press"
14048,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"My question further, in the passionate grief"
14049,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,She show'd at the receipt. Might this be he?
14050,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14051,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Lucy_. Tears were not all. When that first shower was past,"
14052,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"With clasp'd hands she raised her eyes to Heav'n,"
14053,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"As if in thankfulness for some escape,"
14054,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Or strange deliverance, in the news implied,"
14055,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Which sweeten'd that sad news.
14056,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14057,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Selby_.                 Something of that
14058,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,I noted also--
14059,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14060,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Lucy_.   In her closet once,"
14061,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Seeking some other trifle, I espied"
14062,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"A ring, in mournful characters deciphering"
14063,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"The death of ""Robert Halford, aged two"

14065,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"To the confident use of wagers, which I hold"
14066,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,Unseemly in a woman's argument;
14067,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,But I am strangely tempted now to risk
14068,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"A thousand pounds out of my patrimony,"
14069,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"(And let my future husband look to it,"
14070,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"If it be lost,) that this immodest Widow"

14072,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14073,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Selby_. That wager lost, I should be rich indeed--"
14074,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Rich in my rescued Kate--rich in my honor,"
14075,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Which now was bankrupt. Sister, I accept"
14076,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Your merry wager, with an aching heart"
14077,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,For very fear of winning. 'Tis the hour
14078,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"That I should meet my Widow in the walk,"
14079,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,The south side of the garden. On some pretence
14080,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Lure forth my Wife that way, that she may witness"

14082,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"Yourselves unseen; and by some sign I'll give,"

14084,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"You'll know your wager won--then break upon us,"
14085,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,As if by chance.
14086,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14087,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,_Lucy_.     I apprehend your meaning--
14088,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,
14089,MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.,"_Selby_. And may you prove a true Cassandra here,"

14114,MRS. FRAMPTON. KATHERINE.,
14115,MRS. FRAMPTON. KATHERINE.,"_Mrs. F._ Yes, courted me to stay, waived all objections,"
