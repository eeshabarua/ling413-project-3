60,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
61,PREFACE.,
62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,This is an age of anthologies. Collections of poetry covering a wide
64,PREFACE.,"range of subjects have appeared of late, and seem to have met with"
65,PREFACE.,"favor and approval. Not to the busy man only, but to the student of"
66,PREFACE.,literature such compilations are of value. It is sometimes objected
67,PREFACE.,that they tend to discourage wide reading and original research; but
68,PREFACE.,the overwhelming flood of books would seem to make them a necessity.
69,PREFACE.,"Unless one has the rare gift of being able to sprint through a book,"
70,PREFACE.,"as Andrew Lang says Mr. Gladstone does, it is surely well to make"
71,PREFACE.,use of the labors of the industrious compiler. Such collections are
72,PREFACE.,often the result of wide reading and patient labor. Frequently the
73,PREFACE.,"larger part is made up of single poems, the happy and perhaps only"
74,PREFACE.,"inspiration of the writer, gleaned from the poet's corner of the"
75,PREFACE.,newspaper or the pages of a magazine. This is specially true of the
76,PREFACE.,"present compilation, the first on the subject aiming at anything like"
77,PREFACE.,completeness. Brief collections of prose and poetry combined have
78,PREFACE.,already been published; but so much of value has been omitted that
79,PREFACE.,there seemed to be room for a better book. A vast amount has been
80,PREFACE.,"written in praise of tobacco, much of it commonplace or lacking in"
81,PREFACE.,poetic quality. While some of the verse here gathered is an obvious
82,PREFACE.,"echo, or passes into unmistakable parody, it has been the aim of"
83,PREFACE.,"the compiler to maintain, as far as possible, a high standard and"
84,PREFACE.,include only the best. From the days of Raleigh to the present
85,PREFACE.,"time, literature abounds in allusions to tobacco. The Elizabethan"
86,PREFACE.,"writers constantly refer to it, often in praise though sometimes"
87,PREFACE.,"in condemnation. The incoming of the ""Indian weed"" created a great"
88,PREFACE.,"furore, and scarcely any other of the New World discoveries was talked"
89,PREFACE.,"about so much. Ben Jonson, Marlowe, Fletcher, Spenser, Dekker, and"
90,PREFACE.,"many other of the poets and dramatists of the time, make frequent"
91,PREFACE.,"reference to it; and no doubt at the Mermaid tavern, pipes and tobacco"
92,PREFACE.,"found a place beside the sack and ale. Singular to say, Shakespeare"
93,PREFACE.,"makes no reference to it; and only once in his essay ""Of Plantations,"""
94,PREFACE.,"as far as the compiler has been able to discover, does Bacon speak"
95,PREFACE.,of it. Shakespeare's silence has been explained on the theory that
96,PREFACE.,he could not introduce any reference to the newly discovered plant
97,PREFACE.,without anachronism; but he did not often let a little thing of this
98,PREFACE.,"kind stand in his way. It has been suggested, on the other hand, that"
99,PREFACE.,"he avoided all reference to it out of deference to King James I.,"
100,PREFACE.,"who wrote the famous ""Counterblast."" Whichever theory is correct,"
101,PREFACE.,"the fact remains, and it may be an interesting contribution to the"
102,PREFACE.,Bacon-Shakespeare controversy. Queen Elizabeth never showed any
103,PREFACE.,"hostility to tobacco; but her successors, James I. and the two"
104,PREFACE.,"Charleses, and Cromwell were its bitter opponents. Notwithstanding"
105,PREFACE.,"its enemies, who just as fiercely opposed the introduction of tea"
106,PREFACE.,"and coffee, its use spread over Europe and the world, and prince"
107,PREFACE.,and peasant alike yielded to its mild but irresistible sway. Poets
108,PREFACE.,"and philosophers drew solace and inspiration from the pipe. Milton,"
109,PREFACE.,"Addison, Fielding, Hobbes, and Newton were all smokers. It is said"
110,PREFACE.,Newton was smoking under a tree in his garden when the historic apple
111,PREFACE.,"fell. Scott, Campbell, Byron, Hood, and Lamb all smoked, and Carlyle"
112,PREFACE.,and Tennyson were rarely without a pipe in their mouths. The great
113,PREFACE.,"novelists, Thackeray, Dickens, and Bulwer were famous smokers; and so"
114,PREFACE.,"were the great soldiers, Napoleon, Bl√ºcher, and Grant. While nearly"
115,PREFACE.,"all the poems here gathered together were written, and perhaps could"
116,PREFACE.,"only have been written, by smokers, several among the best are the"
117,PREFACE.,"work of authors who never use the weed,--one by a man, two or three"
118,PREFACE.,by women. Among the more recent writers there has been no more devoted
119,PREFACE.,"smoker than Mr. Lowell, as his recently published letters testify."
120,PREFACE.,"Three of the most delightful poems in praise of smoking are his, and"
121,PREFACE.,"with Mr. Aldrich's charming ""Latakia"" are the gems of the collection."
122,PREFACE.,The compiler desires to express his grateful acknowledgments to
123,PREFACE.,friends who have permitted him to use their work and have otherwise
124,PREFACE.,aided him from time to time; and to the many unknown authors whose
125,PREFACE.,"poems are here gathered, and whom it was quite impossible to reach;"
126,PREFACE.,"and to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Company, Harper & Brothers, The"
127,PREFACE.,"Bowen-Merrill Company, and the publishers of ""Outlook,"" for their"
128,PREFACE.,gracious permission to include copyrighted poems.
