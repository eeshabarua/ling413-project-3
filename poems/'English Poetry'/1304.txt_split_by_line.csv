26,PREFACE,PREFACE
27,PREFACE,
28,PREFACE,FOR this Anthology I have tried to range over the whole field of
29,PREFACE,"English Verse from the beginning, or from the Thirteenth Century"
30,PREFACE,"to this closing year of the Nineteenth, and to choose the best."
31,PREFACE,"Nor have I sought in these Islands only, but wheresoever the Muse"
32,PREFACE,has followed the tongue which among living tongues she most
33,PREFACE,delights to honour. To bring home and render so great a spoil
34,PREFACE,compendiously has been my capital difficulty. It is for the reader
35,PREFACE,to judge if I have so managed it as to serve those who already
36,PREFACE,love poetry and to implant that love in some young minds not yet
37,PREFACE,initiated.
38,PREFACE,
39,PREFACE,My scheme is simple. I have arranged the poets as nearly as
40,PREFACE,"possible in order of birth, with such groupings of anonymous"
41,PREFACE,"pieces as seemed convenient. For convenience, too, as well as to"
42,PREFACE,"avoid a dispute-royal, I have gathered the most of the Ballads"
43,PREFACE,into the middle of the Seventeenth Century; where they fill a
44,PREFACE,languid interval between two winds of inspiration--the Italian
45,PREFACE,dying down with Milton and the French following at the heels of
46,PREFACE,"the restored Royalists. For convenience, again, I have set myself"
47,PREFACE,certain rules of spelling. In the very earliest poems inflection
48,PREFACE,"and spelling are structural, and to modernize is to destroy. But"
49,PREFACE,as old inflections fade into modern the old spelling becomes less
50,PREFACE,"and less vital, and has been brought (not, I hope, too abruptly)"
51,PREFACE,into line with that sanctioned by use and familiar. To do this
52,PREFACE,seemed wiser than to discourage many readers for the sake of
53,PREFACE,diverting others by a scent of antiquity which--to be essential--
54,PREFACE,should breathe of something rarer than an odd arrangement of type.
55,PREFACE,But there are scholars whom I cannot expect to agree with me; and
56,PREFACE,to conciliate them I have excepted Spenser and Milton from the
57,PREFACE,rule.
58,PREFACE,
59,PREFACE,Glosses of archaic and otherwise difficult words are given at
60,PREFACE,the foot of the page: but the text has not been disfigured with
61,PREFACE,reference-marks. And rather than make the book unwieldy I have
62,PREFACE,eschewed notes--reluctantly when some obscure passage or allusion
63,PREFACE,seemed to ask for a timely word; with more equanimity when the
64,PREFACE,temptation was to criticize or 'appreciate.' For the function of
65,PREFACE,the anthologist includes criticizing in silence.
66,PREFACE,
67,PREFACE,Care has been taken with the texts. But I have sometimes thought
68,PREFACE,it consistent with the aim of the book to prefer the more
69,PREFACE,beautiful to the better attested reading. I have often excised
70,PREFACE,weak or superfluous stanzas when sure that excision would improve;
71,PREFACE,and have not hesitated to extract a few stanzas from a long poem
72,PREFACE,when persuaded that they could stand alone as a lyric. The apology
73,PREFACE,for such experiments can only lie in their success: but the risk
74,PREFACE,"is one which, in my judgement, the anthologist ought to take. A"
75,PREFACE,"few small corrections have been made, but only when they were"
76,PREFACE,quite obvious.
77,PREFACE,
78,PREFACE,The numbers chosen are either lyrical or epigrammatic. Indeed I
79,PREFACE,am mistaken if a single epigram included fails to preserve at
80,PREFACE,least some faint thrill of the emotion through which it had to
81,PREFACE,"pass before the Muse's lips let it fall, with however exquisite"
82,PREFACE,deliberation. But the lyrical spirit is volatile and notoriously
83,PREFACE,hard to bind with definitions; and seems to grow wilder with the
84,PREFACE,years. With the anthologist--as with the fisherman who knows the
85,PREFACE,"fish at the end of his sea-line--the gift, if he have it, comes by"
86,PREFACE,"sense, improved by practice. The definition, if he be clever"
87,PREFACE,"enough to frame one, comes by after-thought. I don't know that it"
88,PREFACE,"helps, and am sure that it may easily mislead."
89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,"Having set my heart on choosing the best, I resolved not to be"
91,PREFACE,dissuaded by common objections against anthologies--that they
92,PREFACE,repeat one another until the proverb [Greek] loses all
93,PREFACE,application--or perturbed if my judgement should often agree with
94,PREFACE,"that of good critics. The best is the best, though a hundred"
95,PREFACE,judges have declared it so; nor had it been any feat to search out
96,PREFACE,and insert the second-rate merely because it happened to be
97,PREFACE,"recondite. To be sure, a man must come to such a task as mine"
98,PREFACE,haunted by his youth and the favourites he loved in days when he
99,PREFACE,had much enthusiasm but little reading.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,A deeper import
102,PREFACE,Lurks in the legend told my infant years
103,PREFACE,Than lies upon that truth we live to learn.
104,PREFACE,
105,PREFACE,Few of my contemporaries can erase--or would wish to erase--the
106,PREFACE,dye their minds took from the late Mr. Palgrave's Golden Treasury:
107,PREFACE,and he who has returned to it again and again with an affection
108,PREFACE,born of companionship on many journeys must remember not only what
109,PREFACE,"the Golden Treasury includes, but the moment when this or that"
110,PREFACE,"poem appealed to him, and even how it lies on the page. To Mr."
111,PREFACE,Bullen's Lyrics from the Elizabethan Song Books and his other
112,PREFACE,treasuries I own a more advised debt. Nor am I free of obligation
113,PREFACE,to anthologies even more recent--to Archbishop Trench's Household
114,PREFACE,"Book of Poetry, Mr. Locker-Lampson's Lyra Elegantiarum, Mr. Miles'"
115,PREFACE,"Poets and Poetry of the Century, Mr. Beeching's Paradise of"
116,PREFACE,"English Poetry, Mr. Henley's English Lyrics, Mrs. Sharp's Lyra"
117,PREFACE,"Celtica, Mr. Yeats' Book of Irish Verse, and Mr. Churton Collins'"
118,PREFACE,Treasury of Minor British Poetry: though my rule has been to
119,PREFACE,consult these after making my own choice. Yet I can claim that the
120,PREFACE,help derived from them--though gratefully owned--bears but a
121,PREFACE,"trifling proportion to the labour, special and desultory, which"
122,PREFACE,has gone to the making of my book.
123,PREFACE,
124,PREFACE,For the anthologist's is not quite the dilettante business for
125,PREFACE,"which it is too often and ignorantly derided. I say this, and"
126,PREFACE,immediately repent; since my wish is that the reader should in his
127,PREFACE,"own pleasure quite forget the editor's labour, which too has been"
128,PREFACE,"pleasant: that, standing aside, I may believe this book has made"
129,PREFACE,"the Muses' access easier when, in the right hour, they come to him"
130,PREFACE,to uplift or to console--
131,PREFACE,[Greek]

133,PREFACE,My thanks are here tendered to those who have helped me with

173,PREFACE,"Thomson but to use a poem of Traherne's, a seventeenth-century"
174,PREFACE,singer rediscovered by him. To mention all who in other ways have
175,PREFACE,"furthered me is not possible in this short Preface; which,"
176,PREFACE,"however, must not conclude without a word of special thanks to Dr."
177,PREFACE,W. Robertson Nicoll for many suggestions and some pains kindly
178,PREFACE,"bestowed, and to Professor F. York Powell, whose help and wise"
179,PREFACE,"counsel have been as generously given as they were eagerly sought,"
180,PREFACE,adding me to the number of those many who have found his learning
181,PREFACE,to be his friends' good fortune.

1571,3. ESCAPE,"Affirming this, how that it is"
1572,3. ESCAPE,A labour spent in vain

1574,3. ESCAPE,They love a man again:
1575,3. ESCAPE,For let a man do what he can

1577,3. ESCAPE,"Yet if a new to them pursue,"
1578,3. ESCAPE,Their first true lover than
1579,3. ESCAPE,Laboureth for naught; for from her thought
1580,3. ESCAPE,He is a banished man.
1581,3. ESCAPE,
1582,3. ESCAPE,"She. I say not nay, but that all day"
1583,3. ESCAPE,It is both written and said
1584,3. ESCAPE,"That woman's faith is, as who saith,"
1585,3. ESCAPE,All utterly decayd:
1586,3. ESCAPE,"But nevertheless, right good witness"
1587,3. ESCAPE,In this case might be laid
1588,3. ESCAPE,That they love true and continue:

1590,3. ESCAPE,"Which, when her love came her to prove,"
1591,3. ESCAPE,"To her to make his moan,"
1592,3. ESCAPE,Would not depart; for in her heart
1593,3. ESCAPE,She loved but him alone.
1594,3. ESCAPE,
1595,3. ESCAPE,He. Then between us let us discuss
1596,3. ESCAPE,What was all the manere

1603,3. ESCAPE,"I am the Knight. I come by night,"

1606,3. ESCAPE,I am a banished man.
1607,3. ESCAPE,
1608,3. ESCAPE,She. And I your will for to fulfil
1609,3. ESCAPE,In this will not refuse;
1610,3. ESCAPE,"Trusting to show, in wordes few,"
1611,3. ESCAPE,That men have an ill use--
1612,3. ESCAPE,"To their own shame--women to blame,"
1613,3. ESCAPE,And causeless them accuse.
1614,3. ESCAPE,"Therefore to you I answer now,"
1615,3. ESCAPE,All women to excuse--

1623,3. ESCAPE,My destiny is for to die
1624,3. ESCAPE,"A shameful death, I trow;"
1625,3. ESCAPE,Or else to flee. The t' one must be.
1626,3. ESCAPE,None other way I know
1627,3. ESCAPE,"But to withdraw as an outlaw,"
1628,3. ESCAPE,And take me to my bow.
1629,3. ESCAPE,"Wherefore adieu, mine own heart true!"
1630,3. ESCAPE,None other rede I can:
1631,3. ESCAPE,"For I must to the green-wood go,"
1632,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."

1645,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1646,3. ESCAPE,
1647,3. ESCAPE,"He. I can believe it shall you grieve,"
1648,3. ESCAPE,And somewhat you distrain;
1649,3. ESCAPE,"But afterward, your paines hard"
1650,3. ESCAPE,Within a day or twain
1651,3. ESCAPE,Shall soon aslake; and ye shall take
1652,3. ESCAPE,Comfort to you again.
1653,3. ESCAPE,"Why should ye ought? for, to make thought,"
1654,3. ESCAPE,Your labour were in vain.
1655,3. ESCAPE,"And thus I do; and pray you to,"
1656,3. ESCAPE,As hartely as I can:
1657,3. ESCAPE,"For I must to the green-wood go,"
1658,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1659,3. ESCAPE,
1660,3. ESCAPE,"She. Now, sith that ye have showed to me"
1661,3. ESCAPE,"The secret of your mind,"
1662,3. ESCAPE,"I shall be plain to you again,"
1663,3. ESCAPE,Like as ye shall me find.
1664,3. ESCAPE,"Sith it is so that ye will go,"
1665,3. ESCAPE,I will not live behind.
1666,3. ESCAPE,Shall never be said the Nut-brown Maid
1667,3. ESCAPE,Was to her love unkind.
1668,3. ESCAPE,"Make you ready, for so am I,"
1669,3. ESCAPE,Although it were anone:
1670,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1671,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1672,3. ESCAPE,
1673,3. ESCAPE,He. Yet I you rede to take good heed
1674,3. ESCAPE,What men will think and say:
1675,3. ESCAPE,"Of young, of old, it shall be told"
1676,3. ESCAPE,That ye be gone away
1677,3. ESCAPE,"Your wanton will for to fulfil,"
1678,3. ESCAPE,In green-wood you to play;
1679,3. ESCAPE,And that ye might for your delight
1680,3. ESCAPE,No longer make delay
1681,3. ESCAPE,Rather than ye should thus for me
1682,3. ESCAPE,Be called an ill woman
1683,3. ESCAPE,"Yet would I to the green-wood go,"
1684,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1685,3. ESCAPE,
1686,3. ESCAPE,She. Though it be sung of old and young
1687,3. ESCAPE,"That I should be to blame,"
1688,3. ESCAPE,Theirs be the charge that speak so large
1689,3. ESCAPE,In hurting of my name:
1690,3. ESCAPE,For I will prove that faithful love
1691,3. ESCAPE,It is devoid of shame;
1692,3. ESCAPE,In your distress and heaviness
1693,3. ESCAPE,To part with you the same:
1694,3. ESCAPE,And sure all tho that do not so
1695,3. ESCAPE,True lovers are they none:
1696,3. ESCAPE,"For in my mind, of all mankind"
1697,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1698,3. ESCAPE,
1699,3. ESCAPE,"He. I counsel you, Remember how"
1700,3. ESCAPE,It is no maiden's law
1701,3. ESCAPE,"Nothing to doubt, but to run out"
1702,3. ESCAPE,To wood with an outlaw.
1703,3. ESCAPE,For ye must there in your hand bear
1704,3. ESCAPE,A bow ready to draw;
1705,3. ESCAPE,And as a thief thus must you live
1706,3. ESCAPE,Ever in dread and awe;
1707,3. ESCAPE,Whereby to you great harm might grow:
1708,3. ESCAPE,Yet had I liever than
1709,3. ESCAPE,"That I had to the green-wood go,"
1710,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1711,3. ESCAPE,
1712,3. ESCAPE,She. I think not nay but as ye say;
1713,3. ESCAPE,It is no maiden's lore;
1714,3. ESCAPE,"But love may make me for your sake,"
1715,3. ESCAPE,"As I have said before,"
1716,3. ESCAPE,"To come on foot, to hunt and shoot,"
1717,3. ESCAPE,To get us meat and store;
1718,3. ESCAPE,For so that I your company
1719,3. ESCAPE,"May have, I ask no more."
1720,3. ESCAPE,From which to part it maketh my heart
1721,3. ESCAPE,As cold as any stone;
1722,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1723,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1724,3. ESCAPE,
1725,3. ESCAPE,"He. For an outlaw this is the law,"
1726,3. ESCAPE,That men him take and bind:
1727,3. ESCAPE,"Without pitie, hanged to be,"
1728,3. ESCAPE,And waver with the wind.
1729,3. ESCAPE,If I had need (as God forbede!)
1730,3. ESCAPE,What socours could ye find?
1731,3. ESCAPE,"Forsooth I trow, you and your bow"
1732,3. ESCAPE,For fear would draw behind.
1733,3. ESCAPE,And no mervail; for little avail
1734,3. ESCAPE,Were in your counsel than:
1735,3. ESCAPE,"Wherefore I'll to the green-wood go,"
1736,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1737,3. ESCAPE,
1738,3. ESCAPE,She. Right well know ye that women be
1739,3. ESCAPE,But feeble for to fight;
1740,3. ESCAPE,"No womanhede it is, indeed,"
1741,3. ESCAPE,To be bold as a knight:
1742,3. ESCAPE,Yet in such fear if that ye were
1743,3. ESCAPE,"With enemies day and night,"
1744,3. ESCAPE,"I would withstand, with bow in hand,"
1745,3. ESCAPE,"To grieve them as I might,"
1746,3. ESCAPE,And you to save; as women have
1747,3. ESCAPE,From death men many one:
1748,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1749,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1750,3. ESCAPE,
1751,3. ESCAPE,He. Yet take good hede; for ever I drede
1752,3. ESCAPE,That ye could not sustain
1753,3. ESCAPE,"The thorny ways, the deep valleys,"
1754,3. ESCAPE,"The snow, the frost, the rain,"
1755,3. ESCAPE,"The cold, the heat; for dry or wete,"
1756,3. ESCAPE,We must lodge on the plain;
1757,3. ESCAPE,"And, us above, no other roof"
1758,3. ESCAPE,But a brake bush or twain:
1759,3. ESCAPE,"Which soon should grieve you, I believe;"
1760,3. ESCAPE,And ye would gladly than
1761,3. ESCAPE,"That I had to the green-wood go,"
1762,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1763,3. ESCAPE,
1764,3. ESCAPE,She. Sith I have here been partynere
1765,3. ESCAPE,"With you of joy and bliss,"
1766,3. ESCAPE,I must alsò part of your woe
1767,3. ESCAPE,"Endure, as reason is:"
1768,3. ESCAPE,"Yet I am sure of one pleasure,"
1769,3. ESCAPE,And shortly it is this--
1770,3. ESCAPE,"That where ye be, me seemeth, parde,"
1771,3. ESCAPE,I could not fare amiss.
1772,3. ESCAPE,Without more speech I you beseech
1773,3. ESCAPE,That we were shortly gone;
1774,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1775,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1776,3. ESCAPE,
1777,3. ESCAPE,"He. If ye go thyder, ye must consider,"
1778,3. ESCAPE,"When ye have lust to dine,"
1779,3. ESCAPE,"There shall no meat be for to gete,"
1780,3. ESCAPE,"Nether bere, ale, ne wine,"
1781,3. ESCAPE,"Ne shetes clean, to lie between,"
1782,3. ESCAPE,Made of thread and twine;
1783,3. ESCAPE,"None other house, but leaves and boughs,"
1784,3. ESCAPE,To cover your head and mine.
1785,3. ESCAPE,"Lo, mine heart sweet, this ill diete"
1786,3. ESCAPE,Should make you pale and wan:
1787,3. ESCAPE,"Wherefore I'll to the green-wood go,"
1788,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1789,3. ESCAPE,
1790,3. ESCAPE,"She. Among the wild deer such an archere,"
1791,3. ESCAPE,"As men say that ye be,"
1792,3. ESCAPE,Ne may not fail of good vitayle
1793,3. ESCAPE,Where is so great plentè
1794,3. ESCAPE,And water clear of the rivere
1795,3. ESCAPE,Shall be full sweet to me;
1796,3. ESCAPE,With which in hele I shall right wele
1797,3. ESCAPE,"Endure, as ye shall see;"
1798,3. ESCAPE,"And, or we go, a bed or two"
1799,3. ESCAPE,I can provide anone;
1800,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1801,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1802,3. ESCAPE,
1803,3. ESCAPE,"He. Lo yet, before, ye must do more,"
1804,3. ESCAPE,If ye will go with me:
1805,3. ESCAPE,"As, cut your hair up by your ear,"
1806,3. ESCAPE,Your kirtle by the knee;
1807,3. ESCAPE,With bow in hand for to withstand
1808,3. ESCAPE,"Your enemies, if need be:"
1809,3. ESCAPE,"And this same night, before daylight,"
1810,3. ESCAPE,To woodward will I flee.
1811,3. ESCAPE,"If that ye will all this fulfil,"
1812,3. ESCAPE,Do it shortly as ye can:
1813,3. ESCAPE,"Else will I to the green-wood go,"
1814,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1815,3. ESCAPE,
1816,3. ESCAPE,She. I shall as now do more for you
1817,3. ESCAPE,Than 'longeth to womanhede;
1818,3. ESCAPE,"To short my hair, a bow to bear,"
1819,3. ESCAPE,To shoot in time of need.
1820,3. ESCAPE,O my sweet mother! before all other
1821,3. ESCAPE,For you I have most drede!
1822,3. ESCAPE,"But now, adieu! I must ensue"
1823,3. ESCAPE,Where fortune doth me lead.
1824,3. ESCAPE,All this make ye: Now let us flee;
1825,3. ESCAPE,The day cometh fast upon:
1826,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1827,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1828,3. ESCAPE,
1829,3. ESCAPE,"He. Nay, nay, not so; ye shall not go,"
1830,3. ESCAPE,And I shall tell you why--
1831,3. ESCAPE,Your appetite is to be light
1832,3. ESCAPE,"Of love, I well espy:"
1833,3. ESCAPE,"For, right as ye have said to me,"
1834,3. ESCAPE,In likewise hardily
1835,3. ESCAPE,"Ye would answere whosoever it were,"
1836,3. ESCAPE,In way of company:
1837,3. ESCAPE,"It is said of old, Soon hot, soon cold;"
1838,3. ESCAPE,And so is a woman:
1839,3. ESCAPE,"Wherefore I to the wood will go,"
1840,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1841,3. ESCAPE,
1842,3. ESCAPE,"She. If ye take heed, it is no need"
1843,3. ESCAPE,Such words to say to me;
1844,3. ESCAPE,"For oft ye prayed, and long assayed,"
1845,3. ESCAPE,"Or I loved you, parde:"
1846,3. ESCAPE,And though that I of ancestry
1847,3. ESCAPE,"A baron's daughter be,"
1848,3. ESCAPE,"Yet have you proved how I you loved,"
1849,3. ESCAPE,A squire of low degree;
1850,3. ESCAPE,"And ever shall, whatso befall"
1851,3. ESCAPE,To die therefore anone;
1852,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1853,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1854,3. ESCAPE,
1855,3. ESCAPE,"He. A baron's child to be beguiled,"
1856,3. ESCAPE,It were a cursed deed!
1857,3. ESCAPE,To be felaw with an outlaw--
1858,3. ESCAPE,Almighty God forbede!
1859,3. ESCAPE,Yet better were the poor squyere
1860,3. ESCAPE,Alone to forest yede
1861,3. ESCAPE,Than ye shall say another day
1862,3. ESCAPE,That by my cursed rede
1863,3. ESCAPE,"Ye were betrayed. Wherefore, good maid,"
1864,3. ESCAPE,"The best rede that I can,"
1865,3. ESCAPE,"Is, that I to the green-wood go,"
1866,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1867,3. ESCAPE,
1868,3. ESCAPE,"She. Whatever befall, I never shall"
1869,3. ESCAPE,Of this thing be upbraid:
1870,3. ESCAPE,"But if ye go, and leave me so,"
1871,3. ESCAPE,Then have ye me betrayed.
1872,3. ESCAPE,"Remember you wele, how that ye dele;"
1873,3. ESCAPE,"For if ye, as ye said,"
1874,3. ESCAPE,Be so unkind to leave behind
1875,3. ESCAPE,"Your love, the Nut-brown Maid,"
1876,3. ESCAPE,Trust me truly that I shall die
1877,3. ESCAPE,Soon after ye be gone:
1878,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1879,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1880,3. ESCAPE,
1881,3. ESCAPE,"He. If that ye went, ye should repent;"
1882,3. ESCAPE,For in the forest now
1883,3. ESCAPE,I have purveyed me of a maid
1884,3. ESCAPE,Whom I love more than you:
1885,3. ESCAPE,Another more fair than ever ye were
1886,3. ESCAPE,I dare it well avow;
1887,3. ESCAPE,And of you both each should be wroth
1888,3. ESCAPE,"With other, as I trow:"
1889,3. ESCAPE,It were mine ease to live in peace;
1890,3. ESCAPE,"So will I, if I can:"
1891,3. ESCAPE,"Wherefore I to the wood will go,"
1892,3. ESCAPE,"Alone, a banished man."
1893,3. ESCAPE,
1894,3. ESCAPE,She. Though in the wood I understood
1895,3. ESCAPE,"Ye had a paramour,"
1896,3. ESCAPE,"All this may nought remove my thought,"
1897,3. ESCAPE,But that I will be your':
1898,3. ESCAPE,And she shall find me soft and kind
1899,3. ESCAPE,And courteis every hour;
1900,3. ESCAPE,Glad to fulfil all that she will
1901,3. ESCAPE,"Command me, to my power:"
1902,3. ESCAPE,"For had ye, lo, an hundred mo,"
1903,3. ESCAPE,Yet would I be that one:
1904,3. ESCAPE,"For, in my mind, of all mankind"
1905,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.
1906,3. ESCAPE,
1907,3. ESCAPE,"He. Mine own dear love, I see the prove"
1908,3. ESCAPE,That ye be kind and true;
1909,3. ESCAPE,"Of maid, of wife, in all my life,"
1910,3. ESCAPE,The best that ever I knew.
1911,3. ESCAPE,Be merry and glad; be no more sad;
1912,3. ESCAPE,The case is changed new;
1913,3. ESCAPE,For it were ruth that for your truth
1914,3. ESCAPE,Ye should have cause to rue.
1915,3. ESCAPE,"Be not dismayed, whatsoever I said"
1916,3. ESCAPE,To you when I began:
1917,3. ESCAPE,I will not to the green-wood go;
1918,3. ESCAPE,I am no banished man.
1919,3. ESCAPE,
1920,3. ESCAPE,She. These tidings be more glad to me
1921,3. ESCAPE,"Than to be made a queen,"
1922,3. ESCAPE,If I were sure they should endure;
1923,3. ESCAPE,But it is often seen
1924,3. ESCAPE,When men will break promise they speak
1925,3. ESCAPE,The wordis on the splene.
1926,3. ESCAPE,"Ye shape some wile me to beguile,"
1927,3. ESCAPE,"And steal from me, I ween:"
1928,3. ESCAPE,"Then were the case worse than it was,"
1929,3. ESCAPE,And I more wo-begone:

1931,3. ESCAPE,I love but you alone.

7414,THRENOS,"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,"
7415,THRENOS,Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?

7817,THRENOS,
7818,THRENOS,"You curious chanters of the wood,"
7819,THRENOS,"That warble forth Dame Nature's lays,"
7820,THRENOS,Thinking your passions understood
7821,THRENOS,By your weak accents; what 's your praise
7822,THRENOS,When Philomel her voice shall raise?
7823,THRENOS,
7824,THRENOS,"You violets that first appear,"
7825,THRENOS,By your pure purple mantles known
7826,THRENOS,"Like the proud virgins of the year,"
7827,THRENOS,As if the spring were all your own;
7828,THRENOS,What are you when the rose is blown?
7829,THRENOS,
7830,THRENOS,"So, when my mistress shall be seen"
7831,THRENOS,"In form and beauty of her mind,"
7832,THRENOS,"By virtue first, then choice, a Queen,"
7833,THRENOS,"Tell me, if she were not design'd"
7834,THRENOS,Th' eclipse and glory of her kind.

7840,THRENOS,
7841,THRENOS,HOW happy is he born and taught
7842,THRENOS,That serveth not another's will;
7843,THRENOS,"Whose armour is his honest thought,"
7844,THRENOS,And simple truth his utmost skill!
7845,THRENOS,
7846,THRENOS,Whose passions not his masters are;
7847,THRENOS,"Whose soul is still prepared for death,"
7848,THRENOS,Untied unto the world by care
7849,THRENOS,Of public fame or private breath;
7850,THRENOS,
7851,THRENOS,"Who envies none that chance doth raise,"
7852,THRENOS,Nor vice; who never understood
7853,THRENOS,How deepest wounds are given by praise;
7854,THRENOS,"Nor rules of state, but rules of good;"
7855,THRENOS,
7856,THRENOS,Who hath his life from rumours freed;
7857,THRENOS,Whose conscience is his strong retreat;
7858,THRENOS,"Whose state can neither flatterers feed,"
7859,THRENOS,Nor ruin make oppressors great;
7860,THRENOS,
7861,THRENOS,Who God doth late and early pray
7862,THRENOS,More of His grace than gifts to lend;
7863,THRENOS,And entertains the harmless day
7864,THRENOS,With a religious book or friend;
7865,THRENOS,
7866,THRENOS,--This man is freed from servile bands
7867,THRENOS,Of hope to rise or fear to fall:

7883,THRENOS,
7884,THRENOS,"I KNOW my soul hath power to know all things,"
7885,THRENOS,Yet she is blind and ignorant in all:
7886,THRENOS,"I know I'm one of Nature's little kings,"
7887,THRENOS,Yet to the least and vilest things am thrall.
7888,THRENOS,
7889,THRENOS,I know my life 's a pain and but a span;
7890,THRENOS,I know my sense is mock'd in everything;
7891,THRENOS,"And, to conclude, I know myself a Man--"

7898,THRENOS,
7899,THRENOS,"I DO confess thou'rt smooth and fair,"
7900,THRENOS,"And I might have gone near to love thee,"
7901,THRENOS,Had I not found the slightest prayer
7902,THRENOS,"That lips could move, had power to move thee;"
7903,THRENOS,But I can let thee now alone
7904,THRENOS,As worthy to be loved by none.
7905,THRENOS,
7906,THRENOS,I do confess thou'rt sweet; yet find
7907,THRENOS,"Thee such an unthrift of thy sweets,"
7908,THRENOS,Thy favours are but like the wind
7909,THRENOS,That kisseth everything it meets:
7910,THRENOS,"And since thou canst with more than one,"
7911,THRENOS,Thou'rt worthy to be kiss'd by none.
7912,THRENOS,
7913,THRENOS,The morning rose that untouch'd stands
7914,THRENOS,"Arm'd with her briers, how sweet she smells!"
7915,THRENOS,"But pluck'd and strain'd through ruder hands,"
7916,THRENOS,Her sweets no longer with her dwells:
7917,THRENOS,"But scent and beauty both are gone,"
7918,THRENOS,"And leaves fall from her, one by one."
7919,THRENOS,
7920,THRENOS,Such fate ere long will thee betide
7921,THRENOS,"When thou hast handled been awhile,"
7922,THRENOS,With sere flowers to be thrown aside;
7923,THRENOS,"And I shall sigh, while some will smile,"
7924,THRENOS,To see thy love to every one
7925,THRENOS,Hath brought thee to be loved by none.

7930,THRENOS,183. To an Inconstant One
7931,THRENOS,
7932,THRENOS,I LOVED thee once; I'll love no more--
7933,THRENOS,Thine be the grief as is the blame;
7934,THRENOS,"Thou art not what thou wast before,"
7935,THRENOS,What reason I should be the same?
7936,THRENOS,"He that can love unloved again,"
7937,THRENOS,Hath better store of love than brain:
7938,THRENOS,"God send me love my debts to pay,"
7939,THRENOS,While unthrifts fool their love away!
7940,THRENOS,
7941,THRENOS,Nothing could have my love o'erthrown
7942,THRENOS,If thou hadst still continued mine;
7943,THRENOS,"Yea, if thou hadst remain'd thy own,"
7944,THRENOS,I might perchance have yet been thine.
7945,THRENOS,But thou thy freedom didst recall
7946,THRENOS,That it thou might elsewhere enthral:
7947,THRENOS,And then how could I but disdain
7948,THRENOS,A captive's captive to remain?
7949,THRENOS,
7950,THRENOS,When new desires had conquer'd thee
7951,THRENOS,"And changed the object of thy will,"
7952,THRENOS,"It had been lethargy in me,"
7953,THRENOS,"Not constancy, to love thee still."
7954,THRENOS,"Yea, it had been a sin to go"
7955,THRENOS,And prostitute affection so:
7956,THRENOS,Since we are taught no prayers to say
7957,THRENOS,To such as must to others pray.
7958,THRENOS,
7959,THRENOS,Yet do thou glory in thy choice--
7960,THRENOS,Thy choice of his good fortune boast;
7961,THRENOS,I'll neither grieve nor yet rejoice
7962,THRENOS,To see him gain what I have lost:
7963,THRENOS,The height of my disdain shall be
7964,THRENOS,"To laugh at him, to blush for thee;"
7965,THRENOS,"To love thee still, but go no more"
7966,THRENOS,A-begging at a beggar's door.

7978,THRENOS,Goddess excellently bright.
7979,THRENOS,
7980,THRENOS,"Earth, let not thy envious shade"
7981,THRENOS,Dare itself to interpose;
7982,THRENOS,Cynthia's shining orb was made

7984,THRENOS,"Bless us then with wished sight,"
7985,THRENOS,Goddess excellently bright.
7986,THRENOS,
7987,THRENOS,"Lay thy bow of pearl apart,"
7988,THRENOS,And thy crystal-shining quiver;
7989,THRENOS,Give unto the flying hart

7998,THRENOS,
7999,THRENOS,"DRINK to me only with thine eyes,"
8000,THRENOS,And I will pledge with mine;
8001,THRENOS,Or leave a kiss but in the cup
8002,THRENOS,And I'll not look for wine.
8003,THRENOS,The thirst that from the soul doth rise
8004,THRENOS,Doth ask a drink divine;
8005,THRENOS,"But might I of Jove's nectar sup,"
8006,THRENOS,I would not change for thine.
8007,THRENOS,
8008,THRENOS,"I sent thee late a rosy wreath,"
8009,THRENOS,Not so much honouring thee
8010,THRENOS,As giving it a hope that there
8011,THRENOS,It could not wither'd be;
8012,THRENOS,"But thou thereon didst only breathe,"
8013,THRENOS,And sent'st it back to me;
8014,THRENOS,"Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,"
8015,THRENOS,Not of itself but thee!

8024,THRENOS,"Still to be powder'd, still perfumed:"
8025,THRENOS,"Lady, it is to be presumed,"
8026,THRENOS,"Though art's hid causes are not found,"
8027,THRENOS,"All is not sweet, all is not sound."
8028,THRENOS,
8029,THRENOS,"Give me a look, give me a face"
8030,THRENOS,That makes simplicity a grace;
8031,THRENOS,"Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:"
8032,THRENOS,Such sweet neglect more taketh me
8033,THRENOS,Than all th' adulteries of art;

8048,THRENOS,"At morn and even, shades are longest;"
8049,THRENOS,At noon they are or short or none:

8061,THRENOS,Wherein my Lady rideth!
8062,THRENOS,"Each that draws is a swan or a dove,"
8063,THRENOS,And well the car Love guideth.
8064,THRENOS,"As she goes, all hearts do duty"
8065,THRENOS,Unto her beauty;
8066,THRENOS,"And enamour'd do wish, so they might"
8067,THRENOS,"But enjoy such a sight,"
8068,THRENOS,"That they still were to run by her side,"

8074,THRENOS,As Love's star when it riseth!
8075,THRENOS,"Do but mark, her forehead's smoother"
8076,THRENOS,Than words that soothe her;
8077,THRENOS,And from her arch'd brows such a grace
8078,THRENOS,"Sheds itself through the face,"
8079,THRENOS,As alone there triumphs to the life
8080,THRENOS,"All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife."
8081,THRENOS,
8082,THRENOS,Have you seen but a bright lily grow
8083,THRENOS,Before rude hands have touch'd it?
8084,THRENOS,Have you mark'd but the fall of the snow
8085,THRENOS,Before the soil hath smutch'd it?
8086,THRENOS,"Have you felt the wool of beaver,"
8087,THRENOS,Or swan's down ever?
8088,THRENOS,"Or have smelt o' the bud o' the brier,"
8089,THRENOS,Or the nard in the fire?

8098,THRENOS,"THOUGH beauty be the mark of praise,"
8099,THRENOS,And yours of whom I sing be such
8100,THRENOS,"As not the world can praise too much,"
8101,THRENOS,Yet 'tis your Virtue now I raise.
8102,THRENOS,
8103,THRENOS,"A virtue, like allay so gone"
8104,THRENOS,"Throughout your form as, though that move"
8105,THRENOS,"And draw and conquer all men's love,"
8106,THRENOS,This subjects you to love of one.
8107,THRENOS,
8108,THRENOS,Wherein you triumph yet--because
8109,THRENOS,"'Tis of your flesh, and that you use"
8110,THRENOS,"The noblest freedom, not to choose"
8111,THRENOS,Against or faith or honour's laws.
8112,THRENOS,
8113,THRENOS,But who should less expect from you?
8114,THRENOS,In whom alone Love lives again:
8115,THRENOS,"By whom he is restored to men,"
8116,THRENOS,And kept and bred and brought up true.
8117,THRENOS,
8118,THRENOS,"His falling temples you have rear'd,"
8119,THRENOS,The wither'd garlands ta'en away;

8121,THRENOS,"That envy wish'd, and nature fear'd:"
8122,THRENOS,
8123,THRENOS,"And on them burn so chaste a flame,"
8124,THRENOS,"With so much loyalty's expense,"
8125,THRENOS,As Love to acquit such excellence
8126,THRENOS,Is gone himself into your name.
8127,THRENOS,
8128,THRENOS,And you are he--the deity
8129,THRENOS,To whom all lovers are design'd
8130,THRENOS,That would their better objects find;
8131,THRENOS,Among which faithful troop am I--
8132,THRENOS,
8133,THRENOS,Who as an off'ring at your shrine
8134,THRENOS,"Have sung this hymn, and here entreat"
8135,THRENOS,One spark of your diviner heat
8136,THRENOS,To light upon a love of mine.
8137,THRENOS,
8138,THRENOS,"Which if it kindle not, but scant"
8139,THRENOS,"Appear, and that to shortest view;"

8149,THRENOS,
8150,THRENOS,"FALSE world, good night! since thou hast brought"
8151,THRENOS,That hour upon my morn of age;
8152,THRENOS,"Henceforth I quit thee from my thought,"
8153,THRENOS,My part is ended on thy stage.
8154,THRENOS,
8155,THRENOS,"Yes, threaten, do. Alas! I fear"
8156,THRENOS,As little as I hope from thee:
8157,THRENOS,I know thou canst not show nor bear
8158,THRENOS,More hatred than thou hast to me.
8159,THRENOS,
8160,THRENOS,"My tender, first, and simple years"
8161,THRENOS,Thou didst abuse and then betray;
8162,THRENOS,"Since stir'd'st up jealousies and fears,"
8163,THRENOS,When all the causes were away.
8164,THRENOS,
8165,THRENOS,Then in a soil hast planted me
8166,THRENOS,Where breathe the basest of thy fools;
8167,THRENOS,"Where envious arts professed be,"
8168,THRENOS,And pride and ignorance the schools;
8169,THRENOS,
8170,THRENOS,"Where nothing is examined, weigh'd,"
8171,THRENOS,"But as 'tis rumour'd, so believed;"
8172,THRENOS,"Where every freedom is betray'd,"
8173,THRENOS,And every goodness tax'd or grieved.
8174,THRENOS,
8175,THRENOS,"But what we're born for, we must bear:"
8176,THRENOS,Our frail condition it is such
8177,THRENOS,"That what to all may happen here,"
8178,THRENOS,"If 't chance to me, I must not grutch."
8179,THRENOS,
8180,THRENOS,Else I my state should much mistake
8181,THRENOS,To harbour a divided thought
8182,THRENOS,"From all my kind--that, for my sake,"
8183,THRENOS,There should a miracle be wrought.
8184,THRENOS,
8185,THRENOS,"No, I do know that I was born"
8186,THRENOS,"To age, misfortune, sickness, grief:"
8187,THRENOS,But I will bear these with that scorn
8188,THRENOS,As shall not need thy false relief.
8189,THRENOS,
8190,THRENOS,"Nor for my peace will I go far,"
8191,THRENOS,"As wanderers do, that still do roam;"
8192,THRENOS,"But make my strengths, such as they are,"

8199,THRENOS,
8200,THRENOS,"HIGH-SPIRITED friend,"
8201,THRENOS,I send nor balms nor cor'sives to your wound:
8202,THRENOS,Your fate hath found
8203,THRENOS,A gentler and more agile hand to tend
8204,THRENOS,The cure of that which is but corporal;
8205,THRENOS,"And doubtful days, which were named critical,"
8206,THRENOS,Have made their fairest flight
8207,THRENOS,And now are out of sight.
8208,THRENOS,Yet doth some wholesome physic for the mind
8209,THRENOS,"Wrapp'd in this paper lie,"
8210,THRENOS,"Which in the taking if you misapply,"
8211,THRENOS,You are unkind.
8212,THRENOS,
8213,THRENOS,"Your covetous hand,"
8214,THRENOS,"Happy in that fair honour it hath gain'd,"
8215,THRENOS,Must now be rein'd.
8216,THRENOS,True valour doth her own renown command
8217,THRENOS,In one full action; nor have you now more
8218,THRENOS,"To do, than be a husband of that store."
8219,THRENOS,Think but how dear you bought
8220,THRENOS,This fame which you have caught:
8221,THRENOS,Such thoughts will make you more in love with truth.
8222,THRENOS,"'Tis wisdom, and that high,"

8233,THRENOS,"In a little? Reader, stay."
8234,THRENOS,Underneath this stone doth lie
8235,THRENOS,As much Beauty as could die:
8236,THRENOS,Which in life did harbour give
8237,THRENOS,To more Virtue than doth live.
8238,THRENOS,"If at all she had a fault,"
8239,THRENOS,Leave it buried in this vault.
8240,THRENOS,"One name was Elizabeth,"
8241,THRENOS,"The other, let it sleep with death:"
8242,THRENOS,"Fitter, where it died, to tell"

8250,THRENOS,Epitaphs: ii
8251,THRENOS,
8252,THRENOS,"WEEP with me, all you that read"
8253,THRENOS,This little story;
8254,THRENOS,"And know, for whom a tear you shed"
8255,THRENOS,Death's self is sorry.
8256,THRENOS,'Twas a child that so did thrive
8257,THRENOS,"In grace and feature,"
8258,THRENOS,As Heaven and Nature seem'd to strive
8259,THRENOS,Which own'd the creature.
8260,THRENOS,Years he number'd scarce thirteen
8261,THRENOS,"When Fates turn'd cruel,"
8262,THRENOS,Yet three fill'd zodiacs had he been
8263,THRENOS,The stage's jewel;
8264,THRENOS,And did act (what now we moan)
8265,THRENOS,"Old men so duly,"
8266,THRENOS,"As sooth the Parcae thought him one,"
8267,THRENOS,He play'd so truly.
8268,THRENOS,"So, by error, to his fate"
8269,THRENOS,They all consented;
8270,THRENOS,"But, viewing him since, alas, too late!"
8271,THRENOS,They have repented;
8272,THRENOS,"And have sought, to give new birth,"
8273,THRENOS,In baths to steep him;
8274,THRENOS,"But, being so much too good for earth,"
8275,THRENOS,Heaven vows to keep him.

8280,THRENOS,194. A Part of an Ode
8281,THRENOS,"to the Immortal Memory and Friendship of that noble pair,"
8282,THRENOS,Sir Lucius Cary and Sir H. Morison
8283,THRENOS,
8284,THRENOS,IT is not growing like a tree
8285,THRENOS,"In bulk, doth make man better be;"
8286,THRENOS,"Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,"
8287,THRENOS,"To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere:"
8288,THRENOS,A lily of a day
8289,THRENOS,"Is fairer far in May,"
8290,THRENOS,Although it fall and die that night;
8291,THRENOS,It was the plant and flower of light.
8292,THRENOS,In small proportions we just beauties see;
8293,THRENOS,"And in short measures, life may perfect be."
8294,THRENOS,
8295,THRENOS,"Call, noble Lucius, then for wine,"
8296,THRENOS,And let thy looks with gladness shine:
8297,THRENOS,"Accept this garland, plant it on thy head,"
8298,THRENOS,"And think--nay, know--thy Morison 's not dead."
8299,THRENOS,"He leap'd the present age,"
8300,THRENOS,Possest with holy rage
8301,THRENOS,To see that bright eternal Day
8302,THRENOS,Of which we Priests and Poets say
8303,THRENOS,Such truths as we expect for happy men;
8304,THRENOS,And there he lives with memory--and Ben
8305,THRENOS,
8306,THRENOS,"Jonson: who sung this of him, ere he went"
8307,THRENOS,"Himself to rest,"
8308,THRENOS,Or tast a part of that full joy he meant
8309,THRENOS,To have exprest
8310,THRENOS,In this bright Asterism
8311,THRENOS,Where it were friendship's schism--
8312,THRENOS,Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry--
8313,THRENOS,To separate these twy
8314,THRENOS,"Lights, the Dioscuri,"
8315,THRENOS,And keep the one half from his Harry.
8316,THRENOS,"But fate doth so alternate the design,"
8317,THRENOS,"Whilst that in Heav'n, this light on earth must shine."
8318,THRENOS,
8319,THRENOS,And shine as you exalted are!
8320,THRENOS,"Two names of friendship, but one star:"
8321,THRENOS,Of hearts the union: and those not by chance
8322,THRENOS,"Made, or indenture, or leased out to advance"
8323,THRENOS,The profits for a time.
8324,THRENOS,No pleasures vain did chime
8325,THRENOS,"Of rimes or riots at your feasts,"
8326,THRENOS,Orgies of drink or feign'd protests;
8327,THRENOS,"But simple love of greatness and of good,"
8328,THRENOS,That knits brave minds and manners more than blood.
8329,THRENOS,
8330,THRENOS,This made you first to know the Why
8331,THRENOS,"You liked, then after, to apply"
8332,THRENOS,"That liking, and approach so one the t'other"
8333,THRENOS,Till either grew a portion of the other:
8334,THRENOS,Each styled by his end
8335,THRENOS,The copy of his friend.
8336,THRENOS,You lived to be the great surnames
8337,THRENOS,And titles by which all made claims
8338,THRENOS,Unto the Virtue--nothing perfect done
8339,THRENOS,But as a CARY or a MORISON.
8340,THRENOS,
8341,THRENOS,And such the force the fair example had
8342,THRENOS,As they that saw
8343,THRENOS,"The good, and durst not practise it, were glad"
8344,THRENOS,That such a law
8345,THRENOS,"Was left yet to mankind,"
8346,THRENOS,Where they might read and find
8347,THRENOS,"FRIENDSHIP indeed was written, not in words,"
8348,THRENOS,"And with the heart, not pen,"
8349,THRENOS,"Of two so early men,"
8350,THRENOS,Whose lines her rules were and records:
8351,THRENOS,"Who, ere the first down bloomed on the chin,"
8352,THRENOS,"Had sow'd these fruits, and got the harvest in."

8358,THRENOS,
8359,THRENOS,"STAY, O sweet and do not rise!"
8360,THRENOS,The light that shines comes from thine eyes;
8361,THRENOS,"The day breaks not: it is my heart,"
8362,THRENOS,Because that you and I must part.
8363,THRENOS,Stay! or else my joys will die
8364,THRENOS,And perish in their infancy.

8370,THRENOS,
8371,THRENOS,"GO and catch a falling star,"
8372,THRENOS,"Get with child a mandrake root,"
8373,THRENOS,"Tell me where all past years are,"
8374,THRENOS,Or who cleft the Devil's foot;
8375,THRENOS,"Teach me to hear mermaids singing,"
8376,THRENOS,"Or to keep off envy's stinging,"
8377,THRENOS,And find
8378,THRENOS,What wind
8379,THRENOS,Serves to advance an honest mind.
8380,THRENOS,
8381,THRENOS,"If thou be'st born to strange sights,"
8382,THRENOS,"Things invisible to see,"
8383,THRENOS,Ride ten thousand days and nights
8384,THRENOS,Till Age snow white hairs on thee;
8385,THRENOS,"Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me"
8386,THRENOS,"All strange wonders that befell thee,"
8387,THRENOS,And swear
8388,THRENOS,No where
8389,THRENOS,Lives a woman true and fair.
8390,THRENOS,
8391,THRENOS,"If thou find'st one, let me know;"
8392,THRENOS,Such a pilgrimage were sweet.
8393,THRENOS,"Yet do not; I would not go,"
8394,THRENOS,Though at next door we might meet.
8395,THRENOS,"Though she were true when you met her,"
8396,THRENOS,"And last till you write your letter,"
8397,THRENOS,Yet she
8398,THRENOS,Will be
8399,THRENOS,"False, ere I come, to two or three."

8403,THRENOS,
8404,THRENOS,197. That Time and Absence proves
8405,THRENOS,Rather helps than hurts to loves
8406,THRENOS,
8407,THRENOS,"ABSENCE, hear thou my protestation"
8408,THRENOS,"Against thy strength,"
8409,THRENOS,Distance and length:
8410,THRENOS,"Do what thou canst for alteration,"
8411,THRENOS,For hearts of truest mettle
8412,THRENOS,Absence doth join and Time doth settle.
8413,THRENOS,
8414,THRENOS,"Who loves a mistress of such quality,"
8415,THRENOS,His mind hath found
8416,THRENOS,Affection's ground
8417,THRENOS,"Beyond time, place, and all mortality."
8418,THRENOS,To hearts that cannot vary
8419,THRENOS,"Absence is present, Time doth tarry."
8420,THRENOS,
8421,THRENOS,My senses want their outward motion
8422,THRENOS,Which now within
8423,THRENOS,"Reason doth win,"
8424,THRENOS,Redoubled by her secret notion:
8425,THRENOS,Like rich men that take pleasure
8426,THRENOS,In hiding more than handling treasure.
8427,THRENOS,
8428,THRENOS,"By Absence this good means I gain,"
8429,THRENOS,That I can catch her
8430,THRENOS,"Where none can watch her,"
8431,THRENOS,In some close corner of my brain:
8432,THRENOS,"There I embrace and kiss her,"
8433,THRENOS,And so enjoy her and none miss her.

8439,THRENOS,
8440,THRENOS,"WHERE, like a pillow on a bed,"
8441,THRENOS,"A pregnant bank swell'd up, to rest"
8442,THRENOS,"The violet's reclining head,"
8443,THRENOS,"Sat we two, one another's best."
8444,THRENOS,
8445,THRENOS,Our hands were firmly cemented
8446,THRENOS,By a fast balm which thence did spring;
8447,THRENOS,"Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread"
8448,THRENOS,Our eyes upon one double string.
8449,THRENOS,
8450,THRENOS,"So to engraft our hands, as yet"
8451,THRENOS,Was all the means to make us one;
8452,THRENOS,And pictures in our eyes to get
8453,THRENOS,Was all our propagation.
8454,THRENOS,
8455,THRENOS,As 'twixt two equal armies Fate
8456,THRENOS,"Suspends uncertain victory,"
8457,THRENOS,Our souls--which to advance their state
8458,THRENOS,Were gone out--hung 'twixt her and me.
8459,THRENOS,
8460,THRENOS,"And whilst our souls negotiate there,"
8461,THRENOS,We like sepulchral statues lay;
8462,THRENOS,"All day the same our postures were,"
8463,THRENOS,"And we said nothing, all the day."

8468,THRENOS,199. The Dream
8469,THRENOS,
8470,THRENOS,"DEAR love, for nothing less than thee"
8471,THRENOS,Would I have broke this happy dream;
8472,THRENOS,It was a theme
8473,THRENOS,"For reason, much too strong for fantasy."
8474,THRENOS,Therefore thou waked'st me wisely; yet
8475,THRENOS,"My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it."
8476,THRENOS,Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice
8477,THRENOS,To make dreams truths and fables histories;
8478,THRENOS,"Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best"
8479,THRENOS,"Not to dream all my dream, let 's act the rest."
8480,THRENOS,
8481,THRENOS,"As lightning, or a taper's light,"
8482,THRENOS,"Thine eyes, and not thy noise, waked me;"
8483,THRENOS,Yet I thought thee--
8484,THRENOS,"For thou lov'st truth--an angel, at first sight;"
8485,THRENOS,"But when I saw thou saw'st my heart,"
8486,THRENOS,"And knew'st my thoughts beyond an angel's art,"
8487,THRENOS,"When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when"
8488,THRENOS,"Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,"
8489,THRENOS,I must confess it could not choose but be
8490,THRENOS,Profane to think thee anything but thee.
8491,THRENOS,
8492,THRENOS,"Coming and staying show'd thee thee,"
8493,THRENOS,But rising makes me doubt that now
8494,THRENOS,Thou art not thou.
8495,THRENOS,That Love is weak where Fear 's as strong as he;
8496,THRENOS,'Tis not all spirit pure and brave
8497,THRENOS,"If mixture it of Fear, Shame, Honour have."
8498,THRENOS,"Perchance as torches, which must ready be,"
8499,THRENOS,"Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me."
8500,THRENOS,"Thou cam'st to kindle, go'st to come: then I"
8501,THRENOS,"Will dream that hope again, but else would die."

8506,THRENOS,200. The Funeral
8507,THRENOS,
8508,THRENOS,"WHOEVER comes to shroud me, do not harm"
8509,THRENOS,Nor question much
8510,THRENOS,That subtle wreath of hair about mine arm;
8511,THRENOS,"The mystery, the sign you must not touch,"
8512,THRENOS,"For 'tis my outward soul,"
8513,THRENOS,"Viceroy to that which, unto heav'n being gone,"
8514,THRENOS,Will leave this to control
8515,THRENOS,"And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution."
8516,THRENOS,
8517,THRENOS,For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall
8518,THRENOS,Through every part
8519,THRENOS,"Can tie those parts, and make me one of all;"
8520,THRENOS,"Those hairs, which upward grew, and strength and art"
8521,THRENOS,"Have from a better brain,"
8522,THRENOS,Can better do 't: except she meant that I
8523,THRENOS,"By this should know my pain,"
8524,THRENOS,"As prisoners then are manacled, when they're condemn'd to die."
8525,THRENOS,
8526,THRENOS,"Whate'er she meant by 't, bury it with me,"
8527,THRENOS,For since I am
8528,THRENOS,"Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry"
8529,THRENOS,If into other hands these reliques came.
8530,THRENOS,As 'twas humility
8531,THRENOS,"T' afford to it all that a soul can do,"
8532,THRENOS,So 'tis some bravery
8533,THRENOS,"That, since you would have none of me, I bury some of you."

8539,THRENOS,
8540,THRENOS,"WILT Thou forgive that sin where I begun,"
8541,THRENOS,"Which was my sin, though it were done before?"
8542,THRENOS,"Wilt Thou forgive that sin through which I run,"
8543,THRENOS,"And do run still, though still I do deplore?"
8544,THRENOS,"When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done;"
8545,THRENOS,For I have more.
8546,THRENOS,
8547,THRENOS,Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I have won
8548,THRENOS,"Others to sin, and made my sins their door?"
8549,THRENOS,Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun
8550,THRENOS,"A year or two, but wallow'd in a score?"
8551,THRENOS,"When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done;"
8552,THRENOS,For I have more.
8553,THRENOS,
8554,THRENOS,"I have a sin of fear, that when I've spun"
8555,THRENOS,"My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;"
8556,THRENOS,But swear by Thyself that at my death Thy Son
8557,THRENOS,Shall shine as He shines now and heretofore:
8558,THRENOS,"And having done that, Thou hast done;"
8559,THRENOS,I fear no more.

8565,THRENOS,
8566,THRENOS,"DEATH, be not proud, though some have called thee"
8567,THRENOS,"Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so:"
8568,THRENOS,For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
8569,THRENOS,"Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me."
8570,THRENOS,"From Rest and Sleep, which but thy picture be,"
8571,THRENOS,"Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow;"
8572,THRENOS,And soonest our best men with thee do go--
8573,THRENOS,Rest of their bones and souls' delivery!
8574,THRENOS,"Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,"
8575,THRENOS,"And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;"
8576,THRENOS,And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
8577,THRENOS,And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then?
8578,THRENOS,"One short sleep past, we wake eternally,"
8579,THRENOS,"And Death shall be no more: Death, thou shalt die!"

8585,THRENOS,
8586,THRENOS,AS it fell upon a day
8587,THRENOS,"In the merry month of May,"
8588,THRENOS,Sitting in a pleasant shade
8589,THRENOS,"Which a grove of myrtles made,"
8590,THRENOS,"Beasts did leap and birds did sing,"
8591,THRENOS,Trees did grow and plants did spring;
8592,THRENOS,Everything did banish moan
8593,THRENOS,Save the Nightingale alone:
8594,THRENOS,"She, poor bird, as all forlorn"
8595,THRENOS,"Lean'd her breast up-till a thorn,"
8596,THRENOS,"And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,"
8597,THRENOS,That to hear it was great pity.
8598,THRENOS,"Fie, fie, fie! now would she cry;"
8599,THRENOS,"Tereu, Tereu! by and by;"
8600,THRENOS,That to hear her so complain
8601,THRENOS,Scarce I could from tears refrain;
8602,THRENOS,For her griefs so lively shown
8603,THRENOS,Made me think upon mine own.
8604,THRENOS,"Ah! thought I, thou mourn'st in vain,"
8605,THRENOS,None takes pity on thy pain:
8606,THRENOS,"Senseless trees they cannot hear thee,"
8607,THRENOS,Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:
8608,THRENOS,"King Pandion he is dead,"
8609,THRENOS,All thy friends are lapp'd in lead;
8610,THRENOS,All thy fellow birds do sing
8611,THRENOS,Careless of thy sorrowing:
8612,THRENOS,"Even so, poor bird, like thee,"
8613,THRENOS,None alive will pity me.

8619,THRENOS,
8620,THRENOS,"ART thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers?"
8621,THRENOS,O sweet content!
8622,THRENOS,"Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplex'd?"
8623,THRENOS,O punishment!
8624,THRENOS,Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vex'd
8625,THRENOS,To add to golden numbers golden numbers?
8626,THRENOS,"O sweet content! O sweet, O sweet content!"
8627,THRENOS,"Work apace, apace, apace, apace;"
8628,THRENOS,Honest labour bears a lovely face;
8629,THRENOS,Then hey nonny nonny--hey nonny nonny!
8630,THRENOS,
8631,THRENOS,Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?

8633,THRENOS,"Swim'st thou in wealth, yet sink'st in thine own tears?"
8634,THRENOS,O punishment!
8635,THRENOS,"Then he that patiently want's burden bears,"
8636,THRENOS,"No burden bears, but is a king, a king!"
8637,THRENOS,"O sweet content! O sweet, O sweet content!"
8638,THRENOS,"Work apace, apace, apace, apace;"
8639,THRENOS,Honest labour bears a lovely face;

9285,THRENOS,Every thing that lives or grows:
9286,THRENOS,"Love doth make the Heav'ns to move,"
9287,THRENOS,And the Sun doth burn in love:
9288,THRENOS,"Love the strong and weak doth yoke,"

9294,THRENOS,"Not all the skill his wounds can stench,"

9299,THRENOS,"Sweet birds, for love that sing and play"

9473,THRENOS,I will ne'er the more despair;

9488,THRENOS,Where to place desire before
9489,THRENOS,So that range it might no more;
9490,THRENOS,But as he that passeth by
9491,THRENOS,"Where, in all her jollity,"
9492,THRENOS,Flora's riches in a row
9493,THRENOS,"Do in seemly order grow,"
9494,THRENOS,And a thousand flowers stand

9496,THRENOS,Out of which delightful store
9497,THRENOS,One he may take and no more;
9498,THRENOS,Long he pausing doubteth whether
9499,THRENOS,Of those fair ones he should gather.

9505,THRENOS,Which whilst that enamour'd swain
9506,THRENOS,"From the stalk intends to strain,"
9507,THRENOS,(As half-fearing to be seen)
9508,THRENOS,Prettily her leaves between
9509,THRENOS,"Peeps the Violet, pale to see"
9510,THRENOS,That her virtues slighted be;
9511,THRENOS,Which so much his liking wins
9512,THRENOS,That to seize her he begins.
9513,THRENOS,
9514,THRENOS,Yet before he stoop'd so low
9515,THRENOS,He his wanton eye did throw
9516,THRENOS,"On a stem that grew more high,"
9517,THRENOS,And the Rose did there espy.
9518,THRENOS,"Who, beside her previous scent,"
9519,THRENOS,To procure his eyes content
9520,THRENOS,"Did display her goodly breast,"
9521,THRENOS,Where he found at full exprest
9522,THRENOS,All the good that Nature showers
9523,THRENOS,On a thousand other flowers;
9524,THRENOS,"Wherewith he affected takes it,"

9528,THRENOS,
9529,THRENOS,So I wand'ring but erewhile
9530,THRENOS,"Through the garden of this Isle,"
9531,THRENOS,"Saw rich beauties, I confess,"
9532,THRENOS,And in number numberless.
9533,THRENOS,"Yea, so differing lovely too,"

9991,THRENOS,
9992,THRENOS,ASK me why I send you here
9993,THRENOS,This sweet Infanta of the year?
9994,THRENOS,Ask me why I send to you
9995,THRENOS,"This primrose, thus bepearl'd with dew?"
9996,THRENOS,I will whisper to your ears:--
9997,THRENOS,The sweets of love are mix'd with tears.
9998,THRENOS,
9999,THRENOS,Ask me why this flower does show
10000,THRENOS,"So yellow-green, and sickly too?"
10001,THRENOS,Ask me why the stalk is weak
10002,THRENOS,And bending (yet it doth not break)?
10003,THRENOS,I will answer:--These discover
10004,THRENOS,What fainting hopes are in a lover.

10010,THRENOS,
10011,THRENOS,THE Rose was sick and smiling died;
10012,THRENOS,"And, being to be sanctified,"
10013,THRENOS,About the bed there sighing stood
10014,THRENOS,The sweet and flowery sisterhood:
10015,THRENOS,"Some hung the head, while some did bring,"
10016,THRENOS,"To wash her, water from the spring;"
10017,THRENOS,"Some laid her forth, while others wept,"
10018,THRENOS,But all a solemn fast there kept:
10019,THRENOS,"The holy sisters, some among,"
10020,THRENOS,The sacred dirge and trental sung.
10021,THRENOS,"But ah! what sweet smelt everywhere,"
10022,THRENOS,As Heaven had spent all perfumes there.
10023,THRENOS,"At last, when prayers for the dead"
10024,THRENOS,"And rites were all accomplished,"
10025,THRENOS,"They, weeping, spread a lawny loom,"

10037,THRENOS,If so be you ask me where
10038,THRENOS,"They do grow, I answer: There"
10039,THRENOS,Where my Julia's lips do smile;
10040,THRENOS,"There 's the land, or cherry-isle,"
10041,THRENOS,Whose plantations fully show
10042,THRENOS,All the year where cherries grow.

10048,THRENOS,
10049,THRENOS,"YOU are a tulip seen to-day,"
10050,THRENOS,"But, dearest, of so short a stay"
10051,THRENOS,That where you grew scarce man can say.
10052,THRENOS,
10053,THRENOS,"You are a lovely July-flower,"
10054,THRENOS,Yet one rude wind or ruffling shower
10055,THRENOS,"Will force you hence, and in an hour."
10056,THRENOS,
10057,THRENOS,"You are a sparkling rose i' th' bud,"
10058,THRENOS,Yet lost ere that chaste flesh and blood
10059,THRENOS,Can show where you or grew or stood.
10060,THRENOS,
10061,THRENOS,"You are a full-spread, fair-set vine,"
10062,THRENOS,"And can with tendrils love entwine,"
10063,THRENOS,Yet dried ere you distil your wine.
10064,THRENOS,
10065,THRENOS,You are like balm enclosed well
10066,THRENOS,"In amber or some crystal shell,"
10067,THRENOS,Yet lost ere you transfuse your smell.
10068,THRENOS,
10069,THRENOS,"You are a dainty violet,"
10070,THRENOS,Yet wither'd ere you can be set
10071,THRENOS,Within the virgin's coronet.
10072,THRENOS,
10073,THRENOS,You are the queen all flowers among;
10074,THRENOS,"But die you must, fair maid, ere long,"

10081,THRENOS,
10082,THRENOS,A SWEET disorder in the dress
10083,THRENOS,Kindles in clothes a wantonness:
10084,THRENOS,A lawn about the shoulders thrown
10085,THRENOS,Into a fine distraction:
10086,THRENOS,"An erring lace, which here and there"
10087,THRENOS,Enthrals the crimson stomacher:
10088,THRENOS,"A cuff neglectful, and thereby"
10089,THRENOS,Ribbands to flow confusedly:
10090,THRENOS,"A winning wave, deserving note,"
10091,THRENOS,In the tempestuous petticoat:
10092,THRENOS,"A careless shoe-string, in whose tie"
10093,THRENOS,I see a wild civility:
10094,THRENOS,Do more bewitch me than when art
10095,THRENOS,Is too precise in every part.

10101,THRENOS,
10102,THRENOS,"WHENAS in silks my Julia goes,"
10103,THRENOS,"Then, then, methinks, how sweetly flows"
10104,THRENOS,The liquefaction of her clothes!
10105,THRENOS,

10107,THRENOS,"That brave vibration each way free,"

10114,THRENOS,
10115,THRENOS,"WHY I tie about thy wrist,"
10116,THRENOS,"Julia, this silken twist;"
10117,THRENOS,For what other reason is 't
10118,THRENOS,"But to show thee how, in part,"
10119,THRENOS,Thou my pretty captive art?
10120,THRENOS,But thy bond-slave is my heart:
10121,THRENOS,"'Tis but silk that bindeth thee,"
10122,THRENOS,Knap the thread and thou art free;
10123,THRENOS,But 'tis otherwise with me:
10124,THRENOS,"--I am bound and fast bound, so"
10125,THRENOS,That from thee I cannot go;
10126,THRENOS,"If I could, I would not so."

10132,THRENOS,
10133,THRENOS,SHUT not so soon; the dull-eyed night
10134,THRENOS,Has not as yet begun
10135,THRENOS,"To make a seizure on the light,"
10136,THRENOS,Or to seal up the sun.
10137,THRENOS,
10138,THRENOS,"No marigolds yet closed are,"
10139,THRENOS,No shadows great appear;
10140,THRENOS,Nor doth the early shepherd's star
10141,THRENOS,Shine like a spangle here.
10142,THRENOS,
10143,THRENOS,Stay but till my Julia close
10144,THRENOS,"Her life-begetting eye,"

10156,THRENOS,Whose little eyes glow
10157,THRENOS,"Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee."
10158,THRENOS,
10159,THRENOS,"No Will-o'-the-wisp mislight thee,"
10160,THRENOS,Nor snake or slow-worm bite thee;
10161,THRENOS,"But on, on thy way"
10162,THRENOS,"Not making a stay,"
10163,THRENOS,Since ghost there 's none to affright thee.
10164,THRENOS,
10165,THRENOS,Let not the dark thee cumber:
10166,THRENOS,What though the moon does slumber?
10167,THRENOS,The stars of the night
10168,THRENOS,Will lend thee their light
10169,THRENOS,Like tapers clear without number.
10170,THRENOS,
10171,THRENOS,"Then, Julia, let me woo thee,"
10172,THRENOS,"Thus, thus to come unto me;"
10173,THRENOS,And when I shall meet

10191,THRENOS,Though thou not kill
10192,THRENOS,My fever.
10193,THRENOS,
10194,THRENOS,Thou sweetly canst convert the same
10195,THRENOS,From a consuming fire
10196,THRENOS,"Into a gentle licking flame,"
10197,THRENOS,And make it thus expire.
10198,THRENOS,Then make me weep
10199,THRENOS,My pains asleep;
10200,THRENOS,And give me such reposes
10201,THRENOS,"That I, poor I,"
10202,THRENOS,May think thereby
10203,THRENOS,I live and die
10204,THRENOS,'Mongst roses.
10205,THRENOS,

10209,THRENOS,A baptim o'er the flowers.
10210,THRENOS,"Melt, melt my pains"
10211,THRENOS,With thy soft strains;
10212,THRENOS,"That, having ease me given,"
10213,THRENOS,With full delight

10215,THRENOS,And take my flight
10216,THRENOS,For Heaven.

10226,THRENOS,"All hearts your captives, yours yet free;"
10227,THRENOS,Be you not proud of that rich hair
10228,THRENOS,Which wantons with the love-sick air;
10229,THRENOS,"Whenas that ruby which you wear,"
10230,THRENOS,"Sunk from the tip of your soft ear,"

10242,THRENOS,And to retain thy own?
10243,THRENOS,
10244,THRENOS,For shame or pity now incline
10245,THRENOS,To play a loving part;
10246,THRENOS,"Either to send me kindly thine,"
10247,THRENOS,Or give me back my heart.
10248,THRENOS,
10249,THRENOS,Covet not both; but if thou dost

10462,THRENOS,Of all I've writ:
10463,THRENOS,"The grace, the glory, and the best"
10464,THRENOS,Piece of the rest.
10465,THRENOS,Thou art of what I did intend
10466,THRENOS,The all and end;
10467,THRENOS,"And what was made, was made to meet"

10471,THRENOS,"We two, as reliques left, will have"
10472,THRENOS,"Once rest, one grave:"

10474,THRENOS,Lust entering here:
10475,THRENOS,Where all desires are dead and cold
10476,THRENOS,As is the mould;
10477,THRENOS,"And all affections are forgot,"

10497,THRENOS,In this securer place we'll keep
10498,THRENOS,As lull'd asleep;
10499,THRENOS,Or for a little time we'll lie
10500,THRENOS,As robes laid by;
10501,THRENOS,"To be another day re-worn,"
10502,THRENOS,"Turn'd, but not torn:"
10503,THRENOS,"Or like old testaments engross'd,"

10554,THRENOS,When the tempter me pursu'th
10555,THRENOS,"With the sins of all my youth,"
10556,THRENOS,"And half damns me with untruth,"
10557,THRENOS,"Sweet Spirit, comfort me!"

10559,THRENOS,When the flames and hellish cries
10560,THRENOS,"Fright mine ears and fright mine eyes,"

10580,THRENOS,
10581,THRENOS,"E'en so we met; and after long pursuit,"
10582,THRENOS,E'en so we joined; we both became entire;

10617,THRENOS,
10618,THRENOS,"You do obey your months and times, but I"

10624,THRENOS,
10625,THRENOS,"O teach me to see Death and not to fear,"

10628,THRENOS,And there look fresh and spruce!

10636,THRENOS,
10637,THRENOS,"WE, that did nothing study but the way"

10640,THRENOS,"Must learn the hateful art, how to forget."

10642,THRENOS,"Beyond ourselves, nor did desire to live"
10643,THRENOS,"Beyond that wish, all these now cancel must,"
10644,THRENOS,"As if not writ in faith, but words and dust."
10645,THRENOS,"Yet witness those clear vows which lovers make,"
10646,THRENOS,Witness the chaste desires that never brake
10647,THRENOS,Into unruly heats; witness that breast
10648,THRENOS,Which in thy bosom anchor'd his whole rest--
10649,THRENOS,'Tis no default in us: I dare acquite
10650,THRENOS,"Thy maiden faith, thy purpose fair and white"
10651,THRENOS,As thy pure self. Cross planets did envy
10652,THRENOS,"Us to each other, and Heaven did untie"

10654,THRENOS,"When lovers meet, should stand opposed in wars!"
10655,THRENOS,
10656,THRENOS,"Since then some higher Destinies command,"
10657,THRENOS,"Let us not strive, nor labour to withstand"
10658,THRENOS,What is past help. The longest date of grief
10659,THRENOS,Can never yield a hope of our relief:
10660,THRENOS,"Fold back our arms; take home our fruitless loves,"
10661,THRENOS,"That must new fortunes try, like turtle-doves"
10662,THRENOS,Dislodged from their haunts. We must in tears
10663,THRENOS,Unwind a love knit up in many years.
10664,THRENOS,In this last kiss I here surrender thee
10665,THRENOS,"Back to thyself.--So, thou again art free:"
10666,THRENOS,"Thou in another, sad as that, resend"
10667,THRENOS,The truest heart that lover e'er did lend.

10676,THRENOS,"ACCEPT, thou shrine of my dead saint,"
10677,THRENOS,Instead of dirges this complaint;
10678,THRENOS,And for sweet flowers to crown thy herse
10679,THRENOS,Receive a strew of weeping verse
10680,THRENOS,"From thy grieved friend, whom thou might'st see"
10681,THRENOS,Quite melted into tears for thee.
10682,THRENOS,"Dear loss! since thy untimely fate,"
10683,THRENOS,My task hath been to meditate
10684,THRENOS,"On thee, on thee! Thou art the book,"
10685,THRENOS,"The library whereon I look,"
10686,THRENOS,"Tho' almost blind. For thee, loved clay,"
10687,THRENOS,"I languish out, not live, the day...."
10688,THRENOS,Thou hast benighted me; thy set
10689,THRENOS,"This eve of blackness did beget,"
10690,THRENOS,Who wast my day (tho' overcast
10691,THRENOS,Before thou hadst thy noontide past):
10692,THRENOS,And I remember must in tears
10693,THRENOS,Thou scarce hadst seen so many years
10694,THRENOS,As day tells hours. By thy clear sun
10695,THRENOS,My love and fortune first did run;
10696,THRENOS,But thou wilt never more appear
10697,THRENOS,"Folded within my hemisphere,"
10698,THRENOS,"Since both thy light and motion,"
10699,THRENOS,"Like a fled star, is fall'n and gone,"
10700,THRENOS,And 'twixt me and my soul's dear wish
10701,THRENOS,The earth now interposed is....
10702,THRENOS,I could allow thee for a time
10703,THRENOS,To darken me and my sad clime;
10704,THRENOS,"Were it a month, a year, or ten,"
10705,THRENOS,"I would thy exile live till then,"
10706,THRENOS,And all that space my mirth adjourn--
10707,THRENOS,"So thou wouldst promise to return,"
10708,THRENOS,And putting off thy ashy shroud
10709,THRENOS,At length disperse this sorrow's cloud.
10710,THRENOS,But woe is me! the longest date
10711,THRENOS,Too narrow is to calculate
10712,THRENOS,These empty hopes: never shall I
10713,THRENOS,Be so much blest as to descry
10714,THRENOS,"A glimpse of thee, till that day come"
10715,THRENOS,"Which shall the earth to cinders doom,"
10716,THRENOS,And a fierce fever must calcine
10717,THRENOS,"The body of this world--like thine,"
10718,THRENOS,My little world! That fit of fire
10719,THRENOS,"Once off, our bodies shall aspire"
10720,THRENOS,To our souls' bliss: then we shall rise
10721,THRENOS,And view ourselves with clearer eyes
10722,THRENOS,In that calm region where no night
10723,THRENOS,Can hide us from each other's sight.
10724,THRENOS,"Meantime thou hast her, earth: much good"
10725,THRENOS,May my harm do thee! Since it stood
10726,THRENOS,With Heaven's will I might not call
10727,THRENOS,"Her longer mine, I give thee all"
10728,THRENOS,My short-lived right and interest
10729,THRENOS,In her whom living I loved best.
10730,THRENOS,"Be kind to her, and prithee look"
10731,THRENOS,Thou write into thy Doomsday book
10732,THRENOS,Each parcel of this rarity
10733,THRENOS,"Which in thy casket shrined doth lie,"
10734,THRENOS,As thou wilt answer Him that lent--
10735,THRENOS,Not gave--thee my dear monument.
10736,THRENOS,"So close the ground, and 'bout her shade"
10737,THRENOS,Black curtains draw: my bride is laid.
10738,THRENOS,"Sleep on, my Love, in thy cold bed"
10739,THRENOS,Never to be disquieted!
10740,THRENOS,My last good-night! Thou wilt not wake
10741,THRENOS,Till I thy fate shall overtake:
10742,THRENOS,"Till age, or grief, or sickness must"
10743,THRENOS,Marry my body to that dust
10744,THRENOS,It so much loves; and fill the room
10745,THRENOS,My heart keeps empty in thy tomb.
10746,THRENOS,Stay for me there: I will not fail
10747,THRENOS,To meet thee in that hollow vale.
10748,THRENOS,And think not much of my delay:
10749,THRENOS,"I am already on the way,"
10750,THRENOS,And follow thee with all the speed
10751,THRENOS,"Desire can make, or sorrows breed."
10752,THRENOS,Each minute is a short degree
10753,THRENOS,And every hour a step towards thee....
10754,THRENOS,'Tis true--with shame and grief I yield--
10755,THRENOS,"Thou, like the van, first took'st the field;"
10756,THRENOS,And gotten hast the victory
10757,THRENOS,In thus adventuring to die
10758,THRENOS,"Before me, whose more years might crave"
10759,THRENOS,A just precedence in the grave.
10760,THRENOS,"But hark! my pulse, like a soft drum,"
10761,THRENOS,"Beats my approach, tells thee I come;"
10762,THRENOS,And slow howe'er my marches be
10763,THRENOS,I shall at last sit down by thee.
10764,THRENOS,The thought of this bids me go on
10765,THRENOS,And wait my dissolution
10766,THRENOS,With hope and comfort. Dear--forgive
10767,THRENOS,The crime--I am content to live
10768,THRENOS,"Divided, with but half a heart,"
10769,THRENOS,Till we shall meet and never part.

10822,THRENOS,Unto Thine is bent:
10823,THRENOS,I aspire
10824,THRENOS,To a full consent.
10825,THRENOS,
10826,THRENOS,Not a word or look
10827,THRENOS,"I affect to own,"
10828,THRENOS,"But by book,"
10829,THRENOS,And Thy Book alone.
10830,THRENOS,
10831,THRENOS,"Though I fail, I weep;"
10832,THRENOS,"Though I halt in pace,"
10833,THRENOS,Yet I creep
10834,THRENOS,To the throne of grace.
10835,THRENOS,
10836,THRENOS,Then let wrath remove;
10837,THRENOS,Love will do the deed;
10838,THRENOS,For with love
10839,THRENOS,Stony hearts will bleed.
10840,THRENOS,
10841,THRENOS,Love is swift of foot;
10842,THRENOS,"Love 's a man of war,"
10843,THRENOS,"And can shoot,"
10844,THRENOS,And can hit from far.
10845,THRENOS,
10846,THRENOS,Who can 'scape his bow?
10847,THRENOS,"That which wrought on Thee,"
10848,THRENOS,"Brought Thee low,"
10849,THRENOS,Needs must work on me.
10850,THRENOS,
10851,THRENOS,Throw away Thy rod;
10852,THRENOS,"Though man frailties hath,"
10853,THRENOS,Thou art God:
10854,THRENOS,Throw away Thy wrath!

10860,THRENOS,
10861,THRENOS,"Man. SWEETEST Saviour, if my soul"
10862,THRENOS,"Were but worth the having,"
10863,THRENOS,Quickly should I then control
10864,THRENOS,Any thought of waving.
10865,THRENOS,But when all my care and pains
10866,THRENOS,Cannot give the name of gains
10867,THRENOS,"To Thy wretch so full of stains,"
10868,THRENOS,What delight or hope remains?
10869,THRENOS,
10870,THRENOS,"Saviour. What, child, is the balance thine,"
10871,THRENOS,Thine the poise and measure?
10872,THRENOS,"If I say, 'Thou shalt be Mine,'"
10873,THRENOS,Finger not My treasure.
10874,THRENOS,What the gains in having thee
10875,THRENOS,"Do amount to, only He"
10876,THRENOS,Who for man was sold can see;
10877,THRENOS,That transferr'd th' accounts to Me.
10878,THRENOS,
10879,THRENOS,Man. But as I can see no merit
10880,THRENOS,"Leading to this favour,"
10881,THRENOS,So the way to fit me for it
10882,THRENOS,Is beyond my savour.
10883,THRENOS,"As the reason, then, is Thine,"
10884,THRENOS,So the way is none of mine;
10885,THRENOS,I disclaim the whole design;
10886,THRENOS,Sin disclaims and I resign.
10887,THRENOS,
10888,THRENOS,Saviour. That is all: if that I could
10889,THRENOS,Get without repining;
10890,THRENOS,"And My clay, My creature, would"
10891,THRENOS,Follow My resigning;
10892,THRENOS,That as I did freely part
10893,THRENOS,"With My glory and desert,"
10894,THRENOS,Left all joys to feel all smart----
10895,THRENOS,

10904,THRENOS,
10905,THRENOS,"WHEN God at first made Man,"
10906,THRENOS,Having a glass of blessings standing by--
10907,THRENOS,Let us (said He) pour on him all we can;
10908,THRENOS,"Let the world's riches, which dispersed lie,"
10909,THRENOS,Contract into a span.
10910,THRENOS,
10911,THRENOS,"So strength first made a way,"
10912,THRENOS,"Then beauty flow'd, then wisdom, honour, pleasure:"
10913,THRENOS,"When almost all was out, God made a stay,"
10914,THRENOS,"Perceiving that, alone of all His treasure,"
10915,THRENOS,Rest in the bottom lay.
10916,THRENOS,
10917,THRENOS,For if I should (said He)
10918,THRENOS,"Bestow this jewel also on My creature,"
10919,THRENOS,"He would adore My gifts instead of Me,"
10920,THRENOS,"And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature:"
10921,THRENOS,So both should losers be.
10922,THRENOS,
10923,THRENOS,"Yet let him keep the rest,"
10924,THRENOS,But keep them with repining restlessness;
10925,THRENOS,"Let him be rich and weary, that at least,"
10926,THRENOS,"If goodness lead him not, yet weariness"
10927,THRENOS,May toss him to My breast.

10933,THRENOS,
10934,THRENOS,"LOVE bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back,"
10935,THRENOS,Guilty of dust and sin.
10936,THRENOS,"But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack"
10937,THRENOS,"From my first entrance in,"
10938,THRENOS,"Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning"
10939,THRENOS,If I lack'd anything.
10940,THRENOS,
10941,THRENOS,"'A guest,' I answer'd, 'worthy to be here:'"
10942,THRENOS,"Love said, 'You shall be he.'"
10943,THRENOS,"'I, the unkind, ungrateful? Ah, my dear,"
10944,THRENOS,I cannot look on Thee.'
10945,THRENOS,"Love took my hand and smiling did reply,"
10946,THRENOS,'Who made the eyes but I?'
10947,THRENOS,
10948,THRENOS,"'Truth, Lord; but I have marr'd them: let my shame"
10949,THRENOS,Go where it doth deserve.'
10950,THRENOS,"'And know you not,' says Love, 'Who bore the blame?'"
10951,THRENOS,"'My dear, then I will serve.'"
10952,THRENOS,"'You must sit down,' says Love, 'and taste my meat.'"
10953,THRENOS,So I did sit and eat.

10963,THRENOS,With love of gaudy mortal things?
10964,THRENOS,
10965,THRENOS,The Sun is now i' the east: each shade
10966,THRENOS,As he doth rise
10967,THRENOS,"Is shorter made,"
10968,THRENOS,That earth may lessen to our eyes.
10969,THRENOS,
10970,THRENOS,O be not careless then and play
10971,THRENOS,Until the Star of Peace
10972,THRENOS,Hide all his beams in dark recess!

10980,THRENOS,
10981,THRENOS,THE glories of our blood and state
10982,THRENOS,"Are shadows, not substantial things;"
10983,THRENOS,There is no armour against Fate;
10984,THRENOS,Death lays his icy hand on kings:
10985,THRENOS,Sceptre and Crown
10986,THRENOS,"Must tumble down,"
10987,THRENOS,And in the dust be equal made
10988,THRENOS,With the poor crooked scythe and spade.
10989,THRENOS,
10990,THRENOS,"Some men with swords may reap the field,"
10991,THRENOS,And plant fresh laurels where they kill:
10992,THRENOS,But their strong nerves at last must yield;
10993,THRENOS,They tame but one another still:
10994,THRENOS,Early or late
10995,THRENOS,"They stoop to fate,"
10996,THRENOS,And must give up their murmuring breath
10997,THRENOS,"When they, pale captives, creep to death."
10998,THRENOS,
10999,THRENOS,"The garlands wither on your brow,"
11000,THRENOS,Then boast no more your mighty deeds!
11001,THRENOS,Upon Death's purple altar now
11002,THRENOS,See where the victor-victim bleeds.
11003,THRENOS,Your heads must come
11004,THRENOS,To the cold tomb:
11005,THRENOS,Only the actions of the just
11006,THRENOS,Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.

11013,THRENOS,"ASK me no more where Jove bestows,"
11014,THRENOS,"When June is past, the fading rose;"

11016,THRENOS,"These flowers, as in their causes, sleep."
11017,THRENOS,
11018,THRENOS,Ask me no more whither do stray
11019,THRENOS,The golden atoms of the day;
11020,THRENOS,For in pure love heaven did prepare
11021,THRENOS,Those powders to enrich your hair.
11022,THRENOS,
11023,THRENOS,Ask me no more whither doth haste
11024,THRENOS,The nightingale when May is past;
11025,THRENOS,For in your sweet dividing throat
11026,THRENOS,She winters and keeps warm her note.
11027,THRENOS,
11028,THRENOS,Ask me no more where those stars 'light
11029,THRENOS,That downwards fall in dead of night;
11030,THRENOS,"For in your eyes they sit, and there"
11031,THRENOS,Fixed become as in their sphere.
11032,THRENOS,
11033,THRENOS,Ask me no more if east or west
11034,THRENOS,The Phoenix builds her spicy nest;
11035,THRENOS,"For unto you at last she flies,"
11036,THRENOS,And in your fragrant bosom dies.

11042,THRENOS,
11043,THRENOS,IF the quick spirits in your eye
11044,THRENOS,Now languish and anon must die;
11045,THRENOS,If every sweet and every grace
11046,THRENOS,Must fly from that forsaken face;
11047,THRENOS,"Then, Celia, let us reap our joys"
11048,THRENOS,Ere Time such goodly fruit destroys.
11049,THRENOS,
11050,THRENOS,Or if that golden fleece must grow
11051,THRENOS,For ever free from aged snow;
11052,THRENOS,"If those bright suns must know no shade,"
11053,THRENOS,Nor your fresh beauties ever fade;
11054,THRENOS,"Then fear not, Celia, to bestow"
11055,THRENOS,"What, still being gather'd, still must grow."
11056,THRENOS,
11057,THRENOS,Thus either Time his sickle brings

11067,THRENOS,The full reward and glorious fate

11069,THRENOS,Then curse thine own inconstancy!
11070,THRENOS,
11071,THRENOS,A fairer hand than thine shall cure
11072,THRENOS,That heart which thy false oaths did wound;
11073,THRENOS,And to my soul a soul more pure
11074,THRENOS,"Than thine shall by Love's hand be bound,"
11075,THRENOS,And both with equal glory crown'd.
11076,THRENOS,
11077,THRENOS,"Then shalt thou weep, entreat, complain"
11078,THRENOS,"To Love, as I did once to thee;"

11096,THRENOS,"Gentle thoughts and calm desires,"

11210,THRENOS,"Soul unto soul,"
11211,THRENOS,And mingling so
11212,THRENOS,Makes them such raptures know

11248,THRENOS,"So rich with jewels hung, that Night"
11249,THRENOS,Doth like an Ethiop bride appear:
11250,THRENOS,
11251,THRENOS,My soul her wings doth spread
11252,THRENOS,"And heavenward flies,"
11253,THRENOS,Th' Almighty's mysteries to read
11254,THRENOS,In the large volumes of the skies.
11255,THRENOS,
11256,THRENOS,For the bright firmament
11257,THRENOS,Shoots forth no flame
11258,THRENOS,"So silent, but is eloquent"
11259,THRENOS,In speaking the Creator's name.
11260,THRENOS,
11261,THRENOS,No unregarded star
11262,THRENOS,Contracts its light
11263,THRENOS,"Into so small a character,"
11264,THRENOS,"Removed far from our human sight,"
11265,THRENOS,
11266,THRENOS,But if we steadfast look
11267,THRENOS,We shall discern
11268,THRENOS,"In it, as in some holy book,"
11269,THRENOS,How man may heavenly knowledge learn.
11270,THRENOS,
11271,THRENOS,It tells the conqueror
11272,THRENOS,"That far-stretch'd power,"
11273,THRENOS,"Which his proud dangers traffic for,"
11274,THRENOS,Is but the triumph of an hour:
11275,THRENOS,
11276,THRENOS,"That from the farthest North,"
11277,THRENOS,"Some nation may,"
11278,THRENOS,"Yet undiscover'd, issue forth,"
11279,THRENOS,And o'er his new-got conquest sway:
11280,THRENOS,
11281,THRENOS,Some nation yet shut in
11282,THRENOS,With hills of ice
11283,THRENOS,"May be let out to scourge his sin,"
11284,THRENOS,Till they shall equal him in vice.
11285,THRENOS,
11286,THRENOS,And then they likewise shall
11287,THRENOS,Their ruin have;
11288,THRENOS,"For as yourselves your empires fall,"
11289,THRENOS,And every kingdom hath a grave.
11290,THRENOS,
11291,THRENOS,"Thus those celestial fires,"
11292,THRENOS,"Though seeming mute,"
11293,THRENOS,The fallacy of our desires
11294,THRENOS,And all the pride of life confute:--
11295,THRENOS,
11296,THRENOS,For they have watch'd since first
11297,THRENOS,The World had birth:
11298,THRENOS,"And found sin in itself accurst,"
11299,THRENOS,And nothing permanent on Earth.

11305,THRENOS,
11306,THRENOS,"I HAVE a mistress, for perfections rare"
11307,THRENOS,"In every eye, but in my thoughts most fair."
11308,THRENOS,Like tapers on the altar shine her eyes;
11309,THRENOS,Her breath is the perfume of sacrifice;
11310,THRENOS,"And wheresoe'er my fancy would begin,"
11311,THRENOS,Still her perfection lets religion in.
11312,THRENOS,"We sit and talk, and kiss away the hours"
11313,THRENOS,As chastely as the morning dews kiss flowers:
11314,THRENOS,"I touch her, like my beads, with devout care,"
11315,THRENOS,And come unto my courtship as my prayer.

11320,THRENOS,300. An Ode to Master Anthony Stafford
11321,THRENOS,to hasten Him into the Country
11322,THRENOS,
11323,THRENOS,"COME, spur away,"
11324,THRENOS,"I have no patience for a longer stay,"
11325,THRENOS,But must go down
11326,THRENOS,And leave the chargeable noise of this great town:
11327,THRENOS,"I will the country see,"
11328,THRENOS,"Where old simplicity,"
11329,THRENOS,"Though hid in gray,"
11330,THRENOS,Doth look more gay
11331,THRENOS,Than foppery in plush and scarlet clad.
11332,THRENOS,"Farewell, you city wits, that are"
11333,THRENOS,Almost at civil war--
11334,THRENOS,"'Tis time that I grow wise, when all the world grows mad."
11335,THRENOS,
11336,THRENOS,More of my days
11337,THRENOS,I will not spend to gain an idiot's praise;
11338,THRENOS,Or to make sport
11339,THRENOS,For some slight Puisne of the Inns of Court.
11340,THRENOS,"Then, worthy Stafford, say,"
11341,THRENOS,How shall we spend the day?
11342,THRENOS,With what delights
11343,THRENOS,Shorten the nights?
11344,THRENOS,"When from this tumult we are got secure,"
11345,THRENOS,"Where mirth with all her freedom goes,"
11346,THRENOS,Yet shall no finger lose;
11347,THRENOS,"Where every word is thought, and every thought is pure?"
11348,THRENOS,
11349,THRENOS,There from the tree
11350,THRENOS,"We'll cherries pluck, and pick the strawberry;"
11351,THRENOS,And every day
11352,THRENOS,"Go see the wholesome country girls make hay,"
11353,THRENOS,Whose brown hath lovelier grace
11354,THRENOS,Than any painted face
11355,THRENOS,That I do know
11356,THRENOS,Hyde Park can show:
11357,THRENOS,Where I had rather gain a kiss than meet
11358,THRENOS,(Though some of them in greater state
11359,THRENOS,Might court my love with plate)
11360,THRENOS,"The beauties of the Cheap, and wives of Lombard Street."
11361,THRENOS,
11362,THRENOS,But think upon
11363,THRENOS,Some other pleasures: these to me are none.
11364,THRENOS,Why do I prate
11365,THRENOS,"Of women, that are things against my fate!"
11366,THRENOS,I never mean to wed
11367,THRENOS,That torture to my bed:
11368,THRENOS,My Muse is she
11369,THRENOS,My love shall be.
11370,THRENOS,Let clowns get wealth and heirs: when I am gone
11371,THRENOS,"And that great bugbear, grisly Death,"
11372,THRENOS,"Shall take this idle breath,"
11373,THRENOS,"If I a poem leave, that poem is my son."
11374,THRENOS,
11375,THRENOS,Of this no more!
11376,THRENOS,We'll rather taste the bright Pomona's store.
11377,THRENOS,No fruit shall 'scape
11378,THRENOS,"Our palates, from the damson to the grape."
11379,THRENOS,"Then, full, we'll seek a shade,"
11380,THRENOS,And hear what music 's made;
11381,THRENOS,How Philomel
11382,THRENOS,"Her tale doth tell,"
11383,THRENOS,And how the other birds do fill the quire;
11384,THRENOS,"The thrush and blackbird lend their throats,"
11385,THRENOS,Warbling melodious notes;
11386,THRENOS,We will all sports enjoy which others but desire.
11387,THRENOS,
11388,THRENOS,"Ours is the sky,"
11389,THRENOS,Where at what fowl we please our hawk shall fly:
11390,THRENOS,Nor will we spare
11391,THRENOS,To hunt the crafty fox or timorous hare;
11392,THRENOS,But let our hounds run loose
11393,THRENOS,In any ground they'll choose;
11394,THRENOS,"The buck shall fall,"
11395,THRENOS,"The stag, and all."
11396,THRENOS,"Our pleasures must from their own warrants be,"
11397,THRENOS,"For to my Muse, if not to me,"
11398,THRENOS,I'm sure all game is free:
11399,THRENOS,"Heaven, earth, are all but parts of her great royalty."
11400,THRENOS,
11401,THRENOS,And when we mean
11402,THRENOS,"To taste of Bacchus' blessings now and then,"
11403,THRENOS,And drink by stealth
11404,THRENOS,"A cup or two to noble Barkley's health,"
11405,THRENOS,I'll take my pipe and try
11406,THRENOS,The Phrygian melody;
11407,THRENOS,"Which he that hears,"
11408,THRENOS,Lets through his ears
11409,THRENOS,A madness to distemper all the brain:
11410,THRENOS,Then I another pipe will take
11411,THRENOS,"And Doric music make,"
11412,THRENOS,To civilize with graver notes our wits again.

11419,THRENOS,"THE lark now leaves his wat'ry nest,"
11420,THRENOS,And climbing shakes his dewy wings.
11421,THRENOS,"He takes this window for the East,"
11422,THRENOS,And to implore your light he sings--
11423,THRENOS,"Awake, awake! the morn will never rise"
11424,THRENOS,Till she can dress her beauty at your eyes.
11425,THRENOS,
11426,THRENOS,"The merchant bows unto the seaman's star,"
11427,THRENOS,"The ploughman from the sun his season takes,"
11428,THRENOS,But still the lover wonders what they are
11429,THRENOS,Who look for day before his mistress wakes.
11430,THRENOS,"Awake, awake! break thro' your veils of lawn!"
11431,THRENOS,"Then draw your curtains, and begin the dawn!"

11437,THRENOS,
11438,THRENOS,"Lover. YOUR beauty, ripe and calm and fresh"
11439,THRENOS,"As eastern summers are,"
11440,THRENOS,"Must now, forsaking time and flesh,"
11441,THRENOS,Add light to some small star.
11442,THRENOS,
11443,THRENOS,"Philosopher. Whilst she yet lives, were stars decay'd,"
11444,THRENOS,Their light by hers relief might find;
11445,THRENOS,But Death will lead her to a shade
11446,THRENOS,Where Love is cold and Beauty blind.
11447,THRENOS,
11448,THRENOS,"Lover. Lovers, whose priests all poets are,"
11449,THRENOS,"Think every mistress, when she dies,"
11450,THRENOS,Is changed at least into a star:
11451,THRENOS,And who dares doubt the poets wise?
11452,THRENOS,
11453,THRENOS,Philosopher. But ask not bodies doom'd to die
11454,THRENOS,To what abode they go;

11456,THRENOS,It is not safe to know.

11462,THRENOS,
11463,THRENOS,"PRAISE is devotion fit for mighty minds,"
11464,THRENOS,The diff'ring world's agreeing sacrifice;
11465,THRENOS,Where Heaven divided faiths united finds:
11466,THRENOS,But Prayer in various discord upward flies.
11467,THRENOS,
11468,THRENOS,For Prayer the ocean is where diversely
11469,THRENOS,"Men steer their course, each to a sev'ral coast;"
11470,THRENOS,Where all our interests so discordant be
11471,THRENOS,That half beg winds by which the rest are lost.
11472,THRENOS,
11473,THRENOS,"By Penitence when we ourselves forsake,"
11474,THRENOS,'Tis but in wise design on piteous Heaven;
11475,THRENOS,"In Praise we nobly give what God may take,"
11476,THRENOS,"And are, without a beggar's blush, forgiven."

11482,THRENOS,
11483,THRENOS,THAT which her slender waist confined
11484,THRENOS,Shall now my joyful temples bind;
11485,THRENOS,No monarch but would give his crown
11486,THRENOS,His arms might do what this has done.
11487,THRENOS,
11488,THRENOS,"It was my Heaven's extremest sphere,"
11489,THRENOS,The pale which held that lovely deer:
11490,THRENOS,"My joy, my grief, my hope, my love,"
11491,THRENOS,Did all within this circle move.
11492,THRENOS,
11493,THRENOS,A narrow compass! and yet there
11494,THRENOS,"Dwelt all that 's good, and all that 's fair!"
11495,THRENOS,"Give me but what this ribband bound,"
11496,THRENOS,Take all the rest the sun goes round!

11504,THRENOS,"Tell her that wastes her time and me,"
11505,THRENOS,"That now she knows,"
11506,THRENOS,"When I resemble her to thee,"
11507,THRENOS,How sweet and fair she seems to be.
11508,THRENOS,
11509,THRENOS,"Tell her that 's young,"
11510,THRENOS,"And shuns to have her graces spied,"
11511,THRENOS,That hadst thou sprung
11512,THRENOS,"In deserts where no men abide,"
11513,THRENOS,Thou must have uncommended died.
11514,THRENOS,
11515,THRENOS,Small is the worth
11516,THRENOS,Of beauty from the light retired:
11517,THRENOS,"Bid her come forth,"
11518,THRENOS,"Suffer herself to be desired,"
11519,THRENOS,And not blush so to be admired.
11520,THRENOS,
11521,THRENOS,Then die--that she
11522,THRENOS,The common fate of all things rare
11523,THRENOS,May read in thee;
11524,THRENOS,How small a part of time they share
11525,THRENOS,That are so wondrous sweet and fair!

11531,THRENOS,
11532,THRENOS,THE seas are quiet when the winds give o'er;
11533,THRENOS,So calm are we when passions are no more.
11534,THRENOS,For then we know how vain it was to boast
11535,THRENOS,"Of fleeting things, so certain to be lost."
11536,THRENOS,Clouds of affection from our younger eyes
11537,THRENOS,Conceal that emptiness which age descries.
11538,THRENOS,
11539,THRENOS,"The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,"
11540,THRENOS,Lets in new light through chinks that Time hath made:
11541,THRENOS,"Stronger by weakness, wiser men become"
11542,THRENOS,As they draw near to their eternal home.
11543,THRENOS,"Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view"

11550,THRENOS,
11551,THRENOS,"IT was the Winter wilde,"
11552,THRENOS,"While the Heav'n-born-childe,"
11553,THRENOS,All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;
11554,THRENOS,Nature in aw to him
11555,THRENOS,"Had doff't her gawdy trim,"
11556,THRENOS,With her great Master so to sympathize:
11557,THRENOS,It was no season then for her
11558,THRENOS,To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour.
11559,THRENOS,
11560,THRENOS,Only with speeches fair
11561,THRENOS,She woo's the gentle Air
11562,THRENOS,"To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow,"
11563,THRENOS,"And on her naked shame,"
11564,THRENOS,"Pollute with sinfull blame,"
11565,THRENOS,"The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw,"
11566,THRENOS,"Confounded, that her Makers eyes"
11567,THRENOS,Should look so neer upon her foul deformities.
11568,THRENOS,
11569,THRENOS,"But he her fears to cease,"
11570,THRENOS,"Sent down the meek-eyd Peace,"
11571,THRENOS,"She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding"
11572,THRENOS,Down through the turning sphear
11573,THRENOS,"His ready Harbinger,"
11574,THRENOS,"With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,"
11575,THRENOS,"And waving wide her mirtle wand,"
11576,THRENOS,She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land.
11577,THRENOS,
11578,THRENOS,"No War, or Battails sound"
11579,THRENOS,"Was heard the World around,"
11580,THRENOS,The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
11581,THRENOS,The hooked Chariot stood
11582,THRENOS,"Unstain'd with hostile blood,"
11583,THRENOS,"The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng,"
11584,THRENOS,"And Kings sate still with awfull eye,"
11585,THRENOS,As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.
11586,THRENOS,
11587,THRENOS,But peacefull was the night
11588,THRENOS,Wherin the Prince of light
11589,THRENOS,His raign of peace upon the earth began:
11590,THRENOS,"The Windes with wonder whist,"
11591,THRENOS,"Smoothly the waters kist,"
11592,THRENOS,"Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean,"
11593,THRENOS,"Who now hath quite forgot to rave,"
11594,THRENOS,While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmeed wave.
11595,THRENOS,
11596,THRENOS,The Stars with deep amaze
11597,THRENOS,"Stand fixt in stedfast gaze,"
11598,THRENOS,"Bending one way their pretious influence,"
11599,THRENOS,"And will not take their flight,"
11600,THRENOS,"For all the morning light,"
11601,THRENOS,Or Lucifer that often warn'd them thence;
11602,THRENOS,"But in their glimmering Orbs did glow,"
11603,THRENOS,"Untill their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go."
11604,THRENOS,
11605,THRENOS,And though the shady gloom
11606,THRENOS,"Had given day her room,"
11607,THRENOS,"The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed,"
11608,THRENOS,"And hid his head for shame,"
11609,THRENOS,"As his inferiour flame,"
11610,THRENOS,The new enlightn'd world no more should need;
11611,THRENOS,He saw a greater Sun appear
11612,THRENOS,"Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear."
11613,THRENOS,
11614,THRENOS,"The Shepherds on the Lawn,"
11615,THRENOS,"Or ere the point of dawn,"
11616,THRENOS,Sate simply chatting in a rustick row;
11617,THRENOS,"Full little thought they than,"
11618,THRENOS,That the mighty Pan
11619,THRENOS,Was kindly com to live with them below;
11620,THRENOS,"Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep,"
11621,THRENOS,Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep.
11622,THRENOS,
11623,THRENOS,When such musick sweet
11624,THRENOS,"Their hearts and ears did greet,"
11625,THRENOS,"As never was by mortall finger strook,"
11626,THRENOS,Divinely-warbled voice
11627,THRENOS,"Answering the stringed noise,"
11628,THRENOS,As all their souls in blisfull rapture took
11629,THRENOS,"The Air such pleasure loth to lose,"
11630,THRENOS,With thousand echo's still prolongs each heav'nly close.
11631,THRENOS,
11632,THRENOS,Nature that heard such sound
11633,THRENOS,Beneath the hollow round
11634,THRENOS,"Of Cynthia's seat, the Airy region thrilling,"
11635,THRENOS,Now was almost won
11636,THRENOS,"To think her part was don,"
11637,THRENOS,And that her raign had here its last fulfilling;
11638,THRENOS,She knew such harmony alone
11639,THRENOS,Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union.
11640,THRENOS,
11641,THRENOS,At last surrounds their sight
11642,THRENOS,"A Globe of circular light,"
11643,THRENOS,"That with long beams the shame-fac't night array'd,"
11644,THRENOS,The helmed Cherubim
11645,THRENOS,"And sworded Seraphim,"
11646,THRENOS,"Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid,"
11647,THRENOS,"Harping in loud and solemn quire,"
11648,THRENOS,With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir.
11649,THRENOS,
11650,THRENOS,Such musick (as 'tis said)
11651,THRENOS,"Before was never made,"
11652,THRENOS,"But when of old the sons of morning sung,"
11653,THRENOS,While the Creator Great
11654,THRENOS,"His constellations set,"
11655,THRENOS,"And the well-ballanc't world on hinges hung,"
11656,THRENOS,"And cast the dark foundations deep,"
11657,THRENOS,And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep.
11658,THRENOS,
11659,THRENOS,"Ring out ye Crystall sphears,"
11660,THRENOS,"Once bless our human ears,"
11661,THRENOS,(If ye have power to touch our senses so)

11665,THRENOS,And with your ninefold harmony
11666,THRENOS,Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony.

11670,THRENOS,"Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,"
11671,THRENOS,And speckl'd vanity
11672,THRENOS,"Will sicken soon and die,"
11673,THRENOS,"And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould,"

11675,THRENOS,And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.
11676,THRENOS,
11677,THRENOS,"Yea Truth, and Justice then"
11678,THRENOS,"Will down return to men,"
11679,THRENOS,"Th'enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing,"

11689,THRENOS,That on the bitter cross
11690,THRENOS,Must redeem our loss;
11691,THRENOS,So both himself and us to glorifie:
11692,THRENOS,"Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,"
11693,THRENOS,"The wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep,"

11695,THRENOS,With such a horrid clang

11698,THRENOS,The aged Earth agast
11699,THRENOS,"With terrour of that blast,"

11704,THRENOS,And then at last our bliss
11705,THRENOS,"Full and perfect is,"

11707,THRENOS,Th'old Dragon under ground
11708,THRENOS,"In straiter limits bound,"
11709,THRENOS,"Not half so far casts his usurped sway,"

11750,THRENOS,"Hath left in shadows dred,"
11751,THRENOS,"His burning Idol all of blackest hue,"
11752,THRENOS,"In vain with Cymbals ring,"

11764,THRENOS,In vain with Timbrel'd Anthems dark

11772,THRENOS,Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
11773,THRENOS,"Our Babe to shew his Godhead true,"
11774,THRENOS,Can in his swadling bands controul the damned crew.

11784,THRENOS,
11785,THRENOS,"But see the Virgin blest,"
11786,THRENOS,Hath laid her Babe to rest.
11787,THRENOS,"Time is our tedious Song should here have ending,"
11788,THRENOS,"Heav'ns youngest teemed Star,"

11807,THRENOS,"For when as each thing bad thou hast entomb'd,"
11808,THRENOS,"And last of all, thy greedy self consum'd,"

11810,THRENOS,With an individual kiss;

11844,THRENOS,May rightly answer that melodious noise;

12436,THRENOS,"Or Frost to Flowers, that their gay wardrop wear,"
12437,THRENOS,When first the White thorn blows;
12438,THRENOS,"Such, Lycidas, thy loss to Shepherds ear."
12439,THRENOS,Where were ye Nymphs when the remorseless deep
12440,THRENOS,Clos'd o're the head of your lov'd Lycidas?
12441,THRENOS,"For neither were ye playing on the steep,"
12442,THRENOS,"Where your old Bards, the famous Druids ly,"
12443,THRENOS,"Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,"
12444,THRENOS,Nor yet where Deva spreads her wisard stream:
12445,THRENOS,"Ay me, I fondly dream!"
12446,THRENOS,Had ye bin there--for what could that have don?
12447,THRENOS,"What could the Muse her self that Orpheus bore,"
12448,THRENOS,"The Muse her self, for her inchanting son"
12449,THRENOS,"Whom Universal nature did lament,"
12450,THRENOS,"When by the rout that made the hideous roar,"
12451,THRENOS,"His goary visage down the stream was sent,"
12452,THRENOS,Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore.
12453,THRENOS,Alas! what boots it with uncessant care
12454,THRENOS,"To tend the homely slighted Shepherds trade,"
12455,THRENOS,"And strictly meditate the thankles Muse,"
12456,THRENOS,"Were it not better don as others use,"
12457,THRENOS,"To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,"
12458,THRENOS,Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?
12459,THRENOS,Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
12460,THRENOS,(That last infirmity of Noble mind)
12461,THRENOS,"To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes;"
12462,THRENOS,"But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find,"
12463,THRENOS,"And think to burst out into sudden blaze,"
12464,THRENOS,"Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears,"
12465,THRENOS,"And slits the thin spun life. But not the praise,"
12466,THRENOS,"Phoebus repli'd, and touch'd my trembling ears;"
12467,THRENOS,"Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,"
12468,THRENOS,Nor in the glistering foil
12469,THRENOS,"Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies,"
12470,THRENOS,"But lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes,"
12471,THRENOS,And perfet witnes of all judging Jove;
12472,THRENOS,"As he pronounces lastly on each deed,"
12473,THRENOS,Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed.
12474,THRENOS,"O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd floud,"
12475,THRENOS,"Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocall reeds,"
12476,THRENOS,That strain I heard was of a higher mood:
12477,THRENOS,"But now my Oate proceeds,"
12478,THRENOS,And listens to the Herald of the Sea
12479,THRENOS,"That came in Neptune's plea,"
12480,THRENOS,"He ask'd the Waves, and ask'd the Fellon winds,"
12481,THRENOS,What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?
12482,THRENOS,And question'd every gust of rugged wings
12483,THRENOS,"That blows from off each beaked Promontory,"
12484,THRENOS,"They knew not of his story,"
12485,THRENOS,"And sage Hippotades their answer brings,"
12486,THRENOS,"That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd,"
12487,THRENOS,"The Ayr was calm, and on the level brine,"
12488,THRENOS,Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd.
12489,THRENOS,It was that fatall and perfidious Bark
12490,THRENOS,"Built in th'eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,"
12491,THRENOS,That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
12492,THRENOS,"Next Camus, reverend Sire, went footing slow,"
12493,THRENOS,"His Mantle hairy, and his Bonnet sedge,"
12494,THRENOS,"Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge"
12495,THRENOS,Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe.
12496,THRENOS,Ah; Who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge?
12497,THRENOS,"Last came, and last did go,"
12498,THRENOS,"The Pilot of the Galilean lake,"
12499,THRENOS,"Two massy Keyes he bore of metals twain,"
12500,THRENOS,"(The Golden opes, the Iron shuts amain)"
12501,THRENOS,"He shook his Miter'd locks, and stern bespake,"
12502,THRENOS,"How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain,"
12503,THRENOS,"Anow of such as for their bellies sake,"
12504,THRENOS,"Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold?"
12505,THRENOS,"Of other care they little reck'ning make,"
12506,THRENOS,"Then how to scramble at the shearers feast,"
12507,THRENOS,And shove away the worthy bidden guest.
12508,THRENOS,Blind mouthes! that scarce themselves know how to hold
12509,THRENOS,"A Sheep-hook, or have learn'd ought els the least"
12510,THRENOS,That to the faithfull Herdmans art belongs!
12511,THRENOS,What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
12512,THRENOS,"And when they list, their lean and flashy songs"
12513,THRENOS,"Grate on their scrannel Pipes of wretched straw,"
12514,THRENOS,"The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed,"
12515,THRENOS,"But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,"
12516,THRENOS,"Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:"
12517,THRENOS,Besides what the grim Woolf with privy paw
12518,THRENOS,"Daily devours apace, and nothing sed,"
12519,THRENOS,"But that two-handed engine at the door,"
12520,THRENOS,"Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more."
12521,THRENOS,"Return Alpheus, the dread voice is past,"
12522,THRENOS,"That shrunk thy streams; Return Sicilian Muse,"
12523,THRENOS,"And call the Vales, and bid them hither cast"
12524,THRENOS,"Their Bels, and Flourets of a thousand hues."
12525,THRENOS,"Ye valleys low where the milde whispers use,"
12526,THRENOS,"Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,"
12527,THRENOS,"On whose fresh lap the swart Star sparely looks,"
12528,THRENOS,"Throw hither all your quaint enameld eyes,"
12529,THRENOS,"That on the green terf suck the honied showres,"
12530,THRENOS,And purple all the ground with vernal flowres.
12531,THRENOS,Bring the rathe Primrose that forsaken dies.
12532,THRENOS,"The tufted Crow-toe, and pale Gessamine,"
12533,THRENOS,"The white Pink, and the Pansie freakt with jeat,"
12534,THRENOS,The glowing Violet.
12535,THRENOS,"The Musk-rose, and the well attir'd Woodbine."
12536,THRENOS,"With Cowslips wan that hang the pensive hed,"
12537,THRENOS,And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
12538,THRENOS,"Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,"
12539,THRENOS,"And Daffadillies fill their cups with tears,"
12540,THRENOS,To strew the Laureat Herse where Lycid lies.
12541,THRENOS,"For so to interpose a little ease,"
12542,THRENOS,Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.
12543,THRENOS,"Ay me! Whilst thee the shores, and sounding Seas"
12544,THRENOS,"Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurld,"
12545,THRENOS,"Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,"
12546,THRENOS,Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
12547,THRENOS,Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;
12548,THRENOS,"Or whether thou to our moist vows deny'd,"
12549,THRENOS,"Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,"
12550,THRENOS,Where the great vision of the guarded Mount
12551,THRENOS,Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold;
12552,THRENOS,"Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth."
12553,THRENOS,"And, O ye Dolphins, waft the haples youth."
12554,THRENOS,"Weep no more, woful Shepherds weep no more,"
12555,THRENOS,"For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,"
12556,THRENOS,"Sunk though he be beneath the watry floar,"
12557,THRENOS,"So sinks the day-star in the Ocean bed,"
12558,THRENOS,"And yet anon repairs his drooping head,"
12559,THRENOS,"And tricks his beams, and with new spangled Ore,"
12560,THRENOS,Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
12561,THRENOS,"So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,"
12562,THRENOS,Through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves
12563,THRENOS,"Where other groves, and other streams along,"
12564,THRENOS,"With Nectar pure his oozy Lock's he laves,"
12565,THRENOS,"And hears the unexpressive nuptiall Song,"
12566,THRENOS,In the blest Kingdoms meek of joy and love.
12567,THRENOS,"There entertain him all the Saints above,"
12568,THRENOS,"In solemn troops, and sweet Societies"
12569,THRENOS,"That sing, and singing in their glory move,"
12570,THRENOS,And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
12571,THRENOS,Now Lycidas the Shepherds weep no more;
12572,THRENOS,"Hence forth thou art the Genius of the shore,"
12573,THRENOS,"In thy large recompense, and shalt be good"
12574,THRENOS,To all that wander in that perilous flood.
12575,THRENOS,"Thus sang the uncouth Swain to th'Okes and rills,"
12576,THRENOS,"While the still morn went out with Sandals gray,"
12577,THRENOS,"He touch'd the tender stops of various Quills,"
12578,THRENOS,With eager thought warbling his Dorick lay:
12579,THRENOS,"And now the Sun had stretch'd out all the hills,"
12580,THRENOS,And now was dropt into the Western bay;
12581,THRENOS,"At last he rose, and twitch'd his Mantle blew:"

12588,THRENOS,
12589,THRENOS,WHEN I consider how my light is spent
12590,THRENOS,"E're half my days, in this dark world and wide,"
12591,THRENOS,"And that one Talent which is death to hide,"
12592,THRENOS,"Lodg'd with me useless, though my Soul more bent"
12593,THRENOS,"To serve therewith my Maker, and present"
12594,THRENOS,"My true account, least he returning chide,"
12595,THRENOS,"Doth God exact day-labour, light deny'd,"
12596,THRENOS,I fondly ask; But patience to prevent
12597,THRENOS,"That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need"
12598,THRENOS,"Either man's work or his own gifts, who best"
12599,THRENOS,"Bear his milde yoak, they serve him best, his State"
12600,THRENOS,Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed

12611,THRENOS,"Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire"
12612,THRENOS,Help wast a sullen day; what may be won
12613,THRENOS,From the hard Season gaining: time will run
12614,THRENOS,"On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire"
12615,THRENOS,The frozen earth; and cloth in fresh attire
12616,THRENOS,"The Lillie and Rose, that neither sow'd nor spun."
12617,THRENOS,"What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,"
12618,THRENOS,"Of Attick tast, with Wine, whence we may rise"
12619,THRENOS,"To hear the Lute well toucht, or artfull voice"
12620,THRENOS,Warble immortal Notes and Tuskan Ayre?

12633,THRENOS,To day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench
12634,THRENOS,"In mirth, that after no repenting drawes;"
12635,THRENOS,"Let Euclid rest and Archimedes pause,"

12637,THRENOS,"To measure life, learn thou betimes, and know"
12638,THRENOS,Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
12639,THRENOS,"For other things mild Heav'n a time ordains,"
12640,THRENOS,"And disapproves that care, though wise in show,"

12655,THRENOS,"And such, as yet once more I trust to have"
12656,THRENOS,"Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,"
12657,THRENOS,"Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:"
12658,THRENOS,"Her face was vail'd, yet to my fancied sight,"
12659,THRENOS,"Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin'd"
12660,THRENOS,"So clear, as in no face with more delight."

12680,THRENOS,Won from the void and formless infinite.
12681,THRENOS,"Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,"

12683,THRENOS,"In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight"

12685,THRENOS,With other notes then to th' Orphean Lyre
12686,THRENOS,"I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,"

12697,THRENOS,Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
12698,THRENOS,Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath

12803,THRENOS,"Be his whom she held dear,"
12804,THRENOS,Not his who loved her here.
12805,THRENOS,"The sweet Philoclea, since she died,"
12806,THRENOS,"Lies by her Pirocles his side,"
12807,THRENOS,Not by Amphialus.
12808,THRENOS,
12809,THRENOS,"Some bays, perchance, or myrtle bough"
12810,THRENOS,For difference crowns the brow
12811,THRENOS,Of those kind souls that were
12812,THRENOS,The noble martyrs here:
12813,THRENOS,And if that be the only odds
12814,THRENOS,"(As who can tell?), ye kinder gods,"
12815,THRENOS,Give me the woman here!

12821,THRENOS,
12822,THRENOS,"OUT upon it, I have loved"
12823,THRENOS,Three whole days together!
12824,THRENOS,"And am like to love three more,"
12825,THRENOS,If it prove fair weather.
12826,THRENOS,
12827,THRENOS,Time shall moult away his wings
12828,THRENOS,Ere he shall discover
12829,THRENOS,In the whole wide world again
12830,THRENOS,Such a constant lover.
12831,THRENOS,
12832,THRENOS,"But the spite on 't is, no praise"
12833,THRENOS,Is due at all to me:
12834,THRENOS,"Love with me had made no stays,"
12835,THRENOS,Had it any been but she.
12836,THRENOS,
12837,THRENOS,"Had it any been but she,"
12838,THRENOS,"And that very face,"
12839,THRENOS,There had been at least ere this
12840,THRENOS,A dozen dozen in her place.

12843,THRENOS,Sir John Suckling. 1609-1642
12844,THRENOS,
12845,THRENOS,327. Why so Pale and Wan?
12846,THRENOS,
12847,THRENOS,"WHY so pale and wan, fond lover?"
12848,THRENOS,"Prithee, why so pale?"
12849,THRENOS,"Will, when looking well can't move her,"
12850,THRENOS,Looking ill prevail?
12851,THRENOS,"Prithee, why so pale?"
12852,THRENOS,
12853,THRENOS,"Why so dull and mute, young sinner?"
12854,THRENOS,"Prithee, why so mute?"
12855,THRENOS,"Will, when speaking well can't win her,"
12856,THRENOS,Saying nothing do 't?
12857,THRENOS,"Prithee, why so mute?"
12858,THRENOS,
12859,THRENOS,"Quit, quit for shame! This will not move;"
12860,THRENOS,This cannot take her.
12861,THRENOS,"If of herself she will not love,"
12862,THRENOS,Nothing can make her:
12863,THRENOS,The devil take her!

12869,THRENOS,
12870,THRENOS,"WHEN, dearest, I but think of thee,"
12871,THRENOS,Methinks all things that lovely be
12872,THRENOS,"Are present, and my soul delighted:"
12873,THRENOS,For beauties that from worth arise
12874,THRENOS,"Are like the grace of deities,"
12875,THRENOS,"Still present with us, tho' unsighted."
12876,THRENOS,
12877,THRENOS,Thus while I sit and sigh the day
12878,THRENOS,"With all his borrow'd lights away,"
12879,THRENOS,"Till night's black wings do overtake me,"
12880,THRENOS,"Thinking on thee, thy beauties then,"
12881,THRENOS,"As sudden lights do sleepy men,"
12882,THRENOS,So they by their bright rays awake me.
12883,THRENOS,
12884,THRENOS,"Thus absence dies, and dying proves"
12885,THRENOS,No absence can subsist with loves
12886,THRENOS,That do partake of fair perfection:
12887,THRENOS,Since in the darkest night they may
12888,THRENOS,By love's quick motion find a way
12889,THRENOS,To see each other by reflection.
12890,THRENOS,
12891,THRENOS,The waving sea can with each flood
12892,THRENOS,Bathe some high promont that hath stood
12893,THRENOS,Far from the main up in the river:
12894,THRENOS,O think not then but love can do
12895,THRENOS,"As much! for that 's an ocean too,"
12896,THRENOS,"Which flows not every day, but ever!"

12902,THRENOS,
12903,THRENOS,"BLOWN in the morning, thou shalt fade ere noon."
12904,THRENOS,What boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee?
12905,THRENOS,"Thou'rt wondrous frolic, being to die so soon,"
12906,THRENOS,And passing proud a little colour makes thee.
12907,THRENOS,"If thee thy brittle beauty so deceives,"
12908,THRENOS,Know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane;
12909,THRENOS,"For the same beauty doth, in bloody leaves,"
12910,THRENOS,The sentence of thy early death contain.
12911,THRENOS,"Some clown's coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower,"
12912,THRENOS,If by the careless plough thou shalt be torn;
12913,THRENOS,And many Herods lie in wait each hour
12914,THRENOS,To murder thee as soon as thou art born--
12915,THRENOS,"Nay, force thy bud to blow--their tyrant breath"

12921,THRENOS,330. To Chloe
12922,THRENOS,Who for his sake wished herself younger
12923,THRENOS,
12924,THRENOS,THERE are two births; the one when light
12925,THRENOS,First strikes the new awaken'd sense;
12926,THRENOS,"The other when two souls unite,"
12927,THRENOS,And we must count our life from thence:
12928,THRENOS,When you loved me and I loved you
12929,THRENOS,Then both of us were born anew.
12930,THRENOS,
12931,THRENOS,Love then to us new souls did give
12932,THRENOS,And in those souls did plant new powers;
12933,THRENOS,"Since when another life we live,"
12934,THRENOS,"The breath we breathe is his, not ours:"
12935,THRENOS,"Love makes those young whom age doth chill,"
12936,THRENOS,And whom he finds young keeps young still.

12942,THRENOS,
12943,THRENOS,STILL do the stars impart their light
12944,THRENOS,To those that travel in the night;
12945,THRENOS,"Still time runs on, nor doth the hand"
12946,THRENOS,Or shadow on the dial stand;
12947,THRENOS,The streams still glide and constant are:
12948,THRENOS,Only thy mind
12949,THRENOS,"Untrue I find,"
12950,THRENOS,Which carelessly
12951,THRENOS,Neglects to be
12952,THRENOS,"Like stream or shadow, hand or star."
12953,THRENOS,
12954,THRENOS,Fool that I am! I do recall
12955,THRENOS,"My words, and swear thou'rt like them all,"
12956,THRENOS,"Thou seem'st like stars to nourish fire,"
12957,THRENOS,But O how cold is thy desire!
12958,THRENOS,And like the hand upon the brass
12959,THRENOS,Thou point'st at me
12960,THRENOS,In mockery;
12961,THRENOS,If I come nigh
12962,THRENOS,"Shade-like thou'lt fly,"
12963,THRENOS,And as the stream with murmur pass.

12971,THRENOS,The day shall have its due.
12972,THRENOS,"Twist all our victories into one bright wreath,"
12973,THRENOS,On which let honour breathe;
12974,THRENOS,Then throw it round the temples of our Queen!
12975,THRENOS,'Tis she that must preserve those glories green.
12976,THRENOS,
12977,THRENOS,When greater tempests than on sea before
12978,THRENOS,Received her on the shore;
12979,THRENOS,When she was shot at 'for the King's own good'
12980,THRENOS,By legions hired to blood;
12981,THRENOS,"How bravely did she do, how bravely bear!"
12982,THRENOS,"And show'd, though they durst rage, she durst not fear."
12983,THRENOS,
12984,THRENOS,Courage was cast about her like a dress
12985,THRENOS,Of solemn comeliness:
12986,THRENOS,A gather'd mind and an untroubled face
12987,THRENOS,Did give her dangers grace:
12988,THRENOS,"Thus, arm'd with innocence, secure they move"

12995,THRENOS,that died suddenly
12996,THRENOS,
12997,THRENOS,"SHE who to Heaven more Heaven doth annex,"
12998,THRENOS,"Whose lowest thought was above all our sex,"
12999,THRENOS,"Accounted nothing death but t' be reprieved,"
13000,THRENOS,And died as free from sickness as she lived.
13001,THRENOS,"Others are dragg'd away, or must be driven,"
13002,THRENOS,She only saw her time and stept to Heaven;
13003,THRENOS,"Where seraphims view all her glories o'er,"
13004,THRENOS,As one return'd that had been there before.
13005,THRENOS,"For while she did this lower world adorn,"
13006,THRENOS,Her body seem'd rather assumed than born;
13007,THRENOS,"So rarified, advanced, so pure and whole,"
13008,THRENOS,That body might have been another's soul;
13009,THRENOS,And equally a miracle it were

13019,THRENOS,Be govern'd by no other sway
13020,THRENOS,Than purest monarchy;
13021,THRENOS,For if confusion have a part
13022,THRENOS,"(Which virtuous souls abhor),"
13023,THRENOS,"And hold a synod in thine heart,"
13024,THRENOS,I'll never love thee more.
13025,THRENOS,
13026,THRENOS,"Like Alexander I will reign,"
13027,THRENOS,And I will reign alone;
13028,THRENOS,My thoughts did evermore disdain
13029,THRENOS,A rival on my throne.
13030,THRENOS,"He either fears his fate too much,"
13031,THRENOS,"Or his deserts are small,"
13032,THRENOS,"That dares not put it to the touch,"
13033,THRENOS,To gain or lose it all.
13034,THRENOS,
13035,THRENOS,"And in the empire of thine heart,"
13036,THRENOS,"Where I should solely be,"

13038,THRENOS,"Or dare to vie with me,"

13042,THRENOS,And never love thee more.

13044,THRENOS,"But if thou wilt prove faithful then,"
13045,THRENOS,"And constant of thy word,"
13046,THRENOS,I'll make thee glorious by my pen
13047,THRENOS,And famous by my sword;
13048,THRENOS,I'll serve thee in such noble ways
13049,THRENOS,Was never heard before;

13074,THRENOS,Your most beautiful bride who with garlands is crown'd
13075,THRENOS,"And kills with each glance as she treads on the ground,"

13224,THRENOS,"My future hopes can raise,"
13225,THRENOS,A trophy to her present praise;
13226,THRENOS,
13227,THRENOS,"Her, that dares be"
13228,THRENOS,What these lines wish to see;
13229,THRENOS,"I seek no further, it is She."
13230,THRENOS,
13231,THRENOS,"'Tis She, and here,"
13232,THRENOS,Lo! I unclothe and clear
13233,THRENOS,My Wishes' cloudy character.
13234,THRENOS,
13235,THRENOS,May she enjoy it
13236,THRENOS,"Whose merit dare apply it,"
13237,THRENOS,But modesty dares still deny it!
13238,THRENOS,
13239,THRENOS,Such worth as this is
13240,THRENOS,"Shall fix my flying Wishes,"
13241,THRENOS,And determine them to kisses.
13242,THRENOS,
13243,THRENOS,"Let her full glory,"
13244,THRENOS,"My fancies, fly before ye;"
13245,THRENOS,Be ye my fictions--but her story.

13250,THRENOS,337. The Weeper
13251,THRENOS,
13252,THRENOS,"HAIL, sister springs,"
13253,THRENOS,Parents of silver-footed rills!
13254,THRENOS,"Ever bubbling things,"
13255,THRENOS,"Thawing crystal, snowy hills!"
13256,THRENOS,"Still spending, never spent; I mean"
13257,THRENOS,"Thy fair eyes, sweet Magdalene."
13258,THRENOS,
13259,THRENOS,Heavens thy fair eyes be;
13260,THRENOS,Heavens of ever-falling stars;
13261,THRENOS,"'Tis seed-time still with thee,"
13262,THRENOS,And stars thou sow'st whose harvest dares
13263,THRENOS,Promise the earth to countershine
13264,THRENOS,Whatever makes Heaven's forehead fine.
13265,THRENOS,
13266,THRENOS,Every morn from hence
13267,THRENOS,A brisk cherub something sips
13268,THRENOS,Whose soft influence
13269,THRENOS,Adds sweetness to his sweetest lips;
13270,THRENOS,Then to his music: and his song
13271,THRENOS,Tastes of this breakfast all day long.
13272,THRENOS,
13273,THRENOS,When some new bright guest
13274,THRENOS,"Takes up among the stars a room,"
13275,THRENOS,"And Heaven will make a feast,"
13276,THRENOS,"Angels with their bottles come,"
13277,THRENOS,And draw from these full eyes of thine
13278,THRENOS,"Their Master's water, their own wine."
13279,THRENOS,
13280,THRENOS,The dew no more will weep
13281,THRENOS,The primrose's pale cheek to deck;
13282,THRENOS,The dew no more will sleep
13283,THRENOS,Nuzzled in the lily's neck:
13284,THRENOS,"Much rather would it tremble here,"
13285,THRENOS,And leave them both to be thy tear.
13286,THRENOS,
13287,THRENOS,When sorrow would be seen
13288,THRENOS,"In her brightest majesty,"
13289,THRENOS,--For she is a Queen--
13290,THRENOS,Then is she drest by none but thee:
13291,THRENOS,Then and only then she wears
13292,THRENOS,Her richest pearls--I mean thy tears.
13293,THRENOS,
13294,THRENOS,"Not in the evening's eyes,"
13295,THRENOS,When they red with weeping are
13296,THRENOS,"For the Sun that dies,"
13297,THRENOS,Sits Sorrow with a face so fair.
13298,THRENOS,Nowhere but here did ever meet
13299,THRENOS,"Sweetness so sad, sadness so sweet."
13300,THRENOS,
13301,THRENOS,Does the night arise?
13302,THRENOS,Still thy tears do fall and fall.
13303,THRENOS,Does night lose her eyes?
13304,THRENOS,Still the fountain weeps for all.
13305,THRENOS,"Let day and night do what they will,"
13306,THRENOS,"Thou hast thy task, thou weepest still."
13307,THRENOS,
13308,THRENOS,Not So long she lived
13309,THRENOS,Will thy tomb report of thee;
13310,THRENOS,But So long she grieved:
13311,THRENOS,Thus must we date thy memory.
13312,THRENOS,"Others by days, by months, by years,"
13313,THRENOS,"Measure their ages, thou by tears."
13314,THRENOS,
13315,THRENOS,"Say, ye bright brothers,"
13316,THRENOS,The fugitive sons of those fair eyes
13317,THRENOS,"Your fruitful mothers,"
13318,THRENOS,What make you here? What hopes can 'tice
13319,THRENOS,You to be born? What cause can borrow
13320,THRENOS,You from those nests of noble sorrow?
13321,THRENOS,
13322,THRENOS,Whither away so fast
13323,THRENOS,For sure the sordid earth
13324,THRENOS,"Your sweetness cannot taste,"
13325,THRENOS,Nor does the dust deserve your birth.
13326,THRENOS,"Sweet, whither haste you then? O say,"
13327,THRENOS,Why you trip so fast away?
13328,THRENOS,
13329,THRENOS,We go not to seek
13330,THRENOS,"The darlings of Aurora's bed,"
13331,THRENOS,"The rose's modest cheek,"
13332,THRENOS,Nor the violet's humble head.
13333,THRENOS,No such thing: we go to meet
13334,THRENOS,A worthier object--our Lord's feet.

13339,THRENOS,338. A Hymn to the Name and Honour
13340,THRENOS,of the Admirable Saint Teresa
13341,THRENOS,
13342,THRENOS,"LOVE, thou are absolute, sole Lord"
13343,THRENOS,"Of life and death. To prove the word,"
13344,THRENOS,We'll now appeal to none of all
13345,THRENOS,"Those thy old soldiers, great and tall,"
13346,THRENOS,"Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach down"
13347,THRENOS,With strong arms their triumphant crown:
13348,THRENOS,Such as could with lusty breath
13349,THRENOS,"Speak loud, unto the face of death,"
13350,THRENOS,Their great Lord's glorious name; to none
13351,THRENOS,Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne
13352,THRENOS,For love at large to fill. Spare blood and sweat:
13353,THRENOS,"We'll see Him take a private seat,"
13354,THRENOS,And make His mansion in the mild
13355,THRENOS,And milky soul of a soft child.
13356,THRENOS,Scarce has she learnt to lisp a name
13357,THRENOS,"Of martyr, yet she thinks it shame"
13358,THRENOS,Life should so long play with that breath
13359,THRENOS,Which spent can buy so brave a death.
13360,THRENOS,She never undertook to know
13361,THRENOS,What death with love should have to do.
13362,THRENOS,Nor has she e'er yet understood
13363,THRENOS,"Why, to show love, she should shed blood;"
13364,THRENOS,"Yet, though she cannot tell you why,"
13365,THRENOS,"She can love, and she can die."
13366,THRENOS,Scarce has she blood enough to make
13367,THRENOS,A guilty sword blush for her sake;
13368,THRENOS,Yet has a heart dares hope to prove
13369,THRENOS,How much less strong is death than love....
13370,THRENOS,
13371,THRENOS,"Since 'tis not to be had at home,"
13372,THRENOS,She'll travel for a martyrdom.
13373,THRENOS,"No home for her, confesses she,"
13374,THRENOS,But where she may a martyr be.
13375,THRENOS,"She'll to the Moors, and trade with them"
13376,THRENOS,For this unvalued diadem;
13377,THRENOS,"She offers them her dearest breath,"
13378,THRENOS,"With Christ's name in 't, in charge for death:"
13379,THRENOS,"She'll bargain with them, and will give"
13380,THRENOS,"Them God, and teach them how to live"
13381,THRENOS,"In Him; or, if they this deny,"
13382,THRENOS,For Him she'll teach them how to die.
13383,THRENOS,So shall she leave amongst them sown
13384,THRENOS,"Her Lord's blood, or at least her own."
13385,THRENOS,
13386,THRENOS,"Farewell then, all the world, adieu!"
13387,THRENOS,Teresa is no more for you.
13388,THRENOS,"Farewell all pleasures, sports, and joys,"
13389,THRENOS,Never till now esteemed toys!
13390,THRENOS,
13391,THRENOS,Farewell whatever dear may be--
13392,THRENOS,"Mother's arms, or father's knee!"
13393,THRENOS,"Farewell house, and farewell home!"
13394,THRENOS,She 's for the Moors and Martyrdom.
13395,THRENOS,
13396,THRENOS,"Sweet, not so fast; lo! thy fair spouse,"
13397,THRENOS,"Whom thou seek'st with so swift vows,"
13398,THRENOS,"Calls thee back, and bids thee come"
13399,THRENOS,T' embrace a milder martyrdom....
13400,THRENOS,
13401,THRENOS,O how oft shalt thou complain
13402,THRENOS,Of a sweet and subtle pain!
13403,THRENOS,Of intolerable joys!
13404,THRENOS,"Of a death, in which who dies"
13405,THRENOS,"Loves his death, and dies again,"
13406,THRENOS,And would for ever so be slain;
13407,THRENOS,"And lives and dies, and knows not why"
13408,THRENOS,"To live, but that he still may die!"
13409,THRENOS,How kindly will thy gentle heart
13410,THRENOS,Kiss the sweetly-killing dart!
13411,THRENOS,And close in his embraces keep
13412,THRENOS,"Those delicious wounds, that weep"
13413,THRENOS,"Balsam, to heal themselves with thus,"
13414,THRENOS,"When these thy deaths, so numerous,"
13415,THRENOS,"Shall all at once die into one,"
13416,THRENOS,And melt thy soul's sweet mansion;
13417,THRENOS,"Like a soft lump of incense, hasted"
13418,THRENOS,"By too hot a fire, and wasted"
13419,THRENOS,"Into perfuming clouds, so fast"
13420,THRENOS,Shalt thou exhale to heaven at last
13421,THRENOS,"In a resolving sigh, and then,--"
13422,THRENOS,O what? Ask not the tongues of men.
13423,THRENOS,
13424,THRENOS,"Angels cannot tell; suffice,"
13425,THRENOS,"Thyself shalt feel thine own full joys,"
13426,THRENOS,And hold them fast for ever there.
13427,THRENOS,"So soon as thou shalt first appear,"
13428,THRENOS,"The moon of maiden stars, thy white"
13429,THRENOS,"Mistress, attended by such bright"
13430,THRENOS,"Souls as thy shining self, shall come,"
13431,THRENOS,And in her first ranks make thee room;
13432,THRENOS,"Where, 'mongst her snowy family,"
13433,THRENOS,Immortal welcomes wait for thee.
13434,THRENOS,"O what delight, when she shall stand"
13435,THRENOS,"And teach thy lips heaven, with her hand,"
13436,THRENOS,On which thou now may'st to thy wishes
13437,THRENOS,Heap up thy consecrated kisses!
13438,THRENOS,"What joy shall seize thy soul, when she,"
13439,THRENOS,"Bending her blessed eyes on thee,"
13440,THRENOS,"Those second smiles of heaven, shall dart"
13441,THRENOS,Her mild rays through thy melting heart!
13442,THRENOS,
13443,THRENOS,"Angels, thy old friends, there shall greet thee,"
13444,THRENOS,Glad at their own home now to meet thee.
13445,THRENOS,"All thy good works which went before,"
13446,THRENOS,"And waited for thee at the door,"
13447,THRENOS,Shall own thee there; and all in one
13448,THRENOS,Weave a constellation
13449,THRENOS,"Of crowns, with which the King, thy spouse,"
13450,THRENOS,Shall build up thy triumphant brows.
13451,THRENOS,"All thy old woes shall now smile on thee,"
13452,THRENOS,And thy pains sit bright upon thee:
13453,THRENOS,"All thy sorrows here shall shine,"
13454,THRENOS,And thy sufferings be divine.
13455,THRENOS,"Tears shall take comfort, and turn gems,"
13456,THRENOS,And wrongs repent to diadems.
13457,THRENOS,"Even thy deaths shall live, and new"
13458,THRENOS,Dress the soul which late they slew.
13459,THRENOS,Thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars
13460,THRENOS,As keep account of the Lamb's wars.
13461,THRENOS,
13462,THRENOS,"Those rare works, where thou shalt leave writ"
13463,THRENOS,"Love's noble history, with wit"
13464,THRENOS,"Taught thee by none but Him, while here"
13465,THRENOS,"They feed our souls, shall clothe thine there."
13466,THRENOS,Each heavenly word by whose hid flame
13467,THRENOS,"Our hard hearts shall strike fire, the same"
13468,THRENOS,"Shall flourish on thy brows, and be"
13469,THRENOS,Both fire to us and flame to thee;
13470,THRENOS,Whose light shall live bright in thy face
13471,THRENOS,"By glory, in our hearts by grace."
13472,THRENOS,"Thou shalt look round about, and see"
13473,THRENOS,Thousands of crown'd souls throng to be
13474,THRENOS,"Themselves thy crown, sons of thy vows,"
13475,THRENOS,The virgin-births with which thy spouse
13476,THRENOS,"Made fruitful thy fair soul; go now,"
13477,THRENOS,And with them all about thee bow
13478,THRENOS,"To Him; put on, He'll say, put on,"
13479,THRENOS,"My rosy Love, that thy rich zone,"
13480,THRENOS,Sparkling with the sacred flames
13481,THRENOS,"Of thousand souls, whose happy names"
13482,THRENOS,Heaven keeps upon thy score: thy bright
13483,THRENOS,Life brought them first to kiss the light
13484,THRENOS,That kindled them to stars; and so
13485,THRENOS,"Thou with the Lamb, thy Lord, shalt go."
13486,THRENOS,"And, wheresoe'er He sets His white"
13487,THRENOS,"Steps, walk with Him those ways of light,"
13488,THRENOS,"Which who in death would live to see,"
13489,THRENOS,Must learn in life to die like thee.

13496,THRENOS,
13497,THRENOS,O THOU undaunted daughter of desires!
13498,THRENOS,By all thy dower of lights and fires;
13499,THRENOS,"By all the eagle in thee, all the dove;"
13500,THRENOS,By all thy lives and deaths of love;
13501,THRENOS,"By thy large draughts of intellectual day,"
13502,THRENOS,And by thy thirsts of love more large than they;
13503,THRENOS,"By all thy brim-fill'd bowls of fierce desire,"
13504,THRENOS,By thy last morning's draught of liquid fire;
13505,THRENOS,By the full kingdom of that final kiss
13506,THRENOS,"That seized thy parting soul, and seal'd thee His;"
13507,THRENOS,By all the Heav'n thou hast in Him
13508,THRENOS,(Fair sister of the seraphim!);
13509,THRENOS,By all of Him we have in thee;
13510,THRENOS,Leave nothing of myself in me.

13518,THRENOS,
13519,THRENOS,"WE saw Thee in Thy balmy nest,"
13520,THRENOS,Young dawn of our eternal day;
13521,THRENOS,"We saw Thine eyes break from the East,"
13522,THRENOS,And chase the trembling shades away:
13523,THRENOS,"We saw Thee, and we blest the sight,"
13524,THRENOS,We saw Thee by Thine own sweet light.
13525,THRENOS,
13526,THRENOS,"Poor world, said I, what wilt thou do"
13527,THRENOS,To entertain this starry stranger?
13528,THRENOS,Is this the best thou canst bestow--
13529,THRENOS,A cold and not too cleanly manger?
13530,THRENOS,"Contend, the powers of heaven and earth,"
13531,THRENOS,To fit a bed for this huge birth.
13532,THRENOS,
13533,THRENOS,"Proud world, said I, cease your contest,"
13534,THRENOS,And let the mighty babe alone;
13535,THRENOS,"The phoenix builds the phoenix' nest,"
13536,THRENOS,Love's architecture is His own.
13537,THRENOS,"The babe, whose birth embraves this morn,"
13538,THRENOS,Made His own bed ere He was born.
13539,THRENOS,
13540,THRENOS,"I saw the curl'd drops, soft and slow,"
13541,THRENOS,"Come hovering o'er the place's head,"
13542,THRENOS,"Off'ring their whitest sheets of snow,"
13543,THRENOS,To furnish the fair infant's bed.
13544,THRENOS,"Forbear, said I, be not too bold;"
13545,THRENOS,"Your fleece is white, but 'tis too cold."
13546,THRENOS,
13547,THRENOS,I saw th' obsequious seraphim
13548,THRENOS,"Their rosy fleece of fire bestow,"
13549,THRENOS,"For well they now can spare their wings,"
13550,THRENOS,Since Heaven itself lies here below.
13551,THRENOS,"Well done, said I; but are you sure"
13552,THRENOS,"Your down, so warm, will pass for pure?"
13553,THRENOS,
13554,THRENOS,"No, no, your King 's not yet to seek"
13555,THRENOS,Where to repose His royal head;
13556,THRENOS,"See, see how soon His new-bloom'd cheek"
13557,THRENOS,'Twixt mother's breasts is gone to bed!
13558,THRENOS,"Sweet choice, said we; no way but so,"

13561,THRENOS,"She sings Thy tears asleep, and dips"
13562,THRENOS,Her kisses in Thy weeping eye;
13563,THRENOS,"She spreads the red leaves of Thy lips,"
13564,THRENOS,That in their buds yet blushing lie.
13565,THRENOS,She 'gainst those mother diamonds tries
13566,THRENOS,The points of her young eagle's eyes.
13567,THRENOS,
13568,THRENOS,"Welcome--tho' not to those gay flies,"
13569,THRENOS,"Gilded i' th' beams of earthly kings,"
13570,THRENOS,Slippery souls in smiling eyes--
13571,THRENOS,"But to poor shepherds, homespun things,"
13572,THRENOS,"Whose wealth 's their flocks, whose wit 's to be"
13573,THRENOS,Well read in their simplicity.
13574,THRENOS,
13575,THRENOS,"Yet, when young April's husband show'rs"
13576,THRENOS,"Shall bless the fruitful Maia's bed,"
13577,THRENOS,"We'll bring the first-born of her flowers,"
13578,THRENOS,To kiss Thy feet and crown Thy head.
13579,THRENOS,"To Thee, dread Lamb! whose love must keep"
13580,THRENOS,The shepherds while they feed their sheep.
13581,THRENOS,
13582,THRENOS,"To Thee, meek Majesty, soft King"
13583,THRENOS,Of simple graces and sweet loves!

13598,THRENOS,
13599,THRENOS,"Thy hands to give Thou canst not lift,"
13600,THRENOS,Yet will Thy hand still giving be;

13608,THRENOS,Who died and were buried together
13609,THRENOS,
13610,THRENOS,TO these whom death again did wed
13611,THRENOS,This grave 's the second marriage-bed.
13612,THRENOS,For though the hand of Fate could force
13613,THRENOS,"'Twixt soul and body a divorce,"
13614,THRENOS,"It could not sever man and wife,"
13615,THRENOS,Because they both lived but one life.
13616,THRENOS,"Peace, good reader, do not weep;"
13617,THRENOS,"Peace, the lovers are asleep."
13618,THRENOS,"They, sweet turtles, folded lie"
13619,THRENOS,In the last knot that love could tie.
13620,THRENOS,"Let them sleep, let them sleep on,"
13621,THRENOS,"Till the stormy night be gone,"
13622,THRENOS,And the eternal morrow dawn;
13623,THRENOS,"Then the curtains will be drawn,"

13633,THRENOS,That from the nunnery
13634,THRENOS,Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
13635,THRENOS,To war and arms I fly.
13636,THRENOS,
13637,THRENOS,"True, a new mistress now I chase,"
13638,THRENOS,The first foe in the field;
13639,THRENOS,And with a stronger faith embrace
13640,THRENOS,"A sword, a horse, a shield."
13641,THRENOS,
13642,THRENOS,Yet this inconstancy is such
13643,THRENOS,As thou too shalt adore;
13644,THRENOS,"I could not love thee, Dear, so much,"
13645,THRENOS,Loved I not Honour more.

13651,THRENOS,
13652,THRENOS,IF to be absent were to be
13653,THRENOS,Away from thee;
13654,THRENOS,Or that when I am gone
13655,THRENOS,You or I were alone;
13656,THRENOS,"Then, my Lucasta, might I crave"
13657,THRENOS,Pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave.
13658,THRENOS,
13659,THRENOS,But I'll not sigh one blast or gale
13660,THRENOS,"To swell my sail,"
13661,THRENOS,Or pay a tear to 'suage
13662,THRENOS,The foaming blue god's rage;
13663,THRENOS,For whether he will let me pass
13664,THRENOS,"Or no, I'm still as happy as I was."
13665,THRENOS,
13666,THRENOS,"Though seas and land betwixt us both,"

13671,THRENOS,"Unseen, unknown; and greet as Angels greet."
13672,THRENOS,
13673,THRENOS,So then we do anticipate
13674,THRENOS,"Our after-fate,"

13691,THRENOS,
13692,THRENOS,"Each step trod out a Lover's thought,"

13708,THRENOS,
13709,THRENOS,Let it fly as unconfined
13710,THRENOS,"As its calm ravisher the wind,"
13711,THRENOS,"Who hath left his darling, th' East,"
13712,THRENOS,To wanton o'er that spicy nest.

13738,THRENOS,
13739,THRENOS,"Up with the day, the Sun thou welcom'st then,"

13797,THRENOS,"Drinks twice ten thousand rivers up,"
13798,THRENOS,So fill'd that they o'erflow the cup.
13799,THRENOS,The busy Sun (and one would guess

13801,THRENOS,"Drinks up the sea, and when he 's done,"
13802,THRENOS,The Moon and Stars drink up the Sun:
13803,THRENOS,"They drink and dance by their own light,"

13805,THRENOS,"Nothing in Nature 's sober found,"
13806,THRENOS,But an eternal health goes round.
13807,THRENOS,"Fill up the bowl, then, fill it high,"

13823,THRENOS,The heat and troubles of the day?
13824,THRENOS,In this more than kingly state
13825,THRENOS,Love himself on me shall wait.
13826,THRENOS,"Fill to me, Love! nay, fill it up!"

13866,THRENOS,352. On the Death of Mr. William Hervey
13867,THRENOS,
13868,THRENOS,IT was a dismal and a fearful night:
13869,THRENOS,"Scarce could the Morn drive on th' unwilling Light,"
13870,THRENOS,"When Sleep, Death's image, left my troubled breast"
13871,THRENOS,By something liker Death possest.
13872,THRENOS,"My eyes with tears did uncommanded flow,"
13873,THRENOS,And on my soul hung the dull weight
13874,THRENOS,Of some intolerable fate.
13875,THRENOS,What bell was that? Ah me! too much I know!
13876,THRENOS,
13877,THRENOS,"My sweet companion and my gentle peer,"
13878,THRENOS,"Why hast thou left me thus unkindly here,"
13879,THRENOS,Thy end for ever and my life to moan?
13880,THRENOS,"O, thou hast left me all alone!"
13881,THRENOS,"Thy soul and body, when death's agony"
13882,THRENOS,"Besieged around thy noble heart,"
13883,THRENOS,Did not with more reluctance part
13884,THRENOS,"Than I, my dearest Friend, do part from thee."
13885,THRENOS,
13886,THRENOS,"My dearest Friend, would I had died for thee!"
13887,THRENOS,Life and this world henceforth will tedious be:
13888,THRENOS,Nor shall I know hereafter what to do
13889,THRENOS,If once my griefs prove tedious too.
13890,THRENOS,"Silent and sad I walk about all day,"
13891,THRENOS,As sullen ghosts stalk speechless by
13892,THRENOS,Where their hid treasures lie;
13893,THRENOS,Alas! my treasure 's gone; why do I stay?
13894,THRENOS,
13895,THRENOS,"Say, for you saw us, ye immortal lights,"
13896,THRENOS,"How oft unwearied have we spent the nights,"
13897,THRENOS,"Till the Ledaean stars, so famed for love,"
13898,THRENOS,Wonder'd at us from above!
13899,THRENOS,"We spent them not in toys, in lusts, or wine;"
13900,THRENOS,"But search of deep Philosophy,"
13901,THRENOS,"Wit, Eloquence, and Poetry--"
13902,THRENOS,"Arts which I loved, for they, my Friend, were thine."
13903,THRENOS,
13904,THRENOS,"Ye fields of Cambridge, our dear Cambridge, say"
13905,THRENOS,Have ye not seen us walking every day?
13906,THRENOS,Was there a tree about which did not know
13907,THRENOS,The love betwixt us two?
13908,THRENOS,"Henceforth, ye gentle trees, for ever fade;"
13909,THRENOS,Or your sad branches thicker join
13910,THRENOS,"And into darksome shades combine,"
13911,THRENOS,Dark as the grave wherein my Friend is laid!
13912,THRENOS,
13913,THRENOS,Large was his soul: as large a soul as e'er
13914,THRENOS,Submitted to inform a body here;
13915,THRENOS,"High as the place 'twas shortly in Heaven to have,"
13916,THRENOS,But low and humble as his grave.
13917,THRENOS,"So high that all the virtues there did come,"
13918,THRENOS,As to their chiefest seat
13919,THRENOS,Conspicuous and great;
13920,THRENOS,"So low, that for me too it made a room."
13921,THRENOS,
13922,THRENOS,"Knowledge he only sought, and so soon caught"
13923,THRENOS,As if for him Knowledge had rather sought;
13924,THRENOS,Nor did more learning ever crowded lie
13925,THRENOS,In such a short mortality.
13926,THRENOS,"Whene'er the skilful youth discoursed or writ,"
13927,THRENOS,Still did the notions throng
13928,THRENOS,About his eloquent tongue;
13929,THRENOS,Nor could his ink flow faster than his wit.
13930,THRENOS,
13931,THRENOS,"His mirth was the pure spirits of various wit,"
13932,THRENOS,Yet never did his God or friends forget;
13933,THRENOS,"And when deep talk and wisdom came in view,"
13934,THRENOS,"Retired, and gave to them their due."
13935,THRENOS,"For the rich help of books he always took,"
13936,THRENOS,Though his own searching mind before
13937,THRENOS,"Was so with notions written o'er,"
13938,THRENOS,As if wise Nature had made that her book.
13939,THRENOS,
13940,THRENOS,"With as much zeal, devotion, piety,"
13941,THRENOS,"He always lived, as other saints do die."
13942,THRENOS,"Still with his soul severe account he kept,"
13943,THRENOS,Weeping all debts out ere he slept.
13944,THRENOS,"Then down in peace and innocence he lay,"
13945,THRENOS,"Like the Sun's laborious light,"
13946,THRENOS,"Which still in water sets at night,"
13947,THRENOS,Unsullied with his journey of the day.
13948,THRENOS,
13949,THRENOS,"But happy Thou, ta'en from this frantic age,"
13950,THRENOS,Where ignorance and hypocrisy does rage!
13951,THRENOS,A fitter time for Heaven no soul e'er chose--
13952,THRENOS,The place now only free from those.
13953,THRENOS,There 'mong the blest thou dost for ever shine;
13954,THRENOS,And wheresoe'er thou casts thy view
13955,THRENOS,"Upon that white and radiant crew,"
13956,THRENOS,See'st not a soul clothed with more light than thine.

13962,THRENOS,
13963,THRENOS,WELL then! I now do plainly see
13964,THRENOS,This busy world and I shall ne'er agree.
13965,THRENOS,The very honey of all earthly joy
13966,THRENOS,Does of all meats the soonest cloy;
13967,THRENOS,"And they, methinks, deserve my pity"
13968,THRENOS,"Who for it can endure the stings,"
13969,THRENOS,"The crowd and buzz and murmurings,"
13970,THRENOS,"Of this great hive, the city."
13971,THRENOS,
13972,THRENOS,"Ah, yet, ere I descend to the grave"
13973,THRENOS,May I a small house and large garden have;
13974,THRENOS,"And a few friends, and many books, both true,"
13975,THRENOS,"Both wise, and both delightful too!"
13976,THRENOS,"And since love ne'er will from me flee,"
13977,THRENOS,"A Mistress moderately fair,"
13978,THRENOS,"And good as guardian angels are,"
13979,THRENOS,Only beloved and loving me.
13980,THRENOS,
13981,THRENOS,O fountains! when in you shall I
13982,THRENOS,Myself eased of unpeaceful thoughts espy?
13983,THRENOS,"O fields! O woods! when, when shall I be made"
13984,THRENOS,Thy happy tenant of your shade?
13985,THRENOS,Here 's the spring-head of Pleasure's flood:
13986,THRENOS,"Here 's wealthy Nature's treasury,"
13987,THRENOS,Where all the riches lie that she
13988,THRENOS,Has coin'd and stamp'd for good.
13989,THRENOS,
13990,THRENOS,Pride and ambition here
13991,THRENOS,Only in far-fetch'd metaphors appear;
13992,THRENOS,"Here nought but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter,"
13993,THRENOS,And nought but Echo flatter.
13994,THRENOS,"The gods, when they descended, hither"
13995,THRENOS,From heaven did always choose their way:
13996,THRENOS,And therefore we may boldly say
13997,THRENOS,That 'tis the way too thither.
13998,THRENOS,
13999,THRENOS,Hoe happy here should I
14000,THRENOS,"And one dear She live, and embracing die!"
14001,THRENOS,"She who is all the world, and can exclude"
14002,THRENOS,In deserts solitude.
14003,THRENOS,I should have then this only fear:
14004,THRENOS,"Lest men, when they my pleasures see,"
14005,THRENOS,"Should hither throng to live like me,"
14006,THRENOS,And so make a city here.

14012,THRENOS,
14013,THRENOS,"TELL me not of a face that 's fair,"
14014,THRENOS,"Nor lip and cheek that 's red,"
14015,THRENOS,"Nor of the tresses of her hair,"
14016,THRENOS,"Nor curls in order laid,"
14017,THRENOS,Nor of a rare seraphic voice
14018,THRENOS,That like an angel sings;
14019,THRENOS,Though if I were to take my choice
14020,THRENOS,I would have all these things:
14021,THRENOS,"But if that thou wilt have me love,"
14022,THRENOS,"And it must be a she,"
14023,THRENOS,The only argument can move
14024,THRENOS,Is that she will love me.
14025,THRENOS,
14026,THRENOS,The glories of your ladies be
14027,THRENOS,"But metaphors of things,"
14028,THRENOS,And but resemble what we see
14029,THRENOS,Each common object brings.
14030,THRENOS,"Roses out-red their lips and cheeks,"
14031,THRENOS,Lilies their whiteness stain;
14032,THRENOS,What fool is he that shadows seeks
14033,THRENOS,And may the substance gain?
14034,THRENOS,"Then if thou'lt have me love a lass,"
14035,THRENOS,Let it be one that 's kind:
14036,THRENOS,Else I'm a servant to the glass
14037,THRENOS,That 's with Canary lined.

14042,THRENOS,355. An Horatian Ode
14043,THRENOS,upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland
14044,THRENOS,
14045,THRENOS,THE forward youth that would appear
14046,THRENOS,"Must now forsake his Muses dear,"
14047,THRENOS,Nor in the shadows sing
14048,THRENOS,His numbers languishing.
14049,THRENOS,
14050,THRENOS,"'Tis time to leave the books in dust,"
14051,THRENOS,"And oil the unused armour's rust,"
14052,THRENOS,Removing from the wall
14053,THRENOS,The corslet of the hall.
14054,THRENOS,
14055,THRENOS,So restless Cromwell could not cease
14056,THRENOS,"In the inglorious arts of peace,"
14057,THRENOS,But through adventurous war
14058,THRENOS,Urged his active star:
14059,THRENOS,
14060,THRENOS,"And like the three-fork'd lightning, first"
14061,THRENOS,"Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,"
14062,THRENOS,Did thorough his own side
14063,THRENOS,His fiery way divide:
14064,THRENOS,
14065,THRENOS,"For 'tis all one to courage high,"
14066,THRENOS,"The emulous, or enemy;"
14067,THRENOS,"And with such, to enclose"
14068,THRENOS,Is more than to oppose.
14069,THRENOS,
14070,THRENOS,Then burning through the air he went
14071,THRENOS,And palaces and temples rent;
14072,THRENOS,And Caesar's head at last
14073,THRENOS,Did through his laurels blast.
14074,THRENOS,
14075,THRENOS,'Tis madness to resist or blame
14076,THRENOS,The face of angry Heaven's flame;
14077,THRENOS,"And if we would speak true,"
14078,THRENOS,"Much to the man is due,"
14079,THRENOS,
14080,THRENOS,"Who, from his private gardens, where"
14081,THRENOS,He lived reserved and austere
14082,THRENOS,(As if his highest plot
14083,THRENOS,"To plant the bergamot),"
14084,THRENOS,
14085,THRENOS,Could by industrious valour climb
14086,THRENOS,"To ruin the great work of time,"
14087,THRENOS,And cast the Kingdoms old
14088,THRENOS,Into another mould;
14089,THRENOS,
14090,THRENOS,"Though Justice against Fate complain,"
14091,THRENOS,And plead the ancient rights in vain--
14092,THRENOS,But those do hold or break
14093,THRENOS,As men are strong or weak--
14094,THRENOS,
14095,THRENOS,"Nature, that hateth emptiness,"
14096,THRENOS,"Allows of penetration less,"
14097,THRENOS,And therefore must make room
14098,THRENOS,Where greater spirits come.
14099,THRENOS,
14100,THRENOS,What field of all the civil war
14101,THRENOS,Where his were not the deepest scar?
14102,THRENOS,And Hampton shows what part
14103,THRENOS,He had of wiser art;
14104,THRENOS,
14105,THRENOS,"Where, twining subtle fears with hope,"
14106,THRENOS,He wove a net of such a scope
14107,THRENOS,That Charles himself might chase
14108,THRENOS,To Caresbrooke's narrow case;
14109,THRENOS,
14110,THRENOS,That thence the Royal actor borne
14111,THRENOS,The tragic scaffold might adorn:
14112,THRENOS,While round the armed bands
14113,THRENOS,Did clap their bloody hands.
14114,THRENOS,
14115,THRENOS,He nothing common did or mean
14116,THRENOS,"Upon that memorable scene,"
14117,THRENOS,But with his keener eye
14118,THRENOS,The axe's edge did try;
14119,THRENOS,
14120,THRENOS,"Nor call'd the gods, with vulgar spite,"
14121,THRENOS,To vindicate his helpless right;
14122,THRENOS,But bow'd his comely head
14123,THRENOS,"Down, as upon a bed."
14124,THRENOS,
14125,THRENOS,This was that memorable hour
14126,THRENOS,Which first assured the forced power:
14127,THRENOS,So when they did design
14128,THRENOS,"The Capitol's first line,"
14129,THRENOS,
14130,THRENOS,"A Bleeding Head, where they begun,"
14131,THRENOS,Did fright the architects to run;
14132,THRENOS,And yet in that the State
14133,THRENOS,Foresaw its happy fate!
14134,THRENOS,
14135,THRENOS,And now the Irish are ashamed
14136,THRENOS,To see themselves in one year tamed:
14137,THRENOS,So much one man can do
14138,THRENOS,That does both act and know.
14139,THRENOS,
14140,THRENOS,"They can affirm his praises best,"
14141,THRENOS,"And have, though overcome, confest"
14142,THRENOS,"How good he is, how just"
14143,THRENOS,And fit for highest trust.
14144,THRENOS,
14145,THRENOS,"Nor yet grown stiffer with command,"
14146,THRENOS,But still in the republic's hand--
14147,THRENOS,How fit he is to sway
14148,THRENOS,That can so well obey!
14149,THRENOS,
14150,THRENOS,He to the Commons' feet presents
14151,THRENOS,"A Kingdom for his first year's rents,"
14152,THRENOS,"And, what he may, forbears"
14153,THRENOS,"His fame, to make it theirs:"
14154,THRENOS,
14155,THRENOS,And has his sword and spoils ungirt
14156,THRENOS,To lay them at the public's skirt.
14157,THRENOS,So when the falcon high
14158,THRENOS,"Falls heavy from the sky,"
14159,THRENOS,
14160,THRENOS,"She, having kill'd, no more doth search"
14161,THRENOS,But on the next green bough to perch;
14162,THRENOS,"Where, when he first does lure,"
14163,THRENOS,The falconer has her sure.
14164,THRENOS,
14165,THRENOS,What may not then our Isle presume
14166,THRENOS,While victory his crest does plume?
14167,THRENOS,"What may not others fear,"
14168,THRENOS,If thus he crowns each year?
14169,THRENOS,
14170,THRENOS,"As Caesar he, ere long, to Gaul,"
14171,THRENOS,"To Italy an Hannibal,"
14172,THRENOS,And to all States not free
14173,THRENOS,Shall climacteric be.
14174,THRENOS,
14175,THRENOS,The Pict no shelter now shall find
14176,THRENOS,"Within his particolour'd mind,"
14177,THRENOS,"But, from this valour, sad"
14178,THRENOS,Shrink underneath the plaid;
14179,THRENOS,
14180,THRENOS,"Happy, if in the tufted brake"
14181,THRENOS,"The English hunter him mistake,"
14182,THRENOS,Nor lay his hounds in near
14183,THRENOS,The Caledonian deer.
14184,THRENOS,
14185,THRENOS,"But thou, the war's and fortune's son,"
14186,THRENOS,March indefatigably on;
14187,THRENOS,"And for the last effect,"
14188,THRENOS,Still keep the sword erect:
14189,THRENOS,
14190,THRENOS,Besides the force it has to fright
14191,THRENOS,"The spirits of the shady night,"
14192,THRENOS,The same arts that did gain
14193,THRENOS,"A power, must it maintain."

14199,THRENOS,Written after the Civil Wars
14200,THRENOS,
14201,THRENOS,"SEE how the flowers, as at parade,"
14202,THRENOS,Under their colours stand display'd:
14203,THRENOS,"Each regiment in order grows,"
14204,THRENOS,"That of the tulip, pink, and rose."
14205,THRENOS,But when the vigilant patrol
14206,THRENOS,"Of stars walks round about the pole,"
14207,THRENOS,"Their leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd,"
14208,THRENOS,Seem to their staves the ensigns furl'd.
14209,THRENOS,Then in some flower's beloved hut
14210,THRENOS,"Each bee, as sentinel, is shut,"
14211,THRENOS,"And sleeps so too; but if once stirr'd,"
14212,THRENOS,"She runs you through, nor asks the word."
14213,THRENOS,"O thou, that dear and happy Isle,"
14214,THRENOS,"The garden of the world erewhile,"
14215,THRENOS,Thou Paradise of the four seas
14216,THRENOS,"Which Heaven planted us to please,"
14217,THRENOS,"But, to exclude the world, did guard"
14218,THRENOS,With wat'ry if not flaming sword;
14219,THRENOS,What luckless apple did we taste
14220,THRENOS,To make us mortal and thee waste!
14221,THRENOS,Unhappy! shall we never more
14222,THRENOS,"That sweet militia restore,"
14223,THRENOS,"When gardens only had their towers,"
14224,THRENOS,And all the garrisons were flowers;
14225,THRENOS,"When roses only arms might bear,"
14226,THRENOS,And men did rosy garlands wear?

14231,THRENOS,357. To His Coy Mistress
14232,THRENOS,
14233,THRENOS,"HAD we but world enough, and time,"
14234,THRENOS,"This coyness, Lady, were no crime"
14235,THRENOS,We would sit down and think which way
14236,THRENOS,To walk and pass our long love's day.
14237,THRENOS,Thou by the Indian Ganges' side
14238,THRENOS,Shouldst rubies find: I by the tide
14239,THRENOS,Of Humber would complain. I would
14240,THRENOS,"Love you ten years before the Flood,"
14241,THRENOS,"And you should, if you please, refuse"
14242,THRENOS,Till the conversion of the Jews.
14243,THRENOS,My vegetable love should grow
14244,THRENOS,"Vaster than empires, and more slow;"
14245,THRENOS,An hundred years should go to praise
14246,THRENOS,Thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze;
14247,THRENOS,"Two hundred to adore each breast,"
14248,THRENOS,But thirty thousand to the rest;
14249,THRENOS,"An age at least to every part,"
14250,THRENOS,And the last age should show your heart.
14251,THRENOS,"For, Lady, you deserve this state,"
14252,THRENOS,Nor would I love at lower rate.
14253,THRENOS,But at my back I always hear
14254,THRENOS,Time's winged chariot hurrying near;
14255,THRENOS,And yonder all before us lie
14256,THRENOS,Deserts of vast eternity.
14257,THRENOS,"Thy beauty shall no more be found,"
14258,THRENOS,"Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound"
14259,THRENOS,My echoing song: then worms shall try
14260,THRENOS,"That long preserved virginity,"
14261,THRENOS,"And your quaint honour turn to dust,"
14262,THRENOS,And into ashes all my lust:
14263,THRENOS,"The grave 's a fine and private place,"
14264,THRENOS,"But none, I think, do there embrace."
14265,THRENOS,"Now therefore, while the youthful hue"
14266,THRENOS,"Sits on thy skin like morning dew,"
14267,THRENOS,And while thy willing soul transpires
14268,THRENOS,"At every pore with instant fires,"
14269,THRENOS,"Now let us sport us while we may,"
14270,THRENOS,"And now, like amorous birds of prey,"
14271,THRENOS,Rather at once our time devour
14272,THRENOS,Than languish in his slow-chapt power.
14273,THRENOS,Let us roll all our strength and all
14274,THRENOS,"Our sweetness up into one ball,"
14275,THRENOS,And tear our pleasures with rough strife
14276,THRENOS,Thorough the iron gates of life:
14277,THRENOS,"Thus, though we cannot make our sun"
14278,THRENOS,"Stand still, yet we will make him run."
14279,THRENOS,
14280,THRENOS,"slow-chapt] slow-jawed, slowly devouring."

14286,THRENOS,Prospect of Flowers
14287,THRENOS,
14288,THRENOS,SEE with what simplicity
14289,THRENOS,This nymph begins her golden days!
14290,THRENOS,"In the green grass she loves to lie,"
14291,THRENOS,And there with her fair aspect tames
14292,THRENOS,"The wilder flowers, and gives them names;"
14293,THRENOS,"But only with the roses plays,"
14294,THRENOS,And them does tell
14295,THRENOS,"What colour best becomes them, and what smell."
14296,THRENOS,
14297,THRENOS,Who can foretell for what high cause
14298,THRENOS,This darling of the gods was born?
14299,THRENOS,Yet this is she whose chaster laws
14300,THRENOS,"The wanton Love shall one day fear,"
14301,THRENOS,"And, under her command severe,"
14302,THRENOS,See his bow broke and ensigns torn.
14303,THRENOS,Happy who can
14304,THRENOS,Appease this virtuous enemy of man!
14305,THRENOS,
14306,THRENOS,O then let me in time compound
14307,THRENOS,"And parley with those conquering eyes,"
14308,THRENOS,Ere they have tried their force to wound;
14309,THRENOS,Ere with their glancing wheels they drive
14310,THRENOS,"In triumph over hearts that strive,"
14311,THRENOS,And them that yield but more despise:
14312,THRENOS,"Let me be laid,"
14313,THRENOS,Where I may see the glories from some shade.
14314,THRENOS,
14315,THRENOS,"Meantime, whilst every verdant thing"
14316,THRENOS,"Itself does at thy beauty charm,"
14317,THRENOS,Reform the errors of the Spring;
14318,THRENOS,Make that the tulips may have share
14319,THRENOS,"Of sweetness, seeing they are fair,"
14320,THRENOS,And roses of their thorns disarm;
14321,THRENOS,But most procure
14322,THRENOS,That violets may a longer age endure.
14323,THRENOS,
14324,THRENOS,"But O, young beauty of the woods,"
14325,THRENOS,"Whom Nature courts with fruits and flowers,"
14326,THRENOS,"Gather the flowers, but spare the buds;"
14327,THRENOS,"Lest Flora, angry at thy crime"
14328,THRENOS,"To kill her infants in their prime,"
14329,THRENOS,Do quickly make th' example yours;
14330,THRENOS,"And ere we see,"
14331,THRENOS,Nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee.

14336,THRENOS,359. Thoughts in a Garden
14337,THRENOS,
14338,THRENOS,HOW vainly men themselves amaze
14339,THRENOS,"To win the palm, the oak, or bays,"
14340,THRENOS,And their uncessant labours see
14341,THRENOS,"Crown'd from some single herb or tree,"
14342,THRENOS,Whose short and narrow-verged shade
14343,THRENOS,Does prudently their toils upbraid;
14344,THRENOS,While all the flowers and trees do close
14345,THRENOS,To weave the garlands of repose!
14346,THRENOS,
14347,THRENOS,"Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,"
14348,THRENOS,And Innocence thy sister dear?
14349,THRENOS,"Mistaken long, I sought you then"
14350,THRENOS,In busy companies of men:
14351,THRENOS,"Your sacred plants, if here below,"
14352,THRENOS,Only among the plants will grow:
14353,THRENOS,Society is all but rude
14354,THRENOS,To this delicious solitude.
14355,THRENOS,
14356,THRENOS,No white nor red was ever seen
14357,THRENOS,So amorous as this lovely green.
14358,THRENOS,"Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,"
14359,THRENOS,Cut in these trees their mistress' name:
14360,THRENOS,"Little, alas! they know or heed"
14361,THRENOS,How far these beauties hers exceed!
14362,THRENOS,"Fair trees! wheres'e'er your barks I wound,"
14363,THRENOS,No name shall but your own be found.
14364,THRENOS,
14365,THRENOS,"When we have run our passions' heat,"
14366,THRENOS,Love hither makes his best retreat:
14367,THRENOS,"The gods, that mortal beauty chase,"
14368,THRENOS,Still in a tree did end their race;
14369,THRENOS,Apollo hunted Daphne so
14370,THRENOS,Only that she might laurel grow;
14371,THRENOS,And Pan did after Syrinx speed
14372,THRENOS,"Not as a nymph, but for a reed."
14373,THRENOS,
14374,THRENOS,What wondrous life in this I lead!
14375,THRENOS,Ripe apples drop about my head;
14376,THRENOS,The luscious clusters of the vine
14377,THRENOS,Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
14378,THRENOS,The nectarine and curious peach
14379,THRENOS,Into my hands themselves do reach;
14380,THRENOS,"Stumbling on melons, as I pass,"
14381,THRENOS,"Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass."
14382,THRENOS,
14383,THRENOS,Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less
14384,THRENOS,Withdraws into its happiness;
14385,THRENOS,"The mind, that ocean where each kind"
14386,THRENOS,Does straight its own resemblance find;
14387,THRENOS,"Yet it creates, transcending these,"
14388,THRENOS,"Far other worlds, and other seas;"
14389,THRENOS,Annihilating all that 's made
14390,THRENOS,To a green thought in a green shade.
14391,THRENOS,
14392,THRENOS,"Here at the fountain's sliding foot,"
14393,THRENOS,"Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root,"
14394,THRENOS,"Casting the body's vest aside,"
14395,THRENOS,My soul into the boughs does glide;
14396,THRENOS,"There, like a bird, it sits and sings,"
14397,THRENOS,"Then whets and combs its silver wings,"
14398,THRENOS,"And, till prepared for longer flight,"
14399,THRENOS,Waves in its plumes the various light.
14400,THRENOS,
14401,THRENOS,Such was that happy Garden-state
14402,THRENOS,While man there walk'd without a mate:
14403,THRENOS,"After a place so pure and sweet,"
14404,THRENOS,What other help could yet be meet!
14405,THRENOS,But 'twas beyond a mortal's share
14406,THRENOS,To wander solitary there:
14407,THRENOS,"Two paradises 'twere in one,"
14408,THRENOS,To live in Paradise alone.
14409,THRENOS,
14410,THRENOS,How well the skilful gard'ner drew
14411,THRENOS,Of flowers and herbs this dial new!
14412,THRENOS,"Where, from above, the milder sun"
14413,THRENOS,Does through a fragrant zodiac run:
14414,THRENOS,"And, as it works, th' industrious bee"
14415,THRENOS,Computes its time as well as we.
14416,THRENOS,How could such sweet and wholesome hours
14417,THRENOS,"Be reckon'd, but with herbs and flowers!"

14423,THRENOS,
14424,THRENOS,WHERE the remote Bermudas ride
14425,THRENOS,"In the ocean's bosom unespied,"
14426,THRENOS,From a small boat that row'd along
14427,THRENOS,The listening woods received this song:
14428,THRENOS,
14429,THRENOS,'What should we do but sing His praise
14430,THRENOS,That led us through the watery maze
14431,THRENOS,"Unto an isle so long unknown,"
14432,THRENOS,And yet far kinder than our own?
14433,THRENOS,"Where He the huge sea-monsters wracks,"
14434,THRENOS,"That lift the deep upon their backs,"
14435,THRENOS,"He lands us on a grassy stage,"
14436,THRENOS,Safe from the storms' and prelates' rage:
14437,THRENOS,He gave us this eternal Spring
14438,THRENOS,"Which here enamels everything,"
14439,THRENOS,And sends the fowls to us in care
14440,THRENOS,On daily visits through the air:
14441,THRENOS,He hangs in shades the orange bright
14442,THRENOS,"Like golden lamps in a green night,"
14443,THRENOS,And does in the pomegranates close
14444,THRENOS,Jewels more rich than Ormus shows:
14445,THRENOS,He makes the figs our mouths to meet
14446,THRENOS,And throws the melons at our feet;
14447,THRENOS,"But apples plants of such a price,"
14448,THRENOS,No tree could ever bear them twice.
14449,THRENOS,With cedars chosen by His hand
14450,THRENOS,From Lebanon He stores the land;

14452,THRENOS,Proclaim the ambergris on shore.
14453,THRENOS,He cast (of which we rather boast)
14454,THRENOS,The Gospel's pearl upon our coast;
14455,THRENOS,And in these rocks for us did frame
14456,THRENOS,A temple where to sound His name.
14457,THRENOS,"O, let our voice His praise exalt"
14458,THRENOS,"Till it arrive at Heaven's vault,"
14459,THRENOS,Which thence (perhaps) rebounding may
14460,THRENOS,Echo beyond the Mexique bay!'
14461,THRENOS,
14462,THRENOS,Thus sung they in the English boat
14463,THRENOS,A holy and a cheerful note:
14464,THRENOS,"And all the way, to guide their chime,"
14465,THRENOS,With falling oars they kept the time.

14474,THRENOS,"Courtship which, living, she declined,"
14475,THRENOS,"When dead, to offer were unkind:"
14476,THRENOS,"Nor can the truest wit, or friend,"
14477,THRENOS,"Without detracting, her commend."
14478,THRENOS,
14479,THRENOS,To say--she lived a virgin chaste
14480,THRENOS,In this age loose and all unlaced;
14481,THRENOS,"Nor was, when vice is so allowed,"
14482,THRENOS,Of virtue or ashamed or proud;
14483,THRENOS,"That her soul was on Heaven so bent,"
14484,THRENOS,No minute but it came and went;
14485,THRENOS,"That, ready her last debt to pay,"
14486,THRENOS,She summ'd her life up every day;
14487,THRENOS,"Modest as morn, as mid-day bright,"
14488,THRENOS,"Gentle as evening, cool as night:"
14489,THRENOS,--'Tis true; but all too weakly said.

14496,THRENOS,
14497,THRENOS,"HAPPY those early days, when I"
14498,THRENOS,Shin'd in my Angel-infancy!
14499,THRENOS,Before I understood this place
14500,THRENOS,"Appointed for my second race,"
14501,THRENOS,Or taught my soul to fancy aught
14502,THRENOS,But a white celestial thought:
14503,THRENOS,When yet I had not walk'd above
14504,THRENOS,"A mile or two from my first Love,"
14505,THRENOS,And looking back--at that short space--
14506,THRENOS,Could see a glimpse of His bright face:
14507,THRENOS,"When on some gilded cloud, or flow'r,"
14508,THRENOS,"My gazing soul would dwell an hour,"
14509,THRENOS,And in those weaker glories spy
14510,THRENOS,Some shadows of eternity:
14511,THRENOS,Before I taught my tongue to wound
14512,THRENOS,"My Conscience with a sinful sound,"
14513,THRENOS,Or had the black art to dispense
14514,THRENOS,"A several sin to ev'ry sense,"
14515,THRENOS,But felt through all this fleshly dress
14516,THRENOS,Bright shoots of everlastingness.
14517,THRENOS,
14518,THRENOS,"O how I long to travel back,"
14519,THRENOS,And tread again that ancient track!
14520,THRENOS,That I might once more reach that plain
14521,THRENOS,Where first I left my glorious train;
14522,THRENOS,From whence th' enlightned spirit sees
14523,THRENOS,That shady City of Palm-trees.
14524,THRENOS,But ah! my soul with too much stay
14525,THRENOS,"Is drunk, and staggers in the way!"
14526,THRENOS,"Some men a forward motion love,"
14527,THRENOS,But I by backward steps would move;
14528,THRENOS,"And when this dust falls to the urn,"
14529,THRENOS,"In that state I came, return."

14535,THRENOS,
14536,THRENOS,"MY soul, there is a country"
14537,THRENOS,"Far beyond the stars,"
14538,THRENOS,Where stands a winged sentry
14539,THRENOS,All skilful in the wars:
14540,THRENOS,"There, above noise and danger,"
14541,THRENOS,"Sweet Peace sits crown'd with smiles,"
14542,THRENOS,And One born in a manger
14543,THRENOS,Commands the beauteous files.
14544,THRENOS,"He is thy gracious Friend,"
14545,THRENOS,"And--O my soul, awake!--"
14546,THRENOS,Did in pure love descend
14547,THRENOS,To die here for thy sake.
14548,THRENOS,"If thou canst get but thither,"
14549,THRENOS,"There grows the flower of Peace,"
14550,THRENOS,"The Rose that cannot wither,"
14551,THRENOS,"Thy fortress, and thy ease."
14552,THRENOS,Leave then thy foolish ranges;
14553,THRENOS,For none can thee secure
14554,THRENOS,But One who never changes--
14555,THRENOS,"Thy God, thy life, thy cure."

14563,THRENOS,"Many bright mornings, much dew, many showers,"
14564,THRENOS,"Pass'd o'er thy head; many light hearts and wings,"
14565,THRENOS,"Which now are dead, lodg'd in thy living bowers."
14566,THRENOS,
14567,THRENOS,And still a new succession sings and flies;
14568,THRENOS,"Fresh groves grow up, and their green branches shoot"
14569,THRENOS,"Towards the old and still enduring skies,"
14570,THRENOS,While the low violet thrives at their root.
14571,THRENOS,
14572,THRENOS,But thou beneath the sad and heavy line
14573,THRENOS,"Of death, doth waste all senseless, cold, and dark;"
14574,THRENOS,"Where not so much as dreams of light may shine,"
14575,THRENOS,"Nor any thought of greenness, leaf, or bark."
14576,THRENOS,
14577,THRENOS,"And yet--as if some deep hate and dissent,"
14578,THRENOS,"Bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee,"
14579,THRENOS,Were still alive--thou dost great storms resent
14580,THRENOS,"Before they come, and know'st how near they be."
14581,THRENOS,
14582,THRENOS,"Else all at rest thou liest, and the fierce breath"
14583,THRENOS,Of tempests can no more disturb thy ease;
14584,THRENOS,But this thy strange resentment after death
14585,THRENOS,Means only those who broke--in life--thy peace.

14593,THRENOS,And I alone sit ling'ring here;
14594,THRENOS,"Their very memory is fair and bright,"
14595,THRENOS,And my sad thoughts doth clear.
14596,THRENOS,
14597,THRENOS,"It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,"
14598,THRENOS,"Like stars upon some gloomy grove,"
14599,THRENOS,Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest
14600,THRENOS,After the sun's remove.
14601,THRENOS,
14602,THRENOS,"I see them walking in an air of glory,"
14603,THRENOS,Whose light doth trample on my days:
14604,THRENOS,"My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,"
14605,THRENOS,Mere glimmering and decays.
14606,THRENOS,
14607,THRENOS,"O holy Hope! and high Humility,"
14608,THRENOS,High as the heavens above!
14609,THRENOS,"These are your walks, and you have show'd them me,"
14610,THRENOS,To kindle my cold love.
14611,THRENOS,
14612,THRENOS,"Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the Just,"
14613,THRENOS,"Shining nowhere, but in the dark;"
14614,THRENOS,"What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust,"
14615,THRENOS,Could man outlook that mark!
14616,THRENOS,
14617,THRENOS,"He that hath found some fledg'd bird's nest may know,"

14620,THRENOS,That is to him unknown.

14622,THRENOS,And yet as Angels in some brighter dreams
14623,THRENOS,"Call to the soul, when man doth sleep:"
14624,THRENOS,"So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,"
14625,THRENOS,And into glory peep.

14670,THRENOS,And there he saw a ladye bright
14671,THRENOS,Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.
14672,THRENOS,
14673,THRENOS,"Her skirt was o' the grass-green silk,"

14688,THRENOS,"'Harp and carp, Thomas,' she said;"

14701,THRENOS,Thro' weal or woe as may chance to be.'
14702,THRENOS,

14707,THRENOS,
14708,THRENOS,"O they rade on, and farther on,"

14724,THRENOS,That lies across the lily leven?
14725,THRENOS,"That is the Path of Wickedness,"

14738,THRENOS,"O they rade on, and farther on,"
14739,THRENOS,And they waded rivers abune the knee;
14740,THRENOS,"And they saw neither sun nor moon,"
14741,THRENOS,But they heard the roaring of the sea.
14742,THRENOS,
14743,THRENOS,"It was mirk, mirk night, there was nae starlight,"
14744,THRENOS,They waded thro' red blude to the knee;

14747,THRENOS,

16953,II,"Thou roll'st above us, in thy wandering race,"
16954,II,"Or, in procession fixt and regular,"
16955,II,Mov'd with the heaven's majestic pace;
16956,II,"Or, call'd to more superior bliss,"
16957,II,Thou tread'st with seraphims the vast abyss:
16958,II,"Whatever happy region is thy place,"
16959,II,Cease thy celestial song a little space;
16960,II,"Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine,"
16961,II,Since Heaven's eternal year is thine.
16962,II,"Hear, then, a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse,"
16963,II,In no ignoble verse;
16964,II,"But such as thy own voice did practise here,"
16965,II,"When thy first-fruits of Poesy were given,"
16966,II,To make thyself a welcome inmate there;
16967,II,"While yet a young probationer,"
16968,II,And candidate of heaven.
16969,II,
16970,II,"If by traduction came thy mind,"
16971,II,"Our wonder is the less, to find"
16972,II,A soul so charming from a stock so good;
16973,II,Thy father was transfus'd into thy blood:
16974,II,"So wert thou born into the tuneful strain,"
16975,II,"An early, rich, and inexhausted vein."
16976,II,But if thy pre-existing soul
16977,II,"Was form'd at first with myriads more,"
16978,II,It did through all the mighty poets roll
16979,II,"Who Greek or Latin laurels wore,"
16980,II,"And was that Sappho last, which once it was before."
16981,II,"If so, then cease thy flight, O heaven-born mind!"
16982,II,Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore:
16983,II,"Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find,"
16984,II,Than was the beauteous frame she left behind:
16985,II,"Return, to fill or mend the quire of thy celestial kind."
16986,II,
16987,II,"May we presume to say, that, at thy birth,"
16988,II,New joy was sprung in heaven as well as here on earth?
16989,II,For sure the milder planets did combine
16990,II,"On thy auspicious horoscope to shine,"
16991,II,And even the most malicious were in trine.
16992,II,Thy brother-angels at thy birth
16993,II,"Strung each his lyre, and tun'd it high,"
16994,II,That all the people of the sky
16995,II,Might know a poetess was born on earth;
16996,II,"And then, if ever, mortal ears"
16997,II,Had heard the music of the spheres.
16998,II,And if no clust'ring swarm of bees
16999,II,"On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew,"
17000,II,'Twas that such vulgar miracles
17001,II,Heaven had not leisure to renew:
17002,II,For all the blest fraternity of love
17003,II,"Solemniz'd there thy birth, and kept thy holiday above."
17004,II,
17005,II,O gracious God! how far have we
17006,II,Profan'd thy heavenly gift of Poesy!
17007,II,"Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,"
17008,II,"Debas'd to each obscene and impious use,"
17009,II,"Whose harmony was first ordain'd above,"
17010,II,For tongues of angels and for hymns of love!
17011,II,O wretched we! why were we hurried down
17012,II,This lubrique and adulterate age
17013,II,"(Nay, added fat pollutions of our own),"
17014,II,To increase the streaming ordures of the stage?
17015,II,What can we say to excuse our second fall?
17016,II,"Let this thy Vestal, Heaven, atone for all!"
17017,II,"Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,"
17018,II,"Unmixt with foreign filth, and undefil'd;"
17019,II,"Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child."
17020,II,
17021,II,"Art she had none, yet wanted none,"
17022,II,For Nature did that want supply:
17023,II,"So rich in treasures of her own,"
17024,II,She might our boasted stores defy:
17025,II,"Such noble vigour did her verse adorn,"
17026,II,"That it seem'd borrow'd, where 'twas only born."
17027,II,"Her morals, too, were in her bosom bred,"
17028,II,"By great examples daily fed,"
17029,II,"What in the best of books, her father's life, she read."
17030,II,And to be read herself she need not fear;
17031,II,"Each test, and every light, her Muse will bear,"
17032,II,Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
17033,II,Even love (for love sometimes her Muse exprest)
17034,II,"Was but a lambent flame which play'd about her breast,"
17035,II,Light as the vapours of a morning dream;
17036,II,"So cold herself, whilst she such warmth exprest,"
17037,II,'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream....
17038,II,
17039,II,"Now all those charms, that blooming grace,"
17040,II,"The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face,"
17041,II,Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes;
17042,II,In earth the much-lamented virgin lies.
17043,II,"Not wit, nor piety could fate prevent;"
17044,II,Nor was the cruel destiny content
17045,II,"To finish all the murder at a blow,"
17046,II,To sweep at once her life and beauty too;
17047,II,"But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride"
17048,II,"To work more mischievously slow,"
17049,II,"And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd."
17050,II,"O double sacrilege on things divine,"
17051,II,"To rob the relic, and deface the shrine!"
17052,II,But thus Orinda died:
17053,II,"Heaven, by the same disease, did both translate;"
17054,II,"As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate."
17055,II,
17056,II,"Meantime, her warlike brother on the seas"
17057,II,"His waving streamers to the winds displays,"
17058,II,"And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays."
17059,II,"Ah, generous youth! that wish forbear,"
17060,II,The winds too soon will waft thee here!
17061,II,"Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,"
17062,II,"Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at home!"
17063,II,"No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,"
17064,II,Thou hast already had her last embrace.
17065,II,"But look aloft, and if thou kenn'st from far,"
17066,II,"Among the Pleiads a new kindl'd star,"
17067,II,"If any sparkles than the rest more bright,"
17068,II,'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.
17069,II,

17074,II,And there the last assizes keep
17075,II,For those who wake and those who sleep;

17077,II,From the four corners of the sky;
17078,II,"When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread,"

17080,II,"The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,"
17081,II,"And foremost from the tomb shall bound,"
17082,II,For they are cover'd with the lightest ground;
17083,II,"And straight, with inborn vigour, on the wing,"

18515,LISETTA'S REPLY,"There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,"
18516,LISETTA'S REPLY,There the first roses of the year shall blow;

19321,A PINDARIC ODE,Thy sober aid and native charms infuse!
19322,A PINDARIC ODE,"The flow'rs that sweetest breathe,"
19323,A PINDARIC ODE,"Though beauty cull'd the wreath,"

19364,A PINDARIC ODE,Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.
19365,A PINDARIC ODE,
19366,A PINDARIC ODE,By fairy hands their knell is rung;

19391,A PINDARIC ODE,"His small but sullen horn,"
19392,A PINDARIC ODE,
19393,A PINDARIC ODE,"As oft he rises, 'midst the twilight path"

19406,A PINDARIC ODE,"Who slept in buds the day,"
19407,A PINDARIC ODE,
19408,A PINDARIC ODE,"And many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge,"
19409,A PINDARIC ODE,"And sheds the freshening dew, and, lovelier still,"

19426,A PINDARIC ODE,The gradual dusky veil.
19427,A PINDARIC ODE,

21396,A PINDARIC ODE,Women are freed of the littand scorn:
21397,A PINDARIC ODE,O blest be the day Kilmeny was born!
21398,A PINDARIC ODE,"Now shall the land of the spirits see,"
21399,A PINDARIC ODE,Now shall it ken what a woman may be!
21400,A PINDARIC ODE,"Many a lang year, in sorrow and pain,"
21401,A PINDARIC ODE,"Many a lang year through the world we've gane,"
21402,A PINDARIC ODE,"Commission'd to watch fair womankind,"
21403,A PINDARIC ODE,For it 's they who nurice the immortal mind.
21404,A PINDARIC ODE,"We have watch'd their steps as the dawning shone,"
21405,A PINDARIC ODE,And deep in the green-wood walks alone;
21406,A PINDARIC ODE,"By lily bower and silken bed,"
21407,A PINDARIC ODE,The viewless tears have o'er them shed;
21408,A PINDARIC ODE,"Have soothed their ardent minds to sleep,"
21409,A PINDARIC ODE,Or left the couch of love to weep.
21410,A PINDARIC ODE,"We have seen! we have seen! but the time must come,"
21411,A PINDARIC ODE,And the angels will weep at the day of doom!
21412,A PINDARIC ODE,
21413,A PINDARIC ODE,'O would the fairest of mortal kind
21414,A PINDARIC ODE,"Aye keep the holy truths in mind,"
21415,A PINDARIC ODE,"That kindred spirits their motions see,"
21416,A PINDARIC ODE,"Who watch their ways with anxious e'e,"
21417,A PINDARIC ODE,And grieve for the guilt of humanitye!
21418,A PINDARIC ODE,"O, sweet to Heaven the maiden's prayer,"
21419,A PINDARIC ODE,And the sigh that heaves a bosom sae fair!
21420,A PINDARIC ODE,"And dear to Heaven the words of truth,"
21421,A PINDARIC ODE,And the praise of virtue frae beauty's mouth!
21422,A PINDARIC ODE,"And dear to the viewless forms of air,"
21423,A PINDARIC ODE,The minds that kyth as the body fair!
21424,A PINDARIC ODE,
21425,A PINDARIC ODE,"'O bonnie Kilmeny! free frae stain,"
21426,A PINDARIC ODE,"If ever you seek the world again,"
21427,A PINDARIC ODE,"That world of sin, of sorrow and fear,"
21428,A PINDARIC ODE,O tell of the joys that are waiting here;
21429,A PINDARIC ODE,And tell of the signs you shall shortly see;
21430,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of the times that are now, and the times that shall be.'--"
21431,A PINDARIC ODE,"They lifted Kilmeny, they led her away,"
21432,A PINDARIC ODE,And she walk'd in the light of a sunless day;
21433,A PINDARIC ODE,"The sky was a dome of crystal bright,"
21434,A PINDARIC ODE,"The fountain of vision, and fountain of light:"
21435,A PINDARIC ODE,"The emerald fields were of dazzling glow,"
21436,A PINDARIC ODE,And the flowers of everlasting blow.
21437,A PINDARIC ODE,"Then deep in the stream her body they laid,"
21438,A PINDARIC ODE,That her youth and beauty never might fade;
21439,A PINDARIC ODE,"And they smiled on heaven, when they saw her lie"
21440,A PINDARIC ODE,In the stream of life that wander'd bye.
21441,A PINDARIC ODE,"And she heard a song, she heard it sung,"
21442,A PINDARIC ODE,"She kenn'd not where; but sae sweetly it rung,"
21443,A PINDARIC ODE,It fell on the ear like a dream of the morn:
21444,A PINDARIC ODE,"'O, blest be the day Kilmeny was born!"
21445,A PINDARIC ODE,"Now shall the land of the spirits see,"
21446,A PINDARIC ODE,Now shall it ken what a woman may be!
21447,A PINDARIC ODE,"The sun that shines on the world sae bright,"
21448,A PINDARIC ODE,A borrow'd gleid frae the fountain of light;
21449,A PINDARIC ODE,"And the moon that sleeks the sky sae dun,"
21450,A PINDARIC ODE,"Like a gouden bow, or a beamless sun,"
21451,A PINDARIC ODE,"Shall wear away, and be seen nae mair,"
21452,A PINDARIC ODE,And the angels shall miss them travelling the air.
21453,A PINDARIC ODE,"But lang, lang after baith night and day,"
21454,A PINDARIC ODE,When the sun and the world have elyed away;
21455,A PINDARIC ODE,"When the sinner has gane to his waesome doom,"
21456,A PINDARIC ODE,Kilmeny shall smile in eternal bloom!'--
21457,A PINDARIC ODE,
21458,A PINDARIC ODE,"They bore her away, she wist not how,"
21459,A PINDARIC ODE,For she felt not arm nor rest below;
21460,A PINDARIC ODE,"But so swift they wain'd her through the light,"
21461,A PINDARIC ODE,'Twas like the motion of sound or sight;
21462,A PINDARIC ODE,"They seem'd to split the gales of air,"
21463,A PINDARIC ODE,And yet nor gale nor breeze was there.
21464,A PINDARIC ODE,"Unnumber'd groves below them grew,"
21465,A PINDARIC ODE,"They came, they pass'd, and backward flew,"
21466,A PINDARIC ODE,"Like floods of blossoms gliding on,"
21467,A PINDARIC ODE,"In moment seen, in moment gone."
21468,A PINDARIC ODE,"O, never vales to mortal view"
21469,A PINDARIC ODE,Appear'd like those o'er which they flew!
21470,A PINDARIC ODE,"That land to human spirits given,"
21471,A PINDARIC ODE,The lowermost vales of the storied heaven;
21472,A PINDARIC ODE,"From thence they can view the world below,"
21473,A PINDARIC ODE,"And heaven's blue gates with sapphires glow,"
21474,A PINDARIC ODE,More glory yet unmeet to know.
21475,A PINDARIC ODE,
21476,A PINDARIC ODE,"They bore her far to a mountain green,"
21477,A PINDARIC ODE,To see what mortal never had seen;
21478,A PINDARIC ODE,"And they seated her high on a purple sward,"
21479,A PINDARIC ODE,"And bade her heed what she saw and heard,"
21480,A PINDARIC ODE,"And note the changes the spirits wrought,"
21481,A PINDARIC ODE,For now she lived in the land of thought.
21482,A PINDARIC ODE,"She look'd, and she saw nor sun nor skies,"
21483,A PINDARIC ODE,But a crystal dome of a thousand dyes:
21484,A PINDARIC ODE,"She look'd, and she saw nae land aright,"
21485,A PINDARIC ODE,But an endless whirl of glory and light:
21486,A PINDARIC ODE,"And radiant beings went and came,"
21487,A PINDARIC ODE,"Far swifter than wind, or the linked flame."
21488,A PINDARIC ODE,She hid her e'en frae the dazzling view;
21489,A PINDARIC ODE,"She look'd again, and the scene was new."
21490,A PINDARIC ODE,
21491,A PINDARIC ODE,"She saw a sun on a summer sky,"
21492,A PINDARIC ODE,And clouds of amber sailing bye;
21493,A PINDARIC ODE,"A lovely land beneath her lay,"
21494,A PINDARIC ODE,And that land had glens and mountains gray;
21495,A PINDARIC ODE,"And that land had valleys and hoary piles,"
21496,A PINDARIC ODE,"And marled seas, and a thousand isles."
21497,A PINDARIC ODE,"Its fields were speckled, its forests green,"
21498,A PINDARIC ODE,"And its lakes were all of the dazzling sheen,"
21499,A PINDARIC ODE,"Like magic mirrors, where slumbering lay"
21500,A PINDARIC ODE,The sun and the sky and the cloudlet gray;
21501,A PINDARIC ODE,"Which heaved and trembled, and gently swung,"
21502,A PINDARIC ODE,On every shore they seem'd to be hung;
21503,A PINDARIC ODE,For there they were seen on their downward plain
21504,A PINDARIC ODE,A thousand times and a thousand again;
21505,A PINDARIC ODE,"In winding lake and placid firth,"
21506,A PINDARIC ODE,Little peaceful heavens in the bosom of earth.
21507,A PINDARIC ODE,
21508,A PINDARIC ODE,"Kilmeny sigh'd and seem'd to grieve,"
21509,A PINDARIC ODE,For she found her heart to that land did cleave;
21510,A PINDARIC ODE,"She saw the corn wave on the vale,"
21511,A PINDARIC ODE,She saw the deer run down the dale;
21512,A PINDARIC ODE,"She saw the plaid and the broad claymore,"
21513,A PINDARIC ODE,And the brows that the badge of freedom bore;
21514,A PINDARIC ODE,And she thought she had seen the land before.
21515,A PINDARIC ODE,
21516,A PINDARIC ODE,"She saw a lady sit on a throne,"
21517,A PINDARIC ODE,The fairest that ever the sun shone on!
21518,A PINDARIC ODE,"A lion lick'd her hand of milk,"
21519,A PINDARIC ODE,And she held him in a leish of silk;
21520,A PINDARIC ODE,"And a leifu' maiden stood at her knee,"
21521,A PINDARIC ODE,With a silver wand and melting e'e;
21522,A PINDARIC ODE,"Her sovereign shield till love stole in,"
21523,A PINDARIC ODE,And poison'd all the fount within.
21524,A PINDARIC ODE,
21525,A PINDARIC ODE,"Then a gruff untoward bedesman came,"
21526,A PINDARIC ODE,And hundit the lion on his dame;
21527,A PINDARIC ODE,"And the guardian maid wi' the dauntless e'e,"
21528,A PINDARIC ODE,"She dropp'd a tear, and left her knee;"
21529,A PINDARIC ODE,"And she saw till the queen frae the lion fled,"
21530,A PINDARIC ODE,Till the bonniest flower of the world lay dead;
21531,A PINDARIC ODE,"A coffin was set on a distant plain,"
21532,A PINDARIC ODE,And she saw the red blood fall like rain;
21533,A PINDARIC ODE,"Then bonnie Kilmeny's heart grew sair,"
21534,A PINDARIC ODE,"And she turn'd away, and could look nae mair."
21535,A PINDARIC ODE,
21536,A PINDARIC ODE,"Then the gruff grim carle girn'd amain,"
21537,A PINDARIC ODE,"And they trampled him down, but he rose again;"
21538,A PINDARIC ODE,"And he baited the lion to deeds of weir,"
21539,A PINDARIC ODE,Till he lapp'd the blood to the kingdom dear;
21540,A PINDARIC ODE,"And weening his head was danger-preef,"
21541,A PINDARIC ODE,"When crown'd with the rose and clover leaf,"
21542,A PINDARIC ODE,"He gowl'd at the carle, and chased him away"
21543,A PINDARIC ODE,To feed wi' the deer on the mountain gray.
21544,A PINDARIC ODE,"He gowl'd at the carle, and geck'd at Heaven,"
21545,A PINDARIC ODE,"But his mark was set, and his arles given."
21546,A PINDARIC ODE,Kilmeny a while her e'en withdrew;
21547,A PINDARIC ODE,"She look'd again, and the scene was new."
21548,A PINDARIC ODE,
21549,A PINDARIC ODE,She saw before her fair unfurl'd
21550,A PINDARIC ODE,"One half of all the glowing world,"
21551,A PINDARIC ODE,"Where oceans roll'd, and rivers ran,"
21552,A PINDARIC ODE,To bound the aims of sinful man.
21553,A PINDARIC ODE,"She saw a people, fierce and fell,"
21554,A PINDARIC ODE,Burst frae their bounds like fiends of hell;
21555,A PINDARIC ODE,"Their lilies grew, and the eagle flew;"
21556,A PINDARIC ODE,"And she herked on her ravening crew,"
21557,A PINDARIC ODE,"Till the cities and towers were wrapp'd in a blaze,"
21558,A PINDARIC ODE,And the thunder it roar'd o'er the lands and the seas.
21559,A PINDARIC ODE,"The widows they wail'd, and the red blood ran,"
21560,A PINDARIC ODE,And she threaten'd an end to the race of man;
21561,A PINDARIC ODE,"She never lened, nor stood in awe,"
21562,A PINDARIC ODE,Till caught by the lion's deadly paw.
21563,A PINDARIC ODE,"O, then the eagle swink'd for life,"
21564,A PINDARIC ODE,And brainyell'd up a mortal strife;
21565,A PINDARIC ODE,"But flew she north, or flew she south,"
21566,A PINDARIC ODE,She met wi' the gowl o' the lion's mouth.
21567,A PINDARIC ODE,
21568,A PINDARIC ODE,"With a mooted wing and waefu' maen,"
21569,A PINDARIC ODE,The eagle sought her eiry again;
21570,A PINDARIC ODE,"But lang may she cower in her bloody nest,"
21571,A PINDARIC ODE,"And lang, lang sleek her wounded breast,"
21572,A PINDARIC ODE,"Before she sey another flight,"
21573,A PINDARIC ODE,To play wi' the norland lion's might.
21574,A PINDARIC ODE,
21575,A PINDARIC ODE,"But to sing the sights Kilmeny saw,"
21576,A PINDARIC ODE,"So far surpassing nature's law,"
21577,A PINDARIC ODE,"The singer's voice wad sink away,"
21578,A PINDARIC ODE,And the string of his harp wad cease to play.
21579,A PINDARIC ODE,"But she saw till the sorrows of man were bye,"
21580,A PINDARIC ODE,And all was love and harmony;
21581,A PINDARIC ODE,"Till the stars of heaven fell calmly away,"
21582,A PINDARIC ODE,Like flakes of snaw on a winter day.
21583,A PINDARIC ODE,
21584,A PINDARIC ODE,Then Kilmeny begg'd again to see
21585,A PINDARIC ODE,The friends she had left in her own countrye;
21586,A PINDARIC ODE,"To tell of the place where she had been,"
21587,A PINDARIC ODE,And the glories that lay in the land unseen;
21588,A PINDARIC ODE,"To warn the living maidens fair,"
21589,A PINDARIC ODE,"The loved of Heaven, the spirits' care,"
21590,A PINDARIC ODE,That all whose minds unmeled remain
21591,A PINDARIC ODE,Shall bloom in beauty when time is gane.
21592,A PINDARIC ODE,
21593,A PINDARIC ODE,"With distant music, soft and deep,"
21594,A PINDARIC ODE,They lull'd Kilmeny sound asleep;
21595,A PINDARIC ODE,"And when she awaken'd, she lay her lane,"
21596,A PINDARIC ODE,"All happ'd with flowers, in the green-wood wene."
21597,A PINDARIC ODE,"When seven lang years had come and fled,"
21598,A PINDARIC ODE,"When grief was calm, and hope was dead;"
21599,A PINDARIC ODE,"When scarce was remember'd Kilmeny's name,"
21600,A PINDARIC ODE,"Late, late in a gloamin' Kilmeny came hame!"
21601,A PINDARIC ODE,"And O, her beauty was fair to see,"
21602,A PINDARIC ODE,But still and steadfast was her e'e!
21603,A PINDARIC ODE,"Such beauty bard may never declare,"
21604,A PINDARIC ODE,For there was no pride nor passion there;
21605,A PINDARIC ODE,And the soft desire of maiden's e'en
21606,A PINDARIC ODE,In that mild face could never be seen.
21607,A PINDARIC ODE,"Her seymar was the lily flower,"
21608,A PINDARIC ODE,And her cheek the moss-rose in the shower;
21609,A PINDARIC ODE,"And her voice like the distant melodye,"
21610,A PINDARIC ODE,That floats along the twilight sea.
21611,A PINDARIC ODE,"But she loved to raike the lanely glen,"
21612,A PINDARIC ODE,And keeped afar frae the haunts of men;
21613,A PINDARIC ODE,"Her holy hymns unheard to sing,"
21614,A PINDARIC ODE,"To suck the flowers, and drink the spring."
21615,A PINDARIC ODE,"But wherever her peaceful form appear'd,"
21616,A PINDARIC ODE,The wild beasts of the hill were cheer'd;
21617,A PINDARIC ODE,"The wolf play'd blythly round the field,"
21618,A PINDARIC ODE,The lordly byson low'd and kneel'd;
21619,A PINDARIC ODE,"The dun deer woo'd with manner bland,"
21620,A PINDARIC ODE,And cower'd aneath her lily hand.
21621,A PINDARIC ODE,"And when at even the woodlands rung,"
21622,A PINDARIC ODE,When hymns of other worlds she sung
21623,A PINDARIC ODE,"In ecstasy of sweet devotion,"
21624,A PINDARIC ODE,"O, then the glen was all in motion!"
21625,A PINDARIC ODE,"The wild beasts of the forest came,"
21626,A PINDARIC ODE,"Broke from their bughts and faulds the tame,"
21627,A PINDARIC ODE,"And goved around, charm'd and amazed;"
21628,A PINDARIC ODE,"Even the dull cattle croon'd and gazed,"
21629,A PINDARIC ODE,And murmur'd and look'd with anxious pain
21630,A PINDARIC ODE,For something the mystery to explain.
21631,A PINDARIC ODE,The buzzard came with the throstle-cock;
21632,A PINDARIC ODE,The corby left her houf in the rock;
21633,A PINDARIC ODE,The blackbird alang wi' the eagle flew;
21634,A PINDARIC ODE,The hind came tripping o'er the dew;
21635,A PINDARIC ODE,"The wolf and the kid their raike began,"
21636,A PINDARIC ODE,"And the tod, and the lamb, and the leveret ran;"
21637,A PINDARIC ODE,"The hawk and the hern attour them hung,"
21638,A PINDARIC ODE,And the merle and the mavis forhooy'd their young;
21639,A PINDARIC ODE,And all in a peaceful ring were hurl'd;
21640,A PINDARIC ODE,It was like an eve in a sinless world!
21641,A PINDARIC ODE,
21642,A PINDARIC ODE,When a month and a day had come and gane.
21643,A PINDARIC ODE,Kilmeny sought the green-wood wene;
21644,A PINDARIC ODE,"There laid her down on the leaves sae green,"
21645,A PINDARIC ODE,And Kilmeny on earth was never mair seen.
21646,A PINDARIC ODE,"But O, the words that fell from her mouth"
21647,A PINDARIC ODE,"Were words of wonder, and words of truth!"
21648,A PINDARIC ODE,"But all the land were in fear and dread,"
21649,A PINDARIC ODE,For they kendna whether she was living or dead.
21650,A PINDARIC ODE,"It wasna her hame, and she couldna remain;"
21651,A PINDARIC ODE,"She left this world of sorrow and pain,"
21652,A PINDARIC ODE,And return'd to the land of thought again.

21676,A PINDARIC ODE,i
21677,A PINDARIC ODE,
21678,A PINDARIC ODE,STRANGE fits of passion have I known:
21679,A PINDARIC ODE,"And I will dare to tell,"
21680,A PINDARIC ODE,"But in the lover's ear alone,"
21681,A PINDARIC ODE,What once to me befell.
21682,A PINDARIC ODE,
21683,A PINDARIC ODE,When she I loved look'd every day
21684,A PINDARIC ODE,"Fresh as a rose in June,"
21685,A PINDARIC ODE,"I to her cottage bent my way,"
21686,A PINDARIC ODE,Beneath an evening moon.
21687,A PINDARIC ODE,
21688,A PINDARIC ODE,"Upon the moon I fix'd my eye,"
21689,A PINDARIC ODE,All over the wide lea;
21690,A PINDARIC ODE,With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
21691,A PINDARIC ODE,Those paths so dear to me.
21692,A PINDARIC ODE,
21693,A PINDARIC ODE,And now we reach'd the orchard-plot;
21694,A PINDARIC ODE,"And, as we climb'd the hill,"
21695,A PINDARIC ODE,The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
21696,A PINDARIC ODE,Came near and nearer still.
21697,A PINDARIC ODE,
21698,A PINDARIC ODE,"In one of those sweet dreams I slept,"
21699,A PINDARIC ODE,Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
21700,A PINDARIC ODE,And all the while my eyes I kept
21701,A PINDARIC ODE,On the descending moon.
21702,A PINDARIC ODE,
21703,A PINDARIC ODE,My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
21704,A PINDARIC ODE,"He raised, and never stopp'd:"
21705,A PINDARIC ODE,"When down behind the cottage roof,"
21706,A PINDARIC ODE,"At once, the bright moon dropp'd."
21707,A PINDARIC ODE,

22065,A PINDARIC ODE,The very pulse of the machine;
22066,A PINDARIC ODE,"A being breathing thoughtful breath,"
22067,A PINDARIC ODE,A traveller between life and death;
22068,A PINDARIC ODE,"The reason firm, the temperate will,"
22069,A PINDARIC ODE,"Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;"
22070,A PINDARIC ODE,"A perfect Woman, nobly plann'd,"
22071,A PINDARIC ODE,"To warn, to comfort, and command;"
22072,A PINDARIC ODE,"And yet a Spirit still, and bright"
22073,A PINDARIC ODE,With something of angelic light.

22079,A PINDARIC ODE,
22080,A PINDARIC ODE,I WANDER'D lonely as a cloud
22081,A PINDARIC ODE,"That floats on high o'er vales and hills,"
22082,A PINDARIC ODE,"When all at once I saw a crowd,"
22083,A PINDARIC ODE,"A host, of golden daffodils;"
22084,A PINDARIC ODE,"Beside the lake, beneath the trees,"
22085,A PINDARIC ODE,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
22086,A PINDARIC ODE,
22087,A PINDARIC ODE,Continuous as the stars that shine
22088,A PINDARIC ODE,"And twinkle on the Milky Way,"
22089,A PINDARIC ODE,They stretch'd in never-ending line
22090,A PINDARIC ODE,Along the margin of a bay:
22091,A PINDARIC ODE,"Ten thousand saw I at a glance,"
22092,A PINDARIC ODE,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
22093,A PINDARIC ODE,
22094,A PINDARIC ODE,The waves beside them danced; but they
22095,A PINDARIC ODE,Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
22096,A PINDARIC ODE,"A poet could not but be gay,"
22097,A PINDARIC ODE,In such a jocund company:
22098,A PINDARIC ODE,I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
22099,A PINDARIC ODE,What wealth the show to me had brought:
22100,A PINDARIC ODE,
22101,A PINDARIC ODE,"For oft, when on my couch I lie"
22102,A PINDARIC ODE,"In vacant or in pensive mood,"
22103,A PINDARIC ODE,They flash upon that inward eye
22104,A PINDARIC ODE,Which is the bliss of solitude;
22105,A PINDARIC ODE,"And then my heart with pleasure fills,"
22106,A PINDARIC ODE,And dances with the daffodils.

22111,A PINDARIC ODE,531. Ode to Duty
22112,A PINDARIC ODE,
22113,A PINDARIC ODE,STERN Daughter of the Voice of God!
22114,A PINDARIC ODE,"O Duty! if that name thou love,"
22115,A PINDARIC ODE,"Who art a light to guide, a rod"
22116,A PINDARIC ODE,To check the erring and reprove;
22117,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou, who art victory and law"
22118,A PINDARIC ODE,When empty terrors overawe;
22119,A PINDARIC ODE,From vain temptations dost set free;
22120,A PINDARIC ODE,And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity!
22121,A PINDARIC ODE,
22122,A PINDARIC ODE,There are who ask not if thine eye
22123,A PINDARIC ODE,"Be on them; who, in love and truth,"
22124,A PINDARIC ODE,"Where no misgiving is, rely"
22125,A PINDARIC ODE,Upon the genial sense of youth:
22126,A PINDARIC ODE,Glad hearts! without reproach or blot;
22127,A PINDARIC ODE,"Who do thy work, and know it not:"
22128,A PINDARIC ODE,"O, if through confidence misplaced"
22129,A PINDARIC ODE,"They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast."
22130,A PINDARIC ODE,
22131,A PINDARIC ODE,"Serene will be our days and bright,"
22132,A PINDARIC ODE,"And happy will our nature be,"
22133,A PINDARIC ODE,"When love is an unerring light,"
22134,A PINDARIC ODE,And joy its own security.
22135,A PINDARIC ODE,And they a blissful course may hold
22136,A PINDARIC ODE,"Even now, who, not unwisely bold,"
22137,A PINDARIC ODE,Live in the spirit of this creed;
22138,A PINDARIC ODE,"Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need."
22139,A PINDARIC ODE,
22140,A PINDARIC ODE,"I, loving freedom, and untried;"
22141,A PINDARIC ODE,"No sport of every random gust,"
22142,A PINDARIC ODE,"Yet being to myself a guide,"
22143,A PINDARIC ODE,Too blindly have reposed my trust:
22144,A PINDARIC ODE,"And oft, when in my heart was heard"
22145,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thy timely mandate, I deferr'd"
22146,A PINDARIC ODE,"The task, in smoother walks to stray;"
22147,A PINDARIC ODE,"But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may."
22148,A PINDARIC ODE,
22149,A PINDARIC ODE,"Through no disturbance of my soul,"
22150,A PINDARIC ODE,"Or strong compunction in me wrought,"
22151,A PINDARIC ODE,I supplicate for thy control;
22152,A PINDARIC ODE,But in the quietness of thought.
22153,A PINDARIC ODE,Me this uncharter'd freedom tires;
22154,A PINDARIC ODE,I feel the weight of chance-desires;
22155,A PINDARIC ODE,"My hopes no more must change their name,"
22156,A PINDARIC ODE,I long for a repose that ever is the same.
22157,A PINDARIC ODE,
22158,A PINDARIC ODE,Yet not the less would I throughout
22159,A PINDARIC ODE,Still act according to the voice
22160,A PINDARIC ODE,Of my own wish; and feel past doubt
22161,A PINDARIC ODE,That my submissiveness was choice:
22162,A PINDARIC ODE,Not seeking in the school of pride
22163,A PINDARIC ODE,"For 'precepts over dignified,'"
22164,A PINDARIC ODE,Denial and restraint I prize
22165,A PINDARIC ODE,No farther than they breed a second Will more wise.
22166,A PINDARIC ODE,
22167,A PINDARIC ODE,Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
22168,A PINDARIC ODE,The Godhead's most benignant grace;
22169,A PINDARIC ODE,Nor know we anything so fair
22170,A PINDARIC ODE,As is the smile upon thy face:
22171,A PINDARIC ODE,"Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,"
22172,A PINDARIC ODE,And fragrance in thy footing treads;
22173,A PINDARIC ODE,Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;
22174,A PINDARIC ODE,"And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong."
22175,A PINDARIC ODE,
22176,A PINDARIC ODE,"To humbler functions, awful Power!"
22177,A PINDARIC ODE,I call thee: I myself commend
22178,A PINDARIC ODE,Unto thy guidance from this hour;
22179,A PINDARIC ODE,"O, let my weakness have an end!"
22180,A PINDARIC ODE,"Give unto me, made lowly wise,"
22181,A PINDARIC ODE,The spirit of self-sacrifice;
22182,A PINDARIC ODE,The confidence of reason give;
22183,A PINDARIC ODE,And in the light of truth thy bondman let me live!

22188,A PINDARIC ODE,532. The Rainbow
22189,A PINDARIC ODE,
22190,A PINDARIC ODE,MY heart leaps up when I behold
22191,A PINDARIC ODE,A rainbow in the sky:
22192,A PINDARIC ODE,So was it when my life began;
22193,A PINDARIC ODE,So is it now I am a man;
22194,A PINDARIC ODE,"So be it when I shall grow old,"
22195,A PINDARIC ODE,Or let me die!
22196,A PINDARIC ODE,The Child is father of the Man;
22197,A PINDARIC ODE,I could wish my days to be
22198,A PINDARIC ODE,Bound each to each by natural piety.

22204,A PINDARIC ODE,i
22205,A PINDARIC ODE,
22206,A PINDARIC ODE,"NUNS fret not at their convent's narrow room,"
22207,A PINDARIC ODE,"And hermits are contented with their cells,"
22208,A PINDARIC ODE,And students with their pensive citadels;
22209,A PINDARIC ODE,"Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,"
22210,A PINDARIC ODE,"Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,"
22211,A PINDARIC ODE,"High as the highest peak of Furness fells,"
22212,A PINDARIC ODE,Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
22213,A PINDARIC ODE,In truth the prison unto which we doom
22214,A PINDARIC ODE,"Ourselves no prison is: and hence for me,"
22215,A PINDARIC ODE,"In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound"
22216,A PINDARIC ODE,Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground;
22217,A PINDARIC ODE,Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be)
22218,A PINDARIC ODE,"Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,"
22219,A PINDARIC ODE,"Should find brief solace there, as I have found."

22224,A PINDARIC ODE,534. The Sonnet
22225,A PINDARIC ODE,ii
22226,A PINDARIC ODE,
22227,A PINDARIC ODE,"SCORN not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frown'd,"
22228,A PINDARIC ODE,Mindless of its just honours; with this key
22229,A PINDARIC ODE,Shakespeare unlock'd his heart; the melody
22230,A PINDARIC ODE,Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;
22231,A PINDARIC ODE,A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
22232,A PINDARIC ODE,With it Camöens sooth'd an exile's grief;
22233,A PINDARIC ODE,The Sonnet glitter'd a gay myrtle leaf
22234,A PINDARIC ODE,Amid the cypress with which Dante crown'd
22235,A PINDARIC ODE,"His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,"
22236,A PINDARIC ODE,"It cheer'd mild Spenser, call'd from Faery-land"
22237,A PINDARIC ODE,To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
22238,A PINDARIC ODE,"Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand"
22239,A PINDARIC ODE,The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
22240,A PINDARIC ODE,"Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!"

22245,A PINDARIC ODE,535. The World
22246,A PINDARIC ODE,
22247,A PINDARIC ODE,"THE world is too much with us; late and soon,"
22248,A PINDARIC ODE,"Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:"
22249,A PINDARIC ODE,Little we see in Nature that is ours;
22250,A PINDARIC ODE,"We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!"
22251,A PINDARIC ODE,This sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
22252,A PINDARIC ODE,"The winds that will be howling at all hours,"
22253,A PINDARIC ODE,And are up-gather'd now like sleeping flowers;
22254,A PINDARIC ODE,"For this, for everything, we are out of tune;"
22255,A PINDARIC ODE,It moves us not.--Great God! I'd rather be
22256,A PINDARIC ODE,A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
22257,A PINDARIC ODE,"So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,"
22258,A PINDARIC ODE,Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
22259,A PINDARIC ODE,Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
22260,A PINDARIC ODE,Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.

22265,A PINDARIC ODE,536. Ode
22266,A PINDARIC ODE,Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood
22267,A PINDARIC ODE,
22268,A PINDARIC ODE,"THERE was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,"
22269,A PINDARIC ODE,"The earth, and every common sight,"
22270,A PINDARIC ODE,To me did seem
22271,A PINDARIC ODE,"Apparell'd in celestial light,"
22272,A PINDARIC ODE,The glory and the freshness of a dream.
22273,A PINDARIC ODE,It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
22274,A PINDARIC ODE,"Turn wheresoe'er I may,"
22275,A PINDARIC ODE,"By night or day,"
22276,A PINDARIC ODE,The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
22277,A PINDARIC ODE,
22278,A PINDARIC ODE,"The rainbow comes and goes,"
22279,A PINDARIC ODE,And lovely is the rose;
22280,A PINDARIC ODE,The moon doth with delight
22281,A PINDARIC ODE,Look round her when the heavens are bare;
22282,A PINDARIC ODE,Waters on a starry night
22283,A PINDARIC ODE,Are beautiful and fair;
22284,A PINDARIC ODE,The sunshine is a glorious birth;
22285,A PINDARIC ODE,"But yet I know, where'er I go,"
22286,A PINDARIC ODE,That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth.
22287,A PINDARIC ODE,
22288,A PINDARIC ODE,"Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,"
22289,A PINDARIC ODE,And while the young lambs bound
22290,A PINDARIC ODE,"As to the tabor's sound,"
22291,A PINDARIC ODE,To me alone there came a thought of grief:
22292,A PINDARIC ODE,"A timely utterance gave that thought relief,"
22293,A PINDARIC ODE,And I again am strong:
22294,A PINDARIC ODE,The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
22295,A PINDARIC ODE,No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
22296,A PINDARIC ODE,"I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,"
22297,A PINDARIC ODE,"The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,"
22298,A PINDARIC ODE,And all the earth is gay;
22299,A PINDARIC ODE,Land and sea
22300,A PINDARIC ODE,"Give themselves up to jollity,"
22301,A PINDARIC ODE,And with the heart of May
22302,A PINDARIC ODE,Doth every beast keep holiday;--
22303,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou Child of Joy,"
22304,A PINDARIC ODE,"Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy"
22305,A PINDARIC ODE,Shepherd-boy!
22306,A PINDARIC ODE,
22307,A PINDARIC ODE,"Ye blessed creatures, I have heard the call"
22308,A PINDARIC ODE,Ye to each other make; I see
22309,A PINDARIC ODE,The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
22310,A PINDARIC ODE,"My heart is at your festival,"
22311,A PINDARIC ODE,"My head hath its coronal,"
22312,A PINDARIC ODE,"The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all."
22313,A PINDARIC ODE,O evil day! if I were sullen
22314,A PINDARIC ODE,"While Earth herself is adorning,"
22315,A PINDARIC ODE,"This sweet May-morning,"
22316,A PINDARIC ODE,And the children are culling
22317,A PINDARIC ODE,"On every side,"
22318,A PINDARIC ODE,"In a thousand valleys far and wide,"
22319,A PINDARIC ODE,"Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,"
22320,A PINDARIC ODE,And the babe leaps up on his mother's arm:--
22321,A PINDARIC ODE,"I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!"
22322,A PINDARIC ODE,"--But there's a tree, of many, one,"
22323,A PINDARIC ODE,"A single field which I have look'd upon,"
22324,A PINDARIC ODE,Both of them speak of something that is gone:
22325,A PINDARIC ODE,The pansy at my feet
22326,A PINDARIC ODE,Doth the same tale repeat:
22327,A PINDARIC ODE,Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
22328,A PINDARIC ODE,"Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
22329,A PINDARIC ODE,
22330,A PINDARIC ODE,Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
22331,A PINDARIC ODE,"The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,"
22332,A PINDARIC ODE,"Hath had elsewhere its setting,"
22333,A PINDARIC ODE,And cometh from afar:
22334,A PINDARIC ODE,"Not in entire forgetfulness,"
22335,A PINDARIC ODE,"And not in utter nakedness,"
22336,A PINDARIC ODE,But trailing clouds of glory do we come
22337,A PINDARIC ODE,"From God, who is our home:"
22338,A PINDARIC ODE,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
22339,A PINDARIC ODE,Shades of the prison-house begin to close
22340,A PINDARIC ODE,"Upon the growing Boy,"
22341,A PINDARIC ODE,"But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,"
22342,A PINDARIC ODE,He sees it in his joy;
22343,A PINDARIC ODE,"The Youth, who daily farther from the east"
22344,A PINDARIC ODE,"Must travel, still is Nature's priest,"
22345,A PINDARIC ODE,And by the vision splendid
22346,A PINDARIC ODE,Is on his way attended;
22347,A PINDARIC ODE,"At length the Man perceives it die away,"
22348,A PINDARIC ODE,And fade into the light of common day.
22349,A PINDARIC ODE,
22350,A PINDARIC ODE,Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
22351,A PINDARIC ODE,"Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,"
22352,A PINDARIC ODE,"And, even with something of a mother's mind,"
22353,A PINDARIC ODE,"And no unworthy aim,"
22354,A PINDARIC ODE,The homely nurse doth all she can
22355,A PINDARIC ODE,"To make her foster-child, her Inmate Man,"
22356,A PINDARIC ODE,"Forget the glories he hath known,"
22357,A PINDARIC ODE,And that imperial palace whence he came.
22358,A PINDARIC ODE,
22359,A PINDARIC ODE,"Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,"
22360,A PINDARIC ODE,A six years' darling of a pigmy size!
22361,A PINDARIC ODE,"See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,"
22362,A PINDARIC ODE,"Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,"
22363,A PINDARIC ODE,With light upon him from his father's eyes!
22364,A PINDARIC ODE,"See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,"
22365,A PINDARIC ODE,"Some fragment from his dream of human life,"
22366,A PINDARIC ODE,Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
22367,A PINDARIC ODE,"A wedding or a festival,"
22368,A PINDARIC ODE,A mourning or a funeral;
22369,A PINDARIC ODE,"And this hath now his heart,"
22370,A PINDARIC ODE,And unto this he frames his song:
22371,A PINDARIC ODE,Then will he fit his tongue
22372,A PINDARIC ODE,"To dialogues of business, love, or strife;"
22373,A PINDARIC ODE,But it will not be long
22374,A PINDARIC ODE,"Ere this be thrown aside,"
22375,A PINDARIC ODE,And with new joy and pride
22376,A PINDARIC ODE,The little actor cons another part;
22377,A PINDARIC ODE,Filling from time to time his 'humorous stage'
22378,A PINDARIC ODE,"With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,"
22379,A PINDARIC ODE,That Life brings with her in her equipage;
22380,A PINDARIC ODE,As if his whole vocation
22381,A PINDARIC ODE,Were endless imitation.
22382,A PINDARIC ODE,
22383,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie"
22384,A PINDARIC ODE,Thy soul's immensity;
22385,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep"
22386,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind,"
22387,A PINDARIC ODE,"That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,"
22388,A PINDARIC ODE,"Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,--"
22389,A PINDARIC ODE,Mighty prophet! Seer blest!
22390,A PINDARIC ODE,"On whom those truths do rest,"
22391,A PINDARIC ODE,"Which we are toiling all our lives to find,"
22392,A PINDARIC ODE,"In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;"
22393,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou, over whom thy Immortality"
22394,A PINDARIC ODE,"Broods like the Day, a master o'er a slave,"
22395,A PINDARIC ODE,A presence which is not to be put by;
22396,A PINDARIC ODE,To whom the grave
22397,A PINDARIC ODE,Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
22398,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of day or the warm light,"
22399,A PINDARIC ODE,A place of thought where we in waiting lie;
22400,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might"
22401,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height,"
22402,A PINDARIC ODE,Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
22403,A PINDARIC ODE,"The years to bring the inevitable yoke,"
22404,A PINDARIC ODE,Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
22405,A PINDARIC ODE,"Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,"
22406,A PINDARIC ODE,"And custom lie upon thee with a weight,"
22407,A PINDARIC ODE,"Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!"
22408,A PINDARIC ODE,
22409,A PINDARIC ODE,O joy! that in our embers
22410,A PINDARIC ODE,"Is something that doth live,"
22411,A PINDARIC ODE,That nature yet remembers
22412,A PINDARIC ODE,What was so fugitive!
22413,A PINDARIC ODE,The thought of our past years in me doth breed
22414,A PINDARIC ODE,Perpetual benediction: not indeed
22415,A PINDARIC ODE,For that which is most worthy to be blest--
22416,A PINDARIC ODE,"Delight and liberty, the simple creed"
22417,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,"
22418,A PINDARIC ODE,With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:--
22419,A PINDARIC ODE,Not for these I raise
22420,A PINDARIC ODE,The song of thanks and praise;
22421,A PINDARIC ODE,But for those obstinate questionings
22422,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of sense and outward things,"
22423,A PINDARIC ODE,"Fallings from us, vanishings;"
22424,A PINDARIC ODE,Blank misgivings of a Creature
22425,A PINDARIC ODE,"Moving about in worlds not realized,"
22426,A PINDARIC ODE,High instincts before which our mortal Nature
22427,A PINDARIC ODE,Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
22428,A PINDARIC ODE,"But for those first affections,"
22429,A PINDARIC ODE,"Those shadowy recollections,"
22430,A PINDARIC ODE,"Which, be they what they may,"
22431,A PINDARIC ODE,"Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,"
22432,A PINDARIC ODE,Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
22433,A PINDARIC ODE,"Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make"
22434,A PINDARIC ODE,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
22435,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,"
22436,A PINDARIC ODE,To perish never:
22437,A PINDARIC ODE,"Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,"
22438,A PINDARIC ODE,"Nor Man nor Boy,"
22439,A PINDARIC ODE,"Nor all that is at enmity with joy,"
22440,A PINDARIC ODE,Can utterly abolish or destroy!
22441,A PINDARIC ODE,Hence in a season of calm weather
22442,A PINDARIC ODE,"Though inland far we be,"
22443,A PINDARIC ODE,Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
22444,A PINDARIC ODE,"Which brought us hither,"
22445,A PINDARIC ODE,"Can in a moment travel thither,"
22446,A PINDARIC ODE,"And see the children sport upon the shore,"
22447,A PINDARIC ODE,And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
22448,A PINDARIC ODE,
22449,A PINDARIC ODE,"Then sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!"
22450,A PINDARIC ODE,And let the young lambs bound
22451,A PINDARIC ODE,As to the tabor's sound!
22452,A PINDARIC ODE,"We in thought will join your throng,"
22453,A PINDARIC ODE,"Ye that pipe and ye that play,"
22454,A PINDARIC ODE,Ye that through your hearts to-day
22455,A PINDARIC ODE,Feel the gladness of the May!
22456,A PINDARIC ODE,What though the radiance which was once so bright
22457,A PINDARIC ODE,"Be now for ever taken from my sight,"
22458,A PINDARIC ODE,Though nothing can bring back the hour
22459,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;"
22460,A PINDARIC ODE,"We will grieve not, rather find"
22461,A PINDARIC ODE,Strength in what remains behind;
22462,A PINDARIC ODE,In the primal sympathy
22463,A PINDARIC ODE,Which having been must ever be;
22464,A PINDARIC ODE,In the soothing thoughts that spring
22465,A PINDARIC ODE,Out of human suffering;
22466,A PINDARIC ODE,"In the faith that looks through death,"
22467,A PINDARIC ODE,In years that bring the philosophic mind.
22468,A PINDARIC ODE,
22469,A PINDARIC ODE,"And O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,"
22470,A PINDARIC ODE,Forebode not any severing of our loves!
22471,A PINDARIC ODE,Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
22472,A PINDARIC ODE,I only have relinquish'd one delight
22473,A PINDARIC ODE,To live beneath your more habitual sway.
22474,A PINDARIC ODE,"I love the brooks which down their channels fret,"
22475,A PINDARIC ODE,Even more than when I tripp'd lightly as they;
22476,A PINDARIC ODE,The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
22477,A PINDARIC ODE,Is lovely yet;
22478,A PINDARIC ODE,The clouds that gather round the setting sun
22479,A PINDARIC ODE,Do take a sober colouring from an eye
22480,A PINDARIC ODE,That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
22481,A PINDARIC ODE,"Another race hath been, and other palms are won."
22482,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thanks to the human heart by which we live,"
22483,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,"
22484,A PINDARIC ODE,To me the meanest flower that blows can give
22485,A PINDARIC ODE,Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

22491,A PINDARIC ODE,
22492,A PINDARIC ODE,SURPRISED by joy--impatient as the Wind
22493,A PINDARIC ODE,I turned to share the transport--O! with whom
22494,A PINDARIC ODE,"But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb,"
22495,A PINDARIC ODE,That spot which no vicissitude can find?
22496,A PINDARIC ODE,"Love, faithful love, recall'd thee to my mind--"
22497,A PINDARIC ODE,"But how could I forget thee? Through what power,"
22498,A PINDARIC ODE,"Even for the least division of an hour,"
22499,A PINDARIC ODE,Have I been so beguiled as to be blind
22500,A PINDARIC ODE,To my most grievous loss?--That thought's return
22501,A PINDARIC ODE,"Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,"
22502,A PINDARIC ODE,"Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,"
22503,A PINDARIC ODE,Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;
22504,A PINDARIC ODE,"That neither present time, nor years unborn"
22505,A PINDARIC ODE,Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.

22511,A PINDARIC ODE,
22512,A PINDARIC ODE,"I THOUGHT of Thee, my partner and my guide,"
22513,A PINDARIC ODE,As being pass'd away.--Vain sympathies!
22514,A PINDARIC ODE,"For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,"
22515,A PINDARIC ODE,"I see what was, and is, and will abide;"
22516,A PINDARIC ODE,"Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;"
22517,A PINDARIC ODE,"The Form remains, the Function never dies;"
22518,A PINDARIC ODE,"While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,"
22519,A PINDARIC ODE,"We Men, who in our morn of youth defied"
22520,A PINDARIC ODE,"The elements, must vanish;--be it so!"
22521,A PINDARIC ODE,"Enough, if something from our hands have power"
22522,A PINDARIC ODE,"To live, and act, and serve the future hour;"
22523,A PINDARIC ODE,"And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,"
22524,A PINDARIC ODE,"Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,"
22525,A PINDARIC ODE,We feel that we are greater than we know.

22531,A PINDARIC ODE,
22532,A PINDARIC ODE,"FROM low to high doth dissolution climb,"
22533,A PINDARIC ODE,"And sink from high to low, along a scale"
22534,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;"
22535,A PINDARIC ODE,"A musical but melancholy chime,"
22536,A PINDARIC ODE,"Which they can hear who meddle not with crime,"
22537,A PINDARIC ODE,"Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care."
22538,A PINDARIC ODE,Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear
22539,A PINDARIC ODE,"The longest date do melt like frosty rime,"
22540,A PINDARIC ODE,That in the morning whiten'd hill and plain
22541,A PINDARIC ODE,And is no more; drop like the tower sublime
22542,A PINDARIC ODE,"Of yesterday, which royally did wear"
22543,A PINDARIC ODE,"His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain"
22544,A PINDARIC ODE,"Some casual shout that broke the silent air,"

22551,A PINDARIC ODE,
22552,A PINDARIC ODE,"THERE 's not a nook within this solemn Pass,"
22553,A PINDARIC ODE,But were an apt confessional for one
22554,A PINDARIC ODE,"Taught by his summer spent, his autumn gone,"
22555,A PINDARIC ODE,That Life is but a tale of morning grass
22556,A PINDARIC ODE,Wither'd at eve. From scenes of art which chase
22557,A PINDARIC ODE,"That thought away, turn, and with watchful eyes"
22558,A PINDARIC ODE,"Feed it 'mid Nature's old felicities,"
22559,A PINDARIC ODE,"Rocks, rivers, and smooth lakes more clear than glass"
22560,A PINDARIC ODE,"Untouch'd, unbreathed upon. Thrice happy quest,"
22561,A PINDARIC ODE,If from a golden perch of aspen spray
22562,A PINDARIC ODE,(October's workmanship to rival May)
22563,A PINDARIC ODE,The pensive warbler of the ruddy breast

22571,A PINDARIC ODE,
22572,A PINDARIC ODE,WHY art thou silent! Is thy love a plant
22573,A PINDARIC ODE,Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
22574,A PINDARIC ODE,Of absence withers what was once so fair?
22575,A PINDARIC ODE,"Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?"
22576,A PINDARIC ODE,Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant--
22577,A PINDARIC ODE,"Bound to thy service with unceasing care,"
22578,A PINDARIC ODE,The mind's least generous wish a mendicant
22579,A PINDARIC ODE,For nought but what thy happiness could spare.
22580,A PINDARIC ODE,"Speak--though this soft warm heart, once free to hold"
22581,A PINDARIC ODE,"A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,"
22582,A PINDARIC ODE,"Be left more desolate, more dreary cold"
22583,A PINDARIC ODE,Than a forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow
22584,A PINDARIC ODE,'Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--

22594,A PINDARIC ODE,"Sweet Robin sits on the bush,"
22595,A PINDARIC ODE,Singing so rarely.
22596,A PINDARIC ODE,
22597,A PINDARIC ODE,"'Tell me, thou bonny bird,"
22598,A PINDARIC ODE,When shall I marry me?'

22618,A PINDARIC ODE,"And Greta woods are green,"
22619,A PINDARIC ODE,"And you may gather garlands there,"
22620,A PINDARIC ODE,Would grace a summer queen:
22621,A PINDARIC ODE,"And as I rode by Dalton Hall,"
22622,A PINDARIC ODE,"Beneath the turrets high,"
22623,A PINDARIC ODE,A Maiden on the castle wall
22624,A PINDARIC ODE,Was singing merrily:--
22625,A PINDARIC ODE,
22626,A PINDARIC ODE,"'O, Brignall banks are fresh and fair,"
22627,A PINDARIC ODE,And Greta woods are green!

22629,A PINDARIC ODE,Than reign our English Queen.'

22631,A PINDARIC ODE,"'If, Maiden, thou wouldst wend with me"
22632,A PINDARIC ODE,"To leave both tower and town,"
22633,A PINDARIC ODE,"Thou first must guess what life lead we,"
22634,A PINDARIC ODE,That dwell by dale and down:
22635,A PINDARIC ODE,"And if thou canst that riddle read,"
22636,A PINDARIC ODE,"As read full well you may,"
22637,A PINDARIC ODE,Then to the green-wood shalt thou speed
22638,A PINDARIC ODE,As blithe as Queen of May.'
22639,A PINDARIC ODE,
22640,A PINDARIC ODE,"Yet sung she, 'Brignall banks are fair,"
22641,A PINDARIC ODE,And Greta woods are green!
22642,A PINDARIC ODE,I'd rather rove with Edmund there
22643,A PINDARIC ODE,Than reign our English Queen.
22644,A PINDARIC ODE,

22664,A PINDARIC ODE,No more the trumpet hear;

22830,A PINDARIC ODE,With Palinure's unalter'd mood
22831,A PINDARIC ODE,Firm at his dangerous post he stood;
22832,A PINDARIC ODE,"Each call for needful rest repell'd,"

22890,A PINDARIC ODE,Jostling by dark intrigue for place;
22891,A PINDARIC ODE,"Like fabled gods, their mighty war"
22892,A PINDARIC ODE,Shook realms and nations in its jar;
22893,A PINDARIC ODE,"Beneath each banner proud to stand,"

22972,PART I,
22973,PART I,The Wedding-Guest heareth the bridal music; but the Mariner continueth
22974,PART I,his tale.
22975,PART I,
22976,PART I,"The bride hath paced into the hall,"
22977,PART I,Red as a rose is she;
22978,PART I,Nodding their heads before her goes
22979,PART I,The merry minstrelsy.
22980,PART I,
22981,PART I,"The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,"
22982,PART I,Yet he cannot choose but hear;
22983,PART I,"And thus spake on that ancient man,"
22984,PART I,The bright-eyed Mariner.
22985,PART I,
22986,PART I,The ship drawn by a storm toward the South Pole.
22987,PART I,
22988,PART I,"'And now the Storm-blast came, and he"
22989,PART I,Was tyrannous and strong:
22990,PART I,"He struck with his o'ertaking wings,"
22991,PART I,And chased us south along.
22992,PART I,
22993,PART I,"With sloping masts and dipping prow,"
22994,PART I,As who pursued with yell and blow
22995,PART I,"Still treads the shadow of his foe,"

22997,PART I,"The ship drove fast, loud roar'd the blast,"
22998,PART I,The southward aye we fled.
22999,PART I,
23000,PART I,"And now there came both mist and snow,"
23001,PART I,And it grew wondrous cold:
23002,PART I,"And ice, mast-high, came floating by,"
23003,PART I,As green as emerald.
23004,PART I,
23005,PART I,"The land of ice, and of fearful sounds, where no living thing was to"
23006,PART I,be seen.
23007,PART I,
23008,PART I,And through the drifts the snowy clifts
23009,PART I,Did send a dismal sheen:
23010,PART I,Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--
23011,PART I,The ice was all between.
23012,PART I,
23013,PART I,"The ice was here, the ice was there,"
23014,PART I,The ice was all around:
23015,PART I,"It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd,"
23016,PART I,Like noises in a swound!
23017,PART I,
23018,PART I,"Till a great sea-bird, called the Albatross, came through the"
23019,PART I,"snow-fog, and was received with great joy and hospitality."
23020,PART I,
23021,PART I,"At length did cross an Albatross,"
23022,PART I,Thorough the fog it came;
23023,PART I,"As if it had been a Christian soul,"
23024,PART I,We hail'd it in God's name.
23025,PART I,
23026,PART I,"It ate the food it ne'er had eat,"
23027,PART I,And round and round it flew.
23028,PART I,The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
23029,PART I,The helmsman steer'd us through!
23030,PART I,
23031,PART I,"And lo! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the ship as it returned northward through fog and floating ice."
23032,PART I,
23033,PART I,And a good south wind sprung up behind;
23034,PART I,"The Albatross did follow,"
23035,PART I,"And every day, for food or play,"
23036,PART I,Came to the mariners' hollo!
23037,PART I,
23038,PART I,"In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,"
23039,PART I,It perch'd for vespers nine;
23040,PART I,"Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,"
23041,PART I,Glimmer'd the white moonshine.'
23042,PART I,
23043,PART I,The ancient Mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of good omen.

23045,PART I,"'God save thee, ancient Mariner!"
23046,PART I,"From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--"

23055,PART II,Went down into the sea.
23056,PART II,
23057,PART II,"And the good south wind still blew behind,"
23058,PART II,"But no sweet bird did follow,"
23059,PART II,Nor any day for food or play
23060,PART II,Came to the mariners' hollo!
23061,PART II,
23062,PART II,His shipmates cry out against the ancient Mariner for killing the bird
23063,PART II,of good luck.
23064,PART II,
23065,PART II,"And I had done an hellish thing,"
23066,PART II,And it would work 'em woe:
23067,PART II,"For all averr'd, I had kill'd the bird"
23068,PART II,That made the breeze to blow.
23069,PART II,"Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,"
23070,PART II,That made the breeze to blow!
23071,PART II,
23072,PART II,"But when the fog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus make"

23078,PART II,That brought the fog and mist.
23079,PART II,"'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,"
23080,PART II,That bring the fog and mist.

23084,PART II,

23146,PART II,"Instead of the cross, the Albatross"
23147,PART II,About my neck was hung.
23148,PART II,
23149,PART III,PART III
23150,PART III,
23151,PART III,'There passed a weary time. Each throat
23152,PART III,"Was parch'd, and glazed each eye."
23153,PART III,A weary time! a weary time!
23154,PART III,How glazed each weary eye!
23155,PART III,"When looking westward, I beheld"
23156,PART III,A something in the sky.
23157,PART III,
23158,PART III,The ancient Mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar off.
23159,PART III,
23160,PART III,"At first it seem'd a little speck,"
23161,PART III,And then it seem'd a mist;
23162,PART III,"It moved and moved, and took at last"
23163,PART III,"A certain shape, I wist."
23164,PART III,
23165,PART III,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!"
23166,PART III,And still it near'd and near'd:
23167,PART III,"As if it dodged a water-sprite,"
23168,PART III,"It plunged, and tack'd, and veer'd."
23169,PART III,
23170,PART III,"At its nearer approach, it seemeth him to be a ship; and at a dear"
23171,PART III,ransom he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst.
23172,PART III,
23173,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
23174,PART III,We could nor laugh nor wail;
23175,PART III,Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
23176,PART III,"I bit my arm, I suck'd the blood,"
23177,PART III,"And cried, A sail! a sail!"
23178,PART III,
23179,PART III,A flash of joy;
23180,PART III,
23181,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
23182,PART III,Agape they heard me call:
23183,PART III,"Gramercy! they for joy did grin,"
23184,PART III,"And all at once their breath drew in,"
23185,PART III,As they were drinking all.
23186,PART III,
23187,PART III,And horror follows. For can it be a ship that comes onward without
23188,PART III,wind or tide?
23189,PART III,
23190,PART III,See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
23191,PART III,Hither to work us weal--
23192,PART III,"Without a breeze, without a tide,"
23193,PART III,She steadies with upright keel!
23194,PART III,
23195,PART III,"The western wave was all aflame,"
23196,PART III,The day was wellnigh done!
23197,PART III,Almost upon the western wave
23198,PART III,"Rested the broad, bright Sun;"
23199,PART III,When that strange shape drove suddenly
23200,PART III,Betwixt us and the Sun.
23201,PART III,
23202,PART III,It seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship.
23203,PART III,
23204,PART III,And straight the Sun was fleck'd with bars
23205,PART III,"(Heaven's Mother send us grace!),"
23206,PART III,As if through a dungeon-grate he peer'd
23207,PART III,With broad and burning face.
23208,PART III,
23209,PART III,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
23210,PART III,How fast she nears and nears!
23211,PART III,"Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,"
23212,PART III,Like restless gossameres?
23213,PART III,
23214,PART III,And its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting Sun. The
23215,PART III,"Spectre-Woman and her Death-mate, and no other on board the skeleton"
23216,PART III,"ship. Like vessel, like crew!"
23217,PART III,
23218,PART III,Are those her ribs through which the Sun
23219,PART III,"Did peer, as through a grate?"
23220,PART III,And is that Woman all her crew?
23221,PART III,Is that a Death? and are there two?
23222,PART III,Is Death that Woman's mate?
23223,PART III,
23224,PART III,"Her lips were red, her looks were free,"
23225,PART III,Her locks were yellow as gold:
23226,PART III,"Her skin was as white as leprosy,"
23227,PART III,"The Nightmare Life-in-Death was she,"
23228,PART III,Who thicks man's blood with cold.
23229,PART III,
23230,PART III,"Death and Life-in-Death have diced for the ship's crew, and she (the"
23231,PART III,latter) winneth the ancient Mariner.
23232,PART III,
23233,PART III,"The naked hulk alongside came,"
23234,PART III,And the twain were casting dice;
23235,PART III,"""The game is done! I've won! I've won!"""
23236,PART III,"Quoth she, and whistles thrice."
23237,PART III,
23238,PART III,No twilight within the courts of the Sun.
23239,PART III,
23240,PART III,The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
23241,PART III,At one stride comes the dark;
23242,PART III,"With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,"
23243,PART III,Off shot the spectre-bark.
23244,PART III,
23245,PART III,We listen'd and look'd sideways up!
23246,PART III,"Fear at my heart, as at a cup,"
23247,PART III,My life-blood seem'd to sip!
23248,PART III,"The stars were dim, and thick the night,"
23249,PART III,The steersman's face by his lamp gleam'd white;
23250,PART III,From the sails the dew did drip--
23251,PART III,Till clomb above the eastern bar
23252,PART III,"The horned Moon, with one bright star"
23253,PART III,Within the nether tip.
23254,PART III,
23255,PART III,"At the rising of the Moon,"
23256,PART III,"One after another,"
23257,PART III,
23258,PART III,"One after one, by the star-dogg'd Moon,"
23259,PART III,"Too quick for groan or sigh,"
23260,PART III,"Each turn'd his face with a ghastly pang,"
23261,PART III,And cursed me with his eye.
23262,PART III,
23263,PART III,His shipmates drop down dead.
23264,PART III,
23265,PART III,Four times fifty living men
23266,PART III,"(And I heard nor sigh nor groan),"
23267,PART III,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,"
23268,PART III,They dropp'd down one by one.
23269,PART III,
23270,PART III,But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner.
23271,PART III,
23272,PART III,The souls did from their bodies fly--
23273,PART III,They fled to bliss or woe!
23274,PART III,"And every soul, it pass'd me by"
23275,PART III,Like the whizz of my crossbow!'
23276,PART III,
23277,PART IV,PART IV
23278,PART IV,
23279,PART IV,The Wedding-Guest feareth that a spirit is talking to him;
23280,PART IV,
23281,PART IV,"'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
23282,PART IV,I fear thy skinny hand!
23283,PART IV,"And thou art long, and lank, and brown,"
23284,PART IV,As is the ribb'd sea-sand.
23285,PART IV,
23286,PART IV,"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,"
23287,PART IV,And thy skinny hand so brown.'--
23288,PART IV,"'Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!"
23289,PART IV,This body dropt not down.
23290,PART IV,
23291,PART IV,"But the ancient Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and"
23292,PART IV,proceedeth to relate his horrible penance.
23293,PART IV,
23294,PART IV,"Alone, alone, all, all alone,"
23295,PART IV,"Alone on a wide, wide sea!"
23296,PART IV,And never a saint took pity on
23297,PART IV,My soul in agony.
23298,PART IV,
23299,PART IV,He despiseth the creatures of the calm.
23300,PART IV,
23301,PART IV,"The many men, so beautiful!"
23302,PART IV,And they all dead did lie:
23303,PART IV,And a thousand thousand slimy things
23304,PART IV,Lived on; and so did I.
23305,PART IV,
23306,PART IV,"And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead."
23307,PART IV,
23308,PART IV,"I look'd upon the rotting sea,"
23309,PART IV,And drew my eyes away;
23310,PART IV,"I look'd upon the rotting deck,"
23311,PART IV,And there the dead men lay.
23312,PART IV,
23313,PART IV,"I look'd to heaven, and tried to pray;"
23314,PART IV,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
23315,PART IV,"A wicked whisper came, and made"
23316,PART IV,My heart as dry as dust.
23317,PART IV,
23318,PART IV,"I closed my lids, and kept them close,"
23319,PART IV,And the balls like pulses beat;
23320,PART IV,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky,"
23321,PART IV,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
23322,PART IV,And the dead were at my feet.
23323,PART IV,
23324,PART IV,But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.
23325,PART IV,
23326,PART IV,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
23327,PART IV,Nor rot nor reek did they:
23328,PART IV,The look with which they look'd on me
23329,PART IV,Had never pass'd away.
23330,PART IV,
23331,PART IV,An orphan's curse would drag to hell
23332,PART IV,A spirit from on high;
23333,PART IV,But oh! more horrible than that
23334,PART IV,Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
23335,PART IV,"Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,"
23336,PART IV,And yet I could not die.
23337,PART IV,
23338,PART IV,In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying
23339,PART IV,"Moon, and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward; and"
23340,PART IV,"everywhere the blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest"
23341,PART IV,"and their native country and their own natural homes, which they enter"
23342,PART IV,"unannounced, as lords that are certainly expected, and yet there is a"
23343,PART IV,silent joy at their arrival.
23344,PART IV,
23345,PART IV,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
23346,PART IV,And nowhere did abide;
23347,PART IV,"Softly she was going up,"
23348,PART IV,And a star or two beside--
23349,PART IV,
23350,PART IV,"Her beams bemock'd the sultry main,"
23351,PART IV,Like April hoar-frost spread;
23352,PART IV,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
23353,PART IV,The charmed water burnt alway
23354,PART IV,A still and awful red.
23355,PART IV,
23356,PART IV,By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the great
23357,PART IV,calm.
23358,PART IV,
23359,PART IV,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
23360,PART IV,I watch'd the water-snakes:
23361,PART IV,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
23362,PART IV,"And when they rear'd, the elfish light"
23363,PART IV,Fell off in hoary flakes.
23364,PART IV,
23365,PART IV,Within the shadow of the ship
23366,PART IV,I watch'd their rich attire:
23367,PART IV,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
23368,PART IV,They coil'd and swam; and every track
23369,PART IV,Was a flash of golden fire.
23370,PART IV,
23371,PART IV,Their beauty and their happiness.
23372,PART IV,
23373,PART IV,O happy living things! no tongue
23374,PART IV,Their beauty might declare:
23375,PART IV,"A spring of love gush'd from my heart,"
23376,PART IV,And I bless'd them unaware:
23377,PART IV,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
23378,PART IV,And I bless'd them unaware.
23379,PART IV,
23380,PART IV,He blesseth them in his heart.
23381,PART IV,The spell begins to break.
23382,PART IV,
23383,PART IV,The selfsame moment I could pray;
23384,PART IV,And from my neck so free
23385,PART IV,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
23386,PART IV,Like lead into the sea.
23387,PART IV,
23388,PART V,PART V
23389,PART V,
23390,PART V,"'O sleep! it is a gentle thing,"
23391,PART V,Beloved from pole to pole!
23392,PART V,To Mary Queen the praise be given!
23393,PART V,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,"
23394,PART V,That slid into my soul.
23395,PART V,
23396,PART V,"By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with"
23397,PART V,rain.
23398,PART V,
23399,PART V,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
23400,PART V,"That had so long remain'd,"
23401,PART V,I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew;
23402,PART V,"And when I awoke, it rain'd."
23403,PART V,
23404,PART V,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
23405,PART V,My garments all were dank;
23406,PART V,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
23407,PART V,And still my body drank.
23408,PART V,
23409,PART V,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:"
23410,PART V,I was so light--almost
23411,PART V,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
23412,PART V,And was a blessed ghost.
23413,PART V,
23414,PART V,He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky
23415,PART V,and the element.
23416,PART V,
23417,PART V,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
23418,PART V,It did not come anear;
23419,PART V,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
23420,PART V,That were so thin and sere.
23421,PART V,
23422,PART V,The upper air burst into life;
23423,PART V,And a hundred fire-flags sheen;
23424,PART V,To and fro they were hurried about!
23425,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
23426,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
23427,PART V,
23428,PART V,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
23429,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
23430,PART V,And the rain pour'd down from one black cloud;
23431,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
23432,PART V,
23433,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
23434,PART V,The Moon was at its side;
23435,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
23436,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,"
23437,PART V,A river steep and wide.
23438,PART V,
23439,PART V,"The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired, and the ship moves on;"
23440,PART V,
23441,PART V,"The loud wind never reach'd the ship,"
23442,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
23443,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
23444,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.
23445,PART V,
23446,PART V,"They groan'd, they stirr'd, they all uprose,"
23447,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
23448,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
23449,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
23450,PART V,
23451,PART V,"The helmsman steer'd, the ship moved on;"
23452,PART V,Yet never a breeze up-blew;
23453,PART V,"The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,"
23454,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
23455,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
23456,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.
23457,PART V,
23458,PART V,The body of my brother's son
23459,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
23460,PART V,"The body and I pull'd at one rope,"
23461,PART V,But he said naught to me.'
23462,PART V,
23463,PART V,"But not by the souls of the men, nor by demons of earth or middle air,"
23464,PART V,"but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation"
23465,PART V,of the guardian saint.
23466,PART V,
23467,PART V,"'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!'"
23468,PART V,"Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest:"
23469,PART V,"'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
23470,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
23471,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
23472,PART V,
23473,PART V,"For when it dawn'd--they dropp'd their arms,"
23474,PART V,And cluster'd round the mast;
23475,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
23476,PART V,And from their bodies pass'd.
23477,PART V,
23478,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
23479,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;
23480,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
23481,PART V,"Now mix'd, now one by one."
23482,PART V,
23483,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
23484,PART V,I heard the skylark sing;
23485,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,"
23486,PART V,How they seem'd to fill the sea and air
23487,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
23488,PART V,
23489,PART V,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
23490,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
23491,PART V,"And now it is an angel's song,"
23492,PART V,That makes the Heavens be mute.
23493,PART V,
23494,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
23495,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
23496,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
23497,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,"
23498,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
23499,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
23500,PART V,
23501,PART V,"Till noon we quietly sail'd on,"
23502,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
23503,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,"
23504,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
23505,PART V,
23506,PART V,The lonesome Spirit from the South Pole carries on the ship as far as
23507,PART V,"the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth"
23508,PART V,vengeance.
23509,PART V,
23510,PART V,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
23511,PART V,"From the land of mist and snow,"
23512,PART V,The Spirit slid: and it was he
23513,PART V,That made the ship to go.
23514,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
23515,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
23516,PART V,
23517,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
23518,PART V,Had fix'd her to the ocean:
23519,PART V,"But in a minute she 'gan stir,"
23520,PART V,With a short uneasy motion--
23521,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
23522,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
23523,PART V,
23524,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
23525,PART V,She made a sudden bound:
23526,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
23527,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.
23528,PART V,
23529,PART V,"The Polar Spirit's fellow-demons, the invisible inhabitants of the"
23530,PART V,"element, take part in his wrong; and two of them relate, one to the"
23531,PART V,"other, that penance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been"
23532,PART V,"accorded to the Polar Spirit, who returneth southward."
23533,PART V,
23534,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
23535,PART V,I have not to declare;
23536,PART V,"But ere my living life return'd,"
23537,PART V,"I heard, and in my soul discern'd"
23538,PART V,Two voices in the air.
23539,PART V,
23540,PART V,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""is this the man?"
23541,PART V,"By Him who died on cross,"
23542,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low
23543,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
23544,PART V,
23545,PART V,The Spirit who bideth by himself
23546,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
23547,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
23548,PART V,"Who shot him with his bow."""
23549,PART V,
23550,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
23551,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
23552,PART V,"Quoth he, ""The man hath penance done,"
23553,PART V,"And penance more will do."""
23554,PART V,
23555,PART VI,PART VI
23556,PART VI,
23557,PART VI,"First Voice: '""But tell me, tell me! speak again,"
23558,PART VI,Thy soft response renewing--
23559,PART VI,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
23560,PART VI,"What is the Ocean doing?"""
23561,PART VI,
23562,PART VI,"Second Voice: ""Still as a slave before his lord,"
23563,PART VI,The Ocean hath no blast;
23564,PART VI,His great bright eye most silently
23565,PART VI,Up to the Moon is cast--
23566,PART VI,
23567,PART VI,If he may know which way to go;
23568,PART VI,For she guides him smooth or grim.
23569,PART VI,"See, brother, see! how graciously"
23570,PART VI,"She looketh down on him."""
23571,PART VI,
23572,PART VI,The Mariner hath been cast into a trance; for the angelic power
23573,PART VI,causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than human life could
23574,PART VI,endure.

23576,PART VI,"First Voice: ""But why drives on that ship so fast,"
23577,PART VI,"Without or wave or wind?"""
23578,PART VI,
23579,PART VI,"Second Voice: ""The air is cut away before,"
23580,PART VI,And closes from behind.
23581,PART VI,
23582,PART VI,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"
23583,PART VI,Or we shall be belated:
23584,PART VI,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
23585,PART VI,When the Mariner's trance is abated.'
23586,PART VI,
23587,PART VI,"The supernatural motion is retarded; the Mariner awakes, and his"
23588,PART VI,penance begins anew.
23589,PART VI,
23590,PART VI,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
23591,PART VI,As in a gentle weather:
23592,PART VI,"'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;"
23593,PART VI,The dead men stood together.
23594,PART VI,
23595,PART VI,"All stood together on the deck,"
23596,PART VI,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
23597,PART VI,"All fix'd on me their stony eyes,"
23598,PART VI,That in the Moon did glitter.
23599,PART VI,
23600,PART VI,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
23601,PART VI,Had never pass'd away:
23602,PART VI,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,"
23603,PART VI,Nor turn them up to pray.
23604,PART VI,
23605,PART VI,The curse is finally expiated.
23606,PART VI,
23607,PART VI,And now this spell was snapt: once more
23608,PART VI,"I viewed the ocean green,"
23609,PART VI,"And look'd far forth, yet little saw"
23610,PART VI,Of what had else been seen--
23611,PART VI,
23612,PART VI,Like one that on a lonesome road
23613,PART VI,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
23614,PART VI,"And having once turn'd round, walks on,"
23615,PART VI,And turns no more his head;
23616,PART VI,Because he knows a frightful fiend
23617,PART VI,Doth close behind him tread.
23618,PART VI,
23619,PART VI,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
23620,PART VI,Nor sound nor motion made:
23621,PART VI,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
23622,PART VI,In ripple or in shade.
23623,PART VI,
23624,PART VI,"It raised my hair, it fann'd my cheek"
23625,PART VI,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
23626,PART VI,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
23627,PART VI,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
23628,PART VI,
23629,PART VI,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,"
23630,PART VI,Yet she sail'd softly too:
23631,PART VI,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
23632,PART VI,On me alone it blew.
23633,PART VI,
23634,PART VI,And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.
23635,PART VI,
23636,PART VI,O dream of joy! is this indeed
23637,PART VI,The lighthouse top I see?
23638,PART VI,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
23639,PART VI,Is this mine own countree?
23640,PART VI,
23641,PART VI,"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,"
23642,PART VI,And I with sobs did pray--
23643,PART VI,"O let me be awake, my God!"
23644,PART VI,Or let me sleep alway.
23645,PART VI,
23646,PART VI,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
23647,PART VI,So smoothly it was strewn!
23648,PART VI,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
23649,PART VI,And the shadow of the Moon.
23650,PART VI,
23651,PART VI,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less"
23652,PART VI,That stands above the rock:
23653,PART VI,The moonlight steep'd in silentness
23654,PART VI,The steady weathercock.
23655,PART VI,
23656,PART VI,"The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,"
23657,PART VI,
23658,PART VI,And the bay was white with silent light
23659,PART VI,"Till rising from the same,"
23660,PART VI,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
23661,PART VI,In crimson colours came.
23662,PART VI,
23663,PART VI,And appear in their own forms of light.
23664,PART VI,
23665,PART VI,A little distance from the prow
23666,PART VI,Those crimson shadows were:
23667,PART VI,I turn'd my eyes upon the deck--
23668,PART VI,O Christ! what saw I there!
23669,PART VI,
23670,PART VI,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
23671,PART VI,"And, by the holy rood!"
23672,PART VI,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
23673,PART VI,On every corse there stood.
23674,PART VI,
23675,PART VI,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
23676,PART VI,It was a heavenly sight!
23677,PART VI,"They stood as signals to the land,"
23678,PART VI,Each one a lovely light;
23679,PART VI,
23680,PART VI,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
23681,PART VI,No voice did they impart--
23682,PART VI,"No voice; but O, the silence sank"
23683,PART VI,Like music on my heart.
23684,PART VI,
23685,PART VI,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
23686,PART VI,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
23687,PART VI,"My head was turn'd perforce away,"
23688,PART VI,And I saw a boat appear.
23689,PART VI,
23690,PART VI,"The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,"
23691,PART VI,I heard them coming fast:
23692,PART VI,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
23693,PART VI,The dead men could not blast.
23694,PART VI,
23695,PART VI,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
23696,PART VI,It is the Hermit good!
23697,PART VI,He singeth loud his godly hymns
23698,PART VI,That he makes in the wood.
23699,PART VI,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
23700,PART VI,The Albatross's blood.
23701,PART VI,
23702,PART VII,PART VII
23703,PART VII,
23704,PART VII,The Hermit of the Wood.
23705,PART VII,
23706,PART VII,'This Hermit good lives in that wood
23707,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.
23708,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
23709,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
23710,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
23711,PART VII,
23712,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
23713,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:
23714,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
23715,PART VII,The rotted old oak-stump.
23716,PART VII,
23717,PART VII,"The skiff-boat near'd: I heard them talk,"
23718,PART VII,"""Why, this is strange, I trow!"
23719,PART VII,"Where are those lights so many and fair,"
23720,PART VII,"That signal made but now?"""
23721,PART VII,
23722,PART VII,Approacheth the ship with wonder.
23723,PART VII,
23724,PART VII,"""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--"
23725,PART VII,"""And they answer'd not our cheer!"
23726,PART VII,"The planks looked warp'd! and see those sails,"
23727,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!
23728,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"
23729,PART VII,Unless perchance it were
23730,PART VII,
23731,PART VII,Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
23732,PART VII,My forest-brook along;
23733,PART VII,"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
23734,PART VII,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"
23735,PART VII,"That eats the she-wolf's young."""
23736,PART VII,
23737,PART VII,"""Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--"
23738,PART VII,(The Pilot made reply)
23739,PART VII,"I am a-fear'd""--""Push on, push on!"""
23740,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
23741,PART VII,
23742,PART VII,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
23743,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirr'd;
23744,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
23745,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.
23746,PART VII,
23747,PART VII,The ship suddenly sinketh.
23748,PART VII,
23749,PART VII,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
23750,PART VII,Still louder and more dread:
23751,PART VII,"It reach'd the ship, it split the bay;"
23752,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
23753,PART VII,
23754,PART VII,The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat.
23755,PART VII,
23756,PART VII,"Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,"
23757,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
23758,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drown'd
23759,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
23760,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
23761,PART VII,Within the Pilot's boat.
23762,PART VII,
23763,PART VII,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
23764,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
23765,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
23766,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
23767,PART VII,
23768,PART VII,I moved my lips--the Pilot shriek'd
23769,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
23770,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
23771,PART VII,And pray'd where he did sit.
23772,PART VII,
23773,PART VII,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
23774,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,"
23775,PART VII,"Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while"
23776,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
23777,PART VII,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see"
23778,PART VII,"The Devil knows how to row."""
23779,PART VII,
23780,PART VII,"And now, all in my own countree,"
23781,PART VII,I stood on the firm land!
23782,PART VII,"The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,"
23783,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
23784,PART VII,
23785,PART VII,The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to shrieve him;
23786,PART VII,and the penance of life falls on him.
23787,PART VII,
23788,PART VII,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"""
23789,PART VII,The Hermit cross'd his brow.
23790,PART VII,"""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say--"
23791,PART VII,"What manner of man art thou?"""
23792,PART VII,
23793,PART VII,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
23794,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"
23795,PART VII,Which forced me to begin my tale;
23796,PART VII,And then it left me free.
23797,PART VII,
23798,PART VII,And ever and anon throughout his future life an agony constraineth him
23799,PART VII,to travel from land to land;
23800,PART VII,
23801,PART VII,"Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
23802,PART VII,That agony returns:
23803,PART VII,"And till my ghastly tale is told,"
23804,PART VII,This heart within me burns.
23805,PART VII,
23806,PART VII,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
23807,PART VII,I have strange power of speech;
23808,PART VII,"That moment that his face I see,"
23809,PART VII,I know the man that must hear me:
23810,PART VII,To him my tale I teach.
23811,PART VII,
23812,PART VII,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
23813,PART VII,The wedding-guests are there:
23814,PART VII,But in the garden-bower the bride
23815,PART VII,And bride-maids singing are:
23816,PART VII,"And hark the little vesper bell,"
23817,PART VII,Which biddeth me to prayer!
23818,PART VII,
23819,PART VII,O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
23820,PART VII,"Alone on a wide, wide sea:"
23821,PART VII,"So lonely 'twas, that God Himself"
23822,PART VII,Scarce seemed there to be.
23823,PART VII,
23824,PART VII,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"
23825,PART VII,"'Tis sweeter far to me,"
23826,PART VII,To walk together to the kirk
23827,PART VII,With a goodly company!--
23828,PART VII,
23829,PART VII,"To walk together to the kirk,"
23830,PART VII,"And all together pray,"
23831,PART VII,"While each to his great Father bends,"
23832,PART VII,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends,"
23833,PART VII,And youths and maidens gay!
23834,PART VII,
23835,PART VII,"And to teach, by his own example, love and reverence to all things"
23836,PART VII,that God made and loveth.
23837,PART VII,
23838,PART VII,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
23839,PART VII,"To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"
23840,PART VII,"He prayeth well, who loveth well"
23841,PART VII,Both man and bird and beast.
23842,PART VII,
23843,PART VII,"He prayeth best, who loveth best"
23844,PART VII,All things both great and small;
23845,PART VII,"For the dear God who loveth us,"
23846,PART VII,He made and loveth all.'
23847,PART VII,
23848,PART VII,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,"
23849,PART VII,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
23850,PART VII,Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest
23851,PART VII,Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.
23852,PART VII,
23853,PART VII,"He went like one that hath been stunn'd,"
23854,PART VII,And is of sense forlorn:
23855,PART VII,A sadder and a wiser man
23856,PART VII,He rose the morrow morn.

23862,PART VII,
23863,PART VII,IN Xanadu did Kubla Khan
23864,PART VII,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
23865,PART VII,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
23866,PART VII,Through caverns measureless to man
23867,PART VII,Down to a sunless sea.
23868,PART VII,So twice five miles of fertile ground
23869,PART VII,With walls and towers were girdled round:
23870,PART VII,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
23871,PART VII,Where blossom'd many an incense-bearing tree;
23872,PART VII,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
23873,PART VII,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
23874,PART VII,
23875,PART VII,"But O, that deep romantic chasm which slanted"
23876,PART VII,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
23877,PART VII,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
23878,PART VII,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
23879,PART VII,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
23880,PART VII,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"
23881,PART VII,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
23882,PART VII,A mighty fountain momently was forced;
23883,PART VII,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
23884,PART VII,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
23885,PART VII,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
23886,PART VII,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
23887,PART VII,It flung up momently the sacred river.
23888,PART VII,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
23889,PART VII,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
23890,PART VII,"Then reach'd the caverns measureless to man,"
23891,PART VII,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
23892,PART VII,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
23893,PART VII,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
23894,PART VII,
23895,PART VII,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
23896,PART VII,Floated midway on the waves;
23897,PART VII,Where was heard the mingled measure
23898,PART VII,From the fountain and the caves.
23899,PART VII,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
23900,PART VII,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
23901,PART VII,
23902,PART VII,A damsel with a dulcimer
23903,PART VII,In a vision once I saw:
23904,PART VII,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"
23905,PART VII,"And on her dulcimer she play'd,"
23906,PART VII,Singing of Mount Abora.
23907,PART VII,"Could I revive within me,"
23908,PART VII,"Her symphony and song,"
23909,PART VII,"To such a deep delight 'twould win me,"
23910,PART VII,"That with music loud and long,"
23911,PART VII,"I would build that dome in air,"
23912,PART VII,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
23913,PART VII,"And all who heard should see them there,"
23914,PART VII,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
23915,PART VII,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
23916,PART VII,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
23917,PART VII,"And close your eyes with holy dread,"
23918,PART VII,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
23919,PART VII,And drunk the milk of Paradise.

23931,PART VII,Oft in my waking dreams do I
23932,PART VII,"Live o'er again that happy hour,"

23935,PART VII,
23936,PART VII,"The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene,"
23937,PART VII,Had blended with the lights of eve;
23938,PART VII,"And she was there, my hope, my joy,"
23939,PART VII,My own dear Genevieve!
23940,PART VII,
23941,PART VII,"She lean'd against the armed man,"
23942,PART VII,The statue of the armed Knight;
23943,PART VII,"She stood and listen'd to my lay,"
23944,PART VII,Amid the lingering light.
23945,PART VII,

23947,PART VII,My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!
23948,PART VII,She loves me best whene'er I sing
23949,PART VII,The songs that make her grieve.
23950,PART VII,
23951,PART VII,I play'd a soft and doleful air;
23952,PART VII,I sang an old and moving story--
23953,PART VII,"An old rude song, that suited well"
23954,PART VII,That ruin wild and hoary.
23955,PART VII,
23956,PART VII,"She listen'd with a flitting blush,"
23957,PART VII,With downcast eyes and modest grace;
23958,PART VII,For well she knew I could not choose
23959,PART VII,But gaze upon her face.
23960,PART VII,
23961,PART VII,I told her of the Knight that wore
23962,PART VII,Upon his shield a burning brand;
23963,PART VII,And that for ten long years he woo'd
23964,PART VII,The Lady of the Land.
23965,PART VII,
23966,PART VII,I told her how he pined: and ah!
23967,PART VII,"The deep, the low, the pleading tone"
23968,PART VII,"With which I sang another's love,"
23969,PART VII,Interpreted my own.
23970,PART VII,
23971,PART VII,"She listen'd with a flitting blush,"
23972,PART VII,"With downcast eyes, and modest grace;"
23973,PART VII,"And she forgave me, that I gazed"
23974,PART VII,Too fondly on her face!
23975,PART VII,
23976,PART VII,But when I told the cruel scorn
23977,PART VII,"That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,"
23978,PART VII,"And that he cross'd the mountain-woods,"
23979,PART VII,Nor rested day nor night;
23980,PART VII,
23981,PART VII,"That sometimes from the savage den,"
23982,PART VII,"And sometimes from the darksome shade,"
23983,PART VII,And sometimes starting up at once
23984,PART VII,In green and sunny glade--
23985,PART VII,
23986,PART VII,There came and look'd him in the face
23987,PART VII,An angel beautiful and bright;
23988,PART VII,"And that he knew it was a Fiend,"
23989,PART VII,This miserable Knight!
23990,PART VII,
23991,PART VII,"And that, unknowing what he did,"
23992,PART VII,"He leap'd amid a murderous band,"
23993,PART VII,And saved from outrage worse than death
23994,PART VII,The Lady of the Land;--
23995,PART VII,
23996,PART VII,And how she wept and clasp'd his knees;
23997,PART VII,And how she tended him in vain--
23998,PART VII,And ever strove to expiate
23999,PART VII,The scorn that crazed his brain;--
24000,PART VII,
24001,PART VII,And that she nursed him in a cave;
24002,PART VII,"And how his madness went away,"
24003,PART VII,When on the yellow forest leaves
24004,PART VII,A dying man he lay;--
24005,PART VII,
24006,PART VII,His dying words--but when I reach'd
24007,PART VII,"That tenderest strain of all the ditty,"
24008,PART VII,My faltering voice and pausing harp
24009,PART VII,Disturb'd her soul with pity!
24010,PART VII,
24011,PART VII,All impulses of soul and sense

24026,PART VII,"Her bosom heaved--she stepp'd aside,"

24058,PART VII,"This breathing house not built with hands,"

24063,PART VII,"On winding lakes and rivers wide,"
24064,PART VII,"That ask no aid of sail or oar,"
24065,PART VII,That fear no spite of wind or tide!

24081,PART VII,And thou wert aye a masker bold!

24417,AN ALLEGORY,"Lightly advancing thro' her star-trimm'd crowd,"
24418,AN ALLEGORY,"Ianthe said, and look'd into my eyes."
24419,AN ALLEGORY,"'A yes, a yes to both: for Memory"
24420,AN ALLEGORY,"Where you but once have been must ever be,"
24421,AN ALLEGORY,And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise.'

24429,AN ALLEGORY,About the bard of Sirmio.
24430,AN ALLEGORY,"Yes, in Thalia's son"
24431,AN ALLEGORY,Such stains there are--as when a Grace

24449,AN ALLEGORY,
24450,AN ALLEGORY,AN ancient chestnut's blossoms threw
24451,AN ALLEGORY,Their heavy odour over two:
24452,AN ALLEGORY,"Leucippe, it is said, was one;"
24453,AN ALLEGORY,"The other, then, was Alciphron."
24454,AN ALLEGORY,"'Come, come! why should we stand beneath"
24455,AN ALLEGORY,This hollow tree's unwholesome breath?'
24456,AN ALLEGORY,"Said Alciphron, 'here 's not a blade"
24457,AN ALLEGORY,"Of grass or moss, and scanty shade."
24458,AN ALLEGORY,Come; it is just the hour to rove
24459,AN ALLEGORY,In the lone dingle shepherds love;
24460,AN ALLEGORY,"There, straight and tall, the hazel twig"
24461,AN ALLEGORY,"Divides the crooked rock-held fig,"
24462,AN ALLEGORY,O'er the blue pebbles where the rill
24463,AN ALLEGORY,In winter runs and may run still.
24464,AN ALLEGORY,"Come then, while fresh and calm the air,"
24465,AN ALLEGORY,And while the shepherds are not there.'
24466,AN ALLEGORY,
24467,AN ALLEGORY,Leucippe. But I would rather go when they
24468,AN ALLEGORY,Sit round about and sing and play.
24469,AN ALLEGORY,Then why so hurry me? for you
24470,AN ALLEGORY,"Like play and song, and shepherds too."
24471,AN ALLEGORY,
24472,AN ALLEGORY,"Alciphron. I like the shepherds very well,"
24473,AN ALLEGORY,"And song and play, as you can tell."
24474,AN ALLEGORY,"But there is play, I sadly fear,"
24475,AN ALLEGORY,And song I would not have you hear.
24476,AN ALLEGORY,
24477,AN ALLEGORY,Leucippe. What can it be? What can it be?
24478,AN ALLEGORY,
24479,AN ALLEGORY,Alciphron. To you may none of them repeat
24480,AN ALLEGORY,"The play that you have play'd with me,"
24481,AN ALLEGORY,The song that made your bosom beat.
24482,AN ALLEGORY,
24483,AN ALLEGORY,Leucippe. Don't keep your arm about my waist.
24484,AN ALLEGORY,
24485,AN ALLEGORY,Alciphron. Might you not stumble?
24486,AN ALLEGORY,
24487,AN ALLEGORY,"Leucippe.                     Well then, do."
24488,AN ALLEGORY,But why are we in all this haste?
24489,AN ALLEGORY,
24490,AN ALLEGORY,Alciphron. To sing.
24491,AN ALLEGORY,
24492,AN ALLEGORY,Leucippe.           Alas! and not play too?

24499,AN ALLEGORY,"YEARS, many parti-colour'd years,"
24500,AN ALLEGORY,"Some have crept on, and some have flown"
24501,AN ALLEGORY,Since first before me fell those tears
24502,AN ALLEGORY,I never could see fall alone.
24503,AN ALLEGORY,
24504,AN ALLEGORY,"Years, not so many, are to come,"
24505,AN ALLEGORY,"Years not so varied, when from you"

24513,AN ALLEGORY,
24514,AN ALLEGORY,"THERE is a mountain and a wood between us,"
24515,AN ALLEGORY,Where the lone shepherd and late bird have seen us
24516,AN ALLEGORY,Morning and noon and eventide repass.
24517,AN ALLEGORY,Between us now the mountain and the wood
24518,AN ALLEGORY,"Seem standing darker than last year they stood,"
24519,AN ALLEGORY,And say we must not cross--alas! alas!

24529,AN ALLEGORY,Scarcely on any bough is heard
24530,AN ALLEGORY,"Joyous, or even unjoyous, bird"
24531,AN ALLEGORY,The whole wood through.
24532,AN ALLEGORY,
24533,AN ALLEGORY,Winter may come: he brings but nigher
24534,AN ALLEGORY,His circle (yearly narrowing) to the fire
24535,AN ALLEGORY,Where old friends meet.
24536,AN ALLEGORY,"Let him; now heaven is overcast,"
24537,AN ALLEGORY,"And spring and summer both are past,"

24558,AN ALLEGORY,

24562,AN ALLEGORY,

24566,AN ALLEGORY,
24567,AN ALLEGORY,"I have a friend, a kinder friend has no man:"
24568,AN ALLEGORY,"Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly;"
24569,AN ALLEGORY,"Left him, to muse on the old familiar faces."
24570,AN ALLEGORY,
24571,AN ALLEGORY,"Ghost-like I paced round the haunts of my childhood,"
24572,AN ALLEGORY,"Earth seem'd a desert I was bound to traverse,"
24573,AN ALLEGORY,Seeking to find the old familiar faces.
24574,AN ALLEGORY,
24575,AN ALLEGORY,"Friend of my bosom, thou more than a brother,"
24576,AN ALLEGORY,Why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling?
24577,AN ALLEGORY,So might we talk of the old familiar faces--
24578,AN ALLEGORY,
24579,AN ALLEGORY,"How some they have died, and some they have left me,"

24587,AN ALLEGORY,
24588,AN ALLEGORY,WHEN maidens such as Hester die
24589,AN ALLEGORY,"Their place ye may not well supply,"
24590,AN ALLEGORY,Though ye among a thousand try
24591,AN ALLEGORY,With vain endeavour.
24592,AN ALLEGORY,
24593,AN ALLEGORY,"A month or more hath she been dead,"
24594,AN ALLEGORY,Yet cannot I by force be led
24595,AN ALLEGORY,To think upon the wormy bed
24596,AN ALLEGORY,And her together.
24597,AN ALLEGORY,
24598,AN ALLEGORY,"A springy motion in her gait,"
24599,AN ALLEGORY,"A rising step, did indicate"
24600,AN ALLEGORY,"Of pride and joy no common rate,"
24601,AN ALLEGORY,That flush'd her spirit:
24602,AN ALLEGORY,
24603,AN ALLEGORY,I know not by what name beside
24604,AN ALLEGORY,"I shall it call: if 'twas not pride,"
24605,AN ALLEGORY,"It was a joy to that allied,"
24606,AN ALLEGORY,She did inherit.
24607,AN ALLEGORY,
24608,AN ALLEGORY,"Her parents held the Quaker rule,"
24609,AN ALLEGORY,Which doth the human feeling cool;
24610,AN ALLEGORY,But she was train'd in Nature's school;
24611,AN ALLEGORY,Nature had blest her.
24612,AN ALLEGORY,

24625,AN ALLEGORY,"A bliss that would not go away,"
24626,AN ALLEGORY,A sweet forewarning?

24631,AN ALLEGORY,579. On an Infant dying as soon as born
24632,AN ALLEGORY,
24633,AN ALLEGORY,I SAW where in the shroud did lurk
24634,AN ALLEGORY,A curious frame of Nature's work;
24635,AN ALLEGORY,"A floweret crush'd in the bud,"
24636,AN ALLEGORY,"A nameless piece of Babyhood,"
24637,AN ALLEGORY,Was in her cradle-coffin lying;
24638,AN ALLEGORY,"Extinct, with scarce the sense of dying:"
24639,AN ALLEGORY,So soon to exchange the imprisoning womb
24640,AN ALLEGORY,For darker closets of the tomb!
24641,AN ALLEGORY,"She did but ope an eye, and put"
24642,AN ALLEGORY,"A clear beam forth, then straight up shut"
24643,AN ALLEGORY,For the long dark: ne'er more to see
24644,AN ALLEGORY,Through glasses of mortality.
24645,AN ALLEGORY,"Riddle of destiny, who can show"
24646,AN ALLEGORY,"What thy short visit meant, or know"
24647,AN ALLEGORY,What thy errand here below?
24648,AN ALLEGORY,Shall we say that Nature blind
24649,AN ALLEGORY,"Check'd her hand, and changed her mind,"
24650,AN ALLEGORY,Just when she had exactly wrought
24651,AN ALLEGORY,A finish'd pattern without fault?
24652,AN ALLEGORY,"Could she flag, or could she tire,"
24653,AN ALLEGORY,Or lack'd she the Promethean fire
24654,AN ALLEGORY,(With her nine moons' long workings sicken'd)
24655,AN ALLEGORY,That should thy little limbs have quicken'd?
24656,AN ALLEGORY,"Limbs so firm, they seem'd to assure"
24657,AN ALLEGORY,"Life of health, and days mature:"
24658,AN ALLEGORY,Woman's self in miniature!
24659,AN ALLEGORY,"Limbs so fair, they might supply"
24660,AN ALLEGORY,(Themselves now but cold imagery)
24661,AN ALLEGORY,The sculptor to make Beauty by.
24662,AN ALLEGORY,Or did the stern-eyed Fate descry
24663,AN ALLEGORY,"That babe or mother, one must die;"
24664,AN ALLEGORY,So in mercy left the stock
24665,AN ALLEGORY,And cut the branch; to save the shock
24666,AN ALLEGORY,"Of young years widow'd, and the pain"
24667,AN ALLEGORY,When single state comes back again
24668,AN ALLEGORY,"To the lone man who, reft of wife,"
24669,AN ALLEGORY,Thenceforward drags a maimed life?
24670,AN ALLEGORY,"The economy of Heaven is dark,"
24671,AN ALLEGORY,"And wisest clerks have miss'd the mark,"
24672,AN ALLEGORY,"Why human buds, like this, should fall,"
24673,AN ALLEGORY,More brief than fly ephemeral
24674,AN ALLEGORY,That has his day; while shrivell'd crones
24675,AN ALLEGORY,Stiffen with age to stocks and stones;
24676,AN ALLEGORY,And crabbed use the conscience sears
24677,AN ALLEGORY,In sinners of an hundred years.
24678,AN ALLEGORY,"Mother's prattle, mother's kiss,"
24679,AN ALLEGORY,"Baby fond, thou ne'er wilt miss:"

24683,AN ALLEGORY,Which pale death did late eclipse;
24684,AN ALLEGORY,"Music framed for infants' glee,"
24685,AN ALLEGORY,Whistle never tuned for thee;
24686,AN ALLEGORY,"Though thou want'st not, thou shalt have them,"
24687,AN ALLEGORY,Loving hearts were they which gave them.
24688,AN ALLEGORY,"Let not one be missing; nurse,"
24689,AN ALLEGORY,See them laid upon the hearse
24690,AN ALLEGORY,Of infant slain by doom perverse.

24692,AN ALLEGORY,"Pictured trophies to their grave,"

24712,AN ALLEGORY,
24713,AN ALLEGORY,The spirits of your fathers

24753,AN ALLEGORY,When to battle fierce came forth
24754,AN ALLEGORY,"All the might of Denmark's crown,"

24761,AN ALLEGORY,Like leviathans afloat
24762,AN ALLEGORY,"Lay their bulwarks on the brine,"

24785,AN ALLEGORY,Their shots along the deep slowly boom:--
24786,AN ALLEGORY,"Then ceased--and all is wail,"
24787,AN ALLEGORY,"As they strike the shatter'd sail,"

25196,AN ALLEGORY,

25198,AN ALLEGORY,What well might seem an elfin's grave;

25200,AN ALLEGORY,That erst thy false affection gave.
25201,AN ALLEGORY,
25202,AN ALLEGORY,I press'd them down the sod beneath;
25203,AN ALLEGORY,I placed one mossy stone above;
25204,AN ALLEGORY,And twined the rose's fading wreath
25205,AN ALLEGORY,Around the sepulchre of love.
25206,AN ALLEGORY,

25250,AN ALLEGORY,"And shut mine eyes, and steal my breath;"

25294,AN ALLEGORY,"To sever for years,"
25295,AN ALLEGORY,"Pale grew thy cheek and cold,"
25296,AN ALLEGORY,Colder thy kiss;
25297,AN ALLEGORY,Truly that hour foretold

25299,AN ALLEGORY,
25300,AN ALLEGORY,The dew of the morning
25301,AN ALLEGORY,Sunk chill on my brow--

25303,AN ALLEGORY,Of what I feel now.

25305,AN ALLEGORY,And light is thy fame:

25333,AN ALLEGORY,With a magic like thee;
25334,AN ALLEGORY,And like music on the waters
25335,AN ALLEGORY,Is thy sweet voice to me:

25337,AN ALLEGORY,"The charmed ocean's pausing,"
25338,AN ALLEGORY,"The waves lie still and gleaming,"

25342,AN ALLEGORY,Her bright chain o'er the deep;
25343,AN ALLEGORY,"Whose breast is gently heaving,"
25344,AN ALLEGORY,As an infant's asleep:
25345,AN ALLEGORY,"So the spirit bows before thee,"

25427,AN ALLEGORY,
25428,AN ALLEGORY,"And where are they? and where art thou,"

25430,AN ALLEGORY,The heroic lay is tuneless now--
25431,AN ALLEGORY,The heroic bosom beats no more!
25432,AN ALLEGORY,"And must thy lyre, so long divine,"

25450,AN ALLEGORY,Ah! no;--the voices of the dead
25451,AN ALLEGORY,"Sound like a distant torrent's fall,"

25469,AN ALLEGORY,
25470,AN ALLEGORY,Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
25471,AN ALLEGORY,We will not think of themes like these!
25472,AN ALLEGORY,It made Anacreon's song divine:
25473,AN ALLEGORY,He served--but served Polycrates--
25474,AN ALLEGORY,A tyrant; but our masters then

25476,AN ALLEGORY,
25477,AN ALLEGORY,The tyrant of the Chersonese
25478,AN ALLEGORY,Was freedom's best and bravest friend;

25480,AN ALLEGORY,O that the present hour would lend
25481,AN ALLEGORY,Another despot of the kind!
25482,AN ALLEGORY,Such chains as his were sure to bind.
25483,AN ALLEGORY,
25484,AN ALLEGORY,Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
25485,AN ALLEGORY,"On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,"
25486,AN ALLEGORY,Exists the remnant of a line
25487,AN ALLEGORY,Such as the Doric mothers bore;

25490,AN ALLEGORY,
25491,AN ALLEGORY,Trust not for freedom to the Franks--

25496,AN ALLEGORY,"Would break your shield, however broad."
25497,AN ALLEGORY,
25498,AN ALLEGORY,Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
25499,AN ALLEGORY,Our virgins dance beneath the shade--
25500,AN ALLEGORY,I see their glorious black eyes shine;
25501,AN ALLEGORY,"But gazing on each glowing maid,"
25502,AN ALLEGORY,"My own the burning tear-drop laves,"
25503,AN ALLEGORY,To think such breasts must suckle slaves.

25536,AN ALLEGORY,
25537,AN ALLEGORY,"NOT a drum was heard, not a funeral note,"
25538,AN ALLEGORY,As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
25539,AN ALLEGORY,Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
25540,AN ALLEGORY,O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
25541,AN ALLEGORY,
25542,AN ALLEGORY,"We buried him darkly at dead of night,"
25543,AN ALLEGORY,"The sods with our bayonets turning,"
25544,AN ALLEGORY,By the struggling moonbeam's misty light

25546,AN ALLEGORY,
25547,AN ALLEGORY,"No useless coffin enclosed his breast,"
25548,AN ALLEGORY,Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;
25549,AN ALLEGORY,But he lay like a warrior taking his rest

25551,AN ALLEGORY,
25552,AN ALLEGORY,"Few and short were the prayers we said,"
25553,AN ALLEGORY,And we spoke not a word of sorrow;

25556,AN ALLEGORY,
25557,AN ALLEGORY,"We thought, as we hollow'd his narrow bed"
25558,AN ALLEGORY,"And smooth'd down his lonely pillow,"
25559,AN ALLEGORY,"That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,"

25561,AN ALLEGORY,
25562,AN ALLEGORY,"Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that 's gone,"

25565,AN ALLEGORY,In the grave where a Briton has laid him.
25566,AN ALLEGORY,
25567,AN ALLEGORY,But half of our heavy task was done
25568,AN ALLEGORY,When the clock struck the hour for retiring;

25580,AN ALLEGORY,604. To Mary
25581,AN ALLEGORY,
25582,AN ALLEGORY,"IF I had thought thou couldst have died,"
25583,AN ALLEGORY,I might not weep for thee;
25584,AN ALLEGORY,"But I forgot, when by thy side,"
25585,AN ALLEGORY,That thou couldst mortal be:
25586,AN ALLEGORY,It never through my mind had past
25587,AN ALLEGORY,"The time would e'er be o'er,"
25588,AN ALLEGORY,"And I on thee should look my last,"
25589,AN ALLEGORY,And thou shouldst smile no more!
25590,AN ALLEGORY,
25591,AN ALLEGORY,"And still upon that face I look,"
25592,AN ALLEGORY,And think 'twill smile again;
25593,AN ALLEGORY,"And still the thought I will not brook,"
25594,AN ALLEGORY,That I must look in vain.
25595,AN ALLEGORY,But when I speak--thou dost not say
25596,AN ALLEGORY,What thou ne'er left'st unsaid;
25597,AN ALLEGORY,"And now I feel, as well I may,"
25598,AN ALLEGORY,"Sweet Mary, thou art dead!"
25599,AN ALLEGORY,
25600,AN ALLEGORY,"If thou wouldst stay, e'en as thou art,"
25601,AN ALLEGORY,All cold and all serene--
25602,AN ALLEGORY,"I still might press thy silent heart,"
25603,AN ALLEGORY,And where thy smiles have been.
25604,AN ALLEGORY,"While e'en thy chill, bleak corse I have,"
25605,AN ALLEGORY,Thou seemest still mine own;
25606,AN ALLEGORY,"But there--I lay thee in thy grave,"
25607,AN ALLEGORY,And I am now alone!
25608,AN ALLEGORY,
25609,AN ALLEGORY,"I do not think, where'er thou art,"
25610,AN ALLEGORY,Thou hast forgotten me;
25611,AN ALLEGORY,"And I, perhaps, may soothe this heart"
25612,AN ALLEGORY,In thinking too of thee:
25613,AN ALLEGORY,Yet there was round thee such a dawn
25614,AN ALLEGORY,"Of light ne'er seen before,"
25615,AN ALLEGORY,"As fancy never could have drawn,"
25616,AN ALLEGORY,And never can restore!

25622,AN ALLEGORY,
25623,AN ALLEGORY,FROM the forests and highlands
25624,AN ALLEGORY,"We come, we come;"
25625,AN ALLEGORY,"From the river-girt islands,"
25626,AN ALLEGORY,"Where loud waves are dumb,"
25627,AN ALLEGORY,Listening to my sweet pipings.
25628,AN ALLEGORY,"The wind in the reeds and the rushes,"
25629,AN ALLEGORY,"The bees on the bells of thyme,"
25630,AN ALLEGORY,"The birds on the myrtle bushes,"
25631,AN ALLEGORY,"The cicale above in the lime,"
25632,AN ALLEGORY,"And the lizards below in the grass,"
25633,AN ALLEGORY,"Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was,"
25634,AN ALLEGORY,Listening to my sweet pipings.
25635,AN ALLEGORY,
25636,AN ALLEGORY,"Liquid Peneus was flowing,"
25637,AN ALLEGORY,And all dark Tempe lay
25638,AN ALLEGORY,"In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing"
25639,AN ALLEGORY,"The light of the dying day,"
25640,AN ALLEGORY,Speeded by my sweet pipings.
25641,AN ALLEGORY,"The Sileni and Sylvans and Fauns,"
25642,AN ALLEGORY,"And the Nymphs of the woods and waves,"
25643,AN ALLEGORY,"To the edge of the moist river-lawns,"
25644,AN ALLEGORY,"And the brink of the dewy caves,"
25645,AN ALLEGORY,"And all that did then attend and follow,"
25646,AN ALLEGORY,"Were silent with love, as you now, Apollo,"
25647,AN ALLEGORY,With envy of my sweet pipings.
25648,AN ALLEGORY,
25649,AN ALLEGORY,"I sang of the dancing stars,"
25650,AN ALLEGORY,"I sang of the daedal earth,"
25651,AN ALLEGORY,"And of heaven, and the giant wars,"
25652,AN ALLEGORY,"And love, and death, and birth."
25653,AN ALLEGORY,And then I changed my pipings--
25654,AN ALLEGORY,Singing how down the vale of Maenalus
25655,AN ALLEGORY,"I pursued a maiden, and clasp'd a reed:"
25656,AN ALLEGORY,"Gods and men, we are all deluded thus!"
25657,AN ALLEGORY,"It breaks in our bosom, and then we bleed."
25658,AN ALLEGORY,"All wept--as I think both ye now would,"
25659,AN ALLEGORY,If envy or age had not frozen your blood--
25660,AN ALLEGORY,At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.

25666,AN ALLEGORY,
25667,AN ALLEGORY,"BEST and brightest, come away!"
25668,AN ALLEGORY,"Fairer far than this fair Day,"
25669,AN ALLEGORY,"Which, like thee to those in sorrow,"
25670,AN ALLEGORY,Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow
25671,AN ALLEGORY,To the rough Year just awake
25672,AN ALLEGORY,In its cradle on the brake.
25673,AN ALLEGORY,"The brightest hour of unborn Spring,"
25674,AN ALLEGORY,"Through the winter wandering,"
25675,AN ALLEGORY,"Found, it seems, the halcyon Morn"
25676,AN ALLEGORY,To hoar February born.
25677,AN ALLEGORY,"Bending from heaven, in azure mirth,"
25678,AN ALLEGORY,It kiss'd the forehead of the Earth;
25679,AN ALLEGORY,And smiled upon the silent sea;
25680,AN ALLEGORY,And bade the frozen streams be free;
25681,AN ALLEGORY,And waked to music all their fountains;
25682,AN ALLEGORY,And breathed upon the frozen mountains;
25683,AN ALLEGORY,And like a prophetess of May
25684,AN ALLEGORY,"Strew'd flowers upon the barren way,"
25685,AN ALLEGORY,Making the wintry world appear
25686,AN ALLEGORY,"Like one on whom thou smilest, dear."
25687,AN ALLEGORY,
25688,AN ALLEGORY,"Away, away, from men and towns,"
25689,AN ALLEGORY,To the wild wood and the downs--
25690,AN ALLEGORY,To the silent wilderness
25691,AN ALLEGORY,Where the soul need not repress
25692,AN ALLEGORY,Its music lest it should not find
25693,AN ALLEGORY,"An echo in another's mind,"
25694,AN ALLEGORY,While the touch of Nature's art
25695,AN ALLEGORY,Harmonizes heart to heart.
25696,AN ALLEGORY,I leave this notice on my door
25697,AN ALLEGORY,For each accustom'd visitor:--
25698,AN ALLEGORY,'I am gone into the fields
25699,AN ALLEGORY,To take what this sweet hour yields.
25700,AN ALLEGORY,"Reflection, you may come to-morrow;"
25701,AN ALLEGORY,Sit by the fireside with Sorrow.
25702,AN ALLEGORY,"You with the unpaid bill, Despair,--"
25703,AN ALLEGORY,"You, tiresome verse-reciter, Care,--"
25704,AN ALLEGORY,"I will pay you in the grave,--"
25705,AN ALLEGORY,Death will listen to your stave.
25706,AN ALLEGORY,"Expectation too, be off!"
25707,AN ALLEGORY,To-day is for itself enough.
25708,AN ALLEGORY,"Hope, in pity mock not Woe"
25709,AN ALLEGORY,"With smiles, nor follow where I go;"
25710,AN ALLEGORY,"Long having lived on your sweet food,"
25711,AN ALLEGORY,At length I find one moment's good
25712,AN ALLEGORY,"After long pain: with all your love,"
25713,AN ALLEGORY,This you never told me of.'
25714,AN ALLEGORY,
25715,AN ALLEGORY,"Radiant Sister of the Day,"
25716,AN ALLEGORY,Awake! arise! and come away!
25717,AN ALLEGORY,To the wild woods and the plains;
25718,AN ALLEGORY,And the pools where winter rains
25719,AN ALLEGORY,Image all their roof of leaves;
25720,AN ALLEGORY,Where the pine its garland weaves
25721,AN ALLEGORY,Of sapless green and ivy dun
25722,AN ALLEGORY,Round stems that never kiss the sun;
25723,AN ALLEGORY,"Where the lawns and pastures be,"
25724,AN ALLEGORY,And the sandhills of the sea;
25725,AN ALLEGORY,Where the melting hoar-frost wets
25726,AN ALLEGORY,"The daisy-star that never sets,"
25727,AN ALLEGORY,"And wind-flowers, and violets"
25728,AN ALLEGORY,"Which yet join not scent to hue,"
25729,AN ALLEGORY,Crown the pale year weak and new;
25730,AN ALLEGORY,When the night is left behind
25731,AN ALLEGORY,"In the deep east, dun and blind,"
25732,AN ALLEGORY,"And the blue noon is over us,"
25733,AN ALLEGORY,And the multitudinous
25734,AN ALLEGORY,Billows murmur at our feet
25735,AN ALLEGORY,"Where the earth and ocean meet,"
25736,AN ALLEGORY,And all things seem only one
25737,AN ALLEGORY,In the universal sun.

25743,AN ALLEGORY,
25744,AN ALLEGORY,"THE world's great age begins anew,"
25745,AN ALLEGORY,"The golden years return,"
25746,AN ALLEGORY,The earth doth like a snake renew
25747,AN ALLEGORY,Her winter weeds outworn;
25748,AN ALLEGORY,"Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam"
25749,AN ALLEGORY,Like wrecks of a dissolving dream.
25750,AN ALLEGORY,
25751,AN ALLEGORY,A brighter Hellas rears its mountains
25752,AN ALLEGORY,From waves serener far;
25753,AN ALLEGORY,A new Peneus rolls his fountains
25754,AN ALLEGORY,Against the morning star;
25755,AN ALLEGORY,"Where fairer Tempes bloom, there sleep"
25756,AN ALLEGORY,Young Cyclads on a sunnier deep.
25757,AN ALLEGORY,
25758,AN ALLEGORY,"A loftier Argo cleaves the main,"
25759,AN ALLEGORY,Fraught with a later prize;
25760,AN ALLEGORY,"Another Orpheus sings again,"
25761,AN ALLEGORY,"And loves, and weeps, and dies;"
25762,AN ALLEGORY,A new Ulysses leaves once more
25763,AN ALLEGORY,Calypso for his native shore.
25764,AN ALLEGORY,
25765,AN ALLEGORY,"O write no more the tale of Troy,"
25766,AN ALLEGORY,If earth Death's scroll must be--
25767,AN ALLEGORY,Nor mix with Laian rage the joy
25768,AN ALLEGORY,"Which dawns upon the free,"
25769,AN ALLEGORY,Although a subtler Sphinx renew
25770,AN ALLEGORY,Riddles of death Thebes never knew.
25771,AN ALLEGORY,

25777,AN ALLEGORY,All earth can take or Heaven can give.
25778,AN ALLEGORY,
25779,AN ALLEGORY,Saturn and Love their long repose
25780,AN ALLEGORY,"Shall burst, more bright and good"
25781,AN ALLEGORY,"Than all who fell, than One who rose,"
25782,AN ALLEGORY,Than many unsubdued:
25783,AN ALLEGORY,"Not gold, not blood, their altar dowers,"
25784,AN ALLEGORY,But votive tears and symbol flowers.
25785,AN ALLEGORY,
25786,AN ALLEGORY,O cease! must hate and death return?
25787,AN ALLEGORY,Cease! must men kill and die?
25788,AN ALLEGORY,Cease! drain not to its dregs the urn
25789,AN ALLEGORY,Of bitter prophecy!
25790,AN ALLEGORY,The world is weary of the past--
25791,AN ALLEGORY,O might it die or rest at last!

25797,AN ALLEGORY,
25798,AN ALLEGORY,"HAIL to thee, blithe spirit!"
25799,AN ALLEGORY,Bird thou never wert--
25800,AN ALLEGORY,That from heaven or near it
25801,AN ALLEGORY,Pourest thy full heart
25802,AN ALLEGORY,In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
25803,AN ALLEGORY,
25804,AN ALLEGORY,Higher still and higher
25805,AN ALLEGORY,"From the earth thou springest,"
25806,AN ALLEGORY,Like a cloud of fire;
25807,AN ALLEGORY,"The blue deep thou wingest,"
25808,AN ALLEGORY,"And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest."

25810,AN ALLEGORY,In the golden light'ning
25811,AN ALLEGORY,"Of the sunken sun,"
25812,AN ALLEGORY,"O'er which clouds are bright'ning,"
25813,AN ALLEGORY,"Thou dost float and run,"
25814,AN ALLEGORY,Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
25815,AN ALLEGORY,
25816,AN ALLEGORY,The pale purple even
25817,AN ALLEGORY,Melts around thy flight;
25818,AN ALLEGORY,"Like a star of heaven,"
25819,AN ALLEGORY,In the broad daylight
25820,AN ALLEGORY,"Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight--"
25821,AN ALLEGORY,
25822,AN ALLEGORY,Keen as are the arrows
25823,AN ALLEGORY,Of that silver sphere
25824,AN ALLEGORY,Whose intense lamp narrows
25825,AN ALLEGORY,"In the white dawn clear,"
25826,AN ALLEGORY,"Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there."
25827,AN ALLEGORY,
25828,AN ALLEGORY,All the earth and air
25829,AN ALLEGORY,"With thy voice is loud,"
25830,AN ALLEGORY,"As when night is bare,"
25831,AN ALLEGORY,From one lonely cloud
25832,AN ALLEGORY,"The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow'd."
25833,AN ALLEGORY,
25834,AN ALLEGORY,What thou art we know not;
25835,AN ALLEGORY,What is most like thee?
25836,AN ALLEGORY,From rainbow clouds there flow not
25837,AN ALLEGORY,"Drops so bright to see,"
25838,AN ALLEGORY,As from thy presence showers a rain of melody:--
25839,AN ALLEGORY,
25840,AN ALLEGORY,Like a poet hidden
25841,AN ALLEGORY,"In the light of thought,"
25842,AN ALLEGORY,"Singing hymns unbidden,"
25843,AN ALLEGORY,Till the world is wrought
25844,AN ALLEGORY,To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
25845,AN ALLEGORY,
25846,AN ALLEGORY,Like a high-born maiden
25847,AN ALLEGORY,"In a palace tower,"
25848,AN ALLEGORY,Soothing her love-laden
25849,AN ALLEGORY,Soul in secret hour
25850,AN ALLEGORY,"With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:"
25851,AN ALLEGORY,
25852,AN ALLEGORY,Like a glow-worm golden
25853,AN ALLEGORY,"In a dell of dew,"
25854,AN ALLEGORY,Scattering unbeholden
25855,AN ALLEGORY,Its aerial hue
25856,AN ALLEGORY,Among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view:
25857,AN ALLEGORY,
25858,AN ALLEGORY,Like a rose embower'd
25859,AN ALLEGORY,"In its own green leaves,"
25860,AN ALLEGORY,"By warm winds deflower'd,"
25861,AN ALLEGORY,Till the scent it gives
25862,AN ALLEGORY,Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves.
25863,AN ALLEGORY,
25864,AN ALLEGORY,Sound of vernal showers
25865,AN ALLEGORY,"On the twinkling grass,"
25866,AN ALLEGORY,Rain-awaken'd flowers--
25867,AN ALLEGORY,All that ever was
25868,AN ALLEGORY,Joyous and clear and fresh--thy music doth surpass.
25869,AN ALLEGORY,
25870,AN ALLEGORY,"Teach us, sprite or bird,"
25871,AN ALLEGORY,What sweet thoughts are thine:
25872,AN ALLEGORY,I have never heard
25873,AN ALLEGORY,Praise of love or wine
25874,AN ALLEGORY,That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
25875,AN ALLEGORY,
25876,AN ALLEGORY,"Chorus hymeneal,"
25877,AN ALLEGORY,"Or triumphal chant,"
25878,AN ALLEGORY,Match'd with thine would be all
25879,AN ALLEGORY,But an empty vaunt--
25880,AN ALLEGORY,A thin wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
25881,AN ALLEGORY,
25882,AN ALLEGORY,What objects are the fountains
25883,AN ALLEGORY,Of thy happy strain?
25884,AN ALLEGORY,"What fields, or waves, or mountains?"
25885,AN ALLEGORY,What shapes of sky or plain?
25886,AN ALLEGORY,What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
25887,AN ALLEGORY,
25888,AN ALLEGORY,With thy clear keen joyance
25889,AN ALLEGORY,Languor cannot be:
25890,AN ALLEGORY,Shadow of annoyance
25891,AN ALLEGORY,Never came near thee:
25892,AN ALLEGORY,"Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety."
25893,AN ALLEGORY,
25894,AN ALLEGORY,"Waking or asleep,"
25895,AN ALLEGORY,Thou of death must deem
25896,AN ALLEGORY,Things more true and deep
25897,AN ALLEGORY,"Than we mortals dream,"
25898,AN ALLEGORY,Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
25899,AN ALLEGORY,
25900,AN ALLEGORY,"We look before and after,"
25901,AN ALLEGORY,And pine for what is not:
25902,AN ALLEGORY,Our sincerest laughter
25903,AN ALLEGORY,With some pain is fraught;
25904,AN ALLEGORY,Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
25905,AN ALLEGORY,
25906,AN ALLEGORY,"Yet, if we could scorn"
25907,AN ALLEGORY,"Hate and pride and fear,"
25908,AN ALLEGORY,If we were things born
25909,AN ALLEGORY,"Not to shed a tear,"
25910,AN ALLEGORY,I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
25911,AN ALLEGORY,
25912,AN ALLEGORY,Better than all measures
25913,AN ALLEGORY,"Of delightful sound,"
25914,AN ALLEGORY,Better than all treasures
25915,AN ALLEGORY,"That in books are found,"
25916,AN ALLEGORY,"Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!"
25917,AN ALLEGORY,
25918,AN ALLEGORY,Teach me half the gladness
25919,AN ALLEGORY,That thy brain must know;
25920,AN ALLEGORY,Such harmonious madness
25921,AN ALLEGORY,"From my lips would flow,"
25922,AN ALLEGORY,"The world should listen then, as I am listening now."

26227,AN IMITATION,"I DREAM'D that, as I wander'd by the way,"
26228,AN IMITATION,Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring;
26229,AN IMITATION,"And gentle odours led my steps astray,"
26230,AN IMITATION,Mix'd with a sound of waters murmuring
26231,AN IMITATION,"Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay"
26232,AN IMITATION,"Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling"
26233,AN IMITATION,"Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,"
26234,AN IMITATION,"But kiss'd it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream."
26235,AN IMITATION,
26236,AN IMITATION,There grew pied wind-flowers and violets;
26237,AN IMITATION,"Daisies, those pearl'd Arcturi of the earth,"
26238,AN IMITATION,The constellated flower that never sets;
26239,AN IMITATION,"Faint oxlips; tender bluebells, at whose birth"
26240,AN IMITATION,The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets--
26241,AN IMITATION,"Like a child, half in tenderness and mirth--"
26242,AN IMITATION,Its mother's face with heaven-collected tears
26243,AN IMITATION,"When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears."

26247,AN IMITATION,"And cherry-blossoms, and white cups whose wine"
26248,AN IMITATION,Was the bright dew yet drain'd not by the day;
26249,AN IMITATION,"And wild roses, and ivy serpentine,"
26250,AN IMITATION,With its dark buds and leaves wandering astray;
26251,AN IMITATION,"And flowers, azure, black, and streak'd with gold,"
26252,AN IMITATION,Fairer than any waken'd eyes behold.
26253,AN IMITATION,
26254,AN IMITATION,And nearer to the river's trembling edge
26255,AN IMITATION,"There grew broad flag-flowers, purple prank'd with white,"
26256,AN IMITATION,"And starry river-buds among the sedge,"

26437,AN IMITATION,"I AM! yet what I am who cares, or knows?"
26438,AN IMITATION,My friends forsake me like a memory lost.
26439,AN IMITATION,I am the self-consumer of my woes;
26440,AN IMITATION,"They rise and vanish, an oblivious host,"
26441,AN IMITATION,"Shadows of life, whose very soul is lost."

26443,AN IMITATION,
26444,AN IMITATION,"Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,"
26445,AN IMITATION,"Into the living sea of waking dream,"
26446,AN IMITATION,"Where there is neither sense of life, nor joys,"
26447,AN IMITATION,But the huge shipwreck of my own esteem
26448,AN IMITATION,And all that 's dear. Even those I loved the best
26449,AN IMITATION,"Are strange--nay, they are stranger than the rest."
26450,AN IMITATION,
26451,AN IMITATION,I long for scenes where man has never trod--
26452,AN IMITATION,For scenes where woman never smiled or wept--
26453,AN IMITATION,"There to abide with my Creator, God,"
26454,AN IMITATION,"And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept,"

26480,O SORROW!,Why dost borrow
26481,O SORROW!,"The natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?--"
26482,O SORROW!,To give maiden blushes
26483,O SORROW!,To the white rose bushes?
26484,O SORROW!,Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?
26485,O SORROW!,
26486,O SORROW!,O Sorrow!
26487,O SORROW!,Why dost borrow
26488,O SORROW!,The lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?--
26489,O SORROW!,To give the glow-worm light?
26490,O SORROW!,"Or, on a moonless night,"
26491,O SORROW!,"To tinge, on siren shores, the salt sea-spry?"
26492,O SORROW!,

26499,O SORROW!,
26500,O SORROW!,O Sorrow!
26501,O SORROW!,Why dost borrow
26502,O SORROW!,Heart's lightness from the merriment of May?--
26503,O SORROW!,A lover would not tread
26504,O SORROW!,"A cowslip on the head,"
26505,O SORROW!,Though he should dance from eve till peep of day--
26506,O SORROW!,Nor any drooping flower
26507,O SORROW!,"Held sacred for thy bower,"
26508,O SORROW!,Wherever he may sport himself and play.
26509,O SORROW!,
26510,O SORROW!,To Sorrow
26511,O SORROW!,"I bade good morrow,"
26512,O SORROW!,And thought to leave her far away behind;
26513,O SORROW!,"But cheerly, cheerly,"
26514,O SORROW!,She loves me dearly;
26515,O SORROW!,"She is so constant to me, and so kind:"
26516,O SORROW!,I would deceive her
26517,O SORROW!,"And so leave her,"
26518,O SORROW!,But ah! she is so constant and so kind.
26519,O SORROW!,
26520,O SORROW!,"Beneath my palm-trees, by the river side,"
26521,O SORROW!,I sat a-weeping: in the whole world wide
26522,O SORROW!,"There was no one to ask me why I wept,--"
26523,O SORROW!,And so I kept
26524,O SORROW!,Brimming the water-lily cups with tears
26525,O SORROW!,Cold as my fears.
26526,O SORROW!,
26527,O SORROW!,"Beneath my palm-trees, by the river side,"
26528,O SORROW!,"I sat a-weeping: what enamour'd bride,"
26529,O SORROW!,"Cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,"
26530,O SORROW!,But hides and shrouds
26531,O SORROW!,Beneath dark palm-trees by a river side?
26532,O SORROW!,
26533,O SORROW!,"And as I sat, over the light blue hills"
26534,O SORROW!,There came a noise of revellers: the rills
26535,O SORROW!,Into the wide stream came of purple hue--
26536,O SORROW!,'Twas Bacchus and his crew!
26537,O SORROW!,"The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills"
26538,O SORROW!,From kissing cymbals made a merry din--
26539,O SORROW!,'Twas Bacchus and his kin!
26540,O SORROW!,"Like to a moving vintage down they came,"
26541,O SORROW!,"Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;"
26542,O SORROW!,"All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,"
26543,O SORROW!,"To scare thee, Melancholy!"
26544,O SORROW!,"O then, O then, thou wast a simple name!"
26545,O SORROW!,"And I forgot thee, as the berried holly"
26546,O SORROW!,"By shepherds is forgotten, when in June"
26547,O SORROW!,Tall chestnuts keep away the sun and moon:--
26548,O SORROW!,I rush'd into the folly!
26549,O SORROW!,
26550,O SORROW!,"Within his car, aloft, young Bacchus stood,"
26551,O SORROW!,"Trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,"
26552,O SORROW!,With sidelong laughing;
26553,O SORROW!,And little rills of crimson wine imbrued
26554,O SORROW!,"His plump white arms and shoulders, enough white"
26555,O SORROW!,For Venus' pearly bite;
26556,O SORROW!,"And near him rode Silenus on his ass,"
26557,O SORROW!,Pelted with flowers as he on did pass
26558,O SORROW!,Tipsily quaffing.
26559,O SORROW!,
26560,O SORROW!,"'Whence came ye, merry Damsels! whence came ye,"
26561,O SORROW!,"So many, and so many, and such glee?"
26562,O SORROW!,"Why have ye left your bowers desolate,"
26563,O SORROW!,"Your lutes, and gentler fate?'--"
26564,O SORROW!,"'We follow Bacchus! Bacchus on the wing,"
26565,O SORROW!,A-conquering!
26566,O SORROW!,"Bacchus, young Bacchus! good or ill betide,"
26567,O SORROW!,We dance before him thorough kingdoms wide:--
26568,O SORROW!,"Come hither, lady fair, and joined be"
26569,O SORROW!,To our wild minstrelsy!'
26570,O SORROW!,
26571,O SORROW!,"'Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs! whence came ye,"
26572,O SORROW!,"So many, and so many, and such glee?"
26573,O SORROW!,"Why have ye left your forest haunts, why left"
26574,O SORROW!,Your nuts in oak-tree cleft?'--
26575,O SORROW!,"'For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;"
26576,O SORROW!,"For wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,"
26577,O SORROW!,And cold mushrooms;
26578,O SORROW!,For wine we follow Bacchus through the earth;
26579,O SORROW!,Great god of breathless cups and chirping mirth!
26580,O SORROW!,"Come hither, lady fair, and joined be"
26581,O SORROW!,To our mad minstrelsy!'
26582,O SORROW!,
26583,O SORROW!,"Over wide streams and mountains great we went,"
26584,O SORROW!,"And, save when Bacchus kept his ivy tent,"
26585,O SORROW!,"Onward the tiger and the leopard pants,"
26586,O SORROW!,With Asian elephants:
26587,O SORROW!,"Onward these myriads--with song and dance,"
26588,O SORROW!,"With zebras striped, and sleek Arabians' prance,"
26589,O SORROW!,"Web-footed alligators, crocodiles,"
26590,O SORROW!,"Bearing upon their scaly backs, in files,"
26591,O SORROW!,Plump infant laughers mimicking the coil
26592,O SORROW!,"Of seamen, and stout galley-rowers' toil:"
26593,O SORROW!,"With toying oars and silken sails they glide,"
26594,O SORROW!,Nor care for wind and tide.
26595,O SORROW!,
26596,O SORROW!,"Mounted on panthers' furs and lions' manes,"
26597,O SORROW!,From rear to van they scour about the plains;
26598,O SORROW!,A three days' journey in a moment done;
26599,O SORROW!,"And always, at the rising of the sun,"
26600,O SORROW!,"About the wilds they hunt with spear and horn,"
26601,O SORROW!,On spleenful unicorn.
26602,O SORROW!,
26603,O SORROW!,I saw Osirian Egypt kneel adown
26604,O SORROW!,Before the vine-wreath crown!
26605,O SORROW!,I saw parch'd Abyssinia rouse and sing
26606,O SORROW!,To the silver cymbals' ring!
26607,O SORROW!,I saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce
26608,O SORROW!,Old Tartary the fierce!
26609,O SORROW!,"The kings of Ind their jewel-sceptres vail,"
26610,O SORROW!,And from their treasures scatter pearled hail;
26611,O SORROW!,"Great Brahma from his mystic heaven groans,"
26612,O SORROW!,"And all his priesthood moans,"
26613,O SORROW!,Before young Bacchus' eye-wink turning pale.
26614,O SORROW!,"Into these regions came I, following him,"
26615,O SORROW!,"Sick-hearted, weary--so I took a whim"
26616,O SORROW!,"To stray away into these forests drear,"
26617,O SORROW!,"Alone, without a peer:"
26618,O SORROW!,And I have told thee all thou mayest hear.
26619,O SORROW!,
26620,O SORROW!,Young Stranger!
26621,O SORROW!,I've been a ranger

26623,O SORROW!,Alas! 'tis not for me!
26624,O SORROW!,"Bewitch'd I sure must be,"
26625,O SORROW!,To lose in grieving all my maiden prime.
26626,O SORROW!,
26627,O SORROW!,"Come then, Sorrow,"
26628,O SORROW!,Sweetest Sorrow!
26629,O SORROW!,Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast:
26630,O SORROW!,"I thought to leave thee,"
26631,O SORROW!,"And deceive thee,"
26632,O SORROW!,But now of all the world I love thee best.
26633,O SORROW!,
26634,O SORROW!,"There is not one,"
26635,O SORROW!,"No, no, not one"
26636,O SORROW!,But thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;
26637,O SORROW!,"Thou art her mother,"

26651,O SORROW!,"One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:"
26652,O SORROW!,"'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,"
26653,O SORROW!,"But being too happy in thine happiness,"

26666,O SORROW!,And purple-stained mouth;
26667,O SORROW!,"That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,"

26675,O SORROW!,"Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;"
26676,O SORROW!,Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
26677,O SORROW!,And leaden-eyed despairs;

26679,O SORROW!,Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.

26714,O SORROW!,"Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!"
26715,O SORROW!,No hungry generations tread thee down;
26716,O SORROW!,The voice I hear this passing night was heard
26717,O SORROW!,In ancient days by emperor and clown:

26730,O SORROW!,"Past the near meadows, over the still stream,"
26731,O SORROW!,Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
26732,O SORROW!,In the next valley-glades:

26800,O SORROW!,
26801,O SORROW!,"O GODDESS! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung"
26802,O SORROW!,"By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,"
26803,O SORROW!,And pardon that thy secrets should be sung
26804,O SORROW!,Even into thine own soft-conched ear:
26805,O SORROW!,"Surely I dream'd to-day, or did I see"
26806,O SORROW!,The winged Psyche with awaken'd eyes?
26807,O SORROW!,"I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly,"
26808,O SORROW!,"And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,"
26809,O SORROW!,"Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side"
26810,O SORROW!,"In deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof"
26811,O SORROW!,"Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran"
26812,O SORROW!,"A brooklet, scarce espied:"
26813,O SORROW!,"'Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,"
26814,O SORROW!,"Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian"
26815,O SORROW!,They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass;
26816,O SORROW!,"Their arms embraced, and their pinions too;"
26817,O SORROW!,"Their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu,"
26818,O SORROW!,"As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber,"
26819,O SORROW!,And ready still past kisses to outnumber
26820,O SORROW!,At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love:
26821,O SORROW!,The winged boy I knew;
26822,O SORROW!,"But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove?"
26823,O SORROW!,His Psyche true!
26824,O SORROW!,
26825,O SORROW!,O latest-born and loveliest vision far
26826,O SORROW!,Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy!
26827,O SORROW!,"Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-region'd star,"
26828,O SORROW!,"Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;"
26829,O SORROW!,"Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,"
26830,O SORROW!,Nor altar heap'd with flowers;
26831,O SORROW!,Nor Virgin-choir to make delicious moan
26832,O SORROW!,Upon the midnight hours;
26833,O SORROW!,"No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet"
26834,O SORROW!,From chain-swung censer teeming;
26835,O SORROW!,"No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat"
26836,O SORROW!,Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.
26837,O SORROW!,
26838,O SORROW!,"O brightest! though too late for antique vows,"
26839,O SORROW!,"Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,"
26840,O SORROW!,"When holy were the haunted forest boughs,"
26841,O SORROW!,"Holy the air, the water, and the fire;"
26842,O SORROW!,Yet even in these days so far retired
26843,O SORROW!,"From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,"
26844,O SORROW!,"Fluttering among the faint Olympians,"
26845,O SORROW!,"I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired."
26846,O SORROW!,"So let me be thy choir, and make a moan"
26847,O SORROW!,Upon the midnight hours;
26848,O SORROW!,"Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet"
26849,O SORROW!,From swinged censer teeming:

26851,O SORROW!,Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.
26852,O SORROW!,
26853,O SORROW!,"Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane"

26857,O SORROW!,"Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees"
26858,O SORROW!,Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep;
26859,O SORROW!,"And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,"
26860,O SORROW!,The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep;
26861,O SORROW!,And in the midst of this wide quietness
26862,O SORROW!,A rosy sanctuary will I dress
26863,O SORROW!,"With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain,"
26864,O SORROW!,"With buds, and bells, and stars without a name,"
26865,O SORROW!,"With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign,"
26866,O SORROW!,"Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same;"
26867,O SORROW!,And there shall be for thee all soft delight
26868,O SORROW!,"That shadowy thought can win,"
26869,O SORROW!,"A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,"

26877,O SORROW!,SEASON of mists and mellow fruitfulness!
26878,O SORROW!,Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
26879,O SORROW!,Conspiring with him how to load and bless
26880,O SORROW!,With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
26881,O SORROW!,"To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,"
26882,O SORROW!,And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
26883,O SORROW!,"To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells"
26884,O SORROW!,"With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,"
26885,O SORROW!,"And still more, later flowers for the bees,"
26886,O SORROW!,"Until they think warm days will never cease,"
26887,O SORROW!,For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
26888,O SORROW!,
26889,O SORROW!,Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
26890,O SORROW!,Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
26891,O SORROW!,"Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,"
26892,O SORROW!,Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
26893,O SORROW!,"Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,"
26894,O SORROW!,"Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook"
26895,O SORROW!,Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;
26896,O SORROW!,And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
26897,O SORROW!,Steady thy laden head across a brook;
26898,O SORROW!,"Or by a cider-press, with patient look,"
26899,O SORROW!,Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
26900,O SORROW!,
26901,O SORROW!,"Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?"
26902,O SORROW!,"Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,--"
26903,O SORROW!,"While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,"
26904,O SORROW!,And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
26905,O SORROW!,Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
26906,O SORROW!,"Among the river sallows, borne aloft"
26907,O SORROW!,Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
26908,O SORROW!,And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
26909,O SORROW!,Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
26910,O SORROW!,The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft;
26911,O SORROW!,And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

26919,O SORROW!,"Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;"
26920,O SORROW!,Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kist
26921,O SORROW!,"By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;"
26922,O SORROW!,"Make not your rosary of yew-berries,"
26923,O SORROW!,"Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be"
26924,O SORROW!,"Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl"
26925,O SORROW!,A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
26926,O SORROW!,"For shade to shade will come too drowsily,"
26927,O SORROW!,And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
26928,O SORROW!,
26929,O SORROW!,But when the melancholy fit shall fall
26930,O SORROW!,"Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,"
26931,O SORROW!,"That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,"
26932,O SORROW!,And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
26933,O SORROW!,"Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,"
26934,O SORROW!,"Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,"
26935,O SORROW!,Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
26936,O SORROW!,"Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,"
26937,O SORROW!,"Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,"
26938,O SORROW!,"And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes."
26939,O SORROW!,
26940,O SORROW!,She dwells with Beauty--Beauty that must die;
26941,O SORROW!,"And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips"
26942,O SORROW!,"Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,"
26943,O SORROW!,Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
26944,O SORROW!,"Ay, in the very temple of Delight"
26945,O SORROW!,"Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,"
26946,O SORROW!,Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
26947,O SORROW!,Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
26948,O SORROW!,"His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,"
26949,O SORROW!,And be among her cloudy trophies hung.

26962,O SORROW!,"Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles,"

28936,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,

28965,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"I MIND me in the days departed,"
28966,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,How often underneath the sun
28967,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,With childish bounds I used to run
28968,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,To a garden long deserted.
28969,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
28970,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,The beds and walks were vanish'd quite;

29000,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Some Lady, stately overmuch,"

29014,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29015,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Nor thought that gardener (full of scorns

29017,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"A child would bring it all its praise,"

29022,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Of science or love's compliment,"
29023,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,I ween they smelt as sweet.
29024,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29025,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,It did not move my grief to see
29026,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,The trace of human step departed:
29027,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Because the garden was deserted,"

29029,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29030,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken"

29033,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,We feel the gladness then.
29034,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29035,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And gladdest hours for me did glide
29036,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,In silence at the rose-tree wall:
29037,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,A thrush made gladness musical
29038,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Upon the other side.
29039,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29040,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Nor he nor I did e'er incline

29043,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Lead lives as glad as mine?
29044,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29045,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"To make my hermit-home complete,"
29046,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,I brought clear water from the spring
29047,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Praised in its own low murmuring,"
29048,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And cresses glossy wet.
29049,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29050,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And so, I thought, my likeness grew"
29051,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,(Without the melancholy tale)
29052,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"To 'gentle hermit of the dale,'"
29053,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And Angelina too.
29054,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29055,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,For oft I read within my nook
29056,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
29057,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Made sounds poetic in the trees,"
29058,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And then I shut the book.
29059,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29060,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"If I shut this wherein I write,"
29061,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,I hear no more the wind athwart
29062,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Those trees, nor feel that childish heart"
29063,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Delighting in delight.
29064,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29065,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"My childhood from my life is parted,"
29066,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,My footstep from the moss which drew
29067,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Its fairy circle round: anew
29068,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,The garden is deserted.
29069,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29070,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Another thrush may there rehearse
29071,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,The madrigals which sweetest are;
29072,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,No more for me!--myself afar
29073,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Do sing a sadder verse.
29074,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29075,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Ah me! ah me! when erst I lay
29076,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"In that child's-nest so greenly wrought,"
29077,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"I laugh'd unto myself and thought,"
29078,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,'The time will pass away.'
29079,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29080,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And still I laugh'd, and did not fear"

29082,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"The childish time, some happier play"
29083,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,My womanhood would cheer.
29084,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29085,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,I knew the time would pass away;

29087,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Dear God, how seldom, if at all,"
29088,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Did I look up to pray!
29089,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29090,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,The time is past: and now that grows
29091,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"The cypress high among the trees,"

29094,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29095,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"When wiser, meeker thoughts are given,"

29098,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"The colour draws from heaven,--"
29099,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29100,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"It something saith for earthly pain,"

29103,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,That happy child again.

29121,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Crying 'Where are ye, O my loved and loving?'--"

29137,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Of the absolute Heavens. Deep-hearted man, express"
29138,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Grief for thy Dead in silence like to death--
29139,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Most like a monumental statue set

29157,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years--"
29158,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Those of my own life, who by turns had flung"
29159,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,"
29160,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move"
29161,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;"
29162,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,"
29163,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"'Guess now who holds thee?'--'Death,' I said. But there"
29164,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"The silver answer rang--'Not Death, but Love.'"

29179,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part"

29199,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Without the sense of that which I forbore--
29200,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
29201,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine"

29350,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'"
29351,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,

29354,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And Spanish sailors with bearded lips,"
29355,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the beauty and mystery of the ships,"
29356,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the magic of the sea.
29357,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the voice of that wayward song
29358,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Is singing and saying still:

29375,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,In their graves o'erlooking the tranquil bay
29376,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Where they in battle died.
29377,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the sound of that mournful song

29387,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the verse of that sweet old song,"

29390,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'"
29391,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,

29395,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"That in part are prophecies, and in part"
29396,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Are longings wild and vain.
29397,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the voice of that fitful song
29398,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Sings on, and is never still:"
29399,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"'A boy's will is the wind's will,"
29400,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'"
29401,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29402,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,There are things of which I may not speak;
29403,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,There are dreams that cannot die;

29405,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And bring a pallor into the cheek,"
29406,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And a mist before the eye.
29407,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the words of that fatal song
29408,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Come over me like a chill:
29409,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"'A boy's will is the wind's will,"
29410,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'"
29411,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29412,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Strange to me now are the forms I meet
29413,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,When I visit the dear old town;

29416,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"As they balance up and down,"
29417,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Are singing the beautiful song,"
29418,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Are sighing and whispering still:

29425,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And among the dreams of the days that were
29426,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,I find my lost youth again.
29427,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the strange and beautiful song,"

29469,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"On a bright May mornin' long ago,"
29470,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,When first you were my bride;
29471,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"The corn was springin' fresh and green,"
29472,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the lark sang loud and high--
29473,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And the red was on your lip, Mary,"
29474,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the love-light in your eye.
29475,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,

29482,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And I still keep list'ning for the words

29484,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29485,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"'Tis but a step down yonder lane,"

29492,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,With your baby on your breast.
29493,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29494,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"I'm very lonely now, Mary,"
29495,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"For the poor make no new friends,"

29639,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,

29644,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"That the wind came out of the cloud one night,"

29697,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,The sickness--the nausea--

29708,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,For the naphthaline river

29712,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29713,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"--Of a water that flows,"
29714,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"With a lullaby sound,"

29735,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29736,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"For now, while so quietly"
29737,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Lying, it fancies"
29738,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,A holier odour
29739,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"About it, of pansies--"

29744,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29745,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And so it lies happily,"
29746,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Bathing in many
29747,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,A dream of the truth
29748,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And the beauty of Annie--

29752,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"She tenderly kiss'd me,"
29753,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"She fondly caress'd,"
29754,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And then I fell gently
29755,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,To sleep on her breast--
29756,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Deeply to sleep
29757,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,From the heaven of her breast.
29758,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29759,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"When the light was extinguish'd,"
29760,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"She cover'd me warm,"
29761,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,And she pray'd to the angels
29762,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,To keep me from harm--
29763,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,To the queen of the angels
29764,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,To shield me from harm.
29765,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29766,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"And I lie so composedly,"
29767,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Now, in my bed"
29768,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"(Knowing her love),"
29769,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,That you fancy me dead--

29775,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Thinking me dead.
29776,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,
29777,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,But my heart it is brighter
29778,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,Than all of the many
29779,A LANDSCAPE IN BERKSHIRE,"Stars in the sky,"

30283,PART IV,
30284,PART IV,THERE is sweet music here that softer falls
30285,PART IV,"Than petals from blown roses on the grass,"
30286,PART IV,Or night-dews on still waters between walls
30287,PART IV,"Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;"
30288,PART IV,"Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,"
30289,PART IV,Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes;
30290,PART IV,Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.
30291,PART IV,"Here are cool mosses deep,"
30292,PART IV,"And thro' the moss the ivies creep,"
30293,PART IV,"And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,"
30294,PART IV,And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.

30296,PART IV,"Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness,"
30297,PART IV,"And utterly consumed with sharp distress,"
30298,PART IV,While all things else have rest from weariness?
30299,PART IV,"All things have rest: why should we toil alone,"
30300,PART IV,"We only toil, who are the first of things,"
30301,PART IV,"And make perpetual moan,"
30302,PART IV,Still from one sorrow to another thrown:

30305,PART IV,Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm;
30306,PART IV,"Nor harken what the inner spirit sings,"

30310,PART IV,"Lo! in the middle of the wood,"
30311,PART IV,The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud
30312,PART IV,"With winds upon the branch, and there"
30313,PART IV,"Grows green and broad, and takes no care,"
30314,PART IV,"Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon"
30315,PART IV,Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow
30316,PART IV,"Falls, and floats adown the air."
30317,PART IV,"Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,"

30331,PART IV,Let us alone. What is it that will last?
30332,PART IV,"All things are taken from us, and become"
30333,PART IV,Portions and parcels of the dreadful Past.
30334,PART IV,Let us alone. What pleasure can we have
30335,PART IV,To war with evil? Is there any peace
30336,PART IV,In ever climbing up the climbing wave?
30337,PART IV,"All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave"

30341,PART IV,"How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,"
30342,PART IV,With half-shut eyes ever to seem
30343,PART IV,Falling asleep in a half-dream!

30346,PART IV,To hear each other's whisper'd speech;
30347,PART IV,"Eating the Lotos day by day,"
30348,PART IV,"To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,"
30349,PART IV,And tender curving lines of creamy spray;
30350,PART IV,To lend our hearts and spirits wholly
30351,PART IV,To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
30352,PART IV,"To muse and brood and live again in memory,"
30353,PART IV,With those old faces of our infancy
30354,PART IV,"Heap'd over with a mound of grass,"
30355,PART IV,"Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!"
30356,PART IV,
30357,PART IV,"Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,"
30358,PART IV,And dear the last embraces of our wives
30359,PART IV,And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change;
30360,PART IV,For surely now our household hearts are cold:
30361,PART IV,Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:
30362,PART IV,And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.
30363,PART IV,Or else the island princes over-bold
30364,PART IV,"Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings"
30365,PART IV,"Before them of the ten years' war in Troy,"
30366,PART IV,"And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things."
30367,PART IV,Is there confusion in the little isle?

30369,PART IV,The Gods are hard to reconcile:
30370,PART IV,'Tis hard to settle order once again.
30371,PART IV,"There is confusion worse than death,"
30372,PART IV,"Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,"
30373,PART IV,"Long labour unto aged breath,"
30374,PART IV,Sore task to hearts worn out with many wars
30375,PART IV,And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.
30376,PART IV,
30377,PART IV,"But, propt on beds of amaranth and moly,"
30378,PART IV,"How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly)"
30379,PART IV,"With half-dropt eyelids still,"
30380,PART IV,"Beneath a heaven dark and holy,"
30381,PART IV,To watch the long bright river drawing slowly
30382,PART IV,His waters from the purple hill--
30383,PART IV,To hear the dewy echoes calling
30384,PART IV,From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine--
30385,PART IV,To watch the emerald-colour'd water falling
30386,PART IV,Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine!
30387,PART IV,"Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,"
30388,PART IV,"Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine."
30389,PART IV,
30390,PART IV,The Lotos blooms below the barren peak:
30391,PART IV,The Lotos blows by every winding creek:
30392,PART IV,All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone:
30393,PART IV,Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone
30394,PART IV,Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.

30399,PART IV,"Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,"
30400,PART IV,In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie relined

30402,PART IV,"For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd"
30403,PART IV,"Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd"
30404,PART IV,"Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world:"

30655,IV,"Athwart a plane of molten glass,"
30656,IV,I scarce could brook the strain and stir
30657,IV,
30658,IV,That makes the barren branches loud;
30659,IV,"And but for fear it is not so,"
30660,IV,The wild unrest that lives in woe
30661,IV,Would dote and pore on yonder cloud
30662,IV,
30663,IV,"That rises upward always higher,"
30664,IV,"And onward drags a labouring breast,"
30665,IV,"And topples round the dreary west,"

30672,V,Was as the whisper of an air
30673,V,To breathe thee over lonely seas.
30674,V,
30675,V,For I in spirit saw thee move
30676,V,"Thro' circles of the bounding sky,"
30677,V,Week after week: the days go by:
30678,V,"Come quick, thou bringest all I love."
30679,V,

30684,V,

30689,V,

30706,VI,
30707,VI,"And crying, How changed from where it ran"
30708,VI,Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb;
30709,VI,But all the lavish hills would hum
30710,VI,The murmur of a happy Pan:
30711,VI,
30712,VI,"When each by turns was guide to each,"
30713,VI,"And Fancy light from Fancy caught,"
30714,VI,And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
30715,VI,Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;
30716,VI,
30717,VI,"And all we met was fair and good,"
30718,VI,"And all was good that Time could bring,"
30719,VI,And all the secret of the Spring
30720,VI,Moved in the chambers of the blood;
30721,VI,
30722,VI,And many an old philosophy
30723,VI,"On Argive heights divinely sang,"

30732,VII,God shut the doorways of his head.
30733,VII,
30734,VII,"The days have vanish'd, tone and tint,"
30735,VII,And yet perhaps the hoarding sense
30736,VII,Gives out at times (he knows not whence)
30737,VII,"A little flash, a mystic hint;"
30738,VII,
30739,VII,And in the long harmonious years
30740,VII,(If Death so taste Lethean springs)
30741,VII,May some dim touch of earthly things
30742,VII,Surprise thee ranging with thy peers.
30743,VII,
30744,VII,"If such a dreamy touch should fall,"
30745,VII,"O turn thee round, resolve the doubt;"

30756,VIII,"Are God and Nature then at strife,"
30757,VIII,That Nature lends such evil dreams?
30758,VIII,"So careful of the type she seems,"

30760,VIII,
30761,VIII,"That I, considering everywhere"
30762,VIII,"Her secret meaning in her deeds,"
30763,VIII,And finding that of fifty seeds
30764,VIII,"She often brings but one to bear,"
30765,VIII,
30766,VIII,"I falter where I firmly trod,"
30767,VIII,And falling with my weight of cares

30770,VIII,

30794,IX,And love Creation's final law--

33152,II,
33153,II,"WHY, having won her, do I woo?"

33155,II,"Provokes me always to pursue,"
33156,II,"But, spirit-like, eludes embrace;"
33157,II,Because her womanhood is such
33158,II,"That, as on court-days subjects kiss"
33159,II,"The Queen's hand, yet so near a touch"
33160,II,Affirms no mean familiarness;
33161,II,"Nay, rather marks more fair the height"
33162,II,Which can with safety so neglect
33163,II,"To dread, as lower ladies might,"
33164,II,That grace could meet with disrespect;
33165,II,Thus she with happy favour feeds
33166,II,Allegiance from a love so high
33167,II,That thence no false conceit proceeds
33168,II,"Of difference bridged, or state put by;"

33173,II,"Not with her least consent of will,"

33176,II,Imputes an unattain'd desert;
33177,II,"Because her gay and lofty brows,"
33178,II,"When all is won which hope can ask,"
33179,II,Reflect a light of hopeless snows
33180,II,That bright in virgin ether bask;

33215,II,"Never, my Love, repent"
33216,II,"Of how, that July afternoon,"
33217,II,"You went,"
33218,II,"With sudden, unintelligible phrase,"
33219,II,"And frighten'd eye,"
33220,II,Upon your journey of so many days
33221,II,"Without a single kiss, or a good-bye?"
33222,II,"I knew, indeed, that you were parting soon;"
33223,II,"And so we sate, within the low sun's rays,"
33224,II,"You whispering to me, for your voice was weak,"
33225,II,Your harrowing praise.
33226,II,"Well, it was well"
33227,II,"To hear you such things speak,"
33228,II,And I could tell
33229,II,"What made your eyes a growing gloom of love,"
33230,II,As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove.
33231,II,And it was like your great and gracious ways
33232,II,"To turn your talk on daily things, my Dear,"
33233,II,"Lifting the luminous, pathetic lash"
33234,II,"To let the laughter flash,"
33235,II,"Whilst I drew near,"
33236,II,Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear.
33237,II,"But all at once to leave me at the last,"
33238,II,"More at the wonder than the loss aghast,"
33239,II,"With huddled, unintelligible phrase,"
33240,II,"And frighten'd eye,"
33241,II,And go your journey of all days
33242,II,"With not one kiss, or a good-bye,"

33244,II,'Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways.

33254,II,"I struck him, and dismiss'd"
33255,II,"With hard words and unkiss'd,"
33256,II,"--His Mother, who was patient, being dead."
33257,II,"Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,"
33258,II,"I visited his bed,"
33259,II,"But found him slumbering deep,"
33260,II,"With darken'd eyelids, and their lashes yet"
33261,II,From his late sobbing wet.
33262,II,"And I, with moan,"
33263,II,"Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;"
33264,II,"For, on a table drawn beside his head,"
33265,II,"He had put, within his reach,"
33266,II,"A box of counters and a red-vein'd stone,"
33267,II,"A piece of glass abraded by the beach,"

33270,II,"And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art,"

33272,II,So when that night I pray'd
33273,II,"To God, I wept, and said:"
33274,II,"Ah, when at last we lie with tranced breath,"

33351,II,"Her misty hair is faint and fair,"

33411,II,Yearn to the impleaded skies for thy return.
33412,II,"Day, like a golden fetter, locks them in,"
33413,II,"And wans the light that withers, tho' it burn"
33414,II,As warmly still for thy return;
33415,II,Still thro' the splendid load uplifts the thin
33416,II,"Pale, paler, palest patience that can learn"
33417,II,Naught but that votive sign for thy return--

33449,II,"In the valley left behind,"

33451,II,"With purple streaks of woe,"
33452,II,When the battle has roll'd by

33456,II,
33457,II,"Then came the daisies,"

33459,II,Like a banner'd show's advance
33460,II,"While the crowd runs by the way,"
33461,II,With ten thousand flowers about them they came trooping through the

33486,II,The bed of state is hung with crape--the grand old bed where she was
33487,II,wed--
33488,II,And like an upright corpse she sitteth gazing dumbly at the bed.
33489,II,"Hour by hour her serving-men enter by the curtain'd door,"

33493,II,"'Touch him not,' she shriek'd and cried, 'he is but newly dead!'"
33494,II,"'O my own dear mistress,' the ancient Nurse did say,"

33500,II,"'On your lives!' she shriek'd and cried, 'he is but newly dead!'"
33501,II,"Then a father Priest they sought,"
33502,II,"The Priest that taught her all she knew,"
33503,II,And they told him of her loss.
33504,II,"'For she is mild and sweet of will,"
33505,II,"She loved him, and his words are peace,"
33506,II,And he shall heal her ill.'
33507,II,But her watch she did not cease.

33511,II,But she neither saw nor heard;

33514,II,"All she had been fond to hear,"
33515,II,"Missall'd prayer, and solemn speech,"

33517,II,"Only when he turn'd to speak with those who wept about the bed,"
33518,II,"'On your lives!' she shriek'd and cried, 'he is but newly dead!'"
33519,II,"Then how sadly he turn'd from her, it were wonderful to tell,"
33520,II,"And he stood beside the death-bed as by one who slumbers well,"
33521,II,"And he lean'd o'er him who lay there, and in cautious whisper low,"
33522,II,"'He is not dead, but sleepeth,' said the Priest, and smooth'd his"
33523,II,brow.
33524,II,"'Sleepeth?' said she, looking up, and the sun rose in her face!"
33525,II,"'He must be better than I thought, for the sleep is very sound.'"
33526,II,"'He is better,' said the Priest, and call'd her maidens round."
33527,II,With them came that ancient dame who nursed her when a child;
33528,II,"O Nurse!' she sigh'd, 'O Nurse!' she cried 'O Nurse!' and then she"
33529,II,"smiled,"
33530,II,And then she wept; with that they drew
33531,II,"About her, as of old;"
33532,II,"Her dying eyes were sweet and blue,"
33533,II,Her trembling touch was cold;
33534,II,"But she said, 'My maidens true,"
33535,II,No more weeping and well-away;
33536,II,Let them kill the feast.
33537,II,I would be happy in my soul.
33538,II,"""He is better,"" saith the Priest;"
33539,II,"He did but sleep the weary day,"
33540,II,And will waken whole.
33541,II,"Carry me to his dear side,"
33542,II,And let the halls be trim;
33543,II,"Whistly, whistly,' said she,"
33544,II,"'I am wan with watching and wail,"
33545,II,"He must not wake to see me pale,"
33546,II,Let me sleep with him.
33547,II,"See you keep the tryst for me,"
33548,II,I would rest till he awake
33549,II,And rise up like a bride.
33550,II,"But whistly, whistly!' said she."
33551,II,'Yet rejoice your Lord doth live;
33552,II,And for His dear sake
33553,II,"Say Laus, Domine.'"
33554,II,"Silent they cast down their eyes,"
33555,II,"And every breast a sob did rive,"
33556,II,She lifted her in wild surprise
33557,II,And they dared not disobey.
33558,II,"'Laus Deo,' said the Steward, hoary when her days were new;"
33559,II,"'Laus Deo,' said the Warrener, whiter than the warren snows;"
33560,II,"'Laus Deo,' the bald Henchman, who had nursed her on his knee."
33561,II,"The old Nurse moved her lips in vain,"
33562,II,And she stood among the train
33563,II,Like a dead tree shaking dew.
33564,II,Then the Priest he softly stept
33565,II,"Midway in the little band,"
33566,II,And he took the Lady's hand.
33567,II,"'Laus Deo,' he said aloud,"
33568,II,"'Laus Deo,' they said again,"
33569,II,"Yet again, and yet again,"
33570,II,"Humbly cross'd and lowly bow'd,"
33571,II,Till in wont and fear it rose
33572,II,To the Sabbath strain.
33573,II,But she neither turn'd her head
33574,II,"Nor 'Whistly, whistly,' said she."
33575,II,"Her hands were folded as in grace,"
33576,II,We laid her with her ancient race
33577,II,And all the village wept.

33587,II,For fear of little men;
33588,II,"Wee folk, good folk,"
33589,II,Trooping all together;
33590,II,"Green jacket, red cap,"
33591,II,And white owl's feather!
33592,II,
33593,II,Down along the rocky shore
33594,II,"Some make their home,"
33595,II,They live on crispy pancakes
33596,II,Of yellow tide-foam;
33597,II,Some in the reeds
33598,II,"Of the black mountain lake,"
33599,II,"With frogs for their watch-dogs,"
33600,II,All night awake.
33601,II,
33602,II,High on the hill-top
33603,II,The old King sits;
33604,II,He is now so old and gray
33605,II,He 's nigh lost his wits.
33606,II,With a bridge of white mist
33607,II,"Columbkill he crosses,"
33608,II,On his stately journeys
33609,II,From Slieveleague to Rosses;
33610,II,Or going up with music
33611,II,On cold starry nights
33612,II,To sup with the Queen
33613,II,Of the gay Northern Lights.
33614,II,
33615,II,They stole little Bridget
33616,II,For seven years long;
33617,II,When she came down again
33618,II,Her friends were all gone.
33619,II,"They took her lightly back,"
33620,II,"Between the night and morrow,"
33621,II,"They thought that she was fast asleep,"
33622,II,But she was dead with sorrow.
33623,II,They have kept her ever since
33624,II,"Deep within the lake,"
33625,II,"On a bed of flag-leaves,"
33626,II,Watching till she wake.
33627,II,
33628,II,"By the craggy hill-side,"
33629,II,"Through the mosses bare,"
33630,II,They have planted thorn-trees
33631,II,For pleasure here and there.
33632,II,If any man so daring
33633,II,"As dig them up in spite,"
33634,II,He shall find their sharpest thorns

33650,II,
33651,II,THEY all were looking for a king
33652,II,To slay their foes and lift them high:
33653,II,"Thou cam'st, a little baby thing"
33654,II,That made a woman cry.
33655,II,
33656,II,"O Son of Man, to right my lot"
33657,II,Naught but Thy presence can avail;
33658,II,"Yet on the road Thy wheels are not,"
33659,II,Nor on the sea Thy sail!
33660,II,
33661,II,"My how or when Thou wilt not heed,"

33670,II,
33671,II,THE blessed Damozel lean'd out
33672,II,From the gold bar of Heaven:
33673,II,Her blue grave eyes were deeper much
33674,II,"Than a deep water, even."
33675,II,"She had three lilies in her hand,"
33676,II,And the stars in her hair were seven.
33677,II,
33678,II,"Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,"
33679,II,"No wrought flowers did adorn,"
33680,II,But a white rose of Mary's gift
33681,II,On the neck meetly worn;
33682,II,"And her hair, lying down her back,"
33683,II,Was yellow like ripe corn.
33684,II,
33685,II,Herseem'd she scarce had been a day
33686,II,One of God's choristers;
33687,II,The wonder was not yet quite gone
33688,II,From that still look of hers;
33689,II,"Albeit, to them she left, her day"
33690,II,Had counted as ten years.
33691,II,
33692,II,(To one it is ten years of years:
33693,II,"...Yet now, here in this place,"
33694,II,"Surely she lean'd o'er me,--her hair"
33695,II,Fell all about my face....
33696,II,Nothing: the Autumn-fall of leaves.
33697,II,The whole year sets apace.)
33698,II,
33699,II,It was the terrace of God's house
33700,II,"That she was standing on,--"
33701,II,By God built over the sheer depth
33702,II,In which Space is begun;
33703,II,"So high, that looking downward thence,"
33704,II,She scarce could see the sun.
33705,II,
33706,II,It lies from Heaven across the flood
33707,II,"Of ether, as a bridge."
33708,II,"Beneath, the tides of day and night"
33709,II,With flame and darkness ridge
33710,II,"The void, as low as where this earth"
33711,II,Spins like a fretful midge.
33712,II,
33713,II,"But in those tracts, with her, it was"
33714,II,The peace of utter light
33715,II,And silence. For no breeze may stir
33716,II,Along the steady flight
33717,II,"Of seraphim; no echo there,"
33718,II,Beyond all depth or height.
33719,II,
33720,II,"Heard hardly, some of her new friends,"
33721,II,"Playing at holy games,"
33722,II,"Spake gentle-mouth'd, among themselves,"
33723,II,Their virginal chaste names;
33724,II,"And the souls, mounting up to God,"
33725,II,Went by her like thin flames.
33726,II,
33727,II,"And still she bow'd herself, and stoop'd"
33728,II,Into the vast waste calm;
33729,II,Till her bosom's pressure must have made
33730,II,"The bar she lean'd on warm,"
33731,II,And the lilies lay as if asleep
33732,II,Along her bended arm.
33733,II,
33734,II,"From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw"
33735,II,"Time, like a pulse, shake fierce"
33736,II,"Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove,"
33737,II,"In that steep gulf, to pierce"
33738,II,"The swarm; and then she spoke, as when"
33739,II,The stars sang in their spheres.
33740,II,
33741,II,"'I wish that he were come to me,"
33742,II,"For he will come,' she said."
33743,II,'Have I not pray'd in solemn Heaven?
33744,II,"On earth, has he not pray'd?"
33745,II,Are not two prayers a perfect strength?
33746,II,And shall I feel afraid?
33747,II,
33748,II,"'When round his head the aureole clings,"
33749,II,"And he is clothed in white,"
33750,II,"I'll take his hand, and go with him"
33751,II,"To the deep wells of light,"
33752,II,And we will step down as to a stream
33753,II,And bathe there in God's sight.
33754,II,
33755,II,"'We two will stand beside that shrine,"
33756,II,"Occult, withheld, untrod,"
33757,II,Whose lamps tremble continually
33758,II,With prayer sent up to God;
33759,II,"And where each need, reveal'd, expects"
33760,II,Its patient period.
33761,II,
33762,II,'We two will lie i' the shadow of
33763,II,That living mystic tree
33764,II,Within whose secret growth the Dove
33765,II,"Sometimes is felt to be,"
33766,II,While every leaf that His plumes touch
33767,II,Saith His name audibly.
33768,II,
33769,II,"'And I myself will teach to him,--"
33770,II,"I myself, lying so,--"
33771,II,The songs I sing here; which his mouth
33772,II,"Shall pause in, hush'd and slow,"
33773,II,"Finding some knowledge at each pause,"
33774,II,And some new thing to know.'
33775,II,
33776,II,(Alas! to her wise simple mind
33777,II,These things were all but known
33778,II,"Before: they trembled on her sense,--"
33779,II,Her voice had caught their tone.
33780,II,Alas for lonely Heaven! Alas
33781,II,For life wrung out alone!
33782,II,
33783,II,"Alas, and though the end were reach'd?..."
33784,II,Was thy part understood
33785,II,Or borne in trust? And for her sake
33786,II,Shall this too be found good?--
33787,II,May the close lips that knew not prayer
33788,II,"Praise ever, though they would?)"
33789,II,
33790,II,"'We two,' she said, 'will seek the groves"
33791,II,"Where the lady Mary is,"
33792,II,"With her five handmaidens, whose names"
33793,II,Are five sweet symphonies:--
33794,II,"Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,"
33795,II,Margaret and Rosalys.
33796,II,
33797,II,"'Circle-wise sit they, with bound locks"
33798,II,And bosoms covered;
33799,II,"Into the fine cloth, white like flame,"
33800,II,"Weaving the golden thread,"
33801,II,To fashion the birth-robes for them
33802,II,"Who are just born, being dead."
33803,II,
33804,II,"'He shall fear, haply, and be dumb."
33805,II,Then I will lay my cheek
33806,II,"To his, and tell about our love,"
33807,II,Not once abash'd or weak:
33808,II,And the dear Mother will approve
33809,II,"My pride, and let me speak."
33810,II,
33811,II,"'Herself shall bring us, hand in hand,"
33812,II,To Him round whom all souls
33813,II,Kneel--the unnumber'd solemn heads
33814,II,Bow'd with their aureoles:
33815,II,"And Angels, meeting us, shall sing"
33816,II,To their citherns and citoles.
33817,II,
33818,II,'There will I ask of Christ the Lord
33819,II,Thus much for him and me:--
33820,II,To have more blessing than on earth
33821,II,In nowise; but to be
33822,II,"As then we were,--being as then"
33823,II,"At peace. Yea, verily."
33824,II,
33825,II,"'Yea, verily; when he is come"
33826,II,We will do thus and thus:
33827,II,Till this my vigil seem quite strange
33828,II,And almost fabulous;
33829,II,"We two will live at once, one life;"
33830,II,And peace shall be with us.'
33831,II,
33832,II,"She gazed, and listen'd, and then said,"
33833,II,"Less sad of speech than mild,--"
33834,II,'All this is when he comes.' She ceased:
33835,II,"The light thrill'd past her, fill'd"
33836,II,"With Angels, in strong level lapse."
33837,II,"Her eyes pray'd, and she smiled."
33838,II,
33839,II,(I saw her smile.) But soon their flight
33840,II,Was vague 'mid the poised spheres.
33841,II,And then she cast her arms along
33842,II,"The golden barriers,"
33843,II,"And laid her face between her hands,"
33844,II,And wept. (I heard her tears.)

33850,II,

33852,II,"Couch'd with her arms behind her golden head,"
33853,II,"Knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly,"
33854,II,Lies my young love sleeping in the shade.
33855,II,"Had I the heart to slide an arm beneath her,"
33856,II,"Press her parting lips as her waist I gather slow,"
33857,II,Waking in amazement she could not but embrace me:
33858,II,Then would she hold me and never let me go?
33859,II,.      .      .
33860,II,"Shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow,"
33861,II,Swift as the swallow along the river's light
33862,II,"Circleting the surface to meet his mirror'd winglets,"
33863,II,Fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight.
33864,II,"Shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine-tops,"
33865,II,"Wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun,"
33866,II,"She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer,"
33867,II,"Hard, but O the glory of the winning were she won!"

33872,II,"More love should I have, and much less care."
33873,II,"When her mother tends her before the lighted mirror,"
33874,II,"Loosening her laces, combing down her curls,"
33875,II,"Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,"
33876,II,I should miss but one for many boys and girls.
33877,II,.      .      .
33878,II,Heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows
33879,II,Flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon.
33880,II,"No, she is athirst and drinking up her wonder:"
33881,II,Earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon.
33882,II,"Deals she an unkindness, 'tis but her rapid measure,"
33883,II,Even as in a dance; and her smile can heal no less:
33884,II,Like the swinging May-cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones
33885,II,"Off a sunny border, she was made to bruise and bless."

33894,II,Tell it to forget the source that keeps it fill'd.

33896,II,"Stepping down the hill with her fair companions,"

33898,II,"Boldly she sings, to the merry tune she marches,"
33899,II,"Brave is her shape, and sweeter unpossess'd."
33900,II,"Sweeter, for she is what my heart first awaking"
33901,II,Whisper'd the world was; morning light is she.
33902,II,Love that so desires would fain keep her changeless;

33908,II,"Threading it with colour, like yewberries the yew."
33909,II,Thicker crowd the shades as the grave East deepens
33910,II,"Glowing, and with crimson a long cloud swells."

33917,II,Chill as a dull face frowning on a song.
33918,II,"Ay, but shows the South-west a ripple-feather'd bosom"
33919,II,Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend
33920,II,"Scaling the mid-heavens as they stream, there comes a sunset"
33921,II,"Rich, deep like love in beauty without end."
33922,II,.      .      .
33923,II,"When at dawn she sighs, and like an infant to the window"
33924,II,"Turns grave eyes craving light, released from dreams,"
33925,II,"Beautiful she looks, like a white water-lily"
33926,II,Bursting out of bud in havens of the streams.
33927,II,When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle
33928,II,"In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May,"
33929,II,"Beautiful she looks, like a tall garden-lily"
33930,II,"Pure from the night, and splendid for the day."

33932,II,"Mother of the dews, dark eye-lash'd twilight,"
33933,II,"Low-lidded twilight, o'er the valley's brim,"
33934,II,"Rounding on thy breast sings the dew-delighted skylark,"
33935,II,Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him.
33936,II,"Hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet,"
33937,II,Fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers.
33938,II,"Let me hear her laughter, I would have her ever"
33939,II,"Cool as dew in twilight, the lark above the flowers."
33940,II,.      .      .
33941,II,All the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose;
33942,II,"Up lanes, woods through, they troop in joyful bands."
33943,II,"My sweet leads: she knows not why, but now she loiters,"
33944,II,"Eyes the bent anemones, and hangs her hands."
33945,II,"Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping,"
33946,II,Coming the rose: and unaware a cry
33947,II,"Springs in her bosom for odours and for colour,"
33948,II,Covert and the nightingale; she knows not why.
33949,II,.      .      .
33950,II,"Kerchief'd head and chin she darts between her tulips,"
33951,II,Streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain:
33952,II,"Some bend beaten cheek to gravel, and their angel"
33953,II,"She will be; she lifts them, and on she speeds again."
33954,II,Black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway:
33955,II,She is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth.
33956,II,So when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder
33957,II,"Saw I once a white dove, sole light of earth."
33958,II,
33959,II,"Prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden,"
33960,II,"Train'd to stand in rows, and asking if they please."
33961,II,I might love them well but for loving more the wild ones:
33962,II,O my wild ones! they tell me more than these.
33963,II,"You, my wild one, you tell of honied field-rose,"
33964,II,"Violet, blushing eglantine in life; and even as they,"
33965,II,"They by the wayside are earnest of your goodness,"
33966,II,"You are of life's, on the banks that line the way."
33967,II,.      .      .
33968,II,"Peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose,"
33969,II,Jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three.
33970,II,Parted is the window; she sleeps; the starry jasmine
33971,II,Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me.
33972,II,"Sweeter unpossess'd, have I said of her my sweetest?"
33973,II,"Not while she sleeps: while she sleeps the jasmine breathes,"
33974,II,Luring her to love; she sleeps; the starry jasmine
33975,II,Bears me to her pillow under white rose-wreaths.
33976,II,.      .      .
33977,II,Yellow with birdfoot-trefoil are the grass-glades;
33978,II,Yellow with cinquefoil of the dew-gray leaf;
33979,II,Yellow with stonecrop; the moss-mounds are yellow;
33980,II,"Blue-neck'd the wheat sways, yellowing to the sheaf."
33981,II,"Green-yellow, bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle;"
33982,II,Sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine:
33983,II,"Earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens,"
33984,II,Thinking of the harvest: I look and think of mine.
33985,II,.      .      .
33986,II,This I may know: her dressing and undressing
33987,II,Such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport
33988,II,Shift from cloud to moonlight; or edging over thunder
33989,II,Slips a ray of sun; or sweeping into port
33990,II,White sails furl; or on the ocean borders
33991,II,White sails lean along the waves leaping green.
33992,II,"Visions of her shower before me, but from eyesight"
33993,II,Guarded she would be like the sun were she seen.

33995,II,Front door and back of the moss'd old farmhouse
33996,II,"Open with the morn, and in a breezy link"
33997,II,"Freshly sparkles garden to stripe-shadow'd orchard,"
33998,II,Green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink.
33999,II,Busy in the grass the early sun of summer
34000,II,"Swarms, and the blackbird's mellow fluting notes"
34001,II,Call my darling up with round and roguish challenge:
34002,II,"Quaintest, richest carol of all the singing throats!"
34003,II,.      .      .
34004,II,Cool was the woodside; cool as her white diary
34005,II,"Keeping sweet the cream-pan; and there the boys from school,"
34006,II,"Cricketing below, rush'd brown and red with sunshine;"
34007,II,O the dark translucence of the deep-eyed cool!
34008,II,"Spying from the farm, herself she fetch'd a pitcher"
34009,II,"Full of milk, and tilted for each in turn the beak."
34010,II,"Then a little fellow, mouth up and on tiptoe,"
34011,II,"Said, 'I will kiss you': she laugh'd and lean'd her cheek."
34012,II,.      .      .
34013,II,Doves of the fir-wood walling high our red roof
34014,II,"Through the long noon coo, crooning through the coo."
34015,II,"Loose droop the leaves, and down the sleepy roadway"
34016,II,Sometimes pipes a chaffinch; loose droops the blue.
34017,II,"Cows flap a show tail knee-deep in the river,"
34018,II,"Breathless, given up to sun and gnat and fly."
34019,II,"Nowhere is she seen; and if I see her nowhere,"
34020,II,"Lighting may come, straight rains and tiger sky."
34021,II,.      .      .
34022,II,"O the golden sheaf, the rustling treasure-armful!"
34023,II,O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!
34024,II,O the treasure-tresses one another over
34025,II,Nodding! O the girdle slack about the waist!
34026,II,Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
34027,II,"Quick amid the wheat-ears: wound about the waist,"
34028,II,"Gather'd, see these brides of Earth one blush of ripeness!"
34029,II,O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!
34030,II,.      .      .
34031,II,"Large and smoky red the sun's cold disk drops,"
34032,II,"Clipp'd by naked hills, on violet shaded snow:"
34033,II,"Eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise,"
34034,II,Whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow.
34035,II,Nightlong on black print-branches our beech-tree
34036,II,Gazes in this whiteness: nightlong could I.
34037,II,Here may life on death or death on life be painted.
34038,II,Let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die!
34039,II,.      .      .
34040,II,Gossips count her faults; they scour a narrow chamber
34041,II,"Where there is no window, read not heaven or her."
34042,II,"'When she was a tiny,' one aged woman quavers,"
34043,II,Plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear.
34044,II,Faults she had once as she learn'd to run and tumbled:
34045,II,"Faults of feature some see, beauty not complete."
34046,II,"Yet, good gossips, beauty that makes holy"
34047,II,"Earth and air, may have faults from head to feet."
34048,II,.      .      .
34049,II,"Hither she comes; she comes to me; she lingers,"
34050,II,"Deepens her brown eyebrows, while in new surprise"
34051,II,High rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger;
34052,II,Yet am I the light and living of her eyes.
34053,II,"Something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming,"
34054,II,"Nets her in her blushes, and wounds her, and tames.--"
34055,II,"Sure of her haven, O like a dove alighting,"
34056,II,"Arms up, she dropp'd: our souls were in our names."
34057,II,.      .      .
34058,II,Soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise.
34059,II,"Yellow oats and brown wheat, barley pale as rye,"
34060,II,"Long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher,"
34061,II,"Felt the girdle loosen'd, seen the tresses fly."
34062,II,Soon will she lie like a blood-red sunset.
34063,II,"Swift with the to-morrow, green-wing'd Spring!"
34064,II,"Sing from the South-west, bring her back the truants,"
34065,II,"Nightingale and swallow, song and dipping wing."
34066,II,.      .      .
34067,II,"Soft new beech-leaves, up to beamy April"
34068,II,"Spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain, you"
34069,II,"Lucid in the moon, raise lilies to the skyfields,"
34070,II,Youngest green transfused in silver shining through:
34071,II,"Fairer than the lily, than the wild white cherry:"
34072,II,Fair as in image my seraph love appears
34073,II,Borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids:
34074,II,Fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears.
34075,II,.      .      .
34076,II,"Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,"
34077,II,I would speak my heart out: heaven is my need.
34078,II,"Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood,"
34079,II,"Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed."
34080,II,Flushing like the dogwood crimson in October;
34081,II,Streaming like the flag-reed South-west blown;
34082,II,Flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted whitebeam:
34083,II,All seem to know what is for heaven alone.

34094,II,"Mindful were the shepherds, as now the noon severe"
34095,II,"Bent a burning eyebrow to brown evetide,"
34096,II,"How the rustic flute drew the silver to the sphere,"
34097,II,"Sister of his own, till her rays fell wide."
34098,II,God! of whom music
34099,II,"And song and blood are pure,"
34100,II,The day is never darken'd
34101,II,That had thee here obscure.
34102,II,"Chirping none, the scarlet cicalas crouch'd in ranks:"
34103,II,Slack the thistle-head piled its down-silk gray:
34104,II,Scarce the stony lizard suck'd hollows in his flanks:
34105,II,Thick on spots of umbrage our drowsed flocks lay.
34106,II,"Sudden bow'd the chestnuts beneath a wind unheard,"
34107,II,"Lengthen'd ran the grasses, the sky grew slate:"
34108,II,"Then amid a swift flight of wing'd seed white as curd,"
34109,II,Clear of limb a Youth smote the master's gate.
34110,II,God! of whom music

34115,II,"Water, first of singers, o'er rocky mount and mead,"
34116,II,"First of earthly singers, the sun-loved rill,"
34117,II,"Sang of him, and flooded the ripples on the reed,"
34118,II,Seeking whom to waken and what ear fill.
34119,II,"Water, sweetest soother to kiss a wound and cool,"
34120,II,"Sweetest and divinest, the sky-born brook,"
34121,II,"Chuckled, with a whimper, and made a mirror-pool"
34122,II,"Round the guest we welcomed, the strange hand shook."

34128,II,Many swarms of wild bees descended on our fields:
34129,II,Stately stood the wheatstalk with head bent high:
34130,II,"Big of heart we labour'd at storing mighty yields,"
34131,II,"Wool and corn, and clusters to make men cry!"
34132,II,Hand-like rush'd the vintage; we strung the bellied skins
34133,II,"Plump, and at the sealing the Youth's voice rose:"
34134,II,"Maidens clung in circle, on little fists their chins;"
34135,II,Gentle beasties through push'd a cold long nose.

34141,II,Foot to fire in snowtime we trimm'd the slender shaft:
34142,II,Often down the pit spied the lean wolf's teeth
34143,II,"Grin against his will, trapp'd by masterstrokes of craft;"
34144,II,Helpless in his froth-wrath as green logs seethe!
34145,II,"Safe the tender lambs tugg'd the teats, and winter sped"
34146,II,"Whirl'd before the crocus, the year's new gold."

34157,II,Ease because the creature was all too fair.
34158,II,Pleasant ran our thinking that while our work was good.
34159,II,Sure as fruits for sweat would the praise come fast.
34160,II,He that wrestled stoutest and tamed the billow-brood
34161,II,"Danced in rings with girls, like a sail-flapp'd mast."

34202,II,
34203,II,"Now hill to hill has made the stride,"

34205,II,Now in the breast a door flings wide;
34206,II,"Our farthest smiles, our next is friend."
34207,II,And song of England's rush of flowers
34208,II,"Is this full breeze with mellow stops,"
34209,II,"That spins the lark for shine, for showers;"
34210,II,"He drinks his hurried flight, and drops."

34214,II,Or leap to find the waterway.
34215,II,"'Tis equal to a wonder done,"
34216,II,Whatever simple lives renew
34217,II,"Their tricks beneath the father sun,"
34218,II,As though they caught a broken clue:
34219,II,So hard was earth an eyewink back;
34220,II,"But now the common life has come,"
34221,II,"The blotting cloud a dappled pack,"
34222,II,The grasses one vast underhum.
34223,II,"A City clothed in snow and soot,"

34228,II,Play spectre upon eye and mouth:--
34229,II,Their faces are a glass to greet
34230,II,This magic of the whirl for South.
34231,II,A burly joy each creature swells
34232,II,With sound of its own hungry quest;
34233,II,"Earth has to fill her empty wells,"
34234,II,And speed the service of the nest;
34235,II,"The phantom of the snow-wreath melt,"
34236,II,"That haunts the farmer's look abroad,"
34237,II,"Who sees what tomb a white night built,"
34238,II,Where flocks now bleat and sprouts the clod.
34239,II,For iron Winter held her firm;
34240,II,Across her sky he laid his hand;
34241,II,"And bird he starved, he stiffen'd worm;"
34242,II,"A sightless heaven, a shaven land."
34243,II,"Her shivering Spring feign'd fast asleep,"
34244,II,The bitten buds dared not unfold:

34260,II,Here is a fitting spot to dig Love's grave;
34261,II,"Here where the ponderous breakers plunge and strike,"
34262,II,And dart their hissing tongues high up the sand:
34263,II,"In hearing of the ocean, and in sight"
34264,II,Of those ribb'd wind-streaks running into white.
34265,II,"If I the death of Love had deeply plann'd,"
34266,II,"I never could have made it half so sure,"
34267,II,As by the unblest kisses which upbraid
34268,II,"The full-waked sense; or failing that, degrade!"

34281,II,Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend
34282,II,"Above the rolling ball in cloud part screen'd,"
34283,II,Where sinners hugg'd their spectre of repose.
34284,II,Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.
34285,II,"And now upon his western wing he lean'd,"
34286,II,"Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands careen'd,"
34287,II,Now the black planet shadow'd Arctic snows.
34288,II,Soaring through wider zones that prick'd his scars
34289,II,"With memory of the old revolt from Awe,"
34290,II,"He reach'd a middle height, and at the stars,"
34291,II,"Which are the brain of heaven, he look'd, and sank."

34302,II,"The wind-swept bluebells on the sunny braes,"
34303,II,"Down to the central fires,"
34304,II,
34305,II,Exist alike in Love. Love is a sea
34306,II,Filling all the abysses dim
34307,II,"Of lornest space, in whose deeps regally"
34308,II,Suns and their bright broods swim.
34309,II,
34310,II,"This mighty sea of Love, with wondrous tides,"
34311,II,Is sternly just to sun and grain;
34312,II,"'Tis laving at this moment Saturn's sides,"
34313,II,'Tis in my blood and brain.
34314,II,
34315,II,All things have something more than barren use;
34316,II,"There is a scent upon the brier,"
34317,II,"A tremulous splendour in the autumn dews,"
34318,II,Cold morns are fringed with fire.
34319,II,
34320,II,The clodded earth goes up in sweet-breath'd flowers;
34321,II,"In music dies poor human speech,"
34322,II,And into beauty blow those hearts of ours
34323,II,When Love is born in each.

34334,II,
34335,II,"ON the Sabbath-day,"
34336,II,"Through the churchyard old and gray,"
34337,II,Over the crisp and yellow leaves I held my rustling way;
34338,II,"And amid the words of mercy, falling on my soul like balms,"
34339,II,"'Mid the gorgeous storms of music--in the mellow organ-calms,"
34340,II,"'Mid the upward-streaming prayers, and the rich and solemn psalms,"
34341,II,"I stood careless, Barbara."
34342,II,
34343,II,"My heart was otherwhere,"
34344,II,"While the organ shook the air,"
34345,II,"And the priest, with outspread hands, bless'd the people with a"
34346,II,prayer;
34347,II,"But when rising to go homeward, with a mild and saintlike shine"
34348,II,Gleam'd a face of airy beauty with its heavenly eyes on mine--
34349,II,Gleam'd and vanish'd in a moment--O that face was surely thine
34350,II,"Out of heaven, Barbara!"
34351,II,

34353,II,O earnest eyes of grace!
34354,II,"When last I saw thee, dearest, it was in another place."
34355,II,You came running forth to meet me with my love-gift on your wrist:
34356,II,"The flutter of a long white dress, then all was lost in mist--"
34357,II,"A purple stain of agony was on the mouth I kiss'd,"
34358,II,"That wild morning, Barbara."
34359,II,
34360,II,"I search'd, in my despair,"
34361,II,Sunny noon and midnight air;
34362,II,I could not drive away the thought that you were lingering there.
34363,II,"O many and many a winter night I sat when you were gone,"
34364,II,"My worn face buried in my hands, beside the fire alone--"
34365,II,"Within the dripping churchyard, the rain plashing on your stone,"
34366,II,"You were sleeping, Barbara."
34367,II,
34368,II,"'Mong angels, do you think"
34369,II,Of the precious golden link
34370,II,I clasp'd around your happy arm while sitting by yon brink?
34371,II,"Or when that night of gliding dance, of laughter and guitars,"
34372,II,"Was emptied of its music, and we watch'd, through lattice-bars,"
34373,II,"The silent midnight heaven creeping o'er us with its stars,"
34374,II,"Till the day broke, Barbara?"
34375,II,
34376,II,In the years I've changed;
34377,II,"Wild and far my heart has ranged,"
34378,II,And many sins and errors now have been on me avenged;
34379,II,But to you I have been faithful whatsoever good I lack'd:
34380,II,"I loved you, and above my life still hangs that love intact--"
34381,II,"Your love the trembling rainbow, I the reckless cataract."
34382,II,Still I love you. Barbara.
34383,II,
34384,II,"Yet, Love, I am unblest;"
34385,II,"With many doubts opprest,"
34386,II,I wander like the desert wind without a place of rest.
34387,II,"Could I but win you for an hour from off that starry shore,"
34388,II,The hunger of my soul were still'd; for Death hath told you more
34389,II,Than the melancholy world doth know--things deeper than all lore
34390,II,"You could teach me, Barbara."
34391,II,
34392,II,"In vain, in vain, in vain!"
34393,II,You will never come again.
34394,II,There droops upon the dreary hills a mournful fringe of rain;
34395,II,"The gloaming closes slowly round, loud winds are in the tree,"
34396,II,Round selfish shores for ever moans the hurt and wounded sea;
34397,II,"There is no rest upon the earth, peace is with Death and thee--"
34398,II,Barbara!

35706,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35707,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),For always thee the fervid languid glories
35708,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Allured of heavier suns in mightier skies;
35709,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs
35710,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories,"
35711,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The barren kiss of piteous wave to wave
35712,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),That knows not where is that Leucadian grave
35713,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Which hides too deep the supreme head of song.
35714,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Ah, salt and sterile as her kisses were,"
35715,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear
35716,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Hither and thither, and vex and work her wrong,"
35717,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Blind gods that cannot spare.
35718,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35719,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thou sawest, in thine old singing season, brother,"
35720,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us:
35721,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Fierce loves, and lovely leaf-buds poisonous,"
35722,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Bare to thy subtler eye, but for none other"
35723,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime;
35724,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The hidden harvest of luxurious time,"
35725,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Sin without shape, and pleasure without speech;"
35726,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep
35727,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep;
35728,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And with each face thou sawest the shadow on each,"
35729,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Seeing as men sow men reap.
35730,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35731,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping,"
35732,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),That were athirst for sleep and no more life
35733,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And no more love, for peace and no more strife!"
35734,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Now the dim gods of death have in their keeping
35735,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Spirit and body and all the springs of song,"
35736,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Is it well now where love can do no wrong,"
35737,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang
35738,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Behind the unopening closure of her lips?
35739,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Is it not well where soul from body slips
35740,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And flesh from bone divides without a pang
35741,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),As dew from flower-bell drips?
35742,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35743,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),It is enough; the end and the beginning

35745,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O hand unclasp'd of unbeholden friend,"

35747,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"No triumph and no labour and no lust,"
35748,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Only dead yew-leaves and a little dust.

35759,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Such as thy vision here solicited,"
35760,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Under the shadow of her fair vast head,"
35761,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The deep division of prodigious breasts,"
35762,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep,"
35763,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The weight of awful tresses that still keep
35764,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests
35765,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Where the wet hill-winds weep?
35766,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35767,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Hast thou found any likeness for thy vision?
35768,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what bloom,"
35769,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Hast thou found sown, what gather'd in the gloom?"
35770,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"What of despair, of rapture, of derision,"
35771,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"What of life is there, what of ill or good?"
35772,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood?
35773,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Does the dim ground grow any seed of ours,"
35774,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The faint fields quicken any terrene root,"
35775,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),In low lands where the sun and moon are mute
35776,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And all the stars keep silence? Are there flowers
35777,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"At all, or any fruit?"
35778,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35779,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Alas, but though my flying song flies after,"
35780,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"O sweet strange elder singer, thy more fleet"
35781,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Singing, and footprints of thy fleeter feet,"
35782,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Some dim derision of mysterious laughter
35783,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"From the blind tongueless warders of the dead,"
35784,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Some gainless glimpse of Proserpine's veil'd head,"
35785,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Some little sound of unregarded tears
35786,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Wept by effaced unprofitable eyes,"
35787,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs--
35788,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"These only, these the hearkening spirit hears,"
35789,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Sees only such things rise.
35790,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35791,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thou art far too far for wings of words to follow,"
35792,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Far too far off for thought or any prayer.
35793,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"What ails us with thee, who art wind and air?"
35794,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?
35795,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Yet with some fancy, yet with some desire,"
35796,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire,"
35797,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Our dreams pursue our dead and do not find.
35798,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Still, and more swift than they, the thin flame flies,"

35800,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Still the foil'd earnest ear is deaf, and blind"
35801,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Are still the eluded eyes.

35813,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Of many mourners roll'd.
35814,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35815,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"I among these, I also, in such station"

35818,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The old mourners had, standing to make libation,"
35819,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"I stand, and to the Gods and to the dead"
35820,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Do reverence without prayer or praise, and shed"

35823,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And what I may of fruits in this chill'd air,"
35824,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"And lay, Orestes-like, across the tomb"
35825,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),A curl of sever'd hair.
35826,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
35827,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"But by no hand nor any treason stricken,"
35828,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Not like the low-lying head of Him, the King,"
35829,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"The flame that made of Troy a ruinous thing,"
35830,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Thou liest and on this dust no tears could quicken.
35831,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear
35832,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Fall tear by sweet imperishable tear
35833,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Down the opening leaves of holy poets' pages.

35843,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),With the soft flame and heat of songs that shine.
35844,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thy lips indeed he touch'd with bitter wine,"
35845,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),And nourish'd them indeed with bitter bread;
35846,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Yet surely from his hand thy soul's food came,"
35847,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),The fire that scarr'd thy spirit at his flame
35848,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Was lighted, and thine hungering heart he fed"

36119,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),For my heart no measure
36120,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Knows, nor other treasure"

36124,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thou gray-eyed mourner, fly not yet away:"

36126,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thy sad weeds to-morrow,"
36127,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),To make a mourning for love's yesterday.
36128,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),

36140,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),DARK to me is the earth. Dark to me are the heavens.
36141,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Where is she that I loved, the woman with eyes like stars?"
36142,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Desolate are the streets. Desolate is the city.
36143,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"A city taken by storm, where none are left but the slain."
36144,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36145,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Sadly I rose at dawn, undid the latch of my shutters,"
36146,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thinking to let in light, but I only let in love."
36147,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Birds in the boughs were awake; I listen'd to their chaunting;
36148,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Each one sang to his love; only I was alone.
36149,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36150,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"This, I said in my heart, is the hour of life and of pleasure."

36155,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Speak, O desolate city! Speak, O silence in sadness!"
36156,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Where is she that I loved in my strength, that spoke to my soul?"
36157,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?

36159,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36160,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Speak, thou soul of my soul, for rage in my heart is kindled."
36161,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Tell me, where didst thou flee in the day of destruction and fear?"
36162,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"See, my arms still enfold thee, enfolding thus all heaven,"

36164,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36165,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Thus in my grief I lamented. Then turn'd I from the window,"
36166,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Turn'd to the stair, and the open door, and the empty street,"
36167,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Crying aloud in my grief, for there was none to chide me,"
36168,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"None to mock my weakness, none to behold my tears."
36169,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36170,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Groping I went, as blind. I sought her house, my beloved's."
36171,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"There I stopp'd at the silent door, and listen'd and tried the"
36172,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),latch.
36173,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Love, I cried, dost thou slumber? This is no hour for slumber,"
36174,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"This is the hour of love, and love I bring in my hand."
36175,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36176,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"I knew the house, with its windows barr'd, and its leafless fig-tree,"
36177,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Climbing round by the doorstep, the only one in the street;"
36178,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),I knew where my hope had climb'd to its goal and there encircled
36179,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"All that those desolate walls once held, my beloved's heart."
36180,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36181,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),There in my grief she consoled me. She loved me when I loved not.
36182,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"She put her hand in my hand, and set her lips to my lips."
36183,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),She told me all her pain and show'd me all her trouble.

36186,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Love, thy eyes were like torches. They changed as I beheld them."

36188,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Love, if I loved not then, behold this hour thy vengeance;"
36189,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"This is the fruit of thy love and thee, the unwise grown wise."
36190,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36191,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Weeping strangled my voice. I call'd out, but none answer'd;"
36192,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Blindly the windows gazed back at me, dumbly the door;"
36193,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"See whom I love, who loved me, look'd not on my yearning,"
36194,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Gave me no more her hands to kiss, show'd me no more her soul."
36195,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),
36196,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Therefore the earth is dark to me, the sunlight blackness,"
36197,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Therefore I go in tears and alone, by night and day;"
36198,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Therefore I find no love in heaven, no light, no beauty,"

36209,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),"Which is a mystery to other men,"

36230,(IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE),On what poor stuff my manhood's dreams were fed
