45,ADVERTISEMENT.,"MY Booksellers inform'd me, lately, that several inquiries had been made"
46,ADVERTISEMENT.,"for _My Night-Gown and Slippers_,--but that every copy had been"
47,ADVERTISEMENT.,"sold;--they had been out of print these two years.--""Then publish them"
48,ADVERTISEMENT.,"again,"" said I, boldly,--(I print at my own risk)--and with an air of"
49,ADVERTISEMENT.,"triumph. Messrs. Cadell and Davies advise'd me to make additions.--""The"
50,ADVERTISEMENT.,"_Work_ is, really, too short,"" said Messrs. Cadell and Davies,--""I wish,"
51,ADVERTISEMENT.,"gentlemen,"" return'd I, ""my readers were of your opinion.""--""I protest,"
52,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Sir,"" said they, (and they asserted it, both together, with great"
53,ADVERTISEMENT.,"emphasis,) ""you have but _Three Tales_.""--I told them, carelessly, it"
54,ADVERTISEMENT.,"was enough for the greatest _Bashaw_, among modern poets, and wish'd"
55,ADVERTISEMENT.,"them a good morning. When a man, as Sterne observes, ""can extricate"
56,ADVERTISEMENT.,"himself with an _equivoque_, in such an unequal match,""--(and two"
57,ADVERTISEMENT.,"booksellers to one poet are tremendous odds)--""he is not ill off;""--but"
58,ADVERTISEMENT.,"reflecting a little, as I went home, I began to think my pun was a vile"
59,ADVERTISEMENT.,"one,--and did not assist me, one jot, in my argument;--and, now I have"
60,ADVERTISEMENT.,"put it upon paper, it appears viler still;--it is execrable.--So, without"
61,ADVERTISEMENT.,"much further reasoning, I sat down to rhyming;--rhyming, as the reader"
62,ADVERTISEMENT.,"will see, in open defiance of _all reason_,--except the reasons of"
63,ADVERTISEMENT.,Messrs. Cadell and Davies.--
64,ADVERTISEMENT.,
65,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Thus you have _My Night-Gown and Slippers_, with _Additions_, converted"
66,ADVERTISEMENT.,to _Broad Grins_;--and 'tis well if they may not end in _Wide Yawns_ at
67,ADVERTISEMENT.,"last! Should this be the case, gentle Reviewers, do not, ungratefully,"
68,ADVERTISEMENT.,"attempt to break my sleep, (_you will find it labour lost_) because I"
69,ADVERTISEMENT.,have contributed to your's.

103,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"TOM, DICK, and WILL, were little known to Fame;--"
104,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,No matter;--
105,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"But to the Ale-house, oftentimes, they came,"
106,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,To chatter.
107,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
108,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,It was the custom of these three
109,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,To sit up late;
110,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And, o'er the embers of the Ale-house fire,"
111,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"When steadier customers retire,"
112,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"The choice _Triumviri_, d'ye see,"
113,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Held a debate.
114,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
115,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Held a debate?--On politicks, no doubt."
116,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Not so;--they care'd not who was in,"
117,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"No, not a pin;--"
118,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Nor who was out.
119,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
120,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,All their discourse on modern Poets ran;
121,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,For in the Muses was their sole delight;--
122,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"They talk'd of such, and such, and such a man;"
123,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Of those who could, and those who could not write."
124,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
125,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,It cost them very little pains
126,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"To count the modern Poets, who had brains."
127,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,'Twas a small difficulty;--'twasn't any;
128,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,They were so few:
129,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,But to cast up the scores of men
130,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Who wield a stump they call a pen,"
131,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Lord! they had much to do,--"
132,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,They were so many!
133,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
134,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Buoy'd on a sea of fancy, Genius rises,"
135,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,And like the rare Leviathan surprises;
136,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,But the _small fry_ of scribblers!--tiny souls!
137,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,They wriggle thro' the mud in shoals.
138,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
139,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,It would have raise'd a smile to see the faces
140,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"They made, and the ridiculous grimaces,"
141,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"At many an author, as they overhaul'd him."
142,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"They gave no quarter to a calf,"
143,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Blown up with puff, and paragraph;"
144,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"But, if they found him bad, they maul'd him."
145,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
146,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"On modern Dramatists they fell,"
147,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Pounce, _vi et armis_--tooth and nail--pell mell."
148,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"They call'd them Carpenters, and Smugglers;"
149,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Filching their incidents from ancient hoards,"
150,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And knocking them together, like deal boards:"
151,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,And Jugglers;
152,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Who all the town's attention fix,"
153,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"By making--Plays?--No, Sir, by making _tricks_."
154,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
155,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,The Versifiers--Heaven defend us!
156,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,They play'd the very devil with their rhymes.
157,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,They hope'd Apollo a new set would send us;
158,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And then, invidiously enough,"
159,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Place'd modish verse, which they call'd stuff,"
160,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Against the writing of the elder times.
161,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
162,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"To say the truth, a modern versifier"
163,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Clap'd cheek by jowl
164,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"With Pope, with Dryden, and with Prior,"
165,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Would look most scurvily, upon my soul!"
166,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
167,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"For Novels, should their critick hints succeed,"
168,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,The Misses might fare better when they took 'em;
169,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"But it would fare extremely ill, indeed,"
170,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,With gentle _Messieurs Lane_ and _Hookham_.
171,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
172,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""A Novel, now,"" says WILL, ""is nothing more"
173,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Than an old castle,--and a creaking door,--"
174,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,A distant hovel;--
175,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Clanking of chains--a gallery--a light,--"
176,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Old armour--and a phantom all in white,--"
177,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And there's a Novel!"""

180,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
181,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Scourge me such catch-penny inditers"
182,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Out of the land,"" quoth WILL--rousing in passion--"
183,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""And fy upon the readers of such writers,"
184,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Who bring them into fashion!"""
185,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
186,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"WILL rose in declamation. ""'Tis the bane,"""
187,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Says he, ""of youth;--'tis the perdition:"
188,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,It fills a giddy female brain
189,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"With vice, romance, lust, terror, pain,--"
190,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,With superstition.
191,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
192,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Were I Pastor in a boarding-school,"
193,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"I'd quash such books _in toto_;--if I couldn't,"
194,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Let me but catch one Miss that broke my rule,"
195,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"I'd flog her soundly; damme if I wouldn't."""
196,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
197,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"WILLIAM, 'tis plain, was getting in a rage;"
198,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"But, Thomas dryly said,--for he was cool--"
199,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""I think no gentleman would mend the age"
200,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"By flogging Ladies at a Boarding-school."""
201,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
202,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"DICK knock'd the ashes from his pipe,"
203,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And said, ""Friend WILL,"
204,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,You give the Novels a fair wipe;
205,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"But still,"
206,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"While you, my friend, with passion run 'em down,"
207,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,They're in the hands of all the town.
208,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
209,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""The reason's plain,"" proceeded DICK,"
210,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""And simply thus--"
211,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Taste, over-glutted, grows deprave'd, and sick,"
212,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,And needs a _stimulus_.
213,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
214,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Time was,--(when honest Fielding writ)--"
215,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Tales full of Nature, Character, and Wit,"
216,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Were reckon'd most delicious boil'd and roast:
217,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"But stomachs are so cloy'd with novel-feeding,"
218,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Folks get a vitiated taste in reading,"
219,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And want that strong provocative, a Ghost."
220,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
221,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Or, to come nearer,"
222,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,And put the case a little clearer:--
223,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Mind, just like bodies, suffer enervation,"
224,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,By too much use;
225,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And sink into a state of relaxation,"
226,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,With long abuse.
227,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
228,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Now, a Romance, with reading Debauchees,"
229,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Rouses their torpid powers when Nature fails;
230,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,And all these Legendary Tales
231,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Are, to a worn-out mind, Cantharides."
232,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
233,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""But how to cure the evil?"" you will say:"
234,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""My _Recipe_ is,--laughing it away."
235,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
236,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Lay bare the weak farrago of those men"
237,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"Who fabricate such visionary schemes,"
238,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"As if the night-mare rode upon their pen,"
239,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,And trouble'd all their ink with hideous dreams.
240,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
241,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""For instance--when a solemn Ghost stalks in,"
242,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"And, thro' a mystick tale is busy,"
243,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Strip me the Gentleman into his skin--
244,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,What is he?
245,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
246,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Truly, ridiculous enough:"
247,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,Mere trash;--and very childish stuff.
248,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,
249,MY NIGHT-GOWN AND SLIPPERS,"""Draw but a Ghost, or Fiend, _of low degree_,"

261,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
262,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Here Silence reign'd, with lips of glue,"
263,THE WATER-FIENDS.,And undisturb'd maintain'd her law;

276,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
277,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Swift whirl the wheels.--He's gone.--A Rose
278,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Remains behind, whose virgin look,"
279,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Unseen, must blush in wintry snows,"
280,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Sweet, beauteous blossom!----'twas the Cook!"

283,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Maid of the Moor! thy charms demand:
284,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Eels might be proud to lose their coat,"
285,THE WATER-FIENDS.,If skinn'd by Molly Dumpling's hand.
286,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
287,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Long had the fair one sat alone,"
288,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Had none remain'd save only she;--
289,THE WATER-FIENDS.,She by herself had been--if one
290,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Had not been left, for company."
291,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
292,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"'Twas a tall youth, whose cheek's clear hue,"
293,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Was tinge'd with health and manly toil;--
294,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Cabbage he sow'd; and, when it grew,"
295,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"He always cut it off, to boil."
296,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
297,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Oft would he cry, ""Delve, Delve the hole!"
298,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"And prune the tree, and trim the root!"
299,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"And stick the wig upon the pole,"
300,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"To scare the sparrows from the fruit!"""
301,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
302,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"A small, mute favourite, by day,"
303,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Follow'd his step; where'er he wheels
304,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"His barrow round the garden gay,"
305,THE WATER-FIENDS.,A bob-tail cur is at his heels.
306,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
307,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Ah, man! the brute creation see!"
308,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Thy constancy oft needs the spur!
309,THE WATER-FIENDS.,While lessons of fidelity
310,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Are found in every bob-tail cur.
311,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
312,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Hard toil'd the youth, so fresh and strong,"
313,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"While Bobtail in his face would look,"
314,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"And mark'd his master troll the song,--"
315,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"""Sweet Molly Dumpling! Oh, thou Cook!"""
316,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
317,THE WATER-FIENDS.,For thus he sung:--while Cupid smile'd;--
318,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Please'd that the Gard'ner own'd his dart,"
319,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Which prune'd his passions, running wild,"
320,THE WATER-FIENDS.,And grafted true-love on his heart.
321,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
322,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Maid of the Moor! his love return!
323,THE WATER-FIENDS.,True love ne'er tints the cheek with shame:
324,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"When Gard'ners' hearts, like hot-beds, burn,"
325,THE WATER-FIENDS.,A Cook may surely feed the flame.
326,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
327,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Ah! not averse from love was she;
328,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Tho' pure as Heaven's snowy flake;
329,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Both love'd: and tho' a Gard'ner he,"
330,THE WATER-FIENDS.,He knew not what it was to _rake_.
331,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
332,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Cold blows the blast:--the night's obscure:
333,THE WATER-FIENDS.,The mansion's crazy wainscots crack:
334,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"No star appear'd:--and all the Moor,"
335,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Like ev'ry other Moor,--was black."
336,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
337,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Alone, pale, trembling, near the fire,"
338,THE WATER-FIENDS.,The lovely Molly Dumpling sat;
339,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Much did she fear, and much admire"
340,THE WATER-FIENDS.,What Thomas Gard'ner could be at.
341,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
342,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"List'ning, her hand supports her chin;"
343,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"But, ah! no foot is heard to stir:"
344,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"He comes not, from the garden, in;"
345,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Nor he, nor little bobtail cur."
346,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
347,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"They cannot come, sweet maid! to thee;"
348,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Flesh, both of cur and man, is grass!"
349,THE WATER-FIENDS.,And what's impossible can't be;
350,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"And never, never, comes to pass!"
351,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
352,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"She paces thro' the hall antique,"
353,THE WATER-FIENDS.,To call her Thomas from his toil;
354,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Opes the huge door;--the hinges creak;
355,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Because the hinges wanted oil.
356,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
357,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Thrice, on the threshold of the hall,"
358,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"She ""Thomas!"" cried, with many a sob;"
359,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"And thrice on Bobtail did she call,"
360,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Exclaiming, sweetly,--""Bob! Bob! Bob!"""
361,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
362,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"Vain maid! a Gard'ner's corpse, 'tis said,"
363,THE WATER-FIENDS.,In answers can but ill succeed;
364,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"And dogs that hear when they are dead,"
365,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Are very cunning Dogs indeed!
366,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
367,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Back thro' the hall she bent her way;
368,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"All, all was solitude around!"
369,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"The candle shed a feeble ray,----"
370,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Tho' a large mould of four to th' pound.
371,THE WATER-FIENDS.,
372,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Full closely to the fire she drew;
373,THE WATER-FIENDS.,Adown her cheek a salt tear stole;
374,THE WATER-FIENDS.,"When, lo! a coffin out there flew,"
375,THE WATER-FIENDS.,And in her apron burnt a hole!

737,PART FIRST.,"Homeward he bent his course, to wreath 'em;"
738,PART FIRST.,"And in his Castle, near fair Norwich town,"
739,PART FIRST.,"Glutted with glory, he sat down,"
740,PART FIRST.,"In perfect solitude, beneath 'em."
741,PART FIRST.,
742,PART FIRST.,"Now, sitting under Laurels, Heroes say,"
743,PART FIRST.,"Gives grace, and dignity--and so it may--"
744,PART FIRST.,When men have done campaigning;
745,PART FIRST.,"But, certainly, these gentlemen must own"
746,PART FIRST.,"That sitting under Laurels, quite alone,"
747,PART FIRST.,Is much more dignified than entertaining.
748,PART FIRST.,
749,PART FIRST.,"Pious Æneas, who, in his narration"
750,PART FIRST.,"Of his own prowess, felt so great a charm;--"
751,PART FIRST.,"(For, tho' he feign'd great grief in the relation,"
752,PART FIRST.,He made the story longer than your arm;[4])
753,PART FIRST.,
754,PART FIRST.,Pious Æneas no more pleasure knew
755,PART FIRST.,Than did our Knight--who could he pious too--
756,PART FIRST.,"In telling his exploits, and martial brawls:"
757,PART FIRST.,But pious _Thomas_ had no Dido near him--
758,PART FIRST.,"No Queen--King, Lord, nor Commoner to hear him--"
759,PART FIRST.,So he was force'd to tell them to the walls:
760,PART FIRST.,
761,PART FIRST.,"And to his Castle walls, in solemn guise,"
762,PART FIRST.,"The knight, full often, did soliloquize:--"
763,PART FIRST.,
764,PART FIRST.,"For ""Walls have ears,"" Sir Thomas had been told;"
765,PART FIRST.,"Yet thought the tedious hours would seem much shorter,"
766,PART FIRST.,"If, now and then, a tale he could unfold"
767,PART FIRST.,"To ears of flesh and blood, not stone and mortar."
768,PART FIRST.,
769,PART FIRST.,"At length, his old _Castellum_ grew so dull,"
770,PART FIRST.,That legions of Blue Devils seize'd the Knight;
771,PART FIRST.,Megrim invested his belaurell'd skull;
772,PART FIRST.,Spleen laid embargoes on his appetite;
773,PART FIRST.,
774,PART FIRST.,"Till, thro' the day-time, he was haunted, wholly,"
775,PART FIRST.,"By all the imps of ""loathed Melancholy!""--"
776,PART FIRST.,"Heaven keep her, and her imps, for ever, from us!--"
777,PART FIRST.,"An Incubus,[5] whene'er he went to bed,"
778,PART FIRST.,"Sat on his stomach, like a lump of lead,"
779,PART FIRST.,Making unseemly faces at Sir Thomas.
780,PART FIRST.,
781,PART FIRST.,Plagues such as these might make a Parson swear;
782,PART FIRST.,"Sir Thomas being but a Layman,"
783,PART FIRST.,"Swore, very roundly, _à la militaire_,"
784,PART FIRST.,"Or, rather, (from vexation) like a Drayman:"
785,PART FIRST.,
786,PART FIRST.,"Damning his Walls, out of all line and level;"
787,PART FIRST.,Sinking his drawbridges and moats;
788,PART FIRST.,Wishing that he were cutting throats--
789,PART FIRST.,And they were at the devil.
790,PART FIRST.,
791,PART FIRST.,"""What's to be done,"" Sir Thomas said one day,"
792,PART FIRST.,"""To drive _Ennui_ away?"
793,PART FIRST.,How is the evil to be parried?
794,PART FIRST.,What can remind me of my former life?--
795,PART FIRST.,"Those happy days I spent in noise and strife!"""
796,PART FIRST.,"The last word struck him;--""Zounds!"" says he,"
797,PART FIRST.,"""a Wife!""--"
798,PART FIRST.,And so he married.
799,PART FIRST.,
800,PART FIRST.,Muse! regulate your pace;--
801,PART FIRST.,"Restrain, awhile, your frisking, and your giggling!"
802,PART FIRST.,Here is a stately Lady in the case:
803,PART FIRST.,"We mustn't, now, be fidgetting, and niggling."
804,PART FIRST.,
805,PART FIRST.,"O God of Love! Urchin of spite, and play!"
806,PART FIRST.,"Deserter, oft, from saffron Hymen's quarters;"
807,PART FIRST.,"His torch bedimming, as thou runn'st away,"
808,PART FIRST.,Till half his Votaries become his Martyrs!
809,PART FIRST.,
810,PART FIRST.,"Sly, wandering God! whose frolick arrows pass"
811,PART FIRST.,"Thro' hearts of Potentates, and Prentice-boys;"
812,PART FIRST.,"Who mark'st with Milkmaids' forms, the tell-tale grass,"
813,PART FIRST.,And make'st the fruitful Prude repent her joys!
814,PART FIRST.,
815,PART FIRST.,"Drop me one feather, from thy wanton wing,"
816,PART FIRST.,Young God of dimples! in thy roguish flight;
817,PART FIRST.,"And let thy Poet catch it, now, to sing"
818,PART FIRST.,The beauty of the Dame who won the Knight!
819,PART FIRST.,

861,PART FIRST.,
862,PART FIRST.,"Close to a Chapel, near the Castle-gates,"
863,PART FIRST.,Dwelt certain stickers in the Devil's skirts;
864,PART FIRST.,"Who, with prodigious fervour, shave their pates,"
865,PART FIRST.,And shew a most religious scorn for shirts.
866,PART FIRST.,
867,PART FIRST.,Their House's sole Endowment was our Knight's:--
868,PART FIRST.,"Thither an Abbot, and twelve Friars, retreating,"
869,PART FIRST.,"Conquer'd (sage, pious men!) their appetites"
870,PART FIRST.,With that infallible specifick--eating.
871,PART FIRST.,
872,PART FIRST.,"'Twould seem, since tenanted by holy Friars,"
873,PART FIRST.,That Peace and Harmony reign'd here eternally;--
874,PART FIRST.,Whoever told you so were cursed liars;--
875,PART FIRST.,The holy Friars quarrell'd most infernally.
876,PART FIRST.,
877,PART FIRST.,Not a day past
878,PART FIRST.,Without some schism among these heavenly lodgers;
879,PART FIRST.,But none of their dissensions seem'd to last
880,PART FIRST.,So long as Friar John's and Friar Roger's.
881,PART FIRST.,
882,PART FIRST.,"I have been very accurate in my researches,"
883,PART FIRST.,And find this Convent (truce with _whys_ and _hows_)
884,PART FIRST.,Kept in a constant ferment with the _rows_
885,PART FIRST.,Of these two quarrelsome fat sons of Churches.
886,PART FIRST.,
887,PART FIRST.,"But when Sir Thomas went to his devotions,"
888,PART FIRST.,"Proceeding thro' their Cloister with his Bride,"
889,PART FIRST.,"You never could have dream'd of their commotions,"
890,PART FIRST.,The stiff-rump'd rascals look'd so sanctified:
891,PART FIRST.,
892,PART FIRST.,And it became the custom of the Knight
893,PART FIRST.,To go to matins every day;
894,PART FIRST.,"He jogg'd his Bride, as soon as it was light,"
895,PART FIRST.,"Crying, ""my dear, 'tis time for us to pray.""--"
896,PART FIRST.,
897,PART FIRST.,"This custom he establish'd, very soon,"
898,PART FIRST.,After his honey-moon.
899,PART FIRST.,
900,PART FIRST.,Wives of this age might think his zeal surprising;
901,PART FIRST.,"But much his pious lady did it please,"
902,PART FIRST.,"To see her Husband, every morning, rising,"
903,PART FIRST.,"And going, instantly, upon his knees."
904,PART FIRST.,
905,PART FIRST.,"Never, I ween,"
906,PART FIRST.,"In any person's recollection,"
907,PART FIRST.,"Was such a couple seen,"
908,PART FIRST.,For genuflection!
909,PART FIRST.,
910,PART FIRST.,Making as great a drudgery of prayer
911,PART FIRST.,"As humble Curates are oblige'd to do,--"
912,PART FIRST.,"Whose labour, wo the while! scarce buys them cassocks;"
913,PART FIRST.,"And, every morning, whether foul or fair,"
914,PART FIRST.,"Sir Thomas and the Dame were in their pew,"
915,PART FIRST.,"Craw-thumping, upon hassocks."
916,PART FIRST.,
917,PART FIRST.,It could not otherwise befall
918,PART FIRST.,"(Sir Thomas, and his Wife, this course pursuing,)"
919,PART FIRST.,"But that the Lady, affable to all,"
920,PART FIRST.,"Should greet the Friars, on her way"
921,PART FIRST.,"To matins, as she met them, every day,"
922,PART FIRST.,"_Good morninging_, and _how d'ye doing_:"
923,PART FIRST.,
924,PART FIRST.,"Now nodding to this Friar, now to that,"
925,PART FIRST.,As thro' the Cloister she was wont to trip;
926,PART FIRST.,"Stopping, sometimes, to have a little chat,"
927,PART FIRST.,"On casual topicks, with the holy brothers;--"
928,PART FIRST.,"So condescending was her Ladyship,"
929,PART FIRST.,"To Roger, John, and all the others."
930,PART FIRST.,
931,PART FIRST.,All this was natural enough
932,PART FIRST.,To any female of urbanity;--
933,PART FIRST.,But holy men are made of as frail stuff
934,PART FIRST.,As all the lighter sons of Vanity!--
935,PART FIRST.,
936,PART FIRST.,"And these her Ladyship's chaste condescensions,"
937,PART FIRST.,In Friar John bred damnable desire;
938,PART FIRST.,"Heterodox, unclean intentions;--"
939,PART FIRST.,Abominable in a Friar!
940,PART FIRST.,
941,PART FIRST.,"Whene'er she greeted him, his gills grew red,"
942,PART FIRST.,While she was quite unconscious of the matter;--
943,PART FIRST.,"But he, the beast! was casting sheeps-eyes at her,"
944,PART FIRST.,Out of his bullock-head.
945,PART FIRST.,
946,PART FIRST.,"That coxcombs _were_ and _are_, I need not give,"
947,PART FIRST.,"Nor take the trouble, now, to prove;"
948,PART FIRST.,"Nor that those dead, like many, now, who live,"
949,PART FIRST.,"Have thought a Lady's condescension, love."
950,PART FIRST.,
951,PART FIRST.,This happen'd with fat Friar John!--
952,PART FIRST.,"Monastick Coxcomb! amorous, and gummy;"
953,PART FIRST.,Fill'd with conceit up to his very brim!--
954,PART FIRST.,"He thought his guts and garbage doated on,"
955,PART FIRST.,"By a fair Dame, whose Husband was to _him_"
956,PART FIRST.,Hyperion to a mummy.
957,PART FIRST.,
958,PART FIRST.,"Burning with flames the Lady never knew,"
959,PART FIRST.,"Hotter and heavier than toasted cheese,"
960,PART FIRST.,He sent her a much warmer _billet-doux_
961,PART FIRST.,Than Abelard e'er writ to Eloïse.
962,PART FIRST.,
963,PART FIRST.,"But whether Friar John's fat shape and face,"
964,PART FIRST.,"Tho' pleading both together,"
965,PART FIRST.,"Were sorry advocates, in such a case;--"
966,PART FIRST.,"Or, whether"
967,PART FIRST.,"He marr'd his hopes, by suffering his pen"
968,PART FIRST.,With too much fervour to display 'em;--
969,PART FIRST.,"As very tender Nurses, now and then,"
970,PART FIRST.,"Cuddle their Children, till they overlay 'em;--"
971,PART FIRST.,
972,PART FIRST.,"'Twas plain, his pray'r to decorate the brows"
973,PART FIRST.,"Of good Sir Thomas was so far from granted,"
974,PART FIRST.,"That the Dame went, directly, to her spouse,"
975,PART FIRST.,And told him what the filthy Friar wanted.
976,PART FIRST.,
977,PART FIRST.,"Think, Reader, think! if thou hast ta'en, for life,"
978,PART FIRST.,"A partner to thy bed, for worse or better,"
979,PART FIRST.,"Think what Sir Thomas felt, when his chaste wife"
980,PART FIRST.,"Brandish'd, before his eyes, the Friar's letter!"
981,PART FIRST.,
982,PART FIRST.,[Illustration]
983,PART FIRST.,
984,PART FIRST.,"He felt, Sir,--Zounds!--"
985,PART FIRST.,"Yes, Zounds! I say, Sir,--for it makes me swear--"
986,PART FIRST.,More torture than he suffer'd from the wounds
987,PART FIRST.,"He got among the French, in France;--"
988,PART FIRST.,Not that I take upon me to advance
989,PART FIRST.,The knight was ever wounded there.
990,PART FIRST.,
991,PART FIRST.,"Think gravely, Sir, I pray:--fancy the Knight--"
992,PART FIRST.,('Tis quite a Picture)--with his heart's delight!
993,PART FIRST.,"Fancy you see his virtuous Lady stand,"
994,PART FIRST.,Holding the Friar's foulness in her hand!--
995,PART FIRST.,
996,PART FIRST.,"How should Sir Thomas, Sir, behave?"
997,PART FIRST.,"Why bounce, and sputter, surely, like a squib:--"
998,PART FIRST.,"You would have done the same, Sir, if a knave,"
999,PART FIRST.,"A frouzy Friar, meddle'd with your Rib."
1000,PART FIRST.,
1001,PART FIRST.,His bosom almost burst with ire
1002,PART FIRST.,Against the Friar;
1003,PART FIRST.,
1004,PART FIRST.,Rage gave his face an apoplectick hue;
1005,PART FIRST.,"His cheeks turn'd purple, and his nose turn'd blue;"
1006,PART FIRST.,He swore with this mock Saint he'd soon be even;--
1007,PART FIRST.,"He'd have him flay'd, like Saint Bartholomew;--"
1008,PART FIRST.,"And, now again, he'd have him stone'd, like Stephen."
1009,PART FIRST.,
1010,PART FIRST.,"But, ""_Ira furor brevis est_,"""
1011,PART FIRST.,"As Horace, quaintly, has express'd;--"
1012,PART FIRST.,
1013,PART FIRST.,"Therefore the Knight, finding his foam and froth"
1014,PART FIRST.,"Work thro' the bung-hole of his mouth, like beer,"
1015,PART FIRST.,"Pull'd out the vent-peg of his wrath,"
1016,PART FIRST.,To let the stream of his revenge run clear:
1017,PART FIRST.,
1018,PART FIRST.,"Debating, with himself, what mode might suit him,"
1019,PART FIRST.,To trounce the rogue who wanted to cornute him.
1020,PART FIRST.,
1021,PART FIRST.,"First, an attack against his Foe he plann'd,"
1022,PART FIRST.,"Learn'd in the Field, where late he fought so felly;"
1023,PART FIRST.,"That is--to march up, bravely, sword in hand,"
1024,PART FIRST.,And run the Friar thro' his holy belly.
1025,PART FIRST.,
1026,PART FIRST.,"At last, his better judgment did declare--"
1027,PART FIRST.,Seeing his honour would as little shine
1028,PART FIRST.,"By sticking Friars, as by killing swine--"
1029,PART FIRST.,"To circumvent him, by a _ruse de guerre_:"
1030,PART FIRST.,
1031,PART FIRST.,"And, as the project ripen'd in his head,"
1032,PART FIRST.,Thus to his virtuous Wife he said:
1033,PART FIRST.,
1034,PART FIRST.,"""Now sit thee down, my Lady bright!"
1035,PART FIRST.,And list thy Lord's desire;
1036,PART FIRST.,"An assignation thou shalt write,"
1037,PART FIRST.,Beshrew me! to the Friar.
1038,PART FIRST.,
1039,PART FIRST.,"""Aread him, at the midnight hour,"
1040,PART FIRST.,"In silent sort to go,"
1041,PART FIRST.,"And bide thy coming, in the Bower--"
1042,PART FIRST.,For there do Crabsticks grow.
1043,PART FIRST.,
1044,PART FIRST.,"""He shall not tarry long;--for why?"
1045,PART FIRST.,"When _Twelve_ have striking done,"
1046,PART FIRST.,"Then, by the God of Gardens![7] I"
1047,PART FIRST.,"Will cudgel him till _One_."""
1048,PART FIRST.,
1049,PART FIRST.,The Lady wrote just what Sir Thomas told her;
1050,PART FIRST.,"For, it is no less strange than true,"
1051,PART FIRST.,"That Wives did, once, what Husbands bid them do;--"
1052,PART FIRST.,"Lord! how this World improves, as we grow older!"
1053,PART FIRST.,
1054,PART FIRST.,She name'd the midnight hour;--
1055,PART FIRST.,Telling the Friar to repair
1056,PART FIRST.,"To the sweet, secret Bower;--"
1057,PART FIRST.,But not a word of any crabsticks there.
1058,PART FIRST.,
1059,PART FIRST.,"Thus have I seen a liquorish, black rat,"
1060,PART FIRST.,"Lure'd by the Cook, to sniff, and smell her bacon;"
1061,PART FIRST.,"And, when he's eager for a bit of fat,"
1062,PART FIRST.,"Down goes a trap upon him, and he's taken."
1063,PART FIRST.,
1064,PART FIRST.,"A tiny Page,--for, formerly, a boy"
1065,PART FIRST.,Was a mere dunce who did not understand
1066,PART FIRST.,"The doctrines of Sir Pandarus, of Troy,--"
1067,PART FIRST.,"Slipp'd the Dame's note into the Friar's hand,"
1068,PART FIRST.,As he was walking in the cloister;
1069,PART FIRST.,"And, then, slipp'd off,--as silent as an oyster."
1070,PART FIRST.,
1071,PART FIRST.,The Friar read;--the Friar chuckle'd:--
1072,PART FIRST.,"For, now the Farce's unities were right:"
1073,PART FIRST.,"_Videlicet_--The Argument, a Cuckold;"
1074,PART FIRST.,"The Scene, a Bow'r; Time, Twelve o'clock, at night."
1075,PART FIRST.,
1076,PART FIRST.,"Blithe was fat John!--and, dreading no mishap,"
1077,PART FIRST.,"Stole, at the hour appointed, to the _trap_;"
1078,PART FIRST.,"But, so perfume'd, so musk'd, for the occasion,--"
1079,PART FIRST.,"His _tribute_ to the nose so like _invasion_,--"
1080,PART FIRST.,"You would have sworn, to smell him, 'twas no rat,"
1081,PART FIRST.,"But a dead, putrified, old civet-cat."
1082,PART FIRST.,
1083,PART FIRST.,"He reach'd the spot, anticipating blisses,"
1084,PART FIRST.,"Soft murmurs, melting sighs, and burning kisses,"
1085,PART FIRST.,"Trances of joy, and mingling of the souls;"
1086,PART FIRST.,"When, whack! Sir Thomas hit him on the joles."
1087,PART FIRST.,
1088,PART FIRST.,"Now, on his head it came, now on his face,"
1089,PART FIRST.,"His neck, and shoulders, arms, legs, breast, and back;"
1090,PART FIRST.,"In short, on almost every place"
1091,PART FIRST.,We read of in the Almanack.
1092,PART FIRST.,
1093,PART FIRST.,Blows rattle'd on him thick as hail;
1094,PART FIRST.,Making him rue the day that he was born;--
1095,PART FIRST.,"Sir Thomas plied his cudgel like a flail,"
1096,PART FIRST.,And thrash'd as if he had been thrashing corn.
1097,PART FIRST.,
1098,PART FIRST.,"At length, a thump,--(painful the facts, alas!"
1099,PART FIRST.,Truth urges us Historians to relate!)--
1100,PART FIRST.,"Took Friar John so smart athwart the pate,"
1101,PART FIRST.,It acted like a perfect _coup de grace_.
1102,PART FIRST.,
1103,PART FIRST.,"Whether it was a random shot,"
1104,PART FIRST.,"Or aim'd maliciously,--tho' Fame says _not_--"
1105,PART FIRST.,Certain his soul (the Knight so crack'd his crown)
1106,PART FIRST.,"Fled from his body; but which way it went,"
1107,PART FIRST.,"Or whether Friars' souls fly up, or down,"
1108,PART FIRST.,Remains a matter of nice argument.
1109,PART FIRST.,
1110,PART FIRST.,Points so abstruse I dare not dwell upon;
1111,PART FIRST.,"Enough, for me, his body is not gone;"
1112,PART FIRST.,

1177,PART THE SECOND.,This wight possess'd a quality most rare;--

1216,PART THE SECOND.,
1217,PART THE SECOND.,A Sleeper's nose is made on the same plan

1226,PART THE SECOND.,
1227,PART THE SECOND.,"The Man awoke, and goggle'd on his master;--"

1244,PART THE SECOND.,"But he reverse'd, in making himself smart,"
1245,PART THE SECOND.,"A Scotchman's toilet, altogether:"
1246,PART THE SECOND.,And merely clapp'd a cover on that part
1247,PART THE SECOND.,The Highlanders expose to wind and weather.
1248,PART THE SECOND.,
1249,PART THE SECOND.,They reach'd the bower where the Friar lay;
1250,PART THE SECOND.,"When, to his Man,"

1259,PART THE SECOND.,"""Odrabbit it! Sir Thomas! you don't say so!"""
1260,PART THE SECOND.,
1261,PART THE SECOND.,"Then, taking the huge Friar _per_ the hocks,"

1267,PART THE SECOND.,
1268,PART THE SECOND.,"Nay, I opine--let Fame say what it can--"
1269,PART THE SECOND.,"Of ancient vigour, (Fame is, oft, a Liar)"
1270,PART THE SECOND.,"That Milo was a pigmy to this Man,"
1271,PART THE SECOND.,And his fat Ox quite skinny to the Friar.
1272,PART THE SECOND.,
1273,PART THE SECOND.,"Besides,--I hold it in much doubt"
1274,PART THE SECOND.,If Roman graziers (should the truth come out)
1275,PART THE SECOND.,"Were, like the English, knowing in the matter;--"
1276,PART THE SECOND.,--I wouldn't breed my beast _more Romano_;--
1277,PART THE SECOND.,"For, I suspect, in fatt'ning they were dull,"
1278,PART THE SECOND.,"And when they made an ox out of a bull,"
1279,PART THE SECOND.,"They fed him ill,--and, then, he got no fatter"

2091,FOOTNOTES,"evidently intended, that _Moderns_ should believe he writ these"
2092,FOOTNOTES,love-verses almost immediately after his marriage; not only from the

2100,FOOTNOTES,"king only 9 years, 5 months, and 11 days) began his reign scarcely"
2101,FOOTNOTES,"13 years after the death of that Poet. Sir Thomas, then, must, at"
