41,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS,It sometimes happens that there are people who do not know that authors
42,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS,are protected by copyright laws. A publisher once cited to me an

44,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS,"that she loved and admired, without asking permission of any one. Her"
45,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS,annoyance was boundless when she found that she had no right to the

117,PREFACE,PREFACE
118,PREFACE,
119,PREFACE,
120,PREFACE,Is this another collection of stupid poems that children cannot use?
121,PREFACE,Will they look hopelessly through this volume for poems that suit them?
122,PREFACE,"Will they say despairingly, “This is too long,” and “That is too hard,”"
123,PREFACE,and “I don’t like that because it is not interesting”?
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,Are there three or four pleasing poems and are all the rest put in to
126,PREFACE,"fill up the book? Nay, verily! The poems in this collection are those"
127,PREFACE,"that children love. With the exception of seven, they are short enough"
128,PREFACE,for children to commit to memory without wearying themselves or losing
129,PREFACE,"interest in the poem. If one boy learns “The Overland Mail,” or “The"
130,PREFACE,"Recruit,” or “Wynken, Blynken, and Nod,” or “The Song in Camp,” or “Old"
131,PREFACE,"Ironsides,” or “I Have a Little Shadow,” or “The Tournament,” or “The"
132,PREFACE,"Duel,” nine boys out of ten will be eager to follow him. I know because"
133,PREFACE,I have tried it a dozen times. Every boy loves “Paul Revere’s Ride”
134,PREFACE,"(alas! I have not been able to include it), and is ambitious to learn"
135,PREFACE,"it, but only boys having a quick memory will persevere to the end. Shall"
136,PREFACE,the slower boy be deprived of the pleasure of reading the whole poem and
137,PREFACE,getting its inspiring sentiment and learning as many stanzas as his mind
138,PREFACE,"will take? No, indeed. Half of such a poem is better than none. Let the"
139,PREFACE,slow boy learn and recite as many stanzas as he can and the boy of quick
140,PREFACE,memory follow him up with the rest. It does not help the slow boy’s
141,PREFACE,memory to keep it down entirely or deprive it of its smaller activity
142,PREFACE,because he cannot learn the whole. Some people will invariably give the
143,PREFACE,slow child a very short poem. It is often better to divide a long poem
144,PREFACE,"among the children, letting each child learn a part. The sustained"
145,PREFACE,"interest of a long poem is worth while. “The Merman,” “The Battle of"
146,PREFACE,"Ivry,” “Horatius at the Bridge,” “Krinken,” “The Skeleton in Armour,”"
147,PREFACE,“The Raven” and “Hervé Riel” may all profitably be learned that way.
148,PREFACE,"Nevertheless, the child enjoys most the poem that is just long enough,"
149,PREFACE,"and there is much to be said in favour of the selection that is adapted,"
150,PREFACE,"in length, to the average mind; for the child hesitates in the presence"
151,PREFACE,of quantity rather than in the presence of subtle thought. I make claim
152,PREFACE,for this collection that it is made up of poems that the majority of
153,PREFACE,children will learn of their own free will. There are people who believe
154,PREFACE,"that in the matter of learning poetry there is no “_ought_,” but this is"
155,PREFACE,"a false belief. There is a _duty_, even there; for every American"
156,PREFACE,citizen _ought_ to know the great national songs that keep alive the
157,PREFACE,"spirit of patriotism. Children should build for their future--and get,"
158,PREFACE,"while they are children, what only the fresh imagination of the child"
159,PREFACE,can assimilate.
160,PREFACE,
161,PREFACE,They should store up an untold wealth of heroic sentiment; they should
162,PREFACE,acquire the habit of carrying a literary quality in their conversation;
163,PREFACE,they should carry a heart full of the fresh and delightful associations
164,PREFACE,"and memories, connected with poetry hours to brighten mature years. They"
165,PREFACE,should develop their memories while they have memories to develop.
166,PREFACE,
167,PREFACE,Will the boy who took every poetry hour for a whole school year to learn
168,PREFACE,"“Henry of Navarre” ever regret it, or will the children who listened to"
169,PREFACE,it? No. It was fresh every week and they brought fresh interest in
170,PREFACE,listening. The boy will always love it because he used to love it. There
171,PREFACE,"were boys who scrambled for the right to recite “The Tournament,” “The"
172,PREFACE,"Charge of the Light Brigade,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and so on. The"
173,PREFACE,boy who was first to reach the front had the privilege. The triumph of
174,PREFACE,getting the chance to recite added to the zest of it. Will they ever
175,PREFACE,forget it?
176,PREFACE,
177,PREFACE,"I know Lowell’s “The Finding of the Lyre.” Attention, Sir Knights! See"
178,PREFACE,who can learn it first as I say it to you. But I find that I have
179,PREFACE,"forgotten a line of it, so you may open your books and teach it to me."
180,PREFACE,"Now, I can recite every word of it. How much of it can you repeat from"
181,PREFACE,memory? One boy can say it all. Nearly every child has learned the most
182,PREFACE,"of it. Now, it will be easy for you to learn it alone. And Memory, the"
183,PREFACE,"Goddess Beautiful, will henceforth go with you to recall this happy"
184,PREFACE,hour.

2208,THE FROST.,poem puts his merry pranks to the front and prepares the way for
2209,THE FROST.,science to give him a true analysis.
2210,THE FROST.,
2211,THE FROST.,"The Frost looked forth, one still, clear night,"
2212,THE FROST.,"And whispered, “Now I shall be out of sight;"
2213,THE FROST.,"So through the valley and over the height,"

2220,THE FROST.,Then he flew to the mountain and powdered its crest;
2221,THE FROST.,"He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed"
2222,THE FROST.,In diamond beads--and over the breast
2223,THE FROST.,Of the quivering lake he spread
2224,THE FROST.,"A coat of mail, that it need not fear"
2225,THE FROST.,The downward point of many a spear
2226,THE FROST.,"That hung on its margin far and near,"

2228,THE FROST.,
2229,THE FROST.,"He went to the windows of those who slept,"
2230,THE FROST.,"And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;"
2231,THE FROST.,"Wherever he breathed, wherever he slept,"
2232,THE FROST.,By the light of the moon were seen
2233,THE FROST.,Most beautiful things--there were flowers and trees;

2237,THE FROST.,
2238,THE FROST.,But he did one thing that was hardly fair;

2241,THE FROST.,"“Now just to set them a-thinking,"

2308,LITTLE BILLEE.,
2309,LITTLE BILLEE.,"So Billy went up to the main-topgallant mast,"
2310,LITTLE BILLEE.,And down he fell on his bended knee.

3336,LADY CLARE.,Girls always love “Lady Clare” and “The Lord of Burleigh.” They like to
3337,LADY CLARE.,think that it is enough to be a splendid woman without title or wealth.
3338,LADY CLARE.,"They want to be loved, if they are loved at all, for their good hearts"
3339,LADY CLARE.,and graces of mind. Tennyson (1809-92) makes this point repeatedly
3340,LADY CLARE.,through his poems.
3341,LADY CLARE.,
3342,LADY CLARE.,It was the time when lilies blow
3343,LADY CLARE.,And clouds are highest up in air;
3344,LADY CLARE.,Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe
3345,LADY CLARE.,"To give his cousin, Lady Clare."
3346,LADY CLARE.,
3347,LADY CLARE.,I trow they did not part in scorn:
3348,LADY CLARE.,Lovers long-betroth’d were they:
3349,LADY CLARE.,They too will wed the morrow morn:
3350,LADY CLARE.,God’s blessing on the day!

3356,LADY CLARE.,
3357,LADY CLARE.,In there came old Alice the nurse;
3358,LADY CLARE.,Said: “Who was this that went from thee?”
3359,LADY CLARE.,"“It was my cousin,” said Lady Clare;"
3360,LADY CLARE.,“To-morrow he weds with me.”
3361,LADY CLARE.,
3362,LADY CLARE.,"“O God be thank’d!” said Alice the nurse,"
3363,LADY CLARE.,“That all comes round so just and fair:
3364,LADY CLARE.,"Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,"

3366,LADY CLARE.,
3367,LADY CLARE.,"“Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse,”"
3368,LADY CLARE.,"Said Lady Clare, “that ye speak so wild?”"
3369,LADY CLARE.,"“As God’s above,” said Alice the nurse,"
3370,LADY CLARE.,“I speak the truth: you are my child.

3372,LADY CLARE.,“The old Earl’s daughter died at my breast;
3373,LADY CLARE.,"I speak the truth, as I live by bread!"

3377,LADY CLARE.,"“Falsely, falsely have ye done,"

3381,LADY CLARE.,
3382,LADY CLARE.,"“Nay now, my child,” said Alice the nurse,"

3387,LADY CLARE.,"“If I’m a beggar born,” she said,"

3391,LADY CLARE.,
3392,LADY CLARE.,"“Nay now, my child,” said Alice the nurse,"
3393,LADY CLARE.,“But keep the secret all ye can.”
3394,LADY CLARE.,She said: “Not so: but I will know
3395,LADY CLARE.,If there be any faith in man.”
3396,LADY CLARE.,
3397,LADY CLARE.,"“Nay now, what faith?” said Alice the nurse,"
3398,LADY CLARE.,"“The man will cleave unto his right,”"
3399,LADY CLARE.,"“And he shall have it,” the lady replied,"
3400,LADY CLARE.,“Tho’ I should die to-night.”
3401,LADY CLARE.,
3402,LADY CLARE.,“Yet give one kiss to your mother dear!
3403,LADY CLARE.,"Alas! my child, I sinn’d for thee.”"

3407,LADY CLARE.,"“Yet here’s a kiss for my mother dear,"
3408,LADY CLARE.,"My mother dear, if this be so,"
3409,LADY CLARE.,"And lay your hand upon my head,"
3410,LADY CLARE.,"And bless me, mother, ere I go.”"
3411,LADY CLARE.,
3412,LADY CLARE.,"She clad herself in a russet gown,"
3413,LADY CLARE.,She was no longer Lady Clare:
3414,LADY CLARE.,"She went by dale, and she went by down,"
3415,LADY CLARE.,With a single rose in her hair.
3416,LADY CLARE.,
3417,LADY CLARE.,The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought
3418,LADY CLARE.,"Leapt up from where she lay,"
3419,LADY CLARE.,"Dropt her head in the maiden’s hand,"
3420,LADY CLARE.,And follow’d her all the way.
3421,LADY CLARE.,
3422,LADY CLARE.,Down stept Lord Ronald from his tower:
3423,LADY CLARE.,"“O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!"

3426,LADY CLARE.,
3427,LADY CLARE.,"“If I come drest like a village maid,"
3428,LADY CLARE.,I am but as my fortunes are:

3431,LADY CLARE.,
3432,LADY CLARE.,"“Play me no tricks,” said Lord Ronald,"
3433,LADY CLARE.,“For I am yours in word and in deed.
3434,LADY CLARE.,"Play me no tricks,” said Lord Ronald,"
3435,LADY CLARE.,“Your riddle is hard to read.”
3436,LADY CLARE.,
3437,LADY CLARE.,O and proudly stood she up!
3438,LADY CLARE.,Her heart within her did not fail:
3439,LADY CLARE.,"She look’d into Lord Ronald’s eyes,"
3440,LADY CLARE.,And told him all her nurse’s tale.
3441,LADY CLARE.,
3442,LADY CLARE.,He laugh’d a laugh of merry scorn:
3443,LADY CLARE.,He turn’d and kiss’d her where she stood:
3444,LADY CLARE.,“If you are not the heiress born?
3445,LADY CLARE.,"And I,” said he, “the next in blood--"
3446,LADY CLARE.,
3447,LADY CLARE.,"“If you are not the heiress born,"

5116,MARCO BOZZARIS.,
5117,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"At midnight, in his guarded tent,"
5118,MARCO BOZZARIS.,The Turk was dreaming of the hour
5119,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,"

5121,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"In dreams, through camp and court, he bore"
5122,MARCO BOZZARIS.,The trophies of a conqueror;
5123,MARCO BOZZARIS.,In dreams his song of triumph heard;
5124,MARCO BOZZARIS.,Then wore his monarch’s signet ring:

5126,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,"

5129,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"At midnight, in the forest shades,"
5130,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,"

5132,MARCO BOZZARIS.,Heroes in heart and hand.
5133,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"There had the Persian’s thousands stood,"
5134,MARCO BOZZARIS.,There had the glad earth drunk their blood
5135,MARCO BOZZARIS.,On old Platæa’s day;

5145,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"He woke--to die midst flame, and smoke,"
5146,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,"
5147,MARCO BOZZARIS.,And death-shots falling thick and fast
5148,MARCO BOZZARIS.,As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;

5161,MARCO BOZZARIS.,"His smile when rang their proud hurrah,"

5490,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5491,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"It was the schooner _Hesperus_,"
5492,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,That sailed the wintry sea;
5493,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"And the skipper had taken his little daughter,"
5494,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,To bear him company.
5495,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5496,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,"
5497,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Her cheeks like the dawn of day,"
5498,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds
5499,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,That ope in the month of May.

5501,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"The skipper he stood beside the helm,"
5502,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"His pipe was in his mouth,"
5503,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And he watched how the veering flaw did blow
5504,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"The smoke now west, now south."
5505,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5506,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Then up and spake an old sailor,"
5507,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Had sailed the Spanish Main,"
5508,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“I pray thee put into yonder port,"
5509,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,For I fear a hurricane.

5511,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“Last night the moon had a golden ring,"

5513,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"The skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe,"
5514,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And a scornful laugh laughed he.
5515,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5516,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Colder and louder blew the wind,"
5517,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"A gale from the northeast,"
5518,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"The snow fell hissing in the brine,"
5519,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And the billows frothed like yeast.
5520,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5521,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Down came the storm, and smote amain"
5522,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,The vessel in its strength;
5523,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,"
5524,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Then leaped her cable’s length.
5525,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5526,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,"
5527,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And do not tremble so;
5528,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,For I can weather the roughest gale
5529,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,That ever wind did blow.”
5530,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5531,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,He wrapped her warm in his seaman’s coat
5532,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Against the stinging blast;
5533,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"He cut a rope from a broken spar,"
5534,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And bound her to the mast.
5535,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5536,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“O father! I hear the church-bells ring,"
5537,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"O say, what may it be?”"
5538,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,“Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!”--
5539,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And he steered for the open sea.
5540,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5541,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“O father! I hear the sound of guns,"
5542,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"O say, what may it be?”"
5543,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“Some ship in distress, that cannot live"
5544,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,In such an angry sea!”
5545,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5546,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"“O father! I see a gleaming light,"
5547,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"O say, what may it be?”"
5548,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"But the father answered never a word,"
5549,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,A frozen corpse was he.
5550,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5551,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,"
5552,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"With his face turned to the skies,"
5553,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
5554,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,On his fixed and glassy eyes.
5555,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5556,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
5557,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,That savèd she might be;
5558,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave"
5559,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,On the Lake of Galilee.
5560,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5561,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"And fast through the midnight dark and drear,"
5562,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Through the whistling sleet and snow,"
5563,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept
5564,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Toward the reef of Norman’s Woe.
5565,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5566,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And ever the fitful gusts between
5567,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,A sound came from the land;
5568,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,It was the sound of the trampling surf
5569,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
5570,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5571,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"The breakers were right beneath her bows,"
5572,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"She drifted a dreary wreck,"
5573,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,And a whooping billow swept the crew
5574,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Like icicles from her deck.
5575,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5576,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,She struck where the white and fleecy waves
5577,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Looked soft as carded wool,"
5578,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,But the cruel rocks they gored her side
5579,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Like the horns of an angry bull.
5580,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5581,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice,"
5582,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,With the masts went by the board;
5583,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Like a vessel of glass she stove and sank,--"
5584,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Ho! ho! the breakers roared!
5585,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5586,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,At daybreak on the bleak sea-beach
5587,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"A fisherman stood aghast,"
5588,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,To see the form of a maiden fair
5589,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,Lashed close to a drifting mast.
5590,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5591,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"The salt sea was frozen on her breast,"
5592,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,The salt tears in her eyes;
5593,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,"
5594,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,On the billows fall and rise.
5595,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,
5596,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Such was the wreck of the _Hesperus_,"
5597,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,In the midnight and the snow!
5598,THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”,"Christ save us all from a death like this,"

5662,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,pulling people through hard places--that’s the use of life. It is the
5663,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,last resort of a mean mind to crack jokes that wreck innocent voyagers

5665,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5666,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,"
5667,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The ship was still as she could be;
5668,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Her sails from heaven received no motion;
5669,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Her keel was steady in the ocean.
5670,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5671,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Without either sign or sound of their shock,"
5672,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock;
5673,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"So little they rose, so little they fell,"
5674,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,They did not move the Inchcape Bell.
5675,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5676,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The Abbot of Aberbrothok
5677,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Had placed that Bell on the Inchcape Rock;
5678,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,"

5680,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5681,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell,"

5686,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The sun in heaven was shining gay;
5687,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,All things were joyful on that day;
5688,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled round,"

5690,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5691,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen,"
5692,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,A dark spot on the ocean green;
5693,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,"
5694,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.
5695,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5696,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,He felt the cheering power of spring;
5697,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"It made him whistle, it made him sing:"
5698,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"His heart was mirthful to excess,"

5700,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5701,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,His eye was on the Inchcape float.

5705,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5706,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,"
5707,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And to the Inchcape Rock they go;

5710,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5711,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound;

5720,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5721,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"So thick a haze o’erspread the sky,"
5722,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,They cannot see the sun on high:
5723,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The wind hath blown a gale all day,"
5724,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,At evening it hath died away.
5725,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5726,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,On the deck the Rover takes his stand;
5727,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,So dark it is they see no land.
5728,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be brighter soon,"
5729,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,For there is the dawn of the rising moon.”
5730,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5731,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"“Canst hear,” said one, “the broken roar?"

5735,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5736,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,They hear no sound; the swell is strong;
5737,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along"
5738,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock:
5739,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,“O Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock!”
5740,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5741,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,"
5742,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,He curst himself in his despair:
5743,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The waves rush in on every side,"
5744,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The ship is sinking beneath the tide.
5745,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
5746,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"But, even in his dying fear,"
5747,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,--"

5756,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,Once a year my pupils teach me “The Finding of the Lyre.” By the time I
5757,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,have learned it they know the meaning of every line and have caught the
5758,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"spirit of the verse. There is an ancient “lyre,” or violin, made in"
5759,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"northern Africa, in the possession of a Boston lady, and I have found"
5760,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,the mud-turtle rattle among the Indians on the Indian reservation at
5761,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"Syracuse, New York. They use it as a musical instrument in their"
5762,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,Thanksgiving dances. The poem helps to build an interest in history and
5763,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,mythology while it develops a child’s reverence and insight. (1819-91.)
5764,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,
5765,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,There lay upon the ocean’s shore
5766,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,What once a tortoise served to cover;
5767,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"A year and more, with rush and roar,"
5768,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"The surf had rolled it over,"
5769,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"Had played with it, and flung it by,"
5770,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"As wind and weather might decide it,"
5771,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,Then tossed it high where sand-drifts dry
5772,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,Cheap burial might provide it.
5773,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,
5774,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"It rested there to bleach or tan,"
5775,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"The rains had soaked, the sun had burned it;"
5776,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,With many a ban the fisherman
5777,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,Had stumbled o’er and spurned it;
5778,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"And there the fisher-girl would stay,"
5779,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,Conjecturing with her brother

5782,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,

5789,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"Give it but strings, and, lo, it sings,"

5791,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,
5792,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"So said, so done; the chords he strained,"

5794,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"The shell disdained a soul had gained,"
5795,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,The lyre had been discovered.
5796,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"O empty world that round us lies,"
5797,THE FINDING OF THE LYRE.,"Dead shell, of soul and thought forsaken,"

5810,A CHRYSALIS.,My little Mädchen found one day
5811,A CHRYSALIS.,"A curious something in her play,"

5815,A CHRYSALIS.,"Had neither legs nor wings, indeed;"
5816,A CHRYSALIS.,"And yet she was not sure, she said,"
5817,A CHRYSALIS.,Whether it was alive or dead.
5818,A CHRYSALIS.,
5819,A CHRYSALIS.,She brought it in her tiny hand

6272,KRINKEN.,
6273,KRINKEN.,"Krinken was a little child,--"
6274,KRINKEN.,It was summer when he smiled.
6275,KRINKEN.,Oft the hoary sea and grim

6282,KRINKEN.,
6283,KRINKEN.,Krinken on the beach one day

6300,KRINKEN.,To its bosom folded him--
6301,KRINKEN.,"Clasped and kissed the little form,"
6302,KRINKEN.,And the ocean’s heart was warm.
6303,KRINKEN.,
6304,KRINKEN.,Now the sea calls out no more;

7185,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,I wonder if the English people appreciate “The Homes of England.” It is
7186,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,a stately poem worthy of a Goethe or a Shakespeare. England is
7187,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"distinctively a country of homes, pretty, little, humble homes as well"
7188,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"as stately palaces and castles, homes well made of stone or brick for"
7189,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"the most part, and clad with ivy and roses. Who would not be proud to"
7190,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,have had such a home as Ann Hathaway’s humble cottage or one of the
7191,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,little huts in the Lake District? The homes of America are often more
7192,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"palatial, especially in small cities, but the use of wood in America"
7193,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,makes them less substantial than the slate-and-brick houses of England.

7227,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"Through glowing orchards forth they peep,"
7228,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,Each from its nook of leaves;
7229,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"And fearless there the lowly sleep,"
7230,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,As the bird beneath their eaves.
7231,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,
7232,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"The free, fair homes of England!"
7233,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"Long, long, in hut and hall"
7234,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,May hearts of native proof be reared
7235,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,To guard each hallowed wall!
7236,THE HOMES OF ENGLAND.,"And green forever be the groves,"

7523,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Then Ocnus of Falerii

7563,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7564,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"He smiled on those bold Romans,"

7571,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,If Astur clears the way?”
7572,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7573,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Then, whirling up his broadsword"
7574,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"With both hands to the height,"
7575,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"He rushed against Horatius,"
7576,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And smote with all his might.
7577,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,With shield and blade Horatius
7578,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Right deftly turned the blow.
7579,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;"

7583,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7584,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"He reeled, and on Herminius"
7585,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,He leaned one breathing space;
7586,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Then, like a wildcat mad with wounds,"
7587,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Sprang right at Astur’s face.
7588,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Through teeth, and skull, and helmet,"
7589,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"So fierce a thrust he sped,"
7590,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,The good sword stood a handbreadth out
7591,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Behind the Tuscan’s head.
7592,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7593,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And the great Lord of Luna
7594,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Fell at the deadly stroke,"
7595,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,As falls on Mount Alvernus
7596,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,A thunder-smitten oak.
7597,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Far o’er the crashing forest
7598,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,The giant arms lie spread;
7599,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And the pale augurs, muttering low,"

7601,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7602,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,On Astur’s throat Horatius

7611,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But at his haughty challenge
7612,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"A sullen murmur ran,"
7613,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread,"
7614,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Along that glittering van.
7615,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"There lacked not men of prowess,"

7619,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7620,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But all Etruria’s noblest

7631,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7632,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Was none who would be foremost
7633,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,To lead such dire attack?
7634,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But those behind cried “Forward!”
7635,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And those before cried “Back!”
7636,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And backward now and forward

7642,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7643,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Yet one man for one moment
7644,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Strode out before the crowd;

7651,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7652,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Thrice looked he at the city;
7653,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Thrice looked he at the dead;
7654,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And thrice came on in fury,"
7655,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And thrice turned back in dread:
7656,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And, white with fear and hatred,"
7657,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Scowled at the narrow way
7658,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,"
7659,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,The bravest Tuscans lay.
7660,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,

7669,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7670,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Back darted Spurius Lartius;
7671,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Herminius darted back:
7672,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And, as they passed, beneath their feet"

7674,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"But when they turned their faces,"
7675,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And on the farther shore
7676,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Saw brave Horatius stand alone,"
7677,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,They would have crossed once more.
7678,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7679,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But with a crash like thunder
7680,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Fell every loosened beam,"
7681,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And, like a dam, the mighty wreck"
7682,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Lay right athwart the stream;
7683,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And a long shout of triumph
7684,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Rose from the walls of Rome,"
7685,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,As to the highest turret tops
7686,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Was splashed the yellow foam.
7687,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7688,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And, like a horse unbroken"

7709,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,"
7710,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,To Sextus naught spake he;
7711,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But he saw on Palatinus
7712,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,The white porch of his home;
7713,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And he spake to the noble river
7714,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,That rolls by the towers of Rome:
7715,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7716,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,“O Tiber! Father Tiber!

7722,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And, with his harness on his back,"
7723,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Plunged headlong in the tide.
7724,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7725,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,No sound of joy or sorrow
7726,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Was heard from either bank;
7727,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"But friends and foes in dumb surprise,"
7728,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"With parted lips and straining eyes,"
7729,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Stood gazing where he sank;
7730,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And when above the surges
7731,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"They saw his crest appear,"
7732,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,"
7733,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And even the ranks of Tuscany

7741,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And spent with changing blows:
7742,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"And oft they thought him sinking,"
7743,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But still again he rose.
7744,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7745,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"Never, I ween, did swimmer,"
7746,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"In such an evil case,"
7747,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Struggle through such a raging flood
7748,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Safe to the landing place;
7749,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,But his limbs were borne up bravely
7750,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"By the brave heart within,"
7751,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,And our good Father Tiber
7752,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,Bore bravely up his chin.
7753,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,
7754,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,“Curse on him!” quoth false Sextus;
7755,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,“Will not the villain drown?

7772,HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE.,"They gave him of the corn land,"

7940,JUNE.,"“June” (by James Russell Lowell, 1819-91), is a fragment from “The"
7941,JUNE.,Vision of Sir Launfal.” It finds a place in this volume because it is
7942,JUNE.,the most perfect description of a charming day ever written.
7943,JUNE.,
7944,JUNE.,What is so rare as a day in June?
7945,JUNE.,"Then, if ever, come perfect days;"
7946,JUNE.,"Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,"
7947,JUNE.,And over it softly her warm ear lays:
7948,JUNE.,"Whether we look, or whether we listen,"
7949,JUNE.,"We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;"
7950,JUNE.,"Every clod feels a stir of might,"
7951,JUNE.,"An instinct within it that reaches and towers,"
7952,JUNE.,"And, groping blindly above it for light,"
7953,JUNE.,Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;
7954,JUNE.,The flush of life may well be seen
7955,JUNE.,Thrilling back over hills and valleys;
7956,JUNE.,The cowslip startles in meadows green.
7957,JUNE.,"The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,"
7958,JUNE.,And there’s never a leaf nor a blade too mean
7959,JUNE.,To be some happy creature’s palace;
7960,JUNE.,"The little bird sits at his door in the sun,"
7961,JUNE.,"Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,"
7962,JUNE.,And lets his illumined being o’errun
7963,JUNE.,With the deluge of summer it receives;
7964,JUNE.,"His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,"
7965,JUNE.,And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings;
7966,JUNE.,"He sings to the wide world, and she to her nest,--"
7967,JUNE.,In the nice ear of Nature which song is the best?

8894,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Tennyson’s (1807-92) “The _Revenge_” finds a welcome here because it is
8895,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,a favourite with teachers of elocution and their audiences. It teaches

8898,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,"
8899,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from away:"
8900,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,“Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!”
8901,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: “’Fore God, I am no coward;"
8902,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,"
8903,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick."
8904,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?”
8905,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8906,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: “I know you are no coward;
8907,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"You fly them for a moment, to fight with them again."
8908,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But I’ve ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.
8909,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,"
8910,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.”
8911,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8912,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"So Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war that day,"
8913,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;
8914,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land
8915,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Very carefully and slow,"
8916,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Men of Bideford in Devon,"
8917,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And we laid them on the ballast down below;
8918,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For we brought them all aboard,"
8919,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And they blest him in their pain that they were not left to Spain,"
8920,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord."
8921,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8922,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,"
8923,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And he sail’d away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,"
8924,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.
8925,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,“Shall we fight or shall we fly?
8926,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Good Sir Richard, tell us now,"
8927,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,For to fight is but to die!

8929,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,“There’ll be little of us left by the time this sun be set”
8930,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And Sir Richard said again: “We be all good Englishmen.
8931,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,"
8932,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,For I never turn’d my back upon Don or devil yet.”
8933,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8934,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Sir Richard spoke and he laugh’d, and we roar’d a hurrah, and so"

8936,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;"
8937,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,"
8938,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the little _Revenge_ ran on thro’ the long sea-lane between.
8939,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8940,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laugh’d,"
8941,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft

8946,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8947,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And while now the great _San Philip_ hung above us like a cloud
8948,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Whence the thunderbolt will fall
8949,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Long and loud.
8950,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Four galleons drew away
8951,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"From the Spanish fleet that day,"
8952,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,"
8953,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the battle-thunder broke from them all.
8954,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8955,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But anon the great _San Philip_, she bethought herself and went,"
8956,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;
8957,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,"
8958,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,"
8959,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And a dozen times we shook ’em off as a dog that shakes his ears
8960,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,When he leaps from the water to the land.
8961,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8962,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,"
8963,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three;
8964,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,"
8965,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder"

8967,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead"
8968,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,and her shame.
8969,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For some were sunk and many were shatter’d, and so could"
8970,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,fight us no more--
8971,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?"
8972,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8973,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For he said, “Fight on! fight on!”"
8974,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Tho’ his vessel was all but a wreck;
8975,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,"
8976,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,"
8977,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,"
8978,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,"
8979,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And he said, “Fight on! Fight on!”"
8980,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8981,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far"
8982,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"over the summer sea,"
8983,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;
8984,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But they dared not touch us again, for they fear’d that"
8985,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"we still could sting,"
8986,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,So they watched what the end would be.
8987,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And we had not fought them in vain,"
8988,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But in perilous plight were we,"
8989,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,"
8990,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And half of the rest of us maim’d for life
8991,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;
8992,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,"
8993,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was"
8994,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,all of it spent;
8995,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;
8996,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:
8997,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,“We have fought such a fight for a day and a night
8998,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,As may never be fought again!
8999,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"We have won great glory, my men!"
9000,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And a day less or more
9001,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"At sea or ashore,"
9002,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,We die--does it matter when?
9003,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Sink me the ship, Master Gunner--sink her, split her in twain!"
9004,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!”"
9005,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
9006,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the gunner said. “Ay, ay,” but the seamen made reply:"
9007,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"“We have children, we have wives,"
9008,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the Lord hath spared our lives.
9009,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;"
9010,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"We shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow.”"
9011,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe."
9012,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,"
9013,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,"
9014,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;
9015,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:"
9016,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,“I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;

9196,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,
9197,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,"“The larch has hung all his tassels forth,”"
9198,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,
9199,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,The delight with which trees hang out their new little tassels every
9200,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,year is one of the charms of “the pine family.” John Burroughs sent us
9201,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,"down a tiny hemlock, that grew in our window-box at school for five"

9213,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,"I have breathed on the South, and the chestnut-flowers"

9219,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,
9220,THE VOICE OF SPRING.,"I have looked o’er the hills of the stormy North,"

9246,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"“The Forsaken Merman,” by Matthew Arnold (1822-88), is a poem that I do"
9247,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"not expect children to appreciate fully, even when they care enough for"
9248,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"it to learn it. It is too long for most children to commit to memory,"
9249,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,and I generally assign one stanza to one pupil and another to another
9250,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,pupil until it is divided up among them. The poem is a masterpiece.
9251,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Doubtless the poet meant to show that the forsaken merman had a greater
9252,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,soul to save than the woman who sought to save her soul by deserting
9253,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,natural duty. Salvation does not come through the faith that builds
9254,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,itself at the expense of love.

9269,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,“Margaret! Margaret!”
9270,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Children’s voices should be dear

9273,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Surely she will come again!

9275,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"This way, this way!"
9276,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"“Mother dear, we cannot stay!"
9277,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,The wild white horses foam and fret.”

9283,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And the little gray church on the windy shore;
9284,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Then come down!
9285,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,She will not come though you call all day;
9286,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Come away, come away!"

9288,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Children dear, was it yesterday"
9289,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,We heard the sweet bells over the bay?
9290,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"In the caverns where we lay,"
9291,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Through the surf and through the swell,"
9292,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,The far-off sound of a silver bell?
9293,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,"
9294,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Where the winds are all asleep;
9295,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Where the spent lights quiver and gleam,"
9296,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Where the salt weed sways in the stream,"
9297,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,"
9298,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;
9299,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,"
9300,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Dry their mail and bask in the brine;
9301,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Where great whales come sailing by,"
9302,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Sail and sail, with unshut eye,"
9303,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Round the world forever and aye?
9304,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,When did music come this way?

9307,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Children dear, was it yesterday"
9308,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,(Call yet once) that she went away?
9309,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Once she sate with you and me,"
9310,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,"
9311,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And the youngest sate on her knee.
9312,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She comb’d its bright hair, and she tended it well,"
9313,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.
9314,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She sigh’d, she look’d up through the clear green sea;"
9315,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She said: “I must go, for my kinsfolk pray"
9316,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,In the little gray church on the shore to-day.
9317,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,’Twill be Easter-time in the world--ah me!
9318,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee.”"
9319,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"I said: “Go up, dear heart, through the waves;"
9320,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!”"
9321,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She smil’d, she went up through the surf in the bay."
9322,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Children dear, was it yesterday?"
9323,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,
9324,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Children dear, were we long alone?"
9325,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"“The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;"
9326,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Long prayers,” I said, “in the world they say;"
9327,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Come!” I said; and we rose through the surf in the bay.
9328,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"We went up the beach, by the sandy down"
9329,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall’d town;"
9330,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Through the narrow pav’d streets, where all was still,"
9331,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,To the little gray church on the windy hill.
9332,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,"
9333,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.
9334,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"We climb’d on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,"
9335,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And we gaz’d up the aisle through the small leaded panes.
9336,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:
9337,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"“Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!"
9338,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Dear heart,” I said, “we are long alone;"
9339,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.”"
9340,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"But, ah, she gave me never a look,"
9341,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,For her eyes were seal’d to the holy book!
9342,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Loud prays the priest: shut stands the door.
9343,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Come away, children, call no more!"
9344,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Come away, come down, call no more!"
9345,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,
9346,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Down, down, down!"
9347,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Down to the depths of the sea!
9348,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
9349,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Singing most joyfully.
9350,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Hark what she sings: “O joy, O joy,"
9351,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy!"
9352,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;"
9353,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"For the wheel where I spun,"
9354,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And the blessèd light of the sun!”
9355,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"And so she sings her fill,"
9356,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Singing most joyfully,"
9357,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Till the spindle drops from her hand,"
9358,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
9359,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,"
9360,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And over the sand at the sea;
9361,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And her eyes are set in a stare;
9362,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"
9363,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"And anon there drops a tear,"
9364,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"From a sorrow-clouded eye,"
9365,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"And a heart sorrow-laden,"
9366,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"A long, long sigh;"
9367,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden,"
9368,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,And the gleam of her golden hair.
9369,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,
9370,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Come away, away, children;"
9371,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"Come, children, come down!"
9372,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,The hoarse wind blows colder;
9373,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Lights shine in the town.
9374,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,She will start from her slumber
9375,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,When gusts shake the door;
9376,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"She will hear the winds howling,"
9377,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,Will hear the waves roar.
9378,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN.,"We shall see, while above us"

10161,CONTENTMENT,"“Contentment,” by Edward Dyer (1545-1607). This poem holds much to"
10162,CONTENTMENT,comfort and control people who are shut up to the joys of
10163,CONTENTMENT,meditation--people to whom the world of activity is closed. To be
10164,CONTENTMENT,independent of things material--this is the soul’s pleasure.
10165,CONTENTMENT,
10166,CONTENTMENT,My mind to me a kingdom is;
10167,CONTENTMENT,Such perfect joy therein I find
10168,CONTENTMENT,As far excels all earthly bliss
10169,CONTENTMENT,That God or Nature hath assigned;
10170,CONTENTMENT,"Though much I want that most would have,"
10171,CONTENTMENT,Yet still my mind forbids to crave.
10172,CONTENTMENT,
10173,CONTENTMENT,"Content I live; this is my stay,--"
10174,CONTENTMENT,I seek no more than may suffice.
10175,CONTENTMENT,I press to bear no haughty sway;
10176,CONTENTMENT,"Look, what I lack my mind supplies."
10177,CONTENTMENT,"Lo, thus I triumph like a king,"
10178,CONTENTMENT,Content with that my mind doth bring.
10179,CONTENTMENT,
10180,CONTENTMENT,"I laugh not at another’s loss,"
10181,CONTENTMENT,I grudge not at another’s gain;
10182,CONTENTMENT,No worldly wave my mind can toss;
10183,CONTENTMENT,I brook that is another’s bane.
10184,CONTENTMENT,"I fear no foe, nor fawn on friend;"
10185,CONTENTMENT,"I loathe not life, nor dread mine end."
10186,CONTENTMENT,
10187,CONTENTMENT,My wealth is health and perfect ease;
10188,CONTENTMENT,My conscience clear my chief defense;
10189,CONTENTMENT,I never seek by bribes to please
10190,CONTENTMENT,Nor by desert to give offense.
10191,CONTENTMENT,"Thus do I live, thus will I die;"
10192,CONTENTMENT,Would all did so as well as I!

10222,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"“The Old Oaken Bucket,” by Samuel Woodworth (1785-1848), is a poem we"
10223,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,love because it is an elegant expression of something very dear and
10224,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,homely.
10225,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,
10226,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,"
10227,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,When fond recollection presents them to view!
10228,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood,"
10229,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,And every loved spot which my infancy knew!
10230,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it,"
10231,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell,"
10232,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it,"
10233,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,And e’en the rude bucket that hung in the well--
10234,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,"
10235,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.
10236,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,
10237,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"That moss-covered vessel I hailed as a treasure,"
10238,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"For often at noon, when returned from the field,"
10239,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,"
10240,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.
10241,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,"
10242,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;
10243,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing,"
10244,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well--"
10245,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,"
10246,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.
10247,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,
10248,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it
10249,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips!
10250,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,"Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,"
10251,THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET,The brightest that beauty or revelry sips.

10264,THE RAVEN.,"“The Raven,” by Edgar Allan Poe (1809-49), is placed here because so"
10265,THE RAVEN.,many college men speak of it at once as the great poem of their
10266,THE RAVEN.,boyhood. The poem caught me when a child by its refrain and weird
10267,THE RAVEN.,picturesqueness. It has never outgrown its mechanical charm.
10268,THE RAVEN.,
10269,THE RAVEN.,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,"
10270,THE RAVEN.,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--
10271,THE RAVEN.,"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
10272,THE RAVEN.,"As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door"
10273,THE RAVEN.,"“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door--"
10274,THE RAVEN.,"Only this, and nothing more.”"
10275,THE RAVEN.,
10276,THE RAVEN.,"Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,"
10277,THE RAVEN.,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor;
10278,THE RAVEN.,Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
10279,THE RAVEN.,From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--
10280,THE RAVEN.,For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
10281,THE RAVEN.,Nameless here for evermore.
10282,THE RAVEN.,
10283,THE RAVEN.,"And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain"
10284,THE RAVEN.,Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
10285,THE RAVEN.,"So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,"
10286,THE RAVEN.,“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
10287,THE RAVEN.,Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:
10288,THE RAVEN.,"This it is, and nothing more.”"
10289,THE RAVEN.,
10290,THE RAVEN.,"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"
10291,THE RAVEN.,"“Sir,” said I, “or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;"
10292,THE RAVEN.,"But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,"
10293,THE RAVEN.,"And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,"
10294,THE RAVEN.,That I scarce was sure I heard you.” Here I opened wide the door:
10295,THE RAVEN.,"Darkness there, and nothing more."
10296,THE RAVEN.,
10297,THE RAVEN.,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,"
10298,THE RAVEN.,"fearing,"
10299,THE RAVEN.,"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;"
10300,THE RAVEN.,"But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,"
10301,THE RAVEN.,"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”"
10302,THE RAVEN.,"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”"
10303,THE RAVEN.,"Merely this, and nothing more."
10304,THE RAVEN.,
10305,THE RAVEN.,"Back into my chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
10306,THE RAVEN.,"Soon again I heard a rapping, something louder than before:"
10307,THE RAVEN.,"“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;"
10308,THE RAVEN.,"Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--"
10309,THE RAVEN.,"Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore."
10310,THE RAVEN.,"’Tis the wind, and nothing more.”"
10311,THE RAVEN.,
10312,THE RAVEN.,"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,"
10313,THE RAVEN.,"In there stepped a stately Raven, of the saintly days of yore;"
10314,THE RAVEN.,"Not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he;"
10315,THE RAVEN.,"But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--"
10316,THE RAVEN.,"Perched above a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door--"
10317,THE RAVEN.,"Perched, and sat, and nothing more."
10318,THE RAVEN.,
10319,THE RAVEN.,"Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,"
10320,THE RAVEN.,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore;
10321,THE RAVEN.,"“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art"
10322,THE RAVEN.,"sure, no craven;"
10323,THE RAVEN.,"Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the nightly shore,"
10324,THE RAVEN.,Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night’s Plutonian shore?”
10325,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”"
10326,THE RAVEN.,
10327,THE RAVEN.,"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
10328,THE RAVEN.,"Though its answer, little meaning, little relevancy bore;"
10329,THE RAVEN.,For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
10330,THE RAVEN.,Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
10331,THE RAVEN.,Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
10332,THE RAVEN.,With such a name as “Nevermore.”
10333,THE RAVEN.,
10334,THE RAVEN.,"But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only"
10335,THE RAVEN.,"That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour;"
10336,THE RAVEN.,"Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,"
10337,THE RAVEN.,"Till I scarcely more than muttered--“Other friends have flown before,"
10338,THE RAVEN.,"On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”"
10339,THE RAVEN.,"Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”"
10340,THE RAVEN.,
10341,THE RAVEN.,"Startled by the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
10342,THE RAVEN.,"“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,"
10343,THE RAVEN.,"Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster"
10344,THE RAVEN.,"Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore--"
10345,THE RAVEN.,Till the dirges of his hope this melancholy burden bore--
10346,THE RAVEN.,"Of ‘Never, nevermore,’”"
10347,THE RAVEN.,
10348,THE RAVEN.,"But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,"
10349,THE RAVEN.,"Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and"
10350,THE RAVEN.,"bust, and door;"
10351,THE RAVEN.,"Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking"
10352,THE RAVEN.,"Fancy into fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--"
10353,THE RAVEN.,"What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore"
10354,THE RAVEN.,Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
10355,THE RAVEN.,
10356,THE RAVEN.,"Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
10357,THE RAVEN.,To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
10358,THE RAVEN.,"This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
10359,THE RAVEN.,"On the cushion’s velvet lining, that the lamp-light gloated o’er,"
10360,THE RAVEN.,"But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o’er,"
10361,THE RAVEN.,"She shall press, ah, nevermore!"
10362,THE RAVEN.,
10363,THE RAVEN.,"Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
10364,THE RAVEN.,"Swung by seraphim, whose footfalls twinkled on the tufted floor."
10365,THE RAVEN.,"“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee--by these angels He"
10366,THE RAVEN.,hath sent thee
10367,THE RAVEN.,Respite--respite and nepenthe from my memories of Lenore!
10368,THE RAVEN.,"Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!”"
10369,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”"
10370,THE RAVEN.,
10371,THE RAVEN.,"“Prophet,” said I, “thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!"
10372,THE RAVEN.,"Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore"
10373,THE RAVEN.,"Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,"
10374,THE RAVEN.,"On this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore,"
10375,THE RAVEN.,"Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me, tell me, I implore!”"
10376,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”"
10377,THE RAVEN.,
10378,THE RAVEN.,"“Prophet,” said I, “thing of evil!--prophet still if bird or devil!"
10379,THE RAVEN.,By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
10380,THE RAVEN.,"Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aiden"
10381,THE RAVEN.,"It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore!"
10382,THE RAVEN.,"Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?”"
10383,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”"
10384,THE RAVEN.,
10385,THE RAVEN.,"“Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend,” I shrieked, upstarting--"
10386,THE RAVEN.,“Get thee back into the tempest and the night’s Plutonian shore;
10387,THE RAVEN.,"Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken,"
10388,THE RAVEN.,"Leave my loneliness unbroken--quit the bust above my door,"
10389,THE RAVEN.,Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door!”
10390,THE RAVEN.,"Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”"
10391,THE RAVEN.,
10392,THE RAVEN.,"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,"
10393,THE RAVEN.,"On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door;"
10394,THE RAVEN.,"And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,"
10395,THE RAVEN.,"And the lamp-light o’er him streaming, throws his shadow on the floor;"
10396,THE RAVEN.,"And my soul from out that shadow, that lies floating on the floor,"
10397,THE RAVEN.,Shall be lifted--nevermore!

10939,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10940,RABBI BEN EZRA,"“Rabbi Ben Ezra” (by Robert Browning, 1812-89). Youth is for dispute"
10941,RABBI BEN EZRA,"and age for counsel; each year, each period of a man’s life is but the"
10942,RABBI BEN EZRA,necessary step to the next. Youth is an uncertain thing to bank on.
10943,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10944,RABBI BEN EZRA,“Grow old along with me!
10945,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The best is yet to be,"
10946,RABBI BEN EZRA,The last of life for which the first was made.”
10947,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10948,RABBI BEN EZRA,“Rabbi Ben Ezra” is a plea for each period in life. Aspiration is the
10949,RABBI BEN EZRA,keynote.
10950,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10951,RABBI BEN EZRA,"“ ... Trust God; see all, nor be afraid!”"
10952,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10953,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10954,RABBI BEN EZRA,Grow old along with me!
10955,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The best is yet to be,"
10956,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The last of life, for which the first was made:"
10957,RABBI BEN EZRA,Our times are in His hand
10958,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Who saith, “A whole I plann’d,"
10959,RABBI BEN EZRA,Youth shows but half; trust God: see all nor be afraid!”
10960,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10961,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Not that, amassing flowers,"
10962,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Youth sigh’d, “Which rose make ours,"
10963,RABBI BEN EZRA,Which lily leave and then as best recall?”
10964,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Not that, admiring stars,"
10965,RABBI BEN EZRA,"It yearn’d, “Nor Jove, nor Mars;"
10966,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all!”"
10967,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10968,RABBI BEN EZRA,Not for such hopes and fears
10969,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Annulling youth’s brief years,"
10970,RABBI BEN EZRA,Do I remonstrate: folly wide the mark!
10971,RABBI BEN EZRA,Rather I prize the doubt
10972,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Low kinds exist without,"
10973,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Finish’d and finite clods, untroubled by a spark."
10974,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10975,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Poor vaunt of life indeed,"
10976,RABBI BEN EZRA,Were man but formed to feed
10977,RABBI BEN EZRA,"On joy, to solely seek and find and feast:"
10978,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Such feasting ended, then"
10979,RABBI BEN EZRA,As sure an end to men;
10980,RABBI BEN EZRA,Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-cramm’d beast?
10981,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10982,RABBI BEN EZRA,Rejoice we are allied
10983,RABBI BEN EZRA,To That which doth provide
10984,RABBI BEN EZRA,"And not partake, effect and not receive!"
10985,RABBI BEN EZRA,A spark disturbs our clod;
10986,RABBI BEN EZRA,Nearer we hold of God
10987,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Who gives, than of His tribes that take, I must believe."
10988,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10989,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Then, welcome each rebuff"
10990,RABBI BEN EZRA,"That turns earth’s smoothness rough,"
10991,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Each sting, that bids nor sit nor stand, but go!"
10992,RABBI BEN EZRA,Be our joys three parts pain!
10993,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Strive, and hold cheap the strain;"
10994,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!"
10995,RABBI BEN EZRA,
10996,RABBI BEN EZRA,"For thence,--a paradox"
10997,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Which comforts while it mocks,--"
10998,RABBI BEN EZRA,Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:
10999,RABBI BEN EZRA,"What I aspired to be,"
11000,RABBI BEN EZRA,"And was not, comforts me:"
11001,RABBI BEN EZRA,"A brute I might have been, but would not sink i’ the scale."
11002,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11003,RABBI BEN EZRA,What is he but a brute
11004,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Whose flesh has soul to suit,"
11005,RABBI BEN EZRA,Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play?
11006,RABBI BEN EZRA,"To man, propose this test--"
11007,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Thy body at its best,"
11008,RABBI BEN EZRA,How far can that project thy soul on its lone way?
11009,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11010,RABBI BEN EZRA,Yet gifts should prove their use:
11011,RABBI BEN EZRA,I own the Past profuse
11012,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Of power each side, perfection every turn:"
11013,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Eyes, ears took in their dole,"
11014,RABBI BEN EZRA,Brain treasured up the whole:
11015,RABBI BEN EZRA,Should not the heart beat once “How good to live and learn?”
11016,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11017,RABBI BEN EZRA,Not once beat “Praise be Thine!
11018,RABBI BEN EZRA,"I see the whole design,"
11019,RABBI BEN EZRA,"I, who saw power, see now love perfect too:"
11020,RABBI BEN EZRA,Perfect I call Thy plan:
11021,RABBI BEN EZRA,Thanks that I was a man!
11022,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Maker, remake, complete,--I trust what Thou shalt do!”"
11023,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11024,RABBI BEN EZRA,"For pleasant is this flesh,"
11025,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Our soul, in its rose-mesh"
11026,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Pull’d ever to the earth, still yearns for rest;"
11027,RABBI BEN EZRA,Would we some prize might hold
11028,RABBI BEN EZRA,To match those manifold
11029,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Possessions of the brute,--gain most, as we did best!"
11030,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11031,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Let us not always say,"
11032,RABBI BEN EZRA,“Spite of this flesh to-day
11033,RABBI BEN EZRA,"I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!”"
11034,RABBI BEN EZRA,"As the bird wings and sings,"
11035,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Let us cry, “All good things"
11036,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!”"
11037,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11038,RABBI BEN EZRA,Therefore I summon age
11039,RABBI BEN EZRA,"To grant youth’s heritage,"
11040,RABBI BEN EZRA,Life’s struggle having so far reached its term:
11041,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Thence shall I pass, approved"
11042,RABBI BEN EZRA,"A man, for aye removed"
11043,RABBI BEN EZRA,From the developed brute; a god though in the germ.
11044,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11045,RABBI BEN EZRA,And I shall thereupon
11046,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Take rest, ere I be gone"
11047,RABBI BEN EZRA,Once more on my adventure brave and new:
11048,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Fearless and unperplex’d,"
11049,RABBI BEN EZRA,"When I wage battle next,"
11050,RABBI BEN EZRA,"What weapons to select, what armour to indue."
11051,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11052,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Youth ended, I shall try"
11053,RABBI BEN EZRA,My gain or loss thereby;
11054,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold:"
11055,RABBI BEN EZRA,"And I shall weigh the same,"
11056,RABBI BEN EZRA,Give life its praise or blame:
11057,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old."
11058,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11059,RABBI BEN EZRA,"For note, when evening shuts,"
11060,RABBI BEN EZRA,A certain moment cuts
11061,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The deed off, calls the glory from the gray:"
11062,RABBI BEN EZRA,A whisper from the west
11063,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Shoots--“Add this to the rest,"
11064,RABBI BEN EZRA,Take it and try its worth: here dies another day.”
11065,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11066,RABBI BEN EZRA,"So, still within this life,"
11067,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Though lifted o’er its strife,"
11068,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last,"
11069,RABBI BEN EZRA,"“This rage was right i’ the main,"
11070,RABBI BEN EZRA,That acquiescence vain:
11071,RABBI BEN EZRA,The Future I may face now I have proved the Past”
11072,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11073,RABBI BEN EZRA,For more is not reserved
11074,RABBI BEN EZRA,"To man, with soul just nerved"
11075,RABBI BEN EZRA,To act to-morrow what he learns to-day:
11076,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Here, work enough to watch"
11077,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The Master work, and catch"
11078,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool’s true play."
11079,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11080,RABBI BEN EZRA,"As it was better, youth"
11081,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Should strive, through acts uncouth,"
11082,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Toward making, than repose on aught found made:"
11083,RABBI BEN EZRA,"So, better, age, exempt"
11084,RABBI BEN EZRA,"From strife, should know, than tempt"
11085,RABBI BEN EZRA,Further. Thou waitedest age: wait death nor be afraid!
11086,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11087,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Enough now, if the Right"
11088,RABBI BEN EZRA,And Good and Infinite
11089,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own,"
11090,RABBI BEN EZRA,"With knowledge absolute,"
11091,RABBI BEN EZRA,Subject to no dispute
11092,RABBI BEN EZRA,"From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone."
11093,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11094,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Be there, for once and all,"
11095,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Sever’d great minds from small,"
11096,RABBI BEN EZRA,Announced to each his station in the Past!
11097,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Was I, the world arraigned,"
11098,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Were they, my soul disdain’d,"
11099,RABBI BEN EZRA,Right? Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last!
11100,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11101,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Now, who shall arbitrate?"
11102,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Ten men love what I hate,"
11103,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Shun what I follow, slight what I receive;"
11104,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Ten, who in ears and eyes"
11105,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Match me: we all surmise,"
11106,RABBI BEN EZRA,"They this thing, and I that: whom shall my soul believe?"
11107,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11108,RABBI BEN EZRA,Not on the vulgar mass
11109,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Call’d “work,” must sentence pass,"
11110,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Things done, that took the eye and had the price;"
11111,RABBI BEN EZRA,"O’er which, from level stand,"
11112,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The low world laid its hand,"
11113,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice:"
11114,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11115,RABBI BEN EZRA,"But all, the world’s coarse thumb"
11116,RABBI BEN EZRA,"And finger fail’d to plumb,"
11117,RABBI BEN EZRA,So pass’d in making up the main account;
11118,RABBI BEN EZRA,"All instincts immature,"
11119,RABBI BEN EZRA,"All purposes unsure,"
11120,RABBI BEN EZRA,"That weigh’d not as his work, yet swell’d the man’s amount:"
11121,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11122,RABBI BEN EZRA,Thoughts hardly to be pack’d
11123,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Into a narrow act,"
11124,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Fancies that broke through language and escaped,"
11125,RABBI BEN EZRA,"All I could never be,"
11126,RABBI BEN EZRA,"All, men ignored in me,"
11127,RABBI BEN EZRA,"This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped."
11128,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11129,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Ay, note that Potter’s wheel,"
11130,RABBI BEN EZRA,That metaphor! and feel
11131,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,--"
11132,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Thou, to whom fools propound,"
11133,RABBI BEN EZRA,"When the wine makes its round,"
11134,RABBI BEN EZRA,"“Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day!”"
11135,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11136,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Fool! All that is, at all,"
11137,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Lasts ever, past recall;"
11138,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure;"
11139,RABBI BEN EZRA,"What enter’d into thee,"
11140,RABBI BEN EZRA,"_That_ was, is, and shall be:"
11141,RABBI BEN EZRA,Time’s wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure.
11142,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11143,RABBI BEN EZRA,He fix’d thee ’mid this dance
11144,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Of plastic circumstance,"
11145,RABBI BEN EZRA,"This Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest"
11146,RABBI BEN EZRA,Machinery just meant
11147,RABBI BEN EZRA,"To give thy soul its bent,"
11148,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impress’d."
11149,RABBI BEN EZRA,

11153,RABBI BEN EZRA,"What though, about thy rim,"
11154,RABBI BEN EZRA,Scull-things in order grim
11155,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress?"
11156,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11157,RABBI BEN EZRA,Look not thou down but up!
11158,RABBI BEN EZRA,"To uses of a cup,"
11159,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The festal board, lamp’s flash and trumpet’s peal,"
11160,RABBI BEN EZRA,"The new wine’s foaming flow,"
11161,RABBI BEN EZRA,The master’s lips aglow!
11162,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Thou, heaven’s consummate cup, what need’st thou with earth’s wheel?"
11163,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11164,RABBI BEN EZRA,"But I need, now as then,"
11165,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Thee, God, who mouldest men;"
11166,RABBI BEN EZRA,"And since, not even while the whirl was worst"
11167,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Did I,--to the wheel of life"
11168,RABBI BEN EZRA,"With shapes and colours rife,"
11169,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Bound dizzily,--mistake my end, to slake Thy thirst:"
11170,RABBI BEN EZRA,
11171,RABBI BEN EZRA,"So, take and use Thy work:"
11172,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Amend what flaws may lurk,"

11889,SONG OF MYSELF.,
11890,SONG OF MYSELF.,“The Song of Myself” is one of Walt Whitman’s (1819-92) most
11891,SONG OF MYSELF.,characteristic poems. I love the swing and the stride of his great long
11892,SONG OF MYSELF.,lines. I love his rough-shod way of trampling down and kicking out of
11893,SONG OF MYSELF.,the way the conventionalities that spring up like poisonous mushrooms
11894,SONG OF MYSELF.,to make the world a vast labyrinth of petty “proprieties” until
11895,SONG OF MYSELF.,everything is nasty. I love the oxygen he pours on the world. I love
11896,SONG OF MYSELF.,"his genius for brotherliness, his picture of the Negro with rolling"
11897,SONG OF MYSELF.,eyes and the firelock in the corner. These excerpts are some of his
11898,SONG OF MYSELF.,best lines.
11899,SONG OF MYSELF.,
11900,SONG OF MYSELF.,"I celebrate myself, and sing myself,"

11928,SONG OF MYSELF.,"A child said, “_What is the grass?_” fetching it to me with full hands;"

11974,SONG OF MYSELF.,"days and faithful of nights,"
11975,SONG OF MYSELF.,"And chalked in large letters on a board, “_Be of good cheer, we will"
11976,SONG OF MYSELF.,not desert you_”;
