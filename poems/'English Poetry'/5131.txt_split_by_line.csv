32,TO IANTHE. {1},
33,TO IANTHE. {1},
34,TO IANTHE. {1},
35,TO IANTHE. {1},"Not in those climes where I have late been straying,"
36,TO IANTHE. {1},"Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed,"
37,TO IANTHE. {1},Not in those visions to the heart displaying
38,TO IANTHE. {1},"Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed,"
39,TO IANTHE. {1},Hath aught like thee in truth or fancy seemed:
40,TO IANTHE. {1},"Nor, having seen thee, shall I vainly seek"
41,TO IANTHE. {1},To paint those charms which varied as they beamed--
42,TO IANTHE. {1},To such as see thee not my words were weak;
43,TO IANTHE. {1},"To those who gaze on thee, what language could they speak?"
44,TO IANTHE. {1},
45,TO IANTHE. {1},"Ah! mayst thou ever be what now thou art,"
46,TO IANTHE. {1},"Nor unbeseem the promise of thy spring,"
47,TO IANTHE. {1},"As fair in form, as warm yet pure in heart,"
48,TO IANTHE. {1},"Love's image upon earth without his wing,"
49,TO IANTHE. {1},And guileless beyond Hope's imagining!
50,TO IANTHE. {1},And surely she who now so fondly rears
51,TO IANTHE. {1},"Thy youth, in thee, thus hourly brightening,"
52,TO IANTHE. {1},"Beholds the rainbow of her future years,"
53,TO IANTHE. {1},Before whose heavenly hues all sorrow disappears.
54,TO IANTHE. {1},
55,TO IANTHE. {1},Young Peri of the West!--'tis well for me
56,TO IANTHE. {1},My years already doubly number thine;
57,TO IANTHE. {1},"My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee,"
58,TO IANTHE. {1},And safely view thy ripening beauties shine:
59,TO IANTHE. {1},"Happy, I ne'er shall see them in decline;"
60,TO IANTHE. {1},"Happier, that while all younger hearts shall bleed"
61,TO IANTHE. {1},Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign
62,TO IANTHE. {1},"To those whose admiration shall succeed,"
63,TO IANTHE. {1},But mixed with pangs to Love's even loveliest hours decreed.
64,TO IANTHE. {1},
65,TO IANTHE. {1},"Oh! let that eye, which, wild as the gazelle's,"
66,TO IANTHE. {1},"Now brightly bold or beautifully shy,"
67,TO IANTHE. {1},"Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,"
68,TO IANTHE. {1},"Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny"
69,TO IANTHE. {1},"That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh,"
70,TO IANTHE. {1},Could I to thee be ever more than friend:
71,TO IANTHE. {1},"This much, dear maid, accord; nor question why"
72,TO IANTHE. {1},"To one so young my strain I would commend,"
73,TO IANTHE. {1},But bid me with my wreath one matchless lily blend.
74,TO IANTHE. {1},
75,TO IANTHE. {1},Such is thy name with this my verse entwined;
76,TO IANTHE. {1},And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast
77,TO IANTHE. {1},"On Harold's page, Ianthe's here enshrined"
78,TO IANTHE. {1},"Shall thus be first beheld, forgotten last:"
79,TO IANTHE. {1},"My days once numbered, should this homage past"
80,TO IANTHE. {1},Attract thy fairy fingers near the lyre
81,TO IANTHE. {1},"Of him who hailed thee, loveliest as thou wast,"
82,TO IANTHE. {1},Such is the most my memory may desire;
83,TO IANTHE. {1},"Though more than Hope can claim, could Friendship less require?"
84,TO IANTHE. {1},
85,TO IANTHE. {1},

91,CANTO THE FIRST.,
92,I.,I.
93,I.,
94,I.,"Oh, thou, in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,"
95,I.,"Muse, formed or fabled at the minstrel's will!"
96,I.,"Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,"
97,I.,Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill:
98,I.,Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;
99,I.,Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long-deserted shrine
100,I.,"Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;"
101,I.,Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine
102,I.,To grace so plain a tale--this lowly lay of mine.
103,I.,
104,II.,II.
105,II.,
106,II.,"Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,"
107,II.,Who ne in virtue's ways did take delight;
108,II.,"But spent his days in riot most uncouth,"
109,II.,And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.
110,II.,"Ah, me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,"
111,II.,Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;
112,II.,Few earthly things found favour in his sight
113,II.,"Save concubines and carnal companie,"
114,II.,And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.
115,II.,
116,III.,III.
117,III.,
118,III.,Childe Harold was he hight:--but whence his name
119,III.,"And lineage long, it suits me not to say;"
120,III.,"Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,"
121,III.,And had been glorious in another day:
122,III.,"But one sad losel soils a name for aye,"
123,III.,However mighty in the olden time;
124,III.,"Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,"
125,III.,"Nor florid prose, nor honeyed lines of rhyme,"
126,III.,"Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime."
127,III.,
128,IV.,IV.
129,IV.,
130,IV.,"Childe Harold basked him in the noontide sun,"
131,IV.,"Disporting there like any other fly,"
132,IV.,Nor deemed before his little day was done
133,IV.,One blast might chill him into misery.
134,IV.,"But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,"
135,IV.,Worse than adversity the Childe befell;
136,IV.,He felt the fulness of satiety:
137,IV.,"Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,"
138,IV.,Which seemed to him more lone than eremite's sad cell.
139,IV.,
140,V.,V.
141,V.,
142,V.,"For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,"
143,V.,"Nor made atonement when he did amiss,"
144,V.,"Had sighed to many, though he loved but one,"
145,V.,"And that loved one, alas, could ne'er be his."
146,V.,"Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss"
147,V.,Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;
148,V.,"Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,"
149,V.,"And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,"
150,V.,Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.
151,V.,
152,VI.,VI.
153,VI.,
154,VI.,"And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,"
155,VI.,And from his fellow bacchanals would flee;
156,VI.,"'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,"
157,VI.,But pride congealed the drop within his e'e:
158,VI.,"Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,"
159,VI.,"And from his native land resolved to go,"
160,VI.,And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;
161,VI.,"With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,"
162,VI.,And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.
163,VI.,
164,VII.,VII.
165,VII.,
166,VII.,The Childe departed from his father's hall;
167,VII.,It was a vast and venerable pile;
168,VII.,"So old, it seemed only not to fall,"
169,VII.,Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.
170,VII.,Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile!
171,VII.,"Where superstition once had made her den,"
172,VII.,Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;
173,VII.,"And monks might deem their time was come agen,"
174,VII.,"If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men."
175,VII.,
176,VIII.,VIII.
177,VIII.,
178,VIII.,"Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,"
179,VIII.,"Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,"
180,VIII.,As if the memory of some deadly feud
181,VIII.,Or disappointed passion lurked below:
182,VIII.,"But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;"
183,VIII.,"For his was not that open, artless soul"
184,VIII.,That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;
185,VIII.,"Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,"
186,VIII.,"Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control."
187,VIII.,
188,IX.,IX.
189,IX.,
190,IX.,And none did love him:  though to hall and bower
191,IX.,"He gathered revellers from far and near,"
192,IX.,He knew them flatterers of the festal hour;
193,IX.,The heartless parasites of present cheer.
194,IX.,"Yea, none did love him--not his lemans dear--"
195,IX.,"But pomp and power alone are woman's care,"
196,IX.,And where these are light Eros finds a feere;
197,IX.,"Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,"
198,IX.,And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.
199,IX.,
200,X.,X.
201,X.,
202,X.,"Childe Harold had a mother--not forgot,"
203,X.,Though parting from that mother he did shun;
204,X.,"A sister whom he loved, but saw her not"
205,X.,Before his weary pilgrimage begun:
206,X.,"If friends he had, he bade adieu to none."
207,X.,Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel;
208,X.,"Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon"
209,X.,"A few dear objects, will in sadness feel"
210,X.,Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.
211,X.,
212,XI.,XI.
213,XI.,
214,XI.,"His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,"
215,XI.,"The laughing dames in whom he did delight,"
216,XI.,"Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,"
217,XI.,"Might shake the saintship of an anchorite,"
218,XI.,And long had fed his youthful appetite;
219,XI.,"His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,"
220,XI.,"And all that mote to luxury invite,"
221,XI.,"Without a sigh he left to cross the brine,"
222,XI.,"And traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line."
223,XI.,
224,XII.,XII.
225,XII.,
226,XII.,"The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew"
227,XII.,As glad to waft him from his native home;
228,XII.,"And fast the white rocks faded from his view,"
229,XII.,And soon were lost in circumambient foam;
230,XII.,"And then, it may be, of his wish to roam"
231,XII.,"Repented he, but in his bosom slept"
232,XII.,"The silent thought, nor from his lips did come"
233,XII.,"One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,"
234,XII.,And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.
235,XII.,
236,XIII.,XIII.
237,XIII.,
238,XIII.,"But when the sun was sinking in the sea,"
239,XIII.,"He seized his harp, which he at times could string,"
240,XIII.,"And strike, albeit with untaught melody,"
241,XIII.,When deemed he no strange ear was listening:
242,XIII.,"And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,"
243,XIII.,"And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight,"
244,XIII.,"While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,"
245,XIII.,"And fleeting shores receded from his sight,"
246,XIII.,Thus to the elements he poured his last 'Good Night.'
247,XIII.,
248,XIII.,"Adieu, adieu! my native shore"
249,XIII.,Fades o'er the waters blue;
250,XIII.,"The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,"
251,XIII.,And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
252,XIII.,Yon sun that sets upon the sea
253,XIII.,We follow in his flight;
254,XIII.,"Farewell awhile to him and thee,"
255,XIII.,My Native Land--Good Night!
256,XIII.,
257,XIII.,"A few short hours, and he will rise"
258,XIII.,To give the morrow birth;
259,XIII.,"And I shall hail the main and skies,"
260,XIII.,But not my mother earth.
261,XIII.,"Deserted is my own good hall,"
262,XIII.,Its hearth is desolate;
263,XIII.,"Wild weeds are gathering on the wall,"
264,XIII.,My dog howls at the gate.
265,XIII.,
266,XIII.,"'Come hither, hither, my little page:"
267,XIII.,Why dost thou weep and wail?
268,XIII.,"Or dost thou dread the billow's rage,"
269,XIII.,Or tremble at the gale?
270,XIII.,"But dash the tear-drop from thine eye,"
271,XIII.,Our ship is swift and strong;
272,XIII.,Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
273,XIII.,More merrily along.'
274,XIII.,
275,XIII.,"'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,"
276,XIII.,I fear not wave nor wind;
277,XIII.,"Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I"
278,XIII.,Am sorrowful in mind;
279,XIII.,"For I have from my father gone,"
280,XIII.,"A mother whom I love,"
281,XIII.,"And have no friend, save these alone,"
282,XIII.,But thee--and One above.
283,XIII.,
284,XIII.,"'My father blessed me fervently,"
285,XIII.,Yet did not much complain;
286,XIII.,But sorely will my mother sigh
287,XIII.,Till I come back again.'--
288,XIII.,"'Enough, enough, my little lad!"
289,XIII.,Such tears become thine eye;
290,XIII.,"If I thy guileless bosom had,"
291,XIII.,Mine own would not be dry.
292,XIII.,
293,XIII.,"'Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,"
294,XIII.,Why dost thou look so pale?
295,XIII.,"Or dost thou dread a French foeman,"
296,XIII.,Or shiver at the gale?'--
297,XIII.,'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
298,XIII.,"Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;"
299,XIII.,But thinking on an absent wife
300,XIII.,Will blanch a faithful cheek.
301,XIII.,
302,XIII.,"'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,"
303,XIII.,Along the bordering lake;
304,XIII.,"And when they on their father call,"
305,XIII.,What answer shall she make?'--
306,XIII.,"'Enough, enough, my yeoman good,"
307,XIII.,Thy grief let none gainsay;
308,XIII.,"But I, who am of lighter mood,"
309,XIII.,Will laugh to flee away.'
310,XIII.,
311,XIII.,For who would trust the seeming sighs
312,XIII.,Of wife or paramour?
313,XIII.,Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
314,XIII.,We late saw streaming o'er.
315,XIII.,"For pleasures past I do not grieve,"
316,XIII.,Nor perils gathering near;
317,XIII.,My greatest grief is that I leave
318,XIII.,No thing that claims a tear.
319,XIII.,
320,XIII.,"And now I'm in the world alone,"
321,XIII.,"Upon the wide, wide sea;"
322,XIII.,"But why should I for others groan,"
323,XIII.,When none will sigh for me?
324,XIII.,Perchance my dog will whine in vain
325,XIII.,Till fed by stranger hands;
326,XIII.,But long ere I come back again
327,XIII.,He'd tear me where he stands.
328,XIII.,
329,XIII.,"With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go"
330,XIII.,Athwart the foaming brine;
331,XIII.,"Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,"
332,XIII.,So not again to mine.
333,XIII.,"Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!"
334,XIII.,"And when you fail my sight,"
335,XIII.,"Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!"
336,XIII.,My Native Land--Good Night!
337,XIII.,
338,XIV.,XIV.
339,XIV.,
340,XIV.,"On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,"
341,XIV.,And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
342,XIV.,"Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,"
343,XIV.,New shores descried make every bosom gay;
344,XIV.,"And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,"
345,XIV.,"And Tagus dashing onward to the deep,"
346,XIV.,His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;
347,XIV.,"And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,"
348,XIV.,And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.
349,XIV.,
350,XV.,XV.
351,XV.,
352,XV.,"Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see"
353,XV.,What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
354,XV.,What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
355,XV.,What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
356,XV.,But man would mar them with an impious hand:
357,XV.,And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
358,XV.,"'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,"
359,XV.,With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
360,XV.,"Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge."
361,XV.,
362,XVI.,XVI.
363,XVI.,
364,XVI.,What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!
365,XVI.,"Her image floating on that noble tide,"
366,XVI.,"Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,"
367,XVI.,But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
368,XVI.,"Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,"
369,XVI.,And to the Lusians did her aid afford
370,XVI.,"A nation swoll'n with ignorance and pride,"
371,XVI.,"Who lick, yet loathe, the hand that waves the sword."
372,XVI.,To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.
373,XVI.,
374,XVII.,XVII.
375,XVII.,
376,XVII.,"But whoso entereth within this town,"
377,XVII.,"That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,"
378,XVII.,"Disconsolate will wander up and down,"
379,XVII.,Mid many things unsightly to strange e'e;
380,XVII.,For hut and palace show like filthily;
381,XVII.,The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
382,XVII.,No personage of high or mean degree
383,XVII.,"Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,"
384,XVII.,"Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt."
385,XVII.,
386,XVIII.,XVIII.
387,XVIII.,
388,XVIII.,"Poor, paltry slaves! yet born midst noblest scenes--"
389,XVIII.,"Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?"
390,XVIII.,Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes
391,XVIII.,In variegated maze of mount and glen.
392,XVIII.,"Ah me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,"
393,XVIII.,To follow half on which the eye dilates
394,XVIII.,Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken
395,XVIII.,"Than those whereof such things the bard relates,"
396,XVIII.,Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates?
397,XVIII.,
398,XIX.,XIX.
399,XIX.,
400,XIX.,"The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,"
401,XIX.,"The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,"
402,XIX.,"The mountain moss by scorching skies imbrowned,"
403,XIX.,"The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,"
404,XIX.,"The tender azure of the unruffled deep,"
405,XIX.,"The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,"
406,XIX.,"The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,"
407,XIX.,"The vine on high, the willow branch below,"
408,XIX.,"Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow."
409,XIX.,
410,XX.,XX.
411,XX.,
412,XX.,"Then slowly climb the many-winding way,"
413,XX.,"And frequent turn to linger as you go,"
414,XX.,"From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,"
415,XX.,And rest ye at 'Our Lady's House of Woe;'
416,XX.,"Where frugal monks their little relics show,"
417,XX.,And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
418,XX.,"Here impious men have punished been; and lo,"
419,XX.,"Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,"
420,XX.,In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.
421,XX.,
422,XXI.,XXI.
423,XXI.,
424,XXI.,"And here and there, as up the crags you spring,"
425,XXI.,Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path;
426,XXI.,Yet deem not these devotion's offering--
427,XXI.,These are memorials frail of murderous wrath;
428,XXI.,For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
429,XXI.,"Poured forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,"
430,XXI.,Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
431,XXI.,And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
432,XXI.,"Throughout this purple land, where law secures not life!"
433,XXI.,
434,XXII.,XXII.
435,XXII.,
436,XXII.,"On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,"
437,XXII.,Are domes where whilom kings did make repair;
438,XXII.,But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
439,XXII.,Yet ruined splendour still is lingering there.
440,XXII.,And yonder towers the prince's palace fair:
441,XXII.,"There thou, too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,"
442,XXII.,"Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware"
443,XXII.,"When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,"
444,XXII.,Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.
445,XXII.,
446,XXIII.,XXIII.
447,XXIII.,
448,XXIII.,"Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan."
449,XXIII.,Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow;
450,XXIII.,"But now, as if a thing unblest by man,"
451,XXIII.,Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!
452,XXIII.,Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
453,XXIII.,"To halls deserted, portals gaping wide;"
454,XXIII.,"Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how"
455,XXIII.,Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
456,XXIII.,Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide.
457,XXIII.,
458,XXIV.,XXIV.
459,XXIV.,
460,XXIV.,Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!
461,XXIV.,Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
462,XXIV.,"With diadem hight foolscap, lo! a fiend,"
463,XXIV.,"A little fiend that scoffs incessantly,"
464,XXIV.,"There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by"
465,XXIV.,"His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,"
466,XXIV.,"Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,"
467,XXIV.,"And sundry signatures adorn the roll,"
468,XXIV.,"Whereat the urchin points, and laughs with all his soul."
469,XXIV.,
470,XXV.,XXV.
471,XXV.,
472,XXV.,Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
473,XXV.,That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
474,XXV.,"Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,"
475,XXV.,And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.

2225,LXXII.,To his snowy camese and his shaggy capote?
2226,LXXII.,"To the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,"

2228,LXXII.,
2229,LXXII.,"Shall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive"

2231,LXXII.,Let those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?
2232,LXXII.,What mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?

2627,III.,O'er which all heavily the journeying years
2628,III.,Plod the last sands of life--where not a flower appears.
2629,III.,
2630,IV.,IV.
2631,IV.,
2632,IV.,"Since my young days of passion--joy, or pain,"
2633,IV.,"Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string,"
2634,IV.,"And both may jar:  it may be, that in vain"
2635,IV.,I would essay as I have sung to sing.
2636,IV.,"Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling,"
2637,IV.,So that it wean me from the weary dream
2638,IV.,Of selfish grief or gladness--so it fling
2639,IV.,Forgetfulness around me--it shall seem
2640,IV.,"To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme."
2641,IV.,
2642,V.,V.
2643,V.,
2644,V.,"He who, grown aged in this world of woe,"
2645,V.,"In deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,"
2646,V.,So that no wonder waits him; nor below
2647,V.,"Can love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,"
2648,V.,Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
2649,V.,"Of silent, sharp endurance:  he can tell"
2650,V.,"Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife"
2651,V.,"With airy images, and shapes which dwell"
2652,V.,"Still unimpaired, though old, in the soul's haunted cell."
2653,V.,
2654,VI.,VI.
2655,VI.,
2656,VI.,"'Tis to create, and in creating live"
2657,VI.,"A being more intense, that we endow"
2658,VI.,"With form our fancy, gaining as we give"
2659,VI.,"The life we image, even as I do now."
2660,VI.,"What am I?  Nothing:  but not so art thou,"
2661,VI.,"Soul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,"
2662,VI.,"Invisible but gazing, as I glow"
2663,VI.,"Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,"
2664,VI.,And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.
2665,VI.,
2666,VII.,VII.
2667,VII.,
2668,VII.,Yet must I think less wildly:  I HAVE thought
2669,VII.,"Too long and darkly, till my brain became,"
2670,VII.,"In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,"
2671,VII.,A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:
2672,VII.,"And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,"
2673,VII.,My springs of life were poisoned.  'Tis too late!
2674,VII.,Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
2675,VII.,"In strength to bear what time cannot abate,"
2676,VII.,And feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate.
2677,VII.,
2678,VIII.,VIII.
2679,VIII.,
2680,VIII.,"Something too much of this:  but now 'tis past,"
2681,VIII.,And the spell closes with its silent seal.
2682,VIII.,Long-absent Harold reappears at last;
2683,VIII.,"He of the breast which fain no more would feel,"
2684,VIII.,"Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;"
2685,VIII.,"Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him"
2686,VIII.,In soul and aspect as in age:  years steal
2687,VIII.,Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb;
2688,VIII.,And life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.
2689,VIII.,
2690,IX.,IX.
2691,IX.,
2692,IX.,"His had been quaffed too quickly, and he found"
2693,IX.,"The dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,"
2694,IX.,"And from a purer fount, on holier ground,"
2695,IX.,And deemed its spring perpetual; but in vain!
2696,IX.,Still round him clung invisibly a chain
2697,IX.,"Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,"
2698,IX.,"And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,"
2699,IX.,"Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,"
2700,IX.,Entering with every step he took through many a scene.
2701,IX.,
2702,X.,X.
2703,X.,
2704,X.,"Secure in guarded coldness, he had mixed"
2705,X.,"Again in fancied safety with his kind,"
2706,X.,And deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed
2707,X.,"And sheathed with an invulnerable mind,"
2708,X.,"That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;"
2709,X.,"And he, as one, might midst the many stand"
2710,X.,"Unheeded, searching through the crowd to find"
2711,X.,Fit speculation; such as in strange land
2712,X.,He found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.
2713,X.,
2714,XI.,XI.
2715,XI.,
2716,XI.,"But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek"
2717,XI.,To wear it? who can curiously behold
2718,XI.,"The smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek,"
2719,XI.,Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?
2720,XI.,Who can contemplate fame through clouds unfold
2721,XI.,"The star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?"
2722,XI.,"Harold, once more within the vortex rolled"
2723,XI.,"On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,"
2724,XI.,Yet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime.
2725,XI.,
2726,XII.,XII.
2727,XII.,
2728,XII.,But soon he knew himself the most unfit
2729,XII.,Of men to herd with Man; with whom he held
2730,XII.,Little in common; untaught to submit
2731,XII.,"His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled,"
2732,XII.,"In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,"
2733,XII.,He would not yield dominion of his mind
2734,XII.,To spirits against whom his own rebelled;
2735,XII.,Proud though in desolation; which could find
2736,XII.,"A life within itself, to breathe without mankind."
2737,XII.,
2738,XIII.,XIII.
2739,XIII.,
2740,XIII.,"Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;"
2741,XIII.,"Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;"
2742,XIII.,"Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,"
2743,XIII.,He had the passion and the power to roam;
2744,XIII.,"The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,"
2745,XIII.,Were unto him companionship; they spake
2746,XIII.,"A mutual language, clearer than the tome"
2747,XIII.,"Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake"
2748,XIII.,For nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.
2749,XIII.,
2750,XIV.,XIV.
2751,XIV.,
2752,XIV.,"Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,"
2753,XIV.,Till he had peopled them with beings bright
2754,XIV.,"As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,"
2755,XIV.,"And human frailties, were forgotten quite:"
2756,XIV.,"Could he have kept his spirit to that flight,"
2757,XIV.,He had been happy; but this clay will sink
2758,XIV.,"Its spark immortal, envying it the light"
2759,XIV.,"To which it mounts, as if to break the link"
2760,XIV.,That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.
2761,XIV.,
2762,XV.,XV.
2763,XV.,
2764,XV.,But in Man's dwellings he became a thing
2765,XV.,"Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,"
2766,XV.,"Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,"
2767,XV.,To whom the boundless air alone were home:
2768,XV.,"Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,"
2769,XV.,As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat
2770,XV.,His breast and beak against his wiry dome
2771,XV.,"Till the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat"
2772,XV.,Of his impeded soul would through his bosom eat.
2773,XV.,
2774,XVI.,XVI.
2775,XVI.,
2776,XVI.,"Self-exiled Harold wanders forth again,"
2777,XVI.,"With naught of hope left, but with less of gloom;"
2778,XVI.,"The very knowledge that he lived in vain,"
2779,XVI.,"That all was over on this side the tomb,"
2780,XVI.,"Had made Despair a smilingness assume,"
2781,XVI.,"Which, though 'twere wild--as on the plundered wreck"
2782,XVI.,When mariners would madly meet their doom
2783,XVI.,With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck--
2784,XVI.,"Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check."
2785,XVI.,
2786,XVII.,XVII.
2787,XVII.,
2788,XVII.,Stop! for thy tread is on an empire's dust!
2789,XVII.,An earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!
2790,XVII.,Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?
2791,XVII.,Nor column trophied for triumphal show?
2792,XVII.,"None; but the moral's truth tells simpler so,"
2793,XVII.,"As the ground was before, thus let it be;--"
2794,XVII.,How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
2795,XVII.,"And is this all the world has gained by thee,"
2796,XVII.,Thou first and last of fields! king-making Victory?
2797,XVII.,
2798,XVIII.,XVIII.
2799,XVIII.,
2800,XVIII.,"And Harold stands upon this place of skulls,"
2801,XVIII.,"The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!"
2802,XVIII.,How in an hour the power which gave annuls
2803,XVIII.,"Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!"
2804,XVIII.,"In 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,"
2805,XVIII.,"Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,"
2806,XVIII.,Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through:
2807,XVIII.,Ambition's life and labours all were vain;
2808,XVIII.,He wears the shattered links of the world's broken chain.
2809,XVIII.,
2810,XIX.,XIX.
2811,XIX.,
2812,XIX.,"Fit retribution!  Gaul may champ the bit,"
2813,XIX.,"And foam in fetters, but is Earth more free?"
2814,XIX.,Did nations combat to make ONE submit;
2815,XIX.,Or league to teach all kings true sovereignty?
2816,XIX.,What! shall reviving thraldom again be
2817,XIX.,The patched-up idol of enlightened days?
2818,XIX.,"Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we"
2819,XIX.,Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze

2822,XX.,XX.
2823,XX.,
2824,XX.,"If not, o'er one fall'n despot boast no more!"
2825,XX.,In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears
2826,XX.,For Europe's flowers long rooted up before
2827,XX.,The trampler of her vineyards; in vain years
2828,XX.,"Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,"
2829,XX.,"Have all been borne, and broken by the accord"
2830,XX.,Of roused-up millions:  all that most endears
2831,XX.,"Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword"
2832,XX.,Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant lord.
2833,XX.,
2834,XXI.,XXI.
2835,XXI.,
2836,XXI.,"There was a sound of revelry by night,"
2837,XXI.,And Belgium's capital had gathered then
2838,XXI.,"Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright"
2839,XXI.,The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
2840,XXI.,A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
2841,XXI.,"Music arose with its voluptuous swell,"
2842,XXI.,"Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,"
2843,XXI.,And all went merry as a marriage bell;
2844,XXI.,But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

2846,XXII.,XXII.
2847,XXII.,
2848,XXII.,"Did ye not hear it?--No; 'twas but the wind,"

2850,XXII.,On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
2851,XXII.,"No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet"
2852,XXII.,To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet.
2853,XXII.,"But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,"
2854,XXII.,As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
2855,XXII.,"And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!"

2857,XXII.,
2858,XXIII.,XXIII.
2859,XXIII.,
2860,XXIII.,Within a windowed niche of that high hall
2861,XXIII.,Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear
2862,XXIII.,"That sound, the first amidst the festival,"
2863,XXIII.,And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
2864,XXIII.,"And when they smiled because he deemed it near,"
2865,XXIII.,His heart more truly knew that peal too well
2866,XXIII.,"Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,"
2867,XXIII.,And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:
2868,XXIII.,"He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell."

2878,XXIV.,Which ne'er might be repeated:  who would guess
2879,XXIV.,"If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,"

2881,XXIV.,
2882,XXV.,XXV.

2887,XXV.,And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
2888,XXV.,And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
2889,XXV.,"And near, the beat of the alarming drum"
2890,XXV.,Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
2891,XXV.,"While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,"

2899,XXVI.,How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills
2900,XXVI.,Savage and shrill!  But with the breath which fills
2901,XXVI.,"Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers"
2902,XXVI.,With the fierce native daring which instils
2903,XXVI.,"The stirring memory of a thousand years,"

2912,XXVII.,Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
2913,XXVII.,"Which now beneath them, but above shall grow"
2914,XXVII.,"In its next verdure, when this fiery mass"
2915,XXVII.,"Of living valour, rolling on the foe,"

3083,XLI.,Like stern Diogenes to mock at men;

4788,LXI.,My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields
4789,LXI.,Than Art in galleries:  though a work divine
4790,LXI.,"Calls for my spirit's homage, yet it yields"
4791,LXI.,"Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields"
4792,LXI.,
4793,LXII.,LXII.
4794,LXII.,
4795,LXII.,"Is of another temper, and I roam"
4796,LXII.,"By Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles"
4797,LXII.,"Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;"
4798,LXII.,For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles
4799,LXII.,"Come back before me, as his skill beguiles"
4800,LXII.,"The host between the mountains and the shore,"
4801,LXII.,"Where Courage falls in her despairing files,"
4802,LXII.,"And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,"
4803,LXII.,"Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er,"
4804,LXII.,
4805,LXIII.,LXIII.
4806,LXIII.,
4807,LXIII.,Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;
4808,LXIII.,"And such the storm of battle on this day,"
4809,LXIII.,"And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds"
4810,LXIII.,"To all save carnage, that, beneath the fray,"
4811,LXIII.,An earthquake reeled unheededly away!
4812,LXIII.,"None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,"
4813,LXIII.,And yawning forth a grave for those who lay
4814,LXIII.,Upon their bucklers for a winding-sheet;
4815,LXIII.,Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet.

4817,LXIV.,LXIV.
4818,LXIV.,
4819,LXIV.,The Earth to them was as a rolling bark
4820,LXIV.,Which bore them to Eternity; they saw
4821,LXIV.,"The Ocean round, but had no time to mark"
4822,LXIV.,"The motions of their vessel:  Nature's law,"
4823,LXIV.,"In them suspended, recked not of the awe"
4824,LXIV.,"Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds"
4825,LXIV.,"Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw"
4826,LXIV.,From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
4827,LXIV.,"Stumble o'er heaving plains, and man's dread hath no words."

4831,LXV.,Far other scene is Thrasimene now;
4832,LXV.,"Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain"
4833,LXV.,Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;
4834,LXV.,Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain
4835,LXV.,Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en--
4836,LXV.,A little rill of scanty stream and bed--
4837,LXV.,A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;
4838,LXV.,And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead
4839,LXV.,"Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red."
4840,LXV.,
4841,LXVI.,LXVI.
4842,LXVI.,
4843,LXVI.,"But thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave"
4844,LXVI.,Of the most living crystal that was e'er
4845,LXVI.,"The haunt of river nymph, to gaze and lave"
4846,LXVI.,"Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear"
4847,LXVI.,Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer
4848,LXVI.,Grazes; the purest god of gentle waters!
4849,LXVI.,"And most serene of aspect, and most clear:"
4850,LXVI.,"Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters,"
4851,LXVI.,A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!
4852,LXVI.,
4853,LXVII.,LXVII.
4854,LXVII.,
4855,LXVII.,"And on thy happy shore a temple still,"
4856,LXVII.,"Of small and delicate proportion, keeps,"
4857,LXVII.,"Upon a mild declivity of hill,"
4858,LXVII.,Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps
4859,LXVII.,Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps
4860,LXVII.,"The finny darter with the glittering scales,"
4861,LXVII.,Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;
4862,LXVII.,"While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails"
4863,LXVII.,Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.

4870,LXVIII.,"Along his margin a more eloquent green,"
4871,LXVIII.,If on the heart the freshness of the scene
4872,LXVIII.,"Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust"
4873,LXVIII.,Of weary life a moment lave it clean
4874,LXVIII.,"With Nature's baptism,--'tis to him ye must"

4876,LXVIII.,
4877,LXIX.,LXIX.
4878,LXIX.,
4879,LXIX.,The roar of waters!--from the headlong height
4880,LXIX.,Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
4881,LXIX.,The fall of waters! rapid as the light
4882,LXIX.,The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;
4883,LXIX.,"The hell of waters! where they howl and hiss,"
4884,LXIX.,And boil in endless torture; while the sweat
4885,LXIX.,"Of their great agony, wrung out from this"
4886,LXIX.,"Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet"
4887,LXIX.,"That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,"

4889,LXX.,LXX.
4890,LXX.,
4891,LXX.,"And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again"

4893,LXX.,"With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,"
4894,LXX.,"Is an eternal April to the ground,"
4895,LXX.,Making it all one emerald.  How profound
4896,LXX.,The gulf! and how the giant element
4897,LXX.,"From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,"
4898,LXX.,"Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent"
4899,LXX.,"With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent"
4900,LXX.,
4901,LXXI.,LXXI.
4902,LXXI.,
4903,LXXI.,"To the broad column which rolls on, and shows"
4904,LXXI.,More like the fountain of an infant sea
4905,LXXI.,Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes
4906,LXXI.,"Of a new world, than only thus to be"
4907,LXXI.,"Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,"
4908,LXXI.,With many windings through the vale:--Look back!
4909,LXXI.,"Lo! where it comes like an eternity,"
4910,LXXI.,"As if to sweep down all things in its track,"
4911,LXXI.,"Charming the eye with dread,--a matchless cataract,"

4913,LXXII.,LXXII.
4914,LXXII.,
4915,LXXII.,"Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,"
4916,LXXII.,"From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,"

4921,LXXII.,Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
4922,LXXII.,"Resembling, mid the torture of the scene,"

4930,LXXIII.,"Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar"
4931,LXXIII.,The thundering lauwine--might be worshipped more;
4932,LXXIII.,But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear
4933,LXXIII.,"Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar"
4934,LXXIII.,"Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near,"

4939,LXXIV.,The Acroceraunian mountains of old name;
4940,LXXIV.,And on Parnassus seen the eagles fly

4942,LXXIV.,For still they soared unutterably high:
4943,LXXIV.,I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;
4944,LXXIV.,"Athos, Olympus, AEtna, Atlas, made"
4945,LXXIV.,"These hills seem things of lesser dignity,"

4951,LXXV.,"For our remembrance, and from out the plain"

4953,LXXV.,And on the curl hangs pausing:  not in vain
4954,LXXV.,"May he who will his recollections rake,"
4955,LXXV.,"And quote in classic raptures, and awake"
4956,LXXV.,The hills with Latian echoes; I abhorred
4957,LXXV.,"Too much, to conquer for the poet's sake,"
4958,LXXV.,"The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word"

4961,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
4962,LXXVI.,
4963,LXXVI.,Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned
4964,LXXVI.,"My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught"
4965,LXXVI.,"My mind to meditate what then it learned,"
4966,LXXVI.,Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought
4967,LXXVI.,"By the impatience of my early thought,"
4968,LXXVI.,"That, with the freshness wearing out before"
4969,LXXVI.,"My mind could relish what it might have sought,"
4970,LXXVI.,"If free to choose, I cannot now restore"

5632,CXXXI.,
5633,CXXXII.,CXXXII.
5634,CXXXII.,
5635,CXXXII.,"And thou, who never yet of human wrong"
5636,CXXXII.,"Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!"
5637,CXXXII.,"Here, where the ancients paid thee homage long--"
5638,CXXXII.,"Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,"
5639,CXXXII.,And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
5640,CXXXII.,"For that unnatural retribution--just,"
5641,CXXXII.,Had it but been from hands less near--in this
5642,CXXXII.,"Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!"
5643,CXXXII.,"Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake! thou shalt, and must."

5645,CXXXIII.,CXXXIII.
5646,CXXXIII.,
5647,CXXXIII.,It is not that I may not have incurred
5648,CXXXIII.,For my ancestral faults or mine the wound
5649,CXXXIII.,"I bleed withal, and had it been conferred"
5650,CXXXIII.,"With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound."
5651,CXXXIII.,But now my blood shall not sink in the ground;
5652,CXXXIII.,To thee I do devote it--THOU shalt take
5653,CXXXIII.,"The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found,"
5654,CXXXIII.,Which if _I_ have not taken for the sake--
5655,CXXXIII.,"But let that pass--I sleep, but thou shalt yet awake."

5658,CXXXIV.,
5659,CXXXIV.,"And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now"
5660,CXXXIV.,I shrink from what is suffered:  let him speak
5661,CXXXIV.,"Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,"
5662,CXXXIV.,Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
5663,CXXXIV.,But in this page a record will I seek.
5664,CXXXIV.,"Not in the air shall these my words disperse,"
5665,CXXXIV.,Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
5666,CXXXIV.,"The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,"
5667,CXXXIV.,And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!
5668,CXXXIV.,
5669,CXXXV.,CXXXV.
5670,CXXXV.,
5671,CXXXV.,That curse shall be forgiveness.--Have I not--
5672,CXXXV.,"Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!--"
5673,CXXXV.,Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?
5674,CXXXV.,Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
5675,CXXXV.,"Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,"
5676,CXXXV.,"Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?"
5677,CXXXV.,"And only not to desperation driven,"
5678,CXXXV.,Because not altogether of such clay
5679,CXXXV.,As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.
5680,CXXXV.,
5681,CXXXVI.,CXXXVI.
5682,CXXXVI.,
5683,CXXXVI.,From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
5684,CXXXVI.,Have I not seen what human things could do?
5685,CXXXVI.,From the loud roar of foaming calumny
5686,CXXXVI.,To the small whisper of the as paltry few
5687,CXXXVI.,"And subtler venom of the reptile crew,"
5688,CXXXVI.,"The Janus glance of whose significant eye,"
5689,CXXXVI.,"Learning to lie with silence, would SEEM true,"
5690,CXXXVI.,"And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,"
5691,CXXXVI.,Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.

5695,CXXXVII.,"But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:"
5696,CXXXVII.,"My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,"
5697,CXXXVII.,"And my frame perish even in conquering pain,"
5698,CXXXVII.,But there is that within me which shall tire
5699,CXXXVII.,"Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire:"
5700,CXXXVII.,"Something unearthly, which they deem not of,"
5701,CXXXVII.,"Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,"
5702,CXXXVII.,"Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move"

5709,CXXXVIII.,Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
5710,CXXXVIII.,"With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear:"
5711,CXXXVIII.,Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
5712,CXXXVIII.,"Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene"
5713,CXXXVIII.,Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
5714,CXXXVIII.,"That we become a part of what has been,"
5715,CXXXVIII.,"And grow unto the spot, all-seeing but unseen."
5716,CXXXVIII.,
5717,CXXXIX.,CXXXIX.

5719,CXXXIX.,"And here the buzz of eager nations ran,"
5720,CXXXIX.,"In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,"
5721,CXXXIX.,As man was slaughtered by his fellow-man.
5722,CXXXIX.,"And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because"
5723,CXXXIX.,"Such were the bloody circus' genial laws,"
5724,CXXXIX.,And the imperial pleasure.--Wherefore not?
5725,CXXXIX.,What matters where we fall to fill the maws
5726,CXXXIX.,Of worms--on battle-plains or listed spot?
5727,CXXXIX.,Both are but theatres where the chief actors rot.
5728,CXXXIX.,

5730,CXL.,
5731,CXL.,I see before me the Gladiator lie:
5732,CXL.,He leans upon his hand--his manly brow
5733,CXL.,"Consents to death, but conquers agony,"
5734,CXL.,And his drooped head sinks gradually low--
5735,CXL.,"And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow"
5736,CXL.,"From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,"
5737,CXL.,Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
5738,CXL.,"The arena swims around him:  he is gone,"
5739,CXL.,Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.

5743,CXLI.,"He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes"

5745,CXLI.,"He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,"
5746,CXLI.,"But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,"
5747,CXLI.,"THERE were his young barbarians all at play,"
5748,CXLI.,"THERE was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,"
5749,CXLI.,Butchered to make a Roman holiday--
5750,CXLI.,"All this rushed with his blood--Shall he expire,"
5751,CXLI.,"And unavenged?--Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!"
5752,CXLI.,
5753,CXLII.,CXLII.

5755,CXLII.,"But here, where murder breathed her bloody steam;"
5756,CXLII.,"And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,"
5757,CXLII.,And roared or murmured like a mountain-stream
5758,CXLII.,Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
5759,CXLII.,"Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise"
5760,CXLII.,"Was death or life, the playthings of a crowd,"
5761,CXLII.,My voice sounds much--and fall the stars' faint rays
5762,CXLII.,"On the arena void--seats crushed, walls bowed,"
5763,CXLII.,"And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud."
5764,CXLII.,

5767,CXLIII.,A ruin--yet what ruin! from its mass
5768,CXLIII.,"Walls, palaces, half-cities, have been reared;"
5769,CXLIII.,"Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,"
5770,CXLIII.,And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.
5771,CXLIII.,"Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?"
5772,CXLIII.,"Alas! developed, opens the decay,"
5773,CXLIII.,When the colossal fabric's form is neared:
5774,CXLIII.,"It will not bear the brightness of the day,"

5781,CXLIV.,"When the stars twinkle through the loops of time,"
5782,CXLIV.,"And the low night-breeze waves along the air,"
5783,CXLIV.,"The garland-forest, which the grey walls wear,"
5784,CXLIV.,Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head;
5785,CXLIV.,"When the light shines serene, but doth not glare,"
5786,CXLIV.,Then in this magic circle raise the dead:

5831,CXLVIII.,It is not so:  I see them full and plain--
5832,CXLVIII.,"An old man, and a female young and fair,"

6051,CLXVI.,These fardels of the heart--the heart whose sweat was gore.
6052,CLXVI.,
6053,CLXVII.,CLXVII.
6054,CLXVII.,
6055,CLXVII.,"Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,"
6056,CLXVII.,"A long, low distant murmur of dread sound,"
6057,CLXVII.,Such as arises when a nation bleeds
6058,CLXVII.,With some deep and immedicable wound;
6059,CLXVII.,Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground.
6060,CLXVII.,"The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the chief"
6061,CLXVII.,"Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,"
6062,CLXVII.,"And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief"
6063,CLXVII.,"She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief."

6065,CLXVIII.,CLXVIII.
6066,CLXVIII.,
6067,CLXVIII.,"Scion of chiefs and monarchs, where art thou?"
6068,CLXVIII.,"Fond hope of many nations, art thou dead?"
6069,CLXVIII.,"Could not the grave forget thee, and lay low"
6070,CLXVIII.,"Some less majestic, less beloved head?"
6071,CLXVIII.,"In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,"
6072,CLXVIII.,"The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,"
6073,CLXVIII.,Death hushed that pang for ever:  with thee fled
6074,CLXVIII.,The present happiness and promised joy
6075,CLXVIII.,Which filled the imperial isles so full it seemed to cloy.

6081,CLXIX.,"Those who weep not for kings shall weep for thee,"
6082,CLXIX.,"And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard"
6083,CLXIX.,Her many griefs for One; for she had poured
6084,CLXIX.,"Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head"
6085,CLXIX.,"Beheld her Iris.--Thou, too, lonely lord,"
6086,CLXIX.,And desolate consort--vainly wert thou wed!

6089,CLXX.,CLXX.
6090,CLXX.,
6091,CLXX.,Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made:
6092,CLXX.,Thy bridal's fruit is ashes; in the dust
6093,CLXX.,"The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,"
6094,CLXX.,The love of millions!  How we did entrust
6095,CLXX.,"Futurity to her! and, though it must"
6096,CLXX.,"Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed"
6097,CLXX.,"Our children should obey her child, and blessed"
6098,CLXX.,"Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed"

6101,CLXXI.,CLXXI.
6102,CLXXI.,
6103,CLXXI.,"Woe unto us, not her; for she sleeps well:"
6104,CLXXI.,"The fickle reek of popular breath, the tongue"
6105,CLXXI.,"Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,"
6106,CLXXI.,Which from the birth of monarchy hath rung
6107,CLXXI.,"Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstrung"
6108,CLXXI.,"Nations have armed in madness, the strange fate"
6109,CLXXI.,"Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns, and hath flung"
6110,CLXXI.,Against their blind omnipotence a weight
6111,CLXXI.,"Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late,--"

6117,CLXXII.,"Good without effort, great without a foe;"
6118,CLXXII.,But now a bride and mother--and now THERE!
6119,CLXXII.,How many ties did that stern moment tear!
6120,CLXXII.,From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast
6121,CLXXII.,"Is linked the electric chain of that despair,"
6122,CLXXII.,"Whose shock was as an earthquake's, and oppressed"

6129,CLXXIII.,"The oak from his foundation, and which spills"
6130,CLXXIII.,"The ocean o'er its boundary, and bears"
6131,CLXXIII.,"Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares"
6132,CLXXIII.,The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;
6133,CLXXIII.,"And, calm as cherished hate, its surface wears"
6134,CLXXIII.,"A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,"
6135,CLXXIII.,"All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake."

6137,CLXXIV.,CLXXIV.
6138,CLXXIV.,
6139,CLXXIV.,And near Albano's scarce divided waves
6140,CLXXIV.,Shine from a sister valley;--and afar
6141,CLXXIV.,"The Tiber winds, and the broad ocean laves"
6142,CLXXIV.,"The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,"
6143,CLXXIV.,"'Arms and the Man,' whose reascending star"
6144,CLXXIV.,"Rose o'er an empire,--but beneath thy right"
6145,CLXXIV.,Tully reposed from Rome;--and where yon bar
6146,CLXXIV.,"Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight,"

6153,CLXXV.,His task and mine alike are nearly done;
6154,CLXXV.,Yet once more let us look upon the sea:
6155,CLXXV.,"The midland ocean breaks on him and me,"
6156,CLXXV.,And from the Alban mount we now behold
6157,CLXXV.,"Our friend of youth, that ocean, which when we"
6158,CLXXV.,Beheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold
6159,CLXXV.,"Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled"
6160,CLXXV.,
6161,CLXXVI.,CLXXVI.
6162,CLXXVI.,
6163,CLXXVI.,Upon the blue Symplegades:  long years--
6164,CLXXVI.,"Long, though not very many--since have done"
6165,CLXXVI.,Their work on both; some suffering and some tears
6166,CLXXVI.,Have left us nearly where we had begun:
6167,CLXXVI.,"Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run,"
6168,CLXXVI.,We have had our reward--and it is here;
6169,CLXXVI.,"That we can yet feel gladdened by the sun,"
6170,CLXXVI.,"And reap from earth, sea, joy almost as dear"
6171,CLXXVI.,As if there were no man to trouble what is clear.
6172,CLXXVI.,
6173,CLXXVII.,CLXXVII.
6174,CLXXVII.,
6175,CLXXVII.,"Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,"
6176,CLXXVII.,"With one fair Spirit for my minister,"
6177,CLXXVII.,"That I might all forget the human race,"
6178,CLXXVII.,"And, hating no one, love but only her!"
6179,CLXXVII.,Ye Elements!--in whose ennobling stir
6180,CLXXVII.,I feel myself exalted--can ye not
6181,CLXXVII.,Accord me such a being?  Do I err
6182,CLXXVII.,In deeming such inhabit many a spot?
6183,CLXXVII.,Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.

6190,CLXXVIII.,"By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:"
6191,CLXXVIII.,"I love not Man the less, but Nature more,"
6192,CLXXVIII.,"From these our interviews, in which I steal"
6193,CLXXVIII.,"From all I may be, or have been before,"

6200,CLXXIX.,Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
6201,CLXXIX.,Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
6202,CLXXIX.,Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
6203,CLXXIX.,"The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain"
6204,CLXXIX.,"A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,"
6205,CLXXIX.,"When for a moment, like a drop of rain,"

6214,CLXXX.,"For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,"
6215,CLXXX.,"Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,"
6216,CLXXX.,"And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray"
6217,CLXXX.,"And howling, to his gods, where haply lies"
6218,CLXXX.,"His petty hope in some near port or bay,"
6219,CLXXX.,And dashest him again to earth:--there let him lay.

6238,CLXXXII.,And many a tyrant since:  their shores obey
6239,CLXXXII.,"The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay"
6240,CLXXXII.,"Has dried up realms to deserts:  not so thou,"
6241,CLXXXII.,Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play--
6242,CLXXXII.,Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow--
6243,CLXXXII.,"Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now."

6250,CLXXXIII.,"Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime"
6251,CLXXXIII.,"Dark-heaving;--boundless, endless, and sublime--"
6252,CLXXXIII.,The image of Eternity--the throne
6253,CLXXXIII.,Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
6254,CLXXXIII.,The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
6255,CLXXXIII.,"Obeys thee:  thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone."

6259,CLXXXIV.,"And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy"
6260,CLXXXIV.,Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
6261,CLXXXIV.,"Borne like thy bubbles, onward:  from a boy"
6262,CLXXXIV.,I wantoned with thy breakers--they to me
6263,CLXXXIV.,Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
6264,CLXXXIV.,"Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,"
6265,CLXXXIV.,"For I was as it were a child of thee,"
6266,CLXXXIV.,"And trusted to thy billows far and near,"
6267,CLXXXIV.,And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.

6271,CLXXXV.,My task is done--my song hath ceased--my theme

6273,CLXXXV.,The spell should break of this protracted dream.
6274,CLXXXV.,The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit
6275,CLXXXV.,"My midnight lamp--and what is writ, is writ--"
6276,CLXXXV.,Would it were worthier! but I am not now
6277,CLXXXV.,That which I have been--and my visions flit
