29,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
30,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
31,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Grimmer walks upon the floor,"
32,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Well can Grimmer wield his sword:
33,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Give to me fair Ingeborg,"
34,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,For the sake of Christ our Lord.”
35,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
36,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Far too little art thou, lad,"
37,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Thou about thee canst not hack;
38,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"When thou comest ’mong other kemps,"
39,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Ever do they drive thee back.”
40,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
41,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Not so little, Sire, am I,"
42,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,I myself full well can guard;
43,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,When I fight with kempions I
44,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Gallantly can ply my sword.”
45,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
46,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Kamper dwells in Birting’s land,"
47,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,For a stalwart kemp he’s known;
48,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Thou shalt wed my daughter, if"
49,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Thou to earth canst hew him down.”
50,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
51,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Rage and grief his bosom filled,"
52,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Grimmer through the door retires:
53,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,“What answer did my father give?”
54,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Beauteous Ingeborg inquires.
55,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
56,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Kamper dwells in Birting’s land,"
57,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,And he bears a warlike name;
58,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"If I him to death can smite,"
59,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,I may thee with honour claim.”
60,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
61,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Answered him the fair young maid:
62,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Ah! my father seeks thy death,"
63,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Kamper for thee is far too strong,"
64,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,He will work thee rueful scathe.
65,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
66,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“But I’ll lend a helm to thee,"
67,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Thou may’st trust upon in fight;
68,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"And an acton I’ll provide,"
69,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Whereupon no sword will bite.
70,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
71,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“I’ll give thee a faulchion good,"
72,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,And a harness on to put;
73,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,On earth’s ground no sword is found
74,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Through that harness which can cut.
75,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
76,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,“I will give to thee a sword
77,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,In thy youthful hand to bear;
78,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Thou therewith mayst iron cleave,"
79,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,E’en as though it water were.”
80,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
81,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Kamper stands on Birtingsborough,"
82,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Thence so far he sees and wide:
83,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,“What can be that little wreck
84,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Hitherward that seems to glide?”
85,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
86,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,It was little Grimmer bold
87,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Steered his vessel straight to land;
88,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,’Twas the bulky Kamper then
89,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Tow’rds him stretched a friendly hand.
90,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
91,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Welcome, little Grimmer, be!"
92,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Here no harm thou hast to fear;
93,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Half my land I’ll give to thee,"
94,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,And my sister’s daughter dear.”
95,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
96,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Ne’er will I that Ingeborg,"
97,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"My beloved, should hear such shame,"
98,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"That I thy sister’s daughter took,"
99,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,And thy friend that I became.
100,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
101,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“But we’ll go to Vimming’s hill,"
102,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"And do battle, as is fit;"
103,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"One of us his life shall lose,"
104,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Ere the ring of death we quit.”
105,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
106,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Thereto answered Kamper bold,"
107,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,He had such an eager hand:
108,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“I’ll the first blow have, forsooth,"
109,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,’Tis on my own earth we stand.”
110,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
111,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"The first blow big Kamper struck,"
112,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Given ’twas with wrathful yell;
113,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"He so hard has Grimmer struck,"
114,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Down to earth young Grimmer fell.
115,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
116,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Upstood little Grimmer then
117,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Quickly little Grimmer rose:
118,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Thou shalt also stand me one,"
119,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Ere the sun sinks to repose.”
120,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
121,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"The next blow was Glimmer’s own,"
122,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Fierce he hewed with his right hand;
123,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"He hewed on Kamper’s golden helm,"
124,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,To his heart down went the brand.
125,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
126,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Kamper bellowed as he fell,"
127,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Dead upon the earth so hard:
128,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,“Would to God that of my case
129,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Knew my brother Rodengard!”
130,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
131,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Joyous little Grimmer was,"
132,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,That the fight to end had come;
133,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Gold and silver much he took,"
134,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,To the maid he bore it home.
135,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
136,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Blood forth streaming from his wound
137,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Lies the mighty Kamper dead;
138,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Grimmer lives, the brave young swain,"
139,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Carries off his gold so red.
140,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
141,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"When he had the victory won,"
142,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Little space he tarried there;
143,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Joyous sailed his men away,"
144,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Joyous with their booty fair.
145,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
146,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Standing on the battlement,"
147,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Looks the Damsel towards the strand:
148,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"“Yonder I my youth espy,"
149,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,See his vessel touch the strand.”
150,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
151,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"Thanks to brave young Grimmer be,"
152,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,For his faith he kept so well;
153,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,"On next Monday morn, at dawn,"
154,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,Grimmer’s bridal feast befell.
155,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,

158,GRIMMER AND KAMPER,
159,MIMMERING TAN,MIMMERING TAN
160,MIMMERING TAN,
161,MIMMERING TAN,
162,MIMMERING TAN,The smallest man was Mimmering
163,MIMMERING TAN,E’er born in the land of Carl the King.
164,MIMMERING TAN,
165,MIMMERING TAN,And ere he into the world was brought
166,MIMMERING TAN,His clothes already were for him wrought.
167,MIMMERING TAN,
168,MIMMERING TAN,"Ere yet he could walk across the floor,"
169,MIMMERING TAN,A ponderous iron cuirass he bore.
170,MIMMERING TAN,
171,MIMMERING TAN,"And ere he had learnt to ride, to ride,"
172,MIMMERING TAN,His father’s sword to his hip he tied.
173,MIMMERING TAN,
174,MIMMERING TAN,The first time he his sword could bear
175,MIMMERING TAN,A better knight breathed not the air.
176,MIMMERING TAN,
177,MIMMERING TAN,"So down he went to the salt sea strand,"
178,MIMMERING TAN,As the merchants lay before the land.
179,MIMMERING TAN,
180,MIMMERING TAN,"He saw then, under the steep hill’s side,"
181,MIMMERING TAN,A knight with sheeny armour ride.
182,MIMMERING TAN,
183,MIMMERING TAN,"Coursing came he at headlong speed,"
184,MIMMERING TAN,Grim as a lion was his steed.
185,MIMMERING TAN,
186,MIMMERING TAN,"“Now, gallant Sir Knight, to me attend,"
187,MIMMERING TAN,Wilt let me with thee as a shield boy wend?”
188,MIMMERING TAN,
189,MIMMERING TAN,"“Thou art too little and young, I fear,"
190,MIMMERING TAN,My heavy harness thou canst not bear.”
191,MIMMERING TAN,
192,MIMMERING TAN,"At that word Mimmering wrathful grew,"
193,MIMMERING TAN,The Knight from his steed to earth he threw.
194,MIMMERING TAN,
195,MIMMERING TAN,"And much more harm to him was done,"
196,MIMMERING TAN,He smote his head against a stone.
197,MIMMERING TAN,
198,MIMMERING TAN,"He clomb on the saddle and rode away,"
199,MIMMERING TAN,He’ll fain with other knights have a fray.
200,MIMMERING TAN,
201,MIMMERING TAN,"And when to the green wood he had won,"
202,MIMMERING TAN,There met he Vidrik Verlandson.
203,MIMMERING TAN,
204,MIMMERING TAN,"“Well met, well met, thou stalwart knight,"
205,MIMMERING TAN,"Say, wilt thou for a fair maid fight?”"
206,MIMMERING TAN,
207,MIMMERING TAN,Then straightway Vidrik made reply:
208,MIMMERING TAN,"“I’ll meet thee, dwarf, or no man am I.”"
209,MIMMERING TAN,
210,MIMMERING TAN,"They fought for a day, they fought for twain,"
211,MIMMERING TAN,Neither could from the other the victory gain.
212,MIMMERING TAN,
213,MIMMERING TAN,"So good stall-brothership vowed have they,"
214,MIMMERING TAN,Which should endure to the judgment day.
215,MIMMERING TAN,
216,MIMMERING TAN,How should it endure that long time all?
217,MIMMERING TAN,It could not last till evening-fall.
218,MIMMERING TAN,

222,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE
223,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
224,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
225,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Young Sivard he his step-sire slew
226,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,To avenge his mother’s wrongs;
227,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And now to sport in the Monarch’s court
228,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Young Sivard sorely longs.
229,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
230,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,It was Sivard Snarenswayne
231,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,To his mother’s presence strode:
232,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“Say, shall I ride from hence?” he cried,"
233,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,“Or wend on foot my road?”
234,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
235,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,“O never shalt thou go on foot
236,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Whilst I’ve a horse in stall;
237,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"I’ll give thee the steed of matchless breed,"
238,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Which courtiers Grayman call.”
239,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
240,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"They led Grayman out of the stall,"
241,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,His reins were gilt about;
242,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"His eyes were bright as the clear star-light,"
243,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And fire from his bit sprang out.
244,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
245,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"Off Sivard throws his gloves, like snows"
246,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,The stripling’s hands appeared;
247,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"And with all his force he girded the horse,"
248,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,For to trust the groom he feared.
249,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
250,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"It was Sivard’s mother dear,"
251,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,In a kirtle red was clad:
252,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“The horse I fear will cost thee dear,"
253,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And that fear makes me sad.”
254,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
255,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"She followed him a long, long way,"
256,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Her heart was filled with woe:
257,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“O take good heed of the Grayman steed,"
258,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,He many a trick doth know!”
259,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
260,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“Now list to me, my mother dear,"
261,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Quick cast your care aside;
262,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"To a son of worth thou hast given birth,"
263,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Who his horse full well can ride.”
264,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
265,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"Away they go, o’er bridges now,"
266,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And now o’er brooks in flood;
267,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Clung so tight to his steed the knight
268,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,That his boots were filled with blood.
269,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
270,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"The horse he hurried o’er the wold,"
271,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Right past the crowded Ting;
272,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"Then wildly gazed the folk, amazed"
273,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,That the horse he could so spring.
274,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
275,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,For fifteen nights and for fifteen days
276,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,The speed of their race endured;
277,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Before them tall uprose a hall
278,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,With the gates all fast secured.
279,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
280,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"The Dane King stood on the battlement,"
281,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And thence looked far and wide:
282,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“Some drunken peer is coming here,"
283,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Who his horse full well can ride.
284,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
285,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“O that is either a drunken peer,"
286,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,On courser good and keen;
287,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"Or that, I swear, is my sister’s heir,"
288,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And in battle he has been.”
289,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
290,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"The horse did spit from his mouth the bit,"
291,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"And, neighing, bounded high;"
292,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Then maids and dames forsook their games
293,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And trembled fearfully.
294,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
295,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"Then maids and dames forsook their games,"
296,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And shook their weeds below;
297,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"To meet the boy, his sister’s joy,"
298,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,The King of the Danes did go.
299,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
300,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"It was the mighty King of the Danes,"
301,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And thus the King he cried:
302,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"“Ye archers, straight undo the gate,"
303,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And fling it open wide.”
304,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
305,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"It was Sivard Snarenswayne,"
306,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Through the portal in rode he;
307,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Then dames fifteen of beauteous mien
308,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Before him bent their knee.
309,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
310,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,The Dane King to his merry men spake:
311,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,“I rede ye treat him fair;
312,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,I tell to ye for a verity
313,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,No jesting he will bear.”
314,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
315,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"It was Sivard Snarenswayne,"
316,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,He made his courser bound
317,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"Ten ells and more the ramparts o’er,"
318,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,And thus his death he found.
319,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
320,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,"From his gilded selle down Sivard fell,"
321,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Snapped Grayman’s back outright;
322,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,Wept great and small in the Monarch’s hall
323,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,For the wizard steed and knight.
324,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
325,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,
326,THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE,

329,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
330,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
331,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Count Sir Guncelin,"
332,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Who to his mother cried:
333,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,“O I in quest of knightly fame
334,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Through foreign lands will ride.”
335,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
336,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“And if thou from the land wilt ride,"
337,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"To help thee on thy way,"
338,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"I give thee the steed, the wondrous steed,"
339,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,The good steed Carl the grey.
340,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
341,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“I’ll give the steed for thy time of need,"
342,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The good grey Carl, but know"
343,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"No spur of steel must grace thy heel,"
344,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Nor helm be on thy brow.
345,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
346,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Never a warrior must thou heed,"
347,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"But straight thy path pursue,"
348,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Till thou in fight engage the knight
349,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Whose name is Ivor Blue.”
350,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
351,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Count Sir Guncelin,"
352,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,By the green hill took his way;
353,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"There chanced he to meet little Tilventin,"
354,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And bade him promptly stay.
355,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
356,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Now welcome little Tilventin,"
357,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And where hast thou passed the night?”
358,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“I have passed the night at Brattingsborg,"
359,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Where from helms the fire they smite!”
360,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
361,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Count Sir Guncelin,"
362,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,From under his red helm glared:
363,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,“Sir Tilventin it had better been
364,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,If that thou hadst never declared.”
365,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
366,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Count Sir Guncelin,"
367,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,His sharp sword out he drew;
368,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was little Tilventin,"
369,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Whom he did to pieces hew.
370,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
371,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"He rode away unto Brattingsborg,"
372,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,On the door he struck with his spear:
373,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Doth any warrior bide therein,"
374,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Who will come and fight me here?”
375,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
376,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Knight Sir Ivor Blue,"
377,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,He turned to the West his eye:
378,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Now help me Wolf and Asmer hawk,"
379,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,I hear a kemp’s fierce cry.”
380,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
381,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Knight Sir Ivor Blue,"
382,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,He turned to the East his eye:
383,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Now help me, Odin, for thou hast might,"
384,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,I hear Sir Guncelin’s cry!”
385,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
386,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"It was the Count Sir Guncelin,"
387,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,His helm o’er his white neck flung;
388,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,That sound in the ear of his mother dear
389,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Through the dark night-time rung.
390,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
391,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The Dame awoke at black midnight,"
392,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And unto her Lord she cried:
393,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Now deign, now deign, thou highest God,"
394,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,With my son in this fray to bide!”
395,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
396,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The first course that together they rode,"
397,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"So strong were the knightly twain,"
398,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Struck Guncelin Sir Ivor Blue,"
399,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And stretched him on the plain.
400,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
401,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Now listen, Count Sir Guncelin,"
402,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"If thou’lt but let me live,"
403,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"My young and newly wedded bride,"
404,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,I unto thee will give.”
405,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
406,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,“I will not take thy wedded bride
407,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Upon marriage stands my mind;
408,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Give me Salentia, sister thine,"
409,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And my fate to her’s I’ll bind.”
410,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
411,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They rode away to the bridal feast,"
412,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Withouten more ado;
413,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Of stalwart knights, and warrior wights,"
414,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,They invited the best they knew.
415,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
416,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They invited Vidrik Verlandson,"
417,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And Diderik, knight of Bern;"
418,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They invited Olger the Daneman too,"
419,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Who in battle is so stern.
420,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
421,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They invited Silvard Snarenswayne,"
422,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Who before the bride should ride;
423,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And thither came also Langben the Jutt,"
424,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,To sit at the Bridegroom’s side.
425,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
426,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They invited Master Hildebrand,"
427,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,The bridal torch he carried;
428,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And he was followed by Kempions twelve,"
429,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Deep drank they whilst they tarried,"
430,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
431,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And thither came Folker Spilleman,"
432,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,With his humour the kemps must bear;
433,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And thither came King Sigfrid Hoon,"
434,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,To his own pain and care.
435,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
436,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Then came the proud Dame Grimhild,"
437,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,To prepare the bride for the hall;
438,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"With iron she caused her feet to be shod,"
439,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And her fingers with steel tipped all.
440,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
441,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And thither came Dame Gunda Hetta,"
442,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,’Mid the Norland hills her house;
443,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And there doth she pass a right merry life,"
444,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,With dance and with carouse.
445,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
446,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Thither came likewise Dame Brynhild,"
447,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"She cut for the bride the meat,"
448,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Her followed slender ladies seven,"
449,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,’Midst the knights they took their seat.
450,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
451,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,They follow’d the bride to the chamber in.
452,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Of a luncheon slight to taste;
453,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And there she eat four tuns of pottage,"
454,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Which pleased her palate best.
455,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
456,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Then before her sixteen oxen-bodies,"
457,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And eighteen swine disappear;
458,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And before her thirst she could assuage,"
459,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,She drank seven tuns of beer.
460,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
461,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"So mighty the press of their garments was,"
462,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"As they led the bride to the hall,"
463,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"That they brushed down, ere they ushered her in,"
464,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Full fifteen ells from the wall.
465,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
466,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They led the bride to the bride-bench up,"
467,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"And sat themselves down so light,"
468,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"That a bench of stone which they sat upon,"
469,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Sank into the ground outright.
470,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
471,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"They placed before her the very best food,"
472,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Nor did she the food decline;
473,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Fifteen oxen the sea-wife ate,"
474,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And also ten fat swine.
475,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
476,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The bridegroom’s eyes were upon her fixed,"
477,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And at length surprised he grew:
478,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Ne’er have I seen a youthful bride,"
479,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,To the dish such justice do.”
480,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
481,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Up then sprang the Kempions all,"
482,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And to one another did say:
483,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"“Now, whether shall we cast the bar,"
484,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Or fight in knightly way?”
485,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
486,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The warriors began to describe the round,"
487,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Upon the verdant earth;
488,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"For the honour and pride of the young sea-bride,"
489,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Who should look on their deeds of worth.
490,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
491,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The young bride up from the bride-bench sprang,"
492,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Two hands so weak had she;
493,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Towards her Langben the Giant leapt,"
494,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Fine sport began to be.
495,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
496,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Then danced the table, then danced the bench,"
497,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,And the sparks from the helms flew high;
498,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Out ran the valiant warriors all:
499,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,“Dame Devil thou mak’st us fly!”
500,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
501,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"Then there arose a mightier dance,"
502,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,From Ribe unto the Slee;
503,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,The shortest warrior dancing had
504,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Fifteen ells beneath the knee.
505,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,
506,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,"The shortest warrior in that dance,"
507,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,Was little Mimmering Tan;
508,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,He was among that heathenish throng
509,SIR GUNCELIN’S WEDDING,The only Christian man.
