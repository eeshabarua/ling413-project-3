57,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,The Romantic poets rediscovered a pastoral and Biblical dream: that a
58,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,child was the most innocent and the wisest of us all. Wordsworth
59,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"hailed him as ""Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!"" And in the next generation"
60,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,Victorian novelists took that dream seriously enough to make children
61,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,the heroes and heroines of their most searching fictions. There had
62,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"been no ""children's literature"" to speak of before, except for the"
63,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"oral and ""popular"" tradition, including lullabies and _Mother Goose_,"
64,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,some of which go back as far as Tudor and even medieval times.
65,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,
66,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,Children's literature today is an immense and complex domain; and
67,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,leaving aside for the present the works composed by children
68,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"themselves, what remains varies tremendously in skill and delight, as"
69,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,well as in subtlety and intention. So I shall also set aside those
70,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"minimal ""vocabulary-building"" tales and verses whose small virtues are"
71,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"rarely more than therapeutic, and direct myself only to that"
72,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,specialized but most important category--poems written by a skilled
73,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,and adult poet but addressed to an audience of children who are likely
74,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,to be read to until they are skillful enough to read the same verses
75,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,for themselves.
76,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,
77,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,The dangers for the poet in addressing so composite an audience are
78,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"enormous: cuteness, coyness, archness and condescension are only the"
79,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,most obvious ones. Some great writers of children's verse--Lewis
80,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,Carroll and Edward Lear--have successfully hedged themselves against
81,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"these dangers by insistent comedy and parody (Carroll's ""serious"""
82,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,children's verse is maudlin and embarrassing). By this means they have
83,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"contrived what the child will take as lovely, unintimidating,"
84,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"mysterious, rational nonsense, and what the adult will recognize as a"
85,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"travesty or burlesque of something very edgy indeed. Thus, Lear's ""The"
86,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"Dong with the Luminous Nose"" and Carroll's ""Jabberwocky"" are,"
87,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"respectively, bright and disguised versions of gothic terror and"
88,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"misery on the one hand, and medieval knightly exploit on the other,"
89,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,both rendered innocuous for the nursery and ridiculous for the adult.
90,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,The risks of seriousness have been successfully avoided.
91,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,
92,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,The poetry of Walter de la Mare sings boldly and beautifully without
93,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,any of these hedges and condescensions. His work has the honest candor
94,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,of the border ballads and the fairy tales: as well as unmitigated
95,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"joys, they are full of the dangers and horrors and sorrows that every"
96,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"child soon knows to be part of the world, however vainly parents try"
97,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,to veil them. A child's curiosity about the forbidden will insist on
98,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,being satisfied; and better by verse than otherwise. This poetry is
99,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,also musically astute and demanding; it may surprise and alert the
100,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"parental reader; and it has its share of archaisms and poeticisms,"
101,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"which, contrary to adult surmise, bemuse and fascinate children. And"
102,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"it must be admitted that it is also relentlessly British; but then, so"
103,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,is much good children's literature.

108,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"children""). His technical and linguistic skills are not, as Auden"
109,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"rightly points out, a matter of indifference to children, who are in"
110,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"the very business of learning language, as well as other facts of"
111,ISBN 0-8240-2310-2,"life, and who are particularly sensitive to verbal rhythms, as Iona"

924,THE PEDLAR,There came a Pedlar to an evening house;
925,THE PEDLAR,"Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,"
926,THE PEDLAR,"Wondered what man he was, so curious"
927,THE PEDLAR,His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:
928,THE PEDLAR,"Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--"
929,THE PEDLAR,"'What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,"
930,THE PEDLAR,"And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,"
931,THE PEDLAR,"Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,"
932,THE PEDLAR,To keep in water for to make night sweet:
933,THE PEDLAR,"All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!'"
934,THE PEDLAR,
935,THE PEDLAR,"Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her"
936,THE PEDLAR,The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:--
937,THE PEDLAR,"'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer"
938,THE PEDLAR,"Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys"
939,THE PEDLAR,And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;
940,THE PEDLAR,"Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,"
941,THE PEDLAR,Confuse his magic who is all mockery:
942,THE PEDLAR,"His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long"
943,THE PEDLAR,"But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,"
944,THE PEDLAR,And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!
945,THE PEDLAR,
946,THE PEDLAR,"'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,"
947,THE PEDLAR,"'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,"
948,THE PEDLAR,"One lock of hair is gold enough for me,"
949,THE PEDLAR,"For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'"
950,THE PEDLAR,"But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,"
951,THE PEDLAR,"'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'"
952,THE PEDLAR,And many another woodland tongue beside
953,THE PEDLAR,Rose softly in the silence--'Trust him not!'
954,THE PEDLAR,"Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,"
955,THE PEDLAR,"'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'"
956,THE PEDLAR,
957,THE PEDLAR,"A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,"
958,THE PEDLAR,"As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;"
959,THE PEDLAR,"Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--"
960,THE PEDLAR,"'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?"
961,THE PEDLAR,"Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,"
962,THE PEDLAR,"Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,"
963,THE PEDLAR,"A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,"
964,THE PEDLAR,"A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:"
965,THE PEDLAR,"Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,"
966,THE PEDLAR,'I pass not often such a lonely place.'
967,THE PEDLAR,
968,THE PEDLAR,"'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,"
969,THE PEDLAR,"'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,"
970,THE PEDLAR,Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:
971,THE PEDLAR,Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'
972,THE PEDLAR,There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;
973,THE PEDLAR,'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;
974,THE PEDLAR,"And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food"
975,THE PEDLAR,All day thy heart in happiness to keep';--
976,THE PEDLAR,"And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--"
977,THE PEDLAR,"'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'"
978,THE PEDLAR,
979,THE PEDLAR,O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!
980,THE PEDLAR,Now only night is where the Pedlar was;
981,THE PEDLAR,And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud
982,THE PEDLAR,"His magic steals in darkness, O alas!"

1023,THE OGRE,"'Tis moonlight on Trebarwith Vale,"
1024,THE OGRE,"And moonlight on an Ogre keen,"
1025,THE OGRE,Who prowling hungry through the dale
1026,THE OGRE,A lone cottage hath seen.
1027,THE OGRE,
1028,THE OGRE,Small with thin smoke ascending up
1029,THE OGRE,Three casements and a door:--
1030,THE OGRE,"The Ogre eager is to sup,"
1031,THE OGRE,And here seems dainty store.
1032,THE OGRE,
1033,THE OGRE,"Sweet as a larder to a mouse,"
1034,THE OGRE,"So to him staring down,"
1035,THE OGRE,"Seemed the sweet-windowed moonlit house,"
1036,THE OGRE,With jasmine overgrown.
1037,THE OGRE,
1038,THE OGRE,"He snorted, as the billows snort"
1039,THE OGRE,"In darkness of the night,"
1040,THE OGRE,"Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart,"
1041,THE OGRE,He glowered on the sight.
1042,THE OGRE,
1043,THE OGRE,Into the garden sweet with peas
1044,THE OGRE,"He put his wooden shoe,"
1045,THE OGRE,And bending back the apple trees
1046,THE OGRE,Crept covetously through;
1047,THE OGRE,
1048,THE OGRE,"Then, stooping, with an impious eye"
1049,THE OGRE,"Stared through the lattice small,"
1050,THE OGRE,And spied two children which did lie
1051,THE OGRE,"Asleep, against the wall."
1052,THE OGRE,
1053,THE OGRE,"Into their dreams no shadow fell,"
1054,THE OGRE,Of his disastrous thumb
1055,THE OGRE,"Groping discreet, and gradual,"
1056,THE OGRE,Across the quiet room.
1057,THE OGRE,
1058,THE OGRE,But scarce his nail had scraped the cot
1059,THE OGRE,"Wherein these children lay,"
1060,THE OGRE,"As if his malice were forgot,"
1061,THE OGRE,It suddenly did stay.
1062,THE OGRE,
1063,THE OGRE,For faintly in the ingle-nook
1064,THE OGRE,"He heard a cradlesong,"
1065,THE OGRE,That rose into his thoughts and woke
1066,THE OGRE,Terror them among.
1067,THE OGRE,
1068,THE OGRE,For she who in the kitchen sat
1069,THE OGRE,"Darning by the fire,"
1070,THE OGRE,"Guileless of what he would be at,"
1071,THE OGRE,Sang sweet as wind or wire:--
1072,THE OGRE,
1073,THE OGRE,"'Lullay, thou little tiny child,"
1074,THE OGRE,"By-by, lullay, lullie;"
1075,THE OGRE,"Jesu of glory, meek and mild,"
1076,THE OGRE,This night remember ye!
1077,THE OGRE,
1078,THE OGRE,"'Fiend, witch, and goblin, foul and wild,"
1079,THE OGRE,He deems 'em smoke to be;
1080,THE OGRE,"Lullay, thou little tiny child,"
1081,THE OGRE,"By-by, lullay, lullie!'"
1082,THE OGRE,
1083,THE OGRE,The Ogre lifted up his eyes
1084,THE OGRE,"Into the moon's pale ray,"
1085,THE OGRE,"And gazed upon her leopard-wise,"
1086,THE OGRE,Cruel and clear as day;
1087,THE OGRE,
1088,THE OGRE,He snarled in gluttony and fear:
1089,THE OGRE,"'The wind blows dismally,"
1090,THE OGRE,"Jesu in storm my lambs be near,"
1091,THE OGRE,"By-by, lullay, lullie!'"
1092,THE OGRE,
1093,THE OGRE,And like a ravenous beast which sees
1094,THE OGRE,"The hunter's icy eye,"
1095,THE OGRE,So did this wretch in wrath confess
1096,THE OGRE,Sweet Jesu's mastery.
1097,THE OGRE,
1098,THE OGRE,He lightly drew his greedy thumb
1099,THE OGRE,"From out that casement pale,"
1100,THE OGRE,"And strode, enormous, swiftly home,"
1101,THE OGRE,Whinnying down the dale.

1420,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"'A witch and witches, one and nine,' they straight to her reply,"
1421,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye."
1422,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,
1423,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,"
1424,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;

1427,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,
1428,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,"
1429,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;
1430,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,"
1431,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.

1433,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!"
1434,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'
1435,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,"
1436,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;"

1478,THE ENGLISHMAN,
1479,THE ENGLISHMAN,"'And oh!' says he, 'what leetle bird"
1480,THE ENGLISHMAN,"Is singing in yon high tree,"
1481,THE ENGLISHMAN,So every shrill and long-drawn note
1482,THE ENGLISHMAN,Like bubbles breaks in me?'
1483,THE ENGLISHMAN,

1487,THE ENGLISHMAN,When dawn comes up the sea.'
1488,THE ENGLISHMAN,
1489,THE ENGLISHMAN,"At which he fell a-musing,"
1490,THE ENGLISHMAN,"And fixed his eye on me,"

1493,THE ENGLISHMAN,

1555,THE PHANTOM,"'Go with this taper, bring it me;"
1556,THE PHANTOM,Carry it on your arm;

1559,THE PHANTOM,
1560,THE PHANTOM,"Late the hour, dark the night,"
1561,THE PHANTOM,"The house is solitary,"
1562,THE PHANTOM,Feeble is a taper's light
1563,THE PHANTOM,To light poor Ann to see.
1564,THE PHANTOM,
1565,THE PHANTOM,Her eyes are yet with visions bright
1566,THE PHANTOM,"Of sylph and river, flower and fay,"
1567,THE PHANTOM,Now through a narrow corridor
1568,THE PHANTOM,She takes her lonely way.

1570,THE PHANTOM,Vast shadows on the heedless walls
1571,THE PHANTOM,"Gigantic loom, stoop low:"

1579,THE PHANTOM,
1580,THE PHANTOM,Now in the dark clear glass she sees
1581,THE PHANTOM,"A taper mocking hers,--"
1582,THE PHANTOM,"A phantom face of light blue eyes,"
1583,THE PHANTOM,Reflecting phantom fears.
1584,THE PHANTOM,
1585,THE PHANTOM,"Around her loom the vacant rooms,"
1586,THE PHANTOM,"Wind the upward stairs,"
1587,THE PHANTOM,She climbs on into a loneliness
1588,THE PHANTOM,Only her taper shares.
1589,THE PHANTOM,
1590,THE PHANTOM,Her grandmother is deaf with age;
1591,THE PHANTOM,A garden of moonless trees
1592,THE PHANTOM,Would answer not though she should cry
1593,THE PHANTOM,In anguish on her knees.
1594,THE PHANTOM,
1595,THE PHANTOM,So that she scarcely heeds--so fast
1596,THE PHANTOM,Her pent-up heart doth beat--
1597,THE PHANTOM,"When, faint along the corridor,"
1598,THE PHANTOM,Falleth the sound of feet:--
1599,THE PHANTOM,
1600,THE PHANTOM,Sounds lighter than silk slippers make
1601,THE PHANTOM,"Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet"
1602,THE PHANTOM,Violin and 'cello wake
1603,THE PHANTOM,Music for twirling feet.
1604,THE PHANTOM,
1605,THE PHANTOM,"O! in an old unfriendly house,"
1606,THE PHANTOM,What shapes may not conceal
1607,THE PHANTOM,"Their faces in the open day,"
1608,THE PHANTOM,At night abroad to steal?
1609,THE PHANTOM,
1610,THE PHANTOM,Even her taper seems with fear
1611,THE PHANTOM,To languish small and blue;
1612,THE PHANTOM,Far in the woods the winter wind
1613,THE PHANTOM,Runs whistling through.
1614,THE PHANTOM,
1615,THE PHANTOM,"A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,"
1616,THE PHANTOM,"Her mouth is stretched to cry,"
1617,THE PHANTOM,"But sudden, with a gush of joy,"
1618,THE PHANTOM,It narrows to a sigh.
1619,THE PHANTOM,
1620,THE PHANTOM,It is a wilding child which comes
1621,THE PHANTOM,"Swift through the corridor,"
1622,THE PHANTOM,"Singing an old forgotten song,"
1623,THE PHANTOM,This ancient burden bore:--
1624,THE PHANTOM,
1625,THE PHANTOM,"'Thorn, thorn, I wis,"

1631,THE PHANTOM,"'Swim fish, sing bird,"
1632,THE PHANTOM,"And sigh again,"
1633,THE PHANTOM,"I that am lost am lone,"
1634,THE PHANTOM,Bee in the blossom never stirred
1635,THE PHANTOM,Locks hid beneath a stone!'--
1636,THE PHANTOM,
1637,THE PHANTOM,Her eye was of the azure fire
1638,THE PHANTOM,That hovers in wintry flame;
1639,THE PHANTOM,Her raiment wild and yellow as furze
1640,THE PHANTOM,That spouteth out the same;
1641,THE PHANTOM,
1642,THE PHANTOM,"And in her hand she bore no flower,"
1643,THE PHANTOM,But on her head a wreath
1644,THE PHANTOM,Of faded flag-flowers that did yet
1645,THE PHANTOM,Smell sweetly after death.
1646,THE PHANTOM,
1647,THE PHANTOM,Clear was the light of loveliness
1648,THE PHANTOM,That lit her face like rain;
1649,THE PHANTOM,And sad the mouth that uttered
1650,THE PHANTOM,Her immemorial strain.

1657,THE PHANTOM,No longer seems alone.
1658,THE PHANTOM,
1659,THE PHANTOM,"Fast though her taper dwindles down,"
1660,THE PHANTOM,"Heavy and thick the tome,"
1661,THE PHANTOM,A beauty beyond fear to dim
1662,THE PHANTOM,Haunts now her alien home.
1663,THE PHANTOM,
1664,THE PHANTOM,"Ghosts in the world malignant, grim,"
1665,THE PHANTOM,"Vex many a wood, and glen,"

1669,THE PHANTOM,But in her grannie's house this spirit--
1670,THE PHANTOM,A child as lone as she--
1671,THE PHANTOM,"Pining for love not found on earth,"
1672,THE PHANTOM,Ann dreams again to see.

2239,THE MOTHER BIRD,"And then she oped her dagger bill,--"
2240,THE MOTHER BIRD,"'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe"
2241,THE MOTHER BIRD,"At break of day; 'twas not a trill,"
2242,THE MOTHER BIRD,As falters through the quiet even;
2243,THE MOTHER BIRD,"But one sharp solitary note,"
2244,THE MOTHER BIRD,"One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry"
2245,THE MOTHER BIRD,"Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,"
2246,THE MOTHER BIRD,One passionate note of victory:
2247,THE MOTHER BIRD,"Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,"
2248,THE MOTHER BIRD,"Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,"
2249,THE MOTHER BIRD,At the mother bird in the secret hedge
2250,THE MOTHER BIRD,Patient upon her lonely nest.
