301,PREFACE,"In homely phrase, this is a sort of ""second helping"" of a dish that has"
302,PREFACE,pleased the taste of thousands. Our first collection of _Poems Teachers

304,PREFACE,"volume is the response to a demand for ""more."" In Book One it was"
305,PREFACE,impracticable to use all of the many poems entitled to inclusion on the
306,PREFACE,basis of their being desired. We are constantly in receipt of requests
307,PREFACE,that certain selections be printed in NORMAL INSTRUCTOR-PRIMARY PLANS on
308,PREFACE,"the page ""Poems Our Readers Have Asked For."" More than two hundred of"
309,PREFACE,"these were chosen for Book One, and more than two hundred others, as"
310,PREFACE,"much desired as those in the earlier volume, are included in Book Two."
311,PREFACE,
312,PREFACE,"Because of copyright restrictions, we often have been unable to present,"
313,PREFACE,"in magazine form, verse of large popular appeal. By special arrangement,"
314,PREFACE,a number of such poems were included in Book One of _Poems Teachers Ask

400,BOOK TWO,Afore it's home there's got t' be a heap o' livin' in it:
401,BOOK TWO,"Within the walls there's got t' be some babies born, and then"

431,BOOK TWO,The House with Nobody In It
432,BOOK TWO,
433,BOOK TWO,
434,BOOK TWO,Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track
435,BOOK TWO,I go by a poor old farm-house with its shingles broken and black;
436,BOOK TWO,"I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minute"
437,BOOK TWO,"And look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it."
438,BOOK TWO,
439,BOOK TWO,"I've never seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;"
440,BOOK TWO,"That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings."
441,BOOK TWO,"I know that house isn't haunted and I wish it were, I do,"
442,BOOK TWO,For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two.
443,BOOK TWO,
444,BOOK TWO,"This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,"
445,BOOK TWO,And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.
446,BOOK TWO,"It needs new paint and shingles and vines should be trimmed and tied,"
447,BOOK TWO,But what it needs most of all is some people living inside.
448,BOOK TWO,
449,BOOK TWO,"If I had a bit of money and all my debts were paid,"
450,BOOK TWO,I'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.
451,BOOK TWO,"I'd buy that place and fix it up the way that it used to be,"
452,BOOK TWO,And I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free.
453,BOOK TWO,
454,BOOK TWO,Now a new home standing empty with staring window and door
455,BOOK TWO,"Looks idle perhaps and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store,"
456,BOOK TWO,"But there's nothing mournful about it, it cannot be sad and lone"
457,BOOK TWO,For the lack of something within it that it has never known.
458,BOOK TWO,
459,BOOK TWO,"But a house that has done what a house should do, a house that has"
460,BOOK TWO,"sheltered life,"
461,BOOK TWO,"That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,"
462,BOOK TWO,"A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and helped up his stumbling feet,"
463,BOOK TWO,"Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet."
464,BOOK TWO,
465,BOOK TWO,So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track
466,BOOK TWO,"I never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,"
467,BOOK TWO,Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen
468,BOOK TWO,"apart,"
469,BOOK TWO,For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken
470,BOOK TWO,heart.

483,BOOK TWO,"With the subtle shadows, the change, the sheen,"
484,BOOK TWO,"That play in the golden hair of a girl,--"
485,BOOK TWO,A ripple of amber--a flare
486,BOOK TWO,Of light sweeping after--a curl
487,BOOK TWO,In the hollows like swirling feet
488,BOOK TWO,"Of fairy waltzers, the colors run"
489,BOOK TWO,To the western sun
490,BOOK TWO,Through the deeps of the ripening wheat.
491,BOOK TWO,
492,BOOK TWO,"Broad as the fleckless, soaring sky,"
493,BOOK TWO,"Mysterious, fair as the moon-led sea,"
494,BOOK TWO,The vast plain flames on the dazzled eye
495,BOOK TWO,Under the fierce sun's alchemy.
496,BOOK TWO,The slow hawk stoops
497,BOOK TWO,To his prey in the deeps;
498,BOOK TWO,The sunflower droops
499,BOOK TWO,To the lazy wave; the wind sleeps--
500,BOOK TWO,"Then swirling in dazzling links and loops,"
501,BOOK TWO,"A riot of shadow and shine,"
502,BOOK TWO,"A glory of olive and amber and wine,"
503,BOOK TWO,To the westering sun the colors run
504,BOOK TWO,Through the deeps of the ripening wheat.
505,BOOK TWO,
506,BOOK TWO,"O glorious land! My western land,"
507,BOOK TWO,Outspread beneath the setting sun!
508,BOOK TWO,"Once more amid your swells, I stand,"
509,BOOK TWO,And cross your sod-lands dry and dun.
510,BOOK TWO,I hear the jocund calls of men
511,BOOK TWO,Who sweep amid the ripened grain
512,BOOK TWO,"With swift, stern reapers; once again"
513,BOOK TWO,"The evening splendor floods the plain,"
514,BOOK TWO,The crickets' chime
515,BOOK TWO,"Makes pauseless rhyme,"
516,BOOK TWO,"And toward the sun,"
517,BOOK TWO,The colors run
518,BOOK TWO,Before the wind's feet
519,BOOK TWO,In the wheat!

532,BOOK TWO,A bird with a broken wing.
533,BOOK TWO,"I healed its wound, and each morning"
534,BOOK TWO,"It sang its old sweet strain,"
535,BOOK TWO,But the bird with a broken pinion
536,BOOK TWO,Never soared as high again.
537,BOOK TWO,
538,BOOK TWO,I found a young life broken
539,BOOK TWO,By sin's seductive art;
540,BOOK TWO,"And touched with a Christlike pity,"
541,BOOK TWO,I took him to my heart.
542,BOOK TWO,He lived with a noble purpose
543,BOOK TWO,And struggled not in vain;
544,BOOK TWO,But the life that sin had stricken
545,BOOK TWO,Never soared as high again.
546,BOOK TWO,
547,BOOK TWO,But the bird with a broken pinion
548,BOOK TWO,Kept another from the snare;
549,BOOK TWO,And the life that sin had stricken
550,BOOK TWO,Raised another from despair.
551,BOOK TWO,"Each loss has its compensation,"
552,BOOK TWO,There is healing for every pain;
553,BOOK TWO,But the bird with a broken pinion
554,BOOK TWO,Never soars as high again.

561,BOOK TWO,Jamie Douglas
562,BOOK TWO,
563,BOOK TWO,
564,BOOK TWO,It was in the days when Claverhouse
565,BOOK TWO,"Was scouring moor and glen,"
566,BOOK TWO,"To change, with fire and bloody sword,"
567,BOOK TWO,The faith of Scottish men.
568,BOOK TWO,
569,BOOK TWO,They had made a covenant with the Lord
570,BOOK TWO,"Firm in their faith to bide,"
571,BOOK TWO,"Nor break to Him their plighted word,"
572,BOOK TWO,Whatever might betide.
573,BOOK TWO,
574,BOOK TWO,"The sun was well-nigh setting,"
575,BOOK TWO,"When o'er the heather wild,"
576,BOOK TWO,"And up the narrow mountain-path,"
577,BOOK TWO,Alone there walked a child.
578,BOOK TWO,
579,BOOK TWO,"He was a bonny, blithesome lad,"
580,BOOK TWO,Sturdy and strong of limb--
581,BOOK TWO,"A father's pride, a mother's love,"
582,BOOK TWO,Were fast bound up in him.
583,BOOK TWO,
584,BOOK TWO,"His bright blue eyes glanced fearless round,"
585,BOOK TWO,His step was firm and light;
586,BOOK TWO,What was it underneath his plaid
587,BOOK TWO,His little hands grasped tight?
588,BOOK TWO,
589,BOOK TWO,"It was bannocks which, that very morn,"
590,BOOK TWO,His mother made with care.
591,BOOK TWO,From out her scanty store of meal;
592,BOOK TWO,"And now, with many a prayer,"
593,BOOK TWO,
594,BOOK TWO,"Had sent by Jamie her ane boy,"
595,BOOK TWO,"A trusty lad and brave,"
596,BOOK TWO,"To good old Pastor Tammons Roy,"
597,BOOK TWO,"Now hid in yonder cave,"
598,BOOK TWO,
599,BOOK TWO,And for whom the bloody Claverhouse
600,BOOK TWO,"Had hunted long in vain,"
601,BOOK TWO,And swore they would not leave that glen
602,BOOK TWO,Till old Tam Roy was slain.
603,BOOK TWO,
604,BOOK TWO,So Jamie Douglas went his way
605,BOOK TWO,With heart that knew no fear;
606,BOOK TWO,"He turned the great curve in the rock,"
607,BOOK TWO,Nor dreamed that death was near.
608,BOOK TWO,
609,BOOK TWO,"And there were bloody Claverhouse men,"
610,BOOK TWO,"Who laughed aloud with glee,"
611,BOOK TWO,"When trembling now within their power,"
612,BOOK TWO,The frightened child they see.
613,BOOK TWO,
614,BOOK TWO,"He turns to flee, but all in vain,"
615,BOOK TWO,They drag him back apace
616,BOOK TWO,"To where their cruel leader stands,"
617,BOOK TWO,And set them face to face.
618,BOOK TWO,
619,BOOK TWO,The cakes concealed beneath his plaid
620,BOOK TWO,Soon tell the story plain--
621,BOOK TWO,"""It is old Tam Roy the cakes are for,"""
622,BOOK TWO,Exclaimed the angry man.
623,BOOK TWO,
624,BOOK TWO,"""Now guide me to his hiding place"
625,BOOK TWO,"And I will let you go."""
626,BOOK TWO,"But Jamie shook his yellow curls,"
627,BOOK TWO,"And stoutly answered--""No!"""
628,BOOK TWO,
629,BOOK TWO,"""I'll drop you down the mountain-side,"
630,BOOK TWO,And there upon the stones
631,BOOK TWO,The old gaunt wolf and carrion crow
632,BOOK TWO,"Shall battle for your bones."""
633,BOOK TWO,
634,BOOK TWO,"And in his brawny, strong right hand"
635,BOOK TWO,"He lifted up the child,"
636,BOOK TWO,And held him where the clefted rocks
637,BOOK TWO,Formed a chasm deep and wild
638,BOOK TWO,
639,BOOK TWO,"So deep it was, the trees below"
640,BOOK TWO,Like stunted bushes seemed.
641,BOOK TWO,"Poor Jamie looked in frightened maze,"
642,BOOK TWO,It seemed some horrid dream.
643,BOOK TWO,
644,BOOK TWO,He looked up at the blue sky above
645,BOOK TWO,Then at the men near by;
646,BOOK TWO,"Had _they_ no little boys at home,"
647,BOOK TWO,That they could let him die?
648,BOOK TWO,
649,BOOK TWO,"But no one spoke and no one stirred,"
650,BOOK TWO,Or lifted hand to save
651,BOOK TWO,"From such a fearful, frightful death,"
652,BOOK TWO,The little lad so brave.
653,BOOK TWO,
654,BOOK TWO,"""It is woeful deep,"" he shuddering cried,"
655,BOOK TWO,"""But oh! I canna tell,"
656,BOOK TWO,"So drop me down then, if you will--"
657,BOOK TWO,"It is nae so deep as hell!"""
658,BOOK TWO,
659,BOOK TWO,"A childish scream, a faint, dull sound,"
660,BOOK TWO,"Oh! Jamie Douglas true,"
661,BOOK TWO,"Long, long within that lonely cave"
662,BOOK TWO,Shall Tam Roy wait for you.
663,BOOK TWO,
664,BOOK TWO,Long for your welcome coming
665,BOOK TWO,"Waits the mother on the moor,"
666,BOOK TWO,"And watches and calls, ""Come, Jamie, lad,"""
667,BOOK TWO,Through the half-open door.
668,BOOK TWO,
669,BOOK TWO,No more adown the rocky path
670,BOOK TWO,"You come with fearless tread,"
671,BOOK TWO,"Or, on moor or mountain, take"
672,BOOK TWO,The good man's daily bread.
673,BOOK TWO,
674,BOOK TWO,But up in heaven the shining ones
675,BOOK TWO,"A wondrous story tell,"
676,BOOK TWO,Of a child snatched up from a rocky gulf
677,BOOK TWO,That is nae so deep as hell.
678,BOOK TWO,
679,BOOK TWO,"And there before the great white throne,"
680,BOOK TWO,"Forever blessed and glad,"

682,BOOK TWO,Shall meet their bonny lad.

691,BOOK TWO,They are charging in the valley and you're needed with the rest.
692,BOOK TWO,"All the day long from its dawning till you saw your kinsman fall,"
693,BOOK TWO,You have answered fresh and fearless to our brave commander's call;
694,BOOK TWO,"And I would not rob my country of your gallant aid to-night,"
695,BOOK TWO,Though your presence and your pity stay my spirit in its flight.
696,BOOK TWO,
697,BOOK TWO,All along that quivering column see the death steed trampling down
698,BOOK TWO,Men whose deeds this day are worthy of a kingdom and a crown.
699,BOOK TWO,"Prithee hasten, Uncle Jared, what's the bullet in my breast"
700,BOOK TWO,To that murderous storm of fire raining tortures on the rest?
701,BOOK TWO,See! the bayonets flash and falter--look! the foe begins to win;
702,BOOK TWO,"See! oh, see our falling comrades! God! the ranks are closing in."
703,BOOK TWO,
704,BOOK TWO,"Hark! there's quickening in the distance and a thundering in the air,"
705,BOOK TWO,Like the roaring of a lion just emerging from his lair.
706,BOOK TWO,There's a cloud of something yonder fast unrolling like a scroll--
707,BOOK TWO,"Quick! oh, quick! if it be succor that can save the cause a soul!"
708,BOOK TWO,"Look! a thousand thirsty bayonets are flashing down the vale,"
709,BOOK TWO,And a thousand thirsty riders dashing onward like a gale!
710,BOOK TWO,
711,BOOK TWO,"Raise me higher, Uncle Jared, place the ensign in my hand!"
712,BOOK TWO,I am strong enough to float it while you cheer that flying band;
713,BOOK TWO,Louder! louder! shout for Freedom with prolonged and vigorous breath--
714,BOOK TWO,"Shout for Liberty and Union, and the victory over death!--"
715,BOOK TWO,See! they catch the stirring numbers and they swell them to the breeze--
716,BOOK TWO,Cap and plume and starry banner waving proudly through the trees.
717,BOOK TWO,
718,BOOK TWO,"Mark our fainting comrades rally, see that drooping column rise!"
719,BOOK TWO,I can almost see the fire newly kindled in their eyes.
720,BOOK TWO,"Fresh for conflict, nerved to conquer, see them charging on the foe--"
721,BOOK TWO,Face to face with deadly meaning--shot and shell and trusty blow.
722,BOOK TWO,See the thinned ranks wildly breaking--see them scatter to the sun--
723,BOOK TWO,"I can die, Uncle Jared, for the glorious day is won!"
724,BOOK TWO,
725,BOOK TWO,"But there's something, something pressing with a numbness on my heart,"
726,BOOK TWO,And my lips with mortal dumbness fail the burden to impart.
727,BOOK TWO,"Oh I tell you, Uncle Jared, there is something back of all"
728,BOOK TWO,That a soldier cannot part with when he heeds his country's call!
729,BOOK TWO,"Ask the mother what, in dying, sends her yearning spirit back"
730,BOOK TWO,"Over life's rough, broken marches, where she's pointed out the track."
731,BOOK TWO,
732,BOOK TWO,"Ask the dear ones gathered nightly round the shining household hearth,"
733,BOOK TWO,"What to them is dearer, better, than the brightest things of earth,"
734,BOOK TWO,"Ask that dearer one whose loving, like a ceaseless vestal flame,"
735,BOOK TWO,Sets my very soul a-glowing at the mention of her name;
736,BOOK TWO,Ask her why the loved in dying feels her spirit linked with his
737,BOOK TWO,"In a union death but strengthens, she will tell you what it is."
738,BOOK TWO,
739,BOOK TWO,"And there's something, Uncle Jared, you may tell her if you will--"
740,BOOK TWO,"That the precious flag she gave me, I have kept unsullied still."
741,BOOK TWO,And--this touch of pride forgive me--where death sought our gallant host--
742,BOOK TWO,"Where our stricken lines were weakest, there it ever waved the most."
743,BOOK TWO,"Bear it back and tell her fondly, brighter, purer, steadier far,"
744,BOOK TWO,"'Mid the crimson tide of battle, shone my life's fast setting star."
745,BOOK TWO,
746,BOOK TWO,"But forbear, dear Uncle Jared, when there's something more to tell,"
747,BOOK TWO,When her lips with rapid blanching bid you answer how I fell;
748,BOOK TWO,"Teach your tongue the trick of slighting, though 'tis faithful to the rest,"
749,BOOK TWO,Lest it say her brother's bullet is the bullet in my breast;
750,BOOK TWO,"But if it must be that she learn it despite your tenderest care,"
751,BOOK TWO,'Twill soothe her bleeding heart to know my bayonet pricked the air.

753,BOOK TWO,"Life is ebbing, Uncle Jared, my enlistment endeth here;"
754,BOOK TWO,"Death, the Conqueror, has drafted--I can no more volunteer,--"
755,BOOK TWO,But I hear the roll call yonder and I go with willing feet--
756,BOOK TWO,"Through the shadows of the valley where victorious armies meet,"
757,BOOK TWO,"Raise the ensign, Uncle Jared, let its dear folds o'er me fall--"

801,BOOK TWO,"Whence come those shrieks so wild and shrill,"
802,BOOK TWO,"That cut, like blades of steel, the air,"
803,BOOK TWO,Causing the creeping blood to chill
804,BOOK TWO,With the sharp cadence of despair?
805,BOOK TWO,
806,BOOK TWO,"Again they come, as if a heart"
807,BOOK TWO,"Were cleft in twain by one quick blow,"
808,BOOK TWO,And every string had voice apart
809,BOOK TWO,To utter its peculiar woe.
810,BOOK TWO,
811,BOOK TWO,"Whence came they? From yon temple, where"
812,BOOK TWO,"An altar, raised for private prayer,"
813,BOOK TWO,Now forms the warrior's marble bed
814,BOOK TWO,Who Warsaw's gallant armies led.
815,BOOK TWO,
816,BOOK TWO,The dim funereal tapers throw
817,BOOK TWO,"A holy luster o'er his brow,"
818,BOOK TWO,And burnish with their rays of light

820,BOOK TWO,Above the haughty brow and eye
821,BOOK TWO,Of a young boy that's kneeling by.
822,BOOK TWO,
823,BOOK TWO,"What hand is that, whose icy press"
824,BOOK TWO,"Clings to the dead with death's own grasp,"
825,BOOK TWO,But meets no answering caress?
826,BOOK TWO,No thrilling fingers seek its clasp.
827,BOOK TWO,It is the hand of her whose cry
828,BOOK TWO,"Rang wildly, late, upon the air,"
829,BOOK TWO,When the dead warrior met her eye
830,BOOK TWO,Outstretched upon the altar there.
831,BOOK TWO,
832,BOOK TWO,With pallid lip and stony brow
833,BOOK TWO,She murmurs forth her anguish now.
834,BOOK TWO,But hark! the tramp of heavy feet
835,BOOK TWO,Is heard along the bloody street;
836,BOOK TWO,"Nearer and nearer yet they come,"
837,BOOK TWO,With clanking arms and noiseless drum.
838,BOOK TWO,"Now whispered curses, low and deep,"
839,BOOK TWO,Around the holy temple creep;
840,BOOK TWO,The gate is burst; a ruffian band
841,BOOK TWO,"Rush in, and savagely demand,"
842,BOOK TWO,"With brutal voice and oath profane,"
843,BOOK TWO,The startled boy for exile's chain.
844,BOOK TWO,
845,BOOK TWO,"The mother sprang with gesture wild,"
846,BOOK TWO,And to her bosom clasped her child;
847,BOOK TWO,"Then, with pale cheek and flashing eye,"
848,BOOK TWO,"Shouted with fearful energy,"
849,BOOK TWO,"""Back, ruffians, back! nor dare to tread"
850,BOOK TWO,Too near the body of my dead;
851,BOOK TWO,Nor touch the living boy; I stand
852,BOOK TWO,Between him and your lawless band.
853,BOOK TWO,"Take _me_, and bind these arms--these hands,--"
854,BOOK TWO,"With Russia's heaviest iron bands,"
855,BOOK TWO,And drag me to Siberia's wild
856,BOOK TWO,"To perish, if 'twill save my child!"""
857,BOOK TWO,
858,BOOK TWO,"""Peace, woman, peace!"" the leader cried,"
859,BOOK TWO,"Tearing the pale boy from her side,"
860,BOOK TWO,And in his ruffian grasp he bore
861,BOOK TWO,His victim to the temple door.
862,BOOK TWO,"""One moment!"" shrieked the mother; ""one!"
863,BOOK TWO,Will land or gold redeem my son?
864,BOOK TWO,"Take heritage, take name, take all,"
865,BOOK TWO,But leave him free from Russian thrall!
866,BOOK TWO,"Take these!"" and her white arms and hands"
867,BOOK TWO,"She stripped of rings and diamond bands,"
868,BOOK TWO,And tore from braids of long black hair
869,BOOK TWO,The gems that gleamed like starlight there;
870,BOOK TWO,"Her cross of blazing rubies, last,"
871,BOOK TWO,Down at the Russian's feet she cast.
872,BOOK TWO,He stooped to seize the glittering store;--
873,BOOK TWO,"Up springing from the marble floor,"
874,BOOK TWO,"The mother, with a cry of joy,"
875,BOOK TWO,Snatched to her leaping heart the boy.
876,BOOK TWO,But no! the Russian's iron grasp
877,BOOK TWO,Again undid the mother's clasp.
878,BOOK TWO,"Forward she fell, with one long cry"
879,BOOK TWO,Of more than mortal agony.
880,BOOK TWO,
881,BOOK TWO,"But the brave child is roused at length,"
882,BOOK TWO,"And, breaking from the Russian's hold,"
883,BOOK TWO,"He stands, a giant in the strength"
884,BOOK TWO,"Of his young spirit, fierce and bold."
885,BOOK TWO,"Proudly he towers; his flashing eye,"
886,BOOK TWO,"So blue, and yet so bright,"
887,BOOK TWO,"Seems kindled from the eternal sky,"
888,BOOK TWO,So brilliant is its light.
889,BOOK TWO,
890,BOOK TWO,His curling lips and crimson cheeks
891,BOOK TWO,Foretell the thought before he speaks;
892,BOOK TWO,With a full voice of proud command
893,BOOK TWO,He turned upon the wondering band.
894,BOOK TWO,
895,BOOK TWO,"""Ye hold me not! no! no, nor can;"
896,BOOK TWO,This hour has made the boy a man.
897,BOOK TWO,"I knelt before my slaughtered sire,"
898,BOOK TWO,Nor felt one throb of vengeful ire.
899,BOOK TWO,"I wept upon his marble brow,"
900,BOOK TWO,"Yes, wept! I was a child; but now"
901,BOOK TWO,"My noble mother, on her knee,"
902,BOOK TWO,"Hath done the work of years for me!"""
903,BOOK TWO,
904,BOOK TWO,"He drew aside his broidered vest,"
905,BOOK TWO,"And there, like slumbering serpent's crest,"
906,BOOK TWO,The jeweled haft of poniard bright
907,BOOK TWO,Glittered a moment on the sight.
908,BOOK TWO,"""Ha! start ye back? Fool! coward! knave!"
909,BOOK TWO,Think ye my noble father's glaive
910,BOOK TWO,Would drink the life-blood of a slave?
911,BOOK TWO,The pearls that on the handle flame
912,BOOK TWO,Would blush to rubies in their shame;
913,BOOK TWO,The blade would quiver in thy breast
914,BOOK TWO,Ashamed of such ignoble rest.
915,BOOK TWO,"No! thus I rend the tyrant's chain,"
916,BOOK TWO,"And fling him back a boy's disdain!"""
917,BOOK TWO,
918,BOOK TWO,"A moment, and the funeral light"
919,BOOK TWO,Flashed on the jeweled weapon bright;
920,BOOK TWO,"Another, and his young heart's blood"
921,BOOK TWO,"Leaped to the floor, a crimson flood."
922,BOOK TWO,"Quick to his mother's side he sprang,"
923,BOOK TWO,And on the air his clear voice rang:
924,BOOK TWO,"""Up, mother, up! I'm free! I'm free!"
925,BOOK TWO,The choice was death or slavery.
926,BOOK TWO,"Up, mother, up! Look on thy son!"
927,BOOK TWO,His freedom is forever won;
928,BOOK TWO,And now he waits one holy kiss
929,BOOK TWO,To bear his father home in bliss;
930,BOOK TWO,"One last embrace, one blessing,--one!"
931,BOOK TWO,"To prove thou knowest, approvest thy son."
932,BOOK TWO,What! silent yet? Canst thou not feel
933,BOOK TWO,My warm blood o'er thy heart congeal?

1271,BOOK TWO,"No feuds of faith, no spleen of race,"
1272,BOOK TWO,No darkly brooding fear should try
1273,BOOK TWO,Beneath our flag to find a place.
1274,BOOK TWO,Lo! every people here has sent
1275,BOOK TWO,"Its sons to answer freedom's call,"
1276,BOOK TWO,Their lifeblood is the strong cement
1277,BOOK TWO,That builds and binds the nation's wall.

1302,BOOK TWO,"Trouble In the ""Amen Corner"""
1303,BOOK TWO,
1304,BOOK TWO,
1305,BOOK TWO,"'Twas a stylish congregation, that of Theophrastus Brown,"
1306,BOOK TWO,"And its organ was the finest and the biggest in the town,"
1307,BOOK TWO,"And the chorus--all the papers favorably commented on it,"
1308,BOOK TWO,For 'twas said each female member had a forty-dollar bonnet.
1309,BOOK TWO,
1310,BOOK TWO,"Now in the ""amen corner"" of the church sat Brother Eyer,"
1311,BOOK TWO,Who persisted every Sabbath-day in singing with the choir;
1312,BOOK TWO,"He was poor but genteel-looking, and his heart as snow was white,"
1313,BOOK TWO,And his old face beamed with sweetness when he sang with all his might.
1314,BOOK TWO,
1315,BOOK TWO,"His voice was cracked and broken, age had touched his vocal chords,"
1316,BOOK TWO,And nearly every Sunday he would mispronounce the words
1317,BOOK TWO,"Of the hymns, and 'twas no wonder, he was old and nearly blind,"
1318,BOOK TWO,And the choir rattling onward always left him far behind.
1319,BOOK TWO,
1320,BOOK TWO,"The chorus stormed and blustered, Brother Eyer sang too slow,"
1321,BOOK TWO,And then he used the tunes in vogue a hundred years ago;
1322,BOOK TWO,"At last the storm-cloud burst, and the  church was told, in fine,"
1323,BOOK TWO,"That the brother must stop singing, or the choir would resign."
1324,BOOK TWO,
1325,BOOK TWO,Then the pastor called together in the vestry-room one day
1326,BOOK TWO,"Seven influential members who subscribe more than they pay,"
1327,BOOK TWO,"And having asked God's guidance in a printed pray'r or two,"
1328,BOOK TWO,They put their heads together to determine what to do.
1329,BOOK TWO,
1330,BOOK TWO,"They debated, thought, suggested, till at last ""dear Brother York,"""
1331,BOOK TWO,"Who last winter made a million on a sudden rise in pork,"
1332,BOOK TWO,"Rose and moved that a committee wait at once on Brother Eyer,"
1333,BOOK TWO,"And proceed to rake him lively ""for disturbin' of the choir."""
1334,BOOK TWO,
1335,BOOK TWO,"Said he: ""In that 'ere organ I've invested quite a pile,"
1336,BOOK TWO,And we'll sell it if we cannot worship in the latest style;
1337,BOOK TWO,Our Philadelphy tenor tells me 'tis the hardest thing
1338,BOOK TWO,Fer to make God understand him when the brother tries to sing.
1339,BOOK TWO,
1340,BOOK TWO,"""We've got the biggest organ, the best-dressed choir in town,"
1341,BOOK TWO,"We pay the steepest sal'ry to our pastor, Brother Brown;"
1342,BOOK TWO,But if we must humor ignorance because it's blind and old--
1343,BOOK TWO,"If the choir's to be pestered, I will seek another fold."""
1344,BOOK TWO,
1345,BOOK TWO,"Of course the motion carried, and one day a coach and four,"
1346,BOOK TWO,"With the latest style of driver, rattled up to Eyer's door;"
1347,BOOK TWO,"And the sleek, well-dress'd committee, Brothers Sharkey, York and Lamb,"
1348,BOOK TWO,As they crossed the humble portal took good care to miss the jamb.
1349,BOOK TWO,
1350,BOOK TWO,"They found the choir's great trouble sitting in his old arm chair,"
1351,BOOK TWO,And the Summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his thin white hair;
1352,BOOK TWO,"He was singing ""Rock of Ages"" in a cracked voice and low"
1353,BOOK TWO,"But the angels understood him, 'twas all he cared to know."
1354,BOOK TWO,
1355,BOOK TWO,"Said York: ""We're here, dear brother, with the vestry's approbation"
1356,BOOK TWO,"To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation"";"
1357,BOOK TWO,"""And the choir, too,"" said Sharkey, giving Brother York a nudge,"
1358,BOOK TWO,"""And the choir, too!"" he echoed with the graveness of a judge."
1359,BOOK TWO,
1360,BOOK TWO,"""It was the understanding when we bargained for the chorus"
1361,BOOK TWO,"That it was to relieve us, that is, do the singing for us;"
1362,BOOK TWO,"If we rupture the agreement, it is very plain, dear brother,"
1363,BOOK TWO,It will leave our congregation and be gobbled by another.
1364,BOOK TWO,
1365,BOOK TWO,"""We don't want any singing except that what we've bought!"
1366,BOOK TWO,The latest tunes are all the rage; the old ones stand for naught;
1367,BOOK TWO,"And so we have decided--are you list'ning, Brother Eyer?--"
1368,BOOK TWO,"That you'll have to stop your singin' for it flurrytates the choir."""
1369,BOOK TWO,
1370,BOOK TWO,"The old man slowly raised his head, a sign that he did hear,"
1371,BOOK TWO,And on his cheek the trio caught the glitter of a tear;
1372,BOOK TWO,"His feeble hands pushed back the locks white as the silky snow,"
1373,BOOK TWO,As he answered the committee in a voice both sweet and low:
1374,BOOK TWO,
1375,BOOK TWO,"""I've sung the psalms of David nearly eighty years,"" said he;"
1376,BOOK TWO,"""They've been my staff and comfort all along life's dreary way;"
1377,BOOK TWO,"I'm sorry I disturb the choir, perhaps I'm doing wrong;"
1378,BOOK TWO,"But when my heart is filled with praise, I can't keep back a song."
1379,BOOK TWO,
1380,BOOK TWO,"""I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet,"
1381,BOOK TWO,"In the far-off heav'nly temple, where the Master I shall greet--"
1382,BOOK TWO,"Yes, I wonder when I try to sing the songs of God up high'r,"
1383,BOOK TWO,"If the angel band will church me for disturbing heaven's choir."""
1384,BOOK TWO,
1385,BOOK TWO,A silence filled the little room; the old man bowed his head;
1386,BOOK TWO,"The carriage rattled on again, but Brother Eyer was dead!"
1387,BOOK TWO,"Yes, dead! his hand had raised the veil the future hangs before us,"
1388,BOOK TWO,And the Master dear had called him to the everlasting chorus.
1389,BOOK TWO,
1390,BOOK TWO,"The choir missed him for a while, but he was soon forgot,"
1391,BOOK TWO,A few church-goers watched the door; the old man entered not.
1392,BOOK TWO,"Far away, his voice no longer cracked, he sang his heart's desires,"
1393,BOOK TWO,Where there are no church committees and no fashionable choirs!

2114,BOOK TWO,
2115,BOOK TWO,"They sat in the yellow sunlight,"
2116,BOOK TWO,Out under the maple-tree;
2117,BOOK TWO,"And the game that they played I'll tell you,"

2122,BOOK TWO,"With an old, old, old, old lady,"
2123,BOOK TWO,And a boy with a twisted knee.
2124,BOOK TWO,
2125,BOOK TWO,The boy would bend his face down
2126,BOOK TWO,"On his one little sound right knee,"
2127,BOOK TWO,"And he'd guess where she was hiding,"
2128,BOOK TWO,"In guesses One, Two, Three!"
2129,BOOK TWO,
2130,BOOK TWO,"""You are in the china-closet!"""
2131,BOOK TWO,"He would cry, and laugh with glee--"
2132,BOOK TWO,It wasn't the china-closet;
2133,BOOK TWO,But he still had Two and Three.
2134,BOOK TWO,
2135,BOOK TWO,"""You are up in Papa's big bedroom,"

2143,BOOK TWO,And he found her with his Three.
2144,BOOK TWO,
2145,BOOK TWO,"Then she covered her face with her fingers,"
2146,BOOK TWO,"That were wrinkled and white and wee,"
2147,BOOK TWO,"And she guessed where the boy was hiding,"
2148,BOOK TWO,With a One and a Two and a Three.
2149,BOOK TWO,
2150,BOOK TWO,"And they never had stirred from their places,"
2151,BOOK TWO,Right under the maple-tree--

2204,BOOK TWO,And the cripple went away;
2205,BOOK TWO,And the day wore onward swiftly--
2206,BOOK TWO,"And my task was nearly done,"
2207,BOOK TWO,And a prayer was ever in my heart
2208,BOOK TWO,That the Master to me might come.
2209,BOOK TWO,
2210,BOOK TWO,"And I thought I would spring to meet Him,"

3044,BOOK TWO,
3045,BOOK TWO,We all look on with anxious eyes
3046,BOOK TWO,"When Father carves the duck,"
3047,BOOK TWO,And Mother almost always sighs
3048,BOOK TWO,When Father carves the duck;
3049,BOOK TWO,Then all of us prepare to rise
3050,BOOK TWO,"And hold our bibs before our eyes,"
3051,BOOK TWO,And be prepared for some surprise
3052,BOOK TWO,When Father carves the duck.
3053,BOOK TWO,
3054,BOOK TWO,"He braces up and grabs the fork,"
3055,BOOK TWO,"Whene'er he carves the duck,"
3056,BOOK TWO,And won't allow a soul to talk
3057,BOOK TWO,Until he carves the duck.
3058,BOOK TWO,"The fork is jabbed into the sides,"
3059,BOOK TWO,"Across the breast the knife he slides,"
3060,BOOK TWO,While every careful person hides
3061,BOOK TWO,From flying chips of duck.
3062,BOOK TWO,
3063,BOOK TWO,The platter's always sure to slip
3064,BOOK TWO,"When Father carves the duck,"
3065,BOOK TWO,And how it makes the dishes skip--
3066,BOOK TWO,Potatoes fly amuck.
3067,BOOK TWO,"The squash and cabbage leap in space,"
3068,BOOK TWO,"We get some gravy in our face,"
3069,BOOK TWO,And Father mutters Hindoo grace
3070,BOOK TWO,Whene'er he carves a duck.
3071,BOOK TWO,
3072,BOOK TWO,We then have learned to walk around
3073,BOOK TWO,The dining room and pluck
3074,BOOK TWO,From off the window-sills and walls
3075,BOOK TWO,Our share of Father's duck.
3076,BOOK TWO,"While Father growls and blows and jaws,"
3077,BOOK TWO,"And swears the knife was full of flaws,"

3107,BOOK TWO,"Form of childish, witching grace."
3108,BOOK TWO,
3109,BOOK TWO,"But the eager face was clouded,"

3111,BOOK TWO,"Till I said, ""I'll make a letter"
3112,BOOK TWO,"Of you, darling boy, instead."""
3113,BOOK TWO,
3114,BOOK TWO,So I parted back the tresses
3115,BOOK TWO,"From his forehead high and white,"
3116,BOOK TWO,And a stamp in sport I pasted
3117,BOOK TWO,'Mid its waves of golden light.
3118,BOOK TWO,
3119,BOOK TWO,"Then I said, ""Now, little letter,"
3120,BOOK TWO,"Go away and bear good news."""
3121,BOOK TWO,And I smiled as down the staircase

3123,BOOK TWO,
3124,BOOK TWO,"Leaving me, the darling hurried"
3125,BOOK TWO,"Down to Mary in his glee,"

3131,BOOK TWO,"Reached his little cap and tippet,"
3132,BOOK TWO,Standing on the entry stair.
3133,BOOK TWO,
3134,BOOK TWO,"No one heard the front door open,"

3157,BOOK TWO,By the busy crowd swept on.
3158,BOOK TWO,
3159,BOOK TWO,"Suddenly the crowd was parted,"
3160,BOOK TWO,"People fled to left and right,"
3161,BOOK TWO,As a pair of maddened horses
3162,BOOK TWO,At the moment dashed in sight.
3163,BOOK TWO,
3164,BOOK TWO,No one saw the baby figure--
3165,BOOK TWO,"No one saw the golden hair,"
3166,BOOK TWO,Till a voice of frightened sweetness

3168,BOOK TWO,
3169,BOOK TWO,'Twas too late--a moment only

3173,BOOK TWO,
3174,BOOK TWO,"Reverently they raised my darling,"
3175,BOOK TWO,"Brushed away the curls of gold,"
3176,BOOK TWO,"Saw the stamp upon the forehead,"
3177,BOOK TWO,Growing now so icy cold.
3178,BOOK TWO,
3179,BOOK TWO,"Not a mark the face disfigured,"

3276,BOOK TWO,"Nothin' too big, an' nothin' too nice,"
3277,BOOK TWO,Nothin' she wouldn't sacrifice
3278,BOOK TWO,For one she loved; an' that 'ere one
3279,BOOK TWO,"Was herself, when all was said an' done;"
3280,BOOK TWO,"An' Charley an' 'Becca meant well, no doubt,"

3282,BOOK TWO,"An' all o' our folks ranked well, you see,"

3284,BOOK TWO,"An' when, one dark an' rainy night,"
3285,BOOK TWO,"A neighbor's horse went out o' sight,"
3286,BOOK TWO,"They hitched on me, as the guilty chap"
3287,BOOK TWO,That carried one end o' the halter-strap.
3288,BOOK TWO,"An' I think, myself, that view of the case"
3289,BOOK TWO,Wasn't altogether out o' place;
3290,BOOK TWO,"My mother denied it, as mothers do,"
3291,BOOK TWO,But I am inclined to believe 'twas true.
3292,BOOK TWO,Though for me one thing might be said--
3293,BOOK TWO,"That I, as well as the horse, was led;"
3294,BOOK TWO,"And the worst of whisky spurred me on,"
3295,BOOK TWO,Or else the deed would have never been done.
3296,BOOK TWO,But the keenest grief I ever felt
3297,BOOK TWO,"Was when my mother beside me knelt,"
3298,BOOK TWO,"An' cried, an' prayed, till I melted down,"
3299,BOOK TWO,As I wouldn't for half the horses in town.
3300,BOOK TWO,"I kissed her fondly, then an' there,"
3301,BOOK TWO,An' swore henceforth to be honest and square.
3302,BOOK TWO,
3303,BOOK TWO,I served my sentence--a bitter pill
3304,BOOK TWO,Some fellows should take who never will;
3305,BOOK TWO,"And then I decided to go ""out West,"""
3306,BOOK TWO,Concludin' 'twould suit my health the best;

3311,BOOK TWO,"An', better than that, I was steady an' true,"
3312,BOOK TWO,An' put my good resolutions through.
3313,BOOK TWO,"But I wrote to a trusty old neighbor, an' said,"
3314,BOOK TWO,"""You tell 'em, old fellow, that I am dead,"

3321,BOOK TWO,An' started for her that very day.
3322,BOOK TWO,"And when I arrived where I was grown,"
3323,BOOK TWO,I took good care that I shouldn't be known;
3324,BOOK TWO,"But I bought the old cottage, through and through,"
3325,BOOK TWO,Of someone Charley had sold it to;
3326,BOOK TWO,And held back neither work nor gold
3327,BOOK TWO,To fix it up as it was of old.
3328,BOOK TWO,"The same big fire-place, wide and high,"
3329,BOOK TWO,Flung up its cinders toward the sky;
3330,BOOK TWO,The old clock ticked on the corner-shelf--
3331,BOOK TWO,I wound it an' set it a-goin' myself;
3332,BOOK TWO,"An' if everything wasn't just the same,"
3333,BOOK TWO,Neither I nor money was to blame;
3334,BOOK TWO,_Then--over the hill to the poor-house!_
3335,BOOK TWO,
3336,BOOK TWO,"One blowin', blusterin' winter's day,"
3337,BOOK TWO,With a team an' cutter I started away;

3339,BOOK TWO,(They some'at resembled the horse I stole;)
3340,BOOK TWO,"I hitched, an' entered the poor-house door--"
3341,BOOK TWO,A poor old woman was scrubbin' the floor;
3342,BOOK TWO,"She rose to her feet in great surprise,"
3343,BOOK TWO,"And looked, quite startled, into my eyes;"

3345,BOOK TWO,In the lines that marred her dear old face;
3346,BOOK TWO,"""Mother!"" I shouted, ""your sorrows is done!"

3349,BOOK TWO,
3350,BOOK TWO,"She didn't faint; she knelt by my side,"
3351,BOOK TWO,"An' thanked the Lord, till I fairly cried."
3352,BOOK TWO,"An' maybe our ride wasn't pleasant an' gay,"
3353,BOOK TWO,An' maybe she wasn't wrapped up that day;
3354,BOOK TWO,"An' maybe our cottage wasn't warm an' bright,"
3355,BOOK TWO,"An' maybe it wasn't a pleasant sight,"
3356,BOOK TWO,"To see her a-gettin' the evenin's tea,"
3357,BOOK TWO,An' frequently stoppin' an' kissin' me;

3658,BOOK TWO,
3659,BOOK TWO,
3660,BOOK TWO,"Like a dream, it all comes o'er me as I hear the Christmas bells;"
3661,BOOK TWO,"Like a dream it floats before me, while the Christmas anthem swells;"
3662,BOOK TWO,"Like a dream it bears me onward in the silent, mystic flow,"
3663,BOOK TWO,To a dear old sunny Christmas in the happy long ago.
3664,BOOK TWO,
3665,BOOK TWO,"And my thoughts go backward, backward, and the years that intervene"
3666,BOOK TWO,Are but as the mists and shadows when the sunlight comes between;
3667,BOOK TWO,"And all earthly wealth and splendor seem but as a fleeting show,"
3668,BOOK TWO,As there comes to me the picture of a Christmas long ago.
3669,BOOK TWO,
3670,BOOK TWO,"I can see the great, wide hearthstone and the holly hung about;"
3671,BOOK TWO,"I can see the smiling faces, I can hear the children shout;"
3672,BOOK TWO,"I can feel the joy and gladness that the old room seem to fill,"
3673,BOOK TWO,E'en the shadows on the ceiling--I can see them dancing still.
3674,BOOK TWO,
3675,BOOK TWO,I can see the little stockings hung about the chimney yet;
3676,BOOK TWO,I can feel my young heart thrilling lest the old man should forget.
3677,BOOK TWO,"Ah! that fancy! Were the world mine, I would give it, if I might,"
3678,BOOK TWO,"To believe in old St. Nicholas, and be a child to-night."
3679,BOOK TWO,
3680,BOOK TWO,"Just to hang my little stocking where it used to hang, and feel"
3681,BOOK TWO,For one moment all the old thoughts and the old hopes o'er me steal.
3682,BOOK TWO,"But, oh! loved and loving faces, in the firelight's dancing glow,"
3683,BOOK TWO,There will never come another like that Christmas long ago!
3684,BOOK TWO,
3685,BOOK TWO,"For the old home is deserted, and the ashes long have lain"
3686,BOOK TWO,"In the great, old-fashioned fireplace that will never shine again."
3687,BOOK TWO,Friendly hands that then clasped ours now are folded 'neath the snow;
3688,BOOK TWO,Gone the dear ones who were with us on that Christmas long ago.
3689,BOOK TWO,
3690,BOOK TWO,Let the children have their Christmas--let them have it while they may;
3691,BOOK TWO,"Life is short and childhood's fleeting, and there'll surely come a day"

3693,BOOK TWO,Missing all the merry faces that had greeted him of yore;
3694,BOOK TWO,
3695,BOOK TWO,"When no childish step shall echo through the quiet, silent room;"
3696,BOOK TWO,"When no childish smile shall brighten, and no laughter lift the gloom;"
3697,BOOK TWO,When the shadows that fall 'round us in the fire-light's fitful glow

3710,BOOK TWO,
3711,BOOK TWO,Nearer my Father's house

3715,BOOK TWO,
3716,BOOK TWO,Nearer the bound of life
3717,BOOK TWO,Where we lay our burdens down;
3718,BOOK TWO,"Nearer leaving the cross,"
3719,BOOK TWO,Nearer gaining the crown.
3720,BOOK TWO,
3721,BOOK TWO,"But lying darkly between,"
3722,BOOK TWO,"Winding down through the night,"
3723,BOOK TWO,Is the dim and unknown stream
3724,BOOK TWO,That leads at last to the light.
3725,BOOK TWO,
3726,BOOK TWO,Closer and closer my steps
3727,BOOK TWO,Come to the dark abysm;
3728,BOOK TWO,Closer death to my lips
3729,BOOK TWO,Presses the awful chrism.
3730,BOOK TWO,
3731,BOOK TWO,"Father, perfect my trust;"
3732,BOOK TWO,Strengthen the might of my faith;
3733,BOOK TWO,Let me feel as I would when I stand
3734,BOOK TWO,"On the rock of the shore of death,--"
3735,BOOK TWO,
3736,BOOK TWO,Feel as I would when my feet
3737,BOOK TWO,Are slipping o'er the brink;

3739,BOOK TWO,Nearer now than I think.

3763,BOOK TWO,Always knitting grandpa's stocking--

3769,BOOK TWO,
3770,BOOK TWO,"Grandma says our modern jumping,"
3771,BOOK TWO,"Rushing, whirling, dashing, bumping,"
3772,BOOK TWO,Would have shocked the gentle people long ago.
3773,BOOK TWO,"No, they moved with stately grace,"
3774,BOOK TWO,"Everything in proper place,"
3775,BOOK TWO,"Gliding slowly forward, then"
3776,BOOK TWO,Slowly courtesying back again.
3777,BOOK TWO,
3778,BOOK TWO,"Modern ways are quite alarming, grandma says,"

4520,BOOK TWO,

4522,BOOK TWO,Without thee what were life?
4523,BOOK TWO,One bliss I cannot leave behind:
4524,BOOK TWO,I'll take--my--precious--wife!
4525,BOOK TWO,
4526,BOOK TWO,The angel took a sapphire pen
4527,BOOK TWO,"And wrote in rainbow dew,"
4528,BOOK TWO,"""The man would be a boy again,"
4529,BOOK TWO,"And be a husband, too!"""
4530,BOOK TWO,
4531,BOOK TWO,"""And is there nothing yet unsaid"
4532,BOOK TWO,Before the change appears?
4533,BOOK TWO,"Remember, all their gifts have fled"
4534,BOOK TWO,"With those dissolving years!"""
4535,BOOK TWO,
4536,BOOK TWO,"""Why, yes; for memory would recall"
4537,BOOK TWO,My fond paternal joys;
4538,BOOK TWO,I could not bear to leave them all:
4539,BOOK TWO,"I'll take--my--girl--and--boys!"""
4540,BOOK TWO,
4541,BOOK TWO,The smiling angel dropped his pen--
4542,BOOK TWO,"""Why, this will never do;"
4543,BOOK TWO,"The man would be a boy again,"
4544,BOOK TWO,"And be a father too!"""
4545,BOOK TWO,
4546,BOOK TWO,And so I laughed--my laughter woke
4547,BOOK TWO,The household with its noise--
4548,BOOK TWO,"And wrote my dream, when morning broke,"
4549,BOOK TWO,To please the gray-haired boys.

4774,BOOK TWO,It was the twilight hour;
4775,BOOK TWO,"Behind the western hill the sun had sunk,"
4776,BOOK TWO,Leaving the evening sky aglow with crimson light.
4777,BOOK TWO,The air is filled with fragrance and with sound;
4778,BOOK TWO,"High in the tops of shadowy vine-wreathed trees,"
4779,BOOK TWO,"Grave parent-birds were twittering good-night songs,"
4780,BOOK TWO,To still their restless brood.
4781,BOOK TWO,Across the way
4782,BOOK TWO,A noisy little brook made pleasant
4783,BOOK TWO,"Music on the summer air,"
4784,BOOK TWO,"And farther on, the sweet, faint sound"
4785,BOOK TWO,"Of Whippoorwill Falls rose on the air, and fell"
4786,BOOK TWO,Like some sweet chant at vespers.

4789,BOOK TWO,And from the beds of flowers the tall
4790,BOOK TWO,"White lilies point like angel fingers upward,"
4791,BOOK TWO,"Casting on the air an incense sweet,"
4792,BOOK TWO,"That brings to mind the old, old story"
4793,BOOK TWO,Of the alabaster box that loving Mary
4794,BOOK TWO,Broke upon the Master's feet.
4795,BOOK TWO,
4796,BOOK TWO,Upon his vine-wreathed porch
4797,BOOK TWO,An old white-headed man sits dreaming
4798,BOOK TWO,"Happy, happy dreams of days that are no more;"
4799,BOOK TWO,And listening to the quaint old song
4800,BOOK TWO,With which his daughter lulled her child to rest:
4801,BOOK TWO,
4802,BOOK TWO,"""Abide with me,"" she says;"
4803,BOOK TWO,"""Fast falls the eventide;"
4804,BOOK TWO,"The darkness deepens,--"

4807,BOOK TWO,And as he listens to the sounds that fill the
4808,BOOK TWO,"Summer air, sweet, dreamy thoughts"
4809,BOOK TWO,"Of his ""lost youth"" come crowding thickly up;"
4810,BOOK TWO,"And, for a while, he seems a boy again."
4811,BOOK TWO,With feet all bare
4812,BOOK TWO,"He wades the rippling brook, and with a boyish shout"
4813,BOOK TWO,"Gathers the violets blue, and nodding ferns,"

4844,BOOK TWO,"Pointed up the way her Christ had gone,"
4845,BOOK TWO,"God called the wife and mother home,"
4846,BOOK TWO,And bade him wait.
4847,BOOK TWO,Oh! why is it so hard for
4848,BOOK TWO,"Man to wait? to sit with folded hands,"
4849,BOOK TWO,"Apart, amid the busy throng,"
4850,BOOK TWO,And hear the buzz and hum of toil around;
4851,BOOK TWO,To see men reap and bind the golden sheaves
4852,BOOK TWO,"Of earthly fruits, while he looks idly on,"
4853,BOOK TWO,"And knows he may not join,"
4854,BOOK TWO,"But only wait till God has said, ""Enough!"""
4855,BOOK TWO,And calls him home!
4856,BOOK TWO,
4857,BOOK TWO,"And thus the old man dreams,"
4858,BOOK TWO,And then awakes; awakes to hear
4859,BOOK TWO,The sweet old song just dying
4860,BOOK TWO,On the pulsing evening air:
4861,BOOK TWO,
4862,BOOK TWO,"""When other helpers fail,"
4863,BOOK TWO,"And comforts flee,"
4864,BOOK TWO,"Lord of the helpless,"
4865,BOOK TWO,"Oh, abide with me!"""

4912,BOOK TWO,"""White sand, white sand,"" he softly cries,"

4926,BOOK TWO,His little boat alone may float

4935,BOOK TWO,"Oh, he is very wise!"
4936,BOOK TWO,"But if, as he goes through the land,"

4948,BOOK TWO,"Lie softly down, dear little head,"
4949,BOOK TWO,"Rest quiet, busy hands,"
4950,BOOK TWO,"Till by your bed when good-night's said,"

5427,I,
5428,I,"The district school-master was sitting behind his great book-laden desk,"
5429,I,"Close-watching the motions of scholars, pathetic and gay and grotesque."
5430,I,"As whisper the half-leafless branches, when autumn's brisk breezes have"
5431,I,"come,"
5432,I,His little scrub-thicket of pupils sent upward a half-smothered hum.
5433,I,"There was little Tom Timms on the front seat, whose face was withstanding"
5434,I,a drouth.
5435,I,"And jolly Jack Gibbs just behind him, with a rainy new moon for a mouth;"
5436,I,"There were both of the Smith boys, as studious as if they bore names that"
5437,I,"could bloom,"
5438,I,"And Jim Jones, a heaven-built mechanic, the slyest young knave in the room,"
5439,I,"With a countenance grave as a horse's, and his honest eyes fixed on a pin,"
5440,I,Queer-bent on a deeply-laid project to tunnel Joe Hawkins's skin.
5441,I,"There were anxious young novices, drilling their spelling-books into their"
5442,I,"brain,"
5443,I,"Loud-puffing each half-whispered letter, like an engine just starting its"
5444,I,train;
5445,I,"There was one fiercely muscular fellow, who scowled at the sums on his"
5446,I,"slate,"
5447,I,And leered at the innocent figures a look of unspeakable hate;
5448,I,"And set his white teeth close together, and gave his thin lips a short"
5449,I,"twist,"
5450,I,"As to say, ""I could whip you, confound you! could such things be done with"
5451,I,"the fist!"""
5452,I,"There were two knowing girls in the corner, each one with some beauty"
5453,I,"possessed,"
5454,I,In a whisper discussing the problem which one the young master likes best;
5455,I,"A class in the front, with their readers, were telling, with difficult"
5456,I,"pains,"
5457,I,How perished brave Marco Bozzaris while bleeding at all of his veins;
5458,I,"And a boy on the floor to be punished, a statue of idleness stood,"

5466,II,"A patch of thick plaster, just over the school-master's rickety chair,"
5467,II,"Seemed threat'ningly o'er him suspended, like Damocles' sword, by a hair."
5468,II,There were tracks on the desks where the knife-blades had wandered in
5469,II,search of their prey;
5470,II,Their tops were as duskily spattered as if they drank ink every day.
5471,II,"The square stove it puffed and it crackled, and broke out in red flaming"
5472,II,"sores,"
5473,II,Till the great iron quadruped trembled like a dog fierce to rush
5474,II,out-o'-doors.
5475,II,White snowflakes looked in at the windows; the gale pressed its lips to the
5476,II,cracks;

5485,III,at the door;
5486,III,"And five of the good district fathers marched into the room in a row,"
5487,III,"And stood themselves up by the fire, and shook off their white cloaks of"
5488,III,snow.
5489,III,"And the spokesman, a grave squire of sixty, with countenance solemnly sad,"
5490,III,"Spoke thus, while the children all listened, with all of the ears that"
5491,III,they had:
5492,III,"""We've come here, school-master, in-tendin' to cast an inquirin' eye"
5493,III,"'round,"
5494,III,"Concernin' complaints that's been entered, an' fault that has lately been"
5495,III,found;
5496,III,"To pace off the width of your doin's, an' witness what you've been about,"
5497,III,"An' see if it's paying to keep you, or whether we'd best turn ye out."
5498,III,
5499,III,"""The first thing I'm bid for to mention is, when the class gets up to read"
5500,III,"You give 'em too tight of a reinin', an' touch 'em up more than they need;"
5501,III,"You're nicer than wise in the matter of holdin' the book in one han',"
5502,III,"An' you turn a stray _g_ in their _doin's_, an' tack an odd _d_"
5503,III,on their _an'_;
5504,III,"There ain't no great good comes of speakin' the words so polite, as I see,"
5505,III,"Providin' you know what the facts is, an' tell 'em off jest as they be."
5506,III,"An' then there's that readin' in corncert, is censured from first unto"
5507,III,last;
5508,III,"It kicks up a heap of a racket, when folks is a-travelin' past."
5509,III,"Whatever is done as to readin', providin' things go to my say,"
5510,III,"Shan't hang on no new-fangled hinges, but swing in the old-fashioned way."""
5511,III,And the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
5512,III,"due,"
5513,III,"And nodded obliquely, and muttered: ""Them 'ere is my sentiments tew."""

5519,III,"An' when he spells out as he ought'r, you pass the word on to the next."
5520,III,They say there's some new-grafted books here that don't take them letters
5521,III,along;
5522,III,"But if it is so, just depend on 't, them new-grafted books is made wrong."
5523,III,You might just as well say that Jackson didn't know all there was about

5525,III,As to say that old Spellin'-book Webster didn't know what them letters was
5526,III,"for."""

5534,III,"With saw-bucks an' crosses and pothooks, an' _w's, x's, y's_ an' _z's_."

5544,III,But they come home from school t'other evenin' a-talking such stuff as this
5545,III,here:
5546,III,"'I love,' an' 'Thou lovest,' an' 'He loves,' an' 'We love,' an' 'You love,'"
5547,III,an' 'They--'
5548,III,An' they answered my questions: 'It's grammar'--'twas all I could get 'em
5549,III,to say.
5550,III,"Now if, 'stead of doin' your duty, you're carryin' matters on so"

5563,IV,"The soot flew in clouds all about him, and blotted with black all the place"

5566,IV,"The school, ever sharp for amusement, laid down all their cumbersome books"

5716,IV,"As we heard him sing, while the gas burned low,"
5717,IV,_Non ti scordar di me?_[A]
5718,IV,
5719,IV,"The emperor there, in his box of state,"
5720,IV,"Looked grave, as if he had just then seen"
5721,IV,"The red flag wave from the city gate,"
5722,IV,Where his eagles in bronze had been.
5723,IV,
5724,IV,"The empress, too, had a tear in her eye,"
5725,IV,"You'd have said that her fancy had gone back again,"
5726,IV,"For one moment, under the old blue sky,"
5727,IV,To the old glad life in Spain.
5728,IV,
5729,IV,"Well, there in our front-row box we sat"
5730,IV,"Together, my bride betrothed and I;"
5731,IV,"My gaze was fixed on my opera hat,"
5732,IV,And hers on the stage hard by.
5733,IV,
5734,IV,"And both were silent, and both were sad."
5735,IV,"Like a queen she leaned on her full white arm,"
5736,IV,"With that regal, indolent air she had;"
5737,IV,So confident of her charm!
5738,IV,
5739,IV,I have not a doubt she was thinking then
5740,IV,"Of her former lord, good soul that he was!"
5741,IV,Who died the richest and roundest of men.
5742,IV,The Marquis of Carabas.
5743,IV,
5744,IV,"I hope that, to get to the kingdom of heaven,"
5745,IV,Through a needle's eye he had not to pass;
5746,IV,"I wish him well, for the jointure given"
5747,IV,To my Lady of Carabas.
5748,IV,
5749,IV,"Meanwhile, I was thinking of my first love,"
5750,IV,"As I had not been thinking of aught for years,"
5751,IV,Till over my eyes there began to move
5752,IV,Something that felt like tears.
5753,IV,
5754,IV,"I thought of the dress that she wore last time,"
5755,IV,"When we stood 'neath the cypress trees together,"
5756,IV,"In that lost land, in that soft clime,"
5757,IV,In the crimson evening weather:
5758,IV,
5759,IV,Of that muslin dress (for the eve was hot);
5760,IV,And her warm white neck in its golden chain;
5761,IV,"And her full soft hair, just tied in a knot,"
5762,IV,And falling loose again;
5763,IV,
5764,IV,And the jasmine flower in her fair young breast;
5765,IV,"(Oh, the faint, sweet smell of that jasmine flower!)"
5766,IV,And the one bird singing alone to his nest;
5767,IV,And the one star over the tower.
5768,IV,
5769,IV,"I thought of our little quarrels and strife,"
5770,IV,And the letter that brought me back my ring;
5771,IV,"And it all seemed then, in the waste of life,"
5772,IV,Such a very little thing!
5773,IV,
5774,IV,"For I thought of her grave below the hill,"
5775,IV,Which the sentinel cypress tree stands over;
5776,IV,"And I thought, ""Were she only living still,"
5777,IV,"How I could forgive her and love her!"""
5778,IV,
5779,IV,"And I swear, as I thought of her thus, in that hour,"
5780,IV,"And of how, after all, old things are best,"
5781,IV,That I smelt the smell of that jasmine flower
5782,IV,Which she used to wear in her breast.
5783,IV,
5784,IV,"It smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet,"
5785,IV,"It made me creep, and it made me cold;"
5786,IV,Like the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet
5787,IV,Where a mummy is half unrolled.
5788,IV,
5789,IV,"And I turned and looked: she was sitting there,"
5790,IV,"In a dim box over the stage, and drest"
5791,IV,"In that muslin dress, with that full, soft hair,"
5792,IV,And that jasmine in her breast!
5793,IV,
5794,IV,"I was here, and she was there;"
5795,IV,And the glittering horse-shoe curved between:--
5796,IV,"From my bride betrothed, with her raven hair,"
5797,IV,"And her sumptuous, scornful mien,"
5798,IV,
5799,IV,"To my early love, with her eyes downcast,"
5800,IV,"And over her primrose face the shade,"
5801,IV,"(In short, from the future back to the past,)"
5802,IV,There was but a step to be made.
5803,IV,
5804,IV,To my early love from my future bride
5805,IV,"One moment I looked. Then I stole to the door,"
5806,IV,I traversed the passage; and down at her side
5807,IV,"I was sitting, a moment more."
5808,IV,
5809,IV,"My thinking of her or the music's strain,"
5810,IV,"Or something which never will be exprest,"
5811,IV,"Had brought her back from the grave again,"
5812,IV,With the jasmine in her breast.
5813,IV,
5814,IV,"She is not dead, and she is not wed!"
5815,IV,"But she loves me now, and she loved me then!"
5816,IV,"And the very first word that her sweet lips said,"
5817,IV,My heart grew youthful again.
5818,IV,
5819,IV,"The marchioness there, of Carabas,"
5820,IV,"She is wealthy, and young, and handsome still;"
5821,IV,"And but for her--well, we'll let that pass;"
5822,IV,She may marry whomever she will.
5823,IV,
5824,IV,"But I will marry my own first love,"
5825,IV,"With her primrose face, for old things are best;"
5826,IV,"And the flower in her bosom, I prize it above"
5827,IV,The brooch in my lady's breast.
5828,IV,
5829,IV,"The world is filled with folly and sin,"
5830,IV,"And love must cling where it can, I say:"
5831,IV,For beauty is easy enough to win;
5832,IV,"But one isn't loved every day,"
5833,IV,
5834,IV,"And I think in the lives of most women and men,"
5835,IV,"There's a moment when all would go smooth and even,"
5836,IV,If only the dead could find out when
5837,IV,"To come back, and be forgiven."
5838,IV,
5839,IV,But oh the smell of that jasmine flower!
5840,IV,"And oh, that music! and oh, the way"
5841,IV,"That voice rang out from the donjon tower,"

5860,IV,
5861,IV,I love their grasses. The skies
5862,IV,"Are larger, and my restless eyes"
5863,IV,Fasten on more of earth and air
5864,IV,Than seashore furnishes anywhere.
5865,IV,
5866,IV,"I love the hazel thickets; and the breeze,"
5867,IV,The never resting prairie winds. The trees
5868,IV,That stand like spear points high
5869,IV,Against the dark blue sky
5870,IV,
5871,IV,Are wonderful to me. I love the gold
5872,IV,"Of newly shaven stubble, rolled"
5873,IV,"A royal carpet toward the sun, fit to be"
5874,IV,The pathway of a deity.
5875,IV,
5876,IV,I love the life of pasture lands; the songs of birds
5877,IV,Are not more thrilling to me than the herd's
5878,IV,Mad bellowing or the shadow stride
5879,IV,Of mounted herdsmen at my side.
5880,IV,
5881,IV,"I love my prairies, they are mine"
5882,IV,From high sun to horizon line.

5900,IV,"Then they praised him, soft and low,"
5901,IV,"Call'd him worthy to be loved,"
5902,IV,Truest friend and noblest foe;
5903,IV,Yet she neither spoke nor moved.
5904,IV,"Stole a maiden from her place,"
5905,IV,"Lightly to the warrior stept,"
5906,IV,Took the face-cloth from the face;
5907,IV,Yet she neither moved nor wept.
5908,IV,"Rose a nurse of ninety years,"

5922,IV,From babbling waterfalls
5923,IV,In meadows where the downy seeds are flying;
5924,IV,"And soft the breezes blow,"
5925,IV,And eddying come and go
5926,IV,In faded gardens where the rose is dying.

5928,IV,Among the stubbled corn
5929,IV,"The blithe quail pipes at morn,"
5930,IV,"The merry partridge drums in hidden places,"

5941,IV,

5962,IV,
5963,IV,"Yet, though a sense of grief"
5964,IV,"Comes with the falling leaf,"

5975,IV,The Old Kitchen Floor
5976,IV,
5977,IV,
5978,IV,"Far back, in my musings, my thoughts have been cast"
5979,IV,To the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed.
5980,IV,"I loved all its rooms from the pantry to hall,"
5981,IV,But the blessed old kitchen was dearer than all.
5982,IV,Its chairs and its tables no brighter could be
5983,IV,"And all its surroundings were sacred to me,"
5984,IV,"From the nail in the ceiling to the latch on the door,"
5985,IV,And I loved every crack in that old kitchen floor.
5986,IV,
5987,IV,I remember the fireplace with mouth high and wide
5988,IV,And the old-fashioned oven that stood by its side
5989,IV,Out of which each Thanksgiving came puddings and pies
5990,IV,And they fairly bewildered and dazzled our eyes.
5991,IV,And then old St. Nicholas slyly and still
5992,IV,Came down every Christmas our stockings to fill.
5993,IV,But the dearest of memories laid up in store
5994,IV,Is my mother a-sweeping that old kitchen floor.
5995,IV,
5996,IV,To-night those old musings come back at their will
5997,IV,But the wheel and its music forever are still.
5998,IV,"The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away,"
5999,IV,And the fingers that turned it are mold'ring in clay.
6000,IV,The hearthstone so sacred is just as 'twas then
6001,IV,And the voices of children ring out there again.
6002,IV,"The sun at the window looks in as of yore,"
6003,IV,But it sees other feet on that old kitchen floor.

6008,IV,Rustic Courtship
6009,IV,
6010,IV,
6011,IV,The night was dark when Sam set out
6012,IV,To court old Jones's daughter;
6013,IV,"He kinder felt as if he must,"
6014,IV,And kinder hadn't oughter.
6015,IV,"His heart against his waistcoat throbbed,"
6016,IV,"His feelings had a tussle,"
6017,IV,Which nearly conquered him despite
6018,IV,Six feet of bone and muscle.
6019,IV,
6020,IV,The candle in the window shone
6021,IV,"With a most doleful glimmer,"
6022,IV,"And Sam he felt his courage ooze,"
6023,IV,And through his fingers simmer.
6024,IV,"Says he: ""Now, Sam, don't be a fool,"
6025,IV,"Take courage, shaking doubter,"
6026,IV,"Go on, and pop the question right,"
6027,IV,"For you can't live without her."""
6028,IV,
6029,IV,"But still, as he drew near the house,"
6030,IV,"His knees got in a tremble,"
6031,IV,The beating of his heart ne'er beat
6032,IV,His efforts to dissemble.
6033,IV,"Says he: ""Now, Sam, don't be a goose,"
6034,IV,And let the female wimmin
6035,IV,"Knock all your thoughts a-skelter so,"
6036,IV,"And set your heart a-swimmin'."""
6037,IV,
6038,IV,"So Sam, he kinder raised the latch,"
6039,IV,"His courage also raising,"
6040,IV,"And in a moment he sat inside,"
6041,IV,Cid Jones's crops a-praising.
6042,IV,He tried awhile to talk the farm
6043,IV,"In words half dull, half witty,"
6044,IV,Not knowing that old Jones well knew
6045,IV,His only thought was--Kitty.
6046,IV,
6047,IV,At last the old folks went to bed--
6048,IV,The Joneses were but human;
6049,IV,"Old Jones was something of a man,"
6050,IV,And Mrs. Jones--a woman.
6051,IV,"And Kitty she the pitcher took,"
6052,IV,And started for the cellar;
6053,IV,It wasn't often that she had
6054,IV,So promising a feller.
6055,IV,
6056,IV,"And somehow when she came upstairs,"
6057,IV,"And Sam had drank his cider,"
6058,IV,"There seemed a difference in the chairs,"
6059,IV,And Sam was close beside her;
6060,IV,"His stalwart arm dropped round her waist,"
6061,IV,"Her head dropped on his shoulder,"
6062,IV,"And Sam--well, he had changed his tune"
6063,IV,And grown a trifle bolder.
6064,IV,
6065,IV,"But this, if you live long enough,"
6066,IV,"You surely will discover,"
6067,IV,There's nothing in this world of ours
6068,IV,Except the loved and lover.
6069,IV,The morning sky was growing gray
6070,IV,"As Sam the farm was leaving,"
6071,IV,His face was surely not the face
6072,IV,"Of one half grieved, or grieving."
6073,IV,
6074,IV,"And Kitty she walked smiling back,"
6075,IV,"With blushing face, and slowly;"
6076,IV,There's something in the humblest love
6077,IV,That makes it pure and holy.
6078,IV,"And did he marry her, you ask?"
6079,IV,She stands there with the ladle
6080,IV,A-skimming of the morning's milk--
6081,IV,That's Sam who rocks the cradle.

6092,IV,Swept by a blinding storm of hail and sleet;
6093,IV,The clouded heavens no guiding starlight lend
6094,IV,But o'er the earth in gloom and darkness bend;
6095,IV,"Gigantic shadows, by the night lamps thrown,"
6096,IV,Dance their weird revels fitfully alone.
6097,IV,
6098,IV,"In lofty halls, where fortune takes its ease,"
6099,IV,Sunk in the treasures of all lands and seas;
6100,IV,"In happy homes, where warmth and comfort meet"
6101,IV,The weary traveler with their smiles to greet;
6102,IV,"In lowly dwellings, where the needy swarm"
6103,IV,"Round starving embers, chilling limbs to warm,"
6104,IV,Rises the prayer that makes the sad heart light--
6105,IV,"""Thank God for home, this bitter, bitter night!"""
6106,IV,
6107,IV,But hark! above the beating of the storm
6108,IV,Peals on the startled ear the fire alarm.
6109,IV,"Yon gloomy heaven's aflame with sudden light,"
6110,IV,And heart-beats quicken with a strange affright;
6111,IV,"From tranquil slumbers springs, at duty's call,"
6112,IV,The ready friend no danger can appall;
6113,IV,"Fierce for the conflict, sturdy, true, and brave,"
6114,IV,He hurries forth to battle and to save.
6115,IV,
6116,IV,"From yonder dwelling, fiercely shooting out,"
6117,IV,"Devouring all they coil themselves about,"
6118,IV,"The flaming furies, mounting high and higher,"
6119,IV,Wrap the frail structure in a cloak of fire.
6120,IV,Strong arms are battling with the stubborn foe
6121,IV,In vain attempts their power to overthrow;
6122,IV,"With mocking glee they revel with their prey,"
6123,IV,Defying human skill to check their way.
6124,IV,
6125,IV,"And see! far up above the flame's hot breath,"
6126,IV,Something that's human waits a horrid death;
6127,IV,"A little child, with waving golden hair,"
6128,IV,"Stands, like a phantom, 'mid the horrid glare,--"
6129,IV,"Her pale, sweet face against the window pressed,"
6130,IV,While sobs of terror shake her tender breast.
6131,IV,"And from the crowd beneath, in accents wild,"
6132,IV,"A mother screams, ""O God! my child! my child!"""
6133,IV,
6134,IV,Up goes a ladder. Through the startled throng
6135,IV,A hardy fireman swiftly moves along;
6136,IV,"Mounts sure and fast along the slender way,"
6137,IV,"Fearing no danger, dreading but delay."
6138,IV,"The stifling smoke-clouds lower in his path,"
6139,IV,Sharp tongues of flame assail him in their wrath;
6140,IV,"But up, still up he goes! the goal is won!"
6141,IV,"His strong arm beats the sash, and he is gone!"
6142,IV,
6143,IV,Gone to his death. The wily flames surround
6144,IV,"And burn and beat his ladder to the ground,"
6145,IV,In flaming columns move with quickened beat
6146,IV,To rear a massive wall 'gainst his retreat.
6147,IV,"Courageous heart, thy mission was so pure,"
6148,IV,Suffering humanity must thy loss deplore;
6149,IV,"Henceforth with martyred heroes thou shalt live,"
6150,IV,Crowned with all honors nobleness can give.
6151,IV,
6152,IV,"Nay, not so fast; subdue these gloomy fears;"
6153,IV,"Behold! he quickly on the roof appears,"
6154,IV,"Bearing the tender child, his jacket warm"
6155,IV,"Flung round her shrinking form to guard from harm,"
6156,IV,Up with your ladders! Quick! 'tis but a chance!
6157,IV,"Behold, how fast the roaring flames advance!"
6158,IV,"Quick! quick! brave spirits, to his rescue fly;"
6159,IV,"Up! up! by heavens, this hero must not die!"
6160,IV,
6161,IV,"Silence! he comes along the burning road,"
6162,IV,"Bearing, with tender care, his living load;"
6163,IV,Aha! he totters! Heaven in mercy save
6164,IV,"The good, true heart that can so nobly brave!"
6165,IV,He's up again! and now he's coming fast--
6166,IV,"One moment, and the fiery ordeal's passed--"
6167,IV,"And now he's safe! Bold flames, ye fought in vain."
6168,IV,A happy mother clasps her child again.

6196,IV,"A seaman sought the captain's side,"
6197,IV,A moment whispered low;
6198,IV,The captain's swarthy face grew pale;
6199,IV,He hurried down below.
6200,IV,"Alas, too late! Though quick, and sharp,"
6201,IV,"And clear his orders came,"
6202,IV,No human efforts could avail
6203,IV,To quench th' insidious flame.
6204,IV,
6205,IV,"The bad news quickly reached the deck,"
6206,IV,"It sped from lip to lip,"
6207,IV,And ghastly faces everywhere
6208,IV,Looked from the doomed ship.
6209,IV,"""Is there no hope, no chance of life?"""
6210,IV,A hundred lips implore;
6211,IV,"""But one,"" the captain made reply,"
6212,IV,"""To run the ship on shore."""

6214,IV,"A sailor, whose heroic soul"
6215,IV,"That hour should yet reveal,"
6216,IV,"By name John Maynard, eastern-born,"
6217,IV,Stood calmly at the wheel.
6218,IV,"""Head her southeast!"" the captain shouts,"
6219,IV,"Above the smothered roar,"
6220,IV,"""Head her southeast without delay!"
6221,IV,"Make for the nearest shore!"""
6222,IV,
6223,IV,"No terror pales the helmsman's cheek,"
6224,IV,"Or clouds his dauntless eye,"
6225,IV,"As, in a sailor's measured tone,"
6226,IV,"His voice responds, ""Ay! ay!"""
6227,IV,"Three hundred souls, the steamer's freight,"
6228,IV,"Crowd forward wild with fear,"

6230,IV,Above the deck appear.

6232,IV,"John Maynard watched the nearing flames,"
6233,IV,But still with steady hand
6234,IV,"He grasped the wheel, and steadfastly"
6235,IV,He steered the ship to land.
6236,IV,"""John Maynard, can you still hold out?"""
6237,IV,He heard the captain cry;
6238,IV,A voice from out the stifling smoke
6239,IV,"Faintly responds, ""Ay! ay!"""
6240,IV,
6241,IV,But half a mile! a hundred hands
6242,IV,Stretch eagerly to shore.
6243,IV,But half a mile! That distance sped
6244,IV,Peril shall all be o'er.
6245,IV,"But half a mile! Yet stay, the flames"
6246,IV,"No longer slowly creep,"
6247,IV,"But gather round that helmsman bold,"
6248,IV,"With fierce, impetuous sweep."
6249,IV,
6250,IV,"""John Maynard!"" with an anxious voice"
6251,IV,"The captain cries once more,"
6252,IV,"""Stand by the wheel five minutes yet,"
6253,IV,"And we shall reach the shore."""
6254,IV,Through flame and smoke that dauntless heart
6255,IV,"Responded firmly still,"
6256,IV,"Unawed, though face to face with death,"
6257,IV,"""With God's good help I will!"""
6258,IV,
6259,IV,"The flames approach with giant strides,"
6260,IV,They scorch his hand and brow;
6261,IV,"One arm, disabled, seeks his side,"
6262,IV,Ah! he is conquered now.
6263,IV,"But no, his teeth are firmly set,"
6264,IV,"He crushes down his pain,"
6265,IV,"His knee upon the stanchion pressed,"
6266,IV,He guides the ship again.
6267,IV,
6268,IV,One moment yet! one moment yet!
6269,IV,"Brave heart, thy task is o'er,"
6270,IV,"The pebbles grate beneath the keel,"
6271,IV,The steamer touches shore.
6272,IV,Three hundred grateful voices rise
6273,IV,In praise to God that He
6274,IV,"Hath saved them from the fearful fire,"
6275,IV,And from the engulfing sea.
6276,IV,
6277,IV,"But where is he, that helmsman bold?"
6278,IV,"The captain saw him reel,"
6279,IV,"His nerveless hands released their task,"
6280,IV,He sank beside the wheel.
6281,IV,"The wave received his lifeless corse,"
6282,IV,Blackened with smoke and fire.

6315,IV,"And George is Americans, so he stands still."
6316,IV,"But I am the British, so I must hit"
6317,IV,As hard as ever I can to make him git.
6318,IV,We played Buena Vista one night--
6319,IV,"Tell you, that was an awful hard fight!"
6320,IV,
6321,IV,"Held up our pillers like they was a flag,"

6332,IV,"""Come right on out to this here shed."""
6333,IV,"Tell you, he whipped us till we were sore"
6334,IV,And made us both promise to do it no more.
6335,IV,
6336,IV,"That was a long time ago, and now lodge nights"

6408,IV,Conscience and Future Judgment
6409,IV,
6410,IV,
6411,IV,"I sat alone with my conscience,"
6412,IV,"In a place where time had ceased,"
6413,IV,And we talked of my former living
6414,IV,In the land where the years increased;
6415,IV,And I felt I should have to answer
6416,IV,"The question it might put to me,"
6417,IV,And to face the question and answer
6418,IV,Throughout an eternity.
6419,IV,
6420,IV,The ghosts of forgotten actions
6421,IV,"Came floating before my sight,"
6422,IV,And things that I thought had perished
6423,IV,Were alive with a terrible might;
6424,IV,And the vision of life's dark record
6425,IV,Was an awful thing to face--
6426,IV,Alone with my conscience sitting
6427,IV,In that solemnly silent place.
6428,IV,
6429,IV,"And I thought of a far-away warning,"
6430,IV,"Of a sorrow that was to be mine,"
6431,IV,"In a land that then was the future,"
6432,IV,But now is the present time;
6433,IV,And I thought of my former thinking
6434,IV,Of the judgment day to be;
6435,IV,But sitting alone with my conscience
6436,IV,Seemed judgment enough for me.
6437,IV,
6438,IV,And I wondered if there was a future
6439,IV,To this land beyond the grave;
6440,IV,But no one gave me an answer
6441,IV,And no one came to save.
6442,IV,"Then I felt that the future was present,"
6443,IV,"And the present would never go by,"
6444,IV,For it was but the thought of a future
6445,IV,Become an eternity.
6446,IV,
6447,IV,"Then I woke from my timely dreaming,"
6448,IV,And the vision passed away;
6449,IV,And I knew the far-away warning
6450,IV,Was a warning of yesterday.
6451,IV,And I pray that I may not forget it
6452,IV,"In this land before the grave,"
6453,IV,"That I may not cry out in the future,"
6454,IV,And no one come to save.
6455,IV,
6456,IV,I have learned a solemn lesson
6457,IV,"Which I ought to have known before,"
6458,IV,"And which, though I learned it dreaming,"
6459,IV,I hope to forget no more.
6460,IV,
6461,IV,So I sit alone with my conscience
6462,IV,"In the place where the years increase,"
6463,IV,"And I try to fathom the future,"
6464,IV,In the land where time shall cease.
6465,IV,"And I know of the future judgment,"
6466,IV,"How dreadful soe'er it be,"
6467,IV,That to sit alone with my conscience
6468,IV,Will be judgment enough for me.

6515,IV,"And such inventions! I'm never sure, when I take up my coffee-pot,"

6529,IV,"When 'Bijah and me kep' company, he warn't like this, you know;"

6531,IV,"He was handsome as any pictur then, and he had such a glib, bright way--"

6533,IV,"But when I've been forced to chop wood, and tend to the farm beside,"
6534,IV,"And look at Bijah a-settin' there, I've jest dropped down and cried."
6535,IV,We lost the hull of our turnip crop while he was inventin' a gun
6536,IV,But I counted it one of my marcies when it bu'st before 'twas done.
6537,IV,"So he turned it into a ""burglar alarm."" It ought to give thieves a fright--"
6538,IV,"'Twould scare an honest man out of his wits, ef he sot it off at night."
6539,IV,"Sometimes I wonder if 'Bijah's crazy, he does sech cur'ous things."
6540,IV,Hev I told you about his bedstead yit?--'Twas full of wheels and springs;
6541,IV,"It hed a key to wind it up, and a clock face at the head;"

6543,IV,"That bed got up and shook itself, and bounced you on the floor,"
6544,IV,"And then shet up, jest like a box, so you couldn't sleep any more."
6545,IV,"Wa'al, 'Bijah he fixed it all complete, and he sot it at half-past five,"
6546,IV,But he hadn't mor'n got into it when--dear me! sakes alive!
6547,IV,Them wheels began to whiz and whir! I heered a fearful snap!
6548,IV,"And there was that bedstead, with 'Bijah inside, shet up jest like a trap!"
6549,IV,"I screamed, of course, but 'twan't no use, then I worked that hull long"
6550,IV,night
6551,IV,A-trying to open the pesky thing. At last I got in a fright;
6552,IV,"I couldn't hear his voice inside, and I thought he might be dyin';"
6553,IV,So I took a crow-bar and smashed it in.--There was 'Bijah peacefully
6554,IV,"lyin',"
6555,IV,"Inventin' a way to git out agin. That was all very well to say,"
6556,IV,But I don't b'lieve he'd have found it out if I'd left him in all day.

6656,IV,"With eyes of power and Jove's own brow,"
6657,IV,With all the massive strength that fills
6658,IV,"Thy home-horizon's granite hills,"
6659,IV,With rarest gifts of heart and head
6660,IV,From manliest stock inherited--
6661,IV,"New England's stateliest type of man,"
6662,IV,In port and speech Olympian;
6663,IV,"Whom no one met, at first, but took"
6664,IV,A second awed and wondering look
6665,IV,"(As turned, perchance, the eyes of Greece"
6666,IV,On Phidias' unveiled masterpiece);
6667,IV,"Whose words, in simplest home-spun clad,"
6668,IV,"The Saxon strength of Caedmon's had,"
6669,IV,With power reserved at need to reach
6670,IV,"The Roman forum's loftiest speech,"

6675,IV,Crushing as if with Talus' flail
6676,IV,"Through Error's logic-woven mail,"
6677,IV,And failing only when they tried
6678,IV,"The adamant of the righteous side,--"
6679,IV,"Thou, foiled in aim and hope, bereaved"
6680,IV,"Of old friends, by the new deceived,"
6681,IV,"Too soon for us, too soon for thee,"
6682,IV,"Beside thy lonely Northern sea,"
6683,IV,"Where long and low the marsh-lands spread,"
6684,IV,Laid wearily down thy august head.
6685,IV,
6686,IV,Thou shouldst have lived to feel below
6687,IV,"Thy feet Disunion's fierce upthrow,--"
6688,IV,The late-sprung mine that underlaid
6689,IV,Thy sad concessions vainly made.
6690,IV,Thou shouldst have seen from Sumter's wall
6691,IV,"The star-flag of the Union fall,"
6692,IV,And armed Rebellion pressing on
6693,IV,The broken lines of Washington!
6694,IV,No stronger voice than thine had then
6695,IV,"Called out the utmost might of men,"
6696,IV,To make the Union's charter free
6697,IV,And strengthen law by liberty.
6698,IV,How had that stern arbitrament
6699,IV,"To thy gray age youth's vigor lent,"
6700,IV,Shaming ambition's paltry prize
6701,IV,Before thy disillusioned eyes;
6702,IV,Breaking the spell about thee wound
6703,IV,Like the green withes that Samson bound;
6704,IV,"Redeeming, in one effort grand,"
6705,IV,Thyself and thy imperiled land!
6706,IV,"Ah cruel fate, that closed to thee,"
6707,IV,"O sleeper by the Northern sea,"
6708,IV,The gates of opportunity!
6709,IV,"God fills the gaps of human need,"
6710,IV,Each crisis brings its word and deed.
6711,IV,Wise men and strong we did not lack;
6712,IV,"But still, with memory turning back,"
6713,IV,"In the dark hours we thought of thee,"
6714,IV,And thy lone grave beside the sea.
6715,IV,
6716,IV,"Above that grave the east winds blow,"
6717,IV,And from the marsh-lands drifting slow
6718,IV,"The sea-fog comes, with evermore"
6719,IV,"The wave-wash of a lonely shore,"
6720,IV,"And sea-bird's melancholy cry,"
6721,IV,As Nature fain would typify
6722,IV,"The sadness of a closing scene,"
6723,IV,The loss of that which should have been.
6724,IV,"But, where thy native mountains bare"
6725,IV,"Their foreheads to diviner air,"
6726,IV,"Fit emblem of enduring fame,"
6727,IV,One lofty summit keeps thy name.
6728,IV,For thee the cosmic forces did
6729,IV,"The rearing of that pyramid,"
6730,IV,The prescient ages shaping with
6731,IV,"Fire, flood, and frost thy monolith."
6732,IV,Sunrise and sunset lay thereon
6733,IV,"With hands of light their benison,"
6734,IV,The stars of midnight pause to set
6735,IV,Their jewels in its coronet.
6736,IV,And evermore that mountain mass
6737,IV,Seems climbing from the shadowy pass

7156,IV,"There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs"
7157,IV,"And islands of Winander!--many a time,"
7158,IV,"At evening, when the earliest stars began"
7159,IV,"To move along the edges of the hills,"
7160,IV,"Rising or setting, would he stand alone,"
7161,IV,"Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;"
7162,IV,"And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands"
7163,IV,Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
7164,IV,"Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,"
7165,IV,"Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,"
7166,IV,"That they might answer him,--And they would shout"
7167,IV,"Across the watery vale, and shout again,"
7168,IV,"Responsive to his call,--with quivering peals,"
7169,IV,"And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud"
7170,IV,Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
7171,IV,"Of jocund din! and, when there came a pause"
7172,IV,"Of silence such as baffled his best skill,"
7173,IV,"Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung"
7174,IV,"Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise"
7175,IV,Has carried far into his heart the voice
7176,IV,Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
7177,IV,Would enter unawares into his mind
7178,IV,"With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,"
7179,IV,"Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received"
7180,IV,Into the bosom of the steady lake.

7183,IV,Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
7184,IV,Where he was born and bred: the church-yard hangs
7185,IV,Upon a slope above the village-school;
7186,IV,And through that church-yard when my way has led
7187,IV,"On Summer-evenings, I believe, that there"
7188,IV,A long half-hour together I have stood
7189,IV,Mute--looking at the grave in which he lies!

7200,IV,"The Quangle Wangle sat,"
7201,IV,"But his face you could not see,"
7202,IV,On account of his Beaver Hat.
7203,IV,"For his hat was a hundred and two feet wide,"
7204,IV,"With ribbons and bibbons on every side,"
7205,IV,"And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,"
7206,IV,So that nobody ever could see the face

7215,IV,That very few people come this way
7216,IV,"And that life on the whole is far from gay!"""
7217,IV,Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.
7218,IV,
7219,IV,But there came to the Crumpetty Tree
7220,IV,Mr. and Mrs. Canary;
7221,IV,"And they said, ""Did ever you see"

7238,IV,
7239,IV,"And the Golden Grouse came there,"
7240,IV,"And the Pobble who has no toes,"
7241,IV,"And the small Olympian bear,"
7242,IV,And the Dong with a luminous nose.
7243,IV,"And the Blue Baboon who played the flute,"
7244,IV,"And the Orient Calf from the Land of Tute,"
7245,IV,"And the Attery Squash, and the Bisky Bat,--"
7246,IV,All came and built on the lovely Hat
7247,IV,Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.
7248,IV,
7249,IV,And the Quangle Wangle said
7250,IV,"To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,"
7251,IV,"""When all these creatures move"
7252,IV,"What a wonderful noise there'll be!"""
7253,IV,And at night by the light of the Mulberry Moon
7254,IV,"They danced to the Flute of the Blue Baboon,"
7255,IV,"On the broad green leaves of the Crumpetty Tree,"
7256,IV,"And all were as happy as happy could be,"

7273,I,

7276,I,"""Oh, bring me pearls and diamonds great,"

7283,I,

7286,I,And among the gold of her blithesome hair
7287,I,Dim shone the golden crown.
7288,I,
7289,I,"""There came a bird this morning,"

7292,I,"'Ask thou for the Singing Leaves.'"""
7293,I,
7294,I,Then the brow of the King swelled crimson
7295,I,With a flush of angry scorn:
7296,I,"""Well have ye spoken, my two eldest,"

7298,I,
7299,I,"""But she, like a thing of peasant race,"

7306,II,
7307,II,He mounted and rode three days and nights
7308,II,"Till he came to Vanity Fair,"
7309,II,"And 'twas easy to buy the gems and the silk,"
7310,II,But no Singing Leaves were there.
7311,II,
7312,II,"Then deep in the greenwood rode he,"
7313,II,"And asked of every tree,"
7314,II,"""Oh, if you have, ever a Singing Leaf,"
7315,II,"I pray you give it me!"""
7316,II,
7317,II,"But the trees all kept their counsel,"
7318,II,"And never a word said they,"
7319,II,Only there sighed from the pine-tops
7320,II,A music of seas far away.
7321,II,
7322,II,Only the pattering aspen
7323,II,"Made a sound of growing rain,"
7324,II,That fell ever faster and faster.
7325,II,Then faltered to silence again.
7326,II,
7327,II,"""Oh, where shall I find a little foot-page"
7328,II,"That would win both hose and shoon,"
7329,II,And will bring to me the Singing Leaves
7330,II,"If they grow under the moon?"""
7331,II,
7332,II,"Then lightly turned him Walter the page,"
7333,II,By the stirrup as he ran:
7334,II,"""Now pledge you me the truesome word"
7335,II,"Of a king and gentleman,"
7336,II,
7337,II,"""That you will give me the first, first thing"
7338,II,"You meet at your castle-gate,"
7339,II,"And the Princess shall get the Singing Leaves,"
7340,II,"Or mine be a traitor's fate."""
7341,II,
7342,II,The King's head dropt upon his breast
7343,II,"A moment, as it might be;"
7344,II,"'Twill be my dog, he thought, and said,"
7345,II,"""My faith I plight to thee."""
7346,II,
7347,II,Then Walter took from next his heart
7348,II,"A packet small and thin,"

7359,III,
7360,III,"""Lo, here the Singing Leaves,"" quoth he,"
7361,III,"""And woe, but they cost me dear!"""
7362,III,"She took the packet, and the smile"
7363,III,Deepened down beneath the tear.
7364,III,
7365,III,"It deepened down till it reached her heart,"
7366,III,"And then gushed up again,"
7367,III,And lighted her tears as the sudden sun
7368,III,Transfigures the summer rain.
7369,III,
7370,III,"And the first Leaf, when it was opened,"
7371,III,"Sang: ""I am Walter the page,"
7372,III,And the songs I sing 'neath thy window
7373,III,"Are my only heritage."""
7374,III,
7375,III,"And the second Leaf sang: ""But in the land"
7376,III,"That is neither on earth nor sea,"
7377,III,My lute and I are lords of more
7378,III,"Than thrice this kingdom's fee."""
7379,III,
7380,III,"And the third Leaf sang, ""Be mine! Be mine!"""
7381,III,"And ever it sang, ""Be mine!"""
7382,III,"Then sweeter it sang and ever sweeter,"
7383,III,"And said, ""I am thine, thine, thine!"""
7384,III,
7385,III,"At the first Leaf she grew pale enough,"
7386,III,"At the second she turned aside,"
7387,III,"At the third,'twas as if a lily flushed"
7388,III,With a rose's red heart's tide.
7389,III,
7390,III,"""Good counsel gave the bird,"" said she,"

7394,III,
7395,III,"She brought to him her beauty and truth,"

7679,III,"And one took root and sprouted up,"
7680,III,And grew into a tree.
7681,III,"Love sought its shade, at evening time,"
7682,III,To breathe his early vows;
7683,III,"And age was pleased, in heats of noon,"
7684,III,To bask beneath its boughs;

7690,III,A little spring had lost its way
7691,III,"Amid the grass and fern,"
7692,III,A passing stranger scooped a well
7693,III,Where weary men might turn;
7694,III,"He walled it in, and hung with care"
7695,III,A ladle at the brink;
7696,III,"He thought not of the deed he did,"
7697,III,But judged that all might drink.
7698,III,"He paused again, and lo! the well,"
7699,III,"By summer never dried,"
7700,III,Had cooled ten thousand parching tongues
7701,III,And saved a life beside.

7703,III,A dreamer dropped a random thought;
7704,III,"'Twas old, and yet 'twas new;"

7709,III,"A lamp of life, a beacon ray,"
7710,III,A monitory flame;

8043,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I looked at John,--John looked at me,"
8044,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"(Dear, patient John, who loves me yet"
8045,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As well as though my locks were jet.)
8046,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when I found that I must speak,"
8047,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,My voice seemed strangely low and weak;
8048,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Tell me again what Robert said"";"
8049,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And then I listening bent my head.
8050,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""This is his letter:"
8051,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,'I will give
8052,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A house and land while you shall live,"
8053,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"If, in return, from out your seven,"
8054,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"One child to me for aye is given.'"""
8055,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8056,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I looked at John's old garments worn,"
8057,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I thought of all that John had borne
8058,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of poverty, and work, and care,"
8059,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Which I, though willing, could not share;"
8060,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of seven hungry mouths to feed,"
8061,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of seven little children's need,"
8062,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And then of this.
8063,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Come John,"" said I,"
8064,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""We'll choose among them as they lie"
8065,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Asleep""; so walking hand in hand,"
8066,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Dear John and I surveyed our band.
8067,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8068,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"First to the cradle lightly stepped,"
8069,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where Lilian, the baby, slept;"
8070,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Her damp curls lay, like gold alight,"
8071,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A glory 'gainst the pillow white;
8072,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Softly her father stooped to lay
8073,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"His rough hand down in loving way,"
8074,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When dream or whisper made her stir,"
8075,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And huskily he said, ""Not _her_."""
8076,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We stooped beside the trundle-bed,"
8077,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And one long ray of lamp-light shed
8078,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Athwart the boyish faces there,"
8079,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In sleep so pitiful and fair.
8080,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I saw on Jamie's rough red cheek
8081,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A tear undried; ere John could speak,"
8082,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""He's but a baby too,"" said I,"
8083,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And kissed him as we hurried by.
8084,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Pale, patient Robby's angel face"
8085,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Still in his sleep bore suffering's trace;
8086,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""No, for a thousand crowns not him,"""
8087,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He whispered, while our eyes were dim."
8088,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Poor Dick! sad Dick! our wayward son,"
8089,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Turbulent, reckless, idle one,--"
8090,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Could _he_ be spared? ""Nay, He who gave"
8091,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Bids us befriend him to the grave;
8092,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Only a mother's heart can be
8093,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Patient enough for such as he;
8094,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so,"" said John, ""I would not dare"
8095,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To send him from her bedside prayer."""
8096,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then stole we softly up above,"
8097,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And knelt by Mary, child of love;"
8098,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Perhaps for _her_ 'twould better be,"""
8099,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I said to John. Quite silently
8100,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He lifted up a curl, that lay"
8101,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Across her cheek in wilful way,"
8102,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And shook his head; ""Nay, love, not thee"";"
8103,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The while my heart beat audibly.
8104,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Only one more, our eldest lad,"
8105,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Trusty and truthful, good and glad,--"
8106,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So like his father: ""No, John, no;"
8107,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I cannot, will not, let him go!"""
8108,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8109,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so we wrote, in courteous way,"
8110,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We could not give one child away;
8111,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And afterward toil lighter seemed,"
8112,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Thinking of that of which we dreamed;
8113,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Happy, in truth, that not one face"
8114,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We missed from its accustomed place;
8115,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thankful to work for all the seven,"
8116,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Trusting then to One in heaven.

8162,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And still and still the barges fill, and still across the deep,"

8164,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8165,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And now they're forming at the Point; and now the lines advance:

8168,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Quick bursts and loud the flashing cloud, and rolls from wing to wing;"
8169,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But on the height our bulwark stands, tremendous in its gloom,--"

8240,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's a tale I know about them, were I poet I would tell;"
8241,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Soft it comes, with perfume laden, like a breath of country air"
8242,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wafted down the filthy alley, bringing fragrant odors there."
8243,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8244,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In that vile and filthy alley, long ago one winter's day,"
8245,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Dying quick of want and fever, hapless, patient Billy lay,"
8246,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"While beside him sat his sister, in the garret's dismal gloom,"
8247,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Cheering with her gentle presence Billy's pathway to the tomb.
8248,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8249,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Many a tale of elf and fairy did she tell the dying child,"
8250,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Till his eyes lost half their anguish, and his worn, wan features smiled;"
8251,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tales herself had heard haphazard, caught amid the Babel roar,"
8252,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Lisped about by tiny gossips playing round their mothers' door.
8253,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8254,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then she felt his wasted fingers tighten feebly as she told
8255,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How beyond this dismal alley lay a land of shining gold,"
8256,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where, when all the pain was over,--where, when all the tears were shed,--"
8257,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He would be a white-frocked angel, with a gold thing on his head."
8258,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8259,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then she told some garbled story of a kind-eyed Saviour's love,"
8260,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How He'd built for little children great big playgrounds up above,"
8261,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where they sang and played at hopscotch and at horses all the day,"
8262,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And where beadles and policemen never frightened them away.
8263,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8264,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"This was Nell's idea of heaven,--just a bit of what she'd heard,"
8265,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With a little bit invented, and a little bit inferred."
8266,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But her brother lay and listened, and he seemed to understand,"
8267,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For he closed his eyes and murmured he could see the promised land.
8268,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8269,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Yes,"" he whispered, ""I can see it, I can see it, sister Nell,"

8275,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In the garret and the alley, where they starved to pay the rent;"
8276,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Where a drunken father's curses and a drunken mother's blows
8277,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Drove her forth into the gutter from the day's dawn to its close.
8278,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8279,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But she knew enough, this outcast, just to tell this sinking boy,"

8291,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I can't help thinking, Nelly, I should like to take away"
8292,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Something, sister, that you gave me, I might look at every day."
8293,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8294,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""In the summer you remember how the mission took us out"
8295,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To a great green lovely meadow, where we played and ran about,"
8296,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the van that took us halted by a sweet bright patch of land,"
8297,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where the fine red blossoms grew, dear, half as big as mother's hand."
8298,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8299,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Nell, I asked the good kind teacher what they called such flowers as"
8300,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"those,"
8301,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he told me, I remember, that the pretty name was rose."
8302,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I have never seen them since, dear--how I wish that I had one!"
8303,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Just to keep and think of you, Nell, when I'm up beyond the sun."""
8304,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8305,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not a word said little Nelly; but at night, when Billy slept,"
8306,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,On she flung her scanty garments and then down the stairs she crept.
8307,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Through the silent streets of London she ran nimbly as a fawn,"
8308,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Running on and running ever till the night had changed to dawn.
8309,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8310,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When the foggy sun had risen, and the mist had cleared away,"
8311,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All around her, wrapped in snowdrift, there the open country lay."
8312,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She was tired, her limbs were frozen, and the roads had cut her feet,"
8313,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But there came no flowery gardens her poor tearful eyes to greet.
8314,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8315,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She had traced the road by asking, she had learnt the way to go;"
8316,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She had found the famous meadow--it was wrapped in cruel snow;
8317,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not a buttercup or daisy, not a single verdant blade"
8318,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Showed its head above its prison. Then she knelt her down and prayed;
8319,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8320,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With her eyes upcast to heaven, down she sank upon the ground,"
8321,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And she prayed to God to tell her where the roses might be found.
8322,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then the cold blast numbed her senses, and her sight grew strangely dim;"
8323,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And a sudden, awful tremor seemed to seize her every limb."
8324,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8325,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Oh, a rose!"" she moaned, ""good Jesus,--just a rose to take to Bill!"""
8326,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And as she prayed a chariot came thundering down the hill;
8327,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And a lady sat there, toying with a red rose, rare and sweet;"
8328,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As she passed she flung it from her, and it fell at Nelly's feet."
8329,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8330,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Just a word her lord had spoken caused her ladyship to fret,"
8331,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the rose had been his present, so she flung it in a pet;"
8332,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But the poor, half-blinded Nelly thought it fallen from the skies,"
8333,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And she murmured, ""Thank you, Jesus!"" as she clasped the dainty prize."
8334,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8335,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lo! that night from but the alley did a child's soul pass away,"
8336,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,From dirt and sin and misery up to where God's children play.
8337,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lo! that night a wild, fierce snowstorm burst in fury o'er the land,"

8340,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Billy's dead, and gone to glory--so is Billy's sister Nell;"

8359,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'm old, you know, and I wander--it's a way with old women and men,"
8360,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For their lives lie all behind them, and their thoughts go far away,"
8361,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And are tempted afield, like children lost on a summer day."
8362,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8363,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The years must be five-and-twenty that have passed since that awful night,"
8364,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I see it again this evening, I can never shut out the sight."
8365,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We were only a few weeks married, I and the wife, you know,"
8366,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When we had an offer for Melbourne, and made up our minds to go."
8367,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8368,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We'd acted together in England, traveling up and down"
8369,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With a strolling band of players, going from town to town;"
8370,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We played the lovers together--we were leading lady and gent--
8371,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And at last we played in earnest, and straight to the church we went."
8372,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8373,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The parson gave us his blessing, and I gave Nellie the ring,"
8374,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And swore that I'd love and cherish, and endow her with everything."
8375,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How we smiled at that part of the service when I said ""I thee endow""!"
8376,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But as to the ""love and cherish,"" I meant to keep that vow."
8377,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8378,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We were only a couple of strollers; we had coin when the show was good,"
8379,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When it wasn't we went without it, and we did the best we could."
8380,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We were happy, and loved each other, and laughed at the shifts we made,--"
8381,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where love makes plenty of sunshine, there poverty casts no shade."
8382,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8383,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Well, at last we got to London, and did pretty well for a bit;"
8384,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then the business dropped to nothing, and the manager took a flit,--"
8385,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Stepped off one Sunday morning, forgetting the treasury call;"
8386,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But our luck was in, and we managed right on our feet to fall."
8387,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8388,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We got an offer for Melbourne,--got it that very week."
8389,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Those were the days when thousands went over to fortune seek,"
8390,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The days of the great gold fever, and a manager thought the spot"
8391,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Good for a ""spec,"" and took us as actors among his lot."
8392,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8393,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We hadn't a friend in England--we'd only ourselves to please--
8394,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And we jumped at the chance of trying our fortune across the seas.
8395,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We went on a sailing vessel, and the journey was long and rough;"
8396,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We hadn't been out a fortnight before we had had enough.
8397,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8398,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But use is a second nature, and we'd got not to mind a storm,"
8399,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When misery came upon us,--came in a hideous form."
8400,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My poor little wife fell ailing, grew worse, and at last so bad"
8401,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That the doctor said she was dying,--I thought 'twould have sent me mad,--"
8402,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8403,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Dying where leagues of billows seemed to shriek for their prey,"
8404,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the nearest land was hundreds--aye, thousands--of miles away."
8405,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She raved one night in a fever, and the next lay still as death,"
8406,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So still I'd to bend and listen for the faintest sign of breath.
8407,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8408,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She seemed in a sleep, and sleeping, with a smile on her thin, wan face,--"
8409,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She passed away one morning, while I prayed to the throne of grace."
8410,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I knelt in the little cabin, and prayer after prayer I said,"
8411,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Till the surgeon came and told me it was useless--my wife was dead!
8412,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8413,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Dead! I wouldn't believe it. They forced me away that night,"
8414,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For I raved in my wild despairing, the shock sent me mad outright."
8415,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I was shut in the farthest cabin, and I beat my head on the side,"
8416,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And all day long in my madness, ""They've murdered her!"" I cried."
8417,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8418,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"They locked me away from my fellows,--put me in cruel chains,"
8419,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It seems I had seized a weapon to beat out the surgeon's brains.
8420,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I cried in my wild, mad fury, that he was a devil sent"
8421,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To gloat o'er the frenzied anguish with which my heart was rent.
8422,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8423,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I spent that night with the irons heavy upon my wrists,"
8424,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And my wife lay dead quite near me. I beat with my fettered fists,"
8425,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Beat at my prison panels, and then--O God!--and then"
8426,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I heard the shrieks of women and the tramp of hurrying men.
8427,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8428,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I heard the cry, ""Ship afire!"" caught up by a hundred throats,"
8429,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And over the roar the captain shouting to lower the boats;
8430,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then cry upon cry, and curses, and the crackle of burning wood,"
8431,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the place grew hot as a furnace, I could feel it where I stood."
8432,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8433,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I beat at the door and shouted, but never a sound came back,"
8434,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the timbers above me started, till right through a yawning crack"
8435,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I could see the flames shoot upward, seizing on mast and sail,"
8436,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Fanned in their burning fury by the breath of the howling gale.
8437,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8438,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I dashed at the door in fury, shrieking, ""I will not die!"
8439,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Die in this burning prison!""--but I caught no answering cry."
8440,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then, suddenly, right upon me, the flames crept up with a roar,"
8441,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And their fiery tongues shot forward, cracking my prison door."
8442,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8443,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I was free--with the heavy iron door dragging me down to death;
8444,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I fought my way to the cabin, choked with the burning breath"
8445,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of the flames that danced around me like man-mocking fiends at play,"
8446,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And then--O God! I can see it, and shall to my dying day."
8447,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8448,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There lay my Nell as they'd left her, dead in her berth that night;"
8449,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The flames flung a smile on her features,--a horrible, lurid light."
8450,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"God knows how I reached and touched her, but I found myself by her side;"
8451,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I thought she was living a moment, I forgot that my Nell had died."
8452,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8453,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In the shock of those awful seconds reason came back to my brain;
8454,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I heard a sound as of breathing, and then a low cry of pain;"
8455,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Oh, was there mercy in heaven? Was there a God in the skies?"
8456,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The dead woman's lips were moving, the dead woman opened her eyes."
8457,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8458,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I cursed like a madman raving--I cried to her, ""Nell! my Nell!"""
8459,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"They had left us alone and helpless, alone in that burning hell;"
8460,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They had left us alone to perish--forgotten me living--and she
8461,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Had been left for the fire to bear her to heaven, instead of the sea."
8462,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8463,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I clutched at her, roused her shrieking, the stupor was on her still;"
8464,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I seized her in spite of my fetters,--fear gave a giant's will."
8465,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"God knows how I did it, but blindly I fought through the flames and the"
8466,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,wreck
8467,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Up--up to the air, and brought her safe to the untouched deck."
8468,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8469,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We'd a moment of life together,--a moment of life, the time"
8470,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For one last word to each other,--'twas a moment supreme, sublime."
8471,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"From the trance we'd for death mistaken, the heat had brought her to life,"
8472,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I was fettered and helpless, so we lay there, husband and wife!"
8473,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8474,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was but a moment, but ages seemed to have passed away,"
8475,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When a shout came over the water, and I looked, and lo, there lay,"
8476,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Right away from the vessel, a boat that was standing by;"
8477,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"They had seen our forms on the vessel, as the flames lit up the sky."
8478,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8479,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I shouted a prayer to Heaven, then called to my wife, and she"
8480,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tore with new strength at my fetters--God helped her, and I was free;"
8481,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then over the burning bulwarks we leaped for one chance of life.
8482,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Did they save us? Well, here I am, sir, and yonder's my dear old wife."
8483,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8484,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We were out in the boat till daylight, when a great ship passing by"
8485,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Took us on board, and at Melbourne landed us by and by."
8486,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We've played many parts in dramas since we went on that famous trip,"
8487,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But ne'er such a scene together as we had on the burning ship!

8495,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8496,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8497,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A sad-faced little fellow sits alone in deep disgrace,"
8498,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's a lump arising in his throat, tears streaming down his face;"
8499,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He wandered from his playmates, for he doesn't want to hear"
8500,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Their shouts of merry laughter, since the world has lost its cheer;"
8501,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He has sipped the cup of sorrow, he has drained the bitter glass,"
8502,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And his heart is fairly breaking; he's the boy who didn't pass.
8503,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8504,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In the apple tree the robin sings a cheery little song,"
8505,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But he doesn't seem to hear it, showing plainly something's wrong;"
8506,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Comes his faithful little spaniel for a romp and bit of play,"
8507,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But the troubled little fellow sternly bids him go away.
8508,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All alone he sits in sorrow, with his hair a tangled mass,"
8509,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And his eyes are red with weeping; he's the boy who didn't pass.
8510,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8511,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How he hates himself for failing, he can hear his playmates jeer,"
8512,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For they've left him with the dullards--gone ahead a half a year,"
8513,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he tried so hard to conquer, oh, he tried to do his best,"
8514,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But now he knows, he's weaker, yes, and duller than the rest."
8515,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He's ashamed to tell his mother, for he thinks she'll hate him, too--"
8516,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The little boy who didn't pass, who failed of getting through."
8517,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8518,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Oh, you who boast a laughing son, and speak of him as bright,"
8519,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And you who love a little girl who comes to you at night
8520,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With smiling eyes, with dancing feet, with honors from her school,"
8521,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Turn to that lonely little boy who thinks he is a fool,"
8522,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And take him kindly by the hand, the dullest in his class,"
8523,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He is the one who most needs love, the boy who didn't pass."

8529,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8530,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8531,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Yes, it's a quiet station, but it suits me well enough;"
8532,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I want a bit of the smooth now, for I've had my share o' rough."
8533,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"This berth that the company gave me, they gave as the work was light;"
8534,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I was never fit for the signals after one awful night,"
8535,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'd been in the box from a younker, and I'd never felt the strain"
8536,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of the lives at my right hand's mercy in every passing train.
8537,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"One day there was something happened, and it made my nerves go queer,"
8538,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And it's all through that as you find me the station-master here.
8539,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8540,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I was on at the box down yonder--that's where we turn the mails,"
8541,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And specials, and fast expresses, on to the center rails;"
8542,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The side's for the other traffic--the luggage and local slows.
8543,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was rare hard work at Christmas, when double the traffic grows."
8544,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I've been in the box down yonder nigh sixteen hours a day,"
8545,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Till my eyes grew dim and heavy, and my thoughts went all astray;"
8546,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I've worked the points half-sleeping--and once I slept outright,"
8547,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Till the roar of the Limited woke me, and I nearly died with fright."
8548,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8549,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then I thought of the lives in peril, and what might have been their fate"
8550,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Had I sprung to the points that evening a tenth of a tick too late;
8551,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And a cold and ghastly shiver ran icily through my frame
8552,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As I fancied the public clamor, the trial, and bitter shame."
8553,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I could see the bloody wreckage--I could see the mangled slain--
8554,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the picture was seared for ever, blood-red, on my heated brain."
8555,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That moment my nerve was shattered, for I couldn't shut out the thought"
8556,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of the lives I held in my keeping, and the ruin that might be wrought."
8557,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8558,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That night in our little cottage, as I kissed our sleeping child,"
8559,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My wife looked up from her sewing, and told me, as she smiled,"
8560,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That Johnny had made his mind up--he'd be a pointsman, too."
8561,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""He says when he's big, like daddy, he'll work in the box with you."""
8562,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I frowned, for my heart was heavy, and my wife she saw the look;"
8563,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Lord bless you! my little Alice could read me like a book.
8564,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'd to tell her of what had happened, and I said that I must leave,"
8565,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For a pointsman's arm ain't trusty when terror lurks in his sleeve.
8566,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8567,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But she cheered me up in a minute, and that night, ere we went to sleep,"
8568,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She made me give her a promise, which I swore that I'd always keep--"
8569,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was always to do my duty. ""Do that, and then, come what will,"
8570,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You'll have no worry."" said Alice, ""if things go well or ill."
8571,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's something that always tells us the thing that we ought to do""--"
8572,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My wife was a bit religious, and in with the chapel crew."
8573,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I knew she was talking reason, and I said to myself, says I,"
8574,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""I won't give in like a coward, it's a scare that'll soon go by."""
8575,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8576,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Now, the very next day the missus had to go to the market town;"
8577,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She'd the Christmas things to see to, and she wanted to buy a gown."
8578,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She'd be gone for a spell, for the Parley didn't come back till eight,"
8579,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I knew, on a Christmas Eve, too, the trains would be extra late."
8580,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So she settled to leave me Johnny, and then she could turn the key--"
8581,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For she'd have some parcels to carry, and the boy would be safe with me."
8582,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He was five, was our little Johnny, and quiet, and nice, and good--"
8583,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He was mad to go with daddy, and I'd often promised he should."
8584,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8585,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was noon when the missus started,--her train went by my box;"
8586,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She could see, as she passed my window, her darling's curly locks,"
8587,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I lifted him up to mammy, and he kissed his little hand,"
8588,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then sat, like a mouse, in the corner, and thought it was fairyland."
8589,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But somehow I fell a-thinking of a scene that would not fade,"
8590,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of how I had slept on duty, until I grew afraid;"
8591,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For the thought would weigh upon me, one day I might come to lie"
8592,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In a felon's cell for the slaughter of those I had doomed to die.
8593,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8594,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The fit that had come upon me, like a hideous nightmare seemed,"
8595,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Till I rubbed my eyes and started like a sleeper who has dreamed.
8596,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For a time the box had vanished--I'd worked like a mere machine--
8597,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My mind had been on the wander, and I'd neither heard nor seen,"
8598,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With a start I thought of Johnny, and I turned the boy to seek,"
8599,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then I uttered a groan of anguish, for my lips refused to speak;"
8600,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,There had flashed such a scene of horror swift on my startled sight
8601,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That it curdled my blood in terror and sent my red lips white.
8602,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8603,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It was all in one awful moment--I saw that the boy was lost:
8604,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He had gone for a toy, I fancied, some child from a train had tossed;"
8605,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The local was easing slowly to stop at the station here,"
8606,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the limited mail was coming, and I had the line to clear."
8607,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I could hear the roar of the engine, I could almost feel its breath,"
8608,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And right on the center metals stood my boy in the jaws of death;
8609,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"On came the fierce fiend, tearing straight for the center line,"
8610,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the hand that must wreck or save it, O merciful God, was mine!"
8611,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8612,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,'Twas a hundred lives or Johnny's. O Heaven! what could I do?--
8613,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Up to God's ear that moment a wild, fierce question flew--"
8614,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""What shall I do, O Heaven?"" and sudden and loud and clear"
8615,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"On the wind came the words, ""Your duty,"" borne to my listening ear."
8616,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then I set my teeth, and my breathing was fierce and short and quick."
8617,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""My boy!"" I cried, but he heard not; and then I went blind and sick;"
8618,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The hot black smoke of the engine came with a rush before,"
8619,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I turned the mail to the center, and by it flew with a roar."
8620,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8621,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then I sank on my knees in horror, and hid my ashen face--"
8622,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I had given my child to Heaven; his life was a hundred's grace.
8623,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Had I held my hand a moment, I had hurled the flying mail"
8624,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To shatter the creeping local that stood on the other rail!
8625,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where is my boy, my darling? O God! let me hide my eyes."
8626,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,How can I look--his father--on that which there mangled lies?
8627,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That voice!--O merciful Heaven!--'tis the child's, and he calls my name!"
8628,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I hear, but I cannot see him, for my eyes are filled with flame."
8629,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8630,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I knew no more that night, sir, for I fell, as I heard the boy;"
8631,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The place reeled round, and I fainted,--swooned with the sudden joy."
8632,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I heard on the Christmas morning, when I woke in my own warm bed"
8633,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With Alice's arms around me, and a strange wild dream in my head,"
8634,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That she'd come by the early local, being anxious about the lad,"
8635,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And had seen him there on the metals, and the sight nigh drove her mad--"
8636,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She had seen him just as the engine of the Limited closed my view,"
8637,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And she leapt on the line and saved him just as the mail dashed through.
8638,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8639,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She was back in the train in a second, and both were safe and sound;"
8640,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The moment they stopped at the station she ran here, and I was found"
8641,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With my eyes like a madman's glaring, and my face a ghastly white:"
8642,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I heard the boy, and I fainted, and I hadn't my wits that night."
8643,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Who told me to do my duty? What voice was that on the wind?
8644,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Was it fancy that brought it to me? or were there God's lips behind?
8645,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,If I hadn't 'a' done my duty--had I ventured to disobey--
8646,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,My bonny boy and his mother might have died by my hand that day.

8661,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,On chaliced flowers that lies;
8662,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And winking Mary-buds begin

8674,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8675,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8676,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In a dark and dismal alley where the sunshine never came,"
8677,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Dwelt a little lad named Tommy, sickly, delicate, and lame;"
8678,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He had never yet been healthy, but had lain since he was born"
8679,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Dragging out his weak existence well nigh hopeless and forlorn.
8680,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8681,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He was six, was little Tommy, 'twas just five years ago"
8682,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Since his drunken mother dropped him, and the babe was crippled so."
8683,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He had never known the comfort of a mother's tender care,"
8684,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But her cruel blows and curses made his pain still worse to bear.
8685,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8686,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There he lay within the cellar, from the morning till the night,"
8687,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Starved, neglected, cursed, ill-treated, nought to make his dull life"
8688,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,bright;
8689,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not a single friend to love him, not a loving thing to love--"
8690,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For he knew not of a Saviour, or a heaven up above."
8691,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8692,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"'Twas a quiet, summer evening, and the alley, too, was still;"
8693,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tommy's little heart was sinking, and he felt so lonely, till,"
8694,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Floating up the quiet alley, wafted inwards from the street,"
8695,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Came the sound of some one singing, sounding, oh! so clear and sweet."
8696,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8697,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Eagerly did Tommy listen as the singing came--
8698,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Oh! that he could see the singer! How he wished he wasn't lame.
8699,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then he called and shouted loudly, till the singer heard the sound,"
8700,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And on noting whence it issued, soon the little cripple found."
8701,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8702,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"'Twas a maiden rough and rugged, hair unkempt, and naked feet,"
8703,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All her garments torn and ragged, her appearance far from neat;"
8704,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""So yer called me,"" said the maiden, ""wonder wot yer wants o' me;"
8705,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Most folks call me Singing Jessie; wot may your name chance to be?"""
8706,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8707,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""My name's Tommy; I'm a cripple, and I want to hear you sing,"
8708,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For it makes me feel so happy--sing me something, anything,"""
8709,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Jessie laughed, and answered smiling, ""I can't stay here very long,"
8710,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I'll sing a hymn to please you, wot I calls the 'Glory Song.'"""
8711,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8712,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then she sang to him of heaven, pearly gates, and streets of gold,"
8713,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Where the happy angel children are not starved or nipped with cold;
8714,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But where happiness and gladness never can decrease or end,"
8715,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And where kind and loving Jesus is their Sovereign and their Friend.
8716,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8717,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Oh! how Tommy's eyes did glisten as he drank in every word
8718,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As it fell from ""Singing Jessie""--was it true, what he had heard?"
8719,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so anxiously he asked her, ""Is there really such a place?"""
8720,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And a tear began to trickle down his pallid little face.
8721,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8722,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Tommy, you're a little heathen; why, it's up beyond the sky,"
8723,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And if yer will love the Saviour, yer shall go there when yer die."""
8724,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Then,"" said Tommy, ""tell me, Jessie, how can I the Saviour love,"
8725,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When I'm down in this 'ere cellar, and He's up in heaven above?"""
8726,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8727,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So the little ragged maiden who had heard at Sunday School
8728,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All about the way to heaven, and the Christian's golden rule,"
8729,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Taught the little cripple Tommy how to love, and how to pray,"
8730,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then she sang a ""Song of Jesus,"" kissed his cheek and went away."
8731,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8732,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tommy lay within the cellar which had grown so dark and cold,"
8733,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Thinking all about the children in the streets of shining gold;
8734,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he heeded not the darkness of that damp and chilly room,"
8735,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For the joy in Tommy's bosom could disperse the deepest gloom.
8736,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8737,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Oh! if I could only see it,"" thought the cripple, as he lay,"
8738,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Jessie said that Jesus listens and I think I'll try and pray"";"
8739,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So he put his hands together, and he closed his little eyes,"
8740,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And in accents weak, yet earnest, sent this message to the skies:--"
8741,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8742,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Gentle Jesus, please forgive me as I didn't know afore,"
8743,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That yer cared for little cripples who is weak and very poor,"
8744,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And I never heard of heaven till that Jessie came to-day
8745,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And told me all about it, so I wants to try and pray."
8746,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8747,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Yer can see me, can't yer, Jesus? Jessie told me that yer could,"
8748,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I somehow must believe it, for it seems so prime and good;"
8749,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And she told me if I loved you, I should see yer when I die,"
8750,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In the bright and happy heaven that is up beyond the sky.
8751,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8752,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Lord, I'm only just a cripple, and I'm no use here below,"
8753,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For I heard my mother whisper, she'd be glad if I could go;"
8754,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I'm cold and hungry sometimes; and I feel so lonely, too,"
8755,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Can't yer take me, gentle Jesus, up to heaven along o' you?"
8756,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8757,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Oh! I'd be so good and patient, and I'd never cry or fret,"
8758,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And your kindness to me, Jesus, I would surely not forget;"
8759,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I would love you all I know of, and would never make a noise--"
8760,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Can't you find me just a corner, where I'll watch the other boys?"
8761,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8762,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Oh! I think yer'll do it, Jesus, something seems to tell me so,"
8763,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For I feel so glad and happy, and I do so want to go,"
8764,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How I long to see yer, Jesus, and the children all so bright!"
8765,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Come and fetch me, won't yer, Jesus? Come and fetch me home tonight!"""
8766,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8767,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tommy ceased his supplication, he had told his soul's desire,"
8768,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And he waited for the answer till his head began to tire;
8769,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then he turned towards his corner and lay huddled in a heap,"
8770,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Closed his little eyes so gently, and was quickly fast asleep."
8771,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8772,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Oh, I wish that every scoffer could have seen his little face"
8773,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As he lay there in the corner, in that damp, and noisome place;"
8774,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For his countenance was shining like an angel's, fair and bright,"
8775,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And it seemed to fill the cellar with a holy, heavenly light."
8776,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8777,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He had only heard of Jesus from a ragged singing girl,"
8778,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He might well have wondered, pondered, till his brain began to whirl;"
8779,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But he took it as she told it, and believed it then and there,"
8780,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Simply trusting in the Saviour, and his kind and tender care."
8781,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8782,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In the morning, when the mother came to wake her crippled boy,"
8783,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She discovered that his features wore a look of sweetest joy,"
8784,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And she shook him somewhat roughly, but the cripple's face was cold--"
8785,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He had gone to join the children in the streets of shining gold.
8786,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8787,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tommy's prayer had soon been answered, and the Angel Death had come"
8788,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To remove him from his cellar, to his bright and heavenly home"
8789,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where sweet comfort, joy, and gladness never can decrease or end,"
8790,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And where Jesus reigns eternally, his Sovereign and his Friend."

8798,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8799,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8800,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was a bright and lovely summer's morn,"
8801,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Fair bloomed the flowers, the birds sang softly sweet,"
8802,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The air was redolent with perfumed balm,"
8803,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And Nature scattered, with unsparing hand,"
8804,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Her loveliest graces over hill and dale.
8805,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"An artist, weary of his narrow room"
8806,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Within the city's pent and heated walls,"
8807,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Had wandered long amid the ripening fields,"
8808,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Until, remembering his neglected themes,"
8809,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He thought to turn his truant steps toward home.
8810,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"These led him through a rustic, winding lane,"
8811,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lined with green hedge-rows spangled close with flowers,"
8812,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And overarched by trees of noblest growth.
8813,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But when at last he reached the farther end
8814,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of this sweet labyrinth, he there beheld"
8815,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A vision of such pure, pathetic grace,"
8816,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That weariness and haste were both obscured,"
8817,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It was a child--a young and lovely child
8818,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With eyes of heavenly hue, bright golden hair,"
8819,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And dimpled hands clasped in a morning prayer,"
8820,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Kneeling beside its youthful mother's knee.
8821,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Upon that baby brow of spotless snow,"
8822,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No single trace of guilt, or pain, or woe,"
8823,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No line of bitter grief or dark despair,"
8824,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of envy, hatred, malice, worldly care,"
8825,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Had ever yet been written. With bated breath,"
8826,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And hand uplifted as in warning, swift,"
8827,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The artist seized his pencil, and there traced"
8828,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In soft and tender lines that image fair:
8829,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then, when 'twas finished, wrote beneath one word,"
8830,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A word of holiest import--Innocence.
8831,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8832,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Years fled and brought with them a subtle change,"
8833,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Scattering Time's snow upon the artist's brow,"
8834,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But leaving there the laurel wreath of fame,"
8835,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,While all men spake in words of praise his name;
8836,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For he had traced full many a noble work
8837,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Upon the canvas that had touched men's souls,"
8838,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And drawn them from the baser things of earth,"
8839,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Toward the light and purity of heaven.
8840,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"One day, in tossing o'er his folio's leaves,"
8841,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He chanced upon the picture of the child,"
8842,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Which he had sketched that bright morn long before,"
8843,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And then forgotten. Now, as he paused to gaze,"
8844,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A ray of inspiration seemed to dart
8845,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Straight from those eyes to his. He took the sketch,"
8846,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Placed it before his easel, and with care"
8847,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That seemed but pleasure, painted a fair theme,"
8848,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Touching and still re-touching each bright lineament,"
8849,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Until all seemed to glow with life divine--
8850,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,'Twas innocence personified. But still
8851,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The artist could not pause. He needs must have
8852,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A meet companion for his fairest theme;
8853,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so he sought the wretched haunts of sin,"
8854,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Through miry courts of misery and guilt,"
8855,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Seeking a face which at the last was found.
8856,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Within a prison cell there crouched a man--
8857,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Nay, rather say a fiend--with countenance seamed"
8858,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And marred by all the horrid lines of sin;
8859,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Each mark of degradation might be traced,"
8860,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And every scene of horror he had known,"
8861,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And every wicked deed that he had done,"
8862,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Were visibly written on his lineaments;
8863,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Even the last, worst deed of all, that left him here,"
8864,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A parricide within a murderer's cell.
8865,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8866,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Here then the artist found him; and with hand
8867,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Made skillful by its oft-repeated toil,"
8868,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Transferred unto his canvas that vile face,"
8869,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And also wrote beneath it just one word,"
8870,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A word of darkest import--it was Vice.
8871,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then with some inspiration not his own,"
8872,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thinking, perchance, to touch that guilty heart,"
8873,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And wake it to repentance e'er too late,"
8874,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The artist told the tale of that bright morn,"
8875,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Placed the two pictured faces side by side,"
8876,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And brought the wretch before them. With a shriek
8877,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That echoed through those vaulted corridors,"
8878,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Like to the cries that issue from the lips
8879,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of souls forever doomed to woe,"
8880,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Prostrate upon the stony floor he fell,"
8881,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And hid his face and groaned aloud in anguish.
8882,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""I was that child once--I, yes, even I--"
8883,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In the gracious years forever fled,"
8884,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That innocent and happy little child!
8885,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"These very hands were raised to God in prayer,"
8886,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That now are reddened with a mother's blood.
8887,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Great Heaven! can such things be? Almighty power,"
8888,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Send forth Thy dart and strike me where I lie!"""
8889,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8890,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He rose, laid hold upon the artist's arm"
8891,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And grasped it with demoniac power,"
8892,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The while he cried: ""Go forth, I say, go forth"
8893,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And tell my history to the tempted youth.
8894,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I looked upon the wine when it was red,"
8895,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I heeded not my mother's piteous prayers,"
8896,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I heeded not the warnings of my friends,"
8897,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But tasted of the wine when it was red,"
8898,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Until it left a demon in my heart
8899,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That led me onward, step by step, to this,"
8900,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,This horrible place from which my body goes
8901,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Unto the gallows, and my soul to hell!"""
8902,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He ceased as last. The artist turned and fled;
8903,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But even as he went, unto his ears"
8904,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Were borne the awful echoes of despair,"
8905,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Which the lost wretch flung on the empty air,"
8906,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Cursing the demon that had brought him there.

8916,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8917,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not the sinner and saint, for it's well understood,"
8918,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The good are half bad and the bad are half good.
8919,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8920,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not the rich and the poor, for to rate a man's wealth,"
8921,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,You must first know the state of his conscience and health.
8922,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8923,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not the humble and proud, for in life's little span,"
8924,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Who puts on vain airs is not counted a man.
8925,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8926,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not the happy and sad, for the swift flying years"
8927,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Bring each man his laughter and each man his tears.
8928,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8929,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No; the two kinds of people on earth I mean,"
8930,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Are the people who lift and the people who lean.
8931,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8932,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wherever you go, you will find the earth's masses"
8933,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Are always divided in just these two classes.
8934,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8935,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And, oddly enough, you will find, too, I ween,"
8936,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,There's only one lifter to twenty who lean.
8937,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8938,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In which class are you? Are you easing the load
8939,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of overtaxed lifters, who toil down the road?"
8940,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
8941,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Or are you a leaner, who lets others share"

8997,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Tho' the spirit that first taught me has winged its flight above.
8998,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Yet, with no legacy but this, she has left me wealth untold,"
8999,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Yea, mightier than earth's riches, or the wealth of Ophir's gold."

9001,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When a child, I've kneeled beside her, in our dear old cottage home,"

9004,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"God's word fell from her trembling lips, like a presence felt and seen."
9005,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9006,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Solemn and sweet the counsels that spring from its open page,"

9015,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9016,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I can list that good man yonder, in the gray church by the brook,"
9017,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Take up that marvelous tale of love, of the story and the Book,"
9018,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How through the twilight glimmer, from the earliest dawn of time,"
9019,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was handed down as an heirloom, in almost every clime."
9020,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9021,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,How through strong persecution and the struggle of evil days

9023,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,blaze.
9024,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How in far-off lands, where the cypress bends o'er the laurel bough,"

9029,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Though steel and fire and lash swept on, and the cruel wave lapt the stake;"
9030,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How dungeon doors and prison bars had never damped the flame,"
9031,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But raised up converts to the creed whence Christian comfort came.
9032,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,

9054,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,This poem was read by Edwin Markham at the dedication of the Lincoln
9055,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Memorial at Washington, D.C., May 30, 1922. Before reading, he said: ""No"

9062,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9063,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9064,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,When the Norn Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour
9065,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,"
9066,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She left the Heaven of Heroes and came down
9067,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To make a man to meet the mortal need,"
9068,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She took the tried clay of the common road--
9069,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,"
9070,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Dasht through it all a strain of prophecy;
9071,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Tempered the heap with thrill of human tears;
9072,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then mixt a laughter with the serious stuff.
9073,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Into the shape she breathed a flame to light
9074,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That tender, tragic, ever-changing face;"
9075,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And laid on him a sense of the Mystic Powers,"
9076,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Moving--all husht--behind the mortal veil.
9077,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Here was a man to hold against the world,"
9078,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A man to match the mountains and the sea.
9079,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9080,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The color of the ground was in him, the red earth;"
9081,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The smack and tang of elemental things;
9082,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The rectitude and patience of the cliff;
9083,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The good-will of the rain that loves all leaves;
9084,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The friendly welcome of the wayside well;
9085,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The courage of the bird that dares the sea;
9086,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;
9087,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The pity of the snow that hides all scars;
9088,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The secrecy of streams that make their way
9089,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Under the mountain to the rifted rock;
9090,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The tolerance and equity of light
9091,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That gives as freely to the shrinking flower
9092,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As to the great oak flaring to the wind--
9093,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To the grave's low hill as to the Matterhorn
9094,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That shoulders out the sky. Sprung from the West,"
9095,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He drank the valorous youth of a new world.
9096,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The strength of virgin forests braced his mind,"
9097,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul.
9098,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,His words were oaks in acorns; and his thoughts
9099,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Were roots that firmly gript the granite truth.
9100,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9101,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Up from log cabin to the Capitol,"
9102,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"One fire was on his spirit, one resolve--"
9103,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To send the keen ax to the root of wrong,"
9104,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Clearing a free way for the feet of God,"
9105,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The eyes of conscience testing every stroke,"
9106,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To make his deed the measure of a man.
9107,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He built the rail-pile as he built the State,"
9108,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Pouring his splendid strength through every blow;
9109,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The grip that swung the ax in Illinois
9110,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Was on the pen that set a people free.
9111,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9112,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So came the Captain with the mighty heart;
9113,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when the judgment thunders split the house,"
9114,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wrenching the rafters from their ancient rest,"
9115,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He held the ridgepole up, and spikt again"
9116,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The rafters of the Home. He held his place--
9117,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Held the long purpose like a growing tree--
9118,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.
9119,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down"
9120,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As when a lordly cedar, green with boughs,"
9121,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,"
9122,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.

9150,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And hearts have broken

9170,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,How Salvator Won
9171,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9172,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9173,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The gate was thrown open, I rode out alone,"
9174,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"More proud than a monarch, who sits on a throne."
9175,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I am but a jockey, but shout upon shout"
9176,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Went up from the people who watched me ride out.
9177,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd
9178,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Were as earnest as those to which monarch e'er bowed.
9179,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain,"
9180,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As I patted my Salvator's soft, silken mane;"
9181,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand
9182,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As we passed by the multitude down to the stand.
9183,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The great wave of cheering came billowing back
9184,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As the hoofs of brave Tenny ran swift down the track,"
9185,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he stood there beside us, all bone and all muscle,"
9186,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Our noble opponent, well trained for the tussle"
9187,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That waited us there on the smooth, shining course."
9188,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My Salvator, fair to the lovers of horse"
9189,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As a beautiful woman is fair to man's sight--
9190,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Pure type of the thoroughbred, clean-limbed and bright--"
9191,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Stood taking the plaudits as only his due
9192,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And nothing at all unexpected or new.
9193,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9194,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And then there before us as the bright flag is spread,"
9195,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's a roar from the grand stand, and Tenny's ahead;"
9196,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"At the sound of the voices that shouted, ""A go!"""
9197,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow.
9198,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I tighten the reins on Prince Charlie's great son;
9199,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He is off like a rocket, the race is begun."
9200,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Half-way down the furlong their heads are together,"
9201,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Scarce room 'twixt their noses to wedge in a feather;
9202,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Past grand stand, and judges, in neck-to-neck strife,"
9203,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Ah, Salvator, boy, 'tis the race of your life!"
9204,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I press my knees closer, I coax him, I urge,"
9205,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I feel him go out with a leap and a surge;
9206,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I see him creep on, inch by inch, stride by stride,"
9207,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"While backward, still backward, falls Tenny beside."
9208,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We are nearing the turn, the first quarter is passed--"
9209,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,'Twixt leader and chaser the daylight is cast;
9210,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The distance elongates; still Tenny sweeps on,"
9211,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As graceful and free-limbed and swift as a fawn,"
9212,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"His awkwardness vanished, his muscles all strained--"
9213,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A noble opponent well born and well trained.
9214,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9215,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I glanced o'er my shoulder; ha! Tenny! the cost
9216,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of that one second's flagging will be--the race lost;
9217,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"One second's yielding of courage and strength,"
9218,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the daylight between us has doubled its length.
9219,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The first mile is covered, the race is mine--no!"
9220,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For the blue blood of Tenny responds to a blow;
9221,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He shoots through the air like a ball from a gun,"
9222,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the two lengths between us are shortened to one.
9223,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My heart is contracted, my throat feels a lump,"
9224,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For Tenny's long neck is at Salvator's rump;
9225,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And now with new courage grown bolder and bolder,"
9226,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I see him once more running shoulder to shoulder.
9227,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With knees, hands and body I press my grand steed;"
9228,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I urge him, I coax him, I pray him to heed!"
9229,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"O Salvator! Salvator! List to my calls,"
9230,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls.
9231,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm,"
9232,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As close to the saddle leaps Tenny's great form;
9233,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"One mighty plunge, and with knee, limb and hand,"
9234,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I lift my horse first by a nose past the stand.
9235,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We are under the string now--the great race is done--
9236,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And Salvator, Salvator, Salvator won!"
9237,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9238,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Cheer, hoary-headed patriarchs; cheer loud, I say;"
9239,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,'Tis the race of a century witnessed to-day!
9240,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Though ye live twice the space that's allotted to men
9241,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Ye never will see such a grand race again.
9242,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Let the shouts of the populace roar like the surf,"
9243,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For Salvator, Salvator, king of the turf,"
9244,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He has rivaled the record of thirteen long years;
9245,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He has won the first place in the vast line of peers.
9246,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"'Twas a neck-to-neck contest, a grand, honest race,"
9247,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And even his enemies grant him his place.
9248,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Down into the dust let old records be hurled,"
9249,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And hang out 2:05 to the gaze of the world!

9431,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It's only a tale of a lifeboat, of the dying and the dead,"
9432,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of the terrible storm and shipwreck that happened off Mumbles Head!
9433,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Maybe you have traveled in Wales, sir, and know it north and south;"
9434,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Maybe you are friends with the ""natives"" that dwell at Oystermouth;"
9435,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It happens, no doubt, that from Bristol you've crossed in a casual way,"

9438,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Well! it isn't like that in the winter, when the lighthouse stands alone,"
9439,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In the teeth of Atlantic breakers that foam on its face of stone;
9440,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It wasn't like that when the hurricane blew, and the storm-bell tolled,"
9441,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,or when
9442,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There was news of a wreck, and the lifeboat launched, and a desperate cry"
9443,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,for men.
9444,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,When in the world did the coxswain shirk? a brave old salt was he!
9445,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Proud to the bone of as four strong lads as ever had tasted the sea,"
9446,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Welshmen all to the lungs and loins, who, about that coast, 'twas said,"
9447,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Had saved some hundred lives apiece--at a shilling or so a head!
9448,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9449,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So the father launched the lifeboat, in the teeth of the tempest's roar,"
9450,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he stood like a man at the rudder, with an eye on his boys at the oar,"
9451,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Out to the wreck went the father! out to the wreck went the sons!
9452,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Leaving the weeping of women, and booming of signal guns;"
9453,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Leaving the mother who loved them, and the girls that the sailors love;"
9454,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Going to death for duty, and trusting to God above!"
9455,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Do you murmur a prayer, my brothers, when cozy and safe in bed,"
9456,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For men like these, who are ready to die for a wreck off Mumbles Head?"
9457,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It didn't go well with the lifeboat! 'twas a terrible storm that blew!
9458,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And it snapped the' rope in a second that was flung to the drowning crew;
9459,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9460,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And then the anchor parted--'twas a tussle to keep afloat!
9461,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But the father stuck to the rudder, and the boys to the brave old boat."
9462,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then at last on the poor doomed lifeboat a wave broke mountains high!
9463,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""God help us now!"" said the father. ""It's over, my lads! Good-bye""!"
9464,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Half of the crew swam shoreward, half to the sheltered caves,"
9465,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But father and sons were fighting death in the foam of the angry waves.
9466,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9467,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Up at a lighthouse window two women beheld the storm,"
9468,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And saw in the boiling breakers a figure--a fighting form;
9469,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It might be a gray-haired father, then the women held their breath;"
9470,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It might be a fair-haired brother, who was having a round with death;"
9471,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It might be a lover, a husband, whose kisses were on the lips"
9472,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of the women whose love is the life of men going down to the sea in ships.
9473,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"They had seen the launch of the lifeboat, they had seen the worst, and"
9474,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"more,"
9475,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then, kissing each other, these women went down from the lighthouse,"
9476,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,straight to shore.
9477,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9478,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There by the rocks on the breakers these sisters, hand in hand,"
9479,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Beheld once more that desperate man who struggled to reach the land,"
9480,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"'Twas only aid he wanted to help him across the wave,"
9481,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But what are a couple of women with only a man to save?
9482,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"What are a couple of women? well, more than three craven men"
9483,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Who stood by the shore with chattering teeth, refusing to stir--and then"
9484,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Off went the women's shawls, sir; in a second they're torn and rent,"
9485,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then knotting them into a rope of love, straight into the sea they went!"
9486,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9487,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Come back!"" cried the lighthouse-keeper. ""For God's sake, girls, come"
9488,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"back!"""
9489,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As they caught the waves on their foreheads, resisting the fierce attack."
9490,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Come back!"" moaned the gray-haired mother, as she stood by the angry sea,"
9491,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""If the waves take you, my darlings, there's nobody left to me!"""
9492,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9493,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Come back!"" said the three strong soldiers, who still stood faint and"

9500,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Give one more knot to the shawls, Bess! give one strong clutch of your"

9503,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wait for the next wave, darling! only a minute more,"
9504,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I'll have him safe in my arms, dear, and we'll drag him to the shore."""
9505,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Up to the arms in the water, fighting it breast to breast,"
9506,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They caught and saved a brother alive. God bless them! you know the rest--

9736,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That ""our God"" unsealed a fountain his whole life had never known,"

9742,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9743,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then she glided from his vision, left him prostrate on the ground"

9771,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Till bursts aloud a sobbing wail. The ladder falls with crashing sound--
9772,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A flaming, treacherous mass. O God! she was so young and he so brave!"
9773,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Look once again. See! see! on highest roof he stands--the fiery wave
9774,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Fierce rolling round--his arms enclasp the child--God help him yet to save!
9775,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""For life or for eternal sleep,"""
9776,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He cries, then makes a vaulting leap,"
9777,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A tree branch catches, with sure aim,"
9778,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And by the act proclaims his name;
9779,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The air was rent, the cheers rang loud,"
9780,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A rough voice cried from out the crowd,"

9788,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then hushed all murmurs through the throng.
9789,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,With reverent hands they bore him where
9790,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The summer evening's cooling air
9791,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Came softly sighing through the trees;

9793,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Forgiveness sought of God and Jim,"
9794,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Which dying lips accorded him.
9795,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A mark of whip on white face stirred
9796,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To gleaming scarlet at his words.

9938,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9939,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Once, when the good Saint Peter"
9940,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lived in the world below,"
9941,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And walked about it, preaching,"
9942,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Just as he did, you know;"
9943,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9944,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He came to the door of a cottage,"
9945,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In traveling round the earth,"
9946,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Where a little woman was making cakes,"
9947,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And baking them on the hearth;
9948,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9949,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And being faint with fasting,"
9950,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For the day was almost done,"
9951,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He asked her, from her store of cakes,"
9952,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To give him a single one.
9953,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9954,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So she made a very little cake,"
9955,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But as it baking lay,"
9956,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She looked at it, and thought it seemed"
9957,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Too large to give away.
9958,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9959,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Therefore she kneaded another,"
9960,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And still a smaller one;
9961,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But it looked, when she turned it over,"
9962,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As large as the first had done.
9963,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9964,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,"
9965,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And rolled, and rolled it flat;"
9966,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And baked it thin as a wafer--
9967,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But she couldn't part with that.
9968,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9969,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For she said, ""My cakes that seem too small"
9970,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When I eat of them myself,"

9972,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So she put them on the shelf.
9973,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
9974,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then good Saint Peter grew angry,"
9975,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For he was hungry and faint;
9976,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And surely such a woman
9977,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Was enough to provoke a saint.
9978,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,

10360,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Your dole of scanty words had been
10361,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But one more pang to bear
10362,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For him who kissed unto the last
10363,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Your tress of golden hair;
10364,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I did not put it where he said,"
10365,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For when the angels come,"
10366,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I would not have them find the sign
10367,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of falsehood in the tomb.
10368,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
10369,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I've read your letter, and I know"
10370,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The wiles that you have wrought
10371,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To win that trusting heart of his,"
10372,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And gained it--cruel thought!
10373,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,What lavish wealth men sometimes give
10374,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For what is worthless all!

10377,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
10378,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You shall not pity him, for now"
10379,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,His sorrow has an end;
10380,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Yet would that you could stand with me
10381,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Beside my fallen friend!

10389,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Within the prison dead-house, where"
10390,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Few mourners come to weep.
10391,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A rude plank coffin holds his form;
10392,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Yet death exalts his face,"
10393,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And I would rather see him thus
10394,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Than clasped in your embrace.
10395,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
10396,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To-night your home may shine with light
10397,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And ring with merry song,"
10398,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And you be smiling as your soul
10399,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Had done no deadly wrong;
10400,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Your hand so fair that none would think
10401,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It penned these words of pain;
10402,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Your skin so white--would God your heart
10403,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Were half as free from stain.
10404,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
10405,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I'd rather be my comrade dead
10406,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Than you in life supreme;
10407,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For yours the sinner's waking dread,"
10408,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And his the martyr's dream!
10409,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Whom serve we in this life we serve
10410,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In that which is to come;
10411,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He chose his way, you--yours; let God"

10468,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lord! how the ponds and rivers boiled,"

12131,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And very sorry am I, John,"
12132,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To see you go away.
12133,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You've labored late and early, John,"
12134,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And done the best you could;

12158,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's more in being honest, John,"

12233,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"King Alphonso of Asturias had imprisoned the Count Saldana, about the"
12234,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,time of the birth of the Count's son Bernardo. In an effort to secure
12235,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"his father's release, Bernardo, when old enough, took up arms. Finally"
12236,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"the King offered Bernardo possession of his father's person, in exchange"
12237,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,for the Castle of Carpio and all the King's subjects there imprisoned.
12238,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The cruel trick played by the King on Bernardo is here described.

12240,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12241,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire,"
12242,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned sire;

12248,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed,"
12249,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed."
12250,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glittering band,"
12251,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With one that midst them stately rode, as leader in the land:"
12252,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, is he,"
12253,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long to see."""
12254,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12255,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"His dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's hue came and"
12256,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,went;
12257,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there, dismounting, bent;"
12258,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he took--"
12259,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook?
12260,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That hand was cold,--a frozen thing,--it dropped from his like lead!"
12261,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He looked up to the face above,--the face was of the dead!"
12262,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A plume waved o'er the noble brow,--the brow was fixed and white,"
12263,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He met, at last, his father's eyes, but in them was no sight!"
12264,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12265,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Up from the ground he sprang and gazed, but who could paint that gaze?"
12266,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They hushed their very hearts that saw its horror and amaze.
12267,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"They might have chained him, as before that stony form he stood,"
12268,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood."
12269,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Father!"" at length he murmured low, and wept like childhood then;"

12273,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down."
12274,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow:

12282,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12283,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then, starting from the ground once more, he seized the monarch's rein,"
12284,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Amidst the pale and 'wildered looks of all the courtier train;
12285,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And, with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led,"
12286,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And sternly set them face to face, the king before the dead:"
12287,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Came I not forth, upon thy pledge, my father's hand to kiss?"

12289,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The voice, the glance, the heart I sought--give answer, where are they?"
12290,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"If thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life through this cold clay!"
12291,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Into these glassy eyes put light; be still! keep down thine ire;
12292,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Bid these white lips a blessing speak, this earth is not my sire."
12293,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was shed!"
12294,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thou canst not?--and a king!--his dust be mountains on thy head."""
12295,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12296,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He loosed the steed--his slack hand fell; upon the silent face
12297,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from that sad place."
12298,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"His hope was crushed, his after fate untold in martial strain;"

12463,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And waft its homage to Thy Deity.

12794,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"These Fortunate Isles, they are not far;"
12795,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They lie within reach of the lowliest door;
12796,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,You can see them gleam by the twilight star;
12797,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You can hear them sing by the moon's white shore,"
12798,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Nay, never look back! Those leveled gravestones,"
12799,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They were landing steps; they were steps unto thrones
12800,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of glory for souls that have sailed before
12801,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And have set white feet on the fortunate shore.
12802,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12803,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And what are the names of the Fortunate Isles?
12804,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Why, Duty and Love and a large content."
12805,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Lo! there are the isles of the watery miles
12806,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That God let down from the firmament;
12807,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lo! Duty and Love, and a true man's trust;"
12808,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Your forehead to God and your feet in the dust;
12809,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lo! Duty and Love, and a sweet babe's smiles,"
12810,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And there, O friend, are the Fortunate Isles."

12817,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,What the Choir Sang About the New Bonnet
12818,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12819,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12820,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A foolish little maiden bought a foolish little bonnet,"
12821,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With a ribbon, and a feather, and a bit of lace upon it;"
12822,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And that the other maidens of the little town might know it,"
12823,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She thought she'd go to meeting the next Sunday just to show it.
12824,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12825,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But though the little bonnet was scarce larger than a dime,"
12826,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The getting of it settled proved to be a work of time;
12827,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So when 'twas fairly tied, all the bells had stopped their ringing,"
12828,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when she came to meeting, sure enough the folks were singing."
12829,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12830,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So this foolish little maiden stood and waited at the door;
12831,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And she shook her ruffles out behind and smoothed them down before.
12832,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Hallelujah! hallelujah!"" sang the choir above her head."
12833,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Hardly knew you! hardly knew you!"" were the words she thought they said."
12834,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12835,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"This made the little maiden feel so very, very cross,"
12836,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That she gave her little mouth a twist, her little head a toss;"
12837,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For she thought the very hymn they sang was all about her bonnet,"
12838,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With the ribbon, and the feather, and the bit of lace upon it."
12839,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12840,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And she would not wait to listen to the sermon or the prayer,"
12841,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But pattered down the silent street, and hurried up the stair,"
12842,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Till she reached her little bureau, and in a band-box on it,"
12843,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Had hidden, safe from critics' eyes, her foolish little bonnet."
12844,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12845,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Which proves, my little maidens, that each of you will find"
12846,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In every Sabbath service but an echo of your mind;
12847,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the silly little head, that's filled with silly little airs,"
12848,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Will never get a blessing from sermon or from prayers.

12871,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12872,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12873,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I was strolling one day down the Lawther Arcade,"
12874,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That place for children's toys,"
12875,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Where you can purchase a dolly or spade
12876,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For your good little girls and boys.
12877,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And as I passed a certain stall, said a wee little voice to me:"
12878,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"O, I am a Colonel in a little cocked hat, and I ride on a tin Gee Gee;"
12879,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"O, I am a Colonel in a little cocked hat, and I ride on a tin Gee Gee."
12880,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12881,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then I looked and a little tin soldier I saw,"
12882,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In his little cocked hat so fine.
12883,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He'd a little tin sword that shone in the light
12884,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As he led a glittering line of tin hussars,"
12885,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Whose sabers flashed in a manner à la military.
12886,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And that little tin soldier he rode at their head,"
12887,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So proud on his tin Gee Gee.
12888,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12889,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then that little tin soldier he sobbed and he sighed,"
12890,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,So I patted his little tin head.
12891,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"What vexes your little tin soul? said I,"
12892,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And this is what he said:
12893,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I've been on this stall a very long time,"
12894,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I'm marked twenty-nine, as you see;"
12895,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Whilst just on the shelf above my head,"
12896,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,There's a fellow marked sixty-three.
12897,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12898,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Now he hasn't got a sword and he hasn't got a horse,"
12899,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And I'm quite as good as he.
12900,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So why mark me at twenty-nine,"
12901,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And him at sixty-three?
12902,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"There's a pretty little dolly girl over there,"
12903,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And I'm madly in love with she.
12904,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But now that I'm only marked twenty-nine,"
12905,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She turns up her nose at me,"
12906,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She turns up her little wax nose at me,"
12907,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And carries on with sixty-three.
12908,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12909,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And, oh, she's dressed in a beautiful dress;"
12910,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It's a dress I do admire,"
12911,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She has pearly blue eyes that open and shut
12912,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When worked inside by a wire,"
12913,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And once on a time when the folks had gone,"
12914,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She used to ogle at me.
12915,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But now that I'm only marked twenty-nine,"
12916,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,She turns up her nose at me.
12917,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"She turns up her little snub nose at me,"
12918,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And carries on with sixty-three.
12919,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12920,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Cheer up, my little tin man, said I,"
12921,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I'll see what I can do.
12922,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You're a fine little fellow, and it's a shame"
12923,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That she should so treat you.
12924,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"So I took down the label from the shelf above,"
12925,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I labeled him sixty-three,"
12926,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I marked the other one twenty-nine,"
12927,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Which was _very, very_ wrong of me,"
12928,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I felt so sorry for that little tin soul,"
12929,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As he rode on his tin Gee Gee.
12930,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
12931,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Now that little tin soldier he puffed with pride,"
12932,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"At being marked sixty-three,"
12933,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And that saucy little dolly girl smiled once more,"
12934,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For he'd risen in life, do you see?"
12935,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And it's so in this world; for I'm in love
12936,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,With a maiden of high degree;
12937,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I am only marked twenty-nine,"
12938,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the other chap's sixty-three--
12939,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And a girl never looks at twenty-nine
12940,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,With a possible sixty-three!

13131,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That great God himself is weaving,--"
13132,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Bringing out the world's dark mystery,"
13133,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In the light of truth and history;
13134,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And as web and woof diminish,"
13135,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Comes the grand and glorious finish;

13143,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13144,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13145,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"'Tis gone at last, and I am glad; it stayed a fearful while,"
13146,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when the world was light and gay, I could not even smile;"
13147,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It stood before me like a giant, outstretched its iron arm;"
13148,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No matter where I looked, I saw the mortgage on the farm."
13149,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13150,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'll tell you how it happened, for I want the world to know"
13151,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,How glad I am this winter day whilst earth is white with snow;
13152,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I'm just as happy as a lark. No cause for rude alarm
13153,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Confronts us now, for lifted is the mortgage on the farm."
13154,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13155,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The children they were growing up and they were smart and trim.
13156,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To some big college in the East we'd sent our youngest, Jim;"
13157,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And every time he wrote us, at the bottom of his screed"
13158,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He tacked some Latin fol-de-rol which none of us could read.
13159,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13160,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The girls they ran to music, and to painting, and to rhymes,"
13161,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They said the house was out of style and far behind the times;
13162,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,They suddenly diskivered that it didn't keep'm warm--
13163,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Another step of course towards a mortgage on the farm.
13164,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13165,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We took a cranky notion, Hannah Jane and me one day,"
13166,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"While we were coming home from town, a-talking all the way;"
13167,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The old house wasn't big enough for us, although for years"
13168,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Beneath its humble roof we'd shared each other's joys and tears.
13169,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13170,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We built it o'er and when 'twas done, I wish you could have seen it,"
13171,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It was a most tremendous thing--I really didn't mean it;
13172,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Why, it was big enough to hold the people of the town"
13173,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And not one half as cosy as the old one we pulled down.
13174,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13175,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I bought a fine pianner and it shortened still the pile,"
13176,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But, then, it pleased the children and they banged it all the while;"
13177,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No matter what they played for me, their music had no charm,"
13178,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For every tune said plainly: ""There's a mortgage on the farm!"""
13179,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13180,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I worked from morn till eve, and toiled as often toils the slave"
13181,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To meet that grisly interest; I tried hard to be brave,"
13182,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And oft when I came home at night with tired brain and arm,"
13183,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The chickens hung their heads, they felt the mortgage on the farm.--"
13184,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13185,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But we saved a penny now and then, we laid them in a row,"
13186,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The girls they played the same old tunes, and let the new ones go;"
13187,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when from college came our Jim with laurels on his brow,"
13188,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I led him to the stumpy field and put him to the plow.
13189,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13190,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He something said in Latin which I didn't understand,"
13191,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But it did me good to see his plow turn up the dewy land;
13192,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when the year had ended and empty were the cribs,"
13193,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We found we'd hit the mortgage, sir, a blow between the ribs."
13194,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13195,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To-day I harnessed up the team and thundered off to town,"
13196,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And in the lawyer's sight I planked the last bright dollar down;
13197,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And when I trotted up the lanes a-feeling good and warm,"
13198,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The old red rooster crowed his best: ""No mortgage on the farm!"""
13199,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13200,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'll sleep almighty good to-night, the best for many a day,"
13201,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The skeleton that haunted us has passed fore'er away.
13202,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The girls can play the brand-new tunes with no fears to alarm,"
13203,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And Jim can go to Congress, with no mortgage on the farm!"

13212,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That is what the vision said.
13213,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13214,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In his chamber all alone,"
13215,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Kneeling on the floor of stone,"
13216,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
13217,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For his sins of indecision,"
13218,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Prayed for greater self-denial
13219,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In temptation and in trial;
13220,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was noonday by the dial,"
13221,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the Monk was all alone.
13222,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13223,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Suddenly, as if it lightened,"
13224,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,An unwonted splendor brightened
13225,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,All within him and without him
13226,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In that narrow cell of stone;
13227,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And he saw the blessed vision
13228,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of our Lord, with light Elysian"
13229,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Like a vesture wrapped about Him,"
13230,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Like a garment round Him thrown.
13231,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13232,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Not as crucified and slain
13233,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not in agonies of pain,"
13234,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Not with bleeding hands and feet,"
13235,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Did the Monk his Master see;
13236,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But as in the village street,"
13237,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In the house or harvest field,"
13238,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Halt and lame and blind He healed,"
13239,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,When He walked in Galilee.
13240,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13241,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In as attitude imploring,"
13242,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Hands upon his bosom crossed,"
13243,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wondering, worshiping, adoring,"
13244,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Knelt the Monk, in rapture lost,"
13245,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,"
13246,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Who am I that thus Thou deignest
13247,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To reveal Thyself to me?
13248,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Who am I, that from the center"
13249,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of Thy glory Thou shouldst enter
13250,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"This poor cell, my guest to be?"
13251,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13252,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then amid his exaltation,"
13253,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Loud the convent bell appalling,"
13254,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"From its belfrey calling, calling,"
13255,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Rang through court and corridor
13256,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With persistent iteration,"
13257,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He had never heard before.
13258,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,It was now the appointed hour
13259,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When alike in shine or shower,"
13260,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Winter's cold or summer's heat,"
13261,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To the convent portals came
13262,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All the blind and halt and lame,"
13263,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All the beggars of the street,"
13264,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For their daily dole of food
13265,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Dealt them by the brotherhood;
13266,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13267,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And their almoner was he
13268,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Who upon his bended knees
13269,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Rapt in silent ecstasy
13270,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of divinest self-surrender,"
13271,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Saw the vision and the splendor.
13272,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13273,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Deep distress and hesitation
13274,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Mingled with his adoration;
13275,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Should he go, or should he stay?"
13276,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Should he leave the poor to wait
13277,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Hungry at the convent gate,"
13278,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Till the vision passed away?
13279,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Should he slight his radiant guest,"
13280,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Slight this visitant celestial
13281,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For a crowd of ragged, bestial"
13282,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Beggars at the convent gate?
13283,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Would the vision there remain?
13284,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Would the vision come again?
13285,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then a voice within his breast
13286,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Whispered audible and clear,"
13287,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As if to the outward ear:
13288,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Do thy duty; that is best;"
13289,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Leave unto thy Lord the rest!"""
13290,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13291,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Straightway to his feet he started,"
13292,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And with longing look intent
13293,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"On the blessed vision bent,"
13294,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Slowly from his cell departed,"
13295,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Slowly on his errand went.
13296,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13297,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"At the gate the poor were waiting,"
13298,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Looking through the iron grating,"
13299,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,With that terror in the eye
13300,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That is only seen in those
13301,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Who amid their wants and woes
13302,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Hear the sound of doors that close.
13303,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And of feet that pass them by:
13304,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Grown familiar with disfavor,"
13305,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Grown familiar with the savor
13306,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of the bread by which men die;
13307,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But to-day, they knew not why,"
13308,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Like the gate of Paradise
13309,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Seemed the convent gate to rise,"
13310,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Like a sacrament divine
13311,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Seemed to them the bread and wine.
13312,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In his heart the Monk was praying,"
13313,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thinking of the homeless poor,"
13314,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,What they suffer and endure;
13315,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"What we see not, what we see;"
13316,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the inward voice was saying:
13317,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Whatsoever thing thou doest"
13318,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To the least of mine and lowest,"
13319,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That thou doest unto me."""
13320,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13321,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Unto me! but had the vision
13322,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Come to him in beggar's clothing,"
13323,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Come a mendicant imploring,"
13324,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Would he then have knelt adoring,"
13325,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Or have listened with derision,"
13326,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And have turned away with loathing?
13327,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13328,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thus his conscience put the question,"
13329,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Full of troublesome suggestion,"
13330,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As at length, with hurried pace,"
13331,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Toward his cell he turned his face,"
13332,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And beheld the convent bright
13333,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With a supernatural light,"
13334,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Like a luminous cloud expanding
13335,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Over floor and wall and ceiling.
13336,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13337,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But he paused with awe-struck feeling
13338,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"At the threshold of his door,"
13339,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For the vision still was standing
13340,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As he left it there before,"
13341,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When the convent bell appalling,"
13342,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
13343,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Summoned him to feed the poor.
13344,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Through the long hour intervening
13345,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It had waited his return,"
13346,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he felt his bosom burn,"
13347,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Comprehending all the meaning,"
13348,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,When the blessed vision said:
13349,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled."""

13362,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Somebody's Darling was borne one day--
13363,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13364,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Somebody's Darling, so young and so brave,"
13365,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wearing yet on his pale, sweet face,"
13366,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Soon to be hid by the dust of the grave,"
13367,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The lingering light of his boyhood's grace.
13368,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,

13372,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Somebody's Darling is dying now.
13373,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13374,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Back from his beautiful blue-veined brow
13375,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Brush all the wandering waves of gold,"
13376,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Cross his hands on his bosom now--
13377,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Somebody's Darling is still and cold.
13378,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13379,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Kiss him once for somebody's sake,"
13380,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Murmur a prayer both soft and low;

13397,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Somebody clung to his parting hand.
13398,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13399,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Somebody's waiting and watching for him--
13400,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Yearning to hold him again to her heart;
13401,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And there he lies with his blue eyes dim,"
13402,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the smiling, child-like lips apart."
13403,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13404,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tenderly bury the fair young dead,"

13418,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And over on the wooded height we held their lines at bay.
13419,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,At last the muttering guns were still; the day died slow and wan;
13420,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"At last the gunners pipes did fill, the sergeant's yarns began."
13421,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When, as the wind a moment blew aside the fragrant flood"
13422,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Our brierwoods raised, within our view a little maiden stood."
13423,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A tiny tot of six or seven, from fireside fresh she seemed,"
13424,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,(Of such a little one in heaven one soldier often dreamed.)
13425,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And as we stared, her little hand went to her curly head"
13426,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In grave salute. ""And who are _you_?"" at length the sergeant said."
13427,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""And where's your home?"" he growled again. She lisped out, ""Who is me?"
13428,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Why, don't you know? I'm little Jane, the Pride of Battery B."
13429,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My home? Why, that was burned away, and pa and ma are dead;"
13430,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And so I ride the guns all day along with Sergeant Ned.
13431,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I've a drum that's not a toy, a cap with feathers, too;"
13432,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And I march beside the drummer boy on Sundays at review.
13433,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But now our 'bacca's all give out, the men can't have their smoke,"
13434,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so they're cross--why, even Ned won't play with me and joke."
13435,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And the big colonel said to-day--I hate to hear him swear--
13436,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He'd give a leg for a good pipe like the Yanks had over there.
13437,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so I thought when beat the drum,  and the big guns were still,"
13438,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I'd creep beneath the tent and come out here across the hill
13439,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And beg, good Mister Yankee men, you'd give me some 'Lone Jack.'"
13440,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Please do: when we get some again, I'll surely bring it back."
13441,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Indeed I will, for Ned--says he,--if I do what I say,"
13442,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'll be a general yet, maybe, and ride a prancing bay."""
13443,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13444,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,We brimmed her tiny apron o'er; you should have heard her laugh
13445,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As each man from his scanty store shook out a generous half.
13446,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To kiss the little mouth stooped down a score of grimy men,"
13447,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Until the sergeant's husky voice said,""'Tention squad!"" and then"
13448,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We gave her escort, till good-night the pretty waif we bid,"
13449,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And watched her toddle out of sight--or else 'twas tears that hid
13450,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Her tiny form--nor turned about a man, nor spoke a word,"
13451,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Till after awhile a far, hoarse shout upon the wind we heard!"
13452,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"We sent it back, then cast sad eyes upon the scene around;"

13468,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It was kept out in the kitchen, and 'twas long and deep and wide,"
13469,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the poker hung above it and the shovel stood beside,"
13470,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the big, black cookstove, grinnin' through its grate from ear to ear,"
13471,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Seemed to look as if it loved it like a brother, pretty near."
13472,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Flowered oilcloth tacked around it kept its cracks and knot-holes hid,"
13473,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And a pair of leather hinges fastened on the heavy lid,"
13474,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And it hadn't any bottom--or, at least, it seemed that way"
13475,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When you hurried in to fill it, so's to get outside and play."
13476,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13477,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When the noons was hot and lazy and the leaves hung dry and still,"
13478,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the locust in the pear tree started up his planin'-mill,"
13479,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the drum-beat of the breakers was a soothin', temptin' roll,"
13480,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And you knew the ""gang"" was waitin' by the brimmin' ""swimmin' hole""--"
13481,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Louder than the locust's buzzin,' louder than the breakers' roar,"
13482,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You could hear the wood-box holler, ""Come and fill me up once more!"""
13483,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the old clock ticked and chuckled as you let each armful drop,"
13484,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Like it said, ""Another minute, and you're nowheres near the top!"""
13485,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13486,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In the chilly winter mornin's when the bed was snug and warm,"
13487,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the frosted winders tinkled 'neath the fingers of the storm,"
13488,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And your breath rose off the piller in a smoky cloud of steam--
13489,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then that wood-box, grim and empty, came a-dancin' through your dream,"
13490,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Came and pounded at your conscience, screamed in aggravatin' glee,"
13491,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Would you like to sleep this mornin'? You git up and 'tend to me!"""
13492,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Land! how plain it is this minute--shed and barn and drifted snow,"
13493,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the slabs of oak a-waitin!, piled and ready, in a row."
13494,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13495,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Never was a fishin' frolic, never was a game of ball,"
13496,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But that mean, provokin' wood-box had to come and spoil it all;"
13497,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You might study at your lessons and 'twas full and full to stay,"
13498,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But jest start an Injun story, and 'twas empty right away."
13499,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Seemed as if a spite was in it, and although I might forgit"
13500,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All the other chores that plagued me, I can hate that wood-box yit:"
13501,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And when I look back at boyhood--shakin' off the cares of men--
13502,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Still it comes to spoil the picture, screamin', ""Fill me up again!"""

13506,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13507,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13508,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13509,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Inasmuch
13510,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13511,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13512,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Good Deacon Roland--""may his tribe increase!""--"
13513,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Awoke one Sabbath morn feeling at peace
13514,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"With God and all mankind. His wants supplied,"
13515,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He read his Bible and then knelt beside
13516,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The family altar, and uplifted there"
13517,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,His voice to God in fervent praise and prayer;
13518,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In praise for blessings past, so rich and free,"
13519,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And prayer for benedictions yet to be.
13520,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then on a stile, which spanned the dooryard fence,"
13521,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He sat him down complacently, and thence"
13522,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Surveyed with pride, o'er the far-reaching plain,"
13523,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,His flocks and herds and fields of golden grain;
13524,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"His meadows waving like the billowy seas,"
13525,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And orchards filled with over-laden trees,"
13526,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Quoth he: ""How vast the products of my lands;"
13527,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Abundance crowns the labor of my hands,"
13528,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Great is my substance; God indeed is good,"
13529,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Who doth in love provide my daily food."""
13530,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13531,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"While thus he sat in calm soliloquy,"
13532,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A voice aroused him from his reverie,--"
13533,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A childish voice from one whose shoeless feet
13534,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Brought him unnoticed to the deacon's seat;
13535,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Please mister, I have eaten naught to-day;"
13536,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,If I had money I would gladly pay
13537,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"For bread; but I am poor, and cannot buy"
13538,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"My breakfast; mister, would you mind if I"
13539,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Should ask for something, just for what you call"
13540,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Cold pieces from your table, that is all?"""
13541,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The deacon listened to the child's request,"
13542,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The while his penetrating eye did rest
13543,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"On him whose tatters, trembling, quick revealed"
13544,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The agitation of the heart concealed
13545,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Within the breast of one unskilled in ruse,"
13546,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Who asked not alms like one demanding dues.
13547,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then said the deacon: ""I am not inclined"
13548,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To give encouragement to those who find
13549,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It easier to beg for bread betimes,"
13550,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Than to expend their strength in earning dimes
13551,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Wherewith to purchase it. A parent ought
13552,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To furnish food for those whom he has brought
13553,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Into this world, where each one has his share"
13554,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of tribulation, sorrow, toil and care."
13555,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I sympathize with you, my little lad,"
13556,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Your destitution makes me feel so sad;
13557,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But, for the sake of those who should supply"
13558,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Your wants, I must your earnest plea deny;"
13559,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And inasmuch as giving food to you
13560,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Would be providing for your parents, too,"
13561,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thus fostering vagrancy and idleness,"
13562,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I cannot think such charity would bless
13563,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Who gives or takes; and therefore I repeat,"
13564,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I cannot give you anything to eat."""
13565,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Before this ""vasty deep"" of logic stood"
13566,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The child nor found it satisfying food.
13567,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Nor did he tell the tale he might have told
13568,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of parents slumbering in the grave's damp mould,"
13569,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But quickly shrank away to find relief
13570,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"In giving vent to his rekindled grief,"
13571,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,While Deacon Roland soon forgot the appeal
13572,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,In meditating on his better weal.
13573,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13574,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Ere long the Sabbath bells their peals rang out
13575,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To summon worshippers, with hearts devout,"
13576,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,To wait on God and listen to His word;
13577,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And then the deacon's pious heart was stirred;
13578,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And in the house of God he soon was found
13579,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Engaged in acts of worship most profound.
13580,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Wearied, however, with his week-day care,"
13581,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,He fell asleep before the parson's prayer
13582,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Was ended; then he dreamed he died and came
13583,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To heaven's grand portal, and announced his name:"
13584,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""I'm Deacon Roland, called from earth afar,"
13585,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To join the saints; please set the gates ajar,"
13586,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That I may 'join the everlasting song,'"
13587,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And mingle ever with the ransomed throng."""
13588,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then lo! ""a horror of great darkness"" came"
13589,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Upon him, as he heard a voice exclaim:"
13590,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Depart from me! you cannot enter here!"
13591,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I never knew you, for indeed, howe'er"
13592,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You may have wrought on earth, the sad, sad fact"
13593,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Remains, that life's sublimest, worthiest act--"""
13594,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The deacon woke to find it all a dream
13595,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Just as the minister announced his theme:
13596,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""My text,"" said he, ""doth comfort only such"
13597,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As practice charity; for 'inasmuch
13598,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,As ye have done it to the least of these
13599,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,My little ones' saith He who holds the keys
13600,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of heaven, 'ye have done it unto me,'"
13601,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I will give you immortality."""
13602,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13603,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Straightway the deacon left his cushioned pew,"
13604,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And from the church in sudden haste withdrew,"
13605,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And up the highway ran, on love's swift feet"
13606,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To overtake the child of woe, and greet"
13607,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Him as the worthy representative
13608,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of Christ the Lord and to him freely give
13609,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"All needful good, that thus he might atone"
13610,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For the neglect which he before had shown.
13611,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Thus journeying, God directed all his way,"
13612,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"O'er hill and dale, to where the outcast lay"
13613,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Beside the road bemoaning his sad fate.
13614,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And then the deacon said, ""My child, 'tis late;"
13615,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Make haste and journey with me to my home;
13616,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"To guide you thither, I myself have come;"
13617,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And you shall have the food you asked in vain,"
13618,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For God himself hath made my duty plain;
13619,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"If he demand it, all I have is thine;"
13620,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Shrink not, but trust me; place thy hand in mine."""
13621,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And as they journeyed toward the deacon's home,"
13622,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The child related how he came to roam,"
13623,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Until the listening deacon understood
13624,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The touching story of his orphanhood.
13625,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then, finding in the little waif a gem"
13626,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Worthy to deck the Saviour's diadem,"
13627,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"He drew him to his loving breast, and said,"
13628,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""My child, you shall by me be clothed and fed;"
13629,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Nor shall you go from hence again to roam
13630,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"While God in love provides for us a home."""
13631,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And as the weeks and months roll on apace,"
13632,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The deacon held the lad in love's embrace;
13633,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And being childless did on him confer
13634,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The boon of sonship.
13635,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13636,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Thus the almoner
13637,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of God's great bounty to the destitute
13638,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The deacon came to be; and as the fruit
13639,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Of having learned to keep the golden rule
13640,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,His charity became all-bountiful;
13641,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And from thenceforth he lived to benefit
13642,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Mankind; and when in life's great book were writ
13643,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Their names who heeded charity's request,"
13644,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Lo! Deacon Roland's ""name led all the rest."""

13650,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13651,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,No Sects in Heaven
13652,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13653,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13654,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Talking of sects quite late one eve,"
13655,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"What one and another of saints believe,"
13656,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That night I stood in a troubled dream
13657,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,By the side of a darkly-flowing stream.
13658,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13659,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And a ""churchman"" down to the river came,"
13660,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"When I heard a strange voice call his name,"
13661,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Good father, stop; when you cross this tide"
13662,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You must leave your robes on the other side."""
13663,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13664,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But the aged father did not mind,"
13665,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And his long gown floated out behind
13666,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As down to the stream his way he took,"
13667,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,His hands firm hold of a gilt-edged book.
13668,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13669,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""I'm bound for heaven, and when I'm there"
13670,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I shall want my book of Common Prayer,"
13671,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And though I put on a starry crown,"
13672,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I should feel quite lost without my gown."""
13673,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13674,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then he fixed his eye on the shining track,"
13675,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But his gown was heavy and held him back,"
13676,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the poor old father tried in vain,"
13677,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A single step in the flood to gain.
13678,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13679,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I saw him again on the other side,"
13680,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But his silk gown floated on the tide,"
13681,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And no one asked, in that blissful spot,"
13682,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"If he belonged to ""the church"" or not."
13683,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13684,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then down to the river a Quaker strayed;
13685,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"His dress of a sober hue was made,"
13686,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""My hat and coat must be all of gray,"
13687,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I cannot go any other way."""
13688,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13689,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin
13690,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And staidly, solemnly, waded in,"
13691,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight
13692,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Over his forehead, so cold and white."
13693,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13694,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But a strong wind carried away his hat,"
13695,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And he sighed a few moments over that,"
13696,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And then, as he gazed to the farther shore"
13697,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The coat slipped off and was seen no more.
13698,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13699,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Poor, dying Quaker, thy suit of gray"
13700,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Is quietly sailing--away--away,"
13701,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But thou'lt go to heaven, as straight as an arrow,"
13702,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Whether thy brim be broad or narrow.
13703,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13704,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Next came Dr. Watts with a bundle of psalms
13705,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Tied nicely up in his aged arms,"
13706,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And hymns as many, a very wise thing,"
13707,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That the people in heaven, ""all round,"" might sing."
13708,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13709,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh,"
13710,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As he saw that the river ran broad and high,"
13711,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And looked rather surprised, as one by one,"
13712,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,The psalms and hymns in the wave went down.
13713,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13714,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And after him, with his MSS.,"
13715,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Came Wesley, the pattern of godliness,"
13716,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But he cried, ""Dear me, what shall I do?"
13717,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The water has soaked them through and through."""
13718,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13719,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And there, on the river, far and wide,"
13720,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Away they went on the swollen tide,"
13721,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And the saint, astonished, passed through alone,"
13722,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Without his manuscripts, up to the throne."
13723,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13724,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then gravely walking, two saints by name,"
13725,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Down to the stream together came,"
13726,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But as they stopped at the river's brink,"
13727,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I saw one saint from the other shrink.
13728,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13729,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Sprinkled or plunged--may I ask you, friend,"
13730,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How you attained to life's great end?"""
13731,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""_Thus_, with a few drops on my brow"";"
13732,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""But I have been _dipped_, as you'll see me now."
13733,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13734,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""And I really think it will hardly do,"
13735,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"As I'm 'close communion,' to cross with you."
13736,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You're bound, I know, to the realms of bliss,"
13737,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But you must go that way, and I'll go this."""
13738,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13739,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And straightway plunging with all his might,"
13740,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Away to the left--his friend at the right,"
13741,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Apart they went from this world of sin,"
13742,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But how did the brethren ""enter in""?"
13743,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13744,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And now where the river was rolling on,"
13745,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A Presbyterian church went down;
13746,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Of women, there seemed an innumerable throng,"
13747,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But the men I could count as they passed along.
13748,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13749,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And concerning the road they could never agree,"
13750,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The _old_ or the _new_ way, which it could be;"
13751,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Nor ever a moment paused to think
13752,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,That both would lead to the river's brink.
13753,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13754,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And a sound of murmuring long and loud
13755,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Came ever up from the moving crowd,"
13756,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""You're in the old way, and I'm in the new,"
13757,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"That is the false, and this is the true"":"
13758,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Or, ""I'm in the old way, and you're in the new,"
13759,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"_That_ is the false, and _this_ is the true."""
13760,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13761,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But the brethren only seemed to speak,"
13762,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Modest the sisters walked, and meek,"
13763,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And if ever one of them chanced to say
13764,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"What troubles she met with on the way,"
13765,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"How she longed to pass to the other side,"
13766,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide,"
13767,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A voice arose from the brethren then,"
13768,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Let no one speak but the 'holy men,'"
13769,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,For have ye not heard the words of Paul?
13770,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"'Oh, let the women keep silence all.'"""
13771,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13772,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I watched them long in my curious dream.
13773,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Till they stood by the border of the stream,"
13774,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Then, just as I thought, the two ways met."
13775,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But all the brethren were talking yet,"
13776,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And would talk on, till the heaving tide"
13777,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Carried them over, side by side;"
13778,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Side by side, for the way was one,"
13779,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The toilsome journey of life was done,"
13780,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And priest and Quaker, and all who died,"
13781,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,Came out alike on the other side;
13782,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No forms or crosses, or books had they,"
13783,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No gowns of silk, or suits of gray,"
13784,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"No creeds to guide them, or MSS.,"

13795,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I can't tell much about the thing, 'twas done so powerful quick;"
13796,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But 'pears to me I got a most outlandish heavy lick:
13797,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It broke my leg, and tore my skulp, and jerked my arm 'most out."
13798,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,But take a seat: I'll try and tell jest how it kem about.
13799,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13800,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"You see, I'd started down to town, with that 'ere team of mine,"
13801,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"A-haulin' down a load o' corn to Ebenezer Kline,"
13802,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And drivin' slow; for, jest about a day or two before,"

13804,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13805,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,You know the railroad cuts across the road at Martin's Hole:
13806,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Well, thar I seed a great big sign, raised high upon a pole;"
13807,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I thought I'd stop and read the thing, and find out what it said,"
13808,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And so I stopped the hosses on the railroad-track, and read."
13809,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13810,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I ain't no scholar, rekollect, and so I had to spell,"
13811,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I started kinder cautious like, with R-A-I and L;"
13812,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And that spelt ""rail"" as clear as mud; R-O-A-D was ""road."""
13813,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I lumped 'em: ""railroad"" was the word, and that 'ere much I knowed."
13814,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13815,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"C-R-O and double S, with I-N-G to boot,"
13816,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"Made ""crossing"" jest as plain as Noah Webster dared to do't."
13817,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"""Railroad crossing""--good enough!--L double-O-K, ""look"";"
13818,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"And I wos lookin' all the time, and spellin' like a book."
13819,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13820,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"O-U-T spelt ""out"" just right; and there it was, ""look out,"""
13821,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I's kinder cur'us like, to know jest what't was all about;"
13822,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"F-O-R and T-H-E; 'twas then ""look out for the--"""
13823,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And then I tried the next word; it commenced with E-N-G.

13825,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"I'd got that fur, when suddintly there came an awful whack;"
13826,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,A thousand fiery thunderbolts just scooped me off the track;
13827,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"The hosses went to Davy Jones, the wagon went to smash,"
13828,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,And I was histed seven yards above the tallest ash.
13829,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,
13830,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,I didn't come to life ag'in fur 'bout a day or two;
13831,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"But, though I'm crippled up a heap, I sorter struggled through;"
13832,IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS,"It ain't the pain, nor 'taint the loss o' that 'ere team of mine;"

13847,I,'Twas April; nineteen-six the year; old San Francisco lay
13848,I,Effulgent in the splendor of the dying orb of day
13849,I,That bathed in flood of crimson light Mount Tamalpais' lonely height
13850,I,"And kissed the sister towns ""goodnight"" across the misty bay."
13851,I,
13852,I,"It burst in glory on the hills, lit up the princely homes,"
13853,I,And gleamed from lofty towers and spires and flashed from gilded domes;
13854,I,"It glorified the massive blocks caught in its widening flow,"
13855,I,"Engulfed the maze of streets and parks that stretched away below,"
13856,I,"Till marble white and foliage green and vales of gray, and silvery sheen"
13857,I,"Of ocean's surface vast, serene, were tinted by its glow."
13858,I,
13859,I,The tranquil murmurs of the deep were borne on balmy air
13860,I,All odorous with lily breath and roses sweet and rare.
13861,I,"The zephyrs sang a lullaby as the slow, fiery ball"
13862,I,Ended its trail of gorgeousness behind horizon's wall.
13863,I,Then gray absorbed each rainbow hue and dark the beauteous landscape grew
13864,I,As shadowy Evening softly drew her curtain over all.

13883,III,"The ground vibrates with sadden shock. The buildings tremble, groan"

13889,III,And massive structures thrill like giant oaks before the blast;
13890,III,Into the streets with deafening crash the frailer ones are cast.
13891,III,"Half garbed, the multitude rush out in frantic haste, with prayer and"
13892,III,"shout,"
13893,III,To join the panic stricken rout. Ho! DEATH is marching past.
13894,III,
13895,III,"A rumbling noise! The streets upheave, and sink again, like waves;"
13896,III,And shattered piles and shapeless wrecks are strewn with human graves.
13897,III,Danger at every corner lurks. Destruction fills the air.

13906,IV,
13907,IV,A hundred tiny tongues of flame forth from the ruins burst.
13908,IV,No water! God! what shall we do to slake their quenchless thirst?
13909,IV,"The shocks have broken all the mains! ""_Use wine!_"" the people cry."
13910,IV,"The red flames laugh like drunken fiends; they stagger as to die,"

13913,IV,
13914,IV,Ha! from the famed Presidio that guards the Golden Gate
13915,IV,Come Funston and his regulars to match their strength with Fate.
13916,IV,The soldiers and the citizens are fighting side by side
13917,IV,"To check that onslaught of red wrath, to stem destruction's tide."
13918,IV,"With roar, and boom, and blare, and blast, an open space is cleared at"
13919,IV,last.
13920,IV,The fiends of fury gallop past with flanks outstretched and wide;
13921,IV,
13922,IV,"Around the city's storehouses they wreathe and twine and dance,"
13923,IV,And wealth and splendor shrivel up before their swift advance.
13924,IV,Before their devastating breath the stricken people flee.
13925,IV,"""Mine, mine your treasures are!"" cried Death, and laughs in fiendish glee."
13926,IV,"Into that vortex of red hell sink church and theatre, store, hotel."
13927,IV,With thunderous roar and hissing yell on sweeps the crimson sea.
13928,IV,
13929,IV,Again with charge of dynamite the lurid clouds are riven;
13930,IV,Again with heat and sulphur smoke the troops are backward driven.
13931,IV,"All day, all night, all day again, with that infernal host"
13932,IV,"They strive in vain for mastery. Each vantage gained is lost,--"
13933,IV,On comes the bellowing flood of flame in furious wrath its own to claim;
13934,IV,Resistless in its awful aim each space is bridged and crossed.
13935,IV,
13936,IV,Ah God! the miles and miles of waste! One half the city gone!
13937,IV,And westward now--toward Van Ness--the roaring flames roll on.
13938,IV,"""Blow up that mile of palaces!"" It is the last command,"
13939,IV,"And there, at broad Van Ness, the troops make their heroic stand."
13940,IV,"The fight is now for life--sweet life, for helpless babe and homeless"
13941,IV,wife--
13942,IV,The culmination of the strife spectacularly grand.
13943,IV,
13944,IV,On sweeps the hurricane of fire. The fatal touch is given.
13945,IV,The detonation of the blast goes shrieking up to heaven.
13946,IV,The mansions of bonanza kings are tottering to their doom;
13947,IV,That swirling tide of fiery fate halts at the gaping tomb.
13948,IV,"Beyond the cataclysm's brink, the multitude, too dazed to think,"

14038,A DIRGE,"But maybe I won't need it here, with this nice furnace heat;"

14040,A DIRGE,"Oh, not so much. My rose quilt, now, all white and green and pink,"
14041,A DIRGE,"Is really handsome. This is just a plain, log cabin block,"
14042,A DIRGE,Pieced out of odds and ends; but still--now that's your papa's frock
14043,A DIRGE,"Before he walked, and this bit here is his first little suit."
14044,A DIRGE,"I trimmed it up with silver braid. My, but he did look cute!"

14050,A DIRGE,And little Edson wore this waist. He never came again.

14056,A DIRGE,"But somewhere, now, the dear boy sleeps among the unknown dead."
14057,A DIRGE,"That flowered patch? Well, now, to think you'd pick that from the rest!"
14058,A DIRGE,"Why, dearie--yes, it's satin ribbed--that's grandpa's wedding vest!"
14059,A DIRGE,"Just odds and ends! no great for looks. My rose quilt's nicer, far,"

14073,A DIRGE,The sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke.
14074,A DIRGE,
14075,A DIRGE,"Their attitude and aspect were the same,"
14076,A DIRGE,Alike their features and their robes of white;
14077,A DIRGE,"But one was crowned with amaranth, as with flame,"
14078,A DIRGE,"And one with asphodels, like flakes of light."
14079,A DIRGE,
14080,A DIRGE,I saw them pause on their celestial way;

14090,A DIRGE,"I recognized the nameless agony,"
14091,A DIRGE,"The terror and the tremor and the pain,"
14092,A DIRGE,"That oft before had filled or haunted me,"
14093,A DIRGE,And now returned with threefold strength again.
14094,A DIRGE,
14095,A DIRGE,"The door I opened to my heavenly guest,"
14096,A DIRGE,"And listened, for I thought I heard God's voice;"

14098,A DIRGE,Dared neither to lament nor to rejoice.
14099,A DIRGE,
14100,A DIRGE,"Then with a smile, that filled the house with light,"
14101,A DIRGE,"""My errand is not Death, but Life,"" he said;"
14102,A DIRGE,"And ere I answered, passing out of sight,"
14103,A DIRGE,On his celestial embassy he sped.
14104,A DIRGE,
14105,A DIRGE,"'Twas at thy door, O friend! and not at mine,"
14106,A DIRGE,"The angel with the amaranthine wreath,"
14107,A DIRGE,"Pausing, descended, and with, voice divine,"
14108,A DIRGE,Whispered a word that had a sound like Death.
14109,A DIRGE,
14110,A DIRGE,"Then fell upon the house a sudden gloom,"
14111,A DIRGE,A shadow on those features fair and thin;
14112,A DIRGE,"And softly, from that hushed and darkened room,"
14113,A DIRGE,"Two angels issued, where but one went in."
14114,A DIRGE,
14115,A DIRGE,"All is of God! If he but waves his hand,"
14116,A DIRGE,"The mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud,"
14117,A DIRGE,"Till, with a smile of light on sea and land,"
14118,A DIRGE,Lo! he looks back from the departing cloud.
14119,A DIRGE,
14120,A DIRGE,Angels of Life and Death alike are his;
14121,A DIRGE,Without his leave they pass no threshold o'er;

14162,A DIRGE,Of healthful strength and painless nerves!
14163,A DIRGE,"And jests went round, and laughs that made"
14164,A DIRGE,"The house-dog answer with his howl,"
14165,A DIRGE,And kept astir the barn-yard fowl.
14166,A DIRGE,
14167,A DIRGE,"And quaint old songs their fathers sung,"
14168,A DIRGE,"In Derby dales and Yorkshire moors,"
14169,A DIRGE,Ere Norman William trod their shores;
14170,A DIRGE,"And tales, whose merry license shook"
14171,A DIRGE,"The fat sides of the Saxon thane,"
14172,A DIRGE,Forgetful of the hovering Dane!
14173,A DIRGE,
14174,A DIRGE,But still the sweetest voice was mute
14175,A DIRGE,That river-valley ever heard
14176,A DIRGE,From lip of maid or throat of bird;
14177,A DIRGE,"For Mabel Martin sat apart,"
14178,A DIRGE,And let the hay-mow's shadow 'fall
14179,A DIRGE,Upon the loveliest face of all.
14180,A DIRGE,"She sat apart, as one forbid,"
14181,A DIRGE,Who knew that none would condescend
14182,A DIRGE,To own the Witch-wife's child a friend.
14183,A DIRGE,
14184,A DIRGE,"The seasons scarce had gone their round,"
14185,A DIRGE,Since curious thousands thronged to see
14186,A DIRGE,Her mother on the gallows-tree;
14187,A DIRGE,"And mocked the palsied limbs of age,"
14188,A DIRGE,"That faltered on the fatal stairs,"
14189,A DIRGE,And wan lip trembling with its prayers!
14190,A DIRGE,
14191,A DIRGE,"Few questioned of the sorrowing child,"
14192,A DIRGE,"Or, when they saw the mother die,"
14193,A DIRGE,Dreamed of the daughter's agony.
14194,A DIRGE,"They went up to their homes that day,"
14195,A DIRGE,As men and Christians justified:
14196,A DIRGE,"God willed it, and the wretch had died!"
14197,A DIRGE,
14198,A DIRGE,"Dear God and Father of us all,"
14199,A DIRGE,"Forgive our faith in cruel lies,--"
14200,A DIRGE,Forgive the blindness that denies!
14201,A DIRGE,"Forgive Thy creature when he takes,"
14202,A DIRGE,"For the all-perfect love Thou art,"
14203,A DIRGE,Some grim creation of his heart.
14204,A DIRGE,"Cast down our idols, overturn"
14205,A DIRGE,Our bloody altars; let us see
14206,A DIRGE,Thyself in Thy humanity!
14207,A DIRGE,
14208,A DIRGE,Poor Mabel from her mother's grave
14209,A DIRGE,"Crept to her desolate hearth-stone,"
14210,A DIRGE,And wrestled with her fate alone;
14211,A DIRGE,"With love, and anger, and despair,"
14212,A DIRGE,"The phantoms of disordered sense,"
14213,A DIRGE,The awful doubts of Providence!
14214,A DIRGE,"The school-boys jeered her as they passed,"
14215,A DIRGE,"And, when she sought the house of prayer,"
14216,A DIRGE,Her mother's curse pursued her there.
14217,A DIRGE,And still o'er many a neighboring door
14218,A DIRGE,"She saw the horseshoe's curved charm,"
14219,A DIRGE,To guard against her mother's harm;--
14220,A DIRGE,
14221,A DIRGE,"That mother, poor, and sick, and lame,"
14222,A DIRGE,"Who daily, by the old arm-chair,"
14223,A DIRGE,Folded her withered hands in prayer;--
14224,A DIRGE,"Who turned, in Salem's dreary jail,"
14225,A DIRGE,"Her worn old Bible o'er and o'er,"
14226,A DIRGE,When her dim eyes could read no more!
14227,A DIRGE,
14228,A DIRGE,"Sore tried and pained, the poor girl kept"
14229,A DIRGE,"Her faith, and trusted that her way,"
14230,A DIRGE,"So dark, would somewhere meet the day."
14231,A DIRGE,"And still her weary wheel went round,"
14232,A DIRGE,"Day after day, with no relief:"
14233,A DIRGE,Small leisure have the poor for grief.
14234,A DIRGE,
14235,A DIRGE,So in the shadow Mabel sits;
14236,A DIRGE,"Untouched by mirth she sees and hears,"
14237,A DIRGE,Her smile is sadder than her tears.
14238,A DIRGE,"But cruel eyes have found her out,"
14239,A DIRGE,"And cruel lips repeat her name,"
14240,A DIRGE,And taunt her with her mother's shame.
14241,A DIRGE,
14242,A DIRGE,"She answered not with railing words,"
14243,A DIRGE,"But drew her apron o'er her face,"
14244,A DIRGE,"And, sobbing, glided from the place."
14245,A DIRGE,"And only pausing at the door,"
14246,A DIRGE,Her sad eyes met the troubled gaze
14247,A DIRGE,"Of one who, in her better days,"
14248,A DIRGE,"Had been her warm and steady friend,"
14249,A DIRGE,Ere yet her mother's doom had made
14250,A DIRGE,Even Esek Harden half afraid.
14251,A DIRGE,
14252,A DIRGE,"He felt that mute appeal of tears,"
14253,A DIRGE,"And, starting, with an angry frown"
14254,A DIRGE,"Hushed all the wicked murmurs down,"
14255,A DIRGE,"""Good neighbors mine,"" he sternly said,"
14256,A DIRGE,"""This passes harmless mirth or jest;"
14257,A DIRGE,I brook no insult to my guest.
14258,A DIRGE,
14259,A DIRGE,"""She is indeed her mother's child;"
14260,A DIRGE,But God's sweet pity ministers
14261,A DIRGE,Unto no whiter soul than hers.
14262,A DIRGE,Let Goody Martin rest in peace;
14263,A DIRGE,"I never knew her harm a fly,"
14264,A DIRGE,"And witch or not, God knows,--not I."
14265,A DIRGE,I know who swore her life away;
14266,A DIRGE,"And, as God lives, I'd not condemn"
14267,A DIRGE,"An Indian dog on word of them."""
14268,A DIRGE,
14269,A DIRGE,"Poor Mabel, in her lonely home,"
14270,A DIRGE,"Sat by the window's narrow pane,"
14271,A DIRGE,White in the moonlight's silver rain.
14272,A DIRGE,"The river, on its pebbled rim,"
14273,A DIRGE,Made music such as childhood knew;
14274,A DIRGE,The door-yard tree was whispered through
14275,A DIRGE,By voices such as childhood's ear
14276,A DIRGE,Had heard in moonlights long ago;
14277,A DIRGE,And through the willow boughs below
14278,A DIRGE,She saw the rippled waters shine;
14279,A DIRGE,"Beyond, in waves of shade and light"
14280,A DIRGE,The hills rolled off into the night.
14281,A DIRGE,
14282,A DIRGE,Sweet sounds and pictures mocking so
14283,A DIRGE,"The sadness of her human lot,"
14284,A DIRGE,"She saw and heard, but heeded not."
14285,A DIRGE,"She strove to drown her sense of wrong,"
14286,A DIRGE,"And, in her old and simple way,"
14287,A DIRGE,"To teach, her bitter heart to pray."
14288,A DIRGE,
14289,A DIRGE,"Poor child! the prayer, began in faith,"
14290,A DIRGE,"Grew to a low, despairing cry"
14291,A DIRGE,"Of utter misery: ""Let me die!"
14292,A DIRGE,"Oh! take me from the scornful eyes,"
14293,A DIRGE,And hide me where the cruel speech
14294,A DIRGE,And mocking finger may not reach!
14295,A DIRGE,
14296,A DIRGE,"""I dare not breathe my mother's name;"
14297,A DIRGE,A daughter's right I dare not crave
14298,A DIRGE,To weep above her unblest grave!
14299,A DIRGE,"Let me not live until my heart,"
14300,A DIRGE,"With few to pity, and with none"
14301,A DIRGE,"To love me, hardens into stone."
14302,A DIRGE,"O God! have mercy on thy child,"
14303,A DIRGE,"Whose faith in Thee grows weak and small,"
14304,A DIRGE,"And take me ere I lose it all."""
14305,A DIRGE,
14306,A DIRGE,"The broadest lands in all the town,"
14307,A DIRGE,"The skill to guide, the power to awe,"
14308,A DIRGE,Were Harden's; and his word was law.
14309,A DIRGE,"None dared withstand him to his face,"
14310,A DIRGE,But one sly maiden spake aside:
14311,A DIRGE,"""The little witch is evil-eyed!"
14312,A DIRGE,"Her mother only killed a cow,"
14313,A DIRGE,Or witched a churn or dairy-pan;
14314,A DIRGE,"But she, forsooth, must charm a man!"""
14315,A DIRGE,
14316,A DIRGE,"A shadow on the moonlight fell,"
14317,A DIRGE,And murmuring wind and wave became
14318,A DIRGE,A voice whose burden was her name.
14319,A DIRGE,Had then God heard her? Had he sent
14320,A DIRGE,"His angel down? In flesh and blood,"
14321,A DIRGE,Before her Esek Harden stood!
14322,A DIRGE,
14323,A DIRGE,He laid his hand upon her arm:
14324,A DIRGE,"""Dear Mabel, this no more shall be;"
14325,A DIRGE,"Who scoffs at you, must scoff at me."
14326,A DIRGE,You know rough Esek Harden well;
14327,A DIRGE,"And if he seems no suitor gay,"
14328,A DIRGE,"And if his hair is mixed with gray,"
14329,A DIRGE,The maiden grown shall never find
14330,A DIRGE,His heart less warm than when she smiled
14331,A DIRGE,"Upon his knees, a little child!"""
14332,A DIRGE,
14333,A DIRGE,"Her tears of grief were tears of joy,"
14334,A DIRGE,"As folded in his strong embrace,"
14335,A DIRGE,She looked in Esek Harden's face.
14336,A DIRGE,"""O truest friend of all!"" she said,"
14337,A DIRGE,"""God bless you for your kindly thought,"
14338,A DIRGE,"And make me worthy of my lot!"""
14339,A DIRGE,
14340,A DIRGE,"He led her through his dewy fields,"
14341,A DIRGE,"To where the swinging lanterns glowed,"
14342,A DIRGE,And through the doors the huskers showed.
14343,A DIRGE,"""Good friends and neighbors!"" Esek said,"
14344,A DIRGE,"""I'm weary of this lonely life;"
14345,A DIRGE,In Mabel see my chosen wife!
14346,A DIRGE,
14347,A DIRGE,"""She greets you kindly, one and all:"
14348,A DIRGE,"The past is past, and all offence"
14349,A DIRGE,Falls harmless from her innocence.
14350,A DIRGE,Henceforth she stands no more alone;
14351,A DIRGE,You know what Esek Harden is;--
14352,A DIRGE,"He brooks no wrong to him or his."""
14353,A DIRGE,
14354,A DIRGE,"Now let the merriest tales be told,"
14355,A DIRGE,"And let the sweetest songs be sung,"
14356,A DIRGE,That ever made the old heart young!
14357,A DIRGE,For now the lost has found a home;
14358,A DIRGE,"And a lone hearth shall brighter burn,"
14359,A DIRGE,As all the household joys return!
14360,A DIRGE,
14361,A DIRGE,"Oh, pleasantly the harvest moon,"
14362,A DIRGE,"Between the shadow of the mows,"
14363,A DIRGE,Looked on them through the great elm-boughs!
14364,A DIRGE,"On Mabel's curls of golden hair,"
14365,A DIRGE,On Esek's shaggy strength it fell;
14366,A DIRGE,"And the wind whispered, ""It is well!"""

14373,A DIRGE,David's Lament for Absalom
14374,A DIRGE,
14375,A DIRGE,
14376,A DIRGE,King David's limbs were weary. He had fled
14377,A DIRGE,From far Jerusalem; and now he stood
14378,A DIRGE,With his faint people for a little rest
14379,A DIRGE,Upon the shore of Jordan. The light wind
14380,A DIRGE,"Of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow"
14381,A DIRGE,To its refreshing breath; for he had worn
14382,A DIRGE,"The mourner's covering, and he had not felt"
14383,A DIRGE,That he could see his people until now.
14384,A DIRGE,
14385,A DIRGE,They gathered round him on the fresh green bank
14386,A DIRGE,"And spoke their kindly words, and as the sun"
14387,A DIRGE,"Rose up in heaven he knelt among them there,"
14388,A DIRGE,And bowed his head upon his hands to pray.
14389,A DIRGE,Oh! when the heart is full--where bitter thoughts
14390,A DIRGE,"Come crowding thickly up for utterance,"
14391,A DIRGE,"And the poor common words of courtesy,--"
14392,A DIRGE,Are such a mockery--how much
14393,A DIRGE,The bursting heart may pour itself in prayer!
14394,A DIRGE,He prayed for Israel--and his voice went up
14395,A DIRGE,Strongly and fervently. He prayed for those
14396,A DIRGE,Whose love had been his shield--and his deep tones
14397,A DIRGE,"Grew tremulous. But, oh! for Absalom,"
14398,A DIRGE,"For his estranged, misguided Absalom--"
14399,A DIRGE,"The proud, bright being who had burst away"
14400,A DIRGE,In all his princely beauty to defy
14401,A DIRGE,"The heart that cherished him--for him he prayed,"
14402,A DIRGE,"In agony that would not be controll'd,"
14403,A DIRGE,"Strong supplication, and forgave him there"
14404,A DIRGE,Before his God for his deep sinfulness.
14405,A DIRGE,
14406,A DIRGE,The pall was settled. He who slept beneath
14407,A DIRGE,"Was straightened for the grave, and as the folds"
14408,A DIRGE,"Sank to their still proportions, they betrayed"
14409,A DIRGE,"The matchless symmetry of Absalom,"
14410,A DIRGE,The mighty Joab stood beside the bier
14411,A DIRGE,"And gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly,"
14412,A DIRGE,As if he feared the slumberer might stir.
14413,A DIRGE,A slow step startled him. He grasped his blade
14414,A DIRGE,"As if a trumpet rang, but the bent form"
14415,A DIRGE,Of David entered; and he gave command
14416,A DIRGE,"In a low tone to his few followers,"
14417,A DIRGE,And left him with the dead.
14418,A DIRGE,
14419,A DIRGE,The King stood still
14420,A DIRGE,"Till the last echo died; then, throwing off"
14421,A DIRGE,"The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back"
14422,A DIRGE,The pall from the still features of his child.
14423,A DIRGE,He bowed his head upon him and broke forth
14424,A DIRGE,In the resistless eloquence of woe:
14425,A DIRGE,
14426,A DIRGE,"""Alas! my noble boy; that thou shouldst die!"
14427,A DIRGE,Thou who were made so beautifully fair!
14428,A DIRGE,"That death should settle in thy glorious eye,"
14429,A DIRGE,And leave his stillness in this clustering hair!
14430,A DIRGE,"How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,"
14431,A DIRGE,"My proud boy, Absalom!"
14432,A DIRGE,
14433,A DIRGE,"""Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill"
14434,A DIRGE,As to my bosom I have tried to press thee!
14435,A DIRGE,How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill
14436,A DIRGE,"Like a rich harp-string yearning to caress thee,"
14437,A DIRGE,And hear thy sweet 'my father!' from those dumb
14438,A DIRGE,"And cold lips, Absalom!"
14439,A DIRGE,
14440,A DIRGE,"""But death is on thee! I shall hear the gush"
14441,A DIRGE,"Of music, and the voices of the young;"
14442,A DIRGE,"And life will pass me in the mantling blush,"
14443,A DIRGE,And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung;--
14444,A DIRGE,"But thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come"
14445,A DIRGE,"To meet me, Absalom!"
14446,A DIRGE,
14447,A DIRGE,"""And oh! when I am stricken, and my heart,"
14448,A DIRGE,"Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken,"
14449,A DIRGE,"How will its love for thee, as I depart,"
14450,A DIRGE,Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token!
14451,A DIRGE,"It were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom,"
14452,A DIRGE,"To see thee, Absalom!"
14453,A DIRGE,
14454,A DIRGE,"""And now, farewell! 'Tis hard to give thee up,"
14455,A DIRGE,With death so like a gentle slumber on thee!--
14456,A DIRGE,"And thy dark sin! Oh! I could drink the cup,"
14457,A DIRGE,If from this woe its bitterness had won thee.
14458,A DIRGE,"May God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,"
14459,A DIRGE,"My lost boy, Absalom!"""
14460,A DIRGE,
14461,A DIRGE,"He covered up his face, and bowed himself"
14462,A DIRGE,"A moment on his child; then, giving him"
14463,A DIRGE,"A look of melting tenderness, he clasped"
14464,A DIRGE,"His hands convulsively, as if in prayer,"
14465,A DIRGE,"And, as if strength were given him of God,"
14466,A DIRGE,"He rose up calmly, and composed the pall"
14467,A DIRGE,"Firmly and decently--and left him there,"
14468,A DIRGE,As if his rest had been a breathing sleep.

14475,A DIRGE,Christmas Day in the Workhouse
14476,A DIRGE,
14477,A DIRGE,
14478,A DIRGE,"It is Christmas day in the workhouse,"
14479,A DIRGE,And the cold bare walls are bright
14480,A DIRGE,"With garlands of green and holly,"
14481,A DIRGE,And the place is a pleasant sight:
14482,A DIRGE,"For with clean-washed hands and faces,"
14483,A DIRGE,In a long and hungry line
14484,A DIRGE,"The paupers sit at the tables,"
14485,A DIRGE,For this is the hour they dine.
14486,A DIRGE,
14487,A DIRGE,"And the guardians and their ladies,"
14488,A DIRGE,"Although the wind is east,"
14489,A DIRGE,Have come in their furs and wrappers
14490,A DIRGE,To watch their charges feast;
14491,A DIRGE,"To smile and be condescending,"
14492,A DIRGE,"Put pudding on pauper plates,"
14493,A DIRGE,To be hosts at the workhouse banquet
14494,A DIRGE,They've paid for--with the rates.
14495,A DIRGE,
14496,A DIRGE,"Oh, the paupers are meek and lowly"
14497,A DIRGE,"With their ""Thank'ee kindly, mum's"";"
14498,A DIRGE,"So long as they fill their stomachs,"
14499,A DIRGE,What matter whence it comes?
14500,A DIRGE,"But one of the old men mutters,"
14501,A DIRGE,And pushes his plate aside:
14502,A DIRGE,"""Great God!"" he cries; ""but it chokes me;"
14503,A DIRGE,"For this is the day _she_ died."""
14504,A DIRGE,
14505,A DIRGE,"The guardians gazed in horror,"
14506,A DIRGE,The master's face went white:
14507,A DIRGE,"""Did a pauper refuse their pudding?"""
14508,A DIRGE,"""Could their ears believe aright?"""
14509,A DIRGE,Then the ladies clutched their husbands
14510,A DIRGE,"Thinking the man would die,"
14511,A DIRGE,"Struck by a bolt, or something,"
14512,A DIRGE,By the outraged One on high.
14513,A DIRGE,
14514,A DIRGE,"But the pauper sat for a moment,"
14515,A DIRGE,"Then rose 'mid a silence grim,"
14516,A DIRGE,"For the others had ceased to chatter,"
14517,A DIRGE,And trembled in every limb.
14518,A DIRGE,"He looked at the guardians' ladies,"
14519,A DIRGE,"Then, eyeing their lords, he said:"

14558,A DIRGE,
14559,A DIRGE,"""Last winter my wife lay dying,"
14560,A DIRGE,Starved in a filthy den;
14561,A DIRGE,"I had never been to the parish,--"
14562,A DIRGE,I came to the parish then.
14563,A DIRGE,"I swallowed my pride in coming,"
14564,A DIRGE,"For, ere the ruin came."
14565,A DIRGE,"I held up my head as a trader,"
14566,A DIRGE,And I bore a spotless name.
14567,A DIRGE,
14568,A DIRGE,"""I came to the parish, craving"
14569,A DIRGE,"Bread for a starving wife,"
14570,A DIRGE,Bread for the woman who'd loved me
14571,A DIRGE,Through fifty years of life;
14572,A DIRGE,"And what do you think they told me,"
14573,A DIRGE,Mocking my awful grief?
14574,A DIRGE,"That 'the House' was open to us,"
14575,A DIRGE,But they wouldn't give 'out relief.'
14576,A DIRGE,
14577,A DIRGE,"""I slunk to the filthy alley--"
14578,A DIRGE,"'Twas a cold, raw Christmas eve--"
14579,A DIRGE,"And the bakers' shops were open,"
14580,A DIRGE,Tempting a man to thieve:
14581,A DIRGE,"But I clenched my fists together,"
14582,A DIRGE,"Holding my head awry,"
14583,A DIRGE,So I came to her empty-handed
14584,A DIRGE,And mournfully told her why.
14585,A DIRGE,
14586,A DIRGE,"""Then I told her 'the House' was open;"
14587,A DIRGE,"She had heard of the ways of _that_,"
14588,A DIRGE,"For her bloodless cheeks went crimson,"
14589,A DIRGE,"And up in her rags she sat,"
14590,A DIRGE,"Crying, 'Bide the Christmas here, John,"
14591,A DIRGE,We've never had one apart;
14592,A DIRGE,"I think I can bear the hunger,--"
14593,A DIRGE,The other would break my heart.'
14594,A DIRGE,
14595,A DIRGE,"""All through that eve I watched her,"
14596,A DIRGE,"Holding her hand in mine,"
14597,A DIRGE,"Praying the Lord, and weeping"
14598,A DIRGE,Till my lips were salt as brine.
14599,A DIRGE,"I asked her once if she hungered,"
14600,A DIRGE,"And as she answered 'No,'"
14601,A DIRGE,The moon shone in at the window
14602,A DIRGE,Set in a wreath of snow.
14603,A DIRGE,
14604,A DIRGE,"""Then the room was bathed in glory,"
14605,A DIRGE,And I saw in my darling's eyes
14606,A DIRGE,The far-away look of wonder
14607,A DIRGE,That comes when the spirit flies;
14608,A DIRGE,"And her lips were parched and parted,"
14609,A DIRGE,"And her reason came and went,"
14610,A DIRGE,For she raved of our home in Devon
14611,A DIRGE,Where our happiest years were spent.
14612,A DIRGE,
14613,A DIRGE,"""And the accents, long forgotten,"
14614,A DIRGE,"Came back to the tongue once more,"
14615,A DIRGE,For she talked like the country lassie
14616,A DIRGE,I woo'd by the Devon shore.
14617,A DIRGE,"Then she rose to her feet and trembled,"
14618,A DIRGE,"And fell on the rags and moaned,"
14619,A DIRGE,"And, 'Give me a crust--I'm famished--"
14620,A DIRGE,For the love of God!' she groaned.
14621,A DIRGE,
14622,A DIRGE,"""I rushed from the room like a madman,"
14623,A DIRGE,"And flew to the workhouse gate,"
14624,A DIRGE,Crying 'Food for a dying woman?'
14625,A DIRGE,"And the answer came, 'Too late.'"
14626,A DIRGE,They drove me away with curses;
14627,A DIRGE,"Then I fought with a dog in the street,"
14628,A DIRGE,And tore from the mongrel's clutches
14629,A DIRGE,A crust he was trying to eat.
14630,A DIRGE,
14631,A DIRGE,"""Back, through the filthy by-lanes!"
14632,A DIRGE,"Back, through the trampled slush!"
14633,A DIRGE,"Up to the crazy garret,"
14634,A DIRGE,Wrapped in an awful hush.
14635,A DIRGE,"My heart sank down at the threshold,"
14636,A DIRGE,"And I paused with a sudden thrill,"
14637,A DIRGE,For there in the silv'ry moonlight
14638,A DIRGE,"My Nance lay, cold and still."
14639,A DIRGE,
14640,A DIRGE,"""Up to the blackened ceiling"
14641,A DIRGE,The sunken eyes were cast--
14642,A DIRGE,I knew on those lips all bloodless
14643,A DIRGE,My name had been the last:
14644,A DIRGE,She'd called for her absent husband--
14645,A DIRGE,O God! had I but known!--
14646,A DIRGE,"Had called in vain, and in anguish"
14647,A DIRGE,Had died in that den--_alone_.
14648,A DIRGE,
14649,A DIRGE,"""Yes, there, in a land of plenty,"
14650,A DIRGE,"Lay a loving woman dead,"
14651,A DIRGE,Cruelly starved and murdered
14652,A DIRGE,For a loaf of the parish bread.
14653,A DIRGE,"At yonder gate, last Christmas,"
14654,A DIRGE,I craved for a human life.
14655,A DIRGE,"You, who would feast us paupers,"
14656,A DIRGE,_What of my murdered wife!_
14657,A DIRGE,
14658,A DIRGE,*       *       *       *       *
14659,A DIRGE,

14661,A DIRGE,Don't mind me in the least;
14662,A DIRGE,Think of the happy paupers
14663,A DIRGE,Eating your Christmas feast;
14664,A DIRGE,And when you recount their blessings
14665,A DIRGE,"In your snug, parochial way,"
14666,A DIRGE,"Say what you did for _me_, too,"

14680,A DIRGE,"'Twas Jefferson, and Madison, and then came James Monroe."
14681,A DIRGE,
14682,A DIRGE,"Massachusetts for one term sent Adams called John Q.,"
14683,A DIRGE,"And Tennessee a Democrat, brave Jackson staunch and true."
14684,A DIRGE,"Martin Van Buren of New York, and Harrison we see,"
14685,A DIRGE,"And Tyler of Virginia, and Polk of Tennessee."
14686,A DIRGE,
14687,A DIRGE,Louisiana Taylor sent; New York Millard Fillmore;
14688,A DIRGE,New Hampshire gave us Franklin Pierce; when his term was o'er
14689,A DIRGE,The keystone state Buchanan sent.  War thunders shook the realm
14690,A DIRGE,"Abe Lincoln wore a martyr's crown, and Johnson took the helm."
14691,A DIRGE,
14692,A DIRGE,Then U.S. Grant of Illinois who ruled with sword and pen;
14693,A DIRGE,"And Hayes, and Garfield who was shot, two noble Buckeye men."
14694,A DIRGE,"Chester Arthur from New York, and Grover Cleveland came;"
14695,A DIRGE,"Ben Harrison served just four years, then Cleveland ruled again."
14696,A DIRGE,
14697,A DIRGE,"McKinley--shot at Buffalo--the nation plunged in grief,"
14698,A DIRGE,"And ""Teddy"" Roosevelt of New York served seven years as chief."
14699,A DIRGE,Taft of Ohio followed him. Then Woodrow Wilson came--
14700,A DIRGE,New Jersey's learned Democrat; war set the world aflame;
14701,A DIRGE,
14702,A DIRGE,"And when the tide of strife and hate its baneful course had run,"
14703,A DIRGE,The country went Republican and Warren Harding won.

14712,A DIRGE,Annie and Willie's Prayer
14713,A DIRGE,
14714,A DIRGE,
14715,A DIRGE,"'Twas the eve before Christmas; ""Good night"" had been said,"
14716,A DIRGE,And Annie and Willie had crept into bed;
14717,A DIRGE,"There were tears on their pillows, and tears in their eyes,"
14718,A DIRGE,"And each little bosom was heaving with sighs,"
14719,A DIRGE,For to-night their stern father's command had been given
14720,A DIRGE,That they should retire precisely at seven
14721,A DIRGE,Instead of at eight; for they troubled him more
14722,A DIRGE,With questions unheard of than ever before;
14723,A DIRGE,"He had told them he thought this delusion a sin,"
14724,A DIRGE,"No such being as Santa Claus ever had been,"
14725,A DIRGE,"And he hoped, after this, he should never more hear"
14726,A DIRGE,"How he scrambled down chimneys with presents, each year,"
14727,A DIRGE,And this was the reason that two little heads
14728,A DIRGE,So restlessly tossed on their soft downy beds.
14729,A DIRGE,
14730,A DIRGE,"Eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten;"
14731,A DIRGE,Not a word had been spoken by either till then;
14732,A DIRGE,"When Willie's sad face from the blanket did peep,"
14733,A DIRGE,"And whispered, ""Dear Annie, is oo fast asleep?"""
14734,A DIRGE,"""Why, no, brother Willie,"" a sweet voice replies,"
14735,A DIRGE,"""I've tried it in vain, but I can't shut my eyes;"
14736,A DIRGE,"For somehow, it makes me so sorry because"
14737,A DIRGE,Dear papa has said there is no Santa Claus;
14738,A DIRGE,"Now we know there is, and it can't be denied,"
14739,A DIRGE,For he came every year before mamma died;
14740,A DIRGE,"But then I've been thinking that she used to pray,"
14741,A DIRGE,And God would hear everything mamma would say;
14742,A DIRGE,And perhaps she asked him to send Santa Claus here
14743,A DIRGE,"With the sacks full of presents he brought every year."""
14744,A DIRGE,"""Well, why tant we pray dest as mamma did then,"
14745,A DIRGE,"And ask Him to send him with presents aden?"""
14746,A DIRGE,"""I've been thinking so, too,"" and, without a word more,"
14747,A DIRGE,"Four little bare feet bounded out on the floor,"
14748,A DIRGE,"And four little knees the soft carpet pressed,"
14749,A DIRGE,And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast.
14750,A DIRGE,"""Now, Willie, you know we must firmly believe"
14751,A DIRGE,That the presents we ask for we're sure to receive;
14752,A DIRGE,"You must wait just as still till I say the 'Amen,'"
14753,A DIRGE,And by that you will know that your turn has come then.
14754,A DIRGE,"Dear Jesus, look down on my brother and me."
14755,A DIRGE,And grant as the favor we are asking of Thee!
14756,A DIRGE,"I want a wax dolly, a tea-set and ring,"
14757,A DIRGE,And an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring.
14758,A DIRGE,"Bless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see"
14759,A DIRGE,That Santa Claus loves us far better than he;
14760,A DIRGE,Don't let him get fretful and angry again
14761,A DIRGE,"At dear brother Willie, and Annie, Amen!"""
14762,A DIRGE,"""Peas Desus 'et Santa Taus tum down to-night,"
14763,A DIRGE,And bing us some pesents before it is 'ight;
14764,A DIRGE,"I want he should div me a nice ittle sed,"
14765,A DIRGE,"With bight, shiny unners, and all painted yed;"
14766,A DIRGE,"A box full of tandy, a book and a toy--"
14767,A DIRGE,"Amen--and then Desus, I'll be a dood boy."""
14768,A DIRGE,"Their prayers being ended they raised up their heads,"
14769,A DIRGE,And with hearts light and cheerful again sought their beds;
14770,A DIRGE,"They were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and deep,"
14771,A DIRGE,And with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep.
14772,A DIRGE,
14773,A DIRGE,"Eight, nine, and the little French clock had struck ten"
14774,A DIRGE,Ere the father had thought of his children again;
14775,A DIRGE,"He seems now to hear Annie's half suppressed sighs,"
14776,A DIRGE,And to see the big tears stand in Willie's blue eyes.
14777,A DIRGE,"""I was harsh with my darlings,"" he mentally said,"
14778,A DIRGE,"""And should not have sent them so early to bed;"
14779,A DIRGE,"But then I was troubled,--my feelings found vent,"
14780,A DIRGE,For bank-stock to-day has gone down ten per cent.
14781,A DIRGE,"But of course they've forgotten their troubles ere this,"
14782,A DIRGE,And that I denied them the thrice asked-for kiss;
14783,A DIRGE,"But just to make sure I'll steal up to their door,"
14784,A DIRGE,"For I never spoke harsh to my darlings before."""
14785,A DIRGE,"So saying, he softly ascended the stairs,"
14786,A DIRGE,And arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers.
14787,A DIRGE,"His Annie's ""bless papa"" draws forth the big tears,"
14788,A DIRGE,And Willie's grave promise falls sweet on his ears.
14789,A DIRGE,"""Strange, strange I'd forgotten,"" said he with a sigh,"
14790,A DIRGE,"""How I longed when a child to have Christmas draw nigh."
14791,A DIRGE,"I'll atone for my harshness,"" he inwardly said,"
14792,A DIRGE,"""By answering their prayers, ere I sleep in my bed."""
14793,A DIRGE,
14794,A DIRGE,"Then he turned to the stairs, and softly went down,"
14795,A DIRGE,Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing-gown;
14796,A DIRGE,"Donned hat, coat, and boots, and was out in the street,"
14797,A DIRGE,"A millionaire facing the cold driving sleet,"
14798,A DIRGE,"Nor stopped he until he had bought everything,"
14799,A DIRGE,From the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring.
14800,A DIRGE,Indeed he kept adding so much to his store
14801,A DIRGE,That the various presents outnumbered a score;
14802,A DIRGE,Then homeward he turned with his holiday load
14803,A DIRGE,And with Aunt Mary's aid in the nursery 'twas stowed.
14804,A DIRGE,"Miss Dolly was seated beneath a pine-tree,"
14805,A DIRGE,By the side of a table spread out for a tea;
14806,A DIRGE,"A work-box well filled in the centre was laid,"
14807,A DIRGE,And on it the ring for which Annie had prayed;
14808,A DIRGE,A soldier in uniform stood by a sled
14809,A DIRGE,"With bright shining runners, and all painted red;"
14810,A DIRGE,"There were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to see,"
14811,A DIRGE,"And birds of all colors--were perched in the tree,"
14812,A DIRGE,"While Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top,"
14813,A DIRGE,As if getting ready more presents to drop.
14814,A DIRGE,"And as the fond father the picture surveyed,"
14815,A DIRGE,He thought for his trouble he had amply been paid;
14816,A DIRGE,"And he said to himself as he brushed off a tear,"
14817,A DIRGE,"""I'm happier to-night than I've been for a year,"
14818,A DIRGE,I've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before--
14819,A DIRGE,What care I if bank-stocks fall ten per cent more.
14820,A DIRGE,"Hereafter I'll make it a rule, I believe,"
14821,A DIRGE,"To have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas eve."""
14822,A DIRGE,"So thinking he gently extinguished the light,"
14823,A DIRGE,And tripped down the stairs to retire for the night.
14824,A DIRGE,
14825,A DIRGE,As soon as the beams of the bright morning sun
14826,A DIRGE,"Put the darkness to flight, and the stars, one by one,"
14827,A DIRGE,"Four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide,"
14828,A DIRGE,And at the same moment the presents espied;
14829,A DIRGE,"Then out of their beds they sprang with a bound,"
14830,A DIRGE,And the very gifts prayed for were all of them found;
14831,A DIRGE,"They laughed and they cried in their innocent glee,"
14832,A DIRGE,And shouted for papa to come quick and see
14833,A DIRGE,What presents old Santa Claus brought in the night
14834,A DIRGE,(Just the things that they wanted) and left before light;
14835,A DIRGE,"""And now,"" added Annie, in a voice soft and low,"
14836,A DIRGE,"""You'll believe there's a Santa, Clans, papa, I know"";"
14837,A DIRGE,"While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee,"
14838,A DIRGE,"Determined no secret between them should be,"
14839,A DIRGE,And told in soft whispers how Annie had said
14840,A DIRGE,"That their blessed mamma, so long ago dead,"
14841,A DIRGE,"Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair,"
14842,A DIRGE,"And that God, up in heaven, had answered her prayer!"
14843,A DIRGE,"""Then we dot up, and payed dust as well as we tould,"
14844,A DIRGE,"And Dod answered our payers; now wasn't he dood?"""
14845,A DIRGE,
14846,A DIRGE,"""I should say that he was if he sent you all these,"
14847,A DIRGE,And knew just what presents my children would please.
14848,A DIRGE,"Well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf,"
14849,A DIRGE,"'Twould be cruel to tell him I did it myself."""
14850,A DIRGE,
14851,A DIRGE,"Blind father! who caused your proud heart to relent,"
14852,A DIRGE,And the hasty word spoken so soon to repent?
14853,A DIRGE,"'Twas the Being who made you steal softly upstairs,"
14854,A DIRGE,And made you His agent to answer their prayers.

14881,A DIRGE,"Through care and cumber, coldness and decay,"

14950,A DIRGE,Prayer and Potatoes
14951,A DIRGE,
14952,A DIRGE,
14953,A DIRGE,"An old lady sat in her old arm-chair,"
14954,A DIRGE,"With wrinkled visage and disheveled hair,"
14955,A DIRGE,And pale and hunger-worn features;
14956,A DIRGE,"For days and for weeks her only fare,"
14957,A DIRGE,"As she sat there in her old arm-chair,"
14958,A DIRGE,Had been potatoes.
14959,A DIRGE,
14960,A DIRGE,But now they were gone; of bad or good.
14961,A DIRGE,Not one was left for the old lady's food
14962,A DIRGE,Of those potatoes;
14963,A DIRGE,"And she sighed and said, ""What shall I do?"
14964,A DIRGE,"Where shall I send, and to whom shall I go"
14965,A DIRGE,"For more potatoes?"""
14966,A DIRGE,
14967,A DIRGE,"And she thought of the deacon over the way,"
14968,A DIRGE,"The deacon so ready to worship and pray,"
14969,A DIRGE,Whose cellar was full of potatoes;
14970,A DIRGE,"And she said: ""I will send for the deacon to come;"
14971,A DIRGE,He'll not mind much to give me some
14972,A DIRGE,"Of such a store of potatoes."""
14973,A DIRGE,
14974,A DIRGE,"And the deacon came over as fast as he could,"
14975,A DIRGE,"Thinking to do the old lady some good,"
14976,A DIRGE,But never thought of potatoes;
14977,A DIRGE,"He asked her at once what was her chief want,"
14978,A DIRGE,"And she, simple soul, expecting a grant,"
14979,A DIRGE,"Immediately answered, ""Potatoes."""
14980,A DIRGE,
14981,A DIRGE,But the deacon's religion didn't lie that way;
14982,A DIRGE,He was more accustomed to preach and pray
14983,A DIRGE,Than to give of his hoarded potatoes;
14984,A DIRGE,"So, not hearing, of course, what the old lady said,"
14985,A DIRGE,"He rose to pray with uncovered head,"
14986,A DIRGE,But _she_ only thought of potatoes.
14987,A DIRGE,
14988,A DIRGE,"He prayed for patience, and wisdom, and grace,"
14989,A DIRGE,"But when he prayed, ""Lord, give her peace,"""
14990,A DIRGE,"She audibly sighed ""Give potatoes"";"
14991,A DIRGE,"And at the end of each prayer which he said,"
14992,A DIRGE,"He heard, or thought that he heard in its stead,"
14993,A DIRGE,The same request for potatoes.
14994,A DIRGE,
14995,A DIRGE,The deacon was troubled; knew not what to do;
14996,A DIRGE,'Twas very embarrassing to have her act so
14997,A DIRGE,"About ""those carnal potatoes."""
14998,A DIRGE,"So, ending his prayer, he started for home;"
14999,A DIRGE,"As the door closed behind him, he heard a deep groan,"
15000,A DIRGE,"""Oh, give to the hungry, potatoes!"""
15001,A DIRGE,
15002,A DIRGE,And that groan followed him all the way home;
15003,A DIRGE,In the midst of the night it haunted his room--
15004,A DIRGE,"""Oh, give to the hungry, potatoes!"""
15005,A DIRGE,He could bear it no longer; arose and dressed;
15006,A DIRGE,From his well-filled cellar taking in haste
15007,A DIRGE,A bag of his best potatoes.
15008,A DIRGE,
15009,A DIRGE,Again he went to the widow's lone hut;
15010,A DIRGE,Her sleepless eyes she had not shut;
15011,A DIRGE,"But there she sat in that old arm-chair,"
15012,A DIRGE,"With the same wan features, the same sad air,"
15013,A DIRGE,"And, entering in, he poured on the floor"
15014,A DIRGE,A bushel or more from his goodly store
15015,A DIRGE,Of choicest potatoes.
15016,A DIRGE,
15017,A DIRGE,"The widow's cup was running o'er,"
15018,A DIRGE,Her face was haggard and wan no more.
15019,A DIRGE,"""Now,"" said the deacon, ""shall we pray?"""
15020,A DIRGE,"""Yes,"" said the widow, ""_now_ you may."""
15021,A DIRGE,"And he kneeled him down on the sanded floor,"
15022,A DIRGE,"Where he had poured his goodly store,"
15023,A DIRGE,And such a prayer the deacon prayed
15024,A DIRGE,As never before his lips essayed;
15025,A DIRGE,"No longer embarrassed, but free and full,"
15026,A DIRGE,"He poured out the voice of a liberal soul,"
15027,A DIRGE,"And the widow responded aloud ""Amen!"""
15028,A DIRGE,But spake no more of potatoes.
15029,A DIRGE,
15030,A DIRGE,"And would you, who hear this simple tale,"
15031,A DIRGE,"Pray for the poor, and praying, ""prevail""?"
15032,A DIRGE,Then preface your prayers with alms and good deeds;
15033,A DIRGE,"Search out the poor, their wants and their needs;"
15034,A DIRGE,"Pray for peace, and grace, and spiritual food,"
15035,A DIRGE,"For wisdom and guidance,-for all these are good,--"
15036,A DIRGE,_But don't forget the potatoes_.

15046,A DIRGE,Three little words you often see
15047,A DIRGE,"Are articles _a_, _an_, and _the_."

15049,A DIRGE,"As _house_ or _garden_, _hoop_ or _swing_."
15050,A DIRGE,Instead of nouns the pronouns stand--
15051,A DIRGE,"_Her_ head, _your_ face, _his_ arm, _my_ hand."
15052,A DIRGE,"Adjectives tell the kind of noun,"
15053,A DIRGE,"As _great_, _small_, _pretty_, _white_ or _brown_."
15054,A DIRGE,Verbs tell something to be done--
15055,A DIRGE,"To _read_, _count_, _sing_, _laugh_ or _run_."
15056,A DIRGE,"How things are done the adverbs tell,"
15057,A DIRGE,"As _slowly_, _quickly_, _ill_ or _well_."
15058,A DIRGE,"Conjunctions join the words together,"
15059,A DIRGE,"As men _and_ women, wind _or_ weather."
15060,A DIRGE,The preposition stands before
15061,A DIRGE,"A noun, as _in_ or _through_ a door."
15062,A DIRGE,"The interjection shows surprise,"
15063,A DIRGE,"As _oh!_ how pretty, _ah!_ how wise."

15420,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Or, if we were lost on the prairie"

15453,OUR PRESIDENT.,
15454,OUR PRESIDENT.,
15455,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Jim Brady's big brother's a wonderful lad,"
15456,OUR PRESIDENT.,"And wonderful, wonderful muscles he had;"
15457,OUR PRESIDENT.,He swung by one arm from the limb of a tree
15458,OUR PRESIDENT.,And hung there while Jim counted up forty-three
15459,OUR PRESIDENT.,Just as slow as he could; and he leaped at a bound
15460,OUR PRESIDENT.,Across a wide creek and lit square on the ground
15461,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Just as light as a deer; and the things he can do,"
15462,OUR PRESIDENT.,"So Jimmy told us, you would hardly think true."
15463,OUR PRESIDENT.,
15464,OUR PRESIDENT.,Jim Brady's big brother could throw a fly ball
15465,OUR PRESIDENT.,From center to home just like nothing at all;
15466,OUR PRESIDENT.,And often while playing a game he would stand
15467,OUR PRESIDENT.,And take a high fly with just only one hand;
15468,OUR PRESIDENT.,Jim Brady showed us where he knocked a home run
15469,OUR PRESIDENT.,And won the big game when it stood three to one
15470,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Against the home team, and Jim Brady, he showed"
15471,OUR PRESIDENT.,The place where it lit in the old wagon road!
15472,OUR PRESIDENT.,
15473,OUR PRESIDENT.,Jim Brady's big brother could bat up a fly
15474,OUR PRESIDENT.,"That you hardly could see, for it went up so high;"
15475,OUR PRESIDENT.,He'd bring up his muscle and break any string
15476,OUR PRESIDENT.,That you tied on his arm like it wasn't a thing!
15477,OUR PRESIDENT.,"He used to turn handsprings, and cartwheels, and he"
15478,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Could jump through his hands just as slick as could be,"
15479,OUR PRESIDENT.,And circuses often would want him to go
15480,OUR PRESIDENT.,"And be in the ring, but his mother said no."
15481,OUR PRESIDENT.,
15482,OUR PRESIDENT.,Jim Brady's big brother would often make bets
15483,OUR PRESIDENT.,With boys that he'd turn two complete summersets
15484,OUR PRESIDENT.,"From off of the spring-board before he would dive,"
15485,OUR PRESIDENT.,And you'd hardly think he would come up alive;
15486,OUR PRESIDENT.,And nobody else who went there to swim
15487,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Could do it, but it was just easy for him;"
15488,OUR PRESIDENT.,"And they'd all be scared, so Jim said, when he'd stay"
15489,OUR PRESIDENT.,In under and come up a half mile away.
15490,OUR PRESIDENT.,
15491,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Jim Brady's big brother, so Jim said, could run"
15492,OUR PRESIDENT.,Five miles in a race just as easy as one.
15493,OUR PRESIDENT.,Right often he walked on his hands half a block
15494,OUR PRESIDENT.,And could have walked more if he'd wanted to walk!
15495,OUR PRESIDENT.,"And Jimmy says wait till he comes home from school,"
15496,OUR PRESIDENT.,"Where he is gone now, and some day, when it's cool,"
15497,OUR PRESIDENT.,He'll get him to prove everything to be true
15498,OUR PRESIDENT.,That Jimmy told us his big brother could do!
