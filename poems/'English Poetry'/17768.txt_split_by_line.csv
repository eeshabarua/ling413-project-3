49,PREFATORY NOTE.,
50,PREFATORY NOTE.,
51,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Let me frankly admit, to begin with, that the attractiveness and"
52,PREFATORY NOTE.,"probable selling qualities of the title of this little book, ""The"
53,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Hundred Best English Poems,"" proved, when it had been once thought of,"
54,PREFATORY NOTE.,too powerful arguments for it to be abandoned. I am fully conscious of
55,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the presumption such a title implies in an unknown selector, but at"
56,PREFATORY NOTE.,the same time I submit that only a plebiscite of duly qualified lovers
57,PREFATORY NOTE.,of poetry could make a selection that could claim to deserve this
58,PREFATORY NOTE.,"title beyond all question, and such a plebiscite is of course"
59,PREFATORY NOTE.,impossible. I can claim no more than that my attempt to realize this
60,PREFATORY NOTE.,"title is an honest one, and I can assert, without fear of"
61,PREFATORY NOTE.,"contradiction, that every one of the poems I have included is a ""gem"
62,PREFATORY NOTE.,"of purest ray serene""; that none can be too often read or too often"
63,PREFATORY NOTE.,repeated to one's self; that every one of them should be known by
64,PREFATORY NOTE.,"heart by every lover of good literature, so that each may become, as"
65,PREFATORY NOTE.,"it were, a part of his inner being."
66,PREFATORY NOTE.,
67,PREFATORY NOTE.,I have not inserted any poems by living authors.
68,PREFATORY NOTE.,
69,PREFATORY NOTE.,I have taken the greatest care with the texts of the poems. The
70,PREFATORY NOTE.,editions followed have been mentioned in every case. I have
71,PREFATORY NOTE.,"scrupulously retained the punctuation of these original editions, and"
72,PREFATORY NOTE.,only modernized the spelling of the old copies; while I have not
73,PREFATORY NOTE.,ventured to omit any part of any poem. I have not supplied titles of
74,PREFATORY NOTE.,"my own, but have adopted those I found already employed in the"
75,PREFATORY NOTE.,"editions used as models, or, in some of the cases in which I found"
76,PREFATORY NOTE.,"none, have merely added a descriptive one, such as ""Song from 'Don"
77,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Juan.'"""
78,PREFATORY NOTE.,
79,PREFATORY NOTE.,"In conclusion, my very warmest thanks are due to Messrs. Macmillan &"
80,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Co., Ltd., for permission to include Tennyson's ""Crossing the Bar""; to"
81,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Mr. D. Nutt for permission to insert W. E. Henley's ""To R. T. H. B."""
82,PREFATORY NOTE.,"and ""Margaritæ Sorori""; to Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co. for a like"
83,PREFATORY NOTE.,"privilege in regard to Browning's ""Epilogue,"" and to Mr. Lloyd"
84,PREFATORY NOTE.,Osbourne and Messrs. Chatto & Windus for permission to reproduce
85,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Stevenson's ""Requiem."" Without these poems the volume would have had a"
86,PREFATORY NOTE.,"much smaller claim to its title than it does possess, slight as that"
87,PREFATORY NOTE.,may be. My thanks are also due to the following gentlemen who have
88,PREFATORY NOTE.,kindly allowed me to reproduce copyright texts of non-copyright poems
89,PREFATORY NOTE.,"from editions published by them: Messrs. Bickers & Son (Ben Jonson),"
90,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Messrs. Chapman & Hall, Ltd. (Landor), Messrs. Chatto & Windus"

2012,THOMAS HOOD,"Where I was used to swing,"

2014,THOMAS HOOD,To swallows on the wing;
2015,THOMAS HOOD,"My spirit flew in feathers then,"
2016,THOMAS HOOD,"That is so heavy now,"
2017,THOMAS HOOD,And summer pools could hardly cool
2018,THOMAS HOOD,The fever on my brow!
2019,THOMAS HOOD,
2020,THOMAS HOOD,"I remember, I remember"
2021,THOMAS HOOD,The fir trees dark and high;
2022,THOMAS HOOD,I used to think their slender tops
2023,THOMAS HOOD,Were close against the sky:
2024,THOMAS HOOD,"It was a childish ignorance,"
2025,THOMAS HOOD,But now 'tis little joy
2026,THOMAS HOOD,To know I'm farther off from Heav'n
2027,THOMAS HOOD,Than when I was a boy.

2069,JOHN KEATS,39. _On first looking into Chapman's Homer._
2070,JOHN KEATS,
2071,JOHN KEATS,"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,"
2072,JOHN KEATS,And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
2073,JOHN KEATS,Round many western islands have I been
2074,JOHN KEATS,Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
2075,JOHN KEATS,Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
2076,JOHN KEATS,That deep-brow'd Homer rul'd as his demesne;
2077,JOHN KEATS,Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
2078,JOHN KEATS,Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
2079,JOHN KEATS,Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
2080,JOHN KEATS,When a new planet swims into his ken;
2081,JOHN KEATS,Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
2082,JOHN KEATS,He star'd at the Pacific--and all his men
2083,JOHN KEATS,Looked at each other with a wild surmise--
2084,JOHN KEATS,"Silent, upon a peak in Darien."

2090,JOHN KEATS,
2091,JOHN KEATS,"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains"
2092,JOHN KEATS,"My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,"
2093,JOHN KEATS,Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
2094,JOHN KEATS,"One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:"
2095,JOHN KEATS,"'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,"
2096,JOHN KEATS,"But being too happy in thine happiness,--"
2097,JOHN KEATS,"That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,"
2098,JOHN KEATS,In some melodious plot
2099,JOHN KEATS,"Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,"
2100,JOHN KEATS,Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
2101,JOHN KEATS,
2102,JOHN KEATS,2.
2103,JOHN KEATS,
2104,JOHN KEATS,O for a draught of vintage! that hath been
2105,JOHN KEATS,"Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,"
2106,JOHN KEATS,"Tasting of Flora and the country green,"
2107,JOHN KEATS,"Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!"
2108,JOHN KEATS,"O for a beaker full of the warm South,"
2109,JOHN KEATS,"Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,"
2110,JOHN KEATS,"With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,"
2111,JOHN KEATS,And purple-stained mouth;
2112,JOHN KEATS,"That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,"
2113,JOHN KEATS,And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
2114,JOHN KEATS,
2115,JOHN KEATS,3.
2116,JOHN KEATS,
2117,JOHN KEATS,"Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget"
2118,JOHN KEATS,"What thou among the leaves hast never known,"
2119,JOHN KEATS,"The weariness, the fever, and the fret"
2120,JOHN KEATS,"Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;"
2121,JOHN KEATS,"Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,"
2122,JOHN KEATS,"Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;"
2123,JOHN KEATS,Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
2124,JOHN KEATS,"And leaden-ey'd despairs,"
2125,JOHN KEATS,"Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,"
2126,JOHN KEATS,Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
2127,JOHN KEATS,
2128,JOHN KEATS,4.
2129,JOHN KEATS,
2130,JOHN KEATS,"Away! away! for I will fly to thee,"
2131,JOHN KEATS,"Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,"
2132,JOHN KEATS,"But on the viewless wings of Poesy,"
2133,JOHN KEATS,Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
2134,JOHN KEATS,"Already with thee! tender is the night,"
2135,JOHN KEATS,"And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,"
2136,JOHN KEATS,Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
2137,JOHN KEATS,"But here there is no light,"
2138,JOHN KEATS,Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
2139,JOHN KEATS,Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
2140,JOHN KEATS,
2141,JOHN KEATS,5.
2142,JOHN KEATS,
2143,JOHN KEATS,"I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,"
2144,JOHN KEATS,"Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,"
2145,JOHN KEATS,"But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet"
2146,JOHN KEATS,Wherewith the seasonable month endows
2147,JOHN KEATS,"The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;"
2148,JOHN KEATS,"White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;"
2149,JOHN KEATS,Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
2150,JOHN KEATS,"And mid-May's eldest child,"
2151,JOHN KEATS,"The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,"
2152,JOHN KEATS,The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
2153,JOHN KEATS,
2154,JOHN KEATS,6.
2155,JOHN KEATS,
2156,JOHN KEATS,"Darkling I listen; and, for many a time"
2157,JOHN KEATS,"I have been half in love with easeful Death,"
2158,JOHN KEATS,"Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,"
2159,JOHN KEATS,To take into the air my quiet breath;
2160,JOHN KEATS,"Now more than ever seems it rich to die,"
2161,JOHN KEATS,"To cease upon the midnight with no pain,"
2162,JOHN KEATS,While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
2163,JOHN KEATS,In such an ecstasy!
2164,JOHN KEATS,"Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain--"
2165,JOHN KEATS,To thy high requiem become a sod.
2166,JOHN KEATS,
2167,JOHN KEATS,7.
2168,JOHN KEATS,
2169,JOHN KEATS,"Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!"
2170,JOHN KEATS,No hungry generations tread thee down;
2171,JOHN KEATS,The voice I hear this passing night was heard
2172,JOHN KEATS,In ancient days by emperor and clown:
2173,JOHN KEATS,Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
2174,JOHN KEATS,"Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,"
2175,JOHN KEATS,She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
2176,JOHN KEATS,The same that oft-times hath
2177,JOHN KEATS,"Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam"
2178,JOHN KEATS,"Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn."
2179,JOHN KEATS,
2180,JOHN KEATS,8.
2181,JOHN KEATS,
2182,JOHN KEATS,Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
2183,JOHN KEATS,To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
2184,JOHN KEATS,Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
2185,JOHN KEATS,"As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf."
2186,JOHN KEATS,Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
2187,JOHN KEATS,"Past the near meadows, over the still stream,"
2188,JOHN KEATS,Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
2189,JOHN KEATS,In the next valley-glades:
2190,JOHN KEATS,"Was it a vision, or a waking dream?"
2191,JOHN KEATS,Fled is that music:--do I wake or sleep?

2195,JOHN KEATS,
2196,JOHN KEATS,1.
2197,JOHN KEATS,
2198,JOHN KEATS,"Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,"
2199,JOHN KEATS,"Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,"
2200,JOHN KEATS,"Sylvan historian, who canst thus express"
2201,JOHN KEATS,A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
2202,JOHN KEATS,What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
2203,JOHN KEATS,"Of deities or mortals, or of both,"
2204,JOHN KEATS,In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
2205,JOHN KEATS,What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
2206,JOHN KEATS,What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
2207,JOHN KEATS,What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
2208,JOHN KEATS,
2209,JOHN KEATS,2.
2210,JOHN KEATS,
2211,JOHN KEATS,"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard"
2212,JOHN KEATS,"Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;"
2213,JOHN KEATS,"Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,"
2214,JOHN KEATS,Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
2215,JOHN KEATS,"Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave"
2216,JOHN KEATS,"Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;"
2217,JOHN KEATS,"Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,"
2218,JOHN KEATS,"Though winning near the goal--yet, do not grieve;"
2219,JOHN KEATS,"She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,"
2220,JOHN KEATS,"For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!"
2221,JOHN KEATS,
2222,JOHN KEATS,3.
2223,JOHN KEATS,
2224,JOHN KEATS,"Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed"
2225,JOHN KEATS,"Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;"
2226,JOHN KEATS,"And, happy melodist, unwearied,"
2227,JOHN KEATS,For ever piping songs for ever new;
2228,JOHN KEATS,"More happy love! more happy, happy love!"
2229,JOHN KEATS,"For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,"
2230,JOHN KEATS,"For ever panting, and for ever young;"
2231,JOHN KEATS,"All breathing human passion far above,"
2232,JOHN KEATS,"That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,"
2233,JOHN KEATS,"A burning forehead, and a parching tongue."
2234,JOHN KEATS,
2235,JOHN KEATS,4.
2236,JOHN KEATS,
2237,JOHN KEATS,Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
2238,JOHN KEATS,"To what green altar, O mysterious priest,"
2239,JOHN KEATS,"Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,"
2240,JOHN KEATS,And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
2241,JOHN KEATS,"What little town by river or sea shore,"
2242,JOHN KEATS,"Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,"
2243,JOHN KEATS,"Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?"
2244,JOHN KEATS,"And, little town, thy streets for evermore"
2245,JOHN KEATS,Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
2246,JOHN KEATS,"Why thou art desolate, can e'er return."
2247,JOHN KEATS,
2248,JOHN KEATS,5.
2249,JOHN KEATS,
2250,JOHN KEATS,O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
2251,JOHN KEATS,"Of marble men and maidens overwrought,"
2252,JOHN KEATS,With forest branches and the trodden weed;
2253,JOHN KEATS,"Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought"
2254,JOHN KEATS,As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
2255,JOHN KEATS,"When old age shall this generation waste,"
2256,JOHN KEATS,"Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe"
2257,JOHN KEATS,"Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,"
2258,JOHN KEATS,"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,'--that is all"
2259,JOHN KEATS,"Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

2263,JOHN KEATS,
2264,JOHN KEATS,1.
2265,JOHN KEATS,
2266,JOHN KEATS,"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,"
2267,JOHN KEATS,Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
2268,JOHN KEATS,Conspiring with him how to load and bless
2269,JOHN KEATS,With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
2270,JOHN KEATS,"To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,"
2271,JOHN KEATS,And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
2272,JOHN KEATS,"To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells"
2273,JOHN KEATS,"With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,"
2274,JOHN KEATS,"And still more, later flowers for the bees,"
2275,JOHN KEATS,"Until they think warm days will never cease,"
2276,JOHN KEATS,For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
2277,JOHN KEATS,
2278,JOHN KEATS,2.
2279,JOHN KEATS,
2280,JOHN KEATS,Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
2281,JOHN KEATS,Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
2282,JOHN KEATS,"Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,"
2283,JOHN KEATS,Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
2284,JOHN KEATS,"Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,"
2285,JOHN KEATS,"Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook"
2286,JOHN KEATS,Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
2287,JOHN KEATS,And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
2288,JOHN KEATS,Steady thy laden head across a brook;
2289,JOHN KEATS,"Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,"
2290,JOHN KEATS,Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
2291,JOHN KEATS,
2292,JOHN KEATS,3.
2293,JOHN KEATS,
2294,JOHN KEATS,"Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?"
2295,JOHN KEATS,"Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,--"
2296,JOHN KEATS,"While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,--"
2297,JOHN KEATS,And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
2298,JOHN KEATS,Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
2299,JOHN KEATS,"Among the river sallows, borne aloft"
2300,JOHN KEATS,Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
2301,JOHN KEATS,And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
2302,JOHN KEATS,Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
2303,JOHN KEATS,The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
2304,JOHN KEATS,And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

2310,JOHN KEATS,
2311,JOHN KEATS,"No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist"
2312,JOHN KEATS,"Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;"
2313,JOHN KEATS,Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
2314,JOHN KEATS,"By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;"
2315,JOHN KEATS,"Make not your rosary of yew-berries,"
2316,JOHN KEATS,"Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be"
2317,JOHN KEATS,"Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl"
2318,JOHN KEATS,A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
2319,JOHN KEATS,"For shade to shade will come too drowsily,"
2320,JOHN KEATS,And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
2321,JOHN KEATS,
2322,JOHN KEATS,2.
2323,JOHN KEATS,
2324,JOHN KEATS,But when the melancholy fit shall fall
2325,JOHN KEATS,"Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,"
2326,JOHN KEATS,"That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,"
2327,JOHN KEATS,And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
2328,JOHN KEATS,"Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,"
2329,JOHN KEATS,"Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,"
2330,JOHN KEATS,Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
2331,JOHN KEATS,"Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,"
2332,JOHN KEATS,"Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,"
2333,JOHN KEATS,"And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes."
2334,JOHN KEATS,
2335,JOHN KEATS,3.
2336,JOHN KEATS,
2337,JOHN KEATS,She dwells with Beauty--Beauty that must die;
2338,JOHN KEATS,"And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips"
2339,JOHN KEATS,"Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,"
2340,JOHN KEATS,Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
2341,JOHN KEATS,"Ay, in the very temple of Delight"
2342,JOHN KEATS,"Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,"
2343,JOHN KEATS,Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
2344,JOHN KEATS,Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
2345,JOHN KEATS,"His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,"
2346,JOHN KEATS,And be among her cloudy trophies hung.

2350,JOHN KEATS,
2351,JOHN KEATS,1.
2352,JOHN KEATS,
2353,JOHN KEATS,"Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,"
2354,JOHN KEATS,Alone and palely loitering;
2355,JOHN KEATS,"The sedge is wither'd from the lake,"
2356,JOHN KEATS,And no birds sing.
2357,JOHN KEATS,
2358,JOHN KEATS,2.
2359,JOHN KEATS,
2360,JOHN KEATS,"Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,"
2361,JOHN KEATS,So haggard and so woe-begone?
2362,JOHN KEATS,"The squirrel's granary is full,"
2363,JOHN KEATS,And the harvest's done.
2364,JOHN KEATS,
2365,JOHN KEATS,3.
2366,JOHN KEATS,
2367,JOHN KEATS,"I see a lily on thy brow,"
2368,JOHN KEATS,With anguish moist and fever dew;
2369,JOHN KEATS,And on thy cheek a fading rose
2370,JOHN KEATS,Fast withereth too.
2371,JOHN KEATS,
2372,JOHN KEATS,4.
2373,JOHN KEATS,
2374,JOHN KEATS,I met a lady in the meads
2375,JOHN KEATS,"Full beautiful, a faery's child;"
2376,JOHN KEATS,"Her hair was long, her foot was light,"
2377,JOHN KEATS,And her eyes were wild.
2378,JOHN KEATS,
2379,JOHN KEATS,5.
2380,JOHN KEATS,
2381,JOHN KEATS,"I set her on my pacing steed,"
2382,JOHN KEATS,And nothing else saw all day long;
2383,JOHN KEATS,"For sideways would she lean, and sing"
2384,JOHN KEATS,A faery's song.
2385,JOHN KEATS,
2386,JOHN KEATS,6.
2387,JOHN KEATS,
2388,JOHN KEATS,"I made a garland for her head,"
2389,JOHN KEATS,"And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;"
2390,JOHN KEATS,"She look'd at me as she did love,"
2391,JOHN KEATS,And made sweet moan.
2392,JOHN KEATS,
2393,JOHN KEATS,7.
2394,JOHN KEATS,
2395,JOHN KEATS,"She found me roots of relish sweet,"
2396,JOHN KEATS,"And honey wild, and manna dew;"
2397,JOHN KEATS,"And sure in language strange she said,"
2398,JOHN KEATS,I love thee true.
2399,JOHN KEATS,
2400,JOHN KEATS,8.
2401,JOHN KEATS,
2402,JOHN KEATS,"She took me to her elfin grot,"
2403,JOHN KEATS,"And there she gaz'd and sighed deep,"
2404,JOHN KEATS,And there I shut her wild sad eyes--
2405,JOHN KEATS,So kiss'd to sleep.
2406,JOHN KEATS,
2407,JOHN KEATS,9.
2408,JOHN KEATS,
2409,JOHN KEATS,"And there we slumber'd on the moss,"
2410,JOHN KEATS,"And there I dream'd, ah woe betide,"
2411,JOHN KEATS,The latest dream I ever dream'd
2412,JOHN KEATS,On the cold hill-side.
2413,JOHN KEATS,
2414,JOHN KEATS,10.
2415,JOHN KEATS,
2416,JOHN KEATS,"I saw pale kings, and princes too,"
2417,JOHN KEATS,"Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;"
2418,JOHN KEATS,"Who cry'd--""La belle Dame sans merci"
2419,JOHN KEATS,"Hath thee in thrall!"""
2420,JOHN KEATS,
2421,JOHN KEATS,11.
2422,JOHN KEATS,
2423,JOHN KEATS,I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam
2424,JOHN KEATS,"With horrid warning gaped wide,"
2425,JOHN KEATS,"And I awoke, and found me here"
2426,JOHN KEATS,On the cold hill-side.
2427,JOHN KEATS,
2428,JOHN KEATS,12.
2429,JOHN KEATS,
2430,JOHN KEATS,And this is why I sojourn here
2431,JOHN KEATS,"Alone and palely loitering,"
2432,JOHN KEATS,"Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake,"

2909,XXVII.,Heaven's youngest-teemed star
2910,XXVII.,"Hath fixed her polished car,"
2911,XXVII.,Her sleeping Lord with handmaid-lamp attending;
2912,XXVII.,And all about the courtly stable
2913,XXVII.,Bright-harnessed angels sit in order serviceable.

2916,XXVII.,50. _L'Allegro._
2917,XXVII.,
2918,XXVII.,"Hence, loathed Melancholy!"
2919,XXVII.,"Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born,"
2920,XXVII.,"In Stygian cave forlorn,"
2921,XXVII.,"'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy."
2922,XXVII.,"Find out some uncouth cell,"
2923,XXVII.,"Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings,"
2924,XXVII.,And the night-raven sings;
2925,XXVII.,"There, under ebon shades and low-browed rocks"
2926,XXVII.,"As ragged as thy locks,"
2927,XXVII.,In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.
2928,XXVII.,"But come, thou Goddess fair and free,"
2929,XXVII.,"In Heaven yclept Euphrosynè,"
2930,XXVII.,"And by men, heart-easing Mirth;"
2931,XXVII.,"Whom lovely Venus, at a birth"
2932,XXVII.,"With two sister Graces more,"
2933,XXVII.,To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;
2934,XXVII.,"Or whether, as some sager sing,"
2935,XXVII.,"The frolic wind that breathes the spring,"
2936,XXVII.,"Zephyr, with Aurora playing,"
2937,XXVII.,"As he met her once a-maying,"
2938,XXVII.,"There, on beds of violets blue,"
2939,XXVII.,"And fresh-blown roses washed in dew,"
2940,XXVII.,"Filled her with thee, a daughter fair,"
2941,XXVII.,"So buxom, blithe, and debonair."
2942,XXVII.,"Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee"
2943,XXVII.,"Jest, and youthful Jollity,"
2944,XXVII.,"Quips, and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,"
2945,XXVII.,"Nods and Becks, and wreathed Smiles--"
2946,XXVII.,"Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,"
2947,XXVII.,And love to live in dimple sleek;
2948,XXVII.,"Sport, that wrinkled Care derides,"
2949,XXVII.,"And Laughter, holding both his sides:"
2950,XXVII.,"Come, and trip it as you go"
2951,XXVII.,On the light fantastic toe;
2952,XXVII.,And in thy right hand lead with thee
2953,XXVII.,"The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty;"
2954,XXVII.,"And, if I give thee honour due,"
2955,XXVII.,"Mirth, admit me of thy crew"
2956,XXVII.,"To live with her and live with thee,"
2957,XXVII.,In unreproved pleasures free;
2958,XXVII.,"To hear the lark begin his flight,"
2959,XXVII.,And singing startle the dull night
2960,XXVII.,"From his watch-tower in the skies,"
2961,XXVII.,Till the dappled dawn doth rise;
2962,XXVII.,"Then to come, in spite of sorrow,"
2963,XXVII.,"And at my window bid good-morrow,"
2964,XXVII.,"Through the sweet-briar, or the vine,"
2965,XXVII.,Or the twisted eglantine;
2966,XXVII.,"While the cock, with lively din,"
2967,XXVII.,"Scatters the rear of darkness thin,"
2968,XXVII.,"And, to the stack or the barn-door,"
2969,XXVII.,Stoutly struts his dames before:
2970,XXVII.,Oft listening how the hounds and horn
2971,XXVII.,"Cheerly rouse the slumbering Morn,"
2972,XXVII.,"From the side of some hoar hill,"
2973,XXVII.,Through the high wood echoing shrill.
2974,XXVII.,"Sometime walking, not unseen,"
2975,XXVII.,"By hedgerow elms, on hillocks green,"
2976,XXVII.,"Right against the eastern gate,"
2977,XXVII.,"Where the great Sun begins his state,"
2978,XXVII.,"Robed in flames and amber light,"
2979,XXVII.,The clouds in thousand liveries dight;
2980,XXVII.,"While the ploughman, near at hand,"
2981,XXVII.,"Whistles o'er the furrowed land,"
2982,XXVII.,"And the milkmaid singeth blithe,"
2983,XXVII.,"And the mower whets his scythe,"
2984,XXVII.,"And every shepherd tells his tale,"
2985,XXVII.,Under the hawthorn in the dale.
2986,XXVII.,"Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,"
2987,XXVII.,Whilst the landscape round it measures;
2988,XXVII.,"Russet lawns, and fallows gray,"
2989,XXVII.,"Where the nibbling flocks do stray,"
2990,XXVII.,Mountains on whose barren breast
2991,XXVII.,"The labouring clouds do often rest,"
2992,XXVII.,"Meadows trim with daisies pied,"
2993,XXVII.,"Shallow brooks, and rivers wide,"
2994,XXVII.,"Towers and battlements it sees,"
2995,XXVII.,"Bosomed high in tufted trees,"
2996,XXVII.,"Where perhaps some Beauty lies,"
2997,XXVII.,The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.
2998,XXVII.,Hard by a cottage-chimney smokes
2999,XXVII.,"From betwixt two aged oaks,"
3000,XXVII.,"Where Corydon and Thyrsis, met,"
3001,XXVII.,Are at their savoury dinner set
3002,XXVII.,"Of herbs and other country messes,"
3003,XXVII.,Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;
3004,XXVII.,"And then in haste her bower she leaves,"
3005,XXVII.,With Thestylis to bind the sheaves;
3006,XXVII.,"Or, if the earlier season lead,"
3007,XXVII.,To the tanned haycock in the mead.
3008,XXVII.,"Sometimes, with secure delight,"
3009,XXVII.,"The upland hamlets will invite,"
3010,XXVII.,"When the merry bells ring round,"
3011,XXVII.,"And the jocund rebecks sound,"
3012,XXVII.,"To many a youth and many a maid,"
3013,XXVII.,"Dancing in the chequered shade,"
3014,XXVII.,And young and old come forth to play
3015,XXVII.,"On a sunshine holiday,"
3016,XXVII.,Till the live-long daylight fail;
3017,XXVII.,"Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,"
3018,XXVII.,"With stories told of many a feat,"
3019,XXVII.,How faery Mab the junkets eat;
3020,XXVII.,"She was pinched and pulled, she said;"
3021,XXVII.,"And he, by Friar's lantern led,"
3022,XXVII.,"Tells how the drudging goblin sweat,"
3023,XXVII.,"To earn his cream-bowl duly set,"
3024,XXVII.,"When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,"
3025,XXVII.,His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
3026,XXVII.,That ten day-labourers could not end;
3027,XXVII.,"Then lies him down, the lubber-fiend,"
3028,XXVII.,"And, stretched out all the chimney's length,"
3029,XXVII.,"Basks at the fire his hairy strength,"
3030,XXVII.,"And crop-full out of doors he flings,"
3031,XXVII.,Ere the first cock his matin rings.
3032,XXVII.,"Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,"
3033,XXVII.,By whispering winds soon lulled asleep.
3034,XXVII.,"Towered cities please us then,"
3035,XXVII.,"And the busy hum of men,"
3036,XXVII.,"Where throngs of knights and barons bold,"
3037,XXVII.,"In weeds of peace, high triumphs hold,"
3038,XXVII.,"With store of ladies, whose bright eyes"
3039,XXVII.,"Rain influence, and judge the prize"
3040,XXVII.,"Of wit or arms, while both contend"
3041,XXVII.,"To win her grace, whom all commend."
3042,XXVII.,There let Hymen oft appear
3043,XXVII.,"In saffron robe, with taper clear,"
3044,XXVII.,"And pomp, and feast, and revelry,"
3045,XXVII.,With mask and antique pageantry;
3046,XXVII.,"Such sights as youthful poets dream,"
3047,XXVII.,On summer-eves by haunted stream.
3048,XXVII.,"Then to the well-trod stage anon,"
3049,XXVII.,"If Jonson's learned sock be on,"
3050,XXVII.,"Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,"
3051,XXVII.,Warble his native wood-notes wild.
3052,XXVII.,"And ever, against eating cares,"
3053,XXVII.,"Lap me in soft Lydian airs,"
3054,XXVII.,"Married to immortal verse,"
3055,XXVII.,"Such as the meeting soul may pierce,"
3056,XXVII.,In notes with many a winding bout
3057,XXVII.,"Of linked sweetness long drawn out,"
3058,XXVII.,With wanton heed and giddy cunning
3059,XXVII.,The melting voice through mazes running
3060,XXVII.,Untwisting all the chains that tie
3061,XXVII.,The hidden soul of harmony;
3062,XXVII.,"That Orpheus' self may heave his head,"
3063,XXVII.,From golden slumber on a bed
3064,XXVII.,"Of heaped Elysian flowers, and hear"
3065,XXVII.,Such strains as would have won the ear
3066,XXVII.,"Of Pluto, to have quite set free"
3067,XXVII.,His half-regained Eurydicè.
3068,XXVII.,"These delights if thou canst give,"
3069,XXVII.,"Mirth, with thee I mean to live."

3071,XXVII.,
3072,XXVII.,51. _Il Penseroso._
3073,XXVII.,
3074,XXVII.,"Hence, vain deluding Joys,"
3075,XXVII.,The brood of Folly without father bred!
3076,XXVII.,"How little you bested,"
3077,XXVII.,Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys!
3078,XXVII.,"Dwell in some idle brain,"
3079,XXVII.,"And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,"
3080,XXVII.,As thick and numberless
3081,XXVII.,"As the gay motes that people the sunbeams,"
3082,XXVII.,"Or likest hovering dreams,"
3083,XXVII.,The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train.
3084,XXVII.,"But hail, thou Goddess sage and holy!"
3085,XXVII.,"Hail, divinest Melancholy,"
3086,XXVII.,Whose saintly visage is too bright
3087,XXVII.,"To hit the sense of human sight,"
3088,XXVII.,And therefore to our weaker view
3089,XXVII.,"O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue;"
3090,XXVII.,"Black, but such as in esteem"
3091,XXVII.,"Prince Memnon's sister might beseem,"
3092,XXVII.,Or that starred Ethiop queen that strove
3093,XXVII.,To set her beauty's praise above
3094,XXVII.,"The Sea-Nymphs', and their powers offended:"
3095,XXVII.,Yet thou art higher far descended.
3096,XXVII.,Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore
3097,XXVII.,To solitary Saturn bore;
3098,XXVII.,His daughter she; in Saturn's reign
3099,XXVII.,Such mixture was not held a stain.
3100,XXVII.,Oft in glimmering bowers and glades
3101,XXVII.,"He met her, and in secret shades"
3102,XXVII.,"Of woody Ida's inmost grove,"
3103,XXVII.,While yet there was no fear of Jove.
3104,XXVII.,"Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,"
3105,XXVII.,"Sober, steadfast, and demure,"
3106,XXVII.,"All in a robe of darkest grain,"
3107,XXVII.,"Flowing with majestic train,"
3108,XXVII.,And sable stole of Cyprus lawn
3109,XXVII.,Over thy decent shoulders drawn.
3110,XXVII.,"Come, but keep thy wonted state,"
3111,XXVII.,"With even step, and musing gait,"
3112,XXVII.,"And looks commercing with the skies,"
3113,XXVII.,Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes;
3114,XXVII.,"There, held in holy passion still,"
3115,XXVII.,"Forget thyself to marble, till"
3116,XXVII.,"With a sad, leaden, downward cast"
3117,XXVII.,Thou fix them on the earth as fast.
3118,XXVII.,"And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet,"
3119,XXVII.,"Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,"
3120,XXVII.,And hears the Muses in a ring
3121,XXVII.,Aye round about Jove's altar sing;
3122,XXVII.,"And add to these retired Leisure,"
3123,XXVII.,That in trim gardens takes his pleasure.
3124,XXVII.,"But, first and chiefest, with thee bring"
3125,XXVII.,"Him that yon soars on golden wing,"
3126,XXVII.,"Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,"
3127,XXVII.,The Cherub Contemplation;
3128,XXVII.,"And the mute Silence hist along,"
3129,XXVII.,"'Less Philomel will deign a song,"
3130,XXVII.,"In her sweetest, saddest plight,"
3131,XXVII.,Smoothing the rugged brow of Night;
3132,XXVII.,"While Cynthia checks her dragon-yoke,"
3133,XXVII.,Gently o'er the accustomed oak.
3134,XXVII.,"Sweet bird, that shunnest the noise of folly,"
3135,XXVII.,"Most musical, most melancholy!"
3136,XXVII.,"Thee, chantress, oft the woods among"
3137,XXVII.,I woo to hear thy even-song;
3138,XXVII.,"And missing thee I walk unseen,"
3139,XXVII.,"On the dry, smooth-shaven green,"
3140,XXVII.,"To behold the wandering moon,"
3141,XXVII.,"Riding near her highest noon,"
3142,XXVII.,Like one that has been led astray
3143,XXVII.,"Through the heaven's wide pathless way,"
3144,XXVII.,"And oft, as if her head she bowed,"
3145,XXVII.,Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
3146,XXVII.,"Oft, on a plat of rising ground,"
3147,XXVII.,"I hear the far-off curfew sound,"
3148,XXVII.,"Over some wide-watered shore,"
3149,XXVII.,Swinging slow with sullen roar;
3150,XXVII.,"Or, if the air will not permit,"
3151,XXVII.,"Some still, removed place will fit,"
3152,XXVII.,Where glowing embers through the room
3153,XXVII.,"Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,"
3154,XXVII.,"Far from all resort of mirth,"
3155,XXVII.,"Save the cricket on the hearth,"
3156,XXVII.,"Or the bellman's drowsy charm,"
3157,XXVII.,To bless the doors from nightly harm;
3158,XXVII.,"Or let my lamp, at midnight-hour,"
3159,XXVII.,"Be seen in some high, lonely tower,"
3160,XXVII.,"Where I may oft out-watch the Bear,"
3161,XXVII.,"With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere"
3162,XXVII.,"The spirit of Plato, to unfold"
3163,XXVII.,What worlds or what vast regions hold
3164,XXVII.,"The immortal mind, that hath forsook"
3165,XXVII.,Her mansion in this fleshly nook;
3166,XXVII.,And of those demons that are found
3167,XXVII.,"In fire, air, flood, or underground,"
3168,XXVII.,Whose power hath a true consent
3169,XXVII.,"With planet, or with element."
3170,XXVII.,Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy
3171,XXVII.,"In sceptred pall come sweeping by,"
3172,XXVII.,"Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,"
3173,XXVII.,"Or the tale of Troy divine,"
3174,XXVII.,"Or what, though rare, of later age"
3175,XXVII.,Ennobled hath the buskined stage.
3176,XXVII.,"But, O sad Virgin! that thy power"
3177,XXVII.,"Might raise Musæus from his bower,"
3178,XXVII.,Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
3179,XXVII.,Such notes as warbled to the string
3180,XXVII.,"Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,"
3181,XXVII.,And made Hell grant what love did seek;
3182,XXVII.,Or call up him that left half-told
3183,XXVII.,"The story of Cambuscan bold,"
3184,XXVII.,"Of Camball, and of Algarsife,"
3185,XXVII.,"And who had Canacè to wife,"
3186,XXVII.,That owned the virtuous ring and glass;
3187,XXVII.,"And of the wondrous horse of brass,"
3188,XXVII.,On which the Tartar king did ride;
3189,XXVII.,And if ought else great bards beside
3190,XXVII.,"In sage and solemn tunes have sung,"
3191,XXVII.,"Of tourneys and of trophies hung,"
3192,XXVII.,"Of forests and enchantments drear,"
3193,XXVII.,Where more is meant than meets the ear.
3194,XXVII.,"Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career,"
3195,XXVII.,"Till civil-suited Morn appear,"
3196,XXVII.,"Not tricked and frounced, as she was wont"
3197,XXVII.,"With the Attic boy to hunt,"
3198,XXVII.,"But kerchiefed in a comely cloud,"
3199,XXVII.,"While rocking winds are piping loud,"
3200,XXVII.,"Or ushered with a shower still,"
3201,XXVII.,"When the gust hath blown his fill,"
3202,XXVII.,"Ending on the rustling leaves,"
3203,XXVII.,With minute-drops from off the eaves.
3204,XXVII.,And when the sun begins to fling
3205,XXVII.,"His flaring beams, me, Goddess, bring"
3206,XXVII.,"To arched walks of twilight groves,"
3207,XXVII.,"And shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,"
3208,XXVII.,"Of pine, or monumental oak,"
3209,XXVII.,Where the rude axe with heaved stroke
3210,XXVII.,"Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,"
3211,XXVII.,Or fright them from their hallowed haunt
3212,XXVII.,"There, in close covert by some brook,"
3213,XXVII.,"Where no profaner eye may look,"
3214,XXVII.,"Hide me from day's garish eye,"
3215,XXVII.,"While the bee with honeyed thigh,"
3216,XXVII.,"That at her flowery work doth sing,"
3217,XXVII.,"And the waters murmuring,"
3218,XXVII.,"With such concert as they keep,"
3219,XXVII.,Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep.
3220,XXVII.,"And let some strange, mysterious dream"
3221,XXVII.,"Wave at his wings, in aery stream"
3222,XXVII.,"Of lively portraiture displayed,"
3223,XXVII.,Softly on my eyelids laid;
3224,XXVII.,"And, as I wake, sweet music breathe"
3225,XXVII.,"Above, about, or underneath,"
3226,XXVII.,"Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,"
3227,XXVII.,Or the unseen Genius of the wood.
3228,XXVII.,But let my due feet never fail
3229,XXVII.,"To walk the studious cloisters pale,"
3230,XXVII.,"And love the high embowed roof,"
3231,XXVII.,With antic pillars massy-proof
3232,XXVII.,"And storied windows richly dight,"
3233,XXVII.,Casting a dim religious light.
3234,XXVII.,"There let the pealing organ blow,"
3235,XXVII.,"To the full-voiced quire below,"
3236,XXVII.,"In service high, and anthems clear,"
3237,XXVII.,"As may with sweetness, through mine ear,"
3238,XXVII.,"Dissolve me into ecstasies,"
3239,XXVII.,And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.
3240,XXVII.,And may at last my weary age
3241,XXVII.,"Find out the peaceful hermitage,"
3242,XXVII.,"The hairy gown and mossy cell,"
3243,XXVII.,"Where I may sit, and rightly spell"
3244,XXVII.,"Of every star that heaven doth shew,"
3245,XXVII.,And every herb that sips the dew;
3246,XXVII.,Till old experience do attain
3247,XXVII.,To something like prophetic strain.
3248,XXVII.,"These pleasures, Melancholy, give,"
3249,XXVII.,And I with thee will choose to live.
3250,XXVII.,
3251,XXVII.,
3252,XXVII.,52. _Lycidas._
3253,XXVII.,
3254,XXVII.,"_In this_ Monody _the author bewails a learned friend,"
3255,XXVII.,"unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester, on the Irish Sea,"
3256,XXVII.,"1637; and by occasion foretells the ruin of our corrupted clergy, then"
3257,XXVII.,in their height._
3258,XXVII.,
3259,XXVII.,"Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more"
3260,XXVII.,"Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never-sere,"
3261,XXVII.,"I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,"
3262,XXVII.,And with forced fingers rude
3263,XXVII.,Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.
3264,XXVII.,"Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,"
3265,XXVII.,Compel me to disturb your season due;
3266,XXVII.,"For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,"
3267,XXVII.,"Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer."
3268,XXVII.,Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
3269,XXVII.,"Himself to sing, and build the lofty rime."
3270,XXVII.,He must not float upon his watery bier
3271,XXVII.,"Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,"
3272,XXVII.,Without the meed of some melodious tear.
3273,XXVII.,"Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well,"
3274,XXVII.,That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;
3275,XXVII.,"Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string."
3276,XXVII.,"Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse--"
3277,XXVII.,So may some gentle Muse
3278,XXVII.,"With lucky words favour my destined urn,"
3279,XXVII.,"And as he passes turn,"
3280,XXVII.,And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud--
3281,XXVII.,"For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,"
3282,XXVII.,"Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill;"
3283,XXVII.,"Together both, ere the high lawns appeared"
3284,XXVII.,"Under the opening eyelids of the Morn,"
3285,XXVII.,"We drove a-field, and both together heard"
3286,XXVII.,"What time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn,"
3287,XXVII.,"Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,"
3288,XXVII.,"Oft till the star that rose at evening, bright,"
3289,XXVII.,Toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.
3290,XXVII.,"Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,"
3291,XXVII.,Tempered to the oaten flute;
3292,XXVII.,"Rough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel"
3293,XXVII.,"From the glad sound would not be absent long,"
3294,XXVII.,And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.
3295,XXVII.,"But oh! the heavy change, now thou art gone,"
3296,XXVII.,"Now thou art gone, and never must return!"
3297,XXVII.,"Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves,"
3298,XXVII.,"With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown,"
3299,XXVII.,And all their echoes mourn.
3300,XXVII.,"The willows, and the hazel-copses green,"
3301,XXVII.,Shall now no more be seen
3302,XXVII.,Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.
3303,XXVII.,"As killing as the canker to the rose,"
3304,XXVII.,"Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,"
3305,XXVII.,"Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,"
3306,XXVII.,When first the white-thorn blows;
3307,XXVII.,"Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherds' ear."
3308,XXVII.,"Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep"
3309,XXVII.,Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?
3310,XXVII.,"For neither were ye playing on the steep,"
3311,XXVII.,"Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,"
3312,XXVII.,"Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,"
3313,XXVII.,Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.
3314,XXVII.,"Ay me, I fondly dream!"
3315,XXVII.,Had ye been there ... for what could that have done?
3316,XXVII.,"What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,"
3317,XXVII.,"The Muse herself for her enchanting son,"
3318,XXVII.,"Whom universal Nature did lament,"
3319,XXVII.,"When, by the rout that made the hideous roar,"
3320,XXVII.,"His gory visage down the stream was sent,"
3321,XXVII.,Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?
3322,XXVII.,Alas! what boots it with incessant care
3323,XXVII.,"To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade,"
3324,XXVII.,And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?
3325,XXVII.,"Were it not better done, as others use,"

3327,XXVII.,Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair?
3328,XXVII.,Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
3329,XXVII.,--That last infirmity of noble mind--
3330,XXVII.,"To scorn delights, and live laborious days;"
3331,XXVII.,"But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,"
3332,XXVII.,"And think to burst out into sudden blaze,"
3333,XXVII.,"Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears,"

3346,XXVII.,"But now my oat proceeds,"
3347,XXVII.,"And listens to the herald of the sea,"
3348,XXVII.,That came in Neptune's plea.
3349,XXVII.,"He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,"
3350,XXVII.,What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?
3351,XXVII.,"And questioned every gust of rugged wings,"
3352,XXVII.,That blows from off each beaked promontory.
3353,XXVII.,They knew not of his story;
3354,XXVII.,"And sage Hippotades their answer brings,"
3355,XXVII.,That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed;
3356,XXVII.,"The air was calm, and on the level brine"
3357,XXVII.,Sleek Panopè with all her sisters played.
3358,XXVII.,"It was that fatal and perfidious bark,"
3359,XXVII.,"Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,"
3360,XXVII.,That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
3361,XXVII.,"Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,"
3362,XXVII.,"His mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge,"
3363,XXVII.,"Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge"
3364,XXVII.,Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.
3365,XXVII.,"'Ah! who hath reft,' quoth he, 'my dearest pledge?'"
3366,XXVII.,"Last came, and last did go,"
3367,XXVII.,The pilot of the Galilean lake;
3368,XXVII.,Two massy keys he bore of metals twain--
3369,XXVII.,"The golden opes, the iron shuts amain."
3370,XXVII.,"He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:"
3371,XXVII.,"'How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,"
3372,XXVII.,"Enow of such as, for their bellies' sake,"
3373,XXVII.,"Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold!"
3374,XXVII.,"Of other care they little reckoning make,"
3375,XXVII.,"Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast,"
3376,XXVII.,And shove away the worthy bidden guest.
3377,XXVII.,Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
3378,XXVII.,"A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least"
3379,XXVII.,That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!
3380,XXVII.,What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
3381,XXVII.,"And, when they list, their lean and flashy songs"
3382,XXVII.,Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
3383,XXVII.,"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,"
3384,XXVII.,"But, swollen with wind and the rank mist they draw,"
3385,XXVII.,"Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;"
3386,XXVII.,Beside what the grim wolf with privy paw
3387,XXVII.,"Daily devours apace, and nothing said."
3388,XXVII.,But that two-handed engine at the door
3389,XXVII.,"Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.'"
3390,XXVII.,"Return, Alpheüs, the dread voice is past,"
3391,XXVII.,"That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse,"
3392,XXVII.,"And call the vales, and bid them hither cast"
3393,XXVII.,"Their bells, and flowerets of a thousand hues."
3394,XXVII.,"Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use"
3395,XXVII.,"Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,"
3396,XXVII.,On whose fresh lap the swart-star sparely looks;
3397,XXVII.,"Throw hither all your quaint-enamelled eyes,"
3398,XXVII.,"That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers,"
3399,XXVII.,And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
3400,XXVII.,"Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,"
3401,XXVII.,"The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,"
3402,XXVII.,"The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,"
3403,XXVII.,"The glowing violet,"
3404,XXVII.,"The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,"
3405,XXVII.,"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,"
3406,XXVII.,And every flower that sad embroidery wears;
3407,XXVII.,"Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed,"
3408,XXVII.,"And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,"
3409,XXVII.,To strew the laureate herse where Lycid lies.
3410,XXVII.,"For so, to interpose a little ease,"
3411,XXVII.,"Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise,"
3412,XXVII.,Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
3413,XXVII.,"Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled;"
3414,XXVII.,"Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,"
3415,XXVII.,Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
3416,XXVII.,Visitest the bottom of the monstrous world;
3417,XXVII.,"Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,"
3418,XXVII.,"Sleepest by the fable of Bellerus old,"
3419,XXVII.,Where the great Vision of the guarded mount
3420,XXVII.,Looks towards Namancos and Bayona's hold....
3421,XXVII.,"Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth;"
3422,XXVII.,"And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth."
3423,XXVII.,"Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more,"
3424,XXVII.,"For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,"
3425,XXVII.,Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.
3426,XXVII.,"So sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed,"
3427,XXVII.,"And yet anon repairs his drooping head,"
3428,XXVII.,"And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore"
3429,XXVII.,Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
3430,XXVII.,"So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,"
3431,XXVII.,"Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,"
3432,XXVII.,"Where, other groves and other streams along,"
3433,XXVII.,"With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,"
3434,XXVII.,"And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,"
3435,XXVII.,In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.
3436,XXVII.,"There entertain him all the saints above,"
3437,XXVII.,"In solemn troops, and sweet societies,"
3438,XXVII.,"That sing, and singing in their glory move,"
3439,XXVII.,And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
3440,XXVII.,"Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;"
3441,XXVII.,"Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore,"
3442,XXVII.,"In thy large recompense, and shalt be good"
3443,XXVII.,To all that wander in that perilous flood.
3444,XXVII.,"Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,"
3445,XXVII.,While the still Morn went out with sandals gray;
3446,XXVII.,"He touched the tender stops of various quills,"
3447,XXVII.,With eager thought warbling his Doric lay;
3448,XXVII.,"And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,"
3449,XXVII.,And now was dropped into the western bay.
3450,XXVII.,"At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue;"
3451,XXVII.,"To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new."

3455,XXVII.,
3456,XXVII.,When I consider how my light is spent
3457,XXVII.,"Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,"
3458,XXVII.,"And that one talent, which is death to hide,"
3459,XXVII.,"Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent"
3460,XXVII.,"To serve therewith my Maker, and present"
3461,XXVII.,"My true account, lest He, returning, chide;"
3462,XXVII.,"'Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?'"
3463,XXVII.,"I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent"
3464,XXVII.,"That murmur, soon replies: 'God doth not need"
3465,XXVII.,Either man's work or his own gifts. Who best
3466,XXVII.,"Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state"
3467,XXVII.,"Is kingly. Thousands, at his bidding, speed"
3468,XXVII.,"And post o'er land and ocean, without rest;"
3469,XXVII.,They also serve who only stand and wait.'

5028,96. PART II.--XXXVI.,"I saw her singing at her work,"
5029,96. PART II.--XXXVI.,And o'er the sickle bending;--
5030,96. PART II.--XXXVI.,"I listened, motionless and still;"
5031,96. PART II.--XXXVI.,"And, as I mounted up the hill,"
5032,96. PART II.--XXXVI.,"The music in my heart I bore,"

5043,I.,
5044,I.,"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,"
5045,I.,"The earth, and every common sight,"
5046,I.,To me did seem
5047,I.,"Apparelled in celestial light,"
5048,I.,The glory and the freshness of a dream.
5049,I.,It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
5050,I.,"Turn wheresoe'er I may,"
5051,I.,"By night or day,"
5052,I.,The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
5053,I.,
5054,II.,II.
5055,II.,
5056,II.,"The Rainbow comes and goes,"
5057,II.,"And lovely is the Rose,"
5058,II.,The Moon doth with delight
5059,II.,"Look round her when the heavens are bare,"
5060,II.,Waters on a starry night
5061,II.,Are beautiful and fair;
5062,II.,The sunshine is a glorious birth;
5063,II.,"But yet I know, where'er I go,"
5064,II.,That there hath past away a glory from the earth.
5065,II.,
5066,III.,III.
5067,III.,
5068,III.,"Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,"
5069,III.,And while the young lambs bound
5070,III.,"As to the tabor's sound,"
5071,III.,To me alone there came a thought of grief:
5072,III.,"A timely utterance gave that thought relief,"
5073,III.,And I again am strong:
5074,III.,The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
5075,III.,No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
5076,III.,"I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,"
5077,III.,"The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,"
5078,III.,And all the earth is gay;
5079,III.,Land and sea
5080,III.,"Give themselves up to jollity,"
5081,III.,And with the heart of May
5082,III.,Doth every Beast keep holiday;
5083,III.,"Thou Child of Joy,"
5084,III.,"Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!"
5085,III.,
5086,IV.,IV.
5087,IV.,
5088,IV.,"Ye blessèd Creatures, I have heard the call"
5089,IV.,Ye to each other make; I see
5090,IV.,The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
5091,IV.,"My heart is at your festival,"
5092,IV.,"My head hath its coronal,"
5093,IV.,"The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all."
5094,IV.,O evil day! if I were sullen
5095,IV.,"While Earth herself is adorning,"
5096,IV.,"This sweet May-morning,"
5097,IV.,And the Children are culling
5098,IV.,"On every side,"
5099,IV.,"In a thousand valleys far and wide,"
5100,IV.,"Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,"
5101,IV.,And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:--
5102,IV.,"I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!"
5103,IV.,"--But there's a Tree, of many, one,"
5104,IV.,"A single Field which I have looked upon,"
5105,IV.,Both of them speak of something that is gone:
5106,IV.,The Pansy at my feet
5107,IV.,Doth the same tale repeat:
5108,IV.,Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
5109,IV.,"Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
5110,IV.,
5111,V.,V.
5112,V.,
5113,V.,Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
5114,V.,"The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,"
5115,V.,"Hath had elsewhere its setting,"
5116,V.,And cometh from afar:
5117,V.,"Not in entire forgetfulness,"
5118,V.,"And not in utter nakedness,"
5119,V.,But trailing clouds of glory do we come
5120,V.,"From God, who is our home:"
5121,V.,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
5122,V.,Shades of the prison-house begin to close
5123,V.,"Upon the growing Boy,"
5124,V.,"But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,"
5125,V.,He sees it in his joy;
5126,V.,"The Youth, who daily farther from the east"
5127,V.,"Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,"
5128,V.,And by the vision splendid
5129,V.,Is on his way attended;
5130,V.,"At length the Man perceives it die away,"
5131,V.,And fade into the light of common day.
5132,V.,
5133,VI.,VI.
5134,VI.,
5135,VI.,Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
5136,VI.,"Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,"
5137,VI.,"And, even with something of a Mother's mind,"
5138,VI.,"And no unworthy aim,"
5139,VI.,The homely Nurse doth all she can
5140,VI.,"To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,"
5141,VI.,"Forget the glories he hath known,"
5142,VI.,And that imperial palace whence he came.
5143,VI.,
5144,VII.,VII.
5145,VII.,
5146,VII.,"Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,"
5147,VII.,A six years' Darling of a pigmy size!
5148,VII.,"See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,"
5149,VII.,"Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,"
5150,VII.,With light upon him from his father's eyes!
5151,VII.,"See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,"
5152,VII.,"Some fragment from his dream of human life,"
5153,VII.,Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
5154,VII.,"A wedding or a festival,"
5155,VII.,A mourning or a funeral;
5156,VII.,"And this hath now his heart,"
5157,VII.,And unto this he frames his song:
5158,VII.,Then will he fit his tongue
5159,VII.,"To dialogues of business, love, or strife;"
5160,VII.,But it will not be long
5161,VII.,"Ere this be thrown aside,"
5162,VII.,And with new joy and pride
5163,VII.,The little Actor cons another part;
5164,VII.,Filling from time to time his 'humorous stage'
5165,VII.,"With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,"
5166,VII.,That Life brings with her in her equipage;
5167,VII.,As if his whole vocation
5168,VII.,Were endless imitation.

5174,VIII.,"Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep"
5175,VIII.,"Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,"
5176,VIII.,"That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,"
5177,VIII.,"Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,--"
5178,VIII.,Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!
5179,VIII.,"On whom those truths do rest,"
5180,VIII.,"Which we are toiling all our lives to find,"
5181,VIII.,"In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;"
5182,VIII.,"Thou, over whom thy Immortality"
5183,VIII.,"Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave,"
5184,VIII.,A Presence which is not to be put by;
5185,VIII.,To whom the grave
5186,VIII.,Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
5187,VIII.,"Of day or the warm light,"
5188,VIII.,A place of thought where we in waiting lie;
5189,VIII.,"Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might"
5190,VIII.,"Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height,"
5191,VIII.,Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
5192,VIII.,"The years to bring the inevitable yoke,"
5193,VIII.,Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
5194,VIII.,"Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,"
5195,VIII.,And custom lie upon thee with a weight
5196,VIII.,"Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!"
5197,VIII.,
5198,IX.,IX.
5199,IX.,
5200,IX.,O joy! that in our embers
5201,IX.,"Is something that doth live,"
5202,IX.,That nature yet remembers
5203,IX.,What was so fugitive!
5204,IX.,The thought of our past years in me doth breed
5205,IX.,Perpetual benediction: not indeed
5206,IX.,For that which is most worthy to be blest;
5207,IX.,"Delight and liberty, the simple creed"
5208,IX.,"Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,"
5209,IX.,With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:--
5210,IX.,Not for these I raise
5211,IX.,The song of thanks and praise;
5212,IX.,But for those obstinate questionings
5213,IX.,"Of sense and outward things,"
5214,IX.,"Fallings from us, vanishings;"
5215,IX.,Blank misgivings of a Creature
5216,IX.,"Moving about in worlds not realised,"
5217,IX.,High instincts before which our mortal Nature
5218,IX.,Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised:
5219,IX.,"But for those first affections,"
5220,IX.,"Those shadowy recollections,"
5221,IX.,"Which, be they what they may,"
5222,IX.,"Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,"
5223,IX.,Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
5224,IX.,"Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make"
5225,IX.,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
5226,IX.,"Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,"
5227,IX.,To perish never:
5228,IX.,"Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,"
5229,IX.,"Nor Man nor Boy,"
5230,IX.,"Nor all that is at enmity with joy,"
5231,IX.,Can utterly abolish or destroy!
5232,IX.,Hence in a season of calm weather
5233,IX.,"Though inland far we be,"
5234,IX.,Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
5235,IX.,"Which brought us hither,"
5236,IX.,"Can in a moment travel thither,"
5237,IX.,"And see the Children sport upon the shore,"
5238,IX.,And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
5239,IX.,
5240,X.,X.
5241,X.,
5242,X.,"Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!"
5243,X.,And let the young Lambs bound
5244,X.,As to the tabor's sound!
5245,X.,"We in thought will join your throng,"
5246,X.,"Ye that pipe and ye that play,"
5247,X.,Ye that through your hearts to-day
5248,X.,Feel the gladness of the May!
5249,X.,What though the radiance which was once so bright
5250,X.,"Be now for ever taken from my sight,"
5251,X.,Though nothing can bring back the hour
5252,X.,"Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;"
5253,X.,"We will grieve not, rather find"
5254,X.,Strength in what remains behind;
5255,X.,In the primal sympathy
5256,X.,Which having been must ever be;
5257,X.,In the soothing thoughts that spring
5258,X.,Out of human suffering;
5259,X.,"In the faith that looks through death,"
5260,X.,In years that bring the philosophic mind.

5263,XI.,
5264,XI.,"And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,"

5266,XI.,Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
5267,XI.,I only have relinquished one delight
5268,XI.,To live beneath your more habitual sway.
5269,XI.,"I love the Brooks which down their channels fret,"
5270,XI.,Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
5271,XI.,The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
5272,XI.,Is lovely yet;
5273,XI.,The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
5274,XI.,Do take a sober colouring from an eye
5275,XI.,That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
5276,XI.,"Another race hath been, and other palms are won."
5277,XI.,"Thanks to the human heart by which we live,"
5278,XI.,"Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,"
5279,XI.,To me the meanest flower that blows can give
5280,XI.,Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
