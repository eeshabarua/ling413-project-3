59,PREFACE,PREFACE
60,PREFACE,
61,PREFACE,These selections from the poetry of Robert Browning have been made
62,PREFACE,with especial reference to the tastes and capacities of readers of the
63,PREFACE,high-school age. Every poem included has been found by experience to
64,PREFACE,be within the grasp of boys and girls. Most of Browning's best poetry
65,PREFACE,is within the ken of any reader of imagination and diligence. To the
66,PREFACE,"reader who lacks these, not only Browning, but the great world of"
67,PREFACE,"literature, remains closed: Browning is not the only poet who requires"
68,PREFACE,"close study. The difficulties he offers are, in his best poems, not"
69,PREFACE,more repellent to the thoughtful reader than the nut that protects and
70,PREFACE,"contains the kernel. To a boy or girl of active mind, the difficulty"
71,PREFACE,need rarely be more than a pleasant challenge to the exercise of a
72,PREFACE,little patience and ingenuity.
73,PREFACE,
74,PREFACE,"Browning, when at his best in vigor, clearness, and beauty, is"
75,PREFACE,"peculiarly a poet for young people. His freedom from sentimentality,"
76,PREFACE,"his liveliness of conception and narration, his high optimism, and his"
77,PREFACE,"interest in the things that make for the life of the soul, appeal to"
78,PREFACE,the imagination and the feelings of youth.
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,"The present edition, attempts but little in the way of criticism. The"
81,PREFACE,notes cover such matters as are not readily settled by an appeal to
82,PREFACE,"the dictionary, and suggest, in addition, questions that are designed"
83,PREFACE,to help in interpretation and appreciation.

164,LIFE OF BROWNING,
165,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Robert Browning was born in Camberwell, London, May 7, 1812. He was"
166,LIFE OF BROWNING,"contemporary with Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray, Lowell, Emerson,"
167,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Hawthorne, Darwin, Spencer, Huxley, Dumas, Hugo, Mendelssohn, Wagner,"
168,LIFE OF BROWNING,and a score of other men famous in art and science.
169,LIFE OF BROWNING,
170,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's good fortune began with his birth. His father, a clerk in"
171,LIFE OF BROWNING,"the Bank of England, possessed ample means for the education of his"
172,LIFE OF BROWNING,"children. He had artistic and literary tastes, a mind richly stored"
173,LIFE OF BROWNING,"with philosophy, history, literature, and legend, some repute as a"
174,LIFE OF BROWNING,"maker of verses, and a liberality that led him to assist his gifted"
175,LIFE OF BROWNING,son in following his bent. From his father Robert inherited his
176,LIFE OF BROWNING,literary tastes and his vigorous health; in his father he found a
177,LIFE OF BROWNING,critic and companion. His mother was described by Carlyle as a type
178,LIFE OF BROWNING,"of the true Scotch gentlewoman. Her ""fathomless charity,"" her love of"
179,LIFE OF BROWNING,"music, and her deep religious feeling reappear in the poet."
180,LIFE OF BROWNING,
181,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Free from struggles with adversity, and devoid of public or stirring"
182,LIFE OF BROWNING,"incidents, the story of Browning's life is soon told. It was the life"
183,LIFE OF BROWNING,"of a scholar and man of letters, devoted to the study of poetry,"
184,LIFE OF BROWNING,"philosophy, history; to the contemplation of the lives of men and"
185,LIFE OF BROWNING,women; and to the exercise of his chosen vocation.
186,LIFE OF BROWNING,
187,LIFE OF BROWNING,"His school life was of meagre extent. He attended a private academy,"
188,LIFE OF BROWNING,"read at home under a tutor, and for two years attended the University"
189,LIFE OF BROWNING,of London. When asked in his later life whether he had been to Oxford
190,LIFE OF BROWNING,"or Cambridge, he used to say, ""Italy was my University,"" And, indeed,"
191,LIFE OF BROWNING,his many poems on Italian themes bear testimony to the profound
192,LIFE OF BROWNING,"influence of Italy upon him. In his teens, he came under the influence"
193,LIFE OF BROWNING,"of Pope and Byron, and wrote verses after their styles. Then Shelley"
194,LIFE OF BROWNING,"came by accident in his way, and became to the boy the model of poetic"
195,LIFE OF BROWNING,excellence.
196,LIFE OF BROWNING,
197,LIFE OF BROWNING,"In 1838 appeared his first published poem, _Pauline_. It bears"
198,LIFE OF BROWNING,the marks of his peculiar genius; it has the germs of his merits and
199,LIFE OF BROWNING,"his defects. Though not widely read, it received favorable notice"
200,LIFE OF BROWNING,"from some of the critics. In 1835 appeared _Paracelsus_, in 1837"
201,LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Strafford_, in 1840 _Sordello_. From this time on, for the"
202,LIFE OF BROWNING,"fifty remaining years of his life, his poetic activity hardly ceased,"
203,LIFE OF BROWNING,though his poetry was of uneven excellence. The middle period of his
204,LIFE OF BROWNING,"work, beginning with _Bells and Pomegranates_ in 1842, and"
205,LIFE OF BROWNING,ending with _Balaustion's Adventure_ (a transcript of Euripides'
206,LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Alcestis_) in 1871, was by far the richest in poetic value."
207,LIFE OF BROWNING,
208,LIFE OF BROWNING,"In 1846 he married Elizabeth Barrett, the poet. They left England for"
209,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Italy, where, because of Mrs. Browning's feeble health, they continued"
210,LIFE OF BROWNING,to reside until her death in 1861. The remainder of his life was
211,LIFE OF BROWNING,"divided between England and Italy, with frequent visits to southern"
212,LIFE OF BROWNING,France. His reputation as a poet had steadily grown. He was now one of
213,LIFE OF BROWNING,the best known men in England. His mental activity continued unabated
214,LIFE OF BROWNING,to the end. Within the last thirty years of his life he wrote _The
215,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Ring and the Book_--his longest work, one of the longest and,"
216,LIFE OF BROWNING,"intellectually, one of the greatest, of English poems; translated the"
217,LIFE OF BROWNING,_Agamemnon_ of √Üschylus and the _Alcestis_ of Euripides;
218,LIFE OF BROWNING,published many shorter poems; kept up the studies which had always
219,LIFE OF BROWNING,been his labor and his pastime; and found leisure also to know a wide
220,LIFE OF BROWNING,circle of men and women. William Sharp gives a pleasing picture of the
221,LIFE OF BROWNING,"last years of his life: ""Everybody wished him to come and dine; and he"
222,LIFE OF BROWNING,did his utmost to gratify Everybody. He saw everything; read all the
223,LIFE OF BROWNING,notable books; kept himself acquainted with the leading contents of
224,LIFE OF BROWNING,the journals and magazines; conducted a large correspondence; read
225,LIFE OF BROWNING,"new French, German, and Italian books of mark; read and translated"
226,LIFE OF BROWNING,"Euripides and √Üschylus: knew all the gossip of the literary clubs,"
227,LIFE OF BROWNING,"salons, and the studios; was a frequenter of afternoon tea-parties;"
228,LIFE OF BROWNING,"and then, over and above it, he was Browning: the most profoundly"
229,LIFE OF BROWNING,"subtle mind that has exercised itself in poetry since Shakespeare.""[1]"
230,LIFE OF BROWNING,
231,LIFE OF BROWNING,"He died in Venice, on December 12, 1889, and was buried in the poet's"
232,LIFE OF BROWNING,corner of Westminster Abbey.

238,BROWNING AS POET,
239,BROWNING AS POET,The three generations of readers who have lived since Browning's first
240,BROWNING AS POET,publication have seen as many attitudes taken toward one of the ablest
241,BROWNING AS POET,"poetic spirits of the century. To the first he appeared an enigma, a"
242,BROWNING AS POET,"writer hopelessly obscure, perhaps not even clear in his own mind,"
243,BROWNING AS POET,as to the message he wished to deliver; to the second he appeared a
244,BROWNING AS POET,"prophet and a philosopher, full of all wisdom and subtlety, too deep"
245,BROWNING AS POET,"for common mortals to fathom with line and plummet,--concealing below"
246,BROWNING AS POET,green depths of ocean priceless gems of thought and feeling; to the
247,BROWNING AS POET,"third, a poet full of inequalities in conception and expression, who"
248,BROWNING AS POET,has done many good things well and has made many grave failures.
249,BROWNING AS POET,
250,BROWNING AS POET,No poet in our generation has fared so ill at the hands of the
251,BROWNING AS POET,critics. Already the Browning library is large. Some of the criticism
252,BROWNING AS POET,"is good; much of it, regarding the author as philosopher and"
253,BROWNING AS POET,"symbolist, is totally askew. Reams have been written in interpretation"
254,BROWNING AS POET,"of _Childe Roland_, an imaginative fantasy composed in one day."
255,BROWNING AS POET,Abstruse ideas have been wrested from the simple story of _My Last
256,BROWNING AS POET,Duchess_. His poetry has been the stamping-ground of theologians
257,BROWNING AS POET,and the centre of prattling literary circles. In this tortuous maze of
258,BROWNING AS POET,futile criticism the one thing lost sight of is the fact that a poet
259,BROWNING AS POET,"must be judged by the standards of art. It must be confessed, however,"
260,BROWNING AS POET,that Browning is himself to blame for much of the smoke of commentary
261,BROWNING AS POET,that has gathered round him. He has often chosen the oblique
262,BROWNING AS POET,expression where the direct would serve better; often interpolated
263,BROWNING AS POET,his own musing subtleties between the reader and the life he would
264,BROWNING AS POET,present; often followed his theme into intricacies beyond his own
265,BROWNING AS POET,power to resolve into the simple forms of art. Thus it has come about
266,BROWNING AS POET,"that misguided readers became enigma hunters, and the poet their"
267,BROWNING AS POET,Sphinx.
268,BROWNING AS POET,
269,BROWNING AS POET,"The real question with Browning, as with any poet, is, What is his"
270,BROWNING AS POET,"work and worth as an artist? What of human life has he presented,"
271,BROWNING AS POET,"and how clear and true are his presentations? What passions, what"
272,BROWNING AS POET,"struggles, what ideals, what activities of men has he added to the art"
273,BROWNING AS POET,"world? What beauty and dignity, what light, has he created? How does"
274,BROWNING AS POET,"he view life: with what of hope, or aspiration, or strength? These"
275,BROWNING AS POET,"questions may be discussed under his sense and mastery of form, and"
276,BROWNING AS POET,under his views of human life.
277,BROWNING AS POET,
278,BROWNING AS POET,Browning's sense of form has often been attacked and defended. The
279,BROWNING AS POET,first impression upon reading him is of harshness amounting to the
280,BROWNING AS POET,grotesque. Rhymes often clash and jangle like the music of savages.
281,BROWNING AS POET,Such rhymes as
282,BROWNING AS POET,
283,BROWNING AS POET,"""Fancy the fabric..."
284,BROWNING AS POET,"Ere mortar dab brick,"""
285,BROWNING AS POET,
286,BROWNING AS POET,strain dignity and beauty to the breaking-point. Archaic and bizarre
287,BROWNING AS POET,words are pressed into service to help out the rhyme and metre;
288,BROWNING AS POET,instead of melodic rhythm there are harsh and jolting combinations;
289,BROWNING AS POET,"until the reader brought up in the traditions of Shakespeare, Milton,"
290,BROWNING AS POET,"and Tennyson, is fain to cry out, This is not poetry!"
291,BROWNING AS POET,
292,BROWNING AS POET,"In internal form, as well, Browning often defies the established laws"
293,BROWNING AS POET,"of literature. Distorted and elliptical sentences, long and irrelevant"
294,BROWNING AS POET,"parentheses, curious involutions of thought, and irregular or"
295,BROWNING AS POET,"incoherent development of the narrative or the picture, often leave"
296,BROWNING AS POET,the reader in despair even of the meaning. Nor can these departures
297,BROWNING AS POET,from orderly beauty always be defended by the exigencies of the
298,BROWNING AS POET,subjects. They do not fit the theme. They are the discords of a
299,BROWNING AS POET,musician who either has not mastered his instrument or is not
300,BROWNING AS POET,sensitive to all the finer effects. Some of his work stands out
301,BROWNING AS POET,"clear from these faults: _A Toccata of Galuppi's_, _Love Among the"
302,BROWNING AS POET,"Ruins_, the Songs from _Pippa Passes_, _Apparitions_, _Andrea del"
303,BROWNING AS POET,"Sarto_, and a score of others might be cited to show that Browning"
304,BROWNING AS POET,"could write with a sense of form as true, and an ear as delicate, as"
305,BROWNING AS POET,"could any poet of the century, except Tennyson."
306,BROWNING AS POET,
307,BROWNING AS POET,To Browning belongs the credit of having created a new poetic
308,BROWNING AS POET,"form,--the dramatic monologue. In this form the larger number of his"
309,BROWNING AS POET,poems are cast. Among the best examples in this volume are _My
310,BROWNING AS POET,"Last Duchess_, _The Bishop Orders his Tomb_, _The Laboratory_, and"
311,BROWNING AS POET,"_Confessions_. One person only is speaking, but reveals the"
312,BROWNING AS POET,"presence, action, and thoughts of the others who are in the scene at"
313,BROWNING AS POET,"the same time that he reveals his own character, as in a conversation"
314,BROWNING AS POET,in which but one voice is audible. The dramatic monologue has in a
315,BROWNING AS POET,"peculiar degree the advantages of compression and vividness, and is,"
316,BROWNING AS POET,"in Browning's hands, an instrument of great power."
317,BROWNING AS POET,
318,BROWNING AS POET,The charge of obscurity so often made against Browning's poetry must
319,BROWNING AS POET,in part be admitted. As has been said above he is often led off by his
320,BROWNING AS POET,many-sided interests into irrelevancies and subtleties that interfere
321,BROWNING AS POET,with simplicity and beauty. His compressed style and his fondness
322,BROWNING AS POET,for unusual words often make an unwarranted demand upon the reader's
323,BROWNING AS POET,patience. Such passages are a challenge to his admirers and a repulse
324,BROWNING AS POET,"to the indifferent. Sometimes, indeed, the ore is not worth the"
325,BROWNING AS POET,smelting; often it yields enough to reward the greatest patience.
326,BROWNING AS POET,
327,BROWNING AS POET,"Browning, like all great poets, knew life widely and deeply through"
328,BROWNING AS POET,"men and books. He was born in London, near the great centres of the"
329,BROWNING AS POET,"intellectual movements of his time; he travelled much, especially in"
330,BROWNING AS POET,Italy and France; he read widely in the literatures and philosophies
331,BROWNING AS POET,of many ages and many lands; and so grew into the cosmopolitanism of
332,BROWNING AS POET,spirit that belonged to Chaucer and to Shakespeare.
333,BROWNING AS POET,
334,BROWNING AS POET,In all art human life is the matter of ultimate interest. To Browning
335,BROWNING AS POET,this was so in a peculiar degree. In the epistolary preface to
336,BROWNING AS POET,"_Sordello_, written thirty years after its first publication, he"
337,BROWNING AS POET,"said: ""My stress lay on the incidents in the development of a soul:"
338,BROWNING AS POET,"little else is worth study."" This interest in ""the development of"
339,BROWNING AS POET,"a soul"" is the keynote of nearly all his work. To it are directly"
340,BROWNING AS POET,traceable many of the most obvious excellences and defects of his
341,BROWNING AS POET,poetry. He came to look below the surfaces of things for the soul
342,BROWNING AS POET,"beneath them. He came to be ""the subtlest assertor of the Soul in"
343,BROWNING AS POET,"Song,"" and like his own pair of lovers on the Campagna, ""unashamed of"
344,BROWNING AS POET,"soul."" His early preference of Shelley to Keats indicated this bent."
345,BROWNING AS POET,His readers are conscious always of revelations of the souls of the
346,BROWNING AS POET,men and women he portrays; the sweet and tender womanhood of the
347,BROWNING AS POET,"Duchess, the sordid and material soul of the old Bishop of St."
348,BROWNING AS POET,"Praxed's, the devoted and heroic soul of Napoleon's young soldier, the"
349,BROWNING AS POET,"weary and despairing soul of Andrea del Sarto,--and a host of others"
350,BROWNING AS POET,stand before us cleared of the veil of habit and convention. The
351,BROWNING AS POET,souls of men appear as the victors over all material and immaterial
352,BROWNING AS POET,obstacles. Human affection transforms the bare room to a bower of
353,BROWNING AS POET,fruits and flowers; human courage and resolution carry Childe Roland
354,BROWNING AS POET,"victoriously past the threats and terrors of malignant nature, and"
355,BROWNING AS POET,the despair from accumulated memories of failure; death itself is
356,BROWNING AS POET,"described in _Evelyn Hope_, in _Prospice_, in _Rabbi Ben"
357,BROWNING AS POET,"Ezra_, as a phase, a transit of the soul, wherein the material"
358,BROWNING AS POET,"aspects and the physical terrors disappear. In Browning's poetry, the"
359,BROWNING AS POET,"one real and permanent thing is the world of ideas, the world of the"
360,BROWNING AS POET,spirit. He is in this one of the truest Platonists of modern times.
361,BROWNING AS POET,
362,BROWNING AS POET,To many young readers this method in art comes like a revelation.
363,BROWNING AS POET,Other poets also portray the souls of men; but Browning does it
364,BROWNING AS POET,"more obviously, more intentionally, more insistently. It is well,"
365,BROWNING AS POET,"therefore, to have read Browning. To learn to read him aright is to"
366,BROWNING AS POET,enter the gateway to other good and great poetry.
367,BROWNING AS POET,
368,BROWNING AS POET,"Out of this predominating interest in the souls of men, and out of his"
369,BROWNING AS POET,"intense intellectual activity and scientific curiosity, grows one of"
370,BROWNING AS POET,"Browning's greatest defects. He is often led too far afield, into"
371,BROWNING AS POET,intricacies and anomalies of character beyond the range of common
372,BROWNING AS POET,"experience and sympathy. The criminal, the ""moral idiot,"" belong to"
373,BROWNING AS POET,the alienist rather than to the poet. The abnormalities of nature
374,BROWNING AS POET,have no place in the world of great art; they do not echo the common
375,BROWNING AS POET,experience of mankind. Already the interest is decreasing in that part
376,BROWNING AS POET,of his poetry which deals with such themes. Bishop Blougram and Mr.
377,BROWNING AS POET,Sludge will not take place in the ranks of artistic creations. Nor can
378,BROWNING AS POET,"the poet's ""special pleading"" for such types, however ingenious it"
379,BROWNING AS POET,"may be, whatever philanthropy of soul it may imply, be regarded as"
380,BROWNING AS POET,"justification. Sometimes, indeed, the poet is led by his sympathy and"
381,BROWNING AS POET,his intellectual ingenuity into defences that are inconsistent with
382,BROWNING AS POET,his own standards of the true and the beautiful.
383,BROWNING AS POET,
384,BROWNING AS POET,The trait in Browning which appeals to the largest number of readers
385,BROWNING AS POET,is his strenuous optimism. He will admit no evil or sorrow too
386,BROWNING AS POET,"great to be borne, too irrational to have some ultimate purpose of"
387,BROWNING AS POET,"beneficence. ""There shall never be one lost good,"" says Abt Vogler."
388,BROWNING AS POET,The suicides in the morgue only serve to call forth his declaration:--
389,BROWNING AS POET,
390,BROWNING AS POET,"""My own hope is, a sun will pierce"
391,BROWNING AS POET,The thickest cloud earth ever stretched;
392,BROWNING AS POET,
393,BROWNING AS POET,*       *       *       *       *
394,BROWNING AS POET,
395,BROWNING AS POET,"That what began best can't end worst,"
396,BROWNING AS POET,"Nor what God blessed once, prove accurst."""
397,BROWNING AS POET,
398,BROWNING AS POET,"He has no fear of death; he will face it gladly, in confidence of the"
399,BROWNING AS POET,life beyond. His Grammarian is content to assume an order of things
400,BROWNING AS POET,"which will justify in the next life his ceaseless toil in this, merely"
401,BROWNING AS POET,to learn how to live. Rabbi Ben Ezra's old age is serene in the hope
402,BROWNING AS POET,of the continuity of life and the eternal development of character; he
403,BROWNING AS POET,"finds life good, and the plan of things perfect. In brief, Browning"
404,BROWNING AS POET,"accepts life as it is, and believes it good, piecing out his"
405,BROWNING AS POET,conception of the goodness of life by drawing without limit upon his
406,BROWNING AS POET,hopes of the other world. With the exception of a few poems like
407,BROWNING AS POET,"_Andrea del Sarto_, this is the unbroken tone of his poetry."
408,BROWNING AS POET,"Calvinism, asceticism, pessimism in any form, he rejects. He sustains"
409,BROWNING AS POET,"his position not by argument, but by hope and assertion. It is a"
410,BROWNING AS POET,matter of temperament: he is optimistic because he was born so.
411,BROWNING AS POET,"Different from the serene optimism of Shakespeare's later life, in"
412,BROWNING AS POET,"_The Tempest_ and _The Winter's Tale_, in that it is"
413,BROWNING AS POET,"not, like Shakespeare's, born of long and deep suffering from the"
414,BROWNING AS POET,"contemplation of the tragedies of human life, it bears, in that"
415,BROWNING AS POET,"degree, less of solace and conviction."
416,BROWNING AS POET,
417,BROWNING AS POET,"To Browning's temperament, also, may be ascribed another prominent"
418,BROWNING AS POET,trait in his work. He steadily asserts the right of the individual to
419,BROWNING AS POET,"live out his own life, to be himself in fulfilling his desires and"
420,BROWNING AS POET,aspirations. _The Statue and the Bust_ is the famous exposition
421,BROWNING AS POET,of this doctrine. It is a teaching that neither the poet's optimism
422,BROWNING AS POET,nor his acumen has justified in the minds of men. It is a return to
423,BROWNING AS POET,the unbridled freedom of nature advocated by Whitman and Rousseau;
424,BROWNING AS POET,"an extreme assertion of the value of the individual man, and of"
425,BROWNING AS POET,"unregulated democracy; an outgrowth, it may be, of the robustness and"
426,BROWNING AS POET,"originality of Browning's nature, and interesting--not as a clew to"
427,BROWNING AS POET,"his life, which conformed to that of organized society--but as a"
428,BROWNING AS POET,clew to his independence of classical and conventional forms in the
429,BROWNING AS POET,exercise of his art.
430,BROWNING AS POET,
431,BROWNING AS POET,Creative energy Browning has in high degree. With the poet's insight
432,BROWNING AS POET,"into character and motives, the poet's grasp of the essential laws of"
433,BROWNING AS POET,"human life, the poet's vividness of imagination, he has portrayed a"
434,BROWNING AS POET,"host of types distinct from each other, true to life, strongly marked"
435,BROWNING AS POET,and consistent. With fine dramatic instinct he has shown these
436,BROWNING AS POET,characters in true relation to the facts of life and to each other. In
437,BROWNING AS POET,"this respect he has satisfied the most exigent demands of art, and"
438,BROWNING AS POET,has already taken rank as one of the great creative minds of the
439,BROWNING AS POET,nineteenth century.
440,BROWNING AS POET,
441,BROWNING AS POET,"True poet he is, also, in his depth of feeling and range of sympathy."
442,BROWNING AS POET,"Beneath a ruggedness of intellect, like his landscape in _De"
443,BROWNING AS POET,"Gustibus_, there is always sympathy and tenderness. It is, indeed,"
444,BROWNING AS POET,more like the serenity of Chaucer's emotions than like the tragic
445,BROWNING AS POET,fervor of Shakespeare's. Mrs. Browning's estimate of him in _Lady
446,BROWNING AS POET,"Geraldine's Courtship_,--"
447,BROWNING AS POET,
448,BROWNING AS POET,"""Or from Browning some 'Pomegranate,' which, if cut deep down the middle,"
449,BROWNING AS POET,"Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity,"""
450,BROWNING AS POET,
451,BROWNING AS POET,is true criticism.
452,BROWNING AS POET,
453,BROWNING AS POET,"His love of nature, and his sense of the joy and beauty of it, appear"
454,BROWNING AS POET,often in his poetry; but not with the same insistence as in Wordsworth
455,BROWNING AS POET,"and Burns, and seldom with the same pervasiveness, or with the same"
456,BROWNING AS POET,"beauty, as in Tennyson. He was rather the poet of men's souls. When"
457,BROWNING AS POET,"he does use nature, it is generally to illustrate some phase or"
458,BROWNING AS POET,"experience of the soul, and not for the sake of its beauty. He has,"
459,BROWNING AS POET,"however, some nature-descriptions so exquisite that English poetry"
460,BROWNING AS POET,"would be the poorer for their loss. Witness _De Gustibus_, _Up at a"
461,BROWNING AS POET,"Villa_, _Home Thoughts from Abroad_, _Pippa's Songs_, and _Saul_."
462,BROWNING AS POET,
463,BROWNING AS POET,It is too early to guess at Browning's permanent place in our
464,BROWNING AS POET,"literature. But his vigor of intellect, his insight into the human"
465,BROWNING AS POET,"heart, his originality in phrase and conception, his unquenchable and"
466,BROWNING AS POET,"fearless optimism, and his grasp of the problems of his century, make"
467,BROWNING AS POET,him beyond question one of its greatest figures.

484,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
485,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
486,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,Tennyson has a vivid feeling of the dignity and potency of
487,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"_law_.... Browning vividly feels the importance, the greatness"
488,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"and beauty of passions and enthusiasms, and his imagination"
489,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,is comparatively unimpressed by the presence of law and its
490,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,operations.... It is not the order and regularity in the processes of
491,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"the natural world which chiefly delight Browning's imagination, but"
492,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"the streaming forth of power, and will, and love from the whole face"
493,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,of the visible universe....
494,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
495,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,Tennyson considers the chief instruments of human progress to be a
496,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,vast increase of knowledge and of political organization. Browning
497,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"makes that progress dependent on the production of higher passions,"
498,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"and aspirations,--hopes, and joys, and sorrows; Tennyson finds the"
499,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,evidence of the truth of the doctrine of progress in the universal
500,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,presence of a self-evolving law. Browning obtains his assurance of
501,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"its truth from inward presages and prophecies of the soul, from"
502,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"anticipations, types, and symbols of a higher greatness in store for"
503,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"man, which even now reside within him, a creature ever unsatisfied,"
504,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"ever yearning upward in thought, feeling, and endeavour."
505,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
506,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"... Hence, it is not obedience, it is not submission to the law"
507,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"of duty, which points out to us our true path of life, but rather"
508,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,infinite desire and endless aspiration. Browning's ideal of manhood
509,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,in this world always recognizes the fact that it is the ideal of a
510,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"creature who never can be perfected on earth, a creature whom other"
511,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,and higher lives await in an endless hereafter....
512,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
513,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,The gleams of knowledge which we possess are of chief value because
514,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"they ""sting with hunger for full light."" The goal of knowledge, as of"
515,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"love, is God himself. Its most precious part is that which is least"
516,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,positive--those momentary intuitions of things which eye hath not seen
517,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,nor ear heard. The needs of the highest parts of our humanity cannot
518,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"be supplied by ascertained truth, in which we might rest, or which we"
519,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"might put to use for definite ends; rather by ventures of faith, which"
520,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"test the courage of the soul, we ascend from surmise to assurance, and"
521,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"so again to higher surmise.--Condensed from EDWARD DOWDEN, _Studies"
522,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,in Literature_.
523,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
524,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,... Browning has not cared for that poetic form which bestows
525,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"perennial charm, or else he was incapable of it. He fails in beauty,"
526,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"in concentration of interest, in economy of language, in selection of"
527,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,the best from the common treasure of experience. In those works where
528,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"he has been most indifferent, as in the _Red Cotton Night-Cap"
529,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"Country_, he has been merely whimsical and dull; in those works"
530,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"where the genius he possessed is most felt, as in _Saul_, _A Toccata"
531,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"of Galuppi's_, _Rabbi Ben Ezra_, _The Flight of the Duchess_, _The Bishop"
532,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"Orders his Tomb in Saint Praxed's Church_, _Herv√© Riel_, _Cavalier Tunes_,"
533,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"_Time's Revenges_, and many more, he achieves beauty, or nobility,"
534,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,or fitness of phrase such as only a poet is capable of. It is in these
535,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,last pieces and their like that his fame lies for the future. It
536,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"was his lot to be strong as the thinker, the moralist, with ""the"
537,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"accomplishment of verse,"" the scholar interested to rebuild the past"
538,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"of experience, the teacher with an explicit dogma in an intellectual"
539,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"form with examples from life, the anatomist of human passions,"
540,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"instincts, and impulses in all their gamut, the commentator on his own"
541,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"age; he was weak as the artist, often unnecessarily and by choice, in"
542,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"the repulsive form,--in the awkward, the obscure, the ugly. He belongs"
543,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"with Jonson, with Dryden, with the heirs of the masculine intellect,"
544,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"the men of power not unvisited by grace, but in whom mind is"
545,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"predominant. Upon the work of such poets time hesitates, conscious"
546,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"of their mental greatness, but also of their imperfect art, their"
547,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,heterogeneous matter; at last the good is sifted from that whence
548,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,worth has departed.--From GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY'S _Studies in
549,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,Letters and Life_.
550,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,
551,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,When it is urged that for a poet the intellectual energies are too
552,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"strong in Browning, that for poetry the play of intellectual interests"
553,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"and activities is too great in his work, and that Browning often and"
554,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,at times ruthlessly sacrifices the requirements and effects of art
555,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"for the expression of thought, that ""though he refreshes the heart he"
556,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"tires the brain,"" we should admit this with regard to a good deal of"
557,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,the work of the third period. We should allow that this is the side
558,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"to which he leans generally, but still hold that, though to many his"
559,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"intellectual quality and energy may well seem excessive, yet in great"
560,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,"part of his work, and that of course, his best, the passion of the"
561,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,poet and his kind of imagination are just as fresh and powerful as
562,--WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.,the intellectual force and subtlety are keen and abundant.--JAMES

780,I,By famous Hanover city;
781,I,"The river Weser, deep and wide,"
782,I,Washes its walls on either side;
783,I,A pleasanter spot you never spied;
784,I,"But, when begins my ditty,"
785,I,"Almost five hundred years ago,"
786,I,To see the townsfolk suffer so
787,I,"From vermin, was a pity."

792,II,"They fought the dogs and killed the cats,"
793,II,"And bit the babies in the cradles,"
794,II,"And ate the cheeses out of the vats,"
795,II,"And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,"
796,II,Split open the kegs of salted sprats.
797,II,Made nests inside men's Sunday hats.
798,II,And even spoiled the women's chats
799,II,By drowning their speaking
800,II,With shrieking and squeaking

804,III,
805,III,At last the people in a body
806,III,To the Town Hall came flocking:
807,III,"""'Tis clear,"" cried they, ""our Mayor's a noddy;"
808,III,"And as for our Corporation, shocking"
809,III,To think we buy gowns lined with ermine
810,III,For dolts that can't or won't determine
811,III,What's best to rid us of our vermin!
812,III,"You hope, because you're old and obese,"
813,III,To find in the furry civic robe ease!
814,III,"Rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking                                   30"
815,III,"To find the remedy we're lacking,"
816,III,"Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"""
817,III,At this the Mayor and Corporation
818,III,Quaked with a mighty consternation.
819,III,
820,IV,IV
821,IV,
822,IV,An hour they sat in council;
823,IV,At length the Mayor broke silence:
824,IV,"""For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell,"
825,IV,I wish I were a mile hence!
826,IV,It's easy to bid one rack one's brain--
827,IV,"I'm sure my poor head aches again,                                           40"
828,IV,"I've scratched it so, and all in vain."
829,IV,"Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!"""
830,IV,"Just as he said this, what should hap"
831,IV,At the chamber door but a gentle tap?
832,IV,"""Bless us,"" cried the Mayor, ""what's that?"""
833,IV,"(With the Corporation as he sat,"
834,IV,"Looking little, though wondrous fat;"
835,IV,"Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister"
836,IV,"Than a too-long-opened oyster,"
837,IV,Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous                                   50
838,IV,"For a plate of turtle, green and glutinous)"
839,IV,"""Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?"
840,IV,Anything like the sound of a rat
841,IV,"Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"""
842,IV,
843,V,V
844,V,
845,V,"""Come in!""--the Mayor cried, looking bigger:"
846,V,And in did come the strangest figure!
847,V,His queer long coat from heel to head
848,V,"Was half of yellow and half of red,"
849,V,"And he himself was tall and thin,"
850,V,"With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,                                       60"
851,V,"With light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,"
852,V,"No tuft on cheek, nor beard on chin,"
853,V,But lips where smiles went out and in;
854,V,There was no guessing his kith and kin:
855,V,And nobody could enough admire
856,V,The tall man and his quaint attire.
857,V,"Quoth one: ""It's as my great grandsire,"
858,V,"Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,"
859,V,"Had walked his way from his painted tombstone!"""
860,V,
861,VI,VI
862,VI,
863,VI,He advanced to the council-table:                                            70
864,VI,"And, ""Please your honors,"" said he, ""I'm able,"
865,VI,"By means of a secret charm, to draw"
866,VI,"All creatures living beneath the sun,"
867,VI,"That creep or swim or fly or run,"
868,VI,After me so as you never saw!
869,VI,And I chiefly use my charm
870,VI,"On creatures that do people harm,"
871,VI,The mole and toad and newt and viper;
872,VI,"And people call me the Pied Piper."""
873,VI,(And here they noticed round his neck                                        80
874,VI,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
875,VI,To match with his coat of self-same cheque:
876,VI,And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
877,VI,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying,"
878,VI,As if impatient to be playing
879,VI,"Upon this pipe, as low it dangled"
880,VI,Over his vesture so old-fangled.)
881,VI,"""Yet,"" said he, ""poor piper as I am,"
882,VI,"In Tartary I freed the Cham,¬∞                                               ¬∞89"
883,VI,"Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;                                    90"
884,VI,I eased in Asia the Nizam¬∞                                                  ¬∞91
885,VI,Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats:
886,VI,"And as for what your brain bewilders,"
887,VI,If I can rid your town of rats
888,VI,"Will you give me a thousand guilders?"""
889,VI,"""One? fifty thousand!""--was the exclamation"
890,VI,Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
891,VI,
892,VII,VII
893,VII,
894,VII,"Into the street the Piper stept,"
895,VII,"Smiling first a little smile,"
896,VII,As if he knew what magic slept                                              100
897,VII,In his quiet pipe the while:
898,VII,"Then, like a musical adept,"
899,VII,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
900,VII,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
901,VII,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
902,VII,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,"
903,VII,You heard as if an army muttered:
904,VII,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
905,VII,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
906,VII,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.                               110
907,VII,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"
908,VII,"Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,"
909,VII,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
910,VII,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
911,VII,"Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,"
912,VII,"Families by tens and dozens,"
913,VII,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--"
914,VII,Followed the Piper for their lives.
915,VII,"From street to street he piped advancing,"
916,VII,"And step for step they followed dancing,                                    120"
917,VII,"Until they came to the river Weser,"
918,VII,Wherein all plunged and perished!
919,VII,"--Save one, who, stout as Julius C√¶sar,"
920,VII,Swam across and lived to carry
921,VII,"(As he, the manuscript he cherished)"
922,VII,To Rat-land home his commentary:
923,VII,"Which was: ""At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
924,VII,"I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,"
925,VII,"And putting apples, wondrous ripe,"
926,VII,Into a cider press's gripe;                                                 130
927,VII,"And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,"
928,VII,"And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,"
929,VII,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,"
930,VII,And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:
931,VII,And it seemed as if a voice
932,VII,(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
933,VII,"Is breathed) called out, 'Oh, rats, rejoice!"
934,VII,The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
935,VII,"So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,"
936,VII,"Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'                                       140"
937,VII,"And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,"
938,VII,"Already staved, like a great sun shone"
939,VII,"Glorious scarce an inch before me,"
940,VII,"Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'"
941,VII,"--I found the Weser rolling o'er me."""
942,VII,
943,VIII,VIII
944,VIII,
945,VIII,You should have heard the Hamelin people
946,VIII,Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.
947,VIII,"""Go,"" cried the Mayor, ""and get long poles,"
948,VIII,Poke out the nests and block up the holes!
949,VIII,"Consult with carpenters and builders,                                       150"
950,VIII,"And leave in our town, not even a trace"
951,VIII,"Of the rats!""--when suddenly, up the face"
952,VIII,"Of the Piper perked in the market-place,"
953,VIII,"With a, ""First, if you please, my thousand guilders!"""
954,VIII,
955,IX,IX
956,IX,
957,IX,A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;
958,IX,"So did the Corporation, too."
959,IX,For council dinners made rare havoc
960,IX,"With Claret,¬∞ Moselle,¬∞ Vin-de-Grave,¬∞ Hock¬∞;                              ¬∞158"
961,IX,And half the money would replenish
962,IX,Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish¬∞.                                 ¬∞160
963,IX,To pay this sum to a wandering fellow
964,IX,With a gypsy coat of red and yellow!
965,IX,"""Beside,"" quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,"
966,IX,"""Our business was done at the river's brink;"
967,IX,"We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,"
968,IX,"And what's dead can't come to life, I think."
969,IX,"So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink"
970,IX,"From the duty of giving you something for drink,"
971,IX,And a matter of money to put in your poke;
972,IX,"But as for the guilders, what we spoke                                      170"
973,IX,"Of them, as you very well know, was in joke."
974,IX,"Beside, our losses have made us thrifty."
975,IX,"A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!"""
976,IX,
977,X,X
978,X,
979,X,"The Piper's face fell, and he cried,"
980,X,"""No trifling! I can't wait! Beside,"
981,X,I've promised to visit by dinner-time
982,X,"Bagdat, and accept the prime"
983,X,"Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,"
984,X,"For having left, in the Caliph's¬∞ kitchen,                                 ¬∞179"
985,X,Of a nest of scorpions no survivor:                                         180
986,X,"With him I proved no bargain-driver,"
987,X,"With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!"
988,X,And folks who put me in a passion
989,X,"May find me pipe after another fashion."""
990,X,
991,XI,XI
992,XI,
993,XI,"""How?"" cried the Mayor, ""d'ye think I brook"
994,XI,Being worse treated than a cook?
995,XI,Insulted by a lazy ribald
996,XI,With idle pipe and vesture piebald?
997,XI,"You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst!"
998,XI,"Blow your pipe there till you burst!""                                       190"
999,XI,
1000,XII,XII
1001,XII,
1002,XII,"Once more he stept into the street,"
1003,XII,And to his lips again
1004,XII,Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
1005,XII,"And ere he blew three notes (such sweet,"
1006,XII,Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
1007,XII,Never gave the enraptured air)
1008,XII,There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
1009,XII,Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;
1010,XII,"Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,                         200"
1011,XII,"Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,"
1012,XII,"And, like fowls in a farm-yard, when barley is scattering,"
1013,XII,Out came the children running.
1014,XII,All the little boys and girls.
1015,XII,"With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,"
1016,XII,"And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,"
1017,XII,"Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after"
1018,XII,The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
1019,XII,
1020,XIII,XIII
1021,XIII,
1022,XIII,"The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood"
1023,XIII,As if they were changed into blocks of wood.
1024,XIII,"Unable to move a step, or cry                                               210"
1025,XIII,"To the children merrily skipping by,"
1026,XIII,--Could only follow with the eye
1027,XIII,That joyous crowd at the piper's back.
1028,XIII,"But how the Mayor was on the rack,"
1029,XIII,"And the wretched Council's bosom beat,"
1030,XIII,As the Piper turned from the High Street
1031,XIII,"To where the Weser rolled its waters,"
1032,XIII,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
1033,XIII,"However, he turned from South to West,"
1034,XIII,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,                                 220"
1035,XIII,And after him the children pressed:
1036,XIII,Great was the joy in every breast.
1037,XIII,"""He never can cross that mighty top!"
1038,XIII,"He's forced to let the piping drop,"
1039,XIII,"And we shall see our children stop."""
1040,XIII,"When lo, as they reached the mountain-side,"
1041,XIII,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
1042,XIII,As if a cavern were suddenly hollowed;
1043,XIII,"And the Piper advanced, and the children followed,"
1044,XIII,"And when all were in, to the very last,                                     230"
1045,XIII,The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
1046,XIII,"Did I say all? No! One was lame,"
1047,XIII,And could not dance the whole of the way;
1048,XIII,"And in after years, if you would blame"
1049,XIII,"His sadness, he was used to say,--"
1050,XIII,"""It's dull in our town since my playmates left!"
1051,XIII,I can't forget that I'm bereft
1052,XIII,"Of all the pleasant sights they see,"
1053,XIII,Which the Piper also promised me.
1054,XIII,"For he led us, he said, to a joyous land.                                   240"
1055,XIII,"Joining the town, and just at hand,"
1056,XIII,"Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,"
1057,XIII,"And flowers put forth a fairer hue,"
1058,XIII,And everything was strange and new:
1059,XIII,"The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,"
1060,XIII,And their dogs outran our fallow deer.
1061,XIII,"And honey-bees had lost their stings,"
1062,XIII,And horses were born with eagles' wings;
1063,XIII,"And just as I became assured,"
1064,XIII,"My lame foot would be speedily cured,                                       250"
1065,XIII,"The music stopped and I stood still,"
1066,XIII,"And found myself outside the hill,"
1067,XIII,"Left alone against my will,"
1068,XIII,To go now limping as before.
1069,XIII,"And never hear of that country more!"""
1070,XIII,
1071,XIV,XIV
1072,XIV,
1073,XIV,"Alas, alas for Hamelin!"
1074,XIV,There came into many a burgher's pate
1075,XIV,A text which says that Heaven's gate
1076,XIV,Opes to the rich at as easy a rate
1077,XIV,As the needle's eye takes a camel in!                                       260
1078,XIV,"The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,"
1079,XIV,"To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,"
1080,XIV,"Wherever it was men's lot to find him,"
1081,XIV,"Silver and gold to his heart's content,"
1082,XIV,"If he'd only return the way he went,"
1083,XIV,And bring the children behind him.
1084,XIV,"But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,"
1085,XIV,"And Piper and dancers were gone forever,"
1086,XIV,They made a decree that lawyers never
1087,XIV,Should think their records dated duly                                     270
1088,XIV,"If, after the day of the month and year,"
1089,XIV,"These words did not as well appear,"
1090,XIV,"""And so long after what happened here"
1091,XIV,"On the twenty-second of July,"
1092,XIV,"Thirteen hundred and seventy-six;"""
1093,XIV,And the better in memory to fix
1094,XIV,"The place of the children's last retreat,"
1095,XIV,They called it the Pied Piper's Street--
1096,XIV,Where any one playing on pipe or tabor
1097,XIV,Was sure for the future to lose his labour.                                 280
1098,XIV,Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
1099,XIV,To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
1100,XIV,But opposite the place of the cavern
1101,XIV,"They wrote the story on a column,"
1102,XIV,And on the great church window painted
1103,XIV,"The same, to make the world acquainted"
1104,XIV,How their children were stolen away.
1105,XIV,And there it stands to this very day.
1106,XIV,And I must not omit to say

3254,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Much less cry out, but stooped apart,"

3257,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,A wild bush grows and hides my crypt;

3264,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"An hour, and she returned alone"

3269,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Which, when 'twas told her, could not fail"
3270,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Persuade a peasant of its truth;
3271,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I meant to call a freak of youth
3272,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"This hiding, and give hopes of pay,"
3273,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And no temptation to betray.
3274,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"But when I saw that woman's face,"
3275,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Its calm simplicity of grace,"
3276,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Our Italy's own attitude
3277,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"In which she walked thus far, and stood,                                     60"

3338,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Real wishes on myself--say, three--"

3340,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I would grasp Metternich until
3341,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I felt his red wet throat distil
3342,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"In blood thro' these two hands. And next,"
3343,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,--Nor much for that am I perplexed--
3344,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Charles, perjured traitor, for his part,"
3345,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Should die slow of a broken heart
3346,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Under his new employers. Last
3347,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"--Ah, there, what should I wish? For fast"
3348,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Do I grow old and out of strength.
3349,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,If I resolved to seek at length                                             130

3366,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Over the sea the thousand miles,"

3374,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Her children's ages and their names,"
3375,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And what may be the husband's aims
3376,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"For each of them. I'd talk this out,"

3399,FERRARA,"Strangers like you that pictured countenance,"
3400,FERRARA,"The depth and passion of its earnest glance,"

3413,FERRARA,For calling up that spot of joy. She had
3414,FERRARA,"A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,"

3416,FERRARA,"She looked on, and her looks went everywhere."
3417,FERRARA,"Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,"

3420,FERRARA,"Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule"

3424,FERRARA,Somehow--I know not how--as if she ranked
3425,FERRARA,My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name

3433,FERRARA,"Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,"
3434,FERRARA,--E'en then would be some stooping: and I choose
3435,FERRARA,"Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,"
3436,FERRARA,Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
3437,FERRARA,Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;

5829,XV,Thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine--
5830,XV,"And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign?"
5831,XV,"I yearned--""Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss,"
