69,THE DEFEAT OF YOUTH,
70,THE DEFEAT OF YOUTH,
71,I. UNDER THE TREES.,I. UNDER THE TREES.
72,I. UNDER THE TREES.,
73,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"There had been phantoms, pale-remembered shapes"
74,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"Of this and this occasion, sisterly"
75,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"In their resemblances, each effigy"
76,I. UNDER THE TREES.,Crowned with the same bright hair above the nape's
77,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"White rounded firmness, and each body alert"
78,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"With such swift loveliness, that very rest"
79,I. UNDER THE TREES.,Seemed a poised movement: ... phantoms that impressed
80,I. UNDER THE TREES.,But a faint influence and could bless or hurt
81,I. UNDER THE TREES.,No more than dreams. And these ghost things were she;
82,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"For formless still, without identity,"
83,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"Not one she seemed, not clear, but many and dim."
84,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"One face among the legions of the street,"
85,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"Indifferent mystery, she was for him"
86,I. UNDER THE TREES.,"Something still uncreated, incomplete."
87,I. UNDER THE TREES.,
88,I. UNDER THE TREES.,
89,II.,II.
90,II.,
91,II.,Bright windy sunshine and the shadow of cloud
92,II.,Quicken the heavy summer to new birth
93,II.,Of life and motion on the drowsing earth;
94,II.,"The huge elms stir, till all the air is loud"
95,II.,With their awakening from the muffled sleep
96,II.,Of long hot days. And on the wavering line
97,II.,"That marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine,"
98,II.,"Under the trees, a little group is deep"
99,II.,In laughing talk. The shadow as it flows
100,II.,"Across them dims the lustre of a rose,"
101,II.,"Quenches the bright clear gold of hair, the green"
102,II.,"Of a girl's dress, and life seems faint. The light"
103,II.,"Swings back, and in the rose a fire is seen,"
104,II.,Gold hair's aflame and green grows emerald bright.
105,II.,
106,II.,
107,III.,III.
108,III.,
109,III.,"She leans, and there is laughter in the face"
110,III.,She turns towards him; and it seems a door
111,III.,Suddenly opened on some desolate place
112,III.,With a burst of light and music. What before
113,III.,Was hidden shines in loveliness revealed.
114,III.,"Now first he sees her beautiful, and knows"
115,III.,That he must love her; and the doom is sealed
116,III.,Of all his happiness and all the woes
117,III.,That shall be born of pregnant years hereafter.
118,III.,"The swift poise of a head, a flutter of laughter--"
119,III.,"And love flows in on him, its vastness pent"
120,III.,"Within his narrow life: the pain it brings,"
121,III.,Boundless; for love is infinite discontent
122,III.,With the poor lonely life of transient things.
123,III.,
124,III.,
125,IV.,IV.
126,IV.,
127,IV.,"Men see their god, an immanence divine,"
128,IV.,"Smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay,"
129,IV.,In bare ploughed lands that go sloping away
130,IV.,To meet the sky in one clean exquisite line.
131,IV.,Out of the short-seen dawns of ecstasy
132,IV.,"They draw new beauty, whence new thoughts are born"
133,IV.,"And in their turn conceive, as grains of corn"
134,IV.,Germ and create new life and endlessly
135,IV.,Shall live creating. Out of earthly seeds
136,IV.,Springs the aerial flower. One spirit proceeds
137,IV.,"Through change, the same in body and in soul--"
138,IV.,The spirit of life and love that triumphs still
139,IV.,In its slow struggle towards some far-off goal
140,IV.,Through lust and death and the bitterness of will.
141,IV.,
142,IV.,
143,V.,V.
144,V.,
145,V.,One spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep
146,V.,"Of human minds, that shakes the elms in storm,"
147,V.,"That sings in passionate music, or on warm"
148,V.,Still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep
149,V.,Of thistle-seeds that wait a travelling wind.
150,V.,One spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought
151,V.,And the long thundering seas; the soul is wrought
152,V.,Of one stuff with the body--matter and mind
153,V.,Woven together in so close a mesh
154,V.,"That flowers may blossom into a song, that flesh"
155,V.,May strangely teach the loveliest holiest things
156,V.,To watching spirits. Truth is brought to birth
157,V.,Not in some vacant heaven: its beauty springs
158,V.,From the dear bosom of material earth.
159,V.,
160,V.,
161,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.
162,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,
163,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,The darkness in the loft is sweet and warm
164,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,With the stored hay ... darkness intensified
165,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,By one bright shaft that enters through the wide
166,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,Tall doors from under fringes of a storm
167,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,"Which makes the doomed sun brighter. On the hay,"
168,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,"Perched mountain-high they sit, and silently"
169,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,Watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky
170,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,And mark how heartbreakingly far away
171,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,"And yet how close and clear the distance seems,"
172,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,While all at hand is cloud--brightness of dreams
173,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,"Unrealisable, yet seen so clear,"
174,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,"So only just beyond the dark. They wait,"
175,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,"Scarce knowing what they wait for, half in fear;"
176,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,Expectance draws the curtain from their fate.
177,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,
178,VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.,
179,VII.,VII.
180,VII.,
181,VII.,The silence of the storm weighs heavily
182,VII.,On their strained spirits: sometimes one will say
183,VII.,Some trivial thing as though to ward away
184,VII.,"Mysterious powers, that imminently lie"
185,VII.,"In wait, with the strong exorcising grace"
186,VII.,Of everyday's futility. Desire
187,VII.,"Becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire,"
188,VII.,"Defined and hard:--If he could kiss her face,"
189,VII.,"Could kiss her hair! As if by chance, her hand"
190,VII.,"Brushes on his ... Ah, can she understand?"
191,VII.,Or is she pedestalled above the touch
192,VII.,Of his desire? He wonders: dare he seek
193,VII.,"From her that little, that infinitely much?"
194,VII.,And suddenly she kissed him on the cheek.
195,VII.,
196,VII.,
197,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,VIII. MOUNTAINS.
198,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,
199,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,A stronger gust catches the cloud and twists
200,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"A spindle of rifted darkness through its heart,"
201,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"A gash in the damp grey, which, thrust apart,"
202,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,Reveals black depths a moment. Then the mists
203,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,Shut down again; a white uneasy sea
204,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,Heaves round the climbers and beneath their feet.
205,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"He strains on upwards through the wind and sleet,"
206,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"Poised, or swift moving, or laboriously"
207,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"Lifting his weight. And if he should let go,"
208,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"What would he find down there, down there below"
209,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,The curtain of the mist? What would he find
210,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"Beyond the dim and stifling now and here,"
211,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,Beneath the unsettled turmoil of his mind?
212,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,"Oh, there were nameless depths: he shrank with fear."
213,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,
214,VIII. MOUNTAINS.,
215,IX.,IX.
216,IX.,
217,IX.,The hills more glorious in their coat of snow
218,IX.,"Rise all around him, in the valleys run"
219,IX.,"Bright streams, and there are lakes that catch the sun,"
220,IX.,And sunlit fields of emerald far below
221,IX.,That seem alive with inward light. In smoke
222,IX.,The far horizons fade; and there is peace
223,IX.,"On everything, a sense of blessed release"
224,IX.,From wilful strife. Like some prophetic cloak
225,IX.,The spirit of the mountains has descended
226,IX.,"On all the world, and its unrest is ended."
227,IX.,"Even the sea, glimpsed far away, seems still,"
228,IX.,Hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife.
229,IX.,"Mountains of vision, calm above fate and will,"
230,IX.,You hold the promise of the freer life.

233,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.
234,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,
235,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,London unfurls its incense-coloured dusk
236,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"Before the panes, rich but a while ago"
237,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,With the charred gold and the red ember-glow
238,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,Of dying sunset. Houses quit the husk
239,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"Of secrecy, which, through the day, returns"
240,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,A blank to all enquiry: but at nights
241,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,The cheerfulness of fire and lamp invites
242,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"The darkness inward, curious of what burns"
243,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,With such a coloured life when all is dead--
244,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"The daylight world outside, with overhead"
245,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"White clouds, and where we walk, the blaze"
246,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"Of wet and sunlit streets, shops and the stream"
247,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"Of glittering traffic--all that the nights erase,"
248,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,"Colour and speed, surviving but in dream."
249,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,
250,X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.,
251,XI.,XI.
252,XI.,
253,XI.,"Outside the dusk, but in the little room"
254,XI.,"All is alive with light, which brightly glints"
255,XI.,"On curving cup or the stiff folds of chintz,"
256,XI.,"Evoking its own whiteness. Shadows loom,"
257,XI.,"Bulging and black, upon the walls, where hang"
258,XI.,Rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal
259,XI.,"Less to the sense of sight than to the feel,"
260,XI.,"So moistly satin are their breasts. A pang,"
261,XI.,"Almost of pain, runs through him when he sees"
262,XI.,"Hanging, a homeless marvel, next to these,"
263,XI.,"The silken breastplate of a mandarin,"
264,XI.,"Centuries dead, which he had given her."
265,XI.,"Exquisite miracle, when men could spin"
266,XI.,Jay's wing and belly of the kingfisher!
267,XI.,
268,XI.,
269,XII.,XII.
270,XII.,
271,XII.,In silence and as though expectantly
272,XII.,"She crouches at his feet, while he caresses"
273,XII.,His light-drawn fingers with the touch of tresses
274,XII.,"Sleeked round her head, close-banded lustrously,"
275,XII.,Save where at nape and temple the smooth brown
276,XII.,Sleaves out into a pale transparent mist
277,XII.,"Of hair and tangled light. So to exist,"
278,XII.,Poised 'twixt the deep of thought where spirits drown
279,XII.,"Life in a void impalpable nothingness,"
280,XII.,"And, on the other side, the pain and stress"
281,XII.,Of clamorous action and the gnawing fire
282,XII.,"Of will, focal upon a point of earth--even thus"
283,XII.,"To sit, eternally without desire"
284,XII.,"And yet self-known, were happiness for us."
285,XII.,
286,XII.,
287,XIII.,XIII.
288,XIII.,
289,XIII.,She turns her head and in a flash of laughter
290,XIII.,Looks up at him: and helplessly he feels
291,XIII.,That life has circled with returning wheels
292,XIII.,Back to a starting-point. Before and after
293,XIII.,"Merge in this instant, momently the same:"
294,XIII.,For it was thus she leaned and laughing turned
295,XIII.,"When, manifest, the spirit of beauty burned"
296,XIII.,"In her young body with an inward flame,"
297,XIII.,And first he knew and loved her. In full tide
298,XIII.,"Life halts within him, suddenly stupefied."
299,XIII.,"Sight blackness, lightning-struck; but blindly tender"
300,XIII.,"He draws her up to meet him, and she lies"
301,XIII.,"Close folded by his arms in glad surrender,"
302,XIII.,"Smiling, and with drooped head and half closed eyes."
303,XIII.,
304,XIII.,
305,XIV.,XIV.
306,XIV.,
307,XIV.,"""I give you all; would that I might give more."""
308,XIV.,He sees the colour dawn across her cheeks
309,XIV.,And die again to white; marks as she speaks
310,XIV.,"The trembling of her lips, as though she bore"
311,XIV.,Some sudden pain and hardly mastered it.
312,XIV.,"Within his arms he feels her shuddering,"
313,XIV.,Piteously trembling like some wild wood-thing
314,XIV.,Caught unawares. Compassion infinite
315,XIV.,Mounts up within him. Thus to hold and keep
316,XIV.,"And comfort her distressed, lull her to sleep"
317,XIV.,And gently kiss her brow and hair and eyes
318,XIV.,Seems love perfected--templed high and white
319,XIV.,"Against the calm of golden autumn skies,"
320,XIV.,And shining quenchlessly with vestal light.
321,XIV.,
322,XIV.,
323,XV.,XV.
324,XV.,
325,XV.,But passion ambushed by the aerial shrine
326,XV.,"Comes forth to dance, a hoofed obscenity,"
327,XV.,"His satyr's dance, with laughter in his eye,"
328,XV.,And cruelty along the scarlet line
329,XV.,"Of his bright smiling mouth. All uncontrolled,"
330,XV.,"Love's rebel servant, he delights to beat"
331,XV.,The maddening quick dry rhythm of goatish feet
332,XV.,"Even in the sanctuary, and makes bold"
333,XV.,To mime himself the godhead of the place.
334,XV.,"He turns in terror from her trance-calmed face,"
335,XV.,"From the white-lidded languor of her eyes,"
336,XV.,"From lips that passion never shook before,"
337,XV.,But glad in the promise of her sacrifice:
338,XV.,"""I give you all; would that I might give more."""
339,XV.,
340,XV.,
341,XVI.,XVI.
342,XVI.,
343,XVI.,"He is afraid, seeing her lie so still,"
344,XVI.,So utterly his own; afraid lest she
345,XVI.,Should open wide her eyes and let him see
346,XVI.,The passionate conquest of her virgin will
347,XVI.,"Shine there in triumph, starry-bright with tears."
348,XVI.,"He thrusts her from him: face and hair and breast,"
349,XVI.,"Hands he had touched, lips that his lips had pressed,"
350,XVI.,Seem things deadly to be desired. He fears
351,XVI.,Lest she should body forth in palpable shame
352,XVI.,"Those dreams and longings that his blood, aflame"
353,XVI.,"Through the hot dark of summer nights, had dreamed"
354,XVI.,"And longed. Must all his love, then, turn to this?"
355,XVI.,Was lust the end of what so pure had seemed?
356,XVI.,"He must escape, ah God! her touch, her kiss."
357,XVI.,

360,XVII. IN THE PARK.,
361,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Laughing, ""To-night,"" I said to him, ""the Park"
362,XVII. IN THE PARK.,Has turned the garden of a symbolist.
363,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Those old great trees that rise above the mist,"
364,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Gold with the light of evening, and the dark"
365,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Still water, where the dying sun evokes"
366,XVII. IN THE PARK.,An echoed glory--here I recognize
367,XVII. IN THE PARK.,Those ancient gardens mirrored by the eyes
368,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Of poets that hate the world of common folks,"
369,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Like you and me and that thin pious crowd,"
370,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Which yonder sings its hymns, so humbly proud"
371,XVII. IN THE PARK.,Of holiness. The garden of escape
372,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Lies here; a small green world, and still the bride"
373,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Of quietness, although an imminent rape"
374,XVII. IN THE PARK.,"Roars ceaselessly about on every side."""

377,XVIII.,XVIII.
378,XVIII.,
379,XVIII.,"I had forgotten what I had lightly said,"
380,XVIII.,"And without speech, without a thought I went,"
381,XVIII.,"Steeped in that golden quiet, all content"
382,XVIII.,To drink the transient beauty as it sped
383,XVIII.,Out of eternal darkness into time
384,XVIII.,To light and burn and know itself a fire;
385,XVIII.,"Yet doomed--ah, fate of the fulfilled desire!--"
386,XVIII.,"To fade, a meteor, paying for the crime"
387,XVIII.,Of living glorious in the denser air
388,XVIII.,"Of our material earth. A strange despair,"
389,XVIII.,"An agony, yet strangely, subtly sweet"
390,XVIII.,"And tender as an unpassionate caress,"
391,XVIII.,Filled me ... Oh laughter! youth's conceit
392,XVIII.,Grown almost conscious of youth's feebleness!

397,XIX.,"He spoke abrupt across my dream: ""Dear Garden,"
398,XIX.,"A stranger to your magic peace, I stand"
399,XIX.,"Beyond your walls, lost in a fevered land"
400,XIX.,Of stones and fire. Would that the gods would harden
401,XIX.,"My soul against its torment, or would blind"
402,XIX.,Those yearning glimpses of a life at rest
403,XIX.,In perfect beauty--glimpses at the best
404,XIX.,"Through unpassed bars. And here, without, the wind"
405,XIX.,Of scattering passion blows: and women pass
406,XIX.,Glitter-eyed down putrid alleys where the glass
407,XIX.,Of some grimed window suddenly parades--
408,XIX.,"Ah, sickening heart-beat of desire!--the grace"
409,XIX.,"Of bare and milk-warm flesh: the vision fades,"
410,XIX.,"And at the pane shows a blind tortured face."""

418,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,"Dammed up, and thus, by its long standing still,"
419,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,Poisons itself and sickens to decay.
420,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,"All his high love for her, his fair desire,"
421,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,"Loses its light; and a dull rancorous fire,"
422,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,Burning darkness and bitterness that prey
423,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,Upon his heart are left. His spirit burns
424,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,"Sometimes with hatred, or the hatred turns"
425,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,"To a fierce lust for her, more cruel than hate,"
426,XX. SELF-TORMENT.,Till he is weary wrestling with its force:

573,THE REEF,"Soul, will and body, in the strength of triune peace,"
574,THE REEF,
575,THE REEF,Shall live the perfect grace of power unwasted.
576,THE REEF,"And love consummate, marvellously blending"

921,WAKING,"Darkness had stretched its colour,"
922,WAKING,Deep blue across the pane:
923,WAKING,"No cloud to make night duller,"
924,WAKING,No moon with its tarnish stain;
925,WAKING,"But only here and there a star,"
926,WAKING,"One sharp point of frosty fire,"
927,WAKING,Hanging infinitely far
928,WAKING,In mockery of our life and death
929,WAKING,And all our small desire.
930,WAKING,
931,WAKING,Now in this hour of waking
932,WAKING,"From under brows of stone,"
933,WAKING,A new pale day is breaking
934,WAKING,And the deep night is gone.
935,WAKING,"Sordid now, and mean and small"
936,WAKING,"The daylight world is seen again,"
937,WAKING,With only the veils of mist that fall
938,WAKING,Deaf and muffling over all
939,WAKING,To hide its ugliness and pain.
940,WAKING,
941,WAKING,But to-day this dawn of meanness
942,WAKING,"Shines in my eyes, as when"
943,WAKING,The new world's brightness and cleanness
944,WAKING,Broke on the first of men.
945,WAKING,For the light that shows the huddled things
946,WAKING,"Of this close-pressing earth,"
947,WAKING,Shines also on your face and brings
948,WAKING,All its dear beauty back to me
949,WAKING,In a new miracle of birth.
950,WAKING,
951,WAKING,"I see you asleep and unpassioned,"
952,WAKING,White-faced in the dusk of your hair--
953,WAKING,Your beauty so fleetingly fashioned
954,WAKING,That it filled me once with despair
955,WAKING,To look on its exquisite transience
956,WAKING,And think that our love and thought and laughter
957,WAKING,"Puff out with the death of our flickering sense,"
958,WAKING,While we pass ever on and away
959,WAKING,Towards some blank hereafter.
960,WAKING,
961,WAKING,"But now I am happy, knowing"
962,WAKING,"That swift time is our friend,"
963,WAKING,"And that our love's passionate glowing,"
964,WAKING,"Though it turn ash in the end,"
965,WAKING,Is a rose of fire that must blossom its way
966,WAKING,"Through temporal stuff, nor else could be"
967,WAKING,More than a nothing. Into day
968,WAKING,The boundless spaces of night contract
969,WAKING,And in your opening eyes I see
970,WAKING,"Night born in day, in time eternity."

1039,VALEDICTORY,Of yesterday and what new days might breed
1040,VALEDICTORY,Monstrously when the future brings

1051,VALEDICTORY,"""Live, only live! For you were meant"
1052,VALEDICTORY,"Never to know a thought's distress,"
1053,VALEDICTORY,But a long glad astonishment
1054,VALEDICTORY,At the world's beauty and your own.

1397,STANZAS,"Words, that should loose our spirit, do but bind"
1398,STANZAS,New fetters on our hoped-for liberty:
1399,STANZAS,And action bears us onward like a stream
1400,STANZAS,"Past fabulous shores, scarce seen in our swift course;"

1404,STANZAS,"There are slow curves, more subtle far than thought,"
1405,STANZAS,That stoop to carry the grace of a girl's breast;

1408,STANZAS,Of souls; and there are distant hills that lift
1409,STANZAS,The shoulder of a goddess towards the light;
1410,STANZAS,"And arrowy trees, sudden and sharp and swift,"
1411,STANZAS,Piercing the spirit deeply with delight.

1464,SCENES OF THE MIND,I have run where festival was loud
1465,SCENES OF THE MIND,With drum and brass among the crowd
1466,SCENES OF THE MIND,"Of panic revellers, whose cries"
1467,SCENES OF THE MIND,Affront the quiet of the skies;
1468,SCENES OF THE MIND,Whose dancing lights contract the deep
1469,SCENES OF THE MIND,Infinity of night and sleep
1470,SCENES OF THE MIND,To a narrow turmoil of troubled fire.
1471,SCENES OF THE MIND,And I have found my heart's desire
1472,SCENES OF THE MIND,In beechen caverns that autumn fills
1473,SCENES OF THE MIND,With the blue shadowiness of distant hills;

1480,SCENES OF THE MIND,Hushed as an old memorial scene.
1481,SCENES OF THE MIND,Long evenings I have sat and been
1482,SCENES OF THE MIND,"Strangely content, while in my hands"
1483,SCENES OF THE MIND,"I held a wealth of coloured strands,"

1488,SCENES OF THE MIND,"The quickening radiance, to a wan"

1490,SCENES OF THE MIND,Of what it was. And in my mind

1492,SCENES OF THE MIND,And wakened colour in what was dead
1493,SCENES OF THE MIND,And turned to gold the sullen lead
1494,SCENES OF THE MIND,Of mean desires and everyday's

1496,SCENES OF THE MIND,Sometimes in lands where mountains throw

1523,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1524,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,(From the French of Stéphane Mallarmé.)
1525,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1526,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1527,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,I would immortalize these nymphs: so bright
1528,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Their sunlit colouring, so airy light,"
1529,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,It floats like drowsing down. Loved I a dream?
1530,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"My doubts, born of oblivious darkness, seem"
1531,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A subtle tracery of branches grown
1532,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,The tree's true self--proving that I have known
1533,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"No triumph, but the shadow of a rose."
1534,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"But think. These nymphs, their loveliness ... suppose"
1535,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,They bodied forth your senses' fabulous thirst?
1536,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Illusion! which the blue eyes of the first,"
1537,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"As cold and chaste as is the weeping spring,"
1538,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Beget: the other, sighing, passioning,"
1539,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Is she the wind, warm in your fleece at noon?"
1540,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"No, through this quiet, when a weary swoon"
1541,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Crushes and chokes the latest faint essay
1542,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Of morning, cool against the encroaching day,"
1543,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"There is no murmuring water, save the gush"
1544,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of my clear fluted notes; and in the hush
1545,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Blows never a wind, save that which through my reed"
1546,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Puffs out before the rain of notes can speed
1547,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Upon the air, with that calm breath of art"
1548,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"That mounts the unwrinkled zenith visibly,"
1549,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Where inspiration seeks its native sky.
1550,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"You fringes of a calm Sicilian lake,"
1551,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"The sun's own mirror which I love to take,"
1552,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Silent beneath your starry flowers, tell"
1553,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"_How here I cut the hollow rushes, well"
1554,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Tamed by my skill, when on the glaucous gold"
1555,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of distant lawns about their fountain cold
1556,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A living whiteness stirs like a lazy wave;
1557,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,And at the first slow notes my panpipes gave
1558,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"These flocking swans, these naiads, rather, fly"
1559,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Or dive._ Noon burns inert and tawny dry,"
1560,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Nor marks how clean that Hymen slipped away
1561,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,From me who seek in song the real A.
1562,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Wake, then, to the first ardour and the sight,"
1563,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"O lonely faun, of the old fierce white light,"
1564,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"With, lilies, one of you for innocence."
1565,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Other than their lips' delicate pretence,"
1566,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"The light caress that quiets treacherous lovers,"
1567,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"My breast, I know not how to tell, discovers"
1568,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,The bitten print of some immortal's kiss.
1569,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,But hush! a mystery so great as this
1570,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I dare not tell, save to my double reed,"
1571,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Which, sharer of my every joy and need,"
1572,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Dreams down its cadenced monologues that we
1573,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Falsely confuse the beauties that we see
1574,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,With the bright palpable shapes our song creates:
1575,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"My flute, as loud as passion modulates,"
1576,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Purges the common dream of flank and breast,"
1577,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Seen through closed eyes and inwardly caressed,"
1578,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of every empty and monotonous line.
1579,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1580,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Bloom then, O Syrinx, in thy flight malign,"
1581,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A reed once more beside our trysting-lake.
1582,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Proud of my music, let me often make"
1583,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A song of goddesses and see their rape
1584,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Profanely done on many a painted shape.
1585,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"So when the grape's transparent juice I drain,"
1586,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,I quell regret for pleasures past and feign
1587,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A new real grape. For holding towards the sky
1588,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"The empty skin, I blow it tight and lie"
1589,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Dream-drunk till evening, eyeing it."
1590,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Tell o'er
1591,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Remembered joys and plump the grape once more.
1592,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,_Between the reeds I saw their bodies gleam
1593,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Who cool no mortal fever in the stream
1594,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Crying to the woods the rage of their desire:
1595,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,And their bright hair went down in jewelled fire
1596,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Where crystal broke and dazzled shudderingly.
1597,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I check my swift pursuit: for see where lie,"
1598,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Bruised, being twins in love, by languor sweet,"
1599,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Two sleeping girls, clasped at my very feet."
1600,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I seize and run with them, nor part the pair,"
1601,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Breaking this covert of frail petals, where"
1602,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Roses drink scent of the sun and our light play
1603,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,'Mid tumbled flowers shall match the death of day._
1604,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I love that virginal fury--ah, the wild"
1605,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Thrill when a maiden body shrinks, defiled,"
1606,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Shuddering like arctic light, from lips that sear"
1607,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Its nakedness ... the flesh in secret fear!
1608,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Contagiously through my linked pair it flies
1609,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Where innocence in either, struggling, dies,"
1610,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Wet with fond tears or some less piteous dew.
1611,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"_Gay in the conquest of these fears, I grew"
1612,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,So rash that I must needs the sheaf divide
1613,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied.
1614,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,For as I leaned to stifle in the hair
1615,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of one my passionate laughter (taking care
1616,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"With a stretched finger, that her innocence"
1617,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Might stain with her companion's kindling sense
1618,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"To touch the younger little one, who lay"
1619,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Child-like unblushing) my ungrateful prey
1620,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Slips from me, freed by passion's sudden death,"
1621,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Nor heeds the frenzy of my sobbing breath._
1622,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1623,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Let it pass! others of their hair shall twist
1624,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A rope to drag me to those joys I missed.
1625,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,See how the ripe pomegranates bursting red
1626,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,To quench the thirst of the mumbling bees have bled;
1627,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"So too our blood, kindled by some chance fire,"
1628,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Flows for the swarming legions of desire.
1629,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"At evening, when the woodland green turns gold"
1630,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"And ashen grey, 'mid the quenched leaves, behold!"
1631,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Red Etna glows, by Venus visited,"
1632,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Walking the lava with her snowy tread
1633,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Whene'er the flames in thunderous slumber die.
1634,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,I hold the goddess!
1635,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Ah, sure penalty!"
1636,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1637,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,But the unthinking soul and body swoon
1638,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,At last beneath the heavy hush of noon.
1639,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Forgetful let me lie where summer's drouth
1640,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Sifts fine the sand and then with gaping mouth
1641,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Dream planet-struck by the grape's round wine-red star.
