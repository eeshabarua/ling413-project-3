88,VIRG.,
89,VIRG.,
90,VIRG.,While others sing the fortune of the great;
91,VIRG.,"Empire and arms, and all the pomp of state;"
92,VIRG.,"With Britain's hero(1) set their souls on fire,"
93,VIRG.,And grow immortal as his deeds inspire;
94,VIRG.,I draw a deeper scene: a scene that yields
95,VIRG.,"A louder trumpet, and more dreadful fields;"
96,VIRG.,"The world alarm'd, both earth and heaven o'erthrown,"
97,VIRG.,And gasping nature's last tremendous groan;
98,VIRG.,"Death's ancient sceptre broke, the teeming tomb,"
99,VIRG.,"The righteous Judge, and man's eternal doom."
100,VIRG.,"'Twixt joy and pain I view the bold design,"
101,VIRG.,"And ask my anxious heart, if it be mine."
102,VIRG.,Whatever great or dreadful has been done
103,VIRG.,"Within the sight of conscious stars or sun,"
104,VIRG.,Is far beneath my daring: I look down
105,VIRG.,On all the splendours of the British crown.
106,VIRG.,This globe is for my verse a narrow bound;
107,VIRG.,"Attend me, all the glorious worlds around!"
108,VIRG.,"O! all ye angels, howsoe'er disjoin'd,"
109,VIRG.,"Of every various order, place, and kind,"
110,VIRG.,"Hear, and assist, a feeble mortal's lays;"
111,VIRG.,'Tis your Eternal King I strive to praise.
112,VIRG.,"But chiefly thou, great Ruler! Lord of all!"
113,VIRG.,Before whose throne archangels prostrate fall;
114,VIRG.,"If at thy nod, from discord, and from night,"
115,VIRG.,"Sprang beauty, and yon sparkling worlds of light,"
116,VIRG.,Exalt e'en me; all inward tumults quell;
117,VIRG.,The clouds and darkness of my mind dispel;
118,VIRG.,"To my great subject thou my breast inspire,"
119,VIRG.,And raise my lab'ring soul with equal fire.
120,VIRG.,"Man, bear thy brow aloft, view every grace"
121,VIRG.,"In God's great offspring, beauteous nature's face:"
122,VIRG.,See spring's gay bloom; see golden autumn's store;
123,VIRG.,"See how earth smiles, and hear old ocean roar."
124,VIRG.,"Leviathans but heave their cumbrous mail,"
125,VIRG.,"It makes a tide, and wind-bound navies sail."
126,VIRG.,"Here, forests rise, the mountains awful pride;"
127,VIRG.,"Here, rivers measure climes, and worlds divide;"
128,VIRG.,"There, valleys fraught with gold's resplendent seeds,"
129,VIRG.,"Hold kings, and kingdoms' fortunes, in their beds:"
130,VIRG.,"There, to the skies, aspiring hills ascend,"
131,VIRG.,And into distant lands their shades extend.
132,VIRG.,"View cities, armies, fleets; of fleets the pride,"
133,VIRG.,"See Europe's law, in Albion's channel ride."
134,VIRG.,"View the whole earth's vast landscape unconfin'd,"
135,VIRG.,Or view in Britain all her glories join'd.
136,VIRG.,Then let the firmament thy wonder raise;
137,VIRG.,"'Twill raise thy wonder, but transcend thy praise."
138,VIRG.,How far from east to west? the lab'ring eye
139,VIRG.,Can scarce the distant azure bounds descry:
140,VIRG.,"Wide theatre! where tempests play at large,"
141,VIRG.,And God's right hand can all its wrath discharge.
142,VIRG.,"Mark how those radiant lamps inflame the pole,"
143,VIRG.,"Call forth the seasons, and the year control:"
144,VIRG.,"They shine thro' time, with an unalter'd ray:"
145,VIRG.,"See this grand period rise, and that decay:"
146,VIRG.,"So vast, this world's a grain; yet myriads grace,"
147,VIRG.,"With golden pomp, the throng'd ethereal space;"
148,VIRG.,"So bright, with such a wealth of glory stor'd,"
149,VIRG.,'Twere sin in heathens not to have ador'd.
150,VIRG.,"How great, how firm, how sacred, all appears!"
151,VIRG.,How worthy an immortal round of years!
152,VIRG.,"Yet all must drop, as autumn's sickliest grain,"
153,VIRG.,And earth and firmament be sought in vain:
154,VIRG.,"The tract forgot where constellations shone,"
155,VIRG.,Or where the Stuarts fill'd an awful throne:
156,VIRG.,"Time shall be slain, all nature be destroy'd,"
157,VIRG.,Nor leave an atom in the mighty void.
158,VIRG.,"Sooner, or later, in some future date,"
159,VIRG.,(A dreadful secret in the book of fate!)
160,VIRG.,"This hour, for aught all human wisdom knows,"
161,VIRG.,Or when ten thousand harvests more have rose;
162,VIRG.,"When scenes are chang'd on this revolving earth,"
163,VIRG.,"Old empires fall, and give new empires birth;"
164,VIRG.,"While other Bourbons rule in other lands,"
165,VIRG.,And (if man's sin forbids not) other Annes;
166,VIRG.,While the still busy world is treading o'er
167,VIRG.,"The paths they trod five thousand years before,"
168,VIRG.,"Thoughtless as those who now life's mazes run,"
169,VIRG.,"Of earth dissolv'd, or an extinguish'd sun;"
170,VIRG.,"(Ye sublunary worlds, awake, awake!"
171,VIRG.,"Ye rulers of the nation, hear, and shake!)"
172,VIRG.,Thick clouds of darkness shall arise on day;
173,VIRG.,In sudden night all earth's dominions lay;
174,VIRG.,Impetuous winds the scatter'd forests rend;
175,VIRG.,"Eternal mountains, like their cedars, bend:"
176,VIRG.,"The valleys yawn, the troubled ocean roar,"
177,VIRG.,And break the bondage of his wonted shore;
178,VIRG.,A sanguine stain the silver moon o'erspread;
179,VIRG.,Darkness the circle of the sun invade;
180,VIRG.,"From inmost heaven incessant thunders roll,"
181,VIRG.,And the strong echo bound from pole to pole.
182,VIRG.,"When, lo, a mighty trump, one half conceal'd"
183,VIRG.,"In clouds, one half to mortal eye reveal'd,"
184,VIRG.,Shall pour a dreadful note; the piercing call
185,VIRG.,Shall rattle in the centre of the ball;
186,VIRG.,"Th' extended circuit of creation shake,"
187,VIRG.,"The living die with fear, the dead awake."
188,VIRG.,Oh powerful blast! to which no equal sound
189,VIRG.,"Did e'er the frighted ear of nature wound,"
190,VIRG.,"Tho' rival clarions have been strain'd on high,"
191,VIRG.,"And kindled wars immortal thro' the sky,"
192,VIRG.,"Tho' God's whole enginery discharg'd, and all"
193,VIRG.,The rebel angels bellow'd in their fall.
194,VIRG.,Have angels sinn'd? and shall not man beware?
195,VIRG.,How shall a son of earth decline the snare?
196,VIRG.,"Not folded arms, and slackness of the mind,"
197,VIRG.,Can promise for the safety of mankind:
198,VIRG.,None are supinely good: thro' care and pain
199,VIRG.,"And various arts, the steep ascent we gain."
200,VIRG.,"This is the scene of combat, not of rest,"
201,VIRG.,Man's is laborious happiness at best;
202,VIRG.,"On this side death his dangers never cease,"
203,VIRG.,"His joys are joys of conquest, not of peace."
204,VIRG.,"If then, obsequious to the will of fate,"
205,VIRG.,"And bending to the terms of human state,"
206,VIRG.,"When guilty joys invite us to their arms,"
207,VIRG.,"When beauty smiles, or grandeur spreads her charms,"
208,VIRG.,"The conscious soul would this great scene display,"
209,VIRG.,"Call down th' immortal hosts in dread array,"
210,VIRG.,"The trumpet sound, the Christian banner spread,"
211,VIRG.,And raise from silent graves the trembling dead;
212,VIRG.,"Such deep impression would the picture make,"
213,VIRG.,No power on earth her firm resolve could shake;
214,VIRG.,"Engag'd with angels she would greatly stand,"
215,VIRG.,And look regardless down on sea and land;
216,VIRG.,"Not proffer'd worlds her ardour could restrain,"
217,VIRG.,And death might shake his threat'ning lance in vain!
218,VIRG.,"Her certain conquest would endear the sight,"
219,VIRG.,And danger serve but to exalt delight.
220,VIRG.,"Instructed thus to shun the fatal spring,"
221,VIRG.,Whence flow the terrors of that day I sing;
222,VIRG.,"More boldly we our labours may pursue,"
223,VIRG.,And all the dreadful image set to view.
224,VIRG.,"The sparkling eye, the sleek and painted breast,"
225,VIRG.,"The burnish'd scale, curl'd train, and rising crest,"
226,VIRG.,"All that is lovely in the noxious snake,"
227,VIRG.,"Provokes our fear, and bids us flee the brake:"
228,VIRG.,"The sting once drawn, his guiltless beauties rise"
229,VIRG.,"In pleasing lustre, and detain our eyes;"
230,VIRG.,"We view with joy, what once did horror move,"
231,VIRG.,And strong aversion softens into love.
232,VIRG.,"Say then, my muse, whom dismal scenes delight,"
233,VIRG.,"Frequent at tombs, and in the realms of night;"
234,VIRG.,"Say, melancholy maid, if bold to dare"
235,VIRG.,The last extremes of terror and despair;
236,VIRG.,"Oh say, what change on earth, what heart in man,"
237,VIRG.,This blackest moment since the world began.
238,VIRG.,"Ah mournful turn! the blissful earth, who late"
239,VIRG.,At leisure on her axle roll'd in state;
240,VIRG.,"While thousand golden planets knew no rest,"
241,VIRG.,Still onward in their circling journey prest;
242,VIRG.,"A grateful change of seasons some to bring,"
243,VIRG.,And sweet vicissitude of fall and spring:
244,VIRG.,"Some thro' vast oceans to conduct the keel,"
245,VIRG.,"And some those watery worlds to sink, or swell:"
246,VIRG.,"Around her some their splendours to display,"
247,VIRG.,And gild her globe with tributary day:
248,VIRG.,"This world so great, of joy the bright abode,"
249,VIRG.,"Heaven's darling child, and fav'rite of her God,"
250,VIRG.,"Now looks an exile from her father's care,"
251,VIRG.,Deliver'd o'er to darkness and despair.
252,VIRG.,No sun in radiant glory shines on high;
253,VIRG.,"No light, but from the terrors of the sky:"
254,VIRG.,"Fall'n are her mountains, her fam'd rivers lost,"
255,VIRG.,And all into a second chaos tost:
256,VIRG.,One universal ruin spreads abroad;
257,VIRG.,Nothing is safe beneath the throne of God.
258,VIRG.,"Such, earth, thy fate: what then canst thou afford"
259,VIRG.,To comfort and support thy guilty lord?
260,VIRG.,"Man, haughty lord of all beneath the moon,"
261,VIRG.,How must he bend his soul's ambition down
262,VIRG.,"Prostrate, the reptile own, and disavow"
263,VIRG.,"His boasted stature, and assuming brow?"
264,VIRG.,"Claim kindred with the clay, and curse his form,"
265,VIRG.,That speaks distinction from his sister worm?
266,VIRG.,What dreadful pangs the trembling heart invade?
267,VIRG.,"Lord, why dost thou forsake whom thou hast made?"
268,VIRG.,Who can sustain thy anger? who can stand
269,VIRG.,Beneath the terrors of thy lifted hand?
270,VIRG.,"It flies the reach of thought; oh, save me, Power"
271,VIRG.,"Of powers supreme, in that tremendous hour!"
272,VIRG.,"Thou who beneath the frown of fate hast stood,"
273,VIRG.,And in thy dreadful agony sweat blood;
274,VIRG.,"Thou, who for me, thro' every throbbing vein,"
275,VIRG.,Hast felt the keenest edge of mortal pain;
276,VIRG.,"Whom death led captive thro' the realms below,"
277,VIRG.,And taught those horrid mysteries of woe;
278,VIRG.,"Defend me, O my God! Oh, save me, Power"
279,VIRG.,"Of powers supreme, in that tremendous hour!"
280,VIRG.,"From east to west they fly, from pole to line,"
281,VIRG.,Imploring shelter from the wrath divine;
282,VIRG.,"Beg flames to wrap, or whelming seas to sweep,"
283,VIRG.,"Or rocks to yawn, compassionately deep;"
284,VIRG.,"Seas cast the monster forth to meet his doom,"
285,VIRG.,And rocks but prison up for wrath to come.
286,VIRG.,So fares a traitor to an earthly crown;
287,VIRG.,While death sits threat'ning in his prince's frown
288,VIRG.,"His heart's dismay'd; and now his fears command,"
289,VIRG.,To change his native for a distant land:
290,VIRG.,"Swift orders fly, the king's severe decree"
291,VIRG.,"Stands in the channel, and locks up the sea;"
292,VIRG.,"The port he seeks, obedient to her lord,"
293,VIRG.,Hurls back the rebel to his lifted sword.
294,VIRG.,But why this idle toil to paint that day?
295,VIRG.,This time elaborately thrown away?
296,VIRG.,"Words all in vain pant after the distress,"
297,VIRG.,The height of eloquence would make it less;
298,VIRG.,Heavens! how the good man trembles!--
299,VIRG.,And is there a last day? and must there come
300,VIRG.,"A sure, a fix'd, inexorable doom?"
301,VIRG.,"Ambition swell, and, thy proud sails to show,"
302,VIRG.,Take all the winds that vanity can blow;
303,VIRG.,"Wealth on a golden mountain blazing stand,"
304,VIRG.,And reach an India forth in either hand;
305,VIRG.,"Spread all thy purple clusters, tempting vine,"
306,VIRG.,"And thou, more dreaded foe, bright beauty, shine;"
307,VIRG.,Shine all; in all your charms together rise;
308,VIRG.,"That all, in all your charms, I may despise;"
309,VIRG.,"While I mount upward on a strong desire,"
310,VIRG.,"Borne, like Elijah, in a car of fire."
311,VIRG.,In hopes of glory to be quite involv'd!
312,VIRG.,To smile at death! to long to be dissolv'd!
313,VIRG.,From our decays a pleasure to receive!
314,VIRG.,And kindle into transport at a grave!
315,VIRG.,What equals this? And shall the victor now
316,VIRG.,Boast the proud laurels on his loaded brow?
317,VIRG.,"Religion! Oh, thou cherub, heavenly bright!"
318,VIRG.,"Oh, joys unmix'd, and fathomless delight!"
319,VIRG.,"Thou, thou art all; nor find I in the whole"
320,VIRG.,"Creation aught, but God and my own soul."
321,VIRG.,"For ever, then, my soul, thy God adore,"
322,VIRG.,Nor let the brute creation praise him more.
323,VIRG.,"Shall things inanimate my conduct blame,"
324,VIRG.,And flush my conscious cheek with spreading shame?
325,VIRG.,"They all for him pursue, or quit, their end"
326,VIRG.,The mountain flames their burning power suspend;
327,VIRG.,"In solid heaps th' unfrozen billows stand,"
328,VIRG.,To rest and silence aw'd by his command:
329,VIRG.,"Nay, the dire monsters that infest the flood,"
330,VIRG.,"By nature dreadful, and athirst for blood,"
331,VIRG.,"His will can calm, their savage tempers bind,"
332,VIRG.,And turn to mild protectors of mankind.
333,VIRG.,Did not the prophet this great truth maintain
334,VIRG.,In the deep chambers of the gloomy main;
335,VIRG.,"When darkness round him all her horrors spread,"
336,VIRG.,And the loud ocean bellow'd o'er his head?
337,VIRG.,"When now the thunder roars, the lightning flies,"
338,VIRG.,And all the warring winds tumultuous rise;
339,VIRG.,"When now the foaming surges, tost on high,"
340,VIRG.,"Disclose the sands beneath, and touch the sky;"
341,VIRG.,"When death draws near, the mariners aghast,"
342,VIRG.,Look back with terror on their actions past;
343,VIRG.,"Their courage sickens into deep dismay,"
344,VIRG.,"Their hearts, thro' fear and anguish, melt away;"
345,VIRG.,"Nor tears, nor prayers, the tempest can appease;"
346,VIRG.,Now they devote their treasure to the seas;
347,VIRG.,"Unload their shatter'd barque, tho' richly fraught,"
348,VIRG.,And think the hopes of life are cheaply bought
349,VIRG.,"With gems and gold; but oh, the storm so high!"
350,VIRG.,Nor gems nor gold the hopes of life can buy.
351,VIRG.,"The trembling prophet then, themselves to save,"
352,VIRG.,They headlong plunge into the briny wave;
353,VIRG.,"Down he descends, and, booming o'er his head,"
354,VIRG.,The billows close; he's number'd with the dead.
355,VIRG.,"(Hear, O ye just! attend, ye virtuous few!"
356,VIRG.,And the bright paths of piety pursue)
357,VIRG.,"Lo! the great Ruler of the world, from high,"
358,VIRG.,"Looks smiling down with a propitious eye,"
359,VIRG.,"Covers his servant with his gracious hand,"
360,VIRG.,And bids tempestuous nature silent stand;
361,VIRG.,"Commands the peaceful waters to give place,"
362,VIRG.,Or kindly fold him in a soft embrace:
363,VIRG.,He bridles in the monsters of the deep:
364,VIRG.,The bridled monsters awful distance keep:
365,VIRG.,"Forget their hunger, while they view their prey;"
366,VIRG.,"And guiltless gaze, and round the stranger play."
367,VIRG.,But still arise new wonders; nature's Lord
368,VIRG.,"Sends forth into the deep his powerful word,"
369,VIRG.,And calls the great leviathan: the great
370,VIRG.,Leviathan attends in all his state;
371,VIRG.,"Exults for joy, and, with a mighty bound,"
372,VIRG.,"Makes the sea shake, and heaven and earth resound;"
373,VIRG.,Blackens the waters with the rising sand.
374,VIRG.,And drives vast billows to the distant land.
375,VIRG.,"As yawns an earthquake, when imprison'd air"
376,VIRG.,"Struggles for vent, and lays the centre bare,"
377,VIRG.,The whale expands his jaws' enormous size;
378,VIRG.,The prophet views the cavern with surprise;
379,VIRG.,"Measures his monstrous teeth, afar descried,"
380,VIRG.,And rolls his wond'ring eyes from side to side:
381,VIRG.,"Then takes possession of the spacious seat,"
382,VIRG.,And sails secure within the dark retreat.
383,VIRG.,"Now is he pleas'd the northern blast to hear,"
384,VIRG.,"And hangs on liquid mountains, void of fear;"
385,VIRG.,"Or falls immers'd into the depths below,"
386,VIRG.,Where the dead silent waters never flow;
387,VIRG.,"To the foundation of the hills convey'd,"
388,VIRG.,Dwells in the shelving mountain's dreadful shade:
389,VIRG.,"Where plummet never reach'd, he draws his breath,"
390,VIRG.,And glides serenely thro' the paths of death.
391,VIRG.,"Two wondrous days and nights thro' coral groves,"
392,VIRG.,"Thro' labyrinths of rocks and sands, he roves:"
393,VIRG.,When the third morning with its level rays
394,VIRG.,"The mountains gilds, and on the billows plays,"
395,VIRG.,It sees the king of waters rise and pour
396,VIRG.,His sacred guest uninjur'd on the shore:
397,VIRG.,"A type of that great blessing, which the muse"
398,VIRG.,In her next labour ardently pursues.

410,PHOCYL.,
411,PHOCYL.,
412,PHOCYL.,----We hope that the departed will rise again from the dust: after
413,PHOCYL.,"which, like the gods, they will be immortal."
414,PHOCYL.,
415,PHOCYL.,
416,PHOCYL.,"Now man awakes, and from his silent bed,"
417,PHOCYL.,"Where he has slept for ages, lifts his head;"
418,PHOCYL.,"Shakes off the slumber of ten thousand years,"
419,PHOCYL.,And on the borders of new worlds appears.
420,PHOCYL.,"Whate'er the bold, the rash, adventure cost,"
421,PHOCYL.,In wide eternity I dare be lost.
422,PHOCYL.,"The muse is wont in narrow bounds to sing,"
423,PHOCYL.,"To teach the swain, or celebrate the king."
424,PHOCYL.,"I grasp the whole, no more to parts confin'd,"
425,PHOCYL.,"I lift my voice, and sing to humankind:"
426,PHOCYL.,"I sing to men and angels; angels join,"
427,PHOCYL.,"While such the theme, their sacred songs with mine."
428,PHOCYL.,Again the trumpet's intermitted sound
429,PHOCYL.,"Rolls the wide circuit of creation round,"
430,PHOCYL.,A universal concourse to prepare
431,PHOCYL.,Of all that ever breath'd the vital air:
432,PHOCYL.,"In some wide field, which active whirlwinds sweep,"
433,PHOCYL.,"Drive cities, forests, mountains, to the deep,"
434,PHOCYL.,"To smooth and lengthen out th' unbounded space,"
435,PHOCYL.,And spread an area for all human race.
436,PHOCYL.,"Now monuments prove faithful to their trust,"
437,PHOCYL.,And render back their long committed dust.
438,PHOCYL.,"Now charnels rattle; scatter'd limbs, and all"
439,PHOCYL.,"The various bones, obsequious to the call,"
440,PHOCYL.,"Self-mov'd, advance; the neck perhaps to meet"
441,PHOCYL.,The distant head; the distant legs the feet.
442,PHOCYL.,"Dreadful to view, see thro' the dusky sky"
443,PHOCYL.,"Fragments of bodies in confusion fly,"
444,PHOCYL.,"To distant regions journeying, there to claim"
445,PHOCYL.,"Deserted members, and complete the frame."
446,PHOCYL.,"When the world bow'd to Rome's almighty sword,"
447,PHOCYL.,"Rome bow'd to Pompey, and confess'd her lord."
448,PHOCYL.,"Yet one day lost, this deity below"
449,PHOCYL.,Became the scorn and pity of his foe.
450,PHOCYL.,"His blood a traitor's sacrifice was made,"
451,PHOCYL.,And smok'd indignant on a ruffian's blade.
452,PHOCYL.,"No trumpet's sound, no gasping army's yell,"
453,PHOCYL.,"Bid, with due horror, his great soul farewell."
454,PHOCYL.,"Obscure his fall! all welt'ring in his gore,"
455,PHOCYL.,His trunk was cast to perish on the shore!
456,PHOCYL.,"While Julius frown'd the bloody monster dead,"
457,PHOCYL.,Who brought the world in his great rival's head.
458,PHOCYL.,"This sever'd head and trunk shall join once more,"
459,PHOCYL.,"Tho' realms now rise between, and oceans roar."
460,PHOCYL.,"The trumpet's sound each fragrant mote shall hear,"
461,PHOCYL.,"Or fix'd in earth, or if afloat in air,"
462,PHOCYL.,"Obey the signal wafted in the wind,"
463,PHOCYL.,And not one sleeping atom lag behind.
464,PHOCYL.,"So swarming bees, that on a summer's day"
465,PHOCYL.,"In airy rings, and wild meanders play,"
466,PHOCYL.,"Charm'd with the brazen sound, their wand'rings end,"
467,PHOCYL.,"And, gently circling, on a bough descend."
468,PHOCYL.,"The body thus renew'd, the conscious soul,"
469,PHOCYL.,"Which has perhaps been flutt'ring near the pole,"
470,PHOCYL.,"Or midst the burning planets wond'ring stray'd,"
471,PHOCYL.,Or hover'd o'er where her pale corpse was laid;
472,PHOCYL.,"Or rather coasted on her final state,"
473,PHOCYL.,And fear'd or wish'd for her appointed fate:
474,PHOCYL.,"This soul, returning with a constant flame,"
475,PHOCYL.,Now weds for ever her immortal frame.
476,PHOCYL.,"Life, which ran down before, so high is wound,"
477,PHOCYL.,The springs maintain an everlasting round.
478,PHOCYL.,Thus a frail model of the work design'd
479,PHOCYL.,"First takes a copy of the builder's mind,"
480,PHOCYL.,"Before the structure firm with lasting oak,"
481,PHOCYL.,"And marble bowels of the solid rock,"
482,PHOCYL.,"Turns the strong arch, and bids the columns rise,"
483,PHOCYL.,And bear the lofty palace to the skies;
484,PHOCYL.,"The wrongs of time enabled to surpass,"
485,PHOCYL.,"With bars of adamant, and ribs of brass."
486,PHOCYL.,"That ancient, sacred, and illustrious dome,(2)"
487,PHOCYL.,"Where soon or late fair Albion's heroes come,"
488,PHOCYL.,"From camps, and courts, tho' great, or wise, or just,"
489,PHOCYL.,"To feed the worm, and moulder into dust;"
490,PHOCYL.,"That solemn mansion of the royal dead,"
491,PHOCYL.,"Where passing slaves o'er sleeping monarchs tread,"
492,PHOCYL.,Now populous o'erflows: a num'rous race
493,PHOCYL.,Of rising kings fill all th' extended space:
494,PHOCYL.,"A life well spent, not the victorious sword,"
495,PHOCYL.,"Awards the crown, and styles the greater lord."
496,PHOCYL.,"Nor monuments alone, and burial-earth,"
497,PHOCYL.,Labours with man to this his second birth;
498,PHOCYL.,"But where gay palaces in pomp arise,"
499,PHOCYL.,"And gilded theatres invade the skies,"
500,PHOCYL.,"Nations shall wake, whose unrespected bones"
501,PHOCYL.,Support the pride of their luxurious sons.
502,PHOCYL.,The most magnificent and costly dome
503,PHOCYL.,Is but an upper chamber to the tomb.
504,PHOCYL.,"No spot on earth but has supplied a grave,"
505,PHOCYL.,And human skulls the spacious ocean pave.
506,PHOCYL.,"All's full of man; and at this dreadful turn,"
507,PHOCYL.,"The swarm shall issue, and the hive shall burn."
508,PHOCYL.,"Not all at once, nor in like manner, rise:"
509,PHOCYL.,"Some lift with pain their slow, unwilling eyes:"
510,PHOCYL.,"Shrink backward from the terror of the light,"
511,PHOCYL.,"And bless the grave, and call for lasting night."
512,PHOCYL.,"Others, whose long-attempted virtue stood"
513,PHOCYL.,"Fix'd as a rock, and broke the rushing flood,"
514,PHOCYL.,"Whose firm resolve, nor beauty could melt down,"
515,PHOCYL.,Nor raging tyrants from their posture frown;
516,PHOCYL.,"Such, in this day of horrors, shall be seen"
517,PHOCYL.,To face the thunders with a godlike mien;
518,PHOCYL.,"The planets drop, their thoughts are fixt above;"
519,PHOCYL.,"The centre shakes, their hearts disdain to move;"
520,PHOCYL.,"An earth dissolving, and a heaven thrown wide,"
521,PHOCYL.,"A yawning gulf, and fiends on every side,"
522,PHOCYL.,"Serene they view, impatient of delay,"
523,PHOCYL.,And bless the dawn of everlasting day.
524,PHOCYL.,"Here, greatness prostrate falls; there, strength gives place;"
525,PHOCYL.,"Here, lazars smile; there, beauty hides her face."
526,PHOCYL.,"Christians, and Jews, and Turks, and Pagans stand,"
527,PHOCYL.,"A blended throng, one undistinguish'd band."
528,PHOCYL.,"Some who, perhaps, by mutual wounds expir'd,"
529,PHOCYL.,"With zeal for their distinct persuasions fir'd,"
530,PHOCYL.,"In mutual friendship their long slumber break,"
531,PHOCYL.,And hand in hand their Saviour's love partake.
532,PHOCYL.,"But none are flush'd with brighter joy, or, warm"
533,PHOCYL.,"With juster confidence, enjoy the storm,"
534,PHOCYL.,"Than those, whose pious bounties, unconfin'd,"
535,PHOCYL.,Have made them public fathers of mankind.
536,PHOCYL.,"In that illustrious rank, what shining light"
537,PHOCYL.,With such distinguish'd glory fills my sight?
538,PHOCYL.,"Bend down, my grateful muse, that homage show,"
539,PHOCYL.,Which to such worthies thou art proud to owe.
540,PHOCYL.,"Wickham! Fox! Chichley! hail, illustrious names,(3)"
541,PHOCYL.,Who to far distant times dispense your beams;
542,PHOCYL.,"Beneath your shades, and near your crystal springs,"
543,PHOCYL.,I first presum'd to touch the trembling strings.
544,PHOCYL.,"All hail, thrice honour'd! 'Twas your great renown"
545,PHOCYL.,"To bless a people, and oblige a crown."
546,PHOCYL.,"And now you rise, eternally to shine,"
547,PHOCYL.,Eternally to drink the rays divine.
548,PHOCYL.,Indulgent God! Oh how shall mortal raise
549,PHOCYL.,"His soul to due returns of grateful praise,"
550,PHOCYL.,"For bounty so profuse to humankind,"
551,PHOCYL.,Thy wondrous gift of an eternal mind?
552,PHOCYL.,"Shall I, who, some few years ago, was less"
553,PHOCYL.,"Than worm, or mite, or shadow can express,"
554,PHOCYL.,"Was nothing; shall I live, when every fire"
555,PHOCYL.,And every star shall languish and expire?
556,PHOCYL.,"When earth's no more, shall I survive above,"
557,PHOCYL.,And thro' the radiant files of angels move?
558,PHOCYL.,"Or, as before the throne of God I stand,"
559,PHOCYL.,"See new worlds rolling from his spacious hand,"
560,PHOCYL.,"Where our adventures shall perhaps be taught,"
561,PHOCYL.,As we now tell how Michael sung or fought?
562,PHOCYL.,"All that has being in full concert join,"
563,PHOCYL.,And celebrate the depths of love divine!
564,PHOCYL.,"But oh! before this blissful state, before"
565,PHOCYL.,"Th' aspiring soul this wondrous height can soar,"
566,PHOCYL.,"The Judge, descending, thunders from afar,"
567,PHOCYL.,And all mankind is summon'd to the bar.
568,PHOCYL.,This mighty scene I next presume to draw:
569,PHOCYL.,"Attend, great Anna, with religious awe."
570,PHOCYL.,Expect not here the known successful arts
571,PHOCYL.,"To win attention, and command our hearts:"
572,PHOCYL.,"Fiction, be far away; let no machine"
573,PHOCYL.,"Descending here, no fabled god, be seen;"
574,PHOCYL.,"Behold the God of gods indeed descend,"
575,PHOCYL.,And worlds unnumber'd his approach attend!
576,PHOCYL.,"Lo! the wide theatre, whose ample space"
577,PHOCYL.,"Must entertain the whole of human race,"
578,PHOCYL.,"At heaven's all-powerful edict is prepar'd,"
579,PHOCYL.,And fenc'd around with an immortal guard.
580,PHOCYL.,"Tribes, provinces, dominions, worlds, o'erflow"
581,PHOCYL.,"The mighty plain, and deluge all below:"
582,PHOCYL.,"And every age, and nation, pours along,"
583,PHOCYL.,Nimrod and Bourbon mingle in the throng:
584,PHOCYL.,"Adam salutes his youngest son; no sign,"
585,PHOCYL.,"Of all those ages, which their births disjoin."
586,PHOCYL.,"How empty learning, and how vain is art,"
587,PHOCYL.,"But as it mends the life, and guides the heart!"
588,PHOCYL.,"What volumes have been swell'd, what time been spent,"
589,PHOCYL.,"To fix a hero's birth-day, or descent!"
590,PHOCYL.,"What joy must it now yield, what rapture raise,"
591,PHOCYL.,To see the glorious race of ancient days!
592,PHOCYL.,To greet those worthies who perhaps have stood
593,PHOCYL.,Illustrious on record before the flood!
594,PHOCYL.,"Alas! a nearer care your soul demands,"
595,PHOCYL.,Cæsar unnoted in your presence stands.
596,PHOCYL.,How vast the concourse! not in number more
597,PHOCYL.,"The waves that break on the resounding shore,"
598,PHOCYL.,"The leaves that tremble in the shady grove,"
599,PHOCYL.,The lamps that gild the spangled vaults above:
600,PHOCYL.,"Those overwhelming armies, whose command"
601,PHOCYL.,"Said to one empire, fall; another, stand:"
602,PHOCYL.,"Whose rear lay wrapt in night, while breaking dawn"
603,PHOCYL.,"Rous'd the broad front, and call'd the battle on:"
604,PHOCYL.,"Great Xerxes' world in arms, proud Cannæ's field,"
605,PHOCYL.,"Where Carthage taught victorious Rome to yield,"
606,PHOCYL.,"(Another blow had broke the fates' decree,"
607,PHOCYL.,"And earth had wanted her fourth monarchy,)"
608,PHOCYL.,"Immortal Blenheim, fam'd Ramillia's host,"
609,PHOCYL.,"They all are here, and here they all are lost:"
610,PHOCYL.,"Their millions swell to be discern'd in vain,"
611,PHOCYL.,Lost as a billow in th' unbounded main.
612,PHOCYL.,"This echoing voice now rends the yielding air,"
613,PHOCYL.,"For judgment, judgment, sons of men, prepare!"
614,PHOCYL.,Earth shakes anew; I hear her groans profound;
615,PHOCYL.,And hell through all her trembling realms resound.
616,PHOCYL.,"Whoe'er thou art, thou greatest power of earth,"
617,PHOCYL.,Blest with most equal planets at thy birth;
618,PHOCYL.,"Whose valour drew the most successful sword,"
619,PHOCYL.,Most realms united in one common lord;
620,PHOCYL.,"Who, on the day of triumph, saidst, Be thine"
621,PHOCYL.,"The skies, Jehovah, all this world is mine:"
622,PHOCYL.,"Dare not to lift thine eye--Alas! my muse,"
623,PHOCYL.,How art thou lost! what numbers canst thou choose?
624,PHOCYL.,"A sudden blush inflames the waving sky,"
625,PHOCYL.,And now the crimson curtains open fly;
626,PHOCYL.,"Lo! far within, and far above all height,"
627,PHOCYL.,"Where heaven's great Sov'reign reigns in worlds of light,"
628,PHOCYL.,"Whence nature he informs, and with one ray"
629,PHOCYL.,"Shot from his eye, does all her works survey,"
630,PHOCYL.,"Creates, supports, confounds! Where time, and place,"
631,PHOCYL.,"Matter, and form, and fortune, life, and grace,"
632,PHOCYL.,"Wait humbly at the footstool of their God,"
633,PHOCYL.,And move obedient at his awful nod;
634,PHOCYL.,Whence he beholds us vagrant emmets crawl
635,PHOCYL.,At random on this air-suspended ball
636,PHOCYL.,"(Speck of creation): if he pour one breath,"
637,PHOCYL.,"The bubble breaks, and 'tis eternal death."
638,PHOCYL.,Thence issuing I behold (but mortal sight
639,PHOCYL.,Sustains not such a rushing sea of light!)
640,PHOCYL.,"I see, on an empyreal flying throne"
641,PHOCYL.,"Sublimely rais'd, heaven's everlasting Son;"
642,PHOCYL.,"Crown'd with that majesty which form'd the world,"
643,PHOCYL.,And the grand rebel flaming downward hurl'd.
644,PHOCYL.,"Virtue, dominion, praise, omnipotence,"
645,PHOCYL.,Support the train of their triumphant prince.
646,PHOCYL.,"A zone, beyond the thought of angels bright,"
647,PHOCYL.,"Around him, like the zodiac, winds its light."
648,PHOCYL.,"Night shades the solemn arches of his brows,"
649,PHOCYL.,And in his cheek the purple morning glows.
650,PHOCYL.,"Where'er serene, he turns propitious eyes,"
651,PHOCYL.,"Or we expect, or find, a paradise:"
652,PHOCYL.,"But if resentment reddens their mild beams,"
653,PHOCYL.,"The Eden kindles, and the world's in flames."
654,PHOCYL.,"On one hand, knowledge shines in purest light;"
655,PHOCYL.,"On one, the sword of justice fiercely bright."
656,PHOCYL.,"Now bend the knee in sport, present the reed;"
657,PHOCYL.,Now tell the scourg'd impostor he shall bleed!
658,PHOCYL.,"Thus glorious thro' the courts of heav'n, the source"
659,PHOCYL.,Of life and death eternal bends his course;
660,PHOCYL.,"Loud thunders round him roll, and lightnings play;"
661,PHOCYL.,Th' angelic host is rang'd in bright array:
662,PHOCYL.,"Some touch the string, some strike the sounding shell,"
663,PHOCYL.,And mingling voices in rich concert swell;
664,PHOCYL.,"Voices seraphic; blest with such a strain,"
665,PHOCYL.,"Could Satan hear, he were a god again."
666,PHOCYL.,Triumphant King of Glory! Soul of bliss!
667,PHOCYL.,What a stupendous turn of fate is this!
668,PHOCYL.,O! whither art thou rais'd above the scorn
669,PHOCYL.,And indigence of him in Bethlem born;
670,PHOCYL.,"A needless, helpless, unaccounted guest,"
671,PHOCYL.,And but a second to the fodder'd beast!
672,PHOCYL.,"How chang'd from him, who, meekly prostrate laid,"
673,PHOCYL.,Vouchsaf'd to wash the feet himself had made!
674,PHOCYL.,"From him who was betray'd, forsook, denied,"
675,PHOCYL.,"Wept, languish'd, pray'd, bled, thirsted, groan'd, and died;"
676,PHOCYL.,"Hung pierc'd and bare, insulted by the foe,"
677,PHOCYL.,"All heaven in tears above, earth unconcern'd below!"
678,PHOCYL.,And was't enough to bid the sun retire?
679,PHOCYL.,Why did not nature at thy groan expire?
680,PHOCYL.,"I see, I hear, I feel, the pangs divine;"
681,PHOCYL.,"The world is vanish'd,--I am wholly thine."
682,PHOCYL.,Mistaken Caiaphas! Ah! which blasphem'd;
683,PHOCYL.,"Thou, or thy pris'ner? which shall be condemn'd?"
684,PHOCYL.,"Well might'st thou rend thy garments, well exclaim;"
685,PHOCYL.,Deep are the horrors of eternal flame!
686,PHOCYL.,But God is good! 'Tis wondrous all! Ev'n he
687,PHOCYL.,"Thou gav'st to death, shame, torture, died for thee."
688,PHOCYL.,Now the descending triumph stops its flight
689,PHOCYL.,From earth full twice a planetary height.
690,PHOCYL.,"There all the clouds condens'd, two columns raise"
691,PHOCYL.,"Distinct with orient veins, and golden blaze."
692,PHOCYL.,"One fix'd on earth, and one in sea, and round"
693,PHOCYL.,Its ample foot the swelling billows sound.
694,PHOCYL.,"These an immeasurable arch support,"
695,PHOCYL.,The grand tribunal of this awful court.
696,PHOCYL.,"Sheets of bright azure, from the purest sky,"
697,PHOCYL.,"Stream from the crystal arch, and round the columns fly."
698,PHOCYL.,"Death, wrapt in chains, low at the basis lies,"
699,PHOCYL.,And on the point of his own arrow dies.
700,PHOCYL.,"Here high enthron'd th' eternal Judge is plac'd,"
701,PHOCYL.,With all the grandeur of his godhead grac'd;
702,PHOCYL.,"Stars on his robes in beauteous order meet,"
703,PHOCYL.,And the sun burns beneath his awful feet.
704,PHOCYL.,"Now an archangel eminently bright,"
705,PHOCYL.,"From off his silver staff of wondrous height,"
706,PHOCYL.,"Unfurls the Christian flag, which waving flies,"
707,PHOCYL.,And shuts and opens more than half the skies:
708,PHOCYL.,"The cross so strong a red, it sheds a stain,"
709,PHOCYL.,"Where'er it floats, on earth, and air, and main;"
710,PHOCYL.,"Flushes the hill, and sets on fire the wood,"
711,PHOCYL.,"And turns the deep-dy'd ocean, into blood."
712,PHOCYL.,Oh formidable glory! dreadful bright!
713,PHOCYL.,Refulgent torture to the guilty sight.
714,PHOCYL.,"Ah turn, unwary muse, nor dare reveal"
715,PHOCYL.,What horrid thoughts with the polluted dwell.
716,PHOCYL.,"Say not, (to make the sun shrink in his beam,)"
717,PHOCYL.,"Dare not affirm, they wish it all a dream;"
718,PHOCYL.,"With, or their souls may with their limbs decay,"
719,PHOCYL.,Or God be spoil'd of his eternal sway.
720,PHOCYL.,"But rather, if thou know'st the means, unfold"
721,PHOCYL.,How they with transport might the scene behold.
722,PHOCYL.,"Ah how! but by repentance, by a mind"
723,PHOCYL.,"Quick, and severe its own offence to find?"
724,PHOCYL.,"By tears, and groans, and never-ceasing care,"
725,PHOCYL.,And all the pious violence of prayer?
726,PHOCYL.,"Thus then, with fervency till now unknown,"
727,PHOCYL.,"I cast my heart before th' eternal throne,"
728,PHOCYL.,"In this great temple, which the skies surround,"
729,PHOCYL.,"For homage to its lord, a narrow bound."
730,PHOCYL.,"""O thou! whose balance does the mountains weigh,"
731,PHOCYL.,"Whose will the wild tumultuous seas obey,"
732,PHOCYL.,"Whose breath can turn these watery worlds to flame,"
733,PHOCYL.,"That flame to tempest, and that tempest tame;"
734,PHOCYL.,"Earth's meanest son, all trembling, prostrate falls,"
735,PHOCYL.,And on the boundless of thy goodness calls.
736,PHOCYL.,"""Oh! give the winds all past offence to sweep,"
737,PHOCYL.,"To scatter wide, or bury in the deep:"
738,PHOCYL.,"Thy power, my weakness, may I ever see,"
739,PHOCYL.,And wholly dedicate my soul to thee:
740,PHOCYL.,Reign o'er my will; my passions ebb and flow
741,PHOCYL.,"At thy command, nor human motive know!"
742,PHOCYL.,"If anger boil, let anger be my praise,"
743,PHOCYL.,And sin the graceful indignation raise.
744,PHOCYL.,"My love be warm to succour the distress'd,"
745,PHOCYL.,And lift the burden from the soul oppress'd.
746,PHOCYL.,Oh may my understanding ever read
747,PHOCYL.,"This glorious volume, which thy wisdom made!"
748,PHOCYL.,Who decks the maiden spring with flow'ry pride?
749,PHOCYL.,"Who calls forth summer, like a sparkling bride?"
750,PHOCYL.,Who joys the mother autumn's bed to crown?
751,PHOCYL.,And bids old winter lay her honours down?
752,PHOCYL.,"Not the great Ottoman, or greater Czar,"
753,PHOCYL.,Not Europe's arbitress of peace and war.
754,PHOCYL.,"May sea and land, and earth and heaven be join'd"
755,PHOCYL.,To bring th' eternal author to my mind!
756,PHOCYL.,"When oceans roar, or awful thunders roll,"
757,PHOCYL.,May thoughts of thy dread vengeance shake my soul!
758,PHOCYL.,"When earth's in bloom, or planets proudly shine,"
759,PHOCYL.,"Adore, my heart, the majesty divine!"
760,PHOCYL.,"""Thro' every scene of life, or peace, or war,"
761,PHOCYL.,"Plenty, or want, thy glory be my care!"
762,PHOCYL.,Shine we in arms? or sing beneath our vine?
763,PHOCYL.,"Thine is the vintage, and the conquest thine:"
764,PHOCYL.,"Thy pleasure points the shaft, and bends the bow;"
765,PHOCYL.,"The cluster blasts, or bids it brightly glow:"
766,PHOCYL.,"'Tis thou that lead'st our powerful armies forth,"
767,PHOCYL.,And giv'st great Anne thy sceptre o'er the north.
768,PHOCYL.,"""Grant I may ever, at the morning ray,"
769,PHOCYL.,Open with prayer the consecrated day;
770,PHOCYL.,"Tune thy great praise, and bid my soul arise,"
771,PHOCYL.,And with the mounting sun ascend the skies:
772,PHOCYL.,"As that advances, let my zeal improve,"
773,PHOCYL.,And glow with ardour of consummate love;
774,PHOCYL.,"Nor cease at eve, but with the setting sun"
775,PHOCYL.,My endless worship shall be still begun.
776,PHOCYL.,"""And, oh! permit the gloom of solemn night"
777,PHOCYL.,To sacred thought may forcibly invite.
778,PHOCYL.,"When this world's shut, and awful planets rise,"
779,PHOCYL.,"Call on our minds, and raise them to the skies;"
780,PHOCYL.,"Compose our souls with a less dazzling sight,"
781,PHOCYL.,And show all nature in a milder light;
782,PHOCYL.,How every boisterous thought in calm subsides!
783,PHOCYL.,How the smooth'd spirit into goodness glides!
784,PHOCYL.,"O how divine! to tread the milky way,"
785,PHOCYL.,To the bright palace of the lord of day;
786,PHOCYL.,"His court admire, or for his favour sue,"
787,PHOCYL.,Or leagues of friendship with his saints renew;
788,PHOCYL.,"Pleas'd to look down, and see the world asleep,"
789,PHOCYL.,While I long vigils to its founder keep!
790,PHOCYL.,"""Canst thou not shake the centre? Oh! control,"
791,PHOCYL.,"Subdue by force, the rebel in my soul:"
792,PHOCYL.,"Thou, who canst still the raging of the flood,"
793,PHOCYL.,Restrain the various tumults of my blood;
794,PHOCYL.,"Teach me, with equal firmness, to sustain"
795,PHOCYL.,"Alluring pleasure, and assaulting pain."
796,PHOCYL.,O may I pant for thee in each desire!
797,PHOCYL.,And with strong faith foment the holy fire!
798,PHOCYL.,"Stretch out my soul in hope, and grasp the prize,"
799,PHOCYL.,Which in eternity's deep bosom lies!
800,PHOCYL.,"At the great day of recompense behold,"
801,PHOCYL.,"Devoid of fear, the fatal book unfold!"
802,PHOCYL.,"Then wafted upward to the blissful seat,"
803,PHOCYL.,"From age to age, my grateful song repeat;"
804,PHOCYL.,"My light, my life, my God, my Saviour see,"

822,--OVID. MET.,Of guilty souls; the gloomy realms of woe;
823,--OVID. MET.,And all the horrors of the world below;
824,--OVID. MET.,I next presume to sing: what yet remains
825,--OVID. MET.,"Demands my last, but most exalted strains."
826,--OVID. MET.,"And let the muse or now affect the sky,"
827,--OVID. MET.,Or in inglorious shades for ever lie.
828,--OVID. MET.,"She kindles, she's inflam'd so near the goal;"
829,--OVID. MET.,"She mounts, she gains upon the starry pole;"
830,--OVID. MET.,"The world grows less as she pursues her flight,"
831,--OVID. MET.,And the sun darkens to her distant sight.
832,--OVID. MET.,"Heaven op'ning, all its sacred pomp displays,"
833,--OVID. MET.,And overwhelms her with the rushing blaze!
834,--OVID. MET.,The triumph rings! archangels shout around!
835,--OVID. MET.,And echoing nature lengthens out the sound!
836,--OVID. MET.,Ten thousand trumpets now at once advance;
837,--OVID. MET.,Now deepest silence lulls the vast expanse:
838,--OVID. MET.,"So deep the silence, and so strong the blast,"
839,--OVID. MET.,"As nature died, when she had groan'd her last."
840,--OVID. MET.,"Nor man, nor angel, moves; the Judge on high"

842,--OVID. MET.,"Then on the fatal book his hand he lays,"
843,--OVID. MET.,Which high to view supporting seraphs raise;
844,--OVID. MET.,"In solemn form the rituals are prepar'd,"
845,--OVID. MET.,"The seal is broken, and a groan is heard."
846,--OVID. MET.,"And thou, my soul, (oh fall to sudden pray'r,"
847,--OVID. MET.,And let the thought sink deep!) shalt thou be there?
848,--OVID. MET.,See on the left (for by the great command
849,--OVID. MET.,The throng divided falls on either hand);
850,--OVID. MET.,"How weak, how pale, how haggard, how obscene,"
851,--OVID. MET.,What more than death in ev'ry face and mien!
852,--OVID. MET.,"With what distress, and glarings of affright."
853,--OVID. MET.,"They shock the heart, and turn away the sight!"
854,--OVID. MET.,"In gloomy orbs their trembling eye-balls roll,"
855,--OVID. MET.,And tell the horrid secrets of the soul.
856,--OVID. MET.,"Each gesture mourns, each look is black with care,"

866,--OVID. MET.,How would it wound! what millions wouldst thou give
867,--OVID. MET.,"For one more trial, one more day to live!"
868,--OVID. MET.,"Flung back in time an hour, a moment's space,"
869,--OVID. MET.,To grasp with eagerness the means of grace;
870,--OVID. MET.,"Contend for mercy with a pious rage,"
871,--OVID. MET.,And in that moment to redeem an age?
872,--OVID. MET.,"Drive back the tide, suspend a storm in air,"
873,--OVID. MET.,Arrest the sun!--but still of this despair.
874,--OVID. MET.,"Mark, on the right, how amiable a grace!"

885,--OVID. MET.,Oh the transcendent glory of the just!
886,--OVID. MET.,"Yet still some thin remains of fear and doubt,"
887,--OVID. MET.,Th' infected brightness of their joy pollute.
888,--OVID. MET.,"Thus the chaste bridegroom, when the priest draws nigh,"
889,--OVID. MET.,"Beholds his blessing with a trembling eye,"
890,--OVID. MET.,"Feels doubtful passions throb in every vein,"
891,--OVID. MET.,"And in his cheeks are mingled joy and pain,"

893,--OVID. MET.,"Leap forth at once, and snatch the golden prize;"
894,--OVID. MET.,"Inflame his woe, by bringing it so late,"
895,--OVID. MET.,And stab him in the crisis of his fate.
896,--OVID. MET.,"Since Adam's family, from first to last,"
897,--OVID. MET.,Now into one distinct survey is cast;
898,--OVID. MET.,"Look round, vainglorious muse, and you whoe'er"
899,--OVID. MET.,"Devote yourselves to fame, and think her fair;"
900,--OVID. MET.,"Look round, and seek the lights of human race,"
901,--OVID. MET.,Whose shining acts time's brightest annals grace;
902,--OVID. MET.,"Who founded sects; crowns conquer'd, or resign'd;"
903,--OVID. MET.,Gave names to nations: or fam'd empires join'd;
904,--OVID. MET.,"Who raised the vale, and laid the mountain low;"
905,--OVID. MET.,And taught obedient rivers where to flow;
906,--OVID. MET.,"Who with vast fleets, as with a mighty chain,"
907,--OVID. MET.,Could bind the madness of the roaring main:
908,--OVID. MET.,All lost? all undistinguish'd? nowhere found?
909,--OVID. MET.,How will this truth in Bourbon's palace sound?
910,--OVID. MET.,"That hour, on which the Almighty King on high"
911,--OVID. MET.,"From all eternity has fix'd his eye,"
912,--OVID. MET.,"Whether his right hand favour'd, or annoy'd,"
913,--OVID. MET.,"Continu'd, alter'd, threaten'd, or destroy'd;"
914,--OVID. MET.,"Southern or eastern sceptre downward hurl'd,"

917,--OVID. MET.,"For which the blood of God himself was spilt,"
918,--OVID. MET.,That dreadful moment is arriv'd.
919,--OVID. MET.,"Aloft, the seats of bliss their pomp display"
920,--OVID. MET.,"Brighter than brightness, this distinguish'd day;"
921,--OVID. MET.,"Less glorious, when of old th' eternal Son"
922,--OVID. MET.,From realms of night return'd with trophies won:
923,--OVID. MET.,"Thro' heaven's high gates, when he triumphant rode,"
924,--OVID. MET.,And shouting angels hail'd the victor God.
925,--OVID. MET.,"Horrors, beneath, darkness in darkness, hell"
926,--OVID. MET.,"Of hell, where torments behind torments dwell;"
927,--OVID. MET.,"A furnace formidable, deep, and wide,"
928,--OVID. MET.,"O'erboiling with a mad sulphureous tide,"
929,--OVID. MET.,"Expands its jaws, most dreadful to survey,"
930,--OVID. MET.,And roars outrageous for the destin'd prey.
931,--OVID. MET.,"The sons of light scarce unappall'd look down,"
932,--OVID. MET.,And nearer press heaven's everlasting throne.
933,--OVID. MET.,Such is the scene; and one short moment's space
934,--OVID. MET.,Concludes the hopes and fears of human race.
935,--OVID. MET.,"Proceed who dares!--I tremble as I write,"
936,--OVID. MET.,The whole creation swims before my sight:
937,--OVID. MET.,"I see, I see, the Judge's frowning brow;"
938,--OVID. MET.,"Say not, 'tis distant; I behold it now;"
939,--OVID. MET.,"I faint, my tardy blood forgets to flow,"
940,--OVID. MET.,My soul recoils at the stupendous woe;
941,--OVID. MET.,"That woe, those pangs, which from the guilty breast,"
942,--OVID. MET.,"In these, or words like these, shall be exprest."
943,--OVID. MET.,"""Who burst the barriers of my peaceful grave?"
944,--OVID. MET.,"Ah! cruel death, that would no longer save,"
945,--OVID. MET.,"But grudg'd me e'en that narrow dark abode,"
946,--OVID. MET.,And cast me out into the wrath of God;
947,--OVID. MET.,"Where shrieks, the roaring flame, the rattling chain,"
948,--OVID. MET.,"And all the dreadful eloquence of pain,"
949,--OVID. MET.,"Our only song; black fire's malignant light,"
950,--OVID. MET.,The sole refreshment of the blasted sight.
951,--OVID. MET.,"Must all those pow'rs, heaven gave me to supply"
952,--OVID. MET.,"My soul with pleasure, and bring in my joy,"
953,--OVID. MET.,"Rise up in arms against me, join the foe,"
954,--OVID. MET.,"Sense, reason, memory, increase my woe?"
955,--OVID. MET.,"And shall my voice, ordain'd on hymns to dwell,"
956,--OVID. MET.,"Corrupt to groans, and blow the fires of hell?"
957,--OVID. MET.,"Oh! must I look with terror on my gain,"
958,--OVID. MET.,And with existence only measure pain?
959,--OVID. MET.,"What! no reprieve, no least indulgence given,"
960,--OVID. MET.,"No beam of hope, from any point of heaven!"
961,--OVID. MET.,Ah mercy! mercy! art thou dead above?
962,--OVID. MET.,Is love extinguish'd in the source of love?
963,--OVID. MET.,"""Bold that I am, did heaven stoop down to hell?"
964,--OVID. MET.,Th' expiring Lord of life my ransom seal?
965,--OVID. MET.,Have I not been industrious to provoke?
966,--OVID. MET.,From his embraces obstinately broke?
967,--OVID. MET.,"Pursu'd and panted for his mortal hate,"
968,--OVID. MET.,"Earn'd my destruction, labour'd out my fate?"
969,--OVID. MET.,And dare I on extinguish'd love exclaim?
970,--OVID. MET.,"Take, take full vengeance, rouse the slack'ning flame;"
971,--OVID. MET.,Just is my lot--but oh! must it transcend
972,--OVID. MET.,"The reach of time, despair a distant end?"
973,--OVID. MET.,"With dreadful growth shoot forward, and arise,"
974,--OVID. MET.,"Where thought can't follow, and bold fancy dies?"
975,--OVID. MET.,"""Never! where falls the soul at that dread sound?"
976,--OVID. MET.,"Down an abyss how dark, and how profound?"
977,--OVID. MET.,"Down, down, (I still am falling, horrid pain!)"
978,--OVID. MET.,Ten thousand thousand fathoms still remain;
979,--OVID. MET.,My plunge but still begun--And this for sin?
980,--OVID. MET.,"Could I offend, if I had never been,"
981,--OVID. MET.,"But still increas'd the senseless happy mass,"
982,--OVID. MET.,"Flow'd in the stream, or shiver'd in the grass?"
983,--OVID. MET.,"""Father of mercies! why from silent earth"
984,--OVID. MET.,"Didst thou awake, and curse me into birth?"
985,--OVID. MET.,"Tear me from quiet, ravish me from night,"
986,--OVID. MET.,And make a thankless present of thy light?
987,--OVID. MET.,"Push into being a reverse of thee,"
988,--OVID. MET.,And animate a clod with misery?
989,--OVID. MET.,"""The beasts are happy; they come forth, and keep"
990,--OVID. MET.,"Short watch on earth, and then lie down to sleep."
991,--OVID. MET.,Pain is for man; and oh! how vast a pain
992,--OVID. MET.,"For crimes, which made the Godhead bleed in vain!"
993,--OVID. MET.,"Annull'd his groans, as far as in them lay,"
994,--OVID. MET.,"And flung his agonies, and death, away!"
995,--OVID. MET.,"As our dire punishment for ever strong,"
996,--OVID. MET.,"Our constitution too for ever young,"
997,--OVID. MET.,"Curs'd with returns of vigour, still the same,"
998,--OVID. MET.,"Powerful to bear, and satisfy the flame:"
999,--OVID. MET.,"Still to be caught, and still to be pursu'd!"
1000,--OVID. MET.,"To perish still, and still to be renew'd!"
1001,--OVID. MET.,"""And this, my help! my God! at thy decree?"
1002,--OVID. MET.,"Nature is chang'd, and hell should succour me."
1003,--OVID. MET.,"And canst thou then look down from perfect bliss,"
1004,--OVID. MET.,And see me plunging in the dark abyss?
1005,--OVID. MET.,"Calling thee Father, in a sea of fire?"
1006,--OVID. MET.,Or pouring blasphemies at thy desire?
1007,--OVID. MET.,"With mortals' anguish wilt thou raise thy name,"
1008,--OVID. MET.,And by my pangs omnipotence proclaim?
1009,--OVID. MET.,"""Thou, who canst toss the planets to and fro,"
1010,--OVID. MET.,Contract not thy great vengeance to my woe;
1011,--OVID. MET.,Crush worlds; in hotter flames fall'n angels lay;
1012,--OVID. MET.,On me Almighty wrath is cast away.
1013,--OVID. MET.,"Call back thy thunders, Lord, hold in thy rage,"
1014,--OVID. MET.,Nor with a speck of wretchedness engage:
1015,--OVID. MET.,"Forget me quite, nor stoop a worm to blame;"
1016,--OVID. MET.,But lose me in the greatness of thy name.
1017,--OVID. MET.,"Thou art all love, all mercy, all divine,"
1018,--OVID. MET.,And shall I make these glories cease to shine?
1019,--OVID. MET.,"Shall sinful man grow great by his offence,"
1020,--OVID. MET.,And from its course turn back Omnipotence?
1021,--OVID. MET.,"""Forbid it! and oh! grant, great God, at least"
1022,--OVID. MET.,"This one, this slender, almost no request;"
1023,--OVID. MET.,"When I have wept a thousand lives away,"
1024,--OVID. MET.,"When torment is grown weary of its prey,"
1025,--OVID. MET.,"When I have rav'd ten thousand years in fire,"
1026,--OVID. MET.,"Ten thousand thousand, let me then expire."""
1027,--OVID. MET.,"Deep anguish! but too late; the hopeless soul,"
1028,--OVID. MET.,"Bound to the bottom of the burning pool,"
1029,--OVID. MET.,"Though loth, and ever loud blaspheming, owns"
1030,--OVID. MET.,He's justly doom'd to pour eternal groans;
1031,--OVID. MET.,"Enclos'd with horrors, and transfix'd with pain,"
1032,--OVID. MET.,"Rolling in vengeance, struggling with his chain:"
1033,--OVID. MET.,To talk to fiery tempests; to implore
1034,--OVID. MET.,The raging flame to give its burnings o'er;
1035,--OVID. MET.,"To toss, to writhe, to pant beneath his load,"
1036,--OVID. MET.,And bear the weight of an offended God.
1037,--OVID. MET.,"The favour'd of their Judge, in triumph move"
1038,--OVID. MET.,To take possession of their thrones above;
1039,--OVID. MET.,"Satan's accurs'd desertion to supply,"
1040,--OVID. MET.,And fill the vacant stations of the sky;
1041,--OVID. MET.,"Again to kindle long-extinguish'd rays,"
1042,--OVID. MET.,And with new lights dilate the heavenly blaze;
1043,--OVID. MET.,"To crop the roses of immortal youth,"
1044,--OVID. MET.,And drink the fountain-head of sacred truth
1045,--OVID. MET.,"To swim in seas of bliss, to strike the string,"
1046,--OVID. MET.,And lift the voice to their Almighty King;
1047,--OVID. MET.,"To lose eternity in grateful lays,"
1048,--OVID. MET.,And fill heaven's wide circumference with praise.
1049,--OVID. MET.,"But I attempt the wondrous height in vain,"
1050,--OVID. MET.,And leave unfinish'd the too lofty strain:
1051,--OVID. MET.,"What boldly I begin, let others end;"
1052,--OVID. MET.,"My strength exhausted, fainting I descend,"
1053,--OVID. MET.,"And choose a less, but no ignoble, theme,"
1054,--OVID. MET.,"Dissolving elements, and worlds, in flame."
1055,--OVID. MET.,"The fatal period, the great hour, is come,"

1059,--OVID. MET.,"Sharp lightnings with the meteor's blaze conspire,"
1060,--OVID. MET.,"And, darted downward, set the world on fire;"
1061,--OVID. MET.,"Black rising clouds the thicken'd ether choke,"
1062,--OVID. MET.,"And spiry flames dart through the rolling smoke,"
1063,--OVID. MET.,"With keen vibrations cut the sullen night,"
1064,--OVID. MET.,And strike the darken'd sky with dreadful light;
1065,--OVID. MET.,"From heaven's four regions, with immortal force,"
1066,--OVID. MET.,"Angels drive on the wind's impetuous course,"
1067,--OVID. MET.,"T' enrage the flame: It spreads, it soars on high,"
1068,--OVID. MET.,"Swells in the storm, and billows through the sky:"
1069,--OVID. MET.,"Here winding pyramids of fire ascend,"
1070,--OVID. MET.,Cities and deserts in one ruin blend;
1071,--OVID. MET.,"Here blazing volumes wafted, overwhelm"
1072,--OVID. MET.,The spacious face of a far distant realm;
1073,--OVID. MET.,"There, undermin'd, down rush eternal hills,"
1074,--OVID. MET.,The neighb'ring vales the vast destruction fills.
1075,--OVID. MET.,Hear'st thou that dreadful crack? that sound which broke
1076,--OVID. MET.,"Like peals of thunder, and the centre shook?"
1077,--OVID. MET.,What wonders must that groan of nature tell?
1078,--OVID. MET.,"Olympus there, and mightier Atlas, fell;"
1079,--OVID. MET.,"Which seem'd above the reach of fate to stand,"
1080,--OVID. MET.,A tow'ring monument of God's right hand;
1081,--OVID. MET.,"Now dust and smoke, whose brow, so lately, spread"
1082,--OVID. MET.,O'er shelter'd countries its diffusive shade.
1083,--OVID. MET.,"Show me that celebrated spot, where all"
1084,--OVID. MET.,The various rulers of the sever'd ball
1085,--OVID. MET.,"Have humbly sought wealth, honour, and redress,"
1086,--OVID. MET.,"That land which heaven seem'd diligent to bless,"
1087,--OVID. MET.,Once call'd Britannia: can her glories end?
1088,--OVID. MET.,And can't surrounding seas her realms defend?
1089,--OVID. MET.,Alas! in flames behold surrounding seas!
1090,--OVID. MET.,"Like oil, their waters but augment the blaze."
1091,--OVID. MET.,"Some angel say, where ran proud Asia's bound?"
1092,--OVID. MET.,Or where with fruits was fair Europa crown'd?
1093,--OVID. MET.,Where stretch'd waste Lybia? Where did India's shore
1094,--OVID. MET.,"Sparkle in diamonds, and her golden ore?"
1095,--OVID. MET.,"Each lost in each, their mingling kingdoms glow,"
1096,--OVID. MET.,"And all dissolv'd, one fiery deluge flow:"
1097,--OVID. MET.,"Thus earth's contending monarchies are join'd,"

1195,VIRG.,"Hurl'd from the summit of imperial state,"
1196,VIRG.,With equal mind sustain'd the stroke of fate.

1213,VIRG.,"""Grieve not, my lord; a crown indeed is lost;"

1215,VIRG.,A mind compos'd; a mind that can disdain
1216,VIRG.,A fruitless sorrow for a loss so vain.
1217,VIRG.,Nothing is loss that virtue can improve
1218,VIRG.,To wealth eternal; and return above;
1219,VIRG.,"Above, where no distinction shall be known"
1220,VIRG.,"'Twixt him whom storms have shaken from a throne,"
1221,VIRG.,"And him, who, basking in the smiles of fate,"
1222,VIRG.,Shone forth in all the splendour of the great:
1223,VIRG.,Nor can I find the diff'rence here below;
1224,VIRG.,"I lately was a queen; I still am so,"
1225,VIRG.,"While Guilford's wife: thee rather I obey,"
1226,VIRG.,Than o'er mankind extend imperial sway.
1227,VIRG.,"When we lie down in some obscure retreat,"
1228,VIRG.,Incens'd Maria may her rage forget;
1229,VIRG.,"And I to death my duty will improve,"
1230,VIRG.,"And what you miss in empire, add in love--"

1234,VIRG.,To find with what content we lay it down.
1235,VIRG.,"Heroes may win, but 't is a heavenly race"
1236,VIRG.,"Can quit a throne with a becoming grace."""
1237,VIRG.,"Thus spoke the fairest of her sex, and cheer'd"
1238,VIRG.,Her drooping lord; whose boding bosom fear'd
1239,VIRG.,"A darker cloud of ills would burst, and shed"
1240,VIRG.,Severer vengeance on her guiltless head:
1241,VIRG.,"Too just, alas, the terrors which he felt!"
1242,VIRG.,"For, lo! a guard!--Forgive him, if he melt--"
1243,VIRG.,"How sharp her pangs, when sever'd from his side,"
1244,VIRG.,"The most sincerely lov'd, and loving bride,"
1245,VIRG.,"In space confin'd, the muse forbears to tell;"
1246,VIRG.,"Deep was her anguish, but she bore it well."
1247,VIRG.,"His pain was equal, but his virtue less;"
1248,VIRG.,He thought in grief there could be no excess.
1249,VIRG.,"Pensive he sat, o'ercast with gloomy care,"
1250,VIRG.,And often fondly clasp'd his absent fair;
1251,VIRG.,"Now, silent, wander'd thro' his rooms of state,"
1252,VIRG.,"And sicken'd at the pomp, and tax'd his fate;"
1253,VIRG.,"Which thus adorn'd, in all her shining store,"
1254,VIRG.,"A splendid wretch, magnificently poor."
1255,VIRG.,"Now on the bridal-bed his eyes were cast,"
1256,VIRG.,And anguish fed on his enjoyments past;
1257,VIRG.,"Each recollected pleasure made him smart,"
1258,VIRG.,And every transport stabb'd him to the heart.
1259,VIRG.,"That happy moon, which summon'd to delight,"
1260,VIRG.,"That moon which shone on his dear nuptial night,"
1261,VIRG.,Which saw him fold her yet untasted charms
1262,VIRG.,(Denied to princes) in his longing arms;
1263,VIRG.,"Now sees the transient blessing fleet away,"
1264,VIRG.,Empire and love! the vision of a day.
1265,VIRG.,"Thus, in the British clime, a summer-storm"
1266,VIRG.,Will oft the smiling face of heaven deform;
1267,VIRG.,"The winds with violence at once descend,"
1268,VIRG.,"Sweep flowers and fruits, and make the forest bend;"
1269,VIRG.,"A sudden winter, while the sun is near,"
1270,VIRG.,"O'ercomes the season, and inverts the year."
1271,VIRG.,"But whither is the captive borne away,"
1272,VIRG.,"The beauteous captive, from the cheerful day?"
1273,VIRG.,The scene is chang'd indeed; before her eyes
1274,VIRG.,Ill boding looks and unknown horrors rise:
1275,VIRG.,"For pomp and splendour, for her guard and crown,"
1276,VIRG.,"A gloomy dungeon, and a keeper's frown:"
1277,VIRG.,"Black thoughts, each morn, invade the lover's breast,"
1278,VIRG.,"Each night, a ruffian locks the queen to rest."
1279,VIRG.,"Ah mournful change, if judg'd by vulgar minds!"
1280,VIRG.,But Suffolk's daughter its advantage finds.
1281,VIRG.,Religion's force divine is best display'd
1282,VIRG.,In deep desertion of all human aid:
1283,VIRG.,"To succour in extremes, is her delight,"
1284,VIRG.,"And cheer the heart, when terror strikes the sight."
1285,VIRG.,"We, disbelieving our own senses, gaze,"
1286,VIRG.,And wonder what a mortal's heart can raise
1287,VIRG.,"To triumph o'er misfortunes, smile in grief,"
1288,VIRG.,And comfort those who come to bring relief:
1289,VIRG.,"We gaze; and as we gaze, wealth, fame, decay,"
1290,VIRG.,And all the world's vain glories fade away.
1291,VIRG.,"Against her cares she rais'd a dauntless mind,"
1292,VIRG.,"And with an ardent heart, but most resign'd,"
1293,VIRG.,"Deep in the dreadful gloom, with pious heat,"
1294,VIRG.,"Amid the silence of her dark retreat,"
1295,VIRG.,"Address'd her God,--""Almighty power divine!"
1296,VIRG.,"'Tis thine to raise, and to depress, is thine;"
1297,VIRG.,"With honour to light up the name unknown,"
1298,VIRG.,Or to put out the lustre of a throne.
1299,VIRG.,"In my short span both fortunes I have prov'd,"
1300,VIRG.,"And though with ill frail nature will be mov'd,"
1301,VIRG.,I'll bear it well: (O strengthen me to bear!)
1302,VIRG.,And if my piety may claim thy care;
1303,VIRG.,"If I remember'd, in youth's giddy heat,"
1304,VIRG.,"And tumult of a court, a future state;"
1305,VIRG.,"O favour, when thy mercy I implore"
1306,VIRG.,For one who never guilty sceptre bore!
1307,VIRG.,'Twas I receiv'd the crown; my lord is free;
1308,VIRG.,"If it must fall, let vengeance fall on me."
1309,VIRG.,"Let him survive, his country's name to raise,"
1310,VIRG.,And in a guilty land to speak thy praise!
1311,VIRG.,"O may th' indulgence of a father's love,"
1312,VIRG.,"Pour'd forth on me, be doubled from above!"
1313,VIRG.,"If these are safe, I'll think my prayers succeed,"
1314,VIRG.,"And bless thy tender mercies, whilst I bleed."""
1315,VIRG.,'Twas now the mournful eve before that day
1316,VIRG.,In which the queen to her full wrath gave way;
1317,VIRG.,"Thro' rigid justice, rush'd into offence,"
1318,VIRG.,And drank in zeal the blood of innocence:
1319,VIRG.,"The sun went down in clouds, and seem'd to mourn"
1320,VIRG.,The sad necessity of his return;
1321,VIRG.,"The hollow wind, and melancholy rain,"
1322,VIRG.,"Or did, or was imagin'd to, complain:"
1323,VIRG.,The tapers cast an inauspicious light;
1324,VIRG.,"Stars there were none, and doubly dark the night."
1325,VIRG.,Sweet innocence in chains can take her rest;
1326,VIRG.,"Soft slumber gently creeping through her breast,"
1327,VIRG.,"She sinks; and in her sleep is reinthron'd,"
1328,VIRG.,"Mock'd by a gaudy dream, and vainly crown'd."
1329,VIRG.,"She views her fleets and armies, seas and land,"
1330,VIRG.,And stretches wide her shadow of command:
1331,VIRG.,With royal purple is her vision hung;
1332,VIRG.,By phantom hosts are shouts of conquest rung;
1333,VIRG.,Low at her feet the suppliant rival lies;
1334,VIRG.,"Our prisoner mourns her fate, and bids her rise."
1335,VIRG.,"Now level beams upon the waters play'd,"
1336,VIRG.,"Glanc'd on the hills, and westward cast the shade;"
1337,VIRG.,The busy trades in city had began
1338,VIRG.,"To sound, and speak the painful life of man."
1339,VIRG.,"In tyrants' breasts the thoughts of vengeance rouse,"
1340,VIRG.,And the fond bridegroom turns him to his spouse.
1341,VIRG.,"At this first birth of light, while morning breaks,"
1342,VIRG.,"Our spouseless bride, our widow'd wife, awakes;"
1343,VIRG.,"Awakes, and smiles; nor night's imposture blames;"
1344,VIRG.,Her real pomps were little more than dreams;
1345,VIRG.,"A short-liv'd blaze, a lightning quickly o'er,"
1346,VIRG.,"That died in birth, that shone, and were no more:"
1347,VIRG.,"She turns her side, and soon resumes a state"
1348,VIRG.,"Of mind, well suited to her alter'd fate,"
1349,VIRG.,"Serene, though serious; when dread tidings come"
1350,VIRG.,(Ah wretched Guilford!) of her instant doom.
1351,VIRG.,"Sun, hide thy beams; in clouds as black as night"
1352,VIRG.,Thy face involve; be guiltless of the sight;
1353,VIRG.,Or haste more swiftly to the western main;
1354,VIRG.,Nor let her blood the conscious daylight stain!
1355,VIRG.,"Oh! how severe! to fall so new a bride,"
1356,VIRG.,"Yet blushing from the priest, in youthful pride;"
1357,VIRG.,"When time had just matur'd each perfect grace,"
1358,VIRG.,And open'd all the wonders of her face!
1359,VIRG.,"To leave her Guilford dead to all relief,"
1360,VIRG.,"Fond of his woe, and obstinate in grief."
1361,VIRG.,"Unhappy fair! whatever fancy drew,"
1362,VIRG.,"(Vain promis'd blessings,) vanish from her view;"
1363,VIRG.,"No train of cheerful days, endearing nights,"
1364,VIRG.,"No sweet domestic joys, and chaste delights;"
1365,VIRG.,Pleasures that blossom e'en from doubts and fears;
1366,VIRG.,And bliss and rapture rising out of cares:
1367,VIRG.,"No little Guilford, with paternal grace,"
1368,VIRG.,"Lull'd on her knee, or smiling in her face;"
1369,VIRG.,"Who, when her dearest father shall return,"
1370,VIRG.,"From pouring tears on her untimely urn,"
1371,VIRG.,"Might comfort to his silver hairs impart,"
1372,VIRG.,And fill her place in his indulgent heart:
1373,VIRG.,"As where fruits fall, quick rising blossoms smile,"
1374,VIRG.,"And the bless'd Indian of his care beguile,"
1375,VIRG.,"In vain these various reasons jointly press,"
1376,VIRG.,"To blacken death, and heighten her distress;"
1377,VIRG.,"She, thro' th' encircling terrors darts her sight"
1378,VIRG.,"To the bless'd regions of eternal light,"
1379,VIRG.,And fills her soul with peace: to weeping friends
1380,VIRG.,"Her father, and her lord, she recommends;"
1381,VIRG.,"Unmov'd herself: her foes her air survey,"
1382,VIRG.,And rage to see their malice thrown away.
1383,VIRG.,She soars; now nought on earth detains her care----
1384,VIRG.,But Guilford; who still struggles for his share.
1385,VIRG.,"Still will his form importunately rise,"
1386,VIRG.,Clog and retard her transport to the skies;
1387,VIRG.,"As trembling flames now take a feeble flight,"
1388,VIRG.,"Now catch the brand with a returning light,"
1389,VIRG.,Thus her soul onward from the seats above
1390,VIRG.,"Falls fondly back, and kindles into love:"
1391,VIRG.,At length she conquers in the doubtful field;
1392,VIRG.,That heaven she seeks will be her Guilford's shield.
1393,VIRG.,Now death is welcome; his approach is slow;
1394,VIRG.,'Tis tedious longer to expect the blow.
1395,VIRG.,"Oh! mortals, short of sight, who think the past"
1396,VIRG.,O'erblown misfortune still shall prove the last:
1397,VIRG.,"Alas! misfortunes travel in a train,"
1398,VIRG.,And oft in life form one perpetual chain;
1399,VIRG.,"Fear buries fear, and ills on ills attend,"
1400,VIRG.,Till life and sorrow meet one common end.
1401,VIRG.,"She thinks that she has nought but death to fear,"
1402,VIRG.,And death is conquer'd. Worse than death is near.
1403,VIRG.,Her rigid trials are not yet complete;
1404,VIRG.,The news arrives of her great father's fate.
1405,VIRG.,"She sees his hoary head, all white with age,"
1406,VIRG.,A victim to th' offended monarch's rage.
1407,VIRG.,"How great the mercy, had she breath'd her last,"
1408,VIRG.,Ere the dire sentence on her father past!
1409,VIRG.,A fonder parent nature never knew;
1410,VIRG.,"And as his age increas'd, his fondness grew."
1411,VIRG.,A parent's love ne'er better was bestow'd;
1412,VIRG.,The pious daughter in her heart o'erflow'd.
1413,VIRG.,And can she from all weakness still refrain?
1414,VIRG.,And still the firmness of her soul maintain?
1415,VIRG.,Impossible! a sigh will force its way;
1416,VIRG.,One patient tear her mortal birth betray;
1417,VIRG.,"She sighs and weeps! but so she weeps and sighs,"
1418,VIRG.,"As silent dews descend, and vapours rise."
1419,VIRG.,Celestial patience! how dost thou defeat
1420,VIRG.,"The foe's proud menace, and elude his hate!"
1421,VIRG.,"While passion takes his part, betrays our peace;"
1422,VIRG.,To death and torture swells each slight disgrace;
1423,VIRG.,"By not opposing, thou dost ills destroy,"
1424,VIRG.,And wear thy conquer'd sorrows into joy.
1425,VIRG.,"Now she revolves within her anxious mind,"
1426,VIRG.,What woe still lingers in reserve behind.
1427,VIRG.,"Griefs rise on griefs, and she can see no bound,"
1428,VIRG.,"While nature lasts, and can receive a wound."
1429,VIRG.,"The sword is drawn; the queen to rage inclin'd,"
1430,VIRG.,"By mercy, nor by piety, confin'd."
1431,VIRG.,"What mercy can the zealot's heart assuage,"
1432,VIRG.,Whose piety itself converts to rage?
1433,VIRG.,"She thought, and sigh'd. And now the blood began"
1434,VIRG.,To leave her beauteous cheek all cold and wan.
1435,VIRG.,"New sorrow dimm'd the lustre of her eye,"
1436,VIRG.,And on her cheek the fading roses die.
1437,VIRG.,Alas! should Guilford too--when now she's brought
1438,VIRG.,"To that dire view, that precipice of thought,"
1439,VIRG.,"While there she trembling stands, nor dares look down,"
1440,VIRG.,"Nor can recede, till heaven's decrees are known;"
1441,VIRG.,"Cure of all ills, till now, her lord appears--"
1442,VIRG.,"But not to cheer her heart, and dry her tears!"
1443,VIRG.,"Not now, as usual, like the rising day,"
1444,VIRG.,"To chase the shadows, and the damps away:"
1445,VIRG.,"But, like a gloomy storm, at once to sweep"
1446,VIRG.,And plunge her to the bottom of the deep.
1447,VIRG.,"Black were his robes, dejected was his air,"
1448,VIRG.,His voice was frozen by his cold despair;
1449,VIRG.,"Slow, like a ghost, he mov'd with solemn pace;"
1450,VIRG.,A dying paleness sat upon his face.
1451,VIRG.,"Back she recoil'd, she smote her lovely breast,"
1452,VIRG.,Her eyes the anguish of her heart confess'd;
1453,VIRG.,"Struck to the soul, she stagger'd with the wound,"
1454,VIRG.,"And sunk, a breathless image, to the ground."
1455,VIRG.,"Thus the fair lily, when the sky's o'ercast,"
1456,VIRG.,At first but shudders in the feeble blast;
1457,VIRG.,"But when the winds and weighty rains descend,"
1458,VIRG.,The fair and upright stem is forc'd to bend;
1459,VIRG.,"Till broke at length, its snowy leaves are shed,"
1460,VIRG.,And strew with dying sweets their native bed.

1490,--VIRG.,"The manly temper of the bravest soul,"
1491,--VIRG.,"What with afflicted beauty can compare,"
1492,--VIRG.,And drops of love distilling from the fair?
1493,--VIRG.,It melts us down; our pains delight bestow;
1494,--VIRG.,And we with fondness languish o'er our woe.
1495,--VIRG.,"This Guilford prov'd; and, with excess of pain,"
1496,--VIRG.,"And pleasure too, did to his bosom strain"
1497,--VIRG.,"The weeping fair: sunk deep in soft desire,"
1498,--VIRG.,"Indulg'd his love, and nurs'd the raging fire:"
1499,--VIRG.,"Then tore himself away; and, standing wide,"
1500,--VIRG.,"As fearing a relapse of fondness, cried,"
1501,--VIRG.,"With ill-dissembled grief; ""My life, forbear!"
1502,--VIRG.,You wound your Guilford with each cruel tear:
1503,--VIRG.,Did you not chide my grief? repress your own;
1504,--VIRG.,Nor want compassion for yourself alone:
1505,--VIRG.,"Have you beheld, how, from the distant main,"
1506,--VIRG.,"The thronging waves roll on, a num'rous train,"
1507,--VIRG.,"And foam, and bellow, till they reach the shore;"
1508,--VIRG.,"There burst their noisy pride, and are no more?"
1509,--VIRG.,"Thus the successive flows of human race,"
1510,--VIRG.,"Chas'd by the coming, the preceding, chase;"
1511,--VIRG.,"They sound, and swell, their haughty heads they rear;"
1512,--VIRG.,"Then fall, and flatten, break, and disappear."
1513,--VIRG.,Life is a forfeit we must shortly pay;
1514,--VIRG.,And where's the mighty lucre of a day?
1515,--VIRG.,Why should you mourn my fate? 'tis most unkind;
1516,--VIRG.,Your own you bore with an unshaken mind:
1517,--VIRG.,"And which, can you imagine, was the dart"
1518,--VIRG.,"That drank most blood, sunk deepest in my heart?"
1519,--VIRG.,I cannot live without you; and my doom
1520,--VIRG.,"I meet with joy, to share one common tomb.--"
1521,--VIRG.,And are again your tears profusely spilt!
1522,--VIRG.,"Oh! then, my kindness blackens to my guilt;"
1523,--VIRG.,"It foils itself, if it recall your pain;--"
1524,--VIRG.,"Life of my life, I beg you to refrain!"
1525,--VIRG.,"The load which fate imposes, you increase;"
1526,--VIRG.,"And help Maria to destroy my peace."""
1527,--VIRG.,"But, oh! against himself his labour turn'd;"
1528,--VIRG.,"The more he comforted, the more she mourn'd:"
1529,--VIRG.,Compassion swells our grief; words soft and kind
1530,--VIRG.,"But soothe our weakness, and dissolve the mind:"
1531,--VIRG.,"Her sorrow flow'd in streams; nor hers alone,"
1532,--VIRG.,"While that he blam'd, he yielded to his own."
1533,--VIRG.,"Where are the smiles she wore, when she, so late,"
1534,--VIRG.,Hail'd him great partner of the regal state;
1535,--VIRG.,"When orient gems around her temples blaz'd,"
1536,--VIRG.,And bending nations on the glory gaz'd?
1537,--VIRG.,"'Tis now the queen's command, they both retreat,"
1538,--VIRG.,"To weep with dignity, and mourn in state:"
1539,--VIRG.,"She forms the decent misery with joy,"
1540,--VIRG.,And loads with pomp the wretch she would destroy.
1541,--VIRG.,A spacious hall is hung with black; all light
1542,--VIRG.,"Shut out, and noon-day darken'd into night."
1543,--VIRG.,"From the mid-roof a lamp depends on high,"
1544,--VIRG.,Like a dim crescent in a clouded sky:
1545,--VIRG.,"It sheds a quiv'ring melancholy gloom,"
1546,--VIRG.,Which only shows the darkness of the room.
1547,--VIRG.,A shining axe is on the table laid;
1548,--VIRG.,A dreadful sight! and glitters through the shade.
1549,--VIRG.,In this sad scene the lovers are confin'd;
1550,--VIRG.,"A scene of terrors, to a guilty mind!"
1551,--VIRG.,"A scene, that would have damp'd with rising cares,"
1552,--VIRG.,And quite extinguish'd every love but theirs.
1553,--VIRG.,What can they do? They fix their mournful eyes----
1554,--VIRG.,"Then Guilford, thus abruptly; ""I despise"
1555,--VIRG.,An empire lost; I fling away the crown;
1556,--VIRG.,Numbers have laid that bright delusion down;
1557,--VIRG.,"But where's the Charles, or Dioclesian where,"
1558,--VIRG.,"Could quit the blooming, wedded, weeping fair?"
1559,--VIRG.,Oh! to dwell ever on thy lip! to stand
1560,--VIRG.,In full possession of thy snowy hand!
1561,--VIRG.,"And, thro' th' unclouded crystal of thine eye,"
1562,--VIRG.,The heavenly treasures of thy mind to spy!
1563,--VIRG.,"Till rapture reason happily destroys,"
1564,--VIRG.,And my soul wanders through immortal joys!
1565,--VIRG.,"Give me the world, and ask me, where's my bliss?"
1566,--VIRG.,"I clasp thee to my breast, and answer, this."
1567,--VIRG.,"And shall the grave""--He groans, and can no more;"
1568,--VIRG.,But all her charms in silence traces o'er;
1569,--VIRG.,"Her lip, her cheek, and eye, to wonder wrought;"
1570,--VIRG.,"And, wond'ring, sees, in sad presaging thought,"
1571,--VIRG.,"From that fair neck, that world of beauty fall,"
1572,--VIRG.,"And roll along the dust, a ghastly ball!"
1573,--VIRG.,"Oh! let those tremble, who are greatly bless'd!"
1574,--VIRG.,"For who, but Guilford, could be thus distress'd?"
1575,--VIRG.,"Come hither, all you happy, all you great,"
1576,--VIRG.,"From flowery meadows, and from rooms of state;"
1577,--VIRG.,"Nor think I call, your pleasures to destroy,"
1578,--VIRG.,"But to refine, and to exalt your joy:"
1579,--VIRG.,"Weep not; but, smiling, fix your ardent care"
1580,--VIRG.,On nobler titles than the brave or fair.
1581,--VIRG.,"Was ever such a mournful, moving sight?"
1582,--VIRG.,"See, if you can, by that dull, trembling light:"
1583,--VIRG.,"Now they embrace; and, mix'd with bitter woe,"
1584,--VIRG.,"Like Isis and her Thames, one stream they flow:"
1585,--VIRG.,"Now they start wide; fix'd in benumbing care,"
1586,--VIRG.,They stiffen into statues of despair:
1587,--VIRG.,"Now, tenderly severe, and fiercely kind,"
1588,--VIRG.,"They rush at once; they fling their cares behind,"
1589,--VIRG.,"And clasp, as if to death; new vows repeat;"
1590,--VIRG.,"And, quite wrapp'd up in love, forget their fate."
1591,--VIRG.,A short delusion! for the raging pain
1592,--VIRG.,Returns; and their poor hearts must bleed again.
1593,--VIRG.,"Meantime, the queen new cruelty decreed;"
1594,--VIRG.,"But, ill content that they should only bleed,"
1595,--VIRG.,"A priest is sent; who, with insidious art,"
1596,--VIRG.,Instills his poison into Suffolk's heart;
1597,--VIRG.,"And Guilford drank it: banging on the breast,"
1598,--VIRG.,He from his childhood was with Rome possest.
1599,--VIRG.,"When now the ministers of death draw nigh,"
1600,--VIRG.,"And in her dearest lord she first must die,"
1601,--VIRG.,"The subtle priest, who long had watch'd to find"
1602,--VIRG.,"The most unguarded passes of her mind,"
1603,--VIRG.,"Bespoke her thus: ""Grieve not; 'tis in your power"
1604,--VIRG.,"Your lord to rescue from this fatal hour."""
1605,--VIRG.,Her bosom pants; she draws her breath with pain;
1606,--VIRG.,A sudden horror thrills through every vein;
1607,--VIRG.,"Life seems suspended, on his words intent;"
1608,--VIRG.,And her soul trembles for the great event.
1609,--VIRG.,"The priest proceeds: ""Embrace the faith of Rome,"
1610,--VIRG.,"And ward your own, your lord's, and father's doom."""
1611,--VIRG.,Ye blessed spirits! now your charge sustain;
1612,--VIRG.,The past was ease; now first she suffers pain.
1613,--VIRG.,Must she pronounce her father's death? must she
1614,--VIRG.,"Bid Guilford bleed?--It must not, cannot, be."
1615,--VIRG.,"It cannot be! But 'tis the Christian's praise,"
1616,--VIRG.,Above impossibilities to raise
1617,--VIRG.,The weakness of our nature; and deride
1618,--VIRG.,Of vain philosophy the boasted pride.
1619,--VIRG.,What though our feeble sinews scarce impart
1620,--VIRG.,A moment's swiftness to the feather'd dart;
1621,--VIRG.,"Though tainted air our vig'rous youth can break,"
1622,--VIRG.,"And a chill blast the hardy warrior shake,"
1623,--VIRG.,Yet are we strong: hear the loud tempest roar
1624,--VIRG.,"From east to west, and call us weak no more;"
1625,--VIRG.,The lightning's unresisted force proclaims
1626,--VIRG.,Our might; and thunders raise our humble names;
1627,--VIRG.,'Tis our Jehovah fills the heavens; as long
1628,--VIRG.,"As he shall reign Almighty, we are strong:"
1629,--VIRG.,"We, by devotion, borrow from his throne;"
1630,--VIRG.,And almost make Omnipotence our own:
1631,--VIRG.,"We force the gates of heaven, by fervent prayer;"
1632,--VIRG.,And call forth triumph out of man's despair.
1633,--VIRG.,"Our lovely mourner, kneeling, lifts her eyes"
1634,--VIRG.,"And bleeding heart, in silence, to the skies,"
1635,--VIRG.,"Devoutly sad--then, bright'ning, like the day,"
1636,--VIRG.,"When sudden winds sweep scatter'd clouds away,"
1637,--VIRG.,"Shining in majesty, till now unknown,"
1638,--VIRG.,And breathing life and spirit scarce her own;
1639,--VIRG.,"She, rising, speaks: ""If these the terms----"""
1640,--VIRG.,"Here, Guilford, cruel Guilford, (barb'rous man!"
1641,--VIRG.,Is this thy love?) as swift as lightning ran;
1642,--VIRG.,"O'erwhelm'd her with tempestuous sorrow fraught,"
1643,--VIRG.,"And stifled, in its birth, the mighty thought;"
1644,--VIRG.,"Then bursting fresh into a flood of tears,"
1645,--VIRG.,"Fierce, resolute, delirious with his fears;"
1646,--VIRG.,"His fears for her alone: he beat his breast,"
1647,--VIRG.,And thus the fervour of his soul exprest:
1648,--VIRG.,"""Oh! let thy thought o'er our past converse rove,"
1649,--VIRG.,And show one moment uninflam'd with love!
1650,--VIRG.,"Oh! if thy kindness can no longer last,"
1651,--VIRG.,"In pity to thyself, forget the past!"
1652,--VIRG.,"Else wilt thou never, void of shame and fear,"
1653,--VIRG.,"Pronounce his doom, whom thou hast held so dear:"
1654,--VIRG.,"Thou who hast took me to thy arms, and swore"
1655,--VIRG.,"Empires were vile, and fate could give no more:"
1656,--VIRG.,"That to continue, was its utmost power,"
1657,--VIRG.,And make the future like the present hour.
1658,--VIRG.,Now call a ruffian; bid his cruel sword
1659,--VIRG.,Lay wide the bosom of thy worthless lord;
1660,--VIRG.,"Transfix his heart (since you its love disclaim),"
1661,--VIRG.,And stain his honour with a traitor's name.
1662,--VIRG.,This might perhaps be borne without remorse;
1663,--VIRG.,But sure a father's pangs will have their force!
1664,--VIRG.,"Shall his good age, so near its journey's end,"
1665,--VIRG.,Through cruel torment to the grave descend?
1666,--VIRG.,"His shallow blood all issue at a wound,"
1667,--VIRG.,"Wash a slave's feet, and smoke upon the ground?"
1668,--VIRG.,But he to you has ever been severe;
1669,--VIRG.,"Then take your vengeance""--Suffolk now drew near;"
1670,--VIRG.,Bending beneath the burden of his care;
1671,--VIRG.,"His robes neglected, and his head was bare;"
1672,--VIRG.,"Decrepid winter, in the yearly ring,"
1673,--VIRG.,"Thus slowly creeps, to meet the blooming spring:"
1674,--VIRG.,Downward he cast a melancholy look;
1675,--VIRG.,"Thrice turn'd, to hide his grief; then faintly spoke:"
1676,--VIRG.,"""Now deep in years, and forward in decay,"
1677,--VIRG.,That axe can only rob me of a day;
1678,--VIRG.,"For thee, my soul's desire! I can't refrain;"
1679,--VIRG.,"And shall my tears, my last tears, flow in vain?"
1680,--VIRG.,"When you shall know a mother's tender name,"
1681,--VIRG.,"My heart's distress no longer will you blame."""
1682,--VIRG.,"At this, afar his bursting groans were heard;"
1683,--VIRG.,The tears ran trickling down his silver beard:
1684,--VIRG.,"He snatch'd her hand, which to his lips he prest,"
1685,--VIRG.,And bid her plant a dagger in his breast;
1686,--VIRG.,"Then, sinking, call'd her piety unjust,"
1687,--VIRG.,And soil'd his hoary temples in the dust.
1688,--VIRG.,Hard-hearted men! will you no mercy know?
1689,--VIRG.,Has the queen brib'd you to distress her foe?
1690,--VIRG.,"O weak deserters to misfortune's part,"
1691,--VIRG.,By false affection thus to pierce her heart!
1692,--VIRG.,"When she had soar'd, to let your arrows fly,"
1693,--VIRG.,And fetch her bleeding from the middle sky!
1694,--VIRG.,"And can her virtue, springing from the ground,"
1695,--VIRG.,"Her flight recover, and disdain the wound,"
1696,--VIRG.,"When cleaving love, and human interest, bind"
1697,--VIRG.,The broken force of her aspiring mind;
1698,--VIRG.,"As round the gen'rous eagle, which in vain"
1699,--VIRG.,"Exerts her strength, the serpent wreaths his train,"
1700,--VIRG.,"Her struggling wings entangles, curling plies"
1701,--VIRG.,"His pois'nous tail, and stings her as she flies!"
1702,--VIRG.,"While yet the blow's first dreadful weight she feels,"
1703,--VIRG.,And with its force her resolution reels;
1704,--VIRG.,"Large doors, unfolding with a mournful sound,"
1705,--VIRG.,"To view discover, welt'ring on the ground,"
1706,--VIRG.,"Three headless trunks, of those whose arms maintain'd,"
1707,--VIRG.,And in her wars immortal glory gain'd:
1708,--VIRG.,"The lifted axe assur'd her ready doom,"
1709,--VIRG.,And silent mourners sadden'd all the room.
1710,--VIRG.,Shall I proceed; or here break off my tale;
1711,--VIRG.,"Nor truths, to stagger human faith, reveal?"
1712,--VIRG.,She met this utmost malice of her fate
1713,--VIRG.,"With Christian dignity, and pious state:"
1714,--VIRG.,"The beating storm's propitious rage she blest,"
1715,--VIRG.,And all the martyr triumph'd in her breast:
1716,--VIRG.,"Her lord and father, for a moment's space,"
1717,--VIRG.,She strictly folded in her soft embrace!
1718,--VIRG.,"Then thus she spoke, while angels heard on high,"
1719,--VIRG.,And sudden gladness smil'd along the sky:
1720,--VIRG.,"""Your over fondness has not mov'd my hate;"
1721,--VIRG.,I am well pleas'd you make my death so great;
1722,--VIRG.,I joy I cannot save you; and have giv'n
1723,--VIRG.,"Two lives, much dearer than my own, to heaven,"
1724,--VIRG.,If so the queen decrees:(4)--But I have cause
1725,--VIRG.,To hope my blood will satisfy the laws;
1726,--VIRG.,"And there is mercy still, for you, in store:"
1727,--VIRG.,With me the bitterness of death is o'er.
1728,--VIRG.,He shot his sting in that farewell embrace;
1729,--VIRG.,"And all, that is to come, is joy and peace."
1730,--VIRG.,"Then let mistaken sorrow be supprest,"
1731,--VIRG.,"Nor seem to envy my approaching rest."""
1732,--VIRG.,"Then, turning to the ministers of fate,"
1733,--VIRG.,"She, smiling, says, ""My victory complete:"
1734,--VIRG.,"And tell your queen, I thank her for the blow,"
1735,--VIRG.,And grieve my gratitude I cannot show:
1736,--VIRG.,"A poor return I leave in England's crown,"
1737,--VIRG.,"For everlasting pleasure, and renown:"
1738,--VIRG.,Her guilt alone allays this happy hour;
1739,--VIRG.,"Her guilt,--the only vengeance in her power."""
1740,--VIRG.,"Not Rome, untouch'd with sorrow, heard her fate;"
1741,--VIRG.,And fierce Maria pitied her too late.

1760,--HOR.,
1761,--HOR.,Preface.
1762,--HOR.,
1763,--HOR.,
1764,--HOR.,These satires have been favourably received at home and abroad. I am not
1765,--HOR.,conscious of the least malevolence to any particular person through all
1766,--HOR.,"the characters; though some persons may be so selfish, as to engross a"
1767,--HOR.,general application to themselves. A writer in polite letters should be
1768,--HOR.,content with reputation; the private amusement he finds in his
1769,--HOR.,compositions; the good influence they have on his severer studies; that
1770,--HOR.,admission they give him to his superiors; and the possible good effect
1771,--HOR.,they may have on the public; or else he should join to his politeness some
1772,--HOR.,more lucrative qualification.
1773,--HOR.,
1774,--HOR.,"But it is possible, that satire may not do much good: men may rise in"
1775,--HOR.,"their affections to their follies, as they do to their friends, when they"
1776,--HOR.,"are abused by others: it is much to be feared, that misconduct will never"
1777,--HOR.,be chased out of the world by satire; all therefore that is to be said for
1778,--HOR.,"it is, that misconduct will certainly be never chased out of the world by"
1779,--HOR.,"satire, if no satires are written: nor is that term unapplicable to graver"
1780,--HOR.,"compositions. Ethics, heathen and Christian, and the Scriptures"
1781,--HOR.,"themselves, are, in a great measure, a satire on the weakness and iniquity"
1782,--HOR.,"of men; and some part of that satire is in verse too: nay, in the first"
1783,--HOR.,"ages, philosophy and poetry were the same thing; wisdom wore no other"
1784,--HOR.,"dress: so that, I hope, these satires will be the more easily pardoned"
1785,--HOR.,"that misfortune by the severe. Nay, historians themselves may be"
1786,--HOR.,"considered as satirists, and satirists most severe; since such are most"
1787,--HOR.,"human actions, that to relate, is to expose them."
1788,--HOR.,
1789,--HOR.,"No man can converse much in the world, but, at what he meets with, he must"
1790,--HOR.,"either be insensible, or grieve, or be angry, or smile. Some passion (if"
1791,--HOR.,we are not impassive) must be moved; for the general conduct of mankind is
1792,--HOR.,by no means a thing indifferent to a reasonable and virtuous man. Now to
1793,--HOR.,"smile at it, and turn it into ridicule, I think most eligible; as it hurts"
1794,--HOR.,"ourselves least, and gives vice and folly the greatest offence: and that"
1795,--HOR.,"for this reason; because what men aim at by them, is, generally, public"
1796,--HOR.,opinion and esteem; which truth is the subject of the following satire;
1797,--HOR.,"and joins them together, as several brandies from the same root: a unity"
1798,--HOR.,"of design, which has not, I think, in a set of satires, been attempted"
1799,--HOR.,before.
1800,--HOR.,
1801,--HOR.,"Laughing at the misconduct of the world, will, in a great measure, ease us"
1802,--HOR.,of any more disagreeable passion about it. One passion is more effectually
1803,--HOR.,"driven out by another, than by reason; whatever some may teach: for to"
1804,--HOR.,"reason we owe our passions: had we not reason, we should not be offended"
1805,--HOR.,at what we find amiss: and the cause seems not to be the natural cure of
1806,--HOR.,any effect.
1807,--HOR.,
1808,--HOR.,"Moreover, laughing satire bids the fairest for success: the world is too"
1809,--HOR.,"proud to be fond of a serious tutor; and when an author is in a passion,"
1810,--HOR.,"the laugh, generally, as in conversation, turns against him. This kind of"
1811,--HOR.,satire only has any delicacy in it. Of this delicacy Horace is the best
1812,--HOR.,master: he appears in good humour while he censures; and therefore his
1813,--HOR.,"censure has the more weight, as supposed to proceed from judgment, not"
1814,--HOR.,from passion. Juvenal is ever in a passion; he has little valuable but his
1815,--HOR.,eloquence and morality: the last of which I have had in my eye: but rather
1816,--HOR.,"for emulation, than imitation, through my whole work."
1817,--HOR.,
1818,--HOR.,"But though I comparatively condemn Juvenal, in part of the sixth satire"
1819,--HOR.,"(where the occasion most required it), I endeavoured to touch on his"
1820,--HOR.,"manner; but was forced to quit it soon, as disagreeable to the writer, and"
1821,--HOR.,reader too. Boileau has joined both the Roman satirists with great
1822,--HOR.,"success; but has too much of Juvenal in his very serious satire on woman,"
1823,--HOR.,which should have been the gayest of all. An excellent critic of our own
1824,--HOR.,"commends Boileau's closeness, or, as he calls it, pressness, particularly;"
1825,--HOR.,"whereas, it appears to me, that repetition is his fault, if any fault"
1826,--HOR.,should be imputed to him.
1827,--HOR.,
1828,--HOR.,There are some prose satirists of the greatest delicacy and wit; the last
1829,--HOR.,"of which can never, or should never, succeed without the former. An author"
1830,--HOR.,"without it, betrays too great a contempt for mankind, and opinion of"
1831,--HOR.,"himself, which are bad advocates for reputation and success. What a"
1832,--HOR.,"difference is there between the merit, if not the wit, of Cervantes and"
1833,--HOR.,Rabelais? The last has a particular art of throwing a great deal of genius
1834,--HOR.,and learning into frolic and jest; but the genius and the scholar is all
1835,--HOR.,you can admire; you want the gentleman to converse with in him: he is like
1836,--HOR.,"a criminal who receives his life for some services; you commend, but you"
1837,--HOR.,"pardon too. Indecency offends our pride, as men; and our unaffected taste,"
1838,--HOR.,as judges of composition: nature has wisely formed us with an aversion to
1839,--HOR.,"it; and he that succeeds in spite of it, is,(5) aliena venia, quam sua"
1840,--HOR.,providentia tutior.
1841,--HOR.,
1842,--HOR.,"Such wits, like false oracles of old (which were wits and cheats), should"
1843,--HOR.,"set up for reputation among the weak, in some Boeotia, which was the land"
1844,--HOR.,"of oracles; for the wise will hold them in contempt. Some wits, too, like"
1845,--HOR.,"oracles, deal in ambiguities; but not with equal success: for though"
1846,--HOR.,"ambiguities are the first excellence of an impostor, they are the last of"
1847,--HOR.,a wit.
1848,--HOR.,
1849,--HOR.,"Some satirical wits and humourists, like their father Lucian, laugh at"
1850,--HOR.,"every thing indiscriminately; which betrays such a poverty of wit, as"
1851,--HOR.,"cannot afford to part with any thing; and such a want of virtue, as to"
1852,--HOR.,"postpone it to a jest. Such writers encourage vice and folly, which they"
1853,--HOR.,"pretend to combat, by setting them on an equal foot with better things:"
1854,--HOR.,"and while they labour to bring every thing into contempt, how can they"
1855,--HOR.,"expect their own parts should escape? Some French writers, particularly,"
1856,--HOR.,are guilty of this in matters of the last consequence; and some of our
1857,--HOR.,"own. They that are for lessening the true dignity of mankind, are not sure"
1858,--HOR.,"of being successful, but with regard to one individual in it. It is this"

1861,--HOR.,Which puts me in mind of Plato's fable of the birth of love; one of the
1862,--HOR.,prettiest fables of all antiquity; which will hold likewise with regard to
1863,--HOR.,"modern poetry. Love, says he, is the son of the goddess poverty, and the"
1864,--HOR.,god of riches: he has from his father his daring genius; his elevation of
1865,--HOR.,thought; his building castles in the air; his prodigality; his neglect of
1866,--HOR.,things serious and useful; his vain opinion of his own merit; and his
1867,--HOR.,affectation of preference and distinction: from his mother he inherits his
1868,--HOR.,"indigence, which makes him a constant beggar of favours; that importunity"
1869,--HOR.,with which he begs; his flattery; his servility; his fear of being
1870,--HOR.,"despised, which is inseparable from him. This addition may be made; viz."
1871,--HOR.,"that poetry, like love, is a little subject to blindness, which makes her"
1872,--HOR.,mistake her way to preferments and honours; that she has her satirical
1873,--HOR.,"quiver; and, lastly, that she retains a dutiful admiration of her father's"
1874,--HOR.,"family; but divides her favours, and generally lives with her mother's"
1875,--HOR.,relations.
1876,--HOR.,
1877,--HOR.,"However, this is not necessity, but choice: were wisdom her governess, she"

3164,MILTON.,The Sylvan race our active nymphs pursue;
3165,MILTON.,Man is not all the game they have in view:
3166,MILTON.,In woods and fields their glory they complete;
3167,MILTON.,Their Master Betty leaps a five-barr'd gate;
3168,MILTON.,"While fair Miss Charles to toilets is confin'd,"
3169,MILTON.,Nor rashly tempts the barb'rous sun and wind.
3170,MILTON.,"Some nymphs affect a more heroic breed,"
3171,MILTON.,And volt from hunters to the manag'd steed;
3172,MILTON.,"Command his prancings with a martial air,"
3173,MILTON.,And Fobert has the forming of the fair.
3174,MILTON.,"More than one steed must Delia's empire feel,"
3175,MILTON.,Who sits triumphant o'er the flying wheel;
3176,MILTON.,"And as she guides it thro' th' admiring throng,"
3177,MILTON.,With what an air she smacks the silken thong!
3178,MILTON.,"Graceful as John, she moderates the reins,"
3179,MILTON.,And whistles sweet her diuretic strains;
3180,MILTON.,"Sesostris like, such charioteers as these"
3181,MILTON.,"May drive six harness'd monarchs, if they please:"
3182,MILTON.,"They drive, row, run, with love of glory smit,"
3183,MILTON.,"Leap, swim, shoot flying, and pronounce on wit."
3184,MILTON.,O'er the belle-lettre lovely Daphne reigns;
3185,MILTON.,Again the god Apollo wears her chains:
3186,MILTON.,"With legs toss'd high, on her sophee she sits"
3187,MILTON.,Vouchsafing audience to contending wits:
3188,MILTON.,Of each performance she's the final test;
3189,MILTON.,"One act read o'er, she prophesies the rest;"
3190,MILTON.,"And then, pronouncing with decisive air,"
3191,MILTON.,Fully convinces all the town--she's fair.
3192,MILTON.,"Had lovely Daphne Hecatessa's face,"
3193,MILTON.,How would her elegance of taste decrease!
3194,MILTON.,"Some ladies' judgment in their features lies,"
3195,MILTON.,And all their genius sparkles from their eyes.
3196,MILTON.,"""But hold,"" she cries, ""lampooner! have a care;"
3197,MILTON.,"Must I want common sense, because I'm fair?"""
3198,MILTON.,O no: see Stella; her eyes shine as bright
3199,MILTON.,As if her tongue was never in the right;
3200,MILTON.,"And yet what real learning, judgment, fire!"
3201,MILTON.,"She seems inspir'd, and can herself inspire:"
3202,MILTON.,How then (if malice rul'd not all the fair)
3203,MILTON.,"Could Daphne publish, and could she forbear?"
3204,MILTON.,"We grant that beauty is no bar to sense,"
3205,MILTON.,Nor is't a sanction for impertinence.
3206,MILTON.,Sempronia lik'd her man; and well she might;
3207,MILTON.,"The youth in person, and in parts, was bright;"
3208,MILTON.,"Possess'd of every virtue, grace, and art,"
3209,MILTON.,That claims just empire o'er the female heart:
3210,MILTON.,"He met her passion, all her sighs return'd,"
3211,MILTON.,"And, in full rage of youthful ardour, burn'd:"
3212,MILTON.,"Large his possessions, and beyond her own:"
3213,MILTON.,"Their bliss the theme, and envy of the town:"
3214,MILTON.,"The day was fix'd, when, with one acre more,"
3215,MILTON.,"In stepp'd deform'd, debauch'd, diseas'd threescore."
3216,MILTON.,"The fatal sequel I, through shame, forbear:"
3217,MILTON.,"Of pride, and av'rice, who can cure the fair?"
3218,MILTON.,"Man's rich with little, were his judgment true;"
3219,MILTON.,"Nature is frugal, and her wants are few;"
3220,MILTON.,"Those few wants answer'd, bring sincere delights;"
3221,MILTON.,But fools create themselves new appetites:
3222,MILTON.,"Fancy, and pride, seek things at vast expense,"
3223,MILTON.,"Which relish not to reason, nor to sense."
3224,MILTON.,"When surfeit, or unthankfulness, destroys,"
3225,MILTON.,"In nature's narrow sphere, our solid joys,"
3226,MILTON.,"In fancy's airy land of noise and show,"
3227,MILTON.,"Where nought but dreams, no real pleasures, grow;"
3228,MILTON.,"Like cats in air-pumps, to subsist we strive"
3229,MILTON.,On joys too thin to keep the soul alive.
3230,MILTON.,Lemira's sick; make haste; the doctor call:
3231,MILTON.,He comes; but where's his patient? At the ball.
3232,MILTON.,"The doctor stares; her woman curtsies low,"
3233,MILTON.,"And cries, ""My lady, Sir, is always so:"
3234,MILTON.,Diversions put her maladies to flight:
3235,MILTON.,"True, she can't stand, but she can dance all night:"
3236,MILTON.,I've known my lady (for she loves a tune)
3237,MILTON.,For fevers take an opera in June:
3238,MILTON.,"And, tho' perhaps you'll think the practice bold,"
3239,MILTON.,A midnight park is sov'reign for a cold:
3240,MILTON.,"With cholics, breakfasts of green fruit agree;"
3241,MILTON.,"With indigestions, supper just at three."""
3242,MILTON.,"A strange alternative, replies Sir Hans,"
3243,MILTON.,"Must women have a doctor, or a dance?"
3244,MILTON.,"Though sick to death, abroad they safely roam,"
3245,MILTON.,"But droop and die, in perfect health, at home:"
3246,MILTON.,"For want--but not of health, are ladies ill;"
3247,MILTON.,And tickets cure beyond the doctor's pill.
3248,MILTON.,"Alas, my heart! how languishingly fair"
3249,MILTON.,Yon lady lolls! with what a tender air!
3250,MILTON.,"Pale as a young dramatic author, when,"
3251,MILTON.,"O'er darling lines, fell Cibber waves his pen."
3252,MILTON.,"Is her lord angry, or has(14) Veny chid?"
3253,MILTON.,"Dead is her father, or the mask forbid?"
3254,MILTON.,"""Late sitting up has turn'd her roses white."""
3255,MILTON.,"Why went she not to bed? ""Because 'twas night."""
3256,MILTON.,"Did she then dance, or play? ""Nor this, nor that."""
3257,MILTON.,"Well, night soon steals away in pleasing chat."
3258,MILTON.,"""No, all alone, her prayers she rather chose,"
3259,MILTON.,"Than be that wretch to sleep till morning rose."""
3260,MILTON.,"Then lady Cynthia, mistress of the shade,"
3261,MILTON.,"Goes, with the fashionable owls, to bed:"
3262,MILTON.,"This her pride covets, this her health denies;"
3263,MILTON.,"Her soul is silly, but her body's wise."
3264,MILTON.,"Others, with curious arts, dim charms revive,"
3265,MILTON.,And triumph in the bloom of fifty-five.
3266,MILTON.,"You, in the morning, a fair nymph invite;"
3267,MILTON.,"To keep her word, a brown one comes at night:"
3268,MILTON.,Next day she shines in glossy black; and then
3269,MILTON.,Revolves into her native red again:
3270,MILTON.,"Like a dove's neck, she shifts her transient charms,"
3271,MILTON.,And is her own dear rival in your arms.
3272,MILTON.,But one admirer has the painted lass;
3273,MILTON.,"Nor finds that one, but in her looking-glass:"
3274,MILTON.,"Yet Laura's beautiful to such excess,"
3275,MILTON.,That all her art scarce makes her please us less.
3276,MILTON.,"To deck the female cheek, he only knows,"
3277,MILTON.,"Who paints less fair the lily, and the rose."
3278,MILTON.,"How gay they smile! Such blessings nature pours,"
3279,MILTON.,O'erstock'd mankind enjoy but half her stores:
3280,MILTON.,"In distant wilds, by human eyes unseen,"
3281,MILTON.,"She rears her flowers, and spreads her velvet green:"
3282,MILTON.,"Pure gurgling rills the lonely desert trace,"
3283,MILTON.,And waste their music on the savage race.
3284,MILTON.,Is nature then a niggard of her bliss?
3285,MILTON.,Repine we guiltless in a world like this?
3286,MILTON.,"But our lewd tastes her lawful charms refuse,"
3287,MILTON.,And painted art's depraved allurements choose.
3288,MILTON.,Such Fulvia's passion for the town; fresh air
3289,MILTON.,(An odd effect!) gives vapours to the fair;
3290,MILTON.,"Green fields, and shady groves, and crystal springs,"
3291,MILTON.,"And larks, and nightingales, are odious things;"
3292,MILTON.,"But smoke, and dust, and noise, and crowds, delight;"
3293,MILTON.,"And to be press'd to death, transports her quite:"
3294,MILTON.,"Where silver riv'lets play through flow'ry meads,"
3295,MILTON.,"And woodbines give their sweets, and limes their shades,"
3296,MILTON.,"Black kennels' absent odours she regrets,"
3297,MILTON.,And stops her nose at beds of violets.
3298,MILTON.,Is stormy life preferr'd to the serene?
3299,MILTON.,Or is the public to the private scene?
3300,MILTON.,"Retir'd, we tread a smooth and open way;"
3301,MILTON.,Through briers and brambles in the world we stray;
3302,MILTON.,"Stiff opposition, and perplex'd debate,"
3303,MILTON.,"And thorny care, and rank and stinging hate,"
3304,MILTON.,"Which choke our passage, our career control,"
3305,MILTON.,And wound the firmest temper of our soul.
3306,MILTON.,O sacred solitude! divine retreat!
3307,MILTON.,Choice of the prudent! envy of the great!
3308,MILTON.,"By thy pure stream, or in thy waving shade,"
3309,MILTON.,"We court fair wisdom, that celestial maid:"
3310,MILTON.,"The genuine offspring of her lov'd embrace,"
3311,MILTON.,(Strangers on earth!) are innocence and peace:
3312,MILTON.,"There, from the ways of men laid safe ashore,"
3313,MILTON.,We smile to hear the distant tempest roar;
3314,MILTON.,"There, bless'd with health, with business unperplex'd,"
3315,MILTON.,"This life we relish, and ensure the next;"
3316,MILTON.,"There too the muses sport; these numbers free,"
3317,MILTON.,Pierian Eastbury! I owe to thee.
3318,MILTON.,There sport the muses; but not there alone:
3319,MILTON.,Their sacred force Amelia feels in town.
3320,MILTON.,Nought but a genius can a genius fit;
3321,MILTON.,"A wit herself, Amelia weds a wit:"
3322,MILTON.,"Both wits! though miracles are said to cease,"
3323,MILTON.,"Three days, three wondrous days! they liv'd in peace;"
3324,MILTON.,"With the fourth sun a warm dispute arose,"
3325,MILTON.,"On Durfey's poesy, and Bunyan's prose:"
3326,MILTON.,"The learned war both wage with equal force,"
3327,MILTON.,And the fifth morn concluded the divorce.
3328,MILTON.,"Phoebe, though she possesses nothing less,"
3329,MILTON.,Is proud of being rich in happiness:
3330,MILTON.,"Laboriously pursues delusive toys,"
3331,MILTON.,"Content with pains, since they're reputed joys."
3332,MILTON.,"With what well-acted transport will she say,"
3333,MILTON.,"""Well, sure, we were so happy yesterday!"
3334,MILTON.,"And then that charming party for to-morrow!"""
3335,MILTON.,"Though, well she knows, 'twill languish into sorrow:"
3336,MILTON.,But she dares never boast the present hour;
3337,MILTON.,"So gross that cheat, it is beyond her power:"
3338,MILTON.,"For such is or our weakness, or our curse,"
3339,MILTON.,"Or rather such our crime, which still is worse,"
3340,MILTON.,"The present moment, like a wife, we shun,"
3341,MILTON.,"And ne'er enjoy, because it is our own."
3342,MILTON.,"Pleasures are few, and fewer we enjoy;"
3343,MILTON.,"Pleasure, like quicksilver, is bright, and coy;"
3344,MILTON.,"We strive to grasp it with our utmost skill,"
3345,MILTON.,"Still it eludes us, and it glitters still:"
3346,MILTON.,"If seiz'd at last, compute your mighty gains;"
3347,MILTON.,"What is it, but rank poison in your veins?"
3348,MILTON.,"As Flavia in her glass an angel spies,"
3349,MILTON.,Pride whispers in her ear pernicious lies;
3350,MILTON.,"Tells her, while she surveys a face so fine,"
3351,MILTON.,There's no satiety of charms divine:
3352,MILTON.,"Hence, if her lover yawns, all chang'd appears"
3353,MILTON.,"Her temper, and she melts (sweet soul!) in tears:"
3354,MILTON.,"She, fond and young, last week, her wish enjoy'd,"
3355,MILTON.,In soft amusement all the night employ'd;
3356,MILTON.,"The morning came, when Strephon, waking, found"
3357,MILTON.,(Surprising sight!) his bride in sorrow drown'd.
3358,MILTON.,"""What miracle,"" says Strephon, ""makes thee weep?"""
3359,MILTON.,"""Ah, barb'rous man!"" she cries, ""how could you----sleep?"""
3360,MILTON.,"Men love a mistress, as they love a feast;"
3361,MILTON.,"How grateful one to touch, and one to taste!"
3362,MILTON.,"Yet sure there is a certain time of day,"
3363,MILTON.,"We wish our mistress, and our meat, away:"
3364,MILTON.,"But soon the sated appetites return,"
3365,MILTON.,"Again our stomachs crave, our bosoms burn:"
3366,MILTON.,"Eternal love let man, then, never swear;"
3367,MILTON.,"Let women never triumph, nor despair;"
3368,MILTON.,"Nor praise, nor blame, too much, the warm, or chill;"
3369,MILTON.,Hunger and love are foreign to the will.
3370,MILTON.,"There is indeed a passion more refin'd,"
3371,MILTON.,For those few nymphs whose charms are of the mind:
3372,MILTON.,But not of that unfashionable set
3373,MILTON.,Is Phyllis; Phyllis and her Damon met.
3374,MILTON.,Eternal love exactly hits her taste;
3375,MILTON.,Phyllis demands eternal love at least.
3376,MILTON.,"Embracing Phyllis with soft smiling eyes,"
3377,MILTON.,"Eternal love I vow, the swain replies:"
3378,MILTON.,"But say, my all, my mistress, and my friend!"
3379,MILTON.,What day next week th' eternity shall end?
3380,MILTON.,Some nymphs prefer astronomy to love:
3381,MILTON.,"Elope from mortal man, and range above."
3382,MILTON.,"The fair philosopher to Rowley flies,"
3383,MILTON.,"Where, in a box, the whole creation lies:"
3384,MILTON.,"She sees the planets in their turns advance,"
3385,MILTON.,"And scorns, Poitier, thy sublunary dance;"
3386,MILTON.,Of Desagulier she bespeaks fresh air;
3387,MILTON.,And Whiston has engagements with the fair.
3388,MILTON.,What vain experiments Sophronia tries!
3389,MILTON.,'Tis not in air-pumps the gay colonel dies.
3390,MILTON.,"But though to-day this rage of science reigns,"
3391,MILTON.,(O fickle sex!) soon end her learned pains.
3392,MILTON.,"Lo! Pug from Jupiter her heart has got,"
3393,MILTON.,"Turns out the stars, and Newton is a sot."
3394,MILTON.,To----turn; she never took the height
3395,MILTON.,"Of Saturn, yet is ever in the right."
3396,MILTON.,"She strikes each point with native force of mind,"
3397,MILTON.,"While puzzled learning blunders far behind,"
3398,MILTON.,"Graceful to sight, and elegant to thought,"
3399,MILTON.,"The great are vanquish'd, and the wise are taught."
3400,MILTON.,"Her breeding finish'd, and her temper sweet,"
3401,MILTON.,"When serious, easy; and when gay, discreet;"
3402,MILTON.,"In glittering scenes, o'er her own heart, sincere;"
3403,MILTON.,"In crowds, collected; and in courts, severe;"
3404,MILTON.,"Sincere, and warm, with zeal well understood,"
3405,MILTON.,She takes a noble pride in doing good;
3406,MILTON.,"Yet not superior to her sex's cares,"
3407,MILTON.,The mode she fixes by the gown she wears;
3408,MILTON.,Of silks and china she's the last appeal;
3409,MILTON.,In these great points she leads the commonweal;
3410,MILTON.,And if disputes of empire rise between
3411,MILTON.,"Mechlin the queen of lace, and colberteen,"
3412,MILTON.,'Tis doubt! 'tis darkness! till suspended fate
3413,MILTON.,"Assumes her nod, to close the grand debate."
3414,MILTON.,"When such her mind, why will the fair express"
3415,MILTON.,Their emulation only in their dress?
3416,MILTON.,"But, oh! the nymph that mounts above the skies,"
3417,MILTON.,"And, gratis, clears religious mysteries,"
3418,MILTON.,"Resolv'd the church's welfare to ensure,"
3419,MILTON.,And make her family a sine-cure:
3420,MILTON.,"The theme divine at cards she'll not forget,"
3421,MILTON.,But takes in texts of Scripture at picquet;
3422,MILTON.,"In those licentious meetings acts the prude,"
3423,MILTON.,And thanks her Maker that her cards are good.
3424,MILTON.,"What angels would those be, who thus excel"
3425,MILTON.,"In theologies, could they sew as well!"
3426,MILTON.,Yet why should not the fair her text pursue?
3427,MILTON.,Can she more decently the doctor woo?
3428,MILTON.,"'Tis hard, too, she who makes no use but chat"
3429,MILTON.,"Of her religion, should be barr'd in that."
3430,MILTON.,"Isaac, a brother of the canting strain,"
3431,MILTON.,"When he has knock'd at his own skull in vain,"
3432,MILTON.,To beauteous Marcia often will repair
3433,MILTON.,"With a dark text, to light it at the fair."
3434,MILTON.,O how his pious soul exults to find
3435,MILTON.,Such love for holy men in woman-kind!
3436,MILTON.,"Charm'd with her learning, with what rapture he"
3437,MILTON.,"Hangs on her bloom, like an industrious bee!"
3438,MILTON.,"Hums round about her, and with all his power"
3439,MILTON.,Extracts sweet wisdom from so fair a flower!
3440,MILTON.,"The young and gay declining, Appia flies"
3441,MILTON.,"At nobler game, the mighty and the wise:"
3442,MILTON.,"By nature more an eagle than a dove,"
3443,MILTON.,She impiously prefers the world to love.
3444,MILTON.,"Can wealth give happiness? look round, and see"
3445,MILTON.,What gay distress! what splendid misery!
3446,MILTON.,"Whatever fortune lavishly can pour,"
3447,MILTON.,"The mind annihilates, and calls for more!"
3448,MILTON.,Wealth is a cheat; believe not what it says;
3449,MILTON.,Like any lord it promises--and pays.
3450,MILTON.,"How will the miser startle, to be told"
3451,MILTON.,"Of such a wonder, as insolvent gold!"
3452,MILTON.,What nature wants has an intrinsic weight;
3453,MILTON.,"All more, is but the fashion of the plate,"
3454,MILTON.,"Which, for one moment, charms the fickle view;"
3455,MILTON.,It charms us now; anon we cast anew;
3456,MILTON.,To some fresh birth of fancy more inclin'd:
3457,MILTON.,"Then wed not acres, but a noble mind."
3458,MILTON.,"Mistaken lovers, who make worth their care,"
3459,MILTON.,And think accomplishments will win the fair:
3460,MILTON.,"The fair, 'tis true, by genius should be won,"
3461,MILTON.,As flow'rs unfold their beauties to the sun;
3462,MILTON.,"And yet in female scales a fop outweighs,"
3463,MILTON.,And wit must wear the willow and the bays.
3464,MILTON.,Nought shines so bright in vain Liberia's eye
3465,MILTON.,"As riot, impudence, and perfidy;"
3466,MILTON.,"The youth of fire, that has drunk deep, and play'd,"
3467,MILTON.,"And kill'd his man, and triumph'd o'er his maid;"
3468,MILTON.,"For him, as yet unhang'd, she spreads her charms,"
3469,MILTON.,Snatches the dear destroyer to her arms;
3470,MILTON.,And amply gives (though treated long amiss)
3471,MILTON.,"The man of merit his revenge in this,"
3472,MILTON.,"If you resent, and wish a woman ill,"
3473,MILTON.,But turn her o'er one moment to her will.
3474,MILTON.,"The languid lady next appears in state,"
3475,MILTON.,Who was not born to carry her own weight;
3476,MILTON.,"She lolls, reels, staggers, till some foreign aid"
3477,MILTON.,To her own stature lifts the feeble maid.
3478,MILTON.,"Then, if ordain'd to so severe a doom,"
3479,MILTON.,"She, by just stages, journeys round the room:"
3480,MILTON.,"But, knowing her own weakness, she despairs"
3481,MILTON.,"To scale the Alps--that is, ascend the stairs."
3482,MILTON.,"My fan! let others say, who laugh at toil;"
3483,MILTON.,Fan! hood! glove! scarf! is her laconic style;
3484,MILTON.,"And that is spoke with such a dying fall,"
3485,MILTON.,"That Betty rather sees, than hears the call:"
3486,MILTON.,"The motion of her lips, and meaning eye,"
3487,MILTON.,Piece out th' idea her faint words deny.
3488,MILTON.,O listen with attention most profound!
3489,MILTON.,Her voice is but the shadow of a sound.
3490,MILTON.,"And help! oh help! her spirits are so dead,"
3491,MILTON.,One hand scarce lifts the other to her head.
3492,MILTON.,"If, there, a stubborn pin it triumphs o'er,"
3493,MILTON.,She pants! she sinks away! and is more.
3494,MILTON.,"Let the robust and the gigantic carve,"
3495,MILTON.,"Life is not worth so much, she'd rather starve;"
3496,MILTON.,But chew she must herself; ah cruel fate!
3497,MILTON.,That Rosalinda can't by proxy eat.
3498,MILTON.,An antidote in female caprice lies
3499,MILTON.,(Kind heaven!) against the poison of their eyes.
3500,MILTON.,Thalestris triumphs in a manly mien;
3501,MILTON.,"Loud is her accent, and her phrase obscene."
3502,MILTON.,In fair and open dealing where's the shame?
3503,MILTON.,"What nature dares to give, she dares to name."
3504,MILTON.,"This honest fellow is sincere and plain,"
3505,MILTON.,And justly gives the jealous husband pain.
3506,MILTON.,"(Vain is the task to petticoats assign'd,"
3507,MILTON.,If wanton language shows a naked mind.)
3508,MILTON.,"And now and then, to grace her eloquence,"
3509,MILTON.,An oath supplies the vacancies of sense.
3510,MILTON.,"Hark! the shrill notes transpierce the yielding air,"
3511,MILTON.,And teach the neighb'ring echoes how to swear.
3512,MILTON.,"By Jove, is faint, and for the simple swain;"
3513,MILTON.,"She, on the Christian system, is profane."
3514,MILTON.,"But though the volley rattles in your ear,"
3515,MILTON.,"Believe her dress, she's not a grenadier."
3516,MILTON.,"If thunder's awful, how much more our dread,"
3517,MILTON.,When Jove deputes a lady in his stead?
3518,MILTON.,"A lady! pardon my mistaken pen,"
3519,MILTON.,A shameless woman is the worst of men.
3520,MILTON.,Few to good breeding make a just pretence;
3521,MILTON.,Good breeding is the blossom of good sense;
3522,MILTON.,"The last result of an accomplish'd mind,"
3523,MILTON.,"With outward grace, the body's virtue, join'd."
3524,MILTON.,A violated decency now reigns;
3525,MILTON.,And nymphs for failings take peculiar pains.
3526,MILTON.,"With Chinese painters modern toasts agree,"
3527,MILTON.,The point they aim at is deformity:
3528,MILTON.,They throw their persons with a hoyden air
3529,MILTON.,"Across the room, and toss into the chair."
3530,MILTON.,"So far their commerce with mankind is gone,"
3531,MILTON.,"They, for our manners, have exchang'd their own."
3532,MILTON.,"The modest look, the castigated grace,"
3533,MILTON.,"The gentle movement, and slow measur'd pace,"
3534,MILTON.,"For which her lovers died, her parents pray'd,"
3535,MILTON.,Are indecorums with the modern maid.
3536,MILTON.,"Stiff forms are bad; but let not worse intrude,"
3537,MILTON.,"Nor conquer art and nature, to be rude."
3538,MILTON.,"Modern good-breeding carry to its height,"
3539,MILTON.,And lady D----'s self will be polite.
3540,MILTON.,Ye rising fair! ye bloom of Britain's isle!
3541,MILTON.,"When high-born Anna, with a soften'd smile,"
3542,MILTON.,"Leads on your train, and sparkles at your head,"
3543,MILTON.,"What seems most hard, is, not to be well bred."
3544,MILTON.,"Her bright example with success pursue,"
3545,MILTON.,"And all, but adoration, is your due."
3546,MILTON.,"But adoration! give me something more,"
3547,MILTON.,"Cries Lyce, on the borders of threescore:"
3548,MILTON.,Nought treads so silent as the foot of time;
3549,MILTON.,Hence we mistake our autumn for our prime;
3550,MILTON.,"'Tis greatly wise to know, before we're told,"
3551,MILTON.,"The melancholy news, that we grow old."
3552,MILTON.,Autumnal Lyce carries in her face
3553,MILTON.,Memento mori to each public place.
3554,MILTON.,"O how your beating breast a mistress warms,"
3555,MILTON.,Who looks through spectacles to see your charms!
3556,MILTON.,"While rival undertakers hover round,"
3557,MILTON.,"And with his spade the sexton marks the ground,"
3558,MILTON.,"Intent not on her own, but others' doom,"
3559,MILTON.,"She plans new conquests, and defrauds the tomb."
3560,MILTON.,"In vain the cock has summon'd sprites away,"
3561,MILTON.,"She walks at noon, and blasts the bloom of day."
3562,MILTON.,"Gay rainbow silks her mellow charms infold,"
3563,MILTON.,And nought of Lyce but herself is old.
3564,MILTON.,"Her grizzled locks assume a smirking grace,"
3565,MILTON.,And art has levell'd her deep-furrow'd face.
3566,MILTON.,"Her strange demand no mortal can approve,"
3567,MILTON.,"We'll ask her blessing, but can't ask her love."
3568,MILTON.,"She grants, indeed, a lady may decline"
3569,MILTON.,(All ladies but herself) at ninety-nine.
3570,MILTON.,O how unlike her is the sacred age
3571,MILTON.,Of prudent Portia! her gray hairs engage;
3572,MILTON.,Whose thoughts are suited to her life's decline:
3573,MILTON.,Virtue's the paint that can with wrinkles shine.
3574,MILTON.,"That, and that only, can old age sustain;"
3575,MILTON.,"Which yet all wish, nor know they wish for pain."
3576,MILTON.,"Not num'rous are our joys, when life is new;"
3577,MILTON.,And yearly some are falling of the few;
3578,MILTON.,"But when we conquer life's meridian stage,"
3579,MILTON.,"And downward tend into the vale of age,"
3580,MILTON.,"They drop apace; by nature some decay,"
3581,MILTON.,And some the blasts of fortune sweep away;
3582,MILTON.,"Till naked quite of happiness, aloud"
3583,MILTON.,"We call for death, and shelter in a shroud."
3584,MILTON.,Where's Portia now?--But Portia left behind
3585,MILTON.,Two lovely copies of her form and mind.
3586,MILTON.,"What heart untouch'd their early grief can view,"
3587,MILTON.,Like blushing rose-buds dipp'd in morning dew?
3588,MILTON.,"Who into shelter takes their tender bloom,"
3589,MILTON.,And forms their minds to flee from ills to come?
3590,MILTON.,"The mind, when turn'd adrift, no rules to guide,"
3591,MILTON.,Drives at the mercy of the wind and tide;
3592,MILTON.,Fancy and passion toss it to and fro;
3593,MILTON.,"Awhile torment, and then quite sink in woe."
3594,MILTON.,"Ye beauteous orphans, since in silent dust"
3595,MILTON.,"Your best example lies, my precepts trust."
3596,MILTON.,Life swarms with ills; the boldest are afraid;
3597,MILTON.,Where then is safety for a tender maid?
3598,MILTON.,"Unfit for conflict, round beset with woes,"
3599,MILTON.,"And man, whom least she fears, her worst of foes!"
3600,MILTON.,"When kind, most cruel; when oblig'd the most,"
3601,MILTON.,The least obliging; and by favours lost.
3602,MILTON.,"Cruel by nature, they for kindness hate;"
3603,MILTON.,And scorn you for those ills themselves create.
3604,MILTON.,"If on your fame your sex a blot has thrown,"
3605,MILTON.,"'Twill ever stick, through malice of your own."
3606,MILTON.,Most hard! in pleasing your chief glory lies;
3607,MILTON.,And yet from pleasing your chief dangers rise:
3608,MILTON.,"Then please the best; and know, for men of sense,"
3609,MILTON.,Your strongest charms are native innocence.
3610,MILTON.,"Art on the mind, like paint upon the face,"
3611,MILTON.,"Fright him, that's worth your love, from your embrace."
3612,MILTON.,In simple manners all the secret lies;
3613,MILTON.,"Be kind and virtuous, you'll be blest and wise."
3614,MILTON.,"Vain show and noise intoxicate the brain,"
3615,MILTON.,"Begin with giddiness, and end in pain."
3616,MILTON.,"Affect not empty fame, and idle praise,"
3617,MILTON.,"Which, all those wretches I describe, betrays."
3618,MILTON.,"Your sex's glory 'tis, to shine unknown;"
3619,MILTON.,"Of all applause, be fondest of your own."
3620,MILTON.,Beware the fever of the mind! that thirst
3621,MILTON.,With which the age is eminently curst:
3622,MILTON.,"To drink of pleasure, but inflames desire;"
3623,MILTON.,And abstinence alone can quench the fire;
3624,MILTON.,"Take pain from life, and terror from the tomb;"
3625,MILTON.,Give peace in hand; and promise bliss to come.

3642,--HOR.,
3643,--HOR.,
3644,--HOR.,"I sought a patroness, but sought in vain."
3645,--HOR.,"Apollo whisper'd in my ear--""Germain.""--"
3646,--HOR.,"I know her not.--""Your reason's somewhat odd;"
3647,--HOR.,"Who knows his patron, now?"" replied the god."
3648,--HOR.,"""Men write, to me, and to the world, unknown;"
3649,--HOR.,"Then steal great names, to shield them from the town."
3650,--HOR.,"Detected worth, like beauty disarray'd,"
3651,--HOR.,"To covert flies, of praise itself afraid:"
3652,--HOR.,"Should she refuse to patronize your lays,"
3653,--HOR.,In vengeance write a volume in her praise.
3654,--HOR.,Nor think it hard so great a length to run;
3655,--HOR.,"When such the theme, 'twill easily be done."""
3656,--HOR.,"Ye fair! to draw your excellence at length,"
3657,--HOR.,Exceeds the narrow bounds of human strength;
3658,--HOR.,"You, here, in miniature your picture see;"
3659,--HOR.,Nor hope from Zincks more justice than from me.
3660,--HOR.,"My portraits grace your mind, as his your side;"
3661,--HOR.,"His portraits will inflame, mine quench, your pride."
3662,--HOR.,"He's dear, you frugal; choose my cheaper lay;"
3663,--HOR.,And be your reformation all my pay.
3664,--HOR.,"Lavinia is polite, but not profane;"
3665,--HOR.,To church as constant as to Drury Lane.
3666,--HOR.,"She decently, in form, pays heaven its due;"
3667,--HOR.,And makes a civil visit to her pew.
3668,--HOR.,"Her lifted fan, to give a solemn air,"
3669,--HOR.,"Conceals her face, which passes for a prayer:"
3670,--HOR.,"Curtsies to curtsies, then, with grace, succeed;"
3671,--HOR.,"Not one the fair omits, but at the creed."
3672,--HOR.,"Or if she joins the service, 'tis to speak;"
3673,--HOR.,Thro' dreadful silence the pent heart might break;
3674,--HOR.,"Untaught to bear it, women talk away"
3675,--HOR.,"To God himself, and fondly think they pray."
3676,--HOR.,"But sweet their accent, and their air refin'd;"
3677,--HOR.,For they're before their Maker--and mankind:
3678,--HOR.,"When ladies once are proud of praying well,"
3679,--HOR.,Satan himself will toll the parish bell.
3680,--HOR.,"Acquainted with the world, and quite well bred,"
3681,--HOR.,Drusa receives her visitants in bed;
3682,--HOR.,"But, chaste as ice, this Vesta, to defy"
3683,--HOR.,"The very blackest tongue of calumny,"
3684,--HOR.,"When from the sheets her lovely form she lifts,"
3685,--HOR.,"She begs you just would turn you, while she shifts."
3686,--HOR.,"Those charms are greatest which decline the sight,"
3687,--HOR.,That makes the banquet poignant and polite.
3688,--HOR.,"There is no woman, where there's no reserve;"
3689,--HOR.,And 'tis on plenty your poor lovers starve.
3690,--HOR.,"But with a modern fair, meridian merit"
3691,--HOR.,"Is a fierce thing, they call a nymph of spirit."
3692,--HOR.,Mark well the rollings of her flaming eye;
3693,--HOR.,"And tread on tiptoe, if you dare draw nigh."
3694,--HOR.,"""Or if you take a lion by the beard,(15)"
3695,--HOR.,"Or dare defy the fell Hyrcanian pard,"
3696,--HOR.,"Or arm'd rhinoceros, or rough Russian bear,"""
3697,--HOR.,"First make your will, and then converse with her."
3698,--HOR.,This lady glories in profuse expense;
3699,--HOR.,And thinks distraction is magnificence.
3700,--HOR.,"To beggar her gallant, is some delight;"
3701,--HOR.,"To be more fatal still, is exquisite;"
3702,--HOR.,Had ever nymph such reason to be glad?
3703,--HOR.,In duel fell two lovers; one run mad.
3704,--HOR.,Her foes their honest execrations pour;
3705,--HOR.,Her lovers only should detest her more.
3706,--HOR.,"Flavia is constant to her old gallant,"
3707,--HOR.,And generously supports him in his want;
3708,--HOR.,"But marriage is a fetter, is a snare,"
3709,--HOR.,"A hell, no lady so polite can bear."
3710,--HOR.,"She's faithful, she's observant, and with pains"
3711,--HOR.,Her angel brood of bastards she maintains.
3712,--HOR.,"Nor least advantage has the fair to plead,"
3713,--HOR.,"But that of guilt, above the marriage-bed."
3714,--HOR.,"Amasia hates a prude, and scorns restraint;"
3715,--HOR.,"Whate'er she is, she'll not appear a saint:"
3716,--HOR.,Her soul superior flies formality;
3717,--HOR.,"So gay her air, her conduct is so free,"
3718,--HOR.,Some might suspect the nymph not over good--
3719,--HOR.,"Nor would they be mistaken, if they should."
3720,--HOR.,Unmarried Abra puts on formal airs;
3721,--HOR.,Her cushion's threadbare with her constant prayers.
3722,--HOR.,"Her only grief is, that she cannot be"
3723,--HOR.,At once engag'd in prayer and charity.
3724,--HOR.,"And this, to do her justice, must be said,"
3725,--HOR.,"""Who would not think that Abra was a maid?"""
3726,--HOR.,Some ladies are too beauteous to be wed;
3727,--HOR.,For where's the man that's worthy of their bed?
3728,--HOR.,"If no disease reduce her pride before,"
3729,--HOR.,Lavinia will be ravish'd at threescore.
3730,--HOR.,Then she submits to venture in the dark;
3731,--HOR.,And nothing now is wanting--but her spark.
3732,--HOR.,Lucia thinks happiness consists in state;
3733,--HOR.,"She weds an idiot, but she eats in plate."
3734,--HOR.,"The goods of fortune, which her soul possess,"
3735,--HOR.,Are but the ground of unmade happiness;
3736,--HOR.,"The rude material: wisdom add to this,"
3737,--HOR.,"Wisdom, the sole artificer of bliss;"
3738,--HOR.,"She from herself, if so compell'd by need,"
3739,--HOR.,Of thin content can draw the subtle thread;
3740,--HOR.,But (no detraction to her sacred skill)
3741,--HOR.,"If she can work in gold, 'tis better still."
3742,--HOR.,"If Tullia had been blest with half her sense,"
3743,--HOR.,None could too much admire her excellence:
3744,--HOR.,"But since she can make error shine so bright,"
3745,--HOR.,She thinks it vulgar to defend the right.
3746,--HOR.,With understanding she is quite o'errun;
3747,--HOR.,And by too great accomplishments undone:
3748,--HOR.,"With skill she vibrates her eternal tongue,"
3749,--HOR.,For ever most divinely in the wrong.
3750,--HOR.,Naked in nothing should a woman be;
3751,--HOR.,But veil her very wit with modesty:
3752,--HOR.,"Let man discover, let not her display,"
3753,--HOR.,But yield her charms of mind with sweet delay.
3754,--HOR.,"For pleasure form'd, perversely some believe,"
3755,--HOR.,"To make themselves important, men must grieve."
3756,--HOR.,"Lesbia the fair, to fire her jealous lord,"
3757,--HOR.,"Pretends, the fop she laughs at, is ador'd."
3758,--HOR.,In vain she's proud of secret innocence;
3759,--HOR.,The fact she fains were scarce a worse offence.
3760,--HOR.,"Mira, endow'd with every charm to bless,"
3761,--HOR.,"Has no design, but on her husband's peace:"
3762,--HOR.,He lov'd her much; and greatly was he mov'd
3763,--HOR.,At small inquietudes in her he lov'd.
3764,--HOR.,"""How charming this!""--The pleasure lasted long;"
3765,--HOR.,Now every day the fits come thick and strong:
3766,--HOR.,At last he found the charmer only feign'd;
3767,--HOR.,And was diverted when he should be pain'd.
3768,--HOR.,What greater vengeance had the gods in store?
3769,--HOR.,"How tedious life, now she can plague no more!"
3770,--HOR.,She tries a thousand arts; but none succeed:
3771,--HOR.,She's forc'd a fever to procure indeed:
3772,--HOR.,"Thus strictly prov'd this virtuous, loving wife,"
3773,--HOR.,Her husband's pain was dearer than her life.
3774,--HOR.,"Anxious Melania rises to my view,"
3775,--HOR.,Who never thinks her lover pays his due:
3776,--HOR.,"Visit, present, treat, flatter, and adore;"
3777,--HOR.,"Her majesty, to-morrow, calls for more."
3778,--HOR.,"His wounded ears complaints eternal fill,"
3779,--HOR.,"As unoil'd hinges, querulously shrill."
3780,--HOR.,"""You went last night with Celia to the ball."""
3781,--HOR.,"You prove it false. ""Not go! that's worst of all."""
3782,--HOR.,"Nothing can please her, nothing not inflame;"
3783,--HOR.,And arrant contradictions are the same.
3784,--HOR.,"Her lover must be sad, to please her spleen;"
3785,--HOR.,His mirth is an inexpiable sin:
3786,--HOR.,"For of all rivals that can pain her breast,"
3787,--HOR.,"There's one, that wounds far deeper than the rest;"
3788,--HOR.,"To wreck her quiet, the most dreadful shelf"
3789,--HOR.,Is if her lover dares enjoy himself.
3790,--HOR.,"And this, because she's exquisitely fair:"
3791,--HOR.,"Should I dispute her beauty, how she'd stare!"
3792,--HOR.,How would Melania be surpris'd to hear
3793,--HOR.,She's quite deform'd! And yet the case is clear;
3794,--HOR.,"What's female beauty, but an air divine,"
3795,--HOR.,Thro' which the mind's all gentle graces shine?
3796,--HOR.,"They, like the sun, irradiate all between;"
3797,--HOR.,The body charms because the soul is seen.
3798,--HOR.,"Hence, men are often captives of a face,"
3799,--HOR.,"They know not why, of no peculiar grace:"
3800,--HOR.,"Some forms, tho' bright, no mortal man can bear;"
3801,--HOR.,"Some, none resist, tho' not exceeding fair."
3802,--HOR.,"Aspasia's highly born, and nicely bred,"
3803,--HOR.,"Of taste refin'd, in life and manners read;"
3804,--HOR.,"Yet reaps no fruit from her superior sense,"
3805,--HOR.,But to be teaz'd by her own excellence.
3806,--HOR.,"""Folks are so awkward! things so unpolite!"""
3807,--HOR.,She's elegantly pain'd from morn till night.
3808,--HOR.,Her delicacy's shock'd where'er she goes;
3809,--HOR.,Each creature's imperfections are her woes.
3810,--HOR.,"Heaven by its favour has the fair distrest,"
3811,--HOR.,And pour'd such blessings--that she can't be blest.
3812,--HOR.,"Ah! why so vain, though blooming in thy spring,"
3813,--HOR.,"Thou shining, frail, ador'd, and wretched thing?"
3814,--HOR.,Old age will come; disease may come before;
3815,--HOR.,Fifteen is full as mortal as threescore.
3816,--HOR.,"Thy fortune, and thy charms, may soon decay:"
3817,--HOR.,"But grant these fugitives prolong their stay,"
3818,--HOR.,"Their basis totters, their foundation shakes;"
3819,--HOR.,"Life, that supports them, in a moment breaks;"
3820,--HOR.,Then wrought into the soul let virtues shine;
3821,--HOR.,"The ground eternal, as the work divine."
3822,--HOR.,Julia's a manager; she's born for rule;
3823,--HOR.,And knows her wiser husband is a fool;
3824,--HOR.,"Assemblies holds, and spins the subtle thread"
3825,--HOR.,That guides the lover to his fair one's bed:
3826,--HOR.,"For difficult amours can smooth the way,"
3827,--HOR.,"And tender letters dictate, or convey."
3828,--HOR.,"But if depriv'd of such important cares,"
3829,--HOR.,Her wisdom condescends to less affairs.
3830,--HOR.,"For her own breakfast she'll project a scheme,"
3831,--HOR.,Nor take her tea without a stratagem;
3832,--HOR.,Presides o'er trifles with a serious face;
3833,--HOR.,Important by the virtue of grimace.
3834,--HOR.,Ladies supreme among amusements reign;
3835,--HOR.,"By nature born to soothe, and entertain."
3836,--HOR.,Their prudence in a share of folly lies:
3837,--HOR.,"Why will they be so weak, as to be wise?"
3838,--HOR.,"Syrena is for ever in extremes,"
3839,--HOR.,"And with a vengeance she commends, or blames."
3840,--HOR.,"Conscious of her discernment, which is good,"
3841,--HOR.,She strains too much to make it understood.
3842,--HOR.,"Her judgment just, her sentence is too strong;"
3843,--HOR.,"Because she's right, she's ever in the wrong."
3844,--HOR.,"Brunetta's wise in actions great, and rare;"
3845,--HOR.,But scorns on trifles to bestow her care.
3846,--HOR.,"Thus ev'ry hour Brunetta is to blame,"
3847,--HOR.,"Because th' occasion is beneath her aim,"
3848,--HOR.,"Think nought a trifle, though it small appear;"
3849,--HOR.,"Small sands the mountain, moments make the year,"
3850,--HOR.,"And trifles life. Your care to trifles give,"
3851,--HOR.,"Or you may die, before you truly live."
3852,--HOR.,"Go breakfast with Alicia, there you'll see,"
3853,--HOR.,"Simplex munditiis, to the last degree:"

3856,--HOR.,"She drawls her words, and waddles in her pace;"
3857,--HOR.,"Unwash'd her hands, and much besnuff'd her face."
3858,--HOR.,"A nail uncut, and head uncomb'd, she loves;"
3859,--HOR.,"And would draw on jack-boots, as soon as gloves."
3860,--HOR.,Gloves by Queen Bess's maidens might be miss'd;
3861,--HOR.,Her blessed eyes ne'er saw a female fist.
3862,--HOR.,"Lovers, beware! to wound how can she fail"
3863,--HOR.,"With scarlet finger, and long jetty nail?"
3864,--HOR.,"For Harvey the first wit she cannot be,"

3866,--HOR.,"Since full each other station of renown,"
3867,--HOR.,Who would not be the greatest trapes in town?

3873,--HOR.,"""Methinks I look so wretchedly to-day!"""
3874,--HOR.,"When most the world applauds you, most beware;"
3875,--HOR.,'Tis often less a blessing than a snare.
3876,--HOR.,Distrust mankind; with your own heart confer;
3877,--HOR.,And dread even there to find a flatterer.
3878,--HOR.,The breath of others raises our renown;
3879,--HOR.,Our own as surely blows the pageant down.
3880,--HOR.,"Take up no more than you by worth can claim,"
3881,--HOR.,Lest soon you prove a bankrupt in your fame.
3882,--HOR.,"But own I must, in this perverted age,"
3883,--HOR.,"Who most deserve, can't always most engage."
3884,--HOR.,"So far is worth from making glory sure,"
3885,--HOR.,It often hinders what it should procure.
3886,--HOR.,"Whom praise we most? The virtuous, brave, and wise?"
3887,--HOR.,"No; wretches, whom, in secret, we despise."
3888,--HOR.,"And who so blind, as not to see the cause?"
3889,--HOR.,No rivals rais'd by such discreet applause;
3890,--HOR.,"And yet, of credit it lays in a store,"
3891,--HOR.,By which our spleen may wound true worth the more.
3892,--HOR.,Ladies there are who think one crime is all:
3893,--HOR.,"Can women, then, no way but backward fall?"
3894,--HOR.,"So sweet is that one crime they don't pursue,"
3895,--HOR.,"To pay its loss, they think all others few."
3896,--HOR.,"Who hold that crime so dear, must never claim"
3897,--HOR.,Of injur'd modesty the sacred name.
3898,--HOR.,"But Clio thus: ""What! railing without end?"
3899,--HOR.,"Mean task! how much more gen'rous to commend!"""
3900,--HOR.,"Yes, to commend as you are wont to do,"
3901,--HOR.,"My kind instructor, and example too."
3902,--HOR.,"""Daphnis,"" says Clio, ""has a charming eye:"
3903,--HOR.,What pity 'tis her shoulder is awry!
3904,--HOR.,Aspasia's shape indeed--but then her air--
3905,--HOR.,The man has parts who finds destruction there.
3906,--HOR.,Almeria's wit has something that's divine;
3907,--HOR.,And wit's enough--how few in all things shine!
3908,--HOR.,"Selina serves her friends, relieves the poor--"
3909,--HOR.,Who was it said Selina's near threescore?
3910,--HOR.,At Lucia's match I from my soul rejoice;
3911,--HOR.,The world congratulates so wise a choice;
3912,--HOR.,His lordship's rent-roll is exceeding great--
3913,--HOR.,But mortgages will sap the best estate.
3914,--HOR.,In Sherley's form might cherubims appear;
3915,--HOR.,"But then--she has a freckle on her ear."""
3916,--HOR.,"Without a but, Hortensia she commends,"
3917,--HOR.,"The first of women, and the best of friends;"
3918,--HOR.,"Owns her in person, wit, fame, virtue, bright:"
3919,--HOR.,But how comes this to pass?--She died last night.
3920,--HOR.,"Thus nymphs commend, who yet at satire rail:"
3921,--HOR.,"Indeed that's needless, if such praise prevail."
3922,--HOR.,And whence such praise? Our virulence is thrown
3923,--HOR.,"On others' fame, thro' fondness for our own."
3924,--HOR.,"Of rank and riches proud, Cleora frowns;"
3925,--HOR.,For are not coronets akin to crowns?
3926,--HOR.,"Her greedy eye, and her sublime address,"
3927,--HOR.,The height of avarice and pride confess.
3928,--HOR.,You seek perfections worthy of her rank;
3929,--HOR.,"Go, seek for her perfections at the bank."
3930,--HOR.,"By wealth unquench'd, by reason uncontrol'd,"
3931,--HOR.,For ever burns her sacred thirst of gold.
3932,--HOR.,"As fond of five-pence, as the veriest cit;"
3933,--HOR.,And quite as much detested as a wit.
3934,--HOR.,"Can gold calm passion, or make reason shine?"
3935,--HOR.,"Can we dig peace, or wisdom, from the mine?"
3936,--HOR.,Wisdom to gold prefer; for 'tis much less
3937,--HOR.,"To make our fortune, than our happiness."
3938,--HOR.,"That happiness which great ones often see,"
3939,--HOR.,"With rage and wonder, in a low degree;"
3940,--HOR.,Themselves unblest. The poor are only poor;

3950,--HOR.,See how they beg an alms of flattery!
3951,--HOR.,They languish! oh support them with a lie!
3952,--HOR.,A decent competence we fully taste;
3953,--HOR.,"It strikes our sense, and gives a constant feast:"
3954,--HOR.,"More, we perceive by dint of thought alone;"
3955,--HOR.,"The rich must labor to possess their own,"
3956,--HOR.,To feel their great abundance; and request
3957,--HOR.,Their humble friends to help them to be blest;
3958,--HOR.,"To see their treasures, hear their glory told,"
3959,--HOR.,And aid the wretched impotence of gold.
3960,--HOR.,"But some, great souls! and touch'd with warmth divine,"
3961,--HOR.,"Give gold a price, and teach its beams to shine."
3962,--HOR.,All hoarded treasures they repute a load;
3963,--HOR.,"Nor think their wealth their own, till well bestow'd."
3964,--HOR.,"Grand reservoirs of public happiness,"
3965,--HOR.,Through secret streams diffusively they bless;
3966,--HOR.,"And, while their bounties glide conceal'd from view,"
3967,--HOR.,"Relieve our wants, and spare our blushes too."
3968,--HOR.,But satire is my task; and these destroy
3969,--HOR.,"Her gloomy province, and malignant joy."
3970,--HOR.,"Help me, ye misers! help me to complain,"

3972,--HOR.,But our invectives must despair success;
3973,--HOR.,"For next to praise, she values nothing less."
3974,--HOR.,"What picture's yonder, loosen'd from its frame?"
3975,--HOR.,Or is't Asturia? that affected dame.
3976,--HOR.,"The brightest forms, through affectation, fade"
3977,--HOR.,"To strange new things, which nature never made."
3978,--HOR.,"Frown not, ye fair! so much your sex we prize,"
3979,--HOR.,We hate those arts that take you from our eyes.

3994,--HOR.,An hecatomb of characters supplies
3995,--HOR.,Thy painted altars' daily sacrifice.
3996,--HOR.,"H----, P----, B----, aspers'd by thee, decay,"
3997,--HOR.,"As grains of finest sugars melt away,"
3998,--HOR.,And recommend thee more to mortal taste:
3999,--HOR.,Scandal's the sweet'ner of a female feast.
4000,--HOR.,"But this inhuman triumph shall decline,"
4001,--HOR.,And thy revolting naiads call for wine;
4002,--HOR.,Spirits no longer shall serve under thee;
4003,--HOR.,"But reign in thy own cup, exploded tea!"
4004,--HOR.,"Citronia's nose declares thy ruin nigh,"
4005,--HOR.,And who dares give Citronia's nose the lie?(16)
4006,--HOR.,"The ladies long at men of drink exclaim'd,"
4007,--HOR.,"And what impair'd both health and virtue, blam'd;"
4008,--HOR.,"At length, to rescue man, the generous lass"
4009,--HOR.,Stole from her consort the pernicious glass;
4010,--HOR.,"As glorious as the British queen renown'd,"
4011,--HOR.,Who suck'd the poison from her husband's wound.
4012,--HOR.,"Nor to the glass alone are nymphs inclin'd,"
4013,--HOR.,But every bolder vice of bold mankind.
4014,--HOR.,O Juvenal! for thy severer rage!
4015,--HOR.,To lash the ranker follies of our age.
4016,--HOR.,"Are there, among the females of our isle,"
4017,--HOR.,"Such faults, at which it is a fault to smile?"
4018,--HOR.,"There are. Vice, once by modest nature chain'd"
4019,--HOR.,"And legal ties, expatiates unrestrain'd;"
4020,--HOR.,"Without thin decency held up to view,"
4021,--HOR.,Naked she stalks o'er law and gospel too.
4022,--HOR.,"Our matrons lead such exemplary lives,"
4023,--HOR.,"Men sigh in vain for none, but for their wives;"
4024,--HOR.,"Who marry to be free, to range the more,"
4025,--HOR.,And wed one man to wanton with a score.
4026,--HOR.,"Abroad too kind, at home 'tis steadfast hate,"
4027,--HOR.,And one eternal tempest of debate.
4028,--HOR.,"What foul eruptions, from a look most meek!"
4029,--HOR.,"What thunders bursting, from a dimpled cheek!"
4030,--HOR.,Their passions bear it with a lofty hand!
4031,--HOR.,"But then, their reason is at due command."
4032,--HOR.,"Is there whom you detest, and seek his life?"
4033,--HOR.,Trust no soul with the secret--but his wife.
4034,--HOR.,"Wives wonder that their conduct I condemn,"
4035,--HOR.,"And ask, what kindred is a spouse to them?"
4036,--HOR.,What swarms of am'rous grandmothers I see!
4037,--HOR.,"And misses, ancient in iniquity?"
4038,--HOR.,"What blasting whispers, and what loud declaiming!"
4039,--HOR.,"What lying, drinking, bawding, swearing, gaming!"

4053,--HOR.,"Till now, she-atheists ne'er appear'd on earth."
4054,--HOR.,"Ye men of deep researches, say, whence springs"
4055,--HOR.,"This daring character, in timorous things?"
4056,--HOR.,"Who start at feathers, from an insect fly,"
4057,--HOR.,A match for nothing--but the Deity.
4058,--HOR.,"But, not to wrong the fair, the muse must own"

4061,--HOR.,"""From thinking free, to be free agents too."""
4062,--HOR.,"They strive with their own hearts, and keep them down,"
4063,--HOR.,In complaisance to all the fools in town.
4064,--HOR.,O how they tremble at the name of prude!
4065,--HOR.,And die with shame at thought of being good!

4122,--HOR.,"Immortal were we, or else mortal quite,"
4123,--HOR.,I less should blame this criminal delight:
4124,--HOR.,But since the gay assembly's gayest room
4125,--HOR.,"Is but the upper story of some tomb,"

4127,--HOR.,"And, thought to fly, contend to be undone."
4128,--HOR.,"We need not buy our ruin with our crime,"
4129,--HOR.,And give eternity to murder time.
4130,--HOR.,The love of gaming is the worst of ills;

4148,--HOR.,See her eyes start! cheeks glow! and muscles swell!
4149,--HOR.,Like the mad maid in the Cumean cell.
4150,--HOR.,Thus that divine one her soft nights employs!
4151,--HOR.,Thus tunes her soul to tender nuptial joys!

4168,--HOR.,Why that gay son to distant regions sent?
4169,--HOR.,What fiends that daughter's destin'd match prevent?
4170,--HOR.,Why the whole house in sudden ruin laid?
4171,--HOR.,"O nothing, but last night--my lady play'd."
4172,--HOR.,But wanders not my satire from my theme?
4173,--HOR.,Is this too owing to the love of fame?
4174,--HOR.,"Though now your hearts on lucre are bestow'd,"
4175,--HOR.,'Twas first a vain devotion to the mode;
4176,--HOR.,"Nor cease we here, since 'tis a vice so strong,"
4177,--HOR.,The torrent sweeps all womankind along;
4178,--HOR.,"This may be said, in honour of our times,"

4250,VIRG.,"That glory, which on thee reflects a light."
4251,VIRG.,"Illustrious commerce, and but rarely known!"
4252,VIRG.,"To give, and take, a lustre from the throne."
4253,VIRG.,Nor think that thou art foreign to my theme;
4254,VIRG.,The fountain is not foreign to the stream.
4255,VIRG.,"How all mankind will be surprised, to see"
4256,VIRG.,This flood of British folly charg'd on thee!
4257,VIRG.,"Say, Britain! whence this caprice of thy sons,"
4258,VIRG.,Which thro' their various ranks with fury runs?
4259,VIRG.,"The cause is plain, a cause which we must bless;"
4260,VIRG.,"For caprice is the daughter of success,"
4261,VIRG.,"(A bad effect, but from a pleasing cause!)"

4267,VIRG.,"Her public wounds bound up, her credit high,"
4268,VIRG.,"Her commerce spreading sails in every sky,"
4269,VIRG.,"The pleasing scene recalls my theme again,"
4270,VIRG.,"And shows the madness of ambitious men,"
4271,VIRG.,"Who, fond of bloodshed, draw the murd'ring sword,"
4272,VIRG.,And burn to give mankind a single lord.
4273,VIRG.,The follies past are of a private kind;

4318,VIRG.,"Who coin the face, and petrify the heart;"
4319,VIRG.,"All real kindness for the show discard,"
4320,VIRG.,"As marble polish'd, and as marble hard;"
4321,VIRG.,"Who do for gold what Christians do thro' grace,"

4334,VIRG.,May furnish laughter for another year.
4335,VIRG.,"Then let Crispino, who was ne'er refused"
4336,VIRG.,"The justice yet of being well abus'd,"
4337,VIRG.,With patience wait; and be content to reign
4338,VIRG.,The pink of puppies in some future strain.
4339,VIRG.,"Some future strain, in which the muse shall tell"
4340,VIRG.,"How science dwindles, and how volumes swell."
4341,VIRG.,"How commentators each dark passage shun,"
4342,VIRG.,And hold their farthing candle to the sun.
4343,VIRG.,"How tortur'd texts to speak our sense are made,"
4344,VIRG.,And every vice is to the scripture laid.
4345,VIRG.,How misers squeeze a young voluptuous peer;
4346,VIRG.,His sins to Lucifer not half so dear.
4347,VIRG.,How Verres is less qualified to steal
4348,VIRG.,"With sword and pistol, than with wax and seal."
4349,VIRG.,"How lawyers' fees to such excess are run,"
4350,VIRG.,That clients are redress'd till they're undone.
4351,VIRG.,How one man's anguish is another's sport;
4352,VIRG.,And ev'n denials cost us dear at court.
4353,VIRG.,"How man eternally false judgments makes,"
4354,VIRG.,And all his joys and sorrows are mistakes.
4355,VIRG.,"This swarm of themes that settles on my pen,"
4356,VIRG.,"Which I, like summer flies, shake off again,"
4357,VIRG.,Let others sing; to whom my weak essay
4358,VIRG.,"But sounds a prelude, and points out their prey:"
4359,VIRG.,"That duty done, I hasten to complete"
4360,VIRG.,My own design; for Tonson's at the gate.
4361,VIRG.,"The love of fame in its effect survey'd,"
4362,VIRG.,The muse has sung; be now the cause display'd:
4363,VIRG.,"Since so diffusive, and so wide its sway,"
4364,VIRG.,"What is this power, whom all mankind obey?"
4365,VIRG.,"Shot from above, by heaven's indulgence, came"
4366,VIRG.,"This generous ardour, this unconquer'd flame,"
4367,VIRG.,"To warm, to raise, to deify, mankind,"
4368,VIRG.,Still burning brightest in the noblest mind.
4369,VIRG.,"By large-soul'd men, for thirst of fame renown'd,"
4370,VIRG.,"Wise laws were fram'd, and sacred arts were found;"
4371,VIRG.,"Desire of praise first broke the patriot's rest,"
4372,VIRG.,And made a bulwark of the warrior's breast;
4373,VIRG.,It bids Argyll in fields and senate shine.
4374,VIRG.,What more can prove its origin divine?
4375,VIRG.,"But, oh! this passion planted in the soul,"
4376,VIRG.,"On eagle's wings to mount her to the pole,"
4377,VIRG.,"The flaming minister of virtue meant,"
4378,VIRG.,"Set up false gods, and wrong'd her high descent."
4379,VIRG.,"Ambition, hence, exerts a doubtful force,"
4380,VIRG.,"Of blots, and beauties, an alternate source;"
4381,VIRG.,"Hence Gildon rails, that raven of the pit,"
4382,VIRG.,Who thrives upon the carcasses of wit;
4383,VIRG.,And in art-loving Scarborough is seen
4384,VIRG.,How kind a pattern Pollio might have been.
4385,VIRG.,"Pursuit of fame with pedants fills our schools,"
4386,VIRG.,And into coxcombs burnishes our fools;
4387,VIRG.,"Pursuit of fame makes solid learning bright,"
4388,VIRG.,And Newton lifts above a mortal height;
4389,VIRG.,"That key of nature, by whose wit she clears"
4390,VIRG.,"Her long, long secrets of five thousand years."
4391,VIRG.,"Would you then fully comprehend the whole,"
4392,VIRG.,"Why, and in what degrees, pride sways the soul?"
4393,VIRG.,"(For though in all, not equally, she reigns,)"
4394,VIRG.,"Awake to knowledge, and attend my strains."
4395,VIRG.,"Ye doctors! hear the doctrine I disclose,"
4396,VIRG.,"As true, as if't were writ in dullest prose;"
4397,VIRG.,"As if a letter'd dunce had said, ""'Tis right,"""
4398,VIRG.,And imprimatur usher'd it to light.
4399,VIRG.,"Ambition, in the truly noble mind,"
4400,VIRG.,With sister virtue is for ever join'd;
4401,VIRG.,"As in fam'd Lucrece, who, with equal dread,"
4402,VIRG.,"From guilt, and shame, by her last conduct, fled:"
4403,VIRG.,"Her virtue long rebell'd in firm disdain,"
4404,VIRG.,And the sword pointed at her heart in vain;
4405,VIRG.,"But, when the slave was threaten'd to be laid"
4406,VIRG.,"Dead by her side, her love of fame obey'd."
4407,VIRG.,In meaner minds ambition works alone;
4408,VIRG.,"But with such art puts virtue's aspect on,"
4409,VIRG.,"That not more like in feature and in mien,"
4410,VIRG.,(19)The god and mortal in the comic scene.
4411,VIRG.,"False Julius, ambush'd in this fair disguise,"
4412,VIRG.,Soon made the Roman liberties his prize.
4413,VIRG.,"No mask in basest minds ambition wears,"
4414,VIRG.,But in full light pricks up her ass's ears:
4415,VIRG.,"All I have sung are instances of this,"
4416,VIRG.,And prove my theme unfolded not amiss.
4417,VIRG.,Ye vain! desist from your erroneous strife;
4418,VIRG.,"Be wise, and quit the false sublime of life,"
4419,VIRG.,"The true ambition there alone resides,"
4420,VIRG.,"Where justice vindicates, and wisdom guides;"
4421,VIRG.,Where inward dignity joins outward state;
4422,VIRG.,"Our purpose good, as our achievement great;"
4423,VIRG.,Where public blessings public praise attend;
4424,VIRG.,"Where glory is our motive, not our end."
4425,VIRG.,Wouldst thou be fam'd? Have those high deeds in view
4426,VIRG.,"Brave men would act, though scandal should ensue."
4427,VIRG.,Behold a prince! whom no swoln thoughts inflame;
4428,VIRG.,"No pride of thrones, no fever after fame!"
4429,VIRG.,"But when the welfare of mankind inspires,"
4430,VIRG.,"And death in view to dear-bought glory fires,"
4431,VIRG.,"Proud conquests then, then regal pomps delight;"
4432,VIRG.,"Then crowns, then triumphs, sparkle in his sight;"
4433,VIRG.,"Tumult and noise are dear, which with them bring"
4434,VIRG.,His people's blessings to their ardent king:
4435,VIRG.,"But, when those great heroic motives cease,"
4436,VIRG.,His swelling soul subsides to native peace;
4437,VIRG.,"From tedious grandeur's faded charms withdraws,"
4438,VIRG.,A sudden foe to splendour and applause;
4439,VIRG.,"Greatly deferring his arrears of fame,"
4440,VIRG.,Till men and angels jointly shout his name.
4441,VIRG.,O pride celestial! which can pride disdain;
4442,VIRG.,O blest ambition! which can ne'er be vain.
4443,VIRG.,"From one fam'd Alpine hill, which props the sky,"
4444,VIRG.,"In whose deep womb unfathom'd waters lie,"
4445,VIRG.,"Here burst the Rhone, and sounding Po; there shine,"
4446,VIRG.,"In infant rills, the Danube and the Rhine;"
4447,VIRG.,"From the rich store one fruitful urn supplies,"
4448,VIRG.,"Whole kingdoms smile, a thousand harvests rise."
4449,VIRG.,"In Brunswick such a source the muse adores,"
4450,VIRG.,Which public blessings thro' half Europe pours.
4451,VIRG.,"When his heart burns with such a godlike aim,"
4452,VIRG.,Angels and George are rivals for the fame;
4453,VIRG.,"George! who in foes can soft affections raise,"
4454,VIRG.,And charm envenom'd satire into praise.
4455,VIRG.,"(20)Nor human rage alone his power perceives,"
4456,VIRG.,"But the mad winds, and the tumultuous waves."
4457,VIRG.,"Ev'n storms (death's fiercest ministers!) forbear,"
4458,VIRG.,"And, in their own wild empire, learn to spare."
4459,VIRG.,"Thus, nature's self, supporting man's decree,"
4460,VIRG.,"Styles Britain's sovereign, sovereign of the sea."
4461,VIRG.,"While sea and air, great Brunswick! shook our state,"
4462,VIRG.,"And sported with a king's and kingdom's fate,"
4463,VIRG.,"Depriv'd of what she lov'd, and press'd by fear"
4464,VIRG.,"Of ever losing what she held most dear,"
4465,VIRG.,"How did Britannia, like (21)Achilles, weep,"
4466,VIRG.,And tell her sorrows to the kindred deep!
4467,VIRG.,"Hang o'er the floods, and, in devotion warm,"
4468,VIRG.,"Strive, for thee, with the surge, and fight the storm"
4469,VIRG.,"What felt thy Walpole, pilot of the realm!"
4470,VIRG.,Our Palinurus(22) slept not at the helm;
4471,VIRG.,"His eye ne'er clos'd; long since inur'd to wake,"
4472,VIRG.,And out-watch every star for Brunswick's sake:
4473,VIRG.,"By thwarting passions tost, by cares opprest,"
4474,VIRG.,He found the tempest pictur'd in his breast:
4475,VIRG.,"But, now, what joys that gloom of heart dispel,"
4476,VIRG.,"No powers of language--but his own, can tell:"
4477,VIRG.,"His own, which nature and the graces form,"
4478,VIRG.,"At will, to raise, or hush, the civil storm."

4493,OCEAN: AN ODE,I think myself obliged to recommend to you a consideration of the
4494,OCEAN: AN ODE,greatest importance; and I should look upon it as a great
4495,OCEAN: AN ODE,"happiness, if, at the beginning of my reign, I could see the"
4496,OCEAN: AN ODE,"foundation laid of so great and necessary a work, as the increase"
4497,OCEAN: AN ODE,and encouragement of our seamen in general; that they may be
4498,OCEAN: AN ODE,"invited, rather than compelled by force and violence, to enter"
4499,OCEAN: AN ODE,"into the service of their country, as oft as occasion shall"
4500,OCEAN: AN ODE,require it: a consideration worthy the representatives of a people
4501,OCEAN: AN ODE,great and flourishing in trade and navigation. This leads me to
4502,OCEAN: AN ODE,"mention to you the case of Greenwich Hospital, that care may be"
4503,OCEAN: AN ODE,"taken, by some addition to that fund, to render comfortable and"
4504,OCEAN: AN ODE,"effectual that charitable provision, for the support and"
4505,OCEAN: AN ODE,"maintenance of our seamen, worn out, and become decrepit by age"

4520,OCEAN: AN ODE,"I dare complete,"
4521,OCEAN: AN ODE,"And join with ocean, ocean's king."
4522,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4523,OCEAN: AN ODE,The Roman ode

4530,OCEAN: AN ODE,"Let Thebes, nor Rome,"

4543,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4544,OCEAN: AN ODE,"No former race,"

4546,OCEAN: AN ODE,This theme to ravish durst aspire;
4547,OCEAN: AN ODE,With virgin charms

4550,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4551,OCEAN: AN ODE,My lays I file

4557,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4558,OCEAN: AN ODE,How music charms!
4559,OCEAN: AN ODE,How metre warms!
4560,OCEAN: AN ODE,"Parent of actions, good and brave!"
4561,OCEAN: AN ODE,How vice it tames!
4562,OCEAN: AN ODE,And worth inflames!
4563,OCEAN: AN ODE,And holds proud empire o'er the grave!
4564,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4565,OCEAN: AN ODE,Jove mark'd for man
4566,OCEAN: AN ODE,"A scanty span,"
4567,OCEAN: AN ODE,But lent him wings to fly his doom;
4568,OCEAN: AN ODE,Wit scorns the grave;

4645,OCEAN: AN ODE,On Lyric Poetry.
4646,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4647,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4648,OCEAN: AN ODE,"How imperfect soever my own composition may be, yet am I willing to speak"
4649,OCEAN: AN ODE,"a word or two, of the nature of lyric poetry; to show that I have, at"
4650,OCEAN: AN ODE,"least, some idea of perfection in that kind of poem in which I am engaged;"
4651,OCEAN: AN ODE,and that I do not think myself poet enough entirely to rely on inspiration
4652,OCEAN: AN ODE,for success in it.
4653,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4654,OCEAN: AN ODE,"To our having, or not having, this idea of perfection in the poem we"
4655,OCEAN: AN ODE,"undertake, is chiefly owing the merit or demerit of our performances, as"
4656,OCEAN: AN ODE,also the modesty or vanity of our opinions concerning them. And in
4657,OCEAN: AN ODE,"speaking of it I shall show how it unavoidably comes to pass, that bad"
4658,OCEAN: AN ODE,"poets, that is, poets in general, are esteemed, and really are, the most"
4659,OCEAN: AN ODE,"vain, the most irritable, and most ridiculous set of men upon earth. But"
4660,OCEAN: AN ODE,poetry in its own nature is certainly
4661,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4662,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4663,OCEAN: AN ODE,Non hos quæsitum munus in usus.
4664,OCEAN: AN ODE,
4665,--VIRG.,--VIRG.
4666,--VIRG.,
4667,--VIRG.,
4668,--VIRG.,He that has an idea of perfection in the work he undertakes may fail in
4669,--VIRG.,"it; he that has not, must: and yet he will be vain. For every little"
4670,--VIRG.,"degree of beauty, how short or improper soever, will be looked on fondly"
4671,--VIRG.,"by him; because it is all pure gains, and more than he promised to"
4672,--VIRG.,"himself; and because he has no test, or standard in his judgment, with"
4673,--VIRG.,which to chastise his opinion of it.
4674,--VIRG.,
4675,--VIRG.,"Now this idea of perfection is, in poetry, more refined than in other"
4676,--VIRG.,"kinds of writing; and because more refined, therefore more difficult; and"
4677,--VIRG.,"because more difficult, therefore more rarely attained; and the"
4678,--VIRG.,"non-attainment of it is, as I have said, the source of our vanity. Hence"
4679,--VIRG.,the poetic clan are more obnoxious to vanity than others. And from vanity
4680,--VIRG.,"consequently flows that great sensibility of disrespect, that quick"
4681,--VIRG.,"resentment, that tinder of the mind that kindles at every spark, and"
4682,--VIRG.,justly marks them out for the genus irritabile among mankind. And from
4683,--VIRG.,"this combustible temper, this serious anger for no very serious things,"
4684,--VIRG.,"things looked on by most as foreign to the important points of life, as"
4685,--VIRG.,"consequentially flows that inheritance of ridicule, which devolves on"
4686,--VIRG.,"them, from generation to generation. As soon as they become authors, they"
4687,--VIRG.,"become like Ben Jonson's angry boy, and learn the art of quarrel."
4688,--VIRG.,
4689,--VIRG.,
4690,--VIRG.,Concordes animæ--dum nocte prementur;
4691,--VIRG.,"Heu! quantum inter se bellum, si lumina vitæ"
4692,--VIRG.,"Attigerint, quantas acies stragemque ciebunt!"
4693,--VIRG.,"Qui Juvenes! quantas ostentant, aspice, vires."
4694,--VIRG.,"Ne, pueri! ne tanta animis assuescite bella."
4695,--VIRG.,"Tuque prior, tu parce, genus qui ducis Olympo,"
4696,--VIRG.,"Sidereo flagrans clypeo, et coelestibus armis,"
4697,--VIRG.,"Projice tela manu, sanguis meus!"
4698,--VIRG.,"Nec te ullæ facies, non terruit ipse Typhoeus"
4699,--VIRG.,"Arduus, arma tenens; non te Messapus et Ufens,"
4700,--VIRG.,Contemtorque Deûm Mezentius.
4701,--VIRG.,
4702,VIRG.,VIRG.
4703,VIRG.,
4704,VIRG.,
4705,VIRG.,But to return. He that has this idea of perfection in the work he
4706,VIRG.,"undertakes, however successful he is, will yet be modest; because to rise"
4707,VIRG.,"up to that idea, which he proposed for his model, is almost, if not"
4708,VIRG.,"absolutely, impossible."
4709,VIRG.,
4710,VIRG.,"These two observations account for what may seem as strange, as it is"
4711,VIRG.,"infallibly true; I mean, they show us why good writers have the lowest,"
4712,VIRG.,"and bad writers the highest, opinion of their own performances. They who"
4713,VIRG.,"have only a partial idea of this perfection, as their portion of ignorance"
4714,VIRG.,"or knowledge of it is greater or less, have proportionable degrees of"
4715,VIRG.,modesty or conceit.
4716,VIRG.,
4717,VIRG.,"Nor, though natural good understanding makes a tolerably just judgment in"
4718,VIRG.,"things of this nature, will the reader judge the worse, for forming to"
4719,VIRG.,"himself a notion of what he ought to expect from the piece he has in hand,"
4720,VIRG.,before he begins his perusal of it.
4721,VIRG.,
4722,VIRG.,"The ode, as it is the eldest kind of poetry, so it is more spiritous, and"
4723,VIRG.,"more remote from prose, than any other, in sense, sound, expression, and"
4724,VIRG.,"conduct. Its thoughts should be uncommon, sublime, and moral; its numbers"
4725,VIRG.,"full, easy, and most harmonious; its expression pure, strong, delicate,"
4726,VIRG.,yet unaffected; and of a curious felicity beyond other poems; its conduct
4727,VIRG.,"should be rapturous, somewhat abrupt, and immethodical to a vulgar eye."
4728,VIRG.,"That apparent order, and connexion, which gives form and life to some"
4729,VIRG.,"compositions, takes away the very soul of this. Fire, elevation, and"
4730,VIRG.,"select thought, are indispensable; an humble, tame, and vulgar ode is the"
4731,VIRG.,most pitiful error a pen can commit.
4732,VIRG.,
4733,VIRG.,
4734,VIRG.,"Musa dedit fidibus divos, puerosque deorum."
4735,VIRG.,
4736,VIRG.,
4737,VIRG.,"And as its subjects are sublime, its writer's genius should be so too;"
4738,VIRG.,"otherwise it becomes the meanest thing in writing, viz. an involuntary"
4739,VIRG.,burlesque.
4740,VIRG.,
4741,VIRG.,"It is the genuine character, and true merit of the ode, a little to"
4742,VIRG.,startle some apprehensions. Men of cold complexions are very apt to
4743,VIRG.,"mistake a want of vigour in their imaginations, for a delicacy of taste in"
4744,VIRG.,"their judgments; and, like persons of a tender sight, they look on bright"
4745,VIRG.,"objects, in their natural lustre, as too glaring; what is most delightful"
4746,VIRG.,"to a stronger eye, is painful to them. Thus Pindar, who has as much logic"
4747,VIRG.,"at the bottom as Aristotle or Euclid, to some critics has appeared as mad;"
4748,VIRG.,and must appear so to all who enjoy no portion of his own divine spirit.
4749,VIRG.,"Dwarf understandings, measuring others by their own standard, are apt to"
4750,VIRG.,"think they see a monster, when they see a man."
4751,VIRG.,
4752,VIRG.,And indeed it seems to be the amends which nature makes to those whom she
4753,VIRG.,"has not blessed with an elevation of mind, to indulge them in the"
4754,VIRG.,"comfortable mistake, that all is wrong, which falls not within the narrow"
4755,VIRG.,limits of their own comprehensions and relish.
4756,VIRG.,
4757,VIRG.,"Judgment, indeed, that masculine power of the mind, in ode, as in all"
4758,VIRG.,"compositions, should bear the supreme sway; and a beautiful imagination,"
4759,VIRG.,"as its mistress, should be subdued to its dominion. Hence, and hence only,"
4760,VIRG.,can proceed the fairest offspring of the human mind.
4761,VIRG.,
4762,VIRG.,"But then in ode, there is this difference from other kinds of poetry;"
4763,VIRG.,"that, there, the imagination, like a very beautiful mistress, is indulged"
4764,VIRG.,"in the appearance of domineering; though the judgment, like an artful"
4765,VIRG.,"lover, in reality carries its point; and the less it is suspected of it,"
4766,VIRG.,"it shows the more masterly conduct, and deserves the greater commendation."
4767,VIRG.,
4768,VIRG.,"It holds true in this province of writing, as in war, ""The more danger;"
4769,VIRG.,"the more honour."" It must be very enterprising: it must, in Shakespeare's"
4770,VIRG.,"style, have hairbreadth 'scapes; and often tread the very brink of error:"
4771,VIRG.,"nor can it ever deserve the applause of the real judge, unless it renders"
4772,VIRG.,itself obnoxious to the misapprehensions of the contrary.
4773,VIRG.,
4774,VIRG.,"Such is Casimire's strain among the moderns, whose lively wit, and happy"
4775,VIRG.,"fire, is an honour to them. And Buchanan might justly be much admired, if"
4776,VIRG.,"any thing more than the sweetness of his numbers, and the purity of his"
4777,VIRG.,"diction, were his own: his original, from which I have taken my motto,"
4778,VIRG.,"through all the disadvantages of a northern prose translation, is still"
4779,VIRG.,"admirable; and, Cowley says, as preferable in beauty to Buchanan, as Judæa"
4780,VIRG.,is to Scotland.
4781,VIRG.,
4782,VIRG.,"Pindar, Anacreon, Sappho, and Horace, are the great masters of lyric"
4783,VIRG.,"poetry among Heathen writers. Pindar's muse, like Sacharissa, is a"
4784,VIRG.,"stately, imperious, and accomplished beauty; equally disdaining the use of"
4785,VIRG.,"art, and the fear of any rival; so intoxicating that it was the highest"
4786,VIRG.,"commendation that could be given an ancient, that he was not afraid to"
4787,VIRG.,taste of her charms;
4788,VIRG.,
4789,VIRG.,
4790,VIRG.,Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus;
4791,VIRG.,
4792,VIRG.,
4793,VIRG.,a danger which Horace declares he durst not run.
4794,VIRG.,
4795,VIRG.,"Anacreon's Muse is like Amoret, most sweet, natural, and delicate; all"
4796,VIRG.,"over flowers, graces, and charms; inspiring complacency, not awe; and she"
4797,VIRG.,"seems to have good nature enough to admit a rival, which she cannot find."
4798,VIRG.,
4799,VIRG.,"Sappho's Muse, like Lady ----, is passionately tender, and glowing; like oil"
4800,VIRG.,"set on fire, she is soft, and warm, in excess. Sappho has left us a few"
4801,VIRG.,fragments only; time has swallowed the rest; but that little which
4802,VIRG.,"remains, like the remaining jewel of Cleopatra, after the other was"
4803,VIRG.,"dissolved at her banquet, may be esteemed (as was that jewel) a sufficient"
4804,VIRG.,ornament for the goddess of beauty herself.
4805,VIRG.,
4806,VIRG.,"Horace's Muse (like one I shall not presume to name) is correct, solid,"
4807,VIRG.,"and moral; she joins all the sweetness and majesty, all the sense and the"
4808,VIRG.,"fire of the former, in the justest proportions and degrees; superadding a"
4809,VIRG.,felicity of dress entirely her own. She moreover is distinguishable by
4810,VIRG.,"this particularity, that she abounds in hidden graces, and secret charms,"
4811,VIRG.,which none but the discerning can discover; nor are any capable of doing
4812,VIRG.,"full justice, in their opinion to her excellencies, without giving the"
4813,VIRG.,"world, at the same time, an incontestable proof of refinement in their own"
4814,VIRG.,understandings.
4815,VIRG.,
4816,VIRG.,"But, after all, to the honour of our own country I must add, that I think"
4817,VIRG.,Mr. Dryden's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day inferior to no composition of this
4818,VIRG.,kind. Its chief beauty consists in adapting the numbers most happily to
4819,VIRG.,the variety of the occasion. Those by which he has chosen to express
4820,VIRG.,"majesty, (viz.)"
4821,VIRG.,
4822,VIRG.,
4823,VIRG.,"Assumes the God,"
4824,VIRG.,"Affects to nod,"
4825,VIRG.,"And seems to shake the spheres,"
4826,VIRG.,
4827,VIRG.,
4828,VIRG.,"are chosen in the following ode, because the subject of it is great."
4829,VIRG.,
4830,VIRG.,"For the more harmony likewise, I chose the frequent return of rhyme; which"
4831,VIRG.,laid me under great difficulties. But difficulties overcome give grace and
4832,VIRG.,pleasure. Nor can I account for the pleasure of rhyme in general (of which
4833,VIRG.,the moderns are too fond) but from this truth.
4834,VIRG.,
4835,VIRG.,But then the writer must take care that the difficulty is overcome. That
4836,VIRG.,"is, he must make rhyme consistent with as perfect sense, and expression,"
4837,VIRG.,"as could be expected if he was free from that shackle. Otherwise, it gives"
4838,VIRG.,"neither grace to the work, nor pleasure to the reader, nor, consequently,"
4839,VIRG.,reputation to the poet.
4840,VIRG.,
4841,VIRG.,"To sum the whole: ode should be peculiar, but not strained; moral, but not"
4842,VIRG.,"flat; natural, but not obvious; delicate, but not affected; noble, but not"
4843,VIRG.,"ambitious; full, but not obscure; fiery, but not mad; thick, but not"
4844,VIRG.,"loaded in its numbers, which should be most harmonious, without the least"
4845,VIRG.,"sacrifice of expression, or of sense. Above all, in this, as in every work"
4846,VIRG.,"of genius, somewhat of an original spirit should be, at least attempted;"
4847,VIRG.,"otherwise the poet, whose character disclaims mediocrity, makes a"
4848,VIRG.,secondary praise his ultimate ambition; which has something of a
4849,VIRG.,"contradiction in it. Originals only have true life, and differ as much"
4850,VIRG.,"from the best imitations, as men from the most animated pictures of them."
4851,VIRG.,Nor is what I say at all inconsistent with a due deference for the great
4852,VIRG.,"standards of antiquity; nay, that very deference is an argument for it,"
4853,VIRG.,for doubtless their example is on my side in this matter. And we should
4854,VIRG.,"rather imitate their example in the general motives, and fundamental"
4855,VIRG.,"methods of their working, than in their works themselves. This is a"
4856,VIRG.,"distinction, I think, not hitherto made, and a distinction of consequence."
4857,VIRG.,For the first may make us their equals; the second must pronounce us their
4858,VIRG.,inferiors even in our utmost success. But the first of these prizes is not
4859,VIRG.,so readily taken by the moderns; as valuables too massy for easy carriage
4860,VIRG.,are not so liable to the thief.
4861,VIRG.,
4862,VIRG.,The ancients had a particular regard to the choice of their subjects;
4863,VIRG.,"which were generally national and great. My subject is, in its own nature,"
4864,VIRG.,noble; most proper for an Englishman; never more proper than on this
4865,VIRG.,occasion; and (what is strange) hitherto unsung.
4866,VIRG.,
4867,VIRG.,If I stand not absolutely condemned by my own rules; if I have hit the
4868,VIRG.,"spirit of ode in general; if I cannot think with Mr. Cowley, that ""Music"
4869,VIRG.,"alone, sometimes, makes an excellent ode;"""
4870,VIRG.,
4871,VIRG.,
4872,VIRG.,"Versus inopes rerum, nugæque canoræ;"
4873,VIRG.,
4874,VIRG.,
4875,VIRG.,"if there is any thought, enthusiasm, and picture, which are as the body,"
4876,VIRG.,"soul, and robe of poetry; in a word, if in any degree I have provided"
4877,VIRG.,"rather food for men, than air for wits; I hope smaller faults will meet"
4878,VIRG.,"indulgence for the sake of the design, which is the glory of my country"
4879,VIRG.,and my king.
4880,VIRG.,
4881,VIRG.,"And indeed, this may be said, in general, that great subjects are above"
4882,VIRG.,being nice; that dignity and spirit ever suffer from scrupulous exactness;
4883,VIRG.,And that the minuter cares effeminate a composition. Great masters of
4884,VIRG.,"poetry, painting, and statuary, in their nobler works, have even affected"
4885,VIRG.,the contrary: and justly; for a truly masculine air partakes more of the
4886,VIRG.,"negligent, than of the neat, both in writings, and in life--"

5498,EDWARD YOUNG.,And summon all their reason to the field:
5499,EDWARD YOUNG.,"So high at length their arguments were wrought,"
5500,EDWARD YOUNG.,They reach'd the last extent of human thought:
5501,EDWARD YOUNG.,"A pause ensu'd.--When, lo! Heaven interpos'd,"
5502,EDWARD YOUNG.,And awfully the long contention clos'd.
5503,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Full o'er their heads, with terrible surprise,"
5504,EDWARD YOUNG.,A sudden whirlwind blacken'd all the skies:
5505,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(They saw, and trembled!(27)) From the darkness broke"
5506,EDWARD YOUNG.,"A dreadful voice, and thus th' Almighty spoke."
5507,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who gives his tongue a loose so bold and vain,"
5508,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Censures my conduct, and reproves my reign?"
5509,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lifts up his thoughts against me from the dust,"
5510,EDWARD YOUNG.,And tells the world's Creator what is just?
5511,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Of late so brave, now lift a dauntless eye,"
5512,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Face my demand, and give it a reply:"
5513,EDWARD YOUNG.,Where didst thou dwell at nature's early birth?
5514,EDWARD YOUNG.,Who laid foundations for the spacious earth?
5515,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who on its surface did extend the line,"
5516,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Its form determine, and its bulk confine?"
5517,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who fix'd the corner-stone? What hand, declare,"
5518,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hung it on nought, and fasten'd it on air;"
5519,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When the bright morning stars in concert sung,"
5520,EDWARD YOUNG.,When heaven's high arch with loud hosannas rung;
5521,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When shouting sons of God the triumph crown'd,"
5522,EDWARD YOUNG.,And the wide concave thunder'd with the sound?
5523,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Earth's num'rous kingdoms, hast thou view'd them all?"
5524,EDWARD YOUNG.,And can thy span of knowledge grasp the ball?
5525,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who heav'd the mountain, which sublimely stands,"
5526,EDWARD YOUNG.,And casts its shadow into distant lands?
5527,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who, stretching forth his sceptre o'er the deep,"
5528,EDWARD YOUNG.,Can that wide world in due subjection keep?
5529,EDWARD YOUNG.,"I broke the globe, I scoop'd its hollow'd side,"
5530,EDWARD YOUNG.,And did a bason for the floods provide;
5531,EDWARD YOUNG.,"I chain'd them with my word; the boiling sea,"
5532,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Work'd up in tempests, hears my great decree;"
5533,EDWARD YOUNG.,"""(28)Thus far, thy floating tide shall be convey'd;"
5534,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And here, O main, be thy proud billows stay'd."""
5535,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hast thou explor'd the secrets of the deep,"
5536,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Where, shut from use, unnumber'd treasures sleep?"
5537,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Where, down a thousand fathoms from the day,"
5538,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Springs the great fountain, mother of the sea?"
5539,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Those gloomy paths did thy bold foot e'er tread,"
5540,EDWARD YOUNG.,Whole worlds of waters rolling o'er thy head?
5541,EDWARD YOUNG.,Hath the cleft centre open'd wide to thee?
5542,EDWARD YOUNG.,Death's inmost chambers didst thou ever see?
5543,EDWARD YOUNG.,"E'er knock at his tremendous gate, and wade"
5544,EDWARD YOUNG.,To the black portal through th' incumbent shade?
5545,EDWARD YOUNG.,Deep are those shades; but shades still deeper hide
5546,EDWARD YOUNG.,My counsels from the ken of human pride.
5547,EDWARD YOUNG.,Where dwells the light? In what refulgent dome?
5548,EDWARD YOUNG.,And where has darkness made her dismal home?
5549,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thou know'st, no doubt, since thy large heart is fraught"
5550,EDWARD YOUNG.,"With ripen'd wisdom, through long ages brought;"
5551,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Since nature was call'd forth when thou wast by,"
5552,EDWARD YOUNG.,And into being rose beneath thine eye!
5553,EDWARD YOUNG.,Are mists begotten? Who their father knew?
5554,EDWARD YOUNG.,From whom descend the pearly drops of dew?
5555,EDWARD YOUNG.,"To bind the stream by night, what hand can boast,"
5556,EDWARD YOUNG.,Or whiten morning with the hoary frost?
5557,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Whose powerful breath, from northern regions blown,"
5558,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Touches the sea, and turns it into stone?"
5559,EDWARD YOUNG.,The like spirit in these two passages is no bad concurrent
5560,EDWARD YOUNG.,"argument, that Moses is author of the book of Job.]"
5561,EDWARD YOUNG.,"A sudden desart spreads o'er realms defac'd,"
5562,EDWARD YOUNG.,And lays one half of the creation waste?
5563,EDWARD YOUNG.,Thou know'st me not; thy blindness cannot see
5564,EDWARD YOUNG.,How vast a distance parts thy God from thee.
5565,EDWARD YOUNG.,Canst thou in whirlwinds mount aloft? Canst thou
5566,EDWARD YOUNG.,In clouds and darkness wrap thy awful brow?
5567,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And, when day triumphs in meridian light,"
5568,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Put forth thy hand, and shade the world with night?"
5569,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who launch'd the clouds in air, and bid them roll"
5570,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Suspended seas aloft, from pole to pole?"
5571,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who can refresh the burning sandy plain,"
5572,EDWARD YOUNG.,And quench the summer with a waste of rain?
5573,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who, in rough desarts, far from human toil,"
5574,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Made rocks bring forth, and desolation smile?"
5575,EDWARD YOUNG.,"There blooms the rose, where human face ne'er shone,"
5576,EDWARD YOUNG.,And spreads its beauties to the sun alone.
5577,EDWARD YOUNG.,"To check the shower, who lifts his hand on high,"
5578,EDWARD YOUNG.,And shuts the sluices of th' exhausted sky
5579,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When earth no longer mourns her gaping veins,"
5580,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Her naked mountains, and her russet plains;"
5581,EDWARD YOUNG.,"But, new in life, a cheerful prospect yields"
5582,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Of shining rivers, and of verdant fields;"
5583,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When groves and forests lavish all their bloom,"
5584,EDWARD YOUNG.,And earth and heaven are fill'd with rich perfume?
5585,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hast thou e'er scal'd my wintry skies, and seen"
5586,EDWARD YOUNG.,Of hail and snows my northern magazine?
5587,EDWARD YOUNG.,"These the dread treasures of mine anger are,"
5588,EDWARD YOUNG.,"My funds of vengeance for the day of war,"
5589,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When clouds rain death, and storms, at my command,"
5590,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Rage through the world, or waste a guilty land."
5591,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who taught the rapid winds to fly so fast,"
5592,EDWARD YOUNG.,Or shakes the centre with his eastern blast?
5593,EDWARD YOUNG.,Who from the skies can a whole deluge pour?
5594,EDWARD YOUNG.,Who strikes through nature with the solemn roar
5595,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Of dreadful thunder, points it where to fall,"
5596,EDWARD YOUNG.,And in fierce lightning wraps the flying ball?
5597,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Not he who trembles at the darted fires,"
5598,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Falls at the sound, and in the flash expires."
5599,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who drew the comet out to such a size,"
5600,EDWARD YOUNG.,And pour'd his flaming train o'er half the skies?
5601,EDWARD YOUNG.,Did thy resentment hang him out? Does he
5602,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Glare on the nations, and denounce, from thee?"
5603,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who on low earth can moderate the rein,"
5604,EDWARD YOUNG.,That guides the stars along th' ethereal plain?
5605,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Appoint their seasons, and direct their course,"
5606,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Their lustre brighten, and supply their force?"
5607,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Canst thou the skies' benevolence restrain,"
5608,EDWARD YOUNG.,And cause the Pleiades to shine in vain?
5609,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Or, when Orion sparkles from his sphere,"
5610,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thaw the cold season, and unbind the year?"
5611,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Bid Mazzaroth his destin'd station know,"
5612,EDWARD YOUNG.,And teach the bright Arcturus where to glow?
5613,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Mine is the night, with all her stars; I pour"
5614,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Myriads, and myriads I reserve in store."
5615,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Dost thou pronounce where day-light shall be born,"
5616,EDWARD YOUNG.,And draw the purple curtain of the morn;
5617,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Awake the sun, and bid him come away,"
5618,EDWARD YOUNG.,And glad thy world with his obsequious ray?
5619,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hast thou, inthron'd in flaming glory, driven"
5620,EDWARD YOUNG.,Triumphant round the spacious ring of heaven?
5621,EDWARD YOUNG.,"That pomp of light, what hand so far displays,"
5622,EDWARD YOUNG.,That distant earth lies basking in the blaze?
5623,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who did the soul with her rich powers invest,"
5624,EDWARD YOUNG.,And light up reason in the human breast?
5625,EDWARD YOUNG.,"To shine, with fresh increase of lustre, bright,"
5626,EDWARD YOUNG.,When stars and sun are set in endless night?
5627,EDWARD YOUNG.,To these my various questions make reply.
5628,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Th' Almighty spoke; and, speaking, shook the sky."
5629,EDWARD YOUNG.,"What then, Chaldæan sire, was thy surprise!"
5630,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thus thou, with trembling heart, and downcast eyes:"
5631,EDWARD YOUNG.,"""Once and again, which I in groans deplore,"
5632,EDWARD YOUNG.,My tongue has err'd; but shall presume no more.
5633,EDWARD YOUNG.,"My voice is in eternal silence bound,"
5634,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And all my soul falls prostrate to the ground."""
5635,EDWARD YOUNG.,"He ceas'd: when, lo! again th' Almighty spoke;"
5636,EDWARD YOUNG.,The same dread voice from the black whirlwind broke.
5637,EDWARD YOUNG.,Can that arm measure with an arm divine?
5638,EDWARD YOUNG.,And canst thou thunder with a voice like mine?
5639,EDWARD YOUNG.,Or in the hollow of thy hand contain
5640,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The bulk of waters, the wide-spreading main,"
5641,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When, mad with tempests, all the billows rise"
5642,EDWARD YOUNG.,"In all their rage, and dash the distant skies?"
5643,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Come forth, in beauty's excellence array'd;"
5644,EDWARD YOUNG.,And be the grandeur of thy power display'd;
5645,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Put on omnipotence, and, frowning, make"
5646,EDWARD YOUNG.,The spacious round of the creation shake;
5647,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Dispatch thy vengeance, bid it overthow"
5648,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Triumphant vice, lay lofty tyrants low,"
5649,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And crumble them to dust. When this is done,"
5650,EDWARD YOUNG.,I grant thy safety lodg'd in thee alone;
5651,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Of thee thou art, and mayst undaunted stand"
5652,EDWARD YOUNG.,Behind the buckler of thine own right hand.
5653,EDWARD YOUNG.,Fond man! the vision of a moment made!
5654,EDWARD YOUNG.,Dream of a dream! and shadow of a shade!
5655,EDWARD YOUNG.,"What worlds hast thou produc'd, what creatures fram'd,"
5656,EDWARD YOUNG.,"What insects cherish'd, that thy God is blam'd?"
5657,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When (29)pain'd with hunger, the wild raven's brood"
5658,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Loud calls on God, importunate for food,"
5659,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who hears their cry, who grants their hoarse request,"
5660,EDWARD YOUNG.,And stills the clamour of the craving nest?
5661,EDWARD YOUNG.,Who in the stupid ostrich(30) has subdu'd
5662,EDWARD YOUNG.,"A parent's care, and fond inquietude?"
5663,EDWARD YOUNG.,"While far she flies, her scatter'd eggs are found,"
5664,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Without an owner, on the sandy ground;"
5665,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Cast out on fortune, they at mercy lie,"
5666,EDWARD YOUNG.,And borrow life from an indulgent sky;
5667,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Adopted by the sun, in blaze of day,"
5668,EDWARD YOUNG.,They ripen under his prolific ray.
5669,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Unmindful she, that some unhappy tread"
5670,EDWARD YOUNG.,May crush her young in their neglected bed.
5671,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(31)What time she skims along the field with speed,"
5672,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(32)She scorns the rider, and pursuing steed."
5673,EDWARD YOUNG.,How rich the peacock!(33) what bright glories run
5674,EDWARD YOUNG.,"From plume to plume, and vary in the sun!"
5675,EDWARD YOUNG.,"He proudly spreads them, to the golden ray"
5676,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Gives all his colours, and adorns the day;"
5677,EDWARD YOUNG.,"With conscious state the specious round displays,"
5678,EDWARD YOUNG.,And slowly moves amid the waving blaze.
5679,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who taught the hawk to find, in seasons wise,"
5680,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Perpetual summer, and a change of skies?"
5681,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When clouds deform the year, she mounts the wind,"
5682,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Shoots to the south, nor fears the storm behind;"
5683,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The sun returning, she returns again,"
5684,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lives in his beams, and leaves ill days to men."
5685,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Tho' strong the hawk,(34) tho' practis'd well to fly,"
5686,EDWARD YOUNG.,An eagle drops her in a lower sky;
5687,EDWARD YOUNG.,"An eagle, when, deserting human sight,"
5688,EDWARD YOUNG.,She seeks the sun in her unwearied flight:
5689,EDWARD YOUNG.,Did thy command her yellow pinion lift
5690,EDWARD YOUNG.,"So high in air, and set her on the clift,"
5691,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Where far above thy world she dwells alone,"
5692,EDWARD YOUNG.,And proudly makes the strength of rocks her own;
5693,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(35)Thence wide o'er nature takes her dread survey,"
5694,EDWARD YOUNG.,And with a glance predestinates her prey?
5695,EDWARD YOUNG.,"She feasts her young with blood; and, hov'ring o'er"
5696,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Th' unslaughter'd host, enjoys the promis'd gore."
5697,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(36)Know'st thou how many moons, by me assign'd,"
5698,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Roll o'er the mountain goat, and forest hind,"
5699,EDWARD YOUNG.,While pregnant they a mother's load sustain?
5700,EDWARD YOUNG.,"They bend in anguish, and cast forth their pain."
5701,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Hale are their young, from human frailties freed;"
5702,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Walk unsustain'd, and unassisted feed;"
5703,EDWARD YOUNG.,They live at once; forsake the dam's warm side;
5704,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Take the wide world, with nature for their guide;"
5705,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Bound o'er the lawn, or seek the distant glade;"
5706,EDWARD YOUNG.,And find a home in each delightful shade.
5707,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Will the tall reem, which knows no lord but me,"
5708,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Low at the crib, and ask an alms of thee;"
5709,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Submit his unworn shoulder to the yoke,"
5710,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Break the stiff clod, and o'er thy furrow smoke?"
5711,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Since great his strength, go trust him, void of care;"
5712,EDWARD YOUNG.,Lay on his neck the toil of all the year;
5713,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Bid him bring home the seasons to thy doors,"
5714,EDWARD YOUNG.,And cast his load among thy gather'd stores.
5715,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Didst thou from service the wild ass discharge,"
5716,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And break his bonds, and bid him live at large,"
5717,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Through the wide waste, his ample mansion, roam,"
5718,EDWARD YOUNG.,And lose himself in his unbounded home?
5719,EDWARD YOUNG.,"By nature's hand magnificently fed,"
5720,EDWARD YOUNG.,His meal is on the range of mountains spread;
5721,EDWARD YOUNG.,"As in pure air aloft he bounds along,"
5722,EDWARD YOUNG.,He sees in distant smoke the city throng;
5723,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Conscious of freedom, scorns the smother'd train,"
5724,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The threat'ning driver, and the servile rein."
5725,EDWARD YOUNG.,Survey the warlike horse! didst thou invest
5726,EDWARD YOUNG.,With thunder his robust distended chest?
5727,EDWARD YOUNG.,No sense of fear his dauntless soul allays;
5728,EDWARD YOUNG.,'Tis dreadful to behold his nostrils blaze;
5729,EDWARD YOUNG.,"To paw the vale he proudly takes delight,"
5730,EDWARD YOUNG.,And triumphs in the fulness of his might;
5731,EDWARD YOUNG.,"High rais'd he snuffs the battle from afar,"
5732,EDWARD YOUNG.,And burns to plunge amid the raging war;
5733,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And mocks at death, and throws his foam around,"
5734,EDWARD YOUNG.,And in a storm of fury shakes the ground.
5735,EDWARD YOUNG.,"How does his firm, his rising heart, advance"
5736,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Full on the brandish'd sword, and shaken lance;"
5737,EDWARD YOUNG.,"While his fix'd eyeballs meet the dazzling shield,"
5738,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Gaze, and return the lightning of the field!"
5739,EDWARD YOUNG.,"He sinks the sense of pain in gen'rous pride,"
5740,EDWARD YOUNG.,Nor feels the shaft that trembles in his side;
5741,EDWARD YOUNG.,But neighs to the shrill trumpet's dreadful blast
5742,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Till death; and when he groans, he groans his last."
5743,EDWARD YOUNG.,"But, fiercer still, the lordly lion stalks,"
5744,EDWARD YOUNG.,Grimly majestic in his lonely walks;
5745,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When round he glares, all living creatures fly;"
5746,EDWARD YOUNG.,He clears the desart with his rolling eye.
5747,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Say, mortal, does he rouse at thy command,"
5748,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And roar to thee, and live upon thy hand?"
5749,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Dost thou for him in forests bend thy bow,"
5750,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And to his gloomy den the morsel throw,"
5751,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Where bent on death lie hid his tawny brood,"
5752,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And, couch'd in dreadful ambush, pant for blood;"
5753,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Or, stretch'd on broken limbs, consume the day,"
5754,EDWARD YOUNG.,"In darkness wrapt, and slumber o'er their prey?"
5755,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(37)By the pale moon they take their destin'd round,"
5756,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And lash their sides, and furious tear the ground."
5757,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Now shrieks, and dying groans, the desart fill;"
5758,EDWARD YOUNG.,"They rage, they rend; their rav'nous jaws distill"
5759,EDWARD YOUNG.,"With crimson foam; and, when the banquet's o'er,"
5760,EDWARD YOUNG.,"They stride away, and paint their steps with gore;"
5761,EDWARD YOUNG.,"In flight alone the shepherd puts his trust,"
5762,EDWARD YOUNG.,And shudders at the talon in the dust.
5763,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Mild is my behemoth, though large his frame;"
5764,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Smooth is his temper, and represt his flame,"
5765,EDWARD YOUNG.,While unprovok'd. This native of the flood
5766,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lifts his broad foot, and puts ashore for food;"
5767,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Earth sinks beneath him, as he moves along"
5768,EDWARD YOUNG.,"To seek the herbs, and mingle with the throng."
5769,EDWARD YOUNG.,"See with what strength his harden'd loins are bound,"
5770,EDWARD YOUNG.,All over proof and shut against a wound.
5771,EDWARD YOUNG.,How like a mountain cedar moves his tail!
5772,EDWARD YOUNG.,Nor can his complicated sinews fail.
5773,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Built high and wide, his solid bones surpass"
5774,EDWARD YOUNG.,The bars of steel; his ribs are ribs of brass;
5775,EDWARD YOUNG.,"His port majestic, and his armed jaw,"
5776,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Give the wide forest, and the mountain, law."
5777,EDWARD YOUNG.,The mountains feed him; there the beasts admire
5778,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The mighty stranger, and in dread retire:"
5779,EDWARD YOUNG.,"At length his greatness nearer they survey,"
5780,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Graze in his shadow, and his eye obey."
5781,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The fens and marshes are his cool retreat,"
5782,EDWARD YOUNG.,His noontide shelter from the burning heat;
5783,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Their sedgy bosoms his wide couch are made,"
5784,EDWARD YOUNG.,And groves of willows give him all their shade.
5785,EDWARD YOUNG.,"His eye drinks Jordan up, when, fir'd with drought,"
5786,EDWARD YOUNG.,He trusts to turn its current down his throat;
5787,EDWARD YOUNG.,In lessen'd waves it creeps along the plain:
5788,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(38)He sinks a river, and he thirsts again."
5789,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(39)Go to the Nile, and, from its fruitful side,"
5790,EDWARD YOUNG.,Cast forth thy line into the swelling tide:
5791,EDWARD YOUNG.,"With slender hair leviathan command,"
5792,EDWARD YOUNG.,And stretch his vastness on the loaded strand.
5793,EDWARD YOUNG.,Will he become thy servant? Will he own
5794,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thy lordly nod, and tremble at thy frown?"
5795,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Or with his sport amuse thy leisure day,"
5796,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And, bound in silk, with thy soft maidens play?"
5797,EDWARD YOUNG.,Shall pompous banquets swell with such a prize?
5798,EDWARD YOUNG.,And the bowl journey round his ample size?
5799,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Or the debating merchants share the prey,"
5800,EDWARD YOUNG.,And various limbs to various marts convey?
5801,EDWARD YOUNG.,Thro' his firm skull what steel its way can win?
5802,EDWARD YOUNG.,What forceful engine can subdue his skin?
5803,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Fly far, and live; tempt not his matchless might:"
5804,EDWARD YOUNG.,The bravest shrink to cowards in his sight;
5805,EDWARD YOUNG.,(40)The rashest dare not rouse him up: Who then
5806,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Shall turn on me, among the sons of men?"
5807,EDWARD YOUNG.,Am I a debtor? Hast thou ever heard
5808,EDWARD YOUNG.,Whence come the gifts that are on me conferr'd?
5809,EDWARD YOUNG.,"My lavish fruit a thousand valleys fills,"
5810,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And mine the herds, that graze a thousand hills:"
5811,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Earth, sea, and air, all nature is my own;"
5812,EDWARD YOUNG.,And stars and sun are dust beneath my throne.
5813,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And dar'st thou with the world's great Father vie,"
5814,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thou, who dost tremble at my creature's eye?"
5815,EDWARD YOUNG.,"At full my huge leviathan shall rise,"
5816,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Boast all his strength, and spread his wondrous size."
5817,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Who, great in arms, e'er stripp'd his shining mail,"
5818,EDWARD YOUNG.,Or crown'd his triumph with a single scale?
5819,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Whose heart sustains him to draw near? (41)Behold,"
5820,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Destruction yawns; his spacious jaws unfold,"
5821,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And, marshall'd round the wide expanse, disclose"
5822,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Teeth edg'd with death, and crowding rows on rows:"
5823,EDWARD YOUNG.,What hideous fangs on either side arise!
5824,EDWARD YOUNG.,And what a deep abyss between them lies!
5825,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Mete with thy lance, and with thy plummet sound,"
5826,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The one how long, the other how profound."
5827,EDWARD YOUNG.,"His bulk is charg'd with such a furious soul,"
5828,EDWARD YOUNG.,"That clouds of smoke from his spread nostrils roll,"
5829,EDWARD YOUNG.,"As from a furnace; and, when rous'd his ire,"
5830,EDWARD YOUNG.,(42)Fate issues from his jaws in streams of fire.
5831,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The rage of tempests, and the roar of seas,"
5832,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Thy terror, this thy great superior please;"
5833,EDWARD YOUNG.,Strength on his ample shoulder sits in state;
5834,EDWARD YOUNG.,His well-join'd limbs are dreadfully complete;
5835,EDWARD YOUNG.,His flakes of solid flesh are slow to part;
5836,EDWARD YOUNG.,"As steel his nerves, as adamant his heart."
5837,EDWARD YOUNG.,"When, late awak'd, he rears him from the floods,"
5838,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And, stretching forth his stature to the clouds,"
5839,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Writhes in the sun aloft his scaly height,"
5840,EDWARD YOUNG.,"And strikes the distant hills with transient light,"
5841,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Far round are fatal damps of terror spread,"
5842,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The mighty fear, nor blush to own their dread."
5843,EDWARD YOUNG.,"(43)Large is his front; and, when his burnish'd eyes"
5844,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Lift their broad lids, the morning seems to rise."
5845,EDWARD YOUNG.,"In vain may death in various shapes invade,"
5846,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The swift-wing'd arrow, the descending blade;"
5847,EDWARD YOUNG.,His naked breast their impotence defies;
5848,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The dart rebounds, the brittle fauchion flies."
5849,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Shut in himself, the war without he hears,"
5850,EDWARD YOUNG.,Safe in the tempest of their rattling spears;
5851,EDWARD YOUNG.,The cumber'd strand their wasted volleys strow;
5852,EDWARD YOUNG.,"His sport, the rage and labour of the foe."
5853,EDWARD YOUNG.,"His pastimes like a cauldron boil the flood,"
5854,EDWARD YOUNG.,And blacken ocean with the rising mud;
5855,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The billows feel him, as he works his way;"
5856,EDWARD YOUNG.,His hoary footsteps shine along the sea;
5857,EDWARD YOUNG.,"The foam high-wrought, with white divides the green,"
5858,EDWARD YOUNG.,And distant sailors point where death has been.
5859,EDWARD YOUNG.,His like earth bears not on her spacious face:
5860,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Alone in nature stands his dauntless race,"
5861,EDWARD YOUNG.,"For utter ignorance of fear renown'd,"
5862,EDWARD YOUNG.,In wrath he rolls his baleful eye around:
5863,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Makes every swoln, disdainful heart, subside,"
5864,EDWARD YOUNG.,And holds dominion o'er the sons of pride.
5865,EDWARD YOUNG.,"Then the Chaldæan eas'd his lab'ring breast,"

6134,--VIRG.,"A glory more sublime remains in store,"
6135,--VIRG.,"Since such his talents, that he sung no more."
6136,--VIRG.,"No fuller proof of power th' Almighty gave,"
6137,--VIRG.,"Making the sea, than curbing her proud wave."
6138,--VIRG.,"Nought can the genius of his works transcend,"
6139,--VIRG.,But their fair purpose and important end;
6140,--VIRG.,"To rouse the war for injur'd Europe's laws,"
6141,--VIRG.,To steel the patriot in great Brunswick's cause;
6142,--VIRG.,"With virtue's charms to kindle sacred love,"
6143,--VIRG.,Or paint th' eternal bowers of bliss above.
6144,--VIRG.,"Where hadst thou room, great author! where to roll"
6145,--VIRG.,The mighty theme of an immortal soul?
6146,--VIRG.,"Through paths unknown, unbeaten, whence were brought"

6154,--VIRG.,"His glory such, it borders on disgrace"
6155,--VIRG.,To say he sung the best of human race.
6156,--VIRG.,"In joy once join'd, in sorrow now for years,"
6157,--VIRG.,"Partner in grief, and brother of my tears,"
6158,--VIRG.,"Tickell! accept this verse, thy mournful due;"
6159,--VIRG.,Thou further shalt the sacred theme pursue;
6160,--VIRG.,"And, as thy strain describes the matchless man,"
6161,--VIRG.,Thy life shall second what thy muse began.
6162,--VIRG.,"Though sweet the numbers, though a fire divine"
6163,--VIRG.,"Dart through the whole, and burn in every line,"
6164,--VIRG.,"Who strives not for that excellence he draws,"
6165,--VIRG.,"Is stain'd by fame, and suffers from applause."
6166,--VIRG.,But haste to thy illustrious task; prepare
6167,--VIRG.,"The noble work well trusted to thy care,"
6168,--VIRG.,"The gift(47) bequeath'd by Addison's command,"
6169,--VIRG.,To Craggs made sacred by his dying hand.

6175,--VIRG.,In generous anguish o'er the glorious pile;
6176,--VIRG.,"With anxious pleasure the known page reviews,"

6590,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Nor know'st thou which will win.--Know then from me,"

6592,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"State ministers, as upright or corrupt,"
6593,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Are balm or poison in a nation's veins!
6594,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Health or distemper, hasten or retard"

6600,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Virtue and vice are empire's life and death."""
6601,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,
6602,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Thus it is written--Heard you not a groan?
6603,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Is Britain on her death-bed?--No, that groan"
6604,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Was utter'd by her foes--but soon the scale,"
6605,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"If this divine monition is despis'd,"
6606,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"May turn against us. Read it, ye who rule!"
6607,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,With reverence read; with steadfastness believe;
6608,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,With courage act as such belief inspires;
6609,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Then shall your glory stand like fate's decree;
6610,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Then shall your name in adamant be writ,"
6611,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"In records that defy the tooth of time,"
6612,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"By nations sav'd, resounding your applause."
6613,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"While deep beyond your monument's proud base,"
6614,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"In black oblivion's kennel, shall be trod"
6615,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Their execrable names, who, high in power,"

6619,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Quench every spark of conscience in the land,"
6620,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,And triumph in the profligate's applause:
6621,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Or who to the first bidder sell their souls,"
6622,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Their country sell, sell all their fathers bought"
6623,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"With funds exhausted and exhausted veins,"
6624,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"To demons, by his holiness ordain'd"

6626,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Hawk'd through the world by consecrated bulls;
6627,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,And how illustrated?--by Smithfleld flames:
6628,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Who plunge (but not like Curtius) down the gulf,"
6629,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Down narrow-minded self's voracious gulf,"
6630,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Which gapes and swallows all they swore to save:
6631,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Hate all that lifted heroes into gods,"

6637,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Note, here, my lord, (unnoted yet it lies"
6638,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"By most, or all,) these truths political"
6639,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Serve more than public ends: this creed of states
6640,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Seconds, and irresistibly supports,"
6641,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,The Christian creed. Are you surpris'd?--Attend
6642,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,And on the statesman's build a nobler name.
6643,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"This punctual justice exercis'd on states,"
6644,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"With which authentic chronicle abounds,"
6645,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"As all men know, and therefore must believe;"
6646,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"This vengeance pour'd on nations ripe in guilt,"
6647,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Pour'd on them here, where only they exist,"
6648,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"What is it but an argument of sense,"
6649,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Or rather demonstration, to support"
6650,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Our feeble faith--""That they who states compose,"
6651,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"That men who stand not bounded by the grave,"
6652,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Shall meet like measure at their proper hour?"""
6653,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"For God is equal, similarly deals"
6654,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"With states and persons, or he were not God!"
6655,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,What means a rectitude immutable?
6656,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,A pattern here of universal right.
6657,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"What, then, shall rescue an abandon'd man?"
6658,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Nothing, it is replied. Replied, by whom?"
6659,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Replied by politicians well as priests:
6660,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Writ sacred set aside, mankind's own writ,"
6661,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,The whole world's annals; these pronounce his doom.
6662,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Thus (what might seem a daring paradox)
6663,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,E'en politics advance divinity:
6664,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"True masters there are better scholars here,"
6665,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Who travel history in quest of schemes
6666,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"To govern nations, or perhaps oppress,"
6667,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"May there start truths that other aims inspire,"
6668,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"And, like Candace's eunuch, as they read,"
6669,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,By Providence turn Christians on their road:
6670,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Digging for silver, they may strike on gold;"
6671,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"May be surpris'd with better than they sought,"
6672,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,And entertain an angel unawares.
6673,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Nor is divinity ungrateful found.
6674,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"As politics advance divinity,"
6675,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Thus, in return, divinity promotes"
6676,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"True politics, and crowns the statesman's praise."
6677,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"All wisdoms are but branches of the chief,"
6678,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,And statesmen found but shoots of honest men.
6679,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Are this world's witchcrafts pleaded in excuse
6680,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,For deviations in our moral line?
6681,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"This, and the next world, view'd with such an eye"
6682,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"As suits a statesman, such as keeps in view"
6683,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"His own exalted science, both conspire"
6684,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,To recommend and fix us in the right.
6685,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"If we reward the politics of Heaven,"
6686,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"The grand administration of the whole,"
6687,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,What's the next world? A supplement of this:
6688,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Without it, justice is defective here;"
6689,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Just as to states, defective as to men:"
6690,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"If so, what is this world? As sure as right"
6691,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Sits in Heaven's throne, a prophet of the next."
6692,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Prize you the prophet? then believe him too:
6693,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,His prophecy more precious than his smile.
6694,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"How comes it then to pass, with most on earth,"
6695,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"That this should charm us, that should discompose?"
6696,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Long as the statesman finds this case his own,"
6697,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,So long his politics are uncomplete;
6698,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"In danger he; nor is the nation safe,"
6699,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,But soon must rue his inauspicious power.
6700,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,What hence results? a truth that should resound
6701,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,For ever awful in Britannia's ear:
6702,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"""Religion crowns the statesman and the man,"
6703,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Sole source of public and of private peace."""
6704,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"This truth all men must own, and therefore will,"
6705,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"And praise and preach it too:--and when that's done,"
6706,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Their compliment is paid, and 'tis forgot."
6707,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,What highland pole-axe half so deep can wound?
6708,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"But how dare I, so mean, presume so far?"
6709,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Assume my seat in the dictator's chair?
6710,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Pronounce, predict (as if indeed inspir'd),"
6711,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Promulge my censures, lay out all my throat,"
6712,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Till hoarse in clamour on enormous crimes?
6713,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Two mighty columns rise in my support;
6714,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"In their more awful and authentic voice,"
6715,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Record profane and sacred, drown the muse,"
6716,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Tho' loud, and far out-thread her threatening song."
6717,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Still further, Holles! suffer me to plead"
6718,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"That I speak freely, as I speak to thee:"
6719,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Guilt only startles at the name of guilt;
6720,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"And truth, plain truth, is welcome to the wise."
6721,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Thus what seem'd my presumption is thy praise.
6722,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Praise, and immortal praise, is virtue's claim;"
6723,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,And virtue's sphere is action: yet we grant
6724,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Some merit to the trumpet's loud alarm,"
6725,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Whose clangour kindles cowards into men.
6726,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Nor shall the verse, perhaps, be quite forgot,"
6727,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Which talks of immortality, and bids,"
6728,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"In every British breast, true glory rise,"
6729,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,As now the warbling lark awakes the morn.
6730,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"To close, my lord! with that which all should close"
6731,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"And all begin, and strike us every hour,"
6732,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Though no war wak'd us, no black tempest frown'd."
6733,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,The morning rises gay; yet gayest morn
6734,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Less glorious after night's incumbent shades;
6735,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Less glorious far bright nature, rich array'd"
6736,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"With golden robes, in all the pomp of noon,"
6737,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Than the first feeble dawn of moral day?
6738,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Sole day, (let those whom statesmen serve attend,)"
6739,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Though the sun ripens diamonds for their crowns;
6740,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Sole day worth his regard whom Heaven ordains,"
6741,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Undarken'd, to behold noon dark, and date,"
6742,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"From the sun's death, and every planet's fall,"
6743,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,His all-illustrious and eternal year;
6744,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"Where statesmen and their monarchs, (names of awe"
6745,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,"And distance here,) shall rank with common men,"
6746,THE STATEMAN'S CREED.,Yet own their glory never dawn'd before.

6868,RESIGNATION.,
6869,RESIGNATION.,"O resignation! yet unsung,"
6870,RESIGNATION.,Untouch'd by former strains;
6871,RESIGNATION.,"Though claiming every muse's smile,"
6872,RESIGNATION.,"And every poet's pains,"
6873,RESIGNATION.,
6874,RESIGNATION.,"Beneath life's evening, solemn shade,"
6875,RESIGNATION.,I dedicate my page
6876,RESIGNATION.,"To thee, thou safest guard of youth!"
6877,RESIGNATION.,Thou sole support of age!
6878,RESIGNATION.,
6879,RESIGNATION.,All other duties crescents are
6880,RESIGNATION.,"Of virtue faintly bright,"
6881,RESIGNATION.,"The glorious consummation, thou!"
6882,RESIGNATION.,Which fills her orb with light:
6883,RESIGNATION.,
6884,RESIGNATION.,How rarely fill'd! the love divine
6885,RESIGNATION.,"In evils to discern,"
6886,RESIGNATION.,"This the first lesson which we want,"
6887,RESIGNATION.,"The latest, which we learn;"
6888,RESIGNATION.,
6889,RESIGNATION.,"A melancholy truth! for know,"

6898,RESIGNATION.,
6899,RESIGNATION.,The task I dread; dare I to leave

6901,RESIGNATION.,And put to sea? a dangerous sea?
6902,RESIGNATION.,What throngs have sunk before!
6903,RESIGNATION.,
6904,RESIGNATION.,How proud the poet's billow swells!
6905,RESIGNATION.,The God! the God! his boast:

6929,RESIGNATION.,"The ghost of grief deceas'd ascends,"
6930,RESIGNATION.,His old wound bleeds anew;
6931,RESIGNATION.,His sorrows are recall'd to life
6932,RESIGNATION.,By those he sees in you;
6933,RESIGNATION.,
6934,RESIGNATION.,Too well he knows the twisting strings
6935,RESIGNATION.,Of ardent hearts combin'd
6936,RESIGNATION.,"When rent asunder, how they bleed,"
6937,RESIGNATION.,How hard to be resign'd:

6959,RESIGNATION.,"It plucks the frightful mask from ills,"
6960,RESIGNATION.,"Forbids pale fear to hide,"
6961,RESIGNATION.,"Beneath that dark disguise, a friend,"
6962,RESIGNATION.,Which turns affection's tide.
6963,RESIGNATION.,
6964,RESIGNATION.,"Affection frail! train'd up by sense,"
6965,RESIGNATION.,From reason's channel strays:

7019,RESIGNATION.,
7020,RESIGNATION.,From virtue's rugged path to right

7044,RESIGNATION.,
7045,RESIGNATION.,"But not deferr'd your joy so long,"
7046,RESIGNATION.,It bears an early date;
7047,RESIGNATION.,"Affliction's ready pay in hand,"

7054,RESIGNATION.,
7055,RESIGNATION.,"Grief softens hearts, and curbs the will,"
7056,RESIGNATION.,"Impetuous passion tames,"

7105,RESIGNATION.,"To resignation swift he flew,"
7106,RESIGNATION.,"In her a friend he found,"
7107,RESIGNATION.,"A friend, which bless'd him with a smile"
7108,RESIGNATION.,When gasping with his wound.
7109,RESIGNATION.,
7110,RESIGNATION.,On earth nought precious is obtain'd
7111,RESIGNATION.,But what is painful too;

7114,RESIGNATION.,
7115,RESIGNATION.,"To real joy we work our way,"
7116,RESIGNATION.,"Encountering many a shock,"
7117,RESIGNATION.,Ere found what truly charms; as found

7139,RESIGNATION.,
7140,RESIGNATION.,"This moment, am I deeply stung--"

7170,RESIGNATION.,Madam! I grant your loss is great;

7174,RESIGNATION.,
7175,RESIGNATION.,"When heaven would kindly set us free,"
7176,RESIGNATION.,And earth's enchantment end;
7177,RESIGNATION.,"It takes the most effectual means,"
7178,RESIGNATION.,And robs us of a friend.
7179,RESIGNATION.,
7180,RESIGNATION.,But such a friend! and sigh no more?
7181,RESIGNATION.,'Tis prudent; but severe:
7182,RESIGNATION.,"Heaven aid my weakness, and I drop"

7189,RESIGNATION.,
7190,RESIGNATION.,"Whose frequent aid brought kind relief,"
7191,RESIGNATION.,"In my distress of thought,"
7192,RESIGNATION.,"Ting'd with his beams my cloudy page,"
7193,RESIGNATION.,And beautified a fault:
7194,RESIGNATION.,
7195,RESIGNATION.,To touch our passions' secret springs
7196,RESIGNATION.,Was his peculiar care;
7197,RESIGNATION.,And deep his happy genius div'd
7198,RESIGNATION.,In bosoms of the fair;
7199,RESIGNATION.,
7200,RESIGNATION.,"Nature, which favours to the few,"
7201,RESIGNATION.,"All art beyond, imparts,"
7202,RESIGNATION.,"To him presented, at his birth,"
7203,RESIGNATION.,The key of human hearts.
7204,RESIGNATION.,
7205,RESIGNATION.,But not to me by him bequeath'd
7206,RESIGNATION.,"His gentle, smooth address;"
7207,RESIGNATION.,His tender hand to touch the wound
7208,RESIGNATION.,In throbbing of distress;
7209,RESIGNATION.,
7210,RESIGNATION.,"Howe'er, proceed I must, unbless'd"
7211,RESIGNATION.,With Esculapian art:
7212,RESIGNATION.,"Know, love sometimes, mistaken love!"
7213,RESIGNATION.,Plays disaffection's part:
7214,RESIGNATION.,
7215,RESIGNATION.,"Nor lands, nor seas, nor suns, nor stars,"
7216,RESIGNATION.,Can soul from soul divide;
7217,RESIGNATION.,"They correspond from distant worlds,"
7218,RESIGNATION.,Though transports are denied:
7219,RESIGNATION.,
7220,RESIGNATION.,"Are you not, then, unkindly kind?"
7221,RESIGNATION.,Is not your love severe?
7222,RESIGNATION.,O! stop that crystal source of woe;
7223,RESIGNATION.,Nor wound him with a tear.
7224,RESIGNATION.,
7225,RESIGNATION.,As those above from human bliss
7226,RESIGNATION.,Receive increase of joy;
7227,RESIGNATION.,"May not a stroke from human woe,"
7228,RESIGNATION.,"In part, their peace destroy?"
7229,RESIGNATION.,
7230,RESIGNATION.,He lives in those he left;--to what?
7231,RESIGNATION.,"Your, now, paternal care,"
7232,RESIGNATION.,"Clear from its cloud your brighten'd eye,"
7233,RESIGNATION.,It will discern him there;
7234,RESIGNATION.,
7235,RESIGNATION.,"In features, not of form alone,"
7236,RESIGNATION.,"But those, I trust, of mind;"
7237,RESIGNATION.,"Auspicious to the public weal,"
7238,RESIGNATION.,And to their fate resign'd.
7239,RESIGNATION.,
7240,RESIGNATION.,Think on the tempests he sustain'd;
7241,RESIGNATION.,Revolve his battles won;
7242,RESIGNATION.,And let those prophesy your joy
7243,RESIGNATION.,From such a father's son:
7244,RESIGNATION.,
7245,RESIGNATION.,Is consolation what you seek?
7246,RESIGNATION.,"Fan, then, his martial fire:"
7247,RESIGNATION.,And animate to flame the sparks
7248,RESIGNATION.,Bequeath'd him by his sire:
7249,RESIGNATION.,
7250,RESIGNATION.,"As nothing great is born in haste,"
7251,RESIGNATION.,Wise nature's time allow;
7252,RESIGNATION.,"His father's laurels may descend,"
7253,RESIGNATION.,And flourish on his brow.
7254,RESIGNATION.,
7255,RESIGNATION.,"Nor, madam! be surpris'd to hear"
7256,RESIGNATION.,That laurels may be due
7257,RESIGNATION.,"Not more to heroes of the field,"
7258,RESIGNATION.,(Proud boasters!) than to you:
7259,RESIGNATION.,
7260,RESIGNATION.,"Tender as is the female frame,"
7261,RESIGNATION.,"Like that brave man you mourn,"
7262,RESIGNATION.,"You are a soldier, and to fight"
7263,RESIGNATION.,Superior battles born;
7264,RESIGNATION.,
7265,RESIGNATION.,Beneath a banner nobler far
7266,RESIGNATION.,Than ever was unfurl'd
7267,RESIGNATION.,In fields of blood; a banner bright!

7274,RESIGNATION.,
7275,RESIGNATION.,"Beneath that banner, what exploit"
7276,RESIGNATION.,"Can mount our glory higher,"
7277,RESIGNATION.,"Than to sustain the dreadful blow,"
7278,RESIGNATION.,When those we love expire?
7279,RESIGNATION.,
7280,RESIGNATION.,Go forth a moral Amazon;
7281,RESIGNATION.,Arm'd with undaunted thought;
7282,RESIGNATION.,"The battle won, though costing dear,"
7283,RESIGNATION.,You'll think it cheaply bought:
7284,RESIGNATION.,
7285,RESIGNATION.,"The passive hero, who sits down"
7286,RESIGNATION.,"Unactive, and can smile"
7287,RESIGNATION.,"Beneath affliction's galling load,"
7288,RESIGNATION.,Out-acts a Cæsar's toil:
7289,RESIGNATION.,
7290,RESIGNATION.,The billows stain'd by slaughter'd foes
7291,RESIGNATION.,Inferior praise afford;
7292,RESIGNATION.,"Reason's a bloodless conqueror,"
7293,RESIGNATION.,More glorious than the sword.
7294,RESIGNATION.,
7295,RESIGNATION.,"Nor can the thunders of huzzas,"
7296,RESIGNATION.,"From shouting nations, cause"
7297,RESIGNATION.,"Such sweet delight, as from your heart"
7298,RESIGNATION.,Soft whispers of applause:
7299,RESIGNATION.,
7300,RESIGNATION.,"The dear deceas'd so fam'd in arms,"
7301,RESIGNATION.,With what delight he'll view
7302,RESIGNATION.,"His triumphs on the main outdone,"
7303,RESIGNATION.,"Thus conquer'd, twice, by you."
7304,RESIGNATION.,
7305,RESIGNATION.,Share his delight; take heed to shun
7306,RESIGNATION.,Of bosoms most diseas'd
7307,RESIGNATION.,"That odd distemper, an absurd"
7308,RESIGNATION.,Reluctance to be pleas'd:
7309,RESIGNATION.,
7310,RESIGNATION.,"Some seem in love with sorrow's charms,"
7311,RESIGNATION.,And that foul fiend embrace:
7312,RESIGNATION.,"This temper let me justly brand,"
7313,RESIGNATION.,And stamp it with disgrace:
7314,RESIGNATION.,
7315,RESIGNATION.,Sorrow! of horrid parentage!
7316,RESIGNATION.,Thou second-born of hell!
7317,RESIGNATION.,Against heaven's endless mercies pour'd
7318,RESIGNATION.,How dar'st thou to rebel?
7319,RESIGNATION.,
7320,RESIGNATION.,"From black and noxious vapours bred,"
7321,RESIGNATION.,"And nurs'd by want of thought,"
7322,RESIGNATION.,And to the door of phrensy's self
7323,RESIGNATION.,"By perseverance brought,"
7324,RESIGNATION.,
7325,RESIGNATION.,"Thy most inglorious, coward tears"
7326,RESIGNATION.,From brutal eyes have ran:
7327,RESIGNATION.,"Smiles, incommunicable smiles!"
7328,RESIGNATION.,Are radiant marks of man;
7329,RESIGNATION.,
7330,RESIGNATION.,They cast a sudden glory round
7331,RESIGNATION.,Th' illumin'd human face;
7332,RESIGNATION.,And light in sons of honest joy
7333,RESIGNATION.,Some beams of Moses' face:
7334,RESIGNATION.,
7335,RESIGNATION.,Is resignation's lesson hard?
7336,RESIGNATION.,"Examine, we shall find"
7337,RESIGNATION.,That duty gives up little more
7338,RESIGNATION.,Than anguish of the mind;
7339,RESIGNATION.,
7340,RESIGNATION.,Resign; and all the load of life
7341,RESIGNATION.,"That moment you remove,"
7342,RESIGNATION.,"Its heavy tax, ten thousand cares"
7343,RESIGNATION.,Devolve on one above;
7344,RESIGNATION.,
7345,RESIGNATION.,Who bids us lay our burthen down
7346,RESIGNATION.,"On his almighty hand,"
7347,RESIGNATION.,"Softens our duty to relief,"
7348,RESIGNATION.,To blessing a command.
7349,RESIGNATION.,
7350,RESIGNATION.,For joy what cause! how every sense
7351,RESIGNATION.,Is courted from above
7352,RESIGNATION.,"The year around, with presents rich,"
7353,RESIGNATION.,The growth of endless love!
7354,RESIGNATION.,
7355,RESIGNATION.,"But most o'erlook the blessings pour'd,"
7356,RESIGNATION.,"Forget the wonders done,"
7357,RESIGNATION.,"And terminate, wrapp'd up in sense,"
7358,RESIGNATION.,Their prospect at the sun;
7359,RESIGNATION.,
7360,RESIGNATION.,"From that, their final point of view,"
7361,RESIGNATION.,"From that their radiant goal,"
7362,RESIGNATION.,"On travel infinite of thought,"
7363,RESIGNATION.,"Sets out the nobler soul,"
7364,RESIGNATION.,
7365,RESIGNATION.,"Broke loose from time's tenacious ties,"
7366,RESIGNATION.,"And earth's involving gloom,"
7367,RESIGNATION.,"To range at last its vast domain,"
7368,RESIGNATION.,And talk with worlds to come:
7369,RESIGNATION.,
7370,RESIGNATION.,"They let unmark'd, and unemploy'd,"
7371,RESIGNATION.,Life's idle moments run;
7372,RESIGNATION.,"And doing nothing for themselves,"
7373,RESIGNATION.,Imagine nothing done;
7374,RESIGNATION.,
7375,RESIGNATION.,"Fatal mistake! their fate goes on,"
7376,RESIGNATION.,"Their dread account proceeds,"
7377,RESIGNATION.,And their not doing is set down
7378,RESIGNATION.,Amongst their darkest deeds;
7379,RESIGNATION.,
7380,RESIGNATION.,"Though man sits still, and takes his ease;"
7381,RESIGNATION.,God is at work on man;
7382,RESIGNATION.,"No means, no moment unemployed,"
7383,RESIGNATION.,"To bless him, if he can."
7384,RESIGNATION.,
7385,RESIGNATION.,"But man consents not, boldly bent"
7386,RESIGNATION.,To fashion his own fate;
7387,RESIGNATION.,"Man, a mere bungler in the trade,"
7388,RESIGNATION.,Repents his crime too late;
7389,RESIGNATION.,
7390,RESIGNATION.,"Hence loud laments: let me thy cause,"
7391,RESIGNATION.,Indulgent father! plead;
7392,RESIGNATION.,"Of all the wretches we deplore,"
7393,RESIGNATION.,Not one by thee was made.
7394,RESIGNATION.,
7395,RESIGNATION.,What is thy whole creation fair?
7396,RESIGNATION.,Of love divine the child;
7397,RESIGNATION.,"Love brought it forth; and, from its birth,"
7398,RESIGNATION.,Has o'er it fondly smil'd:
7399,RESIGNATION.,
7400,RESIGNATION.,"Now, and through periods distant far,"
7401,RESIGNATION.,"Long ere the world began,"
7402,RESIGNATION.,"Heaven is, and has in travail been,"
7403,RESIGNATION.,Its birth the good of man;
7404,RESIGNATION.,
7405,RESIGNATION.,Man holds in constant service bound
7406,RESIGNATION.,The blustering winds and seas;
7407,RESIGNATION.,Nor suns disdain to travel hard
7408,RESIGNATION.,"Their master, man, to please:"
7409,RESIGNATION.,
7410,RESIGNATION.,To final good the worst events
7411,RESIGNATION.,Through secret channels run;
7412,RESIGNATION.,"Finish for man their destin'd course,"
7413,RESIGNATION.,As 'twas for man begun.
7414,RESIGNATION.,
7415,RESIGNATION.,"One point (observ'd, perhaps, by few)"
7416,RESIGNATION.,"Has often smote, and smites"
7417,RESIGNATION.,"My mind, as demonstration strong;"
7418,RESIGNATION.,That heaven in man delights:
7419,RESIGNATION.,
7420,RESIGNATION.,"What's known to man of things unseen,"
7421,RESIGNATION.,"Of future worlds, or fates?"
7422,RESIGNATION.,"So much, nor more, than what to man's"
7423,RESIGNATION.,Sublime affairs relates;
7424,RESIGNATION.,
7425,RESIGNATION.,"What's revelation then? a list,"
7426,RESIGNATION.,An inventory just
7427,RESIGNATION.,"Of that poor insect's goods, so late"
7428,RESIGNATION.,Call'd out of night and dust.
7429,RESIGNATION.,
7430,RESIGNATION.,What various motives to rejoice!
7431,RESIGNATION.,"To render joy sincere,"
7432,RESIGNATION.,Has this no weight? our joy is felt
7433,RESIGNATION.,Beyond this narrow sphere:
7434,RESIGNATION.,
7435,RESIGNATION.,"Would we in heaven new heaven create,"
7436,RESIGNATION.,And double its delight?
7437,RESIGNATION.,"A smiling world, when heaven looks down,"
7438,RESIGNATION.,How pleasing in its sight!
7439,RESIGNATION.,
7440,RESIGNATION.,Angels stoop forward from their thrones
7441,RESIGNATION.,To hear its joyful lays;
7442,RESIGNATION.,"As incense sweet enjoy, and join,"
7443,RESIGNATION.,Its aromatic praise:
7444,RESIGNATION.,
7445,RESIGNATION.,Have we no cause to fear the stroke
7446,RESIGNATION.,"Of heaven's avenging rod,"
7447,RESIGNATION.,When we presume to counteract
7448,RESIGNATION.,A sympathetic God?
7449,RESIGNATION.,
7450,RESIGNATION.,"If we resign, our patience makes"
7451,RESIGNATION.,His rod an armless wand;
7452,RESIGNATION.,"If not, it darts a serpent's sting,"
7453,RESIGNATION.,Like that in Moses' hand;
7454,RESIGNATION.,
7455,RESIGNATION.,"Like that, it swallows up whate'er"
7456,RESIGNATION.,"Earth's vain magicians bring,"
7457,RESIGNATION.,Whose baffled arts would boast below
7458,RESIGNATION.,Of joys a rival spring.
7459,RESIGNATION.,
7460,RESIGNATION.,Consummate love! the list how large
7461,RESIGNATION.,Of blessings from thy hand!
7462,RESIGNATION.,"To banish sorrow, and be blest,"
7463,RESIGNATION.,Is thy supreme command.
7464,RESIGNATION.,
7465,RESIGNATION.,Are such commands but ill obey'd?
7466,RESIGNATION.,"Of bliss, shall we complain?"
7467,RESIGNATION.,"The man, who dares to be a wretch,"
7468,RESIGNATION.,Deserves still greater pain.
7469,RESIGNATION.,
7470,RESIGNATION.,"Joy is our duty, glory, health;"
7471,RESIGNATION.,The sunshine of the soul;
7472,RESIGNATION.,Our best encomium on the power
7473,RESIGNATION.,Who sweetly plans the whole:
7474,RESIGNATION.,
7475,RESIGNATION.,Joy is our Eden still possess'd:
7476,RESIGNATION.,"Begone, ignoble grief!"
7477,RESIGNATION.,"'Tis joy makes gods, and men exalts,"
7478,RESIGNATION.,"Their nature, our relief;"
7479,RESIGNATION.,
7480,RESIGNATION.,"Relief, for man to that must stoop,"
7481,RESIGNATION.,And his due distance know;
7482,RESIGNATION.,"Transport's the language of the sides,"
7483,RESIGNATION.,Content the style below.
7484,RESIGNATION.,
7485,RESIGNATION.,"Content is joy, and joy in pain"
7486,RESIGNATION.,Is joy and virtue too;
7487,RESIGNATION.,"Thus, whilst good present we possess,"
7488,RESIGNATION.,More precious we pursue:
7489,RESIGNATION.,
7490,RESIGNATION.,"Of joy the more we have in hand,"
7491,RESIGNATION.,The more have we to come;
7492,RESIGNATION.,"Joy, like our money, interest bears,"
7493,RESIGNATION.,Which daily swells the sum.
7494,RESIGNATION.,
7495,RESIGNATION.,"""But how to smile; to stem the tide"
7496,RESIGNATION.,Of nature in our veins;
7497,RESIGNATION.,Is it not hard to weep in joy?
7498,RESIGNATION.,"What then to smile in pains?"""
7499,RESIGNATION.,
7500,RESIGNATION.,"Victorious joy! which breaks the clouds,"
7501,RESIGNATION.,And struggles through a storm;
7502,RESIGNATION.,"Proclaims the mind as great, as good"
7503,RESIGNATION.,And bids it doubly charm:
7504,RESIGNATION.,
7505,RESIGNATION.,"If doubly charming in our sex,"
7506,RESIGNATION.,"A sex, by nature, bold;"
7507,RESIGNATION.,What then in yours? 'tis diamond there
7508,RESIGNATION.,Triumphant o'er our gold.
7509,RESIGNATION.,
7510,RESIGNATION.,"And should not this complaint repress,"
7511,RESIGNATION.,And check the rising sigh?
7512,RESIGNATION.,Yet farther opiate to your pain
7513,RESIGNATION.,I labour to supply.
7514,RESIGNATION.,
7515,RESIGNATION.,Since spirits greatly damp'd distort
7516,RESIGNATION.,"Ideas of delight,"
7517,RESIGNATION.,"Look through the medium of a friend,"
7518,RESIGNATION.,To set your notions right:
7519,RESIGNATION.,
7520,RESIGNATION.,"As tears the sight, grief dims the soul;"
7521,RESIGNATION.,Its object dark appears;
7522,RESIGNATION.,"True friendship, like a rising sun,"
7523,RESIGNATION.,The soul's horizon clears.
7524,RESIGNATION.,
7525,RESIGNATION.,A friend's an optic to the mind
7526,RESIGNATION.,With sorrow clouded o'er;
7527,RESIGNATION.,And gives it strength of sight to see
7528,RESIGNATION.,Redress unseen before.
7529,RESIGNATION.,
7530,RESIGNATION.,Reason is somewhat rough in man;
7531,RESIGNATION.,"Extremely smooth and fair,"
7532,RESIGNATION.,"When she, to grace her manly strength,"
7533,RESIGNATION.,Assumes a female air:
7534,RESIGNATION.,
7535,RESIGNATION.,"A friend(51) you have, and I the same,"
7536,RESIGNATION.,"Whose prudent, soft address"
7537,RESIGNATION.,Will bring to life those healing thoughts
7538,RESIGNATION.,Which died in your distress;
7539,RESIGNATION.,
7540,RESIGNATION.,"That friend, the spirit of my theme"
7541,RESIGNATION.,"Extracting for your ease,"
7542,RESIGNATION.,"Will leave to me the dreg, in thoughts"
7543,RESIGNATION.,Too common; such as these:
7544,RESIGNATION.,
7545,RESIGNATION.,Let those lament to whom full bowls
7546,RESIGNATION.,Of sparkling joys are given;
7547,RESIGNATION.,"That triple bane inebriates life,"
7548,RESIGNATION.,"Imbitters death, and hazards heaven:"
7549,RESIGNATION.,
7550,RESIGNATION.,Woe to the soul at perfect ease!
7551,RESIGNATION.,'Tis brewing perfect pains;
7552,RESIGNATION.,"Lull'd reason sleeps, the pulse is king;"
7553,RESIGNATION.,Despotic body reigns;
7554,RESIGNATION.,
7555,RESIGNATION.,"Have you(52) ne'er pitied joy's gay scenes,"
7556,RESIGNATION.,And deem'd their glory dark?
7557,RESIGNATION.,"Alas! poor envy! she's stone-blind,"
7558,RESIGNATION.,And quite mistakes her mark:
7559,RESIGNATION.,
7560,RESIGNATION.,"Her mark lies hid in sorrow's shades,"
7561,RESIGNATION.,But sorrow well subdu'd;
7562,RESIGNATION.,And in proud fortune's frown defied
7563,RESIGNATION.,"By meek, unborrow'd good."
7564,RESIGNATION.,
7565,RESIGNATION.,By resignation; all in that
7566,RESIGNATION.,"A double friend may find,"
7567,RESIGNATION.,"A wing to heaven, and, while on earth,"
7568,RESIGNATION.,The pillow of mankind:
7569,RESIGNATION.,
7570,RESIGNATION.,"On pillows void of down, for rest"
7571,RESIGNATION.,Our restless hopes we place;
7572,RESIGNATION.,"When hopes of heaven lie warm at heart,"
7573,RESIGNATION.,Our hearts repose in peace:
7574,RESIGNATION.,
7575,RESIGNATION.,"The peace, which resignation yields,"
7576,RESIGNATION.,Who feel alone can guess;
7577,RESIGNATION.,"'Tis disbeliev'd by murmuring minds,"
7578,RESIGNATION.,They must conclude it less:
7579,RESIGNATION.,
7580,RESIGNATION.,"The loss, or gain, of that alone"
7581,RESIGNATION.,Have we to hope or fear;
7582,RESIGNATION.,"That fate controls, and can invert"
7583,RESIGNATION.,The seasons of the year:
7584,RESIGNATION.,
7585,RESIGNATION.,"O! the dark days, the year around,"
7586,RESIGNATION.,Of an impatient mind!
7587,RESIGNATION.,"Thro' clouds, and storms, a summer breaks,"
7588,RESIGNATION.,To shine on the resign'd:
7589,RESIGNATION.,
7590,RESIGNATION.,"While man by that of every grace,"
7591,RESIGNATION.,"And virtue, is possess'd;"
7592,RESIGNATION.,Foul vice her pandæmonium builds
7593,RESIGNATION.,In the rebellious breast;
7594,RESIGNATION.,
7595,RESIGNATION.,By resignation we defeat
7596,RESIGNATION.,The worst that can annoy;
7597,RESIGNATION.,"And suffer, with far more repose,"
7598,RESIGNATION.,Than worldlings can enjoy.
7599,RESIGNATION.,
7600,RESIGNATION.,From small experience this I speak;
7601,RESIGNATION.,O! grant to those I love
7602,RESIGNATION.,"Experience fuller far, ye powers,"
7603,RESIGNATION.,Who form our fates above!
7604,RESIGNATION.,
7605,RESIGNATION.,"My love were due, if not to those"
7606,RESIGNATION.,"Who, leaving grandeur, came"
7607,RESIGNATION.,"To shine on age in mean recess,"
7608,RESIGNATION.,And light me to my theme!
7609,RESIGNATION.,
7610,RESIGNATION.,"A theme themselves! A theme, how rare!"
7611,RESIGNATION.,"The charms, which they display,"
7612,RESIGNATION.,"To triumph over captive heads,"
7613,RESIGNATION.,Are set in bright array:
7614,RESIGNATION.,
7615,RESIGNATION.,"With his own arms proud man's o'ercome,"
7616,RESIGNATION.,His boasted laurels die:
7617,RESIGNATION.,"Learning and genius, wiser grown,"
7618,RESIGNATION.,To female bosoms fly.
7619,RESIGNATION.,
7620,RESIGNATION.,"This revolution, fix'd by fate,"
7621,RESIGNATION.,In fable was foretold;
7622,RESIGNATION.,"The dark prediction puzzled wits,"
7623,RESIGNATION.,Nor could the learn'd unfold:
7624,RESIGNATION.,
7625,RESIGNATION.,"But as those ladies'(53) works I read,"
7626,RESIGNATION.,"They darted such a ray,"
7627,RESIGNATION.,"The latent sense burst out at once,"
7628,RESIGNATION.,And shone in open day:
7629,RESIGNATION.,
7630,RESIGNATION.,"So burst, full ripe, distended fruits,"
7631,RESIGNATION.,When strongly strikes the sun;
7632,RESIGNATION.,And from the purple grape unpress'd
7633,RESIGNATION.,Spontaneous nectars run.
7634,RESIGNATION.,
7635,RESIGNATION.,"Pallas, ('tis said,) when Jove grew dull,"
7636,RESIGNATION.,Forsook his drowsy brain;
7637,RESIGNATION.,And sprightly leap'd into the throne
7638,RESIGNATION.,Of wisdom's brighter reign;
7639,RESIGNATION.,
7640,RESIGNATION.,"Her helmet took; that is, shot rays"
7641,RESIGNATION.,Of formidable wit;
7642,RESIGNATION.,"And lance,--or, genius most acute,"
7643,RESIGNATION.,Which lines immortal writ;
7644,RESIGNATION.,
7645,RESIGNATION.,"And gorgon shield,--or, power to fright"
7646,RESIGNATION.,"Man's folly, dreadful shone,"
7647,RESIGNATION.,And many a blockhead (easy change!)
7648,RESIGNATION.,"Turn'd, instantly, to stone."
7649,RESIGNATION.,
7650,RESIGNATION.,"Our authors male, as, then, did Jove,"
7651,RESIGNATION.,"Now scratch a damag'd head,"
7652,RESIGNATION.,"And call for what once quarter'd there,"

7655,RESIGNATION.,"The fruit of knowledge, golden fruit!"
7656,RESIGNATION.,"That once forbidden tree,"
7657,RESIGNATION.,"Hedg'd-in by surly man, is now"
7658,RESIGNATION.,To Britain's daughters free:
7659,RESIGNATION.,
7660,RESIGNATION.,In Eve (we know) of fruit so fair
7661,RESIGNATION.,The noble thirst began;
7662,RESIGNATION.,"And they, like her, have caus'd a fall,"
7663,RESIGNATION.,A fall of fame in man:
7664,RESIGNATION.,
7665,RESIGNATION.,"And since of genius in our sex,"
7666,RESIGNATION.,O Addison! with thee
7667,RESIGNATION.,The sun is set; how I rejoice
7668,RESIGNATION.,This sister lamp to see!
7669,RESIGNATION.,
7670,RESIGNATION.,"It sheds, like Cynthia, silver beams"
7671,RESIGNATION.,On man's nocturnal state;
7672,RESIGNATION.,"His lessen'd light, and languid powers,"
7673,RESIGNATION.,"I show, whilst I relate."
7674,RESIGNATION.,

7695,RESIGNATION.,
7696,RESIGNATION.,"What numbers, rushing down the steep"

7698,RESIGNATION.,Have perish'd in their ardent wish!
7699,RESIGNATION.,"Wish ardent, ever wrong!"
7700,RESIGNATION.,
7701,RESIGNATION.,"'Tis resignation's full reverse,"
7702,RESIGNATION.,"Most wrong, as it implies"
7703,RESIGNATION.,"Error most fatal in our choice,"

7748,RESIGNATION.,Far nobler! if his fate sustain'd
7749,RESIGNATION.,And left to heaven the rest;
7750,RESIGNATION.,
7751,RESIGNATION.,"Then he the palm had borne away,"
7752,RESIGNATION.,At distance Cæsar thrown;
7753,RESIGNATION.,"Put him off cheaply with the world,"
7754,RESIGNATION.,And made the skies his own.
7755,RESIGNATION.,
7756,RESIGNATION.,What cannot resignation do?
7757,RESIGNATION.,It wonders can perform;
7758,RESIGNATION.,"That powerful charm, ""Thy will be done,"""
7759,RESIGNATION.,Can lay the loudest storm.
7760,RESIGNATION.,
7761,RESIGNATION.,"Come, resignation! then, from fields,"
7762,RESIGNATION.,"Where, mounted on the wing,"
7763,RESIGNATION.,"A wing of flame, blest martyrs' souls"
7764,RESIGNATION.,Ascended to their king.
7765,RESIGNATION.,
7766,RESIGNATION.,Who is it calls thee? one whose need
7767,RESIGNATION.,Transcends the common size;
7768,RESIGNATION.,Who stands in front against a foe
7769,RESIGNATION.,To which no equal rise:
7770,RESIGNATION.,
7771,RESIGNATION.,"In front he stands, the brink he treads"
7772,RESIGNATION.,Of an eternal state;
7773,RESIGNATION.,How dreadful his appointed post!
7774,RESIGNATION.,How strongly arm'd by fate:
7775,RESIGNATION.,
7776,RESIGNATION.,His threatening foe! what shadows deep
7777,RESIGNATION.,O'erwhelm his gloomy brow!
7778,RESIGNATION.,His dart tremendous!----at fourscore
7779,RESIGNATION.,"My sole asylum, thou!"
7780,RESIGNATION.,
7781,RESIGNATION.,"Haste, then, O resignation! haste,"
7782,RESIGNATION.,'Tis thine to reconcile
7783,RESIGNATION.,"My foe, and me; at thy approach"
7784,RESIGNATION.,My foe begins to smile:
7785,RESIGNATION.,
7786,RESIGNATION.,"O! for that summit of my wish,"
7787,RESIGNATION.,"Whilst here I draw my breath,"
7788,RESIGNATION.,"That promise of eternal life,"
7789,RESIGNATION.,A glorious smile in death:
7790,RESIGNATION.,
7791,RESIGNATION.,"What sight, heaven's azure arch beneath,"
7792,RESIGNATION.,Has most of heaven to boast?
7793,RESIGNATION.,"The man resign'd; at once serene,"
7794,RESIGNATION.,And giving up the ghost.
7795,RESIGNATION.,
7796,RESIGNATION.,"At death's arrival they shall smile,"
7797,RESIGNATION.,"Who, not in life o'er gay,"
7798,RESIGNATION.,Serious and frequent thought send out
7799,RESIGNATION.,To meet him on his way:
7800,RESIGNATION.,
7801,RESIGNATION.,My gay coevals! (such there are)
7802,RESIGNATION.,If happiness is dear;
7803,RESIGNATION.,Approaching death's alarming day
7804,RESIGNATION.,Discreetly let us fear:
7805,RESIGNATION.,
7806,RESIGNATION.,"The fear of death is truly wise,"
7807,RESIGNATION.,Till wisdom can rise higher;
7808,RESIGNATION.,"And, arm'd with pious fortitude,"
7809,RESIGNATION.,"Death dreaded once, desire:"
7810,RESIGNATION.,
7811,RESIGNATION.,Grand climacteric vanities
7812,RESIGNATION.,The vainest will despise;
7813,RESIGNATION.,"Shock'd, when beneath the snow of age"
7814,RESIGNATION.,Man immaturely dies:
7815,RESIGNATION.,
7816,RESIGNATION.,But am not I myself the man?
7817,RESIGNATION.,No need abroad to roam
7818,RESIGNATION.,In quest of faults to be chastis'd;
7819,RESIGNATION.,What cause to blush at home?
7820,RESIGNATION.,
7821,RESIGNATION.,"In life's decline, when men relapse"
7822,RESIGNATION.,"Into the sports of youth,"
7823,RESIGNATION.,"The second child out-fools the first,"
7824,RESIGNATION.,And tempts the lash of truth;
7825,RESIGNATION.,
7826,RESIGNATION.,Shall a mere truant from the grave
7827,RESIGNATION.,With rival boys engage?
7828,RESIGNATION.,"His trembling voice attempt to sing,"
7829,RESIGNATION.,And ape the poet's rage?
7830,RESIGNATION.,
7831,RESIGNATION.,"Here, madam! let me visit one,"
7832,RESIGNATION.,"My fault who, partly, shares,"
7833,RESIGNATION.,"And tell myself, by telling him,"
7834,RESIGNATION.,What more becomes our years;
7835,RESIGNATION.,
7836,RESIGNATION.,And if your breast with prudent zeal
7837,RESIGNATION.,"For resignation glows,"
7838,RESIGNATION.,You will not disapprove a just
7839,RESIGNATION.,Resentment at its foes.
7840,RESIGNATION.,
7841,RESIGNATION.,"In youth, Voltaire! our foibles plead"
7842,RESIGNATION.,For some indulgence due;
7843,RESIGNATION.,"When heads are white, their thoughts and aims"
7844,RESIGNATION.,Should change their colour too:
7845,RESIGNATION.,
7846,RESIGNATION.,How are you cheated by your wit!
7847,RESIGNATION.,"Old age is bound to pay,"
7848,RESIGNATION.,"By nature's law, a mind discreet,"
7849,RESIGNATION.,For joys it takes away;
7850,RESIGNATION.,
7851,RESIGNATION.,"A mighty change is wrought by years,"
7852,RESIGNATION.,Reversing human lot;
7853,RESIGNATION.,"In age 'tis honour to lie hid,"
7854,RESIGNATION.,'Tis praise to be forgot;
7855,RESIGNATION.,
7856,RESIGNATION.,"The wise, as flowers, which spread at noon,"
7857,RESIGNATION.,"And all their charms expose,"
7858,RESIGNATION.,"When evening damps and shades descend,"
7859,RESIGNATION.,Their evolutions close.
7860,RESIGNATION.,
7861,RESIGNATION.,"What though your muse has nobly soar'd,"
7862,RESIGNATION.,Is that our truth sublime?
7863,RESIGNATION.,"Ours, hoary friend! is to prefer"
7864,RESIGNATION.,Eternity to time:
7865,RESIGNATION.,
7866,RESIGNATION.,Why close a life so justly fam'd
7867,RESIGNATION.,With such bold trash as this?(54)
7868,RESIGNATION.,"This for renown? yes, such as makes"
7869,RESIGNATION.,Obscurity a bliss:
7870,RESIGNATION.,
7871,RESIGNATION.,"Your trash, with mine, at open war,"
7872,RESIGNATION.,"Is obstinately bent,(55)"
7873,RESIGNATION.,"Like wits below, to sow your tares"
7874,RESIGNATION.,Of gloom and discontent:
7875,RESIGNATION.,
7876,RESIGNATION.,"With so much sunshine at command,"
7877,RESIGNATION.,Why light with darkness mix?
7878,RESIGNATION.,Why dash with pain our pleasure?
7879,RESIGNATION.,Your Helicon with Styx?
7880,RESIGNATION.,
7881,RESIGNATION.,Your works in our divided minds
7882,RESIGNATION.,"Repugnant passions raise,"
7883,RESIGNATION.,"Confound us with a double stroke,"
7884,RESIGNATION.,We shudder whilst we praise;
7885,RESIGNATION.,
7886,RESIGNATION.,"A curious web, as finely wrought"
7887,RESIGNATION.,"As genius can inspire,"
7888,RESIGNATION.,"From a black bag of poison spun,"
7889,RESIGNATION.,With horror we admire.
7890,RESIGNATION.,
7891,RESIGNATION.,"Mean as it is, if this is read"
7892,RESIGNATION.,"With a disdainful air,"
7893,RESIGNATION.,I can't forgive so great a foe
7894,RESIGNATION.,To my dear friend Voltaire:
7895,RESIGNATION.,
7896,RESIGNATION.,"Early I knew him, early prais'd,"
7897,RESIGNATION.,And long to praise him late;
7898,RESIGNATION.,"His genius greatly I admire,"
7899,RESIGNATION.,Nor would deplore his fate;
7900,RESIGNATION.,
7901,RESIGNATION.,A fate how much to be deplor'd!
7902,RESIGNATION.,At which our nature starts;
7903,RESIGNATION.,Forbear to fall on your own sword.
7904,RESIGNATION.,To perish by your parts:
7905,RESIGNATION.,
7906,RESIGNATION.,"""But great your name""--To feed on air,"
7907,RESIGNATION.,Were then immortals born?
7908,RESIGNATION.,"Nothing is great, of which more great,"
7909,RESIGNATION.,More glorious is the scorn.
7910,RESIGNATION.,
7911,RESIGNATION.,Can fame your carcass from the worm
7912,RESIGNATION.,"Which gnaws us in the grave,"
7913,RESIGNATION.,"Or soul from that which never dies,"
7914,RESIGNATION.,Applauding Europe save?
7915,RESIGNATION.,
7916,RESIGNATION.,But fame you lose; good sense alone
7917,RESIGNATION.,"Your idol, praise, can claim;"
7918,RESIGNATION.,"When wild wit murders happiness,"
7919,RESIGNATION.,It puts to death our fame!
7920,RESIGNATION.,
7921,RESIGNATION.,"Nor boast your genius, talents bright;"
7922,RESIGNATION.,"E'en dunces will despise,"
7923,RESIGNATION.,If in your western beams is miss'd
7924,RESIGNATION.,A genius for the skies;
7925,RESIGNATION.,
7926,RESIGNATION.,Your taste too fails; what most excels
7927,RESIGNATION.,True taste must relish most!
7928,RESIGNATION.,"And what, to rival palms above,"
7929,RESIGNATION.,Can proudest laurels boast?
7930,RESIGNATION.,
7931,RESIGNATION.,"Sound heads salvation's helmet seek,(56)"
7932,RESIGNATION.,"Resplendent are its rays,"
7933,RESIGNATION.,"Let that suffice; it needs no plume,"
7934,RESIGNATION.,Of sublunary praise.
7935,RESIGNATION.,
7936,RESIGNATION.,May this enable couch'd Voltaire
7937,RESIGNATION.,"To see that--""All is right,""(57)"
7938,RESIGNATION.,"His eye, by flash of wit struck blind,"
7939,RESIGNATION.,Restoring to its sight;
7940,RESIGNATION.,
7941,RESIGNATION.,"If so, all's well: who much have err'd,"
7942,RESIGNATION.,That much have been forgiven;
7943,RESIGNATION.,"I speak with joy, with joy he'll hear,"
7944,RESIGNATION.,"""Voltaires are, now, in heaven."""
7945,RESIGNATION.,
7946,RESIGNATION.,"Nay, such philanthropy divine,"
7947,RESIGNATION.,"So boundless in degree,"
7948,RESIGNATION.,Its marvellous of love extends
7949,RESIGNATION.,(Stoops most profound!) to me:
7950,RESIGNATION.,
7951,RESIGNATION.,"Let others cruel stars arraign,"
7952,RESIGNATION.,Or dwell on their distress;
7953,RESIGNATION.,"But let my page, for mercies pour'd,"
7954,RESIGNATION.,A grateful heart express:
7955,RESIGNATION.,
7956,RESIGNATION.,"Walking, the present God was seen,"
7957,RESIGNATION.,"Of old, in Eden fair;"
7958,RESIGNATION.,"The God as present, by plain steps"
7959,RESIGNATION.,"Of providential care,"
7960,RESIGNATION.,
7961,RESIGNATION.,I behold passing through my life;
7962,RESIGNATION.,His awful voice I hear;
7963,RESIGNATION.,"And, conscious of my nakedness,"
7964,RESIGNATION.,Would hide myself for fear:
7965,RESIGNATION.,
7966,RESIGNATION.,"But where the trees, or where the clouds,"
7967,RESIGNATION.,Can cover from his sight?
7968,RESIGNATION.,"Naked the centre to that eye,"
7969,RESIGNATION.,To which the sun is night.
7970,RESIGNATION.,
7971,RESIGNATION.,As yonder glittering lamps on high
7972,RESIGNATION.,Through night illumin'd roll;
7973,RESIGNATION.,"My thoughts of him, by whom they shine,"
7974,RESIGNATION.,Chase darkness from my soul;
7975,RESIGNATION.,
7976,RESIGNATION.,"My soul, which reads his hand as clear"
7977,RESIGNATION.,"In my minute affairs,"
7978,RESIGNATION.,As in his ample manuscript
7979,RESIGNATION.,"Of sun, and moon, and stars;"
7980,RESIGNATION.,
7981,RESIGNATION.,And knows him not more bent aright
7982,RESIGNATION.,"To wield that vast machine,"
7983,RESIGNATION.,Than to correct one erring thought
7984,RESIGNATION.,In my small world within;
7985,RESIGNATION.,
7986,RESIGNATION.,"A world, that shall survive the fall"
7987,RESIGNATION.,Of all his wonders here;
7988,RESIGNATION.,"Survive, when suns ten thousand drop,"
7989,RESIGNATION.,And leave a darken'd sphere.
7990,RESIGNATION.,
7991,RESIGNATION.,"Yon matter gross, how bright it shines!"
7992,RESIGNATION.,For time how great his care!
7993,RESIGNATION.,Sure spirit and eternity
7994,RESIGNATION.,Far richer glories share;
7995,RESIGNATION.,
7996,RESIGNATION.,"Let those our hearts impress, on those"
7997,RESIGNATION.,Our contemplation dwell;
7998,RESIGNATION.,"On those my thoughts how justly thrown,"
7999,RESIGNATION.,By what I now shall tell:
8000,RESIGNATION.,
8001,RESIGNATION.,When backward with attentive mind
8002,RESIGNATION.,"Life's labyrinth I trace,"
8003,RESIGNATION.,I find him far myself beyond
8004,RESIGNATION.,Propitious to my peace:
8005,RESIGNATION.,
8006,RESIGNATION.,"Through all the crooked paths I trod,"
8007,RESIGNATION.,My folly he pursued;
8008,RESIGNATION.,My heart astray to quick return
8009,RESIGNATION.,Importunately woo'd;
8010,RESIGNATION.,
8011,RESIGNATION.,Due resignation home to press
8012,RESIGNATION.,"On my capricious will,"
8013,RESIGNATION.,"How many rescues did I meet,"
8014,RESIGNATION.,Beneath the mask of ill!
8015,RESIGNATION.,
8016,RESIGNATION.,How many foes in ambush laid
8017,RESIGNATION.,Beneath my soul's desire!
8018,RESIGNATION.,The deepest penitents are made
8019,RESIGNATION.,By what we most admire.
8020,RESIGNATION.,
8021,RESIGNATION.,Have I not sometimes (real good
8022,RESIGNATION.,So little mortals know!)
8023,RESIGNATION.,"Mounting the summit of my wish,"
8024,RESIGNATION.,Profoundly plung'd in woe?
8025,RESIGNATION.,
8026,RESIGNATION.,"I rarely plann'd, but cause I found"
8027,RESIGNATION.,My plan's defeat to bless:
8028,RESIGNATION.,Oft I lamented an event;
8029,RESIGNATION.,It turn'd to my success.
8030,RESIGNATION.,
8031,RESIGNATION.,By sharpen'd appetite to give
8032,RESIGNATION.,"To good intense delight,"
8033,RESIGNATION.,Through dark and deep perplexities
8034,RESIGNATION.,He led me to the right.
8035,RESIGNATION.,
8036,RESIGNATION.,"And is not this the gloomy path,"
8037,RESIGNATION.,Which you are treading now?
8038,RESIGNATION.,"The path most gloomy leads to light,"
8039,RESIGNATION.,When our proud passions bow:
8040,RESIGNATION.,
8041,RESIGNATION.,"When labouring under fancied ill,"
8042,RESIGNATION.,"My spirits to sustain,"
8043,RESIGNATION.,He kindly cur'd with sovereign draughts
8044,RESIGNATION.,Of unimagin'd pain.
8045,RESIGNATION.,
8046,RESIGNATION.,Pain'd sense from fancied tyranny
8047,RESIGNATION.,Alone can set us free;
8048,RESIGNATION.,"A thousand miseries we feel,"
8049,RESIGNATION.,Till sunk in misery.
8050,RESIGNATION.,
8051,RESIGNATION.,"Cloy'd with a glut of all we wish,"
8052,RESIGNATION.,Our wish we relish less;
8053,RESIGNATION.,"Success, a sort of suicide,"
8054,RESIGNATION.,Is ruin'd by success:
8055,RESIGNATION.,
8056,RESIGNATION.,"Sometimes he led me near to death,"
8057,RESIGNATION.,"And, pointing to the grave,"
8058,RESIGNATION.,Bid terror whisper kind advice;
8059,RESIGNATION.,And taught the tomb to save:
8060,RESIGNATION.,
8061,RESIGNATION.,To raise my thoughts beyond where worlds
8062,RESIGNATION.,"As spangles o'er us shine,"
8063,RESIGNATION.,"One day he gave, and bid the next"
8064,RESIGNATION.,My soul's delight resign.
8065,RESIGNATION.,
8066,RESIGNATION.,"We to ourselves, but through the means"
8067,RESIGNATION.,"Of mirrors, are unknown;"
8068,RESIGNATION.,In this my fate can you descry
8069,RESIGNATION.,No features of your own?
8070,RESIGNATION.,
8071,RESIGNATION.,"And if you can, let that excuse"
8072,RESIGNATION.,These self-recording lines;
8073,RESIGNATION.,"A record, modesty forbids,"
8074,RESIGNATION.,Or to small bound confines:
8075,RESIGNATION.,
8076,RESIGNATION.,In grief why deep ingulf'd? You see
8077,RESIGNATION.,You suffer nothing rare;
8078,RESIGNATION.,Uncommon grief for common fate!
8079,RESIGNATION.,That wisdom cannot bear.
8080,RESIGNATION.,
8081,RESIGNATION.,"When streams flow backward to their source,"
8082,RESIGNATION.,"And humbled flames descend,"
8083,RESIGNATION.,"And mountains wing'd shall fly aloft,"
8084,RESIGNATION.,Then human sorrows end;
8085,RESIGNATION.,
8086,RESIGNATION.,"But human prudence too must cease,"
8087,RESIGNATION.,"When sorrows domineer,"
8088,RESIGNATION.,"When fortitude has lost its fire,"
8089,RESIGNATION.,And freezes into fear:
8090,RESIGNATION.,
8091,RESIGNATION.,The pang most poignant of my life
8092,RESIGNATION.,Now heightens my delight;
8093,RESIGNATION.,I see a fair creation rise
8094,RESIGNATION.,"From chaos, and old night:"
8095,RESIGNATION.,
8096,RESIGNATION.,"From what seem'd horror, and despair,"
8097,RESIGNATION.,The richest harvest rose;
8098,RESIGNATION.,And gave me in the nod divine
8099,RESIGNATION.,An absolute repose.
8100,RESIGNATION.,
8101,RESIGNATION.,"Of all the plunders of mankind,"
8102,RESIGNATION.,"More gross, or frequent, none,"
8103,RESIGNATION.,"Than in their grief and joy misplac'd,"
8104,RESIGNATION.,Eternally are shown.
8105,RESIGNATION.,
8106,RESIGNATION.,But whither points all this parade?
8107,RESIGNATION.,"It says, that near you lies"
8108,RESIGNATION.,"A book, perhaps yet unperus'd,"
8109,RESIGNATION.,Which you should greatly prize:
8110,RESIGNATION.,
8111,RESIGNATION.,"Of self-perusal, science rare!"
8112,RESIGNATION.,Few know the mighty gain;
8113,RESIGNATION.,"Learn'd prelates, self-unread, may read"
8114,RESIGNATION.,Their Bibles o'er in vain:
8115,RESIGNATION.,
8116,RESIGNATION.,"Self-knowledge, which from heaven itself"
8117,RESIGNATION.,"(So sages tell us) came,"
8118,RESIGNATION.,"What is it, but a daughter fair"
8119,RESIGNATION.,Of my maternal theme?
8120,RESIGNATION.,
8121,RESIGNATION.,Unletter'd and untravel'd men
8122,RESIGNATION.,"An oracle might find,"
8123,RESIGNATION.,"Would they consult their own contents,"
8124,RESIGNATION.,The Delphos of the mind.
8125,RESIGNATION.,
8126,RESIGNATION.,Enter your bosom; there you'll meet
8127,RESIGNATION.,"A revelation new,"
8128,RESIGNATION.,A revelation personal;
8129,RESIGNATION.,Which none can read but you.
8130,RESIGNATION.,
8131,RESIGNATION.,There will you clearly read reveal'd
8132,RESIGNATION.,"In your enlighten'd thought,"
8133,RESIGNATION.,"By mercies manifold, through life,"
8134,RESIGNATION.,"To fresh remembrance brought,"
8135,RESIGNATION.,
8136,RESIGNATION.,A mighty Being! and in him
8137,RESIGNATION.,"A complicated friend,"
8138,RESIGNATION.,"A father, brother, spouse; no dread"
8139,RESIGNATION.,"Of death, divorce, or end:"
8140,RESIGNATION.,
8141,RESIGNATION.,"Who such a matchless friend embrace,"
8142,RESIGNATION.,"And lodge him in their heart,"
8143,RESIGNATION.,"Full well, from agonies exempt,"
8144,RESIGNATION.,With other friends may part:
8145,RESIGNATION.,
8146,RESIGNATION.,As when o'erloaded branches bear
8147,RESIGNATION.,"Large clusters big with wine,"
8148,RESIGNATION.,We scarce regret one falling leaf
8149,RESIGNATION.,From the luxuriant vine.
8150,RESIGNATION.,
8151,RESIGNATION.,My short advice to you may sound
8152,RESIGNATION.,"Obscure or somewhat odd,"
8153,RESIGNATION.,"Though 'tis the best that man can give,--"
8154,RESIGNATION.,"""E'en be content with God."""
8155,RESIGNATION.,
8156,RESIGNATION.,"Through love he gave you the deceas'd,"
8157,RESIGNATION.,Through greater took him hence;
8158,RESIGNATION.,"This reason fully could evince,"
8159,RESIGNATION.,Though murmur'd at by sense.
8160,RESIGNATION.,
8161,RESIGNATION.,"This friend, far past the kindest kind,"
8162,RESIGNATION.,Is past the greatest great;
8163,RESIGNATION.,His greatness let me touch in points
8164,RESIGNATION.,Not foreign to your state;
8165,RESIGNATION.,
8166,RESIGNATION.,"His eye, this instant, reads your heart;"
8167,RESIGNATION.,A truth less obvious hear;
8168,RESIGNATION.,This instant its most secret thoughts
8169,RESIGNATION.,Are sounding in his ear:
8170,RESIGNATION.,
8171,RESIGNATION.,"Dispute you this? O! stand in awe,"
8172,RESIGNATION.,"And cease your sorrow; know,"
8173,RESIGNATION.,"That tears now trickling down, he saw"
8174,RESIGNATION.,Ten thousand years ago;
8175,RESIGNATION.,
8176,RESIGNATION.,"And twice ten thousand hence, if you"
8177,RESIGNATION.,Your temper reconcile
8178,RESIGNATION.,"To reason's bound, will he behold"
8179,RESIGNATION.,Your prudence with a smile;
8180,RESIGNATION.,
8181,RESIGNATION.,"A smile, which through eternity"
8182,RESIGNATION.,"Diffuses so bright rays,"
8183,RESIGNATION.,"The dimmest deifies e'en guilt,"
8184,RESIGNATION.,"If guilt, at last, obeys:"
8185,RESIGNATION.,
8186,RESIGNATION.,Your guilt (for guilt it is to mourn
8187,RESIGNATION.,"When such a sovereign reigns),"
8188,RESIGNATION.,Your guilt diminish; peace pursue;
8189,RESIGNATION.,How glorious peace in pains!
8190,RESIGNATION.,
8191,RESIGNATION.,"Here, then, your sorrows cease; if not,"
8192,RESIGNATION.,"Think how unhappy they,"
8193,RESIGNATION.,"Who guilt increase by streaming tears,"
8194,RESIGNATION.,Which guilt should wash away;
8195,RESIGNATION.,
8196,RESIGNATION.,Of tears that gush profuse restrain;
8197,RESIGNATION.,Whence burst those dismal sighs?
8198,RESIGNATION.,They from the throbbing breast of one
8199,RESIGNATION.,(Strange truth!) most happy rise;
8200,RESIGNATION.,
8201,RESIGNATION.,"Not angels (hear it, and exult!)"
8202,RESIGNATION.,Enjoy a larger share
8203,RESIGNATION.,"Than is indulg'd to you, and yours,"
8204,RESIGNATION.,Of God's impartial care;
8205,RESIGNATION.,
8206,RESIGNATION.,"Anxious for each, as if on each"
8207,RESIGNATION.,His care for all was thrown;
8208,RESIGNATION.,"For all his care as absolute,"
8209,RESIGNATION.,As all had been but one.
8210,RESIGNATION.,
8211,RESIGNATION.,And is he then so near! so kind!--
8212,RESIGNATION.,"How little then, and great,"
8213,RESIGNATION.,"That riddle, man! O! let me gaze"
8214,RESIGNATION.,At wonders in his fate;
8215,RESIGNATION.,
8216,RESIGNATION.,"His fate, who yesterday did crawl"
8217,RESIGNATION.,"A worm from darkness deep,"
8218,RESIGNATION.,"And shall, with brother worms, beneath"
8219,RESIGNATION.,"A turf, to-morrow sleep;"
8220,RESIGNATION.,
8221,RESIGNATION.,"How mean!--And yet, if well obey'd"
8222,RESIGNATION.,"His mighty Master's call,"
8223,RESIGNATION.,The whole creation for mean man
8224,RESIGNATION.,Is deem'd a boon too small:
8225,RESIGNATION.,
8226,RESIGNATION.,Too small the whole creation deem'd
8227,RESIGNATION.,For emmets in the dust!
8228,RESIGNATION.,Account amazing! yet most true;
8229,RESIGNATION.,"My song is bold, yet just:"
8230,RESIGNATION.,
8231,RESIGNATION.,"Man born for infinite, in whom"
8232,RESIGNATION.,Nor period can destroy
8233,RESIGNATION.,"The power, in exquisite extremes,"
8234,RESIGNATION.,"To suffer, or enjoy;"
8235,RESIGNATION.,
8236,RESIGNATION.,Give him earth's empire (if no more)
8237,RESIGNATION.,"He's beggar'd, and undone!"
8238,RESIGNATION.,Imprison'd in unbounded space!
8239,RESIGNATION.,Benighted by the sun!
8240,RESIGNATION.,
8241,RESIGNATION.,For what the sun's meridian blaze
8242,RESIGNATION.,To the most feeble ray
8243,RESIGNATION.,Which glimmers from the distant dawn
8244,RESIGNATION.,Of uncreated day?
8245,RESIGNATION.,
8246,RESIGNATION.,'Tis not the poet's rapture feign'd
8247,RESIGNATION.,Swells here the vain to please;
8248,RESIGNATION.,The mind most sober kindles most
8249,RESIGNATION.,At truths sublime as these;
8250,RESIGNATION.,
8251,RESIGNATION.,"They warm e'en me.--I dare not say,"
8252,RESIGNATION.,Divine ambition strove
8253,RESIGNATION.,"Not to bless only, but confound,"
8254,RESIGNATION.,"Nay, fright us with its love;"
8255,RESIGNATION.,
8256,RESIGNATION.,"And yet so frightful what, or kind,"
8257,RESIGNATION.,"As that the rending rock,"
8258,RESIGNATION.,"The darken'd sun, and rising dead,"
8259,RESIGNATION.,So formidable spoke?
8260,RESIGNATION.,
8261,RESIGNATION.,And are we darker than that sun?
8262,RESIGNATION.,"Than rocks more hard, and blind?"
8263,RESIGNATION.,We are;--if not to such a God
8264,RESIGNATION.,In agonies resigned.
8265,RESIGNATION.,
8266,RESIGNATION.,"Yes, e'en in agonies forbear"
8267,RESIGNATION.,To doubt almighty love;
8268,RESIGNATION.,"Whate'er endears eternity,"
8269,RESIGNATION.,Is mercy from above;
8270,RESIGNATION.,
8271,RESIGNATION.,"What most imbitters time, that most"
8272,RESIGNATION.,"Eternity endears,"
8273,RESIGNATION.,"And thus, by plunging in distress,"
8274,RESIGNATION.,Exalts us to the spheres;
8275,RESIGNATION.,
8276,RESIGNATION.,"Joy's fountain head! where bliss o'er bliss,"
8277,RESIGNATION.,"O'er wonders wonders rise,"
8278,RESIGNATION.,And an Omnipotence prepares
8279,RESIGNATION.,Its banquet for the wise:
8280,RESIGNATION.,
8281,RESIGNATION.,Ambrosial banquet! rich in wines
8282,RESIGNATION.,Nectareous to the soul!
8283,RESIGNATION.,"What transports sparkle from the stream,"
8284,RESIGNATION.,As angels fill the bowl!
8285,RESIGNATION.,
8286,RESIGNATION.,Fountain profuse of every bliss!
8287,RESIGNATION.,Good-will immense prevails;
8288,RESIGNATION.,Man's line can't fathom its profound
8289,RESIGNATION.,An angel's plummet fails.
8290,RESIGNATION.,
8291,RESIGNATION.,"Thy love and might, by what they know,"
8292,RESIGNATION.,"Who judge, nor dream of more;"
8293,RESIGNATION.,"They ask a drop, how deep the sea!"
8294,RESIGNATION.,"One sand, how wide the shore!"
8295,RESIGNATION.,
8296,RESIGNATION.,"Of thy exuberant good-will,"
8297,RESIGNATION.,Offended Deity!
8298,RESIGNATION.,"The thousandth part who comprehends,"
8299,RESIGNATION.,A deity is he.
8300,RESIGNATION.,
8301,RESIGNATION.,How yonder ample azure field
8302,RESIGNATION.,With radiant worlds is sown!
8303,RESIGNATION.,How tubes astonish us with those
8304,RESIGNATION.,More deep in ether thrown!
8305,RESIGNATION.,
8306,RESIGNATION.,And those beyond of brighter worlds
8307,RESIGNATION.,Why not a million more?--
8308,RESIGNATION.,"In lieu of answer, let us all"
8309,RESIGNATION.,"Fall prostrate, and adore."
8310,RESIGNATION.,
8311,RESIGNATION.,"Since thou art infinite in power,"
8312,RESIGNATION.,Nor thy indulgence less;
8313,RESIGNATION.,"Since man, quite impotent and blind,"
8314,RESIGNATION.,Oft drops into distress;
8315,RESIGNATION.,
8316,RESIGNATION.,"Say, what is resignation? 'T is"
8317,RESIGNATION.,Man's weakness understood;
8318,RESIGNATION.,"And wisdom grasping, with a hand"
8319,RESIGNATION.,"Far stronger, every good."
8320,RESIGNATION.,
8321,RESIGNATION.,"Let rash repiners stand appall'd,"
8322,RESIGNATION.,In thee who dare not trust;
8323,RESIGNATION.,"Whose abject souls, like demons dark,"
8324,RESIGNATION.,Are murmuring in the dust;
8325,RESIGNATION.,
8326,RESIGNATION.,"For man to murmur, or repine"
8327,RESIGNATION.,"At what by thee is done,"
8328,RESIGNATION.,"No less absurd, than to complain"
8329,RESIGNATION.,Of darkness in the sun.
8330,RESIGNATION.,
8331,RESIGNATION.,"Who would not, with a heart at ease,"
8332,RESIGNATION.,"Bright eye, unclouded brow,"
8333,RESIGNATION.,"Wisdom and goodness at the helm,"
8334,RESIGNATION.,The roughest ocean plough?
8335,RESIGNATION.,
8336,RESIGNATION.,"What, though I'm swallow'd in the deep?"
8337,RESIGNATION.,Though mountains o'er me roar?
8338,RESIGNATION.,"Jehovah reigns! as Jonah safe,"
8339,RESIGNATION.,"I'm landed, and adore:"
8340,RESIGNATION.,
8341,RESIGNATION.,"Thy will is welcome, let it wear"
8342,RESIGNATION.,Its most tremendous form;
8343,RESIGNATION.,"Roar, waves; rage, winds! I know that thou"
8344,RESIGNATION.,Canst save me by a storm.
8345,RESIGNATION.,
8346,RESIGNATION.,"From the immortal spirits born,"
8347,RESIGNATION.,"To thee, their fountain, flow,"
8348,RESIGNATION.,If wise; as curl'd around to theirs
8349,RESIGNATION.,Meandering streams below:
8350,RESIGNATION.,
8351,RESIGNATION.,"Not less compell'd by reason's call,"
8352,RESIGNATION.,"To thee our souls aspire,"
8353,RESIGNATION.,"Than to thy skies, by nature's law,"
8354,RESIGNATION.,High mounts material fire;
8355,RESIGNATION.,
8356,RESIGNATION.,"To thee aspiring they exult,"
8357,RESIGNATION.,"I feel my spirits rise,"
8358,RESIGNATION.,"I feel myself thy son, and pant"
8359,RESIGNATION.,For patrimonial skies;
8360,RESIGNATION.,
8361,RESIGNATION.,"Since ardent thirst of future good,"
8362,RESIGNATION.,"And generous sense of past,"
8363,RESIGNATION.,"To thee man's prudence strongly ties,"
8364,RESIGNATION.,And binds affection fast;
8365,RESIGNATION.,
8366,RESIGNATION.,"Since great thy love, and great our want,"
8367,RESIGNATION.,"And men the wisest blind,"
8368,RESIGNATION.,And bliss our aim; pronounce us all
8369,RESIGNATION.,"Distracted, or resigned;"
8370,RESIGNATION.,
8371,RESIGNATION.,"Resign'd through duty, interest, shame;"
8372,RESIGNATION.,"Deep shame! dare I complain,"
8373,RESIGNATION.,When (wondrous truth!) in heaven itself
8374,RESIGNATION.,Joy ow'd its birth to pain?
8375,RESIGNATION.,
8376,RESIGNATION.,And pain for me! for me was drain'd
8377,RESIGNATION.,Gall's overflowing bowl;
8378,RESIGNATION.,And shall one drop to murmur bold
8379,RESIGNATION.,Provoke my guilty soul?
8380,RESIGNATION.,
8381,RESIGNATION.,"If pardon'd this, what cause, what crime"
8382,RESIGNATION.,Can indignation raise?
8383,RESIGNATION.,"The sun was lighted up to shine,"
8384,RESIGNATION.,And man was born to praise;
8385,RESIGNATION.,
8386,RESIGNATION.,"And when to praise the man shall cease,"
8387,RESIGNATION.,Or sun to strike the view;
8388,RESIGNATION.,A cloud dishonors both; but man's
8389,RESIGNATION.,The blacker of the two:
8390,RESIGNATION.,
8391,RESIGNATION.,For oh! ingratitude how black!
8392,RESIGNATION.,With most profound amaze
8393,RESIGNATION.,"At love, which man belov'd o'erlooks,"
8394,RESIGNATION.,Astonish'd angels gaze.
8395,RESIGNATION.,
8396,RESIGNATION.,"Praise cheers, and warms, like generous wine;"
8397,RESIGNATION.,"Praise, more divine than prayer;"
8398,RESIGNATION.,Prayer points our ready path to heaven;
8399,RESIGNATION.,Praise is already there.
8400,RESIGNATION.,
8401,RESIGNATION.,"Let plausive resignation rise,"
8402,RESIGNATION.,And banish all complaint;
8403,RESIGNATION.,"All virtues thronging into one,"
8404,RESIGNATION.,It finishes the saint;
8405,RESIGNATION.,
8406,RESIGNATION.,"Makes the man bless'd, as man can be;"
8407,RESIGNATION.,Life's labours renders light;
8408,RESIGNATION.,"Darts beams through fate's incumbent gloom,"
8409,RESIGNATION.,And lights our sun by night;
8410,RESIGNATION.,
8411,RESIGNATION.,"'T is nature's brightest ornament,"
8412,RESIGNATION.,"The richest gift of grace,"
8413,RESIGNATION.,"Rival of angels, and supreme"
8414,RESIGNATION.,Proprietor of peace;
8415,RESIGNATION.,
8416,RESIGNATION.,"Nay, peace beyond, no small degree"
8417,RESIGNATION.,Of rapture 't will impart;
8418,RESIGNATION.,"Know, madam! when your heart's in heaven,"
8419,RESIGNATION.,"""All heaven is in your heart."""
8420,RESIGNATION.,
8421,RESIGNATION.,But who to heaven their hearts can raise?
8422,RESIGNATION.,"Denied divine support,"
8423,RESIGNATION.,All virtue dies; support divine
8424,RESIGNATION.,The wise with ardour court:
8425,RESIGNATION.,
8426,RESIGNATION.,"When prayer partakes the seraph's fire,"
8427,RESIGNATION.,"'T is mounted on his wing,"
8428,RESIGNATION.,"Bursts thro' heaven's crystal gates, and"
8429,RESIGNATION.,Sure audience of its king:
8430,RESIGNATION.,
8431,RESIGNATION.,The labouring soul from sore distress
8432,RESIGNATION.,That bless'd expedient frees;
8433,RESIGNATION.,I see you far advanc'd in peace;
8434,RESIGNATION.,I see you on your knees:
8435,RESIGNATION.,
8436,RESIGNATION.,How on that posture has the beam
8437,RESIGNATION.,Divine for ever shone!
8438,RESIGNATION.,"An humble heart, God's other seat!(58)"
8439,RESIGNATION.,The rival of his throne:
8440,RESIGNATION.,
8441,RESIGNATION.,And stoops Omnipotence so low!
8442,RESIGNATION.,"And condescends to dwell,"
8443,RESIGNATION.,"Eternity's inhabitant,"
8444,RESIGNATION.,"Well pleas'd, in such a cell?"
8445,RESIGNATION.,
8446,RESIGNATION.,Such honour how shall we repay?
8447,RESIGNATION.,How treat our guest divine?
8448,RESIGNATION.,The sacrifice supreme be slain!
8449,RESIGNATION.,Let self-will die: resign.
8450,RESIGNATION.,
8451,RESIGNATION.,"Thus far, at large, on our disease;"
8452,RESIGNATION.,"Now let the cause be shown,"
8453,RESIGNATION.,"Whence rises, and will ever rise,"
8454,RESIGNATION.,The dismal human groan:
8455,RESIGNATION.,
8456,RESIGNATION.,What our sole fountain of distress?
8457,RESIGNATION.,Strong passion for this scene;
8458,RESIGNATION.,"That trifles make important, things"
8459,RESIGNATION.,Of mighty moment mean:
8460,RESIGNATION.,
8461,RESIGNATION.,When earth's dark maxims poison shed
8462,RESIGNATION.,"On our polluted souls,"
8463,RESIGNATION.,Our hearts and interests fly as far
8464,RESIGNATION.,"Asunder, as the poles."
8465,RESIGNATION.,
8466,RESIGNATION.,"Like princes in a cottage nurs'd,"
8467,RESIGNATION.,"Unknown their royal race,"
8468,RESIGNATION.,"With abject aims, and sordid joys,"
8469,RESIGNATION.,Our grandeur we disgrace;
8470,RESIGNATION.,
8471,RESIGNATION.,"O! for an Archimedes new,"
8472,RESIGNATION.,"Of moral powers possess'd,"
8473,RESIGNATION.,"The world to move, and quite expel"
8474,RESIGNATION.,That traitor from the breast.
8475,RESIGNATION.,
8476,RESIGNATION.,No small advantage may be reap'd
8477,RESIGNATION.,From thought whence we descend;
8478,RESIGNATION.,"From weighing well, and prizing weigh'd"
8479,RESIGNATION.,"Our origin, and end:"
8480,RESIGNATION.,
8481,RESIGNATION.,From far above the glorious sun
8482,RESIGNATION.,To this dim scene we came:
8483,RESIGNATION.,"And may, if wise, for ever bask"
8484,RESIGNATION.,In great Jehovah's beam:
8485,RESIGNATION.,
8486,RESIGNATION.,Let that bright beam on reason rous'd
8487,RESIGNATION.,"In awful lustre rise,"
8488,RESIGNATION.,"Earth's giant ills are dwarf'd at once,"
8489,RESIGNATION.,And all disquiet dies.
8490,RESIGNATION.,
8491,RESIGNATION.,"Earth's glories too their splendour lose,"
8492,RESIGNATION.,Those phantoms charm no more;
8493,RESIGNATION.,"Empire's a feather for a fool,"
8494,RESIGNATION.,And Indian mines are poor:
8495,RESIGNATION.,
8496,RESIGNATION.,"Then levell'd quite, whilst yet alive,"
8497,RESIGNATION.,The monarch and his slave;
8498,RESIGNATION.,Not wait enlighten'd minds to learn
8499,RESIGNATION.,That lesson from the grave:
8500,RESIGNATION.,
8501,RESIGNATION.,A George the Third would then be low
8502,RESIGNATION.,"As Lewis in renown,"
8503,RESIGNATION.,Could he not boast of glory more
8504,RESIGNATION.,Than sparkles from a crown.
8505,RESIGNATION.,
8506,RESIGNATION.,When human glory rises high
8507,RESIGNATION.,As human glory can;
8508,RESIGNATION.,"When, though the king is truly great,"
8509,RESIGNATION.,Still greater is the man;
8510,RESIGNATION.,
8511,RESIGNATION.,"The man is dead, where virtue fails;"
8512,RESIGNATION.,And though the monarch proud
8513,RESIGNATION.,"In grandeur shines, his gorgeous robe"
8514,RESIGNATION.,Is but a gaudy shroud.
8515,RESIGNATION.,
8516,RESIGNATION.,"Wisdom! where art thou? None on earth,"
8517,RESIGNATION.,"Though grasping wealth, fame, power,"
8518,RESIGNATION.,"But what, O death! through thy approach,"
8519,RESIGNATION.,Is wiser every hour;
8520,RESIGNATION.,
8521,RESIGNATION.,"Approach how swift, how unconfin'd!"
8522,RESIGNATION.,"Worms feast on viands rare,"
8523,RESIGNATION.,Those little epicures have kings
8524,RESIGNATION.,To grace their bill of fare:
8525,RESIGNATION.,
8526,RESIGNATION.,From kings what resignation due
8527,RESIGNATION.,"To that almighty will,"
8528,RESIGNATION.,"Which thrones bestows, and, when they fail,"
8529,RESIGNATION.,Can throne them higher still!
8530,RESIGNATION.,
8531,RESIGNATION.,"Who truly great? The good and brave,"
8532,RESIGNATION.,The masters of a mind
8533,RESIGNATION.,"The will divine to do resolv'd,"
8534,RESIGNATION.,To suffer it resign'd.
8535,RESIGNATION.,
8536,RESIGNATION.,"Madam! if that may give it weight,"
8537,RESIGNATION.,The trifle you receive
8538,RESIGNATION.,"Is dated from a solemn scene,"
8539,RESIGNATION.,The border of the grave;
8540,RESIGNATION.,
8541,RESIGNATION.,Where strongly strikes the trembling soul
8542,RESIGNATION.,"Eternity's dread power,"
8543,RESIGNATION.,As bursting on it through the thin
8544,RESIGNATION.,Partition of an hour;
8545,RESIGNATION.,
8546,RESIGNATION.,"Hear this, Voltaire! but this, from me,"
8547,RESIGNATION.,Runs hazard of your frown;
8548,RESIGNATION.,"However, spare it; ere you die,"
8549,RESIGNATION.,Such thoughts will be your own.
8550,RESIGNATION.,
8551,RESIGNATION.,In mercy to yourself forbear
8552,RESIGNATION.,"My notions to chastise,"
8553,RESIGNATION.,Lest unawares the gay Voltaire
8554,RESIGNATION.,Should blame Voltaire the wise:
8555,RESIGNATION.,
8556,RESIGNATION.,"Fame's trumpet rattling in your ear,"
8557,RESIGNATION.,"Now, makes us disagree;"
8558,RESIGNATION.,"When a far louder trumpet sounds,"
8559,RESIGNATION.,Voltaire will close with me:
8560,RESIGNATION.,
8561,RESIGNATION.,"How shocking is that modesty,"
8562,RESIGNATION.,Which keeps some honest men
8563,RESIGNATION.,"From urging what their hearts suggest,"
8564,RESIGNATION.,When brav'd by folly's pen.
8565,RESIGNATION.,
8566,RESIGNATION.,"Assaulting truths, of which in all"
8567,RESIGNATION.,Is sown the sacred seed!
8568,RESIGNATION.,"Our constitution's orthodox,"
8569,RESIGNATION.,And closes with our creed:
8570,RESIGNATION.,
8571,RESIGNATION.,"What then are they, whose proud conceits"
8572,RESIGNATION.,Superior wisdom boast?
8573,RESIGNATION.,"Wretches, who fight their own belief,"
8574,RESIGNATION.,And labour to be lost!
8575,RESIGNATION.,
8576,RESIGNATION.,Though vice by no superior joys
8577,RESIGNATION.,Her heroes keeps in pay;
8578,RESIGNATION.,Through pure disinterested love
8579,RESIGNATION.,Of ruin they obey!
8580,RESIGNATION.,
8581,RESIGNATION.,"Strict their devotion to the wrong,"
8582,RESIGNATION.,Though tempted by no prize;
8583,RESIGNATION.,"Hard their commandments, and their creed"
8584,RESIGNATION.,A magazine of lies
8585,RESIGNATION.,
8586,RESIGNATION.,From fancy's forge: gay fancy smiles
8587,RESIGNATION.,"At reason plain, and cool;"
8588,RESIGNATION.,"Fancy, whose curious trade it is"
8589,RESIGNATION.,To make the finest fool.
8590,RESIGNATION.,
8591,RESIGNATION.,Voltaire! long life's the greatest curse
8592,RESIGNATION.,"That mortals can receive,"
8593,RESIGNATION.,When they imagine the chief end
8594,RESIGNATION.,Of living is to live;
8595,RESIGNATION.,
8596,RESIGNATION.,"Quite thoughtless of their day of death,"
8597,RESIGNATION.,That birthday of their sorrow!
8598,RESIGNATION.,"Knowing, it may be distant far,"
8599,RESIGNATION.,Nor crush them till--to-morrow.
8600,RESIGNATION.,
8601,RESIGNATION.,"These are cold, northern thoughts, conceiv'd"
8602,RESIGNATION.,Beneath an humble cot;
8603,RESIGNATION.,"Not mine, your genius, or your state,"
8604,RESIGNATION.,No castle is my lot:(59)
8605,RESIGNATION.,
8606,RESIGNATION.,"But soon, quite level shall we lie;"
8607,RESIGNATION.,"And, what pride most bemoans,"
8608,RESIGNATION.,"Our parts, in rank so distant now,"
8609,RESIGNATION.,As level as our bones;
8610,RESIGNATION.,
8611,RESIGNATION.,Hear you that sound? Alarming sound!
8612,RESIGNATION.,Prepare to meet your fate!
8613,RESIGNATION.,"One, who writes finis to our works,"
8614,RESIGNATION.,Is knocking at the gate;
8615,RESIGNATION.,
8616,RESIGNATION.,Far other works will soon be weigh'd;
8617,RESIGNATION.,Far other judges sit;
8618,RESIGNATION.,"Far other crowns be lost or won,"
8619,RESIGNATION.,Than fire ambitious wit:
8620,RESIGNATION.,
8621,RESIGNATION.,"Their wit far brightest will be prov'd,"
8622,RESIGNATION.,Who sunk it in good sense;
8623,RESIGNATION.,And veneration most profound
8624,RESIGNATION.,Of dread omnipotence.
8625,RESIGNATION.,
8626,RESIGNATION.,'Tis that alone unlocks the gate
8627,RESIGNATION.,Of blest eternity;
8628,RESIGNATION.,"O! mayst thou never, never lose"
8629,RESIGNATION.,That more than golden key!(60)
8630,RESIGNATION.,
8631,RESIGNATION.,"Whate'er may seem too rough excuse,"
8632,RESIGNATION.,Your good I have at heart:
8633,RESIGNATION.,Since from my soul I wish you well;
8634,RESIGNATION.,As yet we must not part:
8635,RESIGNATION.,
8636,RESIGNATION.,"Shall you, and I, in love with life,"
8637,RESIGNATION.,"Life's future schemes contrive,"
8638,RESIGNATION.,"The world in wonder not unjust,"
8639,RESIGNATION.,That we are still alive?
8640,RESIGNATION.,
8641,RESIGNATION.,What have we left? How mean in man
8642,RESIGNATION.,A shadow's shade to crave!
8643,RESIGNATION.,"When life, so vain! is vainer still,"
8644,RESIGNATION.,'Tis time to take your leave:
8645,RESIGNATION.,
8646,RESIGNATION.,"Happier, than happiest life, is death,"
8647,RESIGNATION.,"Who, falling in the field"
8648,RESIGNATION.,"Of conflict with his rebel will,"
8649,RESIGNATION.,"Writes vici, on his shield;"
8650,RESIGNATION.,
8651,RESIGNATION.,"So falling man, immortal heir"
8652,RESIGNATION.,Of an eternal prize;
8653,RESIGNATION.,"Undaunted at the gloomy grave,"

9086,--HOR.,"One, throw the mantle's crimson folds around;"
9087,--HOR.,"By that, the sword on his proud thigh be plac'd;"
9088,--HOR.,"This, clasp the diamond girdle round his waist;"
9089,--HOR.,"His breast, with rays, let just Godolphin spread;"
9090,--HOR.,Wise Burleigh plant the plumage on his head;
9091,--HOR.,"And Edward own, since first he fix'd the race,"
9092,--HOR.,None press'd fair glory with a swifter pace.
9093,--HOR.,When fate would call some mighty genius forth
9094,--HOR.,"To wake a drooping age to godlike worth,"
9095,--HOR.,"Or aid some favourite king's illustrious toil,"
9096,--HOR.,It bids his blood with generous ardour boil;
9097,--HOR.,"His blood, from virtue's celebrated source,"
9098,--HOR.,"Pour'd down the steep of time, a lengthen'd course;"
9099,--HOR.,"That men prepar'd may just attention pay,"
9100,--HOR.,"Warn'd by the dawn to mark the glorious day,"
9101,--HOR.,When all the scatter'd merits of his line
9102,--HOR.,"Collected to a point, intensely shine."
9103,--HOR.,"See, Britain, see thy Walpole shine from far,"
9104,--HOR.,"His azure ribbon, and his radiant star;"
9105,--HOR.,"A star that, with auspicious beams, shall guide"
9106,--HOR.,"Thy vessel safe, through fortune's roughest tide."
9107,--HOR.,"If peace still smiles, by this shall commerce steer"
9108,--HOR.,"A finish'd course, in triumph round the sphere;"
9109,--HOR.,"And, gathering tribute from each distant shore,"
9110,--HOR.,In Britain's lap the world's abundance pour.
9111,--HOR.,"If war's ordain'd, this star shall dart its beams"
9112,--HOR.,"Through that black cloud which, rising from the Thames,"
9113,--HOR.,"With thunder, form'd of Brunswick's wrath, is sent"
9114,--HOR.,"To claim the seas, and awe the continent."
9115,--HOR.,"This shall direct it where the bolt to throw,"
9116,--HOR.,"A star for us, a comet to the foe."
9117,--HOR.,"At this the muse shall kindle, and aspire:"
9118,--HOR.,"My breast, O Walpole, glows with grateful fire."
9119,--HOR.,"The streams of royal bounty, turn'd by thee,"
9120,--HOR.,Refresh the dry domains of poesy.
9121,--HOR.,"My fortune shows, when arts are Walpole's care,"
9122,--HOR.,What slender worth forbids us to despair:
9123,--HOR.,Be this thy partial smile from censure free;
9124,--HOR.,"'Twas meant for merit, though it fell on me."
9125,--HOR.,"Since Brunswick's smile has authoris'd my muse,"
9126,--HOR.,"Chaste be her conduct, and sublime her views."
9127,--HOR.,"False praises are the whoredoms of the pen,"
9128,--HOR.,Which prostitute fair fame to worthless men:
9129,--HOR.,This profanation of celestial fire
9130,--HOR.,"Makes fools despise, what wise men should admire."
9131,--HOR.,"Let those I praise to distant times be known,"
9132,--HOR.,"Not by their author's merit, but their own."
9133,--HOR.,"If others think the task is hard, to weed"
9134,--HOR.,"From verse rank flattery's vivacious seed,"
9135,--HOR.,"And rooted deep; one means must set them free,"
9136,--HOR.,Patron! and patriot! let them sing of thee.
9137,--HOR.,"While vulgar trees ignobler honours wear,"
9138,--HOR.,"Nor those retain, when winter chills the year;"
9139,--HOR.,"The generous orange, favourite of the sun,"
9140,--HOR.,With vigorous charms can through the seasons run;
9141,--HOR.,Defies the storm with her tenacious green;
9142,--HOR.,And flowers and fruits in rival pomp are seen:
9143,--HOR.,"Where blossoms fall, still fairer blossoms spring;"
9144,--HOR.,And midst their sweets the feather'd poets sing.
9145,--HOR.,"On Walpole, thus, may pleas'd Britannia view"
9146,--HOR.,At once her ornament and profit too;
9147,--HOR.,"The fruit of service, and the bloom of fame,"
9148,--HOR.,Matur'd and gilded by the royal beam.
9149,--HOR.,"He, when the nipping blasts of envy rise"
9150,--HOR.,"Its guilt can pity, and its rage despise;"
9151,--HOR.,"Lets fall no honours, but, securely great,"
9152,--HOR.,Unfaded holds the colour of his fate:

9154,--HOR.,By wisdom deeply rooted in success;
9155,--HOR.,"One glory shed, a brighter is display'd;(61)"
9156,--HOR.,And the charm'd muses shelter in his shade.
9157,--HOR.,"O how I long, enkindled by the theme,"
9158,--HOR.,In deep eternity to launch thy name!
9159,--HOR.,"Thy name in view, no rights of verse I plead,"
9160,--HOR.,"But what chaste truth indites, old time shall read."
9161,--HOR.,"""Behold! a man of ancient faith and blood,"
9162,--HOR.,"Which, soon, beat high for arts, and public good;"
9163,--HOR.,"Whose glory great, but natural appears,"
9164,--HOR.,The genuine growth of services and years;
9165,--HOR.,"No sudden exhalation drawn on high,"
9166,--HOR.,And fondly gilt by partial majesty:
9167,--HOR.,"One bearing greatest toils with greatest ease,"
9168,--HOR.,"One born to serve us, and yet born to please:"
9169,--HOR.,"Whom, while our rights in equal scales he lays,"
9170,--HOR.,"The prince may trust, and yet the people praise;"
9171,--HOR.,"His genius ardent, yet his judgment clear,"
9172,--HOR.,"His tongue is flowing, and his heart sincere,"
9173,--HOR.,"His counsel guides, his temper cheers our isle,"
9174,--HOR.,"And, smiling, gives three kingdoms cause to smile."""
9175,--HOR.,"Joy then to Britain, blest with such a son,"
9176,--HOR.,"To Walpole joy, by whom the prize is won;"
9177,--HOR.,Who nobly conscious meets the smiles of fate;
9178,--HOR.,True greatness lies in daring to be great.
9179,--HOR.,"Let dastard souls, or affectation, run"
9180,--HOR.,"To shades, nor wear bright honours fairly won;"
9181,--HOR.,"Such men prefer, misled by false applause,"
9182,--HOR.,The pride of modesty to virtue's cause.
9183,--HOR.,"Honours, which make the face of virtue fair,"
9184,--HOR.,"'Tis great to merit, and 'tis wise to wear;"
9185,--HOR.,"'Tis holding up the prize to public view,"
9186,--HOR.,"Confirms grown virtue, and inflames the new;"
9187,--HOR.,"Heightens the lustre of our age and clime,"
9188,--HOR.,And sheds rich seeds of worth for future time.
9189,--HOR.,"Proud chiefs alone, in fields of slaughter fam'd,"
9190,--HOR.,"Of old, this azure bloom of glory claim'd,"
9191,--HOR.,"As when stern Ajax pour'd a purple flood,"
9192,--HOR.,"The violet rose, fair daughter of his blood."
9193,--HOR.,"Now rival wisdom dares the wreath divide,"
9194,--HOR.,And both Minervas rise in equal pride;
9195,--HOR.,"Proclaiming loud, a monarch fills the throne,"
9196,--HOR.,Who shines illustrious not in wars alone.
9197,--HOR.,Let fame look lovely in Britannia's eyes;
9198,--HOR.,"They coldly court desert, who fame despise."
9199,--HOR.,"For what's ambition, but fair virtue's sail?"
9200,--HOR.,"And what applause, but her propitious gale?"
9201,--HOR.,"When swell'd with that, she fleets before the wind"
9202,--HOR.,"To glorious aims, as to the port design'd;"
9203,--HOR.,"When chain'd, without it, to the labouring oar,"
9204,--HOR.,"She toils! she pants! nor gains the flying shore,"
9205,--HOR.,"From her sublime pursuits, or turn'd aside"
9206,--HOR.,"By blasts of envy, or by fortune's tide:"
9207,--HOR.,"For one that has succeeded ten are lost,"
9208,--HOR.,"Of equal talents, ere they make the coast."
9209,--HOR.,"Then let renown to worth divine incite,"
9210,--HOR.,"With all her beams, but throw those beams aright."
9211,--HOR.,"Then merit droops, and genius downward tends,"
9212,--HOR.,"When godlike glory, like our land, descends."
9213,--HOR.,"Custom the garter long confin'd to few,"
9214,--HOR.,"And gave to birth, exalted virtue's due:"
9215,--HOR.,Walpole has thrown the proud enclosure down;
9216,--HOR.,And high desert embraces fair renown.
9217,--HOR.,"Though rival'd, let the peerage smiling see"
9218,--HOR.,"(Smiling, in justice to their own degree)"
9219,--HOR.,This proud reward by majesty bestow'd
9220,--HOR.,On worth like that whence first the peerage flow'd.
9221,--HOR.,"From frowns of fate Britannia's bliss'd to guard,"
9222,--HOR.,"Let subjects merit, and let kings reward."
9223,--HOR.,"Gods are most gods by giving to excel,"
9224,--HOR.,"And kings most like them, by rewarding well."
9225,--HOR.,"Though strong the twanging nerve, and drawn aright,"
9226,--HOR.,Short is the winged arrow's upward flight;
9227,--HOR.,"But if an eagle it transfix on high,"
9228,--HOR.,"Lodg'd in the wound, it soars into the sky."
9229,--HOR.,
9230,--HOR.,"Thus while I sing thee with unequal lays,"
9231,--HOR.,And wound perhaps that worth I mean to praise;
9232,--HOR.,"Yet I transcend myself, I rise in fame,"
9233,--HOR.,"Not lifted by my genius, but my theme."
9234,--HOR.,"No more: for in this dread suspense of fate,"
9235,--HOR.,"Now kingdoms fluctuate, and in dark debate"
9236,--HOR.,"Weigh peace and war, now Europe's eyes are bent"
9237,--HOR.,"On mighty Brunswick, for the great event,"
9238,--HOR.,Brunswick of kings the terror or defence!
9239,--HOR.,Who dares detain thee at a world's expense?

9257,--VIRG.,"When Rome, my lord, in her full glory shone,"
9258,--VIRG.,"And great Augustus rul'd the globe alone,"
9259,--VIRG.,While suppliant kings in all their pomp and state
9260,--VIRG.,"Swarm'd in his courts, and throng'd his palace gate;"
9261,--VIRG.,"Horace did oft the mighty man detain,"
9262,--VIRG.,And sooth'd his breast with no ignoble strain;
9263,--VIRG.,"Now soar'd aloft, now struck an humbler string;"
9264,--VIRG.,And taught the Roman genius how to sing.
9265,--VIRG.,"Pardon, if I his freedom dare pursue,"
9266,--VIRG.,"Who know no want of Cæsar, finding you;"
9267,--VIRG.,The muse's friend is pleas'd the muse should press
9268,--VIRG.,"Through circling crowds, and labor for access,"
9269,--VIRG.,"That partial to his darling he may prove,"
9270,--VIRG.,"And shining throngs for her reproach remove,"
9271,--VIRG.,To all the world industrious to proclaim
9272,--VIRG.,"His love of arts, and boast the glorious flame."
9273,--VIRG.,"Long has the western world reclin'd her head,"
9274,--VIRG.,"Pour'd forth her sorrow, and bewail'd her dead;"
9275,--VIRG.,"Fell discord through her borders fiercely rang'd,"
9276,--VIRG.,"And shook her nations, and her monarchs chang'd;"
9277,--VIRG.,"By land and sea, its utmost rage employ'd;"
9278,--VIRG.,Nor heaven repair'd so fast as men destroy'd.
9279,--VIRG.,"In vain kind summers plentuous fields bestow'd,"
9280,--VIRG.,In vain the vintage liberally flow'd;
9281,--VIRG.,"Alarms from loaden boards all pleasures chas'd,"
9282,--VIRG.,And robb'd the rich Burgundian grape of taste;
9283,--VIRG.,"The smiles of Nature could no blessing bring,"
9284,--VIRG.,"The fruitful autumn, or the flowery spring;"
9285,--VIRG.,"Time was distinguish'd by the sword and spear,"
9286,--VIRG.,Not by the various aspects of the year;
9287,--VIRG.,"The trumpet's sound proclaim'd a milder sky,"
9288,--VIRG.,And bloodshed told us when the sun was nigh.
9289,--VIRG.,"But now (so soon is Britain's blessing seen,"
9290,--VIRG.,When such as you are near her glorious queen!)
9291,--VIRG.,"Now peace, though long repuls'd, arrives at last,"
9292,--VIRG.,And bids us smile on all our labours past;
9293,--VIRG.,"Bids every nation cease her wonted moan,"
9294,--VIRG.,And every monarch call his crown his own:
9295,--VIRG.,To valour gentler virtues now succeed;
9296,--VIRG.,No longer is the great man born to bleed;
9297,--VIRG.,"Renown'd in councils, brave Argyle shall tell,"
9298,--VIRG.,Wisdom and prowess in one breast may dwell:
9299,--VIRG.,"Through milder tracts he soars to deathless fame,"
9300,--VIRG.,And without trembling we resound his name.
9301,--VIRG.,"No more the rising harvest whets the sword,"
9302,--VIRG.,No longer waves uncertain of its lord;
9303,--VIRG.,"Who cast the seed, the golden sheaf shall claim,"
9304,--VIRG.,Nor chance of battle change the master's name.
9305,--VIRG.,Each stream unstain'd with blood more smoothly flows;
9306,--VIRG.,The brighter sun a fuller day bestows;
9307,--VIRG.,"All nature seems to wear a cheerful face,"
9308,--VIRG.,And thank great Anna for returning peace.
9309,--VIRG.,"The patient thus, when on his bed of pain,"
9310,--VIRG.,"No longer he invokes the gods in vain,"
9311,--VIRG.,But rises to new life; in every field
9312,--VIRG.,"He finds Elysium, rivers nectar yield;"
9313,--VIRG.,"Nothing so cheap and vulgar but can please,"
9314,--VIRG.,And borrow beauties from his late disease.
9315,--VIRG.,"Nor is it peace alone, but such a peace,"
9316,--VIRG.,As more than bids the rage of battle cease.
9317,--VIRG.,"Death may determine war, and rest succeed,"
9318,--VIRG.,'Cause nought survives on which our rage may feed:
9319,--VIRG.,"In faithful friends we lose our glorious foes,"
9320,--VIRG.,And strifes of love exalt our sweet repose.
9321,--VIRG.,"See graceful Bolingbroke, your friend, advance,"
9322,--VIRG.,Nor miss his Lansdowne in the court of France;
9323,--VIRG.,"So well receiv'd, so welcome, so at home,"
9324,--VIRG.,"(Blest change of fate,) in Bourbon's stately dome;"
9325,--VIRG.,"The monarch pleas'd, descending from his throne,"
9326,--VIRG.,Will not that Anna call him all her own;
9327,--VIRG.,"He claims a part, and looking round to find"
9328,--VIRG.,"Something might speak the fulness of his mind,"
9329,--VIRG.,"A diamond shines, which oft had touch'd him near,"
9330,--VIRG.,"Renew'd his grief, and robb'd him of a tear;"
9331,--VIRG.,"Now first with joy beheld, well plac'd on one,"
9332,--VIRG.,Who makes him less regret his darling son;
9333,--VIRG.,"So dear is Anna's minister, so great,"
9334,--VIRG.,Your glorious friend in his own private state.
9335,--VIRG.,"To make our nations longer two, in vain"
9336,--VIRG.,Does nature interpose the raging main:
9337,--VIRG.,"The Gallic shore to distant Britain grows,"
9338,--VIRG.,"For Lewis Thames, the Seine for Anna flows:"
9339,--VIRG.,"From conflicts pass'd each other's worth we find,"
9340,--VIRG.,And thence in stricter friendship now are join'd;
9341,--VIRG.,"Each wound receiv'd, now pleads the cause of love,"
9342,--VIRG.,And former injuries endearments prove.
9343,--VIRG.,"What Briton but must prize th' illustrious sword,"
9344,--VIRG.,That cause of fear to Churchill could afford?
9345,--VIRG.,"Who sworn to Bourbon's sceptre, but must frame"
9346,--VIRG.,"Vast thoughts of him, that could brave Tallard tame?"
9347,--VIRG.,"Thus generous hatred in affection ends,"
9348,--VIRG.,"And war, which rais'd the foes, completes the friends."
9349,--VIRG.,A thousand happy consequences flow
9350,--VIRG.,(The dazzling prospect makes my bosom glow);
9351,--VIRG.,"Commerce shall lift her swelling sails, and roll"
9352,--VIRG.,Her wealthy fleets secure from pole to pole;
9353,--VIRG.,"The British merchant, who with care and pain"
9354,--VIRG.,For many moons sees only skies and main;
9355,--VIRG.,"When now in view of his loved native shore,"
9356,--VIRG.,"The perils of the dreadful ocean o'er,"
9357,--VIRG.,"Cause to regret his wealth no more shall find,"
9358,--VIRG.,Nor curse the mercy of the sea and wind;
9359,--VIRG.,"By hardest fate condemn'd to serve a foe,"
9360,--VIRG.,And give him strength to strike a deeper blow.
9361,--VIRG.,Sweet Philomela providently flies
9362,--VIRG.,"To distant woods and streams, for such supplies,"
9363,--VIRG.,"To feed her young, and make them try the wing,"
9364,--VIRG.,And with their tender notes attempt to sing:
9365,--VIRG.,"Meanwhile, the fowler spreads his secret snare,"
9366,--VIRG.,And renders vain the tuneful mother's care.
9367,--VIRG.,Britannia's bold adventurer of late
9368,--VIRG.,The foaming ocean plow'd with equal fate.
9369,--VIRG.,"Goodness is greatness in its utmost height,"
9370,--VIRG.,"And power a curse, if not a friend to right:"
9371,--VIRG.,"To conquer is to make dissension cease,"
9372,--VIRG.,That man may serve the King of kings in peace.
9373,--VIRG.,"Religion now shall all her rays dispense,"
9374,--VIRG.,And shine abroad in perfect excellence;
9375,--VIRG.,"Else we may dread some greater curse at hand,"
9376,--VIRG.,To scourge a thoughtless and ungrateful land:
9377,--VIRG.,"Now war is weary, and retir'd to rest;"
9378,--VIRG.,"The meagre famine, and the spotted pest,"
9379,--VIRG.,"Deputed in her stead, may blast the day,"
9380,--VIRG.,And sweep the relics of the sword away.
9381,--VIRG.,"When peaceful Numa fill'd the Roman throne,"
9382,--VIRG.,Jove in the fulness of his glory shone;
9383,--VIRG.,"Wise Solomon, a stranger to the sword,"
9384,--VIRG.,Was born to raise a temple to the Lord.
9385,--VIRG.,"Anne too shall build, and every sacred pile"
9386,--VIRG.,Speak peace eternal to Britannia's isle.
9387,--VIRG.,"Those mighty souls, whom military care"
9388,--VIRG.,"Diverted from their only great affair,"
9389,--VIRG.,"Shall bend their full united force, to bless"
9390,--VIRG.,Th' Almighty Author of their late success.
9391,--VIRG.,And what is all the world subdued to this?
9392,--VIRG.,The grave sets bounds to sublunary bliss;
9393,--VIRG.,"But there are conquests to great Anna known,"
9394,--VIRG.,Above the splendour of an earthly throne;
9395,--VIRG.,"Conquests! whose triumph is too great, within"
9396,--VIRG.,The scanty bounds of matter to begin;
9397,--VIRG.,"Too glorious to shine forth, till it has run"
9398,--VIRG.,"Beyond this darkness of the stars and sun,"
9399,--VIRG.,"And shall whole ages past be still, still but begun."
9400,--VIRG.,"Heroic shades! whom war has swept away,"
9401,--VIRG.,"Look down, and smile on this auspicious day:"
9402,--VIRG.,"Now boast your deaths; to those your glory tell,"
9403,--VIRG.,Who or at Agincourt or Cressy fell;
9404,--VIRG.,"Then deep into eternity retire,"
9405,--VIRG.,Of greater things than peace or war inquire;
9406,--VIRG.,"Fully content, and unconcern'd, to know"
9407,--VIRG.,What farther passes in the world below.
9408,--VIRG.,The bravest of mankind shall now have leave
9409,--VIRG.,"To die but once, nor piece-meal seek the grave:"
9410,--VIRG.,"On gain or pleasure bent, we shall not meet"
9411,--VIRG.,Sad melancholy numbers in each street
9412,--VIRG.,"(Owners of bones dispers'd on Flandria's plain,"
9413,--VIRG.,Or wasting in the bottom of the main);
9414,--VIRG.,"To turn us back from joy, in tender fear,"
9415,--VIRG.,"Lest it an insult of their woes appear,"
9416,--VIRG.,"And make us grudge ourselves that wealth, their blood"
9417,--VIRG.,"Perhaps preserv'd, who starve, or beg for food."
9418,--VIRG.,"Devotion shall run pure, and disengage"
9419,--VIRG.,From that strange fate of mixing peace with rage.
9420,--VIRG.,"On heaven without a sin we now may call,"
9421,--VIRG.,And guiltless to our Maker prostrate fall;
9422,--VIRG.,"Be Christians while we pray, nor in one breath"
9423,--VIRG.,"Ask mercy for ourselves, for others death."
9424,--VIRG.,"But O! I view with transport arts restor'd,"
9425,--VIRG.,Which double use to Britain shall afford;
9426,--VIRG.,"Secure her glory purchas'd in the field,"
9427,--VIRG.,And yet for future peace sweet motives yield:
9428,--VIRG.,"While we contemplate on the painted wall,"
9429,--VIRG.,"The pressing Briton, and the flying Gaul,"
9430,--VIRG.,"In such bright images, such living grace,"
9431,--VIRG.,As leave great Raphael but the second place;
9432,--VIRG.,"Our cheeks shall glow, our heaving bosoms rise,"
9433,--VIRG.,And martial ardours sparkle in our eyes;
9434,--VIRG.,"Much we shall triumph in our battles past,"
9435,--VIRG.,And yet consent those battles prove our last;
9436,--VIRG.,"Lest, while in arms for brighter fame we strive,"
9437,--VIRG.,We lose the means to keep that fame alive.
9438,--VIRG.,"In silent groves the birds delight to sing,"
9439,--VIRG.,Or near the margin of a secret spring:
9440,--VIRG.,"Now all is calm, sweet music shall improve,"
9441,--VIRG.,"Nor kindle rage, but be the nurse of love."
9442,--VIRG.,"But what's the warbling voice, the trembling string,"
9443,--VIRG.,"Or breathing canvass, when the muses sing?"
9444,--VIRG.,"The muse, my lord, your care above the rest,"
9445,--VIRG.,With rising joy dilates my partial breast;
9446,--VIRG.,"The thunder of the battle ceas'd to roar,"
9447,--VIRG.,Ere Greece her godlike poets taught to soar;
9448,--VIRG.,"Rome's dreadful foe, great Hannibal, was dead,"
9449,--VIRG.,And all her warlike neighbours round her bled;
9450,--VIRG.,"For Janus shut, her Iö Pæans rung,"
9451,--VIRG.,Before an Ovid or a Virgil sung.
9452,--VIRG.,"A thousand various forms the muse may wear,"
9453,--VIRG.,(A thousand various forms become the fair;)
9454,--VIRG.,"But shines in none with more majestic mien,"
9455,--VIRG.,Than when in state she draws the purple scene;
9456,--VIRG.,"Calls forth her monarchs, bids her heroes rage,"
9457,--VIRG.,And mourning beauty melt the crowded stage;
9458,--VIRG.,"Charms back past ages, gives to Britain's use"
9459,--VIRG.,The noblest virtues time did e'er produce;
9460,--VIRG.,Leaves fam'd historians' boasted art behind;
9461,--VIRG.,"They keep the soul alone, and that's confin'd,"
9462,--VIRG.,"Sought out with pains, and but by proxy speaks"
9463,--VIRG.,The hero's presence deep impression makes;
9464,--VIRG.,"The scenes his soul and body reunite,"
9465,--VIRG.,"Furnish a voice, produce him to the sight;"
9466,--VIRG.,Make our contemporary him that stood
9467,--VIRG.,"High in renown, perhaps before the flood;"
9468,--VIRG.,"Make Nestor to this age advice afford,"
9469,--VIRG.,And Hector for our service draw his sword.
9470,--VIRG.,"More glory to an author what can bring,"
9471,--VIRG.,"Whence nobler service to his country spring,"
9472,--VIRG.,"Than from those labours, which, in man's despight,"
9473,--VIRG.,Possess him with a passion for the right?
9474,--VIRG.,With honest magic make the knave inclin'd
9475,--VIRG.,To pay devotion to the virtuous mind;
9476,--VIRG.,"Through all her toils and dangers bid him rove,"
9477,--VIRG.,And with her wants and anguish fall in love?
9478,--VIRG.,"Who hears the godlike Montezuma groan,"
9479,--VIRG.,And does not wish the glorious pain his own?
9480,--VIRG.,"Lend but your understanding, and their skill"
9481,--VIRG.,Can domineer at pleasure o'er your will:
9482,--VIRG.,Nor is the short-liv'd conquest quickly past;
9483,--VIRG.,"Shame, if not choice, will hold the convert fast."
9484,--VIRG.,How often have I seen the generous bowl
9485,--VIRG.,"With pleasing force unlock a secret soul,"
9486,--VIRG.,"And steal a truth, which every sober hour"
9487,--VIRG.,(The prose of life) had kept within her power!
9488,--VIRG.,"The grape victorious often has prevail'd,"
9489,--VIRG.,"When gold and beauty, racks and tortures, fail'd:"
9490,--VIRG.,"Yet when the spirit's tumult was allay'd,"
9491,--VIRG.,"She mourn'd, perhaps, the sentiment betray'd;"
9492,--VIRG.,"But mourn'd too late, no longer could deny,"
9493,--VIRG.,And on her own confession charge the lie.
9494,--VIRG.,"Thus they, whom neither the prevailing love"
9495,--VIRG.,"Of goodness here, or mercy from above,"
9496,--VIRG.,"Or fear of future pains, or human laws"
9497,--VIRG.,"Could render advocates in virtue's cause,"
9498,--VIRG.,"Caught by the scene, have unawares resign'd"
9499,--VIRG.,Their wonted disposition of the mind:
9500,--VIRG.,"By slow degrees prevails the pleasing tale,"
9501,--VIRG.,As circling glasses on our senses steal;
9502,--VIRG.,"Till thoroughly by the muses' banquet warm'd,"
9503,--VIRG.,"The passions tossing, all the soul alarm'd,"
9504,--VIRG.,"They turn mere zealots flush'd with glorious rage,"
9505,--VIRG.,"Rise in their seats, and scarce forbear the stage,"
9506,--VIRG.,"Assistance to wrong'd innocence to bring,"
9507,--VIRG.,Or turn the poniard on some tyrant king.
9508,--VIRG.,How can they cool to villains? how subside
9509,--VIRG.,"To dregs of vice, from such a godlike pride?"
9510,--VIRG.,"To spoiling orphans how to day return,"
9511,--VIRG.,Who wept last night to see Monimia mourn?
9512,--VIRG.,"In this gay school of virtue, whom so fit"
9513,--VIRG.,"To govern, and control the world of wit,"
9514,--VIRG.,"As Talbot, Lansdowne's friend, has Britain known?"
9515,--VIRG.,Him polish'd Italy has call'd her own;
9516,--VIRG.,"He in the lap of elegance was bred,"
9517,--VIRG.,And trac'd the muses to their fountain head:
9518,--VIRG.,"But much we hope, he will enjoy at home"
9519,--VIRG.,What's nearer ancient than the modern Rome.
9520,--VIRG.,"Nor fear I mention of the court of France,"
9521,--VIRG.,When I the British genius would advance;
9522,--VIRG.,There too has Shrewsbury improv'd his taste;
9523,--VIRG.,Yet still we dare invite him to our feast:
9524,--VIRG.,For Corneille's sake I shall my thoughts suppress
9525,--VIRG.,"Of Oroonoko, and presume him less:"
9526,--VIRG.,What though we wrong him? Isabella's woe
9527,--VIRG.,Waters those bays that shall for ever grow.
9528,--VIRG.,"Our foes confess, nor we the praise refuse,"
9529,--VIRG.,The drama glories in the British muse.
9530,--VIRG.,"The French are delicate, and nicely lead"
9531,--VIRG.,Of close intrigue the labyrinthian thread;
9532,--VIRG.,"Our genius more affects the grand, than fine,"
9533,--VIRG.,Our strength can make the great plain action shine:
9534,--VIRG.,"They raise a great curiosity indeed,"
9535,--VIRG.,From his dark maze to see the hero freed;
9536,--VIRG.,"We rouse th' affections, and that hero show"
9537,--VIRG.,Gasping beneath some formidable blow:
9538,--VIRG.,They sigh; we weep: the Gallic doubt and care
9539,--VIRG.,We heighten into terror and despair;
9540,--VIRG.,"Strike home, the strongest passions boldly touch,"
9541,--VIRG.,Nor fear our audience should be pleas'd too much.
9542,--VIRG.,"What's great in nature we can greatly draw,"
9543,--VIRG.,Nor thank for beauties the dramatic law.
9544,--VIRG.,The fate of Cæsar is a tale too plain
9545,--VIRG.,The fickle Gallic taste to entertain;
9546,--VIRG.,"Their art would have perplex'd, and interwove"
9547,--VIRG.,The golden arras with gay flowers of love:
9548,--VIRG.,We know heaven made him a far greater man
9549,--VIRG.,"Than any Cæsar, in a human plan,"
9550,--VIRG.,"And such we draw him, nor are too refin'd,"
9551,--VIRG.,To stand affected with what heaven design'd.
9552,--VIRG.,"To claim attention, and the heart invade,"
9553,--VIRG.,Shakespeare but wrote the play th' Almighty made.
9554,--VIRG.,"Our neighbour's stage-art too bare-fac'd betrays,"
9555,--VIRG.,'Tis great Corneille at every scene we praise;
9556,--VIRG.,"On nature's surer aid Britannia calls,"
9557,--VIRG.,None think of Shakespeare till the curtain falls;
9558,--VIRG.,"Then with a sigh returns our audience home,"
9559,--VIRG.,"From Venice, Egypt, Persia, Greece, or Rome."
9560,--VIRG.,"France yields not to the glory of our lines,"
9561,--VIRG.,But manly conduct of our strong designs;
9562,--VIRG.,"That oft they think more justly we must own,"
9563,--VIRG.,Not ancient Greece a truer sense has shown:
9564,--VIRG.,"Greece thought but justly, they think justly too;"
9565,--VIRG.,We sometimes err by striving more to do.
9566,--VIRG.,"So well are Racine's meanest persons taught,"
9567,--VIRG.,"But change a sentiment, you make a fault;"
9568,--VIRG.,Nor dare we charge them with the want of flame:
9569,--VIRG.,"When we boast more, we own ourselves to blame."
9570,--VIRG.,"And yet in Shakespeare something still I find,"
9571,--VIRG.,That makes me less esteem all human kind;
9572,--VIRG.,"He made one nature, and another found,"
9573,--VIRG.,Both in his page with master strokes abound:
9574,--VIRG.,"His witches, fairies, and enchanted isle."
9575,--VIRG.,Bid us no longer at our nurses smile;
9576,--VIRG.,"Of lost historians we almost complain,"
9577,--VIRG.,Nor think it the creation of his brain.
9578,--VIRG.,"Who lives, when his Othello's in a trance?"
9579,--VIRG.,With his great Talbot(62) too he conquer'd France.
9580,--VIRG.,Long we may hope brave Talbot's blood will run
9581,--VIRG.,"In great descendants, Shakespeare has but one;"
9582,--VIRG.,"And him, my lord, permit me not to name,"
9583,--VIRG.,But in kind silence spare his rival's shame:--
9584,--VIRG.,"Yet I in vain that author would suppress,"
9585,--VIRG.,"What can't be greater, cannot be made less:"
9586,--VIRG.,"Each reader will defeat my fruitless aim,"
9587,--VIRG.,And to himself great Agamemnon name.
9588,--VIRG.,"Should Shakespeare rise unbless'd with Talbot's smile,"
9589,--VIRG.,E'en Shakespeare's self would curse this barren isle:
9590,--VIRG.,"But if that reigning star propitious shine,"
9591,--VIRG.,And kindly mix his gentle rays with thine;
9592,--VIRG.,"E'en I, by far the meanest of your age,"
9593,--VIRG.,Shall not repent my passion for the stage.
9594,--VIRG.,"Thus did the will almighty disallow,"
9595,--VIRG.,"No human force could pluck the golden bough,"
9596,--VIRG.,"Which left the tree with ease at Jove's command,"
9597,--VIRG.,And spar'd the labour of the weakest hand.
9598,--VIRG.,Auspicious fate! that gives me leave to write
9599,--VIRG.,"To you, the muses' glory and delight;"
9600,--VIRG.,"Who know to read, nor false encomiums raise,"
9601,--VIRG.,And mortify an author with your praise:
9602,--VIRG.,"Praise wounds a noble mind, when 'tis not due,"
9603,--VIRG.,"But censure's self will please, my lord, from you;"
9604,--VIRG.,"Faults are our pride and gain, when you descend"
9605,--VIRG.,"To point them out, and teach us how to mend."
9606,--VIRG.,"What though the great man set his coffers wide,"
9607,--VIRG.,That cannot gratify the poet's pride;
9608,--VIRG.,"Whose inspiration, if 'tis truly good,"
9609,--VIRG.,"Is best rewarded, when best understood."
9610,--VIRG.,"The muses write for glory, not for gold,"
9611,--VIRG.,'Tis far beneath their nature to be sold:
9612,--VIRG.,"The greatest gain is scorn'd, but as it serves"
9613,--VIRG.,To speak a sense of what the muse deserves;
9614,--VIRG.,"The muse which from her Lansdowne fears no wrong,"
9615,--VIRG.,"Best judge, as well as subject, of her song."
9616,--VIRG.,"Should this great theme allure me further still,"
9617,--VIRG.,"And I presume to use your patience ill,"
9618,--VIRG.,"The world would plead my cause, and none but you"
9619,--VIRG.,Will take disgust at what I now pursue:
9620,--VIRG.,"Since what is mean my muse can't raise, I'll choose"
9621,--VIRG.,A theme that's able to exalt my muse.
9622,--VIRG.,"For who, not void of thought, can Granville name,"
9623,--VIRG.,Without a spark of his immortal flame?
9624,--VIRG.,"Whether we seek the patriot, or the friend,"
9625,--VIRG.,"Let Bolingbroke, let Anna recommend;"
9626,--VIRG.,"Whether we choose to love or to admire,"
9627,--VIRG.,"You melt the tender, and th'ambitious fire."
9628,--VIRG.,"Such native graces without thought abound,"
9629,--VIRG.,"And such familiar glories spread around,"
9630,--VIRG.,As more incline the stander by to raise
9631,--VIRG.,"His value for himself, than you to praise."
9632,--VIRG.,"Thus you befriend the most heroic way,"
9633,--VIRG.,"Bless all, on none an obligation lay;"
9634,--VIRG.,"So turn'd by nature's hand for all that's well,"
9635,--VIRG.,'Tis scarce a virtue when you most excel.
9636,--VIRG.,"Tho' sweet your presence, graceful is your mien,"
9637,--VIRG.,You to be happy want not to be seen;
9638,--VIRG.,"Though priz'd in public, you can smile alone,"
9639,--VIRG.,Nor court an approbation but your own:
9640,--VIRG.,"In throngs, not conscious of those eyes that gaze"
9641,--VIRG.,"In wonder fix'd, though resolute to please;"
9642,--VIRG.,"You, were all blind, would still deserve applause;"
9643,--VIRG.,"The world's your glory's witness, not its cause;"
9644,--VIRG.,"That lies beyond the limits of the day,"
9645,--VIRG.,"Angels behold it, and their God obey."
9646,--VIRG.,You take delight in others' excellence;
9647,--VIRG.,"A gift, which nature rarely does dispense:"
9648,--VIRG.,"Of all that breathe 'tis you, perhaps, alone"
9649,--VIRG.,Would be well pleas'd to see yourself outdone.
9650,--VIRG.,"You wish not those, who show your name respect,"
9651,--VIRG.,"So little worth, as might excuse neglect;"
9652,--VIRG.,Nor are in pain lest merit you should know;
9653,--VIRG.,Nor shun the well deserver as a foe;
9654,--VIRG.,"A troublesome acquaintance, that will claim"
9655,--VIRG.,"To be well us'd, or dye your cheek with shame."
9656,--VIRG.,You wish your country's good; that told so well
9657,--VIRG.,"Your powers are known, th' event I need not tell."
9658,--VIRG.,"When Nestor spoke, none ask'd if he prevail'd;"
9659,--VIRG.,That god of sweet persuasion never fail'd:
9660,--VIRG.,"And such great fame had Hector's valour wrought,"
9661,--VIRG.,"Who meant he conquer'd, only said he fought."
9662,--VIRG.,"When you, my lord, to sylvan scenes retreat,"
9663,--VIRG.,"No crowds around for pleasure, or for state,"
9664,--VIRG.,"You are not cast upon a stranger land,"
9665,--VIRG.,And wander pensive o'er the barren strand;
9666,--VIRG.,"Nor are you by receiv'd example taught,"
9667,--VIRG.,In toys to shun the discipline of thought;
9668,--VIRG.,"But unconfin'd by bounds of time and place,"
9669,--VIRG.,You choose companions from all human race;
9670,--VIRG.,"Converse with those the deluge swept away,"
9671,--VIRG.,Or those whose midnight is Britannia's day.
9672,--VIRG.,"Books not so much inform, as give consent"
9673,--VIRG.,To those ideas your own thoughts present;
9674,--VIRG.,"Your only gain from turning volumes o'er,"
9675,--VIRG.,Is finding cause to like yourself the more:
9676,--VIRG.,In Grecian sages you are only taught
9677,--VIRG.,With more respect to value your own thought:
9678,--VIRG.,"Great Tully grew immortal, while he drew"
9679,--VIRG.,Those precepts we behold alive in you:
9680,--VIRG.,"Your life is so adjusted to their schools,"
9681,--VIRG.,It makes that history they meant for rules.
9682,--VIRG.,"What joy, what pleasing transport, must arise"
9683,--VIRG.,"Within your breast, and lift you to the skies,"
9684,--VIRG.,"When, in each learned page that you unfold,"
9685,--VIRG.,You find some part of your own conduct told!
9686,--VIRG.,"So pleas'd, and so surpris'd, Æneas stood,"
9687,--VIRG.,"And such triumphant raptures fir'd his blood,"
9688,--VIRG.,When far from Trojan shores the hero spied
9689,--VIRG.,His story shining forth in all its pride;
9690,--VIRG.,"Admir'd himself, and saw his actions stand"
9691,--VIRG.,The praise and wonder of a foreign land.
9692,--VIRG.,"He knows not half his being, who's confin'd"
9693,--VIRG.,"In converse, and reflection on mankind:"
9694,--VIRG.,"Your soul, which understands her charter well,"
9695,--VIRG.,Disdains imprison'd by those skies to dwell;
9696,--VIRG.,Ranges eternity without the leave
9697,--VIRG.,"Of death, nor waits the passage of the grave."
9698,--VIRG.,"When pains eternal, and eternal bliss,"
9699,--VIRG.,"When these high cares your weary thoughts dismiss,"
9700,--VIRG.,"In heavenly numbers you your soul unbend,"
9701,--VIRG.,And for your ease to deathless fame descend.
9702,--VIRG.,"Ye kings! would ye true greatness understand,"
9703,--VIRG.,Read Seneca grown rich in Granville's hand.(63)
9704,--VIRG.,Behold the glories of your life complete!
9705,--VIRG.,"Still at a flow, and permanently great;"
9706,--VIRG.,"New moments shed new pleasures as they fly,"
9707,--VIRG.,"And yet your greatest is, that you must die."
9708,--VIRG.,"Thus Anna saw, and rais'd you to the seat"
9709,--VIRG.,"Of honour, and confess'd her servant great;"
9710,--VIRG.,"Confess'd, not made him such; for faithful fame"
9711,--VIRG.,Her trumpet swell'd long since with Granville's name;
9712,--VIRG.,"Though you in modesty the title wear,"
9713,--VIRG.,Your name shall be the title of your heir;
9714,--VIRG.,"Farther than ermine, make his glory known,"
9715,--VIRG.,And cast in shades the favour of a throne.
9716,--VIRG.,From thrones the beam of high distinction springs;
9717,--VIRG.,"The soul's endowments from the King of kings,"
9718,--VIRG.,Lo! one great day calls forth ten mighty peers!
9719,--VIRG.,Produce ten Granvilles in five thousand years;
9720,--VIRG.,"Anna, be thou content to fix the fate"
9721,--VIRG.,"Of various kingdoms, and control the great;"
9722,--VIRG.,But O! to bid thy Granville brighter shine!
9723,--VIRG.,"To him that great prerogative resign,"
9724,--VIRG.,"Who the sun's height can raise at pleasure higher,"
9725,--VIRG.,"His lamp illumine, set his flames on fire."
9726,--VIRG.,"Yet still one bliss, one glory, I forbear,"
9727,--VIRG.,A darling friend whom near your heart you wear;
9728,--VIRG.,"That lovely youth, my lord, whom you must blame,"
9729,--VIRG.,That I grow thus familiar with your name.
9730,--VIRG.,"He's friendly, open, in his conduct nice,"
9731,--VIRG.,Nor serve these virtues to atone for vice:
9732,--VIRG.,"Vice has he none, or such as none wish less,"
9733,--VIRG.,"But friends indeed, good-nature in excess."
9734,--VIRG.,"You cannot boast the merit of a choice,"
9735,--VIRG.,"In making him your own, 'twas nature's voice,"
9736,--VIRG.,"Which call'd too loud by man to be withstood,"
9737,--VIRG.,Pleading a tie far nearer than of blood;
9738,--VIRG.,"Similitude of manners, such a mind"
9739,--VIRG.,As makes you less the wonder of mankind.
9740,--VIRG.,"Such ease his common converse recommends,"
9741,--VIRG.,"As he ne'er felt a passion, but his friend's;"
9742,--VIRG.,"Yet fix'd his principles, beyond the force"
9743,--VIRG.,"Of all beneath the sun, to bend his course.(64)"
9744,--VIRG.,"Thus the tall cedar, beautiful and fair,"
9745,--VIRG.,Flatters the motions of the wanton air;
9746,--VIRG.,Salutes each passing breeze with head reclin'd:
9747,--VIRG.,The pliant branches dance in every wind:
9748,--VIRG.,"But fix'd the stem her upright state maintains,"
9749,--VIRG.,And all the fury of the north disdains.
9750,--VIRG.,How are you bless'd in such a matchless friend!
9751,--VIRG.,Alas! with me the joys of friendship end;
9752,--VIRG.,"O Harrison! I must, I will complain;"
9753,--VIRG.,"Tears soothe the soul's distress, tho' shed in vain;"
9754,--VIRG.,"Didst thou return, and bless thy native shore"
9755,--VIRG.,"With welcome peace, and is my friend no more?--"
9756,--VIRG.,"Thy task was early done, and I must own"
9757,--VIRG.,"Death kind to thee, but ah! to thee alone."
9758,--VIRG.,"But 'tis in me a vanity to mourn,"
9759,--VIRG.,The sorrows of the great thy tomb adorn;
9760,--VIRG.,"Strafford and Bolingbroke the loss perceive,"
9761,--VIRG.,"They grieve, and make thee envied in thy grave."
9762,--VIRG.,"With aching heart, and a foreboding mind,"
9763,--VIRG.,"I night to day in painful journey join'd,"
9764,--VIRG.,When first inform'd of his approaching fate;
9765,--VIRG.,But reach'd the partner of my soul too late:
9766,--VIRG.,"'Twas past, his cheek was cold; that tuneful tongue,"
9767,--VIRG.,"Which Isis charm'd with its melodious song,"
9768,--VIRG.,"Now languish'd, wanted strength to speak his pain,"
9769,--VIRG.,"Scarce rais'd a feeble groan, and sunk again:"
9770,--VIRG.,"Each art of life, in which he bore a part,"
9771,--VIRG.,Shot like an arrow through my bleeding heart.
9772,--VIRG.,"To what serv'd all his promis'd wealth and power,"
9773,--VIRG.,But more to load that most unhappy hour?
9774,--VIRG.,Yet still prevail'd the greatness of his mind;
9775,--VIRG.,"That, not in health, or life itself confin'd,"
9776,--VIRG.,"Felt through his mortal pangs Britannia's peace,"
9777,--VIRG.,"Mounted to joy, and smil'd in death's embrace."
9778,--VIRG.,"His spirit now just ready to resign,"
9779,--VIRG.,"No longer now his own, no longer mine,"
9780,--VIRG.,"He grasps my hand, his swimming eyeballs roll,"
9781,--VIRG.,"My hand he grasps, and enters in my soul:"
9782,--VIRG.,"Then with a groan--Support me, O! beware"
9783,--VIRG.,"Of holding worth, however great, too dear!(65)"
9784,--VIRG.,"Pardon, my lord, the privilege of grief,"
9785,--VIRG.,That in untimely freedom seeks relief;
9786,--VIRG.,"To better fate your love I recommend,"
9787,--VIRG.,O! may you never lose so dear a friend!
9788,--VIRG.,May nothing interrupt your happy hours;
9789,--VIRG.,Enjoy the blessings peace on Europe showers:
9790,--VIRG.,Nor yet disdain those blessings to adorn;
9791,--VIRG.,"To make the muse immortal, you was born."
9792,--VIRG.,"Sing; and in latest time, when story's dark,"
9793,--VIRG.,This period your surviving fame shall mark;
9794,--VIRG.,"Save from the gulf of years this glorious age,"
9795,--VIRG.,And thus illustrate their historian's page.
9796,--VIRG.,"The crown of Spain in doubtful balance hung,"
9797,--VIRG.,"And Anna Britain sway'd, when Granville sung:"
9798,--VIRG.,"That noted year Europa sheath'd her sword,"
9799,--VIRG.,When this great man was first saluted lord.

9864,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"For bankrupts write, when ruin'd shops are shut,"
9865,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,As maggots crawl from out a perish'd nut.
9866,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"His hammer this, and that his trowel quits,"
9867,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And, wanting sense for tradesmen, serve for wits."
9868,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,By thriving men subsists each other trade;

9880,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Their heavy prose our injur'd reason tires;

9886,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"One loses his estate, and down he sits,"

9888,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Another marries, and his dear proves keen;"
9889,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,He writes as an hypnotic for the spleen:
9890,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Some write, confin'd by physic; some, by debt;"

9894,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Another writes because his father writ,"

9896,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Has Lico learning, humour, thought profound?"
9897,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Neither: why write then? He wants twenty pound:
9898,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"His belly, not his brains, this impulse give;"
9899,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,He'll grow immortal; for he cannot live:

9902,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Perhaps a title has his fancy smit,"
9903,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Or a quaint motto, which he thinks has wit:"

9914,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"So sounds spontaneous from the sibyl broke,"

10132,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,
10133,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,From Oxford.
10134,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,
10135,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,
10136,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,All write at London; shall the rage abate
10137,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Here, where it most should shine, the muses' seat?"
10138,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Where, mortal or immortal, as they please,"
10139,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The learn'd may choose eternity, or ease?"
10140,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Has not a (66)royal patron wisely strove
10141,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,To woo the muse in her Athenian grove?
10142,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Added new strings to her harmonious shell,"
10143,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And given new tongues to those who spoke so well?
10144,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Let these instruct, with truth's illustrious ray,"
10145,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Awake the world, and scare our owls away."
10146,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Meanwhile, O friend! indulge me, if I give"
10147,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Some needful precepts how to write, and live!"
10148,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Serious should be an author's final views;
10149,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Who write for pure amusement, ne'er amuse."
10150,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,An author! 'tis a venerable name!
10151,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"How few deserve it, and what numbers claim!"
10152,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Unblest with sense above their peers refin'd,"
10153,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Who shall stand up, dictators to mankind?"
10154,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Nay, who dare shine, if not in virtue's cause?"
10155,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,That sole proprietor of just applause.
10156,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Ye restless men, who pant for letter'd praise,"
10157,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,With whom would you consult to gain the bays?--
10158,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,With those great authors whose fam'd works you read?
10159,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"'Tis well: go, then, consult the laurell'd shade."
10160,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,What answer will the laurell'd shade return?
10161,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Hear it, and tremble! he commands you burn"
10162,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The noblest works his envied genius writ,"
10163,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,That boast of nought more excellent than wit.
10164,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"If this be true, as 'tis a truth most dread,"
10165,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Woe to the page which has not that to plead!
10166,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Fontaine and Chaucer, dying, wish'd unwrote,"
10167,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,The sprightliest efforts of their wanton thought:
10168,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Sidney and Waller, brightest sons of fame,"
10169,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Condemn the charm of ages to the flame:
10170,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And in one point is all true wisdom cast,"
10171,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,To think that early we must think at last.
10172,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Immortal wits, ev'n dead, break nature's laws,"
10173,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Injurious still to virtue's sacred cause;
10174,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And their guilt growing, as their bodies rot,"
10175,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,(Revers'd ambition!) pant to be forgot.
10176,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Thus ends your courted fame: does lucre then,"
10177,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The sacred thirst of gold, betray your pen?"
10178,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"In prose 'tis blameable, in verse 'tis worse,"
10179,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Provokes the muse, extorts Apollo's curse:"
10180,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,His sacred influence never should be sold:
10181,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,'Tis arrant simony to sing for gold:
10182,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,'Tis immortality should fire your mind;
10183,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Scorn a less paymaster than all mankind.
10184,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"If bribes you seek, know this, ye writing tribe!"
10185,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Who writes for virtue has the largest bribe:
10186,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,All's on the party of the virtuous man;
10187,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The good will surely serve him, if they can;"
10188,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The bad, when interest, or ambition guide,"
10189,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And 'tis at once their interest and their pride:
10190,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"But should both fail to take him to their care,"
10191,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"He boasts a greater friend, and both may spare."
10192,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Letters to man uncommon light dispense;
10193,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And what is virtue, but superior sense?"
10194,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"In parts and learning you who place your pride,"
10195,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Your faults are crimes, your crimes are double dyed."
10196,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"What is a scandal of the first renown,"
10197,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"But letter'd knaves, and atheists in a gown?"
10198,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,'Tis harder far to please than give offence;
10199,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,The least misconduct damns the brightest sense;
10200,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Each shallow pate, that cannot read your name,"
10201,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Can read your life, and will be proud to blame."
10202,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Flagitious manners make impressions deep
10203,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"On those, that o'er a page of Milton sleep:"
10204,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Nor in their dulness think to save your shame,"
10205,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"True, these are fools; but wise men say the same."
10206,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Wits are a despicable race of men,"
10207,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,If they confine their talents to the pen;
10208,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"When the man shocks us, while the writer shines,"
10209,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Our scorn in life, our envy in his lines."
10210,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Yet, proud of parts, with prudence some dispense,"
10211,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And play the fool, because they're men of sense."
10212,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"What instances bleed recent in each thought,"
10213,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Of men to ruin by their genius brought!
10214,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Against their wills what numbers ruin shun,"
10215,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Purely through want of wit to be undone!
10216,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Nature has shown, by making it so rare,"
10217,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,That wit's a jewel which we need not wear.
10218,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Of plain sound sense life's current coin is made;
10219,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,With that we drive the most substantial trade.
10220,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Prudence protects and guides us; wit betrays;
10221,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,A splendid source of ill ten thousand ways;
10222,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,A certain snare to miseries immense;
10223,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,A gay prerogative from common sense;
10224,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Unless strong judgment that wild thing can tame,"
10225,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And break to paths of virtue and of fame.
10226,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"But grant your judgment equal to the best,"
10227,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Sense fills your head, and genius fires your breast;"
10228,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Yet still forbear: your wit (consider well)
10229,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"'Tis great to show, but greater to conceal;"
10230,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,As it is great to seize the golden prize
10231,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Of place or power; but greater to despise.
10232,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"If still you languish for an author's name,"
10233,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Think private merit less than public fame,"
10234,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And fancy not to write is not to live;
10235,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Deserve, and take, the great prerogative."
10236,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"But ponder what it is; how dear 'twill cost,"
10237,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,To write one page which you may justly boast.
10238,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Sense may be good, yet not deserve the press;"
10239,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Who write, an awful character profess;"
10240,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The world as pupil of their wisdom claim,"
10241,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And for their stipend an immortal fame:
10242,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Nothing but what is solid or refin'd,"
10243,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Should dare ask public audience of mankind.
10244,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Severely weigh your learning, and your wit:"
10245,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Keep down your pride by what is nobly writ:
10246,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"No writer, fam'd in your own way, pass o'er;"
10247,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Much trust example, but reflection more:"
10248,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"More had the ancients writ, they more had taught;"
10249,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Which shows some work is left for modern thought.
10250,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"This weigh'd, perfection know; and known, adore;"
10251,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Toil, burn for that; but do not aim at more;"
10252,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Above, beneath it, the just limits fix;"
10253,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And zealously prefer four lines to six.
10254,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Write, and re-write, blot out, and write again,"
10255,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And for its swiftness ne'er applaud your pen.
10256,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Leave to the jockeys that Newmarket praise,"
10257,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Slow runs the Pegasus that wins the bays.
10258,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Much time for immortality to pay,"
10259,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Is just and wise; for less is thrown away.
10260,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Time only can mature the labouring brain;
10261,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Time is the father, and the midwife pain:"
10262,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The same good sense that makes a man excel,"
10263,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Still makes him doubt he ne'er has written well.
10264,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Downright impossibilities they seek;
10265,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,What man can be immortal in a week?
10266,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Excuse no fault; though beautiful, 'twill harm;"
10267,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,One fault shocks more than twenty beauties charm.
10268,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Our age demands correctness; Addison
10269,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And you this commendable hurt have done.
10270,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Now writers find, as once Achilles found,"
10271,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The whole is mortal, if a part's unsound."
10272,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"He that strikes out, and strikes not out the best,"
10273,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Pours lustre in, and dignifies the rest:"
10274,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Give e'er so little, if what's right be there,"
10275,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"We praise for what you burn, and what you spare:"
10276,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"The part you burn, smells sweet before the shrine,"
10277,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And is as incense to the part divine.
10278,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Nor frequent write, though you can do it well;"
10279,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Men may too oft, though not too much, excel."
10280,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,A few good works gain fame; more sink their price;
10281,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Mankind are fickle, and hate paying twice:"
10282,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"They granted you writ well, what can they more,"
10283,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Unless you let them praise for giving o'er?
10284,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Do boldly what you do, and let your page"
10285,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Smile, if it smiles, and if it rages, rage."
10286,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"So faintly Lucius censures and commends,"
10287,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"That Lucius has no foes, except his friends."
10288,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Let satire less engage you than applause;
10289,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,It shows a gen'rous mind to wink at flaws:
10290,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Is genius yours? be yours a glorious end,"
10291,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Be your king's, country's, truth's, religion's friend;"
10292,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,The public glory by your own beget;
10293,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Run nations, run posterity, in debt."
10294,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And since the fam'd alone make others live,"
10295,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,First have that glory you presume to give.
10296,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"If satire charms, strike faults, but spare the man"
10297,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,'Tis dull to be as witty as you can.
10298,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Satire recoils whenever charg'd too high;
10299,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Round your own fame the fatal splinters fly.
10300,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"As the soft plume gives swiftness to the dart,"
10301,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Good breeding sends the satire to the heart.
10302,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Painters and surgeons may the structure scan;
10303,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Genius and morals be with you the man:
10304,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Defaults in those alone should give offence!
10305,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Who strikes the person, pleads his innocence."
10306,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,My narrow minded satire can't extend
10307,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,To Codrus' form; I'm not so much his friend:
10308,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Himself should publish that (the world agree)
10309,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Before his works, or in the pillory."
10310,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Let him be black, fair, tall, short, thin, or fat,"
10311,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Dirty or clean, I find no theme in that."
10312,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Is that call'd humour? It has this pretence,"
10313,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"'Tis neither virtue, breeding, wit, or sense."
10314,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Unless you boast the genius of a Swift,"
10315,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Beware of humour, the dull rogue's last shift."
10316,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Can others write like you? Your task give o'er,"
10317,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,'Tis printing what was publish'd long before.
10318,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"If nought peculiar through your labours run,"
10319,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"They're duplicates, and twenty are but one."
10320,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Think frequently, think close, read nature, turn"
10321,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Men's manners o'er, and half your volumes burn;"
10322,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"To nurse with quick reflection be your strife,"
10323,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Thoughts born from present objects, warm from life:"
10324,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"When most unsought, such inspirations rise,"
10325,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Slighted by fools, and cherish'd by the wise:"
10326,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Expect peculiar fame from these alone;
10327,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"These make an author, these are all your own."
10328,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Life, like their Bibles, coolly men turn o'er;"
10329,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Hence unexperienc'd children of threescore.
10330,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"True, all men think of course, as all men dream;"
10331,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And if they slightly think, 'tis much the same."
10332,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Letters admit not of a half renown;
10333,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"They give you nothing, or they give a crown."
10334,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"No work e'er gain'd true fame, or ever can,"
10335,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,But what did honour to the name of man.
10336,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Weighty the subject, cogent the discourse,"
10337,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Clear be the style, the very sound of force;"
10338,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Easy the conduct, simple the design,"
10339,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Striking the moral, and the soul divine:"
10340,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Let nature art, and judgment wit, exceed;"
10341,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"O'er learning reason reign; o'er that, your creed:"
10342,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Thus virtue's seeds, at once, and laurel's, grow;"
10343,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Do thus, and rise a Pope, or a Despreau:"
10344,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And when your genius exquisitely shines,"
10345,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Live up to the full lustre of your lines:
10346,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Parts but expose those men who virtue quit;
10347,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,A fallen angel is a fallen wit;
10348,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"And they plead Lucifer's detested cause,"
10349,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Who for bare talents challenge our applause.
10350,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Would you restore just honours to the pen?
10351,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,From able writers rise to worthy men.
10352,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"""Who's this with nonsense, nonsense would restrain?"
10353,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Who's this (they cry) so vainly schools the vain?
10354,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Who damns our trash, with so much trash replete?"
10355,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"As, three ells round, huge Cheyne rails at meat?"""
10356,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Shall I with Bavius then my voice exalt,"
10357,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And challenge all mankind to find one fault?
10358,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"With huge examens overwhelm my page,"
10359,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And darken reason with dogmatic rage?
10360,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"As if, one tedious volume writ in rhyme,"
10361,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,In prose a duller could excuse the crime:
10362,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Sure, next to writing, the most idle thing"
10363,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Is gravely to harangue on what we sing.
10364,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"At that tribunal stands the writing tribe,"
10365,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Which nothing can intimidate or bribe:
10366,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Time is the judge; time has nor friend nor foe;
10367,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"False fame must wither, and the true will grow."
10368,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Arm'd with this truth, all critics I defy;"
10369,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"For if I fall, by my own pen I die;"
10370,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,While snarlers strive with proud but fruitless pain
10371,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"To wound immortals, or to slay the slain."
10372,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Sore prest with danger, and in awful dread"
10373,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Of twenty pamphlets levell'd at my head,"
10374,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Thus have I forg'd a buckler in my brain,"
10375,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Of recent form, to serve me this campaign:"
10376,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,And safely hope to quit the dreadful field
10377,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Delug'd with ink, and sleep behind my shield;"
10378,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,Unless dire Codrus rouses to the fray
10379,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"In all his might, and damns me--for a day."
10380,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"As turns a flock of geese, and, on the green,"
10381,TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE,"Poke out their foolish necks in awkward spleen,"

10758,FOOTNOTES,25 It is disputed amongst the critics who was the author of the book of

10760,FOOTNOTES,"little performance, some arguments occurred to me which favour the"

10763,FOOTNOTES,
10764,FOOTNOTES,"26 The Almighty's speech, chapter xxxviii. &c. which is what I"
10765,FOOTNOTES,"paraphrase in this little work, is by much the finest part of the"
10766,FOOTNOTES,"noblest and most ancient poem in the world. Bishop Patrick says, its"
10767,FOOTNOTES,"grandeur is as much above all other poetry, as thunder is louder"
10768,FOOTNOTES,than a whisper. In order to set this distinguished part of the poem
10769,FOOTNOTES,"in a fuller light, and give the reader a clearer conception of it, I"
10770,FOOTNOTES,"have abridged the preceding and subsequent parts of the poem, and"
10771,FOOTNOTES,joined them to it; so that this piece is a sort of an epitome of the
10772,FOOTNOTES,whole book of Job.

10783,FOOTNOTES,"Longinus has a chapter on interrogations, which shows that they"

10791,FOOTNOTES,"27 The book of Job is well known to be dramatic, and, like the"

10804,FOOTNOTES,"to find it like a managed horse, raging, tossing, and foaming, but"

10806,FOOTNOTES,"sublimity to that of ""Let there be light,"" &c., so much only as the"

10944,FOOTNOTES,"this passage, though no commentator, I have seen, mentions it. It is"
10945,FOOTNOTES,easy to conceive how the Egyptians should be both readers and
10946,FOOTNOTES,"admirers of the writings of Moses, whom I suppose the author of this"
10947,FOOTNOTES,poem.
10948,FOOTNOTES,
10949,FOOTNOTES,I have observed already that three or four of the creatures here
10950,FOOTNOTES,"described are Egyptian; the two last are notoriously so, they are"
10951,FOOTNOTES,"the river-horse and the crocodile, those celebrated inhabitants of"
10952,FOOTNOTES,the Nile; and on these two it is that our author chiefly dwells. It
10953,FOOTNOTES,would have been expected from an author more remote from that river
10954,FOOTNOTES,"than Moses, in a catalogue of creatures produced to magnify their"
10955,FOOTNOTES,"Creator, to have dwelt on the two largest works of his hand, viz."
10956,FOOTNOTES,"the elephant and the whale. This is so natural an expectation, that"
10957,FOOTNOTES,"some commentators have rendered behemoth and leviathan, the elephant"
10958,FOOTNOTES,"and whale, though the descriptions in our author will not admit of"
10959,FOOTNOTES,"it; but Moses being, as we may well suppose, under an immediate"
10960,FOOTNOTES,"terror of the hippopotamus and crocodile, from their daily mischiefs"
10961,FOOTNOTES,"and ravages around him, it is very accountable why he should permit"

10970,FOOTNOTES,he was appointed to the command of his majesty's ship the Ludlow
