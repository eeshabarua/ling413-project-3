51,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
52,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
53,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,The fate which usually attends political and satirical writings that owe
54,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"their origin to passing events, has in no way affected the POETRY OF THE"
55,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"ANTI-JACOBIN, which, after a lapse of more than ninety years, still"
56,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"continues to interest and amuse. Public opinion never fails, sooner or"
57,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"later, to arrive at a just conclusion as to the merits both of"
58,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,individuals and actions; and though it may often neglect to preserve a
59,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"meritorious work, never perpetuates a worthless one. Poetry which lashed"
60,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"with so remorseless a hand the patriotic proceedings, and held up to"
61,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"ridicule the persons and habits, of the most distinguished Whig leaders,"
62,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,must have possessed no common merit to have won the encomiums of such
63,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"liberal politicians and such critics as MACKINTOSH and JEFFREY, MOORE"
64,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,and BYRON.
65,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
66,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"MOORE, in his _Life of Sheridan_, observes: “_The Rolliad_ and _The"
67,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Anti-Jacobin_ may, on their respective sides of the question, be"
68,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,considered as models of that style of political satire whose lightness
69,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,and vivacity give it the appearance of proceeding rather from the
70,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"wantonness of wit than of ill-nature, and whose very malice, from the"
71,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"fancy with which it is mixed up, like certain kinds of fire-works,"
72,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,explodes in sparkles”. This criticism might be applied to some of his
73,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,own political squibs.
74,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
75,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"As the poems refer to occurrences long since past, a rapid glance at the"
76,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,state of events at that time (1797–8) may render them more intelligible
77,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,to the generality of readers.
78,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
79,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,The affairs of England were then in a critical position. The ministry of
80,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"PITT was carrying on a fierce war with republican France, the necessity"
81,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,for which had split the public into two great parties. The liberal party
82,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"alleged, that “the whole misfortunes of Europe and all the crimes of"
83,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,France had arisen from the iniquitous coalition of kings to overturn its
84,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"infant freedom;—that, if its government had been left alone, it would"
85,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,neither have stained its hands with innocent blood at home nor pursued
86,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"plans of aggrandizement abroad; and that the Republic, relieved from the"
87,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"pressure of external danger, and no longer roused by the call of"
88,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"patriotic duty, would have quietly turned its swords into pruning-hooks,"
89,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"and, renouncing the allurements of foreign conquests, thought only of"
90,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,promoting the internal felicity of its citizens”.
91,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
92,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"These sentiments, though supported by the extraordinary eloquence of"
93,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"FOX, SHERIDAN, ERSKINE, and others, had but little weight with the"
94,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,minister or the great body of the public. It was impossible to deny that
95,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the power of the French Republic was daily increasing, and threatened"
96,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,the subjugation of the greater part of Europe. BUONAPARTE had overrun
97,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Italy, and broken the power of Austria, which, by the treaty of Leoben,"
98,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"was compelled to cede the Netherlands to France, allow the free"
99,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"navigation of the Rhine, and recognise the independence of the"
100,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"newly-erected Italian republics. Spain, also, had declared war against"
101,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Britain, which was thus left to contend singly against the power of"
102,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,France; for the Directory had refused the basis of peace proposed by
103,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"LORD MALMESBURY, that of a mutual restitution of conquests. To add to"
104,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"these embarrassments, during the year 1797 credit became affected, and"
105,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,the Bank of England suspended cash payments; mutinies broke out in the
106,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,fleets at Spithead and the Nore; and Ireland was on the verge of
107,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"rebellion. But the talents of PITT were equal to the occasion, and his"
108,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"power rose higher than ever, when his prognostications were shortly"
109,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"after (in December, 1797) confirmed by the unprovoked attack upon"
110,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,Switzerland by the French. The impolicy of this proceeding was equal to
111,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,its infamy; for nothing ever done by the revolutionary government
112,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"contributed so powerfully to cool the ardour of its partisans in Europe,"
113,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,and to open the eyes of the intelligent and respectable classes in every
114,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,other country to its ultimate designs. Its effect on the friends of
115,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,freedom in England may be judged of from the indignant protest of SIR
116,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"JAMES MACKINTOSH, himself once a warm admirer of the French Revolution,"
117,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"who, in his defence of JEAN PELTIER, in 1803, for a libel on BUONAPARTE,"
118,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"declared, “the invasion and destruction of Switzerland an act, in"
119,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,comparison with which all the deeds of rapine and blood perpetrated in
120,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the world are innocence itself”. Even before this, the true character of"
121,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the revolution had been detected by the democratic COLERIDGE, who gave"
122,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,public utterance to his feelings of horror and disgust in that noble
123,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"_Ode to France_ written in February, 1797. In a word, to say nothing of"
124,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"her other conquests, France, at the beginning of 1798, had three"
125,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"affiliated republics at her side, the Batavian, Cisalpine, and the"
126,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Ligurian; before its close she had organized three more, the Helvetic,"
127,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the Roman, and the Parthenopeian."
128,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
129,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,PITT’S influence was further increased by the threatened invasion of
130,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Great Britain by the French, a proceeding which, as it affected every"
131,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"class in the country, raised the national enthusiasm to the highest"
132,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"pitch, inflamed as it already was by the recent glorious victories off"
133,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,Cape St. Vincent and Camperdown. That they were likely to be in earnest
134,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,had been already shown by their expeditions to Bantry Bay and
135,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Pembrokeshire, and BUONAPARTE’S boast at Geneva, that “he would"
136,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"democratize England in three months,” proved how much he relied upon the"
137,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,support of the malcontents both in Great Britain and Ireland. The
138,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"estimates and preparations for defence were, enormous; taxes, to an"
139,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"extent utterly unknown before, were laid on; the Volunteer Bill was"
140,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"passed (SHERIDAN assisting), by which, in addition to the regular army,"
141,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"a hundred and fifty thousand volunteers were, in a few weeks, in arms;"
142,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"THE KING was authorized by another bill, in the event of an invasion, to"
143,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"call out the levy, _en masse_, of the population; the Alien Bill was"
144,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,reenacted; and the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act continued for
145,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,another year.
146,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
147,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"But the genius of one man, however great, can effect but little, unless"
148,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,suitably supported by others. The sagacious mind of PITT had long seen
149,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"that his party in Parliament were, with very few exceptions, no match"
150,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"for his numerous opponents, powerful both in talent and social position;"
151,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"among whom were FOX, SHERIDAN, ERSKINE, HORNE TOOKE, WHITBREAD,"
152,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"NICHOLLS, COURTENAY, FITZPATRICK, the DUKES of NORFOLK and BEDFORD, LORD"
153,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"STANHOPE, the DUCHESS of DEVONSHIRE, and others. He was always anxious,"
154,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"therefore, to secure whatever available talent presented itself, and"
155,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"immediately on their appearance enlisted under his banners CANNING,"
156,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"JENKINSON, HUSKISSON, and CASTLEREAGH, all men of the same standing, for"
157,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the first three were born in 1770, and the last in 1769."
158,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
159,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"The important assistance of CANNING was immediately felt, for he was, in"
160,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the words of BYRON, “a genius—almost a universal one; an orator, a wit,"
161,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"a poet, a statesman”. Though he entered Parliament at the early age of"
162,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"23 (in 1793), and attained the post of Under-Secretary of State for the"
163,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Foreign Department two years after, he was by no means inexperienced"
164,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,either as a writer or as an orator; for while a student at Eton he had
165,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"won distinction by his contributions to _The Microcosm_, a weekly paper"
166,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"published by the more advanced Etonians, and also in the discussions of"
167,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"their Debating Society, which were conducted with strict regard to"
168,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"parliamentary usages. And afterwards, while studying for the law, he"
169,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,took an active part in the proceedings of the debating societies of the
170,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"metropolis, in which he achieved so much reputation as to lead to his"
171,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"introduction to PITT, whose party he unhesitatingly joined."
172,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
173,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,CANNING early saw the necessity of the Government’s possessing some
174,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"literary engine, which, like the Whig _Rolliad_, published some years"
175,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"before, should carry confusion into the ranks of its enemies. In a lucky"
176,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"hour he conceived the idea of _The Anti-Jacobin_, a weekly newspaper,"
177,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"interspersed with poetry, the avowed object of which was to expose the"
178,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"vicious doctrines of the French Revolution, and to turn into ridicule"
179,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"and contempt the advocates of that event, and the sticklers for peace"
180,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"and parliamentary reform. The editor was WILLIAM GIFFORD, whose vigorous"
181,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,and unscrupulous pen had been already shown in his _Baviad_ and
182,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"_Mæviad_; and among the regular writers were: JOHN HOOKHAM FRERE,"
183,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"JENKINSON (afterwards EARL OF LIVERPOOL), GEORGE ELLIS (who had"
184,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"previously contributed to the Whig _Rolliad_), LORD CLARE, LORD"
185,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"MORNINGTON (afterwards MARQUIS WELLESLEY), LORD MORPETH (afterwards EARL"
186,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"OF CARLISLE), BARON MACDONALD, and others. These gentlemen entered upon"
187,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,their task with no common spirit. Their purpose was to blacken their
188,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"adversaries, and they spared no means, fair or foul, in the attempt."
189,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Their most distinguished countrymen, whose only fault was their being"
190,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"opposed to government, were treated with no more respect than their"
191,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"foreign adversaries, and were held up to public execration as traitors,"
192,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"blasphemers, and debauchees. So alarmed, however, became WILBERFORCE and"
193,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,others of the more moderate supporters of ministers at the boldness of
194,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the language employed, that PITT was induced to interfere, and, after an"
195,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"existence of eight months, _The Anti-Jacobin_ (in its original form)"
196,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,ceased to exist.
197,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
198,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,_The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin_ is not exclusively political. _The
199,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"Loves of the Triangles_, a parody on DR. DARWIN’S _Loves of the Plants_,"
200,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"is, in the opinion of a celebrated critic (Lord Jeffrey) of the highest"
201,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"degree of merit; as is also _The Progress of Man_, a parody on PAYNE"
202,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"KNIGHT’S _Progress of Civil Society_; and _The Rovers_, a burlesque on"
203,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the German dramas then in vogue, the extraordinary plots of which, as"
204,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"well as their language, alternately ultrasentimental and domestically"
205,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"bathotic, well marked them out for ridicule, is distinguished by sharp"
206,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,wit and broad humour of the happiest kind. CANNING and his coadjutors in
207,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"this piece did a real service to literature, and assisted in a"
208,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"purification which GIFFORD, by his demolition of the Della Cruscan"
209,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"school of poetry, had so well begun. Of _The Friend of Humanity and the"
210,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,Knife-grinder_ it is unnecessary to speak; perhaps no lines in the
211,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"English language have been more effective, or oftener quoted."
212,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,
213,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"But CANNING’S greatest power is shown in _New Morality_, which, being"
214,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"the last of the series, seems to have been reserved as a concentrating"
215,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,medium for his pent-up scorn and contempt of the Whigs and their
216,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,adherents. So that their blows fall thick (for he was powerfully
217,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"seconded by Frere, Gifford, and Ellis), they care little who suffer from"
218,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"them, and the modern reader is surprised to find CHARLES LAMB and other"
219,EDITOR’S PREFACE.,"non-intruders into politics, figuring as congenial conspirators with TOM"
220,PAINE!,PAINE!
221,PAINE!,
222,PAINE!,It is somewhat difficult to regard PITT in the character of a Wit and a
223,PAINE!,"Poet, as from the narrative of most of his biographers, he might be"
224,PAINE!,"considered as uniformly cold, stiff, and unbending; but his intimate"
225,PAINE!,"friend WILBERFORCE, in his _Memoirs_, thus describes him: “PITT, when"
226,PAINE!,"free from shyness, and amongst his intimate companions, was the very"
227,PAINE!,"soul of merriment and conversation. He was the wittiest man I ever knew,"
228,PAINE!,"and what was quite peculiar to himself, had at all times his wit under"
229,PAINE!,entire controul. Others appeared struck by the unwonted association of
230,PAINE!,brilliant images; but every possible combination of ideas seemed always
231,PAINE!,"present to his mind, and he could at once produce whatever he desired. I"
232,PAINE!,"was one of those who met to spend an evening in memory of Shakespeare,"
233,PAINE!,"at the Boar’s Head, Eastcheap. Many professed wits were present, but"
234,PAINE!,"PITT was the most amusing of the party, the readiest and most apt in the"
235,PAINE!,"required allusions.” It is not, therefore, at all unlikely, that he now"
236,PAINE!,"and then contributed witty verses to _The Anti-Jacobin_, in addition to"
237,PAINE!,"those which the Editor has, on probable grounds, ascribed to him in the"
238,PAINE!,present volume.
239,PAINE!,
240,PAINE!,"“Critical commentary,” says a critic of the previous edition, “on the"
241,PAINE!,"merits of _The Anti-Jacobin_, would be superfluous. Its satire is"
242,PAINE!,"distinguished for the terse language of its poignant personality, which"
243,PAINE!,"was often excessively stinging, but seldom offensively coarse. Its best"
244,PAINE!,"contributors, CANNING and FRERE, were not mere pamphleteers in verse,"
245,PAINE!,like the writers for _The Rolliad_. They had poetical inspiration and a
246,PAINE!,sprightly joyousness springing from a genial play of the mental
247,PAINE!,faculties. They were ‘Conservatives’ not only in their politics but in
248,PAINE!,their loyal adherence to the ordinances and traditions of classical
249,PAINE!,"English literature. False sentiment, tumid diction, mawkish cant, were"
250,PAINE!,chastised by them with exemplary efficacy. On the fourth edition of the
251,PAINE!,"complete work (1799, 2 Vols. 8vo, containing both prose and poetry),"
252,PAINE!,"they placed the epigraph, _Sparsosque recolligit ignes_; and in the very"
253,PAINE!,"last paper (No. 36), the motto on discontinuance was exquisitely happy:—"
254,PAINE!,
255,PAINE!,“‘We shall miss thee;
256,PAINE!,But yet thou shalt have freedom.
257,PAINE!,So to the elements
258,PAINE!,Be free; and fare thou well!’
259,PAINE!,
260,PAINE!,"“And these lines, taken from _The Tempest_ (probably by CANNING), have"
261,PAINE!,"been prophetic of the popularity of their witty verse, still quoted and"
262,PAINE!,admired by all lovers of the genius that is airily elegant and strong.”

358,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"original _Anti-Jacobin_, but by a preconcerted arrangement it was"
359,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"determined that the spirit which had pervaded that work, and which had"
360,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"had so powerful an effect on the popular mind, and thereby, in"
361,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"connection with Gillray’s caricatures, so undoubtedly strengthened the"
362,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"hands of the Ministry, should not die, if it could be kept alive by"
363,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,other and congenial writers. In the words of MR. FOX BOURNE (in his
364,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"valuable work on _English Newspapers_, 1887): “Though _The Anti-Jacobin_"
365,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"made its last appearance on July 9, 1798, there was started a few days"
366,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,before a monthly _Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine_ of the same
367,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"politics, but much less brilliant, and more ponderous. Strange to say,"
368,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"it also was edited by a GIFFORD, or one who so called himself. JOHN"
369,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"RICHARDS GREEN was a bold and versatile adventurer, who, having to fly"
370,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"from his creditors in 1782, returned from France in 1788, as JOHN"
371,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"GIFFORD, and was connected with several newspapers [including the"
372,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"establishment of _The British Critic_], besides editing _The"
373,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"Anti-Jacobin Review_. [He also wrote a _History of France_, and other"
374,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"works.] Befriended in many ways by PITT, he wrote a four-volume pamphlet"
375,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"[3 vols. 4to, and also 6 vols. 8vo, both dated 1809], styled the _Life"
376,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"of William Pitt_, after his patron’s death. JAMES MILL, the friend and"
377,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"associate of JEREMY BENTHAM, was glad to earn money in his struggling"
378,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,days by writing non-political articles for _The Anti-Jacobin Review_.
379,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"WILLIAM GIFFORD, it is hardly necessary to state, besides editing Ben"
380,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,"Jonson’s Works, and other useful occupations, was the first editor of"
381,AND ITS SUCCESSORS.,_The Quarterly Review_ in 1809.”

726,LINE.,and his shop was the general morning resort of the friends of the
727,LINE.,"ministry, as DEBRETT’S was of the oppositionists. About the time when"
728,LINE.,"the _Anti-Jacobin_ was contemplated, OWEN, who had been the publisher of"
729,LINE.,"BURKE’S pamphlets, failed. The editors of the _Anti-Jacobin_ took his"
730,LINE.,"house, paying the rent, taxes, &c., and gave it up to WRIGHT, reserving"
731,LINE.,"to themselves the first floor, to which a communication was opened"
732,LINE.,through WRIGHT’S house. Being thus enabled to pass to their own rooms
733,LINE.,"through WRIGHT’S shop, where their frequent visits did not excite any"
734,LINE.,"remarks, they contrived to escape particular observation.”"

739,LINE.,"open upon the table, and as others of the party dropped in, hints or"
740,LINE.,suggestions were made; sometimes whole passages were contributed by some
741,LINE.,"of the parties present, and afterwards altered by others, so that it is"
742,LINE.,"almost impossible to ascertain the names of the authors. Where, in the"
743,LINE.,"above notes, a piece is ascribed to different authors, the conflicting"
744,LINE.,"statements may arise from incorrect information, but sometimes they"
745,LINE.,"arise from the whole authorship being assigned to one person, when, in"
746,LINE.,"fact, both may have contributed. If we look at the references, 167, 185,"
747,LINE.,"we shall see CANNING naming several authors, whereas LORD BURGHERSH"
748,LINE.,assigns all to one author. CANNING’S authority is here more to be relied

1254,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",the crowd of competitors which have gotten the start of it in the race
1255,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",for public favour.
1256,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1257,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","[As this _Prospectus_ was written by MR. CANNING, and it has been"
1258,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",prefixed only to the former edition of the _Poetry_ by the present
1259,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Editor, it is again considered an interesting addition to the"
1260,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",present one.]
1261,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1262,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",The grounds upon which such pretensions have usually been rested by
1263,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","those who have engaged in undertakings of this kind, are accuracy,"
1264,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","variety, and priority of Intelligence, connections at home,"
1265,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","correspondence abroad, and, above all, a profession of impartial and"
1266,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","unprejudiced attention to all opinions, and to all parties and"
1267,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",descriptions of men.
1268,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1269,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",On none of these Topicks is it Our intention to enlarge.
1270,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1271,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Of Our means of information, and of the use which We make of them, our"
1272,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","readers will, after a very short trial, be enabled to form their own"
1273,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","opinion. And to that trial We confidently commit ourselves: professing,"
1274,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","however, at the same time, that if the only advantage which We were"
1275,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","desirous of holding out to our Readers, were that of having it in our"
1276,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","power to apprize them an hour or a day sooner than those Journals, which"
1277,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","are already in their hands, of any event however important—We should"
1278,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","bring to the undertaking much less anxiety for success, and should state"
1279,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","our claims on public attention with much less boldness, than We are"
1280,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","disposed to do in the consciousness of higher purposes, and more"
1281,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",beneficial views.
1282,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1283,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",Novelty indeed We have to announce. For what so new in the present state
1284,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","of the daily and weekly PRESS (We speak generally, though there are"
1285,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",undoubtedly exceptions which we may have occasion to point out
1286,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",hereafter) as THE TRUTH? To this object alone it is that Our labours are
1287,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","dedicated. It is the constant violation, the disguise, the perversion of"
1288,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","the Truth, whether in narrative or in argument, that will form the"
1289,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",principal subject of our WEEKLY EXAMINATION: and it is by a diligent and
1290,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","faithful discharge of this duty—by detecting falsehood, and rectifying"
1291,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","error, by correcting misrepresentation, and exposing and chastising"
1292,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","malignity—that We hope to deserve the reception which We solicit, and to"
1293,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","obtain not only the approbation of the Country to our attempt, but its"
1294,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",thanks for the motives which have given birth to it.
1295,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1296,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",These are strong words. But We are conscious of intending in earnest
1297,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",what they profess. How far the execution of our purpose may correspond
1298,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","with the design, it is for others to determine. It is ours to state that"
1299,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","design fairly, and in the spirit in which we conceive it."
1300,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1301,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Of the utility of such a purpose, if even tolerably executed, there can"
1302,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","be little doubt, among those persons (a very large part of the"
1303,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","community) who must have found themselves, during the course of the last"
1304,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","few years, perplexed by the multiplicity of contradictory accounts of"
1305,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",almost every material event that has occurred in that eventful and
1306,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",tremendous period; and who must anxiously have wished for some public
1307,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",channel of information on which they could confidently rely for forming
1308,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",their opinion.
1309,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1310,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",But before We can expect sufficient credit from persons of this
1311,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","description, to enable us to supply such a defect, and to assume an"
1312,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","office so important, it is natural that they should require some"
1313,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",profession of our principles as well as of our purposes; in order that
1314,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",they may judge not only of our ability to communicate the information
1315,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","which We promise, but of our intention to inform them aright."
1316,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1317,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","To that freedom from _partiality_ and _prejudice_, of which We have"
1318,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","spoken above, by the profession of which so many of our Contemporaries"
1319,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","recommend themselves, We make little pretension—at least in the sense in"
1320,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",which those terms appear now too often to be used.
1321,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1322,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",We have not arrived (to our shame perhaps we avow it) at that wild and
1323,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","unshackled freedom of thought, which rejects all habit, all wisdom of"
1324,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","former times, all restraints of ancient usage, and of local attachment;"
1325,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","and which judges upon each subject, whether of politicks or morals, as"
1326,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","it arises, by lights entirely its own, without reference to recognized"
1327,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","principle, or established practice."
1328,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1329,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","We confess, whatever disgrace may attend such a confession, that We have"
1330,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",not so far gotten the better of the influence of long habits and early
1331,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","education, not so far imbibed that spirit of liberal indifference, of"
1332,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","diffused and comprehensive philanthropy, which distinguishes the candid"
1333,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","character of the present age, but that We have our feelings, our"
1334,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","preferences, and our affections, attaching on particular places,"
1335,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","manners, and institutions, and even on particular portions of the human"
1336,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",race.
1337,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1338,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",It may be thought a narrow and illiberal distinction—but We avow
1339,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","ourselves to be _partial_ to the COUNTRY _in which we live_,"
1340,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",notwithstanding the daily panegyricks which we read and hear on the
1341,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",superior virtues and endowments of its rival and hostile neighbours. We
1342,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","are _prejudiced_ in favour of _her_ Establishments, civil and religious;"
1343,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","though without claiming for either that ideal perfection, which modern"
1344,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",philosophy professes to discover in the other more luminous systems
1345,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",which are arising on all sides of us.
1346,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1347,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","The safety and prosperity of _these kingdoms_, however unimportant they"
1348,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",may seem in abstract contemplation when compared with the more
1349,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","extensive, more beautiful, and more productive parts of the world, do"
1350,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",yet excite in our minds a peculiar interest and anxiety; and will
1351,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",probably continue to occupy a share of our attention by no means
1352,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",justified by the proportional consequence which speculative reasoners
1353,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",may think proper to assign to them in the scale of the universe.
1354,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1355,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",We should be averse to hazarding the smallest part of the practical
1356,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",happiness of _this Country_; though the sacrifice should be recommended
1357,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",as necessary for accomplishing throughout the world an uniform and
1358,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",beautiful system of theoretical liberty: and We should at all times
1359,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","exert our best endeavours for upholding its constitution, even with all"
1360,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","the human imperfections which may belong to it, though We were assured"
1361,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",that on its ruins might be erected the only pillar that is yet wanting
1362,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",to complete the “_most glorious fabrick which the Integrity and Wisdom
1363,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",of man have raised since the Creation_”.
1364,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1365,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","If, as Philosopher MONGE[6] avers, in his eloquent and instructive"
1366,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","address to the Directory, “_The Government of England and the French"
1367,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Republick cannot exist together_,” We do not hesitate in our choice;"
1368,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","though well aware that in that choice we may be much liable, in the"
1369,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","opinion of many critics of the present day, to the imputation of a want"
1370,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",of candour or of discernment.
1371,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1372,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Admirers of military heroism, and dazzled by military success in common"
1373,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","with other men, We are yet even _here_ conscious of some qualification"
1374,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",and distinction in our feelings: We acknowledge ourselves apt to look
1375,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","with more complacency on bravery and skill, when displayed in the"
1376,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","service of our Country, than when We see them directed against its"
1377,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","interests or its safety; and, however equal the claims to admiration in"
1378,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","either case may be, We feel our hearts grow warmer at the recital of"
1379,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","what has been atchieved by HOWE, by JERVIS, or by DUNCAN, than at the"
1380,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","“_glorious victory of Jemappe_,” or “_the immortal battle of the bridge"
1381,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",of Lodi_”.
1382,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1383,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",In MORALS We are equally old-fashioned. We have not yet learned the
1384,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","modern refinement of referring in all considerations upon human conduct,"
1385,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","not to any settled and preconceived principles of right and wrong, not"
1386,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","to any general and fundamental rules which experience, and wisdom, and"
1387,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","justice, and the common consent of mankind have established, but to the"
1388,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",internal admonitions of every man’s judgment or conscience in his own
1389,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",particular instance.
1390,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1391,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","We do not dissemble,—that We reverence LAW,—We acknowledge USAGE,—We"
1392,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",look even upon PRESCRIPTION without hatred or horror. And we do not
1393,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","think these, or any of them, less safe guides for the moral actions of"
1394,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","men, than that new and liberal system of ETHICS, whose operation is not"
1395,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",to bind but to loosen the bands of social order; whose doctrine is
1396,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","formed not on a system of reciprocal duties, but on the supposition of"
1397,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","individual, independent, and unconnected rights; which teaches that all"
1398,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","men are pretty equally honest, but that some have different notions of"
1399,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","honesty from others, and that the most received notions are for the"
1400,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",greater part the most faulty.
1401,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1402,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","We do not subscribe to the opinion, that a sincere conviction of the"
1403,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","truth of no matter what principle, is a sufficient defence for no matter"
1404,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",what action; and that the only business of moral enquiry with human
1405,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",conduct is to ascertain that in each case the principle and the action
1406,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","agree. We have not yet persuaded ourselves to think it a sound, or a"
1407,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","safe doctrine, that every man who can divest himself of a moral sense in"
1408,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","theory, has a right to be with impunity and without disguise a scoundrel"
1409,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","in practice. It is not in our creed, that ATHEISM is as good a faith as"
1410,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","CHRISTIANITY, provided it be professed with equal sincerity; nor could"
1411,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","We admit it as an excuse for MURDER, that the murderer was in his own"
1412,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",mind conscientiously persuaded that the murdered might for many good
1413,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",reasons be better out of the way.
1414,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1415,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Of all these and the like principles, in one word, of JACOBINISM in all"
1416,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","its shapes, and in all its degrees, political and moral, public and"
1417,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","private, whether as it openly threatens the subversion of States, or"
1418,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","gradually saps the foundations of domestic happiness, We are the avowed,"
1419,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","determined, and irreconcileable enemies. We have no desire to divest"
1420,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",ourselves of these inveterate prejudices; but shall remain stubborn and
1421,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",incorrigible in resisting every attempt which may be made either by
1422,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",argument or (what is more in the charitable spirit of modern reformers)
1423,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","by force, to convert us to a different opinion."
1424,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1425,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1426,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",It remains only to speak of the details of our PLAN.
1427,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1428,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","It is our intention to publish Weekly, during the Session of Parliament,"
1429,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","a Paper, containing,"
1430,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1431,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","First, An Abstract of the important events of the week, both at home and"
1432,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",abroad.
1433,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1434,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Secondly, Such Reflections as may naturally arise out of them: and,"
1435,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1436,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Thirdly, A contradiction and confutation of the falsehoods and"
1437,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","misrepresentations concerning these events, their causes, and their"
1438,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","consequences, which may be found in the Papers devoted to the cause of"
1439,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","SEDITION and IRRELIGION, to the pay or principles of FRANCE."
1440,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1441,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","This last, as it is by far the most important, will in all probability"
1442,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","be the most copious of the three heads; and is that to which, above all"
1443,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","others, We wish to direct the attention of our Readers."
1444,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1445,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","We propose diligently to collect, as far as the range of our own daily"
1446,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","reading will enable us, and We promise willingly to receive, from"
1447,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","whatever quarter they may come, the several articles of this kind which"
1448,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",require to be thus contradicted or confuted; which will naturally divide
1449,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","themselves into different classes, according to their different degrees"
1450,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",of stupidity or malignity.
1451,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1452,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","There are, for instance (to begin with those of the highest order), the"
1453,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","LIES of the Week; the downright, direct, unblushing falsehoods, which"
1454,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","have no colour or foundation whatever, and which must at the very moment"
1455,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","of their being written, have been known to the writer to be wholly"
1456,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",destitute of truth.
1457,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1458,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Next in rank come MISREPRESENTATIONS which, taking for their groundwork"
1459,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","facts in substance true, do so colour and distort them in description,"
1460,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",as to take away all semblance of their real nature and character.
1461,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1462,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Lastly, The most venial, though by no means the least mischievous class,"
1463,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","are MISTAKES; under which description are included all those Hints,"
1464,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Conjectures, and Apprehensions, those Anticipations of Sorrow and"
1465,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","Deprecations of Calamity, in which Writers who labour under too great an"
1466,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","anxiety for the Public Welfare are apt to indulge; and which, when"
1467,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","falsified by the event, they are generally too much occupied to find"
1468,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",leisure to retract or disavow:—A trouble which We shall have great
1469,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",pleasure in taking off these Gentlemen’s hands.
1470,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1471,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",To each of these several articles We shall carefully affix the name and
1472,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",date of the Publication from which We may take the liberty of borrowing

1476,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","With regard to the PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT, We shall not fail to mark"
1477,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",to Our Readers the progress of the public business; though it does not
1478,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",enter into our Plan to give a regular detail of the Debates: nor would
1479,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",the limits of our Paper allow of it.
1480,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1481,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","We have a further reason for not occupying this province, which will"
1482,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","equally account for our determination, not to receive Advertisements—our"

1484,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",Print.
1485,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",
1486,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","It is obvious upon every ground of fairness and of policy, that We must"
1487,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",entertain this desire very strongly with regard to the respectable
1488,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",Papers which are directed by principles and attachments like our own: an
1489,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",attachment (We have no wish to disguise it) to the cause of a
1490,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","GOVERNMENT, with whose support, whose popularity and consequent means of"
1491,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","exertion, the circumstances of the present times have essentially"

1493,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",

1496,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","pernicious doctrines We reckon for the main support, as they have been"
1497,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",the principal cause of our undertaking. These We would entreat to
1498,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",proceed with fresh vigour and increased activity. It is our wish to be
1499,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","seen together, and to be compared with them. Every week of"
1500,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,",misrepresentation will be followed by its weekly comment; and with this
1501,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","corrective faithfully administered, the longest course of MORNING"
1502,"WEEKLY EXAMINER,","CHRONICLES or MORNING POSTS, of STARS or COURIERS, may become not only"

1562,INTRODUCTION.,In our anxiety to provide for the amusement as well as information of
1563,INTRODUCTION.,"our readers, we have not omitted to make all the inquiries in our power"
1564,INTRODUCTION.,for ascertaining the means of procuring poetical assistance. And it
1565,INTRODUCTION.,would give us no small satisfaction to be able to report that we had
1566,INTRODUCTION.,succeeded in this point precisely in the manner which would best have
1567,INTRODUCTION.,"suited our own taste and feelings, as well as those which we wish to"
1568,INTRODUCTION.,cultivate in our readers.
1569,INTRODUCTION.,
1570,INTRODUCTION.,"But whether it be that good Morals, and what we should call good"
1571,INTRODUCTION.,"Politics, are inconsistent with the spirit of true Poetry—whether “_the"
1572,INTRODUCTION.,Muses still with freedom found_” have an aversion to _regular_
1573,INTRODUCTION.,"governments, and require a frame and system of protection less"
1574,INTRODUCTION.,"complicated than king, lords, and commons:—"

1578,INTRODUCTION.,

1580,INTRODUCTION.,"or moral, or philosophical (which last is understood to mean something"
1581,INTRODUCTION.,"more than the other two, though exactly _what_, it is difficult to say),"
1582,INTRODUCTION.,"we have not been able to find one good and true Poet, of sound"
1583,INTRODUCTION.,"principles and sober practice, upon whom we could rely for furnishing us"
1584,INTRODUCTION.,with a handsome quantity of sufficient and approved verse—such verse as
1585,INTRODUCTION.,"our readers might be expected to get by heart, and to sing; as the"
1586,INTRODUCTION.,worthy philosopher MONGE describes the little children of Sparta and
1587,INTRODUCTION.,"Athens singing the songs of Freedom, in expectation of the coming of"
1588,INTRODUCTION.,_the Great Nation_.
1589,INTRODUCTION.,
1590,INTRODUCTION.,In this difficulty we have had no choice but either to provide no poetry
1591,INTRODUCTION.,at all—a shabby expedient—or to go to the only market where it is to be
1592,INTRODUCTION.,"had good and ready made, that of the _Jacobins_—an expedient full of"
1593,INTRODUCTION.,"danger, and not to be used but with the utmost caution and delicacy."
1594,INTRODUCTION.,
1595,INTRODUCTION.,"To this latter expedient, however, after mature deliberation, we have"
1596,INTRODUCTION.,determined to have recourse; qualifying it at the same time with such
1597,INTRODUCTION.,precautions as may conduce at once to the safety of our readers’
1598,INTRODUCTION.,"principles, and to the improvement of our own poetry."
1599,INTRODUCTION.,
1600,INTRODUCTION.,"For this double purpose, we shall select from time to time from among"
1601,INTRODUCTION.,"those effusions of the _Jacobin_ Muse which happen to fall in our way,"
1602,INTRODUCTION.,such pieces as may serve to illustrate some one of the principles on
1603,INTRODUCTION.,which the poetical as well as the political doctrine of the NEW SCHOOL
1604,INTRODUCTION.,"is established—prefacing each of them, for our readers’ sake, with a"
1605,INTRODUCTION.,short disquisition on the particular tenet intended to be enforced or
1606,INTRODUCTION.,insinuated in the production before them—and accompanying it with an
1607,INTRODUCTION.,"humble effort of our own, in imitation of the poem itself, and in"
1608,INTRODUCTION.,further illustration of its principle.
1609,INTRODUCTION.,
1610,INTRODUCTION.,"By these means, though we cannot hope to catch “_the wood-notes wild_”"
1611,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Bards of Freedom, we may yet acquire, by dint of repeating after"
1612,INTRODUCTION.,"them, a more complete knowledge of the secret in which their greatness"
1613,INTRODUCTION.,lies than we could by mere prosaic admiration; and if we cannot become
1614,INTRODUCTION.,"poets ourselves, we at least shall have collected the elements of a"
1615,INTRODUCTION.,_Jacobin_ Art of Poetry for the use of those whose genius may be more
1616,INTRODUCTION.,capable of turning them to advantage.
1617,INTRODUCTION.,
1618,INTRODUCTION.,It might not be unamusing to trace the springs and principles of this
1619,INTRODUCTION.,"species of poetry, which are to be found, some in the exaggeration, and"
1620,INTRODUCTION.,others in the direct inversion of the sentiments and passions which have
1621,INTRODUCTION.,"in all ages animated the breast of the favourite of the Muses, and"
1622,INTRODUCTION.,distinguished him from the “vulgar throng”.
1623,INTRODUCTION.,
1624,INTRODUCTION.,The poet in all ages has despised riches and grandeur.
1625,INTRODUCTION.,
1626,INTRODUCTION.,The _Jacobin_ poet improves this sentiment into a hatred of the rich and
1627,INTRODUCTION.,the great.
1628,INTRODUCTION.,
1629,INTRODUCTION.,The poet of other times has been an enthusiast in the love of his native
1630,INTRODUCTION.,soil.
1631,INTRODUCTION.,
1632,INTRODUCTION.,The _Jacobin_ poet rejects all restriction in his feelings. _His_ love
1633,INTRODUCTION.,is enlarged and expanded so as to comprehend all human kind. The love of
1634,INTRODUCTION.,all human kind is without doubt a noble passion: it can hardly be
1635,INTRODUCTION.,"necessary to mention that its operation extends to _freemen_, and them"
1636,INTRODUCTION.,"only, all over the world."
1637,INTRODUCTION.,
1638,INTRODUCTION.,"The old poet was a warrior, at least in imagination; and sung the"
1639,INTRODUCTION.,actions of the heroes of his country in strains which “made Ambition
1640,INTRODUCTION.,"Virtue,” and which overwhelmed the horrors of war in its glory."
1641,INTRODUCTION.,
1642,INTRODUCTION.,The _Jacobin_ poet would have no objection to sing battles too—but _he_
1643,INTRODUCTION.,"would take a distinction. The prowess of Buonaparte, indeed, he might"
1644,INTRODUCTION.,chant in his loftiest strain of exultation. _There_ we should find
1645,INTRODUCTION.,"nothing but trophies and triumphs and branches of laurel and olive,"
1646,INTRODUCTION.,"phalanxes of Republicans shouting victory, satellites of despotism"
1647,INTRODUCTION.,"biting the ground, and geniuses of Liberty planting standards on"
1648,INTRODUCTION.,mountain-tops.
1649,INTRODUCTION.,
1650,INTRODUCTION.,"But let his own country triumph, or her allies obtain an advantage:"
1651,INTRODUCTION.,"straightway the “beauteous face of war” is changed; the “pride, pomp,"
1652,INTRODUCTION.,"and circumstance” of victory are kept carefully out of sight, and we are"
1653,INTRODUCTION.,"presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered"
1654,INTRODUCTION.,"peasants, and deserted looms. Our poet points the thunder of his blank"
1655,INTRODUCTION.,"verse at the head of the recruiting serjeant, or roars in dithyrambics"
1656,INTRODUCTION.,against the lieutenants of pressgangs.
1657,INTRODUCTION.,
1658,INTRODUCTION.,But it would be endless to chase the coy Muse of _Jacobinism_ through
1659,INTRODUCTION.,all her characters. _Mille habet ornatus._ The _Mille decenter habet_ is
1660,INTRODUCTION.,"perhaps more questionable. For in whatever disguise she appears, whether"
1661,INTRODUCTION.,"of mirth or of melancholy, of piety or of tenderness; under all"
1662,INTRODUCTION.,"disguises, like _Sir John Brute_ in woman’s clothes, she is betrayed by"
1663,INTRODUCTION.,her drunken swagger and ruffian tone.
1664,INTRODUCTION.,
1665,INTRODUCTION.,In the poem which we have selected for the edification of our readers
1666,INTRODUCTION.,"and our own imitation this day, the principles which are meant to be"
1667,INTRODUCTION.,"inculcated speak so plainly for themselves, that they need no previous"

1721,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","however, was disgraced by the most reckless debauchery, which might"
1722,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",seem more appropriate in such libertines as Rochester and Sedley

1725,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",appear that the general opinion at that time was that profligacy of

1778,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","their jurisdiction, and defied them in the following bold terms:"
1779,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","“‘But, Mr. Speaker, since you and this House have renounced your"
1780,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","allegiance to your Sovereign, and are become a den of thieves,"
1781,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",should I bow myself in this House of Rimmon the Lord would not
1782,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",pardon me’. The whole House were electrified.... He was voted guilty
1783,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",of high treason without any trial. The day of execution was then
1784,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","debated. HARRY MARTEN, who had not yet spoken, rose, not to dissent"
1785,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","from the vote of the House, he observed, but he had something to say"
1786,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","about the time of the execution. ‘Mr. Speaker,’ said he, ‘everyone"
1787,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",must believe that this old gentleman here is fully possessed in his
1788,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","head resolved to die a martyr in his cause, for otherwise he would"
1789,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",never have provoked the House by such biting expressions. If you
1790,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","execute him, you do precisely that which he hopes for, and his"
1791,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","execution will have a great influence over the people, since he is"

1793,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","the day of execution, and in meantime force him to live in spite of"
1794,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",his teeth.’ The drollery of the motion put the House into better
1795,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","humour, and he was reprieved. After being kept in various prisons"
1796,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","for eleven years, he was released by Cromwell, and died in 1663,"

1798,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",
1799,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",Another instance may be given of MARTEN’S felicitous humour and
1800,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","humane temper. When the Commons had rid themselves of the Sovereign,"
1801,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",_they voted the Lords to be dangerous and useless_. But MARTEN
1802,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","proposed an amendment in their favour; namely, that _they were"

1804,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,",
1805,"SHE WHIPP’D TWO FEMALE ’PRENTICES TO DEATH,","His speeches in the House were represented to have been not long,"

2205,IV.,and the publication by the National Assembly (on 20th August
2206,IV.,following) of the famous “Declaration of Rights”—a manifesto which
2207,IV.,"became the creed of the Revolution, and which promulgated, as the"
2208,IV.,"basis of social government, the specious but impracticable doctrines"
2209,IV.,"of _liberty_, _equality_, and _the sovereignty of the people_"
2210,IV.,exercised by universal suffrage. How the hopes and anticipations of
2211,IV.,"moderate reformers, as embodied in these lines, were falsified by"
2212,IV.,the spoliations and massacres which rapidly followed are but too
2213,IV.,well known.
2214,IV.,
2215,IV.,"When, therefore, the _Anti-Jacobin_ was established to combat the"

2217,IV.,"purposes, maliciously referred to, and significantly recommended to"
2218,IV.,be “recited on the anniversary of the 14th August”. To make this
2219,IV.,"allusion more clear, it must be remembered that on the 10th August,"
2220,IV.,"1792, after frightful massacres, the Hotel de Ville was seized and"
2221,IV.,the Tuileries stormed. On the 13th the king and family were
2222,IV.,"imprisoned in the Temple. His deposition, the dismissal of the"
2223,IV.,"Ministers, and the formation of a National Convention, on more"
2224,IV.,"popular principles than the Legislative Assembly, were decreed by"
2225,IV.,the victors. On the 14th Le Brun became Minister for Foreign
2226,IV.,"Affairs, Danton for Justice, and Monge for Marine; while the"
2227,IV.,"Girondist Ministers, Roland, Servan, and Clavière, resumed their"

2308,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2309,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,MR. GREY made a very fine speech. He described the ministers as
2310,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,“bold bad men”—their measures he repeatedly declared to be not only
2311,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"“weak, but wicked”."
2312,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2313,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,MR. BYNG said a few words.
2314,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2315,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"GENERAL TARLETON and the _Electors of Liverpool_ being given, the"
2316,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"General, after an eulogium on Mr. Fox, begged to anticipate their"
2317,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"favourite concluding toast, and to give “_The Cause of Freedom all"
2318,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,over the World_”. This toast unfortunately gave rise to an
2319,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,altercation which threatened to disturb the harmony of the evening.
2320,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Olaudah Equiano, the African, and Henry Yorke, the mulatto, insisted"
2321,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,upon being heard; but as it appeared that they were entering upon a
2322,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,subject which would have entirely altered the complexion of the
2323,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Meeting, they were, though not without some difficulty, withheld"
2324,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,from proceeding further.
2325,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2326,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"MR. ERSKINE rose, in consequence of some allusions which had been"
2327,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,made to Trial by Jury. He professed himself to be highly flattered
2328,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,by the encomiums which had been lavished upon him; at the same time
2329,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"he was conscious that he could not, without some degree of reserve,"
2330,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,consent to arrogate to himself those qualities which the partiality
2331,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"of his friends had attributed to him. He had, on former occasions,"
2332,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,declared himself to be clothed with the infirmities of man’s nature;
2333,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,and he now begged leave in all humility to reiterate that
2334,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"confession; he should never cease to consider himself as a feeble,"
2335,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"and with respect to the extent of his faculties in many respects, a"
2336,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"finite being—he had ever borne in mind, and he hoped he should ever"
2337,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"continue to bear in mind, those words of the inspired Penman, “Thou"
2338,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"hast made him less than the angels, to crown him with glory and"
2339,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,honour”. These lines were indeed applicable to the state of man in
2340,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"general, but of no man more than himself; they appeared to him"
2341,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"pointed and personal, and little less than prophetic; they were"
2342,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,always present to his mind; he could wish to wear them in his breast
2343,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"as a sort of amulet against the enchantment of public applause, and"
2344,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,the witcheries of vanity and self-delusion; yet if he were indeed
2345,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,possessed of those superhuman powers—all pretensions to which he
2346,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,again begged leave most earnestly to disclaim—if he were endowed
2347,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"with the eloquence of an angel, and with all those other faculties"
2348,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"which we attribute to angelic natures, it would be impossible for"
2349,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,him to do justice to the eloquence with which the Honourable
2350,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Gentleman who opened the meeting had defended the Cause of Freedom,"
2351,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,identified as he conceived it to be with the persons and government
2352,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,of the DIRECTORY. In his present terrestrial state he could only
2353,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,address it as a prayer to God and as counsel to Man that the words
2354,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,which they had heard from that Honourable Gentleman might work
2355,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"inwardly in their hearts, and in due time, produce the fruit of"
2356,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,Liberty and Revolution.
2357,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2358,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,He had not the advantage of being personally acquainted with any of
2359,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"the Gentlemen of the DIRECTORY; he understood, however, that one of"
2360,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"them (MR. MERLIN) previous to the last change, had stood in a"
2361,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"situation similar to his own—he was, in fact, nothing less than a"
2362,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"leading Advocate and Barrister in the midst of a free, powerful and"
2363,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,enlightened people.
2364,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2365,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,The conduct of the DIRECTORY with regard to the exiled Deputies had
2366,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,been objected to by some persons on the score of a pretended rigour.
2367,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"For his part he should only say that having been, as he had been,"
2368,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"both a Soldier and a Sailor, if it had been his fortune to have"
2369,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,stood in either of those two relations to the DIRECTORY—as a Man and
2370,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,as a Major-General he should not have scrupled to direct his
2371,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,artillery against the National Representation:—as a Naval Officer he
2372,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,would undoubtedly have undertaken for the removal of the Exiled
2373,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Deputies; admitting the exigency, under all its relations, as it"
2374,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"appeared to him to exist, and the then circumstances of the times,"
2375,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"with all their bearings and dependencies, branching out into an"
2376,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"infinity of collateral considerations, and involving in each a"
2377,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"variety of objects political, physical, and moral; and these again"
2378,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"under their distinct and separate heads, ramifying into endless"
2379,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,subdivisions which it was foreign to his purpose to consider.
2380,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2381,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Having thus disposed of this part of his subject, MR. ERSKINE passed"
2382,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,in a strain of rapid and brilliant allusions over a variety of
2383,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,points characteristic of the conduct and disposition of the present
2384,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Ministry; Mr. Burke’s metaphor of “the Swinish Multitude,” Mr."
2385,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Reeves’ metaphor of the “Tree of Monarchy,” “the Battle of Tranent,”"
2386,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"“the March to Paris,” the phrase of “Acquitted Felons,” and the"
2387,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,exclamation of “Perish Commerce”—which last expression he declared
2388,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"he should never cease to attribute to Mr. Windham; so long, at"
2389,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"least, as it should please the Sovereign Dispenser to continue to"
2390,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,him the power of utterance and the enjoyment of his present
2391,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"faculties. He condemned the expedition to Quiberon, he regretted the"
2392,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"“Fate of Messrs. Muir and Palmer,” he exulted in the “Acquittal of"
2393,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Citizens Tooke, Hardy, Thelwall, Holcroft and others,” and he"
2394,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,blessed that Providence to which (as it had been originally allotted
2395,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,to him (Mr. Erskine) the talents which had been exerted in their
2396,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,defence) the preservation of those Citizens might perhaps be
2397,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,indirectly attributed. He then descanted on the captivity of La
2398,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Fayette, and the Dividend on the Imperial Loan."
2399,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2400,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"After fully exhausting these subjects, MR. ERSKINE resumed a topic"
2401,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,on which he had only slightly glanced before. In a most delicate and
2402,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"sportive vein of humour he contended, that if the people were a"
2403,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Swinish Multitude, those who represented them must necessarily be a"
2404,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,Swinish Representation. It would be in vain to attempt to do justice
2405,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,to the polite and easy pleasantry which pervaded this part of MR.
2406,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,ERSKINE’S speech. Suffice it to say that the taste of the Audience
2407,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"showed itself in complete unison with the genius of the Orator, and"
2408,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,the whole of this passage was crowned with loud and reiterated
2409,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"plaudits. After a speech of unexampled exertion, MR. ERSKINE now"
2410,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,began to enter much at length into a recital of select passages from
2411,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"our most approved English authors, concluding with a copious extract"
2412,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,from the several Publications of the late MR. BURKE; but such were
2413,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,the variety and richness of his quotations which he continued to an
2414,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"extent far exceeding the limits of this paper, that we found"
2415,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"ourselves under the necessity, either of considerably abridging our"
2416,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"original matter, or omitting them altogether, which latter"
2417,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,alternative we adopted the more readily as the greater part of these
2418,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,brilliant citations have already passed through the ordeal of a
2419,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,public and patriotic auditory; and as there is every probability
2420,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,that the circumstances of the times will again call them forth on
2421,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,some future emergency.
2422,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2423,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"MR. ERSKINE concluded by recapitulating, in a strain of agonizing"
2424,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"and impressive eloquence, the several more prominent heads of his"
2425,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"speech:—He had been a Soldier and a Sailor, and had a son at"
2426,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Winchester school—He had been called by Special Retainers, during"
2427,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"the summer, into many different and distant parts of the"
2428,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,country—travelling chiefly in Post-chaises—He felt himself called
2429,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,upon to declare that his poor faculties were at the service of his
2430,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,Country—of the free and enlightened part of it at least—He stood
2431,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"here as a Man—He stood in the Eye, indeed in the Hand of GOD—to whom"
2432,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,(in the presence of the Company and Waiters) he solemnly appealed—He
2433,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"was of Noble, perhaps, Royal Blood—He had a house at Hampstead—was"
2434,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,convinced of the necessity of a thorough and radical Reform—His
2435,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,Pamphlet had gone through Thirty Editions—skipping alternately the
2436,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"odd and even numbers—He loved the Constitution, to which he would"
2437,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,cling and grapple—And he was clothed with the infirmities of man’s
2438,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,nature—He would apply to the present French Rulers (particularly
2439,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,BARRAS and REUBEL) the words of the poet:—
2440,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2441,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,“Be to their Faults a little blind;
2442,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"“Be to their Virtues very kind,"
2443,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"“Let all their ways be unconfin’d,"
2444,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,“And clap the Padlock on their mind!”
2445,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2446,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"And for these reasons, thanking the Gentlemen who had done him the"
2447,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"honour to drink his Health, he should propose “MERLIN, _the late"
2448,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"Minister of Justice, and Trial by Jury!_” MR. ERSKINE here concluded"
2449,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,a speech which had occupied the attention and excited the applause
2450,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"of his Audience during a space of little less than three hours,"
2451,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"allowing for about three quarters of an hour, which were occupied by"
2452,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"successive fits of fainting, between the principal subdivisions of"
2453,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"his discourse.—MR. ERSKINE descended from the Table, and was"
2454,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,conveyed down stairs by the assistance of his friends. On arriving
2455,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"at the corner of the Piazzas, they were surprized by a very"
2456,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,unexpected embarrassment. MR. ERSKINE’S horses had been taken from
2457,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"the carriage, and a number of able Chairmen engaged to supply their"
2458,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,place; but these fellows having contrived to intoxicate themselves
2459,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"with the money which the Coachman had advanced to them on account,"
2460,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"were become so restive and unruly, so exorbitant in their demands"
2461,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,(positively refusing to abide by their former engagement) that MR.
2462,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"ERSKINE deemed it unsafe to trust himself in their hands, and"
2463,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,determined to wait the return of his own more tractable and less
2464,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,chargeable animals. This unpleasant scene continued for above an
2465,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,hour.
2466,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,
2467,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,MR. SHERIDAN’S health was now drunk in his absence and received with
2468,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,an appearance of general approbation;—when in the midst of the
2469,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"applause MR. FOX arose, in apparent agitation, and directed the"
2470,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.,"attention of the Company to the rising, manly virtues of MR."
2471,MACFUNGUS.,MACFUNGUS.
2472,MACFUNGUS.,
2473,MACFUNGUS.,MR. MACFUNGUS declared that to pretend he was not elated by the
2474,MACFUNGUS.,encomiums with which MR. FOX had honoured him was an affectation
2475,MACFUNGUS.,which he disdained;—such encomiums would ever form the proudest
2476,MACFUNGUS.,recompense of his patriotic labours—he confessed they were cheering
2477,MACFUNGUS.,to him—he felt them warm at his heart—and while a single fibre of
2478,MACFUNGUS.,"his frame preserved its vibration, it would throb in unison to the"
2479,MACFUNGUS.,approbation of that Honourable Gentleman. The applause of the
2480,MACFUNGUS.,Company was no less flattering to him—he felt his faculties
2481,MACFUNGUS.,"invigorated by it, and stimulated to the exertion of new energies in"
2482,MACFUNGUS.,the race of mind. Every other sensation was obliterated and absorbed
2483,MACFUNGUS.,"by it; for the present, however, he would endeavour to suppress his"
2484,MACFUNGUS.,"feelings, and concentre his energies for the purpose of explaining"
2485,MACFUNGUS.,to the Company why he assisted now for the first time at the
2486,MACFUNGUS.,celebration of the Fifth Revolution which had been effected in
2487,MACFUNGUS.,regenerated France. The various and extraordinary talents of the
2488,MACFUNGUS.,"Right Hon. Gentleman—his vehement and overpowering perception, his"
2489,MACFUNGUS.,vigorous and splendid intuition would for ever attract the
2490,MACFUNGUS.,admiration of all those who were in any degree endowed with those
2491,MACFUNGUS.,faculties themselves or capable of estimating them in others; as
2492,MACFUNGUS.,"such, he had ever been among the most ardent admirers, and on many"
2493,MACFUNGUS.,"occasions, among the most ardent supporters of the Right Hon."
2494,MACFUNGUS.,Gentleman—he agreed with him in many points—in his general love of
2495,MACFUNGUS.,Liberty and Revolution; in his execration of the War; in his
2496,MACFUNGUS.,"detestation of Ministers; but he entertained his doubts, and till"
2497,MACFUNGUS.,"those doubts were cleared up, he could not, consistently with his"
2498,MACFUNGUS.,"principles, attend at the celebration of any Revolution whatever."
2499,MACFUNGUS.,
2500,MACFUNGUS.,"These doubts, however, were now satisfactorily done away. A pledge"
2501,MACFUNGUS.,had been entered into for accomplishing an effectual radical
2502,MACFUNGUS.,"Revolution; not for the mere overthrow of the present System, nor"
2503,MACFUNGUS.,for the establishment of any other in its place; but for the
2504,MACFUNGUS.,effecting such a series of Revolutions as might be sufficient for
2505,MACFUNGUS.,the establishment of a Free System.
2506,MACFUNGUS.,
2507,MACFUNGUS.,MR. MACFUNGUS continued he was incapable of compromising with first
2508,MACFUNGUS.,"principles, of acquiescing in short-sighted temporary palliative"
2509,MACFUNGUS.,expedients: if such had been his temper he should assuredly have
2510,MACFUNGUS.,rested satisfied with the pledge which that Right Hon. Gentleman had
2511,MACFUNGUS.,entered into about six months ago on the subject of Parliamentary
2512,MACFUNGUS.,"Reform, in which pledge he considered the promise of that previous"
2513,MACFUNGUS.,"and preliminary Revolution, to which he had before alluded, as"
2514,MACFUNGUS.,essentially implicated.
2515,MACFUNGUS.,
2516,MACFUNGUS.,"“Whenever this Reform takes place,” exclaimed MR. MACFUNGUS, “the"
2517,MACFUNGUS.,present degraded and degrading system must fall into dissolution; it
2518,MACFUNGUS.,must sink and perish with the corruptions which have supported it.
2519,MACFUNGUS.,"The national energies will awake, and shaking off their lethargy as"
2520,MACFUNGUS.,"their fetters drop from them, they will follow the Angel of their"
2521,MACFUNGUS.,"Revolution, while the Genius of Freedom soaring aloft beneath the"
2522,MACFUNGUS.,orb of Gallic Illumination will brush away as with the wing of an
2523,MACFUNGUS.,Eagle all the cobwebs of Aristocracy. But before the Temple of
2524,MACFUNGUS.,"Freedom can be erected in their place, the surface which they have"
2525,MACFUNGUS.,occupied must be smoothed and levelled—it must be cleared by
2526,MACFUNGUS.,repeated Revolutionary Explosions from all the lumber and rubbish
2527,MACFUNGUS.,"with which Aristocracy and Fanaticism will endeavour to encumber it,"
2528,MACFUNGUS.,"and to impede the progress of the holy work.—The sacred level, the"
2529,MACFUNGUS.,"symbol of Fraternal Equality, must be passed over the whole.—The"
2530,MACFUNGUS.,"completion of the Edifice will indeed be the more tardy, but it will"
2531,MACFUNGUS.,not be the less durable for having been longer delayed—Cemented with
2532,MACFUNGUS.,"the blood of tyrants, and the tears of the Aristocracy, it will rise"
2533,MACFUNGUS.,a monument for the astonishment and veneration of future ages. The
2534,MACFUNGUS.,"remotest posterity, with our children yet unborn, and the most"
2535,MACFUNGUS.,"distant portions of the Globe, will crowd around its Gates and"
2536,MACFUNGUS.,demand admission into its Sanctuary.—The Tree of Liberty will be
2537,MACFUNGUS.,"planted in the midst of it, and its branches will extend to the ends"
2538,MACFUNGUS.,"of the Earth, while the Friends of Freedom meet and fraternize and"
2539,MACFUNGUS.,amalgamate under its consolatory shade. There our Infants shall be
2540,MACFUNGUS.,taught to lisp in tender accents the Revolutionary Hymn—there with
2541,MACFUNGUS.,"wreaths of myrtle, and oak, and poplar, and vine and olive and"
2542,MACFUNGUS.,cypress and ivy; with violets and roses and daffodils and dandelions
2543,MACFUNGUS.,in our hands we will swear respect to childhood and manhood and old
2544,MACFUNGUS.,"age, and virginity and womanhood and widowhood; but above all to the"
2545,MACFUNGUS.,Supreme Being.—There we will decree and sanction the Immortality of
2546,MACFUNGUS.,"the Soul.—There pillars and obelisks, and arches and pyramids, will"
2547,MACFUNGUS.,awaken the love of Glory and of our Country.—There Painters and
2548,MACFUNGUS.,"Statuaries, with their chisels and colours, and Engravers with their"
2549,MACFUNGUS.,engraving tools will perpetuate the interesting features of our
2550,MACFUNGUS.,"Revolutionary Heroes; while our Poets and Musicians, with an"
2551,MACFUNGUS.,"honourable emulation, strive to immortalize their memory. Their"
2552,MACFUNGUS.,"bones will be entombed in the Vault below, while their sacred Shades"
2553,MACFUNGUS.,continue hovering over our Heads—those venerated Manes which from
2554,MACFUNGUS.,time to time will require to be appeased by the blood of the
2555,MACFUNGUS.,"remaining Aristocrats.—Then Peace and Freedom, and Fraternity and"
2556,MACFUNGUS.,Equality will pervade the whole Earth—while the Vows of
2557,MACFUNGUS.,"Republicanism, the Alter of Patriotism, and the Revolutionary"
2558,MACFUNGUS.,"Pontiff, with the thrilling volcanic Sympathies, whether of Holy"
2559,MACFUNGUS.,"Fury or of ardent Fraternal Civism, uniting and identifying, produce"
2560,MACFUNGUS.,as it were an electric Energy.”
2561,MACFUNGUS.,
2562,MACFUNGUS.,"MR. MACFUNGUS here paused for a few moments, seemingly overpowered"
2563,MACFUNGUS.,"by the excess of Sensibility, and the force of the ideas which he"
2564,MACFUNGUS.,was labouring to convey.—The whole Company appeared to sympathize
2565,MACFUNGUS.,"with his unaffected emotions. After a short interval, he recovered"
2566,MACFUNGUS.,"himself from a very impressive silence, and continued as follows:"
2567,MACFUNGUS.,
2568,MACFUNGUS.,"“These prospects, Fellow-Citizens, may possibly be deferred. The"
2569,MACFUNGUS.,"Machiavelism of Governments may for the time prevail, and this"
2570,MACFUNGUS.,unnatural and execrable contest may yet be prolonged; but the hour
2571,MACFUNGUS.,"is not far distant; Persecution will only serve to accelerate it,"
2572,MACFUNGUS.,and the blood of Patriotism streaming from the severing axe will
2573,MACFUNGUS.,call down vengeance on our oppressors in a voice of Thunder. I
2574,MACFUNGUS.,"expect the contest, and I am prepared for it.—I hope I shall never"
2575,MACFUNGUS.,shrink nor swerve nor start aside wherever duty and inclination may
2576,MACFUNGUS.,"place me. My services, my life itself, are at your disposal—Whether"
2577,MACFUNGUS.,"to act or to suffer, I am yours—With HAMPDEN in the field, or with"
2578,MACFUNGUS.,SIDNEY on the scaffold. My example may be more useful to you than my
2579,MACFUNGUS.,talents: and this head may perhaps serve your cause more
2580,MACFUNGUS.,"effectually, if placed on a pole on Temple Bar, than if it was"
2581,MACFUNGUS.,"occupied in organizing your Committees, in preparing your"
2582,MACFUNGUS.,"Revolutionary Explosions, and conducting your Correspondence.”"
2583,MACFUNGUS.,
2584,MACFUNGUS.,"MR. MACFUNGUS said he should give, as an unequivocal test of his"
2585,MACFUNGUS.,"sentiments, “BUONAPARTE AND A RADICAL REFORM”."
2586,MACFUNGUS.,
2587,MACFUNGUS.,The conclusion of MR. MACFUNGUS’S speech was followed by a
2588,MACFUNGUS.,simultaneous burst of rapturous approbation from every part of the
2589,MACFUNGUS.,"room. The applause continued for several minutes, during which MR."
2590,MACFUNGUS.,MACFUNGUS repeatedly rose to express his feelings.
2591,MACFUNGUS.,
2592,MACFUNGUS.,The conversation now became more mixed and animated; several
2593,MACFUNGUS.,"excellent Songs were sung, and Toasts drank, while the progressive"
2594,MACFUNGUS.,and patriotic festivity of the evening was heightened by the vocal
2595,MACFUNGUS.,powers of several of the most popular Singers. A new Song written by
2596,MACFUNGUS.,Captain MORRIS received its sanction in the warmest expression of
2597,MACFUNGUS.,applause. The whole company joined with enthusiasm in their old
2598,MACFUNGUS.,favourite Chorus of Bow! Wow!! Wow!!!]

3965,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"entitled _The Life of the Right Hon. William Pitt_, published by him"

3968,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,sent me upon it with the intent of counteracting some negociations

3989,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"Ladies were gone upstairs we conversed, for some time on Foreign"
3990,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,affairs.... Speaking of the Russian business of last year he
3991,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,reprobated in the strongest terms the conduct of FOX in sending an
3992,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"agent, MR. ADAIR, to Petersburg to counteract the negociations of"
3993,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,this Court at that of Russia. He told me he knew for certain that
3994,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,MR. ADAIR had shewn to some English merchants at Petersburg the
3995,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,Empress’ Picture set in diamonds which had been given to him. That
3996,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"it was not one of the sort usually given, but of much greater value,"
3997,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"being set round with large Brilliants, and the whole Picture covered"
3998,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,with a Table Diamond instead of Chrystal. That this was a present
3999,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,seldom made but on some very particular occasion or to some great
4000,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,favorite (I remember to have seen such a one in the possession of P.
4001,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,Orlow). LD. ST. H. thought it must have been worth six or seven
4002,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"thousand pounds, and of too much value probably to have been meant"
4003,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,for MR. ADAIR. The conclusion we both very naturally drew from this

4006,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,The following additional particulars relating to the connection
4007,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,between FOX and ADAIR may not be thought out of place here. They are

4012,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,
4013,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"The first is in these terms: “When ADAIR, whose father was a"
4014,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"surgeon, went as FOX’S Ambassador to Russia, LORD WHITWORTH, then"
4015,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"the King’s Minister, made a good joke, which tended not a little to"
4016,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"lower ADAIR, and defeat his object. ‘Est-ce un homme très"
4017,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"considérable, ce M. d’Adair?’ asked the EMPRESS. ‘Pas trop, Madame,’"
4018,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"replied Lord Whitworth, ‘quoique son père était grand seigneur"
4019,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,[saigneur].’” The other is taken from a very long statement on
4020,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"various matters, made by K. George IV., when Prince of Wales, to"
4021,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"Croker personally. Adair’s wife, the Prince said, was a Frenchwoman"

4122,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"The public, distracted with the various accounts of the celebration"
4123,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"of Mr. Fox’s Birth-day, naturally turn to us for an authentic detail"
4124,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,of that important event—from a recollection of the correct and
4125,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"impartial statement we gave in a former Number, of what passed at a"
4126,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM [page 32].
4127,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4128,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"To justify their confidence, we have had recourse to the _Morning"
4129,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,Post_ and _Morning Chronicle_ (the _Courier_ being too stupid for
4130,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"our purpose), whose statements we have carefully read, and corrected"
4131,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,from the information of several gentlemen who were present. We are
4132,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,thus enabled to lay before our readers a genuine narrative of the
4133,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"whole proceeding, which we defy the tongue of Slander to controvert"
4134,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,in any material point.
4135,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4136,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"As Mr. Fox’s reputation had been for some time on the decline, it"
4137,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,was thought necessary by the party (who are in great want of a
4138,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,_Head_) to make as respectable an appearance as possible on the
4139,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,present occasion. It was therefore suggested (at a previous meeting
4140,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,of confidential friends) that if the unfortunate shyness which
4141,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,subsisted between the _Whig Club_ and the _Corresponding Society_
4142,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,could be opportunely removed by a few unimportant concessions on the
4143,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"part of the former, such a number of citizens might be readily"
4144,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,procured from that respectable body as would serve to give the day
4145,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,an _éclat_ it had not experienced since the fatal schism of 1792.
4146,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4147,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"This hint, so reasonable in itself, was immediately adopted, and Sir"
4148,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"FRANCIS BURDETT, who was well acquainted with their haunts, was"
4149,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,ordered into the neighbourhood of Smithfield with a competent number
4150,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"of tickets. He was on the point of setting out, when the Editor of"
4151,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"the _Morning Post_ observed, that _forgery_[106] was so common at"
4152,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"present, that he hardly thought it prudent to admit all who might"
4153,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,come with a bit of scribbled paper: on this it was determined to
4154,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,distribute the price of admission amongst a certain number of people
4155,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"to be selected by the Envoy:—these, it was rightly concluded, would"
4156,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"not fail to appear, from motives of vanity, as they could have no"
4157,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"other possible chance of dining with the Premier Dupe, we would say"
4158,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"Duke, in England. It now remained to determine the sum: this, after"
4159,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"a short discussion, was fixed at Eight Shillings and Sixpence per"
4160,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"head, “which,” said the Editor of the _Morning Post_, “will shew we"
4161,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"cannot he persons of mean rank, since we can afford, in hard times,"
4162,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,to give so much for a dinner”;[107] and Citizen BOSVILLE was desired
4163,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,to advance the money upon the credit of the Whig Fund.
4164,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4165,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"Previous to the meeting, the chairman dispatched a note to Sir"
4166,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"WILLIAM ADDINGTON, requesting that the Crown and Anchor might be"
4167,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,exempted from the visitation of his runners during the morning of
4168,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"the 24th [Jan., 1798]. To this Sir WILLIAM assented, on condition"
4169,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"that it should be recommended to the gentlemen, to leave their"
4170,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"pocket-books and watches at home, that there might be as little"
4171,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,temptation as possible to break the peace. Thus everything was
4172,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,arranged with a precaution that seemed to set accident at defiance.
4173,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4174,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"Before four o’clock the passage to the LARGE ROOM was crammed, when,"
4175,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"on a hint that dinner was on the point of being served, one of the"
4176,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"head waiters advanced to the great door, and opened a wicket for the"
4177,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"admission of the company, as fast as they paid down their money. Two"
4178,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"or three had already passed in good order, when Mr. John Nicholls"
4179,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"advanced, and instead of 8s. 6d., produced to the astonished"
4180,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"receiver, _seventeen_ of his PRINTED SPEECHES, which, valuing them"
4181,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"at sixpence a-piece, he contended would make up the sum required."
4182,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"These “_assets_” however, were absolutely rejected; and a violent"
4183,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"dispute was on the point of commencing, when Sir CHRISTOPHER HAWKINS"
4184,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"stept forward, and whispering a few words, which we did not hear,"
4185,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,obtained leave for his friend to pass. The Speeches were therefore
4186,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"deposited, and Mr. NICHOLLS was already got within the wicket, when"
4187,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"the man suddenly pulled him back by the coat, and the dispute"
4188,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,recommenced with more violence than ever. Upon inquiry into the
4189,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"cause of this new tumult, we found that a wag (whom we afterwards"
4190,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,discovered to be Mr. JEKYLL) had played the member for Tregony a
4191,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"trick; having taken an opportunity, in the crowd, of extracting the"
4192,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"_genuine_ speeches from the pocket of the Honourable Member, and"
4193,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"replacing them by the same number of the _spurious_ ones, printed"
4194,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"for Mr. WRIGHT, the publisher of this Paper. These the waiter very"
4195,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"properly refused to receive, alleging, and indeed truly, that"
4196,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"instead of _six_ pence a-piece, the whole seventeen were not worth"
4197,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,_six_ farthings.
4198,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4199,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"This altercation continued so long, that the company grew impatient;"
4200,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"and Mr. BRYAN EDWARDS, a little ashamed of his friend, who still"
4201,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"continued obstinate, offered to furnish his quota. Harmony now"
4202,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"seemed to be restored, when all at once a cry of astonishment broke"
4203,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,forth that beggars all description. On putting his hand into his
4204,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"pocket for the price of admission, Mr. E. suddenly turned pale, and"
4205,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"exclaimed, “by G—, gentlemen, some of you have picked my pockets!” A"
4206,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"hundred voices instantly repeated the same cry, and a dreadful scene"
4207,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,of confusion and uproar took place.
4208,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4209,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,Ardebant cuncta et fracta compage ruebant.
4210,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4211,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"What the consequence would have been, it is impossible to say, had"
4212,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"not the waiter, with an air of authority, commanded the doors to be"
4213,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"shut at each end of the passage, and every man to exhibit the"
4214,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,contents of his pocket. A faint cry of No! No! was over-ruled; and
4215,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,Sir FRANCIS BURDETT produced an old Red Cap from the bosom of his
4216,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"shirt, which he put into the hands of the Duke of BEDFORD, who was"
4217,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,appointed collector-general _by acclamation_. With this his Grace
4218,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"went, from man to man, executing his duty with the utmost fairness"
4219,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"and impartiality; and when he had finished, poured out the contents"
4220,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"of the cap before them all. These, it must be confessed, were a"
4221,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"little heterogeneous, consisting, besides a large sum of money, of a"
4222,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"brass knocker (this was immediately claimed by the landlord), a"
4223,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"pewter pot squeezed together, a pair of pattens, a pint decanter, a"
4224,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"duck ready trussed for dressing, a great quantity of potatoes, and a"
4225,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"vinegar cruet. What was most extraordinary was, that though, as his"
4226,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"Grace afterwards declared, the money was found in very unequal"
4227,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"portions, yet the total sum, which was £222, 5s. 6d., being divided"
4228,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"among the company, amounting to 523 persons, produced 8s. 6d. for"
4229,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"each individual, with the exception of the _Member_ for _Tregony_,"
4230,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"who brought nothing but his speech, and Capt. MORRIS, who pays for"
4231,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,everything with a Song.
4232,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4233,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"Nothing material occurred during the Dinner, which was allowed to be"
4234,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"excellent of its kind, and where no such dish as Cow-heel (as"
4235,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,maliciously reported in _The True Briton_) made its appearance.
4236,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4237,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"As soon as the cloth was removed, the Duke of NORFOLK took the Chair"
4238,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"amidst repeated plaudits,[108] and addressed the Company in these"
4239,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,words:
4240,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4241,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"“Three virtuous Men, Citizens, have stood up in defence of"
4242,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"Liberty—MAXIMILIAN ROBESPIERRE, COLLOT D’HERBOIS, and CHARLES JAMES"
4243,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,FOX:—The first is guillotined; the second transported to _Cayenne_;
4244,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"and the third”——Here all eyes were immediately upon Mr. FOX, who now"
4245,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"entered the room, supported by Citizens JOHN GALE JONES and JOHN"
4246,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"HORNE TOOKE—“As the Right Hon. Gentleman (resumed the Duke, a little"
4247,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"peevishly) has mistaken his cue, and appeared sooner than he ought,"
4248,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"I shall spare his modesty the panegyric I was preparing, and shortly"
4249,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,conclude with proposing the health of CHARLES JAMES FOX.”—This was
4250,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,drank with three times three.
4251,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,
4252,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"As soon as the clamour had subsided, Mr. FOX arose and said, “That"
4253,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"language, at least any which he could boast, was inadequate to the"
4254,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,exquisite feelings of gratitude which at once delighted and
4255,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"oppressed him, at the sight of so numerous and so respectable a body"
4256,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"of free and independent Citizens, met for a purpose which would make"
4257,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,this the proudest and the happiest day of his life”. Having dwelt a
4258,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"little on this idea, Mr. FOX observed, “that he would not interrupt"
4259,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,the conviviality of the day by a long Speech: he knew there were
4260,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"several present who came to hear him make a long Speech, but he"
4261,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,would not make a long Speech—to what purpose should he do it?—what
4262,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"could he add to the Speech lately delivered by him, and so"
4263,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"faithfully recorded in the ANTI-JACOBIN, a contemptible Publication,"
4264,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,but one to which the praise of Accuracy could not be denied. The new
4265,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,and extraordinary circumstances of the times called for new and
4266,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"extraordinary measures: he would, therefore, if they pleased,"
4267,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,compress what he had to say into a _Song_—(_loud applauses_)—One
4268,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,word only.—He owed both the _burden_ and the _idea_ of this Song to
4269,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"the _Morning Chronicle_. He had yesterday, the 23rd, found there A"
4270,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"BEGGING ADDRESS to the Nation, with DATE OBOLUM BELISARIO prefixed"
4271,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"to it as a Motto. This had pleased him much, and this morning at"
4272,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,"breakfast he had endeavoured to adapt it, _mutatis mutandis_, to his"
4273,MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.,own circumstances: he should now have the honour of giving it.”

4304,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4305,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Ye who heard me repeat that Resistance, at length,"
4306,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Was reduc’d, by PITT’S Bill, to a question of _Strength_,"

4308,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4309,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"We know not how far Mr. FOX might have proceeded, had he not been"
4310,SONG BY MR. FOX.,interrupted by a jangling of bells from the Side-table which
4311,SONG BY MR. FOX.,immediately drew all eyes that way. This proceeded from Capt.
4312,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"MORRIS, who had fallen asleep during Mr. FOX’S Song, and was now"
4313,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"nodding on his chair, with a large paper Cap on his head, ornamented"
4314,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"with gilt tassels and bells, which one of the company had"
4315,SONG BY MR. FOX.,dexterously whipped on unperceived. The first motion was that of
4316,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"indignation; but the stupid stare of the unconscious Captain, who"
4317,SONG BY MR. FOX.,half opened his eyes at every sound of the bells as his head rose or
4318,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"fell, and immediately closed them again, _somno vinoque gravatus_,"
4319,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"had such a powerful effect on the risible faculties of the Company,"
4320,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"that they broke, as if by consent, into the most violent and"
4321,SONG BY MR. FOX.,convulsive fits of laughter; Mr. FOX himself not being exempt from
4322,SONG BY MR. FOX.,the general contagion.
4323,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4324,SONG BY MR. FOX.,As soon as the Captain was made sensible of the cause of this
4325,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"uproar, he attempted to pull off the Cap, but was prevented by a"
4326,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Citizen from the _Corresponding Society_, who maintained that the"
4327,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Company had a right to be amused by the Captain in what manner they
4328,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"pleased; and that, as he seemed to amuse them more effectually in"
4329,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"_that state_ than in any other, he insisted, for one, on his"
4330,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"continuing to wear the Cap. This was universally agreed to, with the"
4331,SONG BY MR. FOX.,exception of the Duke of NORFOLK. The Captain was therefore led to
4332,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"the upper table, with all his “jangling honours loud upon him!”"
4333,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Here, as soon as he was seated, his Noble Friend called upon him for"
4334,SONG BY MR. FOX.,a Song.
4335,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4336,SONG BY MR. FOX.,The Captain sang the “PLENIPO” in his best manner.
4337,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4338,SONG BY MR. FOX.,This was received with great applause; and then the Duke gave “The
4339,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Defenders—of Ireland”—(_three times three_).
4340,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4341,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Captain MORRIS then began
4342,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4343,SONG BY MR. FOX.,“And all the Books of Moses”;—
4344,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4345,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"but was interrupted, before he had finished the first line, by Mr."
4346,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"TIERNEY, who declared he would not sit there and hear anything like"
4347,SONG BY MR. FOX.,ridicule on the Bible.[110]—(_Much coughing and scraping_.)—Mr.
4348,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Erskine took God to witness, that he thought the Captain meant no"
4349,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"harm;—and a gentleman from Cambridge, whose name we could not learn,"
4350,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"said, with great _naïveté_, that it was no more than was done every"
4351,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"day by his acquaintance. Mr. TIERNEY, however, persisted in his"
4352,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"opposition to the Song, and Captain MORRIS was obliged to substitute"
4353,SONG BY MR. FOX.,“Jenny Sutton” in the place of it.
4354,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4355,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"But the good humour of the company was already broken in upon, and"
4356,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Mr. TIERNEY soon after left the room (to which he did not return)
4357,SONG BY MR. FOX.,with greater marks of displeasure in his face than we ever remember
4358,SONG BY MR. FOX.,to have seen there.
4359,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4360,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"The Duke now gave RADICAL REFORM (_three times three, followed by"

4363,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"A Counsellor JACKSON attempted to sing “Paddy Whack,” but was soon"
4364,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"silenced, on account of his stupid perversion of the words, and his"
4365,SONG BY MR. FOX.,bad voice.
4366,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4367,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Citizen GALE JONES then rose and said—that he was no Orator, though"
4368,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"he got his living by oratory, being Chairman of a Debating Society."
4369,SONG BY MR. FOX.,He had also written a book—which he was told had some merit. He did
4370,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"not rise to recommend it, but he thought it right to _hint_, that"
4371,SONG BY MR. FOX.,those who wished for Constitutional information might be supplied
4372,SONG BY MR. FOX.,with it at the Bar; the price was trifling—Eighteen-pence was
4373,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"nothing to the majority of the Company;—to himself, indeed—(here Mr."
4374,SONG BY MR. FOX.,HORNE TOOKE called out Order! Order! with some marks of
4375,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"impatience)—He begged pardon, he would say no more—there was no one"
4376,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"whom he valued like Mr. TOOKE, there was no one indeed to whom he"
4377,SONG BY MR. FOX.,was under such obligations; the very shoes he had on were charged by
4378,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Citizen HARDY to Mr. TOOKE’S account—Mr. TOOKE was also a great
4379,SONG BY MR. FOX.,friend to a Radical Reform—he loved a Radical Reform himself; the
4380,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Poor must always love Radical Reforms—he should therefore beg leave
4381,SONG BY MR. FOX.,to propose the health of Mr. JOHN HORNE TOOKE.—(_Three times
4382,SONG BY MR. FOX.,three._)
4383,SONG BY MR. FOX.,
4384,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Mr. TOOKE rose, and spoke nearly as follows: “You all know,"
4385,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Citizens, in what detestation I once held the Man whose Birth-day we"
4386,SONG BY MR. FOX.,are now met to commemorate. You cannot yet have forgot the ‘TWO PAIR
4387,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"OF PORTRAITS’ I formerly published, nor the glaring light in which I"
4388,SONG BY MR. FOX.,hung up him and his father to the execration of an indignant
4389,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"posterity. You must also be apprized of the charges of Corruption,"
4390,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Insurrection, and Murder (_much hissing and applause, the latter"
4391,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"predominant_) which I brought against him, justly, as I must still"
4392,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"think, at a former Election for Westminster. How happens it then,"
4393,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"you will say, that I now come forward to do him honour? I will tell"
4394,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"you. At the last Election for Westminster, I had still my suspicions"
4395,SONG BY MR. FOX.,of his sincerity; he appeared too anxious to preserve measures with
4396,SONG BY MR. FOX.,the spruce and powdered Aristocrats who usually attended him to the
4397,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Hustings; nor was it till the fourth or fifth day before the close
4398,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"of the Poll, that those suspicions were removed. Aware that he was"
4399,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"losing ground among the People, he determined to make one great"
4400,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"effort to re-establish his popularity. He therefore came forward,"
4401,SONG BY MR. FOX.,and addressed the free and independent Electors in front of the
4402,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Hustings, in a Speech, of which the remembrance yet warms my heart."
4403,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"From that moment, I marked him as my own! Retractation was"
4404,SONG BY MR. FOX.,impossible; and the panegyric he lately delivered on a Radical
4405,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"Reform, in a House which I despise too much to name, was the natural"
4406,SONG BY MR. FOX.,and inevitable consequence of that day’s declaration. You may
4407,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"remember, that when I addressed my Friends, I only said, ‘Gentlemen,"
4408,SONG BY MR. FOX.,Mr. FOX has spoken my sentiments; he has even gone beyond them—but I
4409,SONG BY MR. FOX.,"thank him’.—What I then said I now repeat, with regard to his Speech"
4410,SONG BY MR. FOX.,on a late occasion—‘I AM MOST PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HIS CONDUCT;

4743,THE EDITOR.,THE EDITOR.
4744,THE EDITOR.,
4745,THE EDITOR.,[The following is the commencement of Knight’s poem:—
4746,THE EDITOR.,
4747,THE EDITOR.,Whether primordial motion sprang to life
4748,THE EDITOR.,From the wild war of elemental strife;
4749,THE EDITOR.,"In central chains the mass inert confined,"
4750,THE EDITOR.,And sublimated matter into mind:
4751,THE EDITOR.,"Or, whether one great all-pervading soul"
4752,THE EDITOR.,Moves in each part and animates the whole;
4753,THE EDITOR.,"Unnumbered worlds to one great centre draws,"
4754,THE EDITOR.,And governs all by pre-established laws:
4755,THE EDITOR.,"Whether in fates’ eternal fetters bound,"
4756,THE EDITOR.,Mechanic nature goes her endless round:
4757,THE EDITOR.,"Or ever varying, acts but to fulfil"
4758,THE EDITOR.,The sovereign mandates of Almighty will;—
4759,THE EDITOR.,"Let learned folly seek, or foolish pride,"
4760,THE EDITOR.,"Rash in presumptuous ignorance, decide.—ED.]"
4761,THE EDITOR.,
4762,THE EDITOR.,[Eminent as Richard Payne Knight was as a classical scholar and
4763,THE EDITOR.,"archæologist, his poetical powers were not highly appreciated by his"
4764,THE EDITOR.,"literary contemporaries, as is amusingly shown in a letter from"
4765,THE EDITOR.,"Horace Walpole, dated 22nd March, 1796, to the Rev. W. Mason, in"
4766,THE EDITOR.,which he declares how much he is “offended and disgusted by Mr.
4767,THE EDITOR.,"Knight’s new, insolent, and self-conceited poem”. He winds up thus:"
4768,THE EDITOR.,"“I send you a parody on two lines of Mr. Knight, which will show you"
4769,THE EDITOR.,that his poem is seen in its true light by a young man of allowed
4770,THE EDITOR.,"parts, MR. CANNING, whom I never saw. The originals are the two"
4771,THE EDITOR.,first lines at the top of page 5:”—
4772,THE EDITOR.,
4773,THE EDITOR.,"“Some fainter irritations seem to feel,"
4774,THE EDITOR.,Which o’er its languid fibres gently steal”.—KNIGHT.
4775,THE EDITOR.,
4776,THE EDITOR.,"“Cools the crimp’d cod, to pond-perch pangs imparts,"
4777,THE EDITOR.,"Thrills the shelled shrimps, and opens oysters’ hearts.”—CANNING."
4778,THE EDITOR.,
4779,THE EDITOR.,It is evident from this that Canning had thought of parodying the
4780,THE EDITOR.,"poem immediately after its publication, and that Walpole had seen a"
4781,THE EDITOR.,"specimen in manuscript, nearly two years before its publication in"
4782,THE EDITOR.,"the _Anti-Jacobin_, in which the two lines (28, 29) are thus"
4783,THE EDITOR.,altered:—
4784,THE EDITOR.,
4785,THE EDITOR.,"“Cools the crimpt cod, fierce pangs to perch imparts,"
4786,THE EDITOR.,"Shrinks shrivell’d shrimps, but opens oysters’ hearts”."
4787,THE EDITOR.,
4788,THE EDITOR.,"By an oversight, Peter Cunningham, in his edition of Walpole’s"
4789,THE EDITOR.,"Letters, attributes the latter’s attack to a previous production of"
4790,THE EDITOR.,"Knight’s, published in 1794, entitled _The Landscape: a didactic"
4791,THE EDITOR.,"Poem in three Books_, a work which had excited Walpole’s high"
4792,THE EDITOR.,indignation by expressing opinions opposed to his own.—ED.]

4801,THE EDITOR.,
4802,THE EDITOR.,"The specimen of the poem on the “Progress of Man,” with which we"
4803,THE EDITOR.,"favoured our Readers in our last Number, has occasioned a variety of"
4804,THE EDITOR.,"letters, which we confess have not a little surprised us, from the"
4805,THE EDITOR.,"unfounded, and even contradictory charges they contain. In one, we are"
4806,THE EDITOR.,"accused of Malevolence, in bringing back to notice a work that had been"
4807,THE EDITOR.,"quietly consigned to oblivion;—in another, of Plagiarism, in copying its"
4808,THE EDITOR.,"most beautiful passages;—in a third, of Vanity, in striving to imitate"
4809,THE EDITOR.,"what was in itself inimitable, &c., &c. But why this alarm? has the"
4810,THE EDITOR.,author of the “_Progress of Civil Society_” an exclusive patent for
4811,THE EDITOR.,fabricating _Didactic_ poems? or can we not write against Order and
4812,THE EDITOR.,Government without incurring the guilt of Imitation? We trust we were
4813,THE EDITOR.,not so ignorant of the nature of a didactic poem (so called from
4814,THE EDITOR.,"_didaskein_, to teach, and _poema_, a poem; because it teaches nothing,"
4815,THE EDITOR.,and is not poetical) even before the _“Progress of Civil Society”_
4816,THE EDITOR.,"appeared, but that we were capable of such an undertaking."
4817,THE EDITOR.,
4818,THE EDITOR.,"We shall only say further, that we do not intend to proceed regularly"
4819,THE EDITOR.,"with our Poem; but having the remaining thirty-nine Cantos by us, shall"
4820,THE EDITOR.,"content ourselves with giving, from time to time, such extracts as may"
4821,THE EDITOR.,happen to suit our purpose.
4822,THE EDITOR.,
4823,THE EDITOR.,"The following passage, which, as the reader will see by turning to the"
4824,THE EDITOR.,"Contents prefixed to the head of the Poem, is part of the First Canto,"
4825,THE EDITOR.,"contains so happy a deduction of MAN’S present state of Depravity, from"
4826,THE EDITOR.,"the first slips and failings of his Original State, and inculcates so"
4827,THE EDITOR.,"forcibly the mischievous consequences of _social_ or _civilized_, as"
4828,THE EDITOR.,"opposed to _natural_ society, that no dread of imputed imitation can"
4829,THE EDITOR.,prevent us from giving it to our readers.

5290,“THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"On the 6th of February, the next monthly meeting of the _Whig Club_"
5291,“THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"was held at the London Tavern, Ludgate Hill. The DUKE OF NORFOLK"
5292,“THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"presided. He gave as a toast, “The Man who dares be honest in the"
5293,“THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,worst of times—
5294,“THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,
5295,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.
5296,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,
5297,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"FOX returned thanks, and then toasted"
5298,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,
5299,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.
5300,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,
5301,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,He subsequently proposed the health of the Duke of Norfolk in a most
5302,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,powerful speech. He adverted to the dismissal of the DUKE. “No
5303,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"reason had been officially assigned; it was, however, generally"
5304,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,understood that it had arisen from the eulogium pronounced on
5305,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"GENERAL WASHINGTON. Was it to be wondered at, that the noble Duke,"
5306,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"who had uniformly opposed the American war, should have done so?"
5307,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"What Englishman, what man of any country, whose heart was animated"
5308,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"with a love of freedom, did not venerate the name of that"
5309,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,illustrious patriot? It seems also “a toast” has given offence—the
5310,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"Majesty of the People. I do not know upon what times we are fallen,"
5311,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,but the sovereignty of the people of Great Britain is surely a thing
5312,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"not new to the language, to the feelings, nor the hearts of"
5313,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,Englishmen. It is the basis of the whole system of our Government.
5314,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"It is an opinion, which if it be not true, King William was an"
5315,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,usurper. By what right did the glorious and immortal King William
5316,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"the Third, whose portrait is placed on our chair, come to the throne"
5317,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"of these realms, if not by that of the sovereignty of the people?..."
5318,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,The King holds his title by an Act of Parliament. Who called that
5319,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,Parliament? King William the Third. By what right did he obtain it?
5320,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,By a Convention representing the sovereignty of the people. The
5321,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,Convention of Representatives in fact did the thing. It is whimsical
5322,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,enough to deprive the noble Duke of his appointments for an offence
5323,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"which, if he had not committed during the reigns of George I. and"
5324,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"George II., would have subjected him to the charge of being a"
5325,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"Jacobite, and an adherent of the exiled family.... Of the persons of"
5326,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,his Majesty’s Ministers I will not say a word. There are several of
5327,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,them to whom I may fairly say this sentiment is not new. One member
5328,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,of the Cabinet (the Duke of Portland) is still a member of this
5329,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,club; another (Mr. Windham) was a member; and a third (Earl Spencer)
5330,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,long gloried in holding the same tenets. How often with the two
5331,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,first have we drunk the sentiment in this room! What did they mean
5332,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"when they drank the Sovereignty of the People? What, but that they"
5333,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,recognised by this approved and customary method a truth which
5334,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"belongs to all people in reality, but is the avowed basis of the"
5335,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"Government of England, that the people of every country are its"
5336,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"legitimate Sovereign, and that all authority is delegated from and"
5337,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"for them? I should be ashamed, on account of my old respect for"
5338,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"those persons, if they did not honestly avow this to be their sense"
5339,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,of the sentiment.”
5340,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,
5341,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"While adverting, on this occasion, to the dismissal of the DUKE OF"
5342,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"NORFOLK from his Lord-Lieutenancy and Colonelcy of Militia, FOX"
5343,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"remarked, “I have nothing the Ministers can take from me. I am still"
5344,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"indeed a Privy Councillor, at least I know nothing to the contrary;"
5345,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"and if this sentiment entitles the Noble Duke to this animadversion,"
5346,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,I shall certainly feel that I am equally entitled to this mark of
5347,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,his Majesty’s displeasure.” This anticipation was verified shortly
5348,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,afterwards.
5349,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,
5350,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"On the 1st of May following, at the Freemasons’ Tavern, another"
5351,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"dinner of the _Whig Club_ took place. FOX was in the chair, and"
5352,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,"gave, as the first toast—"
5353,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.,
5354,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.
5355,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.,
5356,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.,The Duke of Norfolk proposed “The Health of the Man who dares be
5357,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.,Honest in the worst of Times—
5358,“THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.,
5359,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.
5360,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,
5361,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,FOX responded in a most impressive speech. He said: “On any other
5362,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"occasion, he should have contented himself with returning thanks,"
5363,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,but in the very peculiar embarrassments in which the country was now
5364,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"plunged, he thought it necessary to say a few words in the only"
5365,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,place in which he thought it might be useful for him to deliver his
5366,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,sentiments. The circumstances and events of public affairs of late
5367,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,had induced him and many of his friends to abstain from their usual
5368,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,assiduous attendance in Parliament. Their exertions for the
5369,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,preservation of the Constitution had been of no avail; two years ago
5370,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,they had seen the repeal of the Bill of Rights carried by a
5371,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,triumphant majority; they had seen the functions of the
5372,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"Constitutional Law suspended, on alarm created by the Ministers"
5373,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"themselves; and however well-founded the alarm might now be, he"
5374,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,scorned the idea that it was necessary for him to attend in his
5375,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"place in the House of Commons, for the purpose only of vindicating"
5376,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,himself from the vulgar calumny that he was not an enemy to a
5377,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,foreign invasion. It would be an insult on his whole life if such a
5378,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,declaration could be expected from him. He believed there was not a
5379,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,voice in the assembly he addressed which was not in unison with his
5380,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"own—namely, that every man who heard him was both ready and willing"
5381,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"to stand forth in defence of his country, with the spirit that"
5382,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,belongs to Englishmen. He found no fault with those who thought it
5383,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,necessary to make these professions elsewhere. Thus much only would
5384,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,he say in this place for himself. _The present Government of the
5385,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"country, he had no hesitation in saying, was a Government of"
5386,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"Tyranny. They had adopted the principles of Robespierre, and their"
5387,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,object was to establish tyranny in England._ Look at the situation
5388,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,of the Sister Kingdom; our own will soon be the same. He had no
5389,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,remedy to recommend but that the friends of freedom should be united
5390,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"and firm, and wait for better times. Tyranny was now the order of"
5391,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,the day in every country in Europe. Notwithstanding the arbitrary
5392,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"proceedings of our own Ministers, he was persuaded the unanimous"
5393,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"feeling of the country, the universal determination of every man in"
5394,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"it was to be ready to take the field against a foreign foe; and,"
5395,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"indeed, they had a powerful motive to do so, for if they were"
5396,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"united, they had a better chance to get rid of the tyranny of their"
5397,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,own Ministers than they could possibly have by the success of a
5398,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,foreign invasion. Even in his present retirement he should be ready
5399,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"to come forward, in every constitutional effort, to regain our lost"
5400,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,liberties; and he should be in the foremost of the ranks to repel
5401,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,the invasion of a daring enemy.”
5402,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,
5403,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,This speech led to a most important consequence—the erasing from the
5404,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,Privy Council Book the name of one of the most illustrious statesmen
5405,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,which had ever adorned it. FOX’S name was struck out by the King on
5406,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,the 9th of May.
5407,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,
5408,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"On the 6th of June, after the dinner at the _Whig Club_, the DUKE OF"
5409,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"BEDFORD proposed “THE HEALTH OF CHARLES FOX,” and remarked in severe"
5410,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,terms on Ministers having caused the King to strike his name out of
5411,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,the list of the Privy Council. FOX said: “It would be most unfit for
5412,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,him to say a word respecting the Noble Duke’s allusion to a
5413,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,circumstance personal to himself. Would to God the time of the
5414,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,Ministers had been always employed in such _frivolous fooleries_ as
5415,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"settling who should be _Honourable_ and who _Right Honourable_, and"
5416,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,deliberating on the titles most befitting their friends and
5417,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"supporters.” FOX, with some of his supporters, seceded from"
5418,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"Parliament in 1797, and returned to the House of Commons in 1802 to"
5419,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"defend the Peace of Amiens, and he was persuaded to continue his"
5420,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,"parliamentary attendance by the urgent request of friends, with"
5421,“CHARLES JAMES FOX”.,whose wishes he felt himself bound to comply.—ED.]

6078,B. O. B.,
6079,B. O. B.,We cannot better explain to our readers the design of the poem from
6080,B. O. B.,"which the following extracts are taken, than by borrowing the"
6081,B. O. B.,"expressions of the author, Mr. HIGGINS, of _St. Mary Axe_, in the letter"
6082,B. O. B.,which accompanied the manuscript.
6083,B. O. B.,
6084,B. O. B.,"We must premise, that we had found ourselves called upon to remonstrate"
6085,B. O. B.,with Mr. H. on the freedom of some of the positions laid down in his
6086,B. O. B.,"other didactic poem, the “Progress of Man”; and had in the course of our"
6087,B. O. B.,remonstrance hinted something to the disadvantage of the _new
6088,B. O. B.,"principles_ which are now afloat in the world, and which are, in our"
6089,B. O. B.,"opinion, working so much prejudice to the happiness of mankind. To this"
6090,B. O. B.,Mr. H. takes occasion to reply—[195]
6091,B. O. B.,
6092,B. O. B.,"“What you call the _new principles_ are, in fact, nothing less than"
6093,B. O. B.,"_new_. They are the principles of primeval nature, the system of"
6094,B. O. B.,original and unadulterated man.
6095,B. O. B.,
6096,B. O. B.,“If you mean by my addiction to _new principles_ that the object which I
6097,B. O. B.,have in view in my larger work [meaning the ‘Progress of Man’] and in
6098,B. O. B.,the several other _concomitant_ and _subsidiary_ didactic poems which
6099,B. O. B.,"are necessary to complete my plan, is to restore this first, and pure"
6100,B. O. B.,simplicity; to rescue and to recover the interesting nakedness of human
6101,B. O. B.,"nature, by ridding her of the cumbrous establishments which the folly,"
6102,B. O. B.,"and pride, and self-interest of the worst part of our species have"
6103,B. O. B.,heaped upon her;—you are right. Such is my object. I do not disavow it.
6104,B. O. B.,Nor is it mine alone. There are abundance of abler hands at work upon
6105,B. O. B.,"it. _Encyclopedias_, _Treatises_, _Novels_, _Magazines_, _Reviews_, and"
6106,B. O. B.,"_New Annual Registers_, have, as you are well aware, done their part"
6107,B. O. B.,with activity and with effect. It remained to bring the _heavy_
6108,B. O. B.,artillery of a didactic poem to bear upon the same object.
6109,B. O. B.,
6110,B. O. B.,“If I have selected your paper as the channel for conveying my labours
6111,B. O. B.,"to the public, it was not because I was unaware of the hostility of your"
6112,B. O. B.,"principles to mine, of the bigotry of your attachment to ‘things as they"
6113,B. O. B.,"are,’ but because, I will fairly own, I found some sort of cover and"
6114,B. O. B.,disguise necessary for securing the favourable reception of my
6115,B. O. B.,"sentiments; the usual pretexts of humanity, and philanthropy, and fine"
6116,B. O. B.,"feeling, by which we have for some time obtained a passport to the"
6117,B. O. B.,"hearts and understandings of men, being now worn out or exploded. I"
6118,B. O. B.,"could not choose but smile at my success in the first instance, in"
6119,B. O. B.,inducing _you_ to adopt my poem as your own.
6120,B. O. B.,
6121,B. O. B.,"“But you have called for an explanation of these principles of ours, and"
6122,B. O. B.,"you have a right to obtain it. Our first principle is, then—the reverse"
6123,B. O. B.,"of the trite and dull maxim of Pope—‘_Whatever is, is right_’. We"
6124,B. O. B.,"contend, that ‘_Whatever is, is wrong_’; that institutions, civil and"
6125,B. O. B.,"religious, that social order (as it is called in _your_ cant) and"
6126,B. O. B.,"regular government, and law, and I know not what other fantastic"
6127,B. O. B.,"inventions, are but so many cramps and fetters on the free agency of"
6128,B. O. B.,man’s _natural intellect_ and _moral sensibility_; so many badges of his
6129,B. O. B.,degradation from the primal purity and excellence of his nature.
6130,B. O. B.,
6131,B. O. B.,"“Our second principle is, the ‘_eternal and absolute perfectibility of"
6132,B. O. B.,"man_’. We contend, that if, as is demonstrable, we have risen from a"
6133,B. O. B.,level with the _cabbages of the field_ to our present comparatively
6134,B. O. B.,"intelligent and dignified state of existence, by the mere exertion of"
6135,B. O. B.,"our own _energies_; we should, if these _energies_ were not repressed"
6136,B. O. B.,"and subdued by the operation of prejudice, and folly, by KING-CRAFT and"
6137,B. O. B.,"PRIEST-CRAFT, and the other evils incident to what is called civilized"
6138,B. O. B.,"society, continue to exert and expand ourselves in a proportion"
6139,B. O. B.,infinitely greater than anything of which we yet have any notion:—in a
6140,B. O. B.,_ratio_ hardly capable of being calculated by any science of which we
6141,B. O. B.,are now masters: but which would in time raise man from his present
6142,B. O. B.,biped state to a rank more worthy of his endowments and aspirations; to
6143,B. O. B.,"a rank in which he would be, as it were, _all_ MIND; would enjoy"
6144,B. O. B.,"unclouded perspicacity and perpetual vitality; feed on _oxygene_, and"
6145,B. O. B.,"never die, but _by his own consent_."
6146,B. O. B.,
6147,B. O. B.,“But though the poem of the PROGRESS OF MAN alone would be sufficient to
6148,B. O. B.,"teach this system and enforce these doctrines, the whole practical"
6149,B. O. B.,"effect of them cannot be expected to be produced, but by the gradual"
6150,B. O. B.,perfecting of each of the sublimer sciences;—at the husk and shell of
6151,B. O. B.,"which we are now nibbling and at the kernel whereof, in our present"
6152,B. O. B.,"state, we cannot hope to arrive. These several sciences will be the"
6153,B. O. B.,subjects of the several _auxiliary_ DIDACTIC POEMS which I have now in
6154,B. O. B.,"hand (one of which, entitled THE LOVES OF THE TRIANGLES, I herewith"
6155,B. O. B.,"transmit to you), and for the better arrangement and execution of which,"
6156,B. O. B.,I beseech you to direct your bookseller to furnish me with a handsome
6157,B. O. B.,Chambers’s Dictionary; in order that I may be enabled to go through the
6158,B. O. B.,"several articles alphabetically, beginning with _Abracadabra_, under the"
6159,B. O. B.,"first letter, and going down to _Zodiac_, which is to be found under the"
6160,B. O. B.,last.
6161,B. O. B.,
6162,B. O. B.,"“I am persuaded that there is no science, however abstruse, nay, no"
6163,B. O. B.,"trade or manufacture, which may not be taught by a didactic poem. In"
6164,B. O. B.,"that before you, an attempt is made (not unsuccessfully, I hope) to"
6165,B. O. B.,_enlist the imagination under the banners of Geometry_. _Botany_ I found
6166,B. O. B.,done to my hands. And though the more rigid and unbending stiffness of a
6167,B. O. B.,mathematical subject does not admit of the same appeals to the warmer
6168,B. O. B.,"passions, which naturally arise out of the _sexual_ (or, as I have heard"
6169,B. O. B.,"several worthy gentlewomen of my acquaintance, who delight much in the"
6170,B. O. B.,"poem to which I allude, term it, by a slight misnomer no way difficult"
6171,B. O. B.,to be accounted for—the _sensual_) system of Linnæus;—yet I trust that
6172,B. O. B.,the range and variety of illustration with which I have endeavoured to
6173,B. O. B.,"ornament and enlighten the arid truths of Euclid and Algebra, will be"
6174,B. O. B.,"found to have smoothed the road of Demonstration, to have softened the"
6175,B. O. B.,"rugged features of Elementary Propositions, and, as it were, to have"
6176,B. O. B.,strewed the _Asses’ Bridge_ with flowers.”
6177,B. O. B.,
6178,B. O. B.,"Such is the account which Mr. HIGGINS gives of his own undertaking, and"
6179,B. O. B.,"of the motives which have led him to it. For our parts, though we have"
6180,B. O. B.,not the same sanguine persuasion of the _absolute perfectibility_ of our
6181,B. O. B.,"species, and are in truth liable to the imputation of being more"
6182,B. O. B.,"satisfied with _things as they are_, than Mr. HIGGINS and his"
6183,B. O. B.,"associates;—yet, as we are, in at least the same proportion, less"
6184,B. O. B.,"convinced of the practical influence of didactic poems, we apprehend"
6185,B. O. B.,little danger to our readers’ morals from laying before them Mr.
6186,B. O. B.,"HIGGINS’S doctrine in its most fascinating shape. The poem abounds,"
6187,B. O. B.,"indeed, with beauties of the most striking kind,—various and vivid"
6188,B. O. B.,"imagery, bold and unsparing impersonifications; and similitudes and"
6189,B. O. B.,illustrations brought from the most ordinary and the most extraordinary
6190,B. O. B.,occurrences of nature—from history and fable—appealing equally to the
6191,B. O. B.,"heart and to the understanding, and calculated to make the subject of"
6192,B. O. B.,which the poem professes to treat rather amusing than intelligible. We
6193,B. O. B.,shall be agreeably surprised to hear that it has assisted any young
6194,B. O. B.,student at either University in his mathematical studies.
6195,B. O. B.,
6196,B. O. B.,"We need hardly add, that the plates illustrative of this poem (the"
6197,B. O. B.,engravings of which would have been too expensive for our publication)
6198,B. O. B.,"are to be found in Euclid’s Elements, and other books of a similar"
6199,B. O. B.,tendency.

6913,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"arrival in New South Wales, effected his escape, in an American"
6914,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"vessel, to South America, whence he proceeded to Spain. During this"
6915,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"voyage, in an action with a British frigate, he received a wound in"
6916,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"the head, from which he recovered; but on his arrival at his"
6917,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"destination, he was imprisoned by the Spanish authorities, until, on"
6918,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,the application of M. de Talleyrand in the name of the then
6919,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"government of France, he obtained his release. He then went to"

6925,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"similar charges of seditious practices, and were all sentenced to"
6926,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,fourteen years’ transportation. The former two died soon after
6927,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"reaching New South Wales. MAURICE MARGAROT, who appears to have"
6928,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,conducted himself throughout with the most abandoned and shameless
6929,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"profligacy, was the only one of these convicts—his fourteen years"

6940,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"deliberate verdict, that, with the exception of Muir, not one of"

6942,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"to a fair and impartial trial; and their trials were, one and all,"
6943,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,iniquitous. Of the six judges who presided in the first fourteen
6944,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"(1793–94), five were dull, timid nonentities; the sixth, Lord"
6945,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"Justice Clerk Braxfield, was, says Lord Cockburn, “a profound"
6946,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"practical lawyer, and a powerful man; coarse and illiterate ..."
6947,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"utterly devoid of judicial decorum, and though pure in the"

6950,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,case except that the upholding of his party was a duty attaching to
6951,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"his position. Over the five weak men who sat beside him, this coarse"
6952,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"and dexterous ruffian predominated as he chose.” But Jedburgh—no,"
6953,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,nor the Bloody Assize itself—could scarcely match one scene in
6954,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"Gerrald’s trial:—“‘After all,’ he was urging in his defence, ‘the"
6955,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"most useful discoveries in philosophy, the most important changes in"
6956,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"the moral history of man, have been innovations. The Revolution was"
6957,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"an innovation, Christianity itself was an innovation.’ Instantly"
6958,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"upon this, the following interruption took place:—Lord Braxfield:"
6959,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"‘You would have been stopped long before this, if you had not been a"
6960,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"stranger. All that you have been saying is sedition. And now, my"

6962,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,all the benefit of his defence. But ... I cannot sit here as a judge
6963,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,without saying that it is a most indecent defence....’ The juries
6964,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"were packed as never, surely, before, or afterwards.”"

6966,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"With such judges, such juries, and, at least, in two cases, false"

6968,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,result transcends anticipation. In almost every case a light
6969,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,sentence would have amply met the requirements of justice; but the
6970,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,judges all shared Lord Swinton’s opinion that “it is impossible to
6971,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"punish Sedition adequately, now that torture has been abolished”. So"
6972,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"they strove to supply the deficiency by Transportation, a punishment"

6975,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"With respect to Margarot’s trial at Edinburgh, the following is a"

6977,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,
6978,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"“MARGAROT came from the Black Bull [in Leith Street] to be tried,"
6979,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"attended by a procession of the populace and his Convention friends,"
6980,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,with banners and what was called a tree of liberty. This tree was in
6981,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"the shape of the letter M, about twenty feet high and ten wide. The"
6982,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,honour of bearing it up by carrying the two upright poles was
6983,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"assigned to two eminent Conventionalists, and the little culprit"
6984,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"walked beneath the circular placard in the centre, which proclaimed"
6985,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"liberty and equality, &c. I was looking out of a window in the old"
6986,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"Post-Office, which was then the northmost house on the west side of"
6987,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,the North Bridge. I think I see the scene yet. The whole North
6988,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"Bridge, from the Tron Church to the Register Office, was quite empty"
6989,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"at first; not a single creature venturing on that bit of sand, over"
6990,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,which the waves were so soon to break from both ends. The
6991,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,Post-Office and the adjoining houses had been secretly filled with
6992,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"constables, and sailors from a frigate in the roads (I think _The"
6993,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"Hind_, Capt. Cochrane), all armed with sticks and batons. No soldier"
6994,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"appeared, it being determined that this civic insurrection should be"
6995,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"put down by the civil force, unaided, at least, by scarlet. As soon"
6996,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"as the tree, which led the van, emerged from Leith Street, and"
6997,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"appeared at the north end of the bridge, Provost Elder and the"
6998,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,Magistrates issued from some place they had retired to (I believe
6999,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"the Tron Church), and appeared, all robed, at the south end. The day"
7000,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,was good. There was still not one person—I doubt if there was even a
7001,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"dog—on any part of the space, being the whole length of the bridge,"
7002,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,between the two parties. But the rear of each was crammed with
7003,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"people, who filled up every inch as those in front moved on. The"
7004,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"Magistrates were in a line across the street, with the Provost in"
7005,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"the centre, the city officers behind this line, and probably a"
7006,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,hundred loyal gentlemen in the rear of the officers. The two parties
7007,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"advanced steadily towards each other, and in perfect silence, till"
7008,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,they met just about the Post-Office. The Provost stepped forward
7009,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"about a pace, so that he almost touched the front line of the"
7010,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"rebels, when, advancing his cane, he commanded them to retire. This"
7011,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"order probably would not have been obeyed; but, at any rate, it"
7012,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"could not have been obeyed speedily, from the crowd behind. However,"
7013,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"all this was immaterial; for, without waiting one instant to see"
7014,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"whether they meant to retire or not, the houses vomited forth their"
7015,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"bludgeoned contents, and in almost two minutes the tree was"
7016,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"demolished and thrown over the bridge, the street covered with the"
7017,THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.,"knocked down, the accused dragged to the bar, and the insurrection"

7275,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"of which, in July, 1795, SIR SIDNEY SMITH, with the Diamond frigate,"

7295,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"On the 6th May, LIEUT. PRICE received information that an attack was"

7299,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"John Talbot_, and 18–gun brig-sloop, ORESTES, _Capt. W. Haggitt_,"
7300,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,had not been able to approach nearer to the islands than six
7301,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,miles—precisely what the assailants wanted. The attacking force
7302,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"consisted of 52–gun brigs and flat-bottomed boats, having on board,"
7303,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"as was reported, about 6000 men. At day-break, on the 7th, the"
7304,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,flotilla was seen drawn up in a line opposite to the south-west
7305,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"front of the western redoubt; and instantly was opened, upon the"
7306,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"brigs and flats composing it, a fire from 17 pieces of cannon,"
7307,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"consisting of four 4, two 6, and six 24 pounder long guns, and three"
7308,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"24 and two 32–pounder carronades, being all the guns that would"
7309,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"bear. The brigs remained at a distance of from 300 to 400 yards, in"
7310,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"order to batter the redoubt with their heavy long guns, while the"
7311,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"boats, with great resolution, rowed up until within musket-shot of"
7312,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"the battery. But the guns of the latter, loaded with round, grape,"
7313,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"and canister, soon poured destruction amongst these, cutting several"
7314,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"of the boats “into chips,” and compelling all that could keep afloat"
7315,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,to seek their safety in flight. Six or seven boats were seen to go
7316,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"down, and one small flat, No. 13, was afterwards towed in, bottom"
7317,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"upwards. She appeared, by some pieces of paper found in her, to have"
7318,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"had 144 persons on board, including 129 of the second company of the"

7522,XIII.,"statement of this singular adventure of JEAN BON ST. ANDRÉ, we"
7523,XIII.,"discovered, to our great mortification, that it happened at ALGIERS, and"
7524,XIII.,"not at TUNIS. We should have corrected this mistake, but for two"
7525,XIII.,"reasons—first, that ALGIERS would not stand in the verse; and, secondly,"
7526,XIII.,that we are informed by the young man who conducts the Geographical
7527,XIII.,"Department of the _Morning Chronicle_, that both the towns are in"
7528,XIII.,"Africa, or Asia (he is not quite certain which), and, what is more to"
7529,XIII.,"the purpose, that both are peopled by Moors. TUNIS, therefore, may"
7530,XIII.,stand.

7532,XIII.,"[MARSHAL BERNADOTTÉ, the French _Prince of Monté Corvo_, died as CHARLES"
7533,XIII.,"JOHN XIV., _King of Sweden_, 8th March, 1844, in his eighty-first year."
7534,XIII.,"He married, in 1798, EUGENIA-BERNARDINA-DÉSIRÉE DE CLARY, daughter of a"
7535,XIII.,"Marseilles merchant, and sister of MADAME JOSEPH BUONAPARTE (Queen of"
7536,XIII.,"Spain). “She, who was not a common-place person,” says MADAME DE"
7537,XIII.,"RÉMUSAT, in her valuable _Memoirs_, “had before her marriage been very"
7538,XIII.,"much in love with Napoleon, and appears to have always preserved the"
7539,XIII.,memory of that feeling! It has been supposed that her hardly
7540,XIII.,extinguished passion caused her obstinate refusal to leave France.” She
7541,XIII.,"survived her husband many years, and died in Paris, in the Rue d’Anjou"
7542,XIII.,Saint Honoré. Her husband was succeeded on the throne of Sweden by their
7543,XIII.,"son, OSCAR I., who married JOSÉPHINE, _daughter of_ EUGÈNE BEAUHARNAIS,"
7544,XIII.,"Duc de Leuchtenberg, and _granddaughter of the_ EMPRESS JOSEPHINE."
7545,XIII.,
7546,XIII.,BERNADOTTÉ owed his elevation to the throne to the misgovernment of
7547,XIII.,"Gustavus IV., who had brought the nation to the verge of ruin, and who"
7548,XIII.,"was deposed in 1809, when his uncle, the Duke of Sudermania, became king"
7549,XIII.,"as Charles XIII.; and the next year, BERNADOTTÉ was elected _Crown"
7550,XIII.,"Prince_, and successor to the throne."
7551,XIII.,
7552,XIII.,"In 1813, he rendered great assistance to the Allies, for, as Crown"
7553,XIII.,"Prince, he joined the confederacy against France with 30,000 men; and,"
7554,XIII.,"after defeating Marshal Ney, with great loss, on the 6th September, he,"
7555,XIII.,"on the 18th October, with the co-operation of Blücher, again defeated"
7556,XIII.,"him at the decisive Battle of Leipsic; and, on the 19th, the Emperor"
7557,XIII.,"Alexander, the King of Prussia, and the Crown Prince, entered the great"
7558,XIII.,"square of Leipsic, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. He was a"
7559,XIII.,"decided democrat, and hated by Napoleon, but was the only sovereign of"
7560,XIII.,the revolutionary branch who was permitted to retain his dominions after
7561,XIII.,the great reaction in 1814. The choice made of this great soldier of
7562,XIII.,"fortune excited the surprise of all Europe at the time, but the wisdom"
7563,XIII.,of it was soon demonstrated by his prudent conduct. He had distinguished
7564,XIII.,himself from all Napoleon’s other marshals by his clemency in victory.
7565,XIII.,"For half a century before his accession, Sweden had not known the peace"
7566,XIII.,and prosperity in which he left the country on his death.
7567,XIII.,
7568,XIII.,In T. RAIKES’S _Diary_ will be found some interesting anecdotes of
7569,XIII.,BERNADOTTÉ’S gratitude for services rendered him while a young
7570,XIII.,"subaltern. But one is of a more startling nature, as it records his"
7571,XIII.,narrow escape from the death intended for him by the widow of the late
7572,XIII.,"king, who had purposely prepared a poisoned cup of coffee for him, which"
7573,XIII.,she herself presented to him at her own table. Having been suddenly
7574,XIII.,"warned, he succeeded in forcing it upon her. She resolutely accepted her"
7575,XIII.,"fate, and died during the night.—ED.]"

7943,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,"substitute, in lieu of a sober contentment, and regular discharge of the"

8008,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,frequently inculcated by the German dramas which I have had the good

8013,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,popular of these plays (in the same way as Terence was wont to combine
8014,TRANSLATED BY ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.,two stories of Menander’s). The characters are such as the admirers of

8163,ACT I. SCENE I.,with the return of appetite.—The beef of to-morrow will succeed to the

8165,ACT I. SCENE I.,yesterday. But when once the heart has been occupied by a beloved

8347,ACT I. SCENE I.,days!—Hah! the twenty-eighth of August! How does the recollection
8348,ACT I. SCENE I.,of it vibrate on my heart! It was on this day that I took my last
8349,ACT I. SCENE I.,leave of my Matilda. It was a summer evening; her melting hand
8350,ACT I. SCENE I.,"seemed to dissolve in mine, as I prest it to my bosom. Some demon"
8351,ACT I. SCENE I.,whispered me that I should never see her more. I stood gazing on
8352,ACT I. SCENE I.,the hated vehicle which was conveying her away for ever. The tears
8353,ACT I. SCENE I.,were petrified under my eyelids. My heart was crystallized with
8354,ACT I. SCENE I.,agony. Anon—I looked along the road. The diligence seemed to
8355,ACT I. SCENE I.,"diminish every instant; I felt my heart beat against its prison,"
8356,ACT I. SCENE I.,as if anxious to leap out and overtake it. My soul whirled round
8357,ACT I. SCENE I.,as I watched the rotation of the hinder wheels. A long trail of
8358,ACT I. SCENE I.,"glory followed after her, and mingled with the dust; it was the"
8359,ACT I. SCENE I.,"emanation of Divinity, luminous with love and beauty, like the"
8360,ACT I. SCENE I.,splendour of the setting sun; but it told me that the sun of my
8361,ACT I. SCENE I.,"joys was sunk for ever. Yes, here in the depths of an eternal"
8362,ACT I. SCENE I.,"dungeon, in the nursing cradle of hell, the suburbs of perdition,"
8363,ACT I. SCENE I.,"in a nest of demons, where despair in vain sits brooding over the"
8364,ACT I. SCENE I.,putrid eggs of hope; where agony woos the embrace of death; where
8365,ACT I. SCENE I.,"patience, beside the bottomless pool of despondency, sits angling"
8366,ACT I. SCENE I.,"for impossibilities. Yet, even _here_, to behold her, to embrace"
8367,ACT I. SCENE I.,"her! Yes, Matilda, whether in this dark abode, amidst toads and"
8368,ACT I. SCENE I.,"spiders, or in a royal palace, amidst the more loathsome reptiles"
8369,ACT I. SCENE I.,"of a court, would be indifferent to me; angels would shower down"
8370,ACT I. SCENE I.,"their hymns of gratulation upon our heads, while fiends would envy"
8371,ACT I. SCENE I.,"the eternity of suffering love.... Soft, what air was that? it"
8372,ACT I. SCENE I.,seemed a sound of more than human warblings. Again! [_listens
8373,ACT I. SCENE I.,"attentively for some minutes._] Only the wind; it is well,"
8374,ACT I. SCENE I.,"however; it reminds me of that melancholy air, which has so often"

8530,VI.,"We have received, in the course of the last week, several long, and"
8531,VI.,"to say the truth, dull letters, from unknown hands, reflecting in"
8532,VI.,"very severe terms on MR. HIGGINS, for having, as it is affirmed,"
8533,VI.,"attempted to pass upon the world, as a faithful sample of the"
8534,VI.,"productions of the German theatre, a performance no way resembling"
8535,VI.,"any of those pieces which have so late excited, and which bid fair"
8536,VI.,"to engross, the admiration of the British public."
8537,VI.,
8538,VI.,As we cannot but consider ourselves as the guardians of MR.
8539,VI.,"HIGGINS’S literary reputation, in respect to every work of his which"
8540,VI.,"is conveyed to the world through the medium of our paper (though,"
8541,VI.,what we think of the danger of his principles we have already
8542,VI.,"sufficiently explained for ourselves, and have, we trust, succeeded"
8543,VI.,in putting our readers upon their guard against them)—we hold
8544,VI.,"ourselves bound not only to justify the fidelity of the imitation,"
8545,VI.,but (contrary to our original intention) to give a further specimen
8546,VI.,"of it in our present number, in order to bring the question more"
8547,VI.,fairly to issue between our author and his calumniators.
8548,VI.,
8549,VI.,"In the first place we are to observe, that MR. HIGGINS professes to"
8550,VI.,have taken his notion of German plays wholly from the translations
8551,VI.,which have appeared in our language. If _they_ are totally
8552,VI.,"dissimilar from the originals, Mr. H. may undoubtedly have been led"
8553,VI.,"into error; but the fault is in the translators, not in him. That he"
8554,VI.,"does not differ widely from the models which he proposed to himself,"
8555,VI.,"we have it in our power to prove satisfactorily, and might have done"
8556,VI.,"so in our last number, by subjoining to each particular passage of"
8557,VI.,his play the scene in some one or other of the German plays which he
8558,VI.,had in view when he wrote it. These parallel passages were
8559,VI.,faithfully pointed out to us by Mr. H. with that candour which marks
8560,VI.,his character; and if they were suppressed by us (as in truth they
8561,VI.,"were), on our heads be the blame, whatever it may be. Little,"
8562,VI.,"indeed, did we think of the imputation which the omission would"
8563,VI.,"bring upon Mr. H., as in fact our principal reason for it was the"
8564,VI.,"apprehension that, from the extreme closeness of the imitation in"
8565,VI.,"most instances, he would lose in praise for invention more than he"
8566,VI.,would gain in credit for fidelity.
8567,VI.,
8568,VI.,"The meeting between Matilda and Cecilia, for example, in the first"
8569,VI.,"act of _The Rovers_, and their sudden intimacy, has been censured as"
8570,VI.,"unnatural. Be it so. It is taken, _almost word for word_, from"
8571,VI.,"_Stella_, a German (or professedly a German) piece now much in"
8572,VI.,vogue; from which also the catastrophe of MR. HIGGINS’S play is in
8573,VI.,"part borrowed, so far as relates to the agreement to which the"
8574,VI.,"ladies come, as the reader will see by and bye, to share Casimere"
8575,VI.,between them.
8576,VI.,
8577,VI.,The dinner-scene is copied partly from the published translation of
8578,VI.,"_The Stranger_, and partly from the first scene of _Stella_. The"
8579,VI.,"song of Rogero, with which the first act concludes, is admitted on"
8580,VI.,all hands to be in the very first taste; and if no German original
8581,VI.,"is to be found for it, so much the worse for the credit of German"
8582,VI.,literature.
8583,VI.,
8584,VI.,An objection has been made by one anonymous letter-writer to the
8585,VI.,"names of Puddingfield and Beefington, as little likely to have been"
8586,VI.,assigned to English characters by any author of taste or
8587,VI.,"discernment. In answer to this objection we have, in the first"
8588,VI.,"place, to admit, that a small, and we hope not an unwarrantable,"
8589,VI.,alteration has been made by us since the MS. has been in our hands.
8590,VI.,"These names stood originally Puddincrantz and Beefinstern, which"
8591,VI.,"sounded to our ears as being liable, especially the latter, to a"
8592,VI.,ridiculous inflection—a difficulty that could only be removed by
8593,VI.,furnishing them with English terminations. With regard to the more
8594,VI.,"substantial syllables of the names, our author proceeded, in all"
8595,VI.,"probability, on the authority of Goldoni, who, though not a German,"
8596,VI.,"is an Italian writer of considerable reputation; and who, having"
8597,VI.,heard that the English were distinguished for their love of liberty
8598,VI.,"and beef, has judiciously compounded the two words _Runnymede_ and"
8599,VI.,"_Beef_, and thereby produced an English nobleman, whom he styles"
8600,VI.,_Lord Runnybeef_.
8601,VI.,
8602,VI.,"To dwell no longer on particular passages, the best way perhaps of"
8603,VI.,explaining the whole scope and view of Mr. H.’s imitation will be to
8604,VI.,transcribe the short sketch of the plot which that gentleman
8605,VI.,"transmitted to us, together with his drama, and which it is perhaps"
8606,VI.,"the more necessary to give at length, as, the limits of our paper"
8607,VI.,"not allowing of the publication of the whole piece, some general"
8608,VI.,"knowledge of its main design may be acceptable to our readers, in"
8609,VI.,order to enable them to judge of the several extracts which we lay
8610,VI.,before them.

8618,PLOT.,"Professor of Civil Law; and Matilda evidently returning his passion,"
8619,PLOT.,"the Doctor, to prevent ill consequences, sends his daughter on a"
8620,PLOT.,"visit to her aunt in Wetteravia, where she becomes acquainted with"
8621,PLOT.,"Casimere, a Polish Officer, who happens to be quartered near her"
8622,PLOT.,"aunt’s, and has several children by him."
8623,PLOT.,
8624,PLOT.,"Roderic, Count of Saxe Weimar, a prince of a tyrannical and"

8626,PLOT.,"Gaspar, a crafty villain, who had risen to his post by first"
8627,PLOT.,"ruining, and then putting to death, Rogero’s father. Gaspar,"
8628,PLOT.,apprehensive of the power and popularity which the young Rogero may
8629,PLOT.,"enjoy at his return to Court, seizes the occasion of his intrigue"
8630,PLOT.,with Matilda (of which he is apprized officially by Doctor
8631,PLOT.,Pottingen) to procure from his master an order for the recall of
8632,PLOT.,"Rogero from college, and for committing him to the care of the Prior"
8633,PLOT.,"of the Abbey of Quedlinburgh, a priest, rapacious, savage, and"
8634,PLOT.,"sensual, and devoted to Gaspar’s interests—sending at the same time"
8635,PLOT.,private orders to the Prior to confine him in a dungeon.
8636,PLOT.,
8637,PLOT.,Here Rogero languishes many years. His daily sustenance is
8638,PLOT.,"administered to him through a grated opening at the top of a cavern,"
8639,PLOT.,"by the landlady of the Golden Eagle at Weimar, with whom Gaspar"
8640,PLOT.,"contracts, in the prince’s name, for his support; intending, and"
8641,PLOT.,"more than once endeavouring, to corrupt the waiter to mingle poison"
8642,PLOT.,"with the food, in order that he may get rid of Rogero for ever."
8643,PLOT.,
8644,PLOT.,"In the meantime, Casimere, having been called away from the"
8645,PLOT.,"neighbourhood of Matilda’s residence to other quarters, becomes"
8646,PLOT.,"enamoured of and marries Cecilia, by whom he has a family; and whom"
8647,PLOT.,"he likewise deserts after a few years’ cohabitation, on pretence of"
8648,PLOT.,business which calls him to Kamtschatka.
8649,PLOT.,
8650,PLOT.,"Doctor Pottingen, now grown old and infirm, and feeling the want of"
8651,PLOT.,"his daughter’s society, sends young Pottingen in search of her, with"
8652,PLOT.,strict injunctions not to return without her; and to bring with her
8653,PLOT.,"either her present lover Casimere, or, should that not be possible,"
8654,PLOT.,"Rogero himself, if he can find him; the Doctor having set his heart"
8655,PLOT.,upon seeing his children comfortably settled before his death.
8656,PLOT.,"Matilda, about the same period, quits her aunt’s in search of"
8657,PLOT.,"Casimere; and Cecilia, having been advertised (by an anonymous"
8658,PLOT.,"letter) of the falsehood of his Kamtschatka journey, sets out in the"
8659,PLOT.,post-waggon on a similar pursuit.
8660,PLOT.,
8661,PLOT.,It is at this point of time the Play opens—with the accidental
8662,PLOT.,meeting of Cecilia and Matilda at the Inn at Weimar. Casimere
8663,PLOT.,"arrives there soon after, and falls in first with Matilda, and then"
8664,PLOT.,"with Cecilia. Successive _éclaircissements_ take place, and an"
8665,PLOT.,"arrangement is finally made, by which the two ladies are to live"
8666,PLOT.,jointly with Casimere.
8667,PLOT.,
8668,PLOT.,"Young Pottingen, wearied with a few weeks’ search, during which he"
8669,PLOT.,"has not been able to find either of the objects of it, resolves to"
8670,PLOT.,"stop at Weimar, and wait events there. It so happens that he takes"
8671,PLOT.,"up his lodgings in the same house with Puddingfield and Beefington,"
8672,PLOT.,"two English noblemen, whom the tyranny of King John has obliged to"
8673,PLOT.,"fly from their country; and who, after wandering about the continent"

8676,PLOT.,"The news of the signature of Magna Charta arriving, determines"
8677,PLOT.,Puddingfield and Beefington to return to England. Young Pottingen
8678,PLOT.,"opens his case to them, and entreats them to stay to assist him in"
8679,PLOT.,the object of his search.—This they refuse; but coming to the Inn
8680,PLOT.,"where they are to set off for Hamburgh, they meet Casimere, from"
8681,PLOT.,whom they had both received many civilities in Poland.
8682,PLOT.,
8683,PLOT.,"Casimere, by this time tired of his “DOUBLE ARRANGEMENT,” and having"
8684,PLOT.,learnt from the waiter that Rogero is confined in the vaults of the
8685,PLOT.,"neighbouring abbey _for love_, resolves to attempt his rescue, and"
8686,PLOT.,to make over Matilda to him as the price of his deliverance. He
8687,PLOT.,"communicates his scheme to Puddingfield and Beefington, who agree to"
8688,PLOT.,"assist him; as also does young Pottingen. The Waiter of the Inn,"
8689,PLOT.,"proving to be a _Knight Templar_ in disguise, is appointed leader of"
8690,PLOT.,"the expedition. A band of Troubadours, who happen to be returning"
8691,PLOT.,"from the Crusades, and a company of Austrian and Prussian Grenadiers"
8692,PLOT.,"returning from the Seven Years’ War, are engaged as troops."
8693,PLOT.,
8694,PLOT.,The attack on the Abbey is made with success. The Count of Weimar
8695,PLOT.,"and Gaspar, who are feasting with the Prior, are seized and beheaded"

8697,PLOT.,Rogero is rescued. Matilda and Cecilia rush in. The former
8698,PLOT.,"recognises Rogero, and agrees to live with him. The children are"

9518,“BUONAPARTÉ.”,with the ardour of Freedom. Already has the Altar of Liberty been
9519,“BUONAPARTÉ.”,reared in the _Caffrarian_ and _Equinoctial Republics_. Their
9520,“BUONAPARTÉ.”,regenerated inhabitants have sworn eternal amity to us at a Civic

10022,—THE TEMPEST.,—THE TEMPEST.
10023,—THE TEMPEST.,
10024,—THE TEMPEST.,We have now completed our Engagement with the Public. The ANTI-JACOBIN
10025,—THE TEMPEST.,has been conducted to the close of the Session in strict conformity with
10026,—THE TEMPEST.,the Principles upon which it was first undertaken.
10027,—THE TEMPEST.,
10028,—THE TEMPEST.,Its reception with the Public has been highly favourable:—it certainly
10029,—THE TEMPEST.,has been out of proportion to any merit which has appeared in the
10030,—THE TEMPEST.,execution of the Work. This is not said in the mere cant of Authorship.
10031,—THE TEMPEST.,We are sensible that much of our success has been owing to the improved
10032,—THE TEMPEST.,"state of the Public mind;—an improvement existing from other causes, and"
10033,—THE TEMPEST.,"to which, if We have in any degree contributed, it has in return"
10034,—THE TEMPEST.,"operated to our advantage, by a reaction more than equal to any"
10035,—THE TEMPEST.,"impression which our exertions could have produced. There is, however,"
10036,—THE TEMPEST.,one species of merit to which We lay claim without hesitation:—We mean
10037,—THE TEMPEST.,"that of the Spirit and Principles upon which We have acted. That Spirit,"
10038,—THE TEMPEST.,We trust We shall leave behind us. The SPELL of _Jacobin
10039,—THE TEMPEST.,invulnerability_ is now broken.[306]
10040,—THE TEMPEST.,
10041,—THE TEMPEST.,"We know from better authority than that of CAMILLE JORDAN, that one of"
10042,—THE TEMPEST.,"our Daily Papers was, _early_ in the French Revolution, purchased by"
10043,—THE TEMPEST.,"France, and devoted to the dissemination of tenets, which, at the period"
10044,—THE TEMPEST.,"to which We allude, seemed necessary to the success of the Ruling Party."
10045,—THE TEMPEST.,
10046,—THE TEMPEST.,For some time matters went on swimmingly. The Editors of the favoured
10047,—THE TEMPEST.,Prints divided their time and their attention between _London_ and
10048,—THE TEMPEST.,"_Paris_; and the superiority of the governing Party in France, over its"
10049,—THE TEMPEST.,"Opponents, was as duly, and as strenuously maintained in the English"
10050,—THE TEMPEST.,"Papers, as in the “_Journal du Père de Chène_,”[307] “_Journal par L’Ami"
10051,—THE TEMPEST.,"du Peuple_,”[308] or any other Journal that issued from the Presses of"
10052,—THE TEMPEST.,the Jacobin Society.
10053,—THE TEMPEST.,
10054,—THE TEMPEST.,"As the principles of the Revolution, however, acquired consistency in"
10055,—THE TEMPEST.,"France, the struggle between the Governing Party and its Opponents"
10056,—THE TEMPEST.,"became an object of less moment, and the Jacobins had leisure, as they"
10057,—THE TEMPEST.,"long had had inclination, to turn their views to this Country."
10058,—THE TEMPEST.,
10059,—THE TEMPEST.,"A State, enjoying under a Government which they had proscribed as"
10060,—THE TEMPEST.,"utterly incapable of producing either, as much freedom and happiness as"
10061,—THE TEMPEST.,"comport with the nature of Man, was too bitter a satire on the decision"
10062,—THE TEMPEST.,"of these new SOLONS, to be regarded with patience; and the pens which"
10063,—THE TEMPEST.,had been so industriously employed in celebrating the plunderers and
10064,—THE TEMPEST.,"perturbators of France, were now engaged in the benevolent design of"
10065,—THE TEMPEST.,"recommending their principles, and their plans of ameliorating the"
10066,—THE TEMPEST.,"condition of the human race by Atheism and Plunder, to the serious"
10067,—THE TEMPEST.,notice of the People of _Great Britain_.
10068,—THE TEMPEST.,
10069,—THE TEMPEST.,Affairs seemed rapidly hastening to a crisis: _France_ saw with delight
10070,—THE TEMPEST.,"the numbers seduced by the sophistry of her Writers, and by the alluring"
10071,—THE TEMPEST.,"prospects of proscription and plunder; and her Agents, who snuffed the"
10072,—THE TEMPEST.,"scent of blood like Vultures, already anticipated the Revolution which"
10073,—THE TEMPEST.,"they now believed inevitable; when the Ministry, who had viewed the"
10074,—THE TEMPEST.,"progress of the evil with an anxious but unterrified eye, roused"
10075,—THE TEMPEST.,"themselves into unexampled energy, and called on the Nation to rally"
10076,—THE TEMPEST.,round the Constitution which they had received from their Forefathers.
10077,—THE TEMPEST.,
10078,—THE TEMPEST.,The call was gloriously answered;—Thousands and tens of thousands sprung
10079,—THE TEMPEST.,forth in its defence; and the barbarous hordes which so lately
10080,—THE TEMPEST.,"threatened its destruction, overawed by their numbers, shrunk from the"
10081,—THE TEMPEST.,"contest without a struggle, and vanished from the field."
10082,—THE TEMPEST.,
10083,—THE TEMPEST.,But the nature of a Jacobin is restless. His hatred of all subordination
10084,—THE TEMPEST.,"is unbounded, and his thirst of plunder and blood urgent and insatiable."
10085,—THE TEMPEST.,In arms he found himself infinitely too weak to obtain his purpose; he
10086,—THE TEMPEST.,"must, therefore, have recourse again to artifice; and by fallacies and"
10087,—THE TEMPEST.,"lies, endeavoured to subvert and betray the judgment of those he could"
10088,—THE TEMPEST.,not openly hope to subdue.
10089,—THE TEMPEST.,
10090,—THE TEMPEST.,"For this purpose, the Press was engaged, and almost monopolized in all"
10091,—THE TEMPEST.,"its branches: Reviews, Registers, Monthly Magazines, and Morning and"
10092,—THE TEMPEST.,"Evening Prints, sprung forth in abundance."
10093,—THE TEMPEST.,
10094,—THE TEMPEST.,Of these last (the only Publications with which We have any immediate
10095,—THE TEMPEST.,"concern), it is not too much to say, that they have laboured in the"
10096,—THE TEMPEST.,"cause of infamy, with a perseverance which no sense of shame could"
10097,—THE TEMPEST.,"repress, and no dread of punishment overcome. The objects committed to"
10098,—THE TEMPEST.,"their charge were multifarious. They were to revile all Religions, but"
10099,—THE TEMPEST.,"particularly the Christian, whose DIVINE FOUNDER was to be blasphemously"
10100,—THE TEMPEST.,"compared to _Bacchus_, and represented as equally ideal, or, if real,"
10101,—THE TEMPEST.,"more bestial and besotted! They were to magnify the power of _France_,"
10102,—THE TEMPEST.,on all occasions; to deny her murders; to palliate her robberies; to
10103,—THE TEMPEST.,"suppress all mention of her miseries, and to hold her forth to the"
10104,—THE TEMPEST.,"unenlightened Englishman as the mirror of justice, and truth, and"
10105,—THE TEMPEST.,"generosity, and meekness, and humanity, and moderation, and tender"
10106,—THE TEMPEST.,"forbearance:—and, on the other hand, they were to depreciate the spirit,"
10107,—THE TEMPEST.,"and the courage, and the resources of _England_: they were to impede, if"
10108,—THE TEMPEST.,"possible, and if not, to ridicule and revile, every measure which the"
10109,—THE TEMPEST.,"honour, the prosperity, or the safety of the Country might imperiously"
10110,—THE TEMPEST.,require; they were to represent the Government as insidiously aiming to
10111,—THE TEMPEST.,"enslave the Nation, by every attempt to maintain its Independence; and"
10112,—THE TEMPEST.,"the majority of both Houses, the great body of Proprietors, as anxious"
10113,—THE TEMPEST.,"to scatter and confound that wealth, which _their_ Patrons alone, the"
10114,—THE TEMPEST.,"respectable sweepings of _Craven-House_, and the _Crown_ and _Anchor_"
10115,—THE TEMPEST.,"Tavern, were solicitous to augment and preserve."
10116,—THE TEMPEST.,
10117,—THE TEMPEST.,"These, our readers will allow, were no common objects, and if they have"
10118,—THE TEMPEST.,"looked into the _Morning Chronicle_, _Morning Post_, and _Courier_"
10119,—THE TEMPEST.,"Journals to which our attention has been chiefly directed, they must"
10120,—THE TEMPEST.,have seen that their attainment was sought by no common means; by an
10121,—THE TEMPEST.,"_invariable_ course of Falsehood and Misrepresentation—such, at least,"
10122,—THE TEMPEST.,"was our idea on the first perusal of these Papers, an idea which every"
10123,—THE TEMPEST.,succeeding one served to strengthen and confirm.
10124,—THE TEMPEST.,
10125,—THE TEMPEST.,"To detect and expose this Falsehood, and to correct this"
10126,—THE TEMPEST.,"Misrepresentation, became at length an object of indispensable"
10127,—THE TEMPEST.,necessity: a variety of applications of the most malignant nature had
10128,—THE TEMPEST.,"obtained currency and credit, from the unblushing impudence with which"
10129,—THE TEMPEST.,"they were first obtruded on the Public by the Agents of Sedition, and"
10130,—THE TEMPEST.,the apathy with which they were suffered to pass uncontradicted by those
10131,—THE TEMPEST.,"who despised them for their atrocity, or ridiculed them for their"
10132,—THE TEMPEST.,folly:—these were unfortunately operating on the less enlightened part
10133,—THE TEMPEST.,of the Nation; and it was from a full conviction of the pernicious
10134,—THE TEMPEST.,"effects they were calculated to produce, that we finally determined to"
10135,—THE TEMPEST.,step forth (after patiently waiting to see whether the business would
10136,—THE TEMPEST.,"not be taken up by abler hands), and to oppose such antidotes to the"
10137,—THE TEMPEST.,"evil, as a regard for truth, and a sincere love and veneration for the"
10138,—THE TEMPEST.,"Constitution under which we have flourished for ages, could supply."
10139,—THE TEMPEST.,
10140,—THE TEMPEST.,How we have succeeded must be left to the judgment of the Public. If we
10141,—THE TEMPEST.,"might venture, indeed, to conjecture from the support which we have"
10142,—THE TEMPEST.,"experienced, the result would be flattering in an unusual degree. Three"
10143,—THE TEMPEST.,"complete Editions of our Paper (a circumstance, we believe, as yet"
10144,—THE TEMPEST.,"without a precedent) have been disposed of, and the demand for them"
10145,—THE TEMPEST.,still increases.
10146,—THE TEMPEST.,
10147,—THE TEMPEST.,"But the motives of Profit, as will readily, we believe, be granted to"
10148,—THE TEMPEST.,"us, have little influence on our minds: we contemplate the extensive"
10149,—THE TEMPEST.,"circulation of our Paper with pleasure, solely from the consideration of"
10150,—THE TEMPEST.,the VAST NUMBERS of our Countrymen whom we have fortified by our
10151,—THE TEMPEST.,"animadversions against the profligate attacks of the Agents of Sedition,"
10152,—THE TEMPEST.,"whether furnished by the _Whig Club_, the _Corresponding Society_, or"
10153,—THE TEMPEST.,the _Directory of France_.
10154,—THE TEMPEST.,
10155,—THE TEMPEST.,Calculation was not originally our delight. Nor was it till after we saw
10156,—THE TEMPEST.,the wonderful effects which it produced in the pages of the Jacobinical
10157,—THE TEMPEST.,"Arithmeticians that we were tempted to adopt it. Our first Essay,"
10158,—THE TEMPEST.,"however, was crowned with the most complete success. In our Seventh"
10159,—THE TEMPEST.,"Number, we gave (still following the laudable example of the Jacobins,"
10160,—THE TEMPEST.,"who, when a Ship is to be fitted out, or a Regiment raised, for the"
10161,—THE TEMPEST.,"purpose of defending our Country from an insolent and barbarous foe,"
10162,—THE TEMPEST.,nicely calculate how many idle mouths might be fed by the sums
10163,—THE TEMPEST.,"required)—We gave, we say, as accurate a statement as we could form, of"
10164,—THE TEMPEST.,the number of People that might be supplied with wholesome food for one
10165,—THE TEMPEST.,"day, by the SURCHARGE levied on the DUKE OF BEDFORD—a statement which,"
10166,—THE TEMPEST.,"we are happy to add, placed the matter in so clear a light that we have"
10167,—THE TEMPEST.,since had no occasion to repeat it.
10168,—THE TEMPEST.,
10169,—THE TEMPEST.,Our Readers will not _now_ be surprised if we again have recourse to
10170,—THE TEMPEST.,_Calculation_ to prove the advantages which (we love to flatter
10171,—THE TEMPEST.,ourselves) have been derived from our Paper. Our Sale (to say nothing of
10172,—THE TEMPEST.,the new Editions which have been disposed of) has regularly amounted to
10173,—THE TEMPEST.,"_Two Thousand Five Hundred_ a week; on an average of several Papers, we"
10174,—THE TEMPEST.,"find the Lies which have been detected to amount to _six_, and the"
10175,—THE TEMPEST.,Misrepresentations and Mistakes to _an equal number_. This furnishes a
10176,—THE TEMPEST.,"total of _twelve_, which, multiplied by _thirty-five_, the number of the"
10177,—THE TEMPEST.,"last ANTI-JACOBIN, gives a total of _four hundred and twenty_."
10178,—THE TEMPEST.,
10179,—THE TEMPEST.,If we now take the number of Subscribers (2500) and multiply them by
10180,—THE TEMPEST.,"seven, a number of which every one’s family may be reasonably supposed"
10181,—THE TEMPEST.,"to consist, we shall have a product of 17,500; but as many of these have"
10182,—THE TEMPEST.,"made a practice, which we highly approve, and cannot too earnestly"
10183,—THE TEMPEST.,"recommend, of lending our Papers to their poorer Neighbours, We must"
10184,—THE TEMPEST.,"make our addition to the sum which We evidently take too low at 32,500."
10185,—THE TEMPEST.,"We have thus an aggregate of 50,000 People, a most respectable minority"
10186,—THE TEMPEST.,"of the Readers of the whole Kingdom, who have been put effectually on"
10187,—THE TEMPEST.,"their guard, by our humble though earnest endeavours, against the"
10188,—THE TEMPEST.,"artifices of the seditious, and the more open attacks of the profligate"
10189,—THE TEMPEST.,"and abandoned Foes of their Constitution, their Country, and their God."

10196,—THE TEMPEST.,
10197,—THE TEMPEST.,We have more than once repeated that we entered upon this part of our
10198,—THE TEMPEST.,"task, not from any vain hope of convincing the Writers themselves. We"
10199,—THE TEMPEST.,"knew this to be impossible; the forehead of a _Jacobin_, like the shield"
10200,—THE TEMPEST.,"of AJAX, is formed of seven bull-hides, and utterly incapable of any"
10201,—THE TEMPEST.,impression of shame or remorse—but we are convinced that we have
10202,—THE TEMPEST.,"rescued, as we stated above, Fifty Thousand persons from their"
10203,—THE TEMPEST.,"machinations, and taught them not only a salutary distrust, but a"
10204,—THE TEMPEST.,"contempt and disbelief, of every laboured article which appears in the"
10205,—THE TEMPEST.,Papers of this description.
10206,—THE TEMPEST.,

10210,—THE TEMPEST.,four hundred and twenty times repeated (this being the fair amount of
10211,—THE TEMPEST.,"the number of Lies, &c., We have detected)—an agglomeration of impulse"
10212,—THE TEMPEST.,which no prejudice could resist and no preconceived partialities weaken
10213,—THE TEMPEST.,or remove.
10214,—THE TEMPEST.,
10215,—THE TEMPEST.,Here then We rest. We trust We have “done the State some service”;—We
10216,—THE TEMPEST.,have driven the Jacobins from many strongholds to which they most
10217,—THE TEMPEST.,"tenaciously held.[309] We have exposed their Principles, detected their"
10218,—THE TEMPEST.,"Motives, weakened their Authority, and overthrown their Credit. We have"
10219,—THE TEMPEST.,"shewn them in every instance, ignorant, and designing, and false, and"
10220,—THE TEMPEST.,"wicked, and turbulent, and anarchical—various in their language, but"
10221,—THE TEMPEST.,"united in their plans, and steadily pursuing through hatred and"
10222,—THE TEMPEST.,"contempt, the destruction of their Country."
10223,—THE TEMPEST.,
10224,—THE TEMPEST.,With this impression on the Minds of our Readers WE TAKE OUR LEAVE of
10225,—THE TEMPEST.,them. Their welfare is in their own hands; if they suffer the Jacobins
10226,—THE TEMPEST.,"to regain any of the influence of which We have deprived them, they will"
10227,—THE TEMPEST.,compromise their own Safety; but WE shall be blameless—_Liberavimus

10783,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,
10784,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,"At present, there is but one relation among all the States of"

10800,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,
10801,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,"The relation in which we may stand to the other States of Europe, or"

10808,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,question does not lie there.—_France_ has the power and the will to
10809,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,"controul, to oppress them altogether; to limit or extend their"
10810,FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.,"Boundaries, as she sees good; to approve or annul their Internal"

10938,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,“It is well known that the French Revolution turned the brains of many
10939,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"of the noblest youths in England. Indeed when such men as COLERIDGE,"

10941,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"partook of their sensibility, but had a very small portion of their"
10942,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"intellect, were carried away. Many were ruined by the errors into which"
10943,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,they were betrayed; many also lived to smile at the follies of their
10944,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"youth. ‘I am no more ashamed of having been a Republican,’ said SOUTHEY,"
10945,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,‘than I am of having been a child.’ The opinions held led to many
10946,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"political prosecutions, and I naturally had much sympathy with the"
10947,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"sufferers. I find in my journal, Feb. 21, 1799 (says Crabb Robinson):"
10948,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,‘An interesting and memorable day. It was the day on which GILBERT
10949,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"WAKEFIELD was convicted of a seditious libel, and sentenced to two"
10950,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"years’ imprisonment. This he suffered in Dorchester Gaol, which he left"
10951,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"only to die. Originally of the Established Church, he became a"
10952,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Unitarian, and Professor at the Hackney College. By profession he was a"
10953,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,scholar. His best known work was an edition of Lucretius. He had written
10954,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,against PORSON’S edition of the _Hecuba_ of Euripides.’ It is said that
10955,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"PORSON was at a dinner-party at which toasts were going round, and a"
10956,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"name, accompanied by an appropriate sentence from Shakespeare, was"
10957,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,required from each of the guests in succession. Before PORSON’S turn
10958,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"came, he had disappeared beneath the table, and was supposed to be"
10959,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"insensible to what was going on. This, however, was not the case, for"
10960,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"when a toast was required of him, he staggered up and gave: ‘Gilbert"
10961,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Wakefield—what’s _Hecuba_ to him, or he to _Hecuba_?’ WAKEFIELD was a"
10962,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,political fanatic. He had the pale complexion and mild features of a
10963,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Saint, was a most gentle creature in domestic life, and a very amiable"
10964,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"man; but when he took part in any religious or political controversy,"
10965,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,his pen was dipped in gall. The occasion of the imprisonment before
10966,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"alluded to was a letter in reply to WATSON, Bishop of Llandaff, who had"
10967,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,written a pamphlet exhorting the people to loyalty. WAKEFIELD asserted
10968,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"that the poor, the labouring classes; could lose nothing by French"
10969,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"conquest. Referring to the fable of the Ass and the Trumpeter, he said:"

11052,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"was a physician of some ability, and on being exiled from his native"
11053,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"island of Sardinia for abandoning the Roman Catholic religion, had taken"
11054,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,up his residence in Switzerland; and married a Swiss Protestant. JEAN
11055,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,PAUL was the eldest of three sons; his next brother settled down as a
11056,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"watchmaker at Geneva, and his youngest brother entered the service of"
11057,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"the Empress Catherine, and distinguished himself in the Russian army"
11058,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,under the title of the Chevalier de Boudry. JEAN PAUL was from his
11059,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"childhood of an intensely sensitive and excitable disposition, and also"
11060,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"so quick at his books that he became a good classical scholar, and"
11061,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"acquainted with most modern languages. As his chief taste, however,"
11062,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"seemed to be for natural science, he was intended to follow his father’s"
11063,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"profession, and was, at the age of eighteen, sent to study medicine at"
11064,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,the University of Bordeaux. He there obtained a thorough knowledge of
11065,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"his profession, but devoted himself particularly to the sciences of"
11066,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"optics and electricity. From Bordeaux he went to Paris, where he"
11067,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"effected a remarkable cure of a disease of the eyes, which had been"
11068,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"abandoned as hopeless both by physicians and quacks, by means of"
11069,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"electricity. From Paris he went to Amsterdam, and, finally, to LONDON,"
11070,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"where he set up in practice in _Church Street, Soho_, then one of the"
11071,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,most fashionable districts in London. He must soon have formed a good
11072,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"practice, for he stopped in London, with occasional visits to Dublin and"
11073,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Edinburgh, for ten years, and only left it to take up an appointment at"
11074,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"the French court. While in London he wrote his first book, and in 1772"
11075,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"and 1773, he published the first two volumes of a philosophical and"
11076,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,physiological _Essay on Man_. The point he discussed was the old problem
11077,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"of the relation between body and mind, and he treated it in a very"
11078,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,interesting manner from the physiological point of view. He held some
11079,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,extraordinary theory about the existence of some fluid in the veins
11080,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"which acted on the mind; which, however, does not impair the interest of"
11081,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"his inquiries into the cause of dreams, or diminish the respect felt for"
11082,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,his wide reading and extensive knowledge both of ancient and modern
11083,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,philosophical and medical authors. He shows a wide knowledge of Latin
11084,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"and Greek literature, and while writing in good English freely quotes"
11085,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"French, German, Italian, and Spanish writers. In one part of his book he"
11086,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,declared that it was ridiculous for any one to make psychical researches
11087,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"without having some knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and openly"
11088,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,attacked HELVÉTIUS for despising scientific knowledge in his famous _De
11089,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"l’Esprit_. VOLTAIRE naturally took the side of HELVÉTIUS, and did the"
11090,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"young author the honour of noticing, and very severely criticising, his"
11091,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"book. MARAT himself translated it into French, and published it at"
11092,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,Amsterdam in 1775. His next work was of a political character. He had
11093,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"got mixed up with some of the popular societies in England, which were"
11094,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,striving to obtain a thorough reform of the representation of the people
11095,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"in the House of Commons, and, in 1774, published a work, which he"
11096,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"entitled THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY. In this book, which is partly historical"
11097,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"and partly political, he begs the electors to take more care in the"
11098,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,choice of their representatives. It is written in a very declamatory
11099,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"style, and strikes the note of the responsibility of representatives to"
11100,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"their constituents, which is the key-note of all his political ideas."
11101,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"The book is published in quarto, and is printed on fine paper, so that"
11102,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"it can hardly have been meant to appeal to the populace, but it,"
11103,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"nevertheless, procured him the honorary membership of the popular"
11104,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,societies of _Newcastle_ and other great northern cities. Subsequently
11105,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"he again returned to his profession, and after publishing a medical"
11106,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"tract in 1775, of which no copy is known to exist, he published _An"
11107,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Inquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of a singular Disease of the"
11108,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Eyes_, in 1776. [See _Academy_ of September 23, 1882.] In this little"
11109,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,pamphlet there is no violent language; it describes the disease and the
11110,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"cases he had cured in perfectly simple language, and shows, at least,"
11111,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"that he was no mere quack, but a scientific physician. On June 30, 1775,"
11112,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"he had, while on a visit to _Scotland_, received the honorary degree of"
11113,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"M.D. from the _University of St. Andrews_ for his eminence as a doctor,"
11114,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"and had probably received similar compliments from other Universities,"
11115,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"because, on June 24, 1777, JEAN PAUL MARAT, ‘médecin de plusieurs"
11116,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"facultés d’Angleterre,’ was appointed, for his good character and high"
11117,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"reputation as a doctor, physician to the body-guard of the Comte"
11118,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"d’Artois, with a salary of a thousand livres a year and allowances. To"
11119,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"take up this court appointment he moved to Paris, and soon acquired a"
11120,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"large practice there, and the name of ‘physician of the incurables,’"
11121,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,from the number of hopeless cases he was successful in treating. He also
11122,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"moved in the best society about the court, and won the affections of the"
11123,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"_Marquise de l’Aubespine_ for saving her life. For some reason or other,"
11124,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"most probably because he had obtained a competent fortune, and desired"
11125,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"to satisfy his ambition, he resigned his court appointment in 1783, and"
11126,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"devoted himself to science. He had long observed the phenomena of Heat,"
11127,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"Light, and Electricity, and in the course of the next five years"
11128,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"published the result of his experiments, and presented them to the"
11129,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,_Academy of Sciences_. His hard work won him the friendship of BENJAMIN
11130,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"FRANKLIN, but the violence with which he attacked his adversaries, and"
11131,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"his audacity in doubting the conclusions of NEWTON, prevented him from"
11132,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,obtaining a seat in the Academy of Sciences. When he recognised that
11133,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"this hostility to himself prevented due recognition of his work, he"
11134,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,determined to win the approbation of the Academy by concealing his name;
11135,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"and his translation of the _Optics_ of NEWTON, which was covered by the"
11136,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"name of _M. de Beauzée_, and published in 1788, was at once crowned by"
11137,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,the very Academy which had rejected him.
11138,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,
11139,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"“His political work during these years was confined to a treatise, in"
11140,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"imitation of BECCARIA, on the subject of Punishments. The approach of"
11141,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"the States-General, however, revived his political enthusiasm, and in"
11142,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"the March of 1789, when he believed himself to be dying, he published"
11143,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"his _Offrande à la Patrie_, which was followed in quick succession by a"
11144,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"supplement and other pamphlets. Of these, distinctly the most able is"
11145,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"the _Tableau des Vices de la Constitution Anglaise_, which he presented"
11146,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"to the Assembly in September, 1789. In it he points out what he had"
11147,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"learnt in the popular societies of England, that the English people was"
11148,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,by no means so well governed as it was supposed to be; that the
11149,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,influence of the king and the ministry was overwhelming through the
11150,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"extent of patronage, and that the rich there bought seats in the House"
11151,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,of Commons as they bought estates.
11152,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,
11153,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,“MARAT then felt that he could not express himself frequently enough in
11154,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"pamphlets, and on September 12 appeared the first number of a journal"
11155,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"written entirely by himself, called the JOURNAL DU PEUPLE, which title"
11156,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"was changed to that of _Ami du Peuple_, or _The People’s Friend_, with"
11157,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,the fourth number.

11161,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"he attacked everybody, and attacked them all with unaccustomed violence;"
11162,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"but with all this, he was in private life a highly educated gentleman."
11163,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"The extent of his attainments appears from his numerous works, and it"
11164,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,must be remembered that he could not for years have been a fashionable
11165,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,physician and held a court appointment without being perfectly polite
11166,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,and well-bred. His faults arose from his irritable and suspicious
11167,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"nature, and years of persecution made him half-insane towards the end of"
11168,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"his life; but in September, 1789, he was in perfect possession of his"
11169,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,"senses, and the very popularity of his journal showed how congenial his"
11170,NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.,gospel of suspicion was to the Parisians.”—[ED.]

11198,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,These (_Gr._ “Lovers of Gods and Men”) were a sect of _Deists_ which
11199,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,appeared in France amid the confusion and disorder of the first
11200,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Revolution. While the State was indifferent to all forms of Religion,"
11201,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,and the Republican Directory was afraid of the Christianity which
11202,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"prevailed in the Church, a felt consciousness of the necessity of some"

11204,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,Religion.

11206,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"“This Sect” (says SOUTHEY, in the _Quarterly Review_, vol. xxviii.)"
11207,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,“began with more circumstances in their favour than ever occurred to
11208,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,facilitate the establishment of a religion or of a sect. Many persons of
11209,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"considerable influence and reputation engaged in the project with zeal,"
11210,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"and it was patronised by LA RÉVEILLÈRE LÊPAUX, one of the Directory...."
11211,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,His motives for putting himself at the head of the Theophilanthropists
11212,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"are said to have been twofold: if the scheme succeeded, he intended to"
11213,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,become their High Priest; and he hated Christianity. Through his means
11214,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,the Theophilanthropists obtained a decree from the Government giving
11215,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"them a right of holding their meetings in the Churches, as national"
11216,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"buildings, which were open to any religion, but belonged to none."
11217,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,
11218,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,“Nearly twenty Churches in Paris were taken possession of; but by
11219,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"occupying so many, they injured themselves.... They took up too extended"
11220,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"a position, and had neither numbers nor means answerable to the scale"
11221,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"upon which they set out.... Their _Service_ began at noon, and lasted"
11222,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"about an hour and a half. It was, they said, a worship for those who had"
11223,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"no other, and a moral society for those who had. The _Ritual_ consisted"
11224,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"of Prayers, Hymns original or selected from the best French Poets,"
11225,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"readings from their Manual, and Discourses. The _Hymns_ were, in"
11226,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"general, judicious, and set to good music, and the _Prayers_ well"
11227,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,composed; but had their books been stript of all that they had borrowed
11228,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"from the Gospel, and from the works of Christian writers, they would"
11229,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,have been meagre indeed. In one part of the Service there was a short
11230,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"pause, during which the congregation were expected to consider each in"
11231,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,silence what his own conduct had been since the last of these meetings.
11232,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"A basket of fruit or flowers, according to the season, was placed upon"
11233,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"the altar, as a mark of acknowledgment for the bounties of the Creator;"
11234,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"and over the altar was the inscription, _Nous croyons à l’existence de"
11235,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Dieu, et à l’immortalité de l’âme_.... LA RÉVEILLÈRE, in a speech at the"
11236,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Institute, declaiming against Christianity, as being opposed to the"
11237,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"liberty of mankind, expressed his wish that a form of religion were"
11238,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"adopted, which should have only _a couple of articles_. He wished also"
11239,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"for a religion without priests; and this, it was pleasantly observed,"

11252,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,solace
11253,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"their old age. Fathers and mothers, instruct your children."
11254,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Wives, behold in your husbands the heads of your houses. Husbands, love"
11255,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"your wives, and render yourselves mutually happy.’"
11256,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,
11257,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"“At _Marriage_ the bride and bridegroom were to be coupled with ribands,"
11258,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"or garlands of flowers, the ends of which were to be held on each side"
11259,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,by the elders of their respective families. The Bride received a ring
11260,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"from her husband, and a medal of union from the head of the family."
11261,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"There was a rite also for infants.... When a member _died_, the other"
11262,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"members of the Society were invited to place a flower upon the urn, and"
11263,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,pray the Creator to receive the deceased into his bosom. The Decades and
11264,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"National Holidays were observed by these Anti-Christians, and they had"
11265,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"four Holidays of their own, for Socrates, St. Vincent de Paule, Jean"
11266,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Jacques Rousseau, and Washington,—oddly assorted names! Two of them,"
11267,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"however, stand well together in this kalendar, for the one, who was a"
11268,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Christian, established the Foundling Hospital at Paris; and the other,"
11269,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"who was a sentimentalist, a philosopher, and a Theophilanthropist, sent"

11272,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"“LA RÉVEILLÈRE used to take praise to himself for having, in his"

11274,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Anti-Christian language of the Directory, and its persecution of the"
11275,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Clergy, are imputed to him; so far his colleagues were willing to go"
11276,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,with him; but his zeal for Deism they regarded as ridiculous.... In the
11277,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"way of pecuniary aid, he could obtain little:—_beaucoup d’argent_ was"

11282,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,the persons thus assembled were idlers. But this concourse soon abated;
11283,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"there was nothing attractive in the ceremonies, nothing to impose upon"
11284,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,the imagination or the senses. A propagandist reported from Montreuil

11289,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"with blue flowers, before an altar upon which an orange tree was placed:"

11296,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,[The literary association of LAMB with COLERIDGE and SOUTHEY [says SIR

11298,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"young scorners of _The Anti-Jacobin_, who, luxuriating in boyish pride"
11299,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"and aristocratic patronage, tossed the arrows of their wit against all"
11300,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"charged with innovation, whether in politics or poetry, and cared little"
11301,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,whom they wounded. No one could be more innocent than LAMB of political
11302,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,heresy; no one more strongly opposed to new theories in morality—which
11303,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,he always regarded with disgust. The very first number of _The
11304,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine_ [this was, however, a new work, by"
11305,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"different hands, but imbued with the same spirit as _The Anti-Jacobin_]"
11306,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"was adorned by a caricature of GILLRAY’S, in which COLERIDGE and SOUTHEY"
11307,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"were introduced with asses’ heads, and LLOYD and LAMB as toad and frog."
11308,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"In the number of July, 1798 [of the original _Anti-Jacobin_] appeared"
11309,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"the well-known poem of _New Morality_, in which all the prominent"
11310,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,objects of the hatred of these champions of religion and order were
11311,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"introduced as offering homage to LEPAUX, a French charlatan,—of whose"

11319,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"[The cause of Coleridge, Southey, Lloyd, and Lamb, being thus satirized"
11320,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"as persons of the same politics, was the conjoint publication of their"
11321,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"works. In the spring of 1796, COLERIDGE published vol. i. of his"
11322,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"_Juvenile Poems_, including three Sonnets by LAMB; in May, 1797, there"
11323,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"appeared a new edition, with many poems by LLOYD and LAMB. _The Fall of"
11324,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Robespierre_, an historic drama, was published Sept. 22, 1794: the first"
11325,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"act written by COLERIDGE, the second and third by SOUTHEY. It is not"
11326,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,difficult to understand why COLERIDGE was so severely attacked by the
11327,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Government writers. In 1795, at the early age of 23, he delivered, at"
11328,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"Bristol, some public lectures, reflecting in warm terms on the measures"
11329,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,of PITT. Three of them were published at Bristol at the end of 1795—the
11330,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"first two together, with the title of _Conciones ad Populum_; the third"
11331,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,as _The Plot Discovered_. The eloquent passage in conclusion of the
11332,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,first of these addresses was written by SOUTHEY. That he was considered
11333,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,by ministers a dangerous character is proved by his having been for some
11334,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"months watched by a Government spy while residing at Stowey, providing"
11335,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,for his scanty maintenance by writing verses for _The Morning Post_. It
11336,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"was his fortune also to excite the ire of BUONAPARTE, by his"
11337,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,anti-gallican writings in the same paper; and a benevolent intimation of
11338,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,his danger by Baron von Humboldt and Cardinal Fesch alone prevented his
11339,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,being arrested while in Italy. (See p. 284.)

11341,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"SOUTHEY thus alludes to the attack upon him (by GILLRAY, in his famous"
11342,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"caricature), in a letter addressed to C. W. W. WYNN, dated Hereford,"
11343,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"August 15, 1798:—“I have seen myself _Bedfordized_, and it has been a"
11344,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,subject of much amusement. HOLCROFT’S likeness is admirably preserved. I
11345,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,know not what poor LAMB has done to be croaking there. What I think the
11346,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,worst part of _The Anti-Jacobin_ abuse is the lumping together men of
11347,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,such opposite principles; this was stupid. We should have all been
11348,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"welcoming the _Director_, not the _Theophilanthrope_. The conductors of"
11349,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,_The Anti-Jacobin_ will have much to answer for in thus inflaming the
11350,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,animosities of this country. They are labouring to produce the deadly
11351,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,hatred of Irish faction; perhaps to produce the same end. Such an
11352,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,address as you mention might probably be of great use; that I could
11353,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,assist you in it is less certain. I do not feel myself at all calculated
11354,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,for anything that requires methodical reasoning; and though you and I
11355,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"should agree in the main object of the pamphlet, our opinions are at"
11356,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"root different. The old systems of government, I think, must fall; but"
11357,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"in this country the immediate danger is on the other hand,—from an"
11358,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,unconstitutional and unlimited power. BURLEIGH saw how a Parliament
11359,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"might be employed against the people, and MONTESQUIEU prophesied the"
11360,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,fall of English liberty when the Legislature should become corrupt. You
11361,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,will not agree with me in thinking his prophecy fulfilled. Violent men
11362,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"there undoubtedly are among the democrats, as they are always called;"
11363,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,but is there any one among them whom the ministerialists will allow to

11390,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"of them all, but HARE the most brilliant. BURKE’S conversation was"
11391,THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.,"delightful, so luminous and instructive. He was very passionate; and"

11428,THE COURIER.,"THE COURIER, in the time of the war, was the great paper; it obtained a"
11429,THE COURIER.,"large circulation, and consequently exercised considerable influence. It"
11430,THE COURIER.,"was started by JOHN PARRY in 1792, and he carried it on for some years"
11431,THE COURIER.,"with tolerable success, till he was ruined in 1799 by a government"
11432,THE COURIER.,prosecution for a libel on the Emperor of Russia. It was bought by
11433,THE COURIER.,"DANIEL STUART, who left _The Morning Post_ for _The Courier_ in 1803."
11434,THE COURIER.,"During three years, says he, at the time of the overthrow of BUONAPARTE,"
11435,THE COURIER.,"_The Courier_, by the able management of PETER STREET, who was editor"
11436,THE COURIER.,"and half-proprietor, sold steadily upwards of 8000 per day; during one"
11437,THE COURIER.,"fortnight it sold upwards of 10,000 daily. At the end of 1809, S. T."
11438,THE COURIER.,COLERIDGE contributed to it some Essays on the Spaniards; and in 1811 he
11439,THE COURIER.,wrote for it on a salary. At this time the paper was much under
11440,THE COURIER.,ministerial direction. From about the year 1818 till 1829 _The Courier_
11441,THE COURIER.,"was conducted by W. MUDFORD, with whom WILLIAM STEWART was a proprietor."
11442,THE COURIER.,"After 1819 D. STUART took no interest in it, and parted with his last"
11443,THE COURIER.,"share in it in 1822. After the year 1825, JAMES STUART, a Scotch"
11444,THE COURIER.,gentleman of great talent and respectability—the same that unfortunately
11445,THE COURIER.,"killed SIR ALEXANDER BOSWELL in a duel, and was author of _Travels in"
11446,THE COURIER.,"the United States_—became editor. True to his principles, he gave in"
11447,THE COURIER.,this capacity every support in his power to the Whig or Liberal party.
11448,THE COURIER.,He was appointed by LORD MELBOURNE to the situation of Factory
11449,THE COURIER.,"Inspector, which he held till his death, at the age of 74, in 1849. When"
11450,THE COURIER.,"JAS. STUART obtained his factory appointment, SAM. LAMAN BLANCHARD"
11451,THE COURIER.,"became editor. The paper having become, like other evening papers, less"
11452,THE COURIER.,"profitable than of old, the proprietors sold it to the party they had so"
11453,THE COURIER.,"long opposed. It took Tory politics; LAMAN BLANCHARD, of course,"
11454,THE COURIER.,resigned; and a few short years were sufficient to destroy a journal
11455,THE COURIER.,which had once been the most valuable newspaper property in England. Its

11467,THE COURIER.,features _The Anti-Jacobin_ and _The Rolliad_. The verses are chiefly
11468,THE COURIER.,"parodies of Moore’s _Irish Melodies_, or of Byron’s songs, and are far"
11469,THE COURIER.,above the ordinary level of such compositions.... The various pieces

11473,THE COURIER.,This statement contains several inaccuracies. The pieces forming _The

11475,THE COURIER.,"1815_, for BYRON’S _Fare thee well_ was not written till April, 1816."
11476,THE COURIER.,The parody on it was entitled _The Leader’s Lament. By the Right Hon.
11477,THE COURIER.,George Ponsonby_. A. Hayward says in his review of _The Poetry of the
11478,THE COURIER.,"Anti-Jacobin_, in _The Edinburgh Review_, 1858—that “CANNING has been"
11479,THE COURIER.,"traditionally credited with the parody of Moore’s. _Believe me, if all"
11480,THE COURIER.,"those endearing young charms_, the gentleman addressed being a"
11481,THE COURIER.,"distinguished commoner afterwards ennobled (the first LORD METHUEN), who"
11482,THE COURIER.,was far from meriting the character [of a foolish fop] thereby fastened
11483,THE COURIER.,"on him”. The other parodies were by JOHN CALCRAFT, the Hon. W. H."
11484,THE COURIER.,"LYTTELTON, DUDLEY NORTH, M.P., KIRKMAN FINLAY, M.P. for Glasgow, &c. MR."
11485,THE COURIER.,"METHUEN, in return, wrote many clever squibs and parodies against the"
11486,THE COURIER.,"Tories, which were collected, under the title of _The New Tory Guide_,"
11487,THE COURIER.,"and reproduced, like its rivals in 1819. “Talking of _The Morning"
11488,THE COURIER.,"Chronicle_,” says T. MOORE (_Diary, 19th March, 1831_), “PAUL METHUEN"
11489,THE COURIER.,told us he was the author of almost all those about _The Rat Club_;

11497,THE STAR.,"first editor was ANDREW MACDONALD, author of _Vimonda_, a tragedy, and"
11498,THE STAR.,"other works: and after him another Scottish poet, John Mayne, author of"
11499,THE STAR.,"_The Siller Gun_, was editor. ROBERT BURNS was offered an engagement to"
11500,THE STAR.,"write poetry for it, at the rate of one guinea an article per week. The"
11501,THE STAR.,arrangement was not completed. It was to PETER STUART that BURNS
11502,THE STAR.,"addressed his “Poem, written to a gentleman who had sent him a"
11503,THE STAR.,"Newspaper, and offered to continue it free of expense”. The facetious"
11504,THE STAR.,"Bob Allen, of whom Charles Lamb has such pleasant reminiscences, was for"
11505,THE STAR.,"many years a contributor to this paper. Subsequently, DR. A. TILLOCH,"
11506,THE STAR.,"editor of _The Philosophical Magazine_, was for many years editor of"
11507,THE STAR.,"_The Star_. After Oct. 15, 1831, _The Star_ became incorporated with"

11527,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,
11528,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"Woodfall, in addition to other talents requisite to the success of a"

11541,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"named GRAY, who had just received a legacy of £500. With that joint"

11543,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"PERRY a present of a house in the Strand, which he converted into a new"

11546,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"satirized in _The Anti-Jacobin_, and who was a subscriber to the fund,"
11547,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"informed the editor of the present work, was £300."
11548,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,
11549,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"PERRY was on good terms with his contributors, and made _The Morning"
11550,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,Chronicle_ a more prosperous and influential journal than had ever
11551,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"before been known in England. GRAY provided the heavy articles, PERRY"
11552,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"those of lighter sort; and after GRAY’S death, which happened when he"
11553,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"had been part proprietor for only a few years, other writers were"
11554,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"employed, among them JAS. MACKINTOSH and SHERIDAN, and in later times T."

11556,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"young barrister, who was the Theatrical Critic, and was still so in"
11557,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"1810. T. CAMPBELL, on coming to London in 1802, was engaged as a"
11558,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"political writer, but this not being his forte, he, with great judgment,"
11559,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"confined himself to poetical pieces, among which were _Ye Mariners of"
11560,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"England_, and _The Exile of Erin_. PERRY had another and equally famous"
11561,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"contributor. In Sept., 1793, S. T. COLERIDGE, then aged nineteen, “sent"
11562,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"a poem of a few lines to PERRY, soliciting a loan of a guinea for a"
11563,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"distressed author,” which prayer was immediately granted. In 1796, he"
11564,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"accepted an offer of Perry’s to write in it, but the arrangement was"
11565,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"never carried out. In later years, COLERIDGE wrote some other poems for"

11594,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,_The Chronicle_ lingered on as a would-be Peelite organ till the autumn

11597,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"continued to support in it the Peelite policy, he should have the money"
11598,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"back with interest, being paid £3000 a year for three years. That"
11599,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"contract soon fell through, as GLOVER preferred to draw a subsidy from"
11600,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"LOUIS NAPOLEON, and to make other experiments. At the close of 1854, the"
11601,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"circulation of _The Morning Chronicle_ averaged only about 2500, while"
11602,THE MORNING CHRONICLE.,"that of _The Morning Post_ was about 3000, that of _The Morning Herald_"

11651,THE MORNING POST.,"WOLCOT continued to be the chief writer; and who, besides his clever"
11652,THE MORNING POST.,"verses, gave much information upon affairs of the prize-ring and kindred"
11653,THE MORNING POST.,"amusements. In 1795, TATTERSALL sold the entire copyright, with house"
11654,THE MORNING POST.,"and printing materials, for £600. The circulation then was only 350"
11655,THE MORNING POST.,daily.
11656,THE MORNING POST.,
11657,THE MORNING POST.,"The purchaser was MR. DANIEL STUART; and MR. CHRISTIE, the auctioneer,"
11658,THE MORNING POST.,"was also a proprietor. Previous to this time, ROBERT BURNS was applied"
11659,THE MORNING POST.,"to, to supply poetry, but none was ever sent. DANIEL STUART was not"
11660,THE MORNING POST.,twenty-nine when he bought _The Morning Post_; and JAMES (afterwards SIR
11661,THE MORNING POST.,"JAS.) MACKINTOSH, who was his brother-in-law, and was a regular"
11662,THE MORNING POST.,"contributor, was his senior only by a year."
11663,THE MORNING POST.,
11664,THE MORNING POST.,"After 1790, the same ANDREW MACDONALD, who had been editor of _The"
11665,THE MORNING POST.,"Star_, furnished poems, as did WORDSWORTH, SOUTHEY, C. LLOYD, and other"
11666,THE MORNING POST.,"verse writers. At the commencement of 1798, S. T. COLERIDGE—then only"
11667,THE MORNING POST.,"twenty-five—was engaged to contribute poetry. The Odes, _Fire, Famine,"
11668,THE MORNING POST.,and Slaughter_; _France_; _Dejection_; and that on _The Departing Year_;
11669,THE MORNING POST.,"with twenty or thirty other pieces, since included in his Poetical"
11670,THE MORNING POST.,"Works, among which was _Love_—one of the most popular poems of this"
11671,THE MORNING POST.,age—were first published in _The Morning Post_. To these must be added
11672,THE MORNING POST.,"the first draught of _The Devil’s Thoughts_, a piece afterwards much"
11673,THE MORNING POST.,"altered. About 1800, the paper was supplied with some excellent pieces,"
11674,THE MORNING POST.,"in prose, including Fashionable Intelligence, short pungent articles,"
11675,THE MORNING POST.,"and jokes, by CHARLES LAMB."
11676,THE MORNING POST.,
11677,THE MORNING POST.,In 1798 its sale was over 2000; and so well had DANIEL STUART managed
11678,THE MORNING POST.,"his property—being exceedingly well served by his principal assistant,"
11679,THE MORNING POST.,"GEORGE LANE—that when he left _The Morning Post_ for _The Courier_, in"
11680,THE MORNING POST.,"1803, the circulation amounted to 4,500. It, therefore, stood higher in"
11681,THE MORNING POST.,"point of sale than any other morning paper, the order in respect of"
11682,THE MORNING POST.,"numbers from high to low being this: _Morning Post_, _Morning Herald_,"
11683,THE MORNING POST.,"_Morning Advertiser_, _Times_. The amount received for it was about"
11684,THE MORNING POST.,"£25,000. According to JOHN TAYLOR, editor of _The Sun_, in his _Records"
11685,THE MORNING POST.,"of my Life_, _The Morning Post_ was afterwards purchased by Government"
11686,THE MORNING POST.,to silence attacks on the PRINCE REGENT.
11687,THE MORNING POST.,
11688,THE MORNING POST.,Much of the success of _The Morning Post_ was undoubtedly owing to the
11689,THE MORNING POST.,writings of COLERIDGE. He afterwards declared that he had wasted the
11690,THE MORNING POST.,prime and manhood of his intellect in writing for _The Morning Post_ and
11691,THE MORNING POST.,"_Courier_. Among his contributions to the former (March 19, 1800) was"
11692,THE MORNING POST.,his famous character of WILLIAM PITT. The last time he wrote in it was
11693,THE MORNING POST.,"in August, 1802."
11694,THE MORNING POST.,
11695,THE MORNING POST.,"A very competent judge, THOMAS DE QUINCEY, thus alludes to COLERIDGE’S"
11696,THE MORNING POST.,"political writings:—“Worlds of fine thinking,” he says of the daily"
11697,THE MORNING POST.,"press, “lie buried in that vast abyss, never to be disentombed, or"
11698,THE MORNING POST.,"restored to human admiration. Like the sea, it has swallowed treasures"
11699,THE MORNING POST.,"without end, that no diving-bell will bring up again. But nowhere"
11700,THE MORNING POST.,throughout its shoreless magazines of wealth does there lie such a bed
11701,THE MORNING POST.,"of pearls, confounded with the rubbish and ‘_purgamenta_’ of ages, as in"
11702,THE MORNING POST.,the political papers of COLERIDGE. No more appreciable monument could be
11703,THE MORNING POST.,"raised to the memory of COLERIDGE, than a re-publication of his Essays"
11704,THE MORNING POST.,"in _The Morning Post_, but still more of those afterwards published in"
11705,THE MORNING POST.,_The Courier_.” These have since been reprinted under the title of
11706,THE MORNING POST.,_Essays on his own Times_.

12022,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,Americans: for a considerable length of time he combated alone a
12023,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"host of foes, “himself a host”; stemmed the impetuous tide of"
12024,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"democracy; and checked the irruptions of French anarchy and atheism,"
12025,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"which threatened to overwhelm the American States, and, with the"
12026,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"ruins of their confliction, to crush everything for which the"
12027,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"Americans, at the period of their revolution, professed to fight,"
12028,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,and which they have ever since professed to cherish. The adoption of
12029,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,such a line of conduct was alone sufficient to draw down upon our
12030,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,author the vengeance of all whose treasonable designs his manly
12031,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"efforts were intended to defeat. Accordingly, nothing was spared by"
12032,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,the infuriated advocates of anarchy to injure him in the public
12033,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"mind, and, by blasting his reputation, to deprive him of that credit"
12034,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,which was indispensably necessary to secure the success of his
12035,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"works. No imputation however base, no lie however atrocious, none of"
12036,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"those black and diabolical arts, in short, which, issuing from the"
12037,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"bubbling cauldron of democracy, were so skilfully employed to"
12038,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"blacken the first and fairest character in France, as a necessary"
12039,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,prelude to the establishment of the _virtuous_ republic of the Great
12040,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"Nation, were neglected in the _glorious_ attempt to achieve the ruin"
12041,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of this worthy individual. When these were found to fail of
12042,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"producing the desired effect, recourse was had to personal"
12043,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"threats—the coward’s weapon—with the hope of inducing him, by the"
12044,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"means of intimidation, to quit a country in which his enemies"
12045,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,endeavoured to convince him that his life was daily exposed to most
12046,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"imminent danger. But neither the dread of calumny, nor the fear of"
12047,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"assassination, could lead the object of their persecution to forego"
12048,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"his laudable design. He manfully persevered, and has at length,"
12049,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"though not without infinite difficulty, succeeded in opening the"
12050,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"eyes of the Americans to their own interest, and in the infamous"
12051,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"machinations of France, and of American traitors in the pay of"
12052,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,France—for England is not the ONLY country in which foreign gold is
12053,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,employed as a stimulus to domestic treason.[330] In the course of
12054,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"his exertions to produce this desirable end, honest Peter had"
12055,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,occasion to comment on the pusillanimous conduct of the Spanish
12056,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"monarch, in bending the knee to, and forming an alliance with, the"
12057,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"base plunderers and assassins of his family, and on the insidious"
12058,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,and criminal efforts of the Spanish ambassador to strengthen the
12059,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"hands of the French faction in America. These comments, it seems,"
12060,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"excited the indignation of Don Carlos Martinez de Trojo, who"
12061,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,determined to bring the author to condign punishment; and it was the
12062,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,very unwarrantable conduct which the latter experienced on the
12063,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,occasion that gave rise to the publication before us.
12064,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12065,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,PETER begins his tract by stating the dangers to which he knew
12066,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"himself exposed, on account of his political principles, when he"
12067,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"established his residence in the state of Pennsylvania, “where the"
12068,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"government, generally speaking, was in the hands of those who had"
12069,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,(and sometimes with great indecency) manifested an uniform
12070,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"partiality for the sans-culotte French, and as uniform an opposition"
12071,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,to the ministers and measures of the federal government”. That men
12072,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"should ever be placed in situations of trust and importance, whose"
12073,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,principles are avowedly adverse to the constitution whence they
12074,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"derive their subsistence, and which it is their bounden duty to"
12075,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"protect, is a circumstance that would excite universal astonishment"
12076,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"if it did not, unhappily, so often occur. Still the frequency of its"
12077,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"occurrence does not alter its nature, nor should it be allowed to"
12078,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,diminish that ample portion of censure which must ever attach to the
12079,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,authors of such appointments. It is such conduct as this that
12080,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,justifies one of the wisest observations that ever fell from the pen
12081,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of Voltaire—“A GOVERNMENT CAN ONLY PERISH BY SUICIDE”—an observation
12082,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,confirmed by the fate of every country that has been recently
12083,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,reduced beneath the iron yoke of republican France.
12084,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12085,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"Aware of his danger, our author thought the best means of averting"
12086,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"it was, by seeking for some standard, as a safe rule for his conduct"
12087,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,in respect to the liberty of this press. “The English press was said
12088,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"to be _enslaved_; but, when I came to consult the practice of this"
12089,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"enslaved press, I found it still to be far too free for me to"
12090,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"attempt to follow its example. Finally, it appeared to me to be the"
12091,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"safest way, to form to myself some rule founded on the liberty"
12092,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,exercised by the _American press_. I concluded that I might without
12093,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,danger go as great lengths in attacking the enemies of the country
12094,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,as others went in attacking its friends: that as much zeal might be
12095,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,shown in defending the general government and administration as in
12096,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,accusing and traducing them: and that as great warmth would be
12097,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"admissible in the cause of virtue, order, and religion, as had been"
12098,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"tolerated in the wicked cause of villainy, insurrection, and"
12099,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"blasphemy” (p. 21). Alas! Peter, at this time, knew but little of"
12100,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the “spirit and temper,” as MR. BARRISTER ERSKINE would express it,"
12101,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of democracy and Jacobinism. He knew not that the men who profess
12102,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"those principles are for the most part vindictive, malignant,"
12103,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"oppressive, and intolerant; and that under the mask of liberty they"
12104,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,exercise the most insupportable tyranny over their families and
12105,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"dependents, and that in their general conduct to their"
12106,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"inferiors—unless when impelled by interest or urged by ambition,"
12107,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"they irritate their passions with toasts and flattery, from a"
12108,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"tavern-chair, or influence their minds by seditious discourses and"
12109,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"treasonable insinuations, from a tribune or a scaffold—they are"
12110,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"supercilious, arrogant, insolent, and overbearing. He knew not, it"
12111,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"would seem, that those whose whole duty is to defend the laws often"
12112,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"_sleep on their posts_, while their enemies are ever vigilant,"
12113,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"active, and alert; that when the former are attacked, a tardiness of"
12114,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"zeal, amounting nearly to torpor, secures, with few exceptions,"
12115,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,impunity to the assailant; whereas any exposure of the latter draws
12116,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,forth a malignity of revenge which is the certain fore-runner of
12117,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"persecution. Indeed, the inveteracy of the discontented, of that"
12118,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,class which includes all those who aspire to the possession of place
12119,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"and power, and are little scrupulous about the means of attaining"
12120,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,them; and all the determined revolutionists or subverters of
12121,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"established institutions, may be traced to a natural source. Unable"
12122,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"to support by reason a cause which reason disavows, unable to"
12123,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,strengthen by arguments positions which set all argument at
12124,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"defiance, it becomes their business to inflame by passion and to"
12125,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,dazzle with sophistry. Hence arises an extreme facility of exposing
12126,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"their weakness and detecting their infamy, and not having the means"
12127,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"of resisting such exposure, being wholly destitute of the sentiments"
12128,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"which are necessary for a successful reply, they are reduced to the"
12129,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,degrading alternative of abandoning the field to a triumphant
12130,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"adversary, or of seeking, by the adoption of violent measures, to"
12131,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,punish the opponent whom they did not dare to encounter. This it is
12132,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,that renders revenge an active principle in _their_ minds.
12133,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12134,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,The first step taken by the Spanish ambassador was an application to
12135,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,the federal government to prosecute our author “for certain matters
12136,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"published in his Gazette against himself and that poor, unfortunate,"
12137,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"and humbled mortal, Charles IV., King of Spain”. The government"
12138,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"consented, and Peter was accordingly bound over to appear in the"
12139,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"federal district court before _Judge Peters_. Don Carlos, however,"
12140,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"soon found that his prosecution would be more likely to succeed, if"
12141,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"brought in a district where the defendant had more personal enemies,"
12142,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,and where the people were more generally disposed to the adoption of
12143,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"revolutionary principles. A memorial was, accordingly, “delivered in"
12144,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"to the federal government, requesting that the trial might come on"
12145,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, of which Court _McKean is"
12146,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,Chief Justice_”. Of this _republican_ Judge our author gives such an
12147,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,account as must convey to English minds a strange idea of the
12148,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,administration of _republican_ Justice. It is to be found in P.
12149,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"22—When Britons contemplate the character here delineated, and"
12150,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,contrast it with the characters of their own Judges to which even
12151,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,the licentious tongue of faction has not dared to impute the
12152,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"smallest stain, their bosoms must glow with satisfaction of the most"
12153,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,exalted kind; they must exult in the superior excellence of that
12154,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,form of government and of those laws which effectually secure them
12155,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"from the evils of a vicious, corrupt, or partial distribution of"
12156,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,justice. After giving an historical detail of the proceedings
12157,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"against him, accompanied by copies of the warrant to apprehend him,"
12158,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the imputed libels, the bill of indictment, and the Judge’s charge,"
12159,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"Peter exclaims—“This, when it comes to be served up in Britain, will"
12160,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"be a dish for a king. The royalists will lick their lips, and the"
12161,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"republicans will cry, God bless us! The emigrations _for liberty’s"
12162,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"sake_ will cease, and we shall have nothing but the pure"
12163,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"unadulterated dregs of Newgate and the Fleet, the candidates for"
12164,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,Tyburn and Botany Bay—Blessed cargo! All _patriots_ to the backbone:
12165,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,true philanthropists and universal citizens: fit for any place but
12166,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,England in this world and heaven in the next!”
12167,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12168,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"But, notwithstanding the Judge’s charge, the most partial and"
12169,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"scandalous charge, we conceive, that ever was delivered _out of"
12170,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"France_, the Grand Jury refused to find the bill, and the"
12171,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"prosecution of course ceased. The Judge, not less disappointed than"
12172,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the prosecutor, on this occasion, took an early opportunity—to his"
12173,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,infamy be it recorded!—of declaring from the Bench that the Grand
12174,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,Jury would not _do their duty_. What would the disaffected in this
12175,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,country say were any British Judge to use such language? The gross
12176,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,imputations cast upon the character of our author by this
12177,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"_impartial_ Judge, have extorted from Peter a tribute of justice to"
12178,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,himself which the occasion most amply justifies. As the account here
12179,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,given perfectly accords with all the information we have received
12180,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"from persons of undoubted veracity who know him well, and as it"
12181,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"fully corroborates the opinion we ourselves have formed of him, from"
12182,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"an attentive perusal of his publications, we shall extract it for"
12183,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,the satisfaction of our readers:—“It hardly ever becomes a man to
12184,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,say much of his private character or concerns; but on this occasion
12185,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"I trust I shall be indulged for a moment. I will say, and I will"
12186,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"make that saying good, whosoever shall oppose it, that I never"
12187,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"attacked any one, whose private character is not, in every light in"
12188,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,which it can possibly be viewed as far beneath mine as infamy is
12189,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"beneath honour. Nay, I defy the city of Philadelphia, populous as it"
12190,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"is, and respectable as are many of its inhabitants, to produce me a"
12191,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"single man who is more sober, industrious, or honest; who is a"
12192,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"kinder husband, a tenderer father, a better master, a fonder friend,"
12193,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,or (though last not least) a more zealous and faithful subject.
12194,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12195,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,“Most certainly it is unseemly in any one to say this much of
12196,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,himself unless compelled to it by some public outrage on his
12197,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,character; but when the accusation is made notorious so ought the
12198,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"defence; and I do again and again repeat, that I fear not a"
12199,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,comparison between my character and that of any man in this city:
12200,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"no, not even with that of the very Judge, who held me as the worst"
12201,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"of miscreants. His Honour is welcome, if he please, to carry this"
12202,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"comparison into _all_ the actions of our lives, public and"
12203,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"_domestic_, and to extend it beyond ourselves to _every branch of"
12204,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,our families_.
12205,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12206,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"“As to my writing, I never did slander any one, if the promulgation"
12207,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of useful truths be not slander. Innocence and virtue I have often
12208,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"endeavoured to defend, but I never defamed either. I have, indeed,"
12209,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,stripped the close-drawn veil of hypocrisy; I have ridiculed the
12210,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"follies, and lashed the vices of thousands, and have done it"
12211,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,sometimes perhaps with a rude and violent hand. But these are not
12212,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the days for gentleness and mercy. Such as is the temper of the foe,"
12213,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,such must be that of his opponent. Seeing myself published as a
12214,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"rogue, _and my wife a whore_; being persecuted with such infamous,"
12215,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,such base and hellish calumny in the _philanthropic_ city of
12216,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"Philadelphia, merely for asserting _the truth_ respecting others,"
12217,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"was not calculated, I assure you, to sweeten my temper, and turn my"
12218,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,ink into honey-dew.
12219,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12220,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"“My attachment to order and good government, nothing but the"
12221,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,impudence of Jacobinism can deny. The object not only of my own
12222,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"publications, but also of all those which I have introduced or"
12223,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"encouraged, from the first moment that I appeared on the public"
12224,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"scene to the present day, has been to lend some aid in stemming the"
12225,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"torrent of anarchy and confusion. To undeceive the misguided, by"
12226,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,tearing the mask from the artful and ferocious villains who owing to
12227,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the infatuation of the poor, and the supineness of the rich, have"
12228,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,made such fearful progress in the destruction of all that is amiable
12229,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,and good and sacred among men. To the government of this country in
12230,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,particular it has been my constant study to yield all the support in
12231,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"my power. When that government, or the worthy men who administer it"
12232,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"have been traduced and vilified, I have stood forward in their"
12233,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"defence, and that too, in times when its friends were some of them"
12234,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"locked up in silence, and others giving way to the audacious"
12235,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,violence of its foes. Not that I am so foolishly vain as to
12236,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,attribute to my illiterate voter a thousandth part of the merit my
12237,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,friends are inclined to allow it. As I wrote the other day to a
12238,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"gentleman who had paid me some compliments on this score, ‘I should"
12239,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,never look on my family with a dry eye if I did not hope to outlive
12240,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,my works’. They are mere transitory beings to which the
12241,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"revolutionary storm has given life, and which with that storm will"
12242,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"expire. But, what I contend for and what nobody can deny, I have"
12243,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"done all that laid in my power, all that I was able by any means to"
12244,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,accomplish in order to counteract the nefarious effects of the
12245,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,enemies of the American government and nation.
12246,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12247,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"“With respect to religion, altho’ Mr. M’Kean was pleased to number"
12248,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,it among the things that were in danger from the licentiousness of
12249,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the press, and of course from poor _me_, I think it would puzzle the"
12250,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"devil himself to produce from my writings, a single passage, which"
12251,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"could, by all the powers of perversion be twisted into an attack"
12252,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"upon it. But it would on the contrary be extremely easy to prove,"
12253,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"that I have at all times, when an opportunity offered, repelled the"

12256,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,with all my strength. The bitterest drop in my pen has ever been
12257,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"bestowed upon them; because, of all the foes of the human race, I"
12258,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"look upon them, after the devil, as being the greatest and most"
12259,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,dreadful. Not a sacrilegious plunderer from Henry VIII. to
12260,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"Condorcet, and from Condorcet to the impious Sans-culottes of"
12261,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"France, has escaped my censure. All those, who have attempted to"
12262,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,degrade religion whether by open insults and cruelties to the
12263,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"clergy, by blasphemous publications or by the more dangerous poison"
12264,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"of the malignant modern philosophy, I have ranked amongst the most"
12265,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"infamous of mankind, and have treated them accordingly.”"
12266,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,
12267,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,In the concluding part of his tract the author clearly convicts the
12268,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,Judge of the most decided and most flagrant partiality. He quotes a
12269,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"number of infamous libels, on religious and political subjects,"
12270,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"which had never roused the indignation, nor even excited the"
12271,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"censure, of those whose duty it is to preserve the public peace and"
12272,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"to enforce a due observance of the laws. If, indeed, we were to"
12273,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"judge, from this specimen, of the mode of administring justice in"
12274,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"America, in matters of libel, we should conclude, that every degree"
12275,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of licentiousness is allowed to those who seek to debauch the minds
12276,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"of the people, to seduce them from their allegiance, and to dissolve"
12277,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,every tie which religion and morality have formed for the happiness
12278,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"of men in a social state, while the upright supporters of virtue,"
12279,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,whose labours are directed to the prevention of anarchy and
12280,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"rebellion, by detecting the views and exposing the machinations of"
12281,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"their abettors, are the sole objects not merely of _pro_secution but"
12282,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of _per_secution.

12284,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,The abuse bestowed on the mild and beneficent sovereigns of these
12285,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"realms by the Democratic factions in the American Congress, is"
12286,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,almost equal in severity to the censures lavished by some members of
12287,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"opposition during the _last_ parliament in the British Senate, on"
12288,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the Kings of Prussia and Hungary, _before_ those monarchs had become"

12371,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,he promises hereafter to expose more fully (a promise which we trust
12372,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,he will not forget); and then introduces the following curious
12373,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"anecdote, which we extract for the benefit of the Doctor’s political"
12374,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,friends and admirers in Europe. “But since the Doctor wrote that
12375,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,letter it seems experience has changed his opinion. He has suffered
12376,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,the just punishment of his malignancy against his country; he has
12377,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"been cheated, neglected, and scorned. He is now in an obscurity"
12378,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,hardly penetrable; he is reduced to poverty and bursting with
12379,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"vexation” (may a restless spirit of innovation, springing from, and"
12380,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"nourished by, a bigotted vanity and a turbulent pride ever"
12381,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,experience a similar fate)! All this has had an effect; and I will
12382,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"state as a fact, which I call upon him to deny if he can, that he"
12383,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,has lately declared “that _Republican governments are the most
12384,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"arbitrary in the world_”! This MACHIAVEL had said before, and this"
12385,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,all unprejudiced men of reading and observation had long since
12386,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"admitted; but, we confess we little expected to hear DOCTOR"
12387,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"PRIESTLEY subscribe to the creed of the one, or to the"
12388,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"acknowledgments of the other. Adversity, however, is an able"
12389,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,advocate in the cause of TRUTH.

12391,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"The Address to the People of England, which is prefixed to the"
12392,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"publication, is short, but pointed and expressive. It breathes the"
12393,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"true spirit of a Briton. Of the literary merit of the work, after"
12394,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the ample analysis which we have given of its contents, and the"
12395,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"extracts which we have made, little remains to be said. We agree"
12396,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"with the publisher, who in the Advertisement says: “The author has"
12397,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,been more anxious to strengthen his arguments than to polish his
12398,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"style, to convince the judgment than to flatter the taste,” but"
12399,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,those critics must be more “_delicate_” or fastidious who can reject
12400,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,substantial advantages for fanciful defects. Though Peter aim not at
12401,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"embellishments, he possesses great strength and energy of language,"
12402,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,and generally writes with more accuracy than most of the American
12403,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"authors, who, be it observed, have a phraseology peculiar to"
12404,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"themselves. This tract contains much important information, and we"
12405,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,strenuously recommend it to the serious perusal of our countrymen;
12406,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,particularly to such of them as are disposed to question the
12407,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"superior advantages which they enjoy, over ALL republican states"
12408,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,under our own well-poised and limited MONARCHY. The following
12409,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"admonitions with which the author concludes, will, we trust, have a"
12410,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"due effect on the minds of those to whom they are addressed. “Such,"
12411,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"_Britons_, is the fruit of republican government _here_; not among"
12412,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"the apish and wolfish French, but among a people descended from the"
12413,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,same ancestors as yourselves. When your monarchial government bears
12414,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"such fruits, let it, I say, be hewn down and cast into the fire; but"
12415,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"till that disgraceful and dreadful day comes, watch over it with"
12416,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"care and defend it to the last drop of your blood, preserve it as"
12417,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"you would a golden casket, the apple of your eye, or the last dear"
12418,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"gift of your dying parents. With this I conclude, praying the God of"
12419,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"our fathers to lead you in the practice of all their virtues, to"
12420,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"give wisdom to your minds and strength to your arms, to keep you"
12421,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"firm and united, honest and generous, loyal, brave, and free; but"
12422,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,"above all, to preserve you from the desolating and degrading curse"
12423,MAGNA EST VERITAS ET PRÆVALEBIT.,of revolutionary madness and modern _republicanism_.”

15625,IN BARINEM.,"time of the Insurrection in the North, I had frequent and intimate"

15627,IN BARINEM.,often seen her riding on a black ram with a blue tail. Once I

15629,IN BARINEM.,"jelly. This jelly I tasted, and if it had been a little more acid, it"
15630,IN BARINEM.,would have been most excellent. The Noble Lords may laugh; but I declare
15631,IN BARINEM.,"the fact upon my veracity, which has never been doubted. Once I pursued"
15632,IN BARINEM.,this fiend into my ale cellar: she rode instantly out of my sight into
15633,IN BARINEM.,the bung-hole of a beer barrel. She was at that time mounted on her
15634,IN BARINEM.,"black ram with the blue tail. Some time after, my servants were much"
15635,IN BARINEM.,"surprised to find their ale full of _blue hairs_. I was not surprised,"
15636,IN BARINEM.,as I knew the blue _hairs_ were the hairs of the ram’s _blue tail_.
15637,IN BARINEM.,"Noble Lords may stare, but the fact is as I relate it. This _Moll"
15638,IN BARINEM.,Coggin_ was the fiend who raised the _Oak-boys_ to rebellion. I was also
15639,IN BARINEM.,well acquainted with the two Cow-boys mentioned by the Noble Lord; they
15640,IN BARINEM.,"were my tenants, and were certainly endowed with supernatural powers. I"
15641,IN BARINEM.,have known one of them tear up by the roots an Oak two hundred feet
15642,IN BARINEM.,"high, and bear it upright on his head four miles! his party were on that"
15643,IN BARINEM.,"account called Oak-boys. Noble Lords may laugh, but I speak from certain"
15644,IN BARINEM.,"knowledge. The Oak-tree grew in my garden, and I have often seen five"
15645,IN BARINEM.,hundred Swans perching on its boughs; these swans were remarkable for
15646,IN BARINEM.,destroying all the snipes in the country—they flew faster than any snipe
15647,IN BARINEM.,"I ever saw, and you may imagine a small bird could make but a feeble"

16416,DITHYRAMBUS.,"exciting mental exercise. I heard one or two of these lectures, and"
16417,DITHYRAMBUS.,thought very differently of him then from what I thought afterwards.
16418,DITHYRAMBUS.,"When, however, he found his popularity on the wane, and more stringent"
16419,DITHYRAMBUS.,"laws had been passed, to which he individually gave occasion, he came to"
16420,DITHYRAMBUS.,"the prudent resolution of abandoning his vagrant habits, and leading a"
16421,DITHYRAMBUS.,farmer’s life in a beautiful place near Brecon.... He was an amiable man
16422,DITHYRAMBUS.,"in private life, an affectionate husband, and a fond father. He"
16423,DITHYRAMBUS.,altogether mistook his talents—he told me without reserve that he
16424,DITHYRAMBUS.,believed he should establish his name among the epic poets of England;
16425,DITHYRAMBUS.,and it is a curious thing considering his own view’s that he thought the
16426,DITHYRAMBUS.,"establishment of Christianity, and the British Constitution, very"
16427,DITHYRAMBUS.,"appropriate subjects for his poem.... THELWALL, unlike Hardy, had the"
16428,DITHYRAMBUS.,"weakness of vanity; but he was a perfectly honest man, and had a power"
16429,DITHYRAMBUS.,of declamation which qualified him to be a mob orator. He used to say
16430,DITHYRAMBUS.,that if he were at the gallows with liberty to address the people for
16431,DITHYRAMBUS.,"half-an-hour, he should not fear the result; he was sure he could excite"
16432,DITHYRAMBUS.,"them to a rescue. I became acquainted with him soon after his acquittal,"
16433,DITHYRAMBUS.,"and never ceased to respect him for his sincerity, though I did not"

17344,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,profit. He paid particular attention to the medical use of the
17345,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"permanently Elastic Fluids, and avows that as “one rash experiment on a"
17346,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,patient would demolish a plan on which the hope of relieving mankind
17347,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"from much of their misery is founded,” he made preliminary experiments"
17348,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"on himself in the case of _Oxygene_ and _Consumption_, as alluded to in"
17349,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"the text, _À propos_ of the artificial distribution of disease, it may"
17350,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"be mentioned that in _The Batchelor_, p. 189, is a method for"
17351,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,“discharging the Plague”.
17352,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,
17353,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"He wrote much on the political topics of the day, always taking the"
17354,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"liberal side, and attacking PITT with great virulence and eloquence. The"
17355,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,principles of the French Revolution were at first advocated by him with
17356,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"the utmost enthusiasm, but he was soon disgusted by the excesses"
17357,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"committed. He was a student of German literature, and much admired by"
17358,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"Immanuel Kant. He was also an intimate friend of Darwin’s, whose"
17359,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"political opinions he shared, and whose works were intrusted to his"
17360,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,revision in manuscript. A few months after the publication of Darwin’s
17361,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"_Botanic Garden_, its magnificent imagery and harmonious versification"
17362,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,inspired some admirers to say that the style of this work was a style
17363,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"_sui generis_, and that it defied imitation. Dr. Beddoes maintained an"
17364,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"opposite opinion. Much as he admired the poem in question, he thought"
17365,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,that the Darwinian structure of verse might be imitated by a writer
17366,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"possessed of inferior poetical powers, and in a few days he produced in"
17367,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,the same circle part of the manuscript of _Alexander’s Expedition to the
17368,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,Indian Ocean_ as an unpublished work of the author of the _Botanic
17369,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"Garden_. The deception completely succeeded, and some enthusiastic"
17370,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,admirers of the latter work pointed out with triumph “certain passages
17371,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,as proofs of the position that the author in his happier efforts defied
17372,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"imitation”. Beddoes’s success was the more extraordinary, as in the"
17373,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,“Introduction” to a considerable extract from his poem which he printed
17374,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,"in the _Annual Anthology_ for 1796, he states that he had never before"
17375,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,written twice as many lines of verse as the composition under notice
17376,AD SIRMIONEM PENINSULAM.,consisted of.
