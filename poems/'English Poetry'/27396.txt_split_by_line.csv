31,PROUD SIGNILD.,
32,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Proud Signild's bold brothers have taken her hand,"
33,PROUD SIGNILD.,They've wedded her into a far distant land.
34,PROUD SIGNILD.,
35,PROUD SIGNILD.,"They've wedded her far from her own native land,"
36,PROUD SIGNILD.,To her father's foul murderer gave they her hand.
37,PROUD SIGNILD.,
38,PROUD SIGNILD.,"And so for eight winters the matter it stood,"
39,PROUD SIGNILD.,Their face for eight winters she never once view'd.
40,PROUD SIGNILD.,
41,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Proud Signild she brews, and the ruddy wine blends;"
42,PROUD SIGNILD.,To her brothers so courteous a bidding she sends.
43,PROUD SIGNILD.,
44,PROUD SIGNILD.,Sir Loumor then laughed to his heart's very core--
45,PROUD SIGNILD.,Not once had he laughed for eight winters before.
46,PROUD SIGNILD.,
47,PROUD SIGNILD.,"To the top of the castle proud Signild she goes,"
48,PROUD SIGNILD.,And thence she so many a wistful look throws.
49,PROUD SIGNILD.,
50,PROUD SIGNILD.,And now she perceives down the green hillock's side
51,PROUD SIGNILD.,Her seven bold brothers so furiously ride.
52,PROUD SIGNILD.,
53,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Proud Signild she stands on the castle's high peak,"
54,PROUD SIGNILD.,She hears in the courtyard her seven brothers speak.
55,PROUD SIGNILD.,
56,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Proud Signild she hastes her array to put on,"
57,PROUD SIGNILD.,And unto the hall to Sir Loumor she's gone.
58,PROUD SIGNILD.,
59,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Now hear thou, Sir Loumor, thou lord, great and fine,"
60,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Wilt welcome these seven bold brothers of mine?"""
61,PROUD SIGNILD.,
62,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""I'll welcome these seven bold brothers of thine,"
63,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Proud Signild, as if they were brothers of mine."""
64,PROUD SIGNILD.,
65,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor again a wild laughter outsent,"
66,PROUD SIGNILD.,And the hard marble wall by that laughter was rent.
67,PROUD SIGNILD.,
68,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Then outspake the child in the cradle that lay,"
69,PROUD SIGNILD.,No word had the child ever spoke till that day:
70,PROUD SIGNILD.,
71,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""It shows that no good is about to take place,"
72,PROUD SIGNILD.,"When my father he laughs in my dear mother's face."""
73,PROUD SIGNILD.,
74,PROUD SIGNILD.,With his foot he the cradle has spurned with such force
75,PROUD SIGNILD.,"That out rolled the baby, a blood-besprent corse."
76,PROUD SIGNILD.,
77,PROUD SIGNILD.,"So matters passed on 'till of evening the fall,"
78,PROUD SIGNILD.,To the evening repast the relations went all.
79,PROUD SIGNILD.,
80,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor her lord she placed at the board's head,"
81,PROUD SIGNILD.,To the stools at the bottom her brothers she led.
82,PROUD SIGNILD.,
83,PROUD SIGNILD.,"To Sir Loumor she handed the stout ruddy wine,"
84,PROUD SIGNILD.,To her brothers she only sweet milk will assign.
85,PROUD SIGNILD.,
86,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor pretended to drink deep and fast,"
87,PROUD SIGNILD.,But in secret the wine down beneath him he cast.
88,PROUD SIGNILD.,
89,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Proud Signild now to the bed chamber wends,"
90,PROUD SIGNILD.,And the bed she prepares for her dear-beloved friends.
91,PROUD SIGNILD.,
92,PROUD SIGNILD.,"The bed she outspreads on the hard rugged stone,"
93,PROUD SIGNILD.,And that to prevent them from sleeping was done.
94,PROUD SIGNILD.,
95,PROUD SIGNILD.,"And under their sides she placed slily their knives,"
96,PROUD SIGNILD.,Which well they might trust in defence of their lives.
97,PROUD SIGNILD.,
98,PROUD SIGNILD.,She also has placed underneath their bed heads
99,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Their actons of steel, and their keen naked blades."
100,PROUD SIGNILD.,
101,PROUD SIGNILD.,"'Twas late, late at night, and the lights were burnt low,"
102,PROUD SIGNILD.,And away to their couches it lists them to go.
103,PROUD SIGNILD.,
104,PROUD SIGNILD.,"No sooner proud Signild had sunk to repose,"
105,PROUD SIGNILD.,Than from her white side dread Sir Loumor arose.
106,PROUD SIGNILD.,
107,PROUD SIGNILD.,"To the hall, the dark hall, took Sir Loumor his way,"
108,PROUD SIGNILD.,Proud Signild's seven brothers intending to slay.
109,PROUD SIGNILD.,
110,PROUD SIGNILD.,"To the side of the bed upon tip toe he drew,"
111,PROUD SIGNILD.,And the seven bold brothers he traitorously slew.
112,PROUD SIGNILD.,
113,PROUD SIGNILD.,"In his fell hand uptakes he both faulchion and knife,"
114,PROUD SIGNILD.,And each of the sleepers deprived he of life.
115,PROUD SIGNILD.,
116,PROUD SIGNILD.,"In a bowl he collects of the murdered the gore,"
117,PROUD SIGNILD.,And that he brings in the proud Signild before.
118,PROUD SIGNILD.,
119,PROUD SIGNILD.,"In, in at the door-way Sir Loumor he sped,"
120,PROUD SIGNILD.,From Signild's cheek faded the beautiful red.
121,PROUD SIGNILD.,
122,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Sir Loumor, my lord, thy looks fill me with fright,"
123,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Say where hast thou been in the midst of the night?"""
124,PROUD SIGNILD.,
125,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""I've been to the hall, if the truth I must tell,"
126,PROUD SIGNILD.,"I heard my two hunting hawks screech there, and yell."""
127,PROUD SIGNILD.,
128,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""O why of thy hawks art thou talking, my lord?"
129,PROUD SIGNILD.,"May God in his mercy my dears brothers guard."""
130,PROUD SIGNILD.,
131,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor produced of her brothers the gore,"
132,PROUD SIGNILD.,And that by her foot he has placed on the floor.
133,PROUD SIGNILD.,
134,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Now drink thou, proud Signild, my much beloved Dame,"
135,PROUD SIGNILD.,"This blood from the veins of thy brothers that came."""
136,PROUD SIGNILD.,
137,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""With a terrible thirst I must needs be distrest,"
138,PROUD SIGNILD.,"When I, O Sir Loumor, obey thy behest."
139,PROUD SIGNILD.,
140,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""But to bed and to sleep, my dear lord, now repair,"
141,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Full little, be sure for my brothers I care."
142,PROUD SIGNILD.,
143,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""I care not although all my kindred are slain,"
144,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Since thee, my heart's dearest, alive I retain."""
145,PROUD SIGNILD.,
146,PROUD SIGNILD.,"So things in this fashion for eight winters stood,"
147,PROUD SIGNILD.,And Sir Loumor his brothers and sisters ne'er view'd.
148,PROUD SIGNILD.,
149,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor he brews, and the ruddy wine blends,"
150,PROUD SIGNILD.,To his brothers and sisters a bidding he sends.
151,PROUD SIGNILD.,
152,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Then laughed the proud Signild, that dame fair of face,"
153,PROUD SIGNILD.,And the first time it was for full eight winters space.
154,PROUD SIGNILD.,
155,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor's relations she placed at the board,"
156,PROUD SIGNILD.,And she handed them mead with so many a fair word.
157,PROUD SIGNILD.,
158,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Of the wine, the clear wine, drank Sir Loumor so free,"
159,PROUD SIGNILD.,For his life not the slightest precaution took he.
160,PROUD SIGNILD.,
161,PROUD SIGNILD.,"On the soft down she spread their beds high from the ground,"
162,PROUD SIGNILD.,She wished to procure for them slumbers so sound.
163,PROUD SIGNILD.,
164,PROUD SIGNILD.,"She spread out their beds on the bolsters of blue,"
165,PROUD SIGNILD.,Thereon with her fingers the sleep runes she drew.
166,PROUD SIGNILD.,
167,PROUD SIGNILD.,"No sooner Sir Loumor had sunk to repose,"
168,PROUD SIGNILD.,Than from his embrace the proud Signild arose.
169,PROUD SIGNILD.,
170,PROUD SIGNILD.,"From out of a corner she took a keen sword,"
171,PROUD SIGNILD.,She'll awake with its point the dear kin of her lord.
172,PROUD SIGNILD.,
173,PROUD SIGNILD.,"To the sleeping apartment proud Signild then sped,"
174,PROUD SIGNILD.,And straightway his five belov'd brothers slew dead.
175,PROUD SIGNILD.,
176,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Though her heart it was sad, and the tears in her eyes,"
177,PROUD SIGNILD.,His three belov'd sisters she slew in like guise.
178,PROUD SIGNILD.,
179,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Then swift in a bowl she collects the red gore,"
180,PROUD SIGNILD.,And that she brought in good Sir Loumor before.
181,PROUD SIGNILD.,
182,PROUD SIGNILD.,"She took off the chaplet her brow from around,"
183,PROUD SIGNILD.,And firmly the hands of Sir Loumor she bound.
184,PROUD SIGNILD.,
185,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Now wake thou, Sir Loumor, and speak to thy wife,"
186,PROUD SIGNILD.,"I'll not, whilst thou sleepest, deprive thee of life."
187,PROUD SIGNILD.,
188,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Now drink, O Sir Loumor, the kind and the good,"
189,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Drink, drink thy dear brothers' and sisters' heart's blood."""
190,PROUD SIGNILD.,
191,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""O sore would the thirst be, O Signild, full sore,"
192,PROUD SIGNILD.,That ever could tempt me to drink of that gore.
193,PROUD SIGNILD.,
194,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Thyself to thy bed, my sweet Signild, betake,"
195,PROUD SIGNILD.,"For the death of my kindred my heart will not break."""
196,PROUD SIGNILD.,
197,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Sir Loumor sought after his trusty brown brand,"
198,PROUD SIGNILD.,And found to his fear he was bound foot and hand.
199,PROUD SIGNILD.,
200,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""O Signild, proud Signild, I pray thee now spare,"
201,PROUD SIGNILD.,"And aye to be kind to thee, Signild, I swear."""
202,PROUD SIGNILD.,
203,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Methinks that thou didst little kindness display,"
204,PROUD SIGNILD.,The time thou my father didst murderously slay!
205,PROUD SIGNILD.,
206,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Thou slewest my father with treacherous glaive,"
207,PROUD SIGNILD.,"And then my dear brothers, so beauteous and brave."
208,PROUD SIGNILD.,
209,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Then hope not for mercy, on vengeance I'm bent,"
210,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Because all I cherished from me thou hast rent."""
211,PROUD SIGNILD.,
212,PROUD SIGNILD.,"Then she drew forth the knife from her sleeve bloody red,"
213,PROUD SIGNILD.,And Sir Loumor she stabbed till the life from him fled.
214,PROUD SIGNILD.,
215,PROUD SIGNILD.,Then out from its cradle the little child spake:
216,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""That deed, if I live, I will some day ywrake."""
217,PROUD SIGNILD.,
218,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""I know that thou art of the very same blood,"
219,PROUD SIGNILD.,"And I never expect thou to me wilt be good."""
220,PROUD SIGNILD.,
221,PROUD SIGNILD.,"The child by the small of the leg she has ta'en,"
222,PROUD SIGNILD.,And against the bed side she has beat out its brain.
223,PROUD SIGNILD.,
224,PROUD SIGNILD.,"""Now I, the proud Signild, have slain man for man,"
225,PROUD SIGNILD.,"And I'll hie me away to my land and my clan."""
226,PROUD SIGNILD.,

232,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
233,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"The Knight takes hawk, and the man takes hound,"
234,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,And away to the good green-wood they rambled;
235,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"There beasts both great and small they found,"
236,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Amid the forest glades that gambol'd.
237,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
238,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"A hind 'neath a linden tree he spied,"
239,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,A maid beneath the willows sitting;
240,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"The Knight outspread his mantle wide,"
241,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Within that spot for love so fitting.
242,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
243,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"And there throughout the night they lie,"
244,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,And no one sought their rest to trouble;
245,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,The linden tree so charmingly
246,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Conceals them with its foliage noble.
247,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
248,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"No sooner dawned the morning light,"
249,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"And early cocks commenced their crowing,"
250,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,The Damsel pats on his breast the knight:
251,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Sweet love, you must be up and going."
252,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
253,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Ride o'er the brig at full career,"
254,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,And o'er the verdant meadows hurry;
255,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"My brothers seven you'll meet I fear,"
256,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"So full of courage, strength, and fury."""
257,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
258,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""If seven or ten thy brothers be,"
259,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Each full of courage, strength, and beauty,"
260,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,If a comrade good they seek in me
261,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,I trust I know a comrade's duty.
262,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
263,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""And if me they'll have as a brother dear,"
264,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Their brother straight to be I'm willing;
265,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,But they shall win the victory ne'er
266,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"If bent my youthful blood on spilling."""
267,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
268,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""O dearest heart, with tears I pray"
269,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"That thou wilt not go lightly nigh them,"
270,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"But ride about another way,"
271,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Far distant off thou may'st descry them."""
272,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
273,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""O ne'er at court shall it be said"
274,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"That I, a knight, for warriors seven,"
275,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Or ten times seven, the straight road fled,"
276,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"To match them all I trust in heaven."""
277,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
278,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"His sword to his side the warrior tied,"
279,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"And then himself in his acton casing,"
280,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"A fond adieu to the Damsel cried,"
281,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Who sadly stood behind him gazing.
282,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
283,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,The youth despising all alarms
284,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"With spur so keen his courser urges,"
285,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Seven knights he meets in burnished arms
286,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,From out the wood as he emerges.
287,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
288,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Ha, early met, thou warrior good,"
289,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Pray tell us what thou hast been doing!"""
290,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""O I have been to the good green-wood,"
291,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"With hound and hawk the deer pursuing."""
292,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
293,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Where is thy hawk and greyhound, say?"
294,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Thy silvan spoil, we pray thee show it."""
295,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""A good friend came across my way,"

297,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
298,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""No knight will part with his prey so light"

300,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"With a maiden bright you slept last night,"
301,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Her brothers' leave nor sought nor granted."""
302,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
303,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""To chase the dun deer, Sirs, I rode,"
304,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Full little of your sister knowing,"
305,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,The first fair deer itself that showed
306,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,I chased with heart and bosom glowing.
307,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
308,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""It crouched beneath my scarlet cloak,"
309,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"It pleased me, Sirs, beyond all measure;"
310,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"With thanks to heaven the gift I took,"
311,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,And made me happy with my treasure.
312,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
313,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""I let my hounds the wild deer chase,"
314,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,I thought but little of their capture;
315,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"But I took the hind to my embrace,"
316,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,What moments then of bliss and rapture.
317,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
318,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Of all the world's fair maids was she"
319,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,The fairest both in face and carriage;
320,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"If she, Sir Knights, your sister be,"
321,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,I beg your sister's hand in marriage.
322,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
323,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""A faithful brother I will be,"
324,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,And in your cause I death will suffer;
325,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"And her I'll hold in respect and love,"
326,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"And nothing more a knight can proffer."""
327,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
328,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Thou shalt not get the maid for mate,"
329,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"But thou shalt die, thou knight enamour'd;"
330,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"So make thy shrift 'neath the linden straight,"
331,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,The little birds shall hear it stammer'd.
332,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
333,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""Now wilt thou stand, or wilt thou fly"
334,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,Into the deep wood for protection;
335,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Or guard thy young life valiantly,"
336,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"To prove thy courage and affection?"""
337,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
338,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"""O I will stand, nor craven fly"
339,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"Unto the murky wood for cover,"
340,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"I'll guard my life right valiantly,"
341,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"And thus I'll prove me worthy of her."""
342,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
343,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"First one he slew, then quickly two,"
344,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,His knightly courage well display'd he;
345,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"But, though his seven foes he slew,"
346,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,With his own life full dearly paid he.
347,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,
348,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,When the tidings reached the maiden's ear
349,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,She let fall briny tears in plenty;
350,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,"But if for her kin she shed one tear,"
351,THE DAMSEL OF THE WOOD,She shed I ween for the bold knight twenty.

359,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Knights Peter and Olaf they sat o'er the board,"
360,DAMSEL METTIE.,Betwixt them in jesting passed many a word.
361,DAMSEL METTIE.,
362,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Now hear thou, Sir Olaf my comrade, do tell"
363,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Why thou hast ne'er wedded some fair demoiselle?"""
364,DAMSEL METTIE.,
365,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""What need with a housewife myself to distress,"
366,DAMSEL METTIE.,So long as my little gold horn I possess?
367,DAMSEL METTIE.,
368,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""So long as my little gold horn I possess,"
369,DAMSEL METTIE.,I lure every maid I may wish to caress.
370,DAMSEL METTIE.,
371,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""The Damsel is not in the world to be found,"
372,DAMSEL METTIE.,"But what I can lure with that little horn's sound."""
373,DAMSEL METTIE.,
374,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""I know a proud damsel that dwells by the rill,"
375,DAMSEL METTIE.,On her thou couldst never accomplish thy will.
376,DAMSEL METTIE.,
377,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""I'll gage my war courser, the steady and tried,"
378,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Thou never canst lure the fair Mettie, my bride."""
379,DAMSEL METTIE.,
380,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Against him I'll gage my grey courser of power,"
381,DAMSEL METTIE.,That she shall this evening repair to my bower.
382,DAMSEL METTIE.,
383,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""My courser so proud, and my neck bone so white"
384,DAMSEL METTIE.,"I'll gage that I lure the fair Mettie this night."""
385,DAMSEL METTIE.,
386,DAMSEL METTIE.,"'Twas late in the evening, mist fell from the skies,"
387,DAMSEL METTIE.,Sir Olaf he plays in his very best guise.
388,DAMSEL METTIE.,
389,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Sir Olaf he plays on his gold harp a strain,"
390,DAMSEL METTIE.,That heard the proud Mettie far over the plain.
391,DAMSEL METTIE.,
392,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Sir Olaf a tune on his golden horn blew,"
393,DAMSEL METTIE.,To the house of fair Mettie the thrilling sounds flew.
394,DAMSEL METTIE.,
395,DAMSEL METTIE.,Long stood the fair Mettie and listened thereto:
396,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Now shall I or not to that horn-player go?"""
397,DAMSEL METTIE.,
398,DAMSEL METTIE.,Long stood damsel Mettie in doubt and in care:
399,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""No one of my maidens take with me I dare."""

403,DAMSEL METTIE.,
404,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Her mantle of blue the fair Mettie puts on,"
405,DAMSEL METTIE.,And unto the bower of Sir Olaf she's gone.
406,DAMSEL METTIE.,
407,DAMSEL METTIE.,On the door of the chamber she gave a low knock:
408,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Sir Olaf, I pray thee, arise and unlock."""
409,DAMSEL METTIE.,
410,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""O none have I summoned to me at this hour,"
411,DAMSEL METTIE.,"And unto no one will I open my door."""
412,DAMSEL METTIE.,
413,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Sir Olaf, arise, let me in I request,"
414,DAMSEL METTIE.,"At what I have heard I'm so sorely distrest."""
415,DAMSEL METTIE.,
416,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""At what thou hast heard, be thou glad or distrest,"
417,DAMSEL METTIE.,Thou comest not into my bower of rest.
418,DAMSEL METTIE.,
419,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""But soon should the door to thee open I wot,"
420,DAMSEL METTIE.,Provided Sir Peter thy sweetheart were not.
421,DAMSEL METTIE.,
422,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Although in my heart I may love thee full dear,"
423,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Sir Peter for me to admit thee's too near."""
424,DAMSEL METTIE.,
425,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Sir Olaf, arise, let me in I implore,"
426,DAMSEL METTIE.,"The night-dew falls chilly my scarlet dress o'er."""
427,DAMSEL METTIE.,
428,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Though chill fall the night-dew thy scarlet dress o'er,"
429,DAMSEL METTIE.,"I dare not, O Mettie, fling open my door."""
430,DAMSEL METTIE.,
431,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Since into thy bower thou lett'st me not come,"
432,DAMSEL METTIE.,"O let thy swains guide me, dear heart, to my home."""
433,DAMSEL METTIE.,
434,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""The night it is bright, and the moon sheds her ray,"
435,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Fair maid, thou wilt find without trouble thy way."
436,DAMSEL METTIE.,
437,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""The moon's in the sky, and shines clear o'er the mead,"
438,DAMSEL METTIE.,"So back by thyself to thy chamber proceed."""
439,DAMSEL METTIE.,
440,DAMSEL METTIE.,"The maid, and the little brown messan her friend,"
441,DAMSEL METTIE.,They home through the forest so lonely must wend.
442,DAMSEL METTIE.,
443,DAMSEL METTIE.,"And when to the gate of the castle she came,"
444,DAMSEL METTIE.,Sir Peter was leaning against it his frame.
445,DAMSEL METTIE.,
446,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Thrice welcome, thrice welcome, thou proud Mettelil,"
447,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Say where hast thou been in the night season still?"""
448,DAMSEL METTIE.,
449,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""I walked out, my lord, by no mortal eye seen,"
450,DAMSEL METTIE.,And I gathered the herbs both the blue and the green.
451,DAMSEL METTIE.,
452,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""The herbs I collected with diligent hand,"
453,DAMSEL METTIE.,Which just at this season in fullest bloom stand.
454,DAMSEL METTIE.,
455,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""I stood in the meadows throughout the long night,"
456,DAMSEL METTIE.,"And harked to the nightingale's song with delight."""
457,DAMSEL METTIE.,
458,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""No! not to the song from the nightingale's throat,"
459,DAMSEL METTIE.,But unto Sir Olaf his gilded horn's note.
460,DAMSEL METTIE.,
461,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""This night's walk, and others of similar sort,"
462,DAMSEL METTIE.,Will make thee the subject of common report.
463,DAMSEL METTIE.,
464,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""The walk of this night, and perhaps many more,"
465,DAMSEL METTIE.,"By the Saints, my fair Mettie, this walking give o'er."
466,DAMSEL METTIE.,
467,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Now hear thou proud Mettie, to bed hie away,"
468,DAMSEL METTIE.,And 'neath the white linen thy fair body lay.
469,DAMSEL METTIE.,
470,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""Depart to thy bed, that I rede thee to do,"
471,DAMSEL METTIE.,Would'st have me remain to thee tender and true.
472,DAMSEL METTIE.,
473,DAMSEL METTIE.,"""I've lost now my courser, the steady and tried,"
474,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Because thou hast proved thee a false, fickle bride."""
475,DAMSEL METTIE.,
476,DAMSEL METTIE.,"And what became of her no man ever knew,"
477,DAMSEL METTIE.,Nor whither her ashes before the wind flew.
478,DAMSEL METTIE.,
479,DAMSEL METTIE.,But as soon as her bower in ruddy flame blazed
480,DAMSEL METTIE.,In the breast of Sir Peter such anguish was raised.
481,DAMSEL METTIE.,
482,DAMSEL METTIE.,"Sir Peter he grieved to his very death day,"
483,DAMSEL METTIE.,Sir Olaf ne'er ventured to cross his friend's way.
484,DAMSEL METTIE.,
485,DAMSEL METTIE.,"I counsel each swain, in affectionate part,"
486,DAMSEL METTIE.,To tempt not too hardly the maid of his heart.
