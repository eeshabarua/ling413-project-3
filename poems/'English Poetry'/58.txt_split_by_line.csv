22,THE FIRST BOOK,
23,THE FIRST BOOK,
24,THE FIRST BOOK,"I, who erewhile the happy Garden sung"
25,THE FIRST BOOK,"By one man’s disobedience lost, now sing"
26,THE FIRST BOOK,"Recovered Paradise to all mankind,"
27,THE FIRST BOOK,By one man’s firm obedience fully tried
28,THE FIRST BOOK,"Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled"
29,THE FIRST BOOK,"In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,"
30,THE FIRST BOOK,And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.
31,THE FIRST BOOK,"Thou Spirit, who led’st this glorious Eremite"
32,THE FIRST BOOK,"Into the desert, his victorious field"
33,THE FIRST BOOK,"Against the spiritual foe, and brought’st him thence     10"
34,THE FIRST BOOK,"By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,"
35,THE FIRST BOOK,"As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,"
36,THE FIRST BOOK,"And bear through highth or depth of Nature’s bounds,"
37,THE FIRST BOOK,"With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds"
38,THE FIRST BOOK,"Above heroic, though in secret done,"
39,THE FIRST BOOK,And unrecorded left through many an age:
40,THE FIRST BOOK,Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.
41,THE FIRST BOOK,"Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice"
42,THE FIRST BOOK,"More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried"
43,THE FIRST BOOK,"Repentance, and Heaven’s kingdom nigh at hand     20"
44,THE FIRST BOOK,To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked
45,THE FIRST BOOK,"With awe the regions round, and with them came"
46,THE FIRST BOOK,From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed
47,THE FIRST BOOK,"To the flood Jordan—came as then obscure,"
48,THE FIRST BOOK,"Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon"
49,THE FIRST BOOK,"Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore"
50,THE FIRST BOOK,"As to his worthier, and would have resigned"
51,THE FIRST BOOK,To him his heavenly office. Nor was long
52,THE FIRST BOOK,His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized
53,THE FIRST BOOK,"Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove     30"
54,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Spirit descended, while the Father’s voice"
55,THE FIRST BOOK,From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.
56,THE FIRST BOOK,"That heard the Adversary, who, roving still"
57,THE FIRST BOOK,"About the world, at that assembly famed"
58,THE FIRST BOOK,"Would not be last, and, with the voice divine"
59,THE FIRST BOOK,"Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom"
60,THE FIRST BOOK,Such high attest was given a while surveyed
61,THE FIRST BOOK,"With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,"
62,THE FIRST BOOK,"Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air"
63,THE FIRST BOOK,"To council summons all his mighty Peers,     40"
64,THE FIRST BOOK,"Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,"
65,THE FIRST BOOK,"A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,"
66,THE FIRST BOOK,"With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:—"
67,THE FIRST BOOK,“O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World
68,THE FIRST BOOK,"(For much more willingly I mention Air,"
69,THE FIRST BOOK,"This our old conquest, than remember Hell,"
70,THE FIRST BOOK,"Our hated habitation), well ye know"
71,THE FIRST BOOK,"How many ages, as the years of men,"
72,THE FIRST BOOK,"This Universe we have possessed, and ruled"
73,THE FIRST BOOK,"In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,     50"
74,THE FIRST BOOK,Since Adam and his facile consort Eve
75,THE FIRST BOOK,"Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since"
76,THE FIRST BOOK,With dread attending when that fatal wound
77,THE FIRST BOOK,Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve
78,THE FIRST BOOK,Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven
79,THE FIRST BOOK,"Delay, for longest time to Him is short;"
80,THE FIRST BOOK,"And now, too soon for us, the circling hours"
81,THE FIRST BOOK,"This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we"
82,THE FIRST BOOK,Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound
83,THE FIRST BOOK,"(At least, if so we can, and by the head     60"
84,THE FIRST BOOK,Broken be not intended all our power
85,THE FIRST BOOK,"To be infringed, our freedom and our being"
86,THE FIRST BOOK,In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)—
87,THE FIRST BOOK,"For this ill news I bring: The Woman’s Seed,"
88,THE FIRST BOOK,"Destined to this, is late of woman born."
89,THE FIRST BOOK,His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;
90,THE FIRST BOOK,"But his growth now to youth’s full flower, displaying"
91,THE FIRST BOOK,"All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve"
92,THE FIRST BOOK,"Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear."
93,THE FIRST BOOK,"Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim     70"
94,THE FIRST BOOK,"His coming, is sent harbinger, who all"
95,THE FIRST BOOK,"Invites, and in the consecrated stream"
96,THE FIRST BOOK,"Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so"
97,THE FIRST BOOK,"Purified to receive him pure, or rather"
98,THE FIRST BOOK,"To do him honour as their King. All come,"
99,THE FIRST BOOK,And he himself among them was baptized—
100,THE FIRST BOOK,"Not thence to be more pure, but to receive"
101,THE FIRST BOOK,"The testimony of Heaven, that who he is"
102,THE FIRST BOOK,Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw
103,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising     80"
104,THE FIRST BOOK,"Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds"
105,THE FIRST BOOK,Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head
106,THE FIRST BOOK,A perfet Dove descend (whate’er it meant);
107,THE FIRST BOOK,"And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,"
108,THE FIRST BOOK,"‘This is my Son beloved,—in him am pleased.’"
109,THE FIRST BOOK,"His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire"
110,THE FIRST BOOK,He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;
111,THE FIRST BOOK,And what will He not do to advance his Son?
112,THE FIRST BOOK,"His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,"
113,THE FIRST BOOK,When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;     90
114,THE FIRST BOOK,"Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems"
115,THE FIRST BOOK,"In all his lineaments, though in his face"
116,THE FIRST BOOK,The glimpses of his Father’s glory shine.
117,THE FIRST BOOK,Ye see our danger on the utmost edge
118,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of hazard, which admits no long debate,"
119,THE FIRST BOOK,But must with something sudden be opposed
120,THE FIRST BOOK,"(Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),"
121,THE FIRST BOOK,"Ere in the head of nations he appear,"
122,THE FIRST BOOK,"Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth."
123,THE FIRST BOOK,"I, when no other durst, sole undertook     100"
124,THE FIRST BOOK,The dismal expedition to find out
125,THE FIRST BOOK,"And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed"
126,THE FIRST BOOK,Successfully: a calmer voyage now
127,THE FIRST BOOK,Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once
128,THE FIRST BOOK,Induces best to hope of like success.”
129,THE FIRST BOOK,"He ended, and his words impression left"
130,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of much amazement to the infernal crew,"
131,THE FIRST BOOK,Distracted and surprised with deep dismay
132,THE FIRST BOOK,At these sad tidings. But no time was then
133,THE FIRST BOOK,For long indulgence to their fears or grief:     110
134,THE FIRST BOOK,Unanimous they all commit the care
135,THE FIRST BOOK,And management of this man enterprise
136,THE FIRST BOOK,"To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt"
137,THE FIRST BOOK,At first against mankind so well had thrived
138,THE FIRST BOOK,"In Adam’s overthrow, and led their march"
139,THE FIRST BOOK,"From Hell’s deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,"
140,THE FIRST BOOK,"Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,"
141,THE FIRST BOOK,Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.
142,THE FIRST BOOK,So to the coast of Jordan he directs
143,THE FIRST BOOK,"His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,     120"
144,THE FIRST BOOK,"Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,"
145,THE FIRST BOOK,"This man of men, attested Son of God,"
146,THE FIRST BOOK,Temptation and all guile on him to try—
147,THE FIRST BOOK,So to subvert whom he suspected raised
148,THE FIRST BOOK,To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:
149,THE FIRST BOOK,"But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled"
150,THE FIRST BOOK,"The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,"
151,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright"
152,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:—"
153,THE FIRST BOOK,"“Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,     130"
154,THE FIRST BOOK,Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth
155,THE FIRST BOOK,"With Man or men’s affairs, how I begin"
156,THE FIRST BOOK,"To verify that solemn message late,"
157,THE FIRST BOOK,On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure
158,THE FIRST BOOK,"In Galilee, that she should bear a son,"
159,THE FIRST BOOK,"Great in renown, and called the Son of God."
160,THE FIRST BOOK,"Then told’st her, doubting how these things could be"
161,THE FIRST BOOK,"To her a virgin, that on her should come"
162,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest"
163,THE FIRST BOOK,"O’ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown,     140"
164,THE FIRST BOOK,To shew him worthy of his birth divine
165,THE FIRST BOOK,"And high prediction, henceforth I expose"
166,THE FIRST BOOK,"To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay"
167,THE FIRST BOOK,"His utmost subtlety, because he boasts"
168,THE FIRST BOOK,And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng
169,THE FIRST BOOK,Of his Apostasy. He might have learnt
170,THE FIRST BOOK,"Less overweening, since he failed in Job,"
171,THE FIRST BOOK,Whose constant perseverance overcame
172,THE FIRST BOOK,Whate’er his cruel malice could invent.
173,THE FIRST BOOK,"He now shall know I can produce a man,     150"
174,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of female seed, far abler to resist"
175,THE FIRST BOOK,"All his solicitations, and at length"
176,THE FIRST BOOK,"All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell—"
177,THE FIRST BOOK,Winning by conquest what the first man lost
178,THE FIRST BOOK,By fallacy surprised. But first I mean
179,THE FIRST BOOK,To exercise him in the Wilderness;
180,THE FIRST BOOK,There he shall first lay down the rudiments
181,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth"
182,THE FIRST BOOK,"To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes."
183,THE FIRST BOOK,By humiliation and strong sufferance     160
184,THE FIRST BOOK,"His weakness shall o’ercome Satanic strength,"
185,THE FIRST BOOK,"And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;"
186,THE FIRST BOOK,That all the Angels and aethereal Powers—
187,THE FIRST BOOK,"They now, and men hereafter—may discern"
188,THE FIRST BOOK,From what consummate virtue I have chose
189,THE FIRST BOOK,"This perfet man, by merit called my Son,"
190,THE FIRST BOOK,To earn salvation for the sons of men.”
191,THE FIRST BOOK,"So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven"
192,THE FIRST BOOK,Admiring stood a space; then into hymns
193,THE FIRST BOOK,"Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,     170"
194,THE FIRST BOOK,"Circling the throne and singing, while the hand"
195,THE FIRST BOOK,"Sung with the voice, and this the argument:—"
196,THE FIRST BOOK,"“Victory and triumph to the Son of God,"
197,THE FIRST BOOK,"Now entering his great duel, not of arms,"
198,THE FIRST BOOK,But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!
199,THE FIRST BOOK,The Father knows the Son; therefore secure
200,THE FIRST BOOK,"Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,"
201,THE FIRST BOOK,"Against whate’er may tempt, whate’er seduce,"
202,THE FIRST BOOK,"Allure, or terrify, or undermine."
203,THE FIRST BOOK,"Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,     180"
204,THE FIRST BOOK,"And, devilish machinations, come to nought!”"
205,THE FIRST BOOK,So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.
206,THE FIRST BOOK,"Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days"
207,THE FIRST BOOK,"Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,"
208,THE FIRST BOOK,Musing and much revolving in his breast
209,THE FIRST BOOK,How best the mighty work he might begin
210,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first"
211,THE FIRST BOOK,"Publish his godlike office now mature,"
212,THE FIRST BOOK,"One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading"
213,THE FIRST BOOK,"And his deep thoughts, the better to converse     190"
214,THE FIRST BOOK,"With solitude, till, far from track of men,"
215,THE FIRST BOOK,"Thought following thought, and step by step led on,"
216,THE FIRST BOOK,"He entered now the bordering Desert wild,"
217,THE FIRST BOOK,"And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,"
218,THE FIRST BOOK,His holy meditations thus pursued:—
219,THE FIRST BOOK,“O what a multitude of thoughts at once
220,THE FIRST BOOK,"Awakened in me swarm, while I consider"
221,THE FIRST BOOK,"What from within I feel myself, and hear"
222,THE FIRST BOOK,"What from without comes often to my ears,"
223,THE FIRST BOOK,Ill sorting with my present state compared!     200
224,THE FIRST BOOK,"When I was yet a child, no childish play"
225,THE FIRST BOOK,To me was pleasing; all my mind was set
226,THE FIRST BOOK,"Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,"
227,THE FIRST BOOK,What might be public good; myself I thought
228,THE FIRST BOOK,"Born to that end, born to promote all truth,"
229,THE FIRST BOOK,"All righteous things. Therefore, above my years,"
230,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;"
231,THE FIRST BOOK,"Made it my whole delight, and in it grew"
232,THE FIRST BOOK,"To such perfection that, ere yet my age"
233,THE FIRST BOOK,"Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast     210"
234,THE FIRST BOOK,"I went into the Temple, there to hear"
235,THE FIRST BOOK,"The teachers of our Law, and to propose"
236,THE FIRST BOOK,"What might improve my knowledge or their own,"
237,THE FIRST BOOK,And was admired by all. Yet this not all
238,THE FIRST BOOK,To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds
239,THE FIRST BOOK,"Flamed in my heart, heroic acts—one while"
240,THE FIRST BOOK,To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;
241,THE FIRST BOOK,"Then to subdue and quell, o’er all the earth,"
242,THE FIRST BOOK,"Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,"
243,THE FIRST BOOK,"Till truth were freed, and equity restored:     220"
244,THE FIRST BOOK,"Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first"
245,THE FIRST BOOK,"By winning words to conquer willing hearts,"
246,THE FIRST BOOK,And make persuasion do the work of fear;
247,THE FIRST BOOK,"At least to try, and teach the erring soul,"
248,THE FIRST BOOK,"Not wilfully misdoing, but unware"
249,THE FIRST BOOK,Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.
250,THE FIRST BOOK,"These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,"
251,THE FIRST BOOK,"By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,"
252,THE FIRST BOOK,"And said to me apart, ‘High are thy thoughts,"
253,THE FIRST BOOK,"O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar     230"
254,THE FIRST BOOK,To what highth sacred virtue and true worth
255,THE FIRST BOOK,"Can raise them, though above example high;"
256,THE FIRST BOOK,By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.
257,THE FIRST BOOK,"For know, thou art no son of mortal man;"
258,THE FIRST BOOK,"Though men esteem thee low of parentage,"
259,THE FIRST BOOK,Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules
260,THE FIRST BOOK,"All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men."
261,THE FIRST BOOK,A messenger from God foretold thy birth
262,THE FIRST BOOK,Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold
263,THE FIRST BOOK,"Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David’s throne,     240"
264,THE FIRST BOOK,And of thy kingdom there should be no end.
265,THE FIRST BOOK,At thy nativity a glorious quire
266,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung"
267,THE FIRST BOOK,"To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,"
268,THE FIRST BOOK,"And told them the Messiah now was born,"
269,THE FIRST BOOK,"Where they might see him; and to thee they came,"
270,THE FIRST BOOK,Directed to the manger where thou lay’st;
271,THE FIRST BOOK,For in the inn was left no better room.
272,THE FIRST BOOK,"A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,"
273,THE FIRST BOOK,"Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,     250"
274,THE FIRST BOOK,"To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;"
275,THE FIRST BOOK,"By whose bright course led on they found the place,"
276,THE FIRST BOOK,"Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,"
277,THE FIRST BOOK,By which they knew thee King of Israel born.
278,THE FIRST BOOK,"Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned"
279,THE FIRST BOOK,"By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,"
280,THE FIRST BOOK,"Before the altar and the vested priest,"
281,THE FIRST BOOK,Like things of thee to all that present stood.’
282,THE FIRST BOOK,"This having heart, straight I again revolved"
283,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ     260"
284,THE FIRST BOOK,"Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes"
285,THE FIRST BOOK,"Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake"
286,THE FIRST BOOK,"I am—this chiefly, that my way must lie"
287,THE FIRST BOOK,"Through many a hard assay, even to the death,"
288,THE FIRST BOOK,"Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,"
289,THE FIRST BOOK,"Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins’"
290,THE FIRST BOOK,Full weight must be transferred upon my head.
291,THE FIRST BOOK,"Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,"
292,THE FIRST BOOK,The time prefixed I waited; when behold
293,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,     270"
294,THE FIRST BOOK,"Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come"
295,THE FIRST BOOK,"Before Messiah, and his way prepare!"
296,THE FIRST BOOK,"I, as all others, to his baptism came,"
297,THE FIRST BOOK,Which I believed was from above; but he
298,THE FIRST BOOK,"Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed"
299,THE FIRST BOOK,Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)—
300,THE FIRST BOOK,Me him whose harbinger he was; and first
301,THE FIRST BOOK,"Refused on me his baptism to confer,"
302,THE FIRST BOOK,"As much his greater, and was hardly won."
303,THE FIRST BOOK,"But, as I rose out of the laving stream,     280"
304,THE FIRST BOOK,"Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence"
305,THE FIRST BOOK,The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;
306,THE FIRST BOOK,"And last, the sum of all, my Father’s voice,"
307,THE FIRST BOOK,"Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,"
308,THE FIRST BOOK,"Me his beloved Son, in whom alone"
309,THE FIRST BOOK,He was well pleased: by which I knew the time
310,THE FIRST BOOK,"Now full, that I no more should live obscure,"
311,THE FIRST BOOK,"But openly begin, as best becomes"
312,THE FIRST BOOK,The authority which I derived from Heaven.
313,THE FIRST BOOK,And now by some strong motion I am led     290
314,THE FIRST BOOK,Into this wilderness; to what intent
315,THE FIRST BOOK,I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know;
316,THE FIRST BOOK,For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.”
317,THE FIRST BOOK,"So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,"
318,THE FIRST BOOK,"And, looking round, on every side beheld"
319,THE FIRST BOOK,"A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades."
320,THE FIRST BOOK,"The way he came, not having marked return,"
321,THE FIRST BOOK,"Was difficult, by human steps untrod;"
322,THE FIRST BOOK,"And he still on was led, but with such thoughts"
323,THE FIRST BOOK,Accompanied of things past and to come     300
324,THE FIRST BOOK,Lodged in his breast as well might recommend
325,THE FIRST BOOK,Such solitude before choicest society.
326,THE FIRST BOOK,Full forty days he passed—whether on hill
327,THE FIRST BOOK,"Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night"
328,THE FIRST BOOK,Under the covert of some ancient oak
329,THE FIRST BOOK,"Or cedar to defend him from the dew,"
330,THE FIRST BOOK,"Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;"
331,THE FIRST BOOK,"Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,"
332,THE FIRST BOOK,Till those days ended; hungered then at last
333,THE FIRST BOOK,"Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild,     310"
334,THE FIRST BOOK,Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk
335,THE FIRST BOOK,The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;
336,THE FIRST BOOK,The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.
337,THE FIRST BOOK,"But now an aged man in rural weeds,"
338,THE FIRST BOOK,"Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,"
339,THE FIRST BOOK,"Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve"
340,THE FIRST BOOK,"Against a winter’s day, when winds blow keen,"
341,THE FIRST BOOK,"To warm him wet returned from field at eve,"
342,THE FIRST BOOK,He saw approach; who first with curious eye
343,THE FIRST BOOK,"Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:—     320"
344,THE FIRST BOOK,"“Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,"
345,THE FIRST BOOK,"So far from path or road of men, who pass"
346,THE FIRST BOOK,In troop or caravan? for single none
347,THE FIRST BOOK,"Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here"
348,THE FIRST BOOK,"His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth."
349,THE FIRST BOOK,"I ask the rather, and the more admire,"
350,THE FIRST BOOK,For that to me thou seem’st the man whom late
351,THE FIRST BOOK,Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford
352,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son"
353,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes     330"
354,THE FIRST BOOK,"Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth"
355,THE FIRST BOOK,"To town or village nigh (nighest is far),"
356,THE FIRST BOOK,"Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,"
357,THE FIRST BOOK,What happens new; fame also finds us out.”
358,THE FIRST BOOK,To whom the Son of God:—“Who brought me hither
359,THE FIRST BOOK,Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek.”
360,THE FIRST BOOK,"“By miracle he may,” replied the swain;"
361,THE FIRST BOOK,“What other way I see not; for we here
362,THE FIRST BOOK,"Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured"
363,THE FIRST BOOK,"More than the camel, and to drink go far—     340"
364,THE FIRST BOOK,Men to much misery and hardship born.
365,THE FIRST BOOK,"But, if thou be the Son of God, command"
366,THE FIRST BOOK,That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;
367,THE FIRST BOOK,"So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve"
368,THE FIRST BOOK,"With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.”"
369,THE FIRST BOOK,"He ended, and the Son of God replied:—"
370,THE FIRST BOOK,“Think’st thou such force in bread? Is it not written
371,THE FIRST BOOK,"(For I discern thee other than thou seem’st),"
372,THE FIRST BOOK,"Man lives not by bread only, but each word"
373,THE FIRST BOOK,"Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed     350"
374,THE FIRST BOOK,Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount
375,THE FIRST BOOK,"Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;"
376,THE FIRST BOOK,And forty days Eliah without food
377,THE FIRST BOOK,Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.
378,THE FIRST BOOK,"Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust"
379,THE FIRST BOOK,"Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?”"
380,THE FIRST BOOK,"Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:—"
381,THE FIRST BOOK,"“’Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate"
382,THE FIRST BOOK,"Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,"
383,THE FIRST BOOK,"Kept not my happy station, but was driven     360"
384,THE FIRST BOOK,With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep—
385,THE FIRST BOOK,Yet to that hideous place not so confined
386,THE FIRST BOOK,"By rigour unconniving but that oft,"
387,THE FIRST BOOK,"Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy"
388,THE FIRST BOOK,"Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,"
389,THE FIRST BOOK,Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens
390,THE FIRST BOOK,Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.
391,THE FIRST BOOK,"I came, among the Sons of God, when he"
392,THE FIRST BOOK,"Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,"
393,THE FIRST BOOK,"To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;     370"
394,THE FIRST BOOK,"And, when to all his Angels he proposed"
395,THE FIRST BOOK,"To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,"
396,THE FIRST BOOK,"That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,"
397,THE FIRST BOOK,"I undertook that office, and the tongues"
398,THE FIRST BOOK,Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies
399,THE FIRST BOOK,"To his destruction, as I had in charge:"
400,THE FIRST BOOK,For what he bids I do. Though I have lost
401,THE FIRST BOOK,"Much lustre of my native brightness, lost"
402,THE FIRST BOOK,"To be beloved of God, I have not lost"
403,THE FIRST BOOK,"To love, at least contemplate and admire,     380"
404,THE FIRST BOOK,"What I see excellent in good, or fair,"
405,THE FIRST BOOK,Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.
406,THE FIRST BOOK,What can be then less in me than desire
407,THE FIRST BOOK,"To see thee and approach thee, whom I know"
408,THE FIRST BOOK,"Declared the Son of God, to hear attent"
409,THE FIRST BOOK,"Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?"
410,THE FIRST BOOK,Men generally think me much a foe
411,THE FIRST BOOK,To all mankind. Why should I? they to me
412,THE FIRST BOOK,Never did wrong or violence. By them
413,THE FIRST BOOK,I lost not what I lost; rather by them     390
414,THE FIRST BOOK,"I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell"
415,THE FIRST BOOK,"Copartner in these regions of the World,"
416,THE FIRST BOOK,"If not disposer—lend them oft my aid,"
417,THE FIRST BOOK,"Oft my advice by presages and signs,"
418,THE FIRST BOOK,"And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,"
419,THE FIRST BOOK,Whereby they may direct their future life.
420,THE FIRST BOOK,"Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain"
421,THE FIRST BOOK,Companions of my misery and woe!
422,THE FIRST BOOK,"At first it may be; but, long since with woe"
423,THE FIRST BOOK,"Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof     400"
424,THE FIRST BOOK,"That fellowship in pain divides not smart,"
425,THE FIRST BOOK,Nor lightens aught each man’s peculiar load;
426,THE FIRST BOOK,"Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined."
427,THE FIRST BOOK,"This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,"
428,THE FIRST BOOK,"Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more.”"
429,THE FIRST BOOK,To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:—
430,THE FIRST BOOK,"“Deservedly thou griev’st, composed of lies"
431,THE FIRST BOOK,"From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,"
432,THE FIRST BOOK,"Who boast’st release from Hell, and leave to come"
433,THE FIRST BOOK,"Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com’st, indeed,     410"
434,THE FIRST BOOK,As a poor miserable captive thrall
435,THE FIRST BOOK,Comes to the place where he before had sat
436,THE FIRST BOOK,"Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,"
437,THE FIRST BOOK,"Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,"
438,THE FIRST BOOK,"A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,"
439,THE FIRST BOOK,To all the host of Heaven. The happy place
440,THE FIRST BOOK,"Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy—"
441,THE FIRST BOOK,"Rather inflames thy torment, representing"
442,THE FIRST BOOK,"Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;"
443,THE FIRST BOOK,So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.     420
444,THE FIRST BOOK,But thou art serviceable to Heaven’s King!
445,THE FIRST BOOK,Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear
446,THE FIRST BOOK,"Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?"
447,THE FIRST BOOK,What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem
448,THE FIRST BOOK,"Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him"
449,THE FIRST BOOK,With all inflictions? but his patience won.
450,THE FIRST BOOK,"The other service was thy chosen task,"
451,THE FIRST BOOK,To be a liar in four hundred mouths;
452,THE FIRST BOOK,"For lying is thy sustenance, thy food."
453,THE FIRST BOOK,Yet thou pretend’st to truth! all oracles     430
454,THE FIRST BOOK,"By thee are given, and what confessed more true"
455,THE FIRST BOOK,"Among the nations? That hath been thy craft,"
456,THE FIRST BOOK,By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.
457,THE FIRST BOOK,"But what have been thy answers? what but dark,"
458,THE FIRST BOOK,"Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,"
459,THE FIRST BOOK,"Which they who asked have seldom understood,"
460,THE FIRST BOOK,"And, not well understood, as good not known?"
461,THE FIRST BOOK,"Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,"
462,THE FIRST BOOK,"Returned the wiser, or the more instruct"
463,THE FIRST BOOK,"To fly or follow what concerned him most,     440"
464,THE FIRST BOOK,And run not sooner to his fatal snare?
465,THE FIRST BOOK,For God hath justly given the nations up
466,THE FIRST BOOK,"To thy delusions; justly, since they fell"
467,THE FIRST BOOK,"Idolatrous. But, when his purpose is"
468,THE FIRST BOOK,"Among them to declare his providence,"
469,THE FIRST BOOK,"To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,"
470,THE FIRST BOOK,"But from him, or his Angels president"
471,THE FIRST BOOK,"In every province, who, themselves disdaining"
472,THE FIRST BOOK,"To approach thy temples, give thee in command"
473,THE FIRST BOOK,"What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say     450"
474,THE FIRST BOOK,"To thy adorers? Thou, with trembling fear,"
475,THE FIRST BOOK,"Or like a fawning parasite, obey’st;"
476,THE FIRST BOOK,Then to thyself ascrib’st the truth foretold.
477,THE FIRST BOOK,But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;
478,THE FIRST BOOK,No more shalt thou by oracling abuse
479,THE FIRST BOOK,"The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,"
480,THE FIRST BOOK,And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice
481,THE FIRST BOOK,Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere—
482,THE FIRST BOOK,"At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute."
483,THE FIRST BOOK,God hath now sent his living Oracle     460
484,THE FIRST BOOK,"Into the world to teach his final will,"
485,THE FIRST BOOK,And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell
486,THE FIRST BOOK,"In pious hearts, an inward oracle"
487,THE FIRST BOOK,To all truth requisite for men to know.”
488,THE FIRST BOOK,"So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,"
489,THE FIRST BOOK,"Though inly stung with anger and disdain,"
490,THE FIRST BOOK,"Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:—"
491,THE FIRST BOOK,"“Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,"
492,THE FIRST BOOK,"And urged me hard with doings which not will,"
493,THE FIRST BOOK,"But misery, hath wrested from me. Where     470"
494,THE FIRST BOOK,"Easily canst thou find one miserable,"
495,THE FIRST BOOK,"And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,"
496,THE FIRST BOOK,"If it may stand him more in stead to lie,"
497,THE FIRST BOOK,"Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?"
498,THE FIRST BOOK,But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;
499,THE FIRST BOOK,"From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure"
500,THE FIRST BOOK,"Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit."
501,THE FIRST BOOK,"Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,"
502,THE FIRST BOOK,"Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,"
503,THE FIRST BOOK,And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;     480
504,THE FIRST BOOK,"What wonder, then, if I delight to hear"
505,THE FIRST BOOK,Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire
506,THE FIRST BOOK,Virtue who follow not her lore. Permit me
507,THE FIRST BOOK,"To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),"
508,THE FIRST BOOK,"And talk at least, though I despair to attain."
509,THE FIRST BOOK,"Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,"
510,THE FIRST BOOK,Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest
511,THE FIRST BOOK,"To tread his sacred courts, and minister"
512,THE FIRST BOOK,"About his altar, handling holy things,"
513,THE FIRST BOOK,"Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice     490"
514,THE FIRST BOOK,"To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet"
515,THE FIRST BOOK,Inspired: disdain not such access to me.”
516,THE FIRST BOOK,"To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:—"
517,THE FIRST BOOK,"“Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,"
518,THE FIRST BOOK,"I bid not, or forbid. Do as thou find’st"
519,THE FIRST BOOK,Permission from above; thou canst not more.”
520,THE FIRST BOOK,"He added not; and Satan, bowling low"
521,THE FIRST BOOK,"His gray dissimulation, disappeared,"
522,THE FIRST BOOK,Into thin air diffused: for now began
523,THE FIRST BOOK,Night with her sullen wing to double-shade     500
524,THE FIRST BOOK,The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;
525,THE FIRST BOOK,And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.
526,THE FIRST BOOK,
527,THE FIRST BOOK,
528,THE FIRST BOOK,
529,THE FIRST BOOK,
530,THE SECOND BOOK,THE SECOND BOOK
531,THE SECOND BOOK,
532,THE SECOND BOOK,
533,THE SECOND BOOK,"Meanwhile the new-baptized, who yet remained"
534,THE SECOND BOOK,"At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen"
535,THE SECOND BOOK,Him whom they heard so late expressly called
536,THE SECOND BOOK,"Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared,"
537,THE SECOND BOOK,"And on that high authority had believed,"
538,THE SECOND BOOK,"And with him talked, and with him lodged—I mean"
539,THE SECOND BOOK,"Andrew and Simon, famous after known,"
540,THE SECOND BOOK,"With others, though in Holy Writ not named—"
541,THE SECOND BOOK,"Now missing him, their joy so lately found,"
542,THE SECOND BOOK,"So lately found and so abruptly gone,     10"
543,THE SECOND BOOK,"Began to doubt, and doubted many days,"
544,THE SECOND BOOK,"And, as the days increased, increased their doubt."
545,THE SECOND BOOK,"Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn,"
546,THE SECOND BOOK,"And for a time caught up to God, as once"
547,THE SECOND BOOK,"Moses was in the Mount and missing long,"
548,THE SECOND BOOK,"And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels"
549,THE SECOND BOOK,"Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come."
550,THE SECOND BOOK,"Therefore, as those young prophets then with care"
551,THE SECOND BOOK,"Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these"
552,THE SECOND BOOK,Nigh to Bethabara—in Jericho     20
553,THE SECOND BOOK,"The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old,"
554,THE SECOND BOOK,"Machaerus, and each town or city walled"
555,THE SECOND BOOK,"On this side the broad lake Genezaret,"
556,THE SECOND BOOK,Or in Peraea—but returned in vain.
557,THE SECOND BOOK,"Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek,"
558,THE SECOND BOOK,"Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play,"
559,THE SECOND BOOK,"Plain fishermen (no greater men them call),"
560,THE SECOND BOOK,"Close in a cottage low together got,"
561,THE SECOND BOOK,Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:—
562,THE SECOND BOOK,"“Alas, from what high hope to what relapse     30"
563,THE SECOND BOOK,Unlooked for are we fallen! Our eyes beheld
564,THE SECOND BOOK,"Messiah certainly now come, so long"
565,THE SECOND BOOK,Expected of our fathers; we have heard
566,THE SECOND BOOK,"His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth."
567,THE SECOND BOOK,"‘Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand;"
568,THE SECOND BOOK,The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:’
569,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned"
570,THE SECOND BOOK,Into perplexity and new amaze.
571,THE SECOND BOOK,For whither is he gone? what accident
572,THE SECOND BOOK,Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire     40
573,THE SECOND BOOK,"After appearance, and again prolong"
574,THE SECOND BOOK,"Our expectation? God of Israel,"
575,THE SECOND BOOK,Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.
576,THE SECOND BOOK,"Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress"
577,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust"
578,THE SECOND BOOK,"They have exalted, and behind them cast"
579,THE SECOND BOOK,"All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate"
580,THE SECOND BOOK,Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!
581,THE SECOND BOOK,But let us wait; thus far He hath performed—
582,THE SECOND BOOK,"Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him     50"
583,THE SECOND BOOK,By his great Prophet pointed at and shown
584,THE SECOND BOOK,"In public, and with him we have conversed."
585,THE SECOND BOOK,"Let us be glad of this, and all our fears"
586,THE SECOND BOOK,"Lay on his providence; He will not fail,"
587,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall—"
588,THE SECOND BOOK,"Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence:"
589,THE SECOND BOOK,"Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return.”"
590,THE SECOND BOOK,Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume
591,THE SECOND BOOK,To find whom at the first they found unsought.
592,THE SECOND BOOK,"But to his mother Mary, when she saw     60"
593,THE SECOND BOOK,"Others returned from baptism, not her Son,"
594,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none,"
595,THE SECOND BOOK,"Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure,"
596,THE SECOND BOOK,"Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised"
597,THE SECOND BOOK,"Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:—"
598,THE SECOND BOOK,"“Oh, what avails me now that honour high,"
599,THE SECOND BOOK,"To have conceived of God, or that salute,"
600,THE SECOND BOOK,"‘Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!’"
601,THE SECOND BOOK,"While I to sorrows am no less advanced,"
602,THE SECOND BOOK,And fears as eminent above the lot     70
603,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of other women, by the birth I bore:"
604,THE SECOND BOOK,"In such a season born, when scarce a shed"
605,THE SECOND BOOK,Could be obtained to shelter him or me
606,THE SECOND BOOK,"From the bleak air? A stable was our warmth,"
607,THE SECOND BOOK,A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly
608,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king"
609,THE SECOND BOOK,"Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled"
610,THE SECOND BOOK,With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.
611,THE SECOND BOOK,"From Egypt home returned, in Nazareth"
612,THE SECOND BOOK,Hath been our dwelling many years; his life     80
613,THE SECOND BOOK,"Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,"
614,THE SECOND BOOK,"Little suspicious to any king. But now,"
615,THE SECOND BOOK,"Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear,"
616,THE SECOND BOOK,"By John the Baptist, and in public shewn,"
617,THE SECOND BOOK,"Son owned from Heaven by his Father’s voice,"
618,THE SECOND BOOK,I looked for some great change. To honour? no;
619,THE SECOND BOOK,"But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold,"
620,THE SECOND BOOK,That to the fall and rising he should be
621,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of many in Israel, and to a sign"
622,THE SECOND BOOK,Spoken against—that through my very soul     90
623,THE SECOND BOOK,"A sword shall pierce. This is my favoured lot,"
624,THE SECOND BOOK,My exaltation to afflictions high!
625,THE SECOND BOOK,"Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!"
626,THE SECOND BOOK,"I will not argue that, nor will repine."
627,THE SECOND BOOK,But where delays he now? Some great intent
628,THE SECOND BOOK,"Conceals him. When twelve years he scarce had seen,"
629,THE SECOND BOOK,"I lost him, but so found as well I saw"
630,THE SECOND BOOK,"He could not lose himself, but went about"
631,THE SECOND BOOK,His Father’s business. What he meant I mused—
632,THE SECOND BOOK,Since understand; much more his absence now     100
633,THE SECOND BOOK,Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.
634,THE SECOND BOOK,But I to wait with patience am inured;
635,THE SECOND BOOK,My heart hath been a storehouse long of things
636,THE SECOND BOOK,"And sayings laid up, pretending strange events.”"
637,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind"
638,THE SECOND BOOK,Recalling what remarkably had passed
639,THE SECOND BOOK,"Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts"
640,THE SECOND BOOK,Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling:
641,THE SECOND BOOK,"The while her Son, tracing the desert wild,"
642,THE SECOND BOOK,"Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,     110"
643,THE SECOND BOOK,"Into himself descended, and at once"
644,THE SECOND BOOK,All his great work to come before him set—
645,THE SECOND BOOK,"How to begin, how to accomplish best"
646,THE SECOND BOOK,"His end of being on Earth, and mission high."
647,THE SECOND BOOK,"For Satan, with sly preface to return,"
648,THE SECOND BOOK,"Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone"
649,THE SECOND BOOK,"Up to the middle region of thick air,"
650,THE SECOND BOOK,Where all his Potentates in council sate.
651,THE SECOND BOOK,"There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy,"
652,THE SECOND BOOK,"Solicitous and blank, he thus began:—     120"
653,THE SECOND BOOK,"“Princes, Heaven’s ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones—"
654,THE SECOND BOOK,"Daemonian Spirits now, from the element"
655,THE SECOND BOOK,"Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called"
656,THE SECOND BOOK,"Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath"
657,THE SECOND BOOK,(So may we hold our place and these mild seats
658,THE SECOND BOOK,Without new trouble!)—such an enemy
659,THE SECOND BOOK,"Is risen to invade us, who no less"
660,THE SECOND BOOK,Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.
661,THE SECOND BOOK,"I, as I undertook, and with the vote"
662,THE SECOND BOOK,"Consenting in full frequence was impowered,     130"
663,THE SECOND BOOK,"Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find"
664,THE SECOND BOOK,Far other labour to be undergone
665,THE SECOND BOOK,"Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men,"
666,THE SECOND BOOK,"Though Adam by his wife’s allurement fell,"
667,THE SECOND BOOK,However to this Man inferior far—
668,THE SECOND BOOK,"If he be Man by mother’s side, at least"
669,THE SECOND BOOK,"With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned,"
670,THE SECOND BOOK,"Perfections absolute, graces divine,"
671,THE SECOND BOOK,And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.
672,THE SECOND BOOK,"Therefore I am returned, lest confidence     140"
673,THE SECOND BOOK,Of my success with Eve in Paradise
674,THE SECOND BOOK,Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure
675,THE SECOND BOOK,Of like succeeding here. I summon all
676,THE SECOND BOOK,Rather to be in readiness with hand
677,THE SECOND BOOK,"Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst"
678,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thought none my equal, now be overmatched.”"
679,THE SECOND BOOK,"So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all"
680,THE SECOND BOOK,With clamour was assured their utmost aid
681,THE SECOND BOOK,At his command; when from amidst them rose
682,THE SECOND BOOK,"Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,     150"
683,THE SECOND BOOK,"The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,"
684,THE SECOND BOOK,"The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:—"
685,THE SECOND BOOK,"“Set women in his eye and in his walk,"
686,THE SECOND BOOK,Among daughters of men the fairest found.
687,THE SECOND BOOK,Many are in each region passing fair
688,THE SECOND BOOK,"As the noon sky, more like to goddesses"
689,THE SECOND BOOK,"Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet,"
690,THE SECOND BOOK,"Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues"
691,THE SECOND BOOK,"Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild"
692,THE SECOND BOOK,"And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,     160"
693,THE SECOND BOOK,"Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw"
694,THE SECOND BOOK,Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.
695,THE SECOND BOOK,Such object hath the power to soften and tame
696,THE SECOND BOOK,"Severest temper, smooth the rugged’st brow,"
697,THE SECOND BOOK,"Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,"
698,THE SECOND BOOK,"Draw out with credulous desire, and lead"
699,THE SECOND BOOK,"At will the manliest, resolutest breast,"
700,THE SECOND BOOK,As the magnetic hardest iron draws.
701,THE SECOND BOOK,"Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart"
702,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,     170"
703,THE SECOND BOOK,"And made him bow, to the gods of his wives.”"
704,THE SECOND BOOK,To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:—
705,THE SECOND BOOK,"“Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh’st"
706,THE SECOND BOOK,All others by thyself. Because of old
707,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thou thyself doat’st on womankind, admiring"
708,THE SECOND BOOK,"Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace,"
709,THE SECOND BOOK,"None are, thou think’st, but taken with such toys."
710,THE SECOND BOOK,"Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew,"
711,THE SECOND BOOK,"False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth,"
712,THE SECOND BOOK,"Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,     180"
713,THE SECOND BOOK,"And coupled with them, and begot a race."
714,THE SECOND BOOK,"Have we not seen, or by relation heard,"
715,THE SECOND BOOK,"In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk’st,"
716,THE SECOND BOOK,"In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side,"
717,THE SECOND BOOK,"In valley or green meadow, to waylay"
718,THE SECOND BOOK,"Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene,"
719,THE SECOND BOOK,"Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa,"
720,THE SECOND BOOK,"Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more"
721,THE SECOND BOOK,"Too long—then lay’st thy scapes on names adored,"
722,THE SECOND BOOK,"Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,     190"
723,THE SECOND BOOK,"Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan? But these haunts"
724,THE SECOND BOOK,Delight not all. Among the sons of men
725,THE SECOND BOOK,How many have with a smile made small account
726,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned"
727,THE SECOND BOOK,"All her assaults, on worthier things intent!"
728,THE SECOND BOOK,"Remember that Pellean conqueror,"
729,THE SECOND BOOK,"A youth, how all the beauties of the East"
730,THE SECOND BOOK,"He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed;"
731,THE SECOND BOOK,"How he surnamed of Africa dismissed,"
732,THE SECOND BOOK,"In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.     200"
733,THE SECOND BOOK,"For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full"
734,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond"
735,THE SECOND BOOK,Higher design than to enjoy his state;
736,THE SECOND BOOK,Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.
737,THE SECOND BOOK,But he whom we attempt is wiser far
738,THE SECOND BOOK,"Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,"
739,THE SECOND BOOK,Made and set wholly on the accomplishment
740,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of greatest things. What woman will you find,"
741,THE SECOND BOOK,"Though of this age the wonder and the fame,"
742,THE SECOND BOOK,On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye     210
743,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of fond desire? Or should she, confident,"
744,THE SECOND BOOK,"As sitting queen adored on Beauty’s throne,"
745,THE SECOND BOOK,Descend with all her winning charms begirt
746,THE SECOND BOOK,"To enamour, as the zone of Venus once"
747,THE SECOND BOOK,"Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell),"
748,THE SECOND BOOK,"How would one look from his majestic brow,"
749,THE SECOND BOOK,"Seated as on the top of Virtue’s hill,"
750,THE SECOND BOOK,"Discountenance her despised, and put to rout"
751,THE SECOND BOOK,"All her array, her female pride deject,"
752,THE SECOND BOOK,Or turn to reverent awe! For Beauty stands     220
753,THE SECOND BOOK,In the admiration only of weak minds
754,THE SECOND BOOK,"Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes"
755,THE SECOND BOOK,"Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,"
756,THE SECOND BOOK,At every sudden slighting quite abashed.
757,THE SECOND BOOK,Therefore with manlier objects we must try
758,THE SECOND BOOK,His constancy—with such as have more shew
759,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise"
760,THE SECOND BOOK,(Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked);
761,THE SECOND BOOK,Or that which only seems to satisfy
762,THE SECOND BOOK,"Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.     230"
763,THE SECOND BOOK,"And now I know he hungers, where no food"
764,THE SECOND BOOK,"Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness:"
765,THE SECOND BOOK,The rest commit to me; I shall let pass
766,THE SECOND BOOK,"No advantage, and his strength as oft assay.”"
767,THE SECOND BOOK,"He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim;"
768,THE SECOND BOOK,Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band
769,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of Spirits likest to himself in guile,"
770,THE SECOND BOOK,"To be at hand and at his beck appear,"
771,THE SECOND BOOK,If cause were to unfold some active scene
772,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of various persons, each to know his part;     240"
773,THE SECOND BOOK,"Then to the desert takes with these his flight,"
774,THE SECOND BOOK,"Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God,"
775,THE SECOND BOOK,"After forty days’ fasting, had remained,"
776,THE SECOND BOOK,"Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:—"
777,THE SECOND BOOK,“Where will this end? Four times ten days I have passed
778,THE SECOND BOOK,"Wandering this woody maze, and human food"
779,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nor tasted, nor had appetite. That fast"
780,THE SECOND BOOK,"To virtue I impute not, or count part"
781,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of what I suffer here. If nature need not,"
782,THE SECOND BOOK,"Or God support nature without repast,     250"
783,THE SECOND BOOK,"Though needing, what praise is it to endure?"
784,THE SECOND BOOK,But now I feel I hunger; which declares
785,THE SECOND BOOK,Nature hath need of what she asks. Yet God
786,THE SECOND BOOK,"Can satisfy that need some other way,"
787,THE SECOND BOOK,Though hunger still remain. So it remain
788,THE SECOND BOOK,"Without this body’s wasting, I content me,"
789,THE SECOND BOOK,And from the sting of famine fear no harm;
790,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed"
791,THE SECOND BOOK,Me hungering more to do my Father’s will.”
792,THE SECOND BOOK,"It was the hour of night, when thus the Son     260"
793,THE SECOND BOOK,"Communed in silent walk, then laid him down"
794,THE SECOND BOOK,Under the hospitable covert nigh
795,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of trees thick interwoven. There he slept,"
796,THE SECOND BOOK,"And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream,"
797,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of meats and drinks, nature’s refreshment sweet."
798,THE SECOND BOOK,"Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood,"
799,THE SECOND BOOK,And saw the ravens with their horny beaks
800,THE SECOND BOOK,Food to Elijah bringing even and morn—
801,THE SECOND BOOK,"Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought;"
802,THE SECOND BOOK,"He saw the Prophet also, how he fled     270"
803,THE SECOND BOOK,"Into the desert, and how there he slept"
804,THE SECOND BOOK,"Under a juniper—then how, awaked,"
805,THE SECOND BOOK,"He found his supper on the coals prepared,"
806,THE SECOND BOOK,"And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,"
807,THE SECOND BOOK,"And eat the second time after repose,"
808,THE SECOND BOOK,The strength whereof sufficed him forty days:
809,THE SECOND BOOK,"Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,"
810,THE SECOND BOOK,Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.
811,THE SECOND BOOK,Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark
812,THE SECOND BOOK,"Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry     280"
813,THE SECOND BOOK,"The Morn’s approach, and greet her with his song."
814,THE SECOND BOOK,As lightly from his grassy couch up rose
815,THE SECOND BOOK,"Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;"
816,THE SECOND BOOK,"Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked."
817,THE SECOND BOOK,"Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,"
818,THE SECOND BOOK,"From whose high top to ken the prospect round,"
819,THE SECOND BOOK,"If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;"
820,THE SECOND BOOK,"But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw—"
821,THE SECOND BOOK,"Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,"
822,THE SECOND BOOK,With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.     290
823,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thither he bent his way, determined there"
824,THE SECOND BOOK,"To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade"
825,THE SECOND BOOK,"High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown,"
826,THE SECOND BOOK,That opened in the midst a woody scene;
827,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nature’s own work it seemed (Nature taught Art),"
828,THE SECOND BOOK,"And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt"
829,THE SECOND BOOK,Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs. He viewed it round;
830,THE SECOND BOOK,"When suddenly a man before him stood,"
831,THE SECOND BOOK,"Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,"
832,THE SECOND BOOK,"As one in city or court or palace bred,     300"
833,THE SECOND BOOK,And with fair speech these words to him addressed:—
834,THE SECOND BOOK,"“With granted leave officious I return,"
835,THE SECOND BOOK,But much more wonder that the Son of God
836,THE SECOND BOOK,"In this wild solitude so long should bide,"
837,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of all things destitute, and, well I know,"
838,THE SECOND BOOK,"Not without hunger. Others of some note,"
839,THE SECOND BOOK,"As story tells, have trod this wilderness:"
840,THE SECOND BOOK,"The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son,"
841,THE SECOND BOOK,"Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief"
842,THE SECOND BOOK,By a providing Angel; all the race     310
843,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of Israel here had famished, had not God"
844,THE SECOND BOOK,"Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold,"
845,THE SECOND BOOK,"Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed"
846,THE SECOND BOOK,Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.
847,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of thee those forty days none hath regard,"
848,THE SECOND BOOK,Forty and more deserted here indeed.”
849,THE SECOND BOOK,To whom thus Jesus:—“What conclud’st thou hence?
850,THE SECOND BOOK,"They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none.”"
851,THE SECOND BOOK,“How hast thou hunger then?” Satan replied.
852,THE SECOND BOOK,"“Tell me, if food were now before thee set,     320"
853,THE SECOND BOOK,Wouldst thou not eat?” “Thereafter as I like
854,THE SECOND BOOK,"the giver,” answered Jesus. “Why should that"
855,THE SECOND BOOK,Cause thy refusal?” said the subtle Fiend.
856,THE SECOND BOOK,“Hast thou not right to all created things?
857,THE SECOND BOOK,"Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee"
858,THE SECOND BOOK,"Duty and service, nor to stay till bid,"
859,THE SECOND BOOK,But tender all their power? Nor mention I
860,THE SECOND BOOK,"Meats by the law unclean, or offered first"
861,THE SECOND BOOK,To idols—those young Daniel could refuse;
862,THE SECOND BOOK,Nor proffered by an enemy—though who     330
863,THE SECOND BOOK,"Would scruple that, with want oppressed? Behold,"
864,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nature ashamed, or, better to express,"
865,THE SECOND BOOK,"Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed"
866,THE SECOND BOOK,"From all the elements her choicest store,"
867,THE SECOND BOOK,"To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord"
868,THE SECOND BOOK,With honour. Only deign to sit and eat.”
869,THE SECOND BOOK,"He spake no dream; for, as his words had end,"
870,THE SECOND BOOK,"Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld,"
871,THE SECOND BOOK,"In ample space under the broadest shade,"
872,THE SECOND BOOK,"A table richly spread in regal mode,     340"
873,THE SECOND BOOK,With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort
874,THE SECOND BOOK,"And savour—beasts of chase, or fowl of game,"
875,THE SECOND BOOK,"In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled,"
876,THE SECOND BOOK,"Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore,"
877,THE SECOND BOOK,"Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin,"
878,THE SECOND BOOK,"And exquisitest name, for which was drained"
879,THE SECOND BOOK,"Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast."
880,THE SECOND BOOK,"Alas! how simple, to these cates compared,"
881,THE SECOND BOOK,Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!
882,THE SECOND BOOK,"And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,     350"
883,THE SECOND BOOK,"That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood"
884,THE SECOND BOOK,"Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue"
885,THE SECOND BOOK,"Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more,"
886,THE SECOND BOOK,"Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood,"
887,THE SECOND BOOK,"Nymphs of Diana’s train, and Naiades"
888,THE SECOND BOOK,"With fruits and flowers from Amalthea’s horn,"
889,THE SECOND BOOK,"And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed"
890,THE SECOND BOOK,"Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since"
891,THE SECOND BOOK,Of faery damsels met in forest wide
892,THE SECOND BOOK,"By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,     360"
893,THE SECOND BOOK,"Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore."
894,THE SECOND BOOK,And all the while harmonious airs were heard
895,THE SECOND BOOK,Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds
896,THE SECOND BOOK,Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned
897,THE SECOND BOOK,"From their soft wings, and Flora’s earliest smells."
898,THE SECOND BOOK,Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now
899,THE SECOND BOOK,His invitation earnestly renewed:—
900,THE SECOND BOOK,“What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?
901,THE SECOND BOOK,These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict
902,THE SECOND BOOK,Defends the touching of these viands pure;     370
903,THE SECOND BOOK,"Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil,"
904,THE SECOND BOOK,"But life preserves, destroys life’s enemy,"
905,THE SECOND BOOK,"Hunger, with sweet restorative delight."
906,THE SECOND BOOK,"All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs,"
907,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay"
908,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord."
909,THE SECOND BOOK,"What doubt’st thou, Son of God? Sit down and eat.”"
910,THE SECOND BOOK,To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:—
911,THE SECOND BOOK,“Said’st thou not that to all things I had right?
912,THE SECOND BOOK,And who withholds my power that right to use?     380
913,THE SECOND BOOK,"Shall I receive by gift what of my own,"
914,THE SECOND BOOK,"When and where likes me best, I can command?"
915,THE SECOND BOOK,"I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,"
916,THE SECOND BOOK,"Command a table in this wilderness,"
917,THE SECOND BOOK,"And call swift flights of Angels ministrant,"
918,THE SECOND BOOK,"Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend:"
919,THE SECOND BOOK,"Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence"
920,THE SECOND BOOK,"In vain, where no acceptance it can find?"
921,THE SECOND BOOK,And with my hunger what hast thou to do?
922,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,     390"
923,THE SECOND BOOK,"And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles.”"
924,THE SECOND BOOK,"To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:—"
925,THE SECOND BOOK,“That I have also power to give thou seest;
926,THE SECOND BOOK,If of that power I bring thee voluntary
927,THE SECOND BOOK,"What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased,"
928,THE SECOND BOOK,And rather opportunely in this place
929,THE SECOND BOOK,"Chose to impart to thy apparent need,"
930,THE SECOND BOOK,Why shouldst thou not accept it? But I see
931,THE SECOND BOOK,What I can do or offer is suspect.
932,THE SECOND BOOK,"Of these things others quickly will dispose,     400"
933,THE SECOND BOOK,Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil.” With that
934,THE SECOND BOOK,"Both table and provision vanished quite,"
935,THE SECOND BOOK,With sound of harpies’ wings and talons heard;
936,THE SECOND BOOK,"Only the importune Tempter still remained,"
937,THE SECOND BOOK,And with these words his temptation pursued:—
938,THE SECOND BOOK,"“By hunger, that each other creature tames,"
939,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved;"
940,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thy temperance, invincible besides,"
941,THE SECOND BOOK,For no allurement yields to appetite;
942,THE SECOND BOOK,"And all thy heart is set on high designs,     410"
943,THE SECOND BOOK,High actions. But wherewith to be achieved?
944,THE SECOND BOOK,Great acts require great means of enterprise;
945,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth,"
946,THE SECOND BOOK,"A carpenter thy father known, thyself"
947,THE SECOND BOOK,"Bred up in poverty and straits at home,"
948,THE SECOND BOOK,Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit.
949,THE SECOND BOOK,"Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire"
950,THE SECOND BOOK,To greatness? whence authority deriv’st?
951,THE SECOND BOOK,"What followers, what retinue canst thou gain,"
952,THE SECOND BOOK,"Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude,     420"
953,THE SECOND BOOK,Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost?
954,THE SECOND BOOK,"Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms."
955,THE SECOND BOOK,"What raised Antipater the Edomite,"
956,THE SECOND BOOK,"And his son Herod placed on Juda’s throne,"
957,THE SECOND BOOK,"Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends?"
958,THE SECOND BOOK,"Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,"
959,THE SECOND BOOK,"Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap—"
960,THE SECOND BOOK,"Not difficult, if thou hearken to me."
961,THE SECOND BOOK,"Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand;"
962,THE SECOND BOOK,"They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,     430"
963,THE SECOND BOOK,"While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want.”"
964,THE SECOND BOOK,To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:—
965,THE SECOND BOOK,“Yet wealth without these three is impotent
966,THE SECOND BOOK,"To gain dominion, or to keep it gained—"
967,THE SECOND BOOK,"Witness those ancient empires of the earth,"
968,THE SECOND BOOK,In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved;
969,THE SECOND BOOK,"But men endued with these have oft attained,"
970,THE SECOND BOOK,"In lowest poverty, to highest deeds—"
971,THE SECOND BOOK,"Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad"
972,THE SECOND BOOK,Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate     440
973,THE SECOND BOOK,"So many ages, and shall yet regain"
974,THE SECOND BOOK,"That seat, and reign in Israel without end."
975,THE SECOND BOOK,Among the Heathen (for throughout the world
976,THE SECOND BOOK,To me is not unknown what hath been done
977,THE SECOND BOOK,Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember
978,THE SECOND BOOK,"Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?"
979,THE SECOND BOOK,"For I esteem those names of men so poor,"
980,THE SECOND BOOK,"Who could do mighty things, and could contemn"
981,THE SECOND BOOK,"Riches, though offered from the hand of kings."
982,THE SECOND BOOK,And what in me seems wanting but that I     450
983,THE SECOND BOOK,May also in this poverty as soon
984,THE SECOND BOOK,"Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more?"
985,THE SECOND BOOK,"Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools,"
986,THE SECOND BOOK,"The wise man’s cumbrance, if not snare; more apt"
987,THE SECOND BOOK,To slacken virtue and abate her edge
988,THE SECOND BOOK,Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.
989,THE SECOND BOOK,What if with like aversion I reject
990,THE SECOND BOOK,"Riches and realms! Yet not for that a crown,"
991,THE SECOND BOOK,"Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns,"
992,THE SECOND BOOK,"Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights,     460"
993,THE SECOND BOOK,"To him who wears the regal diadem,"
994,THE SECOND BOOK,When on his shoulders each man’s burden lies;
995,THE SECOND BOOK,"For therein stands the office of a king,"
996,THE SECOND BOOK,"His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise,"
997,THE SECOND BOOK,That for the public all this weight he bears.
998,THE SECOND BOOK,"Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules"
999,THE SECOND BOOK,"Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king—"
1000,THE SECOND BOOK,Which every wise and virtuous man attains;
1001,THE SECOND BOOK,"And who attains not, ill aspires to rule"
1002,THE SECOND BOOK,"Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,     470"
1003,THE SECOND BOOK,"Subject himself to anarchy within,"
1004,THE SECOND BOOK,"Or lawless passions in him, which he serves."
1005,THE SECOND BOOK,But to guide nations in the way of truth
1006,THE SECOND BOOK,"By saving doctrine, and from error lead"
1007,THE SECOND BOOK,"To know, and, knowing, worship God aright,"
1008,THE SECOND BOOK,"Is yet more kingly. This attracts the soul,"
1009,THE SECOND BOOK,"Governs the inner man, the nobler part;"
1010,THE SECOND BOOK,"That other o’er the body only reigns,"
1011,THE SECOND BOOK,And oft by force—which to a generous mind
1012,THE SECOND BOOK,So reigning can be no sincere delight.     480
1013,THE SECOND BOOK,"Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought"
1014,THE SECOND BOOK,"Greater and nobler done, and to lay down"
1015,THE SECOND BOOK,"Far more magnanimous, than to assume."
1016,THE SECOND BOOK,"Riches are needless, then, both for themselves,"
1017,THE SECOND BOOK,And for thy reason why they should be sought—
1018,THE SECOND BOOK,"To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed.”"
1019,THE SECOND BOOK,
1020,THE SECOND BOOK,
1021,THE SECOND BOOK,
1022,THE SECOND BOOK,
1023,THE THIRD BOOK,THE THIRD BOOK
1024,THE THIRD BOOK,
1025,THE THIRD BOOK,
1026,THE THIRD BOOK,So spake the Son of God; and Satan stood
1027,THE THIRD BOOK,"A while as mute, confounded what to say,"
1028,THE THIRD BOOK,"What to reply, confuted and convinced"
1029,THE THIRD BOOK,Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift;
1030,THE THIRD BOOK,"At length, collecting all his serpent wiles,"
1031,THE THIRD BOOK,"With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:—"
1032,THE THIRD BOOK,"“I see thou know’st what is of use to know,"
1033,THE THIRD BOOK,"What best to say canst say, to do canst do;"
1034,THE THIRD BOOK,Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words
1035,THE THIRD BOOK,To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart     10
1036,THE THIRD BOOK,"Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape."
1037,THE THIRD BOOK,"Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult,"
1038,THE THIRD BOOK,Thy counsel would be as the oracle
1039,THE THIRD BOOK,"Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems"
1040,THE THIRD BOOK,"On Aaron’s breast, or tongue of Seers old"
1041,THE THIRD BOOK,"Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds"
1042,THE THIRD BOOK,"That might require the array of war, thy skill"
1043,THE THIRD BOOK,Of conduct would be such that all the world
1044,THE THIRD BOOK,"Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist"
1045,THE THIRD BOOK,"In battle, though against thy few in arms.     20"
1046,THE THIRD BOOK,These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide?
1047,THE THIRD BOOK,"Affecting private life, or more obscure"
1048,THE THIRD BOOK,"In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive"
1049,THE THIRD BOOK,"All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself"
1050,THE THIRD BOOK,"The fame and glory—glory, the reward"
1051,THE THIRD BOOK,That sole excites to high attempts the flame
1052,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure"
1053,THE THIRD BOOK,"AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise,"
1054,THE THIRD BOOK,"All treasures and all gain esteem as dross,"
1055,THE THIRD BOOK,"And dignities and powers, all but the highest?     30"
1056,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe. The son"
1057,THE THIRD BOOK,Of Macedonian Philip had ere these
1058,THE THIRD BOOK,"Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held"
1059,THE THIRD BOOK,At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down
1060,THE THIRD BOOK,The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled
1061,THE THIRD BOOK,"The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode."
1062,THE THIRD BOOK,"Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,"
1063,THE THIRD BOOK,"Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment."
1064,THE THIRD BOOK,"Great Julius, whom now all the world admires,"
1065,THE THIRD BOOK,"The more he grew in years, the more inflamed     40"
1066,THE THIRD BOOK,"With glory, wept that he had lived so long"
1067,THE THIRD BOOK,Ingloroious. But thou yet art not too late.”
1068,THE THIRD BOOK,To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:—
1069,THE THIRD BOOK,“Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth
1070,THE THIRD BOOK,"For empire’s sake, nor empire to affect"
1071,THE THIRD BOOK,"For glory’s sake, by all thy argument."
1072,THE THIRD BOOK,"For what is glory but the blaze of fame,"
1073,THE THIRD BOOK,"The people’s praise, if always praise unmixed?"
1074,THE THIRD BOOK,"And what the people but a herd confused,"
1075,THE THIRD BOOK,"A miscellaneous rabble, who extol     50"
1076,THE THIRD BOOK,"Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?"
1077,THE THIRD BOOK,"They praise and they admire they know not what,"
1078,THE THIRD BOOK,"And know not whom, but as one leads the other;"
1079,THE THIRD BOOK,"And what delight to be by such extolled,"
1080,THE THIRD BOOK,"To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?"
1081,THE THIRD BOOK,Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise—
1082,THE THIRD BOOK,His lot who dares be singularly good.
1083,THE THIRD BOOK,The intelligent among them and the wise
1084,THE THIRD BOOK,"Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised."
1085,THE THIRD BOOK,"This is true glory and renown—when God,     60"
1086,THE THIRD BOOK,"Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks"
1087,THE THIRD BOOK,"The just man, and divulges him through Heaven"
1088,THE THIRD BOOK,"To all his Angels, who with true applause"
1089,THE THIRD BOOK,"Recount his praises. Thus he did to Job,"
1090,THE THIRD BOOK,"When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth,"
1091,THE THIRD BOOK,"As thou to thy reproach may’st well remember,"
1092,THE THIRD BOOK,"He asked thee, ‘Hast thou seen my servant Job?’"
1093,THE THIRD BOOK,"Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known,"
1094,THE THIRD BOOK,"Where glory is false glory, attributed"
1095,THE THIRD BOOK,"To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.     70"
1096,THE THIRD BOOK,They err who count it glorious to subdue
1097,THE THIRD BOOK,"By conquest far and wide, to overrun"
1098,THE THIRD BOOK,"Large countries, and in field great battles win,"
1099,THE THIRD BOOK,Great cities by assault. What do these worthies
1100,THE THIRD BOOK,"But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave"
1101,THE THIRD BOOK,"Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote,"
1102,THE THIRD BOOK,"Made captive, yet deserving freedom more"
1103,THE THIRD BOOK,"Than those their conquerors, who leave behind"
1104,THE THIRD BOOK,"Nothing but ruin wheresoe’er they rove,"
1105,THE THIRD BOOK,And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;     80
1106,THE THIRD BOOK,"Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods,"
1107,THE THIRD BOOK,"Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,"
1108,THE THIRD BOOK,"Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?"
1109,THE THIRD BOOK,"One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;"
1110,THE THIRD BOOK,"Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men,"
1111,THE THIRD BOOK,"Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed,"
1112,THE THIRD BOOK,Violent or shameful death their due reward.
1113,THE THIRD BOOK,"But, if there be in glory aught of good;"
1114,THE THIRD BOOK,"It may be means far different be attained,"
1115,THE THIRD BOOK,"Without ambition, war, or violence—     90"
1116,THE THIRD BOOK,"By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,"
1117,THE THIRD BOOK,"By patience, temperance. I mention still"
1118,THE THIRD BOOK,"Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne,"
1119,THE THIRD BOOK,Made famous in a land and times obscure;
1120,THE THIRD BOOK,Who names not now with honour patient Job?
1121,THE THIRD BOOK,"Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?)"
1122,THE THIRD BOOK,"By what he taught and suffered for so doing,"
1123,THE THIRD BOOK,"For truth’s sake suffering death unjust, lives now"
1124,THE THIRD BOOK,Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.
1125,THE THIRD BOOK,"Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,     100"
1126,THE THIRD BOOK,Aught suffered—if young African for fame
1127,THE THIRD BOOK,His wasted country freed from Punic rage—
1128,THE THIRD BOOK,"The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least,"
1129,THE THIRD BOOK,"And loses, though but verbal, his reward."
1130,THE THIRD BOOK,"Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,"
1131,THE THIRD BOOK,"Oft not deserved? I seek not mine, but His"
1132,THE THIRD BOOK,"Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am.”"
1133,THE THIRD BOOK,"To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:—"
1134,THE THIRD BOOK,"“Think not so slight of glory, therein least"
1135,THE THIRD BOOK,"Resembling thy great Father. He seeks glory,     110"
1136,THE THIRD BOOK,"And for his glory all things made, all things"
1137,THE THIRD BOOK,"Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven,"
1138,THE THIRD BOOK,"By all his Angels glorified, requires"
1139,THE THIRD BOOK,"Glory from men, from all men, good or bad,"
1140,THE THIRD BOOK,"Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption."
1141,THE THIRD BOOK,"Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift,"
1142,THE THIRD BOOK,"Glory he requires, and glory he receives,"
1143,THE THIRD BOOK,"Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek,"
1144,THE THIRD BOOK,"Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared;"
1145,THE THIRD BOOK,"From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts.”     120"
1146,THE THIRD BOOK,To whom our Saviour fervently replied:
1147,THE THIRD BOOK,"“And reason; since his Word all things produced,"
1148,THE THIRD BOOK,"Though chiefly not for glory as prime end,"
1149,THE THIRD BOOK,"But to shew forth his goodness, and impart"
1150,THE THIRD BOOK,His good communicable to every soul
1151,THE THIRD BOOK,Freely; of whom what could He less expect
1152,THE THIRD BOOK,"Than glory and benediction—that is, thanks—"
1153,THE THIRD BOOK,"The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense"
1154,THE THIRD BOOK,"From them who could return him nothing else,"
1155,THE THIRD BOOK,"And, not returning that, would likeliest render     130"
1156,THE THIRD BOOK,"Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?"
1157,THE THIRD BOOK,"Hard recompense, unsuitable return"
1158,THE THIRD BOOK,"For so much good, so much beneficience!"
1159,THE THIRD BOOK,"But why should man seek glory, who of his own"
1160,THE THIRD BOOK,"Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs"
1161,THE THIRD BOOK,"But condemnation, ignominy, and shame—"
1162,THE THIRD BOOK,"Who, for so many benefits received,"
1163,THE THIRD BOOK,"Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false,"
1164,THE THIRD BOOK,And so of all true good himself despoiled;
1165,THE THIRD BOOK,"Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take     140"
1166,THE THIRD BOOK,That which to God alone of right belongs?
1167,THE THIRD BOOK,"Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace,"
1168,THE THIRD BOOK,"That who advances his glory, not their own,"
1169,THE THIRD BOOK,Them he himself to glory will advance.”
1170,THE THIRD BOOK,So spake the Son of God; and here again
1171,THE THIRD BOOK,"Satan had not to answer, but stood struck"
1172,THE THIRD BOOK,"With guilt of his own sin—for he himself,"
1173,THE THIRD BOOK,"Insatiable of glory, had lost all;"
1174,THE THIRD BOOK,Yet of another plea bethought him soon:—
1175,THE THIRD BOOK,"“Of glory, as thou wilt,” said he, “so deem;     150"
1176,THE THIRD BOOK,"Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass."
1177,THE THIRD BOOK,But to a Kingdom thou art born—ordained
1178,THE THIRD BOOK,"To sit upon thy father David’s throne,"
1179,THE THIRD BOOK,"By mother’s side thy father, though thy right"
1180,THE THIRD BOOK,"Be now in powerful hands, that will not part"
1181,THE THIRD BOOK,Easily from possession won with arms.
1182,THE THIRD BOOK,"Judaea now and all the Promised Land,"
1183,THE THIRD BOOK,"Reduced a province under Roman yoke,"
1184,THE THIRD BOOK,"Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled"
1185,THE THIRD BOOK,With temperate sway: oft have they violated     160
1186,THE THIRD BOOK,"The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts,"
1187,THE THIRD BOOK,"Abominations rather, as did once"
1188,THE THIRD BOOK,Antiochus. And think’st thou to regain
1189,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?"
1190,THE THIRD BOOK,So did not Machabeus. He indeed
1191,THE THIRD BOOK,"Retired unto the Desert, but with arms;"
1192,THE THIRD BOOK,And o’er a mighty king so oft prevailed
1193,THE THIRD BOOK,"That by strong hand his family obtained,"
1194,THE THIRD BOOK,"Though priests, the crown, and David’s throne usurped,"
1195,THE THIRD BOOK,With Modin and her suburbs once content.     170
1196,THE THIRD BOOK,"If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal"
1197,THE THIRD BOOK,"And duty—zeal and duty are not slow,"
1198,THE THIRD BOOK,But on Occasion’s forelock watchful wait:
1199,THE THIRD BOOK,They themselves rather are occasion best—
1200,THE THIRD BOOK,"Zeal of thy Father’s house, duty to free"
1201,THE THIRD BOOK,Thy country from her heathen servitude.
1202,THE THIRD BOOK,"So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify,"
1203,THE THIRD BOOK,"The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign—"
1204,THE THIRD BOOK,The happier reign the sooner it begins.
1205,THE THIRD BOOK,Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?”     180
1206,THE THIRD BOOK,To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:—
1207,THE THIRD BOOK,“All things are best fulfilled in their due time;
1208,THE THIRD BOOK,"And time there is for all things, Truth hath said."
1209,THE THIRD BOOK,If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told
1210,THE THIRD BOOK,"That it shall never end, so, when begin"
1211,THE THIRD BOOK,The Father in his purpose hath decreed—
1212,THE THIRD BOOK,He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.
1213,THE THIRD BOOK,What if he hath decreed that I shall first
1214,THE THIRD BOOK,"Be tried in humble state, and things adverse,"
1215,THE THIRD BOOK,"By tribulations, injuries, insults,     190"
1216,THE THIRD BOOK,"Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,"
1217,THE THIRD BOOK,"Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting"
1218,THE THIRD BOOK,"Without distrust or doubt, that He may know"
1219,THE THIRD BOOK,"What I can suffer, how obey? Who best"
1220,THE THIRD BOOK,"Can suffer best can do, best reign who first"
1221,THE THIRD BOOK,Well hath obeyed—just trial ere I merit
1222,THE THIRD BOOK,My exaltation without change or end.
1223,THE THIRD BOOK,But what concerns it thee when I begin
1224,THE THIRD BOOK,My everlasting Kingdom? Why art thou
1225,THE THIRD BOOK,Solicitous? What moves thy inquisition?     200
1226,THE THIRD BOOK,"Know’st thou not that my rising is thy fall,"
1227,THE THIRD BOOK,And my promotion will be thy destruction?”
1228,THE THIRD BOOK,"To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:—"
1229,THE THIRD BOOK,“Let that come when it comes. All hope is lost
1230,THE THIRD BOOK,Of my reception into grace; what worse?
1231,THE THIRD BOOK,For where no hope is left is left no fear.
1232,THE THIRD BOOK,"If there be worse, the expectation more"
1233,THE THIRD BOOK,Of worse torments me than the feeling can.
1234,THE THIRD BOOK,"I would be at the worst; worst is my port,"
1235,THE THIRD BOOK,"My harbour, and my ultimate repose,     210"
1236,THE THIRD BOOK,"The end I would attain, my final good."
1237,THE THIRD BOOK,"My error was my error, and my crime"
1238,THE THIRD BOOK,"My crime; whatever, for itself condemned,"
1239,THE THIRD BOOK,"And will alike be punished, whether thou"
1240,THE THIRD BOOK,Reign or reign not—though to that gentle brow
1241,THE THIRD BOOK,"Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign,"
1242,THE THIRD BOOK,"From that placid aspect and meek regard,"
1243,THE THIRD BOOK,"Rather than aggravate my evil state,"
1244,THE THIRD BOOK,Would stand between me and thy Father’s ire
1245,THE THIRD BOOK,(Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)     220
1246,THE THIRD BOOK,A shelter and a kind of shading cool
1247,THE THIRD BOOK,"Interposition, as a summer’s cloud."
1248,THE THIRD BOOK,"If I, then, to the worst that can be haste,"
1249,THE THIRD BOOK,Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?
1250,THE THIRD BOOK,"Happiest, both to thyself and all the world,"
1251,THE THIRD BOOK,"That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King!"
1252,THE THIRD BOOK,Perhaps thou linger’st in deep thoughts detained
1253,THE THIRD BOOK,Of the enterprise so hazardous and high!
1254,THE THIRD BOOK,"No wonder; for, though in thee be united"
1255,THE THIRD BOOK,"What of perfection can in Man be found,     230"
1256,THE THIRD BOOK,"Or human nature can receive, consider"
1257,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent"
1258,THE THIRD BOOK,"At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns,"
1259,THE THIRD BOOK,"And once a year Jerusalem, few days’"
1260,THE THIRD BOOK,Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe?
1261,THE THIRD BOOK,"The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory,"
1262,THE THIRD BOOK,"Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts—"
1263,THE THIRD BOOK,"Best school of best experience, quickest in sight"
1264,THE THIRD BOOK,In all things that to greatest actions lead.
1265,THE THIRD BOOK,"The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever     240"
1266,THE THIRD BOOK,"Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty"
1267,THE THIRD BOOK,"(As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom)"
1268,THE THIRD BOOK,"Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous."
1269,THE THIRD BOOK,But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit
1270,THE THIRD BOOK,"Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes"
1271,THE THIRD BOOK,"The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state—"
1272,THE THIRD BOOK,Sufficient introduction to inform
1273,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts,"
1274,THE THIRD BOOK,And regal mysteries; that thou may’st know
1275,THE THIRD BOOK,How best their opposition to withstand.”     250
1276,THE THIRD BOOK,"With that (such power was given him then), he took"
1277,THE THIRD BOOK,The Son of God up to a mountain high.
1278,THE THIRD BOOK,It was a mountain at whose verdant feet
1279,THE THIRD BOOK,A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide
1280,THE THIRD BOOK,"Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed,"
1281,THE THIRD BOOK,"The one winding, the other straight, and left between"
1282,THE THIRD BOOK,"Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined,"
1283,THE THIRD BOOK,Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea.
1284,THE THIRD BOOK,"Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine;"
1285,THE THIRD BOOK,"With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;     260"
1286,THE THIRD BOOK,"Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem"
1287,THE THIRD BOOK,The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large
1288,THE THIRD BOOK,The prospect was that here and there was room
1289,THE THIRD BOOK,"For barren desert, fountainless and dry."
1290,THE THIRD BOOK,To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought
1291,THE THIRD BOOK,"Our Saviour, and new train of words began:—"
1292,THE THIRD BOOK,"“Well have we speeded, and o’er hill and dale,"
1293,THE THIRD BOOK,"Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers,"
1294,THE THIRD BOOK,Cut shorter many a league. Here thou behold’st
1295,THE THIRD BOOK,"Assyria, and her empire’s ancient bounds,     270"
1296,THE THIRD BOOK,Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on
1297,THE THIRD BOOK,"As far as Indus east, Euphrates west,"
1298,THE THIRD BOOK,"And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay,"
1299,THE THIRD BOOK,"And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth:"
1300,THE THIRD BOOK,"Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall"
1301,THE THIRD BOOK,"Several days’ journey, built by Ninus old,"
1302,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of that first golden monarchy the seat,"
1303,THE THIRD BOOK,"And seat of Salmanassar, whose success"
1304,THE THIRD BOOK,Israel in long captivity still mourns;
1305,THE THIRD BOOK,"There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,     280"
1306,THE THIRD BOOK,"As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice"
1307,THE THIRD BOOK,Judah and all thy father David’s house
1308,THE THIRD BOOK,"Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste,"
1309,THE THIRD BOOK,"Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis,"
1310,THE THIRD BOOK,"His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there;"
1311,THE THIRD BOOK,"Ecbatana her structure vast there shews,"
1312,THE THIRD BOOK,And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates;
1313,THE THIRD BOOK,"There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream,"
1314,THE THIRD BOOK,"The drink of none but kings; of later fame,"
1315,THE THIRD BOOK,"Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,     290"
1316,THE THIRD BOOK,"The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there"
1317,THE THIRD BOOK,"Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon,"
1318,THE THIRD BOOK,"Turning with easy eye, thou may’st behold."
1319,THE THIRD BOOK,All these the Parthian (now some ages past
1320,THE THIRD BOOK,"By great Arsaces led, who founded first"
1321,THE THIRD BOOK,"That empire) under his dominion holds,"
1322,THE THIRD BOOK,From the luxurious kings of Antioch won.
1323,THE THIRD BOOK,And just in time thou com’st to have a view
1324,THE THIRD BOOK,Of his great power; for now the Parthian king
1325,THE THIRD BOOK,In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host     300
1326,THE THIRD BOOK,"Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild"
1327,THE THIRD BOOK,Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid
1328,THE THIRD BOOK,"He marches now in haste. See, though from far,"
1329,THE THIRD BOOK,"His thousands, in what martial equipage"
1330,THE THIRD BOOK,"They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms,"
1331,THE THIRD BOOK,Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit—
1332,THE THIRD BOOK,"All horsemen, in which fight they most excel;"
1333,THE THIRD BOOK,"See how in warlike muster they appear,"
1334,THE THIRD BOOK,"In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings.”"
1335,THE THIRD BOOK,"He looked, and saw what numbers numberless     310"
1336,THE THIRD BOOK,"The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops"
1337,THE THIRD BOOK,In coats of mail and military pride.
1338,THE THIRD BOOK,"In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong,"
1339,THE THIRD BOOK,"Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice"
1340,THE THIRD BOOK,Of many provinces from bound to bound—
1341,THE THIRD BOOK,"From Arachosia, from Candaor east,"
1342,THE THIRD BOOK,"And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs"
1343,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;"
1344,THE THIRD BOOK,"From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains"
1345,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of Adiabene, Media, and the south     320"
1346,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of Susiana, to Balsara’s haven."
1347,THE THIRD BOOK,"He saw them in their forms of battle ranged,"
1348,THE THIRD BOOK,"How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot"
1349,THE THIRD BOOK,Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face
1350,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight;"
1351,THE THIRD BOOK,The field all iron cast a gleaming brown.
1352,THE THIRD BOOK,"Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn,"
1353,THE THIRD BOOK,"Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight,"
1354,THE THIRD BOOK,"Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers"
1355,THE THIRD BOOK,Of archers; nor of labouring pioners     330
1356,THE THIRD BOOK,"A multitude, with spades and axes armed,"
1357,THE THIRD BOOK,"To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,"
1358,THE THIRD BOOK,"Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay"
1359,THE THIRD BOOK,"With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke:"
1360,THE THIRD BOOK,"Mules after these, camels and dromedaries,"
1361,THE THIRD BOOK,And waggons fraught with utensils of war.
1362,THE THIRD BOOK,"Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,"
1363,THE THIRD BOOK,"When Agrican, with all his northern powers,"
1364,THE THIRD BOOK,"Besieged Albracea, as romances tell,"
1365,THE THIRD BOOK,"The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win     340"
1366,THE THIRD BOOK,"The fairest of her sex, Angelica,"
1367,THE THIRD BOOK,"His daughter, sought by many prowest knights,"
1368,THE THIRD BOOK,Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane.
1369,THE THIRD BOOK,Such and so numerous was their chivalry;
1370,THE THIRD BOOK,"At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed,"
1371,THE THIRD BOOK,And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:—
1372,THE THIRD BOOK,“That thou may’st know I seek not to engage
1373,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thy virtue, and not every way secure"
1374,THE THIRD BOOK,"On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark"
1375,THE THIRD BOOK,"To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew     350"
1376,THE THIRD BOOK,"All this fair sight. Thy kingdom, though foretold"
1377,THE THIRD BOOK,"By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou"
1378,THE THIRD BOOK,"Endeavour, as thy father David did,"
1379,THE THIRD BOOK,Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still
1380,THE THIRD BOOK,"In all things, and all men, supposes means;"
1381,THE THIRD BOOK,"Without means used, what it predicts revokes."
1382,THE THIRD BOOK,But say thou wert possessed of David’s throne
1383,THE THIRD BOOK,"By free consent of all, none opposite,"
1384,THE THIRD BOOK,Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope
1385,THE THIRD BOOK,Long to enjoy it quiet and secure     360
1386,THE THIRD BOOK,"Between two such enclosing enemies,"
1387,THE THIRD BOOK,Roman and Parthian? Therefore one of these
1388,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first,"
1389,THE THIRD BOOK,"By my advice, as nearer, and of late"
1390,THE THIRD BOOK,Found able by invasion to annoy
1391,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thy country, and captive lead away her kings,"
1392,THE THIRD BOOK,"Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound,"
1393,THE THIRD BOOK,Maugre the Roman. It shall be my task
1394,THE THIRD BOOK,"To render thee the Parthian at dispose,"
1395,THE THIRD BOOK,"Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.     370"
1396,THE THIRD BOOK,"By him thou shalt regain, without him not,"
1397,THE THIRD BOOK,That which alone can truly reinstall thee
1398,THE THIRD BOOK,"In David’s royal seat, his true successor—"
1399,THE THIRD BOOK,"Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes"
1400,THE THIRD BOOK,Whose offspring in his territory yet serve
1401,THE THIRD BOOK,"In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed:"
1402,THE THIRD BOOK,"The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost"
1403,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old"
1404,THE THIRD BOOK,"Their fathers in the land of Egypt served,"
1405,THE THIRD BOOK,This offer sets before thee to deliver.     380
1406,THE THIRD BOOK,These if from servitude thou shalt restore
1407,THE THIRD BOOK,"To their inheritance, then, nor till then,"
1408,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thou on the throne of David in full glory,"
1409,THE THIRD BOOK,"From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond,"
1410,THE THIRD BOOK,"Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear.”"
1411,THE THIRD BOOK,"To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:—"
1412,THE THIRD BOOK,“Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm
1413,THE THIRD BOOK,"And fragile arms, much instrument of war,"
1414,THE THIRD BOOK,"Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought,"
1415,THE THIRD BOOK,"Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear     390"
1416,THE THIRD BOOK,"Vented much policy, and projects deep"
1417,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues,"
1418,THE THIRD BOOK,"Plausible to the world, to me worth naught."
1419,THE THIRD BOOK,"Means I must use, thou say’st; prediction else"
1420,THE THIRD BOOK,"Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne!"
1421,THE THIRD BOOK,"My time, I told thee (and that time for thee"
1422,THE THIRD BOOK,"Were better farthest off), is not yet come."
1423,THE THIRD BOOK,"When that comes, think not thou to find me slack"
1424,THE THIRD BOOK,"On my part aught endeavouring, or to need"
1425,THE THIRD BOOK,"Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome     400"
1426,THE THIRD BOOK,Luggage of war there shewn me—argument
1427,THE THIRD BOOK,Of human weakness rather than of strength.
1428,THE THIRD BOOK,"My brethren, as thou call’st them, those Ten Tribes,"
1429,THE THIRD BOOK,"I must deliver, if I mean to reign"
1430,THE THIRD BOOK,"David’s true heir, and his full sceptre sway"
1431,THE THIRD BOOK,To just extent over all Israel’s sons!
1432,THE THIRD BOOK,But whence to thee this zeal? Where was it then
1433,THE THIRD BOOK,"For Israel, or for David, or his throne,"
1434,THE THIRD BOOK,When thou stood’st up his tempter to the pride
1435,THE THIRD BOOK,Of numbering Israel—which cost the lives     410
1436,THE THIRD BOOK,of threescore and ten thousand Israelites
1437,THE THIRD BOOK,By three days’ pestilence? Such was thy zeal
1438,THE THIRD BOOK,"To Israel then, the same that now to me."
1439,THE THIRD BOOK,"As for those captive tribes, themselves were they"
1440,THE THIRD BOOK,"Who wrought their own captivity, fell off"
1441,THE THIRD BOOK,"From God to worship calves, the deities"
1442,THE THIRD BOOK,"Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth,"
1443,THE THIRD BOOK,"And all the idolatries of heathen round,"
1444,THE THIRD BOOK,Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes;
1445,THE THIRD BOOK,Nor in the land of their captivity     420
1446,THE THIRD BOOK,"Humbled themselves, or penitent besought"
1447,THE THIRD BOOK,"The God of their forefathers, but so died"
1448,THE THIRD BOOK,"Impenitent, and left a race behind"
1449,THE THIRD BOOK,"Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce"
1450,THE THIRD BOOK,"From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain,"
1451,THE THIRD BOOK,And God with idols in their worship joined.
1452,THE THIRD BOOK,"Should I of these the liberty regard,"
1453,THE THIRD BOOK,"Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony,"
1454,THE THIRD BOOK,"Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed,"
1455,THE THIRD BOOK,"Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps     430"
1456,THE THIRD BOOK,Of Bethel and of Dan? No; let them serve
1457,THE THIRD BOOK,Their enemies who serve idols with God.
1458,THE THIRD BOOK,"Yet He at length, time to himself best known,"
1459,THE THIRD BOOK,"Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call"
1460,THE THIRD BOOK,"May bring them back, repentant and sincere,"
1461,THE THIRD BOOK,"And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood,"
1462,THE THIRD BOOK,"While to their native land with joy they haste,"
1463,THE THIRD BOOK,"As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft,"
1464,THE THIRD BOOK,When to the Promised Land their fathers passed.
1465,THE THIRD BOOK,To his due time and providence I leave them.”     440
1466,THE THIRD BOOK,"So spake Israel’s true King, and to the Fiend"
1467,THE THIRD BOOK,"Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles."
1468,THE THIRD BOOK,So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.

1495,THE FOURTH BOOK,(Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end—     20
1496,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse"
1497,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Met ever, and to shameful silence brought,"
1498,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Yet gives not o’er, though desperate of success,"
1499,THE FOURTH BOOK,And his vain importunity pursues.
1500,THE FOURTH BOOK,He brought our Saviour to the western side
1501,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of that high mountain, whence he might behold"
1502,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide,"
1503,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Washed by the southern sea, and on the north"
1504,THE FOURTH BOOK,To equal length backed with a ridge of hills
1505,THE FOURTH BOOK,That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men     30
1506,THE FOURTH BOOK,From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst
1507,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Divided by a river, off whose banks"
1508,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On each side an Imperial City stood,"
1509,THE FOURTH BOOK,With towers and temples proudly elevate
1510,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On seven small hills, with palaces adorned,"
1511,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts,"
1512,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs,"
1513,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes"
1514,THE FOURTH BOOK,Above the highth of mountains interposed—
1515,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By what strange parallax, or optic skill     40"
1516,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass"
1517,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of telescope, were curious to enquire."
1518,THE FOURTH BOOK,And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:—
1519,THE FOURTH BOOK,“The city which thou seest no other deem
1520,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth"
1521,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched"
1522,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of nations. There the Capitol thou seest,"
1523,THE FOURTH BOOK,Above the rest lifting his stately head
1524,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel"
1525,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine,     50"
1526,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The imperial palace, compass huge, and high"
1527,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The structure, skill of noblest architects,"
1528,THE FOURTH BOOK,"With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,"
1529,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires."
1530,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Many a fair edifice besides, more like"
1531,THE FOURTH BOOK,Houses of gods—so well I have disposed
1532,THE FOURTH BOOK,"My aerie microscope—thou may’st behold,"
1533,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs"
1534,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Carved work, the hand of famed artificers"
1535,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold.     60"
1536,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see"
1537,THE FOURTH BOOK,"What conflux issuing forth, or entering in:"
1538,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces"
1539,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Hasting, or on return, in robes of state;"
1540,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power;"
1541,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings;"
1542,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or embassies from regions far remote,"
1543,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In various habits, on the Appian road,"
1544,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or on the AEmilian—some from farthest south,"
1545,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,     70"
1546,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west,"
1547,THE FOURTH BOOK,The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea;
1548,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these),"
1549,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From India and the Golden Chersoness,"
1550,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And utmost Indian isle Taprobane,"
1551,THE FOURTH BOOK,Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed;
1552,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From Gallia, Gades, and the British west;"
1553,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north"
1554,THE FOURTH BOOK,Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool.
1555,THE FOURTH BOOK,All nations now to Rome obedience pay—     80
1556,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To Rome’s great Emperor, whose wide domain,"
1557,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In ample territory, wealth and power,"
1558,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Civility of manners, arts and arms,"
1559,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And long renown, thou justly may’st prefer"
1560,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Before the Parthian. These two thrones except,"
1561,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight,"
1562,THE FOURTH BOOK,Shared among petty kings too far removed;
1563,THE FOURTH BOOK,"These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all"
1564,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory."
1565,THE FOURTH BOOK,"This Emperor hath no son, and now is old,     90"
1566,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired"
1567,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To Capreae, an island small but strong"
1568,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On the Campanian shore, with purpose there"
1569,THE FOURTH BOOK,His horrid lusts in private to enjoy;
1570,THE FOURTH BOOK,Committing to a wicked favourite
1571,THE FOURTH BOOK,"All public cares, and yet of him suspicious;"
1572,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Hated of all, and hating. With what ease,"
1573,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Endued with regal virtues as thou art,"
1574,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Appearing, and beginning noble deeds,"
1575,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Might’st thou expel this monster from his throne,     100"
1576,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending,"
1577,THE FOURTH BOOK,A victor-people free from servile yoke!
1578,THE FOURTH BOOK,And with my help thou may’st; to me the power
1579,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Is given, and by that right I give it thee."
1580,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world;"
1581,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Aim at the highest; without the highest attained,"
1582,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Will be for thee no sitting, or not long,"
1583,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On David’s throne, be prophesied what will.”"
1584,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:—"
1585,THE FOURTH BOOK,“Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew     110
1586,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of luxury, though called magnificence,"
1587,THE FOURTH BOOK,"More than of arms before, allure mine eye,"
1588,THE FOURTH BOOK,Much less my mind; though thou should’st add to tell
1589,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts"
1590,THE FOURTH BOOK,On citron tables or Atlantic stone
1591,THE FOURTH BOOK,"(For I have also heard, perhaps have read),"
1592,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne,"
1593,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold,"
1594,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems"
1595,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And studs of pearl—to me should’st tell, who thirst     120"
1596,THE FOURTH BOOK,And hunger still. Then embassies thou shew’st
1597,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From nations far and nigh! What honour that,"
1598,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear"
1599,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So many hollow compliments and lies,"
1600,THE FOURTH BOOK,Outlandish flatteries? Then proceed’st to talk
1601,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of the Emperor, how easily subdued,"
1602,THE FOURTH BOOK,"How gloriously. I shall, thou say’st, expel"
1603,THE FOURTH BOOK,A brutish monster: what if I withal
1604,THE FOURTH BOOK,Expel a Devil who first made him such?
1605,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out;     130"
1606,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For him I was not sent, nor yet to free"
1607,THE FOURTH BOOK,"That people, victor once, now vile and base,"
1608,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Deservedly made vassal—who, once just,"
1609,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well,"
1610,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But govern ill the nations under yoke,"
1611,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Peeling their provinces, exhausted all"
1612,THE FOURTH BOOK,By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown
1613,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of triumph, that insulting vanity;"
1614,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured"
1615,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed;     140"
1616,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still,"
1617,THE FOURTH BOOK,And from the daily Scene effeminate.
1618,THE FOURTH BOOK,What wise and valiant man would seek to free
1619,THE FOURTH BOOK,"These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved,"
1620,THE FOURTH BOOK,Or could of inward slaves make outward free?
1621,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit"
1622,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On David’s throne, it shall be like a tree"
1623,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Spreading and overshadowing all the earth,"
1624,THE FOURTH BOOK,Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash
1625,THE FOURTH BOOK,All monarchies besides throughout the world;     150
1626,THE FOURTH BOOK,And of my Kingdom there shall be no end.
1627,THE FOURTH BOOK,Means there shall be to this; but what the means
1628,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell.”"
1629,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:—"
1630,THE FOURTH BOOK,“I see all offers made by me how slight
1631,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thou valuest, because offered, and reject’st."
1632,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Nothing will please the difficult and nice,"
1633,THE FOURTH BOOK,Or nothing more than still to contradict.
1634,THE FOURTH BOOK,On the other side know also thou that I
1635,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On what I offer set as high esteem,     160"
1636,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Nor what I part with mean to give for naught,"
1637,THE FOURTH BOOK,"All these, which in a moment thou behold’st,"
1638,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give"
1639,THE FOURTH BOOK,"(For, given to me, I give to whom I please),"
1640,THE FOURTH BOOK,"No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else—"
1641,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On this condition, if thou wilt fall down,"
1642,THE FOURTH BOOK,And worship me as thy superior Lord
1643,THE FOURTH BOOK,"(Easily done), and hold them all of me;"
1644,THE FOURTH BOOK,For what can less so great a gift deserve?”
1645,THE FOURTH BOOK,Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:—     170
1646,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“I never liked thy talk, thy offers less;"
1647,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter"
1648,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The abominable terms, impious condition."
1649,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But I endure the time, till which expired"
1650,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thou hast permission on me. It is written,"
1651,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The first of all commandments, ‘Thou shalt worship"
1652,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.’"
1653,THE FOURTH BOOK,And dar’st thou to the Son of God propound
1654,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed"
1655,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve,     180"
1656,THE FOURTH BOOK,And more blasphemous; which expect to rue.
1657,THE FOURTH BOOK,The kingdoms of the world to thee were given!
1658,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Permitted rather, and by thee usurped;"
1659,THE FOURTH BOOK,Other donation none thou canst produce.
1660,THE FOURTH BOOK,"If given, by whom but by the King of kings,"
1661,THE FOURTH BOOK,"God over all supreme? If given to thee,"
1662,THE FOURTH BOOK,By thee how fairly is the Giver now
1663,THE FOURTH BOOK,Repaid! But gratitude in thee is lost
1664,THE FOURTH BOOK,Long since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame
1665,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As offer them to me, the Son of God—     190"
1666,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To me my own, on such abhorred pact,"
1667,THE FOURTH BOOK,That I fall down and worship thee as God?
1668,THE FOURTH BOOK,Get thee behind me! Plain thou now appear’st
1669,THE FOURTH BOOK,"That Evil One, Satan for ever damned.”"
1670,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:—"
1671,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“Be not so sore offended, Son of God—"
1672,THE FOURTH BOOK,Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men—
1673,THE FOURTH BOOK,"If I, to try whether in higher sort"
1674,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Than these thou bear’st that title, have proposed"
1675,THE FOURTH BOOK,"What both from Men and Angels I receive,     200"
1676,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth"
1677,THE FOURTH BOOK,Nations besides from all the quartered winds—
1678,THE FOURTH BOOK,"God of this World invoked, and World beneath."
1679,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold"
1680,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To me most fatal, me it most concerns."
1681,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The trial hath indamaged thee no way,"
1682,THE FOURTH BOOK,Rather more honour left and more esteem;
1683,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed."
1684,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Therefore let pass, as they are transitory,"
1685,THE FOURTH BOOK,The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more     210
1686,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not."
1687,THE FOURTH BOOK,And thou thyself seem’st otherwise inclined
1688,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Than to a worldly crown, addicted more"
1689,THE FOURTH BOOK,To contemplation and profound dispute;
1690,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As by that early action may be judged,"
1691,THE FOURTH BOOK,"When, slipping from thy mother’s eye, thou went’st"
1692,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Alone into the Temple, there wast found"
1693,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant"
1694,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On points and questions fitting Moses’ chair,"
1695,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Teaching, not taught. The childhood shews the man,     220"
1696,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As morning shews the day. Be famous, then,"
1697,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By wisdom; as thy empire must extend,"
1698,THE FOURTH BOOK,So let extend thy mind o’er all the world
1699,THE FOURTH BOOK,In knowledge; all things in it comprehend.
1700,THE FOURTH BOOK,"All knowledge is not couched in Moses’ law,"
1701,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote;"
1702,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach"
1703,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To admiration, led by Nature’s light;"
1704,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And with the Gentiles much thou must converse,"
1705,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean’st.     230"
1706,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Without their learning, how wilt thou with them,"
1707,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or they with thee, hold conversation meet?"
1708,THE FOURTH BOOK,"How wilt thou reason with them, how refute"
1709,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes?"
1710,THE FOURTH BOOK,Error by his own arms is best evinced.
1711,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount,"
1712,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold"
1713,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Where on the AEgean shore a city stands,"
1714,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil—"
1715,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts     240"
1716,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And Eloquence, native to famous wits"
1717,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or hospitable, in her sweet recess,"
1718,THE FOURTH BOOK,"City or suburban, studious walks and shades."
1719,THE FOURTH BOOK,"See there the olive-grove of Academe,"
1720,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Plato’s retirement, where the Attic bird"
1721,THE FOURTH BOOK,Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long;
1722,THE FOURTH BOOK,"There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound"
1723,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of bees’ industrious murmur, oft invites"
1724,THE FOURTH BOOK,To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls
1725,THE FOURTH BOOK,His whispering stream. Within the walls then view     250
1726,THE FOURTH BOOK,The schools of ancient sages—his who bred
1727,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Great Alexander to subdue the world,"
1728,THE FOURTH BOOK,Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next.
1729,THE FOURTH BOOK,There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power
1730,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit"
1731,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,"
1732,THE FOURTH BOOK,"AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,"
1733,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,"
1734,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called,"
1735,THE FOURTH BOOK,Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.     260
1736,THE FOURTH BOOK,Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught
1737,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In chorus or iambic, teachers best"
1738,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of moral prudence, with delight received"
1739,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In brief sententious precepts, while they treat"
1740,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of fate, and chance, and change in human life,"
1741,THE FOURTH BOOK,High actions and high passions best describing.
1742,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thence to the famous Orators repair,"
1743,THE FOURTH BOOK,Those ancient whose resistless eloquence
1744,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Wielded at will that fierce democraty,"
1745,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece     270"
1746,THE FOURTH BOOK,To Macedon and Artaxerxes’ throne.
1747,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,"
1748,THE FOURTH BOOK,From heaven descended to the low-roofed house
1749,THE FOURTH BOOK,Of Socrates—see there his tenement—
1750,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced"
1751,THE FOURTH BOOK,Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth
1752,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools"
1753,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of Academics old and new, with those"
1754,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect"
1755,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.     280"
1756,THE FOURTH BOOK,"These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home,"
1757,THE FOURTH BOOK,Till time mature thee to a kingdom’s weight;
1758,THE FOURTH BOOK,These rules will render thee a king complete
1759,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Within thyself, much more with empire joined.”"
1760,THE FOURTH BOOK,To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:—
1761,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“Think not but that I know these things; or, think"
1762,THE FOURTH BOOK,"I know them not, not therefore am I short"
1763,THE FOURTH BOOK,Of knowing what I ought. He who receives
1764,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Light from above, from the Fountain of Light,"
1765,THE FOURTH BOOK,"No other doctrine needs, though granted true;     290"
1766,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But these are false, or little else but dreams,"
1767,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm."
1768,THE FOURTH BOOK,The first and wisest of them all professed
1769,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To know this only, that he nothing knew;"
1770,THE FOURTH BOOK,The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits;
1771,THE FOURTH BOOK,"A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense;"
1772,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Others in virtue placed felicity,"
1773,THE FOURTH BOOK,But virtue joined with riches and long life;
1774,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease;"
1775,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Stoic last in philosophic pride,     300"
1776,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By him called virtue, and his virtuous man,"
1777,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing,"
1778,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer,"
1779,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As fearing God nor man, contemning all"
1780,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life—"
1781,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can;"
1782,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For all his tedious talk is but vain boast,"
1783,THE FOURTH BOOK,Or subtle shifts conviction to evade.
1784,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead,"
1785,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Ignorant of themselves, of God much more,     310"
1786,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And how the World began, and how Man fell,"
1787,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Degraded by himself, on grace depending?"
1788,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry;"
1789,THE FOURTH BOOK,And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves
1790,THE FOURTH BOOK,"All glory arrogate, to God give none;"
1791,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Rather accuse him under usual names,"
1792,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite"
1793,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of mortal things. Who, therefore, seeks in these"
1794,THE FOURTH BOOK,"True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion"
1795,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,     320"
1796,THE FOURTH BOOK,"An empty cloud. However, many books,"
1797,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads"
1798,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Incessantly, and to his reading brings not"
1799,THE FOURTH BOOK,"A spirit and judgment equal or superior,"
1800,THE FOURTH BOOK,(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)
1801,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Uncertain and unsettled still remains,"
1802,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,"
1803,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys"
1804,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,"
1805,THE FOURTH BOOK,As children gathering pebbles on the shore.     330
1806,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or, if I would delight my private hours"
1807,THE FOURTH BOOK,"With music or with poem, where so soon"
1808,THE FOURTH BOOK,As in our native language can I find
1809,THE FOURTH BOOK,That solace? All our Law and Story strewed
1810,THE FOURTH BOOK,"With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed,"
1811,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon"
1812,THE FOURTH BOOK,"That pleased so well our victor’s ear, declare"
1813,THE FOURTH BOOK,That rather Greece from us these arts derived—
1814,THE FOURTH BOOK,Ill imitated while they loudest sing
1815,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The vices of their deities, and their own,     340"
1816,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In fable, hymn, or song, so personating"
1817,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame."
1818,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid"
1819,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As varnish on a harlot’s cheek, the rest,"
1820,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight,"
1821,THE FOURTH BOOK,Will far be found unworthy to compare
1822,THE FOURTH BOOK,"With Sion’s songs, to all true tastes excelling,"
1823,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Where God is praised aright and godlike men,"
1824,THE FOURTH BOOK,The Holiest of Holies and his Saints
1825,THE FOURTH BOOK,"(Such are from God inspired, not such from thee);     350"
1826,THE FOURTH BOOK,Unless where moral virtue is expressed
1827,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By light of Nature, not in all quite lost."
1828,THE FOURTH BOOK,Their orators thou then extoll’st as those
1829,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The top of eloquence—statists indeed,"
1830,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And lovers of their country, as may seem;"
1831,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But herein to our Prophets far beneath,"
1832,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As men divinely taught, and better teaching"
1833,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The solid rules of civil government,"
1834,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In their majestic, unaffected style,"
1835,THE FOURTH BOOK,Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome.     360
1836,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt,"

1838,THE FOURTH BOOK,"What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat;"
1839,THE FOURTH BOOK,"These only, with our Law, best form a king.”"
1840,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now"
1841,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent),"
1842,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:—"

1847,THE FOURTH BOOK,What dost thou in this world? The Wilderness
1848,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,"
1849,THE FOURTH BOOK,And thither will return thee. Yet remember
1850,THE FOURTH BOOK,What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause
1851,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus"
1852,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,"
1853,THE FOURTH BOOK,Which would have set thee in short time with ease
1854,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On David’s throne, or throne of all the world,"
1855,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,     380"
1856,THE FOURTH BOOK,When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.
1857,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Now, contrary—if I read aught in heaven,"
1858,THE FOURTH BOOK,Or heaven write aught of fate—by what the stars
1859,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Voluminous, or single characters"
1860,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In their conjunction met, give me to spell,"
1861,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,"
1862,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,"
1863,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death."
1864,THE FOURTH BOOK,"A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,"
1865,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Real or allegoric, I discern not;     390"
1866,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Nor when: eternal sure—as without end,"
1867,THE FOURTH BOOK,Without beginning; for no date prefixed
1868,THE FOURTH BOOK,Directs me in the starry rubric set.”
1869,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So saying, he took (for still he knew his power"
1870,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness"
1871,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,"
1872,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose,"
1873,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,"
1874,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,"
1875,THE FOURTH BOOK,Privation mere of light and absent day.     400
1876,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind"
1877,THE FOURTH BOOK,"After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,"
1878,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,"
1879,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Wherever, under some concourse of shades,"
1880,THE FOURTH BOOK,Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield
1881,THE FOURTH BOOK,From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;
1882,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head"
1883,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams"
1884,THE FOURTH BOOK,Disturbed his sleep. And either tropic now
1885,THE FOURTH BOOK,"’Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds     410"
1886,THE FOURTH BOOK,From many a horrid rift abortive poured
1887,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,"
1888,THE FOURTH BOOK,In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds
1889,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad"
1890,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From the four hinges of the world, and fell"
1891,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,"
1892,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,"
1893,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,"
1894,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or torn up sheer. Ill wast thou shrouded then,"
1895,THE FOURTH BOOK,"O patient Son of God, yet only stood’st     420"
1896,THE FOURTH BOOK,Unshaken! Nor yet staid the terror there:
1897,THE FOURTH BOOK,Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round
1898,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,"
1899,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou"
1900,THE FOURTH BOOK,Sat’st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.
1901,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair"
1902,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,"
1903,THE FOURTH BOOK,Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar
1904,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,"
1905,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised     430"
1906,THE FOURTH BOOK,To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.
1907,THE FOURTH BOOK,And now the sun with more effectual beams
1908,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet"
1909,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,"
1910,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Who all things now behold more fresh and green,"
1911,THE FOURTH BOOK,"After a night of storm so ruinous,"
1912,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,"
1913,THE FOURTH BOOK,To gratulate the sweet return of morn.
1914,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,"
1915,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Was absent, after all his mischief done,     440"
1916,THE FOURTH BOOK,The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem
1917,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;"
1918,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Yet with no new device (they all were spent),"
1919,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Rather by this his last affront resolved,"
1920,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Desperate of better course, to vent his rage"
1921,THE FOURTH BOOK,And mad despite to be so oft repelled.
1922,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Him walking on a sunny hill he found,"
1923,THE FOURTH BOOK,Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;
1924,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,"
1925,THE FOURTH BOOK,And in a careless mood thus to him said:—     450
1926,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,"
1927,THE FOURTH BOOK,"After a dismal night. I heard the wrack,"
1928,THE FOURTH BOOK,As earth and sky would mingle; but myself
1929,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,"
1930,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,"
1931,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or to the Earth’s dark basis underneath,"
1932,THE FOURTH BOOK,Are to the main as inconsiderable
1933,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze"
1934,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To man’s less universe, and soon are gone."
1935,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light     460"
1936,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,"
1937,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,"
1938,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,"
1939,THE FOURTH BOOK,They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.
1940,THE FOURTH BOOK,This tempest at this desert most was bent;
1941,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell’st."
1942,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject"
1943,THE FOURTH BOOK,The perfect season offered with my aid
1944,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong"
1945,THE FOURTH BOOK,"All to the push of fate, pursue thy way     470"
1946,THE FOURTH BOOK,Of gaining David’s throne no man knows when
1947,THE FOURTH BOOK,"(For both the when and how is nowhere told),"
1948,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;"
1949,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing"
1950,THE FOURTH BOOK,The time and means? Each act is rightliest done
1951,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Not when it must, but when it may be best."
1952,THE FOURTH BOOK,"If thou observe not this, be sure to find"
1953,THE FOURTH BOOK,What I foretold thee—many a hard assay
1954,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,"
1955,THE FOURTH BOOK,Ere thou of Israel’s sceptre get fast hold;     480
1956,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,"
1957,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So many terrors, voices, prodigies,"
1958,THE FOURTH BOOK,"May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign.”"
1959,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So talked he, while the Son of God went on,"
1960,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:—"
1961,THE FOURTH BOOK,“Me worse than wet thou find’st not; other harm
1962,THE FOURTH BOOK,Those terrors which thou speak’st of did me none.
1963,THE FOURTH BOOK,"I never feared they could, though noising loud"
1964,THE FOURTH BOOK,And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs
1965,THE FOURTH BOOK,Betokening or ill-boding I contemn     490
1966,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;"
1967,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,"
1968,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Obtrud’st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,"
1969,THE FOURTH BOOK,"At least might seem to hold all power of thee,"
1970,THE FOURTH BOOK,Ambitious Spirit! and would’st be thought my God;
1971,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And storm’st, refused, thinking to terrify"
1972,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Me to thy will! Desist (thou art discerned,"
1973,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And toil’st in vain), nor me in vain molest.”"
1974,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:—"
1975,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!     500"
1976,THE FOURTH BOOK,For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.
1977,THE FOURTH BOOK,Of the Messiah I have heard foretold
1978,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length"
1979,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew,"
1980,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field,"
1981,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born."
1982,THE FOURTH BOOK,From that time seldom have I ceased to eye
1983,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,"
1984,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;"
1985,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all     510"
1986,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest"
1987,THE FOURTH BOOK,"(Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven"
1988,THE FOURTH BOOK,Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.
1989,THE FOURTH BOOK,Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view
1990,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn"
1991,THE FOURTH BOOK,In what degree or meaning thou art called
1992,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Son of God, which bears no single sense."
1993,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Son of God I also am, or was;"
1994,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And, if I was, I am; relation stands:"
1995,THE FOURTH BOOK,All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought     520
1996,THE FOURTH BOOK,In some respect far higher so declared.
1997,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,"
1998,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And followed thee still on to this waste wild,"
1999,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Where, by all best conjectures, I collect"
2000,THE FOURTH BOOK,Thou art to be my fatal enemy.
2001,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek"
2002,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To understand my adversary, who"
2003,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent;"
2004,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By parle or composition, truce or league,"
2005,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To win him, or win from him what I can.     530"
2006,THE FOURTH BOOK,And opportunity I here have had
2007,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee"
2008,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Proof against all temptation, as a rock"
2009,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of adamant and as a centre, firm"
2010,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,"
2011,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,"
2012,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Have been before contemned, and may again."
2013,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,"
2014,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,"
2015,THE FOURTH BOOK,Another method I must now begin.”     540
2016,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing"
2017,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,"
2018,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Over the wilderness and o’er the plain,"
2019,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,"
2020,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Holy City, lifted high her towers,"
2021,THE FOURTH BOOK,And higher yet the glorious Temple reared
2022,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Her pile, far off appearing like a mount"
2023,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:"
2024,THE FOURTH BOOK,"There, on the highest pinnacle, he set"
2025,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:—     550"
2026,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright"
2027,THE FOURTH BOOK,Will ask thee skill. I to thy Father’s house
2028,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best."
2029,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand,"
2030,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Cast thyself down. Safely, if Son of God;"
2031,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For it is written, ‘He will give command"
2032,THE FOURTH BOOK,Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands
2033,THE FOURTH BOOK,"They shall uplift thee, lest at any time"
2034,THE FOURTH BOOK,Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.’”
2035,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To whom thus Jesus: “Also it is written,     560"
2036,THE FOURTH BOOK,"‘Tempt not the Lord thy God.’” He said, and stood;"
2037,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell."
2038,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As when Earth’s son, Antaeus (to compare"
2039,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove"
2040,THE FOURTH BOOK,"With Jove’s Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose,"
2041,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Receiving from his mother Earth new strength,"
2042,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined,"
2043,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Throttled at length in the air expired and fell,"
2044,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud,"
2045,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride     570"
2046,THE FOURTH BOOK,Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;
2047,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And, as that Theban monster that proposed"
2048,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured,"
2049,THE FOURTH BOOK,"That once found out and solved, for grief and spite"
2050,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,"
2051,THE FOURTH BOOK,"So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,"
2052,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought"
2053,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,"
2054,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,"
2055,THE FOURTH BOOK,Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.     580
2056,THE FOURTH BOOK,So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe
2057,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,"
2058,THE FOURTH BOOK,Who on their plumy vans received Him soft
2059,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From his uneasy station, and upbore,"
2060,THE FOURTH BOOK,"As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;"
2061,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Then, in a flowery valley, set him down"
2062,THE FOURTH BOOK,"On a green bank, and set before him spread"
2063,THE FOURTH BOOK,"A table of celestial food, divine"
2064,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,"
2065,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,     590"
2066,THE FOURTH BOOK,"That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired"
2067,THE FOURTH BOOK,"What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,"
2068,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires"
2069,THE FOURTH BOOK,Sung heavenly anthems of his victory
2070,THE FOURTH BOOK,Over temptation and the Tempter proud:—
2071,THE FOURTH BOOK,"“True Image of the Father, whether throned"
2072,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In the bosom of bliss, and light of light"
2073,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined"
2074,THE FOURTH BOOK,"In fleshly tabernacle and human form,"
2075,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Wandering the wilderness—whatever place,     600"
2076,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing"
2077,THE FOURTH BOOK,"The Son of God, with Godlike force endued"
2078,THE FOURTH BOOK,Against the attempter of thy Father’s throne
2079,THE FOURTH BOOK,And thief of Paradise! Him long of old
2080,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast"
2081,THE FOURTH BOOK,With all his army; now thou hast avenged
2082,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing"
2083,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,"
2084,THE FOURTH BOOK,And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.
2085,THE FOURTH BOOK,He never more henceforth will dare set foot     610
2086,THE FOURTH BOOK,In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.
2087,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,"
2088,THE FOURTH BOOK,A fairer Paradise is founded now
2089,THE FOURTH BOOK,"For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,"
2090,THE FOURTH BOOK,"A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;"
2091,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,"
2092,THE FOURTH BOOK,Of tempter and temptation without fear.
2093,THE FOURTH BOOK,"But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long"
2094,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Rule in the clouds. Like an autumnal star,"
2095,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down     620"
2096,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Under his feet. For proof, ere this thou feel’st"
2097,THE FOURTH BOOK,Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)
2098,THE FOURTH BOOK,"By this repulse received, and hold’st in Hell"
2099,THE FOURTH BOOK,No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues
2100,THE FOURTH BOOK,Thy bold attempt. Hereafter learn with awe
2101,THE FOURTH BOOK,"To dread the Son of God. He, all unarmed,"
2102,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,"
2103,THE FOURTH BOOK,"From thy demoniac holds, possession foul—"
2104,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,"
2105,THE FOURTH BOOK,"And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,     630"
2106,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Lest he command them down into the Deep,"
2107,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Bound, and to torment sent before their time."
2108,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,"
2109,THE FOURTH BOOK,Queller of Satan! On thy glorious work
2110,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Now enter, and begin to save Mankind.”"
2111,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,"
2112,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,"
2113,THE FOURTH BOOK,"Brought on his way with joy. He, unobserved,"
2114,THE FOURTH BOOK,Home to his mother’s house private returned.
