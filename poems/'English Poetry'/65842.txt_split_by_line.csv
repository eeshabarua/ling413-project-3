28,SONGS TO A WIFE,
29,SONGS TO A WIFE,_My love is beautiful and sweet; she is like a pale
30,SONGS TO A WIFE,pink rose full of the glory of dew and sun. Sharon’s
31,SONGS TO A WIFE,garden knows not a bloom so fair as she. Persia holds
32,SONGS TO A WIFE,not a fragrance so heavenly in its perfumed bowers.
33,SONGS TO A WIFE,"Oh, my wondrous love, pour thy scented charm into"
34,SONGS TO A WIFE,the chalice of my longing heart; fill with thy fresh
35,SONGS TO A WIFE,splendour the air I breathe; and give me youth to
36,SONGS TO A WIFE,"spend on thee, my well-beloved. I am the gardener,"
37,SONGS TO A WIFE,born to tend one flower. My flower is the radiance of
38,SONGS TO A WIFE,a dawn in June. Like a veil of glowing pearls my love
39,SONGS TO A WIFE,"spreads her light; she is my morning, my joy of perfect"
40,SONGS TO A WIFE,hours. I will sing to her the song fresh roses raise
41,SONGS TO A WIFE,from their delicious petals when night departs and
42,SONGS TO A WIFE,"they rejoice, sun-kissed, when all the east is rich in"
43,SONGS TO A WIFE,gold. Lovely is my bloom. Her soul is the first blossom
44,SONGS TO A WIFE,given by Him who made the loveliness of Spring._

56,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,
57,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"A pearl set in the hollow of a stone,"
58,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,Wrought deftly by an artist of great skill;
59,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,A sapphire ’twas that bore the pearl so still
60,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,Within its bosom; taking from its tone
61,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,
62,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,Those fires of deep delight to Asia known.
63,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"Blent in an amethyst, the priceless twain"
64,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"Enthronèd were, o’er glowing worlds to reign,"
65,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,In gladness richer than the morn has shown.
66,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,
67,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"She, like a regal lily of the field,"
68,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"On which the sunset colours softly lay,"
69,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,Forgot that life was sometime dark and sad;
70,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"She smiled, and bade all sorrow’s wounds be healed;"
71,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,Then she was lovelier than heav’n’s best day--
72,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,"Ethereal, in blue and purple clad."
73,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,
74,IN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD,

78,FAR HORIZONS,
79,FAR HORIZONS,
80,FAR HORIZONS,"We stand upon the barren shore,"
81,FAR HORIZONS,"And look far out to sea,"
82,FAR HORIZONS,The crooning waves their burden pour
83,FAR HORIZONS,On you and me.
84,FAR HORIZONS,
85,FAR HORIZONS,"Our longing eyes, full of our mind,"
86,FAR HORIZONS,On far horizons lie--
87,FAR HORIZONS,"There, where our joy we hope to find"
88,FAR HORIZONS,Before we die.
89,FAR HORIZONS,
90,FAR HORIZONS,How fair the tempting journey seems--
91,FAR HORIZONS,Smooth lake of mystery--
92,FAR HORIZONS,"How frail the craft, our forethought deems,"
93,FAR HORIZONS,For such a sea!
94,FAR HORIZONS,
95,FAR HORIZONS,"For you and me, my lovely one,"
96,FAR HORIZONS,And all our mighty hopes;
97,FAR HORIZONS,"One step, dear love, and we have done,"
98,FAR HORIZONS,And--cut the ropes?
99,FAR HORIZONS,
100,FAR HORIZONS,"Lashed to the past we stand, and fear"
101,FAR HORIZONS,To leave our ties and pain;
102,FAR HORIZONS,"Though (speaks the soul, if we would hear)"
103,FAR HORIZONS,Our loss is gain.
104,FAR HORIZONS,
105,FAR HORIZONS,"Fear blurs the vision of our dream,"
106,FAR HORIZONS,"Fear fills our hearts with dread,"
107,FAR HORIZONS,Soon we shall find upon life’s stream
108,FAR HORIZONS,Our souls are dead.
109,FAR HORIZONS,
110,FAR HORIZONS,We stand upon the shore and mourn;
111,FAR HORIZONS,"We grieve, despairingly,"
112,FAR HORIZONS,To leave the fetters we have borne--
113,FAR HORIZONS,So patiently.
114,FAR HORIZONS,
115,FAR HORIZONS,"Or, do we grieve that we are weak,"
116,FAR HORIZONS,"Lack courage to be free,"
117,FAR HORIZONS,And spurn the liberty we seek
118,FAR HORIZONS,For slavery?
119,FAR HORIZONS,
120,FAR HORIZONS,Doubts lie--like pebbles on this strand--
121,FAR HORIZONS,"In our sad souls, my mate."
122,FAR HORIZONS,"Before us lies the promised land,"
123,FAR HORIZONS,Behind us--fate.
124,FAR HORIZONS,
125,FAR HORIZONS,"Then, let us here together bide,"
126,FAR HORIZONS,"With faces toward the sea,"
127,FAR HORIZONS,And hope that some fair morning’s tide
128,FAR HORIZONS,Take you and me.

142,HEBE’S EYES,
143,HEBE’S EYES,Ethereal are the hues
144,HEBE’S EYES,Where birds a-wing would lose
145,HEBE’S EYES,Themselves in heavenly bliss;
146,HEBE’S EYES,As I would do--
147,HEBE’S EYES,If I might soar to kiss

193,TWO FLOWERS,
194,TWO FLOWERS,I saw her face
195,TWO FLOWERS,When she bent down
196,TWO FLOWERS,And kissed the bloom. Then grace

207,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,"The soft night, like a silent child"
208,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,"Before some wondrous thing,"
209,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,"Withholds its breath, as if beguiled"

211,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,
212,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,"It seems to stand and listen, still"
213,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,As statue in a grove--
214,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,Perhaps it hears a fairy trill
215,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,A strain Titania wove.
216,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,
217,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,"Ah, no, the night hears not her song,"
218,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,For it would then be glad;
219,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,"And I have listened here so long,"
220,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,I know the night is sad.
221,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,
222,THE MUSIC OF MY HEART,Now if it be a song that keep

231,THE TRYST,
232,THE TRYST,
233,THE TRYST,My love is coming through green fields to me--
234,THE TRYST,Why does she tarry so?
235,THE TRYST,"She knows I wait on cliffs above the sea,"
236,THE TRYST,And dare not to her go;
237,THE TRYST,For I am prisoned to the spot where love
238,THE TRYST,"Has chained my feet, and must not call or move."
239,THE TRYST,
240,THE TRYST,"My love is gath’ring harebells, where the mead"
241,THE TRYST,Is starred with flowers to kiss
242,THE TRYST,"Her ling’ring feet; there sedges intercede,"
243,THE TRYST,And whisper runes of bliss--
244,THE TRYST,Beseeching her to stay and heed me not--
245,THE TRYST,For she can make a heaven of any spot!
246,THE TRYST,
247,THE TRYST,"My love is list’ning to the skylark’s song,"
248,THE TRYST,Delight is in her ears.
249,THE TRYST,"She cannot know her lover yearns so long,"
250,THE TRYST,And drinks his salty tears
251,THE TRYST,To quench his thirst for all her winsome grace--
252,THE TRYST,Her absence makes a desert of the place.
253,THE TRYST,
254,THE TRYST,My love is drinking in the air which blows
255,THE TRYST,"The perfumes of the sea,"
256,THE TRYST,The journeying breeze wafts past me--well she knows--
257,THE TRYST,Though me she cannot see!
258,THE TRYST,
259,THE TRYST,"Her lovely eyes, the yearning west would woo,"
260,THE TRYST,Look not on me while blooms in green fields sue.
261,THE TRYST,
262,THE TRYST,"She knows ’tis deathless love that holds me fast,"
263,THE TRYST,Chained to this rock so grim;
264,THE TRYST,"That I shall wait for her, until the last"
265,THE TRYST,Sun sets o’er ocean’s rim.
266,THE TRYST,"That flowers shall die and green fields fade and sear,"
267,THE TRYST,Ere I forsake the tryst to greet her here.

273,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
274,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
275,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Yes, everywhere I go"
276,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,I see the constant flow
277,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Of nature’s loveliness--
278,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"But, oh, if I could see"
279,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"These scenes, my love, with thee,"
280,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,How bright would be their dress!
281,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
282,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,I can no more rejoice
283,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Without your gracious voice
284,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Exulting in my ear,"
285,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"And nature, too, requires"
286,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Your soulful, ardent fires,"
287,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,To beautify the year.
288,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
289,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,The tender blooms turn pale
290,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"When I, alone, through vale"
291,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"And gully, searching pass;"
292,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"They seem to say to me,"
293,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,“Where is your mate? for we
294,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Bloom only for your lass.”
295,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
296,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,My worship in the glen
297,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Goes up for naught, dear, when"
298,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,I stand alone in prayer;
299,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"The sea, the dunes, the trees,"
300,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Chide me, and every breeze"
301,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Sings lamentation there.
302,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
303,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"No, nothing in this world"
304,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Where gales and snows have whirled
305,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,A joyous tempest down--
306,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Which spread a carpet fine
307,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"For thee to tread, can shine"
308,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,As your belovèd crown.
309,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
310,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"They do not envy you,"
311,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"They love the sweet, the true--"
312,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,They know you are sincere
313,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,As morning’s spark of light
314,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"In dew orbs shining bright,"
315,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,When heaven is blue and clear.
316,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
317,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"They want your merry laugh,"
318,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Like rain for them to quaff;
319,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,They want to kiss your feet;
320,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,They want to see your eyes--
321,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Full glory of blue skies--
322,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,Your smile they yearn to greet.
323,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,
324,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Come to the woods, my own,"
325,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,With every blessing known
326,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"To man, which you can bring;"
327,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Here is your royal goal,"
328,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,"Come, with your joyous soul,"
329,NATURE’S LOVELINESS,And make all nature sing!

335,YOU,
336,YOU,
337,YOU,What is this mystery?
338,YOU,This subtle wonder--you?
339,YOU,"Which fills my soul with ecstasy,"
340,YOU,My eyes with dew?
341,YOU,"What are you, influence, so mild?"
342,YOU,As subtle as the air which sways
343,YOU,The stalwart pine. What child
344,YOU,Of nature are you?
345,YOU,Soul obeys your slightest motion.
346,YOU,Mind is set in deep commotion--
347,YOU,By your presence--
348,YOU,By your absence--
349,YOU,Being thrills beneath your glance!
350,YOU,A smile will all my thought enhance.
351,YOU,"Touch my lips, and every bliss"
352,YOU,Seeks heaven’s glory in a kiss!
353,YOU,"You! sweet influence, what art"
354,YOU,God used in fashioning you apart
355,YOU,"From His renownèd mould,"
356,YOU,In the marvellous days of old?
357,YOU,"Why, all the elements combined"
358,YOU,In making you
359,YOU,"The dearest mystery refined,"
360,YOU,The ages through!
361,YOU,"Yet, what are you? with power"
362,YOU,"So great to bind my will,"
363,YOU,Fast in strong chains each hour;
364,YOU,And every action fill
365,YOU,"With echoes of one name,"
366,YOU,Resounding in love’s hall of fame?
367,YOU,You! Unlike your kind--
368,YOU,An essence of God’s mind.
369,YOU,"An attribute of His deep joy,"
370,YOU,When in his toil of love
371,YOU,"He fashioned you without alloy,"
372,YOU,"The masterpiece to prove,"
373,YOU,With every splendid gift--replete.
374,YOU,You--complete!
375,YOU,"My earth, sky, sea, and air;"
376,YOU,"My fruit, flower, jewel rare;"
377,YOU,My every need of day and night--
378,YOU,"Sun, moon, stars, space; my soul’s delight!"
379,YOU,Your name whose syllables are wings
380,YOU,"Which waft me high,"
381,YOU,Above the fragrant air which brings
382,YOU,Faint eastern aromatics to the sky.
383,YOU,"Ever a mystery of art to be,"
384,YOU,A subtle influence subjecting me.
385,YOU,"Like, fair Hamadryad, created anew--"
386,YOU,"Ineffable, mystical, wonderful--you!"

393,THE LAST LIGHT,
394,THE LAST LIGHT,The foothills of Nebraska shine
395,THE LAST LIGHT,In a disc of sunset gold;
396,THE LAST LIGHT,The cornstalks glisten like pale wine--
397,THE LAST LIGHT,But the wind is bitter cold.
398,THE LAST LIGHT,
399,THE LAST LIGHT,"Around my love a radiance lies,"
400,THE LAST LIGHT,’Tis the glow of her soul’s sun;
401,THE LAST LIGHT,’Twill light a vision in my eyes--
402,THE LAST LIGHT,When the long day’s work is done.

407,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,WHEN YOU WERE BORN
408,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
409,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
410,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"Love stirred the spheres,"
411,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,The groves rang mirth--
412,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,There were no tears--
413,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,At my love’s birth!
414,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
415,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,A dancing star
416,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,In revel flashed;
417,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,Then leaped afar--
418,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,And earthward dashed.
419,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
420,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,In bliss it showered
421,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,A million joys--
422,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,Sweet wishes flowered
423,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,In girls and boys.
424,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
425,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"Then back it went,"
426,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"With soaring dance,"
427,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,And darkness rent
428,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,In merry prance.
429,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
430,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,The dawn’s grey spires
431,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"Cleft night’s blue deep,"
432,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,Then golden fires
433,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,Consumed dawn’s keep.
434,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
435,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,A lark then flew
436,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,With joy on high--
437,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,With pearly dew--
438,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,Up to the sky.
439,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
440,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,And gave its kiss
441,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"To its dear mate,"
442,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"In flutt’ring bliss,"
443,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,At heaven’s gate.
444,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
445,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,So rosy morn
446,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"Subdued the night,"
447,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,"When you were born,"
448,WHEN YOU WERE BORN,My joy’s delight!

453,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED","FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED"
454,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",
455,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",
456,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED","Fortune, you have naught I need;"
457,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",Fame cannot appease me;
458,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",Flowery beds grow but a weed;
459,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",Laughter cannot please me.
460,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED","Lovely roses win no smile,"
461,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",From my drooping spirit;
462,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED","Larks a song may sing the while,"
463,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",I will never hear it.
464,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED","Music rich, on which I throve,"
465,"FORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED",Leaves me worn and weary;

954,THE DREAM,
955,THE DREAM,
956,THE DREAM,"Beauty waking from a vivid dream,"
957,THE DREAM,"All warm, and soft, and tender,"
958,THE DREAM,Her eyes with happiness agleam--
959,THE DREAM,"Outstretched her arms, so slender."
960,THE DREAM,Her face a picture full of wonder--
961,THE DREAM,Her lips of gushing love asunder.
962,THE DREAM,"My lovely mistress, then ensouled,"
963,THE DREAM,"Wrapped in the gown of rosy sleep,"
964,THE DREAM,"Thrust back the curtained haze, and rolled"
965,THE DREAM,Aside the mists of slumber deep.
966,THE DREAM,
967,THE DREAM,"Sweetly she murmured to her lover: “Boy,"
968,THE DREAM,I dreamed a dream all joy!
969,THE DREAM,"There, in a thicket, caught by thorns,"
970,THE DREAM,"A bird, which morning’s glow adorns,"
971,THE DREAM,"(It was not hurt, but tangled there,"
972,THE DREAM,And struggled to be free)
973,THE DREAM,A yellow bright canary!
974,THE DREAM,It whistled sweet to me--
975,THE DREAM,I thought it was a fairy.
976,THE DREAM,"In golden robes so rare,"
977,THE DREAM,"Until I stretched my hand,"
978,THE DREAM,And saw it spread its wings.
979,THE DREAM,"Then, not in fairyland,"
980,THE DREAM,I thought an elf (though each one sings)
981,THE DREAM,"Could thrill so blithe a song,"
982,THE DREAM,Or fly away so fast.
983,THE DREAM,"I gave it liberty,"
984,THE DREAM,"To live a life of joys both bright and long,"
985,THE DREAM,In one warm summer of days unsurpassed.
986,THE DREAM,This dream of freedom came to me.”
987,THE DREAM,
988,THE DREAM,"Joy tinted every feature of her face,"
989,THE DREAM,Warm blushes spread beneath the lace
990,THE DREAM,"Of her fine robe, and pure delight"
991,THE DREAM,Sang in the phrases of her speech;
992,THE DREAM,"She lay, and told the story bright"
993,THE DREAM,"In throbbing tones of happiness,"
994,THE DREAM,"So wonderful was she, I would beseech"
995,THE DREAM,Such exquisite dear tenderness--
996,THE DREAM,Soft as the morning sun’s serenest beams--
997,THE DREAM,"Would come from all her dreams,"
998,THE DREAM,"And make my love so rosy,"
999,THE DREAM,"So warm, so soft and cosy;"
1000,THE DREAM,"So clinging in her kisses,"
1001,THE DREAM,Resplendent in those blisses
1002,THE DREAM,"Of trust, and hope, and courage fine,"
1003,THE DREAM,Which shone in her like gleams of deep red wine!
1004,THE DREAM,"My soul was never thrilled,"
1005,THE DREAM,As it was then by her;
1006,THE DREAM,"My eyes with tears were filled,"
1007,THE DREAM,For joys so rare!
1008,THE DREAM,"Love surged like a sun-shaft up,"
1009,THE DREAM,To drink deep bliss from heaven’s cup!
1010,THE DREAM,"’Twas like the poet’s joy I feel,"
1011,THE DREAM,"As if her lovely soul were bare,"
1012,THE DREAM,And mine with it was there
1013,THE DREAM,To touch and heal
1014,THE DREAM,"Itself, and all those blessings gain"
1015,THE DREAM,"Which God sends down on her like sweet, refreshing rain."
1016,THE DREAM,
1017,THE DREAM,"Blest be her gracious head,"
1018,THE DREAM,Smooth be her smiling brow!
1019,THE DREAM,May Spring and Summer wed
1020,THE DREAM,"For Hebe now,"
1021,THE DREAM,And shower--
1022,THE DREAM,Aye! every hour--
1023,THE DREAM,The fairest blossoms of the trees
1024,THE DREAM,"On every fragrant gentle breeze,"
1025,THE DREAM,"To make soft paths for her dear feet,"
1026,THE DREAM,When she would in her sweet dreams greet
1027,THE DREAM,"Her fond, adoring mate,"
1028,THE DREAM,At dreamland’s gate.

1040,THE BOON,Is there some precious thing for its own sake
1041,THE BOON,My mind doth crave to make it strong and glow?
1042,THE BOON,"Is there some priceless treasure I might show,"
1043,THE BOON,And make men from their rosy dreams awake?
1044,THE BOON,
1045,THE BOON,No treasure this deep world can give I need.
1046,THE BOON,My dearest wish no mighty king can give;
1047,THE BOON,My great desire--no bauble that will cloy!
1048,THE BOON,I seek no gains on which ambitions feed!

1065,JACK O’LANTERN,You will not leave me now you do invoke
1066,JACK O’LANTERN,"My thought to that dear night, long gone, when she,"
1067,JACK O’LANTERN,"With elfin joy, went out and captured thee."
1068,JACK O’LANTERN,
1069,JACK O’LANTERN,"You circle round my head, a band of flame--"
1070,JACK O’LANTERN,A light that fades as quickly as it came.
1071,JACK O’LANTERN,"O fickle fly, deny me not, come burn"
1072,JACK O’LANTERN,"For me, and let me from this torture turn;"
1073,JACK O’LANTERN,In recollection’s refuge seek relief
1074,JACK O’LANTERN,"From loneliness, the torn soul’s awful grief."
1075,JACK O’LANTERN,"Come, bright or dark, do you but circle near,"
1076,JACK O’LANTERN,Where you alone in night my words may hear.
1077,JACK O’LANTERN,
1078,JACK O’LANTERN,"What of my love? My wondrous love, who caught"
1079,JACK O’LANTERN,"You winging that sweet night, as swift as thought,"
1080,JACK O’LANTERN,"And threw you on the logs to start the fire,"
1081,JACK O’LANTERN,Whose gleams revealed to me my heart’s desire?
1082,JACK O’LANTERN,Matchless! all in her loveliness and grace--
1083,JACK O’LANTERN,"Soft as her humour, happy as her face."
1084,JACK O’LANTERN,
1085,JACK O’LANTERN,"Where is she now? Oh, where is my lost love,"
1086,JACK O’LANTERN,"My fairy mistress, gentle as a dove?"
1087,JACK O’LANTERN,"Does she in cockle leaves hide long night through,"
1088,JACK O’LANTERN,"Fearful of the clouds, shrinking from the dew?"
1089,JACK O’LANTERN,I never see her now! The fire no more
1090,JACK O’LANTERN,In flick’ring rays lights up my sad heart’s core.
1091,JACK O’LANTERN,There is no warmth in life now she is gone.
1092,JACK O’LANTERN,The sun disdains the man it shines upon.
1093,JACK O’LANTERN,"A wretched thing, bereft of all his joy,"
1094,JACK O’LANTERN,"Goes wand’ring through the night, where fays employ"
1095,JACK O’LANTERN,"The hours in dirges drear, and weirdly mourn"
1096,JACK O’LANTERN,"For her, their queen, long lost to fairy bourn."
1097,JACK O’LANTERN,

1101,JACK O’LANTERN,She whose dear radiance makes my perfect day!
1102,JACK O’LANTERN,"Alas! you heed me not, your lamp is out,"
1103,JACK O’LANTERN,"You hide away in darkness, black as doubt,"
1104,JACK O’LANTERN,"You light, to mock the faithful, false as hell,"
1105,JACK O’LANTERN,"You, in and out, you phosphorescent sell--"
1106,JACK O’LANTERN,"I will have naught to do with you. Go, shine,"
1107,JACK O’LANTERN,And make a fool of souls less tough than mine.
1108,JACK O’LANTERN,
1109,JACK O’LANTERN,"A weary round is day, and night is torn"
1110,JACK O’LANTERN,By all the bitter conflicts day has worn;
1111,JACK O’LANTERN,"The hours are full of shattered hopes, and pass"
1112,JACK O’LANTERN,"With ling’ring tortures, writhing in the mass"
1113,JACK O’LANTERN,"Of gloomy moods. I am no man of day,"
1114,JACK O’LANTERN,Nor am I one the limpid night’s soft ray
1115,JACK O’LANTERN,Will fall upon to bless. No hour will claim
1116,JACK O’LANTERN,"Me for time’s old companion. Yes, I shame"
1117,JACK O’LANTERN,"The ordinance of day, bright hours or dark,"
1118,JACK O’LANTERN,One out of joint with all. The happy lark
1119,JACK O’LANTERN,Sings now no more for me. The flow’ring dell
1120,JACK O’LANTERN,No longer blooms as she with cup and bell
1121,JACK O’LANTERN,"Once did. For there is gone from out my life,"
1122,JACK O’LANTERN,"My matchless queen, my joy, my fairy wife."
1123,JACK O’LANTERN,
1124,JACK O’LANTERN,"You gleam no more, and yet on wing you roam,"
1125,JACK O’LANTERN,"A firefly desolate, bereft of home"
1126,JACK O’LANTERN,"And hearth, where logs might burn and shine at night,"
1127,JACK O’LANTERN,"Upon the sweetest elf that did delight,"
1128,JACK O’LANTERN,"Beyond excelling, mortal soul and mind."
1129,JACK O’LANTERN,"May you, poor, searching, Jack O’Lantern, find"
1130,JACK O’LANTERN,The mistress of your fairy world in state.
1131,JACK O’LANTERN,"Then come, and take me to the shining grate,"

1195,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,There is a sneer about your lips--
1196,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"A moth is near them--see! it sips,"
1197,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,And now rejoicing takes to flight.
1198,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Oh moth, I envy you that kiss;"
1199,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,My lips are arid strangers now.
1200,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Oh, I would take to flight, I vow,"
1201,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,If I could revel in such bliss.
1202,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Why do you look at me and frown?
1203,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,What have I done but love you well?
1204,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Does she love me? Come, picture, tell--"
1205,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"The moth returns, and flutters down"
1206,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Upon that blessed wavy hair.
1207,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Oh, how I love each scented strand!"
1208,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,How oft my lips would make a band
1209,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"To capture in a kiss, ensnare"
1210,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,A lock of that dear crown of yours!
1211,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Ah, well, be vexed with me, severe."
1212,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Those eyes have never shed a tear;
1213,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"They follow me on restless tours,"
1214,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"While I the night pace to and fro,"
1215,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Hour after hour, to pass away"
1216,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,The dreary time before the day.
1217,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Your eyes upon these journeys go,"
1218,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Watching, sternly. Picture, tell me--"
1219,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,What sphinx are you? Speak once and show
1220,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Some sign of pleasure. Let me know
1221,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,If you would from my company
1222,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Be gone, and choose another one"
1223,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"To be with you each day, each hour;"
1224,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Resting only--then in my power--
1225,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,When from the villages I run?
1226,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Then cosily you rest between
1227,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,The folds of my best coat--from grime
1228,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,And soot set free. At evening time
1229,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Alone I leave you here. How mean
1230,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Of you to be so petulant!
1231,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Not once of late have you beguiled
1232,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,A moody hour of mine and smiled.
1233,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"If I have sinned, it was not meant."

1235,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"See, I will coax a smile--I’ll set"
1236,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,You this way--that way--no smile yet?
1237,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Just for a moment! Please unbend.
1238,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Then I shall turn you now oblique--
1239,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Ah! what a change! Your eyes are quite
1240,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Like hers--they hold the heavens so bright--
1241,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Those stars my lonely soul would seek.
1242,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"I nearly called you Hebe, then--"
1243,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"You were so like, for just a span,"
1244,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,As o’er your brow vibrations ran.
1245,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"So they oft do o’er Hebe’s, when"
1246,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Some mischief, brewing in her mind,"
1247,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Sends laughter ripples o’er her skin--
1248,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Her mirth will out when mischief’s in.
1249,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Where might you her resemblance find?
1250,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Her laughter is a wondrous sound--
1251,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Sorrow, sadness, find their level."
1252,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Where do joy and gladness revel?
1253,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Ah, where? Where Hebe can be found!"
1254,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,You know her not; yet you are she
1255,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Who made you negative. The match
1256,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Is sometimes perfect. Did you catch
1257,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Her glance when thoughts perhaps of me--
1258,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Alas! that could not be. She knew
1259,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Me not when you were fashioned, friend,"
1260,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,And never dreamed where you would wend
1261,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Mile after mile with me, to rue"
1262,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,The day when you were sent to hear
1263,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,A million questions. Pity you?
1264,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"I do! No woman, false or true,"
1265,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Is in listening long your peer!
1266,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Heavens! What have you heard me tell?
1267,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,What rapture have you witnessed--oft
1268,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Despair--at which you ever scoffed?
1269,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,The gamut--all from heaven to hell--
1270,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,All passion’s swift vagaries seen--
1271,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"My longing, pleading, anxious nights,"
1272,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,And day’s distracted hours. What fights
1273,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"With self, with selfishness between!"
1274,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Have you seen all, heard all, known all?"
1275,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Then you must be the wisest sphinx
1276,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,That wisdom new and ancient links.
1277,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,But you are silent as a wall
1278,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Without a mark. So should it be.
1279,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,For she must never know what I
1280,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,When all alone go through.
1281,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Now lie
1282,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Down flat--there! Let me once more see
1283,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"Into your eyes, ere to that shore--"
1284,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,Where sleep may be--I go tonight
1285,TO A PHOTOGRAPH,"With thoughts of her, my joy’s delight,"

1367,ALONE,Henceforward be reviled.
1368,ALONE,Work? Where? Not here! Within these walls?
1369,ALONE,"Work! What? Come, try it now,"
1370,ALONE,And answer every thought that calls
1371,ALONE,In every moment. Tell me how
1372,ALONE,"One single minute, pray,"
1373,ALONE,My mind can get away
1374,ALONE,"From her, the absent one--"
1375,ALONE,"Come, tell me, and my work is done."
1376,ALONE,
1377,ALONE,The air! Go out and roam the field.
1378,ALONE,Sit in the sun--or rain;
1379,ALONE,Or count the stars again;
1380,ALONE,Or tell the steps long footsore journeys have revealed.
1381,ALONE,Do something. Go! But what?
1382,ALONE,"What, leave that thought behind?"
1383,ALONE,Where go? Where that is not
1384,ALONE,The burden of my mind?
1385,ALONE,
1386,ALONE,"Forget. Why, all the fiends of midnight hours"
1387,ALONE,Yell that drab word at me; it falls in showers
1388,ALONE,"Of rattling drops,"
1389,ALONE,"And never stops,"
1390,ALONE,Until my ears
1391,ALONE,"Nigh burst,"
1392,ALONE,And I accurst
1393,ALONE,With all Hell’s fears!
1394,ALONE,
1395,ALONE,Still there are moments when
1396,ALONE,"Relief comes to my ken,"
1397,ALONE,Then I admire my torturer sublime.
1398,ALONE,The silence of her absence is like time
1399,ALONE,A million years beyond this day--
1400,ALONE,"Like stillness of forgotten tombs,"
1401,ALONE,"Where Nineveh, once gay,"
1402,ALONE,"Stood mighty, where now the sandstorm booms"
1403,ALONE,O’er a desert quite as lonely as my heart.
1404,ALONE,"She leaves me, like a queen, to bear the smart"
1405,ALONE,Of her superb indifference and calm--
1406,ALONE,Unconscious of the harm
1407,ALONE,Such loneliness can do!
1408,ALONE,
1409,ALONE,The day when it is new
1410,ALONE,Dawns dark and drear.
1411,ALONE,Each hour a bier
1412,ALONE,"On which I lay my thought,"
1413,ALONE,And see it come to life again--
1414,ALONE,"Reincarnated spirit, caught"
1415,ALONE,"Back, to murder it in agony, and then--"
1416,ALONE,"The weary strife goes on and on,"
1417,ALONE,"The minutes reek with blood,"
1418,ALONE,And then the fiends of loneliness soon don
1419,ALONE,"The inky cloak with scarlet hood,"
1420,ALONE,"And round me chant their racking dirges chill,"
1421,ALONE,And bring their terrors on to slay my will.
1422,ALONE,
1423,ALONE,"First, slimy, drooling Jealousy appears--"
1424,ALONE,A female draped in timid lover’s fears--
1425,ALONE,"She minces, ambles, leers at me,"
1426,ALONE,"And whispers tales, maliciously."
1427,ALONE,"The spume of Hell’s presumption she,"
1428,ALONE,The horror of the lonely. See!
1429,ALONE,How she begins her work--
1430,ALONE,The craft! the skill!
1431,ALONE,It enters like a dirk--
1432,ALONE,The soul to kill.
1433,ALONE,
1434,ALONE,"She fails, and vanishes in mist."
1435,ALONE,"My soul is adamant, and will resist."
1436,ALONE,"Then Poison comes, in silvery sheen,"
1437,ALONE,The figure holds a cup between
1438,ALONE,"The palms of outstretched hands,"
1439,ALONE,"And in a pleasant tone commands me, “Drink!"
1440,ALONE,And no more think.
1441,ALONE,Why suffer earth’s delirious pain?
1442,ALONE,The yearning heart that yearns in vain
1443,ALONE,Will know no peace until the light
1444,ALONE,Goes out in never-ending night.
1445,ALONE,I bring you here the only balm
1446,ALONE,"For loneliness. Drink, and be calm!"
1447,ALONE,Where all is still no aching mind
1448,ALONE,Can harrow you--peace you will find.”
1449,ALONE,Then Poison hies away;
1450,ALONE,To tempt me when despair
1451,ALONE,"May crush me some dread day,"
1452,ALONE,And I no longer care!
1453,ALONE,
1454,ALONE,"They fail to find me apt,"
1455,ALONE,So on comes License garbed
1456,ALONE,"In golden lace, and wrapped"
1457,ALONE,About her waist a serpent barbed.
1458,ALONE,Hell’s finest figure walks
1459,ALONE,With dignity and grace;
1460,ALONE,"Beseechingly she talks,"
1461,ALONE,And modest is her face.
1462,ALONE,The fiends do well. They know
1463,ALONE,The jade
1464,ALONE,"Must masquerade,"
1465,ALONE,"Seem innocence, aglow,"
1466,ALONE,My loneliness to break and then beguile!
1467,ALONE,The trick is hardly worth a smile.
1468,ALONE,Still I am left alone
1469,ALONE,To wrestle with the spawn
1470,ALONE,That comes from Hell to fawn
1471,ALONE,On me. Can soul atone
1472,ALONE,"For this one cruel act of thine,"
1473,ALONE,"My torturer, divine?"
1474,ALONE,Can thoughts so merciless afflict
1475,ALONE,The mind and leave it sane?
1476,ALONE,"Or bubbles burst, when they are pricked,"
1477,ALONE,And seem the same again?
1478,ALONE,"The weariness of longing and its woe,"
1479,ALONE,"The evil thoughts drear loneliness will sow,"
1480,ALONE,"The torrid tears,"
1481,ALONE,"Abhorrent fears,"
1482,ALONE,"The fretful waiting,"
1483,ALONE,The frenzied hating;
1484,ALONE,"All come to me, by night, by day,"
1485,ALONE,When you are far away.

1500,ROAMING,"Must I go roaming on unblest,"
1501,ROAMING,Without a chart or goal?
1502,ROAMING,
1503,ROAMING,Go searching for a place where peace
1504,ROAMING,May soothe away my pain;
1505,ROAMING,"Some lonely nook where ills may cease,"
1506,ROAMING,And nothing be all gain?
1507,ROAMING,
1508,ROAMING,"And yet, with all the pain and tears,"
1509,ROAMING,That lonely sorrows bring;
1510,ROAMING,"Though life’s besetting woes are fears,"
1511,ROAMING,To hope’s frail staff I cling.
1512,ROAMING,
1513,ROAMING,"My fears are hopes in joy’s disguise,"
1514,ROAMING,"My hopes are fears in flight,"
1515,ROAMING,"Which seek an earthly paradise,"
1516,ROAMING,Beyond the range of sight.
1517,ROAMING,
1518,ROAMING,"So nestle, pain, you constant friend,"
1519,ROAMING,Close to my longing heart--
1520,ROAMING,What matter how the story end--
1521,ROAMING,We two shall never part.
1522,ROAMING,
1523,ROAMING,"And yet there is a place I know,"
1524,ROAMING,Where all griefs are forgot--
1525,ROAMING,"A breast to which I ever go,"
1526,ROAMING,E’en knowing it is not.
1527,ROAMING,
1528,ROAMING,I go to that dear place to lose
1529,ROAMING,"All fears, all woes, all pains;"
1530,ROAMING,"It is the paradise I choose,"
1531,ROAMING,Where life eternal reigns!
1532,ROAMING,
1533,ROAMING,"Where life is drawn anew from springs,"
1534,ROAMING,"Which flow with every bliss,"
1535,ROAMING,And to me joy celestial brings
1536,ROAMING,New hope with every kiss!
1537,ROAMING,
1538,ROAMING,"Alas, the breast of love is wide,"
1539,ROAMING,"Too precious for one life,"
1540,ROAMING,And others cannot be denied--
1541,ROAMING,For what is love but strife?
1542,ROAMING,
1543,ROAMING,"So, ever seeking, trudge and roam,"
1544,ROAMING,"Through hours of chill and gloom,"
1545,ROAMING,"And make the silent night your home,"
1546,ROAMING,Where there is always room.
1547,ROAMING,
1548,ROAMING,"Roam on, until a morn shall rise,"
1549,ROAMING,"When you will wake from rest,"

1562,STORM,Love without grief no test of strength will prove.
1563,STORM,"The bitterness and pain, dread loneliness,"
1564,STORM,"The ache of yearning, then the galling thought--"
1565,STORM,"Love’s deep passions in shattering gusts are caught,"
1566,STORM,And scattered wide apart when deep distress
1567,STORM,Comes raging through the soul’s wide-open door;

1569,STORM,Where all the dearest joys take refuge in--
1570,STORM,"Searching the battered frame to find its core,"
