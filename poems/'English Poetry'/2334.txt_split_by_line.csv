835,A CODE OF MORALS,Lest you should think this story true
836,A CODE OF MORALS,I merely mention I
837,A CODE OF MORALS,Evolved it lately. 'Tis a most
838,A CODE OF MORALS,Unmitigated misstatement.
839,A CODE OF MORALS,
840,A CODE OF MORALS,"Now Jones had left his new-wed bride to keep his house in order,"
841,A CODE OF MORALS,"And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border,"
842,A CODE OF MORALS,To sit on a rock with a heliograph; but ere he left he taught
843,A CODE OF MORALS,His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught.
844,A CODE OF MORALS,
845,A CODE OF MORALS,"And Love had made him very sage, as Nature made her fair;"
846,A CODE OF MORALS,"So Cupid and Apollo linked, per heliograph, the pair."
847,A CODE OF MORALS,"At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise--"
848,A CODE OF MORALS,"At e'en, the dying sunset bore her husband's homilies."
849,A CODE OF MORALS,
850,A CODE OF MORALS,"He warned her 'gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold,"
851,A CODE OF MORALS,As much as 'gainst the blandishments paternal of the old;
852,A CODE OF MORALS,But kept his gravest warnings for (hereby the ditty hangs)
853,A CODE OF MORALS,"That snowy-haired Lothario, Lieutenant-General Bangs."
854,A CODE OF MORALS,
855,A CODE OF MORALS,"'Twas General Bangs, with Aide and Staff, who tittupped on the way,"
856,A CODE OF MORALS,When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play.
857,A CODE OF MORALS,"They thought of Border risings, and of stations sacked and burnt--"
858,A CODE OF MORALS,So stopped to take the message down--and this is what they learnt--
859,A CODE OF MORALS,
860,A CODE OF MORALS,"""Dash dot dot, dot, dot dash, dot dash dot"" twice. The General swore."
861,A CODE OF MORALS,
862,A CODE OF MORALS,"""Was ever General Officer addressed as 'dear' before?"
863,A CODE OF MORALS,"""'My Love,' i' faith! 'My Duck,' Gadzooks! 'My darling popsy-wop!'"
864,A CODE OF MORALS,"""Spirit of great Lord Wolseley, who is on that mountaintop?"""
865,A CODE OF MORALS,
866,A CODE OF MORALS,"The artless Aide-de-camp was mute; the gilded Staff were still,"
867,A CODE OF MORALS,"As, dumb with pent-up mirth, they booked that message from the hill;"
868,A CODE OF MORALS,"For clear as summer lightning-flare, the husband's warning ran:--"
869,A CODE OF MORALS,"""Don't dance or ride with General Bangs--a most immoral man."""
870,A CODE OF MORALS,
871,A CODE OF MORALS,"[At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise--"
872,A CODE OF MORALS,"But, howsoever Love be blind, the world at large hath eyes.]"
873,A CODE OF MORALS,With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife
874,A CODE OF MORALS,Some interesting details of the General's private life.
875,A CODE OF MORALS,
876,A CODE OF MORALS,"The artless Aide-de-camp was mute, the shining Staff were still,"
877,A CODE OF MORALS,And red and ever redder grew the General's shaven gill.
878,A CODE OF MORALS,
879,A CODE OF MORALS,And this is what he said at last (his feelings matter not):--
880,A CODE OF MORALS,"""I think we've tapped a private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!"""
881,A CODE OF MORALS,
882,A CODE OF MORALS,"All honour unto Bangs, for ne'er did Jones thereafter know"
883,A CODE OF MORALS,By word or act official who read off that helio.
884,A CODE OF MORALS,
885,A CODE OF MORALS,"But the tale is on the Frontier, and from Michni to Mooltan"
886,A CODE OF MORALS,"They know the worthy General as ""that most immoral man."""

998,THE VAMPIRE,A fool there was and he made his prayer
999,THE VAMPIRE,(Even as you and I!)
1000,THE VAMPIRE,To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair
1001,THE VAMPIRE,"(We called her the woman who did not care),"

3084,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,tho' they come from the ends of the earth!
3085,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3086,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side,"
3087,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:
3088,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,"
3089,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away."
3090,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3091,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides:
3092,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?"""
3093,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar:"

3101,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,"
3102,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal's men.

3106,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,"
3107,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the gallows-

3109,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,

3114,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,"
3115,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,"
3116,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack."
3117,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3118,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide."
3119,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Ye shoot like a soldier,"" Kamal said.  ""Show now if ye can ride."""

3121,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dustdevils go,"
3122,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe."
3123,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3124,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,"
3125,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove."
3126,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3127,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,"
3128,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.
3129,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3130,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,"
3131,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn."
3132,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3133,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he fell at a water-course--in a woful heap fell he,"
3134,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free."
3135,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3136,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"He has knocked the pistol out of his hand--small room was there to strive,"
3137,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""'Twas only by favour of mine,"" quoth he, ""ye rode so long alive:"
3138,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,"
3139,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.
3140,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3141,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,"
3142,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:
3143,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,"
3144,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly."""
3145,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ""Do good to bird and beast,"
3146,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.
3147,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3148,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,"
3149,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.
3150,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3151,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered"
3152,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"grain,"

3154,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3155,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""But if thou thinkest the price be fair,--thy brethren wait to sup,"
3156,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn,--howl, dog, and call them up!"
3157,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,"
3158,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!"""
3159,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3160,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.
3161,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""No talk shall be of dogs,"" said he, ""when wolf and gray wolf meet."
3162,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3163,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;"
3164,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?"""
3165,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ""I hold by the blood of my clan:"
3166,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Take up the mare for my father's gift--by God, she has carried a man!"""
3167,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;"
3168,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""We be two strong men,"" said Kamal then, ""but she loveth the younger best."
3169,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3170,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,"
3171,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain."""
3172,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,"
3173,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Ye have taken the one from a foe,"" said he;"
3174,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""will ye take the mate from a friend?"""
3175,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""A gift for a gift,"" said Kamal straight; ""a limb for the risk of a limb."
3176,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3177,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!"""
3178,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest--"
3179,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest."
3180,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3181,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Now here is thy master,"" Kamal said, ""who leads a troop of the Guides,"
3182,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.
3183,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,"
3184,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Thy life is his--thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.
3185,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3186,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""So, thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,"
3187,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,"
3188,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power--
3189,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur."""
3190,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3191,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,"
3192,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:
3193,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,"
3194,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God."
3195,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3196,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,"
3197,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.
3198,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3199,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear--"
3200,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.
3201,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,
3202,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Ha' done! ha' done!"" said the Colonel's son."
3203,THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"""Put up the steel at your sides!"

3243,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3244,THE LAST SUTTEE,In the Golden room on the palace roof
3245,THE LAST SUTTEE,All night he fought for air:
3246,THE LAST SUTTEE,"And there was sobbing behind the screen,"

3248,THE LAST SUTTEE,And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen
3249,THE LAST SUTTEE,On the death she might not share.
3250,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3251,THE LAST SUTTEE,He passed at dawn--the death-fire leaped
3252,THE LAST SUTTEE,"From ridge to river-head,"
3253,THE LAST SUTTEE,From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars:
3254,THE LAST SUTTEE,And wail upon wail went up to the stars
3255,THE LAST SUTTEE,"Behind the grim zenana-bars,"
3256,THE LAST SUTTEE,When they knew that the King was dead.
3257,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3258,THE LAST SUTTEE,The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth
3259,THE LAST SUTTEE,And robe him for the pyre.
3260,THE LAST SUTTEE,The Boondi Queen beneath us cried:

3263,THE LAST SUTTEE,"Out, women!--to the fire!"""
3264,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3265,THE LAST SUTTEE,We drove the great gates home apace:
3266,THE LAST SUTTEE,White hands were on the sill:
3267,THE LAST SUTTEE,But ere the rush of the unseen feet
3268,THE LAST SUTTEE,"Had reached the turn to the open street,"
3269,THE LAST SUTTEE,"The bars shot down, the guard-drum beat--"
3270,THE LAST SUTTEE,We held the dovecot still.
3271,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3272,THE LAST SUTTEE,"A face looked down in the gathering day,"

3286,THE LAST SUTTEE,They knew that the King had spent his soul
3287,THE LAST SUTTEE,On a North-bred dancing-girl:
3288,THE LAST SUTTEE,"That he prayed to a flat-nosed Lucknow god,"
3289,THE LAST SUTTEE,"And kissed the ground where her feet had trod,"
3290,THE LAST SUTTEE,"And doomed to death at her drunken nod,"
3291,THE LAST SUTTEE,And swore by her lightest curl.
3292,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3293,THE LAST SUTTEE,"We bore the King to his fathers' place,"
3294,THE LAST SUTTEE,Where the tombs of the Sun-born stand:

3306,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3307,THE LAST SUTTEE,All night the red flame stabbed the sky
3308,THE LAST SUTTEE,With wavering wind-tossed spears:
3309,THE LAST SUTTEE,And out of a shattered temple crept
3310,THE LAST SUTTEE,"A woman who veiled her head and wept,"
3311,THE LAST SUTTEE,"And called on the King--but the great King slept,"
3312,THE LAST SUTTEE,And turned not for her tears.
3313,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3314,THE LAST SUTTEE,Small thought had he to mark the strife--
3315,THE LAST SUTTEE,Cold fear with hot desire--
3316,THE LAST SUTTEE,"When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame,"
3317,THE LAST SUTTEE,"And thrice she beat her breast for shame,"
3318,THE LAST SUTTEE,And thrice like a wounded dove she came
3319,THE LAST SUTTEE,And moaned about the fire.
3320,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3321,THE LAST SUTTEE,"One watched, a bow-shot from the blaze,"
3322,THE LAST SUTTEE,"The silent streets between,"
3323,THE LAST SUTTEE,"Who had stood by the King in sport and fray,"
3324,THE LAST SUTTEE,"To blade in ambush or boar at bay,"
3325,THE LAST SUTTEE,"And he was a baron old and gray,"

3327,THE LAST SUTTEE,
3328,THE LAST SUTTEE,"He said: ""O shameless, put aside"

4040,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay;"
4041,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye,"
4042,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby,"
4043,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall,"
4044,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And he was Captain of the Fleet--the bravest of them all.
4045,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4046,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the

4048,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer.
4049,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4050,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze,"
4051,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas.

4053,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled,"
4054,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.
4055,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4056,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""I ha' paid Port dues for your Law,"" quoth he, ""and where is the Law ye boast"
4057,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast?
4058,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk,"
4059,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk;
4060,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
4061,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre.
4062,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4063,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore,"

4066,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""He would not fly the Rovers' flag--the bloody or the black,"
4067,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack.
4068,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew--he swore it was only a loan;
4069,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own."
4070,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4071,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line,"
4072,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine;
4073,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas,"
4074,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He has taken my grinning heathen gods--and what should he want o' these?
4075,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"My foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats;"
4076,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats."

4078,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside,"
4079,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied.
4080,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4081,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm,"
4082,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm;
4083,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw,"
4084,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw;"
4085,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark,"
4086,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark;"
4087,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil,"
4088,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil;
4089,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side, and tasselled his beard i' the"

4091,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened

4093,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I had hove him down by the mangroves brown, where the mud-reef sucks and"

4095,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws!
4096,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow,"
4097,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"For he carries the taint of a musky ship--the reek of the slaver's dhow!"""
4098,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold,"
4099,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold,"
4100,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt:--
4101,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""Good Sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut."
4102,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4103,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus:"
4104,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us."
4105,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4106,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar--we know that his price is fair,"
4107,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre.
4108,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4109,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you,"
4110,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true."""
4111,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"The skipper called to the tall taffrail:--""And what is that to me?"
4112,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three?
4113,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line?
4114,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine.
4115,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4116,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in,"
4117,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"But we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin."
4118,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4119,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel?"
4120,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers? 'Fore Gad, then, why does he"

4122,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet,"
4123,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet.
4124,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4125,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began:--"
4126,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""We have heard a tale of a--foreign sail, but he is a merchantman."""
4127,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon:--
4128,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!"""
4129,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air:--
4130,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""We have sold our spars to the merchantman--we know that his price is fair."""
4131,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm:--"
4132,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm."""
4133,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"The halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad,"
4134,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord.
4135,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4136,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Masthead--masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the British craft;"
4137,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"The skipper called to his Lascar crew, and put her about and laughed:--"
4138,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""It's mainsail haul, my bully boys all--we'll out to the seas again--"
4139,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain."
4140,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4141,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""It's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea, and the swing of the unbought"
4142,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,brine--
4143,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,We'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o' the Line:
4144,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Till we come as a ship o' the Line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer,"
4145,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer;
4146,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty,"
4147,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea.
4148,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,
4149,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"""Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam--we stand on the outward tack,"
4150,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"We are paid in the coin of the white man's trade--the bezant is hard, ay, and"

5851,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5852,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,ONE of the few advantages that India has over England is a great
5853,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Knowability. After five years' service a man is directly or indirectly
5854,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"acquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province, all"
5855,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries, and some fifteen"
5856,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,hundred other people of the non-official caste. In ten years his
5857,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"knowledge should be doubled, and at the end of twenty he knows, or knows"
5858,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"something about, every Englishman in the Empire, and may travel anywhere"
5859,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and everywhere without paying hotel-bills.
5860,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5861,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Globe-trotters who expect entertainment as a right, have, even within my"
5862,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"memory, blunted this open-heartedness, but none the less today, if you"
5863,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"belong to the Inner Circle and are neither a Bear nor a Black Sheep,"
5864,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"all houses are open to you, and our small world is very, very kind and"
5865,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,helpful.
5866,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5867,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Rickett of Kamartha stayed with Polder of Kumaon some fifteen years ago.
5868,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"He meant to stay two nights, but was knocked down by rheumatic fever,"
5869,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"and for six weeks disorganized Polder's establishment, stopped Polder's"
5870,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"work, and nearly died in Polder's bedroom. Polder behaves as though he"
5871,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"had been placed under eternal obligation by Rickett, and yearly"
5872,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,sends the little Ricketts a box of presents and toys. It is the same
5873,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,everywhere. The men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you
5874,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"their opinion that you are an incompetent ass, and the women who blacken"
5875,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"your character and misunderstand your wife's amusements, will work"
5876,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious
5877,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,trouble.
5878,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5879,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Heatherlegh, the Doctor, kept, in addition to his regular practice,"
5880,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,a hospital on his private account--an arrangement of loose boxes for
5881,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Incurables, his friend called it--but it was really a sort of fitting-up"
5882,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather. The weather
5883,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed"
5884,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"quantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime"
5885,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"and get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as mixed as"
5886,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the metaphors in this sentence.
5887,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5888,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was, and his invariable"
5889,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"prescription to all his patients is, ""lie low, go slow, and keep cool."""
5890,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,He says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this
5891,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"world justifies. He maintains that overwork slew Pansay, who died under"
5892,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"his hands about three years ago. He has, of course, the right to speak"
5893,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"authoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack"
5894,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,in Pansay's head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and
5895,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"pressed him to death. ""Pansay went off the handle,"" says Heatherlegh,"
5896,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""after the stimulus of long leave at Home. He may or he may not have"
5897,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,behaved like a blackguard to Mrs. Keith-Wessington. My notion is that
5898,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the work of the Katabundi Settlement ran him off his legs, and that he"
5899,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,took to brooding and making much of an ordinary P. & 0. flirtation. He
5900,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"certainly was engaged to Miss Mannering, and she certainly broke off the"
5901,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,engagement. Then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about
5902,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ghosts developed. Overwork started his illness, kept it alight, and"
5903,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,killed him poor devil. Write him off to the System--one man to take the
5904,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"work of two and a half men."""
5905,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5906,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I do not believe this. I used to sit up with Pansay sometimes when
5907,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Heatherlegh was called out to patients, and I happened to be within"
5908,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"claim. The man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low, even"
5909,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"voice, the procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed."
5910,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,He had a sick man's command of language.
5911,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5912,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,When he recovered I suggested that he should write out the whole affair
5913,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"from beginning to end, knowing that ink might assist him to ease his"
5914,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,mind. When little boys have learned a new bad word they are never happy
5915,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,till they have chalked it up on a door. And this also is Literature.
5916,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5917,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"He was in a high fever while he was writing, and the blood-and-thunder"
5918,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Magazine diction he adopted did not calm him. Two months afterward
5919,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"he was reported fit for duty, but, in spite of the fact that he was"
5920,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,urgently needed to help an undermanned Commission stagger through a
5921,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"deficit, he preferred to die; vowing at the last that he was hag-ridden."
5922,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I got his manuscript before he died, and this is his version of the"
5923,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"affair, dated 1885:"
5924,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5925,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,My doctor tells me that I need rest and change of air. It is not
5926,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,improbable that I shall get both ere long--rest that neither the
5927,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"red-coated messenger nor the midday gun can break, and change of air"
5928,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,far beyond that which any homeward-bound steamer can give me. In the
5929,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"meantime I am resolved to stay where I am; and, in flat defiance of my"
5930,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"doctor's orders, to take all the world into my confidence. You shall"
5931,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady; and shall, too,"
5932,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth
5933,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was ever so tormented as I.

5936,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"drawn, my story, wild and hideously improbable as it may appear,"
5937,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,demands at least attention. That it will ever receive credence I utterly
5938,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,disbelieve. Two months ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man
5939,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,who had dared tell me the like. Two months ago I was the happiest man in
5940,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"India. Today, from Peshawur to the sea, there is no one more wretched."
5941,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"My doctor and I are the only two who know this. His explanation is, that"
5942,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"my brain, digestion, and eyesight are all slightly affected; giving rise"
5943,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"to my frequent and persistent ""delusions."" Delusions, indeed! I call him"
5944,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"a fool; but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile, the same"
5945,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"bland professional manner, the same neatly trimmed red whiskers, till I"
5946,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"begin to suspect that I am an ungrateful, evil-tempered invalid. But you"
5947,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,shall judge for yourselves.
5948,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5949,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Three years ago it was my fortune--my great misfortune--to sail
5950,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"from Gravesend to Bombay, on return from long leave, with one Agnes"
5951,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer on the Bombay side. It does not in"
5952,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was. Be content
5953,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"with the knowledge that, ere the voyage had ended, both she and I were"
5954,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another. Heaven knows
5955,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that I can make the admission now without one particle of vanity. In
5956,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who
5957,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"accepts. From the first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was"
5958,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"conscious that Agnes's passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and--if"
5959,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I may use the expression--a purer sentiment than mine. Whether she
5960,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"recognized the fact then, I do not know. Afterward it was bitterly plain"
5961,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to both of us.
5962,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5963,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective"
5964,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ways, to meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave"
5965,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and her love took us both to Simla. There we spent the season together;
5966,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and there my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the
5967,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,closing year. I attempt no excuse. I make no apology. Mrs. Wessington
5968,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"had given up much for my sake, and was prepared to give up all. From my"
5969,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"own lips, in August, 1882, she learned that I was sick of her presence,"
5970,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"tired of her company, and weary of the sound of her voice. Ninety-nine"
5971,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as I wearied of them;
5972,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,seventy-five of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by
5973,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,active and obtrusive flirtation with other men. Mrs. Wessington was the
5974,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,hundredth. On her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting
5975,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the least effect.
5976,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Jack, darling!"" was her one eternal cuckoo cry: ""I'm sure it's all a"
5977,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,mistake--a hideous mistake; and we'll be good friends again some day.
5978,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Please forgive me, Jack, dear."""
5979,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5980,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I was the offender, and I knew it. That knowledge transformed my pity"
5981,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"into passive endurance, and, eventually, into blind hate--the same"
5982,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"instinct, I suppose, which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider"
5983,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,he has but half killed. And with this hate in my bosom the season of
5984,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,1882 came to an end.
5985,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
5986,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Next year we met again at Simla--she with her monotonous face and timid
5987,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"attempts at reconciliation, and I with loathing of her in every fibre of"
5988,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,my frame. Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone; and on each
5989,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,occasion her words were identically the same. Still the unreasoning wail
5990,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"that it was all a ""mistake""; and still the hope of eventually ""making"
5991,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"friends."" I might have seen had I cared to look, that that hope only was"
5992,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,keeping her alive. She grew more wan and thin month by month. You will
5993,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"agree with me, at least, that such conduct would have driven any one to"
5994,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,despair. It was uncalled for; childish; unwomanly. I maintain that she
5995,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"was much to blame. And again, sometimes, in the black, fever-stricken"
5996,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"night-watches, I have begun to think that I might have been a little"
5997,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"kinder to her. But that really is a ""delusion."" I could not have"
5998,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,continued pretending to love her when I didn't; could I? It would have
5999,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,been unfair to us both.
6000,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6001,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Last year we met again--on the same terms as before. The same weary
6002,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"appeal, and the same curt answers from my lips. At least I would make"
6003,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the
6004,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"old relationship. As the season wore on, we fell apart--that is to say,"
6005,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"she found it difficult to meet me, for I had other and more absorbing"
6006,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"interests to attend to. When I think it over quietly in my sick-room,"
6007,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade
6008,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,were fantastically intermingled--my courtship of little Kitty Mannering;
6009,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"my hopes, doubts, and fears; our long rides together; my trembling"
6010,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,avowal of attachment; her reply; and now and again a vision of a white
6011,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,face flitting by in the 'rickshaw with the black and white liveries
6012,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I once watched for so earnestly; the wave of Mrs. Wessington's gloved
6013,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"hand; and, when she met me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome"
6014,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"monotony of her appeal. I loved Kitty Mannering; honestly, heartily"
6015,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"loved her, and with my love for her grew my hatred for Agnes. In August"
6016,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Kitty and I were engaged. The next day I met those accursed ""magpie"""
6017,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"jhampanies at the back of Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment of"
6018,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"pity, stopped to tell Mrs. Wessington everything. She knew it already."
6019,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6020,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""So I hear you're engaged, Jack dear."" Then, without a moment's"
6021,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"pause--""I'm sure it's all a mistake--a hideous mistake. We shall be as"
6022,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"good friends some day, Jack, as we ever were."""
6023,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6024,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,My answer might have made even a man wince. It cut the dying woman
6025,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"before me like the blow of a whip. ""Please forgive me, Jack; I didn't"
6026,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"mean to make you angry; but it's true, it's true!"""
6027,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6028,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely. I turned away and left her to
6029,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"finish her journey in peace, feeling, but only for a moment or two, that"
6030,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I had been an unutterably mean hound. I looked back, and saw that she"
6031,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"had turned her 'rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me."
6032,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6033,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory.
6034,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6035,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"The rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the wet weather), the sodden,"
6036,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"dingy pines, the muddy road, and the black powder-riven cliffs formed"
6037,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,a gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of
6038,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the jhampanies, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Wessington's"
6039,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,down-bowed golden head stood out clearly. She was holding her
6040,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning back exhausted against
6041,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the 'rickshaw cushions. I turned my horse up a bypath near the Sanjowlie
6042,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Reservoir and literally ran away. Once I fancied I heard a faint call
6043,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of ""Jack!"" This may have been imagination. I never stopped to verify it."
6044,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Ten minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback; and, in the delight"
6045,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of a long ride with her, forgot all about the interview."
6046,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6047,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her"
6048,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,existence was removed from my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy.
6049,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except"
6050,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me
6051,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,unpleasantly of our bygone relationship. By January I had disinterred
6052,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings
6053,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"and had burned it. At the beginning of April of this year, 1885, I was"
6054,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"at Simla--semi-deserted Simla--once more, and was deep in lover's talks"
6055,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and walks with Kitty. It was decided that we should be married at the
6056,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"end of June. You will understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty as I"
6057,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"did, I am not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been, at"
6058,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"that time, the happiest man in India."
6059,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6060,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their flight.
6061,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6062,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals"
6063,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"circumstanced as we were, I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement ring"
6064,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and
6065,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that she must forthwith come to Hamilton's to be measured for one. Up to
6066,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"that moment, I give you my word, we had completely forgotten so trivial"
6067,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"a matter. To Hamilton's we accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885."
6068,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Remember that--whatever my doctor may say to the contrary--I was then in
6069,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"perfect health, enjoying a well-balanced mind and an absolute tranquil"
6070,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"spirit. Kitty and I entered Hamilton's shop together, and there,"
6071,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"regardless of the order of affairs, I measured Kitty for the ring in"
6072,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the presence of the amused assistant. The ring was a sapphire with two
6073,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,diamonds. We then rode out down the slope that leads to the Combermere
6074,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Bridge and Peliti's shop.
6075,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6076,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and"
6077,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Kitty was laughing and chattering at my side--while all Simla, that is"
6078,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped round"
6079,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the Reading-room and Peliti's veranda,--I was aware that some one,"
6080,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name. It"
6081,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"struck me that I had heard the voice before, but when and where I could"
6082,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,not at once determine. In the short space it took to cover the road
6083,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,between the path from Hamilton's shop and the first plank of the
6084,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Combermere Bridge I had thought over half a dozen people who might have
6085,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided that it must have"
6086,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,been singing in my ears. Immediately opposite Peliti's shop my eye was
6087,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"arrested by the sight of four jharnpanies in ""magpie"" livery, pulling a"
6088,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar 'rickshaw. In a moment my mind flew back to"
6089,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with a sense of irritation and
6090,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"disgust. Was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with,"
6091,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,without her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the day's
6092,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"happiness? Whoever employed them now I thought I would call upon, and"
6093,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,ask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies' livery. I would hire
6094,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the men myself, and, if necessary, buy their coats from off their backs."
6095,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,It is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their
6096,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,presence evoked.
6097,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6098,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Kitty,"" I cried, ""there are poor Mrs. Wessington's jhampanies turned up"
6099,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"again! I wonder who has them now?"""
6100,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6101,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season, and had always"
6102,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"been interested in the sickly woman. ""What? Where?"" she asked. ""I can't"
6103,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"see them anywhere."""
6104,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6105,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Even as she spoke her horse, swerving from a laden mule, threw himself"
6106,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,directly in front of the advancing 'rickshaw. I had scarcely time to
6107,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"utter a word of warning when, to my unutterable horror, horse and rider"
6108,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,passed through men and carriage as if they had been thin air.
6109,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6110,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""What's the matter?"" cried Kitty; ""what made you call out so foolishly,"
6111,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Jack? If I am engaged I don't want all creation to know about it. There
6112,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"was lots of space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you think I"
6113,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,can't ride--
6114,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6115,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""--There!"""
6116,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6117,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Whereupon wilful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a"
6118,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"hand-gallop in the direction of the Bandstand; fully expecting, as"
6119,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"she herself afterward told me, that I should follow her. What was the"
6120,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"matter? Nothing indeed. Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla"
6121,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"was haunted with devils. I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round."
6122,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"The 'rickshaw had turned too, and now stood immediately facing me, near"
6123,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the left railing of the Combermere Bridge.
6124,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6125,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Jack! Jack, darling!"" (There was no mistake about the words this time:"
6126,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear.) ""It's"
6127,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"some hideous mistake, I'm sure. Please forgive me, jack, and let's be"
6128,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"friends again."""
6129,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6130,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"The 'rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope and pray daily"
6131,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"for the death I dread by night, sat Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief"
6132,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in hand, and golden head bowed on her breast."
6133,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6134,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"How long I stared motionless I do not know. Finally, I was aroused by"
6135,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,my syce taking the Waler's bridle and asking whether I was ill. From the
6136,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,horrible to the commonplace is but a step. I tumbled off my horse and
6137,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"dashed, half fainting, into Peliti's for a glass of cherry-brandy. There"
6138,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,two or three couples were gathered round the coffee-tables discussing
6139,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the gossip of the day. Their trivialities were more comforting to me
6140,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,just then than the consolations of religion could have been. I plunged
6141,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"into the midst of the conversation at once; chatted, laughed, and jested"
6142,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,with a face (when I caught a glimpse of it in a mirror) as white and
6143,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"drawn as that of a corpse. Three or four men noticed my condition; and,"
6144,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"evidently setting it down to the results of over-many pegs, charitably"
6145,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,endeavoured to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers. But I
6146,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,refused to be led away. I wanted the company of my kind--as a child
6147,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,rushes into the midst of the dinner-party after a fright in the dark.
6148,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I must have talked for about ten minutes or so, though it seemed an"
6149,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"eternity to me, when I heard Kitty's clear voice outside inquiring for"
6150,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"me. In another minute she had entered the shop, prepared to roundly"
6151,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties. Something in my face
6152,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,stopped her.
6153,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6154,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Why, Jack,"" she cried, ""what have you been doing? What has happened?"
6155,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Are you ill?"" Thus driven into a direct lie, I said that the sun had"
6156,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,been a little too much for me. It was close upon five o'clock of a
6157,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"cloudy April afternoon, and the sun had been hidden all day. I saw my"
6158,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth: attempted to recover
6159,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"it; blundered hopelessly and followed Kitty in a regal rage, out of"
6160,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"doors, amid the smiles of my acquaintances. I made some excuse (I have"
6161,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,forgotten what) on the score of my feeling faint; and cantered away to
6162,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"my hotel, leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself."
6163,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6164,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter.
6165,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6166,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Here was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated Bengal Civilian in"
6167,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the year of grace, 1885, presumably sane, certainly healthy, driven in"
6168,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,terror from my sweetheart's side by the apparition of a woman who had
6169,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,been dead and buried eight months ago. These were facts that I could
6170,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,not blink. Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of Mrs.
6171,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Wessington when Kitty and I left Hamilton's shop. Nothing was more
6172,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,utterly commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite Peliti's. It was
6173,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"broad daylight. The road was full of people; and yet here, look you,"
6174,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in defiance of every law of probability, in direct outrage of Nature's"
6175,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ordinance, there had appeared to me a face from the grave."
6176,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6177,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Kitty's Arab had gone through the 'rickshaw: so that my first hope that
6178,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,some woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington had hired the carriage and
6179,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the coolies with their old livery was lost. Again and again I went round
6180,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,this treadmill of thought; and again and again gave up baffled and
6181,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,in despair. The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition. I had
6182,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,originally some wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty; of begging her
6183,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to marry me at once; and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the
6184,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"'rickshaw. ""After all,"" I argued, ""the presence of the 'rickshaw is in"
6185,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion. One may see
6186,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ghosts of men and women, but surely never of coolies and carriages. The"
6187,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"whole thing is absurd. Fancy the ghost of a hill-man!"""
6188,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6189,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring her to overlook"
6190,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,my strange conduct of the previous afternoon. My Divinity was still very
6191,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"wroth, and a personal apology was necessary. I explained, with a fluency"
6192,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"born of night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been attacked"
6193,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,with sudden palpitation of the heart--the result of indigestion. This
6194,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,eminently practical solution had its effect; and Kitty and I rode out
6195,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us.
6196,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6197,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko. With my nerves still
6198,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,"
6199,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road--anything"
6200,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,rather than the Jakko round. Kitty was angry and a little hurt: so I
6201,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding, and we set out"
6202,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"together toward Chota Simla. We walked a greater part of the way, and,"
6203,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"according to our custom, cantered from a mile or so below the Convent"
6204,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to the stretch of level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir. The wretched
6205,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"horses appeared to fly, and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we"
6206,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,neared the crest of the ascent. My mind had been full of Mrs. Wessington
6207,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,all the afternoon; and every inch of the Jakko road bore witness to our
6208,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,oldtime walks and talks. The bowlders were full of it; the pines sang it
6209,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,aloud overhead; the rain-fed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over
6210,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud.
6211,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6212,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call the Ladies'"
6213,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Mile the Horror was awaiting me. No other 'rickshaw was in sight--only
6214,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the four black and white jhampanies, the yellow-paneled carriage, and"
6215,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the golden head of the woman within--all apparently just as I had left
6216,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,them eight months and one fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that
6217,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Kitty must see what I saw--we were so marvelously sympathetic in all
6218,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"things. Her next words undeceived me--""Not a soul in sight! Come along,"
6219,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Jack, and I'll race you to the Reservoir buildings!"" Her wiry little"
6220,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close behind, and in this"
6221,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us within fifty
6222,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,yards of the 'rickshaw. I pulled my Waler and fell back a little. The
6223,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,'rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road; and once more the Arab
6224,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"passed through it, my horse following. ""Jack! Jack dear! Please forgive"
6225,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"me,"" rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval:--""It's a"
6226,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"mistake, a hideous mistake!"""
6227,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6228,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I spurred my horse like a man possessed. When I turned my head at
6229,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the Reservoir works, the black and white liveries were still"
6230,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"waiting--patiently waiting--under the grey hillside, and the wind"
6231,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,brought me a mocking echo of the words I had just heard. Kitty bantered
6232,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride. I had
6233,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,been talking up till then wildly and at random.
6234,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6235,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"To save my life I could not speak afterward naturally, and from"
6236,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Sanjowlie to the Church wisely held my tongue.
6237,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6238,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I was to dine with the Mannerings that night, and had barely time to"
6239,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,canter home to dress. On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men
6240,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"talking together in the dusk.--""It's a curious thing,"" said one, ""how"
6241,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,completely all trace of it disappeared. You know my wife was insanely
6242,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"fond of the woman ('never could see anything in her myself), and wanted"
6243,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,me to pick up her old 'rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for
6244,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,love or money. Morbid sort of fancy I call it; but I've got to do what
6245,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the Memsahib tells me.
6246,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6247,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four"
6248,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of the men--they were brothers--died of cholera on the way to Hardwar,"
6249,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"poor devils, and the 'rickshaw has been broken up by the man himself."
6250,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,'Told me he never used a dead Memsahib's 'rickshaw. 'Spoiled his luck.'
6251,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Queer notion, wasn't it? Fancy poor little Mrs. Wessington spoiling any"
6252,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"one's luck except her own!"" I laughed aloud at this point; and my laugh"
6253,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,jarred on me as I uttered it. So there were ghosts of 'rickshaws after
6254,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"all, and ghostly employments in the other world! How much did Mrs."
6255,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Wessington give her men? What were their hours? Where did they go?
6256,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6257,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,And for visible answer to my last question I saw the infernal Thing
6258,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"blocking my path in the twilight. The dead travel fast, and by short"
6259,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,cuts unknown to ordinary coolies. I laughed aloud a second time and
6260,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"checked my laughter suddenly, for I was afraid I was going mad. Mad to"
6261,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"a certain extent I must have been, for I recollect that I reined in my"
6262,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"horse at the head of the 'rickshaw, and politely wished Mrs. Wessington"
6263,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Good evening."" Her answer was one I knew only too well. I listened"
6264,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"to the end; and replied that I had heard it all before, but should"
6265,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,be delighted if she had anything further to say. Some malignant devil
6266,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"stronger than I must have entered into me that evening, for I have a dim"
6267,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to
6268,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the Thing in front of me.
6269,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6270,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Mad as a hatter, poor devil--or drunk. Max, try and get him to come"
6271,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"home."""
6272,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6273,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Surely that was not Mrs. Wessington's voice! The two men had overheard
6274,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"me speaking to the empty air, and had returned to look after me. They"
6275,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"were very kind and considerate, and from their words evidently gathered"
6276,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that I was extremely drunk. I thanked them confusedly and cantered away
6277,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"to my hotel, there changed, and arrived at the Mannerings' ten minutes"
6278,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,late. I pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse; was rebuked by
6279,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Kitty for my unlover-like tardiness; and sat down.
6280,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6281,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"The conversation had already become general; and under cover of it, I"
6282,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when I was aware
6283,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that at the further end of the table a short red-whiskered man was
6284,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"describing, with much broidery, his encounter with a mad unknown that"
6285,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,evening.
6286,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6287,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half
6288,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"an hour ago. In the middle of the story he looked round for applause, as"
6289,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"professional story-tellers do, caught my eye, and straightway collapsed."
6290,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"There was a moment's awkward silence, and the red-whiskered man muttered"
6291,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"something to the effect that he had ""forgotten the rest,"" thereby"
6292,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,sacrificing a reputation as a good story-teller which he had built
6293,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"up for six seasons past. I blessed him from the bottom of my heart,"
6294,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and--went on with my fish.
6295,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6296,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,In the fulness of time that dinner came to an end; and with genuine
6297,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,regret I tore myself away from Kitty--as certain as I was of my
6298,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,own existence that It would be waiting for me outside the door. The
6299,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"red-whiskered man, who had been introduced to me as Doctor Heatherlegh,"
6300,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of Simla, volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay"
6301,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,together. I accepted his offer with gratitude.
6302,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6303,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"My instinct had not deceived me. It lay in readiness in the Mall, and,"
6304,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways, with a lighted head-lamp."
6305,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"The red-whiskered man went to the point at once, in a manner that showed"
6306,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,he bad been thinking over it all dinner time.
6307,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6308,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on"
6309,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the Elysium road?"" The suddenness of the question wrenched an answer"
6310,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,from me before I was aware.
6311,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6312,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""That!"" said I, pointing to It."
6313,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6314,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""That may be either D. T. or Eyes for aught I know. Now you don't"
6315,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"liquor. I saw as much at dinner, so it can't be D. T. There's nothing"
6316,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"whatever where you're pointing, though you're sweating and trembling"
6317,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"with fright like a scared pony. Therefore, I conclude that it's Eyes."
6318,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,And I ought to understand all about them. Come along home with me. I'm
6319,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"on the Blessington lower road."""
6320,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6321,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,To my intense delight the 'rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept
6322,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"about twenty yards ahead--and this, too whether we walked, trotted, or"
6323,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,cantered. In the course of that long night ride I had told my companion
6324,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,almost as much as I have told you here.
6325,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6326,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Well, you've spoiled one of the best tales I've ever laid tongue to,"""
6327,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"said he, ""but I'll forgive you for the sake of what you've gone through."
6328,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Now come home and do what I tell you; and when I've cured you,"
6329,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"young man, let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and"
6330,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"indigestible food till the day of your death."""
6331,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6332,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,The 'rickshaw kept steady in front; and my red-whiskered friend seemed
6333,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts.
6334,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6335,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Eyes, Pansay--all Eyes, Brain, and Stomach. And the greatest of these"
6336,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"three is Stomach. You've too much conceited Brain, too little Stomach,"
6337,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and thoroughly unhealthy Eyes. Get your Stomach straight and the rest
6338,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,follows. And all that's French for a liver pill.
6339,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6340,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""I'll take sole medical charge of you from this hour! for you're too"
6341,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"interesting a phenomenon to be passed over."""
6342,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6343,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington lower road
6344,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"and the 'rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pine-clad, over-hanging"
6345,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"shale cliff. Instinctively I halted too, giving my reason. Heatherlegh"
6346,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,rapped out an oath.
6347,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6348,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Now, if you think I'm going to spend a cold night on the hillside"
6349,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"for the sake of a stomach-cum-Brain-cum-Eye illusion--Lord, ha' mercy!"
6350,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"What's that?"""
6351,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6352,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"There was a muffled report, a blinding smother of dust just in front"
6353,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of us, a crack, the noise of rent boughs, and about ten yards of the"
6354,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"cliff-side--pines, undergrowth, and all--slid down into the road below,"
6355,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,completely blocking it up. The uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a
6356,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"moment like drunken giants in the gloom, and then fell prone among their"
6357,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,fellows with a thunderous crash. Our two horses stood motionless and
6358,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,sweating with fear. As soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had
6359,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"subsided, my companion muttered:--""Man, if we'd gone forward we should"
6360,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,have been ten feet deep in our graves by now. 'There are more things
6361,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in heaven and earth...' Come home, Pansay, and thank God. I want a peg"
6362,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"badly."""
6363,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6364,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"We retraced our way over the Church Ridge, and I arrived at Dr."
6365,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Heatherlegh's house shortly after midnight.
6366,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6367,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"His attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately, and for a week"
6368,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I never left his sight. Many a time in the course of that week did I
6369,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,bless the good fortune which had thrown me in contact with Simla's best
6370,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and kindest doctor. Day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable.
6371,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Day by day, too, I became more and more inclined to fall in with"
6372,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Heatherlegh's ""spectral illusion"" theory, implicating eyes, brain, and"
6373,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"stomach. I wrote to Kitty, telling her that a slight sprain caused by a"
6374,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days; and that I should be
6375,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,recovered before she had time to regret my absence.
6376,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6377,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Heatherlegh's treatment was simple to a degree. It consisted of liver
6378,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"pills, cold-water baths, and strong exercise, taken in the dusk or at"
6379,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"early dawn--for, as he sagely observed:--""A man with a sprained"
6380,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ankle doesn't walk a dozen miles a day, and your young woman might be"
6381,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"wondering if she saw you."""
6382,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6383,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"At the end of the week, after much examination of pupil and pulse, and"
6384,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"strict injunction' as to diet and pedestrianism, Heatherlegh dismissed"
6385,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me. Here is his parting
6386,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"benediction:--""Man, I can certify to your mental cure, and that's as"
6387,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"much as to say I've cured most of your bodily ailments. Now, get your"
6388,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,traps out of this as soon as you can; and be off to make love to Miss
6389,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Kitty."""
6390,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6391,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness. He cut me
6392,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,short.
6393,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6394,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Don't think I did this because I like you. I gather that you've behaved"
6395,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"like a blackguard all through. But, all the same, you re a phenomenon,"
6396,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard. No!""--checking me"
6397,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"a second time--""not a rupee please. Go out and see if you can find the"
6398,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,eyes-brain-and-stomach business again. I'll give you a lakh for each
6399,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"time you see it."""
6400,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6401,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Half an hour later I was in the Mannerings' drawing-room with
6402,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Kitty--drunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the
6403,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,fore-knowledge that I should never more be troubled with Its hideous
6404,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"presence. Strong in the sense of my new-found security, I proposed a"
6405,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ride at once; and, by preference, a canter round Jakko."
6406,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6407,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Never had I felt so well, so overladen with vitality and mere animal"
6408,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"spirits, as I did on the afternoon of the 30th of April. Kitty was"
6409,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"delighted at the change in my appearance, and complimented me on it in"
6410,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,her delightfully frank and outspoken manner. We left the Mannerings'
6411,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"house together, laughing and talking, and cantered along the Chota Simla"
6412,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,road as of old.
6413,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6414,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there make my
6415,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"assurance doubly sure. The horses did their best, but seemed all too"
6416,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,slow to my impatient mind. Kitty was astonished at my boisterousness.
6417,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Why, Jack!"" she cried at last, ""you are behaving like a child. What are"
6418,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"you doing?"""
6419,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6420,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"We were just below the Convent, and from sheer wantonness I was making"
6421,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,my Waler plunge and curvet across the road as I tickled it with the loop
6422,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,of my riding-whip.
6423,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6424,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Doing?"" I answered; ""nothing, dear. That's just it. If you'd been doing"

6430,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6431,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,My quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner
6432,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to
6433,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Sanjowlie. In the centre of the level road stood the black and white
6434,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington."
6435,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said"
6436,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,something. The next thing I knew was that I was lying face downward on
6437,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.
6438,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6439,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Has it gone, child?"" I gasped. Kitty only wept more bitterly."

6446,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Come and look at It."""
6447,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6448,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I have an indistinct idea that I dragged Kitty by the wrist along the
6449,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"road up to where It stood, and implored her for pity's sake to speak to"
6450,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,It; to tell It that we were betrothed; that neither Death nor Hell could
6451,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,break the tie between us; and Kitty only knows how much more to the
6452,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,same effect. Now and again I appealed passionately to the Terror in the
6453,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"'rickshaw to bear witness to all I had said, and to release me from"
6454,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,a torture that was killing me. As I talked I suppose I must have told
6455,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Kitty of my old relations with Mrs. Wessington, for I saw her listen"
6456,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,intently with white face and blazing eyes.
6457,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,

6464,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"cut of her riding-whip across my face from mouth to eye, and a word"
6465,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"or two of farewell that even now I cannot write down. So I judged, and"
6466,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"judged rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back to the side"
6467,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of the 'rickshaw. My face was cut and bleeding, and the blow of the"
6468,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,riding-whip had raised a livid blue wheal on it. I had no self-respect.
6469,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Just then, Heatherlegh, who must have been following Kitty and me at a"

6486,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6487,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Seven days later (on the 7th of May, that is to say) I was aware that I"
6488,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was lying in Heatherlegh's room as weak as a little child. Heatherlegh
6489,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writing-table.
6490,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,His first words were not encouraging; but I was too far spent to be much
6491,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,moved by them.
6492,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6493,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Here's Miss Kitty has sent back your letters. You corresponded a good"
6494,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"deal, you young people. Here's a packet that looks like a ring, and"
6495,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"a cheerful sort of a note from Mannering Papa, which I've taken the"
6496,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,liberty of reading and burning. The old gentleman's not pleased with
6497,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"you."""
6498,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6499,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""And Kitty?"" I asked, dully."
6500,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6501,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Rather more drawn than her father from what she says. By the same token"
6502,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just
6503,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,before I met you. 'Says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as
6504,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,you did to Mrs. Wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for
6505,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"his kind. She's a hot-headed little virago, your mash. 'Will have it"
6506,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,too that you were suffering from D. T. when that row on the Jakko road
6507,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"turned up. 'Says she'll die before she ever speaks to you again."""
6508,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6509,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I groaned and turned over to the other side.
6510,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6511,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Now you've got your choice, my friend. This engagement has to be broken"
6512,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,off; and the Mannerings don't want to be too hard on you. Was it broken
6513,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,through D. T. or epileptic fits? Sorry I can't offer you a better
6514,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,exchange unless you'd prefer hereditary insanity. Say the word and I'll
6515,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,tell 'em it's fits. All Simla knows about that scene on the Ladies'
6516,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Mile. Come! I'll give you five minutes to think over it."""
6517,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6518,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,During those five minutes I believe that I explored thoroughly the
6519,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,lowest circles of the Inferno which it is permitted man to tread on
6520,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,earth. And at the same time I myself was watching myself faltering
6521,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"through the dark labyrinths of doubt, misery, and utter despair."
6522,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I wondered, as Heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered, which"
6523,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,dreadful alternative I should adopt. Presently I heard myself answering
6524,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in a voice that I hardly recognized, ""--They're confoundedly particular"
6525,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"about morality in these parts. Give 'em fits, Heatherlegh, and my love."
6526,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Now let me sleep a bit longer."""
6527,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6528,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Then my two selves joined, and it was only I (half crazed, devil-driven"
6529,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I) that tossed in my bed, tracing step by step the history of the past"
6530,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,month.
6531,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6532,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""But I am in Simla,"" I kept repeating to myself. ""I, Jack Pansay, am in"
6533,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Simla and there are no ghosts here. It's unreasonable of that woman to
6534,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,pretend there are. Why couldn't Agnes have left me alone? I never did
6535,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,her any harm. It might just as well have been me as Agnes. Only I'd
6536,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,never have come back on purpose to kill her. Why can't I be left
6537,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"alone--left alone and happy?"""
6538,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6539,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"It was high noon when I first awoke, and the sun was low in the sky"
6540,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"before I slept--slept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack, too"
6541,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,worn to feel further pain.
6542,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6543,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Next day I could not leave my bed. Heatherlegh told me in the morning
6544,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"that he had received an answer from Mr. Mannering, and that, thanks to"
6545,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"his (Heatherlegh's) friendly offices, the story of my affliction had"
6546,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"traveled through the length and breadth of Simla, where I was on all"
6547,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,sides much pitied.
6548,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6549,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""And that's rather more than you deserve,"" he concluded, pleasantly,"
6550,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""though the Lord knows you've been going through a pretty severe mill."
6551,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Never mind; we'll cure you yet, you perverse phenomenon."""
6552,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6553,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"I declined firmly to be cured. ""You've been much too good to me already,"
6554,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"old man,"" said I; ""but I don't think I need trouble you further."""
6555,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6556,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,In my heart I knew that nothing Heatherlegh could do would lighten the
6557,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,burden that had been laid upon me.
6558,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6559,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"With that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless, impotent rebellion"
6560,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,against the unreasonableness of it all. There were scores of men no
6561,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,better than I whose punishments had at least been reserved for another
6562,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"world; and I felt that it was bitterly, cruelly unfair that I alone"
6563,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,should have been singled out for so hideous a fate. This mood would in
6564,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,time give place to another where it seemed that the 'rickshaw and I were
6565,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the only realities in a world of shadows; that Kitty was a ghost; that
6566,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Mannering, Heatherlegh, and all the other men and women I knew were all"
6567,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ghosts; and the great, grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised"
6568,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to torture me. From mood to mood I tossed backward and forward for
6569,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"seven weary days; my body growing daily stronger and stronger, until the"
6570,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"bedroom looking-glass told me that I had returned to everyday life, and"
6571,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was as other men once more. Curiously enough my face showed no signs
6572,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of the struggle I had gone through. It was pale indeed, but as"
6573,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,expressionless and commonplace as ever. I had expected some permanent
6574,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,alteration--visible evidence of the disease that was eating me away. I
6575,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,found nothing.
6576,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6577,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"On the 15th of May, I left Heatherlegh's house at eleven o'clock in the"
6578,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,morning; and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the Club. There I
6579,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"found that every man knew my story as told by Heatherlegh, and was, in"
6580,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"clumsy fashion, abnormally kind and attentive. Nevertheless I recognized"
6581,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that for the rest of my natural life I should be among but not of my
6582,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,fellows; and I envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on
6583,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the Mall below. I lunched at the Club, and at four o'clock wandered"
6584,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,aimlessly down the Mall in the vague hope of meeting Kitty. Close to
6585,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the Band-stand the black and white liveries joined me; and I heard Mrs.
6586,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Wessington's old appeal at my side. I had been expecting this ever since
6587,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I came out; and was only surprised at her delay. The phantom 'rickshaw
6588,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and I went side by side along the Chota Simla road in silence. Close to
6589,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the bazar, Kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us. For any"
6590,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,sign she gave I might have been a dog in the road. She did not even pay
6591,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,me the compliment of quickening her pace; though the rainy afternoon had
6592,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,served for an excuse.
6593,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6594,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"So Kitty and her companion, and I and my ghostly Light-o'-Love, crept"
6595,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,round Jakko in couples. The road was streaming with water; the pines
6596,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"dripped like roof-pipes on the rocks below, and the air was full of"
6597,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"fine, driving rain. Two or three times I found myself saying to myself"
6598,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"almost aloud: ""I'm Jack Pansay on leave at Simla--at Simla! Everyday,"
6599,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"ordinary Simla. I mustn't forget that--I mustn't forget that."" Then I"
6600,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,would try to recollect some of the gossip I had heard at the Club: the
6601,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"prices of So-and-So's horses--anything, in fact, that related to"
6602,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the workaday Anglo-Indian world I knew so well. I even repeated the
6603,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"multiplication-table rapidly to myself, to make quite sure that I was"
6604,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,not taking leave of my senses. It gave me much comfort; and must have
6605,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,prevented my hearing Mrs. Wessington for a time.
6606,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6607,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Once more I wearily climbed the Convent slope and entered the level
6608,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"road. Here Kitty and the man started off at a canter, and I was left"
6609,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"alone with Mrs. Wessington. ""Agnes,"" said I, ""will you put back your"
6610,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"hood and tell me what it all means?"" The hood dropped noiselessly, and"
6611,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I was face to face with my dead and buried mistress. She was wearing
6612,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the dress in which I had last seen her alive; carried the same tiny
6613,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,handkerchief in her right hand; and the same cardcase in her left. (A
6614,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,woman eight months dead with a cardcase!) I had to pin myself down to
6615,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the multiplication-table, and to set both hands on the stone parapet of"
6616,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the road, to assure myself that that at least was real."
6617,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6618,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"""Agnes,"" I repeated, ""for pity's sake tell me what it all means."" Mrs."
6619,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Wessington leaned forward, with that odd, quick turn of the head I used"
6620,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"to know so well, and spoke."
6621,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6622,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,If my story had not already so madly overleaped the hounds of all human
6623,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"belief I should apologize to you now. As I know that no one--no, not"
6624,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"even Kitty, for whom it is written as some sort of justification of"
6625,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"my conduct--will believe me, I will go on. Mrs. Wessington spoke and"
6626,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I walked with her from the Sanjowlie road to the turning below the
6627,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Commander-in-Chief's house as I might walk by the side of any living
6628,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"woman's 'rickshaw, deep in conversation. The second and most tormenting"
6629,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me, and like the"
6630,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Prince in Tennyson's poem, ""I seemed to move amid a world of ghosts."""
6631,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"There had been a garden-party at the Commander-in-Chief's, and we two"
6632,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,joined the crowd of homeward-bound folk. As I saw them then it seemed
6633,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"that they were the shadows--impalpable, fantastic shadows--that divided"
6634,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,for Mrs. Wessington's 'rickshaw to pass through. What we said during
6635,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"the course of that weird interview I cannot--indeed, I dare not--tell."
6636,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Heatherlegh's comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that I
6637,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"had been ""mashing a brain-eye-and-stomach chimera."" It was a ghastly and"
6638,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience. Could it be
6639,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"possible, I wondered, that I was in this life to woo a second time the"
6640,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,woman I had killed by my own neglect and cruelty?
6641,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6642,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I met Kitty on the homeward road--a shadow among shadows.
6643,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6644,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,If I were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their
6645,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"order, my story would never come to an end; and your patience would Be"
6646,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,exhausted. Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly
6647,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,'rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together. Wherever I went
6648,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company
6649,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to and from my hotel. At the Theatre I found them amid the crowd of
6650,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"yelling jhampanies; outside the Club veranda, after a long evening of"
6651,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"whist; at the Birthday Ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and"
6652,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"in broad daylight when I went calling. Save that it cast no shadow, the"
6653,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,'rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and
6654,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"iron. More than once, indeed, I have had to check myself from warning"
6655,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,some hard-riding friend against cantering over it. More than once I have
6656,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,walked down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the
6657,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,unspeakable amazement of the passers-by.
6658,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6659,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Before I had been out and about a week I learned that the ""fit"" theory"
6660,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"had been discarded in favor of insanity. However, I made no change in my"
6661,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"mode of life. I called, rode, and dined out as freely as ever. I had"
6662,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,a passion for the society of my kind which I had never felt before; I
6663,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,hungered to be among the realities of life; and at the same time I
6664,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,felt vaguely unhappy when I had been separated too long from my ghostly
6665,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,companion. It would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods
6666,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,from the 15th of May up to today.
6667,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6668,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"The presence of the 'rickshaw filled me by turns with horror, blind"
6669,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"fear, a dim sort of pleasure, and utter despair. I dared not leave"
6670,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Simla; and I knew that my stay there was killing me. I knew, moreover,"
6671,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day. My only
6672,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be. Alternately
6673,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I hungered for a sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations
6674,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"with my successor--to speak more accurately, my successors--with amused"
6675,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,interest. She was as much out of my life as I was out of hers. By day I
6676,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,wandered with Mrs. Wessington almost content. By night I implored Heaven
6677,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,to let me return to the world as I used to know it. Above all these
6678,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"varying moods lay the sensation of dull, numbing wonder that the Seen"
6679,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and the Unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one
6680,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,poor soul to its grave.

6683,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6684,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,August 27.--Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on me;
6685,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and only yesterday told me that I ought to send in an application for
6686,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,sick leave. An application to escape the company of a phantom! A request
6687,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,that the Government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts
6688,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,and an airy 'rickshaw by going to England. Heatherlegh's proposition
6689,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,moved me to almost hysterical laughter. I told him that I should await
6690,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,the end quietly at Simla; and I am sure that the end is not far off.
6691,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Believe me that I dread its advent more than any word can say; and I
6692,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of
6693,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,my death.
6694,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6695,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Shall I die in my bed decently and as an English gentleman should die;
6696,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"or, in one last walk on the Mall, will my soul be wrenched from me to"
6697,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,take its place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm?
6698,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"Shall I return to my old lost allegiance in the next world, or shall"
6699,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,I meet Agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity?
6700,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,Shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of Time?
6701,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"As the day of my death draws nearer, the intense horror that all living"
6702,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,flesh feels toward escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and
6703,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,more powerful. It is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with
6704,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,scarcely one-half of your life completed. It is a thousand times more
6705,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"awful to wait as I do in your midst, for I know not what unimaginable"
6706,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"terror. Pity me, at least on the score of my ""delusion,"" for I know you"
6707,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,will never believe what I have written here Yet as surely as ever a man
6708,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,was done to death by the Powers of Darkness I am that man.
6709,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,
6710,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"In justice, too, pity her. For as surely as ever woman was killed by"
6711,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,"man, I killed Mrs. Wessington. And the last portion of my punishment is"
6712,THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW,ever now upon me.

6764,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Provinces simply bristle with haunted houses, and march phantom armies"
6765,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,along their main thoroughfares.
6766,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6767,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Some of the dak-bungalows on the Grand Trunk Road have handy little
6768,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"cemeteries in their compound--witnesses to the ""changes and chances"
6769,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"of this mortal life"" in the days when men drove from Calcutta to the"
6770,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Northwest. These bungalows are objectionable places to put up in. They
6771,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"are generally very old, always dirty, while the khansamah is as ancient"
6772,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"as the bungalow. He either chatters senilely, or falls into the long"
6773,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"trances of age. In both moods he is useless. If you get angry with him,"
6774,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"he refers to some Sahib dead and buried these thirty years, and says"
6775,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,that when he was in that Sahib's service not a khansamah in the Province
6776,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,could touch him. Then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among
6777,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"the dishes, and you repent of your irritation."
6778,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6779,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"In these dak-bungalows, ghosts are most likely to be found, and when"
6780,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"found, they should be made a note of. Not long ago it was my business to"
6781,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,live in dak-bungalows. I never inhabited the same house for three
6782,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"nights running, and grew to be learned in the breed. I lived in"
6783,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Government-built ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings, an"
6784,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"inventory of the furniture posted in every room, and an excited snake at"
6785,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"the threshold to give welcome. I lived in ""converted"" ones--old houses"
6786,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,officiating as dak-bungalows--where nothing was in its proper place
6787,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,and there wasn't even a fowl for dinner. I lived in second-hand
6788,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,palaces where the wind blew through open-work marble tracery just as
6789,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,uncomfortably as through a broken pane. I lived in dak-bungalows where
6790,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"the last entry in the visitors' book was fifteen months old, and where"
6791,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,they slashed off the curry-kid's head with a sword. It was my good
6792,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"luck to meet all sorts of men, from sober traveling missionaries and"
6793,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"deserters flying from British Regiments, to drunken loafers who threw"
6794,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,whisky bottles at all who passed; and my still greater good fortune just
6795,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,to escape a maternity case. Seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy
6796,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"of our lives out here acted itself in dak-bungalows, I wondered that"
6797,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,I had met no ghosts. A ghost that would voluntarily hang about a
6798,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,dak-bungalow would be mad of course; but so many men have died mad in
6799,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,dak-bungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts.
6800,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6801,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"In due time I found my ghost, or ghosts rather, for there were two of"
6802,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,them. Up till that hour I had sympathized with Mr. Besant's method of
6803,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"handling them, as shown in ""The Strange Case of Mr. Lucraft and Other"
6804,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Stories."" I am now in the Opposition."
6805,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6806,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,We will call the bungalow Katmal dak-bungalow. But THAT was the smallest
6807,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,part of the horror. A man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in
6808,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,dak-bungalows. He should marry. Katmal dak-bungalow was old and rotten
6809,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"and unrepaired. The floor was of worn brick, the walls were filthy, and"
6810,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,the windows were nearly black with grime. It stood on a bypath largely
6811,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"used by native Sub-Deputy Assistants of all kinds, from Finance to"
6812,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Forests; but real Sahibs were rare. The khansamah, who was nearly bent"
6813,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"double with old age, said so."
6814,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6815,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"When I arrived, there was a fitful, undecided rain on the face of the"
6816,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"land, accompanied by a restless wind, and every gust made a noise"
6817,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside. The
6818,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival. He had served a Sahib
6819,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,once. Did I know that Sahib? He gave me the name of a well-known man who
6820,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"has been buried for more than a quarter of a century, and showed me an"
6821,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth. I had seen a
6822,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of Memoirs a month
6823,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"before, and I felt ancient beyond telling."
6824,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6825,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,The day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food. He did not go
6826,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"through the pretense of calling it ""khana""--man's victuals. He said"
6827,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""ratub,"" and that means, among other things, ""grub""--dog's rations."
6828,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,There was no insult in his choice of the term. He had forgotten the
6829,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"other word, I suppose."
6830,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6831,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals, I settled myself"
6832,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"down, after exploring the dak-bungalow. There were three rooms, beside"
6833,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"my own, which was a corner kennel, each giving into the other through"
6834,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars. The bungalow was a very
6835,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"solid one, but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerry-built"
6836,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,in their flimsiness. Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room
6837,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"down the other three, and every footfall came back tremulously from the"
6838,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,far walls. For this reason I shut the door. There were no lamps--only
6839,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,candles in long glass shades. An oil wick was set in the bathroom.
6840,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6841,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"For bleak, unadulterated misery that dak-bungalow was the worst of"
6842,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"the many that I had ever set foot in. There was no fireplace, and"
6843,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,the windows would not open; so a brazier of charcoal would have been
6844,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,useless. The rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the
6845,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"house, and the toddy palms rattled and roared."
6846,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6847,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing, and a hyena"
6848,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,stood afar off and mocked them. A hyena would convince a Sadducee of the
6849,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Resurrection of the Dead--the worst sort of Dead. Then came the ratub--a
6850,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"curious meal, half native and half English in composition--with the old"
6851,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone English people,"
6852,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,and the wind-blown candles playing shadow-bo-peep with the bed and the
6853,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,mosquito-curtains. It was just the sort of dinner and evening to make
6854,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"a man think of every single one of his past sins, and of all the others"
6855,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,that he intended to commit if he lived.
6856,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6857,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Sleep, for several hundred reasons, was not easy. The lamp in the"
6858,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"bath-room threw the most absurd shadows into the room, and the wind was"
6859,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,beginning to talk nonsense.
6860,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6861,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Just when the reasons were drowsy with blood-sucking I heard the
6862,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"regular--""Let--us--take--and--heave--him--over"" grunt of doolie-bearers"
6863,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"in the compound. First one doolie came in, then a second, and then a"
6864,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"third. I heard the doolies dumped on the ground, and the shutter in"
6865,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"front of my door shook. ""That's some one trying to come in,"" I said."
6866,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"But no one spoke, and I persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind. The"
6867,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"shutter of the room next to mine was attacked, flung back, and the inner"
6868,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"door opened. ""That's some Sub-Deputy Assistant,"" I said, ""and he has"
6869,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,brought his friends with him. Now they'll talk and spit and smoke for an
6870,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"hour."""
6871,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6872,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,But there were no voices and no footsteps. No one was putting his
6873,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"luggage into the next room. The door shut, and I thanked Providence that"
6874,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,I was to be left in peace. But I was curious to know where the doolies
6875,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,had gone. I got out of bed and looked into the darkness. There was never
6876,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"a sign of a doolie. Just as I was getting into bed again, I heard,"
6877,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"in the next room, the sound that no man in his senses can possibly"
6878,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,mistake--the whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when
6879,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,the striker is stringing for break. No other sound is like it. A
6880,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"minute afterwards there was another whir, and I got into bed. I was not"
6881,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,frightened--indeed I was not. I was very curious to know what had become
6882,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,of the doolies. I jumped into bed for that reason.
6883,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6884,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up. It
6885,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,is a mistake to say that hair stands up. The skin of the head tightens
6886,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"and you can feel a faint, prickly, bristling all over the scalp. That is"
6887,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,the hair sitting up.
6888,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6889,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"There was a whir and a click, and both sounds could only have been made"
6890,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,by one thing--a billiard ball. I argued the matter out at great length
6891,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,with myself; and the more I argued the less probable it seemed that one
6892,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"bed, one table, and two chairs--all the furniture of the room next to"
6893,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,mine--could so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards.
6894,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"After another cannon, a three--cushion one to judge by the whir, I"
6895,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,argued no more. I had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have
6896,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"escaped from that dak-bungalow. I listened, and with each listen the"
6897,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,game grew clearer.
6898,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6899,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,There was whir on whir and click on click. Sometimes there was a double
6900,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"click and a whir and another click. Beyond any sort of doubt, people"
6901,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,were playing billiards in the next room. And the next room was not big
6902,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,enough to hold a billiard table!
6903,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6904,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go forward--stroke
6905,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,after stroke. I tried to believe that I could not hear voices; but that
6906,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,attempt was a failure.
6907,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6908,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Do you know what fear is? Not ordinary fear of insult, injury or death,"
6909,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"but abject, quivering dread of something that you cannot see--fear that"
6910,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throat--fear that makes
6911,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"you sweat on the palms of the hands, and gulp in order to keep the uvula"
6912,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"at work? This is a fine Fear--a great cowardice, and must be felt to"
6913,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,be appreciated. The very improbability of billiards in a dak-bungalow
6914,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,proved the reality of the thing. No man--drunk or sober--could imagine a
6915,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"game at billiards, or invent the spitting crack of a ""screw-cannon."""
6916,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6917,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,A severe course of dak-bungalows has this disadvantage--it
6918,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,breeds infinite credulity. If a man said to a confirmed
6919,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"dak-bungalow-haunter:--""There is a corpse in the next room, and there's"
6920,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"a mad girl in the next but one, and the woman and man on that camel"
6921,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"have just eloped from a place sixty miles away,"" the hearer would not"
6922,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild, grotesque, or"
6923,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,horrible to happen in a dak-bungalow.
6924,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6925,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"This credulity, unfortunately, extends to ghosts. A rational person"
6926,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept. I
6927,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,did not. So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores
6928,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart, so"
6929,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,surely did I hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the
6930,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,echoing room behind the iron-barred door. My dominant fear was that the
6931,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,players might want a marker. It was an absurd fear; because creatures
6932,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities. I only
6933,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,know that that was my terror; and it was real.
6934,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6935,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"After a long, long while the game stopped, and the door banged. I slept"
6936,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,because I was dead tired. Otherwise I should have preferred to have kept
6937,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,awake. Not for everything in Asia would I have dropped the door-bar and
6938,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,peered into the dark of the next room.
6939,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6940,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"When the morning came, I considered that I had done well and wisely, and"
6941,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,inquired for the means of departure.
6942,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6943,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""By the way, khansamah,"" I said, ""what were those three doolies doing in"
6944,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"my compound in the night?"""
6945,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6946,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""There were no doolies,"" said the khansamah."
6947,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6948,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,I went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open
6949,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"door. I was immensely brave. I would, at that hour, have played Black"
6950,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Pool with the owner of the big Black Pool down below.
6951,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6952,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""Has this place always been a dak-bungalow?"" I asked."
6953,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6954,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""No,"" said the khansamah. ""Ten or twenty years ago, I have forgotten how"
6955,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"long, it was a billiard room."""
6956,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6957,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""A how much?"""
6958,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6959,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""A billiard room for the Sahibs who built the Railway. I was khansamah"
6960,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"then in the big house where all the Railway-Sahibs lived, and I used to"
6961,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"come across with brandy-shrab. These three rooms were all one, and"
6962,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,they held a big table on which the Sahibs played every evening. But
6963,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"the Sahibs are all dead now, and the Railway runs, you say, nearly to"
6964,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Kabul."""
6965,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6966,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""Do you remember anything about the Sahibs?"""
6967,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6968,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""It is long ago, but I remember that one Sahib, a fat man and always"
6969,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"angry, was playing here one night, and he said to me:--'Mangal Khan,"
6970,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"brandy-pani do,' and I filled the glass, and he bent over the table to"
6971,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"strike, and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table, and his"
6972,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"spectacles came off, and when we--the Sahibs and I myself--ran to lift"
6973,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"him he was dead. I helped to carry him out. Aha, he was a strong Sahib!"
6974,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"But he is dead and I, old Mangal Khan, am still living, by your favor."""
6975,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6976,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"That was more than enough! I had my ghost--a firsthand, authenticated"
6977,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,article. I would write to the Society for Psychical Research--I would
6978,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"paralyze the Empire with the news! But I would, first of all, put eighty"
6979,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dak-bungalow before
6980,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,nightfall. The Society might send their regular agent to investigate
6981,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,later on.
6982,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6983,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,I went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts
6984,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"of the case. As I smoked I heard the game begin again,--with a miss in"
6985,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"balk this time, for the whir was a short one."
6986,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6987,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,The door was open and I could see into the room. Click--click! That was
6988,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"a cannon. I entered the room without fear, for there was sunlight within"
6989,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,and a fresh breeze without. The unseen game was going on at a tremendous
6990,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"rate. And well it might, when a restless little rat was running to and"
6991,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"fro inside the dingy ceiling-cloth, and a piece of loose window-sash was"
6992,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,making fifty breaks off the window-bolt as it shook in the breeze!
6993,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6994,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake
6995,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when I
6996,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast
6997,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,game.
6998,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
6999,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows, Kadir Baksh."
7000,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
7001,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""This bungalow is very bad and low-caste! No wonder the Presence was"
7002,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,disturbed and is speckled. Three sets of doolie-bearers came to the
7003,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"bungalow late last night when I was sleeping outside, and said that it"
7004,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the English people!
7005,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"What honor has the khansamah? They tried to enter, but I told them to"
7006,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"go. No wonder, if these Oorias have been here, that the Presence is"
7007,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"sorely spotted. It is shame, and the work of a dirty man!"""
7008,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
7009,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Kadir Baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for
7010,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"rent in advance, and then, beyond my earshot, had beaten them with the"
7011,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,big green umbrella whose use I could never before divine. But Kadir
7012,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Baksh has no notions of morality.
7013,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
7014,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"There was an interview with the khansamah, but as he promptly lost his"
7015,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"head, wrath gave place to pity, and pity led to a long conversation,"
7016,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,in the course of which he put the fat Engineer-Sahib's tragic death in
7017,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,three separate stations--two of them fifty miles away. The third shift
7018,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"was to Calcutta, and there the Sahib died while driving a dogcart."
7019,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
7020,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,If I had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through
7021,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,Bengal with his corpse.
7022,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
7023,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"I did not go away as soon as I intended. I stayed for the night, while"
7024,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,the wind and the rat and the sash and the window-bolt played a ding-dong
7025,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"""hundred and fifty up."" Then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped,"
7026,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"and I felt that I had ruined my one genuine, hall-marked ghost story."
7027,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,
7028,MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY,"Had I only stopped at the proper time, I could have made anything out of"

7052,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"but take refuge in the waterless sands), and drive sumptuous C-spring"
7053,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"barouches, and buy beautiful girls and decorate their palaces with gold"
7054,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and ivory and Minton tiles and mother-of-pearl, I do not see why Jukes's"
7055,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"tale should not be true. He is a Civil Engineer, with a head for plans"
7056,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and distances and things of that kind, and he certainly would not take"
7057,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the trouble to invent imaginary traps. He could earn more by doing his
7058,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"legitimate work. He never varies the tale in the telling, and grows"
7059,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,very hot and indignant when he thinks of the disrespectful treatment
7060,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"he received. He wrote this quite straightforwardly at first, but he has"
7061,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"since touched it up in places and introduced Moral Reflections, thus:"
7062,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7063,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,In the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever. My work
7064,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,necessitated my being in camp for some months between Pakpattan and
7065,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Muharakpur--a desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had
7066,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the misfortune to go there may know. My coolies were neither more nor
7067,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"less exasperating than other gangs, and my work demanded sufficient"
7068,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"attention to keep me from moping, had I been inclined to so unmanly a"
7069,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,weakness.
7070,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7071,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"On the 23d December, 1884, I felt a little feverish. There was a full"
7072,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"moon at the time, and, in consequence, every dog near my tent was baying"
7073,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,it. The brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic. A few
7074,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,days previously I had shot one loud-mouthed singer and suspended his
7075,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,carcass in terrorem about fifty yards from my tent-door. But his friends
7076,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"fell upon, fought for, and ultimately devoured the body; and, as it"
7077,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"seemed to me, sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed"
7078,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,energy.
7079,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7080,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The light-heartedness which accompanies fever acts differently on
7081,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"different men. My irritation gave way, after a short time, to a fixed"
7082,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been
7083,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening. Thanks to
7084,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,a shaking hand and a giddy head I had already missed him twice with both
7085,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"barrels of my shot-gun, when it struck me that my best plan would be to"
7086,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hog-spear. This, of"
7087,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"course, was merely the semi-delirious notion of a fever patient; but I"
7088,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and
7089,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,feasible.
7090,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7091,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I therefore ordered my groom to saddle Pornic and bring him round
7092,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"quietly to the rear of my tent. When the pony was ready, I stood at his"
7093,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,head prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift
7094,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"up his voice. Pornic, by the way, had not been out of his pickets for a"
7095,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,couple of days; the night air was crisp and chilly; and I was armed
7096,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,with a specially long and sharp pair of persuaders with which I had been
7097,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon. You will easily believe, then,"
7098,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"that when he was let go he went quickly. In one moment, for the brute"
7099,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"bolted as straight as a die, the tent was left far behind, and we were"
7100,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed.
7101,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7102,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"In another we had passed the wretched dog, and I had almost forgotten"
7103,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,why it was that I had taken the horse and hogspear.
7104,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7105,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the
7106,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,air must have taken away the remnant of my senses. I have a faint
7107,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"recollection of standing upright in my stirrups, and of brandishing my"
7108,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,hog-spear at the great white Moon that looked down so calmly on my mad
7109,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,gallop; and of shouting challenges to the camel-thorn bushes as they
7110,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"whizzed past. Once or twice I believe, I swayed forward on Pornic's"
7111,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"neck, and literally hung on by my spurs--as the marks next morning"
7112,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,showed.
7113,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7114,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"The wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed, over what seemed"
7115,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand. Next, I remember, the ground"
7116,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"rose suddenly in front of us, and as we topped the ascent I saw the"
7117,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,waters of the Sutlej shining like a silver bar below. Then Pornic
7118,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"blundered heavily on his nose, and we rolled together down some unseen"
7119,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,slope.
7120,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7121,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I must have lost consciousness, for when I recovered I was lying on"
7122,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"my stomach in a heap of soft white sand, and the dawn was beginning to"
7123,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,break dimly over the edge of the slope down which I had fallen. As
7124,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the light grew stronger I saw that I was at the bottom of a horse-shoe
7125,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"shaped crater of sand, opening on one side directly on to the shoals of"
7126,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the Sutlej. My fever had altogether left me, and, with the exception of"
7127,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"a slight dizziness in the head, I felt no had effects from the fall over"
7128,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,night.
7129,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7130,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Pornic, who was standing a few yards away, was naturally a good deal"
7131,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"exhausted, but had not hurt himself in the least. His saddle, a favorite"
7132,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"polo one, was much knocked about, and had been twisted under his belly."
7133,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"It took me some time to put him to rights, and in the meantime I had"
7134,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,ample opportunities of observing the spot into which I had so foolishly
7135,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,dropped.
7136,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7137,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"At the risk of being considered tedious, I must describe it at length:"
7138,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of
7139,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows.
7140,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7141,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Imagine then, as I have said before, a horseshoe-shaped crater of sand"
7142,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"with steeply graded sand walls about thirty-five feet high. (The slope,"
7143,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I fancy, must have been about 65 degrees.) This crater enclosed a level"
7144,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part,"
7145,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"with a crude well in the centre. Round the bottom of the crater,"
7146,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"about three feet from the level of the ground proper, ran a series of"
7147,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"eighty-three semi-circular ovoid, square, and multilateral holes, all"
7148,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,about three feet at the mouth. Each hole on inspection showed that it
7149,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"was carefully shored internally with drift-wood and bamboos, and over"
7150,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the mouth a wooden drip-board projected, like the peak of a jockey's"
7151,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"cap, for two feet. No sign of life was visible in these tunnels, but a"
7152,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatre--a stench fouler
7153,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,than any which my wanderings in Indian villages have introduced me to.
7154,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7155,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Having remounted Pornic, who was as anxious as I to get back to camp, I"
7156,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit
7157,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"would be practicable. The inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not"
7158,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"thought fit to put in an appearance, so I was left to my own devices. My"
7159,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"first attempt to ""rush"" Pornic up the steep sand-banks showed me that"
7160,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the
7161,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,ant-lion sets for its prey. At each step the shifting sand poured down
7162,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"from above in tons, and rattled on the drip-boards of the holes like"
7163,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,small shot. A couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to
7164,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the bottom, half choked with the torrents of sand; and I was constrained"
7165,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,to turn my attention to the river-bank.
7166,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7167,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Here everything seemed easy enough. The sand hills ran down to the river
7168,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"edge, it is true, but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across"
7169,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"which I could gallop Pornic, and find my way back to terra firma by"
7170,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,turning sharply to the right or left. As I led Pornic over the sands I
7171,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,was startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river; and at the
7172,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"same moment a bullet dropped with a sharp ""whit"" close to Pornic's head."
7173,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7174,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,There was no mistaking the nature of the missile-a regulation
7175,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Martini-Henry ""picket."" About five hundred yards away a country-boat was"
7176,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,anchored in midstream; and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in
7177,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come.
7178,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse? The treacherous
7179,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,sand slope allowed no escape from a spot which I had visited most
7180,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"involuntarily, and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for"
7181,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,a bombardment from some insane native in a boat. I'm afraid that I lost
7182,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,my temper very much indeed.
7183,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7184,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Another bullet reminded me that I had better save my breath to cool
7185,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,my porridge; and I retreated hastily up the sands and back to the
7186,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"horseshoe, where I saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixty-five"
7187,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,human beings from the badger-holes which I had up till that point
7188,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,supposed to be untenanted. I found myself in the midst of a crowd of
7189,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"spectators--about forty men, twenty women, and one child who could not"
7190,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,have been more than five years old. They were all scantily clothed in
7191,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"that salmon-colored cloth which one associates with Hindu mendicants,"
7192,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and, at first sight, gave me the impression of a band of loathsome"
7193,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,fakirs. The filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond
7194,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"all description, and I shuddered to think what their life in the"
7195,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,badger-holes must be.
7196,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7197,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Even in these days, when local self government has destroyed the greater"
7198,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"part of a native's respect for a Sahib, I have been accustomed to a"
7199,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"certain amount of civility from my inferiors, and on approaching the"
7200,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,crowd naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my
7201,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,presence. As a matter of fact there was; but it was by no means what I
7202,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,had looked for.
7203,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7204,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The ragged crew actually laughed at me--such laughter I hope I may never
7205,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"hear again. They cackled, yelled, whistled, and howled as I walked into"
7206,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,their midst; some of them literally throwing themselves down on the
7207,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,ground in convulsions of unholy mirth. In a moment I had let go Pornic's
7208,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"head, and irritated beyond expression at the morning's adventure,"
7209,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force I could. The
7210,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"wretches dropped under my blows like nine-pins, and the laughter gave"
7211,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,place to wails for mercy; while those yet untouched clasped me round the
7212,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"knees, imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them."
7213,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7214,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"In the tumult, and just when I was feeling very much ashamed of myself"
7215,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"for having thus easily given way to my temper, a thin, high voice"
7216,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"murmured in English from behind my shoulder: ""--Sahib! Sahib! Do you not"
7217,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"know me? Sahib, it is Gunga Dass, the telegraph-master."""
7218,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7219,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I spun round quickly and faced the speaker.
7220,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7221,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass, (I have, of course, no hesitation in mentioning the man's"
7222,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,real name) I had known four years before as a Deccanee Brahmin loaned by
7223,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the Punjab Government to one of the Khalsia States. He was in charge
7224,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"of a branch telegraph-office there, and when I had last met him was"
7225,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"a jovial, full-stomached, portly Government servant with a marvelous"
7226,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,capacity for making had puns in English--a peculiarity which made
7227,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,me remember him long after I had forgotten his services to me in his
7228,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,official capacity. It is seldom that a Hindu makes English puns.
7229,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7230,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Now, however, the man was changed beyond all recognition. Caste-mark,"
7231,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"stomach, slate-colored continuations, and unctuous speech were all gone."
7232,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I looked at a withered skeleton, turban-less and almost naked, with long"
7233,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,matted hair and deep-set codfish-eyes.
7234,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7235,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,But for a crescent-shaped scar on the left cheek--the result of an
7236,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,accident for which I was responsible I should never have known him.
7237,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"But it was indubitably Gunga Dass, and--for this I was thankful--an"
7238,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,English-speaking native who might at least tell me the meaning of all
7239,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,that I had gone through that day.
7240,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7241,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The crowd retreated to some distance as I turned toward the miserable
7242,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"figure, and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the"
7243,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"crate. He held a freshly plucked crow in his hand, and in reply to my"
7244,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,question climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of
7245,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the holes, and commenced lighting a fire there in silence. Dried bents,"
7246,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"sand-poppies, and driftwood burn quickly; and I derived much consolation"
7247,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,from the fact that he lit them with an ordinary sulphur-match. When they
7248,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"were in a bright glow, and the crow was neatly spitted in front thereof,"
7249,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Gunga Dass began without a word of preamble:
7250,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7251,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""There are only two kinds of men, Sar. The alive and the dead. When you"
7252,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"are dead you are dead, but when you are alive you live."" (Here the crow"
7253,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in
7254,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"danger of being burned to a cinder.) ""If you die at home and do not die"
7255,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"when you come to the ghat to be burned you come here."""
7256,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7257,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"The nature of the reeking village was made plain now, and all that I had"
7258,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact
7259,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"just communicated by the ex-Brahmin. Sixteen years ago, when I first"
7260,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"landed in Bombay, I had been told by a wandering Armenian of the"
7261,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"existence, somewhere in India, of a place to which such Hindus as had"
7262,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the misfortune to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and
7263,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"kept, and I recollect laughing heartily at what I was then pleased to"
7264,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,consider a traveler's tale.
7265,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7266,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Sitting at the bottom of the sand-trap, the memory of Watson's Hotel,"
7267,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"with its swinging punkahs, white-robed attendants, and the sallow-faced"
7268,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Armenian, rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph, and I burst"
7269,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,into a loud fit of laughter. The contrast was too absurd!
7270,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7271,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass, as he bent over the unclean bird, watched me curiously."
7272,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Hindus seldom laugh, and his surroundings were not such as to move Gunga"
7273,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Dass to any undue excess of hilarity. He removed the crow solemnly
7274,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,from the wooden spit and as solemnly devoured it. Then he continued his
7275,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"story, which I give in his own words:"
7276,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7277,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""In epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before"
7278,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"you are dead. When you come to the riverside the cold air, perhaps,"
7279,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"makes you alive, and then, if you are only little alive, mud is put on"
7280,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,your nose and mouth and you die conclusively. If you are rather more
7281,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"alive, more mud is put; but if you are too lively they let you go"
7282,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and take you away. I was too lively, and made protestation with anger"
7283,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me. In those
7284,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,days I was Brahmin and proud man.
7285,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7286,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Now I am dead man and eat""--here he eyed the well-gnawed breast"
7287,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,bone with the first sign of emotion that I had seen in him since we
7288,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"met--""crows, and other things. They took me from my sheets when they saw"
7289,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"that I was too lively and gave me medicines for one week, and I survived"
7290,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"successfully. Then they sent me by rail from my place to Okara Station,"
7291,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,with a man to take care of me; and at Okara Station we met two other
7292,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"men, and they conducted we three on camels, in the night, from Okara"

7307,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"unspoken thought almost as soon as it was formed; and, to my intense"
7308,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"astonishment, gave vent to a long low chuckle of derision--the laughter,"

7314,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7315,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which I had in vain
7316,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,attempted to strive against overmastered me completely. My long fast--it
7317,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"was now close upon ten o'clock, and I had eaten nothing since tiffin on"
7318,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the previous day--combined with the violent and unnatural agitation of
7319,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the ride had exhausted me, and I verily believe that, for a few minutes,"
7320,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I acted as one mad. I hurled myself against the pitiless sand-slope. I
7321,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"ran round the base of the crater, blaspheming and praying by turns. I"
7322,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"crawled out among the sedges of the river-front, only to be driven back"
7323,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,each time in an agony of nervous dread by the rifle-bullets which cut
7324,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,up the sand round me--for I dared not face the death of a mad dog among
7325,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"that hideous crowd--and finally fell, spent and raving, at the curb of"
7326,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the well. No one had taken the slightest notion of an exhibition which
7327,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,makes me blush hotly even when I think of it now.
7328,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7329,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water, but they"
7330,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"were evidently used to this sort of thing, and had no time to waste"
7331,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"upon me. The situation was humiliating. Gunga Dass, indeed, when he had"
7332,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"banked the embers of his fire with sand, was at some pains to throw half"
7333,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"a cupful of fetid water over my head, an attention for which I could"
7334,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"have fallen on my knees and thanked him, but he was laughing all the"
7335,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"while in the same mirthless, wheezy key that greeted me on my first"
7336,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"attempt to force the shoals. And so, in a semi-comatose condition, I lay"
7337,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,till noon.
7338,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7339,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Then, being only a man after all, I felt hungry, and intimated as much"
7340,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"to Gunga Dass, whom I had begun to regard as my natural protector."
7341,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives, I"
7342,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas. The absurdity of the
7343,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"gift struck me at once, and I was about to replace the money."
7344,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7345,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass, however, was of a different opinion. ""Give me the money,"""
7346,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"said he; ""all you have, or I will get help, and we will kill you!"" All"
7347,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,this as if it were the most natural thing in the world!
7348,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7349,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"A Briton's first impulse, I believe, is to guard the contents of his"
7350,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,pockets; but a moment's reflection convinced me of the futility
7351,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,of differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me
7352,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,comfortable; and with whose help it was possible that I might eventually
7353,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"escape from the crater. I gave him all the money in my possession, Rs."
7354,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,9-8-5--nine rupees eight annas and five pie--for I always keep small
7355,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"change as bakshish when I am in camp. Gunga Dass clutched the coins, and"
7356,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"hid them at once in his ragged loin cloth, his expression changing to"
7357,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,something diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one
7358,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,had observed us.
7359,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7360,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Now I will give you something to eat,"" said he."
7361,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7362,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,What pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him I am
7363,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,unable to say; but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight I was not
7364,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"sorry that I had parted with it so readily, for I had no doubt that he"
7365,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,would have had me killed if I had refused. One does not protest against
7366,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the vagaries of a den of wild beasts; and my companions were lower than
7367,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"any beasts. While I devoured what Gunga Dass had provided, a coarse"
7368,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"chapatti and a cupful of the foul well-water, the people showed not the"
7369,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"faintest sign of curiosity--that curiosity which is so rampant, as a"
7370,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"rule, in an Indian village."
7371,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7372,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I could even fancy that they despised me. At all events they treated me
7373,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"with the most chilling indifference, and Gunga Dass was nearly as bad."
7374,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I plied him with questions about the terrible village, and received"
7375,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"extremely unsatisfactory answers. So far as I could gather, it had been"
7376,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,in existence from time immemorial--whence I concluded that it was at
7377,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,least a century old--and during that time no one had ever been known to
7378,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"escape from it. [I had to control myself here with both hands, lest the"
7379,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving
7380,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,round the crater.] Gunga Dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing
7381,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,this point and in watching me wince. Nothing that I could do would
7382,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"induce him to tell me who the mysterious ""They"" were."
7383,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7384,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""It is so ordered,"" he would reply, ""and I do not yet know any one who"
7385,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"has disobeyed the orders."""
7386,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7387,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Only wait till my servants find that I am missing,"" I retorted, ""and I"
7388,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth,"
7389,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and I'll give you a lesson in civility, too, my friend."""
7390,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7391,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place;"
7392,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and, besides, you are dead, my dear friend. It is not your fault, of"
7393,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"course, but none the less you are dead and buried."""
7394,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7395,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"At irregular intervals supplies of food, I was told, were dropped down"
7396,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"from the land side into the amphitheatre, and the inhabitants fought for"
7397,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,them like wild beasts. When a man felt his death coming on he retreated
7398,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,to his lair and died there. The body was sometimes dragged out of the
7399,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"hole and thrown on to the sand, or allowed to rot where it lay."
7400,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7401,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"The phrase ""thrown on to the sand"" caught my attention, and I asked"
7402,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Gunga Dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a
7403,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,pestilence.
7404,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7405,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""That,"" said he, with another of his wheezy chuckles, ""you may see for"
7406,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"yourself subsequently. You will have much time to make observations."""
7407,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7408,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Whereat, to his great delight, I winced once more and hastily continued"
7409,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the conversation:--""And how do you live here from day to day? What do"
7410,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"you do?"" The question elicited exactly the same answer as before coupled"
7411,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"with the information that ""this place is like your European heaven;"
7412,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage."""
7413,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7414,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass had been educated at a Mission School, and, as he himself"
7415,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"admitted, had he only changed his religion ""like a wise man,"" might have"
7416,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,avoided the living grave which was now his portion. But as long as I was
7417,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,with him I fancy he was happy.
7418,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7419,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Here was a Sahib, a representative of the dominant race, helpless as"
7420,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,a child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors. In a
7421,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,deliberate lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would
7422,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,devote a rapturous half-hour to watching the agonies of an impaled
7423,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"beetle, or as a ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably"
7424,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,to the neck of a rabbit. The burden of his conversation was that there
7425,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"was no escape ""of no kind whatever,"" and that I should stay here till I"
7426,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"died and was ""thrown on to the sand."" If it were possible to forejudge"
7427,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the conversation of the Damned on the advent of a new soul in their
7428,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"abode, I should say that they would speak as Gunga Dass did to me"
7429,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,throughout that long afternoon. I was powerless to protest or answer;
7430,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,all my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable
7431,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,terror that threatened to overwhelm me again and again. I can compare
7432,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the feeling to nothing except the struggles of a man against the
7433,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,overpowering nausea of the Channel passage--only my agony was of the
7434,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,spirit and infinitely more terrible.
7435,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7436,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"As the day wore on, the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to"
7437,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"catch the rays of the afternoon sun, which were now sloping in at the"
7438,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"mouth of the crater. They assembled in little knots, and talked among"
7439,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction. About four
7440,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"o'clock, as far as I could judge Gunga Dass rose and dived into his lair"
7441,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"for a moment, emerging with a live crow in his hands. The wretched bird"
7442,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"was in a most draggled and deplorable condition, but seemed to be in no"
7443,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"way afraid of its master, Advancing cautiously to the river front, Gunga"
7444,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch
7445,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,of sand directly in the line of the boat's fire. The occupants of the
7446,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"boat took no notice. Here he stopped, and, with a couple of dexterous"
7447,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"turns of the wrist, pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings."
7448,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"As was only natural, the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air"
7449,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,with its claws. In a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention
7450,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away, where they"
7451,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,were discussing something that looked like a corpse. Half a dozen crows
7452,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"flew over at once to see what was going on, and also, as it proved, to"
7453,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"attack the pinioned bird. Gunga Dass, who had lain down on a tussock,"
7454,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"motioned to me to be quiet, though I fancy this was a needless"
7455,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"precaution. In a moment, and before I could see how it happened, a"
7456,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"wild crow, who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird, was"
7457,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"entangled in the latter's claws, swiftly disengaged by Gunga Dass, and"
7458,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"pegged down beside its companion in adversity. Curiosity, it seemed,"
7459,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"overpowered the rest of the flock, and almost before Gunga Dass and I"
7460,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"had time to withdraw to the tussock, two more captives were struggling"
7461,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,in the upturned claws of the decoys. So the chase--if I can give it so
7462,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,dignified a name--continued until Gunga Dass had captured seven crows.
7463,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Five of them he throttled at once, reserving two for further operations"
7464,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"another day. I was a good deal impressed by this, to me, novel method of"
7465,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"securing food, and complimented Gunga Dass on his skill."
7466,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7467,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""It is nothing to do,"" said he. ""Tomorrow you must do it for me. You are"
7468,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"stronger than I am."""
7469,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7470,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"This calm assumption of superiority Upset me not a little, and I"
7471,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"answered peremptorily;--""Indeed, you old ruffian! What do you think I"
7472,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"have given you money for?"""
7473,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7474,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Very well,"" was the unmoved reply. ""Perhaps not tomorrow, nor the day"
7475,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"after, nor subsequently; but in the end, and for many years, you will"
7476,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"catch crows and eat crows, and you will thank your European God that you"
7477,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"have crows to catch and eat."""
7478,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7479,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I could have cheerfully strangled him for this; but judged it best under
7480,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the circumstances to smother my resentment. An hour later I was eating
7481,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"one of the crows; and, as Gunga Dass had said, thanking my God that I"
7482,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,had a crow to eat. Never as long as I live shall I forget that evening
7483,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,meal. The whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform
7484,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"opposite their dens, huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes."
7485,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Death, having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike,"
7486,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,seemed to stand aloof from them now; for most of our company were
7487,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"old men, bent and worn and twisted with years, and women aged to all"
7488,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,appearance as the Fates themselves. They sat together in knots and
7489,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"talked--God only knows what they found to discuss--in low equable tones,"
7490,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are
7491,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,accustomed to make day hideous. Now and then an access of that sudden
7492,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,fury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or
7493,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,woman; and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the
7494,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"steep slope until, baffled and bleeding, he fell back on the platform"
7495,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,incapable of moving a limb. The others would never even raise their
7496,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"eyes when this happened, as men too well aware of the futility of their"
7497,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,fellows' attempts and wearied with their useless repetition. I saw four
7498,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,such outbursts in the course of the evening.
7499,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7500,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass took an eminently business-like view of my situation, and"
7501,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"while we were dining--I can afford to laugh at the recollection now, but"
7502,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,it was painful enough at the time-propounded the terms on which he would
7503,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"consent to ""do"" for me. My nine rupees eight annas, he argued, at the"
7504,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"rate of three annas a day, would provide me with food for fifty-one"
7505,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"days, or about seven weeks; that is to say, he would be willing to cater"
7506,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,for me for that length of time. At the end of it I was to look after
7507,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,myself. For a further consideration--videlicet my boots--he would be
7508,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own, and would supply"
7509,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare.
7510,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7511,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Very well, Gunga Dass,"" I replied; ""to the first terms I cheerfully"
7512,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"agree, but, as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as"
7513,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"you sit here and taking everything that you have"" (I thought of the two"
7514,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"invaluable crows at the time), ""I flatly refuse to give you my boots and"
7515,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"shall take whichever den I please."""
7516,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7517,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"The stroke was a bold one, and I was glad when I saw that it had"
7518,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"succeeded. Gunga Dass changed his tone immediately, and disavowed all"
7519,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,intention of asking for my boots. At the time it did not strike me as at
7520,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"all strange that I, a Civil Engineer, a man of thirteen years' standing"
7521,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"in the Service, and, I trust, an average Englishman, should thus"
7522,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"calmly threaten murder and violence against the man who had, for a"
7523,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"consideration it is true, taken me under his wing. I had left the world,"
7524,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"it seemed, for centuries. I was as certain then as I am now of my own"
7525,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"existence, that in the accursed settlement there was no law save that"
7526,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,of the strongest; that the living dead men had thrown behind them every
7527,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,canon of the world which had cast them out; and that I had to depend
7528,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,for my own life on my strength and vigilance alone. The crew of the
7529,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,ill-fated Mignonette are the only men who would understand my frame of
7530,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"mind. ""At present,"" I argued to myself, ""I am strong and a match for six"
7531,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"of these wretches. It is imperatively necessary that I should, for my"
7532,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"own sake, keep both health and strength until the hour of my release"
7533,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"comes--if it ever does."""
7534,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7535,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Fortified with these resolutions, I ate and drank as much as I could,"
7536,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and made Gunga Dass understand that I intended to be his master, and"
7537,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,that the least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with
7538,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the only punishment I had it in my power to inflict--sudden and violent
7539,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,death. Shortly after this I went to bed.
7540,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7541,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"That is to say, Gunga Dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which"
7542,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his, and followed"
7543,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"myself, feet foremost; the hole running about nine feet into the"
7544,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"sand with a slight downward inclination, and being neatly shored with"
7545,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"timbers. From my den, which faced the river-front, I was able to watch"
7546,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the waters of the Sutlej flowing past under the light of a young moon
7547,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,and compose myself to sleep as best I might.
7548,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7549,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The horrors of that night I shall never forget. My den was nearly as
7550,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"narrow as a coffin, and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by"
7551,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the contact of innumerable naked bodies, added to which it smelled"
7552,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,abominably. Sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited
7553,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"frame of mind. As the night wore on, it seemed that the entire"
7554,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"amphitheatre was filled with legions of unclean devils that, trooping up"
7555,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"from the shoals below, mocked the unfortunates in their lairs."
7556,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7557,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Personally I am not of an imaginative temperament,--very few Engineers"
7558,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"are,--but on that occasion I was as completely prostrated with nervous"
7559,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"terror as any woman. After half an hour or so, however, I was able once"
7560,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,more to calmly review my chances of escape. Any exit by the steep sand
7561,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"walls was, of course, impracticable. I had been thoroughly convinced of"
7562,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"this some time before. It was possible, just possible, that I might, in"
7563,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the uncertain moonlight, safely run the gauntlet of the rifle shots. The"
7564,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,place was so full of terror for me that I was prepared to undergo
7565,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"any risk in leaving it. Imagine my delight, then, when after creeping"
7566,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,stealthily to the river-front I found that the infernal boat was not
7567,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,there. My freedom lay before me in the next few steps!
7568,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7569,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,By walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the
7570,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"projecting left horn of the horseshoe, I could wade across, turn"
7571,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the flank of the crater, and make my way inland. Without a moment's"
7572,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,hesitation I marched briskly past the tussocks where Gunga Dass had
7573,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"snared the crows, and out in the direction of the smooth white sand"
7574,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,beyond. My first step from the tufts of dried grass showed me how
7575,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"utterly futile was any hope of escape; for, as I put my foot down, I"
7576,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"felt an indescribable drawing, sucking motion of the sand below. Another"
7577,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee. In the moonlight
7578,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish delight
7579,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"at my disappointment. I struggled clear, sweating with terror and"
7580,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"exertion, back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face."
7581,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7582,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,My only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a
7583,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,quicksand!
7584,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7585,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,How long I lay I have not the faintest idea; but I was roused at last
7586,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"by the malevolent chuckle of Gunga Dass at my ear. ""I would advise you,"
7587,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Protector of the Poor"" (the ruffian was speaking English) ""to return to"
7588,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"your house. It is unhealthy to lie down here. Moreover, when the boat"
7589,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"returns, you will most certainly be rifled at."" He stood over me in the"
7590,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"dim light of the dawn, chuckling and laughing to himself. Suppressing"
7591,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,my first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the
7592,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"quicksand, I rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the"
7593,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,burrows.
7594,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7595,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Suddenly, and futilely as I thought while I spoke, I asked--""Gunga Dass,"
7596,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"what is the good of the boat if I can't get out anyhow?"" I recollect"
7597,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,that even in my deepest trouble I had been speculating vaguely on the
7598,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore.
7599,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7600,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass laughed again and made answer:--""They have the boat only in"
7601,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,daytime. It is for the reason that there is a way. I hope we shall have
7602,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the pleasure of your company for much longer time. It is a pleasant spot
7603,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough."""
7604,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7605,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I staggered, numbed and helpless, toward the fetid burrow allotted to"
7606,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"me, and fell asleep. An hour or so later I was awakened by a piercing"
7607,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"scream--the shrill, high-pitched scream of a horse in pain. Those who"
7608,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,have once heard that will never forget the sound. I found some little
7609,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"difficulty in scrambling out of the burrow. When I was in the open, I"
7610,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"saw Pornic, my poor old Pornic, lying dead on the sandy soil. How they"
7611,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,had killed him I cannot guess. Gunga Dass explained that horse was
7612,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"better than crow, and ""greatest good of greatest number is political"
7613,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"maxim. We are now Republic, Mister Jukes, and you are entitled to a fair"
7614,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"share of the beast. If you like, we will pass a vote of thanks. Shall I"
7615,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"propose?"""
7616,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7617,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Yes, we were a Republic indeed! A Republic of wild beasts penned at the"
7618,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"bottom of a pit, to eat and fight and sleep till we died. I attempted"
7619,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"no protest of any kind, but sat down and stared at the hideous sight"
7620,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"in front of me. In less time almost than it takes me to write this,"
7621,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Pornic's body was divided, in some unclear way or other; the men and"
7622,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,women had dragged the fragments on to the platform and were preparing
7623,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,their normal meal. Gunga Dass cooked mine. The almost irresistible
7624,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,impulse to fly at the sand walls until I was wearied laid hold of me
7625,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"afresh, and I had to struggle against it with all my might. Gunga Dass"
7626,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,was offensively jocular till I told him that if he addressed another
7627,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,remark of any kind whatever to me I should strangle him where he sat.
7628,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"This silenced him till silence became insupportable, and I bade him say"
7629,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,something.
7630,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7631,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""You will live here till you die like the other Feringhi,"" he said,"
7632,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"coolly, watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing."
7633,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7634,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""What other Sahib, you swine? Speak at once, and don't stop to tell me a"
7635,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"lie."""
7636,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7637,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""He is over there,"" answered Gunga Dass, pointing to a burrow-mouth"
7638,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"about four doors ta the left of my own. ""You can see for yourself. He"
7639,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"died in the burrow as you will die, and I will die, and as all these men"
7640,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and women and the one child will also die."""
7641,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7642,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""For pity's sake tell me all you know about him. Who was he? When did he"
7643,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"come, and when did he die?"""
7644,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7645,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,This appeal was a weak step on my part. Gunga Dass only leered and
7646,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"replied:--""I will not--unless you give me something first."""
7647,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7648,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Then I recollected where I was, and struck the man between the eyes,"
7649,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"partially stunning him. He stepped down from the platform at once, and,"
7650,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet, led"
7651,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,me round to the burrow which he had indicated.
7652,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7653,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""I know nothing whatever about the gentleman. Your God be my witness"
7654,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"that I do not. He was as anxious to escape as you were, and he was"
7655,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"shot from the boat, though we all did all things to prevent him from"
7656,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"attempting. He was shot here."" Gunga Dass laid his hand on his lean"
7657,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,stomach and bowed to the earth.
7658,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7659,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Well, and what then? Go on!"""
7660,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7661,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""And then--and then, Your Honor, we carried him in to his house and"
7662,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"gave him water, and put wet cloths on the wound, and he laid down in his"
7663,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"house and gave up the ghost."""
7664,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7665,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""In how long? In how long?"""
7666,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7667,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""About half an hour, after he received his wound. I call Vishnu to"
7668,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"witness,"" yelled the wretched man, ""that I did everything for him."
7669,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Everything which was possible, that I did!"""
7670,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7671,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,He threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles. But I had
7672,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"my doubts about Gunga Dass's benevolence, and kicked him off as he lay"
7673,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,protesting.
7674,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7675,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""I believe you robbed him of everything he had. But I can find out in a"
7676,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"minute or two. How long was the Sahib here?"""
7677,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7678,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Nearly a year and a half. I think he must have gone mad. But hear me"
7679,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"swear, Protector of the Poor! Won't Your Honor hear me swear that I"
7680,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,never touched an article that belonged to him? What is Your Worship
7681,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"going to do?"""
7682,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7683,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I had taken Gunga Dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the
7684,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,platform opposite the deserted burrow. As I did so I thought of my
7685,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,wretched fellow-prisoner's unspeakable misery among all these horrors
7686,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"for eighteen months, and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole,"
7687,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,with a bullet-wound in the stomach. Gunga Dass fancied I was going
7688,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"to kill him and howled pitifully. The rest of the population, in the"
7689,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"plethora that follows a full flesh meal, watched us without stirring."
7690,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7691,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Go inside, Gunga Dass,"" said I, ""and fetch it out."""
7692,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7693,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I was feeling sick and faint with horror now. Gunga Dass nearly rolled
7694,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,off the platform and howled aloud.
7695,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7696,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""But I am Brahmin, Sahib--a high-caste Brahmin. By your soul, by your"
7697,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"father's soul, do not make me do this thing!"""
7698,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7699,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my soul and my father's soul, in you go!"""
7700,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I said, and, seizing him by the shoulders, I crammed his head into"
7701,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the mouth of the burrow, kicked the rest of him in, and, sitting down,"
7702,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,covered my face with my hands.
7703,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7704,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,At the end of a few minutes I heard a rustle and a creak; then Gunga
7705,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Dass in a sobbing, choking whisper speaking to himself; then a soft"
7706,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,thud--and I uncovered my eyes.
7707,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7708,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a
7709,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,yellow-brown mummy. I told Gunga Dass to stand off while I examined it.
7710,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7711,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"The body--clad in an olive-green hunting-suit much stained and worn,"
7712,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,with leather pads on the shoulders--was that of a man between thirty and
7713,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"forty, above middle height, with light, sandy hair, long mustache, and a"
7714,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"rough unkempt beard. The left canine of the upper jaw was missing, and"
7715,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,a portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone. On the second finger of
7716,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the left hand was a ring--a shield-shaped bloodstone set in gold, with"
7717,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"a monogram that might have been either ""B.K."" or ""B.L."" On the third"
7718,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,finger of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled
7719,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"cobra, much worn and tarnished. Gunga Dass deposited a handful of"
7720,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my feet, and, covering the"
7721,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"face of the body with my handkerchief, I turned to examine these. I give"
7722,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the full list in the hope that it may lead to the identification of the
7723,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,unfortunate man:
7724,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7725,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"1. Bowl of a briarwood pipe, serrated at the edge; much worn and"
7726,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,blackened; bound with string at the crew.
7727,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7728,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,2. Two patent-lever keys; wards of both broken.
7729,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7730,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"3. Tortoise-shell-handled penknife, silver or nickel name-plate, marked"
7731,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"with monogram ""B.K."""
7732,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7733,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"4. Envelope, postmark Undecipherable, bearing a Victorian stamp,"
7734,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"addressed to ""Miss Mon-"" (rest illegible) -""ham-'nt."""
7735,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7736,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,5. Imitation crocodile-skin notebook with pencil. First forty-five pages
7737,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,blank; four and a half illegible; fifteen others filled with private
7738,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"memoranda relating chiefly to three persons--a Mrs. L. Singleton,"
7739,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"abbreviated several times to ""Lot Single,"" ""Mrs. S. May,"" and"
7740,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Garmison,"" referred to in places as ""Jerry"" or ""Jack."""
7741,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7742,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"6. Handle of small-sized hunting-knife. Blade snapped short. Buck's horn,"
7743,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"diamond cut, with swivel and ring on the butt; fragment of cotton cord"
7744,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,attached.
7745,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7746,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,It must not be supposed that I inventoried all these things on the spot
7747,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,as fully as I have here written them down. The notebook first attracted
7748,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"my attention, and I put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later"
7749,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,on.
7750,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7751,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"The rest of the articles I conveyed to my burrow for safety's sake, and"
7752,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"there being a methodical man, I inventoried them. I then returned to"
7753,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the corpse and ordered Gunga Dass to help me to carry it out to the
7754,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"river-front. While we were engaged in this, the exploded shell of an old"
7755,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet.
7756,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Gunga Dass had not seen it; and I fell to thinking that a man does not
7757,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"carry exploded cartridge-cases, especially ""browns,"" which will not"
7758,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"bear loading twice, about with him when shooting. In other words, that"
7759,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,cartridge-case had been fired inside the crater. Consequently there must
7760,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"be a gun somewhere. I was on the verge of asking Gunga Dass, but checked"
7761,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"myself, knowing that he would lie. We laid the body down on the edge of"
7762,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the quicksand by the tussocks. It was my intention to push it out and
7763,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,let it be swallowed up--the only possible mode of burial that I could
7764,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,think of. I ordered Gunga Dass to go away.
7765,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7766,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Then I gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand. In doing so--it
7767,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,was lying face downward--I tore the frail and rotten khaki shooting-coat
7768,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"open, disclosing a hideous cavity in the back. I have already told you"
7769,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"that the dry sand had, as it were, mummified the body. A moment's glance"
7770,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gun-shot wound; the
7771,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the back. The
7772,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"shooting-coat, being intact, had been drawn over the body after death,"
7773,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,which must have been instantaneous. The secret of the poor wretch's
7774,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"death was plain to me in a flash. Some one of the crater, presumably"
7775,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"Gunga Dass, must have shot him with his own gun--the gun that fitted the"
7776,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,brown cartridges. He had never attempted to escape in the face of the
7777,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,rifle-fire from the boat.
7778,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7779,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I pushed the corpse out hastily, and saw it sink from sight literally in"
7780,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"a few seconds. I shuddered as I watched. In a dazed, half-conscious way"
7781,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,I turned to peruse the notebook. A stained and discolored slip of paper
7782,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"bad been inserted between the binding and the back, and dropped out as I"
7783,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"opened the pages. This is what it contained:--""Four out from crow-clump:"
7784,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,three left; nine out; two right; three back; two left; fourteen out; two
7785,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,left; seven out; one left; nine back; two right; six back; four right;
7786,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"seven back."" The paper had been burned and charred at the edges. What it"
7787,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,meant I could not understand. I sat down on the dried bents turning
7788,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"it over and over between my fingers, until I was aware of Gunga Dass"
7789,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and outstretched hands.
7790,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7791,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Have you got it?"" he panted. ""Will you not let me look at it also? I"
7792,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"swear that I will return it."""
7793,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7794,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Got what? Return what?"" asked."
7795,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7796,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""That which you have in your hands. It will help us both."" He stretched"
7797,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"out his long, bird-like talons, trembling with eagerness."
7798,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7799,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""I could never find it,"" he continued. ""He had secreted it about his"
7800,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"person. Therefore I shot him, but nevertheless I was unable to obtain"
7801,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"it."""
7802,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7803,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Gunga Dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the
7804,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,rifle-bullet. I received the information perfectly calmly. Morality is
7805,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,blunted by consorting with the Dead who are alive.
7806,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7807,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""What on earth are you raving about? What is it you want me to give"
7808,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"you?"""
7809,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7810,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""The piece of paper in the notebook. It will help us both. Oh, you fool!"
7811,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"You fool! Can you not see what it will do for us? We shall escape!"""
7812,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7813,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"His voice rose almost to a scream, and he danced with excitement before"
7814,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,me. I own I was moved at the chance of my getting away.
7815,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7816,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Don't skip! Explain yourself. Do you mean to say that this slip of"
7817,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"paper will help us? What does it mean?"""
7818,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7819,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""Read it aloud! Read it aloud! I beg and I pray you to read it aloud."""
7820,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7821,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"I did so. Gunga Dass listened delightedly, and drew an irregular line in"
7822,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the sand with his fingers.
7823,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7824,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""See now! It was the length of his gun-barrels without the stock. I have"
7825,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,those barrels. Four gun-barrels out from the place where I caught crows
7826,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,straight out; do you follow me? Then three left--Ah! how well I remember
7827,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"when that man worked it out night after night Then nine out, and so on."
7828,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,Out is always straight before you across the quicksand. He told me so
7829,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"before I killed him."""
7830,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7831,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""But if you knew all this why didn't you get out before?"""
7832,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7833,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"""I did not know it. He told me that he was working it out a year and a"
7834,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"half ago, and how he was working it out night after night when the boat"
7835,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"had gone away, and he could get out near the quicksand safely. Then he"
7836,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,said that we would get away together. But I was afraid that he would
7837,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out, and so I shot"
7838,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"him. Besides, it is not advisable that the men who once get in here"
7839,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"should escape. Only I, and I am a Brahmin."""
7840,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7841,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,The prospect of escape had brought Gunga Dass's caste back to him. He
7842,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"stood up, walked about and gesticulated violently. Eventually I managed"
7843,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"to make him talk soberly, and he told me how this Englishman had spent"
7844,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"six months night after night in exploring, inch by inch, the passage"
7845,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,across the quicksand; how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up
7846,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,to within about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank
7847,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,of the left horn of the horseshoe. This much he had evidently not
7848,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,completed when Gunga Dass shot him with his own gun.
7849,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7850,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,In my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape I recollect
7851,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"shaking hands effusively with Gunga Dass, after we had decided that we"
7852,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,were to make an attempt to get away that very night. It was weary work
7853,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,waiting throughout the afternoon.
7854,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7855,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"About ten o'clock, as far as I could judge, when the Moon had just risen"
7856,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"above the lip of the crater, Gunga Dass made a move for his burrow to"
7857,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,bring out the gun-barrels whereby to measure our path. All the other
7858,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago. The guardian
7859,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"boat drifted downstream some hours before, and we were utterly alone by"
7860,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the crow-clump. Gunga Dass, while carrying the gun-barrels, let slip"
7861,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the piece of paper which was to be our guide. I stooped down hastily to
7862,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"recover it, and, as I did so, I was aware that the diabolical Brahmin"
7863,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gun-barrels.
7864,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,It was too late to turn round. I must have received the blow somewhere
7865,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,on the nape of my neck. A hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my
7866,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"eyes, and I fell forwards senseless at the edge of, the quicksand."
7867,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7868,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"When I recovered consciousness, the Moon was going down, and I was"
7869,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head. Gunga Dass had
7870,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,disappeared and my mouth was full of blood. I lay down again and prayed
7871,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,that I might die without more ado. Then the unreasoning fury which I had
7872,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"before mentioned, laid hold upon me, and I staggered inland toward the"
7873,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,walls of the crater. It seemed that some one was calling to me in a
7874,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"whisper--""Sahib! Sahib! Sahib!"" exactly as my bearer used to call me in"
7875,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,the morning I fancied that I was delirious until a handful of sand
7876,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,fell at my feet. Then I looked up and saw a head peering down into
7877,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the amphitheatre--the head of Dunnoo, my dog-boy, who attended to my"
7878,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"collies. As soon as he had attracted my attention, he held up his hand"
7879,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and showed a rope. I motioned, staggering to and fro for the while, that"
7880,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,he should throw it down. It was a couple of leather punkah-ropes knotted
7881,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"together, with a loop at one end. I slipped the loop over my head and"
7882,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,under my arms; heard Dunnoo urge something forward; was conscious that I
7883,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"was being dragged, face downward, up the steep sand slope, and the"
7884,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,next instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand
7885,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"hills overlooking the crater. Dunnoo, with his face ashy grey in the"
7886,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"moonlight, implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once."
7887,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7888,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,It seems that he had tracked Pornic's footprints fourteen miles across
7889,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"the sands to the crater; had returned and told my servants, who flatly"
7890,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"refused to meddle with any one, white or black, once fallen into the"
7891,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,hideous Village of the Dead; whereupon Dunnoo had taken one of my ponies
7892,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"and a couple of punkah-ropes, returned to the crater, and hauled me out"
7893,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,as I have described.
7894,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,
7895,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"To cut a long story short, Dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold"
7896,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,mohur a month--a sum which I still think far too little for the services
7897,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,he has rendered. Nothing on earth will induce me to go near that
7898,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"devilish spot again, or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than I"
7899,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"have done. Of Gunga Dass I have never found a trace, nor do I wish to"
7900,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,do. My sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some
7901,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"one may possibly identify, from the details and the inventory which I"
7902,THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES,"have given above, the corpse of the man in the olive-green hunting-suit."

7913,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"The Law, as quoted, lays down a fair conduct of life, and one not easy to"
7914,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,follow. I have been fellow to a beggar again and again under
7915,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other
7916,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was worthy. I have still to be brother to a Prince, though I once came"

7918,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"promised the reversion of a Kingdom--army, law-courts, revenue, and"

7920,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and if I want a crown I must go hunt it for myself.
7921,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
7922,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,The beginning of everything was in a railway-train upon the road to Mhow
7923,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"from Ajmir. There had been a Deficit in the Budget, which necessitated"
7924,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"travelling, not Second-class, which is only half as dear as First-Class,"
7925,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"but by Intermediate, which is very awful indeed. There are no cushions"
7926,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"in the Intermediate class, and the population are either Intermediate,"
7927,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"which is Eurasian, or native, which for a long night journey is nasty,"
7928,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"or Loafer, which is amusing though intoxicated. Intermediates do not buy"
7929,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"from refreshment-rooms. They carry their food in bundles and pots, and"
7930,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"buy sweets from the native sweetmeat-sellers, and drink the roadside"
7931,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,water. This is why in hot weather Intermediates are taken out of the
7932,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"carriages dead, and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon."
7933,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
7934,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,My particular Intermediate happened to be empty till I reached
7935,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Nasirabad, when the big black-browed gentleman in shirt-sleeves entered,"
7936,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and, following the custom of Intermediates, passed the time of day. He"
7937,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself, but with an educated"
7938,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"taste for whisky. He told tales of things he had seen and done, of"
7939,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"out-of-the-way corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated, and"
7940,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days' food.

7945,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"millions,"" said he; and as I looked at his mouth and chin I was disposed"
7946,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,to agree with him.
7947,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
7948,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"We talked politics,--the politics of Loaferdom that sees things from"
7949,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed off,--and we"
7950,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram
7951,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"back from the next station to Ajmir, the turning-off place from the"
7952,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Bombay to the Mhow line as you travel westward. My friend had no money
7953,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner, and I had no money at"
7954,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"all, owing to the hitch in the Budget before mentioned. Further, I was"
7955,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"going into a wilderness where, though I should resume touch with the"
7956,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Treasury, there were no telegraph offices. I was, therefore, unable to"

7959,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""We might threaten a Station-master, and make him send a wire on tick,"""

7980,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"you be at Marwar Junction on that time? 'T won't be inconveniencing you,"
7981,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,because I know that there's precious few pickings to be got out of these

7984,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,

7987,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Again and again, but the Residents find you out, and then you get"

7989,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,But about my friend here. I must give him a word o' mouth to tell him
7990,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"what's come to me, or else he won't know where to go. I would take it"
7991,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,more than kind of you if you was to come out of Central India in time to
7992,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"catch him at Marwar Junction, and say to him, 'He has gone South for the"
7993,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"week.' He'll know what that means. He's a big man with a red beard, and"

8008,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8009,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their

8025,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Thank you,"" said he, simply; ""and when will the swine be gone? I"
8026,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,can't starve because he's ruining my work. I wanted to get hold of the

8036,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8037,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He got out at a little roadside station, and I reflected. I had heard,"
8038,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"more than once, of men personating correspondents of newspapers and"
8039,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"bleeding small Native States with threats of exposure, but I had never"
8040,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"met any of the caste before. They lead a hard life, and generally die"
8041,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,with great suddenness. The Native States have a wholesome horror of
8042,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"English newspapers, which may throw light on their peculiar methods of"
8043,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"government, and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne,"
8044,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,or drive them out of their mind with four-in-hand barouches. They do not
8045,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration
8046,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,of Native States so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent
8047,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"limits, and the ruler is not drugged, drunk, or diseased from one end"
8048,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of the year to the other. They are the dark places of the earth, full"
8049,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of unimaginable cruelty, touching the Railway and the Telegraph on one"
8050,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"side, and, on the other, the days of Harun-al-Raschid. When I left the"
8051,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"train I did business with divers Kings, and in eight days passed through"
8052,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,many changes of life. Sometimes I wore dress-clothes and consorted with
8053,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Princes and Politicals, drinking from crystal and eating from silver."
8054,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Sometimes I lay out upon the ground and devoured what I could get, from"
8055,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a plate made of leaves, and drank the running water, and slept under the"
8056,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,same rug as my servant. It was all in the day's work.
8057,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8058,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Then I headed for the Great Indian Desert upon the proper date, as I"
8059,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"had promised, and the night Mail set me down at Marwar Junction, where"
8060,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a funny little, happy-go-lucky, native managed railway runs to Jodhpore."
8061,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,The Bombay Mail from Delhi makes a short halt at Marwar. She arrived
8062,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"just as I got in, and I had just time to hurry to her platform and go"
8063,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,down the carriages. There was only one Second-class on the train.
8064,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I slipped the window and looked down upon a flaming-red beard, half"
8065,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"covered by a railway-rug. That was my man, fast asleep, and I dug him"
8066,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,gently in the ribs.
8067,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8068,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He woke with a grunt, and I saw his face in the light of the lamps."
8069,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8070,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,It was a great and shining face.
8071,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8072,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Tickets again?"" said he."
8073,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8074,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""No,"" said I. ""I am to tell you that he is gone South for the week. He"
8075,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"has gone South for the week!"""
8076,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8077,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,The train had begun to move out. The red man rubbed his eyes.
8078,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8079,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""He has gone South for the week,"" he repeated. ""Now that's just like his"
8080,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"impidence. Did he say that I was to give you anything? 'Cause I won't."""
8081,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8082,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""He didn't,"" I said, and dropped away, and watched the red lights die"
8083,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,out in the dark. It was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off
8084,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the sands. I climbed into my own train--not an Intermediate carriage
8085,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,this time--and went to sleep.
8086,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8087,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,If the man with the beard had given me a rupee I should have kept it as
8088,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,a memento of a rather curious affair. But the consciousness of having
8089,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,done my duty was my only reward.
8090,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8091,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Later on I reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any
8092,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers,"
8093,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and might, if they blackmailed one of the little rat-trap States"
8094,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of Central India or Southern Rajputana, get themselves into serious"
8095,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,difficulties. I therefore took some trouble to describe them as
8096,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,accurately as I could remember to people who would be interested in
8097,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"deporting them; and succeeded, so I was later informed, in having them"
8098,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,headed back from the Degumber borders.
8099,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8100,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Then I became respectable, and returned to an office where there were no"
8101,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper. A
8102,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person, to"
8103,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the prejudice of discipline. Zenana-mission ladies arrive, and beg that"
8104,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the Editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a Christian
8105,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,prize-giving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village;
8106,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Colonels who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the
8107,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"outline of a series of ten, twelve, or twenty-four leading articles on"
8108,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Seniority versus Selection; missionaries wish to know why they have not
8109,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse, and swear"
8110,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,at a brother missionary under special patronage of the editorial We.
8111,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot pay
8112,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"for their advertisements, but on their return from New Zealand or Tahiti"
8113,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"will do so with interest; inventors of patent punka-pulling machines,"
8114,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"carriage couplings, and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with"
8115,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal; tea
8116,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens;
8117,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last
8118,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"dance more fully described; strange ladies rustle in and say, ""I want a"
8119,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"hundred lady's cards printed at once, please,"" which is manifestly part"
8120,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,of an Editor's duty; and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped
8121,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the Grand Trunk Road makes it his business to ask for employment as a
8122,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"proof-reader. And, all the time, the telephone-bell is ringing madly,"
8123,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and Kings are being killed on the Continent, and Empires are saying,"
8124,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""You're another,"" and Mister Gladstone is calling down brimstone upon"
8125,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the British Dominions, and the little black copyboys are whining,"
8126,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""kaa-pi chay-ha-yeh"" (""Copy wanted""), like tired bees, and most of the"
8127,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,paper is as blank as Modred's shield.
8128,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8129,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,But that is the amusing part of the year. There are six other months
8130,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"when none ever come to call, and the thermometer walks inch by inch"
8131,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"up to the top of the glass, and the office is darkened to just above"
8132,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"reading-light, and the press-machines are red-hot to touch, and nobody"
8133,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,writes anything but accounts of amusements in the Hill-stations or
8134,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"obituary notices. Then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror, because"
8135,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew
8136,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"intimately, and the prickly heat covers you with a garment, and you"
8137,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"sit down and write: ""A slight increase of sickness is reported from"
8138,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the Khuda Janta Khan District. The outbreak is purely sporadic in
8139,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"its nature, and, thanks to the energetic efforts of the District"
8140,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"authorities, is now almost at an end. It is, however, with deep regret"
8141,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"we record the death,"" etc."
8142,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8143,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Then the sickness really breaks out, and the less recording and"
8144,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers. But the Empires
8145,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and the Kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before, and"
8146,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the Foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in
8147,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"twenty-four hours, and all the people at the Hill-stations in the"
8148,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"middle of their amusements say, ""Good gracious! why can't the paper be"
8149,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"sparkling? I'm sure there's plenty going on up here."""
8150,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8151,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"That is the dark half of the moon, and, as the advertisements say, ""must"
8152,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"be experienced to be appreciated."""
8153,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8154,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"It was in that season, and a remarkably evil season, that the paper"
8155,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"began running the last issue of the week on Saturday night, which is to"
8156,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"say Sunday morning, after the custom of a London paper. This was a great"
8157,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"convenience, for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn"
8158,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,would lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for
8159,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"half an hour, and in that chill--you have no idea how cold is 84 degrees"
8160,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,on the grass until you begin to pray for it--a very tired man could get
8161,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,off to sleep ere the heat roused him.
8162,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8163,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,One Saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed
8164,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,alone. A King or courtier or a courtesan or a Community was going to
8165,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"die or get a new Constitution, or do something that was important on"
8166,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the other side of the world, and the paper was to be held open till the"
8167,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram.
8168,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8169,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"It was a pitchy-black night, as stifling as a June night can be, and"
8170,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the loo, the red-hot wind from the westward, was booming among the"
8171,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,tinder-dry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels.
8172,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8173,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with
8174,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the flop of a frog, but all our weary world knew that was only pretence."
8175,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"It was a shade cooler in the press-room than the office, so I sat there,"
8176,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"while the type ticked and clicked, and the night-jars hooted at the"
8177,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"windows, and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their"
8178,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"foreheads and called for water. The thing that was keeping us back,"
8179,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"whatever it was, would not come off, though the loo dropped and the last"
8180,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"type was set, and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat,"
8181,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"with its finger on its lip, to wait the event. I drowsed, and wondered"
8182,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"whether the telegraph was a blessing, and whether this dying man, or"
8183,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"struggling people, might be aware of the inconvenience the delay was"
8184,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,causing. There was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make
8185,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"tension, but, as the clock-hands crept up to three o'clock and the"
8186,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,machines spun their fly-wheels two and three times to see that all was
8187,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"in order, before I said the word that would set them off, I could have"
8188,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,shrieked aloud.
8189,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8190,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little
8191,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"bits. I rose to go away, but two men in white clothes stood in front"
8192,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of me. The first one said, ""It's him!"" The second said, ""So it is!"" And"
8193,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared, and mopped"
8194,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"their foreheads. We seed there was a light burning across the road,"
8195,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness, and I said to my"
8196,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"friend here, ""The office is open. Let's come along and speak to him as"
8197,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"turned us back from Degumber State,"" said the smaller of the two. He was"
8198,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the man I had met in the Mhow train, and his fellow was the red-bearded"
8199,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,man of Marwar Junction. There was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one
8200,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,or the beard of the other.
8201,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8202,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I was not pleased, because I wished to go to sleep, not to squabble with"
8203,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"loafers. ""What do you want?"" I asked."
8204,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8205,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Half an hour's talk with you, cool and comfortable, in the office,"""
8206,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"said the red-bearded man. ""We'd like some drink,--the Contrack doesn't"
8207,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"begin yet, Peachey, so you needn't look,--but what we really want is"
8208,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"advice. We don't want money. We ask you as a favour, because we found"
8209,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"out you did us a bad turn about Degumber State."""
8210,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8211,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I led from the press-room to the stifling office with the maps on the
8212,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"walls, and the red-haired man rubbed his hands. ""That's something like,"""
8213,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"said he. ""This was the proper shop to come to."
8214,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8215,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Now, Sir, let me introduce you to Brother Peachey Carnehan, that's"
8216,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"him, and Brother Daniel Dravot, that is me, and the less said about"
8217,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"our professions the better, for we have been most things in our"
8218,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"time--soldier, sailor, compositor, photographer, proof-reader,"
8219,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"street-preacher, and correspondents of the 'Backwoodsman' when we"
8220,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"thought the paper wanted one. Carnehan is sober, and so am I. Look at us"
8221,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"first, and see that's sure. It will save you cutting into my talk. We'll"
8222,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"take one of your cigars apiece, and you shall see us light up."""
8223,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8224,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I watched the test. The men were absolutely sober, so I gave them each a"
8225,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,tepid whisky-and-soda.
8226,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8227,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Well and good,"" said Carnehan of the eyebrows, wiping the froth from"
8228,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"his moustache. ""Let me talk now, Dan. We have been all over India,"
8229,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"mostly on foot. We have been boiler-fitters, engine-drivers, petty"
8230,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"contractors, and all that, and we have decided that India isn't big"
8231,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"enough for such as us."""
8232,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8233,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,They certainly were too big for the office. Dravot's beard seemed to
8234,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"fill half the room and Carnehan's shoulders the other half, as they sat"
8235,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"on the big table. Carnehan continued: ""The country isn't half worked"
8236,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,out because they that governs it won't let you touch it. They spend all
8237,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"their blessed time in governing it, and you can't lift a spade, nor"
8238,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"chip a rock, nor look for oil, nor anything like that, without all the"
8239,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Government saying, 'Leave it alone, and let us govern.' Therefore, such"
8240,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"as it is, we will let it alone, and go away to some other place where"
8241,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a man isn't crowded and can come to his own. We are not little men, and"
8242,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"there is nothing that we are afraid of except Drink, and we have signed"
8243,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,a Contrack on that.
8244,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8245,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Therefore we are going away to be Kings."""
8246,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8247,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Kings in our own right,"" muttered Dravot."
8248,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8249,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Yes, of course,"" I said. ""You've been tramping in the sun, and it's"
8250,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion? Come"
8251,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"tomorrow."""
8252,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8253,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Neither drunk nor sunstruck,"" said Dravot. ""We have slept over the"
8254,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"notion half a year, and require to see Books and Atlases, and we have"
8255,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong
8256,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,men can Sar-a-whack. They call it Kafiristan. By my reckoning it's the
8257,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"top right-hand corner of Afghanistan, not more than three hundred miles"
8258,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"from Peshawar. They have two and thirty heathen idols there, and we'll"
8259,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"be the thirty-third and fourth. It's a mountaineous country, the women"
8260,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of those parts are very beautiful."""
8261,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8262,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""But that is provided against in the Contrack,"" said Carnehan. ""Neither"
8263,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Women nor Liquor, Daniel."""
8264,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8265,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""And that's all we know, except that no one has gone there, and they"

8268,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"we find, 'D' you want to vanquish your foes?' and we will show him how"
8269,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,to drill men; for that we know better than anything else. Then we will

8272,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""You'll be cut to pieces before you're fifty miles across the Border,"""
8273,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I said. ""You have to travel through Afghanistan to get to that country."
8274,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"It's one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers, and no Englishman has"
8275,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"been through it. The people are utter brutes, and even if you reached"
8276,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"them you couldn't do anything."""
8277,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8278,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""That's more like,"" said Carnehan. ""If you could think us a little more"
8279,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,mad we would be more pleased. We have come to you to know about this
8280,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"country, to read a book about it, and to be shown maps. We want you to"
8281,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"tell us that we are fools and to show us your books."" He turned to the"
8282,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,bookcases.
8283,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8284,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Are you at all in earnest?"" I said."
8285,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8286,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""A little,"" said Dravot, sweetly. ""As big a map as you have got, even"
8287,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"if it's all blank where Kafiristan is, and any books you've got. We can"
8288,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"read, though we aren't very educated."""
8289,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8290,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I uncased the big thirty-two-miles-to-the-inch map of India and two
8291,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"smaller Frontier maps, hauled down volume INF-KAN of the ""Encyclopaedia"

8293,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8294,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""See here!"" said Dravot, his thumb on the map. ""Up to Jagdallak, Peachey"
8295,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and me know the road. We was there with Robert's Army. We'll have to
8296,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,turn off to the right at Jagdallak through Laghmann territory. Then we
8297,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,get among the hills--fourteen thousand feet--fifteen thousand--it will
8298,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"be cold work there, but it don't look very far on the map."""
8299,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8300,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I handed him Wood on the ""Sources of the Oxus."" Carnehan was deep in the"

8366,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""You won't enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this"

8369,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8370,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of
8371,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the ""Contrack."" ""Be sure to come down to the Serai tomorrow,"" were their"
8372,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,parting words.
8373,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8374,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,The Kumharsen Serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the
8375,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,strings of camels and horses from the North load and unload. All the
8376,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"nationalities of Central Asia may be found there, and most of the folk"
8377,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of India proper. Balkh and Bokhara there meet Bengal and Bombay, and try"
8378,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to draw eye-teeth. You can buy ponies, turquoises, Persian pussy-cats,"
8379,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"saddle-bags, fat-tailed sheep, and musk in the Kumharsen Serai, and get"
8380,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,many strange things for nothing. In the afternoon I went down to see
8381,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there
8382,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,drunk.
8383,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8384,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"A priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me,"
8385,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,gravely twisting a child's paper whirligig. Behind him was his servant
8386,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,bending under the load of a crate of mud toys. The two were loading up
8387,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"two camels, and the inhabitants of the Serai watched them with shrieks"
8388,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,of laughter.
8389,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8390,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""The priest is mad,"" said a horse-dealer to me. ""He is going up to Kabul"
8391,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,to sell toys to the Amir. He will either be raised to honour or have his

8394,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8395,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""The witless are under the protection of God,"" stammered a flat-cheeked"

8401,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the hands of other robbers just across the Border, and whose misfortunes"
8402,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"were the laughing-stock of the bazaar. ""Ohe', priest, whence come you"
8403,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and whither do you go?"""
8404,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8405,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""From Roum have I come,"" shouted the priest, waving his whirligig; ""from"

8413,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"The protection of Pir Khan be upon his labours!"" He spread out the"
8414,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,skirts of his gabardine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered
8415,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,horses.
8416,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8417,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""There starts a caravan from Peshawar to Kabul in twenty days, Huzrut,"""

8420,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8421,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I will go even now!"" shouted the priest. ""I will depart upon my winged"
8422,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"camels, and be at Peshawar in a day! Ho! Hazar Mir Khan,"" he yelled to"
8423,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"his servant, ""drive out the camels, but let me first mount my own."""
8424,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8425,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt, and, turning round to"
8426,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"me, cried, ""Come thou also, Sahib, a little along the road, and I will"
8427,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"sell thee a charm--an amulet that shall make thee King of Kafiristan."""
8428,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8429,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Then the light broke upon me, and I followed the two camels out of the"
8430,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Serai till we reached open road and the priest halted.
8431,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8432,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""What d' you think o' that?"" said he in English. ""Carnehan can't talk"
8433,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"their patter, so I've made him my servant. He makes a handsome servant."
8434,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,'T isn't for nothing that I've been knocking about the country for

8440,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8441,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I felt the butt of a Martini, and another and another."

8445,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8446,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Heaven help you if you are caught with those things!"" I said. ""A"

8449,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Fifteen hundred rupees of capital--every rupee we could beg, borrow, or"

8452,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""We won't get caught. We're going through the Khaiber with a regular"
8453,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"caravan. Who'd touch a poor mad priest?"""
8454,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8455,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Have you got everything you want?"" I asked, overcome with astonishment."
8456,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8457,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Not yet, but we shall soon. Give us a memento of your kindness,"
8458,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Brother. You did me a service yesterday, and that time in Marwar. Half"
8459,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"my Kingdom shall you have, as the saying is."" I slipped a small charm"
8460,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,compass from my watch-chain and handed it up to the priest.
8461,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8462,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Goodbye,"" said Dravot, giving me hand cautiously. ""It's the last time"
8463,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,we'll shake hands with an Englishman these many days. Shake hands with

8465,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8466,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Carnehan leaned down and shook hands. Then the camels passed away along
8467,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the dusty road, and I was left alone to wonder. My eye could detect no"
8468,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,failure in the disguises. The scene in the Serai proved that they were
8469,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"complete to the native mind. There was just the chance, therefore, that"
8470,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Carnehan and Dravot would be able to wander through Afghanistan without
8471,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"detection. But, beyond, they would find death--certain and awful death."
8472,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8473,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Ten days later a native correspondent, giving me the news of the day"
8474,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"from Peshawar, wound up his letter with: ""There has been much laughter"
8475,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation
8476,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as
8477,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,great charms to H. H. the Amir of Bokhara. He passed through Peshawar
8478,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and associated himself to the Second Summer caravan that goes to Kabul.
8479,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,The merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that
8480,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"such mad fellows bring good fortune."""
8481,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8482,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"The two, then, were beyond the Border. I would have prayed for them, but"
8483,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"that night a real King died in Europe, and demanded an obituary notice."
8484,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8485,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,The wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again.
8486,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Summer passed and winter thereafter, and came and passed again. The"
8487,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"daily paper continued and I with it, and upon the third summer there"
8488,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"fell a hot night, a night issue, and a strained waiting for something to"
8489,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"be telegraphed from the other side of the world, exactly as had happened"
8490,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"before. A few great men had died in the past two years, the machines"
8491,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"worked with more clatter, and some of the trees in the office garden"
8492,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,were a few feet taller. But that was all the difference.
8493,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8494,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I passed over to the press-room, and went through just such a scene as"
8495,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I have already described. The nervous tension was stronger than it
8496,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"had been two years before, and I felt the heat more acutely. At three"
8497,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"o'clock I cried, ""Print off,"" and turned to go, when there crept to my"
8498,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"chair what was left of a man. He was bent into a circle, his head was"
8499,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"sunk between his shoulders, and he moved his feet one over the other"
8500,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,like a bear. I could hardly see whether he walked or crawled--this
8501,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"rag-wrapped, whining cripple who addressed me by name, crying that he"
8502,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was come back. ""Can you give me a drink?"" he whimpered. ""For the Lord's"
8503,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"sake, give me a drink!"""
8504,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8505,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I went back to the office, the man following with groans of pain, and I"
8506,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,turned up the lamp.
8507,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8508,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Don't you know me?"" he gasped, dropping into a chair, and he turned his"
8509,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"drawn face, surmounted by a shock of gray hair, to the light."
8510,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8511,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I looked at him intently. Once before had I seen eyebrows that met over
8512,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the nose in an inch-broad black band, but for the life of me I could not"
8513,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,tell where.
8514,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8515,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I don't know you,"" I said, handing him the whisky. ""What can I do for"
8516,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"you?"""
8517,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8518,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He took a gulp of the spirit raw, and shivered in spite of the"
8519,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,suffocating heat.
8520,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8521,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I've come back,"" he repeated; ""and I was the King of Kafiristan--me and"
8522,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Dravot--crowned Kings we was! In this office we settled it--you setting
8523,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"there and giving us the books. I am Peachey,--Peachey Taliaferro"
8524,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Carnehan,--and you've been setting here ever since--O Lord!"""
8525,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8526,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I was more than a little astonished, and expressed my feelings"
8527,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,accordingly.
8528,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8529,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""It's true,"" said Carnehan, with a dry cackle, nursing his feet, which"
8530,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"were wrapped in rags--""true as gospel. Kings we were, with crowns upon"
8531,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"our heads--me and Dravot--poor Dan--oh, poor, poor Dan, that would never"
8532,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"take advice, not though I begged of him!"""
8533,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8534,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Take the whisky,"" I said, ""and take your own time. Tell me all you can"
8535,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,recollect of everything from beginning to end. You got across the Border
8536,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"on your camels, Dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant. Do"
8537,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"you remember that?"""
8538,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8539,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I ain't mad--yet, but I shall be that way soon. Of course I remember."
8540,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Keep looking at me, or maybe my words will go all to pieces. Keep"
8541,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"looking at me in my eyes and don't say anything."""
8542,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8543,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as I could. He
8544,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,dropped one hand upon the table and I grasped it by the wrist. It
8545,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was twisted like a bird's claw, and upon the back was a ragged, red,"
8546,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,diamond-shaped scar.
8547,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8548,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""No, don't look there. Look at me,"" said Carnehan. ""That comes"
8549,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"afterward, but for the Lord's sake don't distrack me. We left with that"
8550,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"caravan, me and Dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people"
8551,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,we were with. Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the
8552,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"people was cooking their dinners--cooking their dinners, and..."
8553,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,what did they do then? They lit little fires with sparks that went into
8554,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Dravot's beard, and we all laughed--fit to die. Little red fires they"
8555,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was, going into Dravot's big red beard--so funny."" His eyes left mine"
8556,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and he smiled foolishly.
8557,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8558,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""You went as far as Jagdallak with that caravan,"" I said, at a venture,"
8559,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""after you had lit those fires. To Jagdallak, where you turned off to"
8560,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"try to get into Kafiristan."""
8561,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8562,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""No, we didn't, neither. What are you talking about? We turned off"
8563,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"before Jagdallak, because we heard the roads was good. But they wasn't"
8564,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,good enough for our two camels--mine and Dravot's. When we left the
8565,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"caravan, Dravot took off all his clothes and mine too, and said we would"
8566,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"be heathen, because the Kafirs didn't allow Mohammedans to talk to them."
8567,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"So we dressed betwixt and between, and such a sight as Daniel Dravot"
8568,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I never saw yet nor expect to see again. He burned half his beard, and"
8569,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"slung a sheepskin over his shoulder, and shaved his head into patterns."
8570,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He shaved mine too, and made me wear outrageous things to look like"
8571,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a heathen. That was in a most mountaineous country, and our camels"
8572,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,couldn't go along any more because of the mountains. They were tall and
8573,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"black, and coming home I saw them fight like wild goats--there are lots"
8574,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of goats in Kafiristan. And these mountains, they never keep still, no"
8575,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"more than the goats. Always fighting they are, and don't let you sleep"
8576,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"at night."""
8577,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8578,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Take some more whisky,"" I said, very slowly. ""What did you and Daniel"
8579,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads
8580,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"that led into Kafiristan?"""
8581,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8582,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""What did which do? There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan"
8583,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,that was with Dravot. Shall I tell you about him? He died out there in
8584,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the cold. Slap from the bridge fell old Peachey, turning and twisting in"
8585,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the Amir. No; they
8586,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was two for three ha'pence, those whirligigs, or I am much mistaken and"
8587,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"woful sore... And then these camels were no use, and Peachey said to"
8588,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Dravot, 'For the Lord's sake let's get out of this before our heads"
8589,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"are chopped off,' and with that they killed the camels all among the"
8590,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"mountains, not having anything in particular to eat, but first they took"
8591,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition, till two men came along"
8592,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"driving four mules. Dravot up and dances in front of them, singing,"
8593,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"'Sell me four mules.' Says the first man, 'If you are rich enough to"
8594,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"buy, you are rich enough to rob;' but before ever he could put his hand"
8595,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to his knife, Dravot breaks his neck over his knee, and the other party"
8596,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,runs away. So Carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken
8597,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"off the camels, and together we starts forward into those bitter-cold"
8598,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"mountaineous parts, and never a road broader than the back of your"
8599,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"hand."""
8600,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8601,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He paused for a moment, while I asked him if he could remember the"
8602,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,nature of the country through which he had journeyed.
8603,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8604,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I am telling you as straight as I can, but my head isn't as good as it"
8605,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,might be. They drove nails through it to make me hear better how Dravot
8606,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"died. The country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary,"
8607,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary. They went up and up, and"
8608,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"down and down, and that other party, Carnehan, was imploring of Dravot"
8609,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"not to sing and whistle so loud, for fear of bringing down the tremenjus"
8610,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,avalanches. But Dravot says that if a King couldn't sing it wasn't worth
8611,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"being King, and whacked the mules over the rump, and never took no"
8612,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,heed for ten cold days. We came to a big level valley all among the
8613,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"mountains, and the mules were near dead, so we killed them, not having"
8614,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"anything in special for them or us to eat. We sat upon the boxes, and"
8615,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out.
8616,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8617,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley, chasing twenty"
8618,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"men with bows and arrows, and the row was tremenjus."
8619,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8620,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""They was fair men--fairer than you or me--with yellow hair and"
8621,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"remarkable well built. Says Dravot, unpacking the guns, 'This is the"
8622,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"beginning of the business. We'll fight for the ten men,' and with that"
8623,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"he fires two rifles at the twenty men, and drops one of them at two"
8624,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,hundred yards from the rock where he was sitting. The other men began to
8625,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"run, but Carnehan and Dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all"
8626,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"ranges, up and down the valley. Then we goes up to the ten men that"
8627,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"had run across the snow too, and they fires a footy little arrow at us."
8628,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Dravot he shoots above their heads, and they all falls down flat. Then"
8629,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"he walks over them and kicks them, and then he lifts them up and shakes"
8630,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,hands all round to make them friendly like. He calls them and gives them
8631,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the boxes to carry, and waves his hand for all the world as though he"
8632,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,was King already. They takes the boxes and him across the valley and up
8633,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the hill into a pine wood on the top, where there was half a dozen"
8634,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,big stone idols. Dravot he goes to the biggest--a fellow they call
8635,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Imbra--and lays a rifle and a cartridge at his feet, rubbing his nose"
8636,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"respectfully with his own nose, patting him on the head, and nods his"
8637,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"head, and says, 'That's all right. I'm in the know too, and these old"
8638,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"jimjams are my friends.' Then he opens his mouth and points down it, and"
8639,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"when the first man brings him food, he says, 'No;' and when the second"
8640,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"man brings him food, he says 'no;' but when one of the old priests and"
8641,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the boss of the village brings him food, he says, 'Yes;' very haughty,"
8642,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and eats it slow. That was how he came to our first village without any
8643,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"trouble, just as though we had tumbled from the skies. But we tumbled"
8644,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"from one of those damned rope-bridges, you see, and--you couldn't expect"
8645,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a man to laugh much after that?"""
8646,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8647,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Take some more whisky and go on,"" I said. ""That was the first village"
8648,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"you came into. How did you get to be King?"""
8649,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8650,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I wasn't King,"" said Carnehan. ""Dravot he was the King, and a handsome"
8651,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all. Him and the other
8652,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"party stayed in that village, and every morning Dravot sat by the side"
8653,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of old Imbra, and the people came and worshipped. That was Dravot's"
8654,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"order. Then a lot of men came into the valley, and Carnehan Dravot picks"
8655,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"them off with the rifles before they knew where they was, and runs down"
8656,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"into the valley and up again the other side, and finds another village,"
8657,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"same as the first one, and the people all falls down flat on their"
8658,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"faces, and Dravot says, 'Now what is the trouble between you two"
8659,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"villages?' and the people points to a woman, as fair as you or me, that"
8660,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was carried off, and Dravot takes her back to the first village and"
8661,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,counts up the dead--eight there was. For each dead man Dravot pours
8662,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig, and"
8663,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"'That's all right,' says he. Then he and Carnehan takes the big boss of"
8664,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"each village by the arm, and walks them down the valley, and shows them"
8665,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley, and gives each"
8666,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,a sod of turf from both sides of the line. Then all the people comes
8667,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"down and shouts like the devil and all, and Dravot says, 'Go and dig the"
8668,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"land, and be fruitful and multiply,' which they did, though they didn't"
8669,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,understand. Then we asks the names of things in their lingo--bread and
8670,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,water and fire and idols and such; and Dravot leads the priest of each
8671,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"village up to the idol, and says he must sit there and judge the people,"
8672,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot.
8673,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8674,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""Next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as"
8675,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"bees and much prettier, and the priests heard all the complaints and"
8676,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"told Dravot in dumb-show what it was about. 'That's just the beginning,'"
8677,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,says Dravot. 'They think we're Gods.' He and Carnehan picks out twenty
8678,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and
8679,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"advance in line; and they was very pleased to do so, and clever to see"
8680,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the hang of it. Then he takes out his pipe and his baccy-pouch, and"
8681,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"leaves one at one village and one at the other, and off we two goes to"
8682,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"see what was to be done in the next valley. That was all rock, and there"
8683,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was a little village there, and Carnehan says, 'Send 'em to the old"
8684,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"valley to plant,' and takes 'em there and gives 'em some land that"
8685,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"wasn't took before. They were a poor lot, and we blooded 'em with a kid"
8686,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"before letting 'em into the new Kingdom. That was to impress the people,"
8687,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and then they settled down quiet, and Carnehan went back to Dravot, who"
8688,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"had got into another valley, all snow and ice and most mountaineous."
8689,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8690,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""There was no people there, and the Army got afraid; so Dravot shoots"
8691,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"one of them, and goes on till he finds some people in a village, and the"
8692,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better
8693,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"not shoot their little matchlocks, for they had matchlocks. We makes"
8694,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"friends with the priest, and I stays there alone with two of the Army,"
8695,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,teaching the men how to drill; and a thundering big Chief comes across
8696,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging, because he heard there was"
8697,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,a new God kicking about. Carnehan sights for the brown of the men half
8698,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,a mile across the snow and wings one of them. Then he sends a message
8699,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to the Chief that, unless he wished to be killed, he must come and shake"
8700,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"hands with me and leave his arms behind. The Chief comes alone first,"
8701,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and Carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about, same as"
8702,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Dravot used, and very much surprised that Chief was, and strokes"
8703,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"my eyebrows. Then Carnehan goes alone to the Chief, and asks him in"
8704,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"dumb-show if he had an enemy he hated. 'I have,' says the chief. So"
8705,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Carnehan weeds out the pick of his men, and sets the two of the Army to"
8706,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"show them drill, and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about"
8707,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,as well as Volunteers. So he marches with the Chief to a great big plain
8708,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"on the top of a mountain, and the Chief's men rushes into a village and"
8709,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"takes it, we three Martinis firing into the brown of the enemy. So we"
8710,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"took that village too, and I gives the Chief a rag from my coat, and"
8711,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"says, 'Occupy till I come;' which was scriptural. By way of a reminder,"
8712,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"when me and the Army was eighteen hundred yards away, I drops a bullet"
8713,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"near him standing on the snow, and all the people falls flat on their"
8714,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,faces. Then I sends a letter to Dravot wherever he be by land or by
8715,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"sea."""
8716,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8717,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"At the risk of throwing the creature out of train I interrupted: ""How"
8718,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"could you write a letter up yonder?"""
8719,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8720,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""The letter?--oh!--the letter! Keep looking at me between the eyes,"
8721,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"please. It was a string-talk letter, that we'd learned the way of it"
8722,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"from a blind beggar in the Punjab."""
8723,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8724,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with
8725,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a knotted twig, and a piece of string which he wound round the twig"
8726,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"according to some cipher of his own. He could, after the lapse of days"
8727,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"or hours, repeat the sentence which he had reeled up."
8728,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8729,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"He had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds, and tried to"
8730,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"teach me his method, but I could not understand."
8731,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8732,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I sent that letter to Dravot,"" said Carnehan, ""and told him to come"
8733,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,back because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle; and then
8734,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"I struck for the first valley, to see how the priests were working. They"
8735,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"called the village we took along with the Chief, Bashkai, and the first"
8736,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"village we took, Er-Heb. The priests at Er-Heb was doing all right, but"
8737,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me, and some men from"
8738,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,another village had been firing arrows at night. I went out and looked
8739,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"for that village, and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards."
8740,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"That used all the cartridges I cared to spend, and I waited for Dravot,"
8741,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"who had been away two or three months, and I kept my people quiet."
8742,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8743,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""One morning I heard the devil's own noise of drums and horns, and Dan"
8744,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Dravot marches down the hill with his Army and a tail of hundreds of
8745,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"men, and, which was the most amazing, a great gold crown on his head."
8746,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"'My Gord, Carnehan,' says Daniel, 'this is a tremenjus business, and"
8747,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,we've got the whole country as far as it's worth having. I am the son
8748,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of Alexander by Queen Semiramis, and you're my younger brother and a"
8749,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,God too! It's the biggest thing we've ever seen. I've been marching and
8750,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"fighting for six weeks with the Army, and every footy little village for"
8751,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"fifty miles has come in rejoiceful; and more than that, I've got the key"
8752,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of the whole show, as you'll see, and I've got a crown for you! I told"
8753,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"'em to make two of 'em at a place called Shu, where the gold lies in the"
8754,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"rock like suet in mutton. Gold I've seen, and turquoise I've kicked out"
8755,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of the cliffs, and there's garnets in the sands of the river, and here's"
8756,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a chunk of amber that a man brought me. Call up all the priests and,"
8757,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"here, take your crown.'"
8758,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8759,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""One of the men opens a black hair bag, and I slips the crown on. It was"
8760,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"too small and too heavy, but I wore it for the glory. Hammered gold it"
8761,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was--five pounds weight, like a hoop of a barrel."
8762,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8763,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'Peachey,' says Dravot, 'we don't want to fight no more. The Craft's"
8764,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the trick, so help me!' and he brings forward that same Chief that I"
8765,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"left at Bashkai--Billy Fish we called him afterward, because he was so"
8766,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,like Billy Fish that drove the big tank-engine at Mach on the Bolan in
8767,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the old days. 'Shake hands with him,' says Dravot; and I shook hands"
8768,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and nearly dropped, for Billy Fish gave me the Grip. I said nothing, but"
8769,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"tried him with the Fellow-craft Grip. He answers all right, and I tried"
8770,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the Master's Grip, but that was a slip. 'A Fellow-craft he is!' I says"
8771,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to Dan. 'Does he know the word?' 'He does,' says Dan, 'and all the"
8772,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,priests know. It's a miracle! The Chiefs and the priests can work a
8773,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Fellow-craft Lodge in a way that's very like ours, and they've cut the"
8774,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"marks on the rocks, but they don't know the Third Degree, and they've"
8775,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,come to find out. It's Gord's Truth. I've known these long years that
8776,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the Afghans knew up to the Fellow-craft Degree, but this is a miracle."
8777,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"A God and a Grand Master of the Craft am I, and a Lodge in the Third"
8778,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Degree I will open, and we'll raise the head priests and the Chiefs of"
8779,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the villages.'
8780,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8781,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'It's against all the law,' I says, 'holding a Lodge without warrant"
8782,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,from any one; and you know we never held office in any Lodge.'
8783,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8784,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'It's a master stroke o' policy,' says Dravot. 'It means running the"
8785,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,country as easy as a four-wheeled bogie on a down grade. We can't stop
8786,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to inquire now, or they'll turn against us. I've forty Chiefs at my"
8787,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"heel, and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be."
8788,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Billet these men on the villages, and see that we run up a Lodge of some"
8789,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,kind. The temple of Imbra will do for a Lodge-room. The women must make
8790,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,aprons as you show them. I'll hold a levee of Chiefs tonight and Lodge
8791,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,tomorrow.'
8792,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8793,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I was fair run off my legs, but I wasn't such a fool as not to see what"
8794,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,a pull this Craft business gave us. I showed the priests' families how
8795,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to make aprons of the degrees, but for Dravot's apron the blue border"
8796,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide, not cloth. We took"
8797,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"a great square stone in the temple for the Master's chair, and little"
8798,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"stones for the officer's chairs, and painted the black pavement with"
8799,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"white squares, and did what we could to make things regular."
8800,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8801,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""At the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big"
8802,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"bonfires, Dravot gives out that him and me were Gods and sons of"
8803,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Alexander, and Passed Grand Masters in the Craft, and was come to make"
8804,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in
8805,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"quiet, and specially obey us. Then the Chiefs come round to shake hands,"
8806,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with
8807,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,old friends. We gave them names according as they was like men we had
8808,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"known in India--Billy Fish, Holly Dilworth, Pikky Kergan, that was"
8809,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Bazaar-master when I was at Mhow, and so on, and so on."
8810,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8811,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""The most amazing miracles was at Lodge next night. One of the old priests"
8812,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was watching us continuous, and I felt uneasy, for I knew we'd have to"
8813,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"fudge the Ritual, and I didn't know what the men knew. The old priest"
8814,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,was a stranger come in from beyond the village of Bashkai. The minute
8815,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Dravot puts on the Master's apron that the girls had made for him, the"
8816,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"priest fetches a whoop and a howl, and tries to overturn the stone"
8817,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"that Dravot was sitting on. 'It's all up now,' I says. 'That comes of"
8818,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,meddling with the Craft without warrant!' Dravot never winked an
8819,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"eye, not when ten priests took and tilted over the Grand Master's"
8820,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"chair--which was to say, the stone of Imbra. The priest begins rubbing"
8821,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt, and presently he"
8822,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"shows all the other priests the Master's Mark, same as was on Dravot's"
8823,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"apron, cut into the stone. Not even the priests of the temple of Imbra"
8824,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,knew it was there. The old chap falls flat on his face at Dravot's feet
8825,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and kisses 'em. 'Luck again,' says Dravot, across the Lodge, to me;"
8826,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,'they say it's the missing Mark that no one could understand the why of.
8827,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8828,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'We're more than safe now.' Then he bangs the butt of his gun for a"
8829,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"gavel and says, 'By virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right"
8830,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"hand and the help of Peachey, I declare myself Grand Master of all"
8831,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Freemasonry in Kafiristan in this the Mother Lodge o' the country, and"
8832,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,King of Kafiristan equally with Peachey!' At that he puts on his crown
8833,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and I puts on mine,--I was doing Senior Warden,--and we opens the Lodge"
8834,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,in most ample form. It was an amazing miracle! The priests moved in
8835,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling, as if the"
8836,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,memory was coming back to them. After that Peachey and Dravot raised
8837,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,such as was worthy--high priests and Chiefs of far-off villages. Billy
8838,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Fish was the first, and I can tell you we scared the soul out of him. It"
8839,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"was not in any way according to Ritual, but it served our turn. We"
8840,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"didn't raise more than ten of the biggest men, because we didn't want to"
8841,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,make the Degree common. And they was clamouring to be raised.
8842,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8843,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'In another six months,' says Dravot, 'we'll hold another Communication"
8844,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and see how you are working.' Then he asks them about their villages,"
8845,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and learns that they was fighting one against the other, and were sick"
8846,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and tired of it. And when they wasn't doing that they was fighting with
8847,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the Mohammedans. 'You can fight those when they come into our country,'"
8848,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,says Dravot. 'Tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a Frontier
8849,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"guard, and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled."
8850,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well,"
8851,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and I know that you won't cheat me, because you're white people--sons"
8852,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of Alexander--and not like common black Mohammedans. You are my people,"
8853,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and, by God,' says he, running off into English at the end, 'I'll make a"
8854,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"damned fine Nation of you, or I'll die in the making!'"
8855,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8856,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I can't tell all we did for the next six months, because Dravot did a"
8857,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"lot I couldn't see the hang of, and he learned their lingo in a way I"
8858,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"never could. My work was to help the people plough, and now and again"
8859,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"go out with some of the Army and see what the other villages were doing,"
8860,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and make 'em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the
8861,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"country horrid. Dravot was very kind to me, but when he walked up and"
8862,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both
8863,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"fists I knew he was thinking plans I could not advise about, and I just"
8864,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,waited for orders.
8865,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8866,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""But Dravot never showed me disrespect before the people. They were"
8867,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"afraid of me and the Army, but they loved Dan. He was the best of"
8868,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,friends with the priests and the Chiefs; but any one could come across
8869,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the hills with a complaint, and Dravot would hear him out fair, and call"
8870,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,four priests together and say what was to be done.
8871,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8872,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""He used to call in Billy Fish from Bashkai, and Pikky Kergan from Shu,"
8873,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and an old Chief we called Kafuzelum,--it was like enough to his real"
8874,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"name,--and hold councils with 'em when there was any fighting to be done"
8875,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"in small villages. That was his Council of War, and the four priests of"
8876,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Bashkai, Shu, Khawak, and Madora was his Privy Council. Between the lot"
8877,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of 'em they sent me, with forty men and twenty rifles, and sixty men"
8878,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"carrying turquoises, into the Ghorband country to buy those hand-made"
8879,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Martini rifles, that come out of the Amir's workshops at Kabul, from one"
8880,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,of the Amir's Herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out
8881,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,of their mouths for turquoises.
8882,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8883,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""I stayed in Ghorband a month, and gave the Governor there the pick of"
8884,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"my baskets for hush-money, and bribed the Colonel of the regiment some"
8885,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"more, and, between the two and the tribes-people, we got more than a"
8886,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"hundred hand-made Martinis, a hundred good Kohat Jezails that'll throw"
8887,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to six hundred yards, and forty man--loads of very bad ammunition for"
8888,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the rifles. I came back with what I had, and distributed 'em among"
8889,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the men that the Chiefs sent in to me to drill. Dravot was too busy to
8890,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"attend to those things, but the old Army that we first made helped me,"
8891,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"and we turned out five hundred men that could drill, and two hundred"
8892,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"that knew how to hold arms pretty straight. Even those cork-screwed,"
8893,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,hand-made guns was a miracle to them. Dravot talked big about
8894,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"powder-shops and factories, walking up and down in the pine wood when"
8895,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the winter was coming on.
8896,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8897,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'I won't make a Nation,' says he. 'I'll make an Empire! These men"
8898,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,aren't niggers; they're English! Look at their eyes--look at their

8900,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"houses. They're the Lost Tribes, or something like it, and they've grown"
8901,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,to be English. I'll take a census in the spring if the priests don't get
8902,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,frightened. There must be a fair two million of 'em in these hills. The
8903,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,villages are full o' little children. Two million people--two hundred
8904,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,and fifty thousand fighting men--and all English! They only want the
8905,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"rifles and a little drilling. Two hundred and fifty thousand men, ready"
8906,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"to cut in on Russia's right flank when she tries for India! Peachey,"
8907,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"man,' he says, chewing his beard in great hunks, 'we shall be"
8908,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Emperors--Emperors of the Earth! Rajah Brooke will be a suckling to

8914,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,I was in India. The Viceroy shall do it for me; I'll send a man through
8915,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"in the spring for those men, and I'll write for a dispensation from"
8916,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the Grand Lodge for what I've done as Grand Master. That--and all the
8917,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,Sniders that'll be thrown out when the native troops in India take up
8918,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the Martini. They'll be worn smooth, but they'll do for fighting in"

8927,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8928,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'What is it?' I says. 'There are no more men coming in to be drilled"
8929,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,this autumn. Look at those fat black clouds. They're bringing the snow.'
8930,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8931,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'It isn't that,' says Daniel, putting his hand very hard on my"

8941,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
8942,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'Don't let's quarrel, Peachey,' says Daniel, without cursing. 'You're"

8944,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"Peachey, we want cleverer men than us now--three or four of 'em, that"

8968,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,that'll keep you warm in the winter. They're prettier than English
8969,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"girls, and we can take the pick of 'em. Boil 'em once or twice in hot"

8978,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'Who's talking o' women?' says Dravot. 'I said wife--a Queen to breed"

9043,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple half-way
9044,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"down the hill, and I heard the girl crying fit to die. One of the"

9082,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""A little snow had fallen in the night, and everything was white except"

9086,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,
9087,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'For the last time, drop it, Dan,' says I, in a whisper; 'Billy Fish"

9095,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""There was no need to call any one. They were all there leaning on their"

9099,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"close to Daniel as he could, and behind him stood his twenty men with"
9100,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"matchlocks--not a man of them under six feet. I was next to Dravot, and"
9101,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"behind me was twenty men of the regular Army. Up comes the girl, and a"
9102,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"strapping wench she was, covered with silver and turquoises, but white"

9125,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"of shouting, howling creatures, and every soul was shrieking, 'Not a God"
9126,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"nor a Devil, but only a man!' The Bashkai troops stuck to Billy Fish all"
9127,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"they were worth, but their matchlocks wasn't half as good as the Kabul"
9128,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"breech-loaders, and four of them dropped. Dan was bellowing like a bull,"
9129,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,for he was very wrathy; and Billy Fish had a hard job to prevent him

9132,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""'We can't stand,' says Billy Fish. 'Make a run for it down the valley!"
9133,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"The whole place is against us.' The matchlock-men ran, and we went down"
9134,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,the valley in spite of Dravot. He was swearing horrible and crying
9135,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"out that he was a King. The priests rolled great stones on us, and"
9136,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"the regular Army fired hard, and there wasn't more than six men, not"

9146,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,"""My own notion is that Dan began to go mad in his head from that hour."
9147,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,He stared up and down like a stuck pig. Then he was all for walking back
9148,THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING,alone and killing the priests with his bare hands; which he could have

10405,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""",were as cunning as Grish Chunder had hinted. They would allow nothing

10423,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","""I think I deserve twenty-five per cent., don't I, at least,"" he said,"

10448,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","explorations in its woods, where the crew killed three men whom they"

10451,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""",threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods

10453,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","failed, and their legs swelled, and their leader, the red-haired man,"
10454,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","killed two rowers who mutinied, and after a year spent among the woods"
10455,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","they set sail for their own country, and a wind that never failed"
10456,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""",carried them back so safely that they all slept at night. This and much
10457,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""",more Charlie told. Sometimes the voice fell so low that I could not
10458,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","catch the words, though every nerve was on the strain. He spoke of their"
10459,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""","leader, the red-haired man, as a pagan speaks of his God; for it was he"
10460,"""THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD""",who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought best for their

11086,II,
11087,II,Her bitterest enemies--and she had many--could hardly accuse Mrs.
11088,II,Hauksbee of wasting her time. Otis Yeere was one of those wandering
11089,II,"""dumb"" characters, foredoomed through life to be nobody's property. Ten"
11090,II,"years in Her Majesty's Bengal Civil Service, spent, for the most part,"
11091,II,"in undesirable Districts, had given him little to be proud of, and"
11092,II,nothing to bring confidence. Old enough to have lost the first
11093,II,fine careless rapture that showers on the immature 'Stunt imaginary
11094,II,"Commissionerships and Stars, and sends him into the collar with coltish"
11095,II,earnestness and abandon; too young to be yet able to look back upon the
11096,II,"progress he had made, and thank Providence that under the conditions of"
11097,II,"the day he had come even so far, he stood upon the ""dead-centre"" of his"
11098,II,"career. And when a man stands still, he feels the slightest impulse from"
11099,II,"without. Fortune had ruled that Otis Yeere should be, for the first part"
11100,II,"of his service, one of the rank and file who are ground up in the wheels"
11101,II,"of the Administration; losing heart and soul, and mind and strength,"
11102,II,in the process. Until steam replaces manual power in the working of the
11103,II,"Empire, there must always be this percentage--must always be the men"
11104,II,"who are used up, expended, in the mere mechanical routine. For these"
11105,II,promotion is far off and the mill-grind of every day very near and
11106,II,instant. The Secretariats know them only by name; they are not the
11107,II,picked men of the Districts with the Divisions and Collectorates
11108,II,awaiting them. They are simply the rank and file--the food for
11109,II,fever--sharing with the ryot and the plough-bullock the honor of being
11110,II,the plinth on which the State rests. The older ones have lost their
11111,II,aspirations; the younger are putting theirs aside with a sigh. Both
11112,II,learn to endure patiently until the end of the day. Twelve years in the
11113,II,"rank and file, men say, will sap the hearts of the bravest and dull the"
11114,II,wits of the most keen.
11115,II,
11116,II,"Out of this life Otis Yeere had fled for a few months, drifting, for the"
11117,II,"sake of a little masculine society, into Simla. When his leave was over"
11118,II,"he would return to his swampy, sour-green, undermanned district,"
11119,II,"the native Assistant, the native Doctor, the native Magistrate, the"
11120,II,"steaming, sweltering Station, the ill-kempt City, and the undisguised"
11121,II,insolence of the Municipality that babbled away the lives of men. Life
11122,II,"was cheap, however. The soil spawned humanity, as it bred frogs in"
11123,II,"the Rains, and the gap of the sickness of one season was filled to"
11124,II,overflowing by the fecundity of the next. Otis was unfeignedly thankful
11125,II,"to lay down his work for a little while and escape from the seething,"
11126,II,"whining, weakly hive, impotent to help itself, but strong in its power"
11127,II,"to cripple, thwart, and annoy the weary-eyed man who, by official irony,"
11128,II,"was said to be ""in charge"" of it."
11129,II,
11130,II,* * * * *
11131,II,
11132,II,"""I knew there were women-dowdies in Bengal. They come up here sometimes."
11133,II,"But I didn't know that there were men-dowdies, too."""
11134,II,
11135,II,"Then, for the first time, it occurred to Otis Yeere that his clothes"
11136,II,were rather ancestral in appearance. It will be seen from the above that
11137,II,his friendship with Mrs Hauksbee had made great strides.
11138,II,
11139,II,"As that lady truthfully says, a man is never so happy as when he is"
11140,II,"talking about himself. From Otis Yeere's lips Mrs Hauksbee, before long,"
11141,II,learned everything that she wished to know about the subject of her
11142,II,experiment; learned what manner of life he had led in what she vaguely
11143,II,"called ""those awful cholera districts""; learned too, but this knowledge"
11144,II,"came later, what manner of life he had purposed to lead and what dreams"
11145,II,"he had dreamed in the year of grace '77, before the reality had knocked"
11146,II,the heart out of him. Very pleasant are the shady bridle-paths round
11147,II,Prospect Hill for the telling of such confidences.
11148,II,
11149,II,"""Not yet,"" said Mrs. Hauksbee to Mrs. Mallowe. ""Not yet. I must wait"
11150,II,"until the man is properly dressed, at least. Great Heavens, is it"
11151,II,"possible that he doesn't know what an honor it is to be taken up by Me!"""
11152,II,
11153,II,Mrs. Hauksbee did not reckon false modesty as one of her failings.
11154,II,
11155,II,"""Always with Mrs. Hauksbee!"" murmured Mrs. Mallowe, with her sweetest"
11156,II,"smile, to Otis. ""Oh you men, you men! Here are our Punjabis growling"
11157,II,because you've monopolized the nicest woman in Simla. They'll tear you
11158,II,"to pieces on the Mall, some day, Mr. Yeere."""
11159,II,
11160,II,"Mrs. Mallowe rattled down-hill, having satisfied herself, by a glance"
11161,II,"through the fringe of her sunshade, of the effect of her words."
11162,II,
11163,II,The shot went home. Of a surety Otis Yeere was somebody in this
11164,II,bewildering whirl of Simla--had monopolized the nicest woman in it and
11165,II,the Punjabis were growling. The notion justified a mild glow of vanity.
11166,II,He had never looked upon his acquaintance with Mrs. Hauksbee as a matter
11167,II,for general interest.
11168,II,
11169,II,The knowledge of envy was a pleasant feeling to the man of no account.
11170,II,"It was intensified later in the day when a luncher at the Club said,"
11171,II,"spitefully, ""Well, for a debilitated Ditcher, Yeere, you are going it."
11172,II,Hasn't any kind friend told you that she's the most dangerous woman in
11173,II,"Simla?"""
11174,II,
11175,II,"Yeere chuckled and passed out. When, oh when, would his new clothes be"
11176,II,"ready? He descended into the Mall to inquire; and Mrs. Hauksbee,"
11177,II,"coming over the Church Ridge in her 'rickshaw, looked down upon him"
11178,II,"approvingly. ""He's learning to carry himself as if he were a man,"
11179,II,"instead of a piece of furniture, and""--she screwed up her eyes to see"
11180,II,"the better through the sunlight--""he is a man when he holds himself like"
11181,II,"that. Oh blessed Conceit, what should we be without you?"""
11182,II,
11183,II,With the new clothes came a new stock of self-confidence. Otis Yeere
11184,II,discovered that he could enter a room without breaking into a gentle
11185,II,"perspiration--could cross one, even to talk to Mrs. Hauksbee, as though"
11186,II,rooms were meant to be crossed. He was for the first time in nine years
11187,II,"proud of himself, and contented with his life, satisfied with his new"
11188,II,"clothes, and rejoicing in the friendship of Mrs. Hauksbee."
11189,II,
11190,II,"""Conceit is what the poor fellow wants,"" she said in confidence to Mrs."
11191,II,"Mallowe. ""I believe they must use Civilians to plough the fields with in"
11192,II,Lower Bengal. You see I have to begin from the very beginning--haven't
11193,II,"I? But you'll admit, won't you, dear, that he is immensely improved"
11194,II,since I took him in hand. Only give me a little more time and he won't
11195,II,"know himself."""
11196,II,
11197,II,"Indeed, Yeere was rapidly beginning to forget what he had been. One of"
11198,II,"his own rank and file put the matter brutally when he asked Yeere, in"
11199,II,"reference to nothing, ""And who has been making you a Member of Council,"
11200,II,"lately? You carry the side of half a dozen of 'em."""
11201,II,
11202,II,"""I--I'm awf'ly sorry. I didn't mean it, you know,"" said Yeere,"
11203,II,apologetically.
11204,II,
11205,II,"""There'll be no holding you,"" continued the old stager, grimly. ""Climb"
11206,II,"down, Otis--climb down, and get all that beastly affectation knocked out"
11207,II,"of you with fever! Three thousand a month wouldn't support it."""
11208,II,
11209,II,Yeere repeated the incident to Mrs. Hauksbee. He had come to look upon
11210,II,her as his Mother Confessor.
11211,II,
11212,II,"""And you apologized!"" she said. ""Oh, shame! I hate a man who apologizes."
11213,II,Never apologize for what your friend called 'side.' Never! It's a man's
11214,II,business to be insolent and overbearing until he meets with a stronger.
11215,II,"Now, you bad boy, listen to me."""
11216,II,
11217,II,"Simply and straightforwardly, as the 'rickshaw loitered round Jakko,"
11218,II,"Mrs. Hauksbee preached to Otis Yeere the Great Gospel of Conceit,"
11219,II,illustrating it with living pictures encountered during their Sunday
11220,II,afternoon stroll.
11221,II,
11222,II,"""Good gracious!"" she ended, with the personal argument, ""you'll"
11223,II,"apologize next for being my attache?"""
11224,II,
11225,II,"""Never!"" said Otis Yeere. ""That's another thing altogether. I shall"
11226,II,"always be""--"

11228,II,"""What's coming?"" thought Mrs. Hauksbee."
11229,II,
11230,II,"""Proud of that,"" said Otis."
11231,II,
11232,II,"""Safe for the present,"" she said to herself."
11233,II,
11234,II,"""But I'm afraid I have grown conceited. Like Jeshurun, you know. When"

11237,II,

11248,II,
11249,II,"""Gullals. A piece of nonsense. I've far too much work to do to bother"

11252,II,Rains! A sheet of water with the railway-embankment and the snakes
11253,II,"sticking out, and, in the summer, green flies and green squash. The"
11254,II,people would die of fear if you shook a dogwhip at 'em. But they know
11255,II,"you're forbidden to do that, so they conspire to make your life a burden"
11256,II,"to you. My District's worked by some man at Darjiling, on the strength"
11257,II,"of u native pleader's false reports. Oh, it's a heavenly place!"""
11258,II,
11259,II,Otis Yeere laughed bitterly.
11260,II,
11261,II,"""There's not the least necessity that you should stay in it. Why do"
11262,II,"you?"""
11263,II,
11264,II,"""Because I must. How'm I to get out of it?"""
11265,II,
11266,II,"""How! In a hundred and fifty ways. If there weren't so many people on"
11267,II,"the road, I'd like to box your ears. Ask, my dear boy, ask! Look, There"
11268,II,is young Hexarly with six years' service and half your talents. He asked
11269,II,"for what he wanted, and he got it. See, down by the Convent! There's"
11270,II,"McArthurson who has come to his present position by asking--sheer,"
11271,II,downright asking--after he had pushed himself out of the rank and file.
11272,II,One man is as good as another in your service--believe me. I've seen
11273,II,Simla for more seasons than I care to think about. Do you suppose men
11274,II,are chosen for appointments because of their special fitness beforehand?
11275,II,"You have all passed a high test--what do you call it?--in the beginning,"
11276,II,"and, except for the few who have gone altogether to the bad, you can all"
11277,II,"work hard. Asking does the rest. Call it cheek, call it insolence, call"
11278,II,"it anything you like, but ask! Men argue--yes, I know what men say--that"
11279,II,"a man, by the mere audacity of his request, must have some good in him."
11280,II,A weak man doesn't say: 'Give me this and that.' He whines 'Why haven't
11281,II,"I been given this and that?' If you were in the Army, I should say learn"
11282,II,to spin plates or play a tambourine with your toes. As it is--ask! You
11283,II,"belong to a Service that ought to be able to command the Channel Fleet,"
11284,II,"or set a leg at twenty minutes' notice, and yet you hesitate over asking"
11285,II,to escape from a squashy green district where you admit you are not
11286,II,master. Drop the Bengal Government altogether. Even Darjiling is
11287,II,"a little out-of-the-way hole. I was there once, and the rents were"
11288,II,extortionate. Assert yourself. Get the Government of India to take you
11289,II,"over. Try to get on the Frontier, where every man has a grand chance"
11290,II,if he can trust himself. Go somewhere! Do something! You have twice the

11295,II,
11296,II,"""I don't know,"" said Yeere, rather taken aback by the unexpected"
11297,II,"eloquence. ""1 haven't such a good opinion of myself."""
11298,II,
11299,II,"It was not strictly Platonic, but it was Policy. Mrs. Hauksbee laid"
11300,II,her hand lightly upon the ungloved paw that rested on the turned-back
11301,II,"'rickshaw hood, and, looking the man full in the face, said tenderly,"
11302,II,"almost too tenderly, ""I believe in you if you mistrust yourself. Is that"
11303,II,"enough, my friend?"""
11304,II,
11305,II,"""It is enough,"" answered Otis, very solemnly."
11306,II,
11307,II,"He was silent for a long time, redreaming the dreams that he had dreamed"
11308,II,"eight years ago, but through them all ran, as sheet-lightning through"
11309,II,"golden cloud, the light of Mrs. Hauksbee's violet eyes."
11310,II,
11311,II,Curious and impenetrable are the mazes of Simla life--the only existence
11312,II,in this desolate land worth the living. Gradually it went abroad among
11313,II,"men and women, in the pauses between dance, play and Gymkhana, that Otis"
11314,II,"Yeere, the man with the newly-lit light of self-confidence in his eyes,"
11315,II,"had ""done something decent"" in the wilds whence he came. He had brought"
11316,II,"an erring Municipality to reason, appropriated the funds on his own"
11317,II,"responsibility, and saved the lives of hundreds, He knew more about"
11318,II,the Gullals than any living man. Had a vast knowledge of the aboriginal
11319,II,"tribes; was, in spite of his juniority, the greatest authority on the"
11320,II,aboriginal Gullals. No one quite knew who or what the Gullals were till
11321,II,"The Mussuck, who had been calling on Mrs. Hauksbee, and prided himself"
11322,II,"upon picking people's brains, explained they were a tribe of ferocious"
11323,II,"hillmen, somewhere near Sikkim, whose friendship even the Great Indian"
11324,II,Empire would find it worth her while to secure. Now we know that Otis
11325,II,Yeere had showed Mrs. Hauksbee his MS notes of six years' standing on
11326,II,"the same Gullals. He had told her, too, how, sick and shaken with the"
11327,II,"fever their negligence had bred, crippled by the loss of his pet clerk,"
11328,II,"and savagely angry at the desolation in his charge, he had once damned"
11329,II,"the collective eyes of his ""intelligent local board"" for a set of"
11330,II,"haramzadas. Which act of ""brutal and tyrannous oppression"" won him"
11331,II,a Reprimand Royal from the Bengal Government; but in the anecdote as
11332,II,amended for Northern consumption we find no record of this. Hence we are
11333,II,"forced to conclude that Mrs. Hauksbee ""edited"" his reminiscences before"
11334,II,"sowing them in idle ears, ready, as she well knew, to exaggerate good or"
11335,II,evil. And Otis Yeere bore himself as befitted the hero of many tales.
11336,II,
11337,II,"""You can talk to me when you don't fall into a brown study. Talk now,"
11338,II,"and talk your brightest and best,"" said Mrs. Hauksbee."
11339,II,
11340,II,Otis needed no spur. Look to a man who has the counsel of a woman of or
11341,II,"above the world to back him. So long as he keeps his head, he can meet"
11342,II,"both sexes on equal ground--an advantage never intended by Providence,"
11343,II,"who fashioned Man on one day and Woman on another, in sign that neither"
11344,II,should know more than a very little of the other's life. Such a man goes
11345,II,"far, or, the counsel being withdrawn, collapses suddenly while his world"
11346,II,seeks the reason.
11347,II,
11348,II,"Generalled by Mrs. Hauksbee who, again, had all Mrs. Mallowe's wisdom"
11349,II,"at her disposal, proud of himself and, in the end, believing in himself"
11350,II,"because he was believed in, Otis Yeere stood ready for any fortune that"
11351,II,"might befall, certain that it would be good. He would fight for his own"
11352,II,"hand, and intended that this second struggle should lead to better issue"
11353,II,than the first helpless surrender of the bewildered 'Stunt.
11354,II,
11355,II,"What might have happened, it is impossible to say. This lamentable thing"
11356,II,"befell, bred directly by a statement of Mrs. Hauksbee that she would"
11357,II,spend the next season in Darjiling.
11358,II,
11359,II,"""Are you certain of that?"" said Otis Yeere."
11360,II,
11361,II,"""Quite. We're writing about a house now."""
11362,II,
11363,II,"Otis Yeere ""stopped dead,"" as Mrs. Hauksbee put it in discussing the"
11364,II,relapse with Mrs. Mallowe.
11365,II,
11366,II,"""He has behaved,"" she said, angrily, ""just like Captain Kerrington's"
11367,II,pony--only Otis is a donkey--at the last Gymkhana. Planted his forefeet
11368,II,"and refused to go on another step. Polly, my man's going to disappoint"

11370,II,
11371,II,"As a rule, Mrs. Mallowe does not approve of staring, but on this"

11374,II,"""You have managed cleverly so far,"" she said. ""Speak to him, and ask him"

11397,II,"""What in the world has happened?"" said Mrs. Mallowe, but her eyes showed"

11400,II,"""Happened! Everything has happened! He was there. I went to him and"
11401,II,"said, 'Now, what does this nonsense mean?' Don't laugh, dear, I can't"

11403,II,"I sat it out with him and wanted an explanation, and he said--Oh! I"

11405,II,to Darjiling next year? It doesn't matter to me where I go. I'd have

11517,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11518,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Once upon a time there was a man and his Wife and a Tertium Quid.
11519,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11520,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"All three were unwise, but the Wife was the unwisest. The Man should"
11521,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"have looked after his Wife, who should have avoided the Tertium Quid,"
11522,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"who, again, should have married a wife of his own, after clean and"
11523,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"open flirtations, to which nobody can possibly object, round Jakko or"
11524,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Observatory Hill. When you see a young man with his pony in a white
11525,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"lather, and his hat on the back of his head flying down-hill at fifteen"
11526,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,miles an hour to meet a girl who will be properly surprised to meet
11527,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"him, you naturally approve of that young man, and wish him Staff"
11528,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Appointments, and take an interest in his welfare, and, as the proper"
11529,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"time comes, give them sugar-tongs or side-saddles, according to your"
11530,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,means and generosity.
11531,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11532,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"The Tertium Quid flew down-hill on horseback, but it was to meet the"
11533,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Man's Wife; and when he flew up-hill it was for the same end. The Man
11534,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"was in the Plains, earning money for his Wife to spend on dresses and"
11535,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"four-hundred-rupee bracelets, and inexpensive luxuries of that kind. He"
11536,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"worked very hard, and sent her a letter or a post-card daily. She also"
11537,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"wrote to him daily, and said that she was longing for him to come up to"
11538,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Simla. The Tertium Quid used to lean over her shoulder and laugh as she
11539,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,wrote the notes. Then the two would ride to the Post Office together.
11540,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11541,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Now, Simla is a strange place and its customs are peculiar; nor is"
11542,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,any man who has not spent at least ten seasons there qualified to pass
11543,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"judgment on circumstantial evidence, which is the most untrustworthy in"
11544,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"the Courts. For these reasons, and for others which need not appear,"
11545,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,I decline to state positively whether there was anything irretrievably
11546,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,wrong in the relations between the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid. If
11547,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"there was, and hereon you must form your own opinion, it was the Man's"
11548,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Wife's fault. She was kittenish in her manners, wearing generally an"
11549,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,air of soft and fluffy innocence. But she was deadly learned and
11550,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"evil-instructed; and, now and again, when the mask dropped, men saw"
11551,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"this, shuddered and almost drew back. Men are occasionally particular,"
11552,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,and the least particular men are always the most exacting.
11553,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11554,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Simla is eccentric in its fashion of tearing friendships. Certain
11555,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,attachments which have set and crystallized through half a dozen seasons
11556,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"acquire almost the sanctity of the marriage bond, and are revered as"
11557,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"such. Again, certain attachments equally old, and, to all appearance,"
11558,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"equally venerable, never seem to win any recognized official status;"
11559,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"while a chance-sprung acquaintance now two months born, steps into the"
11560,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,place which by right belongs to the senior. There is no law reducible to
11561,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,print which regulates these affairs.

11563,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Some people have a gift which secures them infinite toleration, and"
11564,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,others have not. The Man's Wife had not. If she looked over the garden
11565,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"wall, for instance, women taxed her with stealing their husbands. She"
11566,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,complained pathetically that she was not allowed to choose her own
11567,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"friends. When she put up her big white muff to her lips, and gazed over"
11568,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"it and under her eyebrows at you as she said this thing, you felt"
11569,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"that she had been infamously misjudged, and that all the other women's"
11570,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,instincts were all wrong; which was absurd. She was not allowed to own
11571,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,the Tertium Quid in peace; and was so strangely constructed that she
11572,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,would not have enjoyed peace had she been so permitted. She preferred

11586,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,from her husband out of her saddle-pocket and gave it to the Tertium

11588,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11589,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"It was an honest letter, written by an honest man, then stewing in the"
11590,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Plains on two hundred rupees a month (for he allowed his wife eight
11591,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"hundred and fifty), and in a silk banian and cotton trousers. It is said"
11592,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"that, perhaps, she had no thought of the unwisdom of allowing her name"
11593,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,to be so generally coupled with the Tertium Quid's; that she was too
11594,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,much of a child to understand the dangers of that sort of thing; that
11595,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"he, her husband, was the last man in the world to interfere jealously"
11596,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"with her little amusements and interests, but that it would be better"

11598,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"The letter was sweetened with many pretty little pet names, and it"
11599,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"amused the Tertium Quid considerably. He and She laughed over it, so"
11600,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"that you, fifty yards away, could see their shoulders shaking while the"
11601,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,horses slouched along side by side.
11602,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11603,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Their conversation was not worth reporting. The upshot of it was that,"
11604,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"next day, no one saw the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid together. They"
11605,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"had both gone down to the Cemetery, which, as a rule, is only visited"
11606,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,officially by the inhabitants of Simla.
11607,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11608,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"A Simla funeral with the clergyman riding, the mourners riding, and the"
11609,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"coffin creaking as it swings between the bearers, is one of the most"
11610,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"depressing things on this earth, particularly when the procession passes"
11611,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"under the wet, dank dip beneath the Rockcliffe Hotel, where the sun is"
11612,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,shut out and all the hill streams are wailing and weeping together as
11613,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,they go down the valleys.
11614,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11615,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Occasionally folk tend the graves, but we in India shift and are"
11616,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"transferred so often that, at the end of the second year, the Dead have"
11617,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,no friends--only acquaintances who are far too busy amusing themselves
11618,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,up the hill to attend to old partners. The idea of using a Cemetery as
11619,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,a rendezvous is distinctly a feminine one. A man would have said simply
11620,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""Let people talk. We'll go down the Mall."" A woman is made differently,"
11621,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,especially if she be such a woman as the Man's Wife. She and the Tertium
11622,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Quid enjoyed each other's society among the graves of men and women whom
11623,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,they had known and danced with aforetime.

11625,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,They used to take a big horse-blanket and sit on the grass a little to
11626,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"the left of the lower end, where there is a dip in the ground and where"
11627,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,the occupied graves stop short and the ready-made ones are not ready.
11628,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Each well-regulated India Cemetery keeps half a dozen graves permanently
11629,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,open for contingencies and incidental wear and tear. In the Hills these
11630,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"are more usually baby's size, because children who come up weakened and"
11631,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,sick from the Plains often succumb to the effects of the Rains in
11632,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,the Hills or get pneumonia from their ayahs taking them through damp
11633,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"pine-woods after the sun has set. In Cantonments, of course, the man's"
11634,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,size is more in request; these arrangements varying with the climate and
11635,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,population.
11636,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11637,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,One day when the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid had just arrived in the
11638,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Cemetery, they saw some coolies breaking ground. They had marked out a"
11639,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"full-size grave, and the Tertium Quid asked them whether any Sahib was"
11640,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,sick. They said that they did not know; but it was an order that they
11641,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,should dig a Sahib's grave.
11642,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11643,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""Work away,"" said the Tertium Quid, ""and let's see how it's done."""
11644,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11645,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"The coolies worked away, and the Man's Wife and the Tertium Quid watched"
11646,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,and talked for a couple of hours while the grave was being deepened Then
11647,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"a coolie, taking the earth in blankets as it was thrown up, jumped over"
11648,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,the grave.
11649,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11650,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""That's queer,"" said the Tertium Quid. ""Where's my ulster?"""
11651,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11652,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""What's queer?"" said the Man's Wife."
11653,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11654,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""I have got a chill down my back just as if a goose had walked over my"
11655,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"grave."""
11656,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11657,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""Why do you look at the thing, then?"" said the Man's Wife. ""Let us go."""
11658,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11659,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"The Tertium Quid stood at the head of the grave, and stared without"
11660,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"answering for a space. Then he said, dropping a pebble down, ""It"
11661,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,is nasty and cold; horribly cold. I don't think I shall come to the
11662,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Cemetery any more. I don't think grave-digging is cheerful."""
11663,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11664,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,The two talked and agreed that the Cemetery was depressing. They also
11665,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,arranged for a ride next day out from the Cemetery through the Mashobra
11666,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Tunnel up to Fagoo and back, because all the world was going to a"
11667,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"garden-party at Viceregal Lodge, and all the people of Mashobra would go"
11668,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,too.
11669,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11670,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Coming up the Cemetery road, the Tertium Quid's horse tried to bolt up"
11671,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"hill, being tired with standing so long, and managed to strain a back"
11672,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,sinew.
11673,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11674,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""I shall have to take the mare tomorrow,"" said the Tertium Quid, ""and"
11675,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"she will stand nothing heavier than a snaffle."""
11676,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11677,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"They made their arrangements to meet in the Cemetery, after allowing"
11678,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,all the Mashobra people time to pass into Simla. That night it rained
11679,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"heavily, and next day, when the Tertium Quid came to the trysting-place,"
11680,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"he saw that the new grave had a foot of water in it, the ground being a"
11681,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,tough and sour clay.
11682,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11683,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""'Jove! That looks beastly,"" said the Tertium Quid. ""Fancy being boarded"
11684,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"up and dropped into that well!"""
11685,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11686,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"They then started off to Fagoo, the mare playing with the snaffle and"
11687,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"picking her way as though she were shod with satin, and the sun shining"
11688,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,divinely. The road below Mashobra to Fagoo is officially styled the
11689,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,Himalayan-Thibet Road; but in spite of its name it is not much more than
11690,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"six feet wide in most places, and the drop into the valley below must be"
11691,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,anything between one and two thousand feet.
11692,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11693,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""Now we're going to Thibet,"" said the Man's Wife merrily, as the horses"
11694,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,drew near to Fagoo. She was riding on the cliff-side.
11695,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11696,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""Into Thibet,"" said the Tertium Quid, ""ever so far from people who say"
11697,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"horrid things, and hubbies who write stupid letters. With you--to the"
11698,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"end of the world!"""
11699,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11700,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"A coolie carrying a log of wood came round a corner, and the mare went"
11701,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"wide to avoid him--forefeet in and haunches out, as a sensible mare"
11702,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,should go.
11703,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11704,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"""To the world's end,"" said the Man's Wife, and looked unspeakable things"
11705,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,over her near shoulder at the Tertium Quid.
11706,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11707,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"He was smiling, but, while she looked, the smile froze stiff as it were"
11708,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"on his face, and changed to a nervous grin--the sort of grin men wear"
11709,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,when they are not quite easy in their saddles. The mare seemed to be
11710,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"sinking by the stem, and her nostrils cracked while she was trying to"
11711,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,realize what was happening. The rain of the night before had rotted the
11712,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"drop-side of the Himalayan-Thibet Road, and it was giving way under"
11713,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"her. ""What are you doing?"" said the Man's Wife. The Tertium Quid gave no"
11714,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"answer. He grinned nervously and set his spurs into the mare, who rapped"
11715,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"with her forefeet on the road, and the struggle began. The Man's Wife"
11716,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"screamed, ""Oh, Frank, get off!"""
11717,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11718,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,But the Tertium Quid was glued to the saddle--his face blue and
11719,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,white--and he looked into the Man's Wife's eyes. Then the Man's Wife
11720,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,clutched at the mare's head and caught her by the nose instead of the
11721,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"bridle. The brute threw up her head and went down with a scream, the"
11722,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"Tertium Quid upon her, and the nervous grin still set on his face."
11723,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11724,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,The Man's Wife heard the tinkle-tinkle of little stones and loose earth
11725,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"falling off the roadway, and the sliding roar of the man and horse going"
11726,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"down. Then everything was quiet, and she called on Frank to leave his"
11727,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"mare and walk up. But Frank did not answer. He was underneath the mare,"
11728,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"nine hundred feet below, spoiling a patch of Indian corn."
11729,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11730,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,As the revellers came back from Viceregal Lodge in the mists of the
11731,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"evening, they met a temporarily insane woman, on a temporarily mad"
11732,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"horse, swinging round the corners, with her eyes and her mouth open, and"
11733,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,her head like the head of the Medusa. She was stopped by a man at the
11734,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"risk of his life, and taken out of the saddle, a limp heap, and put on"
11735,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"the bank to explain herself. This wasted twenty minutes, and then she"
11736,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"was sent home in a lady's 'rickshaw, still with her mouth open and her"
11737,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,hands picking at her riding-gloves.
11738,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11739,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"She was in bed through the following three days, which were rainy; so"
11740,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"she missed attending the funeral of the Tertium Quid, who was lowered"
11741,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,"into eighteen inches of water, instead of the twelve to which he had"
11742,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,first objected.
11743,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11744,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11745,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11746,AT THE PIT'S MOUTH,
11747,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,A WAYSIDE COMEDY
11748,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11749,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore"
11750,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the misery of man is great upon him.
11751,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,--Eccles. viii. 6.
11752,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11753,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Fate and the Government of India have turned the Station of Kashima into
11754,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"a prison; and, because there is no help for the poor souls who are now"
11755,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"lying there in torment, I write this story, praying that the Government"
11756,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,of India may be moved to scatter the European population to the four
11757,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,winds.
11758,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11759,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Kashima is bound on all sides by the rock-tipped circle of the Dosehri
11760,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"hills. In Spring, it is ablaze with roses; in Summer, the roses die and"
11761,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the hot winds blow from the hills; in Autumn, the white mists from"
11762,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the hills cover the place as with water; and in Winter the frosts nip
11763,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,everything young and tender to earth-level. There is but one view in
11764,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kashima--a stretch of perfectly flat pasture and plough-land, running up"
11765,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,to the grey-blue scrub of the Dosehri hills.
11766,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11767,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"There are no amusements, except snipe and tiger shooting; but the tigers"
11768,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"have been long since hunted from their lairs in the rock-caves, and the"
11769,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,snipe only come once a year. Narkarra--one hundred and forty-three miles
11770,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,by road--is the nearest station to Kashima. But Kashima never goes
11771,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to Narkarra, where there are at least twelve English people. It stays"
11772,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,within the circle of the Dosehri hills.
11773,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11774,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,All Kashima acquits Mrs. Vansuythen of any intention to do harm; but all
11775,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kashima knows that she, and she alone, brought about their pain."
11776,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11777,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte, the Engineer, Mrs. Boulte, and Captain Kurrell know this. They"
11778,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"are the English population of Kashima, if we except Major Vansuythen,"
11779,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"who is of no importance whatever, and Mrs. Vansuythen, who is the most"
11780,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,important of all.
11781,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11782,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"You must remember, though you will not understand, that all laws weaken"
11783,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,in a small and hidden community where there is no public opinion. When
11784,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,a man is absolutely alone in a Station he runs a certain risk of
11785,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,falling into evil ways. The risk is multiplied by every addition to
11786,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the population up to twelve--the Jury-number. After that, fear and"
11787,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"consequent restraint begin, and human action becomes less grotesquely"
11788,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,jerky.
11789,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11790,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,There was deep peace in Kashima till Mrs. Vansuythen arrived. She was a
11791,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"charming woman, every one said so everywhere; and she charmed every"
11792,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"one. In spite of this, or, perhaps, because of this, since Fate is so"
11793,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"perverse, she cared only for one man, and he was Major Vansuythen. Had"
11794,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"she been plain or stupid, this matter would have been intelligible to"
11795,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kashima. But she was a fair woman, with very still grey eyes, the color"
11796,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,of a lake just before the light of the sun touches it. No man who had
11797,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"seen those eyes, could, later on, explain what fashion of woman she was"
11798,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to look upon. The eyes dazzled him. Her own sex said that she was ""not"
11799,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"bad looking, but spoiled by pretending to be so grave."" And yet her"
11800,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,gravity was natural It was not her habit to smile. She merely went
11801,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"through life, looking at those who passed; and the women objected while"
11802,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the men fell down and worshipped.
11803,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11804,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,She knows and is deeply sorry for the evil she has done to Kashima; but
11805,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Major Vansuythen cannot understand why Mrs. Boulte does not drop in
11806,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to afternoon tea at least three times a week. ""When there are only two"
11807,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"women in one Station, they ought to see a great deal of each other,"""
11808,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,says Major Vansuythen.
11809,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11810,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Long and long before ever Mrs. Vansuythen came out of those far-away
11811,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"places where there is society and amusement, Kurrell had discovered that"
11812,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Mrs. Boulte was the one woman in the world for him and--you dare not
11813,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,blame them. Kashima was as out of the world as Heaven or the Other
11814,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Place, and the Dosehri hills kept their secret well. Boulte had no"
11815,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,concern in the matter. He was in camp for a fortnight at a time. He was
11816,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"a hard, heavy man, and neither Mrs. Boulte nor Kurrell pitied him. They"
11817,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"had all Kashima and each other for their very, very own; and Kashima"
11818,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,was the Garden of Eden in those days. When Boulte returned from his
11819,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"wanderings he would slap Kurrell between the shoulders and call him ""old"
11820,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"fellow,"" and the three would dine together. Kashima was happy then when"
11821,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the judgment of God seemed almost as distant as Narkarra or the railway
11822,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,that ran down to the sea. But the Government sent Major Vansuythen to
11823,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kashima, and with him came his wife."
11824,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11825,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,The etiquette of Kashima is much the same as that of a desert island.
11826,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"When a stranger is cast away there, all hands go down to the shore to"
11827,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,make him welcome. Kashima assembled at the masonry platform close to
11828,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the Narkarra Road, and spread tea for the Vansuythens. That ceremony was"
11829,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"reckoned a formal call, and made them free of the Station, its rights"
11830,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"and privileges. When the Vansuythens were settled down, they gave a tiny"
11831,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"housewarming to all Kashima; and that made Kashima free of their house,"
11832,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,according to the immemorial usage of the Station.
11833,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11834,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Then the Rains came, when no one could go into camp, and the Narkarra"
11835,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Road was washed away by the Kasun River, and in the cup-like pastures"
11836,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,of Kashima the cattle waded knee-deep. The clouds dropped down from the
11837,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Dosehri hills and covered everything.
11838,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11839,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"At the end of the Rains, Boulte's manner toward his wife changed and"
11840,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"became demonstratively affectionate. They had been married twelve years,"
11841,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"and the change startled Mrs. Boulte, who hated her husband with the hate"
11842,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"of a woman who has met with nothing but kindness from her mate, and, in"
11843,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the teeth of this kindness, had done him a great wrong. Moreover,"
11844,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,she had her own trouble to fight with--her watch to keep over her own
11845,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"property, Kurrell. For two months the Rains had hidden the Dosehri hills"
11846,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"and many other things besides; but when they lifted, they showed Mrs."
11847,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte that her man among men, her Ted--for she called him Ted in the"
11848,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,old days when Boulte was out of earshot--was slipping the links of the
11849,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,allegiance.
11850,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11851,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""The Vansuythen Woman has taken him,"" Mrs. Boulte said to herself;"
11852,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"and when Boulte was away, wept over her belief, in the face of the"
11853,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,over-vehement blandishments of Ted. Sorrow in Kashima is as fortunate
11854,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"as Love, because there is nothing to weaken it save the flight of Time."
11855,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Mrs. Boulte had never breathed her suspicion to Kurrell because she was
11856,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,not certain; and her nature led her to be very certain before she took
11857,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,steps in any direction. That is why she behaved as she did.
11858,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11859,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte came into the house one evening, and leaned against the"
11860,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"door-posts of the drawing-room, chewing his moustache. Mrs. Boulte was"
11861,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,putting some flowers into a vase. There is a pretence of civilization
11862,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,even in Kashima.
11863,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11864,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Little woman,"" said Boulte, quietly, ""do you care for me?"""
11865,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11866,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Immensely,"" said she, with a laugh. ""Can you ask it?"""
11867,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11868,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""But I'm serious,"" said Boulte. ""Do you care for me?"""
11869,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11870,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Boulte dropped the flowers, and turned round quickly. ""Do you want"
11871,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"an honest answer?"""
11872,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11873,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Ye-es, I've asked for it."""
11874,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11875,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Boulte spoke in a low, even voice for five minutes, very"
11876,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"distinctly, that there might be no misunderstanding her meaning. When"
11877,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Samson broke the pillars of Gaza, he did a little thing, and one not to"
11878,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,be compared to the deliberate pulling down of a woman's homestead about
11879,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"her own ears. There was no wise female friend to advise Mrs. Boulte,"
11880,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the singularly cautious wife, to hold her hand. She struck at Boulte's"
11881,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"heart, because her own was sick with suspicion of Kurrell, and worn out"
11882,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,with the long strain of watching alone through the Rains. There was
11883,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,no plan or purpose in her speaking. The sentences made themselves; and
11884,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Boulte listened leaning against the door-post with his hands in his
11885,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"pockets. When all was over, and Mrs. Boulte began to breathe through her"
11886,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"nose before breaking out into tears, he laughed and stared straight in"
11887,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,front of him at the Dosehri hills.
11888,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11889,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Is that all?"" he said. ""Thanks, I only wanted to know, you know."""
11890,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11891,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""What are you going to do?"" said the woman, between her sobs."
11892,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11893,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Do! Nothing. What should I do? Kill Kurrell or send you Home, or"
11894,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"apply for leave to get a divorce? It's two days' dak into Narkarra."" He"
11895,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"laughed again and went on: ""I'll tell you what you can do. You can ask"
11896,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kurrell to dinner tomorrow--no, on Thursday, that will allow you time to"
11897,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"pack--and you can bolt with him. I give you my word I won't follow."""
11898,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11899,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"He took up his helmet and went out of the room, and Mrs. Boulte sat till"
11900,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the moonlight streaked the floor, thinking and thinking and thinking."
11901,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,She had done her best upon the spur of the moment to pull the house
11902,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"down; but it would not fall. Moreover, she could not understand her"
11903,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"husband, and she was afraid. Then the folly of her useless truthfulness"
11904,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"struck her, and she was ashamed to write to Kurrell, saying: ""I have"
11905,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,gone mad and told everything. My husband says that I am free to elope
11906,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"with you. Get a dak for Thursday, and we will fly after dinner."" There"
11907,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,was a cold-bloodedness about that procedure which did not appeal to her.
11908,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,So she sat still in her own house and thought.
11909,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11910,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"At dinner-time Boulte came back from his walk, white and worn and"
11911,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"haggard, and the woman was touched at his distress. As the evening wore"
11912,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"on, she muttered some expression of sorrow, something approaching to"
11913,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"contrition. Boulte came out of a brown study and said, ""Oh, that! I"
11914,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"wasn't thinking about that. By the way, what does Kurrell say to the"
11915,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"elopement?"""
11916,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11917,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I haven't seen him,"" said Mrs. Boulte. ""Good God! is that all?"""
11918,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11919,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"But Boulte was not listening, and her sentence ended in a gulp."
11920,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11921,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"The next day brought no comfort to Mrs. Boulte, for Kurrell did not"
11922,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"appear, and the new life that she, in the five minutes' madness of the"
11923,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"previous evening, had hoped to build out of the ruins of the old, seemed"
11924,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,to be no nearer.
11925,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11926,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte ate his breakfast, advised her to see her Arab pony fed in the"
11927,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"veranda, and went out. The morning wore through, and at midday the"
11928,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,tension became unendurable. Mrs. Boulte could not cry. She had finished
11929,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"her crying in the night, and now she did not want to be left alone."
11930,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Perhaps the Vansuythen woman would talk to her; and, since talking"
11931,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"opens the heart, perhaps there might be some comfort to be found in her"
11932,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,company. She was the only other woman in the Station.
11933,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11934,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,In Kashima there are no regular calling-hours. Every one can drop in
11935,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"upon every one else at pleasure. Mrs. Boulte put on a big terai hat, and"
11936,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,walked across to the Vansuythens's house to borrow last week's Queen.
11937,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"The two compounds touched, and instead of going up the drive, she"
11938,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"crossed through the gap in the cactus-hedge, entering the house from"
11939,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the back. As she passed through the dining-room, she heard, behind"
11940,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the purdah that cloaked the drawing-room door, her husband's voice,"
11941,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"saying--""But on my Honor! On my Soul and Honor, I tell you she doesn't"
11942,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,care for me. She told me so last night. I would have told you then if
11943,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Vansuythen hadn't been with you. If it is for her sake that you'll have
11944,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"nothing to say to me, you can make your mind easy. It's Kurrell."""
11945,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11946,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""What?"" said Mrs. Vansuythen, with an hysterical little laugh. ""Kurrell!"
11947,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Oh, it can't be. You two must have made some horrible mistake. Perhaps"
11948,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"you--you lost your temper, or misunderstood, or something. Things can't"
11949,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"be as wrong as you say."""
11950,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11951,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Vansuythen had shifted her defence to avoid the man's pleading, and"
11952,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,was desperately trying to keep him to a side-issue.
11953,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11954,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""There must be some mistake,"" she insisted, ""and it can be all put right"
11955,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"again."""
11956,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11957,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Boulte laughed grimly.
11958,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11959,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""It can't be Captain Kurrell! He told me that he had never taken the"
11960,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"least--the least interest in your wife, Mr. Boulte. Oh, do listen! He"
11961,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"said he had not. He swore he had not,"" said Mrs. Vansuythen."
11962,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11963,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"The purdah rustled, and the speech was cut short by the entry of a"
11964,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"little, thin woman with big rings round her eyes. Mrs. Vansuythen stood"
11965,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,up with a gasp.
11966,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11967,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""What was that you said?"" asked Mrs. Boulte. ""Never mind that man. What"
11968,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"did Ted say to you? What did he say to you? What did he say to you?"""
11969,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11970,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Vansuythen sat down helplessly on the sofa, overborne by the"
11971,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,trouble of her questioner.
11972,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11973,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""He said--I can't remember exactly what he said--but I understood him"
11974,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to say--that is--But, really, Mrs. Boulte, isn't it rather a strange"
11975,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"question?"""
11976,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11977,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Will you tell me what he said?"" repeated Mrs. Boulte."
11978,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11979,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Even a tiger will fly before a bear robbed of her whelps, and Mrs."
11980,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Vansuythen was only an ordinarily good woman. She began in a sort of
11981,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"desperation: ""Well, he said that he never cared for you at all, and,"
11982,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"of course, there was not the least reason why he should have,"
11983,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"and--and--that was all."""
11984,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11985,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""You said he swore he had not cared for me. Was that true?"""
11986,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11987,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Yes,"" said Mrs. Vansuythen, very softly."
11988,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11989,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Boulte wavered for an instant where she stood, and then fell"
11990,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,forward fainting.
11991,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11992,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""What did I tell you?"" said Boulte, as though the conversation had been"
11993,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"unbroken. ""You can see for yourself she cares for him."" The light began"
11994,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to break into his dull mind, and he went on--""And he--what was he saying"
11995,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to you?"""
11996,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
11997,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"But Mrs. Vansuythen, with no heart for explanations or impassioned"
11998,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"protestations, was kneeling over Mrs. Boulte."
11999,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12000,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Oh, you brute!"" she cried. ""Are all men like this? Help me to get her"
12001,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"into my room--and her face is cut against the table. Oh, will you be"
12002,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"quiet, and help me to carry her? I hate you, and I hate Captain Kurrell."
12003,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Lift her up carefully and now--go! Go away!"""
12004,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12005,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Boulte carried his wife into Mrs. Vansuythen's bedroom and departed
12006,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"before the storm of that lady's wrath and disgust, impenitent"
12007,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,and burning with jealousy. Kurrell had been making love to Mrs.
12008,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Vansuythen--would do Vansuythen as great a wrong as he had done Boulte,"
12009,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,who caught himself considering whether Mrs. Vansuythen would faint if
12010,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,she discovered that the man she loved had foresworn her.
12011,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12012,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"In the middle of these meditations, Kurrell came cantering along the"
12013,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"road and pulled up with a cheery, ""Good mornin'. 'Been mashing Mrs."
12014,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Vansuythen as usual, eh? Bad thing for a sober, married man, that. What"
12015,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"will Mrs Boulte say?"""
12016,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12017,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte raised his head and said, slowly, ""Oh, you liar!"""
12018,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12019,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kurrell's face changed. ""What's that?"" he asked, quickly."
12020,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12021,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Nothing much,"" said Boulte. ""Has my wife told you that you two are free"
12022,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,to go off whenever you please? She has been good enough to explain
12023,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the situation to me. You've been a true friend to me, Kurrell--old"
12024,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"man--haven't you?"""
12025,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12026,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kurrell groaned, and tried to frame some sort of idiotic sentence about"
12027,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"being willing to give ""satisfaction."" But his interest in the woman was"
12028,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"dead, had died out in the Rains, and, mentally, he was abusing her for"
12029,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,her amazing indiscretion. It would have been so easy to have broken off
12030,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the thing gently and by degrees, and now he was saddled with--Boulte's"
12031,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,voice recalled him.
12032,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12033,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I don't think I should get any satisfaction from killing you, and I'm"
12034,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"pretty sure you'd get none from killing me."""
12035,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12036,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Then in a querulous tone, ludicrously disproportioned to his wrongs,"
12037,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte added--""'Seems rather a pity that you haven't the decency to keep"
12038,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to the woman, now you've got her. You've been a true friend to her too,"
12039,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"haven't you?"""
12040,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12041,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Kurrell stared long and gravely. The situation was getting beyond him.
12042,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12043,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""What do you mean?"" he said."
12044,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12045,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte answered, more to himself than the questioner: ""My wife came"
12046,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,over to Mrs. Vansuythen's just now; and it seems you'd been telling
12047,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Vansuythen that you'd never cared for Emma. I suppose you lied, as"
12048,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"usual. What had Mrs. Vansuythen to do with you, or you with her? Try to"
12049,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"speak the truth for once in a way."""
12050,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12051,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kurrell took the double insult without wincing, and replied by another"
12052,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"question: ""Go on. What happened?"""
12053,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12054,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Emma fainted,"" said Boulte, simply. ""But, look here, what had you been"
12055,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"saying to Mrs. Vansuythen?"""
12056,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12057,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Kurrell laughed. Mrs. Boulte had, with unbridled tongue, made havoc of"
12058,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,his plans; and he could at least retaliate by hurting the man in whose
12059,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,eyes he was humiliated and shown dishonorable.
12060,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12061,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Said to her? What does a man tell a lie like that for? I suppose I said"
12062,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"pretty much what you've said, unless I'm a good deal mistaken."""
12063,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12064,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I spoke the truth,"" said Boulte, again more to himself than Kurrell."
12065,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Emma told me she hated me. She has no right in me."""
12066,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12067,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""No! I suppose not. You're only her husband, y'know. And what did Mrs."
12068,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Vansuythen say after you had laid your disengaged heart at her feet?"""
12069,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12070,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Kurrell felt almost virtuous as he put the question.
12071,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12072,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I don't think that matters,"" Boulte replied; ""and it doesn't concern"
12073,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"you."""
12074,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12075,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""But it does! I tell you it does"" began Kurrell, shamelessly."
12076,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12077,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,The sentence was cut by a roar of laughter from Boulte's lips. Kurrell
12078,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"was silent for an instant, and then he, too, laughed--laughed long and"
12079,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"loudly, rocking in his saddle. It was an unpleasant sound--the mirthless"
12080,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"mirth of these men on the long, white line of the Narkarra Road. There"
12081,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"were no strangers in Kashima, or they might have thought that captivity"
12082,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,within the Dosehri hills had driven half the European population mad.
12083,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"The laughter ended abruptly, and Kurrell was the first to speak."
12084,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12085,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Well, what are you going to do?"""
12086,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12087,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boulte looked up the road, and at the hills. ""Nothing,"" said he,"
12088,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"quietly; ""what's the use? It's too ghastly for anything. We must let the"
12089,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"old life go on. I can only call you a hound and a liar, and I can't go"
12090,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"on calling you names forever. Besides which, I don't feel that I'm much"
12091,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"better. We can't get out of this place. What is there to do?"""
12092,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12093,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Kurrell looked round the rat-pit of Kashima and made no reply. The
12094,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,injured husband took up the wondrous tale.
12095,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12096,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Ride on, and speak to Emma if you want to. God knows I don't care what"
12097,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"you do."""
12098,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12099,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,He walked forward and left Kurrell gazing blankly after him. Kurrell did
12100,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,not ride on either to see Mrs. Boulte or Mrs. Vansuythen. He sat in his
12101,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"saddle and thought, while his pony grazed by the roadside."
12102,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12103,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,The whir of approaching wheels roused him. Mrs. Vansuythen was driving
12104,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"home Mrs. Boulte, white and wan, with a cut on her forehead."
12105,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12106,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Stop, please,"" said Mrs. Boulte ""I want to speak to Ted."""
12107,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12108,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Vansuythen obeyed, but as Mrs. Boulte leaned forward, putting her"
12109,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"hand upon the splash-board of the dog-cart, Kurrell spoke."
12110,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12111,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I've seen your husband, Mrs. Boulte."""
12112,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12113,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,There was no necessity for any further explanation. The man's eyes were
12114,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"fixed, not upon Mrs. Boulte, but her companion. Mrs. Boulte saw the"
12115,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,look.
12116,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12117,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Speak to him!"" she pleaded, turning to the woman at her side. ""Oh,"
12118,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,speak to him! Tell him what you told me just now. Tell him you hate him.
12119,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Tell him you hate him!"""
12120,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12121,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"She bent forward and wept bitterly, while the sais, impassive, went"
12122,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,forward to hold the horse. Mrs. Vansuythen turned scarlet and dropped
12123,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the reins. She wished to be no party to such unholy explanations.
12124,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12125,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I've nothing to do with it,"" she began, coldly; but Mrs. Boulte's sobs"
12126,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"overcame her, and she addressed herself to the man. ""I don't know what"
12127,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"I am to say, Captain Kurrell. I don't know what I can call you. I think"
12128,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"you've--you've behaved abominably, and she has cut her forehead terribly"
12129,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"against the table."""
12130,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12131,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""It doesn't hurt. It isn't anything,"" said Mrs. Boulte feebly. ""That"
12132,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,doesn't matter. Tell him what you told me. Say you don't care for him.
12133,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Oh, Ted, won't you believe her?"""
12134,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12135,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Mrs. Boulte has made me understand that you were--that you were fond of"
12136,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"her once upon a time,"" went on Mrs. Vansuythen."
12137,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12138,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Well!"" said Kurrell brutally. ""It seems to me that Mrs. Boulte had"
12139,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"better be fond of her own husband first."""
12140,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12141,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Stop!"" said Mrs. Vansuythen. ""Hear me first. I don't care--I don't want"
12142,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,to know anything about you and Mrs. Boulte; but I want you to know that
12143,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"I hate you, that I think you are a cur, and that I'll never, never speak"
12144,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"to you again. Oh, I don't dare to say what I think of you, you--man!"
12145,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"_Sais,_ gorah _ko_ jane _do_."""
12146,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12147,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""I want to speak to Ted,"" moaned Mrs. Boulte, but the dog-cart rattled"
12148,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"on, and Kurrell was left on the road, shamed, and boiling with wrath"
12149,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,against Mrs. Boulte.
12150,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12151,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"He waited till Mrs. Vansuythen was driving back to her own house,"
12152,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"and, she being freed from the embarrassment of Mrs. Boulte's presence,"
12153,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,learned for the second time her opinion of himself and his actions.
12154,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12155,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"In the evenings, it was the wont of all Kashima to meet at the platform"
12156,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"on the Narkarra Road, to drink tea, and discuss the trivialities of"
12157,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the day. Major Vansuythen and his wife found themselves alone at the
12158,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,gathering-place for almost the first time in their remembrance; and
12159,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the cheery Major, in the teeth of his wife's remarkably reasonable"
12160,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"suggestion that the rest of the Station might be sick, insisted upon"
12161,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,driving round to the two bungalows and unearthing the population.
12162,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12163,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""Sitting in the twilight!"" said he, with great indignation to the"
12164,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Boultes. ""That'll never do! Hang it all, we're one family here! You must"
12165,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"come out, and so must Kurrell. I'll make him bring his banjo."" So great"
12166,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,is the power of honest simplicity and a good digestion over guilty
12167,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"consciences that all Kashima did turn out, even down to the banjo; and"
12168,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"the Major embraced the company in one expansive grin. As he grinned,"
12169,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Mrs. Vansuythen raised her eyes for an instant and looked at all
12170,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Kashima. Her meaning was clear. Major Vansuythen would never know
12171,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,anything. He was to be the outsider in that happy family whose cage was
12172,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,the Dosehri hills.
12173,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12174,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""You're singing villainously out of tune, Kurrell,"" said the Major,"
12175,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"truthfully. ""Pass me that banjo."""
12176,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12177,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,And he sang in excruciating-wise till the stars came out and all Kashima
12178,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,went to dinner.
12179,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12180,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,* * * * *
12181,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12182,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,That was the beginning of the New Life of Kashima--the life that Mrs.
12183,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Boulte made when her tongue was loosened in the twilight.
12184,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12185,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Mrs. Vansuythen has never told the Major; and since be insists upon
12186,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"keeping up a burdensome geniality, she has been compelled to break her"
12187,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"vow of not speaking to Kurrell. This speech, which must of necessity"
12188,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"preserve the semblance of politeness and interest, serves admirably to"
12189,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"keep alive the flame of jealousy and dull hatred in Boulte's bosom, as"
12190,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,it awakens the same passions in his wife's heart. Mrs. Boulte hates
12191,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Mrs. Vansuythen because she has taken Ted from her, and, in some curious"
12192,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"fashion, hates her because Mrs. Vansuythen--and here the wife's eyes see"
12193,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,far more clearly than the husband's--detests Ted. And Ted--that gallant
12194,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,captain and honorable man--knows now that it is possible to hate a woman
12195,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"once loved, to the verge of wishing to silence her forever with blows."
12196,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"Above all, is he shocked that Mrs. Boulte cannot see the error of her"
12197,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,ways.
12198,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12199,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Boulte and he go out tiger-shooting together in all friendship. Boulte
12200,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,has put their relationship on a most satisfactory footing.
12201,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12202,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"""You're a blackguard,"" he says to Kurrell, ""and I've lost any"
12203,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"self-respect I may ever have had; but when you're with me, I can"
12204,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"feel certain that you are not with Mrs. Vansuythen, or making Emma"
12205,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"miserable."""
12206,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,
12207,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,Kurrell endures anything that Boulte may say to him. Sometimes they are
12208,A WAYSIDE COMEDY,"away for three days together, and then the Major insists upon his"

12226,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,--Matthew Arnold.
12227,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12228,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Tell your jhampanis not to hurry so, dear. They forget I'm fresh"
12229,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,from the Plains.
12230,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12231,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Sure proof that I have not been going out with any one. Yes, they"
12232,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,are an untrained crew. Where do we go?
12233,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12234,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. As usual--to the world's end. No, Jakko."
12235,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12236,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Have your pony led after you, then. It's a long round."
12237,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12238,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. And for the last time, thank Heaven!"
12239,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12240,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Do you mean that still? I didn't dare to write to you about
12241,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,it... all these months.
12242,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12243,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Mean it! I've been shaping my affairs to that end since Autumn. What
12244,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,makes you speak as though it had occurred to you for the first time?
12245,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12246,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. I! Oh! I don't know. I've had long enough to think, too."
12247,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12248,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. And you've changed your mind?
12249,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12250,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. No. You ought to know that I am a miracle of constancy. What are
12251,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,your--arrangements?
12252,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12253,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Ours, Sweetheart, please."
12254,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12255,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Ours, be it then. My poor boy, how the prickly heat has marked your"
12256,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,forehead! Have you ever tried sulphate of copper in water?
12257,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12258,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. It'll go away in a day or two up here. The arrangements are simple
12259,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,enough. Tonga in the early morning--reach Kalka at twelve--Umballa at
12260,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"seven--down, straight by night train, to Bombay, and then the steamer of"
12261,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,the 21st for Rome. That's my idea. The Continent and Sweden--a ten-week
12262,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,honeymoon.
12263,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12264,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Ssh! Don't talk of it in that way. It makes me afraid. Guy, how"
12265,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,long have we two been insane?
12266,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12267,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Seven months and fourteen days; I forget the odd hours exactly, but"
12268,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,I'll think.
12269,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12270,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I only wanted to see if you remembered. Who are those two on the
12271,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Blessington Road?
12272,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12273,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Eabrey and the Penner woman. What do they matter to us? Tell me
12274,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,everything that you've been doing and saying and thinking.
12275,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12276,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Doing little, saying less, and thinking a great deal. I've hardly"
12277,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,been out at all.
12278,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12279,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Ha. That was wrong of you. You haven't been moping?
12280,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12281,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Not very much. Can you wonder that I'm disinclined for amusement?
12282,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12283,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Frankly, I do. Where was the difficulty?"
12284,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12285,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. In this only. The more people I know and the more I'm known here,"
12286,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,the wider spread will be the news of the crash when it comes. I don't
12287,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,like that.
12288,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12289,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Nonsense. We shall be out of it.
12290,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12291,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. You think so?
12292,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12293,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. I'm sure of it, if there is any power in steam or horse-flesh to"
12294,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,carry us away. Ha! ha!
12295,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12296,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. And the fun of the situation comes in--where, my Lancelot?"
12297,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12298,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Nowhere, Guinevere. I was only thinking of something."
12299,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12300,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. They say men have a keener sense of humor than women. Now _I_ was
12301,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,thinking of the scandal.
12302,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12303,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Don't think of anything so ugly. We shall be beyond it.
12304,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12305,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. It will be there all the same in the mouths of Simla--telegraphed
12306,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"over India, and talked of at the dinners--and when He goes out they"
12307,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"will stare at Him to see how He takes it. And we shall be dead, Guy"
12308,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,dear--dead and cast into the outer darkness where there is--
12309,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12310,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Love at least. Isn't that enough?
12311,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12312,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I have said so.
12313,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12314,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. And you think so still?
12315,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12316,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. What do you think?
12317,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12318,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Ha. What have I _done_? It means equal ruin to me, as the world reckons"
12319,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"it--outcasting, the loss of my appointment, the breaking of my life's"
12320,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,work. I pay my price.
12321,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12322,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. And are you so much above the world that you can afford to pay it?
12323,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Am I?
12324,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12325,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Ha. My Divinity--what else?
12326,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12327,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. A very ordinary woman I'm afraid, but, so far, respectable. How'd"
12328,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"you do, Mrs. Middleditch? Your husband? I think he's riding down"
12329,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"to Annandale with Colonel Statters. Yes, isn't it divine after the"
12330,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"rain?--Guy, how long am I to be allowed to bow to Mrs. Middleditch? Till"
12331,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,the 17th?
12332,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12333,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Frowsy Scotchwoman? What is the use of bringing her into the
12334,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,discussion? You were saying?
12335,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12336,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Nothing. Have you ever seen a man hanged?
12337,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12338,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Yes. Once.
12339,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12340,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. What was it for?
12341,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12342,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Murder, of course."
12343,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12344,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Murder. Is that so great a sin after all? I wonder how he felt
12345,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,before the drop fell.
12346,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12347,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I don't think he felt much. What a gruesome little woman it is this
12348,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"evening! You're shivering. Put on your cape, dear."
12349,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12350,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I think I will. Oh! Look at the mist coming over Sanjaoli; and I
12351,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,thought we should have sunshine on the Ladies' Mile! Let's turn back.
12352,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12353,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. What's the good? There's a cloud on Elysium Hill, and that means"
12354,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,it's foggy all down the Mall. We'll go on. It'll blow away before we get
12355,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"to the Convent, perhaps. 'Jove! It is chilly."
12356,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12357,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. You feel it, fresh from below. Put on your ulster. What do you"
12358,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,think of my cape?
12359,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12360,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Never ask a man his opinion of a woman's dress when he is
12361,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,desperately and abjectly in love with the wearer. Let me look. Like
12362,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,everything else of yours it's perfect. Where did you get it from?
12363,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12364,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. He gave it me, on Wednesday... our wedding-day, you know."
12365,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12366,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. The deuce He did! He's growing generous in his old age. D'you like
12367,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat? I don't."
12368,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12369,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Don't you?
12370,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12371,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"""Kind Sir, O' your courtesy,"
12372,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"As you go by the town, Sir,"
12373,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Pray you O' your love for me,"
12374,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Buy me a russet gown, Sir."""
12375,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12376,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. I won't say: ""Keek into the draw-well, Janet, Janet."" Only wait a"
12377,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"little, darling, and you shall be stocked with russet gowns and"
12378,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,everything else.
12379,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12380,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. And when the frocks wear out, you'll get me new ones--and"
12381,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,everything else?
12382,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12383,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Assuredly.
12384,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12385,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I wonder!
12386,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12387,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Look here, Sweetheart, I didn't spend two days and two nights in"
12388,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,the train to hear you wonder. I thought we'd settled all that at
12389,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Shaifazehat.
12390,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12391,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE (dreamily). At Shaifazehat? Does the Station go on still? That
12392,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,was ages and ages ago. It must be crumbling to pieces. All except the
12393,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Amirtollah kutcha road. I don't believe that could crumble till the Day
12394,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,of Judgment.
12395,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12396,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Ha. You think so? What is the mood now?
12397,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12398,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I can't tell. How cold it is! Let us get on quickly.
12399,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12400,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Ha. Better walk a little. Stop your jhampanis and get out. What's the
12401,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"matter with you this evening, dear?"
12402,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12403,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Nothing. You must grow accustomed to my ways. If I'm boring you
12404,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,I can go home. Here's Captain Congleton coming; I dare say he'll be
12405,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,willing to escort me.
12406,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12407,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Ha. Goose! Between us, too! Damn Captain Congleton. There!"
12408,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12409,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Chivalrous Knight! Is it your habit to swear much in talking? It
12410,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"jars a little, and you might swear at me."
12411,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12412,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. My angel! I didn't know what I was saying; and you changed so
12413,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,quickly that I couldn't follow. I'll apologize in dust and ashes.
12414,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12415,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. There'll be enough of those later on. Good night, Captain"
12416,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Congleton. Going to the singing-quadrilles already? What dances am I
12417,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,giving you next week? No! You must have written them down wrong. Five
12418,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"and Seven, I said. If you've made a mistake, I certainly don't intend to"
12419,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,suffer for it. You must alter your programme.
12420,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12421,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I thought you told me that you had not been going out much this
12422,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,season?
12423,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12424,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Quite true, but when I do I dance with Captain Congleton. He dances"
12425,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,very nicely.
12426,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12427,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. And sit out with him, I suppose?"
12428,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12429,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Yes. Have you any objection? Shall I stand under the chandelier in
12430,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,future?
12431,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12432,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. What does he talk to you about?
12433,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12434,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. What do men talk about when they sit out?
12435,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12436,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Ha. Ugh! Don't! Well now I'm up, you must dispense with the fascinating"
12437,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,Congleton for a while. I don't like him.
12438,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12439,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. (after a pause). Do you know what you have said?
12440,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12441,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. 'Can't say that I do exactly. I'm not in the best of tempers.
12442,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12443,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. So I see... and feel. My true and faithful lover, where is your"
12444,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"""eternal constancy,"" ""unalterable trust,"" and ""reverent devotion""? I"
12445,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,remember those phrases; you seem to have forgotten them. I mention a
12446,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,man's name--
12447,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12448,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. A good deal more than that.
12449,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12450,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Well, speak to him about a dance--perhaps the last dance that I"
12451,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,shall ever dance in my life before I... before I go away; and you at once
12452,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,distrust and insult me.
12453,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12454,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I never said a word.
12455,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12456,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. How much did you imply? Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our"
12457,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,stock to start the new life on?
12458,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12459,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. No, of course not. I didn't mean that. On my word of honor, I"
12460,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"didn't. Let it pass, dear. Please let it pass."
12461,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12462,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. This once--yes--and a second time, and again and again, all through"
12463,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"the years when I shall be unable to resent it. You want too much, my"
12464,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Lancelot, and... you know too much."
12465,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12466,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. How do you mean?
12467,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12468,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. That is a part of the punishment. There cannot be perfect trust
12469,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,between us.
12470,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12471,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. In Heaven's name, why not?"
12472,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12473,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Hush! The Other Place is quite enough. Ask yourself.
12474,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12475,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I don't follow.
12476,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12477,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. You trust me so implicitly that when I look at another man--Never
12478,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"mind, Guy. Have you ever made love to a girl--a good girl?"
12479,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12480,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Something of the sort. Centuries ago--in the Dark Ages, before I"
12481,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"ever met you, dear."
12482,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12483,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Tell me what you said to her.
12484,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12485,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. What does a man say to a girl? I've forgotten.
12486,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12487,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I remember. He tells her that he trusts her and worships the ground
12488,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"she walks on, and that he'll love and honor and protect her till her"
12489,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"dying day; and so she marries in that belief. At least, I speak of one"
12490,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,girl who was not protected.
12491,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12492,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Well, and then?"
12493,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12494,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. And then, Guy, and then, that girl needs ten times the love and"
12495,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"trust and honor--yes, honor--that was enough when she was only a mere"
12496,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,wife if--if--the other life she chooses to lead is to be made even
12497,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,bearable. Do you understand?
12498,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12499,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Even bearable! It'll he Paradise.
12500,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12501,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Ah! Can you give me all I've asked for--not now, nor a few months"
12502,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"later, but when you begin to think of what you might have done if you"
12503,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,had kept your own appointment and your caste here--when you begin to
12504,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"look upon me as a drag and a burden? I shall want it most, then, Guy,"
12505,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,for there will be no one in the wide world but you.
12506,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12507,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. You're a little over-tired tonight, Sweetheart, and you're taking a"
12508,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"stage view of the situation. After the necessary business in the Courts,"
12509,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,the road is clear to--
12510,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12511,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. ""The holy state of matrimony!"" Ha! ha! ha!"
12512,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12513,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Ssh! Don't laugh in that horrible way!
12514,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12515,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. I-I c-c-c-can't help it! Isn't it too absurd! Ah! Ha! ha! ha! Guy,"
12516,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,stop me quick or I shall--l-l-laugh till we get to the Church.
12517,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12518,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. For goodness' sake, stop! Don't make an exhibition of yourself. What"
12519,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,is the matter with you?
12520,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12521,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. N-nothing. I'm better now.
12522,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12523,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. That's all right. One moment, dear. There's a little wisp of hair"
12524,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,got loose from behind your right ear and it's straggling over your
12525,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,cheek. So!
12526,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12527,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Thank'oo. I'm 'fraid my hat's on one side, too."
12528,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12529,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. What do you wear these huge dagger bonnet-skewers for? They're big
12530,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,enough to kill a man with.
12531,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12532,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Oh! Don't kill me, though. You're sticking it into my head! Let me"
12533,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,do it. You men are so clumsy.
12534,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12535,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Have you had many opportunities of comparing us--in this sort of
12536,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,work?
12537,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12538,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Guy, what is my name?"
12539,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12540,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Eh! I don't follow.
12541,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12542,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Here's my cardcase. Can you read?
12543,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12544,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Yes. Well?
12545,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12546,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Well, that answers your question. You know the other man's name. Am"
12547,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"I sufficiently humbled, or would you like to ask me if there is any one"
12548,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,else?

12556,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12557,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Unreasonable man! Who asked me to face the situation and accept

12559,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"Swear I don't! Give me your word of honor, my honorable friend, that I'm"

12592,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12593,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Moods, Guy! I haven't any. I'm sixteen years old and you're just"

12605,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,pleased with your performances?
12606,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12607,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. One or two. One can't make omelets without breaking eggs.
12608,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12609,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE (slowly). I don't see the necessity--
12610,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12611,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Hah! What do you mean?
12612,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12613,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. Shall I speak the truth?
12614,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12615,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Under the circumstances, perhaps it would be as well."

12617,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Guy, I'm afraid."
12618,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12619,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I thought we'd settled all that. What of?

12629,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. What do you think of me?
12630,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12631,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Beside the question altogether. What do you intend to do?
12632,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12633,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I daren't risk it. I'm afraid. If I could only cheat--
12634,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12635,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. A la Buzgago? No, thanks. That's the one point on which I have any"
12636,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,notion of Honor. I won't eat his salt and steal too. I'll loot openly or
12637,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,not at all.
12638,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12639,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. I never meant anything else.
12640,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12641,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. Then, why in the world do you pretend not to be willing to come?"
12642,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12643,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. It's not pretence, Guy. I am afraid."
12644,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12645,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Please explain.
12646,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12647,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. It can't last, Guy. It can't last. You'll get angry, and then"
12648,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"you'll swear, and then you'll get jealous, and then you'll mistrust"
12649,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,me--you do now--and you yourself will be the best reason for doubting.
12650,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,And I--what shall I do? I shall be no better than Mrs. Buzgago found

12652,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,see?
12653,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12654,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"HE. I see that you are desperately unreasonable, little woman."
12655,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12656,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. There! The moment I begin to object, you get angry. What will you"
12657,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"do when I am only your property--stolen property? It can't be, Guy. It"
12658,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"can't be! I thought it could, but it can't. You'll get tired of me."
12659,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12660,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I tell you I shall not. Won't anything make you understand that?
12661,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12662,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. There, can't you see? If you speak to me like that now, you'll call"
12663,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"me horrible names later, if I don't do everything as you like. And if"
12664,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"you were cruel to me, Guy, where should I go--where should I go? I can't"
12665,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,trust you. Oh! I can't trust you!
12666,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12667,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I suppose I ought to say that I can trust you. I've ample reason.
12668,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12669,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Please don't, dear. It hurts as much as if you hit me."
12670,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12671,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. It isn't exactly pleasant for me.
12672,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12673,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. I can't help it. I wish I were dead! I can't trust you, and I don't"
12674,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"trust myself. Oh, Guy, let it die away and be forgotten!"
12675,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12676,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. Too late now. I don't understand you--I won't--and I can't trust
12677,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,myself to talk this evening. May I call tomorrow?
12678,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12679,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,"SHE. Yes. No! Oh, give me time! The day after. I get into my 'rickshaw"
12680,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,here and meet Him at Peliti's. You ride.
12681,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12682,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,HE. I'll go on to Peliti's too. I think I want a drink. My world's
12683,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,knocked about my ears and the stars are falling. Who are those brutes
12684,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,howling in the Old Library?
12685,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,
12686,THE HILL OF ILLUSION,SHE. They're rehearsing the singing-quadrilles for the Fancy Ball. Can't

13554,ONLY A SUBALTERN,THEY made Bobby Wick pass an examination at Sandhurst. He was a
13555,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"gentleman before he was gazetted, so, when the Empress announced that"
13556,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Gentleman-Cadet Robert Hanna Wick"" was posted as Second Lieutenant to"
13557,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Tyneside Tail Twisters at Kram Bokhar, he became an officer and a"
13558,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"gentleman, which is an enviable thing; and there was joy in the house of"
13559,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Wick where Mamma Wick and all the little Wicks fell upon their knees and
13560,ONLY A SUBALTERN,offered incense to Bobby by virtue of his achievements.
13561,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13562,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Papa Wick had been a Commissioner in his day, holding authority over"
13563,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"three millions of men in the Chota-Buldana Division, building great"
13564,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"works for the good of the land, and doing his best to make two blades"
13565,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"of grass grow where there was but one before. Of course, nobody knew"
13566,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"anything about this in the little English village where he was just ""old"
13567,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Mr. Wick"" and had forgotten that he was a Companion of the Order of the"
13568,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Star of India.
13569,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13570,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"He patted Bobby on the shoulder and said: ""Well done, my boy!"""
13571,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13572,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"There followed, while the uniform was being prepared, an interval of"
13573,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"pure delight, during which Bobby took brevet-rank as a ""man"" at the"

13575,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"say, had his joining-time been extended, would have fallen in love with"
13576,ONLY A SUBALTERN,several girls at once. Little country villages at Home are very full of

13588,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"keep within your allowance, and I haven't stinted you there, stick to"
13589,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Line, the whole Line and nothing but the Line. Be careful how you"
13590,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"back another young fool's bill, and if you fall in love with a woman"
13591,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"twenty years older than yourself, don't tell me about it, that's all."""
13592,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13593,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"With these counsels, and many others equally valuable, did Papa Wick"
13594,ONLY A SUBALTERN,fortify Bobby ere that last awful night at Portsmouth when the Officers'
13595,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Quarters held more inmates than were provided for by the Regulations,"
13596,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"and the liberty-men of the ships fell foul of the drafts for India, and"
13597,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the battle raged from the Dockyard Gates even to the slums of Longport,"

13603,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"to attend to, had no time to feel homesick till the Malabar reached"
13604,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"mid-Channel, when he doubled his emotions with a little guard-visiting"
13605,ONLY A SUBALTERN,and a great many other matters.
13606,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13607,ONLY A SUBALTERN,The Tail Twisters were a most particular Regiment. Those who knew them
13608,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"least said that they were eaten up with ""side."" But their reserve and"
13609,ONLY A SUBALTERN,their internal arrangements generally were merely protective diplomacy.
13610,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Some five years before, the Colonel commanding had looked into the"
13611,ONLY A SUBALTERN,fourteen fearless eyes of seven plump and juicy subalterns who had all
13612,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"applied to enter the Staff Corps, and had asked them why the three"
13613,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"stars should he, a colonel of the Line, command a dashed nursery for"
13614,ONLY A SUBALTERN,double-dashed bottle-suckers who put on condemned tin spurs and rode
13615,ONLY A SUBALTERN,qualified mokes at the hiatused heads of forsaken Black Regiments. He
13616,ONLY A SUBALTERN,was a rude man and a terrible. Wherefore the remnant took measures [with
13617,ONLY A SUBALTERN,the half-butt as an engine of public opinion] till the rumor went abroad
13618,ONLY A SUBALTERN,that young men who used the Tail Twisters as a crutch to the Staff
13619,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Corps, had many and varied trials to endure. However a regiment had just"
13620,ONLY A SUBALTERN,as much right to its own secrets as a woman.
13621,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13622,ONLY A SUBALTERN,When Bobby came up from Deolali and took his place among the Tail
13623,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Twisters, it was gently But firmly borne in upon him that the Regiment"
13624,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"was his father and his mother and his indissolubly wedded wife, and"
13625,ONLY A SUBALTERN,that there was no crime under the canopy of heaven blacker than that
13626,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"of bringing shame on the Regiment, which was the best-shooting,"
13627,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"best-drilled, best-set-up, bravest, most illustrious, and in all"
13628,ONLY A SUBALTERN,respects most desirable Regiment within the compass of the Seven Seas.
13629,ONLY A SUBALTERN,He was taught the legends of the Mess Plate from the great grinning
13630,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Golden Gods that had come out of the Summer Palace in Pekin to the
13631,ONLY A SUBALTERN,silver-mounted markhor-horn snuff-mull presented by the last C. 0. [he
13632,ONLY A SUBALTERN,who spake to the seven subalterns]. And every one of those legends told
13633,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"him of battles fought at long odds, without fear as without support; of"
13634,ONLY A SUBALTERN,hospitality catholic as an Arab's; of friendships deep as the sea and
13635,ONLY A SUBALTERN,steady as the fighting-line; of honor won by hard roads for honor's
13636,ONLY A SUBALTERN,sake; and of instant and unquestioning devotion to the Regiment--the
13637,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Regiment that claims the lives of all and lives forever.
13638,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13639,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"More than once, too, he came officially into contact with the Regimental"
13640,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"colors, which looked like the lining of a bricklayer's hat on the end"
13641,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"of a chewed stick. Bobby did not kneel and worship them, because British"
13642,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"subalterns are not constructed in that manner. Indeed, he condemned them"
13643,ONLY A SUBALTERN,for their weight at the very moment that they were filling with awe and
13644,ONLY A SUBALTERN,other more noble sentiments.
13645,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13646,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"But best of all was the occasion when he moved with the Tail Twisters,"
13647,ONLY A SUBALTERN,in review order at the breaking of a November day. Allowing for duty-men
13648,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"and sick, the Regiment was one thousand and eighty strong, and Bobby"
13649,ONLY A SUBALTERN,belonged to them; for was he not a Subaltern of the Line the whole Line
13650,ONLY A SUBALTERN,and nothing but the Line--as the tramp of two thousand one hundred and
13651,ONLY A SUBALTERN,sixty sturdy ammunition boots attested. He would not have changed places
13652,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"with Deighton of the Horse Battery, whirling by in a pillar of cloud"
13653,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"to a chorus of ""Strong right! Strong left!"" or Hogan-Yale of the White"
13654,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Hussars, leading his squadron for all it was worth, with the price of"
13655,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"horseshoes thrown in; or ""Tick"" Boileau, trying to live up to his fierce"
13656,ONLY A SUBALTERN,blue and gold turban while the wasps of the Bengal Cavalry stretched
13657,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"to a gallop in the wake of the long, lollopping Walers of the White"
13658,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Hussars.
13659,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13660,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"They fought through the clear cool day, and Bobby felt a little thrill"
13661,ONLY A SUBALTERN,run down his spine when he heard the tinkle-tinkle-tinkle of the empty
13662,ONLY A SUBALTERN,cartridge-cases hopping from the breech-blocks after the roar of the
13663,ONLY A SUBALTERN,volleys; for he knew that he should live to hear that sound in action.
13664,ONLY A SUBALTERN,The review ended in a glorious chase across the plain--batteries
13665,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"thundering after cavalry to the huge disgust of the White Hussars, and"
13666,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Tyneside Tail Twisters hunting a Sikh Regiment, till the lean lathy"
13667,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Singhs panted with exhaustion. Bobby was dusty and dripping long before
13668,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"noon, but his enthusiasm was merely focused--not diminished."
13669,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13670,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"He returned to sit at the feet of Revere, his ""skipper,"" that is to say,"
13671,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Captain of his Company, and to be instructed in the dark art and"
13672,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"mystery of managing men, which is a very large part of the Profession of"
13673,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Arms.
13674,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13675,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""If you haven't a taste that way,"" said Revere, between his puffs of"
13676,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"his cheroot, ""you'll never be able to get the hang of it, but remember"
13677,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Bobby, 'tisn't the best drill, though drill is nearly everything, that"
13678,ONLY A SUBALTERN,hauls a Regiment through Hell and out on the other side. It's the man
13679,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"who knows how to handle men--goat-men, swine-men, dog-men, and so on."""
13680,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13681,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Dormer, for instance,"" said Bobby. ""I think he comes under the head of"
13682,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"fool-men. He mopes like a sick owl."""
13683,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13684,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""That's where you make your mistake, my son. Dormer isn't a fool yet,"
13685,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"but he's a dashed dirty soldier, and his room corporal makes fun of his"
13686,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"socks before kit-inspection. Dormer, being two-thirds pure brute, goes"
13687,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"into a corner and growls."""
13688,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13689,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""How do you know?"" said Bobby, admiringly."
13690,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13691,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Because a Company commander has to know these things--because, if he"
13692,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"does not know, he may have crime--ay, murder--brewing under his very"

13703,ONLY A SUBALTERN,reflected for a while as Revere looked through the Company forms.
13704,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13705,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Does Dormer do anything, Sergeant?"" Bobby asked, with the air of one"
13706,ONLY A SUBALTERN,continuing an interrupted conversation.
13707,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13708,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""No, sir. Does 'is dooty like a hortomato,"" said the Sergeant, who"
13709,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"delighted in long words. ""A dirty soldier, and 'e's under full stoppages"

13722,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Revere signed the last paper and the Sergeant retreated.
13723,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13724,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""It's a filthy amusement,"" sighed Bobby to himself. Then aloud to"
13725,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Revere: ""Are you really worried about Dormer?"""
13726,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13727,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""A little. You see he's never mad enough to send to a hospital, or"
13728,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"drunk enough to run in, but at any minute he may flare up, brooding and"
13729,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"sulking as he does. He resents any interest being shown in him, and the"
13730,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"only time I took him out shooting he all but shot me by accident."""
13731,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13732,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""I fish,"" said Bobby, with a wry face. ""I hire a country-boat and go"
13733,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"down the river from Thursday to Sunday, and the amiable Dormer goes with"

13735,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13736,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""You blazing young fool!"" said Revere, but his heart was full of much"
13737,ONLY A SUBALTERN,more pleasant words.
13738,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13739,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Bobby, the Captain of a dhoni, with Private Dormer for mate, dropped"
13740,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"down the river on Thursday morning--the Private at the bow, the"
13741,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Subaltern at the helm. The Private glared uneasily at the Subaltern, who"
13742,ONLY A SUBALTERN,respected the reserve of the Private.
13743,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13744,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"After six hours, Dormer paced to the stern, saluted, and said--""Beg"
13745,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"y'pardon, sir, but was you ever on the Durh'm Canal?"""
13746,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13747,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""No,"" said Bobby Wick. ""Come and have some tiffin."""
13748,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13749,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"They ate in silence. As the evening fell, Private Dormer broke forth,"
13750,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"speaking to himself--""Hi was on the Durh'm Canal, jes' such a night,"
13751,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"come next week twelve month, a-trailin' of my toes in the water."" He"
13752,ONLY A SUBALTERN,smoked and said no more till bedtime.
13753,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13754,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"The witchery of the dawn turned the grey river-reaches to purple, gold,"
13755,ONLY A SUBALTERN,and opal; and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the
13756,ONLY A SUBALTERN,splendors of a new heaven.
13757,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13758,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Private Dormer popped his head out of his blanket and gazed at the glory
13759,ONLY A SUBALTERN,below and around.
13760,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13761,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Well--damn-my-eyes!"" said Private Dormer, in an awed whisper. ""This"
13762,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"'ere is like a bloomin' gallantry-show!"" For the rest of the day he was"
13763,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"dumb, but achieved an ensanguined filthiness through the cleaning of big"
13764,ONLY A SUBALTERN,fish.
13765,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13766,ONLY A SUBALTERN,The boat returned on Saturday evening. Dormer had been struggling with
13767,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"speech since noon. As the lines and luggage were being disembarked, he"
13768,ONLY A SUBALTERN,found tongue.
13769,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13770,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Beg y'pardon--sir,"" he said, ""but would you--would you min' shakin'"
13771,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"'ands with me, sir?"""
13772,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13773,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Of course not,"" said Bobby, and he shook accordingly. Dormer returned"
13774,ONLY A SUBALTERN,to barracks and Bobby to mess.
13775,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13776,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""He wanted a little quiet and some fishing, I think,"" said Bobby. ""My"

13782,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13783,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"When the spring died, Bobby joined in the general scramble for Hill"

13800,ONLY A SUBALTERN,new white cord breeches on the strength of it.
13801,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13802,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""We're in a bad way,"" wrote Revere to Bobby at the end of two months."
13803,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Since you left, the Regiment has taken to fever and is fairly rotten"

13806,ONLY A SUBALTERN,outside. There's rather more sickness in the out-villages than I care
13807,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"for, but then I'm so blistered with prickly-heat that I'm ready to hang"

13809,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"serious, I hope? You're over-young to hang millstones round your neck,"
13810,ONLY A SUBALTERN,and the Colonel will turf you out of that in double-quick time if you
13811,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"attempt it."""
13812,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13813,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"It was not the Colonel that brought Bobby out of Simla, but a much more"
13814,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"to be respected Commandant. The sick ness in the out-villages spread,"
13815,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Bazar was put out of bounds, and then came the news that the"
13816,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Tail Twisters must go into camp. The message flashed to the Hill
13817,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"stations.--""Cholera--Leave stopped--Officers recalled."" Alas, for the"
13818,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"white gloves in the neatly soldered boxes, the rides and the dances and"
13819,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"picnics that were to he, the loves half spoken, and the debts unpaid!"
13820,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Without demur and without question, fast as tongue could fly or pony"
13821,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"gallop, back to their Regiments and their Batteries, as though they were"
13822,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"hastening to their weddings, fled the subalterns."
13823,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13824,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Bobby received his orders on returning from a dance at Viceregal Lodge
13825,ONLY A SUBALTERN,where he had--but only the Haverley girl knows what Bobby had said or
13826,ONLY A SUBALTERN,how many waltzes he had claimed for the next ball. Six in the morning
13827,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"saw Bobby at the Tonga Office in the drenching rain, the whirl of the"
13828,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"last waltz still in his ears, and an intoxication due neither to wine"
13829,ONLY A SUBALTERN,nor waltzing in his brain.
13830,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13831,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Good man!"" shouted Deighton of the Horse Battery, through the mists."
13832,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Whar you raise dat tonga? I'm coming with you. Ow! But I've had a head"

13838,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""My faith! It'll be more bally corpse than bride, though, this journey. Jump"
13839,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"in, Bobby. Get on, Coachman!"""
13840,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13841,ONLY A SUBALTERN,On the Umballa platform waited a detachment of officers discussing the
13842,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"latest news from the stricken cantonment, and it was here that Bobby"
13843,ONLY A SUBALTERN,learned the real condition of the Tail Twisters.
13844,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13845,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""They went into camp,"" said an elderly Major recalled from the"
13846,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"whist-tables at Mussoorie to a sickly Native Regiment, ""they went into"
13847,ONLY A SUBALTERN,camp with two hundred and ten sick in carts. Two hundred and ten fever
13848,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"cases only, and the balance looking like so many ghosts with sore eyes."
13849,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"A Madras Regiment could have walked through 'em."""
13850,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13851,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""But they were as fit as be-damned when I left them!"" said Bobby."
13852,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13853,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Then you'd better make them as fit as be-damned when you rejoin,"" said"
13854,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Major, brutally."
13855,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13856,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Bobby pressed his forehead against the rain-splashed windowpane as the
13857,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"train lumbered across the sodden Doab, and prayed for the health of the"
13858,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Tyneside Tail Twisters. Naini Tal had sent down her contingent with
13859,ONLY A SUBALTERN,all speed; the lathering ponies of the Dalhousie Road staggered into
13860,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Pathankot, taxed to the full stretch of their strength; while from"
13861,ONLY A SUBALTERN,cloudy Darjiling the Calcutta Mail whirled up the last straggler of the
13862,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"little army that was to fight a fight, in which was neither medal nor"
13863,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"honor for the winning, against an enemy none other than ""the sickness"
13864,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"that destroyeth in the noonday."""
13865,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13866,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"And as each man reported himself, he said: ""This is a bad business,"""
13867,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"and went about his own forthwith, for every Regiment and Battery in the"
13868,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"cantonment was under canvas, the sickness bearing them company."
13869,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13870,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Bobby fought his way through the rain to the Tail Twisters' temporary
13871,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"mess, and Revere could have fallen on the boy's neck for the joy of"
13872,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"seeing that ugly, wholesome phiz once more."
13873,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13874,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Keep 'em amused and interested,"" said Revere. ""They went on the drink,"
13875,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"poor fools, after the first two cases, and there was no improvement. Oh,"
13876,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"it's good to have you back, Bobby! Porkiss is a--never mind."""
13877,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13878,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Deighton came over from the Artillery camp to attend a dreary mess
13879,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"dinner, and contributed to the general gloom by nearly weeping over the"
13880,ONLY A SUBALTERN,condition of his beloved Battery. Porkiss so far forgot himself as to
13881,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"insinuate that the presence of the officers could do no earthly good,"
13882,ONLY A SUBALTERN,and that the best thing would be to send the entire Regiment into
13883,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"hospital and ""let the doctors look after them."" Porkiss was demoralized"
13884,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"with fear, nor was his peace of mind restored when Revere said coldly:"
13885,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Oh! The sooner you go out the better, if that's your way of thinking."
13886,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Any public school could send us fifty good men in your place, but it"
13887,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"takes time, time, Porkiss, and money, and a certain amount of trouble,"
13888,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"to make a Regiment. 'S'pose you're the person we go into camp for, eh?"""
13889,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13890,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Whereupon Porkiss was overtaken with a great and chilly fear which a
13891,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"drenching in the rain did not allay, and, two days later, quitted this"
13892,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"world for another where, men do fondly hope, allowances are made for the"
13893,ONLY A SUBALTERN,weaknesses of the flesh. The Regimental Sergeant-Major looked wearily
13894,ONLY A SUBALTERN,across the Sergeants' Mess tent when the news was announced.
13895,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13896,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""There goes the worst of them,"" he said. ""It'll take the best, and then,"
13897,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"please God, it'll stop."" The Sergeants were silent till one said: ""It"
13898,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"couldn't be him!"" and all knew of whom Travis was thinking."
13899,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13900,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Bobby Wick stormed through the tents of his Company, rallying,"
13901,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"rebuking mildly, as is consistent with the Regulations, chaffing the"
13902,ONLY A SUBALTERN,faint-hearted: haling the sound into the watery sunlight when there
13903,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"was a break in the weather, and bidding them be of good cheer for"
13904,ONLY A SUBALTERN,their trouble was nearly at an end; scuttling on his dun pony round
13905,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the outskirts of the camp and heading back men who, with the innate"
13906,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"perversity of British soldier's, were always wandering into infected"
13907,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"villages, or drinking deeply from rain-flooded marshes; comforting the"
13908,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"panic-stricken with rude speech, and more than once tending the dying"
13909,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"who had no friends--the men without ""townies""; organizing, with banjos"
13910,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"and burned cork, Sing-songs which should allow the talent of the"
13911,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Regiment full play; and generally, as he explained, ""playing the giddy"
13912,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"garden-goat all round."""
13913,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13914,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""You're worth half a dozen of us, Bobby,"" said Revere in a moment of"
13915,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"enthusiasm. ""How the devil do you keep it up?"""
13916,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13917,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Bobby made no answer, but had Revere looked into the breast-pocket of"
13918,ONLY A SUBALTERN,his coat he might have seen there a sheaf of badly-written letters which
13919,ONLY A SUBALTERN,perhaps accounted for the power that possessed the boy. A letter came
13920,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"to Bobby every other day. The spelling was not above reproach, but the"
13921,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"sentiments must have been most satisfactory, for on receipt Bobby's eyes"
13922,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"softened marvelously, and he was wont to fall into a tender abstraction"
13923,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"for a while ere, shaking his cropped head, he charged into his work."
13924,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13925,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"By what power he drew after him the hearts of the roughest, and the"
13926,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Tail Twisters counted in their ranks some rough diamonds indeed, was"
13927,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"a mystery to both skipper and C. O., who learned from the regimental"
13928,ONLY A SUBALTERN,chaplain that Bobby was considerably more in request in the hospital
13929,ONLY A SUBALTERN,tents than the Reverend John Emery.
13930,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13931,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""The men seem fond of you. Are you in the hospitals much?"" said the"
13932,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Colonel, who did his daily round and ordered the men to get well with a"
13933,ONLY A SUBALTERN,hardness that did not cover his bitter grief.
13934,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13935,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""A little, sir,"" said Bobby."
13936,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13937,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Shouldn't go there too often if I were you. They say it's not"
13938,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"contagious, but there's no use in running unnecessary risks. We can't"
13939,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"afford to have you down, y'know."""
13940,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13941,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Six days later, it was with the utmost difficulty that the post-runner"
13942,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"plashed his way out to the camp with mailbags, for the rain was falling"
13943,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"in torrents. Bobby received a letter, bore it off to his tent, and, the"
13944,ONLY A SUBALTERN,programme for the next week's Sing-song being satisfactorily disposed
13945,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"of, sat down to answer it. For an hour the unhandy pen toiled over the"
13946,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"paper, and where sentiment rose to more than normal tide-level Bobby"
13947,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Wick stuck out his tongue and breathed heavily. He was not used to
13948,ONLY A SUBALTERN,letter-writing.
13949,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13950,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Beg y'pardon, sir,"" said a voice at the tent door; ""but Dormer's 'orrid"
13951,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"bad, sir, an' they've taken him orf, sir."
13952,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13953,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Damn Private Dormer and you too!"" said Bobby Wick running the blotter"
13954,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"over the half-finished letter. ""Tell him I'll come in the morning."""
13955,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13956,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""'E's awful bad, sir,"" said the voice, hesitatingly. There was an"
13957,ONLY A SUBALTERN,undecided squelching of heavy boots.
13958,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13959,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Well?"" said Bobby, impatiently."
13960,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13961,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Excusin' 'imself before an' for takin' the liberty, 'e says it would be"
13962,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"a comfort for to assist 'im, sir, if""--"
13963,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13964,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Tattoo lao! Get my pony! Here, come in out of the rain till I'm ready."

13968,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Strengthened by a four-finger ""nip"" which he swallowed without a wink,"
13969,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the Hospital Orderly kept up with the slipping, mud-stained, and very"
13970,ONLY A SUBALTERN,disgusted pony as it shambled to the hospital tent.
13971,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13972,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Private Dormer was certainly ""'orrid bad."" He had all but reached the"
13973,ONLY A SUBALTERN,stage of collapse and was not pleasant to look upon.
13974,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13975,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""What's this, Dormer?"" said Bobby, bending over the man. ""You're not"
13976,ONLY A SUBALTERN,going out this time. You've got to come fishin' with me once or twice
13977,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"more yet."""
13978,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13979,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"The blue lips parted and in the ghost of a whisper said,--""Beg y'pardon,"
13980,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"sir, disturbin' of you now, but would you min' 'oldin' my 'and, sir?"""
13981,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13982,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Bobby sat on the side of the bed, and the icy cold hand closed on his"
13983,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"own like a vice, forcing a lady's ring which was on the little finger"
13984,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"deep into the flesh. Bobby set his lips and waited, the water dripping"
13985,ONLY A SUBALTERN,from the hem of his trousers. An hour passed and the grasp of the hand
13986,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"did not relax, nor did the expression on the drawn face change. Bobby"
13987,ONLY A SUBALTERN,with infinite craft lit himself a cheroot with the left hand--his right
13988,ONLY A SUBALTERN,arm was numbed to the elbow--and resigned himself to a night of pain.
13989,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13990,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Dawn showed a very white-faced Subaltern sitting on the side of a
13991,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"sick man's cot, and a Doctor in the doorway using language unfit for"
13992,ONLY A SUBALTERN,publication.
13993,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13994,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Have you been here all night, you young ass?"" said the Doctor."
13995,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13996,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""There or thereabouts,"" said Bobby, ruefully. ""He's frozen on to me."""
13997,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
13998,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Dormer's mouth shut with a click. He turned his head and sighed. The
13999,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"clinging band opened, and Bobby's arm fell useless at his side."
14000,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14001,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""He'll do,"" said the Doctor, quietly. ""It must have been a toss-up all"
14002,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"through the night. 'Think you're to be congratulated on this case."""
14003,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14004,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Oh, bosh!"" said Bobby. ""I thought the man had gone out long"
14005,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"ago--only--only I didn't care to take my hand away. Rub my arm down,"
14006,ONLY A SUBALTERN,there's a good chap. What a grip the brute has! I'm chilled to the
14007,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"marrow!"" He passed out of the tent shivering."
14008,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14009,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Private Dormer was allowed to celebrate his repulse of Death by strong
14010,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"waters. Four days later, he sat on the side of his cot and said to the"
14011,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"patients mildly: ""I'd 'a' liken to 'a' spoken to 'im--so I should."""
14012,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14013,ONLY A SUBALTERN,But at that time Bobby was reading yet another letter--he had the most
14014,ONLY A SUBALTERN,persistent correspondent of any man in camp--and was even then about to
14015,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"write that the sickness had abated, and in another week at the outside"
14016,ONLY A SUBALTERN,would be gone. He did not intend to say that the chill of a sick man's
14017,ONLY A SUBALTERN,hand seemed to have struck into the heart whose capacities for affection
14018,ONLY A SUBALTERN,he dwelt on at such length. He did intend to enclose the illustrated
14019,ONLY A SUBALTERN,programme of the forthcoming Sing-song whereof he was not a little
14020,ONLY A SUBALTERN,proud. He also intended to write on many other matters which do not
14021,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"concern us, and doubtless would have done so but for the slight feverish"
14022,ONLY A SUBALTERN,headache which made him dull and unresponsive at mess.
14023,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14024,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""You are overdoing it, Bobby,"" said his skipper. ""'Might give the rest"
14025,ONLY A SUBALTERN,of us credit of doing a little work. You go on as if you were the whole
14026,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Mess rolled into one. Take it easy."""
14027,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14028,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""I will,"" said Bobby. ""I'm feeling done up, somehow."" Revere looked at"
14029,ONLY A SUBALTERN,him anxiously and said nothing.
14030,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14031,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"There was a flickering of lanterns about the camp that night, and a"
14032,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"rumor that brought men out of their cots to the tent doors, a paddling"
14033,ONLY A SUBALTERN,of the naked feet of doolie-bearers and the rush of a galloping horse.
14034,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14035,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Wot's up?"" asked twenty tents; and through twenty tents ran the"
14036,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"answer--""Wick, 'e's down."""
14037,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14038,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"They brought the news to Revere and he groaned. ""Any one but Bobby and I"
14039,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"shouldn't have cared! The Sergeant-Major was right."""
14040,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14041,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Not going out this journey,"" gasped Bobby, as he was lifted from"
14042,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"the doolie. ""Not going out this journey."" Then with an air of supreme"
14043,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"conviction--""I can't, you see."""
14044,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14045,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Not if I can do anything!"" said the Surgeon-Major, who had hastened"
14046,ONLY A SUBALTERN,over from the mess where he had been dining.
14047,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14048,ONLY A SUBALTERN,He and the Regimental Surgeon fought together with Death for the life
14049,ONLY A SUBALTERN,of Bobby Wick. Their work was interrupted by a hairy apparition in a
14050,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"blue-grey dressing-gown who stared in horror at the bed and cried--""Oh,"
14051,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"my Gawd. It can't be 'im!"" until an indignant Hospital Orderly whisked"
14052,ONLY A SUBALTERN,him away.
14053,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14054,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"If care of man and desire to live could have done aught, Bobby would"
14055,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"have been saved. As it was, he made a fight of three days, and the"
14056,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Surgeon-Major's brow uncreased. ""We'll save him yet,"" he said; and the"
14057,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Surgeon, who, though he ranked with the Captain, had a very youthful"
14058,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"heart, went out upon the word and pranced joyously in the mud."
14059,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14060,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Not going out this journey,"" whispered Bobby Wick, gallantly, at the"
14061,ONLY A SUBALTERN,end of the third day.
14062,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14063,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Bravo!"" said the Surgeon-Major. ""That's the way to look at it, Bobby."""
14064,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14065,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"As evening fell a grey shade gathered round Bobby's mouth, and he turned"
14066,ONLY A SUBALTERN,his face to the tent wall wearily. The Surgeon-Major frowned.
14067,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14068,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""I'm awfully tired,"" said Bobby, very faintly. ""What's the use of"
14069,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"bothering me with medicine? I-don't-want-it. Let me alone."""
14070,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14071,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"The desire for life had departed, and Bobby was content to drift away on"
14072,ONLY A SUBALTERN,the easy tide of Death.
14073,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14074,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""It's no good,"" said the Surgeon-Major. ""He doesn't want to live. He's"
14075,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"meeting it, poor child."" And he blew his nose."
14076,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14077,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Half a mile away, the regimental band was playing the overture to the"
14078,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Sing-song, for the men had been told that Bobby was out of danger. The"
14079,ONLY A SUBALTERN,clash of the brass and the wail of the horns reached Bobby's ears.
14080,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14081,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Is there a single joy or pain,"
14082,ONLY A SUBALTERN,That I should never kno-ow?
14083,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"You do not love me, 'tis in vain,"
14084,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Bid me goodbye and go!
14085,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14086,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"An expression of hopeless irritation crossed the boy's face, and he"

14088,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14089,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"The Surgeon-Major bent down--""What is it? Bobby?""--"
14090,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14091,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"""Not that waltz,"" muttered Bobby. ""That's our own--our very ownest own."
14092,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Mummy dear."""
14093,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14094,ONLY A SUBALTERN,With this he sank into the stupor that gave place to death early next
14095,ONLY A SUBALTERN,morning.
14096,ONLY A SUBALTERN,
14097,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"Revere, his eyes red at the rims and his nose very white, went into"
14098,ONLY A SUBALTERN,Bobby's tent to write a letter to Papa Wick which should bow the white
14099,ONLY A SUBALTERN,head of the ex-Commissioner of Chota-Buldana in the keenest sorrow of
14100,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"his life. Bobby's little store of papers lay in confusion on the table,"
14101,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"and among them a half-finished letter. The last sentence ran: ""So you"

14103,ONLY A SUBALTERN,"care for me and I care for you, nothing can touch me."""
14104,ONLY A SUBALTERN,

14173,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14174,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,That is the prologue. This is the story:
14175,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14176,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Corporal Slane was engaged to be married to Miss Jhansi M'Kenna,"
14177,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,whose history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere. He had his
14178,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Colonel's permission, and, being popular with the men, every arrangement"
14179,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"had been made to give the wedding what Private Ortheris called ""eeklar."""
14180,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"It fell in the heart of the hot weather, and, after the wedding,"
14181,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Slane was going up to the Hills with the Bride. None the less, Slane's"
14182,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"grievance was that the affair would Be only a hired-carriage wedding,"
14183,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"and he felt that the ""eeklar"" of that was meagre. Miss M'Kenna did"
14184,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,not care so much. The Sergeant's wife was helping her to make her
14185,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"wedding-dress, and she was very busy. Slane was, just then, the only"
14186,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,moderately contented man in barracks. All the rest were more or less
14187,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,miserable.
14188,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14189,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"And they had so much to make them happy, too. All their work was over"
14190,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"at eight in the morning, and for the rest of the day they could lie on"
14191,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,their backs and smoke Canteen-plug and swear at the punkah-coolies. They
14192,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"enjoyed a fine, full flesh meal in the middle of the day, and then threw"
14193,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool
14194,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"enough to go out with their ""towny,"" whose vocabulary contained less"
14195,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"than six hundred words, and the Adjective, and whose views on every"
14196,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,conceivable question they had heard many times before.
14197,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14198,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"There was the Canteen, of course, and there was the Temperance Room with"
14199,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,the second-hand papers in it; but a man of any profession cannot read
14200,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in
14201,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"the shade, running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight. Very few"
14202,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"men, even though they get a pannikin of flat, stale, muddy beer and hide"
14203,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"it under their cots, can continue drinking for six hours a day. One man"
14204,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"tried, but he died, and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral"
14205,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,because it gave them something to do. It was too early for the
14206,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,excitement of fever or cholera. The men could only wait and wait and
14207,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"wait, and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding"
14208,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,white dust. That was a gay life.
14209,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14210,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"They lounged about cantonments--it was too hot for any sort of game,"
14211,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"and almost too hot for vice--and fuddled themselves in the evening,"
14212,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food
14213,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"provided for them, and the more they stoked the less exercise they took"
14214,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"and more explosive they grew. Then tempers began to wear away, and men"
14215,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"fell a-brooding over insults real or imaginary, for they had nothing"
14216,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"else to think of. The tone of the repartees changed, and instead of"
14217,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"saying light-heartedly: ""I'll knock your silly face in,"" men grew"
14218,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,laboriously polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough
14219,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"for themselves and their enemy, and that there would be more space for"
14220,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,one of the two in another place.
14221,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14222,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"It may have been the Devil who arranged the thing, but the fact of the"
14223,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,case is that Losson had for a long time been worrying Simmons in an
14224,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,aimless way. It gave him occupation. The two had their cots side by
14225,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"side, and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other;"
14226,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,but Simmons was afraid of Losson and dared not challenge him to a fight.
14227,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"He thought over the words in the hot still nights, and half the hate he"
14228,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,felt toward Losson be vented on the wretched punkah-coolie.
14229,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14230,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Losson bought a parrot in the bazar, and put it into a little cage,"
14231,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"and lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well, and sat on the"
14232,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"well-curb, shouting bad language down to the parrot. He taught it to"
14233,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"say: ""Simmons, ye so-oor,"" which means swine, and several other things"
14234,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"entirely unfit for publication. He was a big gross man, and he shook"
14235,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"like a jelly when the parrot had the sentence correctly. Simmons,"
14236,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"however, shook with rage, for all the room were laughing at him--the"
14237,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,parrot was such a disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so
14238,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"human when it chattered. Losson used to sit, swinging his fat legs, on"
14239,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"the side of the cot, and ask the parrot what it thought of Simmons. The"
14240,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"parrot would answer: ""Simmons, ye so-oor."" ""Good boy,"" Losson used to"
14241,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"say, scratching the parrot's head; ""ye 'ear that, Sim?"""
14242,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14243,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"And Simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer: ""I 'ear."
14244,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Take 'eed you don't 'ear something one of these days."""
14245,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14246,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"In the restless nights, after he had been asleep all day, fits of blind"
14247,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"rage came upon Simmons and held him till he trembled all over, while he"
14248,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,thought in how many different ways he would slay Losson. Sometimes he
14249,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"would picture himself trampling the life out of the man, with heavy"
14250,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"ammunition-boots, and at others smashing in his face with the butt, and"
14251,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the
14252,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"neckbone cracked. Then his mouth would feel hot and fevered, and he"
14253,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,would reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin.
14254,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14255,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,But the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him
14256,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,longest was one connected with the great roll of fat under Losson's
14257,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"right ear. He noticed it first on a moonlight night, and thereafter"
14258,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,it was always before his eyes. It was a fascinating roll of fat. A man
14259,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,could get his hand upon it and tear away one side of the neck; or he
14260,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in
14261,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"a flash. Losson had no right to be sleek and contented and well-to-do,"
14262,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"when he, Simmons, was the butt of the room, Some day, perhaps, he would"
14263,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"show those who laughed at the ""Simmons, ye so-oor"" joke, that he was as"
14264,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"good as the rest, and held a man's life in the crook of his forefinger."
14265,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"When Losson snored, Simmons hated him more bitterly than ever. Why"
14266,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,should Losson be able to sleep when Simmons had to stay awake hour after
14267,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"hour, tossing and turning on the tapes, with the dull liver pain gnawing"
14268,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after Canteen? He
14269,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"thought over this for many nights, and the world became unprofitable to"
14270,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,him. He even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco;
14271,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him.
14272,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14273,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,The heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before.
14274,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"A Sergeant's wife died of heat-apoplexy in the night, and the rumor ran"
14275,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"abroad that it was cholera. Men rejoiced openly, hoping that it would"
14276,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,spread and send them into camp. But that was a false alarm.
14277,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14278,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"It was late on a Tuesday evening, and the men were waiting in the deep"
14279,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"double verandas for ""Last Posts,"" when Simmons went to the box at the"
14280,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"foot of his bed, took out his pipe, and slammed the lid down with a"
14281,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,bang that echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle.
14282,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Ordinarily speaking, the men would have taken no notice; but their"
14283,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"nerves were fretted to fiddle-strings. They jumped up, and three or four"
14284,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,clattered into the barrack-room only to find Simmons kneeling by his
14285,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,box.
14286,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14287,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Owl It's you, is it?"" they said and laughed foolishly. ""We t h o u g"
14288,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"h t 'twas""--Simmons rose slowly. If the accident had so shaken his"
14289,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"fellows, what would not the reality do?"
14290,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14291,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""You thought it was--did you? And what makes you think?"" he said,"
14292,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"lashing himself into madness as he went on; ""to Hell with your thinking,"
14293,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"ye dirty spies."""
14294,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14295,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Simmons, ye so-oor,"" chuckled the parrot in the veranda, sleepily,"
14296,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,recognizing a well-known voice. Now that was absolutely all.
14297,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14298,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,The tension snapped. Simmons fell back on the arm-rack
14299,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"deliberately,--the men were at the far end of the room,--and took out"
14300,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"his rifle and packet of ammunition. ""Don't go playing the goat, Sim!"""
14301,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"said Losson. ""Put it down,"" but there was a quaver in his voice. Another"
14302,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"man stooped, slipped his boot and hurled it at Simmons's head. The"
14303,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"prompt answer was a shot which, fired at random, found its billet in"
14304,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Losson's throat. Losson fell forward without a word, and the others"
14305,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,scattered.
14306,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14307,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""You thought it was!"" yelled Simmons. ""You're drivin' me to it! I tell"
14308,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"you you're drivin' me to it! Get up, Losson, an' don't lie shammin'"
14309,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"there--you an' your blasted parrit that druv me to it!"""
14310,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14311,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,But there was an unaffected reality about Losson's pose that showed
14312,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,Simmons what he had done. The men were still clamoring on the veranda.
14313,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,Simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the
14314,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"moonlight, muttering: ""I'll make a night of it. Thirty roun's, an' the"
14315,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"last for myself. Take you that, you dogs!"""
14316,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14317,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,He dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the
14318,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"veranda, but the bullet flew high, and landed in the brickwork with a"
14319,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"vicious phat that made some of the younger ones turn pale. It is, as"
14320,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"musketry theorists observe, one thing to fire and another to be fired"
14321,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,at.
14322,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14323,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,Then the instinct of the chase flared up. The news spread from barrack
14324,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"to barrack, and the men doubled out intent on the capture of Simmons,"
14325,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"the wild beast, who was heading for the Cavalry parade-ground, stopping"
14326,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,now and again to send back a shot and a curse in the direction of his
14327,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,pursuers.
14328,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14329,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""I'll learn you to spy on me!"" he shouted; ""I'll learn you to give me"
14330,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"dorg's names! Come on the 'ole lot o' you! Colonel John Anthony Deever,"
14331,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"C.B.!""--he turned toward the Infantry Mess and shook his rifle--""you"

14335,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,out and see me practiss on the rainge. I'm the crack shot of the 'ole
14336,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"bloomin' battalion."" In proof of which statement Simmons fired at the"
14337,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,lighted windows of the mess-house.
14338,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14339,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Private Simmons, E Comp'ny, on the Cavalry p'rade-ground, Sir, with"
14340,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"thirty rounds,"" said a Sergeant breathlessly to the Colonel. ""Shootin'"
14341,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"right and lef', Sir. Shot Private Losson. What's to be done, Sir?"""
14342,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14343,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Colonel John Anthony Deever, C.B., sallied out, only to be saluted by s"
14344,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,spurt of dust at his feet.
14345,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14346,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Pull up!"" said the Second in Command; ""I don't want my step in that"
14347,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"way, Colonel. He's as dangerous as a mad dog."""
14348,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14349,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Shoot him like one, then,"" said the Colonel, bitterly, ""if he won't"
14350,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"take his chance, My regiment, too! If it had been the Towheads I could"
14351,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"have under stood."""
14352,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14353,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,Private Simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge
14354,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"of the parade-ground, and was defying the regiment to come on. The"
14355,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"regiment was not anxious to comply, for there is small honor in being"
14356,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"shot by a fellow-private. Only Corporal Slane, rifle in band, threw"
14357,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"himself down on the ground, and wormed his way toward the well."
14358,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14359,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Don't shoot,"" said he to the men round him; ""like as not you'll hit me."
14360,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"I'll catch the beggar, livin'."""
14361,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14362,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Simmons ceased shouting for a while, and the noise of trap-wheels could"
14363,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"be heard across the plain. Major Oldyn, commanding the Horse Battery,"
14364,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,was coming back from a dinner in the Civil Lines; was driving after his
14365,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"usual custom--that is to say, as fast as the horse could go."
14366,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14367,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""A orf'cer! A blooming spangled orf'cer,"" shrieked Simmons; ""I'll make a"
14368,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"scarecrow of that orf'cer!"" The trap stopped."
14369,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14370,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""What's this?"" demanded the Major of Gunners. ""You there, drop your"
14371,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"rifle."""
14372,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14373,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Why, it's Jerry Blazes! I ain't got no quarrel with you, Jerry Blazes."
14374,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Pass frien', an' all's well!"""
14375,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14376,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,But Jerry Blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous
14377,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"murderer. He was, as his adoring Battery swore long and fervently,"
14378,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"without knowledge of fear, and they were surely the best judges, for"
14379,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Jerry Blazes, it was notorious, had done his possible to kill a man each"
14380,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,time the Battery went out.
14381,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14382,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"He walked toward Simmons, with the intention of rushing him, and"
14383,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,knocking him down.
14384,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14385,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"""Don't make me do it, Sir,"" said Simmons; ""I ain't got nothing agin you."
14386,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"Ah! you would?""--the Major broke into a run--""Take that then!"""
14387,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,
14388,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"The Major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder, and Simmons stood"

14433,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"knew something of Simmons's weakness, and knew, too, the deadly guard"

14436,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,"knee-cap, he met the blow standing on one leg--exactly as Gonds stand"
14437,IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE,when they meditate--and ready for the fall that would follow. There was

15666,LISPETH,"missionaries, but before Kotgarh had quite forgotten her title of"
15667,LISPETH,"""Mistress of the Northern Hills."""
15668,LISPETH,
15669,LISPETH,"Whether Christianity improved Lispeth, or whether the gods of her own"
15670,LISPETH,"people would have done as much for her under any circumstances, I do not"
15671,LISPETH,"know; but she grew very lovely. When a Hill girl grows lovely, she is"
15672,LISPETH,worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon. Lispeth had a
15673,LISPETH,"Greek face--one of those faces people paint so often, and see so seldom."
15674,LISPETH,"She was of a pale, ivory color and, for her race, extremely tall. Also,"
15675,LISPETH,"she possessed eyes that were wonderful; and, had she not been dressed in"
15676,LISPETH,"the abominable print-cloths affected by Missions, you would, meeting her"
15677,LISPETH,"on the hill-side unexpectedly, have thought her the original Diana of"
15678,LISPETH,the Romans going out to slay.
15679,LISPETH,
15680,LISPETH,"Lispeth took to Christianity readily, and did not abandon it when she"
15681,LISPETH,"reached womanhood, as do some Hill girls. Her own people hated her"
15682,LISPETH,"because she had, they said, become a memsahib and washed herself daily;"
15683,LISPETH,"and the Chaplain's wife did not know what to do with her. Somehow,"
15684,LISPETH,"one cannot ask a stately goddess, five foot ten in her shoes, to clean"
15685,LISPETH,plates and dishes. So she played with the Chaplain's children and took
15686,LISPETH,"classes in the Sunday School, and read all the books in the house, and"
15687,LISPETH,"grew more and more beautiful, like the Princesses in fairy tales. The"
15688,LISPETH,Chaplain's wife said that the girl ought to take service in Simla as a
15689,LISPETH,"nurse or something ""genteel."" But Lispeth did not want to take service."
15690,LISPETH,She was very happy where she was.
15691,LISPETH,
15692,LISPETH,"When travellers--there were not many in those years--came to Kotgarh,"
15693,LISPETH,Lispeth used to lock herself into her own room for fear they might take
15694,LISPETH,"her away to Simla, or somewhere out into the unknown world."
15695,LISPETH,
15696,LISPETH,"One day, a few months after she was seventeen years old, Lispeth went"
15697,LISPETH,out for a walk. She did not walk in the manner of English ladies--a mile
15698,LISPETH,"and a half out, and a ride back again. She covered between twenty and"
15699,LISPETH,"thirty miles in her little constitutionals, all about and about, between"
15700,LISPETH,"Kotgarh and Narkunda. This time she came back at full dusk, stepping"
15701,LISPETH,down the breakneck descent into Kotgarh with something heavy in her
15702,LISPETH,arms. The Chaplain's wife was dozing in the drawing-room when Lispeth
15703,LISPETH,came in breathing hard and very exhausted with her burden. Lispeth put
15704,LISPETH,"it down on the sofa, and said simply:"
15705,LISPETH,
15706,LISPETH,"""This is my husband. I found him on the Bagi Road. He has hurt himself."
15707,LISPETH,"We will nurse him, and when he is well, your husband shall marry him to"
15708,LISPETH,"me."""
15709,LISPETH,
15710,LISPETH,This was the first mention Lispeth had ever made of her matrimonial
15711,LISPETH,"views, and the Chaplain's wife shrieked with horror. However, the man on"
15712,LISPETH,"the sofa needed attention first. He was a young Englishman, and his head"
15713,LISPETH,had been cut to the bone by something jagged. Lispeth said she had found
15714,LISPETH,"him down the khud, so she had brought him in."
15715,LISPETH,
15716,LISPETH,He was breathing queerly and was unconscious.
15717,LISPETH,
15718,LISPETH,"He was put to bed and tended by the Chaplain, who knew something of"
15719,LISPETH,medicine; and Lispeth waited outside the door in case she could be
15720,LISPETH,useful. She explained to the Chaplain that this was the man she meant
15721,LISPETH,to marry; and the Chaplain and his wife lectured her severely on the
15722,LISPETH,"impropriety of her conduct. Lispeth listened quietly, and repeated her"
15723,LISPETH,first proposition. It takes a great deal of Christianity to wipe out
15724,LISPETH,"uncivilized Eastern instincts, such as falling in love at first sight."
15725,LISPETH,"Lispeth, having found the man she worshipped, did not see why she should"
15726,LISPETH,"keep silent as to her choice. She had no intention of being sent away,"
15727,LISPETH,either. She was going to nurse that Englishman until he was well enough
15728,LISPETH,to marry her. This was her little programme.
15729,LISPETH,
15730,LISPETH,"After a fortnight of slight fever and inflammation, the Englishman"
15731,LISPETH,"recovered coherence and thanked the Chaplain and his wife, and"
15732,LISPETH,Lispeth--especially Lispeth--for their kindness. He was a traveller in
15733,LISPETH,"the East, he said--they never talked about ""globe-trotters"" in those"
15734,LISPETH,"days, when the P. & O. fleet was young and small--and had come from"
15735,LISPETH,Dehra Dun to hunt for plants and butterflies among the Simla hills. No
15736,LISPETH,"one at Simla, therefore, knew anything about him. He fancied he must"
15737,LISPETH,"have fallen over the cliff while stalking a fern on a rotten tree-trunk,"
15738,LISPETH,and that his coolies must have stolen his baggage and fled. He thought
15739,LISPETH,he would go back to Simla when he was a little stronger. He desired no
15740,LISPETH,more mountaineering.
15741,LISPETH,
15742,LISPETH,"He made small haste to go away, and recovered his strength slowly."
15743,LISPETH,
15744,LISPETH,Lispeth objected to being advised either by the Chaplain or his wife;
15745,LISPETH,"so the latter spoke to the Englishman, and told him how matters stood in"
15746,LISPETH,"Lispeth's heart. He laughed a good deal, and said it was very pretty and"
15747,LISPETH,"romantic, a perfect idyl of the Himalayas; but, as he was engaged to a"
15748,LISPETH,"girl at Home, he fancied that nothing would happen. Certainly he would"
15749,LISPETH,behave with discretion. He did that. Still he found it very pleasant to
15750,LISPETH,"talk to Lispeth, and walk with Lispeth, and say nice things to her, and"
15751,LISPETH,call her pet names while he was getting strong enough to go away. It
15752,LISPETH,"meant nothing at all to him, and everything in the world to Lispeth. She"
15753,LISPETH,"was very happy while the fortnight lasted, because she had found a man"
15754,LISPETH,to love.
15755,LISPETH,
15756,LISPETH,"Being a savage by birth, she took no trouble to hide her feelings, and"
15757,LISPETH,"the Englishman was amused. When he went away, Lispeth walked with him,"
15758,LISPETH,"up the Hill as far as Narkunda, very troubled and very miserable. The"
15759,LISPETH,"Chaplain's wife, being a good Christian and disliking anything in"
15760,LISPETH,the shape of fuss or scandal--Lispeth was beyond her management
15761,LISPETH,entirely--had told the Englishman to tell Lispeth that he was coming
15762,LISPETH,"back to marry her. ""She is but a child, you know, and, I fear, at heart"
15763,LISPETH,"a heathen,"" said the Chaplain's wife. So all the twelve miles up the"
15764,LISPETH,"hill the Englishman, with his arm around Lispeth's waist, was assuring"
15765,LISPETH,the girl that he would come back and marry her; and Lispeth made him
15766,LISPETH,promise over and over again. She wept on the Narkunda Ridge till he had
15767,LISPETH,passed out of sight along the Muttiani path.
15768,LISPETH,
15769,LISPETH,"Then she dried her tears and went in to Kotgarh again, and said to the"
15770,LISPETH,"Chaplain's wife: ""He will come back and marry me. He has gone to his"
15771,LISPETH,"own people to tell them so."" And the Chaplain's wife soothed Lispeth"
15772,LISPETH,"and said: ""He will come back."" At the end of two months, Lispeth grew"
15773,LISPETH,"impatient, and was told that the Englishman had gone over the seas"
15774,LISPETH,"to England. She knew where England was, because she had read little"
15775,LISPETH,"geography primers; but, of course, she had no conception of the nature"
15776,LISPETH,"of the sea, being a Hill girl."
15777,LISPETH,
15778,LISPETH,There was an old puzzle-map of the World in the House. Lispeth had
15779,LISPETH,"played with it when she was a child. She unearthed it again, and put it"
15780,LISPETH,"together of evenings, and cried to herself, and tried to imagine where"
15781,LISPETH,"her Englishman was. As she had no ideas of distance or steamboats,"
15782,LISPETH,her notions were somewhat erroneous. It would not have made the least
15783,LISPETH,difference had she been perfectly correct; for the Englishman had no
15784,LISPETH,intention of coming back to marry a Hill girl. He forgot all about her
15785,LISPETH,by the time he was butterfly-hunting in Assam. He wrote a book on the
15786,LISPETH,East afterwards. Lispeth's name did not appear.
15787,LISPETH,
15788,LISPETH,"At the end of three months, Lispeth made daily pilgrimage to Narkunda"
15789,LISPETH,"to see if her Englishman was coming along the road. It gave her comfort,"
15790,LISPETH,"and the Chaplain's wife, finding her happier, thought that she was"
15791,LISPETH,"getting over her ""barbarous and most indelicate folly."" A little later"
15792,LISPETH,the walks ceased to help Lispeth and her temper grew very bad. The
15793,LISPETH,Chaplain's wife thought this a profitable time to let her know the real
15794,LISPETH,state of affairs--that the Englishman had only promised his love to keep
15795,LISPETH,"her quiet--that he had never meant anything, and that it was ""wrong and"
15796,LISPETH,"improper"" of Lispeth to think of marriage with an Englishman, who was of"
15797,LISPETH,"a superior clay, besides being promised in marriage to a girl of his own"
15798,LISPETH,"people. Lispeth said that all this was clearly impossible, because he"
15799,LISPETH,"had said he loved her, and the Chaplain's wife had, with her own lips,"
15800,LISPETH,asserted that the Englishman was coming back.
15801,LISPETH,
15802,LISPETH,"""How can what he and you said be untrue?"" asked Lispeth."
15803,LISPETH,
15804,LISPETH,"""We said it as an excuse to keep you quiet, child,"" said the Chaplain's"
15805,LISPETH,wife.
15806,LISPETH,
15807,LISPETH,"""Then you have lied to me,"" said Lispeth, ""you and he?"""
15808,LISPETH,
15809,LISPETH,"The Chaplain's wife bowed her head, and said nothing. Lispeth was"
15810,LISPETH,"silent, too for a little time; then she went out down the valley, and"
15811,LISPETH,"returned in the dress of a Hill girl--infamously dirty, but without the"
15812,LISPETH,"nose and ear rings. She had her hair braided into the long pig-tail,"
15813,LISPETH,"helped out with black thread, that Hill women wear."
15814,LISPETH,
15815,LISPETH,"""I am going back to my own people,"" said she. ""You have killed Lispeth."
15816,LISPETH,There is only left old Jadeh's daughter--the daughter of a pahari and
15817,LISPETH,"the servant of Tarka Devi. You are all liars, you English."""
15818,LISPETH,
15819,LISPETH,By the time that the Chaplain's wife had recovered from the shock of the
15820,LISPETH,"announcement that Lispeth had 'verted to her mother's gods, the girl had"
15821,LISPETH,gone; and she never came back.
15822,LISPETH,
15823,LISPETH,"She took to her own unclean people savagely, as if to make up the"
15824,LISPETH,"arrears of the life she had stepped out of; and, in a little time, she"
15825,LISPETH,"married a wood-cutter who beat her, after the manner of paharis, and her"
15826,LISPETH,beauty faded soon.
15827,LISPETH,
15828,LISPETH,"""There is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the"
15829,LISPETH,"heathen,"" said the Chaplain's wife, ""and I believe that Lispeth was"
15830,LISPETH,"always at heart an infidel."" Seeing she had been taken into the Church"
15831,LISPETH,"of England at the mature age of five weeks, this statement does not do"
15832,LISPETH,credit to the Chaplain's wife.
15833,LISPETH,
15834,LISPETH,Lispeth was a very old woman when she died. She always had a perfect
15835,LISPETH,"command of English, and when she was sufficiently drunk, could sometimes"
15836,LISPETH,be induced to tell the story of her first love-affair.
15837,LISPETH,
15838,LISPETH,"It was hard then to realize that the bleared, wrinkled creature, so"
15839,LISPETH,"like a wisp of charred rag, could ever have been ""Lispeth of the Kotgarh"

15854,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,In the case of the Cusack-Bremmils this reaction did not set in till the

15857,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"Bremmil wore black, and grew thin, and mourned as if the bottom of the"

15859,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"tried to do so, I think; but the more he comforted the more Mrs. Bremmil"
15860,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"grieved, and, consequently, the more uncomfortable Bremmil grew. The"

15862,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"can afford to laugh now, but it was no laughing matter to her at the"

15865,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"You see, Mrs. Hauksbee appeared on the horizon; and where she existed"

15921,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,About half-past five in the evening a large leather-covered basket came
15922,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,in from Phelps' for Mrs. Bremmil. She was a woman who knew how to dress;

15924,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"gored, and hemmed, and herring-boned, and tucked and rucked (or whatever"

15926,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"can't describe it, but it was what The Queen calls ""a creation""--a thing"
15927,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,that hit you straight between the eyes and made you gasp. She had not
15928,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,much heart for what she was going to do; but as she glanced at the long
15929,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,mirror she had the satisfaction of knowing that she had never looked so
15930,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"well in her life. She was a large blonde and, when she chose, carried"

15932,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,
15933,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"After the dinner at the Longmores, she went on to the dance--a little"

15935,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,
15936,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"That made her flush, and as the men crowded round her for dances she"

15939,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"war--real war--between them. She started handicapped in the struggle,"
15940,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,for she had ordered Bremmil about just the least little bit in the world
15941,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"too much; and he was beginning to resent it. Moreover, he had never seen"

15949,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"Mrs. Hauksbee did her best to hold him in play, but, after two dances,"

15958,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"Bremmil had a sort of notion that his wife could dance, but he never"

15969,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"shook her finger at him, and said, laughing: ""Oh, you silly, SILLY boy!"""

15971,THREE AND--AN EXTRA.,"Mrs. Hauksbee heard that, and--she owned as much--felt that she had the"

16069,THROWN AWAY.,
16070,THROWN AWAY.,"But this Boy--the tale is as old as the Hills--came out, and took all"
16071,THROWN AWAY.,things seriously. He was pretty and was petted. He took the pettings
16072,THROWN AWAY.,"seriously, and fretted over women not worth saddling a pony to call"
16073,THROWN AWAY.,upon. He found his new free life in India very good.

16075,THROWN AWAY.,"It DOES look attractive in the beginning, from a Subaltern's point of"

16078,THROWN AWAY.,set of teeth. He had no sense of balance--just like the puppy--and could
16079,THROWN AWAY.,not understand why he was not treated with the consideration he received
16080,THROWN AWAY.,under his father's roof. This hurt his feelings.
16081,THROWN AWAY.,
16082,THROWN AWAY.,"He quarrelled with other boys, and, being sensitive to the marrow,"
16083,THROWN AWAY.,"remembered these quarrels, and they excited him. He found whist, and"
16084,THROWN AWAY.,"gymkhanas, and things of that kind (meant to amuse one after office)"
16085,THROWN AWAY.,"good; but he took them seriously too, just as he took the ""head"" that"
16086,THROWN AWAY.,followed after drink. He lost his money over whist and gymkhanas because
16087,THROWN AWAY.,they were new to him.
16088,THROWN AWAY.,
16089,THROWN AWAY.,"He took his losses seriously, and wasted as much energy and interest"
16090,THROWN AWAY.,over a two-gold-mohur race for maiden ekka-ponies with their manes
16091,THROWN AWAY.,"hogged, as if it had been the Derby. One-half of this came from"
16092,THROWN AWAY.,inexperience--much as the puppy squabbles with the corner of the
16093,THROWN AWAY.,hearth-rug--and the other half from the dizziness bred by stumbling out
16094,THROWN AWAY.,of his quiet life into the glare and excitement of a livelier one. No
16095,THROWN AWAY.,one told him about the soap and the blacking because an average man
16096,THROWN AWAY.,takes it for granted that an average man is ordinarily careful in regard
16097,THROWN AWAY.,"to them. It was pitiful to watch The Boy knocking himself to pieces, as"
16098,THROWN AWAY.,an over-handled colt falls down and cuts himself when he gets away from
16099,THROWN AWAY.,the groom.
16100,THROWN AWAY.,
16101,THROWN AWAY.,This unbridled license in amusements not worth the trouble of breaking
16102,THROWN AWAY.,"line for, much less rioting over, endured for six months--all through"
16103,THROWN AWAY.,one cold weather--and then we thought that the heat and the knowledge
16104,THROWN AWAY.,of having lost his money and health and lamed his horses would sober
16105,THROWN AWAY.,"The Boy down, and he would stand steady. In ninety-nine cases out of a"
16106,THROWN AWAY.,hundred this would have happened. You can see the principle working in
16107,THROWN AWAY.,any Indian Station. But this particular case fell through because The
16108,THROWN AWAY.,Boy was sensitive and took things seriously--as I may have said some
16109,THROWN AWAY.,"seven times before. Of course, we couldn't tell how his excesses struck"
16110,THROWN AWAY.,him personally.
16111,THROWN AWAY.,
16112,THROWN AWAY.,They were nothing very heart-breaking or above the average. He might be
16113,THROWN AWAY.,"crippled for life financially, and want a little nursing."
16114,THROWN AWAY.,
16115,THROWN AWAY.,Still the memory of his performances would wither away in one hot
16116,THROWN AWAY.,"weather, and the shroff would help him to tide over the money troubles."
16117,THROWN AWAY.,But he must have taken another view altogether and have believed himself
16118,THROWN AWAY.,ruined beyond redemption. His Colonel talked to him severely when the
16119,THROWN AWAY.,cold weather ended. That made him more wretched than ever; and it was
16120,THROWN AWAY.,"only an ordinary ""Colonel's wigging!"""
16121,THROWN AWAY.,
16122,THROWN AWAY.,What follows is a curious instance of the fashion in which we are all
16123,THROWN AWAY.,linked together and made responsible for one another. THE thing that
16124,THROWN AWAY.,kicked the beam in The Boy's mind was a remark that a woman made when he
16125,THROWN AWAY.,"was talking to her. There is no use in repeating it, for it was only a"
16126,THROWN AWAY.,"cruel little sentence, rapped out before thinking, that made him flush"
16127,THROWN AWAY.,"to the roots of his hair. He kept himself to himself for three days, and"
16128,THROWN AWAY.,then put in for two days' leave to go shooting near a Canal Engineer's
16129,THROWN AWAY.,"Rest House about thirty miles out. He got his leave, and that night"
16130,THROWN AWAY.,at Mess was noisier and more offensive than ever. He said that he was
16131,THROWN AWAY.,"""going to shoot big game,"" and left at half-past ten o'clock in an ekka."
16132,THROWN AWAY.,
16133,THROWN AWAY.,Partridge--which was the only thing a man could get near the Rest
16134,THROWN AWAY.,House--is not big game; so every one laughed.
16135,THROWN AWAY.,
16136,THROWN AWAY.,"Next morning one of the Majors came in from short leave, and heard"
16137,THROWN AWAY.,"that The Boy had gone out to shoot ""big game."" The Major had taken an"
16138,THROWN AWAY.,"interest in The Boy, and had, more than once, tried to check him in"
16139,THROWN AWAY.,the cold weather. The Major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the
16140,THROWN AWAY.,"expedition and went to The Boy's room, where he rummaged."
16141,THROWN AWAY.,
16142,THROWN AWAY.,Presently he came out and found me leaving cards on the Mess.
16143,THROWN AWAY.,
16144,THROWN AWAY.,There was no one else in the ante-room.
16145,THROWN AWAY.,
16146,THROWN AWAY.,"He said: ""The Boy has gone out shooting. DOES a man shoot [missing] with"
16147,THROWN AWAY.,"a revolver and a writing-case?"""
16148,THROWN AWAY.,
16149,THROWN AWAY.,"I said: ""Nonsense, Major!"" for I saw what was in his mind."
16150,THROWN AWAY.,
16151,THROWN AWAY.,"He said: ""Nonsense or nonsense, I'm going to the Canal now--at once. I"
16152,THROWN AWAY.,"don't feel easy."""
16153,THROWN AWAY.,
16154,THROWN AWAY.,"Then he thought for a minute, and said: ""Can you lie?"""
16155,THROWN AWAY.,
16156,THROWN AWAY.,"""You know best,"" I answered. ""It's my profession."""
16157,THROWN AWAY.,
16158,THROWN AWAY.,"""Very well,"" said the Major; ""you must come out with me now--at"
16159,THROWN AWAY.,once--in an ekka to the Canal to shoot black-buck. Go and put on
16160,THROWN AWAY.,"shikar-kit--quick--and drive here with a gun."""
16161,THROWN AWAY.,
16162,THROWN AWAY.,The Major was a masterful man; and I knew that he would not give orders
16163,THROWN AWAY.,"for nothing. So I obeyed, and on return found the Major packed up in an"
16164,THROWN AWAY.,ekka--gun-cases and food slung below--all ready for a shooting-trip.
16165,THROWN AWAY.,
16166,THROWN AWAY.,He dismissed the driver and drove himself. We jogged along quietly
16167,THROWN AWAY.,while in the station; but as soon as we got to the dusty road across the
16168,THROWN AWAY.,"plains, he made that pony fly. A country-bred can do nearly anything at"
16169,THROWN AWAY.,"a pinch. We covered the thirty miles in under three hours, but the poor"
16170,THROWN AWAY.,brute was nearly dead.
16171,THROWN AWAY.,
16172,THROWN AWAY.,"Once I said: ""What's the blazing hurry, Major?"""
16173,THROWN AWAY.,
16174,THROWN AWAY.,"He said, quietly: ""The Boy has been alone, by himself, for--one, two,"
16175,THROWN AWAY.,"five--fourteen hours now! I tell you, I don't feel easy."""
16176,THROWN AWAY.,
16177,THROWN AWAY.,"This uneasiness spread itself to me, and I helped to beat the pony."
16178,THROWN AWAY.,
16179,THROWN AWAY.,When we came to the Canal Engineer's Rest House the Major called for The
16180,THROWN AWAY.,"Boy's servant; but there was no answer. Then we went up to the house,"
16181,THROWN AWAY.,calling for The Boy by name; but there was no answer.
16182,THROWN AWAY.,
16183,THROWN AWAY.,"""Oh, he's out shooting,"" said I."
16184,THROWN AWAY.,
16185,THROWN AWAY.,Just then I saw through one of the windows a little hurricane-lamp
16186,THROWN AWAY.,burning. This was at four in the afternoon. We both stopped dead in the
16187,THROWN AWAY.,"verandah, holding our breath to catch every sound; and we heard, inside"
16188,THROWN AWAY.,"the room, the ""brr--brr--brr"" of a multitude of flies. The Major said"
16189,THROWN AWAY.,"nothing, but he took off his helmet and we entered very softly."
16190,THROWN AWAY.,
16191,THROWN AWAY.,"The Boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare, lime-washed"
16192,THROWN AWAY.,room. He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver. The
16193,THROWN AWAY.,"gun-cases were still strapped, so was the bedding, and on the table lay"
16194,THROWN AWAY.,The Boy's writing-case with photographs. He had gone away to die like a
16195,THROWN AWAY.,poisoned rat!
16196,THROWN AWAY.,
16197,THROWN AWAY.,"The Major said to himself softly: ""Poor Boy! Poor, POOR devil!"" Then he"
16198,THROWN AWAY.,"turned away from the bed and said: ""I want your help in this business."""
16199,THROWN AWAY.,
16200,THROWN AWAY.,"Knowing The Boy was dead by his own hand, I saw exactly what that help"
16201,THROWN AWAY.,"would be, so I passed over to the table, took a chair, lit a cheroot,"
16202,THROWN AWAY.,and began to go through the writing-case; the Major looking over my
16203,THROWN AWAY.,"shoulder and repeating to himself: ""We came too late!--Like a rat in a"
16204,THROWN AWAY.,"hole!--Poor, POOR devil!"""
16205,THROWN AWAY.,
16206,THROWN AWAY.,"The Boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people, and to"
16207,THROWN AWAY.,"his Colonel, and to a girl at Home; and as soon as he had finished, must"
16208,THROWN AWAY.,"have shot himself, for he had been dead a long time when we came in."
16209,THROWN AWAY.,
16210,THROWN AWAY.,"I read all that he had written, and passed over each sheet to the Major"
16211,THROWN AWAY.,as I finished it.
16212,THROWN AWAY.,
16213,THROWN AWAY.,We saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything.
16214,THROWN AWAY.,"He wrote about ""disgrace which he was unable to bear""--""indelible"
16215,THROWN AWAY.,"shame""--""criminal folly""--""wasted life,"" and so on; besides a lot of"
16216,THROWN AWAY.,private things to his Father and Mother too much too sacred to put into
16217,THROWN AWAY.,print. The letter to the girl at Home was the most pitiful of all; and
16218,THROWN AWAY.,I choked as I read it. The Major made no attempt to keep dry-eyed.
16219,THROWN AWAY.,"I respected him for that. He read and rocked himself to and fro, and"
16220,THROWN AWAY.,simply cried like a woman without caring to hide it. The letters were so
16221,THROWN AWAY.,"dreary and hopeless and touching. We forgot all about The Boy's follies,"
16222,THROWN AWAY.,and only thought of the poor Thing on the charpoy and the scrawled
16223,THROWN AWAY.,sheets in our hands. It was utterly impossible to let the letters go
16224,THROWN AWAY.,Home.
16225,THROWN AWAY.,
16226,THROWN AWAY.,They would have broken his Father's heart and killed his Mother after
16227,THROWN AWAY.,killing her belief in her son.
16228,THROWN AWAY.,
16229,THROWN AWAY.,"At last the Major dried his eyes openly, and said: ""Nice sort of thing"
16230,THROWN AWAY.,"to spring on an English family! What shall we do?"""
16231,THROWN AWAY.,
16232,THROWN AWAY.,"I said, knowing what the Major had brought me but for: ""The Boy died"
16233,THROWN AWAY.,of cholera. We were with him at the time. We can't commit ourselves to
16234,THROWN AWAY.,"half-measures. Come along."""
16235,THROWN AWAY.,
16236,THROWN AWAY.,Then began one of the most grimy comic scenes I have ever taken part
16237,THROWN AWAY.,"in--the concoction of a big, written lie, bolstered with evidence, to"
16238,THROWN AWAY.,"soothe The Boy's people at Home. I began the rough draft of a letter,"
16239,THROWN AWAY.,the Major throwing in hints here and there while he gathered up all the
16240,THROWN AWAY.,stuff that The Boy had written and burnt it in the fireplace. It was a
16241,THROWN AWAY.,"hot, still evening when we began, and the lamp burned very badly. In due"
16242,THROWN AWAY.,"course I got the draft to my satisfaction, setting forth how The Boy was"
16243,THROWN AWAY.,"the pattern of all virtues, beloved by his regiment, with every promise"
16244,THROWN AWAY.,"of a great career before him, and so on; how we had helped him through"
16245,THROWN AWAY.,"the sickness--it was no time for little lies, you will understand--and"
16246,THROWN AWAY.,how he had died without pain. I choked while I was putting down these
16247,THROWN AWAY.,things and thinking of the poor people who would read them.
16248,THROWN AWAY.,
16249,THROWN AWAY.,"Then I laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair, and the laughter"
16250,THROWN AWAY.,mixed itself up with the choke--and the Major said that we both wanted
16251,THROWN AWAY.,drinks.
16252,THROWN AWAY.,
16253,THROWN AWAY.,I am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was
16254,THROWN AWAY.,finished. It had not the least effect on us. Then we took off The Boy's
16255,THROWN AWAY.,"watch, locket, and rings."
16256,THROWN AWAY.,
16257,THROWN AWAY.,"Lastly, the Major said: ""We must send a lock of hair too. A woman values"
16258,THROWN AWAY.,"that."""
16259,THROWN AWAY.,
16260,THROWN AWAY.,But there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send.
16261,THROWN AWAY.,
16262,THROWN AWAY.,"The Boy was black-haired, and so was the Major, luckily. I cut off a"
16263,THROWN AWAY.,"piece of the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into"
16264,THROWN AWAY.,the packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of
16265,THROWN AWAY.,"me again, and I had to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and we both"
16266,THROWN AWAY.,knew that the worst part of the work was to come.
16267,THROWN AWAY.,
16268,THROWN AWAY.,"We sealed up the packet, photographs, locket, seals, ring, letter, and"
16269,THROWN AWAY.,lock of hair with The Boy's sealing-wax and The Boy's seal.
16270,THROWN AWAY.,
16271,THROWN AWAY.,"Then the Major said: ""For God's sake let's get outside--away from the"
16272,THROWN AWAY.,"room--and think!"""
16273,THROWN AWAY.,
16274,THROWN AWAY.,"We went outside, and walked on the banks of the Canal for an hour,"
16275,THROWN AWAY.,"eating and drinking what we had with us, until the moon rose. I know now"
16276,THROWN AWAY.,"exactly how a murderer feels. Finally, we forced ourselves back to the"
16277,THROWN AWAY.,"room with the lamp and the Other Thing in it, and began to take up"
16278,THROWN AWAY.,the next piece of work. I am not going to write about this. It was too
16279,THROWN AWAY.,horrible. We burned the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the Canal;
16280,THROWN AWAY.,we took up the matting of the room and treated that in the same way.
16281,THROWN AWAY.,I went off to a village and borrowed two big hoes--I did not want the
16282,THROWN AWAY.,villagers to help--while the Major arranged--the other matters. It took
16283,THROWN AWAY.,"us four hours' hard work to make the grave. As we worked, we argued out"
16284,THROWN AWAY.,whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of the Burial of

16286,THROWN AWAY.,
16287,THROWN AWAY.,We compromised things by saying the Lord's Prayer with a private
16288,THROWN AWAY.,unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy. Then we filled
16289,THROWN AWAY.,in the grave and went into the verandah--not the house--to lie down to
16290,THROWN AWAY.,sleep. We were dead-tired.
16291,THROWN AWAY.,
16292,THROWN AWAY.,"When we woke the Major said, wearily: ""We can't go back till tomorrow."
16293,THROWN AWAY.,"We must give him a decent time to die in. He died early THIS morning,"
16294,THROWN AWAY.,"remember. That seems more natural."" So the Major must have been lying"
16295,THROWN AWAY.,"awake all the time, thinking."
16296,THROWN AWAY.,
16297,THROWN AWAY.,"I said: ""Then why didn't we bring the body back to the cantonments?"""
16298,THROWN AWAY.,
16299,THROWN AWAY.,"The Major thought for a minute:--""Because the people bolted when they"
16300,THROWN AWAY.,"heard of the cholera. And the ekka has gone!"""
16301,THROWN AWAY.,
16302,THROWN AWAY.,"That was strictly true. We had forgotten all about the ekka-pony, and he"
16303,THROWN AWAY.,had gone home.
16304,THROWN AWAY.,
16305,THROWN AWAY.,"So, we were left there alone, all that stifling day, in the Canal Rest"
16306,THROWN AWAY.,"House, testing and re-testing our story of The Boy's death to see if it"
16307,THROWN AWAY.,"was weak at any point. A native turned up in the afternoon, but we said"
16308,THROWN AWAY.,"that a Sahib was dead of cholera, and he ran away. As the dusk gathered,"
16309,THROWN AWAY.,"the Major told me all his fears about The Boy, and awful stories of"
16310,THROWN AWAY.,suicide or nearly-carried-out suicide--tales that made one's hair crisp.
16311,THROWN AWAY.,He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the Shadow
16312,THROWN AWAY.,"as the Boy, when he was young and new to the country; so he understood"
16313,THROWN AWAY.,how things fought together in The Boy's poor jumbled head. He also said
16314,THROWN AWAY.,"that youngsters, in their repentant moments, consider their sins much"
16315,THROWN AWAY.,more serious and ineffaceable than they really are. We talked together
16316,THROWN AWAY.,"all through the evening, and rehearsed the story of the death of The"
16317,THROWN AWAY.,"Boy. As soon as the moon was up, and The Boy, theoretically, just"
16318,THROWN AWAY.,"buried, we struck across country for the Station. We walked from eight"
16319,THROWN AWAY.,"till six o'clock in the morning; but though we were dead-tired, we did"
16320,THROWN AWAY.,not forget to go to The Boy's room and put away his revolver with the
16321,THROWN AWAY.,proper amount of cartridges in the pouch. Also to set his writing-case
16322,THROWN AWAY.,"on the table. We found the Colonel and reported the death, feeling more"
16323,THROWN AWAY.,like murderers than ever. Then we went to bed and slept the clock round;
16324,THROWN AWAY.,for there was no more in us.
16325,THROWN AWAY.,
16326,THROWN AWAY.,"The tale had credence as long as was necessary, for every one forgot"
16327,THROWN AWAY.,"about The Boy before a fortnight was over. Many people, however, found"
16328,THROWN AWAY.,time to say that the Major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in
16329,THROWN AWAY.,the body for a regimental funeral. The saddest thing of all was a letter
16330,THROWN AWAY.,from The Boy's mother to the Major and me--with big inky blisters all
16331,THROWN AWAY.,over the sheet. She wrote the sweetest possible things about our great
16332,THROWN AWAY.,"kindness, and the obligation she would be under to us as long as she"
16333,THROWN AWAY.,lived.
16334,THROWN AWAY.,
16335,THROWN AWAY.,"All things considered, she WAS under an obligation; but not exactly as"

16346,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,Some people say that there is no romance in India. Those people are
16347,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,wrong. Our lives hold quite as much romance as is good for us.

16350,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,
16351,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"Strickland was in the Police, and people did not understand him; so"
16352,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,they said he was a doubtful sort of man and passed by on the other side.
16353,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,Strickland had himself to thank for this. He held the extraordinary
16354,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,theory that a Policeman in India should try to know as much about the
16355,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"natives as the natives themselves. Now, in the whole of Upper India,"
16356,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"there is only ONE man who can pass for Hindu or Mohammedan, chamar or"
16357,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"faquir, as he pleases. He is feared and respected by the natives from"
16358,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,the Ghor Kathri to the Jamma Musjid; and he is supposed to have the gift
16359,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,of invisibility and executive control over many Devils. But what good
16360,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,has this done him with the Government? None in the world. He has never
16361,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,got Simla for his charge; and his name is almost unknown to Englishmen.
16362,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,
16363,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"Strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model; and,"
16364,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"following out his absurd theory, dabbled in unsavory places no"
16365,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,respectable man would think of exploring--all among the native
16366,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"riff-raff. He educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years, and"
16367,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"people could not appreciate it. He was perpetually ""going Fantee"" among"
16368,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"the natives, which, of course, no man with any sense believes in. He was"
16369,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"initiated into the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once, when he was on leave; he"
16370,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"knew the Lizard-Song of the Sansis, and the Halli-Hukk dance, which is"
16371,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,a religious can-can of a startling kind. When a man knows who dances the
16372,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"Halli-Hukk, and how, and when, and where, he knows something to be proud"
16373,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"of. He has gone deeper than the skin. But Strickland was not proud,"
16374,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"though he had helped once, at Jagadhri, at the Painting of the Death"
16375,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"Bull, which no Englishman must even look upon; had mastered the"
16376,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,thieves'-patter of the changars; had taken a Eusufzai horse-thief alone
16377,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,near Attock; and had stood under the mimbar-board of a Border mosque and
16378,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,conducted service in the manner of a Sunni Mollah.
16379,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,
16380,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the
16381,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"gardens of Baba Atal at Amritsar, and there picking up the threads of"
16382,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"the great Nasiban Murder Case. But people said, justly enough: ""Why on"
16383,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"earth can't Strickland sit in his office and write up his diary, and"
16384,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"recruit, and keep quiet, instead of showing up the incapacity of his"
16385,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"seniors?"" So the Nasiban Murder Case did him no good departmentally;"
16386,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"but, after his first feeling of wrath, he returned to his outlandish"
16387,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"custom of prying into native life. By the way, when a man once acquires"
16388,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"a taste for this particular amusement, it abides with him all his days."
16389,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,It is the most fascinating thing in the world; Love not excepted. Where
16390,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"other men took ten days to the Hills, Strickland took leave for what"
16391,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"he called shikar, put on the disguise that appealed to him at the time,"
16392,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"stepped down into the brown crowd, and was swallowed up for a while. He"
16393,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"was a quiet, dark young fellow--spare, black-eyes--and, when he was not"
16394,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"thinking of something else, a very interesting companion. Strickland"
16395,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,on Native Progress as he had seen it was worth hearing. Natives hated
16396,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,Strickland; but they were afraid of him. He knew too much.
16397,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,
16398,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"When the Youghals came into the station, Strickland--very gravely, as he"
16399,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"did everything--fell in love with Miss Youghal; and she, after a"
16400,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"while, fell in love with him because she could not understand him. Then"
16401,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,Strickland told the parents; but Mrs. Youghal said she was not going to
16402,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"throw her daughter into the worst paid Department in the Empire, and old"
16403,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"Youghal said, in so many words, that he mistrusted Strickland's ways"
16404,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"and works, and would thank him not to speak or write to his daughter"
16405,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"any more. ""Very well,"" said Strickland, for he did not wish to make"
16406,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,his lady-love's life a burden. After one long talk with Miss Youghal he
16407,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,dropped the business entirely.
16408,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,
16409,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,The Youghals went up to Simla in April.
16410,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,
16411,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"In July, Strickland secured three months' leave on ""urgent private"

16414,MISS YOUGHAL'S SAIS.,"went down to see a friend of his, an old dyer, at Tarn Taran."

16567,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"But the one who wept most, and most openly was Miss Agnes Laiter. She"
16568,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"had reason to cry, because the only man she ever loved--or ever could"
16569,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"love, so she said--was going out to India; and India, as every one"
16570,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"knows, is divided equally between jungle, tigers, cobras, cholera, and"
16571,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,sepoys.
16572,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16573,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Phil Garron, leaning over the side of the steamer in the rain, felt very"
16574,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"unhappy too; but he did not cry. He was sent out to ""tea."" What ""tea"""
16575,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"meant he had not the vaguest idea, but fancied that he would have to"
16576,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"ride on a prancing horse over hills covered with tea-vines, and draw a"
16577,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,sumptuous salary for doing so; and he was very grateful to his uncle
16578,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"for getting him the berth. He was really going to reform all his slack,"
16579,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"shiftless ways, save a large proportion of his magnificent salary"
16580,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"yearly, and, in a very short time, return to marry Agnes Laiter. Phil"
16581,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Garron had been lying loose on his friends' hands for three years, and,"
16582,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"as he had nothing to do, he naturally fell in love. He was very nice;"
16583,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"but he was not strong in his views and opinions and principles, and"
16584,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,though he never came to actual grief his friends were thankful when
16585,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"he said good-bye, and went out to this mysterious ""tea"" business near"
16586,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Darjiling. They said:--""God bless you, dear boy! Let us never see your"
16587,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"face again,""--or at least that was what Phil was given to understand."
16588,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16589,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"When he sailed, he was very full of a great plan to prove himself"
16590,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,several hundred times better than any one had given him credit for--to
16591,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"work like a horse, and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter. He had many good"
16592,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"points besides his good looks; his only fault being that he was weak,"
16593,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,the least little bit in the world weak. He had as much notion of economy
16594,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"as the Morning Sun; and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item,"
16595,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"and say: ""Herein Phil Garron is extravagant or reckless."" Nor could"
16596,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,you point out any particular vice in his character; but he was
16597,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"""unsatisfactory"" and as workable as putty."
16598,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16599,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,Agnes Laiter went about her duties at home--her family objected to the
16600,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"engagement--with red eyes, while Phil was sailing to Darjiling--""a port"
16601,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"on the Bengal Ocean,"" as his mother used to tell her friends. He was"
16602,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"popular enough on board ship, made many acquaintances and a moderately"
16603,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"large liquor bill, and sent off huge letters to Agnes Laiter at each"
16604,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"port. Then he fell to work on this plantation, somewhere between"
16605,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Darjiling and Kangra, and, though the salary and the horse and the work"
16606,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"were not quite all he had fancied, he succeeded fairly well, and gave"
16607,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,himself much unnecessary credit for his perseverance.
16608,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16609,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"In the course of time, as he settled more into collar, and his work grew"
16610,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"fixed before him, the face of Agnes Laiter went out of his mind and only"
16611,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"came when he was at leisure, which was not often. He would forget"
16612,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"all about her for a fortnight, and remember her with a start, like a"
16613,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,school-boy who has forgotten to learn his lesson.
16614,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16615,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"She did not forget Phil, because she was of the kind that never forgets."
16616,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Only, another man--a really desirable young man--presented himself"
16617,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,before Mrs. Laiter; and the chance of a marriage with Phil was as far
16618,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,off as ever; and his letters were so unsatisfactory; and there was a
16619,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,certain amount of domestic pressure brought to bear on the girl; and the
16620,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,young man really was an eligible person as incomes go; and the end of
16621,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"all things was that Agnes married him, and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind"
16622,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"of a letter to Phil in the wilds of Darjiling, and said she should never"
16623,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,know a happy moment all the rest of her life. Which was a true prophecy.
16624,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16625,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Phil got that letter, and held himself ill-treated. This was two years"
16626,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"after he had come out; but by dint of thinking fixedly of Agnes Laiter,"
16627,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"and looking at her photograph, and patting himself on the back for being"
16628,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"one of the most constant lovers in history, and warming to the work as"
16629,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"he went on, he really fancied that he had been very hardly used. He sat"
16630,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"down and wrote one final letter--a really pathetic ""world without end,"
16631,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"amen,"" epistle; explaining how he would be true to Eternity, and that"
16632,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"all women were very much alike, and he would hide his broken heart,"
16633,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"etc., etc.; but if, at any future time, etc., etc., he could afford to"
16634,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"wait, etc., etc., unchanged affections, etc., etc., return to her old"
16635,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"love, etc., etc., for eight closely-written pages. From an artistic"
16636,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"point of view, it was very neat work, but an ordinary Philistine, who"
16637,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,knew the state of Phil's real feelings--not the ones he rose to as he
16638,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,went on writing--would have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish
16639,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"work of a thoroughly mean and selfish, weak man. But this verdict would"
16640,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"have been incorrect. Phil paid for the postage, and felt every word he"
16641,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,had written for at least two days and a half.
16642,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16643,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,It was the last flicker before the light went out.
16644,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16645,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"That letter made Agnes Laiter very unhappy, and she cried and put it"
16646,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"away in her desk, and became Mrs. Somebody Else for the good of her"
16647,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,family. Which is the first duty of every Christian maid.
16648,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16649,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Phil went his ways, and thought no more of his letter, except as an"
16650,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"artist thinks of a neatly touched-in sketch. His ways were not bad, but"
16651,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"they were not altogether good until they brought him across Dunmaya, the"
16652,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,daughter of a Rajput ex-Subadar-Major of our Native Army. The girl had a
16653,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"strain of Hill blood in her, and, like the Hill women, was not a purdah"
16654,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"nashin. Where Phil met her, or how he heard of her, does not matter. She"
16655,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"was a good girl and handsome, and, in her way, very clever and shrewd;"
16656,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"though, of course, a little hard. It is to be remembered that Phil was"
16657,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"living very comfortably, denying himself no small luxury, never putting"
16658,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"by an anna, very satisfied with himself and his good intentions, was"
16659,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"dropping all his English correspondents one by one, and beginning more"
16660,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,and more to look upon this land as his home. Some men fall this way; and
16661,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,they are of no use afterwards. The climate where he was stationed was
16662,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"good, and it really did not seem to him that there was anything to go"
16663,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,Home for.
16664,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16665,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"He did what many planters have done before him--that is to say, he"
16666,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,made up his mind to marry a Hill girl and settle down. He was seven and
16667,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"twenty then, with a long life before him, but no spirit to go through"
16668,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"with it. So he married Dunmaya by the forms of the English Church, and"
16669,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"some fellow-planters said he was a fool, and some said he was a"
16670,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"wise man. Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl, and, in spite of her"
16671,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"reverence for an Englishman, had a reasonable estimate of her husband's"
16672,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"weaknesses. She managed him tenderly, and became, in less than a year, a"
16673,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,very passable imitation of an English lady in dress and carriage. [It
16674,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"is curious to think that a Hill man, after a lifetime's education, is"
16675,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,a Hill man still; but a Hill woman can in six months master most of the
16676,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,ways of her English sisters. There was a coolie woman once. But that is
16677,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"another story.] Dunmaya dressed by preference in black and yellow, and"
16678,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,looked well.
16679,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16680,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Meantime the letter lay in Agnes's desk, and now and again she would"
16681,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,think of poor resolute hard-working Phil among the cobras and tigers of
16682,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Darjiling, toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him. Her"
16683,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"husband was worth ten Phils, except that he had rheumatism of the"
16684,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,heart. Three years after he was married--and after he had tried Nice
16685,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"and Algeria for his complaint--he went to Bombay, where he died, and set"
16686,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Agnes free. Being a devout woman, she looked on his death and the"
16687,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"place of it, as a direct interposition of Providence, and when she had"
16688,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"recovered from the shock, she took out and reread Phil's letter with the"
16689,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"""etc., etc.,"" and the big dashes, and the little dashes, and kissed it"
16690,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"several times. No one knew her in Bombay; she had her husband's income,"
16691,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"which was a large one, and Phil was close at hand. It was wrong and"
16692,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"improper, of course, but she decided, as heroines do in novels, to find"
16693,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"her old lover, to offer him her hand and her gold, and with him spend"
16694,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,the rest of her life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls. She sat
16695,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"for two months, alone in Watson's Hotel, elaborating this decision, and"
16696,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"the picture was a pretty one. Then she set out in search of Phil Garron,"
16697,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,Assistant on a tea plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable
16698,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,name..........
16699,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16700,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"She found him. She spent a month over it, for his plantation was not in"
16701,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"the Darjiling district at all, but nearer Kangra. Phil was very little"
16702,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"altered, and Dunmaya was very nice to her."
16703,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16704,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Now the particular sin and shame of the whole business is that Phil, who"
16705,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"really is not worth thinking of twice, was and is loved by Dunmaya,"
16706,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"and more than loved by Agnes, the whole of whose life he seems to have"
16707,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,spoilt.
16708,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16709,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,"Worst of all, Dunmaya is making a decent man of him; and he will be"
16710,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,ultimately saved from perdition through her training.
16711,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,
16712,YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER.,Which is manifestly unfair.

16736,FALSE DAWN.,
16737,FALSE DAWN.,Saumarez knew this when he made up his mind to propose to the elder Miss
16738,FALSE DAWN.,"Copleigh. Saumarez was a strange man, with few merits, so far as men"
16739,FALSE DAWN.,"could see, though he was popular with women, and carried enough"
16740,FALSE DAWN.,conceit to stock a Viceroy's Council and leave a little over for the
16741,FALSE DAWN.,Commander-in-Chief's Staff. He was a Civilian. Very many women took an
16742,FALSE DAWN.,"interest in Saumarez, perhaps, because his manner to them was offensive."
16743,FALSE DAWN.,"If you hit a pony over the nose at the outset of your acquaintance, he"
16744,FALSE DAWN.,"may not love you, but he will take a deep interest in your movements"
16745,FALSE DAWN.,"ever afterwards. The elder Miss Copleigh was nice, plump, winning and"
16746,FALSE DAWN.,"pretty. The younger was not so pretty, and, from men disregarding the"
16747,FALSE DAWN.,"hint set forth above, her style was repellant and unattractive. Both"
16748,FALSE DAWN.,"girls had, practically, the same figure, and there was a strong likeness"
16749,FALSE DAWN.,between them in look and voice; though no one could doubt for an instant
16750,FALSE DAWN.,which was the nicer of the two.
16751,FALSE DAWN.,
16752,FALSE DAWN.,"Saumarez made up his mind, as soon as they came into the station from"
16753,FALSE DAWN.,"Behar, to marry the elder one. At least, we all made sure that he"
16754,FALSE DAWN.,"would, which comes to the same thing. She was two and twenty, and he was"
16755,FALSE DAWN.,"thirty-three, with pay and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees"
16756,FALSE DAWN.,"a month. So the match, as we arranged it, was in every way a good one."
16757,FALSE DAWN.,"Saumarez was his name, and summary was his nature, as a man once said."
16758,FALSE DAWN.,"Having drafted his Resolution, he formed a Select Committee of One to"
16759,FALSE DAWN.,"sit upon it, and resolved to take his time. In our unpleasant slang, the"
16760,FALSE DAWN.,"Copleigh girls ""hunted in couples."" That is to say, you could do nothing"
16761,FALSE DAWN.,with one without the other. They were very loving sisters; but
16762,FALSE DAWN.,their mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient. Saumarez held the
16763,FALSE DAWN.,"balance-hair true between them, and none but himself could have said to"
16764,FALSE DAWN.,which side his heart inclined; though every one guessed. He rode
16765,FALSE DAWN.,"with them a good deal and danced with them, but he never succeeded in"
16766,FALSE DAWN.,detaching them from each other for any length of time.
16767,FALSE DAWN.,
16768,FALSE DAWN.,"Women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust, each"
16769,FALSE DAWN.,fearing that the other would steal a march on her. But that has nothing
16770,FALSE DAWN.,"to do with a man. Saumarez was silent for good or bad, and as"
16771,FALSE DAWN.,"business--likely attentive as he could be, having due regard to his work"
16772,FALSE DAWN.,and his polo. Beyond doubt both girls were fond of him.
16773,FALSE DAWN.,
16774,FALSE DAWN.,"As the hot weather drew nearer, and Saumarez made no sign, women said"
16775,FALSE DAWN.,that you could see their trouble in the eyes of the girls--that they
16776,FALSE DAWN.,"were looking strained, anxious, and irritable. Men are quite blind in"
16777,FALSE DAWN.,these matters unless they have more of the woman than the man in their
16778,FALSE DAWN.,"composition, in which case it does not matter what they say or think."
16779,FALSE DAWN.,I maintain it was the hot April days that took the color out of the
16780,FALSE DAWN.,Copleigh girls' cheeks. They should have been sent to the Hills
16781,FALSE DAWN.,early. No one--man or woman--feels an angel when the hot weather is
16782,FALSE DAWN.,approaching. The younger sister grew more cynical--not to say acid--in
16783,FALSE DAWN.,her ways; and the winningness of the elder wore thin. There was more
16784,FALSE DAWN.,effort in it.
16785,FALSE DAWN.,
16786,FALSE DAWN.,"Now the Station wherein all these things happened was, though not"
16787,FALSE DAWN.,"a little one, off the line of rail, and suffered through want of"
16788,FALSE DAWN.,attention. There were no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking
16789,FALSE DAWN.,"of, and it was nearly a day's journey to come into Lahore for a dance."
16790,FALSE DAWN.,People were grateful for small things to interest them.
16791,FALSE DAWN.,
16792,FALSE DAWN.,"About the beginning of May, and just before the final exodus of"
16793,FALSE DAWN.,"Hill-goers, when the weather was very hot and there were not more than"
16794,FALSE DAWN.,"twenty people in the Station, Saumarez gave a moonlight riding-picnic at"
16795,FALSE DAWN.,"an old tomb, six miles away, near the bed of the river. It was a ""Noah's"
16796,FALSE DAWN.,"Ark"" picnic; and there was to be the usual arrangement of quarter-mile"
16797,FALSE DAWN.,"intervals between each couple, on account of the dust. Six couples came"
16798,FALSE DAWN.,"altogether, including chaperons. Moonlight picnics are useful just at"
16799,FALSE DAWN.,"the very end of the season, before all the girls go away to the Hills."
16800,FALSE DAWN.,"They lead to understandings, and should be encouraged by chaperones;"
16801,FALSE DAWN.,especially those whose girls look sweetish in riding habits. I knew a
16802,FALSE DAWN.,"case once. But that is another story. That picnic was called the ""Great"
16803,FALSE DAWN.,"Pop Picnic,"" because every one knew Saumarez would propose then to the"
16804,FALSE DAWN.,"eldest Miss Copleigh; and, beside his affair, there was another which"
16805,FALSE DAWN.,might possibly come to happiness.
16806,FALSE DAWN.,
16807,FALSE DAWN.,The social atmosphere was heavily charged and wanted clearing.
16808,FALSE DAWN.,
16809,FALSE DAWN.,We met at the parade-ground at ten: the night was fearfully hot.
16810,FALSE DAWN.,
16811,FALSE DAWN.,"The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but anything was better than"
16812,FALSE DAWN.,sitting still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full
16813,FALSE DAWN.,"moon we were four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the"
16814,FALSE DAWN.,"Copleigh girls, and I loitered at the tail of the procession, wondering"
16815,FALSE DAWN.,with whom Saumarez would ride home. Every one was happy and contented;
16816,FALSE DAWN.,but we all felt that things were going to happen. We rode slowly: and
16817,FALSE DAWN.,"it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb, facing the ruined"
16818,FALSE DAWN.,"tank, in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink. I"
16819,FALSE DAWN.,"was late in coming up; and before I went into the garden, I saw that the"
16820,FALSE DAWN.,"horizon to the north carried a faint, dun-colored feather. But no one"
16821,FALSE DAWN.,would have thanked me for spoiling so well-managed an entertainment as
16822,FALSE DAWN.,"this picnic--and a dust-storm, more or less, does no great harm."
16823,FALSE DAWN.,
16824,FALSE DAWN.,We gathered by the tank. Some one had brought out a banjo--which is a
16825,FALSE DAWN.,most sentimental instrument--and three or four of us sang.
16826,FALSE DAWN.,
16827,FALSE DAWN.,You must not laugh at this. Our amusements in out-of-the-way Stations
16828,FALSE DAWN.,"are very few indeed. Then we talked in groups or together, lying under"
16829,FALSE DAWN.,"the trees, with the sun-baked roses dropping their petals on our feet,"
16830,FALSE DAWN.,"until supper was ready. It was a beautiful supper, as cold and as iced"
16831,FALSE DAWN.,as you could wish; and we stayed long over it.
16832,FALSE DAWN.,
16833,FALSE DAWN.,I had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter; but nobody
16834,FALSE DAWN.,seemed to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began
16835,FALSE DAWN.,lashing the orange-trees with a sound like the noise of the sea. Before
16836,FALSE DAWN.,"we knew where we were, the dust-storm was on us, and everything was"
16837,FALSE DAWN.,"roaring, whirling darkness. The supper-table was blown bodily into the"
16838,FALSE DAWN.,tank. We were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it
16839,FALSE DAWN.,might be blown down. So we felt our way to the orange-trees where the
16840,FALSE DAWN.,horses were picketed and waited for the storm to blow over. Then the
16841,FALSE DAWN.,"little light that was left vanished, and you could not see your hand"
16842,FALSE DAWN.,before your face. The air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed
16843,FALSE DAWN.,"of the river, that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and"
16844,FALSE DAWN.,coated eyebrows and moustaches. It was one of the worst dust-storms of
16845,FALSE DAWN.,the year.
16846,FALSE DAWN.,
16847,FALSE DAWN.,"We were all huddled together close to the trembling horses, with the"
16848,FALSE DAWN.,"thunder clattering overhead, and the lightning spurting like water from"
16849,FALSE DAWN.,"a sluice, all ways at once. There was no danger, of course, unless the"
16850,FALSE DAWN.,horses broke loose. I was standing with my head downward and my hands
16851,FALSE DAWN.,"over my mouth, hearing the trees thrashing each other. I could not see"
16852,FALSE DAWN.,who was next me till the flashes came.
16853,FALSE DAWN.,
16854,FALSE DAWN.,Then I found that I was packed near Saumarez and the eldest Miss
16855,FALSE DAWN.,"Copleigh, with my own horse just in front of me. I recognized the eldest"
16856,FALSE DAWN.,"Miss Copleigh, because she had a pagri round her helmet, and the younger"
16857,FALSE DAWN.,had not. All the electricity in the air had gone into my body and I was
16858,FALSE DAWN.,quivering and tingling from head to foot--exactly as a corn shoots and
16859,FALSE DAWN.,tingles before rain. It was a grand storm.
16860,FALSE DAWN.,
16861,FALSE DAWN.,The wind seemed to be picking up the earth and pitching it to leeward in
16862,FALSE DAWN.,great heaps; and the heat beat up from the ground like the heat of the
16863,FALSE DAWN.,Day of Judgment.
16864,FALSE DAWN.,
16865,FALSE DAWN.,"The storm lulled slightly after the first half-hour, and I heard a"
16866,FALSE DAWN.,"despairing little voice close to my ear, saying to itself, quietly and"
16867,FALSE DAWN.,"softly, as if some lost soul were flying about with the wind: ""O my"
16868,FALSE DAWN.,"God!"" Then the younger Miss Copleigh stumbled into my arms, saying:"
16869,FALSE DAWN.,"""Where is my horse? Get my horse. I want to go home. I WANT to go home."
16870,FALSE DAWN.,"Take me home."""
16871,FALSE DAWN.,
16872,FALSE DAWN.,I thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her;
16873,FALSE DAWN.,"so I said there was no danger, but she must wait till the storm blew"
16874,FALSE DAWN.,"over. She answered: ""It is not THAT! It is not THAT! I want to go home!"
16875,FALSE DAWN.,"O take me away from here!"""
16876,FALSE DAWN.,
16877,FALSE DAWN.,I said that she could not go till the light came; but I felt her brush
16878,FALSE DAWN.,past me and go away. It was too dark to see where. Then the whole sky
16879,FALSE DAWN.,"was split open with one tremendous flash, as if the end of the world"
16880,FALSE DAWN.,"were coming, and all the women shrieked."
16881,FALSE DAWN.,
16882,FALSE DAWN.,"Almost directly after this, I felt a man's hand on my shoulder and heard"
16883,FALSE DAWN.,Saumarez bellowing in my ear. Through the rattling of the trees and
16884,FALSE DAWN.,"howling of the wind, I did not catch his words at once, but at last"
16885,FALSE DAWN.,"I heard him say: ""I've proposed to the wrong one! What shall I do?"""
16886,FALSE DAWN.,Saumarez had no occasion to make this confidence to me. I was never a
16887,FALSE DAWN.,"friend of his, nor am I now; but I fancy neither of us were ourselves"
16888,FALSE DAWN.,"just then. He was shaking as he stood with excitement, and I was feeling"
16889,FALSE DAWN.,queer all over with the electricity.
16890,FALSE DAWN.,
16891,FALSE DAWN.,"I could not think of anything to say except:--""More fool you for"
16892,FALSE DAWN.,"proposing in a dust-storm."" But I did not see how that would improve the"
16893,FALSE DAWN.,mistake.
16894,FALSE DAWN.,
16895,FALSE DAWN.,"Then he shouted: ""Where's Edith--Edith Copleigh?"" Edith was the youngest"
16896,FALSE DAWN.,"sister. I answered out of my astonishment:--""What do you want with HER?"""
16897,FALSE DAWN.,"Would you believe it, for the next two minutes, he and I were shouting"
16898,FALSE DAWN.,at each other like maniacs--he vowing that it was the youngest sister he
16899,FALSE DAWN.,"had meant to propose to all along, and I telling him till my throat"
16900,FALSE DAWN.,was hoarse that he must have made a mistake! I can't account for
16901,FALSE DAWN.,"this except, again, by the fact that we were neither of us ourselves."
16902,FALSE DAWN.,Everything seemed to me like a bad dream--from the stamping of the
16903,FALSE DAWN.,horses in the darkness to Saumarez telling me the story of his loving
16904,FALSE DAWN.,Edith Copleigh since the first. He was still clawing my shoulder and
16905,FALSE DAWN.,"begging me to tell him where Edith Copleigh was, when another lull came"
16906,FALSE DAWN.,"and brought light with it, and we saw the dust-cloud forming on the"
16907,FALSE DAWN.,plain in front of us. So we knew the worst was over. The moon was low
16908,FALSE DAWN.,"down, and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about"
16909,FALSE DAWN.,"an hour before the real one. But the light was very faint, and the dun"
16910,FALSE DAWN.,cloud roared like a bull. I wondered where Edith Copleigh had gone; and
16911,FALSE DAWN.,as I was wondering I saw three things together: First Maud Copleigh's
16912,FALSE DAWN.,"face come smiling out of the darkness and move towards Saumarez, who was"
16913,FALSE DAWN.,"standing by me. I heard the girl whisper, ""George,"" and slide her arm"
16914,FALSE DAWN.,"through the arm that was not clawing my shoulder, and I saw that look on"
16915,FALSE DAWN.,her face which only comes once or twice in a lifetime--when a woman is
16916,FALSE DAWN.,perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeous-colored
16917,FALSE DAWN.,fire and the Earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved. At
16918,FALSE DAWN.,"the same time, I saw Saumarez's face as he heard Maud Copleigh's voice,"
16919,FALSE DAWN.,and fifty yards away from the clump of orange-trees I saw a brown
16920,FALSE DAWN.,holland habit getting upon a horse.
16921,FALSE DAWN.,
16922,FALSE DAWN.,It must have been my state of over-excitement that made me so quick
16923,FALSE DAWN.,to meddle with what did not concern me. Saumarez was moving off to the
16924,FALSE DAWN.,"habit; but I pushed him back and said:--""Stop here and explain. I'll"
16925,FALSE DAWN.,"fetch her back!"" and I ran out to get at my own horse. I had a perfectly"
16926,FALSE DAWN.,"unnecessary notion that everything must be done decently and in order,"
16927,FALSE DAWN.,and that Saumarez's first care was to wipe the happy look out of Maud
16928,FALSE DAWN.,Copleigh's face. All the time I was linking up the curb-chain I wondered
16929,FALSE DAWN.,how he would do it.
16930,FALSE DAWN.,
16931,FALSE DAWN.,"I cantered after Edith Copleigh, thinking to bring her back slowly on"
16932,FALSE DAWN.,"some pretence or another. But she galloped away as soon as she saw me,"
16933,FALSE DAWN.,and I was forced to ride after her in earnest. She called back over her
16934,FALSE DAWN.,"shoulder--""Go away! I'm going home. Oh, go away!"" two or three times;"
16935,FALSE DAWN.,"but my business was to catch her first, and argue later. The ride just"
16936,FALSE DAWN.,"fitted in with the rest of the evil dream. The ground was very bad, and"
16937,FALSE DAWN.,"now and again we rushed through the whirling, choking ""dust-devils"" in"
16938,FALSE DAWN.,the skirts of the flying storm. There was a burning hot wind blowing
16939,FALSE DAWN.,that brought up a stench of stale brick-kilns with it; and through the
16940,FALSE DAWN.,"half light and through the dust-devils, across that desolate plain,"
16941,FALSE DAWN.,flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse. She headed for
16942,FALSE DAWN.,the Station at first. Then she wheeled round and set off for the river
16943,FALSE DAWN.,"through beds of burnt down jungle-grass, bad even to ride a pig over. In"
16944,FALSE DAWN.,cold blood I should never have dreamed of going over such a country
16945,FALSE DAWN.,"at night, but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning"
16946,FALSE DAWN.,"crackling overhead, and a reek like the smell of the Pit in my nostrils."
16947,FALSE DAWN.,"I rode and shouted, and she bent forward and lashed her horse, and the"
16948,FALSE DAWN.,"aftermath of the dust-storm came up and caught us both, and drove us"
16949,FALSE DAWN.,downwind like pieces of paper.
16950,FALSE DAWN.,
16951,FALSE DAWN.,I don't know how far we rode; but the drumming of the horse-hoofs and
16952,FALSE DAWN.,the roar of the wind and the race of the faint blood-red moon through
16953,FALSE DAWN.,"the yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years, and I was"
16954,FALSE DAWN.,literally drenched with sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray
16955,FALSE DAWN.,"stumbled, recovered himself, and pulled up dead lame. My brute was used"
16956,FALSE DAWN.,"up altogether. Edith Copleigh was in a sad state, plastered with dust,"
16957,FALSE DAWN.,"her helmet off, and crying bitterly. ""Why can't you let me alone?"" she"
16958,FALSE DAWN.,"said. ""I only wanted to get away and go home. Oh, PLEASE let me go!"""
16959,FALSE DAWN.,
16960,FALSE DAWN.,"""You have got to come back with me, Miss Copleigh. Saumarez has"
16961,FALSE DAWN.,"something to say to you."""
16962,FALSE DAWN.,
16963,FALSE DAWN.,It was a foolish way of putting it; but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh;
16964,FALSE DAWN.,"and, though I was playing Providence at the cost of my horse, I could"
16965,FALSE DAWN.,not tell her in as many words what Saumarez had told me. I thought he
16966,FALSE DAWN.,could do that better himself. All her pretence about being tired and
16967,FALSE DAWN.,"wanting to go home broke down, and she rocked herself to and fro in the"
16968,FALSE DAWN.,"saddle as she sobbed, and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward. I"
16969,FALSE DAWN.,"am not going to repeat what she said, because she was utterly unstrung."
16970,FALSE DAWN.,
16971,FALSE DAWN.,"This, if you please, was the cynical Miss Copleigh. Here was I, almost"
16972,FALSE DAWN.,"an utter stranger to her, trying to tell her that Saumarez loved her"
16973,FALSE DAWN.,and she was to come back to hear him say so! I believe I made myself
16974,FALSE DAWN.,"understood, for she gathered the gray together and made him hobble"
16975,FALSE DAWN.,"somehow, and we set off for the tomb, while the storm went thundering"
16976,FALSE DAWN.,down to Umballa and a few big drops of warm rain fell. I found out that
16977,FALSE DAWN.,she had been standing close to Saumarez when he proposed to her sister
16978,FALSE DAWN.,"and had wanted to go home and cry in peace, as an English girl should."
16979,FALSE DAWN.,"She dabbled her eyes with her pocket-handkerchief as we went along, and"
16980,FALSE DAWN.,babbled to me out of sheer lightness of heart and hysteria. That was
16981,FALSE DAWN.,"perfectly unnatural; and yet, it seemed all right at the time and in the"
16982,FALSE DAWN.,"place. All the world was only the two Copleigh girls, Saumarez and I,"
16983,FALSE DAWN.,ringed in with the lightning and the dark; and the guidance of this
16984,FALSE DAWN.,misguided world seemed to lie in my hands.
16985,FALSE DAWN.,
16986,FALSE DAWN.,"When we returned to the tomb in the deep, dead stillness that followed"
16987,FALSE DAWN.,"the storm, the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away. They"
16988,FALSE DAWN.,were waiting for our return. Saumarez most of all.
16989,FALSE DAWN.,
16990,FALSE DAWN.,"His face was white and drawn. As Miss Copleigh and I limped up, he came"
16991,FALSE DAWN.,"forward to meet us, and, when he helped her down from her saddle, he"
16992,FALSE DAWN.,"kissed her before all the picnic. It was like a scene in a theatre, and"
16993,FALSE DAWN.,"the likeness was heightened by all the dust-white, ghostly-looking men"
16994,FALSE DAWN.,"and women under the orange-trees, clapping their hands, as if they"
16995,FALSE DAWN.,were watching a play--at Saumarez's choice. I never knew anything so
16996,FALSE DAWN.,un-English in my life.
16997,FALSE DAWN.,
16998,FALSE DAWN.,"Lastly, Saumarez said we must all go home or the Station would come"
16999,FALSE DAWN.,"out to look for us, and WOULD I be good enough to ride home with Maud"
17000,FALSE DAWN.,"Copleigh? Nothing would give me greater pleasure, I said."
17001,FALSE DAWN.,
17002,FALSE DAWN.,"So, we formed up, six couples in all, and went back two by two; Saumarez"
17003,FALSE DAWN.,"walking at the side of Edith Copleigh, who was riding his horse."
17004,FALSE DAWN.,
17005,FALSE DAWN.,"The air was cleared; and little by little, as the sun rose, I felt we"
17006,FALSE DAWN.,were all dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that
17007,FALSE DAWN.,"the ""Great Pop Picnic"" was a thing altogether apart and out of the"
17008,FALSE DAWN.,world--never to happen again. It had gone with the dust-storm and the
17009,FALSE DAWN.,tingle in the hot air.
17010,FALSE DAWN.,
17011,FALSE DAWN.,"I felt tired and limp, and a good deal ashamed of myself as I went in"
17012,FALSE DAWN.,for a bath and some sleep.
17013,FALSE DAWN.,
17014,FALSE DAWN.,"There is a woman's version of this story, but it will never be written."
17015,FALSE DAWN.,... unless Maud Copleigh cares to try.

17020,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.
17021,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17022,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Thus, for a season, they fought it fair--"
17023,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,She and his cousin May--
17024,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Tactful, talented, debonnaire,"
17025,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Decorous foes were they;
17026,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,But never can battle of man compare
17027,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,With merciless feminine fray.
17028,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,--Two and One.
17029,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17030,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Mrs. Hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex. Here is a story to
17031,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,prove this; and you can believe just as much as ever you please.
17032,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17033,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Pluffles was a subaltern in the ""Unmentionables."" He was callow, even"
17034,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,for a subaltern. He was callow all over--like a canary that had not
17035,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,finished fledging itself. The worst of it was he had three times as much
17036,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,money as was good for him; Pluffles' Papa being a rich man and Pluffles
17037,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,being the only son. Pluffles' Mamma adored him. She was only a little
17038,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,less callow than Pluffles and she believed everything he said.
17039,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17040,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Pluffles' weakness was not believing what people said. He preferred what
17041,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"he called ""trusting to his own judgment."" He had as much judgment as he"
17042,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,had seat or hands; and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or
17043,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,twice. But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at
17044,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Simla--some years ago, when he was four-and-twenty."
17045,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17046,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"He began by trusting to his own judgment, as usual, and the result"
17047,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"was that, after a time, he was bound hand and foot to Mrs. Reiver's"
17048,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,'rickshaw wheels.
17049,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17050,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"There was nothing good about Mrs. Reiver, unless it was her dress."
17051,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17052,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,She was bad from her hair--which started life on a Brittany's girl's
17053,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"head--to her boot-heels, which were two and three-eighth inches high."
17054,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,She was not honestly mischievous like Mrs. Hauksbee; she was wicked in a
17055,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,business-like way.
17056,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17057,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,There was never any scandal--she had not generous impulses enough for
17058,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,that. She was the exception which proved the rule that Anglo-Indian
17059,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,ladies are in every way as nice as their sisters at Home.
17060,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17061,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,She spent her life in proving that rule.
17062,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17063,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Mrs. Hauksbee and she hated each other fervently. They heard far
17064,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,too much to clash; but the things they said of each other were
17065,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,startling--not to say original. Mrs. Hauksbee was honest--honest as her
17066,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"own front teeth--and, but for her love of mischief, would have been"
17067,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,a woman's woman. There was no honesty about Mrs. Reiver; nothing but
17068,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"selfishness. And at the beginning of the season, poor little Pluffles"
17069,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"fell a prey to her. She laid herself out to that end, and who was"
17070,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Pluffles, to resist? He went on trusting to his judgment, and he got"
17071,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,judged.
17072,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17073,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,I have seen Hayes argue with a tough horse--I have seen a tonga-driver
17074,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,coerce a stubborn pony--I have seen a riotous setter broken to gun by a
17075,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"hard keeper--but the breaking-in of Pluffles of the ""Unmentionables"" was"
17076,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"beyond all these. He learned to fetch and carry like a dog, and to"
17077,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"wait like one, too, for a word from Mrs. Reiver. He learned to keep"
17078,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,appointments which Mrs. Reiver had no intention of keeping. He learned
17079,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,to take thankfully dances which Mrs. Reiver had no intention of giving
17080,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,him. He learned to shiver for an hour and a quarter on the windward side
17081,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,of Elysium while Mrs. Reiver was making up her mind to come for a
17082,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"ride. He learned to hunt for a 'rickshaw, in a light dress-suit under"
17083,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"a pelting rain, and to walk by the side of that 'rickshaw when he had"
17084,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,found it. He learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and
17085,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,ordered about like a cook. He learned all this and many other things
17086,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,besides. And he paid for his schooling.
17087,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17088,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Perhaps, in some hazy way, he fancied that it was fine and impressive,"
17089,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"that it gave him a status among men, and was altogether the thing to do."
17090,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,It was nobody's business to warn Pluffles that he was unwise. The pace
17091,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,that season was too good to inquire; and meddling with another man's
17092,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,folly is always thankless work.
17093,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17094,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Pluffles' Colonel should have ordered him back to his regiment when he
17095,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,heard how things were going. But Pluffles had got himself engaged to a
17096,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,girl in England the last time he went home; and if there was one
17097,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"thing more than another which the Colonel detested, it was a married"
17098,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"subaltern. He chuckled when he heard of the education of Pluffles, and"
17099,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"said it was ""good training for the boy."" But it was not good training in"
17100,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"the least. It led him into spending money beyond his means, which were"
17101,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"good: above that, the education spoilt an average boy and made it a"
17102,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"tenth-rate man of an objectionable kind. He wandered into a bad set, and"
17103,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,his little bill at Hamilton's was a thing to wonder at.
17104,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17105,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Then Mrs. Hauksbee rose to the occasion. She played her game alone,"
17106,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,knowing what people would say of her; and she played it for the sake of
17107,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"a girl she had never seen. Pluffles' fiancee was to come out, under the"
17108,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"chaperonage of an aunt, in October, to be married to Pluffles."
17109,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17110,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"At the beginning of August, Mrs. Hauksbee discovered that it was time to"
17111,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,interfere. A man who rides much knows exactly what a horse is going to
17112,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"do next before he does it. In the same way, a woman of Mrs. Hauksbee's"
17113,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,experience knows accurately how a boy will behave under certain
17114,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,circumstances--notably when he is infatuated with one of Mrs. Reiver's
17115,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"stamp. She said that, sooner or later, little Pluffles would break off"
17116,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"that engagement for nothing at all--simply to gratify Mrs. Reiver, who,"
17117,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"in return, would keep him at her feet and in her service just so long as"
17118,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,she found it worth her while.
17119,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17120,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"She said she knew the signs of these things. If she did not, no one else"
17121,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,could.
17122,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17123,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Then she went forth to capture Pluffles under the guns of the enemy;
17124,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,just as Mrs. Cusack-Bremmil carried away Bremmil under Mrs. Hauksbee's
17125,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,eyes.
17126,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17127,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,This particular engagement lasted seven weeks--we called it the Seven
17128,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Weeks' War--and was fought out inch by inch on both sides. A detailed
17129,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"account would fill a book, and would be incomplete then."
17130,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17131,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Any one who knows about these things can fit in the details for himself.
17132,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,It was a superb fight--there will never be another like it as long as
17133,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Jakko stands--and Pluffles was the prize of victory.
17134,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17135,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,People said shameful things about Mrs. Hauksbee. They did not know what
17136,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"she was playing for. Mrs. Reiver fought, partly because Pluffles was"
17137,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"useful to her, but mainly because she hated Mrs. Hauksbee, and the"
17138,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,matter was a trial of strength between them. No one knows what Pluffles
17139,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"thought. He had not many ideas at the best of times, and the few he"
17140,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"possessed made him conceited. Mrs. Hauksbee said:--""The boy must be"
17141,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"caught; and the only way of catching him is by treating him well."""
17142,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17143,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,So she treated him as a man of the world and of experience so long as
17144,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"the issue was doubtful. Little by little, Pluffles fell away from his"
17145,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"old allegiance and came over to the enemy, by whom he was made much of."
17146,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"He was never sent on out-post duty after 'rickshaws any more, nor was"
17147,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"he given dances which never came off, nor were the drains on his"
17148,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,purse continued. Mrs. Hauksbee held him on the snaffle; and after his
17149,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"treatment at Mrs. Reiver's hands, he appreciated the change."
17150,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17151,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Mrs. Reiver had broken him of talking about himself, and made him"
17152,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"talk about her own merits. Mrs. Hauksbee acted otherwise, and won"
17153,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"his confidence, till he mentioned his engagement to the girl at Home,"
17154,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"speaking of it in a high and mighty way as a ""piece of boyish folly."""
17155,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"This was when he was taking tea with her one afternoon, and discoursing"
17156,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,in what he considered a gay and fascinating style.
17157,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17158,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Mrs. Hauksbee had seen an earlier generation of his stamp bud and
17159,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"blossom, and decay into fat Captains and tubby Majors."
17160,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17161,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,At a moderate estimate there were about three and twenty sides to that
17162,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,lady's character. Some men say more. She began to talk to Pluffles after
17163,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"the manner of a mother, and as if there had been three hundred years,"
17164,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"instead of fifteen, between them. She spoke with a sort of throaty"
17165,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"quaver in her voice which had a soothing effect, though what she said"
17166,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"was anything but soothing. She pointed out the exceeding folly, not to"
17167,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"say meanness, of Pluffles' conduct, and the smallness of his views. Then"
17168,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"he stammered something about ""trusting to his own judgment as a man of"
17169,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"the world;"" and this paved the way for what she wanted to say next. It"
17170,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,would have withered up Pluffles had it come from any other woman; but
17171,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"in the soft cooing style in which Mrs. Hauksbee put it, it only made"
17172,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,him feel limp and repentant--as if he had been in some superior kind of
17173,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"church. Little by little, very softly and pleasantly, she began taking"
17174,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"the conceit out of Pluffles, as you take the ribs out of an umbrella"
17175,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,before re-covering it. She told him what she thought of him and his
17176,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,judgment and his knowledge of the world; and how his performances had
17177,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,made him ridiculous to other people; and how it was his intention to
17178,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,make love to herself if she gave him the chance. Then she said
17179,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,that marriage would be the making of him; and drew a pretty little
17180,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,picture--all rose and opal--of the Mrs. Pluffles of the future going
17181,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"through life relying on the ""judgment"" and ""knowledge of the world"" of"
17182,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,a husband who had nothing to reproach himself with. How she reconciled
17183,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,these two statements she alone knew. But they did not strike Pluffles as
17184,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,conflicting.
17185,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17186,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Hers was a perfect little homily--much better than any clergyman could
17187,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,have given--and it ended with touching allusions to Pluffles' Mamma and
17188,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Papa, and the wisdom of taking his bride Home."
17189,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17190,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Then she sent Pluffles out for a walk, to think over what she had said."
17191,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Pluffles left, blowing his nose very hard and holding himself very"
17192,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,straight. Mrs. Hauksbee laughed.
17193,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17194,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,What Pluffles had intended to do in the matter of the engagement only
17195,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Mrs. Reiver knew, and she kept her own counsel to her death. She would"
17196,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"have liked it spoiled as a compliment, I fancy."
17197,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17198,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Pluffles enjoyed many talks with Mrs. Hauksbee during the next few days.
17199,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"They were all to the same end, and they helped Pluffles in the path of"
17200,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Virtue.
17201,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17202,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Mrs. Hauksbee wanted to keep him under her wing to the last.
17203,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17204,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Therefore she discountenanced his going down to Bombay to get married.
17205,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"""Goodness only knows what might happen by the way!"" she said. ""Pluffles"
17206,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"is cursed with the curse of Reuben, and India is no fit place for him!"""
17207,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17208,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"In the end, the fiancee arrived with her aunt; and Pluffles, having"
17209,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,reduced his affairs to some sort of order--here again Mrs. Hauksbee
17210,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,helped him--was married.
17211,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17212,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Mrs. Hauksbee gave a sigh of relief when both the ""I wills"" had been"
17213,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"said, and went her way."
17214,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17215,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Pluffles took her advice about going Home. He left the Service, and is"
17216,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,now raising speckled cattle inside green painted fences somewhere at
17217,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,Home. I believe he does this very judiciously. He would have come to
17218,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,extreme grief out here.
17219,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,
17220,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,For these reasons if any one says anything more than usually nasty about
17221,THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES.,"Mrs. Hauksbee, tell him the story of the Rescue of Pluffles."

17239,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17240,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Once upon a time there lived at Simla a very pretty girl, the daughter"
17241,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"of a poor but honest District and Sessions Judge. She was a good girl,"
17242,CUPID'S ARROWS.,but could not help knowing her power and using it.
17243,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17244,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Her Mamma was very anxious about her daughter's future, as all good"
17245,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Mammas should be.
17246,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17247,CUPID'S ARROWS.,When a man is a Commissioner and a bachelor and has the right of wearing
17248,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"open-work jam-tart jewels in gold and enamel on his clothes, and of"
17249,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"going through a door before every one except a Member of Council, a"
17250,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Lieutenant-Governor, or a Viceroy, he is worth marrying. At least, that"
17251,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"is what ladies say. There was a Commissioner in Simla, in those days,"
17252,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"who was, and wore, and did, all I have said. He was a plain man--an ugly"
17253,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"man--the ugliest man in Asia, with two exceptions. His was a face to"
17254,CUPID'S ARROWS.,dream about and try to carve on a pipe-head afterwards. His name was
17255,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Saggott--Barr-Saggott--Anthony Barr-Saggott and six letters to follow.
17256,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17257,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Departmentally, he was one of the best men the Government of India"
17258,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"owned. Socially, he was like a blandishing gorilla."
17259,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17260,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"When he turned his attentions to Miss Beighton, I believe that Mrs."
17261,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17262,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Beighton wept with delight at the reward Providence had sent her in her
17263,CUPID'S ARROWS.,old age.
17264,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17265,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Mr. Beighton held his tongue. He was an easy-going man.
17266,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17267,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Now a Commissioner is very rich. His pay is beyond the dreams of
17268,CUPID'S ARROWS.,avarice--is so enormous that he can afford to save and scrape in a way
17269,CUPID'S ARROWS.,that would almost discredit a Member of Council. Most Commissioners
17270,CUPID'S ARROWS.,are mean; but Barr-Saggott was an exception. He entertained royally; he
17271,CUPID'S ARROWS.,horsed himself well; he gave dances; he was a power in the land; and he
17272,CUPID'S ARROWS.,behaved as such.
17273,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17274,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Consider that everything I am writing of took place in an almost
17275,CUPID'S ARROWS.,pre-historic era in the history of British India. Some folk may remember
17276,CUPID'S ARROWS.,the years before lawn-tennis was born when we all played croquet. There
17277,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"were seasons before that, if you will believe me, when even croquet"
17278,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"had not been invented, and archery--which was revived in England in"
17279,CUPID'S ARROWS.,1844--was as great a pest as lawn-tennis is now. People talked learnedly
17280,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"about ""holding"" and ""loosing,"" ""steles,"" ""reflexed bows,"" ""56-pound"
17281,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"bows,"" ""backed"" or ""self-yew bows,"" as we talk about ""rallies,"""
17282,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"""volleys,"" ""smashes,"" ""returns,"" and ""16-ounce rackets."""
17283,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17284,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Miss Beighton shot divinely over ladies' distance--60 yards, that"
17285,CUPID'S ARROWS.,is--and was acknowledged the best lady archer in Simla. Men called her
17286,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"""Diana of Tara-Devi."""
17287,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17288,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Barr-Saggott paid her great attention; and, as I have said, the heart of"
17289,CUPID'S ARROWS.,her mother was uplifted in consequence. Kitty Beighton took matters more
17290,CUPID'S ARROWS.,calmly. It was pleasant to be singled out by a Commissioner with letters
17291,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"after his name, and to fill the hearts of other girls with bad feelings."
17292,CUPID'S ARROWS.,But there was no denying the fact that Barr-Saggott was phenomenally
17293,CUPID'S ARROWS.,ugly; and all his attempts to adorn himself only made him more
17294,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"grotesque. He was not christened ""The Langur""--which means gray ape--for"
17295,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"nothing. It was pleasant, Kitty thought, to have him at her feet, but"
17296,CUPID'S ARROWS.,it was better to escape from him and ride with the graceless Cubbon--the
17297,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"man in a Dragoon Regiment at Umballa--the boy with a handsome face, and"
17298,CUPID'S ARROWS.,no prospects. Kitty liked Cubbon more than a little. He never pretended
17299,CUPID'S ARROWS.,for a moment the he was anything less than head over heels in love with
17300,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"her; for he was an honest boy. So Kitty fled, now and again, from the"
17301,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"stately wooings of Barr-Saggott to the company of young Cubbon, and"
17302,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"was scolded by her Mamma in consequence. ""But, Mother,"" she said, ""Mr."
17303,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Saggott is such--such a--is so FEARFULLY ugly, you know!"""
17304,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17305,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"""My dear,"" said Mrs. Beighton, piously, ""we cannot be other than an"
17306,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"all-ruling Providence has made us. Besides, you will take precedence of"
17307,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"your own Mother, you know! Think of that and be reasonable."""
17308,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17309,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Then Kitty put up her little chin and said irreverent things about
17310,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"precedence, and Commissioners, and matrimony. Mr. Beighton rubbed the"
17311,CUPID'S ARROWS.,top of his head; for he was an easy-going man.
17312,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17313,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Late in the season, when he judged that the time was ripe, Barr-Saggott"
17314,CUPID'S ARROWS.,developed a plan which did great credit to his administrative powers.
17315,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"He arranged an archery tournament for ladies, with a most sumptuous"
17316,CUPID'S ARROWS.,diamond-studded bracelet as prize.
17317,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17318,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"He drew up his terms skilfully, and every one saw that the bracelet was"
17319,CUPID'S ARROWS.,a gift to Miss Beighton; the acceptance carrying with it the hand and
17320,CUPID'S ARROWS.,the heart of Commissioner Barr-Saggott. The terms were a St. Leonard's
17321,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Round--thirty-six shots at sixty yards--under the rules of the Simla
17322,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Toxophilite Society.
17323,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17324,CUPID'S ARROWS.,All Simla was invited. There were beautifully arranged tea-tables under
17325,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"the deodars at Annandale, where the Grand Stand is now; and, alone in"
17326,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"its glory, winking in the sun, sat the diamond bracelet in a blue velvet"
17327,CUPID'S ARROWS.,case. Miss Beighton was anxious--almost too anxious to compete. On the
17328,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"appointed afternoon, all Simla rode down to Annandale to witness the"
17329,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Judgment of Paris turned upside down.
17330,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17331,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Kitty rode with young Cubbon, and it was easy to see that the boy"
17332,CUPID'S ARROWS.,was troubled in his mind. He must be held innocent of everything that
17333,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"followed. Kitty was pale and nervous, and looked long at the bracelet."
17334,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Barr-Saggott was gorgeously dressed, even more nervous than Kitty, and"
17335,CUPID'S ARROWS.,more hideous than ever.
17336,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17337,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Mrs. Beighton smiled condescendingly, as befitted the mother of a"
17338,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"potential Commissioneress, and the shooting began; all the world"
17339,CUPID'S ARROWS.,standing in a semicircle as the ladies came out one after the other.
17340,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17341,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Nothing is so tedious as an archery competition. They shot, and they"
17342,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"shot, and they kept on shooting, till the sun left the valley, and"
17343,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"little breezes got up in the deodars, and people waited for Miss"
17344,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Beighton to shoot and win. Cubbon was at one horn of the semicircle
17345,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"round the shooters, and Barr-Saggott at the other. Miss Beighton was"
17346,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"last on the list. The scoring had been weak, and the bracelet, PLUS"
17347,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Commissioner Barr-Saggott, was hers to a certainty."
17348,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17349,CUPID'S ARROWS.,The Commissioner strung her bow with his own sacred hands. She stepped
17350,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"forward, looked at the bracelet, and her first arrow went true to a"
17351,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"hair--full into the heart of the ""gold""--counting nine points."
17352,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17353,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Young Cubbon on the left turned white, and his Devil prompted"
17354,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Barr-Saggott to smile. Now horses used to shy when Barr-Saggott smiled.
17355,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17356,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Kitty saw that smile. She looked to her left-front, gave an almost"
17357,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"imperceptible nod to Cubbon, and went on shooting."
17358,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17359,CUPID'S ARROWS.,I wish I could describe the scene that followed. It was out of the
17360,CUPID'S ARROWS.,ordinary and most improper. Miss Kitty fitted her arrows with immense
17361,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"deliberation, so that every one might see what she was doing. She was"
17362,CUPID'S ARROWS.,a perfect shot; and her 46-pound bow suited her to a nicety. She pinned
17363,CUPID'S ARROWS.,the wooden legs of the target with great care four successive times. She
17364,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"pinned the wooden top of the target once, and all the ladies looked at"
17365,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"each other. Then she began some fancy shooting at the white, which,"
17366,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"if you hit it, counts exactly one point. She put five arrows into the"
17367,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"white. It was wonderful archery; but, seeing that her business was to"
17368,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"make ""golds"" and win the bracelet, Barr-Saggott turned a delicate green"
17369,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"like young water-grass. Next, she shot over the target twice, then wide"
17370,CUPID'S ARROWS.,to the left twice--always with the same deliberation--while a chilly
17371,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"hush fell over the company, and Mrs. Beighton took out her handkerchief."
17372,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Then Kitty shot at the ground in front of the target, and split several"
17373,CUPID'S ARROWS.,arrows. Then she made a red--or seven points--just to show what she
17374,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"could do if she liked, and finished up her amazing performance with some"
17375,CUPID'S ARROWS.,more fancy shooting at the target-supports. Here is her score as it was
17376,CUPID'S ARROWS.,picked off:--
17377,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17378,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Gold. Red. Blue. Black. White. Total Hits.  Total Score Miss Beighton
17379,CUPID'S ARROWS.,1      1    0     0      5        7                  21
17380,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17381,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Barr-Saggott looked as if the last few arrowheads had been driven into
17382,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"his legs instead of the target's, and the deep stillness was broken by"
17383,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"a little snubby, mottled, half-grown girl saying in a shrill voice of"
17384,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"triumph: ""Then I'VE won!"""
17385,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17386,CUPID'S ARROWS.,Mrs. Beighton did her best to bear up; but she wept in the presence of
17387,CUPID'S ARROWS.,the people. No training could help her through such a disappointment.
17388,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"Kitty unstrung her bow with a vicious jerk, and went back to her place,"
17389,CUPID'S ARROWS.,while Barr-Saggott was trying to pretend that he enjoyed snapping
17390,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"the bracelet on the snubby girl's raw, red wrist. It was an awkward"
17391,CUPID'S ARROWS.,scene--most awkward. Every one tried to depart in a body and leave Kitty
17392,CUPID'S ARROWS.,to the mercy of her Mamma.
17393,CUPID'S ARROWS.,
17394,CUPID'S ARROWS.,"But Cubbon took her away instead, and--the rest isn't worth printing."

17419,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"in still fiercer abasement and humility, half heathenish customs and"
17420,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"strange, unaccountable impulses to crime. One of these days, this"
17421,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"people--understand they are far lower than the class whence Derozio, the"
17422,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"man who imitated Byron, sprung--will turn out a writer or a poet; and"
17423,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"then we shall know how they live and what they feel. In the meantime,"
17424,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,any stories about them cannot be absolutely correct in fact or
17425,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,inference.
17426,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17427,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Miss Vezzis came from across the Borderline to look after some children
17428,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,who belonged to a lady until a regularly ordained nurse could come out.
17429,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"The lady said Miss Vezzis was a bad, dirty nurse and inattentive. It"
17430,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,never struck her that Miss Vezzis had her own life to lead and her own
17431,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"affairs to worry over, and that these affairs were the most important"
17432,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,things in the world to Miss Vezzis.
17433,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17434,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Very few mistresses admit this sort of reasoning. Miss Vezzis was as
17435,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"black as a boot, and to our standard of taste, hideously ugly."
17436,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17437,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,She wore cotton-print gowns and bulged shoes; and when she lost her
17438,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"temper with the children, she abused them in the language of the"
17439,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Borderline--which is part English, part Portuguese, and part Native."
17440,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"She was not attractive; but she had her pride, and she preferred being"
17441,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"called ""Miss Vezzis."""
17442,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17443,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Every Sunday she dressed herself wonderfully and went to see her
17444,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Mamma, who lived, for the most part, on an old cane chair in a greasy"
17445,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,tussur-silk dressing-gown and a big rabbit-warren of a house full of
17446,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Vezzises, Pereiras, Ribieras, Lisboas and Gansalveses, and a floating"
17447,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"population of loafers; besides fragments of the day's bazar, garlic,"
17448,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"stale incense, clothes thrown on the floor, petticoats hung on strings"
17449,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"for screens, old bottles, pewter crucifixes, dried immortelles, pariah"
17450,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"puppies, plaster images of the Virgin, and hats without crowns. Miss"
17451,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Vezzis drew twenty rupees a month for acting as nurse, and she"
17452,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,squabbled weekly with her Mamma as to the percentage to be given towards
17453,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,housekeeping.
17454,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17455,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"When the quarrel was over, Michele D'Cruze used to shamble across the"
17456,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,low mud wall of the compound and make love to Miss Vezzis after the
17457,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"fashion of the Borderline, which is hedged about with much ceremony."
17458,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Michele was a poor, sickly weed and very black; but he had his pride."
17459,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,He would not be seen smoking a huqa for anything; and he looked down on
17460,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,natives as only a man with seven-eighths native blood in his veins can.
17461,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,The Vezzis Family had their pride too. They traced their descent from
17462,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,a mythical plate-layer who had worked on the Sone Bridge when railways
17463,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"were new in India, and they valued their English origin. Michele was"
17464,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,a Telegraph Signaller on Rs. 35 a month. The fact that he was in
17465,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Government employ made Mrs. Vezzis lenient to the shortcomings of his
17466,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,ancestors.
17467,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17468,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,There was a compromising legend--Dom Anna the tailor brought it from
17469,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Poonani--that a black Jew of Cochin had once married into the D'Cruze
17470,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,family; while it was an open secret that an uncle of Mrs. D'Cruze was at
17471,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"that very time doing menial work, connected with cooking, for a Club in"
17472,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Southern India! He sent Mrs D'Cruze seven rupees eight annas a month;
17473,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,but she felt the disgrace to the family very keenly all the same.
17474,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17475,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"However, in the course of a few Sundays, Mrs. Vezzis brought herself"
17476,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,to overlook these blemishes and gave her consent to the marriage of her
17477,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"daughter with Michele, on condition that Michele should have at least"
17478,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,fifty rupees a month to start married life upon. This wonderful prudence
17479,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,must have been a lingering touch of the mythical plate-layer's Yorkshire
17480,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,blood; for across the Borderline people take a pride in marrying when
17481,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,they please--not when they can.
17482,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17483,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Having regard to his departmental prospects, Miss Vezzis might as well"
17484,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,have asked Michele to go away and come back with the Moon in his pocket.
17485,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"But Michele was deeply in love with Miss Vezzis, and that helped him to"
17486,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"endure. He accompanied Miss Vezzis to Mass one Sunday, and after Mass,"
17487,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"walking home through the hot stale dust with her hand in his, he swore"
17488,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"by several Saints, whose names would not interest you, never to forget"
17489,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Miss Vezzis; and she swore by her Honor and the Saints--the oath runs
17490,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"rather curiously; ""In nomine Sanctissimae--"" (whatever the name of the"
17491,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"she-Saint is) and so forth, ending with a kiss on the forehead, a kiss"
17492,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"on the left cheek, and a kiss on the mouth--never to forget Michele."
17493,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17494,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Next week Michele was transferred, and Miss Vezzis dropped tears"
17495,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"upon the window-sash of the ""Intermediate"" compartment as he left the"
17496,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Station.
17497,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17498,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,If you look at the telegraph-map of India you will see a long line
17499,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,skirting the coast from Backergunge to Madras. Michele was ordered to
17500,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Tibasu, a little Sub-office one-third down this line, to send messages"
17501,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"on from Berhampur to Chicacola, and to think of Miss Vezzis and his"
17502,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,chances of getting fifty rupees a month out of office hours. He had the
17503,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,noise of the Bay of Bengal and a Bengali Babu for company; nothing more.
17504,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"He sent foolish letters, with crosses tucked inside the flaps of the"
17505,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"envelopes, to Miss Vezzis."
17506,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17507,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,When he had been at Tibasu for nearly three weeks his chance came.
17508,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17509,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Never forget that unless the outward and visible signs of Our
17510,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Authority are always before a native he is as incapable as a child of
17511,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"understanding what authority means, or where is the danger of disobeying"
17512,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,it. Tibasu was a forgotten little place with a few Orissa Mohamedans
17513,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"in it. These, hearing nothing of the Collector-Sahib for some time,"
17514,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"and heartily despising the Hindu Sub-Judge, arranged to start a little"
17515,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Mohurrum riot of their own. But the Hindus turned out and broke their
17516,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"heads; when, finding lawlessness pleasant, Hindus and Mahomedans"
17517,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,together raised an aimless sort of Donnybrook just to see how far they
17518,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"could go. They looted each other's shops, and paid off private grudges"
17519,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"in the regular way. It was a nasty little riot, but not worth putting in"
17520,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,the newspapers.
17521,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17522,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Michele was working in his office when he heard the sound that a man
17523,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"never forgets all his life--the ""ah-yah"" of an angry crowd."
17524,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17525,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"[When that sound drops about three tones, and changes to a thick,"
17526,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"droning ut, the man who hears it had better go away if he is alone.] The"
17527,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,Native Police Inspector ran in and told Michele that the town was in an
17528,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,uproar and coming to wreck the Telegraph Office.
17529,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17530,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,The Babu put on his cap and quietly dropped out of the window; while
17531,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"the Police Inspector, afraid, but obeying the old race-instinct"
17532,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"which recognizes a drop of White blood as far as it can be diluted,"
17533,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"said:--""What orders does the Sahib give?"""
17534,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17535,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"The ""Sahib"" decided Michele. Though horribly frightened, he felt that,"
17536,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"for the hour, he, the man with the Cochin Jew and the menial uncle in"
17537,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"his pedigree, was the only representative of English authority in the"
17538,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"place. Then he thought of Miss Vezzis and the fifty rupees, and took the"
17539,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"situation on himself. There were seven native policemen in Tibasu, and"
17540,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,four crazy smooth-bore muskets among them. All the men were gray with
17541,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"fear, but not beyond leading. Michele dropped the key of the telegraph"
17542,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"instrument, and went out, at the head of his army, to meet the mob. As"
17543,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"the shouting crew came round a corner of the road, he dropped and fired;"
17544,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,the men behind him loosing instinctively at the same time.
17545,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17546,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,The whole crowd--curs to the backbone--yelled and ran; leaving one man
17547,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"dead, and another dying in the road. Michele was sweating with fear, but"
17548,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"he kept his weakness under, and went down into the town, past the house"
17549,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,where the Sub-Judge had barricaded himself. The streets were empty.
17550,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Tibasu was more frightened than Michele, for the mob had been taken at"
17551,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,the right time.
17552,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17553,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Michele returned to the Telegraph-Office, and sent a message to"
17554,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Chicacola asking for help. Before an answer came, he received a"
17555,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"deputation of the elders of Tibasu, telling him that the Sub-Judge said"
17556,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"his actions generally were ""unconstitional,"" and trying to bully him."
17557,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"But the heart of Michele D'Cruze was big and white in his breast,"
17558,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"because of his love for Miss Vezzis, the nurse-girl, and because he had"
17559,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,tasted for the first time Responsibility and Success. Those two make
17560,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"an intoxicating drink, and have ruined more men than ever has Whiskey."
17561,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Michele answered that the Sub-Judge might say what he pleased, but,"
17562,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"until the Assistant Collector came, the Telegraph Signaller was the"
17563,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Government of India in Tibasu, and the elders of the town would be held"
17564,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,accountable for further rioting. Then they bowed their heads and said:
17565,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"""Show mercy!"" or words to that effect, and went back in great fear; each"
17566,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,accusing the other of having begun the rioting.
17567,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17568,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Early in the dawn, after a night's patrol with his seven policemen,"
17569,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Michele went down the road, musket in hand, to meet the Assistant"
17570,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Collector, who had ridden in to quell Tibasu. But, in the presence of"
17571,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"this young Englishman, Michele felt himself slipping back more and more"
17572,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"into the native, and the tale of the Tibasu Riots ended, with the strain"
17573,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"on the teller, in an hysterical outburst of tears, bred by sorrow that"
17574,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"he had killed a man, shame that he could not feel as uplifted as he had"
17575,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"felt through the night, and childish anger that his tongue could not"
17576,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,do justice to his great deeds. It was the White drop in Michele's veins
17577,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"dying out, though he did not know it."
17578,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17579,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"But the Englishman understood; and, after he had schooled those men"
17580,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"of Tibasu, and had conferred with the Sub-Judge till that excellent"
17581,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"official turned green, he found time to draught an official letter"
17582,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,describing the conduct of Michele. Which letter filtered through the
17583,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Proper Channels, and ended in the transfer of Michele up-country once"
17584,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"more, on the Imperial salary of sixty-six rupees a month."
17585,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17586,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,So he and Miss Vezzis were married with great state and ancientry; and
17587,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,now there are several little D'Cruzes sprawling about the verandahs of
17588,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,the Central Telegraph Office.
17589,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17590,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"But, if the whole revenue of the Department he serves were to be his"
17591,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"reward Michele could never, never repeat what he did at Tibasu for the"
17592,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,sake of Miss Vezzis the nurse-girl.
17593,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17594,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"Which proves that, when a man does good work out of all proportion to"
17595,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,"his pay, in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the"
17596,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,virtue.
17597,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17598,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,The two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke.
17599,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17600,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17601,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17602,HIS CHANCE IN LIFE.,
17603,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.
17604,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17605,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,What is in the Brahmin's books that is in the Brahmin's heart.
17606,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Neither you nor I knew there was so much evil in the world.
17607,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,--Hindu Proverb.
17608,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17609,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"This began in a practical joke; but it has gone far enough now, and is"
17610,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,getting serious.
17611,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17612,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Platte, the Subaltern, being poor, had a Waterbury watch and a plain"
17613,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,leather guard.
17614,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17615,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"The Colonel had a Waterbury watch also, and for guard, the lip-strap of"
17616,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,a curb-chain. Lip-straps make the best watch guards.
17617,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17618,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,They are strong and short. Between a lip-strap and an ordinary leather
17619,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,guard there is no great difference; between one Waterbury watch
17620,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,and another there is none at all. Every one in the station knew the
17621,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Colonel's lip-strap. He was not a horsey man, but he liked people to"
17622,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,believe he had been one once; and he wove fantastic stories of the
17623,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,hunting-bridle to which this particular lip-strap had belonged.
17624,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Otherwise he was painfully religious.
17625,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17626,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Platte and the Colonel were dressing at the Club--both late for their
17627,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"engagements, and both in a hurry. That was Kismet. The two watches"
17628,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,were on a shelf below the looking-glass--guards hanging down. That was
17629,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"carelessness. Platte changed first, snatched a watch, looked in the"
17630,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"glass, settled his tie, and ran. Forty seconds later, the Colonel did"
17631,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,exactly the same thing; each man taking the other's watch.
17632,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17633,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,You may have noticed that many religious people are deeply suspicious.
17634,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"They seem--for purely religious purposes, of course--to know more about"
17635,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,iniquity than the Unregenerate. Perhaps they were specially bad before
17636,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"they became converted! At any rate, in the imputation of things evil,"
17637,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"and in putting the worst construction on things innocent, a certain type"
17638,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,of good people may be trusted to surpass all others. The Colonel and
17639,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,his Wife were of that type. But the Colonel's Wife was the worst. She
17640,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"manufactured the Station scandal, and--TALKED TO HER AYAH! Nothing"
17641,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,more need be said. The Colonel's Wife broke up the Laplaces's home. The
17642,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Colonel's Wife stopped the Ferris-Haughtrey engagement. The Colonel's
17643,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Wife induced young Buxton to keep his wife down in the Plains through
17644,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,the first year of the marriage. Whereby little Mrs.
17645,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17646,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Buxton died, and the baby with her. These things will be remembered"
17647,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,against the Colonel's Wife so long as there is a regiment in the
17648,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,country.
17649,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17650,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,But to come back to the Colonel and Platte. They went their several
17651,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"ways from the dressing-room. The Colonel dined with two Chaplains, while"
17652,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Platte went to a bachelor-party, and whist to follow."
17653,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17654,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Mark how things happen! If Platte's sais had put the new saddle-pad on
17655,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"the mare, the butts of the terrets would not have worked through the"
17656,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"worn leather, and the old pad into the mare's withers, when she was"
17657,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"coming home at two o'clock in the morning. She would not have reared,"
17658,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"bolted, fallen into a ditch, upset the cart, and sent Platte flying over"
17659,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,an aloe-hedge on to Mrs. Larkyn's well-kept lawn; and this tale would
17660,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"never have been written. But the mare did all these things, and while"
17661,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Platte was rolling over and over on the turf, like a shot rabbit, the"
17662,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,watch and guard flew from his waistcoat--as an Infantry Major's sword
17663,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,hops out of the scabbard when they are firing a feu de joie--and rolled
17664,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"and rolled in the moonlight, till it stopped under a window."
17665,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17666,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Platte stuffed his handkerchief under the pad, put the cart straight,"
17667,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,and went home.
17668,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17669,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Mark again how Kismet works! This would not happen once in a hundred
17670,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"years. Towards the end of his dinner with the two Chaplains, the Colonel"
17671,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,let out his waistcoat and leaned over the table to look at some Mission
17672,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Reports. The bar of the watch-guard worked through the buttonhole, and"
17673,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,the watch--Platte's watch--slid quietly on to the carpet. Where the
17674,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,bearer found it next morning and kept it.
17675,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17676,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Then the Colonel went home to the wife of his bosom; but the driver of
17677,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,the carriage was drunk and lost his way. So the Colonel returned at an
17678,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,unseemly hour and his excuses were not accepted. If the Colonel's Wife
17679,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"had been an ordinary ""vessel of wrath appointed for destruction,"" she"
17680,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"would have known that when a man stays away on purpose, his excuse"
17681,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,is always sound and original. The very baldness of the Colonel's
17682,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,explanation proved its truth.
17683,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17684,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,See once more the workings of Kismet! The Colonel's watch which came
17685,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"with Platte hurriedly on to Mrs. Larkyn's lawn, chose to stop just under"
17686,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Mrs. Larkyn's window, where she saw it early in the morning, recognized"
17687,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"it, and picked it up. She had heard the crash of Platte's cart at two"
17688,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"o'clock that morning, and his voice calling the mare names. She knew"
17689,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Platte and liked him. That day she showed him the watch and heard his
17690,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"story. He put his head on one side, winked and said:--""How disgusting!"
17691,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Shocking old man! with his religious training, too! I should send the"
17692,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"watch to the Colonel's Wife and ask for explanations."""
17693,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17694,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Mrs. Larkyn thought for a minute of the Laplaces--whom she had known
17695,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"when Laplace and his wife believed in each other--and answered:--""I will"
17696,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"send it. I think it will do her good. But remember, we must NEVER tell"
17697,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"her the truth."""
17698,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17699,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Platte guessed that his own watch was in the Colonel's possession, and"
17700,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,thought that the return of the lip-strapped Waterbury with a soothing
17701,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"note from Mrs. Larkyn, would merely create a small trouble for a few"
17702,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,minutes. Mrs. Larkyn knew better. She knew that any poison dropped would
17703,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,find good holding-ground in the heart of the Colonel's Wife.
17704,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17705,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"The packet, and a note containing a few remarks on the Colonel's"
17706,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"calling-hours, were sent over to the Colonel's Wife, who wept in her own"
17707,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,room and took counsel with herself.
17708,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17709,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,If there was one woman under Heaven whom the Colonel's Wife hated with
17710,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"holy fervor, it was Mrs. Larkyn. Mrs. Larkyn was a frivolous lady,"
17711,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"and called the Colonel's Wife ""old cat."" The Colonel's Wife said that"
17712,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,somebody in Revelations was remarkably like Mrs. Larkyn.
17713,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17714,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,She mentioned other Scripture people as well. From the Old Testament.
17715,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,[But the Colonel's Wife was the only person who cared or dared to say
17716,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"anything against Mrs. Larkyn. Every one else accepted her as an amusing,"
17717,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"honest little body.] Wherefore, to believe that her husband had been"

17719,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"with the fact of his late arrival on the previous night, was....."
17720,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17721,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,At this point she rose up and sought her husband. He denied everything
17722,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"except the ownership of the watch. She besought him, for his Soul's"
17723,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"sake, to speak the truth. He denied afresh, with two bad words. Then a"
17724,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"stony silence held the Colonel's Wife, while a man could draw his breath"
17725,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,five times.
17726,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17727,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,The speech that followed is no affair of mine or yours. It was made up
17728,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,of wifely and womanly jealousy; knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks;
17729,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,deep mistrust born of the text that says even little babies' hearts
17730,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"are as bad as they make them; rancorous hatred of Mrs. Larkyn, and the"
17731,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,tenets of the creed of the Colonel's Wife's upbringing.
17732,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17733,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Over and above all, was the damning lip-strapped Waterbury, ticking away"
17734,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"in the palm of her shaking, withered hand. At that hour, I think, the"
17735,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Colonel's Wife realized a little of the restless suspicions she had
17736,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"injected into old Laplace's mind, a little of poor Miss Haughtrey's"
17737,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"misery, and some of the canker that ate into Buxton's heart as he"
17738,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,watched his wife dying before his eyes. The Colonel stammered and tried
17739,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,to explain. Then he remembered that his watch had disappeared; and the
17740,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,mystery grew greater. The Colonel's Wife talked and prayed by turns
17741,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"till she was tired, and went away to devise means for ""chastening the"
17742,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"stubborn heart of her husband."" Which translated, means, in our slang,"
17743,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"""tail-twisting."""
17744,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17745,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"You see, being deeply impressed with the doctrine of Original Sin, she"
17746,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"could not believe in the face of appearances. She knew too much, and"
17747,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,jumped to the wildest conclusions.
17748,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17749,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"But it was good for her. It spoilt her life, as she had spoilt the life"
17750,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"of the Laplaces. She had lost her faith in the Colonel, and--here the"
17751,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"creed suspicion came in--he might, she argued, have erred many times,"
17752,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"before a merciful Providence, at the hands of so unworthy an instrument"
17753,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"as Mrs. Larkyn, had established his guilt."
17754,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17755,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"He was a bad, wicked, gray-haired profligate. This may sound too sudden"
17756,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"a revulsion for a long-wedded wife; but it is a venerable fact that, if"
17757,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"a man or woman makes a practice of, and takes a delight in, believing"
17758,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"and spreading evil of people indifferent to him or her, he or she will"
17759,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"end in believing evil of folk very near and dear. You may think, also,"
17760,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,that the mere incident of the watch was too small and trivial to raise
17761,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"this misunderstanding. It is another aged fact that, in life as well as"
17762,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"racing, all the worst accidents happen at little ditches and cut-down"
17763,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"fences. In the same way, you sometimes see a woman who would have made a"
17764,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Joan of Arc in another century and climate, threshing herself to pieces"
17765,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,over all the mean worry of housekeeping. But that is another story.
17766,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17767,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Her belief only made the Colonel's Wife more wretched, because it"
17768,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,insisted so strongly on the villainy of men. Remembering what she had
17769,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"done, it was pleasant to watch her unhappiness, and the penny-farthing"
17770,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,attempts she made to hide it from the Station. But the Station knew and
17771,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"laughed heartlessly; for they had heard the story of the watch, with"
17772,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"much dramatic gesture, from Mrs. Larkyn's lips."
17773,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17774,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Once or twice Platte said to Mrs. Larkyn, seeing that the Colonel had"
17775,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"not cleared himself:--""This thing has gone far enough. I move we tell"
17776,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"the Colonel's Wife how it happened."" Mrs. Larkyn shut her lips and shook"
17777,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"her head, and vowed that the Colonel's Wife must bear her punishment"
17778,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"as best she could. Now Mrs. Larkyn was a frivolous woman, in whom none"
17779,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"would have suspected deep hate. So Platte took no action, and came to"
17780,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"believe gradually, from the Colonel's silence, that the Colonel must"
17781,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"have ""run off the line"" somewhere that night, and, therefore, preferred"
17782,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,to stand sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other people's
17783,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,compounds out of calling hours. Platte forgot about the watch business
17784,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"after a while, and moved down-country with his regiment. Mrs. Larkyn"
17785,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,went home when her husband's tour of Indian service expired. She never
17786,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,forgot.
17787,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17788,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,But Platte was quite right when he said that the joke had gone too far.
17789,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,The mistrust and the tragedy of it--which we outsiders cannot see and
17790,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"do not believe in--are killing the Colonel's Wife, and are making the"
17791,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"Colonel wretched. If either of them read this story, they can depend"
17792,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"upon its being a fairly true account of the case, and can ""kiss and make"
17793,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,"friends."""
17794,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,
17795,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Shakespeare alludes to the pleasure of watching an Engineer being
17796,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,shelled by his own Battery. Now this shows that poets should not write
17797,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,about what they do not understand. Any one could have told him that
17798,WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.,Sappers and Gunners are perfectly different branches of the Service.

17813,THE OTHER MAN.,"Far back in the ""seventies,"" before they had built any Public Offices at"
17814,THE OTHER MAN.,"Simla, and the broad road round Jakko lived in a pigeon-hole in the P."
17815,THE OTHER MAN.,"W. D. hovels, her parents made Miss Gaurey marry Colonel Schreiderling."
17816,THE OTHER MAN.,"He could not have been MUCH more than thirty-five years her senior; and,"
17817,THE OTHER MAN.,"as he lived on two hundred rupees a month and had money of his own,"
17818,THE OTHER MAN.,"he was well off. He belonged to good people, and suffered in the cold"
17819,THE OTHER MAN.,weather from lung complaints. In the hot weather he dangled on the brink
17820,THE OTHER MAN.,of heat-apoplexy; but it never quite killed him.
17821,THE OTHER MAN.,
17822,THE OTHER MAN.,"Understand, I do not blame Schreiderling. He was a good husband"
17823,THE OTHER MAN.,"according to his lights, and his temper only failed him when he was"
17824,THE OTHER MAN.,being nursed. Which was some seventeen days in each month. He was almost
17825,THE OTHER MAN.,"generous to his wife about money matters, and that, for him, was a"
17826,THE OTHER MAN.,concession. Still Mrs. Schreiderling was not happy. They married her
17827,THE OTHER MAN.,when she was this side of twenty and had given all her poor little heart
17828,THE OTHER MAN.,"to another man. I have forgotten his name, but we will call him the"
17829,THE OTHER MAN.,Other Man. He had no money and no prospects.
17830,THE OTHER MAN.,
17831,THE OTHER MAN.,He was not even good-looking; and I think he was in the Commissariat or
17832,THE OTHER MAN.,"Transport. But, in spite of all these things, she loved him very"
17833,THE OTHER MAN.,madly; and there was some sort of an engagement between the two when
17834,THE OTHER MAN.,Schreiderling appeared and told Mrs. Gaurey that he wished to marry her
17835,THE OTHER MAN.,daughter. Then the other engagement was broken off--washed away by
17836,THE OTHER MAN.,"Mrs. Gaurey's tears, for that lady governed her house by weeping over"
17837,THE OTHER MAN.,disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received
17838,THE OTHER MAN.,in her old age. The daughter did not take after her mother. She never
17839,THE OTHER MAN.,cried. Not even at the wedding.
17840,THE OTHER MAN.,
17841,THE OTHER MAN.,"The Other Man bore his loss quietly, and was transferred to as bad a"
17842,THE OTHER MAN.,station as he could find. Perhaps the climate consoled him. He suffered
17843,THE OTHER MAN.,"from intermittent fever, and that may have distracted him from his other"
17844,THE OTHER MAN.,trouble. He was weak about the heart also. Both ways. One of the valves
17845,THE OTHER MAN.,"was affected, and the fever made it worse."
17846,THE OTHER MAN.,
17847,THE OTHER MAN.,This showed itself later on.
17848,THE OTHER MAN.,
17849,THE OTHER MAN.,"Then many months passed, and Mrs. Schreiderling took to being ill."
17850,THE OTHER MAN.,
17851,THE OTHER MAN.,"She did not pine away like people in story books, but she seemed to pick"
17852,THE OTHER MAN.,"up every form of illness that went about a station, from simple fever"
17853,THE OTHER MAN.,upwards. She was never more than ordinarily pretty at the best of times;
17854,THE OTHER MAN.,and the illness made her ugly. Schreiderling said so. He prided himself
17855,THE OTHER MAN.,on speaking his mind.
17856,THE OTHER MAN.,
17857,THE OTHER MAN.,"When she ceased being pretty, he left her to her own devices, and went"
17858,THE OTHER MAN.,back to the lairs of his bachelordom. She used to trot up and down Simla
17859,THE OTHER MAN.,"Mall in a forlorn sort of way, with a gray Terai hat well on the back of"
17860,THE OTHER MAN.,"her head, and a shocking bad saddle under her."
17861,THE OTHER MAN.,
17862,THE OTHER MAN.,Schreiderling's generosity stopped at the horse. He said that any saddle
17863,THE OTHER MAN.,would do for a woman as nervous as Mrs. Schreiderling. She never was
17864,THE OTHER MAN.,"asked to dance, because she did not dance well; and she was so dull"
17865,THE OTHER MAN.,"and uninteresting, that her box very seldom had any cards in it."
17866,THE OTHER MAN.,Schreiderling said that if he had known that she was going to be such
17867,THE OTHER MAN.,"a scare-crow after her marriage, he would never have married her. He"
17868,THE OTHER MAN.,"always prided himself on speaking his mind, did Schreiderling!"
17869,THE OTHER MAN.,
17870,THE OTHER MAN.,"He left her at Simla one August, and went down to his regiment."
17871,THE OTHER MAN.,
17872,THE OTHER MAN.,"Then she revived a little, but she never recovered her looks. I found"
17873,THE OTHER MAN.,out at the Club that the Other Man is coming up sick--very sick--on an
17874,THE OTHER MAN.,off chance of recovery. The fever and the heart-valves had nearly
17875,THE OTHER MAN.,"killed him. She knew that, too, and she knew--what I had no interest in"
17876,THE OTHER MAN.,knowing--when he was coming up. I suppose he wrote to tell her. They had
17877,THE OTHER MAN.,not seen each other since a month before the wedding. And here comes the
17878,THE OTHER MAN.,unpleasant part of the story.
17879,THE OTHER MAN.,
17880,THE OTHER MAN.,A late call kept me down at the Dovedell Hotel till dusk one evening.
17881,THE OTHER MAN.,Mrs. Schreidlerling had been flitting up and down the Mall all the
17882,THE OTHER MAN.,"afternoon in the rain. Coming up along the Cart-road, a tonga passed me,"
17883,THE OTHER MAN.,"and my pony, tired with standing so long, set off at a canter. Just by"
17884,THE OTHER MAN.,"the road down to the Tonga Office Mrs. Schreiderling, dripping from head"
17885,THE OTHER MAN.,"to foot, was waiting for the tonga. I turned up-hill, as the tonga was"
17886,THE OTHER MAN.,no affair of mine; and just then she began to shriek. I went back at
17887,THE OTHER MAN.,"once and saw, under the Tonga Office lamps, Mrs. Schreiderling kneeling"
17888,THE OTHER MAN.,"in the wet road by the back seat of the newly-arrived tonga, screaming"
17889,THE OTHER MAN.,hideously.
17890,THE OTHER MAN.,
17891,THE OTHER MAN.,Then she fell face down in the dirt as I came up.
17892,THE OTHER MAN.,
17893,THE OTHER MAN.,"Sitting in the back seat, very square and firm, with one hand on the"
17894,THE OTHER MAN.,"awning-stanchion and the wet pouring off his hat and moustache, was the"
17895,THE OTHER MAN.,Other Man--dead. The sixty-mile up-hill jolt had been too much for his
17896,THE OTHER MAN.,"valve, I suppose. The tonga-driver said:--""The Sahib died two stages out"
17897,THE OTHER MAN.,"of Solon. Therefore, I tied him with a rope, lest he should fall out"
17898,THE OTHER MAN.,"by the way, and so came to Simla. Will the Sahib give me bukshish? IT,"""
17899,THE OTHER MAN.,"pointing to the Other Man, ""should have given one rupee."""
17900,THE OTHER MAN.,
17901,THE OTHER MAN.,"The Other Man sat with a grin on his face, as if he enjoyed the joke of"
17902,THE OTHER MAN.,"his arrival; and Mrs. Schreiderling, in the mud, began to groan. There"
17903,THE OTHER MAN.,was no one except us four in the office and it was raining heavily. The
17904,THE OTHER MAN.,"first thing was to take Mrs. Schreiderling home, and the second was to"
17905,THE OTHER MAN.,prevent her name from being mixed up with the affair. The tonga-driver
17906,THE OTHER MAN.,received five rupees to find a bazar 'rickshaw for Mrs. Schreiderling.
17907,THE OTHER MAN.,"He was to tell the tonga Babu afterwards of the Other Man, and the Babu"
17908,THE OTHER MAN.,was to make such arrangements as seemed best.
17909,THE OTHER MAN.,
17910,THE OTHER MAN.,"Mrs. Schreiderling was carried into the shed out of the rain, and for"
17911,THE OTHER MAN.,three-quarters of an hour we two waited for the 'rickshaw. The Other
17912,THE OTHER MAN.,Man was left exactly as he had arrived. Mrs. Schreiderling would do
17913,THE OTHER MAN.,"everything but cry, which might have helped her. She tried to scream as"
17914,THE OTHER MAN.,"soon as her senses came back, and then she began praying for the Other"
17915,THE OTHER MAN.,"Man's soul. Had she not been as honest as the day, she would have prayed"
17916,THE OTHER MAN.,"for her own soul too. I waited to hear her do this, but she did not."
17917,THE OTHER MAN.,"Then I tried to get some of the mud off her habit. Lastly, the 'rickshaw"
17918,THE OTHER MAN.,"came, and I got her away--partly by force. It was a terrible business"
17919,THE OTHER MAN.,from beginning to end; but most of all when the 'rickshaw had to squeeze
17920,THE OTHER MAN.,"between the wall and the tonga, and she saw by the lamp-light that thin,"
17921,THE OTHER MAN.,yellow hand grasping the awning-stanchion.
17922,THE OTHER MAN.,
17923,THE OTHER MAN.,She was taken home just as every one was going to a dance at Viceregal
17924,THE OTHER MAN.,"Lodge--""Peterhoff"" it was then--and the doctor found that she had fallen"
17925,THE OTHER MAN.,"from her horse, that I had picked her up at the back of Jakko, and"
17926,THE OTHER MAN.,really deserved great credit for the prompt manner in which I had
17927,THE OTHER MAN.,secured medical aid. She did not die--men of Schreiderling's stamp marry
17928,THE OTHER MAN.,women who don't die easily. They live and grow ugly.
17929,THE OTHER MAN.,
17930,THE OTHER MAN.,"She never told of her one meeting, since her marriage, with the Other"
17931,THE OTHER MAN.,"Man; and, when the chill and cough following the exposure of that"
17932,THE OTHER MAN.,"evening, allowed her abroad, she never by word or sign alluded to having"
17933,THE OTHER MAN.,met me by the Tonga Office. Perhaps she never knew.
17934,THE OTHER MAN.,
17935,THE OTHER MAN.,"She used to trot up and down the Mall, on that shocking bad saddle,"
17936,THE OTHER MAN.,looking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner every
17937,THE OTHER MAN.,"minute. Two years afterward, she went Home, and died--at Bournemouth, I"
17938,THE OTHER MAN.,think.
17939,THE OTHER MAN.,
17940,THE OTHER MAN.,"Schreiderling, when he grew maudlin at Mess, used to talk about ""my"

17966,CONSEQUENCES.,
17967,CONSEQUENCES.,Tarrion came from goodness knows where--all away and away in some
17968,CONSEQUENCES.,"forsaken part of Central India, where they call Pachmari a ""Sanitarium,"""
17969,CONSEQUENCES.,"and drive behind trotting bullocks, I believe. He belonged to a"
17970,CONSEQUENCES.,regiment; but what he really wanted to do was to escape from his
17971,CONSEQUENCES.,regiment and live in Simla forever and ever. He had no preference for
17972,CONSEQUENCES.,"anything in particular, beyond a good horse and a nice partner. He"
17973,CONSEQUENCES.,thought he could do everything well; which is a beautiful belief when
17974,CONSEQUENCES.,"you hold it with all your heart. He was clever in many ways, and good to"
17975,CONSEQUENCES.,"look at, and always made people round him comfortable--even in Central"
17976,CONSEQUENCES.,India.
17977,CONSEQUENCES.,
17978,CONSEQUENCES.,"So he went up to Simla, and, because he was clever and amusing, he"
17979,CONSEQUENCES.,"gravitated naturally to Mrs. Hauksbee, who could forgive everything"
17980,CONSEQUENCES.,but stupidity. Once he did her great service by changing the date on an
17981,CONSEQUENCES.,"invitation-card for a big dance which Mrs. Hauksbee wished to attend,"
17982,CONSEQUENCES.,"but couldn't because she had quarrelled with the A.-D.-C., who took"
17983,CONSEQUENCES.,"care, being a mean man, to invite her to a small dance on the 6th"
17984,CONSEQUENCES.,instead of the big Ball of the 26th. It was a very clever piece of
17985,CONSEQUENCES.,"forgery; and when Mrs. Hauksbee showed the A.-D.-C. her invitation-card,"
17986,CONSEQUENCES.,"and chaffed him mildly for not better managing his vendettas, he really"
17987,CONSEQUENCES.,thought he had made a mistake; and--which was wise--realized that it
17988,CONSEQUENCES.,was no use to fight with Mrs. Hauksbee. She was grateful to Tarrion and
17989,CONSEQUENCES.,"asked what she could do for him. He said simply: ""I'm a Freelance up"
17990,CONSEQUENCES.,"here on leave, and on the lookout for what I can loot. I haven't a"
17991,CONSEQUENCES.,square inch of interest in all Simla. My name isn't known to any man
17992,CONSEQUENCES.,"with an appointment in his gift, and I want an appointment--a good,"
17993,CONSEQUENCES.,"sound, pukka one. I believe you can do anything you turn yourself to do."
17994,CONSEQUENCES.,"Will you help me?"" Mrs. Hauksbee thought for a minute, and passed"
17995,CONSEQUENCES.,"the last of her riding-whip through her lips, as was her custom when"
17996,CONSEQUENCES.,thinking.
17997,CONSEQUENCES.,
17998,CONSEQUENCES.,"Then her eyes sparkled, and she said:--""I will;"" and she shook hands"
17999,CONSEQUENCES.,"on it. Tarrion, having perfect confidence in this great woman, took no"
18000,CONSEQUENCES.,further thought of the business at all. Except to wonder what sort of an
18001,CONSEQUENCES.,appointment he would win.
18002,CONSEQUENCES.,
18003,CONSEQUENCES.,Mrs. Hauksbee began calculating the prices of all the Heads of
18004,CONSEQUENCES.,"Departments and Members of Council she knew, and the more she thought"
18005,CONSEQUENCES.,"the more she laughed, because her heart was in the game and it amused"
18006,CONSEQUENCES.,her. Then she took a Civil List and ran over a few of the appointments.
18007,CONSEQUENCES.,"There are some beautiful appointments in the Civil List. Eventually, she"
18008,CONSEQUENCES.,"decided that, though Tarrion was too good for the Political Department,"
18009,CONSEQUENCES.,she had better begin by trying to get him in there. What were her own
18010,CONSEQUENCES.,"plans to this end, does not matter in the least, for Luck or Fate played"
18011,CONSEQUENCES.,"into her hands, and she had nothing to do but to watch the course of"
18012,CONSEQUENCES.,events and take the credit of them.
18013,CONSEQUENCES.,
18014,CONSEQUENCES.,"All Viceroys, when they first come out, pass through the ""Diplomatic"

18030,CONSEQUENCES.,"in order, to refrain from kidnapping women, or filling offenders with"
18031,CONSEQUENCES.,"pounded red pepper, and eccentricities of that kind. Of course, these"
18032,CONSEQUENCES.,"things could never be made public, because Native Princes never err"
18033,CONSEQUENCES.,"officially, and their States are, officially, as well administered as"
18034,CONSEQUENCES.,"Our territories. Also, the private allowances to various queer people"
18035,CONSEQUENCES.,"are not exactly matters to put into newspapers, though they give quaint"
18036,CONSEQUENCES.,reading sometimes.
18037,CONSEQUENCES.,
18038,CONSEQUENCES.,"When the Supreme Government is at Simla, these papers are prepared"
18039,CONSEQUENCES.,"there, and go round to the people who ought to see them in office-boxes"
18040,CONSEQUENCES.,or by post. The principle of secrecy was to that Viceroy quite as
18041,CONSEQUENCES.,"important as the practice, and he held that a benevolent despotism like"
18042,CONSEQUENCES.,"Ours should never allow even little things, such as appointments of"
18043,CONSEQUENCES.,"subordinate clerks, to leak out till the proper time. He was always"
18044,CONSEQUENCES.,remarkable for his principles.
18045,CONSEQUENCES.,
18046,CONSEQUENCES.,There was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time.
18047,CONSEQUENCES.,It had to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand.
18048,CONSEQUENCES.,
18049,CONSEQUENCES.,"It was not put into an official envelope, but a large, square, pale-pink"
18050,CONSEQUENCES.,one; the matter being in MS. on soft crinkly paper. It was addressed to
18051,CONSEQUENCES.,"""The Head Clerk, etc., etc."" Now, between ""The Head Clerk, etc., etc.,"""
18052,CONSEQUENCES.,"and ""Mrs. Hauksbee"" and a flourish, is no very great difference if the"
18053,CONSEQUENCES.,"address be written in a very bad hand, as this was. The chaprassi who"
18054,CONSEQUENCES.,took the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis. He
18055,CONSEQUENCES.,"merely forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered, and"
18056,CONSEQUENCES.,"so asked the first Englishman he met, who happened to be a man riding"
18057,CONSEQUENCES.,"down to Annandale in a great hurry. The Englishman hardly looked, said:"
18058,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Hauksbee Sahib ki Mem,"" and went on. So did the chaprassi, because that"
18059,CONSEQUENCES.,letter was the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over. There
18060,CONSEQUENCES.,was no book to sign; he thrust the letter into Mrs. Hauksbee's bearer's
18061,CONSEQUENCES.,hands and went off to smoke with a friend.
18062,CONSEQUENCES.,
18063,CONSEQUENCES.,Mrs. Hauksbee was expecting some cut-out pattern things in flimsy paper
18064,CONSEQUENCES.,"from a friend. As soon as she got the big square packet, therefore, she"
18065,CONSEQUENCES.,"said, ""Oh, the DEAR creature!"" and tore it open with a paper-knife, and"
18066,CONSEQUENCES.,all the MS. enclosures tumbled out on the floor.
18067,CONSEQUENCES.,
18068,CONSEQUENCES.,Mrs. Hauksbee began reading. I have said the batch was rather
18069,CONSEQUENCES.,important. That is quite enough for you to know. It referred to some
18070,CONSEQUENCES.,"correspondence, two measures, a peremptory order to a native chief and"
18071,CONSEQUENCES.,"two dozen other things. Mrs. Hauksbee gasped as she read, for the first"
18072,CONSEQUENCES.,"glimpse of the naked machinery of the Great Indian Government, stripped"
18073,CONSEQUENCES.,"of its casings, and lacquer, and paint, and guard-rails, impresses even"
18074,CONSEQUENCES.,the most stupid man. And Mrs. Hauksbee was a clever woman. She was
18075,CONSEQUENCES.,"a little afraid at first, and felt as if she had laid hold of a"
18076,CONSEQUENCES.,"lightning-flash by the tail, and did not quite know what to do with it."
18077,CONSEQUENCES.,There were remarks and initials at the side of the papers; and some
18078,CONSEQUENCES.,of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers. The initials
18079,CONSEQUENCES.,belonged to men who are all dead or gone now; but they were great in
18080,CONSEQUENCES.,their day.
18081,CONSEQUENCES.,
18082,CONSEQUENCES.,Mrs. Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read. Then the value of
18083,CONSEQUENCES.,"her trove struck her, and she cast about for the best method of using"
18084,CONSEQUENCES.,"it. Then Tarrion dropped in, and they read through all the papers"
18085,CONSEQUENCES.,"together, and Tarrion, not knowing how she had come by them, vowed that"
18086,CONSEQUENCES.,Mrs. Hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth.
18087,CONSEQUENCES.,
18088,CONSEQUENCES.,"Which I believe was true, or nearly so."
18089,CONSEQUENCES.,
18090,CONSEQUENCES.,"""The honest course is always the best,"" said Tarrion after an hour and a"
18091,CONSEQUENCES.,"half of study and conversation. ""All things considered, the Intelligence"
18092,CONSEQUENCES.,Branch is about my form. Either that or the Foreign Office. I go to lay
18093,CONSEQUENCES.,"siege to the High Gods in their Temples."""
18094,CONSEQUENCES.,
18095,CONSEQUENCES.,"He did not seek a little man, or a little big man, or a weak Head of a"
18096,CONSEQUENCES.,"strong Department, but he called on the biggest and strongest man that"
18097,CONSEQUENCES.,"the Government owned, and explained that he wanted an appointment at"
18098,CONSEQUENCES.,Simla on a good salary. The compound insolence of this amused the Strong
18099,CONSEQUENCES.,"Man, and, as he had nothing to do for the moment, he listened to the"
18100,CONSEQUENCES.,proposals of the audacious Tarrion.
18101,CONSEQUENCES.,
18102,CONSEQUENCES.,"""You have, I presume, some special qualifications, besides the gift of"
18103,CONSEQUENCES.,"self-assertion, for the claims you put forwards?"" said the Strong Man."
18104,CONSEQUENCES.,"""That, Sir,"" said Tarrion, ""is for you to judge."" Then he began, for"
18105,CONSEQUENCES.,"he had a good memory, quoting a few of the more important notes in the"
18106,CONSEQUENCES.,papers--slowly and one by one as a man drops chlorodyne into a glass.
18107,CONSEQUENCES.,When he had reached the peremptory order--and it WAS a peremptory
18108,CONSEQUENCES.,order--the Strong Man was troubled.
18109,CONSEQUENCES.,
18110,CONSEQUENCES.,"Tarrion wound up:--""And I fancy that special knowledge of this kind is"
18111,CONSEQUENCES.,"at least as valuable for, let us say, a berth in the Foreign Office, as"
18112,CONSEQUENCES.,"the fact of being the nephew of a distinguished officer's wife."" That"
18113,CONSEQUENCES.,"hit the Strong Man hard, for the last appointment to the Foreign Office"
18114,CONSEQUENCES.,"had been by black favor, and he knew it. ""I'll see what I can do for"
18115,CONSEQUENCES.,"you,"" said the Strong Man. ""Many thanks,"" said Tarrion. Then he left,"
18116,CONSEQUENCES.,and the Strong Man departed to see how the appointment was to be
18117,CONSEQUENCES.,blocked..........
18118,CONSEQUENCES.,
18119,CONSEQUENCES.,Followed a pause of eleven days; with thunders and lightnings and much
18120,CONSEQUENCES.,"telegraphing. The appointment was not a very important one, carrying"
18121,CONSEQUENCES.,"only between Rs. 500 and Rs. 700 a month; but, as the Viceroy said, it"
18122,CONSEQUENCES.,"was the principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained,"
18123,CONSEQUENCES.,and it was more than likely that a boy so well supplied with special
18124,CONSEQUENCES.,information would be worth translating. So they translated him. They
18125,CONSEQUENCES.,"must have suspected him, though he protested that his information was"
18126,CONSEQUENCES.,"due to singular talents of his own. Now, much of this story, including"
18127,CONSEQUENCES.,"the after-history of the missing envelope, you must fill in for"
18128,CONSEQUENCES.,"yourself, because there are reasons why it cannot be written. If you do"
18129,CONSEQUENCES.,"not know about things Up Above, you won't understand how to fill it in,"
18130,CONSEQUENCES.,and you will say it is impossible.
18131,CONSEQUENCES.,
18132,CONSEQUENCES.,"What the Viceroy said when Tarrion was introduced to him was:--""So, this"
18133,CONSEQUENCES.,"is the boy who 'rusked' the Government of India, is it? Recollect, Sir,"
18134,CONSEQUENCES.,"that is not done TWICE."" So he must have known something."
18135,CONSEQUENCES.,
18136,CONSEQUENCES.,"What Tarrion said when he saw his appointment gazetted was:--""If Mrs."
18137,CONSEQUENCES.,"Hauksbee were twenty years younger, and I her husband, I should be"
18138,CONSEQUENCES.,"Viceroy of India in twenty years."""
18139,CONSEQUENCES.,
18140,CONSEQUENCES.,"What Mrs. Hauksbee said, when Tarrion thanked her, almost with tears"
18141,CONSEQUENCES.,"in his eyes, was first:--""I told you so!"" and next, to herself:--""What"
18142,CONSEQUENCES.,"fools men are!"""
18143,CONSEQUENCES.,
18144,CONSEQUENCES.,
18145,CONSEQUENCES.,
18146,CONSEQUENCES.,
18147,CONSEQUENCES.,THE CONVERSION OF AURELIAN McGOGGIN.
18148,CONSEQUENCES.,
18149,CONSEQUENCES.,"Ride with an idle whip, ride with an unused heel."
18150,CONSEQUENCES.,"But, once in a way, there will come a day"
18151,CONSEQUENCES.,When the colt must be taught to feel
18152,CONSEQUENCES.,"The lash that falls, and the curb that galls,"
18153,CONSEQUENCES.,And the sting of the rowelled steel.
18154,CONSEQUENCES.,--Life's Handicap.
18155,CONSEQUENCES.,
18156,CONSEQUENCES.,This is not a tale exactly. It is a Tract; and I am immensely proud of
18157,CONSEQUENCES.,it. Making a Tract is a Feat.
18158,CONSEQUENCES.,
18159,CONSEQUENCES.,Every man is entitled to his own religious opinions; but no man--least
18160,CONSEQUENCES.,of all a junior--has a right to thrust these down other men's throats.
18161,CONSEQUENCES.,The Government sends out weird Civilians now and again; but McGoggin
18162,CONSEQUENCES.,was the queerest exported for a long time. He was clever--brilliantly
18163,CONSEQUENCES.,clever--but his cleverness worked the wrong way. Instead of keeping to
18164,CONSEQUENCES.,"the study of the vernaculars, he had read some books written by a"
18165,CONSEQUENCES.,"man called Comte, I think, and a man called Spencer, and a Professor"
18166,CONSEQUENCES.,Clifford. [You will find these books in the Library.] They deal with
18167,CONSEQUENCES.,people's insides from the point of view of men who have no stomachs.
18168,CONSEQUENCES.,There was no order against his reading them; but his Mamma should have
18169,CONSEQUENCES.,smacked him.
18170,CONSEQUENCES.,
18171,CONSEQUENCES.,"They fermented in his head, and he came out to India with a rarefied"
18172,CONSEQUENCES.,religion over and above his work. It was not much of a creed. It only
18173,CONSEQUENCES.,"proved that men had no souls, and there was no God and no hereafter, and"
18174,CONSEQUENCES.,that you must worry along somehow for the good of Humanity.
18175,CONSEQUENCES.,
18176,CONSEQUENCES.,One of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than
18177,CONSEQUENCES.,"giving an order was obeying it. At least, that was what McGoggin said;"
18178,CONSEQUENCES.,but I suspect he had misread his primers.
18179,CONSEQUENCES.,
18180,CONSEQUENCES.,"I do not say a word against this creed. It was made up in Town, where"
18181,CONSEQUENCES.,there is nothing but machinery and asphalt and building--all shut in
18182,CONSEQUENCES.,"by the fog. Naturally, a man grows to think that there is no one higher"
18183,CONSEQUENCES.,"than himself, and that the Metropolitan Board of Works made everything."
18184,CONSEQUENCES.,"But in this country, where you really see humanity--raw, brown, naked"
18185,CONSEQUENCES.,"humanity--with nothing between it and the blazing sky, and only the"
18186,CONSEQUENCES.,"used-up, over-handled earth underfoot, the notion somehow dies away,"
18187,CONSEQUENCES.,"and most folk come back to simpler theories. Life, in India, is not long"
18188,CONSEQUENCES.,enough to waste in proving that there is no one in particular at the
18189,CONSEQUENCES.,head of affairs.
18190,CONSEQUENCES.,
18191,CONSEQUENCES.,"For this reason. The Deputy is above the Assistant, the Commissioner"
18192,CONSEQUENCES.,"above the Deputy, the Lieutenant-Governor above the Commissioner, and"
18193,CONSEQUENCES.,"the Viceroy above all four, under the orders of the Secretary of State,"
18194,CONSEQUENCES.,who is responsible to the Empress. If the Empress be not responsible to
18195,CONSEQUENCES.,her Maker--if there is no Maker for her to be responsible to--the
18196,CONSEQUENCES.,entire system of Our administration must be wrong. Which is manifestly
18197,CONSEQUENCES.,impossible. At Home men are to be excused. They are stalled up a good
18198,CONSEQUENCES.,"deal and get intellectually ""beany."" When you take a gross, ""beany"""
18199,CONSEQUENCES.,"horse to exercise, he slavers and slobbers over the bit till you can't"
18200,CONSEQUENCES.,see the horns.
18201,CONSEQUENCES.,
18202,CONSEQUENCES.,"But the bit is there just the same. Men do not get ""beany"" in India. The"
18203,CONSEQUENCES.,climate and the work are against playing bricks with words.
18204,CONSEQUENCES.,
18205,CONSEQUENCES.,"If McGoggin had kept his creed, with the capital letters and the endings"
18206,CONSEQUENCES.,"in ""isms,"" to himself, no one would have cared; but his grandfathers on"
18207,CONSEQUENCES.,"both sides had been Wesleyan preachers, and the preaching strain came"
18208,CONSEQUENCES.,out in his mind. He wanted every one at the Club to see that they had no
18209,CONSEQUENCES.,"souls too, and to help him to eliminate his Creator. As a good many men"
18210,CONSEQUENCES.,"told him, HE undoubtedly had no soul, because he was so young, but it"
18211,CONSEQUENCES.,"did not follow that his seniors were equally undeveloped; and, whether"
18212,CONSEQUENCES.,"there was another world or not, a man still wanted to read his papers in"
18213,CONSEQUENCES.,"this. ""But that is not the point--that is not the point!"" Aurelian used"
18214,CONSEQUENCES.,to say. Then men threw sofa-cushions at him and told him to go to
18215,CONSEQUENCES.,any particular place he might believe in. They christened him the
18216,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Blastoderm""--he said he came from a family of that name somewhere, in"
18217,CONSEQUENCES.,"the pre-historic ages--and, by insult and laughter, strove to choke him"
18218,CONSEQUENCES.,"dumb, for he was an unmitigated nuisance at the Club; besides being an"
18219,CONSEQUENCES.,"offence to the older men. His Deputy Commissioner, who was working on"
18220,CONSEQUENCES.,"the Frontier when Aurelian was rolling on a bed-quilt, told him that,"
18221,CONSEQUENCES.,"for a clever boy, Aurelian was a very big idiot. And, you know, if"
18222,CONSEQUENCES.,"he had gone on with his work, he would have been caught up to the"
18223,CONSEQUENCES.,Secretariat in a few years. He was just the type that goes there--all
18224,CONSEQUENCES.,"head, no physique and a hundred theories. Not a soul was interested in"
18225,CONSEQUENCES.,"McGoggin's soul. He might have had two, or none, or somebody's else's."
18226,CONSEQUENCES.,His business was to obey orders and keep abreast of his files instead of
18227,CONSEQUENCES.,"devastating the Club with ""isms."""
18228,CONSEQUENCES.,
18229,CONSEQUENCES.,He worked brilliantly; but he could not accept any order without
18230,CONSEQUENCES.,trying to better it. That was the fault of his creed. It made men too
18231,CONSEQUENCES.,responsible and left too much to their honor. You can sometimes ride an
18232,CONSEQUENCES.,old horse in a halter; but never a colt.
18233,CONSEQUENCES.,
18234,CONSEQUENCES.,McGoggin took more trouble over his cases than any of the men of his
18235,CONSEQUENCES.,year. He may have fancied that thirty-page judgments on fifty-rupee
18236,CONSEQUENCES.,cases--both sides perjured to the gullet--advanced the cause of
18237,CONSEQUENCES.,"Humanity. At any rate, he worked too much, and worried and fretted over"
18238,CONSEQUENCES.,"the rebukes he received, and lectured away on his ridiculous creed out"
18239,CONSEQUENCES.,"of office, till the Doctor had to warn him that he was overdoing it. No"
18240,CONSEQUENCES.,man can toil eighteen annas in the rupee in June without suffering. But
18241,CONSEQUENCES.,"McGoggin was still intellectually ""beany"" and proud of himself and his"
18242,CONSEQUENCES.,"powers, and he would take no hint. He worked nine hours a day steadily."
18243,CONSEQUENCES.,
18244,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Very well,"" said the doctor, ""you'll break down because you are"
18245,CONSEQUENCES.,"over-engined for your beam."" McGoggin was a little chap."
18246,CONSEQUENCES.,
18247,CONSEQUENCES.,"One day, the collapse came--as dramatically as if it had been meant to"
18248,CONSEQUENCES.,embellish a Tract.
18249,CONSEQUENCES.,
18250,CONSEQUENCES.,It was just before the Rains. We were sitting in the verandah in the
18251,CONSEQUENCES.,"dead, hot, close air, gasping and praying that the black-blue clouds"
18252,CONSEQUENCES.,"would let down and bring the cool. Very, very far away, there was a"
18253,CONSEQUENCES.,"faint whisper, which was the roar of the Rains breaking over the river."
18254,CONSEQUENCES.,"One of the men heard it, got out of his chair, listened, and said,"
18255,CONSEQUENCES.,"naturally enough:--""Thank God!"""
18256,CONSEQUENCES.,
18257,CONSEQUENCES.,"Then the Blastoderm turned in his place and said:--""Why? I assure you"
18258,CONSEQUENCES.,it's only the result of perfectly natural causes--atmospheric phenomena
18259,CONSEQUENCES.,"of the simplest kind. Why you should, therefore, return thanks to a"
18260,CONSEQUENCES.,"Being who never did exist--who is only a figment--"""
18261,CONSEQUENCES.,
18262,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Blastoderm,"" grunted the man in the next chair, ""dry up, and throw"
18263,CONSEQUENCES.,"me over the Pioneer. We know all about your figments."" The Blastoderm"
18264,CONSEQUENCES.,"reached out to the table, took up one paper, and jumped as if something"
18265,CONSEQUENCES.,had stung him. Then he handed the paper over.
18266,CONSEQUENCES.,
18267,CONSEQUENCES.,"""As I was saying,"" he went on slowly and with an effort--""due to"
18268,CONSEQUENCES.,"perfectly natural causes--perfectly natural causes. I mean--"""
18269,CONSEQUENCES.,
18270,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Hi! Blastoderm, you've given me the Calcutta Mercantile Advertiser."""
18271,CONSEQUENCES.,
18272,CONSEQUENCES.,"The dust got up in little whorls, while the treetops rocked and the"
18273,CONSEQUENCES.,kites whistled. But no one was looking at the coming of the Rains.
18274,CONSEQUENCES.,
18275,CONSEQUENCES.,"We were all staring at the Blastoderm, who had risen from his chair and"
18276,CONSEQUENCES.,"was fighting with his speech. Then he said, still more slowly:--"
18277,CONSEQUENCES.,
18278,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Perfectly conceivable--dictionary--red"
18279,CONSEQUENCES.,"oak--amenable--cause--retaining--shuttlecock--alone."""
18280,CONSEQUENCES.,
18281,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Blastoderm's drunk,"" said one man. But the Blastoderm was not drunk. He"
18282,CONSEQUENCES.,"looked at us in a dazed sort of way, and began motioning with his hands"
18283,CONSEQUENCES.,in the half light as the clouds closed overhead.
18284,CONSEQUENCES.,
18285,CONSEQUENCES.,Then--with a scream:--
18286,CONSEQUENCES.,
18287,CONSEQUENCES.,"""What is it?--Can't--reserve--attainable--market--obscure--"""
18288,CONSEQUENCES.,
18289,CONSEQUENCES.,"But his speech seemed to freeze in him, and--just as the lightning shot"
18290,CONSEQUENCES.,two tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain fell
18291,CONSEQUENCES.,in quivering sheets--the Blastoderm was struck dumb. He stood pawing and
18292,CONSEQUENCES.,"champing like a hard-held horse, and his eyes were full of terror."
18293,CONSEQUENCES.,
18294,CONSEQUENCES.,"The Doctor came over in three minutes, and heard the story. ""It's"
18295,CONSEQUENCES.,"aphasia,"" he said. ""Take him to his room. I KNEW the smash would come."""
18296,CONSEQUENCES.,"We carried the Blastoderm across, in the pouring rain, to his quarters,"
18297,CONSEQUENCES.,and the Doctor gave him bromide of potassium to make him sleep.
18298,CONSEQUENCES.,
18299,CONSEQUENCES.,Then the Doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all
18300,CONSEQUENCES.,"the arrears of ""Punjab Head"" falling in a lump; and that only once"
18301,CONSEQUENCES.,before--in the case of a sepoy--had he met with so complete a case.
18302,CONSEQUENCES.,"I myself have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man, but this sudden"
18303,CONSEQUENCES.,"dumbness was uncanny--though, as the Blastoderm himself might have said,"
18304,CONSEQUENCES.,"due to ""perfectly natural causes."""
18305,CONSEQUENCES.,
18306,CONSEQUENCES.,"""He'll have to take leave after this,"" said the Doctor. ""He won't be"
18307,CONSEQUENCES.,fit for work for another three months. No; it isn't insanity or anything
18308,CONSEQUENCES.,like it. It's only complete loss of control over the speech and memory.
18309,CONSEQUENCES.,"I fancy it will keep the Blastoderm quiet, though."""
18310,CONSEQUENCES.,
18311,CONSEQUENCES.,"Two days later, the Blastoderm found his tongue again. The first"
18312,CONSEQUENCES.,"question he asked was: ""What was it?"" The Doctor enlightened him."
18313,CONSEQUENCES.,
18314,CONSEQUENCES.,"""But I can't understand it!"" said the Blastoderm; ""I'm quite sane; but I"
18315,CONSEQUENCES.,"can't be sure of my mind, it seems--my OWN memory--can I?"""
18316,CONSEQUENCES.,
18317,CONSEQUENCES.,"""Go up into the Hills for three months, and don't think about it,"" said"
18318,CONSEQUENCES.,the Doctor.
18319,CONSEQUENCES.,
18320,CONSEQUENCES.,"""But I can't understand it,"" repeated the Blastoderm. ""It was my OWN"
18321,CONSEQUENCES.,"mind and memory."""
18322,CONSEQUENCES.,
18323,CONSEQUENCES.,"""I can't help it,"" said the Doctor; ""there are a good many things you"
18324,CONSEQUENCES.,"can't understand; and, by the time you have put in my length of service,"
18325,CONSEQUENCES.,"you'll know exactly how much a man dare call his own in this world."""
18326,CONSEQUENCES.,
18327,CONSEQUENCES.,The stroke cowed the Blastoderm. He could not understand it. He went
18328,CONSEQUENCES.,"into the Hills in fear and trembling, wondering whether he would be"
18329,CONSEQUENCES.,permitted to reach the end of any sentence he began.
18330,CONSEQUENCES.,
18331,CONSEQUENCES.,This gave him a wholesome feeling of mistrust. The legitimate
18332,CONSEQUENCES.,"explanation, that he had been overworking himself, failed to satisfy"
18333,CONSEQUENCES.,"him. Something had wiped his lips of speech, as a mother wipes the milky"
18334,CONSEQUENCES.,"lips of her child, and he was afraid--horribly afraid."
18335,CONSEQUENCES.,
18336,CONSEQUENCES.,So the Club had rest when he returned; and if ever you come across
18337,CONSEQUENCES.,Aurelian McGoggin laying down the law on things Human--he doesn't seem
18338,CONSEQUENCES.,to know as much as he used to about things Divine--put your forefinger
18339,CONSEQUENCES.,"on your lip for a moment, and see what happens."
18340,CONSEQUENCES.,
18341,CONSEQUENCES.,Don't blame me if he throws a glass at your head!

18355,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18356,A GERM DESTROYER.,This tale is a justifiable exception.

18358,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Once in every five years, as you know, we indent for a new Viceroy; and"
18359,A GERM DESTROYER.,"each Viceroy imports, with the rest of his baggage, a Private Secretary,"
18360,A GERM DESTROYER.,"who may or may not be the real Viceroy, just as Fate ordains. Fate looks"
18361,A GERM DESTROYER.,after the Indian Empire because it is so big and so helpless.
18362,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18363,A GERM DESTROYER.,"There was a Viceroy once, who brought out with him a turbulent Private"
18364,A GERM DESTROYER.,Secretary--a hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for
18365,A GERM DESTROYER.,work. This Secretary was called Wonder--John Fennil Wonder. The Viceroy
18366,A GERM DESTROYER.,possessed no name--nothing but a string of counties and two-thirds
18367,A GERM DESTROYER.,"of the alphabet after them. He said, in confidence, that he was the"
18368,A GERM DESTROYER.,"electro-plated figurehead of a golden administration, and he watched"
18369,A GERM DESTROYER.,"in a dreamy, amused way Wonder's attempts to draw matters which were"
18370,A GERM DESTROYER.,"entirely outside his province into his own hands. ""When we are all"
18371,A GERM DESTROYER.,"cherubims together,"" said His Excellency once, ""my dear, good friend"

18373,A GERM DESTROYER.,"or stealing Peter's keys. THEN I shall report him."""
18374,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18375,A GERM DESTROYER.,"But, though the Viceroy did nothing to check Wonder's officiousness,"
18376,A GERM DESTROYER.,other people said unpleasant things. Maybe the Members of Council began
18377,A GERM DESTROYER.,"it; but, finally, all Simla agreed that there was ""too much Wonder,"
18378,A GERM DESTROYER.,"and too little Viceroy,"" in that regime. Wonder was always quoting ""His"
18379,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Excellency."" It was ""His Excellency this,"" ""His Excellency that,"" ""In"
18380,A GERM DESTROYER.,"the opinion of His Excellency,"" and so on. The Viceroy smiled; but he"
18381,A GERM DESTROYER.,did not heed.
18382,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18383,A GERM DESTROYER.,"He said that, so long as his old men squabbled with his ""dear, good"

18386,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""No wise man has a policy,"" said the Viceroy. ""A Policy is the blackmail"

18389,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18390,A GERM DESTROYER.,"I do not quite see what this means, unless it refers to an Insurance"

18392,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18393,A GERM DESTROYER.,"That season, came up to Simla one of these crazy people with only a"
18394,A GERM DESTROYER.,single idea. These are the men who make things move; but they are not
18395,A GERM DESTROYER.,"nice to talk to. This man's name was Mellish, and he had lived for"
18396,A GERM DESTROYER.,"fifteen years on land of his own, in Lower Bengal, studying cholera. He"
18397,A GERM DESTROYER.,held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a
18398,A GERM DESTROYER.,muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake.
18399,A GERM DESTROYER.,"The germ could be rendered sterile, he said, by ""Mellish's Own"
18400,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Invincible Fumigatory""--a heavy violet-black powder--""the result of"

18402,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18403,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Inventors seem very much alike as a caste. They talk loudly, especially"
18404,A GERM DESTROYER.,"about ""conspiracies of monopolists;"" they beat upon the table with"
18405,A GERM DESTROYER.,their fists; and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their
18406,A GERM DESTROYER.,persons.
18407,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18408,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Mellish said that there was a Medical ""Ring"" at Simla, headed by the"
18409,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Surgeon-General, who was in league, apparently, with all the Hospital"
18410,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Assistants in the Empire. I forget exactly how he proved it, but it had"
18411,A GERM DESTROYER.,"something to do with ""skulking up to the Hills;"" and what Mellish"
18412,A GERM DESTROYER.,"wanted was the independent evidence of the Viceroy--""Steward of our"
18413,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, Sir."" So Mellish went up to Simla, with"
18414,A GERM DESTROYER.,"eighty-four pounds of Fumigatory in his trunk, to speak to the Viceroy"
18415,A GERM DESTROYER.,and to show him the merits of the invention.
18416,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18417,A GERM DESTROYER.,"But it is easier to see a Viceroy than to talk to him, unless you chance"
18418,A GERM DESTROYER.,to be as important as Mellishe of Madras. He was a six-thousand-rupee
18419,A GERM DESTROYER.,"man, so great that his daughters never ""married."" They ""contracted"
18420,A GERM DESTROYER.,"alliances."" He himself was not paid. He ""received emoluments,"" and his"
18421,A GERM DESTROYER.,"journeys about the country were ""tours of observation."" His business was"
18422,A GERM DESTROYER.,to stir up the people in Madras with a long pole--as you stir up stench
18423,A GERM DESTROYER.,in a pond--and the people had to come up out of their comfortable old
18424,A GERM DESTROYER.,"ways and gasp:--""This is Enlightenment and progress. Isn't it fine!"""
18425,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Then they gave Mellishe statues and jasmine garlands, in the hope of"
18426,A GERM DESTROYER.,getting rid of him.
18427,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18428,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Mellishe came up to Simla ""to confer with the Viceroy."" That was one of"
18429,A GERM DESTROYER.,his perquisites. The Viceroy knew nothing of Mellishe except that he was
18430,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""one of those middle-class deities who seem necessary to the spiritual"

18435,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18436,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Mellishe's name was E. Mellishe and Mellish's was E. S. Mellish, and"
18437,A GERM DESTROYER.,"they were both staying at the same hotel, and the Fate that looks after"

18442,A GERM DESTROYER.,"then,"" should be given to Mellish with the Fumigatory. He nearly wept"
18443,A GERM DESTROYER.,"with pride and delight, and at the appointed hour cantered off to"
18444,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Peterhoff, a big paper-bag full of the Fumigatory in his coat-tail"
18445,A GERM DESTROYER.,"pockets. He had his chance, and he meant to make the most of"

18457,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18458,A GERM DESTROYER.,"As soon as the cheroots were lit, Mellish spoke like a man; beginning"

18461,A GERM DESTROYER.,"his Fumigatory, while the Viceroy watched him between half-shut eyes"
18462,A GERM DESTROYER.,"and thought: ""Evidently, this is the wrong tiger; but it is an original"
18463,A GERM DESTROYER.,"animal."" Mellish's hair was standing on end with excitement, and he"
18464,A GERM DESTROYER.,"stammered. He began groping in his coat-tails and, before the Viceroy"
18465,A GERM DESTROYER.,"knew what was about to happen, he had tipped a bagful of his powder into"
18466,A GERM DESTROYER.,the big silver ash-tray.
18467,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18468,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""J-j-judge for yourself, Sir,"" said Mellish. ""Y' Excellency shall judge"

18470,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18471,A GERM DESTROYER.,"He plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder, which began to"
18472,A GERM DESTROYER.,"smoke like a volcano, and send up fat, greasy wreaths of copper-colored"
18473,A GERM DESTROYER.,smoke. In five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and
18474,A GERM DESTROYER.,sickening stench--a reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your
18475,A GERM DESTROYER.,"windpipe and shut it. The powder then hissed and fizzed, and sent out"
18476,A GERM DESTROYER.,"blue and green sparks, and the smoke rose till you could neither see,"

18479,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""Nitrate of strontia,"" he shouted; ""baryta, bone-meal, etcetera!"

18482,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18483,A GERM DESTROYER.,"But His Excellency had fled, and was coughing at the foot of the stairs,"
18484,A GERM DESTROYER.,"while all Peterhoff hummed like a hive. Red Lancers came in, and the"
18485,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Head Chaprassi, who speaks English, came in, and mace-bearers came in,"
18486,A GERM DESTROYER.,"and ladies ran downstairs screaming ""fire;"" for the smoke was drifting"
18487,A GERM DESTROYER.,"through the house and oozing out of the windows, and bellying along the"
18488,A GERM DESTROYER.,"verandahs, and wreathing and writhing across the gardens. No one could"
18489,A GERM DESTROYER.,"enter the room where Mellish was lecturing on his Fumigatory, till that"
18490,A GERM DESTROYER.,unspeakable powder had burned itself out.
18491,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18492,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Then an Aide-de-Camp, who desired the V. C., rushed through the rolling"

18494,A GERM DESTROYER.,"laughter, and could only waggle his hands feebly at Mellish, who was"
18495,A GERM DESTROYER.,shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him.
18496,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18497,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""Glorious! Glorious!"" sobbed his Excellency. ""Not a germ, as you justly"
18498,A GERM DESTROYER.,"observe, could exist! I can swear it. A magnificent success!"""
18499,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18500,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Then he laughed till the tears came, and Wonder, who had caught the real"
18501,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Mellishe snorting on the Mall, entered and was deeply shocked at the"
18502,A GERM DESTROYER.,"scene. But the Viceroy was delighted, because he saw that Wonder would"
18503,A GERM DESTROYER.,"presently depart. Mellish with the Fumigatory was also pleased, for he"
18504,A GERM DESTROYER.,"felt that he had smashed the Simla Medical ""Ring.""........."
18505,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18506,A GERM DESTROYER.,"Few men could tell a story like His Excellency when he took the trouble,"
18507,A GERM DESTROYER.,"and the account of ""my dear, good Wonder's friend with the powder"""
18508,A GERM DESTROYER.,"went the round of Simla, and flippant folk made Wonder unhappy by their"
18509,A GERM DESTROYER.,remarks.
18510,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18511,A GERM DESTROYER.,But His Excellency told the tale once too often--for Wonder. As he meant
18512,A GERM DESTROYER.,to do. It was at a Seepee Picnic. Wonder was sitting just behind the

18514,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18515,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""And I really thought for a moment,"" wound up His Excellency, ""that my"

18517,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18518,A GERM DESTROYER.,Every one laughed; but there was a delicate subtinkle in the Viceroy's
18519,A GERM DESTROYER.,tone which Wonder understood. He found that his health was giving way;
18520,A GERM DESTROYER.,"and the Viceroy allowed him to go, and presented him with a flaming"
18521,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""character"" for use at Home among big people."
18522,A GERM DESTROYER.,
18523,A GERM DESTROYER.,"""My fault entirely,"" said His Excellency, in after seasons, with"

18545,KIDNAPPED.,aboriginal notion--of arranging marriages irrespective of the personal
18546,KIDNAPPED.,"inclinations of the married, is sound. Think for a minute, and you will"
18547,KIDNAPPED.,"see that it must be so; unless, of course, you believe in ""affinities."""
18548,KIDNAPPED.,In which case you had better not read this tale. How can a man who has

18551,KIDNAPPED.,"felicity, go about the choosing of a wife? He cannot see straight or"
18552,KIDNAPPED.,think straight if he tries; and the same disadvantages exist in the
18553,KIDNAPPED.,"case of a girl's fancies. But when mature, married and discreet people"
18554,KIDNAPPED.,"arrange a match between a boy and a girl, they do it sensibly, with a"

18561,KIDNAPPED.,"love-match that has gone wrong, chained to the trees in the courtyard."
18562,KIDNAPPED.,"All marriages should be made through the Department, which might be"
18563,KIDNAPPED.,"subordinate to the Educational Department, under the same penalty as"
18564,KIDNAPPED.,that attaching to the transfer of land without a stamped document. But
18565,KIDNAPPED.,Government won't take suggestions. It pretends that it is too busy.
18566,KIDNAPPED.,"However, I will put my notion on record, and explain the example that"
18567,KIDNAPPED.,illustrates the theory.
18568,KIDNAPPED.,
18569,KIDNAPPED.,Once upon a time there was a good young man--a first-class officer in
18570,KIDNAPPED.,"his own Department--a man with a career before him and, possibly, a K."
18571,KIDNAPPED.,"C. G. E. at the end of it. All his superiors spoke well of him, because"
18572,KIDNAPPED.,he knew how to hold his tongue and his pen at the proper times. There
18573,KIDNAPPED.,are today only eleven men in India who possess this secret; and they
18574,KIDNAPPED.,"have all, with one exception, attained great honor and enormous incomes."
18575,KIDNAPPED.,
18576,KIDNAPPED.,This good young man was quiet and self-contained--too old for his years
18577,KIDNAPPED.,"by far. Which always carries its own punishment. Had a Subaltern, or a"
18578,KIDNAPPED.,"Tea-Planter's Assistant, or anybody who enjoys life and has no care for"
18579,KIDNAPPED.,"tomorrow, done what he tried to do not a soul would have cared. But when"
18580,KIDNAPPED.,"Peythroppe--the estimable, virtuous, economical, quiet, hard-working,"
18581,KIDNAPPED.,"young Peythroppe--fell, there was a flutter through five Departments."
18582,KIDNAPPED.,
18583,KIDNAPPED.,The manner of his fall was in this way. He met a Miss
18584,KIDNAPPED.,"Castries--d'Castries it was originally, but the family dropped the"
18585,KIDNAPPED.,d' for administrative reasons--and he fell in love with her even more
18586,KIDNAPPED.,energetically than he worked. Understand clearly that there was not a
18587,KIDNAPPED.,breath of a word to be said against Miss Castries--not a shadow of a
18588,KIDNAPPED.,breath. She was good and very lovely--possessed what innocent people at
18589,KIDNAPPED.,"home call a ""Spanish"" complexion, with thick blue-black hair growing low"
18590,KIDNAPPED.,"down on her forehead, into a ""widow's peak,"" and big violet eyes"
18591,KIDNAPPED.,under eyebrows as black and as straight as the borders of a Gazette
18592,KIDNAPPED.,"Extraordinary when a big man dies. But--but--but--. Well, she was a VERY"
18593,KIDNAPPED.,"sweet girl and very pious, but for many reasons she was ""impossible."""
18594,KIDNAPPED.,"Quite so. All good Mammas know what ""impossible"" means. It was obviously"
18595,KIDNAPPED.,absurd that Peythroppe should marry her. The little opal-tinted onyx
18596,KIDNAPPED.,at the base of her finger-nails said this as plainly as print.
18597,KIDNAPPED.,"Further, marriage with Miss Castries meant marriage with several other"
18598,KIDNAPPED.,"Castries--Honorary Lieutenant Castries, her Papa, Mrs. Eulalie Castries,"
18599,KIDNAPPED.,"her Mamma, and all the ramifications of the Castries family, on incomes"
18600,KIDNAPPED.,"ranging from Rs. 175 to Rs. 470 a month, and THEIR wives and connections"
18601,KIDNAPPED.,again.
18602,KIDNAPPED.,
18603,KIDNAPPED.,It would have been cheaper for Peythroppe to have assaulted a
18604,KIDNAPPED.,"Commissioner with a dog-whip, or to have burned the records of a Deputy"
18605,KIDNAPPED.,"Commissioner's Office, than to have contracted an alliance with the"
18606,KIDNAPPED.,Castries. It would have weighted his after-career less--even under a
18607,KIDNAPPED.,Government which never forgets and NEVER forgives.
18608,KIDNAPPED.,
18609,KIDNAPPED.,"Everybody saw this but Peythroppe. He was going to marry Miss Castries,"
18610,KIDNAPPED.,he was--being of age and drawing a good income--and woe betide the house
18611,KIDNAPPED.,that would not afterwards receive Mrs. Virginie Saulez Peythroppe with
18612,KIDNAPPED.,the deference due to her husband's rank.
18613,KIDNAPPED.,
18614,KIDNAPPED.,"That was Peythroppe's ultimatum, and any remonstrance drove him frantic."
18615,KIDNAPPED.,
18616,KIDNAPPED.,These sudden madnesses most afflict the sanest men. There was a case
18617,KIDNAPPED.,once--but I will tell you of that later on. You cannot account for the
18618,KIDNAPPED.,"mania, except under a theory directly contradicting the one about the"
18619,KIDNAPPED.,Place wherein marriages are made. Peythroppe was burningly anxious to
18620,KIDNAPPED.,put a millstone round his neck at the outset of his career and argument
18621,KIDNAPPED.,"had not the least effect on him. He was going to marry Miss Castries,"
18622,KIDNAPPED.,and the business was his own business.
18623,KIDNAPPED.,
18624,KIDNAPPED.,He would thank you to keep your advice to yourself. With a man in this
18625,KIDNAPPED.,"condition, mere words only fix him in his purpose. Of course he cannot"
18626,KIDNAPPED.,see that marriage out here does not concern the individual but the
18627,KIDNAPPED.,Government he serves.
18628,KIDNAPPED.,
18629,KIDNAPPED.,Do you remember Mrs. Hauksbee--the most wonderful woman in India? She
18630,KIDNAPPED.,"saved Pluffles from Mrs. Reiver, won Tarrion his appointment in the"
18631,KIDNAPPED.,"Foreign Office, and was defeated in open field by Mrs. Cusack-Bremmil."
18632,KIDNAPPED.,"She heard of the lamentable condition of Peythroppe, and her brain"
18633,KIDNAPPED.,"struck out the plan that saved him. She had the wisdom of the Serpent,"
18634,KIDNAPPED.,"the logical coherence of the Man, the fearlessness of the Child, and"
18635,KIDNAPPED.,"the triple intuition of the Woman. Never--no, never--as long as a tonga"
18636,KIDNAPPED.,"buckets down the Solon dip, or the couples go a-riding at the back of"
18637,KIDNAPPED.,"Summer Hill, will there be such a genius as Mrs. Hauksbee. She attended"
18638,KIDNAPPED.,the consultation of Three Men on Peythroppe's case; and she stood up
18639,KIDNAPPED.,with the lash of her riding-whip between her lips and spake.......
18640,KIDNAPPED.,...
18641,KIDNAPPED.,
18642,KIDNAPPED.,"Three weeks later, Peythroppe dined with the Three Men, and the Gazette"
18643,KIDNAPPED.,of India came in. Peythroppe found to his surprise that he had been
18644,KIDNAPPED.,gazetted a month's leave. Don't ask me how this was managed. I believe
18645,KIDNAPPED.,"firmly that if Mrs. Hauksbee gave the order, the whole Great Indian"
18646,KIDNAPPED.,Administration would stand on its head.
18647,KIDNAPPED.,
18648,KIDNAPPED.,The Three Men had also a month's leave each. Peythroppe put the Gazette
18649,KIDNAPPED.,down and said bad words. Then there came from the compound the soft
18650,KIDNAPPED.,"""pad-pad"" of camels--""thieves' camels,"" the bikaneer breed that don't"
18651,KIDNAPPED.,bubble and howl when they sit down and get up.
18652,KIDNAPPED.,
18653,KIDNAPPED.,After that I don't know what happened. This much is certain.
18654,KIDNAPPED.,
18655,KIDNAPPED.,Peythroppe disappeared--vanished like smoke--and the long foot-rest
18656,KIDNAPPED.,chair in the house of the Three Men was broken to splinters. Also a
18657,KIDNAPPED.,bedstead departed from one of the bedrooms.
18658,KIDNAPPED.,
18659,KIDNAPPED.,Mrs. Hauksbee said that Mr. Peythroppe was shooting in Rajputana with
18660,KIDNAPPED.,the Three Men; so we were compelled to believe her.
18661,KIDNAPPED.,
18662,KIDNAPPED.,"At the end of the month, Peythroppe was gazetted twenty days' extension"
18663,KIDNAPPED.,of leave; but there was wrath and lamentation in the house of Castries.
18664,KIDNAPPED.,"The marriage-day had been fixed, but the bridegroom never came; and the"
18665,KIDNAPPED.,"D'Silvas, Pereiras, and Ducketts lifted their voices and mocked Honorary"
18666,KIDNAPPED.,Lieutenant Castries as one who had been basely imposed upon. Mrs.
18667,KIDNAPPED.,"Hauksbee went to the wedding, and was much astonished when Peythroppe"
18668,KIDNAPPED.,"did not appear. After seven weeks, Peythroppe and the Three Men returned"
18669,KIDNAPPED.,"from Rajputana. Peythroppe was in hard, tough condition, rather white,"
18670,KIDNAPPED.,and more self-contained than ever.
18671,KIDNAPPED.,
18672,KIDNAPPED.,"One of the Three Men had a cut on his nose, cause by the kick of a gun."
18673,KIDNAPPED.,Twelve-bores kick rather curiously.
18674,KIDNAPPED.,
18675,KIDNAPPED.,"Then came Honorary Lieutenant Castries, seeking for the blood of his"
18676,KIDNAPPED.,"perfidious son-in-law to be. He said things--vulgar and ""impossible"""
18677,KIDNAPPED.,"things which showed the raw rough ""ranker"" below the ""Honorary,"" and I"
18678,KIDNAPPED.,"fancy Peythroppe's eyes were opened. Anyhow, he held his peace till the"
18679,KIDNAPPED.,end; when he spoke briefly. Honorary Lieutenant Castries asked for a
18680,KIDNAPPED.,"""peg"" before he went away to die or bring a suit for breach of promise."
18681,KIDNAPPED.,
18682,KIDNAPPED.,Miss Castries was a very good girl. She said that she would have no
18683,KIDNAPPED.,"breach of promise suits. She said that, if she was not a lady, she"
18684,KIDNAPPED.,was refined enough to know that ladies kept their broken hearts to
18685,KIDNAPPED.,"themselves; and, as she ruled her parents, nothing happened. Later on,"
18686,KIDNAPPED.,she married a most respectable and gentlemanly person. He travelled for
18687,KIDNAPPED.,"an enterprising firm in Calcutta, and was all that a good husband should"
18688,KIDNAPPED.,be.
18689,KIDNAPPED.,
18690,KIDNAPPED.,"So Peythroppe came to his right mind again, and did much good work, and"
18691,KIDNAPPED.,was honored by all who knew him. One of these days he will marry; but he
18692,KIDNAPPED.,"will marry a sweet pink-and-white maiden, on the Government House List,"
18693,KIDNAPPED.,"with a little money and some influential connections, as every wise man"
18694,KIDNAPPED.,"should. And he will never, all his life, tell her what happened during"
18695,KIDNAPPED.,the seven weeks of his shooting-tour in Rajputana.
18696,KIDNAPPED.,
18697,KIDNAPPED.,But just think how much trouble and expense--for camel hire is not
18698,KIDNAPPED.,"cheap, and those Bikaneer brutes had to be fed like humans--might have"
18699,KIDNAPPED.,"been saved by a properly conducted Matrimonial Department, under the"
18700,KIDNAPPED.,"control of the Director General of Education, but corresponding direct"
18701,KIDNAPPED.,with the Viceroy.

18724,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18725,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,IF there was one thing on which Golightly prided himself more than
18726,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"another, it was looking like ""an Officer and a gentleman."" He said it"
18727,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,was for the honor of the Service that he attired himself so elaborately;
18728,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,but those who knew him best said that it was just personal vanity. There
18729,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,was no harm about Golightly--not an ounce.
18730,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18731,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"He recognized a horse when he saw one, and could do more than fill a"
18732,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"cantle. He played a very fair game at billiards, and was a sound man at"
18733,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,the whist-table. Everyone liked him; and nobody ever dreamed of seeing
18734,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,him handcuffed on a station platform as a deserter. But this sad thing
18735,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,happened.
18736,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18737,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"He was going down from Dalhousie, at the end of his leave--riding down."
18738,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"He had cut his leave as fine as he dared, and wanted to come down in a"
18739,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,hurry.
18740,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18741,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"It was fairly warm at Dalhousie, and knowing what to expect below, he"
18742,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,descended in a new khaki suit--tight fitting--of a delicate olive-green;
18743,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"a peacock-blue tie, white collar, and a snowy white solah helmet. He"
18744,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,prided himself on looking neat even when he was riding post. He did
18745,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"look neat, and he was so deeply concerned about his appearance before he"
18746,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,started that he quite forgot to take anything but some small change with
18747,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,him. He left all his notes at the hotel. His servants had gone down the
18748,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"road before him, to be ready in waiting at Pathankote with a change of"
18749,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"gear. That was what he called travelling in ""light marching-order."" He"
18750,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,was proud of his faculty of organization--what we call bundobust.
18751,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18752,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Twenty-two miles out of Dalhousie it began to rain--not a mere
18753,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"hill-shower, but a good, tepid monsoonish downpour. Golightly bustled"
18754,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"on, wishing that he had brought an umbrella. The dust on the roads"
18755,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"turned into mud, and the pony mired a good deal. So did Golightly's"
18756,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,khaki gaiters. But he kept on steadily and tried to think how pleasant
18757,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,the coolth was.
18758,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18759,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"His next pony was rather a brute at starting, and Golightly's hands"
18760,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"being slippery with the rain, contrived to get rid of Golightly at a"
18761,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"corner. He chased the animal, caught it, and went ahead briskly."
18762,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18763,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"The spill had not improved his clothes or his temper, and he had lost"
18764,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,one spur. He kept the other one employed. By the time that stage was
18765,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"ended, the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted, and, in spite of"
18766,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"the rain, Golightly was sweating freely. At the end of another miserable"
18767,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"half-hour, Golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy"
18768,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,pulp. The rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solah-topee
18769,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"into an evil-smelling dough, and it had closed on his head like a"
18770,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,half-opened mushroom. Also the green lining was beginning to run.
18771,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18772,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Golightly did not say anything worth recording here. He tore off and
18773,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,squeezed up as much of the brim as was in his eyes and ploughed on. The
18774,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,back of the helmet was flapping on his neck and the sides stuck to
18775,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"his ears, but the leather band and green lining kept things roughly"
18776,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"together, so that the hat did not actually melt away where it flapped."
18777,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18778,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Presently, the pulp and the green stuff made a sort of slimy mildew"
18779,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,which ran over Golightly in several directions--down his back and
18780,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,bosom for choice. The khaki color ran too--it was really shockingly bad
18781,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"dye--and sections of Golightly were brown, and patches were violet,"
18782,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"and contours were ochre, and streaks were ruddy red, and blotches were"
18783,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"nearly white, according to the nature and peculiarities of the dye."
18784,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,When he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face and the green of the
18785,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,hat-lining and the purple stuff that had soaked through on to his neck
18786,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"from the tie became thoroughly mixed, the effect was amazing."
18787,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18788,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Near Dhar the rain stopped and the evening sun came out and dried him up
18789,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"slightly. It fixed the colors, too. Three miles from Pathankote the last"
18790,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"pony fell dead lame, and Golightly was forced to walk. He pushed on"
18791,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,into Pathankote to find his servants. He did not know then that his
18792,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"khitmatgar had stopped by the roadside to get drunk, and would come on"
18793,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,the next day saying that he had sprained his ankle. When he got into
18794,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Pathankote, he couldn't find his servants, his boots were stiff and ropy"
18795,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"with mud, and there were large quantities of dirt about his body. The"
18796,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,blue tie had run as much as the khaki. So he took it off with the collar
18797,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and threw it away. Then he said something about servants generally and
18798,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"tried to get a peg. He paid eight annas for the drink, and this revealed"
18799,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,to him that he had only six annas more in his pocket--or in the world as
18800,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,he stood at that hour.
18801,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18802,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,He went to the Station-Master to negotiate for a first-class ticket to
18803,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Khasa, where he was stationed. The booking-clerk said something to"
18804,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"the Station-Master, the Station-Master said something to the Telegraph"
18805,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Clerk, and the three looked at him with curiosity. They asked him to"
18806,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"wait for half-an-hour, while they telegraphed to Umritsar for"
18807,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"authority. So he waited, and four constables came and grouped themselves"
18808,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,picturesquely round him. Just as he was preparing to ask them to go
18809,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"away, the Station-Master said that he would give the Sahib a ticket"
18810,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"to Umritsar, if the Sahib would kindly come inside the booking-office."
18811,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Golightly stepped inside, and the next thing he knew was that a"
18812,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"constable was attached to each of his legs and arms, while the"
18813,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Station-Master was trying to cram a mailbag over his head.
18814,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18815,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"There was a very fair scuffle all round the booking-office, and"
18816,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Golightly received a nasty cut over his eye through falling against
18817,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"a table. But the constables were too much for him, and they and the"
18818,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Station-Master handcuffed him securely. As soon as the mail-bag was
18819,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"slipped, he began expressing his opinions, and the head-constable"
18820,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"said:--""Without doubt this is the soldier-Englishman we required. Listen"
18821,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"to the abuse!"" Then Golightly asked the Station-Master what the this"
18822,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and the that the proceedings meant. The Station-Master told him he was
18823,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"""Private John Binkle of the----Regiment, 5 ft. 9 in., fair hair, gray"
18824,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"eyes, and a dissipated appearance, no marks on the body,"" who had"
18825,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,deserted a fortnight ago. Golightly began explaining at great length;
18826,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and the more he explained the less the Station-Master believed him. He
18827,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"said that no Lieutenant could look such a ruffian as did Golightly, and"
18828,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,that his instructions were to send his capture under proper escort to
18829,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Umritsar. Golightly was feeling very damp and uncomfortable, and the"
18830,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"language he used was not fit for publication, even in an expurgated"
18831,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"form. The four constables saw him safe to Umritsar in an ""intermediate"""
18832,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"compartment, and he spent the four-hour journey in abusing them as"
18833,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars allowed.
18834,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18835,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,At Umritsar he was bundled out on the platform into the arms of a
18836,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Corporal and two men of the----Regiment. Golightly drew himself up
18837,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and tried to carry off matters jauntily. He did not feel too jaunty in
18838,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"handcuffs, with four constables behind him, and the blood from the"
18839,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,cut on his forehead stiffening on his left cheek. The Corporal was not
18840,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"jocular either. Golightly got as far as--""This is a very absurd mistake,"
18841,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"my men,"" when the Corporal told him to ""stow his lip"" and come along."
18842,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Golightly did not want to come along. He desired to stop and explain.
18843,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"He explained very well indeed, until the Corporal cut in with:--""YOU"
18844,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,a orficer! It's the like o' YOU as brings disgrace on the likes of US.
18845,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Bloom-in' fine orficer you are! I know your regiment. The Rogue's
18846,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,March is the quickstep where you come from. You're a black shame to the
18847,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Service."""
18848,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18849,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Golightly kept his temper, and began explaining all over again from the"
18850,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,beginning. Then he was marched out of the rain into the refreshment-room
18851,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and told not to make a qualified fool of himself.
18852,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18853,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"The men were going to run him up to Fort Govindghar. And ""running up"" is"
18854,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,a performance almost as undignified as the Frog March.
18855,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18856,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,Golightly was nearly hysterical with rage and the chill and the mistake
18857,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and the handcuffs and the headache that the cut on his forehead had
18858,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,given him. He really laid himself out to express what was in his mind.
18859,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"When he had quite finished and his throat was feeling dry, one of the"
18860,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"men said:--""I've 'eard a few beggars in the click blind, stiff and crack"
18861,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"on a bit; but I've never 'eard any one to touch this 'ere 'orficer.'"""
18862,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,They were not angry with him. They rather admired him. They had some
18863,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"beer at the refreshment-room, and offered Golightly some too, because"
18864,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"he had ""swore won'erful."" They asked him to tell them all about the"
18865,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,adventures of Private John Binkle while he was loose on the countryside;
18866,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,and that made Golightly wilder than ever. If he had kept his wits about
18867,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,him he would have kept quiet until an officer came; but he attempted to
18868,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,run.
18869,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18870,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Now the butt of a Martini in the small of your back hurts a great deal,"
18871,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"and rotten, rain-soaked khaki tears easily when two men are jerking at"
18872,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,your collar.
18873,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18874,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Golightly rose from the floor feeling very sick and giddy, with his"
18875,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,shirt ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back.
18876,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18877,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"He yielded to his luck, and at that point the down-train from Lahore"
18878,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,came in carrying one of Golightly's Majors.
18879,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18880,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,This is the Major's evidence in full:--
18881,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,
18882,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"""There was the sound of a scuffle in the second-class refreshment-room,"
18883,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,so I went in and saw the most villainous loafer that I ever set eyes on.
18884,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,His boots and breeches were plastered with mud and beer-stains. He wore
18885,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"a muddy-white dunghill sort of thing on his head, and it hung down in"
18886,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"slips on his shoulders, which were a good deal scratched. He was half in"
18887,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"and half out of a shirt as nearly in two pieces as it could be, and he"
18888,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,was begging the guard to look at the name on the tail of it. As he had
18889,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"rucked the shirt all over his head, I couldn't at first see who he was,"
18890,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,but I fancied that he was a man in the first stage of D. T. from the way
18891,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"he swore while he wrestled with his rags. When he turned round, and I"
18892,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"had made allowance for a lump as big as a pork-pie over one eye, and"
18893,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"some green war-paint on the face, and some violet stripes round the"
18894,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"neck, I saw that it was Golightly. He was very glad to see me,"" said the"
18895,THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY.,"Major, ""and he hoped I would not tell the Mess about it. I didn't, but"

18910,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"From that well-ordered road we tread,"
18911,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,And all the world is wild and strange;
18912,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite
18913,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Shall bear us company tonight,"
18914,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,For we have reached the Oldest Land
18915,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Wherein the Powers of Darkness range.
18916,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,--From the Dusk to the Dawn.
18917,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18918,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"The house of Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two-storied, with four"
18919,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"carved windows of old brown wood, and a flat roof. You may recognize"
18920,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,it by five red hand-prints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the
18921,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"whitewash between the upper windows. Bhagwan Dass, the bunnia, and a"
18922,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"man who says he gets his living by seal-cutting, live in the lower story"
18923,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"with a troop of wives, servants, friends, and retainers. The two upper"
18924,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little black-and-tan
18925,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,terrier that was stolen from an Englishman's house and given to Janoo by
18926,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"a soldier. Today, only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps on"
18927,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the roof generally, except when he sleeps in the street. He used to go"
18928,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"to Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son, who sells curiosities"
18929,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"near the Edwardes' Gate, and then he slept under a real mud roof."
18930,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18931,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Suddhoo is a great friend of mine, because his cousin had a son who"
18932,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"secured, thanks to my recommendation, the post of head-messenger to"
18933,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,a big firm in the Station. Suddhoo says that God will make me a
18934,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. I daresay his prophecy will come
18935,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"true. He is very, very old, with white hair and no teeth worth showing,"
18936,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,and he has outlived his wits--outlived nearly everything except his
18937,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"fondness for his son at Peshawar. Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris,"
18938,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Ladies of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable"
18939,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,profession; but Azizun has since married a medical student from the
18940,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,North-West and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere
18941,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,near Bareilly. Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator. He
18942,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,is very rich. The man who is supposed to get his living by seal-cutting
18943,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,pretends to be very poor.
18944,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18945,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,This lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants
18946,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"in the house of Suddhoo. Then there is Me, of course; but I am only the"
18947,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,chorus that comes in at the end to explain things. So I do not count.
18948,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18949,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Suddhoo was not clever. The man who pretended to cut seals was the
18950,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,cleverest of them all--Bhagwan Dass only knew how to lie--except Janoo.
18951,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"She was also beautiful, but that was her own affair."
18952,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18953,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Suddhoo's son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy, and old Suddhoo"
18954,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,was troubled. The seal-cutter man heard of Suddhoo's anxiety and made
18955,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,capital out of it. He was abreast of the times. He got a friend in
18956,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the son's health.
18957,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18958,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,And here the story begins.
18959,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18960,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Suddhoo's cousin's son told me, one evening, that Suddhoo wanted to see"
18961,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"me; that he was too old and feeble to come personally, and that I should"
18962,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to
18963,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"him. I went; but I think, seeing how well-off Suddhoo was then, that he"
18964,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"might have sent something better than an ekka, which jolted fearfully,"
18965,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,to haul out a future Lieutenant-Governor to the City on a muggy April
18966,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,evening. The ekka did not run quickly.
18967,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18968,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of Ranjit Singh's
18969,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Tomb near the main gate of the Fort. Here was Suddhoo and he said that,"
18970,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"by reason of my condescension, it was absolutely certain that I should"
18971,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,become a Lieutenant-Governor while my hair was yet black. Then we talked
18972,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"about the weather and the state of my health, and the wheat crops, for"
18973,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"fifteen minutes, in the Huzuri Bagh, under the stars."
18974,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18975,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Suddhoo came to the point at last. He said that Janoo had told him that
18976,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"there was an order of the Sirkar against magic, because it was feared"
18977,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,that magic might one day kill the Empress of India. I didn't know
18978,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,anything about the state of the law; but I fancied that something
18979,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,interesting was going to happen. I said that so far from magic being
18980,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,discouraged by the Government it was highly commended.
18981,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
18982,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,The greatest officials of the State practiced it themselves. (If
18983,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the Financial Statement isn't magic, I don't know what is.) Then, to"
18984,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"encourage him further, I said that, if there was any jadoo afoot, I had"
18985,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"not the least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction, and to"
18986,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"seeing that it was clean jadoo--white magic, as distinguished from"
18987,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,the unclean jadoo which kills folk. It took a long time before Suddhoo
18988,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for. Then he
18989,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"told me, in jerks and quavers, that the man who said he cut seals was"
18990,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,a sorcerer of the cleanest kind; that every day he gave Suddhoo news of
18991,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly, and"
18992,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"that this news was always corroborated by the letters. Further, that he"
18993,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"had told Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son, which could"
18994,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"be removed by clean jadoo; and, of course, heavy payment. I began to see"
18995,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"how the land lay, and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo"
18996,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"in the Western line, and would go to his house to see that everything"
18997,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,was done decently and in order. We set off together; and on the way
18998,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Suddhoo told me he had paid the seal-cutter between one hundred and
18999,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,two hundred rupees already; and the jadoo of that night would cost two
19000,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"hundred more. Which was cheap, he said, considering the greatness of his"
19001,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,son's danger; but I do not think he meant it.
19002,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19003,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived. I
19004,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"could hear awful noises from behind the seal-cutter's shop-front, as if"
19005,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"some one were groaning his soul out. Suddhoo shook all over, and while"
19006,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun. Janoo and
19007,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Azizun met us at the stair-head, and told us that the jadoo-work was"
19008,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"coming off in their rooms, because there was more space there. Janoo is"
19009,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,a lady of a freethinking turn of mind. She whispered that the jadoo was
19010,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"an invention to get money out of Suddhoo, and that the seal-cutter would"
19011,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,go to a hot place when he died. Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear
19012,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"and old age. He kept walking up and down the room in the half light,"
19013,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"repeating his son's name over and over again, and asking Azizun if"
19014,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,the seal-cutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own
19015,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,landlord.
19016,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19017,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved
19018,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"bow-windows. The boards were up, and the rooms were only lit by one tiny"
19019,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,lamp. There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still.
19020,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19021,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Presently, the groans below ceased, and we heard steps on the staircase."
19022,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,That was the seal-cutter. He stopped outside the door as the terrier
19023,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain, and he told Suddhoo to blow out"
19024,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the lamp. This left the place in jet darkness, except for the red glow"
19025,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,from the two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun. The seal-cutter
19026,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"came in, and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan."
19027,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Azizun caught her breath, and Janoo backed to one of the beds with a"
19028,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"shudder. There was a clink of something metallic, and then shot up a"
19029,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,pale blue-green flame near the ground. The light was just enough to show
19030,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Azizun, pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between"
19031,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"her knees; Janoo, with her hands clasped, leaning forward as she sat on"
19032,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the bed; Suddhoo, face down, quivering, and the seal-cutter."
19033,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19034,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,I hope I may never see another man like that seal-cutter. He was
19035,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"stripped to the waist, with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my"
19036,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"wrist round his forehead, a salmon-colored loin-cloth round his middle,"
19037,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,and a steel bangle on each ankle. This was not awe-inspiring. It was
19038,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,the face of the man that turned me cold. It was blue-gray in the first
19039,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"place. In the second, the eyes were rolled back till you could only"
19040,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"see the whites of them; and, in the third, the face was the face of"
19041,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"a demon--a ghoul--anything you please except of the sleek, oily old"
19042,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,ruffian who sat in the day-time over his turning-lathe downstairs. He
19043,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"was lying on his stomach, with his arms turned and crossed behind him,"
19044,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,as if he had been thrown down pinioned. His head and neck were the only
19045,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,parts of him off the floor. They were nearly at right angles to the
19046,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"body, like the head of a cobra at spring. It was ghastly. In the centre"
19047,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"of the room, on the bare earth floor, stood a big, deep, brass basin,"
19048,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,with a pale blue-green light floating in the centre like a night-light.
19049,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times. How
19050,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,he did it I do not know. I could see the muscles ripple along his spine
19051,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,and fall smooth again; but I could not see any other motion.
19052,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19053,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"The head seemed the only thing alive about him, except that slow"
19054,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,curl and uncurl of the laboring back-muscles. Janoo from the bed was
19055,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,breathing seventy to the minute; Azizun held her hands before her eyes;
19056,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"and old Suddhoo, fingering at the dirt that had got into his white"
19057,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"beard, was crying to himself. The horror of it was that the creeping,"
19058,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"crawly thing made no sound--only crawled! And, remember, this lasted for"
19059,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"ten minutes, while the terrier whined, and Azizun shuddered, and Janoo"
19060,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"gasped, and Suddhoo cried."
19061,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19062,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"I felt the hair lift at the back of my head, and my heart thump like a"
19063,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"thermantidote paddle. Luckily, the seal-cutter betrayed himself by his"
19064,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,most impressive trick and made me calm again. After he had finished that
19065,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"unspeakable triple crawl, he stretched his head away from the floor as"
19066,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"high as he could, and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils. Now, I"
19067,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,knew how fire-spouting is done--I can do it myself--so I felt at ease.
19068,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,The business was a fraud. If he had only kept to that crawl without
19069,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"trying to raise the effect, goodness knows what I might not have"
19070,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,thought. Both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head
19071,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"dropped, chin down, on the floor with a thud; the whole body lying then"
19072,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,like a corpse with its arms trussed.
19073,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19074,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"There was a pause of five full minutes after this, and the blue-green"
19075,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets, while"
19076,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Azizun turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms.
19077,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to Janoo's huqa, and she slid it"
19078,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"across the floor with her foot. Directly above the body and on the wall,"
19079,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"were a couple of flaming portraits, in stamped paper frames, of the"
19080,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Queen and the Prince of Wales. They looked down on the performance, and,"
19081,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"to my thinking, seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all."
19082,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19083,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Just when the silence was getting unendurable, the body turned over and"
19084,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"rolled away from the basin to the side of the room, where it lay stomach"
19085,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"up. There was a faint ""plop"" from the basin--exactly like the noise"
19086,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,a fish makes when it takes a fly--and the green light in the centre
19087,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,revived.
19088,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19089,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"I looked at the basin, and saw, bobbing in the water, the dried,"
19090,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"shrivelled, black head of a native baby--open eyes, open mouth and"
19091,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"shaved scalp. It was worse, being so very sudden, than the crawling"
19092,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,exhibition. We had no time to say anything before it began to speak.
19093,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19094,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Read Poe's account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man,"
19095,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,and you will realize less than one-half of the horror of that head's
19096,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,voice.
19097,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19098,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"There was an interval of a second or two between each word, and a sort"
19099,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"of ""ring, ring, ring,"" in the note of the voice, like the timbre of a"
19100,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"bell. It pealed slowly, as if talking to itself, for several minutes"
19101,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,before I got rid of my cold sweat. Then the blessed solution struck me.
19102,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"I looked at the body lying near the doorway, and saw, just where the"
19103,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders, a muscle that had nothing"
19104,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"to do with any man's regular breathing, twitching away steadily. The"
19105,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,whole thing was a careful reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that
19106,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,one read about sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a
19107,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear. All this time the head
19108,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"was ""lip-lip-lapping"" against the side of the basin, and speaking. It"
19109,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"told Suddhoo, on his face again whining, of his son's illness and of"
19110,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night. I always
19111,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,shall respect the seal-cutter for keeping so faithfully to the time
19112,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,of the Peshawar telegrams. It went on to say that skilled doctors were
19113,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,night and day watching over the man's life; and that he would eventually
19114,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer, whose servant was the head in"
19115,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the basin, were doubled."
19116,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19117,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in. To ask for
19118,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used
19119,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"when he rose from the dead, is absurd. Janoo, who is really a woman of"
19120,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"masculine intellect, saw this as quickly as I did. I heard her say ""Asli"
19121,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"nahin! Fareib!"" scornfully under her breath; and just as she said so,"
19122,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the light in the basin died out, the head stopped talking, and we heard"
19123,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the room door creak on its hinges. Then Janoo struck a match, lit the"
19124,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"lamp, and we saw that head, basin, and seal-cutter were gone. Suddhoo"
19125,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen,"
19126,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"that, if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it, he could not"
19127,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,raise another two hundred rupees. Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the
19128,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,corner; while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss
19129,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao, or ""make-up."""
19130,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19131,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,I explained as much as I knew of the seal-cutter's way of jadoo; but
19132,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"her argument was much more simple:--""The magic that is always demanding"
19133,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"gifts is no true magic,"" said she. ""My mother told me that the"
19134,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,only potent love-spells are those which are told you for love. This
19135,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"seal-cutter man is a liar and a devil. I dare not tell, do anything, or"
19136,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"get anything done, because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for"
19137,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,two gold rings and a heavy anklet. I must get my food from his shop. The
19138,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"seal-cutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass, and he would poison my food."
19139,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"A fool's jadoo has been going on for ten days, and has cost Suddhoo"
19140,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,many rupees each night. The seal-cutter used black hens and lemons and
19141,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,mantras before. He never showed us anything like this till tonight.
19142,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Azizun is a fool, and will be a purdah nashin soon. Suddhoo has lost"
19143,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,his strength and his wits. See now! I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many
19144,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"rupees while he lived, and many more after his death; and behold, he"
19145,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a she-ass, the"
19146,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"seal-cutter!"""
19147,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19148,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Here I said:--""But what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business?"
19149,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Of course I can speak to the seal-cutter, and he shall refund. The whole"
19150,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"thing is child's talk--shame--and senseless."""
19151,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19152,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"""Suddhoo IS an old child,"" said Janoo. ""He has lived on the roofs these"
19153,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,seventy years and is as senseless as a milch-goat. He brought you here
19154,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar, whose"
19155,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,salt he ate many years ago. He worships the dust off the feet of the
19156,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"seal-cutter, and that cow-devourer has forbidden him to go and see his"
19157,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,son. What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the lightning-post? I have
19158,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below."""
19159,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,
19160,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation;
19161,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner, and Azizun"
19162,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,was trying to guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old mouth.......
19163,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,...

19165,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Now the case stands thus. Unthinkingly, I have laid myself open to the"
19166,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,charge of aiding and abetting the seal-cutter in obtaining money under
19167,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"false pretences, which is forbidden by Section 420 of the Indian Penal"
19168,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Code. I am helpless in the matter for these reasons, I cannot inform"
19169,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,the Police. What witnesses would support my statements? Janoo refuses
19170,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"flatly, Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareilly--lost in this"
19171,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"big India of ours. I cannot again take the law into my own hands, and"
19172,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"speak to the seal-cutter; for certain am I that, not only would Suddhoo"
19173,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"disbelieve me, but this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo, who is"
19174,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia. Suddhoo is an old dotard;
19175,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar rather
19176,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,patronizes the Black Art than otherwise. His son is well now; but
19177,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the seal-cutter, by whose"
19178,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,advice he regulates the affairs of his life. Janoo watches daily the
19179,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,"money that she hoped to wheedle out of Suddhoo taken by the seal-cutter,"
19180,THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO,and becomes daily more furious and sullen.

19201,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Shakespeare says something about worms, or it may be giants or beetles,"
19202,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,turning if you tread on them too severely. The safest plan is never to
19203,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"tread on a worm--not even on the last new subaltern from Home, with his"
19204,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"buttons hardly out of their tissue paper, and the red of sappy English"
19205,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,beef in his cheeks. This is the story of the worm that turned. For
19206,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"the sake of brevity, we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, ""The"
19207,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Worm,"" although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy, without a hair"
19208,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"on his face, and with a waist like a girl's when he came out to the"
19209,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Second ""Shikarris"" and was made unhappy in several ways. The ""Shikarris"""
19210,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"are a high-caste regiment, and you must be able to do things well--play"
19211,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"a banjo or ride more than a little, or sing, or act--to get on with"
19212,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,them.
19213,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19214,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony, and knock chips out of"
19215,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,gate-posts with his trap. Even that became monotonous after a time. He
19216,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"objected to whist, cut the cloth at billiards, sang out of tune, kept"
19217,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"very much to himself, and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home. Four"
19218,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"of these five things were vices which the ""Shikarris"" objected to and"
19219,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"set themselves to eradicate. Every one knows how subalterns are, by"
19220,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"brother subalterns, softened and not permitted to be ferocious. It is"
19221,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"good and wholesome, and does no one any harm, unless tempers are lost;"
19222,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,and then there is trouble. There was a man once--but that is another
19223,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,story.
19224,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19225,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"The ""Shikarris"" shikarred The Worm very much, and he bore everything"
19226,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"without winking. He was so good and so anxious to learn, and flushed"
19227,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"so pink, that his education was cut short, and he was left to his own"
19228,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"devices by every one except the Senior Subaltern, who continued to make"
19229,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,life a burden to The Worm. The Senior Subaltern meant no harm; but his
19230,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"chaff was coarse, and he didn't quite understand where to stop. He had"
19231,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,been waiting too long for his company; and that always sours a man. Also
19232,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"he was in love, which made him worse."
19233,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19234,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"One day, after he had borrowed The Worm's trap for a lady who never"
19235,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"existed, had used it himself all the afternoon, had sent a note to The"
19236,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Worm purporting to come from the lady, and was telling the Mess all"
19237,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"about it, The Worm rose in his place and said, in his quiet, ladylike"
19238,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"voice: ""That was a very pretty sell; but I'll lay you a month's pay to"
19239,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"a month's pay when you get your step, that I work a sell on you that"
19240,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"you'll remember for the rest of your days, and the Regiment after you"
19241,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"when you're dead or broke."" The Worm wasn't angry in the least, and the"
19242,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,rest of the Mess shouted. Then the Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm
19243,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"from the boots upwards, and down again, and said, ""Done, Baby."" The Worm"
19244,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"took the rest of the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken, and"
19245,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,retired into a book with a sweet smile.
19246,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19247,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Two months passed, and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm,"
19248,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,who began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on. I have
19249,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,said that the Senior Subaltern was in love. The curious thing is that
19250,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,a girl was in love with the Senior Subaltern. Though the Colonel said
19251,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"awful things, and the Majors snorted, and married Captains looked"
19252,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"unutterable wisdom, and the juniors scoffed, those two were engaged."
19253,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19254,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his
19255,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm. The girl
19256,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"was a pretty girl, and had money of her own. She does not come into this"
19257,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,story at all.
19258,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19259,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"One night, at the beginning of the hot weather, all the Mess, except The"
19260,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Worm, who had gone to his own room to write Home letters, were sitting"
19261,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"on the platform outside the Mess House. The Band had finished playing,"
19262,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,but no one wanted to go in. And the Captains' wives were there also. The
19263,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,folly of a man in love is unlimited.
19264,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19265,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl
19266,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"he was engaged to, and the ladies were purring approval, while the men"
19267,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"yawned, when there was a rustle of skirts in the dark, and a tired,"
19268,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,faint voice lifted itself:
19269,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19270,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"""Where's my husband?"""
19271,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19272,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the
19273,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"""Shikarris;"" but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had"
19274,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,been shot. Three of them were married men. Perhaps they were afraid that
19275,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,their wives had come from Home unbeknownst. The fourth said that he had
19276,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,acted on the impulse of the moment. He explained this afterwards.
19277,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19278,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Then the voice cried:--""Oh, Lionel!"" Lionel was the Senior Subaltern's"
19279,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,name. A woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on
19280,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"the peg-tables, stretching out her hands to the dark where the Senior"
19281,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Subaltern was, and sobbing. We rose to our feet, feeling that things"
19282,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"were going to happen and ready to believe the worst. In this bad, small"
19283,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"world of ours, one knows so little of the life of the next man--which,"
19284,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"after all, is entirely his own concern--that one is not surprised when"
19285,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,a crash comes. Anything might turn up any day for any one. Perhaps the
19286,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his youth. Men are crippled that
19287,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,way occasionally. We didn't know; we wanted to hear; and the Captains'
19288,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"wives were as anxious as we. If he HAD been trapped, he was to be"
19289,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"excused; for the woman from nowhere, in the dusty shoes, and gray"
19290,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"travelling dress, was very lovely, with black hair and great eyes full"
19291,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"of tears. She was tall, with a fine figure, and her voice had a running"
19292,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"sob in it pitiful to hear. As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up, she"
19293,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"threw her arms round his neck, and called him ""my darling,"" and said she"
19294,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"could not bear waiting alone in England, and his letters were so short"
19295,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"and cold, and she was his to the end of the world, and would he forgive"
19296,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,her. This did not sound quite like a lady's way of speaking. It was too
19297,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,demonstrative.
19298,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19299,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Things seemed black indeed, and the Captains' wives peered under their"
19300,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern, and the Colonel's face set like the"
19301,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Day of Judgment framed in gray bristles, and no one spoke for a while."
19302,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19303,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Next the Colonel said, very shortly:--""Well, Sir?"" and the woman sobbed"
19304,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,afresh. The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round his
19305,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"neck, but he gasped out:--""It's a d----d lie! I never had a wife in my"
19306,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"life!"" ""Don't swear,"" said the Colonel. ""Come into the Mess. We must"
19307,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"sift this clear somehow,"" and he sighed to himself, for he believed in"
19308,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"his ""Shikarris,"" did the Colonel."
19309,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19310,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"We trooped into the ante-room, under the full lights, and there we"
19311,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"saw how beautiful the woman was. She stood up in the middle of us all,"
19312,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"sometimes choking with crying, then hard and proud, and then holding"
19313,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,out her arms to the Senior Subaltern. It was like the fourth act of a
19314,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,tragedy. She told us how the Senior Subaltern had married her when he
19315,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,was Home on leave eighteen months before; and she seemed to know all
19316,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"that we knew, and more too, of his people and his past life. He was"
19317,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"white and ashy gray, trying now and again to break into the torrent"
19318,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"of her words; and we, noting how lovely she was and what a criminal he"
19319,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"looked, esteemed him a beast of the worst kind. We felt sorry for him,"
19320,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,though.
19321,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19322,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife.
19323,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Nor will he. It was so sudden, rushing out of the dark, unannounced,"
19324,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,into our dull lives. The Captains' wives stood back; but their eyes were
19325,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"alight, and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced"
19326,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,the Senior Subaltern. The Colonel seemed five years older. One Major was
19327,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath
19328,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,it. Another was chewing his moustache and smiling quietly as if he
19329,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"were witnessing a play. Full in the open space in the centre, by the"
19330,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"whist-tables, the Senior Subaltern's terrier was hunting for fleas. I"
19331,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand.
19332,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,I remember the look of horror on the Senior Subaltern's face. It was
19333,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"rather like seeing a man hanged; but much more interesting. Finally, the"
19334,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F.
19335,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"M. in tattoo on his left shoulder. We all knew that, and to our innocent"
19336,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,minds it seemed to clinch the matter. But one of the Bachelor Majors
19337,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"said very politely:--""I presume that your marriage certificate would be"
19338,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"more to the purpose?"""
19339,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19340,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,That roused the woman. She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern
19341,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"for a cur, and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest."
19342,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Then she wept, and then she pulled a paper from her breast, saying"
19343,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"imperially:--""Take that! And let my husband--my lawfully wedded"
19344,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"husband--read it aloud--if he dare!"""
19345,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19346,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"There was a hush, and the men looked into each other's eyes as the"
19347,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way, and took the"
19348,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"paper. We were wondering as we stared, whether there was anything"
19349,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,against any one of us that might turn up later on. The Senior
19350,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Subaltern's throat was dry; but, as he ran his eye over the paper, he"
19351,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief, and said to the woman:--""You"
19352,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"young blackguard!"""
19353,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19354,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"But the woman had fled through a door, and on the paper was"
19355,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"written:--""This is to certify that I, The Worm, have paid in full my"
19356,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"debts to the Senior Subaltern, and, further, that the Senior Subaltern"
19357,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"is my debtor, by agreement on the 23d of February, as by the Mess"
19358,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"attested, to the extent of one month's Captain's pay, in the lawful"
19359,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"currency of the India Empire."""
19360,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19361,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Then a deputation set off for The Worm's quarters and found him, betwixt"
19362,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"and between, unlacing his stays, with the hat, wig, serge dress, etc.,"
19363,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"on the bed. He came over as he was, and the ""Shikarris"" shouted till the"
19364,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,Gunners' Mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun. I
19365,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"think we were all, except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern, a little"
19366,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing. But that is human
19367,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,nature. There could be no two words about The Worm's acting. It leaned
19368,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can. When
19369,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,most of the Subalterns sat upon him with sofa-cushions to find out
19370,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"why he had not said that acting was his strong point, he answered very"
19371,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"quietly:--""I don't think you ever asked me. I used to act at Home with"
19372,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"my sisters."" But no acting with girls could account for The Worm's"
19373,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"display that night. Personally, I think it was in bad taste."
19374,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19375,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Besides being dangerous. There is no sort of use in playing with fire,"
19376,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,even for fun.
19377,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19378,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"The ""Shikarris"" made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club; and,"
19379,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt, which he did at once, The"
19380,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,Worm sank the money in scenery and dresses. He was a good Worm; and
19381,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"the ""Shikarris"" are proud of him. The only drawback is that he has been"
19382,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"christened ""Mrs. Senior Subaltern;"" and as there are now two Mrs. Senior"
19383,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Subalterns in the Station, this is sometimes confusing to strangers."
19384,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,
19385,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,"Later on, I will tell you of a case something like, this, but with all"
19386,HIS WEDDED WIFE.,the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble.

19433,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,was that horse. Two miles was his own particular distance. He trained

19452,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"the straight, the track passes close to a couple of old brick-mounds"
19453,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,enclosing a funnel-shaped hollow. The big end of the funnel is not six
19454,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,feet from the railings on the off-side. The astounding peculiarity of
19455,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"the course is that, if you stand at one particular place, about half a"
19456,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"mile away, inside the course, and speak at an ordinary pitch, your voice"
19457,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,just hits the funnel of the brick-mounds and makes a curious whining
19458,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,echo there. A man discovered this one morning by accident while out
19459,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,training with a friend. He marked the place to stand and speak from
19460,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"with a couple of bricks, and he kept his knowledge to himself. EVERY"
19461,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,peculiarity of a course is worth remembering in a country where rats
19462,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"play the mischief with the elephant-litter, and Stewards build jumps to"
19463,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,suit their own stables.
19464,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19465,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"This man ran a very fairish country-bred, a long, racking high mare"
19466,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"with the temper of a fiend, and the paces of an airy wandering seraph--a"
19467,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"drifty, glidy stretch. The mare was, as a delicate tribute to Mrs."
19468,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Reiver, called ""The Lady Regula Baddun""--or for short, Regula Baddun."
19469,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19470,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Shackles' jockey, Brunt, was a quiet, well-behaved boy, but his nerves"
19471,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"had been shaken. He began his career by riding jump-races in Melbourne,"
19472,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"where a few Stewards want lynching, and was one of the jockeys who"
19473,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,came through the awful butchery--perhaps you will recollect it--of the
19474,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,Maribyrnong Plate. The walls were colonial ramparts--logs of jarrak
19475,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,spiked into masonry--with wings as strong as Church buttresses. Once
19476,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"in his stride, a horse had to jump or fall. He couldn't run out. In the"
19477,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Maribyrnong Plate, twelve horses were jammed at the second wall. Red"
19478,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Hat, leading, fell this side, and threw out The Glen, and the ruck"
19479,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling,"
19480,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"screaming, kicking shambles. Four jockeys were taken out dead; three"
19481,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"were very badly hurt, and Brunt was among the three. He told the story"
19482,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,of the Maribyrnong Plate sometimes; and when he described how Whalley
19483,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"on Red Hat, said, as the mare fell under him:--""God ha' mercy, I'm done"
19484,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"for!"" and how, next instant, Sithee There and White Otter had crushed"
19485,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"the life out of poor Whalley, and the dust hid a small hell of men and"
19486,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"horses, no one marvelled that Brunt had dropped jump-races and Australia"
19487,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,together. Regula Baddun's owner knew that story by heart. Brunt never
19488,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,varied it in the telling. He had no education.
19489,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19490,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Shackles came to the Chedputter Autumn races one year, and his owner"
19491,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"walked about insulting the sportsmen of Chedputter generally, till"
19492,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"they went to the Honorary Secretary in a body and said:--""Appoint"
19493,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Handicappers, and arrange a race which shall break Shackles and humble"
19494,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"the pride of his owner."" The Districts rose against Shackles and sent"
19495,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"up of their best; Ousel, who was supposed to be able to do his mile in"
19496,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"1-53; Petard, the stud-bred, trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how"
19497,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"to train; Gringalet, the ewe-lamb of the 75th; Bobolink, the pride of"
19498,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,Peshawar; and many others.
19499,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19500,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"They called that race The Broken-Link Handicap, because it was to smash"
19501,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Shackles; and the Handicappers piled on the weights, and the Fund gave"
19502,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"eight hundred rupees, and the distance was ""round the course for all"
19503,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"horses."" Shackles' owner said:--""You can arrange the race with regard"
19504,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"to Shackles only. So long as you don't bury him under weight-cloths,"
19505,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"I don't mind."" Regula Baddun's owner said:--""I throw in my mare to fret"
19506,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Ousel. Six furlongs is Regula's distance, and she will then lie down"
19507,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"and die. So also will Ousel, for his jockey doesn't understand a waiting"
19508,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"race."" Now, this was a lie, for Regula had been in work for two months"
19509,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"at Dehra, and her chances were good, always supposing that Shackles"
19510,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,broke a blood-vessel--OR BRUNT MOVED ON HIM.
19511,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19512,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,The plunging in the lotteries was fine. They filled eight thousand rupee
19513,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"lotteries on the Broken Link Handicap, and the account in the Pioneer"
19514,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"said that ""favoritism was divided."" In plain English, the various"
19515,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,contingents were wild on their respective horses; for the Handicappers
19516,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,had done their work well. The Honorary Secretary shouted himself hoarse
19517,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"through the din; and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke, and"
19518,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,the rattling of the dice-boxes like the rattle of small-arm fire.
19519,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19520,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,Ten horses started--very level--and Regula Baddun's owner cantered out
19521,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"on his back to a place inside the circle of the course, where two bricks"
19522,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,had been thrown. He faced towards the brick-mounds at the lower end of
19523,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,the course and waited.
19524,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19525,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"he story of the running is in the Pioneer. At the end of the first mile,"
19526,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"Shackles crept out of the ruck, well on the outside, ready to get round"
19527,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"the turn, lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the"
19528,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"others knew he had got away. Brunt was sitting still, perfectly happy,"
19529,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"listening to the ""drum, drum, drum"" of the hoofs behind, and knowing"
19530,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"that, in about twenty strides, Shackles would draw one deep breath and"
19531,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"go up the last half-mile like the ""Flying Dutchman."" As Shackles went"
19532,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"short to take the turn and came abreast of the brick-mound, Brunt heard,"
19533,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"above the noise of the wind in his ears, a whining, wailing voice on the"
19534,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"offside, saying:--""God ha' mercy, I'm done for!"" In one stride, Brunt"
19535,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"saw the whole seething smash of the Maribyrnong Plate before him,"
19536,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,started in his saddle and gave a yell of terror. The start brought the
19537,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"heels into Shackles' side, and the scream hurt Shackles' feelings. He"
19538,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,couldn't stop dead; but he put out his feet and slid along for fifty
19539,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"yards, and then, very gravely and judicially, bucked off Brunt--a"
19540,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"shaking, terror-stricken lump, while Regula Baddun made a neck-and-neck"
19541,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"race with Bobolink up the straight, and won by a short head--Petard"
19542,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"a bad third. Shackles' owner, in the Stand, tried to think that his"
19543,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"field-glasses had gone wrong. Regula Baddun's owner, waiting by the two"
19544,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"bricks, gave one deep sigh of relief, and cantered back to the stand. He"
19545,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"had won, in lotteries and bets, about fifteen thousand."
19546,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19547,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,It was a broken-link Handicap with a vengeance. It broke nearly all the
19548,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"men concerned, and nearly broke the heart of Shackles' owner."
19549,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19550,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"He went down to interview Brunt. The boy lay, livid and gasping with"
19551,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"fright, where he had tumbled off. The sin of losing the race never"
19552,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"seemed to strike him. All he knew was that Whalley had ""called"" him,"
19553,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"that the ""call"" was a warning; and, were he cut in two for it, he would"
19554,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"never get up again. His nerve had gone altogether, and he only asked"
19555,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"his master to give him a good thrashing, and let him go. He was fit for"
19556,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"nothing, he said. He got his dismissal, and crept up to the paddock,"
19557,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"white as chalk, with blue lips, his knees giving way under him. People"
19558,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,said nasty things in the paddock; but Brunt never heeded. He changed
19559,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"into tweeds, took his stick and went down the road, still shaking with"
19560,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"fright, and muttering over and over again:--""God ha' mercy, I'm done"
19561,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"for!"" To the best of my knowledge and belief he spoke the truth."
19562,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,
19563,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,So now you know how the Broken-Link Handicap was run and won. Of course
19564,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,you don't believe it. You would credit anything about Russia's designs
19565,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,"on India, or the recommendations of the Currency Commission; but a"
19566,THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED.,little bit of sober fact is more than you can stand!

19581,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19582,BEYOND THE PALE.,This is the story of a man who wilfully stepped beyond the safe limits
19583,BEYOND THE PALE.,"of decent every-day society, and paid for it heavily."
19584,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19585,BEYOND THE PALE.,He knew too much in the first instance; and he saw too much in the
19586,BEYOND THE PALE.,second. He took too deep an interest in native life; but he will never
19587,BEYOND THE PALE.,do so again.
19588,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19589,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Deep away in the heart of the City, behind Jitha Megji's bustee, lies"
19590,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Amir Nath's Gully, which ends in a dead-wall pierced by one grated"
19591,BEYOND THE PALE.,"window. At the head of the Gully is a big cow-byre, and the walls on"
19592,BEYOND THE PALE.,either side of the Gully are without windows. Neither Suchet Singh nor
19593,BEYOND THE PALE.,Gaur Chand approved of their women-folk looking into the world. If
19594,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Durga Charan had been of their opinion, he would have been a happier man"
19595,BEYOND THE PALE.,"today, and little Bisesa would have been able to knead her own bread."
19596,BEYOND THE PALE.,Her room looked out through the grated window into the narrow dark Gully
19597,BEYOND THE PALE.,where the sun never came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue
19598,BEYOND THE PALE.,"slime. She was a widow, about fifteen years old, and she prayed the"
19599,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Gods, day and night, to send her a lover; for she did not approve of"
19600,BEYOND THE PALE.,living alone.
19601,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19602,BEYOND THE PALE.,One day the man--Trejago his name was--came into Amir Nath's Gully on an
19603,BEYOND THE PALE.,"aimless wandering; and, after he had passed the buffaloes, stumbled over"
19604,BEYOND THE PALE.,a big heap of cattle food.
19605,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19606,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Then he saw that the Gully ended in a trap, and heard a little laugh"
19607,BEYOND THE PALE.,"from behind the grated window. It was a pretty little laugh, and"
19608,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Trejago, knowing that, for all practical purposes, the old Arabian"
19609,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Nights are good guides, went forward to the window, and whispered that"
19610,BEYOND THE PALE.,"verse of ""The Love Song of Har Dyal"" which begins:"
19611,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19612,BEYOND THE PALE.,Can a man stand upright in the face of the naked Sun;
19613,BEYOND THE PALE.,or a Lover in the Presence of his Beloved?
19614,BEYOND THE PALE.,"If my feet fail me, O Heart of my Heart, am I to blame,"
19615,BEYOND THE PALE.,being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty?
19616,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19617,BEYOND THE PALE.,There came the faint tchinks of a woman's bracelets from behind the
19618,BEYOND THE PALE.,"grating, and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse:"
19619,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19620,BEYOND THE PALE.,Alas! alas! Can the Moon tell the Lotus of her love when the
19621,BEYOND THE PALE.,Gate of Heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains?
19622,BEYOND THE PALE.,"They have taken my Beloved, and driven her with the pack-horses"
19623,BEYOND THE PALE.,to the North.
19624,BEYOND THE PALE.,There are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart.
19625,BEYOND THE PALE.,Call to the bowman to make ready--
19626,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19627,BEYOND THE PALE.,"The voice stopped suddenly, and Trejago walked out of Amir Nath's Gully,"
19628,BEYOND THE PALE.,"wondering who in the world could have capped ""The Love Song of Har Dyal"""
19629,BEYOND THE PALE.,so neatly.
19630,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19631,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Next morning, as he was driving to the office, an old woman threw a"
19632,BEYOND THE PALE.,packet into his dog-cart. In the packet was the half of a broken
19633,BEYOND THE PALE.,"glass bangle, one flower of the blood red dhak, a pinch of bhusa or"
19634,BEYOND THE PALE.,"cattle-food, and eleven cardamoms. That packet was a letter--not a"
19635,BEYOND THE PALE.,"clumsy compromising letter, but an innocent, unintelligible lover's"
19636,BEYOND THE PALE.,epistle.
19637,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19638,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Trejago knew far too much about these things, as I have said. No"
19639,BEYOND THE PALE.,Englishman should be able to translate object-letters. But Trejago
19640,BEYOND THE PALE.,spread all the trifles on the lid of his office-box and began to puzzle
19641,BEYOND THE PALE.,them out.
19642,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19643,BEYOND THE PALE.,"A broken glass-bangle stands for a Hindu widow all India over; because,"
19644,BEYOND THE PALE.,when her husband dies a woman's bracelets are broken on her wrists.
19645,BEYOND THE PALE.,Trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass.
19646,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19647,BEYOND THE PALE.,"The flower of the dhak means diversely ""desire,"" ""come,"" ""write,"" or"
19648,BEYOND THE PALE.,"""danger,"" according to the other things with it. One cardamom means"
19649,BEYOND THE PALE.,"""jealousy;"" but when any article is duplicated in an object-letter,"
19650,BEYOND THE PALE.,it loses its symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number
19651,BEYOND THE PALE.,"indicating time, or, if incense, curds, or saffron be sent also,"
19652,BEYOND THE PALE.,"place. The message ran then:--""A widow dhak flower and bhusa--at eleven"
19653,BEYOND THE PALE.,"o'clock."" The pinch of bhusa enlightened Trejago. He saw--this kind of"
19654,BEYOND THE PALE.,letter leaves much to instinctive knowledge--that the bhusa referred
19655,BEYOND THE PALE.,to the big heap of cattle-food over which he had fallen in Amir Nath's
19656,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Gully, and that the message must come from the person behind the"
19657,BEYOND THE PALE.,"grating; she being a widow. So the message ran then:--""A widow, in"
19658,BEYOND THE PALE.,"the Gully in which is the heap of bhusa, desires you to come at eleven"
19659,BEYOND THE PALE.,"o'clock."""
19660,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19661,BEYOND THE PALE.,Trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed. He knew
19662,BEYOND THE PALE.,that men in the East do not make love under windows at eleven in the
19663,BEYOND THE PALE.,"forenoon, nor do women fix appointments a week in advance."
19664,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19665,BEYOND THE PALE.,"So he went, that very night at eleven, into Amir Nath's Gully, clad in a"
19666,BEYOND THE PALE.,"boorka, which cloaks a man as well as a woman. Directly the gongs in"
19667,BEYOND THE PALE.,"the City made the hour, the little voice behind the grating took up ""The"
19668,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Love Song of Har Dyal"" at the verse where the Panthan girl calls upon"
19669,BEYOND THE PALE.,Har Dyal to return. The song is really pretty in the Vernacular. In
19670,BEYOND THE PALE.,English you miss the wail of it. It runs something like this:--
19671,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19672,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Alone upon the housetops, to the North"
19673,BEYOND THE PALE.,"I turn and watch the lightning in the sky,--"
19674,BEYOND THE PALE.,"The glamour of thy footsteps in the North,"
19675,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!"
19676,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19677,BEYOND THE PALE.,Below my feet the still bazar is laid
19678,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Far, far below the weary camels lie,--"
19679,BEYOND THE PALE.,"The camels and the captives of thy raid,"
19680,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!"
19681,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19682,BEYOND THE PALE.,"My father's wife is old and harsh with years,"
19683,BEYOND THE PALE.,And drudge of all my father's house am I.--
19684,BEYOND THE PALE.,"My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears,"
19685,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!"
19686,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19687,BEYOND THE PALE.,"As the song stopped, Trejago stepped up under the grating and"
19688,BEYOND THE PALE.,"whispered:--""I am here."""
19689,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19690,BEYOND THE PALE.,Bisesa was good to look upon.
19691,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19692,BEYOND THE PALE.,"That night was the beginning of many strange things, and of a double"
19693,BEYOND THE PALE.,life so wild that Trejago today sometimes wonders if it were not all a
19694,BEYOND THE PALE.,dream. Bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the object-letter had
19695,BEYOND THE PALE.,detached the heavy grating from the brick-work of the wall; so that the
19696,BEYOND THE PALE.,"window slid inside, leaving only a square of raw masonry, into which an"
19697,BEYOND THE PALE.,active man might climb.
19698,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19699,BEYOND THE PALE.,"In the day-time, Trejago drove through his routine of office-work, or"
19700,BEYOND THE PALE.,put on his calling-clothes and called on the ladies of the Station;
19701,BEYOND THE PALE.,wondering how long they would know him if they knew of poor little
19702,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Bisesa. At night, when all the City was still, came the walk under the"
19703,BEYOND THE PALE.,"evil-smelling boorka, the patrol through Jitha Megji's bustee, the quick"
19704,BEYOND THE PALE.,turn into Amir Nath's Gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead
19705,BEYOND THE PALE.,"walls, and then, last of all, Bisesa, and the deep, even breathing of"
19706,BEYOND THE PALE.,the old woman who slept outside the door of the bare little room that
19707,BEYOND THE PALE.,Durga Charan allotted to his sister's daughter. Who or what Durga Charan
19708,BEYOND THE PALE.,"was, Trejago never inquired; and why in the world he was not discovered"
19709,BEYOND THE PALE.,"and knifed never occurred to him till his madness was over, and Bisesa..."
19710,BEYOND THE PALE.,But this comes later.
19711,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19712,BEYOND THE PALE.,Bisesa was an endless delight to Trejago. She was as ignorant as a bird;
19713,BEYOND THE PALE.,and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had
19714,BEYOND THE PALE.,"reached her in her room, amused Trejago almost as much as her lisping"
19715,BEYOND THE PALE.,"attempts to pronounce his name--""Christopher."" The first syllable was"
19716,BEYOND THE PALE.,"always more than she could manage, and she made funny little gestures"
19717,BEYOND THE PALE.,"with her rose-leaf hands, as one throwing the name away, and then,"
19718,BEYOND THE PALE.,"kneeling before Trejago, asked him, exactly as an Englishwoman would do,"
19719,BEYOND THE PALE.,if he were sure he loved her. Trejago swore that he loved her more than
19720,BEYOND THE PALE.,any one else in the world. Which was true.
19721,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19722,BEYOND THE PALE.,"After a month of this folly, the exigencies of his other life compelled"
19723,BEYOND THE PALE.,Trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance. You
19724,BEYOND THE PALE.,may take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed
19725,BEYOND THE PALE.,"and discussed by a man's own race, but by some hundred and fifty natives"
19726,BEYOND THE PALE.,as well. Trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the
19727,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Band-stand, and once or twice to drive with her; never for an instant"
19728,BEYOND THE PALE.,dreaming that this would affect his dearer out-of-the-way life. But the
19729,BEYOND THE PALE.,"news flew, in the usual mysterious fashion, from mouth to mouth, till"
19730,BEYOND THE PALE.,Bisesa's duenna heard of it and told Bisesa. The child was so troubled
19731,BEYOND THE PALE.,"that she did the household work evilly, and was beaten by Durga Charan's"
19732,BEYOND THE PALE.,wife in consequence.
19733,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19734,BEYOND THE PALE.,"A week later, Bisesa taxed Trejago with the flirtation. She understood"
19735,BEYOND THE PALE.,no gradations and spoke openly. Trejago laughed and Bisesa stamped her
19736,BEYOND THE PALE.,"little feet--little feet, light as marigold flowers, that could lie in"
19737,BEYOND THE PALE.,the palm of a man's one hand.
19738,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19739,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Much that is written about ""Oriental passion and impulsiveness"" is"
19740,BEYOND THE PALE.,"exaggerated and compiled at second-hand, but a little of it is true; and"
19741,BEYOND THE PALE.,"when an Englishman finds that little, it is quite as startling as any"
19742,BEYOND THE PALE.,"passion in his own proper life. Bisesa raged and stormed, and finally"
19743,BEYOND THE PALE.,threatened to kill herself if Trejago did not at once drop the alien
19744,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Memsahib who had come between them. Trejago tried to explain, and"
19745,BEYOND THE PALE.,to show her that she did not understand these things from a Western
19746,BEYOND THE PALE.,"standpoint. Bisesa drew herself up, and said simply:"
19747,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19748,BEYOND THE PALE.,"""I do not. I know only this--it is not good that I should have made you"
19749,BEYOND THE PALE.,"dearer than my own heart to me, Sahib. You are an Englishman."
19750,BEYOND THE PALE.,"I am only a black girl""--she was fairer than bar-gold in the Mint--and"
19751,BEYOND THE PALE.,the widow of a black man.
19752,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19753,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Then she sobbed and said: ""But on my soul and my Mother's soul, I love"
19754,BEYOND THE PALE.,"you. There shall no harm come to you, whatever happens to me."""
19755,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19756,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Trejago argued with the child, and tried to soothe her, but she seemed"
19757,BEYOND THE PALE.,quite unreasonably disturbed. Nothing would satisfy her save that all
19758,BEYOND THE PALE.,relations between them should end. He was to go away at once. And he
19759,BEYOND THE PALE.,"went. As he dropped out at the window, she kissed his forehead twice,"
19760,BEYOND THE PALE.,and he walked away wondering.
19761,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19762,BEYOND THE PALE.,"A week, and then three weeks, passed without a sign from Bisesa."
19763,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19764,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Trejago, thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough, went"
19765,BEYOND THE PALE.,"down to Amir Nath's Gully for the fifth time in the three weeks, hoping"
19766,BEYOND THE PALE.,that his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered. He
19767,BEYOND THE PALE.,was not disappointed.
19768,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19769,BEYOND THE PALE.,"There was a young moon, and one stream of light fell down into Amir"
19770,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Nath's Gully, and struck the grating, which was drawn away as he"
19771,BEYOND THE PALE.,"knocked. From the black dark, Bisesa held out her arms into the"
19772,BEYOND THE PALE.,"moonlight. Both hands had been cut off at the wrists, and the stumps"
19773,BEYOND THE PALE.,were nearly healed.
19774,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19775,BEYOND THE PALE.,"Then, as Bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed, some one in"
19776,BEYOND THE PALE.,"the room grunted like a wild beast, and something sharp--knife, sword or"
19777,BEYOND THE PALE.,"spear--thrust at Trejago in his boorka. The stroke missed his body, but"
19778,BEYOND THE PALE.,"cut into one of the muscles of the groin, and he limped slightly from"
19779,BEYOND THE PALE.,the wound for the rest of his days.
19780,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19781,BEYOND THE PALE.,The grating went into its place. There was no sign whatever from inside
19782,BEYOND THE PALE.,"the house--nothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall, and the"
19783,BEYOND THE PALE.,blackness of Amir Nath's Gully behind.
19784,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19785,BEYOND THE PALE.,"The next thing Trejago remembers, after raging and shouting like a"
19786,BEYOND THE PALE.,"madman between those pitiless walls, is that he found himself near the"
19787,BEYOND THE PALE.,"river as the dawn was breaking, threw away his boorka and went home"
19788,BEYOND THE PALE.,bareheaded.
19789,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19790,BEYOND THE PALE.,"What the tragedy was--whether Bisesa had, in a fit of causeless despair,"
19791,BEYOND THE PALE.,"told everything, or the intrigue had been discovered and she tortured"
19792,BEYOND THE PALE.,"to tell, whether Durga Charan knew his name, and what became of"
19793,BEYOND THE PALE.,Bisesa--Trejago does not know to this day. Something horrible had
19794,BEYOND THE PALE.,"happened, and the thought of what it must have been comes upon Trejago"
19795,BEYOND THE PALE.,"in the night now and again, and keeps him company till the morning."
19796,BEYOND THE PALE.,One special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the
19797,BEYOND THE PALE.,front of Durga Charan's house. It may open on to a courtyard common to
19798,BEYOND THE PALE.,"two or more houses, or it may lie behind any one of the gates of Jitha"
19799,BEYOND THE PALE.,Megji's bustee. Trejago cannot tell.
19800,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19801,BEYOND THE PALE.,He cannot get Bisesa--poor little Bisesa--back again. He has lost her in
19802,BEYOND THE PALE.,"the City, where each man's house is as guarded and as unknowable as the"
19803,BEYOND THE PALE.,grave; and the grating that opens into Amir Nath's Gully has been walled
19804,BEYOND THE PALE.,up.
19805,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19806,BEYOND THE PALE.,"But Trejago pays his calls regularly, and is reckoned a very decent sort"
19807,BEYOND THE PALE.,of man.
19808,BEYOND THE PALE.,
19809,BEYOND THE PALE.,"There is nothing peculiar about him, except a slight stiffness, caused"

19826,IN ERROR.,There is hope for a man who gets publicly and riotously drunk more
19827,IN ERROR.,often that he ought to do; but there is no hope for the man who drinks
19828,IN ERROR.,secretly and alone in his own house--the man who is never seen to drink.
19829,IN ERROR.,
19830,IN ERROR.,This is a rule; so there must be an exception to prove it.
19831,IN ERROR.,
19832,IN ERROR.,Moriarty's case was that exception.
19833,IN ERROR.,
19834,IN ERROR.,"He was a Civil Engineer, and the Government, very kindly, put him quite"
19835,IN ERROR.,"by himself in an out-district, with nobody but natives to talk to and a"
19836,IN ERROR.,great deal of work to do. He did his work well in the four years he
19837,IN ERROR.,was utterly alone; but he picked up the vice of secret and solitary
19838,IN ERROR.,"drinking, and came up out of the wilderness more old and worn and"
19839,IN ERROR.,haggard than the dead-alive life had any right to make him.
19840,IN ERROR.,
19841,IN ERROR.,You know the saying that a man who has been alone in the jungle for
19842,IN ERROR.,more than a year is never quite sane all his life after. People credited
19843,IN ERROR.,"Moriarty's queerness of manner and moody ways to the solitude, and said"
19844,IN ERROR.,it showed how Government spoilt the futures of its best men.
19845,IN ERROR.,Moriarty had built himself the plinth of a very god reputation in the
19846,IN ERROR.,"bridge-dam-girder line. But he knew, every night of the week, that"
19847,IN ERROR.,he was taking steps to undermine that reputation with L. L. L. and
19848,IN ERROR.,"""Christopher"" and little nips of liqueurs, and filth of that kind. He"
19849,IN ERROR.,"had a sound constitution and a great brain, or else he would have broken"
19850,IN ERROR.,"down and died like a sick camel in the district, as better men have done"
19851,IN ERROR.,before him.
19852,IN ERROR.,
19853,IN ERROR.,Government ordered him to Simla after he had come out of the desert;
19854,IN ERROR.,"and he went up meaning to try for a post then vacant. That season, Mrs."
19855,IN ERROR.,"Reiver--perhaps you will remember her--was in the height of her power,"
19856,IN ERROR.,and many men lay under her yoke. Everything bad that could be said has
19857,IN ERROR.,"already been said about Mrs. Reiver, in another tale."
19858,IN ERROR.,
19859,IN ERROR.,"Moriarty was heavily-built and handsome, very quiet and nervously"
19860,IN ERROR.,anxious to please his neighbors when he wasn't sunk in a brown study.
19861,IN ERROR.,He started a good deal at sudden noises or if spoken to without warning;
19862,IN ERROR.,"and, when you watched him drinking his glass of water at dinner,"
19863,IN ERROR.,you could see the hand shake a little. But all this was put down to
19864,IN ERROR.,"nervousness, and the quiet, steady, ""sip-sip-sip, fill and sip-sip-sip,"
19865,IN ERROR.,"again,"" that went on in his own room when he was by himself, was never"
19866,IN ERROR.,"known. Which was miraculous, seeing how everything in a man's private"
19867,IN ERROR.,life is public property out here.
19868,IN ERROR.,
19869,IN ERROR.,"Moriarty was drawn, not into Mrs. Reiver's set, because they were not"
19870,IN ERROR.,"his sort, but into the power of Mrs. Reiver, and he fell down in front"
19871,IN ERROR.,of her and made a goddess of her. This was due to his coming fresh out
19872,IN ERROR.,of the jungle to a big town. He could not scale things properly or see
19873,IN ERROR.,who was what.
19874,IN ERROR.,
19875,IN ERROR.,"Because Mrs. Reiver was cold and hard, he said she was stately and"
19876,IN ERROR.,"dignified. Because she had no brains, and could not talk cleverly, he"
19877,IN ERROR.,said she was reserved and shy. Mrs. Reiver shy! Because she was unworthy
19878,IN ERROR.,"of honor or reverence from any one, he reverenced her from a distance"
19879,IN ERROR.,and dowered her with all the virtues in the Bible and most of those in
19880,IN ERROR.,Shakespeare.
19881,IN ERROR.,
19882,IN ERROR.,"This big, dark, abstracted man who was so nervous when a pony cantered"
19883,IN ERROR.,"behind him, used to moon in the train of Mrs. Reiver, blushing with"
19884,IN ERROR.,pleasure when she threw a word or two his way. His admiration was
19885,IN ERROR.,strictly platonic: even other women saw and admitted this. He did not
19886,IN ERROR.,"move out in Simla, so he heard nothing against his idol: which was"
19887,IN ERROR.,"satisfactory. Mrs. Reiver took no special notice of him, beyond seeing"
19888,IN ERROR.,"that he was added to her list of admirers, and going for a walk with him"
19889,IN ERROR.,"now and then, just to show that he was her property, claimable as such."
19890,IN ERROR.,"Moriarty must have done most of the talking, for Mrs. Reiver couldn't"
19891,IN ERROR.,talk much to a man of his stamp; and the little she said could not have
19892,IN ERROR.,"been profitable. What Moriarty believed in, as he had good reason to,"
19893,IN ERROR.,"was Mrs. Reiver's influence over him, and, in that belief, set himself"
19894,IN ERROR.,seriously to try to do away with the vice that only he himself knew of.
19895,IN ERROR.,
19896,IN ERROR.,"His experiences while he was fighting with it must have been peculiar,"
19897,IN ERROR.,but he never described them. Sometimes he would hold off from everything
19898,IN ERROR.,"except water for a week. Then, on a rainy night, when no one had asked"
19899,IN ERROR.,"him out to dinner, and there was a big fire in his room, and everything"
19900,IN ERROR.,"comfortable, he would sit down and make a big night of it by adding"
19901,IN ERROR.,"little nip to little nip, planning big schemes of reformation meanwhile,"
19902,IN ERROR.,until he threw himself on his bed hopelessly drunk. He suffered next
19903,IN ERROR.,morning.
19904,IN ERROR.,
19905,IN ERROR.,"One night, the big crash came. He was troubled in his own mind over his"
19906,IN ERROR.,"attempts to make himself ""worthy of the friendship"" of Mrs. Reiver. The"
19907,IN ERROR.,"past ten days had been very bad ones, and the end of it all was that he"
19908,IN ERROR.,received the arrears of two and three-quarter years of sipping in one
19909,IN ERROR.,attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind; beginning with suicidal
19910,IN ERROR.,"depression, going on to fits and starts and hysteria, and ending with"
19911,IN ERROR.,"downright raving. As he sat in a chair in front of the fire, or walked"
19912,IN ERROR.,"up and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces, you heard what"
19913,IN ERROR.,"poor Moriarty really thought of Mrs. Reiver, for he raved about her"
19914,IN ERROR.,and his own fall for the most part; though he ravelled some P. W. D.
19915,IN ERROR.,"accounts into the same skein of thought. He talked, and talked, and"
19916,IN ERROR.,"talked in a low dry whisper to himself, and there was no stopping him."
19917,IN ERROR.,"He seemed to know that there was something wrong, and twice tried to"
19918,IN ERROR.,pull himself together and confer rationally with the Doctor; but his
19919,IN ERROR.,"mind ran out of control at once, and he fell back to a whisper and the"
19920,IN ERROR.,story of his troubles. It is terrible to hear a big man babbling like a
19921,IN ERROR.,"child of all that a man usually locks up, and puts away in the deep of"
19922,IN ERROR.,his heart. Moriarty read out his very soul for the benefit of any one
19923,IN ERROR.,who was in the room between ten-thirty that night and two-forty-five
19924,IN ERROR.,next morning.
19925,IN ERROR.,
19926,IN ERROR.,"From what he said, one gathered how immense an influence Mrs. Reiver"
19927,IN ERROR.,"held over him, and how thoroughly he felt for his own lapse. His"
19928,IN ERROR.,"whisperings cannot, of course, be put down here; but they were very"
19929,IN ERROR.,instructive as showing the errors of his estimates..........
19930,IN ERROR.,
19931,IN ERROR.,"When the trouble was over, and his few acquaintances were pitying him"
19932,IN ERROR.,"for the bad attack of jungle-fever that had so pulled him down, Moriarty"
19933,IN ERROR.,swore a big oath to himself and went abroad again with Mrs. Reiver till
19934,IN ERROR.,"the end of the season, adoring her in a quiet and deferential way as an"
19935,IN ERROR.,"angel from heaven. Later on he took to riding--not hacking, but honest"
19936,IN ERROR.,"riding--which was good proof that he was improving, and you could slam"
19937,IN ERROR.,"doors behind him without his jumping to his feet with a gasp. That,"
19938,IN ERROR.,"again, was hopeful."
19939,IN ERROR.,
19940,IN ERROR.,"How he kept his oath, and what it cost him in the beginning, nobody"
19941,IN ERROR.,knows. He certainly managed to compass the hardest thing that a man who
19942,IN ERROR.,"has drank heavily can do. He took his peg and wine at dinner, but he"
19943,IN ERROR.,"never drank alone, and never let what he drank have the least hold on"
19944,IN ERROR.,him.
19945,IN ERROR.,
19946,IN ERROR.,"Once he told a bosom-friend the story of his great trouble, and how the"
19947,IN ERROR.,"""influence of a pure honest woman, and an angel as well"" had saved him."
19948,IN ERROR.,When the man--startled at anything good being laid to Mrs. Reiver's
19949,IN ERROR.,"door--laughed, it cost him Moriarty's friendship."
19950,IN ERROR.,
19951,IN ERROR.,"Moriarty, who is married now to a woman ten thousand times better than"
19952,IN ERROR.,Mrs. Reiver--a woman who believes that there is no man on earth as
19953,IN ERROR.,good and clever as her husband--will go down to his grave vowing and
19954,IN ERROR.,protesting that Mrs. Reiver saved him from ruin in both worlds.
19955,IN ERROR.,
19956,IN ERROR.,That she knew anything of Moriarty's weakness nobody believed for
19957,IN ERROR.,"a moment. That she would have cut him dead, thrown him over, and"
19958,IN ERROR.,"acquainted all her friends with her discovery, if she had known of it,"
19959,IN ERROR.,nobody who knew her doubted for an instant.
19960,IN ERROR.,
19961,IN ERROR.,"oriarty thought her something she never was, and in that belief saved"
19962,IN ERROR.,himself. Which was just as good as though she had been everything that
19963,IN ERROR.,he had imagined.
19964,IN ERROR.,
19965,IN ERROR.,"But the question is, what claim will Mrs. Reiver have to the credit of"

20002,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20003,--THE MESS ROOM.,The Directors of the Bank--it had its headquarters in Calcutta and its

20006,--THE MESS ROOM.,They trusted him just as much as Directors ever trust Managers. You must
20007,--THE MESS ROOM.,see for yourself whether their trust was misplaced.
20008,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20009,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie's Branch was in a big Station, and worked with the usual"
20010,--THE MESS ROOM.,"staff--one Manager, one Accountant, both English, a Cashier, and a horde"
20011,--THE MESS ROOM.,of native clerks; besides the Police patrol at nights outside.
20012,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20013,--THE MESS ROOM.,"The bulk of its work, for it was in a thriving district, was hoondi and"
20014,--THE MESS ROOM.,accommodation of all kinds. A fool has no grip of this sort of business;
20015,--THE MESS ROOM.,"and a clever man who does not go about among his clients, and know more"

20017,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20018,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie was young-looking, clean-shaved, with a twinkle in his eye, and"
20019,--THE MESS ROOM.,a head that nothing short of a gallon of the Gunners' Madeira could make
20020,--THE MESS ROOM.,any impression on.
20021,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20022,--THE MESS ROOM.,"One day, at a big dinner, he announced casually that the Directors had"
20023,--THE MESS ROOM.,"shifted on to him a Natural Curiosity, from England, in the Accountant"
20024,--THE MESS ROOM.,"line. He was perfectly correct. Mr. Silas Riley, Accountant, was a MOST"
20025,--THE MESS ROOM.,"curious animal--a long, gawky, rawboned Yorkshireman, full of the savage"
20026,--THE MESS ROOM.,self-conceit that blossoms only in the best county in England. Arrogance
20027,--THE MESS ROOM.,was a mild word for the mental attitude of Mr. S. Riley. He had worked
20028,--THE MESS ROOM.,"himself up, after seven years, to a Cashier's position in a Huddersfield"

20030,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Perhaps he would have done better on the Bombay side, where they are"
20031,--THE MESS ROOM.,"happy with one-half per cent. profits, and money is cheap. He was"
20032,--THE MESS ROOM.,"useless for Upper India and a wheat Province, where a man wants a large"

20034,--THE MESS ROOM.,balance-sheet.
20035,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20036,--THE MESS ROOM.,"He was wonderfully narrow-minded in business, and, being new to the"

20038,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Home work. Like most clever self-made men, he had much simplicity in his"
20039,--THE MESS ROOM.,"nature; and, somehow or other, had construed the ordinarily polite terms"
20040,--THE MESS ROOM.,of his letter of engagement into a belief that the Directors had chosen
20041,--THE MESS ROOM.,"him on account of his special and brilliant talents, and that they set"
20042,--THE MESS ROOM.,great store by him. This notion grew and crystallized; thus adding to
20043,--THE MESS ROOM.,his natural North-country conceit.
20044,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20045,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Further, he was delicate, suffered from some trouble in his chest, and"

20048,--THE MESS ROOM.,You will admit that Reggie had reason to call his new Accountant a
20049,--THE MESS ROOM.,Natural Curiosity. The two men failed to hit it off at all. Riley
20050,--THE MESS ROOM.,"considered Reggie a wild, feather-headed idiot, given to Heaven only"
20051,--THE MESS ROOM.,"knew what dissipation in low places called ""Messes,"" and totally unfit"
20052,--THE MESS ROOM.,for the serious and solemn vocation of banking. He could never get
20053,--THE MESS ROOM.,"over Reggie's look of youth and ""you-be-damned"" air; and he couldn't"
20054,--THE MESS ROOM.,"understand Reggie's friends--clean-built, careless men in the Army--who"
20055,--THE MESS ROOM.,"rode over to big Sunday breakfasts at the Bank, and told sultry stories"
20056,--THE MESS ROOM.,till Riley got up and left the room. Riley was always showing Reggie
20057,--THE MESS ROOM.,"how the business ought to be conducted, and Reggie had more than once to"
20058,--THE MESS ROOM.,remind him that seven years' limited experience between Huddersfield and
20059,--THE MESS ROOM.,Beverly did not qualify a man to steer a big up-country business. Then
20060,--THE MESS ROOM.,Riley sulked and referred to himself as a pillar of the Bank and a
20061,--THE MESS ROOM.,"cherished friend of the Directors, and Reggie tore his hair. If a man's"
20062,--THE MESS ROOM.,"English subordinates fail him in this country, he comes to a hard time"
20063,--THE MESS ROOM.,"indeed, for native help has strict limitations. In the winter Riley went"
20064,--THE MESS ROOM.,"sick for weeks at a time with his lung complaint, and this threw more"
20065,--THE MESS ROOM.,work on Reggie. But he preferred it to the everlasting friction when
20066,--THE MESS ROOM.,Riley was well.
20067,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20068,--THE MESS ROOM.,One of the Travelling Inspectors of the Bank discovered these collapses
20069,--THE MESS ROOM.,and reported them to the Directors. Now Riley had been foisted on the
20070,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Bank by an M. P., who wanted the support of Riley's father, who, again,"
20071,--THE MESS ROOM.,was anxious to get his son out to a warmer climate because of those
20072,--THE MESS ROOM.,lungs. The M. P. had an interest in the Bank; but one of the Directors
20073,--THE MESS ROOM.,"wanted to advance a nominee of his own; and, after Riley's father had"
20074,--THE MESS ROOM.,"died, he made the rest of the Board see that an Accountant who was sick"
20075,--THE MESS ROOM.,"for half the year, had better give place to a healthy man. If Riley had"
20076,--THE MESS ROOM.,"known the real story of his appointment, he might have behaved better;"
20077,--THE MESS ROOM.,"but knowing nothing, his stretches of sickness alternated with restless,"
20078,--THE MESS ROOM.,"persistent, meddling irritation of Reggie, and all the hundred ways in"
20079,--THE MESS ROOM.,which conceit in a subordinate situation can find play. Reggie used to
20080,--THE MESS ROOM.,call him striking and hair-curling names behind his back as a relief to
20081,--THE MESS ROOM.,"his own feelings; but he never abused him to his face, because he said:"
20082,--THE MESS ROOM.,"""Riley is such a frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due"
20083,--THE MESS ROOM.,"to pains in the chest."""
20084,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20085,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Late one April, Riley went very sick indeed. The doctor punched him"
20086,--THE MESS ROOM.,"and thumped him, and told him he would be better before long. Then the"
20087,--THE MESS ROOM.,"doctor went to Reggie and said:--""Do you know how sick your Accountant"
20088,--THE MESS ROOM.,"is?"" ""No!"" said Reggie--""The worse the better, confound him! He's a"
20089,--THE MESS ROOM.,clacking nuisance when he's well. I'll let you take away the Bank Safe
20090,--THE MESS ROOM.,"if you can drug him silent for this hot-weather."""
20091,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20092,--THE MESS ROOM.,"But the doctor did not laugh--""Man, I'm not joking,"" he said. ""I'll give"
20093,--THE MESS ROOM.,him another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in.
20094,--THE MESS ROOM.,On my honor and reputation that's all the grace he has in this world.
20095,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Consumption has hold of him to the marrow."""
20096,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20097,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie's face changed at once into the face of ""Mr. Reginald Burke,"" and"
20098,--THE MESS ROOM.,"he answered:--""What can I do?"""
20099,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20100,--THE MESS ROOM.,"""Nothing,"" said the doctor. ""For all practical purposes the man is dead"
20101,--THE MESS ROOM.,already. Keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him he's going to recover.
20102,--THE MESS ROOM.,"That's all. I'll look after him to the end, of course."""
20103,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20104,--THE MESS ROOM.,"The doctor went away, and Reggie sat down to open the evening mail."
20105,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20106,--THE MESS ROOM.,"His first letter was one from the Directors, intimating for his"
20107,--THE MESS ROOM.,"information that Mr. Riley was to resign, under a month's notice, by the"
20108,--THE MESS ROOM.,"terms of his agreement, telling Reggie that their letter to Riley would"
20109,--THE MESS ROOM.,"follow and advising Reggie of the coming of a new Accountant, a man whom"
20110,--THE MESS ROOM.,Reggie knew and liked.
20111,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20112,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie lit a cheroot, and, before he had finished smoking, he had"
20113,--THE MESS ROOM.,"sketched the outline of a fraud. He put away--""burked""--the Directors"
20114,--THE MESS ROOM.,"letter, and went in to talk to Riley, who was as ungracious as usual,"
20115,--THE MESS ROOM.,and fretting himself over the way the bank would run during his illness.
20116,--THE MESS ROOM.,"He never thought of the extra work on Reggie's shoulders, but solely of"
20117,--THE MESS ROOM.,the damage to his own prospects of advancement. Then Reggie assured him
20118,--THE MESS ROOM.,"that everything would be well, and that he, Reggie, would confer with"
20119,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Riley daily on the management of the Bank. Riley was a little soothed,"
20120,--THE MESS ROOM.,but he hinted in as many words that he did not think much of Reggie's
20121,--THE MESS ROOM.,business capacity.
20122,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20123,--THE MESS ROOM.,Reggie was humble. And he had letters in his desk from the Directors
20124,--THE MESS ROOM.,that a Gilbarte or a Hardie might have been proud of!
20125,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20126,--THE MESS ROOM.,"The days passed in the big darkened house, and the Directors' letter of"
20127,--THE MESS ROOM.,"dismissal to Riley came and was put away by Reggie, who, every evening,"
20128,--THE MESS ROOM.,"brought the books to Riley's room, and showed him what had been going"
20129,--THE MESS ROOM.,"forward, while Riley snarled. Reggie did his best to make statements"
20130,--THE MESS ROOM.,"pleasing to Riley, but the Accountant was sure that the Bank was going"
20131,--THE MESS ROOM.,"to rack and ruin without him. In June, as the lying in bed told on his"
20132,--THE MESS ROOM.,"spirit, he asked whether his absence had been noted by the Directors,"
20133,--THE MESS ROOM.,"and Reggie said that they had written most sympathetic letters, hoping"
20134,--THE MESS ROOM.,that he would be able to resume his valuable services before long. He
20135,--THE MESS ROOM.,showed Riley the letters: and Riley said that the Directors ought to
20136,--THE MESS ROOM.,have written to him direct.
20137,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20138,--THE MESS ROOM.,"A few days later, Reggie opened Riley's mail in the half-light of the"
20139,--THE MESS ROOM.,"room, and gave him the sheet--not the envelope--of a letter to Riley"
20140,--THE MESS ROOM.,from the Directors. Riley said he would thank Reggie not to interfere
20141,--THE MESS ROOM.,"with his private papers, specially as Reggie knew he was too weak to"
20142,--THE MESS ROOM.,open his own letters. Reggie apologized.
20143,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20144,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Then Riley's mood changed, and he lectured Reggie on his evil ways:"
20145,--THE MESS ROOM.,"his horses and his bad friends. ""Of course, lying here on my back, Mr."
20146,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Burke, I can't keep you straight; but when I'm well, I DO hope you'll"
20147,--THE MESS ROOM.,"pay some heed to my words."" Reggie, who had dropped polo, and dinners,"
20148,--THE MESS ROOM.,"and tennis, and all to attend to Riley, said that he was penitent and"
20149,--THE MESS ROOM.,settled Riley's head on the pillow and heard him fret and contradict in
20150,--THE MESS ROOM.,"hard, dry, hacking whispers, without a sign of impatience. This at the"
20151,--THE MESS ROOM.,"end of a heavy day's office work, doing double duty, in the latter half"
20152,--THE MESS ROOM.,of June.
20153,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20154,--THE MESS ROOM.,"When the new Accountant came, Reggie told him the facts of the case, and"
20155,--THE MESS ROOM.,announced to Riley that he had a guest staying with him. Riley said that
20156,--THE MESS ROOM.,"he might have had more consideration than to entertain his ""doubtful"
20157,--THE MESS ROOM.,"friends"" at such a time. Reggie made Carron, the new Accountant, sleep"
20158,--THE MESS ROOM.,at the Club in consequence. Carron's arrival took some of the heavy work
20159,--THE MESS ROOM.,"off his shoulders, and he had time to attend to Riley's exactions--to"
20160,--THE MESS ROOM.,"explain, soothe, invent, and settle and resettle the poor wretch in"
20161,--THE MESS ROOM.,"bed, and to forge complimentary letters from Calcutta. At the end of the"
20162,--THE MESS ROOM.,"first month, Riley wished to send some money home to his mother. Reggie"
20163,--THE MESS ROOM.,"sent the draft. At the end of the second month, Riley's salary came in"
20164,--THE MESS ROOM.,"just the same. Reggie paid it out of his own pocket; and, with it, wrote"
20165,--THE MESS ROOM.,Riley a beautiful letter from the Directors.
20166,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20167,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Riley was very ill indeed, but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily."
20168,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Now and then he would be cheerful and confident about the future,"
20169,--THE MESS ROOM.,sketching plans for going Home and seeing his mother.
20170,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20171,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie listened patiently when the office work was over, and encouraged"
20172,--THE MESS ROOM.,him.
20173,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20174,--THE MESS ROOM.,At other times Riley insisted on Reggie's reading the Bible and grim
20175,--THE MESS ROOM.,"""Methody"" tracts to him. Out of these tracts he pointed morals directed"
20176,--THE MESS ROOM.,at his Manager. But he always found time to worry Reggie about the
20177,--THE MESS ROOM.,"working of the Bank, and to show him where the weak points lay."
20178,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20179,--THE MESS ROOM.,"This in-door, sick-room life and constant strains wore Reggie down a"
20180,--THE MESS ROOM.,"good deal, and shook his nerves, and lowered his billiard-play by forty"
20181,--THE MESS ROOM.,"points. But the business of the Bank, and the business of the sick-room,"
20182,--THE MESS ROOM.,"had to go on, though the glass was 116 degrees in the shade."
20183,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20184,--THE MESS ROOM.,"At the end of the third month, Riley was sinking fast, and had begun"
20185,--THE MESS ROOM.,to realize that he was very sick. But the conceit that made him worry
20186,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie, kept him from believing the worst. ""He wants some sort of mental"
20187,--THE MESS ROOM.,"stimulant if he is to drag on,"" said the doctor."
20188,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20189,--THE MESS ROOM.,"""Keep him interested in life if you care about his living."" So Riley,"
20190,--THE MESS ROOM.,"contrary to all the laws of business and the finance, received a"
20191,--THE MESS ROOM.,"25-per-cent, rise of salary from the Directors. The ""mental stimulant"""
20192,--THE MESS ROOM.,"succeeded beautifully. Riley was happy and cheerful, and, as is often"
20193,--THE MESS ROOM.,"the case in consumption, healthiest in mind when the body was weakest."
20194,--THE MESS ROOM.,"He lingered for a full month, snarling and fretting about the Bank,"
20195,--THE MESS ROOM.,"talking of the future, hearing the Bible read, lecturing Reggie on sin,"
20196,--THE MESS ROOM.,and wondering when he would be able to move abroad.
20197,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20198,--THE MESS ROOM.,"But at the end of September, one mercilessly hot evening, he rose up in"
20199,--THE MESS ROOM.,"his bed with a little gasp, and said quickly to Reggie:--""Mr. Burke, I"
20200,--THE MESS ROOM.,"am going to die. I know it in myself. My chest is all hollow inside, and"
20201,--THE MESS ROOM.,there's nothing to breathe with. To the best of my knowledge I have done
20202,--THE MESS ROOM.,"nowt""--he was returning to the talk of his boyhood--""to lie heavy on my"
20203,--THE MESS ROOM.,"conscience. God be thanked, I have been preserved from the grosser forms"
20204,--THE MESS ROOM.,"of sin; and I counsel YOU, Mr. Burke...."""
20205,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20206,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Here his voice died down, and Reggie stooped over him."
20207,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20208,--THE MESS ROOM.,"""Send my salary for September to my mother.... done great things with"
20209,--THE MESS ROOM.,the Bank if I had been spared.... mistaken policy.... no fault
20210,--THE MESS ROOM.,"of mine."""
20211,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20212,--THE MESS ROOM.,Then he turned his face to the wall and died.
20213,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20214,--THE MESS ROOM.,"Reggie drew the sheet over Its face, and went out into the verandah,"
20215,--THE MESS ROOM.,"with his last ""mental stimulant""--a letter of condolence and sympathy"
20216,--THE MESS ROOM.,from the Directors--unused in his pocket.
20217,--THE MESS ROOM.,
20218,--THE MESS ROOM.,"""If I'd been only ten minutes earlier,"" thought Reggie, ""I might have"
20219,--THE MESS ROOM.,"heartened him up to pull through another day."""

20235,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Now Tods' Mamma was a singularly charming woman, and every one in Simla"
20236,TODS' AMENDMENT.,knew Tods. Most men had saved him from death on occasions.
20237,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20238,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He was beyond his ayah's control altogether, and perilled his life daily"
20239,TODS' AMENDMENT.,to find out what would happen if you pulled a Mountain Battery mule's
20240,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"tail. He was an utterly fearless young Pagan, about six years old, and"
20241,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the only baby who ever broke the holy calm of the supreme Legislative
20242,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Council.
20243,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20244,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"It happened this way: Tods' pet kid got loose, and fled up the hill, off"
20245,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the Boileaugunge Road, Tods after it, until it burst into the Viceregal"
20246,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Lodge lawn, then attached to ""Peterhoff."" The Council were sitting at"
20247,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the time, and the windows were open because it was warm. The Red Lancer"
20248,TODS' AMENDMENT.,in the porch told Tods to go away; but Tods knew the Red Lancer and most
20249,TODS' AMENDMENT.,of the Members of Council personally.
20250,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20251,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Moreover, he had firm hold of the kid's collar, and was being dragged"
20252,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"all across the flower-beds. ""Give my salaam to the long Councillor"
20253,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Sahib, and ask him to help me take Moti back!"" gasped Tods. The Council"
20254,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"heard the noise through the open windows; and, after an interval, was"
20255,TODS' AMENDMENT.,seen the shocking spectacle of a Legal Member and a Lieutenant-Governor
20256,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"helping, under the direct patronage of a Commander-in-Chief and a"
20257,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Viceroy, one small and very dirty boy in a sailor's suit and a tangle"
20258,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of brown hair, to coerce a lively and rebellious kid. They headed it off"
20259,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"down the path to the Mall, and Tods went home in triumph and told his"
20260,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Mamma that ALL the Councillor Sahibs had been helping him to catch Moti.
20261,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Whereat his Mamma smacked Tods for interfering with the administration
20262,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of the Empire; but Tods met the Legal Member the next day, and told him"
20263,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"in confidence that if the Legal Member ever wanted to catch a goat, he,"
20264,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods, would give him all the help in his power. ""Thank you, Tods,"" said"
20265,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the Legal Member.
20266,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20267,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods was the idol of some eighty jhampanis, and half as many saises."
20268,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20269,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He saluted them all as ""O Brother."" It never entered his head that"
20270,TODS' AMENDMENT.,any living human being could disobey his orders; and he was the
20271,TODS' AMENDMENT.,buffer between the servants and his Mamma's wrath. The working of that
20272,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"household turned on Tods, who was adored by every one from the dhoby"
20273,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"to the dog-boy. Even Futteh Khan, the villainous loafer khit from"
20274,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Mussoorie, shirked risking Tods' displeasure for fear his co-mates"
20275,TODS' AMENDMENT.,should look down on him.
20276,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20277,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"So Tods had honor in the land from Boileaugunge to Chota Simla, and"
20278,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"ruled justly according to his lights. Of course, he spoke Urdu, but he"
20279,TODS' AMENDMENT.,had also mastered many queer side-speeches like the chotee bolee of the
20280,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"women, and held grave converse with shopkeepers and Hill-coolies alike."
20281,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He was precocious for his age, and his mixing with natives had taught"
20282,TODS' AMENDMENT.,him some of the more bitter truths of life; the meanness and the
20283,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"sordidness of it. He used, over his bread and milk, to deliver solemn"
20284,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"and serious aphorisms, translated from the vernacular into the English,"
20285,TODS' AMENDMENT.,that made his Mamma jump and vow that Tods MUST go home next hot
20286,TODS' AMENDMENT.,weather.
20287,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20288,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Just when Tods was in the bloom of his power, the Supreme Legislature"
20289,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"were hacking out a Bill, for the Sub-Montane Tracts, a revision of the"
20290,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"then Act, smaller than the Punjab Land Bill, but affecting a few"
20291,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"hundred thousand people none the less. The Legal Member had built,"
20292,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"and bolstered, and embroidered, and amended that Bill, till it looked"
20293,TODS' AMENDMENT.,beautiful on paper. Then the Council began to settle what they called
20294,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the ""minor details."" As if any Englishman legislating for natives knows"
20295,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"enough to know which are the minor and which are the major points, from"
20296,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the native point of view, of any measure! That Bill was a triumph of"
20297,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""safe-guarding the interests of the tenant."" One clause provided that"
20298,TODS' AMENDMENT.,land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch;
20299,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"because, if the landlord had a tenant bound down for, say, twenty years,"
20300,TODS' AMENDMENT.,he would squeeze the very life out of him. The notion was to keep up
20301,TODS' AMENDMENT.,a stream of independent cultivators in the Sub-Montane Tracts; and
20302,TODS' AMENDMENT.,ethnologically and politically the notion was correct. The only drawback
20303,TODS' AMENDMENT.,was that it was altogether wrong. A native's life in India implies the
20304,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"life of his son. Wherefore, you cannot legislate for one generation at"
20305,TODS' AMENDMENT.,a time. You must consider the next from the native point of view.
20306,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Curiously enough, the native now and then, and in Northern India more"
20307,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"particularly, hates being over-protected against himself. There was"
20308,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"a Naga village once, where they lived on dead AND buried Commissariat"
20309,TODS' AMENDMENT.,mules.... But that is another story.
20310,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20311,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"For many reasons, to be explained later, the people concerned objected"
20312,TODS' AMENDMENT.,to the Bill. The Native Member in Council knew as much about Punjabis as
20313,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"he knew about Charing Cross. He had said in Calcutta that ""the Bill was"
20314,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class,"
20315,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the cultivators;"" and so on, and so on. The Legal Member's knowledge"
20316,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of natives was limited to English-speaking Durbaris, and his own red"
20317,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"chaprassis, the Sub-Montane Tracts concerned no one in particular,"
20318,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the Deputy Commissioners were a good deal too driven to make
20319,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"representations, and the measure was one which dealt with small"
20320,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"landholders only. Nevertheless, the Legal Member prayed that it might be"
20321,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"correct, for he was a nervously conscientious man. He did not know that"
20322,TODS' AMENDMENT.,no man can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the
20323,TODS' AMENDMENT.,varnish off. And not always then. But he did the best he knew. And the
20324,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"measure came up to the Supreme Council for the final touches, while Tods"
20325,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"patrolled the Burra Simla Bazar in his morning rides, and played with"
20326,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the monkey belonging to Ditta Mull, the bunnia, and listened, as a child"
20327,TODS' AMENDMENT.,listens to all the stray talk about this new freak of the Lat Sahib's.
20328,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20329,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"One day there was a dinner-party, at the house of Tods' Mamma, and the"
20330,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Legal Member came. Tods was in bed, but he kept awake till he heard the"
20331,TODS' AMENDMENT.,bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee. Then he paddled out in
20332,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"his little red flannel dressing-gown and his night-suit, and took refuge"
20333,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"by the side of his father, knowing that he would not be sent back. ""See"
20334,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the miseries of having a family!"" said Tods' father, giving Tods three"
20335,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"prunes, some water in a glass that had been used for claret, and telling"
20336,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"him to sit still. Tods sucked the prunes slowly, knowing that he would"
20337,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"have to go when they were finished, and sipped the pink water like a man"
20338,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of the world, as he listened to the conversation. Presently, the Legal"
20339,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Member, talking ""shop,"" to the Head of a Department, mentioned his Bill"
20340,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"by its full name--""The Sub-Montane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment."""
20341,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods caught the one native word, and lifting up his small voice"
20342,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"said:--""Oh, I know ALL about that! Has it been murramutted yet,"
20343,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Councillor Sahib?"""
20344,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20345,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""How much?"" said the Legal Member."
20346,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20347,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""Murramutted--mended.--Put theek, you know--made nice to please Ditta"
20348,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Mull!"""
20349,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20350,TODS' AMENDMENT.,The Legal Member left his place and moved up next to Tods.
20351,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20352,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""What do you know about Ryotwari, little man?"" he said."
20353,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20354,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""I'm not a little man, I'm Tods, and I know ALL about it. Ditta Mull,"
20355,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"and Choga Lall, and Amir Nath, and--oh, lakhs of my friends tell me"
20356,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"about it in the bazars when I talk to them."""
20357,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20358,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""Oh, they do--do they? What do they say, Tods?"""
20359,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20360,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressing-gown and said:--""I"
20361,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"must fink."""
20362,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20363,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"The Legal Member waited patiently. Then Tods, with infinite compassion:"
20364,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20365,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""You don't speak my talk, do you, Councillor Sahib?"""
20366,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20367,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""No; I am sorry to say I do not,"" said the Legal' Member."
20368,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20369,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""Very well,"" said Tods. ""I must fink in English."""
20370,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20371,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He spent a minute putting his ideas in order, and began very slowly,"
20372,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"translating in his mind from the vernacular to English, as many"
20373,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Anglo-Indian children do. You must remember that the Legal Member
20374,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"helped him on by questions when he halted, for Tods was not equal to the"
20375,TODS' AMENDMENT.,sustained flight of oratory that follows.
20376,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20377,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""Ditta Mull says:--'This thing is the talk of a child, and was made up"
20378,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"by fools.' But I don't think you are a fool, Councillor Sahib,"" said"
20379,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods, hastily. ""You caught my goat. This is what Ditta Mull says:--'I am"
20380,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"not a fool, and why should the Sirkar say I am a child? I can see if"
20381,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the land is good and if the landlord is good. If I am a fool, the sin is"
20382,TODS' AMENDMENT.,upon my own head. For five years I take my ground for which I have saved
20383,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"money, and a wife I take too, and a little son is born.' Ditta Mull has"
20384,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"one daughter now, but he SAYS he will have a son, soon. And he says: 'At"
20385,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the end of five years, by this new bundobust, I must go. If I do not go,"
20386,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"I must get fresh seals and takkus-stamps on the papers, perhaps in the"
20387,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"middle of the harvest, and to go to the law-courts once is wisdom, but"
20388,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"to go twice is Jehannum.' That is QUITE true,"" explained Tods, gravely."
20389,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""All my friends say so. And Ditta Mull says:--'Always fresh takkus and"
20390,TODS' AMENDMENT.,paying money to vakils and chaprassis and law-courts every five years or
20391,TODS' AMENDMENT.,else the landlord makes me go. Why do I want to go? Am I fool? If I am a
20392,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"fool and do not know, after forty years, good land when I see it, let"
20393,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"me die! But if the new bundobust says for FIFTEEN years, then it is"
20394,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"good and wise. My little son is a man, and I am burnt, and he takes the"
20395,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"ground or another ground, paying only once for the takkus-stamps on the"
20396,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"papers, and his little son is born, and at the end of fifteen years is"
20397,TODS' AMENDMENT.,a man too. But what profit is there in five years and fresh papers?
20398,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Nothing but dikh, trouble, dikh. We are not young men who take these"
20399,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"lands, but old ones--not jais, but tradesmen with a little money--and"
20400,TODS' AMENDMENT.,for fifteen years we shall have peace. Nor are we children that the
20401,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Sirkar should treat us so."""
20402,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20403,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Here Tods stopped short, for the whole table were listening. The Legal"
20404,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Member said to Tods: ""Is that all?"""
20405,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20406,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""All I can remember,"" said Tods. ""But you should see Ditta Mull's big"
20407,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"monkey. It's just like a Councillor Sahib."""
20408,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20409,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"""Tods! Go to bed,"" said his father."
20410,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20411,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Tods gathered up his dressing-gown tail and departed.
20412,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20413,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"The Legal Member brought his hand down on the table with a crash--""By"
20414,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Jove!"" said the Legal Member, ""I believe the boy is right. The short"
20415,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"tenure IS the weak point."""
20416,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20417,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He left early, thinking over what Tods had said. Now, it was obviously"
20418,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"impossible for the Legal Member to play with a bunnia's monkey, by way"
20419,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of getting understanding; but he did better. He made inquiries,"
20420,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"always bearing in mind the fact that the real native--not the hybrid,"
20421,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"University-trained mule--is as timid as a colt, and, little by little,"
20422,TODS' AMENDMENT.,he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most intimately to
20423,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"give in their views, which squared very closely with Tods' evidence."
20424,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20425,TODS' AMENDMENT.,So the Bill was amended in that clause; and the Legal Member was filled
20426,TODS' AMENDMENT.,with an uneasy suspicion that Native Members represent very little
20427,TODS' AMENDMENT.,except the Orders they carry on their bosoms. But he put the thought
20428,TODS' AMENDMENT.,from him as illiberal. He was a most Liberal Man.
20429,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20430,TODS' AMENDMENT.,After a time the news spread through the bazars that Tods had got the
20431,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Bill recast in the tenure clause, and if Tods' Mamma had not interfered,"
20432,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio
20433,TODS' AMENDMENT.,nuts and Cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah. Till he
20434,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"went Home, Tods ranked some few degrees before the Viceroy in popular"
20435,TODS' AMENDMENT.,estimation. But for the little life of him Tods could not understand
20436,TODS' AMENDMENT.,why.
20437,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
20438,TODS' AMENDMENT.,In the Legal Member's private-paper-box still lies the rough draft of
20439,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the Sub-Montane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment; and, opposite the"
20440,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"twenty-second clause, pencilled in blue chalk, and signed by the Legal"
20441,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Member, are the words ""Tods' Amendment."""

20454,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,--Life's Handicap.
20455,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20456,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,When I was telling you of the joke that The Worm played off on the
20457,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Senior Subaltern, I promised a somewhat similar tale, but with all the"
20458,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,jest left out. This is that tale:
20459,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20460,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Dicky Hatt was kidnapped in his early, early youth--neither by"
20461,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"landlady's daughter, housemaid, barmaid, nor cook, but by a girl so"
20462,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,nearly of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just
20463,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,the least little bit in the world below it. This happened a month
20464,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"before he came out to India, and five days after his one-and-twentieth"
20465,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,birthday. The girl was nineteen--six years older than Dicky in the
20466,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"things of this world, that is to say--and, for the time, twice as"
20467,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,foolish as he.
20468,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20469,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Excepting, always, falling off a horse there is nothing more fatally"
20470,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,easy than marriage before the Registrar. The ceremony costs less than
20471,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"fifty shillings, and is remarkably like walking into a pawn-shop. After"
20472,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"the declarations of residence have been put in, four minutes will"
20473,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"cover the rest of the proceedings--fees, attestation, and all. Then the"
20474,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Registrar slides the blotting-pad over the names, and says grimly, with"
20475,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"his pen between his teeth:--""Now you're man and wife;"" and the couple"
20476,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"walk out into the street, feeling as if something were horribly illegal"
20477,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,somewhere.
20478,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20479,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,But that ceremony holds and can drag a man to his undoing just
20480,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"as thoroughly as the ""long as ye both shall live"" curse from the"
20481,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"altar-rails, with the bridesmaids giggling behind, and ""The Voice that"
20482,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"breathed o'er Eden"" lifting the roof off. In this manner was Dicky Hatt"
20483,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"kidnapped, and he considered it vastly fine, for he had received an"
20484,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,appointment in India which carried a magnificent salary from the Home
20485,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,point of view. The marriage was to be kept secret for a year. Then Mrs.
20486,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,Dicky Hatt was to come out and the rest of life was to be a glorious
20487,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,golden mist. That was how they sketched it under the Addison Road
20488,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Station lamps; and, after one short month, came Gravesend and Dicky"
20489,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"steaming out to his new life, and the girl crying in a thirty-shillings"
20490,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"a week bed-and-living room, in a back street off Montpelier Square near"
20491,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,the Knightsbridge Barracks.
20492,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20493,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"But the country that Dicky came to was a hard land, where ""men"" of"
20494,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"twenty-one were reckoned very small boys indeed, and life was expensive."
20495,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,The salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far.
20496,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Particularly when Dicky divided it by two, and remitted more than the"
20497,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"fair half, at 1-6, to Montpelier Square. One hundred and thirty-five"
20498,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,rupees out of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on; but
20499,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,it was absurd to suppose that Mrs. Hatt could exist forever on the 20
20500,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"pounds held back by Dicky, from his outfit allowance. Dicky saw this,"
20501,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"and remitted at once; always remembering that Rs. 700 were to be paid,"
20502,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"twelve months later, for a first-class passage out for a lady. When you"
20503,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,add to these trifling details the natural instincts of a boy beginning a
20504,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"new life in a new country and longing to go about and enjoy himself, and"
20505,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"the necessity for grappling with strange work--which, properly speaking,"
20506,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,should take up a boy's undivided attention--you will see that Dicky
20507,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,started handicapped. He saw it himself for a breath or two; but he did
20508,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,not guess the full beauty of his future.
20509,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20510,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"As the hot weather began, the shackles settled on him and ate into his"
20511,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"flesh. First would come letters--big, crossed, seven sheet letters--from"
20512,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"his wife, telling him how she longed to see him, and what a Heaven upon"
20513,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,earth would be their property when they met.
20514,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20515,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,Then some boy of the chummery wherein Dicky lodged would pound on the
20516,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"door of his bare little room, and tell him to come out and look at a"
20517,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,pony--the very thing to suit him. Dicky could not afford ponies. He had
20518,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"to explain this. Dicky could not afford living in the chummery, modest"
20519,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,as it was. He had to explain this before he moved to a single room next
20520,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,the office where he worked all day. He kept house on a green oil-cloth
20521,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"table-cover, one chair, one charpoy, one photograph, one tooth-glass,"
20522,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"very strong and thick, a seven-rupee eight-anna filter, and messing by"
20523,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,contract at thirty-seven rupees a month. Which last item was extortion.
20524,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"He had no punkah, for a punkah costs fifteen rupees a month; but he"
20525,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,slept on the roof of the office with all his wife's letters under his
20526,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,pillow. Now and again he was asked out to dinner where he got both a
20527,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"punkah and an iced drink. But this was seldom, for people objected"
20528,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,to recognizing a boy who had evidently the instincts of a Scotch
20529,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"tallow-chandler, and who lived in such a nasty fashion. Dicky could not"
20530,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"subscribe to any amusement, so he found no amusement except the pleasure"
20531,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"of turning over his Bank-book and reading what it said about ""loans"
20532,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"on approved security."" That cost nothing. He remitted through a Bombay"
20533,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Bank, by the way, and the Station knew nothing of his private affairs."
20534,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20535,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,Every month he sent Home all he could possibly spare for his wife--and
20536,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,for another reason which was expected to explain itself shortly and
20537,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,would require more money.
20538,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20539,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"About this time, Dicky was overtaken with the nervous, haunting fear"
20540,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,that besets married men when they are out of sorts. He had no pension to
20541,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"look to. What if he should die suddenly, and leave his wife unprovided"
20542,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"for? The thought used to lay hold of him in the still, hot nights on the"
20543,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"roof, till the shaking of his heart made him think that he was going to"
20544,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,die then and there of heart-disease.
20545,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20546,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,Now this is a frame of mind which no boy has a right to know. It is
20547,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"a strong man's trouble; but, coming when it did, it nearly drove poor"
20548,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"punkah-less, perspiring Dicky Hatt mad. He could tell no one about it."
20549,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20550,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"A certain amount of ""screw"" is as necessary for a man as for a"
20551,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,billiard-ball. It makes them both do wonderful things. Dicky needed
20552,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"money badly, and he worked for it like a horse. But, naturally, the men"
20553,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,who owned him knew that a boy can live very comfortably on a certain
20554,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"income--pay in India is a matter of age, not merit, you see, and if"
20555,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"their particular boy wished to work like two boys, Business forbid that"
20556,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,they should stop him! But Business forbid that they should give him an
20557,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,increase of pay at his present ridiculously immature age! So Dicky won
20558,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,certain rises of salary--ample for a boy--not enough for a wife and
20559,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,child--certainly too little for the seven-hundred-rupee passage that he
20560,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,and Mrs. Hatt had discussed so lightly once upon a time. And with this
20561,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,he was forced to be content.
20562,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20563,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Somehow, all his money seemed to fade away in Home drafts and the"
20564,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"crushing Exchange, and the tone of the Home letters changed and grew"
20565,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"querulous. ""Why wouldn't Dicky have his wife and the baby out? Surely he"
20566,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,had a salary--a fine salary--and it was too bad of him to enjoy himself
20567,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,in India. But would he--could he--make the next draft a little more
20568,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"elastic?"" Here followed a list of baby's kit, as long as a Parsee's"
20569,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"bill. Then Dicky, whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son"
20570,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"he had never seen--which, again, is a feeling no boy is entitled"
20571,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"to--enlarged the draft and wrote queer half-boy, half-man letters,"
20572,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,saying that life was not so enjoyable after all and would the little
20573,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"wife wait yet a little longer? But the little wife, however much she"
20574,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"approved of money, objected to waiting, and there was a strange, hard"
20575,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"sort of ring in her letters that Dicky didn't understand. How could he,"
20576,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,poor boy?
20577,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20578,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,Later on still--just as Dicky had been told--apropos of another
20579,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"youngster who had ""made a fool of himself,"" as the saying is--that"
20580,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement, but"
20581,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"would lose him his present appointment--came the news that the baby, his"
20582,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"own little, little son, had died, and, behind this, forty lines of"
20583,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"an angry woman's scrawl, saying that death might have been averted if"
20584,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"certain things, all costing money, had been done, or if the mother and"
20585,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,the baby had been with Dicky. The letter struck at Dicky's naked heart;
20586,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"but, not being officially entitled to a baby, he could show no sign of"
20587,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,trouble.
20588,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20589,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"How Dicky won through the next four months, and what hope he kept"
20590,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"alight to force him into his work, no one dare say. He pounded on, the"
20591,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"seven-hundred-rupee passage as far away as ever, and his style of living"
20592,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"unchanged, except when he launched into a new filter."
20593,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20594,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"There was the strain of his office-work, and the strain of his"
20595,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"remittances, and the knowledge of his boy's death, which touched the boy"
20596,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"more, perhaps, than it would have touched a man; and, beyond all, the"
20597,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"enduring strain of his daily life. Gray-headed seniors, who approved"
20598,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"of his thrift and his fashion of denying himself everything pleasant,"
20599,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,reminded him of the old saw that says:
20600,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20601,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"""If a youth would be distinguished in his art, art, art,"
20602,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"He must keep the girls away from his heart, heart, heart."""
20603,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20604,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"And Dicky, who fancied he had been through every trouble that a man is"
20605,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"permitted to know, had to laugh and agree; with the last line of his"
20606,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,balanced Bank-book jingling in his head day and night.
20607,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20608,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,But he had one more sorrow to digest before the end. There arrived a
20609,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,letter from the little wife--the natural sequence of the others if
20610,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Dicky had only known it--and the burden of that letter was ""gone with"
20611,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"a handsomer man than you."" It was a rather curious production, without"
20612,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"stops, something like this:--""She was not going to wait forever and the"
20613,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,baby was dead and Dicky was only a boy and he would never set eyes on
20614,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,her again and why hadn't he waved his handkerchief to her when he left
20615,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,Gravesend and God was her judge she was a wicked woman but Dicky was
20616,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,worse enjoying himself in India and this other man loved the ground she
20617,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,trod on and would Dicky ever forgive her for she would never forgive
20618,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Dicky; and there was no address to write to."""
20619,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20620,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Instead of thanking his lucky stars that he was free, Dicky discovered"
20621,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"exactly how an injured husband feels--again, not at all the knowledge"
20622,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,to which a boy is entitled--for his mind went back to his wife as he
20623,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"remembered her in the thirty-shilling ""suite"" in Montpelier Square, when"
20624,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"the dawn of his last morning in England was breaking, and she was crying"
20625,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,in the bed. Whereat he rolled about on his bed and bit his fingers. He
20626,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"never stopped to think whether, if he had met Mrs. Hatt after those"
20627,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"two years, he would have discovered that he and she had grown quite"
20628,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"different and new persons. This, theoretically, he ought to have done."
20629,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,He spent the night after the English Mail came in rather severe pain.
20630,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20631,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"Next morning, Dicky Hatt felt disinclined to work. He argued that he had"
20632,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"missed the pleasure of youth. He was tired, and he had tasted all the"
20633,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,sorrow in life before three-and-twenty. His Honor was gone--that was the
20634,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"man; and now he, too, would go to the Devil--that was the boy in him. So"
20635,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"he put his head down on the green oil-cloth table-cover, and wept before"
20636,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"resigning his post, and all it offered."
20637,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20638,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,But the reward of his services came. He was given three days to
20639,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"reconsider himself, and the Head of the establishment, after some"
20640,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"telegraphings, said that it was a most unusual step, but, in view of the"
20641,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"ability that Mr. Hatt had displayed at such and such a time, at such and"
20642,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"such junctures, he was in a position to offer him an infinitely superior"
20643,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"post--first on probation, and later, in the natural course of things,"
20644,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"on confirmation. ""And how much does the post carry?"" said Dicky. ""Six"
20645,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"hundred and fifty rupees,"" said the Head slowly, expecting to see the"
20646,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,young man sink with gratitude and joy.
20647,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20648,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"And it came then! The seven hundred rupee passage, and enough to have"
20649,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"saved the wife, and the little son, and to have allowed of assured and"
20650,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"open marriage, came then. Dicky burst into a roar of laughter--laughter"
20651,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"he could not check--nasty, jangling merriment that seemed as if it"
20652,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"would go on forever. When he had recovered himself he said, quite"
20653,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"seriously:--""I'm tired of work. I'm an old man now. It's about time I"
20654,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"retired. And I will."""
20655,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20656,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,"""The boy's mad!"" said the Head."
20657,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20658,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,I think he was right; but Dicky Hatt never reappeared to settle the
20659,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,question.
20660,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20661,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20662,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20663,IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH.,
20664,PIG.,PIG.
20665,PIG.,
20666,PIG.,"Go, stalk the red deer o'er the heather"
20667,PIG.,"Ride, follow the fox if you can!"
20668,PIG.,"But, for pleasure and profit together,"

20673,PIG.,
20674,PIG.,"I believe the difference began in the matter of a horse, with a twist in"
20675,PIG.,"his temper, whom Pinecoffin sold to Nafferton and by whom Nafferton was"
20676,PIG.,nearly slain. There may have been other causes of offence; the horse was
20677,PIG.,the official stalking-horse. Nafferton was very angry; but Pinecoffin
20678,PIG.,laughed and said that he had never guaranteed the beast's manners.
20679,PIG.,"Nafferton laughed, too, though he vowed that he would write off his fall"
20680,PIG.,"against Pinecoffin if he waited five years. Now, a Dalesman from beyond"
20681,PIG.,Skipton will forgive an injury when the Strid lets a man live; but a
20682,PIG.,South Devon man is as soft as a Dartmoor bog. You can see from their
20683,PIG.,names that Nafferton had the race-advantage of Pinecoffin. He was a
20684,PIG.,"peculiar man, and his notions of humor were cruel. He taught me a new"
20685,PIG.,and fascinating form of shikar. He hounded Pinecoffin from Mithankot
20686,PIG.,"to Jagadri, and from Gurgaon to Abbottabad up and across the Punjab,"
20687,PIG.,a large province and in places remarkably dry. He said that he had no
20688,PIG.,"intention of allowing Assistant Commissioners to ""sell him pups,"" in the"
20689,PIG.,"shape of ramping, screaming countrybreds, without making their lives a"
20690,PIG.,burden to them.
20691,PIG.,
20692,PIG.,Most Assistant Commissioners develop a bent for some special work after
20693,PIG.,their first hot weather in the country. The boys with digestions hope to
20694,PIG.,write their names large on the Frontier and struggle for dreary places
20695,PIG.,like Bannu and Kohat. The bilious ones climb into the Secretariat. Which
20696,PIG.,is very bad for the liver.
20697,PIG.,
20698,PIG.,"Others are bitten with a mania for District work, Ghuznivide coins or"
20699,PIG.,"Persian poetry; while some, who come of farmers' stock, find that the"
20700,PIG.,"smell of the Earth after the Rains gets into their blood, and calls them"
20701,PIG.,"to ""develop the resources of the Province."" These men are enthusiasts."
20702,PIG.,Pinecoffin belonged to their class. He knew a great many facts bearing
20703,PIG.,"on the cost of bullocks and temporary wells, and opium-scrapers, and"
20704,PIG.,"what happens if you burn too much rubbish on a field, in the hope of"
20705,PIG.,enriching used-up soil. All the Pinecoffins come of a landholding
20706,PIG.,"breed, and so the land only took back her own again. Unfortunately--most"
20707,PIG.,"unfortunately for Pinecoffin--he was a Civilian, as well as a"
20708,PIG.,"farmer. Nafferton watched him, and thought about the horse. Nafferton"
20709,PIG.,"said:--""See me chase that boy till he drops!"" I said:--""You can't get"
20710,PIG.,"your knife into an Assistant Commissioner."" Nafferton told me that I did"
20711,PIG.,not understand the administration of the Province.
20712,PIG.,
20713,PIG.,Our Government is rather peculiar. It gushes on the agricultural and
20714,PIG.,"general information side, and will supply a moderately respectable man"
20715,PIG.,"with all sorts of ""economic statistics,"" if he speaks to it prettily."
20716,PIG.,"For instance, you are interested in gold-washing in the sands of the"
20717,PIG.,"Sutlej. You pull the string, and find that it wakes up half a dozen"
20718,PIG.,"Departments, and finally communicates, say, with a friend of yours"
20719,PIG.,"in the Telegraph, who once wrote some notes on the customs of the"
20720,PIG.,gold-washers when he was on construction-work in their part of the
20721,PIG.,Empire. He may or may not be pleased at being ordered to write out
20722,PIG.,everything he knows for your benefit. This depends on his temperament.
20723,PIG.,"The bigger man you are, the more information and the greater trouble can"
20724,PIG.,you raise.
20725,PIG.,
20726,PIG.,Nafferton was not a big man; but he had the reputation of being very
20727,PIG.,"""earnest."" An ""earnest"" man can do much with a Government. There was"
20728,PIG.,an earnest man who once nearly wrecked... but all India knows THAT
20729,PIG.,"story. I am not sure what real ""earnestness"" is. A very fair imitation"
20730,PIG.,"can be manufactured by neglecting to dress decently, by mooning about in"
20731,PIG.,"a dreamy, misty sort of way, by taking office-work home after staying"
20732,PIG.,"in office till seven, and by receiving crowds of native gentlemen on"
20733,PIG.,"Sundays. That is one sort of ""earnestness."""
20734,PIG.,
20735,PIG.,"Nafferton cast about for a peg whereon to hang his earnestness, and for"
20736,PIG.,a string that would communicate with Pinecoffin. He found both.
20737,PIG.,
20738,PIG.,They were Pig. Nafferton became an earnest inquirer after Pig. He
20739,PIG.,informed the Government that he had a scheme whereby a very large
20740,PIG.,"percentage of the British Army in India could be fed, at a very large"
20741,PIG.,"saving, on Pig. Then he hinted that Pinecoffin might supply him with the"
20742,PIG.,"""varied information necessary to the proper inception of the scheme."""
20743,PIG.,"So the Government wrote on the back of the letter:--""Instruct Mr."
20744,PIG.,"Pinecoffin to furnish Mr. Nafferton with any information in his power."""
20745,PIG.,Government is very prone to writing things on the backs of letters
20746,PIG.,"which, later, lead to trouble and confusion."
20747,PIG.,
20748,PIG.,"Nafferton had not the faintest interest in Pig, but he knew that"
20749,PIG.,Pinecoffin would flounce into the trap. Pinecoffin was delighted at
20750,PIG.,being consulted about Pig. The Indian Pig is not exactly an important
20751,PIG.,factor in agricultural life; but Nafferton explained to Pinecoffin that
20752,PIG.,"there was room for improvement, and corresponded direct with that young"
20753,PIG.,man.
20754,PIG.,
20755,PIG.,You may think that there is not much to be evolved from Pig. It all
20756,PIG.,depends how you set to work. Pinecoffin being a Civilian and wishing
20757,PIG.,"to do things thoroughly, began with an essay on the Primitive Pig, the"
20758,PIG.,"Mythology of the Pig, and the Dravidian Pig."
20759,PIG.,
20760,PIG.,Nafferton filed that information--twenty-seven foolscap sheets--and
20761,PIG.,"wanted to know about the distribution of the Pig in the Punjab, and"
20762,PIG.,"how it stood the Plains in the hot weather. From this point onwards,"
20763,PIG.,remember that I am giving you only the barest outlines of the
20764,PIG.,"affair--the guy-ropes, as it were, of the web that Nafferton spun round"
20765,PIG.,Pinecoffin.
20766,PIG.,
20767,PIG.,"Pinecoffin made a colored Pig-population map, and collected observations"
20768,PIG.,on the comparative longevity of the Pig (a) in the sub-montane tracts of
20769,PIG.,"the Himalayas, and (b) in the Rechna Doab."
20770,PIG.,
20771,PIG.,"Nafferton filed that, and asked what sort of people looked after Pig."
20772,PIG.,"This started an ethnological excursus on swineherds, and drew from"
20773,PIG.,Pinecoffin long tables showing the proportion per thousand of the caste
20774,PIG.,"in the Derajat. Nafferton filed that bundle, and explained that the"
20775,PIG.,"figures which he wanted referred to the Cis-Sutlej states, where he"
20776,PIG.,"understood that Pigs were very fine and large, and where he proposed"
20777,PIG.,"to start a Piggery. By this time, Government had quite forgotten their"
20778,PIG.,instructions to Mr. Pinecoffin.
20779,PIG.,
20780,PIG.,"They were like the gentlemen, in Keats' poem, who turned well-oiled"
20781,PIG.,wheels to skin other people. But Pinecoffin was just entering into the
20782,PIG.,"spirit of the Pig-hunt, as Nafferton well knew he would do. He had a"
20783,PIG.,fair amount of work of his own to clear away; but he sat up of nights
20784,PIG.,reducing Pig to five places of decimals for the honor of his Service. He
20785,PIG.,was not going to appear ignorant of so easy a subject as Pig.
20786,PIG.,
20787,PIG.,"Then Government sent him on special duty to Kohat, to ""inquire into"""
20788,PIG.,"the big-seven-foot, iron-shod spades of that District. People had been"
20789,PIG.,killing each other with those peaceful tools; and Government wished
20790,PIG.,"to know ""whether a modified form of agricultural implement could"
20791,PIG.,"not, tentatively and as a temporary measure, be introduced among the"
20792,PIG.,agricultural population without needlessly or unduly exasperating the
20793,PIG.,"existing religious sentiments of the peasantry."""
20794,PIG.,
20795,PIG.,"Between those spades and Nafferton's Pig, Pinecoffin was rather heavily"
20796,PIG.,burdened.
20797,PIG.,
20798,PIG.,"Nafferton now began to take up ""(a) The food-supply of the indigenous Pig,"
20799,PIG.,with a view to the improvement of its capacities as a flesh-former.
20800,PIG.,"(b) The acclimatization of the exotic Pig, maintaining its distinctive"
20801,PIG.,"peculiarities."" Pinecoffin replied exhaustively that the exotic Pig"
20802,PIG.,would become merged in the indigenous type; and quoted horse-breeding
20803,PIG.,statistics to prove this.
20804,PIG.,
20805,PIG.,"The side-issue was debated, at great length on Pinecoffin's side, till"
20806,PIG.,"Nafferton owned that he had been in the wrong, and moved the previous"
20807,PIG.,question. When Pinecoffin had quite written himself out about
20808,PIG.,"flesh-formers, and fibrins, and glucose and the nitrogenous constituents"
20809,PIG.,"of maize and lucerne, Nafferton raised the question of expense. By this"
20810,PIG.,"time Pinecoffin, who had been transferred from Kohat, had developed a"
20811,PIG.,"Pig theory of his own, which he stated in thirty-three folio pages--all"
20812,PIG.,carefully filed by Nafferton. Who asked for more.
20813,PIG.,
20814,PIG.,"These things took ten months, and Pinecoffin's interest in the potential"
20815,PIG.,Piggery seemed to die down after he had stated his own views. But
20816,PIG.,"Nafferton bombarded him with letters on ""the Imperial aspect of"
20817,PIG.,"the scheme, as tending to officialize the sale of pork, and thereby"
20818,PIG.,"calculated to give offence to the Mahomedan population of Upper India."""
20819,PIG.,"He guessed that Pinecoffin would want some broad, free-hand work after"
20820,PIG.,"his niggling, stippling, decimal details."
20821,PIG.,
20822,PIG.,Pinecoffin handled the latest development of the case in masterly
20823,PIG.,"style, and proved that no ""popular ebullition of excitement was to"
20824,PIG.,"be apprehended."" Nafferton said that there was nothing like Civilian"
20825,PIG.,"insight in matters of this kind, and lured him up a bye-path--""the"
20826,PIG.,possible profits to accrue to the Government from the sale of
20827,PIG.,"hog-bristles."" There is an extensive literature of hog-bristles, and the"
20828,PIG.,"shoe, brush, and colorman's trades recognize more varieties of bristles"
20829,PIG.,than you would think possible. After Pinecoffin had wondered a little
20830,PIG.,"at Nafferton's rage for information, he sent back a monograph, fifty-one"
20831,PIG.,"pages, on ""Products of the Pig."" This led him, under Nafferton's tender"
20832,PIG.,"handling, straight to the Cawnpore factories, the trade in hog-skin"
20833,PIG.,for saddles--and thence to the tanners. Pinecoffin wrote that
20834,PIG.,"pomegranate-seed was the best cure for hog-skin, and suggested--for the"
20835,PIG.,"past fourteen months had wearied him--that Nafferton should ""raise his"
20836,PIG.,"pigs before he tanned them."""
20837,PIG.,
20838,PIG.,Nafferton went back to the second section of his fifth question.
20839,PIG.,
20840,PIG.,How could the exotic Pig be brought to give as much pork as it did in
20841,PIG.,"the West and yet ""assume the essentially hirsute characteristics of its"
20842,PIG.,"oriental congener?"" Pinecoffin felt dazed, for he had forgotten what"
20843,PIG.,"he had written sixteen month's before, and fancied that he was about"
20844,PIG.,to reopen the entire question. He was too far involved in the hideous
20845,PIG.,"tangle to retreat, and, in a weak moment, he wrote:--""Consult my first"
20846,PIG.,"letter."" Which related to the Dravidian Pig. As a matter of fact,"
20847,PIG.,Pinecoffin had still to reach the acclimatization stage; having gone off
20848,PIG.,on a side-issue on the merging of types.
20849,PIG.,
20850,PIG.,THEN Nafferton really unmasked his batteries! He complained to the
20851,PIG.,"Government, in stately language, of ""the paucity of help accorded to me"
20852,PIG.,"in my earnest attempts to start a potentially remunerative industry, and"
20853,PIG.,the flippancy with which my requests for information are treated by a
20854,PIG.,gentleman whose pseudo-scholarly attainments should at lest have taught
20855,PIG.,him the primary differences between the Dravidian and the Berkshire
20856,PIG.,variety of the genus Sus. If I am to understand that the letter to which
20857,PIG.,he refers me contains his serious views on the acclimatization of a
20858,PIG.,"valuable, though possibly uncleanly, animal, I am reluctantly compelled"
20859,PIG.,"to believe,"" etc., etc."
20860,PIG.,
20861,PIG.,There was a new man at the head of the Department of Castigation.
20862,PIG.,
20863,PIG.,The wretched Pinecoffin was told that the Service was made for the
20864,PIG.,"Country, and not the Country for the Service, and that he had better"
20865,PIG.,begin to supply information about Pigs.
20866,PIG.,
20867,PIG.,Pinecoffin answered insanely that he had written everything that could
20868,PIG.,"be written about Pig, and that some furlough was due to him."
20869,PIG.,
20870,PIG.,"Nafferton got a copy of that letter, and sent it, with the essay on the"
20871,PIG.,"Dravidian Pig, to a down-country paper, which printed both in full. The"
20872,PIG.,essay was rather highflown; but if the Editor had seen the stacks of
20873,PIG.,"paper, in Pinecoffin's handwriting, on Nafferton's table, he would not"
20874,PIG.,"have been so sarcastic about the ""nebulous discursiveness and blatant"
20875,PIG.,"self-sufficiency of the modern Competition-wallah, and his utter"
20876,PIG.,"inability to grasp the practical issues of a practical question."" Many"
20877,PIG.,friends cut out these remarks and sent them to Pinecoffin.
20878,PIG.,
20879,PIG.,I have already stated that Pinecoffin came of a soft stock. This last
20880,PIG.,stroke frightened and shook him. He could not understand it; but he felt
20881,PIG.,"he had been, somehow, shamelessly betrayed by Nafferton."
20882,PIG.,
20883,PIG.,"He realized that he had wrapped himself up in the Pigskin without need,"
20884,PIG.,and that he could not well set himself right with his Government. All
20885,PIG.,"his acquaintances asked after his ""nebulous discursiveness"" or his"
20886,PIG.,"""blatant self-sufficiency,"" and this made him miserable."
20887,PIG.,
20888,PIG.,"He took a train and went to Nafferton, whom he had not seen since"
20889,PIG.,"the Pig business began. He also took the cutting from the paper, and"
20890,PIG.,"blustered feebly and called Nafferton names, and then died down to a"
20891,PIG.,"watery, weak protest of the ""I-say-it's-too-bad-you-know"" order."
20892,PIG.,
20893,PIG.,Nafferton was very sympathetic.
20894,PIG.,
20895,PIG.,"""I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?"" said he."
20896,PIG.,
20897,PIG.,"""Trouble!"" whimpered Pinecoffin; ""I don't mind the trouble so much,"
20898,PIG.,though that was bad enough; but what I resent is this showing up in
20899,PIG.,print. It will stick to me like a burr all through my service. And I DID
20900,PIG.,"do my best for your interminable swine. It's too bad of you, on my soul"
20901,PIG.,"it is!"""
20902,PIG.,
20903,PIG.,"""I don't know,"" said Nafferton; ""have you ever been stuck with a horse?"
20904,PIG.,"It isn't the money I mind, though that is bad enough; but what I resent"
20905,PIG.,"is the chaff that follows, especially from the boy who stuck me. But I"
20906,PIG.,"think we'll cry quite now."""
20907,PIG.,
20908,PIG.,Pinecoffin found nothing to say save bad words; and Nafferton smiled
20909,PIG.,"ever so sweetly, and asked him to dinner."

20948,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Regiment was not smart enough. This to the White Hussars, who knew they"
20949,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"could walk round any Horse and through any Guns, and over any Foot on"
20950,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,the face of the earth! That insult was the first cause of offence.
20951,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20952,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Then the Colonel cast the Drum-Horse--the Drum-Horse of the White
20953,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Hussars! Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had
20954,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,committed. I will try to make it clear. The soul of the Regiment lives
20955,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"in the Drum-Horse, who carries the silver kettle-drums. He is nearly"
20956,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,always a big piebald Waler. That is a point of honor; and a Regiment
20957,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,will spend anything you please on a piebald. He is beyond the ordinary
20958,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"laws of casting. His work is very light, and he only manoeuvres at a"
20959,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"foot-pace. Wherefore, so long as he can step out and look handsome,"
20960,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,his well-being is assured. He knows more about the Regiment than the
20961,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Adjutant, and could not make a mistake if he tried."
20962,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20963,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The Drum-Horse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old, and"
20964,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,perfectly equal to his duties. He had at least six years' more work in
20965,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"him, and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a Drum-Major"
20966,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"of the Guards. The Regiment had paid Rs. 1,200 for him."
20967,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20968,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"But the Colonel said that he must go, and he was cast in due form and"
20969,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"replaced by a washy, bay beast as ugly as a mule, with a ewe-neck,"
20970,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"rat-tail, and cow-hocks. The Drummer detested that animal, and the best"
20971,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,of the Band-horses put back their ears and showed the whites of their
20972,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,eyes at the very sight of him. They knew him for an upstart and no
20973,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,gentleman. I fancy that the Colonel's ideas of smartness extended to
20974,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"the Band, and that he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade"
20975,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,movements. A Cavalry Band is a sacred thing. It only turns out for
20976,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Commanding Officers' parades, and the Band Master is one degree more"
20977,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"important than the Colonel. He is a High Priest and the ""Keel Row"" is"
20978,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"his holy song. The ""Keel Row"" is the Cavalry Trot; and the man who has"
20979,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"never heard that tune rising, high and shrill, above the rattle of the"
20980,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Regiment going past the saluting-base, has something yet to hear and"
20981,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,understand.
20982,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20983,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"When the Colonel cast the Drum-horse of the White Hussars, there was"
20984,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,nearly a mutiny.
20985,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20986,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The officers were angry, the Regiment were furious, and the Bandsman"
20987,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,swore--like troopers. The Drum-Horse was going to be put up to
20988,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"auction--public auction--to be bought, perhaps, by a Parsee and put into"
20989,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,a cart! It was worse than exposing the inner life of the Regiment to the
20990,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"whole world, or selling the Mess Plate to a Jew--a black Jew."
20991,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20992,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,The Colonel was a mean man and a bully. He knew what the Regiment
20993,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"thought about his action; and, when the troopers offered to buy the"
20994,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Drum-Horse, he said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the"
20995,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Regulations.
20996,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
20997,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"But one of the Subalterns--Hogan-Yale, an Irishman--bought the"
20998,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Drum-Horse for Rs. 160 at the sale; and the Colonel was wroth. Yale
20999,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"professed repentance--he was unnaturally submissive--and said that,"
21000,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible
21001,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"ill-treatment and starvation, he would now shoot him and end the"
21002,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"business. This appeared to soothe the Colonel, for he wanted the"
21003,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Drum-Horse disposed of. He felt that he had made a mistake, and could"
21004,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"not of course acknowledge it. Meantime, the presence of the Drum-Horse"
21005,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,was an annoyance to him.
21006,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21007,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy, three cheroots, and his"
21008,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"friend, Martyn; and they all left the Mess together. Yale and Martyn"
21009,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,conferred for two hours in Yale's quarters; but only the bull-terrier
21010,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"who keeps watch over Yale's boot-trees knows what they said. A horse,"
21011,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"hooded and sheeted to his ears, left Yale's stables and was taken, very"
21012,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"unwillingly, into the Civil Lines. Yale's groom went with him. Two men"
21013,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paint-pots and some
21014,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"large scenery brushes. Then night fell over the Cantonments, and there"
21015,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,was a noise as of a horse kicking his loose-box to pieces in Yale's
21016,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"stables. Yale had a big, old, white Waler trap-horse."
21017,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21018,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The next day was a Thursday, and the men, hearing that Yale was going"
21019,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"to shoot the Drum-Horse in the evening, determined to give the beast a"
21020,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,regular regimental funeral--a finer one than they would have given the
21021,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Colonel had he died just then. They got a bullock-cart and some sacking,"
21022,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"and mounds and mounds of roses, and the body, under sacking, was carried"
21023,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated; two-thirds of
21024,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"the Regiment followed. There was no Band, but they all sang ""The Place"
21025,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"where the old Horse died"" as something respectful and appropriate to the"
21026,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,occasion. When the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began
21027,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it, the Farrier-Sergeant ripped"
21028,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"out an oath and said aloud:--""Why, it ain't the Drum-Horse any more than"
21029,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"it's me!"" The Troop-Sergeant-Majors asked him whether he had left"
21030,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,his head in the Canteen. The Farrier-Sergeant said that he knew the
21031,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Drum-Horse's feet as well as he knew his own; but he was silenced
21032,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"when he saw the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff, upturned"
21033,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,near-fore.
21034,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21035,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Thus was the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars buried; the
21036,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Farrier-Sergeant grumbling. The sacking that covered the corpse was
21037,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,smeared in places with black paint; and the Farrier-Sergeant drew
21038,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,attention to this fact. But the Troop-Sergeant-Major of E Troop kicked
21039,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"him severely on the shin, and told him that he was undoubtedly drunk."
21040,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21041,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"On the Monday following the burial, the Colonel sought revenge on the"
21042,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"White Hussars. Unfortunately, being at that time temporarily in Command"
21043,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"of the Station, he ordered a Brigade field-day. He said that he wished"
21044,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"to make the regiment ""sweat for their damned insolence,"" and he carried"
21045,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,out his notion thoroughly. That Monday was one of the hardest days in
21046,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,the memory of the White Hussars.
21047,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21048,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"They were thrown against a skeleton-enemy, and pushed forward, and"
21049,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"withdrawn, and dismounted, and ""scientifically handled"" in every"

21051,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21052,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Their only amusement came late in the day, when they fell upon the"
21053,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,battery of Horse Artillery and chased it for two mile's. This was a
21054,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"personal question, and most of the troopers had money on the event; the"
21055,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the White Hussars. They
21056,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"were wrong. A march-past concluded the campaign, and when the Regiment"
21057,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"got back to their Lines, the men were coated with dirt from spur to"
21058,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,chin-strap.
21059,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21060,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege. They won it at
21061,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Fontenoy, I think."
21062,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21063,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Many Regiments possess special rights, such as wearing collars with"
21064,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"undress uniform, or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders, or red and"
21065,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year. Some
21066,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"rights are connected with regimental saints, and some with regimental"
21067,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,successes. All are valued highly; but none so highly as the right of
21068,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,the White Hussars to have the Band playing when their horses are being
21069,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"watered in the Lines. Only one tune is played, and that tune never"
21070,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"varies. I don't know its real name, but the White Hussars call"
21071,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"it:--""Take me to London again."" It sounds very pretty. The Regiment"
21072,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction.
21073,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21074,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"After the ""dismiss"" was sounded, the officers rode off home to prepare"
21075,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"for stables; and the men filed into the lines, riding easy."
21076,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21077,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"That is to say, they opened their tight buttons, shifted their helmets,"
21078,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,and began to joke or to swear as the humor took them; the more careful
21079,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,slipping off and easing girths and curbs. A good trooper values his

21081,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"believe, that the two together are irresistible where women or men,"

21083,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21084,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Then the Orderly-Officer gave the order:--""Water horses,"" and the"
21085,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Regiment loafed off to the squadron-troughs, which were in rear of"
21086,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,the stables and between these and the barracks. There were four huge
21087,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"troughs, one for each squadron, arranged en echelon, so that the whole"
21088,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Regiment could water in ten minutes if it liked. But it lingered for
21089,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"seventeen, as a rule, while the Band played."
21090,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21091,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,The band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men
21092,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other.
21093,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21094,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The sun was just setting in a big, hot bed of red cloud, and the road to"

21096,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21097,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,There was a little dot on the road. It grew and grew till it showed as
21098,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"a horse, with a sort of gridiron thing on his back. The red cloud glared"
21099,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,through the bars of the gridiron. Some of the troopers shaded their eyes
21100,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"with their hands and said:--""What the mischief as that there 'orse got"

21102,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21103,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,In another minute they heard a neigh that every soul--horse and man--in
21104,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"the Regiment knew, and saw, heading straight towards the Band, the dead"
21105,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Drum-Horse of the White Hussars!
21106,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21107,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"On his withers banged and bumped the kettle-drums draped in crape, and"
21108,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"on his back, very stiff and soldierly, sat a bare-headed skeleton."
21109,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21110,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The band stopped playing, and, for a moment, there was a hush."
21111,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21112,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Then some one in E troop--men said it was the
21113,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Troop-Sergeant-Major--swung his horse round and yelled. No one can
21114,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"account exactly for what happened afterwards; but it seems that, at"
21115,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"least, one man in each troop set an example of panic, and the rest"
21116,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,followed like sheep. The horses that had barely put their muzzles into
21117,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"the trough's reared and capered; but, as soon as the Band broke, which"
21118,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"it did when the ghost of the Drum-Horse was about a furlong distant, all"
21119,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"hooves followed suit, and the clatter of the stampede--quite different"
21120,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade, or the rough"
21121,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,horse-play of watering in camp--made them only more terrified. They felt
21122,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,that the men on their backs were afraid of something. When horses once
21123,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"know THAT, all is over except the butchery."
21124,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21125,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Troop after troop turned from the troughs and ran--anywhere, and"
21126,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,everywhere--like spilt quicksilver. It was a most extraordinary
21127,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"spectacle, for men and horses were in all stages of easiness, and the"
21128,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,carbine-buckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on. Men
21129,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"were shouting and cursing, and trying to pull clear of the Band which"
21130,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,was being chased by the Drum-Horse whose rider had fallen forward and
21131,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,seemed to be spurring for a wager.
21132,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21133,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink. Most of the officers
21134,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"were with him, and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down"
21135,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"to the lines, and receive the watering reports from the Troop-Sergeant"
21136,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Majors. When ""Take me to London again"" stopped, after twenty bars, every"
21137,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"one in the Mess said:--""What on earth has happened?"" A minute later,"
21138,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"they heard unmilitary noises, and saw, far across the plain, the White"

21140,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21141,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The Colonel was speechless with rage, for he thought that the Regiment"
21142,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"had risen against him or was unanimously drunk. The Band, a disorganized"
21143,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"mob, tore past, and at its heels labored the Drum-Horse--the dead and"
21144,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"buried Drum-Horse--with the jolting, clattering skeleton. Hogan-Yale"
21145,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"whispered softly to Martyn:--""No wire will stand that treatment,"" and"
21146,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"the Band, which had doubled like a hare, came back again. But the rest"
21147,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"of the Regiment was gone, was rioting all over the Province, for the"
21148,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the

21150,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21151,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Troop-Horses are far too tenderly treated as a rule. They can, on"

21153,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,As the troopers found out.
21154,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21155,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,How long this panic lasted I cannot say. I believe that when the moon

21157,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"and half-troops, crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of"
21158,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"themselves. Meantime, the Drum-Horse, disgusted at his treatment by"
21159,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"old friends, pulled up, wheeled round, and trotted up to the Mess"
21160,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,verandah-steps for bread. No one liked to run; but no one cared to go
21161,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,forward till the Colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeleton's
21162,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"foot. The Band had halted some distance away, and now came back slowly."
21163,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The Colonel called it, individually and collectively, every evil name"
21164,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,that occurred to him at the time; for he had set his hand on the
21165,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,bosom of the Drum-Horse and found flesh and blood. Then he beat the
21166,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"kettle-drums with his clenched fist, and discovered that they were but"
21167,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"made of silvered paper and bamboo. Next, still swearing, he tried to"
21168,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"drag the skeleton out of the saddle, but found that it had been wired"
21169,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"into the cantle. The sight of the Colonel, with his arms round the"
21170,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"skeleton's pelvis and his knee in the old Drum-Horse's stomach, was"
21171,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,striking. Not to say amusing. He worried the thing off in a minute or
21172,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"two, and threw it down on the ground, saying to the Band:--""Here, you"
21173,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"curs, that's what you're afraid of."" The skeleton did not look pretty in"
21174,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"the twilight. The Band-Sergeant seemed to recognize it, for he began to"
21175,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"chuckle and choke. ""Shall I take it away, sir?"" said the Band-Sergeant."
21176,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"""Yes,"" said the Colonel, ""take it to Hell, and ride there yourselves!"""
21177,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21178,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"The Band-Sergeant saluted, hoisted the skeleton across his saddle-bow,"
21179,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,and led off to the stables. Then the Colonel began to make inquiries
21180,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"for the rest of the Regiment, and the language he used was wonderful. He"
21181,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,would disband the Regiment--he would court-martial every soul in it--he
21182,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"would not command such a set of rabble, and so on, and so on. As the"
21183,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"men dropped in, his language grew wilder, until at last it exceeded the"
21184,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,utmost limits of free speech allowed even to a Colonel of Horse.
21185,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21186,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Martyn took Hogan-Yale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from
21187,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,the service as a necessity when all was discovered. Martyn was the
21188,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"weaker man of the two, Hogan-Yale put up his eyebrows and remarked,"
21189,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"firstly, that he was the son of a Lord, and secondly, that he was"
21190,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,as innocent as the babe unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the

21192,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21193,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"""My instructions,"" said Yale, with a singularly sweet smile, ""were that"

21198,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21199,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,"Martyn said:--""you are a great man and will in time become a General;"

21201,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,
21202,THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS.,Providence saved Martyn and Hogan-Yale. The Second-in-Command led the

21296,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Would to God that she or I had died!
21297,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,--Confessions.
21298,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21299,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"There was a man called Bronckhorst--a three-cornered, middle-aged man"
21300,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"in the Army--gray as a badger, and, some people said, with a touch of"
21301,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"country-blood in him. That, however, cannot be proved."
21302,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21303,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Mrs. Bronckhorst was not exactly young, though fifteen years younger"
21304,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"than her husband. She was a large, pale, quiet woman, with heavy"
21305,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"eyelids, over weak eyes, and hair that turned red or yellow as the"
21306,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,lights fell on it.
21307,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21308,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Bronckhorst was not nice in any way. He had no respect for the pretty
21309,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is.
21310,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,His manner towards his wife was coarse. There are many things--including
21311,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,actual assault with the clenched fist--that a wife will endure; but
21312,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,seldom a wife can bear--as Mrs. Bronckhorst bore--with a long course of
21313,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"brutal, hard chaff, making light of her weaknesses, her headaches, her"
21314,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"small fits of gaiety, her dresses, her queer little attempts to make"
21315,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she is not
21316,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"what she has been, and--worst of all--the love that she spends on her"
21317,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,children. That particular sort of heavy-handed jest was specially dear
21318,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"to Bronckhorst. I suppose that he had first slipped into it, meaning"
21319,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"no harm, in the honeymoon, when folk find their ordinary stock of"
21320,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"endearments run short, and so go to the other extreme to express their"
21321,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"feelings. A similar impulse makes a man say:--""Hutt, you old beast!"""
21322,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"when a favorite horse nuzzles his coat-front. Unluckily, when the"
21323,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"reaction of marriage sets in, the form of speech remains, and, the"
21324,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"tenderness having died out, hurts the wife more than she cares to say."

21326,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21327,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Perhaps that was why he objected to her. Perhaps--this is only a theory
21328,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,to account for his infamous behavior later on--he gave way to the queer
21329,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband twenty
21330,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"years' married, when he sees, across the table, the same face of"
21331,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"his wedded wife, and knows that, as he has sat facing it, so must he"

21336,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"rather worse than they are now, and is too unpleasant to be discussed."
21337,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21338,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Dinner at the Bronckhorst's was an infliction few men cared to undergo.
21339,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince.
21340,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"When their little boy came in at dessert, Bronckhorst used to give him"
21341,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"half a glass of wine, and naturally enough, the poor little mite got"
21342,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"first riotous, next miserable, and was removed screaming. Bronckhorst"
21343,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"asked if that was the way Teddy usually behaved, and whether Mrs."
21344,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Bronckhorst could not spare some of her time to teach the ""little beggar"

21346,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,tried not to cry--her spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage.
21347,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Lastly, Bronckhorst used to say:--""There! That'll do, that'll do."
21348,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,For God's sake try to behave like a rational woman. Go into the
21349,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"drawing-room."" Mrs. Bronckhorst would go, trying to carry it all"

21351,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,uncomfortable.
21352,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21353,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,After three years of this cheerful life--for Mrs. Bronckhorst had no
21354,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,woman-friends to talk to--the Station was startled by the news that
21355,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Bronckhorst had instituted proceedings ON THE CRIMINAL COUNT, against"
21356,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"a man called Biel, who certainly had been rather attentive to Mrs."
21357,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public. The utter want of
21358,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,reserve with which Bronckhorst treated his own dishonor helped us to
21359,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,know that the evidence against Biel would be entirely circumstantial and
21360,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,native. There were no letters; but Bronckhorst said openly that he would
21361,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,rack Heaven and Earth until he saw Biel superintending the manufacture
21362,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,of carpets in the Central Jail. Mrs. Bronckhorst kept entirely to her
21363,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"house, and let charitable folks say what they pleased. Opinions were"
21364,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,divided. Some two-thirds of the Station jumped at once to the conclusion
21365,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,that Biel was guilty; but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by
21366,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"him. Biel was furious and surprised. He denied the whole thing, and"
21367,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,vowed that he would thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life.
21368,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"No jury, we knew, could convict a man on the criminal count on native"
21369,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"evidence in a land where you can buy a murder-charge, including the"
21370,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"corpse, all complete for fifty-four rupees; but Biel did not care to"
21371,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,scrape through by the benefit of a doubt. He wanted the whole thing
21372,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"cleared: but as he said one night:--""He can prove anything with"
21373,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"servants' evidence, and I've only my bare word."" This was about a month"
21374,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"before the case came on; and beyond agreeing with Biel, we could do"
21375,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,little. All that we could be sure of was that the native evidence would
21376,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,be bad enough to blast Biel's character for the rest of his service; for
21377,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly. He does not
21378,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,boggle over details.
21379,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21380,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked

21383,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21384,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line. He had
21385,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"not long been married to Miss Youghal, but he scented in the telegram a"
21386,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"chance of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after,"
21387,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,and next night he came in and heard our story. He finished his pipe and
21388,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"said oracularly:--""We must get at the evidence. Oorya bearer, Mussalman"
21389,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"khit and methraniayah, I suppose, are the pillars of the charge. I am on"

21391,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21392,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"He rose and went into Biel's bedroom where his trunk had been put, and"
21393,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"shut the door. An hour later, we heard him say:--""I hadn't the heart"
21394,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"to part with my old makeups when I married. Will this do?"" There was a"
21395,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,lothely faquir salaaming in the doorway.
21396,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21397,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"""Now lend me fifty rupees,"" said Strickland, ""and give me your Words of"

21399,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21400,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"He got all that he asked for, and left the house while the table drank"

21402,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Bronckhorst's compound for twelve days. Then a mehter appeared, and when"
21403,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Biel heard of HIM, he said that Strickland was an angel full-fledged."
21404,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Whether the mehter made love to Janki, Mrs. Bronckhorst's ayah, is a"

21406,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21407,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"He came back at the end of three weeks, and said quietly:--""You spoke"
21408,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"the truth, Biel. The whole business is put up from beginning to end."
21409,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,Jove! It almost astonishes ME! That Bronckhorst-beast isn't fit to

21411,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21412,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"There was uproar and shouting, and Biel said:--""How are you going to"

21415,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21416,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"""No,"" said Strickland. ""Tell your lawyer-fool, whoever he is, to get up"

21419,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"to run this business."""
21420,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21421,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Biel held his tongue, and the other men waited to see what would happen."
21422,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,They trusted Strickland as men trust quiet men. When the case came off
21423,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,the Court was crowded. Strickland hung about in the verandah of the
21424,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Court, till he met the Mohammedan khitmatgar. Then he murmured a"
21425,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"faquir's blessing in his ear, and asked him how his second wife did. The"
21426,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"man spun round, and, as he looked into the eyes of ""Estreeken Sahib,"""
21427,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"his jaw dropped. You must remember that before Strickland was married,"
21428,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"he was, as I have told you already, a power among natives. Strickland"
21429,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,whispered a rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect that he was
21430,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"abreast of all that was going on, and went into the Court armed with a"
21431,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,gut trainer's-whip.
21432,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21433,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,The Mohammedan was the first witness and Strickland beamed upon him from
21434,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"the back of the Court. The man moistened his lips with his tongue and,"
21435,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"in his abject fear of ""Estreeken Sahib"" the faquir, went back on every"
21436,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,detail of his evidence--said he was a poor man and God was his witness
21437,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,that he had forgotten every thing that Bronckhorst Sahib had told him
21438,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"to say. Between his terror of Strickland, the Judge, and Bronckhorst he"
21439,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"collapsed, weeping."
21440,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21441,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Then began the panic among the witnesses. Janki, the ayah, leering"
21442,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"chastely behind her veil, turned gray, and the bearer left the Court. He"

21450,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21451,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Bronckhorst's Counsel saw the look on his client's face, and without"
21452,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"more ado, pitched his papers on the little green baize table, and"

21457,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Biel came out of the place, and Strickland dropped a gut trainer's-whip"

21459,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"ribbons behind the old Court cells, quietly and without scandal. What"
21460,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,was left of Bronckhorst was sent home in a carriage; and his wife wept
21461,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,over it and nursed it into a man again.
21462,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21463,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Later on, after Biel had managed to hush up the counter-charge against"
21464,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Bronckhorst of fabricating false evidence, Mrs. Bronckhorst, with her"
21465,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"faint watery smile, said that there had been a mistake, but it wasn't"
21466,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,her Teddy's fault altogether. She would wait till her Teddy came back to
21467,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"her. Perhaps he had grown tired of her, or she had tried his patience,"
21468,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"and perhaps we wouldn't cut her any more, and perhaps the mothers would"
21469,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"let their children play with ""little Teddy"" again. He was so lonely."
21470,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"Then the Station invited Mrs. Bronckhorst everywhere, until Bronckhorst"
21471,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"was fit to appear in public, when he went Home and took his wife with"
21472,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"him. According to the latest advices, her Teddy did ""come back to her,"""
21473,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"and they are moderately happy. Though, of course, he can never forgive"
21474,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,her the thrashing that she was the indirect means of getting for him..

21477,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"What Biel wants to know is:--""Why didn't I press home the charge against"
21478,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"the Bronckhorst-brute, and have him run in?"""
21479,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,
21480,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"What Mrs. Strickland wants to know is:--""How DID my husband bring such"
21481,THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE-CASE.,"a lovely, lovely Waler from your Station? I know ALL his money-affairs;"

21493,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21494,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,And the years went on as the years must do;
21495,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,But our great Diana was always new--
21496,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Fresh, and blooming, and blonde, and fair,"
21497,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,With azure eyes and with aureate hair;
21498,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"And all the folk, as they came or went,"
21499,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Offered her praise to her heart's content.
21500,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,--Diana of Ephesus.
21501,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21502,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,She had nothing to do with Number Eighteen in the Braccio Nuovo of
21503,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"the Vatican, between Visconti's Ceres and the God of the Nile. She was"
21504,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"purely an Indian deity--an Anglo-Indian deity, that is to say--and"
21505,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"we called her THE Venus Annodomini, to distinguish her from other"
21506,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Annodominis of the same everlasting order. There was a legend among the
21507,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Hills that she had once been young; but no living man was prepared to
21508,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,come forward and say boldly that the legend was true.
21509,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21510,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Men rode up to Simla, and stayed, and went away and made their name and"
21511,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"did their life's work, and returned again to find the Venus Annodomini"
21512,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,exactly as they had left her. She was as immutable as the Hills. But
21513,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,not quite so green. All that a girl of eighteen could do in the way of
21514,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"riding, walking, dancing, picnicking and over-exertion generally,"
21515,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"the Venus Annodomini did, and showed no sign of fatigue or trace of"
21516,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"weariness. Besides perpetual youth, she had discovered, men said, the"
21517,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,secret of perpetual health; and her fame spread about the land. From a
21518,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"mere woman, she grew to be an Institution, insomuch that no young"
21519,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"man could be said to be properly formed, who had not, at some time or"
21520,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"another, worshipped at the shrine of the Venus Annodomini. There was no"
21521,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"one like her, though there were many imitations. Six years in her"
21522,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,eyes were no more than six months to ordinary women; and ten made less
21523,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,visible impression on her than does a week's fever on an ordinary woman.
21524,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Every one adored her, and in return she was pleasant and courteous to"
21525,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"nearly every one. Youth had been a habit of hers for so long, that"
21526,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"she could not part with it--never realized, in fact, the necessity of"
21527,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,parting with it--and took for her more chosen associates young people.
21528,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21529,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Among the worshippers of the Venus Annodomini was young Gayerson.
21530,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21531,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson, he was called to distinguish him from his father"
21532,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Young"" Gayerson, a Bengal Civilian, who affected the customs--as he had"
21533,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"the heart--of youth. ""Very Young"" Gayerson was not content to worship"
21534,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"placidly and for form's sake, as the other young men did, or to accept"
21535,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"a ride or a dance, or a talk from the Venus Annodomini in a properly"
21536,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"humble and thankful spirit. He was exacting, and, therefore, the Venus"
21537,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Annodomini repressed him. He worried himself nearly sick in a futile
21538,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,sort of way over her; and his devotion and earnestness made him appear
21539,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"either shy or boisterous or rude, as his mood might vary, by the side of"
21540,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"the older men who, with him, bowed before the Venus Annodomini. She was"
21541,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"sorry for him. He reminded her of a lad who, three-and-twenty years ago,"
21542,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"had professed a boundless devotion for her, and for whom in return she"
21543,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,had felt something more than a week's weakness. But that lad had fallen
21544,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,away and married another woman less than a year after he had worshipped
21545,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,her; and the Venus Annodomini had almost--not quite--forgotten his name.
21546,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson had the same big blue eyes and the same way of"
21547,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,pouting his underlip when he was excited or troubled. But the Venus
21548,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Annodomini checked him sternly none the less. Too much zeal was a thing
21549,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"that she did not approve of; preferring instead, a tempered and sober"
21550,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,tenderness.
21551,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21552,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson was miserable, and took no trouble to conceal his"
21553,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"wretchedness. He was in the Army--a Line regiment I think, but am not"
21554,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"certain--and, since his face was a looking-glass and his forehead an"
21555,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"open book, by reason of his innocence, his brothers in arms made his"
21556,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,life a burden to him and embittered his naturally sweet disposition. No
21557,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"one except ""Very Young"" Gayerson, and he never told his views, knew how"
21558,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"old ""Very Young"" Gayerson believed the Venus Annodomini to be. Perhaps"
21559,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"he thought her five and twenty, or perhaps she told him that she was"
21560,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"this age. ""Very Young"" Gayerson would have forded the Gugger in flood to"
21561,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"carry her lightest word, and had implicit faith in her. Every one liked"
21562,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"him, and every one was sorry when they saw him so bound a slave of the"
21563,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Venus Annodomini. Every one, too, admitted that it was not her fault;"
21564,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,for the Venus Annodomini differed from Mrs. Hauksbee and Mrs. Reiver in
21565,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"this particular--she never moved a finger to attract any one; but, like"
21566,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Ninon de l'Enclos, all men were attracted to her. One could admire and"
21567,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"respect Mrs. Hauksbee, despise and avoid Mrs. Reiver, but one was forced"
21568,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,to adore the Venus Annodomini.
21569,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21570,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson's papa held a Division or a Collectorate"
21571,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,or something administrative in a particularly unpleasant part of
21572,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Bengal--full of Babus who edited newspapers proving that ""Young"""
21573,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Gayerson was a ""Nero"" and a ""Scylla"" and a ""Charybdis""; and, in addition"
21574,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"to the Babus, there was a good deal of dysentery and cholera abroad"
21575,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"for nine months of the year. ""Young"" Gayerson--he was about five and"
21576,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"forty--rather liked Babus, they amused him, but he objects to dysentery,"
21577,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"and when he could get away, went to Darjiling for the most part. This"
21578,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"particular season he fancied that he would come up to Simla, and see his"
21579,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,boy. The boy was not altogether pleased. He told the Venus Annodomini
21580,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"that his father was coming up, and she flushed a little and said that"
21581,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,she should be delighted to make his acquaintance. Then she looked long
21582,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"and thoughtfully at ""Very Young"" Gayerson; because she was very, very"
21583,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"sorry for him, and he was a very, very big idiot."
21584,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21585,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""My daughter is coming out in a fortnight, Mr. Gayerson,"" she said."
21586,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,

21588,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21589,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Daughter,"" said the Venus Annodomini. ""She's been out for a year at"
21590,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Home already, and I want her to see a little of India. She is nineteen"

21592,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21593,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson, who was a short twenty-two years old, nearly fell"
21594,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"out of his chair with astonishment; for he had persisted in believing,"
21595,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"against all belief, in the youth of the Venus Annodomini."
21596,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21597,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"She, with her back to the curtained window, watched the effect of her"
21598,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,sentences and smiled.

21600,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson's papa came up twelve days later, and had not been"
21601,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"in Simla four and twenty hours, before two men, old acquaintances of"
21602,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"his, had told him how ""Very Young"" Gayerson had been conducting himself."
21603,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21604,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Young"" Gayerson laughed a good deal, and inquired who the Venus"
21605,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,Annodomini might be. Which proves that he had been living in Bengal
21606,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,where nobody knows anything except the rate of Exchange. Then he said
21607,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""boys will be boys,"" and spoke to his son about the matter."
21608,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21609,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson said that he felt wretched and unhappy; and"
21610,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Young"" Gayerson said that he repented of having helped to bring a fool"
21611,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,into the world. He suggested that his son had better cut his leave short
21612,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"and go down to his duties. This led to an unfilial answer, and relations"
21613,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"were strained, until ""Young"" Gayerson demanded that they should call on"
21614,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"the Venus Annodomini. ""Very Young"" Gayerson went with his papa, feeling,"
21615,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"somehow, uncomfortable and small."
21616,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21617,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"The Venus Annodomini received them graciously and ""Young"" Gayerson"
21618,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"said:--""By Jove! It's Kitty!"" ""Very Young"" Gayerson would have listened"
21619,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"for an explanation, if his time had not been taken up with trying to"
21620,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"talk to a large, handsome, quiet, well-dressed girl--introduced to him"
21621,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"by the Venus Annodomini as her daughter. She was far older in manners,"
21622,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"style and repose than ""Very Young"" Gayerson; and, as he realized this"
21623,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"thing, he felt sick."
21624,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21625,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"Presently, he heard the Venus Annodomini saying:--""Do you know that your"

21630,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"ever so long ago, Kitty--and you haven't changed since then. How strange"
21631,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"it all seems!"""
21632,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,
21633,VENUS ANNODOMINI.,"""Very Young"" Gayerson said nothing. His conversation with the daughter"

21664,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Some natives say that it came from the other side of Kulu, where"
21665,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,the eleven-inch Temple Sapphire is. Others that it was made at the
21666,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Devil-Shrine of Ao-Chung in Thibet, was stolen by a Kafir, from him by"
21667,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"a Gurkha, from him again by a Lahouli, from him by a khitmatgar, and by"
21668,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"this latter sold to an Englishman, so all its virtue was lost: because,"
21669,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"to work properly, the Bisara of Pooree must be stolen--with bloodshed if"
21670,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"possible, but, at any rate, stolen."
21671,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21672,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,These stories of the coming into India are all false. It was made at
21673,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Pooree ages since--the manner of its making would fill a small book--was
21674,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"stolen by one of the Temple dancing-girls there, for her own purposes,"
21675,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"and then passed on from hand to hand, steadily northward, till it"
21676,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,reached Hanla: always bearing the same name--the Bisara of Pooree. In
21677,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"shape it is a tiny, square box of silver, studded outside with eight"
21678,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"small balas-rubies. Inside the box, which opens with a spring, is"
21679,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"a little eyeless fish, carved from some sort of dark, shiny nut and"
21680,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"wrapped in a shred of faded gold-cloth. That is the Bisara of Pooree,"
21681,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,and it were better for a man to take a king cobra in his hand than to
21682,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,touch the Bisara of Pooree.

21684,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,All kinds of magic are out of date and done away with except in India
21685,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"where nothing changes in spite of the shiny, toy-scum stuff that people"
21686,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"call ""civilization."" Any man who knows about the Bisara of Pooree will"
21687,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,tell you what its powers are--always supposing that it has been honestly
21688,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"stolen. It is the only regularly working, trustworthy love-charm in the"

21691,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"[The other charm is in the hands of a trooper of the Nizam's Horse, at a"
21692,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"place called Tuprani, due north of Hyderabad.] This can be depended upon"
21693,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,for a fact. Some one else may explain it.
21694,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21695,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"If the Bisara be not stolen, but given or bought or found, it turns"
21696,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"against its owner in three years, and leads to ruin or death. This is"

21698,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21699,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Meanwhile, you can laugh at it. At present, the Bisara is safe on an"

21701,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Evil-eye. If the ekka-driver ever finds it, and wears it, or gives it to"
21702,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"his wife, I am sorry for him."
21703,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21704,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"A very dirty hill-cooly woman, with goitre, owned it at Theog in 1884."
21705,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"It came into Simla from the north before Churton's khitmatgar bought it,"
21706,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"and sold it, for three times its silver-value, to Churton, who collected"
21707,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,curiosities. The servant knew no more what he had bought than
21708,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,the master; but a man looking over Churton's collection of
21709,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,curiosities--Churton was an Assistant Commissioner by the way--saw and
21710,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,held his tongue. He was an Englishman; but knew how to believe. Which
21711,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,shows that he was different from most Englishmen. He knew that it was
21712,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,dangerous to have any share in the little box when working or dormant;
21713,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,for unsought Love is a terrible gift.

21715,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Pack--""Grubby"" Pack, as we used to call him--was, in every way, a nasty"
21716,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,little man who must have crawled into the Army by mistake. He was three
21717,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"inches taller than his sword, but not half so strong. And the sword was"
21718,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"a fifty-shilling, tailor-made one. Nobody liked him, and, I suppose, it"
21719,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,was his wizenedness and worthlessness that made him fall so hopelessly
21720,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"in love with Miss Hollis, who was good and sweet, and five foot seven in"
21721,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"her tennis shoes. He was not content with falling in love quietly,"
21722,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,but brought all the strength of his miserable little nature into the
21723,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"business. If he had not been so objectionable, one might have pitied"
21724,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"him. He vapored, and fretted, and fumed, and trotted up and down, and"
21725,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"tried to make himself pleasing in Miss Hollis's big, quiet, gray eyes,"
21726,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"and failed. It was one of the cases that you sometimes meet, even in"
21727,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"this country where we marry by Code, of a really blind attachment all on"
21728,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"one side, without the faintest possibility of return. Miss Hollis"
21729,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,looked on Pack as some sort of vermin running about the road. He had
21730,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"no prospects beyond Captain's pay, and no wits to help that out by one"
21731,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"anna. In a large-sized man, love like his would have been touching."
21732,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21733,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"In a good man it would have been grand. He being what he was, it was"
21734,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,only a nuisance.
21735,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21736,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"You will believe this much. What you will not believe, is what follows:"
21737,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Churton, and The Man who Knew that the Bisara was, were lunching at the"
21738,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Simla Club together. Churton was complaining of life in general. His
21739,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,best mare had rolled out of stable down the hill and had broken her
21740,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"back; his decisions were being reversed by the upper Courts, more"
21741,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,than an Assistant Commissioner of eight years' standing has a right to
21742,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"expect; he knew liver and fever, and, for weeks past, had felt out of"
21743,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"sorts. Altogether, he was disgusted and disheartened."
21744,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21745,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Simla Club dining-room is built, as all the world knows, in two"
21746,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"sections, with an arch-arrangement dividing them. Come in, turn to your"
21747,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"own left, take the table under the window, and you cannot see any one"
21748,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"who has come in, turning to the right, and taken a table on the right"
21749,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"side of the arch. Curiously enough, every word that you say can be"
21750,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"heard, not only by the other diner, but by the servants beyond the"
21751,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,screen through which they bring dinner. This is worth knowing: an
21752,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,echoing-room is a trap to be forewarned against.
21753,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21754,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Half in fun, and half hoping to be believed, The Man who Knew told"
21755,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Churton the story of the Bisara of Pooree at rather greater length than
21756,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,I have told it to you in this place; winding up with the suggestion that
21757,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Churton might as well throw the little box down the hill and see whether
21758,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"all his troubles would go with it. In ordinary ears, English ears, the"
21759,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"tale was only an interesting bit of folk-lore. Churton laughed,"
21760,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"said that he felt better for his tiffin, and went out. Pack had been"
21761,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"tiffining by himself to the right of the arch, and had heard everything."
21762,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,He was nearly mad with his absurd infatuation for Miss Hollis that all
21763,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Simla had been laughing about.
21764,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21765,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"It is a curious thing that, when a man hates or loves beyond reason, he"
21766,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,is ready to go beyond reason to gratify his feelings. Which he would not
21767,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"do for money or power merely. Depend upon it, Solomon would never have"
21768,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"built altars to Ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names, if"
21769,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"there had not been trouble of some kind in his zenana, and nowhere else."
21770,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,But this is beside the story. The facts of the case are these: Pack
21771,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"called on Churton next day when Churton was out, left his card, and"
21772,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,STOLE the Bisara of Pooree from its place under the clock on the
21773,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"mantelpiece! Stole it like the thief he was by nature. Three days later,"
21774,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,all Simla was electrified by the news that Miss Hollis had accepted
21775,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Pack--the shrivelled rat, Pack! Do you desire clearer evidence than"
21776,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"this? The Bisara of Pooree had been stolen, and it worked as it had"
21777,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,always done when won by foul means.
21778,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21779,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,There are three or four times in a man's life when he is justified in
21780,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,meddling with other people's affairs to play Providence.
21781,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21782,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,The Man who Knew felt that he WAS justified; but believing and acting on
21783,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,a belief are quite different things. The insolent satisfaction of Pack
21784,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"as he ambled by the side of Miss Hollis, and Churton's striking release"
21785,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"from liver, as soon as the Bisara of Pooree had gone, decided the Man."
21786,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"He explained to Churton and Churton laughed, because he was not brought"
21787,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,up to believe that men on the Government House List steal--at least
21788,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,little things. But the miraculous acceptance by Miss Hollis of that
21789,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"tailor, Pack, decided him to take steps on suspicion. He vowed that he"
21790,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,only wanted to find out where his ruby-studded silver box had vanished
21791,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,to. You cannot accuse a man on the Government House List of stealing.
21792,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"And if you rifle his room you are a thief yourself. Churton, prompted"
21793,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"by The Man who Knew, decided on burglary. If he found nothing in Pack's"
21794,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,room.... but it is not nice to think of what would have happened in
21795,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,that case.
21796,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21797,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Pack went to a dance at Benmore--Benmore WAS Benmore in those days, and"
21798,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,not an office--and danced fifteen waltzes out of twenty-two with Miss
21799,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Hollis. Churton and The Man took all the keys that they could lay hands
21800,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"on, and went to Pack's room in the hotel, certain that his servants"
21801,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,would be away. Pack was a cheap soul. He had not purchased a decent
21802,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"cash-box to keep his papers in, but one of those native imitations that"
21803,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"you buy for ten rupees. It opened to any sort of key, and there at the"
21804,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"bottom, under Pack's Insurance Policy, lay the Bisara of Pooree!"
21805,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21806,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Churton called Pack names, put the Bisara of Pooree in his pocket, and"
21807,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"went to the dance with The Man. At least, he came in time for supper,"
21808,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,and saw the beginning of the end in Miss Hollis's eyes. She was
21809,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"hysterical after supper, and was taken away by her Mamma."
21810,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21811,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"At the dance, with the abominable Bisara in his pocket, Churton twisted"
21812,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"his foot on one of the steps leading down to the old Rink, and had to be"
21813,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"sent home in a rickshaw, grumbling. He did not believe in the Bisara of"
21814,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Pooree any the more for this manifestation, but he sought out Pack and"
21815,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"called him some ugly names; and ""thief"" was the mildest of them. Pack"
21816,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,took the names with the nervous smile of a little man who wants both
21817,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"soul and body to resent an insult, and went his way. There was no public"
21818,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,scandal.
21819,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21820,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"A week later, Pack got his definite dismissal from Miss Hollis."
21821,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21822,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"There had been a mistake in the placing of her affections, she said."
21823,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21824,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"So he went away to Madras, where he can do no great harm even if he"
21825,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,lives to be a Colonel.
21826,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21827,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Churton insisted upon The Man who Knew taking the Bisara of Pooree as a
21828,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"gift. The Man took it, went down to the Cart Road at once, found an ekka"
21829,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"pony with a blue head-necklace, fastened the Bisara of Pooree inside the"
21830,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,necklace with a piece of shoe-string and thanked Heaven that he was
21831,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"rid of a danger. Remember, in case you ever find it, that you must not"
21832,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"destroy the Bisara of Pooree. I have not time to explain why just now,"
21833,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,but the power lies in the little wooden fish. Mister Gubernatis or Max
21834,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,Muller could tell you more about it than I.
21835,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21836,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,You will say that all this story is made up. Very well. If ever you come
21837,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"across a little silver, ruby-studded box, seven-eighths of an inch long"
21838,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"by three-quarters wide, with a dark-brown wooden fish, wrapped in gold"
21839,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"cloth, inside it, keep it. Keep it for three years, and then you will"
21840,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,discover for yourself whether my story is true or false.
21841,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21842,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,"Better still, steal it as Pack did, and you will be sorry that you had"
21843,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,not killed yourself in the beginning.
21844,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21845,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21846,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21847,THE BISARA OF POOREE.,
21848,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.
21849,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21850,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"""If I can attain Heaven for a pice, why should you be envious?"""
21851,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,--Opium Smoker's Proverb.
21852,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21853,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"This is no work of mine. My friend, Gabral Misquitta, the half-caste,"
21854,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"spoke it all, between moonset and morning, six weeks before he died; and"
21855,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,I took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so:--
21856,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21857,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,It lies between the Copper-smith's Gully and the pipe-stem sellers'
21858,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"quarter, within a hundred yards, too, as the crow flies, of the Mosque"
21859,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"of Wazir Khan. I don't mind telling any one this much, but I defy him"
21860,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"to find the Gate, however well he may think he knows the City. You might"
21861,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"even go through the very gully it stands in a hundred times, and be none"
21862,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"the wiser. We used to call the gully, ""the Gully of the Black Smoke,"""
21863,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,but its native name is altogether different of course. A loaded donkey
21864,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"couldn't pass between the walls; and, at one point, just before you"
21865,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"reach the Gate, a bulged house-front makes people go along all sideways."
21866,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21867,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,It isn't really a gate though. It's a house. Old Fung-Tching had it
21868,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,first five years ago. He was a boot-maker in Calcutta. They say that
21869,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,he murdered his wife there when he was drunk. That was why he dropped
21870,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"bazar-rum and took to the Black Smoke instead. Later on, he came up"
21871,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,north and opened the Gate as a house where you could get your smoke in
21872,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"peace and quiet. Mind you, it was a pukka, respectable opium-house, and"
21873,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"not one of those stifling, sweltering chandoo-khanas, that you can find"
21874,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"all over the City. No; the old man knew his business thoroughly, and he"
21875,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"was most clean for a Chinaman. He was a one-eyed little chap, not much"
21876,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"more than five feet high, and both his middle fingers were gone. All the"
21877,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"same, he was the handiest man at rolling black pills I have ever seen."
21878,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Never seemed to be touched by the Smoke, either; and what he took day"
21879,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"and night, night and day, was a caution. I've been at it five years, and"
21880,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,I can do my fair share of the Smoke with any one; but I was a child to
21881,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Fung-Tching that way. All the same, the old man was keen on his money,"
21882,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,very keen; and that's what I can't understand. I heard he saved a good
21883,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"deal before he died, but his nephew has got all that now; and the old"
21884,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,man's gone back to China to be buried.
21885,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21886,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"He kept the big upper room, where his best customers gathered, as neat"
21887,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,as a new pin. In one corner used to stand Fung-Tching's Joss--almost
21888,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,as ugly as Fung-Tching--and there were always sticks burning under his
21889,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,nose; but you never smelt 'em when the pipes were going thick. Opposite
21890,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,the Joss was Fung-Tching's coffin. He had spent a good deal of his
21891,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"savings on that, and whenever a new man came to the Gate he was always"
21892,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"introduced to it. It was lacquered black, with red and gold writings"
21893,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"on it, and I've heard that Fung-Tching brought it out all the way from"
21894,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"China. I don't know whether that's true or not, but I know that, if I"
21895,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"came first in the evening, I used to spread my mat just at the foot of"
21896,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"it. It was a quiet corner you see, and a sort of breeze from the gully"
21897,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"came in at the window now and then. Besides the mats, there was no other"
21898,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"furniture in the room--only the coffin, and the old Joss all green and"
21899,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,blue and purple with age and polish.
21900,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21901,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Fung-Tching never told us why he called the place ""The Gate of a Hundred"
21902,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Sorrows."" (He was the only Chinaman I know who used bad-sounding fancy"
21903,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,names. Most of them are flowery. As you'll see in Calcutta.) We used
21904,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"to find that out for ourselves. Nothing grows on you so much, if you're"
21905,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"white, as the Black Smoke. A yellow man is made different. Opium doesn't"
21906,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,tell on him scarcely at all; but white and black suffer a good deal. Of
21907,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"course, there are some people that the Smoke doesn't touch any more than"
21908,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"tobacco would at first. They just doze a bit, as one would fall asleep"
21909,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"naturally, and next morning they are almost fit for work. Now, I was"
21910,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"one of that sort when I began, but I've been at it for five years pretty"
21911,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"steadily, and its different now. There was an old aunt of mine, down"
21912,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Agra way, and she left me a little at her death. About sixty rupees a"
21913,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"month secured. Sixty isn't much. I can recollect a time, seems hundreds"
21914,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"and hundreds of years ago, that I was getting my three hundred a month,"
21915,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"and pickings, when I was working on a big timber contract in Calcutta."
21916,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21917,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,I didn't stick to that work for long. The Black Smoke does not allow of
21918,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"much other business; and even though I am very little affected by it, as"
21919,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"men go, I couldn't do a day's work now to save my life. After all, sixty"
21920,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,rupees is what I want. When old Fung-Tching was alive he used to draw
21921,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"the money for me, give me about half of it to live on (I eat very"
21922,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"little), and the rest he kept himself. I was free of the Gate at any"
21923,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"time of the day and night, and could smoke and sleep there when I liked,"
21924,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,so I didn't care. I know the old man made a good thing out of it; but
21925,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"that's no matter. Nothing matters, much to me; and, besides, the money"
21926,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,always came fresh and fresh each month.
21927,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21928,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"There was ten of us met at the Gate when the place was first opened. Me,"
21929,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"and two Baboos from a Government Office somewhere in Anarkulli, but they"
21930,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,got the sack and couldn't pay (no man who has to work in the daylight
21931,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,can do the Black Smoke for any length of time straight on); a Chinaman
21932,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,that was Fung-Tching's nephew; a bazar-woman that had got a lot of
21933,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"money somehow; an English loafer--Mac-Somebody I think, but I have"
21934,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"forgotten--that smoked heaps, but never seemed to pay anything (they"
21935,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,said he had saved Fung-Tching's life at some trial in Calcutta when
21936,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"he was a barrister): another Eurasian, like myself, from Madras; a"
21937,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"half-caste woman, and a couple of men who said they had come from the"
21938,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,North. I think they must have been Persians or Afghans or something.
21939,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"There are not more than five of us living now, but we come regular. I"
21940,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,don't know what happened to the Baboos; but the bazar-woman she died
21941,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"after six months of the Gate, and I think Fung-Tching took her bangles"
21942,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"and nose-ring for himself. But I'm not certain. The Englishman, he drank"
21943,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"as well as smoked, and he dropped off. One of the Persians got killed in"
21944,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"a row at night by the big well near the mosque a long time ago, and the"
21945,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Police shut up the well, because they said it was full of foul air."
21946,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21947,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"They found him dead at the bottom of it. So, you see, there is only me,"
21948,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"the Chinaman, the half-caste woman that we call the Memsahib (she used"
21949,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"to live with Fung-Tching), the other Eurasian, and one of the Persians."
21950,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,The Memsahib looks very old now. I think she was a young woman when the
21951,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,Gate was opened; but we are all old for the matter of that. Hundreds
21952,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,and hundreds of years old. It is very hard to keep count of time in the
21953,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Gate, and besides, time doesn't matter to me. I draw my sixty rupees"
21954,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,fresh and fresh every month.
21955,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21956,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"A very, very long while ago, when I used to be getting three hundred"
21957,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"and fifty rupees a month, and pickings, on a big timber-contract at"
21958,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Calcutta, I had a wife of sorts. But she's dead now. People said that I"
21959,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"killed her by taking to the Black Smoke. Perhaps I did, but it's so long"
21960,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"since it doesn't matter. Sometimes when I first came to the Gate, I used"
21961,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"to feel sorry for it; but that's all over and done with long ago, and"
21962,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month, and am quite happy."
21963,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Not DRUNK happy, you know, but always quiet and soothed and contented."
21964,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21965,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,How did I take to it? It began at Calcutta. I used to try it in my own
21966,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"house, just to see what it was like. I never went very far, but I think"
21967,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"my wife must have died then. Anyhow, I found myself here, and got to"
21968,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,know Fung-Tching. I don't remember rightly how that came about; but he
21969,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"told me of the Gate and I used to go there, and, somehow, I have never"
21970,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"got away from it since. Mind you, though, the Gate was a respectable"
21971,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"place in Fung-Tching's time where you could be comfortable, and not at"
21972,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,all like the chandoo-khanas where the niggers go. No; it was clean and
21973,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"quiet, and not crowded. Of course, there were others beside us ten"
21974,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,and the man; but we always had a mat apiece with a wadded woollen
21975,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"head-piece, all covered with black and red dragons and things; just like"
21976,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,a coffin in the corner.
21977,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21978,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,At the end of one's third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight.
21979,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"I've watched 'em, many and many a night through. I used to regulate"
21980,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"my Smoke that way, and now it takes a dozen pipes to make 'em stir."
21981,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Besides, they are all torn and dirty, like the mats, and old Fung-Tching"
21982,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"is dead. He died a couple of years ago, and gave me the pipe I always"
21983,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"use now--a silver one, with queer beasts crawling up and down the"
21984,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"receiver-bottle below the cup. Before that, I think, I used a big bamboo"
21985,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"stem with a copper cup, a very small one, and a green jade mouthpiece."
21986,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"It was a little thicker than a walking-stick stem, and smoked sweet,"
21987,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"very sweet. The bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke. Silver doesn't, and"
21988,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"I've got to clean it out now and then, that's a great deal of trouble,"
21989,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,but I smoke it for the old man's sake. He must have made a good thing
21990,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"out of me, but he always gave me clean mats and pillows, and the best"
21991,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,stuff you could get anywhere.
21992,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
21993,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"When he died, his nephew Tsin-ling took up the Gate, and he called it"
21994,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"the ""Temple of the Three Possessions;"" but we old ones speak of it"
21995,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"as the ""Hundred Sorrows,"" all the same. The nephew does things very"
21996,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"shabbily, and I think the Memsahib must help him. She lives with him;"
21997,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,same as she used to do with the old man. The two let in all sorts of low
21998,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"people, niggers and all, and the Black Smoke isn't as good as it used"
21999,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,to be. I've found burnt bran in my pipe over and over again. The old man
22000,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"would have died if that had happened in his time. Besides, the room"
22001,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"is never cleaned, and all the mats are torn and cut at the edges. The"
22002,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,coffin has gone--gone to China again--with the old man and two ounces of
22003,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"smoke inside it, in case he should want 'em on the way."
22004,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22005,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,The Joss doesn't get so many sticks burnt under his nose as he used to;
22006,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"that's a sign of ill-luck, as sure as Death. He's all brown, too, and"
22007,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"no one ever attends to him. That's the Memsahib's work, I know; because,"
22008,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"when Tsin-ling tried to burn gilt paper before him, she said it was a"
22009,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"waste of money, and, if he kept a stick burning very slowly, the Joss"
22010,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,wouldn't know the difference. So now we've got the sticks mixed with
22011,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"a lot of glue, and they take half-an-hour longer to burn, and smell"
22012,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,stinky. Let alone the smell of the room by itself. No business can get
22013,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,on if they try that sort of thing.
22014,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22015,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"The Joss doesn't like it. I can see that. Late at night, sometimes, he"
22016,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,turns all sorts of queer colors--blue and green and red--just as he used
22017,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,to do when old Fung-Tching was alive; and he rolls his eyes and stamps
22018,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,his feet like a devil.
22019,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22020,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,I don't know why I don't leave the place and smoke quietly in a little
22021,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"room of my own in the bazar. Most like, Tsin-ling would kill me if"
22022,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"I went away--he draws my sixty rupees now--and besides, it's so much"
22023,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"trouble, and I've grown to be very fond of the Gate. It's not much to"
22024,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"look at. Not what it was in the old man's time, but I couldn't leave it."
22025,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,I've seen so many come in and out. And I've seen so many die here on the
22026,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,mats that I should be afraid of dying in the open now. I've seen some
22027,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,things that people would call strange enough; but nothing is strange
22028,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"when you're on the Black Smoke, except the Black Smoke. And if it was,"
22029,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,it wouldn't matter.
22030,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22031,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Fung-Tching used to be very particular about his people, and never got"
22032,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,in any one who'd give trouble by dying messy and such. But the nephew
22033,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"isn't half so careful. He tells everywhere that he keeps a ""first-chop"""
22034,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"house. Never tries to get men in quietly, and make them comfortable like"
22035,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,Fung-Tching did. That's why the Gate is getting a little bit more known
22036,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,than it used to be. Among the niggers of course. The nephew daren't get
22037,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"a white, or, for matter of that, a mixed skin into the place. He has"
22038,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,to keep us three of course--me and the Memsahib and the other Eurasian.
22039,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,We're fixtures.
22040,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22041,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,But he wouldn't give us credit for a pipeful--not for anything.
22042,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22043,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"One of these days, I hope, I shall die in the Gate. The Persian and"
22044,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,the Madras man are terrible shaky now. They've got a boy to light their
22045,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"pipes for them. I always do that myself. Most like, I shall see them"
22046,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,carried out before me. I don't think I shall ever outlive the Memsahib
22047,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"or Tsin-ling. Women last longer than men at the Black-Smoke, and"
22048,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Tsin-ling has a deal of the old man's blood in him, though he DOES smoke"
22049,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,cheap stuff. The bazar-woman knew when she was going two days before her
22050,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"time; and SHE died on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow, and the"
22051,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"old man hung up her pipe just above the Joss. He was always fond of her,"
22052,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,I fancy. But he took her bangles just the same.
22053,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22054,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"I should like to die like the bazar-woman--on a clean, cool mat with a"
22055,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"pipe of good stuff between my lips. When I feel I'm going, I shall ask"
22056,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Tsin-ling for them, and he can draw my sixty rupees a month, fresh and"
22057,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"fresh, as long as he pleases, and watch the black and red dragons have"
22058,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,their last big fight together; and then....
22059,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,
22060,THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS.,"Well, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters much to me--only I wished"

22083,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22084,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting
22085,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,to play with polo-balls. He carried out the battered thing into the
22086,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"verandah; and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks, a patter of"
22087,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"small feet, and the thud-thud-thud of the ball rolling along the ground."
22088,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his

22091,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"Next day, coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual, I was"
22092,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"aware of a small figure in the dining-room--a tiny, plump figure in a"
22093,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"ridiculously inadequate shirt which came, perhaps, half-way down the"
22094,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"tubby stomach. It wandered round the room, thumb in mouth, crooning"

22097,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22098,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"He had no business in my room, of course; but was so deeply absorbed in"
22099,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway. I stepped into
22100,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,the room and startled him nearly into a fit. He sat down on the ground
22101,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"with a gasp. His eyes opened, and his mouth followed suit. I knew what"
22102,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"was coming, and fled, followed by a long, dry howl which reached the"
22103,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,servants' quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever
22104,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,done. In ten seconds Imam Din was in the dining-room. Then despairing
22105,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"sobs arose, and I returned to find Imam Din admonishing the small sinner"
22106,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief.
22107,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22108,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"""This boy,"" said Imam Din, judicially, ""is a budmash, a big budmash."

22113,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"""Tell the baby,"" said I, ""that the Sahib is not angry, and take him"

22115,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"now gathered all his shirt round his neck, string-wise, and the yell"
22116,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"subsided into a sob. The two set off for the door. ""His name,"" said Imam"
22117,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"Din, as though the name were part of the crime, ""is Muhammad Din, and he"
22118,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"is a budmash."" Freed from present danger, Muhammad Din turned round,"
22119,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"in his father's arms, and said gravely:--""It is true that my name is"

22121,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22122,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din. Never again did
22123,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"he come into my dining-room, but on the neutral ground of the compound,"
22124,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"we greeted each other with much state, though our conversation was"
22125,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"confined to ""Talaam, Tahib"" from his side and ""Salaam Muhammad Din"" from"
22126,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"mine. Daily on my return from office, the little white shirt, and the"
22127,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creeper-covered
22128,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"trellis where they had been hid; and daily I checked my horse here, that"
22129,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly.
22130,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22131,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,Muhammad Din never had any companions. He used to trot about the
22132,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"compound, in and out of the castor-oil bushes, on mysterious errands"
22133,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,of his own. One day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down
22134,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"the ground. He had half buried the polo-ball in dust, and stuck six"
22135,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it. Outside that
22136,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"circle again, was a rude square, traced out in bits of red brick"
22137,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,alternating with fragments of broken china; the whole bounded by a
22138,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,little bank of dust. The bhistie from the well-curb put in a plea for
22139,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"the small architect, saying that it was only the play of a baby and did"
22140,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,not much disfigure my garden.
22141,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22142,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the child's work then
22143,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"or later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought me"
22144,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"unawares full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew, marigold-heads,"
22145,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"dust-bank, and fragments of broken soap-dish into confusion past all"
22146,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,hope of mending. Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to
22147,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,himself over the ruin I had wrought.
22148,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22149,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for
22150,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"spoiling the garden, and had scattered his rubbish using bad language"
22151,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,the while. Muhammad Din labored for an hour at effacing every trace
22152,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"of the dust-bank and pottery fragments, and it was with a tearful"
22153,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"apologetic face that he said, ""Talaam Tahib,"" when I came home from the"
22154,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,office. A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that
22155,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,by my singular favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased.
22156,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,Whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the ground-plan of an
22157,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,edifice which was to eclipse the marigold-polo-ball creation.

22159,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"For some months, the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble"

22162,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"water-worn pebbles, bits of broken glass, and feathers pulled, I fancy,"
22163,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,from my fowls--always alone and always crooning to himself.

22165,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,A gayly-spotted sea-shell was dropped one day close to the last of his
22166,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,little buildings; and I looked that Muhammad Din should build something
22167,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it. Nor was I
22168,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"disappointed. He meditated for the better part of an hour, and his"
22169,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,crooning rose to a jubilant song. Then he began tracing in dust. It
22170,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"would certainly be a wondrous palace, this one, for it was two"
22171,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,yards long and a yard broad in ground-plan. But the palace was never
22172,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,completed.
22173,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,
22174,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriage-drive,"
22175,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"and no ""Talaam Tahib"" to welcome my return. I had grown accustomed to"
22176,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"the greeting, and its omission troubled me. Next day, Imam Din told me"
22177,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine. He
22178,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN.,"got the medicine, and an English Doctor."

22207,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"She had married and had many cares of her own. In the beginning, she"

22215,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22216,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,He kept his unrequited attachment by him as men keep a well-smoked

22223,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22224,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Then trouble came to him. All who go to Simla, know the slope from the"

22226,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"one September morning between calling hours, when a 'rickshaw came down"
22227,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"in a hurry, and in the 'rickshaw sat the living, breathing image of the"
22228,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,girl who had made him so happily unhappy.
22229,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22230,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Hannasyde leaned against the railing and gasped. He wanted to run
22231,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"downhill after the 'rickshaw, but that was impossible; so he went"
22232,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"forward with most of his blood in his temples. It was impossible, for"
22233,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"many reasons, that the woman in the 'rickshaw could be the girl he had"
22234,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"known. She was, he discovered later, the wife of a man from Dindigul, or"
22235,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Coimbatore, or some out-of-the-way place, and she had come up to Simla"
22236,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,early in the season for the good of her health.
22237,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22238,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"She was going back to Dindigul, or wherever it was, at the end of the"

22242,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,for one measured hour. What he decided upon was this; and you must

22248,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"the formula. All things considered, it would be pleasant to make the"
22249,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"acquaintance of Mrs. Landys-Haggert, and for a little time--only a very"
22250,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,little time--to make believe that he was with Alice Chisane again. Every
22251,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,one is more or less mad on one point. Hannasyde's particular monomania
22252,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"was his old love, Alice Chisane."
22253,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22254,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"He made it his business to get introduced to Mrs. Haggert, and the"
22255,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,introduction prospered. He also made it his business to see as much as
22256,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"he could of that lady. When a man is in earnest as to interviews, the"
22257,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"facilities which Simla offers are startling. There are garden-parties,"
22258,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"and tennis-parties, and picnics, and luncheons at Annandale, and"
22259,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"rifle-matches, and dinners and balls; besides rides and walks, which are"
22260,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,matters of private arrangement.
22261,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22262,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Hannasyde had started with the intention of seeing a likeness, and"
22263,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"he ended by doing much more. He wanted to be deceived, he meant to be"
22264,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"deceived, and he deceived himself very thoroughly. Not only were the"
22265,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"face and figure, the face and figure of Alice Chisane, but the voice and"
22266,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"lower tones were exactly the same, and so were the turns of speech; and"
22267,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"the little mannerisms, that every woman has, of gait and gesticulation,"
22268,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,were absolutely and identically the same. The turn of the head was the
22269,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,same; the tired look in the eyes at the end of a long walk was the same;
22270,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,the sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the
22271,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"same; and once, most marvellous of all, Mrs. Landys-Haggert singing to"
22272,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"herself in the next room, while Hannasyde was waiting to take her for a"
22273,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"ride, hummed, note for note, with a throaty quiver of the voice in the"
22274,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"second line:--""Poor Wandering One!"" exactly as Alice Chisane had hummed"
22275,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,it for Hannasyde in the dusk of an English drawing-room. In the actual
22276,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,woman herself--in the soul of her--there was not the least likeness; she
22277,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,and Alice Chisane being cast in different moulds. But all that
22278,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Hannasyde wanted to know and see and think about, was this maddening and"
22279,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,perplexing likeness of face and voice and manner. He was bent on making
22280,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,a fool of himself that way; and he was in no sort disappointed.
22281,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22282,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to
22283,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"any sort of woman; but Mrs. Landys-Haggert, being a woman of the world,"
22284,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,could make nothing of Hannasyde's admiration.
22285,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22286,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,He would take any amount of trouble--he was a selfish man habitually--to
22287,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"meet and forestall, if possible, her wishes."
22288,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22289,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Anything she told him to do was law; and he was, there could be no"
22290,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"doubting it, fond of her company so long as she talked to him, and kept"
22291,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,on talking about trivialities. But when she launched into expression of
22292,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"her personal views and her wrongs, those small social differences"
22293,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"that make the spice of Simla life, Hannasyde was neither pleased nor"
22294,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"interested. He didn't want to know anything about Mrs. Landys-Haggert,"
22295,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,or her experiences in the past--she had travelled nearly all over the
22296,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"world, and could talk cleverly--he wanted the likeness of Alice Chisane"
22297,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,before his eyes and her voice in his ears.
22298,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22299,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Anything outside that, reminding him of another personality jarred, and"
22300,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,he showed that it did.
22301,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22302,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Under the new Post Office, one evening, Mrs. Landys-Haggert turned on"
22303,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"him, and spoke her mind shortly and without warning. ""Mr. Hannasyde,"""
22304,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"said she, ""will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed"
22305,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,yourself my special cavalier servente? I don't understand it. But I
22306,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"am perfectly certain, somehow or other, that you don't care the least"
22307,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"little bit in the world for ME."" This seems to support, by the way, the"
22308,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found
22309,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,out. Hannasyde was taken off his guard. His defence never was a strong
22310,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"one, because he was always thinking of himself, and he blurted out,"
22311,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"before he knew what he was saying, this inexpedient answer:--""No more I"
22312,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"do."""
22313,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22314,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"The queerness of the situation and the reply, made Mrs. Haggert laugh."
22315,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Then it all came out; and at the end of Hannasyde's lucid explanation,"
22316,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Mrs. Haggert said, with the least little touch of scorn in her"
22317,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"voice:--""So I'm to act as the lay-figure for you to hang the rags of"
22318,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"your tattered affections on, am I?"""
22319,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22320,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Hannasyde didn't see what answer was required, and he devoted himself"
22321,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"generally and vaguely to the praise of Alice Chisane, which was"
22322,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,unsatisfactory. Now it is to be thoroughly made clear that Mrs. Haggert
22323,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in Hannasyde.
22324,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22325,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Only--only no woman likes being made love through instead of
22326,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,to--specially on behalf of a musty divinity of four years' standing.
22327,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22328,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition
22329,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,of himself. He was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of
22330,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Simla.
22331,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22332,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"When the season ended, Hannasyde went down to his own place and Mrs."
22333,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Haggert to hers. ""It was like making love to a ghost,"" said Hannasyde"
22334,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"to himself, ""and it doesn't matter; and now I'll get to my work."" But"
22335,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,he found himself thinking steadily of the Haggert-Chisane ghost; and he
22336,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,could not be certain whether it was Haggert or Chisane that made up the
22337,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,greater part of the pretty phantom..........
22338,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22339,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,He got understanding a month later.
22340,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22341,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,A peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a
22342,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,heartless Government transfers men from one end of the Empire to the
22343,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,other. You can never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till
22344,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,he or she dies. There was a case once--but that's another story.
22345,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22346,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Haggert's Department ordered him up from Dindigul to the Frontier at
22347,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"two days' notice, and he went through, losing money at every step, from"
22348,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Dindigul to his station. He dropped Mrs. Haggert at Lucknow, to stay"
22349,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"with some friends there, to take part in a big ball at the Chutter"
22350,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Munzil, and to come on when he had made the new home a little"
22351,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"comfortable. Lucknow was Hannasyde's station, and Mrs. Haggert stayed"
22352,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"a week there. Hannasyde went to meet her. And the train came in,"
22353,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,he discovered which he had been thinking of for the past month. The
22354,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"unwisdom of his conduct also struck him. The Lucknow week, with two"
22355,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"dances, and an unlimited quantity of rides together, clinched matters;"
22356,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,and Hannasyde found himself pacing this circle of thought:--He
22357,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,adored Alice Chisane--at least he HAD adored her. AND he admired
22358,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,Mrs. Landys-Haggert because she was like Alice Chisane. BUT Mrs.
22359,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Landys-Haggert was not in the least like Alice Chisane, being a thousand"
22360,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"times more adorable. NOW Alice Chisane was ""the bride of another,"" and"
22361,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"so was Mrs. Landys-Haggert, and a good and honest wife too. THEREFORE,"
22362,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"he, Hannasyde, was.... here he called himself several hard names,"
22363,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,and wished that he had been wise in the beginning.
22364,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22365,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Whether Mrs. Landys-Haggert saw what was going on in his mind, she alone"
22366,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,knows. He seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected
22367,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"with herself, as distinguished from the Alice-Chisane likeness, and he"
22368,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"said one or two things which, if Alice Chisane had been still betrothed"
22369,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"to him, could scarcely have been excused, even on the grounds of the"
22370,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"likeness. But Mrs. Haggert turned the remarks aside, and spent a long"
22371,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,time in making Hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been
22372,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,to him because of her strange resemblance to his old love. Hannasyde
22373,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"groaned in his saddle and said, ""Yes, indeed,"" and busied himself with"
22374,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"preparations for her departure to the Frontier, feeling very small and"
22375,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,miserable.
22376,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22377,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"The last day of her stay at Lucknow came, and Hannasyde saw her off"
22378,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,at the Railway Station. She was very grateful for his kindness and the
22379,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"trouble he had taken, and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one"
22380,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,who knew the Alice-Chisane reason of that kindness. And Hannasyde abused
22381,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"the coolies with the luggage, and hustled the people on the platform,"
22382,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,and prayed that the roof might fall in and slay him.
22383,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22384,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"As the train went out slowly, Mrs. Landys-Haggert leaned out of the"
22385,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"window to say goodbye:--""On second thoughts au revoir, Mr. Hannasyde. I"
22386,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"go Home in the Spring, and perhaps I may meet you in Town."""
22387,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22388,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"Hannasyde shook hands, and said very earnestly and adoringly:--""I hope"
22389,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,"to Heaven I shall never see your face again!"""
22390,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,
22391,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,And Mrs. Haggert understood.
22392,ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS.,

22397,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22398,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"I closed and drew for my love's sake,"
22399,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"That now is false to me,"
22400,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"And I slew the Riever of Tarrant Moss,"
22401,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,And set Dumeny free.

22406,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,And not for the men at the Moss.
22407,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,--Tarrant Moss.
22408,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22409,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,One of the many curses of our life out here is the want of atmosphere in
22410,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,the painter's sense. There are no half-tints worth noticing. Men stand
22411,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"out all crude and raw, with nothing to tone them down, and nothing to"
22412,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"scale them against. They do their work, and grow to think that there is"
22413,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"nothing but their work, and nothing like their work, and that they are"
22414,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,the real pivots on which the administration turns. Here is an instance
22415,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,of this feeling. A half-caste clerk was ruling forms in a Pay Office. He
22416,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"said to me:--""Do you know what would happen if I added or took away one"
22417,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"single line on this sheet?"" Then, with the air of a conspirator:--""It"
22418,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,would disorganize the whole of the Treasury payments throughout the
22419,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"whole of the Presidency Circle! Think of that?"""
22420,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22421,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,If men had not this delusion as to the ultra-importance of their own
22422,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"particular employments, I suppose that they would sit down and kill"
22423,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"themselves. But their weakness is wearisome, particularly when the"
22424,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin.
22425,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22426,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,Even the Secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an
22427,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,over-driven Executive Officer to take census of wheat-weevils through a
22428,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,district of five thousand square miles.
22429,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22430,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,There was a man once in the Foreign Office--a man who had grown
22431,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"middle-aged in the department, and was commonly said, by irreverent"
22432,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"juniors, to be able to repeat Aitchison's ""Treaties and Sunnuds"""
22433,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"backwards, in his sleep. What he did with his stored knowledge only the"
22434,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Secretary knew; and he, naturally, would not publish the news abroad."
22435,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"This man's name was Wressley, and it was the Shibboleth, in those days,"
22436,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"to say:--""Wressley knows more about the Central Indian States than any"
22437,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"living man."" If you did not say this, you were considered one of mean"
22438,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,understanding.
22439,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22440,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Now-a-days, the man who says that he knows the ravel of the inter-tribal"
22441,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"complications across the Border is of more use; but in Wressley's time,"
22442,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,much attention was paid to the Central Indian States. They were called
22443,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"""foci"" and ""factors,"" and all manner of imposing names."
22444,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22445,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,And here the curse of Anglo-Indian life fell heavily. When Wressley
22446,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"lifted up his voice, and spoke about such-and-such a succession to"
22447,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"such-and-such a throne, the Foreign Office were silent, and Heads"
22448,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,of Departments repeated the last two or three words of Wressley's
22449,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"sentences, and tacked ""yes, yes,"" on them, and knew that they were"

22451,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"In most big undertakings, one or two men do the work while the rest sit"

22453,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22454,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Wressley was the working-member of the Foreign Office firm, and, to keep"
22455,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging, he was made much"
22456,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,of by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was.
22457,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22458,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"He did not require coaxing, because he was of tough build, but what"
22459,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,he received confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite
22460,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,so absolutely and imperatively necessary to the stability of India as
22461,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Wressley of the Foreign Office. There might be other good men, but the"
22462,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"known, honored and trusted man among men was Wressley of the Foreign"
22463,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Office. We had a Viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to ""gentle"""
22464,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"a fractious big man and to hearten up a collar-galled little one, and so"
22465,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,keep all his team level. He conveyed to Wressley the impression which I
22466,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,have just set down; and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a
22467,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,Viceroy's praise. There was a case once--but that is another story.
22468,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22469,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,All India knew Wressley's name and office--it was in Thacker and Spink's
22470,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Directory--but who he was personally, or what he did, or what his"
22471,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"special merits were, not fifty men knew or cared. His work filled all"
22472,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"his time, and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond"
22473,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,those of dead Rajput chiefs with Ahir blots in their 'scutcheons.
22474,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,Wressley would have made a very good Clerk in the Herald's College had

22477,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Upon a day, between office and office, great trouble came to"
22478,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Wressley--overwhelmed him, knocked him down, and left him gasping"
22479,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"as though he had been a little school-boy. Without reason, against"
22480,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"prudence, and at a moment's notice, he fell in love with a frivolous,"
22481,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"golden-haired girl who used to tear about Simla Mall on a high, rough"
22482,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"waler, with a blue velvet jockey-cap crammed over her eyes. Her name was"

22485,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"She took Wressley's heart at a hand-gallop, and Wressley found that it"

22494,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,for she lisped very prettily. She did not understand one little thing

22518,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,would wait a year for that. Her mamma would help her to wait.
22519,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22520,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"So Wressley took one year's leave and all the available documents, about"
22521,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"a truck-load, that he could lay hands on, and went down to Central India"
22522,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,with his notion hot in his head. He began his book in the land he was
22523,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,writing of. Too much official correspondence had made him a frigid
22524,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"workman, and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of"
22525,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,local color on his palette. This is a dangerous paint for amateurs to
22526,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,play with.
22527,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22528,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Heavens, how that man worked! He caught his Rajahs, analyzed his Rajahs,"
22529,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"and traced them up into the mists of Time and beyond, with their"
22530,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"queens and their concubines. He dated and cross-dated, pedigreed and"
22531,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"triple-pedigreed, compared, noted, connoted, wove, strung, sorted,"
22532,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"selected, inferred, calendared and counter-calendared for ten hours a"
22533,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"day. And, because this sudden and new light of Love was upon him, he"
22534,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,turned those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into
22535,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,things to weep or to laugh over as he pleased. His heart and soul were
22536,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"at the end of his pen, and they got into the ink. He was dowered with"
22537,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"sympathy, insight, humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and"
22538,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,nights; and his book was a Book. He had his vast special knowledge with
22539,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"him, so to speak; but the spirit, the woven-in human Touch, the poetry"
22540,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"and the power of the output, were beyond all special knowledge. But I"
22541,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"doubt whether he knew the gift that was in him then, and thus he may"
22542,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"have lost some happiness. He was toiling for Tillie Venner, not for"
22543,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,himself.
22544,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22545,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Men often do their best work blind, for some one else's sake."
22546,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22547,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Also, though this has nothing to do with the story, in India where every"
22548,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"one knows every one else, you can watch men being driven, by the women"
22549,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"who govern them, out of the rank-and-file and sent to take up points"
22550,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"alone. A good man once started, goes forward; but an average man, so"
22551,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,soon as the woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her
22552,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"power, comes back to the battalion and is no more heard of."
22553,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22554,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Wressley bore the first copy of his book to Simla and, blushing and"
22555,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"stammering, presented it to Miss Venner. She read a little of it."
22556,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22557,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"I give her review verbatim:--""Oh, your book? It's all about those"
22558,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"how-wid Wajahs. I didn't understand it.""........."
22559,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22560,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Wressley of the Foreign Office was broken, smashed,--I am not"
22561,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,exaggerating--by this one frivolous little girl. All that he could say
22562,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"feebly was:--""But, but it's my magnum opus! The work of my life."" Miss"
22563,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,Venner did not know what magnum opus meant; but she knew that Captain
22564,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,Kerrington had won three races at the last Gymkhana. Wressley didn't
22565,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,press her to wait for him any longer. He had sense enough for that.
22566,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22567,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Then came the reaction after the year's strain, and Wressley went back"
22568,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"to the Foreign Office and his ""Wajahs,"" a compiling, gazetteering,"
22569,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"report-writing hack, who would have been dear at three hundred rupees"
22570,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,a month. He abided by Miss Venner's review. Which proves that the
22571,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with
22572,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"himself. Nevertheless, he had no right to sink, in a hill-tarn, five"
22573,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"packing-cases, brought up at enormous expense from Bombay, of the best"
22574,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,book of Indian history ever written.
22575,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22576,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"When he sold off before retiring, some years later, I was turning over"
22577,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"his shelves, and came across the only existing copy of ""Native Rule in"
22578,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Central India""--the copy that Miss Venner could not understand. I read"
22579,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"it, sitting on his mule-trucks, as long as the light lasted, and offered"
22580,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,him his own price for it. He looked over my shoulder for a few pages and
22581,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"said to himself drearily:--""Now, how in the world did I come to write"
22582,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"such damned good stuff as that?"" Then to me:--""Take it and keep"
22583,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,it. Write one of your penny-farthing yarns about its birth.
22584,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,Perhaps--perhaps--the whole business may have been ordained to that
22585,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"end."""
22586,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,
22587,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,"Which, knowing what Wressley of the Foreign Office was once, struck me"
22588,WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.,as about the bitterest thing that I had ever heard a man say of his own

22604,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"This tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made, and"
22605,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,where the bounds of the Possible are put down. I have lived long enough
22606,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"in this country to know that it is best to know nothing, and can only"
22607,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,write the story as it happened.
22608,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22609,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Dumoise was our Civil Surgeon at Meridki, and we called him ""Dormouse,"""
22610,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"because he was a round little, sleepy little man. He was a good"
22611,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Doctor and never quarrelled with any one, not even with our Deputy"
22612,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Commissioner, who had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse."
22613,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,He married a girl as round and as sleepy-looking as himself. She was
22614,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"a Miss Hillardyce, daughter of ""Squash"" Hillardyce of the Berars, who"
22615,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,married his Chief's daughter by mistake. But that is another story.
22616,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22617,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,A honeymoon in India is seldom more than a week long; but there is
22618,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,nothing to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years.
22619,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,This is a delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one
22620,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,another. They can live absolutely alone and without interruption--just
22621,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,as the Dormice did. These two little people retired from the world after
22622,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"their marriage, and were very happy. They were forced, of course,"
22623,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"to give occasional dinners, but they made no friends hereby, and the"
22624,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Station went its own way and forgot them; only saying, occasionally,"
22625,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"that Dormouse was the best of good fellows, though dull. A Civil Surgeon"
22626,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"who never quarrels is a rarity, appreciated as such."
22627,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22628,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Few people can afford to play Robinson Crusoe anywhere--least of all
22629,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"in India, where we are few in the land, and very much dependent on each"
22630,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,other's kind offices. Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the
22631,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"world for a year, and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of"
22632,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"typhoid broke out in the Station in the heart of the cold weather, and"
22633,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"his wife went down. He was a shy little man, and five days were wasted"
22634,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,before he realized that Mrs. Dumoise was burning with something worse
22635,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"than simple fever, and three days more passed before he ventured to call"
22636,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"on Mrs. Shute, the Engineer's wife, and timidly speak about his trouble."
22637,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Nearly every household in India knows that Doctors are very helpless
22638,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"in typhoid. The battle must be fought out between Death and the Nurses,"
22639,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,minute by minute and degree by degree. Mrs. Shute almost boxed Dumoise's
22640,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"ears for what she called his ""criminal delay,"" and went off at once to"
22641,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,look after the poor girl. We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station
22642,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"that winter and, as the average of death is about one in every five"
22643,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"cases, we felt certain that we should have to lose somebody. But all did"
22644,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"their best. The women sat up nursing the women, and the men turned"
22645,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"to and tended the bachelors who were down, and we wrestled with those"
22646,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"typhoid cases for fifty-six days, and brought them through the Valley of"
22647,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"the Shadow in triumph. But, just when we thought all was over, and were"
22648,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"going to give a dance to celebrate the victory, little Mrs. Dumoise"
22649,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,got a relapse and died in a week and the Station went to the funeral.
22650,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave, and had to be"
22651,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,taken away.
22652,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22653,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"After the death, Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be"
22654,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"comforted. He did his duties perfectly, but we all felt that he should"
22655,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"go on leave, and the other men of his own Service told him so. Dumoise"
22656,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,was very thankful for the suggestion--he was thankful for anything in
22657,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,those days--and went to Chini on a walking-tour.
22658,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22659,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Chini is some twenty marches from Simla, in the heart of the Hills, and"
22660,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"the scenery is good if you are in trouble. You pass through big,"
22661,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"still deodar-forests, and under big, still cliffs, and over big, still"
22662,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,grass-downs swelling like a woman's breasts; and the wind across the
22663,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"grass, and the rain among the deodars says:--""Hush--hush--hush."" So"
22664,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"little Dumoise was packed off to Chini, to wear down his grief with a"
22665,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"full-plate camera, and a rifle. He took also a useless bearer, because"
22666,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"the man had been his wife's favorite servant. He was idle and a thief,"
22667,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,but Dumoise trusted everything to him.
22668,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22669,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"On his way back from Chini, Dumoise turned aside to Bagi, through the"
22670,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Forest Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo. Some men who have
22671,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,travelled more than a little say that the march from Kotegarh to Bagi is
22672,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"one of the finest in creation. It runs through dark wet forest, and ends"
22673,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"suddenly in bleak, nipped hill-side and black rocks. Bagi dak-bungalow"
22674,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,is open to all the winds and is bitterly cold. Few people go to Bagi.
22675,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Perhaps that was the reason why Dumoise went there. He halted at seven
22676,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"in the evening, and his bearer went down the hill-side to the village"
22677,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"to engage coolies for the next day's march. The sun had set, and the"
22678,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,night-winds were beginning to croon among the rocks. Dumoise leaned on
22679,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"the railing of the verandah, waiting for his bearer to return. The man"
22680,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"came back almost immediately after he had disappeared, and at such a"
22681,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,rate that Dumoise fancied he must have crossed a bear. He was running as
22682,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,hard as he could up the face of the hill.
22683,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22684,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,But there was no bear to account for his terror. He raced to the
22685,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"verandah and fell down, the blood spurting from his nose and his face"
22686,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"iron-gray. Then he gurgled:--""I have seen the Memsahib! I have seen the"
22687,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Memsahib!"""
22688,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22689,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"""Where?"" said Dumoise."
22690,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22691,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"""Down there, walking on the road to the village. She was in a blue"
22692,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"dress, and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and said:--'Ram Dass, give"
22693,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"my salaams to the Sahib, and tell him that I shall meet him next month"
22694,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"at Nuddea.' Then I ran away, because I was afraid."""
22695,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22696,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,What Dumoise said or did I do not know. Ram Dass declares that he said
22697,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"nothing, but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night, waiting"
22698,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,for the Memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into
22699,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"the dark like a madman. But no Memsahib came, and, next day, he went on"
22700,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,to Simla cross-questioning the bearer every hour.
22701,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22702,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Ram Dass could only say that he had met Mrs. Dumoise and that she had
22703,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully
22704,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,repeated to Dumoise. To this statement Ram Dass adhered.
22705,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22706,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"He did not know where Nuddea was, had no friends at Nuddea, and would"
22707,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,most certainly never go to Nuddea; even though his pay were doubled.
22708,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22709,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Nuddea is in Bengal, and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor"
22710,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,serving in the Punjab. It must be more than twelve hundred miles from
22711,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Meridki.
22712,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22713,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Dumoise went through Simla without halting, and returned to Meridki"
22714,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,there to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him
22715,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"during his tour. There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained,"
22716,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"and some recent orders of the Surgeon-General to be noted, and,"
22717,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"altogether, the taking-over was a full day's work. In the evening,"
22718,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Dumoise told his locum tenens, who was an old friend of his bachelor"
22719,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"days, what had happened at Bagi; and the man said that Ram Dass might as"
22720,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,well have chosen Tuticorin while he was about it.
22721,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22722,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"At that moment a telegraph-peon came in with a telegram from Simla,"
22723,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"ordering Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki, but to go at once"
22724,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,to Nuddea on special duty. There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at
22725,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Nuddea, and the Bengal Government, being shorthanded, as usual, had"
22726,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,borrowed a Surgeon from the Punjab.
22727,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22728,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and said:--""Well?"""
22729,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22730,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,The other Doctor said nothing. It was all that he could say.
22731,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22732,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way
22733,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"from Bagi; and thus might, possibly, have heard the first news of the"
22734,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,impending transfer.
22735,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22736,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"He tried to put the question, and the implied suspicion into words, but"
22737,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Dumoise stopped him with:--""If I had desired THAT, I should never have"
22738,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"come back from Chini. I was shooting there. I wish to live, for I have"
22739,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"things to do.... but I shall not be sorry."""
22740,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22741,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"The other man bowed his head, and helped, in the twilight, to pack up"
22742,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Dumoise's just opened trunks. Ram Dass entered with the lamps.
22743,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22744,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"""Where is the Sahib going?"" he asked."
22745,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22746,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"""To Nuddea,"" said Dumoise, softly."
22747,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22748,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Ram Dass clawed Dumoise's knees and boots and begged him not to go.
22749,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22750,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,Ram Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room. Then he
22751,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character.
22752,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"He was not going to Nuddea to see his Sahib die, and, perhaps to die"
22753,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,himself.
22754,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22755,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,So Dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to Nuddea alone; the
22756,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,other Doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death.
22757,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,
22758,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,"Eleven days later, he had joined his Memsahib; and the Bengal Government"
22759,BY WORD OF MOUTH.,had to borrow a fresh Doctor to cope with that epidemic at Nuddea. The

22810,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""I live there,"" said he, ""and I should be extremely obliged if you would"
22811,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,be good enough to help my mutinous feet thither; for I am more than
22812,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,usually drunk--most--most phenomenally tight. But not in respect to my
22813,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,head. 'My brain cries out against'--how does it go? But my head rides on
22814,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"the--rolls on the dung-hill I should have said, and controls the qualm."""
22815,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22816,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,I helped him through the gangs of tethered horses and he collapsed on
22817,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,the edge of the verandah in front of the line of native quarters.
22818,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22819,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""Thanks--a thousand thanks! O Moon and little, little Stars! To think"
22820,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"that a man should so shamelessly.... Infamous liquor, too. Ovid in"
22821,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,exile drank no worse. Better. It was frozen. Alas! I had no ice. Good
22822,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"night. I would introduce you to my wife were I sober--or she civilized."""
22823,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22824,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"A native woman came out of the darkness of the room, and began calling"
22825,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,the man names; so I went away. He was the most interesting loafer that
22826,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"I had the pleasure of knowing for a long time; and later on, he became"
22827,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"a friend of mine. He was a tall, well-built, fair man fearfully shaken"
22828,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"with drink, and he looked nearer fifty than the thirty-five which, he"
22829,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"said, was his real age. When a man begins to sink in India, and is not"
22830,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"sent Home by his friends as soon as may be, he falls very low from a"
22831,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"respectable point of view. By the time that he changes his creed, as did"
22832,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"McIntosh, he is past redemption."
22833,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22834,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"In most big cities, natives will tell you of two or three Sahibs,"
22835,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"generally low-caste, who have turned Hindu or Mussulman, and who live"
22836,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,more or less as such. But it is not often that you can get to know
22837,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"them. As McIntosh himself used to say:--""If I change my religion for my"
22838,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"stomach's sake, I do not seek to become a martyr to missionaries, nor am"
22839,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"I anxious for notoriety."""
22840,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22841,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"At the outset of acquaintance McIntosh warned me. ""Remember this. I am"
22842,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"not an object for charity. I require neither your money, your food,"
22843,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"nor your cast-off raiment. I am that rare animal, a self-supporting"
22844,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"drunkard. If you choose, I will smoke with you, for the tobacco of the"
22845,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"bazars does not, I admit, suit my palate; and I will borrow any books"
22846,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,which you may not specially value. It is more than likely that I shall
22847,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"sell them for bottles of excessively filthy country-liquors. In return,"
22848,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,you shall share such hospitality as my house affords. Here is a charpoy
22849,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"on which two can sit, and it is possible that there may, from time to"
22850,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"time, be food in that platter. Drink, unfortunately, you will find on"
22851,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,the premises at any hour: and thus I make you welcome to all my poor
22852,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"establishments."""
22853,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22854,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,I was admitted to the McIntosh household--I and my good tobacco.
22855,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22856,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"But nothing else. Unluckily, one cannot visit a loafer in the Serai by"
22857,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,day. Friends buying horses would not understand it.
22858,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22859,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Consequently, I was obliged to see McIntosh after dark. He laughed"
22860,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"at this, and said simply:--""You are perfectly right. When I enjoyed"
22861,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"a position in society, rather higher than yours, I should have done"
22862,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"exactly the same thing, Good Heavens! I was once""--he spoke as though"
22863,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"he had fallen from the Command of a Regiment--""an Oxford Man!"" This"
22864,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,accounted for the reference to Charley Symonds' stable.
22865,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22866,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""You,"" said McIntosh, slowly, ""have not had that advantage; but, to"
22867,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"outward appearance, you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong"
22868,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"drinks. On the whole, I fancy that you are the luckier of the two. Yet"
22869,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,I am not certain. You are--forgive my saying so even while I am smoking
22870,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"your excellent tobacco--painfully ignorant of many things."""
22871,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22872,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"We were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead, for he owned"
22873,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"no chairs, watching the horses being watered for the night, while the"
22874,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,native woman was preparing dinner. I did not like being patronized by a
22875,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"loafer, but I was his guest for the time being, though he owned only one"
22876,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,very torn alpaca-coat and a pair of trousers made out of gunny-bags.
22877,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"He took the pipe out of his mouth, and went on judicially:--""All things"
22878,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"considered, I doubt whether you are the luckier. I do not refer to"
22879,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"your extremely limited classical attainments, or your excruciating"
22880,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"quantities, but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately"
22881,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"under your notice. That for instance.""--He pointed to a woman cleaning"
22882,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,a samovar near the well in the centre of the Serai. She was flicking the
22883,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks.
22884,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22885,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""There are ways and ways of cleaning samovars. If you knew why she"
22886,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"was doing her work in that particular fashion, you would know what the"
22887,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Spanish Monk meant when he said--
22888,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22889,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"'I the Trinity illustrate,"
22890,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Drinking watered orange-pulp--
22891,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"In three sips the Aryan frustrate,"
22892,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,While he drains his at one gulp.--'
22893,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22894,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes. However, Mrs."
22895,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,McIntosh has prepared dinner. Let us come and eat after the fashion of
22896,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"the people of the country--of whom, by the way, you know nothing."""
22897,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22898,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,The native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us. This was wrong.
22899,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,The wife should always wait until the husband has eaten.
22900,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22901,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"McIntosh Jellaludin apologized, saying:--"
22902,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22903,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""It is an English prejudice which I have not been able to overcome; and"
22904,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"she loves me. Why, I have never been able to understand. I fore-gathered"
22905,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"with her at Jullundur, three years ago, and she has remained with me"
22906,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"ever since. I believe her to be moral, and know her to be skilled in"
22907,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"cookery."""
22908,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22909,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"He patted the woman's head as he spoke, and she cooed softly. She was"
22910,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,not pretty to look at.
22911,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22912,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,McIntosh never told me what position he had held before his fall.
22913,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22914,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"He was, when sober, a scholar and a gentleman. When drunk, he was rather"
22915,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,more of the first than the second. He used to get drunk about once a
22916,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,week for two days. On those occasions the native woman tended him
22917,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"while he raved in all tongues except his own. One day, indeed, he began"
22918,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"reciting Atalanta in Calydon, and went through it to the end, beating"
22919,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,time to the swing of the verse with a bedstead-leg. But he did most of
22920,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,his ravings in Greek or German. The man's mind was a perfect rag-bag
22921,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"of useless things. Once, when he was beginning to get sober, he told"
22922,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,me that I was the only rational being in the Inferno into which he had
22923,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"descended--a Virgil in the Shades, he said--and that, in return for"
22924,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"my tobacco, he would, before he died, give me the materials of a new"
22925,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Inferno that should make me greater than Dante. Then he fell asleep on a
22926,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,horse-blanket and woke up quite calm.
22927,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22928,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""Man,"" said he, ""when you have reached the uttermost depths of"
22929,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"degradation, little incidents which would vex a higher life, are to you"
22930,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"of no consequence. Last night, my soul was among the gods; but I make no"
22931,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"doubt that my bestial body was writhing down here in the garbage."""
22932,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22933,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""You were abominably drunk if that's what you mean,"" I said."
22934,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22935,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""I WAS drunk--filthy drunk. I who am the son of a man with whom you have"
22936,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,no concern--I who was once Fellow of a College whose buttery-hatch you
22937,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,have not seen. I was loathsomely drunk. But consider how lightly I am
22938,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,touched. It is nothing to me. Less than nothing; for I do not even feel
22939,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"the headache which should be my portion. Now, in a higher life, how"
22940,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"ghastly would have been my punishment, how bitter my repentance! Believe"
22941,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"me, my friend with the neglected education, the highest is as the"
22942,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"lowest--always supposing each degree extreme."""
22943,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22944,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"He turned round on the blanket, put his head between his fists and"

22946,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22947,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""On the Soul which I have lost and on the Conscience which I have"
22948,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"killed, I tell you that I CANNOT feel! I am as the gods, knowing good"
22949,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"and evil, but untouched by either. Is this enviable or is it not?"""
22950,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22951,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"When a man has lost the warning of ""next morning's head,"" he must be in"
22952,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"a bad state, I answered, looking at McIntosh on the blanket, with his"
22953,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"hair over his eyes and his lips blue-white, that I did not think the"
22954,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,insensibility good enough.
22955,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22956,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""For pity's sake, don't say that! I tell you, it IS good and most"
22957,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"enviable. Think of my consolations!"""
22958,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22959,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""Have you so many, then, McIntosh?"""
22960,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22961,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""Certainly; your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon"
22962,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"of a cultured man, are crude. First, my attainments, my classical and"
22963,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"literary knowledge, blurred, perhaps, by immoderate drinking--which"
22964,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"reminds me that before my soul went to the Gods last night, I sold the"
22965,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Pickering Horace you so kindly lent me. Ditta Mull the Clothesman has
22966,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"it. It fetched ten annas, and may be redeemed for a rupee--but still"
22967,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"infinitely superior to yours. Secondly, the abiding affection of Mrs."
22968,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"McIntosh, best of wives. Thirdly, a monument, more enduring than brass,"
22969,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"which I have built up in the seven years of my degradation."""
22970,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22971,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"He stopped here, and crawled across the room for a drink of water."
22972,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22973,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,He was very shaky and sick.
22974,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22975,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"He referred several times to his ""treasure""--some great possession that"
22976,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,he owned--but I held this to be the raving of drink. He was as poor and
22977,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"as proud as he could be. His manner was not pleasant, but he knew enough"
22978,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"about the natives, among whom seven years of his life had been spent,"
22979,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,to make his acquaintance worth having. He used actually to laugh at
22980,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Strickland as an ignorant man--""ignorant West and East""--he said. His"
22981,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"boast was, first, that he was an Oxford Man of rare and shining parts,"
22982,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,which may or may not have been true--I did not know enough to check his
22983,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"statements--and, secondly, that he ""had his hand on the pulse of native"
22984,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"life""--which was a fact. As an Oxford man, he struck me as a prig: he"
22985,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,was always throwing his education about. As a Mahommedan faquir--as
22986,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,McIntosh Jellaludin--he was all that I wanted for my own ends. He smoked
22987,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"several pounds of my tobacco, and taught me several ounces of things"
22988,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"worth knowing; but he would never accept any gifts, not even when the"
22989,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"cold weather came, and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin"
22990,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"alpaca-coat. He grew very angry, and said that I had insulted him, and"
22991,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,that he was not going into hospital. He had lived like a beast and he
22992,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"would die rationally, like a man."
22993,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22994,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"As a matter of fact, he died of pneumonia; and on the night of his death"
22995,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,sent over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die.
22996,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
22997,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"The native woman was weeping by the side of the bed. McIntosh, wrapped"
22998,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"in a cotton cloth, was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over"
22999,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"him. He was very active as far as his mind was concerned, and his eyes"
23000,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,were blazing. When he had abused the Doctor who came with me so foully
23001,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"that the indignant old fellow left, he cursed me for a few minutes and"
23002,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,calmed down.
23003,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23004,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Then he told his wife to fetch out ""The Book"" from a hole in the wall."
23005,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"She brought out a big bundle, wrapped in the tail of a petticoat, of old"
23006,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"sheets of miscellaneous note-paper, all numbered and covered with fine"
23007,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,cramped writing. McIntosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and
23008,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,stirred it up lovingly.
23009,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23010,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""This,"" he said, ""is my work--the Book of McIntosh Jellaludin, showing"
23011,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"what he saw and how he lived, and what befell him and others; being also"
23012,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,an account of the life and sins and death of Mother Maturin. What Mirza
23013,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Murad Ali Beg's book is to all other books on native life, will my work"
23014,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"be to Mirza Murad Ali Beg's!"""
23015,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23016,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"This, as will be conceded by any one who knows Mirza Ali Beg's book, was"
23017,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,a sweeping statement. The papers did not look specially valuable; but
23018,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,McIntosh handled them as if they were currency-notes.
23019,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23020,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Then he said slowly:--""In despite the many weaknesses of your education,"
23021,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,you have been good to me. I will speak of your tobacco when I reach the
23022,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Gods. I owe you much thanks for many kindnesses.
23023,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23024,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""But I abominate indebtedness. For this reason I bequeath to you now the"
23025,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,monument more enduring than brass--my one book--rude and imperfect in
23026,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"parts, but oh, how rare in others! I wonder if you will understand it."
23027,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,It is a gift more honorable than... Bah! where is my brain rambling
23028,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,to? You will mutilate it horribly. You will knock out the gems you call
23029,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"'Latin quotations,' you Philistine, and you will butcher the style to"
23030,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,carve into your own jerky jargon; but you cannot destroy the whole of

23032,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23033,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""Ethel... My brain again!.. Mrs. McIntosh, bear witness that I give"
23034,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"the sahib all these papers. They would be of no use to you, Heart of my"
23035,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"heart; and I lay it upon you,"" he turned to me here, ""that you do not"
23036,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,let my book die in its present form. It is yours unconditionally--the
23037,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"story of McIntosh Jellaludin, which is NOT the story of McIntosh"
23038,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Jellaludin, but of a greater man than he, and of a far greater woman."
23039,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Listen now! I am neither mad nor drunk! That book will make you famous."""
23040,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23041,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"I said, ""thank you,"" as the native woman put the bundle into my arms."
23042,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23043,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""My only baby!"" said McIntosh with a smile. He was sinking fast, but"
23044,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,he continued to talk as long as breath remained. I waited for the
23045,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"end: knowing that, in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his"
23046,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,mother. He turned on his side and said:--
23047,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23048,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"""Say how it came into your possession. No one will believe you, but my"
23049,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"name, at least, will live. You will treat it brutally, I know you will."
23050,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Some of it must go; the public are fools and prudish fools. I was their
23051,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,servant once. But do your mangling gently--very gently. It is a great
23052,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"work, and I have paid for it in seven years' damnation."""
23053,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23054,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"His voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths, and then he began mumbling"
23055,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,a prayer of some kind in Greek. The native woman cried very bitterly.
23056,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Lastly, he rose in bed and said, as loudly as slowly:--""Not guilty, my"
23057,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Lord!"""
23058,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23059,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Then he fell back, and the stupor held him till he died. The native"
23060,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,woman ran into the Serai among the horses and screamed and beat her
23061,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,breasts; for she had loved him.
23062,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23063,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,Perhaps his last sentence in life told what McIntosh had once gone
23064,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"through; but, saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth, there"
23065,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,was nothing in his room to say who or what he had been.
23066,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23067,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,The papers were in a hopeless muddle.
23068,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23069,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"Strickland helped me to sort them, and he said that the writer was"
23070,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,either an extreme liar or a most wonderful person. He thought the
23071,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"former. One of these days, you may be able to judge for yourself."
23072,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,
23073,TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE.,"The bundle needed much expurgation and was full of Greek nonsense, at"

23114,CHAPTER I,"cartridges go off of their own accord?"""
23115,CHAPTER I,
23116,CHAPTER I,"""Don't know. Take the revolver, if you are afraid, and let me carry"
23117,CHAPTER I,"them."""
23118,CHAPTER I,
23119,CHAPTER I,"""I'm not afraid."" Maisie strode forward swiftly, a hand in her pocket"
23120,CHAPTER I,and her chin in the air. Dick followed with a small pin-fire revolver.
23121,CHAPTER I,
23122,CHAPTER I,The children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable
23123,CHAPTER I,"without pistol-practice. After much forethought and self-denial, Dick"
23124,CHAPTER I,"had saved seven shillings and sixpence, the price of a badly constructed"
23125,CHAPTER I,Belgian revolver. Maisie could only contribute half a crown to the
23126,CHAPTER I,"syndicate for the purchase of a hundred cartridges. ""You can save better"
23127,CHAPTER I,"than I can, Dick,"" she explained; ""I like nice things to eat, and it"
23128,CHAPTER I,"doesn't matter to you. Besides, boys ought to do these things."""
23129,CHAPTER I,
23130,CHAPTER I,"Dick grumbled a little at the arrangement, but went out and made the"
23131,CHAPTER I,"purchase, which the children were then on their way to test. Revolvers"
23132,CHAPTER I,did not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the
23133,CHAPTER I,guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother
23134,CHAPTER I,"to these two orphans. Dick had been under her care for six years, during"
23135,CHAPTER I,which time she had made her profit of the allowances supposed to be
23136,CHAPTER I,"expended on his clothes, and, partly through thoughtlessness, partly"
23137,CHAPTER I,"through a natural desire to pain,--she was a widow of some years anxious"
23138,CHAPTER I,"to marry again,--had made his days burdensome on his young shoulders."
23139,CHAPTER I,
23140,CHAPTER I,"Where he had looked for love, she gave him first aversion and then hate."
23141,CHAPTER I,
23142,CHAPTER I,"Where he growing older had sought a little sympathy, she gave him"
23143,CHAPTER I,ridicule. The many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her
23144,CHAPTER I,small house she devoted to what she called the home-training of Dick
23145,CHAPTER I,"Heldar. Her religion, manufactured in the main by her own intelligence"
23146,CHAPTER I,"and a keen study of the Scriptures, was an aid to her in this matter. At"
23147,CHAPTER I,"such times as she herself was not personally displeased with Dick, she"
23148,CHAPTER I,left him to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with his
23149,CHAPTER I,Creator; wherefore Dick learned to loathe his God as intensely as he
23150,CHAPTER I,loathed Mrs. Jennett; and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the
23151,CHAPTER I,"young. Since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar, when dread of"
23152,CHAPTER I,"pain drove him to his first untruth he naturally developed into a liar,"
23153,CHAPTER I,"but an economical and self-contained one, never throwing away the least"
23154,CHAPTER I,"unnecessary fib, and never hesitating at the blackest, were it only"
23155,CHAPTER I,"plausible, that might make his life a little easier. The treatment"
23156,CHAPTER I,"taught him at least the power of living alone,--a power that was of"
23157,CHAPTER I,service to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at
23158,CHAPTER I,"his clothes, which were poor in quality and much mended. In the holidays"
23159,CHAPTER I,"he returned to the teachings of Mrs. Jennett, and, that the chain of"
23160,CHAPTER I,"discipline might not be weakened by association with the world, was"
23161,CHAPTER I,"generally beaten, on one account or another, before he had been twelve"
23162,CHAPTER I,hours under her roof.
23163,CHAPTER I,
23164,CHAPTER I,"The autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage, a"
23165,CHAPTER I,"long-haired, gray-eyed little atom, as self-contained as himself, who"
23166,CHAPTER I,moved about the house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only
23167,CHAPTER I,to the goat that was her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the
23168,CHAPTER I,back-garden. Mrs. Jennett objected to the goat on the grounds that
23169,CHAPTER I,"he was un-Christian,--which he certainly was. ""Then,"" said the"
23170,CHAPTER I,"atom, choosing her words very deliberately, ""I shall write to my"
23171,CHAPTER I,lawyer-peoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman. Amomma
23172,CHAPTER I,"is mine, mine, mine!"" Mrs. Jennett made a movement to the hall, where"
23173,CHAPTER I,certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack. The atom understood as
23174,CHAPTER I,"clearly as Dick what this meant. ""I have been beaten before,"" she said,"
23175,CHAPTER I,"still in the same passionless voice; ""I have been beaten worse than you"
23176,CHAPTER I,can ever beat me. If you beat me I shall write to my lawyer-peoples
23177,CHAPTER I,and tell them that you do not give me enough to eat. I am not afraid of
23178,CHAPTER I,"you."" Mrs. Jennett did not go into the hall, and the atom, after a pause"
23179,CHAPTER I,"to assure herself that all danger of war was past, went out, to weep"
23180,CHAPTER I,bitterly on Amomma's neck.
23181,CHAPTER I,
23182,CHAPTER I,"Dick learned to know her as Maisie, and at first mistrusted her"
23183,CHAPTER I,"profoundly, for he feared that she might interfere with the small"
23184,CHAPTER I,"liberty of action left to him. She did not, however; and she volunteered"
23185,CHAPTER I,no friendliness until Dick had taken the first steps. Long before the
23186,CHAPTER I,"holidays were over, the stress of punishment shared in common drove the"
23187,CHAPTER I,"children together, if it were only to play into each other's hands as"
23188,CHAPTER I,"they prepared lies for Mrs. Jennett's use. When Dick returned to school,"
23189,CHAPTER I,"Maisie whispered, ""Now I shall be all alone to take care of myself;"
23190,CHAPTER I,"but,"" and she nodded her head bravely, ""I can do it. You promised to"
23191,CHAPTER I,"send Amomma a grass collar. Send it soon."" A week later she asked for"
23192,CHAPTER I,"that collar by return of post, and was not pleased when she learned that"
23193,CHAPTER I,"it took time to make. When at last Dick forwarded the gift, she forgot"
23194,CHAPTER I,to thank him for it.
23195,CHAPTER I,
23196,CHAPTER I,"Many holidays had come and gone since that day, and Dick had grown into"
23197,CHAPTER I,a lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes. Not
23198,CHAPTER I,"for a moment had Mrs. Jennett relaxed her tender care of him, but the"
23199,CHAPTER I,average canings of a public school--Dick fell under punishment about
23200,CHAPTER I,"three times a month--filled him with contempt for her powers. ""She"
23201,CHAPTER I,"doesn't hurt,"" he explained to Maisie, who urged him to rebellion, ""and"
23202,CHAPTER I,"she is kinder to you after she has whacked me."" Dick shambled through"
23203,CHAPTER I,"the days unkempt in body and savage in soul, as the smaller boys of the"
23204,CHAPTER I,"school learned to know, for when the spirit moved him he would hit them,"
23205,CHAPTER I,cunningly and with science. The same spirit made him more than once try
23206,CHAPTER I,"to tease Maisie, but the girl refused to be made unhappy. ""We are both"
23207,CHAPTER I,"miserable as it is,"" said she. ""What is the use of trying to make things"
23208,CHAPTER I,"worse? Let's find things to do, and forget things."""
23209,CHAPTER I,
23210,CHAPTER I,The pistol was the outcome of that search. It could only be used on the
23211,CHAPTER I,"muddiest foreshore of the beach, far away from the bathing-machines and"
23212,CHAPTER I,"pierheads, below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling. The tide ran out"
23213,CHAPTER I,"nearly two miles on that coast, and the many-coloured mud-banks, touched"
23214,CHAPTER I,"by the sun, sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed. It was late in the"
23215,CHAPTER I,"afternoon when Dick and Maisie arrived on their ground, Amomma trotting"
23216,CHAPTER I,patiently behind them.
23217,CHAPTER I,
23218,CHAPTER I,"""Mf!"" said Maisie, sniffing the air. ""I wonder what makes the sea so"
23219,CHAPTER I,"smelly? I don'tlike it!"""
23220,CHAPTER I,
23221,CHAPTER I,"""You never like anything that isn't made just for you,"" said Dick"
23222,CHAPTER I,"bluntly. ""Give me the cartridges, and I'll try first shot. How far does"
23223,CHAPTER I,"one of these little revolvers carry?"""
23224,CHAPTER I,
23225,CHAPTER I,"""Oh, half a mile,"" said Maisie, promptly. ""At least it makes an awful"
23226,CHAPTER I,noise. Be careful with the cartridges; I don't like those jagged
23227,CHAPTER I,"stick-up things on the rim. Dick, do be careful."""
23228,CHAPTER I,
23229,CHAPTER I,"""All right. I know how to load. I'll fire at the breakwater out there."""
23230,CHAPTER I,
23231,CHAPTER I,"He fired, and Amomma ran away bleating. The bullet threw up a spurt of"
23232,CHAPTER I,mud to the right of the wood-wreathed piles.
23233,CHAPTER I,
23234,CHAPTER I,"""Throws high and to the right. You try, Maisie. Mind, it's loaded all"
23235,CHAPTER I,"round."""
23236,CHAPTER I,
23237,CHAPTER I,"Maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud,"
23238,CHAPTER I,"her hand firmly closed on the butt, her mouth and left eye screwed up."
23239,CHAPTER I,
23240,CHAPTER I,Dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed. Amomma returned very
23241,CHAPTER I,cautiously. He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon
23242,CHAPTER I,"walks, and, finding the cartridge-box unguarded, made investigations"
23243,CHAPTER I,"with his nose. Maisie fired, but could not see where the bullet went."
23244,CHAPTER I,
23245,CHAPTER I,"""I think it hit the post,"" she said, shading her eyes and looking out"
23246,CHAPTER I,across the sailless sea.
23247,CHAPTER I,
23248,CHAPTER I,"""I know it has gone out to the Marazion Bell-buoy,"" said Dick, with a"
23249,CHAPTER I,"chuckle. ""Fire low and to the left; then perhaps you'll get it. Oh, look"
23250,CHAPTER I,"at Amomma!--he's eating the cartridges!"""
23251,CHAPTER I,
23252,CHAPTER I,"Maisie turned, the revolver in her hand, just in time to see Amomma"
23253,CHAPTER I,scampering away from the pebbles Dick threw after him. Nothing is sacred
23254,CHAPTER I,"to a billy-goat. Being well fed and the adored of his mistress, Amomma"
23255,CHAPTER I,had naturally swallowed two loaded pin-fire cartridges. Maisie hurried
23256,CHAPTER I,up to assure herself that Dick had not miscounted the tale.
23257,CHAPTER I,
23258,CHAPTER I,"""Yes, he's eaten two."""
23259,CHAPTER I,
23260,CHAPTER I,"""Horrid little beast! Then they'll joggle about inside him and blow up,"
23261,CHAPTER I,"and serve him right.... Oh, Dick! have I killed you?"""
23262,CHAPTER I,
23263,CHAPTER I,Revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with. Maisie could
23264,CHAPTER I,"not explain how it had happened, but a veil of reeking smoke separated"
23265,CHAPTER I,"her from Dick, and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in"
23266,CHAPTER I,"his face. Then she heard him sputter, and dropped on her knees beside"
23267,CHAPTER I,"him, crying, ""Dick, you aren't hurt, are you? I didn't mean it."""
23268,CHAPTER I,
23269,CHAPTER I,"""Of course you didn't,"" said Dick, coming out of the smoke and wiping his"
23270,CHAPTER I,"cheek. ""But you nearly blinded me. That powder stuff stings awfully."""
23271,CHAPTER I,A neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had
23272,CHAPTER I,gone. Maisie began to whimper.
23273,CHAPTER I,
23274,CHAPTER I,"""Don't,"" said Dick, jumping to his feet and shaking himself. ""I'm not a"
23275,CHAPTER I,"bit hurt."""
23276,CHAPTER I,
23277,CHAPTER I,"""No, but I might have killed you,"" protested Maisie, the corners of her"
23278,CHAPTER I,"mouth drooping. ""What should I have done then?"""
23279,CHAPTER I,
23280,CHAPTER I,"""Gone home and told Mrs. Jennett."" Dick grinned at the thought; then,"
23281,CHAPTER I,"softening, ""Please don't worry about it. Besides, we are wasting time."
23282,CHAPTER I,"We've got to get back to tea. I'll take the revolver for a bit."""
23283,CHAPTER I,
23284,CHAPTER I,"Maisie would have wept on the least encouragement, but Dick's"
23285,CHAPTER I,"indifference, albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol,"
23286,CHAPTER I,restrained her. She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically
23287,CHAPTER I,"bombarded the breakwater. ""Got it at last!"" he exclaimed, as a lock of"
23288,CHAPTER I,weed flew from the wood.
23289,CHAPTER I,
23290,CHAPTER I,"""Let me try,"" said Maisie, imperiously. ""I'm all right now."""
23291,CHAPTER I,
23292,CHAPTER I,They fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself
23293,CHAPTER I,"to pieces, and Amomma the outcast--because he might blow up at any"
23294,CHAPTER I,moment--browsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown
23295,CHAPTER I,at him. Then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which
23296,CHAPTER I,"was commanded by the seaward slope of Fort Keeling, and they sat down"
23297,CHAPTER I,together before this new target.
23298,CHAPTER I,
23299,CHAPTER I,"""Next holidays,"" said Dick, as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked"
23300,CHAPTER I,"wildly in his hand, ""we'll get another pistol,--central fire,--that will"
23301,CHAPTER I,"carry farther."""
23302,CHAPTER I,
23303,CHAPTER I,"""There won't be any next holidays for me,"" said Maisie. ""I'm going away."""
23304,CHAPTER I,
23305,CHAPTER I,"""Where to?"""
23306,CHAPTER I,
23307,CHAPTER I,"""I don't know. My lawyers have written to Mrs. Jennett, and I've got to"
23308,CHAPTER I,"be educated somewhere,--in France, perhaps,--I don'tknow where; but I"
23309,CHAPTER I,"shall be glad to go away."""
23310,CHAPTER I,
23311,CHAPTER I,"""I shan't like it a bit. I suppose I shall be left. Look here, Maisie,"
23312,CHAPTER I,is it really true you're going? Then these holidays will be the last I
23313,CHAPTER I,"shall see anything of you; and I go back to school next week. I wish----"""
23314,CHAPTER I,
23315,CHAPTER I,The young blood turned his cheeks scarlet. Maisie was picking
23316,CHAPTER I,grass-tufts and throwing them down the slope at a yellow sea-poppy
23317,CHAPTER I,nodding all by itself to the illimitable levels of the mud-flats and the
23318,CHAPTER I,milk-white sea beyond.
23319,CHAPTER I,
23320,CHAPTER I,"""I wish,"" she said, after a pause, ""that I could see you again sometime."
23321,CHAPTER I,"You wish that, too?"""
23322,CHAPTER I,
23323,CHAPTER I,"""Yes, but it would have been better if--if--you had--shot straight over"
23324,CHAPTER I,"there--down by the breakwater."""
23325,CHAPTER I,
23326,CHAPTER I,Maisie looked with large eyes for a moment. And this was the boy
23327,CHAPTER I,who only ten days before had decorated Amomma's horns with cut-paper
23328,CHAPTER I,"ham-frills and turned him out, a bearded derision, among the public"
23329,CHAPTER I,ways! Then she dropped her eyes: this was not the boy.
23330,CHAPTER I,
23331,CHAPTER I,"""Don't be stupid,"" she said reprovingly, and with swift instinct"
23332,CHAPTER I,"attacked the side-issue. ""How selfish you are! Just think what I should"
23333,CHAPTER I,have felt if that horrid thing had killed you! I'm quite miserable
23334,CHAPTER I,"enough already."""
23335,CHAPTER I,
23336,CHAPTER I,"""Why? Because you're going away from Mrs. Jennett?"""
23337,CHAPTER I,
23338,CHAPTER I,"""No."""
23339,CHAPTER I,
23340,CHAPTER I,"""From me, then?"""
23341,CHAPTER I,
23342,CHAPTER I,"No answer for a long time. Dick dared not look at her. He felt, though"
23343,CHAPTER I,"he did not know, all that the past four years had been to him, and this"
23344,CHAPTER I,the more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words.
23345,CHAPTER I,
23346,CHAPTER I,"""I don't know,"" she said. ""I suppose it is."""
23347,CHAPTER I,
23348,CHAPTER I,"""Maisie, you must know. I'm not supposing."""
23349,CHAPTER I,
23350,CHAPTER I,"""Let's go home,"" said Maisie, weakly."
23351,CHAPTER I,
23352,CHAPTER I,But Dick was not minded to retreat.
23353,CHAPTER I,
23354,CHAPTER I,"""I can't say things,"" he pleaded, ""and I'm awfully sorry for teasing you"
23355,CHAPTER I,"about Amomma the other day. It's all different now, Maisie, can't you"
23356,CHAPTER I,"see? And you might have told me that you were going, instead of leaving"
23357,CHAPTER I,"me to find out."""
23358,CHAPTER I,
23359,CHAPTER I,"""You didn't. I did tell. Oh, Dick, what's the use of worrying?"""
23360,CHAPTER I,
23361,CHAPTER I,"""There isn't any; but we've been together years and years, and I didn't"
23362,CHAPTER I,"know how much I cared."""
23363,CHAPTER I,
23364,CHAPTER I,"""I don't believe you ever did care."""
23365,CHAPTER I,
23366,CHAPTER I,"""No, I didn't; but I do,--I care awfully now, Maisie,"" he gulped,--""Maisie,"

23368,CHAPTER I,
23369,CHAPTER I,"""I do, indeed I do; but it won't be any use."""
23370,CHAPTER I,
23371,CHAPTER I,"""Why?"""
23372,CHAPTER I,
23373,CHAPTER I,"""Because I am going away."""
23374,CHAPTER I,
23375,CHAPTER I,"""Yes, but if you promise before you go. Only say--will you?"" A second"
23376,CHAPTER I,"""darling"" came to his lips more easily than the first. There were"
23377,CHAPTER I,few endearments in Dick's home or school life; he had to find them by
23378,CHAPTER I,instinct. Dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of
23379,CHAPTER I,the revolver.
23380,CHAPTER I,
23381,CHAPTER I,"""I promise,"" she said solemnly; ""but if I care there is no need for"
23382,CHAPTER I,"promising."""
23383,CHAPTER I,
23384,CHAPTER I,"""And do you care?"" For the first time in the past few minutes their eyes"
23385,CHAPTER I,met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech....
23386,CHAPTER I,
23387,CHAPTER I,"""Oh, Dick, don't! Please don't! It was all right when we said"
23388,CHAPTER I,"good-morning; but now it's all different!"" Amomma looked on from afar."
23389,CHAPTER I,
23390,CHAPTER I,"He had seen his property quarrel frequently, but he had never seen"
23391,CHAPTER I,"kisses exchanged before. The yellow sea-poppy was wiser, and nodded its"
23392,CHAPTER I,"head approvingly. Considered as a kiss, that was a failure, but since it"
23393,CHAPTER I,"was the first, other than those demanded by duty, in all the world that"
23394,CHAPTER I,"either had ever given or taken, it opened to them new worlds, and every"
23395,CHAPTER I,"one of them glorious, so that they were lifted above the consideration"
23396,CHAPTER I,"of any worlds at all, especially those in which tea is necessary, and"
23397,CHAPTER I,"sat still, holding each other's hands and saying not a word."
23398,CHAPTER I,
23399,CHAPTER I,"""You can't forget now,"" said Dick, at last. There was that on his cheek"
23400,CHAPTER I,that stung more than gunpowder.
23401,CHAPTER I,
23402,CHAPTER I,"""I shouldn't have forgotten anyhow,"" said Maisie, and they looked at"
23403,CHAPTER I,each other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour
23404,CHAPTER I,ago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand. The sun began
23405,CHAPTER I,"to set, and a night-wind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore."
23406,CHAPTER I,
23407,CHAPTER I,"""We shall be awfully late for tea,"" said Maisie. ""Let's go home."""
23408,CHAPTER I,
23409,CHAPTER I,"""Let's use the rest of the cartridges first,"" said Dick; and he helped"
23410,CHAPTER I,"Maisie down the slope of the fort to the sea,--a descent that she was"
23411,CHAPTER I,quite capable of covering at full speed. Equally gravely Maisie took the
23412,CHAPTER I,"grimy hand. Dick bent forward clumsily; Maisie drew the hand away, and"
23413,CHAPTER I,Dick blushed.
23414,CHAPTER I,
23415,CHAPTER I,"""It's very pretty,"" he said."
23416,CHAPTER I,
23417,CHAPTER I,"""Pooh!"" said Maisie, with a little laugh of gratified vanity. She stood"
23418,CHAPTER I,close to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired
23419,CHAPTER I,over the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was
23420,CHAPTER I,protecting Maisie from all the evils in the world. A puddle far across
23421,CHAPTER I,the mud caught the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red
23422,CHAPTER I,"disc. The light held Dick's attention for a moment, and as he raised his"
23423,CHAPTER I,"revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous, in"
23424,CHAPTER I,that he was standing by Maisie who had promised to care for him for an
23425,CHAPTER I,indefinite length of time till such date as----A gust of the growing
23426,CHAPTER I,wind drove the girl's long black hair across his face as she stood with
23427,CHAPTER I,"her hand on his shoulder calling Amomma ""a little beast,"" and for a"
23428,CHAPTER I,"moment he was in the dark,--a darkness that stung. The bullet went"
23429,CHAPTER I,singing out to the empty sea.
23430,CHAPTER I,
23431,CHAPTER I,"""Spoilt my aim,"" said he, shaking his head. ""There aren't any more"
23432,CHAPTER I,"cartridges; we shall have to run home."" But they did not run. They"
23433,CHAPTER I,"walked very slowly, arm in arm. And it was a matter of indifference to"
23434,CHAPTER I,them whether the neglected Amomma with two pin-fire cartridges in his
23435,CHAPTER I,inside blew up or trotted beside them; for they had come into a golden
23436,CHAPTER I,heritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their
23437,CHAPTER I,years.
23438,CHAPTER I,
23439,CHAPTER I,"""And I shall be----"" quoth Dick, valiantly. Then he checked himself: ""I"
23440,CHAPTER I,"don't know what I shall be. I don't seem to be able to pass any exams,"
23441,CHAPTER I,"but I can make awful caricatures of the masters. Ho! Ho!"""
23442,CHAPTER I,
23443,CHAPTER I,"""Be an artist, then,"" said Maisie. ""You're always laughing at my trying"
23444,CHAPTER I,"to draw; and it will do you good."""
23445,CHAPTER I,
23446,CHAPTER I,"""I'll never laugh at anything you do,"" he answered. ""I'll be an artist,"
23447,CHAPTER I,"and I'll do things."""

23565,CHAPTER II,of Nile mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next
23566,CHAPTER II,few miles would be no light thing for the whale-boats to overpass. The
23567,CHAPTER II,"desert ran down almost to the banks, where, among gray, red, and black"
23568,CHAPTER II,"hillocks, a camel-corps was encamped. No man dared even for a day lose"
23569,CHAPTER II,touch of the slow-moving boats; there had been no fighting for weeks

23574,CHAPTER II,"something, they did not know what. Before them lay the Nile, and at the"
23575,CHAPTER II,"other end of it was one Gordon, fighting for the dear life, in a town"
23576,CHAPTER II,"called Khartoum. There were columns of British troops in the desert,"
23577,CHAPTER II,or in one of the many deserts; there were yet more columns waiting to
23578,CHAPTER II,embark on the river; there were fresh drafts waiting at Assioot and
23579,CHAPTER II,Assuan; there were lies and rumours running over the face of the
23580,CHAPTER II,"hopeless land from Suakin to the Sixth Cataract, and men supposed"
23581,CHAPTER II,generally that there must be some one in authority to direct the general
23582,CHAPTER II,scheme of the many movements. The duty of that particular river-column
23583,CHAPTER II,"was to keep the whale-boats afloat in the water, to avoid trampling"
23584,CHAPTER II,"on the villagers' crops when the gangs ""tracked"" the boats with lines"

23598,CHAPTER II,were worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the word. There were many

23687,CHAPTER II,"the eye of a horse-cope, the skill of a cook, the constitution of a"

23693,CHAPTER II,
23694,CHAPTER II,"Dick followed Torpenhow wherever the latter's fancy chose to lead him,"
23695,CHAPTER II,and between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost
23696,CHAPTER II,"satisfied themselves. It was not an easy life in any way, and under its"
23697,CHAPTER II,"influence the two were drawn very closely together, for they ate from"
23698,CHAPTER II,"the same dish, they shared the same water-bottle, and, most binding tie"
23699,CHAPTER II,"of all, their mails went off together. It was Dick who managed to make"
23700,CHAPTER II,gloriously drunk a telegraph-clerk in a palm hut far beyond the Second
23701,CHAPTER II,"Cataract, and, while the man lay in bliss on the floor, possessed"
23702,CHAPTER II,"himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive information, forwarded"
23703,CHAPTER II,"by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate, made a careful"
23704,CHAPTER II,"duplicate of the matter, and brought the result to Torpenhow, who said"
23705,CHAPTER II,"that all was fair in love or war correspondence, and built an excellent"
23706,CHAPTER II,descriptive article from his rival's riotous waste of words. It was
23707,CHAPTER II,"Torpenhow who--but the tale of their adventures, together and apart,"
23708,CHAPTER II,"from Philae to the waste wilderness of Herawi and Muella, would fill"
23709,CHAPTER II,"many books. They had been penned into a square side by side, in deadly"
23710,CHAPTER II,fear of being shot by over-excited soldiers; they had fought with
23711,CHAPTER II,baggage-camels in the chill dawn; they had jogged along in silence
23712,CHAPTER II,under blinding sun on indefatigable little Egyptian horses; and they had
23713,CHAPTER II,floundered on the shallows of the Nile when the whale-boat in which
23714,CHAPTER II,they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock and rip out half her
23715,CHAPTER II,bottom-planks.
23716,CHAPTER II,
23717,CHAPTER II,"Now they were sitting on the sand-bank, and the whale-boats were"

23745,CHAPTER II,
23746,CHAPTER II,"The camel-corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them, and"
23747,CHAPTER II,a hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the
23748,CHAPTER II,column had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it.
23749,CHAPTER II,"As swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind, the"
23750,CHAPTER II,rock-strewn ridges and scrub-topped hills were troubled and alive with
23751,CHAPTER II,armed men.
23752,CHAPTER II,
23753,CHAPTER II,"Mercifully, it occurred to these to stand far off for a time, to shout"
23754,CHAPTER II,and gesticulate joyously. One man even delivered himself of a long
23755,CHAPTER II,story. The camel-corps did not fire. They were only too glad of a little
23756,CHAPTER II,"breathing-space, until some sort of square could be formed. The men on"
23757,CHAPTER II,"the sand-bank ran to their side; and the whale-boats, as they toiled up"
23758,CHAPTER II,"within shouting distance, were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied"
23759,CHAPTER II,of all save the sick and a few men to guard them. The Arab orator ceased
23760,CHAPTER II,"his outcries, and his friends howled."
23761,CHAPTER II,
23762,CHAPTER II,"""They look like the Mahdi's men,"" said Torpenhow, elbowing himself"
23763,CHAPTER II,"into the crush of the square; ""but what thousands of 'em there are! The"
23764,CHAPTER II,"tribes hereabout aren't against us, I know."""
23765,CHAPTER II,

23771,CHAPTER II,"men!"""
23772,CHAPTER II,
23773,CHAPTER II,There was no need of any order. The men flung themselves panting against
23774,CHAPTER II,"the sides of the square, for they had good reason to know that whoso"
23775,CHAPTER II,was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in
23776,CHAPTER II,an extremely unpleasant fashion. The little hundred-and-fifty-pound
23777,CHAPTER II,camel-guns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the
23778,CHAPTER II,square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising
23779,CHAPTER II,"ground. All had fought in this manner many times before, and there"
23780,CHAPTER II,was no novelty in the entertainment; always the same hot and stifling
23781,CHAPTER II,"formation, the smell of dust and leather, the same boltlike rush of"
23782,CHAPTER II,"the enemy, the same pressure on the weakest side, the few minutes of"
23783,CHAPTER II,"hand-to-hand scuffle, and then the silence of the desert, broken only"
23784,CHAPTER II,by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse.
23785,CHAPTER II,"They had become careless. The camel-guns spoke at intervals, and the"
23786,CHAPTER II,square slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels. Then came the
23787,CHAPTER II,attack of three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is
23788,CHAPTER II,impossible for troops in close order to attack against breech-loading
23789,CHAPTER II,fire.
23790,CHAPTER II,
23791,CHAPTER II,"A few dropping shots heralded their approach, and a few horsemen led,"
23792,CHAPTER II,"but the bulk of the force was naked humanity, mad with rage, and armed"
23793,CHAPTER II,"with the spear and the sword. The instinct of the desert, where there"
23794,CHAPTER II,"is always much war, told them that the right flank of the square was the"
23795,CHAPTER II,"weakest, for they swung clear of the front. The camel-guns shelled them"
23796,CHAPTER II,"as they passed and opened for an instant lanes through their midst, most"
23797,CHAPTER II,like those quick-closing vistas in a Kentish hop-garden seen when the
23798,CHAPTER II,"train races by at full speed; and the infantry fire, held till the"
23799,CHAPTER II,"opportune moment, dropped them in close-packing hundreds. No civilised"
23800,CHAPTER II,"troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they came,"
23801,CHAPTER II,"the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels,"
23802,CHAPTER II,"the wounded cursing and staggering forward, till they fell--a torrent"
23803,CHAPTER II,black as the sliding water above a mill-dam--full on the right flank of
23804,CHAPTER II,the square.
23805,CHAPTER II,
23806,CHAPTER II,Then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead
23807,CHAPTER II,"went out in rolling smoke, and the little stones on the heated ground"
23808,CHAPTER II,and the tinder-dry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing
23809,CHAPTER II,"interest, for men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these"
23810,CHAPTER II,"things, counting mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble"
23811,CHAPTER II,and branch. There was no semblance of any concerted fighting. For aught
23812,CHAPTER II,"the men knew, the enemy might be attempting all four sides of the square"
23813,CHAPTER II,"at once. Their business was to destroy what lay in front of them, to"
23814,CHAPTER II,"bayonet in the back those who passed over them, and, dying, to drag"
23815,CHAPTER II,down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head by some avenging
23816,CHAPTER II,gun-butt.
23817,CHAPTER II,
23818,CHAPTER II,Dick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew
23819,CHAPTER II,unendurable. It was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack
23820,CHAPTER II,"was repulsed, so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest"
23821,CHAPTER II,"side of the square. There was a rush from without, the short hough-hough"
23822,CHAPTER II,"of the stabbing spears, and a man on a horse, followed by thirty or"
23823,CHAPTER II,"forty others, dashed through, yelling and hacking. The right flank of"
23824,CHAPTER II,"the square sucked in after them, and the other sides sent help. The"
23825,CHAPTER II,"wounded, who knew that they had but a few hours more to live, caught at"
23826,CHAPTER II,"the enemy's feet and brought them down, or, staggering into a discarded"
23827,CHAPTER II,"rifle, fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the"
23828,CHAPTER II,square.
23829,CHAPTER II,
23830,CHAPTER II,Dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his
23831,CHAPTER II,"helmet, that he had fired his revolver into a black, foam-flecked face"
23832,CHAPTER II,"which forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face, and that"
23833,CHAPTER II,"Torpenhow had gone down under an Arab whom he had tried to ""collar low,"""
23834,CHAPTER II,"and was turning over and over with his captive, feeling for the man's"
23835,CHAPTER II,"eyes. The doctor jabbed at a venture with a bayonet, and a helmetless"
23836,CHAPTER II,soldier fired over Dick's shoulder: the flying grains of powder stung
23837,CHAPTER II,his cheek. It was to Torpenhow that Dick turned by instinct. The
23838,CHAPTER II,representative of the Central Southern Syndicate had shaken himself
23839,CHAPTER II,"clear of his enemy, and rose, wiping his thumb on his trousers. The"
23840,CHAPTER II,"Arab, both hands to his forehead, screamed aloud, then snatched up his"
23841,CHAPTER II,"spear and rushed at Torpenhow, who was panting under shelter of Dick's"
23842,CHAPTER II,"revolver. Dick fired twice, and the man dropped limply. His upturned"
23843,CHAPTER II,"face lacked one eye. The musketry-fire redoubled, but cheers mingled"
23844,CHAPTER II,with it. The rush had failed and the enemy were flying. If the heart of
23845,CHAPTER II,"the square were shambles, the ground beyond was a butcher's shop. Dick"
23846,CHAPTER II,thrust his way forward between the maddened men. The remnant of the
23847,CHAPTER II,"enemy were retiring, as the few--the very few--English cavalry rode down"
23848,CHAPTER II,the laggards.
23849,CHAPTER II,
23850,CHAPTER II,"Beyond the lines of the dead, a broad blood-stained Arab spear cast"
23851,CHAPTER II,"aside in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub, and beyond this again"
23852,CHAPTER II,the illimitable dark levels of the desert. The sun caught the steel
23853,CHAPTER II,"and turned it into a red disc. Some one behind him was saying, ""Ah,"
23854,CHAPTER II,"get away, you brute!"" Dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the"
23855,CHAPTER II,"desert. His eye was held by the red splash in the distance, and the"
23856,CHAPTER II,"clamour about him seemed to die down to a very far-away whisper, like"
23857,CHAPTER II,the whisper of a level sea. There was the revolver and the red light.
23858,CHAPTER II,"... and the voice of some one scaring something away, exactly as had"
23859,CHAPTER II,"fallen somewhere before,--a darkness that stung. He fired at random, and"
23860,CHAPTER II,"the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered, ""Spoilt my aim."
23861,CHAPTER II,"There aren't any more cartridges. We shall have to run home."" He put his"
23862,CHAPTER II,hand to his head and brought it away covered with blood.
23863,CHAPTER II,
23864,CHAPTER II,"""Old man, you're cut rather badly,"" said Torpenhow. ""I owe you something"
23865,CHAPTER II,"for this business. Thanks. Stand up! I say, you can't be ill here."""
23866,CHAPTER II,
23867,CHAPTER II,"Throughout the night, when the troops were encamped by the whale-boats,"
23868,CHAPTER II,a black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sand-bar and
23869,CHAPTER II,"shouted that Khartoum the accursed one was dead,--was dead,--was"
23870,CHAPTER II,"dead,--that two steamers were rock-staked on the Nile outside the city,"
23871,CHAPTER II,and that of all their crews there remained not one; and Khartoum was
23872,CHAPTER II,"dead,--was dead,--was dead! But Torpenhow took no heed. He was watching"
23873,CHAPTER II,"Dick, who called aloud to the restless Nile for Maisie,--and again"
23874,CHAPTER II,"Maisie! ""Behold a phenomenon,"" said Torpenhow, rearranging the blanket."
23875,CHAPTER II,"""Here is a man, presumably human, who mentions the name of one woman"
23876,CHAPTER II,"only. And I've seen a good deal of delirium, too.--Dick, here's some"
23877,CHAPTER II,"fizzy drink."""

23892,CHAPTER III,THE SOUDAN campaign and Dick's broken head had been some months ended
23893,CHAPTER III,"and mended, and the Central Southern Syndicate had paid Dick a certain"
23894,CHAPTER III,"sum on account for work done, which work they were careful to assure him"
23895,CHAPTER III,was not altogether up to their standard. Dick heaved the letter into
23896,CHAPTER III,"the Nile at Cairo, cashed the draft in the same town, and bade a warm"
23897,CHAPTER III,farewell to Torpenhow at the station.
23898,CHAPTER III,
23899,CHAPTER III,"""I am going to lie up for a while and rest,"" said Torpenhow. ""I don't"
23900,CHAPTER III,"know where I shall live in London, but if God brings us to meet, we"
23901,CHAPTER III,shall meet. Are you staying here on the off-chance of another row? There
23902,CHAPTER III,will be none till the Southern Soudan is reoccupied by our troops. Mark
23903,CHAPTER III,that. Goodbye; bless you; come back when your money's spent; and give me
23904,CHAPTER III,"your address."""
23905,CHAPTER III,
23906,CHAPTER III,"Dick loitered in Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia, and Port Said,--especially"
23907,CHAPTER III,"Port Said. There is iniquity in many parts of the world, and vice in"
23908,CHAPTER III,"all, but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the"
23909,CHAPTER III,vices in all the continents finds itself at Port Said. And through the
23910,CHAPTER III,"heart of that sand-bordered hell, where the mirage flickers day long"
23911,CHAPTER III,"above the Bitter Lake, move, if you will only wait, most of the men and"
23912,CHAPTER III,women you have known in this life. Dick established himself in quarters
23913,CHAPTER III,"more riotous than respectable. He spent his evenings on the quay, and"
23914,CHAPTER III,"boarded many ships, and saw very many friends,--gracious Englishwomen"
23915,CHAPTER III,with whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of Shepherd's
23916,CHAPTER III,"Hotel, hurrying war correspondents, skippers of the contract troop-ships"
23917,CHAPTER III,"employed in the campaign, army officers by the score, and others of less"
23918,CHAPTER III,reputable trades.
23919,CHAPTER III,
23920,CHAPTER III,"He had choice of all the races of the East and West for studies, and"
23921,CHAPTER III,the advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong
23922,CHAPTER III,"excitement, at the gaming-tables, saloons, dancing-hells, and elsewhere."
23923,CHAPTER III,"For recreation there was the straight vista of the Canal, the blazing"
23924,CHAPTER III,"sands, the procession of shipping, and the white hospitals where the"
23925,CHAPTER III,English soldiers lay. He strove to set down in black and white and
23926,CHAPTER III,"colour all that Providence sent him, and when that supply was ended"
23927,CHAPTER III,"sought about for fresh material. It was a fascinating employment, but"
23928,CHAPTER III,"it ran away with his money, and he had drawn in advance the hundred and"
23929,CHAPTER III,"twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly. ""Now I shall have to work"
23930,CHAPTER III,"and starve!"" thought he, and was addressing himself to this new fate"
23931,CHAPTER III,"when a mysterious telegram arrived from Torpenhow in England, which"
23932,CHAPTER III,"said, ""Come back, quick; you have caught on. Come."""
23933,CHAPTER III,
23934,CHAPTER III,"A large smile overspread his face. ""So soon! that's a good hearing,"""
23935,CHAPTER III,"said he to himself. ""There will be an orgy tonight. I'll stand or fall"
23936,CHAPTER III,"by my luck. Faith, it's time it came!"" He deposited half of his funds"
23937,CHAPTER III,"in the hands of his well-known friends Monsieur and Madame Binat, and"
23938,CHAPTER III,ordered himself a Zanzibar dance of the finest. Monsieur Binat was
23939,CHAPTER III,"shaking with drink, but Madame smiles sympathetically--""Monsieur needs"
23940,CHAPTER III,"a chair, of course, and of course Monsieur will sketch; Monsieur amuses"
23941,CHAPTER III,"himself strangely."""
23942,CHAPTER III,
23943,CHAPTER III,"Binat raised a blue-white face from a cot in the inner room. ""I"
23944,CHAPTER III,"understand,"" he quavered. ""We all know Monsieur. Monsieur is an artist,"
23945,CHAPTER III,"as I have been."" Dick nodded. ""In the end,"" said Binat, with gravity,"
23946,CHAPTER III,"""Monsieur will descend alive into hell, as I have descended."" And he"
23947,CHAPTER III,laughed.
23948,CHAPTER III,
23949,CHAPTER III,"""You must come to the dance, too,"" said Dick; ""I shall want you."""
23950,CHAPTER III,
23951,CHAPTER III,"""For my face? I knew it would be so. For my face? My God! and for my"
23952,CHAPTER III,degradation so tremendous! I will not. Take him away. He is a devil.
23953,CHAPTER III,"Or at least do thou, Celeste, demand of him more."" The excellent Binat"
23954,CHAPTER III,began to kick and scream.
23955,CHAPTER III,
23956,CHAPTER III,"""All things are for sale in Port Said,"" said Madame. ""If my husband"
23957,CHAPTER III,"comes it will be so much more. Eh, how you call 'alf a sovereign."""
23958,CHAPTER III,
23959,CHAPTER III,"The money was paid, and the mad dance was held at night in a walled courtyard"
23960,CHAPTER III,"at the back of Madame Binat's house. The lady herself, in faded mauve"
23961,CHAPTER III,"silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders, played the piano,"
23962,CHAPTER III,and to the tin-pot music of a Western waltz the naked Zanzibari girls
23963,CHAPTER III,danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps. Binat sat upon a chair
23964,CHAPTER III,"and stared with eyes that saw nothing, till the whirl of the dance and"
23965,CHAPTER III,the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink that took the place
23966,CHAPTER III,"of blood in his veins, and his face glistened. Dick took him by the chin"
23967,CHAPTER III,brutally and turned that face to the light. Madame Binat looked over her
23968,CHAPTER III,shoulder and smiled with many teeth. Dick leaned against the wall and
23969,CHAPTER III,"sketched for an hour, till the kerosene lamps began to smell, and the"
23970,CHAPTER III,girls threw themselves panting on the hard-beaten ground. Then he shut
23971,CHAPTER III,"his book with a snap and moved away, Binat plucking feebly at his elbow."
23972,CHAPTER III,"""Show me,"" he whimpered. ""I too was once an artist, even I!"" Dick showed"
23973,CHAPTER III,"him the rough sketch. ""Am I that?"" he screamed. ""Will you take that away"
23974,CHAPTER III,"with you and show all the world that it is I,--Binat?"" He moaned and"
23975,CHAPTER III,wept.
23976,CHAPTER III,
23977,CHAPTER III,"""Monsieur has paid for all,"" said Madame. ""To the pleasure of seeing"
23978,CHAPTER III,"Monsieur again."""
23979,CHAPTER III,
23980,CHAPTER III,"The courtyard gate shut, and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the"
23981,CHAPTER III,"nearest gambling-hell, where he was well known. ""If the luck holds, it's"
23982,CHAPTER III,"an omen; if I lose, I must stay here."" He placed his money picturesquely"
23983,CHAPTER III,"about the board, hardly daring to look at what he did. The luck held."
23984,CHAPTER III,
23985,CHAPTER III,"Three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds, and he went"
23986,CHAPTER III,down to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed
23987,CHAPTER III,"cargo-steamer, who landed him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket"
23988,CHAPTER III,than he cared to think about.
23989,CHAPTER III,
23990,CHAPTER III,"A thin gray fog hung over the city, and the streets were very cold; for"
23991,CHAPTER III,summer was in England.
23992,CHAPTER III,
23993,CHAPTER III,"""It's a cheerful wilderness, and it hasn't the knack of altering much,"""
23994,CHAPTER III,"Dick thought, as he tramped from the Docks westward. ""Now, what must I"
23995,CHAPTER III,"do?"""
23996,CHAPTER III,
23997,CHAPTER III,The packed houses gave no answer. Dick looked down the long lightless
23998,CHAPTER III,"streets and at the appalling rush of traffic. ""Oh, you rabbit-hutches!"""
23999,CHAPTER III,"said he, addressing a row of highly respectable semi-detached"
24000,CHAPTER III,"residences. ""Do you know what you've got to do later on? You have to"
24001,CHAPTER III,"supply me with men-servants and maid-servants,""--here he smacked his"
24002,CHAPTER III,"lips,--""and the peculiar treasure of kings. Meantime I'll clothes and"
24003,CHAPTER III,"boots, and presently I will return and trample on you."" He stepped"
24004,CHAPTER III,forward energetically; he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the
24005,CHAPTER III,"side. As he stooped to make investigations, a man jostled him into the"
24006,CHAPTER III,"gutter. ""All right,"" he said. ""That's another nick in the score. I'll"
24007,CHAPTER III,"jostle you later on."""
24008,CHAPTER III,
24009,CHAPTER III,"Good clothes and boots are not cheap, and Dick left his last shop with"
24010,CHAPTER III,"the certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time, but with"
24011,CHAPTER III,"only fifty shillings in his pocket. He returned to streets by the Docks,"
24012,CHAPTER III,"and lodged himself in one room, where the sheets on the bed were almost"
24013,CHAPTER III,"audibly marked in case of theft, and where nobody seemed to go to bed at"
24014,CHAPTER III,all. When his clothes arrived he sought the Central Southern Syndicate
24015,CHAPTER III,"for Torpenhow's address, and got it, with the intimation that there was"
24016,CHAPTER III,still some money waiting for him.
24017,CHAPTER III,
24018,CHAPTER III,"""How much?"" said Dick, as one who habitually dealt in millions."
24019,CHAPTER III,
24020,CHAPTER III,"""Between thirty and forty pounds. If it would be any convenience to"
24021,CHAPTER III,"you, of course we could let you have it at once; but we usually settle"
24022,CHAPTER III,"accounts monthly."""
24023,CHAPTER III,
24024,CHAPTER III,"""If I show that I want anything now, I'm lost,"" he said to himself. ""All"
24025,CHAPTER III,"I need I'll take later on."" Then, aloud, ""It's hardly worth while; and"
24026,CHAPTER III,"I'm going to the country for a month, too. Wait till I come back, and"
24027,CHAPTER III,"I'll see about it."""
24028,CHAPTER III,
24029,CHAPTER III,"""But we trust, Mr. Heldar, that you do not intend to sever your"
24030,CHAPTER III,"connection with us?"""
24031,CHAPTER III,
24032,CHAPTER III,"Dick's business in life was the study of faces, and he watched the speaker"
24033,CHAPTER III,"keenly. ""That man means something,"" he said. ""I'll do no business till"
24034,CHAPTER III,"I've seen Torpenhow. There's a big deal coming."" So he departed, making"
24035,CHAPTER III,"no promises, to his one little room by the Docks. And that day was"
24036,CHAPTER III,"the seventh of the month, and that month, he reckoned with awful"
24037,CHAPTER III,"distinctness, had thirty-one days in it! It is not easy for a man of"
24038,CHAPTER III,catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twenty-four days on
24039,CHAPTER III,fifty shillings. Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in
24040,CHAPTER III,all the loneliness of London. Dick paid seven shillings a week for his
24041,CHAPTER III,"lodging, which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and"
24042,CHAPTER III,"drink. Naturally, his first purchase was of the materials of his craft;"
24043,CHAPTER III,he had been without them too long. Half a day's investigations and
24044,CHAPTER III,comparison brought him to the conclusion that sausages and mashed
24045,CHAPTER III,"potatoes, twopence a plate, were the best food. Now, sausages once or"
24046,CHAPTER III,"twice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant. As lunch, even, with"
24047,CHAPTER III,"mashed potatoes, they become monotonous. At dinner they are impertinent."
24048,CHAPTER III,"At the end of three days Dick loathed sausages, and, going, forth,"
24049,CHAPTER III,"pawned his watch to revel on sheep's head, which is not as cheap as it"
24050,CHAPTER III,"looks, owing to the bones and the gravy. Then he returned to sausages"
24051,CHAPTER III,and mashed potatoes. Then he confined himself entirely to mashed
24052,CHAPTER III,"potatoes for a day, and was unhappy because of pain in his inside. Then"
24053,CHAPTER III,"he pawned his waistcoat and his tie, and thought regretfully of money"
24054,CHAPTER III,thrown away in times past. There are few things more edifying unto
24055,CHAPTER III,"Art than the actual belly-pinch of hunger, and Dick in his few walks"
24056,CHAPTER III,"abroad,--he did not care for exercise; it raised desires that could not"
24057,CHAPTER III,"be satisfied--found himself dividing mankind into two classes,--those"
24058,CHAPTER III,"who looked as if they might give him something to eat, and those who"
24059,CHAPTER III,"looked otherwise. ""I never knew what I had to learn about the human"
24060,CHAPTER III,"face before,"" he thought; and, as a reward for his humility, Providence"
24061,CHAPTER III,caused a cab-driver at a sausage-shop where Dick fed that night to leave
24062,CHAPTER III,"half eaten a great chunk of bread. Dick took it,--would have fought all"
24063,CHAPTER III,"the world for its possession,--and it cheered him."
24064,CHAPTER III,
24065,CHAPTER III,"The month dragged through at last, and, nearly prancing with impatience,"
24066,CHAPTER III,he went to draw his money. Then he hastened to Torpenhow's address
24067,CHAPTER III,and smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the
24068,CHAPTER III,"chambers. Torpenhow was on the top floor, and Dick burst into his room,"
24069,CHAPTER III,"to be received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs, as Torpenhow"
24070,CHAPTER III,dragged him to the light and spoke of twenty different things in the
24071,CHAPTER III,same breath.
24072,CHAPTER III,
24073,CHAPTER III,"""But you're looking tucked up,"" he concluded."
24074,CHAPTER III,
24075,CHAPTER III,"""Got anything to eat?"" said Dick, his eye roaming round the room."
24076,CHAPTER III,
24077,CHAPTER III,"""I shall be having breakfast in a minute. What do you say to sausages?"""
24078,CHAPTER III,
24079,CHAPTER III,"""No, anything but sausages! Torp, I've been starving on that accursed"
24080,CHAPTER III,"horse-flesh for thirty days and thirty nights."""
24081,CHAPTER III,
24082,CHAPTER III,"""Now, what lunacy has been your latest?"""
24083,CHAPTER III,
24084,CHAPTER III,Dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech. Then he opened
24085,CHAPTER III,"his coat; there was no waistcoat below. ""I ran it fine, awfully fine,"
24086,CHAPTER III,"but I've just scraped through."""
24087,CHAPTER III,
24088,CHAPTER III,"""You haven't much sense, but you've got a backbone, anyhow. Eat, and"
24089,CHAPTER III,"talk afterwards."" Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could"
24090,CHAPTER III,"gorge no more. Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe, and he smoked as men"
24091,CHAPTER III,smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco.
24092,CHAPTER III,
24093,CHAPTER III,"""Ouf!"" said he. ""That's heavenly! Well?"""
24094,CHAPTER III,
24095,CHAPTER III,"""Why in the world didn't you come to me?"""
24096,CHAPTER III,
24097,CHAPTER III,"""Couldn't; I owe you too much already, old man. Besides I had a sort of"
24098,CHAPTER III,"superstition that this temporary starvation--that's what it was, and it"
24099,CHAPTER III,"hurt--would bring me luck later. It's over and done with now, and none"
24100,CHAPTER III,of the syndicate know how hard up I was. Fire away. What's the exact
24101,CHAPTER III,"state of affairs as regards myself?"""
24102,CHAPTER III,
24103,CHAPTER III,"""You had my wire? You've caught on here. People like your work"
24104,CHAPTER III,"immensely. I don't know why, but they do. They say you have a fresh"

24120,CHAPTER III,please. I appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you
24121,CHAPTER III,"here, and I have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches"
24122,CHAPTER III,you gave me from time to time. Those coming after your work on the
24123,CHAPTER III,Central Southern Syndicate appear to have done your business. You're in

24125,CHAPTER III,
24126,CHAPTER III,"""Huh! call it luck! Do call it luck, when a man has been kicking about"
24127,CHAPTER III,"the world like a dog, waiting for it to come! I'll luck 'em later on. I"
24128,CHAPTER III,"want a place to work first."""
24129,CHAPTER III,
24130,CHAPTER III,"""Come here,"" said Torpenhow, crossing the landing. ""This place is a big"
24131,CHAPTER III,"box room really, but it will do for you. There's your skylight, or"
24132,CHAPTER III,"your north light, or whatever window you call it, and plenty of room to"
24133,CHAPTER III,"thrash about in, and a bedroom beyond. What more do you need?"""
24134,CHAPTER III,
24135,CHAPTER III,"""Good enough,"" said Dick, looking round the large room that took up a"
24136,CHAPTER III,third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames. A
24137,CHAPTER III,pale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of
24138,CHAPTER III,"the place. Three steps led from the door to the landing, and three"
24139,CHAPTER III,more to Torpenhow's room. The well of the staircase disappeared into
24140,CHAPTER III,"darkness, pricked by tiny gas-jets, and there were sounds of men talking"
24141,CHAPTER III,"and doors slamming seven flights below, in the warm gloom."
24142,CHAPTER III,
24143,CHAPTER III,"""Do they give you a free hand here?"" said Dick, cautiously. He was"
24144,CHAPTER III,Ishmael enough to know the value of liberty.
24145,CHAPTER III,
24146,CHAPTER III,"""Anything you like; latch-keys and license unlimited. We are permanent"
24147,CHAPTER III,tenants for the most part here. 'Tisn't a place I would recommend for a

24151,CHAPTER III,"""You're a great deal too kind, old man."""
24152,CHAPTER III,
24153,CHAPTER III,"""You didn't suppose you were going away from me, did you?"" Torpenhow put"
24154,CHAPTER III,"his hand on Dick's shoulder, and the two walked up and down the room,"
24155,CHAPTER III,"henceforward to be called the studio, in sweet and silent communion."
24156,CHAPTER III,"They heard rapping at Torpenhow's door. ""That's some ruffian come up"
24157,CHAPTER III,"for a drink,"" said Torpenhow; and he raised his voice cheerily. There"
24158,CHAPTER III,entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middle-aged gentleman in
24159,CHAPTER III,"a satin-faced frockcoat. His lips were parted and pale, and there were"
24160,CHAPTER III,deep pouches under the eyes.
24161,CHAPTER III,
24162,CHAPTER III,"""Weak heart,"" said Dick to himself, and, as he shook hands, ""very weak"
24163,CHAPTER III,"heart. His pulse is shaking his fingers."""
24164,CHAPTER III,
24165,CHAPTER III,The man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern Syndicate
24166,CHAPTER III,"and ""one of the most ardent admirers of your work, Mr. Heldar. I assure"
24167,CHAPTER III,"you, in the name of the syndicate, that we are immensely indebted to"
24168,CHAPTER III,"you; and I trust, Mr. Heldar, you won't forget that we were largely"
24169,CHAPTER III,"instrumental in bringing you before the public."" He panted because of"
24170,CHAPTER III,the seven flights of stairs.
24171,CHAPTER III,
24172,CHAPTER III,"Dick glanced at Torpenhow, whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on"
24173,CHAPTER III,his cheek.
24174,CHAPTER III,
24175,CHAPTER III,"""I shan't forget,"" said Dick, every instinct of defence roused in him."
24176,CHAPTER III,
24177,CHAPTER III,"""You've paid me so well that I couldn't, you know. By the way, when I am"
24178,CHAPTER III,settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches. There
24179,CHAPTER III,"must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you."""
24180,CHAPTER III,
24181,CHAPTER III,"""That is er--is what I came to speak about. I fear we can't allow it"
24182,CHAPTER III,"exactly, Mr. Heldar. In the absence of any specified agreement, the"

24187,CHAPTER III,"""Yes; and we hope to have your help, on your own terms, Mr. Heldar, to"

24194,CHAPTER III,"I've got in the world!"""
24195,CHAPTER III,
24196,CHAPTER III,Torpenhow watched Dick's face and whistled.
24197,CHAPTER III,
24198,CHAPTER III,"Dick walked up and down, thinking. He saw the whole of his little stock"
24199,CHAPTER III,"in trade, the first weapon of his equipment, annexed at the outset of"
24200,CHAPTER III,his campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught
24201,CHAPTER III,"aright, who said that he represented a syndicate, which was a thing for"
24202,CHAPTER III,which Dick had not the least reverence. The injustice of the proceedings
24203,CHAPTER III,did not much move him; he had seen the strong hand prevail too often in
24204,CHAPTER III,other places to be squeamish over the moral aspects of right and wrong.
24205,CHAPTER III,
24206,CHAPTER III,"But he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat,"
24207,CHAPTER III,"and when he spoke again, it was with a strained sweetness that Torpenhow"
24208,CHAPTER III,knew well for the beginning of strife.
24209,CHAPTER III,
24210,CHAPTER III,"""Forgive me, sir, but you have no--no younger man who can arrange this"
24211,CHAPTER III,"business with me?"""
24212,CHAPTER III,
24213,CHAPTER III,"""I speak for the syndicate. I see no reason for a third party to----"""
24214,CHAPTER III,
24215,CHAPTER III,"""You will in a minute. Be good enough to give back my sketches."""
24216,CHAPTER III,
24217,CHAPTER III,"The man stared blankly at Dick, and then at Torpenhow, who was leaning"
24218,CHAPTER III,against the wall. He was not used to ex-employees who ordered him to be
24219,CHAPTER III,good enough to do things.
24220,CHAPTER III,
24221,CHAPTER III,"""Yes, it is rather a cold-blooded steal,"" said Torpenhow, critically;"
24222,CHAPTER III,"""but I'm afraid, I am very much afraid, you've struck the wrong man. Be"
24223,CHAPTER III,"careful, Dick; remember, this isn't the Soudan."""
24224,CHAPTER III,
24225,CHAPTER III,"""Considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your"
24226,CHAPTER III,"name before the world----"""
24227,CHAPTER III,
24228,CHAPTER III,This was not a fortunate remark; it reminded Dick of certain vagrant
24229,CHAPTER III,years lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires. The
24230,CHAPTER III,memory did not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed
24231,CHAPTER III,to enjoy the fruit of those years.
24232,CHAPTER III,
24233,CHAPTER III,"""I don't know quite what to do with you,"" began Dick, meditatively. ""Of"
24234,CHAPTER III,"course you're a thief, and you ought to be half killed, but in your case"
24235,CHAPTER III,"you'd probably die. I don't want you dead on this floor, and, besides,"
24236,CHAPTER III,"it's unlucky just as one's moving in. Don't hit, sir; you'll only excite"
24237,CHAPTER III,"yourself."""
24238,CHAPTER III,
24239,CHAPTER III,He put one hand on the man's forearm and ran the other down the plump
24240,CHAPTER III,"body beneath the coat. ""My goodness!"" said he to Torpenhow, ""and this"
24241,CHAPTER III,gray oaf dares to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh camel-driver have the
24242,CHAPTER III,black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet
24243,CHAPTER III,"dates, and he was as tough as whipcord. This thing's soft all over--like"
24244,CHAPTER III,"a woman."""
24245,CHAPTER III,
24246,CHAPTER III,There are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by
24247,CHAPTER III,a man who does not intend to strike. The head of the syndicate began to
24248,CHAPTER III,"breathe heavily. Dick walked round him, pawing him, as a cat paws a"
24249,CHAPTER III,soft hearth-rug. Then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches
24250,CHAPTER III,"underneath the eyes, and shook his head. ""You were going to steal my"
24251,CHAPTER III,"things,--mine, mine, mine!--you, who don't know when you may die. Write"
24252,CHAPTER III,"a note to your office,--you say you're the head of it,--and order them"
24253,CHAPTER III,"to give Torpenhow my sketches,--every one of them. Wait a minute: your"
24254,CHAPTER III,"hand's shaking. Now!"" He thrust a pocket-book before him. The note"
24255,CHAPTER III,"was written. Torpenhow took it and departed without a word, while Dick"
24256,CHAPTER III,"walked round and round the spellbound captive, giving him such advice as"
24257,CHAPTER III,he conceived best for the welfare of his soul. When Torpenhow returned
24258,CHAPTER III,"with a gigantic portfolio, he heard Dick say, almost soothingly, ""Now,"
24259,CHAPTER III,I hope this will be a lesson to you; and if you worry me when I have
24260,CHAPTER III,"settled down to work with any nonsense about actions for assault,"
24261,CHAPTER III,"believe me, I'll catch you and manhandle you, and you'll die. You"
24262,CHAPTER III,"haven't very long to live, anyhow. Go! Imshi, Vootsak,--get out!"" The"
24263,CHAPTER III,"man departed, staggering and dazed. Dick drew a long breath: ""Phew! what"
24264,CHAPTER III,a lawless lot these people are! The first thing a poor orphan meets is
24265,CHAPTER III,"gang robbery, organised burglary! Think of the hideous blackness of that"
24266,CHAPTER III,"man's mind! Are my sketches all right, Torp?"""
24267,CHAPTER III,
24268,CHAPTER III,"""Yes; one hundred and forty-seven of them. Well, I must say, Dick,"
24269,CHAPTER III,"you've begun well."""
24270,CHAPTER III,
24271,CHAPTER III,"""He was interfering with me. It only meant a few pounds to him, but it"
24272,CHAPTER III,was everything to me. I don't think he'll bring an action. I gave him
24273,CHAPTER III,some medical advice gratis about the state of his body. It was cheap at
24274,CHAPTER III,"the little flurry it cost him. Now, let's look at my things."""
24275,CHAPTER III,
24276,CHAPTER III,Two minutes later Dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep
24277,CHAPTER III,"in the portfolio, chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and"
24278,CHAPTER III,thought of the price at which they had been bought.
24279,CHAPTER III,
24280,CHAPTER III,The afternoon was well advanced when Torpenhow came to the door and saw
24281,CHAPTER III,Dick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight.
24282,CHAPTER III,
24283,CHAPTER III,"""I builded better than I knew, Torp,"" he said, without stopping the"
24284,CHAPTER III,"dance. ""They're good! They're damned good! They'll go like flame! I"
24285,CHAPTER III,shall have an exhibition of them on my own brazen hook. And that man

24288,CHAPTER III,
24289,CHAPTER III,"""Go out,"" said Torpenhow,--""go out and pray to be delivered from the"

24312,CHAPTER IV,"""WELL, and how does success taste?"" said Torpenhow, some three months"
24313,CHAPTER IV,later. He had just returned to chambers after a holiday in the country.

24322,CHAPTER IV,
24323,CHAPTER IV,Torpenhow was sprawling in a long chair with a small fox-terrier asleep
24324,CHAPTER IV,"on his chest, while Dick was preparing a canvas. A dais, a background,"
24325,CHAPTER IV,and a lay-figure were the only fixed objects in the place. They rose
24326,CHAPTER IV,"from a wreck of oddments that began with felt-covered water-bottles,"
24327,CHAPTER IV,"belts, and regimental badges, and ended with a small bale of second-hand"
24328,CHAPTER IV,uniforms and a stand of mixed arms. The mark of muddy feet on the dais
24329,CHAPTER IV,showed that a military model had just gone away. The watery autumn
24330,CHAPTER IV,"sunlight was falling, and shadows sat in the corners of the studio."

24344,CHAPTER IV,scratched them on camel-bone instead of using mere black and white and
24345,CHAPTER IV,"colour. Verily, they are a queer gang, these people. Limited isn't the"
24346,CHAPTER IV,word to describe 'em. I met a fellow the other day who told me
24347,CHAPTER IV,that it was impossible that shadows on white sand should be
24348,CHAPTER IV,"blue,--ultramarine,--as they are. I found out, later, that the man had"

24613,CHAPTER IV,Dick had instinctively sought running water for a comfort to his mood of
24614,CHAPTER IV,"mind. He was leaning over the Embankment wall, watching the rush of the"

24616,CHAPTER IV,"Torpenhow's advice, but, as of custom, lost himself in the study of the"
24617,CHAPTER IV,"faces flocking past. Some had death written on their features, and Dick"
24618,CHAPTER IV,"marvelled that they could laugh. Others, clumsy and coarse-built for"
24619,CHAPTER IV,"the most part, were alight with love; others were merely drawn and lined"
24620,CHAPTER IV,"with work; but there was something, Dick knew, to be made out of them"
24621,CHAPTER IV,"all. The poor at least should suffer that he might learn, and the rich"
24622,CHAPTER IV,should pay for the output of his learning. Thus his credit in the world
24623,CHAPTER IV,and his cash balance at the bank would be increased. So much the better
24624,CHAPTER IV,for him. He had suffered. Now he would take toll of the ills of others.
24625,CHAPTER IV,
24626,CHAPTER IV,"The fog was driven apart for a moment, and the sun shone, a blood-red"

24628,CHAPTER IV,the tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low
24629,CHAPTER IV,"tide. A girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly, ""Ah, get"
24630,CHAPTER IV,"away, you beast!"" and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog"
24631,CHAPTER IV,drove across Dick's face the black smoke of a river-steamer at her berth
24632,CHAPTER IV,"below the wall. He was blinded for the moment, then spun round and found"
24633,CHAPTER IV,himself face to face with--Maisie.
24634,CHAPTER IV,
24635,CHAPTER IV,"There was no mistaking. The years had turned the child to a woman, but"
24636,CHAPTER IV,"they had not altered the dark-gray eyes, the thin scarlet lips, or the"
24637,CHAPTER IV,"firmly modelled mouth and chin; and, that all should be as it was of"
24638,CHAPTER IV,"old, she wore a closely fitting gray dress."
24639,CHAPTER IV,
24640,CHAPTER IV,Since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own

24643,CHAPTER IV,and before the brain newly released from considerations of the cash

24647,CHAPTER IV,"but Dick fell into step at her side, and the two paced the Embankment"

24851,CHAPTER V,"Maisie, white with rage, had cuffed him. How long those four years"

24864,CHAPTER V,
24865,CHAPTER V,Dick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind

24869,CHAPTER V,

24873,CHAPTER V,
24874,CHAPTER V,"She was walking towards him from the Marble Arch, and he saw that no"

24947,CHAPTER V,
24948,CHAPTER V,"""They've chucked the off lead-'orse"" said one to the other. ""'E's tore"

24956,CHAPTER V,
24957,CHAPTER V,"Dick watched Maisie's face and swelled with joy--fine, rank, vulgar"
24958,CHAPTER V,triumph. She was more interested in the little crowd than in the
24959,CHAPTER V,picture.
24960,CHAPTER V,
24961,CHAPTER V,That was something that she could understand.
24962,CHAPTER V,
24963,CHAPTER V,"""And I wanted it so! Oh, I did want it so!"" she said at last, under her"
24964,CHAPTER V,breath.
24965,CHAPTER V,
24966,CHAPTER V,"""Me,--all me!"" said Dick, placidly. ""Look at their faces. It hits 'em."
24967,CHAPTER V,They don't know what makes their eyes and mouths open; but I know. And I

24969,CHAPTER V,
24970,CHAPTER V,"""Yes. I see. Oh, what a thing to have come to one!"""
24971,CHAPTER V,

24976,CHAPTER V,
24977,CHAPTER V,"They returned to the Park, and Dick delivered himself of the saga of his"

24979,CHAPTER V,
24980,CHAPTER V,"From the beginning he told the tale, the I--I--I's flashing through the"
24981,CHAPTER V,records as telegraph-poles fly past the traveller. Maisie listened and
24982,CHAPTER V,nodded her head. The histories of strife and privation did not move her
24983,CHAPTER V,"a hair's-breadth. At the end of each canto he would conclude, ""And that"
24984,CHAPTER V,"gave me some notion of handling colour,"" or light, or whatever it might"

24986,CHAPTER V,"across half the world, speaking as he had never spoken in his life"
24987,CHAPTER V,before.
24988,CHAPTER V,
24989,CHAPTER V,And in the flood-tide of his exaltation there came upon him a great
24990,CHAPTER V,"desire to pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said, ""I"
24991,CHAPTER V,"understand. Go on,""--to pick her up and carry her away with him, because"
24992,CHAPTER V,"she was Maisie, and because she understood, and because she was his"
24993,CHAPTER V,"right, and a woman to be desired above all women."
24994,CHAPTER V,
24995,CHAPTER V,"Then he checked himself abruptly. ""And so I took all I wanted,"" he said,"
24996,CHAPTER V,"""and I had to fight for it. Now you tell."""
24997,CHAPTER V,
24998,CHAPTER V,Maisie's tale was almost as gray as her dress. It covered years of
24999,CHAPTER V,patient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken though
25000,CHAPTER V,"dealers laughed, and fogs delayed work, and Kami was unkind and even"
25001,CHAPTER V,"sarcastic, and girls in other studios were painfully polite. It had a"
25002,CHAPTER V,"few bright spots, in pictures accepted at provincial exhibitions, but"
25003,CHAPTER V,"it wound up with the oft repeated wail, ""And so you see, Dick, I had no"
25004,CHAPTER V,"success, though I worked so hard."""
25005,CHAPTER V,
25006,CHAPTER V,Then pity filled Dick. Even thus had Maisie spoken when she could not
25007,CHAPTER V,"hit the breakwater, half an hour before she had kissed him. And that had"
25008,CHAPTER V,happened yesterday.
25009,CHAPTER V,
25010,CHAPTER V,"""Never mind,"" he said. ""I'll tell you something, if you'll believe it."""
25011,CHAPTER V,"The words were shaping themselves of their own accord. ""The whole thing,"

25036,CHAPTER V,
25037,CHAPTER V,"""I beg your pardon, darling. It's my fault for speaking stupidly. I"

25047,CHAPTER V,her.
25048,CHAPTER V,
25049,CHAPTER V,"""It's wrong of me,"" said Maisie, more slowly than before; ""it's wrong"

25061,CHAPTER V,
25062,CHAPTER V,"""Yes; but remember, Dick, nothing will ever come of it. That's why I"

25132,CHAPTER V,"world, to use me! But then she's Maisie. There's no getting over that"
25133,CHAPTER V,fact; and it's good to see her again. This business must have been
25134,CHAPTER V,simmering at the back of my head for years.... She'll use me as I
25135,CHAPTER V,used Binat at Port Said. She's quite right. It will hurt a little.
25136,CHAPTER V,"I shall have to see her every Sunday,--like a young man courting a"
25137,CHAPTER V,housemaid. She's sure to come around; and yet--that mouth isn't a
25138,CHAPTER V,"yielding mouth. I shall be wanting to kiss her all the time, and I shall"
25139,CHAPTER V,"have to look at her pictures,--I don't even know what sort of work she"
25140,CHAPTER V,"does yet,--and I shall have to talk about Art,--Woman's Art! Therefore,"
25141,CHAPTER V,"particularly and perpetually, damn all varieties of Art. It did me a"

25144,CHAPTER V,"Half-way to the studio, Dick was smitten with a terrible thought. The"
25145,CHAPTER V,figure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it.
25146,CHAPTER V,
25147,CHAPTER V,"""She's all alone in London, with a red-haired impressionist girl, who"
25148,CHAPTER V,probably has the digestion of an ostrich. Most red-haired people have.
25149,CHAPTER V,"Maisie's a bilious little body. They'll eat like lone women,--meals at"
25150,CHAPTER V,"all hours, and tea with all meals. I remember how the students in Paris"
25151,CHAPTER V,"used to pig along. She may fall ill at any minute, and I shan't be able"
25152,CHAPTER V,"to help. Whew! this is ten times worse than owning a wife."""
25153,CHAPTER V,
25154,CHAPTER V,"Torpenhow entered the studio at dusk, and looked at Dick with eyes full"
25155,CHAPTER V,of the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the
25156,CHAPTER V,same oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of
25157,CHAPTER V,"toil. This is a good love, and, since it allows, and even encourages,"
25158,CHAPTER V,"strife, recrimination, and brutal sincerity, does not die, but grows,"
25159,CHAPTER V,and is proof against any absence and evil conduct.
25160,CHAPTER V,
25161,CHAPTER V,Dick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council. He
25162,CHAPTER V,thought of Maisie and her possible needs. It was a new thing to think of
25163,CHAPTER V,"anybody but Torpenhow, who could think for himself. Here at last was an"
25164,CHAPTER V,outlet for that cash balance. He could adorn Maisie barbarically with
25165,CHAPTER V,"jewelry,--a thick gold necklace round that little neck, bracelets"
25166,CHAPTER V,"upon the rounded arms, and rings of price upon her hands,--the cool,"
25167,CHAPTER V,"temperate, ringless hands that he had taken between his own. It was an"
25168,CHAPTER V,"absurd thought, for Maisie would not even allow him to put one ring on"
25169,CHAPTER V,"one finger, and she would laugh at golden trappings. It would be better"
25170,CHAPTER V,"to sit with her quietly in the dusk, his arm around her neck and her"
25171,CHAPTER V,"face on his shoulder, as befitted husband and wife. Torpenhow's boots"
25172,CHAPTER V,"creaked that night, and his strong voice jarred. Dick's brows contracted"
25173,CHAPTER V,and he murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as a
25174,CHAPTER V,"right and part payment for past discomfort, and now he was checked in"
25175,CHAPTER V,his stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly
25176,CHAPTER V,care for him.
25177,CHAPTER V,
25178,CHAPTER V,"""I say, old man,"" said Torpenhow, who had made one or two vain attempts"

25244,CHAPTER VI,"eyes of the red-haired impressionist girl, whom he learned to hate"
25245,CHAPTER VI,"at sight,--and was tingling with a keen sense of shame. Sunday after"
25246,CHAPTER VI,"Sunday, putting on his best clothes, he had walked over to the untidy"
25247,CHAPTER VI,"house north of the Park, first to see Maisie's pictures, and then to"
25248,CHAPTER VI,criticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were productions
25249,CHAPTER VI,"on which advice would not be wasted. Sunday after Sunday, and his love"
25250,CHAPTER VI,"grew with each visit, he had been compelled to cram his heart back from"
25251,CHAPTER VI,between his lips when it prompted him to kiss Maisie several times and
25252,CHAPTER VI,"very much indeed. Sunday after Sunday, the head above the heart had"
25253,CHAPTER VI,"warned him that Maisie was not yet attainable, and that it would be"
25254,CHAPTER VI,better to talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the
25255,CHAPTER VI,craft that was all in all to her. Therefore it was his fate to endure
25256,CHAPTER VI,weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy back garden of a
25257,CHAPTER VI,frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in its right place and
25258,CHAPTER VI,"nobody every called,--to endure and to watch Maisie moving to and fro"
25259,CHAPTER VI,"with the teacups. He abhorred tea, but, since it gave him a little"
25260,CHAPTER VI,"longer time in her presence, he drank it devoutly, and the red-haired"
25261,CHAPTER VI,girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking. She was always
25262,CHAPTER VI,watching him.
25263,CHAPTER VI,
25264,CHAPTER VI,"Once, and only once, when she had left the studio, Maisie showed him"
25265,CHAPTER VI,"an album that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papers,--the"

25267,CHAPTER VI,exhibitions. Dick stooped and kissed the paint-smudged thumb on the open
25268,CHAPTER VI,"page. ""Oh, my love, my love,"" he muttered, ""do you value these things?"
25269,CHAPTER VI,"Chuck 'em into the waste-paper basket!"""
25270,CHAPTER VI,
25271,CHAPTER VI,"""Not till I get something better,"" said Maisie, shutting the book."
25272,CHAPTER VI,
25273,CHAPTER VI,"Then Dick, moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for"
25274,CHAPTER VI,"the maiden, did deliberately propose, in order to secure more of these"
25275,CHAPTER VI,"coveted cuttings, that he should paint a picture which Maisie should"
25276,CHAPTER VI,sign.
25277,CHAPTER VI,
25278,CHAPTER VI,"""That's childish,"" said Maisie, ""and I didn't think it of you. It must"
25279,CHAPTER VI,"be my work. Mine,--mine,--mine!"""
25280,CHAPTER VI,
25281,CHAPTER VI,"""Go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers' houses. You are"
25282,CHAPTER VI,"thoroughly good at that."" Dick was sick and savage."
25283,CHAPTER VI,
25284,CHAPTER VI,"""Better things than medallions, Dick,"" was the answer, in tones that"
25285,CHAPTER VI,recalled a gray-eyed atom's fearless speech to Mrs. Jennett. Dick would
25286,CHAPTER VI,"have abased himself utterly, but that other girl trailed in."
25287,CHAPTER VI,
25288,CHAPTER VI,Next Sunday he laid at Maisie's feet small gifts of pencils that could
25289,CHAPTER VI,"almost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed,"
25290,CHAPTER VI,"and he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand. It demanded,"
25291,CHAPTER VI,"among other things, an exposition of the faith that was in him."
25292,CHAPTER VI,
25293,CHAPTER VI,Torpenhow's hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with
25294,CHAPTER VI,which Dick preached his own gospel of Art.
25295,CHAPTER VI,
25296,CHAPTER VI,"A month before, Dick would have been equally astonished; but it was"
25297,CHAPTER VI,"Maisie's will and pleasure, and he dragged his words together to make"
25298,CHAPTER VI,plain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the
25299,CHAPTER VI,whys and wherefores of work. There is not the least difficulty in doing
25300,CHAPTER VI,a thing if you only know how to do it; the trouble is to explain your
25301,CHAPTER VI,method.
25302,CHAPTER VI,
25303,CHAPTER VI,"""I could put this right if I had a brush in my hand,"" said Dick,"
25304,CHAPTER VI,"despairingly, over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would"
25305,CHAPTER VI,"not ""look flesh,""--it was the same chin that she had scraped out with"
25306,CHAPTER VI,"the palette knife,--""but I find it almost impossible to teach you."
25307,CHAPTER VI,There's a queer grim Dutch touch about your painting that I like; but
25308,CHAPTER VI,I've a notion that you're weak in drawing. You foreshorten as though you
25309,CHAPTER VI,"never used the model, and you've caught Kami's pasty way of dealing with"
25310,CHAPTER VI,"flesh in shadow. Then, again, though you don't know it yourself, you"
25311,CHAPTER VI,shirk hard work. Suppose you spend some of your time on line lone. Line
25312,CHAPTER VI,"doesn't allow of shirking. Oils do, and three square inches of flashy,"
25313,CHAPTER VI,"tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing off,--as"
25314,CHAPTER VI,"I know. That's immoral. Do line-work for a little while, and then I can"
25315,CHAPTER VI,"tell more about your powers, as old Kami used to say."""
25316,CHAPTER VI,
25317,CHAPTER VI,Maisie protested; she did not care for the pure line.
25318,CHAPTER VI,
25319,CHAPTER VI,"""I know,"" said Dick. ""You want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of"
25320,CHAPTER VI,"flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling."" The red-haired"
25321,CHAPTER VI,"girl laughed a little. ""You want to do landscapes with cattle knee-deep"
25322,CHAPTER VI,in grass to hide bad drawing. You want to do a great deal more than
25323,CHAPTER VI,"you can do. You have sense of colour, but you want form. Colour's a"
25324,CHAPTER VI,"gift,--put it aside and think no more about it,--but form you can be"
25325,CHAPTER VI,"drilled into. Now, all your fancy heads--and some of them are very"
25326,CHAPTER VI,good--will keep you exactly where you are. With line you must go forward
25327,CHAPTER VI,"or backward, and it will show up all your weaknesses."""
25328,CHAPTER VI,
25329,CHAPTER VI,"""But other people----"" began Maisie."
25330,CHAPTER VI,
25331,CHAPTER VI,"""You mustn't mind what other people do. If their souls were your soul,"
25332,CHAPTER VI,"it would be different. You stand and fall by your own work, remember,"
25333,CHAPTER VI,"and it's waste of time to think of any one else in this battle."""
25334,CHAPTER VI,
25335,CHAPTER VI,"Dick paused, and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came"
25336,CHAPTER VI,"back into his eyes. He looked at Maisie, and the look asked as plainly"
25337,CHAPTER VI,"as words, Was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas"
25338,CHAPTER VI,and counsel and join hands with Life and Love? Maisie assented to the
25339,CHAPTER VI,new programme of schooling so adorably that Dick could hardly restrain
25340,CHAPTER VI,himself from picking her up then and there and carrying her off to the
25341,CHAPTER VI,nearest registrar's office. It was the implicit obedience to the spoken
25342,CHAPTER VI,word and the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and
25343,CHAPTER VI,"buffeted his soul. He held authority in that house,--authority limited,"
25344,CHAPTER VI,"indeed, to one-half of one afternoon in seven, but very real while it"
25345,CHAPTER VI,"lasted. Maisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects, from the"
25346,CHAPTER VI,proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney. The
25347,CHAPTER VI,red-haired girl never consulted him about anything.
25348,CHAPTER VI,
25349,CHAPTER VI,"On the other hand, she accepted his appearances without protest, and"
25350,CHAPTER VI,watched him always. He discovered that the meals of the establishment
25351,CHAPTER VI,"were irregular and fragmentary. They depended chiefly on tea, pickles,"
25352,CHAPTER VI,"and biscuit, as he had suspected from the beginning. The girls were"
25353,CHAPTER VI,"supposed to market week and week about, but they lived, with the help of"
25354,CHAPTER VI,"a charwoman, as casually as the young ravens. Maisie spent most of her"
25355,CHAPTER VI,"income on models, and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined"
25356,CHAPTER VI,"as her work was rough. Armed with knowledge, dear-bought from the Docks,"
25357,CHAPTER VI,Dick warned Maisie that the end of semi-starvation meant the crippling
25358,CHAPTER VI,"of power to work, which was considerably worse than death."
25359,CHAPTER VI,
25360,CHAPTER VI,"Maisie took the warning, and gave more thought to what she ate and"
25361,CHAPTER VI,"drank. When his trouble returned upon him, as it generally did in the"
25362,CHAPTER VI,"long winter twilights, the remembrance of that little act of domestic"
25363,CHAPTER VI,authority and his coercion with a hearth-brush of the smoky drawing-room
25364,CHAPTER VI,chimney stung Dick like a whip-lash.
25365,CHAPTER VI,
25366,CHAPTER VI,"He conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings,"
25367,CHAPTER VI,"till one Sunday, the red-haired girl announced that she would make a"
25368,CHAPTER VI,"study of Dick's head, and that he would be good enough to sit still,"
25369,CHAPTER VI,"and--quite as an afterthought--look at Maisie. He sat, because he could"
25370,CHAPTER VI,"not well refuse, and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all"
25371,CHAPTER VI,the people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his
25372,CHAPTER VI,"own craft. He remembered Binat most distinctly,--that Binat who had once"
25373,CHAPTER VI,been an artist and talked about degradation.
25374,CHAPTER VI,
25375,CHAPTER VI,"It was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head, but it presented the"
25376,CHAPTER VI,"dumb waiting, the longing, and, above all, the hopeless enslavement of"
25377,CHAPTER VI,"the man, in a spirit of bitter mockery."
25378,CHAPTER VI,
25379,CHAPTER VI,"""I'll buy it,"" said Dick, promptly, ""at your own price."""
25380,CHAPTER VI,
25381,CHAPTER VI,"""My price is too high, but I dare say you'll be as grateful if----"" The"
25382,CHAPTER VI,"wet sketch, fluttered from the girl's hand and fell into the ashes of"
25383,CHAPTER VI,the studio stove. When she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged.
25384,CHAPTER VI,
25385,CHAPTER VI,"""Oh, it's all spoiled!"" said Maisie. ""And I never saw it. Was it like?"""
25386,CHAPTER VI,
25387,CHAPTER VI,"""Thank you,"" said Dick under his breath to the red-haired girl, and he"
25388,CHAPTER VI,removed himself swiftly.
25389,CHAPTER VI,
25390,CHAPTER VI,"""How that man hates me!"" said the girl. ""And how he loves you, Maisie!"""
25391,CHAPTER VI,
25392,CHAPTER VI,"""What nonsense? I knew Dick's very fond of me, but he had his work to"
25393,CHAPTER VI,"do, and I have mine."""
25394,CHAPTER VI,
25395,CHAPTER VI,"""Yes, he is fond of you, and I think he knows there is something in"
25396,CHAPTER VI,"impressionism, after all. Maisie, can't you see?"""
25397,CHAPTER VI,
25398,CHAPTER VI,"""See? See what?"""
25399,CHAPTER VI,
25400,CHAPTER VI,"""Nothing; only, I know that if I could get any man to look at me as that"
25401,CHAPTER VI,"man looks at you, I'd--I don't know what I'd do. But he hates me. Oh,"
25402,CHAPTER VI,"how he hates me!"""
25403,CHAPTER VI,
25404,CHAPTER VI,She was not altogether correct. Dick's hatred was tempered with
25405,CHAPTER VI,"gratitude for a few moments, and then he forgot the girl entirely. Only"
25406,CHAPTER VI,"the sense of shame remained, and he was nursing it across the Park"
25407,CHAPTER VI,"in the fog. ""There'll be an explosion one of these days,"" he said"
25408,CHAPTER VI,"wrathfully. ""But it isn't Maisie's fault; she's right, quite right, as"
25409,CHAPTER VI,"far as she knows, and I can't blame her. This business has been going"
25410,CHAPTER VI,"on for three months nearly. Three months!--and it cost me ten years"""
25411,CHAPTER VI,"knocking about to get at the notion, the merest raw notion, of my"
25412,CHAPTER VI,"work. That's true; but then I didn't have pins, drawing-pins, and"
25413,CHAPTER VI,"palette-knives, stuck into me every Sunday."
25414,CHAPTER VI,
25415,CHAPTER VI,"""Oh, my little darling, if ever I break you, somebody will have a very"
25416,CHAPTER VI,"bad time of it. No, she won't. I'd be as big a fool about her as I"
25417,CHAPTER VI,"am now. I'll poison that red-haired girl on my wedding-day,--she's"
25418,CHAPTER VI,"unwholesome,--and now I'll pass on these present bad times to Torp."""
25419,CHAPTER VI,
25420,CHAPTER VI,Torpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the
25421,CHAPTER VI,"sin of levity, and Dick and listened and replied not a word. In the"
25422,CHAPTER VI,weeks between the first few Sundays of his discipline he had flung
25423,CHAPTER VI,"himself savagely into his work, resolved that Maisie should at least"
25424,CHAPTER VI,know the full stretch of his powers. Then he had taught Maisie that she
25425,CHAPTER VI,"must not pay the least attention to any work outside her own, and"
25426,CHAPTER VI,"Maisie had obeyed him all too well. She took his counsels, but was not"
25427,CHAPTER VI,interested in his pictures.
25428,CHAPTER VI,
25429,CHAPTER VI,"""Your things smell of tobacco and blood,"" she said once. ""Can't you do"
25430,CHAPTER VI,"anything except soldiers?"""
25431,CHAPTER VI,
25432,CHAPTER VI,"""I could do a head of you that would startle you,"" thought"
25433,CHAPTER VI,"Dick,--this was before the red-haired girl had brought him under"
25434,CHAPTER VI,"the guillotine,--but he only said, ""I am very sorry,"" and harrowed"
25435,CHAPTER VI,"Torpenhow's soul that evening with blasphemies against Art. Later,"
25436,CHAPTER VI,"insensibly and to a large extent against his own will, he ceased to"
25437,CHAPTER VI,interest himself in his own work.
25438,CHAPTER VI,
25439,CHAPTER VI,"For Maisie's sake, and to soothe the self-respect that it seemed to him"
25440,CHAPTER VI,"he lost each Sunday, he would not consciously turn out bad stuff, but,"
25441,CHAPTER VI,"since Maisie did not care even for his best, it were better not to"
25442,CHAPTER VI,do anything at all save wait and mark time between Sunday and Sunday.
25443,CHAPTER VI,"Torpenhow was disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless, and then"
25444,CHAPTER VI,attacked him one Sunday evening when Dick felt utterly exhausted after
25445,CHAPTER VI,three hours' biting self-restraint in Maisie's presence. There was
25446,CHAPTER VI,"Language, and Torpenhow withdrew to consult the Nilghai, who had come it"
25447,CHAPTER VI,to talk continental politics.
25448,CHAPTER VI,
25449,CHAPTER VI,"""Bone-idle, is he? Careless, and touched in the temper?"" said the"
25450,CHAPTER VI,"Nilghai. ""It isn't worth worrying over. Dick is probably playing the"
25451,CHAPTER VI,"fool with a woman."""
25452,CHAPTER VI,
25453,CHAPTER VI,"""Isn't that bad enough?"""
25454,CHAPTER VI,
25455,CHAPTER VI,"""No. She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for"
25456,CHAPTER VI,a while. She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the

25512,CHAPTER VI,
25513,CHAPTER VI,Torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to

25530,CHAPTER VI,
25531,CHAPTER VI,Dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning. In the night-watches
25532,CHAPTER VI,"he was overtaken with an idea, so simple and so luminous that he"
25533,CHAPTER VI,wondered he had never conceived it before. It was full of craft. He
25534,CHAPTER VI,"would seek Maisie on a week-day,--would suggest an excursion, and would"
25535,CHAPTER VI,"take her by train to Fort Keeling, over the very ground that they two"
25536,CHAPTER VI,had trodden together ten years ago.
25537,CHAPTER VI,
25538,CHAPTER VI,"""As a general rule,"" he explained to his chin-lathered reflection in the"

25542,CHAPTER VI,
25543,CHAPTER VI,"Fortunately, the red-haired girl was out shopping when he arrived, and"
25544,CHAPTER VI,Maisie in a paint-spattered blouse was warring with her canvas. She was
25545,CHAPTER VI,not pleased to see him; for week-day visits were a stretch of the bond;
25546,CHAPTER VI,and it needed all his courage to explain his errand.
25547,CHAPTER VI,
25548,CHAPTER VI,"""I know you've been working too hard,"" he concluded, with an air of"

25551,CHAPTER VI,
25552,CHAPTER VI,"""Where?"" said Maisie, wearily. She had been standing before her easel"

25554,CHAPTER VI,
25555,CHAPTER VI,"""Anywhere you please. We'll take a train tomorrow and see where it"

25558,CHAPTER VI,
25559,CHAPTER VI,"""If there's a good working light tomorrow, I lose a day."" Maisie"
25560,CHAPTER VI,balanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely.
25561,CHAPTER VI,
25562,CHAPTER VI,Dick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips. He had not yet

25564,CHAPTER VI,
25565,CHAPTER VI,"""You'll lose ever so many more, dear, if you use every hour of working"

25574,CHAPTER VI,
25575,CHAPTER VI,"Dick went away delighted, and by consequence did no work whatever."
25576,CHAPTER VI,
25577,CHAPTER VI,"He strangled a wild desire to order a special train, but bought a great"
25578,CHAPTER VI,"gray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten, and then retired"
25579,CHAPTER VI,into himself to consider things.
25580,CHAPTER VI,
25581,CHAPTER VI,"""I'm going out for the day tomorrow with Dick,"" said Maisie to the"
25582,CHAPTER VI,"red-haired girl when the latter returned, tired, from marketing in the"

25587,CHAPTER VI,
25588,CHAPTER VI,Maisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to

25590,CHAPTER VI,
25591,CHAPTER VI,"""There's nobody nicer than Dick when he talks sensibly,"" she thought,"
25592,CHAPTER VI,"""but I'm sure he'll be silly and worry me, and I'm sure I can't tell him"

25594,CHAPTER VI,"so much better."""
25595,CHAPTER VI,
25596,CHAPTER VI,Dick's eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning
25597,CHAPTER VI,"and saw Maisie, gray-ulstered and black-velvet-hatted, standing in the"
25598,CHAPTER VI,"hallway. Palaces of marble, and not sordid imitation of grained wood,"
25599,CHAPTER VI,were surely the fittest background for such a divinity. The red-haired
25600,CHAPTER VI,girl drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly.
25601,CHAPTER VI,
25602,CHAPTER VI,Maisie's eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead; she was altogether
25603,CHAPTER VI,"unused to these demonstrations. ""Mind my hat,"" she said, hurrying away,"
25604,CHAPTER VI,and ran down the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom.
25605,CHAPTER VI,
25606,CHAPTER VI,"""Are you quite warm enough! Are you sure you wouldn't like some more"

25608,CHAPTER VI,
25609,CHAPTER VI,"""I'm quite comf'y, thanks. Where are we going, Dick? Oh, do stop singing"

25615,CHAPTER VI,
25616,CHAPTER VI,Maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply. The wind of a
25617,CHAPTER VI,"keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks. Overhead,"
25618,CHAPTER VI,the creamy-yellow smoke-clouds were thinning away one by one against a
25619,CHAPTER VI,"pale-blue sky, and the improvident sparrows broke off from water-spout"
25620,CHAPTER VI,committees and cab-rank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring.
25621,CHAPTER VI,
25622,CHAPTER VI,"""It will be lovely weather in the country,"" said Dick."
25623,CHAPTER VI,
25624,CHAPTER VI,"""But where are we going?"""
25625,CHAPTER VI,
25626,CHAPTER VI,"""Wait and see."""
25627,CHAPTER VI,
25628,CHAPTER VI,"The stopped at Victoria, and Dick sought tickets. For less than half the"

25630,CHAPTER VI,"waiting-room fire, that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the"
25631,CHAPTER VI,booking-office than to elbow one's own way through the crowd. Dick put
25632,CHAPTER VI,"her into a Pullman,--solely on account of the warmth there; and she"
25633,CHAPTER VI,regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved
25634,CHAPTER VI,out into the country.
25635,CHAPTER VI,
25636,CHAPTER VI,"""I wish I knew where we are going,"" she repeated for the twentieth time."
25637,CHAPTER VI,
25638,CHAPTER VI,"The name of a well-remembered station flashed by, towards the end of the"
25639,CHAPTER VI,"run, and Maisie was delighted."
25640,CHAPTER VI,
25641,CHAPTER VI,"""Oh, Dick, you villain!"""
25642,CHAPTER VI,
25643,CHAPTER VI,"""Well, I thought you might like to see the place again. You haven't been"

25658,CHAPTER VI,
25659,CHAPTER VI,"They laughed and leaned to look out, identifying ancient landmarks with"
25660,CHAPTER VI,many reminiscences. Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisie's
25661,CHAPTER VI,"cheek, very near his own, and watched the blood rise under the clear"
25662,CHAPTER VI,"skin. He congratulated himself upon his cunning, and looked that the"
25663,CHAPTER VI,evening would bring him a great reward.
25664,CHAPTER VI,
25665,CHAPTER VI,When the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new
25666,CHAPTER VI,"eyes. First, but from a distance, they regarded the house of Mrs."
25667,CHAPTER VI,Jennett.
25668,CHAPTER VI,
25669,CHAPTER VI,"""Suppose she should come out now, what would you do?"" said Dick, with"

25675,CHAPTER VI,
25676,CHAPTER VI,"Maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa, and"
25677,CHAPTER VI,Dick laughed.

25680,CHAPTER VI,"""'Maisie, you run in at once, and learn the collect, gospel, and epistle"

25684,CHAPTER VI,
25685,CHAPTER VI,The sentence ended abruptly. Maisie remembered when it had last been

25687,CHAPTER VI,
25688,CHAPTER VI,"""'Try to behave like one,'"" said Dick, promptly. ""Quite right. Now we'll"

25694,CHAPTER VI,
25695,CHAPTER VI,"They turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets,"

25698,CHAPTER VI,pocket-money amounted to a shilling a week.
25699,CHAPTER VI,
25700,CHAPTER VI,"""Dick, have you any pennies?"" said Maisie, half to herself."

25702,CHAPTER VI,"""Only three; and if you think you're going to have two of 'em to buy"

25704,CHAPTER VI,
25705,CHAPTER VI,"Again they laughed, and again the colour came into Maisie's cheeks as"
25706,CHAPTER VI,the blood boiled through Dick's heart. After a large lunch they went
25707,CHAPTER VI,"down to the beach and to Fort Keeling across the waste, wind-bitten land"
25708,CHAPTER VI,that no builder had thought it worth his while to defile. The winter

26558,CHAPTER VII,
26559,CHAPTER VII,Dick made his prayer to Fate disjointedly after the manner of the
26560,CHAPTER VII,heathen as he threw the piece of silver into the river. If any evil were
26561,CHAPTER VII,"to befal, let him bear the burden and let Maisie go unscathed, since"
26562,CHAPTER VII,the threepenny piece was dearest to him of all his possessions. It was
26563,CHAPTER VII,"a small coin in itself, but Maisie had given it, and the Thames held it,"

26566,CHAPTER VII,The drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie
26567,CHAPTER VII,for the moment. He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his

26569,CHAPTER VII,first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman.
26570,CHAPTER VII,There was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an

27589,CHAPTER IX,"she showed them next week. The Sundays were racing past, and the time"
27590,CHAPTER IX,was at hand when all the church bells in London could not ring

27596,CHAPTER IX,Dick was permitted to see the girls off. They were going by the Dover
27597,CHAPTER IX,"night-boat; and they hoped to return in August. It was then February,"
27598,CHAPTER IX,and Dick felt that he was being hardly used. Maisie was so busy
27599,CHAPTER IX,"stripping the small house across the Park, and packing her canvases,"
27600,CHAPTER IX,that she had not time for thought. Dick went down to Dover and wasted
27601,CHAPTER IX,a day there fretting over a wonderful possibility. Would Maisie at the
27602,CHAPTER IX,very last allow him one small kiss? He reflected that he might capture
27603,CHAPTER IX,"her by the strong arm, as he had seem women captured in the Southern"
27604,CHAPTER IX,"Soudan, and lead her away; but Maisie would never be led. She would turn"
27605,CHAPTER IX,"her gray eyes upon him and say, ""Dick, how selfish you are!"" Then his"
27606,CHAPTER IX,"courage would fail him. It would be better, after all, to beg for that"

27611,CHAPTER IX,cloth travelling-cap. The red-haired girl was not so lovely. Her green
27612,CHAPTER IX,"eyes were hollow and her lips were dry. Dick saw the trunks aboard, and"
27613,CHAPTER IX,went to Maisie's side in the darkness under the bridge. The mail-bags
27614,CHAPTER IX,"were thundering into the forehold, and the red-haired girl was watching"

27649,CHAPTER IX,abashed and tingling from head to toe.
27650,CHAPTER IX,
27651,CHAPTER IX,"""Goodbye, darling. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. Only--keep"

27659,CHAPTER IX,A shout told him that it was not seemly to charge of the mail-bag

27666,CHAPTER IX,
27667,CHAPTER IX,Maisie stood where Dick had left her till she heard a little gasping

27920,CHAPTER IX,"""I was a great fool,"" Dick said to himself. ""I know what red firelight"
27921,CHAPTER IX,looks like when a man's tramping through a strange town; and ours is a
27922,CHAPTER IX,"lonely, selfish sort of life at the best. I wonder Maisie doesn't feel"
27923,CHAPTER IX,that sometimes. But I can't order Bessie away. That's the worst of

27925,CHAPTER IX,
27926,CHAPTER IX,"One evening, after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light,"
27927,CHAPTER IX,Dick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in Torpenhow's room. He
27928,CHAPTER IX,"jumped to his feet. ""Now what ought I to do? It looks foolish to go"
27929,CHAPTER IX,"in.--Oh, bless you, Binkie!"" The little terrier thrust Torpenhow's door"
27930,CHAPTER IX,open with his nose and came out to take possession of Dick's chair. The
27931,CHAPTER IX,"door swung wide unheeded, and Dick across the landing could see Bessie"
27932,CHAPTER IX,in the half-light making her little supplication to Torpenhow. She was
27933,CHAPTER IX,"kneeling by his side, and her hands were clasped across his knee."
27934,CHAPTER IX,
27935,CHAPTER IX,"""I know,--I know,"" she said thickly. ""'Tisn't right 'o me to do this,"
27936,CHAPTER IX,"but I can't help it; and you were so kind,--so kind; and you never took"
27937,CHAPTER IX,"any notice 'o me. And I've mended all your things so carefully,--I did."
27938,CHAPTER IX,"Oh, please, 'tisn't as if I was asking you to marry me. I wouldn't think"
27939,CHAPTER IX,of it. But you--couldn't you take and live with me till Miss Right comes
27940,CHAPTER IX,"along? I'm only Miss Wrong, I know, but I'd work my hands to the bare"

27942,CHAPTER IX,
27943,CHAPTER IX,"Dick hardly recognised Torpenhow's voice in reply--""But look here. It's"

27946,CHAPTER IX,

27956,CHAPTER IX,
27957,CHAPTER IX,"""Heaven send he'll listen to me!"" There was something very like an oath"
27958,CHAPTER IX,"from Bessie's lips. She was afraid of Dick, and disappeared down the"
27959,CHAPTER IX,"staircase in panic, but it seemed an age before Torpenhow entered the"
27960,CHAPTER IX,"studio. He went to the mantelpiece, buried his head on his arms, and"
27961,CHAPTER IX,groaned like a wounded bull.

28108,CHAPTER X,"scar of the sword-cut on Dick's head, and Dick explained briefly how he"

28176,CHAPTER X,A soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broad-bladed Arab spear.
28177,CHAPTER X,"For one instant the man felt no pain. Looking down, he saw that his"

28180,CHAPTER X,"unstrung from a fight for life, had roared with laughter, in which the"
28181,CHAPTER X,"man seemed as if he would join, but, as his lips parted in a sheepish"
28182,CHAPTER X,"grin, the agony of death came upon him, and he pitched grunting at their"
28183,CHAPTER X,"feet. Dick laughed again, remembering the horror. It seemed so exactly"
28184,CHAPTER X,like his own case.
28185,CHAPTER X,
28186,CHAPTER X,"""But I have a little more time allowed me,"" he said. He paced up and"
28187,CHAPTER X,"down the room, quietly at first, but afterwards with the hurried feet of"
28188,CHAPTER X,fear. It was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him
28189,CHAPTER X,to go forward; and there were only weaving circles and floating pin-dots
28190,CHAPTER X,before his eyes.
28191,CHAPTER X,
28192,CHAPTER X,"""We need to be calm, Binkie; we must be calm."" He talked aloud for the"

28221,CHAPTER X,"their steadiness; he could feel that his lips were quivering, and the"
28222,CHAPTER X,"sweat was running down his face. He was lashed by fear, driven forward"
28223,CHAPTER X,"by the desire to get to work at once and accomplish something, and"
28224,CHAPTER X,maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news
28225,CHAPTER X,"that he was about to go blind. ""It's a humiliating exhibition,"" he"
28226,CHAPTER X,"thought, ""and I'm glad Torp isn't here to see. The doctor said I was to"

28257,CHAPTER X,"very little about his own, and dreamed of the Melancolia to be born. Not"
28258,CHAPTER X,till morning did he remember that something might happen to him in the
28259,CHAPTER X,future.
28260,CHAPTER X,
28261,CHAPTER X,"He fell to work, whistling softly, and was swallowed up in the clean,"
28262,CHAPTER X,"clear joy of creation, which does not come to man too often, lest he"
28263,CHAPTER X,"should consider himself the equal of his God, and so refuse to die at"
28264,CHAPTER X,"the appointed time. He forgot Maisie, Torpenhow, and Binkie at his feet,"
28265,CHAPTER X,"but remembered to stir Bessie, who needed very little stirring, into a"
28266,CHAPTER X,"tremendous rage, that he might watch the smouldering lights in her eyes."
28267,CHAPTER X,
28268,CHAPTER X,"He threw himself without reservation into his work, and did not think of"
28269,CHAPTER X,"the doom that was to overtake him, for he was possessed with his notion,"
28270,CHAPTER X,and the things of this world had no power upon him.
28271,CHAPTER X,
28272,CHAPTER X,"""You're pleased today,"" said Bessie."
28273,CHAPTER X,
28274,CHAPTER X,Dick waved his mahl-stick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard
28275,CHAPTER X,"for a drink. In the evening, when the exaltation of the day had died"
28276,CHAPTER X,"down, he went to the sideboard again, and after some visits became"
28277,CHAPTER X,"convinced that the eye-doctor was a liar, since he could still see"
28278,CHAPTER X,everything very clearly.
28279,CHAPTER X,
28280,CHAPTER X,"He was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie, and that"
28281,CHAPTER X,whether she liked it or not she should be his wife. The mood passed next
28282,CHAPTER X,"morning, but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort."
28283,CHAPTER X,
28284,CHAPTER X,"Again he set to work, and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes"
28285,CHAPTER X,"and blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard, and the"
28286,CHAPTER X,Melancolia both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than
28287,CHAPTER X,"ever. There was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him, such"
28288,CHAPTER X,as they feel who walking among their fellow-men know that the
28289,CHAPTER X,"death-sentence of disease is upon them, and, seeing that fear is but"
28290,CHAPTER X,"waste of the little time left, are riotously happy. The days passed"
28291,CHAPTER X,without event.
28292,CHAPTER X,
28293,CHAPTER X,"Bessie arrived punctually always, and, though her voice seemed to Dick"
28294,CHAPTER X,"to come from a distance, her face was always very near. The Melancolia"
28295,CHAPTER X,"began to flame on the canvas, in the likeness of a woman who had known"
28296,CHAPTER X,all the sorrow in the world and was laughing at it. It was true that the
28297,CHAPTER X,corners of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired into
28298,CHAPTER X,"the darkness, that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his head"
28299,CHAPTER X,"were very troublesome, and that Maisie's letters were hard to read and"
28300,CHAPTER X,"harder still to answer. He could not tell her of his trouble, and he"
28301,CHAPTER X,could not laugh at her accounts of her own Melancolia which was always
28302,CHAPTER X,going to be finished. But the furious days of toil and the nights of
28303,CHAPTER X,"wild dreams made amends for all, and the sideboard was his best friend"
28304,CHAPTER X,on earth.
28305,CHAPTER X,
28306,CHAPTER X,Bessie was singularly dull. She used to shriek with rage when Dick
28307,CHAPTER X,"stared at her between half-closed eyes. Now she sulked, or watched him"
28308,CHAPTER X,"with disgust, saying very little."
28309,CHAPTER X,
28310,CHAPTER X,Torpenhow had been absent for six weeks. An incoherent note heralded his
28311,CHAPTER X,"return. ""News! great news!"" he wrote. ""The Nilghai knows, and so"
28312,CHAPTER X,does the Keneu. We're all back on Thursday. Get lunch and clean your
28313,CHAPTER X,"accoutrements."""
28314,CHAPTER X,
28315,CHAPTER X,"Dick showed Bessie the letter, and she abused him for that he had ever"
28316,CHAPTER X,sent Torpenhow away and ruined her life.
28317,CHAPTER X,
28318,CHAPTER X,"""Well,"" said Dick, brutally, ""you're better as you are, instead of"
28319,CHAPTER X,"making love to some drunken beast in the street."" He felt that he had"
28320,CHAPTER X,rescued Torpenhow from great temptation.
28321,CHAPTER X,
28322,CHAPTER X,"""I don't know if that's any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a"
28323,CHAPTER X,studio. You haven't been sober for three weeks. You've been soaking the
28324,CHAPTER X,"whole time; and yet you pretend you're better than me!"""
28325,CHAPTER X,
28326,CHAPTER X,"""What d'you mean?"" said Dick."
28327,CHAPTER X,
28328,CHAPTER X,"""Mean! You'll see when Mr. Torpenhow comes back."""
28329,CHAPTER X,
28330,CHAPTER X,It was not long to wait. Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without a
28331,CHAPTER X,"sign of feeling. He had news that was more to him than many Bessies, and"
28332,CHAPTER X,"the Keneu and the Nilghai were trampling behind him, calling for Dick."
28333,CHAPTER X,
28334,CHAPTER X,"""Drinking like a fish,"" Bessie whispered. ""He's been at it for nearly a"
28335,CHAPTER X,"month."" She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done."
28336,CHAPTER X,
28337,CHAPTER X,"They came into the studio, rejoicing, to be welcomed over effusively by"
28338,CHAPTER X,"a drawn, lined, shrunken, haggard wreck,--unshaven, blue-white about"
28339,CHAPTER X,"the nostrils, stooping in the shoulders, and peering under his eyebrows"
28340,CHAPTER X,nervously. The drink had been at work as steadily as Dick.
28341,CHAPTER X,
28342,CHAPTER X,"""Is this you?"" said Torpenhow."
28343,CHAPTER X,
28344,CHAPTER X,"""All that's left of me. Sit down. Binkie's quite well, and I've been"
28345,CHAPTER X,"doing some good work."" He reeled where he stood."
28346,CHAPTER X,
28347,CHAPTER X,"""You've done some of the worst work you've ever done in your life. Man"
28348,CHAPTER X,"alive, you're----"""
28349,CHAPTER X,
28350,CHAPTER X,"Torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly, and they left the room"
28351,CHAPTER X,"to find lunch elsewhere. Then he spoke; but, since the reproof of a"
28352,CHAPTER X,"friend is much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed, and since"
28353,CHAPTER X,"Torpenhow used figures and metaphors which were unseemly, and contempt"
28354,CHAPTER X,"untranslatable, it will never be known what was actually said to Dick,"
28355,CHAPTER X,who blinked and winked and picked at his hands. After a time the culprit
28356,CHAPTER X,began to feel the need of a little self-respect. He was quite sure that
28357,CHAPTER X,"he had not in any way departed from virtue, and there were reasons, too,"
28358,CHAPTER X,of which Torpenhow knew nothing. He would explain.
28359,CHAPTER X,
28360,CHAPTER X,"He rose, tried to straighten his shoulders, and spoke to the face he"
28361,CHAPTER X,could hardly see.
28362,CHAPTER X,
28363,CHAPTER X,"""You are right,"" he said. ""But I am right, too. After you went away I"
28364,CHAPTER X,"had some trouble with my eyes. So I went to an oculist, and he turned a"
28365,CHAPTER X,gasogene--I mean a gas-engine--into my eye. That was very long ago. He
28366,CHAPTER X,"said, 'Scar on the head,--sword-cut and optic nerve.' Make a note of"
28367,CHAPTER X,"that. So I am going blind. I have some work to do before I go blind, and"
28368,CHAPTER X,"I suppose that I must do it. I cannot see much now, but I can see best"
28369,CHAPTER X,"when I am drunk. I did not know I was drunk till I was told, but I must"
28370,CHAPTER X,"go on with my work. If you want to see it, there it is."" He pointed to"
28371,CHAPTER X,the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause.
28372,CHAPTER X,
28373,CHAPTER X,"Torpenhow said nothing, and Dick began to whimper feebly, for joy at"
28374,CHAPTER X,"seeing Torpenhow again, for grief at misdeeds--if indeed they were"
28375,CHAPTER X,"misdeeds--that made Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic, and for childish"
28376,CHAPTER X,"vanity hurt, since Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his"
28377,CHAPTER X,wonderful picture.
28378,CHAPTER X,
28379,CHAPTER X,"Bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause, and saw the two"
28380,CHAPTER X,"walking up and down as usual, Torpenhow's hand on Dick's shoulder."
28381,CHAPTER X,
28382,CHAPTER X,"Hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie,"
28383,CHAPTER X,who was dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his
28384,CHAPTER X,master again.

28413,CHAPTER XI,work. Don't keep me back any more. I don't know when my eyes may give
28414,CHAPTER XI,out. The spots and dots and the pains and things are crowding worse than
28415,CHAPTER XI,"ever. I swear I can see all right when I'm--when I'm moderately screwed,"
28416,CHAPTER XI,as you say. Give me three more sittings from Bessie and all--the stuff

28422,CHAPTER XI,
28423,CHAPTER XI,"""I can't. You don't know what that picture means to me. But surely you"
28424,CHAPTER XI,"could get the Nilghai to help you, and knock me down and tie me up. I"

28430,CHAPTER XI,"Dick returned to his work, toiling as one possessed; and the yellow"

28436,CHAPTER XI,"""You can't understand, Bess. We are in sight of land now, and soon we"

28541,CHAPTER XI,"bottle of turpentine on a duster, and began to scrub the face of the"

28548,CHAPTER XI,at least done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire
28549,CHAPTER XI,and who used to make fun of her. Cashing the check was the very cream of

28597,CHAPTER XI,"""What's the matter?"""
28598,CHAPTER XI,
28599,CHAPTER XI,"Dick clutched at his shoulder. ""Matter! I've been lying here for hours"

28602,CHAPTER XI,
28603,CHAPTER XI,"Torpenhow held the candle within a foot of Dick's eyes, but there was no"
28604,CHAPTER XI,"light in those eyes. He lit the gas, and Dick heard the flame catch. The"
28605,CHAPTER XI,grip of his fingers on Torpenhow's shoulder made Torpenhow wince.
28606,CHAPTER XI,
28607,CHAPTER XI,"""Don't leave me. You wouldn't leave me alone now, would you? I can't"
28608,CHAPTER XI,"see. D'you understand? It's black,--quite black,--and I feel as if I was"
28609,CHAPTER XI,"falling through it all."""
28610,CHAPTER XI,
28611,CHAPTER XI,"""Steady does it."" Torpenhow put his arm round Dick and began to rock him"
28612,CHAPTER XI,gently to and fro.
28613,CHAPTER XI,
28614,CHAPTER XI,"""That's good. Now don't talk. If I keep very quiet for a while, this"
28615,CHAPTER XI,"darkness will lift. It seems just on the point of breaking. H'sh!"" Dick"
28616,CHAPTER XI,knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him. The night air was
28617,CHAPTER XI,chilling Torpenhow's toes.
28618,CHAPTER XI,
28619,CHAPTER XI,"""Can you stay like that a minute?"" he said. ""I'll get my dressing-gown"
28620,CHAPTER XI,"and some slippers."""
28621,CHAPTER XI,
28622,CHAPTER XI,Dick clutched the bed-head with both hands and waited for the darkness
28623,CHAPTER XI,"to clear away. ""What a time you've been!"" he cried, when Torpenhow"
28624,CHAPTER XI,"returned. ""It's as black as ever. What are you banging about in the"

28626,CHAPTER XI,

28630,CHAPTER XI,"""I shan't!"" The voice rose to a wail. ""My God! I'm blind! I'm blind, and"
28631,CHAPTER XI,"the darkness will never go away."" He made as if to leap from the bed,"
28632,CHAPTER XI,"but Torpenhow's arms were round him, and Torpenhow's chin was on his"

28635,CHAPTER XI,
28636,CHAPTER XI,"""Steady, Dickie, steady!"" said the deep voice in his ear, and the grip"
28637,CHAPTER XI,"tightened. ""Bite on the bullet, old man, and don't let them think you're"
28638,CHAPTER XI,"afraid."" The grip could draw no closer. Both men were breathing heavily."
28639,CHAPTER XI,
28640,CHAPTER XI,Dick threw his head from side to side and groaned.
28641,CHAPTER XI,
28642,CHAPTER XI,"""Let me go,"" he panted. ""You're cracking my ribs. We--we mustn't let"

28645,CHAPTER XI,

28650,CHAPTER XI,"the dark so."""
28651,CHAPTER XI,
28652,CHAPTER XI,Torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair. Dick
28653,CHAPTER XI,"clutched it tightly, and in half an hour had fallen asleep. Torpenhow"
28654,CHAPTER XI,"withdrew his hand, and, stooping over Dick, kissed him lightly on the"
28655,CHAPTER XI,"forehead, as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of"
28656,CHAPTER XI,"death, to ease his departure."
28657,CHAPTER XI,
28658,CHAPTER XI,In the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself. He was adrift
28659,CHAPTER XI,"on the shoreless tides of delirium, speaking very quickly--""It's a"
28660,CHAPTER XI,"pity,--a great pity; but it's helped, and it must be eaten, Master"

28662,CHAPTER XI,"putting aside all Melancolias and false humours, it is of obvious"
28663,CHAPTER XI,notoriety--such as mine was--that the queen can do no wrong. Torp
28664,CHAPTER XI,doesn't know that. I'll tell him when we're a little farther into the

28670,CHAPTER XI,"round. How good that looks! I'll sketch it. No, I can't. I'm afflicted"
28671,CHAPTER XI,"with ophthalmia. That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt, and it"
28672,CHAPTER XI,"extends up the Nile in the shape of cataract. Ha! that's a joke, Torp."
28673,CHAPTER XI,"Laugh, you graven image, and stand clear of the hawser.... It'll"
28674,CHAPTER XI,"knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty, Maisie dear."""
28675,CHAPTER XI,
28676,CHAPTER XI,"""Oh!"" said Torpenhow. ""This happened before. That night on the river."""

28683,CHAPTER XI,
28684,CHAPTER XI,"""Now we mustn't listen. Here's an island shouting across seas of"

28686,CHAPTER XI,said Torpenhow.
28687,CHAPTER XI,
28688,CHAPTER XI,The babble continued. It all bore upon Maisie. Sometimes Dick lectured
28689,CHAPTER XI,"at length on his craft, then he cursed himself for his folly in being"
28690,CHAPTER XI,enslaved. He pleaded to Maisie for a kiss--only one kiss--before she
28691,CHAPTER XI,"went away, and called to her to come back from Vitry-sur-Marne, if she"
28692,CHAPTER XI,would; but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that
28693,CHAPTER XI,the queen could do no wrong.
28694,CHAPTER XI,
28695,CHAPTER XI,"Torpenhow listened attentively, and learned every detail of Dick's life"
28696,CHAPTER XI,that had been hidden from him. For three days Dick raved through the
28697,CHAPTER XI,"past, and then a natural sleep. ""What a strain he has been running"
28698,CHAPTER XI,"under, poor chap!"" said Torpenhow. ""Dick, of all men, handing himself"
28699,CHAPTER XI,over like a dog! And I was lecturing him on arrogance! I ought to have
28700,CHAPTER XI,known that it was no use to judge a man. But I did it. What a demon that
28701,CHAPTER XI,"girl must be! Dick's given her his life,--confound him!--and she's given"
28702,CHAPTER XI,"him one kiss apparently."""
28703,CHAPTER XI,
28704,CHAPTER XI,"""Torp,"" said Dick, from the bed, ""go out for a walk. You've been here"
28705,CHAPTER XI,"too long. I'll get up. Hi! This is annoying. I can't dress myself. Oh,"
28706,CHAPTER XI,"it's too absurd!"""
28707,CHAPTER XI,
28708,CHAPTER XI,Torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair
28709,CHAPTER XI,in the studio. He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for
28710,CHAPTER XI,"the darkness to lift. It did not lift that day, nor the next. Dick"
28711,CHAPTER XI,adventured on a voyage round the walls. He hit his shins against the
28712,CHAPTER XI,"stove, and this suggested to him that it would be better to crawl on all"
28713,CHAPTER XI,"fours, one hand in front of him. Torpenhow found him on the floor."
28714,CHAPTER XI,
28715,CHAPTER XI,"""I'm trying to get the geography of my new possessions,"" said he. ""D'you"
28716,CHAPTER XI,remember that nigger you gouged in the square? Pity you didn't keep the
28717,CHAPTER XI,odd eye. It would have been useful. Any letters for me? Give me all the
28718,CHAPTER XI,ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside. They're
28719,CHAPTER XI,"of no importance."""
28720,CHAPTER XI,
28721,CHAPTER XI,Torpenhow gave him a letter with a black M. on the envelope flap. Dick
28722,CHAPTER XI,put it into his pocket. There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might
28723,CHAPTER XI,"not have read, but it belonged to himself and to Maisie, who would never"
28724,CHAPTER XI,belong to him.
28725,CHAPTER XI,
28726,CHAPTER XI,"""When she finds that I don't write, she'll stop writing. It's better"
28727,CHAPTER XI,"so. I couldn't be any use to her now,"" Dick argued, and the tempter"
28728,CHAPTER XI,suggested that he should make known his condition. Every nerve in him
28729,CHAPTER XI,"revolted. ""I have fallen low enough already. I'm not going to beg for"
28730,CHAPTER XI,"pity. Besides, it would be cruel to her."" He strove to put Maisie out of"
28731,CHAPTER XI,"his thoughts; but the blind have many opportunities for thinking, and as"
28732,CHAPTER XI,the tides of his strength came back to him in the long employless days
28733,CHAPTER XI,"of dead darkness, Dick's soul was troubled to the core. Another letter,"
28734,CHAPTER XI,"and another, came from Maisie. Then there was silence, and Dick sat by"
28735,CHAPTER XI,"the window, the pulse of summer in the air, and pictured her being won"
28736,CHAPTER XI,"by another man, stronger than himself. His imagination, the keener for"
28737,CHAPTER XI,"the dark background it worked against, spared him no single detail that"
28738,CHAPTER XI,"might send him raging up and down the studio, to stumble over the stove"
28739,CHAPTER XI,"that seemed to be in four places at once. Worst of all, tobacco would"
28740,CHAPTER XI,"not taste in the darkness. The arrogance of the man had disappeared, and"
28741,CHAPTER XI,"in its place were settled despair that Torpenhow knew, and blind passion"
28742,CHAPTER XI,that Dick confided to his pillow at night. The intervals between
28743,CHAPTER XI,the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting and the weight of
28744,CHAPTER XI,intolerable darkness.
28745,CHAPTER XI,
28746,CHAPTER XI,"""Come out into the Park,"" said Torpenhow. ""You haven't stirred out since"
28747,CHAPTER XI,"the beginning of things."""
28748,CHAPTER XI,
28749,CHAPTER XI,"""What's the use? There's no movement in the dark; and, besides,""--he"
28750,CHAPTER XI,"paused irresolutely at the head of the stairs,--""something will run over"
28751,CHAPTER XI,"me."""

28753,CHAPTER XI,"""Not if I'm with you. Proceed gingerly."""
28754,CHAPTER XI,
28755,CHAPTER XI,"The roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror, and he clung to"
28756,CHAPTER XI,"Torpenhow's arm. ""Fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot!"" he"
28757,CHAPTER XI,"said petulantly, as he turned into the Park. ""Let's curse God and die."""
28758,CHAPTER XI,
28759,CHAPTER XI,"""Sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments. By Jove, there"
28760,CHAPTER XI,"are the Guards!"""
28761,CHAPTER XI,
28762,CHAPTER XI,"Dick's figure straightened. ""Let's get near 'em. Let's go in and look."
28763,CHAPTER XI,"Let's get on the grass and run. I can smell the trees."""
28764,CHAPTER XI,
28765,CHAPTER XI,"""Mind the low railing. That's all right!"" Torpenhow kicked out a tuft"
28766,CHAPTER XI,"of grass with his heel. ""Smell that,"" he said. ""Isn't it good?"" Dick"
28767,CHAPTER XI,"sniffed luxuriously. ""Now pick up your feet and run."" They approached"
28768,CHAPTER XI,as near to the regiment as was possible. The clank of bayonets being
28769,CHAPTER XI,unfixed made Dick's nostrils quiver.
28770,CHAPTER XI,
28771,CHAPTER XI,"""Let's get nearer. They're in column, aren't they?"""
28772,CHAPTER XI,
28773,CHAPTER XI,"""Yes. How did you know?"""
28774,CHAPTER XI,
28775,CHAPTER XI,"""Felt it. Oh, my men!--my beautiful men!"" He edged forward as though he"

28783,CHAPTER XI,
28784,CHAPTER XI,"He could hear the armed life almost within reach of him, could hear the"

28791,CHAPTER XI,
28792,CHAPTER XI,"The drum-sticks fell with a boom, and the men swung forward to the crash"

28794,CHAPTER XI,heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the
28795,CHAPTER XI,belts. The big drum pounded out the tune. It was a music-hall refrain
28796,CHAPTER XI,that made a perfect quickstep--
28797,CHAPTER XI,
28798,CHAPTER XI,"""He must be a man of decent height,"

28989,CHAPTER XII,"what he wanted. The darkness would not lift, and Maisie's unopened"
28990,CHAPTER XII,letters felt worn and old from much handling. He could never read them
28991,CHAPTER XII,for himself as long as life endured; but Maisie might have sent him some
28992,CHAPTER XII,"fresh ones to play with. The Nilghai entered with a gift,--a piece of"

29005,CHAPTER XII,"The Nilghai chuckled, and Dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen"

29008,CHAPTER XII,"from him. He was exceedingly sorry for himself, and the completeness"
29009,CHAPTER XII,of his tender grief soothed him. But his soul and his body cried for
29010,CHAPTER XII,"Maisie--Maisie who would understand. His mind pointed out that Maisie,"
29011,CHAPTER XII,"having her own work to do, would not care. His experience had taught him"

29049,CHAPTER XII,
29050,CHAPTER XII,"Dick was led into a chair. He heard the rustle of the maps, and the talk"
29051,CHAPTER XII,"swept forward, carrying him with it. Everybody spoke at once, discussing"
29052,CHAPTER XII,"press censorships, railway-routes, transport, water-supply, the"
29053,CHAPTER XII,"capacities of generals,--these in language that would have horrified a"
29054,CHAPTER XII,"trusting public,--ranting, asserting, denouncing, and laughing at the"
29055,CHAPTER XII,top of their voices. There was the glorious certainty of war in the
29056,CHAPTER XII,"Soudan at any moment. The Nilghai said so, and it was well to be in"
29057,CHAPTER XII,readiness. The Keneu had telegraphed to Cairo for horses; Cassavetti
29058,CHAPTER XII,had stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered
29059,CHAPTER XII,"forward, and was reading it out amid profane interruptions, and the"
29060,CHAPTER XII,Keneu introduced to Dick some man unknown who would be employed as war
29061,CHAPTER XII,"artist by the Central Southern Syndicate. ""It's his first outing,"" said"
29062,CHAPTER XII,"the Keneu. ""Give him some tips--about riding camels."""
29063,CHAPTER XII,
29064,CHAPTER XII,"""Oh, those camels!"" groaned Cassavetti. ""I shall learn to ride him"
29065,CHAPTER XII,"again, and now I am so much all soft! Listen, you good fellows. I know"
29066,CHAPTER XII,your military arrangement very well. There will go the Royal Argalshire
29067,CHAPTER XII,"Sutherlanders. So it was read to me upon best authority."""
29068,CHAPTER XII,
29069,CHAPTER XII,A roar of laughter interrupted him.
29070,CHAPTER XII,
29071,CHAPTER XII,"""Sit down,"" said the Nilghai. ""The lists aren't even made out in the War"
29072,CHAPTER XII,"Office."""
29073,CHAPTER XII,
29074,CHAPTER XII,"""Will there be any force at Suakin?"" said a voice."
29075,CHAPTER XII,
29076,CHAPTER XII,"Then the outcries redoubled, and grew mixed, thus: ""How many Egyptian"
29077,CHAPTER XII,troops will they use?--God help the Fellaheen!--There's a railway
29078,CHAPTER XII,in Plumstead marshes doing duty as a fives-court.--We shall have the

29085,CHAPTER XII,African companies in the South.--There's Guinea-worm in most of the
29086,CHAPTER XII,"wells on that route."" Then the Nilghai, despairing of peace, bellowed"
29087,CHAPTER XII,like a fog-horn and beat upon the table with both hands.
29088,CHAPTER XII,
29089,CHAPTER XII,"""But what becomes of Torpenhow?"" said Dick, in the silence that"
29090,CHAPTER XII,followed.

29092,CHAPTER XII,"""Torp's in abeyance just now. He's off love-making somewhere, I"

29098,CHAPTER XII,if you and the Nilghai hold him down I'll engage to trample on him till
29099,CHAPTER XII,"he sees reason. He'll stay behind, indeed! He's the best of you all."
29100,CHAPTER XII,"There'll be some tough work by Omdurman. We shall come there to stay,"
29101,CHAPTER XII,this time.
29102,CHAPTER XII,
29103,CHAPTER XII,"""But I forgot. I wish I were going with you."""
29104,CHAPTER XII,
29105,CHAPTER XII,"""So do we all, Dickie,"" said the Keneu."
29106,CHAPTER XII,
29107,CHAPTER XII,"""And I most of all,"" said the new artist of the Central Southern"
29108,CHAPTER XII,Syndicate.
29109,CHAPTER XII,
29110,CHAPTER XII,"""Could you tell me----"""
29111,CHAPTER XII,
29112,CHAPTER XII,"""I'll give you one piece of advice,"" Dick answered, moving towards"
29113,CHAPTER XII,"the door. ""If you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage, don't"
29114,CHAPTER XII,guard. Tell the man to go on cutting. You'll find it cheapest in the
29115,CHAPTER XII,"end. Thanks for letting me look in."""
29116,CHAPTER XII,
29117,CHAPTER XII,"""There's grit in Dick,"" said the Nilghai, an hour later, when the room"
29118,CHAPTER XII,was emptied of all save the Keneu.
29119,CHAPTER XII,
29120,CHAPTER XII,"""It was the sacred call of the war-trumpet. Did you notice how he"
29121,CHAPTER XII,"answered to it? Poor fellow! Let's look at him,"" said the Keneu."
29122,CHAPTER XII,
29123,CHAPTER XII,The excitement of the talk had died away. Dick was sitting by the studio
29124,CHAPTER XII,"table, with his head on his arms, when the men came in. He did not"
29125,CHAPTER XII,change his position.
29126,CHAPTER XII,
29127,CHAPTER XII,"""It hurts,"" he moaned. ""God forgive me, but it hurts cruelly; and yet,"
29128,CHAPTER XII,"y'know, the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself. Shall I"
29129,CHAPTER XII,"see Torp before he goes?"""
29130,CHAPTER XII,
29131,CHAPTER XII,"""Oh, yes. You'll see him,"" said the Nilghai."

29133,CHAPTER XII,
29134,CHAPTER XII,
29135,CHAPTER XIII,CHAPTER XIII
29136,CHAPTER XIII,
29137,CHAPTER XIII,"The sun went down an hour ago,"
29138,CHAPTER XIII,I wonder if I face towards home;
29139,CHAPTER XIII,If I lost my way in the light of day
29140,CHAPTER XIII,How shall I find it now night is come?
29141,CHAPTER XIII,--Old Song
29142,CHAPTER XIII,
29143,CHAPTER XIII,"""Maisie, come to bed."""
29144,CHAPTER XIII,
29145,CHAPTER XIII,"""It's so hot I can't sleep. Don't worry."""
29146,CHAPTER XIII,
29147,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie put her elbows on the window-sill and looked at the moonlight on
29148,CHAPTER XIII,"the straight, poplar-flanked road. Summer had come upon Vitry-sur-Marne"
29149,CHAPTER XIII,"and parched it to the bone. The grass was dry-burnt in the meadows, the"
29150,CHAPTER XIII,"clay by the bank of the river was caked to brick, the roadside flowers"
29151,CHAPTER XIII,"were long since dead, and the roses in the garden hung withered on their"
29152,CHAPTER XIII,stalks. The heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was almost
29153,CHAPTER XIII,intolerable. The very moonlight on the wall of Kami's studio across
29154,CHAPTER XIII,"the road seemed to make the night hotter, and the shadow of the big"
29155,CHAPTER XIII,bell-handle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught
29156,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie's eye and annoyed her.
29157,CHAPTER XIII,
29158,CHAPTER XIII,"""Horrid thing! It should be all white,"" she murmured. ""And the gate"
29159,CHAPTER XIII,"isn't in the middle of the wall, either. I never noticed that before."""
29160,CHAPTER XIII,
29161,CHAPTER XIII,"Maisie was hard to please at that hour. First, the heat of the past few"
29162,CHAPTER XIII,"weeks had worn her down; secondly, her work, and particularly the study"
29163,CHAPTER XIII,of a female head intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished
29164,CHAPTER XIII,"in time for the Salon, was unsatisfactory; thirdly, Kami had said as"
29165,CHAPTER XIII,"much two days before; fourthly,--but so completely fourthly that it was"
29166,CHAPTER XIII,"hardly worth thinking about,--Dick, her property, had not written to"
29167,CHAPTER XIII,"her for more than six weeks. She was angry with the heat, with Kami, and"
29168,CHAPTER XIII,"with her work, but she was exceedingly angry with Dick."
29169,CHAPTER XIII,
29170,CHAPTER XIII,"She had written to him three times,--each time proposing a fresh"
29171,CHAPTER XIII,treatment of her Melancolia. Dick had taken no notice of these
29172,CHAPTER XIII,communications. She had resolved to write no more. When she returned
29173,CHAPTER XIII,to England in the autumn--for her pride's sake she could not return
29174,CHAPTER XIII,earlier--she would speak to him. She missed the Sunday afternoon
29175,CHAPTER XIII,"conferences more than she cared to admit. All that Kami said was,"
29176,CHAPTER XIII,"""Continuez, mademoiselle, continuez toujours,"" and he had been repeating"
29177,CHAPTER XIII,"the wearisome counsel through the hot summer, exactly like a cicada,--an"
29178,CHAPTER XIII,"old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat, white trousers, and a huge felt"
29179,CHAPTER XIII,hat.
29180,CHAPTER XIII,
29181,CHAPTER XIII,But Dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north
29182,CHAPTER XIII,"of the cool green London park, and had said things ten times worse than"
29183,CHAPTER XIII,"continuez, before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her"
29184,CHAPTER XIII,"where the error lay. His last letter, Maisie remembered, contained"
29185,CHAPTER XIII,some trivial advice about not sketching in the sun or drinking water at
29186,CHAPTER XIII,"wayside farmhouses; and he had said that not once, but three times,--as"
29187,CHAPTER XIII,if he did not know that Maisie could take care of herself.
29188,CHAPTER XIII,
29189,CHAPTER XIII,"But what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write? A murmur of"
29190,CHAPTER XIII,voices in the road made her lean from the window. A cavalryman of the
29191,CHAPTER XIII,little garrison in the town was talking to Kami's cook. The moonlight
29192,CHAPTER XIII,"glittered on the scabbard of his sabre, which he was holding in his hand"
29193,CHAPTER XIII,lest it should clank inopportunely. The cook's cap cast deep shadows on
29194,CHAPTER XIII,"her face, which was close to the conscript's. He slid his arm round her"
29195,CHAPTER XIII,"waist, and there followed the sound of a kiss."
29196,CHAPTER XIII,
29197,CHAPTER XIII,"""Faugh!"" said Maisie, stepping back."
29198,CHAPTER XIII,
29199,CHAPTER XIII,"""What's that?"" said the red-haired girl, who was tossing uneasily"
29200,CHAPTER XIII,outside her bed.
29201,CHAPTER XIII,
29202,CHAPTER XIII,"""Only a conscript kissing the cook,"" said Maisie."
29203,CHAPTER XIII,
29204,CHAPTER XIII,"""They've gone away now."" She leaned out of the window again, and put a"
29205,CHAPTER XIII,shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills. There was a very small
29206,CHAPTER XIII,"night-breeze abroad, and a sun-baked rose below nodded its head as one"
29207,CHAPTER XIII,who knew unutterable secrets. Was it possible that Dick should turn his
29208,CHAPTER XIII,thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of
29209,CHAPTER XIII,Suzanne and the conscript? He could not! The rose nodded its head and
29210,CHAPTER XIII,one leaf therewith. It looked like a naughty little devil scratching its
29211,CHAPTER XIII,ear.
29212,CHAPTER XIII,
29213,CHAPTER XIII,"Dick could not, ""because,"" thought Maisie, ""he is mine,--mine,--mine. He"
29214,CHAPTER XIII,said he was. I'm sure I don't care what he does. It will only spoil his
29215,CHAPTER XIII,"work if he does; and it will spoil mine too."""
29216,CHAPTER XIII,
29217,CHAPTER XIII,The rose continued to nod in the futile way peculiar to flowers. There
29218,CHAPTER XIII,"was no earthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose,"
29219,CHAPTER XIII,"except that he was called by Providence, which was Maisie, to assist"
29220,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie in her work. And her work was the preparation of pictures that
29221,CHAPTER XIII,"went sometimes to English provincial exhibitions, as the notices in the"
29222,CHAPTER XIII,"scrap-book proved, and that were invariably rejected by the Salon when"
29223,CHAPTER XIII,Kami was plagued into allowing her to send them up. Her work in the
29224,CHAPTER XIII,"future, it seemed, would be the preparation of pictures on exactly"
29225,CHAPTER XIII,similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same way----The
29226,CHAPTER XIII,"red-haired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets. ""It's too hot"
29227,CHAPTER XIII,"to sleep,"" she moaned; and the interruption jarred."
29228,CHAPTER XIII,
29229,CHAPTER XIII,Exactly the same way. Then she would divide her years between the little
29230,CHAPTER XIII,"studio in England and Kami's big studio at Vitry-sur-Marne. No, she"
29231,CHAPTER XIII,"would go to another master, who should force her into the success that"
29232,CHAPTER XIII,"was her right, if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a"
29233,CHAPTER XIII,right to anything. Dick had told her that he had worked ten years to
29234,CHAPTER XIII,"understand his craft. She had worked ten years, and ten years were"
29235,CHAPTER XIII,"nothing. Dick had said that ten years were nothing,--but that was in"
29236,CHAPTER XIII,regard to herself only. He had said--this very man who could not find
29237,CHAPTER XIII,"time to write--that he would wait ten years for her, and that she was"
29238,CHAPTER XIII,bound to come back to him sooner or later. He had said this in the
29239,CHAPTER XIII,absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria; and then he had stopped
29240,CHAPTER XIII,"writing. He was wandering up and down moonlit streets, kissing cooks."
29241,CHAPTER XIII,"She would like to lecture him now,--not in her nightgown, of course,"
29242,CHAPTER XIII,"but properly dressed, severely and from a height. Yet if he was kissing"
29243,CHAPTER XIII,other girls he certainly would not care whether she lecture him or not.
29244,CHAPTER XIII,He would laugh at her. Very good.
29245,CHAPTER XIII,
29246,CHAPTER XIII,"She would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went, etc.,"
29247,CHAPTER XIII,etc.
29248,CHAPTER XIII,
29249,CHAPTER XIII,"The mill-wheel of thought swung round slowly, that no section of it"
29250,CHAPTER XIII,"might be slurred over, and the red-haired girl tossed and turned behind"
29251,CHAPTER XIII,her.
29252,CHAPTER XIII,
29253,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no
29254,CHAPTER XIII,"doubt whatever of the villainy of Dick. To justify herself, she began,"
29255,CHAPTER XIII,"unwomanly, to weigh the evidence. There was a boy, and he had said he"
29256,CHAPTER XIII,"loved her. And he kissed her,--kissed her on the cheek,--by a yellow"
29257,CHAPTER XIII,sea-poppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in
29258,CHAPTER XIII,"the garden. Then there was an interval, and men had told her that they"
29259,CHAPTER XIII,loved her--just when she was busiest with her work. Then the boy came
29260,CHAPTER XIII,"back, and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her."
29261,CHAPTER XIII,Then he had----But there was no end to the things he had done. He
29262,CHAPTER XIII,had given her his time and his powers. He had spoken to her of
29263,CHAPTER XIII,"Art, housekeeping, technique, teacups, the abuse of pickles as a"
29264,CHAPTER XIII,"stimulant,--that was rude,--sable hair-brushes,--he had given her the"
29265,CHAPTER XIII,"best in her stock,--she used them daily; he had given her advice that"
29266,CHAPTER XIII,"she profited by, and now and again--a look. Such a look! The look of a"
29267,CHAPTER XIII,beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistress's feet. In
29268,CHAPTER XIII,"return she had given him nothing whatever, except--here she brushed her"
29269,CHAPTER XIII,mouth against the open-work sleeve of her nightgown--the privilege
29270,CHAPTER XIII,"of kissing her once. And on the mouth, too. Disgraceful! Was that not"
29271,CHAPTER XIII,"enough, and more than enough? and if it was not, had he not cancelled"
29272,CHAPTER XIII,"the debt by not writing and--probably kissing other girls? ""Maisie,"
29273,CHAPTER XIII,"you'll catch a chill. Do go and lie down,"" said the wearied voice of her"
29274,CHAPTER XIII,"companion. ""I can't sleep a wink with you at the window."""
29275,CHAPTER XIII,
29276,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer. She was reflecting
29277,CHAPTER XIII,"on the meannesses of Dick, and on other meannesses with which he had"
29278,CHAPTER XIII,nothing to do. The moonlight would not let her sleep. It lay on the
29279,CHAPTER XIII,skylight of the studio across the road in cold silver; she stared at it
29280,CHAPTER XIII,intently and her thoughts began to slide one into the other. The shadow
29281,CHAPTER XIII,"of the big bell-handle in the wall grew short, lengthened again, and"
29282,CHAPTER XIII,faded out as the moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came
29283,CHAPTER XIII,limping home across the road. Then the dawn-wind washed through the
29284,CHAPTER XIII,"upland grasses, and brought coolness with it, and the cattle lowed by"
29285,CHAPTER XIII,"the drought-shrunk river. Maisie's head fell forward on the window-sill,"
29286,CHAPTER XIII,and the tangle of black hair covered her arms.
29287,CHAPTER XIII,
29288,CHAPTER XIII,"""Maisie, wake up. You'll catch a chill."""
29289,CHAPTER XIII,
29290,CHAPTER XIII,"""Yes, dear; yes, dear."" She staggered to her bed like a wearied child,"
29291,CHAPTER XIII,"and as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered, ""I think--I"
29292,CHAPTER XIII,"think--But he ought to have written."""
29293,CHAPTER XIII,
29294,CHAPTER XIII,"Day brought the routine of the studio, the smell of paint and"
29295,CHAPTER XIII,"turpentine, and the monotone wisdom of Kami, who was a leaden artist,"
29296,CHAPTER XIII,but a golden teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him. Maisie
29297,CHAPTER XIII,"was not in sympathy that day, and she waited impatiently for the end of"
29298,CHAPTER XIII,the work.
29299,CHAPTER XIII,
29300,CHAPTER XIII,She knew when it was coming; for Kami would gather his black alpaca
29301,CHAPTER XIII,"coat into a bunch behind him, and, with faded flue eyes that saw neither"
29302,CHAPTER XIII,"pupils nor canvas, look back into the past to recall the history of one"
29303,CHAPTER XIII,"Binat. ""You have all done not so badly,"" he would say. ""But you shall"
29304,CHAPTER XIII,"remember that it is not enough to have the method, and the art, and"
29305,CHAPTER XIII,"the power, nor even that which is touch, but you shall have also"
29306,CHAPTER XIII,the conviction that nails the work to the wall. Of the so many I
29307,CHAPTER XIII,"taught,""--here the students would begin to unfix drawing-pins or get"
29308,CHAPTER XIII,"their tubes together,--""the very so many that I have taught, the best"
29309,CHAPTER XIII,was Binat. All that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge
29310,CHAPTER XIII,was to him even when he came. After he left me he should have done all
29311,CHAPTER XIII,"that could be done with the colour, the form, and the knowledge. Only,"
29312,CHAPTER XIII,"he had not the conviction. So today I hear no more of Binat,--the best"
29313,CHAPTER XIII,"of my pupils,--and that is long ago. So today, too, you will be glad"
29314,CHAPTER XIII,"to hear no more of me. Continuez, mesdemoiselles, and, above all, with"
29315,CHAPTER XIII,"conviction."""
29316,CHAPTER XIII,
29317,CHAPTER XIII,He went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost Binat as the
29318,CHAPTER XIII,pupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to
29319,CHAPTER XIII,make plans for the cool of the afternoon.
29320,CHAPTER XIII,
29321,CHAPTER XIII,"Maisie looked at her very unhappy Melancolia, restrained a desire to"
29322,CHAPTER XIII,"grimace before it, and was hurrying across the road to write a letter"
29323,CHAPTER XIII,"to Dick, when she was aware of a large man on a white troop-horse. How"
29324,CHAPTER XIII,Torpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to
29325,CHAPTER XIII,"the hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at Vitry-sur-Marne, to"
29326,CHAPTER XIII,"discuss with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for France, to"
29327,CHAPTER XIII,"reduce the colonel to tears of pure affability, and to borrow the best"
29328,CHAPTER XIII,"horse in the squadron for the journey to Kami's studio, is a mystery"
29329,CHAPTER XIII,that only special correspondents can unravel.
29330,CHAPTER XIII,
29331,CHAPTER XIII,"""I beg your pardon,"" said he. ""It seems an absurd question to ask, but"
29332,CHAPTER XIII,the fact is that I don't know her by any other name: Is there any young
29333,CHAPTER XIII,"lady here that is called Maisie?"""
29334,CHAPTER XIII,
29335,CHAPTER XIII,"""I am Maisie,"" was the answer from the depths of a great sun-hat."
29336,CHAPTER XIII,
29337,CHAPTER XIII,"""I ought to introduce myself,"" he said, as the horse capered in the"
29338,CHAPTER XIII,"blinding white dust. ""My name is Torpenhow. Dick Heldar is my best"
29339,CHAPTER XIII,"friend, and--and--the fact is that he has gone blind."""
29340,CHAPTER XIII,
29341,CHAPTER XIII,"""Blind!"" said Maisie, stupidly. ""He can't be blind."""
29342,CHAPTER XIII,
29343,CHAPTER XIII,"""He has been stone-blind for nearly two months."""
29344,CHAPTER XIII,
29345,CHAPTER XIII,"Maisie lifted up her face, and it was pearly white. ""No! No! Not blind!"
29346,CHAPTER XIII,"I won't have him blind!"""
29347,CHAPTER XIII,
29348,CHAPTER XIII,"""Would you care to see for yourself?"" said Torpenhow."
29349,CHAPTER XIII,
29350,CHAPTER XIII,"""Now,--at once?"""
29351,CHAPTER XIII,
29352,CHAPTER XIII,"""Oh, no! The Paris train doesn't go through this place till tonight."
29353,CHAPTER XIII,"There will be ample time."""
29354,CHAPTER XIII,
29355,CHAPTER XIII,"""Did Mr. Heldar send you to me?"""
29356,CHAPTER XIII,
29357,CHAPTER XIII,"""Certainly not. Dick wouldn't do that sort of thing. He's sitting in"
29358,CHAPTER XIII,"his studio, turning over some letters that he can't read because he's"
29359,CHAPTER XIII,"blind."""
29360,CHAPTER XIII,
29361,CHAPTER XIII,There was a sound of choking from the sun-hat. Maisie bowed her head
29362,CHAPTER XIII,"and went into the cottage, where the red-haired girl was on a sofa,"
29363,CHAPTER XIII,complaining of a headache.
29364,CHAPTER XIII,
29365,CHAPTER XIII,"""Dick's blind!"" said Maisie, taking her breath quickly as she steadied"
29366,CHAPTER XIII,"herself against a chair-back. ""My Dick's blind!"""
29367,CHAPTER XIII,
29368,CHAPTER XIII,"""What?"" The girl was on the sofa no longer."
29369,CHAPTER XIII,
29370,CHAPTER XIII,"""A man has come from England to tell me. He hasn't written to me for six"
29371,CHAPTER XIII,"weeks."""
29372,CHAPTER XIII,
29373,CHAPTER XIII,"""Are you going to him?"""
29374,CHAPTER XIII,
29375,CHAPTER XIII,"""I must think."""
29376,CHAPTER XIII,
29377,CHAPTER XIII,"""Think! I should go back to London and see him and I should kiss his"
29378,CHAPTER XIII,eyes and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again! If you don't
29379,CHAPTER XIII,"go I shall. Oh, what am I talking about? You wicked little idiot! Go to"
29380,CHAPTER XIII,"him at once. Go!"""
29381,CHAPTER XIII,
29382,CHAPTER XIII,"Torpenhow's neck was blistering, but he preserved a smile of infinite"
29383,CHAPTER XIII,patience as Maisie's appeared bareheaded in the sunshine.
29384,CHAPTER XIII,
29385,CHAPTER XIII,"""I am coming,"" said she, her eyes on the ground."
29386,CHAPTER XIII,
29387,CHAPTER XIII,"""You will be at Vitry Station, then, at seven this evening."" This was"
29388,CHAPTER XIII,an order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed. Maisie said
29389,CHAPTER XIII,"nothing, but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing"
29390,CHAPTER XIII,with this big man who took everything for granted and managed a
29391,CHAPTER XIII,"squealing horse with one hand. She returned to the red-haired girl,"
29392,CHAPTER XIII,"who was weeping bitterly, and between tears, kisses,--very few of"
29393,CHAPTER XIII,"those,--menthol, packing, and an interview with Kami, the sultry"
29394,CHAPTER XIII,afternoon wore away.
29395,CHAPTER XIII,
29396,CHAPTER XIII,"Thought might come afterwards. Her present duty was to go to Dick,--Dick"
29397,CHAPTER XIII,who owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her
29398,CHAPTER XIII,unopened letters.
29399,CHAPTER XIII,
29400,CHAPTER XIII,"""But what will you do,"" she said to her companion."
29401,CHAPTER XIII,
29402,CHAPTER XIII,"""I? Oh, I shall stay here and--finish your Melancolia,"" she said,"
29403,CHAPTER XIII,"smiling pitifully. ""Write to me afterwards."""
29404,CHAPTER XIII,
29405,CHAPTER XIII,That night there ran a legend through Vitry-sur-Marne of a mad
29406,CHAPTER XIII,"Englishman, doubtless suffering from sunstroke, who had drunk all the"
29407,CHAPTER XIII,"officers of the garrison under the table, had borrowed a horse from the"
29408,CHAPTER XIII,"lines, and had then and there eloped, after the English custom, with one"
29409,CHAPTER XIII,of those more mad English girls who drew pictures down there under the
29410,CHAPTER XIII,care of that good Monsieur Kami.
29411,CHAPTER XIII,
29412,CHAPTER XIII,"""They are very droll,"" said Suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight"
29413,CHAPTER XIII,"by the studio wall. ""She walked always with those big eyes that saw"
29414,CHAPTER XIII,"nothing, and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my"
29415,CHAPTER XIII,"sister, and gives me--see--ten francs!"""
29416,CHAPTER XIII,
29417,CHAPTER XIII,The conscript levied a contribution on both gifts; for he prided himself
29418,CHAPTER XIII,on being a good soldier.
29419,CHAPTER XIII,
29420,CHAPTER XIII,Torpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais;
29421,CHAPTER XIII,"but he was careful to attend to all her wants, to get her a compartment"
29422,CHAPTER XIII,"entirely to herself, and to leave her alone. He was amazed of the ease"
29423,CHAPTER XIII,with which the matter had been accomplished.
29424,CHAPTER XIII,
29425,CHAPTER XIII,"""The safest thing would be to let her think things out. By Dick's"
29426,CHAPTER XIII,"showing,--when he was off his head,--she must have ordered him about"
29427,CHAPTER XIII,"very thoroughly. Wonder how she likes being under orders."""
29428,CHAPTER XIII,
29429,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie never told. She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes
29430,CHAPTER XIII,"shut, that she might realise the sensation of blindness. It was an order"
29431,CHAPTER XIII,"that she should return to London swiftly, and she found herself at last"
29432,CHAPTER XIII,almost beginning to enjoy the situation. This was better than looking
29433,CHAPTER XIII,after luggage and a red-haired friend who never took any interest in her
29434,CHAPTER XIII,"surroundings. But there appeared to be a feeling in the air that she,"
29435,CHAPTER XIII,"Maisie,--of all people,--was in disgrace. Therefore she justified her"
29436,CHAPTER XIII,"conduct to herself with great success, till Torpenhow came up to her"
29437,CHAPTER XIII,on the steamer and without preface began to tell the story of Dick's
29438,CHAPTER XIII,"blindness, suppressing a few details, but dwelling at length on the"
29439,CHAPTER XIII,"miseries of delirium. He stopped before he reached the end, as though he"
29440,CHAPTER XIII,"had lost interest in the subject, and went forward to smoke. Maisie was"
29441,CHAPTER XIII,furious with him and with herself.
29442,CHAPTER XIII,
29443,CHAPTER XIII,She was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for
29444,CHAPTER XIII,"breakfast, and--she was past any feeling of indignation now--was bidden"
29445,CHAPTER XIII,curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some lead-covered stairs while
29446,CHAPTER XIII,Torpenhow went up to make inquiries. Again the knowledge that she was
29447,CHAPTER XIII,being treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame. It
29448,CHAPTER XIII,was all Dick's fault for being so stupid as to go blind.
29449,CHAPTER XIII,
29450,CHAPTER XIII,"Torpenhow led her up to a shut door, which he opened very softly. Dick"
29451,CHAPTER XIII,"was sitting by the window, with his chin on his chest. There were three"
29452,CHAPTER XIII,"envelopes in his hand, and he turned them over and over. The big man"
29453,CHAPTER XIII,"who gave orders was no longer by her side, and the studio door snapped"
29454,CHAPTER XIII,behind her.
29455,CHAPTER XIII,
29456,CHAPTER XIII,"Dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound. ""Hullo,"
29457,CHAPTER XIII,"Torp! Is that you? I've been so lonely."""
29458,CHAPTER XIII,
29459,CHAPTER XIII,His voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind. Maisie pressed
29460,CHAPTER XIII,"herself up into a corner of the room. Her heart was beating furiously,"
29461,CHAPTER XIII,and she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet. Dick was staring
29462,CHAPTER XIII,"directly at her, and she realised for the first time that he was blind."
29463,CHAPTER XIII,
29464,CHAPTER XIII,Shutting her eyes in a rail-way carriage to open them when she pleased
29465,CHAPTER XIII,was child's play. This man was blind though his eyes were wide open.
29466,CHAPTER XIII,
29467,CHAPTER XIII,"""Torp, is that you? They said you were coming."" Dick looked puzzled and"
29468,CHAPTER XIII,a little irritated at the silence.
29469,CHAPTER XIII,
29470,CHAPTER XIII,"""No; it's only me,"" was the answer, in a strained little whisper. Maisie"
29471,CHAPTER XIII,could hardly move her lips.
29472,CHAPTER XIII,
29473,CHAPTER XIII,"""H'm!"" said Dick, composedly, without moving. ""This is a new phenomenon."
29474,CHAPTER XIII,"Darkness I'm getting used to; but I object to hearing voices."""
29475,CHAPTER XIII,
29476,CHAPTER XIII,"Was he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself? Maisie's"
29477,CHAPTER XIII,"heart beat more wildly, and she breathed in gasps. Dick rose and began"
29478,CHAPTER XIII,"to feel his way across the room, touching each table and chair as he"
29479,CHAPTER XIII,"passed. Once he caught his foot on a rug, and swore, dropping on his"
29480,CHAPTER XIII,knees to feel what the obstruction might be. Maisie remembered him
29481,CHAPTER XIII,"walking in the Park as though all the earth belonged to him, tramping"
29482,CHAPTER XIII,"up and down her studio two months ago, and flying up the gangway of the"
29483,CHAPTER XIII,"Channel steamer. The beating of her heart was making her sick, and Dick"
29484,CHAPTER XIII,"was coming nearer, guided by the sound of her breathing. She put out a"
29485,CHAPTER XIII,"hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to herself, she did not"
29486,CHAPTER XIII,"know which. It touched his chest, and he stepped back as though he had"
29487,CHAPTER XIII,been shot.
29488,CHAPTER XIII,
29489,CHAPTER XIII,"""It's Maisie!"" said he, with a dry sob. ""What are you doing here?"""
29490,CHAPTER XIII,
29491,CHAPTER XIII,"""I came--I came--to see you, please."""
29492,CHAPTER XIII,
29493,CHAPTER XIII,Dick's lips closed firmly.
29494,CHAPTER XIII,
29495,CHAPTER XIII,"""Won't you sit down, then? You see, I've had some bother with my eyes,"
29496,CHAPTER XIII,"and----"""
29497,CHAPTER XIII,
29498,CHAPTER XIII,"""I know. I know. Why didn't you tell me?"""
29499,CHAPTER XIII,
29500,CHAPTER XIII,"""I couldn't write."""
29501,CHAPTER XIII,
29502,CHAPTER XIII,"""You might have told Mr. Torpenhow."""
29503,CHAPTER XIII,
29504,CHAPTER XIII,"""What has he to do with my affairs?"""
29505,CHAPTER XIII,
29506,CHAPTER XIII,"""He--he brought me from Vitry-sur-Marne. He thought I ought to see you."""
29507,CHAPTER XIII,
29508,CHAPTER XIII,"""Why, what has happened? Can I do anything for you? No, I can't. I"
29509,CHAPTER XIII,"forgot."""
29510,CHAPTER XIII,
29511,CHAPTER XIII,"""Oh, Dick, I'm so sorry! I've come to tell you, and----Let me take you"
29512,CHAPTER XIII,"back to your chair."""
29513,CHAPTER XIII,
29514,CHAPTER XIII,"""Don't! I'm not a child. You only do that out of pity. I never meant to"
29515,CHAPTER XIII,tell you anything about it. I'm no good now. I'm down and done for. Let
29516,CHAPTER XIII,"me alone!"""
29517,CHAPTER XIII,
29518,CHAPTER XIII,"He groped back to his chair, his chest labouring as he sat down."
29519,CHAPTER XIII,
29520,CHAPTER XIII,"Maisie watched him, and the fear went out of her heart, to be followed"
29521,CHAPTER XIII,by a very bitter shame. He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from
29522,CHAPTER XIII,the girl through every step of the impetuous flight to London; for he
29523,CHAPTER XIII,"was, indeed, down and done for--masterful no longer but rather a little"
29524,CHAPTER XIII,"abject; neither an artist stronger than she, nor a man to be looked up"
29525,CHAPTER XIII,to--only some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of
29526,CHAPTER XIII,crying. She was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for him--more sorry than
29527,CHAPTER XIII,"she had ever been for any one in her life, but not sorry enough to deny"
29528,CHAPTER XIII,his words.
29529,CHAPTER XIII,
29530,CHAPTER XIII,"So she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt, because she had"
29531,CHAPTER XIII,honestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly; and now she
29532,CHAPTER XIII,was only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love.
29533,CHAPTER XIII,
29534,CHAPTER XIII,"""Well?"" said Dick, his face steadily turned away. ""I never meant to"
29535,CHAPTER XIII,"worry you any more. What's the matter?"""
29536,CHAPTER XIII,
29537,CHAPTER XIII,"He was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath, but was as"
29538,CHAPTER XIII,unprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed. She had
29539,CHAPTER XIII,dropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands.
29540,CHAPTER XIII,
29541,CHAPTER XIII,"""I can't--I can't!"" she cried desperately. ""Indeed, I can't. It isn't my"
29542,CHAPTER XIII,"fault. I'm so sorry. Oh, Dickie, I'm so sorry."""
29543,CHAPTER XIII,
29544,CHAPTER XIII,"Dick's shoulders straightened again, for the words lashed like a whip."
29545,CHAPTER XIII,
29546,CHAPTER XIII,Still the sobbing continued. It is not good to realise that you have
29547,CHAPTER XIII,failed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of
29548,CHAPTER XIII,making sacrifices.
29549,CHAPTER XIII,
29550,CHAPTER XIII,"""I do despise myself--indeed I do. But I can't. Oh, Dickie, you wouldn't"
29551,CHAPTER XIII,"ask me--would you?"" wailed Maisie."
29552,CHAPTER XIII,
29553,CHAPTER XIII,"She looked up for a minute, and by chance it happened that Dick's eyes"
29554,CHAPTER XIII,"fell on hers. The unshaven face was very white and set, and the lips"
29555,CHAPTER XIII,were trying to force themselves into a smile. But it was the worn-out
29556,CHAPTER XIII,eyes that Maisie feared. Her Dick had gone blind and left in his place
29557,CHAPTER XIII,some one that she could hardly recognise till he spoke.
29558,CHAPTER XIII,
29559,CHAPTER XIII,"""Who is asking you to do anything, Maisie? I told you how it would be."
29560,CHAPTER XIII,What's the use of worrying? For pity's sake don't cry like that; it
29561,CHAPTER XIII,"isn't worth it."""
29562,CHAPTER XIII,
29563,CHAPTER XIII,"""You don't know how I hate myself. Oh, Dick, help me--help me!"" The"
29564,CHAPTER XIII,passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm
29565,CHAPTER XIII,"the man. He stumbled forward and put his arm round her, and her head"
29566,CHAPTER XIII,fell on his shoulder.
29567,CHAPTER XIII,
29568,CHAPTER XIII,"""Hush, dear, hush! Don't cry. You're quite right, and you've nothing to"
29569,CHAPTER XIII,reproach yourself with--you never had. You're only a little upset by the
29570,CHAPTER XIII,"journey, and I don't suppose you've had any breakfast. What a brute Torp"
29571,CHAPTER XIII,"was to bring you over."""
29572,CHAPTER XIII,
29573,CHAPTER XIII,"""I wanted to come. I did indeed,"" she protested."
29574,CHAPTER XIII,
29575,CHAPTER XIII,"""Very well. And now you've come and seen, and I'm--immensely grateful."
29576,CHAPTER XIII,When you're better you shall go away and get something to eat. What sort
29577,CHAPTER XIII,"of a passage did you have coming over?"""
29578,CHAPTER XIII,
29579,CHAPTER XIII,"Maisie was crying more subduedly, for the first time in her life glad"
29580,CHAPTER XIII,that she had something to lean against. Dick patted her on the shoulder
29581,CHAPTER XIII,"tenderly but clumsily, for he was not quite sure where her shoulder"
29582,CHAPTER XIII,might be.
29583,CHAPTER XIII,
29584,CHAPTER XIII,"She drew herself out of his arms at last and waited, trembling and most"
29585,CHAPTER XIII,unhappy. He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room
29586,CHAPTER XIII,"between them, and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart."
29587,CHAPTER XIII,
29588,CHAPTER XIII,"""Are you better now?"" he said."
29589,CHAPTER XIII,
29590,CHAPTER XIII,"""Yes, but--don't you hate me?"""
29591,CHAPTER XIII,
29592,CHAPTER XIII,"""I hate you? My God! I?"""
29593,CHAPTER XIII,
29594,CHAPTER XIII,"""Isn't--isn't there anything I could do for you, then? I'll stay here"
29595,CHAPTER XIII,"in England to do it, if you like. Perhaps I could come and see you"
29596,CHAPTER XIII,"sometimes."""
29597,CHAPTER XIII,
29598,CHAPTER XIII,"""I think not, dear. It would be kindest not to see me any more, please."
29599,CHAPTER XIII,"I don't want to seem rude, but--don't you think--perhaps you had almost"
29600,CHAPTER XIII,"better go now."""
29601,CHAPTER XIII,
29602,CHAPTER XIII,He was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain
29603,CHAPTER XIII,continued much longer.
29604,CHAPTER XIII,
29605,CHAPTER XIII,"""I don't deserve anything else. I'll go, Dick. Oh, I'm so miserable."""
29606,CHAPTER XIII,
29607,CHAPTER XIII,"""Nonsense. You've nothing to worry about; I'd tell you if you had. Wait"
29608,CHAPTER XIII,"a moment, dear. I've got something to give you first. I meant it for"

29612,CHAPTER XIII,"market."" He groped among his canvases. ""She's framed in black. Is this"
29613,CHAPTER XIII,a black frame that I have my hand on? There she is. What do you think of

29615,CHAPTER XIII,
29616,CHAPTER XIII,"He turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie, and the"
29617,CHAPTER XIII,eyes strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise. One
29618,CHAPTER XIII,thing and one thing only could she do for him.
29619,CHAPTER XIII,
29620,CHAPTER XIII,"""Well?"""
29621,CHAPTER XIII,
29622,CHAPTER XIII,"The voice was fuller and more rounded, because the man knew he was"
29623,CHAPTER XIII,"speaking of his best work. Maisie looked at the blur, and a lunatic"
29624,CHAPTER XIII,desire to laugh caught her by the throat. But for Dick's sake--whatever
29625,CHAPTER XIII,this mad blankness might mean--she must make no sign. Her voice choked
29626,CHAPTER XIII,"with hard-held tears as she answered, still gazing at the wreck--""Oh,"
29627,CHAPTER XIII,"Dick, it is good!"""
29628,CHAPTER XIII,
29629,CHAPTER XIII,"He heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute. ""Won't you"
29630,CHAPTER XIII,"have it, then? I'll send it over to your house if you will."""
29631,CHAPTER XIII,
29632,CHAPTER XIII,"""I? Oh yes--thank you. Ha! ha!"" If she did not fly at once the laughter"
29633,CHAPTER XIII,"that was worse than tears would kill her. She turned and ran, choking"
29634,CHAPTER XIII,"and blinded, down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge"
29635,CHAPTER XIII,in a cab and go to her house across the Parks. There she sat down in the
29636,CHAPTER XIII,"dismantled drawing-room and thought of Dick in his blindness, useless"
29637,CHAPTER XIII,"till the end of life, and of herself in her own eyes. Behind the sorrow,"
29638,CHAPTER XIII,"the shame, and the humiliation, lay fear of the cold wrath of the"
29639,CHAPTER XIII,red-haired girl when Maisie should return. Maisie had never feared her
29640,CHAPTER XIII,"companion before. Not until she found herself saying, ""Well, he never"
29641,CHAPTER XIII,"asked me,"" did she realise her scorn of herself. And that is the end of"
29642,CHAPTER XIII,Maisie.

29645,CHAPTER XIII,
29646,CHAPTER XIII,For Dick was reserved more searching torment. He could not realise at
29647,CHAPTER XIII,"first that Maisie, whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word"
29648,CHAPTER XIII,"of farewell. He was savagely angry against Torpenhow, who had brought"
29649,CHAPTER XIII,upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace. Then his
29650,CHAPTER XIII,dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what
29651,CHAPTER XIII,"help he could from the darkness. The queen could do no wrong, but in"
29652,CHAPTER XIII,"following the right, so far as it served her work, she had wounded her"
29653,CHAPTER XIII,one subject more than his own brain would let him know.
29654,CHAPTER XIII,
29655,CHAPTER XIII,"""It's all I had and I've lost it,"" he said, as soon as the misery"
29656,CHAPTER XIII,"permitted clear thinking. ""And Torp will think that he has been so"
29657,CHAPTER XIII,infernally clever that I shan't have the heart to tell him. I must think
29658,CHAPTER XIII,"this out quietly."""
29659,CHAPTER XIII,
29660,CHAPTER XIII,"""Hullo!"" said Torpenhow, entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed two"
29661,CHAPTER XIII,"hours of thought. ""I'm back. Are you feeling any better?"""
29662,CHAPTER XIII,
29663,CHAPTER XIII,"""Torp, I don't know what to say. Come here."" Dick coughed huskily,"
29664,CHAPTER XIII,"wondering, indeed, what he should say, and how to say it temperately."
29665,CHAPTER XIII,
29666,CHAPTER XIII,"""What's the need for saying anything? Get up and tramp."" Torpenhow was"
29667,CHAPTER XIII,perfectly satisfied.
29668,CHAPTER XIII,

29670,CHAPTER XIII,"shoulder, and Dick buried in his own thoughts."

29704,CHAPTER XIII,That night there was a tumult on the stairs. The correspondents poured
29705,CHAPTER XIII,"in from theatre, dinner, and music-hall to Torpenhow's room that they"
29706,CHAPTER XIII,might discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations
29707,CHAPTER XIII,"becoming a certainty. Torpenhow, the Keneu, and the Nilghai had bidden"
29708,CHAPTER XIII,"all the men they had worked with to the orgy; and Mr. Beeton, the"
29709,CHAPTER XIII,"housekeeper, declared that never before in his checkered experience had"
29710,CHAPTER XIII,he seen quite such a fancy lot of gentlemen. They waked the chambers
29711,CHAPTER XIII,with shoutings and song; and the elder men were quite as bad as the
29712,CHAPTER XIII,"younger. For the chances of war were in front of them, and all knew what"
29713,CHAPTER XIII,those meant.
29714,CHAPTER XIII,
29715,CHAPTER XIII,Sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the

29794,CHAPTER XIII,doorway of Torpenhow's room when the latter was packing and asked
29795,CHAPTER XIII,"innumerable questions about the coming campaign, till Torpenhow began to"

29853,CHAPTER XIV,
29854,CHAPTER XIV,Mr. Beeton withdrew and left Dick to himself. Torpenhow had been long
29855,CHAPTER XIV,"away; there was no more rioting in the chambers, and Dick had settled"
29856,CHAPTER XIV,"down to his new life, which he was weak enough to consider nothing"
29857,CHAPTER XIV,better than death.
29858,CHAPTER XIV,
29859,CHAPTER XIV,"It is hard to live alone in the dark, confusing the day and night;"
29860,CHAPTER XIV,"dropping to sleep through sheer weariness at mid-day, and rising"
29861,CHAPTER XIV,"restless in the chill of the dawn. At first Dick, on his awakenings,"
29862,CHAPTER XIV,would grope along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one
29863,CHAPTER XIV,"snore. Then he would know that the day had not yet come, and return"
29864,CHAPTER XIV,wearily to his bedroom.
29865,CHAPTER XIV,
29866,CHAPTER XIV,Later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the
29867,CHAPTER XIV,"house and Mr. Beeton advised him to get up. Once dressed--and dressing,"
29868,CHAPTER XIV,"now that Torpenhow was away, was a lengthy business, because collars,"
29869,CHAPTER XIV,"ties, and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room, and search"
29870,CHAPTER XIV,"meant head-beating against chairs and trunks--once dressed, there was"
29871,CHAPTER XIV,nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the three
29872,CHAPTER XIV,daily meals came. Centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch
29873,CHAPTER XIV,"from dinner, and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his"
29874,CHAPTER XIV,"mind might be taken from him, God would never hear. Rather the mind"
29875,CHAPTER XIV,was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as
29876,CHAPTER XIV,millstones grind when there is no corn between; and yet the brain would
29877,CHAPTER XIV,"not wear out and give him rest. It continued to think, at length, with"
29878,CHAPTER XIV,imagery and all manner of reminiscences. It recalled Maisie and past
29879,CHAPTER XIV,"success, reckless travels by land and sea, the glory of doing work and"
29880,CHAPTER XIV,"feeling that it was good, and suggested all that might have happened had"
29881,CHAPTER XIV,the eyes only been faithful to their duty. When thinking ceased
29882,CHAPTER XIV,"through sheer weariness, there poured into Dick's soul tide on tide of"
29883,CHAPTER XIV,"overwhelming, purposeless fear--dread of starvation always, terror"
29884,CHAPTER XIV,"lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon him, fear of fire in the"
29885,CHAPTER XIV,"chambers and a louse's death in red flame, and agonies of fiercer horror"
29886,CHAPTER XIV,"that had nothing to do with any fear of death. Then Dick bowed his head,"
29887,CHAPTER XIV,and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating self till
29888,CHAPTER XIV,the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set before
29889,CHAPTER XIV,him.
29890,CHAPTER XIV,
29891,CHAPTER XIV,"Mr. Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare, and"
29892,CHAPTER XIV,"Dick learned to hang upon his speech, which dealt with badly fitted"
29893,CHAPTER XIV,"gas-plugs, waste-pipes out of repair, little tricks for driving"
29894,CHAPTER XIV,"picture-nails into walls, and the sins of the charwoman or the"
29895,CHAPTER XIV,housemaids. In the lack of better things the small gossip of a servants'
29896,CHAPTER XIV,"hall becomes immensely interesting, and the screwing of a washer on a"
29897,CHAPTER XIV,tap an event to be talked over for days.
29898,CHAPTER XIV,
29899,CHAPTER XIV,"Once or twice a week, too, Mr. Beeton would take Dick out with him when"
29900,CHAPTER XIV,"he went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish,"
29901,CHAPTER XIV,"lamp-wicks, mustard, tapioca, and so forth, while Dick rested his weight"
29902,CHAPTER XIV,first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly with the
29903,CHAPTER XIV,tins and string-ball on the counter. Then they would perhaps meet one of
29904,CHAPTER XIV,"Mr. Beeton's friends, and Dick, standing aside a little, would hold his"
29905,CHAPTER XIV,peace till Mr. Beeton was willing to go on again.
29906,CHAPTER XIV,
29907,CHAPTER XIV,The life did not increase his self-respect. He abandoned shaving as a
29908,CHAPTER XIV,"dangerous exercise, and being shaved in a barber's shop meant exposure"
29909,CHAPTER XIV,of his infirmity. He could not see that his clothes were properly
29910,CHAPTER XIV,"brushed, and since he had never taken any care of his personal"
29911,CHAPTER XIV,appearance he became every known variety of sloven. A blind man cannot
29912,CHAPTER XIV,deal with cleanliness till he has been some months used to the darkness.
29913,CHAPTER XIV,"If he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it, he must assert"
29914,CHAPTER XIV,himself and stand upright. Then the meanest menial can see that he is
29915,CHAPTER XIV,"blind and, therefore, of no consequence. A wise man will keep his eyes"
29916,CHAPTER XIV,on the floor and sit still. For amusement he may pick coal lump by lump
29917,CHAPTER XIV,out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the
29918,CHAPTER XIV,"fender, keeping count of the lumps, which must all be put back again,"
29919,CHAPTER XIV,one by one and very carefully. He may set himself sums if he cares to
29920,CHAPTER XIV,work them out; he may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to
29921,CHAPTER XIV,"visit him; and if his trade has been that of an artist, he may sketch"
29922,CHAPTER XIV,in the air with his forefinger; but that is too much like drawing a pig
29923,CHAPTER XIV,"with the eyes shut. He may go to his bookshelves and count his books,"
29924,CHAPTER XIV,ranging them in order of their size; or to his wardrobe and count his
29925,CHAPTER XIV,"shirts, laying them in piles of two or three on the bed, as they suffer"
29926,CHAPTER XIV,from frayed cuffs or lost buttons.
29927,CHAPTER XIV,
29928,CHAPTER XIV,Even this entertainment wearies after a time; and all the times are
29929,CHAPTER XIV,"very, very long."
29930,CHAPTER XIV,
29931,CHAPTER XIV,"Dick was allowed to sort a tool-chest where Mr. Beeton kept hammers,"
29932,CHAPTER XIV,"taps and nuts, lengths of gas-pipes, oil-bottles, and string."
29933,CHAPTER XIV,
29934,CHAPTER XIV,"""If I don't have everything just where I know where to look for it, why,"
29935,CHAPTER XIV,"then, I can't find anything when I do want it. You've no idea, sir, the"
29936,CHAPTER XIV,"amount of little things that these chambers uses up,"" said Mr. Beeton."
29937,CHAPTER XIV,
29938,CHAPTER XIV,"Fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out: ""It's hard on you,"

29940,CHAPTER XIV,
29941,CHAPTER XIV,"""I'll pay my rent and messing. Isn't that enough?"""

29947,CHAPTER XIV,
29948,CHAPTER XIV,"""I suppose so,"" said Dick, absently. This particular nerve through long"
29949,CHAPTER XIV,battering had ceased to feel--much.
29950,CHAPTER XIV,
29951,CHAPTER XIV,"""I was thinking,"" continued Mr. Beeton, still making as if to go, ""that"

29964,CHAPTER XIV,"Alf was not a nice child, being puffed up with many school-board"
29965,CHAPTER XIV,"certificates for good conduct, and inordinately proud of his singing."
29966,CHAPTER XIV,"Mr. Beeton remained, beaming, while the child wailed his way through"
29967,CHAPTER XIV,a song of some eight eight-line verses in the usual whine of a young
29968,CHAPTER XIV,"Cockney, and, after compliments, left him to read Dick the foreign"
29969,CHAPTER XIV,telegrams. Ten minutes later Alf returned to his parents rather pale and
29970,CHAPTER XIV,scared.

29991,CHAPTER XIV,
29992,CHAPTER XIV,"""He's best left to hisself--gentlemen always are when they're"

29994,CHAPTER XIV,
29995,CHAPTER XIV,Alf's rigorously limited powers of comprehending Torpenhow's special
29996,CHAPTER XIV,"correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. He could hear,"
29997,CHAPTER XIV,"through the boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind"
29998,CHAPTER XIV,the soldiers outside Suakin; could hear the men swearing and chaffing
29999,CHAPTER XIV,"across the cooking pots, and could smell the acrid wood-smoke as it"
30000,CHAPTER XIV,drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.
30001,CHAPTER XIV,
30002,CHAPTER XIV,"That night he prayed to God that his mind might be taken from him,"
30003,CHAPTER XIV,offering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he
30004,CHAPTER XIV,"had not shot himself long ago. That prayer was not answered, and indeed"
30005,CHAPTER XIV,Dick knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour
30006,CHAPTER XIV,"and no special virtue had kept him alive. Suicide, he had persuaded"
30007,CHAPTER XIV,"himself, would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as"
30008,CHAPTER XIV,well as a weak-kneed confession of fear.
30009,CHAPTER XIV,
30010,CHAPTER XIV,"""Just for the fun of the thing,"" he said to the cat, who had taken"
30011,CHAPTER XIV,"Binkie's place in his establishment, ""I should like to know how long"
30012,CHAPTER XIV,this is going to last. I can live for a year on the hundred pounds
30013,CHAPTER XIV,Torp cashed for me. I must have two or three thousand at least in the
30014,CHAPTER XIV,"Bank--twenty or thirty years more provided for, that is to say. Then I"
30015,CHAPTER XIV,"fall back on my hundred and twenty a year, which will be more by that"
30016,CHAPTER XIV,time. Let's consider.

30018,CHAPTER XIV,"""Twenty-five--thirty-five--a man's in his prime then, they"

30021,CHAPTER XIV,newspapers. Bah! How these Christians funk death! Sixty-five--we're only
30022,CHAPTER XIV,"getting on in years. Seventy-five is just possible, though. Great hell,"
30023,CHAPTER XIV,"cat O! fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark! You'll die,"
30024,CHAPTER XIV,"and Beeton will die, and Torp will die, and Mai--everybody else will"
30025,CHAPTER XIV,"die, but I shall be alive and kicking with nothing to do. I'm very sorry"
30026,CHAPTER XIV,for myself. I should like some one else to be sorry for me. Evidently
30027,CHAPTER XIV,"I'm not going mad before I die, but the pain's just as bad as ever."
30028,CHAPTER XIV,"Some day when you're vivisected, cat O! they'll tie you down on a little"
30029,CHAPTER XIV,table and cut you open--but don't be afraid; they'll take precious good
30030,CHAPTER XIV,"care that you don't die. You'll live, and you'll be very sorry then that"
30031,CHAPTER XIV,you weren't sorry for me. Perhaps Torp will come back or... I wish I
30032,CHAPTER XIV,"could go to Torp and the Nilghai, even though I were in their way."""
30033,CHAPTER XIV,
30034,CHAPTER XIV,"Pussy left the room before the speech was ended, and Alf, as he entered,"
30035,CHAPTER XIV,found Dick addressing the empty hearth-rug.
30036,CHAPTER XIV,
30037,CHAPTER XIV,"""There's a letter for you, sir,"" he said. ""Perhaps you'd like me to read"
30038,CHAPTER XIV,"it."""
30039,CHAPTER XIV,
30040,CHAPTER XIV,"""Lend it to me for a minute and I'll tell you."""
30041,CHAPTER XIV,
30042,CHAPTER XIV,The outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not
30043,CHAPTER XIV,over-steady. It was within the limits of human possibility that--that
30044,CHAPTER XIV,was no letter from Maisie. He knew the heft of three closed envelopes
30045,CHAPTER XIV,only too well. It was a foolish hope that the girl should write to
30046,CHAPTER XIV,"him, for he did not realise that there is a wrong which admits of no"
30047,CHAPTER XIV,reparation though the evildoer may with tears and the heart's best love
30048,CHAPTER XIV,strive to mend all. It is best to forget that wrong whether it be caused
30049,CHAPTER XIV,"or endured, since it is as remediless as bad work once put forward."
30050,CHAPTER XIV,
30051,CHAPTER XIV,"""Read it, then,"" said Dick, and Alf began intoning according to the"
30052,CHAPTER XIV,"rules of the Board School--""'I could have given you love, I could have"
30053,CHAPTER XIV,"given you loyalty, such as you never dreamed of. Do you suppose I cared"
30054,CHAPTER XIV,what you were? But you chose to whistle everything down the wind for
30055,CHAPTER XIV,"nothing. My only excuse for you is that you are so young.' That's all,"""
30056,CHAPTER XIV,"he said, returning the paper to be dropped into the fire."
30057,CHAPTER XIV,
30058,CHAPTER XIV,"""What was in the letter?"" asked Mrs. Beeton, when Alf returned."
30059,CHAPTER XIV,
30060,CHAPTER XIV,"""I don't know. I think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin'"
30061,CHAPTER XIV,"at everything when you're young."""
30062,CHAPTER XIV,
30063,CHAPTER XIV,"""I must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about and"
30064,CHAPTER XIV,"it has bounced up and hit me. God help it, whatever it is--unless it was"
30065,CHAPTER XIV,all a joke. But I don't know any one who'd take the trouble to play a
30066,CHAPTER XIV,joke on me--Love and loyalty for nothing. It sounds tempting enough. I
30067,CHAPTER XIV,"wonder whether I have lost anything really?"""
30068,CHAPTER XIV,
30069,CHAPTER XIV,Dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he
30070,CHAPTER XIV,had put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a woman's hands.
30071,CHAPTER XIV,
30072,CHAPTER XIV,"Still, the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think"
30073,CHAPTER XIV,about stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night.
30074,CHAPTER XIV,"When his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more,"
30075,CHAPTER XIV,body and soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the
30076,CHAPTER XIV,darkness.
30077,CHAPTER XIV,
30078,CHAPTER XIV,Then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light
30079,CHAPTER XIV,again. But there was no light to be reached. When that agony had left
30080,CHAPTER XIV,"him sweating and breathless, the downward flight would recommence till"
30081,CHAPTER XIV,the gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless
30082,CHAPTER XIV,as the first. Followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed
30083,CHAPTER XIV,that he saw. Then the procession of events would repeat itself till he
30084,CHAPTER XIV,was utterly worn out and the brain took up its everlasting consideration
30085,CHAPTER XIV,of Maisie and might-have-beens.
30086,CHAPTER XIV,
30087,CHAPTER XIV,At the end of everything Mr. Beeton came to his room and volunteered to
30088,CHAPTER XIV,"take him out. ""Not marketing this time, but we'll go into the Parks if"
30089,CHAPTER XIV,"you like."""
30090,CHAPTER XIV,
30091,CHAPTER XIV,"""Be damned if I do,"" quoth Dick. ""Keep to the streets and walk up and"
30092,CHAPTER XIV,"down. I like to hear the people round me."""
30093,CHAPTER XIV,
30094,CHAPTER XIV,This was not altogether true. The blind in the first stages of their
30095,CHAPTER XIV,infirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted
30096,CHAPTER XIV,arms--but Dick had no earthly desire to go to the Parks. Once and
30097,CHAPTER XIV,only once since Maisie had shut her door he had gone there under Alf's
30098,CHAPTER XIV,charge. Alf forgot him and fished for minnows in the Serpentine with
30099,CHAPTER XIV,"some companions. After half an hour's waiting Dick, almost weeping with"
30100,CHAPTER XIV,"rage and wrath, caught a passer-by, who introduced him to a friendly"
30101,CHAPTER XIV,"policeman, who led him to a four-wheeler opposite the Albert Hall. He"
30102,CHAPTER XIV,"never told Mr. Beeton of Alf's forgetfulness, but... this was not the"
30103,CHAPTER XIV,manner in which he was used to walk the Parks aforetime.
30104,CHAPTER XIV,
30105,CHAPTER XIV,"""What streets would you like to walk down, then?"" said Mr. Beeton,"
30106,CHAPTER XIV,sympathetically. His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking
30107,CHAPTER XIV,"on the grass of Green Park with his family, and half a dozen paper bags"
30108,CHAPTER XIV,full of food.
30109,CHAPTER XIV,
30110,CHAPTER XIV,"""Keep to the river,"" said Dick, and they kept to the river, and the rush"
30111,CHAPTER XIV,of it was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and struck
30112,CHAPTER XIV,"thence on to the Waterloo Road, Mr. Beeton explaining the beauties of"
30113,CHAPTER XIV,the scenery as he went on.
30114,CHAPTER XIV,
30115,CHAPTER XIV,"""And walking on the other side of the pavement,"" said he, ""unless I'm"
30116,CHAPTER XIV,"much mistaken, is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to"
30117,CHAPTER XIV,"be drawed. I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name, except"
30118,CHAPTER XIV,"paying tenants, 'o course!"""
30119,CHAPTER XIV,
30120,CHAPTER XIV,"""Stop her,"" said Dick. ""It's Bessie Broke. Tell her I'd like to speak to"
30121,CHAPTER XIV,"her again. Quick, man!"""
30122,CHAPTER XIV,
30123,CHAPTER XIV,Mr. Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and
30124,CHAPTER XIV,arrested Bessie then on her way northward. She recognised him as the
30125,CHAPTER XIV,man in authority who used to glare at her when she passed up Dick's
30126,CHAPTER XIV,"staircase, and her first impulse was to run."
30127,CHAPTER XIV,
30128,CHAPTER XIV,"""Wasn't you Mr. Heldar's model?"" said Mr. Beeton, planting himself in"
30129,CHAPTER XIV,"front of her. ""You was. He's on the other side of the road and he'd like"
30130,CHAPTER XIV,"to see you."""
30131,CHAPTER XIV,
30132,CHAPTER XIV,"""Why?"" said Bessie, faintly. She remembered--indeed had never for long"
30133,CHAPTER XIV,forgotten--an affair connected with a newly finished picture.
30134,CHAPTER XIV,
30135,CHAPTER XIV,"""Because he has asked me to do so, and because he's most particular"
30136,CHAPTER XIV,"blind."""
30137,CHAPTER XIV,
30138,CHAPTER XIV,"""Drunk?"""
30139,CHAPTER XIV,
30140,CHAPTER XIV,"""No. 'Orspital blind. He can't see. That's him over there."""
30141,CHAPTER XIV,
30142,CHAPTER XIV,Dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as Mr. Beeton pointed
30143,CHAPTER XIV,"him out--a stub-bearded, bowed creature wearing a dirty magenta-coloured"
30144,CHAPTER XIV,neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat. There was nothing to fear from such
30145,CHAPTER XIV,"an one. Even if he chased her, Bessie thought, he could not follow far."
30146,CHAPTER XIV,"She crossed over, and Dick's face lighted up. It was long since a woman"
30147,CHAPTER XIV,of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to him.
30148,CHAPTER XIV,
30149,CHAPTER XIV,"""I hope you're well, Mr. Heldar?"" said Bessie, a little puzzled. Mr."
30150,CHAPTER XIV,Beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly.
30151,CHAPTER XIV,
30152,CHAPTER XIV,"""I'm very well indeed, and, by Jove! I'm glad to see--hear you, I mean,"
30153,CHAPTER XIV,Bess. You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after
30154,CHAPTER XIV,you got your money. I don't know why you should. Are you going anywhere
30155,CHAPTER XIV,"in particular just now?"""
30156,CHAPTER XIV,
30157,CHAPTER XIV,"""I was going for a walk,"" said Bessie."
30158,CHAPTER XIV,
30159,CHAPTER XIV,"""Not the old business?"" Dick spoke under his breath."
30160,CHAPTER XIV,
30161,CHAPTER XIV,"""Lor, no! I paid my premium""--Bessie was very proud of that word--""for a"
30162,CHAPTER XIV,"barmaid, sleeping in, and I'm at the bar now quite respectable. Indeed I"
30163,CHAPTER XIV,"am."""
30164,CHAPTER XIV,
30165,CHAPTER XIV,Mr. Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human
30166,CHAPTER XIV,nature. Therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his
30167,CHAPTER XIV,gas-plugs without a word of apology. Bessie watched the flight with a
30168,CHAPTER XIV,certain uneasiness; but so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the
30169,CHAPTER XIV,harm that had been done to him...
30170,CHAPTER XIV,
30171,CHAPTER XIV,"""It's hard work pulling the beer-handles,"" she went on, ""and they've got"
30172,CHAPTER XIV,"one of them penny-in-the-slot cash-machines, so if you get wrong by a"

30182,CHAPTER XIV,saw.
30183,CHAPTER XIV,
30184,CHAPTER XIV,"""It isn't taking you out of your way?"" he said hesitatingly. ""I can ask"
30185,CHAPTER XIV,"a policeman if it is."""
30186,CHAPTER XIV,
30187,CHAPTER XIV,"""Not at all. I come on at seven and I'm off at four. That's easy hours."""

30189,CHAPTER XIV,"""Good God!--but I'm on all the time. I wish I had some work to do too."
30190,CHAPTER XIV,"Let's go home, Bess."""
30191,CHAPTER XIV,
30192,CHAPTER XIV,"He turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk, recoiling with an"
30193,CHAPTER XIV,oath. Bessie took his arm and said nothing--as she had said nothing when
30194,CHAPTER XIV,he had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light. They
30195,CHAPTER XIV,"walked for some time in silence, the girl steering him deftly through"
30196,CHAPTER XIV,the crowd.
30197,CHAPTER XIV,
30198,CHAPTER XIV,"""And where's--where's Mr. Torpenhow?"" she inquired at last."

30210,CHAPTER XIV,Dick's patch till they came to the chambers.
30211,CHAPTER XIV,
30212,CHAPTER XIV,"""We'll have tea and muffins,"" he said joyously. ""I can't tell you,"
30213,CHAPTER XIV,"Bessie, how glad I am to find you again. What made you go away so"

30215,CHAPTER XIV,
30216,CHAPTER XIV,"""I didn't think you'd want me any more,"" she said, emboldened by his"

30221,CHAPTER XIV,

30223,CHAPTER XIV,shut the door of the studio.

30320,CHAPTER XIV,"""I had no intention of doing such, I do assure you."""
30321,CHAPTER XIV,
30322,CHAPTER XIV,"Bessie made no answer whatever. This, she knew, was the way in"

30326,CHAPTER XIV,
30327,CHAPTER XIV,Her eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and
30328,CHAPTER XIV,displeased. There were droppings of food all down the front of his
30329,CHAPTER XIV,coat; the mouth under the ragged ill-grown beard drooped sullenly; the
30330,CHAPTER XIV,forehead was lined and contracted; and on the lean temples the hair was
30331,CHAPTER XIV,a dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called
30332,CHAPTER XIV,gray. The utter misery and self-abandonment of the man appealed to
30333,CHAPTER XIV,"her, and at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was"
30334,CHAPTER XIV,humbled and brought low who had once humbled her.

30388,CHAPTER XIV,
30389,CHAPTER XIV,"""Oh, I'm sorry for you. I'm that sorry for you!"" she cried impulsively,"

30391,CHAPTER XIV,"kiss--she was the only woman who had taken pity on him, and he was not"
30392,CHAPTER XIV,too proud for a little pity now. She stood up to go.

30394,CHAPTER XIV,"""Nothing 'o that kind till you look more like a gentleman. It's quite"

30396,CHAPTER XIV,
30397,CHAPTER XIV,He could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say good-bye. She
30398,CHAPTER XIV,"passed behind him, kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck, and"
30399,CHAPTER XIV,ran away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the Melancolia.

30409,CHAPTER XIV,
30410,CHAPTER XIV,Dick was not grateful to Bessie for her parting gift. He was acutely
30411,CHAPTER XIV,"conscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night, but it"
30412,CHAPTER XIV,"seemed, among very many other things, to enforce the wisdom of getting"
30413,CHAPTER XIV,shaved.
30414,CHAPTER XIV,
30415,CHAPTER XIV,"He was shaved accordingly in the morning, and felt the better for it. A"
30416,CHAPTER XIV,"fresh suit of clothes, white linen, and the knowledge that some one in"
30417,CHAPTER XIV,the world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance made
30418,CHAPTER XIV,him carry himself almost upright; for the brain was relieved for a while
30419,CHAPTER XIV,"from thinking of Maisie, who, under other circumstances, might have"
30420,CHAPTER XIV,given that kiss and a million others.

30422,CHAPTER XIV,"""Let us consider,"" said he, after lunch. ""The girl can't care, and it's"

30437,CHAPTER XIV,
30438,CHAPTER XIV,Something cried aloud within him:--This will hurt more than anything

30441,CHAPTER XIV,
30442,CHAPTER XIV,"""I know it, I know it!"" Dick cried, clenching his hands despairingly;"
30443,CHAPTER XIV,"""but, good heavens! is a poor blind beggar never to get anything out of"
30444,CHAPTER XIV,his life except three meals a day and a greasy waistcoat? I wish she'd

30446,CHAPTER XIV,
30447,CHAPTER XIV,"Early in the afternoon time she came, because there was no young man in"
30448,CHAPTER XIV,"her life just then, and she thought of material advantages which would"
30449,CHAPTER XIV,allow her to be idle for the rest of her days.
30450,CHAPTER XIV,
30451,CHAPTER XIV,"""I shouldn't have known you,"" she said approvingly. ""You look as you"

30504,CHAPTER XIV,

30507,CHAPTER XIV,"taken between them,--why then... He pressed the girl more closely to"
30508,CHAPTER XIV,himself because the pain whipped him. She was wondering how to explain
30509,CHAPTER XIV,"a little accident to the Melancolia. At any rate, if this man really"
30510,CHAPTER XIV,desired the solace of her company--and certainly he would relapse into
30511,CHAPTER XIV,his original slough if she withdrew it--he would not be more than just a

30513,CHAPTER XIV,
30514,CHAPTER XIV,"It would be delightful at least to see what would happen, and by"
30515,CHAPTER XIV,her teachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his

30518,CHAPTER XIV,"She laughed nervously, and slipped out of his reach."
30519,CHAPTER XIV,
30520,CHAPTER XIV,"""I shouldn't worrit about that picture if I was you,"" she began, in the"

30534,CHAPTER XIV,
30535,CHAPTER XIV,"Then she began to repent very much indeed, because she knew the value of"
30536,CHAPTER XIV,"money. Still, it was probable that the blind man was overestimating the"
30537,CHAPTER XIV,"value of his work. Gentlemen, she knew, were absurdly particular about"
30538,CHAPTER XIV,their things. She giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries

30571,CHAPTER XIV,"""Hit you! No! Let's think."""
30572,CHAPTER XIV,
30573,CHAPTER XIV,He did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the
30574,CHAPTER XIV,carpet.
30575,CHAPTER XIV,
30576,CHAPTER XIV,Then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash of the
30577,CHAPTER XIV,stock-whip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the shambles
30578,CHAPTER XIV,that he would escape. For weeks he had forced himself not to think of
30579,CHAPTER XIV,"the Melancolia, because she was a part of his dead life. With Bessie's"
30580,CHAPTER XIV,"return and certain new prospects that had developed themselves, the"
30581,CHAPTER XIV,Melancolia--lovelier in his imagination than she had ever been on
30582,CHAPTER XIV,canvas--reappeared. By her aid he might have procured more money
30583,CHAPTER XIV,"wherewith to amuse Bess and to forget Maisie, as well as another"
30584,CHAPTER XIV,"taste of an almost forgotten success. Now, thanks to a vicious little"
30585,CHAPTER XIV,"housemaid's folly, there was nothing to look for--not even the hope that"
30586,CHAPTER XIV,he might some day take an abiding interest in the housemaid. Worst of
30587,CHAPTER XIV,"all, he had been made to appear ridiculous in Maisie's eyes. A woman"
30588,CHAPTER XIV,will forgive the man who has ruined her life's work so long as he gives
30589,CHAPTER XIV,"her love; a man may forgive those who ruin the love of his life, but he"
30590,CHAPTER XIV,will never forgive the destruction of his work.
30591,CHAPTER XIV,
30592,CHAPTER XIV,"""Tck--tck--tck,"" said Dick between his teeth, and then laughed softly."
30593,CHAPTER XIV,"""It's an omen, Bessie, and--a good many things considered, it serves me"
30594,CHAPTER XIV,right for doing what I have done. By Jove! that accounts for Maisie's
30595,CHAPTER XIV,running away. She must have thought me perfectly mad--small blame to
30596,CHAPTER XIV,"her! The whole picture ruined, isn't it so? What made you do it?"""
30597,CHAPTER XIV,
30598,CHAPTER XIV,"""Because I was that angry. I'm not angry now--I'm awful sorry."""

30602,CHAPTER XIV,
30603,CHAPTER XIV,"""What mistake?"""
30604,CHAPTER XIV,
30605,CHAPTER XIV,"""Something you wouldn't understand, dear. Great heavens! to think that"

30609,CHAPTER XIV,"""I ain't a piece of dirt, and you shouldn't call me so! I did it 'cause"

30612,CHAPTER XIV,"""Exactly--because I'm blind. There's noting like tact in little things."""
30613,CHAPTER XIV,
30614,CHAPTER XIV,Bessie began to sob. She did not like being shackled against her will;
30615,CHAPTER XIV,"she was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it, and was sorry too"
30616,CHAPTER XIV,that her great revenge had only made Dick laugh.
30617,CHAPTER XIV,
30618,CHAPTER XIV,"""Don't cry,"" he said, and took her into his arms. ""You only did what you"

30625,CHAPTER XIV,"Be quiet for a minute."""
30626,CHAPTER XIV,
30627,CHAPTER XIV,Bessie remained in his arms shrinking. Dick's first thought was
30628,CHAPTER XIV,"connected with Maisie, and it hurt him as white-hot iron hurts an open"
30629,CHAPTER XIV,sore.
30630,CHAPTER XIV,
30631,CHAPTER XIV,Not for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman.
30632,CHAPTER XIV,
30633,CHAPTER XIV,The first pang--the first sense of things lost is but the prelude to
30634,CHAPTER XIV,"the play, for the very just Providence who delights in causing pain has"
30635,CHAPTER XIV,"decreed that the agony shall return, and that in the midst of keenest"
30636,CHAPTER XIV,pleasure.
30637,CHAPTER XIV,
30638,CHAPTER XIV,They know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by
30639,CHAPTER XIV,"the love of their life, and in their new wives' arms are compelled to"
30640,CHAPTER XIV,realise it.
30641,CHAPTER XIV,
30642,CHAPTER XIV,"It is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone,"
30643,CHAPTER XIV,so long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work. When that
30644,CHAPTER XIV,resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone.
30645,CHAPTER XIV,
30646,CHAPTER XIV,These things and some others Dick considered while he was holding Bessie
30647,CHAPTER XIV,to his heart.
30648,CHAPTER XIV,
30649,CHAPTER XIV,"""Though you mayn't know it,"" he said, raising his head, ""the Lord is a"
30650,CHAPTER XIV,"just and a terrible God, Bess; with a very strong sense of humour. It"

30866,CHAPTER XIV,the sheet and began again with the caution about the handwriting.
30867,CHAPTER XIV,"Then: ""I leave all the money I possess in the world to""--here followed"
30868,CHAPTER XIV,"Maisie's name, and the names of the two banks that held the money."

30877,CHAPTER XIV,
30878,CHAPTER XIV,No one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a year's accumulation
30879,CHAPTER XIV,"of bills, letters, and dockets can make. Dick stuffed into the stove"
30880,CHAPTER XIV,every document in the studio--saving only three unopened letters;

30899,CHAPTER XIV,
30900,CHAPTER XIV,There remained only to leave the little will in safe hands: that could
30901,CHAPTER XIV,not be accomplished til tomorrow. Dick groped about the floor picking
30902,CHAPTER XIV,"up the last pieces of paper, assured himself again and again that there"
30903,CHAPTER XIV,"remained no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk,"
30904,CHAPTER XIV,and sat down before the stove till the fire died out and the contracting

30937,CHAPTER XV,
30938,CHAPTER XV,Bess found Dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of
30939,CHAPTER XV,"leavetakers and weeping relatives. Then he kissed her, and laid himself"
30940,CHAPTER XV,down in his bunk until the decks should be clear. He who had taken so
30941,CHAPTER XV,long to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography
30942,CHAPTER XV,"of a ship, and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine"
30943,CHAPTER XV,to him.
30944,CHAPTER XV,
30945,CHAPTER XV,Before the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been
30946,CHAPTER XV,"introduced to the head-steward, had royally tipped him, secured a good"
30947,CHAPTER XV,"place at table, opened out his baggage, and settled himself down with"
30948,CHAPTER XV,joy in the cabin. It was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved
30949,CHAPTER XV,"about, for he knew everything so well. Then God was very kind: a deep"
30950,CHAPTER XV,sleep of weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of
30951,CHAPTER XV,"Maisie, and he slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the"
30952,CHAPTER XV,Thames and was lifting to the pulse of the Channel.
30953,CHAPTER XV,
30954,CHAPTER XV,"The rattle of the engines, the reek of oil and paint, and a very"
30955,CHAPTER XV,familiar sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance.
30956,CHAPTER XV,
30957,CHAPTER XV,"""Oh, it's good to be alive again!"" He yawned, stretched himself"
30958,CHAPTER XV,"vigorously, and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of"
30959,CHAPTER XV,the lights of Brighton. This is no more open water than Trafalgar Square
30960,CHAPTER XV,is a common; the free levels begin at Ushant; but none the less Dick
30961,CHAPTER XV,could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already. A boisterous
30962,CHAPTER XV,little cross-swell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose; and
30963,CHAPTER XV,one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new
30964,CHAPTER XV,"deck-chairs. He heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass, was"
30965,CHAPTER XV,"stung in the face by a cupful, and sniffing luxuriously, felt his way to"
30966,CHAPTER XV,"the smoking-room by the wheel. There a strong breeze found him, blew"
30967,CHAPTER XV,"his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway, and the smoking-room"
30968,CHAPTER XV,"steward, understanding that he was a voyager of experience, said that"
30969,CHAPTER XV,the weather would be stiff in the chops off the Channel and more than
30970,CHAPTER XV,"half a gale in the Bay. These things fell as they were foretold, and"
30971,CHAPTER XV,Dick enjoyed himself to the utmost. It is allowable and even necessary
30972,CHAPTER XV,"at sea to lay firm hold upon tables, stanchions, and ropes in moving"
30973,CHAPTER XV,from place to place. On land the man who feels with his hands is
30974,CHAPTER XV,patently blind. At sea even a blind man who is not sea-sick can jest
30975,CHAPTER XV,with the doctor over the weakness of his fellows. Dick told the doctor
30976,CHAPTER XV,many tales--and these are coin of more value than silver if properly
30977,CHAPTER XV,"handled--smoked with him till unholy hours of the night, and so won his"
30978,CHAPTER XV,short-lived regard that he promised Dick a few hours of his time when
30979,CHAPTER XV,they came to Port Said.
30980,CHAPTER XV,
30981,CHAPTER XV,"And the sea roared or was still as the winds blew, and the engines sang"
30982,CHAPTER XV,"their song day and night, and the sun grew stronger day by day, and"
30983,CHAPTER XV,Tom the Lascar barber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened
30984,CHAPTER XV,"hatch-grating where the cool winds blew, and the awnings were spread and"
30985,CHAPTER XV,"the passengers made merry, and at last they came to Port Said."
30986,CHAPTER XV,
30987,CHAPTER XV,"""Take me,"" said Dick, to the doctor, ""to Madame Binat's--if you know"
30988,CHAPTER XV,"where that is."""
30989,CHAPTER XV,
30990,CHAPTER XV,"""Whew!"" said the doctor, ""I do. There's not much to choose between 'em;"
30991,CHAPTER XV,but I suppose you're aware that that's one of the worst houses in the

30993,CHAPTER XV,
30994,CHAPTER XV,"""Not they. Take me there, and I can look after myself."""
30995,CHAPTER XV,
30996,CHAPTER XV,So he was brought to Madame Binat's and filled his nostrils with the
30997,CHAPTER XV,"well-remembered smell of the East, that runs without a change from the"
30998,CHAPTER XV,"Canal head to Hong-Kong, and his mouth with the villainous Lingua Franca"
30999,CHAPTER XV,of the Levant. The heat smote him between the shoulder-blades with
31000,CHAPTER XV,"the buffet of an old friend, his feet slipped on the sand, and his"

31003,CHAPTER XV,Madame Binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when Dick
31004,CHAPTER XV,entered the drinking-shop which was one source of her gains. But for a
31005,CHAPTER XV,little accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he
31006,CHAPTER XV,had ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears. Somebody opened
31007,CHAPTER XV,a bottle of peculiarly strong Schiedam. The smell reminded Dick of
31008,CHAPTER XV,"Monsieur Binat, who, by the way, had spoken of art and degradation."
31009,CHAPTER XV,

31359,CHAPTER XV,"valued their nightly amusement, and the train was an excellent mark."
31360,CHAPTER XV,
31361,CHAPTER XV,"""Is it worth giving them half a hopper full?"" the subaltern asked of the"
31362,CHAPTER XV,"engine, which was driven by a Lieutenant of Sappers."
31363,CHAPTER XV,
31364,CHAPTER XV,"""I should think so! This is my section of the line. They'll be playing"
31365,CHAPTER XV,"old Harry with my permanent way if we don't stop 'em."""
31366,CHAPTER XV,
31367,CHAPTER XV,"""Right O!"""
31368,CHAPTER XV,
31369,CHAPTER XV,"""Hrrmph!"" said the machine gun through all its five noses as the"
31370,CHAPTER XV,subaltern drew the lever home. The empty cartridges clashed on the floor
31371,CHAPTER XV,and the smoke blew back through the truck. There was indiscriminate
31372,CHAPTER XV,"firing at the rear of the train, and return fire from the darkness"
31373,CHAPTER XV,"without and unlimited howling. Dick stretched himself on the floor, wild"
31374,CHAPTER XV,with delight at the sounds and the smells.
31375,CHAPTER XV,
31376,CHAPTER XV,"""God is very good--I never thought I'd hear this again. Give 'em hell,"
31377,CHAPTER XV,"men. Oh, give 'em hell!"" he cried."
31378,CHAPTER XV,
31379,CHAPTER XV,The train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party
31380,CHAPTER XV,"went out to reconnoitre, but came back, cursing, for spades. The"
31381,CHAPTER XV,"children of the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails, and"
31382,CHAPTER XV,twenty minutes were lost in clearing it away. Then the slow progress
31383,CHAPTER XV,"recommenced, to be varied with more shots, more shoutings, the steady"
31384,CHAPTER XV,"clack and kick of the machine guns, and a final difficulty with a"
31385,CHAPTER XV,half-lifted rail ere the train came under the protection of the roaring
31386,CHAPTER XV,camp at Tanai-el-Hassan.
31387,CHAPTER XV,
31388,CHAPTER XV,"""Now, you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through,"""
31389,CHAPTER XV,"said the subaltern, unshipping the cartridge-hopper above his pet gun."
31390,CHAPTER XV,
31391,CHAPTER XV,"""It was a lark, though. I only wish it had lasted twice as long."
31392,CHAPTER XV,"How superb it must have looked from outside!"" said Dick, sighing"
31393,CHAPTER XV,regretfully.
31394,CHAPTER XV,
31395,CHAPTER XV,"""It palls after the first few nights. By the way, when you've settled"
31396,CHAPTER XV,"about your mules, come and see what we can find to eat in my tent. I'm"
31397,CHAPTER XV,Bennil of the Gunners--in the artillery lines--and mind you don't fall
31398,CHAPTER XV,"over my tent-ropes in the dark."""
31399,CHAPTER XV,
31400,CHAPTER XV,"But it was all dark to Dick. He could only smell the camels, the"
31401,CHAPTER XV,"hay-bales, the cooking, the smoky fires, and the tanned canvas of the"
31402,CHAPTER XV,"tents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, shouting for"
31403,CHAPTER XV,George. There was a sound of light-hearted kicking on the iron skin of
31404,CHAPTER XV,"the rear trucks, with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the"
31405,CHAPTER XV,mules.
31406,CHAPTER XV,
31407,CHAPTER XV,The engine was blowing off steam nearly in Dick's ear; a cold wind of
31408,CHAPTER XV,"the desert danced between his legs; he was hungry, and felt tired and"
31409,CHAPTER XV,dirty--so dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands. That was
31410,CHAPTER XV,a hopeless job; he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count
31411,CHAPTER XV,over the many times that he had waited in strange or remote places for
31412,CHAPTER XV,"trains or camels, mules or horses, to carry him to his business. In"
31413,CHAPTER XV,those days he could see--few men more clearly--and the spectacle of an
31414,CHAPTER XV,armed camp at dinner under the stare was an ever fresh pleasure to the
31415,CHAPTER XV,"eye. There was colour, light, and motion, without which no man has much"
31416,CHAPTER XV,pleasure in living. This night there remained for him only one more
31417,CHAPTER XV,journey through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how far he
31418,CHAPTER XV,"has travelled. Then he would grip Torpenhow's hand again--Torpenhow, who"
31419,CHAPTER XV,"was alive and strong, and lived in the midst of the action that had once"
31420,CHAPTER XV,made the reputation of a man called Dick Heldar: not in the least to be
31421,CHAPTER XV,"confused with the blind, bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to"
31422,CHAPTER XV,"the same name. Yes, he would find Torpenhow, and come as near to the old"
31423,CHAPTER XV,"life as might be. Afterwards he would forget everything: Bessie, who had"
31424,CHAPTER XV,"wrecked the Melancolia and so nearly wrecked his life; Beeton, who lived"
31425,CHAPTER XV,in a strange unreal city full of tin-tacks and gas-plugs and matters
31426,CHAPTER XV,that no men needed; that irrational being who had offered him love
31427,CHAPTER XV,"and loyalty for nothing, but had not signed her name; and most of all"
31428,CHAPTER XV,"Maisie, who, from her own point of view, was undeniably right in all she"
31429,CHAPTER XV,"did, but oh, at this distance, so tantalisingly fair."
31430,CHAPTER XV,
31431,CHAPTER XV,George's hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation.
31432,CHAPTER XV,
31433,CHAPTER XV,"""And what now?"" said George."
31434,CHAPTER XV,
31435,CHAPTER XV,"""Oh yes of course. What now? Take me to the camel-men. Take me to where"
31436,CHAPTER XV,the scouts sit when they come in from the desert. They sit by their
31437,CHAPTER XV,"camels, and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the"
31438,CHAPTER XV,"corners, and the men eat by their side just like camels. Take me there!"""
31439,CHAPTER XV,
31440,CHAPTER XV,"The camp was rough and rutty, and Dick stumbled many times over the"
31441,CHAPTER XV,"stumps of scrub. The scouts were sitting by their beasts, as Dick knew"
31442,CHAPTER XV,they would. The light of the dung-fires flickered on their bearded
31443,CHAPTER XV,"faces, and the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest. It was no"
31444,CHAPTER XV,part of Dick's policy to go into the desert with a convoy of
31445,CHAPTER XV,"supplies. That would lead to impertinent questions, and since a blind"
31446,CHAPTER XV,"non-combatant is not needed at the front, he would probably be forced to"
31447,CHAPTER XV,return to Suakin.
31448,CHAPTER XV,
31449,CHAPTER XV,"He must go up alone, and go immediately."
31450,CHAPTER XV,
31451,CHAPTER XV,"""Now for one last bluff--the biggest of all,"" he said. ""Peace be with"
31452,CHAPTER XV,"you, brethren!"" The watchful George steered him to the circle of the"
31453,CHAPTER XV,"nearest fire. The heads of the camel-sheiks bowed gravely, and the"
31454,CHAPTER XV,"camels, scenting a European, looked sideways curiously like brooding"
31455,CHAPTER XV,"hens, half ready to get to their feet."
31456,CHAPTER XV,
31457,CHAPTER XV,"""A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line tonight,"" said Dick."
31458,CHAPTER XV,
31459,CHAPTER XV,"""A Mulaid?"" said a voice, scornfully naming the best baggage-breed that"
31460,CHAPTER XV,he knew.
31461,CHAPTER XV,
31462,CHAPTER XV,"""A Bisharin,"" returned Dick, with perfect gravity. ""A Bisharin without"
31463,CHAPTER XV,"saddle-galls. Therefore no charge of thine, shock-head."""
31464,CHAPTER XV,
31465,CHAPTER XV,"Two or three minutes passed. Then--""We be knee-haltered for the night."
31466,CHAPTER XV,"There is no going out from the camp."""
31467,CHAPTER XV,
31468,CHAPTER XV,"""Not for money?"""
31469,CHAPTER XV,
31470,CHAPTER XV,"""H'm! Ah! English money?"""
31471,CHAPTER XV,
31472,CHAPTER XV,Another depressing interval of silence.
31473,CHAPTER XV,
31474,CHAPTER XV,"""How much?"""
31475,CHAPTER XV,
31476,CHAPTER XV,"""Twenty-five pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my"
31477,CHAPTER XV,"journey's end, and as much more into the hand of the camel-sheik here,"
31478,CHAPTER XV,"to be paid when the driver returns."""
31479,CHAPTER XV,
31480,CHAPTER XV,"This was royal payment, and the sheik, who knew that he would get his"
31481,CHAPTER XV,"commission on this deposit, stirred in Dick's behalf."
31482,CHAPTER XV,
31483,CHAPTER XV,"""For scarcely one night's journey--fifty pounds. Land and wells and"
31484,CHAPTER XV,good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days. Who
31485,CHAPTER XV,"speaks?"" said Dick."
31486,CHAPTER XV,
31487,CHAPTER XV,"""I,"" said a voice. ""I will go--but there is no going from the camp."""
31488,CHAPTER XV,
31489,CHAPTER XV,"""Fool! I know that a camel can break his knee-halter, and the sentries"
31490,CHAPTER XV,do not fire if one goes in chase. Twenty-five pounds and another
31491,CHAPTER XV,twenty-five pounds. But the beast must be a good Bisharin; I will take
31492,CHAPTER XV,"no baggage-camel."""
31493,CHAPTER XV,
31494,CHAPTER XV,"Then the bargaining began, and at the end of half an hour the first"
31495,CHAPTER XV,"deposit was paid over to the sheik, who talked in low tones to the"
31496,CHAPTER XV,driver.
31497,CHAPTER XV,
31498,CHAPTER XV,"Dick heard the latter say: ""A little way out only. Any baggage-beast"
31499,CHAPTER XV,"will serve. Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man?"""
31500,CHAPTER XV,
31501,CHAPTER XV,"""And though I cannot see""--Dick lifted his voice a little--""yet I carry"
31502,CHAPTER XV,"that which has six eyes, and the driver will sit before me. If we do not"
31503,CHAPTER XV,"reach the English troops in the dawn he will be dead."""
31504,CHAPTER XV,
31505,CHAPTER XV,"""But where, in God's name, are the troops?"""
31506,CHAPTER XV,
31507,CHAPTER XV,"""Unless thou knowest let another man ride. Dost thou know? Remember it"
31508,CHAPTER XV,"will be life or death to thee."""
31509,CHAPTER XV,
31510,CHAPTER XV,"""I know,"" said the driver, sullenly. ""Stand back from my beast. I am"
31511,CHAPTER XV,"going to slip him."""
31512,CHAPTER XV,
31513,CHAPTER XV,"""Not so swiftly. George, hold the camel's head a moment. I want to feel"
31514,CHAPTER XV,"his cheek."" The hands wandered over the hide till they found the"
31515,CHAPTER XV,"branded half-circle that is the mark of the Biharin, the light-built"
31516,CHAPTER XV,riding-camel.
31517,CHAPTER XV,
31518,CHAPTER XV,"""That is well. Cut this one loose. Remember no blessing of God comes on"
31519,CHAPTER XV,"those who try to cheat the blind."""
31520,CHAPTER XV,
31521,CHAPTER XV,The men chuckled by the fires at the camel-driver's discomfiture. He had
31522,CHAPTER XV,"intended to substitute a slow, saddle-galled baggage-colt."
31523,CHAPTER XV,
31524,CHAPTER XV,"""Stand back!"" one shouted, lashing the Biharin under the belly with a"
31525,CHAPTER XV,quirt. Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nose-string tighten in his
31526,CHAPTER XV,"hand,--and a cry went up, ""Illaha! Aho! He is loose."""
31527,CHAPTER XV,
31528,CHAPTER XV,With a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward
31529,CHAPTER XV,"toward the desert, his driver following with shouts and lamentation."
31530,CHAPTER XV,
31531,CHAPTER XV,George caught Dick's arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a
31532,CHAPTER XV,disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels.
31533,CHAPTER XV,
31534,CHAPTER XV,"""What's the row now?"" he cried."
31535,CHAPTER XV,
31536,CHAPTER XV,"""Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary,"" Dick answered, after"
31537,CHAPTER XV,the manner of a common soldier.
31538,CHAPTER XV,
31539,CHAPTER XV,"""Go on, and take care your throat's not cut outside--you and your"
31540,CHAPTER XV,"dromedary's."""
31541,CHAPTER XV,
31542,CHAPTER XV,"The outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock, and"
31543,CHAPTER XV,his driver had called him back and made him kneel down.
31544,CHAPTER XV,
31545,CHAPTER XV,"""Mount first,"" said Dick. Then climbing into the second seat and gently"
31546,CHAPTER XV,"screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companion's back, ""Go"
31547,CHAPTER XV,"on in God's name, and swiftly. Goodbye, George. Remember me to Madame,"
31548,CHAPTER XV,"and have a good time with your girl. Get forward, child of the Pit!"""
31549,CHAPTER XV,
31550,CHAPTER XV,"A few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence, hardly broken by"
31551,CHAPTER XV,the creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet. Dick
31552,CHAPTER XV,"adjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace, girthed"
31553,CHAPTER XV,"his belt tighter, and felt the darkness slide past. For an hour he was"
31554,CHAPTER XV,conscious only of the sense of rapid progress.
31555,CHAPTER XV,
31556,CHAPTER XV,"""A good camel,"" he said at last."
31557,CHAPTER XV,
31558,CHAPTER XV,"""He was never underfed. He is my own and clean bred,"" the driver"
31559,CHAPTER XV,replied.
31560,CHAPTER XV,
31561,CHAPTER XV,"""Go on."""
31562,CHAPTER XV,
31563,CHAPTER XV,"His head dropped on his chest and he tried to think, but the tenor of"
31564,CHAPTER XV,his thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy. In the half doze in
31565,CHAPTER XV,seemed that he was learning a punishment hymn at Mrs. Jennett's. He had
31566,CHAPTER XV,"committed some crime as bad as Sabbath-breaking, and she had locked him"
31567,CHAPTER XV,up in his bedroom. But he could never repeat more than the first two
31568,CHAPTER XV,lines of the hymn--
31569,CHAPTER XV,
31570,CHAPTER XV,When Israel of the Lord believed Out of the land of bondage came.
31571,CHAPTER XV,
31572,CHAPTER XV,He said them over and over thousands of times. The driver turned in the
31573,CHAPTER XV,saddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and
31574,CHAPTER XV,"ending the ride. Dick roused, struck him over the head with the"
31575,CHAPTER XV,"butt, and stormed himself wide awake. Somebody hidden in a clump of"
31576,CHAPTER XV,camel-thorn shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground. A shot was
31577,CHAPTER XV,"fired, and the silence shut down again, bringing the desire to sleep."
31578,CHAPTER XV,Dick could think no longer. He was too tired and stiff and cramped to
31579,CHAPTER XV,"do more than nod uneasily from time to time, waking with a start and"
31580,CHAPTER XV,punching the driver with the pistol.
31581,CHAPTER XV,
31582,CHAPTER XV,"""Is there a moon?"" he asked drowsily."
31583,CHAPTER XV,
31584,CHAPTER XV,"""She is near her setting."""
31585,CHAPTER XV,
31586,CHAPTER XV,"""I wish that I could see her. Halt the camel. At least let me hear the"
31587,CHAPTER XV,"desert talk."""
31588,CHAPTER XV,
31589,CHAPTER XV,The man obeyed. Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind.
31590,CHAPTER XV,It rattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased. A
31591,CHAPTER XV,handful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and
31592,CHAPTER XV,crumbled softly to the bottom.
31593,CHAPTER XV,
31594,CHAPTER XV,"""Go on. The night is very cold."""
31595,CHAPTER XV,
31596,CHAPTER XV,Those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before
31597,CHAPTER XV,the light lengthens itself into many eternities. It seemed to Dick that
31598,CHAPTER XV,he had never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at
31599,CHAPTER XV,all save jolt through the air. Once in a thousand years he would
31600,CHAPTER XV,finger the nailheads on the saddle-front and count them all carefully.
31601,CHAPTER XV,Centuries later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his
31602,CHAPTER XV,left and allow the eased arm to drop down at his side. From the safe
31603,CHAPTER XV,"distance of London he was watching himself thus employed,--watching"
31604,CHAPTER XV,critically. Yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he might
31605,CHAPTER XV,"paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon, the"
31606,CHAPTER XV,"black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop, that hand held a"
31607,CHAPTER XV,"revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collar-bone. Moreover, he"
31608,CHAPTER XV,"was in the dark, and could see no canvas of any kind whatever."
31609,CHAPTER XV,
31610,CHAPTER XV,"The driver grunted, and Dick was conscious of a change in the air."
31611,CHAPTER XV,
31612,CHAPTER XV,"""I smell the dawn,"" he whispered."
31613,CHAPTER XV,
31614,CHAPTER XV,"""It is here, and yonder are the troops. Have I done well?"""
31615,CHAPTER XV,
31616,CHAPTER XV,The camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the
31617,CHAPTER XV,pungent reek of camels in the square.
31618,CHAPTER XV,
31619,CHAPTER XV,"""Go on. We must get there swiftly. Go on."""
31620,CHAPTER XV,
31621,CHAPTER XV,"""They are moving in their camp. There is so much dust that I cannot see"
31622,CHAPTER XV,"what they do."""
31623,CHAPTER XV,
31624,CHAPTER XV,"""Am I in better case? Go forward."""
31625,CHAPTER XV,
31626,CHAPTER XV,"They could hear the hum of voices ahead, the howling and the bubbling of"
31627,CHAPTER XV,the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day.
31628,CHAPTER XV,
31629,CHAPTER XV,Two or three shots were fired.
31630,CHAPTER XV,
31631,CHAPTER XV,"""Is that at us? Surely they can see that I am English,"" Dick spoke"
31632,CHAPTER XV,angrily.
31633,CHAPTER XV,
31634,CHAPTER XV,"""Nay, it is from the desert,"" the driver answered, cowering in his"
31635,CHAPTER XV,saddle.
31636,CHAPTER XV,
31637,CHAPTER XV,"""Go forward, my child! Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an"
31638,CHAPTER XV,"hour ago."""
31639,CHAPTER XV,
31640,CHAPTER XV,The camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind
31641,CHAPTER XV,multiplied. The children of the desert had arranged that most
31642,CHAPTER XV,"uncomfortable of surprises, a dawn attack for the English troops, and"
31643,CHAPTER XV,were getting their distance by snap-shots at the only moving object
31644,CHAPTER XV,without the square.
31645,CHAPTER XV,
31646,CHAPTER XV,"""What luck! What stupendous and imperial luck!"" said Dick. ""It's 'just"
31647,CHAPTER XV,"before the battle, mother.' Oh, God has been most good to me! Only""--the"
31648,CHAPTER XV,"agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an instant--""Maisie..."""
31649,CHAPTER XV,
31650,CHAPTER XV,"""Allahu! We are in,"" said the man, as he drove into the rearguard and"
31651,CHAPTER XV,the camel knelt.
31652,CHAPTER XV,
31653,CHAPTER XV,"""Who the deuce are you? Despatches or what? What's the strength of the"
31654,CHAPTER XV,"enemy behind that ridge? How did you get through?"" asked a dozen voices."
31655,CHAPTER XV,"For all answer Dick took a long breath, unbuckled his belt, and shouted"
31656,CHAPTER XV,"from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice, ""Torpenhow!"
31657,CHAPTER XV,"Ohe, Torp! Coo-ee, Tor-pen-how."""
31658,CHAPTER XV,
31659,CHAPTER XV,A bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe
31660,CHAPTER XV,"moved very swiftly towards that cry, as the rearguard, facing about,"
31661,CHAPTER XV,began to fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around. Gradually
31662,CHAPTER XV,the scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked
31663,CHAPTER XV,white that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned
31664,CHAPTER XV,over wave-like and glided into the valleys. The soldiers in the square
31665,CHAPTER XV,"were coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view, and"
31666,CHAPTER XV,they edged forward to get beyond it. A wounded camel leaped to its feet
31667,CHAPTER XV,"and roared aloud, the cry ending in a bubbling grunt. Some one had"
31668,CHAPTER XV,cut its throat to prevent confusion. Then came the thick sob of a
31669,CHAPTER XV,man receiving his death-wound from a bullet; then a yell of agony and
31670,CHAPTER XV,redoubled firing.
31671,CHAPTER XV,
31672,CHAPTER XV,There was no time to ask any questions.
31673,CHAPTER XV,
31674,CHAPTER XV,"""Get down, man! Get down behind the camel!"""
31675,CHAPTER XV,
31676,CHAPTER XV,"""No. Put me, I pray, in the forefront of the battle."" Dick turned his"
31677,CHAPTER XV,"face to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight, but,"
31678,CHAPTER XV,"miscalculating the distance, knocked it off. Torpenhow saw that his hair"
31679,CHAPTER XV,"was gray on the temples, and that his face was the face of an old man."
31680,CHAPTER XV,
31681,CHAPTER XV,"""Come down, you damned fool! Dickie, come off!"""
31682,CHAPTER XV,
31683,CHAPTER XV,"And Dick came obediently, but as a tree falls, pitching sideways from"
31684,CHAPTER XV,the Bisharin's saddle at Torpenhow's feet. His luck had held to the
31685,CHAPTER XV,"last, even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head."
31686,CHAPTER XV,
31687,CHAPTER XV,"Torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel, with Dick's body in his"

31763,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss THREEGAN. (Extracting long lavender silk stocking from the

31765,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31766,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss D. Oh, do be sympathetic, Minnie! I'm sure he does. At least I"
31767,POOR DEAR MAMMA,would be sure if he wasn't always riding with that odious Mrs. Hagan.
31768,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31769,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. I suppose so. How does one manage to dance through one's heels
31770,POOR DEAR MAMMA,first? Look at this--isn't it shameful? (Spreads stocking-heel on open
31771,POOR DEAR MAMMA,hand for inspection.)
31772,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31773,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss D. Never mind that! You can't mend it. Help me with this hateful
31774,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"bodice. I've run the string so, and I've run the string so, and I can't"
31775,POOR DEAR MAMMA,make the fulness come right. Where would you put this? (Waves lilies of
31776,POOR DEAR MAMMA,the valley.)
31777,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31778,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. As high up on the shoulder as possible.
31779,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31780,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss D. Am I quite tall enough? I know it makes May Older look lopsided.
31781,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31782,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. Yes, but May hasn't your shoulders. Hers are like a hock-bottle."
31783,POOR DEAR MAMMA,

31786,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss D. (Jumping up wildly, and hunting for bodice, which she has"

31789,POOR DEAR MAMMA,bother.
31790,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31791,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Calmly.) You needn't. It isn't for us. That's Captain Gadsby.
31792,POOR DEAR MAMMA,He is going for a ride with Mamma. He generally comes five days out of

31803,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31804,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss D. You look pink. What has happened?
31805,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31806,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (In a stage whisper.) A twenty-four-inch waist, and she won't"
31807,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"let it out. Where are my bangles? (Rummages on the toilet-table, and"
31808,POOR DEAR MAMMA,dabs at her hair with a brush in the interval.)
31809,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31810,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss D. Who is this Captain Gadsby? I don't think I've met him.
31811,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31812,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. You must have. He belongs to the Harrar set. I've danced with
31813,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"him, but I've never talked to him. He's a big yellow man, just like a"
31814,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"newly-hatched chicken, with an enormous moustache. He walks like this"
31815,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"(imitates Cavalry swagger), and he goes ""Ha-Hmmm!"" deep down in his"
31816,POOR DEAR MAMMA,throat when he can't think of anything to say. Mamma likes him. I don't.
31817,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31818,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss D. (Abstractedly.) Does he wax that moustache?
31819,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31820,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Busy with Powder-puff.) Yes, I think so. Why?"
31821,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31822,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss D. (Bending over the bodice and sewing furiously.) Oh,"
31823,POOR DEAR MAMMA,nothing--only--
31824,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31825,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Sternly.) Only what? Out with it, Emma."
31826,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31827,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss D. Well, May Olger--she's engaged to Mr. Charteris, you"
31828,POOR DEAR MAMMA,know--said--Promise you won't repeat this?
31829,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31830,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. Yes, I promise. What did she say?"
31831,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31832,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss D. That--that being kissed (with a rush) with a man who didn't wax
31833,POOR DEAR MAMMA,his moustache was--like eating an egg without salt.
31834,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31835,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (At her full height, with crushing scorn.) May Olger is a"
31836,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"horrid, nasty Thing, and you can tell her I said so. I'm glad she"
31837,POOR DEAR MAMMA,doesn't belong to my set--I must go and feed this man! Do I look
31838,POOR DEAR MAMMA,presentable?
31839,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31840,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss D. Yes, perfectly. Be quick and hand him over to your Mother, and"
31841,POOR DEAR MAMMA,then we can talk. I shall listen at the door to hear what you say to
31842,POOR DEAR MAMMA,him.
31843,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31844,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. 'Sure I don't care. I'm not afraid of Captain Gadsby.

31846,POOR DEAR MAMMA,In proof of this swings into the drawing-room with a mannish stride
31847,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"followed by two short steps, which produces the effect of a restive"
31848,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"horse entering. Misses CAPTAIN GADSBY, who is sitting in the shadow of"
31849,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"the window-curtain, and gazes round helplessly."
31850,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31851,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"CAPTAIN GADSBY. (Aside.) The filly, by Jove! 'Must ha' picked up that"
31852,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"action from the sire. (Aloud, rising.) Good evening, Miss Threegan."
31853,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31854,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Conscious that she is flushing.) Good evening, Captain Gadsby."
31855,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Mamma told me to say that she will be ready in a few minutes. Won't you
31856,POOR DEAR MAMMA,have some tea? (Aside.) I hope Mamma will be quick. What am I to say to
31857,POOR DEAR MAMMA,the creature? (Aloud and abruptly.) Milk and sugar?
31858,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31859,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. No sugar, tha-anks, and very little milk. Ha-Hmmm."
31860,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31861,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Aside.) If he's going to do that, I'm lost. I shall laugh. I"
31862,POOR DEAR MAMMA,know I shall!
31863,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31864,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Pulling at his moustache and watching it sideways down his
31865,POOR DEAR MAMMA,nose.) Ha-Hmmm. (Aside.) 'Wonder what the little beast can talk about.
31866,POOR DEAR MAMMA,'Must make a shot at it.
31867,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31868,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Aside.) Oh, this is agonizing. I must say something."
31869,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31870,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Both Together. Have you Been--
31871,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31872,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. I beg your pardon. You were going to say--
31873,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31874,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Who has been watching the moustache with awed fascination.)
31875,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Won't you have some eggs?
31876,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31877,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Looking bewilderedly at the tea-table.) Eggs! (Aside.) O
31878,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Hades! She must have a nursery-tea at this hour. S'pose they've wiped
31879,POOR DEAR MAMMA,her mouth and sent her to me while the Mother is getting on her duds.
31880,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"(Aloud.) No, thanks."
31881,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31882,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Crimson with confusion.) Oh! I didn't mean that. I wasn't
31883,POOR DEAR MAMMA,thinking of mou--eggs for an instant. I mean salt. Won't you have some
31884,POOR DEAR MAMMA,sa--sweets? (Aside.) He'll think me a raving lunatic. I wish Mamma would
31885,POOR DEAR MAMMA,come.
31886,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31887,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) It was a nursery-tea and she's ashamed of it. By Jove!
31888,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"She doesn't look half bad when she colors up like that. (Aloud, helping"
31889,POOR DEAR MAMMA,himself from the dish.) Have you seen those new chocolates at Peliti's?
31890,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31891,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. No, I made these myself. What are they like?"
31892,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31893,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. These! De-licious. (Aside.) And that's a fact.
31894,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31895,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Aside.) Oh, bother! he'll think I'm fishing for compliments."
31896,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"(Aloud.) No, Peliti's of course."
31897,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31898,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Enthusiastically.) Not to compare with these. How d'you make
31899,POOR DEAR MAMMA,them? I can't get my khansamah to understand the simplest thing beyond
31900,POOR DEAR MAMMA,mutton and fowl.
31901,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31902,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. Yes? I'm not a khansamah, you know. Perhaps you frighten him."
31903,POOR DEAR MAMMA,You should never frighten a servant. He loses his head. It's very bad
31904,POOR DEAR MAMMA,policy.
31905,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31906,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. He's so awf'ly stupid.
31907,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31908,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Folding her hands in her lap.) You should call him quietly and
31909,POOR DEAR MAMMA,say: 'O khansamah jee!'
31910,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31911,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Getting interested.) Yes? (Aside.) Fancy that little
31912,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"featherweight saying, 'O khansamah jee' to my bloodthirsty Mir Khan!"
31913,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31914,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T Then you should explain the dinner, dish by dish."
31915,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31916,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. But I can't speak the vernacular.
31917,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31918,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Patronizingly.) You should pass the Higher Standard and try.
31919,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31920,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. I have, but I don't seem to be any the wiser. Are you?"
31921,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31922,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. I never passed the Higher Standard. But the khansamah is very
31923,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"patient with me. He doesn't get angry when I talk about sheep's topees,"
31924,POOR DEAR MAMMA,or order maunds of grain when I mean seers.
31925,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31926,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside with intense indignation.) I'd like to see Mir Khan
31927,POOR DEAR MAMMA,being rude to that girl! Hullo! Steady the Buffs! (Aloud.) And do you
31928,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"understand about horses, too?"
31929,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31930,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. A little--not very much. I can't doctor them, but I know what"
31931,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"they ought to eat, and I am in charge of our stable."
31932,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31933,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. Indeed! You might help me then. What ought a man to give his
31934,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"sais in the Hills? My ruffian says eight rupees, because everything is"
31935,POOR DEAR MAMMA,so dear.
31936,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31937,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. Six rupees a month, and one rupee Simla allowance--neither more"
31938,POOR DEAR MAMMA,nor less. And a grass-cut gets six rupees. That's better than buying
31939,POOR DEAR MAMMA,grass in the bazar.
31940,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31941,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Admiringly.) How do you know?
31942,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31943,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. I have tried both ways.
31944,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31945,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. Do you ride much, then? I've never seen you on the Mall."
31946,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31947,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Aside.) I haven't passed him more than fifty times. (Aloud.)
31948,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Nearly every day.
31949,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31950,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. By Jove! I didn't know that. Ha-Hmmm (Pulls at his moustache
31951,POOR DEAR MAMMA,and is silent for forty seconds.)
31952,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31953,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Desperately, and wondering what will happen next.) It looks"
31954,POOR DEAR MAMMA,beautiful. I shouldn't touch it if I were you. (Aside.) It's all Mamma's
31955,POOR DEAR MAMMA,fault for not coming before. I will be rude!
31956,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31957,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Bronzing under the tan and bringing down his hand very
31958,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"quickly.) Eh! Wha-at! Oh, yes! Ha! Ha! (Laughs uneasily.) (Aside.) Well,"
31959,POOR DEAR MAMMA,of all the dashed cheek! I never had a woman say that to me yet. She
31960,POOR DEAR MAMMA,must be a cool hand or else--Ah! that nursery-tea!
31961,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31962,POOR DEAR MAMMA,VOICE PROM THE UNKNOWN. Tchk! Tchk! Tchk!
31963,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31964,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. Good gracious! What's that?
31965,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31966,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. The dog, I think. (Aside.) Emma has been listening, and I'll"
31967,POOR DEAR MAMMA,never forgive her!
31968,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31969,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) They don't keep dogs here. (Aloud.) Didn't sound like
31970,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"a dog, did it?"
31971,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31972,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Then it must have been the cat. Let's go into the veranda. What
31973,POOR DEAR MAMMA,a lovely evening it is!
31974,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31975,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Steps into veranda and looks out across the hills into sunset. The
31976,POOR DEAR MAMMA,CAPTAIN follows.
31977,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31978,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) Superb eyes! I wonder that I never noticed them
31979,POOR DEAR MAMMA,before! (Aloud.) There's going to be a dance at Viceregal Lodge on
31980,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Wednesday. Can you spare me one?
31981,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31982,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Shortly.) No! I don't want any of your charity-dances. You only
31983,POOR DEAR MAMMA,ask me because Mamma told you to. I hop and I bump. You know I do!
31984,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31985,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. (Aside.) That's true, but little girls shouldn't understand"
31986,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"these things. (Aloud.) No, on my word, I don't. You dance beautifully."
31987,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31988,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Then why do you always stand out after half a dozen turns? I
31989,POOR DEAR MAMMA,thought officers in the Army didn't tell fibs.
31990,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31991,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. It wasn't a fib, believe me. I really do want the pleasure of a"
31992,POOR DEAR MAMMA,dance with you.
31993,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31994,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Wickedly.) Why? Won't Mamma dance with you any more?
31995,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31996,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (More earnestly than the necessity demands.) I wasn't thinking
31997,POOR DEAR MAMMA,of your Mother. (Aside.) You little vixen!
31998,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
31999,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. (Still looking out of the window.) Eh? Oh, I beg your pardon. I"
32000,POOR DEAR MAMMA,was thinking of something else.
32001,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32002,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) Well! I wonder what she'll say next. I've never known
32003,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"a woman treat me like this before. I might b--Dash it, I might be an"
32004,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Infantry subaltern! (Aloud.) Oh, please don't trouble. I'm not worth"
32005,POOR DEAR MAMMA,thinking about. Isn't your Mother ready yet?
32006,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32007,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. I should think so; but promise me, Captain Gamsby, you won't"
32008,POOR DEAR MAMMA,take poor dear Mamma twice round Jakko any more. It tires her so.
32009,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32010,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. She says that no exercise tires her.
32011,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32012,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. Yes, but she suffers afterward. You don't know what rheumatism"
32013,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"is, and you oughtn't to keep her out so late, when it gets chill in the"
32014,POOR DEAR MAMMA,evenings.
32015,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32016,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) Rheumatism. I thought she came off her horse rather
32017,POOR DEAR MAMMA,in a bunch. Whew! One lives and learns. (Aloud.) I'm sorry to hear that.
32018,POOR DEAR MAMMA,She hasn't mentioned it to me.
32019,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32020,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Flurried.) Of course not! Poor dear Mamma never would. And
32021,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"you mustn't say that I told you either. Promise me that you won't. Oh,"
32022,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Captain Gamsby, promise me you won't!"
32023,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32024,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. I am dumb, or--I shall be as soon as you've given me that"
32025,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"dance, and another--if you can trouble yourself to think about me for a"
32026,POOR DEAR MAMMA,minute.
32027,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32028,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. But you won't like it one little bit. You'll be awfully sorry
32029,POOR DEAR MAMMA,afterward.
32030,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32031,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. I shall like it above all things, and I shall only be sorry"
32032,POOR DEAR MAMMA,that I didn't get more. (Aside.) Now what in the world am I saying?
32033,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32034,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Very well. You will have only yourself to thank if your toes are
32035,POOR DEAR MAMMA,trodden on. Shall we say Seven?
32036,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32037,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. And Eleven. (Aside.) She can't be more than eight stone, but,"
32038,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"even then, it's an absurdly small foot. (Looks at his own riding boots.)"
32039,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32040,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. They're beautifully shiny. I can almost see my face in them.
32041,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32042,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. I was thinking whether I should have to go on crutches for the
32043,POOR DEAR MAMMA,rest of my life if you trod on my toes.
32044,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32045,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Very likely. Why not change Eleven for a square?
32046,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32047,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. No, please! I want them both waltzes. Won't you write them"
32048,POOR DEAR MAMMA,down?
32049,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32050,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. I don't get so many dances that I shall confuse them. You will
32051,POOR DEAR MAMMA,be the offender.
32052,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32053,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. Wait and see! (Aside.) She doesn't dance perfectly, perhaps,"
32054,POOR DEAR MAMMA,but--
32055,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32056,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Your tea must have got cold by this time. Won't you have another
32057,POOR DEAR MAMMA,cup?
32058,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32059,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Capt. G. No, thanks. Don't you think it's pleasanter out in the veranda?"
32060,POOR DEAR MAMMA,(Aside.) I never saw hair take that color in the sunshine before.
32061,POOR DEAR MAMMA,(Aloud.) It's like one of Dicksee's pictures.
32062,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32063,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss T. Yes I It's a wonderful sunset, isn't it? (Bluntly.) But what do"
32064,POOR DEAR MAMMA,you know about Dicksee's pictures?
32065,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32066,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. I go Home occasionally. And I used to know the Galleries.
32067,POOR DEAR MAMMA,(Nervously.) You mustn't think me only a Philistine with a moustache.
32068,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32069,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Don't! Please don't. I'm so sorry for what I said then. I was
32070,POOR DEAR MAMMA,horribly rude. It slipped out before j thought. Don't you know the
32071,POOR DEAR MAMMA,temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake
32072,POOR DEAR MAMMA,of saying them? I'm afraid I gave way to it.
32073,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32074,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Watching the girl as she flushes.) I think I know the feeling.
32075,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it? For instance,"
32076,POOR DEAR MAMMA,I might say--
32077,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32078,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"POOR DEAR MAMMA. (Entering, habited, hatted, and booted.) Ah, Captain"
32079,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Gamsby? 'Sorry to keep you waiting. 'Hope you haven't been bored. 'My
32080,POOR DEAR MAMMA,little girl been talking to you?
32081,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32082,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Aside.) I'm not sorry I spoke about the rheumatism. I'm not!
32083,POOR DEAR MAMMA,I'm NOT! I only wished I'd mentioned the corns too.
32084,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32085,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) What a shame! I wonder how old she is. It never
32086,POOR DEAR MAMMA,occurred to me before. (Aloud.) We've been discussing 'Shakespeare and
32087,POOR DEAR MAMMA,the musical glasses' in the veranda.
32088,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32089,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Aside.) Nice man! He knows that quotation. He isn't a
32090,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Philistine with a moustache. (Aloud.) Goodbye, Captain Gadsby. (Aside.)"
32091,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"What a huge hand and what a squeeze! I don't suppose he meant it, but he"
32092,POOR DEAR MAMMA,has driven the rings into my fingers.
32093,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32094,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Poor Dear Mamma. Has Vermillion come round yet? Oh, yes! Captain Gadsby,"
32095,POOR DEAR MAMMA,don't you think that the saddle is too far forward? (They pass into the
32096,POOR DEAR MAMMA,front veranda.)
32097,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32098,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I know what she prefers? She
32099,POOR DEAR MAMMA,told me that she doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.
32100,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32101,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. (Coming out into front veranda.) Oh! Bad Buldoo! I must speak to
32102,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"him for this. He has taken up the curb two links, and Vermillion bates"
32103,POOR DEAR MAMMA,that. (Passes out and to horse's head.)
32104,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32105,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. Let me do it!
32106,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32107,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Miss. T. No, Vermillion understands me. Don't you, old man? (Loosens"
32108,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"curb-chain skilfully, and pats horse on nose and throttle.) Poor"
32109,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Vermillion! Did they want to cut his chin off? There!
32110,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32111,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Captain Gadsby watches the interlude with undisguised admiration.
32112,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32113,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Poor Dear Mamma. (Tartly to Miss T.) You've forgotten your guest, I"
32114,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"think, dear."
32115,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32116,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Miss T. Good gracious! So I have! Goodbye. (Retreats indoors hastily.)
32117,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32118,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Poor Dear Mamma. (Bunching reins in fingers hampered by too tight
32119,POOR DEAR MAMMA,gauntlets.) CAPTAIN Gadsby!
32120,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32121,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"CAPTAIN GADSBY stoops and makes the foot-rest. Poor Dear Mamma blunders,"
32122,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"halts too long, and breaks through it."
32123,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32124,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) Can't hold up seven stone forever. It's all your
32125,POOR DEAR MAMMA,rheumatism. (Aloud.) Can't imagine why I was so clumsy. (Aside.) Now
32126,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Little Featherweight would have gone up like a bird.
32127,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32128,POOR DEAR MAMMA,They ride out of the garden. The Captain falls back.
32129,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32130,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) How that habit catches her under the arms! Ugh!
32131,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32132,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"Poor Dear Mamma. (With the worn smile of sixteen seasons, the worse for"
32133,POOR DEAR MAMMA,"exchange.) You're dull this afternoon, Captain Gadsby."
32134,POOR DEAR MAMMA,
32135,POOR DEAR MAMMA,Capt. G. (Spurring up wearily.) Why did you keep me waiting so long?

32238,GADSBY!,
32239,GADSBY!,Blayne. She's a girl--daughter of a Colonel Somebody.
32240,GADSBY!,
32241,GADSBY!,Doone. Simla's stiff with Colonels' daughters. Be more explicit.
32242,GADSBY!,
32243,GADSBY!,Blayne. Wait a shake. What was her name? Thresomething. Three--
32244,GADSBY!,
32245,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. Stars, perhaps. Caddy knows that brand."
32246,GADSBY!,
32247,GADSBY!,Blayne. Threegan--Minnie Threegan.
32248,GADSBY!,
32249,GADSBY!,Mackesy. Threegan Isn't she a little bit of a girl with red hair?
32250,GADSBY!,
32251,GADSBY!,Blayne. 'Bout that--from what from what Markyn said.
32252,GADSBY!,
32253,GADSBY!,Mackesy. Then I've met her. She was at Lucknow last season. 'Owned a
32254,GADSBY!,"permanently juvenile Mamma, and danced damnably. I say, Jervoise, you"
32255,GADSBY!,"knew the Threegans, didn't you?"

32257,GADSBY!,"JERVOISE. (Civilian of twenty-five years' service, waking up from his"

32260,GADSBY!,
32261,GADSBY!,"Mackesy. The Threegan girl's engaged, so Blayne says."
32262,GADSBY!,
32263,GADSBY!,Jervoise. (Slowly.) Engaged--en-gaged! Bless my soul! I'm getting an old
32264,GADSBY!,man! Little Minnie Threegan engaged. It was only the other day I went
32265,GADSBY!,"home with them in the Surat--no, the Massilia--and she was crawling"
32266,GADSBY!,about on her hands and knees among the ayahs. 'Used to call me the
32267,GADSBY!,"""Tick Tack Sahib"" because I showed her my watch. And that was in"
32268,GADSBY!,"Sixty-Seven--no, Seventy. Good God, how time flies! I'm an old man."
32269,GADSBY!,I remember when Threegan married Miss Derwent--daughter of old Hooky
32270,GADSBY!,Derwent--but that was before your time. And so the little baby's engaged
32271,GADSBY!,to have a little baby of her own! Who's the other fool?

32273,GADSBY!,Mackesy. Gadsby of the Pink Hussars.
32274,GADSBY!,
32275,GADSBY!,"Jervoise. 'Never met him. Threegan lived in debt, married in debt,"
32276,GADSBY!,and'll die in debt. 'Must be glad to get the girl off his hands.

32278,GADSBY!,"Blayne. Caddy has money--lucky devil. Place at Home, too."

32297,GADSBY!,"Mackesy. If a man's once taken that way nothing will hold him, Do you"
32298,GADSBY!,"remember Benoit of your service, Doone? They transferred him to Tharanda"
32299,GADSBY!,"when his time came, and he married a platelayer's daughter, or something"
32300,GADSBY!,of that kind. She was the only female about the place.
32301,GADSBY!,
32302,GADSBY!,"Doone. Yes, poor brute. That smashed Benoit's chances of promotion"
32303,GADSBY!,"altogether. Mrs. Benoit used to ask ""Was you goin' to the dance this"
32304,GADSBY!,"evenin'?"""
32305,GADSBY!,
32306,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Hang it all! Gadsby hasn't married beneath him. There's no
32307,GADSBY!,"tar-brush in the family, I suppose."
32308,GADSBY!,
32309,GADSBY!,Jervoise. Tar-brush! Not an anna. You young fellows talk as though
32310,GADSBY!,the man was doing the girl an honor in marrying her. You're all too
32311,GADSBY!,conceited--nothing's good enough for you.
32312,GADSBY!,
32313,GADSBY!,"Blayne. Not even an empty Club, a dam' bad dinner at the Judge's, and"
32314,GADSBY!,a Station as sickly as a hospital. You're quite right. We're a set of
32315,GADSBY!,Sybarites.
32316,GADSBY!,
32317,GADSBY!,"Doone. Luxurious dogs, wallowing in--"
32318,GADSBY!,
32319,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Prickly heat between the shoulders. I'm covered with it. Let's
32320,GADSBY!,hope Beora will be cooler.
32321,GADSBY!,
32322,GADSBY!,"Blayne. Whew! Are you ordered into camp, too? I thought the Gunners had"
32323,GADSBY!,a clean sheet.
32324,GADSBY!,
32325,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. No, worse luck. Two cases yesterday--one died--and if we have a"
32326,GADSBY!,"third, out we go. Is there any shooting at Beora, Doone?"
32327,GADSBY!,
32328,GADSBY!,"Doone. The country's under water, except the patch by the Grand Trunk"
32329,GADSBY!,"Road. I was there yesterday, looking at a bund, and came across four"
32330,GADSBY!,poor devils in their last stage. It's rather bad from here to Kuchara.
32331,GADSBY!,
32332,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Then we're pretty certain to have a heavy go of it. Heigho!
32333,GADSBY!,I shouldn't mind changing places with Gaddy for a while. 'Sport with
32334,GADSBY!,"Amaryllis in the shade of the Town Hall, and all that. Oh, why doesn't"
32335,GADSBY!,"somebody come and marry me, instead of letting me go into cholera-camp?"
32336,GADSBY!,
32337,GADSBY!,Mackesy. Ask the Committee.
32338,GADSBY!,
32339,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. You ruffian! You'll stand me another peg for that. Blayne,"
32340,GADSBY!,"what will you take? Mackesy is fine on moral grounds. Done, have you any"
32341,GADSBY!,preference?
32342,GADSBY!,
32343,GADSBY!,"Doone. Small glass Kummel, please. Excellent carminative, these days."
32344,GADSBY!,Anthony told me so.
32345,GADSBY!,
32346,GADSBY!,Mackesy. (Signing voucher for four drinks.) Most unfair punishment.
32347,GADSBY!,I only thought of Curtiss as Actaeon being chivied round the billiard
32348,GADSBY!,tables by the nymphs of Diana.
32349,GADSBY!,
32350,GADSBY!,Blayne. Curtiss would have to import his nymphs by train. Mrs. Cockley's
32351,GADSBY!,"the only woman in the Station. She won't leave Cockley, and he's doing"
32352,GADSBY!,his best to get her to go.
32353,GADSBY!,
32354,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. Good, indeed! Here's Mrs. Cockley's health. To the only wife in"

32357,GADSBY!,OMNES. (Drinking.) A damned brave woman
32358,GADSBY!,
32359,GADSBY!,Blayne. I suppose Gadsby will bring his wife here at the end of the cold
32360,GADSBY!,"weather. They are going to be married almost immediately, I believe."
32361,GADSBY!,
32362,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Gadsby may thank his luck that the Pink Hussars are all
32363,GADSBY!,"detachment and no headquarters this hot weather, or he'd be torn"
32364,GADSBY!,from the arms of his love as sure as death. Have you ever noticed the
32365,GADSBY!,thorough-minded way British Cavalry take to cholera? It's because they
32366,GADSBY!,"are so expensive. If the Pinks had stood fast here, they would have been"
32367,GADSBY!,"out in camp a month ago. Yes, I should decidedly like to be Gadsby."
32368,GADSBY!,
32369,GADSBY!,"Mackesy. He'll go Home after he's married, and send in his papers--see"
32370,GADSBY!,if he doesn't.
32371,GADSBY!,
32372,GADSBY!,Blayne. Why shouldn't he? Hasn't he money? Would any one of us be here
32373,GADSBY!,if we weren't paupers?
32374,GADSBY!,
32375,GADSBY!,Doone. Poor old pauper! What has become of the six hundred you rooked
32376,GADSBY!,from our table last month?
32377,GADSBY!,
32378,GADSBY!,Blayne. It took unto itself wings. I think an enterprising tradesman got
32379,GADSBY!,"some of it, and a shroff gobbled the rest--or else I spent it."
32380,GADSBY!,
32381,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Gadsby never had dealings with a shroff in his life.
32382,GADSBY!,
32383,GADSBY!,"Doone. Virtuous Gadsby! If I had three thousand a month, paid from"
32384,GADSBY!,"England, I don't think I'd deal with a shroff either."
32385,GADSBY!,
32386,GADSBY!,"Mackesy. (Yawning.) Oh, it's a sweet life! I wonder whether matrimony"
32387,GADSBY!,would make it sweeter.
32388,GADSBY!,
32389,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Ask Cockley--with his wife dying by inches!
32390,GADSBY!,
32391,GADSBY!,Blayne. Go home and get a fool of a girl to come out to--what is it
32392,GADSBY!,"Thackeray says?--""the splendid palace of an Indian pro-consul."""
32393,GADSBY!,
32394,GADSBY!,Doone. Which reminds me. My quarters leak like a sieve. I had fever last
32395,GADSBY!,"night from sleeping in a swamp. And the worst of it is, one can't do"
32396,GADSBY!,anything to a roof till the Rains are over.
32397,GADSBY!,
32398,GADSBY!,Curtiss. What's wrong with you? You haven't eighty rotting Tommies to
32399,GADSBY!,take into a running stream.
32400,GADSBY!,
32401,GADSBY!,Doone. No: but I'm mixed boils and bad language. I'm a regular Job all
32402,GADSBY!,"over my body. It's sheer poverty of blood, and I don't see any chance of"
32403,GADSBY!,getting richer--either way.
32404,GADSBY!,
32405,GADSBY!,Blayne. Can't you take leave?
32406,GADSBY!,
32407,GADSBY!,Doone. That's the pull you Army men have over us. Ten days are nothing
32408,GADSBY!,in your sight. I'm so important that Government can't find a substitute
32409,GADSBY!,"if I go away. Ye-es, I'd like to be Gadsby, whoever his wife may be."
32410,GADSBY!,
32411,GADSBY!,Curtiss. You've passed the turn of life that Mackesy was speaking of.
32412,GADSBY!,
32413,GADSBY!,"Doone. Indeed I have, but I never yet had the brutality to ask a woman"
32414,GADSBY!,to share my life out here.
32415,GADSBY!,
32416,GADSBY!,Blayne. On my soul I believe you're right. I'm thinking of Mrs. Cockley.
32417,GADSBY!,The woman's an absolute wreck.
32418,GADSBY!,
32419,GADSBY!,Doone. Exactly. Because she stays down here. The only way to keep her
32420,GADSBY!,fit would be to send her to the Hills for eight months--and the same
32421,GADSBY!,with any woman. I fancy I see myself taking a wife on those terms.
32422,GADSBY!,
32423,GADSBY!,Mackesy. With the rupee at one and sixpence. The little Doones would be
32424,GADSBY!,"little Debra Doones, with a fine Mussoorie @chi-chi anent to bring home"
32425,GADSBY!,for the holidays.
32426,GADSBY!,
32427,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. And a pair of be-ewtiful sambhur--horns for Doone to wear, free"
32428,GADSBY!,"of expense, presented by--Doone. Yes, it's an enchanting prospect. By"
32429,GADSBY!,"the way, the rupee hasn't done falling yet. The time will come when we"
32430,GADSBY!,shall think ourselves lucky if we only lose half our pay.
32431,GADSBY!,
32432,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Surely a third's loss enough. Who gains by the arrangement?
32433,GADSBY!,That's what I want to know.
32434,GADSBY!,
32435,GADSBY!,Blayne. The Silver Question! I'm going to bed if you begin squabbling
32436,GADSBY!,"Thank Goodness, here's Anthony--looking like a ghost."
32437,GADSBY!,
32438,GADSBY!,"Enter ANTHONY, Indian Medical Staff, very white and tired."
32439,GADSBY!,
32440,GADSBY!,"Anthony. 'Evening, Blayne. It's raining in sheets. Whiskey peg lao,"
32441,GADSBY!,khitmatgar. The roads are something ghastly.
32442,GADSBY!,
32443,GADSBY!,Curtiss. How's Mingle?
32444,GADSBY!,
32445,GADSBY!,"Anthony. Very bad, and more frightened. I handed him over to Fewton."
32446,GADSBY!,"Mingle might just as well have called him in the first place, instead of"
32447,GADSBY!,bothering me.
32448,GADSBY!,
32449,GADSBY!,"Blayne. He's a nervous little chap. What has he got, this time?"
32450,GADSBY!,
32451,GADSBY!,Anthony. 'Can't quite say. A very bad tummy and a blue funk so far. He
32452,GADSBY!,"asked me at once if it was cholera, and I told him not to be a fool."
32453,GADSBY!,That soothed him.
32454,GADSBY!,
32455,GADSBY!,Curtiss. Poor devil! The funk does half the business in a man of that
32456,GADSBY!,build.
32457,GADSBY!,
32458,GADSBY!,Anthony. (Lighting a cheroot.) I firmly believe the funk will kill him
32459,GADSBY!,if he stays down. You know the amount of trouble he's been giving Fewton
32460,GADSBY!,for the last three weeks. He's doing his very best to frighten himself
32461,GADSBY!,into the grave.
32462,GADSBY!,
32463,GADSBY!,GENERAL CHORUS. Poor little devil! Why doesn't he get away?
32464,GADSBY!,
32465,GADSBY!,"Anthony. 'Can't. He has his leave all right, but he's so dipped he can't"
32466,GADSBY!,"take it, and I don't think his name on paper would raise four annas."
32467,GADSBY!,"That's in confidence, though."
32468,GADSBY!,
32469,GADSBY!,Mackesy. All the Station knows it.
32470,GADSBY!,
32471,GADSBY!,"Anthony. ""I suppose I shall have to die here,"" he said, squirming all"
32472,GADSBY!,across the bed. He's quite made up his mind to Kingdom Come. And I know
32473,GADSBY!,he has nothing more than a wet-weather tummy if he could only keep a
32474,GADSBY!,hand on himself.
32475,GADSBY!,
32476,GADSBY!,Blayne. That's bad. That's very bad. Poor little Miggy. Good little
32477,GADSBY!,"chap, too. I say--"
32478,GADSBY!,
32479,GADSBY!,Anthony. What do you say?
32480,GADSBY!,
32481,GADSBY!,"Blayne. Well, look here--anyhow. If it's like that--as you say--I say"
32482,GADSBY!,fifty.
32483,GADSBY!,
32484,GADSBY!,Curtiss. I say fifty.
32485,GADSBY!,
32486,GADSBY!,Mackesy. I go twenty better.
32487,GADSBY!,
32488,GADSBY!,"Doone. Bloated Croesus of the Bar! I say fifty. Jervoise, what do you"
32489,GADSBY!,say? Hi! Wake up!
32490,GADSBY!,
32491,GADSBY!,Jervoise. Eh? What's that? What's that?
32492,GADSBY!,
32493,GADSBY!,Curtiss. We want a hundred rupees from you. You're a bachelor drawing a
32494,GADSBY!,"gigantic income, and there's a man in a hole."
32495,GADSBY!,
32496,GADSBY!,Jervoise. What man? Any one dead?
32497,GADSBY!,
32498,GADSBY!,"Blayne. No, but he'll die if you don't--give the hundred. Here! Here's"
32499,GADSBY!,"a peg-voucher. You can see what we've signed for, and Anthony's man will"
32500,GADSBY!,come round tomorrow to collect it. So there will be no trouble.
32501,GADSBY!,
32502,GADSBY!,"Jervoise. (Signing.) One hundred, E. M. J. There you are (feebly). It"
32503,GADSBY!,"isn't one of your jokes, is it?"
32504,GADSBY!,
32505,GADSBY!,"Blayne. No, it really is wanted. Anthony, you were the biggest"
32506,GADSBY!,"poker-winner last week, and you've defrauded the tax-collector too long."
32507,GADSBY!,Sign!
32508,GADSBY!,
32509,GADSBY!,Anthony. Let's see. Three fifties and a seventy-two twenty-three
32510,GADSBY!,twenty--say four hundred and twenty. That'll give him a month clear at
32511,GADSBY!,"the Hills. Many thanks, you men. I'll send round the chaprassi tomorrow."
32512,GADSBY!,
32513,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. You must engineer his taking the stuff, and of course you"
32514,GADSBY!,mustn't--
32515,GADSBY!,
32516,GADSBY!,Anthony. Of course. It would never do. He'd weep with gratitude over his
32517,GADSBY!,evening drink.
32518,GADSBY!,
32519,GADSBY!,"Blayne. That's just what he would do, damn him. Oh! I say, Anthony, you"
32520,GADSBY!,pretend to know everything. Have you heard about Gadsby?
32521,GADSBY!,
32522,GADSBY!,Anthony. No. Divorce Court at last?
32523,GADSBY!,
32524,GADSBY!,Blayne. Worse. He's engaged!
32525,GADSBY!,
32526,GADSBY!,Anthony. How much? He can't be!
32527,GADSBY!,
32528,GADSBY!,Blayne. He is. He's going to be married in a few weeks. Markyn told me
32529,GADSBY!,at the Judge's this evening. It's pukka.
32530,GADSBY!,
32531,GADSBY!,Anthony. You don't say so? Holy Moses! There'll be a shine in the tents
32532,GADSBY!,of Kedar.
32533,GADSBY!,
32534,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. 'Regiment cut up rough, think you?"
32535,GADSBY!,
32536,GADSBY!,Anthony. 'Don't know anything about the Regiment.
32537,GADSBY!,
32538,GADSBY!,"Mackesy. It is bigamy, then?"
32539,GADSBY!,
32540,GADSBY!,"Anthony. Maybe. Do you mean to say that you men have forgotten, or is"
32541,GADSBY!,there more charity in the world than I thought?
32542,GADSBY!,
32543,GADSBY!,Doone. You don't look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret. You
32544,GADSBY!,bloat. Explain.
32545,GADSBY!,
32546,GADSBY!,Anthony. Mrs. Herriott!
32547,GADSBY!,
32548,GADSBY!,"Blayne. (After a long pause, to the room generally.) It's my notion that"
32549,GADSBY!,we are a set of fools.
32550,GADSBY!,
32551,GADSBY!,Mackesy. Nonsense. That business was knocked on the head last season.
32552,GADSBY!,"Why, young Mallard--"
32553,GADSBY!,
32554,GADSBY!,"Anthony. Mallard was a candlestick, paraded as such. Think awhile."
32555,GADSBY!,"Recollect last season and the talk then. Mallard or no Mallard, did"
32556,GADSBY!,Gadsby ever talk to any other woman?
32557,GADSBY!,
32558,GADSBY!,Curtiss. There's something in that. It was slightly noticeable now you
32559,GADSBY!,come to mention it. But she's at Naini Tal and he's at Simla.
32560,GADSBY!,
32561,GADSBY!,Anthony. He had to go to Simla to look after a globe-trotter relative of
32562,GADSBY!,his--a person with a title. Uncle or aunt.
32563,GADSBY!,
32564,GADSBY!,Blayne And there he got engaged. No law prevents a man growing tired of
32565,GADSBY!,a woman.
32566,GADSBY!,
32567,GADSBY!,Anthony. Except that he mustn't do it till the woman is tired of him.
32568,GADSBY!,And the Herriott woman was not that.
32569,GADSBY!,
32570,GADSBY!,Curtiss. She may be now. Two months of Naini Tal works wonders.
32571,GADSBY!,
32572,GADSBY!,Doone. Curious thing how some women carry a Fate with them. There was a
32573,GADSBY!,Mrs. Deegie in the Central Provinces whose men invariably fell away and
32574,GADSBY!,got married. It became a regular proverb with us when I was down there.
32575,GADSBY!,"I remember three men desperately devoted to her, and they all, one after"
32576,GADSBY!,"another, took wives."
32577,GADSBY!,
32578,GADSBY!,Curtiss. That's odd. Now I should have thought that Mrs. Deegie's
32579,GADSBY!,influence would have led them to take other men's wives. It ought to
32580,GADSBY!,have made them afraid of the judgment of Providence.
32581,GADSBY!,
32582,GADSBY!,Anthony. Mrs. Herriott will make Gadsby afraid of something more than
32583,GADSBY!,"the judgment of Providence, I fancy."
32584,GADSBY!,
32585,GADSBY!,"Blayne. Supposing things are as you say, he'll be a fool to face her."
32586,GADSBY!,He'll sit tight at Simla.
32587,GADSBY!,
32588,GADSBY!,Anthony. Shouldn't be a bit surprised if he went off to Naini to
32589,GADSBY!,"explain. He's an unaccountable sort of man, and she's likely to be a"
32590,GADSBY!,more than unaccountable woman.
32591,GADSBY!,
32592,GADSBY!,Doone. What makes you take her character away so confidently?
32593,GADSBY!,
32594,GADSBY!,Anthony. Primum tempus. Caddy was her first and a woman doesn't allow
32595,GADSBY!,her first man to drop away without expostulation. She justifies the
32596,GADSBY!,first transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever
32597,GADSBY!,and ever. Consequently--
32598,GADSBY!,
32599,GADSBY!,"Blayne. Consequently, we are sitting here till past one o'clock, talking"
32600,GADSBY!,"scandal like a set of Station cats. Anthony, it's all your fault. We"
32601,GADSBY!,"were perfectly respectable till you came in. Go to bed. I'm off, Good"
32602,GADSBY!,night all.
32603,GADSBY!,
32604,GADSBY!,"Curtiss. Past one! It's past two by Jove, and here's the khit coming for"
32605,GADSBY!,"the late charge. Just Heavens! One, two, three, four, five rupees to"
32606,GADSBY!,pay for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is
32607,GADSBY!,"no better than she should be. I'm ashamed of myself. Go to bed, you"
32608,GADSBY!,"slanderous villains, and if I'm sent to Beora tomorrow, be prepared to"
32609,GADSBY!,hear I'm dead before paying my card account!

32629,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32630,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,MRS. HERRIOTT. (After conversation has risen to proper pitch.) Ah!
32631,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,'Didn't see you in the crush in the drawing-room. (Sotto voce.) Where

32634,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,CAPTAIN GADSBY. (Turning from regularly ordained dinner partner and
32635,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,settling hock glasses.) Good evening. (Sotto voce.) Not quite so loud
32636,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,another time. You've no notion how your voice carries. (Aside.) So much
32637,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,for shirking the written explanation. It'll have to be a verbal one now.
32638,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Sweet prospect! How on earth am I to tell her that I am a respectable,"
32639,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,engaged member of society and it's all over between us?
32640,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32641,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,MRS. H. I've a heavy score against you. Where were you at the Monday
32642,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Pop? Where were you on Tuesday? Where were you at the Lamonts' tennis? I
32643,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,was looking everywhere.
32644,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32645,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. For me! Oh, I was alive somewhere, I suppose. (Aside.) It's for"
32646,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Minnie's sake, but it's going to be dashed unpleasant."
32647,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32648,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. Have I done anything to offend you? I never meant it if I have.
32649,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,I couldn't help going for a ride with the Vaynor man. It was promised a
32650,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,week before you came up.
32651,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32652,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I didn't know--
32653,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32654,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. It really was.
32655,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32656,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. Anything about it, I mean."
32657,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32658,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. What has upset you today? All these days? You haven't been near
32659,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"me for four whole days--nearly one hundred hours. Was it kind of you,"
32660,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Pip? And I've been looking forward so much to your coming.
32661,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32662,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Have you?
32663,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32664,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. You know I have! I've been as foolish as a schoolgirl about it.
32665,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"I made a little calendar and put it in my card-case, and every time the"

32671,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32672,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. And it hasn't brought you nearer. You seem farther away than
32673,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,ever. Are you sulking about something? I know your temper.
32674,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32675,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. No.

32683,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. (To partner.) Oh, thanks. I didn't see. (Turns right again.) Is"

32685,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32686,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. For Goodness's sake go on with your dinner! You must eat
32687,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,something. Try one of those cutlet arrangements. (Aside.) And I fancied

32693,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,I have done anything.
32694,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32695,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) If it isn't ended here there will be a ghastly scene
32696,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,some-where else. If only I'd written to her and stood the racket at long
32697,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,range! (To Khitmatgar.) Han! Simpkin do. (Aloud.) I'll tell you later
32698,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,on.
32699,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32700,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Tell me now. It must be some foolish misunderstanding, and you"
32701,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"know that there was to be nothing of that sort between us. We, of all"
32702,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"people in the world, can't afford it. Is it the Vaynor man, and don't"
32703,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,you like to say so? On my honor--
32704,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32705,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I haven't given the Vaynor man a thought.
32706,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32707,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. But how d'you know that I haven't?
32708,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32709,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) Here's my chance and may the Devil help me through
32710,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"with it. (Aloud and measuredly.) Believe me, I do not care how often or"
32711,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,how tenderly you think of the Vaynor man.
32712,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32713,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. I wonder if you mean that! Oh, what is the good of squabbling"
32714,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,and pretending to misunderstand when you are only up for so short a
32715,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"time? Pip, don't be a stupid!"
32716,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32717,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Follows a pause, during which he crosses his left leg over his right and"
32718,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,continues his dinner.
32719,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32720,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (In answer to the thunderstorm in her eyes.) Corns--my worst.
32721,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32722,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Upon my word, you are the very rudest man in the world! I'll"
32723,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,never do it again.
32724,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32725,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Aside.) No, I don't think you will; but I wonder what you will"
32726,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,do before it's all over. (To Khitmatgar.) Thorah ur Simpkin do.
32727,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32728,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Well! Haven't you the grace to apologize, bad man?"
32729,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32730,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) I mustn't let it drift back now. Trust a woman for
32731,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,being as blind as a bat when she won't see.
32732,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32733,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. I'm waiting; or would you like me to dictate a form of apology?
32734,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32735,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Desperately.) By all means dictate.
32736,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32737,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Lightly.) Very well. Rehearse your several Christian names
32738,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"after me and go on: ""Profess my sincere repentance."""
32739,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32740,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. ""Sincere repentance."""
32741,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32742,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. ""For having behaved""--"
32743,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32744,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Aside.) At last! I wish to Goodness she'd look away. ""For"
32745,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"having behaved""--as I have behaved, and declare that I am thoroughly and"
32746,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"heartily sick of the whole business, and take this opportunity of"
32747,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"making clear my intention of ending it, now, henceforward, and forever."
32748,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,(Aside.) If any one had told me I should be such a blackguard!--
32749,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32750,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Shaking a spoonful of potato chips into her plate.) That's not
32751,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,a pretty joke.
32752,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32753,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. No. It's a reality. (Aside.) I wonder if smashes of this kind
32754,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,are always so raw.
32755,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32756,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Really, Pip, you're getting more absurd every day."
32757,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32758,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I don't think you quite understand me. Shall I repeat it?
32759,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32760,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. No! For pity's sake don't do that. It's too terrible, even in"
32761,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,fur.
32762,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32763,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I'll let her think it over for a while. But I ought to be
32764,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,horsewhipped.
32765,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32766,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. I want to know what you meant by what you said just now.
32767,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32768,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Exactly what I said. No less.
32769,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32770,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. But what have I done to deserve it? What have I done?
32771,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32772,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) If she only wouldn't look at me. (Aloud and very
32773,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"slowly, his eyes on his plate.) D'you remember that evening in July,"
32774,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"before the Rains broke, when you said that the end would have to come"
32775,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,sooner or later--and you wondered for which of US it would come first?
32776,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32777,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Yes! I was only joking. And you swore that, as long as there was"
32778,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"breath in your body, it should never come. And I believed you."
32779,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32780,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Fingering menu-card.) Well, it has. That's all."
32781,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32782,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"A long pause, during which Mrs. H. bows her head and rolls the"
32783,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,bread-twist into little pellets; G. stares at the oleanders.
32784,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32785,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Throwing back her head and laughing naturally.) They train us
32786,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"women well, don't they, Pip?"
32787,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32788,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Brutally, touching shirt-stud.) So far as the expression goes."
32789,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,(Aside.) It isn't in her nature to take things quietly. There'll be an
32790,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,explosion yet.
32791,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32792,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (With a shudder.) Thank you. B-but even Red Indians allow people
32793,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"to wriggle when they're being tortured, I believe. (Slips fan from"
32794,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,girdle and fans slowly: rim of fan level with chin.)
32795,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32796,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"PARTNER ON LEFT. Very close tonight, isn't it? 'You find it too much for"
32797,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,you?
32798,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32799,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Oh, no, not in the least. But they really ought to have punkahs,"
32800,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"even in your cool Naini Tal, oughtn't they? (Turns, dropping fan and"
32801,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,raising eyebrows.)
32802,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32803,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. It's all right. (Aside.) Here comes the storm!
32804,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32805,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Her eyes on the tablecloth: fan ready in right hand.) It was
32806,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"very cleverly managed, Pip, and I congratulate you. You swore--you never"
32807,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"contented yourself with merely Saying a thing--you swore that, as far"
32808,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"as lay in your power, you'd make my wretched life pleasant for me. And"
32809,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,you've denied me the consolation of breaking down. I should have
32810,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,done it--indeed I should. A woman would hardly have thought of this
32811,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"refinement, my kind, considerate friend. (Fan-guard as before.) You have"
32812,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"explained things so tenderly and truthfully, too! You haven't spoken or"
32813,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"written a word of warning, and you have let me believe in you till the"
32814,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,last minute. You haven't condescended to give me your reason yet. No!
32815,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,A woman could not have managed it half so well. Are there many men like
32816,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,you in the world?
32817,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32818,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I'm sure I don't know. (To Khitmatgar.) Ohe! Simpkin do.
32819,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32820,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. You call yourself a man of the world, don't you? Do men of the"
32821,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,world behave like Devils when they do a woman the honor to get tired of
32822,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,her?
32823,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32824,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I'm sure I don't know. Don't speak so loud!
32825,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32826,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Keep us respectable, O Lord, whatever happens. Don't be afraid"
32827,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"of my compromising you. You've chosen your ground far too well, and I've"
32828,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"been properly brought up. (Lowering fan.) Haven't you any pity, Pip,"
32829,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,except for yourself?
32830,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32831,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Wouldn't it be rather impertinent of me to say that I'm sorry
32832,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,for you?
32833,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32834,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. I think you have said it once or twice before. You're growing
32835,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"very careful of my feelings. My God, Pip, I was a good woman once! You"
32836,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,said I was. You've made me what I am. What are you going to do with
32837,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,me? What are you going to do with me? Won't you say that you are sorry?
32838,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,(Helps herself to iced asparagus.)
32839,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32840,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. I am sorry for you, if you WANT the pity of such a brute as I"
32841,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,am. I'm awf'ly sorry for you.
32842,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32843,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. Rather tame for a man of the world. Do you think that that
32844,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,admission clears you?
32845,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32846,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. What can I do? I can only tell you what I think of myself. You
32847,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,can't think worse than that?
32848,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32849,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Oh, yes, I can! And now, will you tell me the reason of all"
32850,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,this? Remorse? Has Bayard been suddenly conscience-stricken?
32851,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32852,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Angrily, his eyes still lowered.) No! The thing has come to an"
32853,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,end on my side. That's all. Mafisch!
32854,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32855,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. ""That's all. Mafisch!"" As though I were a Cairene Dragoman. You"
32856,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,used to make prettier speeches. D'you remember when you said?--
32857,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32858,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. For Heaven's sake don't bring that back! Call me anything you
32859,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,like and I'll admit it--
32860,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32861,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. But you don't care to be reminded of old lies? If I could
32862,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"hope to hurt you one-tenth as much as you have hurt me tonight--No, I"
32863,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,wouldn't--I couldn't do it--liar though you are.
32864,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32865,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I've spoken the truth.
32866,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32867,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. My dear Sir, you flatter yourself. You have lied over the"
32868,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"reason. Pip, remember that I know you as you don't know yourself. You"
32869,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"have been everything to me, though you are--(Fan-guard.) Oh, what a"
32870,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,contemptible Thing it is! And so you are merely tired of me?
32871,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32872,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Since you insist upon my repeating it--Yes.
32873,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32874,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. Lie the first. I wish I knew a coarser word. Lie seems so
32875,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,ineffectual in your case. The fire has just died out and there is no
32876,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"fresh one? Think for a minute, Pip, if you care whether I despise you"
32877,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"more than I do. Simply Mafisch, is it?"
32878,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32879,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Yes. (Aside.) I think I deserve this.
32880,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32881,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Lie number two. Before the next glass chokes you, tell me her"
32882,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,name.
32883,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32884,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) I'll make her pay for dragging Minnie into the
32885,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,business! (Aloud.) Is it likely?
32886,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32887,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. Very likely if you thought that it would flatter your vanity.
32888,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,You'd cry my name on the house-tops to make people turn round.
32889,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32890,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I wish I had. There would have been an end to this business.
32891,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32892,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Oh, no, there would not--And so you were going to be virtuous"
32893,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"and blase', were you? To come to me and say: ""I've done with you. The"
32894,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"incident is clo-osed."" I ought to be proud of having kept such a man so"
32895,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,long.
32896,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32897,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) It only remains to pray for the end of the dinner.
32898,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,(Aloud.) You know what I think of myself.
32899,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32900,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. As it's the only person in he world you ever do think of, and as"
32901,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"I know your mind thoroughly, I do. You want to get it all over and--Oh,"
32902,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"I can't keep you back! And you're going--think of it, Pip--to throw me"
32903,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"over for another woman. And you swore that all other women were--Pip,"
32904,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"my Pip! She can't care for you as I do. Believe me, she can't. Is it any"
32905,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,one that I know?
32906,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32907,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. Thank Goodness it isn't. (Aside.) I expected a cyclone, but not"
32908,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,an earthquake.
32909,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32910,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. She can't! Is there anything that I wouldn't do for you--or
32911,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"haven't done? And to think that I should take this trouble over you,"
32912,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,knowing what you are! Do you despise me for it?
32913,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32914,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Wiping his mouth to hide a smile.) Again? It's entirely a work
32915,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,of charity on your part.
32916,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32917,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. Ahhh! But I have no right to resent it.--Is she better-looking
32918,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,than I? Who was it said?--
32919,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32920,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. No--not that!
32921,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32922,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. I'll be more merciful than you were. Don't you know that all
32923,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,women are alike?
32924,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32925,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) Then this is the exception that proves the rule.
32926,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32927,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. All of them! I'll tell you anything you like. I will, upon"
32928,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,my word! They only want the admiration--from anybody--no matter
32929,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,who--anybody! But there is always one man that they care for more than
32930,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"any one else in the world, and would sacrifice all the others to. Oh, do"
32931,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"listen! I've kept the Vaynor man trotting after me like a poodle, and he"
32932,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,believes that he is the only man I am interested in. I'll tell you what
32933,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,he said to me.
32934,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32935,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Spare him. (Aside.) I wonder what his version is.
32936,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32937,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. He's been waiting for me to look at him all through dinner.
32938,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Shall I do it, and you can see what an idiot he looks?"
32939,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32940,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. ""But what imports the nomination of this gentleman?"""
32941,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32942,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Watch! (Sends a glance to the Vaynor man, who tries vainly to"
32943,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"combine a mouthful of ice pudding, a smirk of self-satisfaction, a glare"
32944,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"of intense devotion, and the stolidity of a British dining countenance.)"
32945,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32946,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Critically.) He doesn't look pretty. Why didn't you wait till
32947,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,the spoon was out of his mouth?
32948,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32949,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. To amuse you. She'll make an exhibition of you as I've made of
32950,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"him; and people will laugh at you. Oh, Pip, can't you see that? It's"
32951,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"as plain as the noonday Sun. You'll be trotted about and told lies, and"
32952,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"made a fool of like the others. I never made a fool of you, did I?"
32953,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32954,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) What a clever little woman it is!
32955,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32956,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Well, what have you to say?"
32957,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32958,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. I feel better.
32959,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32960,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Yes, I suppose so, after I have come down to your level. I"
32961,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,couldn't have done it if I hadn't cared for you so much. I have spoken
32962,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,the truth.
32963,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32964,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. It doesn't alter the situation.
32965,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32966,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Passionately.) Then she has said that she cares for you! Don't
32967,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"believe her, Pip. It's a lie--as bad as yours to me!"
32968,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32969,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. Ssssteady! I've a notion that a friend of yours is looking at
32970,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,you.
32971,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32972,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. He! I hate him. He introduced you to me.
32973,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32974,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) And some people would like women to assist in making
32975,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"the laws. Introduction to imply condonement. (Aloud.) Well, you see, if"
32976,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"you can remember so far back as that, I couldn't, in common politeness,"
32977,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,refuse the offer.
32978,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32979,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. In common politeness I--We have got beyond that!
32980,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32981,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Aside.) Old ground means fresh trouble. (Aloud.) On my honor--
32982,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32983,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Your what? Ha, ha!"
32984,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32985,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. Dishonor, then. She's not what you imagine. I meant to--"
32986,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32987,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Don't tell me anything about her! She won't care for you, and"
32988,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"when you come back, after having made an exhibition of yourself, you'll"
32989,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,find me occupied with--
32990,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32991,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Insolently.) You couldn't while I am alive. (Aside.) If that
32992,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"doesn't bring her pride to her rescue, nothing will."
32993,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32994,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Drawing herself up.) Couldn't do it? I--(Softening.) You're
32995,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,right. I don't believe I could--though you are what you are--a coward
32996,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,and a liar in grain.
32997,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
32998,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. It doesn't hurt so much after your little lecture--with
32999,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,demonstrations.
33000,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33001,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. One mass of vanity! Will nothing ever touch you in this life?
33002,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,There must be a Hereafter if it's only for the benefit of--But you will
33003,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,have it all to yourself.
33004,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33005,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. (Under his eyebrows.) Are you certain of that?
33006,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33007,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. I shall have had mine in this life; and it will serve me right,"
33008,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33009,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. But the admiration that you insisted on so strongly a moment
33010,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"ago? (Aside.) Oh, I am a brute!"
33011,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33012,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Fiercely.) Will that console me for knowing that you will go to
33013,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"her with the same words, the same arguments, and the--the same pet names"
33014,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"you used to me? And if she cares for you, you two will laugh over my"
33015,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,story. Won't that be punishment heavy enough even for me--even for
33016,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,me?--And it's all useless. That's another punishment.
33017,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33018,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Feebly.) Oh, come! I'm not so low as you think."
33019,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33020,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Mrs. H. Not now, perhaps, but you will be. Oh, Pip, if a woman flatters"
33021,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"your vanity, there's nothing on earth that you would not tell her; and"
33022,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,no meanness that you would not do. Have I known you so long without
33023,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,knowing that?
33024,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33025,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Capt. G. If you can trust me in nothing else--and I don't see why I
33026,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,should be trusted--you can count upon my holding my tongue.
33027,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33028,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. If you denied everything you've said this evening and declared
33029,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"it was all in fun (a long pause), I'd trust you. Not otherwise. All"
33030,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"I ask is, don't tell her my name. Please don't. A man might forget: a"
33031,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,woman never would. (Looks up table and sees hostess beginning to collect
33032,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"eyes.) So it's all ended, through no fault of mine--Haven't I behaved"
33033,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"beautifully? I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly"
33034,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I? (Arranging"
33035,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,gloves and fan.) I only pray that she'll know you some day as I know you
33036,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"now. I wouldn't be you then, for I think even your conceit will be"
33037,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,hurt. I hope she'll pay you back the humiliation you've brought on me.
33038,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,I hope--No. I don't! I can't give you up! I must have something to look
33039,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"forward to or I shall go crazy. When it's all over, come back to me,"
33040,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"come back to me, and you'll find that you're my Pip still!"
33041,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33042,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"Capt. G. (Very clearly.) False move, and you pay for it. It's a girl!"
33043,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,
33044,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,Mrs. H. (Rising.) Then it was true! They said--but I wouldn't insult you
33045,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,"by asking. A girl! I was a girl not very long ago. Be good to her, Pip."
33046,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,I daresay she believes in you.

33049,THE TENTS OF KEDAR,settles into a chair as the men redistribute themselves.

33645,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. 'Can't say I've consulted 'em particularly. I care, and that's"
33646,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,enough for me.
33647,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33648,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. (Drawing nearer to him.) Yes, now--but afterward. What's that"
33649,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,little black blur on the Snows?
33650,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33651,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. A snowstorm, forty miles away. You'll see it move, as the wind"
33652,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,carries it across the face of that spur and then it will be all gone.
33653,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33654,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. And then it will be all gone. (Shivers.)
33655,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33656,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Anxiously.) 'Not chilled, pet, are you? 'Better let me get"
33657,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,your cloak.
33658,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33659,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. No. Don't leave me, Phil. Stay here. I believe I am afraid. Oh,"
33660,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"why are the hills so horrid! Phil, promise me that you'll always love"
33661,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,me.
33662,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33663,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. What's the trouble, darling? I can't promise any more than I"
33664,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,have; but I'll promise that again and again if you like.
33665,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33666,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. (Her head on his shoulder.) Say it, then--say it! N-no--don't!"
33667,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"The--the--eagles would laugh. (Recovering.) My husband, you've married a"
33668,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,little goose.
33669,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33670,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Very tenderly.) Have I? I am content whatever she is, so long"
33671,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,as she is mine.
33672,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33673,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Quickly.) Because she is yours or because she is me mineself?
33674,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33675,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Because she is both. (Piteously.) I'm not clever, dear, and I"
33676,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,don't think I can make myself understood properly.
33677,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33678,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. I understand. Pip, will you tell me something?"
33679,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33680,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. Anything you like. (Aside.) I wonder what's coming now.
33681,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33682,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. (Haltingly, her eyes lowered.) You told me once in the old"
33683,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,days--centuries and centuries ago--that you had been engaged before. I
33684,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,didn't say anything--then.
33685,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33686,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (Innocently.) Why not?
33687,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33688,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Raising her eyes to his.) Because--because I was afraid of
33689,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"losing you, my heart. But now--tell about it--please."
33690,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33691,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. There's nothing to tell. I was awf'ly old then--nearly two and
33692,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,twenty--and she was quite that.
33693,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33694,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. That means she was older than you. I shouldn't like her to have
33695,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,been younger. Well?
33696,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33697,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Well, I fancied myself in love and raved about a bit, and--oh,"
33698,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"yes, by Jove! I made up poetry. Ha! Ha!"
33699,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33700,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. You never wrote any for me! What happened?
33701,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33702,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. I came out here, and the whole thing went phut. She wrote to"
33703,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"say that there had been a mistake, and then she married."
33704,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33705,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. Did she care for you much?
33706,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33707,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. No. At least she didn't show it as far as I remember.
33708,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33709,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. As far as you remember! Do you remember her name? (Hears it and
33710,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"bows her head.) Thank you, my husband."
33711,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33712,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Who but you had the right? Now, Little Featherweight, have you"
33713,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,ever been mixed up in any dark and dismal tragedy?
33714,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33715,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. If you call me Mrs. Gadsby, p'raps I'll tell."
33716,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33717,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Throwing Parade rasp into his voice.) Mrs. Gadsby, confess!"
33718,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33719,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. Good Heavens, Phil! I never knew that you could speak in that"
33720,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,terrible voice.
33721,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33722,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. You don't know half my accomplishments yet. Wait till we are
33723,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"settled in the Plains, and I'll show you how I bark at my troop. You"
33724,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"were going to say, darling?"
33725,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33726,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. I--I don't like to, after that voice. (Tremulously.) Phil, never"
33727,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"you dare to speak to me in that tone, whatever I may do!"
33728,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33729,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. My poor little love! Why, you're shaking all over. I am so"
33730,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"sorry. Of course I never meant to upset you Don't tell me anything, I'm"
33731,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,a brute.
33732,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33733,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. No, you aren't, and I will tell--There was a man."
33734,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33735,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (Lightly.) Was there? Lucky man!
33736,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33737,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (In a whisper.) And I thought I cared for him.
33738,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33739,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. Still luckier man! Well?
33740,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33741,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. And I thought I cared for him--and I didn't--and then you
33742,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"came--and I cared for you very, very much indeed. That's all. (Face"
33743,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"hidden.) You aren't angry, are you?"
33744,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33745,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Angry? Not in the least. (Aside.) Good Lord, what have I done"
33746,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,to deserve this angel?
33747,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33748,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Aside.) And he never asked for the name! How funny men are! But
33749,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,perhaps it's as well.
33750,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33751,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. That man will go to heaven because you once thought you cared
33752,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,for him. 'Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?
33753,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33754,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Firmly.) 'Sha'n't go if you don't.
33755,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33756,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Thanks. I say, Pussy, I don't know much about your religious"
33757,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"beliefs. You were brought up to believe in a heaven and all that,"
33758,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,weren't you?
33759,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33760,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. Yes. But it was a pincushion heaven, with hymn-books in all the"
33761,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,pews.
33762,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33763,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (Wagging his head with intense conviction.) Never mind. There
33764,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,is a pukka heaven.
33765,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33766,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. Where do you bring that message from, my prophet?"
33767,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33768,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. Here! Because we care for each other. So it's all right.
33769,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33770,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (As a troop of langurs crash through the branches.) So it's all
33771,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,right. But Darwin says that we came from those!
33772,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33773,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (Placidly.) Ah! Darwin was never in love with an angel. That
33774,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"settles it. Sstt, you brutes! Monkeys, indeed! You shouldn't read those"
33775,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,books.
33776,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33777,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Folding her hands.) If it pleases my Lord the King to issue
33778,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,proclamation.
33779,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33780,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Don't, dear one. There are no orders between us. Only I'd"
33781,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"rather you didn't. They lead to nothing, and bother people's heads."
33782,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33783,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. Like your first engagement.
33784,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33785,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (With an immense calm.) That was a necessary evil and led to
33786,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,you. Are you nothing?
33787,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33788,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. Not so very much, am I?"
33789,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33790,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. All this world and the next to me.
33791,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33792,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Very softly.) My boy of boys! Shall I tell you something?
33793,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33794,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Yes, if it's not dreadful--about other men."
33795,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33796,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. It's about my own bad little self.
33797,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33798,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Then it must be good. Go on, dear."
33799,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33800,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. (Slowly.) I don't know why I'm telling you, Pip; but if ever you"
33801,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,marry again--(Interlude.) Take your hand from my mouth or I'll bite! In
33802,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"the future, then remember--I don't know quite how to put it!"
33803,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33804,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Snorting indignantly.) Don't try. ""Marry again,"" indeed!"
33805,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33806,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. I must. Listen, my husband. Never, never, never tell your wife"
33807,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,anything that you do not wish her to remember and think over all her
33808,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"life. Because a woman--yes, I am a woman--can't forget."
33809,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33810,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. By Jove, how do you know that?"
33811,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33812,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Confusedly.) I don't. I'm only guessing. I am--I was--a silly
33813,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"little girl; but I feel that I know so much, oh, so very much more than"
33814,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"you, dearest. To begin with, I'm your wife."
33815,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33816,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. So I have been led to believe.
33817,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33818,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. And I shall want to know every one of your secrets--to share
33819,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,everything you know with you. (Stares round desperately.)
33820,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33821,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. So you shall, dear, so you shall--but don't look like that."
33822,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33823,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. For your own sake don't stop me, Phil. I shall never talk to you"
33824,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"in this way again. You must not tell me! At least, not now. Later on,"
33825,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"when I'm an old matron it won't matter, but if you love me, be very good"
33826,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,to me now; for this part of my life I shall never forget! Have I made
33827,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,you understand?
33828,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33829,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. I think so, child. Have I said anything yet that you disapprove"
33830,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,of?
33831,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33832,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. Will you be very angry? That--that voice, and what you said"
33833,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,about the engagement--
33834,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33835,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. But you asked to be told that, darling."
33836,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33837,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. And that's why you shouldn't have told me! You must be the
33838,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Judge, and, oh, Pip, dearly as I love you, I shan't be able to help you!"
33839,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"I shall hinder you, and you must judge in spite of me!"
33840,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33841,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (Meditatively.) We have a great many things to find out
33842,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"together, God help us both--say so, Pussy--but we shall understand each"
33843,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,other better every day; and I think I'm beginning to see now. How in the
33844,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,world did you come to know just the importance of giving me just that
33845,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,lead?
33846,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33847,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. I've told you that I don't know. Only somehow it seemed that, in"
33848,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"all this new life, I was being guided for your sake as well as my own."
33849,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33850,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Aside.) Then Mafflin was right! They know, and we--we're blind"
33851,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"all of us. (Lightly.) 'Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't"
33852,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"we? I'll remember, and, if I fail, let me be punished as I deserve."
33853,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33854,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. There shall be no punishment. We'll start into life together
33855,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,from here--you and I--and no one else.
33856,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33857,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. And no one else. (A pause.) Your eyelashes are all wet, Sweet?"
33858,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Was there ever such a quaint little Absurdity?
33859,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33860,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. Was there ever such nonsense talked before?
33861,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33862,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Knocking the ashes out of his pipe.) 'Tisn't what we say, it's"
33863,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"what we don't say, that helps. And it's all the profoundest philosophy."
33864,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,But no one would understand--even if it were put into a book.
33865,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33866,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. The idea! No--only we ourselves, or people like ourselves--if"
33867,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,there are any people like us.
33868,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33869,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. (Magisterially.) All people, not like ourselves, are blind"
33870,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,idiots.
33871,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33872,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. (Wiping her eyes.) Do you think, then, that there are any people"
33873,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,as happy as we are?
33874,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33875,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. 'Must be--unless we've appropriated all the happiness in the
33876,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,world.
33877,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33878,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. (Looking toward Simla.) Poor dears! Just fancy if we have!
33879,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33880,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. Then we'll hang on to the whole show, for it's a great deal too"
33881,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"jolly to lose--eh, wife 'o mine?"
33882,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33883,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. O Pip! Pip! How much of you is a solemn, married man and how"
33884,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,much a horrid slangy schoolboy?
33885,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33886,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. When you tell me how much of you was eighteen last birthday and
33887,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"how much is as old as the Sphinx and twice as mysterious, perhaps I'll"
33888,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,attend to you. Lend me that banjo. The spirit moveth me to yowl at the
33889,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,sunset.
33890,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33891,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Mrs. G. Mind! It's not tuned. Ah! How that jars!
33892,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33893,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,Capt. G. (Turning pegs.) It's amazingly different to keep a banjo to
33894,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,proper pitch.
33895,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33896,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Mrs. G. It's the same with all musical instruments, What shall it be?"
33897,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33898,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"Capt. G. ""Vanity,"" and let the hills hear. (Sings through the first and"
33899,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"half of the second verse. Turning to Mrs. G.) Now, chorus! Sing, Pussy!"
33900,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
33901,THE GARDEN OF EDEN,"BOTH TOGETHER. (Con brio, to the horror of the monkeys who are settling"

33922,FATIMA,"SCENE. The GADSBYS' bungalow in the Plains. Time, 11 A. M. on a Sunday"
33923,FATIMA,"morning. Captain GADSBY, in his shirt-sleeves, is bending over a"
33924,FATIMA,"complete set of Hussar's equipment, from saddle to picketing-rope, which"
33925,FATIMA,is neatly spread over the floor of his study. He is smoking an unclean
33926,FATIMA,"briar, and his forehead is puckered with thought."
33927,FATIMA,
33928,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (To himself, fingering a headstall.) Jack's an ass. There's"
33929,FATIMA,"enough brass on this to load a mule--and, if the Americans know anything"
33930,FATIMA,"about anything, it can be cut down to a bit only. 'Don't want the"
33931,FATIMA,"watering-bridle, either. Humbug!--Half a dozen sets of chains and"
33932,FATIMA,"pulleys for one horse! Rot! (Scratching his head.) Now, let's consider"
33933,FATIMA,"it all over from the beginning. By Jove, I've forgotten the scale of"
33934,FATIMA,"weights! Never mind. 'Keep the bit only, and eliminate every boss from"
33935,FATIMA,the crupper to breastplate. No breastplate at all. Simple leather strap
33936,FATIMA,across the breast--like the Russians. Hi! Jack never thought of that!
33937,FATIMA,
33938,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (Entering hastily, her hand bound in a cloth.) Oh, Pip, I've"
33939,FATIMA,"scalded my hand over that horrid, horrid Tiparee jam!"
33940,FATIMA,
33941,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Absently.) Eh! Wha-at?
33942,FATIMA,
33943,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (With round-eyed reproach.) I've scalded it aw-fully! Aren't you
33944,FATIMA,sorry? And I did so want that jam to jam properly.
33945,FATIMA,
33946,FATIMA,Capt. G. Poor little woman! Let me kiss the place and make it well.
33947,FATIMA,(Unrolling bandage.) You small sinner! Where's that scald? I can't see
33948,FATIMA,it.
33949,FATIMA,
33950,FATIMA,Mrs. G. On the top of the little finger. There!--It's a most 'normous
33951,FATIMA,big burn!
33952,FATIMA,
33953,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Kissing little finger.) Baby! Let Hyder look after the jam.
33954,FATIMA,You know I don't care for sweets.
33955,FATIMA,
33956,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Indeed?--Pip!
33957,FATIMA,
33958,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Not of that kind, anyhow. And now run along, Minnie, and leave"
33959,FATIMA,me to my own base devices. I'm busy.
33960,FATIMA,
33961,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Calmly settling herself in long chair.) So I see. What a mess
33962,FATIMA,you're making! Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into
33963,FATIMA,the house?
33964,FATIMA,
33965,FATIMA,"Capt. G. To play with. Do you mind, dear?"
33966,FATIMA,
33967,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Let me play too. I'd like it.
33968,FATIMA,
33969,FATIMA,Capt. G. I'm afraid you wouldn't. Pussy--Don't you think that jam will
33970,FATIMA,"burn, or whatever it is that jam does when it's not looked after by a"
33971,FATIMA,clever little housekeeper?
33972,FATIMA,
33973,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I thought you said Hyder could attend to it. I left him in the
33974,FATIMA,"veranda, stirring--when I hurt myself so."
33975,FATIMA,
33976,FATIMA,Capt. G. (His eye returning to the equipment.) Po-oor little
33977,FATIMA,"woman!--Three pounds four and seven is three eleven, and that can be cut"
33978,FATIMA,"down to two eight, with just a lee-tle care, without weakening anything."
33979,FATIMA,Farriery is all rot in incompetent hands. What's the use of a shoe-case
33980,FATIMA,when a man's scouting? He can't stick it on with a lick--like a
33981,FATIMA,stamp--the shoe! Skittles--
33982,FATIMA,
33983,FATIMA,Mrs. G. What's skittles? Pah! What is this leather cleaned with?
33984,FATIMA,
33985,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Cream and champagne and--Look here, dear, do you really want to"
33986,FATIMA,talk to me about anything important?
33987,FATIMA,
33988,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. No. I've done my accounts, and I thought I'd like to see what"
33989,FATIMA,you're doing.
33990,FATIMA,
33991,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Well, love, now you've seen and--Would you mind?--That is to"
33992,FATIMA,"say--Minnie, I really am busy."
33993,FATIMA,
33994,FATIMA,Mrs. G. You want me to go?
33995,FATIMA,
33996,FATIMA,"Capt. G, Yes, dear, for a little while. This tobacco will hang in your"
33997,FATIMA,"dress, and saddlery doesn't interest you."
33998,FATIMA,
33999,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Everything you do interests me, Pip."
34000,FATIMA,
34001,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Yes, I know, I know, dear. I'll tell you all about it some day"
34002,FATIMA,when I've put a head on this thing. In the meantime--
34003,FATIMA,
34004,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I'm to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child?
34005,FATIMA,
34006,FATIMA,"Capt. G. No-o. I don't mean that exactly. But, you see, I shall be"
34007,FATIMA,"tramping up and down, shifting these things to and fro, and I shall be"
34008,FATIMA,in your way. Don't you think so?
34009,FATIMA,
34010,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Can't I lift them about? Let me try. (Reaches forward to
34011,FATIMA,trooper's saddle.)
34012,FATIMA,
34013,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Good gracious, child, don't touch it. You'll hurt yourself."
34014,FATIMA,(Picking up saddle.) Little girls aren't expected to handle numdahs.
34015,FATIMA,"Now, where would you like it put? (Holds saddle above his head.)"
34016,FATIMA,
34017,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (A break in her voice.) Nowhere. Pip, how good you are--and how"
34018,FATIMA,"strong! Oh, what's that ugly red streak inside your arm?"
34019,FATIMA,
34020,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Lowering saddle quickly.) Nothing. It's a mark of sorts.
34021,FATIMA,(Aside.) And Jack's coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried!
34022,FATIMA,
34023,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. I know it's a mark, but I've never seen it before. It runs all"
34024,FATIMA,up the arm. What is it?
34025,FATIMA,
34026,FATIMA,Capt. G. A cut--if you want to know.
34027,FATIMA,
34028,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Want to know! Of course I do! I can't have my husband cut to
34029,FATIMA,"pieces in this way. How did it come? Was it an accident? Tell me, Pip."
34030,FATIMA,
34031,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Grimly.) No. 'Twasn't an accident. I got it--from a man--in
34032,FATIMA,Afghanistan.
34033,FATIMA,
34034,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. In action? Oh, Pip, and you never told me!"
34035,FATIMA,
34036,FATIMA,Capt. G. I'd forgotten all about it.
34037,FATIMA,
34038,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Hold up your arm! What a horrid, ugly scar! Are you sure it"
34039,FATIMA,doesn't hurt now! How did the man give it you?
34040,FATIMA,
34041,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Desperately looking at his watch.) With a knife. I came
34042,FATIMA,"down--old Van Loo did, that's to say--and fell on my leg, so I couldn't"
34043,FATIMA,run. And then this man came up and began chopping at me as I sprawled.
34044,FATIMA,
34045,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Oh, don't, don't! That's enough!--Well, what happened?"
34046,FATIMA,
34047,FATIMA,"Capt. G. I couldn't get to my holster, and Mafflin came round the corner"
34048,FATIMA,and stopped the performance.
34049,FATIMA,
34050,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. How? He's such a lazy man, I don't believe he did."
34051,FATIMA,
34052,FATIMA,Capt. G. Don't you? I don't think the man had much doubt about it. Jack
34053,FATIMA,cut his head off.
34054,FATIMA,
34055,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Cut-his-head-off! ""With one blow,"" as they say in the books?"
34056,FATIMA,
34057,FATIMA,Capt. G. I'm not sure. I was too interested in myself to know much about
34058,FATIMA,"it. Anyhow, the head was off, and Jack was punching old Van Loo in the"
34059,FATIMA,"ribs to make him get up. Now you know all about it, dear, and now--"
34060,FATIMA,
34061,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. You want me to go, of course. You never told me about this,"
34062,FATIMA,though I've been married to you for ever so long; and you never would
34063,FATIMA,have told me if I hadn't found out; and you never do tell me anything
34064,FATIMA,"about yourself, or what you do, or what you take an interest in."
34065,FATIMA,
34066,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Darling, I'm always with you, aren't I?"
34067,FATIMA,
34068,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Always in my pocket, you were going to say. I know you are; but"
34069,FATIMA,you are always thinking away from me.
34070,FATIMA,
34071,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Trying to hide a smile.) Am I? I wasn't aware of it. I'm
34072,FATIMA,awf'ly sorry.
34073,FATIMA,
34074,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (Piteously.) Oh, don't make fun of me! Pip, you know what I"
34075,FATIMA,"mean. When you are reading one of those things about Cavalry, by that"
34076,FATIMA,idiotic Prince--why doesn't he be a Prince instead of a stable-boy?
34077,FATIMA,
34078,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Prince Kraft a stable-boy--Oh, my Aunt! Never mind, dear. You"
34079,FATIMA,were going to say?
34080,FATIMA,
34081,FATIMA,Mrs. G. It doesn't matter; you don't care for what I say. Only--only
34082,FATIMA,"you get up and walk about the room, staring in front of you, and then"
34083,FATIMA,"Mafflin comes in to dinner, and after I'm in the drawing-room I can"
34084,FATIMA,"hear you and him talking, and talking, and talking, about things I can't"
34085,FATIMA,"understand, and--oh, I get so tired and feel so lonely!--I don't want to"
34086,FATIMA,"complain and be a trouble, Pip; but I do indeed I do!"
34087,FATIMA,
34088,FATIMA,Capt. G. My poor darling! I never thought of that. Why don't you ask
34089,FATIMA,some nice people in to dinner?
34090,FATIMA,
34091,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Nice people! Where am I to find them? Horrid frumps! And if I
34092,FATIMA,"did, I shouldn't be amused. You know I only want you."
34093,FATIMA,
34094,FATIMA,"Capt. G. And you have me surely, Sweetheart?"
34095,FATIMA,
34096,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I have not! Pip why don't you take me into your life?
34097,FATIMA,
34098,FATIMA,"Capt. G. More than I do? That would be difficult, dear."
34099,FATIMA,
34100,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Yes, I suppose it would--to you. I'm no help to you--no"
34101,FATIMA,companion to you; and you like to have it so.
34102,FATIMA,
34103,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Aren't you a little unreasonable, Pussy?"
34104,FATIMA,
34105,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Stamping her foot.) I'm the most reasonable woman in the
34106,FATIMA,world--when I'm treated properly.
34107,FATIMA,
34108,FATIMA,Capt. G. And since when have I been treating you improperly?
34109,FATIMA,
34110,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Always--and since the beginning. You know you have.
34111,FATIMA,
34112,FATIMA,Capt. G. I don't; but I'm willing to be convinced.
34113,FATIMA,
34114,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Pointing to saddlery.) There!
34115,FATIMA,
34116,FATIMA,Capt. G. How do you mean?
34117,FATIMA,
34118,FATIMA,Mrs. G. What does all that mean? Why am I not to be told? Is it so
34119,FATIMA,precious?
34120,FATIMA,
34121,FATIMA,Capt. G. I forget its exact Government value just at present. It means
34122,FATIMA,that it is a great deal too heavy.
34123,FATIMA,
34124,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Then why do you touch it?
34125,FATIMA,
34126,FATIMA,"Capt. G. To make it lighter. See here, little love, I've one notion"
34127,FATIMA,"and Jack has another, but we are both agreed that all this equipment is"
34128,FATIMA,about thirty pounds too heavy. The thing is how to cut it down without
34129,FATIMA,"weakening any part of it, and, at the same time, allowing the trooper"
34130,FATIMA,to carry everything he wants for his own comfort--socks and shirts and
34131,FATIMA,things of that kind.
34132,FATIMA,
34133,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Why doesn't he pack them in a little trunk?
34134,FATIMA,
34135,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Kissing her.) Oh, you darling! Pack them in a little trunk,"
34136,FATIMA,"indeed! Hussars don't carry trunks, and it's a most important thing to"
34137,FATIMA,make the horse do all the carrying.
34138,FATIMA,
34139,FATIMA,Mrs. G. But why need you bother about it? You're not a trooper.
34140,FATIMA,
34141,FATIMA,Capt. G. No; but I command a few score of him; and equipment is nearly
34142,FATIMA,everything in these days.
34143,FATIMA,
34144,FATIMA,Mrs. G. More than me?
34145,FATIMA,
34146,FATIMA,Capt. G. Stupid! Of course not; but it's a matter that I'm tremendously
34147,FATIMA,"interested in, because if I or Jack, or I and Jack, work out some sort"
34148,FATIMA,"of lighter saddlery and all that, it's possible that we may get it"
34149,FATIMA,adopted.
34150,FATIMA,
34151,FATIMA,Mrs. G. How?
34152,FATIMA,
34153,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Sanctioned at Home, where they will make a sealed pattern--a"
34154,FATIMA,pattern that all the saddlers must copy--and so it will be used by all
34155,FATIMA,the regiments.
34156,FATIMA,
34157,FATIMA,Mrs. G. And that interests you?
34158,FATIMA,
34159,FATIMA,"Capt. G. It's part of my profession, y'know, and my profession is a good"
34160,FATIMA,"deal to me. Everything in a soldier's equipment is important, and if we"
34161,FATIMA,"can improve that equipment, so much the better for the soldiers and for"
34162,FATIMA,us.
34163,FATIMA,
34164,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Who's ""us""?"
34165,FATIMA,
34166,FATIMA,Capt. G. Jack and I; only Jack's notions are too radical. What's that
34167,FATIMA,"big sigh for, Minnie?"
34168,FATIMA,
34169,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Oh, nothing--and you've kept all this a secret from me! Why?"
34170,FATIMA,
34171,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Not a secret, exactly, dear. I didn't say anything about it to"
34172,FATIMA,you because I didn't think it would amuse you.
34173,FATIMA,
34174,FATIMA,Mrs. G. And am I only made to be amused?
34175,FATIMA,
34176,FATIMA,"Capt. G. No, of course. I merely mean that it couldn't interest you."
34177,FATIMA,
34178,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. It's your work and--and if you'd let me, I'd count all these"
34179,FATIMA,"things up. If they are too heavy, you know by how much they are too"
34180,FATIMA,"heavy, and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of"
34181,FATIMA,"lightness, and--"
34182,FATIMA,
34183,FATIMA,Capt. G. I have got both scales somewhere in my head; but it's hard to
34184,FATIMA,"tell how light you can make a head-stall, for instance, until you've"
34185,FATIMA,actually had a model made.
34186,FATIMA,
34187,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. But if you read out the list, I could copy it down, and pin it"
34188,FATIMA,up there just above your table. Wouldn't that do?
34189,FATIMA,
34190,FATIMA,"Capt. G. It would be awf'ly nice, dear, but it would be giving you"
34191,FATIMA,trouble for nothing. I can't work that way. I go by rule of thumb. I
34192,FATIMA,"know the present scale of weights, and the other one--the one that"
34193,FATIMA,I'm trying to work to--will shift and vary so much that I couldn't be
34194,FATIMA,"certain, even if I wrote it down."
34195,FATIMA,
34196,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I'm so sorry. I thought I might help. Is there anything else
34197,FATIMA,that I could be of use in?
34198,FATIMA,
34199,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Looking round the room.) I can't think of anything. You're
34200,FATIMA,always helping me you know.
34201,FATIMA,
34202,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Am I? How?
34203,FATIMA,
34204,FATIMA,"Capt. G. You are of course, and as long as you're near me--I can't"
34205,FATIMA,"explain exactly, but it's in the air."
34206,FATIMA,
34207,FATIMA,Mrs. G. And that's why you wanted to send me away?
34208,FATIMA,
34209,FATIMA,Capt. G. That's only when I'm trying to do work--grubby work like this.
34210,FATIMA,
34211,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Mafflin's better, then, isn't he?"
34212,FATIMA,
34213,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Rashly.) Of course he is. Jack and I have been thinking along
34214,FATIMA,the same groove for two or three years about this equipment. It's our
34215,FATIMA,"hobby, and it may really be useful some day."
34216,FATIMA,
34217,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (After a pause.) And that's all that you have away from me?
34218,FATIMA,
34219,FATIMA,Capt. G. It isn't very far away from you now. Take care the oil on that
34220,FATIMA,bit doesn't come off on your dress.
34221,FATIMA,
34222,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I wish--I wish so much that I could really help you. I believe I
34223,FATIMA,could--if I left the room. But that's not what I mean.
34224,FATIMA,
34225,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) Give me patience! I wish she would go. (Aloud.) I
34226,FATIMA,"assure you you can't do anything for me, Minnie, and I must really"
34227,FATIMA,settle down to this. Where's my pouch?
34228,FATIMA,
34229,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (Crossing to writing-table.) Here you are, Bear. What a mess you"
34230,FATIMA,keep your table in!
34231,FATIMA,
34232,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Don' ttouch it. There's a method in my madness, though you"
34233,FATIMA,mightn't think of it.
34234,FATIMA,
34235,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (At table.) I want to look--Do you keep accounts, Pip?"
34236,FATIMA,
34237,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Bending over saddlery.) Of a sort. Are you rummaging among the
34238,FATIMA,Troop papers? Be careful.
34239,FATIMA,
34240,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Why? I sha'n't disturb anything. Good gracious! I had no idea
34241,FATIMA,that you had anything to do with so many sick horses.
34242,FATIMA,
34243,FATIMA,"Capt. G. 'Wish I hadn't, but they insist on falling sick. Minnie, if"
34244,FATIMA,1 were you I really should not investigate those papers. You may come
34245,FATIMA,across something that you won't like.
34246,FATIMA,
34247,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Why will you always treat me like a child? I know I'm not
34248,FATIMA,displacing the horrid things.
34249,FATIMA,
34250,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Resignedly.) Very well, then. Don't blame me if anything"
34251,FATIMA,happens. Play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery.
34252,FATIMA,"(Slipping hand into trousers-pocket.) Oh, the deuce!"
34253,FATIMA,
34254,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Her back to G.) What's that for?
34255,FATIMA,
34256,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Nothing. (Aside.) There's not much in it, but I wish I'd torn"
34257,FATIMA,it up.
34258,FATIMA,
34259,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Turning over contents of table.) I know you'll hate me for
34260,FATIMA,"this; but I do want to see what your work is like. (A pause.) Pip, what"
34261,FATIMA,"are ""farcybuds""?"
34262,FATIMA,
34263,FATIMA,Capt. G. Hah! Would you really like to know? They aren't pretty things.
34264,FATIMA,
34265,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. This Journal of Veterinary Science says they are of ""absorbing"
34266,FATIMA,"interest."" Tell me."
34267,FATIMA,
34268,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) It may turn her attention.
34269,FATIMA,
34270,FATIMA,Gives a long and designedly loathsome account of glanders and farcy.
34271,FATIMA,
34272,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Oh, that's enough. Don't go on!"
34273,FATIMA,
34274,FATIMA,Capt. G. But you wanted to know--Then these things suppurate and
34275,FATIMA,matterate and spread--
34276,FATIMA,
34277,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Pin, you're making me sick! You're a horrid, disgusting"
34278,FATIMA,schoolboy.
34279,FATIMA,
34280,FATIMA,Capt. G. (On his knees among the bridles.) You asked to be told. It's
34281,FATIMA,not my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors.
34282,FATIMA,
34283,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Why didn't you say No?
34284,FATIMA,
34285,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Good Heavens, child! Have you come in here simply to bully me?"
34286,FATIMA,
34287,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I bully you? How could I! You're so strong. (Hysterically.)
34288,FATIMA,Strong enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me
34289,FATIMA,there to cry. Aren't you?
34290,FATIMA,
34291,FATIMA,Capt. G. It seems to me that you're an irrational little baby. Are you
34292,FATIMA,quite well?
34293,FATIMA,
34294,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Do I look ill? (Returning to table). Who is your lady friend
34295,FATIMA,with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?
34296,FATIMA,
34297,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Aside.) Then it wasn't locked up, confound it. (Aloud.)"
34298,FATIMA,"""God made her, therefore let her pass for a woman."" You remember what"
34299,FATIMA,farcybuds are like?
34300,FATIMA,
34301,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Showing envelope.) This has nothing to do with them. I'm going
34302,FATIMA,to open it. May I?
34303,FATIMA,
34304,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Certainly, if you want to. I'd sooner you didn't though. I"
34305,FATIMA,don't ask to look at your letters to the Deercourt girl.
34306,FATIMA,
34307,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. You'd better not, Sir! (Takes letter from envelope.) Now, may I"
34308,FATIMA,"look? If you say no, I shall cry."
34309,FATIMA,
34310,FATIMA,"Capt. G. You've never cried in my knowledge of you, and I don't believe"
34311,FATIMA,you could.
34312,FATIMA,
34313,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. I feel very like it today, Pip. Don't be hard on me. (Reads"
34314,FATIMA,"letter.) It begins in the middle, without any ""Dear Captain Gadsby,"" or"
34315,FATIMA,anything. How funny!
34316,FATIMA,
34317,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Aside.) No, it's not Dear Captain Gadsby, or anything, now."
34318,FATIMA,How funny!
34319,FATIMA,
34320,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. What a strange letter! (Reads.) ""And so the moth has come"
34321,FATIMA,"too near the candle at last, and has been singed into--shall I say"
34322,FATIMA,"Respectability? I congratulate him, and hope he will be as happy as he"
34323,FATIMA,"deserves to be."" What does that mean? Is she congratulating you about"
34324,FATIMA,our marriage?
34325,FATIMA,
34326,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Yes, I suppose so."
34327,FATIMA,
34328,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Still reading letter.) She seems to be a particular friend of
34329,FATIMA,yours.
34330,FATIMA,
34331,FATIMA,Capt. G. Yes. She was an excellent matron of sorts--a Mrs.
34332,FATIMA,Herriott--wife of a Colonel Herriott. I used to know some of her people
34333,FATIMA,at Home long ago--before I came out.
34334,FATIMA,
34335,FATIMA,Mrs. G. Some Colonel's wives are young--as young as me. I knew one who
34336,FATIMA,was younger.
34337,FATIMA,
34338,FATIMA,Capt. G. Then it couldn't have been Mrs. Herriott. She was old enough to
34339,FATIMA,"have been your mother, dear."
34340,FATIMA,
34341,FATIMA,Mrs. G. I remember now. Mrs. Scargill was talking about her at the
34342,FATIMA,"Dutfins' tennis, before you came for me, on Tuesday. Captain Mafflin"
34343,FATIMA,"said she was a ""dear old woman."" Do you know, I think Mafflin is a very"
34344,FATIMA,clumsy man with his feet.
34345,FATIMA,
34346,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Aside.) Good old Jack! (Aloud.) Why, dear?"
34347,FATIMA,
34348,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. He had put his cup down on the ground then, and he literally"
34349,FATIMA,stepped into it. Some of the tea spirted over my dress--the grey one. I
34350,FATIMA,meant to tell you about it before.
34351,FATIMA,
34352,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) There are the makings of a strategist about Jack
34353,FATIMA,"though his methods are coarse. (Aloud.) You'd better get a new dress,"
34354,FATIMA,then. (Aside.) Let us pray that that will turn her.
34355,FATIMA,
34356,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Oh, it isn't stained in the least. I only thought that I'd tell"
34357,FATIMA,you. (Returning to letter.) What an extraordinary person! (Reads.)
34358,FATIMA,"""But need I remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of"
34359,FATIMA,"wardship""--what in the world is a charge of wardship?--""which as you"
34360,FATIMA,"yourself know, may end in Consequences""--"
34361,FATIMA,
34362,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) It's safest to let em see everything as they come
34363,FATIMA,across it; but 'seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule.
34364,FATIMA,(Aloud.) I told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging
34365,FATIMA,my table.
34366,FATIMA,
34367,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Absently.) What does the woman mean? She goes on talking about
34368,FATIMA,"Consequences--""almost inevitable Consequences"" with a capital C--for"
34369,FATIMA,"half a page. (Flushing scarlet.) Oh, good gracious! How abominable!"
34370,FATIMA,
34371,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Promptly.) Do you think so? Doesn't it show a sort of motherly
34372,FATIMA,interest in us? (Aside.) Thank Heaven. Harry always wrapped her meaning
34373,FATIMA,"up safely! (Aloud.) Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter,"
34374,FATIMA,darling?
34375,FATIMA,
34376,FATIMA,Mrs. G. It's impertinent--it's simply horrid. What right has this woman
34377,FATIMA,to write in this way to you? She oughtn't to.
34378,FATIMA,
34379,FATIMA,"Capt. G. When you write to the Deercourt girl, I notice that you"
34380,FATIMA,generally fill three or four sheets. Can't you let an old woman babble
34381,FATIMA,on paper once in a way? She means well.
34382,FATIMA,
34383,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. I don't care. She shouldn't write, and if she did, you ought to"
34384,FATIMA,have shown me her letter.
34385,FATIMA,
34386,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Can't you understand why I kept it to myself, or must I explain"
34387,FATIMA,at length--as I explained the farcybuds?
34388,FATIMA,
34389,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Furiously.) Pip I hate you! This is as bad as those idiotic
34390,FATIMA,"saddle-bags on the floor. Never mind whether it would please me or not,"
34391,FATIMA,you ought to have given it to me to read.
34392,FATIMA,
34393,FATIMA,Capt. G. It comes to the same thing. You took it yourself.
34394,FATIMA,
34395,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. Yes, but if I hadn't taken it, you wouldn't have said a word."
34396,FATIMA,I think this Harriet Herriott--it's like a name in a book--is an
34397,FATIMA,interfering old Thing.
34398,FATIMA,
34399,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Aside.) So long as you thoroughly understand that she is old,"
34400,FATIMA,"I don't much care what you think. (Aloud.) Very good, dear. Would you"
34401,FATIMA,like to write and tell her so? She's seven thousand miles away.
34402,FATIMA,
34403,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. I don't want to have anything to do with her, but you ought to"
34404,FATIMA,"have told me. (Turning to last page of letter.) And she patronizes me,"
34405,FATIMA,"too. I've never seen her! (Reads.) ""I do not know how the world stands"
34406,FATIMA,with you; in all human probability I shall never know; but whatever I
34407,FATIMA,"may have said before, I pray for her sake more than for yours that all"
34408,FATIMA,"may be well. I have learned what misery means, and I dare not wish that"
34409,FATIMA,"any one dear to you should share my knowledge."""
34410,FATIMA,
34411,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Good God! Can't you leave that letter alone, or, at least,"
34412,FATIMA,can't you refrain from reading it aloud? I've been through it once. Put
34413,FATIMA,it back on the desk. Do you hear me?
34414,FATIMA,
34415,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (Irresolutely.) I sh-sha'n't! (Looks at G.'s eyes.) Oh, Pip,"
34416,FATIMA,"please! I didn't mean to make you angry--'Deed, I didn't. Pip, I'm so"
34417,FATIMA,sorry. I know I've wasted your time--
34418,FATIMA,
34419,FATIMA,"Capt. G. (Grimly.) You have. Now, will you be good enough to go--if"
34420,FATIMA,there is nothing more in my room that you are anxious to pry into?
34421,FATIMA,
34422,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (Putting out her hands.) Oh, Pip, don't look at me like that!"
34423,FATIMA,I've never seen you look like that before and it hu-urts me! I'm sorry.
34424,FATIMA,"I oughtn't to have been here at all, and--and--and--(sobbing.) Oh, be"
34425,FATIMA,good to me! Be good to me! There's only you--anywhere! Breaks down in
34426,FATIMA,"long chair, hiding face in cushions."
34427,FATIMA,
34428,FATIMA,Capt. G. (Aside.) She doesn't know how she flicked me on the raw.
34429,FATIMA,"(Aloud, bending over chair.) I didn't mean to be harsh, dear--I didn't"
34430,FATIMA,"really. You can stay here as long as you please, and do what you please."
34431,FATIMA,Don't cry like that. You'll make yourself sick. (Aside.) What on earth
34432,FATIMA,"has come over her? (Aloud.) Darling, what's the matter with you?"
34433,FATIMA,
34434,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Her face still hidden.) Let me go--let me go to my own room.
34435,FATIMA,Only--only say you aren't angry with me.
34436,FATIMA,
34437,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Angry with you, love! Of course not. I was angry with myself."
34438,FATIMA,"I'd lost my temper over the saddlery--Don't hide your face, Pussy. I"
34439,FATIMA,want to kiss it.
34440,FATIMA,
34441,FATIMA,"Bends lower, Mrs. G. slides right arm round his neck. Several interludes"
34442,FATIMA,and much sobbing.
34443,FATIMA,
34444,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (In a whisper.) I didn't mean about the jam when I came in to
34445,FATIMA,tell you-- CAPT. G. Bother the jam and the equipment! (Interlude.)
34446,FATIMA,
34447,FATIMA,Mrs. G. (Still more faintly.) My finger wasn't scalded at all. I--wanted
34448,FATIMA,"to speak to you about--about--something else, and--I didn't know how."
34449,FATIMA,
34450,FATIMA,"Capt. G. Speak away, then. (Looking into her eyes.) Eh! Wha-at? Minnie!"
34451,FATIMA,"Here, don't go away! You don't mean?"
34452,FATIMA,
34453,FATIMA,"Mrs. G. (Hysterically, backing to portiere and hiding her face in its"
34454,FATIMA,folds.) The--the Almost Inevitable Consequences! (Flits through portiere
34455,FATIMA,"as G. attempts to catch her, and bolts her self in her own room.)"
34456,FATIMA,
34457,FATIMA,Capt. G. (His arms full of portiere.) Oh! (Sitting down heavily in

34623,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. Some days; but you'll be all right in a little time.

34626,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",done to my hair?
34627,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34628,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. I d-d-on't know.
34629,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34630,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. They've cut it off. What a shame!
34631,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34632,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. It must have been to make your head cooler.
34633,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34634,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. Just like a boy's wig. Don't I look horrid?
34635,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34636,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. Never looked prettier in your life, dear. (Aside.) How am I to"

34638,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34639,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. I don't feel pretty. I feel very ill. My heart won't work.

34644,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. You're a little feverish, Sweetheart--very feverish. (Breaking"

34647,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. I thought so. Why didn't you tell me that at first?

34653,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. But you aren't! You sha'n't.

34660,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",twenty. Can't they do anything to help me? I don't want to die.
34661,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34662,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. Hush, dear. You won't."
34663,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34664,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. What's the use of talking? Help me! You've never failed me yet.
34665,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Oh, Phil, help me to keep alive. (Feverishly.) I don't believe you wish"

34669,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. (Drawing his hand across his forehead.) It's more than a man's

34673,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","VOICE. No more death. There's enough already. Pip, don't you die too."
34674,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34675,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. I wish I dared.
34676,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34677,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","VOICE. It says: ""Till Death do us part."" Nothing after that--and so it"
34678,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",would be no use. It stops at the dying. Why does it stop there? Only
34679,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","such a very short life, too. Pip, I'm sorry we married."

34684,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","always loved you, though I was cross sometimes. If I ever did anything"
34685,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","that you didn't like, say you forgive me now."

34689,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34690,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. I sulked for a whole week about those petunias. (With a laugh.)
34691,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","What a little wretch I was, and how grieved you were! Forgive me that,"

34693,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34694,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. There's nothing to forgive. It was my fault. They were too near

34696,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",say and so little time to say it in.
34697,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34698,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. Say that you'll always love me--until the end.
34699,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34700,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. Until the end. (Carried away.) It's a lie. It must be, because"

34702,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34703,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. (Relapsing into semi-delirium.) My Church-service has an ivory
34704,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","cross on the back, and it says so, so it must be true. ""Till Death do us"
34705,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","part.""--but that's a lie. (With a parody of G.'s manner.) A damned lie!"
34706,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","(Recklessly.) Yes, I can swear as well as a Trooper, Pip. I can't make"
34707,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","my head think, though. That's because they cut off my hair. How can one"
34708,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","think with one's head all fuzzy? (Pleadingly.) Hold me, Pip! Keep me"

34712,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34713,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. A little before the dawn, dear."
34714,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34715,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?
34716,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34717,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. Would you like to see the Padre?
34718,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34719,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. Why should I? He'd tell me that I am going to heaven; and that
34720,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","wouldn't be true, because you are here. Do you recollect when he upset"
34721,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",the cream-ice all over his trousers at the Gassers' tennis?
34722,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34723,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. Yes, dear."
34724,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34725,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. I often wondered whether he got another pair of trousers; but
34726,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",then his are so shiny all over that you really couldn't tell unless you
34727,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",were told. Let's call him in and ask.
34728,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34729,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","Capt. G. (Gravely.) No. I don't think he'd like that. Your head comfy,"

34731,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34732,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","VOICE. (Faintly with a sigh of contentment.) Yeth! Gracious, Pip, when"
34733,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",did you shave last? Your chin's worse than the barrel of a musical

34738,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34739,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. How funny! I couldn't cry now to save my life. (G. shivers.) I
34740,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",want to sing.

34743,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34744,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",VOICE. Why? I won't be bothered about. (Begins in a hoarse quaver)
34745,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",
34746,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","""Minnie bakes oaten cake, Minnie brews ale,"
34747,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.","All because her Johnnie's coming home from the sea."" (That's parade, Pip.)"

34751,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",(Pettishly.) I knew I couldn't take the last note. How do the bass

34786,"THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.",Capt. G. (Dazed.) I don't quite know. Stay a bit. Have a drink or

34862,(INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.),Mrs. G. That last terrible night.
34863,(INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.),
34864,(INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.),CAPT. G. Then just you forget all about it.
34865,(INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.),
34866,(INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.),"Mrs. G. (Softly, her eyes filling.) Never. It has brought us very close"

34891,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. 'Mornin', Mrs. Gadsby. How's the Infant Phenomenon and the"
34892,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Proud Proprietor?
34893,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34894,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Mrs. G. You'll find them in the front veranda; go through the house. I'm

34900,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"ten months, crawling about the matting."
34901,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34902,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. What's the trouble, Gaddy-spoiling an honest man's Europe"
34903,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"morning this way? (Seeing G. JUNIOR.) By Jove, that yearling's comin' on"
34904,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,amazingly! Any amount of bone below the knee there.
34905,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34906,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Yes, he's a healthy little scoundrel. Don't you think his"
34907,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,hair's growing?
34908,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34909,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Let's have a look. Hi! Hst Come here, General Luck, and we'll"
34910,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,report on you.
34911,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34912,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Mrs. G. (Within.) What absurd name will you give him next? Why do you
34913,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,call him that?
34914,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34915,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Isn't he our Inspector-General of Cavalry? Doesn't he come down
34916,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,in his seventeen-two perambulator every morning the Pink Hussars parade?
34917,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Don't wriggle, Brigadier. Give us your private opinion on the way the"
34918,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"third squadron went past. 'Trifle ragged, weren't they?"
34919,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34920,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. A bigger set of tailors than the new draft I don't wish to see.
34921,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,They've given me more than my fair share--knocking the squadron out of
34922,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,shape. It's sickening!
34923,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34924,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. When you're in command, you'll do better, young 'un. Can'tyou"
34925,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"walk yet? Grip my finger and try. (To G.) 'Twon't hurt his hocks, will"
34926,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,it?
34927,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34928,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Oh, no. Don't let him flop, though, or he'll lick all the"
34929,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,blacking off your boots.
34930,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34931,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Mrs. G. (Within.) Who's destroying my son's character?
34932,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34933,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. And my Godson's. I'm ashamed of you, Gaddy. Punch your father"
34934,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"in the eye, Jack! Don't you stand it! Hit him again!"
34935,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34936,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. (Sotto voce.) Put The Butcha down and come to the end of the
34937,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,veranda. I'd rather the Wife didn't hear--just now.
34938,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34939,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. You look awf'ly serious. Anything wrong?
34940,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34941,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. 'Depends on your view entirely. I say, Jack, you won't think"
34942,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"more hardly of me than you can help, will you? Come further this"
34943,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"way.--The fact of the matter is, that I've made up my mind--at least I'm"
34944,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,thinking seriously of--cutting the Service.
34945,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34946,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Hwhatt?
34947,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34948,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Don't shout. I'm going to send in my papers.
34949,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34950,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. You! Are you mad?
34951,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34952,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. No--only married.
34953,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34954,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Look here! What's the meaning of it all? You never intend to
34955,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,leave us. You can't. Isn't the best squadron of the best regiment of the
34956,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,best cavalry in all the world good enough for you?
34957,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34958,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. (Jerking his head over his shoulder.) She doesn't seem to
34959,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"thrive in this God-forsaken country, and there's The Butcha to be"
34960,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"considered and all that, you know."
34961,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34962,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Does she say that she doesn't like India?
34963,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34964,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. That's the worst of it. She won't for fear of leaving me.
34965,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34966,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. What are the Hills made for?
34967,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34968,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Not for my wife, at any rate."
34969,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34970,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. You know too much, Gaddy, and--I don't like you any the better"
34971,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,for it!
34972,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34973,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Never mind that. She wants England, and The Butcha would be all"
34974,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,the better for it. I'm going to chuck. You don't understand.
34975,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34976,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Hotly.) I understand this!--One hundred and thirty-seven new
34977,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,horse to be licked into shape somehow before Luck comes round again; a
34978,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,hairy-heeled draft who'll give more trouble than the horses; a camp next
34979,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,cold weather for a certainty; ourselves the first on the roster; the
34980,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minutes' notice, and you,"
34981,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"the best of us all, backing out of it all! Think a little, Gaddy. You"
34982,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,won't do it.
34983,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34984,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Hang it, a man has some duties toward his family, I suppose."
34985,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34986,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. I remember a man, though, who told me, the night after"
34987,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Amdheran, when we were picketed under Jagai, and he'd left his sword--by"
34988,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"the way, did you ever pay Ranken for that sword?--in an Utmanzai's"
34989,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,head--that man told me that he'd stick by me and the Pinks as long as
34990,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,he lived. I don't blame him for not sticking by me--I'm not much of a
34991,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,man--but I do blame him for not sticking by the Pink Hussars.
34992,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34993,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. (Uneasily.) We were little more than boys then. Can't you see,"
34994,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Jack, how things stand? 'Tisn't as if we were serving for our bread."
34995,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"We've all of us, more or less, got the filthy lucre. I'm luckier than"
34996,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"some, perhaps. There's no call for me to serve on."
34997,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
34998,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. None in the world for you or for us, except the Regimental. If"
34999,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"you don't choose to answer to that, of course--"
35000,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35001,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Don't be too hard on a man. You know that a lot of us only take
35002,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,up the thing for a few years and then go back to Town and catch on with
35003,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,the rest.
35004,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35005,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Not lots, and they aren't some of Us."
35006,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35007,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. And then there are one's affairs at Home to be considered--my
35008,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"place and the rents, and all that. I don't suppose my father can last"
35009,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"much longer, and that means the title, and so on."
35010,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35011,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. 'Fraid you won't be entered in the Stud Book correctly unless
35012,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"you go Home? Take six months, then, and come out in October. If I could"
35013,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"slay off a brother or two, I s'pose I should be a Marquis of sorts."
35014,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Any fool can be that; but it needs men, Gaddy--men like you--to lead"
35015,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,flanking squadrons properly. Don't you delude yourself into the belief
35016,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,that you're going Home to take your place and prance about among
35017,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,pink-nosed Kabuli dowagers. You aren't built that way. I know better.
35018,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35019,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. A man has a right to live his life as happily as he can. You
35020,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,aren't married.
35021,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35022,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. No--praise be to Providence and the one or two women who have
35023,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,had the good sense to jawab me.
35024,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35025,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Then you don't know what it is to go into your own room and see
35026,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"your wife's head on the pillow, and when everything else is safe and the"
35027,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"house shut up for the night, to wonder whether the roof-beams won't give"
35028,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,and kill her.
35029,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35030,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Aside.) Revelations first and second! (Aloud.) So-o! I knew
35031,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,a man who got squiffy at our Mess once and confided to me that he never
35032,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,helped his wife on to her horse without praying that she'd break her
35033,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"neck before she came back. All husbands aren't alike, you see."
35034,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35035,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. What on earth has that to do with my case? The man must ha'
35036,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"been mad, or his wife as bad as they make 'em."
35037,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35038,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Aside.) 'No fault of yours if either weren't all you say.
35039,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,You've forgotten the time when you were insane about the Herriott woman.
35040,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,You always were a good hand at forgetting. (Aloud.) Not more mad than
35041,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"men who go to the other extreme. Be reasonable, Gaddy. Your roof-beams"
35042,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,are sound enough.
35043,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35044,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. That was only a way of speaking. I've been uneasy and worried
35045,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,about the Wife ever since that awful business three years ago--when--I
35046,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,nearly lost her. Can you wonder?
35047,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35048,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Oh, a shell never falls twice in the same place. You've paid"
35049,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,your toll to misfortune--why should your Wife be picked out more than
35050,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,anybody else's?
35051,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35052,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. I can talk just as reasonably as you can, but you don't"
35053,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,understand--you don't understand. And then there's The Butcha. Deuce
35054,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,knows where the Ayah takes him to sit in the evening! He has a bit of a
35055,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,cough. Haven't you noticed it?
35056,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35057,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Bosh! The Brigadier's jumping out of his skin with pure
35058,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,condition. He's got a muzzle like a rose-leaf and the chest of a
35059,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,two-year-old. What's demoralized you?
35060,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35061,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Funk. That's the long and the short of it. Funk!
35062,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35063,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. But what is there to funk?
35064,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35065,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Everything. It's ghastly.
35066,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35067,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Ah! I see. You don't want to fight, And by Jingo when we do,"
35068,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"You've got the kid, you've got the Wife,"
35069,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"You've got the money, too."
35070,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"That's about the case, eh?"
35071,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35072,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. I suppose that's it. But it's not for myself. It's because of
35073,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,them. At least I think it is.
35074,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35075,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Are you sure? Looking at the matter in a cold-blooded light,"
35076,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,the Wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight. She has
35077,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"an ancestral home to go to, money and the Brigadier to carry on the"
35078,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,illustrious name.
35079,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35080,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Then it is for myself or because they are part of me. You don't
35081,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"see it. My life's so good, so pleasant, as it is, that I want to make it"
35082,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,quite safe. Can't you understand?
35083,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35084,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Perfectly. ""Shelter-pit for the Off'cer's charger,"" as they say"
35085,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,in the Line.
35086,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35087,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. And I have everything to my hand to make it so. I'm sick of the
35088,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,strain and the worry for their sakes out here; and there isn't a single
35089,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,real difficulty to prevent my dropping it altogether. It'll only cost
35090,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"me--Jack, I hope you'll never know the shame that I've been going"
35091,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,through for the past six months.
35092,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35093,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Hold on there! I don't wish to be told. Every man has his moods
35094,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,and tenses sometimes.
35095,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35096,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. (Laughing bitterly.) Has he? What do you call craning over to
35097,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,see where your near-fore lands?
35098,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35099,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. In my case it means that I have been on the Considerable Bend,"
35100,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,and have come to parade with a Head and a Hand. It passes in three
35101,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,strides.
35102,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35103,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. (Lowering voice.) It never passes with me, Jack. I'm always"
35104,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"thinking about it. Phil Gadsby funking a fall on parade! Sweet picture,"
35105,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,isn't it! Draw it for me.
35106,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35107,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Gravely.) Heaven forbid! A man like you can't be as bad as
35108,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"that. A fall is no nice thing, but one never gives it a thought."
35109,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35110,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Doesn't one? Wait till you've got a wife and a youngster of
35111,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"your own, and then you'll know how the roar of the squadron behind you"
35112,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,turns you cold all up the back.
35113,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35114,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Aside.) And this man led at Amdheran after Bagal Deasin went
35115,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"under, and we were all mixed up together, and he came out of the snow"
35116,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"dripping like a butcher. (Aloud.) Skittles! The men can always open out,"
35117,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,and you can always pick your way more or less. We haven't the dust to
35118,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a"
35119,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,man?
35120,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35121,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Never--as long as he can see. But did they open out for poor
35122,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Errington?
35123,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35124,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Oh, this is childish!"
35125,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35126,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. I know it is, worse than that. I don't care. You've ridden"
35127,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Van Loo. Is he the sort of brute to pick his way--'specially when we're
35128,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,coming up in column of troop with any pace on?
35129,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35130,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Once in a Blue Moon do we gallop in column of troop, and then"
35131,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,only to save time. Aren't three lengths enough for you?
35132,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35133,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Yes--quite enough. They just allow for the full development of
35134,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"the smash. I'm talking like a cur, I know: but I tell you that, for the"
35135,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"past three months, I've felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of"
35136,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,my back every time that I've led.
35137,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35138,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. But, Gaddy, this is awful!"
35139,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35140,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Isn't it lovely? Isn't it royal? A Captain of the Pink Hussars
35141,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing Colonel
35142,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,of a Black Regiment!
35143,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35144,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. You never did!
35145,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35146,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Once only. He squelched like a mussuck, and the"
35147,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Troop-Sergeant-Major cocked his eye at me. You know old Haffy's eye. I
35148,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,was afraid to do it again.
35149,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35150,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. I should think so. That was the best way to rupture old Van
35151,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Loo's tummy, and make him crumple you up. You knew that."
35152,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35153,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. I didn't care. It took the edge off him.
35154,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35155,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. ""Took the edge off him""? Gaddy, you--you--you mustn't, you"
35156,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,know! Think of the men.
35157,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35158,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. That's another thing I am afraid of. D'you s'pose they know?
35159,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35160,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Let's hope not; but they're deadly quick to spot skirm--little
35161,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"things of that kind. See here, old man, send the Wife Home for the hot"
35162,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,weather and come to Kashmir with me. We'll start a boat on the Dal or
35163,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,cross the Rhotang--shoot ibex or loaf--which you please. Only come!
35164,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,You're a bit off your oats and you're talking nonsense. Look at the
35165,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Colonel--swag-bellied rascal that he is. He has a wife and no end of a
35166,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,bow-window of his own. Can any one of us ride round him--chalkstones and
35167,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"all? I can't, and I think I can shove a crock along a bit."
35168,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35169,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Some men are different. I haven't any nerve. Lord help me, I"
35170,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,haven't the nerve! I've taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well
35171,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,under the wallets. I can't help it. I'm so afraid of anything happening
35172,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"to me. On my soul, I ought to be broke in front of the squadron, for"
35173,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,cowardice.
35174,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35175,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. Ugly word, that. I should never have the courage to own up."
35176,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35177,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. I meant to lie about my reasons when I began, but--I've got out"
35178,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"of the habit of lying to you, old man. Jack, you won't?--But I know you"
35179,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,won't.
35180,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35181,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Of course not. (Half aloud.) The Pinks are paying dearly for
35182,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,their Pride.
35183,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35184,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Eh! Wha-at?
35185,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35186,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Don't you know? The men have called Mrs. Gadsby the Pride of
35187,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,the Pink Hussars ever since she came to us.
35188,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35189,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. 'Tisn't her fault. Don't think that. It's all mine.
35190,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35191,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. What does she say?
35192,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35193,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. I haven't exactly put it before her. She's the best little
35194,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"woman in the world, Jack, and all that--but she wouldn't counsel a man"
35195,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"to stick to his calling if it came between him and her. At least, I"
35196,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,think--
35197,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35198,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Never mind. Don't tell her what you told me. Go on the Peerage
35199,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,and Landed-Gentry tack.
35200,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35201,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. She'd see through it. She's five times cleverer than I am.
35202,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35203,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Aside.) Then she'll accept the sacrifice and think a little
35204,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,bit worse of him for the rest of her days.
35205,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35206,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. (Absently.) I say, do you despise me?"
35207,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35208,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. 'Queer way of putting it. Have you ever been asked that
35209,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,question? Think a minute. What answer used you to give?
35210,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35211,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. So bad as that? I'm not entitled to expect anything more, but"
35212,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,it's a bit hard when one's best friend turns round and--
35213,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35214,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. So I have found. But you will have consolations--Bailiffs
35215,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"and Drains and Liquid Manure and the Primrose League, and, perhaps,"
35216,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"if you're lucky, the Colonelcy of a Yeomanry Cav-al-ry Regiment--all"
35217,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"uniform and no riding, I believe. How old are you?"
35218,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35219,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Thirty-three. I know it's--
35220,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35221,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. At forty you'll be a fool of a J. P. landlord. At fifty you'll
35222,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"own a bath-chair, and The Brigadier, if he takes after you, will be"
35223,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,fluttering the dovecotes of--what's the particular dunghill you're going
35224,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"to? Also, Mrs. Gadsby will be fat."
35225,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35226,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. (Limply.) This is rather more than a joke.
35227,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35228,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. D'you think so? Isn't cutting the Service a joke? It generally
35229,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"takes a man fifty years to arrive at it. You're quite right, though. It"
35230,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,is more than a joke. You've managed it in thirty-three.
35231,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35232,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. Don't make me feel worse than I do. Will it satisfy you if I
35233,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"own that I am a shirker, a skrim-shanker, and a coward?"
35234,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35235,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. It will not, because I'm the only man in the world who can talk"
35236,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,to you like this without being knocked down. You mustn't take all that
35237,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,I've said to heart in this way. I only spoke--a lot of it at least--out
35238,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"of pure selfishness, because, because--Oh, damn it all, old man,--I"
35239,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"don't know what I shall do without you. Of course, you've got the money"
35240,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,and the place and all that--and there are two very good reasons why you
35241,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,should take care of yourself.
35242,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35243,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. G. 'Doesn't make it any sweeter. I'm backing out--I know I am. I
35244,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,always had a soft drop in me somewhere--and I daren't risk any danger to
35245,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,them.
35246,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35247,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. Why in the world should you? You're bound to think of your
35248,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,family--bound to think. Er--hmm. If I wasn't a younger son I'd go
35249,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,too--be shot if I wouldn't!
35250,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35251,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Thank you, Jack. It's a kind lie, but it's the blackest you've"
35252,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"told for some time. I know what I'm doing, and I'm going into it with my"
35253,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"eyes open. Old man, I can't help it. What would you do if you were in my"
35254,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,place?
35255,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35256,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. (Aside.) 'Couldn't conceive any woman getting permanently
35257,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,between me and the Regiment. (Aloud.) 'Can't say. 'Very likely I should
35258,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"do no better. I'm sorry for you--awf'ly sorry--but ""if them's your"
35259,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"sentiments,"" I believe, I really do, that you are acting wisely."
35260,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35261,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. Do you? I hope you do. (In a whisper.) Jack, be very sure of"
35262,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"yourself before you marry. I'm an ungrateful ruffian to say this, but"
35263,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,marriage--even as good a marriage as mine has been--hampers a man's
35264,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"work, it cripples his sword-arm, and oh, it plays Hell with his notions"
35265,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,of duty. Sometimes--good and sweet as she is--sometimes I could wish
35266,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"that I had kept my freedom--No, I don't mean that exactly."
35267,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35268,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Mrs. G. (Coming down veranda.) What are you wagging your head over, Pip?"
35269,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35270,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. (Turning quickly.) Me, as usual. The old sermon. Your husband"
35271,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,is recommending me to get married. 'Never saw such a one-ideaed man.
35272,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35273,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Mrs. G. Well, why don't you? I dare say you would make some woman very"
35274,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,happy.
35275,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35276,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. G. There's the Law and the Prophets, Jack. Never mind the"
35277,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Regiment. Make a woman happy. (Aside.) O Lord!
35278,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35279,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,Capt. M. We'll see. I must be off to make a Troop Cook desperately
35280,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,unhappy. I won't have the wily Hussar fed on Government Bullock Train
35281,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,shinbones--(Hastily.) Surely black ants can't be good for The Brigadier.
35282,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"He's picking em off the matting and eating 'em. Here, Senor Comandante"
35283,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Don Grubbynose, come and talk to me. (Lifts G. JUNIOR in his arms.)"
35284,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"'Want my watch? You won't be able to put it into your mouth, but you can"
35285,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"try. (G. JUNIOR drops watch, breaking dial and hands.)"
35286,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35287,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Mrs. G. Oh, Captain Mafflin, I am so sorry! Jack, you bad, bad little"
35288,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,villain. Ahhh!
35289,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35290,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Capt. M. It's not the least consequence, I assure you. He'd treat the"
35291,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,world in the same way if he could get it into his hands. Everything's
35292,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"made to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?"

35295,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,
35296,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"Mrs. G. Mafflin didn't at all like his watch being broken, though he"
35297,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,was too polite to say so. It was entirely his fault for giving it to
35298,THE SWELLING OF JORDAN,"the child. Dem little puds are werry, werry feeble, aren't dey, by"

35328,BIMI,THE orangoutang in the big iron cage lashed to the sheep-pen began the
35329,BIMI,"discussion. The night was stiflingly hot, and as Hans Breitmann and I"
35330,BIMI,"passed him, dragging our bedding to the fore-peak of the steamer, he"
35331,BIMI,roused himself and chattered obscenely. He had been caught somewhere in
35332,BIMI,"the Malayan Archipelago, and was going to England to be exhibited at a"
35333,BIMI,"shilling a head. For four days he had struggled, yelled, and wrenched at"
35334,BIMI,"the heavy iron bars of his prison without ceasing, and had nearly slain"
35335,BIMI,a Lascar incautious enough to come within reach of the great hairy paw.
35336,BIMI,
35337,BIMI,"""It would be well for you, mine friend, if you was a liddle seasick,"""
35338,BIMI,"said Hans Breitmann, pausing by the cage. ""You haf too much Ego in your"
35339,BIMI,"Cosmos."""
35340,BIMI,
35341,BIMI,The orangoutang's arm slid out negligently from between the bars. No one
35342,BIMI,would have believed that it would make a sudden snake-like rush at
35343,BIMI,the German's breast. The thin silk of the sleeping-suit tore out: Hans
35344,BIMI,"stepped back unconcernedly, to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close"
35345,BIMI,to one of the boats.
35346,BIMI,
35347,BIMI,"""Too much Ego,"" said he, peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged"
35348,BIMI,"devil, who was rending the silk to tatters."
35349,BIMI,
35350,BIMI,"Then we laid out our bedding in the bows, among the sleeping Lascars,"
35351,BIMI,to catch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us. The sea was
35352,BIMI,"like smoky oil, except where it turned to fire under our forefoot"
35353,BIMI,and whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame. There was a
35354,BIMI,thunderstorm some miles away: we could see the glimmer of the lightning.
35355,BIMI,"The ship's cow, distressed by the heat and the smell of the ape-beast in"
35356,BIMI,"the cage, lowed unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as"
35357,BIMI,the lookout man at the bows answered the hourly call from the bridge.
35358,BIMI,"The trampling tune of the engines was very distinct, and the jarring"
35359,BIMI,"of the ash-lift, as it was tipped into the sea, hurt the procession of"
35360,BIMI,hushed noise. Hans lay down by my side and lighted a good-night cigar.
35361,BIMI,This was naturally the beginning of conversation. He owned a voice as
35362,BIMI,"soothing as the wash of the sea, and stores of experiences as vast as"
35363,BIMI,the sea itself; for his business in life was to wander up and down the
35364,BIMI,"world, collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for"
35365,BIMI,German and American dealers. I watched the glowing end of his cigar wax
35366,BIMI,"and wane in the gloom, as the sentences rose and fell, till I was nearly"
35367,BIMI,"asleep. The orangoutang, troubled by some dream of the forests of his"
35368,BIMI,"freedom, began to yell like a soul in purgatory, and to wrench madly at"
35369,BIMI,the bars of the cage.
35370,BIMI,
35371,BIMI,"""If he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabouts,"" said"
35372,BIMI,"Hans, lazily. ""He screams good. See, now, how I shall tame him when he"
35373,BIMI,"stops himself."""
35374,BIMI,
35375,BIMI,"There was a pause in the outcry, and from Hans' mouth came an imitation"
35376,BIMI,"of a snake's hiss, so perfect that I almost sprung to my feet. The"
35377,BIMI,"sustained murderous sound ran along the deck, and the wrenching at the"
35378,BIMI,bars ceased. The orangoutang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror.
35379,BIMI,
35380,BIMI,"""Dot stop him,"" said Hans. ""I learned dot trick in Mogoung Tanjong when"
35381,BIMI,I was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in Berlin. Efery one
35382,BIMI,in der world is afraid of der monkeys except der snake. So I blay snake
35383,BIMI,"against monkey, and he keep quite still. Dere was too much Ego in his"
35384,BIMI,"Cosmos. Dot is der soul-custom of monkeys. Are you asleep, or will you"
35385,BIMI,"listen, and I will tell a dale dot you shall not pelief?"""
35386,BIMI,
35387,BIMI,"""There's no tale in the wide world that I can't believe,"" I said."
35388,BIMI,
35389,BIMI,"""If you have learned pelief you haf learned somedings. Now I shall try"
35390,BIMI,your pelief. Good! When I was collecting dose liddle monkeys--it was in
35391,BIMI,"'79 or '80, und I was in der islands of der Archipelago--over dere in"
35392,BIMI,"der dark""--he pointed southward to New Guinea generally--""Mein Gott! I"
35393,BIMI,would sooner collect life red devils than liddle monkeys. When
35394,BIMI,dey do not bite off your thumbs dey are always dying from
35395,BIMI,"nostalgia--homesick--for dey haf der imperfect soul, which is midway"
35396,BIMI,"arrested in defelopment--und too much Ego. I was dere for nearly a year,"
35397,BIMI,"und dere I found a man dot was called Bertran. He was a Frenchman, und"
35398,BIMI,he was a goot man--naturalist to the bone. Dey said he was an escaped
35399,BIMI,"convict, but he was a naturalist, und dot was enough for me. He would"
35400,BIMI,"call all her life beasts from der forests, und dey would come. I said"
35401,BIMI,"he was St. Francis of Assisi in a new dransmigration produced, und he"
35402,BIMI,laughed und said he had never preach to der fishes. He sold dem for
35403,BIMI,trepang--beche-de-mer.
35404,BIMI,
35405,BIMI,"""Und dot man, who was king of beasts-tamer men, he had in der house"
35406,BIMI,shush such anoder as dot devil-animal in der cage--a great orangoutang
35407,BIMI,dot thought he was a man. He haf found him when he was a child--der
35408,BIMI,orangoutang--und he was child and brother and opera comique all round to
35409,BIMI,"Bertran. He had his room in dot house--not a cage, but a room--mit a bed"
35410,BIMI,"and sheets, and he would go to bed and get up in der morning and smoke"
35411,BIMI,"his cigar und eat his dinner mit Bertran, und walk mit him hand-in-hand,"
35412,BIMI,which was most horrible. Herr Gott! I haf seen dot beast throw himself
35413,BIMI,back in his chair and laugh when Bertran haf made fun of me. He was
35414,BIMI,"not a beast; he was a man, and he talked to Bertran, und Bertran"
35415,BIMI,"comprehended, for I have seen dem. Und he was always politeful to me"
35416,BIMI,except when I talk too long to Bertran und say nodings at all to him.
35417,BIMI,"Den he would pull me away--dis great, dark devil, mit his enormous paws"
35418,BIMI,"shush as if I was a child. He was not a beast, he was a man. Dis I saw"
35419,BIMI,"pefore I know him three months, und Bertran he haf saw the same; and"
35420,BIMI,"Bimi, der orangoutang, haf understood us both, mit his cigar between his"
35421,BIMI,big-dog teeth und der blue gum.
35422,BIMI,
35423,BIMI,"""I was dere a year, dere und at dere oder islands--somedimes for monkeys"
35424,BIMI,and somedimes for butterflies und orchits. One time Bertran says to me
35425,BIMI,"dot he will be married, because he hass found a girl dot was goot, and"
35426,BIMI,"he inquire if this marrying idea was right. I would not say, pecause"
35427,BIMI,it was not me dot was going to be married. Den he go off courting der
35428,BIMI,girl--she was a half-caste French girl--very pretty. Haf you got a new
35429,BIMI,light for my cigar? Oof! Very pretty. Only I say 'Haf you thought of
35430,BIMI,"Bimi? If he pulls me away when I talk to you, what will he do to your"
35431,BIMI,"wife? He will pull her in pieces. If I was you, Bertran, I would gif my"
35432,BIMI,wife for wedding present der stuff figure of Bimi.' By dot time I bad
35433,BIMI,learned somedings about der monkey peoples. 'Shoot him?' says Bertran.
35434,BIMI,"'He is your beast,' I said; 'if he was mine he would be shot now.'"
35435,BIMI,
35436,BIMI,"""Den I felt at der back of my neck der fingers of Bimi. Mein Gott! I"
35437,BIMI,tell you dot he talked through dose fingers. It was der deaf-and-dumb
35438,BIMI,"alphabet all gomplete. He slide his hairy arm round my neck, and he tilt"
35439,BIMI,"up my chin and look into my face, shust to see if I understood his talk"
35440,BIMI,so well as he understood mine.
35441,BIMI,
35442,BIMI,"""'See now dere!' says Bertran, 'und you would shoot him while he is"
35443,BIMI,cuddling you? Dot is der Teuton ingrate!'
35444,BIMI,
35445,BIMI,"""But I knew dot I had made Bimi a life's enemy, pecause his fingers haf"
35446,BIMI,talk murder through the back of my neck. Next dime I see Bimi dere was
35447,BIMI,"a pistol in my belt, und he touch it once, and I open de breech to show"

35537,NAMGAY DOOLA,"ONCE upon a time there was a king who lived on the road to Thibet, very"
35538,NAMGAY DOOLA,"many miles in the Himalaya Mountains. His kingdom was 11,000 feet above"
35539,NAMGAY DOOLA,"the sea, and exactly four miles square, but most of the miles stood on"
35540,NAMGAY DOOLA,"end, owing to the nature of the country. His revenues were rather less"
35541,NAMGAY DOOLA,"than 400 pounds yearly, and they were expended on the maintenance of one"
35542,NAMGAY DOOLA,elephant and a standing army of five men. He was tributary to the Indian
35543,NAMGAY DOOLA,"government, who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of the"
35544,NAMGAY DOOLA,Himalaya-Thibet road in repair. He further increased his revenues by
35545,NAMGAY DOOLA,"selling timber to the railway companies, for he would cut the great"
35546,NAMGAY DOOLA,deodar trees in his own forest and they fell thundering into the Sutlej
35547,NAMGAY DOOLA,"River and were swept down to the Plains, 300 miles away, and became"
35548,NAMGAY DOOLA,"railway ties. Now and again this king, whose name does not matter, would"
35549,NAMGAY DOOLA,mount a ring-streaked horse and ride scores of miles to Simlatown to
35550,NAMGAY DOOLA,"confer with the lieutenant-governor on matters of state, or assure the"
35551,NAMGAY DOOLA,viceroy that his sword was at the service of the queen-empress. Then
35552,NAMGAY DOOLA,the viceroy would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded and the
35553,NAMGAY DOOLA,ring-streaked horse and the cavalry of the state--two men in
35554,NAMGAY DOOLA,tatters--and the herald who bore the Silver Stick before the king
35555,NAMGAY DOOLA,"would trot back to their own place, which was between the tail of a"
35556,NAMGAY DOOLA,heaven-climbing glacier and a dark birch forest.
35557,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35558,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Now, from such a king, always remembering that he possessed one"
35559,NAMGAY DOOLA,"veritable elephant and could count his descent for 1,200 years, I"
35560,NAMGAY DOOLA,"expected, when it was my fate to wander through his dominions, no more"
35561,NAMGAY DOOLA,than mere license to live.
35562,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35563,NAMGAY DOOLA,"The night had closed in rain, and rolling clouds blotted out the lights"
35564,NAMGAY DOOLA,"of the villages in the valley. Forty miles away, untouched by cloud or"
35565,NAMGAY DOOLA,"storm, the white shoulder of Dongo Pa--the Mountain of the Council of"
35566,NAMGAY DOOLA,the Gods--upheld the evening star. The monkeys sung sorrowfully to each
35567,NAMGAY DOOLA,"other as they hunted for dry roots in the fern-draped trees, and the"
35568,NAMGAY DOOLA,last puff of the day-wind brought from the unseen villages the scent
35569,NAMGAY DOOLA,"of damp wood smoke, hot cakes, dripping undergrowth, and rotting"
35570,NAMGAY DOOLA,"pine-cones. That smell is the true smell of the Himalayas, and if it"
35571,NAMGAY DOOLA,"once gets into the blood of a man he will, at the last, forgetting"
35572,NAMGAY DOOLA,"everything else, return to the Hills to die. The clouds closed and the"
35573,NAMGAY DOOLA,"smell went away, and there remained nothing in all the world except"
35574,NAMGAY DOOLA,chilling white mists and the boom of the Sutlej River.
35575,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35576,NAMGAY DOOLA,"A fat-tailed sheep, who did not want to die, bleated lamentably at"
35577,NAMGAY DOOLA,my tent-door. He was scuffling with the prime minister and the
35578,NAMGAY DOOLA,"director-general of public education, and he was a royal gift to me and"
35579,NAMGAY DOOLA,my camp servants. I expressed my thanks suitably and inquired if I might
35580,NAMGAY DOOLA,have audience of the king. The prime minister readjusted his turban--it
35581,NAMGAY DOOLA,had fallen off in the struggle--and assured me that the king would
35582,NAMGAY DOOLA,be very pleased to see me. Therefore I dispatched two bottles as a
35583,NAMGAY DOOLA,"foretaste, and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation,"
35584,NAMGAY DOOLA,climbed up to the king's palace through the wet. He had sent his army
35585,NAMGAY DOOLA,"to escort me, but it stayed to talk with my cook. Soldiers are very much"
35586,NAMGAY DOOLA,alike all the world over.
35587,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35588,NAMGAY DOOLA,"The palace was a four-roomed, white-washed mud-and-timber house, the"
35589,NAMGAY DOOLA,finest in all the Hills for a day's journey. The king was dressed in a
35590,NAMGAY DOOLA,"purple velvet jacket, white muslin trousers, and a saffron-yellow turban"
35591,NAMGAY DOOLA,of price. He gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the
35592,NAMGAY DOOLA,"palace courtyard, which was occupied by the elephant of state. The great"
35593,NAMGAY DOOLA,"beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail, and the curve of his"
35594,NAMGAY DOOLA,back stood out against the sky line.
35595,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35596,NAMGAY DOOLA,The prime minister and the director-general of public instruction were
35597,NAMGAY DOOLA,present to introduce me; but all the court had been dismissed lest
35598,NAMGAY DOOLA,the two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals. The king cast a
35599,NAMGAY DOOLA,"wreath of heavy, scented flowers round my neck as I bowed, and inquired"
35600,NAMGAY DOOLA,how my honored presence had the felicity to be. I said that through
35601,NAMGAY DOOLA,seeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned
35602,NAMGAY DOOLA,"into sunshine, and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good"
35603,NAMGAY DOOLA,deeds would be remembered by the gods. He said that since I had set my
35604,NAMGAY DOOLA,magnificent foot in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy
35605,NAMGAY DOOLA,per cent more than the average. I said that the fame of the king had
35606,NAMGAY DOOLA,"reached to the four corners of the earth, and that the nations gnashed"
35607,NAMGAY DOOLA,their teeth when they heard daily of the glory of his realm and the
35608,NAMGAY DOOLA,wisdom of his moon-like prime minister and lotus-eyed director-general
35609,NAMGAY DOOLA,of public education.
35610,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35611,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Then we sat down on clean white cushions, and I was at the king's right"
35612,NAMGAY DOOLA,hand. Three minutes later he was telling me that the condition of the
35613,NAMGAY DOOLA,"maize crop was something disgraceful, and that the railway companies"
35614,NAMGAY DOOLA,would not pay him enough for his timber. The talk shifted to and fro
35615,NAMGAY DOOLA,"with the bottles. We discussed very many quaint things, and the king"
35616,NAMGAY DOOLA,became confidential on the subject of government generally. Most of all
35617,NAMGAY DOOLA,"he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his subjects, who, from what I"
35618,NAMGAY DOOLA,"could gather, had been paralyzing the executive."
35619,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35620,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""In the old days,"" said the king, ""I could have ordered the elephant"
35621,NAMGAY DOOLA,yonder to trample him to death. Now I must e'en send him seventy miles
35622,NAMGAY DOOLA,"across the hills to be tried, and his keep for that time would be upon"
35623,NAMGAY DOOLA,"the state. And the elephant eats everything."""
35624,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35625,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""What be the man's crimes, Rajah Sahib?"" said I."
35626,NAMGAY DOOLA,

35628,NAMGAY DOOLA,"since of my favor I gave him land upon his coming, he refuses to pay"
35629,NAMGAY DOOLA,"revenue. Am I not the lord of the earth, above and below--entitled by"
35630,NAMGAY DOOLA,"right and custom to one-eighth of the crop? Yet this devil, establishing"
35631,NAMGAY DOOLA,"himself, refuses to pay a single tax... and he brings a poisonous"
35632,NAMGAY DOOLA,"spawn of babes."""
35633,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35634,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Cast him into jail,"" I said."
35635,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35636,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Sahib,"" the king answered, shifting a little on the cushions, ""once and"
35637,NAMGAY DOOLA,only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I was not
35638,NAMGAY DOOLA,able to go abroad. In that hour I made a vow to my God that I would
35639,NAMGAY DOOLA,never again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of
35640,NAMGAY DOOLA,"God, for I perceived the nature of the punishment. How can I break my"
35641,NAMGAY DOOLA,"vow? Were it only the lopping off of a hand or a foot, I should not"
35642,NAMGAY DOOLA,delay. But even that is impossible now that the English have rule. One
35643,NAMGAY DOOLA,"or another of my people""--he looked obliquely at the director-general"
35644,NAMGAY DOOLA,"of public education--""would at once write a letter to the viceroy, and"
35645,NAMGAY DOOLA,"perhaps I should be deprived of that ruffle of drums."""
35646,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35647,NAMGAY DOOLA,"He unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver water-pipe, fitted a plain"
35648,NAMGAY DOOLA,"amber one, and passed the pipe to me. ""Not content with refusing"
35649,NAMGAY DOOLA,"revenue,"" he continued, ""this outlander refuses also to beegar"" (this is"
35650,NAMGAY DOOLA,"the corvee or forced labor on the roads), ""and stirs my people up to the"
35651,NAMGAY DOOLA,"like treason. Yet he is, if so he wills, an expert log-snatcher. There"
35652,NAMGAY DOOLA,is none better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river
35653,NAMGAY DOOLA,"when the logs stick fast."""
35654,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35655,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""But he worships strange gods,"" said the prime minister, deferentially."
35656,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35657,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""For that I have no concern,"" said the king, who was as tolerant as"
35658,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Akbar in matters of belief. ""To each man his own god, and the fire or"
35659,NAMGAY DOOLA,Mother Earth for us all at the last. It is the rebellion that offends
35660,NAMGAY DOOLA,"me."""
35661,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35662,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""The king has an army,"" I suggested. ""Has not the king burned the man's"
35663,NAMGAY DOOLA,"house, and left him naked to the night dews?"""
35664,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35665,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Nay. A hut is a hut, and it holds the life of a man. But once I sent"
35666,NAMGAY DOOLA,my army against him when his excuses became wearisome. Of their heads
35667,NAMGAY DOOLA,he brake three across the top with a stick. The other two men ran away.
35668,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Also the guns would not shoot."""
35669,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35670,NAMGAY DOOLA,I had seen the equipment of the infantry. One-third of it was an old
35671,NAMGAY DOOLA,muzzle-loading fowling-piece with ragged rust holes where the nipples
35672,NAMGAY DOOLA,should have been; one-third a wirebound matchlock with a worm-eaten
35673,NAMGAY DOOLA,"stock, and one-third a four-bore flint duck-gun, without a flint."
35674,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35675,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""But it is to be remembered,"" said the king, reaching out for the"
35676,NAMGAY DOOLA,"bottle, ""that he is a very expert log-snatcher and a man of a merry"
35677,NAMGAY DOOLA,"face. What shall I do to him, sahib?"""
35678,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35679,NAMGAY DOOLA,This was interesting. The timid hill-folk would as soon have refused

35682,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35683,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""If it be the king's permission,"" I said, ""I will not strike my tents"
35684,NAMGAY DOOLA,"till the third day, and I will see this man. The mercy of the king is"

35687,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35688,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""You have my leave to go,"" said the king."
35689,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35690,NAMGAY DOOLA,Next morning the crier went through the stare proclaiming that there was
35691,NAMGAY DOOLA,a log-jam on the river and that it behooved all loyal subjects to clear
35692,NAMGAY DOOLA,"it. The people poured down from their villages to the moist, warm valley"
35693,NAMGAY DOOLA,"of poppy fields, and the king and I went with them."
35694,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35695,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Hundreds of dressed deodar logs had caught on a snag of rock, and the"
35696,NAMGAY DOOLA,river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade.
35697,NAMGAY DOOLA,"The water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber, while the"
35698,NAMGAY DOOLA,"population of the state prodded at the nearest logs with poles, in"
35699,NAMGAY DOOLA,"the hope of easing the pressure. Then there went up a shout of ""Namgay"
35700,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Doola! Namgay Doola!"" and a large, red-haired villager hurried up,"
35701,NAMGAY DOOLA,stripping off his clothes as he ran.
35702,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35703,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""That he is. That is the rebel!"" said the king. ""Now will the dam be"
35704,NAMGAY DOOLA,"cleared."""
35705,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35706,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""But why has he red hair?"" I asked, since red hair among hill-folk is as"
35707,NAMGAY DOOLA,uncommon as blue or green.
35708,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35709,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""He is an outlander,"" said the king. ""Well done! Oh, well done!"""
35710,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35711,NAMGAY DOOLA,Namgay Doola had scrambled on the jam and was clawing out the butt of
35712,NAMGAY DOOLA,"a log with a rude sort of a boat-hook. It slid forward slowly, as an"
35713,NAMGAY DOOLA,"alligator moves, and three or four others followed it. The green water"
35714,NAMGAY DOOLA,spouted through the gaps. Then the villagers howled and shouted and
35715,NAMGAY DOOLA,"leaped among the logs, pulling and pushing the obstinate timber, and the"
35716,NAMGAY DOOLA,red head of Namgay Doola was chief among them all. The logs swayed and
35717,NAMGAY DOOLA,chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from up-stream battered the now
35718,NAMGAY DOOLA,"weakening dam. It gave way at last in a smother of foam, racing butts,"
35719,NAMGAY DOOLA,"bobbing black heads, and a confusion indescribable, as the river tossed"
35720,NAMGAY DOOLA,everything before it. I saw the red head go down with the last remnants
35721,NAMGAY DOOLA,of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks. It rose
35722,NAMGAY DOOLA,"close to the hank, and blowing like a grampus, Namgay Doola wiped the"
35723,NAMGAY DOOLA,water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the king.
35724,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35725,NAMGAY DOOLA,I had time to observe the man closely. The virulent redness of his shock
35726,NAMGAY DOOLA,"head and beard was most startling, and in the thicket of hair twinkled"
35727,NAMGAY DOOLA,above high cheek-bones two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an
35728,NAMGAY DOOLA,"outlander, but yet a Thibetan in language, habit and attire. He spoke"
35729,NAMGAY DOOLA,the Lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals. It
35730,NAMGAY DOOLA,was not so much a lisp as an accent.
35731,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35732,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Whence comest thou?"" I asked, wondering."
35733,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35734,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""From Thibet."" He pointed across the hills and grinned. That grin went"
35735,NAMGAY DOOLA,straight to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola
35736,NAMGAY DOOLA,took it. No pure Thibetan would have understood the meaning of the
35737,NAMGAY DOOLA,"gesture. He went away to look for his clothes, and as he climbed back to"
35738,NAMGAY DOOLA,"his village, I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar."
35739,NAMGAY DOOLA,It was the whooping of Namgay Doola.
35740,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35741,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""You see now,"" said the king, ""why I would not kill him. He is a bold"
35742,NAMGAY DOOLA,"man among my logs, but,"" and he shook his head like a schoolmaster, ""I"
35743,NAMGAY DOOLA,know that before long there will be complaints of him in the court. Let
35744,NAMGAY DOOLA,"us return to the palace and do justice."""
35745,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35746,NAMGAY DOOLA,It was that king's custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven
35747,NAMGAY DOOLA,and three o'clock. I heard him do justice equitably on weighty matters
35748,NAMGAY DOOLA,"of trespass, slander, and a little wife-stealing. Then his brow clouded"
35749,NAMGAY DOOLA,and he summoned me.
35750,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35751,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Again it is Namgay Doola,"" he said, despairingly. ""Not content with"
35752,NAMGAY DOOLA,"refusing revenue on his own part, he has bound half his village by an"
35753,NAMGAY DOOLA,oath to the like treason. Never before has such a thing befallen me! Nor
35754,NAMGAY DOOLA,"are my taxes heavy."""
35755,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35756,NAMGAY DOOLA,"A rabbit-faced villager, with a blush-rose stuck behind his ear,"
35757,NAMGAY DOOLA,"advanced trembling. He had been in Namgay Doola's conspiracy, but had"
35758,NAMGAY DOOLA,told everything and hoped for the king's favor.
35759,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35760,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Oh, king!"" said I, ""if it be the king's will, let this matter stand"
35761,NAMGAY DOOLA,"over till the morning. Only the gods can do right in a hurry, and it may"
35762,NAMGAY DOOLA,"be that yonder villager has lied."""
35763,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35764,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Nay, for I know the nature of Namgay Doola; but since a guest asks,"
35765,NAMGAY DOOLA,"let the matter remain. Wilt thou, for my sake, speak harshly to this"
35766,NAMGAY DOOLA,"red-headed outlander? He may listen to thee."""
35767,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35768,NAMGAY DOOLA,"I made an attempt that very evening, but for the life of me I could not"
35769,NAMGAY DOOLA,keep my countenance. Namgay Doola grinned so persuasively and began to
35770,NAMGAY DOOLA,tell me about a big brown bear in a poppy field by the river. Would
35771,NAMGAY DOOLA,I care to shoot that bear? I spoke austerely on the sin of detected
35772,NAMGAY DOOLA,conspiracy and the certainty of punishment. Namgay Doola's face clouded
35773,NAMGAY DOOLA,"for a moment. Shortly afterward he withdrew from my tent, and I heard"
35774,NAMGAY DOOLA,"him singing softly among the pines. The words were unintelligible to me,"
35775,NAMGAY DOOLA,"but the tune, like his liquid, insinuating speech, seemed the ghost of"
35776,NAMGAY DOOLA,something strangely familiar.
35777,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35778,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Dir hane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee,"" crooned Namgay Doola"
35779,NAMGAY DOOLA,"again and again, and I racked my brain for that lost tune. It was not"
35780,NAMGAY DOOLA,till after dinner that I discovered some one had cut a square foot of
35781,NAMGAY DOOLA,velvet from the centre of my best camera-cloth. This made me so angry
35782,NAMGAY DOOLA,that I wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown
35783,NAMGAY DOOLA,bear. I could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy
35784,NAMGAY DOOLA,field as I waited shoulder deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to catch
35785,NAMGAY DOOLA,him after his meal. The moon was at full and drew out the scent of the
35786,NAMGAY DOOLA,tasseled crop. Then I heard the anguished bellow of a Himalayan cow--one
35787,NAMGAY DOOLA,of the little black crummies no bigger than Newfoundland dogs. Two
35788,NAMGAY DOOLA,shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me. I was in
35789,NAMGAY DOOLA,the act of firing when I saw that each bore a brilliant red head. The
35790,NAMGAY DOOLA,lesser animal was trailing something rope-like that left a dark track
35791,NAMGAY DOOLA,"on the path. They were within six feet of me, and the shadow of the"
35792,NAMGAY DOOLA,moonlight lay velvet-black on their faces. Velvet-black was exactly the
35793,NAMGAY DOOLA,"word, for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet"
35794,NAMGAY DOOLA,"of my camera-cloth. I marveled, and went to bed."
35795,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35796,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Next morning the kingdom was in an uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had"
35797,NAMGAY DOOLA,gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a
35798,NAMGAY DOOLA,cow belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was
35799,NAMGAY DOOLA,"sacrilege unspeakable against the holy cow. The state desired his blood,"
35800,NAMGAY DOOLA,"but he had retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and windows with"
35801,NAMGAY DOOLA,"big stones, and defied the world."
35802,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35803,NAMGAY DOOLA,The king and I and the populace approached the hut cautiously. There was
35804,NAMGAY DOOLA,"no hope of capturing our man without loss of life, for from a hole in"
35805,NAMGAY DOOLA,the wall projected the muzzle of an extremely well-cared-for gun--the
35806,NAMGAY DOOLA,only gun in the state that could shoot. Namgay Doola had narrowly missed
35807,NAMGAY DOOLA,a villager just before we came up.
35808,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35809,NAMGAY DOOLA,The standing army stood.
35810,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35811,NAMGAY DOOLA,"It could do no more, for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew"
35812,NAMGAY DOOLA,from the windows. To these were added from time to time showers of
35813,NAMGAY DOOLA,scalding water. We saw red beads bobbing up and down within. The family
35814,NAMGAY DOOLA,of Namgay Doola were aiding their sire. Blood-curdling yells of defiance
35815,NAMGAY DOOLA,were the only answer to our prayers.
35816,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35817,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Never,"" said the king, puffing, ""has such a thing befallen my state."
35818,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Next year I will certainly buy a little cannon."" He looked at me"
35819,NAMGAY DOOLA,imploringly.
35820,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35821,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen?"" said I, for"
35822,NAMGAY DOOLA,a light was beginning to break upon me.
35823,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35824,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""He worships his own god,"" said the prime minister. ""We can but starve"
35825,NAMGAY DOOLA,"him out."""
35826,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35827,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Let the white man approach,"" said Namgay Doola from within. ""All others"
35828,NAMGAY DOOLA,"I will kill. Send me the white man."""
35829,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35830,NAMGAY DOOLA,The door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a Thibetan
35831,NAMGAY DOOLA,hut crammed with children. And every child had flaming red hair. A
35832,NAMGAY DOOLA,"freshgathered cow's tail lay on the floor, and by its side two pieces"
35833,NAMGAY DOOLA,of black velvet--my black velvet--rudely hacked into the semblance of
35834,NAMGAY DOOLA,masks.
35835,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35836,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""And what is this shame, Namgay Doola?"" I asked."
35837,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35838,NAMGAY DOOLA,"He grinned more charmingly than ever. ""There is no shame,"" said he. ""I"
35839,NAMGAY DOOLA,did but cut off the tail of that man's cow. He betrayed me. I was minded
35840,NAMGAY DOOLA,"to shoot him, sahib, but not to death. Indeed, not to death; only in the"
35841,NAMGAY DOOLA,"legs."""
35842,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35843,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king? Why"
35844,NAMGAY DOOLA,"at all?"""
35845,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35846,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""By the god of my father, I cannot tell,"" said Namgay Doola."
35847,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35848,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""And who was thy father?"""
35849,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35850,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""The same that had this gun."" He showed me his weapon, a Tower musket,"
35851,NAMGAY DOOLA,bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the Honorable East India Company.
35852,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35853,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""And thy father's name?"" said I."
35854,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35855,NAMGAY DOOLA,"He obeyed, and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech"
35856,NAMGAY DOOLA,"came. ""Thimla Dhula!"" said he, excitedly. ""To this hour I worship his"
35857,NAMGAY DOOLA,"god."""
35858,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35859,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""May I see that god?"""
35860,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35861,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""In a little while--at twilight time."""
35862,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35863,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Rememberest thou aught of thy father's speech?"""
35864,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35865,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""It is long ago. But there was one word which he said often. Thus,"
35866,NAMGAY DOOLA,"''Shun!' Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet, our hands to our"
35867,NAMGAY DOOLA,"sides, thus."""
35868,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35869,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Even so. And what was thy mother?"""
35870,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35871,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""A woman of the Hills. We be Lepchas of Darjiling, but me they call an"
35872,NAMGAY DOOLA,"outlander because my hair is as thou seest."""
35873,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35874,NAMGAY DOOLA,"The Thibetan woman, his wife, touched him on the arm gently. The long"
35875,NAMGAY DOOLA,parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day. It was now close
35876,NAMGAY DOOLA,upon twilight--the hour of the Angelus. Very solemnly the red-headed
35877,NAMGAY DOOLA,brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle. Namgay Doola laid his
35878,NAMGAY DOOLA,"gun aside, lighted a little oil-lamp, and set it before a recess in"
35879,NAMGAY DOOLA,"the wall. Pulling back a wisp of dirty cloth, he revealed a worn brass"
35880,NAMGAY DOOLA,crucifix leaning against the helmet badge of a long-forgotten East India
35881,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Company's regiment. ""Thus did my father,"" he said, crossing himself"
35882,NAMGAY DOOLA,"clumsily. The wife and children followed suit. Then, all together, they"
35883,NAMGAY DOOLA,struck up the wailing cham that I heard on the hillside:
35884,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35885,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Dir bane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee."""
35886,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35887,NAMGAY DOOLA,"I was puzzled no longer. Again and again they sung, as if their hearts"
35888,NAMGAY DOOLA,"would break, their version of the chorus of ""The Wearing of the Green"":"
35889,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35890,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""They're hanging men and women, too,"
35891,NAMGAY DOOLA,"For the wearing of the green,"""
35892,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35893,NAMGAY DOOLA,"A diabolical inspiration came to me. One of the brats, a boy about eight"
35894,NAMGAY DOOLA,years old--could he have been in the fields last night?--was watching
35895,NAMGAY DOOLA,"me as he sung. I pulled out a rupee, held the coin between finger and"
35896,NAMGAY DOOLA,"thumb, and looked--only looked--at the gun leaning against the wall."
35897,NAMGAY DOOLA,A grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread his
35898,NAMGAY DOOLA,"porringer-like face. Never for an instant stopping the song, he held out"
35899,NAMGAY DOOLA,"his hand for the money, and then slid the gun to my hand. I might"
35900,NAMGAY DOOLA,"have shot Namgay Doola dead as he chanted, but I was satisfied. The"
35901,NAMGAY DOOLA,inevitable blood-instinct held true. Namgay Doola drew the curtain
35902,NAMGAY DOOLA,across the recess. Angelus was over.
35903,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35904,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Thus my father sung. There was much more, but I have forgotten, and I"
35905,NAMGAY DOOLA,"do not know the purport of even these words, but it may be that the god"
35906,NAMGAY DOOLA,"will understand. I am not of this people, and I will not pay revenue."""
35907,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35908,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""And why?"""
35909,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35910,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Again that soul-compelling grin. ""What occupation would be to me between"
35911,NAMGAY DOOLA,crop and crop? It is better than scaring bears. But these people do not
35912,NAMGAY DOOLA,"understand."""
35913,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35914,NAMGAY DOOLA,He picked the masks off the floor and looked in my face as simply as a
35915,NAMGAY DOOLA,child.
35916,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35917,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""By what road didst thou attain knowledge to make those deviltries?"" I"
35918,NAMGAY DOOLA,"said, pointing."
35919,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35920,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""I cannot tell. I am but a Lepcha of Darjiling, and yet the stuff""--"
35921,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35922,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Which thou hast stolen,"" said I."
35923,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35924,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Nay, surely. Did I steal? I desired it so. The stuff--the stuff. What"
35925,NAMGAY DOOLA,"else should I have done with the stuff?"" He twisted the velvet between"
35926,NAMGAY DOOLA,his fingers.
35927,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35928,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""But the sin of maiming the cow--consider that."""
35929,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35930,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Oh, sahib, the man betrayed me; the heifer's tail waved in the"
35931,NAMGAY DOOLA,"moonlight, and I had my knife. What else should I have done? The tail"
35932,NAMGAY DOOLA,"came off ere I was aware. Sahib, thou knowest more than I."""
35933,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35934,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""That is true,"" said I. ""Stay within the door. I go to speak to the"
35935,NAMGAY DOOLA,"king."" The population of the state were ranged on the hillside. I went"
35936,NAMGAY DOOLA,forth and spoke.
35937,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35938,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""O king,"" said I, ""touching this man, there be two courses open to thy"
35939,NAMGAY DOOLA,wisdom. Thou canst either hang him from a tree--him and his brood--till
35940,NAMGAY DOOLA,"there remains no hair that is red within thy land."""
35941,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35942,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Nay,"" said the king. ""Why should I hurt the little children?"""
35943,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35944,NAMGAY DOOLA,They had poured out of the hut and were making plump obeisances to
35945,NAMGAY DOOLA,everybody. Namgay Doola waited at the door with his gun across his arm.
35946,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35947,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Or thou canst, discarding their impiety of the cow-maiming, raise him"
35948,NAMGAY DOOLA,to honor in thy army. He comes of a race that will not pay revenue. A
35949,NAMGAY DOOLA,red flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that
35950,NAMGAY DOOLA,glowing hair. Make him chief of thy army. Give him honor as may befall
35951,NAMGAY DOOLA,"and full allowance of work, but look to it, oh, king, that neither he"
35952,NAMGAY DOOLA,nor his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward. Feed him with words
35953,NAMGAY DOOLA,"and favor, and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of,"
35954,NAMGAY DOOLA,and he will be a bulwark of defense. But deny him even a tuftlet of
35955,NAMGAY DOOLA,"grass for his own. This is the nature that God has given him. Moreover,"
35956,NAMGAY DOOLA,"he has brethren""--"
35957,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35958,NAMGAY DOOLA,The state groaned unanimously.
35959,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35960,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""But if his brethren come they will surely fight with each other till"
35961,NAMGAY DOOLA,they die; or else the one will always give information concerning the

35963,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35964,NAMGAY DOOLA,"The king bowed his head, and I said:"
35965,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35966,NAMGAY DOOLA,"""Come forth, Namgay Doola, and command the king's army. Thy name shall"
35967,NAMGAY DOOLA,"no more be Namgay in the mouths of men, but Patsay Doola, for, as thou"
35968,NAMGAY DOOLA,"hast truly said, I know."""
35969,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35970,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Then Namgay Doola, never christened Patsay Doola, son of Timlay"
35971,NAMGAY DOOLA,"Doola--which is Tim Doolan--clasped the king's feet, cuffed the standing"
35972,NAMGAY DOOLA,"army, and hurried in an agony of contrition from temple to temple making"
35973,NAMGAY DOOLA,offerings for the sin of the cattle--maiming.
35974,NAMGAY DOOLA,
35975,NAMGAY DOOLA,And the king was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to
35976,NAMGAY DOOLA,sell me a village for 20 pounds sterling. But I buy no village in
35977,NAMGAY DOOLA,the Himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the
35978,NAMGAY DOOLA,heaven-climbing glacier and the dark birch forest.

35985,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY
35986,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
35987,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Imray had achieved the impossible. Without warning, for no conceivable"
35988,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"motive, in his youth and at the threshold of his career he had chosen"
35989,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"to disappear from the world--which is to say, the little Indian station"
35990,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"where he lived. Upon a day he was alive, well, happy, and in great"
35991,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"evidence at his club, among the billiard-tables. Upon a morning he was"
35992,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"not, and no manner of search could make sure where he might be. He"
35993,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,had stepped out of his place; he had not appeared at his office at the
35994,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"proper time, and his dog-cart was not upon the public roads. For these"
35995,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,reasons and because he was hampering in a microscopical degree the
35996,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"administration of the Indian Empire, the Indian Empire paused for one"
35997,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,microscopical moment to make inquiry into the fate of Imray. Ponds were
35998,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"dragged, wells were plumbed, telegrams were dispatched down the lines"
35999,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"of railways and to the nearest seaport town--1,200 miles away--but Imray"
36000,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"was not at the end of the drag-ropes nor the telegrams. He was gone,"
36001,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,and his place knew him no more. Then the work of the great Indian Empire
36002,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"swept forward, because it could not be delayed, and Imray, from being a"
36003,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"man, became a mystery--such a thing as men talk over at their tables"
36004,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"in the club for a month and then forget utterly. His guns, horses, and"
36005,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,carts were sold to the highest bidder. His superior officer wrote
36006,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"an absurd letter to his mother, saying that Imray had unaccountably"
36007,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,disappeared and his bungalow stood empty on the road.
36008,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36009,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"After three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by,"
36010,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"my friend Strickland, of the police force, saw fit to rent the bungalow"
36011,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,from the native landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss
36012,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Youghal--an affair which has been described in another place--and while
36013,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,he was pursuing his investigations into native life. His own life was
36014,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"sufficiently peculiar, and men complained of his manners and customs."
36015,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"There was always food in his house, but there were no regular times for"
36016,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"meals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he might find on"
36017,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"the sideboard, and this is not good for the insides of human beings."
36018,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"His domestic equipment was limited to six rifles, three shotguns, five"
36019,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"saddles, and a collection of stiff-jointed masheer rods, bigger and"
36020,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,stronger than the largest salmon rods. These things occupied one half of
36021,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"his bungalow, and the other half was given up to Strickland and his dog"
36022,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Tietjens--an enormous Rampur slut, who sung when she was ordered, and"
36023,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,devoured daily the rations of two men. She spoke to Strickland in a
36024,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"language of her own, and whenever, in her walks abroad she saw things"
36025,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the Queen Empress, she"
36026,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,returned to her master and gave him information. Strickland would
36027,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"take steps at once, and the end of his labors was trouble and fine and"
36028,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,imprisonment for other people. The natives believed that Tietjens was a
36029,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"familiar spirit, and treated her with the great reverence that is born"
36030,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,of hate and fear One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special
36031,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"use. She owned a bedstead, a blanket, and a drinking-trough, and if any"
36032,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"one came into Strickland's room at night, her custom was to knock down"
36033,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the invader and give tongue till some one came with a light. Strickland
36034,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,owes his life to her. When he was on the frontier in search of the local
36035,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,murderer who came in the grey dawn to send Strickland much further
36036,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"than the Andaman Islands, Tietjens caught him as he was crawling into"
36037,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Strickland's tent with a dagger between his teeth, and after his record"
36038,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"of iniquity was established in the eyes of the law, he was hanged. From"
36039,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,that date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver and employed a monogram
36040,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"on her night blanket, and the blanket was double-woven Kashmir cloth,"
36041,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,for she was a delicate dog.
36042,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36043,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Under no circumstances would she be separated from Strickland, and when"
36044,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,he was ill with fever she made great trouble for the doctors because she
36045,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,did not know how to help her master and would not allow another creature
36046,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"to attempt aid. Macarnaght, of the Indian Medical Service, beat her over"
36047,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"the head with a gun, before she could understand that she must give room"
36048,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,for those who could give quinine.
36049,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36050,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"A short time after Strickland had taken Imray's bungalow, my business"
36051,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"took me through that station, and naturally, the club quarters being"
36052,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"full, I quartered myself upon Strickland. It was a desirable bungalow,"
36053,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"eight-roomed, and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from"
36054,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"rain. Under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling cloth, which looked just"
36055,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,as nice as a whitewashed ceiling. The landlord had repainted it when
36056,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Strickland took the bungalow, and unless you knew how Indian bungalows"
36057,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,were built you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the
36058,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"dark, three-cornered cavern of the roof, where the beams and the under"
36059,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"side of the thatch harbored all manner of rats, hats, ants, and other"
36060,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,things.
36061,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36062,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Tietjens met me in the veranda with a bay like the boom of the bells of
36063,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"St. Paul's, and put her paws on my shoulders and said she was glad to"
36064,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,see me. Strickland had contrived to put together that sort of meal which
36065,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"he called lunch, and immediately after it was finished went out about"
36066,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,his business. I was left alone with Tietjens and my own affairs. The
36067,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,heat of the summer had broken up and given place to the warm damp of
36068,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"the rains. There was no motion in the heated air, but the rain fell like"
36069,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"bayonet rods on the earth, and flung up a blue mist where it splashed"
36070,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"back again. The bamboos and the custard apples, the poinsettias and"
36071,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the mango-trees in the garden stood still while the warm water lashed
36072,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"through them, and the frogs began to sing among the aloe hedges. A"
36073,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"little before the light failed, and when the rain was at its worst, I"
36074,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"sat in the back veranda and heard the water roar from the eaves, and"
36075,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,scratched myself because I was covered with the thing they called
36076,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"prickly heat. Tietjens came out with me and put her head in my lap, and"
36077,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"was very sorrowful, so I gave her biscuits when tea was ready, and I"
36078,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,took tea in the back veranda on account of the little coolness I
36079,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,found there. The rooms of the house were dark behind me. I could smell
36080,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Strickland's saddlery and the oil on his guns, and I did not the least"
36081,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,desire to sit among these things. My own servant came to me in the
36082,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"twilight, the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched"
36083,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"body, and told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see some"
36084,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"one. Very much against my will, and because of the darkness of the"
36085,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"rooms, I went into the naked drawing-room, telling my man to bring the"
36086,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,lights. There might or might not have been a caller in the room--it
36087,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"seems to me that I saw a figure by one of the windows, but when the"
36088,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,lights came there was nothing save the spikes of the rain without and
36089,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the smell of the drinking earth in my nostrils. I explained to my man
36090,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"that he was no wiser than he ought to be, and went back to the veranda"
36091,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,to talk to Tietjens. She had gone out into the wet and I could hardly
36092,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,coax her back to me--even with biscuits with sugar on top. Strickland
36093,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"rode back, dripping wet, just before dinner, and the first thing he said"
36094,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,was:
36095,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36096,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Has any one called?"""
36097,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36098,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I explained, with apologies, that my servant had called me into the"
36099,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,drawing-room on a false alarm; or that some loafer had tried to call
36100,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"on Strickland, and, thinking better of it, fled after giving his name."
36101,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Strickland ordered dinner without comment, and since it was a real"
36102,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"dinner, with white tablecloth attached, we sat down."
36103,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36104,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"At nine o'clock Strickland wanted to go to bed, and I was tired too."
36105,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Tietjens, who had been lying underneath the table, rose up and went into"
36106,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"the least exposed veranda as soon as her master moved to his own room,"
36107,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,which was next to the stately chamber set apart for Tietjens. If a mere
36108,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"wife had wished to sleep out-of-doors in that pelting rain, it would not"
36109,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"have mattered, but Tietjens was a dog, and therefore the better animal."
36110,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I looked at Strickland, expecting to see him flog her with a whip. He"
36111,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"smiled queerly, as a man would smile after telling some hideous domestic"
36112,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"tragedy. ""She has done this ever since I moved in here."""
36113,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36114,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"The dog was Strickland's dog, so I said nothing, but I felt all that"
36115,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Strickland felt in being made light of. Tietjens encamped outside my
36116,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"bedroom window, and storm after storm came up, thundered on the thatch,"
36117,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,and died away. The lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spattered
36118,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"a barn door, but the light was pale blue, not yellow; and looking"
36119,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"through my slit bamboo blinds, I could see the great dog standing, not"
36120,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"sleeping, in the veranda, the hackles alift on her back, and her feet"
36121,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,planted as tensely as the drawn wire rope of a suspension bridge. In the
36122,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"very short pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep, but it seemed that"
36123,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"some one wanted me very badly. He, whoever he was, was trying to call"
36124,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"me by name, but his voice was no more than a husky whisper. Then the"
36125,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,thunder ceased and Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low
36126,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"moon. Somebody tried to open my door, and walked about and through the"
36127,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"house, and stood breathing heavily in the verandas, and just when I was"
36128,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,falling asleep I fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamoring
36129,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,above my head or on the door.
36130,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36131,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I ran into Strickland's room and asked him whether he was ill and had
36132,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"been calling for me. He was lying on the bed half-dressed, with a pipe"
36133,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"in his mouth. ""I thought you'd come,"" he said. ""Have I been walking"
36134,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"around the house at all?"""
36135,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36136,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I explained that he had been in the dining-room and the smoking-room and
36137,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,two or three other places; and he laughed and told me to go back to bed.
36138,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I went back to bed and slept till the morning, but in all my dreams"
36139,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I was sure I was doing some one an injustice in not attending to
36140,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"his wants. What those wants were I could not tell, but a fluttering,"
36141,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"whispering, bolt-fumbling, luring, loitering some one was reproaching"
36142,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"me for my slackness, and through all the dreams I heard the howling of"
36143,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Tietjens in the garden and the thrashing of the rain.
36144,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36145,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I was in that house for two days, and Strickland went to his office"
36146,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"daily, leaving me alone for eight or ten hours a day, with Tietjens for"
36147,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"my only companion. As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable,"
36148,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,and so was Tietjens; but in the twilight she and I moved into the back
36149,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"veranda and cuddled each other for company. We were alone in the house,"
36150,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,but for all that it was fully occupied by a tenant with whom I had
36151,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"no desire to interfere. I never saw him, but I could see the curtains"
36152,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,between the rooms quivering where he had just passed through; I could
36153,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,hear the chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had
36154,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,just quitted them; and I could feel when I went to get a book from
36155,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the dining-room that somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front
36156,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,veranda till I should have gone away. Tietjens made the twilight more
36157,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"interesting by glaring into the darkened rooms, with every hair erect,"
36158,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,and following the motions of something that I could not see. She never
36159,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"entered the rooms, but her eyes moved, and that was quite sufficient."
36160,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Only when my servant came to trim the lamps and make all light and
36161,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"habitable, she would come in with me and spend her time sitting on her"
36162,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,haunches watching an invisible extra man as he moved about behind my
36163,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,shoulder. Dogs are cheerful companions.
36164,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36165,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I explained to Strickland, gently as might be, that I would go over to"
36166,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"the club and find for myself quarters there. I admired his hospitality,"
36167,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"was pleased with his guns and rods, but I did not much care for his"
36168,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"house and its atmosphere. He heard me out to the end, and then smiled"
36169,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"very wearily, but without contempt, for he is a man who understands"
36170,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"things. ""Stay on,"" he said, ""and see what this thing means. All you have"
36171,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,talked about I have known since I took the bungalow. Stay on and wait.
36172,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Tietjens has left me. Are you going too?"""
36173,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36174,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I had seen him through one little affair connected with an idol that had
36175,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum, and I had no desire to help"
36176,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,him through further experiences. He was a man to whom unpleasantnesses
36177,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,arrived as do dinners to ordinary people.
36178,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36179,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Therefore I explained more clearly than ever that I liked him immensely,"
36180,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"and would be happy to see him in the daytime, but that I didn't care to"
36181,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"sleep under his roof. This was after dinner, when Tietjens had gone out"
36182,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,to lie in the veranda.
36183,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36184,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""'Pon my soul, I don't wonder,"" said Strickland, with his eyes on the"
36185,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"ceiling-cloth. ""Look at that."""
36186,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36187,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,The tails of two snakes were hanging between the cloth and the cornice
36188,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"of the wall. They threw long shadows in the lamp-light. ""If you are"
36189,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"afraid of snakes, of course""--said Strickland. ""I hate and fear snakes,"
36190,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,because if you look into the eyes of any snake you will see that it
36191,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"knows all and more of man's fall, and that it feels all the contempt"
36192,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,that the devil felt when Adam was evicted from Eden. Besides which its
36193,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"bite is generally fatal, and it bursts up trouser legs."""
36194,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36195,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""You ought to get your thatch over-hauled,"" I said. ""Give me a masheer"
36196,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"rod, and we'll poke 'em down."""
36197,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36198,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""They'll hide among the roof beams,"" said Strickland. ""I can't stand"
36199,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"snakes overhead. I'm going up. If I shake 'em down, stand by with a"
36200,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"cleaning-rod and break their backs."""
36201,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36202,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I was not anxious to assist Strickland in his work, but I took the"
36203,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"loading-rod and waited in the dining-room, while Strickland brought a"
36204,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,gardener's ladder from the veranda and set it against the side of the
36205,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,room. The snake tails drew themselves up and disappeared. We could hear
36206,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the dry rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy cloth.
36207,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Strickland took a lamp with him, while I tried to make clear the danger"
36208,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"of hunting roof snakes between a ceiling cloth and a thatch, apart from"
36209,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the deterioration of property caused by ripping out ceiling-cloths.
36210,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36211,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""N o n s en s e,"" said Strickland. ""They're sure to hide near the walls"
36212,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"by the cloth. The bricks are too cold for 'em, and the heat of the room"
36213,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"is just what they like."" He put his hands to the corner of the cloth"
36214,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,and ripped the rotten stuff from the cornice. It gave great sound of
36215,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"tearing, and Strickland put his head through the opening into the"
36216,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,dark of the angle of the roof beams. I set my teeth and lifted the
36217,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"loading-rod, for I had not the least knowledge of what might descend."
36218,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36219,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""H'm,"" said Strickland; and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof."
36220,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""There's room for another set of rooms up here, and, by Jove! some one"
36221,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"is occupying em."""
36222,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36223,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Snakes?"" I said down below."
36224,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36225,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""No. It's a buffalo. Hand me up the two first joints of a masheer rod,"
36226,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"and I'll prod it. It's lying on the main beam."""
36227,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36228,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I handed up the rod.
36229,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36230,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""What a nest for owls and serpents! No wonder the snakes live here,"""
36231,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"said Strickland, climbing further into the roof. I could see his elbow"
36232,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"thrusting with the rod. ""Come out of that, whoever you are! Look out!"
36233,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Heads below there! It's tottering."""
36234,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36235,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I saw the ceiling-cloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a
36236,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,shape that was pressing it downward and downward toward the lighted
36237,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,lamps on the table. I snatched a lamp out of danger and stood back. Then
36238,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"the cloth ripped out from the walls, tore, split, swayed, and shot down"
36239,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,upon the table something that I dared not look at till Strickland had
36240,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,slid down the ladder and was standing by my side.
36241,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36242,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"He did not say much, being a man of few words, but he picked up the"
36243,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,loose end of the table-cloth and threw it over the thing on the table.
36244,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36245,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""It strikes me,"" said he, pulling down the lamp, ""our friend Imray has"
36246,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"come back. Oh! you would, would you?"""
36247,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36248,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"There was a movement under the cloth, and a little snake wriggled out,"
36249,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,to be back-broken by the butt of the masheer rod. I was sufficiently
36250,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,sick to make no remarks worth recording.
36251,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36252,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Strickland meditated and helped himself to drinks liberally. The thing
36253,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,under the cloth made no more signs of life.
36254,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36255,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Is it Imray?"" I said."
36256,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36257,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Strickland turned back the cloth for a moment and looked. ""It is Imray,"""
36258,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"he said, ""and his throat is cut from ear to ear."""
36259,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36260,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Then we spoke both together and to ourselves:
36261,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36262,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""That's why he whispered about the house."""
36263,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36264,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Tietjens, in the garden, began to bay furiously. A little later her"
36265,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,great nose heaved upon the dining-room door.
36266,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36267,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,She sniffed and was still. The broken and tattered ceiling-cloth hung
36268,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"down almost to the level of the table, and there was hardly room to move"
36269,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,away from the discovery.
36270,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36271,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Then Tietjens came in and sat down, her teeth bared and her forepaws"
36272,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,planted. She looked at Strickland.
36273,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36274,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""It's bad business, old lady,"" said he. ""Men don't go up into the roofs"
36275,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"of their bungalows to die, and they don't fasten up the ceiling-cloth"
36276,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"behind 'em. Let's think it out."""
36277,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36278,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Let's think it out somewhere else,"" I said."
36279,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36280,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Excellent idea! Turn the lamps out. We'll get into my room."""
36281,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36282,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,I did not turn the lamps out. I went into Strickland's room first and
36283,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"allowed him to make the darkness. Then he followed me, and we lighted"
36284,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,tobacco and thought. Strickland did the thinking. I smoked furiously
36285,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,because I was afraid.
36286,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36287,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Imray is back,"" said Strickland. ""The question is, who killed Imray?"
36288,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,Don't talk--I have a notion of my own. When I took this bungalow I took
36289,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"most of Imray's servants. Imray was guileless and inoffensive, wasn't"
36290,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"he?"""
36291,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36292,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"I agreed, though the heap under the cloth looked neither one thing nor"
36293,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,the other.
36294,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36295,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""If I call the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie like"
36296,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"Aryans. What do you suggest?"""
36297,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36298,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""Call 'em in one by one,"" I said."
36299,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36300,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,"""They'll run away and give the news to all their fellows,"" said"

36463,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,

36469,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36470,THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY,
36471,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER
36472,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36473,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,ONCE upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who wished to clear
36474,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,some forest land for coffee-planting. When he had cut down all the
36475,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"trees and burned the underwood, the stumps still remained. Dynamite is"
36476,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,expensive and slow fire slow. The happy medium for stump-clearing is the
36477,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"lord of all beasts, who is the elephant. He will either push the stump"
36478,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"out of the ground with his tusks, if he has any, or drag it out with"
36479,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"ropes. The planter, therefore, hired elephants by ones and twos and"
36480,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"threes, and fell to work. The very best of all the elephants belonged to"
36481,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts; and this superior beast's
36482,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"name was Moti Guj. He was the absolute property of his mahout, which"
36483,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,would never have been the case under native rule; for Moti Guj was a
36484,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"creature to be desired by kings, and his name, being translated, meant"
36485,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"the Pearl Elephant. Because the British government was in the land,"
36486,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Deesa, the mahout, enjoyed his property undisturbed. He was dissipated."
36487,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"When he had made much money through the strength of his elephant, he"
36488,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,would get extremely drunk and give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg
36489,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,over the tender nails of the forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled the life
36490,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"out of Deesa on these occasions, for he knew that after the beating was"
36491,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"over, Deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and"
36492,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"his life and the liver of his soul, and give him some liquor. Moti"
36493,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Guj was very fond of liquor--arrack for choice, though he would drink"
36494,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,palm-tree toddy if nothing better offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep
36495,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"between Moti Guj's forefeet, and as Deesa generally chose the middle of"
36496,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"the public road, and as Moti Guj mounted guard over him, and would not"
36497,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"permit horse, foot, or cart to pass by, traffic was congested till Deesa"
36498,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,saw fit to wake up.
36499,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36500,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter's clearing: the
36501,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,wages were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj's neck and gave him
36502,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"orders, while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps--for he owned a magnificent"
36503,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,pair of tusks; or pulled at the end of a rope--for he had a magnificent
36504,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,pair of shoulders--while Deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he
36505,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,was the king of elephants. At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his
36506,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"three hundred pounds' weight of green food with a quart of arrack, and"
36507,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Deesa would take a share, and sing songs between Moti Guj's legs till it"
36508,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"was time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led Moti Guj down to the river,"
36509,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"and Moti Gui lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows, while Deesa"
36510,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,went over him with a coir swab and a brick. Moti Guj never mistook the
36511,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,pounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him
36512,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,to get up and turn over on the other side. Then Deesa would look at his
36513,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"feet and examine his eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in"
36514,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,case of sores or budding ophthalmia. After inspection the two would come
36515,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"up with a song from the sea, Moti Guj, all black and shining, waving a"
36516,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"torn tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting up"
36517,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,his own long wet hair.
36518,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36519,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"It was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of the"
36520,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,desire to drink deep. He wished for an orgy. The little draughts that
36521,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,led nowhere were taking the manhood out of him.
36522,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36523,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"He went to the planter, and ""My mother's dead,"" said he, weeping."

36530,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Deesa, weeping more than ever. ""She has left eighteen small children"

36579,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36580,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj's eyes twinkled. He liked jaunts as well as his master. One
36581,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,could snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then.
36582,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36583,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""But you, you fussy old pig, must stay behind and work."""
36584,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36585,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,The twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted. He hated
36586,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,stump-hauling on the plantation. It hurt his teeth.
36587,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36588,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""I shall be gone for ten days, oh, delectable one! Hold up your near"
36589,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"forefoot and I'll impress the fact upon it, warty toad of a dried"
36590,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"mud-puddle."" Deesa took a tent-peg and banged Moti Guj ten times on the"
36591,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,nails. Moti Guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot.
36592,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36593,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Ten days,"" said Deesa, ""you will work and haul and root the trees as"
36594,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun here shall order you. Take up Chihun and set him on your neck!"""
36595,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj curled the tip of his trunk, Chihun put his foot there, and"
36596,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,was swung on to the neck. Deesa handed Chihun the heavy ankus--the iron
36597,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,elephant goad.
36598,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36599,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Chihun thumped Moti Guj's bald head as a paver thumps a curbstone.
36600,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36601,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj trumpeted.
36602,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36603,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Be still, hog of the backwoods! Chihun's your mahout for ten days. And"
36604,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"now bid me goodbye, beast after mine own heart. Oh, my lord, my king!"
36605,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Jewel of all created elephants, lily of the herd, preserve your honored"
36606,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"health; be virtuous. Adieu!"""
36607,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36608,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into the air twice.
36609,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,That was his way of bidding him goodbye.
36610,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36611,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""He'll work now,"" said Deesa to the planter. ""Have I leave to go?"""
36612,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36613,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"The planter nodded, and Deesa dived into the woods. Moti Guj went back"
36614,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,to haul stumps.
36615,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36616,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun was very kind to him, but he felt unhappy and forlorn for all"
36617,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"that. Chihun gave him a ball of spices, and tickled him under the chin,"
36618,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"and Chihun's little baby cooed to him after work was over, and Chihun's"
36619,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"wife called him a darling; but Moti Guj was a bachelor by instinct, as"
36620,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Deesa was. He did not understand the domestic emotions. He wanted the
36621,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"light of his universe back again--the drink and the drunken slumber, the"
36622,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,savage beatings and the savage caresses.
36623,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36624,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"None the less he worked well, and the planter wondered. Deesa had"
36625,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,wandered along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own
36626,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"caste, and, drinking, dancing, and tippling, had drifted with it past"
36627,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,all knowledge of the lapse of time.
36628,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36629,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"The morning of the eleventh day dawned, and there returned no Deesa,"
36630,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint. He swung clear,"
36631,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"looked round, shrugged his shoulders, and began to walk away, as one"
36632,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,having business elsewhere.
36633,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36634,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Hi! ho! Come back you!"" shouted Chihun. ""Come back and put me on your"
36635,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"neck, misborn mountain! Return, splendor of the hillsides! Adornment of"
36636,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"all India, heave to, or I'll bang every toe off your forefoot!"""
36637,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36638,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after him with a"
36639,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"rope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears forward, and Chihun knew"
36640,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"what that meant, though he tried to carry it off with high words."
36641,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36642,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""None of your nonsense with me,"" said he. ""To your pickets, devil-son!"""
36643,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36644,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Hrrump!"" said Moti Guj, and that was all--that and the forebent ears."
36645,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36646,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets, chewed a branch for a toothpick,"
36647,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"and strolled about the clearing, making fun of the other elephants who"
36648,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,had just set to work.
36649,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36650,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came out with"
36651,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,a dog-whip and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid the white man
36652,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the
36653,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"clearing and ""Hrrumphing"" him into his veranda. Then he stood outside"
36654,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"the house, chuckling to himself and shaking all over with the fun of it,"
36655,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,as an elephant will.
36656,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36657,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""We'll thrash him,"" said the planter. ""He shall have the finest"
36658,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,thrashing ever elephant received. Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve foot of
36659,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"chain apiece, and tell them to lay on twenty."""
36660,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36661,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Kala Nag--which means Black Snake--and Nazim were two of the biggest
36662,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"elephants in the lines, and one of their duties was to administer the"
36663,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"graver punishment, since no man can beat an elephant properly."
36664,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36665,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,They took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their trunks as they
36666,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"sidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between them. Moti Guj had"
36667,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"never, in all his life of thirty-nine years, been whipped, and he did"
36668,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"not intend to begin a new experience. So he waited, waving his head from"
36669,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"right to left, and measuring the precise spot in Kala Nag's fat side"
36670,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,where a blunt tusk could sink deepest. Kala Nag had no tusks; the chain
36671,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"was the badge of his authority; but for all that, he swung wide of Moti"
36672,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Guj at the last minute, and tried to appear as if he had brought the"
36673,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,chain out for amusement. Nazim turned round and went home early. He did
36674,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"not feel fighting fit that morning, and so Moti Guj was left standing"
36675,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,alone with his ears cocked.
36676,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36677,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"That decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled back to"
36678,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,his amateur inspection of the clearing. An elephant who will not work
36679,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,and is not tied up is about as manageable as an eighty-one-ton gun loose
36680,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,in a heavy seaway. He slapped old friends on the back and asked them if
36681,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the stumps were coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning
36682,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"labor and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long 'nooning'; and,"
36683,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"wandering to and fro, he thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown,"
36684,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,when he returned to his picket for food.
36685,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36686,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""If you won't work, you sha'n't eat,"" said Chihun, angrily. ""You're a"
36687,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"wild elephant, and no educated animal at all. Go back to your jungle."""
36688,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36689,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun's little brown baby was rolling on the floor of the hut, and"
36690,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,stretching out its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway. Moti Guj
36691,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung out
36692,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby threw"
36693,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"itself, shouting, upon it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the"
36694,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his father's head.
36695,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36696,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Great Lord!"" said Chihun. ""Flour cakes of the best, twelve in number,"
36697,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"two feet across and soaked in rum, shall be yours on the instant, and"
36698,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,two hundred pounds weight of fresh-cut young sugar-cane therewith. Deign
36699,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,only to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my
36700,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"life to me!"""
36701,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36702,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet, that"
36703,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"could have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun's hut, and waited for his"
36704,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"food. He ate it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj dozed and"
36705,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,thought of Deesa. One of many mysteries connected with the elephant is
36706,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives. Four
36707,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"or five hours in the night suffice--two just before midnight, lying down"
36708,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"on one side; two just after one o'clock, lying down on the other. The"
36709,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting, and long"
36710,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,grumbling soliloquies.
36711,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36712,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for a"
36713,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,thought had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in
36714,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the dark forest with none to look after him. So all that night he chased
36715,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"through the undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears. He"
36716,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,went down to the river and blared across the shallows where Deesa used
36717,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"to wash him, but there was no answer. He could not find Deesa, but he"
36718,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"disturbed all the other elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened to"
36719,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,death some gypsies in the woods.
36720,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36721,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very drunk in
36722,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"deed, and he expected to get into trouble for outstaying his leave. He"
36723,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation
36724,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"were still uninjured, for he knew something of Moti Guj's temper, and"
36725,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,reported himself with many lies and salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his
36726,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,pickets for breakfast. The night exercise had made him hungry.
36727,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36728,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Call up your beast,"" said the planter; and Deesa shouted in the"
36729,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,mysterious elephant language that some mahouts believe came from China
36730,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"at the birth of the world, when elephants and not men were masters. Moti"
36731,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Guj heard and came. Elephants do not gallop They move from places at
36732,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,varying rates of speed. If an elephant wished to catch an express train
36733,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"he could not gallop, but he could catch the train. So Moti Guj was at"
36734,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the planter's door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his
36735,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"pickets. He fell into Deesa's arms trumpeting with joy, and the man and"
36736,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"beast wept and slobbered over each other, and handled each other from"
36737,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,head to heel to see that no harm had befallen.
36738,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36739,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"""Now we will get to work,"" said Deesa. ""Lift me up, my son and my joy!"""
36740,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36741,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj swung him up, and the two went to the coffee-clearing to look"
36742,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,for difficult stumps.
36743,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36744,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,The planter was too astonished to be very angry.
36745,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36746,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36747,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
36748,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
