3200,HYMN OF APOLLO,"Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,"
3201,HYMN OF APOLLO,"I walk over the mountains and the waves,"
3202,HYMN OF APOLLO,Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;
3203,HYMN OF APOLLO,My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves

3217,HYMN OF APOLLO,Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;
3218,HYMN OF APOLLO,"Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine,"
3219,HYMN OF APOLLO,"Are portions of one power, which is mine."
3220,HYMN OF APOLLO,
3221,HYMN OF APOLLO,I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven;
3222,HYMN OF APOLLO,Then with unwilling steps I wander down
3223,HYMN OF APOLLO,Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;
3224,HYMN OF APOLLO,For grief that I depart they weep and frown:
3225,HYMN OF APOLLO,What look is more delightful than the smile
3226,HYMN OF APOLLO,With which I soothe them from the western isle?
3227,HYMN OF APOLLO,
3228,HYMN OF APOLLO,I am the eye with which the Universe
3229,HYMN OF APOLLO,"Beholds itself, and knows it is divine;"
3230,HYMN OF APOLLO,"All harmony of instrument or verse,"
3231,HYMN OF APOLLO,"All prophecy, all medicine, is mine,"
3232,HYMN OF APOLLO,All light of art or nature;--to my song
3233,HYMN OF APOLLO,Victory and praise in its own right belong.

3244,PRELUDE,A little while a little space made bright.
3245,PRELUDE,"The night was dark and still the dawn seemed far,"
3246,PRELUDE,"When, o'er the muttering and invisible sea,"
3247,PRELUDE,"Slowly, within the East, there grew a light"
3248,PRELUDE,"Which half was starlight, and half seemed to be"
3249,PRELUDE,The herald of a greater.  The pale white
3250,PRELUDE,"Turned slowly to pale rose, and up the height"
3251,PRELUDE,Of heaven slowly climbed.  The gray sea grew
3252,PRELUDE,Rose-colored like the sky.  A white gull flew
3253,PRELUDE,Straight toward the utmost boundary of the East
3254,PRELUDE,Where slowly the rose gathered and increased.
3255,PRELUDE,"There was light now, where all was black before:"
3256,PRELUDE,It was as on the opening of a door
3257,PRELUDE,By one who in his hand a lamp doth hold
3258,PRELUDE,"(Its flame being hidden by the garment's fold),--"
3259,PRELUDE,"The still air moves, the wide room is less dim."
3260,PRELUDE,"More bright the East became, the ocean turned"
3261,PRELUDE,Dark and more dark against the brightening sky--
3262,PRELUDE,Sharper against the sky the long sea line.
3263,PRELUDE,The hollows of the breakers on the shore
3264,PRELUDE,"Were green like leaves whereon no sun doth shine,"
3265,PRELUDE,Though sunlight make the outer branches hoar.
3266,PRELUDE,From rose to red the level heaven burned;
3267,PRELUDE,"Then sudden, as if a sword fell from on high,"
3268,PRELUDE,A blade of gold flashed on the ocean's rim.

4016,NIGHT,Night is the time for rest;
4017,NIGHT,"How sweet, when labors close,"
4018,NIGHT,To gather round an aching breast
4019,NIGHT,"The curtain of repose,"
4020,NIGHT,"Stretch the tired limbs, and lay the head"

4029,NIGHT,
4030,NIGHT,Night is the time for toil;
4031,NIGHT,"To plough the classic field,"
4032,NIGHT,Intent to find the buried spoil

4034,NIGHT,"Till all is ours that sages taught,"

4051,NIGHT,Night is the time for care;

4055,NIGHT,"Like Brutus, 'midst his slumbering host,"
4056,NIGHT,Summoned to die by Caesar's ghost.
4057,NIGHT,
4058,NIGHT,Night is the time to think;
4059,NIGHT,"When, from the eye, the soul"
4060,NIGHT,"Takes flight; and, on the utmost brink,"
4061,NIGHT,Of yonder starry pole
4062,NIGHT,Descries beyond the abyss of night
4063,NIGHT,The dawn of uncreated light.
4064,NIGHT,
4065,NIGHT,Night is the time to pray;
4066,NIGHT,Our Saviour oft withdrew
4067,NIGHT,To desert mountains far away;
4068,NIGHT,"So will his followers do,--"
4069,NIGHT,"Steal from the throng to haunts untrod,"
4070,NIGHT,And hold communion there with God.

4076,NIGHT,"Think of heaven's bliss, and give the sign"

4875,AN ODE ON THE SPRING,"The insect-youth are on the wing,"

4887,AN ODE ON THE SPRING,"But flutter through life's little day,"
4888,AN ODE ON THE SPRING,In Fortune's varying colors dressed:

4893,AN ODE ON THE SPRING,"Methinks I hear, in accents low,"

4897,AN ODE ON THE SPRING,"Thy joys no glittering female meets,"
4898,AN ODE ON THE SPRING,"No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,"

4914,SPRING,Is with us once again.
4915,SPRING,
4916,SPRING,Out in the lonely woods the jasmine burns
4917,SPRING,"Its fragrant lamps, and turns"
4918,SPRING,Into a royal court with green festoons
4919,SPRING,The banks of dark lagoons.
4920,SPRING,
4921,SPRING,In the deep heart of every forest tree
4922,SPRING,"The blood is all aglee,"
4923,SPRING,And there's a look about the leafless bowers
4924,SPRING,As if they dreamed of flowers.
4925,SPRING,
4926,SPRING,Yet still on every side we trace the hand
4927,SPRING,"Of Winter in the land,"
4928,SPRING,"Save where the maple reddens on the lawn,"
4929,SPRING,Flushed by the season's dawn;
4930,SPRING,
4931,SPRING,"Or where, like those strange semblances we find"
4932,SPRING,"That age to childhood bind,"
4933,SPRING,"The elm puts on, as if in Nature's scorn,"
4934,SPRING,The brown of Autumn corn.
4935,SPRING,
4936,SPRING,"As yet the turf is dark, although you know"
4937,SPRING,"That, not a span below,"
4938,SPRING,"A thousand germs are groping through the gloom,"
4939,SPRING,And soon will burst their tomb.
4940,SPRING,
4941,SPRING,"Already, here and there, on frailest stems"
4942,SPRING,"Appear some azure gems,"
4943,SPRING,"Small as might deck, upon a gala day,"
4944,SPRING,The forehead of a fay.
4945,SPRING,
4946,SPRING,"In gardens you may note amid the dearth,"
4947,SPRING,The crocus breaking earth;
4948,SPRING,"And near the snowdrop's tender white and green,"
4949,SPRING,The violet in its screen.
4950,SPRING,
4951,SPRING,But many gleams and shadows needs must pass
4952,SPRING,"Along the budding grass,"
4953,SPRING,"And weeks go by, before the enamored South"
4954,SPRING,Shall kiss the rose's mouth.
4955,SPRING,
4956,SPRING,Still there's a sense of blossoms yet unborn
4957,SPRING,In the sweet airs of morn;
4958,SPRING,One almost looks to see the very street
4959,SPRING,Grow purple at his feet.
4960,SPRING,
4961,SPRING,"At times a fragrant breeze comes floating by,"
4962,SPRING,"And brings, you know not why,"
4963,SPRING,A feeling as when eager crowds await
4964,SPRING,Before a palace gate
4965,SPRING,
4966,SPRING,"Some wondrous pageant; and you scarce would start,"
4967,SPRING,If from a beech's heart
4968,SPRING,"A blue-eyed Dryad, stepping forth, should say,"
4969,SPRING,"""Behold me! I am May!"""

5015,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,"We sing some old rhyme,"
5016,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,That made the wood ring again
5017,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,In summer time--
5018,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,Sweet summer time!
5019,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,
5020,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,"Then go we to smoking,"

5030,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,So merrily!
5031,THE MEADOWS IN SPRING,

5328,THE PASSING OF MARCH,"Ah, poor starved heart!--for that one rude caress,"
5329,THE PASSING OF MARCH,She cast her violets underneath his feet.

5935,JUNE,"Over his keys the musing organist,"
5936,JUNE,"Beginning doubtfully and far away,"
5937,JUNE,"First lets his fingers wander as they list,"
5938,JUNE,And builds a bridge from Dreamland for his lay:
5939,JUNE,"Then, as the touch of his loved instrument"
5940,JUNE,"Gives hope and fervor, nearer draws his theme,"
5941,JUNE,First guessed by faint auroral flushes sent
5942,JUNE,Along the wavering vista of his dream.
5943,JUNE,
5944,JUNE,Not only around our infancy
5945,JUNE,Doth heaven with all its splendors lie;
5946,JUNE,"Daily, with souls that cringe and plot,"
5947,JUNE,We Sinais climb and know it not.
5948,JUNE,
5949,JUNE,Over our manhood bend the skies;
5950,JUNE,Against our fallen and traitor lives
5951,JUNE,The great winds utter prophecies;
5952,JUNE,With our faint hearts the mountain strives;
5953,JUNE,"Its arms outstretched, the druid wood"
5954,JUNE,Waits with its benedicite;
5955,JUNE,And to our age's drowsy blood
5956,JUNE,Still shouts the inspiring sea.

5959,JUNE,"The beggar is taxed for a corner to die in,"
5960,JUNE,"The priest hath his fee who comes and shrives us,"
5961,JUNE,We bargain for the graves we lie in;
5962,JUNE,"At the devil's booth are all things sold,"
5963,JUNE,Each ounce of dross costs its ounce of gold;
5964,JUNE,"For a cap and bells our lives we pay,"
5965,JUNE,Bubbles we buy with a whole soul's tasking:
5966,JUNE,"'Tis heaven alone that is given away,"
5967,JUNE,'Tis only God may be had for the asking;

5971,JUNE,"Then, if ever, come perfect days;"

5978,JUNE,"And, groping blindly above it for light,"
5979,JUNE,Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;
5980,JUNE,The flush of life may well be seen

5982,JUNE,"The cowslip startles in meadows green,"
5983,JUNE,"The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,"
5984,JUNE,And there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean

5986,JUNE,"The little bird sits at his door in the sun,"
5987,JUNE,"Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,"
5988,JUNE,And lets his illumined being o'errun
5989,JUNE,With the deluge of summer it receives;
5990,JUNE,"His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,"
5991,JUNE,And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings;
5992,JUNE,"He sings to the wide world and she to her nest,--"
5993,JUNE,In the nice ear of Nature which song is the best?
5994,JUNE,
5995,JUNE,"Now is the high-tide of the year,"
5996,JUNE,And whatever of life hath ebbed away
5997,JUNE,"Comes flooding back with a ripply cheer,"
5998,JUNE,Into every bare inlet and creek and bay;
5999,JUNE,"Now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it,"
6000,JUNE,We are happy now because God wills it;
6001,JUNE,"No matter how barren the past may have been,"
6002,JUNE,'Tis enough for us now that the leaves are green;
6003,JUNE,We sit in the warm shade and feel right well
6004,JUNE,How the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell;
6005,JUNE,"We may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing"
6006,JUNE,That skies are clear and grass is growing;
6007,JUNE,"The breeze comes whispering in our ear,"
6008,JUNE,"That dandelions are blossoming near,"
6009,JUNE,"That maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing,"
6010,JUNE,"That the river is bluer than the sky,"
6011,JUNE,That the robin is plastering his house hard by;
6012,JUNE,"And if the breeze kept the good news back,"
6013,JUNE,For other couriers we should not lack;
6014,JUNE,"We could guess it all by yon heifer's lowing,"
6015,JUNE,"And hark! how clear bold chanticleer,"
6016,JUNE,"Warmed with the new wine of the year,"

7023,THE SNOW-SHOWER,On the lake below thy gentle eyes;
7024,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,"
7025,THE SNOW-SHOWER,And dark and silent the water lies;
7026,THE SNOW-SHOWER,And out of that frozen mist the snow
7027,THE SNOW-SHOWER,In wavering flakes begins to flow;
7028,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Flake after flake
7029,THE SNOW-SHOWER,They sink in the dark and silent lake.
7030,THE SNOW-SHOWER,
7031,THE SNOW-SHOWER,See how in a living swarm they come
7032,THE SNOW-SHOWER,From the chambers beyond that misty veil;
7033,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Some hover in air awhile, and some"
7034,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.
7035,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"All, dropping swiftly, or settling slow,"
7036,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Meet, and are still in the depths below;"
7037,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Flake after flake
7038,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.
7039,THE SNOW-SHOWER,
7040,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud,"

7043,THE SNOW-SHOWER,That whiten by night the Milky Way;
7044,THE SNOW-SHOWER,There broader and burlier masses fall;
7045,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"The sullen water buries them all,--"
7046,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Flake after flake,--"
7047,THE SNOW-SHOWER,All drowned in the dark and silent lake.
7048,THE SNOW-SHOWER,
7049,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"And some, as on tender wings they glide"
7050,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"From their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray,"
7051,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Are joined in their fall, and, side by side,"
7052,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Come clinging along their unsteady way;
7053,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"As friend with friend, or husband with wife,"
7054,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Makes hand in hand the passage of life;
7055,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Each mated flake
7056,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.
7057,THE SNOW-SHOWER,
7058,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste"

7061,THE SNOW-SHOWER,They fling themselves from their shadowy height.
7062,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"The fair, frail creatures of middle sky,"
7063,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"What speed they make, with their grave so nigh;"
7064,THE SNOW-SHOWER,Flake after flake
7065,THE SNOW-SHOWER,To lie in the dark and silent lake.
7066,THE SNOW-SHOWER,
7067,THE SNOW-SHOWER,I see in thy gentle eyes a tear;
7068,THE SNOW-SHOWER,They turn to me in sorrowful thought;
7069,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,"
7070,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Who were for a time, and now are not;"
7071,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Like these fair children of cloud and frost,"
7072,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"That glisten a moment and then are lost,--"
7073,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Flake after flake,--"
7074,THE SNOW-SHOWER,All lost in the dark and silent lake.
7075,THE SNOW-SHOWER,
7076,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Yet look again, for the clouds divide;"
7077,THE SNOW-SHOWER,A gleam of blue on the water lies;
7078,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"And far away, on the mountain-side,"
7079,THE SNOW-SHOWER,A sunbeam falls from the opening skies;
7080,THE SNOW-SHOWER,But the hurrying host that flew between
7081,THE SNOW-SHOWER,The cloud and the water no more is seen;
7082,THE SNOW-SHOWER,"Flake after flake,"
7083,THE SNOW-SHOWER,At rest in the dark and silent lake.

7094,MIDWINTER,"Athwart the hill-top, rapt and pale,"
7095,MIDWINTER,Silently drops a silvery veil;
7096,MIDWINTER,And all the valley is shut in
7097,MIDWINTER,By flickering curtains gray and thin.
7098,MIDWINTER,
7099,MIDWINTER,But cheerily the chickadee
7100,MIDWINTER,Singeth to me on fence and tree;
7101,MIDWINTER,"The snow sails round him as he sings,"
7102,MIDWINTER,White as the down of angels' wings.
7103,MIDWINTER,
7104,MIDWINTER,I watch the slow flakes as they fall
7105,MIDWINTER,On bank and brier and broken wall;
7106,MIDWINTER,"Over the orchard, waste and brown,"
7107,MIDWINTER,"All noiselessly they settle down,"
7108,MIDWINTER,"Tipping the apple-boughs, and each"
7109,MIDWINTER,Light quivering twig of plum and peach.
7110,MIDWINTER,
7111,MIDWINTER,On turf and curb and bower-roof
7112,MIDWINTER,The snow-storm spreads its ivory woof;
7113,MIDWINTER,It paves with pearl the garden-walk;
7114,MIDWINTER,And lovingly round tattered stalk
7115,MIDWINTER,And shivering stem its magic weaves
7116,MIDWINTER,A mantle fair as lily-leaves.
7117,MIDWINTER,
7118,MIDWINTER,"The hooded beehive, small and low,"
7119,MIDWINTER,Stands like a maiden in the snow;
7120,MIDWINTER,And the old door-slab is half hid
7121,MIDWINTER,Under an alabaster lid.
7122,MIDWINTER,All day it snows: the sheeted post
7123,MIDWINTER,Gleams in the dimness like a ghost;
7124,MIDWINTER,All day the blasted oak has stood
7125,MIDWINTER,A muffled wizard of the wood;
7126,MIDWINTER,Garland and airy cap adorn
7127,MIDWINTER,"The sumach and the wayside thorn,"
7128,MIDWINTER,And clustering spangles lodge and shine
7129,MIDWINTER,In the dark tresses of the pine.
7130,MIDWINTER,
7131,MIDWINTER,"The ragged bramble, dwarfed and old,"
7132,MIDWINTER,Shrinks like a beggar in the cold;
7133,MIDWINTER,"In surplice white the cedar stands,"
7134,MIDWINTER,And blesses him with priestly hands.
7135,MIDWINTER,
7136,MIDWINTER,Still cheerily the chickadee
7137,MIDWINTER,Singeth to me on fence and tree:
7138,MIDWINTER,But in my inmost ear is heard
7139,MIDWINTER,The music of a holier bird;
7140,MIDWINTER,"And heavenly thoughts, as soft and white"
7141,MIDWINTER,"As snow-flakes, on my soul alight,"
7142,MIDWINTER,"Clothing with love my lonely heart,"
7143,MIDWINTER,"Healing with peace each bruised part,"
7144,MIDWINTER,Till all my being seems to be
7145,MIDWINTER,Transfigured by their purity.

8134,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8135,THE BROOK'S SONG,"By thirty hills I hurry down,"
8136,THE BROOK'S SONG,"Or slip between the ridges,"
8137,THE BROOK'S SONG,"By twenty thorps, a little town,"
8138,THE BROOK'S SONG,And half a hundred bridges.
8139,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8140,THE BROOK'S SONG,Till last by Philip's farm I flow
8141,THE BROOK'S SONG,"To join the brimming river,"
8142,THE BROOK'S SONG,"For men may come and men may go,"
8143,THE BROOK'S SONG,But I go on for ever.
8144,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8145,THE BROOK'S SONG,"I chatter over stony ways,"
8146,THE BROOK'S SONG,"In little sharps and trebles,"
8147,THE BROOK'S SONG,"I bubble into eddying bays,"
8148,THE BROOK'S SONG,I babble on the pebbles.
8149,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8150,THE BROOK'S SONG,With many a curve my banks I fret
8151,THE BROOK'S SONG,"By many a field and fallow,"
8152,THE BROOK'S SONG,And many a fairy foreland set
8153,THE BROOK'S SONG,With willow-weed and mallow.
8154,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8155,THE BROOK'S SONG,"I chatter, chatter, as I flow"
8156,THE BROOK'S SONG,"To join the brimming river,"
8157,THE BROOK'S SONG,"For men may come and men may go,"
8158,THE BROOK'S SONG,But I go on for ever.
8159,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8160,THE BROOK'S SONG,"I wind about, and in and out,"
8161,THE BROOK'S SONG,"With here a blossom sailing,"
8162,THE BROOK'S SONG,"And here and there a lusty trout,"
8163,THE BROOK'S SONG,"And here and there a grayling,"
8164,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8165,THE BROOK'S SONG,And here and there a foamy flake
8166,THE BROOK'S SONG,"Upon me, as I travel"
8167,THE BROOK'S SONG,With many a silvery water-break
8168,THE BROOK'S SONG,"Above the golden gravel,"
8169,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8170,THE BROOK'S SONG,"And draw them all along, and flow"
8171,THE BROOK'S SONG,"To join the brimming river,"

8174,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8175,THE BROOK'S SONG,"I steal by lawns and grassy plots,"
8176,THE BROOK'S SONG,I slide by hazel covers;
8177,THE BROOK'S SONG,I move the sweet forget-me-nots
8178,THE BROOK'S SONG,That grow for happy lovers.
8179,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8180,THE BROOK'S SONG,"I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,"
8181,THE BROOK'S SONG,Among my skimming swallows;
8182,THE BROOK'S SONG,I make the netted sunbeam dance
8183,THE BROOK'S SONG,Against my sandy shallows.
8184,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8185,THE BROOK'S SONG,I murmur under moon and stars
8186,THE BROOK'S SONG,In brambly wildernesses;
8187,THE BROOK'S SONG,I linger by my shingly bars;
8188,THE BROOK'S SONG,I loiter round my cresses;
8189,THE BROOK'S SONG,
8190,THE BROOK'S SONG,And out again I curve and flow
8191,THE BROOK'S SONG,"To join the brimming river,"
8192,THE BROOK'S SONG,"For men may come and men may go,"

8202,ARETHUSA,Arethusa arose
8203,ARETHUSA,From her couch of snows
8204,ARETHUSA,"In the Acroceraunian mountains,--"
8205,ARETHUSA,"From cloud and from crag,"
8206,ARETHUSA,"With many a jag,"
8207,ARETHUSA,Shepherding her bright fountains.
8208,ARETHUSA,She leapt down the rocks
8209,ARETHUSA,With her rainbow locks
8210,ARETHUSA,Streaming among the streams;
8211,ARETHUSA,Her steps paved with green
8212,ARETHUSA,The downward ravine
8213,ARETHUSA,Which slopes to the western gleams:
8214,ARETHUSA,"And gliding and springing,"
8215,ARETHUSA,"She went, ever singing,"
8216,ARETHUSA,In murmurs as soft as sleep;
8217,ARETHUSA,"The Earth seemed to love her,"
8218,ARETHUSA,"And Heaven smiled above her,"
8219,ARETHUSA,As she lingered towards the deep.
8220,ARETHUSA,
8221,ARETHUSA,"Then Alpheus bold,"
8222,ARETHUSA,"On his glacier cold,"
8223,ARETHUSA,"With his trident the mountains strook,"
8224,ARETHUSA,And opened a chasm
8225,ARETHUSA,In the rocks;--with the spasm
8226,ARETHUSA,All Erymanthus shook.
8227,ARETHUSA,And the black south wind
8228,ARETHUSA,It unsealed behind
8229,ARETHUSA,"The urns of the silent snow,"
8230,ARETHUSA,And earthquake and thunder
8231,ARETHUSA,Did rend in sunder
8232,ARETHUSA,The bars of the springs below:
8233,ARETHUSA,And the beard and the hair
8234,ARETHUSA,Of the River-god were
8235,ARETHUSA,"Seen through the torrent's sweep,"
8236,ARETHUSA,As he followed the light
8237,ARETHUSA,Of the fleet nymph's flight
8238,ARETHUSA,To the brink of the Dorian deep.
8239,ARETHUSA,
8240,ARETHUSA,"""Oh, save me!  Oh, guide me!"
8241,ARETHUSA,And bid the deep hide me!
8242,ARETHUSA,"For he grasps me now by the hair!"""
8243,ARETHUSA,"The loud Ocean heard,"
8244,ARETHUSA,"To its blue depth stirred,"
8245,ARETHUSA,And divided at her prayer;
8246,ARETHUSA,And under the water
8247,ARETHUSA,The Earth's white daughter
8248,ARETHUSA,Fled like a sunny beam;
8249,ARETHUSA,"Behind her descended,"
8250,ARETHUSA,"Her billows, unblended"
8251,ARETHUSA,With the brackish Dorian stream.
8252,ARETHUSA,Like a gloomy stain
8253,ARETHUSA,"On the emerald main,"
8254,ARETHUSA,"Alpheus rushed behind,--"
8255,ARETHUSA,As an eagle pursuing
8256,ARETHUSA,A dove to its ruin
8257,ARETHUSA,Down the streams of the cloudy wind.
8258,ARETHUSA,
8259,ARETHUSA,Under the bowers
8260,ARETHUSA,Where the Ocean Powers
8261,ARETHUSA,Sit on their pearled thrones;
8262,ARETHUSA,Through the coral woods
8263,ARETHUSA,"Of the weltering floods,"
8264,ARETHUSA,Over heaps of unvalued stones;
8265,ARETHUSA,Through the dim beams
8266,ARETHUSA,Which amid the streams
8267,ARETHUSA,Weave a network of colored light;
8268,ARETHUSA,And under the caves
8269,ARETHUSA,Where the shadowy waves
8270,ARETHUSA,Are as green as the forest's night:--
8271,ARETHUSA,"Outspeeding the shark,"
8272,ARETHUSA,"And the swordfish dark,--"
8273,ARETHUSA,"Under the Ocean's foam,"
8274,ARETHUSA,And up through the rifts
8275,ARETHUSA,"Of the mountain clifts,"
8276,ARETHUSA,They passed to their Dorian home.
8277,ARETHUSA,
8278,ARETHUSA,And now from their fountains
8279,ARETHUSA,"In Enna's mountains,"
8280,ARETHUSA,"Down one vale where the morning basks,"
8281,ARETHUSA,Like friends once parted
8282,ARETHUSA,"Grown single-hearted,"
8283,ARETHUSA,They ply their watery tasks.
8284,ARETHUSA,At sunrise they leap
8285,ARETHUSA,From their cradles steep
8286,ARETHUSA,In the cave of the shelving hill;
8287,ARETHUSA,At noontide they flow
8288,ARETHUSA,Through the woods below
8289,ARETHUSA,And the meadows of asphodel;
8290,ARETHUSA,And at night they sleep
8291,ARETHUSA,In the rocking deep
8292,ARETHUSA,Beneath the Ortygian shore;--
8293,ARETHUSA,Like spirits that lie
8294,ARETHUSA,In the azure sky.
8295,ARETHUSA,When they love but live no more.

8306,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,My little boy asked me
8307,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Thus, once on a time;"
8308,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,And moreover he tasked me
8309,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,To tell him in rhyme.
8310,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Anon, at the word,"
8311,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"There first came one daughter,"
8312,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"And then came another,"
8313,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,To second and third
8314,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"The request of their brother,"
8315,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,And to hear how the water
8316,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Comes down at Lodore,"
8317,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"With its rush and its roar,"
8318,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,As many a time
8319,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,They had seen it before.
8320,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"So I told them in rhyme,"
8321,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,For of rhymes I had store;
8322,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,And 'twas in my vocation
8323,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,For their recreation
8324,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,That so I should sing;
8325,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,Because I was Laureate
8326,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,To them and the King.
8327,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,
8328,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,From its sources which well
8329,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,In the tarn on the fell;
8330,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,From its fountains
8331,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"In the mountains,"
8332,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,Its rills and its gills;
8333,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Through moss and through brake,"
8334,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,It runs and it creeps
8335,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"For a while, till it sleeps"
8336,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,In its own little lake.
8337,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"And thence at departing,"
8338,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Awakening and starting,"
8339,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"It runs through the reeds,"
8340,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"And away it proceeds,"
8341,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Through meadow and glade,"
8342,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"In sun and in shade,"
8343,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"And through the wood-shelter,"
8344,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Among crags in its flurry,"
8345,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Helter-skelter,"
8346,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,Hurry-skurry.
8347,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Here it comes sparkling,"
8348,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,And there it lies darkling;
8349,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,Now smoking and frothing
8350,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Its tumult and wrath in,"
8351,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Till, in this rapid race"
8352,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"On which it is bent,"
8353,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,It reaches the place
8354,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,Of its steep descent.
8355,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,
8356,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,The cataract strong
8357,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,"Then plunges along,"

8360,THE CATARACT OF LODORE,Its caverns and rocks among;

8566,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8567,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven"
8568,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,With intricate shades of the vines that myriad-cloven
8569,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs,--"
8570,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Emerald twilights,--"
8571,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Virginal shy lights,"
8572,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Wrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows,"
8573,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,When lovers pace timidly down through the green colonnades
8574,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Of the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods,"
8575,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Of the heavenly woods and glades,"
8576,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,That run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within
8577,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,The wide sea-marshes of Glynn;--
8578,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Beautiful glooms, soft dusks in the noonday fire,--"
8579,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Wildwood privacies, closets of lone desire,"
8580,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves,--"
8581,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves,"
8582,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Pure with a sense of the passing of saints through the wood,"
8583,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Cool for the dutiful weighing of ill with good;--
8584,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8585,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"O braided dusks of the oak and woven shades of the vine,"
8586,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,While the riotous noonday sun of the June-day long did shine
8587,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Ye held me fast in your heart and I held you fast in mine;
8588,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"But now when the noon is no more, and riot is rest,"
8589,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"And the sun is a-wait at the ponderous gate of the West,"
8590,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And the slant yellow beam down the wood-aisle doth seem
8591,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Like a lane into heaven that leads from a dream,--"
8592,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Ay, now, when my soul all day hath drunken the soul of the oak,"
8593,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"And my heart is at ease from men, and the wearisome sound of the stroke"
8594,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low,"
8595,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"And belief overmasters doubt, and I know that I know,"
8596,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"And my spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within,"
8597,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,That the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn
8598,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Will work me no fear like the fear they have wrought me of yore
8599,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"When length was fatigue, and when breadth was but bitterness sore,"
8600,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain
8601,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain,--"
8602,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8603,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Oh, now, unafraid, I am fain to face"
8604,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,The vast sweet visage of space.
8605,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"To the edge of the wood I am drawn, I am drawn,"
8606,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Where the gray beach glimmering runs, as a belt of the dawn,"
8607,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,For a mete and a mark
8608,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,To the forest-dark:--
8609,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,So:
8610,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Affable live-oak, leaning low,--"
8611,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Thus--with your favor--soft, with a reverent hand,"
8612,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"(Not lightly touching your person, Lord of the land!)"
8613,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Bending your beauty aside, with a step I stand"
8614,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"On the firm-packed sand,"
8615,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Free
8616,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea.
8617,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band
8618,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Of the sand-beach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds
8619,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,of the land.
8620,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines
8621,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,linger and curl
8622,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,As a silver wrought garment that clings to and follows the firm sweet
8623,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,limbs of a girl.
8624,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Vanishing, swerving, evermore curving again into sight,"
8625,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Softly the sand-beach wavers away to a dim gray looping of light.
8626,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And what if behind me to westward the wall of the woods stands high?
8627,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"The world lies east: how ample, the marsh and the sea and the sky!"
8628,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"A league and a league of marsh-grass, waist-high, broad in the blade,"
8629,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Green, and all of a height, and unflecked with a light or a shade,"
8630,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Stretch leisurely off, in a pleasant plain,"
8631,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,To the terminal blue of the main.
8632,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8633,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea?"
8634,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Somehow my soul seems suddenly free
8635,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,"
8636,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn.
8637,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8638,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Ye marshes, how candid and simple and nothing-withholding and free"
8639,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea!
8640,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Tolerant plains, that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun,"
8641,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Ye spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won
8642,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain
8643,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain.
8644,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8645,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"As the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod,"
8646,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God:
8647,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies
8648,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,In the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt the marsh and the skies:
8649,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod
8650,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God:
8651,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Oh, like to the greatness of God is the greatness within"
8652,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn."
8653,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8654,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"And the sea lends large, as the marsh: lo, out of his plenty the sea"
8655,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Pours fast: full soon the time of the flood-tide must be:
8656,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Look how the grace of the sea doth go
8657,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,About and about through the intricate channels that flow
8658,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Here and there,"
8659,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Everywhere,"
8660,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Till his waters have flooded the uttermost creeks and the low-lying lanes,"
8661,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"And the marsh is meshed with a million veins,"
8662,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,That like as with rosy and silvery essences flow
8663,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,In the rose-and-silver evening glow.
8664,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Farewell, my lord Sun!"
8665,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,The creeks overflow: a thousand rivulets run
8666,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,'Twixt the roots of the sod; the blades of the marsh-grass stir;
8667,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Passeth a hurrying sound of wings that westward whirr;
8668,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Passeth, and all is still; and the currents cease to run;"
8669,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And the sea and the marsh are one.
8670,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8671,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,How still the plains of the waters be!
8672,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,The tide is in his ecstasy;
8673,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,The tide is at his highest height:
8674,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And it is night.
8675,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,
8676,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And now from the Vast of the Lord will the waters of sleep
8677,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,"Roll in on the souls of men,"
8678,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,But who will reveal to our waking ken
8679,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,The forms that swim and the shapes that creep
8680,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,Under the waters of sleep?
8681,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,And I would I could know what swimmeth below when the tide comes in
8682,THE MARSHES OF GLYNN,On the length and the breadth of the marvelous marshes of Glynn.

9409,THE GARDEN,How vainly men themselves amaze
9410,THE GARDEN,"To win the palm, the oak, or bays,"
9411,THE GARDEN,And their incessant labors see
9412,THE GARDEN,"Crowned from some single herb or tree,"
9413,THE GARDEN,Whose short and narrow-verged shade
9414,THE GARDEN,Does prudently their toils upbraid;
9415,THE GARDEN,While all the flowers and trees do close
9416,THE GARDEN,To weave the garlands of repose!
9417,THE GARDEN,
9418,THE GARDEN,"Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,"
9419,THE GARDEN,"And Innocence, thy sister dear?"
9420,THE GARDEN,"Mistaken long, I sought you then"
9421,THE GARDEN,In busy companies of men:
9422,THE GARDEN,"Your sacred plants, if here below,"
9423,THE GARDEN,Only among the plants will grow;
9424,THE GARDEN,Society is all but rude
9425,THE GARDEN,To this delicious solitude.
9426,THE GARDEN,
9427,THE GARDEN,No white nor red was ever seen
9428,THE GARDEN,So amorous as this lovely green.
9429,THE GARDEN,"Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,"
9430,THE GARDEN,Cut in these trees their mistress' name:
9431,THE GARDEN,"Little, alas! they know or heed"
9432,THE GARDEN,How far these beauties hers exceed!
9433,THE GARDEN,"Fair trees! where'er your barks I wound,"
9434,THE GARDEN,No name shall but your own he found.
9435,THE GARDEN,
9436,THE GARDEN,"When we have run our passions' heat,"
9437,THE GARDEN,Love hither makes his best retreat:
9438,THE GARDEN,"The gods, that mortal beauty chase,"
9439,THE GARDEN,Still in a tree did end their race;
9440,THE GARDEN,Apollo hunted Daphne so
9441,THE GARDEN,Only that she might laurel grow;
9442,THE GARDEN,"And Pan did after Syrinx speed,"
9443,THE GARDEN,"Not as a nymph, but for a reed."
9444,THE GARDEN,
9445,THE GARDEN,What wondrous life is this I lead!
9446,THE GARDEN,Ripe apples drop about my head;
9447,THE GARDEN,The luscious clusters of the vine
9448,THE GARDEN,Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
9449,THE GARDEN,The nectarine and curious peach
9450,THE GARDEN,Into my hands themselves do reach;
9451,THE GARDEN,"Stumbling on melons, as I pass,"
9452,THE GARDEN,"Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass."
9453,THE GARDEN,
9454,THE GARDEN,"Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,"
9455,THE GARDEN,Withdraws into its happiness;
9456,THE GARDEN,"The mind, that ocean where each kind"
9457,THE GARDEN,Does straight its own resemblance find;
9458,THE GARDEN,"Yet it creates, transcending these,"
9459,THE GARDEN,"Far other worlds, and other seas;"
9460,THE GARDEN,Annihilating all that's made
9461,THE GARDEN,To a green thought in a green shade.
9462,THE GARDEN,
9463,THE GARDEN,"Here at the fountain's sliding foot,"
9464,THE GARDEN,"Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root,"
9465,THE GARDEN,"Casting the body's vest aside,"
9466,THE GARDEN,My soul into the boughs does glide;
9467,THE GARDEN,"There, like a bird, it sits and sings,"
9468,THE GARDEN,"Then whets and combs its silver wings,"
9469,THE GARDEN,"And, till prepared for longer flight,"
9470,THE GARDEN,Waves in its plumes the various light.
9471,THE GARDEN,
9472,THE GARDEN,Such was that happy Garden-state
9473,THE GARDEN,While man there walked without a mate:
9474,THE GARDEN,"After a place so pure and sweet,"
9475,THE GARDEN,What other help could yet be meet!
9476,THE GARDEN,But 'twas beyond a mortal's share
9477,THE GARDEN,To wander solitary there:
9478,THE GARDEN,"Two paradises 'twere in one,"
9479,THE GARDEN,To live in Paradise alone.
9480,THE GARDEN,
9481,THE GARDEN,How well the skilful gardener drew
9482,THE GARDEN,Of flowers and herbs this dial new!
9483,THE GARDEN,"Where, from above, the milder sun"
9484,THE GARDEN,Does through a fragrant zodiac run:
9485,THE GARDEN,"And, as it works, the industrious bee"
9486,THE GARDEN,Computes its time as well as we.
9487,THE GARDEN,How could such sweet and wholesome hours
9488,THE GARDEN,"Be reckoned, but with herbs and flowers"

9809,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"I mind me in the days departed,"
9810,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"How often underneath the sun,"
9811,THE DESERTED GARDEN,With childish bounds I used to run
9812,THE DESERTED GARDEN,To a garden long deserted.
9813,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9814,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The beds and walks were vanished quite;
9815,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"And wheresoe'er had struck the spade,"
9816,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The greenest grasses Nature laid
9817,THE DESERTED GARDEN,To sanctify her right.
9818,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9819,THE DESERTED GARDEN,I called the place my wilderness;
9820,THE DESERTED GARDEN,For no one entered there but I;
9821,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"The sheep looked in, the grass to espy,"
9822,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And passed it ne'ertheless.
9823,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9824,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"The trees were interwoven wild,"
9825,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And spread their boughs enough about
9826,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"To keep both sheep and shepherd out,"
9827,THE DESERTED GARDEN,But not a happy child.
9828,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9829,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Adventurous joy it was for me!
9830,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"I crept beneath the boughs, and found"
9831,THE DESERTED GARDEN,A circle smooth of mossy ground
9832,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Beneath a poplar tree.
9833,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9834,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Old garden rose-trees hedged it in,"
9835,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Bedropt with roses waxen-white,"
9836,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Well satisfied with dew and light
9837,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And careless to be seen.
9838,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9839,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Long years ago, it might befall,"
9840,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"When all the garden flowers were trim,"
9841,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The grave old gardener prided him
9842,THE DESERTED GARDEN,On these the most of all.
9843,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9844,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Some lady, stately overmuch,"
9845,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Here moving with a silken noise,"
9846,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Has blushed beside them at the voice
9847,THE DESERTED GARDEN,That likened her to such.
9848,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9849,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Or these, to make a diadem,"
9850,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"She often may have plucked and twined,"
9851,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Half-smiling as it came to mind,"
9852,THE DESERTED GARDEN,That few would look at them.
9853,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9854,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Oh, little thought that lady proud,"
9855,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"A child would watch her fair white rose,"
9856,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"When buried lay her whiter brows,"
9857,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And silk was changed for shroud!
9858,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9859,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Nor thought that gardener, (full of scorns"
9860,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"For men unlearned and simple phrase,)"
9861,THE DESERTED GARDEN,A child would bring it all its praise
9862,THE DESERTED GARDEN,By creeping through the thorns!
9863,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9864,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"To me upon my low moss seat,"
9865,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Though never a dream the roses sent,"
9866,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Of science or love's compliment,"
9867,THE DESERTED GARDEN,I ween they smelt as sweet.
9868,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9869,THE DESERTED GARDEN,It did not move my grief to see
9870,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The trace of human step departed:
9871,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Because the garden was deserted,"
9872,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The blither place for me!
9873,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9874,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken"
9875,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Hath childhood 'twixt the sun and sward;
9876,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"We draw the moral afterward,"
9877,THE DESERTED GARDEN,We feel the gladness then.
9878,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9879,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And gladdest hours for me did glide
9880,THE DESERTED GARDEN,In silence at the rose-tree wall:
9881,THE DESERTED GARDEN,A thrush made gladness musical
9882,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Upon the other side.
9883,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9884,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Nor he nor I did e'er incline
9885,THE DESERTED GARDEN,To peck or pluck the blossoms white;
9886,THE DESERTED GARDEN,How should I know but roses might
9887,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Lead lives as glad as mine?
9888,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9889,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"To make my hermit-home complete,"
9890,THE DESERTED GARDEN,I brought clear water from the spring
9891,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Praised in its own low murmuring,"
9892,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And cresses glossy wet.
9893,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9894,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"And so, I thought, my likeness grew"
9895,THE DESERTED GARDEN,(Without the melancholy tale)
9896,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"To ""gentle hermit of the dale,"""
9897,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And Angelina too.
9898,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9899,THE DESERTED GARDEN,For oft I read within my nook
9900,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
9901,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Made sounds poetic in the trees,"
9902,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And then I shut the book.
9903,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9904,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"If I shut this wherein I write,"
9905,THE DESERTED GARDEN,I hear no more the wind athwart
9906,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Those trees, nor feel that childish heart"
9907,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Delighting in delight.
9908,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9909,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"My childhood from my life is parted,"
9910,THE DESERTED GARDEN,My footstep from the moss which drew
9911,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Its fairy circle round: anew
9912,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The garden is deserted.
9913,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9914,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Another thrush may there rehearse
9915,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The madrigals which sweetest are;
9916,THE DESERTED GARDEN,No more for me! myself afar
9917,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Do sing a sadder verse.
9918,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9919,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Ah me, ah me! when erst I lay"
9920,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"In that child's-nest so greenly wrought,"
9921,THE DESERTED GARDEN,I laughed unto myself and thought
9922,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"""The time will pass away."""
9923,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9924,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"And still I laughed, and did not fear"
9925,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"But that, whene'er was passed away"
9926,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"The childish time, some happier play"
9927,THE DESERTED GARDEN,My womanhood would cheer.
9928,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9929,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"I knew the time would pass away,"
9930,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"And yet, beside the rose-tree wall,"
9931,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"Dear God, how seldom, if at all,"
9932,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Did I look up to pray!
9933,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9934,THE DESERTED GARDEN,The time is past; and now that grows
9935,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"The cypress high among the trees,"
9936,THE DESERTED GARDEN,And I behold white sepulchres
9937,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"As well as the white rose,--"
9938,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9939,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"When graver, meeker thoughts are given,"
9940,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"And I have learnt to lift my face,"
9941,THE DESERTED GARDEN,Reminded how earth's greenest place
9942,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"The color draws from heaven,--"
9943,THE DESERTED GARDEN,
9944,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"It something saith for earthly pain,"
9945,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"But more for Heavenly promise free,"
9946,THE DESERTED GARDEN,"That I who was, would shrink to be"

9958,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Walled round with rocks as an inland island,"
9959,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.
9960,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses
9961,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The steep square slope of the blossomless bed
9962,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses
9963,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Now lie dead.
9964,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
9965,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,"
9966,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,To the low last edge of the long lone land.

9975,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,That crawls by a track none turn to climb
9976,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,To the strait waste place that the years have rifled
9977,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Of all but the thorns that are touched not of Time.
9978,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;
9979,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.
9980,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,"
9981,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,These remain.
9982,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
9983,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;
9984,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;
9985,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,"
9986,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Could she call, there were never a rose to reply."
9987,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Over the meadows that blossom and wither
9988,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;
9989,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Only the sun and the rain come hither
9990,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,All year long.
9991,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
9992,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels
9993,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.
9994,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Only the wind here hovers and revels
9995,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,In a round where life seems barren as death.
9996,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,"
9997,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Haply, of lovers none ever will know,"

9999,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Years ago.
10000,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
10001,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Heart handfast in heart as they stood, ""Look thither,"""

10005,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,"
10006,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,"
10007,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,"
10008,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Love was dead.
10009,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
10010,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?"
10011,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,And were one to the end--but what end who knows?
10012,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,"

10014,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?
10015,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,What love was ever as deep as a grave?
10016,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,They are loveless now as the grass above them
10017,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Or the wave.
10018,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,

10020,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.
10021,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not a breath of the time that has been hovers
10022,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,In the air now soft with a summer to be.
10023,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter
10024,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,"
10025,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"When, as they that are free now of weeping and laughter,"
10026,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,We shall sleep.

10988,TO THE DANDELION,"Beside the door, sang clearly all day long,"
10989,TO THE DANDELION,"And I, secure in childish piety,"
10990,TO THE DANDELION,Listened as if I heard an angel sing
10991,TO THE DANDELION,"With news from heaven, which he could bring"
10992,TO THE DANDELION,Fresh every day to my untainted ears
10993,TO THE DANDELION,When birds and flowers and I were happy peers.

12876,THE BLACKBIRD,"Curse good and great, but worship their own wit."
12877,THE BLACKBIRD,"And roar of fights, and fairs, and junketings,"
12878,THE BLACKBIRD,"Corn, colts, and curs--the while the Blackbird sings."
12879,THE BLACKBIRD,
12880,THE BLACKBIRD,"Before her home, in her accustomed seat,"
12881,THE BLACKBIRD,The tidy Grandam spins beneath the shade
12882,THE BLACKBIRD,"Of the old honeysuckle, at her feet"
12883,THE BLACKBIRD,"The dreaming pug, and purring tabby laid;"
12884,THE BLACKBIRD,"To her low chair a little maiden clings,"
12885,THE BLACKBIRD,And spells in silence--while the Blackbird sings.
12886,THE BLACKBIRD,
12887,THE BLACKBIRD,Sometimes the shadow of a lazy cloud
12888,THE BLACKBIRD,Breathes o'er the hamlet with its gardens green.
12889,THE BLACKBIRD,While the far fields with sunlight overflowed
12890,THE BLACKBIRD,Like golden shores of Fairyland are seen;
12891,THE BLACKBIRD,"Again, the sunshine on the shadow springs,"
12892,THE BLACKBIRD,And fires the thicket where the Blackbird sings.
12893,THE BLACKBIRD,
12894,THE BLACKBIRD,"The woods, the lawn, the peaked Manorhouse,"
12895,THE BLACKBIRD,"With its peach-covered walls, and rookery loud,"
12896,THE BLACKBIRD,"The trim, quaint garden alleys, screened with boughs."
12897,THE BLACKBIRD,"The lion-headed gates, so grim and proud,"
12898,THE BLACKBIRD,"The mossy fountain with its murmurings,"
12899,THE BLACKBIRD,Lie in warm sunshine--while the Blackbird sings.
12900,THE BLACKBIRD,
12901,THE BLACKBIRD,"The ring of silver voices, and the sheen"
12902,THE BLACKBIRD,Of festal garments--and my Lady streams
12903,THE BLACKBIRD,With her gay court across the garden green;
12904,THE BLACKBIRD,"Some laugh, and dance, some whisper their love-dreams;"
12905,THE BLACKBIRD,And one calls for a little page; he strings
12906,THE BLACKBIRD,Her lute beside her--while the Blackbird sings.
12907,THE BLACKBIRD,
12908,THE BLACKBIRD,"A little while--and lo! the charm is heard,"
12909,THE BLACKBIRD,"A youth, whose life has been all Summer, steals"
12910,THE BLACKBIRD,"Forth from the noisy guests around the board,"
12911,THE BLACKBIRD,Creeps by her softly; at her footstool kneels;
12912,THE BLACKBIRD,"And, when she pauses, murmurs tender things"
12913,THE BLACKBIRD,Into her fond ear--while the Blackbird sings.
12914,THE BLACKBIRD,
12915,THE BLACKBIRD,"The smoke-wreaths from the chimneys curl up higher,"
12916,THE BLACKBIRD,And dizzy things of eve begin to float
12917,THE BLACKBIRD,Upon the light; the breeze begins to tire;
12918,THE BLACKBIRD,Half way to sunset with a drowsy note
12919,THE BLACKBIRD,The ancient clock from out the valley swings;
12920,THE BLACKBIRD,The Grandam nods--and still the Blackbird sings.
12921,THE BLACKBIRD,
12922,THE BLACKBIRD,"Far shouts and laughter from the farmstead peal,"
12923,THE BLACKBIRD,Where the great stack is piling in the sun;
12924,THE BLACKBIRD,"Through narrow gates o'erladen wagons reel,"
12925,THE BLACKBIRD,And barking curs into the tumult run;
12926,THE BLACKBIRD,"While the inconstant wind bears off, and brings"
12927,THE BLACKBIRD,The merry tempest--and the Blackbird sings.
12928,THE BLACKBIRD,
12929,THE BLACKBIRD,On the high wold the last look of the sun
12930,THE BLACKBIRD,"Burns, like a beacon, over dale and stream;"
12931,THE BLACKBIRD,"The shouts have ceased, the laughter and the fun;"
12932,THE BLACKBIRD,"The Grandam sleeps, and peaceful be her dream;"
12933,THE BLACKBIRD,Only a hammer on an anvil rings;
12934,THE BLACKBIRD,The day is dying--still the Blackbird sings.
12935,THE BLACKBIRD,
12936,THE BLACKBIRD,Now the good Vicar passes from his gate
12937,THE BLACKBIRD,"Serene, with long white hair; and in his eye"
12938,THE BLACKBIRD,"Burns the clear spirit that hath conquered Fate,"
12939,THE BLACKBIRD,And felt the wings of immortality;
12940,THE BLACKBIRD,"His heart is thronged with great imaginings,"
12941,THE BLACKBIRD,And tender mercies--while the Blackbird sings.
12942,THE BLACKBIRD,
12943,THE BLACKBIRD,"Down by the brook he bends his steps, and through"
12944,THE BLACKBIRD,A lowly wicket; and at last he stands
12945,THE BLACKBIRD,Awful beside the bed of one who grew
12946,THE BLACKBIRD,"From boyhood with him--who, with lifted hands"
12947,THE BLACKBIRD,"And eyes, seems listening to far welcomings,"
12948,THE BLACKBIRD,And sweeter music than the Blackbird sings.
12949,THE BLACKBIRD,
12950,THE BLACKBIRD,"Two golden stars, like tokens from the Blest,"
12951,THE BLACKBIRD,Strike on his dim orbs from the setting sun;
12952,THE BLACKBIRD,His sinking hands seem pointing to the West;
12953,THE BLACKBIRD,"He smiles as though he said--""Thy will be done"":"
12954,THE BLACKBIRD,"His eyes, they see not those illuminings;"
12955,THE BLACKBIRD,"His ears, they hear not what the Blackbird sings."

12967,THE BLACKBIRD,Against the morning beam
12968,THE BLACKBIRD,"I strode beside my team,"
12969,THE BLACKBIRD,
12970,THE BLACKBIRD,The blackbird in the coppice

12972,THE BLACKBIRD,And hearkened as I whistled
12973,THE BLACKBIRD,"The trampling team beside,"
12974,THE BLACKBIRD,And fluted and replied:

12976,THE BLACKBIRD,"""Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;"

12981,THE BLACKBIRD,
12982,THE BLACKBIRD,"I heard the tune he sang me,"
12983,THE BLACKBIRD,And spied his yellow bill;
12984,THE BLACKBIRD,I picked a stone and aimed it
12985,THE BLACKBIRD,And threw it with a will:
12986,THE BLACKBIRD,Then the bird was still.
12987,THE BLACKBIRD,
12988,THE BLACKBIRD,Then my soul within me
12989,THE BLACKBIRD,"Took up the blackbird's strain,"
12990,THE BLACKBIRD,And still beside the horses
12991,THE BLACKBIRD,Along the dewy lane
12992,THE BLACKBIRD,It sang the song again:
12993,THE BLACKBIRD,
12994,THE BLACKBIRD,"""Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;"
12995,THE BLACKBIRD,The sun moves always west;
12996,THE BLACKBIRD,The road one treads to labor
12997,THE BLACKBIRD,"Will lead one home to rest,"
12998,THE BLACKBIRD,"And that will be the best."""

14021,THE NIGHTINGALE,She fled the solemn shade.
14022,THE NIGHTINGALE,
14023,THE NIGHTINGALE,But hark!  I hear her liquid tone!
14024,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Now, Hesper, guide my feet"
14025,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Down the red marl with moss o'ergrown,"
14026,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Through yon wild thicket next the plain,"
14027,THE NIGHTINGALE,Whose hawthorns choke the winding lane
14028,THE NIGHTINGALE,Which leads to her retreat.
14029,THE NIGHTINGALE,
14030,THE NIGHTINGALE,See the green space: on either hand
14031,THE NIGHTINGALE,Enlarged it spreads around:
14032,THE NIGHTINGALE,"See, in the midst she takes her stand,"
14033,THE NIGHTINGALE,Where one old oak his awful shade
14034,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Extends o'er half the level mead,"
14035,THE NIGHTINGALE,Enclosed in woods profound.
14036,THE NIGHTINGALE,
14037,THE NIGHTINGALE,Hark! how through many a melting note
14038,THE NIGHTINGALE,She now prolongs her lays:
14039,THE NIGHTINGALE,How sweetly down the void they float!
14040,THE NIGHTINGALE,The breeze their magic path attends;
14041,THE NIGHTINGALE,The stars shine out; the forest bends;
14042,THE NIGHTINGALE,The wakeful heifers gaze.
14043,THE NIGHTINGALE,
14044,THE NIGHTINGALE,Whoe'er thou art whom chance may bring
14045,THE NIGHTINGALE,"To this sequestered spot,"
14046,THE NIGHTINGALE,"If then the plaintive Siren sing,"
14047,THE NIGHTINGALE,O softly tread beneath her bower
14048,THE NIGHTINGALE,"And think of Heaven's disposing power,"
14049,THE NIGHTINGALE,Of man's uncertain lot.
14050,THE NIGHTINGALE,
14051,THE NIGHTINGALE,"O think, o'er all this mortal stage"
14052,THE NIGHTINGALE,What mournful scenes arise:
14053,THE NIGHTINGALE,What ruin waits on kingly rage;
14054,THE NIGHTINGALE,How often virtue dwells with woe;
14055,THE NIGHTINGALE,How many griefs from knowledge flow;
14056,THE NIGHTINGALE,How swiftly pleasure flies!
14057,THE NIGHTINGALE,
14058,THE NIGHTINGALE,"O sacred bird! let me at eve,"
14059,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Thus wandering all alone,"
14060,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Thy tender counsel oft receive,"

14062,THE NIGHTINGALE,"And pity Nature's common cares,"

14414,THE PEWEE,The listening Dryads hushed the woods;
14415,THE PEWEE,"The boughs were thick, and thin and few"
14416,THE PEWEE,The golden ribbons fluttering through;
14417,THE PEWEE,"Their sun-embroidered, leafy hoods"
14418,THE PEWEE,The lindens lifted to the blue:
14419,THE PEWEE,Only a little forest-brook
14420,THE PEWEE,The farthest hem of silence shook:
14421,THE PEWEE,"When in the hollow shades I heard,--"
14422,THE PEWEE,"Was it a spirit, or a bird?"
14423,THE PEWEE,"Or, strayed from Eden, desolate,"
14424,THE PEWEE,"Some Peri calling to her mate,"
14425,THE PEWEE,Whom nevermore her mate would cheer?
14426,THE PEWEE,"Pe-ri! pe-ri! peer!"""
14427,THE PEWEE,
14428,THE PEWEE,Through rocky clefts the brooklet fell
14429,THE PEWEE,"With plashy pour, that scarce was sound,"
14430,THE PEWEE,"But only quiet less profound,"
14431,THE PEWEE,A stillness fresh and audible:
14432,THE PEWEE,A yellow leaflet to the ground
14433,THE PEWEE,Whirled noiselessly: with wing of gloss
14434,THE PEWEE,"A hovering sunbeam brushed the moss,"
14435,THE PEWEE,"And, wavering brightly over it,"
14436,THE PEWEE,Sat like a butterfly alit:
14437,THE PEWEE,The owlet in his open door
14438,THE PEWEE,Stared roundly: while the breezes bore
14439,THE PEWEE,"The plaint to far-off places drear,--"
14440,THE PEWEE,"""Pe-ree! pe-ree! peer!"""
14441,THE PEWEE,
14442,THE PEWEE,To trace it in its green retreat
14443,THE PEWEE,I sought among the boughs in vain;
14444,THE PEWEE,"And followed still the wandering strain,"
14445,THE PEWEE,So melancholy and so sweet
14446,THE PEWEE,The dim-eyed violets yearned with pain.
14447,THE PEWEE,"'Twas now a sorrow in the air,"
14448,THE PEWEE,Some nymph's immortalized despair
14449,THE PEWEE,Haunting the woods and waterfalls;
14450,THE PEWEE,"And now, at long, sad intervals,"
14451,THE PEWEE,"Sitting unseen in dusky shade,"
14452,THE PEWEE,"His plaintive pipe some fairy played,"
14453,THE PEWEE,"With long-drawn cadence thin and clear,--"
14454,THE PEWEE,"""Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!"""
14455,THE PEWEE,
14456,THE PEWEE,"Long-drawn and clear its closes were,--"
14457,THE PEWEE,As if the hand of Music through
14458,THE PEWEE,The somber robe of Silence drew
14459,THE PEWEE,A thread of golden gossamer:
14460,THE PEWEE,So pure a flute the fairy blew.
14461,THE PEWEE,"Like beggared princes of the wood,"
14462,THE PEWEE,In silver rags the birches stood;
14463,THE PEWEE,"The hemlocks, lordly counselors,"
14464,THE PEWEE,"Were dumb; the sturdy servitors,"
14465,THE PEWEE,"In beechen jackets patched and gray,"
14466,THE PEWEE,Seemed waiting spellbound all the day
14467,THE PEWEE,"That low, entrancing note to hear,--"
14468,THE PEWEE,"""Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!"""
14469,THE PEWEE,
14470,THE PEWEE,"I quit the search, and sat me down"
14471,THE PEWEE,"Beside the brook, irresolute,"
14472,THE PEWEE,And watched a little bird in suit
14473,THE PEWEE,"Of sober olive, soft and brown,"
14474,THE PEWEE,"Perched in the maple-branches, mute:"
14475,THE PEWEE,"With greenish gold its vest was fringed,"
14476,THE PEWEE,"Its tiny cap was ebon-tinged,"
14477,THE PEWEE,"With ivory pale its wings were barred,"
14478,THE PEWEE,And its dark eyes were tender-starred.
14479,THE PEWEE,"""Dear bird,"" I said, ""what is thy name?"""
14480,THE PEWEE,"And thrice the mournful answer came,"
14481,THE PEWEE,"So faint and far, and yet so near,--"
14482,THE PEWEE,"""Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!"""
14483,THE PEWEE,
14484,THE PEWEE,"For so I found my forest bird,--"
14485,THE PEWEE,"The pewee of the loneliest woods,"
14486,THE PEWEE,"Sole singer in these solitudes,"
14487,THE PEWEE,"Which never robin's whistle stirred,"
14488,THE PEWEE,Where never bluebird's plume intrudes.
14489,THE PEWEE,"Quick darting through the dewy morn,"
14490,THE PEWEE,"The redstart trilled his twittering horn,"
14491,THE PEWEE,"And vanished in thick boughs: at even,"
14492,THE PEWEE,"Like liquid pearls fresh showered from heaven,"
14493,THE PEWEE,The high notes of the lone wood-thrush
14494,THE PEWEE,Fall on the forest's holy hush:
14495,THE PEWEE,"But thou all day complainest here,--"
14496,THE PEWEE,"""Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!"""
14497,THE PEWEE,
14498,THE PEWEE,"Hast thou, too, in thy little breast,"
14499,THE PEWEE,"Strange longings for a happier lot,--"
14500,THE PEWEE,"For love, for life, thou know'st not what,--"
14501,THE PEWEE,"A yearning, and a vague unrest,"
14502,THE PEWEE,For something still which thou hast not?--
14503,THE PEWEE,Thou soul of some benighted child
14504,THE PEWEE,"That perished, crying in the wild!"
14505,THE PEWEE,"Or lost, forlorn, and wandering maid,"
14506,THE PEWEE,"By love allured, by love betrayed,"
14507,THE PEWEE,Whose spirit with her latest sigh
14508,THE PEWEE,"Arose, a little winged cry,"
14509,THE PEWEE,Above her chill and mossy bier!
14510,THE PEWEE,"""Dear me! dear me! dear!"""
14511,THE PEWEE,
14512,THE PEWEE,"Ah, no such piercing sorrow mars"
14513,THE PEWEE,The pewee's life of cheerful ease!
14514,THE PEWEE,"He sings, or leaves his song to seize"
14515,THE PEWEE,An insect sporting in the bars
14516,THE PEWEE,Of mild bright light that gild the trees.
14517,THE PEWEE,A very poet he!  For him
14518,THE PEWEE,All pleasant places still and dim:
14519,THE PEWEE,"His heart, a spark of heavenly fire,"
14520,THE PEWEE,"Burns with undying, sweet desire:"
14521,THE PEWEE,"And so he sings; and so his song,"
14522,THE PEWEE,"Though heard not by the hurrying throng,"
14523,THE PEWEE,Is solace to the pensive ear:

14653,THE SEA-MEW,Familiar with the waves and free

14656,THE SEA-MEW,"Lay learning all its mystic motion,"

14658,THE SEA-MEW,
14659,THE SEA-MEW,"And such a brightness in his eye,"

14665,THE SEA-MEW,"We were not cruel, yet did sunder"

14680,THE SEA-MEW,"He thought of ocean's winged spray,"

14816,THE SKYLARK,Fills it with jubilant sweet songs of mirth;
14817,THE SKYLARK,"How far he seems, how far"
14818,THE SKYLARK,"With the light upon his wings,"
14819,THE SKYLARK,"Is it a bird, or star"

14832,THE SKYLARK,"In streams of gold and purple he is drowned,"
14833,THE SKYLARK,"Shrilly the arrows of his song he shivers,"

14974,TO A SKYLARK,A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
14975,TO A SKYLARK,
14976,TO A SKYLARK,What objects are the fountains
14977,TO A SKYLARK,Of thy happy strain?
14978,TO A SKYLARK,"What fields, or waves, or mountains?"
14979,TO A SKYLARK,What shapes of sky or plain?
14980,TO A SKYLARK,What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
14981,TO A SKYLARK,
14982,TO A SKYLARK,With thy clear keen joyance
14983,TO A SKYLARK,Languor cannot be:
14984,TO A SKYLARK,Shadow of annoyance
14985,TO A SKYLARK,Never came near thee:

14987,TO A SKYLARK,
14988,TO A SKYLARK,"Waking or asleep,"

14993,TO A SKYLARK,

14999,TO A SKYLARK,
15000,TO A SKYLARK,Yet if we could scorn
15001,TO A SKYLARK,"Hate, and pride, and fear;"

15166,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,"I heard the dream of lovers, as they found"
15167,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,"At last their hour of bliss,"

15199,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,Snow storm and sunny showers;
15200,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,
15201,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,And secrets of the soul that doubts and yearns
15202,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,"And gropes in regions dim,"

15204,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,Its perfect life in Him.
15205,CHIMNEY SWALLOWS,

17381,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,We must bury the dead!
17382,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17383,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"It is but a Danish sailor,"
17384,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,Rugged of front and form;
17385,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"A common son of the forecastle,"
17386,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,Grizzled with sun and storm.
17387,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17388,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"His name, and the strand he hailed from"
17389,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"We know, and there's nothing more!"
17390,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,But perhaps his mother is waiting
17391,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,In the lonely Island of Fohr.
17392,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17393,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Still, as he lay there dying,"

17397,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17398,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Aye, on deck, by the foremast!"
17399,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,But watch and lookout are done;
17400,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"The Union Jack laid o'er him,"
17401,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,How quiet he lies in the sun!
17402,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17403,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Slow the ponderous engine,"

17409,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17410,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Stand in order, and listen"
17411,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,To the holiest page of prayer!
17412,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Let every foot be quiet,"
17413,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,Every head be bare--
17414,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,The soft trade-wind is lifting
17415,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,A hundred locks of hair.
17416,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17417,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Our captain reads the service,"
17418,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,(A little spray on his cheeks)

17427,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,"Plunges, away from the shark,"

17430,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,
17431,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,A thousand summers and winters
17432,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,The stormy Gulf shall roll
17433,THE BURIAL OF THE DANE,High o'er his canvas coffin;

17463,TOM BOWLING,
17464,TOM BOWLING,"Tom never from his word departed,"

17468,TOM BOWLING,"And then he'd sing, so blithe and jolly,"

17490,MESSMATES,At the first dawn of day;
17491,MESSMATES,We dropped him down the side full drearily
17492,MESSMATES,When the light died away.
17493,MESSMATES,"It's a dead dark watch that he's a-keeping there,"

17497,MESSMATES,

17507,MESSMATES,"I wonder if the tramps come near enough,"

17524,THE LAST BUCCANEER,But England is a cruel place for such poor folks as I;
17525,THE LAST BUCCANEER,And such a port for mariners I ne'er shall see again
17526,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"As the pleasant Isle of Aves, beside the Spanish main."
17527,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17528,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"There were forty craft in Aves that were both swift and stout,"
17529,THE LAST BUCCANEER,All furnished well with small arms and cannons round about;
17530,THE LAST BUCCANEER,And a thousand men in Aves made laws so fair and free
17531,THE LAST BUCCANEER,To choose their valiant captains and obey them loyally.
17532,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17533,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Thence we sailed against the Spaniard with his hoards of plate and gold,"
17534,THE LAST BUCCANEER,Which he wrung with cruel tortures from Indian folk of old;
17535,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Likewise the merchant captains, with hearts as hard as stone,"
17536,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Who flog men and keelhaul them, and starve them to the bone."
17537,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17538,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Oh, the palms grew high in Aves, and fruits that shone like gold,"
17539,THE LAST BUCCANEER,And the colibris and parrots they were gorgeous to behold;
17540,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"And the negro maids to Aves from bondage fast did flee,"
17541,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"To welcome gallant sailors, a-sweeping in from sea."
17542,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17543,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Oh, sweet it was in Aves to hear the landward breeze,"
17544,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"A-swing with good tobacco in a net between the trees,"
17545,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"With a negro lass to fan you, while you listened to the roar"

17547,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17548,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"But Scripture saith, an ending to all fine things must be;"
17549,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"So the King's ships sailed on Aves, and quite put down were we."
17550,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"All day we fought like bulldogs, but they burst the booms at night;"
17551,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"And I fled in a piragua, sore wounded, from the fight."
17552,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17553,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Nine days I floated starving, and a negro lass beside,"
17554,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"Till for all I tried to cheer her, the poor young thing she died;"
17555,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"But as I lay a-gasping, a Bristol sail came by,"
17556,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"And brought me home to England here, to beg until I die."
17557,THE LAST BUCCANEER,
17558,THE LAST BUCCANEER,And now I'm old and going--I'm sure I can't tell where;
17559,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"One comfort is, this world's so hard, I can't be worse off there:"
17560,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"If I might but be a sea-dove, I'd fly across the main,"

17585,THE LAST BUCCANEER,"""To-night there shall be heard on the rocks of Cape de Verde"
17586,THE LAST BUCCANEER,A loud crash and a louder roar;

17903,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17904,THE OLD SQUIRE,I like the hunting of the hare
17905,THE OLD SQUIRE,Better than that of the fox;
17906,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I like the joyous morning air,"
17907,THE OLD SQUIRE,And the crowing of the cocks.
17908,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17909,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I like the calm of the early fields,"
17910,THE OLD SQUIRE,"The ducks asleep by the lake,"
17911,THE OLD SQUIRE,The quiet hour which nature yields
17912,THE OLD SQUIRE,Before mankind is awake.
17913,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17914,THE OLD SQUIRE,I like the pheasants and feeding things
17915,THE OLD SQUIRE,Of the unsuspicious morn;
17916,THE OLD SQUIRE,I like the flap of the wood-pigeon's wings
17917,THE OLD SQUIRE,As she rises from the corn.
17918,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17919,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I like the blackbird's shriek, and his rush"
17920,THE OLD SQUIRE,"From the turnips as I pass by,"
17921,THE OLD SQUIRE,"And the partridge hiding her head in a bush,"
17922,THE OLD SQUIRE,For her young ones cannot fly.
17923,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17924,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I like these things, and I like to ride,"
17925,THE OLD SQUIRE,"When all the world is in bed,"
17926,THE OLD SQUIRE,"To the top of the hill where the sky grows wide,"
17927,THE OLD SQUIRE,And where the sun grows red.
17928,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17929,THE OLD SQUIRE,The beagles at my horse-heels trot
17930,THE OLD SQUIRE,In silence after me;
17931,THE OLD SQUIRE,"There's Ruby, Roger, Diamond, Dot,"
17932,THE OLD SQUIRE,"Old Slut and Margery,--"
17933,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17934,THE OLD SQUIRE,"A score of names well used, and dear,"
17935,THE OLD SQUIRE,The names my childhood knew;
17936,THE OLD SQUIRE,"The horn with which I rouse their cheer,"
17937,THE OLD SQUIRE,Is the horn my father blew.
17938,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17939,THE OLD SQUIRE,I like the hunting of the hare
17940,THE OLD SQUIRE,Better than that of the fox;
17941,THE OLD SQUIRE,The new world still is all less fair
17942,THE OLD SQUIRE,Than the old world it mocks.
17943,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17944,THE OLD SQUIRE,I covet not a wider range
17945,THE OLD SQUIRE,Than these dear manors give;
17946,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I take my pleasures without change,"
17947,THE OLD SQUIRE,And as I lived I live.
17948,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17949,THE OLD SQUIRE,I leave my neighbors to their thought;
17950,THE OLD SQUIRE,"My choice it is, and pride,"
17951,THE OLD SQUIRE,"On my own lands to find my sport,"
17952,THE OLD SQUIRE,In my own fields to ride.
17953,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17954,THE OLD SQUIRE,The hare herself no better loves
17955,THE OLD SQUIRE,"The field where she was bred,"
17956,THE OLD SQUIRE,"Than I the habit of these groves,"
17957,THE OLD SQUIRE,My own inherited.
17958,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17959,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I know my quarries every one,"
17960,THE OLD SQUIRE,The meuse where she sits low;
17961,THE OLD SQUIRE,The road she chose to-day was run
17962,THE OLD SQUIRE,A hundred years ago.
17963,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17964,THE OLD SQUIRE,"The lags, the gills, the forest ways,"
17965,THE OLD SQUIRE,"The hedgerows one and all,"
17966,THE OLD SQUIRE,"These are the kingdoms of my chase,"
17967,THE OLD SQUIRE,And bounded by my wall;
17968,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17969,THE OLD SQUIRE,"Nor has the world a better thing,"
17970,THE OLD SQUIRE,"Though one should search it round,"
17971,THE OLD SQUIRE,"Than thus to live one's own sole king,"
17972,THE OLD SQUIRE,Upon one's own sole ground.
17973,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17974,THE OLD SQUIRE,I like the hunting of the hare;
17975,THE OLD SQUIRE,"It brings me, day by day,"
17976,THE OLD SQUIRE,"The memory of old days as fair,"
17977,THE OLD SQUIRE,With dead men passed away.
17978,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17979,THE OLD SQUIRE,"To these, as homeward still I ply"
17980,THE OLD SQUIRE,"And pass the churchyard gate,"
17981,THE OLD SQUIRE,Where all are laid as I must lie
17982,THE OLD SQUIRE,I stop and raise my hat.
17983,THE OLD SQUIRE,
17984,THE OLD SQUIRE,I like the hunting of the hare;
17985,THE OLD SQUIRE,New sports I hold in scorn.
17986,THE OLD SQUIRE,"I like to be as my fathers were,"
17987,THE OLD SQUIRE,In the days ere I was born.

18235,THE CUP,"Many and many a century old,"
18236,THE CUP,"Sculptured fair, and over-filled"
18237,THE CUP,"With wine of a generous vintage, spilled"
18238,THE CUP,In crystal currents and foaming tides
18239,THE CUP,"All round its luminous, pictured sides."
18240,THE CUP,Old Time enameled and embossed
18241,THE CUP,This ancient cup at an infinite cost.
18242,THE CUP,Its frame he wrought of metal that run
18243,THE CUP,Red from the furnace of the sun.
18244,THE CUP,Ages on ages slowly rolled
18245,THE CUP,"Before the glowing mass was cold,"
18246,THE CUP,"And still he toiled at the antique mold,--"
18247,THE CUP,"Turning it fast in his fashioning hand,"
18248,THE CUP,"Tracing circle, layer, and band,"
18249,THE CUP,"Carving figures quaint and strange,"
18250,THE CUP,"Pursuing, through many a wondrous change,"
18251,THE CUP,The symmetry of a plan divine.
18252,THE CUP,"At last he poured the lustrous wine,"
18253,THE CUP,"Crowned high the radiant wave with light,"
18254,THE CUP,"And held aloft the goblet bright,"
18255,THE CUP,"Half in shadow, and wreathed in mist"
18256,THE CUP,"Of purple, amber, and amethyst."
18257,THE CUP,
18258,THE CUP,This is the goblet from whose brink
18259,THE CUP,All creatures that have life must drink:
18260,THE CUP,"Foemen and lovers, haughty lord,"
18261,THE CUP,And sallow beggar with lips abhorred.
18262,THE CUP,"The new-born infant, ere it gain"
18263,THE CUP,"The mother's breast, this wine must drain."
18264,THE CUP,"The oak with its subtle juice is fed,"
18265,THE CUP,"The rose drinks till her cheeks are red,"
18266,THE CUP,"And the dimpled, dainty violet sips"
18267,THE CUP,The limpid stream with loving lips.
18268,THE CUP,"It holds the blood of sun and star,"
18269,THE CUP,And all pure essences that are:
18270,THE CUP,"No fruit so high on the heavenly vine,"
18271,THE CUP,Whose golden hanging clusters shine
18272,THE CUP,"On the far-off shadowy midnight hills,"
18273,THE CUP,But some sweet influence it distils
18274,THE CUP,That slideth down the silvery rills.
18275,THE CUP,"Here Wisdom drowned her dangerous thought,"
18276,THE CUP,The early gods their secrets brought;
18277,THE CUP,"Beauty, in quivering lines of light,"
18278,THE CUP,Ripples before the ravished sight:
18279,THE CUP,And the unseen mystic spheres combine
18280,THE CUP,To charm the cup and drug the wine.
18281,THE CUP,
18282,THE CUP,"All day I drink of the wine, and deep"
18283,THE CUP,In its stainless waves my senses steep;
18284,THE CUP,All night my peaceful soul lies drowned
18285,THE CUP,In hollows of the cup profound;
18286,THE CUP,Again each morn I clamber up
18287,THE CUP,"The emerald crater of the cup,"
18288,THE CUP,On massive knobs of jasper stand
18289,THE CUP,And view the azure ring expand:
18290,THE CUP,I watch the foam-wreaths toss and swim
18291,THE CUP,In the wine that o'erruns the jeweled rim:--
18292,THE CUP,"Edges of chrysolite emerge,"
18293,THE CUP,"Dawn-tinted, from the misty surge:"
18294,THE CUP,"My thrilled, uncovered front I lave,"
18295,THE CUP,"My eager senses kiss the wave,"
18296,THE CUP,"And drain, with its viewless draught, the lore"
18297,THE CUP,"That kindles the bosom's secret core,"
18298,THE CUP,And the fire that maddens the poet's brain
18299,THE CUP,With wild sweet ardor and heavenly pain.

20789,THE VOORTREKKER,"There shall he meet the roaring street, the derrick, and the stamp;"
20790,THE VOORTREKKER,"There he shall blaze a nation's ways with hatchet and with brand,"
20791,THE VOORTREKKER,Till on his last-won wilderness an Empire's outposts stand!

20798,THE LONG TRAIL,THE LONG TRAIL
20799,THE LONG TRAIL,
20800,THE LONG TRAIL,"There's a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield,"
20801,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the ricks stand gray to the sun,"
20802,THE LONG TRAIL,"Singing: ""Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover,"
20803,THE LONG TRAIL,"And your English summer's done."""
20804,THE LONG TRAIL,"You have heard the beat of the off-shore wind,"
20805,THE LONG TRAIL,And the thresh of the deep-sea rain;
20806,THE LONG TRAIL,You have heard the song--how long? how long?
20807,THE LONG TRAIL,Pull out on the trail again!
20808,THE LONG TRAIL,
20809,THE LONG TRAIL,"Ha' done with the Tents of Shem, dear lass,"
20810,THE LONG TRAIL,"We've seen the seasons through,"
20811,THE LONG TRAIL,"And it's time to turn on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20812,THE LONG TRAIL,"Pull out, pull out, on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new!"
20813,THE LONG TRAIL,
20814,THE LONG TRAIL,"It's North you may run to the rime-ringed sun,"
20815,THE LONG TRAIL,Or South to the blind Horn's hate;
20816,THE LONG TRAIL,"Or East all the way into Mississippi Bay,"
20817,THE LONG TRAIL,Or West to the Golden Gate;
20818,THE LONG TRAIL,"Where the blindest bluffs hold good, dear lass,"
20819,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the wildest tales are true,"
20820,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the men bulk big on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20821,THE LONG TRAIL,And life runs large on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
20822,THE LONG TRAIL,
20823,THE LONG TRAIL,"The days are sick and cold, and the skies are gray and old,"
20824,THE LONG TRAIL,And the twice-breathed airs blow damp;
20825,THE LONG TRAIL,And I'd sell my tired soul for the bucking beam-sea roll
20826,THE LONG TRAIL,Of a black Bilbao tramp;
20827,THE LONG TRAIL,"With her load-line over her hatch, dear lass,"
20828,THE LONG TRAIL,"And a drunken Dago crew,"
20829,THE LONG TRAIL,"And her nose held down on the old trail, our own trail,"
20830,THE LONG TRAIL,"the out trail,"
20831,THE LONG TRAIL,From Cadiz south on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
20832,THE LONG TRAIL,
20833,THE LONG TRAIL,"There be triple ways to take, of the eagle or the snake,"
20834,THE LONG TRAIL,Or the way of a man with a maid;
20835,THE LONG TRAIL,But the sweetest way to me is a ship's upon the sea
20836,THE LONG TRAIL,In the heel of the North-East Trade.
20837,THE LONG TRAIL,"Can you hear the crash on her bows, dear lass,"
20838,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the drum of the racing screw,"
20839,THE LONG TRAIL,"As she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20840,THE LONG TRAIL,As she lifts and 'scends on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new?
20841,THE LONG TRAIL,
20842,THE LONG TRAIL,"See the shaking funnels roar, with the Peter at the fore,"
20843,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the fenders grind and heave,"
20844,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,"
20845,THE LONG TRAIL,And the fall-rope whines through the sheave;
20846,THE LONG TRAIL,"It's ""Gang-plank up and in,"" dear lass,"
20847,THE LONG TRAIL,"It's ""Hawsers warp her through!"""
20848,THE LONG TRAIL,"And it's ""All clear aft"" on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20849,THE LONG TRAIL,We're backing down on tile Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
20850,THE LONG TRAIL,
20851,THE LONG TRAIL,"O the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,"
20852,THE LONG TRAIL,And the sirens hoot their dread!
20853,THE LONG TRAIL,When foot by foot we creep o'er the hueless viewless deep
20854,THE LONG TRAIL,To the sob of the questing lead!
20855,THE LONG TRAIL,"It's down by the Lower Hope, dear lass,"
20856,THE LONG TRAIL,"With the Gunfleet Sands in view,"
20857,THE LONG TRAIL,"Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20858,THE LONG TRAIL,And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
20859,THE LONG TRAIL,
20860,THE LONG TRAIL,"O the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light"
20861,THE LONG TRAIL,"That holds the hot sky tame,"
20862,THE LONG TRAIL,And the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powdered floors
20863,THE LONG TRAIL,Where the scared whale flukes in flame!
20864,THE LONG TRAIL,"Her plates are flaked by the sun, dear lass,"
20865,THE LONG TRAIL,"And her ropes are taut with the dew,"
20866,THE LONG TRAIL,"For we're booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20867,THE LONG TRAIL,We're sagging south on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
20868,THE LONG TRAIL,
20869,THE LONG TRAIL,"Then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,"
20870,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the shouting seas drive by,"
20871,THE LONG TRAIL,"And the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,"
20872,THE LONG TRAIL,And the Southern Cross rides high!
20873,THE LONG TRAIL,"Yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,"
20874,THE LONG TRAIL,That blaze in the velvet blue.
20875,THE LONG TRAIL,"They're all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20876,THE LONG TRAIL,They're God's own guides on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new.
20877,THE LONG TRAIL,
20878,THE LONG TRAIL,"Fly forward, O my heart, from the Foreland to the Start--"
20879,THE LONG TRAIL,"We're steaming all too slow,"
20880,THE LONG TRAIL,And it's twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
20881,THE LONG TRAIL,Where the trumpet-orchids blow!
20882,THE LONG TRAIL,You have heard the call of the off-shore wind
20883,THE LONG TRAIL,And the voice of the deep-sea rain;
20884,THE LONG TRAIL,You have heard the song--how long--how long?
20885,THE LONG TRAIL,Pull out on the trail again!
20886,THE LONG TRAIL,
20887,THE LONG TRAIL,"The Lord knows what we may find, dear lass,"
20888,THE LONG TRAIL,And the Deuce knows what we may do--
20889,THE LONG TRAIL,"But we're back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
20890,THE LONG TRAIL,"We're down, hull down, on the Long Trail--the trail that is always new!"
