179,BY THE BABE UNBORN,"Beyond the breaking pale,"
180,BY THE BABE UNBORN,
181,BY THE BABE UNBORN,If a fixed fire hung in the air
182,BY THE BABE UNBORN,"To warm me one day through,"
183,BY THE BABE UNBORN,"If deep green hair grew on great hills,"
184,BY THE BABE UNBORN,I know what I should do.

186,BY THE BABE UNBORN,In dark I lie: dreaming that there
187,BY THE BABE UNBORN,"Are great eyes cold or kind,"

189,BY THE BABE UNBORN,And living men behind.

209,THE WORLD'S LOVER,THE WORLD'S LOVER
210,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
211,THE WORLD'S LOVER,My eyes are full of lonely mirth:
212,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"Reeling with want and worn with scars,"
213,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"For pride of every stone on earth,"
214,THE WORLD'S LOVER,I shake my spear at all the stars.
215,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
216,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"A live bat beats my crest above,"
217,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"Lean foxes nose where I have trod,"
218,THE WORLD'S LOVER,And on my naked face the love
219,THE WORLD'S LOVER,Which is the loneliness of God.
220,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
221,THE WORLD'S LOVER,Outlawed: since that great day gone by--
222,THE WORLD'S LOVER,When before prince and pope and queen
223,THE WORLD'S LOVER,I stood and spoke a blasphemy--
224,THE WORLD'S LOVER,'Behold the summer leaves are green.'
225,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
226,THE WORLD'S LOVER,They cursed me: what was that to me
227,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"Who in that summer darkness furled,"
228,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"With but an owl and snail to see,"
229,THE WORLD'S LOVER,Had blessed and conquered all the world?
230,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
231,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"They bound me to the scourging-stake,"
232,THE WORLD'S LOVER,They laid their whips of thorn on me;
233,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"I wept to see the green rods break,"
234,THE WORLD'S LOVER,Though blood be beautiful to see.
235,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
236,THE WORLD'S LOVER,Beneath the gallows' foot abhorred
237,THE WORLD'S LOVER,The crowds cry 'Crucify!' and 'Kill!'
238,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"Higher the priests sing, 'Praise the Lord,"
239,THE WORLD'S LOVER,The warlock dies'; and higher still
240,THE WORLD'S LOVER,
241,THE WORLD'S LOVER,Shall heaven and earth hear one cry sent
242,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"Even from the hideous gibbet height,"
243,THE WORLD'S LOVER,"'Praise to the Lord Omnipotent,"
244,THE WORLD'S LOVER,The vultures have a feast to-night.'

252,THE SKELETON,Are not merrier than I;
253,THE SKELETON,Here among the flowers I lie
254,THE SKELETON,Laughing everlastingly.
255,THE SKELETON,No: I may not tell the best;
256,THE SKELETON,"Surely, friends, I might have guessed"
257,THE SKELETON,"Death was but the good King's jest,"
258,THE SKELETON,It was hid so carefully.

264,A CHORD OF COLOUR,
265,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"My Lady clad herself in grey,"
266,A CHORD OF COLOUR,That caught and clung about her throat;
267,A CHORD OF COLOUR,Then all the long grey winter day
268,A CHORD OF COLOUR,On me a living splendour smote;
269,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"And why grey palmers holy are,"
270,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"And why grey minsters great in story,"
271,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"And grey skies ring the morning star,"
272,A CHORD OF COLOUR,And grey hairs are a crown of glory.
273,A CHORD OF COLOUR,
274,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"My Lady clad herself in green,"
275,A CHORD OF COLOUR,Like meadows where the wind-waves pass;
276,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"Then round my spirit spread, I ween,"
277,A CHORD OF COLOUR,A splendour of forgotten grass.
278,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"Then all that dropped of stem or sod,"
279,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"Hoarded as emeralds might be,"
280,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"I bowed to every bush, and trod"
281,A CHORD OF COLOUR,Amid the live grass fearfully.
282,A CHORD OF COLOUR,
283,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"My Lady clad herself in blue,"
284,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"Then on me, like the seer long gone,"
285,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"The likeness of a sapphire grew,"
286,A CHORD OF COLOUR,The throne of him that sat thereon.
287,A CHORD OF COLOUR,Then knew I why the Fashioner
288,A CHORD OF COLOUR,Splashed reckless blue on sky and sea;
289,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"And ere 'twas good enough for her,"
290,A CHORD OF COLOUR,He tried it on Eternity.
291,A CHORD OF COLOUR,
292,A CHORD OF COLOUR,Beneath the gnarled old Knowledge-tree
293,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"Sat, like an owl, the evil sage:"
294,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"'The World's a bubble,' solemnly"
295,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"He read, and turned a second page."
296,A CHORD OF COLOUR,"'A bubble, then, old crow,' I cried,"
297,A CHORD OF COLOUR,'God keep you in your weary wit!
298,A CHORD OF COLOUR,'A bubble--have you ever spied
299,A CHORD OF COLOUR,'The colours I have seen on it?'

305,THE HAPPY MAN,
306,THE HAPPY MAN,"To teach the grey earth like a child,"
307,THE HAPPY MAN,"To bid the heavens repent,"
308,THE HAPPY MAN,I only ask from Fate the gift
309,THE HAPPY MAN,Of one man well content.
310,THE HAPPY MAN,
311,THE HAPPY MAN,Him will I find: though when in vain
312,THE HAPPY MAN,"I search the feast and mart,"
313,THE HAPPY MAN,"The fading flowers of liberty,"
314,THE HAPPY MAN,The painted masks of art.
315,THE HAPPY MAN,
316,THE HAPPY MAN,"I only find him at the last,"
317,THE HAPPY MAN,On one old hill where nod
318,THE HAPPY MAN,Golgotha's ghastly trinity--
319,THE HAPPY MAN,Three persons and one god.

328,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"He gave me sun and stars and ought He could,"
329,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,But not a woman's love; for that is hers.
330,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,
331,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,He sealed her heart from sage and questioner--
332,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"Yea, with seven seals, as he has sealed the grave."
333,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"And if she give it to a drunken slave,"
334,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,The Day of Judgment shall not challenge her.
335,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,
336,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"Only this much: if one, deserving well,"
337,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"Touching your thin young hands and making suit,"
338,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"Feel not himself a crawling thing, a brute,"
339,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,Buried and bricked in a forgotten hell;
340,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,
341,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"Prophet and poet be he over sod,"
342,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"Prince among angels in the highest place,"
343,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,"God help me, I will smite him on the face,"
344,THE UNPARDONABLE SIN,Before the glory of the face of God.

357,A NOVELTY,
358,A NOVELTY,Why should I bow to the Ages
359,A NOVELTY,Because they were drear and dry?
360,A NOVELTY,Slow trees and ripening meadows
361,A NOVELTY,"For me go roaring by,"
362,A NOVELTY,"A living charge, a struggle"

392,THE DONKEY,When fishes flew and forests walked
393,THE DONKEY,"And figs grew upon thorn,"
394,THE DONKEY,Some moment when the moon was blood
395,THE DONKEY,Then surely I was born;
396,THE DONKEY,
397,THE DONKEY,With monstrous head and sickening cry
398,THE DONKEY,"And ears like errant wings,"
399,THE DONKEY,The devil's walking parody

401,THE DONKEY,

405,THE DONKEY,I keep my secret still.
406,THE DONKEY,
407,THE DONKEY,Fools! For I also had my hour;

420,THE BEATIFIC VISION,To see a dandelion grow?
421,THE BEATIFIC VISION,
422,THE BEATIFIC VISION,"Well, if in any woes or wars"
423,THE BEATIFIC VISION,"I bought my naked right to be,"

440,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,The thunder and the splendour of the sea.

442,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,"Give back the Babylon where I was born,"
443,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,"The lips that gape give back, the hands that grope,"

445,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,An eddy of fierce faces--and a hope
446,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,
447,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,"That 'mid those myriad heads one head find place,"
448,THE HOPE OF THE STREETS,"With brown hair curled like breakers of the sea,"

461,ECCLESIASTES,
462,ECCLESIASTES,There is one creed: 'neath no world-terror's wing

475,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,Who loved us long ago.
476,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,
477,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,"The grown folk mighty and cunning,"
478,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,They write his name in gold;
479,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,But we can tell a little
480,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,Of the million tales he told.
481,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,
482,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,"He taught them laws and watchwords,"
483,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,To preach and struggle and pray;
484,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,But he taught us deep in the hayfield
485,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,The games that the angels play.
486,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,
487,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,"Had he stayed here for ever,"
488,THE SONG OF THE CHILDREN,Their world would be wise as ours--

505,THE FISH,Flying in those fallen skies.
506,THE FISH,
507,THE FISH,"I have heard the hoarse deniers,"
508,THE FISH,I have known the wordy wars;

510,THE FISH,Seek to orphan all the stars.
511,THE FISH,
512,THE FISH,I have seen a fool half-fashioned
513,THE FISH,"Borrow from the heavens a tongue,"
514,THE FISH,So to curse them more at leisure--
515,THE FISH,--And I trod him not as dung.
516,THE FISH,
517,THE FISH,For I saw that finny goblin
518,THE FISH,Hidden in the abyss untrod;
519,THE FISH,And I knew there can be laughter
520,THE FISH,On the secret face of God.
521,THE FISH,

556,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,
557,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,I had grown weary of him; of his breath
558,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,And hands and features I was sick to death.
559,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,Each day I heard the same dull voice and tread;
560,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,I did not hate him: but I wished him dead.
561,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,And he must with his blank face fill my life--
562,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,Then my brain blackened; and I snatched a knife.
563,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,
564,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,"But ere I struck, my soul's grey deserts through"
565,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,"A voice cried, 'Know at least what thing you do.'"

571,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,Now know you well your deed and purpose. Slay!'
572,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,
573,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,Then I cast down the knife upon the ground
574,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,And saw that mean man for one moment crowned.
575,THOU SHALT NOT KILL,I turned and laughed: for there was no one by--

613,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,All day the nations climb and crawl and pray
614,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"In one long pilgrimage to one white shrine,"
615,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Where sleeps a saint whose pardon, like his peace,"
616,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Is wide as death, as common, as divine."
617,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
618,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"His statue in an aureole fills the shrine,"

622,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
623,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"But one strange night, a night of gale and flood,"
624,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,A sound came louder than the wild wind's tone;
625,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,The grave-gates shook and opened: and one stood
626,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Blue in the moonlight, rotten to the bone."
627,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
628,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Then on the statue, graven with holy smiles,"
629,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,There came another smile--tremendous--one
630,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Of an Egyptian god. 'Why should you rise?
631,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,'Do I not guard your secret from the sun?
632,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
633,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,The nations come; they kneel among the flowers
634,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Sprung from your blood, blossoms of May and June,"
635,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Which do not poison them--is it not strange?
636,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Speak!' And the dead man shuddered in the moon.
637,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
638,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Shall I not cry the truth?'--the dead man cowered--
639,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Is it not sad, with life so tame and cold,"
640,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,What earth should fade into the sun's white fires
641,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,With the best jest in all its tales untold?
642,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
643,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,'If I should cry that in this shrine lie hid
644,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Stories that Satan from his mouth would spew;
645,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Wild tales that men in hell tell hoarsely--speak!
646,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Saint and Deliverer!  Should I slander you?'
647,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
648,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Slowly the cowering corse reared up its head,"
649,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"'Nay, I am vile ... but when for all to see,"
650,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"You stand there, pure and painless--death of life!"
651,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Let the stars fall--I say you slander me!
652,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
653,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"'You make me perfect, public, colourless;"
654,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,You make my virtues sit at ease--you lie!
655,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"For mine were never easy--lost or saved,"
656,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,I had a soul--I was. And where am I?
657,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
658,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Where is my good? the little real hoard,"
659,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"The secret tears, the sudden chivalries;"
660,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"The tragic love, the futile triumph--where?"
661,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Thief, dog, and son of devils--where are these?"
662,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
663,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,I will lift up my head: in leprous loves
664,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Lost, and the soul's dishonourable scars--"
665,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,By God I was a better man than This
666,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,That stands and slanders me to all the stars.
667,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
668,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"'Come down!' And with an awful cry, the corse"
669,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Sprang on the sacred tomb of many tales,"
670,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"And stone and bone, locked in a loathsome strife,"
671,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Swayed to the singing of the nightingales.
672,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
673,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Then one was thrown: and where the statue stood
674,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"Under the canopy, above the lawn,"
675,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,"The corse stood; grey and lean, with lifted hands"
676,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,Raised in tremendous welcome to the dawn.
677,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,
678,A MAN AND HIS IMAGE,'Now let all nations climb and crawl and pray;

2629,LORD ORM.,To prove I am that man.
2630,LORD ORM.,That while these saints
2631,LORD ORM.,"Taunt me with trembling, dare me to revenge,"
2632,LORD ORM.,I breathe an upper air of ancient good
2633,LORD ORM.,And strong eternal laughter; send my sun
2634,LORD ORM.,"And rain upon the evil and the just,"
2635,LORD ORM.,Turn my left cheek unto the smiter. He
2636,LORD ORM.,"That told me, sword in hand, that I had fallen"
2637,LORD ORM.,"Lower than anger, knew not I had risen"
2638,LORD ORM.,Higher than pride....
2639,LORD ORM.,"Enough, the deeds are mine."
2640,LORD ORM.,
2641,LORD ORM.,[_Takes out the title-deeds._]
2642,LORD ORM.,
2643,LORD ORM.,I come to write the end of a romance.
2644,LORD ORM.,A good romance: the characters--Lord Orm.
2645,LORD ORM.,"Type of the starvéd heart and storéd brain,"
2646,LORD ORM.,Who strives to hate and cannot; fronting him--
2647,LORD ORM.,"Redfeather, rake in process of reform,"
2648,LORD ORM.,At root a poet: I have hopes of him:
2649,LORD ORM.,"He can love virtue, for he still loves vice."
2650,LORD ORM.,He is not all burnt out. He beats me there
2651,LORD ORM.,(How I beat him in owning it!); in love
2652,LORD ORM.,"He is still young, and has the joy of shame."
2653,LORD ORM.,And for the Lady Olive--who shall speak?
2654,LORD ORM.,"A man may weigh the courage of a man,"
2655,LORD ORM.,But if there be a bottomless abyss
2656,LORD ORM.,It is a woman's valour: such as I
2657,LORD ORM.,Can only bow the knee and hide the face
2658,LORD ORM.,(Thank God there is no God to spy on me
2659,LORD ORM.,And bring his curséd crowns).
2660,LORD ORM.,"No, there is none:"
2661,LORD ORM.,The old incurable hunger of the world
2662,LORD ORM.,"Surges in wolfish wars, age after age."
2663,LORD ORM.,"There was no God before me: none sees where,"
2664,LORD ORM.,"Between the brute-womb and the deaf, dead grave,"
2665,LORD ORM.,"Unhoping, unrecorded, unrepaid,"
2666,LORD ORM.,"I make with smoke, fire, and burnt-offering"
2667,LORD ORM.,This sacrifice to Chaos. [_Lights the papers._] None behold
2668,LORD ORM.,Me write in fire the end of the romance.
2669,LORD ORM.,"Burn! I am God, and crown myself with stars."
2670,LORD ORM.,Upon creation day: before was night
2671,LORD ORM.,And chaos of a blind and cruel world.
2672,LORD ORM.,"I am the first God; I will trample hell,"
2673,LORD ORM.,"Fight, conquer, make the story of the stars,"
2674,LORD ORM.,"Like this poor story, end like a romance:"
2675,LORD ORM.,
2676,LORD ORM.,[_The paper burns._]
2677,LORD ORM.,
2678,LORD ORM.,Before was brainless night: but I am God
2679,LORD ORM.,In this black world I rend. Let there be light!
2680,LORD ORM.,
2681,LORD ORM.,"[_The paper blazes up, illuminating the garden._]"
2682,LORD ORM.,
2683,LORD ORM.,"I, God ..."
2684,LORD ORM.,
2685,LORD ORM.,THE WILD KNIGHT [_rushes forward_].
2686,LORD ORM.,
2687,LORD ORM.,"God's Light! God's Voice; yes, it is He"
2688,LORD ORM.,Walking in Eden in the cool of the day!
2689,LORD ORM.,
2690,LORD ORM.,LORD ORM [_screams_].
2691,LORD ORM.,
2692,LORD ORM.,Tricked! Caught!
2693,LORD ORM.,Damned screeching rat in a hole!
2694,LORD ORM.,
2695,LORD ORM.,[_Stabs him again and again with his sword; stamps on his face._]
2696,LORD ORM.,
2697,LORD ORM.,THE WILD KNIGHT [_faintly_].
2698,LORD ORM.,
2699,LORD ORM.,Earth grows too beautiful around me: shapes
2700,LORD ORM.,"And colours fearfully wax fair and clear,"
2701,LORD ORM.,"For I have heard, as thro' a door ajar,"
2702,LORD ORM.,Scraps of the huge soliloquy of God
2703,LORD ORM.,"That moveth as a mask the lips of man,"
2704,LORD ORM.,"If man be very silent: they were right,"
2705,LORD ORM.,No flesh shall look upon the Lord and live.
2706,LORD ORM.,
2707,LORD ORM.,[_Dies._]
2708,LORD ORM.,
2709,LORD ORM.,LORD ORM [_staggers back laughing_].
2710,LORD ORM.,
2711,LORD ORM.,"Saved, saved, my secret."
2712,LORD ORM.,
2713,LORD ORM.,"REDFEATHER [_rushing in, sword in hand_]."
2714,LORD ORM.,
2715,LORD ORM.,The drawn sword at last!
2716,LORD ORM.,"Guard, son of hell!"
2717,LORD ORM.,
2718,LORD ORM.,[_They fight. ORM falls. OLIVE comes in._]
2719,LORD ORM.,
2720,LORD ORM.,He too can die. Keep back!
2721,LORD ORM.,"Olive, keep back from him! I did not fear"
2722,LORD ORM.,"Him living, and he fell before my sword;"
2723,LORD ORM.,But dead I fear him. All is ended now;
2724,LORD ORM.,"A man's whole life tied in a bundle there,"
2725,LORD ORM.,And no good deed. I fear him. Come away.
2726,LORD ORM.,
