51,THE BANKRUPT.,
52,THE BANKRUPT.,"Oft have you pray'd me, when in youth,"
53,THE BANKRUPT.,Never to err from paths of truth;
54,THE BANKRUPT.,"But youth to vice is much too prone,"
55,THE BANKRUPT.,"And mine by far too much, I own."
56,THE BANKRUPT.,"Induced to riot, swear, and game,"
57,THE BANKRUPT.,I thought in vice t'acquire a fame;
58,THE BANKRUPT.,But found the pois'ning scenes of riot
59,THE BANKRUPT.,Soon robb'd my mind of joy and quiet.
60,THE BANKRUPT.,"The usual course of rakes I ran,"
61,THE BANKRUPT.,The dupe of woman and of man.
62,THE BANKRUPT.,"Careless of fortune's smile or frown,"
63,THE BANKRUPT.,"My desk I left t'enjoy the town,"
64,THE BANKRUPT.,"At folly dash'd in wisdom's spite,"
65,THE BANKRUPT.,"Idled by day, revell'd by night:"
66,THE BANKRUPT.,"But short was the delusive scene,"
67,THE BANKRUPT.,And I awoke to sorrow keen.
68,THE BANKRUPT.,"Debt press'd on debt: I could not pay,"
69,THE BANKRUPT.,And found that credit had its day.
70,THE BANKRUPT.,"No friend to aid, what should I do?"
71,THE BANKRUPT.,I made bad worse: to liquor flew:
72,THE BANKRUPT.,"For when my bill-book I survey'd,"
73,THE BANKRUPT.,"I shrunk, as if I'd seen my shade;"
74,THE BANKRUPT.,"And to drive terror from my mind,"
75,THE BANKRUPT.,"Drank on, and care gave to the wind:"
76,THE BANKRUPT.,But wine nor words can charm away
77,THE BANKRUPT.,The banker's clerk who comes for pay.
78,THE BANKRUPT.,"Payment is press'd, the cash is gone:"
79,THE BANKRUPT.,"Too late I cry, 'What must be done?'"
80,THE BANKRUPT.,Horror! a docket struck appears:
81,THE BANKRUPT.,"I look aghast, my wife's in tears."
82,THE BANKRUPT.,"The naked truth now stares me in the face,"
83,THE BANKRUPT.,And shows me more than one disgrace.
84,THE BANKRUPT.,My keys a messenger demands;
85,THE BANKRUPT.,"While, as a culprit often stands,"
86,THE BANKRUPT.,"The humbled bankrupt lowers his view,"
87,THE BANKRUPT.,And sees the law its work pursue.
88,THE BANKRUPT.,"Soon comes of all his goods the sale,"
89,THE BANKRUPT.,"Which, like light straw before a gale,"
90,THE BANKRUPT.,"The hammer-man puffs clean away,"
91,THE BANKRUPT.,"And cries, 'They must be sold this day.'"
92,THE BANKRUPT.,"They are so, and I'll tell you how:"
93,THE BANKRUPT.,At loss you'll readily allow.
94,THE BANKRUPT.,"Then comes the tedious, humbling task,"
95,THE BANKRUPT.,To answer all commiss'ners ask;
96,THE BANKRUPT.,And those who mean to act most fair
97,THE BANKRUPT.,"Will at first meeting e'er appear,"
98,THE BANKRUPT.,"To questions ask'd will answer true,"
99,THE BANKRUPT.,And clearly state accounts to view.
100,THE BANKRUPT.,"A second he need not attend,"
101,THE BANKRUPT.,But if not may perhaps offend.
102,THE BANKRUPT.,Happy the man who then can lay
103,THE BANKRUPT.,"His hand upon his heart, and say,"
104,THE BANKRUPT.,'You all my books and deeds may scan:
105,THE BANKRUPT.,"I'm honest, though distressed man."
106,THE BANKRUPT.,"My own just wants, and losses great,"
107,THE BANKRUPT.,Have brought me to this low estate.'
108,THE BANKRUPT.,"Then comes the last dread meeting on,"
109,THE BANKRUPT.,"Dreadful to such as will act wrong,"
110,THE BANKRUPT.,And through dishonesty or shame
111,THE BANKRUPT.,Evasive answers 'tempt to frame:
112,THE BANKRUPT.,"For vain his shifts; howe'er he try,"
113,THE BANKRUPT.,He can't elude the searching eye
114,THE BANKRUPT.,"Of lawyers, who'll in all things pry:"
115,THE BANKRUPT.,His private foibles e'en must out--
116,THE BANKRUPT.,Grievous exposure 'tis no doubt!
117,THE BANKRUPT.,"And if he's fraud'lent found, must go"
118,THE BANKRUPT.,To witness scenes of vice and woe;
119,THE BANKRUPT.,"Of liberty deprived, to wail"
120,THE BANKRUPT.,His faults and folly in a gaol:
121,THE BANKRUPT.,"But should his conduct seem least fair,"
122,THE BANKRUPT.,England's blest laws will set him clear;
123,THE BANKRUPT.,"Not only so, but means will give"
124,THE BANKRUPT.,T'enable him again to live:
125,THE BANKRUPT.,"For such the law, that when 'tis found"
126,THE BANKRUPT.,"There's fifteen shillings in the pound,"
127,THE BANKRUPT.,"A handsome drawback he's allow'd,"
128,THE BANKRUPT.,"When, 'stead of shamed, he may look proud;"
129,THE BANKRUPT.,"And be his div'dend e'er so low,"
130,THE BANKRUPT.,They'll never let him coinless go.
131,THE BANKRUPT.,"Yes, be it e'er a Briton's pride,"
132,THE BANKRUPT.,That mercy in his courts preside.
133,THE BANKRUPT.,"But e'er he's paid, he must await"
134,THE BANKRUPT.,T'obtain a fair certificate.
135,THE BANKRUPT.,Some cases there however are
136,THE BANKRUPT.,"Which, at first view, may seem severe:"
137,THE BANKRUPT.,Suppose his creditors are ten;
138,THE BANKRUPT.,"Four sign, the rest refuse: what then?"
139,THE BANKRUPT.,If their demand exceed the four
140,THE BANKRUPT.,They'll keep the bankrupt in their pow'r;
141,THE BANKRUPT.,"And although he has all resign'd,"
142,THE BANKRUPT.,"If unproved debts remain behind,"
143,THE BANKRUPT.,Inhuman creditors then may
144,THE BANKRUPT.,"His body into prison lay,"
145,THE BANKRUPT.,"Where oft the wretch, to sooth his grief,"
146,THE BANKRUPT.,In dissipation seeks relief.
147,THE BANKRUPT.,Sometimes a parent may prevent
148,THE BANKRUPT.,Unmeaningly the law's intent;
149,THE BANKRUPT.,And merc'less creditors decline
150,THE BANKRUPT.,"The hapless debtor's deed to sign,"
151,THE BANKRUPT.,In hopes the father may one day
152,THE BANKRUPT.,The long-neglected son's debts pay.

159,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,THE WRETCHED PAIR.
160,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,
161,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,
162,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Oh, sir! I pray, before you leave this life,"
163,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Extend forgiveness to my injured wife.
164,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Why cast her from your presence?  Say the cause?
165,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Faithful she's kept the strict connubial law's.
166,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"The seven years I pass'd with her in love,"
167,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"She e'er a faithful, virtuous wife did prove."
168,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Was she too gay in dress to please your mind,"
169,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,That you to her so long have been unkind?
170,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Did she too much in company appear?
171,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,She scarcely did that twice or thrice a year.
172,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,I'm told you say her manners were too high:
173,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,'Twas you who view'd her with a scornful eye;
174,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"And that because she'd little store of wealth,"
175,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Which still was lessen'd to improve her health.
176,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Say, should the want of wealth produce such strife,"
177,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,When virtue only guided her through life?
178,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"I loved her: though her fortune was so scant,"
179,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Her fond endearment made me feel no want;
180,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"And spite of all that malice yet has done,"
181,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"We are, though parted, still two hearts in one."
182,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"What was it then that canker'd thus your mind,"
183,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,And made you to her many virtues blind?
184,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Why did she ever sullen pride receive?
185,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Contempt a female heart must ever grieve.
186,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Th'unfeeling world, when adverse gales prevail,"
187,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Arraign your conduct, at your actions rail:"
188,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Should fortune smile, your company they'll crave,"
189,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,And swear you may their all command and have;
190,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"But should a change of fortune e'er take place,"
191,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Their friendship's gone, and they'll e'en shun your face:"
192,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"So long as you a guinea free can spend,"
193,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Talk nonsense, and drink hard, you'll be a friend:"
194,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"They'll say you're clever, generous, and wise;"
195,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"But, if you're poor, the same will you despise."
196,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Creatures like such too many have I found,"
197,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,And sorry am so many still abound.
198,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Fathers, like other men, will change with times,"
199,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"And, when it nothing costs, will wink at crimes;"
200,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"But if assistance you should ever crave,"
201,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Their answer is, 'I wish you in the grave.'"
202,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"My worthy sire will part with good advice,"
203,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,But with his guineas is extremely nice;
204,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"For me cares little, but too much for's store:"
205,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,He only grieves because it is not more;
206,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"And once when he was bidding me adieu,"
207,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Said 'twas much cheaper to keep one than two,"
208,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Meaning to say he grudged to keep my wife:
209,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,This was the logic he had learn'd in life.
210,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Had nature gifted him with callous heart,"
211,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Less tender feeling could he e'er impart?
212,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,But to return to female cause again:
213,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Why should she from me sever'd still remain?
214,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,The only cause I have her not in view
215,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Is the contempt she e'er received from you.
216,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"When at your house, she such did ever find:"
217,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,'Twas that alone which hurt her peace of mind.
218,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Not long ago she came yourself to see;
219,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,But did you ask her any thing of me?
220,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,In tears she told you I was in distress:
221,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,You with much anger did such words express:
222,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"''Tis half your fault,' said you with scornful brow."
223,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"That charge is false, the world and I well know."
224,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Nor did you to her any time impart
225,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Sweet consolation to assuage her heart;
226,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"But cheerful went abroad your friends to see,"
227,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,While home she kept to brood on misery.
228,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"One fault she did commit, I've heard you say:"
229,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,'Twas without leave quitting your house one day;
230,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"But why she did so, was to each one plain:"
231,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Who with such treatment could with you remain?
232,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Oft is the world deceived by artful mien:
233,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,The real temper must at home be seen.
234,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Your's I've experienced, and that times not few,"
235,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,And it has forced me oft to flee from you.
236,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"When pride of wealth becomes our only God,"
237,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,We deal with others with an iron rod.
238,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Had you, when I in bus'ness spent the day,"
239,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Ta'en up some bills, or any debts then pay,"
240,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"I had done well; but you, to save your pelf,"
241,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Left me to grapple with the world myself.
242,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"For charities' sake, another way pursue,"
243,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"That, as I wish, I may speak well of you:"
244,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,To wretched son and wife your hand extend:
245,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,Fulfil your promise: then you'll be my friend.
246,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Give us for once but wherewithal to toil,"
247,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,And we'll with industry improve the soil:
248,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"Speak but your wish; I'll work on any plan,"
249,THE WRETCHED PAIR.,"And prove myself a grateful, honest man."
