100,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
101,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
102,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"James Beattie, the author of the ""Minstrel"" was born at Laurencekirk, in"
103,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,the county of Kincardineshire--a village situated in that beautiful
104,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"trough of land called the Howe of the Mearns, and surmounted by the"
105,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"ridge of the Garvock Hills, which divide it from the German Ocean--on"
106,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the 25th day of October 1735. His father, who was a small farmer and"
107,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"shopkeeper, and who is said to have possessed a turn for literature and"
108,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"versifying, died when James was only seven years old; but his brother"
109,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"David, the eldest of a family of six, undertook the superintendence of"
110,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,his education till he was fit to go to the parish school. That school
111,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which had been raised to celebrity by Thomas Ruddiman, the grammarian,"
112,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"was now taught by one Milne, whom his pupil describes as also a good"
113,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"grammarian and an excellent Latin scholar, but destitute of taste, and"
114,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,of all the other qualifications of a teacher. Milne preferred Ovid to
115,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Virgil; but Beattie's taste, already giving promise of its future"
116,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"classical bent, was attracted by the less meretricious beantics of"
117,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Virgil; and this author, in Dryden's translation, as well as Milton's"
118,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Paradise Lost,"" and Thomson's ""Seasons,"" were devoured with eagerness,"
119,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and copied with emulation, by him in the intervals of his school hours."
120,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"He was assisted in his studies by Mr Thomson, minister of the parish. In"
121,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"1749, when he reached the age of fourteen, he entered Marischal College,"
122,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Aberdeen, and such was his proficiency that he took by competition the"
123,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,first of those bursaries or exhibitions which are given to those
124,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,students who are unable to support the expenses of their own education.
125,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Aberdeen has been always distinguished by its eminent professors.
126,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Blackwell, Gerard, Reid, Campbell, the subject of this sketch, Brown,"
127,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Blackie, &c. are only a few of the celebrated names the roll of its two"
128,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,colleges contains. The two first-mentioned were flourishing at the time
129,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,when young Beattie entered the University. Blackwell was a learned but
130,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"pedantic Grecian, who wrote with considerable power and great pomp on"
131,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Mythology,"" ""Homer,"" and the ""Court of Augustus."" Alexander Gerard was"
132,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the author of some books of some merit, although now nearly forgotten,"
133,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"on the ""Genius of Christianity,"" on ""Taste and Genius,"" &c. Under both"
134,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,these Beattie profited very much. He gained a high prize in Blackwell's
135,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"class, for an analysis of the fourth book of the ""Odyssey."" He did not"
136,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"neglect general reading, nor the art of poetry. He spent much of his"
137,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"leisure in studying and practising music, which he always loved with a"
138,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"passion. We can conceive him, too, the ""lone enthusiast,"" repairing"
139,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"often to the resounding shore of the ocean, or leaning where a greater"
140,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"than he was by and by to lean, over the Brig of Balgounie, which bends"
141,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"above the deep, dark Don, or walking out pensively to the Bridge of Dee,"
142,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and watching the calm, translucent, yet strong, victorious river running"
143,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,through its rich green banks and clustering corn-fields to wed the sea.
144,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"No university in wide Britain can be named with Aberdeen, in point of"
145,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the wild romantic grandeur of its environs, if we include in these the"
146,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,upper courses of the two rivers which meet beside it and Byron Hall.
147,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Macintosh, as well as Beattie, have owned the inspiration which the"
148,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"scenery, still more than the scholastic training of the Northern"
149,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Metropolis, breathed into their opening minds."
150,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
151,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1753, having cultivated assiduously every branch of study taught at"
152,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"college except mathematics, for which he had neither taste nor aptitude,"
153,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Beattie took the degree of A.M. He had hitherto been supported by the
154,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"kindness of his brother David, but now he was to look out for a"
155,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,profession for himself. The situation of parish schoolmaster at Fordoun
156,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"falling vacant, he determined to apply for it; and on the 11th of August"
157,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,1753 he was elected to the office. Fordoun is situated a few miles to
158,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the north-east of Laurencekirk, and is surrounded by similar scenery. A"
159,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"series of gentlemen's seats extend, at brief intervals, from Brechin to"
160,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Stonehaven, along a ridge of bare and bold mountains, and overlooking a"
161,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"fair and rich plain, so that thus the neighbourhood of Fordoun includes"
162,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"a combination of the soft, the beautiful, the luxuriant, and the"
163,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"nakedly-sublime, which must have fed to satiety the eye and heart of"
164,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"this true poet. Otherwise, the situation could not be called eligible."
165,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"The salary was small, the society at that time indifferent, and the"
166,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"sphere limited. There were, however, some counter-balancing advantages."
167,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Near the village resided Lord Gardenstown, who met Beattie in a romantic"
168,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"glen near his house, with pencil and paper in his hand--entered into"
169,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,conversation with him--found out that he was a poet--and gave him the
170,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Invocation to Venus"" in the opening of Lucretius, to translate, which"
171,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"he did on the spot, and thus removed some doubts Lord Gardenstown had"
172,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"entertained as to whether his poetry was actually his own; and, besides,"
173,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Lord Monboddo, a remarkable man, alike in talent and eccentricity; and"
174,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,both vied with each other in their patronage of the poetical _dominie_
175,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,when he had undisturbed leisure for study and solitary communion with
176,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"nature. On the whole, perhaps, the future ""Minstrel"" was happier as a"
177,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,parish schoolmaster than in any part of his after life; and perhaps
178,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"often, in more brilliant but less easy days, would revert with a sigh to"
179,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,the simple school and the stream which murmurs past the small kirkyard
180,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,of Fordoun.
181,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
182,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"While there, he wrote a few poetical pieces, which he sent with his"
183,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"initials, and the name of his place of abode, to the _Scots Magazine_."
184,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"We can fancy him, like the immortal Peter Pattieson, on the day the"
185,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Magazine was due, walking as far as the little height of Auchcairnie, to"
186,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,watch and weary for the long-expected carrier's cart wending its slow
187,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"way from the south and, when the parcel reached his hand, with eager,"
188,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"trembling fingers, opening it up, to have all the joy of virgin"
189,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,authorship awakened in his soul. In these days a poetic production from
190,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the country seemed a phenomenon--as great, to use an expression of De"
191,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Quincey's, as if ""a dragoon horse had struck up 'Rule Britannia,'"" and"
192,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"no doubt, many an eyebrow in Auld Reekie rose in wonder, and many a"
193,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"voice exclaimed, ""Who can this be?"" when verses so good by J. B."
194,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Fordoun, flashed upon the public from time to time. But, although his"
195,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"poetry procured him more fame than he was then aware of, it brought him"
196,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"nothing more, and his way to competence and elevation in society, seemed"
197,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,as completely blocked up as ever.
198,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
199,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"It would seem that he had, from an early period of his life, looked"
200,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"forward to the Church as his profession; and, having taught for some"
201,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"time in Fordoun, he returned to Aberdeen, to prosecute those preparatory"
202,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,studies which he had for a while abandoned for a parish school and
203,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,poetry. Here he attended the lectures of Dr Robert Pollock of Marischal
204,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"College, and Professor John Lumsden of King's-and performed the"
205,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,exercises prescribed by both. It was at this time that he delivered a
206,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"discourse in the Divinity Hall in language so lofty, that the Professor"
207,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,challenged him for writing poetry instead of prose--a story reminding us
208,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of similar facts in the history of Thomson, Pollok, and others whose"
209,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"names we do not mention--and corroborating the truth, that poetical"
210,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"genius and the halls of philosophy or theology are seldom congenial, and"
211,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"that ""musty, fusty, crusty"" old professors are in general harsh"
212,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,stepfathers to rising poets.
213,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
214,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Whether from chagrin on account of this criticism--and this is the more
215,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"probable, because Beattie was all along very sensitive to depreciation"
216,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"or abuse--or from some other cause, he determined to abandon the study"
217,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of Divinity, and to follow teaching as a profession. In 1757, a vacancy"
218,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"occurring in the Grammar School of Aberdeen, Beattie offered himself as"
219,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"a candidate, but failed in the preliminary examination, as he had"
220,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"himself expected, from a want of circumstantial and minute acquaintance"
221,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"with the Latin tongue. A few months after, however, a second vacancy"
222,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"having taken place in the same school, he was elected without the form"
223,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of a trial, and entered on the discharge of his duties in June 1758. He"
224,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,was now in a more advantageous and a more reputable post--and while
225,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"discharging its duties with exemplary diligence, he found time for the"
226,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,cultivation of his poetical gift.
227,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
228,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1760, through the exertions of his friends, especially the Earl of"
229,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Erroll, and Mr Arbuthnott, Beattie was appointed Professor of Philosophy"
230,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,in Marischal College. It was thought at the time a startling experiment
231,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,to appoint a man so young--and who had given no proof of peculiar
232,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,proficiency in philosophical lore--to such an important chair; and was
233,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,no doubt stigmatised as one of those arrant 'jobs' by which the history
234,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of Scotch Colleges has been often disgraced. In Beattie's case, however,"
235,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"as well as in the kindred one of Professor Wilson, the issue was more"
236,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,fortunate than might have been expected. He set manfully to work to
237,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,supply his deficiencies--read and wrote hard--and in a few years had
238,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,prepared a very respectable course of lectures--and became able to
239,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"front, without shame, such men as Gerard and Gregory, Campbell and"
240,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Reid--with whom he was now associated. In the same year appeared, in a"
241,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"very modest manner, ""Proposals for Printing Original Poems and"
242,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Translations."" In 1761, the volume itself was published--consisting of"
243,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the pieces formerly printed in the 'Scots Magazine', corrected and"
244,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"altered, and of some new productions. The book appeared simultaneously"
245,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"in Edinburgh and London, and was hailed with universal applause; the"
246,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,critics generally maintaining that no poetry so good had been written
247,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,since Gray's; which they thought Beattie had taken for his model. He
248,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"himself entertained, after a while, a very different opinion of their"
249,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"merits; he was, in fact, seized with a fastidious loathing for them; he"
250,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,destroyed every copy he could procure; and on republishing his poetry
251,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"before his death, he acknowledged only four of these early effusions."
252,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
253,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1765, he published, in quarto, his ""Judgment of Paris,"" which met"
254,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,with the unfavourable reception it deserved. He added it to an edition
255,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,of his poems printed in 1766; but afterwards refused to reprint it. We
256,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"have given it, however, as well as all his original minor poems, in our"
257,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"edition, including a poem on Churchill, published by him in 1766, and"
258,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which, acrimonious and unjust as it is, is full of spirit, and shows"
259,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Beattie in the character of a ""good hater."""
260,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
261,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1763, he had visited London, where almost his only acquaintance was"
262,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Andrew Millar, the bookseller, and where nothing remarkable occurred"
263,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"except a visit to Pope's Villa at Twickenham. In 1765, he had been"
264,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"invited by the Earl of Strathmore to meet with Gray, then on a visit at"
265,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Glammis Castle. Lovelier spot, or more appropriate for the meeting of"
266,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"two poets, does not exist in broad Scotland than the Castle of Glammis,"
267,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"with its tall, vast, antique structure, towering over its ancient park,"
268,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,and shadowed by large ancestral trees--with its interior full of the
269,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"quiet memories, quaint paintings, and collected curiosities of a"
270,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,thousand years--with its chapel situated in the very groin of the
271,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"edifice, and in whose dim religious light you see walls surrounded, by"
272,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"some female hand of a past age, with curious pictures--and with its"
273,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"leaden roof, commanding a wide view over forest and lawn, village and"
274,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"stream, mountain, meadow, and all the glories which replenish the long,"
275,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"fair valley of Strathmore. Here the poets met, and spent two delightful"
276,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"days. Beattie was amazed at the taste, the judgment, and the extensive"
277,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"learning of Gray; and Gray, an older and a more fastidious man, was"
278,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"nevertheless delighted with Beattie's enthusiasm, bonhommie, and heart."
279,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
280,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1767, he married Mary, the daughter of Dr Dunn, rector of the Grammar"
281,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"School, Aberdeen. She was an amiable and lovely woman. Dr Johnson, when"
282,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"he saw her in London, along with her husband, seemed to think more"
283,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"highly of her than of him. He was not aware, however, of a fact which"
284,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,became afterwards distressingly apparent--that from her mother she
285,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"inherited a tendency to insanity, which broke out in capricious"
286,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"waywardness, some time before it culminated in madness. We know not but"
287,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"this may explain Dr Johnson's saying to Boswell--""Beattie,"" he said,"
288,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""when he came first to London, 'sunk upon' us that he was married,"""
289,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"'i.e.', tried to hide that he was married. Perhaps the reason of this"
290,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"remark, which so much offended Beattie himself, was, that, afraid of her"
291,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"capricious flightiness being misunderstood, he was at first reluctant to"
292,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"bring her into society. His letter to the contrary was we fear, written"
293,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"for a purpose, and in order to 'conceal' the truth."
294,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
295,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"And now came what Beattie and some of his friends--although not we, nor"
296,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,the literary world now generally--considered the grand epoch of his
297,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"life--the publication of his ""Essay on Truth."" He had for some time been"
298,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"alarmed at the progress of the sceptical philosophy, both at home and"
299,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"abroad, and had expressed that alarm to his friends in his"
300,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"correspondence. At last this fear awoke in him a Quixotic courage, and"
301,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"he sallied forth like the valiant Don, in search of all whom he knew or"
302,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,imagined to be the enemies of Truth--and like him made some considerable
303,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"mistakes, and showed more zeal than discretion. We may quote here some"
304,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"sensible sentences from one of his biographers.--""That his meaning was"
305,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"excellent, no one can doubt; whether he discovered the right remedy for"
306,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the harm which he was desirous of removing, is much more questionable."
307,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"To magnify any branch of human knowledge beyond its just importance, may"
308,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,indeed tend to weaken the force of religious faith; but many acute
309,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"metaphysicians have been good Christians, and before the question thus"
310,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"agitated can be set at rest, we must suppose a proficiency in those"
311,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"inquiries which he would proscribe as dangerous. After all, we can"
312,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,discover no more reason why sciolists in metaphysics should bring that
313,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"study into discredit, than that religion itself should be disparaged"
314,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"through the extravagance of fanaticism. To have met the subject fully,"
315,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"he ought to have shown, that not only those opinions he controverts are"
316,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"erroneous, but that all the systems of former metaphysicians were so"
317,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"likewise."" In truth, Beattie would have gained his purpose far better"
318,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,had he been able to have written another such satire against Hume and
319,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"his followers, as Swift's ""Battle of the Books,"" Butler's ""Elephant in"
320,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the Moon,"" or Voltaire's ""Micromegas."" Had he had sufficient wit and"
321,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"sufficient knowledge, the inconsistencies, absurdities, and endless"
322,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,quarrels of metaphysicians might have furnished an admirable field! But
323,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"wit was hardly one of his qualities, and his knowledge of these subjects"
324,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"was superficial. In fact, the gentle ""minstrel"" warring against"
325,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"philosophy, reminds us of a plain English scholar attacking the Talmud,"
326,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,or of one who had never crossed the 'Pons Asinorum' slandering the
327,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Fluxions of Newton.

329,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"The essay appeared in 1770, and became instantly popular, passed through"
330,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"five large editions in four years, and was translated into foreign"
331,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"tongues. Hume smiled at it in his sleeve, but attempted no answer."
332,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Burke, Johnson, and Warburton, who must have seen through its sounding"
333,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"shallowness, pardoned and praised it for its good intentions, and"
334,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"because its author, though a champion rather showy than strong, was on"
335,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the right side. Flushed by its success, Beattie, in 1771, revisited"
336,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"London, and obtained admission to the best literary circles--sate under"
337,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the ""peacock-hangings"" of Mrs Montague--visited Hagley Park, and became"
338,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,intimate with Lord Lyttelton--chatted cheerily with Boswell and
339,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Garrick--listened with wonder to the deep bow-wows of Johnson's
340,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"talk--and as he watched the rich alluvial, yet romantic mountain stream"
341,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of thought, knowledge, and imagery that flowed perpetually from the"
342,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"inspired lips of Burke, perhaps forgot Gray and Glammis Castle, and felt"
343,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""a greater is here."" These men, in their turn, seem all to have liked"
344,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Beattie, although the full 'quid pro quo' of praise came only from"
345,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Lord Lyttelton, who vowed that in him Thomson had come back from the"
346,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"shades, much purified and refined by his Elysian sojourn! Beattie, we"
347,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"fear, was a little spoiled by the flatteries he received from Lyttelton"
348,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,and that peculiar clique which circled round him; and hence his
349,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"prejudice in their favour, and the praise he reciprocates, are enormous."

358,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1773, he again visited London, and the climax of his renown seemed to"
359,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"be reached, when the University of Oxford gave him the degree of"
360,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,LL.D.--when three different times he refused the offer by bishops and
361,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"archbishops of promotion in the English Church--and when (oh, brave!) he"
362,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"was admitted to an interview with their Majesties, complimented on his"
363,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Essay on Truth"" by good old George III., who was much better qualified"
364,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"to judge of an essay on turnips, and gifted with a pension of £200"
365,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,a-year. About the same time he was urged to apply for the Professorship
366,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of Moral Philosophy in Edinburgh, which he declined to do, apparently"
367,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,from a terror at the thought of coming so near David Hume--a terror
368,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which strikes us as exceedingly ludicrous, when we recollect that, most"
369,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"pernicious as were Hume's principles, he was in private as harmless,"
370,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"good-natured, and ('Scottice') 'sonsy' a being as lived."
371,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
372,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"A few months after the ""Essay on Truth"" appeared, and while the echoes"
373,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of its fame were beginning to spread through the world, there had"
374,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"appeared a thin anonymous quarto, entitled the ""First Book of the"
375,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Minstrel."" It slid noiselessly as a star into the world's air. The"
376,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"critics, finding no name on the title page, were peculiarly severe, and"
377,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"peculiarly senseless, in their treatment of the unpretending volume,"
378,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which would have been crushed under their heavy strictures, had"
379,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"not--rare event in those days--the public chosen to judge for itself,"
380,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,and to fall in love with the beautiful poem. It consequently soon ran
381,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"through four editions, each edition containing some corrections and"
382,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"improvements; and in the year 1774 he published the second part, which,"
383,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"now that its author's name was known, was loudly praised by the Reviews,"
384,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"as well as by the general reader. He always meant to, but never did, add"
385,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,a third.

387,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"From the date of his refusal of promotion in the English Church, Beattie"
388,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"had made up his mind to remain in Aberdeen, which is a beautifully built"
389,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"town, and which teemed to him with old associations. He spent his"
390,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"winters in diligently instructing his class, and in summer was often"
391,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"found at Peterhead, a town situated on the most easterly promontory of"
392,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Scotland, and which was then noted for its medicinal waters. Beattie was"
393,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"troubled with a vertiginous complaint, which he found benefited by the"
394,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,use of the Peterhead Spa. He no doubt also admired and often visited the
395,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"noble sea scenery to the south of that town.--Slaines Castle, standing"
396,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"on its rock, sheer over the savage surge, and begirt by the perpetual"
397,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"clang of sea-fowl and roar of billows, and the famous Bullers of Buchan,"
398,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"where the sea has forced its way through the solid rock, leaving an arch"
399,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of triumph to commemorate the passage, and formed a huge round pot where"
400,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"its waters, in the time of storm, rage and fret and foam like a newly"
401,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,imprisoned maniac--a pot which Dr Johnson proposes to substitute for the
402,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Red Sea, in the future incarceration of demons."
403,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
404,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"In 1776, he published, by subscription, a new and splendid edition of"

407,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Composition,"" and by ""Remarks on the Utility of Classical Learning."""
408,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"This was followed, in 1783, by a volume of ""Dissertations on Memory and"
409,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Imagination, Dreaming,"" &c. In 1786 he published a little treatise on"
410,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the ""Christian Evidences,"" which he had shown to Bishop Porteous in"
411,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"London, two years before, and been recommended by him to give to the"
412,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"world. Beattie himself preferred it to all his writings, in ""closeness"
413,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of matter and style."" In 1790 and 1793, appeared two volumes on the"
414,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Elements of Moral Science,"" containing an abridgment of his lectures on"
415,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Moral Philosophy and Logic. He wrote also, in the ""Transactions"" of the"
416,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Royal Society, Edinburgh, a paper on the sixth book of the ""Æneid"", and"
417,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,contributed a few notes to an edition of Addison's works.

419,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,His wife long ere this had been separated from him by her malady. By her
420,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"he had two sons, James Hay, named after the Earl of Errol, and Montague,"
421,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,after the celebrated Mrs Montague. The history of both was hapless.
422,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"James Hay, who gave high literary promise, and was still more"
423,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"distinguished by his amiable disposition, after having been appointed to"
424,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"be his father's successor in the chair, died in 1790, at the age of"
425,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"twenty-two, of a consumption. Beattie felt the blow deeply, and"
426,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"published, soon after, the life and remains of the precocious youth. Our"
427,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,readers must all remember the exquisite story of his teaching him the
428,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,idea of a Creator by sowing his name in cresses in the garden. The loss
429,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of Montague, also a youth of much promise, by a rapid fever in 1796,"
430,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,completed the prostration of the poor father. It was the case of Burke
431,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"over again, but worse, inasmuch as Beattie, a weaker nature, was"
432,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"sometimes driven to seek oblivion in the cup, and as sometimes his"
433,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"reason reeled on its throne, and he went about the house asking where"
434,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"his son was, and whether he had or had not a son. He retired from all"
435,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"society--lost taste for his former pleasures, such as music, which he"
436,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"had once relished so keenly--was seized, in 1799, with a paralytic"
437,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"affection, which deprived him of speech--and languished on, ever and"
438,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"anon visited with new assaults of the same malady, till at last, on the"
439,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"18th of August 1803, the gifted, amiable, but most miserable ""Minstrel"""
440,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,breathed his last. He now lies beside his two dear sons in the
441,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"churchyard of St Nicholas, Aberdeen, a graceful Latin inscription from"
442,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,the pen of Dr James Gregory of Edinburgh distinguishing the stone which
443,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,covers his ashes.
444,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
445,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Beattie was of the middle size, of slouching gait, and common-place"
446,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"appearance, redeemed by two fine dark eyes, which, melancholy in repose,"
447,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,gleamed and glowed whenever he became animated in conversation. He had
448,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"warm affections, a tender, shrinking, sensitive disposition, was a kind"
449,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"parent, an attached friend, truly pious, and could be charged with no"
450,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"fault, save an irritability of temper, which grew upon him with his"
451,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"misfortunes and infirmities, and, latterly, that occasional excess to"
452,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which we have alluded, which sprung rather from dotage and wretchedness"
453,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"than from inclination, and in which he was far more to be pitied than"
454,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,blamed.
455,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
456,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Of his pretensions as a philosopher we shall say nothing, save that he"
457,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"has now no name, and is held rather to have struck at and all about"
458,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Hume, than to have smote him hip and thigh. His essays are exceedingly"
459,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"agreeable reading. Cowper relished no book so well, but they can"
460,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"scarcely be called either profound or brilliant. They soothe, but do not"
461,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"suggest--they tickle, but do not tell us anything new. It is as a poet"
462,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"that his name must survive, and the paean of reception which saluted him"
463,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"in his ""Essay on Truth,"" entering on stilts, should have been reserved"
464,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"entirely for the ""Minstrel,"" with the meek harp in his hand."
465,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
466,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Much has been said of the effect of fine scenery upon the development of
467,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"genius. And as this is the theme of one-half of the ""Minstrel,"" we must"
468,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,be permitted a few remarks on it. The finest scenery in the world
469,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"cannot, then, 'create' genius. A dunce, born in the Vale of Tempe, will"
470,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"remain a dunce still. And, on the other hand, a poet reared in St Giles"
471,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"or the Goosedubs will develop his poetic vein. The true influences, we"
472,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"suspect, of scenery on genius are the following:--1st, Where poetry lies"
473,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"deep and latent in a deep but silent nature, scenery will act like the"
474,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,rod of Moses on the rock in bringing forth the struggling waters--it
475,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"will prompt to imitation, and gradually supply language. 2d, Early"
476,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,familiarity with the beautiful aspects of nature will enable the youth
477,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,of genius to realize the descriptions of nature in the great poetic
478,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"masters, to test their truth, and imbibe their spirit, by comparing them"
479,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"day by day with their archetypes. He can stand on a snow-clad mountain,"
480,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"with Thomson's ""Winter"" in his hands. He can walk through a wood of"
481,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"pines, swinging in the tempest, and repeat Coleridge's ""Ode to"
482,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Schiller."" He can, lying on a twilight hill, with twilight mountains"
483,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"darkening into night around him, and twilight fields and rivers"
484,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"glimmering far below, and one cataract, touching the grand piano of the"
485,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"silence into melancholy music, turn round and see in the north-east the"
486,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"moon rising in that ""clouded majesty"" of which Milton had spoken long"
487,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"before. He can take the ""Lady of the Lake"" to the same summit, while"
488,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"afternoon, the everlasting autumn of the day, is shedding its thoughtful"
489,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and mellow lines over the landscape, and can see in it a counterpart of"
490,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the scene at the Trosachs--the woodlands, the mountains, the isle, the"
491,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"westland heaven--all, except the chase, the stag, and the stranger, and"
492,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"these the imagination can supply; or he can plunge into the moorlands,"
493,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and reaching, toward the close of a summer's day, some insulated peak,"
494,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"can see a storm of wild mountains between him and the west, dark and"
495,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"proud, like captives at the chariot-wheels of the sun, and smitten here"
496,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and there into reluctant splendour by his beams, and think of all the"
497,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,gorgeous descriptions of sunset and its momentary miracles to be found
498,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"in Scott, Byron, Wilson, Croly, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Coleridge; or"
499,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"he can from some mighty Ben look abroad over a country--Scotland, and"
500,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the sea below, the blue heaven above, till, in his enthusiasm, he might"
501,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"deem that he could lay his one hand on the mane of the ocean, and his"
502,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"other on the tresses of the sun, and feels for the first time the force"
503,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,of Beattie's own fine words--
504,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
505,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""All the dread magnificence of Heaven."""
506,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
507,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
508,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Again, scenery will help sometimes to settle a question with a young"
509,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"mind, whose intellectual and imaginative faculties are nearly equal,"
510,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,whether it shall turn permanently to philosophy or to poetry. Such
511,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,dilemmas or Hercules choices are not uncommon; and there is a period in
512,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"life when the sight of a mountain, or a sunset, or an autumn river, amid"
513,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"its yellow woods, can have more power than even a book, or the influence"
514,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"of an older mind, or a young love-passion, in deciding them. Again,"
515,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,early intimacy with fine scenery furnishes the poetic mind with an
516,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"exhaustless supply of images. These being sown in youth, sown broadcast,"
517,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and without any effort of the mind to receive or retain them, bear fruit"
518,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"for ever. It is a shower of morning manna, which no after fervours of"
519,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"noon, or chills of evening, are able to melt or freeze. Or, shall we say"
520,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the mind of the young, especially if gifted, is a daguerreotype plate of"
521,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the finest construction, and when surrounded by romantic or lovely"
522,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"scenes, it receives and preserves them to the last, and can reproduce"
523,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"them, too, in ever-varying forms, and perpetual succession? And hence,"
524,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"in fine, it follows, that the greatest poets have either been brought up"
525,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"in the country, or have early come in contact with a beautiful nature,"
526,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"as the names of Homer, Virgil, Shakspeare, Milton, Thomson, Burns,"
527,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Scott, Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron, Wilson, and Thomas Aird, abundantly"
528,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,prove.
529,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
530,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Beattie employs the greater part of his first Canto of the ""Minstrel"" in"
531,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,showing the influence of Nature on the dawning mind of a poet. And there
532,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"can be little doubt that it is the scenery of his own native region, and"
533,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the progress of his own mind, that he has described. ""The long, long"
534,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"vale withdrawn,"" is the Howe of the Mearns--the ""uplands"" whence he"
535,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"views it, are the hills of Garvock--the ""mountain grey,"" is the Grampian"
536,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"ridge to the north-west--the ""blue main"" is the German Ocean, expanding"
537,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"eastward--and the ""vale"" where the hermit is overheard pouring out his"
538,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"plaint, may not inaptly be figured by that portion of Glen Esk, which"
539,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"meets the all-beautiful Burn, and where ""rocks on rocks are piled by"

547,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""And oft the craggy cliff he loved to climb,"""
548,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
549,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the truth of which any one may attest by walking up, in the cloudy and"
550,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"dark day, the Cairn-a-Mount, a lofty knoll, across which a road leads to"
551,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Deeside, to the north of the poet's birthplace, and watching the sea of"
552,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"vapour boiling, shifting, sinking, rising, tumultuating at his feet."
553,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
554,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Gray used to contend that, the stanza beginning, ""O how canst thou"
555,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"renounce the boundless store?"" was absolute inspiration, but objected,"
556,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"we think erroneously, to one word in it as French--""the _garniture_ of"
557,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"fields,"" to which Cary very properly produces, in reply, the words from"
558,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"our common version of the Bible--""The Lord _garnished_ the heavens."" We"
559,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,have noticed a stronger objection to a line in this otherwise perfect
560,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,stanza. It is this--

562,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields."""
563,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
564,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Here is unquestionably a tautology, since to shield and to shelter"

566,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
567,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"The charm of the ""Minstrel"" greatly lies in its blending of the moral"
568,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"elements with the material imagery of the poem. The mind, the growth of"
569,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which he describes, is not forced into activity, or hatched prematurely"
570,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"by electric heat; it developes sweetly, gradually, and in finest harmony"
571,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,with the beautiful and the great around it--like a fir amidst the
572,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"plantations of Woodmyre, or a planetree on the far-seen heights of"
573,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Esslie. The second canto has beautiful passages, but is, on the whole,"
574,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,more vague and fantastic than the first. We regret exceedingly that
575,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Beattie never found leisure for writing a third canto, and leading"
576,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Edwin, whom he had brought to the threshold, within the sanctuary of"
577,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"song, and consecrating him the ""High Priest of the Nine,"" by baptizing"
578,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,him into the Christian faith. The poem is a dream as well as a
579,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,fragment--no poetic mind was perhaps ever so thoroughly insulated as
580,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"that of his hero--but the ""dream is one,"" it is consistent with itself,"
581,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,and is painted with trembling truth of touch and delicate tenderness of
582,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,feeling. We feel it to be destitute of profound suggestiveness and
583,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"massive thought, but its verse is solemnly dignified, its imagery is"
584,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"chastely grand, and a rich chiaroscuro rests like a tropical night upon"
585,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the whole. Besides the stanzas we have already alluded to, it has some"
586,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,of those brief touches which show the master's hand: such as--
587,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
588,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Some deem'd him wondrous wise, and some believed him mad;"""
589,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
590,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"or in his curse upon the Cock, the line--"
591,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
592,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""And ever in thy dreams the ruthless fox appear;"""
593,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
594,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"or the burst of description, how like the scene when the clouds suddenly"
595,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"disperse, and show us"
596,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
597,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""the evening star."
598,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"And from embattled clouds emerging slow,"
599,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,Cynthia came riding in her silver car:
600,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"And hoary mountain cliffs shone faintly from afar."""
601,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
602,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
603,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"His smaller poems possess many felicitous lines. The ""Ode to Peace"""
604,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"closes splendidly, and the ""Hermit"" is little inferior to Gray's"
605,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"""Elegy."" Its burden is the doctrine of the Resurrection, and it breathes"
606,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"a more evangelical spirit than Gray. It begins in gloom, but ends in"
607,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"glory--a glory reflected from the revealed truth of Scripture, which,"
608,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"once believed, seems then to the poet corroborated by those analogies of"
609,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,nature which had previously ministered despair instead of hope--such as
610,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"the monthly death and resurrection of the moon, and the nightly"
611,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,darkening and morning revelation of the beauties of the landscape. The
612,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"stanza commencing with ""'Tis night,"" may be called perfectly beautiful;"
613,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,and we shall not soon forget that Dr Thomas Brown never quoted it
614,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"without tears, and that he quoted it, in tones of deep and tremulous"
615,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"pathos, in the last lecture he ever delivered to his students."
616,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
617,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"On the whole, Beattie may be ranked beside, or near, Campbell, Collins,"
618,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Gray, and Akenside. Deficient in thought and passion, in creative power,"
619,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"and copious imagination, he is strong in sentiment, in mild tenderness,"
620,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,and in delicate description of nature. Whatever become of his Essay on
621,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Truth, or even of his less elaborate and more pleasing Essays on Music,"
622,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"Imagination, and Dreams, the world can never, at any stage of its"
623,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"advancement, forget to read and admire the ""Minstrel"" and the ""Hermit,"""
624,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,or to cherish the memory of their warm-hearted and sorely-tried author.
625,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,
626,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"We now bid the author of the ""Minstrel"" farewell! We love to think of"
627,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"him wandering in youth through the black plantations of firs, which"
628,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"border on his birthplace, or climbing grey Garvock Hill, and fixing his"
629,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"dark pensive eyes on the distant white sails, hovering like rare wings"
630,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"over the rounded blue-green German deep, or crossing those dreary moors"
631,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"which lie between Stonehaven and Aberdeen, a solitary pedestrian, in"
632,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"search of learning and distinction, in that noble old city--or teaching"
633,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"his son to ""consider the cresses of the garden 'how they grow,'"" and to"
634,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,find in them something worth a thousand homilies or elaborate arguments
635,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,for the being of a God--or taking his last look of the dead body of his
636,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"last son, Montague, and saying, ""Now I have done with the world."" He had"
637,THE LIFE AND POETRY OF JAMES BEATTIE.,"many of the powers, all the virtues, and scarcely one of the faults"

658,PREFACE.,
659,PREFACE.,"The design was, to trace the progress of a Poetical Genius, born in a"
660,PREFACE.,"rude age, from the first dawning of fancy and reason, till that period"
661,PREFACE.,at which he may be supposed capable of appearing in the world as a
662,PREFACE.,"MINSTREL, that is, as an itinerant poet and musician:--a character"
663,PREFACE.,"which, according to the notions of our forefathers, was not only"
664,PREFACE.,"respectable, but sacred."
665,PREFACE.,
666,PREFACE.,"I have endeavoured to imitate Spenser in the measure of his verse, and"
667,PREFACE.,"in the harmony, simplicity, and variety of his composition. Antique"
668,PREFACE.,"expressions I have avoided; admitting, however, some old words, where"
669,PREFACE.,they seemed to suit the subject: but I hope none will be found that are
670,PREFACE.,"now obsolete, or in any degree not intelligible to a reader of English"
671,PREFACE.,poetry.
672,PREFACE.,
673,PREFACE.,To those who may be disposed to ask what could induce me to write in so
674,PREFACE.,"difficult a measure, I can only answer, that it pleases my ear, and"
675,PREFACE.,"seems from its Gothic structure and original, to bear some relation to"
676,PREFACE.,the subject and spirit of the poem. It admits both simplicity and
677,PREFACE.,"magnificence of sound and of language, beyond any other stanza I am"
678,PREFACE.,"acquainted with. It allows the sententiousness of the couplet, as well"
679,PREFACE.,as the more complex modulation of blank verse. What some critics have
680,PREFACE.,"remarked, of its uniformity growing at last tiresome to the ear, will be"
681,PREFACE.,found to hold true only when the poetry is faulty in other respects.

696,VIRGIL,Ah! who can tell how hard it is to climb
697,VIRGIL,The steep where Fame's proud temple shines afar?
698,VIRGIL,Ah! who can tell how many a soul sublime
699,VIRGIL,"Has felt the influence of malignant star,"
700,VIRGIL,And waged with Fortune an eternal war--
701,VIRGIL,"Check'd by the scoff of Pride, by Envy's frown,"
702,VIRGIL,And Poverty's unconquerable bar--
703,VIRGIL,"In life's low vale remote has pined alone,"
704,VIRGIL,"Then dropp'd into the grave, unpitied and unknown?"
705,VIRGIL,
706,VIRGIL,
707,VIRGIL,2
708,VIRGIL,
709,VIRGIL,"And yet the languor of inglorious days,"
710,VIRGIL,Not equally oppressive is to all;
711,VIRGIL,"Him who ne'er listen'd to the voice of praise,"
712,VIRGIL,The silence of neglect can ne'er appal.
713,VIRGIL,"There are, who, deaf to mad Ambition's call,"
714,VIRGIL,Would shrink to hear the obstreperous trump of Fame;
715,VIRGIL,"Supremely blest, if to their portion fall"

721,VIRGIL,
722,VIRGIL,The rolls of fame I will not now explore;
723,VIRGIL,"Nor need I here describe, in learned lay,"
724,VIRGIL,"How forth the Minstrel fared in days of yore,"
725,VIRGIL,"Right glad of heart, though homely in array;"
726,VIRGIL,His waving locks and beard all hoary gray;
727,VIRGIL,"While from his bending shoulder, decent hung"
728,VIRGIL,"His harp, the sole companion of his way,"
729,VIRGIL,Which to the whistling wild responsive rung:
730,VIRGIL,And ever as he went some merry lay he sung.

734,VIRGIL,
735,VIRGIL,"Fret not thyself, thou glittering child of pride,"
736,VIRGIL,That a poor villager inspires my strain;
737,VIRGIL,With thee let Pageantry and Power abide:
738,VIRGIL,"The gentle Muses, haunt the sylvan reign;"
739,VIRGIL,Where through wild groves at eve the lonely swain
740,VIRGIL,"Enraptured roams, to gaze on Nature's charms:"

750,VIRGIL,"Rise, sons of harmony, and hail the morn,"
751,VIRGIL,While warbling larks on russet pinions float:
752,VIRGIL,"Or seek at noon the woodland scene remote,"
753,VIRGIL,Where the grey linnets carol from the hill.
754,VIRGIL,"Oh, let them ne'er, with artificial note,"
755,VIRGIL,"To please a tyrant, strain the little bill,"
756,VIRGIL,"But sing what Heaven inspires, and wander where they will!"

758,VIRGIL,
759,VIRGIL,6
760,VIRGIL,
761,VIRGIL,"Liberal, not lavish, is kind Nature's hand;"
762,VIRGIL,Nor was perfection made for man below;
763,VIRGIL,Yet all her schemes with nicest art are plann'd;
764,VIRGIL,"Good counteracting ill, and gladness woe."
765,VIRGIL,With gold and gems if Chilian mountains glow;
766,VIRGIL,If bleak and barren Scotia's hills arise;
767,VIRGIL,"There plague and poison, lust and rapine grow;"
768,VIRGIL,"Here, peaceful are the vales, and pure the skies,"

772,VIRGIL,7
773,VIRGIL,
774,VIRGIL,"Then grieve not, thou, to whom the indulgent Muse"

776,VIRGIL,"Nor blame the partial Fates, if they refuse"
777,VIRGIL,The Imperial banquet and the rich attire.
778,VIRGIL,"Know thine own worth, and reverence the lyre."
779,VIRGIL,Wilt thou debase the heart which God refined?
780,VIRGIL,"No; let thy heaven-taught soul to Heaven aspire,"
781,VIRGIL,"To fancy, freedom, harmony resign'd;"
782,VIRGIL,Ambition's grovelling crew for ever left behind.
783,VIRGIL,
784,VIRGIL,
785,VIRGIL,8
786,VIRGIL,
787,VIRGIL,Canst thou forego the pure ethereal soul
788,VIRGIL,"In each fine sense so exquisitely keen,"
789,VIRGIL,"On the dull couch of Luxury to loll,"
790,VIRGIL,"Stung with disease, and stupified with spleen;"
791,VIRGIL,"Fain to implore the aid of Flattery's screen,"
792,VIRGIL,Even from thyself thy loathsome heart to hide
793,VIRGIL,"(The mansion then no more of joy serene),"
794,VIRGIL,"Where fear, distrust, malevolence abide,"
795,VIRGIL,"And impotent desire, and disappointed pride?"
796,VIRGIL,
797,VIRGIL,
798,VIRGIL,9
799,VIRGIL,
800,VIRGIL,"Oh, how canst thou renounce the boundless store"
801,VIRGIL,Of charms which Nature to her votary yields?
802,VIRGIL,"The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,"
803,VIRGIL,"The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;"
804,VIRGIL,"All that the genial ray of morning gilds,"
805,VIRGIL,"And all that echoes to the song of even,"
806,VIRGIL,"All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields,"
807,VIRGIL,"And all the dread magnificence of heaven,"
808,VIRGIL,"Oh, how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven?"
809,VIRGIL,
810,VIRGIL,
811,VIRGIL,10
812,VIRGIL,
813,VIRGIL,"These charms shall work thy soul's eternal health,"
814,VIRGIL,"And love, and gentleness, and joy impart."
815,VIRGIL,"But these thou must renounce, if lust of wealth"
816,VIRGIL,E'er win its way to thy corrupted heart:
817,VIRGIL,"For, ah! it poisons like a scorpion's dart;"
818,VIRGIL,"Prompting the ungenerous wish, the selfish scheme,"
819,VIRGIL,"The stern resolve, unmoved by pity's smart,"
820,VIRGIL,"The troublous day, and long distressful dream."
821,VIRGIL,"Return, my roving Muse, resume thy purposed theme."
822,VIRGIL,
823,VIRGIL,
824,VIRGIL,11
825,VIRGIL,
826,VIRGIL,"There lived in Gothic days, as legends tell,"
827,VIRGIL,"A shepherd-swain, a man of low degree;"
828,VIRGIL,"Whose sires, perchance, in Fairyland might dwell,"
829,VIRGIL,"Sicilian groves, or vales of Arcady;"
830,VIRGIL,"But he, I ween, was of the north countrie; [1]"
831,VIRGIL,A nation famed for song and beauty's charms;
832,VIRGIL,"Zealous, yet modest; innocent, though free;"
833,VIRGIL,Patient of toil; serene amidst alarms;
834,VIRGIL,Inflexible in faith; invincible in arms.
835,VIRGIL,
836,VIRGIL,
837,VIRGIL,
838,VIRGIL,12
839,VIRGIL,
840,VIRGIL,"The shepherd swain of whom I mention made,"
841,VIRGIL,On Scotia's mountains fed his little flock;
842,VIRGIL,"The sickle, scythe, or plough he never sway'd:"
843,VIRGIL,An honest heart was almost all his stock;
844,VIRGIL,His drink the living water from the rock:
845,VIRGIL,"The milky dams supplied his board, and lent"
846,VIRGIL,Their kindly fleece to baffle winter's shock;
847,VIRGIL,"And he, though oft with dust and sweat besprent,"
848,VIRGIL,"Did guide and guard their wanderings, wheresoe'er they went."
849,VIRGIL,
850,VIRGIL,
851,VIRGIL,13
852,VIRGIL,
853,VIRGIL,"From labour, health, from health, contentment, springs;"
854,VIRGIL,Contentment opes the source of every joy.
855,VIRGIL,"He envied not, he never thought of kings;"
856,VIRGIL,"Nor from those appetites sustain'd annoy,"
857,VIRGIL,"That chance may frustrate, or indulgence cloy;"
858,VIRGIL,Nor Fate his calm and humble hopes beguiled;
859,VIRGIL,"He mourn'd no recreant friend, nor mistress coy,"
860,VIRGIL,"For on his vows the blameless Phoebe smiled,"
861,VIRGIL,"And her alone he loved, and loved her from a child."
862,VIRGIL,
863,VIRGIL,
864,VIRGIL,14
865,VIRGIL,
866,VIRGIL,"No jealousy their dawn of love o'ercast,"
867,VIRGIL,Nor blasted were their wedded days with strife;
868,VIRGIL,"Each season look'd delightful, as it pass'd,"
869,VIRGIL,"To the fond husband, and the faithful wife."
870,VIRGIL,Beyond the lowly vale of shepherd life
871,VIRGIL,They never roam'd: secure beneath the storm
872,VIRGIL,"Which in Ambition's lofty hand is rife,"
873,VIRGIL,Where peace and love are canker'd by the worm
874,VIRGIL,"Of pride, each bud of joy industrious to deform."
875,VIRGIL,
876,VIRGIL,
877,VIRGIL,15
878,VIRGIL,
879,VIRGIL,"The wight whose tale these artless lines unfold,"
880,VIRGIL,Was all the offspring of this humble pair:
881,VIRGIL,His birth no oracle or seer foretold;
882,VIRGIL,"No prodigy appear'd in earth or air,"
883,VIRGIL,Nor aught that might a strange event declare.
884,VIRGIL,You guess each circumstance of Edwin's birth;
885,VIRGIL,"The parent's transport, and the parent's care;"
886,VIRGIL,"The gossip's prayer for wealth, and wit, and worth;"
887,VIRGIL,And one long summer day of indolence and mirth.
888,VIRGIL,
889,VIRGIL,
890,VIRGIL,16
891,VIRGIL,
892,VIRGIL,And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy:
893,VIRGIL,Deep thought oft seem'd to fix his infant eye.
894,VIRGIL,"Dainties he heeded not, nor gaude, nor toy,"
895,VIRGIL,Save one short pipe of rudest minstrelsy:
896,VIRGIL,"Silent when glad; affectionate, though shy;"
897,VIRGIL,And now his look was most demurely sad;
898,VIRGIL,"And now he laugh'd aloud, yet none knew why."
899,VIRGIL,"The neighbours stared and sigh'd, yet bless'd the lad:"
900,VIRGIL,"Some deem'd him wondrous wise, and some believed him mad."
901,VIRGIL,
902,VIRGIL,
903,VIRGIL,17
904,VIRGIL,
905,VIRGIL,But why should I his childish feats display?
906,VIRGIL,"Concourse, and noise, and toil he ever fled;"
907,VIRGIL,Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray
908,VIRGIL,"Of squabbling imps; but to the forest sped,"
909,VIRGIL,"Or roam'd at large the lonely mountain's head,"
910,VIRGIL,"Or, where the maze of some bewilder'd stream"
911,VIRGIL,"To deep untrodden groves his footsteps led,"
912,VIRGIL,"There would he wander wild, till Phoebus' beam,"
913,VIRGIL,"Shot from the western cliff, released the weary team."
914,VIRGIL,
915,VIRGIL,
916,VIRGIL,18
917,VIRGIL,
918,VIRGIL,"The exploit of strength, dexterity, or speed,"
919,VIRGIL,To him nor vanity nor joy could bring.
920,VIRGIL,"His heart, from cruel sport estranged, would bleed"
921,VIRGIL,"To work the woe of any living thing,"
922,VIRGIL,"By trap, or net; by arrow, or by sling:"
923,VIRGIL,Those he detested; those he scorn'd to wield;
924,VIRGIL,"He wish'd to be the guardian, not the king,"
925,VIRGIL,"Tyrant far less, or traitor of the field."
926,VIRGIL,And sure the sylvan reign unbloody joy might yield.
927,VIRGIL,
928,VIRGIL,
929,VIRGIL,19
930,VIRGIL,
931,VIRGIL,"Lo! where the stripling, wrapt in wonder, roves"
932,VIRGIL,Beneath the precipice o'erhung with pine:
933,VIRGIL,"And sees, on high, amidst the encircling groves,"
934,VIRGIL,From cliff to cliff the foaming torrents shine:
935,VIRGIL,"While waters; woods, and winds in concert join,"
936,VIRGIL,And Echo swells the chorus to the skies.
937,VIRGIL,Would Edwin this majestic scene resign
938,VIRGIL,For aught the huntsman's puny craft supplies?
939,VIRGIL,Ah! no; he better knows great Nature's charms to prize.
940,VIRGIL,
941,VIRGIL,
942,VIRGIL,20
943,VIRGIL,
944,VIRGIL,"And oft he traced the uplands, to survey,"
945,VIRGIL,"When o'er the sky advanced the kindling dawn,"
946,VIRGIL,"The crimson cloud, blue main, and mountain gray,"
947,VIRGIL,"And lake, dim-gleaming on the smoky lawn:"
948,VIRGIL,"Far to the west the long long vale withdrawn,"
949,VIRGIL,Where twilight loves to linger for a while;
950,VIRGIL,"And now he faintly kens the bounding fawn,"
951,VIRGIL,And villager abroad at early toil.
952,VIRGIL,"But, lo! the Sun appears, and heaven, earth, ocean smile!"
953,VIRGIL,
954,VIRGIL,
955,VIRGIL,21
956,VIRGIL,
957,VIRGIL,"And oft the craggy cliff he loved to climb,"
958,VIRGIL,When all in mist the world below was lost.
959,VIRGIL,"What dreadful pleasure! there to stand sublime,"
960,VIRGIL,"Like shipwreck'd mariner on desert coast,"
961,VIRGIL,"And view the enormous waste of vapour, toss'd"
962,VIRGIL,"In billows, lengthening to the horizon round,"
963,VIRGIL,"Now scoop'd in gulfs, with mountains now emboss'd!"
964,VIRGIL,"And hear the voice of mirth and song rebound,"
965,VIRGIL,"Flocks, herds, and waterfalls, along the hoar profound!"
966,VIRGIL,
967,VIRGIL,
968,VIRGIL,22
969,VIRGIL,
970,VIRGIL,"In truth he was a strange and wayward wight,"
971,VIRGIL,"Fond of each gentle, and each dreadful scene."
972,VIRGIL,"In darkness, and in storm, he found delight:"
973,VIRGIL,Nor less than when on ocean-wave serene
974,VIRGIL,"The southern Sun diffused his dazzling sheen, [2]"
975,VIRGIL,Even sad vicissitude amused his soul:
976,VIRGIL,"And if a sigh would sometimes intervene,"
977,VIRGIL,"And down his cheek a tear of pity roll,"
978,VIRGIL,"A sigh, a tear, so sweet, he wish'd not to control."
979,VIRGIL,
980,VIRGIL,

983,VIRGIL,"""O ye wild groves! O where is now your bloom?"""
984,VIRGIL,(The Muse interprets thus his tender thought)
985,VIRGIL,"""Your flowers, your verdure and your balmy gloom,"
986,VIRGIL,Of late so grateful in the hour of drought?
987,VIRGIL,"Why do the birds, that song and rapture brought"
988,VIRGIL,"To all your bowers, their mansions now forsake?"
989,VIRGIL,Ah! why has fickle chance this ruin wrought?
990,VIRGIL,"For now the storm howls mournful through the brake,"
991,VIRGIL,And the dead foliage flies in many a shapeless flake.
992,VIRGIL,
993,VIRGIL,
994,VIRGIL,24
995,VIRGIL,
996,VIRGIL,"""Where now the rill, melodious, pure, and cool,"
997,VIRGIL,"And meads, with life and mirth and beauty crown'd?"
998,VIRGIL,"Ah! see, the unsightly slime and sluggish pool,"
999,VIRGIL,Have all the solitary vale imbrown'd;
1000,VIRGIL,"Fled each fair form, and mute each melting sound,"
1001,VIRGIL,The raven croaks forlorn on naked spray:
1002,VIRGIL,"And, hark! the river, bursting every mound,"
1003,VIRGIL,"Down the vale thunders, and with wasteful sway"
1004,VIRGIL,"Uproots the grove, and rolls the shatter'd rocks away."
1005,VIRGIL,
1006,VIRGIL,
1007,VIRGIL,25
1008,VIRGIL,
1009,VIRGIL,"""Yet such the destiny of all on earth!"
1010,VIRGIL,So flourishes and fades majestic Man.
1011,VIRGIL,"Fair is the bud his vernal morn brings forth,"
1012,VIRGIL,And fostering gales awhile the nursling fan.
1013,VIRGIL,"Oh, smile, ye heavens serene! ye mildews wan,"
1014,VIRGIL,"Ye blighting whirlwinds, spare his balmy prime,"
1015,VIRGIL,Nor lessen of his life the little span!
1016,VIRGIL,"Borne on the swift, though silent wings of Time,"
1017,VIRGIL,Old age comes on apace to ravage all the clime.
1018,VIRGIL,
1019,VIRGIL,
1020,VIRGIL,26
1021,VIRGIL,
1022,VIRGIL,"""And be it so. Let those deplore their doom,"
1023,VIRGIL,Whose hope still grovels in this dark sojourn:
1024,VIRGIL,"But lofty souls, who look beyond the tomb,"
1025,VIRGIL,"Can smile at Fate, and wonder how they mourn."
1026,VIRGIL,Shall Spring to these sad scenes no more return?
1027,VIRGIL,Is yonder wave the Sun's eternal bed?
1028,VIRGIL,"Soon shall the orient with new lustre burn,"
1029,VIRGIL,"And Spring shall soon her vital influence shed,"
1030,VIRGIL,"Again attune the grove, again adorn the mead."
1031,VIRGIL,
1032,VIRGIL,
1033,VIRGIL,27
1034,VIRGIL,
1035,VIRGIL,"""Shall I be left forgotten in the dust,"
1036,VIRGIL,"When Fate, relenting, lets the flower revive?"
1037,VIRGIL,"Shall Nature's voice, to man alone unjust,"
1038,VIRGIL,"Bid him, though doom'd to perish, hope to live?"
1039,VIRGIL,Is it for this fair Virtue oft must strive
1040,VIRGIL,"With disappointment, penury, and pain?"
1041,VIRGIL,"No! Heaven's immortal springs shall yet arrive,"
1042,VIRGIL,"And man's majestic beauty bloom again,"
1043,VIRGIL,"Bright through the eternal year of Love's triumphant reign."""
1044,VIRGIL,
1045,VIRGIL,
1046,VIRGIL,28
1047,VIRGIL,
1048,VIRGIL,This truth sublime his simple sire had taught:
1049,VIRGIL,"In sooth, 'twas almost all the shepherd knew."
1050,VIRGIL,"No subtle nor superfluous lore he sought,"
1051,VIRGIL,Nor ever wish'd his Edwin to pursue.
1052,VIRGIL,"""Let man's own sphere,"" said he, ""confine his view;"
1053,VIRGIL,"Be man's peculiar work his sole delight."""
1054,VIRGIL,"And much, and oft, he warn'd him to eschew"
1055,VIRGIL,"Falsehood and guile, and aye maintain the right,"
1056,VIRGIL,"By pleasure unseduced, unawed by lawless might."

1063,VIRGIL,"Forlorn, in this bleak wilderness below,"
1064,VIRGIL,"Ah! what were man, should Heaven refuse to hear!"
1065,VIRGIL,To others do (the law is not severe)
1066,VIRGIL,What to thyself thou wishest to be done.
1067,VIRGIL,"Forgive thy foes; and love thy parents dear,"
1068,VIRGIL,"And friends, and native land; nor those alone:"
1069,VIRGIL,"All human weal and woe learn thou to make thine own."""

1073,VIRGIL,
1074,VIRGIL,"See, in the rear of the warm sunny shower"
1075,VIRGIL,The visionary boy from shelter fly;
1076,VIRGIL,"For now the storm of summer rain is o'er,"
1077,VIRGIL,"And cool, and fresh, and fragrant is the sky."
1078,VIRGIL,"And, lo! in the dark east, expanded high,"
1079,VIRGIL,The rainbow brightens to the setting Sun!
1080,VIRGIL,"Fond fool, that deem'st the streaming glory nigh,"
1081,VIRGIL,How vain the chase thine ardour has begun!
1082,VIRGIL,"'Tis fled afar, ere half thy purposed race be run."
1083,VIRGIL,
1084,VIRGIL,
1085,VIRGIL,31
1086,VIRGIL,
1087,VIRGIL,"Yet couldst thou learn that thus it fares with age,"
1088,VIRGIL,"When pleasure, wealth, or power the bosom warm;"
1089,VIRGIL,"This baffled hope might tame thy manhood's rage,"
1090,VIRGIL,And disappointment of her sting disarm.
1091,VIRGIL,But why should foresight thy fond heart alarm?
1092,VIRGIL,Perish the lore that deadens young desire!
1093,VIRGIL,"Pursue, poor imp, the imaginary charm,"
1094,VIRGIL,"Indulge gay hope, and fancy's pleasing fire:"
1095,VIRGIL,Fancy and hope too soon shall of themselves expire.
1096,VIRGIL,
1097,VIRGIL,
1098,VIRGIL,32
1099,VIRGIL,
1100,VIRGIL,When the long-sounding curfew from afar
1101,VIRGIL,"Loaded with loud lament the lonely gale,"
1102,VIRGIL,"Young Edwin, lighted by the evening star,"
1103,VIRGIL,"Lingering and listening, wander'd down the vale."
1104,VIRGIL,"There would he dream of graves, and corses pale,"
1105,VIRGIL,"And ghosts that to the charnel-dungeon throng,"
1106,VIRGIL,"And drag a length of clanking chain, and wail,"
1107,VIRGIL,"Till silenced by the owl's terrific song,"
1108,VIRGIL,Or blast that shrieks by fits the shuddering aisles along.
1109,VIRGIL,
1110,VIRGIL,
1111,VIRGIL,33
1112,VIRGIL,
1113,VIRGIL,"Or, when the setting Moon, in crimson dyed,"
1114,VIRGIL,"Hung o'er the dark and melancholy deep,"
1115,VIRGIL,"To haunted stream, remote from man, he hied,"
1116,VIRGIL,Where fays of yore their revels wont to keep;
1117,VIRGIL,"And there let Fancy rove at large, till sleep"
1118,VIRGIL,A vision brought to his entrancèd sight.
1119,VIRGIL,"And first, a wildly murmuring wind 'gan creep"
1120,VIRGIL,"Shrill to his ringing ear; then tapers bright,"
1121,VIRGIL,"With instantaneous gleam, illumed the vault of night."
1122,VIRGIL,
1123,VIRGIL,
1124,VIRGIL,34
1125,VIRGIL,
1126,VIRGIL,Anon in view a portal's blazon'd arch
1127,VIRGIL,Arose; the trumpet bids the valves unfold;
1128,VIRGIL,"And forth a host of little warriors march,"
1129,VIRGIL,"Grasping the diamond lance, and targe of gold."
1130,VIRGIL,"Their look was gentle, their demeanour bold,"
1131,VIRGIL,"And green their helms, and green their silk attire;"
1132,VIRGIL,"And here and there, right venerably old,"
1133,VIRGIL,"The long-robed minstrels wake the warbling wire,"
1134,VIRGIL,And some with mellow breath the martial pipe inspire.
1135,VIRGIL,
1136,VIRGIL,
1137,VIRGIL,35
1138,VIRGIL,
1139,VIRGIL,"With merriment, and song, and timbrels clear,"
1140,VIRGIL,A troop of dames from myrtle bowers advance;
1141,VIRGIL,"The little warriors doff the targe and spear,"
1142,VIRGIL,And loud enlivening strains provoke the dance.
1143,VIRGIL,"They meet, they dart away, they wheel askance;"
1144,VIRGIL,"To right, to left, they thread the flying maze;"
1145,VIRGIL,"Now bound aloft with vigorous spring, then glance"
1146,VIRGIL,Rapid along: with many-colour'd rays
1147,VIRGIL,"Of tapers, gems, and gold, the echoing forests blaze."
1148,VIRGIL,
1149,VIRGIL,
1150,VIRGIL,36
1151,VIRGIL,
1152,VIRGIL,"The dream is fled. Proud harbinger of day,"
1153,VIRGIL,"Who scar'dst the vision with thy clarion shrill,"
1154,VIRGIL,Fell chanticleer; who oft hath reft away
1155,VIRGIL,"My fancied good, and brought substantial ill!"
1156,VIRGIL,"Oh, to thy cursed scream, discordant still,"
1157,VIRGIL,Let harmony aye shut her gentle ear:
1158,VIRGIL,"Thy boastful mirth let jealous rivals spill,"
1159,VIRGIL,"Insult thy crest, and glossy pinions tear,"
1160,VIRGIL,And ever in thy dreams the ruthless fox appear!
1161,VIRGIL,
1162,VIRGIL,
1163,VIRGIL,37
1164,VIRGIL,
1165,VIRGIL,"Forbear, my Muse. Let Love attune thy line."
1166,VIRGIL,Revoke the spell. Thine Edwin frets not so.
1167,VIRGIL,"For how should he at wicked chance repine,"
1168,VIRGIL,Who feels from every change amusement flow?
1169,VIRGIL,"Even now his eyes with smiles of rapture glow,"
1170,VIRGIL,"As on he wanders through the scenes of morn,"
1171,VIRGIL,"Where the fresh flowers in living lustre blow,"
1172,VIRGIL,"Where thousand pearls the dewy lawns adorn,"
1173,VIRGIL,A thousand notes of joy in every breeze are borne.
1174,VIRGIL,
1175,VIRGIL,
1176,VIRGIL,38
1177,VIRGIL,
1178,VIRGIL,But who the melodies of morn can tell?
1179,VIRGIL,The wild brook babbling down the mountain side;
1180,VIRGIL,The lowing herd; the sheepfold's simple bell;
1181,VIRGIL,The pipe of early shepherd dim descried
1182,VIRGIL,In the lone valley; echoing far and wide
1183,VIRGIL,The clamorous horn along the cliffs above;
1184,VIRGIL,The hollow murmur of the ocean-tide;
1185,VIRGIL,"The hum of bees, the linnet's lay of love,"
1186,VIRGIL,And the full choir that wakes the universal grove.
1187,VIRGIL,
1188,VIRGIL,
1189,VIRGIL,39
1190,VIRGIL,
1191,VIRGIL,The cottage curs at early pilgrim bark;
1192,VIRGIL,Crown'd with her pail the tripping milkmaid sings;
1193,VIRGIL,"The whistling ploughman stalks afield; and, hark!"
1194,VIRGIL,Down the rough slope the ponderous waggon rings;
1195,VIRGIL,Through rustling corn the hare astonish'd springs;
1196,VIRGIL,Slow tolls the village clock the drowsy hour;
1197,VIRGIL,The partridge bursts away on whirring wings;
1198,VIRGIL,"Deep mourns the turtle in sequester'd bower,"
1199,VIRGIL,And shrill lark carols clear from her aerial tour.
1200,VIRGIL,
1201,VIRGIL,
1202,VIRGIL,40
1203,VIRGIL,
1204,VIRGIL,"O Nature, how in every charm supreme!"
1205,VIRGIL,Whose votaries feast on raptures ever new!
1206,VIRGIL,"O for the voice and fire of seraphim,"
1207,VIRGIL,To sing thy glories with devotion due!
1208,VIRGIL,"Blest be the day I 'scaped the wrangling crew,"
1209,VIRGIL,"From Pyrrho's maze, and Epicurus' sty;"
1210,VIRGIL,"And held high converse with the godlike few,"
1211,VIRGIL,"Who to the enraptured heart, and ear, and eye,"
1212,VIRGIL,"Teach beauty, virtue, truth, and love, and melody."
1213,VIRGIL,
1214,VIRGIL,
1215,VIRGIL,41
1216,VIRGIL,
1217,VIRGIL,"Hence! ye, who snare and stupify the mind,"
1218,VIRGIL,"Sophists! of beauty, virtue, joy, the bane!"
1219,VIRGIL,"Greedy and fell, though impotent and blind,"
1220,VIRGIL,"Who spread your filthy nets in Truth's fair fane,"
1221,VIRGIL,And ever ply your venom'd fangs amain!
1222,VIRGIL,"Hence to dark Error's den, whose rankling slime"
1223,VIRGIL,First gave you form! Hence! lest the Muse should deign
1224,VIRGIL,"(Though loth on theme so mean to waste a rhyme),"
1225,VIRGIL,With vengeance to pursue your sacrilegious crime.
1226,VIRGIL,
1227,VIRGIL,
1228,VIRGIL,42
1229,VIRGIL,
1230,VIRGIL,"But hail, ye mighty masters of the lay,"
1231,VIRGIL,"Nature's true sons, the friends of man and truth!"
1232,VIRGIL,"Whose song, sublimely sweet, serenely gay,"
1233,VIRGIL,"Amused my childhood, and inform'd my youth."
1234,VIRGIL,"O let your spirit still my bosom soothe,"
1235,VIRGIL,"Inspire my dreams, and my wild wanderings guide;"
1236,VIRGIL,"Your voice each rugged path of life can smooth,"
1237,VIRGIL,"For well I know, wherever ye reside,"
1238,VIRGIL,"There harmony, and peace, and innocence abide."
1239,VIRGIL,
1240,VIRGIL,
1241,VIRGIL,43
1242,VIRGIL,
1243,VIRGIL,"Ah me! neglected on the lonesome plain,"
1244,VIRGIL,"As yet poor Edwin never knew your lore,"
1245,VIRGIL,"Save when against the winter's drenching rain,"
1246,VIRGIL,"And driving snow, the cottage shut the door."
1247,VIRGIL,"Then, as instructed by tradition hoar,"
1248,VIRGIL,"Her legend when the beldam 'gan impart,"
1249,VIRGIL,"Or chant the old heroic ditty o'er,"
1250,VIRGIL,Wonder and joy ran thrilling to his heart;
1251,VIRGIL,"Much he the tale admired, but more the tuneful art."
1252,VIRGIL,
1253,VIRGIL,
1254,VIRGIL,44
1255,VIRGIL,
1256,VIRGIL,Various and strange was the long-winded tale;
1257,VIRGIL,"And halls, and knights, and feats of arms display'd;"
1258,VIRGIL,"Or merry swains, who quaff the nut-brown ale,"
1259,VIRGIL,And sing enamour'd of the nut-brown maid;
1260,VIRGIL,The moonlight revel of the fairy glade;
1261,VIRGIL,"Or hags, that suckle an infernal brood,"
1262,VIRGIL,"And ply in caves the unutterable trade, [3]"
1263,VIRGIL,"'Midst fiends and spectres quench the Moon in blood,"
1264,VIRGIL,"Yell in the midnight storm, or ride the infuriate flood."
1265,VIRGIL,
1266,VIRGIL,
1267,VIRGIL,45
1268,VIRGIL,
1269,VIRGIL,"But when to horror his amazement rose,"
1270,VIRGIL,"A gentler strain the beldam would rehearse,"
1271,VIRGIL,"A tale of rural life, a tale of woes,"
1272,VIRGIL,"The orphan babes, and guardian uncle fierce."
1273,VIRGIL,O cruel! will no pang of pity pierce
1274,VIRGIL,"That heart, by lust of lucre sear'd to stone?"
1275,VIRGIL,"For sure, if  aught of virtue last, or verse,"
1276,VIRGIL,To latest times shall tender souls bemoan
1277,VIRGIL,Those hopeless orphan babes by thy fell arts undone.
1278,VIRGIL,
1279,VIRGIL,
1280,VIRGIL,46
1281,VIRGIL,
1282,VIRGIL,"Behold, with berries smear'd, with brambles torn, [4]"
1283,VIRGIL,"The babes, now famish'd, lay them down to die:"
1284,VIRGIL,"Amidst the howl of darksome woods forlorn,"
1285,VIRGIL,Folded in one another's arms they lie;
1286,VIRGIL,"Nor friend, nor stranger, hears their dying cry:"
1287,VIRGIL,"""For from the town the man returns no more."""
1288,VIRGIL,"But thou, who Heaven's just vengeance dar'st defy,"
1289,VIRGIL,"This deed with fruitless tears shalt soon deplore,"
1290,VIRGIL,"When Death lays waste thy house, and flames consume thy store."
1291,VIRGIL,
1292,VIRGIL,
1293,VIRGIL,47
1294,VIRGIL,
1295,VIRGIL,A stifled smile of stern vindictive joy
1296,VIRGIL,"Brighten'd one moment Edwin's starting tear,--"
1297,VIRGIL,"""But why should gold man's feeble mind decoy,"
1298,VIRGIL,"And innocence thus die by doom severe?"""
1299,VIRGIL,"O Edwin! while thy heart is yet sincere,"
1300,VIRGIL,The assaults of discontent and doubt repel:
1301,VIRGIL,Dark even at noontide is our mortal sphere;
1302,VIRGIL,But let us hope; to doubt is to rebel:
1303,VIRGIL,"Let us exult in hope, that all shall yet be well."
1304,VIRGIL,
1305,VIRGIL,
1306,VIRGIL,48
1307,VIRGIL,
1308,VIRGIL,"Nor be thy generous indignation check'd,"
1309,VIRGIL,Nor check'd the tender tear to Misery given;
1310,VIRGIL,"From Guilt's contagious power shall _that_ protect,"
1311,VIRGIL,_This_ soften and refine the soul for Heaven.
1312,VIRGIL,But dreadful is their doom whom doubt has driven
1313,VIRGIL,"To censure Fate, and pious Hope forego:"
1314,VIRGIL,"Like yonder blasted boughs by lightning riven,"
1315,VIRGIL,"Perfection, beauty, life, they never know,"
1316,VIRGIL,"But frown on all that pass, a monument of woe."
1317,VIRGIL,
1318,VIRGIL,
1319,VIRGIL,49
1320,VIRGIL,
1321,VIRGIL,"Shall he whose birth, maturity, and age"
1322,VIRGIL,"Scarce fill the circle of one summer day,"
1323,VIRGIL,"Shall the poor gnat, with discontent and rage,"
1324,VIRGIL,"Exclaim that Nature hastens to decay,"
1325,VIRGIL,"If but a cloud obstruct the solar ray,"
1326,VIRGIL,If but a momentary shower descend?
1327,VIRGIL,"Or shall frail man Heaven's dread decree gainsay,"
1328,VIRGIL,Which bade the series of events extend
1329,VIRGIL,"Wide through unnumber'd worlds, and ages without end?"
1330,VIRGIL,
1331,VIRGIL,
1332,VIRGIL,50
1333,VIRGIL,
1334,VIRGIL,"One part, one little part, we dimly scan"
1335,VIRGIL,Through the dark medium of life's feverish dream;
1336,VIRGIL,"Yet dare arraign the whole stupendous plan,"
1337,VIRGIL,If but that little part incongruous seem.
1338,VIRGIL,Nor is that part perhaps what mortals deem;
1339,VIRGIL,Oft from apparent ill our blessings rise.
1340,VIRGIL,"O, then, renounce that impious self-esteem,"
1341,VIRGIL,That aims to trace the secrets of the skies:
1342,VIRGIL,"For thou art but of dust; be humble, and be wise."
1343,VIRGIL,
1344,VIRGIL,
1345,VIRGIL,51
1346,VIRGIL,
1347,VIRGIL,Thus Heaven enlarged his soul in riper years.
1348,VIRGIL,"For Nature gave him strength and fire, to soar"
1349,VIRGIL,On Fancy's wing above this vale of tears;
1350,VIRGIL,"Where dark cold-hearted sceptics, creeping, pore"
1351,VIRGIL,Through microscope of metaphysic lore;
1352,VIRGIL,"And much they grope for Truth, but never hit."
1353,VIRGIL,"For why? Their powers, inadequate before,"
1354,VIRGIL,This idle art makes more and more unfit;
1355,VIRGIL,"Yet deem they darkness light, and their vain blunders wit."
1356,VIRGIL,
1357,VIRGIL,
1358,VIRGIL,52
1359,VIRGIL,
1360,VIRGIL,Nor was this ancient dame a foe to mirth.
1361,VIRGIL,"Her ballad, jest, and riddle's quaint device"
1362,VIRGIL,Oft cheer'd the shepherds round their social hearth;
1363,VIRGIL,Whom levity or spleen could ne'er entice
1364,VIRGIL,"To purchase chat or laughter, at the price"
1365,VIRGIL,"Of decency. Nor let it faith exceed,"
1366,VIRGIL,That Nature forms a rustic taste so nice.
1367,VIRGIL,"Ah! had they been of court or city breed,"
1368,VIRGIL,Such delicacy were right marvellous indeed.
1369,VIRGIL,
1370,VIRGIL,
1371,VIRGIL,53
1372,VIRGIL,
1373,VIRGIL,"Oft when the winter storm had ceased to rave,"
1374,VIRGIL,"He roam'd the snowy waste at even, to view"
1375,VIRGIL,"The cloud stupendous, from the Atlantic wave"
1376,VIRGIL,"High-towering, sail along the horizon blue;"
1377,VIRGIL,"Where, 'midst the changeful scenery, ever new,"
1378,VIRGIL,"Fancy a thousand wondrous forms descries,"
1379,VIRGIL,"More wildly great than ever pencil drew,"
1380,VIRGIL,"Rocks, torrents, gulfs, and shapes of giant size,"
1381,VIRGIL,"And glittering cliffs on cliffs, and fiery ramparts rise."
1382,VIRGIL,
1383,VIRGIL,
1384,VIRGIL,54
1385,VIRGIL,
1386,VIRGIL,"Thence musing onward to the sounding shore,"
1387,VIRGIL,"The lone enthusiast oft would take his way,"
1388,VIRGIL,"Listening, with pleasing dread, to the deep roar"
1389,VIRGIL,"Of the wide-weltering waves. In black array,"
1390,VIRGIL,"When sulphurous clouds roll'd on the autumnal day,"
1391,VIRGIL,"Even then he hasten'd from the haunt of man,"
1392,VIRGIL,"Along the trembling wilderness to stray,"
1393,VIRGIL,"What time the lightning's fierce career began,"
1394,VIRGIL,And o'er heaven's rending arch the rattling thunder ran.
1395,VIRGIL,
1396,VIRGIL,
1397,VIRGIL,55
1398,VIRGIL,
1399,VIRGIL,"Responsive to the lively pipe, when all"
1400,VIRGIL,"In sprightly dance the village youth were join'd,"
1401,VIRGIL,"Edwin, of melody aye held in thrall,"
1402,VIRGIL,"From the rude gambol far remote reclined,"
1403,VIRGIL,"Soothed with the soft notes warbling in the wind,"
1404,VIRGIL,"Ah! then all jollity seem'd noise and folly,"
1405,VIRGIL,To the pure soul by Fancy's fire refined;
1406,VIRGIL,"Ah! what is mirth but turbulence unholy,"
1407,VIRGIL,When with the charm compared of heavenly melancholy?
1408,VIRGIL,
1409,VIRGIL,
1410,VIRGIL,56
1411,VIRGIL,
1412,VIRGIL,Is there a heart that music cannot melt?
1413,VIRGIL,Alas! how is that rugged heart forlorn!
1414,VIRGIL,"Is there, who ne'er those mystic transports felt"
1415,VIRGIL,Of solitude and melancholy born?
1416,VIRGIL,He needs not woo the Muse; he is her scorn.
1417,VIRGIL,The sophist's rope of cobweb he shall twine;

1638,(HORAT.),And whisper comfort to the man of woes?
1639,(HORAT.),"Here Innocence may wander, safe from foes,"

1641,(HORAT.),"O Solitude! the man who thee foregoes,"

1664,(HORAT.),"Shrinks not, though Fortune aim her deadliest blow."""
1665,(HORAT.),This strain from 'midst the rocks was heard to flow

1667,(HORAT.),"And from embattled clouds emerging slow,"
1668,(HORAT.),Cynthia came riding on her silver car;

4854,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],
4855,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"If I had composed the following verses, with a view to gratify private"

4857,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"myself to the patronage of any person whatsoever, I should have been"
4858,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],altogether inexcusable. To attack the memory of the dead from selfish
4859,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"considerations, or from mere wantonness of malice, is an enormity which"
4860,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],none can hold in greater detestation than I. But I composed them from
4861,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"very different motives; as every intelligent reader, who peruses them"
4862,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"with attention, and who is willing to believe me upon my own testimony,"
4863,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],will undoubtedly perceive. My motives proceeded from a sincere desire to
4864,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"do some small service to my country, and to the cause of truth and"
4865,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"virtue. The promoters of faction I ever did, and ever will, consider as"
4866,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],the enemies of mankind: to the memory of such I owe no veneration: to
4867,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],the writings of such I owe no indulgence.
4868,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],
4869,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],Your Lordship knows that (Churchill) owed the greatest share of his

4872,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"the vilest of all human passions, hatred to their fellow-citizens. Those"
4873,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],who joined the cry in his favour seemed to me to be swayed rather by
4874,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],fashion than by real sentiment: he therefore might have lived and died
4875,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"unmolested by me, confident as I am, that posterity, when the present"
4876,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"unhappy dissensions are forgotten, will do ample justice to his real"

4878,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"memory, and heard that a monument in Westminster Abbey was intended for"
4879,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],one whom even his admirers acknowledge to have been an incendiary and a

4881,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"little on what they were doing, before they consecrated, by what"
4882,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"posterity would think the public voice, a character, which no friend to"
4883,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"virtue or true taste can approve. It was this sentiment, enforced by the"
4884,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"earnest request of a friend, which produced the following little poem;"
4885,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],in which I have said nothing of (Churchill's) manners that is not
4886,[PART OF A LETTER TO A PERSON OF QUALITY.],"warranted by the best authority: nor of his writings, that is not"

5895,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"The paradox of Dr Johnson, in reference to sacred poetry, has long ago"
5896,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"fallen into disrepute. It seems singular indeed, how it ever obtained"
5897,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"credence, even although supported by one of the most powerful pens that"
5898,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"ever wrote in Britain, when we remember that, previous to that author's"
5899,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"day, the best poetry in the world 'had' been sacred. The Holy Scriptures"
5900,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"then existed, with that poetry which bursts out at their every pore,"
5901,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"besides being collected here and there into masses of rich song,"
5902,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""pressed down, shaken together, and running over."" Dante, too, had"
5903,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"written his great work, which, as if to mark it out for ever from things"
5904,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"unclean and common, he had called the ""'Divina' Commedia,"" and which was"
5905,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"worthy of the name. Tasso's ""Gerusalemme Liberata"" had a religious"
5906,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"moral, as well as a title suggestive of religious ideas. Spenser's"
5907,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Faery Queen"" was sacred, if not in all the parts, yet at least in the"
5908,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"pervading spirit of its poetry. Cowley's ""Davideis,"" Herbert's ""Temple,"""
5909,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" and ""Paradise Regained,"" and Young's ""Night"
5910,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Thoughts,"" existed then, were all admitted to be more or less"
5911,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"masterpieces, and were all sacred in their subjects and aims. Blair's"
5912,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Grave"" too, had, ere Johnson's day, appeared, and furnished a good"

5914,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,power.
5915,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
5916,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"We need not say what a flood of sacred song has arisen since, and"
5917,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"drowned the dictum of the lexicographer in the waves. Nay, an opinion is"
5918,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"gaining ground, that all lofty poetry tends toward the sacred, and lies"
5919,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"under the shadow of the divine. Poetry is like fire, which, even when"
5920,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"employed in culinary or destructive purposes, points its column upwards,"
5921,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,and seems to transmit the flower and essence of its conquests to heaven.
5922,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"All poetry that does not thus ascend is either morbid in spirit, or"

5926,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"We come now to the life of one of our best religious poets,--ROBERT"
5927,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"BLAIR--whose short poem ""The Grave,"" is so admirable as to excite keen"
5928,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,regret that it is almost the only specimen extant of his gifted and
5929,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,original mind.
5930,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
5931,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"The facts of his life are more than usually scanty, and our biography,"
5932,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"therefore, must be brief and meagre. Robert Blair was born in Edinburgh,"
5933,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"in 1699. It is curious, by the way, how few poets the Modern Athens has"
5934,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"produced. It has bred lawyers, statists, critics, savans, in plenty, but"
5935,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"reared but few men of transcendant genius, and, so far as we remember,"
5936,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"only five good poets,--Scott, Ferguson, Ramsay, Falconer, and"
5937,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Blair,--whom the manufacturing town of Paisley nearly matches with its"
5938,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Tannahill, Motherwell, Alexander and John Wilson. Blair was the eldest"
5939,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"son of the Rev. David Blair, who was a minister of the Old Church of"
5940,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Edinburgh, and one of the chaplains to the King. His mother was Euphemia"
5941,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Nisbet, daughter of Alexander Nisbet, Esq., of Carfin. His grandfather,"
5942,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Robert Blair, of Irvine,--descended from the ancient family of Blair 'of"
5943,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"that ilk ('i.e.', of Blair), in Ayrshire,--distinguished himself, in the"
5944,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"troublous times of the Solemn League and Covenant, as a powerful"
5945,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"preacher, an able negociator, and a brave, determined man. The"
5946,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"celebrated Hugh Blair,--whose writings, once so popular, seem now nearly"
5947,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"forgotten,--was our poet's cousin, although younger by nineteen years."
5948,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Robert lost his father while yet a boy, but enjoyed the anxious care and"
5949,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,admirable training of an excellent mother. He studied first at the
5950,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"University of Edinburgh, and afterwards in Holland. Of the particulars"
5951,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,of either part of his curriculum nothing is known. On his return from
5952,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"abroad, he seems to have received license to preach, and to have hung"
5953,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"about Edinburgh for a few years, an unemployed probationer. This was of"
5954,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"less consequence, as he had some hereditary property. It gave him, too,"
5955,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"abundant leisure for study, and he employed it well--cultivating natural"
5956,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"history and the cognate sciences--publishing a few fugitive verses,"
5957,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,which made very little impression on the public--and drawing out the
5958,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,first rude draught of the poem which was destined to make him
5959,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"immortal,--""The Grave."" In 1731, when he was in his thirty-second year,"
5960,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"he was appointed to the living of Athelstaneford, a parish in East"
5961,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Lothian, where he continued to reside all the rest of his life."
5962,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Dissenter though the author of this biography be, he is free to confess,"
5963,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,that there is very much that is enviable in the position of a parish
5964,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"minister, particularly in the country. Possessed of an easy competence,"
5965,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"and a manageable field of labour, surrounded by the simplicities of"
5966,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"rural manners, and the picturesque features of rural scenery,--lord of"
5967,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"his sphere of duty, and master of his time,--his life can be, and often"
5968,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"is, one of the most useful and happy, honourable in its toils, and"
5969,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"graceful in its relaxations, to be found on earth. Where could we expect"
5970,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"elegant studies to be prosecuted with more success, or whence could we"
5971,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"expect more works of sanctified learning and genius to issue, than in"
5972,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"and from the ""manses"" of Scotland, always so beautifully situated, now"
5973,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"on the brink of the mountain stream, singing its wild way through the"
5974,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"woods,--now in the centre of rich orchards and fertile fields,--now on"
5975,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"sunny braes, overlooking the whole parish, prostrate in its loveliness"
5976,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"at their feet,--and now surrounded and shadowed by broad old oaks and"
5977,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"tall black pine-trees? And so, accordingly, it has been, although not"
5978,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,perhaps to the extent we might have wished or expected. Philosophy of
5979,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,the deepest order has been studied--inquiries the most profound and
5980,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,extensive into natural science and history have been prosecuted; and
5981,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"painting, music, and poetry, have found enthusiastic and gifted"
5982,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"votaries, who, at the same time, have not neglected their higher"
5983,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"vocation,--in the quiet manses of our country; and we rejoice to know"
5984,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"that this state of things continues, and is not confined to the"
5985,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Established Church, but may be asserted with equal or greater force to"
5986,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,exist in others.
5987,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
5988,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"At Athelstaneford, Blair seems to have realised this ideal of a country"
5989,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"minister. He was attentive to his pastoral duties, and the correspondent"
5990,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"of Doddridge and the author of ""The Grave,"" could not fail to be an"
5991,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"evangelical, a practical, and a powerful preacher. He at the same time"
5992,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"diligently prosecuted his favourite studies, which were botany, natural"
5993,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"history, and poetry. Possessing a considerable fortune, he lived on a"
5994,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"footing of equality and friendship with the gentry of the neighbourhood,"
5995,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,and others of similar rank in distant parts of Scotland. Sir Francis
5996,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,Kinloch of Gilmerton and John Gallander of Craigforth are mentioned as
5997,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"two of his intimates. We are tempted to figure the author of ""The Grave"""
5998,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,as a morose and melancholy 'solitaire'--musing amid midnight
5999,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"churchyards--stumbling over bones--and returning home to light his lamp,"
6000,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"inserted in a gaping skull, and to write out his gloomy cogitations."
6001,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,This is very far from being his real character. He was more frequently
6002,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"seen wandering amidst the flowery nooks of summer, with a microscope in"
6003,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"his hand; or, on his way home from his pastoral visitations, stopping to"
6004,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,analyse the fungi and the mosses which met him on his path; or musing
6005,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"above the long liquid lapse of some wayside stream, down which were"
6006,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,floating the red leaves of autumn; or turning a telescope of his own
6007,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,construction aloft to the gleaming host of heaven. In his mode of
6008,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"spending his time, as well as in some of the stern features of his"
6009,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"genius, he resembled Crabbe, who, believing that every weed was a"
6010,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"flower, spent much of his time amidst the fields and on the sea-shores;"
6011,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"who extracted delight out of the meanest fungus, even as he extracted"
6012,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"poetry out of the humblest characters; and whose life, like Blair's, was"
6013,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,a harmless dream.
6014,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6015,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"After spending seven years of studious solitude, he, in 1738, married"
6016,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"his relation, Isabella Law, daughter of Mr Law of Elvingston, who had"
6017,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"been professor of moral philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, and"
6018,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"whose death, which had happened ten years before, he had mourned in some"
6019,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"rather lame verses, which our readers will find in this edition. Her"
6020,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,brother was the sheriff-depute of East Lothian. She is described as a
6021,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"lady of great beauty and amiable manners, and succeeded in making the"
6022,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"poet very happy. She bore him five sons and one daughter. Of these,"
6023,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Robert arose, through various gradations of honour at the Scottish bar,"
6024,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"to be President of the Court of Session, and died in 1811. He was a man"
6025,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"of massive and powerful intellect. It is, we think, in 'Peter's"
6026,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,Letters' that Lockhart gives a glowing portraiture of President
6027,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Blair's remarkable powers. He had not the genius or ""hairbrained"
6028,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"sentimental trace"" of his father, but had inherited that clear, stern"
6029,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"understanding, and that profound insight into men and manners, which are"
6030,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"met with in every page of ""The Grave."""
6031,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6032,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Of this poem the author had, we said, drawn a first outline when a youth"
6033,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,in Edinburgh. This he completed after his settlement at Athelstaneford;
6034,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"and, about the year 1742, he began to make arrangements for its"
6035,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"publication. He had, probably through his neighbour, the celebrated"
6036,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Colonel Gardiner, who fell at the battle of Prestonpans, become"
6037,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"acquainted with Isaac Watts, who paid him, he says in one of his"
6038,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"letters, ""many civilities."" To him he forwarded the MS. of his poem. Dr"
6039,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Watts, with characteristic candour and good taste, admired it, and"
6040,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"offered it to two different London booksellers, both of whom, however,"
6041,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"declined to publish it, expressing a doubt whether any person living"
6042,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,three hundred miles from town could write so as to be acceptable to the
6043,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,fashionable and the polite! No poetry at that time went down except
6044,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"imitations of Pope. Blair got back his MS., and, nothing daunted, sent"
6045,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"it to Philip Doddridge, who was also an intimate of Colonel Gardiner's,"
6046,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"requesting his opinion, which appears to have been as favourable as that"
6047,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"of Dr Watts. At length it was published in London in the year 1743, and"
6048,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"reprinted at Edinburgh in 1747, a year after its author's death."
6049,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6050,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Between that event and the appearance of his poem, nothing remarkable"
6051,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,occurred. The success of his work must have shed additional sweetness
6052,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"into a cup which was rich before. ""His tastes,"" says one of his"
6053,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"biographers, ""were elegant and domestic. Books and flowers seem to have"
6054,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,been the only rivals in his thoughts. His rambles were from his fireside
6055,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"to his garden; and, although the only record of his genius is of a"
6056,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"gloomy character, it is evident that his habits and life contributed to"
6057,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"render him cheerful and happy."" At last that awful chasm, the terrors,"
6058,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"grandeurs, and moral lessons of which he had so powerfully sung, opened"
6059,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"its jaws to receive him, and the Grave crowned its laureate with its"
6060,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"cold and earthy crown. He was seized with fever, caught probably in the"
6061,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"exercise of his pastoral functions, and expired on the 4th of February"
6062,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"1746, at the early age of forty-seven, when his body and mind were both"
6063,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"in full vigour, and when, speaking after the manner of men, yet greater"
6064,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"works than ""The Grave"" were before him. He left his wife, who lived till"
6065,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"1774, and five children behind him. His body reposes in the church-yard"
6066,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"of Athelstaneford, without a monument, and with nothing but the initials"
6067,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,K.B. to mark the spot.
6068,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6069,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"The fact that he died comparatively so young, sufficiently accounts for"
6070,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,the paucity of his poems. He had found a vein of rich and virgin gold;
6071,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"he had thrown out one mass of ore, and was, as it were, resting on his"
6072,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"pickaxe ere recommencing his labour, when he was smitten down by a"
6073,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,workman who never rests nor slumbers. Still let us thankfully accept
6074,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"what he has produced; the more as it is so distinctively original, so"
6075,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"free from any serious alloy, and so impressively religious in its spirit"
6076,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,and tone.
6077,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6078,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,This masterpiece of Blair's genius is not a great poem so much as it is
6079,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"a magnificent portion, fragment, or book of a great poem. The most,"
6080,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"alike of its merits and its faults, spring from the fact, that it keeps"
6081,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,close to its subject--it daguerreotypes its dreadful theme. Many have
6082,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"objected to its conclusion as lame and impotent, and would have wished a"
6083,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,loftier swell of hopeful anticipation of the Resurrection at the close;
6084,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"but this, in fact, would have started the subject of another poem. Blair"
6085,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"was writing of the power and triumphs of the tomb. He left it to others,"
6086,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"or possibly to another poem by himself, to celebrate the victory over"
6087,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"it, to be gained at the resurrection. Enough for his purpose to allude"
6088,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"to it at the close, in such a way as to intimate his own belief in its"
6089,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"reality. Surely he expects too much who requires the painter of ""Night"""
6090,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"to introduce ""Morning"" into the same picture."
6091,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6092,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"The shortness of the poem has been objected to it. But this, we think,"
6093,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,shows the poet's good sense. The subject is too uniform and too gloomy
6094,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"for a long poem. ""The Grave, in twelve books"" would have been totally"
6095,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"unreadable. It was far better to give, as Blair has given, a strong,"
6096,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"stern, rapid, and concentrated sketch of the grisly gulf. The grave, in"
6097,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"one respect, has no unity, and no story. It stands by itself, hollow,"
6098,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"solitary, with its momentary ghastly yawnings, its general repose, and"
6099,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"the dark mysteries which, whether open or shut, it conceals in its"
6100,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"silent bosom. Reverence, as well as good taste, requires the poet who"
6101,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"would venture on such a theme, to approach it trembling, and to withdraw"
6102,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,from it in haste.
6103,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6104,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,Yet Blair has been accused of a want of reverence in his treatment of
6105,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"this awful subject, nor is this objection altogether unfounded; the poet"
6106,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"does treat ""the Grave"" in a somewhat abrupt and cavalier fashion, and"
6107,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,does not seem sufficiently afraid of it. He was young when he wrote the
6108,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"greater part of the poem, and of young poets we may ask as Wordsworth"
6109,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"asks about little children, ""What can they know of death?"" It had never"
6110,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"knocked at his door or glared in at his window. He was, besides, of a"
6111,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,bold and daring genius. He consulted rather strong effect than minute
6112,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"finish. The tone and style of his poem, consequently, are somewhat"
6113,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"hirsute and unpolished. Campbell says of him, judiciously, ""Blair may be"
6114,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,a homely and even a gloomy poet in the eye of fastidious criticism; but
6115,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,there is a masculine and pronounced character even in his gloom and
6116,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,homeliness that keeps it most distinctly apart from either dulness or
6117,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,vulgarity. His style pleases us like the powerful expression of a
6118,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"countenance without regular beauty."" He excels most in describing the"
6119,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"darkest and most terrible ideas suggested by the subject, and seems"
6120,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"almost to exult, while depicting the triumphs of the grave over the"
6121,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"rich, the strong, the lofty, and the powerful. Death himself he assails"
6122,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"in language approaching virulence, as when he says"
6123,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6124,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6125,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"O great maneater,"
6126,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Unheard-of epicure, without a fellow,"
6127,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Thou must render up thy dead,"
6128,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,And with high interest too.
6129,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6130,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6131,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"This exulting spirit, however, springs in him, less from ferocious"
6132,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"feeling than from conscious rejoicing power. He is not a savage,"
6133,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"brandishing his bloody tomahawk, so much as a Michael Angelo, hewing,"
6134,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"with heat and haste, at one of his terrible pieces of statuary. He"
6135,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,characterizes the miser severely; he lashes the proud wicked man whom he
6136,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,sees pompously hearsed into Hell; with stern irony he pursues the beauty
6137,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,from her looking-glass to the clods where
6138,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6139,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6140,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""The high-fed worm, in lazy volumes roll'd,"
6141,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Feeds on her damask cheek;"""
6142,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6143,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6144,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"he derides the baffled son of Æsculapius, who is deserted and deceived"
6145,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,by his own drugs; and he exerts all the fearful force of his genius to
6146,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"show us the suicide in that ""Other Place,"" where"
6147,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6148,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6149,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""The common damn'd shun his society,"
6150,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"And look upon themselves as fiends less foul."""
6151,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6152,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6153,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,But the fine imagery and the rapid touch serve alike to show that though
6154,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"he is angry, it is with the wrath of a man--not with the malignity of a"
6155,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"demon. We have sometimes been induced to fancy that Pollok, in the"
6156,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Course of Time,"" loves to linger amid the ruins of fallen and lost"
6157,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,natures; and finds a savage luxury in the contemplation of the agonies
6158,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,of those whom he represents as damned. He tells us that he loved no
6159,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"scenery so well as that of solitary wastes, where nature was utterly"
6160,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,barren and seemed willing to decay--where the dark wings of monotonous
6161,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,gloom and eternal silence met and sullenly embraced over the dreary
6162,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,region; and he seems to have had the same passion for moral as for
6163,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"physical desolations. Blair, on the other hand, never tarries long in"
6164,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"such scenes; he does not dwell amidst, and brood over them like an owl,"
6165,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,but crosses them with the swift brushing wing of a bird returning to her
6166,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,evening nest. He never goes out of his way to search for them--he sees
6167,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,and shows them merely because they meet him on his path. There is
6168,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,nothing morbid nor much that is melancholy in this poem. He takes the
6169,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"hard fact as it is, and paints it with all his force, but he does not"
6170,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"seek to exaggerate or discolour it. He shows ""the Grave"" in various"
6171,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"lights, at morning, night, and noon--not under the uniform weight of a"
6172,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"leaden midnight sky, or only by the ghastly illumination of a waning"
6173,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,moon.
6174,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6175,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Southey, in his ""Life of Cowper,"" has fallen into the mistake of"
6176,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"supposing Blair one of the imitators of Young. Now, in fact, Blair's"
6177,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"poem was 'written' before the ""Last Day"" of Young, or the ""Night"
6178,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Thoughts"" had appeared. Its originality is indeed one of its greatest"
6179,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"merits and charms. The author has copied no style, imitated no manner,"
6180,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,and scorned to permit any living man or poet to stand between him and
6181,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"the cold stern reality of death, which he was to reflect in song. He is"
6182,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"worthy, thus, of the name so often misapplied, of Poet--'i.e.' Maker."
6183,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,You see an original genius both in the beauties and the faults of the
6184,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"work. Its language, so simply strong and daring in its homeliness, its"
6185,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"free and energetic motion, its fresh fearless touch, its fidelity to"
6186,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"nature and to life, the quick succession and sharp brief poignancy of"
6187,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"its pictures, its absence of elaboration, and carelessness about minute"
6188,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"lights and shades--all combine to prove that the author has an eye, an"
6189,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"imagination, and a purpose quite peculiar to himself. He treats ""the"
6190,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Grave"" with as much originality as if he had been contemporary with the"
6191,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,earliest sepulchre--as if he had plucked grass from Abel's tomb; and
6192,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"yet, while it has not lost to his eye its first fearful gloss and glory,"
6193,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,it has gathered around it the dear or dismal associations of six
6194,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"thousand years; and Adam and the ""new-made widow"" seem to be leaning"
6195,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,side by side over its dust. We could have conceived of him treating the
6196,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"subject more reconditely, imaginatively, and metaphysically, but not of"
6197,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,handling it with more direct and masculine power.
6198,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6199,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"That he has done so, is, undoubtedly, one great cause of the poem's"
6200,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,popularity. Had he woven any gossamer of reverie or philosophic
6201,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"conjecture over ""the Grave,"" or even shown much personal interest in it,"
6202,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"he might have gained a more peculiar set of admirers, but would not have"
6203,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"won his way to the world's heart. As it is, the popularity of ""The"
6204,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Grave"" has been unbounded. Partly from the subject, partly from the"
6205,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"shortness, partly from the signal truth and force of the poem, it rose"
6206,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"rapidly to fame. It became ""everybody's Grave."" The poem was copied"
6207,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,into all school collections. It lay along with 'Robinson Crusoe' and
6208,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress', in the windows of cottages, and on the"
6209,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,tables of wayside inns--achieving thus what Coleridge predicated over
6210,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"that well-thumbed copy of 'Thomson's Seasons', in the Welsh"
6211,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"ale-house--""true fame!"" It pervaded America. It was translated into"
6212,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"other languages, and in its own it now transmigrated into a tract, now"
6213,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"filled the page of a periodical, and now became a small separate book,"
6214,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"telling its solemn tale to those who, though at first reluctant, as was"
6215,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"the wedding guest to hear the Anciente Marinere, were at last compelled"
6216,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"to listen, if not to learn. Light ballads and other amusing and clever"
6217,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"trifles, had before and have since thus ""put a girdle round about the"
6218,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"globe in forty minutes;"" but here was the phenomenon of a sad and"
6219,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"serious strain, with little merit or charm but Christian truth and"
6220,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"rugged poetry, passing, as if on telegraphic wires, through the whole"
6221,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"world in a moment of time. Perhaps we should add a reason, although a"
6222,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"very subordinate one, for the popularity of the poem. It was its"
6223,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,author's 'first' and 'last'. He wrote himself at once and easily
6224,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,'up'--he never tried and succeeded in writing himself laboriously
6225,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,'down'.
6226,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6227,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,The only books which should gain permanent reputation are those which
6228,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"supply materials for thought, and are studded with moveable gems of"
6229,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,expression. We think we may divide the poems of the past and present
6230,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"into two classes, which we may discriminate into 'buildings' and"
6231,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,'quarries'. Many works to which you can hardly deny the character of
6232,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"works of genius may be likened to elegant and splendid edifices, the"
6233,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"structure of which you cannot but admire, although the secret of their"
6234,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"architecture you do not understand, and although from them you neither"
6235,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"do nor can extract a single stone. They stand up before the view,"
6236,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"dazzling and confounding,--"
6237,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6238,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Distinct but distant, clear, but ah! how cold."""
6239,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6240,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Other books, less magnificent in aspect and rougher in style, are yet so"
6241,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"full of suggestive and germinating thought, that we must liken them to"
6242,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"quarries, surrounded it may be by thorns and briars, and precipices, but"
6243,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"containing the richest of matter, and communicating with the very depths"
6244,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,of the earth. Not to enter on the vexed questions connected with more
6245,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"celebrated poets, we may name Darwin and Dr Thomas Brown as two"
6246,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"specimens of the building, and Robert Blair as an admirable example of"
6247,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"the quarry. In household words and sententious truths, he yields (taking"
6248,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"his space into consideration), not even to Young, or Pope, or Cowper,"
6249,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,but to Shakspeare alone. His poem is a tissue of texts; many of his
6250,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,expressions might pass and have passed for bits of Hamlet. Take a few:--
6251,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6252,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6253,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Friendship, mysterious cement of the soul,"
6254,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Sweetener of life, and solder of society."""
6255,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6256,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Son of the morning, whither art thou gone?"
6257,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Where hast thou hid thy many-spangled head,"
6258,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,And the majestic menace of thine eyes
6259,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Felt from afar?"""
6260,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6261,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""Sorry pre-eminence of high descent!"
6262,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Above the vulgar, born to 'rot in state'."""
6263,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6264,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6265,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Hence, by the way, Byron's famous lines,--"
6266,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6267,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6268,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""It seem'd the mockery of hell to fold"
6269,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"The 'rottenness' of eighty years in gold."""
6270,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6271,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6272,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,The exquisite description of beauty in the grave has been already
6273,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"quoted. That of the strong man dying is quite Shakspearian, and equally"
6274,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"so is the picture commencing, ""Death's shafts fly quick,"" particularly"
6275,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,the passage about the sexton. How much he has compressed in the few
6276,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,words of the celebrated description!--
6277,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6278,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6279,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""The wind is up; hark! how it howls! methinks"
6280,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,Till now I never heard a sound so dreary;
6281,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Doors creak, and windows clap, and night's foul bird,"
6282,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Rook'd in the spire, screams loud."""
6283,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6284,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6285,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Who Blair's favourite authors were, we are not informed, but internal"
6286,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,evidence proves him to have frequently and profitably read Shakspeare;
6287,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"and in terseness of description, comprehensiveness of vision, careless"
6288,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"grandeur of execution, and short felicitous strokes of genius, he bears"
6289,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,to him a considerable resemblance.
6290,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6291,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Blair's originality is proved by the fact, that many poets since have"
6292,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"been either indebted to or inspired by his manly, noble verse. A great"
6293,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"original, although he seldom steals himself, is the innocent cause of"
6294,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"much theft in others, and his writings tempt, like the unbolted gate of"
6295,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"a bank, to plunder. Young, although a truly gifted man, has kindled his"
6296,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"night-lamp again and again at the phosphoric flame of ""The Grave."" The"
6297,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"author of the ""Night Thoughts"" has written more sustained and sounding"
6298,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"passages than Blair; his style is more antithetic, and his general mode"
6299,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,of thought more ingenious; his book is a much larger one; he exhibits at
6300,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,times gleams of deeper insight; has occasional bursts of more
6301,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"impassioned earnestness; and his work has a personal interest, like an"
6302,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"interrupted story or imperfect plot running through it: but ""The Grave"""
6303,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"is superior in ease, in nature, in healthy tone, and in those happy"
6304,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,touches which light upon even genius only in rare and favoured hours. In
6305,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"some of these points, as well as in a certain power of rough moral"
6306,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"anatomy, and vivid hurrying sarcasm (like one in haste lifting,"
6307,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"handling, and striking with a red-hot falchion), Blair reminds us rather"
6308,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"of Cowper; but the poet of ""The Task"" teaches a sterner morality, wears"
6309,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"around him a mantle of austerer gloom, abounds more in Scriptural"
6310,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"reference and in purely theological matter, and exhibits a more"
6311,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"thoroughly bardic and prophetic spirit. James Grahame, the author of"
6312,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""The Sabbath,"" resembles Blair somewhat in happy pictorial flashes, and"
6313,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"in the frequent rudeness of his versification; but is, on the whole, a"
6314,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"milder, a more refined, a tenderer, and a weaker writer. It is clear"
6315,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"that Pollok found the germ of his noble poem, ""The Course of Time,"" in"
6316,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""The Grave."" They resemble each other in their want of a plot, a hinge,"
6317,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"a ""back-bone,"" both being collections of loosely-strung moral sketches,"
6318,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"with no unity but that of spirit, as also in the homely force and"
6319,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"boldness of the writing; and if Pollok in aught differ from Blair, it is"
6320,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"partly in the length of his poem and its elaboration, and partly in that"
6321,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"feverish, hectic heat, and that morbid intensity and fury of"
6322,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"temperament, which are the sources of much of Pollok's strength, and of"
6323,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"more of his weakness. No poem on any similar subject, in our time, can"
6324,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"be named with Blair's, except perhaps Bryant's ""Thanatopsis."" The moral"
6325,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"tendency, however, and religious tone of the two poems are entirely"
6326,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"different. ""Thanatopsis"" looks at the Grave solely in its physical and"
6327,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,poetical aspects. It never mentions either the Resurrection or the
6328,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,Future State. An Indian would have coloured his poem on the sepulchre
6329,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"with finer and fierier lines, like the stamp of autumn on the fallen"
6330,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"leaf. The main idea in it (an idea probably suggested by a line in ""The"
6331,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Grave""--"
6332,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6333,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"""What is this world?"
6334,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"What but a spacious burial-place unwall'd?"")"
6335,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6336,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,is that of the earth as a great sepulchre; and its lesson is to
6337,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"inculcate on the death-devoted dust, which we call man, the duty of"
6338,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,dropping into its kindred dust as quietly and gracefully as possible. It
6339,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"is, as a poem, chiefly remarkable for its solemn music, which reminds"
6340,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"you of a burial-march, but is far inferior to the Scottish poem in lofty"
6341,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"moral, in theological truth, and in illustrative power. Blair, and not"
6342,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Bryant, remains the laureate of the Grave."
6343,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,
6344,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,It is much to have one's name and fame connected with one of the great
6345,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"centrical truths of the universe, especially when that truth is related"
6346,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,to a fact. Suppose a writer to have produced a great poem on Light and
6347,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,the Sun--or on Absolute Being and God--or on Immortal Life and
6348,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,Heaven--how sublime and how enviable were his reputation! It were for
6349,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"ever bound up, in the bundle of life, with these great Ideas and Facts."
6350,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"Now, Blair has sung, in notes as yet unequalled, one of the cardinal,"
6351,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"although one of the gloomiest thoughts and actualities in existence, and"
6352,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"his name ought to stand proportionally high. He has, in a solemn yet"
6353,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"happy hour, turned aside from the highways, and the byeways too, of the"
6354,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"world, and gone a-musing and meditating, like Isaac in the evening"
6355,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"fields, and found among these a field of the dead, a place of skulls;"
6356,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"and, returning home, has recorded that one brief meditation in verse,"
6357,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"and made it and himself immortal. Such, precisely, is this Poem, and"
6358,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"such the experience of this Poet. As long as ""the mourners go about the"
6359,THE LIFE OF ROBERT BLAIR.,"streets,"" or assemble in their crowds, blackening the silent 'braes' on"

6381,THE GRAVE.,
6382,THE GRAVE.,
6383,THE GRAVE.,"While some affect the sun, and some the shade,"
6384,THE GRAVE.,"Some flee the city, some the hermitage;"
6385,THE GRAVE.,"Their aims as various, as the roads they take"
6386,THE GRAVE.,"In journeying through life;--the task be mine,"
6387,THE GRAVE.,To paint the gloomy horrors of the tomb;
6388,THE GRAVE.,"The appointed place of rendezvous, where all"
6389,THE GRAVE.,"These travellers meet.--Thy succours I implore,"
6390,THE GRAVE.,Eternal king! whose potent arm sustains
6391,THE GRAVE.,"The keys of Hell and Death.--The Grave, dread thing!"
6392,THE GRAVE.,Men shiver when thou'rt named: Nature appall'd           10
6393,THE GRAVE.,Shakes off her wonted firmness. Ah! how dark
6394,THE GRAVE.,"Thy long-extended realms, and rueful wastes!"
6395,THE GRAVE.,"Where nought but silence reigns, and night, dark night,"
6396,THE GRAVE.,"Dark as was chaos, ere the infant Sun"
6397,THE GRAVE.,"Was roll'd together, or had tried his beams"
6398,THE GRAVE.,"Athwart the gloom profound.--The sickly taper,"
6399,THE GRAVE.,By glimmering through thy low-brow'd misty vaults
6400,THE GRAVE.,"(Furr'd round with mouldy damps, and ropy slime),"
6401,THE GRAVE.,"Lets fall a supernumerary horror,"
6402,THE GRAVE.,And only serves to make thy night more irksome.          20
6403,THE GRAVE.,"Well do I know thee by thy trusty yew,"
6404,THE GRAVE.,"Cheerless, unsocial plant! that loves to dwell"
6405,THE GRAVE.,"'Midst skulls and coffins, epitaphs and worms:"
6406,THE GRAVE.,"Where light-heel'd ghosts, and visionary shades,"
6407,THE GRAVE.,Beneath the wan cold moon (as fame reports)
6408,THE GRAVE.,"Embodied, thick, perform their mystic rounds:"
6409,THE GRAVE.,"No other merriment, dull tree! is thine."
6410,THE GRAVE.,See yonder hallow'd fane--the pious work
6411,THE GRAVE.,"Of names once famed, now dubious or forgot,"
6412,THE GRAVE.,And buried 'midst the wreck of things which were;        30
6413,THE GRAVE.,There lie interr'd the more illustrious dead.
6414,THE GRAVE.,The wind is up: hark! how it howls! Methinks
6415,THE GRAVE.,Till now I never heard a sound so dreary:
6416,THE GRAVE.,"Doors creak, and windows clap, and night's foul bird,"
6417,THE GRAVE.,"Rook'd in the spire, screams loud: the gloomy aisles"
6418,THE GRAVE.,"Black-plaster'd, and hung round with shreds of 'scutcheons,"
6419,THE GRAVE.,"And tatter'd coats of arms, send back the sound,"
6420,THE GRAVE.,"Laden with heavier airs, from the low vaults,"
6421,THE GRAVE.,"The mansions of the dead.--Roused from their slumbers,"
6422,THE GRAVE.,"In grim array the grisly spectres rise,                  40"
6423,THE GRAVE.,"Grin horrible, and, obstinately sullen,"
6424,THE GRAVE.,"Pass and repass, hush'd as the foot of night."
6425,THE GRAVE.,Again the screech-owl shrieks: ungracious sound!
6426,THE GRAVE.,I'll hear no more; it makes one's blood run chill.
6427,THE GRAVE.,"Quite round the pile, a row of reverend elms,"
6428,THE GRAVE.,"Coeval near with that, all ragged show,"
6429,THE GRAVE.,Long lash'd by the rude winds: some rift half down
6430,THE GRAVE.,"Their branchless trunks; others so thin at top,"
6431,THE GRAVE.,That scarce two crows could lodge in the same tree.
6432,THE GRAVE.,"Strange things, the neighbours say, have happen'd here:  50"
6433,THE GRAVE.,Wild shrieks have issued from the hollow tombs;
6434,THE GRAVE.,"Dead men have come again, and walk'd about;"
6435,THE GRAVE.,"And the great bell has toll'd, unrung, untouch'd!"
6436,THE GRAVE.,"(Such tales their cheer at wake or gossipping,"
6437,THE GRAVE.,When it draws near to witching time of night.)
6438,THE GRAVE.,"Oft, in the lone church-yard at night I've seen,"
6439,THE GRAVE.,"By glimpse of moonshine chequering through the trees,"
6440,THE GRAVE.,"The schoolboy with his satchel in his hand,"
6441,THE GRAVE.,"Whistling aloud to bear his courage up,"
6442,THE GRAVE.,And lightly tripping o'er the long flat stones           60
6443,THE GRAVE.,"(With nettles skirted, and with moss o'ergrown),"
6444,THE GRAVE.,That tell in homely phrase who lie below.
6445,THE GRAVE.,"Sudden he starts! and hears, or thinks he hears,"
6446,THE GRAVE.,The sound of something purring at his heels;
6447,THE GRAVE.,"Full fast he flies, and dares not look behind him,"
6448,THE GRAVE.,Till out of breath he overtakes his fellows;
6449,THE GRAVE.,"Who gather round, and wonder at the tale"
6450,THE GRAVE.,"Of horrid apparition, tall and ghastly,"
6451,THE GRAVE.,"That walks at dead of night, or takes his stand"
6452,THE GRAVE.,"O'er some new-open'd grave, and, strange to tell!        70"
6453,THE GRAVE.,Evanishes at crowing of the cock.
6454,THE GRAVE.,"The new-made widow too, I've sometimes spied,"
6455,THE GRAVE.,Sad sight! slow moving o'er the prostrate dead:
6456,THE GRAVE.,"Listless, she crawls along in doleful black,"
6457,THE GRAVE.,"Whilst bursts of sorrow gush from either eye,"
6458,THE GRAVE.,Past falling down her now untasted cheek.
6459,THE GRAVE.,Prone on the lowly grave of the dear man
6460,THE GRAVE.,"She drops; whilst busy meddling memory,"
6461,THE GRAVE.,"In barbarous succession, musters up"
6462,THE GRAVE.,"The past endearments of their softer hours,              80"
6463,THE GRAVE.,"Tenacious of its theme. Still, still she thinks"
6464,THE GRAVE.,"She sees him, and, indulging the fond thought,"
6465,THE GRAVE.,"Clings yet more closely to the senseless turf,"
6466,THE GRAVE.,Nor heeds the passenger who looks that way.
6467,THE GRAVE.,Invidious grave!--how dost thou rend in sunder
6468,THE GRAVE.,"Whom love has knit, and sympathy made one!"
6469,THE GRAVE.,A tie more stubborn far than nature's band.
6470,THE GRAVE.,Friendship! mysterious cement of the soul;
6471,THE GRAVE.,"Sweetener of life, and solder of society!"
6472,THE GRAVE.,"I owe thee much: thou hast deserved from me,             90"
6473,THE GRAVE.,"Far, far beyond what I can ever pay."
6474,THE GRAVE.,"Oft have I proved the labours of thy love,"
6475,THE GRAVE.,"And the warm efforts of the gentle heart,"
6476,THE GRAVE.,Anxious to please.--Oh! when my friend and I
6477,THE GRAVE.,"In some thick wood have wander'd heedless on,"
6478,THE GRAVE.,"Hid from the vulgar eye, and sat us down"
6479,THE GRAVE.,"Upon the sloping cowslip-cover'd bank,"
6480,THE GRAVE.,Where the pure limpid stream has slid along
6481,THE GRAVE.,"In grateful errors through the underwood,"
6482,THE GRAVE.,"Sweet murmuring,--methought the shrill-tongued thrush    100"
6483,THE GRAVE.,Mended his song of love; the sooty blackbird
6484,THE GRAVE.,"Mellow'd his pipe, and soften'd every note;"
6485,THE GRAVE.,"The eglantine smelt sweeter, and the rose"
6486,THE GRAVE.,Assumed a dye more deep; whilst every flower
6487,THE GRAVE.,Vied with its fellow-plant in luxury
6488,THE GRAVE.,Of dress.--Oh! then the longest summer's day
6489,THE GRAVE.,"Seem'd too, too much in haste: still the full heart"
6490,THE GRAVE.,Had not imparted half! 'twas happiness
6491,THE GRAVE.,"Too exquisite to last. Of joys departed,"
6492,THE GRAVE.,"Not to return, how painful the remembrance!              110"
6493,THE GRAVE.,"Dull Grave!--thou spoil'st the dance of youthful blood,"
6494,THE GRAVE.,"Strik'st out the dimple from the cheek of mirth,"
6495,THE GRAVE.,And every smirking feature from the face;
6496,THE GRAVE.,Branding our laughter with the name of madness.
6497,THE GRAVE.,Where are the jesters now? the men of health
6498,THE GRAVE.,"Complexionally pleasant? Where the droll,"
6499,THE GRAVE.,Whose every look and gesture was a joke
6500,THE GRAVE.,"To clapping theatres and shouting crowds,"
6501,THE GRAVE.,And made even thick-lipp'd musing melancholy
6502,THE GRAVE.,To gather up her face into a smile                       120
6503,THE GRAVE.,"Before she was aware? Ah! sullen now,"
6504,THE GRAVE.,And dumb as the green turf that covers them.
6505,THE GRAVE.,Where are the mighty thunderbolts of war?
6506,THE GRAVE.,"The Roman Cæsars, and the Grecian chiefs,"
6507,THE GRAVE.,"The boast of story?  Where the hotbrain'd youth,"
6508,THE GRAVE.,Who the tiara at his pleasure tore
6509,THE GRAVE.,"From kings of all the then discover'd globe,"
6510,THE GRAVE.,"And cried, forsooth, because his arm was hamper'd,"
6511,THE GRAVE.,And had not room enough to do its work?--
6512,THE GRAVE.,"Alas! how slim, dishonourably slim,                      130"
6513,THE GRAVE.,And cramm'd into a place we blush to name!
6514,THE GRAVE.,Proud Royalty! how alter'd in thy looks!
6515,THE GRAVE.,"How blank thy features, and how wan thy hue!"
6516,THE GRAVE.,"Son of the morning, whither art thou gone?"
6517,THE GRAVE.,"Where hast thou hid thy many-spangled head,"
6518,THE GRAVE.,"And the majestic menace of thine eyes,"
6519,THE GRAVE.,"Felt from afar? Pliant and powerless now,"
6520,THE GRAVE.,"Like new-born infant wound up in his swathes,"
6521,THE GRAVE.,"Or victim tumbled flat upon its back,"
6522,THE GRAVE.,That throbs beneath the sacrificer's knife.              140
6523,THE GRAVE.,"Mute must thou bear the strife of little tongues,"
6524,THE GRAVE.,"And coward insults of the base-born crowd,"
6525,THE GRAVE.,"That grudge a privilege thou never hadst,"
6526,THE GRAVE.,"But only hoped for in the peaceful grave,"
6527,THE GRAVE.,Of being unmolested and alone.
6528,THE GRAVE.,"Arabia's gums and odoriferous drugs,"
6529,THE GRAVE.,And honours by the heralds duly paid
6530,THE GRAVE.,In mode and form even to a very scruple:
6531,THE GRAVE.,"Oh, cruel irony! these come too late;"
6532,THE GRAVE.,"And only mock whom they were meant to honour,            150"
6533,THE GRAVE.,Surely there's not a dungeon slave that's buried
6534,THE GRAVE.,"In the highway, unshrouded and uncoffin'd,"
6535,THE GRAVE.,"But lies as soft, and sleeps as sound as he."
6536,THE GRAVE.,"Sorry pre-eminence of high descent,"
6537,THE GRAVE.,"Above the vulgar born, to rot in state!"
6538,THE GRAVE.,"But see! the well plumed hearse comes nodding on,"
6539,THE GRAVE.,Stately and slow; and properly attended
6540,THE GRAVE.,By the whole sable tribe that painful watch
6541,THE GRAVE.,"The sick man's door, and live upon the dead,"
6542,THE GRAVE.,"By letting out their persons by the hour,                160"
6543,THE GRAVE.,To mimic sorrow when the heart's not sad.
6544,THE GRAVE.,"How rich the trappings, now they're all unfurl'd"
6545,THE GRAVE.,And glittering in the sun! Triumphant entries
6546,THE GRAVE.,"Of conquerors, and coronation pomps,"
6547,THE GRAVE.,In glory scarce exceed. Great gluts of people
6548,THE GRAVE.,Retard the unwieldy show; whilst from the casements
6549,THE GRAVE.,"And houses' tops, ranks behind ranks close wedged"
6550,THE GRAVE.,"Hang bellying o'er. But tell us, why this waste?"
6551,THE GRAVE.,Why this ado in earthing up a carcase
6552,THE GRAVE.,"That's fallen into disgrace, and in the nostril          170"
6553,THE GRAVE.,"Smells horrible?--Ye undertakers, tell us,"
6554,THE GRAVE.,"'Midst all the gorgeous figures you exhibit,"
6555,THE GRAVE.,"Why is the principal conceal'd, for which"
6556,THE GRAVE.,You make this mighty stir?--'Tis wisely done;
6557,THE GRAVE.,"What would offend the eye in a good picture,"
6558,THE GRAVE.,The painter casts discreetly into shade.
6559,THE GRAVE.,Proud lineage! now how little thou appear'st!
6560,THE GRAVE.,Below the envy of the private man!
6561,THE GRAVE.,"Honour, that meddlesome officious ill,"
6562,THE GRAVE.,"Pursues thee even to death, nor there stops short;       180"
6563,THE GRAVE.,Strange persecution! when the grave itself
6564,THE GRAVE.,Is no protection from rude sufferance.
6565,THE GRAVE.,"Absurd to think to overreach the grave,"
6566,THE GRAVE.,And from the wreck of names to rescue ours!
6567,THE GRAVE.,The best-concerted schemes men lay for fame
6568,THE GRAVE.,Die fast away: only themselves die faster.
6569,THE GRAVE.,"The far-famed sculptor, and the laurell'd bard,"
6570,THE GRAVE.,"Those bold insurancers of deathless fame,"
6571,THE GRAVE.,Supply their little feeble aids in vain.
6572,THE GRAVE.,"The tapering pyramid, the Egyptian's pride,              190"
6573,THE GRAVE.,And wonder of the world; whose spiky top
6574,THE GRAVE.,"Has wounded the thick cloud, and long outlived"
6575,THE GRAVE.,The angry shaking of the winter's storm;
6576,THE GRAVE.,"Yet spent at last by the injuries of heaven,"
6577,THE GRAVE.,"Shatter'd with age and furrow'd o'er with years,"
6578,THE GRAVE.,"The mystic cone, with hieroglyphics crusted,"
6579,THE GRAVE.,"At once gives way. Oh, lamentable sight!"
6580,THE GRAVE.,"The labour of whole ages tumbles down,"
6581,THE GRAVE.,A hideous and mis-shapen length of ruins.
6582,THE GRAVE.,"Sepulchral columns wrestle, but in vain,                 200"
6583,THE GRAVE.,With all-subduing Time: his cankering hand
6584,THE GRAVE.,With calm deliberate malice wasteth them:
6585,THE GRAVE.,"Worn on the edge of days, the brass consumes,"
6586,THE GRAVE.,"The busto moulders, and the deep-cut marble,"
6587,THE GRAVE.,"Unsteady to the steel, gives up its charge."
6588,THE GRAVE.,"Ambition, half convicted of her folly,"
6589,THE GRAVE.,"Hangs down the head, and reddens at the tale."
6590,THE GRAVE.,"Here, all the mighty troublers of the earth,"
6591,THE GRAVE.,Who swam to sovereign rule through seas of blood;
6592,THE GRAVE.,"The oppressive, sturdy, man-destroying villains,         210"
6593,THE GRAVE.,"Who ravaged kingdoms, and laid empires waste,"
6594,THE GRAVE.,And in a cruel wantonness of power
6595,THE GRAVE.,"Thinn'd states of half their people, and gave up"
6596,THE GRAVE.,"To want the rest; now, like a storm that's spent,"
6597,THE GRAVE.,"Lie hush'd, and meanly sneak behind the covert."
6598,THE GRAVE.,Vain thought! to hide them from the general scorn
6599,THE GRAVE.,That haunts and dogs them like an injured ghost
6600,THE GRAVE.,"Implacable. Here, too, the petty tyrant,"
6601,THE GRAVE.,"Whose scant domains geographer ne'er noticed,"
6602,THE GRAVE.,"And, well for neighbouring grounds, of arm as short;     220"
6603,THE GRAVE.,"Who fix'd his iron talons on the poor,"
6604,THE GRAVE.,And gripp'd them like some lordly beast of prey;
6605,THE GRAVE.,"Deaf to the forceful cries of gnawing hunger,"
6606,THE GRAVE.,"And piteous, plaintive voice of misery"
6607,THE GRAVE.,"(As if a slave was not a shred of nature,"
6608,THE GRAVE.,Of the same common nature with his lord);
6609,THE GRAVE.,"Now tame and humble, like a child that's whipp'd,"
6610,THE GRAVE.,"Shakes hands with dust, and calls the worm his kinsman;"
6611,THE GRAVE.,Nor pleads his rank and birthright: Under ground
6612,THE GRAVE.,"Precedency's a jest; vassal and lord,                    230"
6613,THE GRAVE.,"Grossly familiar, side by side consume."
6614,THE GRAVE.,"When self-esteem, or others' adulation,"
6615,THE GRAVE.,Would cunningly persuade us we are something
6616,THE GRAVE.,"Above the common level of our kind,"
6617,THE GRAVE.,"The Grave gainsays the smooth-complexion'd flattery,"
6618,THE GRAVE.,And with blunt truth acquaints us what we are.
6619,THE GRAVE.,"Beauty,--thou pretty plaything, dear deceit!"
6620,THE GRAVE.,"That steals so softly o'er the stripling's heart,"
6621,THE GRAVE.,"And gives it a new pulse, unknown before,"
6622,THE GRAVE.,"The Grave discredits thee: thy charms expunged,          240"
6623,THE GRAVE.,"Thy roses faded, and thy lilies soil'd,"
6624,THE GRAVE.,What hast thou more to boast of? Will thy lovers
6625,THE GRAVE.,"Flock round thee now, to gaze and do thee homage?"
6626,THE GRAVE.,"Methinks I see thee with thy head low laid,"
6627,THE GRAVE.,"Whilst, surfeited upon thy damask cheek,"
6628,THE GRAVE.,"The high-fed worm, in lazy volumes roll'd,"
6629,THE GRAVE.,"Riots unscared. For this, was all thy caution?"
6630,THE GRAVE.,"For this, thy painful labours at thy glass?"
6631,THE GRAVE.,"To improve those charms and keep them in repair,"
6632,THE GRAVE.,For which the spoiler thanks thee not. Foul feeder!      250
6633,THE GRAVE.,"Coarse fare and carrion please thee full as well,"
6634,THE GRAVE.,And leave as keen a relish on the sense.
6635,THE GRAVE.,Look how the fair one weeps!--the conscious tears
6636,THE GRAVE.,Stand thick as dew-drops on the bells of flowers:
6637,THE GRAVE.,Honest effusion! the swoln heart in vain
6638,THE GRAVE.,Works hard to put a gloss on its distress.
6639,THE GRAVE.,"Strength, too,--thou surly, and less gentle boast"
6640,THE GRAVE.,Of those that laugh loud at the village ring!
6641,THE GRAVE.,A fit of common sickness pulls thee down
6642,THE GRAVE.,With greater ease than e'er thou didst the stripling     260
6643,THE GRAVE.,That rashly dared thee to the unequal fight.
6644,THE GRAVE.,What groan was that I heard?--deep groan indeed!
6645,THE GRAVE.,With anguish heavy laden; let me trace it:
6646,THE GRAVE.,"From yonder bed it comes, where the strong man,"
6647,THE GRAVE.,"By stronger arm belabour'd, gasps for breath"
6648,THE GRAVE.,Like a hard-hunted beast. How his great heart
6649,THE GRAVE.,Beats thick! his roomy chest by far too scant
6650,THE GRAVE.,To give the lungs full play. What now avail
6651,THE GRAVE.,"The strong-built, sinewy limbs, and well spread shoulders?"
6652,THE GRAVE.,"See how he tugs for life, and lays about him,            270"
6653,THE GRAVE.,Mad with his pains!--Eager he catches hold
6654,THE GRAVE.,"Of what comes next to hand, and grasps it hard,"
6655,THE GRAVE.,Just like a creature drowning;--hideous sight!
6656,THE GRAVE.,"Oh! how his eyes stand out, and stare full ghastly!"
6657,THE GRAVE.,While the distemper's rank and deadly venom
6658,THE GRAVE.,"Shoots like a burning arrow 'cross his bowels,"
6659,THE GRAVE.,And drinks his marrow up.--Heard you that groan?
6660,THE GRAVE.,"It was his last.--See how the great Goliath,"
6661,THE GRAVE.,"Just like a child that brawl'd itself to rest,"
6662,THE GRAVE.,"Lies still.--What mean'st thou then, O mighty boaster!   280"
6663,THE GRAVE.,"To vaunt of nerves of thine? What means the bull,"
6664,THE GRAVE.,"Unconscious of his strength, to play the coward,"
6665,THE GRAVE.,"And flee before a feeble thing like man,"
6666,THE GRAVE.,"That, knowing well the slackness of his arm,"
6667,THE GRAVE.,Trusts only in the well-invented knife?
6668,THE GRAVE.,"With study pale, and midnight vigils spent,"
6669,THE GRAVE.,"The star-surveying sage, close to his eye"
6670,THE GRAVE.,Applies the sight-invigorating tube;
6671,THE GRAVE.,"And, travelling through the boundless length of space,"
6672,THE GRAVE.,"Marks well the courses of the far-seen orbs,             290"
6673,THE GRAVE.,"That roll with regular confusion there,"
6674,THE GRAVE.,"In ecstasy of thought. But, ah, proud man!"
6675,THE GRAVE.,Great heights are hazardous to the weak head;
6676,THE GRAVE.,"Soon, very soon, thy firmest footing fails;"
6677,THE GRAVE.,"And down thou dropp'st into that darksome place,"
6678,THE GRAVE.,Where nor device nor knowledge ever came.
6679,THE GRAVE.,"Here the tongue-warrior lies, disabled now,"
6680,THE GRAVE.,"Disarm'd, dishonour'd, like a wretch that's gagg'd,"
6681,THE GRAVE.,And cannot tell his ails to passers-by.
6682,THE GRAVE.,"Great man of language!--whence this mighty change,       300"
6683,THE GRAVE.,"This dumb despair, and drooping of the head?"
6684,THE GRAVE.,"Though strong persuasion hung upon thy lip,"
6685,THE GRAVE.,And sly insinuation's softer arts
6686,THE GRAVE.,In ambush lay about thy flowing tongue;
6687,THE GRAVE.,"Alas, how chop-fallen now! Thick mists and silence"
6688,THE GRAVE.,"Rest, like a weary cloud, upon thy breast"
6689,THE GRAVE.,"Unceasing.--Ah! where is the lifted arm,"
6690,THE GRAVE.,"The strength of action, and the force of words,"
6691,THE GRAVE.,"The well-turn'd period, and the well-timed voice,"
6692,THE GRAVE.,With all the lesser ornaments of phrase?                 310
6693,THE GRAVE.,"Ah! fled for ever, as they ne'er had been;"
6694,THE GRAVE.,"Razed from the book of fame; or, more provoking,"
6695,THE GRAVE.,Perchance some hackney hunger-bitten scribbler
6696,THE GRAVE.,"Insults thy memory, and blots thy tomb"
6697,THE GRAVE.,"With long flat narrative, or duller rhymes,"
6698,THE GRAVE.,With heavy halting pace that drawl along;
6699,THE GRAVE.,"Enough to rouse a dead man into rage,"
6700,THE GRAVE.,And warm with red resentment the wan cheek.
6701,THE GRAVE.,"Here the great masters of the healing art,"
6702,THE GRAVE.,"These mighty mock defrauders of the tomb,                320"
6703,THE GRAVE.,"Spite of their juleps and catholicons,"
6704,THE GRAVE.,Resign to fate.--Proud Æsculapius' son!
6705,THE GRAVE.,"Where are thy boasted implements of art,"
6706,THE GRAVE.,And all thy well-cramm'd magazines of health?
6707,THE GRAVE.,"Nor hill nor vale, as far as ship could go,"
6708,THE GRAVE.,"Nor margin of the gravel-bottom'd brook,"
6709,THE GRAVE.,Escaped thy rifling hand;--from stubborn shrubs
6710,THE GRAVE.,"Thou wrung'st their shy retiring virtues out,"
6711,THE GRAVE.,"And vex'd them in the fire: nor fly, nor insect,"
6712,THE GRAVE.,"Nor writhy snake, escaped thy deep research.             330"
6713,THE GRAVE.,But why this apparatus  Why this cost?
6714,THE GRAVE.,"Tell us, thou doughty keeper from the grave,"
6715,THE GRAVE.,"Where are thy recipes and cordials now,"
6716,THE GRAVE.,With the long list of vouchers for thy cures?
6717,THE GRAVE.,Alas! thou speakest not.--The bold impostor
6718,THE GRAVE.,Looks not more silly when the cheat's found out.
6719,THE GRAVE.,"Here the lank-sided miser, worst of felons,"
6720,THE GRAVE.,Who meanly stole (discreditable shift!)
6721,THE GRAVE.,"From back, and belly too, their proper cheer,"
6722,THE GRAVE.,Eased of a tax it irk'd the wretch to pay                340
6723,THE GRAVE.,"To his own carcase, now lies cheaply lodged."
6724,THE GRAVE.,"By clamorous appetites no longer teased,"
6725,THE GRAVE.,Nor tedious bills of charges and repairs.
6726,THE GRAVE.,"But, ah! where are his rents, his comings-in?"
6727,THE GRAVE.,Ay! now you've made the rich man poor indeed;
6728,THE GRAVE.,"Robb'd of his gods, what has he left behind?"
6729,THE GRAVE.,O cursed lust of gold! when for thy sake
6730,THE GRAVE.,The fool throws up his interest in both worlds;
6731,THE GRAVE.,"First starved in this, then damn'd in that to come."
6732,THE GRAVE.,"How shocking must thy summons be, O Death!             350"
6733,THE GRAVE.,To him that is at ease in his possessions;
6734,THE GRAVE.,"Who, counting on long years of pleasure here,"
6735,THE GRAVE.,Is quite unfurnish'd for that world to come!
6736,THE GRAVE.,"In that dread moment, how the frantic soul"
6737,THE GRAVE.,"Raves round the walls of her clay tenement,"
6738,THE GRAVE.,"Runs to each avenue, and shrieks for help,"
6739,THE GRAVE.,But shrieks in vain!--How wishfully she looks
6740,THE GRAVE.,"On all she's leaving, now no longer her's!"
6741,THE GRAVE.,"A little longer, yet a little longer,"
6742,THE GRAVE.,"Oh! might she stay, to wash away her stains,             360"
6743,THE GRAVE.,And fit her for her passage.--Mournful sight!
6744,THE GRAVE.,Her very eyes weep blood;--and every groan
6745,THE GRAVE.,"She heaves is big with horror: but the foe,"
6746,THE GRAVE.,"Like a staunch murderer, steady to his purpose,"
6747,THE GRAVE.,"Pursues her close through every lane of life,"
6748,THE GRAVE.,"Nor misses once the track, but presses on;"
6749,THE GRAVE.,"Till, forced at last to the tremendous verge,"
6750,THE GRAVE.,At once she sinks to everlasting ruin.
6751,THE GRAVE.,"Sure 'tis a serious thing to die! My soul,"
6752,THE GRAVE.,"What a strange moment it must be, when near              370"
6753,THE GRAVE.,"Thy journey's end, thou hast the gulf in view!"
6754,THE GRAVE.,That awful gulf no mortal e'er repass'd
6755,THE GRAVE.,To tell what's doing on the other side.
6756,THE GRAVE.,"Nature runs back and shudders at the sight,"
6757,THE GRAVE.,And every life-string bleeds at thoughts of parting;
6758,THE GRAVE.,For part they must: body and soul must part;
6759,THE GRAVE.,Fond couple! link'd more close than wedded pair.
6760,THE GRAVE.,"This wings its way to its Almighty Source,"
6761,THE GRAVE.,"The witness of its actions, now its judge:"
6762,THE GRAVE.,"That drops into the dark and noisome grave,              380"
6763,THE GRAVE.,Like a disabled pitcher of no use.
6764,THE GRAVE.,"If death were nothing, and nought after death;"
6765,THE GRAVE.,"If when men died, at once they ceased to be,"
6766,THE GRAVE.,"Returning to the barren womb of nothing,"
6767,THE GRAVE.,Whence first they sprung; then might the debauchee
6768,THE GRAVE.,Untrembling mouth the heavens:--then might the drunkard
6769,THE GRAVE.,"Reel over his full bowl, and, when 'tis drain'd,"
6770,THE GRAVE.,"Fill up another to the brim, and laugh"
6771,THE GRAVE.,At the poor bugbear Death: then might the wretch
6772,THE GRAVE.,"That's weary of the world, and tired of life,            390"
6773,THE GRAVE.,"At once give each inquietude the slip,"
6774,THE GRAVE.,"By stealing out of being when he pleased,"
6775,THE GRAVE.,"And by what way, whether by hemp, or steel."
6776,THE GRAVE.,Death's thousand doors stand open.--Who could force
6777,THE GRAVE.,"The ill pleased guest to sit out his full time,"
6778,THE GRAVE.,"Or blame him if he goes? Sure he does well,"
6779,THE GRAVE.,"That helps himself, as timely as he can,"
6780,THE GRAVE.,When able.--But if there's an Hereafter;
6781,THE GRAVE.,"And that there is, conscience, uninfluenced,"
6782,THE GRAVE.,"And suffer'd to speak out, tells every man;              400"
6783,THE GRAVE.,Then must it be an awful thing to die:
6784,THE GRAVE.,More horrid yet to die by one's own hand.
6785,THE GRAVE.,"Self-murder!--name it not: our island's shame,"
6786,THE GRAVE.,That makes her the reproach of neighbouring states.
6787,THE GRAVE.,"Shall nature, swerving from her earliest dictate,"
6788,THE GRAVE.,"Self-preservation, fall by her own act?"
6789,THE GRAVE.,"Forbid it, Heaven!--Let not upon disgust"
6790,THE GRAVE.,The shameless hand be foully crimson'd o'er
6791,THE GRAVE.,With blood of its own lord.--Dreadful attempt!
6792,THE GRAVE.,"Just reeking from self-slaughter, in a rage              410"
6793,THE GRAVE.,To rush into the presence of our Judge;
6794,THE GRAVE.,"As if we challenged him to do his worst,"
6795,THE GRAVE.,And matter'd not his wrath!--Unheard-of tortures
6796,THE GRAVE.,Must be reserved for such: these herd together;
6797,THE GRAVE.,"The common damn'd shun their society,"
6798,THE GRAVE.,And look upon themselves as fiends less foul.
6799,THE GRAVE.,Our time is fix'd; and all our days are number'd;
6800,THE GRAVE.,"How long, how short, we know not:--this we know,"
6801,THE GRAVE.,"Duty requires we calmly wait the summons,"
6802,THE GRAVE.,Nor dare to stir till Heaven shall give permission:      420
6803,THE GRAVE.,"Like sentries that must keep their destined stand,"
6804,THE GRAVE.,"And wait the appointed hour, till they're relieved."
6805,THE GRAVE.,"Those only are the brave who keep their ground,"
6806,THE GRAVE.,And keep it to the last. To run away
6807,THE GRAVE.,Is but a coward's trick: to run away
6808,THE GRAVE.,"From this world's ills, that at the very worst"
6809,THE GRAVE.,"Will soon blow o'er, thinking to mend ourselves,"
6810,THE GRAVE.,"By boldly venturing on a world unknown,"
6811,THE GRAVE.,And plunging headlong in the dark;--'tis mad!
6812,THE GRAVE.,No frenzy half so desperate as this.                     430
6813,THE GRAVE.,"Tell us, ye dead! will none of you, in pity"
6814,THE GRAVE.,"To those you left behind, disclose the secret?"
6815,THE GRAVE.,Oh! that some courteous ghost would blab it out;
6816,THE GRAVE.,"What 'tis you are, and we must shortly be."
6817,THE GRAVE.,I've heard that souls departed have sometimes
6818,THE GRAVE.,Forewarn'd men of their death:--'twas kindly done
6819,THE GRAVE.,"To knock, and give the alarm.--But what means"
6820,THE GRAVE.,This stinted charity?--'Tis but lame kindness
6821,THE GRAVE.,That does its work by halves.--Why might you not
6822,THE GRAVE.,Tell us what 'tis to die? do the strict laws             440
6823,THE GRAVE.,Of your society forbid your speaking
6824,THE GRAVE.,Upon a point so nice?--I'll ask no more:
6825,THE GRAVE.,"Sullen, like lamps in sepulchres, your shine"
6826,THE GRAVE.,"Enlightens but yourselves. Well, 'tis no matter;"
6827,THE GRAVE.,"A very little time will clear up all,"
6828,THE GRAVE.,"And make us learn'd as you are, and as close."
6829,THE GRAVE.,"Death's shafts fly thick!--Here falls the village-swain,"
6830,THE GRAVE.,And there his pamper'd lord!--The cup goes round;
6831,THE GRAVE.,And who so artful as to put it by?
6832,THE GRAVE.,'Tis long since death had the majority;                  450
6833,THE GRAVE.,"Yet, strange! the living lay it not to heart."
6834,THE GRAVE.,"See yonder maker of the dead man's bed,"
6835,THE GRAVE.,"The Sexton, hoary-headed chronicle;"
6836,THE GRAVE.,"Of hard, unmeaning face, down which ne'er stole"
6837,THE GRAVE.,A gentle tear; with mattock in his hand
6838,THE GRAVE.,"Digs through whole rows of kindred and acquaintance,"
6839,THE GRAVE.,"By far his juniors.--Scarce a skull's cast up,"
6840,THE GRAVE.,"But well he knew its owner, and can tell"
6841,THE GRAVE.,Some passage of his life.--Thus hand in hand
6842,THE GRAVE.,The sot has walk'd with death twice twenty years;        460
6843,THE GRAVE.,"And yet ne'er younker on the green laughs louder,"
6844,THE GRAVE.,"Or clubs a smuttier tale: when drunkards meet,"
6845,THE GRAVE.,"None sings a merrier catch, or lends a hand"
6846,THE GRAVE.,"More willing to his cup.--Poor wretch! he minds not,"
6847,THE GRAVE.,That soon some trusty brother of the trade
6848,THE GRAVE.,Shall do for him what he has done for thousands.
6849,THE GRAVE.,"On this side, and on that, men see their friends"
6850,THE GRAVE.,"Drop off, like leaves in autumn; yet launch out"
6851,THE GRAVE.,"Into fantastic schemes, which the long livers"
6852,THE GRAVE.,In the world's hale and undegenerate days                470
6853,THE GRAVE.,Could scarce have leisure for.--Fools that we are!
6854,THE GRAVE.,Never to think of death and of ourselves
6855,THE GRAVE.,At the same time: as if to learn to die
6856,THE GRAVE.,"Were no concern of ours.--O more than sottish,"
6857,THE GRAVE.,"For creatures of a day, in gamesome mood,"
6858,THE GRAVE.,To frolic on eternity's dread brink
6859,THE GRAVE.,"Unapprehensive; when, for aught we know,"
6860,THE GRAVE.,The very first swoln surge shall sweep us in!
6861,THE GRAVE.,"Think we, or think we not, time hurries on"
6862,THE GRAVE.,"With a resistless, unremitting stream;                   480"
6863,THE GRAVE.,"Yet treads more soft than e'er did midnight thief,"
6864,THE GRAVE.,"That slides his hand under the miser's pillow,"
6865,THE GRAVE.,And carries off his prize.--What is this world?
6866,THE GRAVE.,"What but a spacious burial-field unwall'd,"
6867,THE GRAVE.,"Strew'd with death's spoils, the spoils of animals"
6868,THE GRAVE.,"Savage and tame, and full of dead men's bones!"
6869,THE GRAVE.,The very turf on which we tread once lived;
6870,THE GRAVE.,And we that live must lend our carcases
6871,THE GRAVE.,To cover our own offspring: in their turns
6872,THE GRAVE.,They too must cover theirs.--'Tis here all meet!         490
6873,THE GRAVE.,"The shivering Icelander, and sun-burnt Moor;"
6874,THE GRAVE.,"Men of all climes, that never met before;"
6875,THE GRAVE.,"And of all creeds, the Jew, the Turk, the Christian."
6876,THE GRAVE.,"Here the proud prince, and favourite yet prouder,"
6877,THE GRAVE.,"His sovereign's keeper, and the people's scourge,"
6878,THE GRAVE.,Are huddled out of sight.--Here lie abash'd
6879,THE GRAVE.,"The great negotiators of the earth,"
6880,THE GRAVE.,"And celebrated masters of the balance,"
6881,THE GRAVE.,"Deep read in stratagems, and wiles of courts."
6882,THE GRAVE.,Now vain their treaty skill: death scorns to treat.      500
6883,THE GRAVE.,Here the o'er-loaded slave flings down his burden
6884,THE GRAVE.,"From his gall'd shoulders;--and when the cruel tyrant,"
6885,THE GRAVE.,"With all his guards and tools of power about him,"
6886,THE GRAVE.,"Is meditating new unheard-of hardships,"
6887,THE GRAVE.,"Mocks his short arm,--and, quick as thought, escapes"
6888,THE GRAVE.,"Where tyrants vex not, and the weary rest."
6889,THE GRAVE.,"Here the warm lover, leaving the cool shade,"
6890,THE GRAVE.,"The tell-tale echo, and the babbling stream"
6891,THE GRAVE.,"(Time out of mind the favourite seats of love),"
6892,THE GRAVE.,"Fast by his gentle mistress lays him down,               510"
6893,THE GRAVE.,Unblasted by foul tongue.--Here friends and foes
6894,THE GRAVE.,Lie close; unmindful of their former feuds.
6895,THE GRAVE.,"The lawn-robed prelate and plain presbyter,"
6896,THE GRAVE.,"Erewhile that stood aloof, as shy to meet,"
6897,THE GRAVE.,"Familiar mingle here, like sister streams"
6898,THE GRAVE.,That some rude interposing rock had split.
6899,THE GRAVE.,Here is the large-limb'd peasant;--here the child
6900,THE GRAVE.,"Of a span long, that never saw the sun,"
6901,THE GRAVE.,"Nor press'd the nipple, strangled in life's porch."
6902,THE GRAVE.,"Here is the mother, with her sons and daughters;         520"
6903,THE GRAVE.,"The barren wife; the long-demurring maid,"
6904,THE GRAVE.,Whose lonely unappropriated sweets
6905,THE GRAVE.,"Smiled like yon knot of cowslips on the cliff,"
6906,THE GRAVE.,Not to be come at by the willing hand.
6907,THE GRAVE.,"Here are the prude severe, and gay coquette,"
6908,THE GRAVE.,"The sober widow, and the young green virgin,"
6909,THE GRAVE.,"Cropp'd like a rose before 'tis fully blown,"
6910,THE GRAVE.,Or half its worth disclosed. Strange medley here!
6911,THE GRAVE.,Here garrulous old age winds up his tale;
6912,THE GRAVE.,"And jovial youth, of lightsome vacant heart,             530"
6913,THE GRAVE.,"Whose every day was made of melody,"
6914,THE GRAVE.,"Hears not the voice of mirth.--The shrill-tongued shrew,"
6915,THE GRAVE.,"Meek as the turtle-dove, forgets her chiding."
6916,THE GRAVE.,"Here are the wise, the generous, and the brave;"
6917,THE GRAVE.,"The just, the good, the worthless, the profane;"
6918,THE GRAVE.,"The downright clown, and perfectly well-bred;"
6919,THE GRAVE.,"The fool, the churl, the scoundrel, and the mean;"
6920,THE GRAVE.,"The supple statesman, and the patriot stern;"
6921,THE GRAVE.,"The wrecks of nations, and the spoils of time,"
6922,THE GRAVE.,With all the lumber of six thousand years.               540
6923,THE GRAVE.,Poor man!--how happy once in thy first state!
6924,THE GRAVE.,"When yet but warm from thy great Maker's hand,"
6925,THE GRAVE.,"He stamp'd thee with his image, and, well pleased,"
6926,THE GRAVE.,Smiled on his last fair work.--Then all was well.
6927,THE GRAVE.,"Sound was the body, and the soul serene;"
6928,THE GRAVE.,"Like two sweet instruments, ne'er out of tune,"
6929,THE GRAVE.,"That play their several parts.--Nor head, nor heart,"
6930,THE GRAVE.,Offer'd to ache: nor was there cause they should;
6931,THE GRAVE.,"For all was pure within: no fell remorse,"
6932,THE GRAVE.,"Nor anxious casting-up of what might be,                 550"
6933,THE GRAVE.,Alarm'd his peaceful bosom.--Summer seas
6934,THE GRAVE.,"Show not more smooth, when kiss'd by southern winds"
6935,THE GRAVE.,"Just ready to expire.--Scarce importuned,"
6936,THE GRAVE.,"The generous soil, with a luxuriant hand,"
6937,THE GRAVE.,"Offer'd the various produce of the year,"
6938,THE GRAVE.,And everything most perfect in its kind.
6939,THE GRAVE.,"Blessed! thrice-blessed days!--But ah, how short!"
6940,THE GRAVE.,Blest as the pleasing dreams of holy men;
6941,THE GRAVE.,"But fugitive like those, and quickly gone."
6942,THE GRAVE.,O slippery state of things!--What sudden turns!          560
6943,THE GRAVE.,What strange vicissitudes in the first leaf
6944,THE GRAVE.,"Of man's sad history!--To-day most happy,"
6945,THE GRAVE.,"And ere to-morrow's sun has set, most abject!"
6946,THE GRAVE.,How scant the space between these vast extremes!
6947,THE GRAVE.,Thus fared it with our sire:--not long he enjoy'd
6948,THE GRAVE.,His paradise.--Scarce had the happy tenant
6949,THE GRAVE.,"Of the fair spot due time to prove its sweets,"
6950,THE GRAVE.,"Or sum them up, when straight he must be gone,"
6951,THE GRAVE.,Ne'er to return again.--And must he go?
6952,THE GRAVE.,Can nought compound for the first dire offence           570
6953,THE GRAVE.,"Of erring man? Like one that is condemn'd,"
6954,THE GRAVE.,"Fain would he trifle time with idle talk,"
6955,THE GRAVE.,And parley with his fate. But 'tis in vain;
6956,THE GRAVE.,"Not all the lavish odours of the place,"
6957,THE GRAVE.,"Offer'd in incense, can procure his pardon,"
6958,THE GRAVE.,"Or mitigate his doom. A mighty angel,"
6959,THE GRAVE.,"With flaming sword, forbids his longer stay,"
6960,THE GRAVE.,And drives the loiterer forth; nor must he take
6961,THE GRAVE.,One last and farewell round. At once he lost
6962,THE GRAVE.,"His glory and his God. If mortal now,                    580"
6963,THE GRAVE.,"And sorely maim'd, no wonder!--Man has sinn'd."
6964,THE GRAVE.,"Sick of his bliss, and bent on new adventures,"
6965,THE GRAVE.,Evil he needs would try: nor tried in vain.
6966,THE GRAVE.,(Dreadful experiment! destructive measure!
6967,THE GRAVE.,Where the worst thing could happen is success.)
6968,THE GRAVE.,Alas! too well he sped:--the good he scorn'd
6969,THE GRAVE.,"Stalk'd off reluctant, like an ill-used ghost,"
6970,THE GRAVE.,"Not to return; or if it did, its visits,"
6971,THE GRAVE.,"Like those of angels, short and far between:"
6972,THE GRAVE.,"Whilst the black Demon, with his hell-scaped train,      590"
6973,THE GRAVE.,"Admitted once into its better room,"
6974,THE GRAVE.,"Grew loud and mutinous, nor would be gone;"
6975,THE GRAVE.,Lording it o'er the man: who now too late
6976,THE GRAVE.,Saw the rash error which he could not mend:
6977,THE GRAVE.,"An error fatal not to him alone,"
6978,THE GRAVE.,"But to his future sons, his fortune's heirs."
6979,THE GRAVE.,Inglorious bondage! Human nature groans
6980,THE GRAVE.,"Beneath a vassalage so vile and cruel,"
6981,THE GRAVE.,And its vast body bleeds through every vein.
6982,THE GRAVE.,"What havoc hast thou made, foul monster, Sin!          600"
6983,THE GRAVE.,Greatest and first of ills: the fruitful parent
6984,THE GRAVE.,Of woes of all dimensions: but for thee
6985,THE GRAVE.,"Sorrow had never been,--All-noxious thing,"
6986,THE GRAVE.,Of vilest nature! Other sorts of evils
6987,THE GRAVE.,"Are kindly circumscribed, and have their bounds."
6988,THE GRAVE.,"The fierce volcano, from his burning entrails"
6989,THE GRAVE.,"That belches molten stone and globes of fire,"
6990,THE GRAVE.,"Involved in pitchy clouds of smoke and stench,"
6991,THE GRAVE.,"Mars the adjacent fields for some leagues round,"
6992,THE GRAVE.,"And there it stops. The big-swoln inundation,            610"
6993,THE GRAVE.,"Of mischief more diffusive, raving loud,"
6994,THE GRAVE.,"Buries whole tracts of country, threatening more;"
6995,THE GRAVE.,But that too has its shore it cannot pass.
6996,THE GRAVE.,"More dreadful far than these! Sin has laid waste,"
6997,THE GRAVE.,"Not here and there a country, but a world:"
6998,THE GRAVE.,"Despatching, at a wide-extended blow,"
6999,THE GRAVE.,Entire mankind; and for their sakes defacing
7000,THE GRAVE.,A whole creation's beauty with rude hands;
7001,THE GRAVE.,"Blasting the foodful grain, the loaded branches;"
7002,THE GRAVE.,And marking all along its way with ruin.                 620
7003,THE GRAVE.,Accursed thing!--Oh! where shall fancy find
7004,THE GRAVE.,"A proper name to call thee by, expressive"
7005,THE GRAVE.,Of all thy horrors?--Pregnant womb of ills!
7006,THE GRAVE.,"Of tempers so transcendantly malign,"
7007,THE GRAVE.,That toads and serpents of most deadly kind
7008,THE GRAVE.,Compared to thee are harmless.--Sicknesses
7009,THE GRAVE.,"Of every size and symptom, racking pains,"
7010,THE GRAVE.,"And bluest plagues, are thine.--See how the fiend"
7011,THE GRAVE.,Profusely scatters the contagion round!
7012,THE GRAVE.,"Whilst deep-mouth'd slaughter, bellowing at her heels,   630"
7013,THE GRAVE.,Wades deep in blood new-spilt; yet for to-morrow
7014,THE GRAVE.,"Shapes out new work of great uncommon daring,"
7015,THE GRAVE.,And inly pines till the dread blow is struck.
7016,THE GRAVE.,"But, hold! I've gone too far; too much discover'd"
7017,THE GRAVE.,"My father's nakedness, and nature's shame."
7018,THE GRAVE.,"Here let me pause, and drop an honest tear,"
7019,THE GRAVE.,"One burst of filial duty and condolence,"
7020,THE GRAVE.,"O'er all those ample deserts Death hath spread,"
7021,THE GRAVE.,This chaos of mankind.--O great man-eater!
7022,THE GRAVE.,"Whose every day is carnival, not sated yet!              640"
7023,THE GRAVE.,"Unheard-of epicure, without a fellow!"
7024,THE GRAVE.,The veriest gluttons do not always cram;
7025,THE GRAVE.,Some intervals of abstinence are sought
7026,THE GRAVE.,To edge the appetite: Thou seekest none.
7027,THE GRAVE.,"Methinks the countless swarms thou hast devour'd,"
7028,THE GRAVE.,"And thousands at each hour thou gobblest up,"
7029,THE GRAVE.,"This, less than this, might gorge thee to the full!"
7030,THE GRAVE.,"But, ah! rapacious still, thou gap'st for more:"
7031,THE GRAVE.,"Like one, whole days defrauded of his meals,"
7032,THE GRAVE.,"On whom lank Hunger lays her skinny hand,                650"
7033,THE GRAVE.,And whets to keenest eagerness his cravings:
7034,THE GRAVE.,"As if diseases, massacres, and poison,"
7035,THE GRAVE.,"Famine, and war, were not thy caterers."
7036,THE GRAVE.,"But know that thou must render up thy dead,"
7037,THE GRAVE.,"And with high interest too.--They are not thine,"
7038,THE GRAVE.,"But only in thy keeping for a season,"
7039,THE GRAVE.,Till the great promised day of restitution;
7040,THE GRAVE.,When loud-diffusive sound from brazen trump
7041,THE GRAVE.,"Of strong-lung'd cherub shall alarm thy captives,"
7042,THE GRAVE.,"And rouse the long, long sleepers into life,             660"
7043,THE GRAVE.,"Day-light, and liberty.--"
7044,THE GRAVE.,"Then must thy gates fly open, and reveal"
7045,THE GRAVE.,"The mines that lay long forming under ground,"
7046,THE GRAVE.,"In their dark cells immured; but now full ripe,"
7047,THE GRAVE.,"And pure as silver from the crucible,"
7048,THE GRAVE.,That twice has stood the torture of the fire
7049,THE GRAVE.,"And inquisition of the forge. We know,"
7050,THE GRAVE.,"The illustrious Deliverer of mankind,"
7051,THE GRAVE.,"The Son of God, thee foil'd. Him in thy power"
7052,THE GRAVE.,"Thou couldst not hold: self-vigorous he rose,            670"
7053,THE GRAVE.,"And, shaking off thy fetters, soon retook"
7054,THE GRAVE.,Those spoils his voluntary yielding lent:
7055,THE GRAVE.,(Sure pledge of our releasement from thy thrall!)
7056,THE GRAVE.,"Twice twenty days he sojourn'd here on earth,"
7057,THE GRAVE.,"And show'd himself alive to chosen witnesses,"
7058,THE GRAVE.,"By proofs so strong, that the most slow-assenting"
7059,THE GRAVE.,"Had not a scruple left. This having done,"
7060,THE GRAVE.,He mounted up to heaven. Methinks I see him
7061,THE GRAVE.,"Climb the aerial heights, and glide along"
7062,THE GRAVE.,"Athwart the severing clouds: but the faint eye,          680"
7063,THE GRAVE.,"Flung backwards in the chase, soon drops its hold;"
7064,THE GRAVE.,"Disabled quite, and jaded with pursuing."
7065,THE GRAVE.,Heaven's portals wide expand to let him in;
7066,THE GRAVE.,Nor are his friends shut out: as some great prince
7067,THE GRAVE.,"Not for himself alone procures admission,"
7068,THE GRAVE.,But for his train. It was his royal will
7069,THE GRAVE.,"That where he is, there should his followers be."
7070,THE GRAVE.,"Death only lies between: a gloomy path,"
7071,THE GRAVE.,Made yet more gloomy by our coward fears;
7072,THE GRAVE.,"But not untrod, nor tedious: the fatigue                 690"
7073,THE GRAVE.,"Will soon go off. Besides, there's no bye-road"
7074,THE GRAVE.,"To bliss. Then why, like ill-condition'd children,"
7075,THE GRAVE.,Start we at transient hardships in the way
7076,THE GRAVE.,"That leads to purer air, and softer skies,"
7077,THE GRAVE.,And a ne'er-setting sun?--Fools that we are!
7078,THE GRAVE.,We wish to be where sweets unwithering bloom;
7079,THE GRAVE.,"But straight our wish revoke, and will not go."
7080,THE GRAVE.,"So have I seen, upon a summer's even,"
7081,THE GRAVE.,Fast by the rivulet's brink a youngster play:
7082,THE GRAVE.,How wishfully he looks to stem the tide!                 700
7083,THE GRAVE.,"This moment resolute, next unresolved:"
7084,THE GRAVE.,"At last he dips his foot; but as he dips,"
7085,THE GRAVE.,"His fears redouble, and he runs away"
7086,THE GRAVE.,"From the inoffensive stream, unmindful now"
7087,THE GRAVE.,"Of all the flowers that paint the further bank,"
7088,THE GRAVE.,And smiled so sweet of late.--Thrice welcome death!
7089,THE GRAVE.,That after many a painful bleeding step
7090,THE GRAVE.,"Conducts us to our home, and lands us safe"
7091,THE GRAVE.,On the long-wish'd-for shore.--Prodigious change!
7092,THE GRAVE.,"Our bane turn'd to a blessing!--Death, disarm'd,         710"
7093,THE GRAVE.,Loses his fellness quite.--All thanks to him
7094,THE GRAVE.,Who scourged the venom out!--Sure the last end
7095,THE GRAVE.,Of the good man is peace!--How calm his exit!
7096,THE GRAVE.,"Night dews fall not more gently to the ground,"
7097,THE GRAVE.,"Nor weary, worn-out winds expire so soft."
7098,THE GRAVE.,"Behold him in the evening-tide of life,"
7099,THE GRAVE.,"A life well spent, whose early care it was"
7100,THE GRAVE.,His riper years should not upbraid his green:
7101,THE GRAVE.,By unperceived degrees he wears away;
7102,THE GRAVE.,"Yet, like the sun, seems larger at his setting.          720"
7103,THE GRAVE.,"High in his faith and hopes, look how he reaches"
7104,THE GRAVE.,"After the prize in view! and, like a bird"
7105,THE GRAVE.,"That's hamper'd, struggles hard to get away:"
7106,THE GRAVE.,Whilst the glad gates of sight are wide expanded
7107,THE GRAVE.,"To let new glories in, the first fair fruits"
7108,THE GRAVE.,"Of the fast-coming harvest.--Then, oh then!"
7109,THE GRAVE.,"Each earth-born joy grows vile, or disappears,"
7110,THE GRAVE.,Shrunk to a thing of nought.--Oh! how he longs
7111,THE GRAVE.,"To have his passport sign'd, and be dismiss'd!"
7112,THE GRAVE.,'Tis done! and now he's happy! The glad soul             730
7113,THE GRAVE.,Has not a wish uncrown'd.--Even the lag flesh
7114,THE GRAVE.,"Rests, too, in hope of meeting once again"
7115,THE GRAVE.,"Its better half, never to sunder more."
7116,THE GRAVE.,"Nor shall it hope in vain:--the time draws on,"
7117,THE GRAVE.,"When not a single spot of burial earth,"
7118,THE GRAVE.,"Whether on land, or in the spacious sea,"
7119,THE GRAVE.,But must give back its long-committed dust
7120,THE GRAVE.,Inviolate!--and faithfully shall these
7121,THE GRAVE.,Make up the full account; not the least atom
7122,THE GRAVE.,"Embezzled, or mislaid, of the whole tale.                740"
7123,THE GRAVE.,Each soul shall have a body ready furnish'd;
7124,THE GRAVE.,"And each shall have his own.--Hence, ye profane!"
7125,THE GRAVE.,Ask not how this can be?--Sure the same power
7126,THE GRAVE.,"That rear'd the piece at first, and took it down,"
7127,THE GRAVE.,"Can re-assemble the loose scatter'd parts,"
7128,THE GRAVE.,And put them as they were.--Almighty God
7129,THE GRAVE.,Has done much more; nor is his arm impair'd
7130,THE GRAVE.,"Through length of days: and what he can, he will:"
7131,THE GRAVE.,His faithfulness stands bound to see it done.
7132,THE GRAVE.,"When the dread trumpet sounds, the slumbering dust,      750"
7133,THE GRAVE.,"Not unattentive to the call, shall wake;"
7134,THE GRAVE.,"And every joint possess its proper place,"
7135,THE GRAVE.,"With a new elegance of form, unknown"
7136,THE GRAVE.,To its first state. Nor shall the conscious soul
7137,THE GRAVE.,"Mistake its partner, but, amidst the crowd,"
7138,THE GRAVE.,"Singling its other half, into its arms"
7139,THE GRAVE.,"Shall rush, with all the impatience of a man"
7140,THE GRAVE.,"That's new come home; and, having long been absent,"
7141,THE GRAVE.,"With haste runs over every different room,"
7142,THE GRAVE.,In pain to see the whole. Thrice happy meeting!          760

7355,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"prose, the 'poetry' of their calling,--namely, Cooper and Falconer, both"
7356,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"of whose descriptions of sea storms and scenery have been equalled, if"
7357,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"not surpassed, however, by such landsmen as Byron and Scott. A poetic"
7358,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"mind, which comes in contact with strange and wonderful events or"
7359,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"scenery only at intervals, often carries away a much more vivid idea of"
7360,WILLIAM FALCONER.,their striking features than those who reside constantly in their midst.
7361,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"It must be a very rough rope, to borrow an image from the theme, which"
7362,WILLIAM FALCONER.,does not feel softer after long handling. It is the short and sudden
7363,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"impression, made in the twinkling of an eye, which is at once the most"
7364,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"lively and the most lasting. When, however, enthusiasm continues, as in"
7365,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"some favoured cases, unabated by familiarity, and is united to thorough"
7366,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"technical knowledge, then the professional man may be nearly as"
7367,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"successful as the amateur, or if there be any deficiency in freshness of"
7368,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"feeling, it is made up for by accuracy of knowledge. It was so in the"
7369,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"case of James Hogg, the poet of the shepherd life of Southern Scotland,"
7370,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"and in William Falconer, the poet of British shipwreck. We shall"
7371,WILLIAM FALCONER.,afterwards show how his knowledge of his profession partly helped and
7372,WILLIAM FALCONER.,partly hindered him in his poem.
7373,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7374,WILLIAM FALCONER.,William Falconer was born in Edinburgh in the year 1736. He was the son
7375,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"of a poor barber in the Netherbow, who had two other children, both deaf"
7376,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"and dumb, who ended their days in a poor-house. He early, through"
7377,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"frequent visits to Leith, came in contact with that tremendous element"
7378,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"which he was to sing so powerfully, and in which he was to sink at"
7379,WILLIAM FALCONER.,last--which was to give him at once his glory and his grave. While a
7380,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"mere boy, he went, by his own account, reluctantly on board a Leith"
7381,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"merchant ship, and was afterwards in the Royal Navy. Of his early"
7382,WILLIAM FALCONER.,education or habits very little is known. He had all his scholarship
7383,WILLIAM FALCONER.,from one Webster. We figure him (after the similitude of a dear lost
7384,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"sailor boy, a relative of our own) as a stripling, with curling hair,"
7385,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"ruddy cheek, form prematurely developed into round robustness, frank,"
7386,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"free, and manly bearing, returning ever and anon from his ocean"
7387,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"wanderings, and bearing to his friends some rare bird or shell of the"
7388,WILLIAM FALCONER.,tropics as a memorial of his labours and his love. Before he was
7389,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"eighteen years of age, Providence supplied him with the materials whence"
7390,WILLIAM FALCONER.,he was to pile up the monument of his future fame. He became second mate
7391,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"in the ship 'Britannia', a vessel trading in the Levant. This vessel was"
7392,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"shipwrecked off Cape Colonna, exactly in the manner described in the"
7393,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"poem, which is just a coloured photograph of the adventures,"
7394,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"difficulties, dangers, and disastrous result of the voyage. In 1751 we"
7395,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"find him living in Edinburgh, and publishing his first poem. This was an"
7396,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"elegy on the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales. It was followed by"
7397,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"other pieces, which appeared in the 'Gentleman's Magazine', and which"
7398,WILLIAM FALCONER.,will be found in this volume. Some have claimed for him the authorship
7399,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"of the favourite sea song, ""Cease, Rude Boreas,"" but this seems"
7400,WILLIAM FALCONER.,uncertain.
7401,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7402,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Falconer is supposed to have continued in the merchant service (one of
7403,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"his biographers maintains that he was for some time in the 'Ramilies', a"
7404,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"man-of-war, which suffered shipwreck in the Channel) till 1762, when he"
7405,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"published his ""Shipwreck."" This poem was dedicated to the Duke of York,"
7406,WILLIAM FALCONER.,who had newly become Rear-Admiral of the Blue on board the 'Princess
7407,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Amelia', attached to the fleet under Sir Edward Hawke. The Duke was not"
7408,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"a Solomon, but he had sense enough to perceive, that the sailor who"
7409,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"could produce such a poem was no ordinary man, and generous enough to"
7410,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"offer him promotion, if he should leave the merchant service for the"
7411,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Royal Navy. Falconer, accordingly, was promoted to be a midshipman on"
7412,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"board the 'Royal George' (Sir Edward Hawke's ship); the same, we"
7413,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"believe, which afterwards went down in such a disastrous manner, and"
7414,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"furnished a subject for one of Cowper's boldest little poems. ""The"
7415,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Shipwreck"" was highly commended by the 'Monthly Review',--then the"
7416,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"leading literary organ,--and became widely popular."
7417,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7418,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"While in the 'Royal George', Falconer contrived to find time for his"
7419,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"poetical studies. Retiring sometimes from his messmates, into a small"
7420,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"space between the cable-trees and the ship's side, he wrote his Ode on"
7421,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""the Duke of York's Second Departure from England, as Rear-Admiral."""
7422,WILLIAM FALCONER.,This poem was severely criticised in the 'Critical Review'. It has
7423,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"certainly much pomp, and thundering sound of language and versification,"
7424,WILLIAM FALCONER.,but wants the genuine Pindaric inspiration.
7425,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7426,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"At the peace of 1763 the 'Royal George' was paid off, and Falconer"
7427,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"became purser of the 'Glory', frigate of 32 guns. About this time he"
7428,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"married a young lady named Hicks, daughter of a surgeon in"
7429,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Sheerness-yard--a lady more distinguished by her mental than her
7430,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"physical qualities. The poet dubbed her in his verses, ""Miranda."" It is"
7431,WILLIAM FALCONER.,hinted that he had some difficulty in procuring her consent to marry
7432,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"him, and was forced to lay regular siege to her in rhyme. At length she"
7433,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"capitulated, and the marriage was eminently happy. She survived her"
7434,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"husband many years; lived at Bath, and enjoyed a comfortable livelihood"
7435,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"on the proceeds of her husband's ""Marine Dictionary."""
7436,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7437,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"When the 'Glory' was laid up at Chatham, Commissioner Hanway, brother of"
7438,WILLIAM FALCONER.,the once celebrated Jonas Hanway (whom Dr Johnson so justly chastised
7439,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"for his diatribe against Tea), showed much interest in the pursuits and"
7440,WILLIAM FALCONER.,person of our poet. He even ordered the captain's cabin to be fitted up
7441,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"with every comfort, that Falconer might pursue his studies without"
7442,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"expense, and with all convenience. Here he brought his ""Marine"
7443,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Dictionary"" to a conclusion--a work which had occupied him for years,"
7444,WILLIAM FALCONER.,and which supplied a desideratum in the literature of the profession.
7445,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"The design had been suggested by one Scott, and approved of by Sir"
7446,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Edward Hawke; and the book, when it appeared in 1769, was greatly"
7447,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"commended by Dr Hamel, the Frenchman, who had gained note himself, by"
7448,WILLIAM FALCONER.,producing some works on naval architecture. From the 'Glory' Falconer
7449,WILLIAM FALCONER.,received an appointment in the 'Swift-sure'. In 1764 he issued a new
7450,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"edition of ""The Shipwreck,"" carefully corrected, and with considerable"
7451,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"additions. The next year he issued a political poem, in which, like a"
7452,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"true tar of the 'Royal George', he took the King's side, and emitted"
7453,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"much dull and drivelling bile against Lord Chatham, Wilkes, and"
7454,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Churchill. The satire proved that, though at home on the ocean, he was"
7455,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"utterly ""at sea"" in land-politics."
7456,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7457,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Falconer had now left his cabin study with its many pleasant
7458,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"accommodations, and become a scribbler of all work in a London garret."
7459,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Here his existence ran on for a while in an obscure and probably
7460,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"miserable current. It is said that Murray, the bookseller, the father of"
7461,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"'the' John Murray, of Albemarle Street, wished to take the poet into"
7462,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"partnership,--upon terms of great advantage,--but that Falconer, for"
7463,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"reasons which are not known, declined the offer. ""My Murray,"" as Byron"
7464,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"calls him, was destined instead to have his name connected with a"
7465,WILLIAM FALCONER.,grander and ghastlier shipwreck than it lay in the brain of the
7466,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"projected partner of his firm to conceive, or in his genius to"
7467,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"execute--that, namely, described in the ever-detestable, yet"
7468,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"ever-memorable, second canto of ""Don Juan."""
7469,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7470,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"In 1769, a third edition of his poem was called for, and he was employed"
7471,WILLIAM FALCONER.,in making improvements and additions when he was again summoned to sea.
7472,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"In his hurry of departure, he is said to have committed these to the"
7473,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"care of the notorious David Mallett, the son of a Crieff innkeeper, the"
7474,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"friend of Thomson, the biographer of Bacon, and, as Johnson called him,"
7475,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the ""beggarly Scotchman, who drew the trigger of Bolingbroke's"
7476,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"blunderbuss of infidelity,"" who seems to have paid no manner of"
7477,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"attention to his trust, as mistakes in the nautical terms and a frequent"
7478,WILLIAM FALCONER.,inferiority in execution manifest.
7479,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7480,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Falconer had undoubtedly thought the sea a hard and sickening
7481,WILLIAM FALCONER.,profession; but latterly found that writing for the booksellers was a
7482,WILLIAM FALCONER.,slavery still more abject and unendurable. He resolved once more to
7483,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"embark upon the ""melancholy main."" Often as he had hugged its horrors,"
7484,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"laid his hand on its mane, and narrowly escaped its devouring jaws, he"
7485,WILLIAM FALCONER.,was drawn in again as by the fatal suction of a whirlpool into its
7486,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"power. Perhaps he had imbibed a passion for the sea. At all events, he"
7487,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"accepted the office of purser to the Aurora frigate, which was going out"
7488,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"to India, and on the 30th of September 1769, he left England for ever."
7489,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"The Aurora was never heard of more! Some vague rumours, indeed,"
7490,WILLIAM FALCONER.,prevailed of a contradictory character--that she had been burned--that
7491,WILLIAM FALCONER.,she had foundered in the Mozambique Channel--that she had been cast away
7492,WILLIAM FALCONER.,on a reef of rocks near Macao--that five persons had been saved from her
7493,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"wreck, but nothing certain transpired, except that she was lost; and"
7494,WILLIAM FALCONER.,this fine singer of the sea along with her. Unfortunate Aurora! dawn
7495,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"soon overcast! Unfortunate poet, so speedily removed!"
7496,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7497,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""It was that fatal and perfidious bark,"
7498,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Built i' the eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,"
7499,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"That laid so low that sacred head of thine."""
7500,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7501,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"The drowning of one poet of far loftier genius in the Bay of Spezia,"
7502,WILLIAM FALCONER.,latterly proved that the offering up of Falconer's life had not fully
7503,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"appeased the wrath of old Neptune, and that bards may still entertain,"
7504,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"in the lines of Wordsworth,"
7505,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7506,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""Of the old sea some reverential fear."""
7507,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7508,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Burns heard of and deplored the loss of the Poet of the Shipwreck. In
7509,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"one of his letters to Mrs Dunlop, he mentions the fact, and adds the"
7510,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"beautiful words, ""He was one of those daring, adventurous spirits which"
7511,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Scotland beyond any other country is remarkable for producing. Little
7512,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"does the fond mother think, as she hangs delighted over the sweet little"
7513,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"leech at her bosom, where the poor fellow may hereafter wander, and what"
7514,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"may be his fate. I remember a stanza in an old Scottish ballad, which"
7515,WILLIAM FALCONER.,speaks feelingly to the heart--
7516,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7517,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"'Little did my mother think,"
7518,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"That day she cradled me,"
7519,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"What land I was to travel on,"
7520,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Or what death I should die.'"""
7521,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7522,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Falconer is represented as a bluff, blunt, but cheerful sailor--fond of"
7523,WILLIAM FALCONER.,amusing his shipmates with acrostics on the names of their
7524,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"mistresses--with little learning except in seamanship, and what he had"
7525,WILLIAM FALCONER.,picked up in his travels. His smaller pieces scarcely deserve criticsm.
7526,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"His whole reputation now reposes on the one pillar of his one poem, ""The"
7527,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Shipwreck."""
7528,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7529,WILLIAM FALCONER.,This poem was greatly overrated when it first appeared. It was by some
7530,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"critics preferred to Virgil's ""Æneid,"" and compared to the ""Odyssey."" It"
7531,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"is now, we think, as unjustly depreciated. That there is a good deal of"
7532,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"swollen commonplace in the diction and sentiments, must be admitted."
7533,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Falconer arose in a bad age in respect of poetry. The terseness of Pope
7534,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"was gone, and in his imitators only his tinkle remained. His exquisite"
7535,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"sense and trembling finish had vanished, and only his conventional"
7536,WILLIAM FALCONER.,diction--the ghost of his greatness--was to be found in the poets of the
7537,WILLIAM FALCONER.,time. It was extremely natural that a half-taught mind like Falconer's
7538,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"should be captivated by what was the mode of the day. Indeed, Burns"
7539,WILLIAM FALCONER.,himself was only saved from the same error by continuing to write in
7540,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Scotch; many of his English verses and his letters are marred by more or
7541,WILLIAM FALCONER.,less of the disgusting and vicious affectation of style which then
7542,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"prevailed; and in parts of Campbell's ""Pleasures of Hope,"" we find the"
7543,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"last modified specimen of the evil. Hence, in Falconer the obsolete"
7544,WILLIAM FALCONER.,mythological allusions--the names with classical terminations--the
7545,WILLIAM FALCONER.,perpetual apostrophes--the set and stilted speeches he puts into the
7546,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"mouths of heroes--the bombast, verbiage, and sounding sameness of much"
7547,WILLIAM FALCONER.,of his verse. Nor do we greatly admire the story which he introduces
7548,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"with the poem, nor the discrimination of his characters, nor, what may"
7549,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"be called strictly, the pathos of the piece. Indeed, considering the"
7550,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"size of the poem, there is so much that is vapid and common, that the"
7551,WILLIAM FALCONER.,counter-balancing excellences must be great ere they could have floated
7552,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"it so long. To use an expression suitable to the theme, the vessel which"
7553,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"has sailed so far, notwithstanding its numerous leaks, must be of a"
7554,WILLIAM FALCONER.,strong and sturdy build.
7555,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7556,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And this is the main merit of ""The Shipwreck."" It has in most of its"
7557,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"descriptive passages a certain rugged strength and truth, which prove at"
7558,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"once the perspicacity and the poetic vision of the author, who, while he"
7559,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"sees all the minute details of his subject, sees also the glory of"
7560,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"imagination shining around them. A ship appears before his view, with"
7561,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"its every spar and yard, clear and distinct as if seen in meridian"
7562,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"sunshine, and yet with a radiance of poetry around it all, as if he were"
7563,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"looking at it by moonlight, or in the magical light of a dream. Take the"
7564,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"following lines, for instance:--"
7565,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7566,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""Up-torn reluctant from its oozy cave,"
7567,WILLIAM FALCONER.,The ponderous anchor rises o'er the wave.
7568,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"High on the slipp'ry masts the yards ascend,"
7569,WILLIAM FALCONER.,And far abroad the canvas wings extend.
7570,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Along the glassy plain the vessel glides,"
7571,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"While azure radiance trembles on her sides."""
7572,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7573,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7574,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"We grant, indeed, that sometimes his technical lore rises up, as it"
7575,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"were, and drowns the poetry. What imaginative quality, for example, have"
7576,WILLIAM FALCONER.,we in the following verses?
7577,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7578,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""The mainsail, by the squall so lately rent,"
7579,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"In streaming pendants flying, is unbent;"
7580,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"With brails refixed, another soon prepared,"
7581,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Ascending spreads along beneath the yard;
7582,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"To each yard-arm the head-rope they extend,"
7583,WILLIAM FALCONER.,And soon their ear-rings and their robans bend.
7584,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"That task perform'd, they first the braces slack,"
7585,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Then to the chess-tree drag the unwilling tack;
7586,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And, while the lee clue-garnet's lower'd away,"
7587,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Taught aft the sheet they tally, and belay."""
7588,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7589,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7590,WILLIAM FALCONER.,This is mere log-book; and such passages are common in the poem. But
7591,WILLIAM FALCONER.,frequently he bathes the web of the shrouds and ship-rigging in rich
7592,WILLIAM FALCONER.,ideal gold. Take the following:--
7593,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7594,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""With equal sheets restrain'd, the bellying sail"
7595,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Spreads a broad concave to the sweeping gale;
7596,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"While o'er the foam the ship impetuous flies,"
7597,WILLIAM FALCONER.,The helm the attentive timoneer applies:
7598,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"As in pursuit along the aerial way,"
7599,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"With ardent eye the falcon marks his prey,"
7600,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Each motion watches of the doubtful chase,"
7601,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Obliquely wheeling through the fluid space;
7602,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"So, govern'd by the steersman's GLOWING hands,"
7603,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"The regent helm her motion still commands."""
7604,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7605,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7606,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Falconer may in some points be likened to Crabbe. Like him, he excels in"
7607,WILLIAM FALCONER.,minute and patient painting. Like him he is capable at times of
7608,WILLIAM FALCONER.,extracting the imaginative element from the barest and simplest details.
7609,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And, like him, he sometimes sets before us, mere dry inventories or"
7610,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"invoices, instead of such poetical catalogues as Homer gives of ships,"
7611,WILLIAM FALCONER.,and Milton of devils. It is remarkable that Falconer never shines at all
7612,WILLIAM FALCONER.,except when he is describing ships or sea scenery.
7613,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7614,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""His path is on the mountain waves,"
7615,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"His home is on the deep."""
7616,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7617,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7618,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"No words in Scripture are so strange to him as these, ""There shall be no"
7619,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"more sea."" The course of his voyage in the Shipwreck, brings him past"
7620,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"lands the most famous in the ancient world for arts and arms, for"
7621,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"philosophy, patriotism, and poetry. And sore does he labour to lash"
7622,WILLIAM FALCONER.,himself into inspiration as he apostrophizes them; but in vain--the
7623,WILLIAM FALCONER.,result is little else than furious feebleness and stilted bombast. But
7624,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"when he returns to the element, the impatient, irregular, changeful,"
7625,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"treacherous, terrible ocean--and watches the night, winged with black"
7626,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"storm and red lightning, sinking down over the Mediterranean, and the"
7627,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"devoted bark which is helplessly struggling with its billows, then his"
7628,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"blood rises, his verse heaves, and hurries on, and you see the full-born"
7629,WILLIAM FALCONER.,poet--
7630,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7631,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""High o'er the poop the audacious seas aspire,"
7632,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Uproll'd in hills of fluctuating fire:
7633,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"With labouring throes she rolls on either side,"
7634,WILLIAM FALCONER.,And dips her gunnells in the yawning tide.
7635,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Her joints unhinged in palsied langour play,"
7636,WILLIAM FALCONER.,As ice-flakes part beneath the noontide ray;
7637,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"The gale howls doleful through the blocks and shrouds,"
7638,WILLIAM FALCONER.,And big rain pours a deluge from the clouds.
7639,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"From wintry magazines that sweep the sky,"
7640,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Descending globes of hail incessant fly;
7641,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"High on the masts with pale and lurid rays,"
7642,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Amid the gloom portentous meteors blaze!
7643,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"The ethereal dome in mournful pomp array'd,"
7644,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Now buried lies beneath impervious shade,--"
7645,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Now flashing round intolerable light,"
7646,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Redoubles all the horrors of the night.
7647,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Such terror Sinai's trembling hill o'erspread,"
7648,WILLIAM FALCONER.,When Heaven's loud trumpet sounded o'er its head.
7649,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"It seem'd the wrathful angel of the wind,"
7650,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Had all the horrors of the skies combined;
7651,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And here to one ill-fated ship opposed,"
7652,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"At once the dreadful magazine disclosed."""
7653,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7654,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"This is noble writing. ""Deep calleth unto deep."" It reminds us of Pope's"
7655,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"translation of that tremendous passage in the 8th Book of the Iliad,"
7656,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"where Jove comes forth, and darts his angry lightnings in the eyes of"
7657,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the Grecians, and repels and appals their mightiest; Nestor alone, but"
7658,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"with his horse wounded by the dart of Paris, sustaining the divine"
7659,WILLIAM FALCONER.,assault.
7660,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7661,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Lord Byron, in his letter to Bowles in defence of Pope, alludes to"
7662,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Falconer's Shipwreck, and cites it in proof of the poetical use which"
7663,WILLIAM FALCONER.,may be made of the works of art. But it has justly been remarked by
7664,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Hazlitt, in his very masterly reply, published in the 'London Magazine',"
7665,WILLIAM FALCONER.,that the finest parts of the Shipwreck are not those in which he appears
7666,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"to versify parts of his own Marine Dictionary, or in which he makes vain"
7667,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"efforts to describe the vestiges of Grecian grandeur, but those in"
7668,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"which, as in the above passage, he mates with the sublime and terrible"
7669,WILLIAM FALCONER.,'natural' phenomena he meets in his voyage--the gathering of the
7670,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"storm--the treacherous lull of the sea, breathing itself like a tiger"
7671,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"for its fatal spring--the ship, now walking the calm waters of the"
7672,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"glassy sea, and now wrestling like a demon of kindred power and fury"
7673,WILLIAM FALCONER.,with the angry billows--the last fearful onset of the maddened
7674,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"surge--and the secret stab given by the assassin rock from below, which"
7675,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"completes the ruin of the doomed vessel, and scatters its fragments o'er"
7676,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the tide, growling in joy--these, as the poet describes them, constitute"
7677,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the poetical glory of ""The Shipwreck,"" and these have little connexion"
7678,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"with art, and much with nature."
7679,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7680,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Lord Byron was better at emulating than at criticising Falconer's
7681,WILLIAM FALCONER.,'chef-d'oeuvre'. We have already once or twice alluded to 'his'
7682,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Shipwreck--surely the grandest and most characteristic effort of his
7683,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"genius, in its demoniac force, and demoniac spirit. As we have elsewhere"
7684,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"said, ""he describes the horrors of a shipwreck, like a fiend who had,"
7685,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"invisible, sat amid the shrouds, choked with laughter--with immeasurable"
7686,WILLIAM FALCONER.,glee had heard the wild farewell rising from sea to sky--had leaped into
7687,WILLIAM FALCONER.,the long-boat as it put off with its pale crew--had gloated o'er the
7688,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"cannibal repast--had leered, unseen, into the 'dim eyes of those"
7689,WILLIAM FALCONER.,shipwreck'd men'--and with a loud and savage burst of derision had seen
7690,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"them at length sinking into the waves."" The superiority of his picture"
7691,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"over Falconer's, lies in the simplicity and strength of the style, in"
7692,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the ease of the narrative, in the variety of the incidents and"
7693,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"characters, and in certain short masterly touches, now of pathos, now of"
7694,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"infernal humour, and now of description, competent only to Byron and to"
7695,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Shakspeare. Such are,--"
7696,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7697,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7698,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""Then shriek'd the timid and stood still the brave."""
7699,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""The bubbling cry"
7700,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Of some strong swimmer in his agony."""
7701,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""For he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,"
7702,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Two things to dying people quite bewildering,""--"
7703,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7704,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7705,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"and the inimitable description of the rainbow, closing with,--"
7706,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7707,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7708,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""Then changed like to a bow that's bent, and then--"
7709,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men."""
7710,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7711,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7712,WILLIAM FALCONER.,The technicalities introduced are fewer; and are handled with greater
7713,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"force, and made to tell more on the general effect. You marvel, too, at"
7714,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the versatility of the writer, who seems this moment to be looking at"
7715,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the scene with the eye of the melancholy Jacques; the next, with the"
7716,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"philosophical aspect of the moralizing Hamlet; the next, with the rage"
7717,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"of a misanthropical Timon; and the next, with the bitter sneer of a"
7718,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"malignant Iago: and yet, who, amidst all these disguises, leaves on you"
7719,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the impression that he is throughout acting the part, and displaying the"
7720,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"spirit, of a demon--a deep current of mockery at man's miseries, and at"
7721,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"God's providence, running under all his moods and imitations. We read it"
7722,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"once, when recovering from an illness, and shall never forget the"
7723,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"withering horror, and the shock of disgust and loathing, which it gave"
7724,WILLIAM FALCONER.,to our weakened nerves.
7725,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7726,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Since Falconer's time, besides Byron, Scott, in the Pirate, and Cooper,"
7727,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"there has not, as we hinted, been much of the poetical extracted from"
7728,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"the sea. The subject suggested in Boswell's Johnson, by General"
7729,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Oglethorpe, as a noble theme for a poem--namely, ""The Mediterranean,"" is"
7730,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"still unsung, at least by any competent bard. Mrs Hemans has one sweet"
7731,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"strain on the ""Treasures of the Deep."" Allan Cunningham's ""Wet Sheet and"
7732,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Flowing Sea,"" and Barry Cornwall's ""The Sea, the Sea,"" are in"
7733,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"everybody's mouth. We remember a young student at Glasgow College, long"
7734,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"since dead--George Gray by name--a thin lame lad, with dark mild eyes,"
7735,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"and a fine spiritual expression on his pale face, handing in to"
7736,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Professor Milne of the Moral Philosophy class, some lines which he read"
7737,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"to his class, and by which they, as well as the old, arid, although"
7738,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"profound and ingenious philosopher, were perfectly electrified. We shall"
7739,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"quote all we remember of them, and it will be thought much, when we"
7740,WILLIAM FALCONER.,state that twenty-five years have elapsed since we read them. They
7741,WILLIAM FALCONER.,began--
7742,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7743,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7744,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"""The storm is up; the anchor spring,"
7745,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And man the sails, my merry men;"
7746,WILLIAM FALCONER.,I must not lose the carolling
7747,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Of ocean in a hurricane;
7748,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"My soul mates with the mountain storm,"
7749,WILLIAM FALCONER.,The cooing gale disdains.
7750,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Bring Ocean in his wildest form,"
7751,WILLIAM FALCONER.,All booming thunder-strains;
7752,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"I'll bid him welcome, clap his mane;"
7753,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"I'll dip my temples in his yeast,"
7754,WILLIAM FALCONER.,And hug his breakers to my breast;
7755,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And bid them hail! all hail, I cry,"
7756,WILLIAM FALCONER.,My younger brethren hail!
7757,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7758,WILLIAM FALCONER.,The sea shall be my cemetery
7759,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Unto eternity.
7760,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7761,WILLIAM FALCONER.,How glorious 'tis to have the wave
7762,WILLIAM FALCONER.,For ever dashing o'er thee;--
7763,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Besides that dull and lonesome grave,"
7764,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Where worms and earth devour thee.
7765,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7766,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"My messmates, when ye drink my dirge,"
7767,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"Go, fill the cup from ocean's surge;"
7768,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"And when ye drain the beverage up,"
7769,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Remember Neptune in the cup.
7770,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"For he has been my _brawling host_,"
7771,WILLIAM FALCONER.,Since first I roam'd from coast to coast;
7772,WILLIAM FALCONER.,And he my _brawling_ host shall be--
7773,WILLIAM FALCONER.,I love his ocean courtesy--
7774,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"His _boisterous_ hospitality."""
7775,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7776,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7777,WILLIAM FALCONER.,
7778,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"These lines, to us at least, seem to echo the rough roar of the"
7779,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"breakers, as they rush upon an iron-bound coast. Poor G. Gray! He now"
7780,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"sleeps, not in the bosom of that old Ocean he loved so dearly, but, we"
7781,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"think, in the kirkyard of Douglas, in the Upper Ward of Lanarkshire,--a"
7782,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"light early quenched,--but whose memory this notice and these lines may,"
7783,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"perhaps, for a season, preserve! The SEA still lies over, after all"
7784,WILLIAM FALCONER.,"written in prose or rhyme regarding it, as the subject for a great poem;"
7785,WILLIAM FALCONER.,and it will task all the energies of even the truest poet.

8027,THE ARGUMENT.,Once breathed sweet influence on the happy plain:
8028,THE ARGUMENT.,"While o'er the lawn, with dance and festive song,"
8029,THE ARGUMENT.,Young Pleasure led the jocund hours along:
8030,THE ARGUMENT.,In gay luxuriance Ceres too was seen

8189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both, in lamenting numbers, o'er the deep"
8190,THE ARGUMENT.,With conscious anguish taught the harp to weep;
8191,THE ARGUMENT.,And both the raging surge in safety bore                 220

8211,THE ARGUMENT.,"Graceful of form, by nature taught to please,          240"
8212,THE ARGUMENT.,Of power to melt the female breast with ease;

8218,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet ever firm to honour's sacred cause;
8219,THE ARGUMENT.,"O'erjoy'd he saw her lovely eyes relent,"
8220,THE ARGUMENT.,The blushing maiden smiled with sweet consent.
8221,THE ARGUMENT.,Oft in the mazes of a neighbouring grove                 250
8222,THE ARGUMENT.,Unheard they breathed alternate vows of love:
8223,THE ARGUMENT.,"By fond society their passion grew,"
8224,THE ARGUMENT.,Like the young blossom fed with vernal dew;

8233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too well, fair youth! thy liberal heart he knew,"
8234,THE ARGUMENT.,A heart to nature's warm impressions true:
8235,THE ARGUMENT.,Full oft his wisdom strove with fruitless toil
8236,THE ARGUMENT.,With avarice to pollute that generous soil:
8237,THE ARGUMENT.,"That soil, impregnated with nobler seed,"
8238,THE ARGUMENT.,Refused the culture of so rank a weed.
8239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Elate with wealth in active commerce won,"
8240,THE ARGUMENT.,And basking in the smile of fortune's sun;

8251,THE ARGUMENT.,Oft led the youth where circling joys delight            280
8252,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ravish'd sense, or beauty charms the sight."
8253,THE ARGUMENT.,"With all her powers enchanting music fail'd,"

8256,THE ARGUMENT.,To quench the ethereal flame of ardent love.
8257,THE ARGUMENT.,"The merchant, kindling then with proud disdain,"
8258,THE ARGUMENT.,In look and voice assumed a harsher strain.
8259,THE ARGUMENT.,In absence now his only hope remain'd;
8260,THE ARGUMENT.,And such the stern decree his will ordain'd:
8261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep anguish, while Palemon heard his doom,              290"
8262,THE ARGUMENT.,Drew o'er his lovely face a saddening gloom;
8263,THE ARGUMENT.,"High beat his heart, fast flow'd the unbidden tear,"

8272,THE ARGUMENT.,Still Anna's image swims before his sight
8273,THE ARGUMENT.,In fleeting vision through the restless night;
8274,THE ARGUMENT.,"From clime to clime an exile doom'd to roam,"
8275,THE ARGUMENT.,His heart still panted for its secret home.
8276,THE ARGUMENT.,"The moon had circled twice her wayward zone,"
8277,THE ARGUMENT.,To him since young Arion first was known;
8278,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, wandering here through many a scene renown'd,"
8279,THE ARGUMENT.,In Alexandria's port the vessel found;
8280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, anxious to review his native shore,"
8281,THE ARGUMENT.,He on the roaring wave embark'd once more.               310
8282,THE ARGUMENT.,Oft by pale Cynthia's melancholy light
8283,THE ARGUMENT.,"With him Palemon kept the watch of night,"
8284,THE ARGUMENT.,In whose sad bosom many a sigh suppress'd
8285,THE ARGUMENT.,Some painful secret of the soul confess'd:
8286,THE ARGUMENT.,"Perhaps Arion soon the cause divined,"
8287,THE ARGUMENT.,Though shunning still to probe a wounded mind;
8288,THE ARGUMENT.,"He felt the chastity of silent woe,"
8289,THE ARGUMENT.,Though glad the balm of comfort to bestow.

8291,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tales of hapless love in ancient lore,               320"
8292,THE ARGUMENT.,Recall'd to memory by the adjacent shore:
8293,THE ARGUMENT.,"The scene thus present, and its story known,"
8294,THE ARGUMENT.,The lover sigh'd for sorrows not his own.
8295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, though a recent date their friendship bore,"
8296,THE ARGUMENT.,Soon the ripe metal own'd the quickening ore;
8297,THE ARGUMENT.,"For in one tide their passions seem'd to roll,"
8298,THE ARGUMENT.,By kindred age and sympathy of soul.
8299,THE ARGUMENT.,"These o'er the inferior naval train preside,"
8300,THE ARGUMENT.,"The course determine, or the commerce guide:"

8302,THE ARGUMENT.,Her wing of deepest shade oblivion drew.
8303,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sullen languor still the skies oppress'd,"
8304,THE ARGUMENT.,And held the unwilling ship in strong arrest:
8305,THE ARGUMENT.,"High in his chariot glow'd the lamp of day,"
8306,THE ARGUMENT.,O'er Ida flaming with meridian ray;
8307,THE ARGUMENT.,"Relax'd from toil the sailors range the shore,"
8308,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where famine, war, and storm are felt no more;"

8317,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lo! the shore with mournful prospects crown'd, [2]"
8318,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rampart torn with many a fatal wound,"
8319,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ruin'd bulwark tottering o'er the strand,"
8320,THE ARGUMENT.,Bewail the stroke of war's tremendous hand:
8321,THE ARGUMENT.,What scenes of woe this hapless isle o'erspread!         350
8322,THE ARGUMENT.,Where late thrice fifty thousand warriors bled.
8323,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full twice twelve summers were yon towers assail'd,"
8324,THE ARGUMENT.,Till barbarous Ottoman at last prevail'd;

8326,THE ARGUMENT.,"While heroes fell, and domes and temples burn'd."
8327,THE ARGUMENT.,"III.  But now before them happier scenes arise,"
8328,THE ARGUMENT.,Elysian vales salute their ravish'd eyes;
8329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Olive and cedar form'd a grateful shade,"
8330,THE ARGUMENT.,Where light with gay romantic error stray'd:
8331,THE ARGUMENT.,"The myrtles here with fond caresses twine,               360"
8332,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, rich with nectar, melts the pregnant vine"

8335,THE ARGUMENT.,"On mossy banks, beneath the citron grove,"
8336,THE ARGUMENT.,The youthful wanderers found a wild alcove;
8337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soft o'er the fairy region languor stole,"
8338,THE ARGUMENT.,And with sweet melancholy charm'd the soul.
8339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here first Palemon, while his pensive mind"
8340,THE ARGUMENT.,"For consolation on his friend reclined,"
8341,THE ARGUMENT.,In pity's bleeding bosom pour'd the stream               370
8342,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of love's soft anguish, and of grief supreme:"
8343,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Too true thy words! by sweet remembrance taught,"
8344,THE ARGUMENT.,My heart in secret bleeds with tender thought;
8345,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain it courts the solitary shade,"
8346,THE ARGUMENT.,"By every action, every look betray'd:"
8347,THE ARGUMENT.,The pride of generous woe disdains appeal
8348,THE ARGUMENT.,To hearts that unrelenting frosts congeal;
8349,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet sure, if right Palemon can divine,"
8350,THE ARGUMENT.,The sense of gentle pity dwells in thine:
8351,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yes! all his cares thy sympathy shall know,              380"
8352,THE ARGUMENT.,And prove the kind companion of his woe.
8353,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Albert thou know'st with skill and science graced,"

8371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not fairer grows the lily of the vale,                   400"
8372,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose bosom opens to the vernal gale:

8375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her face, in beauty's sweet attraction dress'd,"
8376,THE ARGUMENT.,The smile of maiden innocence express'd;
8377,THE ARGUMENT.,"While health, that rises with the new-born day,"
8378,THE ARGUMENT.,Breathed o'er her cheek the softest blush of May:
8379,THE ARGUMENT.,Still in her look complacence smiled serene;
8380,THE ARGUMENT.,She moved the charmer of the rural scene!
8381,THE ARGUMENT.,"""'Twas at that season when the fields resume           410"
8382,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their loveliest hues, array'd in vernal bloom:"
8383,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yon ship, rich freighted from the Italian shore,"
8384,THE ARGUMENT.,To Thames' fair banks her costly tribute bore:
8385,THE ARGUMENT.,"While thus my father saw his ample hoard,"
8386,THE ARGUMENT.,"From this return, with recent treasures stored,"
8387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Me, with affairs of commerce charged, he sent"
8388,THE ARGUMENT.,To Albert's humble mansion--soon I went!
8389,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too soon, alas! unconscious of the event."
8390,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, struck with sweet surprise and silent awe,"
8391,THE ARGUMENT.,The gentle mistress of my hopes I saw;                   420
8392,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, wounded first by love's resistless arms,"
8393,THE ARGUMENT.,My glowing bosom throbb'd with strange alarms:
8394,THE ARGUMENT.,My ever charming Anna! who alone
8395,THE ARGUMENT.,Can all the frowns of cruel fate atone;
8396,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh! while all-conscious memory holds her power,"
8397,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can I forget that sweetly-painful hour,"
8398,THE ARGUMENT.,"When from those eyes, with lovely lightning fraught,"
8399,THE ARGUMENT.,My fluttering spirits first the infection caught?
8400,THE ARGUMENT.,"When as I gazed, my faltering tongue betray'd"
8401,THE ARGUMENT.,"The heart's quick tumults, or refused its aid;           430"
8402,THE ARGUMENT.,"While the dim light my ravish'd eyes forsook,"
8403,THE ARGUMENT.,"And every limb, unstrung with terror, shook;"
8404,THE ARGUMENT.,With all her powers dissenting reason strove
8405,THE ARGUMENT.,To tame at first the kindling flame of love:
8406,THE ARGUMENT.,"She strove in vain; subdued by charms divine,"
8407,THE ARGUMENT.,My soul a victim fell at beauty's shrine.
8408,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft from the din of bustling life I stray'd,"
8409,THE ARGUMENT.,In happier scenes to see my lovely maid;
8410,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full oft, where Thames his wandering current leads,"
8411,THE ARGUMENT.,We roved at evening hour through flowery meads;          440
8412,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, while my heart's soft anguish I reveal'd,"
8413,THE ARGUMENT.,To her with tender sighs my hope appeal'd.
8414,THE ARGUMENT.,"While the sweet nymph my faithful tale believed,"
8415,THE ARGUMENT.,Her snowy breast with secret tumult heaved;
8416,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, train'd in rural scenes from earliest youth,"
8417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nature was hers, and innocence and truth:"
8418,THE ARGUMENT.,"She never knew the city damsel's art,"
8419,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose frothy pertness charms the vacant heart.
8420,THE ARGUMENT.,"My suit prevail'd! for love inform'd my tongue,"
8421,THE ARGUMENT.,And on his votary's lips persuasion hung.                450
8422,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her eyes with conscious sympathy withdrew,"
8423,THE ARGUMENT.,And o'er her cheek the rosy current flew.
8424,THE ARGUMENT.,Thrice happy hours! where with no dark allay
8425,THE ARGUMENT.,Life's fairest sunshine gilds the vernal day;
8426,THE ARGUMENT.,"For here the sigh that soft affection heaves,"
8427,THE ARGUMENT.,From stings of sharper woe the soul relieves:
8428,THE ARGUMENT.,"Elysian scenes! too happy long to last,"
8429,THE ARGUMENT.,Too soon a storm the smiling dawn o'ercast;
8430,THE ARGUMENT.,Too soon some demon to my father bore
8431,THE ARGUMENT.,The tidings that his heart with anguish tore.            460
8432,THE ARGUMENT.,"My pride to kindle, with dissuasive voice"
8433,THE ARGUMENT.,Awhile he labour'd to degrade my choice:
8434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, in the whirling wave of pleasure, sought"
8435,THE ARGUMENT.,From its loved object to divert my thought.
8436,THE ARGUMENT.,With equal hope he might attempt to bind
8437,THE ARGUMENT.,In chains of adamant the lawless wind;
8438,THE ARGUMENT.,"For love had aim'd the fatal shaft too sure,"
8439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hope fed the wound, and absence knew no cure."
8440,THE ARGUMENT.,"With alienated look, each art he saw"
8441,THE ARGUMENT.,Still baffled by superior nature's law.                  470
8442,THE ARGUMENT.,"His anxious mind on various schemes revolved,"
8443,THE ARGUMENT.,At last on cruel exile he resolved;
8444,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rigorous doom was fix'd; alas, how vain"
8445,THE ARGUMENT.,To him of tender anguish to complain!
8446,THE ARGUMENT.,"His soul, that never love's sweet influence felt,"
8447,THE ARGUMENT.,By social sympathy could never melt:
8448,THE ARGUMENT.,With stern command to Albert's charge he gave
8449,THE ARGUMENT.,To waft Palemon o'er the distant wave.
8450,THE ARGUMENT.,"""The ship was laden and prepared to sail,"
8451,THE ARGUMENT.,And only waited now the leading gale:                    480
8452,THE ARGUMENT.,"'Twas ours, in that sad period, first to prove"
8453,THE ARGUMENT.,"The poignant torments of despairing love,"
8454,THE ARGUMENT.,"The impatient wish that never feels repose,"
8455,THE ARGUMENT.,"Desire that with perpetual current flows,"
8456,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fluctuating pangs of hope and fear,"
8457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Joy distant still, and sorrow ever near."
8458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, while the pangs of thought severer grew,"
8459,THE ARGUMENT.,"The western breezes inauspicious blew,"
8460,THE ARGUMENT.,Hastening the moment of our last adieu.
8461,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vessel parted on the falling tide,                   490"
8462,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet time one sacred hour to love supplied:
8463,THE ARGUMENT.,"The night was silent, and advancing fast,"
8464,THE ARGUMENT.,The moon o'er Thames her silver mantle cast;
8465,THE ARGUMENT.,"Impatient hope the midnight path explored,"
8466,THE ARGUMENT.,And led me to the nymph my soul adored.
8467,THE ARGUMENT.,Soon her quick footsteps struck my listening ear;
8468,THE ARGUMENT.,She came confest! the lovely maid drew near!
8469,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, ah! what force of language can impart"
8470,THE ARGUMENT.,The impetuous joy that glow'd in either heart?
8471,THE ARGUMENT.,O ye! whose melting hearts are form'd to prove           500
8472,THE ARGUMENT.,The trembling ecstasies of genuine love;
8473,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, with delicious agony, the thought"
8474,THE ARGUMENT.,Is to the verge of high delirium wrought:
8475,THE ARGUMENT.,Your secret sympathy alone can tell
8476,THE ARGUMENT.,What raptures then the throbbing bosom swell:
8477,THE ARGUMENT.,"O'er all the nerves what tender tumults roll,"
8478,THE ARGUMENT.,While love with sweet enchantment melts the soul.
8479,THE ARGUMENT.,"""In transport lost, by trembling hope imprest,"
8480,THE ARGUMENT.,"The blushing virgin sunk upon my breast,"
8481,THE ARGUMENT.,While hers congenial beat with fond alarms;              510
8482,THE ARGUMENT.,Dissolving softness! Paradise of charms!
8483,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flash'd from our eyes, in warm transfusion flew"
8484,THE ARGUMENT.,Our blending spirits that each other drew!
8485,THE ARGUMENT.,O bliss supreme! where virtue's self can melt
8486,THE ARGUMENT.,With joys that guilty pleasure never felt;
8487,THE ARGUMENT.,"Form'd to refine the thought with chaste desire,"
8488,THE ARGUMENT.,And kindle sweet affection's purest fire.
8489,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ah! wherefore should my hopeless love, she cries,--"
8490,THE ARGUMENT.,"While sorrow bursts with interrupting sighs,--"
8491,THE ARGUMENT.,"For ever destined to lament in vain,                     520"
8492,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such nattering, fond ideas entertain?"
8493,THE ARGUMENT.,"My heart through scenes of fair illusion stray'd,"
8494,THE ARGUMENT.,To joys decreed for some superior maid.
8495,THE ARGUMENT.,"'Tis mine, abandon'd to severe distress,"
8496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still to complain, and never hope redress--"
8497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go then, dear youth! thy father's rage atone,"
8498,THE ARGUMENT.,And let this tortured bosom beat alone.
8499,THE ARGUMENT.,The hovering anger yet thou mayst appease:
8500,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go then, dear youth! nor tempt the faithless seas."
8501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Find out some happier maid, whose equal charms           530"
8502,THE ARGUMENT.,With fortune's fairer joys may bless thy arms:
8503,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, smiling o'er thee with indulgent ray,"
8504,THE ARGUMENT.,Prosperity shall hail each new-born day:
8505,THE ARGUMENT.,Too well thou know'st good Albert's niggard fate
8506,THE ARGUMENT.,Ill fitted to sustain thy father's hate.
8507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go then, I charge thee by thy generous love,"
8508,THE ARGUMENT.,That fatal to my father thus may prove;
8509,THE ARGUMENT.,"On me alone let dark affliction fall,"
8510,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose heart for thee will gladly suffer all.
8511,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then haste thee hence, Palemon, ere too late,            540"
8512,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor rashly hope to brave opposing fate.
8513,THE ARGUMENT.,"""She ceased: while anguish in her angel-face"
8514,THE ARGUMENT.,O'er all her beauties shower'd celestial grace:
8515,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not Helen, in her bridal charms array'd,"
8516,THE ARGUMENT.,Was half so lovely as this gentle maid.--
8517,THE ARGUMENT.,"O soul of all my wishes! I replied,"
8518,THE ARGUMENT.,Can that soft fabric stem affliction's tide?
8519,THE ARGUMENT.,"Canst thou, bright pattern of exalted truth,"
8520,THE ARGUMENT.,"To sorrow doom the summer of thy youth,"
8521,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I, ingrateful! all that sweetness see                550"
8522,THE ARGUMENT.,Consign'd to lasting misery for me?
8523,THE ARGUMENT.,Sooner this moment may the eternal doom
8524,THE ARGUMENT.,Palemon in the silent earth entomb:
8525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attest, thou moon, fair regent of the night!"
8526,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose lustre sickens at this mournful sight:
8527,THE ARGUMENT.,"By all the pangs divided lovers feel,"
8528,THE ARGUMENT.,Which sweet possession only knows to heal;
8529,THE ARGUMENT.,"By all the horrors brooding o'er the deep,"
8530,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where fate, and ruin, sad dominion keep;"
8531,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though tyrant duty o'er me threatening stands,           560"
8532,THE ARGUMENT.,"And claims obedience to her stern commands,"
8533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Should fortune cruel or auspicious prove,"
8534,THE ARGUMENT.,Her smile or frown shall never change my love:
8535,THE ARGUMENT.,"My heart, that now must every joy resign,"
8536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Incapable of change, is only thine."
8537,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Oh, cease to weep, this storm will yet decay,"
8538,THE ARGUMENT.,And the sad clouds of sorrow melt away:
8539,THE ARGUMENT.,"While through the rugged path of life we go,"
8540,THE ARGUMENT.,All mortals taste the bitter draught of woe:
8541,THE ARGUMENT.,"The famed and great, decreed to equal pain,              570"
8542,THE ARGUMENT.,Full oft in splendid wretchedness complain:
8543,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this, prosperity, with brighter ray,"
8544,THE ARGUMENT.,"In smiling contrast gilds our vital day,"
8545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, too, sweet maid! ere twice ten months are o'er,"
8546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shalt hail Palemon to his native shore,"
8547,THE ARGUMENT.,Where never interest shall divide us more.--
8548,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Her struggling soul, o'erwhelm'd with tender grief,"
8549,THE ARGUMENT.,Now found an interval of short relief:
8550,THE ARGUMENT.,So melts the surface of the frozen stream
8551,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath the wintry sun's departing beam.                 580
8552,THE ARGUMENT.,"With cruel haste the shades of night withdrew,"
8553,THE ARGUMENT.,And gave the signal of a sad adieu.
8554,THE ARGUMENT.,"As on my neck the afflicted maiden hung,"
8555,THE ARGUMENT.,A thousand racking doubts her spirit wrung:
8556,THE ARGUMENT.,"She wept the terrors of the fearful wave,"
8557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too oft, alas! the wandering lover's grave:"
8558,THE ARGUMENT.,"With soft persuasion I dispell'd her fear,"
8559,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from her cheek beguiled the falling tear,"
8560,THE ARGUMENT.,"While dying fondness languished in her eyes,"
8561,THE ARGUMENT.,She pour'd her soul to heaven in suppliant sighs!        590
8562,THE ARGUMENT.,"'Look down with pity, O ye powers above!"
8563,THE ARGUMENT.,Who hear the sad complaint of bleeding love;
8564,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye, who the secret laws of fate explore,"
8565,THE ARGUMENT.,Alone can tell if he returns no more;
8566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or if the hour of future joy remain,"
8567,THE ARGUMENT.,Long-wish'd atonement of long-suffer'd pain;
8568,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bid every guardian minister attend,"
8569,THE ARGUMENT.,And from all ill the much-loved youth defend!'
8570,THE ARGUMENT.,"With grief o'erwhelm'd we parted twice in vain,"
8571,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, urged by strong attraction, met again.              600"
8572,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last, by cruel fortune torn apart,"
8573,THE ARGUMENT.,"While tender passion beat in either heart,"
8574,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our eyes transfix'd with agonizing look,"
8575,THE ARGUMENT.,"One sad farewell, one last embrace, we took."
8576,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forlorn of hope the lovely maid I left,"
8577,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pensive and pale, of every joy bereft:"
8578,THE ARGUMENT.,"She to her silent couch retired to weep,"
8579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whilst I embark'd, in sadness, on the deep."""
8580,THE ARGUMENT.,"His tale thus closed, from sympathy of grief"
8581,THE ARGUMENT.,Palemon's bosom felt a sweet relief:                     610
8582,THE ARGUMENT.,"To mutual friendship thus sincerely true,"
8583,THE ARGUMENT.,"No secret wish, or fear their bosoms knew;"
8584,THE ARGUMENT.,"In mutual hazards oft severely tried,"
8585,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor hope, nor danger, could their love divide."
8586,THE ARGUMENT.,Ye tender maids! in whose pathetic souls
8587,THE ARGUMENT.,"Compassion's sacred stream impetuous rolls,"
8588,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose warm affections exquisitely feel
8589,THE ARGUMENT.,The secret wound you tremble to reveal;
8590,THE ARGUMENT.,Ah! may no wanderer of the stormy main
8591,THE ARGUMENT.,Pour through your breasts the soft delicious bane;       620
8592,THE ARGUMENT.,May never fatal tenderness approve
8593,THE ARGUMENT.,The fond effusions of their ardent love:
8594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh! warn'd, avoid the path that leads to woe,"
8595,THE ARGUMENT.,Where thorns and baneful weeds alternate grow:
8596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let them severer stoic nymphs possess,"
8597,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose stubborn passions feel no soft distress.
8598,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, as the youths returning o'er the plain"
8599,THE ARGUMENT.,"Approach'd the lonely margin of the main,"
8600,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, with attention roused, Arion eyed"
8601,THE ARGUMENT.,"The graceful lover, form'd in nature's pride.            630"
8602,THE ARGUMENT.,"His frame the happiest symmetry display'd,"
8603,THE ARGUMENT.,And locks of waving gold his neck array'd;
8604,THE ARGUMENT.,"In every look the Paphian graces shine,"
8605,THE ARGUMENT.,Soft breathing o'er his cheek their bloom divine;
8606,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lighten'd heart he smiled serenely gay,"
8607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like young Adonis, or the Son of May."
8608,THE ARGUMENT.,Not Cytherea from a fairer swain
8609,THE ARGUMENT.,Received her apple on the Trojan plain.
8610,THE ARGUMENT.,"IV.   The sun's bright orb, declining all serene,"
8611,THE ARGUMENT.,Now glanced obliquely o'er the woodland scene;           640
8612,THE ARGUMENT.,Creation smiles around; on every spray
8613,THE ARGUMENT.,The warbling birds exalt their evening lay;
8614,THE ARGUMENT.,"Blithe skipping o'er yon hill, the fleecy train"
8615,THE ARGUMENT.,Join the deep chorus of the lowing plain;
8616,THE ARGUMENT.,The golden lime and orange there were seen
8617,THE ARGUMENT.,On fragrant branches of perpetual green;
8618,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crystal streams that velvet meadows lave,"
8619,THE ARGUMENT.,To the green ocean roll with chiding wave.
8620,THE ARGUMENT.,"The glassy ocean, hush'd, forgets to roar,"
8621,THE ARGUMENT.,But trembling murmurs on the sandy shore;                650
8622,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lo! his surface lovely to behold,"
8623,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glows in the west, a sea of living gold!"
8624,THE ARGUMENT.,While all above a thousand liveries gay
8625,THE ARGUMENT.,The skies with pomp ineffable array.
8626,THE ARGUMENT.,Arabian sweets perfume the happy plains;
8627,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above, beneath, around, enchantment reigns!"
8628,THE ARGUMENT.,"While glowing Vesper leads the starry train,"
8629,THE ARGUMENT.,"And night slow draws her veil o'er land and main,"
8630,THE ARGUMENT.,"Emerging clouds the azure east invade,"
8631,THE ARGUMENT.,And wrap the lucid spheres in gradual shade;             660
8632,THE ARGUMENT.,"While yet the songsters of the vocal grove,"
8633,THE ARGUMENT.,With dying numbers tune the soul to love:
8634,THE ARGUMENT.,With joyful eyes the attentive master sees
8635,THE ARGUMENT.,The auspicious omens of an eastern breeze.
8636,THE ARGUMENT.,Round the charged bowl the sailors form a ring;
8637,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns recount the wondrous tale, or sing,"
8638,THE ARGUMENT.,"As love, or battle, hardships of the main,"
8639,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or genial wine, awake the homely strain."
8640,THE ARGUMENT.,Then some the watch of night alternate keep:
8641,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest lie buried in oblivious sleep.                  670
8642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep midnight now involves the livid skies,"
8643,THE ARGUMENT.,"When eastern breezes, yet enervate, rise:"
8644,THE ARGUMENT.,The waning moon behind a watery shroud
8645,THE ARGUMENT.,Pale glimmer'd o'er the long protracted cloud;
8646,THE ARGUMENT.,"A mighty halo round her silver throne,"
8647,THE ARGUMENT.,"With parting meteors cross'd, portentous shone:"
8648,THE ARGUMENT.,"This in the troubled sky full oft prevails,"
8649,THE ARGUMENT.,Oft deem'd a signal of tempestuous gales.
8650,THE ARGUMENT.,"While young Arion sleeps, before his sight"
8651,THE ARGUMENT.,Tumultuous swim the visions of the night:                680
8652,THE ARGUMENT.,Now blooming Anna with her happy swain
8653,THE ARGUMENT.,Approach'd the sacred hymeneal fane;
8654,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anon tremendous lightnings flash between,"
8655,THE ARGUMENT.,"And funeral pomp, and weeping loves are seen:"
8656,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now with Palemon, up a rocky steep,"
8657,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose summit trembles o'er the roaring deep,"
8658,THE ARGUMENT.,With painful step he climb'd; while far above
8659,THE ARGUMENT.,Sweet Anna charm'd them with the voice of love:
8660,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then sudden from the slippery height they fell,"
8661,THE ARGUMENT.,While dreadful yawn'd beneath the jaws of hell.          690
8662,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid this fearful trance, a thundering sound"
8663,THE ARGUMENT.,"He hears, and thrice the hollow decks rebound:"
8664,THE ARGUMENT.,"Upstarting from his couch, on deck he sprung,"
8665,THE ARGUMENT.,Thrice with shrill note the boatswain's whistle rung:
8666,THE ARGUMENT.,All hands unmoor! proclaims a boisterous cry;
8667,THE ARGUMENT.,All hands unmoor! the cavern'd rocks reply.
8668,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roused from repose, aloft the sailors swarm,"
8669,THE ARGUMENT.,And with their levers soon the windlass arm:
8670,THE ARGUMENT.,"The order given, up springing with a bound,"
8671,THE ARGUMENT.,"They fix the bars, and heave the windlass [3] round;     700"
8672,THE ARGUMENT.,At every turn the clanging pauls resound:
8673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Up-torn reluctant from its oozy cave,"
8674,THE ARGUMENT.,The ponderous anchor rises o'er the wave.
8675,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on the slippery masts the yards ascend,"
8676,THE ARGUMENT.,And far abroad the canvas wings extend.
8677,THE ARGUMENT.,"Along the glassy plain the vessel glides,"
8678,THE ARGUMENT.,While azure radiance trembles on her sides;
8679,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lunar rays in long reflection gleam,"
8680,THE ARGUMENT.,With silver deluging the fluid stream.
8681,THE ARGUMENT.,"Levant and Thracian gales alternate play,                710"
8682,THE ARGUMENT.,Then in the Egyptian quarter die away.
8683,THE ARGUMENT.,A calm ensues; adjacent shores they dread;
8684,THE ARGUMENT.,"The boats, with rowers mann'd, are sent ahead;"
8685,THE ARGUMENT.,"With cordage fasten'd to the lofty prow,"
8686,THE ARGUMENT.,Aloof to sea the stately ship they tow; [4]
8687,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nervous crew their sweeping oars extend,"
8688,THE ARGUMENT.,And pealing shouts the shore of Candia rend:
8689,THE ARGUMENT.,Success attends their skill! the danger's o'er!
8690,THE ARGUMENT.,"The port is doubled, and beheld no more."
8691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now morn with gradual pace advanced on high,           720"
8692,THE ARGUMENT.,Whitening with orient beam the twilight sky:
8693,THE ARGUMENT.,"She comes not in refulgent pomp array'd,"
8694,THE ARGUMENT.,"But frowning stern, and wrapt in sullen shade."
8695,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above incumbent mists, tall Ida's height,"
8696,THE ARGUMENT.,Tremendous rock! emerges on the sight;
8697,THE ARGUMENT.,"North-east a league, the Isle of Standia bears,"
8698,THE ARGUMENT.,"And westward, Freschin's woody Cape appears."
8699,THE ARGUMENT.,In distant angles while the transient gales
8700,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alternate blow, they trim the flagging sails;"
8701,THE ARGUMENT.,"The drowsy air attentive to retain,                      730"
8702,THE ARGUMENT.,As from unnumber'd points it sweeps the main.
8703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now swelling stud-sails [5] on each side extend,"
8704,THE ARGUMENT.,Then stay-sails [6] sidelong to the breeze ascend;
8705,THE ARGUMENT.,While all to court the veering winds are placed
8706,THE ARGUMENT.,"With yards alternate square, and sharply braced."
8707,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dim horizon lowering vapours shroud,"
8708,THE ARGUMENT.,And blot the sun yet struggling in the cloud;
8709,THE ARGUMENT.,"Through the wide atmosphere, condensed with haze,"
8710,THE ARGUMENT.,His glaring orb emits a sanguine blaze.
8711,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pilots now their azimuth attend,                     740"
8712,THE ARGUMENT.,On which all courses duly form'd depend:
8713,THE ARGUMENT.,"The compass placed to catch the rising ray, [7]"
8714,THE ARGUMENT.,The quadrant's shadows studious they survey;
8715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Along the arch the gradual index slides,"
8716,THE ARGUMENT.,While Phoebus down the vertic-circle glides;
8717,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now seen on ocean's utmost verge to swim,"
8718,THE ARGUMENT.,He sweeps it vibrant with his nether limb.
8719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus height and polar distance are obtain'd,"
8720,THE ARGUMENT.,Then latitude and declination gain'd;
8721,THE ARGUMENT.,"In chiliads next the analogy is sought,                  750"
8722,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the sinical triangle wrought:
8723,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this magnetic variance is explored,"
8724,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just angles known, and polar truth restored."
8725,THE ARGUMENT.,"The natives, while the ship departs their land,"
8726,THE ARGUMENT.,Ashore with admiration gazing stand.
8727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Majestically slow, before the breeze"
8728,THE ARGUMENT.,She moved triumphant o'er the yielding seas;
8729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her bottom through translucent waters shone,"
8730,THE ARGUMENT.,White as the clouds beneath the blaze of noon;
8731,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bending wales [8] their contrast next display'd,     760"
8732,THE ARGUMENT.,All fore and aft in polish'd jet array'd.
8733,THE ARGUMENT.,"Britannia, riding awful on the prow,"
8734,THE ARGUMENT.,Gazed o'er the vassal waves that roll'd below:
8735,THE ARGUMENT.,Where'er she moved the vassal waves were seen

9102,THE ARGUMENT.,"So, govern'd by the steersman's glowing hands,"
9103,THE ARGUMENT.,The regent helm her motion still commands.
9104,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the transient squall to leeward past,"
9105,THE ARGUMENT.,Again she rallies to the sullen blast:
9106,THE ARGUMENT.,The helm to starboard [13] moves; each shivering sail
9107,THE ARGUMENT.,Is sharply trimm'd to clasp the augmenting gale.
9108,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mizen draws; she springs aloof once more,"
9109,THE ARGUMENT.,While the fore stay-sail [14] balances before.              190
9110,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fore-sail braced obliquely to the wind,"
9111,THE ARGUMENT.,They near the prow the extended tack confined;
9112,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then on the leeward sheet the seamen bend,"
9113,THE ARGUMENT.,And haul the bow-line to the bowsprit-end.
9114,THE ARGUMENT.,To top-sails next they haste; the bunt-lines gone!
9115,THE ARGUMENT.,Through rattling blocks the clue-lines swiftly run;
9116,THE ARGUMENT.,"The extending sheets on either side are mann'd,"
9117,THE ARGUMENT.,Abroad they come! the fluttering sails expand;
9118,THE ARGUMENT.,The yards again ascend each comrade mast.
9119,THE ARGUMENT.,"The leeches taught, the halyards are made fast,             200"
9120,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bow-lines haul'd, and yards to starboard braced, [15]"
9121,THE ARGUMENT.,And straggling ropes in pendent order placed.
9122,THE ARGUMENT.,"The main-sail, by the squall so lately rent,"
9123,THE ARGUMENT.,"In streaming pendants flying, is unbent:"
9124,THE ARGUMENT.,"With brails [16] refix'd, another soon prepared,"
9125,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascending, spreads along beneath the yard."
9126,THE ARGUMENT.,"To each yard-arm the head-rope [17] they extend,"
9127,THE ARGUMENT.,And soon their earings and their robans [18] bend.
9128,THE ARGUMENT.,"That task perform'd, they first the braces slack, [19]"
9129,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to the chesstree drag the unwilling tack.              210
9130,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, while the lee clue-garnet's lower'd away,"
9131,THE ARGUMENT.,"Taught aft the sheet they tally, and belay. [20]"
9132,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now to the north from Afric's burning shore,"
9133,THE ARGUMENT.,A troop of porpoises their course explore:
9134,THE ARGUMENT.,"In curling wreaths they gambol on the tide,"
9135,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now bound aloft, now down the billow glide:"
9136,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their tracks awhile the hoary waves retain,"
9137,THE ARGUMENT.,That burn in sparkling trails along the main--
9138,THE ARGUMENT.,"These fleetest coursers of the finny race,"
9139,THE ARGUMENT.,"When threatening clouds the ethereal vault deface,          220"
9140,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their route to leeward still sagacious form,"
9141,THE ARGUMENT.,To shun the fury of the approaching storm.
9142,THE ARGUMENT.,"III.  Fair Candia now no more, beneath her lee,"
9143,THE ARGUMENT.,Protects the vessel from the insulting sea;
9144,THE ARGUMENT.,"Round her broad arms, impatient of control,"
9145,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roused from the secret deep, the billows roll:"
9146,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sunk were the bulwarks of the friendly shore,"
9147,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the scene an hostile aspect wore.
9148,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flattering wind, that late with promised aid"
9149,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Candia's bay the unwilling ship betray'd,              230"
9150,THE ARGUMENT.,"No longer fawns beneath the fair disguise,"
9151,THE ARGUMENT.,But like a ruffian on his quarry flies.
9152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tost on the tide she feels the tempest blow,"
9153,THE ARGUMENT.,And dreads the vengeance of so fell a foe--
9154,THE ARGUMENT.,"As the proud horse, with costly trappings gay,"
9155,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exulting, prances to the bloody fray;"
9156,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spurning the ground he glories in his might,"
9157,THE ARGUMENT.,But reels tumultuous in the shock of fight:
9158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even so, caparison'd in gaudy pride,"
9159,THE ARGUMENT.,The bounding vessel dances on the tide.                     240
9160,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce and more fierce the gathering tempest grew,"
9161,THE ARGUMENT.,South and by west the threatening demon blew;
9162,THE ARGUMENT.,"Auster's resistless force all air invades,"
9163,THE ARGUMENT.,And every rolling wave more ample spreads:
9164,THE ARGUMENT.,The ship no longer can her top-sails bear;
9165,THE ARGUMENT.,No hopes of milder weather now appear.
9166,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bow-lines and halyards are cast off again,"
9167,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clue-lines haul'd down, and sheets let fly amain:"
9168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Embrail'd each top-sail, and by braces squared,"
9169,THE ARGUMENT.,"The seamen climb aloft, and man each yard:                  250"
9170,THE ARGUMENT.,"They furl'd the sails, and pointed to the wind"
9171,THE ARGUMENT.,"The yards, by rolling tackles [21] then confined,"
9172,THE ARGUMENT.,While o'er the ship the gallant boatswain flies;
9173,THE ARGUMENT.,Like a hoarse mastiff through the storm he cries--
9174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prompt to direct the unskilful still appears,"
9175,THE ARGUMENT.,"The expert he praises, and the timid cheers."
9176,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now some, to strike top-gallant-yards [22] attend,"
9177,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some, travellers up the weather-back-stays [23] send,"
9178,THE ARGUMENT.,At each mast-head the top-ropes [24] others bend:
9179,THE ARGUMENT.,"The parrels, lifts, [25] and clue-lines soon are gone,      260"
9180,THE ARGUMENT.,"Topp'd and unrigg'd, they down the backstays run;"
9181,THE ARGUMENT.,"The yards secure along the booms [26] were laid,"
9182,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the flying ropes aloft belay'd:
9183,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their sails reduced, and all the rigging clear,"
9184,THE ARGUMENT.,Awhile the crew relax from toils severe;
9185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Awhile their spirits with fatigue opprest,"
9186,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain expect the alternate hour of rest--
9187,THE ARGUMENT.,"But with redoubling force the tempests blow,"
9188,THE ARGUMENT.,And watery hills in dread succession flow:
9189,THE ARGUMENT.,A dismal shade o'ercasts the frowning skies;                270
9190,THE ARGUMENT.,New troubles grow; fresh difficulties rise;
9191,THE ARGUMENT.,"No season this from duty to descend,"
9192,THE ARGUMENT.,All hands on deck must now the storm attend.
9193,THE ARGUMENT.,"His race perform'd, the sacred lamp of day"
9194,THE ARGUMENT.,Now dipt in western clouds his parting ray!
9195,THE ARGUMENT.,"His languid fires, half lost in ambient haze,"
9196,THE ARGUMENT.,Refract along the dusk a crimson blaze;
9197,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till deep immerged the sickening orb descends,"
9198,THE ARGUMENT.,And cheerless night o'er heaven her reign extends.
9199,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sad evening's hour, how different from the past!            280"
9200,THE ARGUMENT.,"No flaming pomp, no blushing glories cast,"
9201,THE ARGUMENT.,No ray of friendly light is seen around;
9202,THE ARGUMENT.,The moon and stars in hopeless shade are drown'd.
9203,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship no longer can whole courses [27] bear,"
9204,THE ARGUMENT.,To reef them now becomes the master's care;
9205,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sailors summon'd aft all ready stand,"
9206,THE ARGUMENT.,And man the enfolding brails at his command:
9207,THE ARGUMENT.,"But here the doubtful officers dispute,"
9208,THE ARGUMENT.,Till skill and judgment prejudice confute:
9209,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Rodmond, to new methods still a foe,                    290"
9210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Would first, at all events, the sheet let go;"
9211,THE ARGUMENT.,"To long-tried practice obstinately warm,"
9212,THE ARGUMENT.,"He doubts conviction, and relies on form."
9213,THE ARGUMENT.,"This Albert and Arion disapprove,"
9214,THE ARGUMENT.,And first to brail the tack up firmly move:
9215,THE ARGUMENT.,"""The watchful seaman, whose sagacious eye"
9216,THE ARGUMENT.,"On sure experience may with truth rely,"
9217,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who from the reigning cause foretells the effect,"
9218,THE ARGUMENT.,This barbarous practice ever will reject;
9219,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, fluttering loose in air, the rigid sail                300"
9220,THE ARGUMENT.,Soon flits to ruins in the furious gale;
9221,THE ARGUMENT.,"And he, who strives the tempest to disarm,"
9222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will never first embrail the lee yard-arm."""
9223,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Albert spoke; to windward, at his call,"
9224,THE ARGUMENT.,Some seamen the clue-garnet stand to haul--
9225,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tack's eased off, [28] while the involving clue"
9226,THE ARGUMENT.,Between the pendent blocks ascending flew;
9227,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sheet and weather-brace they now stand by, [29]"
9228,THE ARGUMENT.,The lee clue-garnet and the bunt-lines ply:
9229,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, all prepared, Let go the sheet! he cries--           310"
9230,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loud rattling, jarring, through the blocks it flies!"
9231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shivering at first, till by the blast impell'd,"
9232,THE ARGUMENT.,High o'er the lee yard-arm the canvas swell'd;
9233,THE ARGUMENT.,"By spilling lines [30] embraced, with brails confined,"
9234,THE ARGUMENT.,It lies at length unshaken by the wind.
9235,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fore-sail then secured with equal care,"
9236,THE ARGUMENT.,Again to reef the mainsail they repair;
9237,THE ARGUMENT.,"While some above the yard o'erhaul the tye,"
9238,THE ARGUMENT.,Below the down-haul tackle [31] others ply;
9239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Jears, [32] lifts, and brails, a seaman each attends,       320"
9240,THE ARGUMENT.,And down the mast its mighty yard descends:
9241,THE ARGUMENT.,"When lower'd sufficient they securely brace,"
9242,THE ARGUMENT.,And fix the rolling tackle in its place;
9243,THE ARGUMENT.,"The reef-lines [33] and their earings now prepared,"
9244,THE ARGUMENT.,Mounting on pliant shrouds [34] they man the yard:
9245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far on the extremes appear two able hands,"
9246,THE ARGUMENT.,For no inferior skill this task demands--
9247,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wind, foremost, young Arion strides;"
9248,THE ARGUMENT.,The lee yard-arm the gallant boatswain rides:
9249,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each earing to its cringle first they bend,                 330"
9250,THE ARGUMENT.,The reef-band [35] then along the yard extend;
9251,THE ARGUMENT.,"The circling earings [36] round the extremes entwined,"
9252,THE ARGUMENT.,By outer and by inner turns they bind;
9253,THE ARGUMENT.,"The reef-lines next from hand to hand received,"
9254,THE ARGUMENT.,Through eyelet-holes and roban-legs were reeved;
9255,THE ARGUMENT.,"The folding reefs in plaits inroll'd they lay,"
9256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Extend the worming lines, and ends belay."
9257,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hadst thou, Arion! held the leeward post"
9258,THE ARGUMENT.,"While on the yard by mountain billows tost,"
9259,THE ARGUMENT.,Perhaps oblivion o'er our tragic tale                       340
9260,THE ARGUMENT.,Had then for ever drawn her dusky veil;
9261,THE ARGUMENT.,"But ruling Heaven prolong'd thy vital date,"
9262,THE ARGUMENT.,Severer ills to suffer and relate.
9263,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while aloft the order those attend"
9264,THE ARGUMENT.,"To furl the main-sail, or on deck descend;"
9265,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sea, [37] up-surging with stupendous roll,"
9266,THE ARGUMENT.,To instant ruin seems to doom the whole:
9267,THE ARGUMENT.,"O friends, secure your hold! Arion cries--"
9268,THE ARGUMENT.,It comes all dreadful! down the vessel lies
9269,THE ARGUMENT.,"Half buried sideways; while, beneath it tost,               350"
9270,THE ARGUMENT.,Four seamen off the lee yard-arm are lost:
9271,THE ARGUMENT.,"Torn with resistless fury from their hold,"
9272,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain their struggling arms the yard enfold;
9273,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain to grapple flying ropes they try,"
9274,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ropes, alas! a solid gripe deny:"
9275,THE ARGUMENT.,Prone on the midnight surge with panting breath
9276,THE ARGUMENT.,"They cry for aid, and long contend with death;"
9277,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o'er their heads the rolling billows sweep,"
9278,THE ARGUMENT.,And down they sink in everlasting sleep.
9279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bereft of power to help, their comrades see                 360"
9280,THE ARGUMENT.,The wretched victims die beneath the lee;
9281,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fruitless sorrow their lost state bemoan,"
9282,THE ARGUMENT.,Perhaps a fatal prelude to their own!
9283,THE ARGUMENT.,"In dark suspense on deck the pilots stand,"
9284,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor can determine on the next command:
9285,THE ARGUMENT.,Though still they knew the vessel's armed side
9286,THE ARGUMENT.,Impenetrable to the clasping tide;
9287,THE ARGUMENT.,Though still the waters by no secret wound
9288,THE ARGUMENT.,A passage to her deep recesses found;
9289,THE ARGUMENT.,"Surrounding evils yet they ponder o'er,                     370"
9290,THE ARGUMENT.,"A storm, a dangerous sea, and leeward shore!"
9291,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Should they, though reef'd, again their sails extend,"
9292,THE ARGUMENT.,Again in shivering streamers they may rend;
9293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, should they stand, beneath the oppressive strain,"
9294,THE ARGUMENT.,The down-press'd ship may never rise again;
9295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too late to weather now Morea's land, [38]"
9296,THE ARGUMENT.,"And drifting fast on Athens' rocky strand.""--"
9297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus they lament the consequence severe,"
9298,THE ARGUMENT.,Where perils unallay'd by hope appear:
9299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long pondering in their minds each fear'd event,            380"
9300,THE ARGUMENT.,At last to furl the courses they consent;
9301,THE ARGUMENT.,"That done, to reef the mizen next agree,"
9302,THE ARGUMENT.,And try [39] beneath it sidelong in the sea.
9303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now down the mast the yard they lower away,"
9304,THE ARGUMENT.,Then jears and topping-lift [40] secure belay;
9305,THE ARGUMENT.,"The head, with doubling canvas fenced around,"
9306,THE ARGUMENT.,In balance near the lofty peak they bound;
9307,THE ARGUMENT.,"The reef enwrapp'd, the inserting knittles tied,"
9308,THE ARGUMENT.,The halyards throat and peak are next applied--
9309,THE ARGUMENT.,"The order given, the yard aloft they sway'd,                390"
9310,THE ARGUMENT.,"The brails relax'd, the extended sheet belay'd;"
9311,THE ARGUMENT.,"The helm its post forsook, and, lash'd a-lee, [41]"
9312,THE ARGUMENT.,Inclined the wayward prow to front the sea.
9313,THE ARGUMENT.,"IV.   When sacred Orpheus on the Stygian coast,"
9314,THE ARGUMENT.,With notes divine deplored his consort lost;
9315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though round him perils grew in fell array,"
9316,THE ARGUMENT.,And Fates and Furies stood to bar his way;
9317,THE ARGUMENT.,Not more adventurous was the attempt to move
9318,THE ARGUMENT.,"The infernal powers with strains of heavenly love,"
9319,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than mine, in ornamental verse to dress                     400"
9320,THE ARGUMENT.,The harshest sounds that terms of art express:
9321,THE ARGUMENT.,Such arduous toil sage Dædalus endured
9322,THE ARGUMENT.,"In mazes, self-invented, long immured,"
9323,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till genius her superior aid bestow'd,"
9324,THE ARGUMENT.,To guide him through that intricate abode--
9325,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, long imprison'd in a rugged way"
9326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where Phoebus' daughters never aim'd to stray,"
9327,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Muse, that tuned to barbarous sounds her string,"
9328,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now spreads, like Dædalus, a bolder wing;"
9329,THE ARGUMENT.,"The verse begins in softer strains to flow,                 410"
9330,THE ARGUMENT.,Replete with sad variety of woe.
9331,THE ARGUMENT.,"As yet, amid this elemental war,"
9332,THE ARGUMENT.,Where Desolation in his gloomy car
9333,THE ARGUMENT.,"Triumphant rages round the starless void,"
9334,THE ARGUMENT.,And Fate on every billow seems to ride;
9335,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor toil, nor hazard, nor distress appear"
9336,THE ARGUMENT.,To sink the seamen with unmanly fear.
9337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though their firm hearts no pageant-honour boast,"
9338,THE ARGUMENT.,They scorn the wretch that trembles at his post;
9339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who from the face of danger strives to turn,               420"
9340,THE ARGUMENT.,Indignant from the social hour they spurn:
9341,THE ARGUMENT.,Though now full oft they felt the raging tide
9342,THE ARGUMENT.,In proud rebellion climb the vessel's side;
9343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though every rising wave more dreadful grows,"
9344,THE ARGUMENT.,And in succession dire the deck o'erflows;
9345,THE ARGUMENT.,"No future ills unknown their souls appal,"
9346,THE ARGUMENT.,"They know no danger, or they scorn it all:"
9347,THE ARGUMENT.,"But even the generous spirits of the brave,"
9348,THE ARGUMENT.,"Subdued by toil, a friendly respite crave;"
9349,THE ARGUMENT.,"They, with severe fatigue alone opprest,                   430"
9350,THE ARGUMENT.,Would fain indulge an interval of rest.
9351,THE ARGUMENT.,Far other cares the master's mind employ;
9352,THE ARGUMENT.,Approaching perils all his hopes destroy.
9353,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain he spreads the graduated chart,"
9354,THE ARGUMENT.,And bounds the distance by the rules of art;
9355,THE ARGUMENT.,Across the geometric plane expands
9356,THE ARGUMENT.,The compasses to circumjacent lands:
9357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ungrateful task! for, no asylum found,"
9358,THE ARGUMENT.,Death yawns on every leeward shore around.--
9359,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Albert thus, with horrid doubts dismay'd,            440"
9360,THE ARGUMENT.,The geometric distances survey'd;
9361,THE ARGUMENT.,"On deck the watchful Rodmond cries aloud,"
9362,THE ARGUMENT.,Secure your lives! grasp every man a shroud--
9363,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roused from his trance, he mounts with eyes aghast;"
9364,THE ARGUMENT.,"When o'er the ship, in undulation vast,"
9365,THE ARGUMENT.,"A giant surge down rushes from on high,"
9366,THE ARGUMENT.,And fore and aft dissever'd ruins lie.
9367,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when, Britannia's empire to maintain,"
9368,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great Hawke descends in thunder on the main,"
9369,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around the brazen voice of battle roars,                   450"
9370,THE ARGUMENT.,And fatal lightnings blast the hostile shores;
9371,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath the storm their shatter'd navies groan;
9372,THE ARGUMENT.,The trembling deep recoils from zone to zone--
9373,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus the torn vessel felt the enormous stroke,"
9374,THE ARGUMENT.,The boats beneath the thundering deluge broke;
9375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tom from their planks the cracking ring-bolts drew,"
9376,THE ARGUMENT.,And gripes and lashings all asunder flew;
9377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Companion, binnacle, in floating wreck,"
9378,THE ARGUMENT.,With compasses and glasses strew'd the deck;
9379,THE ARGUMENT.,"The balanced mizen, rending to the head,                   460"
9380,THE ARGUMENT.,In fluttering fragments from its bolt-rope fled;
9381,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sides convulsive shook on groaning beams,"
9382,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, rent with labour, yawn'd their pitchy seams."
9383,THE ARGUMENT.,"They sound the well, [42] and, terrible to hear!"
9384,THE ARGUMENT.,Five feet immersed along the line appear:
9385,THE ARGUMENT.,"At either pump they ply the clanking brake, [43]"
9386,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, turn by turn, the ungrateful office take:"
9387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rodmond, Arion, and Palemon here"
9388,THE ARGUMENT.,At this sad task all diligent appear.
9389,THE ARGUMENT.,"As some strong citadel, begirt with foes,                  470"
9390,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tries long the tide of ruin to oppose,"
9391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Destruction near her spreads his black array,"
9392,THE ARGUMENT.,And death and sorrow mark his horrid way;
9393,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, in some destined hour, against her wall"
9394,THE ARGUMENT.,In tenfold rage the fatal thunders fall:
9395,THE ARGUMENT.,It breaks! it bursts before the cannonade!
9396,THE ARGUMENT.,And following hosts the shatter'd domes invade:
9397,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her inmates long repel the hostile flood,"
9398,THE ARGUMENT.,And shield their sacred charge in streams of blood:
9399,THE ARGUMENT.,"So the brave mariners their pumps attend,                  480"
9400,THE ARGUMENT.,"And help incessant, by rotation, lend;"
9401,THE ARGUMENT.,"But all in vain! for now the sounding cord,"
9402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Updrawn, an undiminish'd depth explored."
9403,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor this severe distress is found alone,"
9404,THE ARGUMENT.,The ribs opprest by ponderous cannon groan;
9405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep rolling from the watery volume's height,"
9406,THE ARGUMENT.,The tortured sides seem bursting with their weight--
9407,THE ARGUMENT.,"So reels Pelorus with convulsive throes,"
9408,THE ARGUMENT.,When in his veins the burning earthquake glows;
9409,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hoarse through his entrails roars the infernal flame,      490"
9410,THE ARGUMENT.,And central thunders rend his groaning frame--
9411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Accumulated mischiefs thus arise,"
9412,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fate, vindictive, all their skill defies:"
9413,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this, one remedy is only known,"
9414,THE ARGUMENT.,From the torn ship her metal must be thrown;
9415,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eventful task! which last distress requires,"
9416,THE ARGUMENT.,And dread of instant death alone inspires:
9417,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while intent the yawning decks to ease,"
9418,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fill'd ever and anon with rushing seas,"
9419,THE ARGUMENT.,Some fatal billow with recoiling sweep                     500
9420,THE ARGUMENT.,May whirl the helpless wretches in the deep.
9421,THE ARGUMENT.,No season this for counsel or delay;
9422,THE ARGUMENT.,Too soon the eventful moments haste away!
9423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here perseverance, with each help of art,"
9424,THE ARGUMENT.,Must join the boldest efforts of the heart:
9425,THE ARGUMENT.,"These only now their misery can relieve,"
9426,THE ARGUMENT.,These only now a dawn of safety give.
9427,THE ARGUMENT.,"While o'er the quivering deck, from van to rear,"

9430,THE ARGUMENT.,This office in the face of death pursue:
9431,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wheel'd artillery o'er the deck to guide,"
9432,THE ARGUMENT.,Rodmond descending claim'd the weather-side;
9433,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fearless of heart the chief his orders gave,"
9434,THE ARGUMENT.,Fronting the rude assaults of every wave--
9435,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like some strong watch-tower nodding o'er the deep,"
9436,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose rocky base the foaming waters sweep,"
9437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Untamed he stood; the stern aerial war,"
9438,THE ARGUMENT.,Had mark'd his honest face with many a scar
9439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meanwhile Arion, traversing the waist, [44]                520"
9440,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cordage of the leeward guns unbraced,"
9441,THE ARGUMENT.,And pointed crows beneath the metal placed.
9442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Watching the roll, their forelocks they withdrew,"
9443,THE ARGUMENT.,And from their beds the reeling cannon threw;
9444,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, from the windward battlements unbound,"
9445,THE ARGUMENT.,Rodmond's associates wheel'd the artillery round;

9447,THE ARGUMENT.,The ponderous arms across the steep defile:
9448,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, hurl'd from sounding hinges o'er the side"
9449,THE ARGUMENT.,Thundering they plunge into the flashing tide.             530
9450,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship, thus eased, some little respite finds"
9451,THE ARGUMENT.,In this rude conflict of the seas and winds--
9452,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such ease Alcides felt, when, clogg'd with gore,"
9453,THE ARGUMENT.,The envenom'd mantle from his side he tore;
9454,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, stung with burning pain, he strove too late"
9455,THE ARGUMENT.,To stop the swift career of cruel fate;
9456,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet then his heart one ray of hope procured,"
9457,THE ARGUMENT.,Sad harbinger of sevenfold pangs endured--
9458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such, and so short, the pause of woe she found!"
9459,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cimmerian darkness shades the deep around,                 540"

9461,THE ARGUMENT.,Deluge the cheerless gloom with horrid rays:

9463,THE ARGUMENT.,With grim destruction threatens all below;
9464,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beneath, the storm-lash'd surges furious rise,"
9465,THE ARGUMENT.,And wave uproll'd on wave assails the skies;
9466,THE ARGUMENT.,With ever-floating bulwarks they surround
9467,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship, half-swallow'd in the black profound."
9468,THE ARGUMENT.,"With ceaseless hazard and fatigue oppress'd,"
9469,THE ARGUMENT.,Dismay and anguish every heart possess'd;                  550
9470,THE ARGUMENT.,"For while, with sweeping inundation, o'er"
9471,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sea-beat ship the booming waters roar,"
9472,THE ARGUMENT.,"Displaced beneath by her capacious womb,"
9473,THE ARGUMENT.,They rage their ancient station to resume;
9474,THE ARGUMENT.,"By secret ambushes, their force to prove,"
9475,THE ARGUMENT.,Through many a winding channel first they rove;
9476,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till gathering fury, like the fever'd blood,"
9477,THE ARGUMENT.,Through her dark veins they roll a rapid flood:
9478,THE ARGUMENT.,"When unrelenting thus the leaks they found,"
9479,THE ARGUMENT.,The clattering pumps with clanking strokes resound;        560
9480,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around each leaping valve, by toil subdued,"
9481,THE ARGUMENT.,The tough bull-hide must ever be renew'd:
9482,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their sinking hearts unusual horrors chill,"
9483,THE ARGUMENT.,And down their weary limbs thick dews distil;
9484,THE ARGUMENT.,"No ray of light their dying hope redeems,"
9485,THE ARGUMENT.,Pregnant with some new woe each moment teems.
9486,THE ARGUMENT.,"Again the chief the instructive chart extends,"
9487,THE ARGUMENT.,And o'er the figured plane attentive bends;
9488,THE ARGUMENT.,"To him the motion of each orb was known,"
9489,THE ARGUMENT.,That wheels around the sun's refulgent throne.             570
9490,THE ARGUMENT.,"But here, alas! his science nought avails,"

9501,THE ARGUMENT.,Nine lessening leagues beneath the leeward bow:
9502,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, if on those destructive shallows tost,"
9503,THE ARGUMENT.,The helpless bark with all her crew are lost:
9504,THE ARGUMENT.,"As fatal still appears, that danger o'er,"

9512,THE ARGUMENT.,"No blazon'd trophies o'er their concave spread,"
9513,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor storied pillars raised aloft their head:
9514,THE ARGUMENT.,But here the Queen of shade around them threw
9515,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her dragon wing, disastrous to the view!"
9516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dire was the scene with whirlwind, hail, and shower;"
9517,THE ARGUMENT.,Black melancholy ruled the fearful hour:
9518,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beneath, tremendous roll'd the flashing tide,"
9519,THE ARGUMENT.,Where fate on every billow seem'd to ride--               600
9520,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enclosed with ills, by peril unsubdued,"
9521,THE ARGUMENT.,Great in distress the master-seaman stood!
9522,THE ARGUMENT.,Skill'd to command; deliberate to advise;
9523,THE ARGUMENT.,Expert in action; and in council wise--
9524,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus to his partners, by the crew unheard,"
9525,THE ARGUMENT.,The dictates of his soul the chief referr'd:
9526,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Ye faithful mates! who all my troubles share,"
9527,THE ARGUMENT.,Approved companions of your master's care!
9528,THE ARGUMENT.,"To you, alas! 'twere fruitless now to tell"
9529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our sad distress, already known too well:                  610"
9530,THE ARGUMENT.,"This morn with favouring gales the port we left,"
9531,THE ARGUMENT.,Though now of every flattering hope bereft:
9532,THE ARGUMENT.,No skill nor long experience could forecast
9533,THE ARGUMENT.,The unseen approach of this destructive blast:
9534,THE ARGUMENT.,"These seas, where storms at various seasons blow,"
9535,THE ARGUMENT.,No reigning winds nor certain omens know--
9536,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hour, the occasion, all your skill demands,"
9537,THE ARGUMENT.,"A leaky ship, embay'd by dangerous lands!"
9538,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our bark no transient jeopardy surrounds,"
9539,THE ARGUMENT.,Groaning she lies beneath unnumber'd wounds:               620
9540,THE ARGUMENT.,"'Tis ours the doubtful remedy to find,"
9541,THE ARGUMENT.,To shun the fury of the seas and wind;
9542,THE ARGUMENT.,"For in this hollow swell, with labour sore,"
9543,THE ARGUMENT.,Her flank can bear the bursting floods no more.
9544,THE ARGUMENT.,"One only shift, though desperate, we must try,"
9545,THE ARGUMENT.,And that before the boisterous storm to fly:
9546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then less her sides will feel the surges' power,"
9547,THE ARGUMENT.,Which thus may soon the foundering hull devour.
9548,THE ARGUMENT.,'Tis true the vessel and her costly freight
9549,THE ARGUMENT.,"To me consign'd, my orders only wait;                      630"

9551,THE ARGUMENT.,To equal votes our counsels I resign--
9552,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forbid it, Heaven! that in this dreadful hour"
9553,THE ARGUMENT.,I claim the dangerous reins of purblind power!
9554,THE ARGUMENT.,"But should we now resolve to bear away,"
9555,THE ARGUMENT.,Our hopeless state can suffer no delay:
9556,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor can we, thus bereft of every sail,"
9557,THE ARGUMENT.,Attempt to steer obliquely on the gale;
9558,THE ARGUMENT.,"For then, if broaching sideway to the sea,"
9559,THE ARGUMENT.,Our dropsied ship may founder by the lee;                  640
9560,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vain all endeavours then to bear away,"
9561,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor helm, nor pilot, would she more obey."""
9562,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, the listening mates with fix'd regard"
9563,THE ARGUMENT.,And silent reverence his opinion heard.
9564,THE ARGUMENT.,"Important was the question in debate,"
9565,THE ARGUMENT.,And o'er their counsels hung impending fate:
9566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rodmond, in many a scene of peril tried,"
9567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had oft the master's happier skill descried,"
9568,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet now, the hour, the scene, the occasion known,"
9569,THE ARGUMENT.,Perhaps with equal right preferr'd his own:                650
9570,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of long experience in the naval art,"
9571,THE ARGUMENT.,Blunt was his speech and naked was his heart;
9572,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alike to him each climate, and each blast,"
9573,THE ARGUMENT.,"The first in danger, in retreat the last:"
9574,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sagacious, balancing the opposed events,"
9575,THE ARGUMENT.,From Albert his opinion thus dissents:--
9576,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Too true the perils of the present hour,"
9577,THE ARGUMENT.,Where toils succeeding toils our strength o'erpower!
9578,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our bark, 'tis true, no shelter here can find,"
9579,THE ARGUMENT.,Sore shatter'd by the ruffian seas and wind:               660
9580,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet where with safety can we dare to scud
9581,THE ARGUMENT.,Before this tempest and pursuing flood?
9582,THE ARGUMENT.,"At random driven, to present death we haste,"
9583,THE ARGUMENT.,And one short hour perhaps may be our last.
9584,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though Corinth's gulf extend along the lee,"
9585,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whose safe ports appears a passage free,"
9586,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet think! this furious unremitting gale
9587,THE ARGUMENT.,Deprives the ship of every ruling sail;
9588,THE ARGUMENT.,"And if before it she directly flies,"
9589,THE ARGUMENT.,"New ills enclose us, and new dangers rise:                 670"

9592,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our hull, if once it strikes that iron coast,"
9593,THE ARGUMENT.,"Asunder bursts, in instant ruin lost;"
9594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor she alone, but with her all the crew,"
9595,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beyond relief, are doom'd to perish too:"
9596,THE ARGUMENT.,Such mischiefs follow if we bear away;
9597,THE ARGUMENT.,O safer that sad refuge--to delay!
9598,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Then of our purpose this appears the scope,"
9599,THE ARGUMENT.,To weigh the danger with the doubtful hope:                680
9600,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though sorely buffeted by every sea,"
9601,THE ARGUMENT.,Our hull unbroken long may try a-lee;
9602,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crew, though harass'd much with toils severe,"
9603,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still at their pumps, perceive no hazards near:"
9604,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall we, incautious, then the danger tell,"
9605,THE ARGUMENT.,At once their courage and their hope to quell?
9606,THE ARGUMENT.,Prudence forbids! this southern tempest soon
9607,THE ARGUMENT.,May change its quarter with the changing moon;
9608,THE ARGUMENT.,"Its rage, though terrible, may soon subside,"
9609,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor into mountains lash the unruly tide;                   690
9610,THE ARGUMENT.,These leaks shall then decrease--the sails once more
9611,THE ARGUMENT.,"Direct our course to some relieving shore."""
9612,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he spoke, around from man to man"

9615,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above, below, the invading water drinks,"
9616,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sounding her depth they eyed the wetted scale,"
9617,THE ARGUMENT.,And lo! the leaks o'er all their powers prevail:
9618,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet at their post, by terrors unsubdued,"
9619,THE ARGUMENT.,They with redoubling force their task pursued.             700
9620,THE ARGUMENT.,And now the senior pilots seem'd to wait
9621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arion's voice, to close the dark debate."
9622,THE ARGUMENT.,Not o'er his vernal life the ripening sun

9624,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slow to debate, yet eager to excel,"
9625,THE ARGUMENT.,"In thy sad school, stern Neptune! taught too well:"
9626,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lasting pain to rend his youthful heart,"
9627,THE ARGUMENT.,Dire fate in venom dipp'd her keenest dart;
9628,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till his firm spirit, temper'd long to ill,"
9629,THE ARGUMENT.,Forgot her persecuting scourge to feel;                    710
9630,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the horrors, that around him roll,"
9631,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus rouse to action his rekindling soul:
9632,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Can we, delay'd in this tremendous tide,"
9633,THE ARGUMENT.,A moment pause what purpose to decide?
9634,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alas! from circling horrors thus combined,"
9635,THE ARGUMENT.,One method of relief alone we find:
9636,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus water-logg'd, thus helpless to remain"
9637,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid this hollow, how ill judged! how vain!"
9638,THE ARGUMENT.,Our sea-breach'd vessel can no longer bear
9639,THE ARGUMENT.,The floods that o'er her burst in dread career;            720
9640,THE ARGUMENT.,The labouring hull already seems half-fill'd
9641,THE ARGUMENT.,With water through a hundred leaks distill'd;
9642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus drench'd by every wave, her riven deck,"
9643,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stript and defenceless, floats a naked wreck;"
9644,THE ARGUMENT.,At every pitch the o'erwhelming billows bend
9645,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath their load the quivering bowsprit's end;
9646,THE ARGUMENT.,A fearful warning! since the masts on high
9647,THE ARGUMENT.,On that support with trembling hope rely;
9648,THE ARGUMENT.,"At either pump our seamen pant for breath,"
9649,THE ARGUMENT.,In dire dismay anticipating death;                         730
9650,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still all our powers the increasing leaks defy,"
9651,THE ARGUMENT.,"We sink at sea, no shore, no haven nigh."
9652,THE ARGUMENT.,"One dawn of hope yet breaks athwart the gloom,"
9653,THE ARGUMENT.,To light and save us from a watery tomb;
9654,THE ARGUMENT.,"That bids us shun the death impending here,"
9655,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fly from the following blast, and shoreward steer."
9656,THE ARGUMENT.,"""'Tis urged indeed, the fury of the gale"
9657,THE ARGUMENT.,Precludes the help of every guiding sail;
9658,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, driven before it on the watery waste,"
9659,THE ARGUMENT.,To rocky shores and scenes of death we haste;              740
9660,THE ARGUMENT.,"But haply Falconera we may shun,"
9661,THE ARGUMENT.,And long to Grecian coasts is yet the run:
9662,THE ARGUMENT.,"Less harass'd then, our scudding ship may bear"
9663,THE ARGUMENT.,The assaulting surge repell'd upon her rear;
9664,THE ARGUMENT.,And since as soon that tempest may decay
9665,THE ARGUMENT.,When steering shoreward--wherefore thus delay?
9666,THE ARGUMENT.,Should we at last be driven by dire decree
9667,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too near the fatal margin of the sea,"
9668,THE ARGUMENT.,The hull dismasted there awhile may ride
9669,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lengthen'd cables, on the raging tide;                750"
9670,THE ARGUMENT.,"Perhaps kind Heaven, with interposing power,"
9671,THE ARGUMENT.,May curb the tempest ere that dreadful hour;
9672,THE ARGUMENT.,"But here, ingulf'd and foundering, while we stay,"
9673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fate hovers o'er, and marks us for her prey."""
9674,THE ARGUMENT.,He said: Palemon saw with grief of heart
9675,THE ARGUMENT.,The storm prevailing o'er the pilot's art;
9676,THE ARGUMENT.,"In silent terror and distress involved,"
9677,THE ARGUMENT.,He heard their last alternative resolved:
9678,THE ARGUMENT.,"High beat his bosom. With such fear subdued,"
9679,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beneath the gloom of some enchanted wood,                  760"
9680,THE ARGUMENT.,Oft in old time the wandering swain explored
9681,THE ARGUMENT.,The midnight wizards' breathing rites abhorr'd;
9682,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembling, approach'd their incantations fell,"
9683,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, chill'd with horror, heard the songs of hell."
9684,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arion saw, with secret anguish moved,"
9685,THE ARGUMENT.,"The deep affliction, of the friend he loved,"
9686,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, all awake to friendship's genial heat,"
9687,THE ARGUMENT.,His bosom felt consenting tremors beat:
9688,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alas! no season this for tender love,"
9689,THE ARGUMENT.,Far hence the music of the myrtle grove--                 770
9690,THE ARGUMENT.,He tried with soft persuasion's melting lore
9691,THE ARGUMENT.,Palemon's fainting courage to restore;
9692,THE ARGUMENT.,"His wounded spirit heal'd with friendship's balm,"
9693,THE ARGUMENT.,And bade each conflict of the mind be calm.
9694,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now had the pilots all the events revolved,"
9695,THE ARGUMENT.,And on their final refuge thus resolved--
9696,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, like the faithful shepherd who beholds"
9697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some prowling wolf approach his fleecy folds,"
9698,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the brave crew, whom racking doubts perplex,"
9699,THE ARGUMENT.,The dreadful purpose Albert thus directs:                  780
9700,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Unhappy partners in a wayward fate!"
9701,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose courage now is known perhaps too late;

9703,THE ARGUMENT.,In conflict all the rolling deep deform:
9704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, patient in adversity, still bear"
9705,THE ARGUMENT.,The firmest front when greatest ills are near;
9706,THE ARGUMENT.,"The truth, though painful, I must now reveal,"
9707,THE ARGUMENT.,That long in vain I purposed to conceal:
9708,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ingulf'd, all help of art we vainly try,"
9709,THE ARGUMENT.,"To weather leeward shores, alas! too nigh:                 790"
9710,THE ARGUMENT.,Our crazy bark no longer can abide
9711,THE ARGUMENT.,"The seas, that thunder o'er her batter'd side:"
9712,THE ARGUMENT.,And while the leaks a fatal warning give
9713,THE ARGUMENT.,"That in this raging sea she cannot live,"
9714,THE ARGUMENT.,One only refuge from despair we find--
9715,THE ARGUMENT.,"At once to wear, and scud before the wind."
9716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Perhaps even then to ruin we may steer,"
9717,THE ARGUMENT.,For rocky shores beneath our lee appear;
9718,THE ARGUMENT.,"But that's remote, and instant death is here:"
9719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet there, by Heaven's assistance, we may gain             800"
9720,THE ARGUMENT.,Some creek or inlet of the Grecian main;
9721,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, shelter'd by some rock, at anchor ride"
9722,THE ARGUMENT.,Till with abating rage the blast subside:
9723,THE ARGUMENT.,"But if, determined by the will of Heaven,"
9724,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our helpless bark at last ashore is driven,"
9725,THE ARGUMENT.,"These councils, follow'd, from a watery grave"
9726,THE ARGUMENT.,Our crew perhaps amid the surf may save:--
9727,THE ARGUMENT.,"""And first, let all our axes be secured,"
9728,THE ARGUMENT.,To cut the masts and rigging from aboard;
9729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to the quarters bind each plank and oar,              810"
9730,THE ARGUMENT.,To float between the vessel and the shore:
9731,THE ARGUMENT.,The longest cordage too must be convey'd
9732,THE ARGUMENT.,"On deck, and to the weather-rails belay'd:"
9733,THE ARGUMENT.,"So they who haply reach alive the land,"
9734,THE ARGUMENT.,"The extended lines may fasten on the strand,"
9735,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whene'er, loud thundering on the leeward shore,"
9736,THE ARGUMENT.,"While yet aloof, we hear the breakers roar"
9737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus for the terrible event prepared,"
9738,THE ARGUMENT.,Brace fore and aft to starboard every yard;
9739,THE ARGUMENT.,"So shall our masts swim lighter on the wave,               820"
9740,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the broken rocks our seamen save;
9741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then westward turn the stem, that every mast"
9742,THE ARGUMENT.,May shoreward fall as from the vessel cast.
9743,THE ARGUMENT.,"When o'er her side once more the billows bound,"
9744,THE ARGUMENT.,Ascend the rigging till she strikes the ground;

9746,THE ARGUMENT.,"That strikes her bottom on some pointed rock,"
9747,THE ARGUMENT.,"The boldest of our sailors must descend,"
9748,THE ARGUMENT.,The dangerous business of the deck to tend:
9749,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then burst the hatches off, and every stay                 830"
9750,THE ARGUMENT.,And every fastening laniard cut away;
9751,THE ARGUMENT.,"Planks, gratings, booms, and rafts to leeward cast;"
9752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then with redoubled strokes attack each mast,"
9753,THE ARGUMENT.,That buoyant lumber may sustain you o'er
9754,THE ARGUMENT.,The rocky shelves and ledges to the shore:
9755,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, as your firmest succour, till the last"
9756,THE ARGUMENT.,O cling securely on each faithful mast!
9757,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though great the danger, and the task severe,"

10165,THE ARGUMENT.,And glow'd congenial with the swelling lay;
10166,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roused from the chaos of primeval night,"
10167,THE ARGUMENT.,At once fair truth and reason sprung to light.
10168,THE ARGUMENT.,"When great Mæonides, in rapid song,"
10169,THE ARGUMENT.,"The thundering tide of battle rolls along,"
10170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each ravish'd bosom feels the high alarms,"
10171,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the burning pulses beat to arms;

10174,THE ARGUMENT.,But when his strings with mournful magic tell
10175,THE ARGUMENT.,"What dire distress Laertes' son befell,"
10176,THE ARGUMENT.,"The strains, meandering through the maze of woe"

10183,THE ARGUMENT.,Allures and guides to climb Olympian heights.               30
10184,THE ARGUMENT.,"But I, alas! through scenes bewilder'd stray,"
10185,THE ARGUMENT.,Far from the light of his unerring ray;

10187,THE ARGUMENT.,Darkling I wander with prophetic dread.
10188,THE ARGUMENT.,To me in vain the bold Mæonian lyre
10189,THE ARGUMENT.,Awakes the numbers fraught with living fire;

10248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now launching headlong down the horrid vale,"
10249,THE ARGUMENT.,Becalm'd she hears no more the howling gale;
10250,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till up the dreadful height again she flies,"
10251,THE ARGUMENT.,Trembling beneath the current of the skies.
10252,THE ARGUMENT.,"As that rebellious angel, who, from heaven,                 100"
10253,THE ARGUMENT.,"To regions of eternal pain was driven,"
10254,THE ARGUMENT.,When dreadless he forsook the Stygian shore
10255,THE ARGUMENT.,The distant realms of Eden to explore;
10256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, on sulphureous clouds sublime upheaved,"
10257,THE ARGUMENT.,With daring wing the infernal air he cleaved;
10258,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, in some hideous gulf descending prone,"
10259,THE ARGUMENT.,Far in the void abrupt of night was thrown--
10260,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even so she climbs the briny mountain's height,"
10261,THE ARGUMENT.,Then down the black abyss precipitates her flight:
10262,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mast, about whose tops the whirlwinds sing,             110"
10263,THE ARGUMENT.,With long vibration round her axle swing.
10264,THE ARGUMENT.,"To guide her wayward course amid the gloom,"
10265,THE ARGUMENT.,The watchful pilots different posts assume:
10266,THE ARGUMENT.,"Albert and Rodmond on the poop appear,"
10267,THE ARGUMENT.,There to direct each guiding timoneer;
10268,THE ARGUMENT.,"While at the bow the watch Arion keeps,"
10269,THE ARGUMENT.,To shun what cruisers wander o'er the deeps:
10270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where'er he moves Palemon still attends,"
10271,THE ARGUMENT.,As if on him his only hope depends;
10272,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Rodmond, fearful of some neighbouring shore,          120"
10273,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cries, ever and anon, Look out afore!"
10274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus o'er the flood four hours she scudding flew,"
10275,THE ARGUMENT.,When Falconera's rugged cliffs they view
10276,THE ARGUMENT.,"Faintly along the larboard bow descried,"
10277,THE ARGUMENT.,As o'er its mountain tops the lightnings glide;
10278,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o'er its summit, through the gloom of night,"

10293,THE ARGUMENT.,In gentler tides our feverish pulses beat:
10294,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such transient pleasure, as they pass'd this strand,"
10295,THE ARGUMENT.,A moment bade their throbbing hearts expand;

10500,THE ARGUMENT.,With golden harps and branching laurels graced:
10501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around the fane, engraved by Vulcan's hand,"
10502,THE ARGUMENT.,The sciences and arts were seen to stand;
10503,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Æsculapius' snake display'd his crest,                 350"
10504,THE ARGUMENT.,And burning glories sparkled on his breast;
10505,THE ARGUMENT.,"While from his eye's insufferable light,"
10506,THE ARGUMENT.,Disease and death recoil'd in headlong flight:
10507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of this great temple, through all time renown'd,"
10508,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sunk in oblivion, no remains are found."
10509,THE ARGUMENT.,"Contiguous here, with hallow'd woods o'erspread,"
10510,THE ARGUMENT.,Renown'd Parnassus lifts its honour'd head;
10511,THE ARGUMENT.,"There roses blossom in eternal spring,"
10512,THE ARGUMENT.,And strains celestial feather'd warblers sing;
10513,THE ARGUMENT.,Apollo here bestows the unfading wreath;                    360
10514,THE ARGUMENT.,Here Zephyrs aromatic odours breathe;
10515,THE ARGUMENT.,"They o'er Castalian plains diffuse perfume,"
10516,THE ARGUMENT.,Where round the scene perennial laurels bloom:
10517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fair daughters of the sun, the sacred Nine!"
10518,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here wake to ecstasy their harps divine,"
10519,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or bid the Paphian lute mellifluous play,"
10520,THE ARGUMENT.,And tune to plaintive lore the liquid lay:
10521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their numbers every mental storm control,"
10522,THE ARGUMENT.,And lull to harmony the afflicted soul;
10523,THE ARGUMENT.,"With heavenly balm the tortured breast compose,             370"
10524,THE ARGUMENT.,And soothe the agony of latent woes:
10525,THE ARGUMENT.,"The verdant shades that Helicon surround,"
10526,THE ARGUMENT.,On rosy gales seraphic tunes resound!
10527,THE ARGUMENT.,"Perpetual summers crown the happy hours,"
10528,THE ARGUMENT.,Sweet as the breath that fans Elysian flowers:
10529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hence pleasure dances in an endless round,"
10530,THE ARGUMENT.,"And love and joy, ineffable, abound."
10531,THE ARGUMENT.,"IV.     Stop, wandering thought! methinks I feel their strains"
10532,THE ARGUMENT.,Diffuse delicious languor through my veins.
10533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adieu, ye flowery vales, and fragrant scenes,               380"
10534,THE ARGUMENT.,"Delightful bowers, and ever vernal greens!"
10535,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adieu, ye streams! that o'er enchanted ground"
10536,THE ARGUMENT.,In lucid maze the Aonian hill surround;
10537,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye fairy scenes! where fancy loves to dwell,"
10538,THE ARGUMENT.,"And young delight, for ever, oh, farewell!"
10539,THE ARGUMENT.,"The soul with tender luxury you fill,"
10540,THE ARGUMENT.,And o'er the sense Lethean dews distil--
10541,THE ARGUMENT.,"Awake, O memory! from the inglorious dream,"
10542,THE ARGUMENT.,With brazen lungs resume the kindling theme;
10543,THE ARGUMENT.,"Collect thy powers, arouse thy vital fire,                  390"
10544,THE ARGUMENT.,Ye spirits of the storm my verse inspire!
10545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hoarse as the whirlwinds that enrage the main,"
10546,THE ARGUMENT.,In torrents pour along the swelling strain.
10547,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, through the parting wave impetuous bore,"
10548,THE ARGUMENT.,The scudding vessel stemm'd the Athenian shore;
10549,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pilots, as the waves behind her swell,"
10550,THE ARGUMENT.,Still with the wheeling stern their force repel;
10551,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this assault should either quarter [3] feel,"
10552,THE ARGUMENT.,Again to flank the tempest she might reel!
10553,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steersmen every bidden turn apply,"
10554,THE ARGUMENT.,To right and left the spokes alternate fly--              400
10555,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when some conquer'd host retreats in fear,"
10556,THE ARGUMENT.,The bravest leaders guard the broken rear;
10557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Indignant they retire, and long oppose"
10558,THE ARGUMENT.,Superior armies that around them close;
10559,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still shield the flanks, the routed squadrons join,"
10560,THE ARGUMENT.,And guide the flight in one continued line.
10561,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus they direct the flying bark before
10562,THE ARGUMENT.,"The impelling floods, that lash her to the shore:"
10563,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o'er the poop the audacious seas aspire,               410"
10564,THE ARGUMENT.,Uproll'd in hills of fluctuating fire;
10565,THE ARGUMENT.,"With labouring throes she rolls on either side,"
10566,THE ARGUMENT.,And dips her gunnels in the yawning tide;
10567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her joints, unhinged, in palsied languors play,"
10568,THE ARGUMENT.,As ice-flakes part beneath the noontide ray.
10569,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gale howls doleful through the blocks and shrouds,"
10570,THE ARGUMENT.,And big rain pours a deluge from the clouds;
10571,THE ARGUMENT.,"From wintry magazines that sweep the sky,"
10572,THE ARGUMENT.,Descending globes of hail impetuous fly;
10573,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on the masts, with pale and livid rays,                420"
10574,THE ARGUMENT.,Amid the gloom portentous meteors blaze;
10575,THE ARGUMENT.,The ethereal dome in mournful pomp array'd
10576,THE ARGUMENT.,Now buried lies beneath impervious shade;
10577,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, flashing round intolerable light,"
10578,THE ARGUMENT.,Redoubles all the horror of the night--
10579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such terror Sinai's trembling hill o'erspread,"
10580,THE ARGUMENT.,When Heaven's loud trumpet sounded o'er its head:
10581,THE ARGUMENT.,"It seem'd, the wrathful Angel of the wind"
10582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had all the horrors of the skies combined,"
10583,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here, to one ill-fated ship opposed,                    430"
10584,THE ARGUMENT.,At once the dreadful magazine disclosed;
10585,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lo! tremendous o'er the deep he springs,"
10586,THE ARGUMENT.,The inflaming sulphur flashing from his wings;
10587,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hark! his strong voice the dismal silence breaks,"
10588,THE ARGUMENT.,Mad chaos from the chains of death awakes:
10589,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loud, and more loud, the rolling peals enlarge,"
10590,THE ARGUMENT.,And blue on deck the fiery tides discharge;
10591,THE ARGUMENT.,"There all aghast the shivering wretches stood,"
10592,THE ARGUMENT.,While chill suspense and fear congeal'd their blood;
10593,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wide bursts in dazzling sheets the living flame,            440"
10594,THE ARGUMENT.,And dread concussion rends the ethereal frame;
10595,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sick earth convulsive groans from shore to shore,"
10596,THE ARGUMENT.,"And nature, shuddering, feels the horrid roar."
10597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still the sad prospect rises on my sight,"
10598,THE ARGUMENT.,Reveal'd in all its mournful shade and light;
10599,THE ARGUMENT.,Even now my ear with quick vibration feels
10600,THE ARGUMENT.,The explosion burst in strong rebounding peals;
10601,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift through my pulses glides the kindling fire,"
10602,THE ARGUMENT.,As lightning glances on the electric wire:
10603,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, ah! the languid colours vainly strive                  450"
10604,THE ARGUMENT.,To bid the scene in native hues revive.
10605,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, lo! at last, from tenfold darkness born,"
10606,THE ARGUMENT.,Forth issues o'er the wave the weeping morn:
10607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hail, sacred vision! who, on orient wings,"
10608,THE ARGUMENT.,The cheering dawn of light propitious brings;
10609,THE ARGUMENT.,"All nature, smiling, hail'd the vivid ray"
10610,THE ARGUMENT.,That gave her beauties to returning day--
10611,THE ARGUMENT.,"All but our ship! which, groaning on the tide,"
10612,THE ARGUMENT.,"No kind relief, no gleam of hope descried;"
10613,THE ARGUMENT.,For now in front her trembling inmates see                  460
10614,THE ARGUMENT.,The hills of Greece emerging on the lee.
10615,THE ARGUMENT.,"So the lost lover views that fatal morn,"
10616,THE ARGUMENT.,"On which, for ever from his bosom torn,"
10617,THE ARGUMENT.,"The maid, adored, resigns her blooming charms,"
10618,THE ARGUMENT.,To bless with love some happier rival's arms.
10619,THE ARGUMENT.,So to Eliza [4] dawn'd that cruel day
10620,THE ARGUMENT.,"That tore Æneas from her sight away,"
10621,THE ARGUMENT.,"That saw him parting, never to return,"
10622,THE ARGUMENT.,Herself in funeral flames decreed to burn.
10623,THE ARGUMENT.,"O yet in clouds, thou genial source of light!               470"
10624,THE ARGUMENT.,Conceal thy radiant glories from our sight;
10625,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go, with thy smile adorn the happy plain,"
10626,THE ARGUMENT.,And gild the scenes where health and pleasure reign:
10627,THE ARGUMENT.,"But let not here, in scorn, thy wanton beam"
10628,THE ARGUMENT.,Insult the dreadful grandeur of my theme.
10629,THE ARGUMENT.,"While shoreward now the bounding vessel flies,"
10630,THE ARGUMENT.,Full in her van St George's cliffs arise;
10631,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o'er the rest a pointed crag is seen,"
10632,THE ARGUMENT.,That hung projecting o'er a mossy green;
10633,THE ARGUMENT.,"Huge breakers on the larboard bow appear,                   480"
10634,THE ARGUMENT.,And full a-head its eastern ledges bear:
10635,THE ARGUMENT.,"To steer more eastward Albert still commands,"
10636,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shun, if possible, the fatal strands--"
10637,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nearer and nearer now the danger grows,"
10638,THE ARGUMENT.,And all their skill relentless fates oppose;
10639,THE ARGUMENT.,"For while more eastward they direct the prow,"
10640,THE ARGUMENT.,Enormous waves the quivering deck o'erflow;
10641,THE ARGUMENT.,"While, as she wheels, unable to subdue"
10642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her sallies, still they dread her broaching-to: [5]"
10643,THE ARGUMENT.,Alarming thought! for now no more a-lee                     490
10644,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her trembling side could bear the mountain'd sea,"
10645,THE ARGUMENT.,"And if pursuing waves she scuds before,"
10646,THE ARGUMENT.,Headlong she runs upon the frightful shore;
10647,THE ARGUMENT.,"A shore, where shelves and hidden rocks abound,"
10648,THE ARGUMENT.,Where death in secret ambush lurks around.
10649,THE ARGUMENT.,Not half so dreadful to Æneas' eyes
10650,THE ARGUMENT.,"The straits of Sicily were seen to rise,"
10651,THE ARGUMENT.,When Palinurus from the helm descried
10652,THE ARGUMENT.,The rocks of Scylla on his eastern side;
10653,THE ARGUMENT.,"While in the west, with hideous yawn disclosed,             500"
10654,THE ARGUMENT.,His onward path Charybdis' gulf opposed:
10655,THE ARGUMENT.,"The double danger he alternate view'd,"
10656,THE ARGUMENT.,And cautiously his arduous track pursued.
10657,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, while to right and left destruction lies,"
10658,THE ARGUMENT.,Between the extremes the daring vessel flies;
10659,THE ARGUMENT.,With terrible irruption bursting o'er
10660,THE ARGUMENT.,"The marble cliffs, tremendous surges roar;"
10661,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hoarse through each winding creek the tempest raves,"
10662,THE ARGUMENT.,And hollow rocks repeat the groan of waves.
10663,THE ARGUMENT.,"Should once the bottom strike this cruel shore,             510"
10664,THE ARGUMENT.,The parting ship that instant is no more!
10665,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor she alone, but with her all the crew"
10666,THE ARGUMENT.,Beyond relief are doom'd to perish too:
10667,THE ARGUMENT.,"But haply she escapes the dreadful strand,"
10668,THE ARGUMENT.,Though scarce her length in distance from the land:
10669,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift as the weapon quits the Scythian bow,"
10670,THE ARGUMENT.,"She cleaves the burning billows with her prow,"
10671,THE ARGUMENT.,"And forward hurrying with impetuous haste,"
10672,THE ARGUMENT.,Borne on the tempest's wings the isle she past:
10673,THE ARGUMENT.,"With longing eyes, and agony of mind,                       520"
10674,THE ARGUMENT.,The sailors view this refuge left behind;
10675,THE ARGUMENT.,Happy to bribe with India's richest ore
10676,THE ARGUMENT.,A safe accession to that barren shore.
10677,THE ARGUMENT.,"When in the dark Peruvian mine confined,"
10678,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lost to the cheerful commerce of mankind,"
10679,THE ARGUMENT.,"The groaning captive wastes his life away,"
10680,THE ARGUMENT.,"For ever exiled from the realms of day,"
10681,THE ARGUMENT.,Not half such pangs his bosom agonize
10682,THE ARGUMENT.,When up to distant light he rolls his eyes!
10683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where the broad sun, in his diurnal way                     530"
10684,THE ARGUMENT.,Imparts to all beside his vivid ray;
10685,THE ARGUMENT.,"While, all forlorn, the victim pines in vain"
10686,THE ARGUMENT.,For scenes he never shall possess again.
10687,THE ARGUMENT.,"V.      But now Athenian mountains they descry,"
10688,THE ARGUMENT.,And o'er the surge Colonna frowns on high;
10689,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where marble columns, long by time defaced,"
10690,THE ARGUMENT.,Moss-cover'd on the lofty Cape are placed:
10691,THE ARGUMENT.,"There rear'd by fair devotion to sustain,"
10692,THE ARGUMENT.,"In elder times, Tritonia's sacred fane;"
10693,THE ARGUMENT.,"The circling beach in murderous form appears,               540"
10694,THE ARGUMENT.,Decisive goal of all their hopes and fears:
10695,THE ARGUMENT.,The seamen now in wild amazement see
10696,THE ARGUMENT.,The scene of ruin rise beneath their lee;
10697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift from their minds elapsed all dangers past,"
10698,THE ARGUMENT.,"As dumb with terror, they behold the last."
10699,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, while wing'd with ruin from on high,"
10700,THE ARGUMENT.,"Through the rent cloud the ragged lightnings fly,"
10701,THE ARGUMENT.,"A flash, quick glancing on the nerves of light,"
10702,THE ARGUMENT.,Struck the pale helmsman with eternal night:
10703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rodmond, who heard a piteous groan behind,                  550"
10704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Touch'd with compassion, gazed upon the blind;"
10705,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, while around his sad companions crowd,"
10706,THE ARGUMENT.,He guides the unhappy victim to the shroud:
10707,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Hie thee aloft, my gallant friend!"" he cries;"
10708,THE ARGUMENT.,"""Thy only succour on the mast relies."""
10709,THE ARGUMENT.,"The helm, bereft of half its vital force,"
10710,THE ARGUMENT.,Now scarce subdued the wild unbridled course;
10711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Quick to the abandon'd wheel Arion came,"
10712,THE ARGUMENT.,The ship's tempestuous sallies to reclaim:
10713,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vessel, while the dread event draws nigh,               560"
10714,THE ARGUMENT.,Seems more impatient o'er the waves to fly;
10715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fate spurs her on!--Thus, issuing from afar,"
10716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advances to the sun some blazing star,"
10717,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as it feels attraction's kindling force,"
10718,THE ARGUMENT.,Springs onward with accelerated course.
10719,THE ARGUMENT.,The moment fraught with fate approaches fast!
10720,THE ARGUMENT.,"While thronging sailors climb each quivering mast,"
10721,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship no longer now must stem the land,"
10722,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, Hard a starboard! is the last command:"
10723,THE ARGUMENT.,"While every suppliant voice to Heaven applies,              570"
10724,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prow, swift wheeling, to the westward flies;"
10725,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twelve sailors, on the fore-mast who depend,"
10726,THE ARGUMENT.,High on the platform of the top ascend--
10727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fatal retreat! for, while the plunging prow"
10728,THE ARGUMENT.,"Immerges headlong in the wave below,"
10729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down prest by watery weight the bowsprit bends,"
10730,THE ARGUMENT.,And from above the stem deep-crashing rends:
10731,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath her bow the floating ruins lie;
10732,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fore-mast totters, unsustain'd on high;"
10733,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the ship, forelifted by the sea,                    580"
10734,THE ARGUMENT.,Hurls the tall fabric backward o'er her lee;
10735,THE ARGUMENT.,"While, in the general wreck, the faithful stay"
10736,THE ARGUMENT.,Drags the main top-mast by the cap away:
10737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flung from the mast, the seamen strive in vain,"
10738,THE ARGUMENT.,"Through hostile floods, their vessel to regain;"
10739,THE ARGUMENT.,"Weak hope, alas! they buffet long the wave,"
10740,THE ARGUMENT.,And grasp at life though sinking in the grave;
10741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till all exhausted, and bereft of strength,"
10742,THE ARGUMENT.,O'erpower'd they yield to cruel fate at length;
10743,THE ARGUMENT.,The burying waters close around their head--               590
10744,THE ARGUMENT.,They sink! for ever number'd with the dead.
10745,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those who remain the weather shrouds embrace,"
10746,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor longer mourn their lost companions' case:
10747,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transfix'd with terror at the approaching doom,"
10748,THE ARGUMENT.,Self-pity in their breasts alone has room.
10749,THE ARGUMENT.,"Albert, and Rodmond, and Palemon, near,"
10750,THE ARGUMENT.,"With young Arion, on the mast appear:"
10751,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even they, amid the unspeakable distress,"
10752,THE ARGUMENT.,In every look distracting thoughts confess;
10753,THE ARGUMENT.,"In every vein the refluent blood congeals,                  600"
10754,THE ARGUMENT.,And every bosom mortal terror feels;
10755,THE ARGUMENT.,"Begirt with all the horrors of the main,"
10756,THE ARGUMENT.,"They view'd the adjacent shore, but view'd in vain."
10757,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such torments in the drear abodes of hell,"
10758,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where sad despair laments with rueful yell,--"
10759,THE ARGUMENT.,Such torments agonize the damned breast.
10760,THE ARGUMENT.,That sees remote the mansions of the blest.
10761,THE ARGUMENT.,"It comes! the dire catastrophe draws near,"
10762,THE ARGUMENT.,Lash'd furious on by destiny severe:
10763,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship hangs hovering on the verge of death,              610"
10764,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hell yawns, rocks rise, and breakers roar beneath!"
10765,THE ARGUMENT.,"O yet confirm my heart, ye powers above!"
10766,THE ARGUMENT.,This last tremendous shock of fate to prove;
10767,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tottering frame of reason yet sustain,"
10768,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor let this total havoc whirl my brain;
10769,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since I, all trembling in extreme distress,"
10770,THE ARGUMENT.,Must still the horrible result express.
10771,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain, alas! the sacred shades of yore"
10772,THE ARGUMENT.,Would arm the mind with philosophic lore;
10773,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain they'd teach us, at the latest breath               620"
10774,THE ARGUMENT.,To smile serene amid the pangs of death:
10775,THE ARGUMENT.,Immortal Zeno's self would trembling see
10776,THE ARGUMENT.,Inexorable fate beneath the lee;
10777,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Epictetus, at the sight, in vain"
10778,THE ARGUMENT.,Attempt his Stoic firmness to retain:
10779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had Socrates, for godlike virtue famed,"
10780,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wisest of the sons of men proclaim'd,"
10781,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spectator of such various horrors been,"
10782,THE ARGUMENT.,Even he had stagger'd at this dreadful scene.
10783,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain the cords and axes were prepared,                 630"
10784,THE ARGUMENT.,For every wave now smites the quivering yard;
10785,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o'er the ship they throw a dreadful shade,"
10786,THE ARGUMENT.,Then on her burst in terrible cascade;
10787,THE ARGUMENT.,"Across the founder'd deck o'erwhelming roar,"
10788,THE ARGUMENT.,"And foaming, swelling, bound upon the shore."
10789,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift up the mounting billow now she flies,"
10790,THE ARGUMENT.,Her shatter'd top half-buried in the skies;
10791,THE ARGUMENT.,"Borne o'er a latent reef the hull impends,"
10792,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thundering on the marble crags descends:
10793,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her ponderous bulk the dire concussion feels,               640"
10794,THE ARGUMENT.,And o'er upheaving surges wounded reels.
10795,THE ARGUMENT.,Again she plunges! hark! a second shock
10796,THE ARGUMENT.,Bilges the splitting vessel on the rock:
10797,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down on the vale of death, with dismal cries,"
10798,THE ARGUMENT.,The fated victims shuddering cast their eyes
10799,THE ARGUMENT.,In wild despair; while yet another stroke
10800,THE ARGUMENT.,With strong convulsion rends the solid oak:
10801,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ah, Heaven!--behold her crashing ribs divide!"
10802,THE ARGUMENT.,"She loosens, parts, and spreads in ruin o'er the tide."
10803,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh, were it mine with sacred Maro's art,                  650"
10804,THE ARGUMENT.,To wake to sympathy the feeling heart;
10805,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like him, the smooth and mournful verse to dress"
10806,THE ARGUMENT.,In all the pomp of exquisite distress;
10807,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, too severely taught by cruel fate,"
10808,THE ARGUMENT.,"To share in all the perils I relate,"
10809,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then might I, with unrivall'd strains, deplore"
10810,THE ARGUMENT.,The impervious horrors of a leeward shore.
10811,THE ARGUMENT.,"As o'er the surf the bending mainmast hung,"
10812,THE ARGUMENT.,Still on the rigging thirty seamen clung:
10813,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some on a broken crag were struggling cast,                 660"
10814,THE ARGUMENT.,And there by oozy tangles grappled fast;
10815,THE ARGUMENT.,"Awhile they bore the o'erwhelming billows' rage,"
10816,THE ARGUMENT.,Unequal combat with their fate to wage
10817,THE ARGUMENT.,Till all benumb'd and feeble they forego
10818,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their slippery hold, and sink to shades below:"
10819,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some, from the main yard-arm impetuous thrown"
10820,THE ARGUMENT.,"On marble ridges, die without a groan:"
10821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three, with Palemon, on their skill depend,"
10822,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the wreck on oars and rafts descend;
10823,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now on the mountain-wave on high they ride,                 670"
10824,THE ARGUMENT.,Then downward plunge beneath the involving tide;
10825,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till one, who seems in agony to strive,"
10826,THE ARGUMENT.,The whirling breakers heave on shore alive:
10827,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest a speedier end of anguish knew,"
10828,THE ARGUMENT.,And press'd the stony beach--a lifeless crew!
10829,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next, O unhappy chief! the eternal doom"
10830,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Heaven decreed thee to the briny tomb:
10831,THE ARGUMENT.,What scenes of misery torment thy view!
10832,THE ARGUMENT.,What painful struggles of thy dying crew!
10833,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy perish'd hopes all buried in the flood                  680
10834,THE ARGUMENT.,"O'erspread with corses, red with human blood!--"

10843,THE ARGUMENT.,For now strong nature's sympathetic chain                   690
10844,THE ARGUMENT.,Tugs at his yearning heart with powerful strain:
10845,THE ARGUMENT.,"His faithful wife, for ever doom'd to mourn"

10864,THE ARGUMENT.,Five only left of all the shipwreck'd throng
10865,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet ride the mast which shoreward drives along;

10878,THE ARGUMENT.,"The demons of destruction hover nigh,"
10879,THE ARGUMENT.,And thick their mortal shafts commission'd fly;

10882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hurl'd on the crags, behold they gasp, they bleed!          730"
10883,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, groaning, cling upon the elusive weed;"
10884,THE ARGUMENT.,Another billow bursts in boundless roar!
10885,THE ARGUMENT.,Arion sinks! and Memory views no more.

10900,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still trembling to descend, they downward gaze"
10901,THE ARGUMENT.,"With horror pale, and torpid with amaze."
10902,THE ARGUMENT.,The floods recoil! the ground appears below!                750
10903,THE ARGUMENT.,And life's faint embers now rekindling glow;
10904,THE ARGUMENT.,"Awhile they wait the exhausted waves' retreat,"
10905,THE ARGUMENT.,Then climb slow up the beach with hands and feet.
10906,THE ARGUMENT.,O Heaven! deliver'd by whose sovereign hand

10920,THE ARGUMENT.,"The surf with mangled bodies strew'd around,"
10921,THE ARGUMENT.,And those yet breathing on the sea-wash'd ground:
10922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though lost to science and the nobler arts,                 770"
10923,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet nature's lore inform'd their feeling hearts;
10924,THE ARGUMENT.,"Straight down the vale with hastening steps they hied,"
10925,THE ARGUMENT.,The unhappy sufferers to assist and guide.
10926,THE ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile those three escaped beneath explore
10927,THE ARGUMENT.,The first adventurous youth who reached the shore.
10928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Panting, with eyes averted from the day,"
10929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prone, helpless, on the tangly beach he lay."
10930,THE ARGUMENT.,"It is Palemon! oh, what tumults roll"

10932,THE ARGUMENT.,"""If yet unhurt he lives again to view                       780"
10933,THE ARGUMENT.,"His friend, and this sole remnant of our crew,"

10935,THE ARGUMENT.,"And share the future good or ill unknown?"""
10936,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arion thus; but ah, sad doom of fate!"
10937,THE ARGUMENT.,That bleeding memory sorrows to relate;
10938,THE ARGUMENT.,"While yet afloat, on some resisting rock"
10939,THE ARGUMENT.,"His ribs were dash'd, and fractured with the shock:"

10942,THE ARGUMENT.,"Distilling blood his lovely breast o'erspread,              790"

10945,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were wounded, or the vocal organs broke."
10946,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down from his neck, with blazing gems array'd,"
10947,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy image, lovely Anna! hung portray'd;"
10948,THE ARGUMENT.,"The unconscious figure, smiling all serene,"
10949,THE ARGUMENT.,Suspended in a golden chain was seen.
10950,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hadst thou, soft maiden! in this hour of woe"

10955,THE ARGUMENT.,For him thine eyes shall never see again.
10956,THE ARGUMENT.,"With dumb amazement pale, Arion gazed,"
10957,THE ARGUMENT.,And cautiously the wounded youth upraised:

11358,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Roll'd the full tide of eloquence along;                   80
11359,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"That power's big torrent braved with manly pride,"
11360,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And all corruption's venal arts defied!

11363,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Watch'd every motion of the faithless foe,"
11364,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Each plot o'erturned, and baffled every blow:"

11368,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Believed all real virtue thine alone.                      90
11369,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Such then he seem'd, and such indeed might be,"
11370,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],If truth with error ever could agree!

11372,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Portray'd the object she design'd to brand.
11373,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Alas! that virtue should so soon decay,"
11374,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And faction's wild applause thy heart betray!

11376,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And human failings, as a friend, laments:"
11377,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"But when those dangerous errors, big with fate,"
11378,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Spread discord and distraction through the state,          100"

11383,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"While yet with generous sentiment it glow'd,"
11384,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],A stranger to corruption's slippery road;
11385,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],There was a time our patriot durst avow
11386,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Those honest maxims he despises now.
11387,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"How did he then his country's wounds bewail,"

11399,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"But what alarming thoughts the heart amaze,"
11400,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],When on this Janus' other face we gaze!
11401,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"For, lo, possess'd of power's imperial reins,"
11402,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Our chief those visionary ills disdains!
11403,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Alas, how soon the steady patriot turns!"
11404,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],In vain this change astonish'd England mourns!
11405,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Her vital blood, that pour'd from every vein,"
11406,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"So late, to fill the accursed Westphalian drain,"
11407,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Then ceased to flow; the vulture now no more
11408,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With unrelenting rage her bowels tore.                     130
11409,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],His magic rod transforms the bird of prey!
11410,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The millstone feels the touch, and melts away!"
11411,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And, strange to tell, still stranger to believe,"
11412,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"What eyes ne'er saw, and heart could ne'er conceive,"
11413,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"At once, transplanted by the sorcerer's wand,"

11433,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Her armies, wasted with incessant toils,"
11434,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Or doom'd to perish in contagious soils,"
11435,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"To guard some needy royal plunderer's throne,"
11436,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And sent to fall in battles not their own.
11437,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The enormous debt at home, though long o'ercharged,"
11438,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With grievous burdens annually enlarged:                   160
11439,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Crush'd with increasing taxes to the ground,"
11440,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"That suck, like vampires, every bleeding wound:"

11442,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Driven by the ruthless landlord to the door.
11443,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],While thus our land her hapless fate bemoans
11444,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"In secret, and with inward sorrow groans;"
11445,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Though deck'd with tinsel trophies of renown,"
11446,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"All gash'd with sores, with anguish bending down;"
11447,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Can yet some impious parricide appear,"
11448,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Who strives to make this anguish more severe?              170
11449,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Can one exist, so much his country's foe,"
11450,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To bid her wounds with fresh effusion flow?
11451,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"There can; to him in vain she lifts her eyes,"
11452,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],His soul relentless hears her piercing sighs!
11453,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Shameless of front, impatient of control,"
11454,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],He spurs her onward to destruction's goal!
11455,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Nor yet content on curst Westphalia's shore
11456,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"With mad profusion to exhaust her store,"
11457,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Still peace his pompous fulminations brand,"
11458,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],As pirates tremble at the sight of land:                   180
11459,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Still to new wars the public eye he turns,"
11460,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Defies all peril, and at reason spurns;"
11461,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Till press'd with danger, by distress assail'd,"
11462,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"That baffled courage, and o'er skill prevail'd;"
11463,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Till foundering in the storm himself had brew'd,"
11464,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],He strives at last its horrors to elude.
11465,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Some wretched shift must still protect his name,"
11466,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And to the guiltless head transfer his shame:
11467,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Then hearing modest diffidence oppose
11468,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"His rash advice, that golden time he chose;                190"
11469,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And while big surges threaten'd to o'erwhelm
11470,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The ship, ingloriously forsook the helm."
11471,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"But all the events collected to relate,"
11472,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Let us his actions recapitulate.
11473,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"He first assumed, by mean perfidious art,"
11474,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Those patriot tenets foreign to his heart:
11475,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Next, by his country's fond applauses swell'd,"
11476,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Thrust himself forward into power, and held"
11477,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The reins on principles which he alone,"
11478,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Grown drunk and wanton with success, could own;            200"
11479,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Betray'd her interest and abused her trust;
11480,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Then, deaf to prayers, forsook her in disgust;"
11481,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"With tragic mummery, and most vile grimace,"
11482,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Rode through the city with a woful face,"
11483,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"As in distress, a patriot out of place!"
11484,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Insults his generous prince, and in the day"
11485,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Of trouble skulks, because he cannot sway!"
11486,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"In foreign climes embroils him with allies,"
11487,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And bids at home the flames of discord rise!
11488,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"She comes! from hell the exulting fury springs,          210"
11489,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With grim destruction sailing on her wings!
11490,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Around her scream a hundred harpies fell!
11491,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],A hundred demons shriek with hideous yell!
11492,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"From where, in mortal venom dipt on high,"
11493,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Full-drawn the deadliest shafts of satire fly;
11494,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Where Churchill brandishes his clumsy club,"
11495,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And Wilkes unloads his excremental tub,"
11496,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Down to where Entick, awkward and unclean,"
11497,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Crawls on his native dust, a worm obscene!"
11498,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],While with unnumber'd wings from van to rear               220
11499,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Myriads of nameless buzzing drones appear:
11500,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"From their dark cells the angry insects swarm,"
11501,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And every little sting attempt to arm.
11502,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Here Chaplains, Privileges, moulder round,"
11503,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And feeble Scourges, [2] rot upon the ground:"
11504,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Here hungry Kenrick strives, with fruitless aim,"
11505,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With Grub-street slander to extend his name:
11506,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"At Bruin flies the slavering, snarling cur,"
11507,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],But only fills his famish'd jaws with fur.
11508,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Here Baldwin spreads the assassinating cloak,              230"
11509,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Where lurking rancour gives the secret stroke;
11510,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"While gorged with filth, around this senseless block,"
11511,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],A swarm of spider-bards obsequious flock:
11512,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"While his demure Welch goat, with lifted hoof,"
11513,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],In Poet's corner hangs each flimsy woof;
11514,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And frisky grown, attempts, with awkward prance,"
11515,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],On wit's gay theatre to bleat and dance.
11516,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Here, seized with iliac passion, mouthing Leech,"
11517,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Too low, alas! for satire's whip to reach,"
11518,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"From his black entrails, faction's common sewer,           240"
11519,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Disgorges all her excremental store.
11520,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With equal pity and regret the Muse
11521,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],The thundering storms that rage around her views;
11522,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Impartial views the tides of discord blend,"
11523,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Where lordly rogues for power and place contend;
11524,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Were not her patriot-heart with anguish torn,"
11525,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Would eye the opposing chiefs with equal scorn.
11526,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Let freedom's deadliest foes for freedom bawl,"
11527,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Alike to her who govern or who fall!
11528,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Aloof she stands, all unconcern'd and mute,                250"
11529,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"While the rude rabble bellow, ""Down with Bute!"""
11530,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"While villany the scourge of justice bilks,"
11531,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Howl on, ye ruffians! ""Liberty and Wilkes."""
11532,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Let some soft mummy of a peer, who stains"
11533,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"His rank, some sodden lump of ass's brains,"
11534,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To that abandon'd wretch his sanction give;
11535,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Support his slander, and his wants relieve!"
11536,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Let the great hydra roar aloud for Pitt,"
11537,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And power and wisdom all to him submit!
11538,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Let proud ambition's sons, with hearts severe,             260"
11539,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Like parricides, their mother's bowels tear!"
11540,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Sedition her triumphant flag display,"
11541,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And in embodied ranks her troops array!
11542,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"While coward justice, trembling on her seat,"
11543,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Like a vile slave descends to lick her feet!
11544,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Nor here let censure draw her awful blade,"
11545,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],If from her theme the wayward Muse has stray'd!
11546,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Sometimes the impetuous torrent, o'er its mounds"
11547,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Redundant bursting, swamps the adjacent grounds;"
11548,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"But rapid, and impatient of delay,                         270"
11549,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Through the deep channel still pursues its way.
11550,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Our pilot now retired, no pleasure knows,"
11551,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],But every man and measure to oppose;
11552,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Like Æsop's cur, still snarling and perverse,"
11553,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Bloated with envy, to mankind a curse,"
11554,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"No more at council his advice will lend,"
11555,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],But with all others who advise contend:
11556,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"He bids distraction o'er his country blaze,"
11557,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Then, swelter'd with revenge, retreats to Hayes:"
11558,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Swallows the pension; but, aware of blame,                 280"
11559,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Transfers the proffer'd peerage to his dame.
11560,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The felon thus of old, his name to save,"
11561,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],His pilfer'd mutton to a brother gave.
11562,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],But should some frantic wretch whom all men know
11563,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"To nature and humanity a foe,"
11564,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Deaf to the widow's moan and orphan's cry,"
11565,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And dead to shame and friendship's social tie;
11566,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Should such a miscreant, at the hour of death,"
11567,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To thee his fortunes and domains bequeath;
11568,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With cruel rancour wresting from his heirs                 290
11569,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],What nature taught them to expect as theirs;
11570,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Wouldst thou with this detested robber join,"
11571,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Their legal wealth to plunder and purloin?
11572,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Forbid it, Heaven! thou canst not be so base,"
11573,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To blast thy name with infamous disgrace!
11574,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The Muse who wakes, yet triumphs o'er thy hate,"
11575,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Dares not so black a thought anticipate:
11576,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"By Heaven, the Muse her ignorance betrays;"
11577,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"For while a thousand eyes with wonder gaze,"
11578,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Though gorged and glutted with his country's store,        300"
11579,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],The vulture pounces on the shining ore;
11580,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"In his strong talons gripes the golden prey,"
11581,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And from the weeping orphan bears away.
11582,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The great, the alarming deed is yet to come,"
11583,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"That, big with fate, strikes expectation dumb."
11584,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Oh, patient, injured England, yet unveil"
11585,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Thy eyes, and listen to the Muse's tale,"
11586,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"That true as honour, unadorn'd with art,"
11587,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Thy wrongs in fair succession shall impart!
11588,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Ere yet the desolating god of war                        310
11589,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Had crush'd pale Europe with his iron car,"
11590,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Had shook her shores with terrible alarms,"
11591,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And thunder'd o'er the trembling deep, ""To arms!"""
11592,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"In climes remote, beyond the setting sun,"
11593,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Beyond the Atlantic wave, his rage begun."
11594,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Alas! poor country, how with pangs unknown"
11595,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To Britain did thy filial bosom groan!
11596,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"What savage armies did thy realms invade,"
11597,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Unarm'd, and distant from maternal aid!"
11598,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Thy cottages with cruel flames consumed,                   320"
11599,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And the sad owner to destruction doom'd;
11600,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Mangled with wounds, with pungent anguish torn,"
11601,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Or left to perish naked and forlorn!
11602,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],What carnage reek'd upon thy ruin'd plain!
11603,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],What infants bled! what virgins shriek'd in vain!
11604,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"In every look distraction seem'd to glare,"
11605,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Each heart was rack'd with horror and despair.
11606,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"To Albion then, with groans and piercing cries,"
11607,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],America lift up her dying eyes;
11608,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"To generous Albion pour'd forth all her pain,              330"
11609,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To whom the wretched never wept in vain.
11610,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"She heard, and instant to relieve her flew,"
11611,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Her arm the gleaming sword of vengeance drew;
11612,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Far o'er the ocean wave her voice was known,"
11613,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],That shook the deep abyss from zone to zone:
11614,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"She bade the thunder of the battle glow,"
11615,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And pour'd the storm of lightning on the foe;
11616,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Nor ceased till, crown'd with victory complete,"
11617,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Pale Spain and France lay trembling at her feet.
11618,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Her fears dispell'd, and all her foes removed,           340"
11619,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Her fertile grounds industriously improved,"
11620,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Her towns with trade, with fleets her harbours crown'd,"
11621,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And plenty smiling on her plains around:
11622,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Thus blest with all that commerce could supply,"
11623,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"America regards with jealous eye,"
11624,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And canker'd heart, the parent, who so late"
11625,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Had snatch'd her gasping from the jaws of fate;
11626,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Who now, with wars for her begun, relax'd,"
11627,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"With grievous aggravated burthens tax'd,"
11628,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Her treasures wasted by a hungry brood                     350
11629,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Of cormorants, that suck her vital blood;"
11630,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Who now of her demands that tribute due,"
11631,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],For whom alone the avenging sword she drew.
11632,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Scarce had America the just request
11633,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Received, when, kindling in her faithless breast,"
11634,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Resentment glows, enraged sedition burns,"
11635,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And, lo! the mandate of our laws she spurns!"
11636,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Her secret hate, incapable of shame"
11637,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Or gratitude, incenses to a flame,"
11638,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Derides our power, bids insurrection rise,                 360"
11639,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Insults our honour, and our laws defies;"
11640,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"O'er all her coasts is heard the audacious roar,"
11641,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"""England shall rule America no more!"""
11642,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Soon as on Britain's shore the alarm was heard,"
11643,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Stern indignation in her look appear'd;
11644,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Yet, both to punish, she her scourge withheld"
11645,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],From her perfidious sons who thus rebell'd;
11646,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Now stung with anguish, now with rage assail'd,"
11647,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Till pity in her soul at last prevail'd,"
11648,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Determined not to draw her penal steel                     370
11649,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Till fair persuasion made her last appeal.
11650,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And now the great decisive hour drew nigh,"
11651,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],She on her darling patriot cast her eye;
11652,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"His voice like thunder will support her cause,"
11653,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Enforce her dictates, and sustain her laws;"
11654,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Rich with her spoils, his sanction will dismay,"
11655,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And bid the insurgents tremble and obey.
11656,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"He comes!--but where, the amazing theme to hit,"
11657,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Discover language or ideas fit?
11658,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Splay-footed words, that hector, bounce, and swagger,      380"
11659,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The sense to puzzle, and the brain to stagger?"
11660,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Our patriot comes! with frenzy fired, the Muse"
11661,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With allegoric eye his figure views!
11662,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Like the grim portress of hell-gate he stands,"
11663,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Bellona's scourge hangs trembling in his hands!
11664,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Around him, fiercer than the ravenous shark,"
11665,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"""A cry of hell-hounds' never-ceasing bark;"""
11666,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And lo! the enormous giant to bedeck,"
11667,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],A golden millstone hangs upon his neck!
11668,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"On him ambition's vulture darts her claws,                 390"
11669,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And with voracious rage his liver gnaws.
11670,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Our patriot comes!--the buckles of whose shoes
11671,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Not Cromwell's self was worthy to unloose.
11672,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Repeat his name in thunder to the skies!
11673,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Ye hills fall prostrate, and ye vales arise!"
11674,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Through faction's wilderness prepare the way!
11675,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Prepare, ye listening senates, to obey!"
11676,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"The idol of the mob, behold him stand,"
11677,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],The Alpha and Omega of the land!
11678,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Methinks I hear the bellowing demagogue                  400
11679,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Dumb-sounding declamations disembogue,"
11680,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Expressions of immeasurable length,"
11681,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Where pompous jargon fills the place of strength;
11682,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Where fulminating, rumbling eloquence,"
11683,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"With loud theatric rage, bombards the sense;"
11684,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And words, deep rank'd in horrible array,"
11685,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Exasperated metaphors convey!
11686,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"With these auxiliaries, drawn up at large,"
11687,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],He bids enraged sedition beat the charge:
11688,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"From England's sanguine hope his aid withdraws,            410"
11689,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And lists to guide in insurrection's cause.
11690,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And lo! where, in her sacrilegious hand,"
11691,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],The parricide lifts high her burning brand!
11692,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Go, while she yet suspends her impious aim,"
11693,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],With those infernal lungs arouse the flame!
11694,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Though England merits not her least regard,"
11695,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Thy friendly voice gold boxes shall reward!
11696,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Arise, embark! prepare thy martial car,"
11697,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],To lead her armies and provoke the war!
11698,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Rebellion wakes, impatient of delay,                       420"
11699,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],The signal her black ensigns to display.
11700,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"To thee, whose soul, all steadfast and serene,"
11701,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Beholds the tumults that distract our scene;
11702,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"And, in the calmer seats of wisdom placed,"
11703,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Enjoys the sweets of sentiment and taste:
11704,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"To thee, O Marius! whom no factions sway,"
11705,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],The impartial Muse devotes her honest lay!
11706,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"In her fond breast no prostituted aim,"
11707,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Nor venal hope, assumes fair friendship's name:"
11708,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Sooner shall Churchill's feeble meteor-ray,                430"
11709,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"That led our foundering demagogue astray,"
11710,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Darkling to grope and flounce in Error's night,"
11711,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Eclipse great Mansfield's strong meridian light,"
11712,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Than shall the change of fortune, time, or place,"
11713,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Thy generous friendship in my heart efface!
11714,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Oh! whether wandering from thy country far,"
11715,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],And plunged amid the murdering scenes of war;
11716,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Or in the blest retreat of virtue laid,"
11717,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],Where contemplation spreads her awful shade;
11718,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"If ever to forget thee I have power,                       440"
11719,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],May Heaven desert me at my latest hour!
11720,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Still satire bids my bosom beat to arms,"

11722,THE DEMAGOGUE. [1],"Like some full river charged with falling showers,"
