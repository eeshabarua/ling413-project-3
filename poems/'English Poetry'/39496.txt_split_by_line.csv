1504,VENICE,"I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;"
1505,VENICE,A palace and a prison on each hand:
1506,VENICE,I saw from out the wave her structures rise
1507,VENICE,As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:
1508,VENICE,A thousand years their cloudy wings expand                         5
1509,VENICE,"Around me, and a dying Glory smiles"
1510,VENICE,"O'er the far times, when many a subject land"
1511,VENICE,"Looked to the wingèd Lion's marble piles,"
1512,VENICE,"Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!"
1513,VENICE,
1514,VENICE,"She looks a sea Cybele, fresh from ocean,                         10"
1515,VENICE,Rising with her tiara of proud towers
1516,VENICE,"At airy distance, with majestic motion,"
1517,VENICE,A ruler of the waters and their powers:
1518,VENICE,And such she was;--her daughters had their dowers
1519,VENICE,"From spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East                  15"
1520,VENICE,Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.
1521,VENICE,"In purple was she robed, and of her feast"
1522,VENICE,"Monarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased."
1523,VENICE,
1524,VENICE,"In Venice Tasso's echoes are no more,"
1525,VENICE,And silent rows the songless gondolier;                           20
1526,VENICE,"Her palaces are crumbling to the shore,"
1527,VENICE,And music meets not always now the ear:
1528,VENICE,Those days are gone--but Beauty still is here.
1529,VENICE,"States fall, arts fade--but Nature doth not die,"
1530,VENICE,"Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,                          25"
1531,VENICE,"The pleasant place of all festivity,"
1532,VENICE,"The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy!"
1533,VENICE,
1534,VENICE,But unto us she hath a spell beyond
1535,VENICE,"Her name in story, and her long array"
1536,VENICE,"Of mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond                        30"
1537,VENICE,Above the dogeless city's vanished sway;
1538,VENICE,Ours is a trophy which will not decay
1539,VENICE,"With the Rialto; Shylock and the Moor,"
1540,VENICE,"And Pierre, cannot be swept or worn away--"
1541,VENICE,"The keystones of the arch! though all were o'er,                  35"
1542,VENICE,For us repeopled were the solitary shore.

1544,VENICE,The spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord;
1545,VENICE,"And, annual marriage now no more renewed,"
1546,VENICE,"The Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,"
1547,VENICE,Neglected garment of her widowhood!                               40
1548,VENICE,St. Mark yet sees his lion where he stood
1549,VENICE,"Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,"
1550,VENICE,"Over the proud Place where an Emperor sued,"
1551,VENICE,And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour
1552,VENICE,When Venice was a queen with an unequalled dower.                   45
1553,VENICE,
1554,VENICE,"Before St. Mark still glow his steeds of brass,"
1555,VENICE,Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;
1556,VENICE,But is not Doria's menace come to pass?
1557,VENICE,"Are they not _bridled_?--Venice, lost and won,"
1558,VENICE,"Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,                       50"
1559,VENICE,"Sinks, like a seaweed, into whence she rose!"
1560,VENICE,"Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,"
1561,VENICE,"Even in destruction's death, her foreign foes,"
1562,VENICE,From whom submission wrings an infamous repose.
