1253,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"A foaming brook, with many a bound,"
1254,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,Followed us like a playful hound;
1255,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Then leaped before us, and in the hollow"
1256,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Paused, and waited for us to follow,"
1257,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And seemed impatient, and afraid"
1258,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,That our tardy flight should be betrayed
1259,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made.
1260,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And when we reached the plain below,"
1261,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,We paused a moment and drew rein
1262,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,To look back at the castle again;
1263,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,And we saw the windows all aglow
1264,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"With lights, that were passing to and fro;"
1265,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;
1266,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,The brook crept silent to our feet;

1268,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,
1269,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,Then suddenly horns began to blow;
1270,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,"
1271,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,And our horses snorted in the damp
1272,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Night-air of the meadows green and wide,"
1273,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And in a moment, side by side,"
1274,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"So close, they must have seemed but one,"
1275,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"The shadows across the moonlight run,"
1276,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And another came, and swept behind,"
1277,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!
1278,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,
1279,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,How I remember that breathless flight

1282,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Backward like a river flowed,"
1283,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Sweeping with it fences and hedges,"
1284,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Whilst farther away, and overhead,"
1285,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Paler than I, with fear and dread,"
1286,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"The moon fled with us, as we fled"
1287,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,Along the forest's jagged edges!
1288,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,
1289,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,All this I can remember well;
1290,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,But of what afterwards befell

1293,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,The rest is a blank and darkness all.
1294,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"When I awoke out of this swoon,"
1295,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"The sun was shining, not the moon,"
1296,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,Making a cross upon the wall
1297,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;
1298,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray,"
1299,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"From early childhood, day by day,"
1300,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Each morning, as in bed I lay!"
1301,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,I was lying again in my own room!
1302,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,"
1303,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,That those shadows on the midnight plain
1304,IRMINGARD'S ESCAPE.,"Were gone, and could not come again!"

2318,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"He saw the flapping crow, whose frequent note"

2323,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,But other game just then was in his eye--
2324,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"A savage camp, whose occupants preferred"

2326,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2327,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"He rang his bell, and at the martial sound"
2328,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Twelve silver spurs their jingling rowels clashed;
2329,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Six horses sprang across the level ground

2333,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"They charged the camp, and in one moment more"

2335,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2336,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"The Friar saw the conflict from a knoll,"

2344,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2345,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,When at that moment--as the story goes--
2346,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"A certain squaw, who had her foes eluded,"
2347,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Ran past the Friar--just before his nose.
2348,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"He stared a moment, and in silence brooded,"
2349,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Then in his breast a pious frenzy rose
2350,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And every other prudent thought excluded;
2351,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"He caught a lasso, and dashed in a canter"
2352,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,After that Occidental Atalanta.
2353,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2354,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"High o'er his head he swirled the dreadful noose,"
2355,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"But, as the practice was quite unfamiliar,"
2356,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,His first cast tore Felipe's captive loose
2357,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"And almost choked Tiburcio Camilla,"
2358,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And might have interfered with that brave youth's
2359,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Ability to gorge the tough _tortilla_;
2360,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"But all things come by practice, and at last"
2361,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,His flying slip-knot caught the maiden fast.
2362,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2363,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Then rose above the plain a mingled yell
2364,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Of rage and triumph--a demoniac whoop;
2365,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"The Padre heard it like a passing knell,"
2366,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And would have loosened his unchristian loop;
2367,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"But the tough raw-hide held the captive well,"
2368,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"And held, alas! too well the captor-dupe;"
2369,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"For with one bound the savage fled amain,"
2370,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Dragging horse, Friar, down the lonely plain."
2371,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2372,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Down the _arroyo_, out across the mead,"
2373,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"By heath and hollow, sped the flying maid,"
2374,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Dragging behind her still the panting steed
2375,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"And helpless Friar, who in vain essayed"
2376,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,To cut the lasso or to check his speed.
2377,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"He felt himself beyond all human aid,"
2378,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"And trusted to the saints--and, for that matter,"

2380,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2381,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Alas! the lasso had been duly blessed,"
2382,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"And, like baptism, held the flying wretch--"
2383,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,A doctrine that the priest had oft expressed--
2384,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Which, like the lasso, might be made to stretch"
2385,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,But would not break; so neither could divest
2386,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Themselves of it, but, like some awful _fetch_,"
2387,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,The holy Friar had to recognize
2388,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,The image of his fate in heathen guise.
2389,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2390,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow;
2391,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill;
2392,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,He saw the gopher standing in his burrow;
2393,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,He saw the squirrel scampering at his will;--
2394,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"He saw all this, and felt no doubt how thorough"
2395,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,The contrast was to his condition; still
2396,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"The squaw kept onward to the sea, till night"
2397,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And the cold sea-fog hid them both from sight.
2398,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2399,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"The morning came above the serried coast,"
2400,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Lighting the snow-peaks with its beacon fires,"
2401,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Driving before it all the fleet-winged host
2402,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Of chattering birds above the Mission spires,"
2403,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Filling the land with light and joy--but most
2404,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,The savage woods with all their leafy lyres;
2405,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,In pearly tints and opal flame and fire
2406,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"The morning came, but not the holy Friar."
2407,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2408,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Weeks passed away. In vain the Fathers sought
2409,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Some trace or token that might tell his story;
2410,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Some thought him dead, or, like Elijah, caught"
2411,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Up to the heavens in a blaze of glory.
2412,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,In this surmise some miracles were wrought
2413,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"On his account, and souls in purgatory"
2414,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Were thought to profit from his intercession;
2415,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"In brief, his absence made a ""deep impression."""
2416,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2417,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,A twelvemonth passed; the welcome Spring once more
2418,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Made green the hills beside the white-faced Mission,"
2419,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Spread her bright dais by the western shore,"
2420,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And sat enthroned--a most resplendent vision.
2421,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,The heathen converts thronged the chapel door
2422,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"At morning mass, when, says the old tradition,"
2423,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"A frightful whoop throughout the church resounded,"
2424,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And to their feet the congregation bounded.
2425,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2426,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"A tramp of hoofs upon the beaten course,"
2427,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Then came a sight that made the bravest quail:
2428,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"A phantom Friar on a spectre horse,"
2429,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Dragged by a creature decked with horns and tail.
2430,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"By the lone Mission, with the whirlwind's force,"
2431,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"They madly swept, and left a sulphurous trail--"
2432,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And that was all--enough to tell the story
2433,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And leave unblessed those souls in purgatory.
2434,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2435,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"And ever after, on that fatal day"
2436,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"That Friar Pedro rode abroad lassoing,"
2437,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,A ghostly couple came and went away
2438,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"With savage whoop and heathenish hallooing,"
2439,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"Which brought discredit on San Luis Rey,"
2440,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And proved the Mission's ruin and undoing;
2441,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"For ere ten years had passed, the squaw and Friar"
2442,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Performed to empty walls and fallen spire.
2443,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,
2444,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,The Mission is no more; upon its walls
2445,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,"The golden lizards slip, or breathless pause"
2446,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Still as the sunshine brokenly that falls
2447,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Through crannied roof and spider-webs of gauze;
2448,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,No more the bell its solemn warning calls--
2449,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,A holier silence thrills and overawes;
2450,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,And the sharp lights and shadows of to-day
2451,FRIAR PEDRO'S RIDE.,Outline the Mission of San Luis Rey.

3088,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"In the full foam of wrath and dread,"
3089,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,To me the desert-born was led;
3090,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"They bound me on, that menial throng,"
3091,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Upon his back with many a thong;
3092,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Then loosed him with a sudden lash,--"
3093,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Away!--away!--and on we dash!
3094,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Torrents less rapid and less rash.
3095,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Away!--away! My breath was gone,--"
3096,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I saw not where he hurried on:
3097,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"'Twas scarcely yet the break of day,"
3098,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And on he foamed,--away!--away!--"
3099,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The last of human sounds which rose,"
3100,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"As I was darted from my foes,"
3101,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Was the wild shout of savage laughter,"
3102,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Which on the wind came roaring after
3103,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,A moment from that rabble rout:
3104,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,"
3105,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And snapped the cord, which to the mane"
3106,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,"
3107,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And writhing half my form about,"
3108,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Howled back my curse; but midst the tread,"
3109,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The thunder of my courser's speed,"
3110,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Perchance they did not hear nor heed:
3111,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"It vexes me,--for I would fain"
3112,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Have paid their insult back again.
3113,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I paid it well in after days:
3114,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"There is not of that castle gate,"
3115,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Its drawbridge and portcullis' weight,"
3116,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Stone, bar, moat, bridge, or barrier left;"
3117,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Nor of its fields a blade of grass,"
3118,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Save what grows on a ridge of wall,"
3119,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Where stood the hearthstone of the hall;
3120,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And many a time ye there might pass,"
3121,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Nor dream that e'er that fortress was:
3122,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I saw its turrets in a blaze,"
3123,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Their crackling battlements all cleft,"
3124,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And the hot lead pour down like rain
3125,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"From off the scorched and blackening roof,"
3126,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Whose thickness was not vengeance-proof.
3127,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"They little thought that day of pain,"
3128,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"When launched, as on the lightning's flash,"
3129,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"They bade me to destruction dash,"
3130,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"That one day I should come again,"
3131,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"With twice five thousand horse, to thank"
3132,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The count for his uncourteous ride.
3133,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"They played me then a bitter prank,"
3134,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"When, with the wild horse for my guide,"
3135,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,They bound me to his foaming flank:
3136,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At length I played them one as frank,--"
3137,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"For time at last sets all things even,--"
3138,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And if we do but watch the hour,"
3139,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,There never yet was human power
3140,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Which could evade, if unforgiven,"
3141,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The patient search and vigil long
3142,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Of him who treasures up a wrong.
3143,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3144,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""Away, away, my steed and I,"
3145,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Upon the pinions of the wind,"
3146,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,All human dwellings left behind;
3147,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"We sped like meteors through the sky,"
3148,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,When with its crackling sound the night
3149,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Is checkered with the northern light:
3150,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Town,--village,--none were on our track,"
3151,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But a wild plain of far extent,"
3152,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And bounded by a forest black:
3153,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And, save the scarce-seen battlement"
3154,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"On distant heights of some strong hold,"
3155,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Against the Tartars built of old,"
3156,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,No trace of man. The year before
3157,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,A Turkish army had marched o'er;
3158,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod,"
3159,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The verdure flies the bloody sod:
3160,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,"
3161,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And a low breeze crept moaning by,--"
3162,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I could have answered with a sigh,--"
3163,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But fast we fled, away, away,--"
3164,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And I could neither sigh nor pray;
3165,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain
3166,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Upon the courser's bristling mane:
3167,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But, snorting still with rage and fear,"
3168,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,He flew upon his far career:
3169,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At times I almost thought, indeed,"
3170,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,He must have slackened in his speed:
3171,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But no,--my bound and slender frame"
3172,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Was nothing to his angry might,"
3173,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And merely like a spur became:
3174,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Each motion which I made to free
3175,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,My swoln limbs from their agony
3176,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Increased his fury and affright:
3177,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I tried my voice,--'twas faint and low,"
3178,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But yet he swerved as from a blow;
3179,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And, starting to each accent, sprang"
3180,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,As from a sudden trumpet's clang:
3181,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Meantime my chords were wet with gore,"
3182,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Which, oozing through my limbs, ran o'er;"
3183,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And in my tongue the thirst became
3184,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,A something fierier far than flame.
3185,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3186,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""We neared the wild wood,--'twas so wide,"
3187,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I saw no bounds on either side;
3188,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,"
3189,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,That bent not to the roughest breeze
3190,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Which howls down from Siberia's waste,"
3191,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And strips the forest in its haste,--"
3192,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But these were few, and far between,"
3193,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Set thick with shrubs more young and green,"
3194,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Luxuriant with their annual leaves,"
3195,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Ere strown by those autumnal eves
3196,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"That nip the forest's foliage dead,"
3197,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Discolored with a lifeless red,"
3198,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Which stands thereon like stiffened gore
3199,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Upon the slain when battle's o'er,"
3200,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And some long winter's night hath shed
3201,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Its frost o'er every tombless head,"
3202,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,So cold and stark the raven's beak
3203,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,May peck unpierced each frozen cheek:
3204,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"'Twas a wild waste of underwood,"
3205,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And here and there a chestnut stood,"
3206,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The strong oak, and the hardy pine;"
3207,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But far apart,--and well it were,"
3208,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Or else a different lot were mine,--"
3209,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The boughs gave way, and did not tear"
3210,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,My limbs; and I found strength to bear
3211,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My wounds, already scarred with cold,--"
3212,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,My bonds forbade to loose my hold.
3213,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"We rustled through the leaves like wind,"
3214,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Left shrubs and trees and wolves behind;
3215,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"By night I heard them on the track,"
3216,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Their troop came hard upon our back,"
3217,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"With their long gallop, which can tire"
3218,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:"
3219,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Where'er we flew they followed on,"
3220,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Nor left us with the morning sun;
3221,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,"
3222,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At daybreak winding through the wood,"
3223,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And through the night had heard their feet
3224,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Their stealing, rustling step repeat."
3225,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"O, how I wished for spear or sword,"
3226,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At least to die amidst the horde,"
3227,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And perish--if it must be so--
3228,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At bay, destroying many a foe."
3229,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"When first my courser's race begun,"
3230,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I wished the goal already won;
3231,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But now I doubted strength and speed.
3232,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed
3233,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Had nerved him like the mountain-roe;
3234,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Nor faster falls the blinding snow
3235,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Which whelms the peasant near the door
3236,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Whose threshold he shall cross no more,"
3237,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Bewildered with the dazzling blast,"
3238,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Than through the forest-paths he past,--"
3239,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Untired, untamed, and worse than wild;"
3240,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,All furious as a favored child
3241,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Balked of its wish; or, fiercer still,"
3242,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"A woman piqued, who has her will."
3243,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3244,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""The wood was past; 'twas more than noon;"
3245,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But chill the air, although in June;"
3246,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Or it might be my veins ran cold,--"
3247,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Prolonged endurance tames the bold:
3248,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And I was then not what I seem,"
3249,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But headlong as a wintry stream,"
3250,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And wore my feelings out before
3251,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I well could count their causes o'er:
3252,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And what with fury, fear, and wrath,"
3253,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The tortures which beset my path,"
3254,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Cold, hunger, sorrow, shame, distress,"
3255,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Thus bound in nature's nakedness;
3256,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Sprung from a race whose rising blood
3257,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"When stirred beyond its calmer mood,"
3258,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And trodden hard upon, is like"
3259,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The rattlesnake's, in act to strike,"
3260,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,What marvel if this worn-out trunk
3261,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Beneath its woes a moment sunk?
3262,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,"
3263,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I seemed to sink upon the ground;
3264,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But erred, for I was fastly bound."
3265,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,"
3266,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:"
3267,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The skies spun like a mighty wheel;
3268,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I saw the trees like drunkards reel,"
3269,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,"
3270,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Which saw no farther: he who dies
3271,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Can die no more than then I died.
3272,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"O'ertortured by that ghastly ride,"
3273,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I felt the blackness come and go,"
3274,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And strove to wake; but could not make
3275,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,My senses climb up from below:
3276,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I felt as on a plank at sea,"
3277,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"When all the waves that dash o'er thee,"
3278,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At the same time upheave and whelm,"
3279,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And hurl thee towards a desert realm.
3280,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,My undulating life was as
3281,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The fancied lights that flitting pass
3282,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Our shut eyes in deep midnight, when"
3283,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Fever begins upon the brain;
3284,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"But soon it passed, with little pain,"
3285,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But a confusion worse than such:
3286,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I own that I should deem it much,"
3287,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Dying, to feel the same again;"
3288,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And yet I do suppose we must
3289,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Feel far more ere we turn to dust:
3290,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,No matter; I have bared my brow
3291,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Full in Death's face--before--and now.
3292,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3293,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""My thoughts came back; where was I? Cold,"
3294,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse"
3295,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Life reassumed its lingering hold,"
3296,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And throb by throb; till grown a pang
3297,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Which for a moment would convulse,"
3298,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;"
3299,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My ear with uncouth noises rang,"
3300,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,My heart began once more to thrill;
3301,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My sight returned, though dim, alas!"
3302,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And thickened, as it were, with glass."
3303,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Methought the dash of waves was nigh;
3304,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"There was a gleam too of the sky,"
3305,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Studded with stars;--it is no dream:
3306,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The wild horse swims the wilder stream!
3307,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The bright broad river's gushing tide
3308,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,"
3309,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And we are half-way struggling o'er
3310,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,To yon unknown and silent shore.
3311,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The waters broke my hollow trance.
3312,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And with a temporary strength
3313,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My stiffened limbs were rebaptized,"
3314,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My courser's broad breast proudly braves,"
3315,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And dashes off the ascending waves,"
3316,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And onward we advance!
3317,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"We reach the slippery shore at length,"
3318,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"A haven I but little prized,"
3319,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"For all behind was dark and drear,"
3320,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And all before was night and fear.
3321,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,How many hours of night or day
3322,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"In those suspended pangs I lay,"
3323,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,I could not tell; I scarcely knew
3324,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,If this were human breath I drew.
3325,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3326,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""With glossy skin, and dripping mane,"
3327,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,"
3328,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
3329,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Up the repelling bank.
3330,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,We gain the top: a boundless plain
3331,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Spreads through the shadow of the night,"
3332,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And onward, onward, onward, seems"
3333,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Like precipices in our dreams,"
3334,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,To stretch beyond the sight;
3335,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And here and there a speck of white,"
3336,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Or scattered spot of dusky green,"
3337,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"In masses broke into the light,"
3338,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,As rose the moon upon my right.
3339,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But naught distinctly seen
3340,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"In the dim waste, would indicate"
3341,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The omen of a cottage gate;
3342,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,No twinkling taper from afar
3343,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Stood like a hospitable star;
3344,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Not even an ignis-fatuus rose
3345,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,To make him merry with my woes:
3346,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,That very cheat had cheered me then!
3347,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Although detected, welcome still,"
3348,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Reminding me, through every ill,"
3349,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Of the abodes of men.
3350,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3351,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""Onward we went,--but slack and slow;"
3352,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"His savage force at length o'erspent,"
3353,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The drooping courser, faint and low,"
3354,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,All feebly foaming went.
3355,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,A sickly infant had had power
3356,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,To guide him forward in that hour;
3357,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But useless all to me.
3358,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"His new-born tameness naught availed,"
3359,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My limbs were bound; my force had failed,"
3360,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Perchance, had they been free."
3361,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,With feeble effort still I tried
3362,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"To rend the bonds so starkly tied,--"
3363,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But still it was in vain;
3364,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"My limbs were only wrung the more,"
3365,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And soon the idle strife gave o'er,"
3366,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Which but prolonged their pain:
3367,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The dizzy race seemed almost done,"
3368,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Although no goal was nearly won:
3369,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Some streaks announced the coming sun.--
3370,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"How slow, alas! he came!"
3371,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Methought that mist of dawning gray
3372,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Would never dapple into day;
3373,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"How heavily it rolled away,--"
3374,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Before the eastern flame
3375,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Rose crimson, and deposed the stars,"
3376,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And called the radiance from their cars,"
3377,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And filled the earth, from his deep throne,"
3378,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"With lonely lustre, all his own."
3379,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,
3380,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"""Up rose the sun; the mists were curled"
3381,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Back from the solitary world
3382,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Which lay around--behind--before:
3383,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,What booted it to traverse o'er
3384,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Plain, forest, river? Man nor brute,"
3385,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,"
3386,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Lay in the wild luxuriant soil;
3387,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"No sign of travel,--none of toil;"
3388,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The very air was mute;
3389,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And not an insect's shrill small horn,"
3390,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Nor matin bird's new voice was borne
3391,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"From herb nor thicket. Many a werst,"
3392,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Panting as if his heart would burst,"
3393,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The weary brute still staggered on;
3394,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,And still we were--or seemed--alone:
3395,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"At length, while reeling on our way,"
3396,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Methought I heard a courser neigh,"
3397,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,From out yon tuft of blackening firs.
3398,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Is it the wind those branches stirs?
3399,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"No, no! from out the forest prance"
3400,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,A trampling troop; I see them come!
3401,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,In one vast squadron they advance!
3402,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"I strove to cry,--my lips were dumb."
3403,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,The steeds rush on in plunging pride;
3404,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,But where are they the reins to guide?
3405,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"A thousand horse,--and none to ride!"
3406,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"With flowing tail, and flying main,"
3407,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Wide nostrils,--never stretched by pain,--"
3408,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,"
3409,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And feet that iron never shod,"
3410,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,"
3411,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"A thousand horse, the wild, the free,"
3412,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Like waves that follow o'er the sea,"
3413,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Came thickly thundering on,"
3414,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,As if our faint approach to meet;
3415,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"The sight renerved my courser's feet,"
3416,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"A moment staggering, feebly fleet,"
3417,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"A moment, with a faint low neigh,"
3418,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"He answered, and then fell;"
3419,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,"
3420,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"And reeking limbs immovable,"
3421,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,His first and last career is done!
3422,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"On came the troop,--they saw him stoop,"
3423,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,They saw me strangely bound along
3424,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,His back with many a bloody thong:
3425,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"They stop--they start--they snuff the air,"
3426,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Gallop a moment here and there,"
3427,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Approach, retire, wheel round and round,"
3428,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Then plunging back with sudden bound,"
3429,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Headed by one black mighty steed,"
3430,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"Who seemed the patriarch of his breed,"
3431,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Without a single speck or hair
3432,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,Of white upon his shaggy hide;
3433,MAZEPPA'S RIDE.,"They snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,"

3838,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,
3839,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Soon in his saddle sate he fast,"
3840,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"And soon the steep descent he past,"
3841,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Soon crossed the sounding barbican,"
3842,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And soon the Teviot side he won.
3843,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Eastward the wooded path he rode,"
3844,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Green hazels o'er his basnet nod;
3845,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"He passed the Peel of Goldiland,"
3846,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And crossed old Borthwick's roaring strand;
3847,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Dimly he viewed the Moat-hill's mound,"
3848,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Where Druid shades still flitted round;
3849,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,In Hawick twinkled many a light;
3850,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Behind him soon they set in night;
3851,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And soon he spurred his courser keen
3852,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Beneath the tower of Hazeldean.
3853,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,
3854,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,The clattering hoofs the watchmen mark;--
3855,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"""Stand, ho! thou courier of the dark.""--"
3856,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"""For Branksome, ho!"" the knight rejoined,"
3857,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And left the friendly tower behind.
3858,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"He turned him now from Teviotside,"
3859,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"And, guided by the tinkling rill,"
3860,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Northward the dark ascent did ride,"
3861,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And gained the moor at Horsliehill;
3862,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Broad on the left before him lay,"
3863,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"For many a mile, the Roman way."
3864,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,
3865,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"A moment now he slacked his speed,"
3866,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,A moment breathed his panting steed;
3867,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Drew saddle-girth and corslet-band.
3868,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And loosened in the sheath his brand.
3869,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"On Minto-crags the moonbeams glint,"
3870,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Where Barnhill hewed his bed of flint;
3871,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Who flung his outlawed limbs to rest,"
3872,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Where falcons hang their giddy nest,"
3873,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Mid cliffs, from whence his eagle eye"
3874,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,For many a league his prey could spy;
3875,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Cliffs, doubling, on their echoes borne,"
3876,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,The terrors of the robber's horn?
3877,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Cliffs, which, for many a later year,"
3878,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"The warbling Doric reed shall hear,"
3879,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"When some sad swain shall teach the grove,"
3880,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Ambition is no cure for love!
3881,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,
3882,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Unchallenged, thence passed Deloraine,"
3883,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,To ancient Riddel's fair domain.
3884,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Where Aill, from mountains freed."
3885,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Down from the lakes did raving come;
3886,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Each wave was crested with tawny foam,"
3887,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Like the mane of a chestnut steed.
3888,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"In vain! no torrent, deep or broad,"
3889,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Might bar the bold moss-trooper's road.
3890,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"At the first plunge the horse sunk low,"
3891,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And the water broke o'er the saddlebow;
3892,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Above the foaming tide, I ween,"
3893,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Scarce half the charger's neck was seen;
3894,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"For he was barded from counter to tail,"
3895,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And the rider was armed complete in mail;
3896,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Never heavier man and horse
3897,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Stemmed a midnight torrent's force.
3898,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"The warrior's very plume, I say"
3899,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Was daggled by the dashing spray:
3900,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Yet, through good heart, and Our Ladye's grace,"
3901,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,At length he gained the landing place.
3902,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,
3903,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Now Bowden Moor the march-man won,"
3904,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"And sternly shook his plumed head,"
3905,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,As glanced his eye o'er Halidon;
3906,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,For on his soul the slaughter red
3907,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Of that unhallowed morn arose,"
3908,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,When first the Scott and Carr were foes;
3909,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"When royal James beheld the fray,"
3910,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Prize to the victor of the day;
3911,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"When Home and Douglas, in the van,"
3912,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Bore down Buccleuch's retiring clan,"
3913,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Till gallant Cessford's heart-blood dear
3914,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Reeked on dark Elliot's Border spear.
3915,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,
3916,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"In bitter mood he spurred fast,"
3917,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And soon the hated heath was past;
3918,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"And far beneath, in lustre wan,"
3919,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Old Melros' rose, and fair Tweed ran:"
3920,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Like some tall rock with lichens gray,"
3921,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Seemed dimly huge, the dark Abbaye."
3922,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"When Hawick he passed, had curfew rung,"
3923,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Now midnight lauds were in Melrose sung.
3924,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"The sound, upon the fitful gale,"
3925,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"In solemn wise did rise and fail,"
3926,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"Like that wild harp, whose magic tone"
3927,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,Is wakened by the winds alone.
3928,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"But when Melrose he reached, 'twas silence all;"
3929,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,"He meetly stabled his steed in stall,"
3930,DELORAINE'S RIDE.,And sought the convent's lonely wall.

3941,GODIVA.,"I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge,"
3942,GODIVA.,To watch the three tall spires; and there I shaped
3943,GODIVA.,The city's ancient legend into this_:--
3944,GODIVA.,"Not only we, the latest seed of Time,"
3945,GODIVA.,"New men, that in the flying of a wheel"
3946,GODIVA.,"Cry down the past, not only we, that prate"
3947,GODIVA.,"Of rights and wrongs, have loved the people well,"
3948,GODIVA.,And loathed to see them overtaxed; but she
3949,GODIVA.,"Did more, and underwent, and overcame,"
3950,GODIVA.,"The woman of a thousand summers back,"
3951,GODIVA.,"Godiva, wife to that grim Earl, who ruled"
3952,GODIVA.,In Coventry: for when he laid a tax
3953,GODIVA.,"Upon his town, and all the mothers brought"
3954,GODIVA.,"Their children, clamoring, ""If we pay, we starve!"""
3955,GODIVA.,"She sought her lord, and found him, where he strode"
3956,GODIVA.,"About the hall, among his dogs, alone,"
3957,GODIVA.,"His beard a foot before him, and his hair"
3958,GODIVA.,"A yard behind. She told him of their tears,"
3959,GODIVA.,"And prayed him, ""If they pay this tax, they starve."""
3960,GODIVA.,"Whereat he stared, replying, half-amazed,"
3961,GODIVA.,"""You would not let your little finger ache"
3962,GODIVA.,"For such as _these_?""--""But I would die,"" said she."
3963,GODIVA.,"He laughed, and swore by Peter and by Paul:"
3964,GODIVA.,Then filliped at the diamond in her ear;
3965,GODIVA.,"""O ay, ay, ay, you talk!""--""Alas!"" she said,"
3966,GODIVA.,"""But prove me what it is I would not do."""
3967,GODIVA.,"And from a heart as rough as Esau's hand,"
3968,GODIVA.,"He answered, ""Ride you naked through the town,"
3969,GODIVA.,"And I repeal it;"" and nodding, as in scorn,"
3970,GODIVA.,"He parted, with great strides among his dogs."
3971,GODIVA.,"So left alone, the passions of her mind,"
3972,GODIVA.,"As winds from all the compass shift and blow,"
3973,GODIVA.,"Made war upon each other for an hour,"
3974,GODIVA.,"Till pity won. She sent a herald forth,"
3975,GODIVA.,"And bade him cry, with sound of trumpet, all"
3976,GODIVA.,The hard condition; but that she would loose
3977,GODIVA.,"The people: therefore, as they loved her well,"
3978,GODIVA.,"From then till noon no foot should pace the street,"
3979,GODIVA.,"No eye look down, she passing; but that all"
3980,GODIVA.,"Should keep within, door shut, and window barred."
3981,GODIVA.,"Then fled she to her inmost bower, and there"
3982,GODIVA.,"Unclasped the wedded eagles of her belt,"
3983,GODIVA.,The grim Earl's gift; but ever at a breath
3984,GODIVA.,"She lingered, looking like a summer moon"
3985,GODIVA.,"Half-dipt in cloud: anon she shook her head,"
3986,GODIVA.,And showered the rippled ringlets to her knee;
3987,GODIVA.,Unclad herself in haste; adown the stair
3988,GODIVA.,"Stole on; and, like a creeping sunbeam, slid"
3989,GODIVA.,"From pillar unto pillar, until she reached"
3990,GODIVA.,The gateway; there she found her palfrey trapt
3991,GODIVA.,In purple blazoned with armorial gold.
3992,GODIVA.,"Then she rode forth, clothed on with chastity:"
3993,GODIVA.,"The deep air listened round her as she rode,"
3994,GODIVA.,And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.
3995,GODIVA.,The little wide-mouthed heads upon the spout
3996,GODIVA.,Had cunning eyes to see: the barking cur
3997,GODIVA.,Made her cheek flame: her palfrey's footfall shot
3998,GODIVA.,Light horrors through her pulses: the blind walls
3999,GODIVA.,Were full of chinks and holes; and overhead
4000,GODIVA.,"Fantastic gables, crowding, stared: but she"
4001,GODIVA.,"Not less through all bore up, till, last, she saw"
4002,GODIVA.,The white-flowered elder-thicket from the field
4003,GODIVA.,Gleam through the Gothic archways in the wall.
4004,GODIVA.,"Then she rode back, clothed on with chastity:"
4005,GODIVA.,"And one low churl, compact of thankless earth,"
4006,GODIVA.,"The fatal byword of all years to come,"
4007,GODIVA.,"Boring a little auger-hole in fear,"
4008,GODIVA.,"Peeped--but his eyes, before they had their will,"
4009,GODIVA.,"Were shrivelled into darkness in his head,"
4010,GODIVA.,"And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait"
4011,GODIVA.,"On noble deeds, cancelled a sense misused;"
4012,GODIVA.,"And she, that knew not, passed: and all at once,"
4013,GODIVA.,"With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon"
4014,GODIVA.,"Was clashed and hammered from a hundred towers,"
4015,GODIVA.,One after one: but even then she gained
4016,GODIVA.,"Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crowned,"
4017,GODIVA.,"To meet her lord, she took the tax away,"
4018,GODIVA.,And built herself an everlasting name.

4123,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4124,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Then he said, ""Good night!"" and with muffled oar"
4125,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,"
4126,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Just as the moon rose over the bay,"
4127,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Where swinging wide at her moorings lay

4134,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,"

4148,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,"

4164,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
4165,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"On a shadowy something far away,"
4166,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Where the river widens to meet the bay,--"
4167,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,A line of black that bends and floats
4168,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats."
4169,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4170,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,"
4171,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Booted and spurred with a heavy stride
4172,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
4173,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Now he patted his horse's side,"
4174,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Now gazed at the landscape far and near,"
4175,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,"
4176,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
4177,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,But mostly he watched with eager search
4178,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,"
4179,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"As it rose above the graves on the hill,"
4180,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
4181,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height"
4182,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!"
4183,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,"
4184,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight"
4185,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,A second lamp in the belfry burns!
4186,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4187,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"A hurry of hoofs in a village street,"
4188,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,"
4189,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark"
4190,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
4191,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"That was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light,"
4192,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,The fate of a nation was riding that night;
4193,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,"
4194,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
4195,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"He has left the village and mounted the steep,"
4196,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,"
4197,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;"
4198,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And under the alders, that skirt its edge,"
4199,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,"
4200,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.
4201,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4202,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,It was twelve by the village clock
4203,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
4204,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"He heard the crowing of the cock,"
4205,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And the barking of the farmer's dog,"
4206,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And felt the damp of the river fog,"
4207,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,That rises after the sun goes down.
4208,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4209,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"It was one by the village clock,"
4210,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,When he galloped into Lexington.
4211,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,He saw the gilded weathercock
4212,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Swim in the moonlight as he passed,"
4213,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,"
4214,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Gaze at him with a spectral glare,"
4215,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,As if they already stood aghast
4216,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,At the bloody work they would look upon.
4217,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4218,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"It was two by the village clock,"
4219,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
4220,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"He heard the bleating of the flock,"
4221,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"And the twitter of birds among the trees,"
4222,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,And felt the breath of the morning breeze
4223,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Blowing over the meadows brown.
4224,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,And one was safe and asleep in his bed
4225,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Who at the bridge would be first to fall,"
4226,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Who that day would be lying dead,"
4227,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Pierced by a British musket-ball.
4228,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4229,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"You know the rest. In the books you have read,"
4230,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"How the British Regulars fired and fled,--"
4231,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"How the farmers gave them ball for ball,"
4232,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,"
4233,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Chasing the red-coats down the lane,"
4234,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,Then crossing the fields to emerge again
4235,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"Under the trees at the turn of the road,"
4236,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,And only pausing to fire and load.
4237,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
4238,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,So through the night rode Paul Revere;
4239,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,And so through the night went his cry of alarm
4240,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"To every Middlesex village and farm,--"
4241,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"A cry of defiance and not of fear,"
4242,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"A voice in the darkness a knock at the door,"
4243,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,And a word that shall echo forevermore!
4244,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,"

4246,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"In the hour of darkness and peril and need,"
4247,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,The people will waken and listen to hear

4476,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4477,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4478,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The tall green tree its shadow cast
4479,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Upon Howe's army that southward passed
4480,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"From Gordon's Ford to the Quaker town,"
4481,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Intending in quarters to settle down
4482,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Till snows were gone, and spring again"
4483,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Should easier make a new campaign.
4484,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4485,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Beyond the fences that lined the way,"
4486,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The fields of Captain Richardson lay;
4487,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"His woodland and meadows reached far and wide,"
4488,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"From the hills behind to the Schuylkill's side,"
4489,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Across the stream, in the mountain gorge,"
4490,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,He could see the smoke of the valley forge.
4491,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4492,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The Captain had fought in the frontier war;
4493,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"When the fight was done, bearing seam and scar,"
4494,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,He marched back home to tread once more
4495,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The same tame round he had trod before,"
4496,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And turn his thoughts with sighs of regret
4497,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"To his ploughshares, wishing them sword-blades yet."
4498,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4499,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"He put the meadow in corn that year,"
4500,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And swore till his blacks were white with fear.
4501,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"He plowed, and planted, and married a wife,"
4502,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,But life grew weary with inward strife.
4503,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,His blood was hot and his throbbing brain
4504,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Beat with the surf of some far main.
4505,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4506,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Should he sack a town, or rob the mail,"
4507,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Or on the wide seas a pirate sail?
4508,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"He pondered it over, concluding instead,"
4509,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"To buy three steeds in Arabia bred,"
4510,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"On Sopus, Fearnaught, or Scipio,"
4511,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,He felt his blood more evenly flow.
4512,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4513,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"To his daughter Tacey, the coming days"
4514,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Brought health, and beauty, and graceful ways."
4515,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,He taught her to ride his fleetest steed
4516,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"At a five-barred fence, or a ditch at need,"
4517,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"And the Captain's horses, his hounds, and his child"
4518,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Were famous from sea to forests wild.

4520,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,*....*....*....*
4521,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4522,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Master and man from home were gone,"
4523,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"And Fearnaught held the stables alone,"
4524,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And Mistress Tacey her spirit showed
4525,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The morning the British came down the road.
4526,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"She hid the silver, and drove the cows"
4527,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,To the island behind the willow boughs.
4528,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4529,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Was time too short? or did she forget
4530,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,That Fearnaught stood in the stables yet?
4531,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Across the fields to the gate she ran,"
4532,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And followed the path 'neath the grape-arbors' span;
4533,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,On the doorstep she paused and turned to see
4534,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The head of the line beneath the green tree.
4535,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4536,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The last straggler passed, the night came on,"
4537,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And then 'twas discovered that Fearnaught was gone;
4538,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Sometime, somehow, from his stall he was led,"
4539,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Where an old gray horse was left in his stead,"
4540,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And Tacey must prove to her father that she
4541,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Had been prepared for the emergency.
4542,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4543,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"For the words he scattered on kind soil fell,"
4544,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And Tacey had learned his maxim well
4545,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,In the stories he read. She remembered the art
4546,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,That concealed the fear in Esther's heart;
4547,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,How the words of the woman Abigail
4548,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Appeased the king's wrath, the deed of Jael!"
4549,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4550,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,How Judith went from the city's gate
4551,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Across the plain as the day grew late,"
4552,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,To the tent of the great Assyrian;
4553,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The leader exalted with horse and man,"
4554,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"And brought back his head, said Tacey: ""Of course,"
4555,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"A more difficult feat than to bring back a horse."""
4556,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4557,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,In the English camp the reveille drum
4558,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Told the sleeping troops that the dawn had come,"

4560,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"At the drum's tap startled, crept under each tent"
4561,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,As Tacey stole from the sheltering wood
4562,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Across the wet grass where the horse pound stood.
4563,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4564,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Hark! was it the twitter of frightened bird,"
4565,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Or was it the challenge of sentry she heard?
4566,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"She entered unseen, but her footsteps she stayed"
4567,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"When the old gray horse in the wood still, neighed,"
4568,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Half hid in the mist a shape loomed tall,"
4569,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,A steed that answered her well-known call.
4570,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4571,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,With freedom beyond for the recompense
4572,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"She sprang to his back, and leaped the fence;"
4573,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Too late the alarm; but Tacey heard
4574,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"As she sped away how the camp was stirred,"
4575,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The stamping of horses, the shouts of men"
4576,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And the bugle's impatient call again.
4577,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4578,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Loudly and fast on the Ridge Road beat
4579,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The regular fall of Fearnaught's feet,"
4580,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"On his broad, bare back his rider's seat"
4581,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Was as firm as the tread of the steed so fleet;
4582,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Small need of saddle, or bridle rein,"
4583,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,He answered as well her touch on his mane.
4584,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4585,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"On down the hill by the river shore,"
4586,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Faster and faster she rode than before;
4587,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Her bonnet fell back, her head was bare,"
4588,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And the river breeze that freed her hair
4589,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Dispersed the fog, and she heard the shout"
4590,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Of the troopers behind when the sun came out.
4591,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4592,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The wheel at Van Deering's had dripped nearly dry,"
4593,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,In Sabbath-like stillness the morning passed by;
4594,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Then the clatter of hoofs came down the hill,"
4595,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And the white old miller ran out from the mill.
4596,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,But he only saw through the dust of the road
4597,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The last red-coat that faintly showed.
4598,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4599,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"To Tacey the sky, and the trees, and the wind"
4600,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Seemed all to rush toward her, and follow behind,"
4601,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Her lips were set firm, and pale was her cheek"
4602,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"As she plunged down the hill and through the creek,"
4603,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The tortoise shell comb that she lost that day
4604,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The Wissahickon carried away.
4605,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4606,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,On the other side up the stony hill
4607,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The feet of Fearnaught went faster still,"
4608,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"But somewhat backward the troopers fell,"
4609,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"For the hill, and the pace, began to tell"
4610,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,On their horses worn with a long campaign
4611,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"O'er rugged mountains, and weary plain."
4612,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4613,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The road was deserted, for when men fought"
4614,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,A secret path the traveler sought;
4615,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Two scared idlers in Levering's Inn
4616,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Fled to the woods at the coming din,"
4617,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"The watch dog ran to bark his delight,"
4618,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,But pursued and pursuers were out of sight.
4619,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4620,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Surely the distance between them increased,"
4621,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"And the shouts of the troopers had long since ceased,"
4622,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,One after another pulled his rein
4623,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And rode with great oaths to the camp again.
4624,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Oft a look backward Tacey sent
4625,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,To the fading red of the regiment.
4626,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4627,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,She heard the foremost horseman call;
4628,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"She saw the horse stumble, the rider fall;"
4629,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,She patted her steed and checked his pace
4630,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And leisurely rode the rest of the race.
4631,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,When the Seven-Stars' sign on the horizon showed
4632,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Behind not a trooper was on the road.
4633,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4634,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"In vain had they shouted who followed in chase,"
4635,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,In vain their wild ride; so ended the race.
4636,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Though fifty strong voices may clamor and call,"
4637,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"If she hear not the strongest, she hears not them all;"
4638,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"Though fifty fleet horses go galloping fast,"
4639,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,One swifter than all shall be furthest at last.
4640,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4641,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Said the well-pleased Captain when he came home:
4642,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"""The steed shall be thine and a new silver comb."
4643,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"'Twas a daring deed and bravely done."""
4644,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,"As proud of the praise as the promise won,"
4645,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The maiden stole from the house to feed
4646,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,With a generous hand her gallant steed.
4647,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,
4648,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,Unavailing the storms of the century beat

4651,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,The wind in the trees on the island's shore;

4655,A TALE OF PROVIDENCE.,And years that are gone in obscurity

4736,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,I stood in my stirrup and looked to my right--
4737,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,But Revels was gone; I glanced by my shoulder
4738,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,And saw his horse stagger; I saw his head drooping
4739,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Hard down on his breast, and his naked breast stooping"
4740,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Low down to the mane, as so swifter and bolder"
4741,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,Ran reaching out for us the red-footed fire.
4742,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"To right and to left the black buffalo came,"
4743,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,A terrible surf on a red sea of flame
4744,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Rushing on in the rear, reaching high, reaching higher."
4745,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And he rode neck to neck to a buffalo bull,"
4746,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"The monarch of millions, with shaggy mane full"
4747,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Of smoke and of dust, and it shook with desire"
4748,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Of battle, with rage and with bellowings loud"
4749,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And unearthly, and up through its lowering cloud"
4750,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Came the flash of his eyes like a half-hidden fire,"
4751,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"While his keen crooked horns, through the storm of his mane,"
4752,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,Like black lances lifted and lifted again;
4753,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And I looked but this once, for the fire licked through,"
4754,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And he fell and was lost, as we rode two and two."
4755,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,
4756,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"I looked to my left then,--and nose, neck, and shoulder"
4757,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Sank slowly, sank surely, till back to my thighs;"
4758,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,And up through the black blowing veil of her hair
4759,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Did beam full in mine her two marvelous eyes,"
4760,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"With a longing and love, yet a look of despair"
4761,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And of pity for me, as she felt the smoke fold her,"
4762,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,And flames reaching far for her glorious hair.
4763,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Her sinking steed faltered, his eager ears fell"
4764,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"To and fro and unsteady, and all the neck's swell"
4765,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Did subside and recede, and the nerves fall as dead."
4766,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Then she saw sturdy Paché still lorded his head,"
4767,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"With a look of delight; for nor courage nor bribe,"
4768,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Nor naught but my bride, could have brought him to me."
4769,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"For he was her father's, and at South Santafee"
4770,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Had once won a whole herd, sweeping everything down"
4771,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,In a race where the world came to run for the crown.
4772,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And so when I won the true heart of my bride,--"
4773,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"My neighbor's and deadliest enemy's child,"
4774,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And child of the kingly war-chief of his tribe,--"
4775,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,She brought me this steed to the border the night
4776,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,She met Revels and me in her perilous flight
4777,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,From the lodge of the chief to the North Brazos side;
4778,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And said, so half guessing of ill as she smiled,"
4779,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"As if jesting, that I, and I only, should ride"
4780,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"The fleet-footed Paché, so if kin should pursue"
4781,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,I should surely escape without other ado
4782,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Than to ride, without blood, to the North Brazos side,"
4783,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And await her,--and wait till the next hollow moon"
4784,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Hung her horn in the palms, when surely and soon"
4785,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And swift she would join me, and all would be well"
4786,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,Without bloodshed or word. And now as she fell
4787,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"From the front, and went down in the ocean of fire,"
4788,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,The last that I saw was a look of delight
4789,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,That I should escape--a love--a desire--
4790,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Yet never a word, not one look of appeal,"
4791,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Lest I should reach hand, should stay hand or stay heel"
4792,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,One instant for her in my terrible flight.
4793,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,
4794,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Then the rushing of fire around me and under,"
4795,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And the howling of beasts and a sound as of thunder,--"
4796,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Beasts burning and blind and forced onward and over,"
4797,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"As the passionate flame reached around them, and wove her"
4798,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Red hands in their hair, and kissed hot till they died,--"
4799,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"Till they died with a wild and a desolate moan,"
4800,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,As a sea heart-broken on the hard brown stone ...
4801,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"And into the Brazos ... I rode all alone,--"
4802,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"All alone, save only a horse long-limbed,"
4803,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,And blind and bare and burnt to the skin.
4804,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,Then just as the terrible sea came in
4805,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,And tumbled its thousands hot into the tide
4806,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,Till the tide blocked up and the swift stream brimmed
4807,KIT CARSON'S RIDE.,"In eddies, we struck on the opposite side."

4820,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Behind, on heavy sands, with weary limbs"
4821,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"That cannot reach him. From the highest hill,"
4822,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"He gazes o'er the wild whose plains he spurned,"
4823,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"And his eye kindles, and his breast expands,"
4824,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,With an upheaving consciousness of might.
4825,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"He stands an instant, then he breaks away,"
4826,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"As revelling in his freedom. What if art,"
4827,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"That strikes soul into marble, could but seize"
4828,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"That agony of action,--could impress"
4829,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Its muscular fulness, with its winged haste,"

4842,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Until he stands, an idol of the sight."
4843,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,
4844,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,He stands and trembles! The warm life is gone
4845,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,That gave him action. Wherefore is it thus?
4846,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"His eye hath lost its lustre, though it still"
4847,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Sends forth a glance of consciousness and care,"
4848,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"To a deep agony of acuteness wrought,"
4849,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,And straining at a point--a narrow point--
4850,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"That rises, but a speck upon the verge"
4851,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Of the horizon. Sure, the humblest life,"
4852,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Hath, in God's providence, some gracious guides,"
4853,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"That warn it of its foe. The danger there,"
4854,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"His instinct teaches, and with growing dread,"
4855,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"No more solicitous of graceful flight,"
4856,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"He bounds across the plain--he speeds away,"
4857,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Into the tameless wilderness afar,"
4858,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"To 'scape his bondage. Yet, in vain his flight--"
4859,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Vain his fleet limbs, his desperate aim, his leap"
4860,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Through the close thicket, through the festering swamp,"
4861,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,And rushing waters. His proud neck must bend
4862,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Beneath a halter, and the iron parts"
4863,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"And tears his delicate mouth. The brave steed,"
4864,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Late bounding in his freedom's consciousness,"
4865,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"The leader of the wild, unreached of all,"

4875,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Who subtle, with less strength, had taken him thus,"

4877,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"A sudden pang--a newer form of pain,"

4879,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"And with a shriek of agony, which tells,"
4880,TAMING THE WILD HORSE.,"Loudly, the terrors of his new estate,"

4915,CHIQUITA.,"Struck for that ford in the night, in the rain, and the water all round us;"

4917,CHIQUITA.,"Up to our flanks in the gulch, and Rattlesnake Creek just a bilin',"

4921,CHIQUITA.,
4922,CHIQUITA.,"Lickity, lickity, switch, we came to the ford, and Chiquita"
4923,CHIQUITA.,"Buckled right down to her work, and afore I could yell to her rider,"

4951,BAY BILLY.,
4952,BAY BILLY.,"All day the weaker wing we held,"

4954,BAY BILLY.,Five several stubborn times we charged

4957,BAY BILLY.,And kept our column still.
4958,BAY BILLY.,

4960,BAY BILLY.,Spurred up a General's Aid.
4961,BAY BILLY.,"""That battery must silenced be!"""
4962,BAY BILLY.,"He cried, as past he sped."
4963,BAY BILLY.,"Our Colonel simply touched his cap,"

4965,BAY BILLY.,
4966,BAY BILLY.,To lead the crouching line once more
4967,BAY BILLY.,The grand old fellow came.
4968,BAY BILLY.,No wounded man but raised his head
4969,BAY BILLY.,"And strove to gasp his name,"
4970,BAY BILLY.,"And those who could not speak nor stir,"
4971,BAY BILLY.,"""God blessed him"" just the same."

4973,BAY BILLY.,"For he was all the world to us,"

4987,BAY BILLY.,"Our hearts went with him. Back we swept,"

4990,BAY BILLY.,But hung his dogged head.

4995,BAY BILLY.,"The Colonel's horse we spied,"

4997,BAY BILLY.,"His nostrils swelling wide,"
4998,BAY BILLY.,As though still on his gallant back
4999,BAY BILLY.,The master sat astride.
5000,BAY BILLY.,
5001,BAY BILLY.,Right royally he took the place
5002,BAY BILLY.,"That was of old his wont,"
5003,BAY BILLY.,"And with a neigh that seemed to say,"
5004,BAY BILLY.,"Above the battle's brunt,"
5005,BAY BILLY.,"""How can the Twenty-second charge"
5006,BAY BILLY.,"If I am not in front?"""
5007,BAY BILLY.,
5008,BAY BILLY.,"Like statues rooted there we stood,"
5009,BAY BILLY.,"And gazed a little space,"
5010,BAY BILLY.,Above that floating mane we missed
5011,BAY BILLY.,"The dear familiar face,"
5012,BAY BILLY.,"But we saw Bay Billy's eye of fire,"
5013,BAY BILLY.,And it gave us heart of grace.
5014,BAY BILLY.,
5015,BAY BILLY.,No bugle-call could rouse us all
5016,BAY BILLY.,As that brave sight had done.
5017,BAY BILLY.,Down all the battered line we felt

5019,BAY BILLY.,"Up! up! the hill we followed Bill,"

5024,BAY BILLY.,Vainly mid living and the dead

5026,BAY BILLY.,It seemed as if a spectre steed
5027,BAY BILLY.,To win that day had come.
5028,BAY BILLY.,
5029,BAY BILLY.,And then the dusk and dew of night
5030,BAY BILLY.,"Fell softly o'er the plain,"
5031,BAY BILLY.,As though o'er man's dread work of death
5032,BAY BILLY.,"The angels wept again,"
5033,BAY BILLY.,And drew night's curtain gently round

5047,BAY BILLY.,Though naught but that last trump of all
5048,BAY BILLY.,Could ope their heavy eyes.
5049,BAY BILLY.,
5050,BAY BILLY.,"And then once more with banners gay,"
5051,BAY BILLY.,Stretched out the long Brigade.
5052,BAY BILLY.,Trimly upon the furrowed field
5053,BAY BILLY.,"The troops stood on parade,"

5056,BAY BILLY.,

5064,BAY BILLY.,Ah! who forgets that dreary hour
5065,BAY BILLY.,"When, as with misty eyes,"
5066,BAY BILLY.,To call the old familiar roll
5067,BAY BILLY.,"The solemn Sergeant tries,--"
5068,BAY BILLY.,One feels that thumping of the heart
5069,BAY BILLY.,As no prompt voice replies.
5070,BAY BILLY.,
5071,BAY BILLY.,And as in faltering tone and slow
5072,BAY BILLY.,"The last few names were said,"
5073,BAY BILLY.,Across the field some missing horse
5074,BAY BILLY.,"Toiled up with weary tread,"
5075,BAY BILLY.,"It caught the Sergeant's eye, and quick"

5128,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"In place of riding tilt 'gainst such a sun,"
5129,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Here in the safe veranda's flowery gloom,"

5142,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"So, in late autumn,--'twas a marvellous morn,"
5143,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,With breezes from the calm snow-river borne
5144,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"That touched the air, and stirred it into thrills,"
5145,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Mysterious and mesmeric, a bright mist"
5146,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Lapping the landscape like a golden trance,"
5147,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Swathing the hill-tops with fantastic veils,"
5148,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,And o'er the moorland-ocean quivering light
5149,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,As gossamer threads drawn down the forest aisles
5150,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"At dewy dawning,--on this marvellous morn,"
5151,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"I, with four comrades, in this selfsame spot,"
5152,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Watched the fair scene, and drank the spicy airs,"
5153,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"That held a subtler spirit than our wine,"
5154,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"And talked and laughed, and mused in idleness,--"
5155,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Weaving vague fancies, as our pipe-wreaths curled"
5156,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Fantastic in the sunlight! I, with head"
5157,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Thrown back, and cushioned snugly, and with eyes"
5158,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Intent on one grotesque and curious cloud,"
5159,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Puffed upward, that now seemed to take the shape"
5160,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Of a Dutch tulip, now a Turk's face topped"
5161,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"By folds on folds of turban limitless,--"
5162,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Heard suddenly, just as the clock chimed one,"

5167,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Two stalwart herdsmen on our threshold paused,"

5177,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"No more: with booming thunder in mine ears,"
5178,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"And blood-flushed eyes, I rushed to Widderin's side,"
5179,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Drew tight the girths, upgathered curb and rein,"
5180,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,And sprang to horse ere yet our laggard friends--
5181,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,Now trooping from the green veranda's shade--
5182,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,Could dream of action!
5183,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,
5184,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Love had winged my will,"
5185,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,For to the southward fair Garoopna held
5186,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"My all of hope, life, passion; she whose hair"
5187,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"(Its tiniest strand of waving, witch-like gold)"
5188,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Had caught my heart, entwined, and bound it fast,"
5189,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,As 'twere some sweet enchantment's heavenly net!
5190,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,
5191,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"I only gave a hand-wave in farewell,"

5197,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"The beacon pine gigantic, whose grim crown"
5198,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,Signals the far land-mariner from out
5199,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Gaunt boulders of the gray-backed Organ hill,"
5200,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Rose on my sight, a mist-like, wavering orb,"
5201,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"The while, still onward, onward, onward still,"
5202,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"With motion winged, elastic, equable,"
5203,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Brave Widderin cleaved the air-tides, tossed aside"
5204,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"The winds as waves, their swift, invisible breasts"
5205,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,Hissing with foam-like noise when pressed and pierced
5206,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,By that keen head and fiery-crested form!
5207,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,
5208,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"The lonely shepherd guardian on the plains,"
5209,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Watching his sheep through languid, half-shut eyes,"
5210,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Looked up, and marvelled, as we passed him by,"
5211,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Thinking, perchance, it was a glorious thing,"

5213,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,To ride such bright blood-coursers unto death!
5214,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Two sun-blacked natives, slumbering in the grass,"
5215,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Just rose betimes to 'scape the trampling hoofs,"
5216,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,And hurled hot curses at me as I sped;
5217,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,While here and there the timid kangaroo
5218,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Blundered athwart the mole-hills, and in puffs"
5219,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,Of steamy dust-cloud vanished like a mote!
5220,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,
5221,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Onward, still onward, onward, onward still!"
5222,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"And lo! thank Heaven, the mighty Organ hill,"
5223,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"That seemed a dim blue cloudlet at the start,"
5224,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Hangs in aerial, fluted cliffs aloft,--"
5225,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"And still as through the long, low glacis borne,"
5226,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Beneath the gorge borne ever at wild speed,"
5227,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,I saw the mateless mountain eagle wheel
5228,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,Beyond the stark height's topmost pinnacle;

5232,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"Another plain, tree-bordered now, and bound"
5233,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,By the clear river gurgling o'er its bed.
5234,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,
5235,WIDDERIN'S RACE.,"By this, my panting, but unconquered steed"
