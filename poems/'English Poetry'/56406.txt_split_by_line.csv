114,ACT·I,
115,_ALMEH._,_ALMEH._
116,_ALMEH._,
117,_ALMEH._,Why never came we here before? To think
118,_ALMEH._,"I have lived for eighteen years shut up in Fez,"
119,_ALMEH._,"Hemmed by the sandy desert, and all the while"
120,_ALMEH._,There was the sea! To have never seen the sea!
121,_ALMEH._,
122,_ZAPEL._,_ZAPEL._
123,_ZAPEL._,
124,_ZAPEL._,"If thou hadst ever seen it, where were now"
125,_ZAPEL._,Thy joy? ’tis novelty makes the delight.
126,_ZAPEL._,"To them that in this castle dwell, the sea"
127,_ZAPEL._,Is as the desert was to us at Fez.
128,_ZAPEL._,
129,_ZAPEL._,_Al._ Custom will dull the sense of any pleasure.
130,_ZAPEL._,"But set them down at Fez, would they not pine?      10"
131,_ZAPEL._,There’s life in the air. ’Twixt yon blue roomy dome
132,_ZAPEL._,And watery pavement the young winds charge forth
133,_ZAPEL._,Stored with refreshment: now we taste the springs
134,_ZAPEL._,"Man’s spirit should drink, the very mountain torrent"
135,_ZAPEL._,"Of heaven, that were content to slake our throats’"
136,_ZAPEL._,"Immortal thirst at stagnant pools. What, Zapel,"
137,_ZAPEL._,"Is the limit of our stay? now I am here,"
138,_ZAPEL._,I would abide for ever.
139,_ZAPEL._,
140,_ZAPEL._,_Za._                 I know as little
141,_ZAPEL._,"As thou. The king, thy sire, came here to fight"
142,_ZAPEL._,The unbelievers: when they are beaten back      20
143,_ZAPEL._,We shall go home. But why he sent for thee
144,_ZAPEL._,I cannot guess.
145,_ZAPEL._,
146,_ZAPEL._,"_Al._         Last night I know not, Zapel,"
147,_ZAPEL._,"Whether I slept or waked,—"
148,_ZAPEL._,
149,_ZAPEL._,_Za._                     Nor could I sleep.
150,_ZAPEL._,
151,_ZAPEL._,"_Al._ But as I lay and listened to the sea,"
152,_ZAPEL._,"I plainly heard a waft of singing voices,"
153,_ZAPEL._,"That rose and fell and died anon away,"
154,_ZAPEL._,Whiling the dark with some sweet lullaby.
155,_ZAPEL._,
156,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._ Why, ’twas the Christian captives that thou heardst."
157,_ZAPEL._,
158,_ZAPEL._,_Al._ Ah! prisoners in the castle: I had forgot:
159,_ZAPEL._,’Twas told me. And they are Christians! Can it be
160,_ZAPEL._,They sing so sweetly?
161,_ZAPEL._,
162,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._               Nay, I call it not sweet.      31"
163,_ZAPEL._,’Tis sadder than the moaning of the wind
164,_ZAPEL._,To hear them praise their god.
165,_ZAPEL._,
166,_ZAPEL._,"_Al._                        True, it was sad:"
167,_ZAPEL._,"Unearthly it seemed. Now more than ever, Zapel,"
168,_ZAPEL._,"I am glad I came; if there be Christians here,"
169,_ZAPEL._,And I may come to see them. All my life
170,_ZAPEL._,"I have heard strange things of them, and wondered much"
171,_ZAPEL._,What they were like. I’ll speak with them.
172,_ZAPEL._,
173,_ZAPEL._,_Za._                                    Ha! ha!
174,_ZAPEL._,
175,_ZAPEL._,_Al._ Why not?
176,_ZAPEL._,
177,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._        They lie chained in a noisome pit,"
178,_ZAPEL._,Where ’tis impossible to come.
179,_ZAPEL._,
180,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                        Who be they?      40
181,_ZAPEL._,What is their fault?
182,_ZAPEL._,
183,_ZAPEL._,_Za._              They are captives in the war.
184,_ZAPEL._,
185,_ZAPEL._,_Al._ My father doth not use his captives so.
186,_ZAPEL._,
187,_ZAPEL._,_Za._ They are unbelievers.
188,_ZAPEL._,
189,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                     True: yet that’s no crime
190,_ZAPEL._,But what they might impute to us. Were we
191,_ZAPEL._,"In their hands fallen, thus cut off from our homes,"
192,_ZAPEL._,’Twere cruel to be tortured for the faith.
193,_ZAPEL._,
194,_ZAPEL._,_Za._ They are worthless dogs.
195,_ZAPEL._,
196,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                        Alas! is all my teaching
197,_ZAPEL._,So cast away upon thy boorish soul?
198,_ZAPEL._,Pity makes brethren of our enemies.
199,_ZAPEL._,
200,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._ Forgive me, lady; I spoke in haste; and yet—"
201,_ZAPEL._,I would that thou couldst think as I.
202,_ZAPEL._,
203,_ZAPEL._,"_Al._                               Indeed,      51"
204,_ZAPEL._,"That were attainment. Vex me not, I bid thee;"
205,_ZAPEL._,But plan with me how I may see these captives:
206,_ZAPEL._,Were’t but to have them sing to me I’d do it:
207,_ZAPEL._,But curiosity and pity alike
208,_ZAPEL._,"Move me. If man is cruel, ’tis woman’s part"
209,_ZAPEL._,To ease the suffering which she cannot hinder.
210,_ZAPEL._,
211,_ZAPEL._,_Za._ How wouldst thou see them?
212,_ZAPEL._,
213,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                          I shall ask my father
214,_ZAPEL._,"To grant them, if it be but once a day,"
215,_ZAPEL._,To walk at liberty within the walls.      60
216,_ZAPEL._,
217,_ZAPEL._,_Za._ ’Tis pity Sala is not here.
218,_ZAPEL._,
219,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                           Thy meaning?
220,_ZAPEL._,
221,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._ The general hath the keeping of the castle,"
222,_ZAPEL._,"And he would work thy way in any wish,"
223,_ZAPEL._,Howe’er preposterous.
224,_ZAPEL._,
225,_ZAPEL._,_Al._               And thou sayst not ill.
226,_ZAPEL._,Sala is approachable and kind at heart:
227,_ZAPEL._,’Tis pity he is away.      [_Trumpets heard without._
228,_ZAPEL._,
229,_ZAPEL._,_Za._               Here comes the king;
230,_ZAPEL._,"He bade me shew thee hither in the garden,"
231,_ZAPEL._,And here will look to find thee.
232,_ZAPEL._,
233,_ZAPEL._,"_Al._                          Go, I bid thee,"
234,_ZAPEL._,And tell him that I am here.      [_Exit Zapel._
235,_ZAPEL._,Now shall I know why I was sent for hither.      70
236,_ZAPEL._,"Would ’twere to take this castle for my own,"
237,_ZAPEL._,With no more retinue than might suffice
238,_ZAPEL._,"To till this garden, and to cook my food."
239,_ZAPEL._,I’d win these Christian captives to my service
240,_ZAPEL._,"For ministers and minstrels; ay, and they"
241,_ZAPEL._,Should row me on the water. I’d have my books
242,_ZAPEL._,"In the northern tower, where set on high my lamp,"
243,_ZAPEL._,"Forestalling darkness with its seaward ray,"
244,_ZAPEL._,"Sailors should look for, and on tranquil nights"
245,_ZAPEL._,"Hear solemn music faintly, and believe      80"
246,_ZAPEL._,"There was enchantment. Could I have my will,"
247,_ZAPEL._,So would I live. And where’s the gain to be
248,_ZAPEL._,"The daughter of a king, if every wish"
249,_ZAPEL._,"Nearest one’s heart is of like course denied,"
250,_ZAPEL._,"As to the meanest peasant ... when one word,"
251,_ZAPEL._,One nod could grant it?
252,_ZAPEL._,
253,_ZAPEL._,_Enter King._
254,_ZAPEL._,
255,_KING._,_KING._
256,_KING._,
257,_KING._,Almeh! my rose of June!
258,_KING._,"Queen of my gardens, flower of all my kingdom!"
259,_KING._,
260,_KING._,"_Al._ Honour be thine, my sire."
261,_KING._,
262,_KING._,_K._                          I bring thee joy.
263,_KING._,Hast thou not wondered why I sent for thee?
264,_KING._,
265,_KING._,_Al._ Why was it? I long to know.
266,_KING._,
267,_KING._,_K._ (_giving_).                See for thyself.      90
268,_KING._,
269,_KING._,_Al._ A picture!
270,_KING._,
271,_KING._,_K._             ’Tis a portrait.
272,_KING._,
273,_KING._,_Al._                           And of whom?
274,_KING._,
275,_KING._,_K._ Dost thou not guess who this young Kaled is:
276,_KING._,"This high and dauntless brow, this stalwart arm,"
277,_KING._,Keen eye and martial poise?
278,_KING._,
279,_KING._,"_Al._                     If this be he,"
280,_KING._,"Who made of late entreaty for my hand,"
281,_KING._,Prince Tarudante ...
282,_KING._,
283,_KING._,"_K._               A happy omen. Ay,"
284,_KING._,"Look, girl, and love him, for he wooes thee well"
285,_KING._,With all Morocco.
286,_KING._,
287,_KING._,_Al._           Yet I cannot love
288,_KING._,Thy wish to banish me so far.
289,_KING._,
290,_KING._,_K._                        Thy marriage
291,_KING._,"Will bring Morocco nearer, and renew      100"
292,_KING._,Our old alliance: for thy valiant lover
293,_KING._,"Comes not with gold to woo thee, but sharp steel."
294,_KING._,"His flag is black, his ceremonious train"
295,_KING._,Are twenty thousand horsemen sworn to avenge
296,_KING._,The Prophet.... Ceuta will be mine.
297,_KING._,
298,_KING._,"_Al._                             Ah, sire!"
299,_KING._,I like not love that comes with war to woo.
300,_KING._,
301,_KING._,"_K._ But war that shall bring peace, whose lasting olive"
302,_KING._,"May not be sceptred in my hand, until"
303,_KING._,This fallen jewel be set back in my crown.
304,_KING._,Thy marriage with Morocco shall wipe out      110
305,_KING._,The old dishonour that hath vexed my reign.
306,_KING._,
307,_KING._,"_Al._ And yet doth Ceuta, sire, in all thy kingdom"
308,_KING._,Rank as a little town.
309,_KING._,
310,_KING._,_K._                 Thou art a woman;
311,_KING._,"How can I show thee? This anemone,"
312,_KING._,"’Tis beautiful, nor canst thou say its grace"
313,_KING._,Resides in this part nor in that: but look;
314,_KING._,I pluck a petal from it.—Thou beholdest
315,_KING._,My kingdom without Ceuta. Wouldst thou wish
316,_KING._,To set this back unto the perfect flower?
317,_KING._,
318,_KING._,_Al._ How could I do it?
319,_KING._,
320,_KING._,_K._                   I must tell thee all.      120
321,_KING._,"Our ancestors, thou knowest, blest be their names,"
322,_KING._,"Long ruled in Spain, and made that coign of the earth"
323,_KING._,The glory of all; but to the peaceful arts
324,_KING._,"Turning their genius when they sat to rule,"
325,_KING._,"Their prudence slept: for that half-barbarous race,"
326,_KING._,"Whom conquering they had spared, grew up more apt"
327,_KING._,"In arms, and rising ’gainst our easy folk"
328,_KING._,"O’erthrew and dispossest them;—and, not content"
329,_KING._,"To have driven us out of Spain, pursued us hither,"
330,_KING._,Where in our southern bounds we lived retired      130
331,_KING._,Behind the ocean as an ample shield.
332,_KING._,"’Twas in thy grandsire’s time, ere thou wert born,"
333,_KING._,They did this wrong; the boastful Portuguese
334,_KING._,"Swoln with malevolence,—why should I say it?—"
335,_KING._,"King Joam and his sons, all unprovoked,"
336,_KING._,"For we had oaths of peace, attacked us here"
337,_KING._,"With sudden treacherous assault, and seized"
338,_KING._,"Ceuta, our strongest barrier thitherward."
339,_KING._,"Impregnable we deemed it, and indeed"
340,_KING._,Impregnable have found it ’gainst ourselves      140
341,_KING._,For twenty years besieging it in vain.
342,_KING._,"Then should this shame, unbearable to us,"
343,_KING._,"Prove but incitement to our foes, a foothold"
344,_KING._,For further wresting. Two months have not passed
345,_KING._,Since that a new Armada sailed from Tagus
346,_KING._,"Against Tangiers, and both by land and sea"
347,_KING._,"Beleaguering would have reft that city too,"
348,_KING._,"And added my dishonour to my father’s,"
349,_KING._,Had not Ben Sala’s generalship o’ermatched
350,_KING._,Their most infernal malice. Praised be Allah!      150
351,_KING._,"They fell, they fled; and such as fled not lie"
352,_KING._,"Dead on our sands, or in our dungeons chained."
353,_KING._,
354,_KING._,_Al._ Are those the captives in the castle pit?
355,_KING._,
356,_KING._,"_K._ Ay, but thou breakst my tale;—mark what I tell.—"
357,_KING._,"The victory mine, I looked to make fair peace,"
358,_KING._,And would have given my prisoners in exchange
359,_KING._,"For Ceuta; but the prince of Portugal,"
360,_KING._,"Behind those walls retired, refused the ransom;"
361,_KING._,And gathering reinforcement hath come forth
362,_KING._,To devastate the country. ’Tis ’gainst him      160
363,_KING._,That Sala marched five days ago. Meanwhile
364,_KING._,"Morocco, who was treating for thy hand,"
365,_KING._,"Heard tidings of our war, and having now"
366,_KING._,"An armament collected ’gainst the tribes,"
367,_KING._,Has turned it to my rescue. ’Twas for this
368,_KING._,I sent for thee; in furtherance of thy marriage;
369,_KING._,Hoping thereby to bind him in the terms
370,_KING._,"I have to tell thee. However Sala fare,"
371,_KING._,"And hitherto no news comes from his camp,"
372,_KING._,’Twere no achievement worthy of Tarudante      170
373,_KING._,To make dispersal of a broken foe:
374,_KING._,I shall propose a greater enterprise;
375,_KING._,I’ll say ’Thou wilt not grudge to sweep the bounds
376,_KING._,"Of the fair realm, whose heiress thou wouldst wed."
377,_KING._,Make we this compact—Win me Ceuta back
378,_KING._,"And drive the idolaters across the sea,"
379,_KING._,Ere thou take home my daughter for thy queen.’
380,_KING._,
381,_KING._,"_Al._ But doth Morocco, sire, know I am here?"
382,_KING._,
383,_KING._,"_K._ Nay, nor myself knew, when I sent for thee,"
384,_KING._,How ’twould fall out: ’twas timed most happily.      180
385,_KING._,
386,_KING._,"_Al._ But coming not to woo, may he not find"
387,_KING._,Offence in the constraint; as I confess
388,_KING._,"I feel to lay it on him, tho’my lover?"
389,_KING._,
390,_KING._,"_K._ Nay, nay, girl; he is in earnest; meet him frankly;"
391,_KING._,’Tis by his love thou shalt restore my town.
392,_KING._,
393,_KING._,_Enter Messenger._
394,_KING._,
395,_MESSENGER._,_MESSENGER._
396,_MESSENGER._,
397,_MESSENGER._,"News from the army, Sire."
398,_MESSENGER._,
399,_MESSENGER._,_K._                      Thou lookest black:
400,_MESSENGER._,What is it? speak.
401,_MESSENGER._,
402,_MESSENGER._,"_Mess._          O mighty king, ’tis ill."
403,_MESSENGER._,Sala ben Sala’s forces were attacked
404,_MESSENGER._,At nightfall by the Christians. In the dark
405,_MESSENGER._,Was battle waged. By morn what men remained      190
406,_MESSENGER._,And all the camp were captive.
407,_MESSENGER._,
408,_MESSENGER._,_K._                         God forbid!
409,_MESSENGER._,Five thousand men were there: be none escaped?
410,_MESSENGER._,
411,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ Such as in darkness fled.
412,_MESSENGER._,
413,_MESSENGER._,_K._                            And fledst thou thence?
414,_MESSENGER._,
415,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ The general sent me on.
416,_MESSENGER._,
417,_MESSENGER._,_K._                          And what of him?
418,_MESSENGER._,
419,_MESSENGER._,"_Mess._ The dawn discovered him, when all was lost,"
420,_MESSENGER._,"Fighting on foot upon a little hill,"
421,_MESSENGER._,"Surrounded by the foe; when seeing no hope,"
422,_MESSENGER._,"He made surrender to the Christian leader,"
423,_MESSENGER._,Who gave him liberty. Thus far to tell
424,_MESSENGER._,"He bade, and that he followed speedily.      200"
425,_MESSENGER._,
426,_MESSENGER._,_K._ When will he come?
427,_MESSENGER._,
428,_MESSENGER._,"_Mess._               Sire, tho’I used all duty,"
429,_MESSENGER._,He hath overtaken me and dismounts without.
430,_MESSENGER._,
431,_MESSENGER._,"_K._ Go, wait upon him.      [_Exit Messenger._"
432,_MESSENGER._,Accursed be the seed
433,_MESSENGER._,"Of these idolaters. Five thousand men,"
434,_MESSENGER._,The best in Fez: the right arm of my power
435,_MESSENGER._,Lost in one night. Five thousand men were there.
436,_MESSENGER._,Ah! by God’s holiest names!
437,_MESSENGER._,
438,_MESSENGER._,"_Al._                     Thank heaven, dear father,"
439,_MESSENGER._,"The best is saved, if Sala be escaped."
440,_MESSENGER._,
441,_MESSENGER._,"_K._ True, girl: and from the ill there’s good to come:"
442,_MESSENGER._,Their victory will lead these devils on.      210
443,_MESSENGER._,"Ay, they will come. They know not of Morocco;"
444,_MESSENGER._,They run into a trap.
445,_MESSENGER._,
446,_MESSENGER._,_Al._               Will you make peace?
447,_MESSENGER._,
448,_MESSENGER._,_K._ God bids us smite these hogs: I would that hell
449,_MESSENGER._,Were deeper to receive them.
450,_MESSENGER._,
451,_MESSENGER._,_Enter Sala._
452,_MESSENGER._,
453,_MESSENGER._,"Sala ben Sala, peace be with thee!"
454,_MESSENGER._,
455,_SALA._,_SALA._
456,_SALA._,
457,_SALA._,"The peace of heaven be thine, my king!"
458,_SALA._,
459,_SALA._,_K._                                   Thou comest
460,_SALA._,Most swiftly from the battle.
461,_SALA._,
462,_SALA._,_Sa._                       With less haste
463,_SALA._,Than needed; but fatigue and wounds delayed me.
464,_SALA._,"What see I? The princess here! Alas, alas!"
465,_SALA._,O my disaster!
466,_SALA._,
467,_SALA._,"_Al._        Now I thank God, Sala,      220"
468,_SALA._,That thou’rt alive.
469,_SALA._,
470,_SALA._,_Sa._             To such shame is not good.
471,_SALA._,"Sire, while there’s time, escape; and leave me here"
472,_SALA._,To hold the castle for thee as I may.
473,_SALA._,
474,_SALA._,"_K._ Have thou no fear, Sala. My daughter, go:"
475,_SALA._,"Leave us alone: or better sit thou there,"
476,_SALA._,"And hear what Sala tells: and, Sala, thou"
477,_SALA._,"Begin the tale, for which thy messenger"
478,_SALA._,Hath well prepared my ear. Here is thy seat.
479,_SALA._,
480,_SALA._,"_Sa._ Hear then, my liege, what happened, as I tell."
481,_SALA._,(_Aside._) Yet how to tell my shame in Almeh’s ears?—
482,_SALA._,’Tis the fifth day since thou didst send me forth      231
483,_SALA._,"Against the Christian bands, which as we learned"
484,_SALA._,Harassed the plains of Ceuta.—Thither I marched
485,_SALA._,"Four thousand strong, besides our cavalry"
486,_SALA._,And bowmen: Here and there some small encounters
487,_SALA._,"Drove back the foe within the gates, and then"
488,_SALA._,"I made return, establishing the country"
489,_SALA._,"And strengthening the garrisons, nor heard"
490,_SALA._,That any greater force had come afield:
491,_SALA._,When yesterday at noon our scouts espied       240
492,_SALA._,The flash of arms and dust of troops moving
493,_SALA._,"Among the hills: thither we turned our face,"
494,_SALA._,"And had no fear but for the foe’s escape,"
495,_SALA._,Nor guessed how much the lurking enemy
496,_SALA._,"Outmatched our weakened numbers. What surprise,—"
497,_SALA._,"I blame myself,—then, when our scouts came in"
498,_SALA._,"At sunset with the tidings that the foe,"
499,_SALA._,"Whom we thought flying from us, held the pass"
500,_SALA._,Against our coming. Straight I chose a spot
501,_SALA._,"Such as we might defend, and there encamped,      250"
502,_SALA._,"And would have stayed till morn, when suddenly"
503,_SALA._,The stragglers on our rear were driven in
504,_SALA._,By horse that fell upon our flank; and soon
505,_SALA._,"I heard our front engaged. The moon to them,"
506,_SALA._,"—That was our peril,—the accursed yellow moon"
507,_SALA._,"Exposed our camp, while in the shadowy glens"
508,_SALA._,The night hid their attack: our disposition
509,_SALA._,"Was else not ill. Taking sufficient force,"
510,_SALA._,I turned to clear the rear; but in the dark
511,_SALA._,"Met with great numbers. How we fought God knows,"
512,_SALA._,Surrounded on all hands. If any fled         261
513,_SALA._,"I cannot guess: but battling there till dawn,"
514,_SALA._,I saw at daybreak there were left with me
515,_SALA._,But hundreds against thousands. Then to save
516,_SALA._,"The needless slaughter, I gave up my sword"
517,_SALA._,"Unto the Christian leader, Ferdinand"
518,_SALA._,Of Portugal; nor ever had here returned
519,_SALA._,"To speak of the disaster, but that prince,"
520,_SALA._,"Clement as valiant, questioned courteously"
521,_SALA._,"My name, and hearing it returned my sword,            270"
522,_SALA._,And bidding me choose out from all his suite
523,_SALA._,"What horse I fancied,—for my own was killed,—"
524,_SALA._,"He raised his helm, and said,"
525,_SALA._,"‘Go free, brave Sala; ride and tell thy king"
526,_SALA._,We follow thee to rescue from his hands
527,_SALA._,The prisoners he withholds:’ That is my tale.
528,_SALA._,"Allah is great, and what he doth to-day"
529,_SALA._,To-morrow he may undo.
530,_SALA._,
531,_SALA._,_K._                 This courteous Christian
532,_SALA._,"Is but a fool: for had he kept thee fast,"
533,_SALA._,He might have had his men in thy exchange.          280
534,_SALA._,
535,_SALA._,_Sa._ No less now must thou grant them.
536,_SALA._,
537,_SALA._,"_K._                                  No, by God."
538,_SALA._,"Hark, Sala: these few days thou hast been away"
539,_SALA._,Have brought me from the east four times the force
540,_SALA._,Which thou ill-fatedly hast lost. Morocco
541,_SALA._,"Lies camped a short league hence, and in his tents"
542,_SALA._,Are twenty thousand men.
543,_SALA._,
544,_SALA._,_Sa._                  Morocco is here?
545,_SALA._,
546,_SALA._,_K._ Said I not well? Is he not one to meet
547,_SALA._,These Christians? Let them come. How many be they?
548,_SALA._,
549,_SALA._,"_Sa._ Eight, maybe, or nine thousand. Where’s Morocco?"
550,_SALA._,
551,_SALA._,_K._ At Alcabar. When look they to be here?         290
552,_SALA._,
553,_SALA._,"_Sa._ They have no thought we can oppose their host,"
554,_SALA._,And will not hasten.
555,_SALA._,
556,_SALA._,_K._               We will be ready for them.
557,_SALA._,Prepare to leave by noon: thou must collect
558,_SALA._,What men thou canst. I will go write my summons
559,_SALA._,To Tarudante. Stay: I have not enquired
560,_SALA._,What are thy wounds.
561,_SALA._,
562,_SALA._,_Sa._              Nothing that should forbid
563,_SALA._,"Immediate service: food, an hour of rest"
564,_SALA._,Will make me fit.
565,_SALA._,
566,_SALA._,_K._            In three hours be thou ready.      [_Exit._
567,_SALA._,
568,_SALA._,
569,_SALA._,"_Al._ Go thou within, Sala; and rest thee now."
570,_SALA._,Or wilt thou first take food?
571,_SALA._,
572,_SALA._,_Sa._                       There’s time enough.           300
573,_SALA._,"Bid me not hence, my rest and food are here."
574,_SALA._,How cam’st thou hither?
575,_SALA._,
576,_SALA._,_Al._                 The king sent for me.
577,_SALA._,
578,_SALA._,"_Sa._ And why? Thee in the camp! O beauteous Almeh,"
579,_SALA._,"Dost thou think vilely of me, that the Christian"
580,_SALA._,Surprised and overcame me? If I had known
581,_SALA._,That thou wast here ...
582,_SALA._,
583,_SALA._,"_Al._                 Stay, Sala: thou wilt hurt"
584,_SALA._,Thy soldiership. I doubt not Ferdinand
585,_SALA._,Is a most worthy foe: I rather fear
586,_SALA._,He hath a quality unconquerable.
587,_SALA._,
588,_SALA._,_Sa._ Ha! then I am scorned.      310
589,_SALA._,
590,_SALA._,_Al._                      I mean he is generous:
591,_SALA._,He set thee free. Couldst thou not match that deed?
592,_SALA._,
593,_SALA._,_Sa._ As friend or foe I would outmatch him bravely.
594,_SALA._,Nay but to see him in his angel-fairness
595,_SALA._,"Provoked my emulation, and I vowed"
596,_SALA._,"Some day to kill his horse, and take his sword,"
597,_SALA._,And cry him quit.
598,_SALA._,
599,_SALA._,_Al._           Still thou’rt for war: ’twere better
600,_SALA._,"Repay him with the gift that he demands,"
601,_SALA._,These miserable captives.
602,_SALA._,
603,_SALA._,_Sa._                   I would have done so.
604,_SALA._,But thou didst hear the king refuse. He is sworn
605,_SALA._,To grant no terms till Ceuta be restored.      320
606,_SALA._,"Our law moreover doth forbid this traffic,"
607,_SALA._,To exchange our captives with the infidels.
608,_SALA._,
609,_SALA._,"_Al._ But hast thou then thyself, Sala, no power"
610,_SALA._,To do them any kindness; or for me
611,_SALA._,Wilt thou not grant them so much liberty
612,_SALA._,As to walk in the garden once a day?
613,_SALA._,If I might speak with them I might do somewhat
614,_SALA._,To pay the debt we owe their general;
615,_SALA._,"And to speak truth, for my own sake I ask it."
616,_SALA._,
617,_SALA._,_Sa._ How for thy sake?
618,_SALA._,
619,_SALA._,_Al._                 I wish to hear them sing.      330
620,_SALA._,
621,_SALA._,_Sa._ How could that please? Who told thee that they sing?
622,_SALA._,
623,_SALA._,"_Al._ ’Twas last night, Sala, as I lay long awake"
624,_SALA._,"Dreamily hearkening to the ocean murmur,"
625,_SALA._,"Softer than silence, on mine ears there stole"
626,_SALA._,A solemn sound of wailful harmony:
627,_SALA._,So beautiful it was that first I thought
628,_SALA._,"This castle was enchanted, as I have read"
629,_SALA._,In eastern tales; or else that ’twas the song
630,_SALA._,"Of people of this land, who make the sea"
631,_SALA._,"Their secret god, and at midnight arise       340"
632,_SALA._,"To kneel upon the shore, and his divinity"
633,_SALA._,Trouble with shrilling prayer: or then it seemed
634,_SALA._,A liquid-voicèd choir of spirits that swam
635,_SALA._,"Upon the ocean surface, harp in hand,"
636,_SALA._,Swelling their hymns with his deep undersong.
637,_SALA._,That was the Christian captives.
638,_SALA._,
639,_SALA._,_Sa._                            ’Twas the night
640,_SALA._,Softened their wails to sweetness: as the space
641,_SALA._,’Twixt hell and heaven makes the cries of the damned
642,_SALA._,Music to the angels.
643,_SALA._,
644,_SALA._,"_Al._              Sala, ’tis not the king,"
645,_SALA._,’Tis thou art cruel; thou hast a heart of hate.      350
646,_SALA._,
647,_SALA._,"_Sa._ O nay, a heart of love. I would not count"
648,_SALA._,"Dishonour, Almeh; I would be at peace"
649,_SALA._,"With shame and infidels and all the world,"
650,_SALA._,Wouldst thou be mine.
651,_SALA._,
652,_SALA._,"_Al._               Now, if my father heard thee!"
653,_SALA._,"Thou dar’st much, thinking that I cannot tell:"
654,_SALA._,"Which if I have never done, ’tis that I am loth"
655,_SALA._,To lose so old a friend; ’tis pain to see
656,_SALA._,"That as I am grown from childhood, thou art grown"
657,_SALA._,"From friendship, and for loving me too much"
658,_SALA._,Must love me now no more.
659,_SALA._,
660,_SALA._,_Sa._                   Ah! what is that?      360
661,_SALA._,A portrait in thy hand? Nay show it me.
662,_SALA._,Why dost thou blush? Who is the happy one
663,_SALA._,Thou carriest thus to gaze on?
664,_SALA._,
665,_SALA._,_Al._                        Look and see.
666,_SALA._,
667,_SALA._,"_Sa._ ’Tis Tarudante. O thou faithless Almeh,"
668,_SALA._,To speak of friendship who hast never told me
669,_SALA._,Thou hast a lover. Now I see the cause
670,_SALA._,"Why thou art here. This boy.—’Tis a smooth cheek,"
671,_SALA._,A pretty picture. Ah! wert thou not shamed
672,_SALA._,To slight me for a sprinkling of grey hair
673,_SALA._,"About my temples, thou wouldst never thus      370"
674,_SALA._,Have hid thy passion.
675,_SALA._,
676,_SALA._,_Al._               Tho’thou hast stolen from me
677,_SALA._,"A privilege to love me, I deny thee"
678,_SALA._,The liberty to judge me and reprove.
679,_SALA._,
680,_SALA._,"_Sa._ Ever, when thou hast bidden my love be dumb,"
681,_SALA._,"My tongue hath been obedient: but my anger,"
682,_SALA._,My jealousy will speak. How gottest thou this?
683,_SALA._,
684,_SALA._,"_Al._ Question not so, or I will never tell."
685,_SALA._,
686,_SALA._,"_Sa._ Have pity, Almeh, and tell me."
687,_SALA._,
688,_SALA._,_Al._                              Then ’tis thus.
689,_SALA._,"My father gave it me this very hour,"
690,_SALA._,As herald of the prince whom it portrays.       380
691,_SALA._,"He comes on double mission, first to fight"
692,_SALA._,Against our foes ...
693,_SALA._,
694,_SALA._,"_Sa._              Hast thou consented, Almeh?"
695,_SALA._,
696,_SALA._,"_Al._ If ’tis my father’s will, and if the prince"
697,_SALA._,Be earnest in his courtship ...
698,_SALA._,
699,_SALA._,_Sa._                         Ah! thou dost wish it.
700,_SALA._,
701,_SALA._,_Al._ My wish can count but little: but my wish
702,_SALA._,Is not for this nor any other marriage.
703,_SALA._,
704,_SALA._,_Sa._ Thou hast yielded to the thought. Would I had died
705,_SALA._,On Ferdinand’s sword; or that his ear had ne’er
706,_SALA._,"Heard my ill-fated name, Sala, far happier"
707,_SALA._,"Chained in a Spanish galley, than set free       390"
708,_SALA._,To find thee in a rival’s arms.
709,_SALA._,
710,_SALA._,_Al._                         O shame!
711,_SALA._,How have I yielded?
712,_SALA._,
713,_SALA._,_Sa._             Thou hast taken in hand
714,_SALA._,This cursèd portrait: held it ...
715,_SALA._,
716,_SALA._,"_Al._                           Nay, I pray."
717,_SALA._,
718,_SALA._,"_Sa._ Gazed on it, fondled it: a pictured boy!"
719,_SALA._,Thy champion.
720,_SALA._,
721,_SALA._,_Al._       I bid thee think....
722,_SALA._,
723,_SALA._,_Sa._                          A painted image!
724,_SALA._,
725,_SALA._,"_Al._ And what, pray, wouldst thou have had me do?"
726,_SALA._,
727,_SALA._,_Sa._                                     What do?
728,_SALA._,Never to have taken it: refused it: scorned it:
729,_SALA._,Cast it beneath thy feet: trodden it to atoms.
730,_SALA._,
731,_SALA._,"_Al._ Thou wrongst me, Sala, now: thou art overcome"
732,_SALA._,With fasting and much fighting.
733,_SALA._,
734,_SALA._,"_Sa._                         O, I am wronged      400"
735,_SALA._,To have the temper of my passion judged
736,_SALA._,"As hunger or fatigue. Here is thy picture,"
737,_SALA._,"Thy lover. Take it back. Farewell. I go,"
738,_SALA._,"But not to eat or rest. Almeh, farewell:"
739,_SALA._,I would have died for thee.
740,_SALA._,
741,_SALA._,"_Al._                     Nay, go not thus"
742,_SALA._,Unkindly.
743,_SALA._,
744,_SALA._,"_Sa._     ’Tis farewell: but not unkindness,"
745,_SALA._,"Lest thou shouldst say my last word was unkindness,"
746,_SALA._,"I will go seek the king, and shall persuade him"
747,_SALA._,Ere I depart to grant the Christian captives
748,_SALA._,The little liberty which thou hast asked:      410
749,_SALA._,Then to the war; wherein I pray that heaven
750,_SALA._,Hath laid my death: if anywhere on earth
751,_SALA._,"Within my reach, I’ll find it. O farewell."
752,_SALA._,The Angels guard thee.      [_Going._
753,_SALA._,
754,_SALA._,_Al._                I bid thee go not thus.

796,_ALMEH._,Is sweeter than whatever I have heard
797,_ALMEH._,"In mosque or sacred temple, or the chant"
798,_ALMEH._,"Of holy pilgrims, that beguile the road."
799,_ALMEH._,"I’ll learn what they will tell me of their hymns,"
800,_ALMEH._,"And whence they have this music. Ah, they see me."
801,_ALMEH._,"Sir, pray withdraw not thus. Step on this terrace;"
802,_ALMEH._,Hence may you view the sea. Your helpless lot
803,_ALMEH._,I pity; and if indeed I have any power
804,_ALMEH._,"To ease the pains of your captivity,      440"
805,_ALMEH._,’Tis but a debt I owe you for the pleasure
806,_ALMEH._,Your music wakes within me. Come this way.
807,_ALMEH._,
808,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._ Lady, we thank thy grace and gentleness:"
809,_ALMEH._,"But yonder grove contents us, in the shade"
810,_ALMEH._,"Where if we walked retired, we shall not strain"
811,_ALMEH._,The privilege we prize.
812,_ALMEH._,
813,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                 Why, since I ask,"
814,_ALMEH._,"Take courage, come. There’s none will see but I."
815,_ALMEH._,
816,_ALMEH._,_Ch._ We dare not disobey.
817,_ALMEH._,
818,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                    Come forward, hither."
819,_ALMEH._,I bid you all for pleasure as my friends.
820,_ALMEH._,"And ye could much delight me, would ye tell      450"
821,_ALMEH._,What theme ye lately sang: for though sweet music
822,_ALMEH._,"Needs no interpretation, yet the thought"
823,_ALMEH._,That gives occasion to the smile of love
824,_ALMEH._,Is dear itself; and I am like a lover
825,_ALMEH._,"Wondering what fancy ’twas, that bred a strain"
826,_ALMEH._,Of such deliberate joy.
827,_ALMEH._,
828,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._                 Forbid the thought,"
829,_ALMEH._,"Lady: the sea, with whose expansive sight"
830,_ALMEH._,"Thou thoughtest to rejoice our prisoned eyes,"
831,_ALMEH._,Doth not dissever us from our lost homes
832,_ALMEH._,"With wider deeper gulf, than that which lies      460"
833,_ALMEH._,Betwixt our souls and thine. Thou mayst not know.
834,_ALMEH._,
835,_ALMEH._,_Al._ I know ye sang of Jesus.
836,_ALMEH._,
837,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._                        And knowing that,"
838,_ALMEH._,Wouldst thou know more?
839,_ALMEH._,
840,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                 Ay, tell me."
841,_ALMEH._,
842,_ALMEH._,_Ch._                              Praised be God!
843,_ALMEH._,
844,_ALMEH._,_Al._ I envy you your skill. I prithee tell me
845,_ALMEH._,What was’t ye sang.
846,_ALMEH._,
847,_ALMEH._,_Ch._             The praise of Jesus’name.
848,_ALMEH._,’Tis what all nature sings; the whole creation
849,_ALMEH._,"Ceaseth not, nor is silent in his praise:"
850,_ALMEH._,"Neither God’s angels, nor the spirit of man"
851,_ALMEH._,"With speech directed unto him, nor things"
852,_ALMEH._,"Animate nor inanimate, by the mouth      470"
853,_ALMEH._,Of them that meditate thereon: which praise
854,_ALMEH._,"Music hath perfected, and that we use"
855,_ALMEH._,"Less for his glory, than that thence our souls"
856,_ALMEH._,"May from their weariness arise to him,"
857,_ALMEH._,In whom is our refreshment and true strength.
858,_ALMEH._,
859,_ALMEH._,_Al._ I pray you sing again.
860,_ALMEH._,
861,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._                      If thou wilt hear,"
862,_ALMEH._,We will sing more.
863,_ALMEH._,
864,_ALMEH._,"_O Jesu mi dulcissime,"
865,_ALMEH._,"O spes spirantis animæ,"
866,_ALMEH._,"Te quærunt piæ lacrymæ,"
867,_ALMEH._,Et clamor mentis intimæ._
868,_ALMEH._,
869,_ALMEH._,_Al._ Music ne’er found a better speech. I pray      482
870,_ALMEH._,Could I sing with you? Could I learn your art?
871,_ALMEH._,
872,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._ Thou hast the master-secret, loving it."
873,_ALMEH._,
874,_ALMEH._,"_Al._ Many have that: and I can sing alone,"
875,_ALMEH._,But ne’er have learned your many-voicèd skill.
876,_ALMEH._,
877,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._ That is the maker’s art: the song being made,"
878,_ALMEH._,"’Tis to sing strictly, and to teach thy phrase"
879,_ALMEH._,"Confident rivalry, as if thou knewest"
880,_ALMEH._,"Thy passion was the deepest, and could blend      490"
881,_ALMEH._,The wandering strains in closer harmony.
882,_ALMEH._,
883,_ALMEH._,_Al._ Make me your pupil. How should I begin?
884,_ALMEH._,
885,_ALMEH._,[_Drums and trumpets without._
886,_ALMEH._,
887,_ALMEH._,_Ch._ The king!
888,_ALMEH._,
889,_ALMEH._,"_Al._         Break off, my father is returned;"
890,_ALMEH._,"Lest he should enter here, haste to your bounds,"
891,_ALMEH._,"And be not seen. There will I visit you,"
892,_ALMEH._,Or bid you forth again.
893,_ALMEH._,
894,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._                 We thank thee, lady."
895,_ALMEH._,
896,_ALMEH._,"_Re-enter Zapel, hurriedly._"
897,_ALMEH._,
898,_ALMEH._,"_Za._ My lady, hast thou heard?"
899,_ALMEH._,
900,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                         What is it, Zapel?"
901,_ALMEH._,
902,_ALMEH._,"_Za._ The infidels are routed, and the king"
903,_ALMEH._,"Is coming from the field with Tarudante,"
904,_ALMEH._,"Prince of Morocco, and between them ride      500"
905,_ALMEH._,"The two chief captains of the unbelievers,"
906,_ALMEH._,Princes of Portugal: be Allah praised.
907,_ALMEH._,
908,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._ Alas! O woe, alas! Forgive us, lady,"
909,_ALMEH._,That thus we weep before thee.
910,_ALMEH._,
911,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                        Nay, be sure"
912,_ALMEH._,"I pity you myself, and could not blame"
913,_ALMEH._,"Your natural grief. But ’tis the vice of war,"
914,_ALMEH._,"That whatsoever side hath victory,"
915,_ALMEH._,"The misery is alike, nor in the advantage"
916,_ALMEH._,Is aught to compensate the evil done.
917,_ALMEH._,May God give strength to right!
918,_ALMEH._,
919,_ALMEH._,"_Ch._                         Amen, Amen!      510"
920,_ALMEH._,"(_To Z._) Pray, lady, didst thou say Prince Ferdinand"
921,_ALMEH._,Was taken?
922,_ALMEH._,
923,_ALMEH._,_Za._    Ye may question him himself;
924,_ALMEH._,Talk not with me.
925,_ALMEH._,
926,_ALMEH._,"_Al._           I beg you, friends, be gone:"
927,_ALMEH._,Ye must not stay.
928,_ALMEH._,
929,_ALMEH._,_Ch._           We will depart and mourn
930,_ALMEH._,Within our sultry pit.                   [_Exeunt._
931,_ALMEH._,
932,_ALMEH._,_Al._                My father comes?
933,_ALMEH._,
934,_ALMEH._,_Za._ He is at the gate.
935,_ALMEH._,
936,_ALMEH._,_Al._                  Whate’er thou’st seen or heard
937,_ALMEH._,"Between me and these hapless prisoners,"
938,_ALMEH._,See that thou tell not.
939,_ALMEH._,
940,_ALMEH._,_Za._                 ’Tis an accursed thing.
941,_ALMEH._,
942,_ALMEH._,"_Al._ ’Tis not for thee to judge, but do my bidding."
943,_ALMEH._,
944,_ALMEH._,_Za._ And thou shouldst trust me better.
945,_ALMEH._,
946,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                                  I do trust thee,"
947,_ALMEH._,And therefore bid thee thus.
948,_ALMEH._,
949,_ALMEH._,_Za._                      And I obey.      521
950,_ALMEH._,
951,_ALMEH._,"_Al._ Is not this Ferdinand they spoke of, he"
952,_ALMEH._,Whose chivalry we thank for Sala’s life?
953,_ALMEH._,
954,_ALMEH._,_Za._ That’s he.
955,_ALMEH._,
956,_ALMEH._,"_Al._          Then I shall see this red-crossed knight,"
957,_ALMEH._,The noblest of them all. The general said
958,_ALMEH._,He was of angel fairness: then he is cousin
959,_ALMEH._,To the emperor of England.
960,_ALMEH._,
961,_ALMEH._,_Za._                    Thou shalt see
962,_ALMEH._,"A Moor worth fifty Christian Portuguese,"
963,_ALMEH._,"His conqueror, thy lover Tarudante,"
964,_ALMEH._,Heir of Morocco.
965,_ALMEH._,
966,_ALMEH._,_Al._          Silence: see they come.      530
967,_ALMEH._,
968,_ALMEH._,"_Enter King with Tarudante and Ferdinand, followed by Enrique and Sala._"
969,_ALMEH._,
970,_ALMEH._,_Za._ (_to A._). There’s Tarudante.
971,_ALMEH._,
972,_ALMEH._,_Al._ (_aside_).                  There is Ferdinand.
973,_ALMEH._,
974,_ALMEH._,_KING_ (_to T._).
975,_ALMEH._,
976,_ALMEH._,"Now, noble prince, thou hast overcome our foes;"
977,_ALMEH._,"This is thy second battlefield, whereon"
978,_ALMEH._,Thy love may win like conquest as thy sword.
979,_ALMEH._,"Pitch here thy tent, and make thy war in peace."
980,_ALMEH._,Forget the reeking and gore-dappled plain
981,_ALMEH._,"Mid scent of pinks and jasmin, and the flush"
982,_ALMEH._,Of oleander and full-blooded rose.
983,_ALMEH._,"See, I will lead thee to the virgin fortress"
984,_ALMEH._,"That thou mayst kneel to take. Come hither, Almeh:"
985,_ALMEH._,"Here is the prince thy lover. Tarudante,      541"
986,_ALMEH._,Behold her whom I offer thee for queen.
987,_ALMEH._,
988,_ALMEH._,"_Al._ (_aside, coming forward_). Now of these two"
989,_ALMEH._,might I but choose.
990,_ALMEH._,
991,_ALMEH._,"_K._                 Come, daughter,"
992,_ALMEH._,Put off this modesty.
993,_ALMEH._,
994,_ALMEH._,_Al._ (_aside_).    My eyes refuse him.
995,_ALMEH._,
996,_TARUDANTE._,_TARUDANTE._
997,_TARUDANTE._,
998,_TARUDANTE._,"Lady, forgive my boldness in desiring"
999,_TARUDANTE._,"What I had never seen. Thy beauty’s fame,"
1000,_TARUDANTE._,The high nobility of this alliance
1001,_TARUDANTE._,"Led me so far; but now I have seen, I see"
1002,_TARUDANTE._,"I must be bolder, or renounce my boldness,"
1003,_TARUDANTE._,That begged a grace so far beyond my thought.      550
1004,_TARUDANTE._,
1005,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ I should be much ashamed, prince, if thy suit,"
1006,_TARUDANTE._,"Which seeks the honour of my father’s house,"
1007,_TARUDANTE._,Stumbled at my unworthiness: but praise
1008,_TARUDANTE._,"Of pictures,—and mere beauty is no more,—"
1009,_TARUDANTE._,Exalteth but the maker. May the days
1010,_TARUDANTE._,Thou spendest here with us be rich in peace.      [_Going._
1011,_TARUDANTE._,
1012,_TARUDANTE._,_FERDINAND_ (_aside to En._).
1013,_TARUDANTE._,
1014,_TARUDANTE._,"By heaven, the devil is gentle to these Moors:"
1015,_TARUDANTE._,They match our folk in beauty as in arms.
1016,_TARUDANTE._,
1017,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ Stay, Almeh, stay!               [_Almeh turns._"
1018,_TARUDANTE._,
1019,_TARUDANTE._,_ENRIQUE_ (_to F._).
1020,_TARUDANTE._,
1021,_TARUDANTE._,These be the Spanish Arab: such a race
1022,_TARUDANTE._,Sprang never from the sooty loins of Ham.      560
1023,_TARUDANTE._,
1024,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ (_to K._). Excuse me, sire, I pray."
1025,_TARUDANTE._,
1026,_TARUDANTE._,[_Exit with Zapel._
1027,_TARUDANTE._,
1028,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ (_to En._). Devil or angel or Arab, she hath stolen my soul."
1029,_TARUDANTE._,
1030,_TARUDANTE._,"_Tar._ Such perfect grace, such speech and modesty"
1031,_TARUDANTE._,Outbid my fancy; I would fight thy battles
1032,_TARUDANTE._,For twenty years to call thy treasure mine.
1033,_TARUDANTE._,
1034,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ I say she is thine, and she is my only child."
1035,_TARUDANTE._,
1036,_TARUDANTE._,_SALA_ (_aside_).
1037,_TARUDANTE._,
1038,_TARUDANTE._,"And I must hear this spoken, and hold my peace."
1039,_TARUDANTE._,
1040,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ So now, prince Ferdinand, the chance of war"
1041,_TARUDANTE._,In making thee my captive gives me power
1042,_TARUDANTE._,To dictate terms which shall content us all.      570
1043,_TARUDANTE._,Thou shalt go free—that is my gift to thee:—
1044,_TARUDANTE._,"But in return for that,—my profit this,—"
1045,_TARUDANTE._,"I will have Ceuta; ’tis an ancient town,"
1046,_TARUDANTE._,"By name and people African, and held"
1047,_TARUDANTE._,By followers of the prophet from the day
1048,_TARUDANTE._,When truth unconquerable like a flood
1049,_TARUDANTE._,Of sunlight dawned on the benighted west.
1050,_TARUDANTE._,"Thy father robbed it from us, and I ask"
1051,_TARUDANTE._,"That thou restore it. ’Tis thy ransom, prince."
1052,_TARUDANTE._,"The king, thy brother, will not grudge to yield      580"
1053,_TARUDANTE._,"To me, a king, part of mine own, which he"
1054,_TARUDANTE._,"Wrongfully came by; if so, he may buy thee,"
1055,_TARUDANTE._,"His natural own, his flesh and blood, whom I"
1056,_TARUDANTE._,"Conquered in self-defence. I’ll keep thee here,"
1057,_TARUDANTE._,Till I may know his will: and to learn that
1058,_TARUDANTE._,"I’ll send thy brother home, the prince Enrique,"
1059,_TARUDANTE._,"To bear him, with what speed he may, the tidings"
1060,_TARUDANTE._,"Of thy defeat, captivity, and the terms"
1061,_TARUDANTE._,Of thy release. Look not so sorrowful.
1062,_TARUDANTE._,
1063,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ I thank your majesty for just rebuke      590
1064,_TARUDANTE._,Of my discourtesy. By selfish gloom
1065,_TARUDANTE._,"I mar my entertainment, and belie"
1066,_TARUDANTE._,My gratitude for kindness to me shewn
1067,_TARUDANTE._,Since I was prisoner.
1068,_TARUDANTE._,
1069,_TARUDANTE._,_K._                No thanks for that:
1070,_TARUDANTE._,Nor seek I to impose a countenance
1071,_TARUDANTE._,Upon thy proper feeling. Yet if now
1072,_TARUDANTE._,"Thou’rt sad, I spake in vain."
1073,_TARUDANTE._,
1074,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                      ’Tis for my fault
1075,_TARUDANTE._,"And ill-success I am sad—to have lost my troop,"
1076,_TARUDANTE._,Or led them to the fate of those whose rescue
1077,_TARUDANTE._,"They thought to be—not for my private case,      600"
1078,_TARUDANTE._,Wherein your terms of ransom but make hope
1079,_TARUDANTE._,Impossible: the cession of a town
1080,_TARUDANTE._,"Under the king’s protection, and therewith"
1081,_TARUDANTE._,"The peril of so many Christian souls,"
1082,_TARUDANTE._,"The desecration of our hallowed churches,"
1083,_TARUDANTE._,The abandonment of loyal loving subjects
1084,_TARUDANTE._,Unto the heavy yoke which Islam lays
1085,_TARUDANTE._,On true believers. No king would give ear
1086,_TARUDANTE._,To such a compact: and your claim falls short;
1087,_TARUDANTE._,For what you have urged doth not lay bare the root.
1088,_TARUDANTE._,"Ceuta is African, but not for that      611"
1089,_TARUDANTE._,Mahommedan: this thirsty continent
1090,_TARUDANTE._,Had drunk the truth for full four hundred years
1091,_TARUDANTE._,Before your prophet’s birth; and now we fight
1092,_TARUDANTE._,To win back from Mahommet what he took
1093,_TARUDANTE._,By force from Christ.
1094,_TARUDANTE._,
1095,_TARUDANTE._,_K._                What matters it to me
1096,_TARUDANTE._,What happened in the days of ignorance?
1097,_TARUDANTE._,"’Tis written in our book, that the whole world"
1098,_TARUDANTE._,Shall feel our sword.
1099,_TARUDANTE._,
1100,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._              ’Tis writ in ours, that they"
1101,_TARUDANTE._,"Who take the sword, shall perish by the sword."
1102,_TARUDANTE._,
1103,_TARUDANTE._,_K._ Surely ’twas truly spoken of yourselves.      621
1104,_TARUDANTE._,"Yet will I make no change, but my demand"
1105,_TARUDANTE._,Shall urge upon the king your brother; he
1106,_TARUDANTE._,Will thank me for it.
1107,_TARUDANTE._,
1108,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._               Now, my gracious master,"
1109,_TARUDANTE._,Let me befriend our foe. ’Tis four days since
1110,_TARUDANTE._,"I was his prisoner, and he set me free."
1111,_TARUDANTE._,This claim the prince most generously puts by;
1112,_TARUDANTE._,Let us not pass it over: let him too
1113,_TARUDANTE._,Go find another army: we meanwhile
1114,_TARUDANTE._,Have ample force to march against the town.      630
1115,_TARUDANTE._,
1116,_TARUDANTE._,_K._ And why should blood be spent where ink will serve?
1117,_TARUDANTE._,’Twere thankless answer to our good ally
1118,_TARUDANTE._,"To put fresh pains upon him, and not use"
1119,_TARUDANTE._,His full sufficient victory.
1120,_TARUDANTE._,
1121,_TARUDANTE._,"_Tar._                     My liege,"
1122,_TARUDANTE._,"I’ll serve thee as a son, and to that title"
1123,_TARUDANTE._,Would prove my fitness.
1124,_TARUDANTE._,
1125,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ (_aside_).      By thine absence prove it.
1126,_TARUDANTE._,
1127,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ And if thou, son, wouldst dally now with war,"
1128,_TARUDANTE._,"Rather than grasp the hours of peace and love,"
1129,_TARUDANTE._,What shall I think?
1130,_TARUDANTE._,
1131,_TARUDANTE._,_Tar._            That threat must stay me here.
1132,_TARUDANTE._,
1133,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ Ay, stay; and I will solve thy scruple thus,"
1134,_TARUDANTE._,Good Sala. By the laws of chivalry      641
1135,_TARUDANTE._,Thou wouldst do to thy foe as he to thee:
1136,_TARUDANTE._,"But Ferdinand is not thy prisoner,"
1137,_TARUDANTE._,"Nor can be spared: his brother, prince Enrique,"
1138,_TARUDANTE._,"Whom thou didst truly capture,—tho’my purpose"
1139,_TARUDANTE._,"Was to require his promise to return,—"
1140,_TARUDANTE._,Him will I give his freedom for thy sake:
1141,_TARUDANTE._,If he return he shall not be detained.
1142,_TARUDANTE._,
1143,_TARUDANTE._,_En._ I thank your majesty: but for my part
1144,_TARUDANTE._,"I am but a traveller, that took occasion      650"
1145,_TARUDANTE._,Of this adventure to inspect your land.
1146,_TARUDANTE._,I pray make me the hostage; I am content
1147,_TARUDANTE._,"With any treatment, might I come to see"
1148,_TARUDANTE._,"Your city of Fez, and from your southward folk"
1149,_TARUDANTE._,"Learn their opinion of the Libyan coast,"
1150,_TARUDANTE._,Which some aver is circled by one sea
1151,_TARUDANTE._,From where we stand to Suez.
1152,_TARUDANTE._,
1153,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._                       And so it were,"
1154,_TARUDANTE._,I care no more than doth a caterpillar:      658
1155,_TARUDANTE._,"What could that serve? If thou’rt a man of peace,"
1156,_TARUDANTE._,The fitter then for our ambassador.
1157,_TARUDANTE._,
1158,_TARUDANTE._,"_En._ ’Tis not for me to choose, and you may trust me"
1159,_TARUDANTE._,To urge the king to treat upon your terms.
1160,_TARUDANTE._,I carry them most gladly.
1161,_TARUDANTE._,
1162,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ (_to K._).       Now, I pray,"
1163,_TARUDANTE._,"Do as my brother begs: let him be hostage,"
1164,_TARUDANTE._,And make me messenger: I will return.
1165,_TARUDANTE._,
1166,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ Nay, nay. I doubt thee not: but ’tis my will"
1167,_TARUDANTE._,"Thee to keep, not thy brother."
1168,_TARUDANTE._,
1169,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                       Then, my Enrique,"
1170,_TARUDANTE._,I make appeal to thee. Urge not these terms
1171,_TARUDANTE._,"On Edward: tell him rather I am myself,"
1172,_TARUDANTE._,And could not live ashamed.      670
1173,_TARUDANTE._,
1174,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._                      I swear thou wrongst me,"
1175,_TARUDANTE._,And temptest me to use thee ill. No more.
1176,_TARUDANTE._,"Begone, Enrique; I shall look to thee"
1177,_TARUDANTE._,"For amicable settlement. Go therefore,"
1178,_TARUDANTE._,And tell thy king I hold your brother here
1179,_TARUDANTE._,"Till he surrender Ceuta. As for thee,"
1180,_TARUDANTE._,Prince Ferdinand; thy word shall be thy chain:
1181,_TARUDANTE._,"Give me but that, and thou shalt have the freedom"
1182,_TARUDANTE._,Of all this castle.
1183,_TARUDANTE._,
1184,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._            I give’t your majesty.
1185,_TARUDANTE._,
1186,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ ’Tis well: so all are suited. And thou, Enrique,"
1187,_TARUDANTE._,Make thy best speed.
1188,_TARUDANTE._,
1189,_TARUDANTE._,"_En._              I go, your majesty.      680"
1190,_TARUDANTE._,
1191,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ (_to E._). Thou know’st my mind.—
1192,_TARUDANTE._,
1193,_TARUDANTE._,_En._ (_to F._). In any case I will deliver thee.
1194,_TARUDANTE._,
1195,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ No words. Begone, I pray."
1196,_TARUDANTE._,
1197,_TARUDANTE._,_En._                        So fare you well.      [_Exit._
1198,_TARUDANTE._,
1199,_TARUDANTE._,"_K._ (_to T._). And now, Morocco, come within: I’ll show thee"
1200,_TARUDANTE._,Whatever preparation in thine honour
1201,_TARUDANTE._,"Is ordered; hoping it may so content thee,"
1202,_TARUDANTE._,That thou wilt reconsider of thy threat
1203,_TARUDANTE._,To leave us with the moon.
1204,_TARUDANTE._,
1205,_TARUDANTE._,"_Tar._                   What here I have seen,"
1206,_TARUDANTE._,"Might I not take it with me when I go,"
1207,_TARUDANTE._,Would hold me fast until the day of doom.      690
1208,_TARUDANTE._,
1209,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ (_aside_). And may the day of doom come ere thou take it!
1210,_TARUDANTE._,
1211,_TARUDANTE._,[_Exeunt K. and T._
1212,_TARUDANTE._,
1213,_TARUDANTE._,"(_To F._) Most generous prince, forgive me."
1214,_TARUDANTE._,
1215,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                                    I thank thee, Sala."
1216,_TARUDANTE._,
1217,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ I pressed the king so far as I may dare.
1218,_TARUDANTE._,"He hath a temper to resent advice,"
1219,_TARUDANTE._,"Which urged, will rather drive him from the matter"
1220,_TARUDANTE._,"It looks to favour, than assist him towards it."
1221,_TARUDANTE._,I must find other paths for my goodwill.
1222,_TARUDANTE._,Deem me thy servant: and o’erlook the wrong
1223,_TARUDANTE._,"I seem to have done thee, being again constrained"
1224,_TARUDANTE._,To fight against thee.
1225,_TARUDANTE._,
1226,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._               Say no more, my friend.      700"
1227,_TARUDANTE._,We serve our kings. Thou didst defeat our people
1228,_TARUDANTE._,"By numbers, merely numbers. I prithee tell me"
1229,_TARUDANTE._,The name of your princess.
1230,_TARUDANTE._,
1231,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                    Almeh.
1232,_TARUDANTE._,
1233,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                        Betrothed
1234,_TARUDANTE._,Already to the prince my conqueror?
1235,_TARUDANTE._,
1236,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ The thing is new. Thou know’st as much as I.
1237,_TARUDANTE._,
1238,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ The prince is fortunate.
1239,_TARUDANTE._,
1240,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                         So is the king
1241,_TARUDANTE._,In his alliance.
1242,_TARUDANTE._,
1243,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._         Is the marriage then
1244,_TARUDANTE._,Between the kingdoms rather than the parties?
1245,_TARUDANTE._,
1246,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ If ’twas your war that hath determined it.
1247,_TARUDANTE._,
1248,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ It were a strained ungentle consequence,      710"
1249,_TARUDANTE._,That I should sail from Portugal to force
1250,_TARUDANTE._,A lover on this lady’s inclination.
1251,_TARUDANTE._,
1252,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ I were like grieved.
1253,_TARUDANTE._,
1254,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                   Her beauty far exceeds
1255,_TARUDANTE._,All that I thought to find. In my own country
1256,_TARUDANTE._,Our court holds not her equal.
1257,_TARUDANTE._,
1258,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                        I believe it.
1259,_TARUDANTE._,
1260,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ And if her mind be as her speech, endowed...."
1261,_TARUDANTE._,
1262,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ Thou owest her so much praise for kindnesses
1263,_TARUDANTE._,Done to your prisoned countrymen.
1264,_TARUDANTE._,
1265,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                          Ah, Sala,"
1266,_TARUDANTE._,"Where be these captives kept? if thou wouldst help me,"
1267,_TARUDANTE._,I pray thee bring me in time where I may see them.
1268,_TARUDANTE._,I must speak with them.
1269,_TARUDANTE._,
1270,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._                 That is easy, prince.      721"
1271,_TARUDANTE._,"Behind these garden grounds is a deep pit,"
1272,_TARUDANTE._,Used as a quarry once; steep hanging sides
1273,_TARUDANTE._,"Of rock it hath, that hewn away below"
1274,_TARUDANTE._,Are inaccessible to any foot
1275,_TARUDANTE._,"Save the soft lizard, that hath made his home"
1276,_TARUDANTE._,"Among the clefts with scorpions and snakes,"
1277,_TARUDANTE._,And on the scorching ledges basks all day.
1278,_TARUDANTE._,’Tis there these Christians lie. One way there is
1279,_TARUDANTE._,"Climbing by solid steps of native stone,      730"
1280,_TARUDANTE._,That comes up to the ground. Between those rocks
1281,_TARUDANTE._,"Thou seest the iron gate, and by the gate"
1282,_TARUDANTE._,The sentinel that keeps it. I would guide thee
1283,_TARUDANTE._,To see thy countrymen; but there’s no need
1284,_TARUDANTE._,"To make the hard descent; for once a day,"
1285,_TARUDANTE._,"At prayer and pity of our good princess,"
1286,_TARUDANTE._,’Tis granted them to come and walk above
1287,_TARUDANTE._,"In shadow of yon balmy cypress grove,"
1288,_TARUDANTE._,"That skirts the northern brink: and but for this,"
1289,_TARUDANTE._,"Their sole refreshment, all were like to have died      740"
1290,_TARUDANTE._,"Of woe, and scant food, and the daily stroke"
1291,_TARUDANTE._,Shelterless of the hot meridian sun.
1292,_TARUDANTE._,
1293,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Alas!
1294,_TARUDANTE._,What fault of theirs deserved such punishment?
1295,_TARUDANTE._,
1296,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ That they refused confession of the prophet.
1297,_TARUDANTE._,
1298,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ To acknowledge him were to renounce their faith.
1299,_TARUDANTE._,That is no wrong.
1300,_TARUDANTE._,
1301,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._           Whether it be wrong or no,"
1302,_TARUDANTE._,’Tis not my will they undergo these pains.
1303,_TARUDANTE._,
1304,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ I pray thee lead me to them, if thou mayst."
1305,_TARUDANTE._,
1306,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._ Nay, bide thou here, I will throw back the gate,"
1307,_TARUDANTE._,And bid them forth: and for thy less constraint      750
1308,_TARUDANTE._,"Will then depart.      [_Goes to back, and exit._"
1309,_TARUDANTE._,
1310,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._          Such courtesy and cruelty in one
1311,_TARUDANTE._,"I never thought to have met, nor found on earth"
1312,_TARUDANTE._,"So fair a prison, with an angel in it,"
1313,_TARUDANTE._,And no hope of deliverance. Now I see
1314,_TARUDANTE._,Nature hath vainly lavished on these Moors
1315,_TARUDANTE._,Bravery and beauty and all gifts of pride;
1316,_TARUDANTE._,"And left them barbarous for lack of thee,"
1317,_TARUDANTE._,"Sweet Pity, of human sorrow born: ’tis thou"
1318,_TARUDANTE._,Dost raise man ’bove the brutes: ’tis thou dost make
1319,_TARUDANTE._,"His heart so singular, that he alone,      760"
1320,_TARUDANTE._,"Himself commiserating, against heaven"
1321,_TARUDANTE._,"Pushes complaint, and finds within his heart"
1322,_TARUDANTE._,"Room for all creatures, that like him are born"
1323,_TARUDANTE._,To suffer and perish.
1324,_TARUDANTE._,
1325,_TARUDANTE._,_Enter Captives from gate; they run to Ferdinand as they see him._
1326,_TARUDANTE._,
1327,_TARUDANTE._,"CHOR.     Hail, mighty Ferdinand!—"
1328,_TARUDANTE._,"Hail, generous prince!—Behold"
1329,_TARUDANTE._,Thy countrymen enslaved.—
1330,_TARUDANTE._,What hope? what hope? O say—
1331,_TARUDANTE._,"Arm of our fatherland,      770"
1332,_TARUDANTE._,What mercy may be told?—
1333,_TARUDANTE._,Com’st thou to set us free?—
1334,_TARUDANTE._,Are we already saved?—
1335,_TARUDANTE._,"Or is it true, the boast"
1336,_TARUDANTE._,"We hear, the triumph-song?—"
1337,_TARUDANTE._,"And art thou too as we,—"
1338,_TARUDANTE._,(O miserable day)—
1339,_TARUDANTE._,Faln into the enemy’s hand?—
1340,_TARUDANTE._,And com’st thou thus alone?
1341,_TARUDANTE._,"Thine army slain and lost,—      780"
1342,_TARUDANTE._,The cause of Christ o’erthrown.—
1343,_TARUDANTE._,What hope? what hope? O say.—
1344,_TARUDANTE._,
1345,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ My friends, the worst is true. Trust still in God."
1346,_TARUDANTE._,
1347,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ Alas! have all our prayers been made in vain?
1348,_TARUDANTE._,
1349,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Despair not yet.
1350,_TARUDANTE._,
1351,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._                 What hope then dost thou bring?
1352,_TARUDANTE._,
1353,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ I bring you courage, friends. I come to share"
1354,_TARUDANTE._,"Your prison, since I cannot set you free."
1355,_TARUDANTE._,
1356,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ Alas! thou too art captive. All is lost.—
1357,_TARUDANTE._,"But if thou share our prison, shall we share"
1358,_TARUDANTE._,"Thy ransom also, when thou goest free?      790"
1359,_TARUDANTE._,
1360,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ I have no ransom, friends, that ye could share."
1361,_TARUDANTE._,
1362,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ No ransom!
1363,_TARUDANTE._,
1364,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._         Nay, no ransom."
1365,_TARUDANTE._,
1366,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._                          Not for thee?
1367,_TARUDANTE._,
1368,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ But such a ransom as cannot be paid.
1369,_TARUDANTE._,
1370,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ So great?
1371,_TARUDANTE._,
1372,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._        Ay, even so great, that ye yourselves"
1373,_TARUDANTE._,Would not consent to share.
1374,_TARUDANTE._,
1375,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._                     Tell us the sum.
1376,_TARUDANTE._,
1377,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ ’Tis to surrender Ceuta to the Moor.
1378,_TARUDANTE._,Now are ye silent.
1379,_TARUDANTE._,
1380,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._            We are flesh and blood.
1381,_TARUDANTE._,
1382,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Say ye?
1383,_TARUDANTE._,
1384,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._        The stones of Ceuta cannot bleed,"
1385,_TARUDANTE._,The walls of Ceuta would not pine as we.
1386,_TARUDANTE._,
1387,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Then take them for example: be as they:      800
1388,_TARUDANTE._,"Lament not, pine not."
1389,_TARUDANTE._,
1390,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._               Rank we now as stones?
1391,_TARUDANTE._,
1392,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ Stones, but not Ceuta’s stones; they if they bled"
1393,_TARUDANTE._,Would spout heroic blood: royally therewith
1394,_TARUDANTE._,"Were they baptised, ere they might wear the cross."
1395,_TARUDANTE._,I was a babe then: but the nurse that rocked
1396,_TARUDANTE._,"My cradle sang it: How the youthful prince,"
1397,_TARUDANTE._,"Edward my brother, led the assault and fought"
1398,_TARUDANTE._,"With hundreds hand to hand: how in the ships,"
1399,_TARUDANTE._,"Watching the combat, the old king himself"
1400,_TARUDANTE._,"Could no more be restrained, but forth descending,"
1401,_TARUDANTE._,"For envy of the fight, with agèd hands      811"
1402,_TARUDANTE._,"Clambered upon the walls, and by his son"
1403,_TARUDANTE._,Dealt wary strokes of death: till o’er the heaps
1404,_TARUDANTE._,"Of his own slain, out of his robber nest"
1405,_TARUDANTE._,Sala ben Sala fled.
1406,_TARUDANTE._,
1407,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._             Long live the king!
1408,_TARUDANTE._,
1409,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Since that day hath the fame ceased? Hath not Ceuta
1410,_TARUDANTE._,"Been as Christ’s tourney, where the nations"
1411,_TARUDANTE._,Have clapped their hands to see a few brave knights
1412,_TARUDANTE._,"Hold Africa at bay, and in the field"
1413,_TARUDANTE._,Conquer whole armies of the unbelievers?      820
1414,_TARUDANTE._,
1415,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ Praised be God!
1416,_TARUDANTE._,
1417,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._              I made an oath to match
1418,_TARUDANTE._,My brother’s praise.
1419,_TARUDANTE._,
1420,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._              Alas! what fate withheld
1421,_TARUDANTE._,God’s favour from our arms?—We who set out
1422,_TARUDANTE._,"To do him honour, and to plant the cross"
1423,_TARUDANTE._,On Tangiers’. as it stands on Ceuta’s walls?—
1424,_TARUDANTE._,"The foe lay watching for us, like a lion"
1425,_TARUDANTE._,Descended from the mountains.
1426,_TARUDANTE._,
1427,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                      On that day
1428,_TARUDANTE._,"I led your battle; and when ye were taken,"
1429,_TARUDANTE._,I fled but to retrieve the day. I found
1430,_TARUDANTE._,"A second army; I sought out the foe,      830"
1431,_TARUDANTE._,"And overcame him: and the furious Sala,"
1432,_TARUDANTE._,"Faln in my hands, I feared not to set free"
1433,_TARUDANTE._,As herald of my triumph. I was here: I had come
1434,_TARUDANTE._,"Even to this castle, when behold, swarming"
1435,_TARUDANTE._,"Innumerable from the hills around,"
1436,_TARUDANTE._,The horsemen of Morocco!
1437,_TARUDANTE._,
1438,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._                  What of the army?
1439,_TARUDANTE._,
1440,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Led off in captive gangs to serve the Moor.
1441,_TARUDANTE._,
1442,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ Alas for us and them. Thou canst not save.
1443,_TARUDANTE._,"We are all enslavèd, all undone."
1444,_TARUDANTE._,
1445,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                         Be so,"
1446,_TARUDANTE._,"Tame, cagèd wills, the off-scourings of fortune,"
1447,_TARUDANTE._,Mere counters of disaster! I will not yield.      841
1448,_TARUDANTE._,
1449,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._ Yield, prince, for us, who left our homes so far"
1450,_TARUDANTE._,To serve under thy banner; whom thine arm
1451,_TARUDANTE._,"Hath led to slavery—O prince, set them free,"
1452,_TARUDANTE._,Whom thou hast bound.—Restore us. Pay the price.
1453,_TARUDANTE._,
1454,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Can ye forget?
1455,_TARUDANTE._,
1456,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._               Nay, we remember well"
1457,_TARUDANTE._,"Estremadura, we remember Tagus,"
1458,_TARUDANTE._,"The banks of Guadiana, and our homes"
1459,_TARUDANTE._,"Among the vineyards; Ezla we remember,"
1460,_TARUDANTE._,"Obidos and Alenquer, where the trees      850"
1461,_TARUDANTE._,"Shadow the village steps, and on the slopes"
1462,_TARUDANTE._,Our gardens bloom: where cold Montego laves
1463,_TARUDANTE._,The fertile valleys ’mong the hills of Beira:
1464,_TARUDANTE._,"Our country we remember, and the voices"
1465,_TARUDANTE._,"Of wives and children, by whose tears we pray,"
1466,_TARUDANTE._,"Despise us not. See on our knees we bow,"
1467,_TARUDANTE._,And by God’s love pray thee deliver us.
1468,_TARUDANTE._,
1469,_TARUDANTE._,[_They all kneel to Ferdinand._
1470,_TARUDANTE._,
1471,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ Ah, wretched rebels! hath a little hardship"
1472,_TARUDANTE._,Melted the metal from you? I see ye are dross
1473,_TARUDANTE._,Quite to the bottom. These hands that ye raise      860
1474,_TARUDANTE._,"Should have smote down the foe. Being as ye are,"
1475,_TARUDANTE._,How took ye upon you to defend the cross?
1476,_TARUDANTE._,Doth not the shame of capture and defeat
1477,_TARUDANTE._,"Suffice, but ye must kneel to beg the addition"
1478,_TARUDANTE._,"Of treason and betrayal, to deliver"
1479,_TARUDANTE._,Your worthless bodies from the pains that ye
1480,_TARUDANTE._,Have thousandfold deserved? My brethren are ye?
1481,_TARUDANTE._,"Nay, I’ll not look upon you.      [_Turns away._"
1482,_TARUDANTE._,
1483,_TARUDANTE._,_Re-enter Almeh and Zapel._
1484,_TARUDANTE._,
1485,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ Lo, what is this?"
1486,_TARUDANTE._,
1487,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._                 O gracious kind princess,"
1488,_TARUDANTE._,Plead for us now.
1489,_TARUDANTE._,
1490,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._           What would ye?
1491,_TARUDANTE._,
1492,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                        Noble lady,      870"
1493,_TARUDANTE._,I have a title to thy heart’s compassion
1494,_TARUDANTE._,"Greater than these my countrymen, whose woes"
1495,_TARUDANTE._,"Have moved thy spirit; and by that kindness in thee,"
1496,_TARUDANTE._,"As by that beauty,—may I use the name"
1497,_TARUDANTE._,"Of what I only worship,—I beseech thee"
1498,_TARUDANTE._,"Hear them not speak, lest thou misjudge me much."
1499,_TARUDANTE._,
1500,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ Rise, friends: ere I can help you, I must know"
1501,_TARUDANTE._,What boon ye sue for.
1502,_TARUDANTE._,
1503,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._              Not so: lest thou add
1504,_TARUDANTE._,"To theirs thy prayer, too strong to be denied."
1505,_TARUDANTE._,
1506,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._ What fear’st thou that my voice might win for them?      880
1507,_TARUDANTE._,
1508,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Ask not of them nor me.
1509,_TARUDANTE._,
1510,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._                        Thou must dissuade
1511,_TARUDANTE._,"My pity, or meet it where ’tis first engaged."
1512,_TARUDANTE._,
1513,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Then hear the truth from me. They vainly beg
1514,_TARUDANTE._,Their liberty.
1515,_TARUDANTE._,
1516,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._        From thee?
1517,_TARUDANTE._,
1518,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                 Ay, lady."
1519,_TARUDANTE._,
1520,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._                          How!
1521,_TARUDANTE._,For this I too was lately on my knees;
1522,_TARUDANTE._,But that was to the king. What power hast thou
1523,_TARUDANTE._,"To grant this; or, being able, why deniest?"
1524,_TARUDANTE._,
1525,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ They think at least that they would share my freedom,"
1526,_TARUDANTE._,If I went forth: wherefore they urge me do
1527,_TARUDANTE._,For them the thing I will not for myself.      890
1528,_TARUDANTE._,
1529,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._ And what is that?
1530,_TARUDANTE._,
1531,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                Thy father hath appointed
1532,_TARUDANTE._,"The town of Ceuta for my ransom, lady."
1533,_TARUDANTE._,
1534,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._ And that lies then within thy power to grant?
1535,_TARUDANTE._,
1536,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ So far as ’tis within the power of him
1537,_TARUDANTE._,Who scorns base actions to commit the basest.
1538,_TARUDANTE._,
1539,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ My sire, prince, hath a right and titled claim."
1540,_TARUDANTE._,
1541,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Christ hath erased all titles with his cross;
1542,_TARUDANTE._,And by that sign reclaims the world he made.
1543,_TARUDANTE._,
1544,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ I know, prince, thou art generous; for thou gavest"
1545,_TARUDANTE._,Life to thine enemy: and for that gift      900
1546,_TARUDANTE._,I am thy friend. ’Tis for thyself I plead.
1547,_TARUDANTE._,The king hath nothing nearer to his heart
1548,_TARUDANTE._,Than this possession: ’tis thy life’s condition.
1549,_TARUDANTE._,Yield where thou must.
1550,_TARUDANTE._,
1551,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._               I hold my life as nought.
1552,_TARUDANTE._,
1553,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._ Then, prince, tho’not for these, nor for thyself"
1554,_TARUDANTE._,"Thou wilt be bent, nor to my sire wilt yield;"
1555,_TARUDANTE._,Yet for the sake of holy peace submit;
1556,_TARUDANTE._,"For pity of all our people and thine own,"
1557,_TARUDANTE._,Whom pride will slay: think of the myriad wounds
1558,_TARUDANTE._,Softness may staunch; and how kings have no honour
1559,_TARUDANTE._,Above the keeping of their folk in peace.      911
1560,_TARUDANTE._,
1561,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Is’t in thy creed man shall buy peace of heaven
1562,_TARUDANTE._,By selling honour? O nay. Let the king
1563,_TARUDANTE._,"But take my life, and count my blood enough"
1564,_TARUDANTE._,To be one slave’s redemption; there were then
1565,_TARUDANTE._,"No cause to kneel. Yea, wouldst thou shew me kindness,"
1566,_TARUDANTE._,"Make this thy prayer. Go back unto thy sire,"
1567,_TARUDANTE._,"And sue that he will graciously, as the exchange"
1568,_TARUDANTE._,"For these men’s freedom, kill me, or in their pit"
1569,_TARUDANTE._,Bury me alive.
1570,_TARUDANTE._,
1571,_TARUDANTE._,"_Al._        Alas, alas!      920"
1572,_TARUDANTE._,
1573,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ If now my words in pleading for myself
1574,_TARUDANTE._,"Have hurt thee, lady, forgive them: nay, weep not."
1575,_TARUDANTE._,"Until I saw thy pity for my sake,"
1576,_TARUDANTE._,I had no woe to bear.
1577,_TARUDANTE._,
1578,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._               And woe it is
1579,_TARUDANTE._,"To see such suffering wrought by man on man,"
1580,_TARUDANTE._,And seek to heal it with a woman’s words.
1581,_TARUDANTE._,
1582,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ Lady, I need not pity: there’s no fortune"
1583,_TARUDANTE._,I have not heart for.
1584,_TARUDANTE._,
1585,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._               Now I see these men
1586,_TARUDANTE._,Have gentler hearts than thou: they gave me comfort
1587,_TARUDANTE._,Receiving my compassion; thou’rt too proud.      930
1588,_TARUDANTE._,
1589,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ For I was shamed seeing a woman weep
1590,_TARUDANTE._,Vainly for what I suffer without tears.
1591,_TARUDANTE._,
1592,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._ I too am bred to shows.—Prince: I was sent
1593,_TARUDANTE._,To fetch thee to the house. Attend the summons.
1594,_TARUDANTE._,"My father sits to dinner, and enquires"
1595,_TARUDANTE._,Wherefore thou tarriest. Of thy courtesy
1596,_TARUDANTE._,Play our good guest with freedom; for the king
1597,_TARUDANTE._,"Will use no more constraint, than as thy health"
1598,_TARUDANTE._,And princely state require.
1599,_TARUDANTE._,
1600,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                    I will obey thee.
1601,_TARUDANTE._,
1602,_TARUDANTE._,_Al._ And not my father?
1603,_TARUDANTE._,
1604,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                 Him, lady, perforce;      940"
1605,_TARUDANTE._,But thee most cheerfully. To thee no less
1606,_TARUDANTE._,Am I a captive.
1607,_TARUDANTE._,
1608,_TARUDANTE._,[_Exeunt Almeh and Ferdinand and Zapel._
1609,_TARUDANTE._,
1610,_TARUDANTE._,"CHORUS. (_The leader_ (1) _speaks, answered by others_.)"
1611,_TARUDANTE._,
1612,_TARUDANTE._,"Now see we hope, friends: God hath sent"
1613,_TARUDANTE._,His best and nearest messenger
1614,_TARUDANTE._,For our deliverance.—
1615,_TARUDANTE._,
1616,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._                Who is he?—
1617,_TARUDANTE._,
1618,_TARUDANTE._,"(1.) What, hast thou eyes, and couldst not see?—"
1619,_TARUDANTE._,
1620,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ If by thy hasty boast is meant
1621,_TARUDANTE._,The sudden love upsprung
1622,_TARUDANTE._,"Between Christ’s champion and the heathen maid,"
1623,_TARUDANTE._,’Tis withered on thy tongue.—      950
1624,_TARUDANTE._,
1625,_TARUDANTE._,"(1.) Heathen how call’st thou her,"
1626,_TARUDANTE._,"Our pitying angel who hath been,"
1627,_TARUDANTE._,And from our mouth the word of truth received?—
1628,_TARUDANTE._,
1629,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ Hath she believed?—
1630,_TARUDANTE._,
1631,_TARUDANTE._,"(1.) How shall not love persuade,"
1632,_TARUDANTE._,"Now fallen to water God’s own seed,"
1633,_TARUDANTE._,And in such soil?—
1634,_TARUDANTE._,
1635,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._             If she confess,"
1636,_TARUDANTE._,’Twill but the more our tyrant’s anger feed
1637,_TARUDANTE._,"With tenfold torture to oppress,"
1638,_TARUDANTE._,Or end us all at a stroke.—
1639,_TARUDANTE._,
1640,_TARUDANTE._,(1.)                       And so might be.      960
1641,_TARUDANTE._,But hark ye what I whisper. Mark. Ye see
1642,_TARUDANTE._,How in this garden one permitted hour
1643,_TARUDANTE._,Each day we wander free....
1644,_TARUDANTE._,
1645,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._ Ay, ay—an hour a day—what should this mean?—"
1646,_TARUDANTE._,
1647,_TARUDANTE._,"(1.) By their good help, secretly armed, I say...."
1648,_TARUDANTE._,
1649,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ What sayst thou? Armed!—go on.—
1650,_TARUDANTE._,
1651,_TARUDANTE._,(1.) How easy ’twere to find
1652,_TARUDANTE._,Occasion ...
1653,_TARUDANTE._,
1654,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._      When the foe is gone to fight
1655,_TARUDANTE._,Thou meanest?—
1656,_TARUDANTE._,
1657,_TARUDANTE._,"(1.)          Ay, thou’rt right...."
1658,_TARUDANTE._,
1659,_TARUDANTE._,_Ch._ And so to overpower      970
1660,_TARUDANTE._,The few men left behind.—
1661,_TARUDANTE._,
1662,_TARUDANTE._,(1.) See ye—
1663,_TARUDANTE._,
1664,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._       Ay, ay. Well done!"
1665,_TARUDANTE._,Convert our high-walled prison to a fortress strong—
1666,_TARUDANTE._,To Ceuta horse a courier—or all at night
1667,_TARUDANTE._,Make our escape by flight.—
1668,_TARUDANTE._,Each choosing a swift steed.—
1669,_TARUDANTE._,Better await until they send
1670,_TARUDANTE._,"A rescue.—Nay, how long"
1671,_TARUDANTE._,Could we sustain the fight?
1672,_TARUDANTE._,
1673,_TARUDANTE._,"(1.) Now tell me, was I wrong      980"
1674,_TARUDANTE._,Speaking of hope?
1675,_TARUDANTE._,
1676,_TARUDANTE._,"_Ch._           Nay, nay."
1677,_TARUDANTE._,We make thee leader.—Show the way
1678,_TARUDANTE._,To bring this soon about.
1679,_TARUDANTE._,
1680,_TARUDANTE._,(1.)                    Mark me. I say
1681,_TARUDANTE._,"This is no council-chamber, and I fear,"
1682,_TARUDANTE._,"Unless we now make end,"
1683,_TARUDANTE._,Joy will exalt our voices to betray
1684,_TARUDANTE._,"Our hope, ere ’tis well founded. Let us return"
1685,_TARUDANTE._,"Submissively to our pit, and as we go"
1686,_TARUDANTE._,"Sing a strain full of woe,"
1687,_TARUDANTE._,"That, reaching to the princess’ear,      990"
1688,_TARUDANTE._,"May work upon her, that she yearn"
1689,_TARUDANTE._,To set us free. With step and voice I lead.
1690,_TARUDANTE._,Follow.
1691,_TARUDANTE._,

1717,_ZAPEL._,
1718,_ZAPEL._,Here are thy lilies.
1719,_ZAPEL._,
1720,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                ’Tis enough of these;
1721,_ZAPEL._,"I thank thee, Zapel. Now there grows a flower"
1722,_ZAPEL._,"Wild 'neath the castle walls, a yellow rose"
1723,_ZAPEL._,"It seems, of stubborn habit, branching low;"
1724,_ZAPEL._,"When walking on the ramparts I have seen it,"
1725,_ZAPEL._,"And wondered whence it drew its sustenance,      1010"
1726,_ZAPEL._,In scattered tufts upon the waste sea sand;
1727,_ZAPEL._,"Go to the gate, and say I sent thee forth;"
1728,_ZAPEL._,"And pluck me blooms, and a young stem of it"
1729,_ZAPEL._,"That I may plant at home: if it should thrive,"

1734,_ZAPEL._,"Go where thou wilt, so thou return not soon."
1735,_ZAPEL._,Now is the hour prince Ferdinand should come:
1736,_ZAPEL._,Lovers would be alone.
1737,_ZAPEL._,
1738,_ZAPEL._,_Al._                Be sure of this;      1020
1739,_ZAPEL._,’Tis my sole comfort to be rid of thee;

1743,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._                If ’tis Fez,"

1746,_ZAPEL._,"The way to spoil thy fortunes, and dost shame"
1747,_ZAPEL._,The suit of a most high and worthy prince

1755,_ZAPEL._,"And if thou dost not love his flatteries,"

1757,_ZAPEL._,Where he must walk? that now these three days past
1758,_ZAPEL._,"At break of dawn, ere thou wast used to stir"
1759,_ZAPEL._,"Thou must go forth, because the moon is bright,"

1767,_ZAPEL._,Should I need thee to tell me?

1777,_ZAPEL._,

1788,_FERDINAND._,
1789,_FERDINAND._,_Al._                    Didst thou think
1790,_FERDINAND._,"I should play truant like an idle child,      1050"
1791,_FERDINAND._,"Who when the clock has struck cannot be found,"
1792,_FERDINAND._,And must be dragged to school?
1793,_FERDINAND._,
1794,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._                       O nay. But in this world,"
1795,_FERDINAND._,"Where all things move outside our reckoning,"
1796,_FERDINAND._,To find the least desire hath come to pass
1797,_FERDINAND._,Will seem a miracle.
1798,_FERDINAND._,
1799,_FERDINAND._,_Al._              What is thy desire?
1800,_FERDINAND._,What is the miracle?
1801,_FERDINAND._,
1802,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._             O beauteous Almeh!
1803,_FERDINAND._,If I might call thee Christian!

1805,_FERDINAND._,"_Al._                         Nay, I know not:"
1806,_FERDINAND._,But what I have learned makes me desire the name.
1807,_FERDINAND._,
1808,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._ Now is the purpose of my expedition
1809,_FERDINAND._,Revealed: for this I sailed to Africa:      1060
1810,_FERDINAND._,"For this I was defeated, and for this"
1811,_FERDINAND._,Brought captive here. ’Tis thou that art my prize.
1812,_FERDINAND._,
1813,_FERDINAND._,"_Al._ ’Twere a poor prize for so much war: but tell me,"

1815,_FERDINAND._,
1816,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                       Thou hast thought
1817,_FERDINAND._,My failure shames that title?
1818,_FERDINAND._,
1819,_FERDINAND._,"_Al._                       Nay, I ask"
1820,_FERDINAND._,"How, being a Christian, thou professest arms."
1821,_FERDINAND._,"Why hast thou come against us, with no plea"
1822,_FERDINAND._,"Save thy religion, and that happy gospel"
1823,_FERDINAND._,"Thou hast trampled on in coming, Peace on earth?"
1824,_FERDINAND._,
1825,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._ Too late to ask. When conscience, like an angel,      1070"
1826,_FERDINAND._,"Stood in the way to bar my setting forth,"
1827,_FERDINAND._,Zeal and ambition blinded me; tho’yet
1828,_FERDINAND._,Against the voice of them that urged me on
1829,_FERDINAND._,There lacked not prodigies of heaven to stay me.
1830,_FERDINAND._,"For as we sailed from Lisbon, all the host"
1831,_FERDINAND._,"That lined the shore with banners and gay music,"
1832,_FERDINAND._,Was changed before my eyes to funeral trains
1833,_FERDINAND._,"Of black and weeping mourners, who with wails"
1834,_FERDINAND._,And screams affrighted us. The sun in heaven
1835,_FERDINAND._,"Turned to blood-red, and doleful mists of grey      1080"
1836,_FERDINAND._,"Shut us in darkness, while the sucking ebb"
1837,_FERDINAND._,Dragged us to doom. And here now that I stand
1838,_FERDINAND._,"In the rebuke of judgment, I have no plea"
1839,_FERDINAND._,Save that I suffer: unless thou be found
1840,_FERDINAND._,My unsought prize.
1841,_FERDINAND._,
1842,_FERDINAND._,"_Al._            Thou missest the conclusion,"
1843,_FERDINAND._,"Considering but thyself, not those thou hast wronged."

1845,_FERDINAND._,To justice and to peace: my father’s honour.
1846,_FERDINAND._,"Thy duty towards thy wretched countrymen,"
1847,_FERDINAND._,And thine own freedom—      1090
1848,_FERDINAND._,
1849,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                Let no words between us
1850,_FERDINAND._,"Be spoke in vain, as these words now must be."
1851,_FERDINAND._,
1852,_FERDINAND._,"_Al._ Were thy words true, my words were not in vain."
1853,_FERDINAND._,

1856,_FERDINAND._,
1857,_FERDINAND._,_Al._ I hear the gate: some one comes forth. I pray

1874,_TARUDANTE._,Assure thyself: I need to see no more.
1875,_TARUDANTE._,

1886,_TARUDANTE._,
1887,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                     You have rather set us

1889,_TARUDANTE._,
1890,_TARUDANTE._,_Tar._             Speak not of that.
1891,_TARUDANTE._,
1892,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ Then mock not our repayment.      1110
1893,_TARUDANTE._,
1894,_TARUDANTE._,"_Tar._                           Look you, Sala;"
1895,_TARUDANTE._,"I understand to seize a prize by force,"
1896,_TARUDANTE._,"Or kindly take a gift, but not to sue."
1897,_TARUDANTE._,
1898,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._ Yet women must be wooed.
1899,_TARUDANTE._,
1900,_TARUDANTE._,"_Tar._                       Ay, that’s a game:"
1901,_TARUDANTE._,"But if ’tis more than play, I’ve no mind for it."
1902,_TARUDANTE._,"Patch up the matter as you can. For me,"
1903,_TARUDANTE._,I cry To horse.
1904,_TARUDANTE._,
1905,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._         Wait but a moment longer;
1906,_TARUDANTE._,"I will fetch Ferdinand. (_Aside._) To have two rivals,"
1907,_TARUDANTE._,"Tho’both be princes, may be better yet"
1908,_TARUDANTE._,Than to have only one.      [_Exit._
1909,_TARUDANTE._,
1910,_TARUDANTE._,"_Tar._ By heaven, they trifle with me, and by waiting"
1911,_TARUDANTE._,I allow it; cherishing an idle softness      1121
1912,_TARUDANTE._,"That fools me to take slights, yet cannot soothe"
1913,_TARUDANTE._,"My pride to competition. Nay, nor would I"
1914,_TARUDANTE._,"Rob grey-haired Sala of it, if he has dreamed"
1915,_TARUDANTE._,His heirs shall reign in Fez.... But the infidel—
1916,_TARUDANTE._,"How should the general countenance him,—altho’"
1917,_TARUDANTE._,There be some tie of chivalry between them?
1918,_TARUDANTE._,A riddle it is; a riddle I leave it. Now
1919,_TARUDANTE._,To save engagèd honour I must feign
1920,_TARUDANTE._,Some exigency. I will go warn my men      1130
1921,_TARUDANTE._,That they break camp at sunrise. In three days
1922,_TARUDANTE._,All is forgotten.      [_Exit._
1923,_TARUDANTE._,
1924,_TARUDANTE._,_Re-enter Sala with Ferdinand._
1925,_TARUDANTE._,
1926,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._          He is not here.
1927,_TARUDANTE._,
1928,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                         ’Tis well.
1929,_TARUDANTE._,
1930,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ What wouldst thou, Sala?"
1931,_TARUDANTE._,
1932,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._                         For thy safety, prince,"
1933,_TARUDANTE._,"And for my honour both, accept the terms,"
1934,_TARUDANTE._,And go hence while thou mayst.
1935,_TARUDANTE._,
1936,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                       Now spare thy words;
1937,_TARUDANTE._,For I am firm.
1938,_TARUDANTE._,
1939,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._        Then if thou close the door,"
1940,_TARUDANTE._,Thou must o’erleap the wall.
1941,_TARUDANTE._,
1942,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                     What mean’st thou?
1943,_TARUDANTE._,
1944,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                                         Fly.
1945,_TARUDANTE._,Feign sickness. I will let thee forth to-night.
1946,_TARUDANTE._,"Thou shalt be safe beyond pursuit to-morrow,      1139"
1947,_TARUDANTE._,While yet ’tis thought thou keep’st thy chamber.
1948,_TARUDANTE._,
1949,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                                         Nay.
1950,_TARUDANTE._,
1951,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._ As men will risk their lives to save their lives,"
1952,_TARUDANTE._,"Risk thou thine honour now to save thine honour,—"
1953,_TARUDANTE._,"Ay, and thy life. ’Tis looked for of no man"
1954,_TARUDANTE._,To make his tongue his executioner;
1955,_TARUDANTE._,"Nor any hath this right, to bind his brother"
1956,_TARUDANTE._,To die when it shall please him.
1957,_TARUDANTE._,
1958,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                         O honest Sala,"
1959,_TARUDANTE._,We wrong thee much in Spain: there art thou deemed
1960,_TARUDANTE._,A heartless soldier; not a bloody tale
1961,_TARUDANTE._,"That would pass current, but usurps thy name:"
1962,_TARUDANTE._,Men curse by thee.
1963,_TARUDANTE._,
1964,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._            I pray you now return,      1150"
1965,_TARUDANTE._,And disabuse your friends.
1966,_TARUDANTE._,
1967,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                   Ay, that and more"
1968,_TARUDANTE._,When I return.
1969,_TARUDANTE._,
1970,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._        Thou never wilt return,"
1971,_TARUDANTE._,Unless thou fly at once.
1972,_TARUDANTE._,
1973,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                 Tell me the worst.
1974,_TARUDANTE._,
1975,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._ What think you, should I slay you with these hands?"
1976,_TARUDANTE._,
1977,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._ Thou, Sala! why?"
1978,_TARUDANTE._,
1979,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                 I spake not empty words.
1980,_TARUDANTE._,
1981,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Their darkness is to me as emptiness.
1982,_TARUDANTE._,
1983,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._ By heaven, I would not now unseal my lips,"
1984,_TARUDANTE._,"But I know him I speak to, and my speech"
1985,_TARUDANTE._,"Shall win thee. Hark, I have been for twenty years"
1986,_TARUDANTE._,"Familiar with the king, one of his house;      1160"
1987,_TARUDANTE._,I have known the princess Almeh from her cradle:
1988,_TARUDANTE._,"Her father’s only child, she hath been to me"
1989,_TARUDANTE._,My single joy no less: from the first words
1990,_TARUDANTE._,"She lisped upon my knee, unto this day,"
1991,_TARUDANTE._,Her sayings and doings have been still the events
1992,_TARUDANTE._,"Which measured time to me: her childish ways,"
1993,_TARUDANTE._,"Her growth, well-being, happiness, were mine,"
1994,_TARUDANTE._,Part of my life. Whene’er I have been away
1995,_TARUDANTE._,"On distant service, the same couriers"
1996,_TARUDANTE._,"That carried my despatches to the king,      1170"
1997,_TARUDANTE._,"Returned to me with tidings of the child,"
1998,_TARUDANTE._,"Writ for my use, the careful chronicle"
1999,_TARUDANTE._,"Of prattle, with whatever pretty message"
2000,_TARUDANTE._,She had devised to send me: as she grew
2001,_TARUDANTE._,"I watched her, taught her, was her friend; and while"
2002,_TARUDANTE._,"I trod in blood, and heard the mortal gasp"
2003,_TARUDANTE._,"Of foes my scimitar struck down to hell,"
2004,_TARUDANTE._,I suffered nothing to approach my soul
2005,_TARUDANTE._,"But what might too be hers. Sala is stern,"
2006,_TARUDANTE._,"Men say, and register my actions bluntly      1180"
2007,_TARUDANTE._,"To common qualities,—I serve my age"
2008,_TARUDANTE._,"In such a tedious practice,—but in truth"
2009,_TARUDANTE._,Sala is gentle as the tend’rest plant
2010,_TARUDANTE._,"That noonday withers, or the night frosts pinch."
2011,_TARUDANTE._,"I tell thee what I would not dare tell any,"
2012,_TARUDANTE._,"Lest he should smile at me, and I should slay him:"
2013,_TARUDANTE._,"I tell it thee, knowing thou wilt not smile."
2014,_TARUDANTE._,Now late it happed that I returned to Fez
2015,_TARUDANTE._,After some longer absence than was wont;
2016,_TARUDANTE._,"And looking still to meet the child I left,      1190"
2017,_TARUDANTE._,I found her not. She had made a dizzy flight
2018,_TARUDANTE._,From prettiest to fairest. Slow-working time
2019,_TARUDANTE._,"Had leapt in a miracle: ere one could say,"
2020,_TARUDANTE._,"From being a child suddenly she was a woman,"
2021,_TARUDANTE._,"Changed beyond hope, to me past hope unchanged."
2022,_TARUDANTE._,"Maybe thou hast never tasted, prince, this sorrow,"
2023,_TARUDANTE._,When fortune smiling upon those we love
2024,_TARUDANTE._,Removes them from our reach—when we awake
2025,_TARUDANTE._,To our small reckoning in the circumstance
2026,_TARUDANTE._,We are grown to lean on.—Cursèd be the day      1200
2027,_TARUDANTE._,Whereon we met: or would thou hadst slain me there—
2028,_TARUDANTE._,My wrongs are worse than death.
2029,_TARUDANTE._,
2030,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                        How! can it be?
2031,_TARUDANTE._,"Tell me but truth. Art thou my rival, Sala?"
2032,_TARUDANTE._,Thou art: thou art. Yet ’twas thyself deceived me.
2033,_TARUDANTE._,Thou’st ever spoken of her as of a daughter.
2034,_TARUDANTE._,"Forgive me, Sala; thy familiarity"
2035,_TARUDANTE._,"And thy years blinded me. If, ere I came"
2036,_TARUDANTE._,"Her heart was thine, and I by pity’s softness"
2037,_TARUDANTE._,"Have stolen the passion that was thine before,"
2038,_TARUDANTE._,Now by mine honour I will do thy bidding:      1210
2039,_TARUDANTE._,"If ’tis the only way, I’ll fly to-night."
2040,_TARUDANTE._,"Thy word, and I will fly. Were ye betrothed?"
2041,_TARUDANTE._,
2042,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._ Nay, prince ..."
2043,_TARUDANTE._,
2044,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._              Nay?... Yet if not betrothed, maybe"
2045,_TARUDANTE._,"Almeh hath loved thee, shewn thee preference,"
2046,_TARUDANTE._,Some promise ...
2047,_TARUDANTE._,
2048,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._          Nay.
2049,_TARUDANTE._,
2050,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._              Then, Sala, in plain words,"
2051,_TARUDANTE._,How have I wronged thee? what can be the cause
2052,_TARUDANTE._,Why thou didst threat to kill me?
2053,_TARUDANTE._,
2054,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                           I said not that.
2055,_TARUDANTE._,
2056,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._ Esteem’st thou then a prince of Portugal
2057,_TARUDANTE._,So much less than Morocco? ...
2058,_TARUDANTE._,
2059,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._                        Dream’st thou the king
2060,_TARUDANTE._,Would wed his daughter to ...
2061,_TARUDANTE._,
2062,_TARUDANTE._,"_Fer._                      An infidel,      1220"
2063,_TARUDANTE._,Thou’dst say.
2064,_TARUDANTE._,
2065,_TARUDANTE._,_Sa._       Is’t not impossible?
2066,_TARUDANTE._,
2067,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._                         ’Twould seem
2068,_TARUDANTE._,No miracle to me shouldst thou thyself
2069,_TARUDANTE._,Turn Christian.
2070,_TARUDANTE._,
2071,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._         By Allah! Hush! here is the king. Begone,"
2072,_TARUDANTE._,Lest my goodwill to thee be more suspected
2073,_TARUDANTE._,Than it deserve.
2074,_TARUDANTE._,
2075,_TARUDANTE._,_Fer._         I’ll speak with thee again.      [_Exit._
2076,_TARUDANTE._,
2077,_TARUDANTE._,"_Sa._ (_solus_). I have shot my best bolt forth, and missed my aim."
2078,_TARUDANTE._,
2079,_TARUDANTE._,_Enter King._
2080,_TARUDANTE._,
2081,_KING._,_KING._
2082,_KING._,
2083,_KING._,"Sala, what dost thou here? I sent for thee."
2084,_KING._,
2085,_KING._,"_Sa._ No message, sire, hath reached me."
2086,_KING._,
2087,_KING._,_K._                                   I am come myself
2088,_KING._,"To find thee; I need thy counsel, and I desire"
2089,_KING._,"Thou wilt put off the manner of advisers,      1230"
2090,_KING._,Who affect disapprobation of whatever
2091,_KING._,Is done without their sanction; in which humour
2092,_KING._,Thou hast looked grudgingly upon the marriage
2093,_KING._,’Twixt Almeh and Morocco.
2094,_KING._,
2095,_KING._,_Sa._                   My dislike
2096,_KING._,Hath better ground.
2097,_KING._,
2098,_KING._,"_K._              Whate’er it be, I bid thee"
2099,_KING._,Put thy dislike aside: the business threatens
2100,_KING._,To fail without our aid.
2101,_KING._,
2102,_KING._,_Sa._                  How so?
2103,_KING._,
2104,_KING._,_K._                         The prince
2105,_KING._,Hath been with us five days: ’tis now full time
2106,_KING._,He spoke his mind; and yet he hath said no word.
2107,_KING._,
2108,_KING._,"_Sa._ Well, sire?                           1240"
2109,_KING._,
2110,_KING._,_K._            The cause: I’ll tell thee first my thoughts.
2111,_KING._,
2112,_KING._,_Sa._ The fancy of a maid is as the air—
2113,_KING._,"Light, uncontrollable."
2114,_KING._,
2115,_KING._,_K._                 What dream is this?
2116,_KING._,’Tis not her liking that I count. The day
2117,_KING._,That Tarudante asks her she is his:
2118,_KING._,’Tis that he doth not ask.—I have myself perceived
2119,_KING._,A melancholy habit that hath come
2120,_KING._,"Upon my daughter of late, and grows apace."
2121,_KING._,"I thought awhile ’twas love, but now I fear"
2122,_KING._,"’Tis a deep disaffection: such behaviour,"
2123,_KING._,"So foreign to her years, might well repel      1250"
2124,_KING._,So fine a lover.
2125,_KING._,
2126,_KING._,_Sa._          That is not the cause.
2127,_KING._,
2128,_KING._,_K._ I say it is. I have watched her with the prince
2129,_KING._,"Now for two days, and marked in her behaviour"
2130,_KING._,Indifference and abstraction.
2131,_KING._,
2132,_KING._,_Sa._                       And if ’tis so?
2133,_KING._,
2134,_KING._,_K._ Find some device to drive these humours off.
2135,_KING._,"Did I but know, could we discover, Sala,"
2136,_KING._,"What lies the nearest to her heart, a prompt"
2137,_KING._,And unforeseen indulgence would restore
2138,_KING._,Her spirit to cheerfulness.
2139,_KING._,
2140,_KING._,_Sa._ (_aside_).          Now here is hope.
2141,_KING._,If I could work him to my purpose now.      1260
2142,_KING._,
2143,_KING._,_K._ What say’st thou?
2144,_KING._,
2145,_KING._,"_Sa._                Sire, the sufferings of the captives"
2146,_KING._,"First hurt your daughter’s spirit. Would you heal it,"
2147,_KING._,Release them.
2148,_KING._,
2149,_KING._,_K._        Eh! Wellah! I think thou’rt right.
2150,_KING._,Twice hath she knelt before me for these men:
2151,_KING._,I had never thought of it.
2152,_KING._,
2153,_KING._,_Sa._ (_aside_).         Heaven give my tongue
2154,_KING._,Persuasion.
2155,_KING._,
2156,_KING._,"_K._      I’ll do it, Sala: ’tis worth the price."
2157,_KING._,
2158,_KING._,_Sa._ There is yet one captive whom you cannot free.
2159,_KING._,
2160,_KING._,_K._ Who’s he?
2161,_KING._,
2162,_KING._,_Sa._        The prince.
2163,_KING._,
2164,_KING._,_K._                   He counts not with the rest.
2165,_KING._,
2166,_KING._,"_Sa._ Nay, since his wrong and claim stand above all."
2167,_KING._,
2168,_KING._,"_K._ Thou art pleading for thyself, Sala: thou knowest"
2169,_KING._,I hold the prince for Ceuta.
2170,_KING._,
2171,_KING._,"_Sa._                      So, sire; for never      1271"
2172,_KING._,Will you hold Ceuta for the prince. You asked
2173,_KING._,"My advice: you have it. Where my honour weighed not,"
2174,_KING._,"Nor my long service finds me any favour,"
2175,_KING._,Suspect not I would use a lady’s tears:
2176,_KING._,"Tho’true it be, the grief that Almeh felt"
2177,_KING._,"Hath been tenfold increased, since the good prince"
2178,_KING._,Who gave me life was asked to buy his own.
2179,_KING._,
2180,_KING._,_K._ But if I free the rest and keep the prince?
2181,_KING._,
2182,_KING._,_Sa._ A stinted favour brings no gladness. Yet      1280
2183,_KING._,"You could not more, you cannot, nay you are pledged."
2184,_KING._,
2185,_KING._,"_K._ Hark, Sala: I care not if he live or die."
2186,_KING._,Did I not offer him his liberty
2187,_KING._,On a condition? Since to win Morocco
2188,_KING._,"Is to have Ceuta, I may change my terms,"
2189,_KING._,"And use him for that purpose, tho’it stand"
2190,_KING._,One remove from my object: and I see
2191,_KING._,"How I can make a bargain. Fetch my daughter,"
2192,_KING._,For the same day she marries Tarudante
2193,_KING._,The prince and all the captives shall be hers:      1290
2194,_KING._,And she shall know it. Send her hither.
2195,_KING._,
2196,_KING._,_Sa._                                 I go.
2197,_KING._,(_Aside._) Yet the condition mars the gift for all.
2198,_KING._,
2199,_KING._,[_Exit Sala._
2200,_KING._,
2201,_KING._,"_K._ Nay, he shall not dissuade me. ’Twas good counsel"
2202,_KING._,Slipped from him unawares; and tho’I swore
2203,_KING._,"To keep the prince till he surrendered Ceuta,"
2204,_KING._,"That oath turned ’gainst myself I will cast o’er,"
2205,_KING._,Making his liberty my tool; and what
2206,_KING._,Self-interest persuades I’ll do with grace.—
2207,_KING._,"That men are strong or weak, foolish or wise,"
2208,_KING._,"According to the judgment of their fellows,      1300"
2209,_KING._,Is doctrine for the multitude. For me
2210,_KING._,"I would possess my wisdom as my health,"
2211,_KING._,"In verity, not semblance."
2212,_KING._,
2213,_KING._,_Re-enter Almeh._
2214,_KING._,
2215,_KING._,_Al._ My father sent for me?
2216,_KING._,
2217,_KING._,"_K._                       Come hither, Almeh."
2218,_KING._,I have news for thee.
2219,_KING._,
2220,_KING._,_Al._               Good news?
2221,_KING._,
2222,_KING._,_K._                         Thou shalt say good.
2223,_KING._,Guess.
2224,_KING._,
2225,_KING._,_Al._  There hath something happened?
2226,_KING._,
2227,_KING._,_K._                                Something shall be.
2228,_KING._,
2229,_KING._,_Al._ Is it peace with Portugal?
2230,_KING._,
2231,_KING._,"_K._                           Nay, not so far."
2232,_KING._,
2233,_KING._,_Al._ Tell me.
2234,_KING._,
2235,_KING._,_K._         The Christian captives.
2236,_KING._,
2237,_KING._,_Al._                              Dare I guess
2238,_KING._,They may go free?
2239,_KING._,
2240,_KING._,_K._            ’Tis that.
2241,_KING._,
2242,_KING._,"_Al._                      O kindest father,"
2243,_KING._,"Thou healest my heart, that hath the chief enlargement"
2244,_KING._,"In this deliverance. If they know it not,      1311"
2245,_KING._,May I go tell them?
2246,_KING._,
2247,_KING._,_K._              Stay. There’s one condition.
2248,_KING._,It lies with thee to fix the day.
2249,_KING._,
2250,_KING._,_Al._                           With me?
2251,_KING._,I say to-day.
2252,_KING._,
2253,_KING._,_K._        Thou canst not say to-day.
2254,_KING._,
2255,_KING._,_Al._ How soon?
2256,_KING._,
2257,_KING._,_K._          ’Tis thus. I make their liberty
2258,_KING._,A gift to thee the day thou shalt be married
2259,_KING._,To Tarudante.
2260,_KING._,
2261,_KING._,_Al._       Ah!
2262,_KING._,
2263,_KING._,_K._          The smile that came
2264,_KING._,So quickly to thy face hath fled again.
2265,_KING._,Is the condition hard?
2266,_KING._,
2267,_KING._,_Al._                ’Tis like denial.
2268,_KING._,
2269,_KING._,_K._ Denial!
2270,_KING._,
2271,_KING._,"_Al._      To do the thing I never wished,      1320"
2272,_KING._,And if I wished lies not in me to do.
2273,_KING._,
2274,_KING._,"_K._ Thou dost not wish, sayst thou? It lies not in thee?"
2275,_KING._,
2276,_KING._,"_Al._ ’Tis true I do not wish this marriage, sire."
2277,_KING._,
2278,_KING._,"_K._ Well, well. To wish to leave thy home and me"
2279,_KING._,"Were undesired: but to obey my will,"
2280,_KING._,"To trust thy welfare to my guidance, girl;"
2281,_KING._,Not to oppose my dictates....
2282,_KING._,
2283,_KING._,"_Al._                       Truly, father,"
2284,_KING._,"I have found as little occasion to oppose,"
2285,_KING._,As I have power to stand against thy will.      1329
2286,_KING._,
2287,_KING._,"_K._ I know it, child: but for that hold thee to blame:"
2288,_KING._,Thou hast not wished: ’tis in thy power to wish.
2289,_KING._,Marriage thou dost not wish: but thou must wish
2290,_KING._,What is my will; which to make more thine own
2291,_KING._,I add this boon. Was’t not thy chief desire?
2292,_KING._,Dost thou not thank me?
2293,_KING._,
2294,_KING._,_Al._                 Alas....
2295,_KING._,
2296,_KING._,"_K._ ’Tis no small gift, the lives of fifty men."
2297,_KING._,
2298,_KING._,"_Al._ Tell me, sire; with the captives dost thou reckon"
2299,_KING._,Prince Ferdinand of Portugal?
2300,_KING._,
2301,_KING._,_K._                        I knew
2302,_KING._,"Thou wouldst ask this, and am content to grant it."
2303,_KING._,See how I yield. I will go fetch thy lover:      1340
2304,_KING._,Be ready to receive him: what thou dost
2305,_KING._,"Ruleth his happiness as well as mine,"
2306,_KING._,And theirs whose life I give thee. Await him here.
2307,_KING._,
2308,_KING._,[_Going._
2309,_KING._,
2310,_KING._,"_Al._ Stay, father, stay!"
2311,_KING._,
2312,_KING._,"_K._                    Well, child!"
2313,_KING._,
2314,_KING._,_Al._ (_aside_).                   It cannot be:
2315,_KING._,I dare not tell—
2316,_KING._,
2317,_KING._,_K._            What wouldst thou say?
2318,_KING._,
2319,_KING._,_Al._                                  I know not.
2320,_KING._,I have not well understood; not yet considered.
2321,_KING._,
2322,_KING._,_K._ What is there to consider?
2323,_KING._,
2324,_KING._,_Al._                         Dost thou promise
2325,_KING._,The Christian captives and prince Ferdinand
2326,_KING._,"Shall all, the day I am married, be set free?"
2327,_KING._,
2328,_KING._,_K._ I do.
2329,_KING._,
2330,_KING._,"_Al._    And if I marry not Morocco,      1350"
2331,_KING._,What is their fate?
2332,_KING._,
2333,_KING._,_K._              They die; unless the prince
2334,_KING._,Surrender Ceuta to me.
2335,_KING._,
2336,_KING._,"_Al._                O sire, the prince"
2337,_KING._,Spared Sala’s life: thou owest as much to him:
2338,_KING._,Thou mayst not kill him.
2339,_KING._,
2340,_KING._,"_K._                   See, if that’s a scruple,"
2341,_KING._,How thou mayst gratify thyself and Sala.
2342,_KING._,"I put this in thy power. Canst not thou thank me,"
2343,_KING._,And smile on Tarudante?
2344,_KING._,
2345,_KING._,"_Al._                 I thank thee, sire."
2346,_KING._,"If I seemed not to thank thee, ’twas the effect"
2347,_KING._,"Of suddenness, nothing but suddenness."
2348,_KING._,I am glad to do it.
2349,_KING._,
2350,_KING._,_K._              I knew thou wouldst be glad.      1360
2351,_KING._,I shall go fetch thy lover. I shall not grudge
2352,_KING._,These hogs for him.      [_Exit._
2353,_KING._,
2354,_KING._,"_Al._             Death, said he? He would slay him!"
2355,_KING._,"My gentlest prince! O bloody spirit of war,"
2356,_KING._,That hast no ear where any pitiful plea
2357,_KING._,"Might dare to knock.—Alas, my dismal blindness!"
2358,_KING._,"I am but as others are, selfish, O selfish,"
2359,_KING._,That thought myself in converse with the skies;
2360,_KING._,"So shamed, so small in spirit. What is my love,"
2361,_KING._,"My yesterday’s desire, but death to him?"
2362,_KING._,And what to me? What but an empty fancy      1370
2363,_KING._,Nursed against reason? which I cling to now
2364,_KING._,"In spite of duty. Duty ... Ah, I remember"
2365,_KING._,"I had a childish fondness for that name,"
2366,_KING._,"Dreamed I would serve God willingly. But now,"
2367,_KING._,"Now ’tis impossible.... Now if I serve,"
2368,_KING._,I do his bidding with unwilling will;
2369,_KING._,Yet must I do it.
2370,_KING._,
2371,_KING._,_Re-enter Ferdinand._
2372,_KING._,
2373,_KING._,"_Fer._ Princess, I come to beg.... Alas! thy sorrow"
2374,_KING._,Shews me a greater care.
2375,_KING._,
2376,_KING._,_Al._                  Nay; ask thy wish.
2377,_KING._,
2378,_KING._,"_Fer._ ’Tis changed to learn thy grief, and why that brightness,  1380"
2379,_KING._,"That shone to cheer my life, now clouds with rain."
2380,_KING._,
2381,_KING._,"_Al._ Each hath his private grief, prince: why should I"
2382,_KING._,"Be wondered at, or questioned of my tears?"
2383,_KING._,"Enough the world is sad, and I am sad."
2384,_KING._,
2385,_KING._,"_Fer._ A twofold error, lady: the world is gay,"
2386,_KING._,And thou art half its splendour. When I first
2387,_KING._,"Beheld thee in this earthly paradise,"
2388,_KING._,"What wondrous jewels, thought I, God hath strewn"
2389,_KING._,"About the world, which in our count of it"
2390,_KING._,"Stand out of reckoning, being unseen."
2391,_KING._,
2392,_KING._,_Al._                               And then      1390
2393,_KING._,"If I was light of spirit, I knew not why;"
2394,_KING._,"Now,—but thou speakest of some favour: tell me."
2395,_KING._,
2396,_KING._,"_Fer._ Since my request is guilty of my coming,—"
2397,_KING._,’Twas for my countrymen: to-day the gate
2398,_KING._,Hath not been opened to them.
2399,_KING._,
2400,_KING._,"_Al._                       I am happy, prince,"
2401,_KING._,Their woes are ended. Ere thou camest hither
2402,_KING._,The king was here; and in his kindest mood
2403,_KING._,Granted their liberty.
2404,_KING._,
2405,_KING._,"_Fer._               Thy prayers, lady,"
2406,_KING._,Must be the sweetest incense that from earth
2407,_KING._,Perfumes God’s mercy-seat: He bends to soften
2408,_KING._,The heart that thou beseechest.
2409,_KING._,
2410,_KING._,"_Al._                         Stay, ’tis thus.      1401"
2411,_KING._,They are given to me to grace my bridal.
2412,_KING._,
2413,_KING._,_Fer._                                 How!
2414,_KING._,Thy bridal?
2415,_KING._,
2416,_KING._,"_Al._     When I am married where thou knowest,"
2417,_KING._,The prisoners shall be mine.
2418,_KING._,
2419,_KING._,_Fer._                     And when thy bridal?
2420,_KING._,
2421,_KING._,"_Al._ Whene’er Morocco, that is come to woo me,"
2422,_KING._,Shall ask to wed me.
2423,_KING._,
2424,_KING._,"_Fer._             Lady, forbid me not."
2425,_KING._,It needs no skill to read thy sorrow now:
2426,_KING._,"For coldly speak’st thou, and with trembling tongue—"
2427,_KING._,
2428,_KING._,_Al._ What think’st thou then?
2429,_KING._,
2430,_KING._,"_Fer._                       Forgive me, if I am bold:"
2431,_KING._,Thou dost not love him thou art bid to wed.      1410
2432,_KING._,
2433,_KING._,"_Al._ That were my blame, since he is worthy of me."
2434,_KING._,
2435,_KING._,"_Fer._ Nay, ’tis not that: but if I have guessed the truth,"
2436,_KING._,"O if thou hast now consented, and wilt sell"
2437,_KING._,"Thyself for pity of these wretched men,"
2438,_KING._,Now I forbid the odious sacrifice.
2439,_KING._,Perchance thou thinkest that these many souls
2440,_KING._,"Against thy single welfare, must make up"
2441,_KING._,The greater stake. Not so; they’re mites and scraps
2442,_KING._,'Gainst thy immeasurable worth: a thousand
2443,_KING._,Would not complete the thousandth part of thee;
2444,_KING._,And were I where their base ill-natured wills      1421
2445,_KING._,"Obey me, thou shouldst tell them for thy slaves"
2446,_KING._,As hairs upon thy head. ’Twere heavy tidings
2447,_KING._,"That thou shouldst love Morocco, and being so far"
2448,_KING._,"Won to the faith, shouldst willingly renounce"
2449,_KING._,"Thy saintly liberty: but rather so,"
2450,_KING._,"Than that by one thou lov’st not, against thy will,"
2451,_KING._,Thou shouldst be harnessed 'neath the common yoke.
2452,_KING._,
2453,_KING._,"_Al._ My will is nothing, prince, and if Morocco"
2454,_KING._,"Already hath three wives, I shall rank first.      1430"
2455,_KING._,
2456,_KING._,_Fer._ Monstrous! Wilt thou stoop to such servile change?
2457,_KING._,
2458,_KING._,_Al._ Unwittingly thou speak’st against thyself.
2459,_KING._,
2460,_KING._,_Fer._ Alas! what words have injured me with thee?
2461,_KING._,
2462,_KING._,"_Al._ None: but thy fate is knit in one with theirs,"
2463,_KING._,Whose happiness thou bidst me now not weigh.
2464,_KING._,
2465,_KING._,_Fer._ On that day shall I too be given to thee?
2466,_KING._,
2467,_KING._,"_Al._ Betray me not, I pray."
2468,_KING._,
2469,_KING._,_Fer._                     O Mockery!
2470,_KING._,What hast thou done?
2471,_KING._,
2472,_KING._,_Al._              The best for thee.
2473,_KING._,
2474,_KING._,_Fer._                              For me!
2475,_KING._,O nay. And for thyself?
2476,_KING._,
2477,_KING._,_Al._                 Think not of me.      1439
2478,_KING._,
2479,_KING._,_Fer._ Not think of thee! My very thoughts of heaven
2480,_KING._,"Are thoughts of thee. ’Tis now so short a time,"
2481,_KING._,Nor have I on my part any desert
2482,_KING._,"To challenge favour at thy gracious hands,"
2483,_KING._,That I should dare to speak: nor any words
2484,_KING._,"That man hath e’er invented, to combine"
2485,_KING._,"In sentences that mock mortality,"
2486,_KING._,Are proud enough to tell thee; therefore—
2487,_KING._,"I say in plainest speech, Almeh, I love thee."
2488,_KING._,"For thy goodwill I thank thee: but my fate,"
2489,_KING._,"If thou dost love me not, or art another’s,—      1450"
2490,_KING._,"Life or death, misery and imprisonment,"
2491,_KING._,"Slavery or freedom, count as little with me,"
2492,_KING._,"As when I shall be dead, where I may lie."
2493,_KING._,"Say, if thou canst, thou lov’st me: and if not,"
2494,_KING._,"Thou shalt at least have heard, and I have told,"
2495,_KING._,My tale; how to prince Ferdinand of Portugal
2496,_KING._,Thou didst appear the only being on earth
2497,_KING._,Worth his devotion; that for thy possessing
2498,_KING._,"He would have given all else, to live with thee"
2499,_KING._,"As Christians use, in state of man and wife,      1460"
2500,_KING._,Which God hath blessed.
2501,_KING._,
2502,_KING._,"_Al._                 No more, I pray no more."
2503,_KING._,The graveyard ghosts are not so waste and dead
2504,_KING._,As is thy phantom picture.
2505,_KING._,
2506,_KING._,_Fer._                   Dost thou love me?
2507,_KING._,
2508,_KING._,"_Al._ Why ask me? Yet be this an hour of truth,"
2509,_KING._,"Tho’all time lie. I love thee, Ferdinand,"
2510,_KING._,"Even as thou lovest me; would be thy wife,"
2511,_KING._,To live alone with thee as Christians use.
2512,_KING._,
2513,_KING._,"_Fer._ Almeh! Weep not. Fear nothing, if thou art mine."
2514,_KING._,
2515,_KING._,_Al._ I am nought that is not thine: only thy hope
2516,_KING._,I cannot share.
2517,_KING._,
2518,_KING._,_Fer._        How canst thou love and fear?      1470
2519,_KING._,"See, I can teach thee how to trust in love"
2520,_KING._,Now with this kiss.
2521,_KING._,
2522,_KING._,"_Re-enter King, Tarudante, and Sala._"
2523,_KING._,
2524,_KING._,_Al._ (_seeing K._). Away! My father! my father!
2525,_KING._,
2526,_KING._,_K._ What see I?
2527,_KING._,
2528,_KING._,_Sa._ (_aside_). Now could I slay him.
2529,_KING._,
2530,_KING._,_K._ (_to Tar._).                    These white-faced Christians
2531,_KING._,"Have most uncultured manners. (_To F._) By my soul,"
2532,_KING._,"Prince Ferdinand, thou usest thy liberty"
2533,_KING._,"With small restraint. (_To S._) Sala, conduct the prince"
2534,_KING._,Into the dungeon tower: see him there locked.
2535,_KING._,
2536,_KING._,_Tar._ (_aside_). ’Tis as I thought.
2537,_KING._,
2538,_KING._,"_K._                               Begone, I say: my passion"
2539,_KING._,Brooks not his presence.      [_Exit Sala with Ferdinand._
2540,_KING._,
2541,_KING._,"_Tar._ (_aside_).      But what word for her,"
2542,_KING._,The greater culprit?
2543,_KING._,
2544,_KING._,"_K._ (_to Al._).     As for thee, my daughter,      1480"
2545,_KING._,Retire thou too. Thy blush cannot be cured
2546,_KING._,"But by this felon’s punishment. Moreover,"
2547,_KING._,Thou dost not well to walk even in these grounds
2548,_KING._,Unveiled without attendant.      [_Exit Almeh._
2549,_KING._,
2550,_KING._,"_Tar._ (_aside_).           ’Tis well said,"
2551,_KING._,"Without attendant. (_To K._) With us, your majesty,"
2552,_KING._,The women all go veiled.
2553,_KING._,
2554,_KING._,_K._                   And so with us
2555,_KING._,"The custom is approved, and general."
2556,_KING._,But license hath been granted to my daughter
2557,_KING._,"And her attendants, when within the walls."
2558,_KING._,Nor wilt thou find her modesty is touched      1490
2559,_KING._,"By such concession. As for Ferdinand,"
2560,_KING._,Thou shalt decree his punishment.
2561,_KING._,
2562,_KING._,"_Tar._                          Nay, sire;"
2563,_KING._,I shall not ask that. I have here a letter
2564,_KING._,"Writ by my father, urging my return:"
2565,_KING._,He needs my troops. I look for your permission
2566,_KING._,To take my leave to-night. As for the matter
2567,_KING._,"Which brought me here, the services already"
2568,_KING._,Rendered your majesty have given me
2569,_KING._,"Much pleasure, as the recital will my father,"
2570,_KING._,And should confirm our friendship. I confess      1500
2571,_KING._,’Tis disappointment to me that the league
2572,_KING._,"Cannot be knit by marriage, and to have seen"
2573,_KING._,The princess hath much sharpened my regret.
2574,_KING._,"Could she have loved me, I had held myself"
2575,_KING._,Not so unworthy of her grace.
2576,_KING._,
2577,_KING._,"_K._                        Stay, stay."
2578,_KING._,Pray misinterpret not this fool’s presumption
2579,_KING._,As her consent.
2580,_KING._,
2581,_KING._,_Tar._        O nay.
2582,_KING._,
2583,_KING._,_K._               I see thou’rt wronged.
2584,_KING._,I bear thee no ill-will for thy resentment:
2585,_KING._,I should feel shame for thee wert thou not shamed:
2586,_KING._,But all shall be atoned for: the unbeliever      1510
2587,_KING._,Shall pay full penalty. Thou shalt decree it.
2588,_KING._,
2589,_KING._,"_Tar._ Might that rest with me, I’d be quit of him;"
2590,_KING._,"Deal courteously, and send him home to Spain"
2591,_KING._,To wive among his kin.
2592,_KING._,
2593,_KING._,_K._                 Be not so hasty.
2594,_KING._,Make not so much of this. I promise thee
2595,_KING._,"All shall be well. Stay, prince, and Ferdinand"
2596,_KING._,Shall lose his head this very day.
2597,_KING._,
2598,_KING._,_Tar._                           Your majesty
2599,_KING._,Mistakes me; I cannot sue. My troops are warned.
2600,_KING._,
2601,_KING._,"_K._ Cannot I stay thee? Now, by God, ill done."
2602,_KING._,"I am wronged, wronged.      1520"
2603,_KING._,
2604,_KING._,"_Tar._               Farewell, sire: in such a soreness"
2605,_KING._,Few words are wisest. What Allah forbids
2606,_KING._,Must be renounced. ’Tis of necessity
2607,_KING._,"I now depart. Yet should you need me again,"
2608,_KING._,"Send, and I come. God’s peace be with you.      [_Exit._"
2609,_KING._,
2610,_KING._,_K._                                     He is gone—
2611,_KING._,Incredible! Consenting: I could not gloss it:
2612,_KING._,"Before my eyes, the eyes of Africa."
2613,_KING._,Is this her secret? this her melancholy
2614,_KING._,That cannot love? Treachery and apostasy!      1528
2615,_KING._,"Or that sick passion is it, which some have suffered"
2616,_KING._,For things strange and detestable. I will see her:
2617,_KING._,She shall renounce it.—Hola! (_Calling._) Ho! within—
2618,_KING._,"No cure but that: immediate disavowal,"
2619,_KING._,"Ere ’tis too late. O shame! (_Calls._) Ho there, within!"
2620,_KING._,
2621,_KING._,_Enter Servant._
2622,_KING._,
2623,_KING._,(_To servant._) Give word that the princess attend me here.
2624,_KING._,[_Exit servant._
2625,_KING._,That devil knows; he looked as if he knew.
2626,_KING._,And Sala knew it. ’Twas for this he urged
2627,_KING._,The villain’s liberty. He shall go free....
2628,_KING._,To hell ... and I will grant such liberty
2629,_KING._,To all who have seen him. There’s one hiding-place
2630,_KING._,"Where I may stow dishonour. But for her,      1540"
2631,_KING._,My daughter; if yet perchance there is any spot
2632,_KING._,In all her heart untainted by this shame
2633,_KING._,"Which I may reach, that natural piety"
2634,_KING._,"May feel my yearning sorrow.... Tenderly,"
2635,_KING._,
2636,_KING._,_Re-enter Almeh._
2637,_KING._,
2638,_KING._,"Tenderly must I work. Lo, where she comes,"
2639,_KING._,Her shameful head bowed down with consciousness.
2640,_KING._,"Come, Almeh, come; come nearer. See:"
2641,_KING._,"Thy tender grace, thy beauty’s perfect flower,"
2642,_KING._,"The vesture of thy being; all thy motions,"
2643,_KING._,"Thoughts, and imaginations, thy desires,      1550"
2644,_KING._,"Fancies, and dreams; whate’er from day to day"
2645,_KING._,"Thou art, and callst thyself, what is it all"
2646,_KING._,"But part of me? Art thou the beauteous branch,"
2647,_KING._,I am the gnarlèd trunk that bore and bears thee;
2648,_KING._,The root that feeds. I call thee not to judgment;
2649,_KING._,"Only to save what most I prize, thy name,"
2650,_KING._,And mine: there’s one way that can be: Morocco
2651,_KING._,Hath taken his leave: before he leave must thou
2652,_KING._,"Beg him to see thy injury avenged,"
2653,_KING._,And for thine honour’s sake must on thy knees      1560
2654,_KING._,Bid me revenge it. If on the same day
2655,_KING._,"The Christian prince insulted thee he die,"
2656,_KING._,"And die at thy request, before the eyes"
2657,_KING._,"That saw thy shame, ere busy tongues can tell"
2658,_KING._,"A tale in the ear, such speedy penalty"
2659,_KING._,"Will fright the scandal to a tale of terror,"
2660,_KING._,"And save our name. Withal he is a prince,"
2661,_KING._,And that a prince should die may well atone.
2662,_KING._,"What sayst thou, child?"
2663,_KING._,
2664,_KING._,_Al._                 Bid me not speak.
2665,_KING._,
2666,_KING._,_K._                                  Thy tears
2667,_KING._,And sobs I cannot read. I bid thee speak.      1570
2668,_KING._,
2669,_KING._,_Al._ O father!
2670,_KING._,
2671,_KING._,_K._          Speak!
2672,_KING._,
2673,_KING._,"_Al._              Thy words, recall thy words."
2674,_KING._,
2675,_KING._,_K._ What words?
2676,_KING._,
2677,_KING._,_Al._          Thy words of blood.
2678,_KING._,
2679,_KING._,"_K._                             Ah, Almeh! Almeh!"
2680,_KING._,Art thou my daughter?
2681,_KING._,
2682,_KING._,"_Al._               O sire, on my knees"
2683,_KING._,I beg.
2684,_KING._,
2685,_KING._,"_K._   Well, what?"
2686,_KING._,
2687,_KING._,_Al._            His life! his life!
2688,_KING._,
2689,_KING._,"_K._                               Ah, traitress."
2690,_KING._,
2691,_KING._,"_Al._ Was not thy first condition hard enough,"
2692,_KING._,To save prince Ferdinand that I should marry
2693,_KING._,Another? and I consented: but when now
2694,_KING._,Thou knowest I love him....
2695,_KING._,
2696,_KING._,_K._                      Love him. Thou confessest!
2697,_KING._,
2698,_KING._,_Al._ I hid it from thee but to save his life;
2699,_KING._,"Now I avow it to save him. If thou’rt wronged,      1580"
2700,_KING._,’Tis I have wronged thee: so if one must die
2701,_KING._,Let it be me.
2702,_KING._,
2703,_KING._,_K._        Then perish all of us.
2704,_KING._,
2705,_KING._,"_Al._ Nay, why, when peace hath such a simple way,"
2706,_KING._,When kindness would cure all? If thou wouldst see
2707,_KING._,"How noble he is, how true...."
2708,_KING._,
2709,_KING._,_K._                        Silence! speak not
2710,_KING._,"What thou hast dared to think, lest I should curse thee."
2711,_KING._,I in my house to see God’s holy laws
2712,_KING._,Reversed; my blood contaminate abroad
2713,_KING._,With infidels! Fly quickly. What thou hast said
2714,_KING._,Will keep thee prisoned till thy heart is changed.
2715,_KING._,Go to thy chamber. I will send thee soon      1591
2716,_KING._,"Physic to cure thee. From my sight! Away,"
2717,_KING._,"Traitress, apostate."
2718,_KING._,
2719,_KING._,"_Al._              O father, by thy love...."
2720,_KING._,
2721,_KING._,_K._ Away! away!
2722,_KING._,
2723,_KING._,_Al._          By all God’s pity I pray thee:
2724,_KING._,For pity of me.
2725,_KING._,
2726,_KING._,"_K._          Begone, lest I should strike thee."
2727,_KING._,
2728,_KING._,"_Al._ Strike me, and I will bear it. I did the wrong."
2729,_KING._,"Punish me and pardon. I only ask for him,"
2730,_KING._,Take not his life.
2731,_KING._,
2732,_KING._,"_K._             The more thou pleadest for him,"
2733,_KING._,The more I hate him.
2734,_KING._,
2735,_KING._,_Al._              Heaven will soften thee.
2736,_KING._,Thou must relent. Thou wilt not slay us both.      1600
2737,_KING._,
2738,_KING._,"_K._ Begone, I say.      [_Exit Almeh._"
2739,_KING._,May all the plagues of hell
2740,_KING._,Torture these Christians evermore. I see
2741,_KING._,No safe revenge. Kill him? and the worst believed?
2742,_KING._,And he my hope of Ceuta? I cannot kill him.
2743,_KING._,It needs considerate action. Hola there.      (_Calling._)
2744,_KING._,"I’ll speak with Sala. Hola there, hola!"
2745,_KING._,
2746,_KING._,_Enter Servant._
2747,_KING._,
2748,_KING._,Bid Sala attend me here.      [_Exit servant._
2749,_KING._,"And if he blame me,"
2750,_KING._,"Because I harked not to him at the first,"
2751,_KING._,"He will not thwart my resolution now,"
2752,_KING._,When policy and revenge are bound together.      1610
2753,_KING._,"’Tis changed. The Christian now hath done a wrong,"
2754,_KING._,For which his death is due: I have my plan:
2755,_KING._,I’ll starve him till he yield. I’ll force him to it
2756,_KING._,By chains and torture till his stubborn pride
2757,_KING._,Pay down his ransom humbly.
2758,_KING._,
2759,_KING._,_Re-enter Sala._
2760,_KING._,
2761,_KING._,_Sa._                     Peace be with you.
2762,_KING._,
2763,_KING._,_K._ The devil take thy mocking salutation.
2764,_KING._,I have three matters for thee: attend. The first
2765,_KING._,"Is that Morocco leaves us, and with him"
2766,_KING._,Our army is gone; whereon the second follows:
2767,_KING._,Thou must send forth with speed to all the towns
2768,_KING._,"To levy succours; and thy forces here,      1621"
2769,_KING._,"Disordered in the war, visit thyself,"
2770,_KING._,"Reform, and make report. The third is this,"
2771,_KING._,"My will concerning Ferdinand,—and let that"
2772,_KING._,Be first in thine attention;—’tis his death.
2773,_KING._,"My hospitality which he hath wronged,"
2774,_KING._,I now withhold ... to death—thou understandest?
2775,_KING._,"And more, ’tis death to any that shall give him"
2776,_KING._,A crust or drop of water: and I will change
2777,_KING._,His entertainment. Set him in the stables      1630
2778,_KING._,To serve the grooms: put chains upon his feet:
2779,_KING._,"Appoint a guard to enforce his tasks, and make"
2780,_KING._,Mouleh their serjeant. For the execution
2781,_KING._,I hold thee liable. Let not his life
2782,_KING._,"Outdrag three days. But hark: in spite of vengeance,"
2783,_KING._,"And in remembrance of his claim on thee,"
2784,_KING._,"He may go quit upon the old condition,"
2785,_KING._,"Ceuta:—thou understandest? Go tell him this,"
2786,_KING._,"The only hope my clemency allows,"
2787,_KING._,But of my provocation not a word.      1640
2788,_KING._,Be thou in time prepared to clear thyself
2789,_KING._,Of having known this mischief and concealed it.
2790,_KING._,
2791,_KING._,_Sa._ My liege....
2792,_KING._,
2793,_KING._,_K._             Begone and do my will. Thy words
2794,_KING._,Save to persuade the prince. Speak not to me.
2795,_KING._,It angers me to see thee. Go. I have done.
2796,_KING._,
2797,_KING._,[_Exit Sala._
2798,_KING._,
2799,_KING._,"Three days I said; three days. Within that time,"

2813,_ZAPEL._,_ZAPEL._
2814,_ZAPEL._,
2815,_ZAPEL._,There’s none of good to tell.
2816,_ZAPEL._,She hath neither ate nor slept.
2817,_ZAPEL._,
2818,_ZAPEL._,_Sa._                         Will she not eat?      1650
2819,_ZAPEL._,
2820,_ZAPEL._,_Za._ Nothing.
2821,_ZAPEL._,

2823,_ZAPEL._,
2824,_ZAPEL._,_Za._                          Nor will she sleep.
2825,_ZAPEL._,"She fights ’gainst sleep, as if ’twere death. Like one"
2826,_ZAPEL._,"That must keep watch against its soft approaches,"
2827,_ZAPEL._,Sitting upon her couch with head inclined

2830,_ZAPEL._,"Her own distress, and squander their laments"
2831,_ZAPEL._,"Upon an unknown sorrow, which she says"
2832,_ZAPEL._,Enwraps the world. Or sometimes she will sing
2833,_ZAPEL._,The melancholy strains which she hath heard      1660

2839,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._    And ever, when I have tried to cheer her,"
2840,_ZAPEL._,"Hath she rebuked me, as she is wont; but gently,"
2841,_ZAPEL._,And bid me leave her: Then to meet her humour
2842,_ZAPEL._,"I have gone, but made occasion to return,"
2843,_ZAPEL._,"Bringing such simple food as best she likes,"
2844,_ZAPEL._,Freshly prepared to tempt her; and with tears
2845,_ZAPEL._,"I pray her but to taste: yet she endures,"
2846,_ZAPEL._,"And saith, 'I thank thee, Zapel: tho’I eat not,"
2847,_ZAPEL._,Thy skill is not misspent stretching the rack      1670
2848,_ZAPEL._,"That proves my constancy. I prithee, girl,"
2849,_ZAPEL._,Set fresh and fresh before me.’Hearing this
2850,_ZAPEL._,"I weep for pity: but she saith, 'Be sure"

2852,_ZAPEL._,Who is now denied.’
2853,_ZAPEL._,
2854,_ZAPEL._,_Sa._             Doth she not speak his name?
2855,_ZAPEL._,
2856,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._ Rarely and reverently, as a name of God."
2857,_ZAPEL._,Then I am sent to learn the last; if yet
2858,_ZAPEL._,"He lives, and whether he hath spoke of her. This morn,"
2859,_ZAPEL._,"As I returned from such unhappy quest,"
2860,_ZAPEL._,"She gave me this: See, ’tis a letter for him....      1680"
2861,_ZAPEL._,
2862,_ZAPEL._,[_Shewing letter._

2867,_ZAPEL._,"Kneeling and clasping me about the knees,"
2868,_ZAPEL._,Went to my heart. But now I have it I fear
2869,_ZAPEL._,To have broke the king’s command. I prithee take it.
2870,_ZAPEL._,
2871,_ZAPEL._,_Sa._ Give’t me.      [_Takes._
2872,_ZAPEL._,
2873,_ZAPEL._,"_Za._          To see her thus, Allah forgive me,"
2874,_ZAPEL._,I wish well to the infidel. What word
2875,_ZAPEL._,Shall I take back?
2876,_ZAPEL._,
2877,_ZAPEL._,_Sa._            Say truth. I will deliver it.
2878,_ZAPEL._,And tell her prince Enrique is returned:
2879,_ZAPEL._,"He is camped a league away, and in such force"
2880,_ZAPEL._,As makes me hope I may persuade the king      1690
2881,_ZAPEL._,"To yield to his demand. Since there’s this hope,"
2882,_ZAPEL._,"Bid her preserve her strength bravely, nor thus"
2883,_ZAPEL._,Prejudge God’s will. His blessing aid thy words.
2884,_ZAPEL._,
2885,_ZAPEL._,[_Exit Zapel._
2886,_ZAPEL._,
2887,_ZAPEL._,"I said there’s hope. ’Twas hope that bade me lie,"
2888,_ZAPEL._,"For none I see. And this is misery,"
2889,_ZAPEL._,"To cherish consolations, and be happy"
2890,_ZAPEL._,Doing the loathèd thing. Am I content
2891,_ZAPEL._,To bear a letter of Almeh’s to her lover?

2893,_ZAPEL._,"To save her,—my one hope that the prince should yield:"
2894,_ZAPEL._,And no persuasion but her love will move him.
2895,_ZAPEL._,This letter will entreat him; I must carry it.

2900,_KING._,
2901,_KING._,"Sala, make haste: a herald from Enrique."
2902,_KING._,This to me: Read. Edward of Portugal
2903,_KING._,"Is dead. His eldest son being but a babe,"
2904,_KING._,"A regency now governs, and the rulers"
2905,_KING._,Are prince Enrique and this Ferdinand.
2906,_KING._,"The other I cannot read, and ’tis addressed"
2907,_KING._,To Ferdinand. I doubt not that it urges
2908,_KING._,Acceptance of my terms and quick return.      1710
2909,_KING._,
2910,_KING._,"_Sa._ I pray it be so. Is it your pleasure, sire,"
2911,_KING._,To speak with Ferdinand?
2912,_KING._,
2913,_KING._,"_K._                   Ay, fetch him hither."
2914,_KING._,The dog being master now may change his mind.
2915,_KING._,
2916,_KING._,_Sa._ And will you see him in his shameful dress?
2917,_KING._,
2918,_KING._,"_K._ Nay, that is past:—his own, and with his sword."
2919,_KING._,
2920,_KING._,_Sa._ And his despatch; shall I not bear it to him?
2921,_KING._,
2922,_KING._,_K._ Ay. Give it him; take it. Stay. (_Aside._) I never know
2923,_KING._,What it may say. Better to try him first
2924,_KING._,Without its knowledge. Should I fail ’twere time
2925,_KING._,To use it then. (_To Sala._) Give it me. I’ll keep it back.
2926,_KING._,What is this other paper?      [_Seeing A.'s letter._
2927,_KING._,
2928,_KING._,"_Sa._                   I pray, my liege,      1721"

2930,_KING._,
2931,_KING._,_K._   I’ll know.
2932,_KING._,

2934,_KING._,
2935,_KING._,_K._ Trust thee! what means this?
2936,_KING._,
2937,_KING._,_Sa._                           ’Tis a forbidden paper.
2938,_KING._,’Twould anger you to see it.
2939,_KING._,
2940,_KING._,"_K._                       By heaven, I am angered"
2941,_KING._,Before I see it. What is it thou wouldst hide?
2942,_KING._,
2943,_KING._,_Sa._ It is a letter which I have intercepted
2944,_KING._,From Almeh to the prince. If you have pity
2945,_KING._,"On your own flesh, beseech you, let me use it"
2946,_KING._,As I judge fit.
2947,_KING._,
2948,_KING._,_K._          And well discovered now.      1729
2949,_KING._,"By God, wouldst thou play carrier? Give it to me."
2950,_KING._,
2951,_KING._,_Sa._ It hath not been five minutes in my hands.
2952,_KING._,
2953,_KING._,_K._ And shall not be. (_Takes._) Go fetch the prince.
2954,_KING._,
2955,_KING._,"_Sa._ If you should read it, sire, and find therein"
2956,_KING._,Messages of such softness as might melt
2957,_KING._,"The stubbornness of Ferdinand, I pray you,"
2958,_KING._,"For her sweet sake that writ it, let it go"
2959,_KING._,And do its errand.
2960,_KING._,
2961,_KING._,_K._             Go thou and do thine.      [_Exit Sala._
2962,_KING._,Will he too plot against me! Let us see
2963,_KING._,"What style she dares. _Thy death, O my beloved,"
2964,_KING._,"Already is avenged._—O very tenderly,      1740"
2965,_KING._,And most determined.—_Willingly I suffer
2966,_KING._,What pains of thine I may. ’Tis all my joy
2967,_KING._,To have taken neither food nor rest
2968,_KING._,Since first thou wert deprived; nor will I take
2969,_KING._,Till thou be respited._—Why this might move him.
2970,_KING._,"_Oh, if thou diest!_—Ah, great heavens,"
2971,_KING._,What read I here? Now I see all. Baptized!
2972,_KING._,_Baptized in secret by thy countrymen._
2973,_KING._,Baptized! Then let her perish. She is dead.
2974,_KING._,"I cast her off. _Till now I hid this from thee,_      1750"
2975,_KING._,_Doubting my worthiness._—He doth not know it.
2976,_KING._,He shall not know. None shall know. We will die.
2977,_KING._,"I will slay all. I will go down to the grave,"
2978,_KING._,"And plead my cause before the holy angels,"
2979,_KING._,"Whether it may be permitted for a princess,"
2980,_KING._,"Against her father and faith....—Nay, is’t not writ"
2981,_KING._,"There is there no vain discourse nor charge of sin,"
2982,_KING._,But pleasure to the faithful? And I to die
2983,_KING._,With house and kingdom shamed! How would my crown
2984,_KING._,"Shine ’mong the blessed caliphs, and the martyrs"
2985,_KING._,Who fell in fight upon the road of God?      1761
2986,_KING._,"How would they look upon me,"
2987,_KING._,"If ’mong their moonbright scimitars I came,"
2988,_KING._,"My child’s blood on my head? and she not there,"
2989,_KING._,"The fair flower of my life, the bud of grace,"
2990,_KING._,Which my long-withering and widowed tree
2991,_KING._,"Held to the face of heaven,"
2992,_KING._,Now from my own trunk by my own hands torn.
2993,_KING._,Better the bole be split: heaven’s lightning rend me:
2994,_KING._,"All curses seize me. Almeh, thou must not die.      1770"

3004,_KING._,"_K._          Why look’st thou thus upon me, Sala?"
3005,_KING._,
3006,_KING._,"_Sa._ Because, sire, thou’st dishonoured me, and slain"
3007,_KING._,"A noble warrior, who gave me life."
3008,_KING._,
3009,_KING._,_K._ Slain him!
3010,_KING._,
3011,_KING._,"_Sa._         Ay, king: except thou raise the dead."
3012,_KING._,"For tho’he breathes, ’tis with such failing gasps"
3013,_KING._,As mastering death allows to his sure prey.
3014,_KING._,
3015,_KING._,_K._ Thou art over-fearful; three days without food
3016,_KING._,"Should make him weak and faint, but not to death."
3017,_KING._,"Nay, I am determined now he shall not die.      1780"
3018,_KING._,Food will restore him. Set me here a table
3019,_KING._,"With meat and drink: here in the garden set it,"
3020,_KING._,"And he shall eat at once. See it be done,"
3021,_KING._,And quickly.
3022,_KING._,
3023,_KING._,"_Sa._      Sire, I obey: tho’’tis too late.      [_Exit._"
3024,_KING._,
3025,_KING._,"_During the King’s following speech, servants come in with table,"
3026,_KING._,"etc., which they set down, and go out._"
3027,_KING._,
3028,_KING._,"_K._ He must not die, since only by his life"
3029,_KING._,I can save Almeh: and ’tis not too late.
3030,_KING._,"The sight of food will tempt, the taste restore him:"
3031,_KING._,"He will yield. I have here too what will move him,"
3032,_KING._,"This letter; were he built of Atlas stone,"
3033,_KING._,"For Almeh’s sake he must relent. I know,      1790"
3034,_KING._,I see what must be done. I can consent:
3035,_KING._,For such alliance with an ancient foe
3036,_KING._,"Is honourable. Peace between the realms,"
3037,_KING._,Happiness to both houses—bought may be
3038,_KING._,With sacrifice on my side—yet there’s pride
3039,_KING._,"On both to balance: and, this way refused,"
3040,_KING._,’Tis hell and death. And he will thank me too.
3041,_KING._,He is brave and noble; and the stoutest foes
3042,_KING._,"Are won to stoutest friendship. See, he comes."
3043,_KING._,
3044,_KING._,"_Enter Fer., upborne between two Moorish soldiers._"
3045,_KING._,
3046,_KING._,"Prince Ferdinand, our quarrel comes to end.      1800"
3047,_KING._,A message has arrived from prince Enrique.
3048,_KING._,"Your brother Edward, that was king, is dead."
3049,_KING._,Wherefore the power which I have used on thee
3050,_KING._,I now relax. I have a gentler purpose
3051,_KING._,"And a persuasion thou mayst guess; while thou,"
3052,_KING._,"Owing no loyalty but to thyself,"
3053,_KING._,I am well assured wilt not be slow to meet me.
3054,_KING._,Sit with me first and eat: when thou’rt restored
3055,_KING._,We will compose these matters at our leisure:
3056,_KING._,"Which done, and peace agreed, thou mayst return"
3057,_KING._,In time to pay thy brother’s memory      1811
3058,_KING._,The sorrow it deserves: and in his place
3059,_KING._,"Govern the Portuguese. See, there’s thy life,"
3060,_KING._,Thy strength and restoration. Sit and eat.
3061,_KING._,
3062,_FERDINAND._,_FERDINAND._
3063,_FERDINAND._,
3064,_FERDINAND._,"I feel no hunger, sire. The time is past"
3065,_FERDINAND._,When thou couldst save my life.
3066,_FERDINAND._,
3067,_FERDINAND._,_K._                          Despair not.
3068,_FERDINAND._,
3069,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._                                   Nay,"
3070,_FERDINAND._,I do not know the word.
3071,_FERDINAND._,
3072,_FERDINAND._,_K._                  This is despair.
3073,_FERDINAND._,"Come, sit and eat."
3074,_FERDINAND._,
3075,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._           I say the wish is past.
3076,_FERDINAND._,
3077,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Dost thou not then believe? See in this paper
3078,_FERDINAND._,Writ to thyself. (_Gives._)
3079,_FERDINAND._,(_Aside._) Life doth not tempt this man.      1820
3080,_FERDINAND._,The call to rule his people yet may move him.
3081,_FERDINAND._,What readst thou now therein?
3082,_FERDINAND._,
3083,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                      What thou hast said.
3084,_FERDINAND._,My brother Edward’s soul rest in God’s peace!
3085,_FERDINAND._,
3086,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Is nought else in thy paper?
3087,_FERDINAND._,
3088,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._                          Ay, there’s more."
3089,_FERDINAND._,"I’d not conceal it. Prince Enrique writes,"
3090,_FERDINAND._,"If I return not to his camp to-night,"
3091,_FERDINAND._,He comes himself in force to rescue me.
3092,_FERDINAND._,
3093,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Trust not to such deliverance.
3094,_FERDINAND._,
3095,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._                            Nay, O king:"
3096,_FERDINAND._,"For cometh he at even or at morn,"
3097,_FERDINAND._,"To-morrow or to-day, he cometh late.      1830"
3098,_FERDINAND._,"My eves and morns are passed, and my deliverance"
3099,_FERDINAND._,"Is nearer than his coming: yet for that,"
3100,_FERDINAND._,"Tho’I shall see him not when he doth come,"
3101,_FERDINAND._,Not the less will he come; for so he saith.
3102,_FERDINAND._,
3103,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Thou wilt not eat and live?
3104,_FERDINAND._,
3105,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._                         I thank thee, sire."
3106,_FERDINAND._,
3107,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ (_to attendants_). Set the prince in the chair, and all go out;"
3108,_FERDINAND._,And send the guard within.
3109,_FERDINAND._,
3110,_FERDINAND._,[_They obey. As they go out they take with them the sentinel from the
3111,_FERDINAND._,pit gate. From this point the stage gradually begins to darken to end
3112,_FERDINAND._,of act._
3113,_FERDINAND._,
3114,_FERDINAND._,"Now, prince, we are left alone, eat what I give thee."
3115,_FERDINAND._,
3116,_FERDINAND._,[_Puts food towards him._
3117,_FERDINAND._,
3118,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._ Why should I eat?
3119,_FERDINAND._,
3120,_FERDINAND._,_K._ (_pouring_).      Myself I pour the wine.
3121,_FERDINAND._,Drink with me. ’Tis thy life.
3122,_FERDINAND._,
3123,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                      Why should I live?      1840
3124,_FERDINAND._,
3125,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ Canst thou not guess? I’ll tell thee then, and speak"
3126,_FERDINAND._,Not as a foe. Thy will hath conquered mine;
3127,_FERDINAND._,"And if I wronged thee, thou hast wronged me more."
3128,_FERDINAND._,"Thou hast loved my daughter, and strangely won her love"
3129,_FERDINAND._,"Away from him whom for my son I had chosen,"
3130,_FERDINAND._,And pillar of my house: thou hast driven away
3131,_FERDINAND._,"My best ally, and left my kingdom naked:—"
3132,_FERDINAND._,For this thy death would be but fair revenge.
3133,_FERDINAND._,And there’s a secret cause why I should hate thee
3134,_FERDINAND._,Above all this: thou hast suborned my daughter:
3135,_FERDINAND._,"She hath denied her faith. See there: (_gives letter_) see there, 1851"
3136,_FERDINAND._,What she hath writ. Read all. Seest thou not now?
3137,_FERDINAND._,"’Tis true, she kills herself; she dies for thee."
3138,_FERDINAND._,"Yet I’ll forgive thee; tho’she is none of mine,"
3139,_FERDINAND._,"Apostate, disobedient.—Yet for her"
3140,_FERDINAND._,"I will forgive thee. See, ’tis for her sake"
3141,_FERDINAND._,I pray thee eat.
3142,_FERDINAND._,
3143,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._         Too late, ’twould be too late."
3144,_FERDINAND._,
3145,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Say not too late: that word is death. Thou’rt brave.
3146,_FERDINAND._,"Tho’not for me, yet for her sake I bid thee"
3147,_FERDINAND._,"Eat, drink, and live. So she may live, and thou—"
3148,_FERDINAND._,The altitude of thrones may overlook      1861
3149,_FERDINAND._,Such differences—I give her thee to wife.
3150,_FERDINAND._,"Save us, I pray."
3151,_FERDINAND._,
3152,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._         What hear I? wouldst thou then
3153,_FERDINAND._,Have given me in good faith Almeh to wife?
3154,_FERDINAND._,
3155,_FERDINAND._,[_Makes motions towards food._
3156,_FERDINAND._,
3157,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ And will. Ay, drink."
3158,_FERDINAND._,
3159,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                  And Ceuta?
3160,_FERDINAND._,
3161,_FERDINAND._,"_K._                             That is mine,"
3162,_FERDINAND._,Her price.
3163,_FERDINAND._,
3164,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._ (_thrusting things from him_). Ah, never."
3165,_FERDINAND._,
3166,_FERDINAND._,_K._                               Dost thou then refuse?
3167,_FERDINAND._,
3168,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._ It cheereth death to spend my last breath thus.
3169,_FERDINAND._,
3170,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ Sittest thou there balanced ’twixt death and life,"
3171,_FERDINAND._,"Daintily making choice, and to my offer"
3172,_FERDINAND._,"Of all that God could grant thee, life and love,      1870"
3173,_FERDINAND._,"Wrung from me by my sorrow, to my shame"
3174,_FERDINAND._,Preferrest the Christian hell? O Infidel
3175,_FERDINAND._,"Apostatizing dog, lest now thy mouth"
3176,_FERDINAND._,Should find the power to gasp one broken speech
3177,_FERDINAND._,"Of triumph over me, die at my hand."
3178,_FERDINAND._,Death shall not rob me of thy blood that’s left.
3179,_FERDINAND._,
3180,_FERDINAND._,[_Stabs Fer. across the table._
3181,_FERDINAND._,
3182,_FERDINAND._,"Thus let thy brother find thee, if I fail"
3183,_FERDINAND._,"To send him also thither, where thou goest"
3184,_FERDINAND._,To thine idolatrous and thieving sires.      [_Exit._

3189,_FERDINAND._,
3190,_FERDINAND._,We come with laboured breath      1880
3191,_FERDINAND._,Climbing from underground:—
3192,_FERDINAND._,In fear we creep and quake:—
3193,_FERDINAND._,"What voice with furious sound,"
3194,_FERDINAND._,Choking in wrath outspake
3195,_FERDINAND._,The names of blood and death?—
3196,_FERDINAND._,Who is here?—Look around.—
3197,_FERDINAND._,Hearken!—the broken moan
3198,_FERDINAND._,Of the ever-murmuring sea
3199,_FERDINAND._,Reaches my ear alone—
3200,_FERDINAND._,"Come forward, ye may dare,      1890"
3201,_FERDINAND._,All is quite still and free.—
3202,_FERDINAND._,"Ah, stay! behold him there,"
3203,_FERDINAND._,That sitteth with his head
3204,_FERDINAND._,Upon his breast bent low—
3205,_FERDINAND._,"The prince—the prince.—Forbear,"
3206,_FERDINAND._,"He sleepeth.—Nay, I fear,"
3207,_FERDINAND._,Now may the truth strike dead
3208,_FERDINAND._,My terror—step thou near—
3209,_FERDINAND._,"Gently.—Alas! woe, woe,"
3210,_FERDINAND._,"Woe, woe, woe, woe, he is dead.      1900"
3211,_FERDINAND._,He sits dead in his chair.
3212,_FERDINAND._,
3213,_FERDINAND._,"See at his heart, where yet"
3214,_FERDINAND._,The murderous wound is wet.—
3215,_FERDINAND._,"Our prince, our prince is dead—"
3216,_FERDINAND._,They have slain him in their spite—
3217,_FERDINAND._,"Ai, ai, ai, ai! Who now"
3218,_FERDINAND._,"Can save us? We are lost men, friends; we are lost—"
3219,_FERDINAND._,"And thou, who saidst that we should live to fight,"
3220,_FERDINAND._,Where are thy arms? Didst thou not make a boast
3221,_FERDINAND._,"That thou couldst see God’s will?—We are quite forsaken,      1910"
3222,_FERDINAND._,"Forgotten—(1.) Refrain, refrain. Can God forget?"
3223,_FERDINAND._,
3224,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._ Who could refrain? Alas! Hath not long woe
3225,_FERDINAND._,Crushed us so low?—Ah me! This is our pain.—
3226,_FERDINAND._,"Now we deplore, alas!—Hell and despair!—"
3227,_FERDINAND._,Now it is plain—O woe—we are no more
3228,_FERDINAND._,What once we were.—
3229,_FERDINAND._,
3230,_FERDINAND._,"(1.) Renew your courage, and devote your care"
3231,_FERDINAND._,In solemn duty to the dead. Upraise
3232,_FERDINAND._,"This noble corpse, and bear it to the bower;"
3233,_FERDINAND._,"Where, roofed by rose and jasmine, it may lie      1920"
3234,_FERDINAND._,Hid from the dews of swift descending night.
3235,_FERDINAND._,"Take ye the feet, while I uplift the head,"
3236,_FERDINAND._,"And, grasping in the midst, ye, by his robe,"
3237,_FERDINAND._,"Bear him with slow accommodated step,"
3238,_FERDINAND._,Where we may best dispose his limbs in peace.
3239,_FERDINAND._,
3240,_FERDINAND._,[_Exeunt bearers with Fer.'s body to bower._
3241,_FERDINAND._,
3242,_FERDINAND._,"_Bearers._  Alas, ah! noble prince,"
3243,_FERDINAND._,What burial wilt thou have?
3244,_FERDINAND._,"Far from where thy fathers lie,"
3245,_FERDINAND._,"In a heathen grave,"
3246,_FERDINAND._,If grave they give thee at all.      1930
3247,_FERDINAND._,Yet will thy country mourn;
3248,_FERDINAND._,"And where victorious banners hang,"
3249,_FERDINAND._,"And hymns of Christian joy are sung,"
3250,_FERDINAND._,Upraise thine empty tomb.

3254,_FERDINAND._,"Who bids us hope?—There is no hope, no hope:"
3255,_FERDINAND._,I’ll mask my thought no more.

3263,_FERDINAND._,
3264,_FERDINAND._,(1.)                                This letter here.
3265,_FERDINAND._,
3266,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._ What letter? say.      1940
3267,_FERDINAND._,
3268,_FERDINAND._,(1.)                  ’Tis from the prince Enrique.
3269,_FERDINAND._,
3270,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._ Read! read!
3271,_FERDINAND._,
3272,_FERDINAND._,"(1.)            ’Tis written to prince Ferdinand,"
3273,_FERDINAND._,In our home speech. ’Twas in his grasp.
3274,_FERDINAND._,
3275,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._                                 Read! read!
3276,_FERDINAND._,
3277,_FERDINAND._,"(1.) _Unless I have thee in my camp to-night,"
3278,_FERDINAND._,At morn I rescue thee._
3279,_FERDINAND._,
3280,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._                 Where is the camp?
3281,_FERDINAND._,
3282,_FERDINAND._,"(1.) A league hence to the west, he writes."
3283,_FERDINAND._,
3284,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._                                     Alas!
3285,_FERDINAND._,Now they have slain his brother he will not come.—
3286,_FERDINAND._,"Or, should he come, then in the siege he makes"
3287,_FERDINAND._,Hunger will slay us all.—
3288,_FERDINAND._,
3289,_FERDINAND._,(1.)                     Hark then to me.      (_Stage darkens more._)
3290,_FERDINAND._,He lying so near we may escape to him.
3291,_FERDINAND._,
3292,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._ How shall we escape?—The guards upon the walls      1950
3293,_FERDINAND._,Would see us.—They would send pursuit of horse
3294,_FERDINAND._,To cut us down.—
3295,_FERDINAND._,
3296,_FERDINAND._,(1.)            Not now. I said not now;
3297,_FERDINAND._,But later in darkest night.
3298,_FERDINAND._,
3299,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._                     And how to escape?
3300,_FERDINAND._,
3301,_FERDINAND._,(1.) See here the prince’s sword: with this in hand
3302,_FERDINAND._,"To creep at midnight on our sentinel,"
3303,_FERDINAND._,And slay him: then in darkness unperceived
3304,_FERDINAND._,To climb out o’er the wall.
3305,_FERDINAND._,
3306,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._                     Now sayst thou well.
3307,_FERDINAND._,
3308,_FERDINAND._,(1.) Ye trust me now?
3309,_FERDINAND._,
3310,_FERDINAND._,"_Ch._               Ay, ay: if thou canst kill him."
3311,_FERDINAND._,
3312,_FERDINAND._,"(1.) Obey me, and I will lead you forth to-night."
3313,_FERDINAND._,
3314,_FERDINAND._,_Ch._ What to do?      1960
3315,_FERDINAND._,
3316,_FERDINAND._,(1.)            Hush ye! Our careless sentinel
3317,_FERDINAND._,Must soon return. Let him not see us here.
3318,_FERDINAND._,"Begone, and some take up this food and wine,"
3319,_FERDINAND._,"Which we may share below to help our strength,"
3320,_FERDINAND._,"Hiding it 'neath your garments, as do I"
3321,_FERDINAND._,The sword. With silent step troop to your shades.

3327,_FERDINAND._,
3328,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Come forth and see!
3329,_FERDINAND._,
3330,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                  The night hath wrapped thy deed
3331,_FERDINAND._,"In fourfold darkness, that I should not see."
3332,_FERDINAND._,
3333,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Thine eyes are straitened by the light within:
3334,_FERDINAND._,’Tis not so dark but we shall see anon.

3340,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._               I complain ’tis ill-repaid.
3341,_FERDINAND._,I am ill-repaid.
3342,_FERDINAND._,

3344,_FERDINAND._,
3345,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                Prince Ferdinand
3346,_FERDINAND._,Had given me life.
3347,_FERDINAND._,
3348,_FERDINAND._,_K._             Stay. Why harbourest thou still
3349,_FERDINAND._,That grudge against me? Didst thou read her letter
3350,_FERDINAND._,I gave thee?
3351,_FERDINAND._,
3352,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._      I did.
3353,_FERDINAND._,
3354,_FERDINAND._,_K._            Thou didst: and canst not guess?
3355,_FERDINAND._,To save her life I yielded. I consented
3356,_FERDINAND._,To make this man my son. If he would live
3357,_FERDINAND._,"And give up Ceuta, then I promised him"
3358,_FERDINAND._,Almeh to wife.
3359,_FERDINAND._,
3360,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._        What hear I?
3361,_FERDINAND._,
3362,_FERDINAND._,"_K._                    When he refused,"
3363,_FERDINAND._,I smote him through.
3364,_FERDINAND._,
3365,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._              Refused!
3366,_FERDINAND._,
3367,_FERDINAND._,_K._                      There where he sits.      1980

3370,_FERDINAND._,
3371,_FERDINAND._,"_K._                   Ay, by the prophet. Ha!"
3372,_FERDINAND._,He is gone.
3373,_FERDINAND._,
3374,_FERDINAND._,"_Sa._     Nay, none is here."
3375,_FERDINAND._,
3376,_FERDINAND._,_K._                       He hath yet found strength
3377,_FERDINAND._,To crawl away to die. ’Twill not be far.
3378,_FERDINAND._,Hark! heardst thou that? Again.      [_Sighing heard._
3379,_FERDINAND._,
3380,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                         ’Twas some one sighed.
3381,_FERDINAND._,
3382,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ ’Twas that way, Sala: seek about."
3383,_FERDINAND._,
3384,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                                The moon
3385,_FERDINAND._,"Is up, but curtained by yon inky cloud,"
3386,_FERDINAND._,Cannot shine forth. Let me go fetch a lantern.
3387,_FERDINAND._,
3388,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ Go, go. I will watch here.      [_Exit Sala._"
3389,_FERDINAND._,Why should I fear?
3390,_FERDINAND._,I’ll draw my sword. (_Calling._) Ferdinand!
3391,_FERDINAND._,"(_The sighing again._) If thou canst speak, say where thou art.   1990"
3392,_FERDINAND._,"Answer me: Dost thou live? nay, sigh not so."
3393,_FERDINAND._,If yet thou livest I think I would abate. (_The sighing._)
3394,_FERDINAND._,"Now ’tis here, now ’tis there. Thank heaven, the moon:"
3395,_FERDINAND._,
3396,_FERDINAND._,"(_Moon appears, and shews ghost of Ferdinand midway back._)"
3397,_FERDINAND._,
3398,_FERDINAND._,I see him. He stands upright! Prince Ferdinand!
3399,_FERDINAND._,"He walketh from me. Stay. I bid thee stand,—"
3400,_FERDINAND._,"By heaven, or I will slay thee. Villain, traitor!"
3401,_FERDINAND._,
3402,_FERDINAND._,"[_Goes after ghost, makes a lunge at him, and ghost vanishes._"
3403,_FERDINAND._,
3404,_FERDINAND._,_Re-enter Sala._
3405,_FERDINAND._,
3406,_FERDINAND._,"_Sa._ What noise is that? What, sire: with thy sword drawn!"
3407,_FERDINAND._,
3408,_FERDINAND._,_K._ Didst thou not see him?
3409,_FERDINAND._,
3410,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                      The Prince?
3411,_FERDINAND._,
3412,_FERDINAND._,_K._                                 Ay.
3413,_FERDINAND._,
3414,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                                  Was it the prince
3415,_FERDINAND._,You spake with?
3416,_FERDINAND._,
3417,_FERDINAND._,"_K._          Ay, he lives."
3418,_FERDINAND._,
3419,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                     And drew you upon him?
3420,_FERDINAND._,
3421,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ I called to him, Sala, and he made away:      2000"
3422,_FERDINAND._,I followed him to stay him.
3423,_FERDINAND._,
3424,_FERDINAND._,"_Sa._                     Thank God, he lives."
3425,_FERDINAND._,You did not strike him.
3426,_FERDINAND._,
3427,_FERDINAND._,"_K._                  Nay, I struck him not."
3428,_FERDINAND._,
3429,_FERDINAND._,"_Sa._ ’Tis now like day. I see him nowhere, sire."
3430,_FERDINAND._,
3431,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ He hath hid himself. Look, Sala; search about."
3432,_FERDINAND._,"I’ll sit awhile. See; why the food is gone,"
3433,_FERDINAND._,The food that he refused. He hath eaten all.
3434,_FERDINAND._,His weakness was but feigned.
3435,_FERDINAND._,
3436,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                       I’ll search about.
3437,_FERDINAND._,
3438,_FERDINAND._,_K._ He stood and walked upright as if unhurt.
3439,_FERDINAND._,"Yet how, unless he be a devil in flesh"
3440,_FERDINAND._,Could he have 'scaped my mortal thrust?
3441,_FERDINAND._,
3442,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._ (_in the arbour_).              Alas!      2010
3443,_FERDINAND._,"He is here, he is dead."
3444,_FERDINAND._,
3445,_FERDINAND._,_K._                  How now! he is dead?      [_Goes to arbour._
3446,_FERDINAND._,
3447,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._ (_coming out_).                    He is slain.
3448,_FERDINAND._,"May heaven forgive thee! (_Aside._) Murdered, most basely murdered,"
3449,_FERDINAND._,"And by this shifty, inconsiderate king."
3450,_FERDINAND._,Murdered for pride; because he would not take
3451,_FERDINAND._,"The gift that was begrudged. Oh, Almeh, Almeh,"
3452,_FERDINAND._,Thou hadst a noble and a gentle lover.
3453,_FERDINAND._,
3454,_FERDINAND._,"_K._ (_re-entering_). How came he there, Sala? How could I see him?"
3455,_FERDINAND._,’Tis true he is dead and cold.
3456,_FERDINAND._,
3457,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._                        The Christian captives
3458,_FERDINAND._,"Have caused our error. They have eaten the food,"
3459,_FERDINAND._,And laid their prince’s body in the bower:      2020
3460,_FERDINAND._,"It was their sighing that we heard, re-echoed"
3461,_FERDINAND._,From the deep pit.
3462,_FERDINAND._,
3463,_FERDINAND._,"_K._             By heaven,"
3464,_FERDINAND._,"I saw him, Sala, when the moon shone out:"
3465,_FERDINAND._,He stood upright before me; while I spoke
3466,_FERDINAND._,He walked away.
3467,_FERDINAND._,
3468,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._           ’Tis like your majesty
3469,_FERDINAND._,Hath been deluded by some airy vision
3470,_FERDINAND._,Bred in the troubled brain.
3471,_FERDINAND._,
3472,_FERDINAND._,"_K._                      Nay, he was there."
3473,_FERDINAND._,
3474,_FERDINAND._,_Sa._ The spirits of the dead have power to fix
3475,_FERDINAND._,The image of their presence in the place
3476,_FERDINAND._,Where life was robbed: there are a thousand stories
3477,_FERDINAND._,Of such frail apparitions.
3478,_FERDINAND._,
3479,_FERDINAND._,_Enter Messenger._
3480,_FERDINAND._,
3481,_FERDINAND._,_K._                     Who cometh here?      2031
3482,_FERDINAND._,
3483,_MESSENGER._,_MESSENGER._
3484,_MESSENGER._,
3485,_MESSENGER._,Your majesty’s command.
3486,_MESSENGER._,
3487,_MESSENGER._,_K._                    I know thee: speak.
3488,_MESSENGER._,
3489,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ The scouts returned report the Christians camped
3490,_MESSENGER._,To north of Alrah on the stream’s left bank.
3491,_MESSENGER._,"They do not hold the hill, and set no guard"
3492,_MESSENGER._,Save on their front.
3493,_MESSENGER._,
3494,_MESSENGER._,_K._               What numbers are they guessed?
3495,_MESSENGER._,
3496,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ At some four thousand: and prince Ferdinand
3497,_MESSENGER._,Is with them.
3498,_MESSENGER._,
3499,_MESSENGER._,_K._        Who?
3500,_MESSENGER._,
3501,_MESSENGER._,"_Mess._        The scouts, your majesty,"
3502,_MESSENGER._,Spake of prince Ferdinand’s escape. They saw him
3503,_MESSENGER._,Ride at full speed into the Christian camp.      2040
3504,_MESSENGER._,
3505,_MESSENGER._,_K._ When saw they him?
3506,_MESSENGER._,
3507,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._               At dusk.
3508,_MESSENGER._,
3509,_MESSENGER._,_K._                         It could not be.
3510,_MESSENGER._,
3511,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ They tell he galloped thro’their company.
3512,_MESSENGER._,They might have touched him. When they called his name
3513,_MESSENGER._,He took no heed. Some fired their pieces at him:
3514,_MESSENGER._,"And some pursued: but he, as tho’his horse"
3515,_MESSENGER._,"Were winged, held on, nor ever turned his head,"
3516,_MESSENGER._,And soon was out of reach.
3517,_MESSENGER._,
3518,_MESSENGER._,_K._                     Enough. Begone.      [_Exit Messenger._
3519,_MESSENGER._,"I knew I had seen him, Sala: ’tis his spirit."
3520,_MESSENGER._,What is thy counsel?
3521,_MESSENGER._,
3522,_MESSENGER._,_Sa._              Think no more of this.
3523,_MESSENGER._,Take a sufficient force within the walls:      2050
3524,_MESSENGER._,"The rest entrenched upon the hill without,"
3525,_MESSENGER._,We must abide their coming on at dawn.
3526,_MESSENGER._,
3527,_MESSENGER._,_K._ What is your force?
3528,_MESSENGER._,
3529,_MESSENGER._,_Sa._                  At most eight hundred men.
3530,_MESSENGER._,
3531,_MESSENGER._,"_K._ We are so o’ermatched, Sala, I shall not wait,"
3532,_MESSENGER._,I shall assault their camp to-night. The darkness
3533,_MESSENGER._,Will hide our numbers: we will steal upon them.
3534,_MESSENGER._,
3535,_MESSENGER._,"_Sa._ I pray you, sire, be well advised. Consider,"
3536,_MESSENGER._,If our small force be sundered in the darkness....
3537,_MESSENGER._,
3538,_MESSENGER._,_K._ The darkness is our friend. We know the ground.
3539,_MESSENGER._,Would I could blot the moon from heaven to-night.
3540,_MESSENGER._,My plan is fixed. Take thou five hundred men      2061
3541,_MESSENGER._,"And steal upon their rear, when battle joins"
3542,_MESSENGER._,I with the rest will charge their front.
3543,_MESSENGER._,
3544,_MESSENGER._,_Sa._                                  My duty
3545,_MESSENGER._,"Bids me dissuade thee, ere I can obey."
3546,_MESSENGER._,
3547,_MESSENGER._,"_K._ I am brave to fight, Sala: but not to wait;"
3548,_MESSENGER._,"I will not wait an hour; nay, not an instant."
3549,_MESSENGER._,"Thou wilt not move me. Not a word, I bid thee."
3550,_MESSENGER._,"’Tis my last hope. Come, get thy men together:"
3551,_MESSENGER._,"If once they hear these hellish tales, we are lost."

3564,_ZAPEL._,The night is sharp and cold: thou art not clad
3565,_ZAPEL._,To encounter its brisk sting.

3567,_ALMEH._,_ALMEH._
3568,_ALMEH._,
3569,_ALMEH._,"Nay, I must breathe."
3570,_ALMEH._,"I fell into a stifling slumber, Zapel;"
3571,_ALMEH._,And woke affrighted in a sweat of terror.
3572,_ALMEH._,
3573,_ALMEH._,"_Za._ For heaven’s sake, lady, let thy spirit be soothed:"
3574,_ALMEH._,Thou killest thyself.

3576,_ALMEH._,"_Al._ Air, air! that from the thousand frozen founts"
3577,_ALMEH._,"Of heaven art rained upon the drowsy earth,"
3578,_ALMEH._,And gathering keenness from the diamond ways
3579,_ALMEH._,Of faery moonbeams visitest our world      2080
3580,_ALMEH._,"To make renewal of its jaded life,"
3581,_ALMEH._,"Breathe, breathe! ’Tis drunken with the stolen scents"
3582,_ALMEH._,Of sleeping pinks: heavy with kisses snatched
3583,_ALMEH._,"From roses, that in crowds of softest snow"
3584,_ALMEH._,Dream of the moon upon their blanchèd bowers.
3585,_ALMEH._,"I drink, I drink."
3586,_ALMEH._,

3588,_ALMEH._,Let me go fetch thy cloak.
3589,_ALMEH._,
3590,_ALMEH._,_Al._                    Where is my father?
3591,_ALMEH._,
3592,_ALMEH._,_Za._ He is not in the castle.
3593,_ALMEH._,
3594,_ALMEH._,_Al._                        Where is Sala?
3595,_ALMEH._,I must speak with him.
3596,_ALMEH._,
3597,_ALMEH._,_Za._                They are both sallied forth
3598,_ALMEH._,To assault the Christian camp.
3599,_ALMEH._,
3600,_ALMEH._,_Al._                        O then ’twas true      2090
3601,_ALMEH._,"The noise I heard. They are fighting: ’twas the guns,"
3602,_ALMEH._,The shouts I heard. I thought ’twas in my ears.
3603,_ALMEH._,"—I have had strange visions, Zapel, these last days:"
3604,_ALMEH._,’Twere past belief what I have seen and heard.
3605,_ALMEH._,"I’ll tell thee somewhat when I have time—O love,"
3606,_ALMEH._,"If thou wouldst be my muse,"
3607,_ALMEH._,I would enchant the sun;
3608,_ALMEH._,"And steal the silken hues,"
3609,_ALMEH._,Whereof his light is spun:
3610,_ALMEH._,And from the whispering way      2100
3611,_ALMEH._,Of the enarching air
3612,_ALMEH._,Look with the dawn of day
3613,_ALMEH._,Upon the countries fair.
3614,_ALMEH._,
3615,_ALMEH._,"_Za._ See, I will fetch thy cloak.      [_Exit._"
3616,_ALMEH._,
3617,_ALMEH._,_Al._                            This is the reason
3618,_ALMEH._,"Why all’s so quiet. Sweet peace, thou dost lie."
3619,_ALMEH._,"Men steal forth silently to kill: they creep,"
3620,_ALMEH._,"That they may spring to murder. Who would think,"
3621,_ALMEH._,"Gazing on this fair garden, as it lieth"
3622,_ALMEH._,Lulled by the moonlight and the solemn music
3623,_ALMEH._,"Made everlastingly by the grave sea,      2110"
3624,_ALMEH._,"That ’twas a hell of villany, a dungeon"
3625,_ALMEH._,Of death to its possessors. Death.—
3626,_ALMEH._,
3627,_ALMEH._,_Za._ (_re-entering_). Here is thy cloak.
3628,_ALMEH._,
3629,_ALMEH._,"_Al._                                   Away! what dost thou think,"
3630,_ALMEH._,"Zapel, of death? I’ll tell thee. Nay, I promise"
3631,_ALMEH._,"I’ve much to tell.—Thou’st heard, when one is dead,"
3632,_ALMEH._,"An angel comes to him where he lies buried,"
3633,_ALMEH._,"And bids him sit upright, and questions him"
3634,_ALMEH._,Of Islam and Mohammet. ’Tis not so.
3635,_ALMEH._,For in my dream I saw the spirits of men
3636,_ALMEH._,Stand to be judged: along the extended line      2120
3637,_ALMEH._,"Of their vast crowd in heaven, that like the sea"
3638,_ALMEH._,Swayed in uncertain sheen upon the bounds
3639,_ALMEH._,"Of its immensity, nor yet for that"
3640,_ALMEH._,"Trespassed too far upon the airy shores,"
3641,_ALMEH._,"I gazed. The unclouded plain, whereon we stood,"
3642,_ALMEH._,"Had no distinction from the air above,"
3643,_ALMEH._,"Yet lacked not foothold to that host of spirits,"
3644,_ALMEH._,"In all things like to men, save for the brightness"
3645,_ALMEH._,"Of incorruptible life, which they gave forth."
3646,_ALMEH._,Wondering at this I saw another marvel:      2130
3647,_ALMEH._,"They were not clothed nor naked, but o’er each"
3648,_ALMEH._,A veil of quality or colour thrown
3649,_ALMEH._,"Shewed and distinguished them, with bickering glance"
3650,_ALMEH._,"And gemlike fires, brighter or undiscerned."
3651,_ALMEH._,As when the sun strikes on a sheet of foam
3652,_ALMEH._,"The whole is radiant, but the myriad globes"
3653,_ALMEH._,"Are red or green or blue, with rainbow light"
3654,_ALMEH._,"Caught in the gauzy texture of their coats,—"
3655,_ALMEH._,"So differed they. Then, as I gazed, and saw"
3656,_ALMEH._,"The host before me was of men, and I      2140"
3657,_ALMEH._,"In a like crowd of women stood apart,"
3658,_ALMEH._,"The judgment, which had tarried in my thought,"
3659,_ALMEH._,Began: from out the opposèd line of men
3660,_ALMEH._,Hundreds came singly to the open field
3661,_ALMEH._,"To take their sentence. There, as each stepped forth,"
3662,_ALMEH._,"An angel met him, and from out our band"
3663,_ALMEH._,"Beckoned a woman spirit, in whose joy"
3664,_ALMEH._,"Or gloom his fate was written. Nought was spoken,"
3665,_ALMEH._,And they who from our squadron went to judge
3666,_ALMEH._,"Seemed, as the beckoning angel, passionless.      2150"
3667,_ALMEH._,"Woman and man, ’twas plain to all that saw"
3668,_ALMEH._,"Which way the judgment went: if they were blessed,"
3669,_ALMEH._,A smile of glory from the air around them
3670,_ALMEH._,"Gathered upon their robes, and music sounded"
3671,_ALMEH._,To guide them forward: but to some it happed
3672,_ALMEH._,That darkness settled on them. As a man
3673,_ALMEH._,"Who hears ill tidings wraps his cloak about him,"
3674,_ALMEH._,"For grief, and shrouds his face, not to be seen;"
3675,_ALMEH._,"So these by their own robes were swallowed up,"
3676,_ALMEH._,"Which thinned to blackness and invisible darkness,"
3677,_ALMEH._,"And were no more. Thus, while I wondered much"
3678,_ALMEH._,"How two fates could be justly mixed in one,      2162"
3679,_ALMEH._,Behold a man for whom the beckoning angel
3680,_ALMEH._,"Could find no answering woman, and I watched"
3681,_ALMEH._,What sentence his should be; when I myself
3682,_ALMEH._,Was 'ware that I was called. A radiant spirit
3683,_ALMEH._,Waited for me. I saw prince Ferdinand:—
3684,_ALMEH._,Go tell him that I am here.
3685,_ALMEH._,
3686,_ALMEH._,"_Za._                     I cannot, lady."
3687,_ALMEH._,
3688,_ALMEH._,_Al._ The king and Sala are gone forth to fight:
3689,_ALMEH._,"There’s none can know. Be not afraid. Obey,      2170"
3690,_ALMEH._,
3691,_ALMEH._,_Za._ Alas! alas!
3692,_ALMEH._,
3693,_ALMEH._,_Al._           Why dost thou stand and wail?
3694,_ALMEH._,
3695,_ALMEH._,"_Za._ Oh, I would serve thee; alas! but ’tis too late."
3696,_ALMEH._,
3697,_ALMEH._,_Al._ Too late! how is’t too late? If he were dead....
3698,_ALMEH._,
3699,_ALMEH._,"_Za._ Lady, bear up, I pray thee: for ’tis sure"
3700,_ALMEH._,Thy dream betrayed the truth.
3701,_ALMEH._,
3702,_ALMEH._,_Al._                       The truth! Alas!
3703,_ALMEH._,"Thou dost believe he is dead. Why, folly, think"
3704,_ALMEH._,How could I then be living? It could not be
3705,_ALMEH._,"That I, a feeble woman, full of faintings"
3706,_ALMEH._,"And fears, were more enduring to outlast"
3707,_ALMEH._,"The pangs of hunger than is he, a man      2180"
3708,_ALMEH._,"Whom hardship hath inured. Nay, while I live"
3709,_ALMEH._,He must be living.
3710,_ALMEH._,
3711,_ALMEH._,_Za._            True it is he is dead.
3712,_ALMEH._,
3713,_ALMEH._,"_Al._ Thou art suborned: thou liest, thou dost."
3714,_ALMEH._,Confess.
3715,_ALMEH._,
3716,_ALMEH._,_Za._  O nay.
3717,_ALMEH._,
3718,_ALMEH._,"_Al._       Now God have pity, or thou hast lied."
3719,_ALMEH._,But thou hast lied. Didst thou not say the king
3720,_ALMEH._,Sent for him forth? Didst thou not know the cause?
3721,_ALMEH._,His brother has returned in force to take him.
3722,_ALMEH._,Didst thou not see the dungeon door set wide?
3723,_ALMEH._,And dar’st lie thus?

3727,_ALMEH._,I will go find him if I may.
3728,_ALMEH._,
3729,_ALMEH._,_Al._ (_aside_).           She lied.      2191
3730,_ALMEH._,Now she will fetch him. (_To Za._) Where’s the seat?

3732,_ALMEH._,"_Za._                                              Here, here."
3733,_ALMEH._,
3734,_ALMEH._,_Al._ I am dizzy. Lead me to it. Go fetch the prince.
3735,_ALMEH._,
3736,_ALMEH._,_Za._ Be comforted.
3737,_ALMEH._,
3738,_ALMEH._,"_Al._             Who hath sat here, I say?"
3739,_ALMEH._,Who hath sat here?

3741,_ALMEH._,_Za._            Prithee be comforted.
3742,_ALMEH._,
3743,_ALMEH._,_Al._ If this should be!
3744,_ALMEH._,
3745,_ALMEH._,"_Za._                  Verily we are God’s,"
3746,_ALMEH._,And unto Him return.

3748,_ALMEH._,"_Al._              Thou, thou! Begone."
3749,_ALMEH._,"Stay, Zapel, here: give me my cloak. I am cold."
3750,_ALMEH._,"Since I must die ... think not this strange, I pray."
3751,_ALMEH._,Bring food to me.
3752,_ALMEH._,
3753,_ALMEH._,_Za._           Thank God. ’Tis the sea air      2200
3754,_ALMEH._,Hath quickened thee.
3755,_ALMEH._,
3756,_ALMEH._,_Al._              Thinkst thou that vexèd monster
3757,_ALMEH._,Hath any physic in his briny breath
3758,_ALMEH._,For grief like mine?
3759,_ALMEH._,
3760,_ALMEH._,"_Za._              Lady, have better heart."
3761,_ALMEH._,"Why, thou must live. When once thy tears have fallen"
3762,_ALMEH._,Thou wilt be comforted.
3763,_ALMEH._,
3764,_ALMEH._,_Al._                 How should I weep?
3765,_ALMEH._,Bid men weep who with their light-hearted sin
3766,_ALMEH._,Make the world’s misery: bid women weep

3768,_ALMEH._,Why should I weep? Begone: bring me food here.
3769,_ALMEH._,
3770,_ALMEH._,_Za._ O that I am glad to do. Thank God for this.
3771,_ALMEH._,
3772,_ALMEH._,[_Exit._
3773,_ALMEH._,
3774,_ALMEH._,_Al._ Why did she lie to me? Had they a plot
3775,_ALMEH._,To make me think he is dead? Sala’s my friend:
3776,_ALMEH._,Sala sent word of hope: and if he lives
3777,_ALMEH._,"All may be saved. Nay, if he be not gone,"
3778,_ALMEH._,"If yet he is in the castle, I may find him."
3779,_ALMEH._,I’ll give him food: we will steal forth together:
3780,_ALMEH._,I have marked the way: and by the rocks of the shore
3781,_ALMEH._,We may lie hid till we may reach the camp.
3782,_ALMEH._,Now would I had kept my strength. Had I foreseen
3783,_ALMEH._,This chance.... There’s none about. ’Tis not too
3784,_ALMEH._,late.      [_Noise of guns and fighting heard._
3785,_ALMEH._,"I may dare call. Prince Ferdinand! Good heart,"
3786,_ALMEH._,What noise of battle. Pray God he be not there.
3787,_ALMEH._,Against my sire now I pray God: I pray      2223
3788,_ALMEH._,Our men be driven back: yet not too soon.
3789,_ALMEH._,Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Heaven grant there’s none
3790,_ALMEH._,To hear but he: and he will never hear me
3791,_ALMEH._,"Calling so fearfully, so faintly.... Alas!"
3792,_ALMEH._,"Better to seek him. Since he is not within,"
3793,_ALMEH._,He must be in this garden. He will have sought
3794,_ALMEH._,Some shelter from the night.—Ah! the arbour ...
3795,_ALMEH._,there....                  [_Goes to arbour._
3796,_ALMEH._,"Why, here. Wake, Ferdinand, wake! Come, ’tis I,"
3797,_ALMEH._,"We may escape. Come. Nay, this cannot be."
3798,_ALMEH._,"Ah, God!—not this. Have pity; undo it, revoke;"
3799,_ALMEH._,O let thy hand for once undo.
3800,_ALMEH._,"Thou mightest, O Thou mightest. Ah, how cold."
3801,_ALMEH._,"Oh! oh! he is murdered. Blood, his blood. ’Tis true."
3802,_ALMEH._,"Dead, and my dream, my fate, my love; ’tis done."
3803,_ALMEH._,"The end. Nay, God, as Thou art God, I trust Thee;"
3804,_ALMEH._,Take me with him. Here in this bower of death
3805,_ALMEH._,"I leave my body,—to this pitiless world      2240"
3806,_ALMEH._,Of hate: and to thy peaceful shores of joy
3807,_ALMEH._,I arise. O Ferdinand! me thou didst love.
3808,_ALMEH._,"Thou didst kiss, once ... and these thy lips so cold"

4140,RICARDO.,RICARDO.
4141,RICARDO.,
4142,RICARDO.,"I do, and hope some day"
4143,RICARDO.,It may be in my good fortune to repay you
4144,RICARDO.,For such a favour.
4145,RICARDO.,
4146,RICARDO.,_F._             Favour! what a word
4147,RICARDO.,To an old friend!
4148,RICARDO.,
4149,RICARDO.,"_R._            Nay, do not misconstrue me."
4150,RICARDO.,
4151,RICARDO.,"_F._ I own I am jealous, Richard, of the time"
4152,RICARDO.,We have lived apart. There was a touch of fear      10
4153,RICARDO.,"Mixed with my joy, when you broke in upon me"
4154,RICARDO.,"This morning, that the ten years had not spared me."
4155,RICARDO.,"You find me changed? Say, doth my countenance"
4156,RICARDO.,Wear the smug livery of the world?
4157,RICARDO.,
4158,RICARDO.,"_R._                             Nay, friend;"
4159,RICARDO.,I see no trace of that.
4160,RICARDO.,
4161,RICARDO.,_F._                  Then I remember
4162,RICARDO.,While I have played you have been within the mill:
4163,RICARDO.,And should I beat your coat there must fly out
4164,RICARDO.,"Clouds of that dusty, damned experience."
4165,RICARDO.,"Is not that so, your grace?"
4166,RICARDO.,
4167,RICARDO.,"_R._                      Go on: provoke me,"
4168,RICARDO.,As you were wont.      20
4169,RICARDO.,
4170,RICARDO.,"_F._            The best remembrance, Richard,"
4171,RICARDO.,Drowns in the world: and how should college days
4172,RICARDO.,Live in your memory as they do in mine?
4173,RICARDO.,’Tis no such lustre to your brilliant life
4174,RICARDO.,That we were comrades in Utopia;
4175,RICARDO.,"That commonwealth of study and idleness,"
4176,RICARDO.,"Where sport, adventure, poetry and music"
4177,RICARDO.,"Were sauced with virgin-juice, a dish for gods."
4178,RICARDO.,
4179,RICARDO.,_R._ As if I could forget!
4180,RICARDO.,
4181,RICARDO.,"_F._                     Ay, but the spirit!"
4182,RICARDO.,Think you we should have spoken of favours then?
4183,RICARDO.,"In those days, Richard, we were used to think      30"
4184,RICARDO.,Our teachers never had tasted life like ours;
4185,RICARDO.,Their staid propriety not logically
4186,RICARDO.,Deducible from essences as fresh
4187,RICARDO.,As angels of the sunrise. Shall the boys
4188,RICARDO.,Now say the same of us? By heaven you fright me:
4189,RICARDO.,The heart of manhood not to outlive a dog!
4190,RICARDO.,Then my old grudge against you.
4191,RICARDO.,
4192,RICARDO.,_R._                          What was that?
4193,RICARDO.,
4194,RICARDO.,"_F._ Your rank, which first drew us apart: but now"
4195,RICARDO.,To meet again and have you in my debt
4196,RICARDO.,"Is favour, by your leave, above repayment.      40"
4197,RICARDO.,
4198,RICARDO.,_R._ Still as proud as a peacock.
4199,RICARDO.,
4200,RICARDO.,_F._                            Could I do you a service.
4201,RICARDO.,"But can I? See, I am here the Countess’secretary:"
4202,RICARDO.,To make believe that you are a stranger to me
4203,RICARDO.,Were breach of trust.
4204,RICARDO.,
4205,RICARDO.,_R._                But love makes tricks of crimes.
4206,RICARDO.,
4207,RICARDO.,"_F._ And if she has often seen you, how suppose"
4208,RICARDO.,She will not know you?
4209,RICARDO.,
4210,RICARDO.,_R._                 ’Tis so long ago
4211,RICARDO.,That now in my disguise I have no fear.
4212,RICARDO.,You did not know me.
4213,RICARDO.,
4214,RICARDO.,_F._               That was but your beard.
4215,RICARDO.,
4216,RICARDO.,_R._ She hath not seen my beard: and ’tis impossible
4217,RICARDO.,She should suspect. She has treated me all along      50
4218,RICARDO.,"With such disdain, that I, in love as I am,"
4219,RICARDO.,Can scarce believe I venture; but—I am mad.
4220,RICARDO.,"Nothing could keep me back. Hear all my story,"
4221,RICARDO.,And then see how I am changed. ’Tis three years since
4222,RICARDO.,I saw her first at Rome. His Holiness
4223,RICARDO.,Gave a reception; I with some of the guests
4224,RICARDO.,Had strayed to view the galleries: suddenly
4225,RICARDO.,"Out of a group before me—as if a Grace,"
4226,RICARDO.,"That lived in Rafael’s brain to mock his hand,"
4227,RICARDO.,Had stepped alive amongst us to rebuke      60
4228,RICARDO.,Our admiration of the fresco-stuff—
4229,RICARDO.,She turned and faced me.
4230,RICARDO.,"Quick as I tell, I read my fate: I knew"
4231,RICARDO.,What I was born for. Love’s first ecstasy
4232,RICARDO.,Fooled me to a false security. That night
4233,RICARDO.,I wrote my passion; and by such presumption
4234,RICARDO.,"Offended. My after patience met with scorn,"
4235,RICARDO.,"My importunity anger. I then desisted,"
4236,RICARDO.,Trying if by absence I could work my cure.
4237,RICARDO.,Twelve months of trial bring me here to-day      70
4238,RICARDO.,With no hope left but this; that living near her
4239,RICARDO.,Her daily and familiar sight may blunt
4240,RICARDO.,My strained ideal passion; or if this
4241,RICARDO.,"Quench not my fancy, it may serve to feed it"
4242,RICARDO.,With something tangible and wholesomer
4243,RICARDO.,Than the day dreams of sick imagination.
4244,RICARDO.,
4245,RICARDO.,"_F._ I wish your cure; for, to say truth, the Countess"
4246,RICARDO.,Is somewhat odd; as you will see yourself.
4247,RICARDO.,
4248,RICARDO.,"_R._ ’Tis for my cure I come.—Your servant there,"
4249,RICARDO.,Might he not hear us?
4250,RICARDO.,
4251,RICARDO.,"_F._ (_to T._).     Tristram, just look round      80"
4252,RICARDO.,If you can see the Countess.
4253,RICARDO.,
4254,RICARDO.,"_TRISTRAM_ (_aside, going_)."
4255,RICARDO.,
4256,RICARDO.,What is there here now that I may not know?
4257,RICARDO.,That I am sent off? Who can this stranger be
4258,RICARDO.,So suddenly familiar with my master?
4259,RICARDO.,And comes here for his cure! Here to this haunt
4260,RICARDO.,Of women and lunatics! I’ll find him out.
4261,RICARDO.,
4262,RICARDO.,[_Exit singing to himself._
4263,RICARDO.,
4264,RICARDO.,_F._ My man is trusty and dull; devoted to me.
4265,RICARDO.,
4266,RICARDO.,"_R._ Excuse my caution: if we were overheard,—"
4267,RICARDO.,"If any guessed I were the Duke of Milan,"
4268,RICARDO.,The venture which I make would be my ruin:      90
4269,RICARDO.,All that I ask is secrecy. In this letter
4270,RICARDO.,"I have written the Countess from myself, as Duke,"
4271,RICARDO.,"Recommendation of myself, the bearer,"
4272,RICARDO.,"As one Ricardo, begging for the same"
4273,RICARDO.,Protection in her court for some few days.
4274,RICARDO.,Present me as a stranger: had I been such
4275,RICARDO.,You could not have refused.
4276,RICARDO.,
4277,RICARDO.,_F._                      Trust me to serve you:
4278,RICARDO.,But give your letter to the major-domo:
4279,RICARDO.,He attends her in the grounds; when they come by
4280,RICARDO.,I’ll point him out. Better know nought of me.      100
4281,RICARDO.,What think you of the gardens?
4282,RICARDO.,
4283,RICARDO.,_R._                         All this hour
4284,RICARDO.,I have seemed in Paradise: and the fair prospect
4285,RICARDO.,Hath quieted my spirit: I think I sail
4286,RICARDO.,Into the windless haven of my life
4287,RICARDO.,To-day with happy omens: as the stir
4288,RICARDO.,And sleep-forbidding rattle of the journey
4289,RICARDO.,Was like my life till now. Here all is peace:
4290,RICARDO.,"The still fresh air of this October morning,"
4291,RICARDO.,With its resigning odours; the rich hues
4292,RICARDO.,Wherein the gay leaves revel to their fall;      110
4293,RICARDO.,"The deep blue sky; the misty distances,"
4294,RICARDO.,And splashing fountains; and I thought I heard
4295,RICARDO.,A magic service of meandering music
4296,RICARDO.,Threading the glades and stealing on the lawns.
4297,RICARDO.,Was I mistaken?
4298,RICARDO.,
4299,RICARDO.,"_Re-enter Tristram unperceived; he stands by listening at back, as if"
4300,RICARDO.,waiting to be observed._
4301,RICARDO.,
4302,RICARDO.,"_F._          Nay, nay: there was music."
4303,RICARDO.,But why the jocund morn so dissolutely
4304,RICARDO.,Forestalls the faint and lulling charms of eve
4305,RICARDO.,"I must explain. The Countess, whom you court,"
4306,RICARDO.,Hath an unwholesome temper; what its nature
4307,RICARDO.,"You, when you have seen it, will be as like to guess"
4308,RICARDO.,As any other. She hath a restless spirit      121
4309,RICARDO.,"And eager; and, what seems a sign of note,"
4310,RICARDO.,Suffers from jealousy without a cause.
4311,RICARDO.,"She is full of fancies; and hath, like a school-girl,"
4312,RICARDO.,"Drawn up a code of her peculiar notions,"
4313,RICARDO.,"Whereby, in place of commonsense and manners,"
4314,RICARDO.,She rules her petty court with tyrannies
4315,RICARDO.,"Of fine and forfeit. Then, although she lives"
4316,RICARDO.,"Pampered with luxury, and hath a sense"
4317,RICARDO.,"O’ergreedy of all that’s offered, yet she takes      130"
4318,RICARDO.,"Her pleasure feverously, and pines in plenty."
4319,RICARDO.,’Tis a derangement:—the music which you heard
4320,RICARDO.,Was a diversion of my own contrivance
4321,RICARDO.,To pass the hour: the evil spirit within her
4322,RICARDO.,Yields most to music.
4323,RICARDO.,
4324,RICARDO.,_R._                What you say is strange.
4325,RICARDO.,
4326,RICARDO.,
4327,RICARDO.,_F._ ’Tis unaccountable.
4328,RICARDO.,
4329,RICARDO.,"_T._ (_coming forward_). And so you’d say,"
4330,RICARDO.,Knew you the cause.
4331,RICARDO.,
4332,RICARDO.,_F._              Tristram!
4333,RICARDO.,
4334,RICARDO.,_R._ (_aside_).           Now damn this fellow.
4335,RICARDO.,"(_To T._) Perhaps you know it, sir?"
4336,RICARDO.,
4337,RICARDO.,"_T._                              I know it, yes:"
4338,RICARDO.,But may not speak.
4339,RICARDO.,
4340,RICARDO.,_F._             I bid you speak and show
4341,RICARDO.,My friend your wisdom.
4342,RICARDO.,
4343,RICARDO.,_T._                 To your secrets then      140
4344,RICARDO.,Add this. The Countess is in love.
4345,RICARDO.,
4346,RICARDO.,_R. and F._                      In love!
4347,RICARDO.,
4348,RICARDO.,_T._ In love.
4349,RICARDO.,
4350,RICARDO.,_R. and F._   With whom?
4351,RICARDO.,
4352,RICARDO.,_T._                   With whom....
4353,RICARDO.,
4354,RICARDO.,_R._                               But say with whom.
4355,RICARDO.,
4356,RICARDO.,_T._ Stay. I will say with whom.
4357,RICARDO.,’Tis one to whom she dare not make avowal.
4358,RICARDO.,
4359,RICARDO.,_F._ Say whom you mean.
4360,RICARDO.,
4361,RICARDO.,"_T._                  Why, who but me!"
4362,RICARDO.,
4363,RICARDO.,_F._                                 The fool!
4364,RICARDO.,We wish not for your jests. Where is the Countess?
4365,RICARDO.,
4366,RICARDO.,"_T._ She is coming by the lake, sir."
4367,RICARDO.,
4368,RICARDO.,"_F._                               Stand aside,"
4369,RICARDO.,We have business now.
4370,RICARDO.,
4371,RICARDO.,"_T._ (_aside, going_). The fish bite very well:"
4372,RICARDO.,I hooked them both at first cast of my fly.
4373,RICARDO.,
4374,RICARDO.,(_Sings to himself._)
4375,RICARDO.,
4376,RICARDO.,"_F._ ’Twould make us brothers, Richard."
4377,RICARDO.,
4378,RICARDO.,_R._ Brothers?—how? 150
4379,RICARDO.,
4380,RICARDO.,"_F._ Having your secret, I must give you mine."
4381,RICARDO.,"I also love a lady in the court,"
4382,RICARDO.,"Secretly too, as you, though with success;"
4383,RICARDO.,And she is foster-sister to your lady.
4384,RICARDO.,The prudery with which the Countess rules
4385,RICARDO.,Drave us to hide our liking at the first;
4386,RICARDO.,"And as that grew, deception still kept pace,"
4387,RICARDO.,Enhancing the romance of our delight
4388,RICARDO.,With stolen intercourse. But these last days
4389,RICARDO.,"A cloud hath risen: for the lady’s father, 160"
4390,RICARDO.,"(That’s the old major-domo, whom I spoke of,)"
4391,RICARDO.,Hath been befooled to give his daughter away
4392,RICARDO.,"To a wreathed ass, a cousin of the Countess,"
4393,RICARDO.,Who hath herself approved the match. You find me
4394,RICARDO.,"In this dilemma, whether to confess"
4395,RICARDO.,"My love for Laura,—that’s the lady’s name—"
4396,RICARDO.,"Braving the Countess’anger, or carry her off,"
4397,RICARDO.,And after sue for favour. (_Music heard._)
4398,RICARDO.,Hark! here they come.
4399,RICARDO.,I’ll tell you more hereafter.
4400,RICARDO.,
4401,RICARDO.,"_R._ Ay, do: but now"
4402,RICARDO.,"Forget not me. (_Aside._) By Jove, he has capped my story.— 170"
4403,RICARDO.,Diana’s sister too: and I entrapped
4404,RICARDO.,To aid in her elopement.
4405,RICARDO.,
4406,RICARDO.,"_Enter Diana, Laura, Gregory, and St. Nicholas; with attendant"

4436,_DIANA._,Who wove that strain. The verses too were fetched
4437,_DIANA._,Out of a deeper well than common passion
4438,_DIANA._,"Hath skill to draw from. Frederick, who is the poet"
4439,_DIANA._,That I must love for this?
4440,_DIANA._,
4441,_DIANA._,_F._                     Love for my art      191
4442,_DIANA._,Hath made your ladyship too generous
4443,_DIANA._,Towards a most humble workman. ’Tis my own.
4444,_DIANA._,
4445,_DIANA._,"_D._ Ah me! what must it be to be a poet,"
4446,_DIANA._,"And in the abandoned humour that men take with,"
4447,_DIANA._,"To give forth! O ’tis godlike! but the music,—"
4448,_DIANA._,’Tis that you excel in: it hath a melancholy
4449,_DIANA._,Which springs of love.
4450,_DIANA._,
4451,_DIANA._,_F._                 The whole world sprang of love;
4452,_DIANA._,And art is but the praise the creature makes
4453,_DIANA._,To the Creator.
4454,_DIANA._,
4455,_DIANA._,_D._          True: and the best praise      200
4456,_DIANA._,Is but love’s echo. I mean you love some lady.
4457,_DIANA._,She is very happy. Would I knew her name.
4458,_DIANA._,
4459,_DIANA._,"_F._ When I shall love a lady, and have means"
4460,_DIANA._,"To court her, you shall hear gay music."
4461,_DIANA._,
4462,_DIANA._,_D._                                  Means!
4463,_DIANA._,Is she so mercenary?
4464,_DIANA._,
4465,_DIANA._,_F._               Your ladyship
4466,_DIANA._,Must take this lady of your own creation
4467,_DIANA._,With all her faults. Love is a luxury
4468,_DIANA._,You may suspect in me when I have money
4469,_DIANA._,To spend in presents.
4470,_DIANA._,
4471,_DIANA._,_D._                Whom you love I know not:
4472,_DIANA._,"But whether it be a queen or peasant girl,      210"
4473,_DIANA._,’Tis all one. Love exalteth above rank

4483,_GREGORY._,A hundred ducats at my household charge.
4484,_GREGORY._,
4485,_GREGORY._,_G._ (_to F._). What said my lady?
4486,_GREGORY._,
4487,_GREGORY._,_F._ (_aside_). An open insult.
4488,_GREGORY._,

4490,_GREGORY._,A hundred ducats for a wherewithal
4491,_GREGORY._,To make his lady presents.
4492,_GREGORY._,
4493,_GREGORY._,"_F._ (_to T._).          Silence, idiot."
4494,_GREGORY._,

4496,_GREGORY._,

4512,_GREGORY._,
4513,_GREGORY._,"_R._ I bring the letter, madam: and ’tis writ"
4514,_GREGORY._,But in my favour.
4515,_GREGORY._,
4516,_GREGORY._,_D._            Good: on that assurance

4552,_GREGORY._,
4553,_GREGORY._,"_N._                 Yes, when it falls.      240"
4554,_GREGORY._,
4555,_GREGORY._,"_F._ How so? When heaven doth rain, it rains for all."
4556,_GREGORY._,Thou shouldst have picked it up.
4557,_GREGORY._,
4558,_GREGORY._,"_N._                           I ran to do so,"

4560,_GREGORY._,"Give’t me, that I restore it to my lady."
4561,_GREGORY._,
4562,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Claim not her gloves, sir, till her gloves are thine."

4566,_GREGORY._,A question.

4568,_GREGORY._,_G._      Eigh!
4569,_GREGORY._,
4570,_GREGORY._,"_D._          What is this, St. Nicholas?"
4571,_GREGORY._,
4572,_GREGORY._,_N._ I beg Sir Gregory judge ’twixt me and Frederick.
4573,_GREGORY._,"My lady Laura, having dropped her glove,"
4574,_GREGORY._,"He picks it up, and would return it to her;      250"
4575,_GREGORY._,"Which I forbid, claiming the privilege"
4576,_GREGORY._,As her accepted lover.
4577,_GREGORY._,
4578,_GREGORY._,_D._                 A mighty question.
4579,_GREGORY._,Who can determine it?
4580,_GREGORY._,
4581,_GREGORY._,_T._                That can I. The lady
4582,_GREGORY._,"Should drop the other, and let each have one."
4583,_GREGORY._,
4584,_GREGORY._,"_D._ St. Nicholas would claim both, Sir Solomon."
4585,_GREGORY._,(_To F._). Give me the glove. I thank you much; and now
4586,_GREGORY._,I offer better matter for discussion:
4587,_GREGORY._,The chairs were set on purpose. Let all be seated.
4588,_GREGORY._,"Laura, take back thy glove; and sit thou there.      259"
4589,_GREGORY._,"You, Frederick, on my right. (_To R._) ’Tis what I call"
4590,_GREGORY._,"The Muses’matinée. These morning hours,"
4591,_GREGORY._,"Which others waste, we may devote to wisdom,"
4592,_GREGORY._,"And solve some learned question, as was done"
4593,_GREGORY._,"In ancient Athens; where, as Plato shows,"
4594,_GREGORY._,Nothing was more admired than dialogues
4595,_GREGORY._,In science and philosophy. I will hold
4596,_GREGORY._,Such an assembly: we will each in turn
4597,_GREGORY._,Make answer to the question I propose.
4598,_GREGORY._,And that shall be of love. I’ll question why
4599,_GREGORY._,Love is called bitter-sweet.

4737,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"_G._                           Oh, is’t my turn?"
4738,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,The chiefest pain of love; I am asked to say
4739,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,What that is?
4740,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4741,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,_D._        Yes.
4742,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4743,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,_G._           Your ladyship knows well
4744,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,You ask of one who has lived to study truth
4745,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,From nature’s only teacher;—without which
4746,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,I would not speak. But since you have often heard
4747,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,Your sainted mother tell from what sad cause      361
4748,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"She made my Laura your adopted sister,"
4749,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,Saving my orphan in the only loss
4750,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"That can befall a babe, its mother’s care,"
4751,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,You know how by that loss there came to me
4752,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"The chiefest pain of love; which can, I think,"
4753,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"But hap to wedded spirits, who have joyed"
4754,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"In mutual life: wherein, may heaven forgive me"
4755,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,If the remembrance of my joy awake
4756,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"Sorrow with thankfulness, the balance being      370"
4757,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"So far on the good side, spite of the pain:"
4758,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,Yet if I speak of it now without more tears
4759,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"Than ye can see, ’tis that the founts are dried:"
4760,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,Time hath not helped me otherwise. I pray
4761,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"God, who is merciful, to shield all here"
4762,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,From like calamity.
4763,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4764,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,_F._              I say Amen
4765,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,To good Sir Gregory.
4766,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4767,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,_R._               And amen for me.
4768,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4769,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,_Enter Flora to D._
4770,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4771,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,"_D._ What is it, Flora?"
4772,_GREGORY_                  _RICHARD_,
4773,_FLORA._,_FLORA._
4774,_FLORA._,
4775,_FLORA._,"My lady, the merchant’s come."
4776,_FLORA._,
4777,_FLORA._,_D._ What merchant?
4778,_FLORA._,
4779,_FLORA._,_Fl._             The Venetian with the silks
4780,_FLORA._,Your ladyship bespoke.
4781,_FLORA._,
4782,_FLORA._,"_D._ (_rising_).     Do you hear, Laura?      380"
4783,_FLORA._,"Your stuffs at last. Our matinée, my friends,"
4784,_FLORA._,"Is interrupted, an important matter"
4785,_FLORA._,"Unfortunately calls me away. Come, Laura:"
4786,_FLORA._,There’ll scarce be time to get the silks made up
4787,_FLORA._,Before your wedding. Come and choose them with me.
4788,_FLORA._,"St. Nicholas, we shall need thee too; ’tis nothing"
4789,_FLORA._,Unless thine eye is pleased.
4790,_FLORA._,
4791,_FLORA._,_N._                       I dote on silks.
4792,_FLORA._,I love their fine prismatic cadences.
4793,_FLORA._,Yet these Venetian colours to my taste
4794,_FLORA._,Are over-saturate: I’d have them cast      390
4795,_FLORA._,With the Doge’s ring in the sea. A good year’s soaking
4796,_FLORA._,"Would bring them down into that faded softness,"
4797,_FLORA._,Which is a banquet to the cultured eye.
4798,_FLORA._,
4799,_FLORA._,"_D._ Ricardo, do you attend Sir Gregory,"
4800,_FLORA._,"And see your lodging. Come, St. Nicholas;"
4801,_FLORA._,"Come, Laura!     [_Exit with Laura and St. Nicholas. Flora following._"
4802,_FLORA._,
4803,_FLORA._,"_G._ (_to R._). I wait upon you, if it please you"
4804,_FLORA._,To visit your apartments. Tell me pray
4805,_FLORA._,What men you bring.      [_Exit with R. making signs._
4806,_FLORA._,
4807,_FLORA._,_F._ (_taking out the glove with the letter_). Thank
4808,_FLORA._,"heaven, now I may read."
4809,_FLORA._,(_Aside._) What saith my love? what hope?
4810,_FLORA._,
4811,_FLORA._,_T._ (_aside_).                   Another letter!
4812,_FLORA._,Whence got he this?
4813,_FLORA._,
4814,_FLORA._,_F._              O blessed paper!
4815,_FLORA._,
4816,_FLORA._,_T._ (_aside_).                  Watch him!      400
4817,_FLORA._,
4818,_FLORA._,"_F._ (_reading, away from T._). _Dearest; all is lost."
4819,_FLORA._,They mistake my hesitation for consent. My father has
4820,_FLORA._,fixed the marriage for three days hence. I dared not
4821,_FLORA._,say the truth. I know not what I said. My senses
4822,_FLORA._,left me...._
4823,_FLORA._,
4824,_FLORA._,(_Aloud._)  Death! death!
4825,_FLORA._,
4826,_FLORA._,"_T._ (_aside_). By Gemini, this is a nasty one."
4827,_FLORA._,
4828,_FLORA._,_F._ (_reading as before_). _But be sure I never consented.
4829,_FLORA._,"If there is no other escape, I must fly. Come to-night"
4830,_FLORA._,to the garden. I will be at my window at eleven
4831,_FLORA._,o’clock._      410
4832,_FLORA._,
4833,_FLORA._,"(_Aloud._) Thank God, thank God. I breathe again."
4834,_FLORA._,I shall see thee to-night.
4835,_FLORA._,
4836,_FLORA._,"_T._ Pray, sir,"
4837,_FLORA._,Is anything the matter?
4838,_FLORA._,
4839,_FLORA._,_F._                  Eh! ah! what said I?
4840,_FLORA._,
4841,_FLORA._,"_T._ That you were dead, and then alive again."
4842,_FLORA._,
4843,_FLORA._,_F._ ’Tis true.
4844,_FLORA._,
4845,_FLORA._,_T._          I quite believe it. And then you said
4846,_FLORA._,That you would see her to-night.
4847,_FLORA._,
4848,_FLORA._,"_F._ Pray mind your business, Tristram:"
4849,_FLORA._,"Pay more attention to what is said to you,"
4850,_FLORA._,And less to what is not. Whom would you speak of?
4851,_FLORA._,
4852,_FLORA._,"_T._ I speak of no one, sir.      421"
4853,_FLORA._,
4854,_FLORA._,_F._                       No more do I.      [_Exit._
4855,_FLORA._,
4856,_FLORA._,"_T._ My master’s mad. If this is court life, I shall"
4857,_FLORA._,"soon curse my birthday, like dutiful Job. ’Tis a madhouse."
4858,_FLORA._,If there were any sense in anything that’s said
4859,_FLORA._,"or done, I’d swear my life that the Countess was in"
4860,_FLORA._,"love with my master, and he might have her for the"
4861,_FLORA._,"asking. Yet who can tell what she means, when every"
4862,_FLORA._,one plays at being in love with somebody? ’Tis a
4863,_FLORA._,fashion with them as catching as the measles. My
4864,_FLORA._,"constitution holds out, thank heaven.      (_Sings._)"
4865,_FLORA._,
4866,_FLORA._,"The meads drink up the rain,      430"
4867,_FLORA._,"The kine eat up the grass,"
4868,_FLORA._,"And man feeds on the kine,"
4869,_FLORA._,"And love on man, alas."
4870,_FLORA._,"So about and about! fa, la!"
4871,_FLORA._,
4872,_FLORA._,"And there’s a good light step to that tune, which I"
4873,_FLORA._,think I can do as well as any I have seen. (_Dances and sings._)
4874,_FLORA._,
4875,_FLORA._,"So about and about! fa, la!"
4876,_FLORA._,"So about and about! fa, la! etc."
4877,_FLORA._,
4878,_FLORA._,"_Re-enter Flora, who watches him awhile and then laughs"
4879,_FLORA._,aloud._
4880,_FLORA._,
4881,_FLORA._,_Fl._ Ha! ha!      440
4882,_FLORA._,"Well fancy, Tristram! dancing all alone!"
4883,_FLORA._,
4884,_FLORA._,_T._ Lack of company constrains a man to be alone;
4885,_FLORA._,"and as for dancing, ’tis the original sin Adam was"
4886,_FLORA._,born with. ’Twas seeing him dance alone provoked
4887,_FLORA._,providence to send him a partner. ’Tis now the
4888,_FLORA._,inheritance of lambs and such innocents: and wert
4889,_FLORA._,"thou not too depraved by a court life, I would ask"
4890,_FLORA._,thee to dance with me.
4891,_FLORA._,
4892,_FLORA._,_Fl._ I depraved! I will dance with you.
4893,_FLORA._,
4894,_FLORA._,_T._ Canst thou?      450
4895,_FLORA._,
4896,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ Ha! ha! About and about, fa, la! (_Dancing._)"
4897,_FLORA._,
4898,_FLORA._,(_They dance to each other and then together; in and out among the
4899,_FLORA._,chairs._)
4900,_FLORA._,
4901,_FLORA._,"O softly, Tristram, softly; I am out of breath."
4902,_FLORA._,
4903,_FLORA._,_T._ You are not so depraved as I thought. Here’s
4904,_FLORA._,the coin I pay in. (_Kissing her._)
4905,_FLORA._,
4906,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ I don’t like you, Tristram. You take"
4907,_FLORA._,more liberties in a day than others would in a month.
4908,_FLORA._,
4909,_FLORA._,_T._ Ah! ah! Oh wala! wala! (_Puts his finger to
4910,_FLORA._,his head._)
4911,_FLORA._,
4912,_FLORA._,_Fl._ What is it? Are you giddy?
4913,_FLORA._,
4914,_FLORA._,"_T._ No, no. My constitution—my system."
4915,_FLORA._,
4916,_FLORA._,_Fl._ What?      460
4917,_FLORA._,
4918,_FLORA._,_T._ I’m going mad like the rest of them. I’ve caught
4919,_FLORA._,it too.
4920,_FLORA._,
4921,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ Don’t talk so; to frighten me, Tristram, like"
4922,_FLORA._,that. What do you mean?
4923,_FLORA._,
4924,_FLORA._,"_T._ Well, we shall make a better pair than two I know."
4925,_FLORA._,
4926,_FLORA._,_Fl._ I never promised. And what would my lady
4927,_FLORA._,say? And—oh! I forgot: she sent me to fetch you.
4928,_FLORA._,
4929,_FLORA._,_T._ My lady?—me?
4930,_FLORA._,
4931,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ Yes, you.      470"
4932,_FLORA._,
4933,_FLORA._,_T._ She sent for me?
4934,_FLORA._,
4935,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ No sooner was she come in the house, than"
4936,_FLORA._,"as she sat looking on the silks, one of her fits took"
4937,_FLORA._,"her, and I thought she would faint: when suddenly"
4938,_FLORA._,"she got up, and bade me go out and seek for you. See,"
4939,_FLORA._,here she comes.
4940,_FLORA._,
4941,_FLORA._,_T._ What can she need with me? (_Aside._) If she
4942,_FLORA._,"has got wind of me and Flora, it’s all up."
4943,_FLORA._,
4944,_FLORA._,_Re-enter Diana._
4945,_FLORA._,
4946,_FLORA._,"_D._ (_to Fl._). I see you have found him, Flora."
4947,_FLORA._,
4948,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ We were coming, my lady, as fast as we could."
4949,_FLORA._,
4950,_FLORA._,_D._ Leave us alone.      [_Exit Flora._      481
4951,_FLORA._,Good Tristram; will you serve me?
4952,_FLORA._,
4953,_FLORA._,"_T._ Certainly, my lady. My lady has only to command."
4954,_FLORA._,
4955,_FLORA._,_D._ But in a matter where your duty might seem
4956,_FLORA._,opposed to my interest.
4957,_FLORA._,
4958,_FLORA._,"_T._ ’Tis impossible, my lady, that my duties could"
4959,_FLORA._,be opposed to my lady’s.
4960,_FLORA._,
4961,_FLORA._,"_D._ I think, Tristram, that you know a secret which"
4962,_FLORA._,concerns me.
4963,_FLORA._,
4964,_FLORA._,"_T._ I assure your ladyship, upon my oath...."
4965,_FLORA._,
4966,_FLORA._,_D._ Stay now. Take this purse....
4967,_FLORA._,
4968,_FLORA._,_T._ I thank your ladyship.
4969,_FLORA._,
4970,_FLORA._,_D._ To convince you of my goodwill. Now I have
4971,_FLORA._,a suspicion: and whether or no you help me to come
4972,_FLORA._,"at the truth, I shall learn it. I will not have secrets"
4973,_FLORA._,kept from me in my court.
4974,_FLORA._,
4975,_FLORA._,"_T._ Certainly not, my lady. But I pray your ladyship"
4976,_FLORA._,"to speak plainly, for I am a simple man; and if"
4977,_FLORA._,"I am to assist your ladyship, I must understand your"
4978,_FLORA._,ladyship.      502
4979,_FLORA._,
4980,_FLORA._,"_D._ You are a very sensible servant, Tristram."
4981,_FLORA._,"Tell me then, do you not know of some one in the"
4982,_FLORA._,"court, who carries on a love-affair behind my back?"
4983,_FLORA._,
4984,_FLORA._,"_T._ (_aside_). It’s me.—No, my lady: I do not. It is"
4985,_FLORA._,impossible that any one should do such a thing.
4986,_FLORA._,
4987,_FLORA._,_D._ Is not your master in love?
4988,_FLORA._,
4989,_FLORA._,_T._ Oh!... my master? Certainly; not a doubt
4990,_FLORA._,of it.
4991,_FLORA._,
4992,_FLORA._,"_D._ So I thought. Now you must tell me, good"
4993,_FLORA._,"Tristram, with whom he is in love."
4994,_FLORA._,
4995,_FLORA._,"_T._ If that’s the question, my lady, you may take"
4996,_FLORA._,back the purse again. Take it; I thought it was not
4997,_FLORA._,like my luck.
4998,_FLORA._,
4999,_FLORA._,_D._ You will not tell?
5000,_FLORA._,
5001,_FLORA._,"_T._ I cannot tell what I do not know, my lady."
5002,_FLORA._,
5003,_FLORA._,_D._ You do not know?
5004,_FLORA._,
5005,_FLORA._,_T._ I have not an inclination.      520
5006,_FLORA._,
5007,_FLORA._,_D._ Stay yet. You shall keep the purse if you will
5008,_FLORA._,do your best to discover who she is.
5009,_FLORA._,
5010,_FLORA._,"_T._ Your ladyship is very fair (_pocketing_), and I thank your"
5011,_FLORA._,ladyship for restoring my confidence.
5012,_FLORA._,
5013,_FLORA._,_D._ Then tell me first. You say you know that your master is in love.
5014,_FLORA._,
5015,_FLORA._,_T._ Certainly; as much or more than all the court.
5016,_FLORA._,
5017,_FLORA._,_D._ All the court!
5018,_FLORA._,
5019,_FLORA._,_T._ Except your ladyship ... I beg your ladyship’s
5020,_FLORA._,pardon.      530
5021,_FLORA._,
5022,_FLORA._,_D._ Except me?
5023,_FLORA._,
5024,_FLORA._,_T._ And me.
5025,_FLORA._,
5026,_FLORA._,_D._ And you?
5027,_FLORA._,
5028,_FLORA._,"_T._ And old Sir Gregory, I may say."
5029,_FLORA._,
5030,_FLORA._,"_D._ Please, Tristram, keep to the matter. By what"
5031,_FLORA._,signs know you that your master is in love?
5032,_FLORA._,
5033,_FLORA._,_T._ First because he talks nonsense aloud to himself;
5034,_FLORA._,then he reads and writes so many letters.
5035,_FLORA._,
5036,_FLORA._,"_D._ Letters, you say!      539"
5037,_FLORA._,
5038,_FLORA._,"_T._ Certainly. Why, the moment that you left,"
5039,_FLORA._,He pulled one out and read it to himself.
5040,_FLORA._,"And now I am dead, he says, and now I live;"
5041,_FLORA._,And all the rest of it.
5042,_FLORA._,
5043,_FLORA._,_D._                  I must know from whom
5044,_FLORA._,That letter came.
5045,_FLORA._,
5046,_FLORA._,_T._            And that much I can tell.
5047,_FLORA._,"I saw him write it to himself, last night,"
5048,_FLORA._,"And put it in his pocket. To my knowledge,"
5049,_FLORA._,"He has never sent it, and received no other,"
5050,_FLORA._,"Nor spoke to a lady since;—when, on a sudden,"
5051,_FLORA._,"He whips it out, and reads it to himself"
5052,_FLORA._,"As if ’twere newly come. Then, off he goes,      550"
5053,_FLORA._,"Bragging, ’tis an appointment for to-night."
5054,_FLORA._,
5055,_FLORA._,_D._ To-night?
5056,_FLORA._,
5057,_FLORA._,"_T._         Ay, so he said. But he can’t hide"
5058,_FLORA._,"The truth from me. The fact is this, my lady;"
5059,_FLORA._,He makes believe. He sees that everybody
5060,_FLORA._,Is full of this same love: since ’tis the fashion
5061,_FLORA._,"He’d be ashamed, just for the lack of a lady,"
5062,_FLORA._,To come behind. But all the love he makes
5063,_FLORA._,Is to himself.
5064,_FLORA._,
5065,_FLORA._,"_D._         But if there were a lady,"
5066,_FLORA._,Think you she would be of the court?
5067,_FLORA._,
5068,_FLORA._,_T._                               Why certainly.
5069,_FLORA._,
5070,_FLORA._,_D._ How so?
5071,_FLORA._,
5072,_FLORA._,_T._       Because ’tis only in the court      560
5073,_FLORA._,That such ridiculous foolery would pass.
5074,_FLORA._,
5075,_FLORA._,"_D._ Stay. If he loved a lady of the court,"
5076,_FLORA._,I think I must have known her.
5077,_FLORA._,
5078,_FLORA._,_T._                         Very true.
5079,_FLORA._,"Your ladyship is right. If ’twere a lady,"
5080,_FLORA._,She could not be of the court.
5081,_FLORA._,
5082,_FLORA._,_D._                         Then we must look
5083,_FLORA._,To find her in the town.
5084,_FLORA._,
5085,_FLORA._,"_T._                   ’Tis very plain,"
5086,_FLORA._,"That if she is not in the court, she is in the town."
5087,_FLORA._,
5088,_FLORA._,"_D._ I have set you on the track. If you will serve me,"
5089,_FLORA._,Discover who this lady is: observe
5090,_FLORA._,Your master narrowly; above all to-night      570
5091,_FLORA._,"Follow him where’er he goes, watch all he does;"
5092,_FLORA._,And bring me word to-morrow. That’s the service
5093,_FLORA._,"For which, good Tristram, I will pay you well."
5094,_FLORA._,But can I trust you?
5095,_FLORA._,
5096,_FLORA._,"_T._ I never deceived any one, my lady: and if I"
5097,_FLORA._,"can discover my master’s secret, your ladyship shall"
5098,_FLORA._,"know it. I hold, like your ladyship, that love is a"
5099,_FLORA._,"most contemptible disease, from which a good servant"
5100,_FLORA._,should seek to deliver his master. But I don’t think
5101,_FLORA._,we shall find any lady.      580
5102,_FLORA._,
5103,_FLORA._,"_D._ No lady, no pay, Tristram; remember that:"
5104,_FLORA._,"And, above all, be secret. Now, go your way,"
5105,_FLORA._,And tell your master I wish to see him here.
5106,_FLORA._,
5107,_FLORA._,"_T._ I will, your ladyship. (_Aside._) And as for"
5108,_FLORA._,secrets—if you knew my master’s as well as I know
5109,_FLORA._,"yours, you would not need to take me into your pay."
5110,_FLORA._,
5111,_FLORA._,[_Exit._
5112,_FLORA._,
5113,_FLORA._,_D._ To-night: they meet to-night. It may be now
5114,_FLORA._,"That I am in time: maybe they have never met,"
5115,_FLORA._,At least not thus. It seems they have carried on
5116,_FLORA._,"The intrigue, so far, by letter, and now by letter      590"
5117,_FLORA._,They have made their assignation for to-night.
5118,_FLORA._,At last I have found out something ... it shall not
5119,_FLORA._,be ...
5120,_FLORA._,"Their first ... no, no: that I can hinder...."
5121,_FLORA._,I trust the clown: he could not frame a tale;
5122,_FLORA._,And what I gave him won him. Yet no guess
5123,_FLORA._,Who she should be. It tortures jealousy
5124,_FLORA._,To know so little: still where little is known
5125,_FLORA._,May little be. But Frederick doth not feign.
5126,_FLORA._,Nay if he feigned he would not hide it from me:
5127,_FLORA._,"And loved he not another, he would be      600"
5128,_FLORA._,More open to my meaning when I try him
5129,_FLORA._,With such unveilings of my inclination
5130,_FLORA._,"As make me blush alone. O perverse love,"
5131,_FLORA._,"At once triumphant and inscrutable,"
5132,_FLORA._,Palpable and impotent. What if he knows
5133,_FLORA._,"I love him, and yet loves me not, but loves"
5134,_FLORA._,"Another, a rival? But if he knows not,"
5135,_FLORA._,"And if he knew, might love—while there’s that hope,"
5136,_FLORA._,They shall not meet: so much I can ensure.
5137,_FLORA._,"I must be cruel to thee, my unknown foe:      610"
5138,_FLORA._,"Thou lookest to meet him, but he shall not come."
5139,_FLORA._,I’ll make him play thee false ... what vantage else
5140,_FLORA._,That he is my servant? I can send him off
5141,_FLORA._,Whither I will. Against this assignation
5142,_FLORA._,I’ll make an alibi. My plan is ready:
5143,_FLORA._,"I’ll send him away from Belflor. Here he comes,"
5144,_FLORA._,My enemy and my deity. If he quarrel
5145,_FLORA._,With my command he is guilty; a word will show.
5146,_FLORA._,
5147,_FLORA._,"_Re-enter Frederick, with some papers, ink, and pen._"
5148,_FLORA._,
5149,_FLORA._,_F._ Your ladyship sent for me.
5150,_FLORA._,
5151,_FLORA._,_D._                          What have you there?
5152,_FLORA._,
5153,_FLORA._,_F._ Some papers for your ladyship to sign.      620
5154,_FLORA._,
5155,_FLORA._,_D._ Set them down on the chair.
5156,_FLORA._,
5157,_FLORA._,_F._                           I have brought besides
5158,_FLORA._,The settlement for Lady Laura’s marriage.
5159,_FLORA._,
5160,_FLORA._,_D._ Thank you: ’tis time I had it. I cannot now
5161,_FLORA._,"Attend to business. I have a message, Frederick,"
5162,_FLORA._,"To send to Milan: it demands despatch,"
5163,_FLORA._,And you must bear it to-night.
5164,_FLORA._,
5165,_FLORA._,"_F._                         To-night, my lady!"
5166,_FLORA._,
5167,_FLORA._,_D._ To-night. Why not to-night?
5168,_FLORA._,
5169,_FLORA._,_F._                           No reason at all.
5170,_FLORA._,Except....
5171,_FLORA._,
5172,_FLORA._,_D._     Except what?
5173,_FLORA._,
5174,_FLORA._,_F._                  Since your ladyship
5175,_FLORA._,Well knows the full devotion which I lend
5176,_FLORA._,"To her affairs, I fear not to incur      630"
5177,_FLORA._,"Blame of remissness, if I beg for once"
5178,_FLORA._,To be excused this service.
5179,_FLORA._,
5180,_FLORA._,"_D._ (_aside_).           Ah, he is hit."
5181,_FLORA._,
5182,_FLORA._,_F._ I’d travel to the corners of the globe
5183,_FLORA._,To serve your ladyship: and in a journey
5184,_FLORA._,"So light as this, one that would never burden"
5185,_FLORA._,"The most unwilling servant, I can beg"
5186,_FLORA._,Without reproach that you will find for once
5187,_FLORA._,Another messenger.
5188,_FLORA._,
5189,_FLORA._,_D._             What then prevents you?
5190,_FLORA._,
5191,_FLORA._,_F._ Good cause enough; though ’tis not of a nature
5192,_FLORA._,To welcome question.
5193,_FLORA._,
5194,_FLORA._,"_D._               There’s no person, Frederick,"
5195,_FLORA._,"That more regards your health, nor more regrets      640"
5196,_FLORA._,Your slightest ailing than I do. I fear
5197,_FLORA._,You have done me wrong concealing from my knowledge
5198,_FLORA._,The true state of your health ... but if ’twas kindness
5199,_FLORA._,To spare me anxiety....
5200,_FLORA._,
5201,_FLORA._,"_F._                  I assure, my lady...."
5202,_FLORA._,
5203,_FLORA._,_D._ I have thought you looked of late careworn and pale.
5204,_FLORA._,
5205,_FLORA._,_F._ My health is excellent.
5206,_FLORA._,
5207,_FLORA._,_D._                       I am glad to hear it.
5208,_FLORA._,
5209,_FLORA._,_F._ The expression of your good will reassures me
5210,_FLORA._,Your ladyship will humour me.
5211,_FLORA._,
5212,_FLORA._,_D._                        And I would
5213,_FLORA._,"Most gladly, were it a matter that admitted"
5214,_FLORA._,A bearer of less trust. But as it stands      650
5215,_FLORA._,There’s nothing for it but your going to-night.
5216,_FLORA._,"You are out of sorts, Frederick: maybe the travelling"
5217,_FLORA._,"Is just the change you need. Give me that pen,"
5218,_FLORA._,I’ll write the letter at once. (_F. gives and D. writes._)
5219,_FLORA._,If you fear cold
5220,_FLORA._,You can close up the coach. The journey is short:
5221,_FLORA._,"’Twill cheer you, and do you good."
5222,_FLORA._,
5223,_FLORA._,_F._ (_aside_).                  Curse on my fate.
5224,_FLORA._,How can I escape? What devil hath now possessed her
5225,_FLORA._,To thwart me thus? And after all my service
5226,_FLORA._,To insist: so small a matter.
5227,_FLORA._,
5228,_FLORA._,_D._ (_giving_).            Here is the letter.      659
5229,_FLORA._,"Deliver it, please, with your own hand. Leave here"
5230,_FLORA._,At six o’clock to-night. Take Tristram with you.
5231,_FLORA._,"’Twill make me more at ease on your behalf,"
5232,_FLORA._,In case you are ill. (_gathering up papers._)
5233,_FLORA._,And whatsoe’er you do
5234,_FLORA._,Return by noon to-morrow: at which hour
5235,_FLORA._,I need the answer. You will oblige me much.
5236,_FLORA._,I wish you a pleasant journey.      [_Exit taking the papers._
5237,_FLORA._,
5238,_FLORA._,"_F._ Is that a blindfold player? Who is it to,"
5239,_FLORA._,This letter? The Duke of Milan! Ha! can it be!
5240,_FLORA._,"Is that the mischief? He is discovered, and I"
5241,_FLORA._,"Suspected of complicity, and thus      670"
5242,_FLORA._,She would expose us both?
5243,_FLORA._,
5244,_FLORA._,_Re-enter Tristram._
5245,_FLORA._,
5246,_FLORA._,We are both undone.
5247,_FLORA._,
5248,_FLORA._,_T._ (_half aside_). Another letter! came this like the last
5249,_FLORA._,Borne on the winds?
5250,_FLORA._,
5251,_FLORA._,"_F._ (_aside_).   She hath recognised the Duke,"
5252,_FLORA._,No doubt. ’Twas natural. But why suspect
5253,_FLORA._,"That I am in his secret? Till I am sure,"
5254,_FLORA._,I must still play my part.
5255,_FLORA._,
5256,_FLORA._,_T._ (_aside_).          Secrets again:
5257,_FLORA._,More mysteries.
5258,_FLORA._,
5259,_FLORA._,"_F._ (_to T._). Order me horses, Tristram,"
5260,_FLORA._,At six o’clock.
5261,_FLORA._,
5262,_FLORA._,_T._          What! is she off?
5263,_FLORA._,
5264,_FLORA._,_F._                          Who off?
5265,_FLORA._,
5266,_FLORA._,_T._ The lady you should meet to-night.
5267,_FLORA._,
5268,_FLORA._,_F._                                  Plague on you!
5269,_FLORA._,A coach at six: and be yourself prepared      680
5270,_FLORA._,To accompany me.
5271,_FLORA._,
5272,_FLORA._,_T._           Where go we?
5273,_FLORA._,
5274,_FLORA._,_Re-enter Ricardo._
5275,_FLORA._,
5276,_FLORA._,_F._                      To the devil.
5277,_FLORA._,Order the horses.
5278,_FLORA._,
5279,_FLORA._,_T._            Is our destination
5280,_FLORA._,A secret?
5281,_FLORA._,
5282,_FLORA._,_F._    No.
5283,_FLORA._,
5284,_FLORA._,_T._      Then who will ride postilion?
5285,_FLORA._,
5286,_FLORA._,"_F._ Go, fool, at once.      [_Exit T._"
5287,_FLORA._,"(_To R._)             Richard, you come in time:"
5288,_FLORA._,You are recognised. See here! The Countess bids me
5289,_FLORA._,Deliver you this letter.
5290,_FLORA._,
5291,_FLORA._,_R._ (_taking_).       To me! Diana!
5292,_FLORA._,Why! ’tis addressed to Milan. ’Tis impossible.
5293,_FLORA._,"Nay, nay; she knows not. What hath made you think it?"
5294,_FLORA._,
5295,_FLORA._,_F._ Because she bade me post this night to Milan
5296,_FLORA._,"To give this in your hands. I pleaded sickness,      690"
5297,_FLORA._,Begged she would find some other messenger:
5298,_FLORA._,Yet she refused. She would trust none but me.
5299,_FLORA._,
5300,_FLORA._,"_R._ And why, man, if you thought I was suspected,"
5301,_FLORA._,Did you refuse? Another messenger
5302,_FLORA._,Must have betrayed me.
5303,_FLORA._,
5304,_FLORA._,_F._                 True. I was a fool
5305,_FLORA._,"Not to have thought of that. No, now I think of it,"
5306,_FLORA._,I knew not whither I was to be sent
5307,_FLORA._,"When I excused myself. The fact is, Richard,"
5308,_FLORA._,"I thought I was discovered, and lost my head."
5309,_FLORA._,Laura and I had fixed to meet to-night.      700
5310,_FLORA._,"Our only hope is flight: misleading others,"
5311,_FLORA._,She has fallen into a trap: she is bound to marry
5312,_FLORA._,That fool St. Nicholas. I must persuade her
5313,_FLORA._,"To run away. Unless we meet, the moment"
5314,_FLORA._,Of all our life is past.
5315,_FLORA._,
5316,_FLORA._,_R._                   I see it: I see it.—
5317,_FLORA._,"And so she hath writ to me! Why should these words,"
5318,_FLORA._,Writ by her hand so set my heart adance?
5319,_FLORA._,"Is it beautiful? Nay,—but ’tis my name that leads"
5320,_FLORA._,"Every direction of these little curves,"
5321,_FLORA._,"Which, by long intercourse of hand and brain,      710"
5322,_FLORA._,Were specialised to typify and betray
5323,_FLORA._,The hiding spirit? There are such secrets here
5324,_FLORA._,As dazzle lovers’eyes. She will be mine.
5325,_FLORA._,"She wrote me a letter once before in scorn,"
5326,_FLORA._,With studied terms of coldness: yet to me
5327,_FLORA._,That seemed—I treasure it still—a lovers’meeting
5328,_FLORA._,"Of our two names on the same conscious page,"
5329,_FLORA._,"A daring intimacy, her own betrothal."
5330,_FLORA._,Was I deceived boasting so crazed a title?
5331,_FLORA._,What saith she now?
5332,_FLORA._,
5333,_FLORA._,_F._              Ha! do not break the seal.       720
5334,_FLORA._,
5335,_FLORA._,_R._ Is it not mine?
5336,_FLORA._,
5337,_FLORA._,_F._               She yet might ask it back:
5338,_FLORA._,And ’twould betray us if I had given it up.
5339,_FLORA._,
5340,_FLORA._,"_R._ Yes: you shall keep it till you start, and then"
5341,_FLORA._,Give it to me. You must discover of course
5342,_FLORA._,"That I am away from home, and leave the letter."
5343,_FLORA._,Will not that do?
5344,_FLORA._,
5345,_FLORA._,"_F._            This is my ruin, Richard:"
5346,_FLORA._,It means that I must be away to-night;
5347,_FLORA._,And that prevents my meeting Laura; and that
5348,_FLORA._,Leaves the field to my rival.
5349,_FLORA._,
5350,_FLORA._,_Re-enter St. Nicholas._
5351,_FLORA._,
5352,_FLORA._,"_R._                        Hush! see, he comes."
5353,_FLORA._,
5354,_FLORA._,"_N._ That paper you are in doubt of, gentlemen,"
5355,_FLORA._,"Is, I opine, the poem which I have lost:—      731"
5356,_FLORA._,You picked it up in the garden?—a private trifle
5357,_FLORA._,Which I’d recover gladly.
5358,_FLORA._,
5359,_FLORA._,"_R._                    I am sorry, sir,"
5360,_FLORA._,’Tis no such lofty matter. A letter it is
5361,_FLORA._,"Sealed and addressed, which takes our friend away."
5362,_FLORA._,"But I can say with truth, I’d rate myself"
5363,_FLORA._,"The happiest man in the world, could I believe"
5364,_FLORA._,That what I hold was fashioned ever so little
5365,_FLORA._,In your romantic vein.
5366,_FLORA._,
5367,_FLORA._,"_N._                 You make me proud, sir."
5368,_FLORA._,"Yet, you should know, I do not think my poems      740"
5369,_FLORA._,As good as others think them: they are but trifles.
5370,_FLORA._,I wish that I could stay to explain my meaning;
5371,_FLORA._,But I must seek my sonnet.      [_Exit._
5372,_FLORA._,
5373,_FLORA._,
5374,_FLORA._,_R._                     Your rival. O heavens!
5375,_FLORA._,
5376,_FLORA._,_F._ A fool that fortune favours.
5377,_FLORA._,
5378,_FLORA._,_R._                            Not at all.
5379,_FLORA._,Diana hath here some purpose we have not guessed.
5380,_FLORA._,Come to my room: there we will read her letter;
5381,_FLORA._,"And if it shew no sign of my discovery,"
5382,_FLORA._,I’ll write it such an answer as it asks;
5383,_FLORA._,"Which, when you have, you may perform your service,"
5384,_FLORA._,And see your mistress both. ’Tis but to start      750
5385,_FLORA._,"At the set time, and turn about in the dark."
5386,_FLORA._,
5387,_FLORA._,_F._ Make a pretended journey?
5388,_FLORA._,
5389,_FLORA._,_R._                         An expedition
5390,_FLORA._,Some ten miles out and back.
5391,_FLORA._,
5392,_FLORA._,"_F._                       I’ll do it, Richard."
5393,_FLORA._,"O, you were ever excellent."
5394,_FLORA._,
5395,_FLORA._,_R._                      Arrange
5396,_FLORA._,Some practicable stages; and remember
5397,_FLORA._,To keep an eye on the time.
5398,_FLORA._,
5399,_FLORA._,_F._                      Trust me.
5400,_FLORA._,
5401,_FLORA._,"_R._                              And, hark!"
5402,_FLORA._,"If some night you should make the real journey,"
5403,_FLORA._,Would Laura fly with you?
5404,_FLORA._,
5405,_FLORA._,_F._                    Fly where?
5406,_FLORA._,
5407,_FLORA._,_R._                             I’ll tell you.
5408,_FLORA._,I have planned the whole thing for you: I put my palace      759
5409,_FLORA._,At your command; my servants shall receive you;
5410,_FLORA._,"The archbishop marry you, and all my friends"
5411,_FLORA._,Attend your fête.
5412,_FLORA._,
5413,_FLORA._,"_F._            You cannot mean it, Richard!"
5414,_FLORA._,
5415,_FLORA._,"_R._ By heaven, I do: but you must first persuade"
5416,_FLORA._,Your lady to make sail.
5417,_FLORA._,
5418,_FLORA._,"_F._                  That would be easy,"
5419,_FLORA._,With such a port to run for. But how soon?
5420,_FLORA._,It could not be to-night.
5421,_FLORA._,
5422,_FLORA._,_R._                    I need one day
5423,_FLORA._,"To warn my people. Come now to my room,"
5424,_FLORA._,Where we will read this letter. Our success
5425,_FLORA._,Depends on secrecy.
5426,_FLORA._,
5427,_FLORA._,_F._              True.
5428,_FLORA._,
5429,_FLORA._,_R._                  Go within:
5430,_FLORA._,To avoid encounter I will follow alone.      770
5431,_FLORA._,
5432,_FLORA._,_F._ To your room?
5433,_FLORA._,
5434,_FLORA._,_R._             Yes.
5435,_FLORA._,
5436,_FLORA._,_F._                Which suite are you in?
5437,_FLORA._,
5438,_FLORA._,_R._                                          They call it
5439,_FLORA._,One of the Grecian muses.
5440,_FLORA._,
5441,_FLORA._,"_F._                    Yes, but which?"
5442,_FLORA._,
5443,_FLORA._,"_R._ I quite forget. At the end of the corridor,"
5444,_FLORA._,Beyond the tower.
5445,_FLORA._,
5446,_FLORA._,_F._            I know. You’ll find me there.      [_Exit._
5447,_FLORA._,
5448,_FLORA._,"_R._ To get this Frederick married, more concerns me"
5449,_FLORA._,Than anything else. ’Tis plain Diana loves him:
5450,_FLORA._,"And till he’s gone, ’tis folly to besiege"
5451,_FLORA._,"Her garrisoned heart. I must engage my skill,"

5453,_FLORA._,That I can do. ’Tis a most blessed chance      780
5454,_FLORA._,"That he is so well disposed, and hath a lady"

5458,_FLORA._,_Re-enter Tristram with a paper._
5459,_FLORA._,
5460,_FLORA._,_T._ I have found a prize: just exactly what I wanted:
5461,_FLORA._,"one of my master’s love-letters, or a piece of one,—"
5462,_FLORA._,"that’s the third to-day,—lying on the walk. It was not"
5463,_FLORA._,"there when I went to order the horses, else I must have"
5464,_FLORA._,"trod on it; but when I came back, it lay in the middle"
5465,_FLORA._,"of the path, as if dropped from the skies. Reveal what"
5466,_FLORA._,"it may, it goes to the Countess to-morrow; and it"
5467,_FLORA._,"should stand me in something handsome. Unsealed,"
5468,_FLORA._,"unfolded even, for any to read: and no name. Poetry"
5469,_FLORA._,"like my master’s. There’s no harm in my reading,"
5470,_FLORA._,even though I should not understand.
5471,_FLORA._,
5472,_FLORA._,(_Reads._)—‘_Master of mine!_’—Ha! ’tis the lady.
5473,_FLORA._,
5474,_FLORA._,"‘_Master of mine, remember for pity,"
5475,_FLORA._,"What sobs of fluting lips, wan with dismay_,’"
5476,_FLORA._,
5477,_FLORA._,Poor thing!
5478,_FLORA._,
5479,_FLORA._,"‘_And malison of death, my soulless clay,"
5480,_FLORA._,Panteth in thine unspeak’ble purgat’ry_.’     800
5481,_FLORA._,
5482,_FLORA._,_Unspeak’ble!_—that is unspeakable; and _purgatree!_
5483,_FLORA._,—why the big O hath fallen out. I never loved this
5484,_FLORA._,"purgatory, and quarrel not at any shortening of it.—"
5485,_FLORA._,‘_Enchained long whilom._’—Mysteries and crimes!
5486,_FLORA._,chained is she? Where can he have chained her? and
5487,_FLORA._,"how, if she be chained, can she have cast this on the"
5488,_FLORA._,path? unless she threw it from the window....
5489,_FLORA._,
5490,_FLORA._,"‘_Enchained long whilom, was I fain to flee._’"
5491,_FLORA._,
5492,_FLORA._,Just so! But is she fled or no? I wish she wrote
5493,_FLORA._,clearer sense.

5503,_FLORA._,
5504,_FLORA._,"_N._ (_coming forward_). Tristram, where found you"
5505,_FLORA._,that? it was not intended for your reading.
5506,_FLORA._,
5507,_FLORA._,"_T._ So I guess, sir; but if letters be purposely thrown"
5508,_FLORA._,"open on the ground, they may be read by those for"
5509,_FLORA._,whom they were not intended.
5510,_FLORA._,
5511,_FLORA._,_N._ Give it to me. ’Tis mine.
5512,_FLORA._,
5513,_FLORA._,"_T._ I see no sign of that, sir, unless you will say"
5514,_FLORA._,that everything which the ladies let fall belongs to you.
5515,_FLORA._,
5516,_FLORA._,"_N._ No impertinence, man: give it me at once."
5517,_FLORA._,
5518,_FLORA._,_T._ Nay; I have my duty. This belongs to my
5519,_FLORA._,master. I shall guard it for him.
5520,_FLORA._,
5521,_FLORA._,_N._ I tell you ’tis mine.
5522,_FLORA._,
5523,_FLORA._,_T._ So you said of Lady Laura’s glove.
5524,_FLORA._,
5525,_FLORA._,_N._ That has nothing to do with it. Give me the
5526,_FLORA._,paper.
5527,_FLORA._,
5528,_FLORA._,"_T._ Not till ’tis proved to be yours, sir: which can"
5529,_FLORA._,never be.
5530,_FLORA._,
5531,_FLORA._,"_N._ I tell you, Tristram, that I wrote it myself."
5532,_FLORA._,
5533,_FLORA._,"_T._ We shall soon see that, sir. This is writ"
5534,_FLORA._,by a lady; who is prisoned or chained somewhere in the
5535,_FLORA._,"court. And she says;—well, what she says I cannot"
5536,_FLORA._,"tell; but my master thinks she has run away, and has"
5537,_FLORA._,bade me order the horses to be after her.
5538,_FLORA._,
5539,_FLORA._,"_N._ What ridiculous stuff you make of it, Tristram."
5540,_FLORA._,’Tis addressed to Love: you do not understand.
5541,_FLORA._,
5542,_FLORA._,"_T._ Yes: it is love, and court love too: I understand"
5543,_FLORA._,"that well enough, and I understand that ’tis writ to a"
5544,_FLORA._,man; therefore ’tis pikestaff-plain that ’tis writ by a
5545,_FLORA._,woman: therefore it half follows that you did not write
5546,_FLORA._,it: and therefore it belongs to my master.
5547,_FLORA._,
5548,_FLORA._,_N._ How therefore belongs it to your master?
5549,_FLORA._,
5550,_FLORA._,"_T._ Why, whose else should it be? His letters come"
5551,_FLORA._,"from the four quarters, no one knows whither; just"
5552,_FLORA._,where this came from.
5553,_FLORA._,
5554,_FLORA._,"_N._ Nonsense, Tristram: I assure you ’tis mine."
5555,_FLORA._,
5556,_FLORA._,_T._ Think not to owl me thus.
5557,_FLORA._,
5558,_FLORA._,_N._ Man! I swear that I composed that poem myself.
5559,_FLORA._,Had you any culture you would distinguish it from the
5560,_FLORA._,poor style of a woman. It has fallen from my pocket
5561,_FLORA._,"by accident: and if you will not give it me, I must"
5562,_FLORA._,take it from you.
5563,_FLORA._,
5564,_FLORA._,"_T._ Hands off, sir, now. I can’t think why you should"
5565,_FLORA._,try to get what belongs to another. You are mistaken.
5566,_FLORA._,'Master of mine’it says—and would a man write
5567,_FLORA._,thus? (_begins to read_).
5568,_FLORA._,
5569,_FLORA._,_N._ Death! stop mine ears! That I should hear my verse
5570,_FLORA._,"Again profaned by thee, thou baseborn clown."
5571,_FLORA._,
5572,_FLORA._,"_T._ I read correctly, sir. If you find fault with my"
5573,_FLORA._,"reading, ’tis the strangeness of the matter. I have"
5574,_FLORA._,good reasons for not parting with this; and I am not
5575,_FLORA._,a baseborn clown.
5576,_FLORA._,
5577,_FLORA._,_N._ Worse; thou art a thief.
5578,_FLORA._,
5579,_FLORA._,_T._ Thief call you me? Now were the verses ten
5580,_FLORA._,"thousand times yours, sir, I’d never give 'em you."
5581,_FLORA._,I defy you!

5583,_FLORA._,"_N._ Thou to defy me, slave; paid by the month"

5628,_FREDERICK._,"_T._ Pray, sir...."
5629,_FREDERICK._,
5630,_FREDERICK._,_F._ Not a word. Obey me.      900
5631,_FREDERICK._,
5632,_FREDERICK._,_T._ Heaven help us! what is this for?
5633,_FREDERICK._,
5634,_FREDERICK._,_F._ Silence. Are they off?
5635,_FREDERICK._,
5636,_FREDERICK._,_T._ They are coming.
5637,_FREDERICK._,
5638,_FREDERICK._,_F._ Hark now what you have to do. Cross the grass
5639,_FREDERICK._,"silently, unlock my door, creep upstairs like a thief,"
5640,_FREDERICK._,and sit in my chamber without a movement till I
5641,_FREDERICK._,come.
5642,_FREDERICK._,
5643,_FREDERICK._,_T._ The grass is like a sponge. I have begun to
5644,_FREDERICK._,catch cold already: I am just going to sneeze.

5646,_FREDERICK._,"_F._ Sneeze, and I’ll strangle you.      910"
5647,_FREDERICK._,
5648,_FREDERICK._,_T._ Is this your treatment for all my services?
5649,_FREDERICK._,
5650,_FREDERICK._,_F._ Your service is your duty to obey:
5651,_FREDERICK._,And once you served me well: of late you are grown
5652,_FREDERICK._,"Questionous and prying; which I have so far borne,"
5653,_FREDERICK._,Because I have been in doubt whether it were best
5654,_FREDERICK._,To thrash you or discharge you.
5655,_FREDERICK._,
5656,_FREDERICK._,_T._ And no wonder neither. Thus the world will
5657,_FREDERICK._,repay devotion. Can I see you so blind to your good
5658,_FREDERICK._,"fortune, and when heaven’s door stands open...."
5659,_FREDERICK._,
5660,_FREDERICK._,_F._ Heaven’s door! what is this?      920
5661,_FREDERICK._,
5662,_FREDERICK._,_T._ You do not know.
5663,_FREDERICK._,
5664,_FREDERICK._,_F._ Say what you mean.
5665,_FREDERICK._,
5666,_FREDERICK._,"_T._ This court, wherein you serve and get no thanks,"
5667,_FREDERICK._,You might rule and be thanked.
5668,_FREDERICK._,
5669,_FREDERICK._,_F._                         Just as I thought;
5670,_FREDERICK._,Ere I dismiss you I shall tell the Countess
5671,_FREDERICK._,Your insolence. The whipping you will get
5672,_FREDERICK._,Will save me trouble.
5673,_FREDERICK._,
5674,_FREDERICK._,_T._                I pray you on my knees.

5680,_FREDERICK._,
5681,_FREDERICK._,"_F._ Silence: go do as I bid you. Begone, and take"
5682,_FREDERICK._,your boots.      [_Exit T._
5683,_FREDERICK._,So my man knows her secret. ’Tis high time
5684,_FREDERICK._,That Laura and I were off. This salves my conscience
5685,_FREDERICK._,From any scruple. ’Tis a rule of art
5686,_FREDERICK._,"To make obstructions serve: and my chief hindrance,"
5687,_FREDERICK._,"Diana’s passion, can but urge me on."
5688,_FREDERICK._,"So the mischance, which drew me hence to-night,"
5689,_FREDERICK._,Hath brought me hither a more secret way.
5690,_FREDERICK._,The night is still. I would there were a wind.
5691,_FREDERICK._,And there’s the clock. (_Clock strikes._) I’ll wait
5692,_FREDERICK._,Till it hath sounded.... No light.... I’ll tap.      941

5699,_LAURA._,
5700,_LAURA._,"Frederick, not gone to Milan?"
5701,_LAURA._,
5702,_LAURA._,_F._ I escaped but with a thousand torments—
5703,_LAURA._,May I come in?
5704,_LAURA._,
5705,_LAURA._,_L._         We can talk here.
5706,_LAURA._,
5707,_LAURA._,_F._                           The night
5708,_LAURA._,"Is very still, our voices will be heard:"
5709,_LAURA._,They run along the wall.
5710,_LAURA._,
5711,_LAURA._,_L._                   Then I’ll come out.
5712,_LAURA._,
5713,_LAURA._,_F._ We shall be seen.
5714,_LAURA._,
5715,_LAURA._,_L._                 The maids are all abed.
5716,_LAURA._,There’s none to see us; and the moon is clouded.
5717,_LAURA._,We’ll walk by the yew hedge. Give me your hand.
5718,_LAURA._,
5719,_LAURA._,_F._ ’Tis but one step.
5720,_LAURA._,
5721,_LAURA._,_L._                  I know. (_Comes down._)
5722,_LAURA._,
5723,_LAURA._,_F._                        My kiss. (_Kisses her._)
5724,_LAURA._,
5725,_LAURA._,"_L._                               O Frederick,      950"
5726,_LAURA._,"You have broken your own rule, and kissed me thrice."
5727,_LAURA._,
5728,_LAURA._,"_F._ One kiss a day, with two days in arrear,"
5729,_LAURA._,Makes three.
5730,_LAURA._,
5731,_LAURA._,"_L._ Alas! I thought ’twas love’s excess,"
5732,_LAURA._,And still I am kissed by rule.
5733,_LAURA._,
5734,_LAURA._,"_F._                         And be content, love,"
5735,_LAURA._,"To keep the little rules we make ourselves,"
5736,_LAURA._,Since thou must break such great ones; and canst dare
5737,_LAURA._,"Deceive the Countess, disobey thy father,"
5738,_LAURA._,And brave the world’s opinion: all which sins
5739,_LAURA._,I come to stablish in thee. There’s now no choice
5740,_LAURA._,But fly with me or take St. Nicholas.      960
5741,_LAURA._,
5742,_LAURA._,_L._ That name is desperation. Have you no plan
5743,_LAURA._,To save me?
5744,_LAURA._,
5745,_LAURA._,_F._      If you dare fly with me to Milan.
5746,_LAURA._,
5747,_LAURA._,_L._ To-night?
5748,_LAURA._,
5749,_LAURA._,_F._         Would ’twere to-night.
5750,_LAURA._,
5751,_LAURA._,"_L._                              But when, love, when?"
5752,_LAURA._,
5753,_LAURA._,_F._ Trust me to find the time.
5754,_LAURA._,
5755,_LAURA._,_L._                          And why to Milan?
5756,_LAURA._,
5757,_LAURA._,"_F._ My friend the Duke, being now away from home,"
5758,_LAURA._,"Lends me his palace. All we else should lack,"
5759,_LAURA._,"Appointment and conveyance, he supplies."
5760,_LAURA._,"We have his countenance now, his influence after,"
5761,_LAURA._,To appease your father and sister.
5762,_LAURA._,
5763,_LAURA._,_L._                             Are you such friends?
5764,_LAURA._,
5765,_LAURA._,_F._ There cannot be two hearts in all the world
5766,_LAURA._,Nearer-familiar than are his and mine.      971
5767,_LAURA._,
5768,_LAURA._,_L._ You never told me.
5769,_LAURA._,
5770,_LAURA._,_F._                  I had not heard from him
5771,_LAURA._,Now for three years.
5772,_LAURA._,
5773,_LAURA._,_L._               ’Tis strange.
5774,_LAURA._,
5775,_LAURA._,"_F._                           Nay, ’tis not strange."
5776,_LAURA._,Ours was a boyhood friendship; such affection
5777,_LAURA._,Born in life’s spring is perfect with the flower.
5778,_LAURA._,"The memory is a binding intimacy,"
5779,_LAURA._,Which grows as we grow from it: in its strength
5780,_LAURA._,Is our lost tenderness; its truth is proved
5781,_LAURA._,By every lie the world has given our hopes:
5782,_LAURA._,Absence and age best feed it. We remember      980
5783,_LAURA._,"First ecstasies, and the unreserved embrace"
5784,_LAURA._,"Of mutual spirits, and worship the remembrance."
5785,_LAURA._,"The Duke and I are strangers in the world,"
5786,_LAURA._,"Courteous acquaintance in society,"
5787,_LAURA._,"But to ourselves, twin individual gods."
5788,_LAURA._,
5789,_LAURA._,"_L._ Alas, poor me!"
5790,_LAURA._,
5791,_LAURA._,"_F._              Can it displease you, love,"
5792,_LAURA._,I have such a friend?
5793,_LAURA._,
5794,_LAURA._,"_L._                Ere it is too late, Frederick,"
5795,_LAURA._,Think if you love me enough.
5796,_LAURA._,
5797,_LAURA._,"_F._                       Why, ’tis a question"
5798,_LAURA._,To make me think you think I think I do not.
5799,_LAURA._,
5800,_LAURA._,"_L._ Indeed, ere I consent to be your wife....      990"
5801,_LAURA._,
5802,_LAURA._,"_F._ You have consented, Laura."
5803,_LAURA._,
5804,_LAURA._,"_L._                          Nay, but hear me."
5805,_LAURA._,"Before we marry, you must know a thing,"
5806,_LAURA._,"Which, since it might lessen your love for me,"
5807,_LAURA._,Shall not be kept till after.
5808,_LAURA._,
5809,_LAURA._,_F._                        Then tell it quickly.
5810,_LAURA._,
5811,_LAURA._,"_L._ What you have said, and what I have to tell,"
5812,_LAURA._,So dwarfs my little humble plant of love.
5813,_LAURA._,
5814,_LAURA._,_F._ Tell it.
5815,_LAURA._,
5816,_LAURA._,_L._        Diana loves you.
5817,_LAURA._,
5818,_LAURA._,_F._                       You know it too!
5819,_LAURA._,
5820,_LAURA._,_L._ You know it!
5821,_LAURA._,
5822,_LAURA._,"_F._            I!—Why, Laura, is this your secret?"
5823,_LAURA._,
5824,_LAURA._,"_L._ I see you have guessed it; yet, perhaps, for thinking"
5825,_LAURA._,"Thou shouldst be loyal where thy faith is cherished,"
5826,_LAURA._,Thou hast never weighed her claim with mine; and that      1001
5827,_LAURA._,I’d have thee do. Look to thine interest:
5828,_LAURA._,For loving women differ not so much
5829,_LAURA._,But all may make good wives; and whatsoe’er
5830,_LAURA._,"Thou thinkest to see in me, Frederick, I am sure"
5831,_LAURA._,I lack all excellence. There’s nothing in me
5832,_LAURA._,"Why I should have preferment o’er another,"
5833,_LAURA._,And least of all of her who can boast loveliness
5834,_LAURA._,"To match her love; and add those other gifts,"
5835,_LAURA._,Which are necessities to one like thee.      1010
5836,_LAURA._,"Thou, with high friendships shouldst have power and station,"
5837,_LAURA._,"And fitted for the fairest use of wealth,"
5838,_LAURA._,"Thou art wronged in the want of it: and, Love, I love thee"
5839,_LAURA._,"So better than myself, that I would see thee"
5840,_LAURA._,Happily another’s rather than my own
5841,_LAURA._,"With the reproach of selfishness, the knowledge"
5842,_LAURA._,That thou wert sacrificed for my poor love.
5843,_LAURA._,
5844,_LAURA._,"_F._ If women differ little, what of men?"
5845,_LAURA._,"St. Nicholas loves you, and would give you rank."
5846,_LAURA._,
5847,_LAURA._,"_L._ Thou knowst thou wrongst me, Frederick, turning thus      1020"
5848,_LAURA._,My love of thee to banter of my love.
5849,_LAURA._,
5850,_LAURA._,_F._ I only banter where you dare be grave.
5851,_LAURA._,
5852,_LAURA._,"_L._ Because thou knowest, Love, I desire not wealth."
5853,_LAURA._,My happiness would be to live with thee
5854,_LAURA._,And for thee: but to thee what can I bring?
5855,_LAURA._,"Think not because I wish thee fortunate,"
5856,_LAURA._,"That I forget my hope, or slight the treasure"
5857,_LAURA._,So much desirèd of my loving soul.
5858,_LAURA._,
5859,_LAURA._,_F._ And for that loving soul you bid me take
5860,_LAURA._,"Some fifty thousand ducats by the year,      1030"
5861,_LAURA._,"A major-domo, and a heap of things"
5862,_LAURA._,That are a proverb for their emptiness!
5863,_LAURA._,
5864,_LAURA._,"_L._ Diana’s love, I said; that with the ducats."
5865,_LAURA._,
5866,_LAURA._,"_F._ Well, what doth all this come to when ’tis told?"
5867,_LAURA._,First is Diana’s love. Diana’s love
5868,_LAURA._,"Is nothing, for I do not love Diana."
5869,_LAURA._,Next are the ducats: fifty thousand ducats.
5870,_LAURA._,"They are nothing either—by the year! Why, Laura,"
5871,_LAURA._,Were’t fifty thousand ducats by the day
5872,_LAURA._,’Twere nothing to me. You can little guess      1040
5873,_LAURA._,My prodigal soul. I should expend it all
5874,_LAURA._,And sit at home and be as poor as ever.
5875,_LAURA._,
5876,_LAURA._,_L._ How could you spend so much?
5877,_LAURA._,
5878,_LAURA._,_F._                            Nothing is much.
5879,_LAURA._,Man’s capabilities being infinite
5880,_LAURA._,"And his state pitiful, the simplest scheme"
5881,_LAURA._,"For bettering any faculty he hath,"
5882,_LAURA._,Would eat up all the money in the world.
5883,_LAURA._,
5884,_LAURA._,_L._ But to use riches rightly—
5885,_LAURA._,
5886,_LAURA._,_F._                           I have no desire
5887,_LAURA._,"That earth can satisfy, but one; and that"
5888,_LAURA._,Shall I play false to?
5889,_LAURA._,
5890,_LAURA._,_L._                 Nay; I trust you well.      1050
5891,_LAURA._,
5892,_LAURA._,"_F._ Then waste no more the precious moments, Laura,"
5893,_LAURA._,To question the great blessing we enjoy.
5894,_LAURA._,Our hours will all be as this hour to-night;
5895,_LAURA._,Either to step with in eternity
5896,_LAURA._,"Towards our perfection with unwavering will,"
5897,_LAURA._,"Or with a questioning purpose let it slide,"
5898,_LAURA._,And leave us far behind. A man’s desires
5899,_LAURA._,Are his companions and by them he is known;
5900,_LAURA._,But he himself is what he grows to be
5901,_LAURA._,Using his time.
5902,_LAURA._,
5903,_LAURA._,_L._          How best to use it now?      1060
5904,_LAURA._,
5905,_LAURA._,"_F._  First to assure thee, dearest, that all the joys"
5906,_LAURA._,I have had or hoped are nothing to thy love.
5907,_LAURA._,"And next, that we may make it sure, I ask thee"
5908,_LAURA._,To say thou’lt fly with me.
5909,_LAURA._,
5910,_LAURA._,"_L._                      When, Frederick, when?"
5911,_LAURA._,I fear ’twill never be; we have but two days.
5912,_LAURA._,
5913,_LAURA._,"_F._ Therefore be ready at any moment, Laura."
5914,_LAURA._,All’s fixed except the time: that must depend
5915,_LAURA._,"Upon occasion. If I cannot see thee,"
5916,_LAURA._,"Ricardo, whom I have made my confidant,"
5917,_LAURA._,"Will bring thee word. He cannot be suspected,      1070"
5918,_LAURA._,And thou mayst trust him.
5919,_LAURA._,
5920,_LAURA._,_L._                    Dare I tell my father?
5921,_LAURA._,
5922,_LAURA._,_F._ That’s my chief scruple; and yet we dare not tell him.
5923,_LAURA._,If only Providence would give him back
5924,_LAURA._,His hearing for one day! After one day
5925,_LAURA._,"Spent with St. Nicholas, I should not fear"
5926,_LAURA._,To broach our matter.
5927,_LAURA._,
5928,_LAURA._,_L._                He has the marriage contract
5929,_LAURA._,Ready to sign.
5930,_LAURA._,
5931,_LAURA._,_F._         Not as he thinks. By luck
5932,_LAURA._,They entrusted it to me; and as I have drawn it
5933,_LAURA._,"He cannot sign it. He must give it me back,"
5934,_LAURA._,And that will make delay.
5935,_LAURA._,
5936,_LAURA._,"_L._                    Of all these chances,      1080"
5937,_LAURA._,If any one go wrong....
5938,_LAURA._,
5939,_LAURA._,_F._                  All will go well.
5940,_LAURA._,"See, here’s my portrait, Laura, which I promised:"
5941,_LAURA._,’Tis framed like yours; that is its only merit.
5942,_LAURA._,
5943,_LAURA._,"_L._ O, let me have it."
5944,_LAURA._,
5945,_LAURA._,_F._                  Take it. That you should care
5946,_LAURA._,"To look upon it, makes me ashamed."
5947,_LAURA._,
5948,_LAURA._,"_L._                             O, Frederick!"
5949,_LAURA._,"If you knew all my foolishness, I think"
5950,_LAURA._,You would despise me. By this little light
5951,_LAURA._,I can see nothing. Is’t well done?
5952,_LAURA._,
5953,_LAURA._,"_F._                             So, so."
5954,_LAURA._,It flatters me: but that’s the artist’s trick.
5955,_LAURA._,
5956,_LAURA._,_L._ Flatters you!                               1090
5957,_LAURA._,
5958,_LAURA._,"_F._             Well, it taints me with the fashion,"
5959,_LAURA._,"Which is the vulgar dress of imitations,"
5960,_LAURA._,And a less blunder than mere naked skill.
5961,_LAURA._,The individual ideals are given
5962,_LAURA._,To genius only.
5963,_LAURA._,
5964,_LAURA._,_L._          I would have had you painted
5965,_LAURA._,Just as you are.
5966,_LAURA._,
5967,_LAURA._,_F._           Nay.—Hark! I hear a step....
5968,_LAURA._,
5969,_LAURA._,_L._ What can we do?
5970,_LAURA._,
5971,_LAURA._,_F._               Some one is coming hither.
5972,_LAURA._,
5973,_LAURA._,_L._ Where can we hide?
5974,_LAURA._,
5975,_LAURA._,_F._                  I cannot think; unless
5976,_LAURA._,You creep along the hedge. I’ll wait and see
5977,_LAURA._,Who ’tis. I think it must be Tristram.      [_Exit Laura._
5978,_LAURA._,
5979,_LAURA._,_Enter Ricardo._
5980,_LAURA._,
5981,_RICARDO._,_RICARDO._
5982,_RICARDO._,
5983,_RICARDO._,Frederick!
5984,_RICARDO._,
5985,_RICARDO._,_F._ Richard! what is the matter?      1100
5986,_RICARDO._,
5987,_RICARDO._,_R._                            Forgive my coming:
5988,_RICARDO._,"But if you wish it thought that you are at Milan,"
5989,_RICARDO._,"Your room should not be lighted, and your servant"
5990,_RICARDO._,Should not be singing.
5991,_RICARDO._,
5992,_RICARDO._,_F._                 Singing!—is Tristram singing?
5993,_RICARDO._,
5994,_RICARDO._,_R._ Hark! You may hear.      [_T.'s lute heard faintly._
5995,_RICARDO._,
5996,_RICARDO._,_F._                   By heaven!—the wretch! Tell Laura
5997,_RICARDO._,Why I am gone. All will be lost.      [_Exit._
5998,_RICARDO._,
5999,_RICARDO._,"_R._                           Indeed,"
6000,_RICARDO._,"Unless Diana is sleeping very soundly,"
6001,_RICARDO._,The escapade’s betrayed.
6002,_RICARDO._,
6003,_RICARDO._,_Re-enter Laura._
6004,_RICARDO._,
6005,_RICARDO._,"My service, lady."
6006,_RICARDO._,
6007,_RICARDO._,"_L._ I heard you speak with Frederick, sir, and thank you"
6008,_RICARDO._,For your kind offices.
6009,_RICARDO._,
6010,_RICARDO._,_R._                 I need no thanks.
6011,_RICARDO._,I have a deeper interest in your welfare      1110
6012,_RICARDO._,Than you can guess. I fear that fellow Tristram
6013,_RICARDO._,May ruin us all.
6014,_RICARDO._,
6015,_RICARDO._,"_L._           Frederick hath told me, sir,"
6016,_RICARDO._,"You know our secret, and will act between us;"
6017,_RICARDO._,For which I thank you. I bid you now good-night:
6018,_RICARDO._,I should go in.
6019,_RICARDO._,
6020,_RICARDO._,_R._          As soon as possible.
6021,_RICARDO._,Pray you be not observed. But first I beg you
6022,_RICARDO._,Thank me for Frederick’s visit.
6023,_RICARDO._,
6024,_RICARDO._,"_L._                          You, sir! why?"
6025,_RICARDO._,
6026,_RICARDO._,"_R._ Why, but for me he had been at Milan."
6027,_RICARDO._,
6028,_RICARDO._,_L._                                     Ah!
6029,_RICARDO._,I thank you very much.
6030,_RICARDO._,
6031,_RICARDO._,_R._                 He doth not scheme
6032,_RICARDO._,Well for himself. He needs a wife.
6033,_RICARDO._,
6034,_RICARDO._,_L._                             Indeed      1120
6035,_RICARDO._,I cannot scheme.
6036,_RICARDO._,
6037,_RICARDO._,_R._           And ’tis the fairer wish
6038,_RICARDO._,You neither may have ever need. Good-night.
6039,_RICARDO._,
6040,_RICARDO._,"_L._ Good-night, sir.      [_Exit in at window._"
6041,_RICARDO._,
6042,_RICARDO._,"_R._                She’s a good creature, quick and sensible;"
6043,_RICARDO._,She’ll fly with Frederick. It provokes my soul
6044,_RICARDO._,That that conceited inconsiderate loon
6045,_RICARDO._,Should put us all in peril. I have half a mind
6046,_RICARDO._,To take him in my pay.
6047,_RICARDO._,
6048,_RICARDO._,_Re-enter Frederick with a lute._
6049,_RICARDO._,
6050,_RICARDO._,_F._                 Is Laura gone?
6051,_RICARDO._,
6052,_RICARDO._,_R._ And not too soon. If your fine musical man
6053,_RICARDO._,Have waked the Countess she may have heard you too.
6054,_RICARDO._,"He is silenced now, I hope."
6055,_RICARDO._,
6056,_RICARDO._,_F._                      Here’s his curst lute:      1130
6057,_RICARDO._,I took it from him.
6058,_RICARDO._,
6059,_RICARDO._,_R._              Ha! then give it to me.
6060,_RICARDO._,"The very thing. I’ll step into the gap,"
6061,_RICARDO._,And take the blame of this untimely singing
6062,_RICARDO._,Upon myself. Go in and leave me here:
6063,_RICARDO._,And if to-morrow any ask who ’twas
6064,_RICARDO._,That played and sang at midnight—why ’twas I.
6065,_RICARDO._,Go in.
6066,_RICARDO._,
6067,_RICARDO._,"_F._  Well, bravo, Richard: you’re a genius."
6068,_RICARDO._,
6069,_RICARDO._,_R._                                       Leave me.
6070,_RICARDO._,
6071,_RICARDO._,_F._ I go. Good-night.      [_Exit._
6072,_RICARDO._,
6073,_RICARDO._,_R._                 Now must I sing.
6074,_RICARDO._,And when there’s none to hear I am sometimes able
6075,_RICARDO._,To please myself: else I must ask indulgence.      1140
6076,_RICARDO._,
6077,_RICARDO._,_Sings._
6078,_RICARDO._,
6079,_RICARDO._,"My eyes for beauty pine,"
6080,_RICARDO._,My soul for Goddës grace:
6081,_RICARDO._,No other hope nor care is mine;
6082,_RICARDO._,To heaven I turn my face.
6083,_RICARDO._,
6084,_RICARDO._,One splendour thence is shed
6085,_RICARDO._,From all the stars above:
6086,_RICARDO._,"’Tis namèd when God’s name is said,"
6087,_RICARDO._,"’Tis love, ’tis heavenly love."
6088,_RICARDO._,
6089,_RICARDO._,"And every gentle heart,"
6090,_RICARDO._,"That burns with true desire,      1150"
6091,_RICARDO._,Is lit from eyes that mirror part
6092,_RICARDO._,Of that celestial fire.
6093,_RICARDO._,
6094,_RICARDO._,_NICHOLAS_ (_heard entering unseen_).
6095,_RICARDO._,
6096,_RICARDO._,Very sweet!
6097,_RICARDO._,
6098,_RICARDO._,_R._ (_aside_). Ha! have I an audience after all?
6099,_RICARDO._,
6100,_RICARDO._,"_N._ Ricardo, I believe."
6101,_RICARDO._,
6102,_RICARDO._,"_R._                   St Nicholas, is’t not?"
6103,_RICARDO._,
6104,_RICARDO._,"_N._ Your lute, sir, as Amphion drew the trees"
6105,_RICARDO._,"Up by the roots, hath drawn me from my bed."
6106,_RICARDO._,
6107,_RICARDO._,_R._ Would I could make the lyrical apology
6108,_RICARDO._,"With which, I doubt not, he replanted them."
6109,_RICARDO._,
6110,_RICARDO._,"_N._ Nay, no apology. And, to say truth,"
6111,_RICARDO._,’Twas not so much your music as my wish      1160
6112,_RICARDO._,To catch the singer brought me out. I thought
6113,_RICARDO._,’Twas Frederick’s servant. He should not forget it
6114,_RICARDO._,If I should catch him breaking rules.
6115,_RICARDO._,
6116,_RICARDO._,_R._                                I hope
6117,_RICARDO._,I break no rules.
6118,_RICARDO._,
6119,_RICARDO._,_N._            You see you are very near
6120,_RICARDO._,The ladies’windows.
6121,_RICARDO._,
6122,_RICARDO._,_R._               True: of course I must be.
6123,_RICARDO._,
6124,_RICARDO._,_N._ And serenading is among the offences
6125,_RICARDO._,Punished with diet.
6126,_RICARDO._,
6127,_RICARDO._,"_R._              Being a stranger, sir,"
6128,_RICARDO._,I cannot be suspected of the knowledge
6129,_RICARDO._,"That might incriminate me. You, no doubt,"
6130,_RICARDO._,Are more familiar.
6131,_RICARDO._,
6132,_RICARDO._,"_N._             Yes, there is one window      1170"
6133,_RICARDO._,Which I should know: and as you chance to stand
6134,_RICARDO._,"Just underneath it, I will not dissemble"
6135,_RICARDO._,That when I saw you first I felt the pangs
6136,_RICARDO._,Of maddening jealousy. To find ’twas you
6137,_RICARDO._,Relieved me entirely.
6138,_RICARDO._,
6139,_RICARDO._,"_R._                Nay then, truly, sir,"
6140,_RICARDO._,I owe you apology: for if your mistress
6141,_RICARDO._,"Should have mistook my falala for yours,"
6142,_RICARDO._,The poor performance may have hurt your credit.
6143,_RICARDO._,
6144,_RICARDO._,"_N._ Nay, sir, I sing so seldom, I only fear"
6145,_RICARDO._,I cannot be suspected. If I might      1180
6146,_RICARDO._,I’d ask you sing again. There’s nought affects me
6147,_RICARDO._,Like music in the moonlight.
6148,_RICARDO._,
6149,_RICARDO._,_R._                       I would oblige you
6150,_RICARDO._,But for the rules you speak of. Were’t not better
6151,_RICARDO._,We should go in? ’tis midnight.
6152,_RICARDO._,
6153,_RICARDO._,"_N._                          Oh, I could sit"
6154,_RICARDO._,And sigh beneath that window all the night.
6155,_RICARDO._,"Is there not wondrous softness in the thought,"
6156,_RICARDO._,That she one loves is sleeping?
6157,_RICARDO._,
6158,_RICARDO._,_R._                          I will leave you
6159,_RICARDO._,To your love thoughts.
6160,_RICARDO._,
6161,_RICARDO._,"_N._                 Nay, nay, no reason, sir."
6162,_RICARDO._,I have full leisure for sweet meditation.
6163,_RICARDO._,I will go in with you. ’Tis a rich comfort      1190

6192,_RICARDO._,_D._                                   Your singing?
6193,_RICARDO._,How musical the world is now-a-days—
6194,_RICARDO._,Yet I heard not your singing.
6195,_RICARDO._,
6196,_RICARDO._,_R._                        I am very glad:
6197,_RICARDO._,I feared I had offended. For myself

6219,_RICARDO._,
6220,_RICARDO._,"_R._ I too thought that his love was folly, lady,"
6221,_RICARDO._,Till I came here: but now I know he is wise.
6222,_RICARDO._,
6223,_RICARDO._,_D._ I half suspect he sent you here to try me
6224,_RICARDO._,With soft insinuations.
6225,_RICARDO._,
6226,_RICARDO._,_R._                  ’Twere his wish
6227,_RICARDO._,I do not doubt: although he spake no word      1220
6228,_RICARDO._,"That I could wrest to such instruction, madam."
6229,_RICARDO._,
6230,_RICARDO._,_D._ You serve him well.
6231,_RICARDO._,
6232,_RICARDO._,_R._                   May all your servants ever
6233,_RICARDO._,Love you as I do him. Yet that’s too much.
6234,_RICARDO._,
6235,_RICARDO._,_D._ ’Tis all too much. But I can truly boast
6236,_RICARDO._,I have very faithful servants. There’s Sir Gregory:
6237,_RICARDO._,I think you could not better him at Milan.
6238,_RICARDO._,What say you?
6239,_RICARDO._,
6240,_RICARDO._,_R._        Sir Gregory is the very mirror
6241,_RICARDO._,Of knightly reverence.
6242,_RICARDO._,
6243,_RICARDO._,_D._                 He is sadly deaf.
6244,_RICARDO._,Then there’s my secretary.
6245,_RICARDO._,
6246,_RICARDO._,_R._                     Your secretary?
6247,_RICARDO._,
6248,_RICARDO._,_D._ Frederick.
6249,_RICARDO._,
6250,_RICARDO._,"_R._          Ah, Frederick: on so short acquaintance"
6251,_RICARDO._,How can I judge?
6252,_RICARDO._,
6253,_RICARDO._,_D._           You have a faculty      1231
6254,_RICARDO._,"Of observation, which I am pleased to prove:"
6255,_RICARDO._,"Besides, since you are a stranger,—as you note"
6256,_RICARDO._,"Our clocks,—your eyes, no doubt, while yet they are fresh,"
6257,_RICARDO._,"Will pounce upon a thousand little things,"
6258,_RICARDO._,"Which we are blind to, seeing every day."
6259,_RICARDO._,Tell me your first impression.
6260,_RICARDO._,
6261,_RICARDO._,_R._                         Your ladyship
6262,_RICARDO._,"Would never task me thus, but in security"
6263,_RICARDO._,Of finding perfect praise. I’ll rather think
6264,_RICARDO._,"You ask me my opinion, as do poets,      1240"
6265,_RICARDO._,To judge of my capacity.
6266,_RICARDO._,
6267,_RICARDO._,"_D._                   Nay, nay."
6268,_RICARDO._,Nor will I force your flattery. Speak your mind.
6269,_RICARDO._,I hold him not in wondrous estimation.
6270,_RICARDO._,What of his person?
6271,_RICARDO._,
6272,_RICARDO._,"_R._              He has a good deportment,"
6273,_RICARDO._,Yet stoops a little.
6274,_RICARDO._,
6275,_RICARDO._,_D._               You have a soldier’s eye.
6276,_RICARDO._,"He is tall, and hath the scholar’s negligence."
6277,_RICARDO._,A martial stiffness were much out of place.
6278,_RICARDO._,
6279,_RICARDO._,_R._ True: and his open grace seems less a manner
6280,_RICARDO._,Than very nature; being itself unlinked
6281,_RICARDO._,With any distant bearing.
6282,_RICARDO._,
6283,_RICARDO._,_D._                    Now you teach me.      1250
6284,_RICARDO._,You might have known him long to hit him so.
6285,_RICARDO._,Have you talked with him much?
6286,_RICARDO._,
6287,_RICARDO._,_R._                         Enough to prove him
6288,_RICARDO._,A most ingenious gentleman.
6289,_RICARDO._,
6290,_RICARDO._,_D._                      Ah!—ingenious!
6291,_RICARDO._,Ingenious;—that is a doubtful word.
6292,_RICARDO._,You do not mean contriving?
6293,_RICARDO._,
6294,_RICARDO._,_Enter F. and T. in their travelling costume as before._
6295,_RICARDO._,
6296,_RICARDO._,"_R._ See, madam: ’tis he that comes."
6297,_RICARDO._,(_Aside._) Her love is but a fancy; else would she never
6298,_RICARDO._,"Provoke discussion on him, and seek to praise him.—"
6299,_RICARDO._,
6300,_RICARDO._,_D._ Frederick: returned so soon!—miraculous.
6301,_RICARDO._,Such expedition. Thou canst scarce have rested.
6302,_RICARDO._,’Tis two hours ere thy time.
6303,_RICARDO._,
6304,_FREDERICK._,_FREDERICK._
6305,_FREDERICK._,
6306,_FREDERICK._,’Twas my good fortune      1260
6307,_FREDERICK._,To meet no hindrance.
6308,_FREDERICK._,
6309,_FREDERICK._,"_D._                But thy health, good servant;"
6310,_FREDERICK._,Thy sickness?
6311,_FREDERICK._,
6312,_FREDERICK._,"_F._        Madam, let my quick despatch"
6313,_FREDERICK._,Bury my late reluctance. I confess
6314,_FREDERICK._,"I was unreasonable. Indeed, the journey"
6315,_FREDERICK._,Hath quite restored my spirits.
6316,_FREDERICK._,
6317,_FREDERICK._,"_D._                          Yes, so it seems."
6318,_FREDERICK._,I hoped that it might be so. Hast thou my answer?
6319,_FREDERICK._,
6320,_FREDERICK._,_F._ ’Tis here. (_Handing letter._)
6321,_FREDERICK._,
6322,_FREDERICK._,_D._          Thou must have roused the Duke from sleep.
6323,_FREDERICK._,
6324,_FREDERICK._,_F._ ’Twas such an hour as one might look to find
6325,_FREDERICK._,A duke a-bed.
6326,_FREDERICK._,
6327,_FREDERICK._,"_D._        And he was not? Pray, tell us"
6328,_FREDERICK._,Exactly how he was employed.
6329,_FREDERICK._,
6330,_FREDERICK._,_F._                       I chanced      1270
6331,_FREDERICK._,To find him banqueting in merry company;
6332,_FREDERICK._,"Such as make war on night, and march their force"
6333,_FREDERICK._,"Across the frontier, for a long campaign"
6334,_FREDERICK._,In the enemy’s country.
6335,_FREDERICK._,
6336,_FREDERICK._,"_D._ (_to R._).       Banqueting, you hear."
6337,_FREDERICK._,And at that hour.
6338,_FREDERICK._,
6339,_FREDERICK._,_F._            All night they kept it up.
6340,_FREDERICK._,
6341,_FREDERICK._,_D._ (_to R._). Hark you.
6342,_FREDERICK._,
6343,_FREDERICK._,"_R._                    I hear and wonder. (_To F._) Say you, sir,"
6344,_FREDERICK._,"The Duke was merry, that he held a feast"
6345,_FREDERICK._,Within the palace?
6346,_FREDERICK._,
6347,_FREDERICK._,_F._ (_aside_).  Heavens!—how I have blundered!
6348,_FREDERICK._,"Nay, sir, I said not so: I said expressly,"
6349,_FREDERICK._,"Or should have said, he was another’s guest.      1280"
6350,_FREDERICK._,
6351,_FREDERICK._,_R._ And yet I have never known him....
6352,_FREDERICK._,
6353,_FREDERICK._,_F._                              Indeed ’tis true:
6354,_FREDERICK._,He said to me himself those very words.
6355,_FREDERICK._,"I have never known myself do this, he said."
6356,_FREDERICK._,
6357,_FREDERICK._,_TRISTRAM_ (_aside_).
6358,_FREDERICK._,
6359,_FREDERICK._,"Now, they are at their fooling again, and not a single"
6360,_FREDERICK._,word of any sense. ’Tis enough to drive a man mad
6361,_FREDERICK._,with bewilderment.
6362,_FREDERICK._,
6363,_FREDERICK._,_R._ (_to D._). To plunge into distraction so unwonted
6364,_FREDERICK._,Argues despair. Grave men use dissipation
6365,_FREDERICK._,To drown their misery.
6366,_FREDERICK._,
6367,_FREDERICK._,_D._                 No doubt: and yet
6368,_FREDERICK._,Answer not for him.
6369,_FREDERICK._,
6370,_FREDERICK._,"_F._              True it is, my lady,"
6371,_FREDERICK._,He did confess as much to me a stranger.      1290
6372,_FREDERICK._,"Despair;—that was his word. He seemed, withal,"
6373,_FREDERICK._,Wondrously put out at all I chanced to say:
6374,_FREDERICK._,And very sick he looked.
6375,_FREDERICK._,
6376,_FREDERICK._,_T._ (_aside_). Madness and lies! I’ll hear no more of
6377,_FREDERICK._,this. (_Goes aside to Flora._)
6378,_FREDERICK._,
6379,_FREDERICK._,_D._ It seems that dissipation
6380,_FREDERICK._,Agrees not with grave men.
6381,_FREDERICK._,
6382,_FREDERICK._,_R._                     Heaven smite me dead
6383,_FREDERICK._,If I protest not ’gainst the wrong you do him.
6384,_FREDERICK._,
6385,_FREDERICK._,"_D._ So hot!—Well, thrash this out between yourselves:"
6386,_FREDERICK._,"’Tis nought to me. And, Frederick, when you have dressed,"
6387,_FREDERICK._,"Rested, and breakfasted, attend me here.      1300"
6388,_FREDERICK._,I thank you for your service.
6389,_FREDERICK._,
6390,_FREDERICK._,"_F._                        You are welcome, madam,"
6391,_FREDERICK._,To all such offices. (_Going._)
6392,_FREDERICK._,
6393,_FREDERICK._,_D._               Please leave your servant.
6394,_FREDERICK._,I have some papers ready indoors to send you.
6395,_FREDERICK._,
6396,_FREDERICK._,_F._ I thank you.      [_Exit._
6397,_FREDERICK._,
6398,_FREDERICK._,_R._            I crave permission: I would follow
6399,_FREDERICK._,To ask of my particular affairs;
6400,_FREDERICK._,How they are spoke of whence he comes.
6401,_FREDERICK._,
6402,_FREDERICK._,_D._ (_bowing permission_).          I hope
6403,_FREDERICK._,You will hear good.
6404,_FREDERICK._,
6405,_FREDERICK._,"_R._ (_aside, going_). My Frederick needs fresh prompting."
6406,_FREDERICK._,"He is so preoccupied in his own love,"
6407,_FREDERICK._,That I am forgotten.      [_Exit._
6408,_FREDERICK._,
6409,_FREDERICK._,_Diana opens the letter._
6410,_FREDERICK._,
6411,_FREDERICK._,"_T._ (_to Fl., shewing and shaking purse_). Look here! Listen here!"
6412,_FREDERICK._,
6413,_FLORA._,_FLORA._
6414,_FLORA._,
6415,_FLORA._,What have you there?      1310
6416,_FLORA._,
6417,_FLORA._,"_T._ Money,—ducats: all ducats."
6418,_FLORA._,
6419,_FLORA._,"_D._ (_reading aloud_). _I could not have chosen, among"
6420,_FLORA._,"all my friends, one more discreet and serviceable than is"
6421,_FLORA._,Ricardo. There is nothing so difficult that he has not experience
6422,_FLORA._,for it ... nothing so private but that he may not
6423,_FLORA._,well be trusted with it.... He has been accustomed to
6424,_FLORA._,manage all my affairs...._
6425,_FLORA._,
6426,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ (_to T._). But where did you get them, Tristram?"
6427,_FLORA._,
6428,_FLORA._,_T._ Ah! She gave them me.
6429,_FLORA._,
6430,_FLORA._,_Fl._ The Countess! What for?      1320
6431,_FLORA._,
6432,_FLORA._,_T._ Secrets: and there’s more where they came from.
6433,_FLORA._,
6434,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ More secrets, or more ducats?"
6435,_FLORA._,
6436,_FLORA._,"_T._ Both,—plenty of both."
6437,_FLORA._,
6438,_FLORA._,_Fl._ How nice for us.
6439,_FLORA._,
6440,_FLORA._,_T._ Us! Who d’you mean by us?
6441,_FLORA._,
6442,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ I mean when we are married, Tristram."
6443,_FLORA._,
6444,_FLORA._,"_T._ Married, say you, now? I thought you had not"
6445,_FLORA._,promised. When I had no money you hung off. Now
6446,_FLORA._,"you see me as rich as Plutarch, you’re quick enough."
6447,_FLORA._,But it’s a hoax. I filled this bag with curtain-rings to
6448,_FLORA._,deceive you: and where are you now?
6449,_FLORA._,
6450,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ O, Tristram, let me see."
6451,_FLORA._,
6452,_FLORA._,_D._ Tristram!
6453,_FLORA._,
6454,_FLORA._,_T._         Your ladyship!
6455,_FLORA._,
6456,_FLORA._,_D._                      I’ll speak with you.
6457,_FLORA._,"Flora, depart.      [_Exit Flora._"
6458,_FLORA._,
6459,_FLORA._,"Now, Tristram, tell me shortly,"
6460,_FLORA._,What you have learned.
6461,_FLORA._,
6462,_FLORA._,"_T._                 I have found a letter, madam,"
6463,_FLORA._,Writ by the lady. (_fumbles for it._)
6464,_FLORA._,
6465,_FLORA._,_D._            Indeed!—that is good news.      1341
6466,_FLORA._,Nothing could please me better. In so short time
6467,_FLORA._,"This is done excellently. Who is she, Tristram?"
6468,_FLORA._,
6469,_FLORA._,_T._ I think she is chained up somewhere in the court.
6470,_FLORA._,
6471,_FLORA._,_D._ Chained in the court! What mean you?
6472,_FLORA._,
6473,_FLORA._,"_T._                                    Here ’tis, my lady:"
6474,_FLORA._,Read for yourself. (_giving._)
6475,_FLORA._,
6476,_FLORA._,_D._             Why this is poetry;
6477,_FLORA._,And in St. Nicholas’hand.
6478,_FLORA._,
6479,_FLORA._,_T._                     I hope and trust
6480,_FLORA._,Your ladyship will not take his part.
6481,_FLORA._,
6482,_FLORA._,_D._                                His part!
6483,_FLORA._,What does this mean?
6484,_FLORA._,
6485,_FLORA._,_T._               I picked that up in the garden:
6486,_FLORA._,"St. Nicholas found me with it, and said ’twas his."
6487,_FLORA._,"I stood by it firmly ’twas the lady’s piece,      1350"
6488,_FLORA._,And written to my master. He called me a thief;
6489,_FLORA._,And if your ladyship....
6490,_FLORA._,
6491,_FLORA._,"_D._                   Stay, Tristram, stay."
6492,_FLORA._,"This paper is nothing: take it, and right yourself,"
6493,_FLORA._,"As best you are able, with St. Nicholas...."
6494,_FLORA._,Tell me now all that happened on the journey
6495,_FLORA._,I sent you last night with your master.
6496,_FLORA._,
6497,_FLORA._,_T._                                  Your ladyship
6498,_FLORA._,Sent him?
6499,_FLORA._,
6500,_FLORA._,_D._    Of course. I sent you both to Milan.
6501,_FLORA._,When did you arrive there?
6502,_FLORA._,
6503,_FLORA._,_T._                     At Milan! Is’t possible
6504,_FLORA._,Your ladyship should think I have been to Milan?
6505,_FLORA._,
6506,_FLORA._,_D._ Not been to Milan?
6507,_FLORA._,
6508,_FLORA._,_T._                  Me!
6509,_FLORA._,
6510,_FLORA._,_D._                    You accompanied      1360
6511,_FLORA._,Your master?
6512,_FLORA._,
6513,_FLORA._,_T._       I did.
6514,_FLORA._,
6515,_FLORA._,_D._ (_holding R.'s letter_). And he has been to Milan.
6516,_FLORA._,
6517,_FLORA._,"_T._ It’s true, your ladyship, I understand"
6518,_FLORA._,"Nothing my master says, and very little"
6519,_FLORA._,Of what you say to him: and if you say
6520,_FLORA._,"He 'as been to Milan, I’ll not meddle with it."
6521,_FLORA._,"But if you say that I have been to Milan,"
6522,_FLORA._,I am very much deceived. I do not like
6523,_FLORA._,That any man should think such things of me;
6524,_FLORA._,"That I can go and not go, and be here"
6525,_FLORA._,And there at once.
6526,_FLORA._,
6527,_FLORA._,"_D._             Stay, Tristram; tell me plainly      1370"
6528,_FLORA._,All that your master has done since yesterday.
6529,_FLORA._,
6530,_FLORA._,"_T._ Well, first I found him with another letter,"
6531,_FLORA._,All sighs and groans: then suddenly he bade me
6532,_FLORA._,"Order the horses, and prepare myself"
6533,_FLORA._,To drive with him to the devil at six o’clock.
6534,_FLORA._,At six we started on the Milan road
6535,_FLORA._,And came by dark to Asti; there we changed
6536,_FLORA._,Both horses and postilions and drove on:
6537,_FLORA._,"And after three hours’jolting, when I guessed"
6538,_FLORA._,"We should be nearing Milan, the coach stopped"
6539,_FLORA._,"In a ferny glade, and we got out; and then      1381"
6540,_FLORA._,"I saw we were at Belflor, and the trees"
6541,_FLORA._,Were in your ladyship’s park.
6542,_FLORA._,
6543,_FLORA._,_D._                        Ah! Then what did he?
6544,_FLORA._,
6545,_FLORA._,"_T._ Came in and locked the gate of the park behind us,"
6546,_FLORA._,"And sent me on to his room, and bade me wait"
6547,_FLORA._,Till he should come.
6548,_FLORA._,
6549,_FLORA._,_D._               What hour was that?
6550,_FLORA._,
6551,_FLORA._,_T._                                 Eleven.
6552,_FLORA._,
6553,_FLORA._,"_D._ (_aside_). The hour, no doubt, when he should meet his mistress—"
6554,_FLORA._,When came he in?
6555,_FLORA._,
6556,_FLORA._,_T._           By midnight.
6557,_FLORA._,
6558,_FLORA._,_D._                      He locked the gate....
6559,_FLORA._,The lady is in the palace.
6560,_FLORA._,
6561,_FLORA._,_T._                     So he pretends.
6562,_FLORA._,
6563,_FLORA._,_D._ He let slip nothing on the journey?
6564,_FLORA._,
6565,_FLORA._,_T._                                   He lit      1390
6566,_FLORA._,"A pocket-lamp, and sat, mute as a fish,"
6567,_FLORA._,"Counting the minutes on his watch; and then,"
6568,_FLORA._,"As if it served as well to tell the time,"
6569,_FLORA._,"He fetched the jewelled portrait from his breast,"
6570,_FLORA._,And gazed on that.
6571,_FLORA._,
6572,_FLORA._,_D._               A portrait?
6573,_FLORA._,
6574,_FLORA._,_T._                         Certainly.
6575,_FLORA._,
6576,_FLORA._,"_D._ Carries he a portrait, say you?"
6577,_FLORA._,
6578,_FLORA._,_T._                               Certainly.
6579,_FLORA._,
6580,_FLORA._,_D._ You know not who ’tis of?
6581,_FLORA._,
6582,_FLORA._,"_T._                         Not I, my lady."
6583,_FLORA._,
6584,_FLORA._,_D._ Could you get sight of it?
6585,_FLORA._,
6586,_FLORA._,_T._                          Impossible.
6587,_FLORA._,"At night ’tis neath his pillow, and all the day"
6588,_FLORA._,He keeps it in a little special pocket      1400
6589,_FLORA._,"In his doublet here, just under his heart; or if"
6590,_FLORA._,"He pulls it out, he holds it by his chin"
6591,_FLORA._,Where none may see.
6592,_FLORA._,
6593,_FLORA._,"_D._              You should have told me of this,"
6594,_FLORA._,This portrait: have you no guess who ’tis of?
6595,_FLORA._,
6596,_FLORA._,"_T._ I guess ’tis part of the pretence, my lady;"
6597,_FLORA._,For when the fit is on he’ll talk to it:
6598,_FLORA._,And once I saw him kiss it.
6599,_FLORA._,
6600,_FLORA._,"_D._                      Thank you, Tristram."
6601,_FLORA._,Take now these papers to your master at once
6602,_FLORA._,And tell him....
6603,_FLORA._,
6604,_FLORA._,"_T._ (_going_).  I will, your ladyship."
6605,_FLORA._,
6606,_FLORA._,_D._                                  Stay yet....
6607,_FLORA._,"This letter which he brought me, did you see      1410"
6608,_FLORA._,Whence he procured it?
6609,_FLORA._,
6610,_FLORA._,"_T._                 I suppose, my lady,"
6611,_FLORA._,"He wrote it himself, no doubt of it. Where else"
6612,_FLORA._,Should he have got it?
6613,_FLORA._,
6614,_FLORA._,"_D._                 Tell Ricardo, Tristram,"
6615,_FLORA._,"I wish to see him here, at once. Your master"
6616,_FLORA._,May wait on me at noon.
6617,_FLORA._,
6618,_FLORA._,_T._                  About that gentleman....
6619,_FLORA._,
6620,_FLORA._,"_D._ Begone, and do my bidding.      [_Exit T._"
6621,_FLORA._,They have met in spite of me—they have met: and he
6622,_FLORA._,Hath dared to disobey me and lie to my face.
6623,_FLORA._,Who can it be? who is she? she is in my house....
6624,_FLORA._,Ah! what a prey I have netted! One of my maids....
6625,_FLORA._,"One of my maids, it must be.... O detestation!      1421"
6626,_FLORA._,"And he hath her portrait. Ah, he loves, he loves."
6627,_FLORA._,"The love that taught me to dissemble and scheme,"
6628,_FLORA._,Hath taught him to meet plot with counterplot.—
6629,_FLORA._,"Frederick, dear Frederick! ’tis unworthy of you:"
6630,_FLORA._,This is too hard upon me.... I loved you well.
6631,_FLORA._,"Shame, shame, shame, shame! Indeed he cannot know"
6632,_FLORA._,How much I love him ... he cannot. Am I too old
6633,_FLORA._,At twenty-seven? out-matched! I had taken too
6634,_FLORA._,This letter for the Duke’s. Ho! the insolence      1430
6635,_FLORA._,To assume his fulsomeness! to forge in terms
6636,_FLORA._,"Of a humble obedient lover, so he might"
6637,_FLORA._,"Keep tryst with.... O shame, shame! and then to write it"
6638,_FLORA._,"He must have broke my seal, and read my letter—"
6639,_FLORA._,He has gone too far: here is a slip in honour
6640,_FLORA._,"Which I may work on. I’ll not give him up,"
6641,_FLORA._,Not yet. He can be shamed: and first I’ll prove
6642,_FLORA._,"The forgery, and then wring confession from him."
6643,_FLORA._,’Tis well I have at hand so trusty a witness.
6644,_FLORA._,
6645,_FLORA._,_Re-enter Ricardo._
6646,_FLORA._,
6647,_FLORA._,_R._ Your ladyship sent for me.
6648,_FLORA._,
6649,_FLORA._,"_D._                          I did, Ricardo.      1440"
6650,_FLORA._,"In answer to the favour, which most gladly"
6651,_FLORA._,"I do you at the Duke’s request, I beg"
6652,_FLORA._,A service for myself.
6653,_FLORA._,
6654,_FLORA._,_R._                My honoured master
6655,_FLORA._,"Commands me, lady; and you command my master."
6656,_FLORA._,I am twice yours.
6657,_FLORA._,
6658,_FLORA._,_D._            Again! well—Look at this!
6659,_FLORA._,Is this your famous master’s writing? Look.
6660,_FLORA._,You know it? (_giving letter._)
6661,_FLORA._,
6662,_FLORA._,_R._       As my own.
6663,_FLORA._,
6664,_FLORA._,_D._                  Is that then his?
6665,_FLORA._,
6666,_FLORA._,"_R._                                  It is,"
6667,_FLORA._,And writ his best.
6668,_FLORA._,
6669,_FLORA._,"_D._             Why, ’tis a forgery,"
6670,_FLORA._,And you are deceived.
6671,_FLORA._,
6672,_FLORA._,"_R._                Nay, ’tis no forgery."
6673,_FLORA._,
6674,_FLORA._,_D._ You are certain?      1450
6675,_FLORA._,
6676,_FLORA._,_R._                Certain.
6677,_FLORA._,
6678,_FLORA._,"_D._                       You may read it through,"
6679,_FLORA._,"Though ’tis about yourself. Examine it well,"
6680,_FLORA._,If ’tis authentic. You will only find
6681,_FLORA._,Prodigal praise to make you blush.
6682,_FLORA._,
6683,_FLORA._,_R._ (_aside_).                  No wonder
6684,_FLORA._,"If I do blush, faced with my own device."
6685,_FLORA._,"(_aloud, giving back._) I’ll strive to make this good."
6686,_FLORA._,
6687,_FLORA._,_D._                    And ’tis his hand?
6688,_FLORA._,
6689,_FLORA._,_R._ It is.
6690,_FLORA._,
6691,_FLORA._,"_D._      I am glad, because it came as answer"
6692,_FLORA._,"To a letter I wrote but yesterday, and gave"
6693,_FLORA._,"To Frederick, ordering him to ride to Milan"
6694,_FLORA._,"And give it the Duke. This morning, as you saw,"
6695,_FLORA._,He hands me this. His servant who was with him
6696,_FLORA._,"Tells me that he has not been to Milan at all,      1461"
6697,_FLORA._,But slept in the court.
6698,_FLORA._,
6699,_FLORA._,_R._ (_aside_).       Pest on that sneaking dolt!
6700,_FLORA._,
6701,_FLORA._,_D._ What say you now?
6702,_FLORA._,
6703,_FLORA._,_R._ May he not have used some other messenger?
6704,_FLORA._,"I had my doubts when he brought in his tale,"
6705,_FLORA._,That history of the banquet.—Did I not say
6706,_FLORA._,The Duke was wronged?
6707,_FLORA._,
6708,_FLORA._,"_D._                True, true; and tho’I am glad"
6709,_FLORA._,"He is quit of forgery, he is not of lying."
6710,_FLORA._,What can I think?
6711,_FLORA._,
6712,_FLORA._,_R._            I thought your ladyship      1469
6713,_FLORA._,Trusted in Frederick wholly. When this morning
6714,_FLORA._,You praised him to me....
6715,_FLORA._,
6716,_FLORA._,"_D._                    Praised him! stay, I beg:"
6717,_FLORA._,"I praised him not, save to draw words from you."
6718,_FLORA._,And you described him well; did not you say
6719,_FLORA._,He was contriving?
6720,_FLORA._,
6721,_FLORA._,_R._             Then you trust him not?
6722,_FLORA._,
6723,_FLORA._,"_D._ See how he acts. Ah, if I told you all!"
6724,_FLORA._,And yet to tell argues much confidence....
6725,_FLORA._,
6726,_FLORA._,(_Ricardo is silent and Diana continues._)
6727,_FLORA._,
6728,_FLORA._,"I have strange sympathies, affinities,"
6729,_FLORA._,"Magnetic or electric it may be,"
6730,_FLORA._,Which rule my trust and liking: if all feel them
6731,_FLORA._,I cannot say: in me they are intimations      1480
6732,_FLORA._,Of supernatural efficacy: I find
6733,_FLORA._,My first impressions never prompt me wrong.
6734,_FLORA._,"Some men I see only to avoid,—You know"
6735,_FLORA._,A strong example of that;—on the other hand
6736,_FLORA._,"There are some faces,—eyes, I think,—that draw me"
6737,_FLORA._,At first encounter; so that I often fancy
6738,_FLORA._,There must be a subtle emanation thrown
6739,_FLORA._,"By the spirit, as light from fire. Now yesterday"
6740,_FLORA._,"When I saw you, I felt the secret shock"
6741,_FLORA._,Which told me I was in presence of a soul      1490
6742,_FLORA._,"In harmony with mine, one I could trust,"
6743,_FLORA._,If I should need a friend: and when I wrote
6744,_FLORA._,"To the Duke, it was not that my judgment wanted"
6745,_FLORA._,The assurance which his letter gives. I knew
6746,_FLORA._,"How it would be.—I hardly think, Ricardo,"
6747,_FLORA._,"That, had I asked for his own character,"
6748,_FLORA._,Your master could have writ more praise.
6749,_FLORA._,
6750,_FLORA._,_R._                                   I wish
6751,_FLORA._,"To please my lady, as I have pleased the Duke."
6752,_FLORA._,I have kept his secrets.
6753,_FLORA._,
6754,_FLORA._,_D._                   I shall tell you mine.
6755,_FLORA._,Frederick hath had for some time an intrigue      1500
6756,_FLORA._,"With a lady—you understand,—a liberty"
6757,_FLORA._,"I never have allowed, nor will: besides"
6758,_FLORA._,In him ’tis most intolerable....
6759,_FLORA._,Now yesterday it chanced I came to learn
6760,_FLORA._,He had made appointment with this certain person
6761,_FLORA._,To meet by night: I know not who she is;
6762,_FLORA._,"But, wishing to prevent it, I contrived"
6763,_FLORA._,To send him on my message to the Duke;
6764,_FLORA._,With what result you have heard.
6765,_FLORA._,
6766,_FLORA._,"_R._                           The Duke, my lady,"
6767,_FLORA._,Is the only gainer here.
6768,_FLORA._,
6769,_FLORA._,_D._                   And are not you?      1510
6770,_FLORA._,
6771,_FLORA._,"_R._ Yes, I too, if I am raised in your esteem."
6772,_FLORA._,
6773,_FLORA._,_D._ Then you must help me.
6774,_FLORA._,
6775,_FLORA._,_R._                      I can truly vouch
6776,_FLORA._,Your ladyship has read my heart and soul.
6777,_FLORA._,I feel heaven-drawn to serve you to the death.
6778,_FLORA._,What is’t to do?
6779,_FLORA._,
6780,_FLORA._,_D._           Only seek out this matter
6781,_FLORA._,For me; discover who this lady is.
6782,_FLORA._,For private reasons I feel justified
6783,_FLORA._,In using any means to learn the truth
6784,_FLORA._,Dishonestly held from me by my servant:      1519
6785,_FLORA._,And so I have questioned Tristram. He assures me
6786,_FLORA._,"They met last night: but he is profoundly dull,"
6787,_FLORA._,And not in Frederick’s confidence.
6788,_FLORA._,
6789,_FLORA._,_R._                             Has he no notion
6790,_FLORA._,How Frederick got this letter?
6791,_FLORA._,
6792,_FLORA._,_D._                         No.
6793,_FLORA._,
6794,_FLORA._,_R._                           Nor a hint
6795,_FLORA._,Of this mysterious lady?
6796,_FLORA._,
6797,_FLORA._,_D._                   He cannot help you.
6798,_FLORA._,
6799,_FLORA._,_R._ Your ladyship must have a near suspicion.
6800,_FLORA._,
6801,_FLORA._,_D._ Only a suspicion that’s unfit to tell.
6802,_FLORA._,
6803,_FLORA._,_Enter Laura._
6804,_FLORA._,
6805,_FLORA._,"Here is my sister, whom I wish to question."
6806,_FLORA._,Come to me soon again; I have meanwhile
6807,_FLORA._,Myself a stroke to play. When we next meet
6808,_FLORA._,I may know more.      1530
6809,_FLORA._,
6810,_FLORA._,_R._           Your most devoted servant.      [_Exit._
6811,_FLORA._,
6812,_FLORA._,"_D._ Good morning, dearest Laura."
6813,_FLORA._,
6814,_LAURA._,_LAURA._
6815,_LAURA._,
6816,_LAURA._,"Good morning, sister."
6817,_LAURA._,
6818,_LAURA._,_D._ Did you sleep well last night?
6819,_LAURA._,
6820,_LAURA._,_L._                              I slept till nine.
6821,_LAURA._,
6822,_LAURA._,_D._ What hour went you to bed?
6823,_LAURA._,
6824,_LAURA._,_L._                          Not very late....
6825,_LAURA._,
6826,_LAURA._,_D._ Nay: but what hour?—before eleven?
6827,_LAURA._,
6828,_LAURA._,_L._ (_aside_).                        What’s this?
6829,_LAURA._,Are we discovered?
6830,_LAURA._,
6831,_LAURA._,_D._             Was it before eleven?
6832,_LAURA._,
6833,_LAURA._,"_L._ I cannot tell. Why do you ask, Diana?"
6834,_LAURA._,What is it has happened?
6835,_LAURA._,
6836,_LAURA._,"_D._                   Answer me, I beg,"
6837,_LAURA._,And you shall know. About that hour of the night
6838,_LAURA._,Did you hear any noise?
6839,_LAURA._,
6840,_LAURA._,_L._ (_aside_). Ricardo’s singing.—
6841,_LAURA._,What kind of noise?
6842,_LAURA._,
6843,_LAURA._,"_D._              Why, any noise, between      1540"
6844,_LAURA._,Eleven and midnight.
6845,_LAURA._,
6846,_LAURA._,_L._               Did you hear a noise?
6847,_LAURA._,
6848,_LAURA._,_D._ No: but did you?
6849,_LAURA._,
6850,_LAURA._,_L._                O no: I heard no noise.
6851,_LAURA._,What made you think there was a noise?
6852,_LAURA._,
6853,_LAURA._,_D._                                 I have reason.
6854,_LAURA._,
6855,_LAURA._,_L._ Was there a robbery?
6856,_LAURA._,
6857,_LAURA._,_D._                    Nay: no robbery.
6858,_LAURA._,"And yet there was, Laura, a robbery:"
6859,_LAURA._,"Of honour,—our honour,—of woman’s honour."
6860,_LAURA._,"Laura, thou knowest the sacredness of love:"
6861,_LAURA._,Love is the one thing in the world which women
6862,_LAURA._,Must guard from profanation; for by love
6863,_LAURA._,"They rule; and if they trifle with their power,      1550"
6864,_LAURA._,"They come to be men’s chattels, not their queens."
6865,_LAURA._,"Thou’lt soon be married, Laura, and I can talk"
6866,_LAURA._,Freely of these things: I have taught thee the religious
6867,_LAURA._,And philosophic doctrines; but to-day
6868,_LAURA._,"We deal with facts. And first, then, I rejoice"
6869,_LAURA._,"Thy husband will be a man whom thou wilt rule,"
6870,_LAURA._,"One who adores thee reverently, who holds"
6871,_LAURA._,"Of love, as I, and with some special fancy:—"
6872,_LAURA._,"He is quite a poet.—Why, now, shouldst thou smile?"
6873,_LAURA._,"Thou hast no taste in poetry, but suppose      1560"
6874,_LAURA._,"St. Nicholas had lacked that inner sight,"
6875,_LAURA._,Had fancied thee merely because he thought thee
6876,_LAURA._,"A fine girl, and had used the common tricks"
6877,_LAURA._,"Of odious trifling, till he dared to kiss thee,"
6878,_LAURA._,"And meet thee alone, and put his arm about thee...."
6879,_LAURA._,
6880,_LAURA._,"_L._ Good heavens, Diana! I hope you do not think"
6881,_LAURA._,He has ever done so.
6882,_LAURA._,
6883,_LAURA._,_D._               No: of course he wouldn’t.
6884,_LAURA._,But ’tis a fact men do such things; and that
6885,_LAURA._,Not with one woman only. And ’tis true
6886,_LAURA._,That there are ladies who admit the addresses      1570
6887,_LAURA._,Of more than one man.
6888,_LAURA._,
6889,_LAURA._,_L._                O Diana!
6890,_LAURA._,
6891,_LAURA._,"_D._                       Indeed,"
6892,_LAURA._,’Tis true: and women are to blame if men
6893,_LAURA._,Make them their sport. Thou’rt shocked: but ’tis a fact
6894,_LAURA._,That this detested pestilence invades
6895,_LAURA._,"Earth’s every nook: my palace doors and bolts,"
6896,_LAURA._,"My strong precautions, my well-known regard"
6897,_LAURA._,"For strictness, my injunctions, my example,"
6898,_LAURA._,Cannot expel it.
6899,_LAURA._,
6900,_LAURA._,"_L._           Pray, Diana, tell me"
6901,_LAURA._,What it is: you frighten me. Was any caught
6902,_LAURA._,"Breaking the rules, or is it but suspicion?      1580"
6903,_LAURA._,
6904,_LAURA._,"_D._ Of the two criminals, the man I know,"
6905,_LAURA._,"The woman I know not; but if I knew her,"
6906,_LAURA._,I am in the mood to kill her.
6907,_LAURA._,
6908,_LAURA._,"_L._ (_aside_). Thank heaven, she does not guess me—"
6909,_LAURA._,Who is the man?
6910,_LAURA._,
6911,_LAURA._,_D._ Better not ask; it matters not to thee:
6912,_LAURA._,But thou canst help me find this erring Eve.
6913,_LAURA._,If thou’st observed in any of the maids
6914,_LAURA._,"Conscious behaviour, scrupulous regard"
6915,_LAURA._,"To petty adornment, or, what most betrays,"
6916,_LAURA._,An inconsiderate blushing....
6917,_LAURA._,
6918,_LAURA._,"_L._ (_aside_).             The maids, she says!      1590"
6919,_LAURA._,One of the maids! Good heavens!—
6920,_LAURA._,
6921,_LAURA._,_D._                            Marcela:
6922,_LAURA._,Could it be she? She is handsome.
6923,_LAURA._,
6924,_LAURA._,_L._                            ’Tis not she:
6925,_LAURA._,She tells me all her secrets.
6926,_LAURA._,
6927,_LAURA._,_D._                        Dorothy?
6928,_LAURA._,
6929,_LAURA._,_L._ I do not think it.
6930,_LAURA._,
6931,_LAURA._,_D._                  Katharine?
6932,_LAURA._,
6933,_LAURA._,"_L._                           No, not Kate."
6934,_LAURA._,
6935,_LAURA._,_D._ I’ll find the traitress out.
6936,_LAURA._,
6937,_LAURA._,_L._ (_aside_).                 To save myself
6938,_LAURA._,I had best fall in with this.
6939,_LAURA._,
6940,_LAURA._,_D._                        What do you say?
6941,_LAURA._,
6942,_LAURA._,"_L._ I have not a suspicion,—but...."
6943,_LAURA._,
6944,_LAURA._,_D._                                But what?
6945,_LAURA._,What?
6946,_LAURA._,
6947,_LAURA._,_L._ If there’s any one who might be charged
6948,_LAURA._,With levity....
6949,_LAURA._,
6950,_LAURA._,_D._          Who is it?
6951,_LAURA._,
6952,_LAURA._,"_L._                    You’ll not be angry,"
6953,_LAURA._,Diana?
6954,_LAURA._,
6955,_LAURA._,_D._   Nay: but tell me.
6956,_LAURA._,
6957,_LAURA._,"_L._                   I should say,      1600"
6958,_LAURA._,"If there’s one frivolous, and more than others"
6959,_LAURA._,Unapt to profit by the rules....
6960,_LAURA._,
6961,_LAURA._,_D._                           ’Tis who?
6962,_LAURA._,
6963,_LAURA._,_L._ I think ’tis your own maid.
6964,_LAURA._,
6965,_LAURA._,_D._                           Flora?—pooh! pooh!
6966,_LAURA._,Flora’s almost a hoyden.
6967,_LAURA._,
6968,_LAURA._,_L._ (_aside_).        How stupid of me!
6969,_LAURA._,
6970,_LAURA._,"_D._ They meet at night, Laura: unless he dares"
6971,_LAURA._,"To pass my chamber-door, ’tis in the garden."
6972,_LAURA._,Your window looks that way. I thought last night
6973,_LAURA._,You might have heard them.
6974,_LAURA._,
6975,_LAURA._,"_L._                     Why, it’s very unlikely"
6976,_LAURA._,I should hear through the window.
6977,_LAURA._,
6978,_LAURA._,"_D._                            Still, your window"
6979,_LAURA._,Gives you an opportunity to watch.      1610
6980,_LAURA._,You could step out and hide in the garden.
6981,_LAURA._,
6982,_LAURA._,_L._                                     Alone?
6983,_LAURA._,
6984,_LAURA._,"_D._ I would not ask my sister to play spy,"
6985,_LAURA._,If it were possible that any scandal
6986,_LAURA._,Dared with its spotted finger point at her.
6987,_LAURA._,
6988,_LAURA._,"_L._ But who is the man, Diana?"
6989,_LAURA._,
6990,_LAURA._,"_D._                          If I tell,—"
6991,_LAURA._,"And you must know,—promise you will not breathe it."
6992,_LAURA._,
6993,_LAURA._,_L._ You need not ask.
6994,_LAURA._,
6995,_LAURA._,_D._                 ’Tis Frederick.
6996,_LAURA._,
6997,_LAURA._,_L._                               Frederick!
6998,_LAURA._,Incredible!
6999,_LAURA._,
7000,_LAURA._,"_D._      No, ’tis not incredible."
7001,_LAURA._,Nothing is incredible of any man.
7002,_LAURA._,"And, Laura, I know that he is in love. He carries"
7003,_LAURA._,A portrait of his lady in his pocket.      1621
7004,_LAURA._,
7005,_LAURA._,_L._ (_aside_). Ah!
7006,_LAURA._,
7007,_LAURA._,_D._ I’ll make an effort first to get at that.
7008,_LAURA._,"But if I fail, I must ask you to watch"
7009,_LAURA._,"To-night, just for one night, only one hour."
7010,_LAURA._,"You are trembling, Laura."
7011,_LAURA._,
7012,_LAURA._,"_L._                    So are you, Diana."
7013,_LAURA._,
7014,_LAURA._,_D._ I am angry.
7015,_LAURA._,
7016,_LAURA._,_L._           So am I.
7017,_LAURA._,
7018,_LAURA._,_D._                  No: you are frightened.
7019,_LAURA._,Dare you not watch the garden?
7020,_LAURA._,
7021,_LAURA._,_L._                         O yes: I promise
7022,_LAURA._,"I’ll watch the garden well to-night, Diana."
7023,_LAURA._,"If he should venture again, I’ll see him. I think"
7024,_LAURA._,I could wait longer than one hour.
7025,_LAURA._,
7026,_LAURA._,_D._                             Do so:      1630
7027,_LAURA._,I shall set guard within. Eleven’s the time.
7028,_LAURA._,
7029,_LAURA._,_L._ (_aside_). Could kindest ingenuity contrive
7030,_LAURA._,Better than this? But how shall I warn Frederick
7031,_LAURA._,About the picture?—
7032,_LAURA._,
7033,_LAURA._,_Enter Sir Gregory and St. Nicholas._
7034,_LAURA._,
7035,_LAURA._,"_D._ Good-morning, gentlemen. I need not ask"
7036,_LAURA._,The reason why you visit me thus early.
7037,_LAURA._,
7038,_NICHOLAS._,_NICHOLAS._
7039,_NICHOLAS._,
7040,_NICHOLAS._,Early is late to them that find their sunrise
7041,_NICHOLAS._,"In seeing thee, my lady."
7042,_NICHOLAS._,
7043,_NICHOLAS._,"_D._                   Better speak, sir,"
7044,_NICHOLAS._,Your poetry to Laura.
7045,_NICHOLAS._,
7046,_NICHOLAS._,"_N._                She is my rose,"
7047,_NICHOLAS._,"The rose of my sun’s garden-ground, and I      1640"
7048,_NICHOLAS._,The nightingale forlorn that steal to woo her.
7049,_NICHOLAS._,
7050,_NICHOLAS._,"_D._ That’s very well. But I now, by my name,"
7051,_NICHOLAS._,Should be your moon.
7052,_NICHOLAS._,
7053,_NICHOLAS._,_N._               I have a verse to fit.      [_Reciting._
7054,_NICHOLAS._,The flowers of dawn are uplifted to hear
7055,_NICHOLAS._,"The birds’enamoured tune,"
7056,_NICHOLAS._,Which tell their love in the pale ear
7057,_NICHOLAS._,Of the far-flying moon.
7058,_NICHOLAS._,
7059,_NICHOLAS._,"_D._ That’s very beautiful. Now, tell your love:"
7060,_NICHOLAS._,I fly.      [_Goes to Sir Gregory._
7061,_NICHOLAS._,"Sir Gregory, sit you to the table:"
7062,_NICHOLAS._,"These are the articles.      [_They sit, D. shews papers._"
7063,_NICHOLAS._,
7064,_GREGORY._,_GREGORY._
7065,_GREGORY._,
7066,_GREGORY._,I much regret      1650
7067,_GREGORY._,The small provision that I make for Laura.
7068,_GREGORY._,"But if St. Nicholas doth as he has promised,"
7069,_GREGORY._,That will suffice. I see the treaty lacks
7070,_GREGORY._,Nought but the seals.
7071,_GREGORY._,
7072,_GREGORY._,_D._                He will make Laura rich.
7073,_GREGORY._,
7074,_GREGORY._,"_G._ My elder brother, as your ladyship knows,"
7075,_GREGORY._,"Is childless, and next heir to such estates,"
7076,_GREGORY._,As fairly promise Laura twenty times
7077,_GREGORY._,As much as what St. Nicholas gives her now.
7078,_GREGORY._,Meanwhile we must not reckon on this chance.
7079,_GREGORY._,
7080,_GREGORY._,"_D._ Read it, Sir Gregory.      1660"
7081,_GREGORY._,
7082,_GREGORY._,"_L._ (_to N._). The day is fixed, and there my father sits"
7083,_GREGORY._,Reading the settlement: what would you more?
7084,_GREGORY._,
7085,_GREGORY._,"_N._                                       O Laura,"
7086,_GREGORY._,More gracious words. Who that now heard us talk
7087,_GREGORY._,Would guess we were to marry in two days?
7088,_GREGORY._,
7089,_GREGORY._,_L._ Maybe we are not.
7090,_GREGORY._,
7091,_GREGORY._,"_N._                 Nay, dear one, do not doubt me:"
7092,_GREGORY._,Have I not sworn my faith a thousand times?
7093,_GREGORY._,And were I an emperor....
7094,_GREGORY._,
7095,_GREGORY._,_L._                    Who wants emperors?
7096,_GREGORY._,
7097,_GREGORY._,_N._ Or even a prince.
7098,_GREGORY._,
7099,_GREGORY._,_L._                 I do not care for princes.
7100,_GREGORY._,
7101,_GREGORY._,_G._ (_aloud_). Heigh! heigh! Why this will never do.
7102,_GREGORY._,What’s this?
7103,_GREGORY._,
7104,_GREGORY._,"_N._ But what can now prevent our marriage, Laura?"
7105,_GREGORY._,
7106,_GREGORY._,"_L._ Human affairs are ever so uncertain,—      1671"
7107,_GREGORY._,"And one of us might die,—and if ’twas you,"
7108,_GREGORY._,Think how much needless sorrow I then should suffer
7109,_GREGORY._,"For having loved you now. And, seeing the risk,"
7110,_GREGORY._,’Twere scarcely prudent to commit myself
7111,_GREGORY._,More than is necessary.
7112,_GREGORY._,
7113,_GREGORY._,_N._                  O cruel wisdom!
7114,_GREGORY._,Are women all so careful of their feelings?
7115,_GREGORY._,
7116,_GREGORY._,"_G._ Why, what a blundering fellow!"
7117,_GREGORY._,
7118,_GREGORY._,"_D._                        What is’t, Sir Gregory?"
7119,_GREGORY._,
7120,_GREGORY._,_G._ Heigh!
7121,_GREGORY._,
7122,_GREGORY._,"_N._ But when we are married thou wilt love me, Laura?"
7123,_GREGORY._,
7124,_GREGORY._,"_L._ Yes, when we are married.      1680"
7125,_GREGORY._,
7126,_GREGORY._,_N._                         I can wait for that:
7127,_GREGORY._,"’Tis but two days;—and now we speak of it,"
7128,_GREGORY._,I wish that thou wouldst tell me in what colour
7129,_GREGORY._,"’Twould please thee that I dressed. Or wilt thou come,"
7130,_GREGORY._,"O’erlook the suits my tailor has prepared,"
7131,_GREGORY._,And say which pleases best.
7132,_GREGORY._,
7133,_GREGORY._,"_L._                      Sir, since you strike"
7134,_GREGORY._,"The very root of the chord, I’ll tell you how"
7135,_GREGORY._,You may best please me. There was once a man
7136,_GREGORY._,"I liked, whose custom it was to dress in black:"
7137,_GREGORY._,If you will dress like him....
7138,_GREGORY._,
7139,_GREGORY._,_N._                         In black!
7140,_GREGORY._,
7141,_GREGORY._,"_G._ (_Laura listens._)               Your ladyship,      1690"
7142,_GREGORY._,I cannot sign this contract—the provision
7143,_GREGORY._,I look for is not here; the scribe has blundered.
7144,_GREGORY._,This is no settlement at all. Who drew it?
7145,_GREGORY._,
7146,_GREGORY._,_D._ Frederick.
7147,_GREGORY._,
7148,_GREGORY._,_G._          Then he’s no lawyer. I am surprised
7149,_GREGORY._,He took this on himself.
7150,_GREGORY._,
7151,_GREGORY._,"_L._ (_aside_).        So, well done, Frederick!"
7152,_GREGORY._,
7153,_GREGORY._,"_D._ ’Tis most provoking. Are you sure, Sir Gregory,"
7154,_GREGORY._,’Tis as you say?
7155,_GREGORY._,
7156,_GREGORY._,_N._ (_to Gregory_). Will you not sign the contract?
7157,_GREGORY._,
7158,_GREGORY._,_G._ (_rising_). I cannot sign it.
7159,_GREGORY._,
7160,_GREGORY._,"_D._                             There’s a flaw, it seems,"
7161,_GREGORY._,"In the deed, St. Nicholas: but there’s time enough"
7162,_GREGORY._,"To have it drawn afresh. Pray come, Sir Gregory,"
7163,_GREGORY._,Come to my study. Here we interrupt      1701
7164,_GREGORY._,These lovers.      [_Beckons G. off. Exeunt D. and G._
7165,_GREGORY._,
7166,_GREGORY._,"_N._ Now they are gone, put off this mask."
7167,_GREGORY._,
7168,_GREGORY._,_L._                                     What mask?
7169,_GREGORY._,
7170,_GREGORY._,"_N._ Thou dost respect the Countess’eye and ear,"
7171,_GREGORY._,And wilt not love when she is by: but now
7172,_GREGORY._,Give me at least thy hand to kiss.
7173,_GREGORY._,
7174,_GREGORY._,"_L._                             Why no, sir."
7175,_GREGORY._,
7176,_GREGORY._,"_N._ Say then thou lovest me, sweetest Laura.—"
7177,_GREGORY._,
7178,_GREGORY._,"_L._ Nay, but I do not, sir. I understand"
7179,_GREGORY._,"That women love their husbands, and I promise"
7180,_GREGORY._,"To love mine when I am married; yes, as well      1710"
7181,_GREGORY._,As any happy woman on this earth
7182,_GREGORY._,Hath ever loved. Are you content with that?
7183,_GREGORY._,
7184,_GREGORY._,"_N._ I should be, Laura; but thou dost not speak"
7185,_GREGORY._,As if ’twere true. I could see well enough
7186,_GREGORY._,Thou wert not sorry when Sir Gregory said
7187,_GREGORY._,He would not sign. I know thou wilt not love me.
7188,_GREGORY._,
7189,_GREGORY._,"_L._ Then why, in heaven’s name, would you marry me?"
7190,_GREGORY._,
7191,_GREGORY._,_N._ Because I love thee. But I think no man
7192,_GREGORY._,Did ever love so cruel and strange a mistress.
7193,_GREGORY._,
7194,_GREGORY._,"_L._ And you, sir, do no less appear to me      1720"
7195,_GREGORY._,"Distrustful and impatient. Prithee go,"
7196,_GREGORY._,Busy yourself to get your clothes in fashion:
7197,_GREGORY._,In two days is my marriage; after that—
7198,_GREGORY._,
7199,_GREGORY._,_N._ Well!
7200,_GREGORY._,
7201,_GREGORY._,_L._     After that all shall seem different.
7202,_GREGORY._,
7203,_GREGORY._,"_N._ I made a sonnet of my love for thee,"
7204,_GREGORY._,And would have given it.
7205,_GREGORY._,
7206,_GREGORY._,_L._                   Why then did you not?
7207,_GREGORY._,
7208,_GREGORY._,_N._ I lost it in the garden.
7209,_GREGORY._,
7210,_GREGORY._,_L._                        It can’t be lost.
7211,_GREGORY._,
7212,_GREGORY._,_N._ No. Tristram found it and won’t give it up.
7213,_GREGORY._,He says that Frederick wrote it.
7214,_GREGORY._,
7215,_GREGORY._,"_L._                           Frederick! nonsense, sir!"
7216,_GREGORY._,Some one is coming. Excuse me.      [_Exit._      1730
7217,_GREGORY._,
7218,_GREGORY._,"_N._ O woman, various woman! thus to treat"
7219,_GREGORY._,The man she loves! and yet how well becomes thee
7220,_GREGORY._,"Thy native wit, when sweetest modesty"
7221,_GREGORY._,"Is masked thereby in tart indifference,"
7222,_GREGORY._,Which spurs far more than doting tenderness
7223,_GREGORY._,The passion it rebuffs. What wit she hath!
7224,_GREGORY._,"My Laura! Wit is admirable in woman,"
7225,_GREGORY._,It is so rare; and ’tis the salt of marriage.
7226,_GREGORY._,
7227,_GREGORY._,_Frederick and Ricardo have re-entered._
7228,_GREGORY._,
7229,_GREGORY._,"_R._ (_to F._). Here’s our belated bee, let’s go elsewhere."
7230,_GREGORY._,
7231,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Nay, drive him to his hole.      1740"
7232,_GREGORY._,
7233,_GREGORY._,"_R._                           How now, St. Nicholas!"
7234,_GREGORY._,"Musing, I think, on thy good fortune, eh?"
7235,_GREGORY._,
7236,_GREGORY._,"_N._ Good morning, Frederick, and, sir, how do you?"
7237,_GREGORY._,
7238,_GREGORY._,"_R._ Fairly, I thank thee, fairly: but in presence"
7239,_GREGORY._,"Of happiness like thine, mine goes for nothing."
7240,_GREGORY._,
7241,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Thou hast been honey-gathering early, sir."
7242,_GREGORY._,
7243,_GREGORY._,_N._ I will confess it: that was my pursuit.
7244,_GREGORY._,
7245,_GREGORY._,"_F._ True to thy beeship, thy belated beeship."
7246,_GREGORY._,
7247,_GREGORY._,_N._ Sir!
7248,_GREGORY._,
7249,_GREGORY._,_R._    I am sure our friend means no offence.
7250,_GREGORY._,The happy expressions of true genius
7251,_GREGORY._,Stick in the memory.
7252,_GREGORY._,
7253,_GREGORY._,"_F._               Yes, sir, it stuck fast,      1750"
7254,_GREGORY._,The Sphinx’s tear was somewhat sticky too.
7255,_GREGORY._,Thou didst not spare us; we were put to shame.
7256,_GREGORY._,
7257,_GREGORY._,"_N._ Is that a reason, sir, before this stranger"
7258,_GREGORY._,To mock me? I can appreciate ridicule
7259,_GREGORY._,Prompted by envy at its proper worth.
7260,_GREGORY._,Affecting to find fault with my expressions!
7261,_GREGORY._,"Good morning, gentlemen.      [_Exit._"
7262,_GREGORY._,
7263,_GREGORY._,_R._ You poets treat each other vilely.
7264,_GREGORY._,
7265,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Now, Richard.      1759"
7266,_GREGORY._,
7267,_GREGORY._,_R._ My scheme is this: I have written to my servants;
7268,_GREGORY._,"They will receive you. Leave to-morrow night,"
7269,_GREGORY._,And you will find all ready: You shall have      1761
7270,_GREGORY._,"Such a reception and fair bridal trim,"
7271,_GREGORY._,And high festivities as shall dress out
7272,_GREGORY._,The hasty manner of your coming.
7273,_GREGORY._,
7274,_GREGORY._,"_F._                           But first,"
7275,_GREGORY._,"How shall I make my escape? I am watched, suspected."
7276,_GREGORY._,
7277,_GREGORY._,_R._ I can arrange that too. By my behaviour
7278,_GREGORY._,And letter to the Countess I have contrived
7279,_GREGORY._,To win her trust. First I shall praise her scheme
7280,_GREGORY._,"Of sending you to Milan, and then persuade her"
7281,_GREGORY._,To send you again. You must hit on a plan      1771
7282,_GREGORY._,"How to convey your lady to the carriage,"
7283,_GREGORY._,And all is done.
7284,_GREGORY._,
7285,_GREGORY._,_F._           What shall I do with Tristram?
7286,_GREGORY._,
7287,_GREGORY._,_R._ Leave him to me: my purse will settle him.
7288,_GREGORY._,
7289,_GREGORY._,_F._ ’Tis excellently schemed; but if Diana
7290,_GREGORY._,"Press me to tell how I obtained the letter,"
7291,_GREGORY._,What can I say?
7292,_GREGORY._,
7293,_GREGORY._,_R._          She is easily put off:
7294,_GREGORY._,That question does not touch her. Any tale
7295,_GREGORY._,Will serve.
7296,_GREGORY._,
7297,_GREGORY._,"_F._      Yet, Richard, what so generously"
7298,_GREGORY._,You do for me must ruin you with her.      1780
7299,_GREGORY._,Is’t possible you are cured!
7300,_GREGORY._,
7301,_GREGORY._,"_R._                       No, no: mistake not!"
7302,_GREGORY._,I am more and more in love: and see my way
7303,_GREGORY._,By certain steps: and first to get thee married.
7304,_GREGORY._,"Her love for thee is a romance, which I"
7305,_GREGORY._,Can shift upon myself when thou art gone.
7306,_GREGORY._,"And that she loves thee, thee the worthiest,"
7307,_GREGORY._,"Dearest and nearest of my earliest friends,"
7308,_GREGORY._,Is no impediment. Is’t not half way
7309,_GREGORY._,"To loving me? ’Tis happy for me, Frederick,"
7310,_GREGORY._,Thou hast not seen her worth.
7311,_GREGORY._,
7312,_GREGORY._,_F._                        And I half question      1790
7313,_GREGORY._,Whether ’tis not my duty as friend of both
7314,_GREGORY._,To close with her and save you.
7315,_GREGORY._,
7316,_GREGORY._,"_R._                          Thou dost not know her,"
7317,_GREGORY._,"Because, I thank thee for it, thou dost not love her."
7318,_GREGORY._,"And, friend, thy speech is gross; why the truth is"
7319,_GREGORY._,"There’s not a man or woman on God’s earth,"
7320,_GREGORY._,"However humble, mean, or ill-appearing,"
7321,_GREGORY._,"That hath not in his sight some grace and favour,"
7322,_GREGORY._,"Which angels see: but mortals overlook it,"
7323,_GREGORY._,Being spiritually blind: for which affliction
7324,_GREGORY._,"They have suffered half their shames, and slain the just."
7325,_GREGORY._,"But Love, God’s gift, is spiritual sight;      1801"
7326,_GREGORY._,"’Tis the perception, which man lacks of all,"
7327,_GREGORY._,"Given him of one, to see as angels see."
7328,_GREGORY._,This is man’s marriage: and what now I love
7329,_GREGORY._,"Is not, friend, what thou seest,—though thou mayst see"
7330,_GREGORY._,"A beauty unparallel’d,—but rather that"
7331,_GREGORY._,Which by love’s gift I see: so say no more.
7332,_GREGORY._,
7333,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Forgive me, Richard: ’tis a just rebuke."
7334,_GREGORY._,I did speak grossly. ’Tis that artist’s pride
7335,_GREGORY._,Of which you used to warn me: I will confess it.
7336,_GREGORY._,In my own case I am idealist      1811
7337,_GREGORY._,At the price of all the world. If I believed
7338,_GREGORY._,"I were as others, I should mock myself."
7339,_GREGORY._,"I have not yet come to that. Now, in my excuse,"
7340,_GREGORY._,Diana is sometimes laughable.
7341,_GREGORY._,
7342,_GREGORY._,_R._                        And who
7343,_GREGORY._,"Would not be laughable who had his way,"
7344,_GREGORY._,Or if one set his humours on a throne?
7345,_GREGORY._,
7346,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Well, you will rule her. Still there’s room to fear"
7347,_GREGORY._,You may not win her.
7348,_GREGORY._,
7349,_GREGORY._,_R._               I doubt not to win:
7350,_GREGORY._,At least if you’ll be gone.
7351,_GREGORY._,
7352,_GREGORY._,_F._                      Trust me to go.      1820
7353,_GREGORY._,
7354,_GREGORY._,_Re-enter Diana with papers in hand. Laura and Flora._
7355,_GREGORY._,
7356,_GREGORY._,_D._ Frederick!
7357,_GREGORY._,
7358,_GREGORY._,_F._          Your ladyship!
7359,_GREGORY._,
7360,_GREGORY._,_D._                       This settlement
7361,_GREGORY._,Is but waste paper. Didst thou draw it thyself?
7362,_GREGORY._,
7363,_GREGORY._,"_F._ I did, your ladyship."
7364,_GREGORY._,
7365,_GREGORY._,_D._                     Then pray explain.
7366,_GREGORY._,
7367,_GREGORY._,_F._ If I have made any error....
7368,_GREGORY._,
7369,_GREGORY._,"_D._                            Error, sir!"
7370,_GREGORY._,The lady is here left wholly unprovided.
7371,_GREGORY._,And if Sir Gregory had not by good fortune
7372,_GREGORY._,"Studied the terms, but trusted to thy skill,"
7373,_GREGORY._,He had left his daughter penniless.
7374,_GREGORY._,
7375,_GREGORY._,_F._                              There is full time
7376,_GREGORY._,To draw it afresh. I humbly crave your pardon
7377,_GREGORY._,For my mistake.
7378,_GREGORY._,
7379,_GREGORY._,"_D._          Stay, I have more against thee.      1830"
7380,_GREGORY._,I will proceed in form. We have an audience:
7381,_GREGORY._,"Stand upon thy defence. I am the plaintiff,"
7382,_GREGORY._,"The accuser; and, Ricardo, be thou judge."
7383,_GREGORY._,Hear all. This gentleman hath been my secretary
7384,_GREGORY._,Now for twelve months. In all my affairs I have set
7385,_GREGORY._,No limit to my trust: I have ever shewn him
7386,_GREGORY._,Absolute confidence: and yet how think you
7387,_GREGORY._,Hath he repaid me? He hath lied to me.
7388,_GREGORY._,I accuse him here to his face before you all.
7389,_GREGORY._,He said to-day he had been last night to Milan      1840
7390,_GREGORY._,"And brought me a letter, when he had never been there,"
7391,_GREGORY._,"And had not brought it. Contradict me, sir,"
7392,_GREGORY._,If I say wrong. You hear he is silent. Now
7393,_GREGORY._,I say he forged that letter.
7394,_GREGORY._,
7395,_GREGORY._,"_F._                       Silence, my lady,"
7396,_GREGORY._,Is the answer fittest for a charge too gross
7397,_GREGORY._,To be denied.
7398,_GREGORY._,
7399,_GREGORY._,_D._        Then tell me by what means
7400,_GREGORY._,The letter came to thee. Still silent. I hope
7401,_GREGORY._,"Thou dost mark that, Ricardo."
7402,_GREGORY._,
7403,_GREGORY._,_F._                        In my defence
7404,_GREGORY._,I say I have served your ladyship as well
7405,_GREGORY._,"As you have trusted me: and for this matter,—"
7406,_GREGORY._,You gave me a letter for the Duke of Milan      1851
7407,_GREGORY._,Requiring speedy answer. I procured
7408,_GREGORY._,That answer in good time.
7409,_GREGORY._,
7410,_GREGORY._,"_D._                    Ah, but thou saidst"
7411,_GREGORY._,"That thou thyself didst bear it, as I bade thee."
7412,_GREGORY._,Silent? Now here’s a secret; there’s some matter
7413,_GREGORY._,Withheld from me which I have a right to know.
7414,_GREGORY._,I have cause to think thou hast upon thy person
7415,_GREGORY._,The explanation. I would see what papers
7416,_GREGORY._,Thou carriest with thee.
7417,_GREGORY._,
7418,_GREGORY._,"_F._                   I have no papers, madam,"
7419,_GREGORY._,Such as you look to find.
7420,_GREGORY._,
7421,_GREGORY._,_D._                    Thou sayst that letter      1860
7422,_GREGORY._,Was not a forgery. I wish to see
7423,_GREGORY._,If something which I think is in thy pocket
7424,_GREGORY._,Is not a forgery.
7425,_GREGORY._,
7426,_GREGORY._,_F._            If on first appearance
7427,_GREGORY._,"Of having wronged you, you mistrust me thus,"
7428,_GREGORY._,There is no cure. Demand my papers from me:
7429,_GREGORY._,I cannot take them back.
7430,_GREGORY._,
7431,_GREGORY._,_D._                   I do demand them.
7432,_GREGORY._,
7433,_GREGORY._,_F._ You shall have everything in perfect order
7434,_GREGORY._,Before this evening.
7435,_GREGORY._,
7436,_GREGORY._,_D._               Stay! I wish to see
7437,_GREGORY._,What papers thou hast with thee.
7438,_GREGORY._,
7439,_GREGORY._,_F._                           Very well.
7440,_GREGORY._,This is the only pocket in my dress;      1870
7441,_GREGORY._,Here the contents. (_Offers a few letters._)
7442,_GREGORY._,
7443,_GREGORY._,_D._             Is that the only pocket?
7444,_GREGORY._,I thought there was another little pocket
7445,_GREGORY._,On the left side.
7446,_GREGORY._,
7447,_GREGORY._,_F._ (_aside_). Ah! ’tis that villain Tristram
7448,_GREGORY._,Hath told her this.
7449,_GREGORY._,
7450,_GREGORY._,"_D._              What say you, sir? Is’t true?"
7451,_GREGORY._,No answer. Now I think the explanation
7452,_GREGORY._,"Lies in that pocket. If I am wrong, ’tis easy"
7453,_GREGORY._,To prove me so. But if thou hast a secret....
7454,_GREGORY._,
7455,_GREGORY._,"_F._ I have a secret, and you are well informed"
7456,_GREGORY._,I carry it on me. And to prove to all
7457,_GREGORY._,"’Tis of a private nature, I will shew it.      1880"
7458,_GREGORY._,’Tis but this little case. (_Shews case of portrait._)
7459,_GREGORY._,
7460,_GREGORY._,_D._                     A portrait-case?
7461,_GREGORY._,
7462,_GREGORY._,_F._ A portrait.
7463,_GREGORY._,
7464,_GREGORY._,"_D._           Ah, then, now we have the truth:"
7465,_GREGORY._,Thou art in love. This is the wondrous sickness
7466,_GREGORY._,That keeps thee at home when I would send thee forth:
7467,_GREGORY._,Distracted thee in drawing of the deed....
7468,_GREGORY._,
7469,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Enough, my lady; you have pushed this far enough."
7470,_GREGORY._,
7471,_GREGORY._,_D._ Oh no! I have now another charge of falsehood.
7472,_GREGORY._,I have long suspected this; and yesterday
7473,_GREGORY._,"When I did ask thee if thou wert in love,"
7474,_GREGORY._,Thou didst deny it. But thou dost not now—      1890
7475,_GREGORY._,So tell me who the lady is.
7476,_GREGORY._,
7477,_GREGORY._,_L._ (_aside to R._). All’s lost!
7478,_GREGORY._,
7479,_GREGORY._,_F._ (_coming quite to front_). Your ladyship must grant
7480,_GREGORY._,me in private conduct
7481,_GREGORY._,Some liberty: my honest duty and service
7482,_GREGORY._,"Never surrendered that, and should avail"
7483,_GREGORY._,To spare me this ungenerous inquisition.
7484,_GREGORY._,
7485,_GREGORY._,"_D._ And very well, sir, if thou hast not transgressed"
7486,_GREGORY._,The rules of the court: these art thou bound to observe:
7487,_GREGORY._,"And these, as well thou knowest, forbid my ladies"
7488,_GREGORY._,"To hide their love affairs from me. Dark meetings,"
7489,_GREGORY._,"Intrigue, sly correspondence, and the rest,      1900"
7490,_GREGORY._,"Are treason here; nay, they are so well forbidden,"
7491,_GREGORY._,That to conceal them is a breach of trust.
7492,_GREGORY._,"Give me thy word then, Frederick, that this portrait"
7493,_GREGORY._,"Is not of any lady in my court,"
7494,_GREGORY._,"I’ll ask no more.—But if she is of the court,"
7495,_GREGORY._,"I’ll know who it is. Now speak, and quit thyself."
7496,_GREGORY._,
7497,_GREGORY._,_F._ I will not say whether it is so or no.
7498,_GREGORY._,
7499,_GREGORY._,_D._ That is confession. I must see the portrait.
7500,_GREGORY._,"Ricardo, now thy judgment."
7501,_GREGORY._,
7502,_GREGORY._,"_R._                     I fear, my lady,"
7503,_GREGORY._,I have too short acquaintance with the rules      1910
7504,_GREGORY._,Appealed to; and if I offer you my judgment
7505,_GREGORY._,By such unwritten statutes as obtain
7506,_GREGORY._,"In the best circles that I know, for instance,"
7507,_GREGORY._,The court of Milan....
7508,_GREGORY._,
7509,_GREGORY._,_D._                 What is the court of Milan?
7510,_GREGORY._,"Are we not here at Belflor?—You know the rules,"
7511,_GREGORY._,Laura; speak for me.
7512,_GREGORY._,
7513,_GREGORY._,_L._               He must shew the portrait.
7514,_GREGORY._,
7515,_GREGORY._,(_Coming forward to F._)
7516,_GREGORY._,
7517,_GREGORY._,(_Aside._) All’s lost unless I do it.
7518,_GREGORY._,"(_To F._)                           Sir, give it to me."
7519,_GREGORY._,Judgment hath gone against you. I can promise
7520,_GREGORY._,No eye shall learn thy secret but the Countess.
7521,_GREGORY._,To her ’tis due. So give her up the portrait.      1920
7522,_GREGORY._,(_Aside to F._) I will exchange them.—
7523,_GREGORY._,
7524,_GREGORY._,_F. gives L. the portrait: which the spectators see her exchange for
7525,_GREGORY._,"another. She turns, and, going to D., presents her with that._"
7526,_GREGORY._,
7527,_GREGORY._,"_D._ (_taking_). I thank thee, Laura; and now to learn the secret:"
7528,_GREGORY._,Who is this wanton traitress? (_Opens case._)
7529,_GREGORY._,Ah!—ha! ha!
7530,_GREGORY._,"Impossible,—’tis true. Who would believe it?"
7531,_GREGORY._,"Why, friends, there is no secret after all:"
7532,_GREGORY._,"No lady,—’tis himself.—"
7533,_GREGORY._,He carries a portrait of himself; himself
7534,_GREGORY._,"Leaning upon his elbow. Now, heaven save me!"
7535,_GREGORY._,"This I was told; but tho’my own eyes see it,"
7536,_GREGORY._,"I cannot credit it. O, gracious sir,      1930"
7537,_GREGORY._,"I have wronged thee, and beg pardon. Yet, I think,"
7538,_GREGORY._,"Thou losest in acquittal. O Frederick, Frederick!"
7539,_GREGORY._,"Although thou art a poet, and mayst think"
7540,_GREGORY._,"Thou hast a touch of rarer stuff, to make thee"
7541,_GREGORY._,"Self-centred;—nay, tho’thou wert more than that,"
7542,_GREGORY._,More than I ever thought thee....
7543,_GREGORY._,To carry thine own portrait! to have a pocket
7544,_GREGORY._,"For it! well, well! ’tis a fair picture enough,"
7545,_GREGORY._,Not undeserving of its jewelled case.
7546,_GREGORY._,Poor little image! now I’m sorry for thee;      1940
7547,_GREGORY._,"Thou hast no lady-lover, but must live"
7548,_GREGORY._,"In thine own pocket, as it were.—Let me have thee,"
7549,_GREGORY._,"I’ll keep thee—may I not, Frederick?—a remembrance"
7550,_GREGORY._,"Of better hopes. Come, Laura: doth your poet"
7551,_GREGORY._,"Carry his portrait, too? He is distanced quite."
7552,_GREGORY._,
7553,_GREGORY._,[_Exit D. and L. with Flora._
7554,_GREGORY._,
7555,_GREGORY._,"_F._ By heaven, well saved!"
7556,_GREGORY._,
7557,_GREGORY._,_R._                      What is’t? I understand not.
7558,_GREGORY._,’Twas your own portrait?
7559,_GREGORY._,
7560,_GREGORY._,_F._                   Yes; but that I had
7561,_GREGORY._,"Was Laura’s. She having mine, stepped in between,"
7562,_GREGORY._,And interchanged them.
7563,_GREGORY._,
7564,_GREGORY._,_R._ I never saw it. Bravo!—most deftly done.
7565,_GREGORY._,
7566,_GREGORY._,"_F._ ’Twas touch and go. That meddling devil, Tristram,      1951"
7567,_GREGORY._,He must have told her of it.
7568,_GREGORY._,
7569,_GREGORY._,_Re-enter Laura._
7570,_GREGORY._,
7571,_GREGORY._,"_L._                       The Countess, Frederick,"
7572,_GREGORY._,Bids me return the portrait. You may die
7573,_GREGORY._,"To look on it, she says,—here ’tis. (_Giving her own._)"
7574,_GREGORY._,
7575,_GREGORY._,_F._                               Be sure
7576,_GREGORY._,This is the right one. Well: she says not ill. (_Kissing it._)
7577,_GREGORY._,
7578,_GREGORY._,_L._ I tremble still.
7579,_GREGORY._,
7580,_GREGORY._,"_F._                O, you did well."
7581,_GREGORY._,
7582,_GREGORY._,_L._                               To-night
7583,_GREGORY._,Be in the park again—under my window—
7584,_GREGORY._,I am set to watch for you.
7585,_GREGORY._,
7586,_GREGORY._,_F._                     You!
7587,_GREGORY._,
7588,_GREGORY._,"_L._                        Yes,—by Diana."
7589,_GREGORY._,"Eleven,—I dare not stay. Farewell till then.      [_Exit._"
7590,_GREGORY._,
7591,_GREGORY._,"_F._ Well, there’s the end of it, Richard.      1960"
7592,_GREGORY._,
7593,_GREGORY._,_R._                              Yes: and ’tis plain
7594,_GREGORY._,"She never really loved you. Yet, if I am right,"
7595,_GREGORY._,"Here’s a new difficulty arisen. Diana,"
7596,_GREGORY._,"If she believes this nonsense, will no longer"
7597,_GREGORY._,Be jealous for you; and I shall never manage
7598,_GREGORY._,To get you off to Milan.
7599,_GREGORY._,
7600,_GREGORY._,_F._                     ’Tis worse than ever.
7601,_GREGORY._,What can we do?
7602,_GREGORY._,
7603,_GREGORY._,"_R._            ’Tis best I undeceive her,"
7604,_GREGORY._,And set things as they were. Her jealousy
7605,_GREGORY._,Is ground to work on; but this foolery
7606,_GREGORY._,Is bottomless.
7607,_GREGORY._,
7608,_GREGORY._,_Re-enter Flora._
7609,_GREGORY._,
7610,_GREGORY._,_Fl._ (_to R._). Her ladyship has sent
7611,_GREGORY._,"To beg you await her, sir. She hath a matter"
7612,_GREGORY._,To speak of with you in private.
7613,_GREGORY._,
7614,_GREGORY._,_R._                           Bear my respects      1970
7615,_GREGORY._,Back to your mistress;—say I await her here.
7616,_GREGORY._,
7617,_GREGORY._,[_Exit Flora._
7618,_GREGORY._,
7619,_GREGORY._,"See how I prosper. Get you gone, while I"
7620,_GREGORY._,Step in your shoes.
7621,_GREGORY._,
7622,_GREGORY._,"_F._              Richard, do not be rash:"
7623,_GREGORY._,"And if you find she is cured, leave well alone."
7624,_GREGORY._,
7625,_GREGORY._,_R._ Trust me: in serving you I serve myself.
7626,_GREGORY._,
7627,_GREGORY._,[_Exit F._
7628,_GREGORY._,
7629,_GREGORY._,Diana hath not been honestly in love.
7630,_GREGORY._,If ’twere the virtual Frederick she adored
7631,_GREGORY._,"She could not so mistake him. ’Tis but fancy,"
7632,_GREGORY._,Which jealousy hath magnified to passion:
7633,_GREGORY._,"And now she eyes him as the fox the grapes,      1980"
7634,_GREGORY._,"And rather than be crossed, she’ll be persuaded"
7635,_GREGORY._,"That he’s an idiot. That’s not honest love,—"
7636,_GREGORY._,Fanciful consolations are the comfort
7637,_GREGORY._,"Of fancied passion,—love needs better food."
7638,_GREGORY._,
7639,_GREGORY._,_Re-enter Diana._
7640,_GREGORY._,
7641,_GREGORY._,"_D._ How now, Ricardo? I have not done laughing yet."
7642,_GREGORY._,What of my ingenious secretary? I think
7643,_GREGORY._,’Tis well I trapped him: we might else have searched
7644,_GREGORY._,For a lady long enough.
7645,_GREGORY._,
7646,_GREGORY._,_R._                  You are satisfied
7647,_GREGORY._,By this discovery?
7648,_GREGORY._,
7649,_GREGORY._,_D._             Clearly; all is explained.
7650,_GREGORY._,I came to tell you the campaign is over.      1990
7651,_GREGORY._,"Finding there’s nought to seek, the search is ended."
7652,_GREGORY._,"The wonder is, Tristram had solved the mystery,"
7653,_GREGORY._,And told me; but I laughed.
7654,_GREGORY._,
7655,_GREGORY._,_R._                      Now you believe?
7656,_GREGORY._,
7657,_GREGORY._,_D._ Ha! ha!
7658,_GREGORY._,
7659,_GREGORY._,_R._       How you must now despise him!
7660,_GREGORY._,
7661,_GREGORY._,"_D._                                   I do, indeed."
7662,_GREGORY._,
7663,_GREGORY._,_R._ You laugh. ’Tis strange that it should please you.
7664,_GREGORY._,
7665,_GREGORY._,_D._ Ah!
7666,_GREGORY._,I laugh to think there was no cause for all
7667,_GREGORY._,My....
7668,_GREGORY._,
7669,_GREGORY._,_R._   Your....
7670,_GREGORY._,
7671,_GREGORY._,"_D._          My needless trouble, my anxiety."
7672,_GREGORY._,
7673,_GREGORY._,"_R._ Anxiety,—you mean, lest?..."
7674,_GREGORY._,
7675,_GREGORY._,_D._                            For my maids.
7676,_GREGORY._,
7677,_GREGORY._,_R._ (_half-aside_). Indeed!—indeed!
7678,_GREGORY._,
7679,_GREGORY._,_D._                                ’Twas more than laughable
7680,_GREGORY._,To see him; and you there with your face so grave.
7681,_GREGORY._,
7682,_GREGORY._,_R._ I thought you were deceived.      2001
7683,_GREGORY._,
7684,_GREGORY._,"_D._                            I was deceived,"
7685,_GREGORY._,But now I understand.
7686,_GREGORY._,
7687,_GREGORY._,"_R._                Your ladyship,"
7688,_GREGORY._,"I think, is more mistaken now than ever."
7689,_GREGORY._,Frederick hath told me himself that he is in love;
7690,_GREGORY._,"And that’s the truth, both likely, and well-confirmed,"
7691,_GREGORY._,Even by the accident you set against it.
7692,_GREGORY._,You find on him a portrait of himself
7693,_GREGORY._,Set in a jewelled case; just such a gift
7694,_GREGORY._,"As he might make to his lady. I know, from him,"
7695,_GREGORY._,He hath her picture.
7696,_GREGORY._,
7697,_GREGORY._,_D._               Ah! you have seen it?
7698,_GREGORY._,
7699,_GREGORY._,_R._                                   No.      2010
7700,_GREGORY._,
7701,_GREGORY._,_D._ Then I am assured there is no other picture
7702,_GREGORY._,Than that I saw. His servant guessed the truth:
7703,_GREGORY._,"’Twas part of a pretence, for which I think"
7704,_GREGORY._,There may be a cause. There is no lady at all.
7705,_GREGORY._,
7706,_GREGORY._,_R._ Tristram’s a fool; and wrests what wit he hath
7707,_GREGORY._,To outwit himself.
7708,_GREGORY._,
7709,_GREGORY._,_D._             What then do you believe?
7710,_GREGORY._,
7711,_GREGORY._,_R._ I see the stroke your ladyship prepared
7712,_GREGORY._,Was excellent: the merest chance in the world
7713,_GREGORY._,Enabled him to escape.
7714,_GREGORY._,
7715,_GREGORY._,_D._                 Impossible.
7716,_GREGORY._,"This is a dream. Besides, how could he dare      2020"
7717,_GREGORY._,"Deceive me again, and wish me to believe"
7718,_GREGORY._,That he is a fool?
7719,_GREGORY._,
7720,_GREGORY._,_R._             A false opinion wrongs
7721,_GREGORY._,The holder most.
7722,_GREGORY._,
7723,_GREGORY._,_D._           Never! I cannot think it.
7724,_GREGORY._,
7725,_GREGORY._,_R._ You do not wish to think it.
7726,_GREGORY._,
7727,_GREGORY._,"_D._                            And what dost thou, sir,"
7728,_GREGORY._,Think that I wish?
7729,_GREGORY._,
7730,_GREGORY._,_R._             One thing at least is clear....
7731,_GREGORY._,
7732,_GREGORY._,_D._ (_aside_). Good heaven! if I have betrayed myself—
7733,_GREGORY._,"Well, sir!"
7734,_GREGORY._,
7735,_GREGORY._,_R._ You are vexed to think Frederick should be in love.
7736,_GREGORY._,
7737,_GREGORY._,"_D._ How so, pray?—how should I be vexed at that?"
7738,_GREGORY._,
7739,_GREGORY._,_R._ The fear to lose so good a secretary.      2030
7740,_GREGORY._,
7741,_GREGORY._,"_D._ So good a secretary!—Ha! now, Ricardo,"
7742,_GREGORY._,"I am vexed, that’s the truth, at Frederick’s love.—"
7743,_GREGORY._,I see how likely it is you are right—I am sorry—
7744,_GREGORY._,I do not wish to believe it: I thought at first
7745,_GREGORY._,"His lady, whoever she was, might be in the town:"
7746,_GREGORY._,"Or, if the affair had sprung within my court,"
7747,_GREGORY._,It might be one of my guests: but now it happens
7748,_GREGORY._,We have no visitors. If last night he kept
7749,_GREGORY._,"An appointment here in the court,—who can it be"
7750,_GREGORY._,But one of the maids? Are you surprised I am vexed?
7751,_GREGORY._,"I thought well of him, and still would think the best:"
7752,_GREGORY._,I’ll not believe it.
7753,_GREGORY._,
7754,_GREGORY._,_R._ (_aside_).    I shall not act this out.      2041
7755,_GREGORY._,I almost dare to tell her all: she tortures
7756,_GREGORY._,Herself for nothing.—I cannot....
7757,_GREGORY._,
7758,_GREGORY._,"_D._                             What say you, sir?"
7759,_GREGORY._,
7760,_GREGORY._,"_R._ ’Tis out of the question, madam."
7761,_GREGORY._,
7762,_GREGORY._,"_D._                                Nay, tell not me."
7763,_GREGORY._,I know what men will do.
7764,_GREGORY._,
7765,_GREGORY._,"_R._                   If you believe it,"
7766,_GREGORY._,There’s but one plan.
7767,_GREGORY._,
7768,_GREGORY._,_D._                And that?
7769,_GREGORY._,
7770,_GREGORY._,_R._                        To send him away.
7771,_GREGORY._,
7772,_GREGORY._,_D._ To send him away? Of course I might; I’ll do it:
7773,_GREGORY._,"To-night, Ricardo."
7774,_GREGORY._,
7775,_GREGORY._,_R._ (_aside_).    Now we go too fast—      2049
7776,_GREGORY._,The sooner he goes the better: and yet your plan
7777,_GREGORY._,"Was good, to watch to-night. Now that he thinks"
7778,_GREGORY._,"Suspicion lulled too, he will be more rash."
7779,_GREGORY._,"Let Lady Laura watch the garden, and I"
7780,_GREGORY._,"His room: even if that fail, ’tis time enough"
7781,_GREGORY._,To send him off to-morrow.
7782,_GREGORY._,
7783,_GREGORY._,"_D._ ... I thought when I came in here, Ricardo,"
7784,_GREGORY._,I had come to the end of the matter: I find instead
7785,_GREGORY._,"’Tis ten times more involved, doubtful, and difficult."
7786,_GREGORY._,"For after this exposure, if Frederick stayed,"
7787,_GREGORY._,"Our mutual trust is sapped: and if, as you urge,"
7788,_GREGORY._,"I send him away, there’s none to take his place.      2060"
7789,_GREGORY._,Nor can I do without him. In two days hence
7790,_GREGORY._,"The wedding is fixed, for which a host of guests"
7791,_GREGORY._,Are bid to the house. Sir Gregory being so deaf
7792,_GREGORY._,Would be overwhelmed: Frederick cannot be spared.
7793,_GREGORY._,Yet would he stay if I asked him? Did you hear him
7794,_GREGORY._,Threaten he would not take his papers back?
7795,_GREGORY._,"He sees, no doubt, how necessary he is."
7796,_GREGORY._,
7797,_GREGORY._,"_R._ No doubt, my lady, he sees that when he is gone"
7798,_GREGORY._,He cannot be here to help you.
7799,_GREGORY._,
7800,_GREGORY._,_D._                         Who can help me?
7801,_GREGORY._,What is your counsel?
7802,_GREGORY._,
7803,_GREGORY._,_R._                Not to ask a favour      2070
7804,_GREGORY._,Of one whom you so hotly have charged with wrong.
7805,_GREGORY._,
7806,_GREGORY._,_D._ I would not.
7807,_GREGORY._,
7808,_GREGORY._,_R._            Sir Gregory then must do his best.
7809,_GREGORY._,
7810,_GREGORY._,_D._ ’Tis no solution that.
7811,_GREGORY._,
7812,_GREGORY._,"_R._                      Then what, my lady,"
7813,_GREGORY._,If I should take the place awhile? I offer
7814,_GREGORY._,"My service, I would do my best."
7815,_GREGORY._,
7816,_GREGORY._,"_D._                          I thank you,"
7817,_GREGORY._,Ricardo. I hardly like to accept; and yet
7818,_GREGORY._,You have come to know much that I could not tell
7819,_GREGORY._,To another.
7820,_GREGORY._,
7821,_GREGORY._,_R._ (_aside_). I win. But she must ask me herself.
7822,_GREGORY._,
7823,_GREGORY._,_D._ I think I might accept.—What say you?
7824,_GREGORY._,
7825,_GREGORY._,"_R._                                      My lady,"
7826,_GREGORY._,"I see one difficulty,—I have offered more      2080"
7827,_GREGORY._,Than is quite my own: for being the Duke’s servant
7828,_GREGORY._,I cannot without his leave give pledge to another.
7829,_GREGORY._,
7830,_GREGORY._,_D._ Cannot you get his leave?
7831,_GREGORY._,
7832,_GREGORY._,_R._                         Yes. I will ask it.
7833,_GREGORY._,And what if Frederick be our messenger?
7834,_GREGORY._,Send him again to Milan; the very mission
7835,_GREGORY._,That he played false in: so your dignity
7836,_GREGORY._,Is salved and explanation saved.
7837,_GREGORY._,
7838,_GREGORY._,_D._                           ’Tis good.
7839,_GREGORY._,To-morrow he goes. If you will act in his place—
7840,_GREGORY._,"For some ten days, say?"
7841,_GREGORY._,
7842,_GREGORY._,"_R._                  Longer, if it should please you."
7843,_GREGORY._,
7844,_GREGORY._,"_D._ I thank you, I shall not need it.      2090"
7845,_GREGORY._,
7846,_GREGORY._,_R._                                 But if....
7847,_GREGORY._,
7848,_GREGORY._,_D._                                            If what?
7849,_GREGORY._,
7850,_GREGORY._,"_R._ If Frederick should resign, and if the Duke"
7851,_GREGORY._,"Gave me permission, might I keep my place?"
7852,_GREGORY._,
7853,_GREGORY._,"_D._ I thank you, sir; I hope there’ll be no need."
7854,_GREGORY._,
7855,_GREGORY._,_R._ But may I hope?
7856,_GREGORY._,
7857,_GREGORY._,_D._               In truth I know of none
7858,_GREGORY._,I’d rather see in his place.
7859,_GREGORY._,
7860,_GREGORY._,_R._                       A thousand thanks!
7861,_GREGORY._,
7862,_GREGORY._,"_D._ Why thank me so, sir? I am here the obliged."
7863,_GREGORY._,
7864,_GREGORY._,_R._ Your ladyship knows not the great desire
7865,_GREGORY._,I have felt to serve her.
7866,_GREGORY._,
7867,_GREGORY._,_D._                    I am happy to have inspired it.
7868,_GREGORY._,It comes to me as a sort of consolation
7869,_GREGORY._,In my distress—
7870,_GREGORY._,
7871,_GREGORY._,_R._           Agreed then that to-night      2100
7872,_GREGORY._,"We watch. If nothing come of that, to-morrow"
7873,_GREGORY._,Frederick is sent to Milan with my letter.
7874,_GREGORY._,Only your ladyship must be prepared
7875,_GREGORY._,"To lose him. Whoever it is he loves, I am sure"
7876,_GREGORY._,"When we discover her, we shall find a passion"
7877,_GREGORY._,"Worthy and deep, from which he’ll not be moved:"
7878,_GREGORY._,Therefore....
7879,_GREGORY._,
7880,_GREGORY._,"_D._ O, you are mistaken. I know him better."
7881,_GREGORY._,"I know he is cold. Well, well: I thank you. I wish you"
7882,_GREGORY._,"Good-evening, sir.—To-morrow speak we of this—"
7883,_GREGORY._,"But I have been much deceived.—Be not concerned,"
7884,_GREGORY._,’Tis nothing.      [_Faints._
7885,_GREGORY._,
7886,_GREGORY._,_R._ (_supporting her to a chair_). Flora!—Here is a
7887,_GREGORY._,"chair, my lady,                              2111"
7888,_GREGORY._,"You are over-wrought. (_Aside._) By heaven, what"
7889,_GREGORY._,brutes we are!
7890,_GREGORY._,’Twere kinder far to tell her at once—Diana!
7891,_GREGORY._,Dearest Diana! (_Aside._) What am I doing?—Flora! Flora!
7892,_GREGORY._,
7893,_GREGORY._,_Re-enter Flora._
7894,_GREGORY._,
7895,_GREGORY._,_Fl._ My lady in one of her fits!
7896,_GREGORY._,
7897,_GREGORY._,"_R._ What is it? Look at her, Flora!"
7898,_GREGORY._,
7899,_GREGORY._,"_Fl._                              To fan her face,—that’s all."
7900,_GREGORY._,"She will come to herself. See, see!"
7901,_GREGORY._,
7902,_GREGORY._,_R._ (_aside_). This lump 's not fit to touch her.—
7903,_GREGORY._,My lady!—Diana!
7904,_GREGORY._,
7905,_GREGORY._,"_D._ (_awakening_). Who’s there? Ah, Flora!"
7906,_GREGORY._,
7907,_GREGORY._,_Fl._                                     My lady
7908,_GREGORY._,Has fainted again.
7909,_GREGORY._,
7910,_GREGORY._,"_D._             Ricardo!—yes, I remember.      2120"
7911,_GREGORY._,How foolish.
7912,_GREGORY._,
7913,_GREGORY._,"_Fl._      All’s well, my lady."
7914,_GREGORY._,
7915,_GREGORY._,_D._ (_to Fl._).              Give me an arm.
7916,_GREGORY._,I’ll go within.
7917,_GREGORY._,
7918,_GREGORY._,_R._          Cannot I help you?
7919,_GREGORY._,
7920,_GREGORY._,"_D._                           Oh, no."
7921,_GREGORY._,"’Tis nothing,—a silly habit I wish I were rid of."
7922,_GREGORY._,"I thank you. Good evening, sir."
7923,_GREGORY._,
7924,_GREGORY._,"_R._                          Good evening, madam."
7925,_GREGORY._,I promise to bring this all to a happy end.
7926,_GREGORY._,
7927,_GREGORY._,"_D._ I thank you, sir: I would you might. So, Flora."
7928,_GREGORY._,
7929,_GREGORY._,[_Exit with Fl._
7930,_GREGORY._,
7931,_GREGORY._,"_R._ Now, by my soul, Frederick’s atrocious!"
7932,_GREGORY._,’Tis brutal of him. He has let this go too far.
7933,_GREGORY._,She loves him much too well. Good heaven! to think
7934,_GREGORY._,He might have had her. I owe him everything
7935,_GREGORY._,"For being so blind, and eager for his marriage"
7936,_GREGORY._,"With Lady Laura. Yes, and thanks to her      2132"
7937,_GREGORY._,For being so ready; and to St. Nicholas
7938,_GREGORY._,For setting her on: for he in the end appears
7939,_GREGORY._,"As my good genius, tho’he little dreams it."
7940,_GREGORY._,"So far, all prospers—all is in good train."
7941,_GREGORY._,To-morrow will decide my fate.

8054,_ST. NICHOLAS._,I saw him plainly enough. Should I not tell her?—
8055,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8056,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"_D._ Ricardo, go and fetch Sir Gregory;      2171"
8057,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"I have sent St. Nicholas for him, but the man"
8058,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Is scared with terror.
8059,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8060,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"_R._ (_aside_). While all goes well with me, the less I meddle"
8061,_ST. NICHOLAS._,The better. I’ll let her find this out herself.
8062,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8063,_ST. NICHOLAS._,[_Exit_ (L.)
8064,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8065,_ST. NICHOLAS._,_D._ I’ll ring the bell again.
8066,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8067,_ST. NICHOLAS._,_Enter the Maids_ (R.).
8068,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8069,_ST. NICHOLAS._,So here you crawl at last! I had better keep
8070,_ST. NICHOLAS._,No maids at all than such a drowsy troop.
8071,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Not frightened by the fire-bell! You must have
8072,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"Wondrous good consciences. Now, tell me at once—"
8073,_ST. NICHOLAS._,There was a man outside my chamber-door
8074,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Laughing and talking. Answer at once!—who was it?
8075,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Who was it was here?      2181
8076,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
8077,_DOROTHY._,_DOROTHY._
8078,_DOROTHY._,
8079,_DOROTHY._,I heard my lady call;
8080,_DOROTHY._,But did not think that it could be my lady
8081,_DOROTHY._,At such an hour.
8082,_DOROTHY._,
8083,_DOROTHY._,_D._           Nay: I should be asleep
8084,_DOROTHY._,"Of course, but I was not."
8085,_DOROTHY._,
8086,_DOROTHY._,_Enter Gregory and Ricardo_ (L.).
8087,_DOROTHY._,
8088,_DOROTHY._,My major-domo
8089,_DOROTHY._,"At last. Come in, Sir Gregory, come: you are wanted."
8090,_DOROTHY._,
8091,_DOROTHY._,_Sir GREGORY._
8092,_DOROTHY._,
8093,_DOROTHY._,"I am shocked, your ladyship, at what hath happened:"
8094,_DOROTHY._,Ricardo hath told me. But there seems no doubt
8095,_DOROTHY._,The unknown intruder hath escaped. Be sure
8096,_DOROTHY._,"You may retire in safety, without fear"
8097,_DOROTHY._,Of being disturbed again. I will go round      2190
8098,_DOROTHY._,And see that all’s secure. To-morrow morning
8099,_DOROTHY._,There shall be full inquiry.
8100,_DOROTHY._,
8101,_DOROTHY._,"_D._                       To-morrow? Nay,"
8102,_DOROTHY._,I do not leave this spot till I know all.
8103,_DOROTHY._,I guess who ’tis.
8104,_DOROTHY._,
8105,_DOROTHY._,_G._            I pray your ladyship
8106,_DOROTHY._,"Retire. The cold air of the hall, the excitement"
8107,_DOROTHY._,At such an hour may harm your ladyship.
8108,_DOROTHY._,
8109,_DOROTHY._,_D._ No. If I die I’ll learn the truth at once.
8110,_DOROTHY._,I know else how ’twill be. You’ll go to bed
8111,_DOROTHY._,And sleep till noon; and when you wake you’ll say
8112,_DOROTHY._,"’Twas all delusion, that I never heard      2200"
8113,_DOROTHY._,A man at all. That what Ricardo saw
8114,_DOROTHY._,"Was but a bush, a shadow, a bat, an owl"
8115,_DOROTHY._,He frighted from the ivy: and so in the end
8116,_DOROTHY._,All will make light of it.
8117,_DOROTHY._,
8118,_DOROTHY._,_G._                     Heigh! Give me a light.
8119,_DOROTHY._,The lamp has been extinguished on the stairs.
8120,_DOROTHY._,I’ll go and search about.
8121,_DOROTHY._,
8122,_DOROTHY._,"[_Takes a light from one of the maids, and Exit, back._"
8123,_DOROTHY._,
8124,_DOROTHY._,_R._ (_aside_).         I’ll stay and watch.
8125,_DOROTHY._,
8126,_DOROTHY._,"_D._ Now, ye dissemblers, stand forth one by one"
8127,_DOROTHY._,And answer me.
8128,_DOROTHY._,
8129,_DOROTHY._,_R._ (_aside_). This will seal Frederick’s fate.
8130,_DOROTHY._,"She must betray her mean suspicion, and I"
8131,_DOROTHY._,Witness the degradation of her idol.—      2210
8132,_DOROTHY._,
8133,_DOROTHY._,"(_The maids are congregated at back,_ R. _as they come out of the"
8134,_DOROTHY._,"passage. They stand forth singly to be questioned, and come in turn to"
8135,_DOROTHY._,"front_, R.)"
8136,_DOROTHY._,
8137,_DOROTHY._,"_D._ Dorothy first. Dost thou know, Dorothy,"
8138,_DOROTHY._,What man it was whose voice I heard up-stairs;
8139,_DOROTHY._,"Who, when I left my room and gave the alarm,"
8140,_DOROTHY._,Ran out?
8141,_DOROTHY._,
8142,_DOROTHY._,"_Dor._   I do not know, my lady."
8143,_DOROTHY._,
8144,_DOROTHY._,_D._                           I ask
8145,_DOROTHY._,Didst thou not see or hear him?
8146,_DOROTHY._,
8147,_DOROTHY._,"_Dor._                        No, my lady.      2215"
8148,_DOROTHY._,
8149,_DOROTHY._,_D._ Thou wert asleep?
8150,_DOROTHY._,
8151,_DOROTHY._,"_Dor._               I was asleep, my lady."
8152,_DOROTHY._,
8153,_DOROTHY._,"_D._ Then stand aside. Now, Kate."
8154,_DOROTHY._,
8155,_DOROTHY._,_Dor._ (_aside_). Here’s a fine game!
8156,_DOROTHY._,
8157,_DOROTHY._,_D._ Sawst thou or heardst thou anything?
8158,_DOROTHY._,
8159,_KATE._,_KATE._
8160,_KATE._,
8161,_KATE._,"No, my lady."
8162,_KATE._,
8163,_KATE._,_D._ Nothing at all?
8164,_KATE._,
8165,_KATE._,"_K._               Nothing at all, my lady."
8166,_KATE._,
8167,_KATE._,_D._ Wert thou asleep?
8168,_KATE._,
8169,_KATE._,"_K._                 I was asleep, my lady.      2220"
8170,_KATE._,
8171,_KATE._,"_D._ Step thou aside. Now, Flora."
8172,_KATE._,
8173,_KATE._,_K._ (_to Dor._).               Will she lie?
8174,_KATE._,
8175,_KATE._,_Dor._ (_to K._). Trust her.
8176,_KATE._,
8177,_KATE._,"_D._                       Now, Flora, answer."
8178,_KATE._,
8179,_KATE._,_Fl._                                          I am grieved my lady
8180,_KATE._,Should think I could deceive her.
8181,_KATE._,
8182,_KATE._,_D._                            I did not ask
8183,_KATE._,If you deceived me. Heard you any noise?
8184,_KATE._,Did you see any man?
8185,_KATE._,
8186,_KATE._,"_Fl._              Not I, my lady."
8187,_KATE._,
8188,_KATE._,_Dor._ (_aside to K._). Oh! oh!
8189,_KATE._,
8190,_KATE._,_D._ Were you asleep?
8191,_KATE._,
8192,_KATE._,"_Fl._               I was asleep, my lady."
8193,_KATE._,
8194,_KATE._,_D._ Then stand aside.
8195,_KATE._,
8196,_KATE._,_Fl._ (_aside to K._). Did she believe me?
8197,_KATE._,
8198,_KATE._,_K._ (_to Fl._).                         Well!
8199,_KATE._,Thou’st got a brazen face!
8200,_KATE._,
8201,_KATE._,_Dor._ (_do._).          Art thou not shamed?
8202,_KATE._,
8203,_KATE._,_D._ Marcela next. Didst thou hear anything?
8204,_KATE._,
8205,_MARCELA._,_MARCELA._
8206,_MARCELA._,
8207,_MARCELA._,I heard no noise until my lady called.      2231
8208,_MARCELA._,
8209,_MARCELA._,_D._ Thou wert asleep?
8210,_MARCELA._,
8211,_MARCELA._,"_Mar._               I was asleep, my lady."
8212,_MARCELA._,
8213,_MARCELA._,_D._ ’Tis strange. Stand thou aside.
8214,_MARCELA._,
8215,_MARCELA._,_Dor._ (_aside_).                  Now then for Rose.
8216,_MARCELA._,
8217,_MARCELA._,_Mar._ (_do._). She really was asleep.
8218,_MARCELA._,
8219,_MARCELA._,_Fl._ (_do._).                       Then what shall come?
8220,_MARCELA._,
8221,_MARCELA._,"_D._ Now, Rose, thou’rt left alone. Thy fellow-servants"
8222,_MARCELA._,Have all denied the thing of which some one
8223,_MARCELA._,At least is guilty. Thee I did not suspect:
8224,_MARCELA._,But do not fear to tell the truth. Who was it?
8225,_MARCELA._,Tell me who is thy lover. No tittering there!
8226,_MARCELA._,"Your levity makes you all accomplices,"
8227,_MARCELA._,"Ay, every one."
8228,_MARCELA._,
8229,_ROSE._,_ROSE._
8230,_ROSE._,
8231,_ROSE._,"My lady, I have no lover.      2140"
8232,_ROSE._,
8233,_ROSE._,_D._ Tell me who this man was.
8234,_ROSE._,
8235,_ROSE._,_Rose._                      I do not know.
8236,_ROSE._,I heard no noise till Marcela awoke me.
8237,_ROSE._,
8238,_ROSE._,"_D._ Didst thou awake her, Marcela?"
8239,_ROSE._,
8240,_ROSE._,"_Mar._                            Yes, my lady."
8241,_ROSE._,She was asleep. Rose always speaks the truth.
8242,_ROSE._,It wasn’t Rose.
8243,_ROSE._,
8244,_ROSE._,_D._          You are all then in one plot:
8245,_ROSE._,Or shame has made you lie. But never think
8246,_ROSE._,"To escape. I know the gentleman, and know"
8247,_ROSE._,He visits one of you: and which it is
8248,_ROSE._,I’ll learn to-night: unless perhaps you’ll say      2250
8249,_ROSE._,He makes love to you all.
8250,_ROSE._,
8251,_ROSE._,"_Mar._                  Indeed, my lady,"
8252,_ROSE._,He is quite a proper man.
8253,_ROSE._,
8254,_ROSE._,_Dor._                  And all his courtship
8255,_ROSE._,Has been most regular.
8256,_ROSE._,
8257,_ROSE._,"_D._                 Come, come: confess."
8258,_ROSE._,Who is it?
8259,_ROSE._,
8260,_ROSE._,"_Fl._    It’s me, my lady. I must confess."
8261,_ROSE._,
8262,_ROSE._,_D._ Flora!
8263,_ROSE._,
8264,_ROSE._,"_Fl._     Forgive me, I beg; for I abjure"
8265,_ROSE._,"I never asked him: but, as I often tell him,"
8266,_ROSE._,"He takes such liberties; which, as you know him,"
8267,_ROSE._,I need not tell your ladyship: and ’tis true
8268,_ROSE._,We have been some time engaged.
8269,_ROSE._,
8270,_ROSE._,_D._                          Engaged!—to you!
8271,_ROSE._,Here’s a fine story!
8272,_ROSE._,
8273,_ROSE._,_R._ (_aside_).    She has not said his name.      2259
8274,_ROSE._,
8275,_ROSE._,"_Fl._ Indeed, ’tis true, my lady; and I am sure"
8276,_ROSE._,My lady will pardon me. And since he hath told me
8277,_ROSE._,How kind your ladyship hath been to him....
8278,_ROSE._,
8279,_ROSE._,"_D._ By heaven, I’ll have you whipped,—whipped!"
8280,_ROSE._,
8281,_ROSE._,"_Fl._                                          O, my lady!"
8282,_ROSE._,
8283,_ROSE._,"_D._ And speak of marriage, you impertinent hussy!"
8284,_ROSE._,
8285,_ROSE._,"_Fl._ It was the money which your ladyship gave him,"
8286,_ROSE._,That made us think of marrying.
8287,_ROSE._,
8288,_ROSE._,_D._                          Worse and worse!
8289,_ROSE._,To spend my present on my waiting-maid.—
8290,_ROSE._,O thy pretension! thy pretension! Think you
8291,_ROSE._,He really loves you?
8292,_ROSE._,
8293,_ROSE._,_Fl._              Why not?
8294,_ROSE._,
8295,_ROSE._,"_Maids._                  Ay, why not?      2270"
8296,_ROSE._,
8297,_ROSE._,_D._ What hath he ever said to make you think
8298,_ROSE._,"He loves you, Flora?"
8299,_ROSE._,
8300,_ROSE._,"_Fl._              He told me very often,"
8301,_ROSE._,Before I’d have him....
8302,_ROSE._,
8303,_ROSE._,_D._                  Ah!
8304,_ROSE._,
8305,_ROSE._,_Kate._                 And that I warrant.
8306,_ROSE._,"He’s not one of your struck-dumb mumbling sort,"
8307,_ROSE._,That haven’t a word.
8308,_ROSE._,
8309,_ROSE._,"_D._               Silence! And tell me, Flora,"
8310,_ROSE._,Something he has said.
8311,_ROSE._,
8312,_ROSE._,"_Fl._ He calls me his little love,—his duck:      2275"
8313,_ROSE._,And says a hundred thousand pretty things
8314,_ROSE._,As often as we meet.
8315,_ROSE._,
8316,_ROSE._,_D._               A hundred thousand!
8317,_ROSE._,"His compliments are cheap. Duck, too!"
8318,_ROSE._,
8319,_ROSE._,"_Fl._                               My lady,"
8320,_ROSE._,’Tis what men say. It does not mean a duck.
8321,_ROSE._,
8322,_ROSE._,"_Kate._ ’Tis true, my lady; ’tis a common saying."
8323,_ROSE._,
8324,_ROSE._,_D._ Silence! No one of you dare from this moment
8325,_ROSE._,To speak to me. You are all alike disgraced.      2282
8326,_ROSE._,"And, that you are not more shamed, disgraced the more."
8327,_ROSE._,I shall discharge you all.
8328,_ROSE._,
8329,_ROSE._,_Kate._                  What! and Rose too!
8330,_ROSE._,
8331,_ROSE._,"_D._ To-morrow morning. Bút, Flóra, for you"
8332,_ROSE._,I cannot think of punishment sufficient.
8333,_ROSE._,"Merely to have had a lover,—to have concealed it,—"
8334,_ROSE._,"To have even admitted him by night,—were nothing,"
8335,_ROSE._,Had the affair been....
8336,_ROSE._,
8337,_ROSE._,"_Re-enter Sir Gregory up the stairs with Tristram’s hat,"
8338,_ROSE._,holding it up._
8339,_ROSE._,
8340,_ROSE._,"_G._ Found on the stairs,—the intruder’s hat, my lady:      2290"
8341,_ROSE._,"He had thrown it on the lamp to extinguish it,"
8342,_ROSE._,And thereby is detected.
8343,_ROSE._,
8344,_ROSE._,_R._ (_aside_).        Now’s revelation.
8345,_ROSE._,
8346,_ROSE._,"_D._ Why,—but whose hat is this?"
8347,_ROSE._,
8348,_ROSE._,"_Fl._                           ’Tis his, my lady."
8349,_ROSE._,
8350,_ROSE._,_R._ Is not this Tristram’s hat?
8351,_ROSE._,
8352,_ROSE._,_D._ (_aside_). Hath he come hither in his servant’s
8353,_ROSE._,clothes?
8354,_ROSE._,
8355,_ROSE._,_Fl._                 It’s Tristram’s hat.
8356,_ROSE._,
8357,_ROSE._,_K._ At least what’s left of it.
8358,_ROSE._,
8359,_ROSE._,_D._                           Came he disguised?
8360,_ROSE._,
8361,_ROSE._,"_Fl._ ’Twas thus, my lady. As he ran down the stairs,"
8362,_ROSE._,I bade him dout the lamp. I did not mean
8363,_ROSE._,That he should burn his hat.
8364,_ROSE._,
8365,_ROSE._,_D._ (_aside_). What can this be?
8366,_ROSE._,"It can’t have been Tristram.—Answer me, Flora:"
8367,_ROSE._,Was it master Tristram visited you to-night?      2301
8368,_ROSE._,
8369,_ROSE._,"_Fl._ Of course, my lady. I’d not deny it."
8370,_ROSE._,
8371,_ROSE._,_D._ (_aside_).                          I see!
8372,_ROSE._,"After all, only Tristram.—Came he alone?"
8373,_ROSE._,Answer me at once.
8374,_ROSE._,
8375,_ROSE._,"_Fl._            I am much ashamed, my lady,"
8376,_ROSE._,"He came alone. And yet, my lady, I swear"
8377,_ROSE._,"I never bade him; nor asked him, for that matter."
8378,_ROSE._,"I heard his step, and found him waiting there"
8379,_ROSE._,By the big clock. How he came in I know not.
8380,_ROSE._,
8381,_ROSE._,_D._ Enough: I shall discover. All leave but Flora.
8382,_ROSE._,
8383,_ROSE._,[_Exeunt maids except Fl._
8384,_ROSE._,
8385,_ROSE._,(_Aside._) Thank heaven they have not guessed ... and
8386,_ROSE._,yet how nearly                             2310
8387,_ROSE._,"My jealousy betrayed me! (_To Fl._) I told you, Flora,"
8388,_ROSE._,I shall discharge you. Tho’I do not doubt
8389,_ROSE._,"Tristram came here without your invitation,"
8390,_ROSE._,Yet in concealing his pretensions from me
8391,_ROSE._,"You have disobeyed,—deceived me."
8392,_ROSE._,
8393,_ROSE._,_Fl._                           I was afraid
8394,_ROSE._,My lady would forbid him.
8395,_ROSE._,
8396,_ROSE._,"_D._                    Silence, girl!"
8397,_ROSE._,Go to your room. I’ll speak of this to-morrow.
8398,_ROSE._,
8399,_ROSE._,_Fl._ I hope my lady will forgive his boldness.
8400,_ROSE._,I have told my lady all.
8401,_ROSE._,
8402,_ROSE._,_D._                   Begone! begone!      [_Exit Fl._
8403,_ROSE._,"(_To R._) What think you of this, Ricardo?      2320"
8404,_ROSE._,
8405,_ROSE._,_R._ ’Tis the wrong fox we have hunted.
8406,_ROSE._,
8407,_ROSE._,"_D._                                  Ah, I think"
8408,_ROSE._,Fox is the word. I half believe that Frederick
8409,_ROSE._,And Tristram are in league.
8410,_ROSE._,
8411,_ROSE._,_R._                      I guessed the truth
8412,_ROSE._,When Flora first confessed.
8413,_ROSE._,
8414,_ROSE._,_D._                      I was too hot.
8415,_ROSE._,
8416,_ROSE._,_R._ You think too ill of Frederick.
8417,_ROSE._,
8418,_ROSE._,"_D._                               Nay, Ricardo:"
8419,_ROSE._,Do not defend him. ’Tis enough to shame him
8420,_ROSE._,That Tristram is his servant.
8421,_ROSE._,
8422,_ROSE._,_G._                        I pray my lady
8423,_ROSE._,Will now retire.
8424,_ROSE._,
8425,_ROSE._,"_D._           Yes, true, Sir Gregory."
8426,_ROSE._,"’Tis time, high time. And let this trophy here"
8427,_ROSE._,Be sent to its owner; and to-morrow morning      2330
8428,_ROSE._,"Bid him come speak with me. Tell him, Ricardo."
8429,_ROSE._,"Good-night.      [_Exit Gregory lighting her out_, R."
8430,_ROSE._,
8431,_ROSE._,_R._ I am now secure of her: since in my presence
8432,_ROSE._,She hath so consented to disgrace her idol.

8497,_TRISTRAM._,dismissed you from her household. That saves me explanation. Here’s
8498,_TRISTRAM._,your wages (_puts money on the table_) for the current quarter. You are

8536,_TRISTRAM._,
8537,_TRISTRAM._,_F._ ’Tis this. An hour from hence I must be off.
8538,_TRISTRAM._,St. Nicholas will likely enough be here      2391
8539,_TRISTRAM._,"After his marriage settlement. Now, Tristram,"

8541,_TRISTRAM._,"And if he comes, get him out of the way."
8542,_TRISTRAM._,"And if Ricardo comes, tell him that I"
8543,_TRISTRAM._,Am gone to seek him and shall soon return:

8550,_TRISTRAM._,"of love: or rather, I should say, it all came of my hat."
8551,_TRISTRAM._,I would it had been consumed entirely. This hole in
8552,_TRISTRAM._,the crown is not to be mended ... and all round
8553,_TRISTRAM._,"’tis like tinder, it breaks with a touch. Of what contemptible"
8554,_TRISTRAM._,material are these hats made! It might have
8555,_TRISTRAM._,"been sewn up else. Now ’tis a picture of me. Yes, the"
8556,_TRISTRAM._,"hat is me, as it were; the hole in the crown is the ruin"
8557,_TRISTRAM._,"of my fortunes wrought upon me by the fiery lamp,"
8558,_TRISTRAM._,which is my love for Flora. There’s a parable. Could
8559,_TRISTRAM._,"I write a poem on this, it might appease the Countess."
8560,_TRISTRAM._,Deary me! What are Flora and I to do? Money being
8561,_TRISTRAM._,"the root of all evil, I must look first to that. All"
8562,_TRISTRAM._,depends on that. Let me see what I can muster.
8563,_TRISTRAM._,"There’s my pay; there’s the Countess’present, and"
8564,_TRISTRAM._,my little savings. (_turns out his purse and pockets on to
8565,_TRISTRAM._,"the table._) I’ll put it all in heaps of ten. No, heaps"
8566,_TRISTRAM._,"of five: better in fives, there’ll be more heaps; and"
8567,_TRISTRAM._,there’s comfort in the number of heaps. Tho’less

8618,_ST. NICHOLAS._,could weave in with that your sphinx and something
8619,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"about death, I think that I might tickle the Countess’"

8799,_GREGORY._,"’Tis here, then: not in the chimney. Eh!—who’s here?"
8800,_GREGORY._,(_Opens cupboard._) St. Nicholas!
8801,_GREGORY._,
8802,_GREGORY._,"_N._        O, Sir Gregory, you would not hear."
8803,_GREGORY._,
8804,_GREGORY._,_G._ Who shut you in the cupboard?
8805,_GREGORY._,
8806,_GREGORY._,_N._                             Tristram.
8807,_GREGORY._,
8808,_GREGORY._,_G._                                     Tristram?
8809,_GREGORY._,
8810,_GREGORY._,_N._ _assents._
8811,_GREGORY._,
8812,_GREGORY._,_G._ And is this Laura’s glove? Look at it.
8813,_GREGORY._,
8814,_GREGORY._,_N._ (_nodding_). It is.
8815,_GREGORY._,
8816,_GREGORY._,_G._ Then tell me: did you bring it here? Could you
8817,_GREGORY._,By any chance have dropped it here?
8818,_GREGORY._,
8819,_GREGORY._,"_N._ (_disclaiming by gesture_).    I? No, sir."
8820,_GREGORY._,I came to seek for Frederick.
8821,_GREGORY._,
8822,_GREGORY._,"_G._ (_to himself_).        What can this mean,      2580"
8823,_GREGORY._,Unless to keep his rival out of the way?—
8824,_GREGORY._,"Listen, St. Nicholas, I have discovered something"
8825,_GREGORY._,Concerns you nearly.—I think—I am sure—
8826,_GREGORY._,Nay: I’ll not tell you what I suspect....
8827,_GREGORY._,"’Tis but suspicion. But you have been, I fear,"
8828,_GREGORY._,Most shamefully beguiled.
8829,_GREGORY._,
8830,_GREGORY._,"_N._                    Ay, that I was."
8831,_GREGORY._,He said that I should find my settlement
8832,_GREGORY._,In the cupboard.
8833,_GREGORY._,
8834,_GREGORY._,_G._           Patience. I will go to Laura
8835,_GREGORY._,"And learn the truth. Meanwhile, seek out the Countess,"
8836,_GREGORY._,And beg her give me an interview at once.      2590
8837,_GREGORY._,"I’ll come to the ante-chamber. By heaven, St. Nicholas...."
8838,_GREGORY._,And yet I scarce know.... There’s no time to lose:

8857,_FREDERICK._,The answer is not urgent: it may keep you
8858,_FREDERICK._,A day or two at Milan.
8859,_FREDERICK._,
8860,_FREDERICK._,"_F._                 You wish, my lady,"
8861,_FREDERICK._,I should return?
8862,_FREDERICK._,
8863,_FREDERICK._,_D._           Why not?
8864,_FREDERICK._,
8865,_FREDERICK._,I understood
8866,_FREDERICK._,Your ladyship to accept my resignation.
8867,_FREDERICK._,It lies with her convenience but to fix      2600
8868,_FREDERICK._,The day of my dismission.
8869,_FREDERICK._,
8870,_FREDERICK._,_D._                    Do you wish
8871,_FREDERICK._,To leave my service?
8872,_FREDERICK._,
8873,_FREDERICK._,_F._               I could never serve
8874,_FREDERICK._,Where I am distrusted.
8875,_FREDERICK._,
8876,_FREDERICK._,_D._                 Would you reconsider
8877,_FREDERICK._,"Your angry speech, I would make some concession."
8878,_FREDERICK._,
8879,_FREDERICK._,_F._ I had cause for anger.
8880,_FREDERICK._,
8881,_FREDERICK._,_D._                      That I would concede.
8882,_FREDERICK._,But I too was provoked; and in the end
8883,_FREDERICK._,I came off worst.
8884,_FREDERICK._,
8885,_FREDERICK._,"_F._            Not so, my lady."
8886,_FREDERICK._,
8887,_FREDERICK._,_D._                           I sought
8888,_FREDERICK._,"To learn your secret, and was merely fooled."
8889,_FREDERICK._,
8890,_FREDERICK._,_F._ I understand not how your ladyship
8891,_FREDERICK._,"Was first provoked,—at least with me."
8892,_FREDERICK._,
8893,_FREDERICK._,"_D._                                 Nay, true:      2610"
8894,_FREDERICK._,"’Twas a mistake. We need no explanation,"
8895,_FREDERICK._,And may be friends again.
8896,_FREDERICK._,
8897,_FREDERICK._,_F._                    I cannot offer
8898,_FREDERICK._,Her ladyship my services.
8899,_FREDERICK._,
8900,_FREDERICK._,_D._                    You leave me?
8901,_FREDERICK._,
8902,_FREDERICK._,_F._ ’Tis better that I should. I thank your ladyship
8903,_FREDERICK._,For many kindnesses. I pray sincerely
8904,_FREDERICK._,You may be better suited.
8905,_FREDERICK._,
8906,_FREDERICK._,"_D._                    No fear for that,"
8907,_FREDERICK._,Frederick: for by my soul I think      2617
8908,_FREDERICK._,There is no other man would so have wronged me
8909,_FREDERICK._,As thou hast done.... My only fault hath been      2619
8910,_FREDERICK._,To have thought too well of thee. But do not dream
8911,_FREDERICK._,"I am unprepared. I have seen thro’thee, Frederick;"
8912,_FREDERICK._,"Yes, thro’and thro’. My offers of concession"
8913,_FREDERICK._,"I made to prove thee, lest thou shouldst pretend"
8914,_FREDERICK._,That I was unforgiving. In the letter
8915,_FREDERICK._,"I have writ the Duke, thou bearest the commission"
8916,_FREDERICK._,Of thy successor. Henceforth I reject thee:
8917,_FREDERICK._,"And treat thee as thou deservest. Go, sir, go!"
8918,_FREDERICK._,"Indeed, I care not whether you go or not."
8919,_FREDERICK._,
8920,_FREDERICK._,_F._ I have then your leave to stay away?
8921,_FREDERICK._,
8922,_FREDERICK._,_D._                                    My leave?
8923,_FREDERICK._,"I bid thee go, and never see me more.      2630"
8924,_FREDERICK._,"I have done with thee, sir. Go!"
8925,_FREDERICK._,
8926,_FREDERICK._,[_Exit F. bowing._
8927,_FREDERICK._,
8928,_FREDERICK._,And that’s the man I loved; the man for whom
8929,_FREDERICK._,I sank to jealousy. Who is’t he loves?
8930,_FREDERICK._,He love! The fool was right: he loves himself.
8931,_FREDERICK._,"Now will he bide at Milan. Ah, good sir,"
8932,_FREDERICK._,"Thy lady is not there, and yet thou goest"
8933,_FREDERICK._,"Most cheerfully,—thou goest. And it was thou"
8934,_FREDERICK._,"Didst write soft verses: music too,—thy music."
8935,_FREDERICK._,And I thinking I loved thee was betrayed
8936,_FREDERICK._,A thousand times ... and to be scorned—by thee!

8950,_ST. NICHOLAS._,

8952,_ST. NICHOLAS._,at once.
8953,_ST. NICHOLAS._,

8961,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"With all the flock and flue, ’mong cast-off clothes,"
8962,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"Old boots and shoes: call me an ass, a goose,"
8963,_ST. NICHOLAS._,And mock my muse ... a fellow ... a common fellow.
8964,_ST. NICHOLAS._,A man that is the servant of the servant
8965,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Of the adoptive sister of my Laura!
8966,_ST. NICHOLAS._,He shall be swinged. Sir Gregory will right me:
8967,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Sir Gregory will avenge me. Had heaven but given me
8968,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"His inches, why, I’d do it myself. I’d flog him,      2660"

8970,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"Mercy, I pray! No, no: no mercy, sir."

8983,_GREGORY._,You have been betrayed.

8988,_GREGORY._,_G._ And I must see her at once. (_going in._)

8997,_GREGORY._,She said in half an hour.
8998,_GREGORY._,
8999,_GREGORY._,_G._ (_half-aside_).    Why does he stay me?
9000,_GREGORY._,In half an hour he says. What can I do?
9001,_GREGORY._,By that time he’ll be off. (_Aloud._) St. Nicholas!

9008,_GREGORY._,"To bring them back: if she be not within,"
9009,_GREGORY._,Follow. She awaits him somewhere on the road.

9024,_GREGORY._,
9025,_GREGORY._,_N._ Laura with Frederick!
9026,_GREGORY._,
9027,_GREGORY._,"_G._ I went to her room: she’s flown, and with a maid."
9028,_GREGORY._,"She hath packed up clothes and gone. I am right, I am sure."
9029,_GREGORY._,
9030,_GREGORY._,_N._ And shall I stop them?

9032,_GREGORY._,_G._ Lose no more time. Begone! Do as I bid.

9051,_GREGORY._,If I had known—and now no doubt
9052,_GREGORY._,’Tis past all hindrance.... Am I not a fool      2710

9173,_TRISTRAM._,saw the colour of your money before. (_Aside._) More
9174,_TRISTRAM._,ducats!
9175,_TRISTRAM._,
9176,_TRISTRAM._,_R._ No: because you served me better by trying to
9177,_TRISTRAM._,disoblige me. Now I pay you to oblige me in a trifling
9178,_TRISTRAM._,matter. ’Tis to find out Sir Gregory and deliver this
9179,_TRISTRAM._,letter to him.
9180,_TRISTRAM._,
9181,_TRISTRAM._,"_T._ Certainly, sir. Is there anything else that you"
9182,_TRISTRAM._,"may require, sir?"
9183,_TRISTRAM._,
9184,_TRISTRAM._,"_R._ Yes. Just light me a taper, and I’ll seal the"
9185,_TRISTRAM._,"letter. You see I don’t trust you altogether, Tristram:"
9186,_TRISTRAM._,not yet.
9187,_TRISTRAM._,
9188,_TRISTRAM._,"_T._ You may, sir. I want no more of Mr. Frederick’s"
9189,_TRISTRAM._,"secrets. Not that they were at all times unprofitable,"
9190,_TRISTRAM._,though he never himself gave me a penny on their
9191,_TRISTRAM._,account.      2800
9192,_TRISTRAM._,
9193,_TRISTRAM._,_R._ (_having sealed_). Here ’tis. Will you please take
9194,_TRISTRAM._,it at once?
9195,_TRISTRAM._,
9196,_TRISTRAM._,"_T._ (_taking_). I will, sir. (_Aside._) More secrets still:"
9197,_TRISTRAM._,and more ducats. [_Exit._
9198,_TRISTRAM._,
9199,_TRISTRAM._,_R._ Enough should grow to reach Diana’s ears
9200,_TRISTRAM._,From Tristram’s curiosity. Meanwhile
9201,_TRISTRAM._,I’ll watch my time. My rival’s safely gone ...
9202,_TRISTRAM._,But how to face Diana? I think ’tis best
9203,_TRISTRAM._,To take her by surprise: a weaker force      2809
9204,_TRISTRAM._,Then overwhelms. I will go change my dress.      [_Exit._

9218,_FLORA._,
9219,_FLORA._,"I am discharged, Tristram, discharged. The Countess"
9220,_FLORA._,has discharged me for keeping company with you. And
9221,_FLORA._,"she has been crying too, to have to part with me."
9222,_FLORA._,What ever will come to us?
9223,_FLORA._,
9224,_FLORA._,"_T._ What matters? I’ll cheer thee, girl. Look here!"
9225,_FLORA._,More money. There’s five pieces of gold: and all for
9226,_FLORA._,carrying this letter to Sir Gregory. Where is he?
9227,_FLORA._,
9228,_FLORA._,_Fl._ Who gave it you?
9229,_FLORA._,
9230,_FLORA._,"_T._ That Mr. Ricardo. It’s a mystery, Flora: but"
9231,_FLORA._,"there’s something in it, I do believe."
9232,_FLORA._,
9233,_FLORA._,_Fl._ Mr. Ricardo?
9234,_FLORA._,
9235,_FLORA._,"_T._ Ay. Who should he be that scatters gold, and"
9236,_FLORA._,"seals with a crown, look! and says that he will find us"
9237,_FLORA._,"new places, and all sorts of fine promises? A man"
9238,_FLORA._,that would flick me away whenever I came near him.
9239,_FLORA._,
9240,_FLORA._,"_Fl._ Did he, Tristram?      2830"
9241,_FLORA._,
9242,_FLORA._,"_T._ Ay, that he would. But I heard him say once"
9243,_FLORA._,that he came here for his cure. I take it he’s cured now;
9244,_FLORA._,"and he would make friends all on a sudden, and"
9245,_FLORA._,begs me kindly carry this to Sir Gregory. ’Tis his
9246,_FLORA._,"farewell, no doubt. He will go home, and take me"
9247,_FLORA._,with him.
9248,_FLORA._,
9249,_FLORA._,_Fl._ And me too?
9250,_FLORA._,
9251,_FLORA._,_T._ Not if you blubber. Where’s Sir Gregory?
9252,_FLORA._,
9253,_FLORA._,_Fl._ I don’t know. The Countess has bid me go
9254,_FLORA._,seek Lady Laura.      2840
9255,_FLORA._,
9256,_FLORA._,"_T._ Come! I’ll with you as far as the library,"
9257,_FLORA._,where I think I should find the old gentleman.
9258,_FLORA._,

9260,_FLORA._,

9264,_DIANA._,
9265,_DIANA._,Rejected! by the man I loved rejected:
9266,_DIANA._,"Despised by him, and by myself betrayed!"
9267,_DIANA._,And all will know it—I could not hide it.
9268,_DIANA._,
9269,_DIANA._,Our nature hath this need: woman must love.
9270,_DIANA._,"But oh! to have made my idol of a stone,"
9271,_DIANA._,To my wórship a déaf unanswering stone!
9272,_DIANA._,At last I am cured. Since not my rank suffices
9273,_DIANA._,"To set me above the rules I gave my maids,      2850"
9274,_DIANA._,"I’ll never love. Am I to stand and wait,"
9275,_DIANA._,"Till some man fancy me, and then to melt"
9276,_DIANA._,And conjure inclination at a nod?
9277,_DIANA._,"O man, thou art our god: the almighty’s curse"
9278,_DIANA._,Crowns thee our master: from the green-sick girl
9279,_DIANA._,"That mopes in worship of the nearest fool,"
9280,_DIANA._,To the poor jaded wife of thirty years
9281,_DIANA._,"Who dotes upon her striker, ’tis the same...."
9282,_DIANA._,"That’s not for me. Nay, give it up altogether:"
9283,_DIANA._,"Go free. If man’s so base; if that high passion,"
9284,_DIANA._,"That spirit-ecstasy, that supersensual,      2861"
9285,_DIANA._,Conscious devotion of divinity
9286,_DIANA._,"Of which I dreamed, is only to be found"
9287,_DIANA._,"In books of fanciful philosophy,"
9288,_DIANA._,Or tales of pretty poets ... why then away
9289,_DIANA._,With books and men! my life henceforth shall prove
9290,_DIANA._,Woman is self-sufficing: in my court
9291,_DIANA._,"No man shall step, save such as may be needed"
9292,_DIANA._,To show my spirit holds them in contempt.
9293,_DIANA._,Women shall be my friends and women only;      2870
9294,_DIANA._,And I shall find allies. I had in Laura
9295,_DIANA._,"All that I could desire, a friend, unselfish,"
9296,_DIANA._,"Devoted, grateful, and as yet untainted"
9297,_DIANA._,By any folly of love: and her I schemed
9298,_DIANA._,To marry away. ’Tis not too late: I’ll save her:
9299,_DIANA._,She shall not be enslaved: she doth not love.
9300,_DIANA._,Her heart is free and generous; it has shrunk
9301,_DIANA._,By instinct from the yoke: she will join with me;
9302,_DIANA._,"And if I tell her all,—or if she have guessed,—"
9303,_DIANA._,Now when I tell her she will comfort me.      2880
9304,_DIANA._,"Comfort and counsel, friendship, that I need"
9305,_DIANA._,And she can give. I never will part fróm her.
9306,_DIANA._,

9309,_DIANA._,"_Fl._ Oh, my lady: the Lady Laura is gone, she has run away."
9310,_DIANA._,
9311,_DIANA._,_D._ Run away!
9312,_DIANA._,
9313,_DIANA._,_Fl._ Sir Gregory is coming to tell you all about it.
9314,_DIANA._,She has run away with Mr. Frederick.
9315,_DIANA._,
9316,_DIANA._,_D._ Nonsense! How dare you tell me....
9317,_DIANA._,
9318,_DIANA._,_Fl._ I guess it’s true though. I remember now I used
9319,_DIANA._,"to say how strange it was that such a sweet lady, and"
9320,_DIANA._,so clever and proper a gentleman as....      2891
9321,_DIANA._,
9322,_DIANA._,"_D._ Silence, Flora! What has come to you? What"
9323,_DIANA._,makes you say this?
9324,_DIANA._,
9325,_DIANA._,_Fl._ Because she’s not to be found. But Sir Gregory
9326,_DIANA._,will tell you.
9327,_DIANA._,
9328,_DIANA._,"_D._ Send Sir Gregory at once. (_Aside._) This is impossible,"
9329,_DIANA._,impossible.
9330,_DIANA._,
9331,_DIANA._,_Fl._ See here he comes.
9332,_DIANA._,
9333,_DIANA._,_D._ (_aside_). Ah! if this were Frederick’s secret!
9334,_DIANA._,
9335,_DIANA._,_Enter Sir Gregory._
9336,_DIANA._,
9337,_DIANA._,"What is it? Sir Gregory, tell me.      2900"
9338,_DIANA._,
9339,_GREGORY._,_GREGORY._
9340,_GREGORY._,
9341,_GREGORY._,I scarce dare tell your ladyship the tidings
9342,_GREGORY._,I have to bear.
9343,_GREGORY._,
9344,_GREGORY._,_D._ (_aside_). It’s true! it’s true!
9345,_GREGORY._,
9346,_GREGORY._,_G._                                My daughter
9347,_GREGORY._,Has run away with Frederick.
9348,_GREGORY._,
9349,_GREGORY._,(_Diana sinks on a chair; Flora runs to fan her._)
9350,_GREGORY._,
9351,_GREGORY._,Ah! my lady!
9352,_GREGORY._,What have I done? I was too quick.
9353,_GREGORY._,
9354,_GREGORY._,"_D._                             Nay, nay,"
9355,_GREGORY._,"Flora, begone. I can hear all. You knew it?"
9356,_GREGORY._,
9357,_GREGORY._,_G._ I had not the least suspicion of the truth;
9358,_GREGORY._,Altho’it needed but the merest trifle
9359,_GREGORY._,To clear my sight. I chanced to find her glove
9360,_GREGORY._,In Frederick’s room. All flashed upon me at once.
9361,_GREGORY._,I ran to seek her. She was gone. A message      2910
9362,_GREGORY._,"She left was given me, that she would be away"
9363,_GREGORY._,All the afternoon: but since she had taken with her
9364,_GREGORY._,A valise....
9365,_GREGORY._,
9366,_GREGORY._,"_D._       She, ’twas she.... O most dissembling,"
9367,_GREGORY._,"Ungenerous, ungrateful...."
9368,_GREGORY._,
9369,_GREGORY._,_Fl._                    I said ’twas true.
9370,_GREGORY._,
9371,_GREGORY._,_D._ Begone at once I bid you.      [_Exit Flora._
9372,_GREGORY._,
9373,_GREGORY._,_G._                         I ran in haste
9374,_GREGORY._,To tell your ladyship; but for some reason
9375,_GREGORY._,Could not be admitted: so I took such steps
9376,_GREGORY._,To arrest them as I might....
9377,_GREGORY._,
9378,_GREGORY._,_D._                        Ha! they are seized?
9379,_GREGORY._,
9380,_GREGORY._,_G._ I have since repented of my haste: a letter
9381,_GREGORY._,Put in my hands reveals the whole: ’tis passed      2920
9382,_GREGORY._,Beyond prevention. It has been maturing
9383,_GREGORY._,Under our eyes for months. We must give way.
9384,_GREGORY._,’Tis strange we never guessed it. This very morning
9385,_GREGORY._,I was in Laura’s room; and when we parted
9386,_GREGORY._,"She made such long farewells, and looked at me"
9387,_GREGORY._,"With such reluctance, and such brimming eyes,"
9388,_GREGORY._,I saw she had some trouble untold; and thinking
9389,_GREGORY._,"’Twas her dislike of Nicholas, I repented"
9390,_GREGORY._,"I had ever urged the match. I little thought,"
9391,_GREGORY._,"Dear girl, ’twas sorrow that she dared not tell me"
9392,_GREGORY._,Her joy.      2931
9393,_GREGORY._,
9394,_GREGORY._,_D._ (_aside_). Her joy! no doubt! Here’s a fine father!
9395,_GREGORY._,"What doth he wish? Ah, doubly have I been fooled."
9396,_GREGORY._,How plain ’tis now to see. The only one
9397,_GREGORY._,I have never once suspected; the only one
9398,_GREGORY._,It could have been. And Frederick must have told her
9399,_GREGORY._,My love of him. All I would have kept secret
9400,_GREGORY._,"And thought was hid, hath been as open as day:"
9401,_GREGORY._,And what I sought to learn hath been kept from me
9402,_GREGORY._,By them I trusted to discover it.
9403,_GREGORY._,"Tristram, no doubt, whom I supposed a fool,      2940"
9404,_GREGORY._,Hath merely played with me. Thank heaven they are gone.
9405,_GREGORY._,I’ll never see him again. Befooled: befooled.
9406,_GREGORY._,
9407,_GREGORY._,_G._ They have been befriended by the Duke of Milan.
9408,_GREGORY._,
9409,_GREGORY._,_D._ The Duke of Milan too!
9410,_GREGORY._,
9411,_GREGORY._,_G._                      It was his letter
9412,_GREGORY._,"I spake of. Frederick is, he tells me there,"
9413,_GREGORY._,"His old school-friend; he begs my pardon for him,"
9414,_GREGORY._,"Will fête the bride and bridegroom in his palace,"
9415,_GREGORY._,And have the Archbishop marry them. ’Tis thither
9416,_GREGORY._,They are fled.
9417,_GREGORY._,
9418,_GREGORY._,_D._         Then all this is a plot of the Duke’s!
9419,_GREGORY._,
9420,_GREGORY._,_G._ (_aside_). I dare not tell her more.      2950
9421,_GREGORY._,
9422,_GREGORY._,_D._                              Who brought the letter?
9423,_GREGORY._,
9424,_GREGORY._,_G._ I wish my dear girl joy. She has chosen well.
9425,_GREGORY._,
9426,_GREGORY._,_D._ Who brought the letter?
9427,_GREGORY._,
9428,_GREGORY._,_G._                       Tristram gave it me.
9429,_GREGORY._,
9430,_GREGORY._,_D._ (_half-aside_). How came he by it?
9431,_GREGORY._,
9432,_GREGORY._,_Re-enter Tristram._
9433,_GREGORY._,
9434,_GREGORY._,_T._ My lady! I have something now.
9435,_GREGORY._,
9436,_GREGORY._,"_D._ Tristram, I bade you leave the court: how dare you"
9437,_GREGORY._,Appear before me again?
9438,_GREGORY._,"Silence, I say. I know your news: you have served"
9439,_GREGORY._,"Your master with such lying skill, I wonder"
9440,_GREGORY._,He did not take you and your Flora with him:
9441,_GREGORY._,There was not room enough perhaps in the coach
9442,_GREGORY._,For two such couples.
9443,_GREGORY._,
9444,_GREGORY._,"_T._                How, if you please, my lady,      2960"
9445,_GREGORY._,Are Flora and I two couples?
9446,_GREGORY._,
9447,_GREGORY._,_D._                       Silence. Tell me
9448,_GREGORY._,How you get letters from the Duke of Milan.
9449,_GREGORY._,
9450,_GREGORY._,_T._ How I get letters from the Duke of Milan?
9451,_GREGORY._,
9452,_GREGORY._,"_D._ There’s nothing now to hide, so tell the truth."
9453,_GREGORY._,
9454,_GREGORY._,"_T._ I swear, my lady, that I know no more"
9455,_GREGORY._,Of the Duke of Milan than a babe unborn.
9456,_GREGORY._,Your ladyship accused me once before
9457,_GREGORY._,"Of having been at Milan, when ’twas plain"
9458,_GREGORY._,"That I had not gone, and never wished to go."
9459,_GREGORY._,"Knowing my lady’s strong impartiality,      2970"
9460,_GREGORY._,I should not venture.
9461,_GREGORY._,
9462,_GREGORY._,_D._                This will not do.
9463,_GREGORY._,
9464,_GREGORY._,_Enter Ricardo._
9465,_GREGORY._,
9466,_GREGORY._,"(_Gregory beckons Tristram aside, and during Diana’s first speech"
9467,_GREGORY._,"whispers him, and Gregory and Tristram go out._)"
9468,_GREGORY._,
9469,_RICARDO._,_RICARDO._
9470,_RICARDO._,
9471,_RICARDO._,My lady.
9472,_RICARDO._,The culprit is discovered.
9473,_RICARDO._,
9474,_RICARDO._,"_D._                     Ah, Ricardo!"
9475,_RICARDO._,I had forgot ... was this thy plan? ... if so
9476,_RICARDO._,I cannot praise thy skill sufficiently.
9477,_RICARDO._,All hath gone well. And since no doubt thou hast served
9478,_RICARDO._,"Thy master and his friend in all thou hast done,"
9479,_RICARDO._,And under the pretence of aiding me
9480,_RICARDO._,"Hast been the ready man, more than another,"
9481,_RICARDO._,"To practise on me, and do me injury;"
9482,_RICARDO._,I’ll school my patience till I have satisfied      2980
9483,_RICARDO._,My curiosity to know what thought
9484,_RICARDO._,"Urged thee,—whom I confess I wholly trusted,"
9485,_RICARDO._,"And whom I thought to have made my friend,—that thus"
9486,_RICARDO._,"Against the laws of hospitality,"
9487,_RICARDO._,"Without the excuse of passion, thou shouldst wrong"
9488,_RICARDO._,A lady so unkindly.
9489,_RICARDO._,
9490,_RICARDO._,"_R._              Ah, Diana!"
9491,_RICARDO._,Hast thou not guessed my secret?
9492,_RICARDO._,
9493,_RICARDO._,"_D._                           By heaven, sir,"
9494,_RICARDO._,Did the Duke send thee here to insult me too?
9495,_RICARDO._,
9496,_RICARDO._,"_R._ Dearest Diana, I am the Duke of Milan."
9497,_RICARDO._,
9498,_RICARDO._,_D._ Ha! thou! Thy face behind the bush. ’Tis thou.
9499,_RICARDO._,Should I have known it? No. I can thank God
9500,_RICARDO._,I knew it so little. By help tho’of thy acts
9501,_RICARDO._,"I recognize your grace. ’Tis like thee indeed,"
9502,_RICARDO._,That hast not scrupled thus to steal upon me
9503,_RICARDO._,"Masked and disguised; by forgery and falsehood,"
9504,_RICARDO._,"Written recommendations of thyself,"
9505,_RICARDO._,Making thee out to be some gentleman      3000
9506,_RICARDO._,"Of trust and honour. Oh ’tis admirable,"
9507,_RICARDO._,"The use thou makest of thy rank, to creep"
9508,_RICARDO._,"Into my secresy, thereby to assist"
9509,_RICARDO._,"Thy friend, my secretary, to elope"
9510,_RICARDO._,"With an orphan and my ward. Haste, haste! I bid thee;"
9511,_RICARDO._,Lest thou be late for the feast. Bear them from me
9512,_RICARDO._,My glad congratulations. (_sinks on a chair._)
9513,_RICARDO._,
9514,_RICARDO._,_R._ (_running to her_). Diana! Diana!
9515,_RICARDO._,
9516,_RICARDO._,"_D._ I need no aid from thee, sir. Nay, begone!"
9517,_RICARDO._,
9518,_RICARDO._,_R._ In kindness hear what I came here to say.
9519,_RICARDO._,In justice hear my answer to the charges      3010
9520,_RICARDO._,Thou hast made. But first I claim my promise.
9521,_RICARDO._,
9522,_RICARDO._,_D._                                        How!
9523,_RICARDO._,"What promise, sir?"
9524,_RICARDO._,
9525,_RICARDO._,_R._             Your secretary’s place
9526,_RICARDO._,If Frederick left.
9527,_RICARDO._,
9528,_RICARDO._,_D._             Make you me still your jest?
9529,_RICARDO._,
9530,_RICARDO._,"_R._ O dearest Diana, think not that I jest."
9531,_RICARDO._,"I’d be thy secretary all my life,"
9532,_RICARDO._,So I might only take the place which Frederick
9533,_RICARDO._,Held in thy affections.
9534,_RICARDO._,
9535,_RICARDO._,"_D._ (_rising_).      In my affections! why,"
9536,_RICARDO._,"What means your grace, I beg?"
9537,_RICARDO._,
9538,_RICARDO._,"_R._                        Diana, Diana!"
9539,_RICARDO._,Have I not won thee? Did I not obey thee
9540,_RICARDO._,"By silence and long absence, till my life      3020"
9541,_RICARDO._,"Grew desperate, and my misery made me bold"
9542,_RICARDO._,To come to thee disguised? I thought that thou
9543,_RICARDO._,Perchance wert adverse to my suit for thinking
9544,_RICARDO._,"I loved thee only for thy beauty’s sake,—"
9545,_RICARDO._,"Since at first sight I loved and only sight,—"
9546,_RICARDO._,And for thy mind’s grace thou wert rightly jealous
9547,_RICARDO._,"Of such a passion. Now, if I guess well,"
9548,_RICARDO._,I have won some favour in these happy days....
9549,_RICARDO._,
9550,_RICARDO._,_D._ Favour!

9553,_RICARDO._,"’Tis no impediment: for first this man,      3030"
9554,_RICARDO._,Whom thou hast honoured is my nearest friend;
9555,_RICARDO._,And not to have loved him were to have disregarded
9556,_RICARDO._,The only part of me thou ever knewest.
9557,_RICARDO._,"But him, for very lack of loving rightly"
9558,_RICARDO._,"Thou hast much mistaken and wronged, and, as I think,"
9559,_RICARDO._,Now for misunderstanding bearest ill-will.
9560,_RICARDO._,
9561,_RICARDO._,"_D._ I bear him no ill-will, your grace."

9564,_RICARDO._,
9565,_RICARDO._,_D._ But what you have done?
9566,_RICARDO._,
9567,_RICARDO._,_R._                       Love can excuse me all.
9568,_RICARDO._,What woman judges by proprieties
9569,_RICARDO._,"The man who would die for her, and who without her"

9573,_RICARDO._,
9574,_RICARDO._,_R._                                   ’Tis thus:
9575,_RICARDO._,"If I am not pardoned, I am not loved; but if"
9576,_RICARDO._,"I am loved, I am pardoned. If thou sayst to me"
9577,_RICARDO._,"I never knew thee, but I know thee now,"
9578,_RICARDO._,And like thee not: thy three years’love for me
9579,_RICARDO._,"I count for nothing, thy devotion nothing,"
9580,_RICARDO._,Thy misery nothing: thy adventure here
9581,_RICARDO._,I set against thee; and the hour thou goest
9582,_RICARDO._,"I shall lose nothing: If thou canst say this,      3050"
9583,_RICARDO._,Speak ... and I promise
9584,_RICARDO._,To turn away for ever. Is that thy mind?
9585,_RICARDO._,
9586,_RICARDO._,_D._ Is’t possible?
9587,_RICARDO._,
9588,_RICARDO._,_R._              What possible?

9592,_RICARDO._,"_R._ My love? Nay, love’s a miracle, a thing"
9593,_RICARDO._,"That cannot be where it seems possible,"
9594,_RICARDO._,And where ’tis most incredible is most worth
9595,_RICARDO._,Our credit.
9596,_RICARDO._,
9597,_RICARDO._,_D._      That is true.
9598,_RICARDO._,
9599,_RICARDO._,_R._                    That thou didst doubt
9600,_RICARDO._,Was worthy of the greatness of my love.
9601,_RICARDO._,"But now I claim thy faith. Thou mayst believe,"
9602,_RICARDO._,"Thou must believe. Indeed, indeed, Diana,      3060"
9603,_RICARDO._,Thou mayst believe. Look’st thou to find love strong?
9604,_RICARDO._,I have heavenly security:—devoted?
9605,_RICARDO._,I have no self but thee:—patient? I plead
9606,_RICARDO._,Three years of patience:—humble? I was content
9607,_RICARDO._,To be thy servant:—wise? I knew thee better
9608,_RICARDO._,Than thou thyself; I knew that thou must love:
9609,_RICARDO._,Or is love tender?—See my childish tears
9610,_RICARDO._,Crowd now to hear my sentence.
9611,_RICARDO._,
9612,_RICARDO._,"_D._                         Ah, this were love,"

9615,_RICARDO._,"_R._         Diana, it is so."
9616,_RICARDO._,"There is nought to-day in all the world but this,"

9620,_RICARDO._,"Thou bringst me, or at least thou seemst to bring me,"
9621,_RICARDO._,The gift of God. Whether it be so or no
9622,_RICARDO._,How can I tell? ’Twould wrong it—nay I cannot
9623,_RICARDO._,Take it in haste. I cannot. I understand.
9624,_RICARDO._,"Nay, leave me. I know not what to say ... your blind"

9643,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Was making love to Laura in the coach.
9644,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
9645,_ST. NICHOLAS._,_R._ Now now! how’s this? Frederick so soon returned;
9646,_ST. NICHOLAS._,And taken by the honeysucker!

9648,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"_N._                        Sir,"
9649,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Your honeysucking Frederick would have robbed
9650,_ST. NICHOLAS._,My sweetest flower: but like a skimming swallow
9651,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"That takes a fly in his beak, I snapped him up"
9652,_ST. NICHOLAS._,At the park gate.
9653,_ST. NICHOLAS._,

9656,_ST. NICHOLAS._,
9657,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"_N._                My lady, speak."
9658,_ST. NICHOLAS._,What shall be done to them that have infringed
9659,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"The laws of the court? Whatever punishment,"
9660,_ST. NICHOLAS._,I pray it fall on Frederick with more weight
9661,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Than on my Laura. I would not have such rigour
9662,_ST. NICHOLAS._,As might defer our marriage.

9672,_ST. NICHOLAS._,One only honourable course is left—
9673,_ST. NICHOLAS._,My judgment on you is that you be married
9674,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"As soon as may be. Therefore, Frederick,"
9675,_ST. NICHOLAS._,I beg that you will draw the contract up
9676,_ST. NICHOLAS._,Between yourself and Laura with all speed.
9677,_ST. NICHOLAS._,"And that my sister shall not lack a portion,"
9678,_ST. NICHOLAS._,I will endow her with as goodly a sum
9679,_ST. NICHOLAS._,As what St. Nicholas promised. Now this time

9694,_FREDERICK._,_R._ (_to F._). I have won. (_aloud._) And let me say
9695,_FREDERICK._,That I for friendship’s sake will do as much
9696,_FREDERICK._,Toward Lady Laura’s portion as the Countess.
9697,_FREDERICK._,
9698,_FREDERICK._,_N._ Sir Gregory ... Sir Gregory!
9699,_FREDERICK._,Is this the way I am treated? You do not hear?

9701,_FREDERICK._,
9702,_FREDERICK._,"_G._ (_to N._). I hear not what is said, St. Nicholas:"
9703,_FREDERICK._,But I can see: and since you have caught your bride      3130
9704,_FREDERICK._,"Running away, you must not look to me"
9705,_FREDERICK._,To help you hold her. Surely what I promised
9706,_FREDERICK._,I promised in good faith: but what hath happened
9707,_FREDERICK._,Sets me at liberty. (_Laura goes to Gregory._)
9708,_FREDERICK._,
9709,_FREDERICK._,_N._              And I am left out?

9728,_FREDERICK._,
9729,_FREDERICK._,"_D._             No need for that, your grace;"

9763,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"This play, named after the chorus, is on the same subject as Calderon’s"

9765,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"is directly taken. Some of the differences are historic, but the"
9766,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"most dramatic. _Sala ben Sala_, whose fine figure is substituted for"
9767,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"_Muley_, is a famous warrior; and the whole story has this claim on"
9768,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"English attention, that the Portuguese Regulus, _Ferdinand_, and"
9769,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"his brother _Henry_, ‘_the Navigator_’ of more solid renown, were"
9770,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"grandchildren of _John of Gaunt_, through his daughter _Philippa_, who"
9771,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,was married to _King Joam I_. The history is shortly given in the _King

9777,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,In the first edition the hymn _Jesu dulcis memoria_ is directed to
9778,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,be sung to the music written for it by Allegri and Anerio. This was
9779,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,intended to indicate the sort of polyphonic music which I imagined for
9780,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,the stage effect. As the date of the play must be about 1420 its use
9781,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,"would be an anachronism, but it is one that would never be observed,"
9782,THE CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES,and it may therefore fairly be allowed.

9789,THE HUMOURS OF THE COURT,"_The Humours of the Court_ is founded on two Spanish comedies, which"
9790,THE HUMOURS OF THE COURT,"when I read them, appeared to me to be variations of the same story."
9791,THE HUMOURS OF THE COURT,"These are Calderon’s _El secreto á voces_, and Lope’s _El perro del"
9792,THE HUMOURS OF THE COURT,hortelano_; the latter already used by Molière. My play owes its plot
9793,THE HUMOURS OF THE COURT,"to Calderon, and to Lope the first scene of its third act, which is the"
9794,THE HUMOURS OF THE COURT,opening scene of _El perro del hortelano_. But since in that play the
