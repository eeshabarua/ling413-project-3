29,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON
30,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
31,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
32,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"From Bern rode forth King Diderik,"
33,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,A stately warrior form;
34,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Engaged in fray he found in the way
35,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,A lion and laidly worm. {5}
36,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
37,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"They fought for a day, they fought for two,"
38,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"But ere the third was flown,"
39,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"The worm outfought the beast, and brought"
40,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,To earth the lion down.
41,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
42,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Then cried the lion in his need
43,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,When he the warrior saw:
44,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“O aid me quick, King Diderik,"
45,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,To ’scape the Dragon’s claw.
46,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
47,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“O aid me quick, King Diderik,"
48,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,For the mighty God thou fearest;
49,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"A lion save for the lion brave,"
50,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Which on thy shield thou bearest.
51,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
52,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Come to my rescue, thou noble King,"
53,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Help, help me for thy name;"
54,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Upon thy targe I stand at large,"
55,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Glittering like a flame.”
56,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
57,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Long, long stood he, King Diderik,"
58,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Deep musing thereupon;
59,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,At length he cried: “Whate’er betide
60,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"I’ll help thee, noble one.”"
61,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
62,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"It was Sir King Diderik,"
63,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,His good sword bare he made:
64,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"With courage fraught, the worm he fought,"
65,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Till blood tinged all the blade.
66,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
67,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The gallant lord would not delay
68,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,So fast his blows he dealt;
69,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,He hacked and gored until his sword
70,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Was sundered at the hilt.
71,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
72,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"The Lindworm took him upon her back,"
73,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The horse beneath her tongue;
74,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,To her mountain den she hurried then
75,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,To her eleven young.
76,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
77,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"The horse she cast before her young,"
78,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The man in a nook she throws:
79,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Assuage your greed upon the steed,"
80,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,But I will to repose.
81,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
82,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“I pray ye feed upon the steed,"
83,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,At present no more I can;
84,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"When I upleap, refreshed, from sleep,"
85,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,We’ll feast upon the man.”
86,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
87,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"It was Sir King Diderik,"
88,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,In the hill he searched around;
89,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Then, helped by the Lord, the famous sword"
90,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Called Adelring he found.
91,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
92,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Aye there he found so sharp a sword,"
93,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And a knife with a golden heft:
94,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“King Sigfred be God’s grace with thee,"
95,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,For here thy life was reft!
96,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
97,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“I’ve been with thee in many a fight,"
98,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"In many an inroad too,"
99,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,But that thy doom had been in this tomb
100,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"I never, never knew.”"
101,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
102,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"It was Sir King Diderik,"
103,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Would prove the faulchion’s might;
104,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,He hewed upon the flinty stone
105,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,’Till all around was light.
106,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
107,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,It was the youngest Lindworm saw
108,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The sparks the hill illume:
109,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,“Who dares awake the fiery snake
110,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,In her own sleeping room?”
111,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
112,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"The Lindworm gnashed its teeth with rage,"
113,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Its grinning fangs it show’d:
114,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,“Who dares awake the mother snake
115,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Within her own abode?”
116,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
117,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Then spake the other little ones,"
118,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,From the dark nooks of the hill:
119,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“If from her sleep the old one leap,"
120,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,’Twill fare with thee but ill.”
121,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
122,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Then answered Sir King Diderik,"
123,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,His eyes with fury gleam:
124,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,“I will awake your mother snake
125,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"With chilly, chilly dream."
126,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
127,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Your mother she King Sigfred slew,"
128,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,A man of noble line;
129,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,I’ll on ye all avenge his fall
130,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,With this good hand of mine.”
131,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
132,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"And then awaked the Lindworm old,"
133,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And on her fell such fear:
134,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,“Who thus with riot disturbs my quiet?
135,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,What noise is this I hear?”
136,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
137,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Then said King Diderik: “’Tis I,"
138,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And this have I to say:
139,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"O’er hill and dale, ’neath thy crooked tail,"
140,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Thou brought’st me yesterday.”
141,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
142,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“O hew me not, King Diderik,"
143,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,I’ll give thee all my hoard;
144,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"’Twere best that we good friends should be,"
145,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,So cast away thy sword.”
146,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
147,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“I pay no trust to thy false device,"
148,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Befool me thou wouldst fain;
149,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Full many hast thou destroyed ere now,"
150,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Thou never shalt again.”
151,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
152,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Hear me, Sir King Diderik,"
153,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Forbear to do me ill,"
154,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"And thee I’ll guide to thy plighted bride,"
155,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,She’s hidden in the hill.
156,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
157,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Above by my head, King Diderik,"
158,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Is hung the little key;
159,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Below by my feet to the maiden sweet
160,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Descend thou fearlessly.”
161,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
162,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Above by thy head, thou serpent curst,"
163,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,To begin I now intend;
164,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Below by thy feet, as is full meet,"
165,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,I soon shall make an end.”
166,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
167,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Then first the laidly worm he slew,"
168,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And then her young he smote;
169,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"But in vain did he try from the mountain to fly,"
170,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,For tongues of snakes thrust out.
171,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
172,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,So then with toil in the rocky soil
173,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"He dug a trench profound,"
174,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,That in the flood of serpent blood
175,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And bane he might not be drowned.
176,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
177,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Then bann’d the good King Diderik,"
178,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,On the lion he wroth became:
179,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Bann’d, bann’d,” said he, “may the lion be,"
180,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Confusion be his and shame.”
181,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
182,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,“With subtle thought the brute has brought
183,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,On me this grievous risk;
184,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Which I ne’er had seen had he not been
185,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Graved on my buckler’s disc.”
186,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
187,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And when the gallant lion heard
188,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The King bewail his hap:
189,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“Stand fast, good lord,” the lion roared,"
190,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,“While with my claws I scrap.”
191,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
192,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"The lion scrapp’d, King Diderik hewed,"
193,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Bright sparks the gloom relieved;
194,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Unless the beast had the knight released
195,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,He’d soon to death have grieved.
196,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
197,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"So when he had slain the laidly worm,"
198,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And her offspring all had kill’d;
199,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Escaped the knight to the morning light,"
200,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,With heavy cuirass and shield.
201,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
202,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And when he had now come out of the hill
203,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,For his gallant courser he sighed;
204,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"With reason good he trust him could,"
205,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,For they had each other tried.
206,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
207,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"“O there’s no need to bewail the steed,"
208,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Which thou, Sir King, hast miss’d;"
209,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"I am thy friend, my back ascend,"
210,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And ride where’er thou list.”
211,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
212,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"So he rode o’er the deepest dales,"
213,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,And o’er the verdant meads;
214,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"The knight he rode, the lion strode,"
215,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Through the dim forest glades.
216,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
217,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The lion and King Diderik
218,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Together thenceforth remain;
219,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,"Each death had braved, and the other saved"
220,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,From peril sore and pain.
221,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
222,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Where’er King Diderik rode in the fields
223,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,The lion beside him sped;
224,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,When on the ground the knight sat down
225,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,In his bosom he laid his head.
226,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
227,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Wherefore they call him the lion knight
228,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,With fame that name he bore;
229,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Their love so great did ne’er abate
230,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,Until their dying hour.
231,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
232,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
233,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
234,KING DIDERIK AND THE LION’S FIGHT WITH THE DRAGON,
235,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE
236,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
237,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
238,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,With his eighteen brothers Diderik stark
239,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Dwells in the hills of Bern;
240,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"And each I wot twelve sons has got,"
241,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,For manly feats they yearn.
242,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
243,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"He has twelve sisters, each of them"
244,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,A dozen sons can show;
245,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Thirteen the youngest, gallant lads,"
246,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Of fear who nothing know.
247,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
248,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,To stand before the King a crowd
249,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Of giant bodies move;
250,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,I say to ye forsooth their heads
251,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,O’ertopped the beechen grove.
252,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
253,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“With knights of pride we war have plied
254,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"For many, many a year;"
255,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Of Olger, who in Denmark reigns,"
256,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Such mighty things we hear.
257,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
258,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“Men talk so fain of Olger Dane
259,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Who dwells in Jutland’s fields;
260,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Crowned is his head with gold so red,"
261,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,No tribute us he yields.”
262,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
263,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Then Swerting took a mace, and shook"
264,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,That mace right furiously:
265,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“From ten times ten of Olger’s men
266,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,I would not look to flee!”
267,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
268,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Hark, Swerting, hark, of visage dark,"
269,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Esteem them not so little;
270,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,I’d have thee ken that Olger’s men
271,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Are knights of gallant mettle.
272,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
273,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“They feel no fright for faulchions,"
274,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,For arrows no dismay;
275,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"The desperate fight is their delight,"
276,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,They deem it children’s play.”
277,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
278,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Then cried the mighty man of Bern,"
279,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,When pondered long had he:
280,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“To Denmark we will wend, and learn"
281,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,At home if Olger be.”
282,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
283,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"They took their route from Berner land,"
284,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,They eighteen thousand were;
285,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"King Olger good they visit would,"
286,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,And to Denmark all repair.
287,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
288,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,A messenger by Diderik sent
289,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,To Danish Olger goes:
290,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Say, will ye tribute pay to us,"
291,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Or with us bandy blows?”
292,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
293,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Then full of wrath King Olger grew,"
294,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Such speech he could not bear:
295,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Let Diderik meet us on the wold,"
296,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,We’ll battle with him there.
297,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
298,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Tribute to pay each Dane would scorn,"
299,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,He’s wont himself to take it;
300,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Our tribute ye will like but ill,"
301,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,If ye come here to seek it.”
302,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
303,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,His kemps then gathering in a ring
304,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,The news to them he told:
305,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“Bern’s haughty lord has sent us word
306,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,That he’ll have tribute-gold.
307,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
308,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“He’ll either tribute have, or hold"
309,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,With us a bloody feud;
310,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,But the first King he will not be
311,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,We have this year subdued.”
312,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
313,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Then cried in scorn a kempion good,"
314,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,King Diderik’s envoy to:
315,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“To waste our home if Berners come
316,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,They all hence out won’t go.”
317,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
318,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Soon as the news he heard, full glad"
319,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Was Ulf Van Yern, and gay;"
320,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Then laughed outright bold Hogen knight:
321,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“Too long do they delay.”
322,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
323,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"It was Vidrik Verlandson,"
324,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,High beat with joy his heart;
325,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Then said amain Orm Ungerswayne:
326,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“To meet them let us start.”
327,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
328,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“The first man I’ll be in the van,”"
329,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Sir Ivor Blue he cried:
330,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Nor shall ye say that I was last,”"
331,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Sir Kulden Gray replied.
332,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
333,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,King Olger on the verdant wold
334,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,With Diderik battle join’d;
335,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"To fight they went, no jest they meant,"
336,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,So wroth were they in mind.
337,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
338,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Endured for three long days the fray,"
339,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,And flinch would neither side;
340,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,To help his lord each Dane his sword
341,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,In desperation plied.
342,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
343,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Down ran the blood, like raging flood"
344,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Which ’neath steep hills doth pour;
345,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Then tribute they were forced to pay
346,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Who tribute asked before.
347,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
348,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Rose in the sky the blood-reek high,"
349,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,And dimmed the lustrous sun;
350,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,’Twas sad to spy the brave men lie
351,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,So thick the earth upon.
352,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
353,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"In gore lay thick both men and steeds,"
354,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Dear friends were parted there;
355,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"All did not laugh the feast who sought,"
356,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Too hot they found the fare.
357,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
358,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Now tamer grown, the Berner Jutt"
359,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Thought thus himself within:
360,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Of us a hundred scarce remain,"
361,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,We cannot hope to win.”
362,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
363,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"Then took he to his heels and ran,"
364,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Not often back looked he;
365,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"To say good night forgot Swerting quite,"
366,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"For Bern, for Bern they flee."
367,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
368,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Then Diderik turned him with a shout
369,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,That shook the vaulted skies:
370,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"“Bern, Bern’s the place for us, I guess,"
371,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,For here no refuge lies!”
372,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
373,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Then answered ’neath the green hill’s side
374,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,The son of Verland keen:
375,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,“Ye and your host will little boast
376,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Ye have in Denmark been.”
377,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
378,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Full eighteen thousand knights were they
379,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,When out they marched from Bern;
380,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,Wounded and worn but seventy-five
381,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,"With drooping crests, return."
382,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
383,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
384,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
385,DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE,
386,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN
387,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
388,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
389,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Burman in the mountain holds,"
390,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Makes his shield shine brightly there;
391,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"A message he sends to Iceland’s King,"
392,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,For he has a daughter fair.
393,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
394,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Hear, good King of Iceland, hear,"
395,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Hear what now I say to thee:
396,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Give to me thy daughter fair,"
397,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And divide thy land with me.
398,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
399,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Either yield thy daughter fair,"
400,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"And divide with me thy land,"
401,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Or the warrior good prepare
402,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Who in fight can me withstand.”
403,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
404,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“I have daughter none but one,"
405,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Damsel Gloriant her they call;
406,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"To King Carvel she’s betrothed,"
407,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And in him my trust is all.
408,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
409,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,“I have given her to a King
410,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And King Carvel hight is he;
411,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"If he fail to defend the maid,"
412,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Then thy booty she shall be.”
413,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
414,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"’Twas the King of Iceland good,"
415,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,To his daughter’s bower he goes;
416,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And the Damsel Gloriant
417,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,To receive him gently rose.
418,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
419,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Hear, all dearest daughter mine,"
420,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,For I bring thee tidings new;
421,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Burman in the mountain holds,"
422,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,He would win thee and doth woo.
423,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
424,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Burman is a kempion dour,"
425,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And of jesting nought he knows;
426,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"He will surely have thee soon,"
427,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,If no warrior him oppose.”
428,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
429,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"It was Damsel Gloriant,"
430,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Silent would no longer stand:
431,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,“In our tower a prisoner is
432,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Who will Burman take in hand.”
433,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
434,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"It was Damsel Gloriant,"
435,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Her blue mantle o’er her threw;
436,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Swiftly to the prison tower,"
437,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Where the prisoners lay she flew.
438,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
439,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"It was Damsel Gloriant,"
440,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,’Bove the prisoners all she cried:
441,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Hear thou, Olger good, the Dane,"
442,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Have thy legs yet power to stride?
443,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
444,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Art thou living, Olger Dane?"
445,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I have something to impart;
446,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"There is a trold for me that lusts,"
447,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And that trold is Burman swart.
448,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
449,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“I’ll not wed the filthy guest,"
450,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I’m betrothed to Christian knight;
451,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I to thee will subject be
452,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,If thou conquer him in fight.”
453,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
454,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Here I’ve lain for fifteen years,"
455,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,All in chains and bondage hard;
456,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Blessings on thee, Gloriant,"
457,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,That to me thou hast repaired.
458,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
459,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Here for fifteen years I’ve lain,"
460,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Borne fierce hunger-pangs, and thirst;"
461,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I’m not able now to wage
462,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Fight as I was able erst.”
463,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
464,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Hear thou me, good Olger Dane,"
465,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Save me from my peril, save;"
466,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Ere I take the ugly trold
467,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I would fling me in my grave.
468,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
469,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Burman is fierce, his horse is wild"
470,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"I to thee will tell forsooth,"
471,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I have heard and been assured
472,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,That he bites with wolfish tooth.
473,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
474,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Nothing, nothing will he eat"
475,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,But the flesh of Christian men;
476,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"And nothing, nothing, will he drink"
477,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,But human blood mixt up with bane.”
478,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
479,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Thy father means a gallant man,"
480,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,King Carvel to share thy bed;
481,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Can he not hold thee from the trold,"
482,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,That thou unto me hast sped?
483,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
484,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Blessings on thee, Gloriant,"
485,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"That thou didst upon me think,"
486,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,With Burman I will break a lance
487,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,If thou give me good meat and drink.
488,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
489,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Canst thou procure my horse again,"
490,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,My good sword and hauberk tried?
491,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Then for thy sake it will be,"
492,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I a course with him will ride.
493,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
494,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Carvel is my stall-brother true,"
495,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,To his ears ’twill doubtless come;
496,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Rather would I lose my life
497,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Than the fiend should bear thee home.”
498,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
499,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,“The best food which thou shalt choose
500,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,I for thee will straight provide;
501,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"And I will give thee thy steed again,"
502,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Which thou lovest best to ride.
503,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
504,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,“I will give thee the strongest sword
505,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,E’er that armed a warrior’s side;
506,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Give thee too a faulchion hard,"
507,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Well thereon thou may’st confide.”
508,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
509,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Olger from the tower they took,"
510,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Garments for him have they wrought;
511,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"They sat him highest at the board,"
512,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And rich meats for him they brought.
513,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
514,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Burman riding came to court,"
515,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Thought to bear the maid away;
516,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Olger the Dane against him rode,"
517,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And soon found him rougher play.
518,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
519,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"For two days they stoutly fought,"
520,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,As the third towards evening drew
521,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Down upon a stone they sat,"
522,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,They their strength would there renew.
523,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
524,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Then the valiant Burman kemp,"
525,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,To the Danish Olger said:
526,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Quarter I will grant, if thou"
527,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Wilt believe in Mahommed.”
528,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
529,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Little could brook that, Olger the Dane,"
530,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,On his foe fierce looks he bent:
531,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,“When thou dwell in blackest hell
532,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Say by Olger thou wast sent.”
533,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
534,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Up then leapt the kempions twain,"
535,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,’Gainst each other rode anew;
536,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Then asunder went their helms,"
537,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,And afar their faulchions flew.
538,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
539,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"They fought so long, they fought so hard,"
540,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,That their strength was well-nigh flown;
541,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"Slain at length was Burman Kemp,"
542,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Dead to earth fell Burman down.
543,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,
544,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Olger to the Damsel rode:
545,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,"“Thou mayst take thy plighted knight,"
546,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,For I have with my good sword
547,OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN,Slain the foul and poisonous sprite.”
