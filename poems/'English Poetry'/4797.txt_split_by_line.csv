38,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
39,PREFACE.,
40,PREFACE.,"This edition of his ""Poetical Works"" contains all Shelley's"
41,PREFACE.,ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared
42,PREFACE.,in print. In preparing the volume I have worked as far as possible on
43,PREFACE.,the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary
44,PREFACE.,textual authority. I have not been content to reprint Mrs. Shelley's
45,PREFACE.,"recension of 1839, or that of any subsequent editor of the ""Poems""."
46,PREFACE.,The present text is the result of a fresh collation of the early
47,PREFACE.,editions; and in every material instance of departure from the wording
48,PREFACE.,of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a
49,PREFACE.,"footnote. Again, wherever--as in the case of ""Julian and"
50,PREFACE.,"Maddalo""--there has appeared to be good reason for superseding the"
51,PREFACE.,"authority of the editio princeps, the fact is announced, and the"
52,PREFACE.,"substituted exemplar indicated, in the Prefatory Note. in the case of"
53,PREFACE.,a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the
54,PREFACE.,alternative text or texts will be found at the [end] of the [relevant
55,PREFACE.,work]; but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to
56,PREFACE.,"be a variorum edition, in the proper sense of the term--the textual"
57,PREFACE.,apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive. Thus I have not thought it
58,PREFACE.,necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical
59,PREFACE.,"correction introduced by Mrs. Shelley, apparently on her own"
60,PREFACE.,"authority, into the texts of 1839; nor has it come within the scheme"
61,PREFACE.,of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or
62,PREFACE.,"proposed by Rossetti and others in recent times. But it is hoped that,"
63,PREFACE.,"up to and including the editions of 1839 at least, no important"
64,PREFACE.,variation of the text has been overlooked. Whenever a reading has been
65,PREFACE.,"adopted on manuscript authority, a reference to the particular source"
66,PREFACE.,has been added below.
67,PREFACE.,
68,PREFACE.,I have been chary of gratuitous interference with the punctuation of
69,PREFACE.,"the manuscripts and early editions; in this direction, however, some"
70,PREFACE.,"revision was indispensable. Even in his most carefully finished ""fair"
71,PREFACE.,"copy"" Shelley under-punctuates (Thus in the exquisite autograph ""Hunt"
72,PREFACE.,"MS."" of ""Julian and Maddalo"", Mr. Buxton Forman, the most conservative"
73,PREFACE.,"of editors, finds it necessary to supplement Shelley's punctuation in"
74,PREFACE.,"no fewer than ninety-four places.), and sometimes punctuates"
75,PREFACE.,capriciously. In the very act of transcribing his mind was apt to
76,PREFACE.,stray from the work in hand to higher things; he would lose himself in
77,PREFACE.,contemplating those airy abstractions and lofty visions of which alone
78,PREFACE.,"he greatly cared to sing, to the neglect and detriment of the merely"
79,PREFACE.,external and formal element of his song. Shelley recked little of the
80,PREFACE.,jots and tittles of literary craftsmanship; he committed many a small
81,PREFACE.,"sin against the rules of grammar, and certainly paid but a halting"
82,PREFACE.,attention to the nice distinctions of punctuation. Thus in the early
83,PREFACE.,editions a comma occasionally plays the part of a semicolon; colons
84,PREFACE.,and semicolons seem to be employed interchangeably; a semicolon almost
85,PREFACE.,"invariably appears where nowadays we should employ the dash; and,"
86,PREFACE.,"lastly, the dash itself becomes a point of all work, replacing"
87,PREFACE.,"indifferently commas, colons, semicolons or periods. Inadequate and"
88,PREFACE.,"sometimes haphazard as it is, however, Shelley's punctuation, so far"
89,PREFACE.,"as it goes, is of great value as an index to his metrical, or at"
90,PREFACE.,"times, it may be, to his rhetorical intention--for, in Shelley's"
91,PREFACE.,"hands, punctuation serves rather to mark the rhythmical pause and"
92,PREFACE.,"onflow of the verse, or to secure some declamatory effect, than to"
93,PREFACE.,indicate the structure or elucidate the sense. For this reason the
94,PREFACE.,"original pointing has been retained, save where it tends to obscure or"
95,PREFACE.,pervert the poet's meaning. Amongst the Editor's Notes at the end of
96,PREFACE.,the Volume 3 the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in
97,PREFACE.,"the longer poems, by means of which the supplementary points now added"
98,PREFACE.,"may be identified, and the original points, which in this edition have"
99,PREFACE.,"been deleted or else replaced by others, ascertained, in the order of"
100,PREFACE.,their occurrence. In the use of capitals Shelley's practice has been
101,PREFACE.,"followed, while an attempt has been made to reduce the number of his"
102,PREFACE.,inconsistencies in this regard.
103,PREFACE.,
104,PREFACE.,To have reproduced the spelling of the manuscripts would only have
105,PREFACE.,served to divert attention from Shelley's poetry to my own ingenuity
106,PREFACE.,in disgusting the reader according to the rules of editorial
107,PREFACE.,"punctilio. (I adapt a phrase or two from the preface to ""The Revolt of"
108,PREFACE.,"Islam"".) Shelley was neither very accurate, nor always consistent, in"
109,PREFACE.,"his spelling. He was, to say the truth, indifferent about all such"
110,PREFACE.,"matters: indeed, to one absorbed in the spectacle of a world"
111,PREFACE.,"travailing for lack of the gospel of ""Political Justice"", the study of"
112,PREFACE.,orthographical niceties must have seemed an occupation for Bedlamites.
113,PREFACE.,"Again--as a distinguished critic and editor of Shelley, Professor"
114,PREFACE.,"Dowden, aptly observes in this connexion--'a great poet is not of an"
115,PREFACE.,"age, but for all time.' Irregular or antiquated forms such as"
116,PREFACE.,"'recieve,' 'sacrifize,' 'tyger,' 'gulph,' 'desart,' 'falshood,' and"
117,PREFACE.,"the like, can only serve to distract the reader's attention, and mar"
118,PREFACE.,his enjoyment of the verse. Accordingly Shelley's eccentricities in
119,PREFACE.,"this kind have been discarded, and his spelling reversed in accordance"
120,PREFACE.,"with modern usage. All weak preterite-forms, whether indicatives or"
121,PREFACE.,"participles, have been printed with ""ed"" rather than ""t"", participial"
122,PREFACE.,"adjectives and substantives, such as 'past,' alone excepted. In the"
123,PREFACE.,"case of 'leap,' which has two preterite-forms, both employed by"
124,PREFACE.,"Shelley (See for an example of the longer form, the ""Hymn to Mercury"","
125,PREFACE.,"18 5, where 'leaped' rhymes with 'heaped' (line 1). The shorter form,"
126,PREFACE.,"rhyming to 'wept,' 'adapt,' etc., occurs more frequently.)--one with"
127,PREFACE.,"the long vowel of the present-form, the other with a vowel-change (Of"
128,PREFACE.,"course, wherever this vowel-shortening takes place, whether indicated"
129,PREFACE.,"by a corresponding change in the spelling or not, ""t"", not ""ed"" is"
130,PREFACE.,"properly used--'cleave,' 'cleft,'; 'deal,' 'dealt'; etc. The forms"
131,PREFACE.,"discarded under the general rule laid down above are such as 'wrackt,'"
132,PREFACE.,"'prankt,' 'snatcht,' 'kist,' 'opprest,' etc.) like that of 'crept'"
133,PREFACE.,"from 'creep'--I have not hesitated to print the longer form 'leaped,'"
134,PREFACE.,"and the shorter (after Mr. Henry Sweet's example) 'lept,' in order"
135,PREFACE.,clearly to indicate the pronunciation intended by Shelley. In the
136,PREFACE.,"editions the two vowel-sounds are confounded under the one spelling,"
137,PREFACE.,"'leapt.' In a few cases Shelley's spelling, though unusual or"
138,PREFACE.,"obsolete, has been retained. Thus in 'aethereal,' 'paean,' and one or"
139,PREFACE.,"two more words the ""ae"" will be found, and 'airy' still appears as"
140,PREFACE.,'aery'. Shelley seems to have uniformly written 'lightening': here the
141,PREFACE.,word is so printed whenever it is employed as a trisyllable; elsewhere
142,PREFACE.,the ordinary spelling has been adopted. (Not a little has been written
143,PREFACE.,"about 'uprest' (""Revolt of Islam"", 3 21 5), which has been described"
144,PREFACE.,as a nonce-word deliberately coined by Shelley 'on no better warrant
145,PREFACE.,than the exigency of the rhyme.' There can be little doubt that
146,PREFACE.,'uprest' is simply an overlooked misprint for 'uprist'--not by any
147,PREFACE.,"means a nonce-word, but a genuine English verbal substantive of"
148,PREFACE.,"regular formation, familiar to many from its employment by Chaucer."
149,PREFACE.,"True, the corresponding rhyme-words in the passage above referred to"
150,PREFACE.,"are 'nest,' 'possessed,' 'breast'; but a laxity such as"
151,PREFACE.,'nest'--'uprist' is quite in Shelley's manner. Thus in this very poem
152,PREFACE.,"we find 'midst'--'shed'st' (6 16), 'mist'--'rest'--'blest' (5 58),"
153,PREFACE.,'loveliest'--'mist'--kissed'--'dressed' (5 53). Shelley may have first
154,PREFACE.,"seen the word in ""The Ancient Mariner""; but he employs it more"
155,PREFACE.,"correctly than Coleridge, who seems to have mistaken it for a"
156,PREFACE.,preterite-form (='uprose') whereas in truth it serves either as the
157,PREFACE.,"third person singular of the present (='upriseth'), or, as here, for"
158,PREFACE.,the verbal substantive (='uprising').
159,PREFACE.,
160,PREFACE.,"The editor of Shelley to-day enters upon a goodly heritage, the"
161,PREFACE.,accumulated gains of a series of distinguished predecessors. Mrs.
162,PREFACE.,"Shelley's two editions of 1839 form the nucleus of the present volume,"
163,PREFACE.,and her notes are here reprinted in full; but the arrangement of the
164,PREFACE.,poems differs to some extent from that followed by her--chiefly in
165,PREFACE.,"respect of ""Queen Mab"", which is here placed at the head of the"
166,PREFACE.,"""Juvenilia"", instead of at the forefront of the poems of Shelley's"
167,PREFACE.,"maturity. In 1862 a slender volume of poems and fragments, entitled"
168,PREFACE.,"""Relics of Shelley"", was published by Dr. Richard Garnett, C.B.--a"
169,PREFACE.,precious sheaf gleaned from the manuscripts preserved at Boscombe
170,PREFACE.,"Manor. The ""Relics"" constitute a salvage second only in value to the"
171,PREFACE.,"""Posthumous Poems"" of 1824. To the growing mass of Shelley's verse yet"
172,PREFACE.,"more material was added in 1870 by Mr. William Michael Rossetti, who"
173,PREFACE.,"edited for Moxon the ""Complete Poetical Works"" published in that year."
174,PREFACE.,To him we owe in particular a revised and greatly enlarged version of
175,PREFACE.,"the fragmentary drama of ""Charles I"". But though not seldom successful"
176,PREFACE.,"in restoring the text, Mr. Rossetti pushed revision beyond the bounds"
177,PREFACE.,"of prudence, freely correcting grammatical errors, rectifying small"
178,PREFACE.,"inconsistencies in the sense, and too lightly adopting conjectural"
179,PREFACE.,emendations on the grounds of rhyme or metre. In the course of an
180,PREFACE.,"article published in the ""Westminster Review"" for July, 1870, Miss"
181,PREFACE.,"Mathilde Blind, with the aid of material furnished by Dr. Garnett,"
182,PREFACE.,"'was enabled,' in the words of Mr. Buxton Forman, 'to supply"
183,PREFACE.,"omissions, make authoritative emendations, and controvert erroneous"
184,PREFACE.,changes' in Mr. Rossetti's work; and in the more cautiously edited
185,PREFACE.,"text of his later edition, published by Moxon in 1878, may be traced"
186,PREFACE.,the influence of her strictures.
187,PREFACE.,
188,PREFACE.,Six years later appeared a variorum edition in which for the first
189,PREFACE.,"time Shelley's text was edited with scientific exactness of method,"
190,PREFACE.,and with a due respect for the authority of the original editions. It
191,PREFACE.,would be difficult indeed to over-estimate the gains which have
192,PREFACE.,accrued to the lovers of Shelley from the strenuous labours of Mr.
193,PREFACE.,"Harry Buxton Forman, C.B. He too has enlarged the body of Shelley's"
194,PREFACE.,"poetry (Mr. Forman's most notable addition is the second part of ""The"
195,PREFACE.,"Daemon of the World"", which he printed privately in 1876, and included"
196,PREFACE.,"in his Library Edition of the ""Poetical Works"" published in the same"
197,PREFACE.,"year. See the ""List of Editions"", etc. at the end of Volume 3.); but,"
198,PREFACE.,"important as his editions undoubtedly are, it may safely be affirmed"
199,PREFACE.,that his services in this direction constitute the least part of what
200,PREFACE.,we owe him. He has vindicated the authenticity of the text in many
201,PREFACE.,"places, while in many others he has succeeded, with the aid of"
202,PREFACE.,"manuscripts, in restoring it. His untiring industry in research, his"
203,PREFACE.,"wide bibliographical knowledge and experience, above all, his"
204,PREFACE.,"accuracy, as invariable as it is minute, have combined to make him, in"
205,PREFACE.,"the words of Professor Dowden, 'our chief living authority on all that"
206,PREFACE.,relates to Shelley's writings.' His name stands securely linked for
207,PREFACE.,"all time to Shelley's by a long series of notable words, including"
208,PREFACE.,"three successive editions (1876, 1882, 1892) of the Poems, an edition"
209,PREFACE.,"of the Prose Remains, as well as many minor publications--a"
210,PREFACE.,"Bibliography (""The Shelley Library"", 1886)and several Facsimile"
211,PREFACE.,"Reprints of the early issues, edited for the Shelley Society."
212,PREFACE.,
213,PREFACE.,"To Professor Dowden, whose authoritative Biography of the poet,"
214,PREFACE.,"published in 1886, was followed in 1890 by an edition of the Poems"
215,PREFACE.,"(Macmillans), is due the addition of several pieces belonging to the"
216,PREFACE.,"juvenile period, incorporated by him in the pages of the ""Life of"
217,PREFACE.,"Shelley"". Professor Dowden has also been enabled, with the aid of the"
218,PREFACE.,"manuscripts placed in his hands, to correct the text of the"
219,PREFACE.,"""Juvenilia"" in many places. In 1893 Professor George E. Woodberry"
220,PREFACE.,"edited a ""Centenary Edition of the Complete Poetical Works"", in which,"
221,PREFACE.,"to quote his own words, an attempt is made 'to summarize the labours"
222,PREFACE.,"of more than half a century on Shelley's text, and on his biography so"
223,PREFACE.,far as the biography is bound up with the text.' In this Centenary
224,PREFACE.,edition the textual variations found in the Harvard College
225,PREFACE.,"manuscripts, as well as those in the manuscripts belonging to Mr."
226,PREFACE.,"Frederickson of Brooklyn, are fully recorded. Professor Woodberry's"
227,PREFACE.,"text is conservative on the whole, but his revision of the punctuation"
228,PREFACE.,"is drastic, and occasionally sacrifices melody to perspicuity."
229,PREFACE.,
230,PREFACE.,"In 1903 Mr. C.D. Locock published, in a quarto volume of seventy-five"
231,PREFACE.,"pages, the fruits of a careful scrutiny of the Shelley manuscripts now"
232,PREFACE.,lodged in the Bodleian Library. Mr. Locock succeeded in recovering
233,PREFACE.,several inedited fragments of verse and prose. Amongst the poems
234,PREFACE.,"chiefly concerned in the results of his ""Examination"" may be named"
235,PREFACE.,"""Marenghi"", ""Prince Athanase"", ""The Witch of Atlas"", ""To Constantia"","
236,PREFACE.,"the ""Ode to Naples"", and (last, not least) ""Prometheus Unbound"". Full"
237,PREFACE.,"use has been made in this edition of Mr. Locock's collations, and the"
238,PREFACE.,fragments recovered and printed by him are included in the text.
239,PREFACE.,"Variants derived from the Bodleian manuscripts are marked ""B."" in the"
240,PREFACE.,footnotes.
241,PREFACE.,
242,PREFACE.,"On the state of the text generally, and the various quarters in which"
243,PREFACE.,"it lies open to conjectural emendation, I cannot do better than quote"
244,PREFACE.,"the following succinct and luminous account from a ""Causerie"" on the"
245,PREFACE.,"Shelley manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, contributed by Dr."
246,PREFACE.,"Richard Garnett, C.B., to the columns of ""The Speaker"" of December 19,"
247,PREFACE.,1903:--
248,PREFACE.,
249,PREFACE.,"'From the textual point of view, Shelley's works may be divided into"
250,PREFACE.,three classes--those published in his lifetime under his own
251,PREFACE.,"direction; those also published in his lifetime, but in his absence"
252,PREFACE.,from the press; and those published after his death. The first class
253,PREFACE.,"includes ""Queen Mab"", ""The Revolt of Islam"", and ""Alastor"" with its"
254,PREFACE.,"appendages, published in England before his final departure for the"
255,PREFACE.,"continent; and ""The Cenci"" and ""Adonais"", printed under his own eye at"
256,PREFACE.,Leghorn and Pisa respectively. Except for some provoking but
257,PREFACE.,"corrigible misprints in ""The Revolt of Islam"" and one crucial passage"
258,PREFACE.,"in ""Alastor"", these poems afford little material for conjectural"
259,PREFACE.,emendation; for the Alexandrines now and then left in the middle of
260,PREFACE.,"stanzas in ""The Revolt of Islam"" must remain untouched, as proceeding"
261,PREFACE.,not from the printer's carelessness but the author's. The second
262,PREFACE.,"class, poems printed during Shelley's lifetime, but not under his"
263,PREFACE.,"immediate inspection, comprise ""Prometheus Unbound"" and ""Rosalind and"
264,PREFACE.,"Helen"", together with the pieces which accompanied them,"
265,PREFACE.,"""Epipsychidion"", ""Hellas"", and ""Swellfoot the Tyrant"". The correction"
266,PREFACE.,"of the most important of these, the ""Prometheus"", was the least"
267,PREFACE.,"satisfactory. Shelley, though speaking plainly to the publisher,"
268,PREFACE.,rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to
269,PREFACE.,"Gisborne, the corrector, but there is a pretty clear hint when on a"
270,PREFACE.,"subsequent occasion he says to him, ""I have received 'Hellas', which"
271,PREFACE.,"is prettily printed, and with fewer mistakes than any poem I ever"
272,PREFACE.,"published."" This also was probably not without influence on his"
273,PREFACE.,"determination to have ""The Cenci"" and ""Adonais"" printed in Italy...Of"
274,PREFACE.,the third class of Shelley's writings--those which were first
275,PREFACE.,published after his death--sufficient facsimiles have been published
276,PREFACE.,to prove that Trelawny's graphic description of the chaotic state of
277,PREFACE.,most of them was really in no respect exaggerated...The difficulty is
278,PREFACE.,"much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive,"
279,PREFACE.,"but literally disiecti membra poetae, scattered through various"
280,PREFACE.,notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering.
281,PREFACE.,"The editors of the Posthumous Poems, moreover, though diligent"
282,PREFACE.,"according to their light, were neither endowed with remarkable acumen"
283,PREFACE.,nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full
284,PREFACE.,"intelligence of so erudite a poet as Shelley, hence the perpetration"
285,PREFACE.,"of numerous mistakes. Some few of the manuscripts, indeed, such as"
286,PREFACE.,"those of ""The Witch of Atlas"", ""Julian and Maddalo"", and the ""Lines at"
287,PREFACE.,"Naples"", were beautifully written out for the press in Shelley's best"
288,PREFACE.,"hand, but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of"
289,PREFACE.,"transcription, with disastrous results in several instances. An entire"
290,PREFACE.,"line dropped out of the ""Lines at Naples"", and although ""Julian and"
291,PREFACE.,"Maddalo"" was extant in more than one very clear copy, the printed text"
292,PREFACE.,"had several such sense-destroying errors as ""least"" for ""lead""."
293,PREFACE.,
294,PREFACE.,'The corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of
295,PREFACE.,"numerous correctors, who have suggested many acute and convincing"
296,PREFACE.,"emendations, and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has"
297,PREFACE.,proved untenable. It should be needless to remark that success has in
298,PREFACE.,general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the
299,PREFACE.,"manuscripts, which have only of late become generally available. If"
300,PREFACE.,Shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his
301,PREFACE.,"text, he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his"
302,PREFACE.,"manuscripts. These have not, as regards a fair proportion, been"
303,PREFACE.,"destroyed or dispersed at auctions, but were protected from either"
304,PREFACE.,fate by their very character as confused memoranda. As such they
305,PREFACE.,"remained in the possession of Shelley's widow, and passed from her to"
306,PREFACE.,"her son and daughter-in-law. After Sir Percy Shelley's death, Lady"
307,PREFACE.,Shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to Shelley
308,PREFACE.,"at University College, Oxford, to present [certain of] the manuscripts"
309,PREFACE.,"to the Bodleian Library, and verse and sculpture form an imperishable"
310,PREFACE.,memorial of his connection with the University where his residence was
311,PREFACE.,so brief and troubled.' (Dr. Garnett proceeds:--'The most important of
312,PREFACE.,"the Bodleian manuscripts is that of ""Prometheus Unbound"", which, says"
313,PREFACE.,"Mr. Locock, has the appearance of being an intermediate draft, and"
314,PREFACE.,also the first copy made. This should confer considerable authority on
315,PREFACE.,"its variations from the accepted text, as this appears to have been"
316,PREFACE.,"printed from a copy not made by Shelley himself. ""My 'Prometheus',"" he"
317,PREFACE.,"writes to Ollier on September 6, 1819, ""is now being transcribed,"" an"
318,PREFACE.,expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the
319,PREFACE.,copyist. He wished the proofs to be sent to him in Italy for
320,PREFACE.,"correction, but to this Ollier objected, and on May 14, 1820, Shelley"
321,PREFACE.,"signifies his acquiescence, adding, however, ""In this case I shall"
322,PREFACE.,repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press; Mr.
323,PREFACE.,"Gisborne will revise it; he heard it recited, and will therefore more"
324,PREFACE.,"readily seize any error."" This confidence in the accuracy of"
325,PREFACE.,Gisborne's verbal memory is touching! From a letter to Gisborne on May
326,PREFACE.,"26 following it appears that the offer to correct came from him, and"
327,PREFACE.,"that Shelley sent him ""two little papers of corrections and"
328,PREFACE.,"additions,"" which were probably made use of, or the fact would have"
329,PREFACE.,been made known. In the case of additions this may satisfactorily
330,PREFACE.,"account for apparent omissions in the Bodleian manuscript. Gisborne,"
331,PREFACE.,"after all, did not prove fully up to the mark. ""It is to be"
332,PREFACE.,"regretted,"" writes Shelley to Ollier on November 20, ""that the errors"
333,PREFACE.,"of the press are so numerous,"" adding, ""I shall send you the list of"
334,PREFACE.,"errata in a day or two."" This was probably ""the list of errata written"
335,PREFACE.,"by Shelley himself,"" from which Mrs. Shelley corrected the edition of"
336,PREFACE.,1839.')
337,PREFACE.,
338,PREFACE.,"In placing ""Queen Mab"" at the head of the ""Juvenilia"" I have followed"
339,PREFACE.,the arrangement adopted by Mr. Buxton Forman in his Library Edition of
340,PREFACE.,"1876. I have excluded ""The Wandering Jew"", having failed to satisfy"
341,PREFACE.,"myself of the sufficiency of the grounds on which, in certain"
342,PREFACE.,"quarters, it is accepted as the work of Shelley. The shorter fragments"
343,PREFACE.,"are printed, as in Professor Dowden's edition of 1890, along with the"
344,PREFACE.,"miscellaneous poems of the years to which they severally belong, under"
345,PREFACE.,"titles which are sometimes borrowed from Mr. Buxton Forman, sometimes"
346,PREFACE.,"of my own choosing. I have added a few brief Editor's Notes, mainly on"
347,PREFACE.,"textual questions, at the end of the book. Of the poverty of my work"
348,PREFACE.,in this direction I am painfully aware; but in the present edition the
349,PREFACE.,"ordinary reader will, it is hoped, find an authentic, complete, and"
350,PREFACE.,"accurately printed text, and, if this be so, the principal end and aim"
351,PREFACE.,of the OXFORD SHELLEY will have been attained.
352,PREFACE.,
353,PREFACE.,I desire cordially to acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. H. Buxton

357,PREFACE.,"from Mr. Buxton Forman's various editions, reprints and other"
358,PREFACE.,publications--especially from the monumental Library Edition of 1876.
359,PREFACE.,"Acknowledgements are also due to the poet's grandson, Charles E.J."

394,PREFACE BY MRS. SHELLEY,
395,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839."
396,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
397,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",Obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with a perfect
398,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","edition of Shelley's Poems. These being at last happily removed, I"
399,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","hasten to fulfil an important duty,--that of giving the productions of"
400,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","a sublime genius to the world, with all the correctness possible, and"
401,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","of, at the same time, detailing the history of those productions, as"
402,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","they sprang, living and warm, from his heart and brain. I abstain from"
403,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","any remark on the occurrences of his private life, except inasmuch as"
404,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry. This is not
405,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the time to relate the truth; and I should reject any colouring of the
406,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",truth. No account of these events has ever been given at all
407,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","approaching reality in their details, either as regards himself or"
408,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",others; nor shall I further allude to them than to remark that the
409,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as Shelley,"
410,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","may, as far as he only is concerned, be fearlessly avowed by those who"
411,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","loved him, in the firm conviction that, were they judged impartially,"
412,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of
413,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",any contemporary. Whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation
414,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","among his fellows, since they prove him to be human; without them, the"
415,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something
416,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",divine.
417,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
418,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",The qualities that struck any one newly introduced to Shelley
419,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","were,--First, a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his"
420,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy. The other, the"
421,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human
422,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",happiness and improvement; and the fervent eloquence with which he
423,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",discussed such subjects. His conversation was marked by its happy
424,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","abundance, and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic"
425,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",ideas and philosophical notions. To defecate life of its misery and
426,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",its evil was the ruling passion of his soul; he dedicated to it every
427,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","power of his mind, every pulsation of his heart. He looked on"
428,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of
429,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",mankind; and thus any new-sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an
430,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any
431,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",personal advantage. Those who have never experienced the workings of
432,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this; and
433,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising
434,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","around, since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the"
435,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago, nor the"
436,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",persecutions to which they were exposed. He had been from youth the
437,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the French
438,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",Revolution; and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his
439,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","views, it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive, as impetuous,"
440,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","and as generous as his, should put its whole force into the attempt to"
441,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had
442,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",himself suffered. Many advantages attended his birth; he spurned them
443,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",all when balanced with what he considered his duties. He was generous
444,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","to imprudence, devoted to heroism."
445,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
446,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",These characteristics breathe throughout his poetry. The struggle for
447,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","human weal; the resolution firm to martyrdom; the impetuous pursuit,"
448,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the glad triumph in good; the determination not to despair;--such were
449,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with
450,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","most complacency, as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim."
451,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
452,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","In addition to these, his poems may be divided into two classes,--the"
453,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","purely imaginative, and those which sprang from the emotions of his"
454,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","heart. Among the former may be classed the ""Witch of Atlas"","
455,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","""Adonais"", and his latest composition, left imperfect, the ""Triumph of"
456,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","Life"". In the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his"
457,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","fancy, and luxuriated in every idea as it rose; in all there is that"
458,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception
459,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","of life--a clinging to the subtler inner spirit, rather than to the"
460,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",outward form--a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and
461,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",perception.
462,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
463,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","The second class is, of course, the more popular, as appealing at once"
464,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",to emotions common to us all; some of these rest on the passion of
465,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",love; others on grief and despondency; others on the sentiments
466,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","inspired by natural objects. Shelley's conception of love was exalted,"
467,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","absorbing, allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature, and"
468,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",warmed by earnest passion; such it appears when he gave it a voice in
469,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","verse. Yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings, except"
470,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",when highly idealized; and many of his more beautiful effusions he had
471,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","cast aside unfinished, and they were never seen by me till after I had"
472,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","lost him. Others, as for instance ""Rosalind and Helen"" and ""Lines"
473,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","written among the Euganean Hills"", I found among his papers by chance;"
474,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","and with some difficulty urged him to complete them. There are others,"
475,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","such as the ""Ode to the Skylark and The Cloud"", which, in the opinion"
476,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","of many critics, bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his"
477,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",productions. They were written as his mind prompted: listening to the
478,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","carolling of the bird, aloft in the azure sky of Italy; or marking the"
479,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","cloud as it sped across the heavens, while he floated in his boat on"
480,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the Thames.
481,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
482,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",No poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration.
483,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",His extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his
484,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",intellectual pursuits; and rendered his mind keenly alive to every
485,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","perception of outward objects, as well as to his internal sensations."
486,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","Such a gift is, among the sad vicissitudes of human life, the"
487,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","disappointments we meet, and the galling sense of our own mistakes and"
488,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","errors, fraught with pain; to escape from such, he delivered up his"
489,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","soul to poetry, and felt happy when he sheltered himself, from the"
490,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","influence of human sympathies, in the wildest regions of fancy. His"
491,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","imagination has been termed too brilliant, his thoughts too subtle. He"
492,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",loved to idealize reality; and this is a taste shared by few. We are
493,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions, for this"
494,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",gratifies our vanity; but few of us understand or sympathize with the
495,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty, and adoration of"
496,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","abstract good, the to agathon kai to kalon of the Socratic"
497,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","philosophers, with our sympathies with our kind. In this, Shelley"
498,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",resembled Plato; both taking more delight in the abstract and the
499,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",ideal than in the special and tangible. This did not result from
500,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",imitation; for it was not till Shelley resided in Italy that he made
501,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","Plato his study. He then translated his ""Symposium"" and his ""Ion""; and"
502,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the English language boasts of no more brilliant composition than
503,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",Plato's Praise of Love translated by Shelley. To return to his own
504,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","poetry. The luxury of imagination, which sought nothing beyond itself"
505,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","(as a child burdens itself with spring flowers, thinking of no use"
506,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","beyond the enjoyment of gathering them), often showed itself in his"
507,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",verses: they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance
508,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",to his own; and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share
509,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the same fate. The metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what
510,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","he has written was, indeed, the portion of his works to which, apart"
511,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what
512,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","he considered the true and good, he was himself particularly attached."
513,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","There is much, however, that speaks to the many. When he would consent"
514,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","to dismiss these huntings after the obscure (which, entwined with his"
515,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","nature as they were, he did with difficulty), no poet ever expressed"
516,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","in sweeter, more heart-reaching, or more passionate verse, the gentler"
517,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",or more forcible emotions of the soul.
518,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
519,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","A wise friend once wrote to Shelley: 'You are still very young, and in"
520,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that
521,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","you are so.' It is seldom that the young know what youth is, till they"
522,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",have got beyond its period; and time was not given him to attain this
523,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",knowledge. It must be remembered that there is the stamp of such
524,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",inexperience on all he wrote; he had not completed his
525,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",nine-and-twentieth year when he died. The calm of middle life did not
526,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by
527,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",the vehement spirit of youth. Through life also he was a martyr to
528,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","ill-health, and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of"
529,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of
530,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations. Perfectly gentle and
531,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","forbearing in manner, he suffered a good deal of internal"
532,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","irritability, or rather excitement, and his fortitude to bear was"
533,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","almost always on the stretch; and thus, during a short life, he had"
534,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is
535,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","protracted. 'If I die to-morrow,' he said, on the eve of his"
536,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","unanticipated death, 'I have lived to be older than my father.' The"
537,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily; you read his
538,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","sufferings in his attenuated frame, while you perceived the mastery he"
539,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes.
540,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
541,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","He died, and the world showed no outward sign. But his influence over"
542,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","mankind, though slow in growth, is fast augmenting; and, in the"
543,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his
544,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","country, we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles."
545,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","His spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that, though"
546,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","late, his exertions were not made in vain, and in the progress of the"
547,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",liberty he so fondly loved.
548,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
549,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","He died, and his place, among those who knew him intimately, has never"
550,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",been filled up. He walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort
551,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",and benefit--to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of
552,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","genius, to cheer it with his sympathy and love. Any one, once attached"
553,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","to Shelley, must feel all other affections, however true and fond, as"
554,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",wasted on barren soil in comparison. It is our best consolation to
555,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","know that such a pure-minded and exalted being was once among us, and"
556,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",now exists where we hope one day to join him;--although the
557,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","intolerant, in their blindness, poured down anathemas, the Spirit of"
558,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","Good, who can judge the heart, never rejected him."
559,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",
560,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",In the notes appended to the poems I have endeavoured to narrate the
561,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",origin and history of each. The loss of nearly all letters and papers
562,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect
563,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","than it would otherwise have been. I have, however, the liveliest"
564,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my
565,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","knowing him. Every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday, and"
566,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",I have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they
567,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.",go. In other respects I am indeed incompetent: but I feel the
568,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","importance of the task, and regard it as my most sacred duty. I"
569,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","endeavour to fulfil it in a manner he would himself approve; and hope,"
570,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","in this publication, to lay the first stone of a monument due to"
571,"TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION, 1839.","Shelley's genius, his sufferings, and his virtues:--"

580,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"In revising this new edition, and carefully consulting Shelley's"
581,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"scattered and confused papers, I found a few fragments which had"
582,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"hitherto escaped me, and was enabled to complete a few poems hitherto"
583,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"left unfinished. What at one time escapes the searching eye, dimmed by"
584,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"its own earnestness, becomes clear at a future period. By the aid of a"
585,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"friend, I also present some poems complete and correct which hitherto"
586,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,have been defaced by various mistakes and omissions. It was suggested
587,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"that the poem ""To the Queen of my Heart"" was falsely attributed to"
588,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"Shelley. I certainly find no trace of it among his papers; and, as"
589,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"those of his intimate friends whom I have consulted never heard of it,"

595,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,in a very different spirit from Shelley's usual compositions. They are
596,POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF 1839.,"specimens of the burlesque and fanciful; but, although they adopt a"

631,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,
632,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,The comparative solitude in which Mr. Shelley lived was the occasion
633,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,that he was personally known to few; and his fearless enthusiasm in
634,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth, the"
635,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind, was the chief"
636,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"reason why he, like other illustrious reformers, was pursued by hatred"
637,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,and calumny. No man was ever more devoted than he to the endeavour of
638,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,making those around him happy; no man ever possessed friends more
639,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,unfeignedly attached to him. The ungrateful world did not feel his
640,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"loss, and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory"
641,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,as the murderous sea above his living frame. Hereafter men will lament
642,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,that his transcendent powers of intellect were extinguished before
643,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,they had bestowed on them their choicest treasures. To his friends his
644,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"loss is irremediable: the wise, the brave, the gentle, is gone for"
645,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"ever! He is to them as a bright vision, whose radiant track, left"
646,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"behind in the memory, is worth all the realities that society can"
647,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"afford. Before the critics contradict me, let them appeal to any one"
648,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"who had ever known him. To see him was to love him: and his presence,"
649,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"like Ithuriel's spear, was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood"
650,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant
651,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,world.
652,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,
653,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"His life was spent in the contemplation of Nature, in arduous study,"
654,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,or in acts of kindness and affection. He was an elegant scholar and a
655,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"profound metaphysician; without possessing much scientific knowledge,"
656,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on
657,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"natural objects; he knew every plant by its name, and was familiar"
658,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,with the history and habits of every production of the earth; he could
659,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky; and the varied
660,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion. He made
661,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"his study and reading-room of the shadowed copse, the stream, the"
662,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"lake, and the waterfall. Ill health and continual pain preyed upon his"
663,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"powers; and the solitude in which we lived, particularly on our first"
664,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"arrival in Italy, although congenial to his feelings, must frequently"
665,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"have weighed upon his spirits; those beautiful and affecting ""Lines"
666,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"written in Dejection near Naples"" were composed at such an interval;"
667,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"but, when in health, his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an"
668,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,extraordinary degree.
669,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,
670,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,Such was his love for Nature that every page of his poetry is
671,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"associated, in the minds of his friends, with the loveliest scenes of"
672,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,the countries which he inhabited. In early life he visited the most
673,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,beautiful parts of this country and Ireland. Afterwards the Alps of
674,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"Switzerland became his inspirers. ""Prometheus Unbound"" was written"
675,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"among the deserted and flower-grown ruins of Rome; and, when he made"
676,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"his home under the Pisan hills, their roofless recesses harboured him"
677,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"as he composed the ""Witch of Atlas"", ""Adonais"", and ""Hellas"". In the"
678,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"wild but beautiful Bay of Spezzia, the winds and waves which he loved"
679,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,became his playmates. His days were chiefly spent on the water; the
680,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"management of his boat, its alterations and improvements, were his"
681,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"principal occupation. At night, when the unclouded moon shone on the"
682,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"calm sea, he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves"
683,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"that bordered it, and, sitting beneath their shelter, wrote the"
684,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"""Triumph of Life"", the last of his productions. The beauty but"
685,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"strangeness of this lonely place, the refined pleasure which he felt"
686,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"in the companionship of a few selected friends, our entire"
687,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"sequestration from the rest of the world, all contributed to render"
688,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,this period of his life one of continued enjoyment. I am convinced
689,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had
690,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"ever known: his health even rapidly improved, and he was never better"
691,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"than when I last saw him, full of spirits and joy, embark for Leghorn,"
692,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,that he might there welcome Leigh Hunt to Italy. I was to have
693,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"accompanied him; but illness confined me to my room, and thus put the"
694,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,seal on my misfortune. His vessel bore out of sight with a favourable
695,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"wind, and I remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea"
696,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,which was about to engulf him.
697,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,
698,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"He spent a week at Pisa, employed in kind offices toward his friend,"
699,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,and enjoying with keen delight the renewal of their intercourse. He
700,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"then embarked with Mr. Williams, the chosen and beloved sharer of his"
701,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"pleasures and of his fate, to return to us. We waited for them in"
702,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,vain; the sea by its restless moaning seemed to desire to inform us of
703,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,what we would not learn:--but a veil may well be drawn over such
704,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,misery. The real anguish of those moments transcended all the fictions
705,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"that the most glowing imagination ever portrayed; our seclusion, the"
706,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"savage nature of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages, and our"
707,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"immediate vicinity to the troubled sea, combined to imbue with strange"
708,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"horror our days of uncertainty. The truth was at last known,--a truth"
709,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"that made our loved and lovely Italy appear a tomb, its sky a pall."
710,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"Every heart echoed the deep lament, and my only consolation was in the"
711,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,praise and earnest love that each voice bestowed and each countenance
712,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"demonstrated for him we had lost,--not, I fondly hope, for ever; his"
713,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,unearthly and elevated nature is a pledge of the continuation of his
714,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"being, although in an altered form. Rome received his ashes; they are"
715,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"deposited beneath its weed-grown wall, and 'the world's sole monument'"
716,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,is enriched by his remains.
717,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,
718,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"I must add a few words concerning the contents of this volume. ""Julian"
719,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"and Maddalo"", the ""Witch of Atlas"", and most of the ""Translations"","
720,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"were written some years ago; and, with the exception of the ""Cyclops"","
721,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"and the Scenes from the ""Magico Prodigioso"", may be considered as"
722,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"having received the author's ultimate corrections. The ""Triumph of"
723,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"Life"" was his last work, and was left in so unfinished a state that I"
724,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,arranged it in its present form with great difficulty. All his poems
725,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume,"
726,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"and I have added a reprint of ""Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude"":"
727,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,the difficulty with which a copy can be obtained is the cause of its
728,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"republication. Many of the Miscellaneous Poems, written on the spur of"
729,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"the occasion, and never retouched, I found among his manuscript books,"
730,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"and have carefully copied. I have subjoined, whenever I have been"
731,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"able, the date of their composition."
732,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,
733,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,I do not know whether the critics will reprehend the insertion of some
734,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,of the most imperfect among them; but I frankly own that I have been
735,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,more actuated by the fear lest any monument of his genius should
736,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,escape me than the wish of presenting nothing but what was complete to
737,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,the fastidious reader. I feel secure that the lovers of Shelley's
738,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,"poetry (who know how, more than any poet of the present day, every"
739,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,line and word he wrote is instinct with peculiar beauty) will pardon
740,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,and thank me: I consecrate this volume to them.

742,TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824.,The size of this collection has prevented the insertion of any prose

1552,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
1553,PREFACE.,
1554,PREFACE.,"The poem entitled ""Alastor"" may be considered as allegorical of one of"
1555,PREFACE.,the most interesting situations of the human mind. It represents a
1556,PREFACE.,youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an
1557,PREFACE.,imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is
1558,PREFACE.,"excellent and majestic, to the contemplation of the universe. He"
1559,PREFACE.,"drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge, and is still insatiate. The"
1560,PREFACE.,magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into
1561,PREFACE.,"the frame of his conceptions, and affords to their modifications at"
1562,PREFACE.,variety not to be exhausted. so long as it is possible for his desires
1563,PREFACE.,"to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured, he is joyous,"
1564,PREFACE.,"and tranquil, and self-possessed. But the period arrives when these"
1565,PREFACE.,objects cease to suffice. His mind is at length suddenly awakened and
1566,PREFACE.,thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself. He
1567,PREFACE.,images to himself the Being whom he loves. Conversant with
1568,PREFACE.,"speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures, the vision in"
1569,PREFACE.,"which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful, or"
1570,PREFACE.,"wise, or beautiful, which the poet, the philosopher, or the lover"
1571,PREFACE.,"could depicture. The intellectual faculties, the imagination, the"
1572,PREFACE.,"functions of sense, have their respective requisitions on the sympathy"
1573,PREFACE.,of corresponding powers in other human beings. The Poet is represented
1574,PREFACE.,"as uniting these requisitions, and attaching them to a single image."
1575,PREFACE.,He seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception. Blasted by his
1576,PREFACE.,"disappointment, he descends to an untimely grave."
1577,PREFACE.,
1578,PREFACE.,The picture is not barren of instruction to actual men. The Poet's
1579,PREFACE.,self-centred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible
1580,PREFACE.,passion pursuing him to speedy ruin. But that Power which strikes the
1581,PREFACE.,"luminaries of the world with sudden darkness and extinction, by"
1582,PREFACE.,"awakening them to too exquisite a perception of its influences, dooms"
1583,PREFACE.,to a slow and poisonous decay those manner spirits that dare to abjure
1584,PREFACE.,its dominion. Their destiny is more abject and inglorious as their
1585,PREFACE.,"delinquency is more contemptible and pernicious. They who, deluded by"
1586,PREFACE.,"no generous error, instigated by no sacred thirst of doubtful"
1587,PREFACE.,"knowledge, duped by no illustrious superstition, loving nothing on"
1588,PREFACE.,"this earth, and cherishing no hopes beyond, yet keep aloof from"
1589,PREFACE.,"sympathies with their kind, rejoicing neither in human joy nor"
1590,PREFACE.,"mourning with human grief; these, and such as they, have their"
1591,PREFACE.,"apportioned curse. They languish, because none feel with them their"
1592,PREFACE.,"common nature. They are morally dead. They are neither friends, nor"
1593,PREFACE.,"lovers, nor fathers, nor citizens of the world, nor benefactors of"
1594,PREFACE.,their country. Among those who attempt to exist without human
1595,PREFACE.,"sympathy, the pure and tender-hearted perish through the intensity and"
1596,PREFACE.,"passion of their search after its communities, when the vacancy of"
1597,PREFACE.,"their spirit suddenly makes itself felt. All else, selfish, blind, and"
1598,PREFACE.,"torpid, are those unforeseeing multitudes who constitute, together"
1599,PREFACE.,"with their own, the lasting misery and loneliness of the world. Those"
1600,PREFACE.,"who love not their fellow-beings live unfruitful lives, and prepare"
1601,PREFACE.,for their old age a miserable grave.

2024,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Now shall it fall?--A wandering stream of wind,"
2025,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,"
2026,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","And, lo! with gentle motion, between banks"
2027,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream,                              _400"
2028,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark!"
2029,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar,"

2033,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers"
2034,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes,"
2035,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave
2036,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of the boat's motion marred their pensive task,"
2037,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Which naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind,                       _410"
2038,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay"

2041,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","But on his heart its solitude returned,"
2042,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid                           _415
2043,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame"
2044,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Had yet performed its ministry: it hung
2045,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud"
2046,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods"

2052,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks,"
2053,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever.                        _425"
2054,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",The meeting boughs and implicated leaves
2055,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Wove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as led"

2067,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","In rainbow and in fire, the parasites,"
2068,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around                      _440"
2069,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,"

2078,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms                   _450"
2079,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen
2080,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine,"
2081,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",A soul-dissolving odour to invite

2089,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of azure sky, darting between their chasms;"
2090,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves
2091,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Its portraiture, but some inconstant star"
2092,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,"
2093,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,                          _465"
2094,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Or gorgeous insect floating motionless,"
2095,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings"

2097,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",
2098,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld

2100,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth"
2101,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of that still fountain; as the human heart,"
2102,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,"
2103,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard
2104,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung                      _475"
2105,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel
2106,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","An unaccustomed presence, and the sound"
2107,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs
2108,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed
2109,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",To stand beside him--clothed in no bright robes                      _480
2110,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of shadowy silver or enshrining light,"
2111,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Borrowed from aught the visible world affords
2112,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of grace, or majesty, or mystery;--"
2113,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","But, undulating woods, and silent well,"
2114,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom                               _485"
2115,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,"
2116,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Held commune with him, as if he and it"
2117,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Were all that was,--only...when his regard"
2118,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Was raised by intense pensiveness,...two eyes,"
2119,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought,                       _490"
2120,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",And seemed with their serene and azure smiles
2121,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",To beckon him.
2122,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",
2123,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Obedient to the light
2124,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing"
2125,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The windings of the dell.--The rivulet,"
2126,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine                         _495"
2127,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell
2128,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Among the moss with hollow harmony
2129,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones
2130,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",It danced; like childhood laughing as it went:
2131,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept,                _500"
2132,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Reflecting every herb and drooping bud
2133,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",That overhung its quietness.--'O stream!
2134,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Whose source is inaccessibly profound,"
2135,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Whither do thy mysterious waters tend?
2136,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,                        _505"
2137,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,"
2138,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Thy searchless fountain, and invisible course"

2142,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Contains thy waters, as the universe"
2143,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched"

2146,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",
2147,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Beside the grassy shore
2148,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Of the small stream he went; he did impress                          _515
2149,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught"
2150,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one
2151,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Roused by some joyous madness from the couch
2152,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of fever, he did move; yet, not like him,"
2153,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame                        _520"
2154,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of his frail exultation shall be spent,"
2155,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",He must descend. With rapid steps he went
2156,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow"
2157,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now
2158,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",The forest's solemn canopies were changed                            _525
2159,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",For the uniform and lightsome evening sky.
2160,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed"
2161,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",The struggling brook; tall spires of windlestrae
2162,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope,"
2163,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",And nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines                        _530
2164,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots"
2165,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here,"
2166,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,"
2167,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin"
2168,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes                             _535"
2169,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Had shone, gleam stony orbs:--so from his steps"

2174,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there
2175,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Fretted a path through its descending curves
2176,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",With its wintry speed. On every side now rose
2177,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms,"
2178,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Lifted their black and barren pinnacles                              _545
2179,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","In the light of evening, and its precipice"

2184,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,"
2185,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","And seems, with its accumulated crags,"
2186,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",To overhang the world: for wide expand
2187,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Beneath the wan stars and descending moon
2188,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,                       _555"
2189,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom"
2190,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills"
2191,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge"

2194,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Made contrast with the universe. A pine,"
2195,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy"
2196,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast"
2197,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Yielding one only response, at each pause"
2198,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","In most familiar cadence, with the howl                              _565"
2199,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams
2200,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river"
2201,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,"
2202,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Fell into that immeasurable void
2203,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Scattering its waters to the passing winds.                          _570
2204,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",
2205,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine

2208,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,"
2209,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",It overlooked in its serenity                                        _575
2210,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The dark earth, and the bending vault of stars."
2211,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","It was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile"

2213,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The fissured stones with its entwining arms,"
2214,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","And did embower with leaves for ever green,                          _580"
2215,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","And berries dark, the smooth and even space"

2225,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",Alone inspired its echoes;--even that voice
2226,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Which hither came, floating among the winds,"

2237,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","The dim and horned moon hung low, and poured"
2238,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",A sea of lustre on the horizon's verge
2239,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.",That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist
2240,"ALASTOR: OR, THE SPIRIT OF SOLITUDE.","Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank                           _605"

2367,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","""Alastor"" is written in a very different tone from ""Queen Mab"". In the"
2368,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","latter, Shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his"
2369,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","youth--all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy, censure, and hope,"
2370,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","to which the present suffering, and what he considers the proper"
2371,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","destiny of his fellow-creatures, gave birth. ""Alastor"", on the"
2372,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","contrary, contains an individual interest only. A very few years, with"
2373,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","their attendant events, had checked the ardour of Shelley's hopes,"
2374,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","though he still thought them well-grounded, and that to advance their"
2375,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve.
2376,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
2377,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",This is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that
2378,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","chequered his life. It will be sufficient to say that, in all he did,"
2379,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own
2380,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",conscience; while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends
2381,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",brought home to him the sad realities of life. Physical suffering had
2382,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward;
2383,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his
2384,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","own soul than to glance abroad, and to make, as in ""Queen Mab"", the"
2385,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",whole universe the object and subject of his song. In the Spring of
2386,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","1815, an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a"
2387,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","consumption; abscesses were formed on his lungs, and he suffered acute"
2388,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",spasms. Suddenly a complete change took place; and though through life
2389,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","he was a martyr to pain and debility, every symptom of pulmonary"
2390,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","disease vanished. His nerves, which nature had formed sensitive to an"
2391,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","unexampled degree, were rendered still more susceptible by the state"
2392,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",of his health.
2393,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
2394,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","As soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the Continent, he went abroad."
2395,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","He visited some of the more magnificent scenes of Switzerland, and"
2396,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","returned to England from Lucerne, by the Reuss and the Rhine. This"
2397,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","river-navigation enchanted him. In his favourite poem of ""Thalaba"","
2398,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",his imagination had been excited by a description of such a voyage. In
2399,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the summer of 1815, after a tour along the southern coast of"
2400,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Devonshire and a visit to Clifton, he rented a house on Bishopgate"
2401,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Heath, on the borders of Windsor Forest, where he enjoyed several"
2402,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",months of comparative health and tranquil happiness. The later summer
2403,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","months were warm and dry. Accompanied by a few friends, he visited the"
2404,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","source of the Thames, making a voyage in a wherry from Windsor to"
2405,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Crichlade. His beautiful stanzas in the churchyard of Lechlade were
2406,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","written on that occasion. ""Alastor"" was composed on his return. He"
2407,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",spent his days under the oak-shades of Windsor Great Park; and the
2408,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",magnificent woodland was a fitting study to inspire the various
2409,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",descriptions of forest scenery we find in the poem.
2410,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
2411,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",None of Shelley's poems is more characteristic than this. The solemn
2412,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","spirit that reigns throughout, the worship of the majesty of nature,"
2413,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",the broodings of a poet's heart in solitude--the mingling of the
2414,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",exulting joy which the various aspects of the visible universe
2415,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",inspires with the sad and struggling pangs which human passion
2416,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",imparts--give a touching interest to the whole. The death which he had
2417,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",often contemplated during the last months as certain and near he here
2418,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","represented in such colours as had, in his lonely musings, soothed his"
2419,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",soul to peace. The versification sustains the solemn spirit which
2420,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",breathes throughout: it is peculiarly melodious. The poem ought rather
2421,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",to be considered didactic than narrative: it was the outpouring of his
2422,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","own emotions, embodied in the purest form he could conceive, painted"
2423,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","in the ideal hues which his brilliant imagination inspired, and"
2424,"NOTE ON ALASTOR, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",softened by the recent anticipation of death.

2461,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.
2462,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2463,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,The Poem which I now present to the world is an attempt from which I
2464,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"scarcely dare to expect success, and in which a writer of established"
2465,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,fame might fail without disgrace. It is an experiment on the temper of
2466,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the public mind, as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of"
2467,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"moral and political society survives, among the enlightened and"
2468,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"refined, the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live. I"
2469,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language, the ethereal"
2470,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"combinations of the fancy, the rapid and subtle transitions of human"
2471,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"passion, all those elements which essentially compose a Poem, in the"
2472,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,cause of a liberal and comprehensive morality; and in the view of
2473,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,kindling within the bosoms of my readers a virtuous enthusiasm for
2474,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"those doctrines of liberty and justice, that faith and hope in"
2475,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"something good, which neither violence nor misrepresentation nor"
2476,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,prejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind.
2477,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2478,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,For this purpose I have chosen a story of human passion in its most
2479,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"universal character, diversified with moving and romantic adventures,"
2480,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"and appealing, in contempt of all artificial opinions or institutions,"
2481,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,to the common sympathies of every human breast. I have made no attempt
2482,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,to recommend the motives which I would substitute for those at present
2483,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"governing mankind, by methodical and systematic argument. I would only"
2484,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"awaken the feelings, so that the reader should see the beauty of true"
2485,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"virtue, and be incited to those inquiries which have led to my moral"
2486,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"and political creed, and that of some of the sublimest intellects in"
2487,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the world. The Poem therefore (with the exception of the first canto,"
2488,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"which is purely introductory) is narrative, not didactic. It is a"
2489,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,succession of pictures illustrating the growth and progress of
2490,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"individual mind aspiring after excellence, and devoted to the love of"
2491,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,mankind; its influence in refining and making pure the most daring and
2492,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"uncommon impulses of the imagination, the understanding, and the"
2493,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,senses; its impatience at 'all the oppressions which are done under
2494,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the sun;' its tendency to awaken public hope, and to enlighten and"
2495,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,improve mankind; the rapid effects of the application of that
2496,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,tendency; the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and
2497,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,degradation to a true sense of moral dignity and freedom; the
2498,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"bloodless dethronement of their oppressors, and the unveiling of the"
2499,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,religious frauds by which they had been deluded into submission; the
2500,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"tranquillity of successful patriotism, and the universal toleration"
2501,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,and benevolence of true philanthropy; the treachery and barbarity of
2502,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"hired soldiers; vice not the object of punishment and hatred, but"
2503,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,kindness and pity; the faithlessness of tyrants; the confederacy of
2504,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the Rulers of the World and the restoration of the expelled Dynasty by
2505,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"foreign arms; the massacre and extermination of the Patriots, and the"
2506,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,victory of established power; the consequences of legitimate
2507,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"despotism,--civil war, famine, plague, superstition, and an utter"
2508,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,extinction of the domestic affections; the judicial murder of the
2509,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"advocates of Liberty; the temporary triumph of oppression, that secure"
2510,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,earnest of its final and inevitable fall; the transient nature of
2511,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,ignorance and error and the eternity of genius and virtue. Such is the
2512,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"series of delineations of which the Poem consists. And, if the lofty"
2513,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,passions with which it has been my scope to distinguish this story
2514,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"shall not excite in the reader a generous impulse, an ardent thirst"
2515,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"for excellence, an interest profound and strong such as belongs to no"
2516,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"meaner desires, let not the failure be imputed to a natural unfitness"
2517,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,for human sympathy in these sublime and animating themes. It is the
2518,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,business of the Poet to communicate to others the pleasure and the
2519,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,enthusiasm arising out of those images and feelings in the vivid
2520,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,presence of which within his own mind consists at once his inspiration
2521,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,and his reward.
2522,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2523,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"The panic which, like an epidemic transport, seized upon all classes"
2524,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"of men during the excesses consequent upon the French Revolution, is"
2525,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,gradually giving place to sanity. It has ceased to be believed that
2526,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to a hopeless
2527,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"inheritance of ignorance and misery, because a nation of men who had"
2528,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,been dupes and slaves for centuries were incapable of conducting
2529,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some
2530,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,of their fetters were partially loosened. That their conduct could not
2531,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,have been marked by any other characters than ferocity and
2532,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,thoughtlessness is the historical fact from which liberty derives all
2533,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"its recommendations, and falsehood the worst features of its"
2534,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,deformity. There is a reflux in the tide of human things which bears
2535,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the shipwrecked hopes of men into a secure haven after the storms are
2536,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"past. Methinks, those who now live have survived an age of despair."
2537,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2538,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,The French Revolution may be considered as one of those manifestations
2539,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,of a general state of feeling among civilised mankind produced by a
2540,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,defect of correspondence between the knowledge existing in society and
2541,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the improvement or gradual abolition of political institutions. The
2542,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,year 1788 may be assumed as the epoch of one of the most important
2543,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,crises produced by this feeling. The sympathies connected with that
2544,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,event extended to every bosom. The most generous and amiable natures
2545,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,were those which participated the most extensively in these
2546,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,sympathies. But such a degree of unmingled good was expected as it was
2547,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,impossible to realise. If the Revolution had been in every respect
2548,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"prosperous, then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims"
2549,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"to our abhorrence, as fetters which the captive can unlock with the"
2550,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"slightest motion of his fingers, and which do not eat with poisonous"
2551,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,rust into the soul. The revulsion occasioned by the atrocities of the
2552,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"demagogues, and the re-establishment of successive tyrannies in"
2553,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"France, was terrible, and felt in the remotest corner of the civilised"
2554,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,world. Could they listen to the plea of reason who had groaned under
2555,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the calamities of a social state according to the provisions of which
2556,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,one man riots in luxury whilst another famishes for want of bread? Can
2557,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,he who the day before was a trampled slave suddenly become
2558,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"liberal-minded, forbearing, and independent? This is the consequence"
2559,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,of the habits of a state of society to be produced by resolute
2560,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"perseverance and indefatigable hope, and long-suffering and"
2561,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"long-believing courage, and the systematic efforts of generations of"
2562,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,men of intellect and virtue. Such is the lesson which experience
2563,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"teaches now. But, on the first reverses of hope in the progress of"
2564,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"French liberty, the sanguine eagerness for good overleaped the"
2565,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"solution of these questions, and for a time extinguished itself in the"
2566,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"unexpectedness of their result. Thus, many of the most ardent and"
2567,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,tender-hearted of the worshippers of public good have been morally
2568,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,ruined by what a partial glimpse of the events they deplored appeared
2569,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,to show as the melancholy desolation of all their cherished hopes.
2570,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,Hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age
2571,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"in which we live, the solace of a disappointment that unconsciously"
2572,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,finds relief only in the wilful exaggeration of its own despair. This
2573,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,influence has tainted the literature of the age with the hopelessness
2574,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,of the minds from which it flows. Metaphysics (I ought to except sir
2575,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"W. Drummond's ""Academical Questions""; a volume of very acute and"
2576,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"powerful metaphysical criticism.), and inquiries into moral and"
2577,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"political science, have become little else than vain attempts to"
2578,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"revive exploded superstitions, or sophisms like those of Mr. Malthus"
2579,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"(It is remarkable, as a symptom of the revival of public hope, that"
2580,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Mr. Malthus has assigned, in the later editions of his work, an"
2581,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,indefinite dominion to moral restraint over the principle of
2582,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,population. This concession answers all the inferences from his
2583,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"doctrine unfavourable to human improvement, and reduces the ""Essay on"
2584,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Population"" to a commentary illustrative of the unanswerableness of"
2585,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"""Political Justice"".), calculated to lull the oppressors of mankind"
2586,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,into a security of everlasting triumph. Our works of fiction and
2587,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,poetry have been overshadowed by the same infectious gloom. But
2588,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"mankind appear to me to be emerging from their trance. I am aware,"
2589,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"methinks, of a slow, gradual, silent change. In that belief I have"
2590,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,composed the following Poem.
2591,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2592,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,I do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest
2593,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,contemporary Poets. Yet I am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of
2594,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,any who have preceded me. I have sought to avoid the imitation of any
2595,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of
2596,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"which it is the character; designing that, even if what I have"
2597,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"produced be worthless, it should still be properly my own. Nor have I"
2598,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of
2599,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the reader, from whatever interest I may have succeeded in creating,"
2600,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,to my own ingenuity in contriving to disgust them according to the
2601,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,rules of criticism. I have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared
2602,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,to me the most obvious and appropriate language. A person familiar
2603,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"with nature, and with the most celebrated productions of the human"
2604,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"mind, can scarcely err in following the instinct, with respect to"
2605,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"selection of language, produced by that familiarity."
2606,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2607,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"There is an education peculiarly fitted for a Poet, without which"
2608,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,genius and sensibility can hardly fill the circle of their capacities.
2609,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"No education, indeed, can entitle to this appellation a dull and"
2610,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"unobservant mind, or one, though neither dull nor unobservant, in"
2611,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,which the channels of communication between thought and expression
2612,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,have been obstructed or closed. How far it is my fortune to belong to
2613,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,either of the latter classes I cannot know. I aspire to be something
2614,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,better. The circumstances of my accidental education have been
2615,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,favourable to this ambition. I have been familiar from boyhood with
2616,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"mountains and lakes and the sea, and the solitude of forests: Danger,"
2617,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"which sports upon the brink of precipices, has been my playmate. I"
2618,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"have trodden the glaciers of the Alps, and lived under the eye of Mont"
2619,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,Blanc. I have been a wanderer among distant fields. I have sailed down
2620,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"mighty rivers, and seen the sun rise and set, and the stars come"
2621,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"forth, whilst I have sailed night and day down a rapid stream among"
2622,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"mountains. I have seen populous cities, and have watched the passions"
2623,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"which rise and spread, and sink and change, amongst assembled"
2624,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,multitudes of men. I have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages
2625,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"of tyranny and war, cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of"
2626,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"black and roofless houses, and the naked inhabitants sitting famished"
2627,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,upon their desolated thresholds. I have conversed with living men of
2628,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"genius. The poetry of ancient Greece and Rome, and modern Italy, and"
2629,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"our own country, has been to me, like external nature, a passion and"
2630,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,an enjoyment. Such are the sources from which the materials for the
2631,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,imagery of my Poem have been drawn. I have considered Poetry in its
2632,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,most comprehensive sense; and have read the Poets and the Historians
2633,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,and the Metaphysicians (In this sense there may be such a thing as
2634,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"perfectibility in works of fiction, notwithstanding the concession"
2635,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"often made by the advocates of human improvement, that perfectibility"
2636,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,is a term applicable only to science.) whose writings have been
2637,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"accessible to me, and have looked upon the beautiful and majestic"
2638,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"scenery of the earth, as common sources of those elements which it is"
2639,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the province of the Poet to embody and combine. Yet the experience and
2640,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the feelings to which I refer do not in themselves constitute men
2641,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Poets, but only prepares them to be the auditors of those who are. How"
2642,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,far I shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of
2643,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Poetry, the power of awakening in others sensations like those which"
2644,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"animate my own bosom, is that which, to speak sincerely, I know not;"
2645,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"and which, with an acquiescent and contented spirit, I expect to be"
2646,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,taught by the effect which I shall produce upon those whom I now
2647,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,address.
2648,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2649,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"I have avoided, as I have said before, the imitation of any"
2650,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"contemporary style. But there must be a resemblance, which does not"
2651,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"depend upon their own will, between all the writers of any particular"
2652,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,age. They cannot escape from subjection to a common influence which
2653,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to
2654,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the times in which they live; though each is in a degree the author of
2655,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the very influence by which his being is thus pervaded. Thus, the"
2656,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,tragic poets of the age of Pericles; the Italian revivers of ancient
2657,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,learning; those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded
2658,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the Reformation, the translators of the Bible, Shakespeare, Spenser,"
2659,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the Dramatists of the reign of Elizabeth, and Lord Bacon (Milton"
2660,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,stands alone in the age which he illumined.); the colder spirits of
2661,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the interval that succeeded;--all resemble each other, and differ from"
2662,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"every other in their several classes. In this view of things, Ford can"
2663,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,no more be called the imitator of Shakespeare than Shakespeare the
2664,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,imitator of Ford. There were perhaps few other points of resemblance
2665,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable
2666,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,influence of their age produced. And this is an influence which
2667,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any era can
2668,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,escape; and which I have not attempted to escape.
2669,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2670,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,I have adopted the stanza of Spenser (a measure inexpressibly
2671,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"beautiful), not because I consider it a finer model of poetical"
2672,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"harmony than the blank verse of Shakespeare and Milton, but because in"
2673,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity; you must either succeed
2674,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,or fail. This perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire. But I was
2675,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind
2676,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just
2677,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure. Yet there
2678,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,will be found some instances where I have completely failed in this
2679,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"attempt, and one, which I here request the reader to consider as an"
2680,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"erratum, where there is left, most inadvertently, an alexandrine in"
2681,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the middle of a stanza.
2682,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2683,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"But in this, as in every other respect, I have written fearlessly. It"
2684,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"is the misfortune of this age that its Writers, too thoughtless of"
2685,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"immortality, are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame."
2686,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,They write with the fear of Reviews before their eyes. This system of
2687,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when Poetry was not.
2688,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Poetry, and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers,"
2689,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,cannot subsist together. Longinus could not have been the contemporary
2690,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"of Homer, nor Boileau of Horace. Yet this species of criticism never"
2691,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"presumed to assert an understanding of its own; it has always, unlike"
2692,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"true science, followed, not preceded, the opinion of mankind, and"
2693,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest
2694,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations, and"
2695,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius
2696,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own. I have sought
2697,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"therefore to write, as I believe that Homer, Shakespeare, and Milton"
2698,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"wrote, with an utter disregard of anonymous censure. I am certain that"
2699,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"calumny and misrepresentation, though it may move me to compassion,"
2700,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,cannot disturb my peace. I shall understand the expressive silence of
2701,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak. I
2702,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"shall endeavour to extract, from the midst of insult and contempt and"
2703,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"maledictions, those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever"
2704,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious
2705,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,appeal to the Public. If certain Critics were as clear-sighted as they
2706,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"are malignant, how great would be the benefit to be derived from their"
2707,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"virulent writings! As it is, I fear I shall be malicious enough to be"
2708,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives. Should the Public
2709,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"judge that my composition is worthless, I shall indeed bow before the"
2710,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"tribunal from which Milton received his crown of immortality, and"
2711,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"shall seek to gather, if I live, strength from that defeat, which may"
2712,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless.
2713,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"I cannot conceive that Lucretius, when he meditated that poem whose"
2714,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge, and whose"
2715,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"eloquence has been the wonder of mankind, wrote in awe of such censure"
2716,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of Rome
2717,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,might affix to what he should produce. It was at the period when
2718,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Greece was led captive and Asia made tributary to the Republic, fast"
2719,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"verging itself to slavery and ruin, that a multitude of Syrian"
2720,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"captives, bigoted to the worship of their obscene Ashtaroth, and the"
2721,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"unworthy successors of Socrates and Zeno, found there a precarious"
2722,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"subsistence by administering, under the name of freedmen, to the vices"
2723,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"and vanities of the great. These wretched men were skilled to plead,"
2724,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms, in favour of that"
2725,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves, and that faith in"
2726,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"portents, the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the"
2727,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"imaginations of men, which, arising from the enslaved communities of"
2728,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"the East, then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its"
2729,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,stream. Were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and
2730,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,lofty-minded Lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe? The
2731,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps
2732,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,would disdain to hold life on such conditions.
2733,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2734,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,The Poem now presented to the Public occupied little more than six
2735,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,months in the composition. That period has been devoted to the task
2736,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm. I have exercised a watchful
2737,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands. I would
2738,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which
2739,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"long labour and revision is said to bestow. But I found that, if I"
2740,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"should gain something in exactness by this method, I might lose much"
2741,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh
2742,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"from my mind. And, although the mere composition occupied no more than"
2743,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"six months, the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many"
2744,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,years.
2745,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,
2746,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,I trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those
2747,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the
2748,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"characters which they are designed to elucidate, and such as are"
2749,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,properly my own. The erroneous and degrading idea which men have
2750,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"conceived of a Supreme Being, for instance, is spoken against, but not"
2751,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,the Supreme Being itself. The belief which some superstitious persons
2752,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"whom I have brought upon the stage entertain of the Deity, as"
2753,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"injurious to the character of his benevolence, is widely different"
2754,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,from my own. In recommending also a great and important change in the
2755,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind, I have"
2756,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our
2757,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the
2758,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"most beneficial innovations. There is no quarter given to Revenge, or"
2759,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,"Envy, or Prejudice. Love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law"
2760,AUTHOR'S PREFACE.,which should govern the moral world.

2934,CANTO 1.,When the last hope of trampled France had failed
2935,CANTO 1.,"Like a brief dream of unremaining glory,"
2936,CANTO 1.,"From visions of despair I rose, and scaled"
2937,CANTO 1.,"The peak of an aerial promontory,                                    _130"
2938,CANTO 1.,Whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary;
2939,CANTO 1.,"And saw the golden dawn break forth, and waken"
2940,CANTO 1.,"Each cloud, and every wave:--but transitory"
2941,CANTO 1.,"The calm; for sudden, the firm earth was shaken,"
2942,CANTO 1.,As if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken.                    _135

2945,CANTO 1.,"So as I stood, one blast of muttering thunder"
2946,CANTO 1.,"Burst in far peals along the waveless deep,"
2947,CANTO 1.,"When, gathering fast, around, above, and under,"
2948,CANTO 1.,"Long trains of tremulous mist began to creep,"
2949,CANTO 1.,Until their complicating lines did steep                             _140
2950,CANTO 1.,The orient sun in shadow:--not a sound
2951,CANTO 1.,Was heard; one horrible repose did keep
2952,CANTO 1.,"The forests and the floods, and all around"
2953,CANTO 1.,Darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground.
2954,CANTO 1.,
2955,CANTO 1.,3.
2956,CANTO 1.,Hark! 'tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps                         _145
2957,CANTO 1.,Earth and the ocean. See! the lightnings yawn
2958,CANTO 1.,"Deluging Heaven with fire, and the lashed deeps"

2960,CANTO 1.,"One mighty stream, whirlwind and waves upthrown,"
2961,CANTO 1.,"Lightning, and hail, and darkness eddying by.                        _150"
2962,CANTO 1.,"There is a pause--the sea-birds, that were gone"

2970,CANTO 1.,"Most delicately, and the ocean green,"
2971,CANTO 1.,"Beneath that opening spot of blue serene,"
2972,CANTO 1.,Quivered like burning emerald; calm was spread

2978,CANTO 1.,"For ever, as the war became more fierce"
2979,CANTO 1.,"Between the whirlwinds and the rack on high,"
2980,CANTO 1.,That spot grew more serene; blue light did pierce                    _165
2981,CANTO 1.,"The woof of those white clouds, which seem to lie"
2982,CANTO 1.,"Far, deep, and motionless; while through the sky"
2983,CANTO 1.,The pallid semicircle of the moon
2984,CANTO 1.,"Passed on, in slow and moving majesty;"
2985,CANTO 1.,"Its upper horn arrayed in mists, which soon                          _170"

2987,CANTO 1.,
2988,CANTO 1.,6.
2989,CANTO 1.,I could not choose but gaze; a fascination

2991,CANTO 1.,"My fancy thither, and in expectation"

2993,CANTO 1.,"Of the white moon, amid that heaven so blue,"
2994,CANTO 1.,Suddenly stained with shadow did appear;
2995,CANTO 1.,"A speck, a cloud, a shape, approaching grew,"
2996,CANTO 1.,Like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere
2997,CANTO 1.,"Beheld afar at sea, and swift it came anear.                         _180"

3002,CANTO 1.,"Which there collects the strength of all its fountains,"
3003,CANTO 1.,"Comes forth, whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver,"
3004,CANTO 1.,"Sails, oars and stream, tending to one endeavour;                    _185"
3005,CANTO 1.,"So, from that chasm of light a winged Form"
3006,CANTO 1.,On all the winds of heaven approaching ever
3007,CANTO 1.,"Floated, dilating as it came; the storm"

3009,CANTO 1.,
3010,CANTO 1.,8.
3011,CANTO 1.,"A course precipitous, of dizzy speed,                                _190"
3012,CANTO 1.,Suspending thought and breath; a monstrous sight!
3013,CANTO 1.,For in the air do I behold indeed
3014,CANTO 1.,An Eagle and a Serpent wreathed in fight:--
3015,CANTO 1.,"And now, relaxing its impetuous flight,"
3016,CANTO 1.,"Before the aerial rock on which I stood,                             _195"
3017,CANTO 1.,"The Eagle, hovering, wheeled to left and right,"

3019,CANTO 1.,And startled with its yells the wide air's solitude.
3020,CANTO 1.,
3021,CANTO 1.,9.
3022,CANTO 1.,"A shaft of light upon its wings descended,"
3023,CANTO 1.,And every golden feather gleamed therein--                           _200
3024,CANTO 1.,"Feather and scale, inextricably blended."
3025,CANTO 1.,The Serpent's mailed and many-coloured skin
3026,CANTO 1.,Shone through the plumes its coils were twined within
3027,CANTO 1.,"By many a swoln and knotted fold, and high"

3029,CANTO 1.,"Sustained a crested head, which warily"
3030,CANTO 1.,Shifted and glanced before the Eagle's steadfast eye.
3031,CANTO 1.,
3032,CANTO 1.,10.
3033,CANTO 1.,"Around, around, in ceaseless circles wheeling"
3034,CANTO 1.,"With clang of wings and scream, the Eagle sailed"

3036,CANTO 1.,"Its lessening orbs, sometimes as if it failed,"
3037,CANTO 1.,"Drooped through the air; and still it shrieked and wailed,"
3038,CANTO 1.,"And casting back its eager head, with beak"
3039,CANTO 1.,And talon unremittingly assailed
3040,CANTO 1.,"The wreathed Serpent, who did ever seek                              _215"
3041,CANTO 1.,Upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak.

3043,CANTO 1.,11.
3044,CANTO 1.,"What life, what power, was kindled and arose"
3045,CANTO 1.,Within the sphere of that appalling fray!
3046,CANTO 1.,"For, from the encounter of those wondrous foes,"
3047,CANTO 1.,A vapour like the sea's suspended spray                              _220
3048,CANTO 1.,"Hung gathered; in the void air, far away,"
3049,CANTO 1.,"Floated the shattered plumes; bright scales did leap,"
3050,CANTO 1.,"Where'er the Eagle's talons made their way,"
3051,CANTO 1.,"Like sparks into the darkness;--as they sweep,"
3052,CANTO 1.,Blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep.                  _225
3053,CANTO 1.,
3054,CANTO 1.,12.
3055,CANTO 1.,"Swift chances in that combat--many a check,"
3056,CANTO 1.,"And many a change, a dark and wild turmoil;"
3057,CANTO 1.,Sometimes the Snake around his enemy's neck
3058,CANTO 1.,"Locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil,"
3059,CANTO 1.,"Until the Eagle, faint with pain and toil,                           _230"
3060,CANTO 1.,"Remitted his strong flight, and near the sea"
3061,CANTO 1.,"Languidly fluttered, hopeless so to foil"
3062,CANTO 1.,"His adversary, who then reared on high"
3063,CANTO 1.,"His red and burning crest, radiant with victory."
3064,CANTO 1.,
3065,CANTO 1.,13.
3066,CANTO 1.,"Then on the white edge of the bursting surge,                        _235"
3067,CANTO 1.,"Where they had sunk together, would the Snake"
3068,CANTO 1.,"Relax his suffocating grasp, and scourge"
3069,CANTO 1.,The wind with his wild writhings; for to break
3070,CANTO 1.,"That chain of torment, the vast bird would shake"
3071,CANTO 1.,The strength of his unconquerable wings                              _240
3072,CANTO 1.,"As in despair, and with his sinewy neck,"
3073,CANTO 1.,Dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings--
3074,CANTO 1.,"Then soar, as swift as smoke from a volcano springs."
3075,CANTO 1.,
3076,CANTO 1.,14.
3077,CANTO 1.,"Wile baffled wile, and strength encountered strength,"

3079,CANTO 1.,Of that portentous fight appeared at length:
3080,CANTO 1.,Until the lamp of day was almost spent
3081,CANTO 1.,"It had endured, when lifeless, stark, and rent,"
3082,CANTO 1.,"Hung high that mighty Serpent, and at last"
3083,CANTO 1.,"Fell to the sea, while o'er the continent                            _250"
3084,CANTO 1.,"With clang of wings and scream the Eagle passed,"
3085,CANTO 1.,Heavily borne away on the exhausted blast.
3086,CANTO 1.,
3087,CANTO 1.,15.
3088,CANTO 1.,"And with it fled the tempest, so that ocean"
3089,CANTO 1.,And earth and sky shone through the atmosphere--
3090,CANTO 1.,"Only, 'twas strange to see the red commotion                         _255"
3091,CANTO 1.,Of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere
3092,CANTO 1.,"Of sunset sweep, and their fierce roar to hear"
3093,CANTO 1.,Amid the calm: down the steep path I wound
3094,CANTO 1.,To the sea-shore--the evening was most clear
3095,CANTO 1.,"And beautiful, and there the sea I found                             _260"
3096,CANTO 1.,Calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound.
3097,CANTO 1.,
3098,CANTO 1.,16.
3099,CANTO 1.,"There was a Woman, beautiful as morning,"
3100,CANTO 1.,"Sitting beneath the rocks, upon the sand"
3101,CANTO 1.,Of the waste sea--fair as one flower adorning
3102,CANTO 1.,An icy wilderness; each delicate hand                                _265
3103,CANTO 1.,"Lay crossed upon her bosom, and the band"
3104,CANTO 1.,"Of her dark hair had fall'n, and so she sate"
3105,CANTO 1.,Looking upon the waves; on the bare strand

3108,CANTO 1.,
3109,CANTO 1.,17.
3110,CANTO 1.,It seemed that this fair Shape had looked upon
3111,CANTO 1.,"That unimaginable fight, and now"
3112,CANTO 1.,"That her sweet eyes were weary of the sun,"
3113,CANTO 1.,As brightly it illustrated her woe;
3114,CANTO 1.,For in the tears which silently to flow                              _275
3115,CANTO 1.,"Paused not, its lustre hung: she watching aye"
3116,CANTO 1.,The foam-wreaths which the faint tide wove below
3117,CANTO 1.,"Upon the spangled sands, groaned heavily,"
3118,CANTO 1.,And after every groan looked up over the sea.
3119,CANTO 1.,

3433,CANTO 1.,"That after many wondrous years were flown,"

3435,CANTO 1.,"And over me a mystic robe was thrown,"

3446,CANTO 1.,"Mountains of ice, like sapphire, piled on high,"

3453,CANTO 1.,Wild music woke me; we had passed the ocean
3454,CANTO 1.,"Which girds the pole, Nature's remotest reign--"
3455,CANTO 1.,And we glode fast o'er a pellucid plain
3456,CANTO 1.,"Of waters, azure with the noontide day.                              _555"

3488,CANTO 1.,Encircling that vast Fane's aerial heap:
3489,CANTO 1.,"We disembarked, and through a portal wide"

3500,CANTO 1.,"That work of subtlest power, divine and rare;"
3501,CANTO 1.,"Orb above orb, with starry shapes between,"

3503,CANTO 1.,On night-black columns poised--one hollow hemisphere!
3504,CANTO 1.,
3505,CANTO 1.,53.
3506,CANTO 1.,Ten thousand columns in that quivering light                         _595

3510,CANTO 1.,"And on the jasper walls around, there lay"
3511,CANTO 1.,"Paintings, the poesy of mightiest thought,                           _600"
3512,CANTO 1.,Which did the Spirit's history display;
3513,CANTO 1.,"A tale of passionate change, divinely taught,"

3527,CANTO 1.,55.
3528,CANTO 1.,"One seat was vacant in the midst, a throne,"
3529,CANTO 1.,"Reared on a pyramid like sculptured flame,"
3530,CANTO 1.,Distinct with circling steps which rested on                         _615
3531,CANTO 1.,Their own deep fire--soon as the Woman came
3532,CANTO 1.,"Into that hall, she shrieked the Spirit's name"
3533,CANTO 1.,And fell; and vanished slowly from the sight.
3534,CANTO 1.,"Darkness arose from her dissolving frame,"
3535,CANTO 1.,"Which gathering, filled that dome of woven light,                    _620"

3545,CANTO 1.,One clear and mighty planet hanging o'er
3546,CANTO 1.,"A cloud of deepest shadow, which was thrown"

3563,CANTO 1.,Whose touch was magic strength; an eye of blue
3564,CANTO 1.,"Looked into mine, like moonlight, soothingly;"
3565,CANTO 1.,And a voice said:--'Thou must a listener be

3741,CANTO 2.,"The multitude, and like a sulphurous hill,                           _785"
3742,CANTO 2.,Which on a sudden from its snows has shaken
3743,CANTO 2.,"The swoon of ages, it shall burst and fill"
3744,CANTO 2.,"The world with cleansing fire; it must, it will--"
3745,CANTO 2.,It may not be restrained!--and who shall stand
3746,CANTO 2.,"Amid the rocking earthquake steadfast still,                         _790"
3747,CANTO 2.,But Laon? on high Freedom's desert land
3748,CANTO 2.,A tower whose marble walls the leagued storms withstand!
3749,CANTO 2.,
3750,CANTO 2.,15.
3751,CANTO 2.,"One summer night, in commune with the hope"
3752,CANTO 2.,"Thus deeply fed, amid those ruins gray"
3753,CANTO 2.,"I watched, beneath the dark sky's starry cope;                       _795"
3754,CANTO 2.,And ever from that hour upon me lay
3755,CANTO 2.,"The burden of this hope, and night or day,"
3756,CANTO 2.,"In vision or in dream, clove to my breast:"
3757,CANTO 2.,"Among mankind, or when gone far away"
3758,CANTO 2.,"To the lone shores and mountains, 'twas a guest                      _800"
3759,CANTO 2.,"Which followed where I fled, and watched when I did rest."
3760,CANTO 2.,
3761,CANTO 2.,16.
3762,CANTO 2.,These hopes found words through which my spirit sought
3763,CANTO 2.,"To weave a bondage of such sympathy,"
3764,CANTO 2.,As might create some response to the thought
3765,CANTO 2.,Which ruled me now--and as the vapours lie                           _805
3766,CANTO 2.,"Bright in the outspread morning's radiancy,"
3767,CANTO 2.,So were these thoughts invested with the light
3768,CANTO 2.,Of language: and all bosoms made reply
3769,CANTO 2.,"On which its lustre streamed, whene'er it might"
3770,CANTO 2.,Through darkness wide and deep those tranced spirits smite.          _810
3771,CANTO 2.,
3772,CANTO 2.,17.
3773,CANTO 2.,"Yes, many an eye with dizzy tears was dim,"
3774,CANTO 2.,"And oft I thought to clasp my own heart's brother,"
3775,CANTO 2.,"When I could feel the listener's senses swim,"
3776,CANTO 2.,And hear his breath its own swift gaspings smother
3777,CANTO 2.,"Even as my words evoked them--and another,                           _815"
3778,CANTO 2.,"And yet another, I did fondly deem,"
3779,CANTO 2.,Felt that we all were sons of one great mother;
3780,CANTO 2.,And the cold truth such sad reverse did seem
3781,CANTO 2.,As to awake in grief from some delightful dream.
3782,CANTO 2.,
3783,CANTO 2.,18.
3784,CANTO 2.,"Yes, oft beside the ruined labyrinth                                 _820"
3785,CANTO 2.,"Which skirts the hoary caves of the green deep,"
3786,CANTO 2.,"Did Laon and his friend, on one gray plinth,"
3787,CANTO 2.,"Round whose worn base the wild waves hiss and leap,"
3788,CANTO 2.,"Resting at eve, a lofty converse keep:"
3789,CANTO 2.,"And that this friend was false, may now be said                      _825"
3790,CANTO 2.,Calmly--that he like other men could weep
3791,CANTO 2.,"Tears which are lies, and could betray and spread"
3792,CANTO 2.,Snares for that guileless heart which for his own had bled.
3793,CANTO 2.,
3794,CANTO 2.,19.
3795,CANTO 2.,"Then, had no great aim recompensed my sorrow,"
3796,CANTO 2.,I must have sought dark respite from its stress                      _830
3797,CANTO 2.,"In dreamless rest, in sleep that sees no morrow--"
3798,CANTO 2.,For to tread life's dismaying wilderness
3799,CANTO 2.,"Without one smile to cheer, one voice to bless,"
3800,CANTO 2.,"Amid the snares and scoffs of human kind,"
3801,CANTO 2.,"Is hard--but I betrayed it not, nor less                             _835"
3802,CANTO 2.,With love that scorned return sought to unbind
3803,CANTO 2.,The interwoven clouds which make its wisdom blind.
3804,CANTO 2.,
3805,CANTO 2.,20.
3806,CANTO 2.,With deathless minds which leave where they have passed
3807,CANTO 2.,"A path of light, my soul communion knew;"
3808,CANTO 2.,"Till from that glorious intercourse, at last,                        _840"
3809,CANTO 2.,"As from a mine of magic store, I drew"
3810,CANTO 2.,Words which were weapons;--round my heart there grew
3811,CANTO 2.,The adamantine armour of their power;
3812,CANTO 2.,And from my fancy wings of golden hue
3813,CANTO 2.,"Sprang forth--yet not alone from wisdom's tower,                     _845"
3814,CANTO 2.,"A minister of truth, these plumes young Laon bore."
3815,CANTO 2.,
3816,CANTO 2.,21.
3817,CANTO 2.,"An orphan with my parents lived, whose eyes"
3818,CANTO 2.,"Were lodestars of delight, which drew me home"
3819,CANTO 2.,When I might wander forth; nor did I prize
3820,CANTO 2.,Aught human thing beneath Heaven's mighty dome                       _850
3821,CANTO 2.,"Beyond this child; so when sad hours were come,"
3822,CANTO 2.,"And baffled hope like ice still clung to me,"
3823,CANTO 2.,"Since kin were cold, and friends had now become"
3824,CANTO 2.,"Heartless and false, I turned from all, to be,"
3825,CANTO 2.,"Cythna, the only source of tears and smiles to thee.                 _855"
3826,CANTO 2.,
3827,CANTO 2.,22.
3828,CANTO 2.,"What wert thou then? A child most infantine,"
3829,CANTO 2.,Yet wandering far beyond that innocent age
3830,CANTO 2.,In all but its sweet looks and mien divine;
3831,CANTO 2.,"Even then, methought, with the world's tyrant rage"
3832,CANTO 2.,"A patient warfare thy young heart did wage,                          _860"
3833,CANTO 2.,When those soft eyes of scarcely conscious thought
3834,CANTO 2.,"Some tale, or thine own fancies, would engage"
3835,CANTO 2.,"To overflow with tears, or converse fraught"
3836,CANTO 2.,"With passion, o'er their depths its fleeting light had wrought."
3837,CANTO 2.,
3838,CANTO 2.,23.
3839,CANTO 2.,"She moved upon this earth a shape of brightness,                     _865"
3840,CANTO 2.,"A power, that from its objects scarcely drew"
3841,CANTO 2.,One impulse of her being--in her lightness
3842,CANTO 2.,"Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew,"
3843,CANTO 2.,"Which wanders through the waste air's pathless blue,"
3844,CANTO 2.,To nourish some far desert; she did seem                             _870
3845,CANTO 2.,"Beside me, gathering beauty as she grew,"
3846,CANTO 2.,Like the bright shade of some immortal dream
3847,CANTO 2.,"Which walks, when tempest sleeps, the wave of life's dark stream."
3848,CANTO 2.,
3849,CANTO 2.,24.
3850,CANTO 2.,"As mine own shadow was this child to me,"
3851,CANTO 2.,"A second self, far dearer and more fair;                             _875"
3852,CANTO 2.,Which clothed in undissolving radiancy
3853,CANTO 2.,All those steep paths which languor and despair
3854,CANTO 2.,"Of human things, had made so dark and bare,"
3855,CANTO 2.,"But which I trod alone--nor, till bereft"
3856,CANTO 2.,"Of friends, and overcome by lonely care,                             _880"
3857,CANTO 2.,"Knew I what solace for that loss was left,"
3858,CANTO 2.,Though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft.
3859,CANTO 2.,
3860,CANTO 2.,25.
3861,CANTO 2.,"Once she was dear, now she was all I had"
3862,CANTO 2.,"To love in human life--this playmate sweet,"
3863,CANTO 2.,This child of twelve years old--so she was made                      _885
3864,CANTO 2.,"My sole associate, and her willing feet"
3865,CANTO 2.,"Wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet,"
3866,CANTO 2.,Beyond the aereal mountains whose vast cells
3867,CANTO 2.,"The unreposing billows ever beat,"
3868,CANTO 2.,"Through forests wild and old, and lawny dells                        _890"
3869,CANTO 2.,Where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells.
3870,CANTO 2.,
3871,CANTO 2.,26.
3872,CANTO 2.,And warm and light I felt her clasping hand
3873,CANTO 2.,"When twined in mine; she followed where I went,"
3874,CANTO 2.,Through the lone paths of our immortal land.
3875,CANTO 2.,It had no waste but some memorial lent                               _895
3876,CANTO 2.,Which strung me to my toil--some monument
3877,CANTO 2.,"Vital with mind; then Cythna by my side,"
3878,CANTO 2.,"Until the bright and beaming day were spent,"
3879,CANTO 2.,"Would rest, with looks entreating to abide,"
3880,CANTO 2.,Too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied.                         _900
3881,CANTO 2.,
3882,CANTO 2.,27.
3883,CANTO 2.,And soon I could not have refused her--thus
3884,CANTO 2.,"For ever, day and night, we two were ne'er"
3885,CANTO 2.,"Parted, but when brief sleep divided us:"
3886,CANTO 2.,And when the pauses of the lulling air
3887,CANTO 2.,Of noon beside the sea had made a lair                               _905
3888,CANTO 2.,"For her soothed senses, in my arms she slept,"
3889,CANTO 2.,"And I kept watch over her slumbers there,"
3890,CANTO 2.,"While, as the shifting visions over her swept,"
3891,CANTO 2.,Amid her innocent rest by turns she smiled and wept.
3892,CANTO 2.,
3893,CANTO 2.,28.
3894,CANTO 2.,"And, in the murmur of her dreams was heard                           _910"
3895,CANTO 2.,Sometimes the name of Laon:--suddenly
3896,CANTO 2.,"She would arise, and, like the secret bird"
3897,CANTO 2.,"Whom sunset wakens, fill the shore and sky"
3898,CANTO 2.,"With her sweet accents, a wild melody!"
3899,CANTO 2.,"Hymns which my soul had woven to Freedom, strong                     _915"
3900,CANTO 2.,"The source of passion, whence they rose, to be;"
3901,CANTO 2.,"Triumphant strains, which, like a spirit's tongue,"
3902,CANTO 2.,To the enchanted waves that child of glory sung--
3903,CANTO 2.,
3904,CANTO 2.,29.
3905,CANTO 2.,Her white arms lifted through the shadowy stream
3906,CANTO 2.,"Of her loose hair. Oh, excellently great                             _920"
3907,CANTO 2.,"Seemed to me then my purpose, the vast theme"
3908,CANTO 2.,"Of those impassioned songs, when Cythna sate"
3909,CANTO 2.,Amid the calm which rapture doth create
3910,CANTO 2.,"After its tumult, her heart vibrating,"
3911,CANTO 2.,Her spirit o'er the Ocean's floating state                           _925
3912,CANTO 2.,"From her deep eyes far wandering, on the wing"
3913,CANTO 2.,"Of visions that were mine, beyond its utmost spring!"
3914,CANTO 2.,
3915,CANTO 2.,30.
3916,CANTO 2.,"For, before Cythna loved it, had my song"
3917,CANTO 2.,"Peopled with thoughts the boundless universe,"
3918,CANTO 2.,"A mighty congregation, which were strong                             _930"
3919,CANTO 2.,Where'er they trod the darkness to disperse
3920,CANTO 2.,The cloud of that unutterable curse
3921,CANTO 2.,Which clings upon mankind:--all things became
3922,CANTO 2.,"Slaves to my holy and heroic verse,"
3923,CANTO 2.,"Earth, sea and sky, the planets, life and fame                       _935"
3924,CANTO 2.,"And fate, or whate'er else binds the world's wondrous frame."
3925,CANTO 2.,
3926,CANTO 2.,31.
3927,CANTO 2.,And this beloved child thus felt the sway
3928,CANTO 2.,"Of my conceptions, gathering like a cloud"
3929,CANTO 2.,The very wind on which it rolls away:
3930,CANTO 2.,"Hers too were all my thoughts, ere yet, endowed                      _940"
3931,CANTO 2.,"With music and with light, their fountains flowed"
3932,CANTO 2.,"In poesy; and her still and earnest face,"
3933,CANTO 2.,Pallid with feelings which intensely glowed
3934,CANTO 2.,"Within, was turned on mine with speechless grace,"
3935,CANTO 2.,Watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace.       _945
3936,CANTO 2.,
3937,CANTO 2.,32.
3938,CANTO 2.,"In me, communion with this purest being"
3939,CANTO 2.,"Kindled intenser zeal, and made me wise"
3940,CANTO 2.,"In knowledge, which, in hers mine own mind seeing,"
3941,CANTO 2.,Left in the human world few mysteries:
3942,CANTO 2.,How without fear of evil or disguise                                 _950
3943,CANTO 2.,"Was Cythna!--what a spirit strong and mild,"
3944,CANTO 2.,"Which death, or pain or peril could despise,"
3945,CANTO 2.,Yet melt in tenderness! what genius wild
3946,CANTO 2.,"Yet mighty, was enclosed within one simple child!"
3947,CANTO 2.,
3948,CANTO 2.,33.
3949,CANTO 2.,"New lore was this--old age with its gray hair,                       _955"
3950,CANTO 2.,"And wrinkled legends of unworthy things,"
3951,CANTO 2.,"And icy sneers, is nought: it cannot dare"
3952,CANTO 2.,To burst the chains which life for ever flings
3953,CANTO 2.,"On the entangled soul's aspiring wings,"
3954,CANTO 2.,"So is it cold and cruel, and is made                                 _960"
3955,CANTO 2.,The careless slave of that dark power which brings
3956,CANTO 2.,"Evil, like blight, on man, who, still betrayed,"
3957,CANTO 2.,Laughs o'er the grave in which his living hopes are laid.
3958,CANTO 2.,
3959,CANTO 2.,34.
3960,CANTO 2.,Nor are the strong and the severe to keep
3961,CANTO 2.,The empire of the world: thus Cythna taught                          _965
3962,CANTO 2.,"Even in the visions of her eloquent sleep,"
3963,CANTO 2.,Unconscious of the power through which she wrought
3964,CANTO 2.,"The woof of such intelligible thought,"
3965,CANTO 2.,As from the tranquil strength which cradled lay
3966,CANTO 2.,"In her smile-peopled rest, my spirit sought                          _970"
3967,CANTO 2.,Why the deceiver and the slave has sway
3968,CANTO 2.,O'er heralds so divine of truth's arising day.
3969,CANTO 2.,
3970,CANTO 2.,35.
3971,CANTO 2.,"Within that fairest form, the female mind,"
3972,CANTO 2.,Untainted by the poison clouds which rest
3973,CANTO 2.,"On the dark world, a sacred home did find:                           _975"
3974,CANTO 2.,"But else, from the wide earth's maternal breast,"
3975,CANTO 2.,"Victorious Evil, which had dispossessed"
3976,CANTO 2.,"All native power, had those fair children torn,"
3977,CANTO 2.,"And made them slaves to soothe his vile unrest,"
3978,CANTO 2.,"And minister to lust its joys forlorn,                               _980"

3980,CANTO 2.,
3981,CANTO 2.,36.
3982,CANTO 2.,"This misery was but coldly felt, till she"
3983,CANTO 2.,"Became my only friend, who had endued"
3984,CANTO 2.,My purpose with a wider sympathy;
3985,CANTO 2.,"Thus, Cythna mourned with me the servitude                           _985"
3986,CANTO 2.,In which the half of humankind were mewed
3987,CANTO 2.,"Victims of lust and hate, the slaves of slaves,"
3988,CANTO 2.,She mourned that grace and power were thrown as food
3989,CANTO 2.,"To the hyena lust, who, among graves,"
3990,CANTO 2.,"Over his loathed meal, laughing in agony, raves.                     _990"
3991,CANTO 2.,
3992,CANTO 2.,37.
3993,CANTO 2.,"And I, still gazing on that glorious child,"
3994,CANTO 2.,"Even as these thoughts flushed o'er her:--'Cythna sweet,"
3995,CANTO 2.,Well with the world art thou unreconciled;
3996,CANTO 2.,Never will peace and human nature meet

3998,CANTO 2.,Domestic peace; and ere this power can make
3999,CANTO 2.,"In human hearts its calm and holy seat,"
4000,CANTO 2.,"This slavery must be broken'--as I spake,"
4001,CANTO 2.,From Cythna's eyes a light of exultation brake.
4002,CANTO 2.,
4003,CANTO 2.,38.
4004,CANTO 2.,"She replied earnestly:--'It shall be mine,                           _1000"
4005,CANTO 2.,"This task,--mine, Laon!--thou hast much to gain;"
4006,CANTO 2.,"Nor wilt thou at poor Cythna's pride repine,"

4009,CANTO 2.,When myriads at thy call shall throng around                         _1005
4010,CANTO 2.,The Golden City.'--Then the child did strain
4011,CANTO 2.,"My arm upon her tremulous heart, and wound"
4012,CANTO 2.,"Her own about my neck, till some reply she found."
4013,CANTO 2.,
4014,CANTO 2.,39.
4015,CANTO 2.,"I smiled, and spake not.--'Wherefore dost thou smile"

4018,CANTO 2.,"With thee, if thou desirest, will I seek"
4019,CANTO 2.,Through their array of banded slaves to wreak
4020,CANTO 2.,Ruin upon the tyrants. I had thought
4021,CANTO 2.,It was more hard to turn my unpractised cheek                        _1015
4022,CANTO 2.,"To scorn and shame, and this beloved spot"
4023,CANTO 2.,"And thee, O dearest friend, to leave and murmur not."
4024,CANTO 2.,
4025,CANTO 2.,40.
4026,CANTO 2.,"'Whence came I what I am? Thou, Laon, knowest"

4354,CANTO 3.,"In dreary calmness round me, did I shun                              _1285"
4355,CANTO 3.,"Its presence, nor seek refuge with the dead"
4356,CANTO 3.,From one faint hope whose flower a dropping poison shed.
4357,CANTO 3.,
4358,CANTO 3.,21.
4359,CANTO 3.,Two days thus passed--I neither raved nor died--
4360,CANTO 3.,"Thirst raged within me, like a scorpion's nest"
4361,CANTO 3.,Built in mine entrails; I had spurned aside                          _1290
4362,CANTO 3.,"The water-vessel, while despair possessed"
4363,CANTO 3.,"My thoughts, and now no drop remained! The uprest"
4364,CANTO 3.,Of the third sun brought hunger--but the crust
4365,CANTO 3.,"Which had been left, was to my craving breast"
4366,CANTO 3.,"Fuel, not food. I chewed the bitter dust,                            _1295"
4367,CANTO 3.,"And bit my bloodless arm, and licked the brazen rust."
4368,CANTO 3.,
4369,CANTO 3.,22.
4370,CANTO 3.,My brain began to fail when the fourth morn
4371,CANTO 3.,"Burst o'er the golden isles--a fearful sleep,"
4372,CANTO 3.,Which through the caverns dreary and forlorn
4373,CANTO 3.,"Of the riven soul, sent its foul dreams to sweep                     _1300"
4374,CANTO 3.,"With whirlwind swiftness--a fall far and deep,--"
4375,CANTO 3.,"A gulf, a void, a sense of senselessness--"
4376,CANTO 3.,"These things dwelt in me, even as shadows keep"
4377,CANTO 3.,"Their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness,"
4378,CANTO 3.,"A shoreless sea, a sky sunless and planetless!                       _1305"
4379,CANTO 3.,
4380,CANTO 3.,23.
4381,CANTO 3.,The forms which peopled this terrific trance
4382,CANTO 3.,"I well remember--like a choir of devils,"
4383,CANTO 3.,Around me they involved a giddy dance;
4384,CANTO 3.,Legions seemed gathering from the misty levels
4385,CANTO 3.,"Of Ocean, to supply those ceaseless revels,                          _1310"
4386,CANTO 3.,"Foul, ceaseless shadows:--thought could not divide"
4387,CANTO 3.,"The actual world from these entangling evils,"
4388,CANTO 3.,"Which so bemocked themselves, that I descried"
4389,CANTO 3.,"All shapes like mine own self, hideously multiplied."
4390,CANTO 3.,
4391,CANTO 3.,24.
4392,CANTO 3.,"The sense of day and night, of false and true,                       _1315"
4393,CANTO 3.,Was dead within me. Yet two visions burst
4394,CANTO 3.,"That darkness--one, as since that hour I knew,"
4395,CANTO 3.,"Was not a phantom of the realms accursed,"
4396,CANTO 3.,Where then my spirit dwelt--but of the first
4397,CANTO 3.,"I know not yet, was it a dream or no.                                _1320"
4398,CANTO 3.,"But both, though not distincter, were immersed"
4399,CANTO 3.,"In hues which, when through memory's waste they flow,"
4400,CANTO 3.,Make their divided streams more bright and rapid now.
4401,CANTO 3.,
4402,CANTO 3.,25.
4403,CANTO 3.,"Methought that grate was lifted, and the seven"
4404,CANTO 3.,"Who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare,                      _1325"
4405,CANTO 3.,And from the frieze to the four winds of Heaven
4406,CANTO 3.,Hung them on high by the entangled hair;
4407,CANTO 3.,Swarthy were three--the fourth was very fair;
4408,CANTO 3.,"As they retired, the golden moon upsprung,"
4409,CANTO 3.,"And eagerly, out in the giddy air,                                   _1330"
4410,CANTO 3.,"Leaning that I might eat, I stretched and clung"
4411,CANTO 3.,Over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung.
4412,CANTO 3.,
4413,CANTO 3.,26.
4414,CANTO 3.,"A woman's shape, now lank and cold and blue,"
4415,CANTO 3.,"The dwelling of the many-coloured worm,"
4416,CANTO 3.,Hung there; the white and hollow cheek I drew                        _1335
4417,CANTO 3.,To my dry lips--what radiance did inform
4418,CANTO 3.,Those horny eyes? whose was that withered form?
4419,CANTO 3.,"Alas, alas! it seemed that Cythna's ghost"
4420,CANTO 3.,"Laughed in those looks, and that the flesh was warm"
4421,CANTO 3.,Within my teeth!--a whirlwind keen as frost                          _1340
4422,CANTO 3.,Then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed.
4423,CANTO 3.,
4424,CANTO 3.,27.
4425,CANTO 3.,Then seemed it that a tameless hurricane
4426,CANTO 3.,"Arose, and bore me in its dark career"
4427,CANTO 3.,"Beyond the sun, beyond the stars that wane"
4428,CANTO 3.,"On the verge of formless space--it languished there,                 _1345"
4429,CANTO 3.,"And dying, left a silence lone and drear,"
4430,CANTO 3.,More horrible than famine:--in the deep
4431,CANTO 3.,"The shape of an old man did then appear,"
4432,CANTO 3.,Stately and beautiful; that dreadful sleep
4433,CANTO 3.,"His heavenly smiles dispersed, and I could wake and weep.            _1350"
4434,CANTO 3.,
4435,CANTO 3.,28.
4436,CANTO 3.,"And, when the blinding tears had fallen, I saw"
4437,CANTO 3.,"That column, and those corpses, and the moon,"
4438,CANTO 3.,And felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw
4439,CANTO 3.,"My vitals, I rejoiced, as if the boon"
4440,CANTO 3.,Of senseless death would be accorded soon;--                         _1355
4441,CANTO 3.,"When from that stony gloom a voice arose,"
4442,CANTO 3.,Solemn and sweet as when low winds attune
4443,CANTO 3.,"The midnight pines; the grate did then unclose,"
4444,CANTO 3.,And on that reverend form the moonlight did repose.
4445,CANTO 3.,
4446,CANTO 3.,29.
4447,CANTO 3.,"He struck my chains, and gently spake and smiled;                    _1360"
4448,CANTO 3.,"As they were loosened by that Hermit old,"
4449,CANTO 3.,"Mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled,"
4450,CANTO 3.,To answer those kind looks; he did enfold
4451,CANTO 3.,"His giant arms around me, to uphold"
4452,CANTO 3.,My wretched frame; my scorched limbs he wound                        _1365
4453,CANTO 3.,"In linen moist and balmy, and as cold"
4454,CANTO 3.,"As dew to drooping leaves;--the chain, with sound"
4455,CANTO 3.,"Like earthquake, through the chasm of that steep stair did bound,"
4456,CANTO 3.,
4457,CANTO 3.,30.
4458,CANTO 3.,"As, lifting me, it fell!--What next I heard,"
4459,CANTO 3.,"Were billows leaping on the harbour-bar,                             _1370"
4460,CANTO 3.,"And the shrill sea-wind, whose breath idly stirred"
4461,CANTO 3.,"My hair;--I looked abroad, and saw a star"
4462,CANTO 3.,"Shining beside a sail, and distant far"
4463,CANTO 3.,"That mountain and its column, the known mark"
4464,CANTO 3.,"Of those who in the wide deep wandering are,                         _1375"
4465,CANTO 3.,"So that I feared some Spirit, fell and dark,"
4466,CANTO 3.,In trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark.
4467,CANTO 3.,
4468,CANTO 3.,31.
4469,CANTO 3.,"For now indeed, over the salt sea-billow"
4470,CANTO 3.,I sailed: yet dared not look upon the shape
4471,CANTO 3.,"Of him who ruled the helm, although the pillow                       _1380"
4472,CANTO 3.,"For my light head was hollowed in his lap,"
4473,CANTO 3.,"And my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap,"
4474,CANTO 3.,"Fearing it was a fiend: at last, he bent"
4475,CANTO 3.,O'er me his aged face; as if to snap
4476,CANTO 3.,"Those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent,                   _1385"
4477,CANTO 3.,And to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent.
4478,CANTO 3.,
4479,CANTO 3.,32.
4480,CANTO 3.,A soft and healing potion to my lips
4481,CANTO 3.,"At intervals he raised--now looked on high,"
4482,CANTO 3.,To mark if yet the starry giant dips
4483,CANTO 3.,"His zone in the dim sea--now cheeringly,                             _1390"
4484,CANTO 3.,"Though he said little, did he speak to me."
4485,CANTO 3.,"'It is a friend beside thee--take good cheer,"
4486,CANTO 3.,"Poor victim, thou art now at liberty!'"
4487,CANTO 3.,"I joyed as those a human tone to hear,"
4488,CANTO 3.,Who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year.              _1395
4489,CANTO 3.,
4490,CANTO 3.,33.
4491,CANTO 3.,"A dim and feeble joy, whose glimpses oft"
4492,CANTO 3.,Were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams;
4493,CANTO 3.,"Yet still methought we sailed, until aloft"
4494,CANTO 3.,"The stars of night grew pallid, and the beams"
4495,CANTO 3.,"Of morn descended on the ocean-streams,                              _1400"
4496,CANTO 3.,"And still that aged man, so grand and mild,"
4497,CANTO 3.,"Tended me, even as some sick mother seems"
4498,CANTO 3.,"To hang in hope over a dying child,"
4499,CANTO 3.,Till in the azure East darkness again was piled.
4500,CANTO 3.,
4501,CANTO 3.,34.
4502,CANTO 3.,"And then the night-wind steaming from the shore,                     _1405"
4503,CANTO 3.,"Sent odours dying sweet across the sea,"
4504,CANTO 3.,"And the swift boat the little waves which bore,"
4505,CANTO 3.,"Were cut by its keen keel, though slantingly;"
4506,CANTO 3.,"Soon I could hear the leaves sigh, and could see"
4507,CANTO 3.,"The myrtle-blossoms starring the dim grove,                          _1410"
4508,CANTO 3.,As past the pebbly beach the boat did flee
4509,CANTO 3.,"On sidelong wing, into a silent cove,"
4510,CANTO 3.,Where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove.

4521,CANTO 4.,"The old man took the oars, and soon the bark"
4522,CANTO 4.,Smote on the beach beside a tower of stone;                          _1415
4523,CANTO 4.,"It was a crumbling heap, whose portal dark"
4524,CANTO 4.,With blooming ivy-trails was overgrown;
4525,CANTO 4.,"Upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown,"
4526,CANTO 4.,"And rarest sea-shells, which the eternal flood,"
4527,CANTO 4.,"Slave to the mother of the months, had thrown                        _1420"
4528,CANTO 4.,"Within the walls of that gray tower, which stood"

4532,CANTO 4.,"When the old man his boat had anchored,"
4533,CANTO 4.,"He wound me in his arms with tender care,"
4534,CANTO 4.,"And very few, but kindly words he said,                              _1425"
4535,CANTO 4.,"And bore me through the tower adown a stair,"
4536,CANTO 4.,Whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear
4537,CANTO 4.,For many a year had fallen.--We came at last
4538,CANTO 4.,"To a small chamber, which with mosses rare"
4539,CANTO 4.,"Was tapestried, where me his soft hands placed                       _1430"

4541,CANTO 4.,

4543,CANTO 4.,The moon was darting through the lattices
4544,CANTO 4.,"Its yellow light, warm as the beams of day--"
4545,CANTO 4.,"So warm, that to admit the dewy breeze,"
4546,CANTO 4.,The old man opened them; the moonlight lay                           _1435
4547,CANTO 4.,Upon a lake whose waters wove their play
4548,CANTO 4.,Even to the threshold of that lonely home:
4549,CANTO 4.,Within was seen in the dim wavering ray
4550,CANTO 4.,"The antique sculptured roof, and many a tome"

4554,CANTO 4.,"The rock-built barrier of the sea was past,--"
4555,CANTO 4.,"And I was on the margin of a lake,"
4556,CANTO 4.,"A lonely lake, amid the forests vast"
4557,CANTO 4.,And snowy mountains:--did my spirit wake
4558,CANTO 4.,From sleep as many-coloured as the snake                             _1445
4559,CANTO 4.,"That girds eternity? in life and truth,"
4560,CANTO 4.,Might not my heart its cravings ever slake?
4561,CANTO 4.,"Was Cythna then a dream, and all my youth,"

4566,CANTO 4.,Which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow
4567,CANTO 4.,With supernatural shades of clinging sadness;
4568,CANTO 4.,"That gentle Hermit, in my helpless woe,"
4569,CANTO 4.,"By my sick couch was busy to and fro,"
4570,CANTO 4.,Like a strong spirit ministrant of good:                             _1455
4571,CANTO 4.,"When I was healed, he led me forth to show"

4576,CANTO 4.,He knew his soothing words to weave with skill
4577,CANTO 4.,"From all my madness told; like mine own heart,                       _1460"
4578,CANTO 4.,"Of Cythna would he question me, until"
4579,CANTO 4.,"That thrilling name had ceased to make me start,"
4580,CANTO 4.,"From his familiar lips--it was not art,"
4581,CANTO 4.,Of wisdom and of justice when he spoke--
4582,CANTO 4.,"When mid soft looks of pity, there would dart                        _1465"

4587,CANTO 4.,"Thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled,"

4589,CANTO 4.,Through the enchantments of that Hermit old;                         _1470
4590,CANTO 4.,Then I bethought me of the glorious doom
4591,CANTO 4.,Of those who sternly struggle to relume
4592,CANTO 4.,"The lamp of Hope o'er man's bewildered lot,"
4593,CANTO 4.,"And, sitting by the waters, in the gloom"

4599,CANTO 4.,"In converse with the dead, who leave the stamp"

4601,CANTO 4.,When they are gone into the senseless damp                           _1480
4602,CANTO 4.,Of graves;--his spirit thus became a lamp
4603,CANTO 4.,"Of splendour, like to those on which it fed;"
4604,CANTO 4.,"Through peopled haunts, the City and the Camp,"
4605,CANTO 4.,"Deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led,"
4606,CANTO 4.,And all the ways of men among mankind he read.                       _1485

4608,CANTO 4.,9.
4609,CANTO 4.,But custom maketh blind and obdurate
4610,CANTO 4.,The loftiest hearts;--he had beheld the woe
4611,CANTO 4.,"In which mankind was bound, but deemed that fate"
4612,CANTO 4.,"Which made them abject, would preserve them so;"
4613,CANTO 4.,"And in such faith, some steadfast joy to know,                       _1490"
4614,CANTO 4.,He sought this cell: but when fame went abroad
4615,CANTO 4.,That one in Argolis did undergo
4616,CANTO 4.,"Torture for liberty, and that the crowd"
4617,CANTO 4.,High truths from gifted lips had heard and understood;
4618,CANTO 4.,
4619,CANTO 4.,10.
4620,CANTO 4.,"And that the multitude was gathering wide,--                         _1495"
4621,CANTO 4.,His spirit leaped within his aged frame;
4622,CANTO 4.,"In lonely peace he could no more abide,"

4624,CANTO 4.,"Had fed, my native land, the Hermit came:"
4625,CANTO 4.,"Each heart was there a shield, and every tongue                      _1500"
4626,CANTO 4.,Was as a sword of truth--young Laon's name
4627,CANTO 4.,"Rallied their secret hopes, though tyrants sung"

4633,CANTO 4.,"The hearts of those who watched it did unlock,"

4973,CANTO 5.,Descends like night--when 'Laon!' one did cry;
4974,CANTO 5.,Like a bright ghost from Heaven that shout did scare                 _1780
4975,CANTO 5.,"The slaves, and widening through the vaulted sky,"
4976,CANTO 5.,Seemed sent from Earth to Heaven in sign of victory.
4977,CANTO 5.,
4978,CANTO 5.,8.
4979,CANTO 5.,"In sudden panic those false murderers fled,"
4980,CANTO 5.,Like insect tribes before the northern gale:
4981,CANTO 5.,"But swifter still, our hosts encompassed                             _1785"
4982,CANTO 5.,"Their shattered ranks, and in a craggy vale,"
4983,CANTO 5.,"Where even their fierce despair might nought avail,"
4984,CANTO 5.,Hemmed them around!--and then revenge and fear
4985,CANTO 5.,Made the high virtue of the patriots fail:
4986,CANTO 5.,One pointed on his foe the mortal spear--                            _1790
4987,CANTO 5.,"I rushed before its point, and cried 'Forbear, forbear!'"
4988,CANTO 5.,
4989,CANTO 5.,9.
4990,CANTO 5.,The spear transfixed my arm that was uplifted
4991,CANTO 5.,"In swift expostulation, and the blood"
4992,CANTO 5.,"Gushed round its point: I smiled, and--'Oh! thou gifted"
4993,CANTO 5.,"With eloquence which shall not be withstood,                         _1795"
4994,CANTO 5.,"Flow thus!' I cried in joy, 'thou vital flood,"
4995,CANTO 5.,"Until my heart be dry, ere thus the cause"
4996,CANTO 5.,For which thou wert aught worthy be subdued--
4997,CANTO 5.,"Ah, ye are pale,--ye weep,--your passions pause,--"
4998,CANTO 5.,'Tis well! ye feel the truth of love's benignant laws.               _1800
4999,CANTO 5.,
5000,CANTO 5.,10.
5001,CANTO 5.,"'Soldiers, our brethren and our friends are slain."
5002,CANTO 5.,"Ye murdered them, I think, as they did sleep!"
5003,CANTO 5.,"Alas, what have ye done? the slightest pain"
5004,CANTO 5.,"Which ye might suffer, there were eyes to weep,"
5005,CANTO 5.,But ye have quenched them--there were smiles to steep                _1805
5006,CANTO 5.,"Your hearts in balm, but they are lost in woe;"
5007,CANTO 5.,And those whom love did set his watch to keep
5008,CANTO 5.,"Around your tents, truth's freedom to bestow,"
5009,CANTO 5.,Ye stabbed as they did sleep--but they forgive ye now.
5010,CANTO 5.,
5011,CANTO 5.,11.
5012,CANTO 5.,"'Oh wherefore should ill ever flow from ill,                         _1810"
5013,CANTO 5.,And pain still keener pain for ever breed?
5014,CANTO 5.,We all are brethren--even the slaves who kill
5015,CANTO 5.,"For hire, are men; and to avenge misdeed"
5016,CANTO 5.,"On the misdoer, doth but Misery feed"
5017,CANTO 5.,"With her own broken heart! O Earth, O Heaven!                        _1815"
5018,CANTO 5.,"And thou, dread Nature, which to every deed"
5019,CANTO 5.,"And all that lives, or is, to be hath given,"
5020,CANTO 5.,"Even as to thee have these done ill, and are forgiven!"
5021,CANTO 5.,
5022,CANTO 5.,12.
5023,CANTO 5.,"'Join then your hands and hearts, and let the past"
5024,CANTO 5.,Be as a grave which gives not up its dead                            _1820
5025,CANTO 5.,To evil thoughts.'--A film then overcast
5026,CANTO 5.,"My sense with dimness, for the wound, which bled"
5027,CANTO 5.,"Freshly, swift shadows o'er mine eyes had shed."
5028,CANTO 5.,"When I awoke, I lay mid friends and foes,"
5029,CANTO 5.,And earnest countenances on me shed                                  _1825
5030,CANTO 5.,"The light of questioning looks, whilst one did close"
5031,CANTO 5.,"My wound with balmiest herbs, and soothed me to repose;"
5032,CANTO 5.,
5033,CANTO 5.,13.
5034,CANTO 5.,"And one whose spear had pierced me, leaned beside"
5035,CANTO 5.,With quivering lips and humid eyes;--and all
5036,CANTO 5.,Seemed like some brothers on a journey wide                          _1830
5037,CANTO 5.,"Gone forth, whom now strange meeting did befall"
5038,CANTO 5.,"In a strange land, round one whom they might call"
5039,CANTO 5.,"Their friend, their chief, their father, for assay"
5040,CANTO 5.,"Of peril, which had saved them from the thrall"
5041,CANTO 5.,"Of death, now suffering. Thus the vast array                         _1835"
5042,CANTO 5.,Of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day.
5043,CANTO 5.,
5044,CANTO 5.,14.
5045,CANTO 5.,"Lifting the thunder of their acclamation,"
5046,CANTO 5.,"Towards the City then the multitude,"
5047,CANTO 5.,"And I among them, went in joy--a nation"
5048,CANTO 5.,Made free by love;--a mighty brotherhood                             _1840
5049,CANTO 5.,Linked by a jealous interchange of good;
5050,CANTO 5.,"A glorious pageant, more magnificent"
5051,CANTO 5.,"Than kingly slaves arrayed in gold and blood,"
5052,CANTO 5.,"When they return from carnage, and are sent"
5053,CANTO 5.,In triumph bright beneath the populous battlement.                   _1845
5054,CANTO 5.,
5055,CANTO 5.,15.
5056,CANTO 5.,"Afar, the city-walls were thronged on high,"
5057,CANTO 5.,"And myriads on each giddy turret clung,"
5058,CANTO 5.,And to each spire far lessening in the sky
5059,CANTO 5.,Bright pennons on the idle winds were hung;
5060,CANTO 5.,"As we approached, a shout of joyance sprung                          _1850"
5061,CANTO 5.,"At once from all the crowd, as if the vast"
5062,CANTO 5.,And peopled Earth its boundless skies among
5063,CANTO 5.,"The sudden clamour of delight had cast,"
5064,CANTO 5.,When from before its face some general wreck had passed.
5065,CANTO 5.,
5066,CANTO 5.,16.
5067,CANTO 5.,Our armies through the City's hundred gates                          _1855
5068,CANTO 5.,"Were poured, like brooks which to the rocky lair"
5069,CANTO 5.,"Of some deep lake, whose silence them awaits,"
5070,CANTO 5.,Throng from the mountains when the storms are there
5071,CANTO 5.,"And, as we passed through the calm sunny air"
5072,CANTO 5.,"A thousand flower-inwoven crowns were shed,                          _1860"
5073,CANTO 5.,"The token flowers of truth and freedom fair,"
5074,CANTO 5.,"And fairest hands bound them on many a head,"
5075,CANTO 5.,Those angels of love's heaven that over all was spread.
5076,CANTO 5.,
5077,CANTO 5.,17.
5078,CANTO 5.,I trod as one tranced in some rapturous vision:
5079,CANTO 5.,"Those bloody bands so lately reconciled,                             _1865"
5080,CANTO 5.,"Were, ever as they went, by the contrition"
5081,CANTO 5.,"Of anger turned to love, from ill beguiled,"
5082,CANTO 5.,"And every one on them more gently smiled,"
5083,CANTO 5.,Because they had done evil:--the sweet awe
5084,CANTO 5.,"Of such mild looks made their own hearts grow mild,                  _1870"
5085,CANTO 5.,And did with soft attraction ever draw
5086,CANTO 5.,Their spirits to the love of freedom's equal law.
5087,CANTO 5.,
5088,CANTO 5.,18.
5089,CANTO 5.,"And they, and all, in one loud symphony"
5090,CANTO 5.,"My name with Liberty commingling, lifted,"
5091,CANTO 5.,'The friend and the preserver of the free!                           _1875
5092,CANTO 5.,The parent of this joy!' and fair eyes gifted
5093,CANTO 5.,"With feelings, caught from one who had uplifted"
5094,CANTO 5.,"The light of a great spirit, round me shone;"
5095,CANTO 5.,And all the shapes of this grand scenery shifted
5096,CANTO 5.,"Like restless clouds before the steadfast sun,--                     _1880"
5097,CANTO 5.,"Where was that Maid? I asked, but it was known of none."
5098,CANTO 5.,
5099,CANTO 5.,19.
5100,CANTO 5.,"Laone was the name her love had chosen,"
5101,CANTO 5.,"For she was nameless, and her birth none knew:"
5102,CANTO 5.,Where was Laone now?--The words were frozen
5103,CANTO 5.,Within my lips with fear; but to subdue                              _1885
5104,CANTO 5.,"Such dreadful hope, to my great task was due,"
5105,CANTO 5.,"And when at length one brought reply, that she"
5106,CANTO 5.,"To-morrow would appear, I then withdrew"
5107,CANTO 5.,"To judge what need for that great throng might be,"
5108,CANTO 5.,For now the stars came thick over the twilight sea.                  _1890
5109,CANTO 5.,
5110,CANTO 5.,20.
5111,CANTO 5.,"Yet need was none for rest or food to care,"
5112,CANTO 5.,"Even though that multitude was passing great,"
5113,CANTO 5.,Since each one for the other did prepare
5114,CANTO 5.,All kindly succour--Therefore to the gate
5115,CANTO 5.,"Of the Imperial House, now desolate,                                 _1895"
5116,CANTO 5.,"I passed, and there was found aghast, alone,"
5117,CANTO 5.,The fallen Tyrant!--Silently he sate
5118,CANTO 5.,"Upon the footstool of his golden throne,"
5119,CANTO 5.,"Which, starred with sunny gems, in its own lustre shone."
5120,CANTO 5.,
5121,CANTO 5.,21.
5122,CANTO 5.,"Alone, but for one child, who led before him                         _1900"
5123,CANTO 5.,A graceful dance: the only living thing
5124,CANTO 5.,"Of all the crowd, which thither to adore him"
5125,CANTO 5.,"Flocked yesterday, who solace sought to bring"
5126,CANTO 5.,In his abandonment!--She knew the King
5127,CANTO 5.,"Had praised her dance of yore, and now she wove                      _1905"
5128,CANTO 5.,"Its circles, aye weeping and murmuring"
5129,CANTO 5.,"Mid her sad task of unregarded love,"
5130,CANTO 5.,That to no smiles it might his speechless sadness move.
5131,CANTO 5.,
5132,CANTO 5.,22.
5133,CANTO 5.,"She fled to him, and wildly clasped his feet"
5134,CANTO 5.,"When human steps were heard:--he moved nor spoke,                    _1910"
5135,CANTO 5.,"Nor changed his hue, nor raised his looks to meet"
5136,CANTO 5.,The gaze of strangers--our loud entrance woke
5137,CANTO 5.,"The echoes of the hall, which circling broke"
5138,CANTO 5.,"The calm of its recesses,--like a tomb"
5139,CANTO 5.,Its sculptured walls vacantly to the stroke                          _1915
5140,CANTO 5.,"Of footfalls answered, and the twilight's gloom"
5141,CANTO 5.,Lay like a charnel's mist within the radiant dome.
5142,CANTO 5.,
5143,CANTO 5.,23.
5144,CANTO 5.,The little child stood up when we came nigh;
5145,CANTO 5.,"Her lips and cheeks seemed very pale and wan,"
5146,CANTO 5.,"But on her forehead, and within her eye                              _1920"
5147,CANTO 5.,"Lay beauty, which makes hearts that feed thereon"
5148,CANTO 5.,Sick with excess of sweetness; on the throne
5149,CANTO 5.,"She leaned;--the King, with gathered brow, and lips"
5150,CANTO 5.,"Wreathed by long scorn, did inly sneer and frown"
5151,CANTO 5.,With hue like that when some great painter dips                      _1925
5152,CANTO 5.,His pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse.
5153,CANTO 5.,
5154,CANTO 5.,24.
5155,CANTO 5.,She stood beside him like a rainbow braided
5156,CANTO 5.,"Within some storm, when scarce its shadows vast"
5157,CANTO 5.,From the blue paths of the swift sun have faded;
5158,CANTO 5.,"A sweet and solemn smile, like Cythna's, cast                        _1930"
5159,CANTO 5.,"One moment's light, which made my heart beat fast,"
5160,CANTO 5.,"O'er that child's parted lips--a gleam of bliss,"
5161,CANTO 5.,"A shade of vanished days,--as the tears passed"
5162,CANTO 5.,"Which wrapped it, even as with a father's kiss"
5163,CANTO 5.,I pressed those softest eyes in trembling tenderness.                _1935
5164,CANTO 5.,
5165,CANTO 5.,25.
5166,CANTO 5.,The sceptred wretch then from that solitude
5167,CANTO 5.,"I drew, and, of his change compassionate,"
5168,CANTO 5.,With words of sadness soothed his rugged mood.
5169,CANTO 5.,"But he, while pride and fear held deep debate,"
5170,CANTO 5.,With sullen guile of ill-dissembled hate                             _1940
5171,CANTO 5.,Glared on me as a toothless snake might glare:
5172,CANTO 5.,"Pity, not scorn I felt, though desolate"
5173,CANTO 5.,"The desolator now, and unaware"
5174,CANTO 5.,The curses which he mocked had caught him by the hair.
5175,CANTO 5.,
5176,CANTO 5.,26.
5177,CANTO 5.,I led him forth from that which now might seem                       _1945
5178,CANTO 5.,A gorgeous grave: through portals sculptured deep
5179,CANTO 5.,With imagery beautiful as dream
5180,CANTO 5.,"We went, and left the shades which tend on sleep"
5181,CANTO 5.,Over its unregarded gold to keep
5182,CANTO 5.,"Their silent watch.--The child trod faintingly,                      _1950"
5183,CANTO 5.,"And as she went, the tears which she did weep"
5184,CANTO 5.,"Glanced in the starlight; wildered seemed she,"
5185,CANTO 5.,"And, when I spake, for sobs she could not answer me."
5186,CANTO 5.,
5187,CANTO 5.,27.
5188,CANTO 5.,"At last the tyrant cried, 'She hungers, slave!"
5189,CANTO 5.,"Stab her, or give her bread!'--It was a tone                         _1955"
5190,CANTO 5.,Such as sick fancies in a new-made grave
5191,CANTO 5.,"Might hear. I trembled, for the truth was known;"
5192,CANTO 5.,"He with this child had thus been left alone,"
5193,CANTO 5.,"And neither had gone forth for food,--but he"
5194,CANTO 5.,"In mingled pride and awe cowered near his throne,                    _1960"
5195,CANTO 5.,And she a nursling of captivity
5196,CANTO 5.,"Knew nought beyond those walls, nor what such change might be."
5197,CANTO 5.,
5198,CANTO 5.,28.
5199,CANTO 5.,And he was troubled at a charm withdrawn
5200,CANTO 5.,Thus suddenly; that sceptres ruled no more--
5201,CANTO 5.,"That even from gold the dreadful strength was gone,                  _1965"
5202,CANTO 5.,Which once made all things subject to its power--
5203,CANTO 5.,"Such wonder seized him, as if hour by hour"
5204,CANTO 5.,The past had come again; and the swift fall
5205,CANTO 5.,"Of one so great and terrible of yore,"
5206,CANTO 5.,"To desolateness, in the hearts of all                                _1970"
5207,CANTO 5.,"Like wonder stirred, who saw such awful change befall."
5208,CANTO 5.,
5209,CANTO 5.,29.
5210,CANTO 5.,"A mighty crowd, such as the wide land pours"
5211,CANTO 5.,"Once in a thousand years, now gathered round"
5212,CANTO 5.,The fallen tyrant;--like the rush of showers
5213,CANTO 5.,"Of hail in spring, pattering along the ground,                       _1975"
5214,CANTO 5.,"Their many footsteps fell, else came no sound"
5215,CANTO 5.,From the wide multitude: that lonely man
5216,CANTO 5.,"Then knew the burden of his change, and found,"
5217,CANTO 5.,"Concealing in the dust his visage wan,"
5218,CANTO 5.,Refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran.              _1980
5219,CANTO 5.,
5220,CANTO 5.,30.
5221,CANTO 5.,And he was faint withal: I sate beside him
5222,CANTO 5.,"Upon the earth, and took that child so fair"
5223,CANTO 5.,"From his weak arms, that ill might none betide him"
5224,CANTO 5.,"Or her;--when food was brought to them, her share"
5225,CANTO 5.,"To his averted lips the child did bear,                              _1985"
5226,CANTO 5.,"But, when she saw he had enough, she ate"
5227,CANTO 5.,And wept the while;--the lonely man's despair
5228,CANTO 5.,"Hunger then overcame, and of his state"
5229,CANTO 5.,"Forgetful, on the dust as in a trance he sate."
5230,CANTO 5.,
5231,CANTO 5.,31.
5232,CANTO 5.,Slowly the silence of the multitudes                                 _1990
5233,CANTO 5.,"Passed, as when far is heard in some lone dell"
5234,CANTO 5.,The gathering of a wind among the woods--
5235,CANTO 5.,"'And he is fallen!' they cry, 'he who did dwell"
5236,CANTO 5.,"Like famine or the plague, or aught more fell"
5237,CANTO 5.,"Among our homes, is fallen! the murderer                             _1995"
5238,CANTO 5.,Who slaked his thirsting soul as from a well
5239,CANTO 5.,Of blood and tears with ruin! he is here!
5240,CANTO 5.,Sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear!'
5241,CANTO 5.,
5242,CANTO 5.,32.
5243,CANTO 5.,Then was heard--'He who judged let him be brought
5244,CANTO 5.,To judgement! blood for blood cries from the soil                    _2000
5245,CANTO 5.,On which his crimes have deep pollution wrought!
5246,CANTO 5.,Shall Othman only unavenged despoil?
5247,CANTO 5.,Shall they who by the stress of grinding toil
5248,CANTO 5.,"Wrest from the unwilling earth his luxuries,"
5249,CANTO 5.,"Perish for crime, while his foul blood may boil,                     _2005"
5250,CANTO 5.,Or creep within his veins at will?--Arise!
5251,CANTO 5.,And to high justice make her chosen sacrifice!'
5252,CANTO 5.,
5253,CANTO 5.,33.
5254,CANTO 5.,"'What do ye seek? what fear ye,' then I cried,"
5255,CANTO 5.,"Suddenly starting forth, 'that ye should shed"
5256,CANTO 5.,The blood of Othman?--if your hearts are tried                       _2010
5257,CANTO 5.,"In the true love of freedom, cease to dread"
5258,CANTO 5.,This one poor lonely man--beneath Heaven spread
5259,CANTO 5.,"In purest light above us all, through earth--"
5260,CANTO 5.,"Maternal earth, who doth her sweet smiles shed"
5261,CANTO 5.,"For all, let him go free; until the worth                            _2015"

5263,CANTO 5.,
5264,CANTO 5.,34.
5265,CANTO 5.,"'What call ye ""justice""? Is there one who ne'er"
5266,CANTO 5.,In secret thought has wished another's ill?--

5268,CANTO 5.,"And tremble not. Shall they insult and kill,                         _2020"
5269,CANTO 5.,If such they be? their mild eyes can they fill
5270,CANTO 5.,With the false anger of the hypocrite?
5271,CANTO 5.,"Alas, such were not pure!--the chastened will"

5274,CANTO 5.,
5275,CANTO 5.,35.
5276,CANTO 5.,"The murmur of the people, slowly dying,"
5277,CANTO 5.,"Paused as I spake, then those who near me were,"

5279,CANTO 5.,"Shrouding his head, which now that infant fair"
5280,CANTO 5.,Clasped on her lap in silence;--through the air                      _2030
5281,CANTO 5.,"Sobs were then heard, and many kissed my feet"
5282,CANTO 5.,"In pity's madness, and to the despair"

5287,CANTO 5.,"Then to a home for his repose assigned,                              _2035"
5288,CANTO 5.,"Accompanied by the still throng, he went"
5289,CANTO 5.,"In silence, where, to soothe his rankling mind,"
5290,CANTO 5.,Some likeness of his ancient state was lent;
5291,CANTO 5.,And if his heart could have been innocent
5292,CANTO 5.,"As those who pardoned him, he might have ended                       _2040"
5293,CANTO 5.,"His days in peace; but his straight lips were bent,"
5294,CANTO 5.,"Men said, into a smile which guile portended,"
5295,CANTO 5.,A sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended.

5297,CANTO 5.,37.
5298,CANTO 5.,"'Twas midnight now, the eve of that great day"

5305,CANTO 5.,"Laone to my thoughts, with hopes that make"

5313,CANTO 5.,I went:--it was a sight which might avail
5314,CANTO 5.,"To make men weep exulting tears, for whom"
5315,CANTO 5.,Now first from human power the reverend veil

5318,CANTO 5.,
5319,CANTO 5.,39.
5320,CANTO 5.,"To see, far glancing in the misty morning,"
5321,CANTO 5.,The signs of that innumerable host;

5335,CANTO 5.,Sudden as when the moonrise makes appear                             _2075
5336,CANTO 5.,Strange clouds in the east; a marble pyramid
5337,CANTO 5.,Distinct with steps: that mighty shape did wear
5338,CANTO 5.,The light of genius; its still shadow hid
5339,CANTO 5.,Far ships: to know its height the morning mists forbid!
5340,CANTO 5.,
5341,CANTO 5.,41.
5342,CANTO 5.,To hear the restless multitudes for ever                             _2080
5343,CANTO 5.,"Around the base of that great Altar flow,"
5344,CANTO 5.,As on some mountain-islet burst and shiver
5345,CANTO 5.,Atlantic waves; and solemnly and slow
5346,CANTO 5.,"As the wind bore that tumult to and fro,"
5347,CANTO 5.,"To feel the dreamlike music, which did swim                          _2085"
5348,CANTO 5.,Like beams through floating clouds on waves below
5349,CANTO 5.,"Falling in pauses, from that Altar dim,"
5350,CANTO 5.,As silver-sounding tongues breathed an aerial hymn.

5352,CANTO 5.,42.
5353,CANTO 5.,"To hear, to see, to live, was on that morn"

5355,CANTO 5.,Cast off their memories of the past outworn;
5356,CANTO 5.,"Two only bosoms with their own life trembled,"

5363,CANTO 5.,43.
5364,CANTO 5.,To the great Pyramid I came: its stair
5365,CANTO 5.,With female choirs was thronged: the loveliest

5367,CANTO 5.,"As I approached, the morning's golden mist,"
5368,CANTO 5.,Which now the wonder-stricken breezes kissed
5369,CANTO 5.,"With their cold lips, fled, and the summit shone"
5370,CANTO 5.,"Like Athos seen from Samothracia, dressed"
5371,CANTO 5.,"In earliest light, by vintagers, and one                             _2105"

5373,CANTO 5.,

5375,CANTO 5.,A Form most like the imagined habitant
5376,CANTO 5.,"Of silver exhalations sprung from dawn,"
5377,CANTO 5.,"By winds which feed on sunrise woven, to enchant"
5378,CANTO 5.,"The faiths of men: all mortal eyes were drawn,                       _2110"
5379,CANTO 5.,As famished mariners through strange seas gone

5382,CANTO 5.,"With thoughts which none could share, from that fair sight"

5385,CANTO 5.,45.
5386,CANTO 5.,"And neither did I hear the acclamations,"
5387,CANTO 5.,"Which from brief silence bursting, filled the air"
5388,CANTO 5.,"With her strange name and mine, from all the nations"
5389,CANTO 5.,"Which we, they said, in strength had gathered there"
5390,CANTO 5.,From the sleep of bondage; nor the vision fair                       _2120
5391,CANTO 5.,"Of that bright pageantry beheld,--but blind"
5392,CANTO 5.,"And silent, as a breathing corpse did fare,"
5393,CANTO 5.,"Leaning upon my friend, till like a wind"

5395,CANTO 5.,
5396,CANTO 5.,46.
5397,CANTO 5.,"Like music of some minstrel heavenly gifted,                         _2125"

5399,CANTO 5.,"Scarce did I wish her veil to be uplifted,"

5406,CANTO 5.,
5407,CANTO 5.,47.
5408,CANTO 5.,At first Laone spoke most tremulously:

5419,CANTO 5.,'For this wilt thou not henceforth pardon me?

5441,CANTO 5.,A Woman sitting on the sculptured disk

5443,CANTO 5.,A human babe and a young basilisk;
5444,CANTO 5.,Her looks were sweet as Heaven's when loveliest

5582,CANTO 5.,"In the shadow of the shores; as dead leaves wake,"

5584,CANTO 5.,"Those green depths beautiful when skies are blue,"
5585,CANTO 5.,The multitude so moveless did partake
5586,CANTO 5.,"Such living change, and kindling murmurs flew"
5587,CANTO 5.,As o'er that speechless calm delight and wonder grew.
5588,CANTO 5.,
5589,CANTO 5.,54.
5590,CANTO 5.,Over the plain the throngs were scattered then                       _2290
5591,CANTO 5.,"In groups around the fires, which from the sea"
5592,CANTO 5.,Even to the gorge of the first mountain-glen
5593,CANTO 5.,Blazed wide and far: the banquet of the free
5594,CANTO 5.,"Was spread beneath many a dark cypress-tree,"
5595,CANTO 5.,"Beneath whose spires, which swayed in the red flame,                 _2295"
5596,CANTO 5.,"Reclining, as they ate, of Liberty,"
5597,CANTO 5.,"And Hope, and Justice, and Laone's name,"
5598,CANTO 5.,Earth's children did a woof of happy converse frame.
5599,CANTO 5.,
5600,CANTO 5.,55.
5601,CANTO 5.,"Their feast was such as Earth, the general mother,"
5602,CANTO 5.,"Pours from her fairest bosom, when she smiles                        _2300"
5603,CANTO 5.,In the embrace of Autumn;--to each other
5604,CANTO 5.,As when some parent fondly reconciles
5605,CANTO 5.,"Her warring children, she their wrath beguiles"
5606,CANTO 5.,"With her own sustenance, they relenting weep:"
5607,CANTO 5.,"Such was this Festival, which from their isles                       _2305"
5608,CANTO 5.,"And continents, and winds, and oceans deep,"

5611,CANTO 5.,56.
5612,CANTO 5.,"Might share in peace and innocence, for gore"
5613,CANTO 5.,"Or poison none this festal did pollute,"
5614,CANTO 5.,"But, piled on high, an overflowing store                             _2310"
5615,CANTO 5.,"Of pomegranates and citrons, fairest fruit,"
5616,CANTO 5.,"Melons, and dates, and figs, and many a root"
5617,CANTO 5.,"Sweet and sustaining, and bright grapes ere yet"
5618,CANTO 5.,Accursed fire their mild juice could transmute
5619,CANTO 5.,"Into a mortal bane, and brown corn set                               _2315"
5620,CANTO 5.,In baskets; with pure streams their thirsting lips they wet.
5621,CANTO 5.,
5622,CANTO 5.,57.
5623,CANTO 5.,"Laone had descended from the shrine,"
5624,CANTO 5.,And every deepest look and holiest mind
5625,CANTO 5.,"Fed on her form, though now those tones divine"
5626,CANTO 5.,Were silent as she passed; she did unwind                            _2320
5627,CANTO 5.,"Her veil, as with the crowds of her own kind"
5628,CANTO 5.,She mixed; some impulse made my heart refrain
5629,CANTO 5.,"From seeking her that night, so I reclined"
5630,CANTO 5.,"Amidst a group, where on the utmost plain"
5631,CANTO 5.,A festal watchfire burned beside the dusky main.                     _2325
5632,CANTO 5.,
5633,CANTO 5.,58.
5634,CANTO 5.,"And joyous was our feast; pathetic talk,"
5635,CANTO 5.,"And wit, and harmony of choral strains,"
5636,CANTO 5.,While far Orion o'er the waves did walk
5637,CANTO 5.,"That flow among the isles, held us in chains"
5638,CANTO 5.,Of sweet captivity which none disdains                               _2330
5639,CANTO 5.,Who feels; but when his zone grew dim in mist
5640,CANTO 5.,"Which clothes the Ocean's bosom, o'er the plains"
5641,CANTO 5.,"The multitudes went homeward, to their rest,"
5642,CANTO 5.,Which that delightful day with its own shadow blessed.

5741,CANTO 6.,"Although unarmed, a steadfast front, and still"

5744,CANTO 6.,With doubt even in success; deliberate will
5745,CANTO 6.,Inspired our growing troop; not overthrown
5746,CANTO 6.,"It gained the shelter of a grassy hill,"
5747,CANTO 6.,"And ever still our comrades were hewn down,"
5748,CANTO 6.,And their defenceless limbs beneath our footsteps strown.            _2415

5756,CANTO 6.,"And my young friend was near, and ardently"
5757,CANTO 6.,His hand grasped mine a moment--now the line
5758,CANTO 6.,"Of war extended, to our rallying cry"
5759,CANTO 6.,As myriads flocked in love and brotherhood to die.
5760,CANTO 6.,

5765,CANTO 6.,"Too near, those slaves were swiftly overthrown"
5766,CANTO 6.,By hundreds leaping on them:--flesh and bone
5767,CANTO 6.,Soon made our ghastly ramparts; then the shaft                       _2430
5768,CANTO 6.,Of the artillery from the sea was thrown
5769,CANTO 6.,"More fast and fiery, and the conquerors laughed"

5771,CANTO 6.,
5772,CANTO 6.,12.
5773,CANTO 6.,"For on one side alone the hill gave shelter,"
5774,CANTO 6.,"So vast that phalanx of unconquered men,                             _2435"
5775,CANTO 6.,And there the living in the blood did welter
5776,CANTO 6.,"Of the dead and dying, which in that green glen,"
5777,CANTO 6.,"Like stifled torrents, made a plashy fen"
5778,CANTO 6.,Under the feet--thus was the butchery waged
5779,CANTO 6.,While the sun clomb Heaven's eastern steep--but when                 _2440

5782,CANTO 6.,
5783,CANTO 6.,13.
5784,CANTO 6.,Within a cave upon the hill were found
5785,CANTO 6.,"A bundle of rude pikes, the instrument"
5786,CANTO 6.,Of those who war but on their native ground                          _2445
5787,CANTO 6.,For natural rights: a shout of joyance sent
5788,CANTO 6.,"Even from our hearts the wide air pierced and rent,"
5789,CANTO 6.,As those few arms the bravest and the best
5790,CANTO 6.,"Seized, and each sixth, thus armed, did now present"
5791,CANTO 6.,"A line which covered and sustained the rest,                         _2450"
5792,CANTO 6.,"A confident phalanx, which the foes on every side invest."
5793,CANTO 6.,
5794,CANTO 6.,14.
5795,CANTO 6.,That onset turned the foes to flight almost;
5796,CANTO 6.,"But soon they saw their present strength, and knew"
5797,CANTO 6.,That coming night would to our resolute host
5798,CANTO 6.,"Bring victory; so dismounting, close they drew                       _2455"
5799,CANTO 6.,"Their glittering files, and then the combat grew"
5800,CANTO 6.,Unequal but most horrible;--and ever
5801,CANTO 6.,"Our myriads, whom the swift bolt overthrew,"
5802,CANTO 6.,"Or the red sword, failed like a mountain river"

5811,CANTO 6.,Was stabbed!--my old preserver's hoary hair
5812,CANTO 6.,"With the flesh clinging to its roots, was strewed"
5813,CANTO 6.,"Under my feet!--I lost all sense or care,"
5814,CANTO 6.,And like the rest I grew desperate and unaware.
5815,CANTO 6.,
5816,CANTO 6.,16.
5817,CANTO 6.,The battle became ghastlier--in the midst                            _2470
5818,CANTO 6.,"I paused, and saw, how ugly and how fell"
5819,CANTO 6.,"O Hate! thou art, even when thy life thou shedd'st"
5820,CANTO 6.,For love. The ground in many a little dell
5821,CANTO 6.,"Was broken, up and down whose steeps befell"

5823,CANTO 6.,The combatants with rage most horrible
5824,CANTO 6.,"Strove, and their eyes started with cracking stare,"

5826,CANTO 6.,
5827,CANTO 6.,17.
5828,CANTO 6.,"Flaccid and foamy, like a mad dog's hanging;"

5830,CANTO 6.,When its shafts smite--while yet its bow is twanging--
5831,CANTO 6.,Have each their mark and sign--some ghastly stain;
5832,CANTO 6.,"And this was thine, O War! of hate and pain"
5833,CANTO 6.,Thou loathed slave! I saw all shapes of death
5834,CANTO 6.,"And ministered to many, o'er the plain                               _2485"
5835,CANTO 6.,"While carnage in the sunbeam's warmth did seethe,"
5836,CANTO 6.,Till twilight o'er the east wove her serenest wreath.

5838,CANTO 6.,18.
5839,CANTO 6.,"The few who yet survived, resolute and firm"
5840,CANTO 6.,Around me fought. At the decline of day
5841,CANTO 6.,Winding above the mountain's snowy term                              _2490
5842,CANTO 6.,New banners shone; they quivered in the ray
5843,CANTO 6.,Of the sun's unseen orb--ere night the array
5844,CANTO 6.,Of fresh troops hemmed us in--of those brave bands
5845,CANTO 6.,I soon survived alone--and now I lay
5846,CANTO 6.,"Vanquished and faint, the grasp of bloody hands                      _2495"
5847,CANTO 6.,"I felt, and saw on high the glare of falling brands,"
5848,CANTO 6.,

5850,CANTO 6.,"When on my foes a sudden terror came,"

5852,CANTO 6.,A black Tartarian horse of giant frame
5853,CANTO 6.,"Comes trampling over the dead, the living bleed                      _2500"
5854,CANTO 6.,"Beneath the hoofs of that tremendous steed,"
5855,CANTO 6.,"On which, like to an Angel, robed in white,"
5856,CANTO 6.,Sate one waving a sword;--the hosts recede
5857,CANTO 6.,"And fly, as through their ranks with awful might,"
5858,CANTO 6.,Sweeps in the shadow of eve that Phantom swift and bright;           _2505
5859,CANTO 6.,
5860,CANTO 6.,20.
5861,CANTO 6.,And its path made a solitude.--I rose
5862,CANTO 6.,And marked its coming: it relaxed its course
5863,CANTO 6.,"As it approached me, and the wind that flows"
5864,CANTO 6.,"Through night, bore accents to mine ear whose force"
5865,CANTO 6.,Might create smiles in death--the Tartar horse                       _2510
5866,CANTO 6.,"Paused, and I saw the shape its might which swayed,"
5867,CANTO 6.,"And heard her musical pants, like the sweet source"
5868,CANTO 6.,"Of waters in the desert, as she said,"
5869,CANTO 6.,"'Mount with me, Laon, now'--I rapidly obeyed."
5870,CANTO 6.,
5871,CANTO 6.,21.
5872,CANTO 6.,"Then: 'Away! away!' she cried, and stretched her sword               _2515"
5873,CANTO 6.,"As 'twere a scourge over the courser's head,"
5874,CANTO 6.,"And lightly shook the reins.--We spake no word,"
5875,CANTO 6.,But like the vapour of the tempest fled
5876,CANTO 6.,Over the plain; her dark hair was dispread
5877,CANTO 6.,Like the pine's locks upon the lingering blast;                      _2520
5878,CANTO 6.,Over mine eyes its shadowy strings it spread
5879,CANTO 6.,"Fitfully, and the hills and streams fled fast,"
5880,CANTO 6.,As o'er their glimmering forms the steed's broad shadow passed.
5881,CANTO 6.,
5882,CANTO 6.,22.
5883,CANTO 6.,"And his hoofs ground the rocks to fire and dust,"
5884,CANTO 6.,"His strong sides made the torrents rise in spray,                    _2525"
5885,CANTO 6.,"And turbulence, as of a whirlwind's gust"

5887,CANTO 6.,"Through the desert night we sped, while she alway"
5888,CANTO 6.,"Gazed on a mountain which we neared, whose crest,"
5889,CANTO 6.,"Crowned with a marble ruin, in the ray                               _2530"
5890,CANTO 6.,Of the obscure stars gleamed;--its rugged breast
5891,CANTO 6.,"The steed strained up, and then his impulse did arrest."
5892,CANTO 6.,
5893,CANTO 6.,23.
5894,CANTO 6.,A rocky hill which overhung the Ocean:--
5895,CANTO 6.,"From that lone ruin, when the steed that panted"
5896,CANTO 6.,"Paused, might be heard the murmur of the motion                      _2535"
5897,CANTO 6.,"Of waters, as in spots for ever haunted"
5898,CANTO 6.,"By the choicest winds of Heaven, which are enchanted"
5899,CANTO 6.,"To music, by the wand of Solitude,"
5900,CANTO 6.,"That wizard wild, and the far tents implanted"
5901,CANTO 6.,"Upon the plain, be seen by those who stood                           _2540"
5902,CANTO 6.,Thence marking the dark shore of Ocean's curved flood.
5903,CANTO 6.,
5904,CANTO 6.,24.
5905,CANTO 6.,One moment these were heard and seen--another
5906,CANTO 6.,"Passed; and the two who stood beneath that night,"
5907,CANTO 6.,"Each only heard, or saw, or felt the other;"
5908,CANTO 6.,"As from the lofty steed she did alight,                              _2545"
5909,CANTO 6.,"Cythna, (for, from the eyes whose deepest light"
5910,CANTO 6.,Of love and sadness made my lips feel pale
5911,CANTO 6.,"With influence strange of mournfullest delight,"
5912,CANTO 6.,"My own sweet Cythna looked), with joy did quail,"
5913,CANTO 6.,And felt her strength in tears of human weakness fail.               _2550
5914,CANTO 6.,
5915,CANTO 6.,25.
5916,CANTO 6.,"And for a space in my embrace she rested,"
5917,CANTO 6.,"Her head on my unquiet heart reposing,"
5918,CANTO 6.,While my faint arms her languid frame invested;
5919,CANTO 6.,"At length she looked on me, and half unclosing"
5920,CANTO 6.,"Her tremulous lips, said, 'Friend, thy bands were losing             _2555"
5921,CANTO 6.,"The battle, as I stood before the King"
5922,CANTO 6.,"In bonds.--I burst them then, and swiftly choosing"
5923,CANTO 6.,"The time, did seize a Tartar's sword, and spring"
5924,CANTO 6.,"Upon his horse, and swift, as on the whirlwind's wing,"
5925,CANTO 6.,
5926,CANTO 6.,26.
5927,CANTO 6.,"'Have thou and I been borne beyond pursuer,                          _2560"
5928,CANTO 6.,"And we are here.'--Then, turning to the steed,"
5929,CANTO 6.,She pressed the white moon on his front with pure
5930,CANTO 6.,"And rose-like lips, and many a fragrant weed"
5931,CANTO 6.,"From the green ruin plucked, that he might feed;--"
5932,CANTO 6.,"But I to a stone seat that Maiden led,                               _2565"
5933,CANTO 6.,"And, kissing her fair eyes, said, 'Thou hast need"
5934,CANTO 6.,"Of rest,' and I heaped up the courser's bed"
5935,CANTO 6.,"In a green mossy nook, with mountain flowers dispread."
5936,CANTO 6.,
5937,CANTO 6.,27.
5938,CANTO 6.,"Within that ruin, where a shattered portal"
5939,CANTO 6.,"Looks to the eastern stars, abandoned now                            _2570"
5940,CANTO 6.,"By man, to be the home of things immortal,"
5941,CANTO 6.,"Memories, like awful ghosts which come and go,"
5942,CANTO 6.,"And must inherit all he builds below,"
5943,CANTO 6.,"When he is gone, a hall stood; o'er whose roof"
5944,CANTO 6.,"Fair clinging weeds with ivy pale did grow,                          _2575"
5945,CANTO 6.,"Clasping its gray rents with a verdurous woof,"
5946,CANTO 6.,"A hanging dome of leaves, a canopy moon-proof."
5947,CANTO 6.,
5948,CANTO 6.,28.
5949,CANTO 6.,"The autumnal winds, as if spell-bound, had made"
5950,CANTO 6.,"A natural couch of leaves in that recess,"
5951,CANTO 6.,"Which seasons none disturbed, but, in the shade                      _2580"
5952,CANTO 6.,"Of flowering parasites, did Spring love to dress"
5953,CANTO 6.,With their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness
5954,CANTO 6.,"Of those dead leaves, shedding their stars, whene'er"
5955,CANTO 6.,The wandering wind her nurslings might caress;
5956,CANTO 6.,Whose intertwining fingers ever there                                _2585
5957,CANTO 6.,Made music wild and soft that filled the listening air.
5958,CANTO 6.,
5959,CANTO 6.,29.
5960,CANTO 6.,"We know not where we go, or what sweet dream"
5961,CANTO 6.,May pilot us through caverns strange and fair
5962,CANTO 6.,"Of far and pathless passion, while the stream"
5963,CANTO 6.,"Of life, our bark doth on its whirlpools bear,                       _2590"
5964,CANTO 6.,Spreading swift wings as sails to the dim air;
5965,CANTO 6.,"Nor should we seek to know, so the devotion"
5966,CANTO 6.,Of love and gentle thoughts be heard still there
5967,CANTO 6.,Louder and louder from the utmost Ocean
5968,CANTO 6.,"Of universal life, attuning its commotion.                           _2595"
5969,CANTO 6.,
5970,CANTO 6.,30.
5971,CANTO 6.,To the pure all things are pure! Oblivion wrapped
5972,CANTO 6.,"Our spirits, and the fearful overthrow"
5973,CANTO 6.,"Of public hope was from our being snapped,"
5974,CANTO 6.,Though linked years had bound it there; for now
5975,CANTO 6.,"A power, a thirst, a knowledge, which below                          _2600"
5976,CANTO 6.,"All thoughts, like light beyond the atmosphere,"
5977,CANTO 6.,"Clothing its clouds with grace, doth ever flow,"
5978,CANTO 6.,"Came on us, as we sate in silence there,"
5979,CANTO 6.,Beneath the golden stars of the clear azure air;--
5980,CANTO 6.,
5981,CANTO 6.,31.
5982,CANTO 6.,In silence which doth follow talk that causes                        _2605
5983,CANTO 6.,"The baffled heart to speak with sighs and tears,"
5984,CANTO 6.,When wildering passion swalloweth up the pauses
5985,CANTO 6.,Of inexpressive speech:--the youthful years
5986,CANTO 6.,"Which we together passed, their hopes and fears,"
5987,CANTO 6.,"The blood itself which ran within our frames,                        _2610"
5988,CANTO 6.,That likeness of the features which endears
5989,CANTO 6.,"The thoughts expressed by them, our very names,"
5990,CANTO 6.,"And all the winged hours which speechless memory claims,"
5991,CANTO 6.,
5992,CANTO 6.,32.
5993,CANTO 6.,"Had found a voice--and ere that voice did pass,"
5994,CANTO 6.,"The night grew damp and dim, and, through a rent                     _2615"
5995,CANTO 6.,"Of the ruin where we sate, from the morass"
5996,CANTO 6.,"A wandering Meteor by some wild wind sent,"
5997,CANTO 6.,"Hung high in the green dome, to which it lent"
5998,CANTO 6.,A faint and pallid lustre; while the song
5999,CANTO 6.,"Of blasts, in which its blue hair quivering bent,                    _2620"
6000,CANTO 6.,Strewed strangest sounds the moving leaves among;
6001,CANTO 6.,"A wondrous light, the sound as of a spirit's tongue."
6002,CANTO 6.,
6003,CANTO 6.,33.
6004,CANTO 6.,"The Meteor showed the leaves on which we sate,"
6005,CANTO 6.,"And Cythna's glowing arms, and the thick ties"
6006,CANTO 6.,"Of her soft hair, which bent with gathered weight                    _2625"
6007,CANTO 6.,"My neck near hers; her dark and deepening eyes,"
6008,CANTO 6.,"Which, as twin phantoms of one star that lies"
6009,CANTO 6.,"O'er a dim well, move, though the star reposes,"
6010,CANTO 6.,"Swam in our mute and liquid ecstasies,"
6011,CANTO 6.,"Her marble brow, and eager lips, like roses,                         _2630"
6012,CANTO 6.,"With their own fragrance pale, which Spring but half uncloses."
6013,CANTO 6.,
6014,CANTO 6.,34.
6015,CANTO 6.,The Meteor to its far morass returned:
6016,CANTO 6.,The beating of our veins one interval
6017,CANTO 6.,Made still; and then I felt the blood that burned
6018,CANTO 6.,"Within her frame, mingle with mine, and fall                         _2635"
6019,CANTO 6.,Around my heart like fire; and over all
6020,CANTO 6.,"A mist was spread, the sickness of a deep"
6021,CANTO 6.,"And speechless swoon of joy, as might befall"
6022,CANTO 6.,Two disunited spirits when they leap
6023,CANTO 6.,In union from this earth's obscure and fading sleep.                 _2640
6024,CANTO 6.,
6025,CANTO 6.,35.
6026,CANTO 6.,Was it one moment that confounded thus
6027,CANTO 6.,"All thought, all sense, all feeling, into one"
6028,CANTO 6.,"Unutterable power, which shielded us"
6029,CANTO 6.,"Even from our own cold looks, when we had gone"
6030,CANTO 6.,Into a wide and wild oblivion                                        _2645
6031,CANTO 6.,Of tumult and of tenderness? or now
6032,CANTO 6.,"Had ages, such as make the moon and sun,"
6033,CANTO 6.,"The seasons, and mankind their changes know,"
6034,CANTO 6.,Left fear and time unfelt by us alone below?
6035,CANTO 6.,
6036,CANTO 6.,36.
6037,CANTO 6.,I know not. What are kisses whose fire clasps                        _2650
6038,CANTO 6.,"The failing heart in languishment, or limb"
6039,CANTO 6.,Twined within limb? or the quick dying gasps
6040,CANTO 6.,"Of the life meeting, when the faint eyes swim"
6041,CANTO 6.,"Through tears of a wide mist boundless and dim,"
6042,CANTO 6.,In one caress? What is the strong control                            _2655
6043,CANTO 6.,"Which leads the heart that dizzy steep to climb,"
6044,CANTO 6.,Where far over the world those vapours roll
6045,CANTO 6.,Which blend two restless frames in one reposing soul?
6046,CANTO 6.,37.
6047,CANTO 6.,"It is the shadow which doth float unseen,"
6048,CANTO 6.,"But not unfelt, o'er blind mortality,                                _2660"
6049,CANTO 6.,Whose divine darkness fled not from that green
6050,CANTO 6.,"And lone recess, where lapped in peace did lie"
6051,CANTO 6.,"Our linked frames, till, from the changing sky"
6052,CANTO 6.,That night and still another day had fled;
6053,CANTO 6.,"And then I saw and felt. The moon was high,                          _2665"
6054,CANTO 6.,"And clouds, as of a coming storm, were spread"
6055,CANTO 6.,"Under its orb,--loud winds were gathering overhead."
6056,CANTO 6.,
6057,CANTO 6.,38.
6058,CANTO 6.,"Cythna's sweet lips seemed lurid in the moon,"
6059,CANTO 6.,"Her fairest limbs with the night wind were chill,"
6060,CANTO 6.,And her dark tresses were all loosely strewn                         _2670
6061,CANTO 6.,"O'er her pale bosom:--all within was still,"
6062,CANTO 6.,And the sweet peace of joy did almost fill
6063,CANTO 6.,The depth of her unfathomable look;--
6064,CANTO 6.,"And we sate calmly, though that rocky hill,"
6065,CANTO 6.,"The waves contending in its caverns strook,                          _2675"
6066,CANTO 6.,"For they foreknew the storm, and the gray ruin shook."
6067,CANTO 6.,
6068,CANTO 6.,39.
6069,CANTO 6.,"There we unheeding sate, in the communion"
6070,CANTO 6.,"Of interchanged vows, which, with a rite"
6071,CANTO 6.,"Of faith most sweet and sacred, stamped our union.--"
6072,CANTO 6.,Few were the living hearts which could unite                         _2680
6073,CANTO 6.,"Like ours, or celebrate a bridal night"
6074,CANTO 6.,"With such close sympathies, for they had sprung"
6075,CANTO 6.,"From linked youth, and from the gentle might"
6076,CANTO 6.,"Of earliest love, delayed and cherished long,"
6077,CANTO 6.,"Which common hopes and fears made, like a tempest, strong.           _2685"
6078,CANTO 6.,
6079,CANTO 6.,40.
6080,CANTO 6.,"And such is Nature's law divine, that those"
6081,CANTO 6.,"Who grow together cannot choose but love,"
6082,CANTO 6.,"If faith or custom do not interpose,"
6083,CANTO 6.,Or common slavery mar what else might move
6084,CANTO 6.,All gentlest thoughts; as in the sacred grove                        _2690
6085,CANTO 6.,"Which shades the springs of Ethiopian Nile,"
6086,CANTO 6.,"That living tree which, if the arrowy dove"
6087,CANTO 6.,"Strike with her shadow, shrinks in fear awhile,"
6088,CANTO 6.,But its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile;
6089,CANTO 6.,
6090,CANTO 6.,41.
6091,CANTO 6.,"And clings to them, when darkness may dissever                       _2695"
6092,CANTO 6.,The close caresses of all duller plants
6093,CANTO 6.,Which bloom on the wide earth--thus we for ever
6094,CANTO 6.,"Were linked, for love had nursed us in the haunts"
6095,CANTO 6.,"Where knowledge, from its secret source enchants"
6096,CANTO 6.,"Young hearts with the fresh music of its springing,                  _2700"
6097,CANTO 6.,"Ere yet its gathered flood feeds human wants,"
6098,CANTO 6.,As the great Nile feeds Egypt; ever flinging
6099,CANTO 6.,Light on the woven boughs which o'er its waves are swinging.
6100,CANTO 6.,
6101,CANTO 6.,42.
6102,CANTO 6.,The tones of Cythna's voice like echoes were
6103,CANTO 6.,"Of those far murmuring streams; they rose and fell,                  _2705"
6104,CANTO 6.,"Mixed with mine own in the tempestuous air,--"
6105,CANTO 6.,"And so we sate, until our talk befell"
6106,CANTO 6.,"Of the late ruin, swift and horrible,"
6107,CANTO 6.,"And how those seeds of hope might yet be sown,"
6108,CANTO 6.,"Whose fruit is evil's mortal poison: well,                           _2710"
6109,CANTO 6.,"For us, this ruin made a watch-tower lone,"
6110,CANTO 6.,"But Cythna's eyes looked faint, and now two days were gone"
6111,CANTO 6.,
6112,CANTO 6.,43.
6113,CANTO 6.,Since she had food:--therefore I did awaken
6114,CANTO 6.,"The Tartar steed, who, from his ebon mane"
6115,CANTO 6.,"Soon as the clinging slumbers he had shaken,                         _2715"
6116,CANTO 6.,"Bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein,"
6117,CANTO 6.,Following me obediently; with pain
6118,CANTO 6.,"Of heart, so deep and dread, that one caress,"
6119,CANTO 6.,When lips and heart refuse to part again
6120,CANTO 6.,"Till they have told their fill, could scarce express                 _2720"
6121,CANTO 6.,"The anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness,"
6122,CANTO 6.,
6123,CANTO 6.,44.
6124,CANTO 6.,"Cythna beheld me part, as I bestrode"
6125,CANTO 6.,"That willing steed--the tempest and the night,"
6126,CANTO 6.,Which gave my path its safety as I rode
6127,CANTO 6.,"Down the ravine of rocks, did soon unite                             _2725"
6128,CANTO 6.,The darkness and the tumult of their might
6129,CANTO 6.,Borne on all winds.--Far through the streaming rain
6130,CANTO 6.,Floating at intervals the garments white
6131,CANTO 6.,"Of Cythna gleamed, and her voice once again"
6132,CANTO 6.,"Came to me on the gust, and soon I reached the plain.                _2730"
6133,CANTO 6.,
6134,CANTO 6.,45.
6135,CANTO 6.,"I dreaded not the tempest, nor did he"
6136,CANTO 6.,"Who bore me, but his eyeballs wide and red"
6137,CANTO 6.,Turned on the lightning's cleft exultingly;
6138,CANTO 6.,"And when the earth beneath his tameless tread,"
6139,CANTO 6.,"Shook with the sullen thunder, he would spread                       _2735"
6140,CANTO 6.,"His nostrils to the blast, and joyously"
6141,CANTO 6.,Mock the fierce peal with neighings;--thus we sped
6142,CANTO 6.,"O'er the lit plain, and soon I could descry"
6143,CANTO 6.,Where Death and Fire had gorged the spoil of victory.
6144,CANTO 6.,
6145,CANTO 6.,46.
6146,CANTO 6.,There was a desolate village in a wood                               _2740
6147,CANTO 6.,Whose bloom-inwoven leaves now scattering fed
6148,CANTO 6.,"The hungry storm; it was a place of blood,"
6149,CANTO 6.,A heap of hearthless walls;--the flames were dead
6150,CANTO 6.,"Within those dwellings now,--the life had fled"
6151,CANTO 6.,"From all those corpses now,--but the wide sky                        _2745"
6152,CANTO 6.,Flooded with lightning was ribbed overhead
6153,CANTO 6.,"By the black rafters, and around did lie"
6154,CANTO 6.,"Women, and babes, and men, slaughtered confusedly."
6155,CANTO 6.,
6156,CANTO 6.,47.
6157,CANTO 6.,Beside the fountain in the market-place
6158,CANTO 6.,"Dismounting, I beheld those corpses stare                            _2750"
6159,CANTO 6.,"With horny eyes upon each other's face,"
6160,CANTO 6.,"And on the earth and on the vacant air,"
6161,CANTO 6.,"And upon me, close to the waters where"
6162,CANTO 6.,"I stooped to slake my thirst;--I shrank to taste,"
6163,CANTO 6.,For the salt bitterness of blood was there;                          _2755
6164,CANTO 6.,"But tied the steed beside, and sought in haste"
6165,CANTO 6.,If any yet survived amid that ghastly waste.
6166,CANTO 6.,
6167,CANTO 6.,48.
6168,CANTO 6.,"No living thing was there beside one woman,"
6169,CANTO 6.,"Whom I found wandering in the streets, and she"
6170,CANTO 6.,Was withered from a likeness of aught human                          _2760
6171,CANTO 6.,"Into a fiend, by some strange misery:"
6172,CANTO 6.,"Soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me,"
6173,CANTO 6.,"And glued her burning lips to mine, and laughed"
6174,CANTO 6.,"With a loud, long, and frantic laugh of glee,"
6175,CANTO 6.,"And cried, 'Now, Mortal, thou hast deeply quaffed                    _2765"
6176,CANTO 6.,The Plague's blue kisses--soon millions shall pledge the draught!

6178,CANTO 6.,49.
6179,CANTO 6.,"'My name is Pestilence--this bosom dry,"
6180,CANTO 6.,Once fed two babes--a sister and a brother--
6181,CANTO 6.,"When I came home, one in the blood did lie"

6206,CANTO 6.,"Gathering from all those homes now desolate,                         _2790"

6212,CANTO 6.,"She leaped upon a pile, and lifted high"

6223,CANTO 6.,And vainly having with her madness striven

6226,CANTO 6.,"The lightning now grew pallid--rapidly,"
6227,CANTO 6.,As by the shore of the tempestuous sea

6239,CANTO 6.,Than e'er the prosperous know; the steed behind
6240,CANTO 6.,Trod peacefully along the mountain waste;
6241,CANTO 6.,We reached our home ere morning could unbind

6250,CANTO 6.,Thus in her lips and cheeks the vital spirit

6289,CANTO 7.,She said that not a tear did dare to start
6290,CANTO 7.,"From the swoln brain, and that her thoughts were firm"
6291,CANTO 7.,"When from all mortal hope she did depart,"

6300,CANTO 7.,"On loftiest enterprise, till on a day"
6301,CANTO 7.,The Tyrant heard her singing to her lute

6333,CANTO 7.,"All who approached their sphere,--like some calm wave"
6334,CANTO 7.,Vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath;

6340,CANTO 7.,The King felt pale upon his noonday throne:
6341,CANTO 7.,"At night two slaves he to her chamber sent,--"
6342,CANTO 7.,"One was a green and wrinkled eunuch, grown                           _2895"
6343,CANTO 7.,From human shape into an instrument
6344,CANTO 7.,"Of all things ill--distorted, bowed and bent."
6345,CANTO 7.,The other was a wretch from infancy
6346,CANTO 7.,Made dumb by poison; who nought knew or meant

6377,CANTO 7.,"Through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven,"

6387,CANTO 7.,"Imprisoned, boiled and leaped perpetually,"

6389,CANTO 7.,Winning the adverse depth; that spacious cell

8064,CANTO 11.,"Sunk on my heart, and almost wove a chain"

8467,CANTO 12.,18.
8468,CANTO 12.,The warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand

8481,CANTO 12.,"Of marble radiance, to that mighty fountain;"
8482,CANTO 12.,"And where the flood its own bright margin laves,                     _4615"

8758,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","was very fond of travelling, and ill-health increased this"
8759,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",restlessness. The sufferings occasioned by a cold English winter made

8761,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","climate. In 1816 he again visited Switzerland, and rented a house on"
8762,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the banks of the Lake of Geneva; and many a day, in cloud or sunshine,"
8763,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","was passed alone in his boat--sailing as the wind listed, or weltering"
8764,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",on the calm waters. The majestic aspect of Nature ministered such
8765,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse. His lines on the Bridge of
8766,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the Arve, and his ""Hymn to Intellectual Beauty"", were written at this"
8767,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",time. Perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association

8769,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","who, in the poem he wrote at that time, gave tokens that he shared for"

8783,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",intellectual freedom on his fellow-creatures. He created for this
8784,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine--full of enthusiasm for
8785,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the same objects; and they both, with will unvanquished, and the"
8786,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","deepest sense of the justice of their cause, met adversity and death."
8787,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",There exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth. The

8789,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","tends on him in sickness, is founded on that of Doctor Lind, who, when"
8790,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Shelley was at Eton, had often stood by to befriend and support him,"
8791,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration.

8794,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no
8795,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","great distance from London, and its neighbourhood to the Thames. The"
8796,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","poem was written in his boat, as it floated under the beech groves of"
8797,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Bisham, or during wanderings in the neighbouring country, which is"

8800,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant
8801,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",vegetation; and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile. With all
8802,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","this wealth of Nature which, either in the form of gentlemen's parks"
8803,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","or soil dedicated to agriculture, flourishes around, Marlow was"
8804,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",inhabited (I hope it is altered now) by a very poor population. The
8805,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","women are lacemakers, and lose their health by sedentary labour, for"
8806,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",which they were very ill paid. The Poor-laws ground to the dust not

8808,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",were obliged to pay poor-rates. The changes produced by peace
8809,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","following a long war, and a bad harvest, brought with them the most"
8810,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",heart-rending evils to the poor. Shelley afforded what alleviation he
8811,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","could. In the winter, while bringing out his poem, he had a severe"
8812,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","attack of ophthalmia, caught while visiting the poor cottages. I"
8813,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","mention these things,--for this minute and active sympathy with his"
8814,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","fellow-creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations,"
8815,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race.
8816,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
8817,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","The poem, bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression,"
8818,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","met with many censurers, not only among those who allow of no virtue"
8819,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","but such as supports the cause they espouse, but even among those"
8820,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",whose opinions were similar to his own. I extract a portion of a
8821,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",letter written in answer to one of these friends. It best details the
8822,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","impulses of Shelley's mind, and his motives: it was written with"
8823,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",entire unreserve; and is therefore a precious monument of his own

8839,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","me, in some degree at least. The poem was produced by a series of"

8843,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","contains was written with the same feeling--as real, though not so"
8844,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",prophetic--as the communications of a dying man. I never presumed
8845,"NOTE ON THE ""REVOLT OF ISLAM"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless; but, when I"

9414,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The story of ""Rosalind and Helen"" is, undoubtedly, not an attempt in"
9415,ADVERTISEMENT.,the highest style of poetry. It is in no degree calculated to excite
9416,ADVERTISEMENT.,"profound meditation; and if, by interesting the affections and amusing"
9417,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the imagination, it awakens a certain ideal melancholy favourable to"
9418,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the reception of more important impressions, it will produce in the"
9419,ADVERTISEMENT.,reader all that the writer experienced in the composition. I resigned
9420,ADVERTISEMENT.,"myself, as I wrote, to the impulses of the feelings which moulded the"
9421,ADVERTISEMENT.,conception of the story; and this impulse determined the pauses of a
9422,ADVERTISEMENT.,"measure, which only pretends to be regular inasmuch as it corresponds"
9423,ADVERTISEMENT.,"with, and expresses, the irregularity of the imaginations which"
9424,ADVERTISEMENT.,inspired it.
9425,ADVERTISEMENT.,
9426,ADVERTISEMENT.,I do not know which of the few scattered poems I left in England will
9427,ADVERTISEMENT.,"be selected by my bookseller to add to this collection. One (""Lines"
9428,ADVERTISEMENT.,"written among the Euganean Hills"".--Editor.), which I sent from Italy,"
9429,ADVERTISEMENT.,was written after a day's excursion among those lovely mountains which
9430,ADVERTISEMENT.,"surround what was once the retreat, and where is now the sepulchre, of"
9431,ADVERTISEMENT.,Petrarch. If any one is inclined to condemn the insertion of the
9432,ADVERTISEMENT.,"introductory lines, which image forth the sudden relief of a state of"
9433,ADVERTISEMENT.,deep despondency by the radiant visions disclosed by the sudden burst
9434,ADVERTISEMENT.,of an Italian sunrise in autumn on the highest peak of those
9435,ADVERTISEMENT.,"delightful mountains, I can only offer as my excuse, that they were"
9436,ADVERTISEMENT.,"not erased at the request of a dear friend, with whom added years of"
9437,ADVERTISEMENT.,"intercourse only add to my apprehension of its value, and who would"
9438,ADVERTISEMENT.,"have had more right than any one to complain, that she has not been"

9505,ROSALIND:,Of one so lost as Helen. Now                                         _55
9506,ROSALIND:,"Bewildered by my dire despair,"
9507,ROSALIND:,"Wondering I blush, and weep that thou"
9508,ROSALIND:,"Should'st love me still,--thou only!--There,"
9509,ROSALIND:,Let us sit on that gray stone
9510,ROSALIND:,Till our mournful talk be done.                                      _60
9511,ROSALIND:,
9512,HELEN:,HELEN:
9513,HELEN:,Alas! not there; I cannot bear
9514,HELEN:,The murmur of this lake to hear.
9515,HELEN:,"A sound from there, Rosalind dear,"
9516,HELEN:,Which never yet I heard elsewhere
9517,HELEN:,"But in our native land, recurs,                                      _65"
9518,HELEN:,Even here where now we meet. It stirs
9519,HELEN:,Too much of suffocating sorrow!
9520,HELEN:,In the dell of yon dark chestnutwood
9521,HELEN:,"Is a stone seat, a solitude"
9522,HELEN:,Less like our own. The ghost of Peace                                _70
9523,HELEN:,"Will not desert this spot. To-morrow,"
9524,HELEN:,"If thy kind feelings should not cease,"
9525,HELEN:,We may sit here.
9526,HELEN:,
9527,ROSALIND:,ROSALIND:
9528,ROSALIND:,"Thou lead, my sweet,"
9529,ROSALIND:,And I will follow.
9530,ROSALIND:,
9531,HENRY:,HENRY:
9532,HENRY:,'Tis Fenici's seat
9533,HENRY:,"Where you are going? This is not the way,                            _75"
9534,HENRY:,Mamma; it leads behind those trees that grow
9535,HENRY:,Close to the little river.
9536,HENRY:,
9537,HELEN:,HELEN:
9538,HELEN:,Yes: I know;
9539,HELEN:,"I was bewildered. Kiss me and be gay,"
9540,HELEN:,Dear boy: why do you sob?
9541,HELEN:,
9542,HENRY:,HENRY:
9543,HENRY:,I do not know:
9544,HENRY:,But it might break any one's heart to see                            _80
9545,HENRY:,You and the lady cry so bitterly.
9546,HENRY:,
9547,HELEN:,HELEN:
9548,HELEN:,"It is a gentle child, my friend. Go home,"
9549,HELEN:,"Henry, and play with Lilla till I come."
9550,HELEN:,We only cried with joy to see each other;
9551,HELEN:,We are quite merry now: Good-night.
9552,HELEN:,
9553,HELEN:,The boy                                                              _85
9554,HELEN:,"Lifted a sudden look upon his mother,"
9555,HELEN:,And in the gleam of forced and hollow joy
9556,HELEN:,"Which lightened o'er her face, laughed with the glee"
9557,HELEN:,"Of light and unsuspecting infancy,"
9558,HELEN:,"And whispered in her ear, 'Bring home with you                       _90"
9559,HELEN:,"That sweet strange lady-friend.' Then off he flew,"
9560,HELEN:,"But stopped, and beckoned with a meaning smile,"
9561,HELEN:,"Where the road turned. Pale Rosalind the while,"
9562,HELEN:,"Hiding her face, stood weeping silently."
9563,HELEN:,
9564,HELEN:,In silence then they took the way                                    _95
9565,HELEN:,Beneath the forest's solitude.
9566,HELEN:,"It was a vast and antique wood,"
9567,HELEN:,Thro' which they took their way;
9568,HELEN:,And the gray shades of evening
9569,HELEN:,O'er that green wilderness did fling                                 _100
9570,HELEN:,Still deeper solitude.
9571,HELEN:,Pursuing still the path that wound
9572,HELEN:,The vast and knotted trees around
9573,HELEN:,"Through which slow shades were wandering,"
9574,HELEN:,"To a deep lawny dell they came,                                      _105"
9575,HELEN:,"To a stone seat beside a spring,"
9576,HELEN:,O'er which the columned wood did frame
9577,HELEN:,"A roofless temple, like the fane"
9578,HELEN:,"Where, ere new creeds could faith obtain,"
9579,HELEN:,Man's early race once knelt beneath                                  _110
9580,HELEN:,The overhanging deity.
9581,HELEN:,"O'er this fair fountain hung the sky,"
9582,HELEN:,"Now spangled with rare stars. The snake,"
9583,HELEN:,"The pale snake, that with eager breath"
9584,HELEN:,"Creeps here his noontide thirst to slake,                            _115"
9585,HELEN:,"Is beaming with many a mingled hue,"
9586,HELEN:,"Shed from yon dome's eternal blue,"
9587,HELEN:,When he floats on that dark and lucid flood
9588,HELEN:,In the light of his own loveliness;
9589,HELEN:,And the birds that in the fountain dip                               _120
9590,HELEN:,"Their plumes, with fearless fellowship"
9591,HELEN:,Above and round him wheel and hover.
9592,HELEN:,The fitful wind is heard to stir
9593,HELEN:,One solitary leaf on high;
9594,HELEN:,The chirping of the grasshopper                                      _125
9595,HELEN:,Fills every pause. There is emotion
9596,HELEN:,In all that dwells at noontide here;
9597,HELEN:,"Then, through the intricate wild wood,"
9598,HELEN:,A maze of life and light and motion
9599,HELEN:,Is woven. But there is stillness now:                                _130
9600,HELEN:,"Gloom, and the trance of Nature now:"
9601,HELEN:,The snake is in his cave asleep;
9602,HELEN:,The birds are on the branches dreaming:
9603,HELEN:,Only the shadows creep:
9604,HELEN:,Only the glow-worm is gleaming:                                      _135
9605,HELEN:,Only the owls and the nightingales
9606,HELEN:,"Wake in this dell when daylight fails,"
9607,HELEN:,And gray shades gather in the woods:
9608,HELEN:,And the owls have all fled far away
9609,HELEN:,"In a merrier glen to hoot and play,                                  _140"
9610,HELEN:,For the moon is veiled and sleeping now.
9611,HELEN:,The accustomed nightingale still broods
9612,HELEN:,"On her accustomed bough,"
9613,HELEN:,But she is mute; for her false mate
9614,HELEN:,Has fled and left her desolate.                                      _145
9615,HELEN:,
9616,HELEN:,This silent spot tradition old
9617,HELEN:,Had peopled with the spectral dead.
9618,HELEN:,For the roots of the speaker's hair felt cold
9619,HELEN:,"And stiff, as with tremulous lips he told"
9620,HELEN:,That a hellish shape at midnight led                                 _150
9621,HELEN:,"The ghost of a youth with hoary hair,"
9622,HELEN:,"And sate on the seat beside him there,"
9623,HELEN:,"Till a naked child came wandering by,"
9624,HELEN:,When the fiend would change to a lady fair!
9625,HELEN:,A fearful tale! The truth was worse:                                 _155
9626,HELEN:,For here a sister and a brother
9627,HELEN:,"Had solemnized a monstrous curse,"
9628,HELEN:,Meeting in this fair solitude:
9629,HELEN:,"For beneath yon very sky,"
9630,HELEN:,Had they resigned to one another                                     _160
9631,HELEN:,Body and soul. The multitude:
9632,HELEN:,"Tracking them to the secret wood,"
9633,HELEN:,"Tore limb from limb their innocent child,"
9634,HELEN:,And stabbed and trampled on its mother;
9635,HELEN:,"But the youth, for God's most holy grace,                            _165"
9636,HELEN:,A priest saved to burn in the market-place.
9637,HELEN:,
9638,HELEN:,Duly at evening Helen came
9639,HELEN:,"To this lone silent spot,"
9640,HELEN:,From the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow
9641,HELEN:,So much of sympathy to borrow                                        _170
9642,HELEN:,As soothed her own dark lot.
9643,HELEN:,"Duly each evening from her home,"
9644,HELEN:,With her fair child would Helen come
9645,HELEN:,"To sit upon that antique seat,"
9646,HELEN:,While the hues of day were pale;                                     _175
9647,HELEN:,And the bright boy beside her feet
9648,HELEN:,"Now lay, lifting at intervals"
9649,HELEN:,His broad blue eyes on her;
9650,HELEN:,"Now, where some sudden impulse calls"
9651,HELEN:,Following. He was a gentle boy                                       _180
9652,HELEN:,And in all gentle sorts took joy;
9653,HELEN:,"Oft in a dry leaf for a boat,"
9654,HELEN:,"With a small feather for a sail,"
9655,HELEN:,"His fancy on that spring would float,"
9656,HELEN:,If some invisible breeze might stir                                  _185
9657,HELEN:,Its marble calm: and Helen smiled
9658,HELEN:,"Through tears of awe on the gay child,"
9659,HELEN:,"To think that a boy as fair as he,"
9660,HELEN:,"In years which never more may be,"
9661,HELEN:,"By that same fount, in that same wood,                               _190"
9662,HELEN:,The like sweet fancies had pursued;
9663,HELEN:,"And that a mother, lost like her,"
9664,HELEN:,Had mournfully sate watching him.
9665,HELEN:,Then all the scene was wont to swim
9666,HELEN:,Through the mist of a burning tear.                                  _195
9667,HELEN:,
9668,HELEN:,For many months had Helen known
9669,HELEN:,This scene; and now she thither turned
9670,HELEN:,"Her footsteps, not alone."
9671,HELEN:,"The friend whose falsehood she had mourned,"
9672,HELEN:,Sate with her on that seat of stone.                                 _200
9673,HELEN:,"Silent they sate; for evening,"
9674,HELEN:,And the power its glimpses bring
9675,HELEN:,"Had, with one awful shadow, quelled"
9676,HELEN:,The passion of their grief. They sate
9677,HELEN:,"With linked hands, for unrepelled                                    _205"
9678,HELEN:,Had Helen taken Rosalind's.
9679,HELEN:,"Like the autumn wind, when it unbinds"
9680,HELEN:,"The tangled locks of the nightshade's hair,"
9681,HELEN:,Which is twined in the sultry summer air
9682,HELEN:,"Round the walls of an outworn sepulchre,                             _210"
9683,HELEN:,"Did the voice of Helen, sad and sweet,"
9684,HELEN:,"And the sound of her heart that ever beat,"
9685,HELEN:,"As with sighs and words she breathed on her,"
9686,HELEN:,"Unbind the knots of her friend's despair,"
9687,HELEN:,Till her thoughts were free to float and flow;                       _215
9688,HELEN:,"And from her labouring bosom now,"
9689,HELEN:,"Like the bursting of a prisoned flame,"
9690,HELEN:,The voice of a long pent sorrow came.
9691,HELEN:,
9692,ROSALIND:,ROSALIND:
9693,ROSALIND:,I saw the dark earth fall upon
9694,ROSALIND:,The coffin; and I saw the stone                                      _220
9695,ROSALIND:,Laid over him whom this cold breast
9696,ROSALIND:,Had pillowed to his nightly rest!
9697,ROSALIND:,"Thou knowest not, thou canst not know"
9698,ROSALIND:,My agony. Oh! I could not weep:
9699,ROSALIND:,The sources whence such blessings flow                               _225
9700,ROSALIND:,Were not to be approached by me!
9701,ROSALIND:,"But I could smile, and I could sleep,"
9702,ROSALIND:,Though with a self-accusing heart.
9703,ROSALIND:,"In morning's light, in evening's gloom,"
9704,ROSALIND:,"I watched,--and would not thence depart--                            _230"
9705,ROSALIND:,My husband's unlamented tomb.
9706,ROSALIND:,"My children knew their sire was gone,"
9707,ROSALIND:,"But when I told them,--'He is dead,'--"
9708,ROSALIND:,"They laughed aloud in frantic glee,"
9709,ROSALIND:,"They clapped their hands and leaped about,                           _235"
9710,ROSALIND:,Answering each other's ecstasy
9711,ROSALIND:,With many a prank and merry shout.
9712,ROSALIND:,"But I sate silent and alone,"
9713,ROSALIND:,Wrapped in the mock of mourning weed.
9714,ROSALIND:,
9715,ROSALIND:,"They laughed, for he was dead: but I                                 _240"
9716,ROSALIND:,"Sate with a hard and tearless eye,"
9717,ROSALIND:,And with a heart which would deny
9718,ROSALIND:,"The secret joy it could not quell,"
9719,ROSALIND:,Low muttering o'er his loathed name;
9720,ROSALIND:,Till from that self-contention came                                  _245
9721,ROSALIND:,Remorse where sin was none; a hell
9722,ROSALIND:,Which in pure spirits should not dwell.
9723,ROSALIND:,
9724,ROSALIND:,I'll tell thee truth. He was a man
9725,ROSALIND:,"Hard, selfish, loving only gold,"
9726,ROSALIND:,Yet full of guile; his pale eyes ran                                 _250
9727,ROSALIND:,"With tears, which each some falsehood told,"
9728,ROSALIND:,And oft his smooth and bridled tongue
9729,ROSALIND:,Would give the lie to his flushing cheek;
9730,ROSALIND:,He was a coward to the strong:
9731,ROSALIND:,"He was a tyrant to the weak,                                         _255"
9732,ROSALIND:,On whom his vengeance he would wreak:
9733,ROSALIND:,"For scorn, whose arrows search the heart,"
9734,ROSALIND:,"From many a stranger's eye would dart,"
9735,ROSALIND:,"And on his memory cling, and follow"
9736,ROSALIND:,His soul to its home so cold and hollow.                             _260
9737,ROSALIND:,"He was a tyrant to the weak,"
9738,ROSALIND:,"And we were such, alas the day!"
9739,ROSALIND:,"Oft, when my little ones at play,"
9740,ROSALIND:,"Were in youth's natural lightness gay,"
9741,ROSALIND:,Or if they listened to some tale                                     _265
9742,ROSALIND:,"Of travellers, or of fairy land,--"
9743,ROSALIND:,When the light from the wood-fire's dying brand
9744,ROSALIND:,"Flashed on their faces,--if they heard"
9745,ROSALIND:,Or thought they heard upon the stair
9746,ROSALIND:,"His footstep, the suspended word                                     _270"
9747,ROSALIND:,Died on my lips: we all grew pale:
9748,ROSALIND:,The babe at my bosom was hushed with fear
9749,ROSALIND:,If it thought it heard its father near;
9750,ROSALIND:,And my two wild boys would near my knee
9751,ROSALIND:,"Cling, cowed and cowering fearfully.                                 _275"
9752,ROSALIND:,
9753,ROSALIND:,I'll tell thee truth: I loved another.
9754,ROSALIND:,"His name in my ear was ever ringing,"
9755,ROSALIND:,His form to my brain was ever clinging:
9756,ROSALIND:,"Yet if some stranger breathed that name,"
9757,ROSALIND:,"My lips turned white, and my heart beat fast:                        _280"
9758,ROSALIND:,"My nights were once haunted by dreams of flame,"
9759,ROSALIND:,My days were dim in the shadow cast
9760,ROSALIND:,By the memory of the same!
9761,ROSALIND:,"Day and night, day and night,"
9762,ROSALIND:,"He was my breath and life and light,                                 _285"
9763,ROSALIND:,"For three short years, which soon were passed."
9764,ROSALIND:,"On the fourth, my gentle mother"
9765,ROSALIND:,"Led me to the shrine, to be"
9766,ROSALIND:,His sworn bride eternally.
9767,ROSALIND:,"And now we stood on the altar stair,                                 _290"
9768,ROSALIND:,"When my father came from a distant land,"
9769,ROSALIND:,And with a loud and fearful cry
9770,ROSALIND:,Rushed between us suddenly.
9771,ROSALIND:,"I saw the stream of his thin gray hair,"
9772,ROSALIND:,"I saw his lean and lifted hand,                                      _295"
9773,ROSALIND:,"And heard his words,--and live! Oh God!"
9774,ROSALIND:,"Wherefore do I live?--'Hold, hold!'"
9775,ROSALIND:,"He cried, 'I tell thee 'tis her brother!"
9776,ROSALIND:,"Thy mother, boy, beneath the sod"
9777,ROSALIND:,Of yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold:                       _300
9778,ROSALIND:,"I am now weak, and pale, and old:"
9779,ROSALIND:,"We were once dear to one another,"
9780,ROSALIND:,I and that corpse! Thou art our child!'
9781,ROSALIND:,Then with a laugh both long and wild
9782,ROSALIND:,The youth upon the pavement fell:                                    _305
9783,ROSALIND:,"They found him dead! All looked on me,"
9784,ROSALIND:,The spasms of my despair to see:
9785,ROSALIND:,But I was calm. I went away:
9786,ROSALIND:,I was clammy-cold like clay!
9787,ROSALIND:,I did not weep: I did not speak:                                     _310
9788,ROSALIND:,"But day by day, week after week,"
9789,ROSALIND:,I walked about like a corpse alive!
9790,ROSALIND:,"Alas! sweet friend, you must believe"
9791,ROSALIND:,This heart is stone: it did not break.
9792,ROSALIND:,"My father lived a little while,                                      _315"
9793,ROSALIND:,"But all might see that he was dying,"
9794,ROSALIND:,He smiled with such a woeful smile!
9795,ROSALIND:,When he was in the churchyard lying
9796,ROSALIND:,"Among the worms, we grew quite poor,"
9797,ROSALIND:,So that no one would give us bread:                                  _320
9798,ROSALIND:,"My mother looked at me, and said"
9799,ROSALIND:,"Faint words of cheer, which only meant"
9800,ROSALIND:,That she could die and be content;
9801,ROSALIND:,So I went forth from the same church door
9802,ROSALIND:,To another husband's bed.                                            _325
9803,ROSALIND:,"And this was he who died at last,"
9804,ROSALIND:,"When weeks and months and years had passed,"
9805,ROSALIND:,Through which I firmly did fulfil
9806,ROSALIND:,"My duties, a devoted wife,"
9807,ROSALIND:,"With the stern step of vanquished will,                              _330"
9808,ROSALIND:,"Walking beneath the night of life,"
9809,ROSALIND:,"Whose hours extinguished, like slow rain"
9810,ROSALIND:,"Falling for ever, pain by pain,"
9811,ROSALIND:,The very hope of death's dear rest;
9812,ROSALIND:,"Which, since the heart within my breast                              _335"
9813,ROSALIND:,"Of natural life was dispossessed,"
9814,ROSALIND:,Its strange sustainer there had been.
9815,ROSALIND:,
9816,ROSALIND:,"When flowers were dead, and grass was green"
9817,ROSALIND:,"Upon my mother's grave,--that mother"
9818,ROSALIND:,"Whom to outlive, and cheer, and make                                 _340"
9819,ROSALIND:,"My wan eyes glitter for her sake,"
9820,ROSALIND:,"Was my vowed task, the single care"
9821,ROSALIND:,"Which once gave life to my despair,--"
9822,ROSALIND:,When she was a thing that did not stir
9823,ROSALIND:,And the crawling worms were cradling her                             _345
9824,ROSALIND:,To a sleep more deep and so more sweet
9825,ROSALIND:,"Than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee,"
9826,ROSALIND:,I lived: a living pulse then beat
9827,ROSALIND:,Beneath my heart that awakened me.
9828,ROSALIND:,What was this pulse so warm and free?                                _350
9829,ROSALIND:,Alas! I knew it could not be
9830,ROSALIND:,My own dull blood: 'twas like a thought
9831,ROSALIND:,"Of liquid love, that spread and wrought"
9832,ROSALIND:,"Under my bosom and in my brain,"
9833,ROSALIND:,And crept with the blood through every vein;                         _355
9834,ROSALIND:,"And hour by hour, day after day,"
9835,ROSALIND:,"The wonder could not charm away,"
9836,ROSALIND:,"But laid in sleep, my wakeful pain,"
9837,ROSALIND:,"Until I knew it was a child,"
9838,ROSALIND:,"And then I wept. For long, long years                                _360"
9839,ROSALIND:,These frozen eyes had shed no tears:
9840,ROSALIND:,But now--'twas the season fair and mild
9841,ROSALIND:,When April has wept itself to May:
9842,ROSALIND:,I sate through the sweet sunny day
9843,ROSALIND:,"By my window bowered round with leaves,                              _365"
9844,ROSALIND:,And down my cheeks the quick tears fell
9845,ROSALIND:,"Like twinkling rain-drops from the eaves,"
9846,ROSALIND:,When warm spring showers are passing o'er.
9847,ROSALIND:,"O Helen, none can ever tell"
9848,ROSALIND:,The joy it was to weep once more!                                    _370
9849,ROSALIND:,
9850,ROSALIND:,I wept to think how hard it were
9851,ROSALIND:,"To kill my babe, and take from it"
9852,ROSALIND:,"The sense of light, and the warm air,"
9853,ROSALIND:,"And my own fond and tender care,"
9854,ROSALIND:,And love and smiles; ere I knew yet                                  _375
9855,ROSALIND:,"That these for it might, as for me,"
9856,ROSALIND:,Be the masks of a grinning mockery.
9857,ROSALIND:,"And haply, I would dream, 'twere sweet"
9858,ROSALIND:,"To feed it from my faded breast,"
9859,ROSALIND:,Or mark my own heart's restless beat                                 _380
9860,ROSALIND:,"Rock it to its untroubled rest,"
9861,ROSALIND:,And watch the growing soul beneath
9862,ROSALIND:,"Dawn in faint smiles; and hear its breath,"
9863,ROSALIND:,"Half interrupted by calm sighs,"
9864,ROSALIND:,And search the depth of its fair eyes                                _385
9865,ROSALIND:,For long departed memories!
9866,ROSALIND:,And so I lived till that sweet load
9867,ROSALIND:,Was lightened. Darkly forward flowed
9868,ROSALIND:,"The stream of years, and on it bore"
9869,ROSALIND:,Two shapes of gladness to my sight;                                  _390
9870,ROSALIND:,"Two other babes, delightful more"
9871,ROSALIND:,"In my lost soul's abandoned night,"
9872,ROSALIND:,Than their own country ships may be
9873,ROSALIND:,"Sailing towards wrecked mariners,"
9874,ROSALIND:,Who cling to the rock of a wintry sea.                               _395
9875,ROSALIND:,"For each, as it came, brought soothing tears;"
9876,ROSALIND:,"And a loosening warmth, as each one lay"
9877,ROSALIND:,Sucking the sullen milk away
9878,ROSALIND:,"About my frozen heart, did play,"
9879,ROSALIND:,"And weaned it, oh how painfully--                                    _400"
9880,ROSALIND:,As they themselves were weaned each one
9881,ROSALIND:,"From that sweet food,--even from the thirst"
9882,ROSALIND:,"Of death, and nothingness, and rest,"
9883,ROSALIND:,Strange inmate of a living breast!
9884,ROSALIND:,Which all that I had undergone                                       _405
9885,ROSALIND:,"Of grief and shame, since she, who first"
9886,ROSALIND:,"The gates of that dark refuge closed,"
9887,ROSALIND:,"Came to my sight, and almost burst"
9888,ROSALIND:,The seal of that Lethean spring;
9889,ROSALIND:,But these fair shadows interposed:                                   _410
9890,ROSALIND:,For all delights are shadows now!
9891,ROSALIND:,And from my brain to my dull brow
9892,ROSALIND:,The heavy tears gather and flow:
9893,ROSALIND:,"I cannot speak: Oh, let me weep!"
9894,ROSALIND:,
9895,ROSALIND:,The tears which fell from her wan eyes                               _415
9896,ROSALIND:,Glimmered among the moonlight dew:
9897,ROSALIND:,Her deep hard sobs and heavy sighs
9898,ROSALIND:,Their echoes in the darkness threw.
9899,ROSALIND:,"When she grew calm, she thus did keep"
9900,ROSALIND:,The tenor of her tale:
9901,ROSALIND:,He died:                                                             _420
9902,ROSALIND:,"I know not how: he was not old,"
9903,ROSALIND:,If age be numbered by its years:
9904,ROSALIND:,"But he was bowed and bent with fears,"
9905,ROSALIND:,"Pale with the quenchless thirst of gold,"
9906,ROSALIND:,"Which, like fierce fever, left him weak;                             _425"
9907,ROSALIND:,And his strait lip and bloated cheek
9908,ROSALIND:,Were warped in spasms by hollow sneers;
9909,ROSALIND:,"And selfish cares with barren plough,"
9910,ROSALIND:,"Not age, had lined his narrow brow,"
9911,ROSALIND:,"And foul and cruel thoughts, which feed                              _430"
9912,ROSALIND:,"Upon the withering life within,"
9913,ROSALIND:,Like vipers on some poisonous weed.
9914,ROSALIND:,Whether his ill were death or sin
9915,ROSALIND:,"None knew, until he died indeed,"
9916,ROSALIND:,And then men owned they were the same.                               _435
9917,ROSALIND:,
9918,ROSALIND:,Seven days within my chamber lay
9919,ROSALIND:,"That corse, and my babes made holiday:"
9920,ROSALIND:,"At last, I told them what is death:"
9921,ROSALIND:,"The eldest, with a kind of shame,"
9922,ROSALIND:,"Came to my knees with silent breath,                                 _440"
9923,ROSALIND:,And sate awe-stricken at my feet;
9924,ROSALIND:,"And soon the others left their play,"
9925,ROSALIND:,And sate there too. It is unmeet
9926,ROSALIND:,To shed on the brief flower of youth
9927,ROSALIND:,The withering knowledge of the grave;                                _445
9928,ROSALIND:,From me remorse then wrung that truth.
9929,ROSALIND:,I could not bear the joy which gave
9930,ROSALIND:,Too just a response to mine own.
9931,ROSALIND:,"In vain. I dared not feign a groan,"
9932,ROSALIND:,"And in their artless looks I saw,                                    _450"
9933,ROSALIND:,"Between the mists of fear and awe,"
9934,ROSALIND:,"That my own thought was theirs, and they"
9935,ROSALIND:,"Expressed it not in words, but said,"
9936,ROSALIND:,"Each in its heart, how every day"
9937,ROSALIND:,"Will pass in happy work and play,                                    _455"
9938,ROSALIND:,Now he is dead and gone away.
9939,ROSALIND:,
9940,ROSALIND:,After the funeral all our kin
9941,ROSALIND:,"Assembled, and the will was read."
9942,ROSALIND:,"My friend, I tell thee, even the dead"
9943,ROSALIND:,"Have strength, their putrid shrouds within,                          _460"
9944,ROSALIND:,To blast and torture. Those who live
9945,ROSALIND:,"Still fear the living, but a corse"
9946,ROSALIND:,"Is merciless, and power doth give"
9947,ROSALIND:,To such pale tyrants half the spoil
9948,ROSALIND:,"He rends from those who groan and toil,                              _465"
9949,ROSALIND:,Because they blush not with remorse
9950,ROSALIND:,"Among their crawling worms. Behold,"
9951,ROSALIND:,I have no child! my tale grows old
9952,ROSALIND:,"With grief, and staggers: let it reach"
9953,ROSALIND:,"The limits of my feeble speech,                                      _470"
9954,ROSALIND:,And languidly at length recline
9955,ROSALIND:,On the brink of its own grave and mine.
9956,ROSALIND:,
9957,ROSALIND:,Thou knowest what a thing is Poverty
9958,ROSALIND:,Among the fallen on evil days:
9959,ROSALIND:,"'Tis Crime, and Fear, and Infamy,                                    _475"
9960,ROSALIND:,And houseless Want in frozen ways
9961,ROSALIND:,"Wandering ungarmented, and Pain,"
9962,ROSALIND:,"And, worse than all, that inward stain"
9963,ROSALIND:,"Foul Self-contempt, which drowns in sneers"
9964,ROSALIND:,"Youth's starlight smile, and makes its tears                         _480"
9965,ROSALIND:,"First like hot gall, then dry for ever!"
9966,ROSALIND:,And well thou knowest a mother never
9967,ROSALIND:,"Could doom her children to this ill,"
9968,ROSALIND:,And well he knew the same. The will
9969,ROSALIND:,"Imported, that if e'er again                                         _485"
9970,ROSALIND:,"I sought my children to behold,"
9971,ROSALIND:,Or in my birthplace did remain
9972,ROSALIND:,"Beyond three days, whose hours were told,"
9973,ROSALIND:,"They should inherit nought: and he,"
9974,ROSALIND:,"To whom next came their patrimony,                                   _490"
9975,ROSALIND:,"A sallow lawyer, cruel and cold,"
9976,ROSALIND:,"Aye watched me, as the will was read,"
9977,ROSALIND:,"With eyes askance, which sought to see"
9978,ROSALIND:,The secrets of my agony;
9979,ROSALIND:,And with close lips and anxious brow                                 _495
9980,ROSALIND:,Stood canvassing still to and fro
9981,ROSALIND:,"The chance of my resolve, and all"
9982,ROSALIND:,The dead man's caution just did call;
9983,ROSALIND:,For in that killing lie 'twas said--
9984,ROSALIND:,"'She is adulterous, and doth hold                                    _500"
9985,ROSALIND:,In secret that the Christian creed
9986,ROSALIND:,"Is false, and therefore is much need"
9987,ROSALIND:,That I should have a care to save
9988,ROSALIND:,My children from eternal fire.'
9989,ROSALIND:,"Friend, he was sheltered by the grave,                               _505"
9990,ROSALIND:,And therefore dared to be a liar!
9991,ROSALIND:,"In truth, the Indian on the pyre"
9992,ROSALIND:,"Of her dead husband, half consumed,"
9993,ROSALIND:,"As well might there be false, as I"
9994,ROSALIND:,"To those abhorred embraces doomed,                                   _510"
9995,ROSALIND:,Far worse than fire's brief agony
9996,ROSALIND:,"As to the Christian creed, if true"
9997,ROSALIND:,"Or false, I never questioned it:"
9998,ROSALIND:,I took it as the vulgar do:
9999,ROSALIND:,Nor my vexed soul had leisure yet                                    _515
10000,ROSALIND:,"To doubt the things men say, or deem"
10001,ROSALIND:,That they are other than they seem.
10002,ROSALIND:,
10003,ROSALIND:,"All present who those crimes did hear,"
10004,ROSALIND:,"In feigned or actual scorn and fear,"
10005,ROSALIND:,"Men, women, children, slunk away,                                    _520"
10006,ROSALIND:,"Whispering with self-contented pride,"
10007,ROSALIND:,Which half suspects its own base lie.
10008,ROSALIND:,"I spoke to none, nor did abide,"
10009,ROSALIND:,"But silently I went my way,"
10010,ROSALIND:,Nor noticed I where joyously                                         _525
10011,ROSALIND:,"Sate my two younger babes at play,"
10012,ROSALIND:,In the court-yard through which I passed;
10013,ROSALIND:,But went with footsteps firm and fast
10014,ROSALIND:,"Till I came to the brink of the ocean green,"
10015,ROSALIND:,"And there, a woman with gray hairs,                                  _530"
10016,ROSALIND:,"Who had my mother's servant been,"
10017,ROSALIND:,"Kneeling, with many tears and prayers,"
10018,ROSALIND:,"Made me accept a purse of gold,"
10019,ROSALIND:,Half of the earnings she had kept
10020,ROSALIND:,To refuge her when weak and old.                                     _535
10021,ROSALIND:,
10022,ROSALIND:,"With woe, which never sleeps or slept,"
10023,ROSALIND:,I wander now. 'Tis a vain thought--
10024,ROSALIND:,"But on yon alp, whose snowy head"
10025,ROSALIND:,"'Mid the azure air is islanded,"
10026,ROSALIND:,"(We see it o'er the flood of cloud,                                  _540"
10027,ROSALIND:,Which sunrise from its eastern caves
10028,ROSALIND:,"Drives, wrinkling into golden waves,"
10029,ROSALIND:,"Hung with its precipices proud,"
10030,ROSALIND:,From that gray stone where first we met)
10031,ROSALIND:,There now--who knows the dead feel nought?--                         _545
10032,ROSALIND:,Should be my grave; for he who yet
10033,ROSALIND:,"Is my soul's soul, once said: ''Twere sweet"
10034,ROSALIND:,"'Mid stars and lightnings to abide,"
10035,ROSALIND:,"And winds and lulling snows, that beat"
10036,ROSALIND:,"With their soft flakes the mountain wide,                            _550"
10037,ROSALIND:,"Where weary meteor lamps repose,"
10038,ROSALIND:,And languid storms their pinions close:
10039,ROSALIND:,"And all things strong and bright and pure,"
10040,ROSALIND:,"And ever during, aye endure:"
10041,ROSALIND:,"Who knows, if one were buried there,                                 _555"
10042,ROSALIND:,"But these things might our spirits make,"
10043,ROSALIND:,"Amid the all-surrounding air,"
10044,ROSALIND:,Their own eternity partake?'
10045,ROSALIND:,Then 'twas a wild and playful saying
10046,ROSALIND:,"At which I laughed, or seemed to laugh:                              _560"
10047,ROSALIND:,"They were his words: now heed my praying,"
10048,ROSALIND:,And let them be my epitaph.
10049,ROSALIND:,Thy memory for a term may be
10050,ROSALIND:,My monument. Wilt remember me?
10051,ROSALIND:,"I know thou wilt, and canst forgive                                  _565"
10052,ROSALIND:,Whilst in this erring world to live
10053,ROSALIND:,"My soul disdained not, that I thought"
10054,ROSALIND:,Its lying forms were worthy aught
10055,ROSALIND:,And much less thee.
10056,ROSALIND:,
10057,HELEN:,HELEN:
10058,HELEN:,"O speak not so,"
10059,HELEN:,But come to me and pour thy woe                                      _570
10060,HELEN:,"Into this heart, full though it be,"
10061,HELEN:,"Ay, overflowing with its own:"
10062,HELEN:,I thought that grief had severed me
10063,HELEN:,From all beside who weep and groan;
10064,HELEN:,"Its likeness upon earth to be,                                       _575"
10065,HELEN:,Its express image; but thou art
10066,HELEN:,More wretched. Sweet! we will not part
10067,HELEN:,"Henceforth, if death be not division;"
10068,HELEN:,"If so, the dead feel no contrition."
10069,HELEN:,But wilt thou hear since last we parted                              _580
10070,HELEN:,All that has left me broken hearted?
10071,HELEN:,
10072,ROSALIND:,ROSALIND:
10073,ROSALIND:,"Yes, speak. The faintest stars are scarcely shorn"
10074,ROSALIND:,Of their thin beams by that delusive morn
10075,ROSALIND:,"Which sinks again in darkness, like the light"
10076,ROSALIND:,"Of early love, soon lost in total night.                             _585"
10077,ROSALIND:,
10078,HELEN:,HELEN:
10079,HELEN:,"Alas! Italian winds are mild,"
10080,HELEN:,But my bosom is cold--wintry cold--
10081,HELEN:,"When the warm air weaves, among the fresh leaves,"
10082,HELEN:,"Soft music, my poor brain is wild,"
10083,HELEN:,"And I am weak like a nursling child,                                 _590"
10084,HELEN:,Though my soul with grief is gray and old.
10085,HELEN:,
10086,ROSALIND:,ROSALIND:
10087,ROSALIND:,"Weep not at thine own words, though they must make"
10088,ROSALIND:,Me weep. What is thy tale?
10089,ROSALIND:,
10090,HELEN:,HELEN:
10091,HELEN:,I fear 'twill shake
10092,HELEN:,Thy gentle heart with tears. Thou well
10093,HELEN:,"Rememberest when we met no more,                                     _595"
10094,HELEN:,"And, though I dwelt with Lionel,"
10095,HELEN:,That friendless caution pierced me sore
10096,HELEN:,With grief; a wound my spirit bore
10097,HELEN:,"Indignantly, but when he died,"
10098,HELEN:,With him lay dead both hope and pride.                               _600
10099,HELEN:,Alas! all hope is buried now.
10100,HELEN:,But then men dreamed the aged earth
10101,HELEN:,"Was labouring in that mighty birth,"
10102,HELEN:,Which many a poet and a sage
10103,HELEN:,Has aye foreseen--the happy age                                      _605
10104,HELEN:,When truth and love shall dwell below
10105,HELEN:,Among the works and ways of men;
10106,HELEN:,Which on this world not power but will
10107,HELEN:,Even now is wanting to fulfil.
10108,HELEN:,
10109,HELEN:,Among mankind what thence befell                                     _610
10110,HELEN:,"Of strife, how vain, is known too well;"
10111,HELEN:,When Liberty's dear paean fell
10112,HELEN:,"'Mid murderous howls. To Lionel,"
10113,HELEN:,"Though of great wealth and lineage high,"
10114,HELEN:,Yet through those dungeon walls there came                           _615
10115,HELEN:,"Thy thrilling light, O Liberty!"
10116,HELEN:,And as the meteor's midnight flame
10117,HELEN:,"Startles the dreamer, sun-like truth"
10118,HELEN:,"Flashed on his visionary youth,"
10119,HELEN:,"And filled him, not with love, but faith,                            _620"
10120,HELEN:,"And hope, and courage mute in death;"
10121,HELEN:,"For love and life in him were twins,"
10122,HELEN:,Born at one birth: in every other
10123,HELEN:,"First life then love its course begins,"
10124,HELEN:,Though they be children of one mother;                               _625
10125,HELEN:,And so through this dark world they fleet
10126,HELEN:,"Divided, till in death they meet;"
10127,HELEN:,But he loved all things ever. Then
10128,HELEN:,"He passed amid the strife of men,"
10129,HELEN:,And stood at the throne of armed power                               _630
10130,HELEN:,Pleading for a world of woe:
10131,HELEN:,Secure as one on a rock-built tower
10132,HELEN:,"O'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro,"
10133,HELEN:,'Mid the passions wild of human kind
10134,HELEN:,"He stood, like a spirit calming them;                                _635"
10135,HELEN:,"For, it was said, his words could bind"
10136,HELEN:,"Like music the lulled crowd, and stem"
10137,HELEN:,That torrent of unquiet dream
10138,HELEN:,"Which mortals truth and reason deem,"
10139,HELEN:,But is revenge and fear and pride.                                   _640
10140,HELEN:,Joyous he was; and hope and peace
10141,HELEN:,"On all who heard him did abide,"
10142,HELEN:,"Raining like dew from his sweet talk,"
10143,HELEN:,As where the evening star may walk
10144,HELEN:,"Along the brink of the gloomy seas,                                  _645"
10145,HELEN:,Liquid mists of splendour quiver.
10146,HELEN:,His very gestures touched to tears
10147,HELEN:,"The unpersuaded tyrant, never"
10148,HELEN:,So moved before: his presence stung
10149,HELEN:,"The torturers with their victim's pain,                              _650"
10150,HELEN:,And none knew how; and through their ears
10151,HELEN:,The subtle witchcraft of his tongue
10152,HELEN:,Unlocked the hearts of those who keep
10153,HELEN:,"Gold, the world's bond of slavery."
10154,HELEN:,"Men wondered, and some sneered to see                                _655"
10155,HELEN:,One sow what he could never reap:
10156,HELEN:,"For he is rich, they said, and young,"
10157,HELEN:,And might drink from the depths of luxury.
10158,HELEN:,"If he seeks Fame, Fame never crowned"
10159,HELEN:,The champion of a trampled creed:                                    _660
10160,HELEN:,"If he seeks Power, Power is enthroned"
10161,HELEN:,"'Mid ancient rights and wrongs, to feed"
10162,HELEN:,"Which hungry wolves with praise and spoil,"
10163,HELEN:,Those who would sit near Power must toil;
10164,HELEN:,"And such, there sitting, all may see.                                _665"
10165,HELEN:,What seeks he? All that others seek
10166,HELEN:,"He casts away, like a vile weed"
10167,HELEN:,Which the sea casts unreturningly.
10168,HELEN:,That poor and hungry men should break
10169,HELEN:,"The laws which wreak them toil and scorn,                            _670"
10170,HELEN:,We understand; but Lionel
10171,HELEN:,"We know, is rich and nobly born."
10172,HELEN:,So wondered they: yet all men loved
10173,HELEN:,"Young Lionel, though few approved;"
10174,HELEN:,"All but the priests, whose hatred fell                               _675"
10175,HELEN:,"Like the unseen blight of a smiling day,"
10176,HELEN:,"The withering honey dew, which clings"
10177,HELEN:,"Under the bright green buds of May,"
10178,HELEN:,Whilst they unfold their emerald wings:
10179,HELEN:,For he made verses wild and queer                                    _680
10180,HELEN:,"On the strange creeds priests hold so dear,"
10181,HELEN:,Because they bring them land and gold.
10182,HELEN:,"Of devils and saints and all such gear,"
10183,HELEN:,He made tales which whoso heard or read
10184,HELEN:,Would laugh till he were almost dead.                                _685
10185,HELEN:,So this grew a proverb: 'Don't get old
10186,HELEN:,"Till Lionel's ""Banquet in Hell"" you hear,"
10187,HELEN:,And then you will laugh yourself young again.'
10188,HELEN:,"So the priests hated him, and he"
10189,HELEN:,Repaid their hate with cheerful glee.                                _690
10190,HELEN:,
10191,HELEN:,"Ah, smiles and joyance quickly died,"
10192,HELEN:,For public hope grew pale and dim
10193,HELEN:,"In an altered time and tide,"
10194,HELEN:,"And in its wasting withered him,"
10195,HELEN:,As a summer flower that blows too soon                               _695
10196,HELEN:,"Droops in the smile of the waning moon,"
10197,HELEN:,When it scatters through an April night
10198,HELEN:,The frozen dews of wrinkling blight.
10199,HELEN:,None now hoped more. Gray Power was seated
10200,HELEN:,Safely on her ancestral throne;                                      _700
10201,HELEN:,"And Faith, the Python, undefeated,"
10202,HELEN:,Even to its blood-stained steps dragged on
10203,HELEN:,"Her foul and wounded train, and men"
10204,HELEN:,"Were trampled and deceived again,"
10205,HELEN:,And words and shows again could bind                                 _705
10206,HELEN:,The wailing tribes of human kind
10207,HELEN:,In scorn and famine. Fire and blood
10208,HELEN:,"Raged round the raging multitude,"
10209,HELEN:,To fields remote by tyrants sent
10210,HELEN:,To be the scorned instrument                                         _710
10211,HELEN:,With which they drag from mines of gore
10212,HELEN:,The chains their slaves yet ever wore:
10213,HELEN:,"And in the streets men met each other,"
10214,HELEN:,"And by old altars and in halls,"
10215,HELEN:,And smiled again at festivals.                                       _715
10216,HELEN:,But each man found in his heart's brother
10217,HELEN:,"Cold cheer; for all, though half deceived,"
10218,HELEN:,"The outworn creeds again believed,"
10219,HELEN:,"And the same round anew began,"
10220,HELEN:,Which the weary world yet ever ran.                                  _720
10221,HELEN:,
10222,HELEN:,"Many then wept, not tears, but gall"
10223,HELEN:,"Within their hearts, like drops which fall"
10224,HELEN:,Wasting the fountain-stone away.
10225,HELEN:,And in that dark and evil day
10226,HELEN:,"Did all desires and thoughts, that claim                             _725"
10227,HELEN:,"Men's care--ambition, friendship, fame,"
10228,HELEN:,"Love, hope, though hope was now despair--"
10229,HELEN:,"Indue the colours of this change,"
10230,HELEN:,As from the all-surrounding air
10231,HELEN:,"The earth takes hues obscure and strange,                            _730"
10232,HELEN:,When storm and earthquake linger there.
10233,HELEN:,
10234,HELEN:,"And so, my friend, it then befell"
10235,HELEN:,"To many, most to Lionel,"
10236,HELEN:,Whose hope was like the life of youth
10237,HELEN:,"Within him, and when dead, became                                    _735"
10238,HELEN:,"A spirit of unresting flame,"
10239,HELEN:,Which goaded him in his distress
10240,HELEN:,Over the world's vast wilderness.
10241,HELEN:,"Three years he left his native land,"
10242,HELEN:,"And on the fourth, when he returned,                                 _740"
10243,HELEN:,None knew him: he was stricken deep
10244,HELEN:,"With some disease of mind, and turned"
10245,HELEN:,Into aught unlike Lionel.
10246,HELEN:,"On him, on whom, did he pause in sleep,"
10247,HELEN:,"Serenest smiles were wont to keep,                                   _745"
10248,HELEN:,"And, did he wake, a winged band"
10249,HELEN:,"Of bright persuasions, which had fed"
10250,HELEN:,"On his sweet lips and liquid eyes,"
10251,HELEN:,Kept their swift pinions half outspread
10252,HELEN:,To do on men his least command;                                      _750
10253,HELEN:,"On him, whom once 'twas paradise"
10254,HELEN:,"Even to behold, now misery lay:"
10255,HELEN:,"In his own heart 'twas merciless,"
10256,HELEN:,To all things else none may express
10257,HELEN:,Its innocence and tenderness.                                        _755
10258,HELEN:,
10259,HELEN:,'Twas said that he had refuge sought
10260,HELEN:,In love from his unquiet thought
10261,HELEN:,"In distant lands, and been deceived"
10262,HELEN:,"By some strange show; for there were found,"
10263,HELEN:,Blotted with tears as those relieved                                 _760
10264,HELEN:,"By their own words are wont to do,"
10265,HELEN:,"These mournful verses on the ground,"

10268,HELEN:,'How am I changed! my hopes were once like fire:

10270,HELEN:,How am I lost! on wings of swift desire
10271,HELEN:,Among Heaven's winds my spirit once did move.

10281,HELEN:,And sit through the long day gnawing the core
10282,HELEN:,"Of my bitter heart, and, like a miser, keep,"
10283,HELEN:,"Since none in what I feel take pain or pleasure,"
10284,HELEN:,To my own soul its self-consuming treasure.'
10285,HELEN:,
10286,HELEN:,He dwelt beside me near the sea;                                     _780
10287,HELEN:,"And oft in evening did we meet,"
10288,HELEN:,"When the waves, beneath the starlight, flee"
10289,HELEN:,"O'er the yellow sands with silver feet,"
10290,HELEN:,"And talked: our talk was sad and sweet,"
10291,HELEN:,Till slowly from his mien there passed                               _785
10292,HELEN:,The desolation which it spoke;
10293,HELEN:,"And smiles,--as when the lightning's blast"

10295,HELEN:,"The next spring shows leaves pale and rare,"
10296,HELEN:,"But like flowers delicate and fair,                                  _790"
10297,HELEN:,"On its rent boughs,--again arrayed"
10298,HELEN:,His countenance in tender light:
10299,HELEN:,"His words grew subtile fire, which made"
10300,HELEN:,The air his hearers breathed delight:
10301,HELEN:,"His motions, like the winds, were free,                              _795"
10302,HELEN:,"Which bend the bright grass gracefully,"
10303,HELEN:,Then fade away in circlets faint:
10304,HELEN:,"And winged Hope, on which upborne"
10305,HELEN:,"His soul seemed hovering in his eyes,"
10306,HELEN:,Like some bright spirit newly born                                   _800
10307,HELEN:,"Floating amid the sunny skies,"
10308,HELEN:,Sprang forth from his rent heart anew.
10309,HELEN:,"Yet o'er his talk, and looks, and mien,"
10310,HELEN:,"Tempering their loveliness too keen,"
10311,HELEN:,"Past woe its shadow backward threw,                                  _805"
10312,HELEN:,"Till like an exhalation, spread"
10313,HELEN:,"From flowers half drunk with evening dew,"
10314,HELEN:,They did become infectious: sweet
10315,HELEN:,And subtle mists of sense and thought:
10316,HELEN:,"Which wrapped us soon, when we might meet,                           _810"
10317,HELEN:,Almost from our own looks and aught
10318,HELEN:,"The wild world holds. And so, his mind"
10319,HELEN:,"Was healed, while mine grew sick with fear:"
10320,HELEN:,"For ever now his health declined,"
10321,HELEN:,Like some frail bark which cannot bear                               _815
10322,HELEN:,"The impulse of an altered wind,"
10323,HELEN:,Though prosperous: and my heart grew full
10324,HELEN:,'Mid its new joy of a new care:

10337,HELEN:,Would gather in the light serene
10338,HELEN:,"Of smiles, whose lustre bright and soft"

10342,HELEN:,"And I hung o'er him in his sleep,"
10343,HELEN:,"Till, like an image in the lake"
10344,HELEN:,"Which rains disturb, my tears would break"
10345,HELEN:,The shadow of that slumber deep:
10346,HELEN:,"Then he would bid me not to weep,                                    _840"
10347,HELEN:,"And say, with flattery false, yet sweet,"
10348,HELEN:,"That death and he could never meet,"
10349,HELEN:,If I would never part with him.
10350,HELEN:,"And so we loved, and did unite"

10353,HELEN:,"By men to bind but once provided,"
10354,HELEN:,"Could not be shared by him and me,"
10355,HELEN:,"Or they would kill him in their glee,"
10356,HELEN:,"I shuddered, and then laughing said--                                _850"
10357,HELEN:,"'We will have rites our faith to bind,"

10396,HELEN:,What poets know and prophesy;
10397,HELEN:,"And said, with voice that made them shiver                           _890"
10398,HELEN:,"And clung like music in my brain,"
10399,HELEN:,And which the mute walls spoke again
10400,HELEN:,Prolonging it with deepened strain:
10401,HELEN:,"'Fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever,"
10402,HELEN:,Or the priests of the bloody faith;                                  _895
10403,HELEN:,"They stand on the brink of that mighty river,"
10404,HELEN:,Whose waves they have tainted with death:
10405,HELEN:,"It is fed from the depths of a thousand dells,"
10406,HELEN:,"Around them it foams, and rages, and swells,"
10407,HELEN:,"And their swords and their sceptres I floating see,                  _900"
10408,HELEN:,Like wrecks in the surge of eternity.'
10409,HELEN:,
10410,HELEN:,I dwelt beside the prison gate;
10411,HELEN:,And the strange crowd that out and in
10412,HELEN:,"Passed, some, no doubt, with mine own fate,"
10413,HELEN:,"Might have fretted me with its ceaseless din,                        _905"
10414,HELEN:,But the fever of care was louder within.
10415,HELEN:,"Soon, but too late, in penitence"
10416,HELEN:,"Or fear, his foes released him thence:"
10417,HELEN:,"I saw his thin and languid form,"
10418,HELEN:,"As leaning on the jailor's arm,                                      _910"
10419,HELEN:,"Whose hardened eyes grew moist the while,"
10420,HELEN:,"To meet his mute and faded smile,"
10421,HELEN:,"And hear his words of kind farewell,"
10422,HELEN:,He tottered forth from his damp cell.
10423,HELEN:,"Many had never wept before,                                          _915"
10424,HELEN:,From whom fast tears then gushed and fell:
10425,HELEN:,"Many will relent no more,"
10426,HELEN:,"Who sobbed like infants then; aye, all"
10427,HELEN:,"Who thronged the prison's stony hall,"
10428,HELEN:,"The rulers or the slaves of law,                                     _920"
10429,HELEN:,Felt with a new surprise and awe
10430,HELEN:,"That they were human, till strong shame"
10431,HELEN:,Made them again become the same.
10432,HELEN:,"The prison blood-hounds, huge and grim,"
10433,HELEN:,"From human looks the infection caught,                               _925"
10434,HELEN:,And fondly crouched and fawned on him;
10435,HELEN:,"And men have heard the prisoners say,"
10436,HELEN:,"Who in their rotting dungeons lay,"
10437,HELEN:,"That from that hour, throughout one day,"
10438,HELEN:,The fierce despair and hate which kept                               _930
10439,HELEN:,Their trampled bosoms almost slept:
10440,HELEN:,"Where, like twin vultures, they hung feeding"
10441,HELEN:,"On each heart's wound, wide torn and bleeding,--"
10442,HELEN:,"Because their jailors' rule, they thought,"
10443,HELEN:,"Grew merciful, like a parent's sway.                                 _935"
10444,HELEN:,
10445,HELEN:,"I know not how, but we were free:"
10446,HELEN:,"And Lionel sate alone with me,"
10447,HELEN:,As the carriage drove thro' the streets apace;
10448,HELEN:,And we looked upon each other's face;
10449,HELEN:,And the blood in our fingers intertwined                             _940
10450,HELEN:,"Ran like the thoughts of a single mind,"
10451,HELEN:,As the swift emotions went and came
10452,HELEN:,Thro' the veins of each united frame.
10453,HELEN:,So thro' the long long streets we passed
10454,HELEN:,Of the million-peopled City vast;                                    _945
10455,HELEN:,"Which is that desert, where each one"
10456,HELEN:,"Seeks his mate yet is alone,"
10457,HELEN:,Beloved and sought and mourned of none;
10458,HELEN:,"Until the clear blue sky was seen,"
10459,HELEN:,"And the grassy meadows bright and green,                             _950"
10460,HELEN:,"And then I sunk in his embrace,"
10461,HELEN:,Enclosing there a mighty space
10462,HELEN:,Of love: and so we travelled on
10463,HELEN:,"By woods, and fields of yellow flowers,"
10464,HELEN:,"And towns, and villages, and towers,                                 _955"
10465,HELEN:,Day after day of happy hours.
10466,HELEN:,"It was the azure time of June,"
10467,HELEN:,"When the skies are deep in the stainless noon,"
10468,HELEN:,And the warm and fitful breezes shake
10469,HELEN:,"The fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar,                        _960"
10470,HELEN:,And there were odours then to make
10471,HELEN:,The very breath we did respire
10472,HELEN:,"A liquid element, whereon"
10473,HELEN:,"Our spirits, like delighted things"
10474,HELEN:,"That walk the air on subtle wings,                                   _965"
10475,HELEN:,"Floated and mingled far away,"
10476,HELEN:,'Mid the warm winds of the sunny day.
10477,HELEN:,And when the evening star came forth
10478,HELEN:,"Above the curve of the new bent moon,"
10479,HELEN:,"And light and sound ebbed from the earth,                            _970"
10480,HELEN:,Like the tide of the full and the weary sea
10481,HELEN:,"To the depths of its own tranquillity,"
10482,HELEN:,Our natures to its own repose
10483,HELEN:,Did the earth's breathless sleep attune:
10484,HELEN:,"Like flowers, which on each other close                              _975"
10485,HELEN:,"Their languid leaves when daylight's gone,"
10486,HELEN:,"We lay, till new emotions came,"
10487,HELEN:,Which seemed to make each mortal frame
10488,HELEN:,"One soul of interwoven flame,"
10489,HELEN:,"A life in life, a second birth                                       _980"
10490,HELEN:,"In worlds diviner far than earth,"
10491,HELEN:,"Which, like two strains of harmony"
10492,HELEN:,That mingle in the silent sky
10493,HELEN:,"Then slowly disunite, passed by"
10494,HELEN:,"And left the tenderness of tears,                                    _985"
10495,HELEN:,"A soft oblivion of all fears,"
10496,HELEN:,A sweet sleep: so we travelled on
10497,HELEN:,"Till we came to the home of Lionel,"
10498,HELEN:,"Among the mountains wild and lone,"
10499,HELEN:,"Beside the hoary western sea,                                        _990"
10500,HELEN:,Which near the verge of the echoing shore
10501,HELEN:,The massy forest shadowed o'er.
10502,HELEN:,
10503,HELEN:,"The ancient steward, with hair all hoar,"
10504,HELEN:,"As we alighted, wept to see"
10505,HELEN:,His master changed so fearfully;                                     _995
10506,HELEN:,And the old man's sobs did waken me
10507,HELEN:,From my dream of unremaining gladness;
10508,HELEN:,The truth flashed o'er me like quick madness
10509,HELEN:,"When I looked, and saw that there was death"
10510,HELEN:,On Lionel: yet day by day                                            _1000
10511,HELEN:,"He lived, till fear grew hope and faith,"
10512,HELEN:,"And in my soul I dared to say,"
10513,HELEN:,Nothing so bright can pass away:
10514,HELEN:,"Death is dark, and foul, and dull,"
10515,HELEN:,But he is--O how beautiful!                                          _1005
10516,HELEN:,"Yet day by day he grew more weak,"
10517,HELEN:,"And his sweet voice, when he might speak,"
10518,HELEN:,"Which ne'er was loud, became more low;"
10519,HELEN:,And the light which flashed through his waxen cheek
10520,HELEN:,"Grew faint, as the rose-like hues which flow                         _1010"
10521,HELEN:,From sunset o'er the Alpine snow:
10522,HELEN:,"And death seemed not like death in him,"
10523,HELEN:,For the spirit of life o'er every limb
10524,HELEN:,"Lingered, a mist of sense and thought."
10525,HELEN:,When the summer wind faint odours brought                            _1015
10526,HELEN:,"From mountain flowers, even as it passed"
10527,HELEN:,"His cheek would change, as the noonday sea"
10528,HELEN:,Which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully.
10529,HELEN:,"If but a cloud the sky o'ercast,"
10530,HELEN:,"You might see his colour come and go,                                _1020"
10531,HELEN:,And the softest strain of music made
10532,HELEN:,"Sweet smiles, yet sad, arise and fade"
10533,HELEN:,Amid the dew of his tender eyes;
10534,HELEN:,"And the breath, with intermitting flow,"
10535,HELEN:,Made his pale lips quiver and part.                                  _1025
10536,HELEN:,"You might hear the beatings of his heart,"
10537,HELEN:,"Quick, but not strong; and with my tresses"
10538,HELEN:,When oft he playfully would bind
10539,HELEN:,In the bowers of mossy lonelinesses
10540,HELEN:,"His neck, and win me so to mingle                                    _1030"
10541,HELEN:,"In the sweet depth of woven caresses,"
10542,HELEN:,"And our faint limbs were intertwined,"
10543,HELEN:,Alas! the unquiet life did tingle
10544,HELEN:,"From mine own heart through every vein,"
10545,HELEN:,"Like a captive in dreams of liberty,                                 _1035"
10546,HELEN:,Who beats the walls of his stony cell.
10547,HELEN:,"But his, it seemed already free,"
10548,HELEN:,Like the shadow of fire surrounding me!
10549,HELEN:,On my faint eyes and limbs did dwell
10550,HELEN:,"That spirit as it passed, till soon,                                 _1040"
10551,HELEN:,"As a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon,"
10552,HELEN:,"Beneath its light invisible,"
10553,HELEN:,Is seen when it folds its gray wings again
10554,HELEN:,"To alight on midnight's dusky plain,"
10555,HELEN:,"I lived and saw, and the gathering soul                              _1045"
10556,HELEN:,"Passed from beneath that strong control,"
10557,HELEN:,And I fell on a life which was sick with fear
10558,HELEN:,Of all the woe that now I bear.
10559,HELEN:,
10560,HELEN:,"Amid a bloomless myrtle wood,"
10561,HELEN:,"On a green and sea-girt promontory,                                  _1050"
10562,HELEN:,"Not far from where we dwelt, there stood"
10563,HELEN:,"In record of a sweet sad story,"
10564,HELEN:,An altar and a temple bright
10565,HELEN:,"Circled by steps, and o'er the gate"
10566,HELEN:,"Was sculptured, 'To Fidelity;'                                       _1055"
10567,HELEN:,"And in the shrine an image sate,"
10568,HELEN:,All veiled: but there was seen the light
10569,HELEN:,Of smiles which faintly could express
10570,HELEN:,A mingled pain and tenderness
10571,HELEN:,Through that ethereal drapery.                                       _1060
10572,HELEN:,"The left hand held the head, the right--"
10573,HELEN:,"Beyond the veil, beneath the skin,"
10574,HELEN:,You might see the nerves quivering within--
10575,HELEN:,Was forcing the point of a barbed dart
10576,HELEN:,Into its side-convulsing heart.                                      _1065
10577,HELEN:,"An unskilled hand, yet one informed"
10578,HELEN:,"With genius, had the marble warmed"
10579,HELEN:,With that pathetic life. This tale
10580,HELEN:,"It told: A dog had from the sea,"
10581,HELEN:,"When the tide was raging fearfully,                                  _1070"
10582,HELEN:,"Dragged Lionel's mother, weak and pale,"
10583,HELEN:,"Then died beside her on the sand,"
10584,HELEN:,And she that temple thence had planned;
10585,HELEN:,But it was Lionel's own hand
10586,HELEN:,Had wrought the image. Each new moon                                 _1075
10587,HELEN:,"That lady did, in this lone fane,"
10588,HELEN:,"The rites of a religion sweet,"
10589,HELEN:,Whose god was in her heart and brain:
10590,HELEN:,The seasons' loveliest flowers were strewn
10591,HELEN:,"On the marble floor beneath her feet,                                _1080"
10592,HELEN:,And she brought crowns of sea-buds white
10593,HELEN:,"Whose odour is so sweet and faint,"
10594,HELEN:,"And weeds, like branching chrysolite,"
10595,HELEN:,Woven in devices fine and quaint.
10596,HELEN:,And tears from her brown eyes did stain                              _1085
10597,HELEN:,The altar: need but look upon
10598,HELEN:,"That dying statue fair and wan,"
10599,HELEN:,"If tears should cease, to weep again:"
10600,HELEN:,"And rare Arabian odours came,"
10601,HELEN:,Through the myrtle copses steaming thence                            _1090
10602,HELEN:,"From the hissing frankincense,"
10603,HELEN:,"Whose smoke, wool-white as ocean foam,"
10604,HELEN:,Hung in dense flocks beneath the dome--
10605,HELEN:,"That ivory dome, whose azure night"
10606,HELEN:,"With golden stars, like heaven, was bright--                         _1095"
10607,HELEN:,O'er the split cedar's pointed flame;
10608,HELEN:,And the lady's harp would kindle there
10609,HELEN:,"The melody of an old air,"
10610,HELEN:,Softer than sleep; the villagers
10611,HELEN:,"Mixed their religion up with hers,                                   _1100"
10612,HELEN:,"And, as they listened round, shed tears."
10613,HELEN:,
10614,HELEN:,One eve he led me to this fane:
10615,HELEN:,Daylight on its last purple cloud
10616,HELEN:,"Was lingering gray, and soon her strain"
10617,HELEN:,"The nightingale began; now loud,                                     _1105"
10618,HELEN:,"Climbing in circles the windless sky,"
10619,HELEN:,Now dying music; suddenly
10620,HELEN:,"'Tis scattered in a thousand notes,"
10621,HELEN:,And now to the hushed ear it floats
10622,HELEN:,"Like field smells known in infancy,                                  _1110"
10623,HELEN:,"Then failing, soothes the air again."
10624,HELEN:,"We sate within that temple lone,"
10625,HELEN:,Pavilioned round with Parian stone:
10626,HELEN:,"His mother's harp stood near, and oft"
10627,HELEN:,I had awakened music soft                                            _1115
10628,HELEN:,Amid its wires: the nightingale
10629,HELEN:,Was pausing in her heaven-taught tale:
10630,HELEN:,"'Now drain the cup,' said Lionel,"
10631,HELEN:,'Which the poet-bird has crowned so well
10632,HELEN:,With the wine of her bright and liquid song!                         _1120
10633,HELEN:,Heardst thou not sweet words among
10634,HELEN:,That heaven-resounding minstrelsy?
10635,HELEN:,Heard'st thou not that those who die
10636,HELEN:,Awake in a world of ecstasy?
10637,HELEN:,"That love, when limbs are interwoven,                                _1125"
10638,HELEN:,"And sleep, when the night of life is cloven,"
10639,HELEN:,"And thought, to the world's dim boundaries clinging,"
10640,HELEN:,"And music, when one beloved is singing,"
10641,HELEN:,Is death? Let us drain right joyously
10642,HELEN:,The cup which the sweet bird fills for me.'                          _1130
10643,HELEN:,"He paused, and to my lips he bent"
10644,HELEN:,His own: like spirit his words went
10645,HELEN:,Through all my limbs with the speed of fire;
10646,HELEN:,"And his keen eyes, glittering through mine,"
10647,HELEN:,"Filled me with the flame divine,                                     _1135"
10648,HELEN:,"Which in their orbs was burning far,"
10649,HELEN:,"Like the light of an unmeasured star,"
10650,HELEN:,In the sky of midnight dark and deep:
10651,HELEN:,"Yes, 'twas his soul that did inspire"
10652,HELEN:,"Sounds, which my skill could ne'er awaken;                           _1140"
10653,HELEN:,"And first, I felt my fingers sweep"
10654,HELEN:,"The harp, and a long quivering cry"
10655,HELEN:,Burst from my lips in symphony:
10656,HELEN:,"The dusk and solid air was shaken,"
10657,HELEN:,As swift and swifter the notes came                                  _1145
10658,HELEN:,"From my touch, that wandered like quick flame,"
10659,HELEN:,"And from my bosom, labouring"
10660,HELEN:,With some unutterable thing:
10661,HELEN:,The awful sound of my own voice made
10662,HELEN:,My faint lips tremble; in some mood                                  _1150
10663,HELEN:,Of wordless thought Lionel stood
10664,HELEN:,"So pale, that even beside his cheek"
10665,HELEN:,The snowy column from its shade
10666,HELEN:,"Caught whiteness: yet his countenance,"
10667,HELEN:,"Raised upward, burned with radiance                                  _1155"
10668,HELEN:,"Of spirit-piercing joy, whose light,"
10669,HELEN:,Like the moon struggling through the night
10670,HELEN:,"Of whirlwind-rifted clouds, did break"
10671,HELEN:,With beams that might not be confined.
10672,HELEN:,"I paused, but soon his gestures kindled                              _1160"
10673,HELEN:,"New power, as by the moving wind"
10674,HELEN:,"The waves are lifted, and my song"
10675,HELEN:,"To low soft notes now changed and dwindled,"
10676,HELEN:,"And from the twinkling wires among,"
10677,HELEN:,My languid fingers drew and flung                                    _1165
10678,HELEN:,"Circles of life-dissolving sound,"
10679,HELEN:,Yet faint; in aery rings they bound
10680,HELEN:,"My Lionel, who, as every strain"
10681,HELEN:,"Grew fainter but more sweet, his mien"
10682,HELEN:,Sunk with the sound relaxedly;                                       _1170
10683,HELEN:,"And slowly now he turned to me,"
10684,HELEN:,As slowly faded from his face
10685,HELEN:,That awful joy: with looks serene
10686,HELEN:,"He was soon drawn to my embrace,"
10687,HELEN:,And my wild song then died away                                      _1175
10688,HELEN:,In murmurs: words I dare not say
10689,HELEN:,"We mixed, and on his lips mine fed"
10690,HELEN:,Till they methought felt still and cold:
10691,HELEN:,"'What is it with thee, love?' I said:"
10692,HELEN:,"No word, no look, no motion! yes,                                    _1180"
10693,HELEN:,"There was a change, but spare to guess,"
10694,HELEN:,Nor let that moment's hope be told.
10695,HELEN:,"I looked, and knew that he was dead,"
10696,HELEN:,"And fell, as the eagle on the plain"
10697,HELEN:,"Falls when life deserts her brain,                                   _1185"
10698,HELEN:,And the mortal lightning is veiled again.
10699,HELEN:,
10700,HELEN:,O that I were now dead! but such
10701,HELEN:,"(Did they not, love, demand too much,"
10702,HELEN:,Those dying murmurs?) he forbade.
10703,HELEN:,O that I once again were mad!                                        _1190
10704,HELEN:,"And yet, dear Rosalind, not so,"
10705,HELEN:,For I would live to share thy woe.
10706,HELEN:,Sweet boy! did I forget thee too?
10707,HELEN:,"Alas, we know not what we do"
10708,HELEN:,When we speak words.
10709,HELEN:,No memory more                                                       _1195
10710,HELEN:,Is in my mind of that sea shore.
10711,HELEN:,"Madness came on me, and a troop"
10712,HELEN:,Of misty shapes did seem to sit
10713,HELEN:,"Beside me, on a vessel's poop,"
10714,HELEN:,And the clear north wind was driving it.                             _1200
10715,HELEN:,"Then I heard strange tongues, and saw strange flowers,"
10716,HELEN:,"And the stars methought grew unlike ours,"
10717,HELEN:,And the azure sky and the stormless sea
10718,HELEN:,"Made me believe that I had died,"
10719,HELEN:,"And waked in a world, which was to me                                _1205"
10720,HELEN:,"Drear hell, though heaven to all beside:"
10721,HELEN:,"Then a dead sleep fell on my mind,"
10722,HELEN:,Whilst animal life many long years
10723,HELEN:,Had rescued from a chasm of tears;
10724,HELEN:,"And when I woke, I wept to find                                      _1210"
10725,HELEN:,"That the same lady, bright and wise,"
10726,HELEN:,"With silver locks and quick brown eyes,"
10727,HELEN:,"The mother of my Lionel,"
10728,HELEN:,"Had tended me in my distress,"
10729,HELEN:,And died some months before. Nor less                                _1215
10730,HELEN:,"Wonder, but far more peace and joy,"
10731,HELEN:,Brought in that hour my lovely boy;
10732,HELEN:,For through that trance my soul had well
10733,HELEN:,The impress of thy being kept;
10734,HELEN:,"And if I waked, or if I slept,                                       _1220"
10735,HELEN:,"No doubt, though memory faithless be,"
10736,HELEN:,Thy image ever dwelt on me;
10737,HELEN:,"And thus, O Lionel, like thee"
10738,HELEN:,Is our sweet child. 'Tis sure most strange
10739,HELEN:,"I knew not of so great a change,                                     _1225"
10740,HELEN:,"As that which gave him birth, who now"
10741,HELEN:,Is all the solace of my woe.
10742,HELEN:,
10743,HELEN:,That Lionel great wealth had left
10744,HELEN:,"By will to me, and that of all"
10745,HELEN:,The ready lies of law bereft                                         _1230
10746,HELEN:,"My child and me, might well befall."
10747,HELEN:,"But let me think not of the scorn,"
10748,HELEN:,"Which from the meanest I have borne,"
10749,HELEN:,"When, for my child's beloved sake,"
10750,HELEN:,"I mixed with slaves, to vindicate                                    _1235"
10751,HELEN:,The very laws themselves do make:
10752,HELEN:,"Let me not say scorn is my fate,"
10753,HELEN:,"Lest I be proud, suffering the same"
10754,HELEN:,With those who live in deathless fame.
10755,HELEN:,
10756,HELEN:,"She ceased.--'Lo, where red morning thro' the woods                  _1240"
10757,HELEN:,Is burning o'er the dew;' said Rosalind.
10758,HELEN:,"And with these words they rose, and towards the flood"
10759,HELEN:,"Of the blue lake, beneath the leaves now wind"
10760,HELEN:,With equal steps and fingers intertwined:
10761,HELEN:,"Thence to a lonely dwelling, where the shore                         _1245"
10762,HELEN:,"Is shadowed with steep rocks, and cypresses"
10763,HELEN:,"Cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies,"
10764,HELEN:,"And with their shadows the clear depths below,"
10765,HELEN:,"And where a little terrace from its bowers,"
10766,HELEN:,"Of blooming myrtle and faint lemon-flowers,                          _1250"
10767,HELEN:,Scatters its sense-dissolving fragrance o'er
10768,HELEN:,The liquid marble of the windless lake;
10769,HELEN:,"And where the aged forest's limbs look hoar,"
10770,HELEN:,"Under the leaves which their green garments make,"
10771,HELEN:,"They come: 'Tis Helen's home, and clean and white,                   _1255"
10772,HELEN:,Like one which tyrants spare on our own land
10773,HELEN:,"In some such solitude, its casements bright"
10774,HELEN:,"Shone through their vine-leaves in the morning sun,"
10775,HELEN:,And even within 'twas scarce like Italy.
10776,HELEN:,"And when she saw how all things there were planned,                  _1260"
10777,HELEN:,"As in an English home, dim memory"
10778,HELEN:,Disturbed poor Rosalind: she stood as one
10779,HELEN:,"Whose mind is where his body cannot be,"
10780,HELEN:,"Till Helen led her where her child yet slept,"
10781,HELEN:,"And said, 'Observe, that brow was Lionel's,                          _1265"
10782,HELEN:,"Those lips were his, and so he ever kept"
10783,HELEN:,"One arm in sleep, pillowing his head with it."
10784,HELEN:,You cannot see his eyes--they are two wells
10785,HELEN:,Of liquid love: let us not wake him yet.'
10786,HELEN:,"But Rosalind could bear no more, and wept                            _1270"
10787,HELEN:,"A shower of burning tears, which fell upon"
10788,HELEN:,"His face, and so his opening lashes shone"
10789,HELEN:,"With tears unlike his own, as he did leap"
10790,HELEN:,In sudden wonder from his innocent sleep.
10791,HELEN:,
10792,HELEN:,So Rosalind and Helen lived together                                 _1275
10793,HELEN:,"Thenceforth, changed in all else, yet friends again,"
10794,HELEN:,"Such as they were, when o'er the mountain heather"
10795,HELEN:,"They wandered in their youth, through sun and rain."
10796,HELEN:,"And after many years, for human things"
10797,HELEN:,"Change even like the ocean and the wind,                             _1280"
10798,HELEN:,"Her daughter was restored to Rosalind,"
10799,HELEN:,And in their circle thence some visitings
10800,HELEN:,Of joy 'mid their new calm would intervene:
10801,HELEN:,"A lovely child she was, of looks serene,"
10802,HELEN:,And motions which o'er things indifferent shed                       _1285
10803,HELEN:,The grace and gentleness from whence they came.
10804,HELEN:,"And Helen's boy grew with her, and they fed"
10805,HELEN:,"From the same flowers of thought, until each mind"
10806,HELEN:,"Like springs which mingle in one flood became,"
10807,HELEN:,And in their union soon their parents saw                            _1290
10808,HELEN:,The shadow of the peace denied to them.
10809,HELEN:,"And Rosalind, for when the living stem"
10810,HELEN:,"Is cankered in its heart, the tree must fall,"
10811,HELEN:,Died ere her time; and with deep grief and awe
10812,HELEN:,The pale survivors followed her remains                              _1295
10813,HELEN:,"Beyond the region of dissolving rains,"
10814,HELEN:,Up the cold mountain she was wont to call
10815,HELEN:,Her tomb; and on Chiavenna's precipice
10816,HELEN:,"They raised a pyramid of lasting ice,"
10817,HELEN:,"Whose polished sides, ere day had yet begun,                         _1300"
10818,HELEN:,"Caught the first glow of the unrisen sun,"
10819,HELEN:,"The last, when it had sunk; and thro' the night"
10820,HELEN:,The charioteers of Arctos wheeled round
10821,HELEN:,"Its glittering point, as seen from Helen's home,"
10822,HELEN:,"Whose sad inhabitants each year would come,                          _1305"
10823,HELEN:,"With willing steps climbing that rugged height,"
10824,HELEN:,"And hang long locks of hair, and garlands bound"
10825,HELEN:,"With amaranth flowers, which, in the clime's despite,"
10826,HELEN:,Filled the frore air with unaccustomed light:
10827,HELEN:,"Such flowers, as in the wintry memory bloom                          _1310"
10828,HELEN:,"Of one friend left, adorned that frozen tomb."
10829,HELEN:,
10830,HELEN:,"Helen, whose spirit was of softer mould,"
10831,HELEN:,"Whose sufferings too were less, Death slowlier led"
10832,HELEN:,Into the peace of his dominion cold:
10833,HELEN:,"She died among her kindred, being old.                               _1315"
10834,HELEN:,"And know, that if love die not in the dead"
10835,HELEN:,"As in the living, none of mortal kind"
10836,HELEN:,"Are blest, as now Helen and Rosalind."

10855,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"""Rosalind and Helen"" was begun at Marlow, and thrown aside--till I"
10856,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"found it; and, at my request, it was completed. Shelley had no care"
10857,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind,"
10858,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,and develop some high or abstruse truth. When he does touch on human
10859,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"life and the human heart, no pictures can be more faithful, more"
10860,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"delicate, more subtle, or more pathetic. He never mentioned Love but"
10861,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature, that scarcely any other"
10862,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,poet has bestowed on that passion. When he spoke of it as the law of
10863,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"life, which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves"
10864,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"and others, he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable"
10865,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"truth. In his eyes it was the essence of our being, and all woe and"
10866,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness, or"
10867,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"insensibility, or mistake. By reverting in his mind to this first"
10868,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"principle, he discovered the source of many emotions, and could"
10869,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"disclose the secrets of all hearts, and his delineations of passion"
10870,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature.

10906,PREFACE.,
10907,PREFACE.,Count Maddalo is a Venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great
10908,PREFACE.,"fortune, who, without mixing much in the society of his countrymen,"
10909,PREFACE.,resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city. He is a person
10910,PREFACE.,"of the most consummate genius, and capable, if he would direct his"
10911,PREFACE.,"energies to such an end, of becoming the redeemer of his degraded"
10912,PREFACE.,"country. But it is his weakness to be proud: he derives, from a"
10913,PREFACE.,comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects
10914,PREFACE.,"that surround him, an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human"
10915,PREFACE.,life. His passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those
10916,PREFACE.,"of other men; and, instead of the latter having been employed in"
10917,PREFACE.,"curbing the former, they have mutually lent each other strength. His"
10918,PREFACE.,"ambition preys upon itself, for want of objects which it can consider"
10919,PREFACE.,"worthy of exertion. I say that Maddalo is proud, because I can find no"
10920,PREFACE.,other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which
10921,PREFACE.,consume him; but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he
10922,PREFACE.,"seems to trample, for in social life no human being can be more"
10923,PREFACE.,"gentle, patient and unassuming than Maddalo. He is cheerful, frank and"
10924,PREFACE.,witty. His more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication; men
10925,PREFACE.,are held by it as by a spell. He has travelled much; and there is an
10926,PREFACE.,inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different
10927,PREFACE.,countries.

10932,PREFACE.,"moral superstitions, human society may be yet susceptible. Without"
10933,PREFACE.,concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good
10934,PREFACE.,"may be made superior. He is a complete infidel, and a scoffer at all"
10935,PREFACE.,things reputed holy; and Maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing
10936,PREFACE.,out his taunts against religion. What Maddalo thinks on these matters
10937,PREFACE.,"is not exactly known. Julian, in spite of his heterodox opinions, is"
10938,PREFACE.,conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities. How far
10939,PREFACE.,this is possible the pious reader will determine. Julian is rather

10945,PREFACE.,"length, might be like many other stories of the same kind: the"
10946,PREFACE.,unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a
10947,PREFACE.,sufficient comment for the text of every heart.

10970,PREFACE.,To ride as then I rode;--for the winds drove
10971,PREFACE.,The living spray along the sunny air

11097,PREFACE.,"Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam"
11098,PREFACE.,"With such deep meaning, as we never see"
11099,PREFACE.,But in the human countenance: with me                                _150
11100,PREFACE.,She was a special favourite: I had nursed
11101,PREFACE.,Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first

11103,PREFACE.,"On second sight her ancient playfellow,"
11104,PREFACE.,Less changed than she was by six months or so;                       _155
11105,PREFACE.,For after her first shyness was worn out
11106,PREFACE.,"We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,"
11107,PREFACE.,When the Count entered. Salutations past--
11108,PREFACE.,'The word you spoke last night might well have cast

11116,PREFACE.,"This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;"
11117,PREFACE.,"She spends a happy time with little care,"
11118,PREFACE.,While we to such sick thoughts subjected are

11125,PREFACE.,Should we be less in deed than in desire?'
11126,PREFACE.,"'Ay, if we were not weak--and we aspire"
11127,PREFACE.,How vainly to be strong!' said Maddalo:
11128,PREFACE.,"'You talk Utopia.' 'It remains to know,'"
11129,PREFACE.,"I then rejoined, 'and those who try may find                         _180"

11131,PREFACE.,Brittle perchance as straw...We are assured
11132,PREFACE.,"Much may be conquered, much may be endured,"
11133,PREFACE.,Of what degrades and crushes us. We know
11134,PREFACE.,That we have power over ourselves to do                              _185

11139,PREFACE.,And those who suffer with their suffering kind                       _190

11142,PREFACE.,"To your opinion, though I think you might"
11143,PREFACE.,Make such a system refutation-tight

11149,PREFACE.,"We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show                         _200"
11150,PREFACE.,How vain are such aspiring theories.'
11151,PREFACE.,"'I hope to prove the induction otherwise,"
11152,PREFACE.,"And that a want of that true theory, still,"
11153,PREFACE.,"Which seeks a ""soul of goodness"" in things ill"

11161,PREFACE.,As thus I spoke
11162,PREFACE.,"Servants announced the gondola, and we"
11163,PREFACE.,Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
11164,PREFACE.,Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands.

11167,PREFACE.,"And laughter where complaint had merrier been,"
11168,PREFACE.,"Moans, shrieks, and curses, and blaspheming prayers"
11169,PREFACE.,Accosted us. We climbed the oozy stairs
11170,PREFACE.,"Into an old courtyard. I heard on high,                              _220"
11171,PREFACE.,"Then, fragments of most touching melody,"
11172,PREFACE.,But looking up saw not the singer there--
11173,PREFACE.,Through the black bars in the tempestuous air
11174,PREFACE.,"I saw, like weeds on a wrecked palace growing,"
11175,PREFACE.,"Long tangled locks flung wildly forth, and flowing,                  _225"
11176,PREFACE.,Of those who on a sudden were beguiled
11177,PREFACE.,"Into strange silence, and looked forth and smiled"
11178,PREFACE.,Hearing sweet sounds. Then I: 'Methinks there were
11179,PREFACE.,"A cure of these with patience and kind care,"
11180,PREFACE.,If music can thus move...but what is he                              _230
11181,PREFACE.,Whom we seek here?' 'Of his sad history
11182,PREFACE.,"I know but this,' said Maddalo: 'he came"

11185,PREFACE.,Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe;                    _235
11186,PREFACE.,But he was ever talking in such sort
11187,PREFACE.,"As you do--far more sadly--he seemed hurt,"
11188,PREFACE.,"Even as a man with his peculiar wrong,"
11189,PREFACE.,"To hear but of the oppression of the strong,"

11238,PREFACE.,If sent to distant lands: and then as one

11657,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"in the neighbourhood of that city, he accepted the offer of Lord"

11661,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"I Capuccini was a villa built on the site of a Capuchin convent,"
11662,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,demolished when the French suppressed religious houses; it was
11663,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,situated on the very overhanging brow of a low hill at the foot of a
11664,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,range of higher ones. The house was cheerful and pleasant; a
11665,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"vine-trellised walk, a pergola, as it is called in Italian, led from"
11666,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"the hall-door to a summer-house at the end of the garden, which"
11667,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"Shelley made his study, and in which he began the ""Prometheus""; and"
11668,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"here also, as he mentions in a letter, he wrote ""Julian and Maddalo""."
11669,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"A slight ravine, with a road in its depth, divided the garden from the"
11670,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"hill, on which stood the ruins of the ancient castle of Este, whose"
11671,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"dark massive wall gave forth an echo, and from whose ruined crevices"
11672,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"owls and bats flitted forth at night, as the crescent moon sunk behind"
11673,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,the black and heavy battlements. We looked from the garden over the
11674,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"wide plain of Lombardy, bounded to the west by the far Apennines,"
11675,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,while to the east the horizon was lost in misty distance. After the
11676,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"picturesque but limited view of mountain, ravine, and chestnut-wood,"
11677,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"at the Baths of Lucca, there was something infinitely gratifying to"
11678,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,the eye in the wide range of prospect commanded by our new abode.

11680,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"Our first misfortune, of the kind from which we soon suffered even"
11681,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"more severely, happened here. Our little girl, an infant in whose"
11682,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,small features I fancied that I traced great resemblance to her
11683,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"father, showed symptoms of suffering from the heat of the climate."
11684,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"Teething increased her illness and danger. We were at Este, and when"
11685,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"we became alarmed, hastened to Venice for the best advice. When we"
11686,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,"arrived at Fusina, we found that we had forgotten our passport, and"
11687,NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY.,the soldiers on duty attempted to prevent our crossing the laguna; but

11721,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
11722,PREFACE.,
11723,PREFACE.,"The Greek tragic writers, in selecting as their subject any portion of"
11724,PREFACE.,"their national history or mythology, employed in their treatment of it"
11725,PREFACE.,a certain arbitrary discretion. They by no means conceived themselves
11726,PREFACE.,bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as
11727,PREFACE.,in title their rivals and predecessors. Such a system would have
11728,PREFACE.,amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their
11729,PREFACE.,competitors which incited the composition. The Agamemnonian story was
11730,PREFACE.,exhibited on the Athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas.
11731,PREFACE.,
11732,PREFACE.,"I have presumed to employ a similar license. The ""Prometheus Unbound"""
11733,PREFACE.,of Aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of Jupiter with his victim as
11734,PREFACE.,the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by
11735,PREFACE.,"the consummation of his marriage with Thetis. Thetis, according to"
11736,PREFACE.,"this view of the subject, was given in marriage to Peleus, and"
11737,PREFACE.,"Prometheus, by the permission of Jupiter, delivered from his captivity"
11738,PREFACE.,"by Hercules. Had I framed my story on this model, I should have done"
11739,PREFACE.,no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of Aeschylus; an
11740,PREFACE.,"ambition which, if my preference to this mode of treating the subject"
11741,PREFACE.,"had incited me to cherish, the recollection of the high comparison"
11742,PREFACE.,"such an attempt would challenge might well abate. But, in truth, I was"
11743,PREFACE.,averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the
11744,PREFACE.,Champion with the Oppressor of mankind. The moral interest of the
11745,PREFACE.,"fable, which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and"
11746,PREFACE.,"endurance of Prometheus, would be annihilated if we could conceive of"
11747,PREFACE.,him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful
11748,PREFACE.,and perfidious adversary. The only imaginary being resembling in any
11749,PREFACE.,"degree Prometheus, is Satan; and Prometheus is, in my judgement, a"
11750,PREFACE.,"more poetical character than Satan, because, in addition to courage,"
11751,PREFACE.,"and majesty, and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force, he"
11752,PREFACE.,is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of
11753,PREFACE.,"ambition, envy, revenge, and a desire for personal aggrandisement,"
11754,PREFACE.,"which, in the Hero of ""Paradise Lost"", interfere with the interest."
11755,PREFACE.,The character of Satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry
11756,PREFACE.,"which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs, and to excuse the"
11757,PREFACE.,former because the latter exceed all measure. In the minds of those
11758,PREFACE.,who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it
11759,PREFACE.,"engenders something worse. But Prometheus is, as it were, the type of"
11760,PREFACE.,"the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by"
11761,PREFACE.,the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends.
11762,PREFACE.,
11763,PREFACE.,This Poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the Baths
11764,PREFACE.,"of Caracalla, among the flowery glades, and thickets of odoriferous"
11765,PREFACE.,"blossoming trees, which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon"
11766,PREFACE.,its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air. The
11767,PREFACE.,"bright blue sky of Rome, and the effect of the vigorous awakening"
11768,PREFACE.,"spring in that divinest climate, and the new life with which it"
11769,PREFACE.,"drenches the spirits even to intoxication, were the inspiration of"
11770,PREFACE.,this drama.
11771,PREFACE.,
11772,PREFACE.,"The imagery which I have employed will be found, in many instances, to"
11773,PREFACE.,"have been drawn from the operations of the human mind, or from those"
11774,PREFACE.,external actions by which they are expressed. This is unusual in
11775,PREFACE.,"modern poetry, although Dante and Shakespeare are full of instances of"
11776,PREFACE.,"the same kind: Dante indeed more than any other poet, and with greater"
11777,PREFACE.,"success. But the Greek poets, as writers to whom no resource of"
11778,PREFACE.,"awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown, were in"
11779,PREFACE.,the habitual use of this power; and it is the study of their works
11780,PREFACE.,(since a higher merit would probably be denied me) to which I am
11781,PREFACE.,willing that my readers should impute this singularity.
11782,PREFACE.,
11783,PREFACE.,One word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of
11784,PREFACE.,"contemporary writings may have tinged my composition, for such has"
11785,PREFACE.,"been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular, and"
11786,PREFACE.,"indeed more deservedly popular, than mine. It is impossible that any"
11787,PREFACE.,one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in
11788,PREFACE.,"the foremost ranks of our own, can conscientiously assure himself that"
11789,PREFACE.,his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the
11790,PREFACE.,study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects. It is
11791,PREFACE.,"true, that, not the spirit of their genius, but the forms in which it"
11792,PREFACE.,"has manifested itself, are due less to the peculiarities of their own"
11793,PREFACE.,minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition
11794,PREFACE.,of the minds among which they have been produced. Thus a number of
11795,PREFACE.,"writers possess the form, whilst they want the spirit of those whom,"
11796,PREFACE.,"it is alleged, they imitate; because the former is the endowment of"
11797,PREFACE.,"the age in which they live, and the latter must be the uncommunicated"
11798,PREFACE.,lightning of their own mind.
11799,PREFACE.,
11800,PREFACE.,The peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which
11801,PREFACE.,"distinguishes the modern literature of England has not been, as a"
11802,PREFACE.,"general power, the product of the imitation of any particular writer."
11803,PREFACE.,The mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same;
11804,PREFACE.,the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change. If
11805,PREFACE.,"England were divided into forty republics, each equal in population"
11806,PREFACE.,"and extent to Athens, there is no reason to suppose but that, under"
11807,PREFACE.,"institutions not more perfect than those of Athens, each would produce"
11808,PREFACE.,philosophers and poets equal to those who (if we except Shakespeare)
11809,PREFACE.,have never been surpassed. We owe the great writers of the golden age
11810,PREFACE.,of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which
11811,PREFACE.,shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the Christian
11812,PREFACE.,religion. We owe Milton to the progress and development of the same
11813,PREFACE.,"spirit: the sacred Milton was, let it ever be remembered, a"
11814,PREFACE.,"republican, and a bold inquirer into morals and religion. The great"
11815,PREFACE.,"writers of our own age are, we have reason to suppose, the companions"
11816,PREFACE.,and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or
11817,PREFACE.,the opinions which cement it. The cloud of mind is discharging its
11818,PREFACE.,"collected lightning, and the equilibrium between institutions and"
11819,PREFACE.,"opinions is now restoring, or is about to be restored."
11820,PREFACE.,
11821,PREFACE.,"As to imitation, poetry is a mimetic art. It creates, but it creates"
11822,PREFACE.,by combination and representation. Poetical abstractions are beautiful
11823,PREFACE.,"and new, not because the portions of which they are composed had no"
11824,PREFACE.,"previous existence in the mind of man or in nature, but because the"
11825,PREFACE.,whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and
11826,PREFACE.,"beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought, and with"
11827,PREFACE.,the contemporary condition of them: one great poet is a masterpiece of
11828,PREFACE.,nature which another not only ought to study but must study. He might
11829,PREFACE.,as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be
11830,PREFACE.,the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude
11831,PREFACE.,from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a
11832,PREFACE.,great contemporary. The pretence of doing it would be a presumption in
11833,PREFACE.,"any but the greatest; the effect, even in him, would be strained,"
11834,PREFACE.,unnatural and ineffectual. A poet is the combined product of such
11835,PREFACE.,internal powers as modify the nature of others; and of such external
11836,PREFACE.,"influences as excite and sustain these powers; he is not one, but"
11837,PREFACE.,"both. Every man's mind is, in this respect, modified by all the"
11838,PREFACE.,objects of nature and art; by every word and every suggestion which he
11839,PREFACE.,ever admitted to act upon his consciousness; it is the mirror upon
11840,PREFACE.,"which all forms are reflected, and in which they compose one form."
11841,PREFACE.,"Poets, not otherwise than philosophers, painters, sculptors and"
11842,PREFACE.,"musicians, are, in one sense, the creators, and, in another, the"
11843,PREFACE.,"creations, of their age. From this subjection the loftiest do not"
11844,PREFACE.,"escape. There is a similarity between Homer and Hesiod, between"
11845,PREFACE.,"Aeschylus and Euripides, between Virgil and Horace, between Dante and"
11846,PREFACE.,"Petrarch, between Shakespeare and Fletcher, between Dryden and Pope;"
11847,PREFACE.,each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions
11848,PREFACE.,"are arranged. If this similarity be the result of imitation, I am"
11849,PREFACE.,willing to confess that I have imitated.
11850,PREFACE.,
11851,PREFACE.,"Let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that I have,"
11852,PREFACE.,"what a Scotch philosopher characteristically terms, 'a passion for"
11853,PREFACE.,reforming the world:' what passion incited him to write and publish
11854,PREFACE.,"his book, he omits to explain. For my part I had rather be damned with"
11855,PREFACE.,"Plato and Lord Bacon, than go to Heaven with Paley and Malthus. But it"
11856,PREFACE.,is a mistake to suppose that I dedicate my poetical compositions
11857,PREFACE.,"solely to the direct enforcement of reform, or that I consider them in"
11858,PREFACE.,any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human
11859,PREFACE.,life. Didactic poetry is my abhorrence; nothing can be equally well
11860,PREFACE.,expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse. My
11861,PREFACE.,purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined
11862,PREFACE.,imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with
11863,PREFACE.,beautiful idealisms of moral excellence; aware that until the mind can
11864,PREFACE.,"love, and admire, and trust, and hope, and endure, reasoned principles"
11865,PREFACE.,of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the
11866,PREFACE.,"unconscious passenger tramples into dust, although they would bear the"
11867,PREFACE.,"harvest of his happiness. Should I live to accomplish what I purpose,"
11868,PREFACE.,"that is, produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the"
11869,PREFACE.,"genuine elements of human society, let not the advocates of injustice"
11870,PREFACE.,and superstition flatter themselves that I should take Aeschylus
11871,PREFACE.,rather than Plato as my model.
11872,PREFACE.,
11873,PREFACE.,The having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little
11874,PREFACE.,apology with the candid; and let the uncandid consider that they
11875,PREFACE.,injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation.
11876,PREFACE.,"Whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others, be"
11877,PREFACE.,"they ever so inconsiderable, he is yet bound to exert them: if his"
11878,PREFACE.,"attempt be ineffectual, let the punishment of an unaccomplished"
11879,PREFACE.,purpose have been sufficient; let none trouble themselves to heap the
11880,PREFACE.,dust of oblivion upon his efforts; the pile they raise will betray his
11881,PREFACE.,grave which might otherwise have been unknown.

15660,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",on all such weakness; but for the sake of those to whom my life may be

15663,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15664,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",In almost every respect his journey to Italy was advantageous. He left
15665,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","behind friends to whom he was attached; but cares of a thousand kinds,"
15666,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","many springing from his lavish generosity, crowded round him in his"
15667,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","native country, and, except the society of one or two friends, he had"
15668,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",no compensation. The climate caused him to consume half his existence
15669,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","in helpless suffering. His dearest pleasure, the free enjoyment of the"
15670,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","scenes of Nature, was marred by the same circumstance."
15671,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15672,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","He went direct to Italy, avoiding even Paris, and did not make any"
15673,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",pause till he arrived at Milan. The first aspect of Italy enchanted
15674,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Shelley; it seemed a garden of delight placed beneath a clearer and
15675,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",brighter heaven than any he had lived under before. He wrote long
15676,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","descriptive letters during the first year of his residence in Italy,"
15677,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","which, as compositions, are the most beautiful in the world, and show"
15678,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of Nature and Art in
15679,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",that divine land.
15680,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15681,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",The poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and
15682,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",with more than all the beauty of his first attempts. He meditated
15683,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",three subjects as the groundwork for lyrical dramas. One was the story
15684,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",of Tasso; of this a slight fragment of a song of Tasso remains. The
15685,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","other was one founded on the Book of Job, which he never abandoned in"
15686,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","idea, but of which no trace remains among his papers. The third was"
15687,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the ""Prometheus Unbound"". The Greek tragedians were now his most"
15688,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","familiar companions in his wanderings, and the sublime majesty of"
15689,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Aeschylus filled him with wonder and delight. The father of Greek
15690,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","tragedy does not possess the pathos of Sophocles, nor the variety and"
15691,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",tenderness of Euripides; the interest on which he founds his dramas is
15692,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",often elevated above human vicissitudes into the mighty passions and
15693,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",throes of gods and demi-gods: such fascinated the abstract imagination
15694,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",of Shelley.
15695,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15696,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","We spent a month at Milan, visiting the Lake of Como during that"
15697,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","interval. Thence we passed in succession to Pisa, Leghorn, the Baths"
15698,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","of Lucca, Venice, Este, Rome, Naples, and back again to Rome, whither"
15699,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","we returned early in March, 1819. During all this time Shelley"
15700,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","meditated the subject of his drama, and wrote portions of it. Other"
15701,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","poems were composed during this interval, and while at the Bagni di"
15702,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Lucca he translated Plato's ""Symposium"". But, though he diversified"
15703,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","his studies, his thoughts centred in the Prometheus. At last, when at"
15704,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Rome, during a bright and beautiful Spring, he gave up his whole time"
15705,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","to the composition. The spot selected for his study was, as he"
15706,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","mentions in his preface, the mountainous ruins of the Baths of"
15707,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Caracalla. These are little known to the ordinary visitor at Rome. He
15708,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","describes them in a letter, with that poetry and delicacy and truth of"
15709,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",description which render his narrated impressions of scenery of
15710,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",unequalled beauty and interest.
15711,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15712,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",At first he completed the drama in three acts. It was not till several
15713,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","months after, when at Florence, that he conceived that a fourth act, a"
15714,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",sort of hymn of rejoicing in the fulfilment of the prophecies with
15715,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","regard to Prometheus, ought to be added to complete the composition."
15716,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15717,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",The prominent feature of Shelley's theory of the destiny of the human
15718,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","species was that evil is not inherent in the system of the creation,"
15719,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",but an accident that might be expelled. This also forms a portion of
15720,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Christianity: God made earth and man perfect, till he, by his fall,"
15721,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15722,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",'Brought death into the world and all our woe.'
15723,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15724,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Shelley believed that mankind had only to will that there should be no
15725,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","evil, and there would be none. It is not my part in these Notes to"
15726,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion, but to"
15727,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","mention the fact that he entertained it, and was indeed attached to it"
15728,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",with fervent enthusiasm. That man could be so perfectionized as to be
15729,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","able to expel evil from his own nature, and from the greater part of"
15730,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the creation, was the cardinal point of his system. And the subject he"
15731,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",loved best to dwell on was the image of One warring with the Evil
15732,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Principle, oppressed not only by it, but by all--even the good, who"
15733,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",were deluded into considering evil a necessary portion of humanity; a
15734,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating
15735,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of Good. Such he had
15736,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","depicted in his last poem, when he made Laon the enemy and the victim"
15737,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",of tyrants. He now took a more idealized image of the same subject. He
15738,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",followed certain classical authorities in figuring Saturn as the good
15739,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","principle, Jupiter the usurping evil one, and Prometheus as the"
15740,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","regenerator, who, unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence,"
15741,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","used knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil, by leading mankind, beyond"
15742,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance, to that in which"
15743,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",they are virtuous through wisdom. Jupiter punished the temerity of the
15744,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Titan by chaining him to a rock of Caucasus, and causing a vulture to"
15745,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",devour his still-renewed heart. There was a prophecy afloat in heaven
15746,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","portending the fall of Jove, the secret of averting which was known"
15747,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",only to Prometheus; and the god offered freedom from torture on
15748,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",condition of its being communicated to him. According to the
15749,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","mythological story, this referred to the offspring of Thetis, who was"
15750,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",destined to be greater than his father. Prometheus at last bought
15751,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","pardon for his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts, by revealing"
15752,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the prophecy. Hercules killed the vulture, and set him free; and"
15753,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Thetis was married to Peleus, the father of Achilles."
15754,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15755,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views.
15756,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","The son greater than his father, born of the nuptials of Jupiter and"
15757,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Thetis, was to dethrone Evil, and bring back a happier reign than that"
15758,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","of Saturn. Prometheus defies the power of his enemy, and endures"
15759,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","centuries of torture; till the hour arrives when Jove, blind to the"
15760,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","real event, but darkly guessing that some great good to himself will"

15762,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","drives him from his usurped throne, and Strength, in the person of"
15763,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Hercules, liberates Humanity, typified in Prometheus, from the"
15764,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","tortures generated by evil done or suffered. Asia, one of the"

15766,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","mythological interpretations, the same as Venus and Nature. When the"
15767,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","benefactor of mankind is liberated, Nature resumes the beauty of her"
15768,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","prime, and is united to her husband, the emblem of the human race, in"
15769,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","perfect and happy union. In the Fourth Act, the Poet gives further"
15770,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","scope to his imagination, and idealizes the forms of creation--such as"
15771,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","we know them, instead of such as they appeared to the Greeks. Maternal"
15772,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Earth, the mighty parent, is superseded by the Spirit of the Earth,"

15775,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",from the annihilation of Evil in the superior sphere.
15776,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15777,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Shelley develops, more particularly in the lyrics of this drama, his"
15778,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the Creation. It
15779,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",requires a mind as subtle and penetrating as his own to understand the
15780,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem. They elude the ordinary
15781,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction, but they are"
15782,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",far from vague. It was his design to write prose metaphysical essays
15783,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","on the nature of Man, which would have served to explain much of what"
15784,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",is obscure in his poetry; a few scattered fragments of observations
15785,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",and remarks alone remain. He considered these philosophical views of
15786,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Mind and Nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry.
15787,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
15788,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",More popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible
15789,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",imagery. Shelley loved to idealize the real--to gift the mechanism of
15790,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the material universe with a soul and a voice, and to bestow such also"
15791,"NOTE ON ""PROMETHEUS UNBOUND"", BY MRS. SHELLEY.",on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind.

15959,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
15960,PREFACE.,
15961,PREFACE.,"A manuscript was communicated to me during my travels in Italy, which"
15962,PREFACE.,"was copied from the archives of the Cenci Palace at Rome, and contains"
15963,PREFACE.,a detailed account of the horrors which ended in the extinction of one
15964,PREFACE.,of the noblest and richest families of that city during the
15965,PREFACE.,"Pontificate of Clement VIII, in the year 1599. The story is, that an"
15966,PREFACE.,"old man having spent his life in debauchery and wickedness, conceived"
15967,PREFACE.,at length an implacable hatred towards his children; which showed
15968,PREFACE.,"itself towards one daughter under the form of an incestuous passion,"
15969,PREFACE.,aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and violence. This
15970,PREFACE.,"daughter, after long and vain attempts to escape from what she"
15971,PREFACE.,"considered a perpetual contamination both of body and mind, at length"
15972,PREFACE.,plotted with her mother-in-law and brother to murder their common
15973,PREFACE.,"tyrant. The young maiden, who was urged to this tremendous deed by an"
15974,PREFACE.,"impulse which overpowered its horror, was evidently a most gentle and"
15975,PREFACE.,"amiable being, a creature formed to adorn and be admired, and thus"
15976,PREFACE.,violently thwarted from her nature by the necessity of circumstance
15977,PREFACE.,"and opinion. The deed was quickly discovered, and, in spite of the"
15978,PREFACE.,"most earnest prayers made to the Pope by the highest persons in Rome,"
15979,PREFACE.,the criminals were put to death. The old man had during his life
15980,PREFACE.,repeatedly bought his pardon from the Pope for capital crimes of the
15981,PREFACE.,"most enormous and unspeakable kind, at the price of a hundred thousand"
15982,PREFACE.,crowns; the death therefore of his victims can scarcely be accounted
15983,PREFACE.,"for by the love of justice. The Pope, among other motives for"
15984,PREFACE.,"severity, probably felt that whoever killed the Count Cenci deprived"
15985,PREFACE.,his treasury of a certain and copious source of revenue. (The Papal
15986,PREFACE.,Government formerly took the most extraordinary precautions against
15987,PREFACE.,the publicity of facts which offer so tragical a demonstration of its
15988,PREFACE.,own wickedness and weakness; so that the communication of the
15989,PREFACE.,"manuscript had become, until very lately, a matter of some"
15990,PREFACE.,"difficulty.) Such a story, if told so as to present to the reader all"
15991,PREFACE.,"the feelings of those who once acted it, their hopes and fears, their"
15992,PREFACE.,"confidences and misgivings, their various interests, passions, and"
15993,PREFACE.,"opinions, acting upon and with each other, yet all conspiring to one"
15994,PREFACE.,"tremendous end, would be as a light to make apparent some of the most"
15995,PREFACE.,dark and secret caverns of the human heart.
15996,PREFACE.,
15997,PREFACE.,On my arrival at Rome I found that the story of the Cenci was a
15998,PREFACE.,subject not to be mentioned in Italian society without awakening a
15999,PREFACE.,deep and breathless interest; and that the feelings of the company
16000,PREFACE.,"never failed to incline to a romantic pity for the wrongs, and a"
16001,PREFACE.,"passionate exculpation of the horrible deed to which they urged her,"
16002,PREFACE.,who has been mingled two centuries with the common dust. All ranks of
16003,PREFACE.,"people knew the outlines of this history, and participated in the"
16004,PREFACE.,overwhelming interest which it seems to have the magic of exciting in
16005,PREFACE.,the human heart. I had a copy of Guido's picture of Beatrice which is
16006,PREFACE.,"preserved in the Colonna Palace, and my servant instantly recognized"
16007,PREFACE.,it as the portrait of La Cenci.
16008,PREFACE.,
16009,PREFACE.,This national and universal interest which the story produces and has
16010,PREFACE.,produced for two centuries and among all ranks of people in a great
16011,PREFACE.,"City, where the imagination is kept for ever active and awake, first"
16012,PREFACE.,suggested to me the conception of its fitness for a dramatic purpose.
16013,PREFACE.,"In fact it is a tragedy which has already received, from its capacity"
16014,PREFACE.,"of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men, approbation and"
16015,PREFACE.,"success. Nothing remained as I imagined, but to clothe it to the"
16016,PREFACE.,apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action as would
16017,PREFACE.,bring it home to their hearts. The deepest and the sublimest tragic
16018,PREFACE.,"compositions, King Lear and the two plays in which the tale of Oedipus"
16019,PREFACE.,"is told, were stories which already existed in tradition, as matters"
16020,PREFACE.,"of popular belief and interest, before Shakspeare and Sophocles made"
16021,PREFACE.,them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of
16022,PREFACE.,mankind.
16023,PREFACE.,
16024,PREFACE.,This story of the Cenci is indeed eminently fearful and monstrous:
16025,PREFACE.,anything like a dry exhibition of it on the stage would be
16026,PREFACE.,insupportable. The person who would treat such a subject must increase
16027,PREFACE.,"the ideal, and diminish the actual horror of the events, so that the"
16028,PREFACE.,pleasure which arises from the poetry which exists in these
16029,PREFACE.,tempestuous sufferings and crimes may mitigate the pain of the
16030,PREFACE.,contemplation of the moral deformity from which they spring. There
16031,PREFACE.,must also be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to
16032,PREFACE.,what is vulgarly termed a moral purpose. The highest moral purpose
16033,PREFACE.,"aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the teaching the"
16034,PREFACE.,"human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the knowledge of"
16035,PREFACE.,"itself; in proportion to the possession of which knowledge, every"
16036,PREFACE.,"human being is wise, just, sincere, tolerant and kind. If dogmas can"
16037,PREFACE.,"do more, it is well: but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement"
16038,PREFACE.,"of them. Undoubtedly, no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of"
16039,PREFACE.,another; and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is
16040,PREFACE.,"kindness and forbearance, and a resolution to convert the injurer from"
16041,PREFACE.,"his dark passions by peace and love. Revenge, retaliation, atonement,"
16042,PREFACE.,are pernicious mistakes. If Beatrice had thought in this manner she
16043,PREFACE.,would have been wiser and better; but she would never have been a
16044,PREFACE.,tragic character: the few whom such an exhibition would have
16045,PREFACE.,"interested, could never have been sufficiently interested for a"
16046,PREFACE.,"dramatic purpose, from the want of finding sympathy in their interest"
16047,PREFACE.,among the mass who surround them. It is in the restless and
16048,PREFACE.,anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of
16049,PREFACE.,"Beatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs justification; it is"
16050,PREFACE.,in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her
16051,PREFACE.,"wrongs and their revenge, that the dramatic character of what she did"
16052,PREFACE.,"and suffered, consists."
16053,PREFACE.,
16054,PREFACE.,I have endeavoured as nearly as possible to represent the characters
16055,PREFACE.,"as they probably were, and have sought to avoid the error of making"
16056,PREFACE.,"them actuated by my own conceptions of right or wrong, false or true:"
16057,PREFACE.,thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth
16058,PREFACE.,century into cold impersonations of my own mind. They are represented
16059,PREFACE.,"as Catholics, and as Catholics deeply tinged with religion. To a"
16060,PREFACE.,Protestant apprehension there will appear something unnatural in the
16061,PREFACE.,earnest and perpetual sentiment of the relations between God and men
16062,PREFACE.,which pervade the tragedy of the Cenci. It will especially be startled
16063,PREFACE.,at the combination of an undoubting persuasion of the truth of the
16064,PREFACE.,popular religion with a cool and determined perseverance in enormous
16065,PREFACE.,"guilt. But religion in Italy is not, as in Protestant countries, a"
16066,PREFACE.,cloak to be worn on particular days; or a passport which those who do
16067,PREFACE.,not wish to be railed at carry with them to exhibit; or a gloomy
16068,PREFACE.,"passion for penetrating the impenetrable mysteries of our being, which"
16069,PREFACE.,terrifies its possessor at the darkness of the abyss to the brink of
16070,PREFACE.,"which it has conducted him. Religion coexists, as it were, in the mind"
16071,PREFACE.,"of an Italian Catholic, with a faith in that of which all men have the"
16072,PREFACE.,most certain knowledge. It is interwoven with the whole fabric of
16073,PREFACE.,"life. It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence, blind admiration;"
16074,PREFACE.,not a rule for moral conduct. It has no necessary connection with any
16075,PREFACE.,"one virtue. The most atrocious villain may be rigidly devout, and"
16076,PREFACE.,"without any shock to established faith, confess himself to be so."
16077,PREFACE.,"Religion pervades intensely the whole frame of society, and is"
16078,PREFACE.,"according to the temper of the mind which it inhabits, a passion, a"
16079,PREFACE.,"persuasion, an excuse, a refuge; never a check. Cenci himself built a"
16080,PREFACE.,"chapel in the court of his Palace, and dedicated it to St. Thomas the"
16081,PREFACE.,"Apostle, and established masses for the peace of his soul. Thus in the"
16082,PREFACE.,first scene of the fourth act Lucretia's design in exposing herself to
16083,PREFACE.,the consequences of an expostulation with Cenci after having
16084,PREFACE.,"administered the opiate, was to induce him by a feigned tale to"
16085,PREFACE.,confess himself before death; this being esteemed by Catholics as
16086,PREFACE.,essential to salvation; and she only relinquishes her purpose when she
16087,PREFACE.,perceives that her perseverance would expose Beatrice to new outrages.
16088,PREFACE.,
16089,PREFACE.,I have avoided with great care in writing this play the introduction
16090,PREFACE.,"of what is commonly called mere poetry, and I imagine there will"
16091,PREFACE.,"scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description,"
16092,PREFACE.,unless Beatrice's description of the chasm appointed for her father's
16093,PREFACE.,murder should be judged to be of that nature. (An idea in this speech
16094,PREFACE.,"was suggested by a most sublime passage in ""El Purgaterio de San"
16095,PREFACE.,"Patricio"" of Calderon; the only plagiarism which I have intentionally"
16096,PREFACE.,committed in the whole piece.)
16097,PREFACE.,
16098,PREFACE.,In a dramatic composition the imagery and the passion should
16099,PREFACE.,"interpenetrate one another, the former being reserved simply for the"
16100,PREFACE.,full development and illustration of the latter. Imagination is as the
16101,PREFACE.,immortal God which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal
16102,PREFACE.,passion. It is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery
16103,PREFACE.,may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the
16104,PREFACE.,"illustration of strong feeling, which raises what is low, and levels"
16105,PREFACE.,"to the apprehension that which is lofty, casting over all the shadow"
16106,PREFACE.,"of its own greatness. In other respects, I have written more"
16107,PREFACE.,"carelessly; that is, without an over-fastidious and learned choice of"
16108,PREFACE.,words. In this respect I entirely agree with those modern critics who
16109,PREFACE.,assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the
16110,PREFACE.,"familiar language of men, and that our great ancestors the ancient"
16111,PREFACE.,"English poets are the writers, a study of whom might incite us to do"
16112,PREFACE.,that for our own age which they have done for theirs. But it must be
16113,PREFACE.,the real language of men in general and not that of any particular
16114,PREFACE.,class to whose society the writer happens to belong. So much for what
16115,PREFACE.,I have attempted; I need not be assured that success is a very
16116,PREFACE.,different matter; particularly for one whose attention has but newly
16117,PREFACE.,been awakened to the study of dramatic literature.
16118,PREFACE.,
16119,PREFACE.,I endeavoured whilst at Rome to observe such monuments of this story
16120,PREFACE.,as might be accessible to a stranger. The portrait of Beatrice at the
16121,PREFACE.,Colonna Palace is admirable as a work of art: it was taken by Guido
16122,PREFACE.,during her confinement in prison. But it is most interesting as a just
16123,PREFACE.,representation of one of the loveliest specimens of the workmanship of
16124,PREFACE.,Nature. There is a fixed and pale composure upon the features: she
16125,PREFACE.,"seems sad and stricken down in spirit, yet the despair thus expressed"
16126,PREFACE.,is lightened by the patience of gentleness. Her head is bound with
16127,PREFACE.,folds of white drapery from which the yellow strings of her golden
16128,PREFACE.,"hair escape, and fall about her neck. The moulding of her face is"
16129,PREFACE.,exquisitely delicate; the eyebrows are distinct and arched: the lips
16130,PREFACE.,have that permanent meaning of imagination and sensibility which
16131,PREFACE.,suffering has not repressed and which it seems as if death scarcely
16132,PREFACE.,"could extinguish. Her forehead is large and clear; her eyes, which we"
16133,PREFACE.,"are told were remarkable for their vivacity, are swollen with weeping"
16134,PREFACE.,"and lustreless, but beautifully tender and serene. In the whole mien"
16135,PREFACE.,"there is a simplicity and dignity which, united with her exquisite"
16136,PREFACE.,"loveliness and deep sorrow, are inexpressibly pathetic. Beatrice Cenci"
16137,PREFACE.,appears to have been one of those rare persons in whom energy and
16138,PREFACE.,gentleness dwell together without destroying one another: her nature
16139,PREFACE.,was simple and profound. The crimes and miseries in which she was an
16140,PREFACE.,actor and a sufferer are as the mask and the mantle in which
16141,PREFACE.,circumstances clothed her for her impersonation on the scene of the
16142,PREFACE.,world.
16143,PREFACE.,
16144,PREFACE.,"The Cenci Palace is of great extent; and though in part modernized,"
16145,PREFACE.,there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture in the
16146,PREFACE.,same state as during the dreadful scenes which are the subject of this
16147,PREFACE.,"tragedy. The Palace is situated in an obscure corner of Rome, near the"
16148,PREFACE.,"quarter of the Jews, and from the upper windows you see the immense"
16149,PREFACE.,ruins of Mount Palatine half hidden under their profuse overgrowth of
16150,PREFACE.,trees. There is a court in one part of the Palace (perhaps that in
16151,PREFACE.,"which Cenci built the Chapel to St. Thomas), supported by granite"
16152,PREFACE.,"columns and adorned with antique friezes of fine workmanship, and"
16153,PREFACE.,"built up, according to the ancient Italian fashion, with balcony over"
16154,PREFACE.,balcony of open-work. One of the gates of the Palace formed of immense
16155,PREFACE.,"stones and leading through a passage, dark and lofty and opening into"
16156,PREFACE.,"gloomy subterranean chambers, struck me particularly."
16157,PREFACE.,

19970,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",one fitted for a tragedy. More than ever I felt my incompetence; but I
19971,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","entreated him to write it instead; and he began, and proceeded"
19972,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","swiftly, urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human"
19973,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","beings whose passions, so long cold in the tomb, he revived, and"
19974,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",gifted with poetic language. This tragedy is the only one of his works
19975,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",that he communicated to me during its progress. We talked over the
19976,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",arrangement of the scenes together. I speedily saw the great mistake
19977,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","we had made, and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought"
19978,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","to light from that mine of wealth (never, alas, through his untimely"

19984,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his

19994,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
19995,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of Leghorn,"
19996,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","and we took a small house, Villa Valsovano, about half-way between the"
19997,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","town and Monte Nero, where we remained during the summer. Our villa"
19998,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",was situated in the midst of a podere; the peasants sang as they
19999,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","worked beneath our windows, during the heats of a very hot season, and"
20000,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",in the evening the water-wheel creaked as the process of irrigation
20001,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","went on, and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges:"
20002,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Nature was bright, sunshiny, and cheerful, or diversified by storms of"
20003,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","a majestic terror, such as we had never before witnessed."
20004,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20005,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",At the top of the house there was a sort of terrace. There is often
20006,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","such in Italy, generally roofed: this one was very small, yet not only"
20007,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",roofed but glazed. This Shelley made his study; it looked out on a
20008,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","wide prospect of fertile country, and commanded a view of the near"
20009,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",sea. The storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most
20010,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean; sometimes the dark
20011,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","lurid clouds dipped towards the waves, and became water-spouts that"
20012,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","churned up the waters beneath, as they were chased onward and"
20013,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",scattered by the tempest. At other times the dazzling sunlight and
20014,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",heat made it almost intolerable to every other; but Shelley basked in
20015,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","both, and his health and spirits revived under their influence. In"
20016,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","this airy cell he wrote the principal part of ""The Cenci"". He was"
20017,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","making a study of Calderon at the time, reading his best tragedies"
20018,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","with an accomplished lady living near us, to whom his letter from"
20019,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Leghorn was addressed during the following year. He admired Calderon,"
20020,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",both for his poetry and his dramatic genius; but it shows his
20021,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","judgement and originality that, though greatly struck by his first"
20022,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","acquaintance with the Spanish poet, none of his peculiarities crept"
20023,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","into the composition of ""The Cenci""; and there is no trace of his new"
20024,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","studies, except in that passage to which he himself alludes as"
20025,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","suggested by one in ""El Purgatorio de San Patricio""."
20026,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20027,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Shelley wished ""The Cenci"" to be acted. He was not a playgoer, being"
20028,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad
20029,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",filling-up of the inferior parts. While preparing for our departure
20030,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","from England, however, he saw Miss O'Neil several times. She was then"
20031,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",in the zenith of her glory; and Shelley was deeply moved by her
20032,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","impersonation of several parts, and by the graceful sweetness, the"
20033,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","intense pathos, the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed. She"
20034,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","was often in his thoughts as he wrote: and, when he had finished, he"
20035,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","became anxious that his tragedy should be acted, and receive the"
20036,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the
20037,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",heroine. With this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in
20038,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",London:
20039,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20040,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",'The object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you. I have
20041,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","written a tragedy on a story well known in Italy, and, in my"
20042,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","conception, eminently dramatic. I have taken some pains to make my"
20043,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","play fit for representation, and those who have already seen it judge"
20044,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",favourably. It is written without any of the peculiar feelings and
20045,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",opinions which characterize my other compositions; I have attended
20046,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is
20047,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","probable the persons represented really were, together with the"

20049,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",development. I send you a translation of the Italian manuscript on
20050,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",which my play is founded; the chief circumstance of which I have
20051,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",touched very delicately; for my principal doubt as to whether it would
20052,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether
20053,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","any such a thing as incest in this shape, however treated, would be"
20054,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","admitted on the stage. I think, however, it will form no objection;"
20055,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","considering, first, that the facts are matter of history, and,"
20056,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","secondly, the peculiar delicacy with which I have treated it. (In"
20057,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","speaking of his mode of treating this main incident, Shelley said that"
20058,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","it might be remarked that, in the course of the play, he had never"
20059,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",mentioned expressly Cenci's worst crime. Every one knew what it must
20060,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","be, but it was never imaged in words--the nearest allusion to it being"
20061,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",that portion of Cenci's curse beginning--
20062,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20063,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","""That, if she have a child,"" etc.)"
20064,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20065,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",'I am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt
20066,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",of mine will succeed or not. I am strongly inclined to the affirmative
20067,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","at present; founding my hopes on this--that, as a composition, it is"
20068,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been
20069,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","acted, with the exception of ""Remorse""; that the interest of the plot"
20070,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",is incredibly greater and more real; and that there is nothing beyond

20074,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","you will at least favour me on this point. Indeed, this is essential,"
20075,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","deeply essential, to its success. After it had been acted, and"
20076,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","successfully (could I hope for such a thing), I would own it if I"
20077,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","pleased, and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes."

20084,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",chief male character I confess I should be very unwilling that any one

20087,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20088,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",The play was accordingly sent to Mr. Harris. He pronounced the subject
20089,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to Miss
20090,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","O'Neil for perusal, but expressed his desire that the author would"
20091,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","write a tragedy on some other subject, which he would gladly accept."
20092,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Shelley printed a small edition at Leghorn, to ensure its correctness;"
20093,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text
20094,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",when distance prevented him from correcting the press.
20095,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
20096,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Universal approbation soon stamped ""The Cenci"" as the best tragedy of"
20097,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","modern times. Writing concerning it, Shelley said: 'I have been"
20098,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition;
20099,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","diffuseness, a profusion of inapplicable imagery, vagueness,"
20100,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","generality, and, as Hamlet says, ""words, words"".' There is nothing"
20101,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","that is not purely dramatic throughout; and the character of Beatrice,"
20102,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","proceeding, from vehement struggle, to horror, to deadly resolution,"
20103,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering, joined to"
20104,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","passionate tenderness and pathos, is touched with hues so vivid and so"
20105,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of
20106,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate
20107,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",girl. The Fifth Act is a masterpiece. It is the finest thing he ever
20108,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","wrote, and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary,"
20109,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","but preceding, poet. The varying feelings of Beatrice are expressed"
20110,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","with passionate, heart-reaching eloquence. Every character has a voice"
20111,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","that echoes truth in its tones. It is curious, to one acquainted with"
20112,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the written story, to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven"
20113,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes, and yet, through"
20114,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the power of poetry, has obliterated all that would otherwise have"
20115,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture. His success was a
20116,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",double triumph; and often after he was earnestly entreated to write
20117,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","again in a style that commanded popular favour, while it was not less"
20118,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",instinct with truth and genius. But the bent of his mind went the
20119,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","other way; and, even when employed on subjects whose interest depended"
20120,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","on character and incident, he would start off in another direction,"
20121,"NOTE ON THE CENCI, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","and leave the delineations of human passion, which he could depict in"

21705,DAMNATION.,All these Reviews the Devil made
21706,DAMNATION.,"Up in a parcel, which he had"

21730,DAMNATION.,"Like a crazed bell-chime, out of tune?'"
21731,DAMNATION.,
21732,DAMNATION.,11.
21733,DAMNATION.,"For Peter did not know the town,"

21740,DAMNATION.,All Peter did on this occasion
21741,DAMNATION.,"Was, writing some sad stuff in prose."
21742,DAMNATION.,It is a dangerous invasion                                           _515
21743,DAMNATION.,When poets criticize; their station
21744,DAMNATION.,"Is to delight, not pose."
21745,DAMNATION.,
21746,DAMNATION.,13.
21747,DAMNATION.,The Devil then sent to Leipsic fair
21748,DAMNATION.,For Born's translation of Kant's book;
21749,DAMNATION.,"A world of words, tail foremost, where                               _520"
21750,DAMNATION.,Right--wrong--false--true--and foul--and fair

21759,DAMNATION.,
21760,DAMNATION.,15.
21761,DAMNATION.,"I looked on them nine several days,"
21762,DAMNATION.,And then I saw that they were bad;
21763,DAMNATION.,"A friend, too, spoke in their dispraise,--                           _530"
21764,DAMNATION.,He never read them;--with amaze
21765,DAMNATION.,I found Sir William Drummond had.
21766,DAMNATION.,
21767,DAMNATION.,16.
21768,DAMNATION.,"When the book came, the Devil sent"
21769,DAMNATION.,"It to P. Verbovale (2), Esquire,"
21770,DAMNATION.,"With a brief note of compliment,                                     _535"
21771,DAMNATION.,"By that night's Carlisle mail. It went,"
21772,DAMNATION.,And set his soul on fire.
21773,DAMNATION.,
21774,DAMNATION.,17.
21775,DAMNATION.,"Fire, which ex luce praebens fumum,"
21776,DAMNATION.,Made him beyond the bottom see
21777,DAMNATION.,"Of truth's clear well--when I and you, Ma'am,                        _540"
21778,DAMNATION.,"Go, as we shall do, subter humum,"
21779,DAMNATION.,We may know more than he.
21780,DAMNATION.,
21781,DAMNATION.,18.
21782,DAMNATION.,Now Peter ran to seed in soul
21783,DAMNATION.,Into a walking paradox;
21784,DAMNATION.,"For he was neither part nor whole,                                   _545"
21785,DAMNATION.,"Nor good, nor bad--nor knave nor fool;"
21786,DAMNATION.,--Among the woods and rocks
21787,DAMNATION.,
21788,DAMNATION.,19.
21789,DAMNATION.,"Furious he rode, where late he ran,"
21790,DAMNATION.,Lashing and spurring his tame hobby;
21791,DAMNATION.,"Turned to a formal puritan,                                          _550"
21792,DAMNATION.,"A solemn and unsexual man,--"
21793,DAMNATION.,"He half believed ""White Obi""."
21794,DAMNATION.,
21795,DAMNATION.,20.
21796,DAMNATION.,"This steed in vision he would ride,"
21797,DAMNATION.,"High trotting over nine-inch bridges,"
21798,DAMNATION.,"With Flibbertigibbet, imp of pride,                                  _555"
21799,DAMNATION.,Mocking and mowing by his side--
21800,DAMNATION.,A mad-brained goblin for a guide--
21801,DAMNATION.,"Over corn-fields, gates, and hedges."
21802,DAMNATION.,
21803,DAMNATION.,21.
21804,DAMNATION.,"After these ghastly rides, he came"
21805,DAMNATION.,"Home to his heart, and found from thence                             _560"
21806,DAMNATION.,Much stolen of its accustomed flame;
21807,DAMNATION.,"His thoughts grew weak, drowsy, and lame"
21808,DAMNATION.,Of their intelligence.
21809,DAMNATION.,
21810,DAMNATION.,22.
21811,DAMNATION.,"To Peter's view, all seemed one hue;"
21812,DAMNATION.,"He was no Whig, he was no Tory;                                      _565"
21813,DAMNATION.,No Deist and no Christian he;--
21814,DAMNATION.,"He got so subtle, that to be"
21815,DAMNATION.,"Nothing, was all his glory."
21816,DAMNATION.,
21817,DAMNATION.,23.
21818,DAMNATION.,One single point in his belief
21819,DAMNATION.,"From his organization sprung,                                        _570"
21820,DAMNATION.,"The heart-enrooted faith, the chief"
21821,DAMNATION.,"Ear in his doctrines' blighted sheaf,"
21822,DAMNATION.,That 'Happiness is wrong';
21823,DAMNATION.,
21824,DAMNATION.,24.
21825,DAMNATION.,So thought Calvin and Dominic;
21826,DAMNATION.,"So think their fierce successors, who                                _575"
21827,DAMNATION.,Even now would neither stint nor stick
21828,DAMNATION.,"Our flesh from off our bones to pick,"
21829,DAMNATION.,If they might 'do their do.'
21830,DAMNATION.,
21831,DAMNATION.,25.
21832,DAMNATION.,His morals thus were undermined:--
21833,DAMNATION.,"The old Peter--the hard, old Potter--                                _580"
21834,DAMNATION.,Was born anew within his mind;
21835,DAMNATION.,"He grew dull, harsh, sly, unrefined,"
21836,DAMNATION.,As when he tramped beside the Otter. (1)
21837,DAMNATION.,
21838,DAMNATION.,26.
21839,DAMNATION.,In the death hues of agony
21840,DAMNATION.,"Lambently flashing from a fish,                                      _585"
21841,DAMNATION.,Now Peter felt amused to see
21842,DAMNATION.,"Shades like a rainbow's rise and flee,"
21843,DAMNATION.,Mixed with a certain hungry wish(2).
21844,DAMNATION.,
21845,DAMNATION.,27.
21846,DAMNATION.,So in his Country's dying face
21847,DAMNATION.,"He looked--and, lovely as she lay,                                   _590"
21848,DAMNATION.,"Seeking in vain his last embrace,"
21849,DAMNATION.,"Wailing her own abandoned case,"
21850,DAMNATION.,With hardened sneer he turned away:
21851,DAMNATION.,
21852,DAMNATION.,28.
21853,DAMNATION.,And coolly to his own soul said;--
21854,DAMNATION.,'Do you not think that we might make                                 _595
21855,DAMNATION.,A poem on her when she's dead:--
21856,DAMNATION.,"Or, no--a thought is in my head--"
21857,DAMNATION.,Her shroud for a new sheet I'll take:
21858,DAMNATION.,
21859,DAMNATION.,29.
21860,DAMNATION.,'My wife wants one.--Let who will bury

21862,DAMNATION.,"My dearest Soul, will then make merry,"
21863,DAMNATION.,"As the Prince Regent did with Sherry,--'"
21864,DAMNATION.,'Ay--and at last desert me too.'
21865,DAMNATION.,
21866,DAMNATION.,30.
21867,DAMNATION.,"And so his Soul would not be gay,"
21868,DAMNATION.,But moaned within him; like a fawn                                   _605
21869,DAMNATION.,"Moaning within a cave, it lay"
21870,DAMNATION.,"Wounded and wasting, day by day,"
21871,DAMNATION.,Till all its life of life was gone.
21872,DAMNATION.,
21873,DAMNATION.,31.
21874,DAMNATION.,"As troubled skies stain waters clear,"
21875,DAMNATION.,The storm in Peter's heart and mind                                  _610
21876,DAMNATION.,Now made his verses dark and queer:
21877,DAMNATION.,"They were the ghosts of what they were,"
21878,DAMNATION.,Shaking dim grave-clothes in the wind.
21879,DAMNATION.,
21880,DAMNATION.,32.
21881,DAMNATION.,"For he now raved enormous folly,"
21882,DAMNATION.,"Of Baptisms, Sunday-schools, and Graves,                             _615"
21883,DAMNATION.,'Twould make George Colman melancholy
21884,DAMNATION.,"To have heard him, like a male Molly,"
21885,DAMNATION.,Chanting those stupid staves.
21886,DAMNATION.,
21887,DAMNATION.,33.
21888,DAMNATION.,"Yet the Reviews, who heaped abuse"
21889,DAMNATION.,"On Peter while he wrote for freedom,                                 _620"
21890,DAMNATION.,So soon as in his song they spy
21891,DAMNATION.,"The folly which soothes tyranny,"
21892,DAMNATION.,"Praise him, for those who feed 'em."
21893,DAMNATION.,
21894,DAMNATION.,34.
21895,DAMNATION.,"'He was a man, too great to scan;--"
21896,DAMNATION.,A planet lost in truth's keen rays:--                                _625
21897,DAMNATION.,"His virtue, awful and prodigious;--"
21898,DAMNATION.,"He was the most sublime, religious,"
21899,DAMNATION.,Pure-minded Poet of these days.'
21900,DAMNATION.,
21901,DAMNATION.,35.
21902,DAMNATION.,"As soon as he read that, cried Peter,"
21903,DAMNATION.,'Eureka! I have found the way                                        _630
21904,DAMNATION.,To make a better thing of metre
21905,DAMNATION.,Than e'er was made by living creature
21906,DAMNATION.,Up to this blessed day.'
21907,DAMNATION.,
21908,DAMNATION.,36.
21909,DAMNATION.,Then Peter wrote odes to the Devil;--
21910,DAMNATION.,In one of which he meekly said:                                      _635
21911,DAMNATION.,"'May Carnage and Slaughter,"
21912,DAMNATION.,"Thy niece and thy daughter,"
21913,DAMNATION.,"May Rapine and Famine,"
21914,DAMNATION.,"Thy gorge ever cramming,"
21915,DAMNATION.,Glut thee with living and dead!                                      _640
21916,DAMNATION.,

21920,DAMNATION.,Flit up from Hell with pure intent!
21921,DAMNATION.,"Slash them at Manchester,"

21925,DAMNATION.,38.
21926,DAMNATION.,'Let thy body-guard yeomen

21928,DAMNATION.,And laugh with bold triumph till Heaven be rent!
21929,DAMNATION.,When Moloch in Jewry                                                 _650

21967,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"These words exchanged, the news sent off"

21972,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
21973,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,6.
21974,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,The Devil's corpse was leaded down;

21979,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,
21980,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,7.
21981,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"When Peter heard of his promotion,"

21984,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,Engendering in his back; each motion

21988,DOUBLE DAMNATION.,"He hired a house, bought plate, and made"

23173,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
23174,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,49.
23175,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,A haven beneath whose translucent floor

23213,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
23214,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,53.
23215,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen                   _465

23233,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
23234,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,55.
23235,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,These were tame pleasures; she would often climb
23236,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,The steepest ladder of the crudded rack
23237,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,"
23238,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And like Arion on the dolphin's back

23243,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
23244,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,56.
23245,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,And sometimes to those streams of upper air

23313,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,
23314,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,63.

23329,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,For all were educated to be so.--
23330,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The peasants in their huts, and in the port"
23331,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,"

23334,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,65.

23350,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"And then she had a charm of strange device,"
23351,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,"Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                       _575"
23352,THE WITCH OF ATLAS.,Could make that spirit mingle with her own.

23499,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","We spent the summer of 1820 at the Baths of San Giuliano, four miles"
23500,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",from Pisa. These baths were of great use to Shelley in soothing his
23501,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",nervous irritability. We made several excursions in the neighbourhood.
23502,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","The country around is fertile, and diversified and rendered"
23503,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains. The
23504,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",peasantry are a handsome intelligent race; and there was a gladsome
23505,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","sunny heaven spread over us, that rendered home and every scene we"
23506,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",visited cheerful and bright. During some of the hottest days of
23507,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","August, Shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of Monte"
23508,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","San Pellegrino--a mountain of some height, on the top of which there"
23509,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","is a chapel, the object, during certain days of the year, of many"
23510,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",pilgrimages. The excursion delighted him while it lasted; though he
23511,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","exerted himself too much, and the effect was considerable lassitude"
23512,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",and weakness on his return. During the expedition he conceived the
23513,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","idea, and wrote, in the three days immediately succeeding to his"
23514,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","return, the ""Witch of Atlas"". This poem is peculiarly characteristic"
23515,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","of his tastes--wildly fanciful, full of brilliant imagery, and"
23516,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","discarding human interest and passion, to revel in the fantastic ideas"
23517,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",that his imagination suggested.
23518,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
23519,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","The surpassing excellence of ""The Cenci"" had made me greatly desire"
23520,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",that Shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that
23521,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the
23522,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","abstract and dreamy spirit of the ""Witch of Atlas"". It was not only"
23523,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",that I wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame; but
23524,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","I believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers,"
23525,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","and greater happiness in his mind, if public applause crowned his"
23526,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",endeavours. The few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me
23527,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",on my representing these ideas to him. Even now I believe that I was
23528,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",in the right. Shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the
23529,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",public; but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that
23530,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",ought to have sustained him while writing. He was thrown on his own
23531,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","resources, and on the inspiration of his own soul; and wrote because"
23532,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","his mind overflowed, without the hope of being appreciated. I had not"
23533,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion, or submit his"
23534,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of
23535,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the many; but I felt sure that, if his poems were more addressed to"
23536,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the common feelings of men, his proper rank among the writers of the"
23537,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","day would be acknowledged, and that popularity as a poet would enable"
23538,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues, which in"
23539,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious
23540,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",calumnies and insulting abuse. That he felt these things deeply cannot
23541,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","be doubted, though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting"
23542,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",from a lofty and heroic sense of right. The truth burst from his heart
23543,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","sometimes in solitude, and he would writes few unfinished verses that"
23544,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",showed that he felt the sting; among such I find the following:--
23545,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
23546,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",'Alas! this is not what I thought Life was.
23547,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","I knew that there were crimes and evil men,"
23548,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Misery and hate; nor did I hope to pass
23549,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Untouched by suffering through the rugged glen.
23550,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",In mine own heart I saw as in a glass
23551,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","The hearts of others...And, when"
23552,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","I went among my kind, with triple brass"
23553,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Of calm endurance my weak breast I armed,"
23554,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","To bear scorn, fear, and hate--a woful mass!'"
23555,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
23556,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",I believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of
23557,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched. But my
23558,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","persuasions were vain, the mind could not be bent from its natural"
23559,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",inclination. Shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human
23560,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","passion, with its mixture of good and evil, of disappointment and"
23561,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",disquiet. Such opened again the wounds of his own heart; and he loved
23562,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy, forgetting"
23563,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","love and hate, and regret and lost hope, in such imaginations as"

23568,"NOTE ON THE WITCH OF ATLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",which Nature creates in her solitudes. These are the materials which

24943,ADVERTISEMENT.,"preparing for a voyage to one of the wildest of the Sporades, which he"
24944,ADVERTISEMENT.,"had bought, and where he had fitted up the ruins of an old building,"
24945,ADVERTISEMENT.,"and where it was his hope to have realised a scheme of life, suited"
24946,ADVERTISEMENT.,perhaps to that happier and better world of which he is now an
24947,ADVERTISEMENT.,"inhabitant, but hardly practicable in this. His life was singular;"
24948,ADVERTISEMENT.,"less on account of the romantic vicissitudes which diversified it,"
24949,ADVERTISEMENT.,than the ideal tinge which it received from his own character and
24950,ADVERTISEMENT.,"feelings. The present Poem, like the ""Vita Nuova"" of Dante, is"
24951,ADVERTISEMENT.,sufficiently intelligible to a certain class of readers without a
24952,ADVERTISEMENT.,matter-of-fact history of the circumstances to which it relates and to
24953,ADVERTISEMENT.,"a certain other class it must ever remain incomprehensible, from a"

25182,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"By which those live, to whom this world of life"
25183,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Is as a garden ravaged, and whose strife"
25184,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Tills for the promise of a later birth
25185,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The wilderness of this Elysian earth.
25186,EPIPSYCHIDION.,
25187,EPIPSYCHIDION.,There was a Being whom my spirit oft                                 _190
25188,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,"
25189,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"In the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn,"
25190,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,"
25191,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves"
25192,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves                           _195"
25193,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor"
25194,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Paved her light steps;--on an imagined shore,"
25195,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Under the gray beak of some promontory
25196,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,"
25197,EPIPSYCHIDION.,That I beheld her not. In solitudes                                  _200
25198,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Her voice came to me through the whispering woods,"
25199,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And from the fountains, and the odours deep"
25200,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Of flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep"
25201,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,"
25202,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Breathed but of HER to the enamoured air;                            _205
25203,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And from the breezes whether low or loud,"
25204,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And from the rain of every passing cloud,"
25205,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And from the singing of the summer-birds,"
25206,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And from all sounds, all silence. In the words"
25207,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Of antique verse and high romance,--in form,                         _210"
25208,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Sound, colour--in whatever checks that Storm"
25209,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Which with the shattered present chokes the past;
25210,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And in that best philosophy, whose taste"
25211,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Makes this cold common hell, our life, a doom"
25212,EPIPSYCHIDION.,As glorious as a fiery martyrdom;                                    _215
25213,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Her Spirit was the harmony of truth.--
25214,EPIPSYCHIDION.,
25215,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Then, from the caverns of my dreamy youth"
25216,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"I sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,"
25217,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And towards the lodestar of my one desire,"
25218,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"I flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight                           _220"
25219,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light,"
25220,EPIPSYCHIDION.,When it would seek in Hesper's setting sphere
25221,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"A radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,"
25222,EPIPSYCHIDION.,As if it were a lamp of earthly flame.--
25223,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"But She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,                  _225"
25224,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Passed, like a God throned on a winged planet,"
25225,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,"
25226,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Into the dreary cone of our life's shade;
25227,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And as a man with mighty loss dismayed,"
25228,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"I would have followed, though the grave between                      _230"
25229,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen:
25230,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"When a voice said:--'O thou of hearts the weakest,"
25231,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.'
25232,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Then I--'Where?'--the world's echo answered 'where?'
25233,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And in that silence, and in my despair,                              _235"
25234,EPIPSYCHIDION.,I questioned every tongueless wind that flew
25235,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Over my tower of mourning, if it knew"
25236,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Whither 'twas fled, this soul out of my soul;"
25237,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And murmured names and spells which have control
25238,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Over the sightless tyrants of our fate;                              _240
25239,EPIPSYCHIDION.,But neither prayer nor verse could dissipate
25240,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The night which closed on her; nor uncreate
25241,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"That world within this Chaos, mine and me,"
25242,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Of which she was the veiled Divinity,"
25243,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The world I say of thoughts that worshipped her:                     _245
25244,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And therefore I went forth, with hope and fear"
25245,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And every gentle passion sick to death,"
25246,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Feeding my course with expectation's breath,"
25247,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Into the wintry forest of our life;
25248,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And struggling through its error with vain strife,                   _250"
25249,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And stumbling in my weakness and my haste,"
25250,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And half bewildered by new forms, I passed,"
25251,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Seeking among those untaught foresters
25252,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"If I could find one form resembling hers,"
25253,EPIPSYCHIDION.,In which she might have masked herself from me.                      _255
25254,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"There,--One, whose voice was venomed melody"
25255,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Sate by a well, under blue nightshade bowers:"
25256,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,"
25257,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Her touch was as electric poison,--flame"
25258,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Out of her looks into my vitals came,                                _260"
25259,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And from her living cheeks and bosom flew
25260,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"A killing air, which pierced like honey-dew"
25261,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Into the core of my green heart, and lay"
25262,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Upon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray"
25263,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"O'er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime                        _265"
25264,EPIPSYCHIDION.,With ruins of unseasonable time.
25265,EPIPSYCHIDION.,
25266,EPIPSYCHIDION.,In many mortal forms I rashly sought
25267,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The shadow of that idol of my thought.
25268,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And some were fair--but beauty dies away:
25269,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Others were wise--but honeyed words betray:                          _270
25270,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And One was true--oh! why not true to me?
25271,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Then, as a hunted deer that could not flee,"
25272,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"I turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,"
25273,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Wounded and weak and panting; the cold day
25274,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Trembled, for pity of my strife and pain.                            _275"
25275,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"When, like a noonday dawn, there shone again"
25276,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Deliverance. One stood on my path who seemed
25277,EPIPSYCHIDION.,As like the glorious shape which I had d reamed
25278,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"As is the Moon, whose changes ever run"
25279,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Into themselves, to the eternal Sun;                                 _280"
25280,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven's bright isles,"
25281,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Who makes all beautiful on which she smiles,"
25282,EPIPSYCHIDION.,That wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame
25283,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,"
25284,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And warms not but illumines. Young and fair                          _285
25285,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"As the descended Spirit of that sphere,"
25286,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"She hid me, as the Moon may hide the night"
25287,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"From its own darkness, until all was bright"
25288,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Between the Heaven and Earth of my calm mind,"
25289,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And, as a cloud charioted by the wind,                               _290"
25290,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"She led me to a cave in that wild place,"
25291,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And sate beside me, with her downward face"
25292,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Illumining my slumbers, like the Moon"
25293,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Waxing and waning o'er Endymion.
25294,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,                              _295"
25295,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And all my being became bright or dim
25296,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"As the Moon's image in a summer sea,"
25297,EPIPSYCHIDION.,According as she smiled or frowned on me;
25298,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And there I lay, within a chaste cold bed:"
25299,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Alas, I then was nor alive nor dead:--                               _300"
25300,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"For at her silver voice came Death and Life,"
25301,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Unmindful each of their accustomed strife,"
25302,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Masked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,"
25303,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,"
25304,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And through the cavern without wings they flew,                      _305"
25305,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And cried 'Away, he is not of our crew.'"
25306,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"I wept, and though it be a dream, I weep."
25307,EPIPSYCHIDION.,
25308,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"What storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,"
25309,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Blotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips"
25310,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;--                         _310
25311,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And how my soul was as a lampless sea,"
25312,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And who was then its Tempest; and when She,"
25313,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost"
25314,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Crept o'er those waters, till from coast to coast"
25315,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The moving billows of my being fell                                  _315
25316,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Into a death of ice, immovable;--"
25317,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And then--what earthquakes made it gape and split,"
25318,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The white Moon smiling all the while on it,"
25319,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"These words conceal:--If not, each word would be"
25320,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The key of staunchless tears. Weep not for me!                       _320
25321,EPIPSYCHIDION.,
25322,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"At length, into the obscure Forest came"
25323,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The Vision I had sought through grief and shame.
25324,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns
25325,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Flashed from her motion splendour like the Morn's,"
25326,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And from her presence life was radiated                              _325
25327,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Through the gray earth and branches bare and dead;
25328,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"So that her way was paved, and roofed above"
25329,EPIPSYCHIDION.,With flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love;
25330,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And music from her respiration spread
25331,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Like light,--all other sounds were penetrated                        _330"
25332,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"By the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,"
25333,EPIPSYCHIDION.,So that the savage winds hung mute around;
25334,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And odours warm and fresh fell from her hair
25335,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Dissolving the dull cold in the frore air:
25336,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Soft as an Incarnation of the Sun,                                   _335"
25337,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"When light is changed to love, this glorious One"
25338,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Floated into the cavern where I lay,"
25339,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And called my Spirit, and the dreaming clay"
25340,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Was lifted by the thing that dreamed below
25341,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"As smoke by fire, and in her beauty's glow                           _340"
25342,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"I stood, and felt the dawn of my long night"
25343,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Was penetrating me with living light:
25344,EPIPSYCHIDION.,I knew it was the Vision veiled from me
25345,EPIPSYCHIDION.,So many years--that it was Emily.
25346,EPIPSYCHIDION.,
25347,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Twin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,                   _345"
25348,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"This world of loves, this ME; and into birth"
25349,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Awaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart"
25350,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Magnetic might into its central heart;
25351,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And lift its billows and its mists, and guide"
25352,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"By everlasting laws, each wind and tide                              _350"
25353,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"To its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;"
25354,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And lull its storms, each in the craggy grave"
25355,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Which was its cradle, luring to faint bowers"
25356,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The armies of the rainbow-winged showers;
25357,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And, as those married lights, which from the towers                  _355"
25358,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Of Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe
25359,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"In liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;"
25360,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And all their many-mingled influence blend,"
25361,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"If equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;--"
25362,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"So ye, bright regents, with alternate sway                           _360"
25363,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Govern my sphere of being, night and day!"
25364,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Thou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;"
25365,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Thou, not eclipsing a remoter light;"
25366,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"And, through the shadow of the seasons three,"
25367,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"From Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,                               _365"
25368,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Light it into the Winter of the tomb,"
25369,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Where it may ripen to a brighter bloom.
25370,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Thou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,"
25371,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Who drew the heart of this frail Universe
25372,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Towards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,                 _370"
25373,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Alternating attraction and repulsion,"
25374,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Thine went astray and that was rent in twain;
25375,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Oh, float into our azure heaven again!"
25376,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Be there Love's folding-star at thy return;
25377,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The living Sun will feed thee from its urn                           _375
25378,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Of golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn
25379,EPIPSYCHIDION.,In thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn
25380,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Will worship thee with incense of calm breath
25381,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And lights and shadows; as the star of Death
25382,EPIPSYCHIDION.,And Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild                        _380
25383,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Called Hope and Fear--upon the heart are piled
25384,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Their offerings,--of this sacrifice divine"
25385,EPIPSYCHIDION.,A World shall be the altar.
25386,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Lady mine,"
25387,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Scorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth"
25388,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth                 _385
25389,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Whose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,"
25390,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Will be as of the trees of Paradise.

25400,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set"
25401,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The sentinels--but true Love never yet

25403,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Like lightning, with invisible violence"
25404,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Piercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,                  _400"
25405,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Which he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,"
25406,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Who rides upon a thought, and makes his way"
25407,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Through temple, tower, and palace, and the array"
25408,EPIPSYCHIDION.,Of arms: more strength has Love than he or they;
25409,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"For it can burst his charnel, and make free                          _405"
25410,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"The limbs in chains, the heart in agony,"
25411,EPIPSYCHIDION.,The soul in dust and chaos.
25412,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"Emily,"
25413,EPIPSYCHIDION.,"A ship is floating in the harbour now,"

25440,EPIPSYCHIDION.,There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;                      _435

26235,ADONAIS.,To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear                                  _140
26236,ADONAIS.,"Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both"
26237,ADONAIS.,"Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere"
26238,ADONAIS.,"Amid the faint companions of their youth,"
26239,ADONAIS.,"With dew all turned to tears; odour, to sighing ruth."
26240,ADONAIS.,
26241,ADONAIS.,17.
26242,ADONAIS.,"Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale                            _145"
26243,ADONAIS.,Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain;
26244,ADONAIS.,"Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale"
26245,ADONAIS.,"Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain"
26246,ADONAIS.,"Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain,"
26247,ADONAIS.,"Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,                          _150"
26248,ADONAIS.,As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain
26249,ADONAIS.,"Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast,"
26250,ADONAIS.,And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest!
26251,ADONAIS.,
26252,ADONAIS.,18.
26253,ADONAIS.,"Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,"
26254,ADONAIS.,But grief returns with the revolving year;                           _155
26255,ADONAIS.,The airs and streams renew their joyous tone;
26256,ADONAIS.,"The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;"
26257,ADONAIS.,Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier;
26258,ADONAIS.,"The amorous birds now pair in every brake,"
26259,ADONAIS.,And build their mossy homes in field and brere;                      _160
26260,ADONAIS.,"And the green lizard, and the golden snake,"
26261,ADONAIS.,"Like unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake."
26262,ADONAIS.,
26263,ADONAIS.,19.
26264,ADONAIS.,Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean
26265,ADONAIS.,A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst
26266,ADONAIS.,"As it has ever done, with change and motion,                         _165"
26267,ADONAIS.,From the great morning of the world when first
26268,ADONAIS.,"God dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,"
26269,ADONAIS.,The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;
26270,ADONAIS.,All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;
26271,ADONAIS.,"Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight,                     _170"
26272,ADONAIS.,The beauty and the joy of their renewed might.
26273,ADONAIS.,
26274,ADONAIS.,20.
26275,ADONAIS.,"The leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,"
26276,ADONAIS.,Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;
26277,ADONAIS.,"Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour"
26278,ADONAIS.,"Is changed to fragrance, they illumine death                         _175"
26279,ADONAIS.,And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;
26280,ADONAIS.,"Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows"
26281,ADONAIS.,Be as a sword consumed before the sheath
26282,ADONAIS.,By sightless lightning?--the intense atom glows
26283,ADONAIS.,"A moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.                    _180"
26284,ADONAIS.,
26285,ADONAIS.,21.
26286,ADONAIS.,"Alas! that all we loved of him should be,"
26287,ADONAIS.,"But for our grief, as if it had not been,"
26288,ADONAIS.,And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!
26289,ADONAIS.,"Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene"
26290,ADONAIS.,The actors or spectators? Great and mean                             _185
26291,ADONAIS.,"Meet massed in death, who lends what life must borrow."
26292,ADONAIS.,"As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,"
26293,ADONAIS.,"Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,"
26294,ADONAIS.,"Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow."
26295,ADONAIS.,
26296,ADONAIS.,22.
26297,ADONAIS.,"HE will awake no more, oh, never more!                               _190"
26298,ADONAIS.,"'Wake thou,' cried Misery, 'childless Mother, rise"
26299,ADONAIS.,"Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core,"
26300,ADONAIS.,"A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs.'"
26301,ADONAIS.,"And all the Dreams that watched Urania's eyes,"
26302,ADONAIS.,And all the Echoes whom their sister's song                          _195
26303,ADONAIS.,"Had held in holy silence, cried: 'Arise!'"
26304,ADONAIS.,"Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,"
26305,ADONAIS.,From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.
26306,ADONAIS.,
26307,ADONAIS.,23.
26308,ADONAIS.,"She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs"
26309,ADONAIS.,"Out of the East, and follows wild and drear                          _200"
26310,ADONAIS.,"The golden Day, which, on eternal wings,"
26311,ADONAIS.,"Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,"
26312,ADONAIS.,Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear
26313,ADONAIS.,"So struck, so roused, so rapped Urania;"
26314,ADONAIS.,So saddened round her like an atmosphere                             _205
26315,ADONAIS.,Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way
26316,ADONAIS.,Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay.
26317,ADONAIS.,
26318,ADONAIS.,24.
26319,ADONAIS.,"Out of her secret Paradise she sped,"
26320,ADONAIS.,"Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,"
26321,ADONAIS.,"And human hearts, which to her aery tread                            _210"
26322,ADONAIS.,"Yielding not, wounded the invisible"
26323,ADONAIS.,Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell:
26324,ADONAIS.,"And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they,"
26325,ADONAIS.,"Rent the soft Form they never could repel,"
26326,ADONAIS.,"Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,                     _215"
26327,ADONAIS.,Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way.
26328,ADONAIS.,
26329,ADONAIS.,25.
26330,ADONAIS.,"In the death-chamber for a moment Death,"
26331,ADONAIS.,"Shamed by the presence of that living Might,"
26332,ADONAIS.,"Blushed to annihilation, and the breath"
26333,ADONAIS.,"Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light                          _220"
26334,ADONAIS.,"Flashed through those limbs, so late her dear delight."
26335,ADONAIS.,"'Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,"
26336,ADONAIS.,As silent lightning leaves the starless night!
26337,ADONAIS.,Leave me not!' cried Urania: her distress
26338,ADONAIS.,"Roused Death: Death rose and smiled, and met her vain caress.        _225"
26339,ADONAIS.,
26340,ADONAIS.,26.
26341,ADONAIS.,'Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;
26342,ADONAIS.,"Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;"
26343,ADONAIS.,And in my heartless breast and burning brain
26344,ADONAIS.,"That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,"
26345,ADONAIS.,"With food of saddest memory kept alive,                              _230"
26346,ADONAIS.,"Now thou art dead, as if it were a part"
26347,ADONAIS.,"Of thee, my Adonais! I would give"
26348,ADONAIS.,All that I am to be as thou now art!
26349,ADONAIS.,"But I am chained to Time, and cannot thence depart!"
26350,ADONAIS.,
26351,ADONAIS.,27.
26352,ADONAIS.,"'O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert,                             _235"
26353,ADONAIS.,Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men
26354,ADONAIS.,"Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart"
26355,ADONAIS.,Dare the unpastured dragon in his den?
26356,ADONAIS.,"Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then"
26357,ADONAIS.,"Wisdom the mirrored shield, or scorn the spear?                      _240"
26358,ADONAIS.,"Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when"
26359,ADONAIS.,"Thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere,"
26360,ADONAIS.,The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer.
26361,ADONAIS.,
26362,ADONAIS.,28.
26363,ADONAIS.,"'The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;"
26364,ADONAIS.,"The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;                         _245"
26365,ADONAIS.,The vultures to the conqueror's banner true
26366,ADONAIS.,"Who feed where Desolation first has fed,"
26367,ADONAIS.,"And whose wings rain contagion;--how they fled,"
26368,ADONAIS.,"When, like Apollo, from his golden bow"
26369,ADONAIS.,The Pythian of the age one arrow sped                                _250
26370,ADONAIS.,"And smiled!--The spoilers tempt no second blow,"
26371,ADONAIS.,They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low.
26372,ADONAIS.,
26373,ADONAIS.,29.
26374,ADONAIS.,"'The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn;"
26375,ADONAIS.,"He sets, and each ephemeral insect then"
26376,ADONAIS.,"Is gathered into death without a dawn,                               _255"
26377,ADONAIS.,And the immortal stars awake again;
26378,ADONAIS.,So is it in the world of living men:
26379,ADONAIS.,"A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight"
26380,ADONAIS.,"Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when"
26381,ADONAIS.,"It sinks, the swarms that dimmed or shared its light                 _260"
26382,ADONAIS.,Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night.'
26383,ADONAIS.,
26384,ADONAIS.,30.
26385,ADONAIS.,"Thus ceased she: and the mountain shepherds came,"
26386,ADONAIS.,"Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent;"
26387,ADONAIS.,"The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame"
26388,ADONAIS.,"Over his living head like Heaven is bent,                            _265"
26389,ADONAIS.,"An early but enduring monument,"
26390,ADONAIS.,"Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song"
26391,ADONAIS.,In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent
26392,ADONAIS.,"The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong,"
26393,ADONAIS.,And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue.            _270
26394,ADONAIS.,
26395,ADONAIS.,31.
26396,ADONAIS.,"Midst others of less note, came one frail Form,"
26397,ADONAIS.,A phantom among men; companionless
26398,ADONAIS.,As the last cloud of an expiring storm
26399,ADONAIS.,"Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,"
26400,ADONAIS.,"Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,                              _275"
26401,ADONAIS.,"Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray"
26402,ADONAIS.,"With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,"
26403,ADONAIS.,"And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,"
26404,ADONAIS.,"Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey."
26405,ADONAIS.,
26406,ADONAIS.,32.
26407,ADONAIS.,A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift--                              _280
26408,ADONAIS.,A Love in desolation masked;--a Power
26409,ADONAIS.,Girt round with weakness;--it can scarce uplift
26410,ADONAIS.,The weight of the superincumbent hour;
26411,ADONAIS.,"It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,"
26412,ADONAIS.,A breaking billow;--even whilst we speak                             _285
26413,ADONAIS.,Is it not broken? On the withering flower
26414,ADONAIS.,The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek
26415,ADONAIS.,"The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break."
26416,ADONAIS.,
26417,ADONAIS.,33.
26418,ADONAIS.,"His head was bound with pansies overblown,"
26419,ADONAIS.,"And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;                        _290"
26420,ADONAIS.,"And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,"
26421,ADONAIS.,Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew
26422,ADONAIS.,"Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew,"
26423,ADONAIS.,"Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart"
26424,ADONAIS.,Shook the weak hand that grasped it; of that crew                    _295
26425,ADONAIS.,"He came the last, neglected and apart;"
26426,ADONAIS.,A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter's dart.
26427,ADONAIS.,
26428,ADONAIS.,34.
26429,ADONAIS.,"All stood aloof, and at his partial moan"
26430,ADONAIS.,Smiled through their tears; well knew that gentle band
26431,ADONAIS.,"Who in another's fate now wept his own,                              _300"
26432,ADONAIS.,As in the accents of an unknown land
26433,ADONAIS.,He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scanned
26434,ADONAIS.,"The Stranger's mien, and murmured: 'Who art thou?'"
26435,ADONAIS.,"He answered not, but with a sudden hand"
26436,ADONAIS.,"Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow,                          _305"
26437,ADONAIS.,Which was like Cain's or Christ's--oh! that it should be so!
26438,ADONAIS.,
26439,ADONAIS.,35.
26440,ADONAIS.,What softer voice is hushed over the dead?
26441,ADONAIS.,Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?
26442,ADONAIS.,"What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed,"
26443,ADONAIS.,"In mockery of monumental stone,                                      _310"
26444,ADONAIS.,The heavy heart heaving without a moan?
26445,ADONAIS.,"If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,"
26446,ADONAIS.,"Taught, soothed, loved, honoured the departed one,"
26447,ADONAIS.,"Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs,"
26448,ADONAIS.,The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice.                      _315
26449,ADONAIS.,
26450,ADONAIS.,36.
26451,ADONAIS.,Our Adonais has drunk poison--oh!
26452,ADONAIS.,What deaf and viperous murderer could crown
26453,ADONAIS.,Life's early cup with such a draught of woe?
26454,ADONAIS.,The nameless worm would now itself disown:
26455,ADONAIS.,"It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone                            _320"
26456,ADONAIS.,"Whose prelude held all envy, hate and wrong,"
26457,ADONAIS.,"But what was howling in one breast alone,"
26458,ADONAIS.,"Silent with expectation of the song,"
26459,ADONAIS.,"Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung."
26460,ADONAIS.,
26461,ADONAIS.,37.
26462,ADONAIS.,"Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!                             _325"
26463,ADONAIS.,"Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,"
26464,ADONAIS.,Thou noteless blot on a remembered name!
26465,ADONAIS.,"But be thyself, and know thyself to be!"
26466,ADONAIS.,And ever at thy season be thou free
26467,ADONAIS.,To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow;                          _330
26468,ADONAIS.,Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;
26469,ADONAIS.,"Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,"
26470,ADONAIS.,And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt--as now.
26471,ADONAIS.,
26472,ADONAIS.,38.
26473,ADONAIS.,Nor let us weep that our delight is fled
26474,ADONAIS.,Far from these carrion kites that scream below;                      _335
26475,ADONAIS.,He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;
26476,ADONAIS.,Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now--
26477,ADONAIS.,Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow
26478,ADONAIS.,"Back to the burning fountain whence it came,"
26479,ADONAIS.,"A portion of the Eternal, which must glow                            _340"
26480,ADONAIS.,"Through time and change, unquenchably the same,"
26481,ADONAIS.,Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame.
26482,ADONAIS.,
26483,ADONAIS.,39.
26484,ADONAIS.,"Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep--"
26485,ADONAIS.,He hath awakened from the dream of life--
26486,ADONAIS.,"'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep                            _345"
26487,ADONAIS.,"With phantoms an unprofitable strife,"
26488,ADONAIS.,"And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife"
26489,ADONAIS.,Invulnerable nothings.--WE decay
26490,ADONAIS.,Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief
26491,ADONAIS.,"Convulse us and consume us day by day,                               _350"
26492,ADONAIS.,And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.
26493,ADONAIS.,
26494,ADONAIS.,40.
26495,ADONAIS.,He has outsoared the shadow of our night;
26496,ADONAIS.,"Envy and calumny and hate and pain,"
26497,ADONAIS.,"And that unrest which men miscall delight,"
26498,ADONAIS.,Can touch him not and torture not again;                             _355
26499,ADONAIS.,From the contagion of the world's slow stain
26500,ADONAIS.,"He is secure, and now can never mourn"
26501,ADONAIS.,"A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain;"
26502,ADONAIS.,"Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn,"
26503,ADONAIS.,With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.                         _360
26504,ADONAIS.,
26505,ADONAIS.,41.
26506,ADONAIS.,"He lives, he wakes--'tis Death is dead, not he;"
26507,ADONAIS.,"Mourn not for Adonais.--Thou young Dawn,"
26508,ADONAIS.,"Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee"
26509,ADONAIS.,The spirit thou lamentest is not gone;
26510,ADONAIS.,"Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!                            _365"
26511,ADONAIS.,"Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air,"
26512,ADONAIS.,Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown
26513,ADONAIS.,"O'er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bare"
26514,ADONAIS.,Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!
26515,ADONAIS.,
26516,ADONAIS.,42.
26517,ADONAIS.,He is made one with Nature: there is heard                           _370
26518,ADONAIS.,"His voice in all her music, from the moan"
26519,ADONAIS.,"Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird;"
26520,ADONAIS.,He is a presence to be felt and known
26521,ADONAIS.,"In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,"
26522,ADONAIS.,Spreading itself where'er that Power may move                        _375
26523,ADONAIS.,Which has withdrawn his being to its own;
26524,ADONAIS.,"Which wields the world with never-wearied love,"
26525,ADONAIS.,"Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above."
26526,ADONAIS.,
26527,ADONAIS.,43.
26528,ADONAIS.,He is a portion of the loveliness
26529,ADONAIS.,Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear                         _380
26530,ADONAIS.,"His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress"
26531,ADONAIS.,"Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there"
26532,ADONAIS.,All new successions to the forms they wear;
26533,ADONAIS.,Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight
26534,ADONAIS.,"To its own likeness, as each mass may bear;                          _385"
26535,ADONAIS.,And bursting in its beauty and its might
26536,ADONAIS.,From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light.

26831,PREFACE.,
26832,PREFACE.,"The poem of ""Hellas"", written at the suggestion of the events of the"
26833,PREFACE.,"moment, is a mere improvise, and derives its interest (should it be"
26834,PREFACE.,found to possess any) solely from the intense sympathy which the
26835,PREFACE.,Author feels with the cause he would celebrate.
26836,PREFACE.,
26837,PREFACE.,"The subject, in its present state, is insusceptible of being treated"
26838,PREFACE.,"otherwise than lyrically, and if I have called this poem a drama from"
26839,PREFACE.,"the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue, the licence is not"
26840,PREFACE.,greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have
26841,PREFACE.,"called their productions epics, only because they have been divided"
26842,PREFACE.,into twelve or twenty-four books.
26843,PREFACE.,
26844,PREFACE.,"The ""Persae"" of Aeschylus afforded me the first model of my"
26845,PREFACE.,"conception, although the decision of the glorious contest now waging"
26846,PREFACE.,in Greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the
26847,PREFACE.,"return of Xerxes and the desolation of the Persians. I have,"
26848,PREFACE.,"therefore, contented myself with exhibiting a series of lyric"
26849,PREFACE.,"pictures, and with having wrought upon the curtain of futurity, which"
26850,PREFACE.,"falls upon the unfinished scene, such figures of indistinct and"
26851,PREFACE.,visionary delineation as suggest the final triumph of the Greek cause
26852,PREFACE.,as a portion of the cause of civilisation and social improvement.
26853,PREFACE.,
26854,PREFACE.,"The drama (if drama it must be called) is, however, so inartificial"
26855,PREFACE.,"that I doubt whether, if recited on the Thespian waggon to an Athenian"
26856,PREFACE.,"village at the Dionysiaca, it would have obtained the prize of the"
26857,PREFACE.,"goat. I shall bear with equanimity any punishment, greater than the"
26858,PREFACE.,"loss of such a reward, which the Aristarchi of the hour may think fit"
26859,PREFACE.,to inflict.
26860,PREFACE.,
26861,PREFACE.,"The only ""goat-song"" which I have yet attempted has, I confess, in"
26862,PREFACE.,"spite of the unfavourable nature of the subject, received a greater"
26863,PREFACE.,and a more valuable portion of applause than I expected or than it
26864,PREFACE.,deserved.
26865,PREFACE.,
26866,PREFACE.,Common fame is the only authority which I can allege for the details
26867,PREFACE.,"which form the basis of the poem, and I must trespass upon the"
26868,PREFACE.,forgiveness of my readers for the display of newspaper erudition to
26869,PREFACE.,"which I have been reduced. Undoubtedly, until the conclusion of the"
26870,PREFACE.,"war, it will be impossible to obtain an account of it sufficiently"
26871,PREFACE.,"authentic for historical materials; but poets have their privilege,"
26872,PREFACE.,and it is unquestionable that actions of the most exalted courage have
26873,PREFACE.,been performed by the Greeks--that they have gained more than one
26874,PREFACE.,"naval victory, and that their defeat in Wallachia was signalized by"
26875,PREFACE.,circumstances of heroism more glorious even than victory.
26876,PREFACE.,
26877,PREFACE.,The apathy of the rulers of the civilised world to the astonishing
26878,PREFACE.,circumstance of the descendants of that nation to which they owe their
26879,PREFACE.,"civilisation, rising as it were from the ashes of their ruin, is"
26880,PREFACE.,something perfectly inexplicable to a mere spectator of the shows of
26881,PREFACE.,"this mortal scene. We are all Greeks. Our laws, our literature, our"
26882,PREFACE.,"religion, our arts have their root in Greece. But for Greece--Rome,"
26883,PREFACE.,"the instructor, the conqueror, or the metropolis of our ancestors,"
26884,PREFACE.,"would have spread no illumination with her arms, and we might still"
26885,PREFACE.,"have been savages and idolaters; or, what is worse, might have arrived"
26886,PREFACE.,at such a stagnant and miserable state of social institution as China
26887,PREFACE.,and Japan possess.
26888,PREFACE.,
26889,PREFACE.,The human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in Greece
26890,PREFACE.,"which has impressed its image on those faultless productions, whose"
26891,PREFACE.,"very fragments are the despair of modern art, and has propagated"
26892,PREFACE.,"impulses which cannot cease, through a thousand channels of manifest"
26893,PREFACE.,"or imperceptible operation, to ennoble and delight mankind until the"
26894,PREFACE.,extinction of the race.
26895,PREFACE.,
26896,PREFACE.,The modern Greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the
26897,PREFACE.,imagination almost refuses to figure to itself as belonging to our
26898,PREFACE.,"kind, and he inherits much of their sensibility, their rapidity of"
26899,PREFACE.,"conception, their enthusiasm, and their courage. If in many instances"
26900,PREFACE.,he is degraded by moral and political slavery to the practice of the
26901,PREFACE.,basest vices it engenders--and that below the level of ordinary
26902,PREFACE.,degradation--let us reflect that the corruption of the best produces
26903,PREFACE.,"the worst, and that habits which subsist only in relation to a"
26904,PREFACE.,peculiar state of social institution may be expected to cease as soon
26905,PREFACE.,"as that relation is dissolved. In fact, the Greeks, since the"
26906,PREFACE.,admirable novel of Anastasius could have been a faithful picture of
26907,PREFACE.,"their manners, have undergone most important changes; the flower of"
26908,PREFACE.,"their youth, returning to their country from the universities of"
26909,PREFACE.,"Italy, Germany, and France, have communicated to their fellow-citizens"
26910,PREFACE.,the latest results of that social perfection of which their ancestors
26911,PREFACE.,were the original source. The University of Chios contained before the
26912,PREFACE.,"breaking out of the revolution eight hundred students, and among them"
26913,PREFACE.,several Germans and Americans. The munificence and energy of many of
26914,PREFACE.,"the Greek princes and merchants, directed to the renovation of their"
26915,PREFACE.,"country with a spirit and a wisdom which has few examples, is above"
26916,PREFACE.,all praise.
26917,PREFACE.,
26918,PREFACE.,The English permit their own oppressors to act according to their
26919,PREFACE.,"natural sympathy with the Turkish tyrant, and to brand upon their name"
26920,PREFACE.,the indelible blot of an alliance with the enemies of domestic
26921,PREFACE.,"happiness, of Christianity and civilisation."
26922,PREFACE.,
26923,PREFACE.,"Russia desires to possess, not to liberate Greece; and is contented to"
26924,PREFACE.,"see the Turks, its natural enemies, and the Greeks, its intended"
26925,PREFACE.,"slaves, enfeeble each other until one or both fall into its net. The"
26926,PREFACE.,wise and generous policy of England would have consisted in
26927,PREFACE.,"establishing the independence of Greece, and in maintaining it both"
26928,PREFACE.,against Russia and the Turk;--but when was the oppressor generous or
26929,PREFACE.,just?
26930,PREFACE.,
26931,PREFACE.,"[Should the English people ever become free, they will reflect upon"
26932,PREFACE.,the part which those who presume to represent their will have played
26933,PREFACE.,"in the great drama of the revival of liberty, with feelings which it"
26934,PREFACE.,would become them to anticipate. This is the age of the war of the
26935,PREFACE.,"oppressed against the oppressors, and every one of those ringleaders"
26936,PREFACE.,"of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers, called Sovereigns,"
26937,PREFACE.,"look to each other for aid against the common enemy, and suspend their"
26938,PREFACE.,mutual jealousies in the presence of a mightier fear. Of this holy
26939,PREFACE.,alliance all the despots of the earth are virtual members. But a new
26940,PREFACE.,"race has arisen throughout Europe, nursed in the abhorrence of the"
26941,PREFACE.,"opinions which are its chains, and she will continue to produce fresh"
26942,PREFACE.,generations to accomplish that destiny which tyrants foresee and
26943,PREFACE.,"dread. (This paragraph, suppressed in 1822 by Charles Ollier, was"
26944,PREFACE.,"first restored in 1892 by Mr. Buxton Forman [""Poetical Works of P. B."
26945,PREFACE.,"S."", volume 4 pages 40-41] from a proof copy of Hellas in his"
26946,PREFACE.,possession.]
26947,PREFACE.,
26948,PREFACE.,The Spanish Peninsula is already free. France is tranquil in the
26949,PREFACE.,enjoyment of a partial exemption from the abuses which its unnatural
26950,PREFACE.,and feeble government are vainly attempting to revive. The seed of
26951,PREFACE.,"blood and misery has been sown in Italy, and a more vigorous race is"
26952,PREFACE.,arising to go forth to the harvest. The world waits only the news of a
26953,PREFACE.,revolution of Germany to see the tyrants who have pinnacled themselves
26954,PREFACE.,on its supineness precipitated into the ruin from which they shall
26955,PREFACE.,"never arise. Well do these destroyers of mankind know their enemy,"
26956,PREFACE.,when they impute the insurrection in Greece to the same spirit before
26957,PREFACE.,"which they tremble throughout the rest of Europe, and that enemy well"
26958,PREFACE.,"knows the power and the cunning of its opponents, and watches the"
26959,PREFACE.,moment of their approaching weakness and inevitable division to wrest
26960,PREFACE.,the bloody sceptres from their grasp.

28835,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",The South of Europe was in a state of great political excitement at
28836,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",the beginning of the year 1821. The Spanish Revolution had been a

28840,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",early in 1821 the Austrians poured their armies into the Peninsula: at
28841,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a
28842,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",people long enslaved. The Piedmontese asserted their freedom; Genoa
28843,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","threw off the yoke of the King of Sardinia; and, as if in playful"
28844,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","imitation, the people of the little state of Massa and Carrara gave"

28846,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
28847,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil. It was said that the Austrian
28848,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","minister presented a list of sixty Carbonari to the Grand Duke, urging"
28849,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","their imprisonment; and the Grand Duke replied, 'I do not know whether"

28853,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","slumbered, they regarded the progress of the various Italian"
28854,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","revolutions with intense interest, and hatred for the Austrian was"
28855,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",warm in every bosom. But they had slender hopes; they knew that the
28856,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular German
28857,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","troops, and that the overthrow of the constitution in Naples would act"

28859,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",
28860,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",We have seen the rise and progress of reform. But the Holy Alliance
28861,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","was alive and active in those days, and few could dream of the"

28864,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","as, if it prevailed, the nations of the north would imitate the"
28865,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",example. Happily the reverse has proved the fact. The countries
28866,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","accustomed to the exercise of the privileges of freemen, to a limited"
28867,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","extent, have extended, and are extending, these limits. Freedom and"

28869,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","continue thus, we may hope for the durability of both. Then, as I have"
28870,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","said--in 1821--Shelley, as well as every other lover of liberty,"
28871,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",looked upon the struggles in Spain and Italy as decisive of the
28872,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","destinies of the world, probably for centuries to come. The interest"
28873,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",he took in the progress of affairs was intense. When Genoa declared
28874,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","itself free, his hopes were at their highest. Day after day he read"
28875,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","the bulletins of the Austrian army, and sought eagerly to gather"
28876,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",tokens of its defeat. He heard of the revolt of Genoa with emotions of
28877,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",transport. His whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause.
28878,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",We were living at Pisa at that time; and several well-informed

28884,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",While the fate of the progress of the Austrian armies then invading

28892,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",Mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of

28894,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.",often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in Greece; but we
28895,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","had no idea of its being so near at hand, when, on the 1st of April"
28896,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","1821, he called on Shelley, bringing the proclamation of his cousin,"
28897,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Prince Ypsilanti, and, radiant with exultation and delight, declared"

28900,"NOTE ON HELLAS, BY MRS. SHELLEY.","Shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in Spain and Naples, in two"
