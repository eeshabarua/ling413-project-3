92,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.
93,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,
94,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,
95,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"AS lovers, banished from their lady’s face"
96,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"And hopeless of her grace,"
97,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Fashion a ghostly sweetness in its place,"
98,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Fondly adore
99,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Some stealth-won cast attire she wore,"
100,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,A kerchief or a glove:
101,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,And at the lover’s beck
102,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Into the glove there fleets the hand,"
103,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Or at impetuous command
104,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Up from the kerchief floats the virgin neck:
105,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"So I, in very lowlihead of love,—"
106,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Too shyly reverencing
107,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,To let one thought’s light footfall smooth
108,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Tread near the living, consecrated thing,—"
109,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Treasure me thy cast youth.
110,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"This outworn vesture, tenantless of thee,"
111,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Hath yet my knee,"
112,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"For that, with show and semblance fair"
113,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Of the past Her
114,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Who once the beautiful, discarded raiment bare,"
115,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,It cheateth me.
116,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,As gale to gale drifts breath
117,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Of blossoms’ death,"
118,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,So dropping down the years from hour to hour
119,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,This dead youth’s scent is wafted me to-day:
120,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"I sit, and from the fragrance dream the flower."
121,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"So, then, she looked (I say);"
122,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,And so her front sunk down
123,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Heavy beneath the poet’s iron crown:
124,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,On her mouth museful sweet—
125,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,(Even as the twin lips meet)
126,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Did thought and sadness greet:
127,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Sighs
128,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,In those mournful eyes
129,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,So put on visibilities;
130,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"As viewless ether turns, in deep on deep, to dyes."
131,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Thus, long ago,"
132,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,She kept her meditative paces slow
133,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Through maiden meads, with wavèd shadow and gleam"
134,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Of locks half-lifted on the winds of dream,"
135,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Till love up-caught her to his chariot’s glow.
136,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Yet, voluntary, happier Proserpine!"
137,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,This drooping flower of youth thou lettest fall
138,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"I, faring in the cockshut-light, astray,"
139,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"Find on my ’lated way,"
140,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"And stoop, and gather for memorial,"
141,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"And lay it on my bosom, and make it mine."
142,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,"To this, the all of love the stars allow me,"
143,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,I dedicate and vow me.
144,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,I reach back through the days
145,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,A trothed hand to the dead the last trump shall not raise.
146,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,The water-wraith that cries
147,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,From those eternal sorrows of thy pictured eyes
148,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.,Entwines and draws me down their soundless intricacies!

155,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,
156,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,TOO wearily had we and song
157,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Been left to look and left to long,"
158,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Yea, song and we to long and look,"
159,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Since thine acquainted feet forsook
160,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,The mountain where the Muses hymn
161,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,For Sinai and the Seraphim.
162,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Now in both the mountains’ shine
163,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Dress thy countenance, twice divine!"
164,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,From Moses and the Muses draw
165,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,The Tables of thy double Law!
166,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,His rod-born fount and Castaly
167,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Let the one rock bring forth for thee,"
168,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Renewing so from either spring
169,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,The songs which both thy countries sing:
170,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Or we shall fear lest, heavened thus long,"
171,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Thou should’st forget thy native song,"
172,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,And mar thy mortal melodies
173,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,With broken stammer of the skies.
174,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,
175,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Ah! let the sweet birds of the Lord
176,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,With earth’s waters make accord;
177,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Teach how the crucifix may be
178,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Carven from the laurel-tree,"
179,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Fruit of the Hesperides
180,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Burnish take on Eden-trees,"
181,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,The Muses’ sacred grove be wet
182,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"With the red dew of Olivet,"
183,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,And Sappho lay her burning brows
184,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,In white Cecilia’s lap of snows!
185,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,
186,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Thy childhood must have felt the stings
187,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Of too divine o’ershadowings;
188,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Its odorous heart have been a blossom
189,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"That in darkness did unbosom,"
190,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Those fire-flies of God to invite,"
191,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Burning spirits, which by night"
192,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Bear upon their laden wing
193,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,To such hearts impregnating.
194,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,For flowers that night-wings fertilize
195,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Mock down the stars’ unsteady eyes,"
196,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"And with a happy, sleepless glance"
197,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Gaze the moon out of countenance.
198,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,I think thy girlhood’s watchers must
199,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Have took thy folded songs on trust,"
200,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"And felt them, as one feels the stir"
201,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Of still lightnings in the hair,"
202,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,When conscious hush expects the cloud
203,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,To speak the golden secret loud
204,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Which tacit air is privy to;
205,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Flasked in the grape the wine they knew,"
206,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Ere thy poet-mouth was able
207,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,For its first young starry babble.
208,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Keep’st thou not yet that subtle grace?
209,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Yea, in this silent interspace,"
210,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,God sets His poems in thy face!
211,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,
212,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"The loom which mortal verse affords,"
213,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Out of weak and mortal words,"
214,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Wovest thou thy singing-weed in,"
215,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,To a rune of thy far Eden.
216,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Vain are all disguises!  Ah,"
217,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Heavenly _incognita_!
218,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Thy mien bewrayeth through that wrong
219,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,The great Uranian House of Song!
220,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,As the vintages of earth
221,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Taste of the sun that riped their birth,"
222,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,We know what never cadent Sun
223,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,"Thy lampèd clusters throbbed upon,"
224,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,What plumed feet the winepress trod;
225,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Thy wine is flavorous of God.
226,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Whatever singing-robe thou wear
227,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Has the Paradisal air;
228,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,And some gold feather it has kept
229,TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.,Shows what Floor it lately swept!

238,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Within your spirit’s arms I stay me fast
239,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Against the fell
240,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Immitigate ravening of the gates of hell;
241,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"And claim my right in you, most hardly won,"

243,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Hold me and hold by me, lest both should fall"
244,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,(O in high escalade high companion!)
245,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Even in the breach of Heaven’s assaulted wall.
246,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Like to a wind-sown sapling grow I from
247,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"The clift, Sweet, of your skyward-jetting soul,—"
248,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Shook by all gusts that sweep it, overcome"
249,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,By all its clouds incumbent: O be true
250,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"To your soul, dearest, as my life to you!"
251,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"For if that soil grow sterile, then the whole"
252,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Of me must shrivel, from the topmost shoot"
253,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Of climbing poesy, and my life, killed through,"
254,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Dry down and perish to the foodless root.
255,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,
256,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Sweet Summer! unto you this swallow drew,"
257,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"By secret instincts inappeasable,"
258,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"That did direct him well,"
259,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Lured from his gelid North which wrought him wrong,"
260,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Wintered of sunning song;—
261,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"By happy instincts inappeasable,"
262,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Ah yes! that led him well,"
263,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Lured to the untried regions and the new
264,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Climes of auspicious you;
265,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"To twitter there, and in his singing dwell."
266,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"But ah! if you, my Summer, should grow waste,"
267,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"With grieving skies o’ercast,"
268,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,For such migration my poor wing was strong
269,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,But once; it has no power to fare again
270,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Forth o’er the heads of men,"
271,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Nor other Summers for its Sanctuary:
272,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,But from your mind’s chilled sky
273,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"It needs must drop, and lie with stiffened wings"
274,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Among your soul’s forlornest things;
275,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"A speck upon your memory, alack!"
276,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,A dead fly in a dusty window-crack.
277,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,
278,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,O therefore you who are
279,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"What words, being to such mysteries"
280,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"As raiment to the body is,"
281,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Should rather hide than tell;
282,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Chaste and intelligential love:
283,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Whose form is as a grove
284,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Hushed with the cooing of an unseen dove;
285,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Whose spirit to my touch thrills purer far
286,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Than is the tingling of a silver bell;
287,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Whose body other ladies well might bear
288,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"As soul,—yea, which it profanation were"
289,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"For all but you to take as fleshly woof,"
290,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Being spirit truest proof;
291,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Whose spirit sure is lineal to that
292,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Which sang _Magnificat_:
293,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Chastest, since such you are,"
294,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Take this curbed spirit of mine,"
295,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Which your own eyes invest with light divine,"
296,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,For lofty love and high auxiliar
297,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,In daily exalt emprise
298,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Which outsoars mortal eyes;
299,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"This soul which on your soul is laid,"
300,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,As maid’s breast against breast of maid;
301,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Beholding how your own I have engraved
302,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"On it, and with what purging thoughts have laved"
303,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,This love of mine from all mortality
304,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Indeed the copy is a painful one,"
305,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,And with long labour done!
306,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"O if you doubt the thing you are, lady,"
307,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Come then, and look in me;"
308,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Your beauty, Dian, dress and contemplate"
309,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,Within a pool to Dian consecrate!
310,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Unveil this spirit, lady, when you will,"
311,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,For unto all but you ’tis veilèd still:
312,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,"Unveil, and fearless gaze there, you alone,"
313,“MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.”,And if you love the image—’tis your own!

530,HER PORTRAIT.,Or if that language yet with us abode.
531,HER PORTRAIT.,Which Adam in the garden talked with God!
532,HER PORTRAIT.,But our untempered speech descends—poor heirs!
533,HER PORTRAIT.,Grimy and rough-cast still from Babel’s bricklayers:

536,HER PORTRAIT.,"A cheek, a lip, a limb, a bosom, they"

550,HER PORTRAIT.,

556,HER PORTRAIT.,Restrained to his once sacred benefice;

630,HER PORTRAIT.,God laid His fingers on the ivories
631,HER PORTRAIT.,"Of her pure members as on smoothèd keys,"

633,HER PORTRAIT.,I’ll speak a little proudly:—I disdain

635,HER PORTRAIT.,Which the dull daily fool can covet or obtain.
636,HER PORTRAIT.,"I do confess the fairness of the spoil,"
637,HER PORTRAIT.,But from such rivalry it takes a soil.
638,HER PORTRAIT.,For her I’ll proudlier speak:—how could it be
639,HER PORTRAIT.,That I should praise the gilding on the psaltery?
640,HER PORTRAIT.,"’Tis not for her to hold that prize a prize,"
641,HER PORTRAIT.,"Or praise much praise, though proudest in its wise,"
642,HER PORTRAIT.,To which even hopes of merely women rise.
643,HER PORTRAIT.,"Such strife would to the vanquished laurels yield,"
644,HER PORTRAIT.,Against _her_ suffered to have lost a field.
645,HER PORTRAIT.,"Herself must with herself be sole compeer,"
646,HER PORTRAIT.,Unless the people of her distant sphere
647,HER PORTRAIT.,Some gold migration send to melodise the year.
648,HER PORTRAIT.,"But first our hearts must burn in larger guise,"
649,HER PORTRAIT.,"To reformate the uncharitable skies,"
650,HER PORTRAIT.,And so the deathless plumage to acclimatise:
651,HER PORTRAIT.,"Since this, their sole congener in our clime,"
652,HER PORTRAIT.,"Droops her sad, ruffled thoughts for half the shivering time."
653,HER PORTRAIT.,
654,HER PORTRAIT.,Yet I have felt what terrors may consort
655,HER PORTRAIT.,"In women’s cheeks, the Graces’ soft resort;"
656,HER PORTRAIT.,"My hand hath shook at gentle hands’ access,"
657,HER PORTRAIT.,And trembled at the waving of a tress;
658,HER PORTRAIT.,"My blood known panic fear, and fled dismayed,"
659,HER PORTRAIT.,Where ladies’ eyes have set their ambuscade.
660,HER PORTRAIT.,The rustle of a robe hath been to me
661,HER PORTRAIT.,The very rattle of love’s musketry;
662,HER PORTRAIT.,"Although my heart hath beat the loud advance,"
663,HER PORTRAIT.,"I have recoiled before a challenging glance,"
664,HER PORTRAIT.,Proved gay alarms where warlike ribbons dance.
665,HER PORTRAIT.,"And from it all, this knowledge have I got,—"
666,HER PORTRAIT.,"The whole that others have, is less than they have not;"
667,HER PORTRAIT.,"All which makes other women noted fair,"
668,HER PORTRAIT.,Unnoted would remain and overshone in her.
669,HER PORTRAIT.,
670,HER PORTRAIT.,"How should I gauge what beauty is her dole,"
671,HER PORTRAIT.,Who cannot see her countenance for her soul;
672,HER PORTRAIT.,As birds see not the casement for the sky?
673,HER PORTRAIT.,"And as ’tis check they prove its presence by,"
674,HER PORTRAIT.,I know not of her body till I find
675,HER PORTRAIT.,My flight debarred the heaven of her mind.
676,HER PORTRAIT.,"Hers is the face whence all should copied be,"
677,HER PORTRAIT.,Did God make replicas of such as she;
678,HER PORTRAIT.,"Its presence felt by what it does abate,"
679,HER PORTRAIT.,Because the soul shines through tempered and mitigate:
680,HER PORTRAIT.,Where—as a figure labouring at night
681,HER PORTRAIT.,Beside the body of a splendid light—
682,HER PORTRAIT.,Dark Time works hidden by its luminousness;
683,HER PORTRAIT.,And every line he labours to impress
684,HER PORTRAIT.,"Turns added beauty, like the veins that run"
685,HER PORTRAIT.,Athwart a leaf which hangs against the sun.
686,HER PORTRAIT.,
687,HER PORTRAIT.,There regent Melancholy wide controls;
688,HER PORTRAIT.,There Earth- and Heaven-Love play for aureoles;

690,HER PORTRAIT.,"Like bubbles on dark water, or as flits"
691,HER PORTRAIT.,A sudden silver fin through its deep infinites;
692,HER PORTRAIT.,"There amorous Thought has sucked pale Fancy’s breath,"
693,HER PORTRAIT.,And Tenderness sits looking toward the lands of death
694,HER PORTRAIT.,"There Feeling stills her breathing with her hand,"
695,HER PORTRAIT.,And Dream from Melancholy part wrests the wand
696,HER PORTRAIT.,"And on this lady’s heart, looked you so deep,"
697,HER PORTRAIT.,Poor Poetry has rocked himself to sleep:

1198,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,His Bacchic fingers disentwine

1200,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,At thy festival;
1201,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,His revelling fingers disentwine
1202,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Leaf, flower, and all,"
1203,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And let them fall

1213,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,
1214,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,In crystal Heaven’s magic sphere

1225,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Of the sea with its blown and ruffled bosom;

1238,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Kneels on the Eastern sanctuary-stair.
1239,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,What is this feel of incense everywhere?

1242,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"The mighty spirit unknown,"
1243,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,That swingeth the slow earth before the embannered Throne?

1246,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"A presence everywhere,"
1247,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"An inarticulate prayer,"

1253,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Of this grave ending chant.
1254,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Round the earth still and stark
1255,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Heaven’s death-lights kindle, yellow spark by spark,"
1256,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Beneath the dreadful catafalque of the dark.
1257,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,
1258,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And I had ended there:
1259,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"But a great wind blew all the stars to flare,"
1260,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"And cried, “I sweep the path before the moon!"
1261,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Tarry ye now the coming of the moon,"
1262,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,For she is coming soon;”
1263,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Then died before the coming of the moon.
1264,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"And she came forth upon the trepidant air,"
1265,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"In vesture unimagined-fair,"
1266,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Woven as woof of flag-lilies;
1267,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And curdled as of flag-lilies
1268,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"The vapour at the feet of her,"
1269,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And a haze about her tinged in fainter wise.
1270,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"As if she had trodden the stars in press,"
1271,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Till the gold wine spurted over her dress,"
1272,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Till the gold wine gushed out round her feet;
1273,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Spouted over her stainèd wear,"
1274,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"And bubbled in golden froth at her feet,"
1275,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And hung like a whirlpool’s mist round her.
1276,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Still, mighty Season, do I see’t,"
1277,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Thy sway is still majestical!
1278,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Thou hold’st of God, by title sure,"
1279,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Thine indefeasible investiture,"
1280,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And that right round thy locks are native to;
1281,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"The heavens upon thy brow imperial,"
1282,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"This huge terrene thy ball,"
1283,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And o’er thy shoulders thrown wide air’s depending pall.
1284,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,What if thine earth be blear and bleak of hue?
1285,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Still, still the skies are sweet!"
1286,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Still, Season, still thou hast thy triumphs there!"
1287,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"How have I, unaware,"
1288,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Forgetful of my strain inaugural,"
1289,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Cleft the great rondure of thy reign complete,"
1290,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Yielding thee half, who hast indeed the all?"
1291,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,I will not think thy sovereignty begun
1292,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,But with the shepherd sun
1293,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,That washes in the sea the stars’ gold fleeces
1294,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Or that with day it ceases,"
1295,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Who sets his burning lips to the salt brine,"
1296,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And purples it to wine;
1297,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,While I behold how ermined Artemis
1298,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Ordainèd weed must wear,"
1299,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,And toil thy business;
1300,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"Who witness am of her,"
1301,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,Her too in autumn turned a vintager;
1302,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,"And, laden with its lampèd clusters bright,"
1303,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN.,The fiery-fruited vineyard of this night.

1307,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.
1308,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1309,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1310,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I FLED Him, down the nights and down the days;"
1311,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I fled Him, down the arches of the years;"
1312,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways"
1313,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears
1314,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I hid from Him, and under running laughter."
1315,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Up vistaed hopes, I sped;"
1316,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And shot, precipitated"
1317,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Adown Titanic glooms of chasmed fears,"
1318,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"From those strong Feet that followed, followed after."
1319,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"But with unhurrying chase,"
1320,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And unperturbéd pace,"
1321,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,"
1322,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,They beat—and a Voice beat
1323,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,More instant than the Feet—
1324,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“All things betray thee, who betrayest Me.”"
1325,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1326,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I pleaded, outlaw-wise,"
1327,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"By many a hearted casement, curtained red,"
1328,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Trellised with intertwining charities;
1329,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"(For, though I knew His love Who followéd,"
1330,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Yet was I sore adread
1331,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Lest, having Him, I must have naught beside)"
1332,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"But, if one little casement parted wide,"
1333,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,The gust of His approach would clash it to
1334,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Fear wist not to evade, as Love wist to pursue."
1335,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Across the margent of the world I fled,"
1336,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,"
1337,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Smiting for shelter on their changèd bars;
1338,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Fretted to dulcet jars
1339,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,And silvern chatter the pale ports o’ the moon.
1340,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I said to dawn: Be sudden—to eve: Be soon;
1341,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over
1342,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,From this tremendous Lover!
1343,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see!"
1344,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I tempted all His servitors, but to find"
1345,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"My own betrayal in their constancy,"
1346,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"In faith to Him their fickleness to me,"
1347,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Their traitorous trueness, and their loyal deceit."
1348,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,To all swift things for swiftness did I sue;
1349,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Clung to the whistling mane of every wind.
1350,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,"
1351,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,The long savannahs of the blue;
1352,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Or whether, Thunder-driven,"
1353,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"They clanged his chariot ’thwart a heaven,"
1354,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o’ their feet:—
1355,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.
1356,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Still with unhurrying chase,"
1357,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And unperturbèd pace,"
1358,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,"
1359,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Came on the following Feet,"
1360,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,And a Voice above their beat—
1361,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me.”"
1362,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1363,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I sought no more that, after which I strayed,"
1364,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,In face of man or maid;
1365,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,But still within the little children’s eyes
1366,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Seems something, something that replies,"
1367,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"_They_ at least are for me, surely for me!"
1368,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I turned me to them very wistfully;
1369,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair
1370,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"With dawning answers there,"
1371,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.
1372,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“Come then, ye other children, Nature’s—share"
1373,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,With me” (said I) “your delicate fellowship;
1374,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Let me greet you lip to lip,"
1375,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Let me twine with you caresses,"
1376,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Wantoning
1377,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"With our Lady-Mother’s vagrant tresses,"
1378,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Banqueting
1379,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"With her in her wind-walled palace,"
1380,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Underneath her azured daïs,"
1381,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Quaffing, as your taintless way is,"
1382,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,From a chalice
1383,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Lucent-weeping out of the dayspring.”
1384,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,So it was done:
1385,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,_I_ in their delicate fellowship was one—
1386,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Drew the bolt of Nature’s secrecies.
1387,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,_I_ knew all the swift importings
1388,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,On the wilful face of skies;
1389,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I knew how the clouds arise
1390,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Spumèd of the wild sea-snortings;
1391,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,All that’s born or dies
1392,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Rose and drooped with—made them shapers
1393,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine—"
1394,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,With them joyed and was bereaven.
1395,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I was heavy with the even,"
1396,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,When she lit her glimmering tapers
1397,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Round the day’s dead sanctities.
1398,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I laughed in the morning’s eyes.
1399,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,"
1400,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Heaven and I wept together,"
1401,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine;
1402,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Against the red throb of its sunset-heart
1403,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I laid my own to beat,"
1404,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,And share commingling heat;
1405,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart."
1406,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,In vain my tears were wet on Heaven’s grey cheek.
1407,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"For ah! we know not what each other says,"
1408,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,These things and I; in sound _I_ speak—
1409,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"_Their_ sound is but their stir, they speak by silences."
1410,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake my drouth;"
1411,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Let her, if she would owe me,"
1412,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Drop yon blue bosom-veil of sky, and show me"
1413,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,The breasts o’ her tenderness:
1414,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Never did any milk of hers once bless
1415,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,My thirsting mouth.
1416,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Nigh and nigh draws the chase,"
1417,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"With unperturbèd pace,"
1418,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Deliberate speed majestic instancy
1419,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,And past those noisèd Feet
1420,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,A voice comes yet more fleet—
1421,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“Lo! naught contents thee, who content’st not Me.”"
1422,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1423,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Naked I wait Thy love’s uplifted stroke!
1424,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"My harness piece by piece Thou hast hewn from me,"
1425,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,And smitten me to my knee;
1426,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I am defenceless utterly,"
1427,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I slept, methinks, and woke,"
1428,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And, slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep."
1429,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"In the rash lustihead of my young powers,"
1430,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I shook the pillaring hours
1431,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears,"
1432,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I stand amid the dust o’ the mounded years—
1433,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.
1434,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,"
1435,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.
1436,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Yea, faileth now even dream"
1437,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist;"
1438,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Even the linked fantasies, in whose blossomy twist"
1439,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist,"
1440,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Are yielding; cords of all too weak account
1441,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,For earth with heavy griefs so overplussed.
1442,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Ah! is Thy love indeed
1443,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed,"
1444,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?
1445,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Ah! must—
1446,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Designer infinite!—
1447,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Ah! must Thou char the wood ere Thou canst limn with it?
1448,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,My freshness spent its wavering shower i’ the dust;
1449,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"And now my heart is as a broken fount,"
1450,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever"
1451,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,From the dank thoughts that shiver
1452,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Upon the sighful branches of my mind.
1453,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Such is; what is to be?
1454,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?"
1455,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds;
1456,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds
1457,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"From the hid battlements of Eternity,"
1458,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Those shaken mists a space unsettle, then"
1459,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Round the half-glimpsèd turrets slowly wash again;
1460,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,But not ere him who summoneth
1461,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"I first have seen, enwound"
1462,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"With grooming robes purpureal, cypress-crowned;"
1463,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"His name I know, and what his trumpet saith."
1464,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Whether man’s heart or life it be which yields
1465,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Thee harvest, must Thy harvest fields"
1466,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Be dunged with rotten death?
1467,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Now of that long pursuit
1468,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Comes on at hand the bruit;
1469,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,That Voice is round me like a bursting sea:
1470,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“And is thy earth so marred,"
1471,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Shattered in shard on shard?
1472,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me!"
1473,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1474,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“Strange, piteous, futile thing!"
1475,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Wherefore should any set thee love apart?
1476,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Seeing none but I makes much of naught” (He said),"
1477,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,“And human love needs human meriting:
1478,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,How hast thou merited—
1479,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Of all man’s clotted clay the dingiest clot?
1480,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Alack, thou knowest not"
1481,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,How little worthy of any love thou art!
1482,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,"
1483,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Save Me, save only Me?"
1484,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"All which I took from thee I did but take,"
1485,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Not for thy harms,"
1486,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,But just that thou might’st seek it in My arms.
1487,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,All which thy child’s mistake
1488,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home:"
1489,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Rise, clasp My hand, and come.”"
1490,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,
1491,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,Halts by me that footfall:
1492,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Is my gloom, after all,"
1493,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly?"
1494,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"“Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,"
1495,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,I am He Whom thou seekest!
1496,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN.,"Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me.”"

1956,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"My song I do but hold for you in trust,"
1957,FRANCIS M. W. M.,I ask you but to blossom from my dust.
1958,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"When you have compassed all weak I began,"
1959,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Diviner poet, and ah! diviner man;"
1960,FRANCIS M. W. M.,The man at feud with the perduring child
1961,FRANCIS M. W. M.,In you before song’s altar nobly reconciled;
1962,FRANCIS M. W. M.,From the wise heavens I half shall smile to see
1963,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"How little a world, which owned you, needed me."
1964,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"If, while you keep the vigils of the night,"
1965,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"For your wild tears make darkness all too bright,"
1966,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Some lone orb through your lonely window peeps,"
1967,FRANCIS M. W. M.,As it played lover over your sweet sleeps;
1968,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Think it a golden crevice in the sky,"
1969,FRANCIS M. W. M.,Which I have pierced but to behold you by!
1970,FRANCIS M. W. M.,
1971,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"And when, immortal mortal, droops your head,"
1972,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"And you, the child of deathless song, are dead;"
1973,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Then, as you search with unaccustomed glance"
1974,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"The ranks of Paradise for my countenance,"
1975,FRANCIS M. W. M.,Turn not your tread along the Uranian sod
1976,FRANCIS M. W. M.,Among the bearded counsellors of God;
1977,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"For if in Eden as on earth are we,"
1978,FRANCIS M. W. M.,I sure shall keep a younger company:
1979,FRANCIS M. W. M.,Pass where beneath their rangèd gonfalons
1980,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"The starry cohorts shake their shielded suns,"
1981,FRANCIS M. W. M.,The dreadful mass of their enridgèd spears;
1982,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Pass where majestical the eternal peers,"
1983,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"The stately choice of the great Saintdom, meet—"
1984,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"A silvern segregation, globed complete"
1985,FRANCIS M. W. M.,In sandalled shadow of the Triune feet;
1986,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Pass by where wait, young poet-wayfarer,"
1987,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Your cousined clusters, emulous to share"
1988,FRANCIS M. W. M.,With you the roseal lightnings burning ’mid their hair;
1989,FRANCIS M. W. M.,"Pass the crystalline sea, the Lampads seven:—"

1996,TO MONICA.,
1997,TO MONICA.,
1998,TO MONICA.,SUMMER set lip to earth’s bosom bare.
1999,TO MONICA.,And left the flushed print in a poppy there:
2000,TO MONICA.,"Like a yawn of fire from the grass it came,"
2001,TO MONICA.,And the fanning wind puffed it to flapping flame.
2002,TO MONICA.,
2003,TO MONICA.,With burnt mouth red like a lion’s it drank
2004,TO MONICA.,"The blood of the sun as he slaughtered sank,"
2005,TO MONICA.,And dipped its cup in the purpurate shine
2006,TO MONICA.,When the eastern conduits ran with wine.
2007,TO MONICA.,
2008,TO MONICA.,"Till it grew lethargied with fierce bliss,"
2009,TO MONICA.,"And hot as a swinked gipsy is,"
2010,TO MONICA.,"And drowsed in sleepy savageries,"
2011,TO MONICA.,With mouth wide a-pout for a sultry kiss.
2012,TO MONICA.,
2013,TO MONICA.,"A child and man paced side by side,"
2014,TO MONICA.,Treading the skirts of eventide;
2015,TO MONICA.,But between the clasp of his hand and hers
2016,TO MONICA.,"Lay, felt not, twenty withered years."
2017,TO MONICA.,
2018,TO MONICA.,"She turned, with the rout of her dusk South hair,"
2019,TO MONICA.,And saw the sleeping gipsy there;
2020,TO MONICA.,"And snatched and snapped it in swift child’s whim,"
2021,TO MONICA.,"With—“Keep it, long as you live!”—to him."
2022,TO MONICA.,
2023,TO MONICA.,"And his smile, as nymphs from their laving meres,"
2024,TO MONICA.,Trembled up from a bath of tears;
2025,TO MONICA.,"And joy, like a mew sea-rocked apart,"
2026,TO MONICA.,Tossed on the wave of his troubled heart.
2027,TO MONICA.,
2028,TO MONICA.,"For _he_ saw what she did not see,"
2029,TO MONICA.,That—as kindled by its own fervency—
2030,TO MONICA.,The verge shrivelled inward smoulderingly:
2031,TO MONICA.,
2032,TO MONICA.,And suddenly ’twixt his hand and hers
2033,TO MONICA.,He knew the twenty withered years—
2034,TO MONICA.,"No flower, but twenty shrivelled years."
2035,TO MONICA.,
2036,TO MONICA.,"“Was never such thing until this hour,”"
2037,TO MONICA.,Low to his heart he said; “the flower
2038,TO MONICA.,"Of sleep brings wakening to me,"
2039,TO MONICA.,And of oblivion memory.”
2040,TO MONICA.,
2041,TO MONICA.,"“Was never this thing to me,” he said,"
2042,TO MONICA.,“Though with bruisèd poppies my feet are red!”
2043,TO MONICA.,And again to his own heart very low:
2044,TO MONICA.,"“O child!  I love, for I love and know;"
2045,TO MONICA.,
2046,TO MONICA.,"“But you, who love nor know at all"
2047,TO MONICA.,"The diverse chambers in Love’s guest-hall,"
2048,TO MONICA.,"Where some rise early, few sit long:"
2049,TO MONICA.,In how differing accents hear the throng
2050,TO MONICA.,His great Pentecostal tongue;
2051,TO MONICA.,
2052,TO MONICA.,"“Who know not love from amity,"
2053,TO MONICA.,Nor my reported self from me;
2054,TO MONICA.,"A fair fit gift is this, meseems,"
2055,TO MONICA.,You give—this withering flower of dreams.
2056,TO MONICA.,
2057,TO MONICA.,"“O frankly fickle, and fickly true,"
2058,TO MONICA.,Do you know what the days will do to you?
2059,TO MONICA.,"To your Love and you what the days will do,"
2060,TO MONICA.,"O frankly fickle, and fickly true?"
2061,TO MONICA.,
2062,TO MONICA.,"“You have loved me, Fair, three lives—or days:"
2063,TO MONICA.,’Twill pass with the passing of my face.
2064,TO MONICA.,"But where _I_ go, your face goes too,"
2065,TO MONICA.,To watch lest I play false to you.
2066,TO MONICA.,
2067,TO MONICA.,"“I am but, my sweet, your foster-lover,"
2068,TO MONICA.,Knowing well when certain years are over
2069,TO MONICA.,You vanish from me to another;
2070,TO MONICA.,"Yet I know, and love, like the foster-mother."
2071,TO MONICA.,
2072,TO MONICA.,"“So, frankly fickle, and fickly true!"
2073,TO MONICA.,For my brief life—while I take from you
2074,TO MONICA.,"This token, fair and fit, meseems,"
2075,TO MONICA.,For me—this withering flower of dreams.”
2076,TO MONICA.,
2077,TO MONICA.,* * * * * * *
2078,TO MONICA.,
2079,TO MONICA.,"The sleep-flower sways in the wheat its head,"
2080,TO MONICA.,"Heavy with dreams, as that with bread:"
2081,TO MONICA.,The goodly grain and the sun-flushed sleeper
2082,TO MONICA.,"The reaper reaps, and Time the reaper."
2083,TO MONICA.,
2084,TO MONICA.,"I hang ’mid men my needless head,"
2085,TO MONICA.,"And my fruit is dreams, as theirs is bread:"
2086,TO MONICA.,The goodly men and the sun-hazed sleeper
2087,TO MONICA.,"Time shall reap, but after the reaper"
2088,TO MONICA.,"The world shall glean of me, me the sleeper!"
2089,TO MONICA.,
2090,TO MONICA.,Love! love! your flower of withered dream
2091,TO MONICA.,"In leavèd rhyme lies safe, I deem,"
2092,TO MONICA.,"Sheltered and shut in a nook of rhyme,"
2093,TO MONICA.,"From the reaper man, and his reaper Time."
2094,TO MONICA.,
2095,TO MONICA.,Love! _I_ fall into the claws of Time:
2096,TO MONICA.,But lasts within a leavèd rhyme
2097,TO MONICA.,All that the world of me esteems—
2098,TO MONICA.,"My withered dreams, my withered dreams."

2105,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"YOU, O the piteous you!"
2106,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Who all the long night through
2107,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Anticipatedly
2108,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Disclose yourself to me
2109,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Already in the ways
2110,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Beyond our human comfortable days;
2111,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,How can you deem what Death
2112,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Impitiably saith
2113,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"To me, who listening wake"
2114,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,For your poor sake?
2115,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,When a grown woman dies
2116,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,You know we think unceasingly
2117,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"What things she said, how sweet, how wise;"
2118,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,And these do make our misery.
2119,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,But you were (you to me
2120,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,The dead anticipatedly!)
2121,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"You—eleven years, was’t not, or so?—"
2122,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Were just a child, you know;"
2123,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,And so you never said
2124,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Things sweet immeditatably and wise
2125,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,To interdict from closure my wet eyes:
2126,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"But foolish things, my dead, my dead!"
2127,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Little and laughable,"
2128,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Your age that fitted well.
2129,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"And was it such things all unmemorable,"
2130,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Was it such things could make
2131,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Me sob all night for your implacable sake?
2132,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,
2133,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Yet, as you said to me,"
2134,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"In pretty make-believe of revelry,"
2135,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,So the night long said Death
2136,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,With his magniloquent breath;
2137,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,(And that remembered laughter
2138,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Which in our daily uses followed after,"
2139,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Was all untuned to pity and to awe):
2140,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"“_A cup of chocolate_,"
2141,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"_One farthing is the rate_,"
2142,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,_You drink it through a straw_.”
2143,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,
2144,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"How could I know, how know"

2147,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"My dear, was’t worth his breath,"
2148,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"His mighty utterance?—yet he saith, and saith!"
2149,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,This dreadful Death to his own dreadfulness
2150,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Doth dreadful wrong,"
2151,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,This dreadful childish babble on his tongue!
2152,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"That iron tongue made to speak sentences,"
2153,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"And wisdom insupportably complete,"
2154,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Why should it only say the long night through,"
2155,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"In mimicry of you,—"
2156,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"“_A cup of chocolate_,"
2157,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"_One farthing is the rate_,"
2158,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"_You drink it through a straw_, _a straw_, _a straw_!”"
2159,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Oh, of all sentences,"
2160,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Piercingly incomplete!
2161,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Why did you teach that fatal mouth to draw,"
2162,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Child, impermissible awe,"
2163,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,From your old trivialness?
2164,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Why have you done me this
2165,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Most unsustainable wrong,"
2166,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,And into Death’s control
2167,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Betrayed the secret places of my soul?
2168,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Teaching him that his lips,"
2169,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Uttering their native earthquake and eclipse,"
2170,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Could never so avail
2171,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,To rend from hem to hem the ultimate veil
2172,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Of this most desolate
2173,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Spirit, and leave it stripped and desecrate,—"
2174,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"Nay, never so have wrung"
2175,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"From eyes and speech weakness unmanned, unmeet;"
2176,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,As when his terrible dotage to repeat
2177,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Its little lesson learneth at your feet;
2178,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,As when he sits among
2179,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"His sepulchres, to play"
2180,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"With broken toys your hand has cast away,"
2181,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,With derelict trinkets of the darling young.
2182,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,Why have you taught—that he might so complete
2183,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,His awful panoply
2184,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"From your cast playthings—why,"
2185,TO MONICA THOUGHT DYING.,"This dreadful childish babble to his tongue,"
