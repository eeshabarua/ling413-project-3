65,POET LAUREATE,This book in its progress has recalled often to my memory a man with
66,POET LAUREATE,"whose friendship we were once honoured, to whom no region of English"
67,POET LAUREATE,"Literature was unfamiliar, and who, whilst rich in all the noble gifts"
68,POET LAUREATE,"of Nature, was most eminently distinguished by the noblest and the"
69,POET LAUREATE,"rarest,--just judgment and high-hearted patriotism. It would have been"
70,POET LAUREATE,hence a peculiar pleasure and pride to dedicate what I have
71,POET LAUREATE,endeavoured to make a true national Anthology of three centuries to
72,POET LAUREATE,Henry Hallam. But he is beyond the reach of any human tokens of love
73,POET LAUREATE,and reverence; and I desire therefore to place before it a name united
74,POET LAUREATE,"with his by associations which, while Poetry retains her hold on the"
75,POET LAUREATE,"minds of Englishmen, are not likely to be forgotten."
76,POET LAUREATE,
77,POET LAUREATE,"Your encouragement, given while traversing the wild scenery of Treryn"
78,POET LAUREATE,"Dinas, led me to begin the work; and it has been completed under your"
79,POET LAUREATE,advice and assistance. For the favour now asked I have thus a second
80,POET LAUREATE,"reason: and to this I may add, the homage which is your right as Poet,"
81,POET LAUREATE,"and the gratitude due to a Friend, whose regard I rate at no common"
82,POET LAUREATE,value.
83,POET LAUREATE,
84,POET LAUREATE,"Permit me then to inscribe to yourself a book which, I hope, may be"
85,POET LAUREATE,found by many a lifelong fountain of innocent and exalted pleasure; a
86,POET LAUREATE,source of animation to friends when they meet; and able to sweeten
87,POET LAUREATE,"solitude itself with best society,--with the companionship of the wise"
88,POET LAUREATE,"and the good, with the beauty which the eye cannot see, and the music"
89,POET LAUREATE,only heard in silence. If this Collection proves a store-house of
90,POET LAUREATE,"delight to Labour and to Poverty,--if it teaches those indifferent to"
91,POET LAUREATE,"the Poets to love them, and those who love them to love them more, the"
92,POET LAUREATE,aim and the desire entertained in framing it will be fully
93,POET LAUREATE,accomplished.

106,PREFACE,
107,PREFACE,"This little Collection differs, it is believed, from others in the"
108,PREFACE,attempt made to include in it all the best original Lyrical pieces and
109,PREFACE,Songs in our language (save a very few regretfully omitted on account
110,PREFACE,"of length), by writers not living,--and none beside the best. Many"
111,PREFACE,familiar verses will hence be met with; many also which should be
112,PREFACE,familiar:--the Editor will regard as his fittest readers those who
113,PREFACE,"love Poetry so well, that he can offer them nothing not already known"
114,PREFACE,and valued.
115,PREFACE,
116,PREFACE,The Editor is acquainted with no strict and exhaustive definition of
117,PREFACE,Lyrical Poetry; but he has found the task of practical decision
118,PREFACE,"increase in clearness and in facility as he advanced with the work,"
119,PREFACE,whilst keeping in view a few simple principles. Lyrical has been here
120,PREFACE,held essentially to imply that each Poem shall turn on some single
121,PREFACE,"thought, feeling, or situation. In accordance with this, narrative,"
122,PREFACE,"descriptive, and didactic poems,--unless accompanied by rapidity of"
123,PREFACE,"movement, brevity, and the colouring of human passion,--have been"
124,PREFACE,"excluded. Humourous poetry, except in the very unfrequent instances"
125,PREFACE,"where a truly poetical tone pervades the whole, with what is strictly"
126,PREFACE,"personal, occasional, and religious, has been considered foreign to"
127,PREFACE,"the idea of the book. Blank verse and the ten-syllable couplet, with"
128,PREFACE,"all pieces markedly dramatic, have been rejected as alien from what is"
129,PREFACE,"commonly understood by Song, and rarely conforming to Lyrical"
130,PREFACE,"conditions in treatment. But it is not anticipated, nor is it"
131,PREFACE,"possible, that all readers shall think the line accurately drawn. Some"
132,PREFACE,"poems, as Gray's Elegy, the Allegro and Penseroso, Wordsworth's Ruth"
133,PREFACE,"or Campbell's Lord Ullin, might be claimed with perhaps equal justice"
134,PREFACE,for a narrative or descriptive selection: whilst with reference
135,PREFACE,"especially to Ballads and Sonnets, the Editor can only state that he"
136,PREFACE,has taken his utmost pains to decide without caprice or partiality.
137,PREFACE,
138,PREFACE,This also is all he can plead in regard to a point even more liable to
139,PREFACE,question;--what degree of merit should give rank among the Best. That
140,PREFACE,"a poem shall be worthy of the writer's genius,--that it shall reach a"
141,PREFACE,"perfection commensurate with its aim,--that we should require finish"
142,PREFACE,"in proportion to brevity,--that passion, colour, and originality"
143,PREFACE,"cannot atone for serious imperfections in clearness, unity or"
144,PREFACE,"truth,--that a few good lines do not make a good poem, that popular"
145,PREFACE,"estimate is serviceable as a guidepost more than as a compass,--above"
146,PREFACE,"all, that excellence should be looked for rather in the whole than in"
147,PREFACE,"the parts,--such and other such canons have been always steadily"
148,PREFACE,"regarded. He may however add that the pieces chosen, and a far larger"
149,PREFACE,"number rejected, have been carefully and repeatedly considered; and"
150,PREFACE,that he has been aided throughout by two friends of independent and
151,PREFACE,"exercised judgment, besides the distinguished person addressed in the"
152,PREFACE,Dedication. It is hoped that by this procedure the volume has been
153,PREFACE,freed from that one-sidedness which must beset individual
154,PREFACE,decisions:--but for the final choice the Editor is alone responsible.
155,PREFACE,
156,PREFACE,"Chalmers' vast collection, with the whole works of all accessible"
157,PREFACE,"poets not contained in it, and the best Anthologies of different"
158,PREFACE,"periods, have been twice systematically read through: and it is hence"
159,PREFACE,improbable that any omissions which may be regretted are due to
160,PREFACE,"oversight. The poems are printed entire, except in a very few"
161,PREFACE,instances where a stanza or passage has been omitted. These omissions
162,PREFACE,have been risked only when the piece could be thus brought to a closer
163,PREFACE,"lyrical unity: and, as essentially opposed to this unity, extracts,"
164,PREFACE,"obviously such, are excluded. In regard to the text, the purpose of"
165,PREFACE,the book has appeared to justify the choice of the most poetical
166,PREFACE,"version, wherever more than one exists; and much labour has been given"
167,PREFACE,"to present each poem, in disposition, spelling, and punctuation, to"
168,PREFACE,the greatest advantage.
169,PREFACE,
170,PREFACE,"In the arrangement, the most poetically-effective order has been"
171,PREFACE,attempted. The English mind has passed through phases of thought and
172,PREFACE,cultivation so various and so opposed during these three centuries of
173,PREFACE,"Poetry, that a rapid passage between old and new, like rapid"
174,PREFACE,"alteration of the eye's focus in looking at the landscape, will always"
175,PREFACE,be wearisome and hurtful to the sense of Beauty. The poems have been
176,PREFACE,"therefore distributed into Books corresponding, I to the ninety years"
177,PREFACE,"closing about 1616, II thence to 1700, III to 1800, IV to the half"
178,PREFACE,"century just ended. Or, looking at the Poets who more or less give"
179,PREFACE,"each portion its distinctive character, they might be called the Books"
180,PREFACE,"of Shakespeare, Milton, Gray, and Wordsworth. The volume, in this"
181,PREFACE,"respect, so far as the limitations of its range allow, accurately"
182,PREFACE,reflects the natural growth and evolution of our Poetry. A rigidly
183,PREFACE,"chronological sequence, however, rather fits a collection aiming at"
184,PREFACE,"instruction than at pleasure, and the wisdom which comes through"
185,PREFACE,pleasure:--within each book the pieces have therefore been arranged in
186,PREFACE,gradations of feeling or subject. And it is hoped that the contents of
187,PREFACE,"this Anthology will thus be found to present a certain unity, 'as"
188,PREFACE,"episodes,' in the noble language of Shelley, 'to that great Poem which"
189,PREFACE,"all poets, like the co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have"
190,PREFACE,built up since the beginning of the world.'
191,PREFACE,
192,PREFACE,"As he closes his long survey, the Editor trusts he may add without"
193,PREFACE,"egotism, that he has found the vague general verdict of popular Fame"
194,PREFACE,"more just than those have thought, who, with too severe a criticism,"
195,PREFACE,would confine judgments on Poetry to 'the selected few of many
196,PREFACE,generations.' Not many appear to have gained reputation without some
197,PREFACE,"gift or performance that, in due degree, deserved it: and if no verses"
198,PREFACE,"by certain writers who show less strength than sweetness, or more"
199,PREFACE,"thought than mastery of expression, are printed in this volume, it"
200,PREFACE,should not be imagined that they have been excluded without much
201,PREFACE,"hesitation and regret,--far less that they have been slighted."
202,PREFACE,"Throughout this vast and pathetic array of Singers now silent, few"
203,PREFACE,"have been honoured with the name Poet, and have not possessed a skill"
204,PREFACE,"in words, a sympathy with beauty, a tenderness of feeling, or"
205,PREFACE,"seriousness in reflection, which render their works, although never"
206,PREFACE,perhaps attaining that loftier and finer excellence here
207,PREFACE,"required,--better worth reading than much of what fills the scanty"
208,PREFACE,"hours that most men spare for self-improvement, or for pleasure in any"
209,PREFACE,of its more elevated and permanent forms.--And if this be true of even
210,PREFACE,"mediocre poetry, for how much more are we indebted to the best! Like"
211,PREFACE,"the fabled fountain of the Azores, but with a more various power, the"
212,PREFACE,magic of this Art can confer on each period of life its appropriate
213,PREFACE,"blessing: on early years Experience, on maturity Calm, on age,"
214,PREFACE,"Youthfulness. Poetry gives treasures 'more golden than gold,' leading"
215,PREFACE,"us in higher and healthier ways than those of the world, and"
216,PREFACE,interpreting to us the lessons of Nature. But she speaks best for
217,PREFACE,"herself. Her true accents, if the plan has been executed with success,"
218,PREFACE,may be heard throughout the following pages:--wherever the Poets of
219,PREFACE,"England are honoured, wherever the dominant language of the world is"
220,PREFACE,"spoken, it is hoped that they will find fit audience."
221,PREFACE,
222,PREFACE,1861
223,PREFACE,
224,PREFACE,"Some poems, especially in Book I, have been added:--either on better"
225,PREFACE,acquaintance;--in deference to critical suggestions;--or unknown to
226,PREFACE,the Editor when first gathering his harvest. For aid in these
227,PREFACE,after-gleanings he is specially indebted to the excellent reprints of
228,PREFACE,"rare early verse given us by Dr. Hannah, Dr. Grosart, Mr. Arber, Mr."
229,PREFACE,"Bullen, and others,--and (in regard to the additions of 1883) to the"
230,PREFACE,"advice of that distinguished Friend, by whom the final choice has been"
231,PREFACE,so largely guided. The text has also been carefully revised from
232,PREFACE,"authoritative sources. It has still seemed best, for many reasons, to"
233,PREFACE,retain the original limit by which the selection was confined to those
234,PREFACE,"then no longer living. But the editor hopes that, so far as in him"
235,PREFACE,"lies, a complete and definitive collection of our best Lyrics, to the"
236,PREFACE,"central year of this fast-closing century, is now offered."

2312,_PROTHALAMION_,
2313,_PROTHALAMION_,"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,"

2334,_PROTHALAMION_,"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,"
2335,_PROTHALAMION_,All which upon those goodly birds they threw

2339,_PROTHALAMION_,"Scatter'd with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,"
2340,_PROTHALAMION_,"That they appear, through lilies' plenteous store,"
2341,_PROTHALAMION_,Like a bride's chamber-floor.
2342,_PROTHALAMION_,Two of those nymphs meanwhile two garlands bound
2343,_PROTHALAMION_,"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,"

2354,_PROTHALAMION_,"Joy may you have, and gentle heart's content"
2355,_PROTHALAMION_,Of your love's couplement;
2356,_PROTHALAMION_,"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,"
2357,_PROTHALAMION_,"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,"
2358,_PROTHALAMION_,"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove"
2359,_PROTHALAMION_,"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile"
2360,_PROTHALAMION_,For ever to assoil.
2361,_PROTHALAMION_,"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,"
2362,_PROTHALAMION_,And blesséd plenty wait upon your board;

2364,_PROTHALAMION_,That fruitful issue may to you afford
2365,_PROTHALAMION_,"Which may your foes confound,"

2372,_PROTHALAMION_,Which said their bridal day should not be long:
2373,_PROTHALAMION_,And gentle Echo from the neighbour ground
2374,_PROTHALAMION_,Their accents did resound.
2375,_PROTHALAMION_,So forth those joyous birds did pass along
2376,_PROTHALAMION_,"Adown the Lee that to them murmur'd low,"
2377,_PROTHALAMION_,As he would speak but that he lack'd a tongue;
2378,_PROTHALAMION_,"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,"
2379,_PROTHALAMION_,Making his stream run slow.

2399,_PROTHALAMION_,"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,"
2400,_PROTHALAMION_,Where oft I gainéd gifts and goodly grace
2401,_PROTHALAMION_,"Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,"
2402,_PROTHALAMION_,Whose want too well now feels my friendless case;
2403,_PROTHALAMION_,But ah! here fits not well

2419,_PROTHALAMION_,"Thy country may be freed from foreign harms,"

3260,_LYCIDAS_,Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear
3261,_LYCIDAS_,Compels me to disturb your season due:
3262,_LYCIDAS_,"For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,"
3263,_LYCIDAS_,"Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer."
3264,_LYCIDAS_,Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
3265,_LYCIDAS_,"Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme."
3266,_LYCIDAS_,He must not float upon his watery bier

3275,_LYCIDAS_,With lucky words favour my destined urn;
3276,_LYCIDAS_,"And as he passes, turn"
3277,_LYCIDAS_,And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.
3278,_LYCIDAS_,
3279,_LYCIDAS_,"For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,"
3280,_LYCIDAS_,"Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill:"
3281,_LYCIDAS_,"Together both, ere the high lawns appear'd"
3282,_LYCIDAS_,"Under the opening eyelids of the Morn,"
3283,_LYCIDAS_,"We drove a-field, and both together heard"

3285,_LYCIDAS_,"Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,"
3286,_LYCIDAS_,Oft till the star that rose at evening bright
3287,_LYCIDAS_,Toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.
3288,_LYCIDAS_,"Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,"
3289,_LYCIDAS_,"Temper'd to the oaten flute,"
3290,_LYCIDAS_,"Rough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel"
3291,_LYCIDAS_,From the glad sound would not be absent long;
3292,_LYCIDAS_,And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.

3298,_LYCIDAS_,"And all their echoes, mourn:"
3299,_LYCIDAS_,The willows and the hazel copses green
3300,_LYCIDAS_,Shall now no more be seen
3301,_LYCIDAS_,Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays:--
3302,_LYCIDAS_,"As killing as the canker to the rose,"

3304,_LYCIDAS_,"Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear"

3306,_LYCIDAS_,"Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear."
3307,_LYCIDAS_,
3308,_LYCIDAS_,"Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep"
3309,_LYCIDAS_,Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?
3310,_LYCIDAS_,For neither were ye playing on the steep
3311,_LYCIDAS_,"Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,"
3312,_LYCIDAS_,"Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,"
3313,_LYCIDAS_,Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:
3314,_LYCIDAS_,Ay me! I fondly dream--
3315,_LYCIDAS_,Had ye been there ... For what could that have done?
3316,_LYCIDAS_,"What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,"
3317,_LYCIDAS_,"The Muse herself, for her enchanting son,"
3318,_LYCIDAS_,"Whom universal nature did lament,"
3319,_LYCIDAS_,When by the rout that made the hideous roar
3320,_LYCIDAS_,"His gory visage down the stream was sent,"
3321,_LYCIDAS_,Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?
3322,_LYCIDAS_,
3323,_LYCIDAS_,Alas! what boots it with uncessant care
3324,_LYCIDAS_,"To tend the homely, slighted, shepherd's trade"
3325,_LYCIDAS_,And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?
3326,_LYCIDAS_,"Were it not better done, as others use,"
3327,_LYCIDAS_,"To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,"
3328,_LYCIDAS_,Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?
3329,_LYCIDAS_,Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
3330,_LYCIDAS_,(That last infirmity of noble mind)
3331,_LYCIDAS_,"To scorn delights, and live laborious days;"
3332,_LYCIDAS_,"But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,"
3333,_LYCIDAS_,"And think to burst out into sudden blaze,"
3334,_LYCIDAS_,Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears
3335,_LYCIDAS_,And slits the thin-spun life.  'But not the praise'
3336,_LYCIDAS_,"Phoebus replied, and touch'd my trembling ears;"
3337,_LYCIDAS_,"'Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,"
3338,_LYCIDAS_,Nor in the glistering foil
3339,_LYCIDAS_,"Set off to the world, nor in broad rumour lies:"
3340,_LYCIDAS_,But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
3341,_LYCIDAS_,And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;
3342,_LYCIDAS_,"As he pronounces lastly on each deed,"
3343,_LYCIDAS_,Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.'
3344,_LYCIDAS_,
3345,_LYCIDAS_,"O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd flood"
3346,_LYCIDAS_,"Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocal reeds,"
3347,_LYCIDAS_,That strain I heard was of a higher mood.
3348,_LYCIDAS_,"But now my oat proceeds,"
3349,_LYCIDAS_,And listens to the herald of the sea
3350,_LYCIDAS_,That came in Neptune's plea;
3351,_LYCIDAS_,"He ask'd the waves, and ask'd the felon winds,"
3352,_LYCIDAS_,What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?
3353,_LYCIDAS_,And question'd every gust of rugged wings
3354,_LYCIDAS_,That blows from off each beaked promontory:
3355,_LYCIDAS_,They knew not of his story;
3356,_LYCIDAS_,"And sage Hippotadés their answer brings,"
3357,_LYCIDAS_,That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd;
3358,_LYCIDAS_,"The air was calm, and on the level brine"
3359,_LYCIDAS_,Sleek Panopé with all her sisters play'd.
3360,_LYCIDAS_,It was that fatal and perfidious bark
3361,_LYCIDAS_,"Built in the eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,"
3362,_LYCIDAS_,That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
3363,_LYCIDAS_,

3365,_LYCIDAS_,"His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge"
3366,_LYCIDAS_,"Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge"
3367,_LYCIDAS_,Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe:
3368,_LYCIDAS_,"'Ah! who hath reft,' quoth he, 'my dearest pledge!'"
3369,_LYCIDAS_,"Last came, and last did go"
3370,_LYCIDAS_,The Pilot of the Galilean lake;
3371,_LYCIDAS_,Two massy keys he bore of metals twain
3372,_LYCIDAS_,"(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain);"
3373,_LYCIDAS_,"He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:"
3374,_LYCIDAS_,"'How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,"
3375,_LYCIDAS_,"Enow of such, as for their bellies' sake"
3376,_LYCIDAS_,Creep and intrude and climb into the fold!
3377,_LYCIDAS_,Of other care they little reckoning make
3378,_LYCIDAS_,Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast.
3379,_LYCIDAS_,And shove away the worthy bidden guest.
3380,_LYCIDAS_,Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
3381,_LYCIDAS_,"A sheep-hook, or have learn'd aught else the least"
3382,_LYCIDAS_,That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!
3383,_LYCIDAS_,What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
3384,_LYCIDAS_,"And when they list, their lean and flashy songs"
3385,_LYCIDAS_,Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
3386,_LYCIDAS_,"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,"
3387,_LYCIDAS_,But swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw
3388,_LYCIDAS_,"Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:"
3389,_LYCIDAS_,Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
3390,_LYCIDAS_,"Daily devours apace, and nothing said:"
3391,_LYCIDAS_,--But that two-handed engine at the door
3392,_LYCIDAS_,"Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.'"
3393,_LYCIDAS_,
3394,_LYCIDAS_,"Return, Alphéus; the dread voice is past"
3395,_LYCIDAS_,"That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse,"
3396,_LYCIDAS_,"And call the vales, and bid them hither cast"
3397,_LYCIDAS_,Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.
3398,_LYCIDAS_,"Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use"
3399,_LYCIDAS_,"Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks"
3400,_LYCIDAS_,On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks;
3401,_LYCIDAS_,Throw hither all your quaint enamell'd eyes
3402,_LYCIDAS_,That on the green turf suck the honey'd showers
3403,_LYCIDAS_,And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
3404,_LYCIDAS_,"Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,"
3405,_LYCIDAS_,"The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,"
3406,_LYCIDAS_,"The white pink, and the pansy freak'd with jet,"
3407,_LYCIDAS_,"The glowing violet,"
3408,_LYCIDAS_,"The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,"
3409,_LYCIDAS_,"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,"
3410,_LYCIDAS_,And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
3411,_LYCIDAS_,"Bid amarantus all his beauty shed,"
3412,_LYCIDAS_,And daffadillies fill their cups with tears
3413,_LYCIDAS_,To strew the laureat hearse where Lycid lies.
3414,_LYCIDAS_,"For so to interpose a little ease,"
3415,_LYCIDAS_,Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise:--
3416,_LYCIDAS_,Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
3417,_LYCIDAS_,"Wash far away,--where'er thy bones are hurl'd,"
3418,_LYCIDAS_,Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides
3419,_LYCIDAS_,"Where thou perhaps, under the whelming tide,"
3420,_LYCIDAS_,Visitest the bottom of the monstrous world;
3421,_LYCIDAS_,"Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,"
3422,_LYCIDAS_,"Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,"
3423,_LYCIDAS_,Where the great Vision of the guarded mount
3424,_LYCIDAS_,"Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold,"
3425,_LYCIDAS_,"--Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:"
3426,_LYCIDAS_,"--And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth!"
3427,_LYCIDAS_,
3428,_LYCIDAS_,"Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,"
3429,_LYCIDAS_,"For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,"
3430,_LYCIDAS_,Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor:
3431,_LYCIDAS_,"So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,"
3432,_LYCIDAS_,And yet anon repairs his drooping head
3433,_LYCIDAS_,"And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore"
3434,_LYCIDAS_,Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
3435,_LYCIDAS_,"So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high"
3436,_LYCIDAS_,Through the dear might of Him that walk'd the waves;
3437,_LYCIDAS_,"Where, other groves and other streams along,"
3438,_LYCIDAS_,"With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,"
3439,_LYCIDAS_,And hears the unexpressive nuptial song
3440,_LYCIDAS_,In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.
3441,_LYCIDAS_,There entertain him all the Saints above
3442,_LYCIDAS_,"In solemn troops, and sweet societies,"
3443,_LYCIDAS_,"That sing, and singing, in their glory move,"
3444,_LYCIDAS_,And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
3445,_LYCIDAS_,"Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;"
3446,_LYCIDAS_,Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore
3447,_LYCIDAS_,"In thy large recompense, and shalt be good"
3448,_LYCIDAS_,To all that wander in that perilous flood.
3449,_LYCIDAS_,
3450,_LYCIDAS_,"Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,"
3451,_LYCIDAS_,While the still morn went out with sandals gray;
3452,_LYCIDAS_,"He touch'd the tender stops of various quills,"
3453,_LYCIDAS_,With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:
3454,_LYCIDAS_,"And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills,"
3455,_LYCIDAS_,And now was dropt into the western bay:
3456,_LYCIDAS_,"At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue:"
3457,_LYCIDAS_,"To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new."

10614,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,As they drifted on their path
10615,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"There was silence deep as death,"
10616,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,And the boldest held his breath
10617,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,For a time.
10618,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,
10619,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,But the might of England flush'd
10620,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,To anticipate the scene;
10621,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,And her van the fleeter rush'd
10622,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,O'er the deadly space between.
10623,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"'Hearts of oak!' our captains cried, when each gun"
10624,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,From its adamantine lips
10625,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"Spread a death-shade round the ships,"
10626,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Like the hurricane eclipse
10627,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Of the sun.
10628,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,
10629,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Again! again! again!
10630,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"And the havoc did not slack,"
10631,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Till a feeble cheer the Dane
10632,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,To our cheering sent us back;--
10633,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Their shots along the deep slowly boom:--
10634,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"Then ceased--and all is wail,"
10635,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,As they strike the shatter'd sail;
10636,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Or in conflagration pale
10637,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Light the gloom.
10638,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,
10639,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Out spoke the victor then
10640,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"As he hail'd them o'er the wave,"
10641,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,'Ye are brothers! ye are men!
10642,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,And we conquer but to save:--
10643,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,So peace instead of death let us bring:
10644,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"But yield, proud foe, thy fleet"
10645,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"With the crews, at England's feet,"
10646,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,And make submission meet
10647,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,To our King.'
10648,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,
10649,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Then Denmark bless'd our chief
10650,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,That he gave her wounds repose;
10651,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,And the sounds of joy and grief
10652,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"From her people wildly rose,"
10653,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,As death withdrew his shades from the day:
10654,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,While the sun look'd smiling bright
10655,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"O'er a wide and woeful sight,"
10656,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Where the fires of funeral light
10657,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Died away.
10658,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,
10659,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"Now joy, old England, raise!"
10660,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"For the tidings of thy might,"
10661,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"By the festal cities' blaze,"
10662,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,Whilst the wine-cup shines in light;

12134,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,"He knows it not, he cannot guess;"

12161,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,
12162,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Perhaps some dungeon hears thee groan
12163,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,"Maim'd, mangled by inhuman men;"
12164,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Or thou upon a desert thrown
12165,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Inheritest the lion's den;
12166,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Or hast been summon'd to the deep
12167,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,"Thou, thou, and all thy mates, to keep"

12169,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,
12170,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,I look for ghosts: but none will force

12172,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,That there was ever intercourse
12173,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Between the living and the dead;
12174,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,For surely then I should have sight

12177,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,
12178,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,My apprehensions come in crowds;
12179,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,I dread the rustling of the grass;
12180,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,The very shadows of the clouds
12181,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Have power to shake me as they pass:
12182,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,"I question things, and do not find"
12183,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,One that will answer to my mind;
12184,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,And all the world appears unkind.
12185,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,
12186,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,Beyond participation lie
12187,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,"My troubles, and beyond relief:"
12188,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,If any chance to heave a sigh
12189,_THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET_,"They pity me, and not my grief."

13154,_ODE TO WINTER_,"_Germany, December, 1800_"
13155,_ODE TO WINTER_,
13156,_ODE TO WINTER_,When first the fiery-mantled Sun
13157,_ODE TO WINTER_,"His heavenly race began to run,"
13158,_ODE TO WINTER_,Round the earth and ocean blue
13159,_ODE TO WINTER_,His children four the Seasons flew.
13160,_ODE TO WINTER_,"First, in green apparel dancing,"
13161,_ODE TO WINTER_,The young Spring smiled with angel-grace;
13162,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Rosy Summer next advancing,"
13163,_ODE TO WINTER_,Rush'd into her sire's embrace--
13164,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Her bright-hair'd sire, who bade her keep"
13165,_ODE TO WINTER_,"For ever nearest to his smiles,"
13166,_ODE TO WINTER_,On Calpe's olive-shaded steep
13167,_ODE TO WINTER_,Or India's citron-cover'd isles:
13168,_ODE TO WINTER_,"More remote, and buxom-brown,"
13169,_ODE TO WINTER_,The Queen of vintage bow'd before his throne;
13170,_ODE TO WINTER_,"A rich pomegranate gemm'd her crown,"
13171,_ODE TO WINTER_,A ripe sheaf bound her zone.
13172,_ODE TO WINTER_,
13173,_ODE TO WINTER_,But howling Winter fled afar
13174,_ODE TO WINTER_,To hills that prop the polar star;
13175,_ODE TO WINTER_,And loves on deer-borne car to ride
13176,_ODE TO WINTER_,"With barren darkness by his side,"
13177,_ODE TO WINTER_,Round the shore where loud Lofoden
13178,_ODE TO WINTER_,Whirls to death the roaring whale;
13179,_ODE TO WINTER_,Round the hall where Runic Odin
13180,_ODE TO WINTER_,Howls his war-song to the gale;
13181,_ODE TO WINTER_,Save when adown the ravaged globe
13182,_ODE TO WINTER_,"He travels on his native storm,"
13183,_ODE TO WINTER_,Deflowering Nature's grassy robe
13184,_ODE TO WINTER_,And trampling on her faded form:--
13185,_ODE TO WINTER_,Till light's returning Lord assume
13186,_ODE TO WINTER_,"The shaft that drives him to his polar field,"
13187,_ODE TO WINTER_,Of power to pierce his raven plume
13188,_ODE TO WINTER_,And crystal-cover'd shield.
13189,_ODE TO WINTER_,
13190,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Oh, sire of storms! whose savage ear"
13191,_ODE TO WINTER_,"The Lapland drum delights to hear,"
13192,_ODE TO WINTER_,When Frenzy with her blood-shot eye
13193,_ODE TO WINTER_,Implores thy dreadful deity--
13194,_ODE TO WINTER_,Archangel! Power of desolation!
13195,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Fast descending as thou art,"
13196,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Say, hath mortal invocation"
13197,_ODE TO WINTER_,Spells to touch thy stony heart?
13198,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Then, sullen Winter! hear my prayer,"
13199,_ODE TO WINTER_,And gently rule the ruin'd year;
13200,_ODE TO WINTER_,Nor chill the wanderer's bosom bare
13201,_ODE TO WINTER_,Nor freeze the wretch's falling tear:
13202,_ODE TO WINTER_,To shuddering Want's unmantled bed
13203,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Thy horror-breathing agues cease to lend,"
13204,_ODE TO WINTER_,And gently on the orphan head
13205,_ODE TO WINTER_,Of Innocence descend.
13206,_ODE TO WINTER_,
13207,_ODE TO WINTER_,"But chiefly spare, O king of clouds!"
13208,_ODE TO WINTER_,"The sailor on his airy shrouds,"
13209,_ODE TO WINTER_,"When wrecks and beacons strew the steep,"
13210,_ODE TO WINTER_,And spectres walk along the deep.
13211,_ODE TO WINTER_,Milder yet thy snowy breezes
13212,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Pour on yonder tented shores,"
13213,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Where the Rhine's broad billow freezes,"
13214,_ODE TO WINTER_,Or the dark-brown Danube roars.
13215,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Oh, winds of Winter! list ye there"
13216,_ODE TO WINTER_,To many a deep and dying groan?
13217,_ODE TO WINTER_,"Or start, ye demons of the midnight air,"
13218,_ODE TO WINTER_,At shrieks and thunders louder than your own?
13219,_ODE TO WINTER_,Alas! ev'n your unhallow'd breath
13220,_ODE TO WINTER_,May spare the victim fallen low;
13221,_ODE TO WINTER_,"But Man will ask no truce to death,--"
13222,_ODE TO WINTER_,No bounds to human woe.

13233,_YARROW UNVISITED_,From Stirling Castle we had seen
13234,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"The mazy Forth unravell'd,"
13235,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Had trod the banks of Clyde and Tay,"
13236,_YARROW UNVISITED_,And with the Tweed had travell'd;
13237,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"And when we came to Clovenford,"
13238,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Then said my 'winsome Marrow,'"
13239,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"'Whate'er betide, we'll turn aside,"
13240,_YARROW UNVISITED_,And see the Braes of Yarrow.'
13241,_YARROW UNVISITED_,
13242,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"'Let Yarrow folk, frae Selkirk town,"
13243,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Who have been buying, selling,"
13244,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Go back to Yarrow, 'tis their own,"
13245,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Each maiden to her dwelling!
13246,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"On Yarrow's banks let herons feed,"
13247,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Hares couch, and rabbits burrow;"
13248,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"But we will downward with the Tweed,"
13249,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Nor turn aside to Yarrow.
13250,_YARROW UNVISITED_,
13251,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"'There's Gala Water, Leader Haughs,"
13252,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Both lying right before us;
13253,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"And Dryburgh, where with chiming Tweed"
13254,_YARROW UNVISITED_,The lintwhites sing in chorus;
13255,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"There's pleasant Tiviot-dale, a land"
13256,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Made blithe with plough and harrow:
13257,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Why throw away a needful day
13258,_YARROW UNVISITED_,To go in search of Yarrow?
13259,_YARROW UNVISITED_,
13260,_YARROW UNVISITED_,'What's Yarrow but a river bare
13261,_YARROW UNVISITED_,That glides the dark hills under?
13262,_YARROW UNVISITED_,There are a thousand such elsewhere
13263,_YARROW UNVISITED_,As worthy of your wonder.'
13264,_YARROW UNVISITED_,--Strange words they seem'd of slight and scorn;
13265,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"My True-love sigh'd for sorrow,"
13266,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"And look'd me in the face, to think"
13267,_YARROW UNVISITED_,I thus could speak of Yarrow!
13268,_YARROW UNVISITED_,
13269,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"'O green,' said I, 'are Yarrow's holms,"
13270,_YARROW UNVISITED_,And sweet is Yarrow flowing!
13271,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,"
13272,_YARROW UNVISITED_,But we will leave it growing.
13273,_YARROW UNVISITED_,O'er hilly path and open strath
13274,_YARROW UNVISITED_,We'll wander Scotland thorough;
13275,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"But, though so near, we will not turn"
13276,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Into the dale of Yarrow.

13282,_YARROW UNVISITED_,We will not see them; will not go
13283,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"To-day, nor yet to-morrow;"
13284,_YARROW UNVISITED_,Enough if in our hearts we know
13285,_YARROW UNVISITED_,There's such a place as Yarrow.
13286,_YARROW UNVISITED_,
13287,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"'Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!"

13291,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"The treasured dreams of times long past,"
13292,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"We'll keep them, winsome Marrow!"
13293,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"For when we're there, although 'tis fair,"
13294,_YARROW UNVISITED_,'Twill be another Yarrow!

13298,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Should we be loth to stir from home,"
13299,_YARROW UNVISITED_,And yet be melancholy;
13300,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"Should life be dull, and spirits low,"
13301,_YARROW UNVISITED_,'Twill soothe us in our sorrow

13313,_YARROW VISITED_,
13314,_YARROW VISITED_,And is this--Yarrow?--This the stream
13315,_YARROW VISITED_,Of which my fancy cherish'd
13316,_YARROW VISITED_,"So faithfully, a waking dream,"
13317,_YARROW VISITED_,An image that hath perish'd?
13318,_YARROW VISITED_,O that some minstrel's harp were near
13319,_YARROW VISITED_,To utter notes of gladness
13320,_YARROW VISITED_,"And chase this silence from the air,"
13321,_YARROW VISITED_,That fills my heart with sadness!
13322,_YARROW VISITED_,
13323,_YARROW VISITED_,Yet why?--a silvery current flows
13324,_YARROW VISITED_,With uncontroll'd meanderings;
13325,_YARROW VISITED_,Nor have these eyes by greener hills
13326,_YARROW VISITED_,"Been soothed, in all my wanderings."
13327,_YARROW VISITED_,"And, through her depths, Saint Mary's Lake"
13328,_YARROW VISITED_,Is visibly delighted;
13329,_YARROW VISITED_,For not a feature of those hills
13330,_YARROW VISITED_,Is in the mirror slighted.
13331,_YARROW VISITED_,
13332,_YARROW VISITED_,"A blue sky bends o'er Yarrow Vale,"
13333,_YARROW VISITED_,Save where that pearly whiteness
13334,_YARROW VISITED_,"Is round the rising sun diffused,"
13335,_YARROW VISITED_,A tender hazy brightness;
13336,_YARROW VISITED_,Mild dawn of promise! that excludes
13337,_YARROW VISITED_,All profitless dejection;
13338,_YARROW VISITED_,Though not unwilling here to admit
13339,_YARROW VISITED_,A pensive recollection.
13340,_YARROW VISITED_,
13341,_YARROW VISITED_,Where was it that the famous Flower
13342,_YARROW VISITED_,Of Yarrow Vale lay bleeding?
13343,_YARROW VISITED_,His bed perchance was yon smooth mound
13344,_YARROW VISITED_,On which the herd is feeding:
13345,_YARROW VISITED_,"And haply from this crystal pool,"
13346,_YARROW VISITED_,"Now peaceful as the morning,"
13347,_YARROW VISITED_,"The Water-wraith ascended thrice,"
13348,_YARROW VISITED_,And gave his doleful warning.
13349,_YARROW VISITED_,
13350,_YARROW VISITED_,Delicious is the lay that sings
13351,_YARROW VISITED_,"The haunts of happy lovers,"
13352,_YARROW VISITED_,"The path that leads them to the grove,"
13353,_YARROW VISITED_,The leafy grove that covers:
13354,_YARROW VISITED_,And pity sanctifies the verse
13355,_YARROW VISITED_,"That paints, by strength of sorrow,"
13356,_YARROW VISITED_,The unconquerable strength of love;
13357,_YARROW VISITED_,"Bear witness, rueful Yarrow!"
13358,_YARROW VISITED_,
13359,_YARROW VISITED_,But thou that didst appear so fair
13360,_YARROW VISITED_,"To fond imagination,"
13361,_YARROW VISITED_,Dost rival in the light of day
13362,_YARROW VISITED_,Her delicate creation:
13363,_YARROW VISITED_,"Meek loveliness is round thee spread,"
13364,_YARROW VISITED_,A softness still and holy:
13365,_YARROW VISITED_,"The grace of forest charms decay'd,"
13366,_YARROW VISITED_,And pastoral melancholy.
13367,_YARROW VISITED_,
13368,_YARROW VISITED_,"That region left, the vale unfolds"
13369,_YARROW VISITED_,"Rich groves of lofty stature,"
13370,_YARROW VISITED_,With Yarrow winding through the pomp
13371,_YARROW VISITED_,Of cultivated nature;
13372,_YARROW VISITED_,And rising from those lofty groves
13373,_YARROW VISITED_,"Behold a ruin hoary,"
13374,_YARROW VISITED_,"The shatter'd front of Newark's towers,"
13375,_YARROW VISITED_,Renown'd in Border story.
13376,_YARROW VISITED_,
13377,_YARROW VISITED_,"Fair scenes for childhood's opening bloom,"
13378,_YARROW VISITED_,"For sportive youth to stray in,"
13379,_YARROW VISITED_,"For manhood to enjoy his strength,"
13380,_YARROW VISITED_,And age to wear away in!
13381,_YARROW VISITED_,"Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,"
13382,_YARROW VISITED_,A covert for protection
13383,_YARROW VISITED_,Of tender thoughts that nestle there--
13384,_YARROW VISITED_,The brood of chaste affection.
13385,_YARROW VISITED_,
13386,_YARROW VISITED_,How sweet on this autumnal day
13387,_YARROW VISITED_,"The wild-wood fruits to gather,"
13388,_YARROW VISITED_,And on my True-love's forehead plant
13389,_YARROW VISITED_,A crest of blooming heather!
13390,_YARROW VISITED_,And what if I enwreathed my own?
13391,_YARROW VISITED_,'Twere no offence to reason;
13392,_YARROW VISITED_,The sober hills thus deck their brows
13393,_YARROW VISITED_,To meet the wintry season.
13394,_YARROW VISITED_,
13395,_YARROW VISITED_,"I see--but not by sight alone,"
13396,_YARROW VISITED_,"Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;"
13397,_YARROW VISITED_,A ray of Fancy still survives--
13398,_YARROW VISITED_,Her sunshine plays upon thee!
13399,_YARROW VISITED_,Thy ever-youthful waters keep
13400,_YARROW VISITED_,A course of lively pleasure;
13401,_YARROW VISITED_,And gladsome notes my lips can breathe
13402,_YARROW VISITED_,Accordant to the measure.
13403,_YARROW VISITED_,
13404,_YARROW VISITED_,"The vapours linger round the heights,"
13405,_YARROW VISITED_,"They melt, and soon must vanish;"
13406,_YARROW VISITED_,"One hour is theirs, nor more is mine--"
13407,_YARROW VISITED_,"Sad thought! which I would banish,"
13408,_YARROW VISITED_,"But that I know, where'er I go,"
13409,_YARROW VISITED_,"Thy genuine image, Yarrow!"
13410,_YARROW VISITED_,"Will dwell with me, to heighten joy,"
13411,_YARROW VISITED_,And cheer my mind in sorrow.

13431,_THE INVITATION_,"It kiss'd the forehead of the earth,"
13432,_THE INVITATION_,"And smiled upon the silent sea,"
13433,_THE INVITATION_,"And bade the frozen streams be free,"
13434,_THE INVITATION_,"And waked to music all their fountains,"
13435,_THE INVITATION_,"And breathed upon the frozen mountains,"

13441,_THE INVITATION_,"Away, away, from men and towns,"

13443,_THE INVITATION_,To the silent wilderness

13445,_THE INVITATION_,"Its music, lest it should not find"
13446,_THE INVITATION_,"An echo in another's mind,"

13454,_THE INVITATION_,"Image all their roof of leaves,"
13455,_THE INVITATION_,Where the pine its garland weaves
13456,_THE INVITATION_,"Of sapless green, and ivy dun,"
13457,_THE INVITATION_,Round stems that never kiss the sun;
13458,_THE INVITATION_,Where the lawns and pastures be
13459,_THE INVITATION_,And the sandhills of the sea;
13460,_THE INVITATION_,Where the melting hoar-frost wets
13461,_THE INVITATION_,"The daisy-star that never sets,"
13462,_THE INVITATION_,And wind-flowers and violets
13463,_THE INVITATION_,Which yet join not scent to hue
13464,_THE INVITATION_,Crown the pale year weak and new;
13465,_THE INVITATION_,When the night is left behind
13466,_THE INVITATION_,"In the deep east, dim and blind,"
13467,_THE INVITATION_,"And the blue noon is over us,"
13468,_THE INVITATION_,And the multitudinous
13469,_THE INVITATION_,"Billows murmur at our feet,"
13470,_THE INVITATION_,"Where the earth and ocean meet,"
13471,_THE INVITATION_,And all things seem only one

13489,_THE RECOLLECTION_,
13490,_THE RECOLLECTION_,We wander'd to the Pine Forest

13494,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"The whispering waves were half asleep,"

13503,_THE RECOLLECTION_,We paused amid the pines that stood
13504,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"The giants of the waste,"
13505,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Tortured by storms to shapes as rude
13506,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"As serpents interlaced,--"

13508,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"That under heaven is blown,"
13509,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"To harmonies and hues beneath,"
13510,_THE RECOLLECTION_,As tender as its own:

13513,_THE RECOLLECTION_,As still as in the silent deep
13514,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The ocean-woods may be.
13515,_THE RECOLLECTION_,
13516,_THE RECOLLECTION_,How calm it was!--The silence there
13517,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"By such a chain was bound,"
13518,_THE RECOLLECTION_,That even the busy woodpecker
13519,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Made stiller with her sound
13520,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The inviolable quietness;
13521,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The breath of peace we drew
13522,_THE RECOLLECTION_,With its soft motion made not less
13523,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The calm that round us grew.
13524,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"There seem'd, from the remotest seat"
13525,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Of the white mountain waste
13526,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"To the soft flower beneath our feet,"
13527,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"A magic circle traced,--"
13528,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"A spirit interfused around,"
13529,_THE RECOLLECTION_,A thrilling silent life;
13530,_THE RECOLLECTION_,To momentary peace it bound
13531,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Our mortal nature's strife;--
13532,_THE RECOLLECTION_,And still I felt the centre of
13533,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The magic circle there
13534,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Was one fair form that fill'd with love
13535,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The lifeless atmosphere.
13536,_THE RECOLLECTION_,
13537,_THE RECOLLECTION_,We paused beside the pools that lie
13538,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Under the forest bough;
13539,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Each seem'd as 'twere a little sky
13540,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Gulf'd in a world below;
13541,_THE RECOLLECTION_,A firmament of purple light

13919,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"With a still, mysterious stealth:"

13921,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Like three fit wines in a cup,"
13922,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,And thou shalt quaff it:--thou shalt hear
13923,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Distant harvest-carols clear;
13924,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Rustle of the reapéd corn;
13925,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Sweet birds antheming the morn:
13926,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"And, in the same moment--hark!"
13927,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"'Tis the early April lark,"
13928,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Or the rooks, with busy caw,"
13929,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Foraging for sticks and straw.
13930,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Thou shalt, at one glance, behold"

13936,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"And every leaf, and every flower"
13937,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Pearléd with the self-same shower.
13938,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
13939,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Meagre from its celléd sleep;
13940,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,And the snake all winter-thin

13942,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see
13943,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Hatching in the hawthorn-tree,"
13944,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,When the hen-bird's wing doth rest
13945,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Quiet on her mossy nest;
13946,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Then the hurry and alarm
13947,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,When the bee-hive casts its swarm;
13948,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Acorns ripe down-pattering,"
13949,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,While the autumn breezes sing.
13950,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,
13951,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose;"
13952,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Everything is spoilt by use:
13953,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Where's the cheek that doth not fade,"
13954,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Too much gazed at? Where's the maid
13955,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Whose lip mature is ever new?
13956,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Where's the eye, however blue,"
13957,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Doth not weary? Where's the face

13959,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Where's the voice, however soft,"
13960,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,One would hear so very oft?
13961,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth
13962,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Like to bubbles when rain pelteth.
13963,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Let then wingéd Fancy find
13964,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Thee a mistress to thy mind:
13965,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Dulcet-eyed as Ceres' daughter,"
13966,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,Ere the God of Torment taught her
13967,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,How to frown and how to chide;
13968,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,With a waist and with a side
13969,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"White as Hebe's, when her zone"
13970,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Slipt its golden clasp, and down"
13971,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Fell her kirtle to her feet,"
13972,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"While she held the goblet sweet,"
13973,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,And Jove grew languid.--Break the mesh

13975,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,"Quickly break her prison-string,"
13976,_THE REALM OF FANCY_,And such joys as these she'll bring.

13986,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,
13987,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,I heard a thousand blended notes
13988,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,"While in a grove I sate reclined,"
13989,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
13990,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
13991,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,
13992,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,To her fair works did Nature link
13993,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,The human soul that through me ran;
13994,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,And much it grieved my heart to think
13995,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,What Man has made of Man.
13996,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,
13997,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,"Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,"
13998,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;

14001,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,
14002,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,"The birds around me hopp'd and play'd,"
14003,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,"Their thoughts I cannot measure,--"
14004,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,But the least motion which they made
14005,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,It seem'd a thrill of pleasure.
14006,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,
14007,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,The budding twigs spread out their fan
14008,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,To catch the breezy air;
14009,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,"And I must think, do all I can,"
14010,_WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING_,That there was pleasure there.

14038,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Beneath her father's roof, alone"

14045,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,There came a youth from Georgia's shore--
14046,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,A military casque he wore
14047,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,With splendid feathers drest;
14048,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,He brought them from the Cherokees;
14049,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The feathers nodded in the breeze
14050,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And made a gallant crest.
14051,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14052,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,From Indian blood you deem him sprung:
14053,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,But no! he spake the English tongue

14056,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"From battle and from jeopardy,"
14057,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,He 'cross the ocean came.

14059,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"With hues of genius on his cheek,"
14060,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,In finest tones the youth could speak:

14062,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"The moon, the glory of the sun,"
14063,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And streams that murmur as they run
14064,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Had been his dearest joy.
14065,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14066,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,He was a lovely youth! I guess
14067,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The panther in the wilderness
14068,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Was not so fair as he;
14069,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"And when he chose to sport and play,"
14070,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,No dolphin ever was so gay
14071,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Upon the tropic sea.
14072,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14073,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Among the Indians he had fought;
14074,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And with him many tales he brought

14076,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Such tales as, told to any maid"
14077,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"By such a youth, in the green shade,"

14080,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"He told of girls, a happy rout!"

14082,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Their pleasant Indian town,"
14083,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,To gather strawberries all day long;
14084,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Returning with a choral song
14085,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,When daylight is gone down.
14086,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14087,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,He spake of plants that hourly change
14088,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Their blossoms, through a boundless range"
14089,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Of intermingling hues;
14090,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"With budding, fading, faded flowers,"
14091,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,They stand the wonder of the bowers
14092,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,From morn to evening dews.
14093,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,

14096,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The cypress and her spire;
14097,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,--Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam

14100,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14101,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"The youth of green savannahs spake,"

14103,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,With all its fairy crowds
14104,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Of islands, that together lie"
14105,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,As quietly as spots of sky
14106,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Among the evening clouds.
14107,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14108,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"'How pleasant,' then he said, 'it were"

14110,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,In sunshine or in shade
14111,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"To wander with an easy mind,"
14112,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"And build a household fire, and find"
14113,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,A home in every glade!
14114,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14115,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,'What days and what bright years! Ah me!
14116,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Our life were life indeed, with thee"

14120,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,On such an earth as this!'
14121,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14122,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And then he sometimes interwove

14132,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Or run, my own adopted bride,"
14133,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"A sylvan huntress at my side,"

14141,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And drive the flying deer.
14142,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14143,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"'And now, as fitting is and right,"
14144,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"We in the church our faith will plight,"
14145,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,A husband and a wife.'
14146,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Even so they did; and I may say
14147,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,That to sweet Ruth that happy day
14148,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Was more than human life.
14149,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14150,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Through dream and vision did she sink,"

14164,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"The wind, the tempest roaring high,"

14178,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Nor less, to feed voluptuous thought,"

14198,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14199,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,His genius and his moral frame

14201,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The slave of low desires:
14202,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,A man who without self-control
14203,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Would seek what the degraded soul
14204,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Unworthily admires.
14205,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14206,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And yet he with no feign'd delight
14207,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Had woo'd the maiden, day and night"
14208,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Had loved her, night and morn:"
14209,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,What could he less than love a maid

14211,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,So kind and so forlorn?
14212,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14213,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Sometimes most earnestly he said,"
14214,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,'O Ruth! I have been worse than dead;

14219,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,

14224,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And seem'd as if let loose from chains
14225,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,To live at liberty!
14226,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14227,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"'No more of this--for now, by thee,"

14233,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14234,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Full soon that better mind was gone;
14235,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"No hope, no wish remain'd, not one,--"

14237,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"New objects did new pleasure give,"
14238,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And once again he wish'd to live
14239,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,As lawless as before.
14240,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14241,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Meanwhile, as thus with him it fared,"
14242,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"They for the voyage were prepared,"

14250,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And in a prison housed;

14252,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Made of wild words, her cup of wrong"
14253,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,She fearfully caroused.
14254,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14255,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Yet sometimes milder hours she knew,"
14256,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Nor wanted sun, nor rain, nor dew,"
14257,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Nor pastimes of the May,"
14258,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,--They all were with her in her cell;
14259,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And a clear brook with cheerful knell
14260,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Did o'er the pebbles play.
14261,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14262,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"When Ruth three seasons thus had lain,"
14263,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,There came a respite to her pain;
14264,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,She from her prison fled;
14265,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,But of the Vagrant none took thought;
14266,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And where it liked her best she sought
14267,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Her shelter and her bread.
14268,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14269,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Among the fields she breathed again:
14270,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The master-current of her brain
14271,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Ran permanent and free;
14272,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"And, coming to the banks of Tone,"
14273,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,There did she rest; and dwell alone
14274,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Under the greenwood tree.
14275,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14276,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"The engines of her pain, the tools"

14278,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And airs that gently stir

14280,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Nor ever tax'd them with the ill
14281,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Which had been done to her.
14282,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14283,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,A barn her Winter bed supplies;

14286,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,(And all do in this tale agree)
14287,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree,"
14288,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,And other home hath none.
14289,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14290,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"An innocent life, yet far astray!"

14293,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Sore aches she needs must have! but less
14294,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Of mind, than body's wretchedness,"

14296,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14297,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,If she is prest by want of food

14301,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Where up and down with easy pace
14302,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The horsemen-travellers ride.
14303,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14304,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,That oaten pipe of hers is mute
14305,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Or thrown away: but with a flute
14306,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Her loneliness she cheers;
14307,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"This flute, made of a hemlock stalk,"
14308,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,At evening in his homeward walk
14309,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,The Quantock woodman hears.
14310,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14311,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"I, too, have pass'd her on the hills"
14312,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Setting her little water-mills
14313,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,By spouts and fountains wild--
14314,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Such small machinery as she turn'd
14315,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Ere she had wept, ere she had mourn'd,--"
14316,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,A young and happy child!
14317,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,
14318,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,"Farewell! and when thy days are told,"
14319,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Ill-fated Ruth! in hallow'd mould
14320,_RUTH: OR THE INFLUENCES OF NATURE_,Thy corpse shall buried be;

15351,CHILDHOOD_,Shaped by himself with newly-learnéd art;
15352,CHILDHOOD_,"A wedding or a festival,"
15353,CHILDHOOD_,A mourning or a funeral;
15354,CHILDHOOD_,"And this hath now his heart,"
15355,CHILDHOOD_,And unto this he frames his song:
15356,CHILDHOOD_,Then will he fit his tongue

15364,CHILDHOOD_,That life brings with her in her equipage;
15365,CHILDHOOD_,As if his whole vocation

15378,CHILDHOOD_,"Thou, over whom thy Immortality"
15379,CHILDHOOD_,"Broods like the day, a master o'er a slave,"
15380,CHILDHOOD_,A Presence which is not to be put by;

15389,CHILDHOOD_,
15390,CHILDHOOD_,O joy! that in our embers
15391,CHILDHOOD_,"Is something that doth live,"
15392,CHILDHOOD_,That Nature yet remembers
15393,CHILDHOOD_,What was so fugitive!
15394,CHILDHOOD_,The thought of our past years in me doth breed

15402,CHILDHOOD_,But for those obstinate questionings
15403,CHILDHOOD_,"Of sense and outward things,"
15404,CHILDHOOD_,"Fallings from us, vanishings;"
15405,CHILDHOOD_,Blank misgivings of a creature
15406,CHILDHOOD_,"Moving about in worlds not realized,"
15407,CHILDHOOD_,"High instincts, before which our mortal nature"
15408,CHILDHOOD_,Did tremble like a guilty thing surprized:
15409,CHILDHOOD_,"But for those first affections,"
15410,CHILDHOOD_,"Those shadowy recollections,"
15411,CHILDHOOD_,"Which, be they what they may,"
15412,CHILDHOOD_,"Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,"
15413,CHILDHOOD_,Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
15414,CHILDHOOD_,"Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make"
15415,CHILDHOOD_,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
15416,CHILDHOOD_,"Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,"

15419,CHILDHOOD_,Nor man nor boy
15420,CHILDHOOD_,"Nor all that is at enmity with joy,"
15421,CHILDHOOD_,Can utterly abolish or destroy!
15422,CHILDHOOD_,"Hence, in a season of calm weather"
15423,CHILDHOOD_,"Though inland far we be,"
15424,CHILDHOOD_,Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
15425,CHILDHOOD_,Which brought us hither;
15426,CHILDHOOD_,Can in a moment travel thither--
15427,CHILDHOOD_,"And see the children sport upon the shore,"
15428,CHILDHOOD_,And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
15429,CHILDHOOD_,
15430,CHILDHOOD_,"Then, sing ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!"

15438,CHILDHOOD_,"Be now for ever taken from my sight,"

15440,CHILDHOOD_,"Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;"

15446,CHILDHOOD_,Out of human suffering;

15454,CHILDHOOD_,To live beneath your more habitual sway:
15455,CHILDHOOD_,I love the brooks which down their channels fret
15456,CHILDHOOD_,Even more than when I tripp'd lightly as they;
15457,CHILDHOOD_,The innocent brightness of a new-born day
15458,CHILDHOOD_,Is lovely yet;
15459,CHILDHOOD_,The clouds that gather round the setting sun
15460,CHILDHOOD_,Do take a sober colouring from an eye

15506,NOTES,_Summary of Book First_
15507,NOTES,
15508,NOTES,
15509,NOTES,"The Elizabethan Poetry, as it is rather vaguely termed, forms the"
15510,NOTES,"substance of this Book, which contains pieces from Wyat under Henry"
15511,NOTES,"VIII to Shakespeare midway through the reign of James I, and Drummond"
15512,NOTES,who carried on the early manner to a still later period. There is here
15513,NOTES,a wide range of style;--from simplicity expressed in a language hardly
15514,NOTES,"yet broken-in to verse,--through the pastoral fancies and Italian"
15515,NOTES,"conceits of the strictly Elizabethan time,--to the passionate reality"
15516,NOTES,of Shakespeare: yet a general uniformity of tone prevails. Few readers
15517,NOTES,"can fail to observe the natural sweetness of the verse, the"
15518,NOTES,"single-hearted straightforwardness of the thoughts:--nor less, the"
15519,NOTES,"limitation of subject to the many phases of one passion, which then"
15520,NOTES,"characterized our lyrical poetry,--unless when, as in especial with"
15521,NOTES,"Shakespeare, the 'purple light of Love' is tempered by a spirit of"
15522,NOTES,"sterner reflection. For the didactic verse of the century, although"
15523,NOTES,"lyrical in form, yet very rarely rises to the pervading emotion, the"
15524,NOTES,"golden cadence, proper to the lyric."
15525,NOTES,
15526,NOTES,It should be observed that this and the following Summaries apply in
15527,NOTES,"the main to the Collection here presented, in which (besides its"
15528,NOTES,restriction to Lyrical Poetry) a strictly representative or historical
15529,NOTES,"Anthology has not been aimed at. Great excellence, in human art as in"
15530,NOTES,"human character, has from the beginning of things been even more"
15531,NOTES,"uniform than mediocrity, by virtue of the closeness of its approach to"
15532,NOTES,Nature:--and so far as the standard of Excellence kept in view has
15533,NOTES,"been attained in this volume, a comparative absence of extreme or"
15534,NOTES,"temporary phases in style, a similarity of tone and manner, will be"
15535,NOTES,"found throughout:--something neither modern nor ancient, but true and"
15536,NOTES,speaking to the heart of man alike throughout all ages.

15583,PAGE NO.,"development of his genius. His great contemporary fame, second only,"
15584,PAGE NO.,"it appears, to Spenser's, has been hence obscured. At times he is"
15585,PAGE NO.,heavy and even prosaic; his simplicity is rude and bare; his verse

16075,PAGE NO.,
16076,PAGE NO.,It is more difficult to characterize the English Poetry of the
16077,PAGE NO.,Eighteenth century than that of any other. For it was an age not only
16078,PAGE NO.,"of spontaneous transition, but of bold experiment: it includes not"
16079,PAGE NO.,only such absolute contrasts as distinguish the 'Rape of the Lock'
16080,PAGE NO.,"from the 'Parish Register,' but such vast contemporaneous differences"
16081,PAGE NO.,"as lie between Pope and Collins, Burns and Cowper. Yet we may clearly"
16082,PAGE NO.,trace three leading moods or tendencies:--the aspects of courtly or
16083,PAGE NO.,educated life represented by Pope and carried to exhaustion by his
16084,PAGE NO.,"followers; the poetry of Nature and of Man, viewed through a"
16085,PAGE NO.,"cultivated, and at the same time an impassioned frame of mind by"
16086,PAGE NO.,"Collins and Gray:--lastly, the study of vivid and simple narrative,"
16087,PAGE NO.,"including natural description, begun by Gay and Thomson, pursued by"
16088,PAGE NO.,"Burns and others in the north, and established in England by"
16089,PAGE NO.,"Goldsmith, Percy, Crabbe, and Cowper. Great varieties in style"
16090,PAGE NO.,accompanied these diversities in aim: poets could not always
16091,PAGE NO.,distinguish the manner suitable for subjects so far apart: and the
16092,PAGE NO.,"union of conventional and of common language, exhibited most"
16093,PAGE NO.,"conspicuously by Burns, has given a tone to the poetry of that century"
16094,PAGE NO.,which is better explained by reference to its historical origin than
16095,PAGE NO.,"by naming it artificial. There is, again, a nobleness of thought, a"
16096,PAGE NO.,"courageous aim at high and, in a strict sense manly, excellence in"
16097,PAGE NO.,many of the writers:--nor can that period be justly termed tame and
16098,PAGE NO.,"wanting in originality, which produced poems such as Pope's Satires,"
16099,PAGE NO.,"Gray's Odes and Elegy, the ballads of Gay and Carey, the songs of"
16100,PAGE NO.,"Burns and Cowper. In truth Poetry at this, as at all times, was a more"
16101,PAGE NO.,or less unconscious mirror of the genius of the age: and the many
16102,PAGE NO.,complex causes which made the Eighteenth century the turning-time in
16103,PAGE NO.,modern European civilization are also more or less reflected in its
16104,PAGE NO.,verse. An intelligent reader will find the influence of Newton as
16105,PAGE NO.,"markedly in the poems of Pope, as of Elizabeth in the plays of"
16106,PAGE NO.,"Shakespeare. On this great subject, however, these indications must"
16107,PAGE NO.,here be sufficient.

16132,PAGE NO.,"Welsh poetry, that it is hard to discover whence Gray drew his Cymric"

16136,PAGE NO.,published till 1773; but the story seems to have passed in MS. to

16138,PAGE NO.,to _high-born Hoel_ and _soft Llewellyn_; to _Cadwallo_ and _Urien_;
16139,PAGE NO.,"may, similarly, have been derived from the 'Specimens' of early Welsh"
16140,PAGE NO.,"poetry, by the Rev. E. Evans:--as, although not published till 1764,"
16141,PAGE NO.,"the MS., we learn from a letter to Dr. Wharton, was in Gray's hands by"

16143,PAGE NO.,whether Gray (of whose acquaintance with Welsh we have no evidence)
16144,PAGE NO.,must not have been also aided by some Welsh scholar. He is one of the
16145,PAGE NO.,poets least likely to scatter epithets at random: 'soft' or gentle is
16146,PAGE NO.,the epithet emphatically and specially given to Llewelyn in
16147,PAGE NO.,"contemporary Welsh poetry, and is hence here used with particular"
16148,PAGE NO.,"propriety. Yet, without such assistance as we have suggested, Gray"

16336,PAGE NO.,"It proves sufficiently the lavish wealth of our own age in Poetry,"
16337,PAGE NO.,"that the pieces which, without conscious departure from the standard"
16338,PAGE NO.,"of Excellence, render this Book by far the longest, were with very few"
16339,PAGE NO.,exceptions composed during the first thirty years of the Nineteenth
16340,PAGE NO.,century. Exhaustive reasons can hardly be given for the strangely
16341,PAGE NO.,"sudden appearance of individual genius: that, however, which assigns"
16342,PAGE NO.,the splendid national achievements of our recent poetry to an impulse
16343,PAGE NO.,from the France of the first Republic and Empire is inadequate. The
16344,PAGE NO.,"first French Revolution was rather one result,--the most conspicuous,"
16345,PAGE NO.,"indeed, yet itself in great measure essentially retrogressive,--of"
16346,PAGE NO.,"that wider and more potent spirit which through enquiry and attempt,"
16347,PAGE NO.,"through strength and weakness, sweeps mankind round the circles (not,"
16348,PAGE NO.,"as some too confidently argue, of Advance, but) of gradual"
16349,PAGE NO.,Transformation: and it is to this that we must trace the literature of
16350,PAGE NO.,"Modern Europe. But, without attempting discussion on the motive causes"
16351,PAGE NO.,"of Scott, Wordsworth, Shelley, and others, we may observe that these"
16352,PAGE NO.,Poets carried to further perfection the later tendencies of the
16353,PAGE NO.,"Century preceding, in simplicity of narrative, reverence for human"
16354,PAGE NO.,"Passion and Character in every sphere, and love of Nature for"
16355,PAGE NO.,"herself:--that, whilst maintaining on the whole the advances in art"
16356,PAGE NO.,"made since the Restoration, they renewed the half-forgotten melody and"
16357,PAGE NO.,"depth of tone which marked the best Elizabethan writers:--that,"
16358,PAGE NO.,"lastly, to what was thus inherited they added a richness in language"
16359,PAGE NO.,"and a variety in metre, a force and fire in narrative, a tenderness"
16360,PAGE NO.,"and bloom in feeling, an insight into the finer passages of the Soul"
16361,PAGE NO.,"and the inner meanings of the landscape, a larger sense of"
16362,PAGE NO.,"Humanity,--hitherto scarcely attained, and perhaps unattainable even"
16363,PAGE NO.,"by predecessors of not inferior individual genius. In a word, the"
16364,PAGE NO.,"Nation which, after the Greeks in their glory, may fairly claim that"
16365,PAGE NO.,during six centuries it has proved itself the most richly gifted of
16366,PAGE NO.,"all nations for Poetry, expressed in these men the highest strength"
16367,PAGE NO.,and prodigality of its nature. They interpreted the age to
16368,PAGE NO.,itself--hence the many phases of thought and style they present:--to
16369,PAGE NO.,"sympathize with each, fervently and impartially, without fear and"
16370,PAGE NO.,"without fancifulness, is no doubtful step in the higher education of"
16371,PAGE NO.,the soul. For purity in taste is absolutely proportionate to
16372,PAGE NO.,strength--and when once the mind has raised itself to grasp and to
16373,PAGE NO.,"delight in excellence, those who love most will be found to love most"
16374,PAGE NO.,wisely.
