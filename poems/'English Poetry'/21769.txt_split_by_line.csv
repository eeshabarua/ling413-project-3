259,THE ARAB STEED,THE ARAB STEED
260,THE ARAB STEED,
261,THE ARAB STEED,"I gave the 'orse 'is evenin' feed,"
262,THE ARAB STEED,"And bedded of 'im down,"
263,THE ARAB STEED,And went to 'ear the sing-song
264,THE ARAB STEED,"In the bar-room of the Crown,"
265,THE ARAB STEED,And one young feller spoke a piece
266,THE ARAB STEED,"As told a kind of tale,"
267,THE ARAB STEED,About an Arab man wot 'ad
268,THE ARAB STEED,A certain 'orse for sale.
269,THE ARAB STEED,
270,THE ARAB STEED,I 'ave no grudge against the man &mdash;
271,THE ARAB STEED,"I never 'eard 'is name,"
272,THE ARAB STEED,But if he was my closest pal
273,THE ARAB STEED,"I'd say the very same,"
274,THE ARAB STEED,For wot you do in other things
275,THE ARAB STEED,"Is neither 'ere nor there,"
276,THE ARAB STEED,But w'en it comes to 'orses
277,THE ARAB STEED,You must keep upon the square.
278,THE ARAB STEED,
279,THE ARAB STEED,Now I'm tellin' you the story
280,THE ARAB STEED,"Just as it was told last night,"
281,THE ARAB STEED,And if I wrong this Arab man
282,THE ARAB STEED,Then 'e can set me right;
283,THE ARAB STEED,"But s'posin' all these fac's are fac's,"
284,THE ARAB STEED,Then I make bold to say
285,THE ARAB STEED,That I think it was not sportsmanlike
286,THE ARAB STEED,To act in sich a way.
287,THE ARAB STEED,
288,THE ARAB STEED,"For, as I understand the thing,"
289,THE ARAB STEED,'E went to sell this steed &mdash;
290,THE ARAB STEED,Which is a name they give a 'orse
291,THE ARAB STEED,"Of some outlandish breed &mdash;,"
292,THE ARAB STEED,"And soon 'e found a customer,"
293,THE ARAB STEED,"A proper sportin' gent,"
294,THE ARAB STEED,Who planked 'is money down at once
295,THE ARAB STEED,Without no argument.
296,THE ARAB STEED,
297,THE ARAB STEED,Now when the deal was finished
298,THE ARAB STEED,"And the money paid, you'd think"
299,THE ARAB STEED,This Arab would 'ave asked the gent
300,THE ARAB STEED,"At once to name 'is drink,"
301,THE ARAB STEED,"Or at least 'ave thanked 'im kindly,"
302,THE ARAB STEED,"An' wished 'im a good day,"
303,THE ARAB STEED,And own as 'e'd been treated
304,THE ARAB STEED,In a very 'andsome way.
305,THE ARAB STEED,
306,THE ARAB STEED,But instead o' this 'e started
307,THE ARAB STEED,"A-talkin' to the steed,"
308,THE ARAB STEED,"And speakin' of its ""braided mane"""
309,THE ARAB STEED,"An' of its ""winged speed,"""
310,THE ARAB STEED,And other sich expressions
311,THE ARAB STEED,"With which I can't agree,"
312,THE ARAB STEED,For a 'orse with wings an' braids an' things
313,THE ARAB STEED,Is not the 'orse for me.
314,THE ARAB STEED,
315,THE ARAB STEED,The moment that 'e 'ad the cash &mdash;
316,THE ARAB STEED,"Or wot 'e called the gold,"
317,THE ARAB STEED,'E turned as nasty as could be:
318,THE ARAB STEED,"Says 'e, ""You're sold!   You're sold!"""
319,THE ARAB STEED,Them was 'is words; it's not for me
320,THE ARAB STEED,To settle wot he meant;
321,THE ARAB STEED,"It may 'ave been the 'orse was sold,"
322,THE ARAB STEED,It may 'ave been the gent.
323,THE ARAB STEED,
324,THE ARAB STEED,I've not a word to say agin
325,THE ARAB STEED,"His fondness for 'is 'orse,"
326,THE ARAB STEED,But why should 'e insinivate
327,THE ARAB STEED,The gent would treat 'im worse?
328,THE ARAB STEED,An' why should 'e go talkin'
329,THE ARAB STEED,"In that aggravatin' way,"
330,THE ARAB STEED,As if the gent would gallop 'im
331,THE ARAB STEED,And wallop 'im all day?
332,THE ARAB STEED,
333,THE ARAB STEED,"It may 'ave been an' 'arness 'orse,"
334,THE ARAB STEED,"It may 'ave been an 'ack,"
335,THE ARAB STEED,"But a bargain is a bargain,"
336,THE ARAB STEED,An' there ain't no goin' back;
337,THE ARAB STEED,"For when you've picked the money up,"
338,THE ARAB STEED,"That finishes the deal,"
339,THE ARAB STEED,"And after that your mouth is shut,"
340,THE ARAB STEED,Wotever you may feel.
341,THE ARAB STEED,
342,THE ARAB STEED,Supposin' this 'ere Arab man
343,THE ARAB STEED,"'Ad wanted to be free,"
344,THE ARAB STEED,"'E could 'ave done it businesslike,"
345,THE ARAB STEED,The same as you or me;
346,THE ARAB STEED,"A fiver might 'ave squared the gent,"
347,THE ARAB STEED,An' then 'e could 'ave claimed
348,THE ARAB STEED,"As 'e'd cleared 'imself quite 'andsome,"
349,THE ARAB STEED,And no call to be ashamed.
350,THE ARAB STEED,
351,THE ARAB STEED,But instead 'o that this Arab man
352,THE ARAB STEED,"Went on from bad to worse,"
353,THE ARAB STEED,An' took an' chucked the money
354,THE ARAB STEED,At the cove wot bought the 'orse;
355,THE ARAB STEED,"'E'd 'ave learned 'im better manners,"
356,THE ARAB STEED,"If 'e'd waited there a bit,"
357,THE ARAB STEED,But 'e scooted on 'is bloomin' steed
358,THE ARAB STEED,As 'ard as 'e could split.
359,THE ARAB STEED,
360,THE ARAB STEED,"Per'aps 'e sold 'im after,"
361,THE ARAB STEED,"Or per'aps 'e 'ires 'im out,"
362,THE ARAB STEED,But I'd like to warm that Arab man
363,THE ARAB STEED,Wen next 'e comes about;
364,THE ARAB STEED,For wot 'e does in other things
365,THE ARAB STEED,"Is neither 'ere nor there,"
366,THE ARAB STEED,But w'en it comes to 'orses
367,THE ARAB STEED,We must keep 'im on the square.
368,THE ARAB STEED,

372,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST
373,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
374,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Peter Wilson, A.R.A.,"
375,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"In his small atelier,"
376,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Studied Continental Schools,"
377,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Drew by Academic rules.
378,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"So he made his bid for fame,"
379,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"But no golden answer came,"
380,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,For the fashion of his day
381,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Chanced to set the other way,"
382,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,And decadent forms of Art
383,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Drew the patrons of the mart.
384,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
385,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Now this poor reward of merit
386,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Rankled so in Peter's spirit,"
387,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,It was more than he could bear;
388,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,So one night in mad despair
389,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,He took his canvas for the year
390,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"(""Isle of Wight from Southsea Pier""),"
391,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"And he hurled it from his sight,"
392,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Hurled it blindly to the night,"
393,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Saw it fall diminuendo
394,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"From the open lattice window,"
395,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Till it landed with a flop
396,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"On the dust-bin's ashen top,"
397,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Where, 'mid damp and rain and grime,"
398,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,It remained till morning time.
399,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
400,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Then when morning brought reflection,"
401,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"He was shamed at his dejection,"
402,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,And he thought with consternation
403,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Of his poor, ill-used creation;"
404,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Down he rushed, and found it there"
405,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Lying all exposed and bare,"
406,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Mud-bespattered, spoiled, and botched,"
407,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Water sodden, fungus-blotched,"
408,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"All the outlines blurred and wavy,"
409,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"All the colours turned to gravy,"
410,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Fluids of a dappled hue,"
411,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Blues on red and reds on blue,"
412,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"A pea-green mother with her daughter,"
413,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Crazy boats on crazy water
414,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Steering out to who knows what,"
415,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,An island or a lobster-pot?
416,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
417,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Oh, the wretched man's despair!"
418,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Was it lost beyond repair?
419,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Swift he bore it from below,"
420,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Hastened to the studio,"
421,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Where with anxious eyes he studied
422,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"If the ruin, blotched and muddied,"
423,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Could by any human skill
424,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Be made a normal picture still.
425,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
426,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Thus in most repentant mood
427,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Unhappy Peter Wilson stood,"
428,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"When, with pompous face, self-centred,"
429,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Willoughby the critic entered &mdash;
430,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,He of whom it has been said
431,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,He lives a century ahead &mdash;
432,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,And sees with his prophetic eye
433,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"The forms which Time will justify,"
434,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,A fact which surely must abate
435,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,All longing to reincarnate.
436,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
437,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"""Ah, Wilson,"" said the famous man,"
438,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Turning himself the walls to scan,"
439,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"""The same old style of thing I trace,"
440,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Workmanlike but commonplace.
441,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Believe me, sir, the work that lives"
442,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,Must furnish more than Nature gives.
443,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"'The light that never was,' you know,"
444,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"That is your mark but here,   hullo!"
445,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,
446,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,What's this? What's this? Magnificent!
447,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"I've wronged you, Wilson! I repent!"
448,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,A masterpiece! A perfect thing!
449,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,What atmosphere! What colouring!
450,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"Spanish Armada, is it not?"
451,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,"A view of Ryde, no matter what,"
452,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,I pledge my critical renown
453,A POST-IMPRESSIONIST,That this will be the talk of Town.

1021,THE WANDERER {1},
1022,THE WANDERER {1},'Twas in the shadowy gloaming
1023,THE WANDERER {1},"Of a cold and wet March day,"
1024,THE WANDERER {1},That a wanderer came roaming
1025,THE WANDERER {1},From countries far away.
1026,THE WANDERER {1},
1027,THE WANDERER {1},"Scant raiment had he round him,"
1028,THE WANDERER {1},"Nor purse, nor worldly gear,"
1029,THE WANDERER {1},"Hungry and faint we found him,"
1030,THE WANDERER {1},And bade him welcome here.
1031,THE WANDERER {1},
1032,THE WANDERER {1},"His weary frame bent double,"
1033,THE WANDERER {1},"His eyes were old and dim,"
1034,THE WANDERER {1},His face was writhed with trouble
1035,THE WANDERER {1},Which none might share with him.
1036,THE WANDERER {1},
1037,THE WANDERER {1},"His speech was strange and broken,"
1038,THE WANDERER {1},"And none could understand,"
1039,THE WANDERER {1},Such words as might be spoken
1040,THE WANDERER {1},In some far distant land.
1041,THE WANDERER {1},
1042,THE WANDERER {1},"We guessed not whence he hailed from,"
1043,THE WANDERER {1},Nor knew what far-off quay
1044,THE WANDERER {1},His roving bark had sailed from
1045,THE WANDERER {1},Before he came to me.
1046,THE WANDERER {1},
1047,THE WANDERER {1},"But there he was, so slender,"
1048,THE WANDERER {1},"So helpless and so pale,"
1049,THE WANDERER {1},That my wife's heart grew tender
1050,THE WANDERER {1},For one who seemed so frail.
1051,THE WANDERER {1},
1052,THE WANDERER {1},"She cried, ""But you must bide here!"
1053,THE WANDERER {1},You shall no further roam.
1054,THE WANDERER {1},"Grow stronger by our side here,"
1055,THE WANDERER {1},"Within our moorland home!"""
1056,THE WANDERER {1},
1057,THE WANDERER {1},"She laid her best before him,"
1058,THE WANDERER {1},"Homely and simple fare,"
1059,THE WANDERER {1},And to his couch she bore him
1060,THE WANDERER {1},The raiment he should wear.
1061,THE WANDERER {1},
1062,THE WANDERER {1},"To mine he had been welcome,"
1063,THE WANDERER {1},"My suit of russet brown,"
1064,THE WANDERER {1},But she had dressed our weary guest
1065,THE WANDERER {1},In a loose and easy gown.
1066,THE WANDERER {1},
1067,THE WANDERER {1},"And long in peace he lay there,"
1068,THE WANDERER {1},"Brooding and still and weak,"
1069,THE WANDERER {1},Smiling from day to day there
1070,THE WANDERER {1},At thoughts he would not speak.
1071,THE WANDERER {1},
1072,THE WANDERER {1},"The months flowed on, but ever"
1073,THE WANDERER {1},"Our guest would still remain,"
1074,THE WANDERER {1},Nor made the least endeavour
1075,THE WANDERER {1},To leave our home again.
1076,THE WANDERER {1},
1077,THE WANDERER {1},"He heeded not for grammar,"
1078,THE WANDERER {1},"Nor did we care to teach,"
1079,THE WANDERER {1},But soon he learned to stammer
1080,THE WANDERER {1},Some words of English speech.
1081,THE WANDERER {1},
1082,THE WANDERER {1},With these our guest would tell us
1083,THE WANDERER {1},"The things that he liked best,"
1084,THE WANDERER {1},And order and compel us
1085,THE WANDERER {1},To follow his behest.
1086,THE WANDERER {1},
1087,THE WANDERER {1},"He ruled us without malice,"
1088,THE WANDERER {1},"But as if he owned us all,"
1089,THE WANDERER {1},A sultan in his palace
1090,THE WANDERER {1},With his servants at his call.
1091,THE WANDERER {1},
1092,THE WANDERER {1},"Those calls came fast and faster,"
1093,THE WANDERER {1},"Our service still we gave,"
1094,THE WANDERER {1},Till I who had been master
1095,THE WANDERER {1},Had grown to be his slave.
1096,THE WANDERER {1},
1097,THE WANDERER {1},He claimed with grasping gestures
1098,THE WANDERER {1},"Each thing of price he saw,"
1099,THE WANDERER {1},"Watches and rings and vestures,"
1100,THE WANDERER {1},His will the only law.
1101,THE WANDERER {1},
1102,THE WANDERER {1},"In vain had I commanded,"
1103,THE WANDERER {1},"In vain I struggled still,"
1104,THE WANDERER {1},Servants and wife were banded
1105,THE WANDERER {1},To do the stranger's will.
1106,THE WANDERER {1},
1107,THE WANDERER {1},And then in deep dejection
1108,THE WANDERER {1},"It came to me one day,"
1109,THE WANDERER {1},That my own wife's affection
1110,THE WANDERER {1},Had been beguiled away.
1111,THE WANDERER {1},
1112,THE WANDERER {1},"Our love had known no danger,"
1113,THE WANDERER {1},So certain had it been!
1114,THE WANDERER {1},And now to think a stranger
1115,THE WANDERER {1},Should dare to step between.
1116,THE WANDERER {1},
1117,THE WANDERER {1},I saw him lie and harken
1118,THE WANDERER {1},"To the little songs she sung,"
1119,THE WANDERER {1},And when the shadows darken
1120,THE WANDERER {1},I could hear his lisping tongue.
1121,THE WANDERER {1},
1122,THE WANDERER {1},"They would sit in chambers shady,"
1123,THE WANDERER {1},"When the light was growing dim,"
1124,THE WANDERER {1},"Ah, my fickle-hearted lady!"
1125,THE WANDERER {1},With your arm embracing him.
1126,THE WANDERER {1},
1127,THE WANDERER {1},"So, at last, lest he divide us,"
1128,THE WANDERER {1},I would put them to the test.
1129,THE WANDERER {1},"There was no one there beside us,"
1130,THE WANDERER {1},Save  this  interloping  guest.
1131,THE WANDERER {1},
1132,THE WANDERER {1},"So I took my stand before them,"
1133,THE WANDERER {1},"Very silent and erect,"
1134,THE WANDERER {1},"My accusing glance passed o'er them,"
1135,THE WANDERER {1},Though with no observed effect.
1136,THE WANDERER {1},
1137,THE WANDERER {1},"But the lamp light shone upon her,"
1138,THE WANDERER {1},"And I saw each tell-tale feature,"
1139,THE WANDERER {1},"As I cried, ""Now, on your honour,"
1140,THE WANDERER {1},"Do or don't you love the creature?"""
1141,THE WANDERER {1},
1142,THE WANDERER {1},"But her answer seemed evasive,"
1143,THE WANDERER {1},"It was ""Ducky-doodle-doo!"
1144,THE WANDERER {1},"If his mummy loves um babby,"
1145,THE WANDERER {1},"Doesn't daddums love um too?"""

1800,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"In the mean compass of a paltry town,"
1801,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,I could not in my youth have trimmed

1812,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"The meditative, philosophic plant"

1821,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Whose measured verse treads with as
1822,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,proud a gait

1824,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,they suck
1825,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,This honey that they stored?   Can you
1826,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,recite
1827,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,The vantages which each of these has had
1828,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,And I had not?   Or is the argument

1830,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,And covers in his wide-embracing self
1831,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,The stolen fame of twenty smaller men?
1832,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,You  prate  about  my  learning.   I
1833,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,would urge
1834,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,My want of learning rather as a proof

1840,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"That he, the ever-learned Verulam,"

1843,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"In their gross falseness prove that I am true,"
1844,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,And by that falseness gender truth in you.
1845,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,And what is left?   They say that they
1846,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,have found
1847,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"A script, wherein the writer tells my Lord"
1848,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,He is a secret poet.   True enough!
1849,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,But surely now that secret is o'er past.
1850,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Have you not read his poems?   Know
1851,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,you not
1852,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,That in our day a learned chancellor
1853,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Might better far dispense unjustest law
1854,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Than be suspect of such frivolity
1855,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,As lies in verse?   Therefore his poetry
1856,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Was secret.   Now that he is gone
1857,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"'Tis so no longer.   You may read his verse,"
1858,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,And judge if mine be better or be worse:
1859,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Read  and pronounce!   The  meed  of
1860,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,praise is thine;
1861,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,But still let his be his and mine be mine.
1862,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,I say no more; but how can you for-
1863,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,swear
1864,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"Outspoken Jonson, he who knew me well;"
1865,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"So, too, the epitaph which still you read?"
1866,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Think you they faced my sepulchre with
1867,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,lies &mdash;
1868,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"Gross lies, so evident and palpable"
1869,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"That every townsman must have wot of it,"
1870,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,And not a worshipper within the church
1871,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,But must have smiled to see the marbled
1872,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,fraud?
1873,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,Surely this touches you?   But if by chance
1874,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"My reasoning still leaves you obdurate,"
1875,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,I'll lay one final plea.   I pray you look
1876,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,"On my presentment, as it reaches you."
1877,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,My features shall be sponsors for my fame;
1878,SHAKESPEARE'S EXPOSTULATION,My brow shall speak when Shakespeare's

2147,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Where the proud Cecils held their sway,"
2148,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And ruled the country, more or less,"
2149,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Since the days of Good Queen Bess.
2150,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Next through Hitchin's Quaker hold
2151,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"To Bedford, where in days of old"
2152,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"John Bunyan, the unorthodox,"
2153,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Did a deal in local stocks.
2154,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Then from Bedford's peaceful nook
2155,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Our pilgrim's progress still we took
2156,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Until we slackened up our pace
2157,A LILT OF THE ROAD,In Saint Neots' market-place.
2158,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2159,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Next day, the motor flying fast,"
2160,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Through Newark, Tuxford, Retford"
2161,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"passed,"
2162,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Until at Doncaster we found
2163,A LILT OF THE ROAD,That we had crossed broad Yorkshire's
2164,A LILT OF THE ROAD,bound.
2165,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Northward and ever North we pressed,"
2166,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The Brontë Country to our West.
2167,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Still on we flew without a wait,"
2168,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Skirting the edge of Harrowgate,"
2169,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And through a wild and dark ravine,"
2170,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"As bleak a pass as we have seen,"
2171,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Until we slowly circled down
2172,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And settled into Settle town.
2173,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2174,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"On Sunday, in the pouring rain,"
2175,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We started on our way again.
2176,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Through Kirkby Lonsdale on we drove,"
2177,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"The weary rain-clouds still above,"
2178,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Until at last at Windermere
2179,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We felt our final port was near,"
2180,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Thence the lake with wooded beach
2181,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Stretches far as eye can reach.
2182,A LILT OF THE ROAD,There above its shining breast
2183,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We enjoyed our welcome rest.
2184,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Tuesday saw us still in rain &mdash;
2185,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Buzzing on our road again.
2186,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2187,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Rydal first, the smallest lake,"
2188,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Famous for great Wordsworth's sake;
2189,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Grasmere next appeared in sight,"
2190,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Grim Helvellyn on the right,"
2191,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Till we made our downward way
2192,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To the streets of Keswick gray.
2193,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Then amid a weary waste
2194,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"On to Penrith Town we raced,"
2195,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And for many a flying mile,"
2196,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Past the ramparts of Carlisle,"
2197,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Till we crossed the border line
2198,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Of the land of Auld lang syne.
2199,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Here we paused at Gretna Green,"
2200,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where many curious things were seen
2201,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"At the grimy blacksmith's shop,"
2202,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where flying couples used to stop
2203,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And forge within the smithy door
2204,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The chain which lasts for evermore.
2205,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2206,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"They'd soon be back again, I think,"
2207,A LILT OF THE ROAD,If blacksmith's skill could break the link.
2208,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Ecclefechan held us next,"
2209,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where old Tom Carlyle was vexed
2210,A LILT OF THE ROAD,By the clamour and the strife
2211,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Of this strange and varied life.
2212,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We saw his pipe, we saw his hat,"
2213,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We saw the stone on which he sat.
2214,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"The solid stone is resting there,"
2215,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"But where the sitter? Where, oh! where?"
2216,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2217,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Over a dreary wilderness
2218,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We had to take our path by guess,"
2219,A LILT OF THE ROAD,For Scotland's glories don't include
2220,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The use of signs to mark the road.
2221,A LILT OF THE ROAD,For forty miles the way ran steep
2222,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Over bleak hills with scattered sheep,"
2223,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Until at last, 'neath gloomy skies,"
2224,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We saw the stately towers rise
2225,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where noble Edinburgh lies &mdash;
2226,A LILT OF THE ROAD,No city fairer or more grand
2227,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Has ever sprung from human hand.
2228,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But I must add (the more's the pity)
2229,A LILT OF THE ROAD,That though in fair Dunedin's city
2230,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Scotland's taste is quite delightful,"
2231,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The smaller Scottish towns are frightful.
2232,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2233,A LILT OF THE ROAD,When in other lands I roam
2234,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And sing ""There is no place like home."""
2235,A LILT OF THE ROAD,In this respect I must confess
2236,A LILT OF THE ROAD,That no place has its ugliness.
2237,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Here on my mother's granite breast
2238,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We settled down and took our rest.
2239,A LILT OF THE ROAD,On Saturday we ventured forth
2240,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To push our journey to the North.
2241,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2242,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Past Linlithgow first we sped,"
2243,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Where the Palace rears its head,"
2244,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Then on by Falkirk, till we pass"
2245,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The famous valley and morass
2246,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Known as Bannockburn in story,"
2247,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Brightest scene of Scottish glory.
2248,A LILT OF THE ROAD,On pleasure and instruction bent
2249,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We made the Stirling hill ascent,"
2250,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And saw the wondrous vale beneath,"
2251,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"The  lovely  valley  of  Monteith,"
2252,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Stretching under sunlit skies
2253,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To where the Trossach hills arise.
2254,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Thence we turned our willing car
2255,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Westward ho!   to Callander,"
2256,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where childish memories awoke
2257,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"In the wood of ash and oak,"
2258,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where in days so long gone by
2259,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"I heard the woodland pigeons cry,"
2260,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And, consternation in my face,"
2261,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Legged it to some safer place.
2262,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2263,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Next morning first we viewed a mound,"
2264,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Memorial of some saint renowned,"
2265,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And then the mouldered ditch and ramp
2266,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Which marked an ancient Roman camp.
2267,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Then past Lubnaig on we went,"
2268,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Gazed on Ben Ledi's steep ascent,"
2269,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And passed by lovely stream and valley
2270,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Through Dochart Glen to reach Dalmally,"
2271,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where on a rough and winding track
2272,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We wished ourselves in safety back;
2273,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Till on our left we gladly saw
2274,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"The spreading waters of Loch Awe,"
2275,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And still more gladly truth to tell &mdash;
2276,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"A very up-to-date hotel,"
2277,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"With Conan's church within its ground,"
2278,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Which gave it quite a homely sound.
2279,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Thither we came upon the Sunday,"
2280,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Viewed Kilchurn Castle on the Monday,"
2281,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And Tuesday saw us sally forth
2282,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Bound for Oban and the North.
2283,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2284,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We came to Oban in the rain,"
2285,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"I need not mention it again,"
2286,A LILT OF THE ROAD,For you may take it as a fact
2287,A LILT OF THE ROAD,That in that Western Highland tract
2288,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"It sometimes spouts and sometimes drops,"
2289,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"But never, never, never stops."
2290,A LILT OF THE ROAD,From Oban on we thought it well
2291,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To take the steamer for a spell.
2292,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But ere the motor went aboard
2293,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The Pass of Melfort we explored.
2294,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"A lovelier vale, more full of peace,"
2295,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Was never seen in classic Greece;
2296,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"A wondrous gateway, reft and torn,"
2297,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To open out the land of Lome.
2298,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Leading on for many a mile
2299,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To the kingdom of Argyle.
2300,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2301,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Wednesday saw us on our way
2302,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Steaming out from Oban Bay,"
2303,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"(Lord, it was a fearsome day!)"
2304,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To right and left we looked upon
2305,A LILT OF THE ROAD,All the lands of Stevenson &mdash;
2306,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Moidart, Morven, and Ardgour,"
2307,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Ardshiel,  Appin,  and  Mamore &mdash;"
2308,A LILT OF THE ROAD,If their tale you wish to learn
2309,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Then to ""Kidnapped"" you must turn."
2310,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Strange that one man's eager brain
2311,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Can make those dead lands live again!
2312,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"From the deck we saw Glencoe,"
2313,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where upon that night of woe
2314,A LILT OF THE ROAD,William's men did such a deed
2315,A LILT OF THE ROAD,As even now we blush to read.
2316,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Ben Nevis towered on our right,"
2317,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"The clouds concealed it from our sight,"
2318,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But it was comforting to say
2319,A LILT OF THE ROAD,That over there Ben Nevis lay'.
2320,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Finally we made the land
2321,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"At Fort William's sloping strand,"
2322,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And in our car away we went
2323,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Along that lasting monument,"
2324,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The good broad causeway which was made
2325,A LILT OF THE ROAD,By King George's General Wade.
2326,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"He built a splendid road, no doubt,"
2327,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Alas! he left the sign-posts out.
2328,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"And so we wandered, sad to say,"
2329,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Far from our appointed way,"
2330,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Till twenty mile of rugged track
2331,A LILT OF THE ROAD,In a circle brought us back.
2332,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But the incident we viwed
2333,A LILT OF THE ROAD,In a philosophic mood.
2334,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Tired and hungry but serene
2335,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We settled at the Bridge of Spean.
2336,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2337,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Our journey now we onward press
2338,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Toward the town of Inverness,"
2339,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Through a country all alive
2340,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"With memories of ""forty-five."""
2341,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"The noble clans once gathered here,"
2342,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where now are only grouse and deer.
2343,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Alas, that men and crops and herds"
2344,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Should ever yield their place to birds!
2345,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And that the splendid Highland race
2346,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Be swept aside to give more space
2347,A LILT OF THE ROAD,For forests where the deer may stray
2348,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"For some rich owner far away,"
2349,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Whose keeper guards the lonely glen
2350,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Which once sent out a hundred men!
2351,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"When from Inverness we turned,"
2352,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Feeling that a rest was earned.
2353,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We stopped at Nairn, for golf links famed,"
2354,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"""Scotland's Brighton"" it is named,"
2355,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Though really, when the phrase we heard,"
2356,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"It seemed a little bit absurd,"
2357,A LILT OF THE ROAD,For Brighton's size compared to Nairn
2358,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Is just a mother to her bairn.
2359,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We halted for a day of rest,"
2360,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But took one journey to the West
2361,A LILT OF THE ROAD,To view old Cawdor's tower and moat
2362,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Of which unrivalled Shakespeare wrote,"
2363,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Where once Macbeth, the schemer deep,"
2364,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Slew royal Duncan in his sleep,"
2365,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But actors since avenged his death
2366,A LILT OF THE ROAD,By often murdering Macbeth.
2367,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Hard by we saw the circles gray
2368,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where Druid priests were wont to pray.
2369,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2370,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Three crumbling monuments we found,"
2371,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"With Stonehenge monoliths around,"
2372,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But who had built and who had planned
2373,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We tried in vain to understand,"
2374,A LILT OF THE ROAD,As future learned men may search
2375,A LILT OF THE ROAD,The reasons for our village church.
2376,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"This was our limit, for next day"
2377,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"We turned upon, our homeward way,"
2378,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Passing   first   Culloden's   plain
2379,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where the tombstones of the slain
2380,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Loom above the purple heather.
2381,A LILT OF THE ROAD,There the clansmen lie together &mdash;
2382,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Men from many an outland skerry,"
2383,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Men from Athol and Glengarry,"
2384,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Camerons from wild  Mamore,"
2385,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"MacDonalds from the Irish Shore,"
2386,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Red MacGregors and McLeods
2387,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"With their tartans for their shrouds,"
2388,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Menzies, Malcolms from the islands,"
2389,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Frasers from the upper Highlands &mdash;
2390,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Callous is the passer by
2391,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Who can turn without a sigh
2392,A LILT OF THE ROAD,From the tufts of heather deep
2393,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Where the noble clansmen sleep.
2394,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Now we swiftly made our way
2395,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"To Kingussie in Strathspey,"
2396,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Skirting many a nameless loch
2397,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"As we flew through Badenoch,"
2398,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Till   at   Killiecrankie's  Pass,"
2399,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Heather changing  into grass
2400,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We descended once again
2401,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"To the fertile lowland plain,"
2402,A LILT OF THE ROAD,And by Perth and old Dunblane
2403,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Reached the banks of Allan Water,"
2404,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Famous for the miller's daughter,"
2405,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Whence at last we circled back
2406,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Till we crossed our Stirling track.
2407,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"So our little journey ended,"
2408,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Gladness and instruction blended &mdash;
2409,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Not a care to spoil our pleasure,"
2410,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Not a thought to break our leisure,"
2411,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Drifting on from Sussex hedges
2412,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Up through Yorkshire's fells and ledges
2413,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Past the deserts and morasses
2414,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"Of the dreary Border passes,"
2415,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Through the scenes of Scottish story
2416,A LILT OF THE ROAD,Past the fields of battles gory.
2417,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2418,A LILT OF THE ROAD,In the future it will seem
2419,A LILT OF THE ROAD,"To have been a happy dream,"
2420,A LILT OF THE ROAD,But unless my hopes are vain
2421,A LILT OF THE ROAD,We may dream it soon again.
2422,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2423,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2424,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2425,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2426,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
2427,A LILT OF THE ROAD,
