58,EDITOR’S PREFACE,
59,EDITOR’S PREFACE,This book is intended to be a representative collection of the
60,EDITOR’S PREFACE,patriotic poetry of the British Empire. I have taken a wide view of the
61,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"term “patriotic”--wide enough, indeed, to include the Jacobite Songs of"
62,EDITOR’S PREFACE,Scotland and the National Songs of Ireland.
63,EDITOR’S PREFACE,
64,EDITOR’S PREFACE,Many of my numbers breathe the spirit of war; for the national instinct
65,EDITOR’S PREFACE,is most deeply stirred in times of great national emotion. But I have
66,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"aimed at making this volume something more than a book of war-songs,"
67,EDITOR’S PREFACE,holding that a man may prove his patriotism as well at home in the
68,EDITOR’S PREFACE,pursuit of his daily business as on the battlefield in the presence of
69,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"his country’s enemies. Love of country is the root of the matter; and,"
70,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"after all, it is harder to live for one’s country than to die for it."
71,EDITOR’S PREFACE,
72,EDITOR’S PREFACE,I gratefully acknowledge the debt I owe to authors and owners of
73,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"copyright poems. I am equally grateful to all who, whether at home or"
74,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"in the Colonies, have given me encouragement, assistance, or advice."
75,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"My obligations to Professor Dowden, Mr. W. E. Henley, and Mr. A. T."
76,EDITOR’S PREFACE,Quiller-Couch are very great.
77,EDITOR’S PREFACE,
78,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"My scheme, as originally conceived, provided for the inclusion"
79,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"of a section representing the patriotism of America; but, on"
80,EDITOR’S PREFACE,"reconsideration, I have decided not to go beyond the limits of the"
81,EDITOR’S PREFACE,British Empire.

91,INTRODUCTION,"The present collection of patriotic songs will, I think, accord with"
92,INTRODUCTION,the imperial spirit of the day; for they are representative of the
93,INTRODUCTION,whole British Empire.
94,INTRODUCTION,
95,INTRODUCTION,It is needless to dwell upon the inspiring energy of song. Since
96,INTRODUCTION,the age of Tyrtæus it has everywhere been recognised as a powerful
97,INTRODUCTION,incentive to valour. A nation can scarcely exist without a national
98,INTRODUCTION,anthem. How characteristic are the anthems of the nations! It may
99,INTRODUCTION,almost be said that the difference of the English and the French
100,INTRODUCTION,nations is expressed by the contrast between _God Save the King_ and
101,INTRODUCTION,the _Marseillaise_. What an influence songs have exercised upon the
102,INTRODUCTION,"life of nations! The debt of Scotland to Burns, the debt of Ireland to"
103,INTRODUCTION,"Moore, is greater than words can tell. Fletcher of Saltoun was perhaps"
104,INTRODUCTION,"not wrong in his estimate of the songs, as compared with the laws, of a"
105,INTRODUCTION,nation.
106,INTRODUCTION,
107,INTRODUCTION,"I am not responsible for the present collection; perhaps, if I had made"
108,INTRODUCTION,"it, I should have left out some few songs which find a place in it, and"
109,INTRODUCTION,"should have inserted some few others which do not, but the purpose of"
110,INTRODUCTION,"it I heartily approve. To consolidate the Empire, and to animate it as"
111,INTRODUCTION,"a whole with noble ideas, is one of the greatest needs and duties of"
112,INTRODUCTION,"the present day; and an empire, like an individual, lives not by bread"
113,INTRODUCTION,"alone, but by its sentiments, its ambitions, its ideals."

1392,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,For seven hours to all men’s view

1410,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,The sharp steel-pointed arrows

1835,SONG OF THE EMIGRANTS IN BERMUDA,With cedars chosen by His hand
1836,SONG OF THE EMIGRANTS IN BERMUDA,"From Lebanon He stores the land,"
1837,SONG OF THE EMIGRANTS IN BERMUDA,And makes the hollow seas that roar

1840,SONG OF THE EMIGRANTS IN BERMUDA,"The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast,"

2606,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
2607,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,And was Jerusalem builded here
2608,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,Among these dark satanic mills?
2609,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,
2610,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,Bring me my bow of burning gold!
2611,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,Bring me my arrows of desire!
2612,JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND,"Bring me my spear: O clouds, unfold!"

3359,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Her children’s sharp swords out;--
3360,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Proud Austria’s bright spurs streaming red
3361,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,When rose the closing shout;
3362,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"But soon the steeds rush’d masterless,"
3363,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"By tower, and town, and wood;"
3364,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,For lordly France her fiery youth
3365,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Poured o’er them like a flood.
3366,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Go, hew the gold spurs from your heels,"
3367,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,And let your steeds run free;

3373,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"There is no sound from stem to stern,"
3374,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,For peace has pluck’d her pride;
3375,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"The masts are down, the cannon mute"
3376,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"She shows nor sheet nor sail,"
3377,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Nor starts forth with the seaward breeze,"
3378,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Nor answers shout nor hail;
3379,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Her merry men, with all their mirth,"
3380,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Have sought some other shore;
3381,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"And she with all her glory on,"
3382,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Shall rule the sea no more.
3383,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,
3384,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,So landsmen speak. Lo! her top-masts
3385,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Are quivering in the sky;
3386,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Her sails are spread, her anchor’s raised,"
3387,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,There sweeps she gallant by.
3388,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,A thousand warriors fill her decks;
3389,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Within her painted side
3390,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,The thunder sleeps--man’s might has nought
3391,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Can match or mar her pride.
3392,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,In victor glory goes she forth;
3393,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,Her stainless flag flies free;
3394,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Kings of the earth, come and behold"

3398,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Of fierce Napoleon trod,"

3400,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Where we triumphant rode,"

3403,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"They came--they got the Nelson-touch,"
3404,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,And vanish’d as they came.
3405,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,"Go, hang your bridles in your halls,"
3406,THE BRITISH SAILOR’S SONG,And set your war-steeds free;

3558,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"Music arose with its voluptuous swell,"
3559,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,"
3560,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,And all went merry as a marriage bell;

3571,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,Arm! Arm! it is--it is--the cannon’s opening roar!
3572,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,
3573,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,Within a windowed niche of that high hall
3574,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,Sate Brunswick’s fated Chieftain; he did hear

3576,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,And caught its tone with Death’s prophetic ear;
3577,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"And when they smiled because he deemed it near,"

3579,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,"

3586,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness--
3587,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"And there were sudden partings, such as press"
3588,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs"

3618,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"Which now beneath them, but above shall grow"

3842,THE ARMADA,"I tell of the thrice famous deeds she wrought in ancient days,"
3843,THE ARMADA,When that great fleet invincible against her bore in vain
3844,THE ARMADA,"The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts of Spain."
3845,THE ARMADA,"It was about the lovely close of a warm summer day,"
3846,THE ARMADA,There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;
3847,THE ARMADA,"Her crew hath seen Castile’s black fleet, beyond Aurigny’s isle,"
3848,THE ARMADA,"At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile."
3849,THE ARMADA,"At sunrise she escaped their van, by God’s especial grace;"
3850,THE ARMADA,"And the tall _Pinta_, till the noon, had held her close in chase."
3851,THE ARMADA,Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;
3852,THE ARMADA,The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe’s lofty hall;
3853,THE ARMADA,"Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast,"
3854,THE ARMADA,And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.
3855,THE ARMADA,"With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;"
3856,THE ARMADA,Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums;
3857,THE ARMADA,His yeomen round the market cross make clear an ample space;
3858,THE ARMADA,For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace.
3859,THE ARMADA,"And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,"
3860,THE ARMADA,As slow upon the labouring wind the royal blazon swells.
3861,THE ARMADA,"Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,"
3862,THE ARMADA,And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down!
3863,THE ARMADA,"So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,"
3864,THE ARMADA,"Bohemia’s plume, and Genoa’s bow, and Cæsar’s eagle shield."
3865,THE ARMADA,"So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,"
3866,THE ARMADA,And crushed and torn beneath his claws the princely hunters lay.
3867,THE ARMADA,"Ho! strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight: ho! scatter flowers,"
3868,THE ARMADA,fair maids:
3869,THE ARMADA,"Ho! gunners, fire a loud salute: ho! gallants, draw your blades:"
3870,THE ARMADA,"Thou sun, shine on her joyously: ye breezes, waft her wide;"
3871,THE ARMADA,"Our glorious SEMPER EADEM, the banner of our pride."
3872,THE ARMADA,
3873,THE ARMADA,The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner’s massy fold;
3874,THE ARMADA,The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;
3875,THE ARMADA,"Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the purple sea,"
3876,THE ARMADA,"Such night in England ne’er had been, nor e’er again shall be."
3877,THE ARMADA,"From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,"
3878,THE ARMADA,That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;
3879,THE ARMADA,"For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread,"
3880,THE ARMADA,High on St. Michael’s Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.
3881,THE ARMADA,"Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,"
3882,THE ARMADA,"Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire."
3883,THE ARMADA,The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar’s glittering waves:
3884,THE ARMADA,The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip’s sunless caves!
3885,THE ARMADA,"O’er Longleat’s towers, o’er Cranbourne’s oaks, the fiery"
3886,THE ARMADA,herald flew:
3887,THE ARMADA,"He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu."
3888,THE ARMADA,"Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,"
3889,THE ARMADA,And ere the day three hundred horse had met on Clifton down;
3890,THE ARMADA,The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night;
3891,THE ARMADA,And saw o’erhanging Richmond Hill the streak of blood-red light:
3892,THE ARMADA,"Then bugle’s note and cannon’s roar the death-like silence broke,"
3893,THE ARMADA,"And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke."
3894,THE ARMADA,At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;
3895,THE ARMADA,At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;
3896,THE ARMADA,From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear;
3897,THE ARMADA,And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer;
3898,THE ARMADA,"And from the furthest wards was heard the rush of hurrying feet,"
3899,THE ARMADA,And the broad streams of pikes and flags rushed down each
3900,THE ARMADA,roaring street;
3901,THE ARMADA,"And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,"
3902,THE ARMADA,As fast from every village round the horse came spurring in.
3903,THE ARMADA,"And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went,"
3904,THE ARMADA,And roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent.
3905,THE ARMADA,Southward from Surrey’s pleasant hills flew those bright couriers
3906,THE ARMADA,forth;
3907,THE ARMADA,High on bleak Hampstead’s swarthy moor they started for the north;
3908,THE ARMADA,"And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still:"
3909,THE ARMADA,All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from
3910,THE ARMADA,hill to hill:
3911,THE ARMADA,"Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o’er Darwin’s rocky dales,"
3912,THE ARMADA,"Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy hills of Wales,"
3913,THE ARMADA,"Till twelve fair Counties saw the blaze on Malvern’s lonely height,"
3914,THE ARMADA,"Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin’s crest of light,"
3915,THE ARMADA,"Till broad and fierce the star came forth on Ely’s stately fane,"
3916,THE ARMADA,And tower and hamlet rose in arms o’er all the boundless plain;
3917,THE ARMADA,"Till Belvoir’s lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,"
3918,THE ARMADA,And Lincoln sped the message on o’er the wide vale of Trent;
3919,THE ARMADA,"Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt’s embattled pile,"
3920,THE ARMADA,And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle.

5130,TRAFALGAR,For the fleet of France and the force of Spain were gather’d

5132,TRAFALGAR,"A greater than Philip their lord, a new Armada in might:--"
5133,TRAFALGAR,"And the sails were aloft once more in the deep Gaditanian bay,"

5149,TRAFALGAR,"They could choose,--they were more than we;--and they faced at"
5150,TRAFALGAR,Trafalgar round;
5151,TRAFALGAR,"Rampart-like ranged in line, a sea-fortress angrily towered!"
5152,TRAFALGAR,"In the midst, four-storied with guns, the dark _Trinidada_ lower’d."
5153,TRAFALGAR,
5154,TRAFALGAR,"So with those--But, meanwhile, as against some dyke that men"

5172,TRAFALGAR,"Clothe them in billowy snow, tier speaking o’er tier as they lay;"
5173,TRAFALGAR,"Flashes that thrust and drew in, as swords when the battle is rife;--"

5175,TRAFALGAR,"--O in that interval grim, ere the furies of slaughter embrace,"
5176,TRAFALGAR,Thrills o’er each man some far echo of England; some glance
5177,TRAFALGAR,of some face!
5178,TRAFALGAR,--Faces gazing seaward through tears from the ocean-girt shore;

5185,TRAFALGAR,--Louder and thicker the thunderbolts fall:--and silent they come.
5186,TRAFALGAR,
5187,TRAFALGAR,"As when beyond Dongola the lion, whom hunters attack,"

5191,TRAFALGAR,Iron hailing of pitiless death from the sulphury smoke;

5204,TRAFALGAR,"From the deck the smoke-wreath clear’d, and the foe set his"

5206,TRAFALGAR,"Dastardly aiming, where Nelson stood forth, with the stars on"

5212,TRAFALGAR,Silent the whole fleet’s darling they bore to the twilight below:

5215,TRAFALGAR,
5216,TRAFALGAR,"To his heart death rose: and for Hardy, the faithful, he cried in"

5613,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,
5614,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,They had not heart to dare fulfil

5619,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,The warriors of his wasted band:
5620,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,"Then said he, feeling death at hand,"
5621,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,
5622,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,"‘Here die I, Richard Grenville,"
5623,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,With a joyful and quiet mind;

5628,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,And died as a true soldier ought.’
5629,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,
5630,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,Earth never returned a worthier trust
5631,SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE’S LAST FIGHT,"For hand of Heaven to take,"

5711,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5712,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"O, ’twas merry down to Looe when the news was carried through"
5713,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,That the _George_ would put to sea all with the morning tide;
5714,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And all her jolly crew hurrah’d till they were blue
5715,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"When the captain said, ‘My lads, we’ll tan the Frenchman’s hide!’"
5716,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5717,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"For Captain Davy Dann was a famous fightin’ man,"
5718,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"Who lov’d the smell o’ powder and the thunder o’ the guns,"
5719,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And off the coast of France often made the Frenchmen dance
5720,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,To the music from his sloop of only ninety tons.
5721,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5722,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,So at the break o’ day there were hundreds on the quay
5723,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,To see the gallant ship a-warping out to sea;
5724,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And the Mayor, Daniel Chubb, was hoisted on a tub,"
5725,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And he cried, ‘Good luck to Dann, with a three times three!’"
5726,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5727,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,For the news that came from Fowey was that ev’ry man and boy
5728,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And all the gallants there were expecting of a ship.
5729,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And the lively lads o’ Looe, they thought they’d watch her too,"
5730,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,Lest the Frenchman showed his heels and gave ’em all the slip.
5731,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5732,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"So along by Talland Bay the good ship sailed away,"
5733,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And the boats were out at Polperro to see what they could see;
5734,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And old Dann, he cried, ‘Ahoy! you’d better come to Fowey,"
5735,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And help to blow the Mounseers to the bottom of the sea!’
5736,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5737,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"Now, ’twas almost set o’ sun, and the day was almost done,"
5738,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,When we sighted of a frigate beating up against the wind;
5739,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And we put on all our sail till we came within her hail,"
5740,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And old Dann politely asked, ‘Will you follow us behind?’"
5741,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5742,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"But the Frenchmen fore and aft only stood and grinned and laughed,"
5743,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And never guessed the captain was in earnest, don’t you see?"
5744,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"For we’d only half her guns, and were only ninety tons,"
5745,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And they thought they’d blow us easy to the bottom o’ the sea.
5746,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5747,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"But our brave old Captain Dann--oh, he was a proper man!--"
5748,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,Sang out with voice like thunder unto ev’ry man aboard:
5749,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"‘Now all you men of Looe just show what you can do,"
5750,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And we’ll board her, and we’ll take her, by the help o’ the Lord!’"
5751,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5752,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"Then up her sides we swarm’d, and along her deck we storm’d,"
5753,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And sword and pike were busy for the space of half an hour;
5754,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"But before the day was done, tho’ they number’d two to one,"
5755,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"Her commander had to yield, and his flag to lower."
5756,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5757,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"Then we turn’d our ship about, and while the stars came out"
5758,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,We tow’d our prize right cheerily past Fowey and Polperro;
5759,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And we blest old Captain Dann, for we hadn’t lost a man,"
5760,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And our wounded all were doing well a-down below.
5761,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,
5762,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And when we came to Looe, all the town was there to view,"
5763,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"And the mayor in his chain and gown he cried out lustily,"
5764,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,"‘Nine cheers for Captain Dann, and three for every man,"
5765,THE _GEORGE_ OF LOOE,And the good ship _George_ that carried them to victory!’

7440,THE BARD,"‘Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!"
7441,THE BARD,Confusion on thy banners wait!
7442,THE BARD,Though fanned by Conquest’s crimson wing
7443,THE BARD,They mock the air with idle state.
7444,THE BARD,"Helm, nor hauberk’s twisted mail,"
7445,THE BARD,"Nor e’en thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail"
7446,THE BARD,"To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,"
7447,THE BARD,"From Cambria’s curse, from Cambria’s tears.’"
7448,THE BARD,Such were the sounds that o’er the crested pride
7449,THE BARD,"Of the first Edward scattered wild dismay,"
7450,THE BARD,As down the steep of Snowdon’s shaggy side
7451,THE BARD,He wound with toilsome march his long array:
7452,THE BARD,Stout Glo’ster stood aghast in speechless trance;
7453,THE BARD,"‘To arms!’ cried Mortimer, and couched his quivering lance."
7454,THE BARD,
7455,THE BARD,"On a rock, whose haughty brow"
7456,THE BARD,"Frowns o’er old Conway’s foaming flood,"
7457,THE BARD,"Robed in the sable garb of woe,"
7458,THE BARD,With haggard eyes the poet stood
7459,THE BARD,"(Loose his beard, and hoary hair"
7460,THE BARD,"Streamed like a meteor to the troubled air),"
7461,THE BARD,"And with a master’s hand and prophet’s fire,"
7462,THE BARD,Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre:
7463,THE BARD,"‘Hark, how each giant oak, and desert cave"
7464,THE BARD,Sighs to the torrent’s awful voice beneath!
7465,THE BARD,"O’er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave,"
7466,THE BARD,Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;
7467,THE BARD,"Vocal no more, since Cambria’s fatal day,"

7483,THE BARD,Ye died amidst your dying country’s cries!--
7484,THE BARD,No more I weep. They do not sleep.
7485,THE BARD,"On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,"
7486,THE BARD,"I see them sit; they linger yet,"
7487,THE BARD,Avengers of their native land:
7488,THE BARD,"With me in dreadful harmony they join,"
7489,THE BARD,And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line.
7490,THE BARD,
7491,THE BARD,"‘Weave the warp and weave the woof,"
7492,THE BARD,The winding-sheet of Edward’s race:
7493,THE BARD,Give ample room and verge enough
7494,THE BARD,The characters of hell to trace.
7495,THE BARD,Mark the year and mark the night
7496,THE BARD,When Severn shall re-echo with affright
7497,THE BARD,"The shrieks of death through Berkeley’s roof that ring,"
7498,THE BARD,Shrieks of an agonizing king!
7499,THE BARD,"She-wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs,"
7500,THE BARD,"That tear’st the bowels of thy mangled mate,"
7501,THE BARD,"From thee be born, who o’er thy country hangs"
7502,THE BARD,The scourge of Heaven. What terrors round him wait!
7503,THE BARD,"Amazement in his van, with Flight combined,"
7504,THE BARD,"And Sorrow’s faded form, and Solitude behind."
7505,THE BARD,
7506,THE BARD,"‘Mighty victor, mighty lord,"

7508,THE BARD,"No pitying heart, no eye, afford"
7509,THE BARD,A tear to grace his obsequies.
7510,THE BARD,Is the sable warrior fled?
7511,THE BARD,Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead.
7512,THE BARD,The swarm that in thy noontide beam were born?
7513,THE BARD,Gone to salute the rising morn.
7514,THE BARD,"Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the zephyr blows,"
7515,THE BARD,While proudly riding o’er the azure realm
7516,THE BARD,In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes:
7517,THE BARD,Youth on the prow and Pleasure at the helm:
7518,THE BARD,"Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind’s sway,"
7519,THE BARD,That hushed in grim repose expects his evening prey.
7520,THE BARD,
7521,THE BARD,"‘Fill high the sparkling bowl,"
7522,THE BARD,The rich repast prepare;
7523,THE BARD,"Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast:"
7524,THE BARD,Close by the regal chair
7525,THE BARD,Fell Thirst and Famine scowl
7526,THE BARD,A baleful smile upon their baffled guest.
7527,THE BARD,"Heard ye the din of battle bray,"
7528,THE BARD,Lance to lance and horse to horse?
7529,THE BARD,"Long years of havoc urge their destined course,"
7530,THE BARD,And through the kindred squadrons mow their way.
7531,THE BARD,"Ye towers of Julius, London’s lasting shame,"
7532,THE BARD,"With many a foul and midnight murder fed,"
7533,THE BARD,"Revere his consort’s faith, his father’s fame,"
7534,THE BARD,And spare the meek usurper’s holy head!
7535,THE BARD,"Above, below, the rose of snow,"
7536,THE BARD,"Twined with her blushing foe, we spread:"
7537,THE BARD,The bristled boar in infant-gore
7538,THE BARD,Wallows beneath the thorny shade.
7539,THE BARD,"Now, brothers, bending o’er the accursed loom,"
7540,THE BARD,"Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom."

7542,THE BARD,"‘Edward, lo! to sudden fate"
7543,THE BARD,(Weave we the woof; the thread is spun);
7544,THE BARD,Half of thy heart we consecrate
7545,THE BARD,(The web is wove; the work is done).
7546,THE BARD,"Stay, O stay! nor thus forlorn"
7547,THE BARD,"Leave me unblessed, unpitied, here to mourn:"
7548,THE BARD,In yon bright track that fires the western skies
7549,THE BARD,"They melt, they vanish from my eyes."
7550,THE BARD,But O! what solemn scenes on Snowdon’s height
7551,THE BARD,Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll?
7552,THE BARD,"Visions of glory, spare my aching sight!"
7553,THE BARD,"Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!"
7554,THE BARD,No more our long-lost Arthur we bewail:
7555,THE BARD,"All hail, ye genuine kings! Britannia’s issue, hail!"
7556,THE BARD,
7557,THE BARD,‘Girt with many a baron bold
7558,THE BARD,Sublime their starry fronts they rear;
7559,THE BARD,"And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old"
7560,THE BARD,"In bearded majesty, appear."
7561,THE BARD,In the midst a form divine!
7562,THE BARD,Her eye proclaims her of the Briton line:
7563,THE BARD,"Her lion-port, her awe-commanding face"
7564,THE BARD,Attempered sweet to virgin grace.
7565,THE BARD,"What strings symphonious tremble in the air,"
7566,THE BARD,What strains of vocal transport round her play?
7567,THE BARD,"Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;"
7568,THE BARD,They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.
7569,THE BARD,"Bright Rapture calls and, soaring as she sings,"
7570,THE BARD,Waves in the eye of Heaven her many-coloured wings.
7571,THE BARD,
7572,THE BARD,‘The verse adorn again
7573,THE BARD,Fierce War and faithful Love

7575,THE BARD,In buskined measures move
7576,THE BARD,"Pale Grief and pleasing Pain,"
7577,THE BARD,"With Horror, tyrant of the throbbing breast."
7578,THE BARD,A voice as of the cherub-choir
7579,THE BARD,"Gales from blooming Eden bear,"
7580,THE BARD,And distant warblings lessen on my ear
7581,THE BARD,That lost in long futurity expire.
7582,THE BARD,"Fond impious man, think’st thou yon sanguine cloud,"
7583,THE BARD,"Raised by thy breath, has quenched the orb of day?"
7584,THE BARD,To-morrow he repairs the golden flood
7585,THE BARD,And warms the nations with redoubled ray.
7586,THE BARD,Enough for me: with joy I see
7587,THE BARD,The different doom our fates assign:
7588,THE BARD,"Be thine Despair and sceptred Care,"
7589,THE BARD,To triumph and to die are mine.’
7590,THE BARD,"He spoke, and headlong from the mountain’s height"
7591,THE BARD,Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night.

8479,BONNIE DUNDEE,There’s brass on the target of barkened bull-hide;

10714,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"‘On with the charge!’ he cries, and waves his sword;--"
10715,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,One rolling cheer five thousand voices swell;--
10716,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"The levelled guns pour forth their leaden shower,"
10717,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,While thund’ring cannons’ roar half drowns the Huron yell.
10718,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10719,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,‘On with the charge!’ with shout and cheer they come;--
10720,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,No laggard there upon that field of fame.
10721,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"The lurid plain gleams like a seething hell,"
10722,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And every rock and tree send forth their bolts of flame.
10723,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10724,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,On! on! they sweep. Uprise the waiting ranks--
10725,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,Still as the grave--unmoved as granite wall;--
10726,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,The foe before--the dizzy crags behind--
10727,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"They fight, the day to win, or like true warriors fall."
10728,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10729,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Forward they sternly move, then halt to wait"
10730,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,That raging sea of human life now near;--
10731,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"‘Fire!’ rings from right to left,--each musket rings,"
10732,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,As if a thunder-peal had struck the startled ear.
10733,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10734,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Again, and yet again that volley flies,--"
10735,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,With deadly aim the grapeshot sweeps the field;--
10736,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"All levelled for the charge, the bayonets gleam,"
10737,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And brawny arms a thousand claymores fiercely wield.
10738,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10739,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"And down the line swells high the British cheer,"
10740,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"That on a future day woke Minden’s plain,"
10741,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And the loud slogan that fair Scotland’s foes
10742,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Have often heard with dread, and oft shall hear again."
10743,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10744,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And the shrill pipe its coronach that wailed
10745,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"On dark Culloden moor o’er trampled dead,"
10746,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Now sounds the ‘Onset’ that each clansman knows,"
10747,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Still leads the foremost rank, where noblest blood is shed."
10748,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10749,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"And on that day no nobler stained the sod,"
10750,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Than his, who for his country life laid down;"
10751,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Who, for a mighty Empire battled there,"
10752,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And strove from rival’s brow to wrest the laurel crown.
10753,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10754,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Twice struck,--he recks not, but still heads the charge,"
10755,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"But, ah! fate guides the marksman’s fatal ball:--"
10756,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"With bleeding breast, he claims a comrade’s aid,--"
10757,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"‘We win,--let not my soldiers see their Leader fall.’"
10758,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10759,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Full well he feels life’s tide is ebbing fast,--"
10760,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,When hark! ‘They run; see how they run!’ they cry.
10761,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"‘Who run?’ ‘The foe.’ His eyes flash forth one gleam,"
10762,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Then murm’ring low he sighs, ‘Praise God, in peace I die.’"
10763,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10764,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Far rolls the battle’s din, and leaves its dead,"
10765,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,As when a cyclone thro’ the forest cleaves;--
10766,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"And the dread claymore heaps the path with slain,"
10767,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,As strews the biting cold the earth with autumn leaves.
10768,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10769,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"The Fleur de Lys lies trodden on the ground,--"

10771,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"‘All’s well’ resounds from tower and battlement,"
10772,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And England’s banners proudly o’er the ramparts wave.
10773,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10774,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Slowly the mighty warships sail away,"
10775,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,To tell their country of an empire won;
10776,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"But, ah! they bear the death-roll of the slain,"
10777,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And all that mortal is of Britain’s noblest son.
10778,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10779,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"With bowèd head they lay their hero down,"
10780,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And pomp and pageant crown the deathless brave;--
10781,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Loud salvoes sing the soldier’s lullaby,"
10782,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And weeping millions bathe with tears his honoured grave.
10783,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10784,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"Then bright the bonfires blaze on Albion’s hills,--"
10785,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And rends the very sky a people’s joy;--
10786,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"And even when grief broods o’er the vacant chair,"
10787,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,The mother’s heart still nobly gives her gallant boy.
10788,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10789,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"And while broad England gleams with glorious light,"
10790,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,And merry peals from every belfry ring;--
10791,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"One little village lies all dark and still,"
10792,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,No fires are lighted there--no battle songs they sing.
10793,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,
10794,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"There in her lonely cot, in widow’s weeds,"
10795,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,A mother mourns--the silent tear-drops fall;--
10796,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"She too had given to swell proud England’s fame,"
10797,THE DEATH OF WOLFE,"But, ah! she gave the widow’s mite--she gave her all!"

11562,THE CANADIAN VOLUNTEERS,
11563,THE CANADIAN VOLUNTEERS,"Every heart of us, wild at the sight of them,"
11564,THE CANADIAN VOLUNTEERS,Beat as it never had beaten before;

12168,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,
12169,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,Our women and our children toiled beside us in the dark--
12170,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"They died, we filed their fetters, and we heaved them to the shark--"

12178,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"Woman, Man, or God or Devil, was there anything we feared?"
12179,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,

12201,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"She will need no half-mast signal, minute-gun, or rocket-flare,"
12202,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"When the cry for help goes seaward, she will find her servants there."
12203,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"Battered chain-gangs of the orlop, grizzled drafts of years gone by,"
12204,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"To the bench that broke their manhood, they shall lash themselves and"

12206,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,
12207,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"Hale and crippled, young and aged, paid, deserted, shipped away--"
12208,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"Palace, cot, and lazaretto shall make up the tale that day,"
12209,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,"When the skies are black above them, and the decks ablaze beneath,"
12210,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,And the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in
12211,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,their teeth.
12212,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,
12213,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,It may be that Fate will give me life and leave to row once more--
12214,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,Set some strong man free for fighting as I take awhile his oar.
12215,THE GALLEY-SLAVE,But to-day I leave the galley. Shall I curse her service then?

12463,DAMPIER’S DREAM,The seaman slept--all nature sleeps; a sacred stillness there
12464,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Is on the wood--is on the waves--is in the silver air.
12465,DAMPIER’S DREAM,The sky above--the silent sea--with stars were all aglow;
12466,DAMPIER’S DREAM,There shone Orion and his belt--Arcturus and his bow!
12467,DAMPIER’S DREAM,The seaman slept--or does he sleep?--what chorus greets him now?--
12468,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Wild music breaking from the deep around the vessel’s bow?
12469,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"He starts, he looks, he sees rise shadowy--can he only dream?"
12470,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"A sovereign form, wrathful, yet beauteous--in the moon’s cold beam!"

12474,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Herald thus soon of that mystic race
12475,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Fated to reign in my people’s place,"
12476,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Bringing arts of might--working wondrous spells
12477,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Where now but the simple savage dwells;

12483,DAMPIER’S DREAM,E’en the still soft gloom of my deep sea caves
12484,DAMPIER’S DREAM,A shudder has reached; over shore and bay
12485,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Bodeful the shivering moonbeams play!
12486,DAMPIER’S DREAM,The Spirit of this zone am I--
12487,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Mine are the isles and yon mainlands nigh;
12488,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"And roused from my rest by the wood-wraith’s sigh,"
12489,DAMPIER’S DREAM,And the sea-maid’s moan on the coral reef--
12490,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Voices never till now foreboding grief--
12491,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Hither I fly--
12492,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Here at the gate of my South Sea realm
12493,DAMPIER’S DREAM,To bid thee put back thy fateful helm!
12494,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Not yet is the hour, why art thou here"
12495,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Presaging dole, and scaith, and fear?’"

12499,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Meeter for thee the drear Northern sky,"
12500,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"And where wintry breakers ceaseless roar,"
12501,DAMPIER’S DREAM,And strew with wrecks a dusky shore;
12502,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Where the iceberg rears its awful form,"
12503,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Where along the billows the petrels cry--
12504,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"For, like thee, that dark bird loves the storm!"
12505,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Thou child of the clime of the Vikings wild--
12506,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Who wert nursed upon the tempest’s wing,"
12507,DAMPIER’S DREAM,A boy on the wind-beaten mast to cling--
12508,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Whose quest is prey, who hailest the day"
12509,DAMPIER’S DREAM,When gleam the red swords and the death-bolts ring!

12511,DAMPIER’S DREAM,What dost thou in scenes as soft as these?
12512,DAMPIER’S DREAM,

12514,DAMPIER’S DREAM,As I gaze thro’ the haze of long distant years.
12515,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"A mighty people speaking thy tongue,"
12516,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Sea-borne from their far, dark strands"
12517,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Shall spread abroad over all these lands
12518,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Where man now lives as when Time was young.
12519,DAMPIER’S DREAM,I see their stately cities rise
12520,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Thro’ the clouds where the future’s horizon lies;
12521,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Thro’ the purple mists shrouding river and plain,"
12522,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Where the white-foaming bay marks the hidden main;
12523,DAMPIER’S DREAM,And clearer now--I behold more clear
12524,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Great ships--sails swelling to the breeze,"
12525,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Their keels break all the virgin seas;
12526,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Vast white-winged squadrons, they come and go"
12527,DAMPIER’S DREAM,Where only has skimmed the light canoe!
12528,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Yes, the seats and the paths of empire veer,"
12529,DAMPIER’S DREAM,A highway of nations will yet be here!
12530,DAMPIER’S DREAM,As Tyre was in an ancient age;
12531,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"As Venice of palaces, strong and sage;"
12532,DAMPIER’S DREAM,As the haughty ports of your native shore
12533,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"Whose fleets override the waters’ rage,"
12534,DAMPIER’S DREAM,So shall the pride of yon cities soar.
12535,DAMPIER’S DREAM,"From the frigid Pole to the torrid Line,"
