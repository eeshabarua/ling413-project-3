88,I.,I.
89,I.,
90,I.,Your face was lifted to the golden sky
91,I.,"Ablaze beyond the black roofs of the square,"
92,I.,"As flame on flame leapt, flourishing in air"
93,I.,"Its tumult of red stars exultantly,"
94,I.,To the cold constellations dim and high;
95,I.,"And as we neared, the roaring ruddy flare"
96,I.,Kindled to gold your throat and brow and hair
97,I.,"Until you burned, a flame of ecstasy."
98,I.,
99,I.,The golden head goes down into the night
100,I.,Quenched in cold gloom--and yet again you stand
101,I.,"Beside me now with lifted face alight,"
102,I.,"As, flame to flame, and fire to fire you burn..."
103,I.,"Then, recollecting, laughingly you turn,"
104,I.,And look into my eyes and take my hand.
105,I.,
106,I.,
107,II.,II.
108,II.,
109,II.,Once in my garret--you being far away
110,II.,"Tramping the hills and breathing upland air,"
111,II.,"Or so I fancied--brooding in my chair,"
112,II.,I watched the London sunshine feeble and grey
113,II.,"Dapple my desk, too tired to labour more,"
114,II.,"When, looking up, I saw you standing there,"
115,II.,"Although I’d caught no footstep on the stair,"
116,II.,Like sudden April at my open door.
117,II.,
118,II.,"Though now beyond earth’s farthest hills you fare,"
119,II.,"Song-crowned, immortal, sometimes it seems to me"
120,II.,"That, if I listen very quietly,"
121,II.,"Perhaps I’ll hear a light foot on the stair,"
122,II.,"And see you, standing with your angel air,"
123,II.,Fresh from the uplands of eternity.
124,II.,
125,II.,
126,III.,III.
127,III.,
128,III.,Your eyes rejoiced in colour’s ecstasy
129,III.,"Fulfilling even their uttermost desire,"
130,III.,"When, over a great sunlit field afire"
131,III.,"With windy poppies, streaming like a sea"
132,III.,Of scarlet flame that flaunted riotously
133,III.,"Among green orchards of that western shire,"
134,III.,You gazed as though your heart could never tire
135,III.,Of life’s red flood in summer revelry.
136,III.,
137,III.,And as I watched you little thought had I
138,III.,How soon beneath the dim low-drifting sky
139,III.,"Your soul should wander down the darkling way,"
140,III.,"With eyes that peer a little wistfully,"
141,III.,"Half-glad, half-sad, remembering, as they see"
142,III.,"Lethean poppies, shrivelling ashen grey."
143,III.,
144,III.,
145,IV.,IV.
146,IV.,
147,IV.,October chestnuts showered their perishing gold
148,IV.,Over us as beside the stream we lay
149,IV.,"In the Old Vicarage garden that blue day,"
150,IV.,Talking of verse and all the manifold
151,IV.,"Delights a little net of words may hold,"
152,IV.,While in the sunlight water-voles at play
153,IV.,"Dived under a trailing crimson bramble-spray,"
154,IV.,And walnuts thudded ripe on soft black mould.
155,IV.,
156,IV.,Your soul goes down unto a darker stream
157,IV.,"Alone, O friend, yet even in death’s deep night"
158,IV.,"Your eyes may grow accustomed to the dark,"
159,IV.,And Styx for you may have the ripple and gleam
160,IV.,"Of your familiar river, and Charon’s bark"
161,IV.,Tarry by that old garden of your delight.

186,TENANTS,We came upon the little house asleep

188,TENANTS,In the white magic of the full moon-blaze.
189,TENANTS,"Strangers without the gate, we stood agaze,"

192,TENANTS,Through a long year of happy nights and days
193,TENANTS,
194,TENANTS,"So unfamiliar in the white moon-gleam,"
195,TENANTS,So old and ghostly like a house of dream
196,TENANTS,"It seemed, that over us there stole the dread"
197,TENANTS,"That even as we watched it, side by side,"
198,TENANTS,"The ghosts of lovers, who had lived and died"

209,SEA-CHANGE,"And over her the little green waves flowed,"
210,SEA-CHANGE,Coldly translucent and moon-coloured showed
211,SEA-CHANGE,"Her frail young beauty, as if rapt away"

229,GOLD,"Where ceaselessly, with stiffly nodding head"
230,GOLD,And rigid motions ever to and fro
231,GOLD,A figure like a puppet in a show
232,GOLD,"Before the window moved till day was dead,"
233,GOLD,"Beating out gold to earn his daily bread,"
234,GOLD,Beating out thin fine gold-leaf blow on blow.
235,GOLD,
236,GOLD,And I within my garret all day long
237,GOLD,"Unto that ceaseless thudding tuned my song,"
238,GOLD,Beating out golden words in tune and time
239,GOLD,"To that dull thudding, rhyme on golden rhyme."

241,GOLD,With aching arms I beat fine gold for bread.

252,THE OLD BED,"As if, in a gold casket glistering bright,"

254,THE OLD BED,The sleeping child safe from the dark and cold
255,THE OLD BED,And creeping shadows of the coming night.

318,RETREAT,"He dreamt of flowers in an English lane,"
319,RETREAT,Of hedgerow flowers glistening after rain--

395,THE ORPHANS,
396,THE ORPHANS,"""Homeless, about the country-side"

410,THE PESSIMIST,
411,THE PESSIMIST,"""What this world’s coming to I cannot tell,"""
