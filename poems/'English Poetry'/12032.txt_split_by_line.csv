106,SLEEPYHEAD,"As I lay awake in the white moonlight,"
107,SLEEPYHEAD,"I heard a faint singing in the wood,"
108,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Out of bed,"
109,SLEEPYHEAD,"Sleepyhead,"
110,SLEEPYHEAD,"Put your white foot, now;"
111,SLEEPYHEAD,Here are we
112,SLEEPYHEAD,Beneath the tree
113,SLEEPYHEAD,"Singing round the root now."""
114,SLEEPYHEAD,
115,SLEEPYHEAD,"I looked out of window, in the white moonlight,"
116,SLEEPYHEAD,The leaves were like snow in the wood--
117,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Come away,"
118,SLEEPYHEAD,"Child, and play"
119,SLEEPYHEAD,Light with the gnomies;
120,SLEEPYHEAD,"In a mound,"
121,SLEEPYHEAD,"Green and round,"
122,SLEEPYHEAD,"That's where their home is."""
123,SLEEPYHEAD,
124,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Honey sweet,"
125,SLEEPYHEAD,"Curds to eat,"
126,SLEEPYHEAD,"Cream and frumenty,"
127,SLEEPYHEAD,"Shells and beads,"
128,SLEEPYHEAD,"Poppy seeds,"
129,SLEEPYHEAD,"You shall have plenty."""
130,SLEEPYHEAD,
131,SLEEPYHEAD,"But, as soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight"
132,SLEEPYHEAD,"To put on my stocking and my shoe,"
133,SLEEPYHEAD,"The sweet shrill singing echoed faintly away,"
134,SLEEPYHEAD,"And the grey of the morning peeped through,"
135,SLEEPYHEAD,And instead of the gnomies there came a red robin
136,SLEEPYHEAD,To sing of the buttercups and dew.

144,BLUEBELLS,"Where the bluebells and the wind are,"
145,BLUEBELLS,"Fairies in a ring I spied,"
146,BLUEBELLS,And I heard a little linnet
147,BLUEBELLS,Singing near beside.
148,BLUEBELLS,
149,BLUEBELLS,Where the primrose and the dew are--
150,BLUEBELLS,Soon were sped the fairies all:
151,BLUEBELLS,"Only now the green turf freshens,"
152,BLUEBELLS,And the linnets call.

160,LOVELOCKS,I watched the Lady Caroline
161,LOVELOCKS,Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;
162,LOVELOCKS,"Her face was rosy in the glass,"
163,LOVELOCKS,"And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,"
164,LOVELOCKS,White in the candleshine.
165,LOVELOCKS,
166,LOVELOCKS,"Her bottles on the table lay,"
167,LOVELOCKS,"Stoppered, yet sweet of violet;"
168,LOVELOCKS,Her image in the mirror stooped
169,LOVELOCKS,To view those locks as lightly looped
170,LOVELOCKS,As cherry boughs in May.
171,LOVELOCKS,
172,LOVELOCKS,"The snowy night lay dim without,"
173,LOVELOCKS,I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;
174,LOVELOCKS,The window smouldered keen with frost;
175,LOVELOCKS,"Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed"
176,LOVELOCKS,Her beauteous hair about.

184,TARTARY,"If I were Lord of Tartary,"
185,TARTARY,"Myself and me alone,"
186,TARTARY,"My bed should be of ivory,"
187,TARTARY,Of beaten gold my throne;
188,TARTARY,"And in my court would peacocks flaunt,"
189,TARTARY,"And in my forests tigers haunt,"
190,TARTARY,And in my pools great fishes slant
191,TARTARY,Their fins athwart the sun.
192,TARTARY,
193,TARTARY,"If I were Lord of Tartary,"
194,TARTARY,Trumpeters every day
195,TARTARY,"To every meal should summon me,"
196,TARTARY,And in my courtyard bray;
197,TARTARY,"And in the evening lamps would shine,"
198,TARTARY,"Yellow as honey, red as wine,"
199,TARTARY,"While harp, and flute, and mandoline,"
200,TARTARY,Made music sweet and gay.
201,TARTARY,
202,TARTARY,"If I were Lord of Tartary,"
203,TARTARY,"I'd wear a robe of beads,"
204,TARTARY,"White, and gold, and green they'd be--"
205,TARTARY,And clustered thick as seeds;
206,TARTARY,"And ere should wane the morning-star,"
207,TARTARY,"I'd don my robe and scimitar,"
208,TARTARY,And zebras seven should draw my car
209,TARTARY,Through Tartary's dark glades.
210,TARTARY,
211,TARTARY,"Lord of the fruits of Tartary,"
212,TARTARY,Her rivers silver-pale!
213,TARTARY,"Lord of the hills of Tartary,"
214,TARTARY,"Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!"
215,TARTARY,"Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,"
216,TARTARY,"Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,"
217,TARTARY,Her bird-delighting citron-trees
218,TARTARY,In every purple vale!

226,THE BUCKLE,"I had a silver buckle,"
227,THE BUCKLE,"I sewed it on my shoe,"
228,THE BUCKLE,And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe
229,THE BUCKLE,I danced the evening through.
230,THE BUCKLE,
231,THE BUCKLE,"I had a bunch of cowslips,"
232,THE BUCKLE,"I hid them in a grot,"
233,THE BUCKLE,In case the elves should come by night
234,THE BUCKLE,And me remember not.
235,THE BUCKLE,
236,THE BUCKLE,"I had a yellow riband,"
237,THE BUCKLE,"I tied it in my hair,"
238,THE BUCKLE,"That, walking in the garden,"
239,THE BUCKLE,The birds might see it there.
240,THE BUCKLE,
241,THE BUCKLE,"I had a secret laughter,"
242,THE BUCKLE,I laughed it near the wall:
243,THE BUCKLE,Only the ivy and the wind
244,THE BUCKLE,May tell of it at all.

252,THE HARE,In the black furrow of a field
253,THE HARE,I saw an old witch-hare this night;
254,THE HARE,"And she cocked a lissome ear,"
255,THE HARE,"And she eyed the moon so bright,"
256,THE HARE,And she nibbled of the green;
257,THE HARE,"And I whispered ""Wh-s-st! witch-hare,"""
258,THE HARE,Away like a ghostie o'er the field
259,THE HARE,"She fled, and left the moonlight there."

288,JOHN MOULDY,"I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,"
289,JOHN MOULDY,Deep down twenty steps of stone;
290,JOHN MOULDY,"In the dusk he sat a-smiling,"
291,JOHN MOULDY,Smiling there alone.
292,JOHN MOULDY,
293,JOHN MOULDY,"He read no book, he snuffed no candle;"
294,JOHN MOULDY,"The rats ran in, the rats ran out;"
295,JOHN MOULDY,"And far and near, the drip of water"
296,JOHN MOULDY,Went whispering about.
297,JOHN MOULDY,
298,JOHN MOULDY,"The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,"
299,JOHN MOULDY,"I saw the Dog Star bleak and grim,"
300,JOHN MOULDY,I saw a slim brown rat of Norway
301,JOHN MOULDY,Creep over him.

316,THE FLY,"A rosebud like a feather bed,"
317,THE FLY,Its prickle like a spear;
318,THE FLY,
319,THE FLY,"A dewdrop like a looking-glass,"
320,THE FLY,A hair like golden wire;
321,THE FLY,The smallest grain of mustard-seed
322,THE FLY,As fierce as coals of fire;
323,THE FLY,
324,THE FLY,"A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;"
325,THE FLY,"A wasp, a cruel leopard;"

365,I SAW THREE WITCHES,"And, mounting a storm-cloud,"
366,I SAW THREE WITCHES,"Aloft on its margin,"
367,I SAW THREE WITCHES,Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.

380,I SAW THREE WITCHES,"Concealed their grim faces,"
381,I SAW THREE WITCHES,Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.
382,I SAW THREE WITCHES,
383,I SAW THREE WITCHES,I saw three witches
384,I SAW THREE WITCHES,"Asleep in a valley,"

400,THE SILVER PENNY,
401,THE SILVER PENNY,"""Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye"
402,THE SILVER PENNY,"And your dear sister Jenny,"
403,THE SILVER PENNY,But pay she shall her golden locks
404,THE SILVER PENNY,"Instead of your penny."""
405,THE SILVER PENNY,
406,THE SILVER PENNY,"They sail away, they sail away,"
407,THE SILVER PENNY,O fierce the winds blew!
408,THE SILVER PENNY,"The foam flew in clouds,"
409,THE SILVER PENNY,And dark the night grew!
410,THE SILVER PENNY,
411,THE SILVER PENNY,And all the wild sea-water
412,THE SILVER PENNY,Climbed steep into the boat;
413,THE SILVER PENNY,Back to the shore again
414,THE SILVER PENNY,Sail they will not.
415,THE SILVER PENNY,
416,THE SILVER PENNY,"Drowned is the sailorman,"

430,THE RAINBOW,As the rain swept by.
431,THE RAINBOW,
432,THE RAINBOW,In bright-ringed solitude
433,THE RAINBOW,The showery foliage shone

445,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills
446,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--"
447,THE FAIRIES DANCING,I heard the fairies in a ring
448,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Sing as they tripped a lilting round
449,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Soft as the moon on wavering wing.
450,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"The starlight shook as if with sound,"
451,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"As if with echoing, and the stars"
452,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;
453,THE FAIRIES DANCING,While red with war the gusty Mars
454,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.
455,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"He shone alone, low down the West,"
456,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,"
457,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed
458,THE FAIRIES DANCING,The fires of the morning flush.
459,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"Till, as a mist, their beauty died,"
460,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Their singing shrill and fainter grew;
461,THE FAIRIES DANCING,And daylight tremulous and wide
462,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Flooded the moorland through and through;
463,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Till Urdon's copper weathercock
464,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"Was reared in golden flame afar,"
465,THE FAIRIES DANCING,And dim from moonlit dreams awoke
466,THE FAIRIES DANCING,The towers and groves of Arroar.

479,REVERIE,Each narrow hoof is lifted high
480,REVERIE,"Beneath the dark enclustering pines,"
481,REVERIE,A silver ray within his bit

483,REVERIE,
484,REVERIE,"His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,"
485,REVERIE,"And streams upon the shadowy air,"
486,REVERIE,"The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,"
487,REVERIE,His mistress' hair.
488,REVERIE,
489,REVERIE,"Her habit flows in darkness down,"
490,REVERIE,"Upon the stirrup rests her foot,"
491,REVERIE,"Her brow is lifted, as if earth"
492,REVERIE,She heeded not.
493,REVERIE,
494,REVERIE,"'Tis silent in the avenue,"

528,THE THREE BEGGARS,"There's fee, if fee ye must!"""
529,THE THREE BEGGARS,
530,THE THREE BEGGARS,"The second, that was a chestnut man,"

539,THE THREE BEGGARS,
540,THE THREE BEGGARS,"That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,"
541,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!"
542,THE THREE BEGGARS,Beneath her finger taper-tipped
543,THE THREE BEGGARS,The magic all ran through.
544,THE THREE BEGGARS,
545,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Instead of crust a peacock pie,"
546,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Instead of bone sweet venison,"
547,THE THREE BEGGARS,Instead of groat a white lily
548,THE THREE BEGGARS,With seven blooms thereon.
549,THE THREE BEGGARS,
550,THE THREE BEGGARS,And each fair cup was deep with wine:
551,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Such was the changeling's charity,"
552,THE THREE BEGGARS,"The sweet feast was enough for nine,"
553,THE THREE BEGGARS,But not too much for three.

555,THE THREE BEGGARS,O toothsome meat in jelly froze!

676,THE PEDLAR,
677,THE PEDLAR,There came a pedlar to an evening house;
678,THE PEDLAR,"Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,"
679,THE PEDLAR,"Wondered what man he was, so curious"
680,THE PEDLAR,His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:
681,THE PEDLAR,"Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--"
682,THE PEDLAR,"""What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,"
683,THE PEDLAR,"And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,"
684,THE PEDLAR,"Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,"
685,THE PEDLAR,To keep in water for to make night sweet:
686,THE PEDLAR,"All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!"""
687,THE PEDLAR,
688,THE PEDLAR,"Even with his sugared words, returned to her"
689,THE PEDLAR,The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:
690,THE PEDLAR,"""And O! my child, should ever a flatterer"
691,THE PEDLAR,"Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys,"
692,THE PEDLAR,"And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be,"
693,THE PEDLAR,"Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,"
694,THE PEDLAR,Confuse his magic who is all mockery:
695,THE PEDLAR,"His sweets are death."" Yet, still how she doth long"
696,THE PEDLAR,"But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,"
697,THE PEDLAR,And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!
698,THE PEDLAR,
699,THE PEDLAR,"""What must I pay?"" she whispered. ""Pay!"" says he,"
700,THE PEDLAR,"""Pedlar I am who through this wood to roam,"
701,THE PEDLAR,"One lock of her hair is gold enough for me,"
702,THE PEDLAR,"For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!"""
703,THE PEDLAR,"But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,"
704,THE PEDLAR,"""Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!"""
705,THE PEDLAR,And many another woodland tongue beside
706,THE PEDLAR,"Rose softly in the silence--""Trust him not!"""
707,THE PEDLAR,"Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,"
708,THE PEDLAR,"""What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?"""
709,THE PEDLAR,
710,THE PEDLAR,"A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,"
711,THE PEDLAR,"As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;"
712,THE PEDLAR,"Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--"
713,THE PEDLAR,"""What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?"
714,THE PEDLAR,"Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,"
715,THE PEDLAR,"Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,"
716,THE PEDLAR,"A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,"
717,THE PEDLAR,"A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:"
718,THE PEDLAR,"Come now,"" he says, with dim and lifted face,"
719,THE PEDLAR,"""I pass not often such a lonely place."""
720,THE PEDLAR,
721,THE PEDLAR,"""Pluck not a hair!"" a hidden rabbit cried,"
722,THE PEDLAR,"""With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,"
723,THE PEDLAR,Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:
724,THE PEDLAR,"Go in! all honest pedlars come by day."""
725,THE PEDLAR,There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;
726,THE PEDLAR,"""Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;"
727,THE PEDLAR,"And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food"
728,THE PEDLAR,"All day thy heart in happiness to keep"";--"
729,THE PEDLAR,"And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--"
730,THE PEDLAR,"""O, then, no more unto my lattice come!"""
731,THE PEDLAR,
732,THE PEDLAR,Sad is the sound of weeping in the wood!
733,THE PEDLAR,Now only night is where the Pedlar was;
734,THE PEDLAR,And bleak as frost upon a quickling bud
735,THE PEDLAR,"His magic steals in darkness, O alas!"
736,THE PEDLAR,Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?
737,THE PEDLAR,"And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold"
738,THE PEDLAR,Hid 'neath fresh new-plucked sprigs of eglantine?
739,THE PEDLAR,"Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,"
740,THE PEDLAR,"Sad, to and fro, in green and secret ways,"
741,THE PEDLAR,With solemn bells the burden of his days?
742,THE PEDLAR,
743,THE PEDLAR,"And, in the market-place, what man is this"
744,THE PEDLAR,"Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,"
745,THE PEDLAR,Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries
746,THE PEDLAR,Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest
747,THE PEDLAR,Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye
748,THE PEDLAR,Remember a face lovely in a wood?
749,THE PEDLAR,"O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy"
750,THE PEDLAR,His woeful wares; the bird of grief doth brood
751,THE PEDLAR,There where his heart should be; and far away
752,THE PEDLAR,There mourns long sorrowfulness this happy day.

780,THE OGRE,Into the garden sweet with peas
781,THE OGRE,"He put his wooden shoe,"
782,THE OGRE,And bending back the apple trees
783,THE OGRE,Crept covetously through;
784,THE OGRE,
785,THE OGRE,"Then, stooping, with a gloating eye"
786,THE OGRE,"Stared through the lattice small,"

804,THE OGRE,
805,THE OGRE,For she who in the kitchen sat
806,THE OGRE,"Darning by the fire,"
807,THE OGRE,"Guileless of what he would be at,"
808,THE OGRE,Sang sweet as wind or wire:--
809,THE OGRE,
810,THE OGRE,"""Lullay, thou little tiny child,"

819,THE OGRE,
820,THE OGRE,The Ogre lifted up his eyes
821,THE OGRE,"Into the moon's pale ray,"
822,THE OGRE,"And gazed upon her leopard-wise,"
823,THE OGRE,Cruel and clear as day;
824,THE OGRE,
825,THE OGRE,He snarled in gluttony and fear--
826,THE OGRE,"""The wind blows dismally--"
827,THE OGRE,"Jesu in storm my lambs be near,"

829,THE OGRE,
830,THE OGRE,And like a ravenous beast which sees

832,THE OGRE,So did this wretch in wrath confess
833,THE OGRE,Sweet Jesu's mastery.
834,THE OGRE,
835,THE OGRE,Lightly he drew his greedy thumb

1130,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Clear sang the faint far merry peal, then silence on the air,"
1131,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,And icy-still the frozen pool and poplars standing there:

1348,THE PHANTOM,What shapes may not conceal
1349,THE PHANTOM,"Their faces in the open day,"

1351,THE PHANTOM,
1352,THE PHANTOM,Even her taper seems with fear
1353,THE PHANTOM,To languish small and blue;
1354,THE PHANTOM,Far in the woods the winter wind
1355,THE PHANTOM,Runs whistling through.
1356,THE PHANTOM,
1357,THE PHANTOM,"A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,"
1358,THE PHANTOM,"Her mouth is stretched to cry,"
1359,THE PHANTOM,"But sudden, with a gush of joy,"
1360,THE PHANTOM,It narrows to a sigh.
1361,THE PHANTOM,
1362,THE PHANTOM,It is a phantom child which comes
1363,THE PHANTOM,"Soft through the corridor,"
1364,THE PHANTOM,"Singing an old forgotten song,"

1382,THE PHANTOM,That spouteth out the same;
1383,THE PHANTOM,
1384,THE PHANTOM,"And in her hand she bore no flower,"
1385,THE PHANTOM,But on her head a wreath
1386,THE PHANTOM,Of faded flowers that did yet

1395,THE PHANTOM,"Heavy and thick the tome,"
1396,THE PHANTOM,A beauty beyond fear to dim
1397,THE PHANTOM,Haunts now her alien home.

1399,THE PHANTOM,"Ghosts in the world, malignant, grim,"
1400,THE PHANTOM,"Vex many a wood and glen,"
1401,THE PHANTOM,"And house and pool--the unquiet ghosts,"
1402,THE PHANTOM,Of dead and restless men.
1403,THE PHANTOM,
1404,THE PHANTOM,But in her grannie's house this spirit--
1405,THE PHANTOM,A child as lone as she--
1406,THE PHANTOM,"Pining for love not found on earth,"
1407,THE PHANTOM,Ann dreams again to see.
1408,THE PHANTOM,
1409,THE PHANTOM,"Seated upon her tapestry stool,"

2184,LULLABY,Looks like a shepherd through the pane
2185,LULLABY,Seeking his feeble lamp again--
2186,LULLABY,"Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul."
2187,LULLABY,
2188,LULLABY,"Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul;"
2189,LULLABY,"Time comes to keep night-watch with thee,"
2190,LULLABY,Nodding with roses; and the sea
2191,LULLABY,"Saith ""Peace! Peace!"" amid his foam."
2192,LULLABY,"""O be still!"""
2193,LULLABY,The wind cries up the whispering hill--
2194,LULLABY,"Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul."

2215,ENVOI,For a dream's brief while.
2216,ENVOI,
2217,ENVOI,Then I shall be old; and away:
2218,ENVOI,"And you, with sad joy in your eyes,"
2219,ENVOI,Will brood over children at play
2220,ENVOI,With as loveful surmise.
