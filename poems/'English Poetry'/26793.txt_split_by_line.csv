28,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND
29,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
30,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
31,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"The King he o’er the castle rules,"
32,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,He rules o’er all the land;
33,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"O’er many a hardy hero too,"
34,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With naked sword in hand.
35,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
36,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Let the courtier govern his steed,"
37,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"The boor his thatchèd cot,"
38,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"But Denmark’s King o’er castles rules,"
39,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,For nobler is his lot.
40,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
41,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"King Diderik sits on Brattingsborg,"
42,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And round he looks with pride:
43,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“No one I know of in the world
44,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Would me in fight abide.”
45,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
46,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then answered Brand Sir Viferlin,"
47,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Had been in many a land:
48,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“Methinks I know a warrior stout
49,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Would thee in fight withstand.
50,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
51,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“He’s Ifald call’d, a king is he,"
52,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,In Birting’s land afar;
53,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And he has fellows following him
54,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With savage wolves who war.
55,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
56,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“O he has fellows following him
57,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,’Gainst teeth of bears who fight;
58,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The food in which he most delights
59,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Is flesh of Christian wight.
60,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
61,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“Every day in the East that dawns
62,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,His mouth he’s wont to cool
63,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"With serpents, toads, and other filth,"
64,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,That come from the hellish pool.”
65,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
66,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,As Ifald sat on his throne that day
67,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,He thus was heard to cry:
68,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“Let some one bid my little foot page
69,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,To come to me instantly.
70,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
71,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Now list to me, thou little foot page,"
72,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,On my errand thee I’ll send
73,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Unto the King of Brattingsborg,"
74,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,To whom I am no friend.
75,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
76,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Tell him that he must tribute pay,"
77,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Or for bloody war prepare;
78,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Forsooth if him in the field I meet
79,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,I him will little spare.”
80,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
81,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Then answered straight the little foot page
82,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And a gallant answer he gave:
83,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“My Lord thy message I’ll carry forth,"
84,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Though they lay me in my grave.”
85,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
86,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"In came he, the little foot page,"
87,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And stood before the board:
88,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Now list to me, King Diderik,"
89,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,My master has sent you word.
90,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
91,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Either tribute thou shalt pay,"
92,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"As thou didst last year agree,"
93,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Or thou shalt meet us in the field,"
94,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And bloodshed there shall be.”
95,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
96,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“I will not tribute pay, forsooth,"
97,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,I scorn to stoop so low;
98,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Nay, rather unto Birting’s land"
99,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With sword unsheathed I go.”
100,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
101,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then answer’d Vitting Helfredson,"
102,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And loud he laughed with glee:
103,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“If ye fare this year into Birting’s land
104,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,I too of the troop shall be.
105,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
106,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Last year wast thou in Birting’s land,"
107,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And there didst lose thy steed;
108,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Thou hadst better stay in Brattingsborg
109,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Than again seek Birting’s mead.”
110,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
111,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“On me, if I stay in Brattingsborg,"
112,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Be every malison;
113,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,If I have no horse on which to ride
114,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,I have legs on which to run.”
115,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
116,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,There rode out from Brattingsborg
117,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,So many a knight renown’d;
118,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"The rocks were split ’neath the coursers’ feet,"
119,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And quaked the startled ground.
120,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
121,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"There rode forth King Diderik,"
122,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The lion upon his shield;
123,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And there too glittered the golden crown
124,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,So far across the field.
125,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
126,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"There rode Vidrik Verlandson,"
127,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The hammer and tongs he bore;
128,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And there rode good King Esmer’s sons,"
129,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,All men of wondrous power.
130,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
131,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"There rode the rich Count Rodengard,"
132,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,A warrior stout and fine;
133,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And there rode King Sir Sigfred, who"
134,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Displayed a monarch’s sign.
135,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
136,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then followed Siward Snarenswayne,"
137,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With many arrows white;
138,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And then came Brand Sir Viferlin,"
139,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who never fled from fight.
140,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
141,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And next rode Hero Hogen,"
142,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,He looked a rose so brave;
143,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And then rode Folker Spillemand,"
144,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,In his hand a naked glaive.
145,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
146,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then rode the bold young Ulf Van Yern,"
147,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,A glorious horse upon;
148,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Behind him young Sir Humble rode,"
149,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And then Sir Sigfredson.
150,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
151,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And then rode Gunther and Gernot,"
152,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With arrow on bended bow;
153,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And there rode Sonne Tolkerson,"
154,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With courage upon his brow.
155,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
156,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"There rode the little Grimmer,"
157,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,In golden acton dight;
158,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And there rode Seyer the active,"
159,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who yields to none in might.
160,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
161,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And then came master Hildebrand,"
162,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,As though to his courser fixt;
163,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The stalwart friar Alsing rode
164,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The ancient hero next.
165,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
166,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"There rode Orm the Ungarswayne,"
167,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,So bold of heart was he;
168,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"So joyous were they every one,"
169,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And sure of victory.
170,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
171,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Out galloped they all from Brattingsborg,"
172,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,As fast as they could speed;
173,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"But Vitting bold came running behind,"
174,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Because he had no steed.
175,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
176,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"It was hardy Angelfyr,"
177,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,To Grimselin he cried:
178,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“O, he must on his bare legs run"
179,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who has no horse to ride!”
180,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
181,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And still ran Vitting, and still ran he,"
182,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Till with wrath he nigh was wode;
183,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Then he struck a warrior from his horse
184,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And sat himself on, and rode."
185,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
186,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"It was Sir King Diderik,"
187,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,He back a glance did throw:
188,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“O yonder I see the courtier ride
189,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who on foot was wont to go.
190,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
191,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Here thou, Vitting Helfredson,"
192,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Thou art a warrior bold;
193,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Thou shalt hie forward to Birting’s land,"
194,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And demand the tribute gold.
195,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
196,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“With thee shall Vidrik Verlandson,"
197,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And Diderik knight of Bern;
198,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Of all my troop they are best at blows,"
199,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And most for battle yearn.”
200,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
201,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"They set themselves upon their steeds,"
202,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And away they rode like wind;
203,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"The knights they roared, and their steeds they gored,"
204,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,For wroth were they in mind.
205,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
206,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The watchman stood on the battlement
207,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,From whence he far could see:
208,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“Yonder I warriors three espy
209,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who wrathful seem to be.
210,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
211,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“The one is Vitting Helfredson
212,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who lost his steed last year;
213,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,That a rugged guest he’ll prove to us
214,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,We have full cause to fear.
215,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
216,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“The second is Vidrik Verlandson,"
217,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,As the tongs and hammer shew;
218,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"The third is Diderik Van Bern,"
219,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"All warriors good, I trow.”"
220,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
221,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"They left their steeds in the castle yard,"
222,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,To the castle strode they in;
223,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Then might each man by their faces see
224,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,A fray would soon begin.
225,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
226,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Upon the porter they laid their hands,"
227,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And him to pieces hew’d;
228,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then in they strode to the high, high hall,"
229,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And before the King they stood.
230,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
231,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then up rose Ifald the King in rage,"
232,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And thus the King did cry:
233,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“O, whence are come the ill-starr’d loons"
234,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Before my board I spy?”
235,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
236,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then answered the skinker of the King,"
237,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Who skinkèd wine and mead:
238,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Our sharp spears, if we ply them well,"
239,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Will drive them out with speed.”
240,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
241,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"It was Vitting Helfredson,"
242,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,By the beard the skinker has ta’en;
243,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"He smote him a blow the ear below,"
244,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Which dashed out half his brain.
245,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
246,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"He flung the dead corse on the board,"
247,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And a merry jest had he:
248,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"“Who’ll taste,” said Vitting Helfredson,"
249,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,“This precious roast for me?”
250,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
251,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then forth stepped Diderik Van Bern,"
252,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And, brandishing his glaive,"
253,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"He hewed upon King Ifald’s head,"
254,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And him to the navel clave.
255,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
256,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"And forth stepped Vidrik Verlandson,"
257,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And round began to hew;
258,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Heads and arms were smitten off
259,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,As round and round he flew.
260,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
261,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"In came King Ifald’s mother grey,"
262,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With an eldritch scream she came;
263,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,I tell to ye in verity
264,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,There ensued a wondrous game.
265,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
266,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Vitting struck her with his sword,"
267,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,A very fearful stroke;
268,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"But she kissed asunder the good sword,"
269,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Into pieces three it broke.
270,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
271,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,With a single kiss of the witch’s mouth
272,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Was shivered the trusty sword;
273,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Vitting the hag by the weazand seized,"
274,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Without a single word.
275,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
276,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"The beldame changed herself to a crane,"
277,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And flew to the clouds on high;
278,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"But Vitting donned a feather robe,"
279,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And pursued her through the sky.
280,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
281,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"They flew for a day, they flew for three,"
282,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,Bold Vitting and the crane;
283,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Then Vitting seized the crane by the legs,"
284,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And her body rent in twain.
285,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,
286,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"Homeward now, with sword in hand,"
287,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,The valiant comrades wended:
288,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,"All the Birting kemps are dead,"
289,THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING’S LAND,And the adventure ended.

298,THE SINGING MARINER,"Who will ever have again,"
299,THE SINGING MARINER,"On the land or on the main,"
300,THE SINGING MARINER,Such a chance as happen’d to
301,THE SINGING MARINER,Count Arnaldos long ago.
302,THE SINGING MARINER,
303,THE SINGING MARINER,"With his falcon in his hand,"
304,THE SINGING MARINER,Forth he went along the strand;
305,THE SINGING MARINER,"There he saw a galley gay,"
306,THE SINGING MARINER,Briskly bearing for the bay.
307,THE SINGING MARINER,
308,THE SINGING MARINER,"Ask me not her name and trade,—"
309,THE SINGING MARINER,All the sails of silk were made;
310,THE SINGING MARINER,He who steer’d the ship along
311,THE SINGING MARINER,"Raised his voice, and sang a song."
312,THE SINGING MARINER,
313,THE SINGING MARINER,Sang a song whose magic force
314,THE SINGING MARINER,Calm’d the breaker in its course;
315,THE SINGING MARINER,"While the fishes, sore amazed,"
316,THE SINGING MARINER,Left their holes and upward gazed.
317,THE SINGING MARINER,
318,THE SINGING MARINER,"And the fowl came flocking fast,"
319,THE SINGING MARINER,Round the summit of the mast;
320,THE SINGING MARINER,Still he sang to wind and wave:
321,THE SINGING MARINER,“God preserve my vessel brave!
322,THE SINGING MARINER,
323,THE SINGING MARINER,“Guard her from the rocks that grow
324,THE SINGING MARINER,’Mid the sullen deep below;
325,THE SINGING MARINER,"From the gust, and from the breeze,"
326,THE SINGING MARINER,Sweeping through Gibtarek’s seas.
327,THE SINGING MARINER,
328,THE SINGING MARINER,"“From the gulf of Venice too,"
329,THE SINGING MARINER,With its shoals and waters blue;
330,THE SINGING MARINER,"Where the mermaid chants her hymn,"
331,THE SINGING MARINER,Borne upon the billow’s brim.”
332,THE SINGING MARINER,
333,THE SINGING MARINER,"Forward stept Arnaldos bold,"
334,THE SINGING MARINER,"Thus he spake, as I am told:"
335,THE SINGING MARINER,"“Teach me, sailor, I entreat,"
336,THE SINGING MARINER,Yonder song that sounds so sweet.”
337,THE SINGING MARINER,
338,THE SINGING MARINER,"But the sailor shook his head,"
339,THE SINGING MARINER,"Shook it thrice, and briefly said:"
340,THE SINGING MARINER,“Never will I teach the strain
341,THE SINGING MARINER,But to him who ploughs the main.”

352,YOUTH’S SONG IN SPRING,"Take sorrow away,"

354,YOUTH’S SONG IN SPRING,
355,YOUTH’S SONG IN SPRING,"O, when every thing is as joyous in Spring,"

371,THE NIGHTINGALE,’Tis Philomel’s notes that invite.
372,THE NIGHTINGALE,"A fowler attentively follows her there,"
373,THE NIGHTINGALE,Resolv’d for his victim to spread out a snare:
374,THE NIGHTINGALE,"_Think_, _girls_, _of the Nightingale’s fate_, _and beware_!"
375,THE NIGHTINGALE,
376,THE NIGHTINGALE,"In ambush his nets he carefully brings,"
377,THE NIGHTINGALE,Glad innocence feels no alarm;
378,THE NIGHTINGALE,Unguarded her flight—’midst danger she wings—
379,THE NIGHTINGALE,And falls into sorrowful harm.
380,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Alas! she is silent, and full of despair,"
381,THE NIGHTINGALE,He glides away quick with his treasure so rare:
382,THE NIGHTINGALE,"_Think_, _girls_, _of the Nightingale’s fate_, _and beware_!"
383,THE NIGHTINGALE,
384,THE NIGHTINGALE,"A beautiful cage adorns his fair prize,"
385,THE NIGHTINGALE,In hope that for him she will sing;
386,THE NIGHTINGALE,"But Freedom, that wafted her notes to the skies,"
387,THE NIGHTINGALE,Bore Gladness away on its wing.
388,THE NIGHTINGALE,"Thus you, Philomela, resemble the fair,"
389,THE NIGHTINGALE,"And we, we delight in the love that we share:"
390,THE NIGHTINGALE,"_O_, _think of the Nightingale’s fate_, _and beware_!"

460,THE MORNING WALK,THE MORNING WALK
461,THE MORNING WALK,
462,THE MORNING WALK,
463,THE MORNING WALK,To the beech grove with so sweet an air
464,THE MORNING WALK,It beckon’d me.
465,THE MORNING WALK,"O, Earth! that never the cruel plough-share"
466,THE MORNING WALK,Had furrow’d thee!
467,THE MORNING WALK,"In their dark shelter the flowerets grew,"
468,THE MORNING WALK,"Bright to the eye,"
469,THE MORNING WALK,"And smil’d by my foot on the cloudlets blue,"
470,THE MORNING WALK,Which deck’d the sky.
471,THE MORNING WALK,
472,THE MORNING WALK,To the wood through a field I took my way;
473,THE MORNING WALK,There I could see
474,THE MORNING WALK,"On the field an uppil’d stone-heap lay,"
475,THE MORNING WALK,’Twixt hillocks three;
476,THE MORNING WALK,"So anciently grayly white it stood,"
477,THE MORNING WALK,An oblong ring:
478,THE MORNING WALK,Here doubtless was held in the old time good
479,THE MORNING WALK,A royal Ting.
480,THE MORNING WALK,
481,THE MORNING WALK,"The royal stone, which there doth stand,"
482,THE MORNING WALK,"The Stol-king press’d,"
483,THE MORNING WALK,"With crown on head, and sceptre in hand,"
484,THE MORNING WALK,In sables drest.
485,THE MORNING WALK,And every warrior solemnly pac’d
486,THE MORNING WALK,"Peaceful in thought,"
487,THE MORNING WALK,And down on his stone himself calmly plac’d—
488,THE MORNING WALK,No sword he brought.
489,THE MORNING WALK,
490,THE MORNING WALK,"The king’s house stood on yonder height,"
491,THE MORNING WALK,With walls of power;
492,THE MORNING WALK,"On yon had his daughter, the damsel bright,"
493,THE MORNING WALK,Her maiden bower.
494,THE MORNING WALK,"Upon the third the temple stood,"
495,THE MORNING WALK,"Through the North famed wide,"
496,THE MORNING WALK,"Where to Thor was offered the he-goat’s blood,"
497,THE MORNING WALK,In reeking tide.
498,THE MORNING WALK,
499,THE MORNING WALK,"O, lovely field! and forest fair,"
500,THE MORNING WALK,And meads grass-clad;
501,THE MORNING WALK,Her bride-bed Freya every where
502,THE MORNING WALK,Enamelled had.
503,THE MORNING WALK,The corn-flowers rose in azure band
504,THE MORNING WALK,From earthly cell;
505,THE MORNING WALK,"Nought else could I do but stop and stand,"
506,THE MORNING WALK,And greet them well.
507,THE MORNING WALK,
508,THE MORNING WALK,"Welcome on earth’s green breast again,"
509,THE MORNING WALK,Ye flowerets dear!
510,THE MORNING WALK,In spring how charming ’mid the grain
511,THE MORNING WALK,Your heads ye rear.
512,THE MORNING WALK,Like stars ’midst lightning’s yellow ray
513,THE MORNING WALK,"Ye shine red, blue:"
514,THE MORNING WALK,"O, how your summer aspect gay"
515,THE MORNING WALK,Delights my view.
516,THE MORNING WALK,
517,THE MORNING WALK,"O poet! poet! silence keep,"
518,THE MORNING WALK,God help thy case:
519,THE MORNING WALK,"Our owner holds us sadly cheap,"
520,THE MORNING WALK,And scorns our race.
521,THE MORNING WALK,"Each time he sees, he calls us scum,"
522,THE MORNING WALK,Or worthless tares;
523,THE MORNING WALK,Hell-weeds that but to vex him come
524,THE MORNING WALK,’Midst his corn-ears.
525,THE MORNING WALK,
526,THE MORNING WALK,The greatest grace done for our sake
527,THE MORNING WALK,"In all his life,"
528,THE MORNING WALK,Is from his pocket deep to take
529,THE MORNING WALK,His huge clasp knife;
530,THE MORNING WALK,"And heavy handful then to cut,"
531,THE MORNING WALK,’Midst grumbling much—
532,THE MORNING WALK,Us with tobacco leaves to put
533,THE MORNING WALK,In seal-skin pouch.
534,THE MORNING WALK,
535,THE MORNING WALK,"He says, he says, that smoked this way,"
536,THE MORNING WALK,"We dross of the field,"
537,THE MORNING WALK,"To the world by chance, by poor chance, may"
538,THE MORNING WALK,Some benefit yield;
539,THE MORNING WALK,"But as for our beauty, our blue and red hues,"
540,THE MORNING WALK,’Tis folly indeed—
541,THE MORNING WALK,"The mouth is his only test of use,"
542,THE MORNING WALK,And that’s his creed.
543,THE MORNING WALK,
544,THE MORNING WALK,O wretched mortals!—O wretched man!
545,THE MORNING WALK,O wretched crowd!—
546,THE MORNING WALK,No pleasures ye pluck—no pleasures ye plan
547,THE MORNING WALK,In life’s lone road:—
548,THE MORNING WALK,Whose eyes are blind to the glories great
549,THE MORNING WALK,Of the works of God;
550,THE MORNING WALK,And dream that the mouth is the nearest gate
551,THE MORNING WALK,To joy’s abode.
552,THE MORNING WALK,
553,THE MORNING WALK,"Come flowers! for we to each other belong,"
554,THE MORNING WALK,"Come graceful elf,"
555,THE MORNING WALK,And around my lute in sympathy strong
556,THE MORNING WALK,Now wind thyself;
557,THE MORNING WALK,"And quake as if mov’d by zephyr’s wing,"
558,THE MORNING WALK,"’Neath the clang of the chord,"
559,THE MORNING WALK,And a morning song with glee we’ll sing
560,THE MORNING WALK,To our Maker and Lord!
